(Commentator) On the auspicious occasion
of Dussehra,
we welcome you to Uttar Pradesh Kesari,
the annual wrestling contest.
On your right is ex-minister
Balram Tripathi's candidate,
Raju Patil of Hubbali in Karnataka.
On your left,
Manindar Singh, the candidate
of Omkar Shuka minister from Lucknow.
Both wrestlers are true sons of the soil.
Their intense fight is providing
wholesome entertainment to the spectators.
(Commentary runs in the background)
??
Don't let that b@#$%^D go!???
Hold on to him like a leech!
What nonsense is he upto!
Thought he'd fight like a lion.
But he's losing the battle like a mouse!
Loser! Has fattened up like a buffalo!
Go on! Beat him up!
(Commentary runs in the background)
I didn't get you here
to get a damn massage!
Remember you're barely clothed,
if you lose,
I'll parade you naked around the ground!
You'll become a viral sensation!
Go on and win this match!
Hey, Tripathi!
How long will you keep coochie cooing
into his ears!!
Go on now!
Yes, carry on,
we'll beat you all into a pulp!
Beat to pulp?
And you?
I swear on Bhajrang Bali,
I'll teach you a lesson
that you won't forget!
Let's wait and watch.
(Commentator) Raju enters the ring;
the match resumes.
Mr. Shukla is confident of his candidate.
Wow! What a twist to the game!
Raju displays his prowess,
overthrows his competitor
and wins the match!
??
Mr. Tripathi is clearly overjoyed!
His whole team runs towards the ring
in jubilation!
Mr. Shukla! Wait!
This joyful moment
definitely calls for a selfie, isn't it?
Come, let's get a sexy selfie!
Yeah sure. Wait until the next game.
I'll show you who the ultimate winner is!
The one who loses is as good as dead.
Losers grieve while winners celebrate!
What a perfect aim!
Had my boys been even a second late
in lifting up that wrestler,
you'd have killed me on the spot,
isn't it?
Sir, please forgive me!
I know that you're the mason
who's come to build my tomb.
But the engineer who has designed
this plan is someone else!
So tell me, who is that?
I, Omkar Shukla, is not an MLA.
I'm your humble servant!
He's a smooth operator, dad.
It should look like an accident,
but his job should be accomplished, too.
He's hatched a smart plan
to finish you off!
It's not enough to plan smart;
the plan has to be successful, too.
It will be!
But with a single arrow,
it's only possible to vanquish a single Ravana!
It's not that easy to finish off someone
If you make up your mind,
nothing is impossible!
According to me,
you are all replicas of Lord Rama
You all have a weapon called "vote"
in your hands
And if you give that to me
in the next election too,
I will destroy the evil elements
And make a sincere effort
to ensure that you'll lead a peaceful life
If someone has set out to destroy me,
then he must be a bigger criminal than me itself
He must be a bigger terror than me!
He must be more violent than me!
Only then can I be finished!
And is there anyone who dares do that to me?!
Anyone at all??
Anyone at all??
This Navarathi, I wish all of you...
Like God himself, my wrestler saved me
in the nick of time
Who will come to save that Shukla,
God alone knows!
(People hailing the name of Lord Sri Rama)
Wow! What amazing might you have displayed!
Sir!
That Hanuman lifted the Sanjeevini mountain
and saved Laxmana
This Hanuma lifted the cutout and saved me!
I'm your fan now son!
From now on, your cutout will be in my heart!
Superman, Iron Man are all heroes only in films
But the real hero is you!
What's your name son?
Raghava, sir
(Stammers) This is my son
What's your name boy?
(Stammers) Arjun
We fondly call him as laddu!
Who is he?
My friend, sir
Just like Anjaneya's tail,
I'm behind him all the time!
Raghava,
henceforth I'm your police, ambulance,
insurance, bank balance,
24 hours any time, any where!
This Raghava is the deity of my home henceforth!
I'll leave now
Jai Ram Ji Ki
- Jai Ram Ji Ki
Boss,
you took so much trouble to lift that cutout
to protect that minister?
Boss!
Then why did that uncle get so emotional?
That's how it is, laddu
Even though Lord Rama killed Ravana
to save Seetha,
doesn't the whole world celebrate it?
This is like that, too
Really?
Yes, Jai Sri Ram!
Jai Sri Ram!!
Ramaya Rama Bhadraya Ramachandraya Vedase
Raghunathaya Nathaya Seethaya Pathye Namaha
Praise the lord
Chant Lord Rama's name and he will arrive
And he will be accompanied by Hanuman
Jai Sri Ram!
Jai Sri Ram!
He is the Lord of the Universe
He is the perfect example to the whole world
Jai Sri Ram!
Jai Sri Ram!
Even the vedas pay ode to him
His name rings loud everywhere
The verses are in praise of him
Jai Sri Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Ram
Chant Lord Rama's name and he will arrive
And he will be accompanied by Hanuman
His arrows have never missed the mark
Rama Rama Jai Rama Rama
Hanuman, Seetha and Rama are the lifelines
Rama Rama Jai Janaki Rama
He has never faulted on the given word
The one who ate another's morsel owing to devotion
He is the king of all the worlds
He is a legend and the picture of perfection
When you write Jai Sri Rama
Every birth will be a blessed one
Those who chant his name will always have goodness
Chanting his name shall rid you of your sins
Come and sing his praise
Jai Sri Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Ram
It is the arrow of Rama
that quelled the evil Ravana
It is Hanuman who aided him in this victory
Jai Sri Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama Ram
Jai Sri Ram!!
Take this photo, put it in a 20 by 30 frame
and hang it in my bedroom!
Let me wake up every morning and sing his praise!
You idiots!
What shall I do with this photo, huh??
Why didn't you kill him on the spot!!
There were many others there
in similar Hanuman costume
He has come in the way of Balram Tripathi!
Go search for him and chop him into pieces!
Go!
Search and bring him here!
Get out!
Where the hell are you?
Where the hell are you?
Bossu! I'm ready!
Coming
Come soon!
Let's go?
Don't think I'll make it to office today...
Coming, sorry sir!
Did you find only my home
to park your rickety vehicle! Move it!
But you had space to go, isn't it sir?
Talking back to me?
Do you know who am I?
The new kickboxer of old Lucknow!
My single kick will be enough
to flatten you on the floor!
Be off with your junk now!
Bossu, give me a minute;
poor fellow, his bike refuses to start
Boss, but he's a kickboxer!
You think he can't manage
to kickstart a mere bike??
Let's go now
Jai Ram Ji Ki
- Jai Ram Ji Ki
Is this milk for real?
Seems like it's adulterated!
The milk has curdled early in the morning!
Everyone was angry with me at home!
What takes you so long to bring the vessel!
If you take your own sweet time,
henceforth I'll charge you extra!
Sorry brother!
Don't keep saying sir on repeat mode!
What's this brother, the milk is so watery!
If you can drink it,
or else wash your face with it!
For the money you pay,
can I put honey into it?
Get lost!
Trying to act smart with me!
If you cheat us like this, you'll rot in hell!
Take this! Here!
So sad, our brother Gopal!
Hey wait! I'll be late for school!
Bye Boss!
Boss!
Yes?
Revenge is not a good thing, boss
Oh, he got to know is it?
Boss, we watched a video the other day.
Do you remember?
Which one boss?
The one where a single dog barks
and scares a mighty lion away!
Oh yeah!
What did you feel when you watched that video?
I felt like shouting at the man
who taped that video!
Doesn't he have any humanity?
Instead of breaking up their fight,
he stood taping it!
Oh god!
It has two messages\
N#1: If a lion is silent,
even dogs will attack him
#2:
If it's a dog and he fears no one,
even a lion will remain silent
How will you understand these things?
You're such a duffer!
If you don't take revenge,
evil people will chew us up like oranges!
Be careful and go home. Bye!
Oh god!
Hello there Mr Funeral Bhat!
Mister, I'm not Funeral Bhat
My name is Vishwanath Bhat
But you're the only one who cooks south Indian food
for death ceremonies in Lucknow, right?
Hence!
Are you free on the 11th?
Why?
My grandfather is in the ICU
His last wish is that
you should cater for his death ceremony!
Here, take the advance. Bye
See you
Brother in law, shall I take off
the Amritha Catering Service board
and put up
death anniversary catering service instead?
Sure!
Taunt all you want
My daughter Amritha,
is returning today after finishing
her hotel management course in London
After her return...
So we will supply food
to the death anniversaries of foreigners, too?
I'm quiet because you're my wife's brother
If not, I'd have completed
your death anniversary by now
Go call Raghava now
Raghava hasn't come yet
Please tell me what the matter is
I have some work. I'm going out
Ask Raghava to go to the airport
and pick up Amritha
Ok your honour
Also ask Babu to go to city market
and buy vegetables
And please don't forget
to tell Raghavan to pick Amritha
Ok. Rest in peace
My brother in law is asking
his own daughter to be picked up.
Dirty fellow!
Hello brother!
Jai Ram Ji Ki
- Jai Ram Ji Ki
Keep this inside
Ok brother
Mr Mohandad, here's the tablet you wanted
Thank son
Madan, why are you cooking
with your mobile in hand?
First you change your mentality
What's wrong if I cook
with a mobile in my hand?
Why don't you think positively
that I can multi task?
I'm sure you know about us Mandyans.
Even with our eyes closed,
we can fire a gun perfectly
Please add some salt
Ok
Hey, Agni!
What's the matter??
Should I do my work or listen to your ranting?
That owner of our's is always whining
And here you are always yelling out my name!
First of all we hardly get funeral catering orders,
so why are you killing me for it?
Thank your lucky stars
that I'm a silent and patient man
Had it been someone else,
his BP would've shot
and he'd have burnt this place down!
Take a look at your own hand please...it's burning
Oh damn, it's hurting so much!
Raghava,
I wanted to make a video call
to speak to my family
But nobody is switching on their hot spot
Misers all!
Can you please switch on your hotspot?
My son Laddu keeps saying revenge
and plays PUBG all night
So I don't activate data on my phone now
Is that so?
Yes
Ok
One minute
You wanted to call your family isn't it?
What do we do?
What else to do?
Let me switch on my data pack and call them
200 MB down the drain now!
And he calls others misers!
Come
Everyone in our catering...
Hey stop!
Look, oil...
Someone has spilt oil,
wait let me wipe it
Oh god, wait!
This is a trap that's been laid for a suitor
Look right there
What do you mean?
She has planned this
so that you slip and fall on her
Kamala!
Did you call me, Raghava?
I didn't realise it'd work out this way, too!
Oh god, please let go of me Raghava, please!
Hey you! Where has he held you to let you go?
You're the one who's sticking to him like a magnet!
Are you feeling hot, Raghava?
Go mix batter
Instead of mixing the batter,
she's mixing emotions here!
Stop!
What's up Mister Sous Chef!
Please tell me Nari anna
I think my brother in law mentioned something...
How long should we wait....
Does it take so long to come from the airport?
What do you mean so long?
Have you arranged for zero traffic for him?
Or do I have a third eye to see why he's late?
If you've sent someone,
you should wait until they arrive
or you should go and pick the person up
Instead of that, if you chew
our brains how will it help?
I asked you is it?
Sorry!
Sir! The vehicle is here!
My dear Amritha,
why have you come in an auto??
It's better you ask this question
to the man you sent!
Where's Raghava?
But why are you sitting there, Raghava!
Ma....ma...
What happened son?
Jai Ram Ji Ki madam
- Jai Ram Ji Ki
Madam!
But why a separate auto for the luggage?
We can take it in the car
But this isn't just for the luggage alone, madam
You'll be coming in this too
What!
In a goods auto??
Nonsense!
Taxi....
Madam....
Sir will be angry with me if you go in a taxi
So, you want me to travel in an auto for that?
Rubbish!
Taxi...
Please madam
Where do I sit?
Sorry madam
How far is it?
Just a little further
Stop!!!!
God!
I can't sit sticking to someone
like a chewing gum!
Why? Do you have a skin allergy?
Shall I get you a tablet?
Let me just go in taxi!
No, I won't allow that
Why?
Who are you to order me around?
Please don't mistake me madam
Sir will be upset
He's given me the responsibility
to take you home safely
So please don't go by taxi, please...
please...
Ok,
fine
Under one condition
Our bodies shouldn't touch
while riding together, ok?
Got it?
But
only one person can sit in front
I've seen foreign returnees
being welcome in unique ways
This is the first time that I'm seeing a father
send a goods auto to pick up his daughter
I didn't send it, dear
I had sent a car to fetch you
Hey Raghava, where's the car?
Hi Boss!
What did I ask you guys to do
and what the hell have you done?
Sorry brother in law
I had an extra dose and got confused
Why are you hitting me?
You idiot!
Why don't you have the same interest
in returning a loan as you had while taking it?
For the 25,000 that I borrowed,
I've already paid an interest of 40,000!
How dare you raise your voice with us!
You!
What the hell is going on there, dad?
Let's talk about it inside, please
Sir, take her
But dad
My dear come inside
Let's all go inside
Acting smart with us!
Go on, hit him!
Boss, come in
Wait boss,
the fight has just begun
I want to watch the whole fight
You shouldn't be watching such things
Please leave me
When I watch action films on TV,
you change it to cartoon network
If I play boxing game on the mobile,
you ask me to play temple run
Tell me, don't you ever get angry?
Haven't you ever hit anyone?
Please don't tell anyone this,
but I hate the sight of blood
Oh god!
- Let's go in
Have you seen him anywhere?
No
If you have, then tell me
Ok brother
Hey wait!
Have you seen him anywhere?
No
Think properly and tell us
Hey look!
Come, let's go
What?
Laddu!
Laddu!
Where did he go?
Boss??
What happened, boss?
(Teacher) Dear children,
we will now have pick and talk
Those who are interested,
please give me your names
Miss, I also want to participate
Ma'am can we come to the school with our luggage?
Luggage? Why?
Miss, because Arjun takes an hour to speak
So it will surely take him a week
to complete his pick and talk!
So whenever they get a chance,
they insult me papa
It really hurts
I feel like hugging you tight
and feel like crying
But you're never around
So I have to console myself
Papa,
if my mouth stammers,
is it my fault?
No son,
it's all my fault
Since I have the same problem,
it's passed on to you, too
I'm the reason for it all
Why are you crying, boss?
Please don't
When they insult me, I feel a little hurt
But if you cry, it hurts so much
Henceforth, if they insult me,
I'll forget about it right there
Boss,
these are not things
we should even be worried about
Look there...
Vighneshwara
The one who we all pray to
You and I only have a speech problem
But for him,
the whole body is filled with problems
An elephant head, broken tooth,
a snake entwined stomach...
Despite all these problems,
whatever function we have,
he's the first one we pray to
Boss, do you know Einstein?
Yes, I do
He was a big scientist, isn't it?
But, when he was your age,
he couldn't even speak...
Really?
Yet, he faced all problems boldly
and became an achiever
that the world remembers even today
Frankly, problems of the body mean nothing
It's the problems of the mind
that are a greater problem
If we remove the problem from the mind,
we can achieve anything
Correct boss
I will work on removing this problem
from my mind right away !
I will definitely participate in the pick and talk
There are so many of you working in our catering
To be frank, I haven't liked any of you
So why worry? Let's find you a match
Shut up!
Henceforth, you should all follow my rules
We have a dress code,
so while on duty always wear your uniform
Sure, give us a bag, belt, shoes and tie
We can straight go to school from here
Agni...
- Sorry!
You can use these walkie talkies
to communicate to each other
Another thing,
it's me who has laid these rules
Henceforth, your chief cook is me
and not Raghava
How is this possible madam?
You are depromoting him
without even a notice?
We will have to go on a strike if this is the case
Silence is better than violence,
so please keep quiet
Oh! Playing good guy - bad guy?!
Silence and violence...heavy duty words!
Henceforth, you two are in chopping team
You three in the marinating team
You two in the baking team
You three in the cooking team
What about us?
You both aren't mature enough to be in my team
So you fill water and you can help him
Madam...
Ok madam
Put 3 tablespoons of salt
ok
I repeat, 3 tablespoons of salt
Understood?
- Yes
You think I don't know English?
I'm from Mandya after all!
Tablespoon means the spoon that's on the table
You can't blindly fry papads
The oil has to be at least 150 to 200 degree celsius hot
You've to put in the papad
at a speed of point one km per hour
The ladle has two be 24 inches long,
2 inches thick
and the papad has to be fried
for 7.5 secs on both sides
Then for 18.5 secs you should leave it on the ladle
and has to be put in a box at a speed of .2 kph
Understand?
Madam, can I also go fill water with Raghava?
Do you remember all my instructions?
All of you should neatly....
Hi Amritha!
Hello sir!
Hello! All set?
Yes sir!
Shall I taste it?
Yes sir, please!
Thank you, sir
Wow, good!
Thank you
If you send this food to Pakistan and China,
our borders issues can be sorted right away!
Really sir?
- Yes
They'll die right away after eating it!
So where is the question of going to war!!
Disgusting!
If I feed this to my guests,
they will throw it on my face and not the dustbin!
There's a lot of difference in doing a catering course
and cooking in real life
Just shut your mouth and get lost!
Excuse me sir!
Hello sir
- Yes?
There's been a mistake
The food for your event is here
By mistake, the food made by me
has been laid out there
Please taste this, sir
Nice! Very tasty!
It's all been made by madam
Really?
Sorry Amritha, I yelled at you owing to my tensions
No worries
Really, I'm very sorry
Hey mister,
I yelled at her because of you!
If you do not have dedication,
why do you come to work?
Sorry sir
Priya, inform the guests
Ok
Why are you all staring at me?
Shift all of this to the vehicle and bring what's in there
Ok
Thank you Raghava
Madam, please don't be offended
But to make delicious food,
you don't need measurements
nor do you need uniforms
All you need is some love
Then, whoever cooks, it will be delicious
Babu!
Brother, I've searched in every nook and corner
There's not a single nonveg hotel in your area
If there's no non veg with alcohol,
it's like having a first night without a girl!
Hey Gabbar!
- Yes brother
Is there raw meat in the fridge?
- Yes brother
Who is it?
Who the hell is that at this hour!
Do you even know the problems of bachelors?
We're tired of cooking all day
and were playing candy crush to destress!
And here you'll come like stone crushers
and are disturbing our sleep!
Now I'll have to play candy crush
to feel sleepy again
And if we keep playing candy crush,
it's our fingers that hurt, not yours!
See this sir....
- What's going on here?
What do you want?
Marinate this well and make chicken fry for us
Chicken fry?? No I don't cook meat!
What did you just say?
I'm a vegiitatrain and don't cook meat
It's a sin!
This is dead meat, mister vegiitatrain
You can add masala and perform the final rites
And I shall give it a befitting farewell in my stomach!
We can't do it, you can leave now
Dad! What's happening?
Who the hell are these people??
Daddy's girl! Darling you look so good!
Will you people just get out?
Otherwise, I'll call the police
I am Lalan bhai
Try calling them,
even the police will say wrong number
Brother,
keep the chicken aside
Take a good look at this chick!
She's a goddess!
Can I check your skin out?
Let there be no fight in here brother
So there's a hero inside this stammering personality!
Getting angry?
Want to hit me?
You stammer?
You stammer?
Mr Hero stammers!
What do you want, brother?
I want some spicy chicken fry
I shall make it for you
Raghava! What are you saying?
Sir, I beg of you!
Please don't say anything further
Rascals!
Shall I make a Tik Tok video with this chick, brother?
Go ahead!
Here it is brother...
Gabbar,
let's go
Do you have any idea on what you just did?
Don't you have any sense of purity and cleanliness?
But isn't humanity greater than being pure, sir?
We may not be related by blood,
but all of us are one in times of trouble
I don't know if I'm right or wrong,
but what I know for sure
that goodness can never be touched by sin
And evil can never be a virtue
Good people will always win
It's just a matter of awaiting a good time for that
Why? What happened?
I don’t know, Gabbar.
My hand is hurting a lot.
Seems like I have a broken bone!
But how can that be?
That cook merely held my hand.
Since then, my hand has been hurting so much!
But how can it hurt so much
if he merely held your hand??
I don’t know, man.
But that hand is definitely not that of a vegiitatrain
It’s definitely of a wrestler
Raghava!
Raghava!
You’re here!
St...stop..!
- Raaghu!!!
Rama, Rama!
Krishna, Krishna!
Kamala! Why are you always
so touchy-feely with me!
I can’t help it! I lose control over myself
when I see you!
What is that has made you lose control now?
Do you even know my full name?
Of course! It’s Kamala Chandrashekar. Why?
I desire to put your name along with mine
instead of Chandrashekar
So you want me to become your father?
Won’t your father get upset then?
You fool!
Kamala!
What are you doing here??
What can one do here, ma’am?
That too with this fool!
You can sing and do your chores outside. Go!
Ok
Hi Raghav!
Jai Ram Ji Ki!
God! This fellow is a fool indeed!
Men these days never lose an opportunity to pounce on
empty charging sockets and unmarried girls!
But look at this idiot, least bothered!
Hello miss, what’s up?
When everyone downloads photos from a website,
you’re downloading photos of my boss
with your eyesight?
Sorry!
- I don’t need it!
Continue!
But if you stand this far,
it’ll take really long to download.
Why don’t you go closer and try?
But how?
Come, come!
All the best..
Thank you!
Raghava...
Yes ma’am?
Teach me how to make dough for chapattis
You’ve studied abroad.
Don’t you know how to mix dough, ma’am?
Except for babies,
everything abroad is made by machines
Teach me how to make dough by hand
It’s an order!
To wink the eye
Was something I learnt recently
You please tell me
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
To bite jaggery
Was something I learnt recently
So please extend your chin to me
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
I love you so much
How can I bear it?
How can I not tell you about it?
I want a 100 kids
You keep 50
And I keep 50
My temperature is high
So let the bread quickly fall into butter
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
Pretty flowers
Please adorn my hair with them
Please don't stand afar and smile at me
Oh my king of love
Please come and steal the sugar from my lips
Why are you killing me softly, kiss me quick!
Let the winter set in soon
Let me feel the hotness of your breath
Please hold me tight in front of all,
let the world see it
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
I'm not able to sit in peace
Nor eat in peace
It's been a while since I've gone crazy
I'm struggling
And shower the pillow with love
Even the bed sheets are now doubting me!
Let a ban be put on my single-hood
Let there be a panacea to my lovesickness
Tell me where should I come with my bags?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
How can I contain myself when I see you?
Listen up all. Until now, we were only cooking
for death ceremonies.
They want us to cook all kinds of dishes for this wedding.
The order for south-Indian food has come to us
We should cook well and earn a good name
Understood?
Let’s go
This is for you
- Thank you!
And this to you...
Go play now
Dear boy, come here!
Such a cute fellow! You want a chocolate?
Do you want a cigarette?
What!
I’m your maternal aunt’s husband.
I’m 45 years old
45?
But physically, I haven’t grown much.
Can’t help it
Then what are you doing here with kids?
Go do your work!
Then why did you call me here?
Dear boy, come here!
Such a cute fellow!
What’s your name?
Arjun
Arjun! That’s such a nice name!
Do you want a chocolate?
No, thank you!
Laddu! What are you doing over there?
Come and play in the kitchen
Your father is calling you
Coming!
In the kitchen?
Hey, who’s your father?
My father is Raghava, chief cook
A cook’s son? Low-class fellow!
Get lost from here!
Ok, so what do you suggest we do now?
Revenge
He’s in wedding formal
What if we throw ink on it?
Good idea!
Hello..
I’ll come
Come, come!
Kishan!
Reena? What are you doing here?
For messages and massages, you want me
But for marriage, you want her?
You cheat!
Calm down! Please listen to me
I’m least interested in this marriage
But I agreed to marry the central minister’s daughter
only for my father’s political growth
Reena, only the marriage is with her
All the rest is with you
I hope you’re not cheating me...
No baby, I won’t. Trust me
Kishan!
Sir, what’s happened can’t be undone
Let the marriage get over,
I’ll talk to him
People often say it’s the ones without shame
who enter politics
But you! You lack even humanity!
Please listen to me...
- Shut up!
You wanted to spoil my daughter’s life
for your political career, isn’t it?
You just wait and watch what I’ll do now!
I think Lord Ram who I pray to descended in your form to
save me
Thank you dear boy
Dear boy, where are your parents?
I don’t have a mother. Only my father
Take this. Please buy a gift for the little boy
No ma’am
It is a woman who bears a child
in her womb for 9 months
She is far superior than
the goddess worshipped in a temple
If my son has managed to help a woman,
there can be no bigger gift than that
Jai Ram Ji Ki
Thank you!
Let’s go my dear
Who am I? Who am I?
I am the lord of the four worlds,
the ten-headed Ravana!
I am omni potent, independent...independence?
independence?
Happy independence day!
What nonsense are you blabbering?
Why aren’t you saying other lines?
It’s not easy to say mythological dialogues
Why sir? Why did you bring me here?
What wrong have I done?
For the damage that you both have done,
be happy I haven’t killed you!
And you want to know the reason!!
Hey you, make a video call
Ok sir
Tell me brother
What should I do with this fellow?
Sir, please ask him not to harm my son...
Until I instruct him,
he will not harm your son
Don’t worry!
But I’m wondering if we should kill you first
and then kill him
Or, if we should kill your son in front of you
and then finish you off
Sir, I beg of you
Kill me if you want,
but please don’t harm my son
If you want us to,
my son and I will leave this town.
Ok, I will spare both your son and you.
But on one condition
Ok sir
The condition is that you should utter
all of Ravana’s dialogues without stammering
If you do, I’ll spare your son
If you stop between lines,
you’ll face the consequences
Take,
start now
I am the lord of the fffour worlds...
Tell!
Go on, you stammer head!
I will, sir
I am the lord of the four worlds,
the powerful ten-headed Ravana...
One more chance, sir...
I am the lord of the four worlds,
the powerful ten-headed Ravana who is ooomniii...
Say it! Say it you stammer head!
Say it! Say it you stammer head!
Say it!
Get up!
I think this Anjaneya’s story is finished
Call up and ask them to finish off
that small fellow, too
Ok sir
What happened to the light!!
Tell me brother, shall I finish him off?
What shall I do, tell me...
You, speak up!
Why aren’t you talking?
What happened? Tell!
Who is it?
It’s me! The lord of the four worlds,
the powerful ten-headed Ravana!
The omni potent and omni present Ravana!
Who is this guy!!!
Who is it?
Who are you?
I am the lord of the four worlds,
the powerful ten-headed Ravana!
I am the omni potent and omni present Ravana!
I am the all mighty
who can destroy all the four worlds,
the master of all the powerful forces
that command the universe
the braveheart, the lion-hearted
most powerful Ravana!
The most powerful one! Powerful Ravana!
Powerful Ravana!
No! Please no!
So did you take revenge
on those who hurt you yesterday?
I’m sure you didn’t
You’d have happily let them go scot free
It’s ok,
let me feed you
Boss, why all this?
You have to go to school tomorrow
Please go to sleep
Boss, both of us don’t have mothers
But not one day did I feel the absence of a mother
So I should look after you the same way, right?
Please eat
There's been an attack on
Ex Minister Balram Tripathi and his group, sir.
Over 30 bodies have been found
Balram Tripathi was shifted to the hospital,
but he was declared dead on arrival, sir
Any clues or eye witness?
- No sir
Suraj, make a list of his arch rivals in the city
Sir, he has many such rivals here, sir
Looks like over 100 people attacked them sir
Which is why everyone's dead
Check the footage on all the CCTV's
We might get something
Ok sir
Did you find any information on Kishan Tripathi?
Where is he?
Sir, despite knowing everything about you,
I made a huge mistake!
I'll not repeat this again.
Please don't harm me. Forgive me
please!
Just this once!
Which colour will look nice on the flag
that graces my palace, Bhandary?
Chief...
I said which colour will look nice, Bhandary!
Red
Red will look nice, chief!
You're right, Bhandary
Chief...
Hey, Kishan.
I felt really sad on hearing the news of your father
Who is that who dared kill the tiger of UP!
Tell me if he's a local don,
I'll chop him to pieces right here!
If he's an international don,
I'll hunt him down and murder him!
He's neither, chief.
He's a mere cook
What?? A cook??
You can't dismiss him off as a mere cook
Even the mere mention of him makes me shiver!
It's enough to make me sweat!
Remember you're not standing
on ordinary ground to get scared
You are standing in Sarkar's fort
My boys will handle him
Where can we find him?
We thought our son-in-law will come
to Karnataka for the sake of my daughter
But now, Karnataka itself has travelled
to Lucknow for our son-in-law!
C'mon uncle! You're a retired police commissioner,
so you'll be well aware of the demands of our job
I can understand
Hey Madan,
Hey Madan, there's such a stark difference
in the death ceremonies
that are done back home and here, isn't it?
After all, it's a death ceremony.
What do you mean there's a huge difference
between back home and here? Nonsense!
You think people here keep
a cake instead of incense sticks??
Mind your own business! I'm talking to you!
Damn, nobody has the patience to listen to me!
Hey Bhootayya! Where's Raghava?
Jai Ram Ji Ki
- Jai Ram Ji Ki, son
The salt is not overdone, right?
Cylinder.
Chief, the men you've sent sure look like demons
But him? He looks like the monster who's going to finish
them all!
Even bad luck thinks twice to strike me
And here we're talking about a measly cook!
Don't you have any sense?
If you come in my path,
I'm someone who will hunt you down
and conduct your death ceremony
And you've come searching for me
to the place where death ceremonies are done
Got it?
- Sir
What's up son-in-law? Busy with investigation
even during celebration time?
Not at all uncle
It's a high-profile case,
so there's pressure
from the commissioner's office
Anyway Suraj...
Meet my father-in-law, Satyadev Alva,
Retired Commissioner of Police
I'll take your leave now, sir. Bye
Suraj... Can I see the picture?
Sure sir
This man here....?
- Suspect photo
An Ex MLA was murdered recently
We spotted him in the CCTV footage
when we went to the spot for investigations
As per initial information, he's a cook
His wife is no more. He has a son
Absolutely no criminal activities
Oh! His name?
- Raghava
Oh. And he has a son?
- Can I see him?
This is his son, sir
His name?
- Arjun, sir
What happened, uncle?
Something is fishy!
Can I get a sketch pen?
Hello, brother....
Why isn't anyone answering the phone?
How can they? He's killed them all!
I'm the only one left
What nonsense are you talking!!
Looks like I'm dying, too
Chief, didn't I warn you
that it's not easy to kill him?
It's me you're talking about!
I already have Plan B in place
John!
Target in sight
He's walking alone.
But if he has to come within firing range,
he has to come a further 80 mtrs
Then I can get a clear shot
Superb my boy!
A mere cook is finishing off so many people!
So before he's finished off with, I have to see him!
Who is he? Show me the phone.
C'mon show me!
Give it!
Hey! Connect it to the TV!
Hey! Has he seen you yet?
No, but I can see him
The shoot him before he sees you!
If not, I will only see you in a photo after this!
Shoot him!
He has to come a further 50 mtrs to be shot at
40 mtrs...
30 mtrs...
20 mtrs...
10 mtrs...
Target fixed!
Shoot him!
Oh damn!
What happened??
He was within my range all this while!
He's not within anyone's range, boy!
His range can't be summed in words!
If he's escaped from your range,
that means you're within his range now!
Escape right now!
Chief! Why are you getting so tensed?
Do you know Raghava?
He is not Raghava!
Raghava is the name of that boy's father
Then who is he?
The man who killed that boy's father,
Roberrt!
Roberrt!
Brother, please don't...
Laddu!
Boss,
this place has amazing guns.
lease buy me one
Please, no guns my dear boy
I'll buy you a drum, you can play that
Not fair!
Hey you, load everything into the vehicle!
We work for Nana, not you
This port comes under Nana's limits
You're not welcome here
My father had two heroines
And I don't say it's wrong
But do you know what wrong he committed?
Either he should've given birth to Nana or me
Kept two cradles, rocked it, and went away!
Even though our blood is the same
the temperature at which
they boil will be different, right?
Hey! What happening?
I hope you know who you have to face
even if you touch Nana
I do
That's exactly why I am going to "touch" Nana!
This time, it's not rowdies who I have hired to
to kill Nana, but demons!
Go tell Nana this
And also that sidekick of Nana
The vehicle will soon be in my limits
If he has the guts, ask him to touch me!
Dad, Sarkar has attacked the boat yard
and taken away all our loot!
It's not just taken the loot
he's taken away our pride, too
Dad, he doesn't fear you any more!
A man shivers only two occasions
One when he's feeling cold
The other when he's in fear
God makes people shiver in cold
once every season
But he's given me the responsibility
of making them shiver in fear
And we should make them do that ever so often
That's when there's a balance in nature
Even I'll send 200 rowdies!
He's sending 100 rowdies
not because we have 200 of them
It's only for him
There aren't any rowdies there
Just him. He can't do anything to us.
For someone who cuts halal meat,
he cares two hoots about those
who pluck feathers off the chicken!
He is enough for them all.
I asked you all to finish Roberrt
and you've tied up these men instead!
Who are they?
We searched for Roberrt everywhere
We didn't find him
But he has to come to save his friends here!
We'll show him dying on a live video!
Who the hell are you?
Raghav,
Roberrt's friend
If you've come here, where's he?
Did he run away in fear!!
Roberrt never runs away out of fear
And he doesn't spare anyone
who comes to scare him
Really? Where's he?
He's already here
What! Where's he?
You're sweating despite a weapon in hand
He's in that fear
that's causing you to sweat! Roberrt!
Kill him!
Let the army set sail on ships
Let the lightning and thunder accompany it
Let the army set sail on ships
Let the lightning and thunder accompany it
Without twirling the moustache,
the snobbery will be set aside
The pride shall also be kept away
If machismo takes over,
umpteen men will be crushed
He has the power to charge and is ever ready
I'm a blazing comet and can't be stopped
Come, Come, I'm ready
Come, Come, I'm ready
That god they went there on time
Our loot and pride have been restored intact.
And he won't stop at this
He will join hands with all our rivals
He'll hatch another plan tomorrow
Please be alert
We'd have finished Sarkar the other day
But you stopped us
In business, one should never act in haste
Yet,
one shouldn't be slow, too
Roberrt,
many are planning your downfall
Be careful
he only time I will be flat on the floor
is when I sleep
I didn't fear their action itself
Their plans mean nothing to me!
Write your last wish at home
Remember my blazing anger
Don't forget to walk with your head bowed down
Hold your breath hard
Boss has a slight mean streak
He's a rowdy with a rough touch
His hand is used to speed
Be careful with your words with him
A mind that is sans dirt is like a mirror
He's a lightning that can't be stopped
I'm a blazing comet and can't be stopped
Come, Come, I'm ready
Come, Come, I'm ready
What's happening?
There's a gang war going on every day!
Are the criminals in this city really strong
or are the cops weak?
If nobody gives a complaint,
the cops are like toothless tigers, sir
What do you mean?
There are two gangs in this city
-- Nana and Sarkar's
They can't stand each other.
One good thing is they don't trouble the public
So no complaint has been registered
against them so far
What's even strange is that
Nana and Sarkar are blood brothers
They were even working together
Nana adopted two orphans, Roberrt and Raghava
and groomed them for the trade
Nana who was a main player
until Roberrt entered the field
now became a mere extra
Nana couldn't tolerate it,
built his own gang and
became an enemy to his own brother
Since then, they've been at loggerheads with each other
You mentioned about Roberrt and Raghava...
They're not here yet, sir
The kites that flutter in the sky,
sometimes assume
that the sky itself is theirs
Once the breeze dies down,
they all fall limp to the ground
and I've seen many such kites!
I'm not aware of your chemistry
with the previous commissioner
But you should be aware
of my history with old gangs
Sir, it's better you come to the matter straight away
Even I don't have the time
to make conversation with lowly creatures
Till today, there hasn't been
a single complaint against you all
Until the time a complaint is registered,
the match is yours
Even if a single complaint is registered
I'll finish you all
Sir, we're well within our limits
But him?
He's into rowdyism with the help of Roberrt!
This Roberrt was a tiny sapling
when he entered the trade
But because we let him be,
he's become the tree
that stands like a compound between two brothers
And he grew up so easily!
Nobody's growth is that easy, Sarkar
When it's a sapling,
it has to escape from being destroyed
It has to endure gusty wind
It has to stay alive in the absence of rain
Even if it's felled many times
a tree has to be capable enough to grow again
That's when a sapling grows into a giant tree
Just accept all your wrongdoings
and surrender to the police
Build a better future
Are you thinking about our future?
Or do you want to better your future
by encountering us
and getting an award/promotion for it?
A brick factory owner may carve his initials
in large letter on his bricks
But it will all get buried in the process of plastering
This field is like that, too.
So come to an understanding without any further fights
Your future will be better
Our future will definitely be bright, sir
Having grown up with marks on our faces
it's not a difficult task to put a mark
on people's fingers during elections
That's the time when the siren of your jeep
will become the horn of our cars
Doctor! Doctor!
Excuse me!
Are you the patient?
Are you the patient?
Ma'am, I am the patient!
Let me examine you
His head is injured and is bleeding
Put 10 stitches for him
10 stitches? No way
This is a minor injury
Ma'am, you're confused!
It's not minor. It's a deep wound
I don't care if it's minor or deep
But 10 stitches are a must!
Didn't I tell you it's a minor one?
I can put a maximum of five stitches
See if you can put stitches now?
Raghu
Nurse! You made a mistake
So what he did was right?
Yes dear, what he did was definitely right
And you are?
His wife
This is my daughter
I had given her money to pay the fees
and gone to work
But this idiot
snatched the money from my daughter,
beat her up saying why should girls go to school
and has now come home drunk!
Since she got five stitches,
these good samaritans beat him up
and brought him here to get 10 stitches
Nurse, let me tell you something.
Don't be offended, please
The first victim to the disease called anger
is the one who gets angry
(Humming a tune)
Hi gays!!
You idiot! That's not gays. It's guys!
And what's wrong if I do say gays?
Why do you look down upon them?
Even girls are happy and gay isn't it?
There's gaiety even in victory
In fact, every body should be happy and gay!
A husband and wife
should also be happy and gay
Being gay is good!
Oh god, we're sorry dude!
Leave us alone now!
Hi Boss!
How come you've closed the hotel
this early, Bobby?
Come evening, everyone is off to down a 90
Who will come to drink tea?
Also, even when the whole town
looks at me strangely,
you're the only one
who treats me with respect
I don't feel at peace
if I don't see you once a day
Ah! Partying hard, huh?
It's Raghava's "feeling party"
Hey Raghava, you've started off alone, huh?
Boss, we usually give blows on other's heads
But a mere girl has slapped me and that hurts!
She must've been aiming for your head
but since she's short, she ended up slapping you
Forget it now!
Forget it?
That too without revenge? No way!
The nurse who injects everyone
will be spared only after I inject her!
Raghava, men are like rocks,
women are like flowers
The rock is worshipped with flowers,
but never the other way round
I don't care
I won't spare her
Hey, I'm coming!
Raghava!
Is this the time to come home?
Sorry, I'm late!
You've drunk and come home?
No, I came home walking
Yes, I can see that!
No more drinking, that's it!
Ok, understand?
- Understood
Understood what?
That I shouldn't come home drunk
That I can drink after going from here!
You idiot!
Sorry, I slapped without knowing the background,
this noon. Did it hurt?
No, I got scared
Scared? Why?
Because my gang of devils was with me
I was scared they'll smell something fishy
Raghava, what happened?
But those fools didn't realise
that something's on between us!
Johnny, Johnny!
Yes Boss!
Eating sugar?
No boss!
Telling lies?
Yes boss!
Open your mouth!
Boss!
Raghava, you'd be with us 24 hrs
When did this happen!
Boss...that...
You are a liar!
You tell
He'd often give the excuse of going to the temple,
that's when
Boss, even I have a doubt
Ask!
Hey Tanu, I like your top.
Where did you buy it?
Idiot!
Raghava, I’m getting really scared!
Yeah right!
Scared?
The fear that you didn’t have when this lover boy would come
to your house at mid night,
you’re feeling now??
Boss!
- Shut up!
I am asking you. Not you!
You tell...
We love each other a lot
Stand up.
The girl seems very positive
That’s exactly why I fell in love with her
You falling in love with her is not important.
You ensuring that she never falls down in life
is what’s more important
My father is very strict.
Even if there’s a love marriage scene on TV,
he switches it off.
Which is why I’m scared if he’ll accept our love
If we make up our mind,
we can make even god accept it.
So your dad is no big deal
Boys!
Who’s that in the house? Come out!
Boss, we haven’t come to finish off our enemies.
We’ve come to build a new relationship.
Ok wait!
Aunty......Aunty...
Uncle...Uncle...
Who is that?
Mom, the waiter from the hotel is here.
Come fast!
Waiter?
Boss, can I try once?
Aunty! Aunty!
Who is that?
Hello!
Dear...the band players have come inside our home.
Come fast!
What! Band player?
I’m much better than you
What do the band players want?
Hello sir
Hello
Hello sir
My name is...
Yes, I know.
Who doesn’t know you in this town?
Please sit
Boys!
Ok
Boss, maintain a soft attitude
Sorry!
Why are you still standing?
Please sit
It’s ok, tell me.
What brings you here?
This is Raghava.
Before you can count 100,
he’d have beaten up a 100 people.
He’s that strong.
But he’s feeling shy to talk in front of you.
Ask why?
Please ask!
Why?
Because you will have to give your girl and gun...
Boss,
not gun!
Sorry, not gun, the apple of your eye!
So he’s feeling shy!
Sir, my friend and your daughter are wedded mentally.
If you approve, we’ll get them married physically,
that’s all that remains.
What do you have to say?
Oh god! Why does she need my permission?
If they love each other, then it’s sealed.
Go ahead!
Sir! How come you agreed to it so soon?
What else can I do?
You’ll are rowdies.
If I don’t agree,
you will force me to agree.
If it were anyone else in your place,
I’d have slippered them!
Dad! He’s a really nice guy!
You shut up!
Since you were a small girl, I’m the one
who’s catered to all your likes and dislikes.
So I have every right to choose who you will marry!
If you marry this fellow,
you will not live in peace even for a day!
We don’t know when he’ll die
and you want to marry him!
Tell me!
Oh god!
If I press this trigger,
next second you’ll be dead, too!
Only the evil die, so the good will go on forever is it?
Once you’re born on earth, your fate is sealed.
Struggle in your life.
Rest in peace only in death.
Roberrt....
Listen
If you have to become a hero in someone’s life,
you have to become a villain in someone else’s life.
Now you decide
whether you want to become a villain
in your father’s life or...
your lover’s life
What happened Bobby?
He went to commit suicide.
These boys saw him at the right time
and brought him back!
What happened Bobby!!
Hi!
- Hi!
(Bobby hums a popular Kannada song)
You’re the one who fetches tea for the workers.
Shut your trap and give me tea!
Why are you always chatting with girls?
Oh, I’m not chatting with them, sir.
We are all bus mates.
When you travel by bus,
do you sit in the gents seat or ladies?
I take an empty seat
You’re a lady, so better to sit in the ladies seat
Henceforth, I will sit next to your sister
in the ladies seat, ok?
Hey, show us that you are worthy enough
to sit next to my sister!
Let me go! Give it back to me!
Hey guys, look!
So you’ve become brave enough
to come and stand in front of us??
Bravery doesn’t come
owing to who is in front of us.
It stems from who stands behind us.
Who is standing behind you man?
Who is that?
Some great man?
Who wanted to disrobe him
and check if he’s a man or woman?
It’s us!
But even in the end, we couldn’t make out
if he was a man or woman!
He had covered himself with his hands!
That’s exactly why I’ve come!
We have class on the outside.
If we get down to war, we’re completely mass
You guys wait, I’ll be back
Show him!
If any of you still have doubts,
come and confirm
When you talk about honour,
it’s no different for women or men.
The right to life that you and I have,
these folk have the same right
to lead a dignified life.
Male pride is not on dishonouring someone
and getting thrills out of it.
A real man is one who protects someone’s dignity even if it
is at the cost of his own life.
Boss
You wastrel,
if you are mass, then
We should find a nice girl
and get Roberrt married!
What?? Find a match for Roberrt?
He’s not interested in marriage
Please give me something, please!
Here, take this
Hey, please wait!
Yes?
What’s the name of the baby?
Name??
Don’t you know the name of your own child?
Why are you asking me all this?
Give the baby to me
Why should I? It’s mine! I won’t!
Wait! One minute!
What happened?
That baby is not her’s!
I delivered that baby
and I remember its face very well.
That was my first ever delivery!
I’m sure this baby is the same one, Raghav!
Brother, nobody is willing to give me money
once they see this baby!
If you look as cute as Shah Rukh Khan’s third son,
who will give you money, huh?
Bring that heated bar!
If I scar him with it,
I’m sure they’ll all give him money!
Who are you man?
Look like you’ve come straight from the jungle.
What are you doing here?
Where did you find this baby?
I have a plant on which children grow.
I pluck them and put them in heaps here.
Get lost man!
Tell us!
Raghava, these are mere puppets.
The main puppeteer is someone else.
Who is that? Tell us!
Nana’s son Cherry!
Show me what’s in your hand, baby!!
You’re praying?
Even I’ve been trying since childhood.
But I haven’t seen god or the devil!
Ok baby, carry on.
Let me also see which god comes to help you!
Hey Roberrt, Raghav, come!
Whether a cop can sense
the scent of a robber or not,
but a robber can definitely sense
the scent of another robber!
Look at my kingdom!
Sorry, you’re unable to figure it out.
Come, come, I’ll explain.
We export the ones here to Dubai, Syria, all over.
Everyone here is under 12 years.
We pluck their eyes out
and leave them to go begging.
Good earnings.
We also auction them online.
That is labour!
Marriage!
There’s so many other things.
Do you know how much I earn from this?
Hundreds of crores!
Cherry, we’re telling you one thing straight.
Let go of these kids.
No way!
These kids have already been sold online!
Hey, do you understand the pain of their parents??
Forget the parents!
Do you realise what a pain
it is to smuggle them out of the hospital?
Don’t come in the way and waste my time.
If you like a girl, feel free to take her!
Roberrt..
Nana, Cherry...
I got to know of the matter.
I’ll talk to him.
You guys leave
What about the kids?
I’ll handle it.
You guys leave!
What is my father saying?
Did he ask you all to silently leave the place?
I knew it.
Will he keep quiet if you hit his son for the sake of
somebody else’s kids?
Roberrt!
He speaks like a moron,
you guys don’t worry.
Leave now
Remember that you’re orphans.
You won’t understand these sentiments.
Leave!
Roberrt! It takes just a second to pull the trigger.
Don’t get disturbed. Leave from there!
Boss!
Brother,
look here!
They’ve plucked his eyes out.
And haven’t given anything to eat since yesterday.
They beat us a lot!
Please send us back to our parents
Boss, you always keep telling us
that it’s ok to earn a living through any means.
But that we shouldn’t break someone’s head
He’s doing both!
Brother!
It’s ok if you don’t kill him,
but please kill us!
It’s better to die once for all
than do so every day in this rotting hell!
No Roberrt,
No
Roberrt
Please don’t do anything to me!
Hey! Did you see that?
Both your desires were fulfilled at the same time!
I just saw god and you just saw the devil!
Brother, please don’t spare him!
No, no!
Roberrt
Roberrt, no. Please listen to me!
Roberrt, leave from there now!
Roberrt please!
Roberrt!
Listen to me! Roberrt!
Roberrt!
Just because you have a golden sword,
you can't twirl your moustache with it
It will cut your moustache and your nose, too
Do you know why
there's a witness box in the court?
So that even the wrongdoer gets a platform
Tender age. Small mistake
He'd have probably corrected himself
If he were properly advised
We are all making a mistake
There's no distinction of big or small in it
A mistake is a mistake
And it has to be duly punished
In our field, we can't be sentimental
No matter who it is
Sweety!!!
Darling, please come here
What is it?
Please take him
Com here baby
Please make him pee
All heavyweights will be coming for the party
and you want me to make him pee
in front of them?
Bobby!
- Coming!
Take him and make him pee
It's not enough if you're a good husband
A man must also be a good father
You'll know what I mean
if I fall sick for a few days
What is this? Trouble in paradise?
A husband and wife should be like
water and a quarter
It shouldn't become like water and a matter!
Sorry! Grammar mistake!
Roberrt! How nicely you explained everything!
Wow! Such brilliant actors you both!
I'm just keen to know one thing
Why do you men always give preference
to friendship than your wives?
He is the father who admonishes and advices us
He is the mother who wipes our tears when in pain
He is the teacher who teaches us the lessons of life
He is closer to us than a life partner
It is a bond that supersedes even blood relation
He goes beyond caste and creed
A true friend is one who shows more love
to us than everyone
A brother from another mother
O my friend
I will lay down my life for you,
you mean more than life itself
I will be with you throughout my life
Your enemy is my enemy, too
I will put up a fight on behalf of you
You are my best friend
Our love has no dead end
Even God will not be with us always
Which is why he has given friends like you
A true friend is one who comes
and encourages you even when he's in pain
A brother from another mother
We share the highs and lows of life
and are always together
Even time cannot stop us
You are hope, trust and faith
and victory when with us
No one can separate us
Our's is one ship
This bond is called friendship
One word from you is enough to melt our hearts
If you go away from us, our hearts will break
The one who comes first in times of hardship,
you are a true friend
A brother from another mother
Happy birthday to you
Open your mouth baby....
Open your mouth baby....
Wow! Look here baby!
Sir! Move, move it!
Roberrt...
Is Nana safe?
Yes, he is
Laddu!!
I am standing in front of you.
And you standing in front of me.
Together, I'll be with you like this.
You are my soul.
My life is dedicated to you.
Be my breath like this.
Be my breath like this.
With my breath.
May the joy of the world be in this hand,
Till the end.
I embrace you like a baby forever.
I feel like I've a got a new present.
May this process love be like this forever.
It takes guts for even a criminal to surrender
to the cops
I appreciate your decision
I took this decision purely on a personal note
This is not to cause trouble
to Roberrt, Nana or my friends
I lost my wife whom I loved dearly
I don't want to lose my son, too
My son's future is very important to me
Do you know why temples, schools, jails,
Bhagavad Geetha, Quran and the Bible exist on earth?
To teach good values to man
To make him a good human
Man is born evil
The process of making him a better man
is what happens on this earth
Don't think of going to jail as punishment.
Think of it as a lesson
Once you come out, start a new life.
Raghava, a prominent member of underworld don Nana,
has voluntarily surrendered to the cops
He has also given them valuable information
on some of the illegal activities pursued by the gang.
It'd not have been a problem
if he had merely surrendered
But he's now become a police informer
I never thought Raghava would do this to us, Nana
I wish he had at least told me
about surrendering himself
He made mistake
Raghava is no different from my son
That day, I killed my own son to save those kids
And today, what should I do
to save all my friends, Roberrt?
Why have you brought me here, sir?
We can't take you to court right now, Raghava?
Have you planned an encounter, sir?
Very clever!
If I don't kill you,
they will get contract killers to finish you off
But I do the same thing,
I'll get 2 crores
Can I know who is giving you the two crores?
The same man that you were working for,
Nana
As long as Roberrt is there,
I'm sure all this wouldn't happen!
Who knows! Roberrt himself would've been involved
Even they'd have feared that
Raghava may take their names in court
The amount has been transferred.
Now the time has come to transfer you
News comes in that Raghava,
a member of underworld don Nana,
has escaped after killing the cop
who was on duty with him
A misunderstanding can occur between a couple
But not between gangsters, Roberrt
Lives will be lost
Just because we have two ears,
we don't hear two different things
But one mouth can say a hundred different things
Which is why some truth
will never make their way to anyone
This is a game played by Sarkar
Don't worry, Nana.
I'll make Raghava understand matters
What are you up to Raghava?
Revenge!
On whom?
The one who bribed the ACP to finish me off
Nana
This is a game played by Sarkar
I'm no fool to not realise
who's playing a game or a double game with me!
Please don't speak rubbish without knowing the truth
I want to hear the truth from you first
You who used to stand behind me
whenever I held a gun
is standing in front of me today. Why?
What kills man faster than cyanide
are negative thoughts
At this point, everyone will look like rivals to you
What hurts more than a 100 people
putting a knife into your chest is
that of a friend stabbing you in the back, Roberrt!
Despite knowing that your accomplices will be in trouble
it is you who gave information to the cops
And you're talking about friendship?
Do you know how many gang members lost their lives
because of this mistake of yours?
The ones who died were not freedom fighters
They are hardcore criminals who had
their expiry date written on the birth certificate!
What mistake had my wife committed?
Owing to our crimes, she lost her life!
If I make the same mistake again,
I'll lose my son tomorrow!
And I won't allow that
Nor will I spare anyone who comes in the way
I'll slit them in half!
I've learnt to slice and dice much before you!
Ah, such valuable information!
The ACP was right
You were also involved
in giving the contract to kill me
If I wanted to kill you,
why will I go to the ACP?
If the elephant wants to kill a tiger,
it will not approach a fox.
It will do the job on its own
Roberrt, friendship means nothing to me
if it comes in the way of me taking revenge
And if someone comes in the way of my principles,
I'll forget that he was a friend
No matter how deep the friendship
between a gun and a bullet,
if the trigger is pulled, they have to separate
The bullet surely fires from the gun when
friendship between a gun and bullet is triggered.
But it only hits the target at which the gun aimed at
The bullet will not return
just because it's separated from the gun
Raghava!
You both come to me
after getting together and killing my son?
And you want me to console you
and keep quiet?
I was operating the child trafficking trade
through my son
The day he died,
I decided that I'd finish off you two
Even at the birthday party,
the attack was supposed to be on you
Just miss!
We brothers are like the two doors to a single gate
We stay separate from the ones
who walk in between, that's all.
But blood is the lock that will unite us again
This siege, encounter
and ACP is a game played by us
I'm old, so did you mistake me
to be a senior citizen?
Brother, they killed our Cherry.
Don't spare them for long!
Kill them!
The killing has to always be memorable.
You were always ready to lay down your life
for your friend isn't it?
Now with the soft hands of your friend, we shall....
Roberrt, hold it!
What are your looking at? Shoot him!
What is this Roberrt?
Shooting him in the knee?
Are you a constable?
You're a shooter!
Not in the knee, right into his chest!
Here, take it. Shoot at his chest!
Roberrt, the heart is not in the right, but the left
Chief, shall I let go of this child?
Yes, When he grows up, he'll kill us both!
Then what should I do?
The lord has given us the job to feed the fishes.
We're blessed!
Put them into the container along with this child
and throw them into the sea!
And also spread the news that
Roberrt has killed Raghava and escaped from this town
Hey Raghava!
Look here!
Raghava!
Boss Laddu?
Get up! Laddu is safe!
I won't live Boss!
Raghava, you have to live
at least for the sake of the child
But you're there Boss.
You're the one who looked after me like a parent.
Henceforth you'll be this child's father and mother. Boss!
Raghava, no harm will come to you, come!
Promise me one thing
Please take this child
and go somewhere far away, please!
Please listen to me Raghava!
Hey Raghava!
In order to stick to the promise made to his friend,
even though he can win a hundred fights,
he lives like a monk today, our Roberrt.
He stammers so that the child doesn't feel
ashamed about his stammering.
So you think he'll spare anyone
who comes to harm the child?
I beg of you,
please keep this information to yourself
Boss what are you doing here?
Come and have breakfast?
I ate already. My mother fed me
Mother? Who is that?
Boss, this not your mother.
She is Amrutha ma'am
I know. But you usually stammer
at the first word, right?
ut when you utter her name,
you stammer at the last word.
So obviously, some letters go missing from Amrutha
and it becomes Amma!
If the word mother which you hadn't mentioned
all these days is now being said,
then I must've fallen short in doing my duty
No Boss
I will mend my ways.
Come, you're getting late for school
Why are you committing a mistake despite knowing it?
Is it right to fall in love with him
in spite of knowing him and his situation?
Babu, if Raghava was an ordinary man like the rest,
I'd not have bothered.
But he's a picture of patience.
A man who lives up to his word.
A man filled with love.
A man who is like fire when angered
A man who is filled with so many virtues
like the lord himself,
so how can I not love him?
I felt sad
Why??
We got you drunk
Why??
You didn't give me enough time
Why??
You didn't come close to me
Why??
I liked you because of your style
I commented because I loved it
I subscribed because I liked your character
Baby, the dance floor is ready
Baby, the dance floor is ready
Do the break dance
I felt sad
Why??
We got you drunk
Why??
These are bad times
Why??
Everything happens over the phone
Why??
We could've met in person
Why??
A mistake has occurred
Why??
You are sweet
Meet me
Once you met me
I felt like I was high on vodka & wine
Get on my express train
Baby, the dance floor is ready
Do the break dance
I'm unable to sleep at night
Why??
I sleep really late
Why??
Please don't pick a fight with me
Why??
Please become one by two
Why??
You are cute
So hug me tight
My mind is now fixed on you
But I've forgotten the password
But the signals are rather strong
Baby, the dance floor is ready
Do the break dance
Looks fine. Jai Ram Ji Ki
Jai Ram Ji Ki
Tell me Babu
Brother, apparently the food that we catered
to a birthday party last night
has causes food poisoning.
The cops have taken our owner for enquiry.
Ok, I'll be there
- Ok
Hello?
I'm Arjun's teacher from Lucknow Public School.
He hasn't come to school today?
What??
I dropped him outside school just a while ago!
If he's not to be seen now,
what does that mean!
Calm down! I'll inform the cops
No sir.
But can you do me a favour?
Namaste ma'am.
- Namaste
This is Arjun's father speaking
I heard Raju hasn't gone to school.
Even Arjun is not to be seen.
Has he come to your house?
No, we are out of station
This is Arjun's father speaking
Yes, tell me
Is Bunty home?
Bunty in unwell. We're in the hospital
Hello Raghava, the cops have taken daddy
I know, ma'am
They're saying they'll file a case
You don't get worried, ma'am.
I'll come there
Tell me Babu
Boss, the cops had come home in search of you
in connection with the Tripathi murder case.
Please be careful
Laddu!
Hey, what are you doing?
Sorry!
Come son
Roberrt
Your silence speaks volumes about who I am.
I will come to the matter straight away.
Our's is a sort of blood relation, Roberrt.
You shed my son's blood.
And I shed the blood of your friend.
To put an end to this blood relation,
I have come all the way from Mangaluru
and am playing games with Raghava's son
whom you claim as your own!
On the other hand,
they have arrested your catering owner over a case.
The cops are searching for you
owing to the Tripathi murder case.
Now where will you go?
Whom will you save?
Is your blood boiling, Roberrt?
Not much you can do.
You're like the Pandavas who are in exile
in the forest sans their weapons.
If you unmask yourself, it's back to exile again.
What will you do?
If you assume that those in exile are Pandavas
who've forsaken their weapons,
then you're mistaken, Nana!
Rama finished off Ravana while he was in exile, too.
This hand knows to bow down in front of Shabari
and win over a fight with Ravana, too.
Think and let me know.
Do you want to live like Shabari
or die like Ravana,
The countdown starts
Boss
see your friend has destroyed my horse.
I will definitely seek revenge for this.
Cool it dear one.
You're upset for me killing your horse.
Next I will kill your elephant.
Laddu, can I tell you a story?
Which one, uncle?
The one in which Duryodhana kills Karna
But aren't they both best friends?
Yes, indeed!
But in this story, Duryodhana kills Karna,
leaves Hastinapura, comes to Ayodhya
and lives in disguise as Anjaneya
It's strange, uncle
Yes, it's strange
But this tale is not in Ramayana
or Mahabharata
Only I know it.
Just in case Karna had a son
and if Duryodhana was in front of him,
what would he do?
He should seek revenge!
Go ahead, take revenge.
The story is not a strange one.
That Karna's son is you.
Duryodhana is this man here.
Brother, you're amazing.
You said you'd destroy the elephant
and check-mated him!
The story that he has been hiding
from the child so far,
you managed to tell him in a matter of seconds!
Poor fellow.
There's no way he's going to escape
this situation now.
Now what will you do, Roberrt?
Sir, who are you all?
And why are you going on addressing me Roberrt?
I'm not Roberrt, sir. I'm Raghava.
Laddu, how many times have I told you
that you shouldn't talk to strangers!
And you've bunked school, too!
Your teacher called and shouted at me!
Come let's go
Sir, you're confused.
I'm not the Roberrt you're searching for.
I'll take your leave now.
Laddu, say bye to your grandfathers.
Bye!
Hey, stop right there!
When we've come all the way
from Mangaluru to Lucknow by flight,
what makes you get away so easily?
Aren't you Roberrt?
Why do you doubt that so much, sir?
One minute,
See this. This is my Aadhar card.
This is my driving license.
I'm Raghava, sir
So you're not Roberrt?
I'm Raghava, sir
Really?
I know very well how to summon the Roberrt who hides inside
this Raghava!
Boss!
Don't hit him
Don't him
I beg of you sir
Please leave me
Laddu
Boss! What happened?
Why are you quiet even if they're hitting you so much?
Hit them back!
We shouldn't hit them back.
They've mistaken me for someone else.
Please let me go, sir
Laddu!
Take him and look him up in a room!
Sir please no
Open the door
You made a mistake, chief!
He was the one safeguarding your life all this while.
And you've locked him up!
Big mistake!
Open the door
Boss!
Please don't beat him up!
Sir I beg of you
Leave me sir
It's not me
Please don't beat him up!
Please leave me
Laddu
Sir please
Open the door
Please don't beat him up!
Leave him! Boss
Boss
Sir please don't beat me
Please leave me sir
Those useless Hollywood folk
give the Oscars to worthless people.
They should be giving it to this guy!
Hey you, go open that door!
Let that boy out, go!
Open the door
Hey Chotu, stay right there!
Don't move. And don't go near that door!
Why? Because you want to beat up my father??
No, no! Please don't move,
stay right there!
I won't leave you!
Open the door
Leave him
I thought I'll chase you and beat you to pulp.
But you don't even have the strength
to get up and run!
Do you need revenge at this age?
I may be old,
but the volcano that is within me, is still seething!
And it won't cool down even in a ten lifetimes!
Sometimes when the pot of sin is brimming,
even if there's no reservation in hell,
they get a ticket on tatkal.
Karma is such that
even when some folk don't seek revenge,
they get a job at the same ticket counter.
That is dharma.
The game of chess that you like so much
has the truth of life
Every pawn will get boxed after the game
This Robert became Raghav
by understanding that truth
Had I stood for revenge that day,
none of you would have been here.
The promise that I made to my friend,
made me spare your life.
But look at fate.
It has brought you back to me again.
But again, I will not break the promise
made to my friend.
God will punish you
Boss
Boss, are you okay?
Boss....where are they?
Apparently, they found the Roberrt
they were searching for
Damn, why couldn't they have found him earlier?
You'd have been spared from their blows
It's ok, boss.
I'm glad you are fine.
That's all that matters to me.
Come, let's go. It's time to go to the fair
You're the one who saved my life.
Is it that big a deal for me to call he cops
and talk to them?
Please ask for something big!
Don't feel shy. Ask
Today is the final day of Navarathri.
You're the one who usually sets Ravana on fire.
Yes
Just this one time, can you give my son
the chance to destroy Ravana?
He doesn't even know what to ask!
That's all you want? Ok!
Raghava...
Uncle, is this the guy you were talking about?
Harsha,
this isn't the Roberrt I've seen.
There's no necessity to once again hit the rock
that has now become a sculpture
Laddu, go ahead and destroy Ravana
