They are the ones who pray for hope,
embrace curses, and fight ever onward.
They are the magical girls.
The price we paid to obtain our miracles
was to take a destiny of battle upon our souls.
And this destiny ended in
the salvation of oblivion.
By disappearing from this world,
we could escape our fate of despair.
Someday, that final day will come.
As we wait for the Law of
the Cycle to lead us away,
we continue our unending battle.
In this irredeemable world, forever
repeating its tragedies and hatred,
I dreamt that I encountered
that familiar smile once again.
Bingo, Madoka!
All according to plan!
I dream of the morning
It's not time yet, it's not time yet
What color will the morning be?
It's not time yet, it's not time yet
The night is still only half-eaten
Where is the child who slumbers?
Now, good morning
to you, Nightmare!
And the bad dreams
will never come agai
Morning already?
Good morning, Kyubey.
Good morning, Dad!
Good morning, Madoka.
Is Mom up?
Tatsuya's waking her up right now.
Go help him, will you?
Okay!
Mommy! Mommy!
Morning! Morning!
Mommy! Mommy!
RISE AND SHINE!
So what's been
going on lately?
Hitomi's been having
a hard time.
She says her schedule never
matches up with Kyosuke's.
Though that'll be moe of a problem
once they start going on dates regularly.
But tell her, "Don't get discouraged,
don't obsess and don't give up!"
Here.
Ms. Saotome has suddenly started talking
about the end of the world in class.
I guess she's really
in the dumps right now.
Oh, boy. I'd better step in and set
her up on a blind date o sometging.
I wonder why Ms. Saotome
isn't more popular with men.
She has a lot of really
cute points.
She's always had overly
high standards for men.
For better or worse, she's just not willing
to compromise on them, I guess.
All right!
And also, a new student is transferring
into our class today.
At this time of year?
Isn't that unusual?
I wonder what they'll be like?
I hope we can become friends.
Safe!
There, eat it all up now, okay?
Okay!
More coffee, honey?
Better not.
All right! I'm off then.
Have a nice day!
Now then, you'd better hurry too, Madoka.
I'm heading out!
Have a nice day, sweetie!
Have nice daaaay!
Madoka Magica the Movie: Rebellion
Good morning!
You're late, Madoka!
Nice work last night.
I saw you walking home with a girl!
Were you able to get
some sleep afterwards?
More or less. But since I didn't have
time to do the reading for today,
I may be in trouble if
I get called on in class.
You're fine.
I didn't even bother doing my homework!
So I'm in way more trouble!
Madoka, you'll let me copy
your homework later, right?
Hey! Don't you mix Madoka up
in your underhanded ways!
It's only because you won't
let me see yours!
And you're the underhanded one,
sneaking off by yourself
to get a head start
on your homework!
I suggested we do our homework
together as soon as we got home!
It was your own fault for
going off and watching TV!
Hey, hey, come on, you two...
I knew it was too much to try to go to
school while being a magical girl!
We never have any time
to have fun!
Who said "having fun"
was part of the deal?
Class, just because the date of the apocalypse
foretold by the Mayan calendar has passed,
I don't want you
thinking we're safe.
No way! we're not.
This is only the beginning!
A solar or lunar eclipse will occur upon every high holy day
of a certain religion next year, for a total of six.
Isn't that scary?
It's quite ominous, isn't it?
Meaning that by 2050, our world
will undergo a certain event...
Which is what, Mr. Nakazawa?!
Um, well... I don't know
what you're talking about...
Now, that won't do.
In the country in question, it
seems 41% of the population
believes that the Second Coming of Christ
will occur within the next 40 years!
The seven trumpets of the Book of
Revelation may blow any minute!
Well, to be honest...
I think perhaps the ending of the
world may not be such a bad thing.
After all, I've had my fill of dealings
with men and love and so forth.
If I must carry on this way and have
my age rounded up to 40 from now on,
I'd rather everything just ended
at once, in one fell swoop.
Um... Ms. Saotome?
Ah, yes, yes,
come to think of it-
I need to introduce a new transfer
student to you all today!
She totally forgot, didn't she?
Come on in, Miss Akemi!
My name is Homura Akemi.
Pleased to meet you!
Miss Akemi has been in the hospital
for a while due to a heart condition.
Since it's been some time since she's been in
school, she may be a bit behind on a few things.
I want all of you
to help her out, okay?
HOMURA AKEMI
Yes, ma'am.
A Soul Gem?!
That girl, she's...
HOMURA AKEMI
You can sit at the open desk
beside Mr. Nakazawa.
You already knew, Mami?
I did, sorry.
I just thought it would
be fun to surprise you all.
I really should have introduced
myself last night.
Last night, when we were out
hunting the Nightmare,
you mean Mami wasn't the only one
waiting at the rendezvous point?
Yes, I had Homura
help me out as well.
Her power is amazing.
She can boost her strength several times
over by using multiple attacks.
I-I can only really fight in a support role.
I don't have any real attack power.
But you're obviously
pretty reliable.
Recently, we get nothing but the big-shot
Nightmares, so we could use some extra help.
Assuming your performance last night
wasn't a fluke or anything.
But yeah, I've got no
complaints either.
Then once again,
my name is Homura Akemi.
From here on, I will help you battle
the Nightmares of this town.
I look forward to
working with you!
Let's do our best together, Homura!
It's so beautiful...
Yes.
It's already been a month since
you transferred here, Homura.
It's odd, isn't it? It feels
like I've known you forever.
And yet, it also feels like
this month has flown by.
It'd be nice if the Nightmares stayed away tonight,
and everyone could get a good night's sleep.
It's strange,
but I get the sense
that I've been wanting to have a talk
with you like this for long time.
Which is odd, since talking
isn't a big deal.
And tomorrow, we'll see each
other again at school anyway.
True. But I feel the same way.
Like I've been waiting
so very long
to be able to spend time
together with you like this.
KYOSUKE KAMIJO
Hello?
Ah, hello, Kyosuke.
Are you free to talk right now?
Hi, Hitomi.
Sure, what's up?
I'm sorry for calling
so late at night.
Um...
Do you have any plans
for this Sunday?
I do, sorry.
I've got to use Sundays
for lessons as well,
since there's so little time
left before my next recital.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry our schedules just
never, ever seem to match.
There's no need to
apologize for that.
Seeing you work so hard for
your music is something
I really love about you!
Then I'll see you
at school tomorrow?
Yes. Have a good night.
Yes,
he really looks so strong and amazing
when he's working hard,
and I love him that way.
But...
...would it kill him to use some of
that effort for me once in a while?
I've had it!
I don't need Sundays anymore!
And his recital can just
disappear as well!
I know what I'd do.
I... I-
Cheese? Is this cheese?
Bebe, give me
that hairpin, please.
Hard...
A Night-Night Mare is here!
A Night-Night Mare is coming!
What? Again?
Turn into cheese!
Turn into cheese!
Oh dear...
Late nights are the
natural enemy of beauty.
Hey... Is that
Hitomi Shizuki's Nightmare?
Hitomi's really having
a hard time, isn't she?
No surprise, considering she made
Captain Oblivious her boyfriend.
That has a lot of added
significance coming from you!
Yeah, I guess? Maybe this means
I've gained some life experience?
Get serious, you two, or
you'll put yourselves in danger.
Right...
Where are Madoka and Homura?
Sorry for making you wait.
You guys are late!
Sorry, Sayaka.
Everyone's here! Everyone's here!
All right! Let's go, everyone!
Right!
Puella Magi Holy Quintet!
Madoka! Mami!
Okay!
Go for it, Homura!
Tiro Duet!!
Release!
I totally get how you feel,
but calm down, Hitomi!
The five Lillians!
Kyoko!
Latticework Barrier!
It's stopped moving!
Nicely done!
Now everyone, let's finish this!
Cake! Cake!
A round, round cake!
This round, round cake...
Who could it be?
Is the cake Sayaka?
No, not me!
I am the raspberry.
The round cake is red.
Is the cake Kyoko?
No, not me!
I am the apple.
The round cake loves Bebe.
Is the cake Mami?
CHEESE
No, not me!
I am the cheese.
The round cake goes round in circles.
Is the cake Homura?
N-No, not... me!
I-I... am the pumpkin!
T-The round cake is sweet.
Is the cake Madoka?
No, not me!
I am the melon.
When a melon breaks,
it creates a sweet dream.
But tonight's dream
is a bitter one.
Atop the plate
is the dream of the cat.
Round and plump.
Everyone eat up!
We did it!
It was a piece of cake
with our powers combined!
Now, now, we can't afford
to let our guards down.
There were a few moments when
I thought we were in trouble back there.
Aw, enough with your preaching.
Though if you were offering tea
and cake, I guess I wouldn't mind.
Hey now, Kyoko!
That's actually a good idea!
Guess there's no helping it.
Would you all like to
come over for a bit?
Yes!
C'mon, Sayakaaa!
Oh, right, I still have enough of that
chamomile tea for one more pot.
That was really delicious!
I've also just opened a new can
of Echinacea tea as well.
I don't like sour stuff, okay?
Your tastes are like a little kid's!
What was that?! You-
Give me cheese! Cheese!
I want cheese! Cheese!
All right, all right. I've got
to reward you too, Bebe.
Mascarpone!
Massscarpooone!
Homura? Is something wrong?
Oh, no, it's nothing.
I wonder if our battles...
have always been like this?
Hey!
Do you want a piece of
fried chicken, Homura?
Oh. Sure.
Thank you.
So? What did you want
to talk about?
Um... well...
Kyoko, have things felt
a little odd to you lately?
What do you mean
by "things"?
Well, I don't know exactly...
but everything, for some reason...
What are you trying to say?
Are you feeling okay?
The reason I decided to talk to you
before anyone else was because,
well, you're the one that
feels oddest to me.
Compared to the impression
of you I have inside me,
the person you are now just
seems completely different.
You don't seem like
the same person.
Hey, hold on.
What's your deal?
Are you actually trying
to pick a fight with me?
Kyoko, where are you
living right now?
I'm crashing at Sayaka's place.
I thought you already knew that.
How long have you been going
to Mitakihara Middle School?
I transferred in
before you did.
And when was that?
Let's see, it was last year in...
Seriously, when did I transfer in?
But why does it matter to you?
Where were you before
you moved to Mitakihara City?
A neighboring city, Kazamino.
It had become pretty
peaceful there,
so when Mami said things were rough
here, I came over to help out.
Have you gone back to visit
Kazamino City lately?
Nope. Don't really have
a reason to go back.
Kyoko, will you come with me
to Kazamino City right now?
To do what?
It will be enough
just to go there.
If it looks like the city you remember,
you'll have my apologies.
I'll know this was all
my own misunderstanding.
I still don't really get
what this is about.
but I don't think you're
pulling a fast one on me.
You're dead serious, aren't you?
Yes.
There's a tasty ramen shop
I used to go to back home.
Buy me dinner there.
Do that, and you
have a deal.
I will!
KAZAMINO STATION NORTH ENTRANCE
Once we reach the next stop,
we'll be in Kazamino City.
The next stop is
Mitakihara City, Third Street.
Please use this stop
for Shinonome Dental-
That's not right,
we're supposed
to turn left up here!
MITAKIHARA LOOP LINE
Did we get on
the wrong bus?
Definitely not.
I'm positive we got on the bus
bound for Kazamino Station.
Let's catch the next bus
and go back.
And make sure we're on
the right one this time.
This time there's no mistake.
KAZAMINO STATION NORTH ENTRANCE
The next stop is Mitakihara City,
Second Street.
Please use this stop for Mitakihara
Municipal Elementary School.
Stop requested.
Hold on now!
Hey, you!
Damn...
MITAKIHARA LOOP LINE
What the helI is going on?
This time, we'Il go on foot.
If we walk back to that crossroads
and take the left fork,
we should reach
Kazamino City, right?
Yeah...
Hey...
Was it really this far
to that crossroads?
No. It's very odd that we
haven't reached it by now.
N-no way...
Neither of us is foolish enough to have
missed such a large crossroads, right?
Is this... some kind of
illusion or something?
To keep us from leaving
Mitakihara City?
Somehow, I doubt it's something
so simple as that.
I get the sense that nothing actually
exists outside of this Mitakihara City.
Wait... what?
Kyoko, will you keep this secret
from the others for a little while?
There's something I want to
investigate further on my own first.
Dummy, we can't go on like
nothing's wrong after all this!
It will be fine.
I believe it will be safer if we pretend
we haven't discovered anything.
In fact, the more obvious we are,
the more likely it is we'll be hunted.
That's obviously the kind of trap
that's being laid here.
Do you have an idea
of what's going on?
Yes.
Which is why I want you to
refrain from making a scene.
Just leave things
to me for now.
The one who's trapping us hasn't done
anything more than that to us today.
So as long as we play along with them,
I doubt we'll be in any danger.
Okay, I get it.
You may be right that
my memories are mixed up.
Kyoko?
It's strange.
This should be the first time I've ever
seen such a tough Homura Akemi.
But it doesn't seem
out of place on you at all.
In fact, the tough
Homura feels right to me.
Am I the only one
who remembers?
Yes... I've seen this kind
of trap before.
A closed-off world of illusion.
A maze without exit, into which the
prey is lured and led astray.
There's no doubt.
This is a witch's labyrinth.
Witches...
They who spread despair
and give rise to disaster.
They are the final, accursed form of
magical girls who have given in to despair.
In the past, I had fought to
overturn this cruel destiny
by repeating time
over and over.
Until finally, it all ended when
one girl sacrificed herself,
breaking the cruel cycle
of hope and despair.
And with that, the world should
have been led to a new order.
However...
we have all forgotten
what really happened.
Or, rather, we were
made to forget.
And now, someone is trying
to implant false memories.
Here in this false
Mitakihara City.
CHOMP, CHOMP, CHOMP
Hot!
Oh, Bebe, you silly thing!
If you don't mind your manners,
you'll turn into cheese!
Turn into cheese!
Turn into cheese!
You and Bebe really
get along, don't you?
That reminds me, Bebe was even
with you the first time I met you, Mami.
Yes, Bebe has been my friend
for a very long time.
I actually met her even before
I met Madoka and Sayaka.
Do you remember how Bebe
ended up staying with you?
Homura,
why you ask?
I Was just a bit curious.
Somehow, it seems like
such a long-ago event...
Back then, I was the only
magical girl in Mitakihara city.
And the only one I had to support me
and cheer me on was Bebe.
I believe that without Bebe,
I would have given up long ago.
Oh, Mami...
You're much stronger and
braver than that, Mami.
Thank you.
I put up a false bravado to be seen
as a reliable senior magical girl.
But now, Madoka and Sayaka
have come into their own,
and we even have you and Kyoko
to fight beside us as allies.
I can hardly believe the way I'm
surrounded by friends I can rely on now.
I no longer have to strain
to push myself past my limit.
Mami is a real crybaby.
Mami gets lonely super-easy
I know, I know.
Hey, you.
The Nightmares have gotten stronger,
but we've gained more magical girls
so we feel much safer
when we fight than before.
I kinda enjoy fighting and
gathering with friends.
Madoka, fighting Nightmares
is not supposed to be fun.
But I guess it's true that
the way things are now
is the kind of daily life I used
to dream about in the old days.
To think that a life bound by the destiny
of the magical girls could be so happy...
I couldn't even imagine
such a thing back then.
Mami, could I trouble you
for some more tea?
Oh!
It will just take a minute.
I'll boil some more hot water.
Homura, is something
the matter?
Sorry about this, Madoka.
You can drop the act now.
What?
I've remembered
what you really are.
I've recalled what you used to be.
Our memories have
been rewritten,
and we're now trapped in a labyrinth
made to look like Mitakihara City.
The only one who could
have done that is you, Bebe.
Don't understand...
What do you want
with us?
Exactly what is so enjoyable about
toying with us this way?
Memories are troublesome, aren't they?
Once I get one back, other memories
flood in one after the other.
Yes, I remember now.
Mami Tomoe...
I was never comfortable with her.
She would always put on a strong
front and push herself too hard
despite having the softest
heart of any of us.
It always felt too cruel divulging
the truth in front of her.
It hurt me to do so.
I wish I could have gone
on not remembering
just how many people's hearts I
have trampled on to this day...
I don't know.
Don't blame me for that.
Out with it!
What are you trying to achieve
using such a roundabout scheme?
Homura... can't breathe...
I'll turn into cheese...
I'd intended to wait and listen until
I understood what the situation was.
But I couldn't stand by and
watch you hurt Bebe any further.
You've been following us
from the start?
will you explain
what this is about?
What is it that you think
Bebe has done?
You're being tricked by Bebe.
This is not the real Mitakihara City.
All of us have been implanted
with false memories!
Wait a minute.
What's happened to you, Homura?
Run, Bebe!
Do you mean to protect her,
no matter what?
Give up on chasing her.
If you don't, you will
have to fight me.
It seems we can read
one another too well.
But do you think you can
beat me in an equal fight?
In terms of endurance,
I'm better than you!
Well. It seem we aren't
getting anywhere!
Don't!
Homura!
Your magic really is fearsome.
But it's dangerous to always consider your
position superior to your opponent's.
Mami, do you really
not sense anything?
Don't you feel anything strange
about yourself in this world?
You didn't shoot to kill,
so it seems you still have at least
some regard for my well-being.
But why did you attack Bebe?
She's a witch!
The enemy of us magical girls!
Please, remember!
I don't know anything
about these witches.
Our enemies are
the wraiths, right?
That's right... all this time,
I've been fighting the wraiths...
But then... what are
these Nightmares?
What is this?
What on earth...?!
Let me explain it
from my own lips.
Who...?
Bebe?!
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you until now.
But I need you to calm down
and listen to me.
Wh-What on earth are you-
Honestly! What were you thinking,
taking on Mami when she's in peak form?
You're either really
full of yourself or really dumb.
I couldn't help the skirmish
with Mami Tomoe.
It wasn't her I was after.
It was Bebe, wasn't it?
Targeting her just because
she used to be a witch?
I can't believe you jumped
to that conclusion so fast.
You remember everything?
Because that's my role.
But, listen... don't you
think any of this is odd?
A witch going to the trouble of making
a labyrinth huge enough to hold a city,
and then just keeping us here
without harming us or
trying to lure in more victims?
The Sweets Witch you remember would
never have acted so peculiarly, would it?
If you'd just stopped to think about it,
you would've realized that.
This labyrinth isn't a trap
to lure in victims.
What the witch controlling this labyrinth wants
is to maintain the status quo in here.
In other words, who benefits from
the way things are right now?
If you work backwards
from that, it-
Gonna run back into your
own little time again?
That's a bad habit of yours.
You rely too much on that magic.
So you're saying that the person
who wished for this situation is one of us?
Is it really so surprising?
Wasn't Mami just saying earlier
that "this is the happiest
I've ever been in my life?"
How about that? Do you think
Mami is the witch?
The witch is the final form
of the magical girl.
So yes, I suppose
it's possible.
That's just the sort of
answer you would give.
But then, let me ask
you one other thing.
When you find the witch
who created this labyrinth,
what will you do with her?
Well, that... should be obvious.
You'll vanquish her?
Just because she's a witch?
What are you trying to say?
Tell me, is this really so bad?
We don't have to fight anyone.
We can all live, working together.
Is the heart that wished for that so
sinful that it needs to be destroyed?
Are you siding
with a witch?
They are the final form of us
magical girls, as you said.
I can't help but sympathize.
I just remembered the most
crucial point in all this.
The creatures that Mami Tomoe remembered
fighting were wraiths, not witches.
And Kyoko Sakura was unable to
understand the concept of labyrinths,
not because she'd
forgotten the witches
but because neither she nor
Mami ever knew about them.
Which is natural,
since witches no longer
exist in this universe.
The soul of every magical girl is taken by the
Law of the Cycle before it becomes a witch.
That was the new order she created
when she remade the world,
sacrificing herself
in the process.
I see. So you do
remember her.
Yes.
But I should be the only one
who remembers her.
There are three people here
who should not be able to exist.
The first is the witch
who created the labyrinth.
The second is Bebe, who remains
in the form of a witch.
And the third,
you, who remembers
the existence of witches.
Who are you?
Are you really Sayaka Miki?
You make me sad.
I'm the same Sayaka Miki
you've always known,
Transfer Student.
Quick to run away, aren't you?
I thought you were supposed
to be clumsier than that.
You haven't answered
my question yet.
Would you really be okay
destroying this Mitakihara City?
You should think hard on that
before you decide.
So that you won't
have any regrets.
This city is a fake. An idealized
world someone dreamed up.
I've been helping Mami out,
guarding the city.
The way things are now is the kind of
daily life I used to dream about.
Tell me, is this really so bad?
Someone here dragged everyone into
this unattainable dream world,
forsaking our duty
to battle the wraiths.
Such weakness should
be unforgivable.
Magical girls must continue
always to fight.
That was the price we paid
for our miracles.
It's because our fate
is what it is
that she gave up
everything to save us.
This ridiculous farce is just wasting
the sacrifice that Madoka made for us.
I won't allow it.
Homura!
Thank goodness!
I've been looking for you.
Mami is really worried about you.
What happened?
I...
Homura, you shouldn't
go off by yourself.
If you want, I can
at least listen to you.
I may not be able to do
anything to help you,
but it's much better than having
to worry about them on your own.
It really hurts me to
see you suffering so much
and being unable to do
anything about it.
You see, I had a
really scary dream.
A dream?
In it, you had gone to a place so far away
that I had no chance of seeing you again.
And everyone else in the world
forgot all about you.
Only I could remember you
in the whole wide world!
I was so lonely and sad...
But no one could
understand how I felt.
Surrounded by that,
I started thinking my memories of you
were things I'd just made up.
And I began doubting myself.
That's a terrible dream, all right.
But it's okay now.
Because I'd never go alone to
somewhere so far away
that I couldn't see any of you again.
why? How can you
be so sure?
You know how wimpy I am.
And because I could never
bear to do something
that would make someone
as strong as you cry like this.
Then for you, that's something that hurts
you so much you couldn't bear it?
That's right. You, Sayaka...
Mami, Kyoko...
My dad and mom
and Tatsuya...
And even Hitomi and
everyone in our class...
I would never want to go somewhere
I could never see anyone again.
Even if there were
no other choice,
I know I'd never have the courage
to do something like that.
Right... You're right.
Those are your honest feelings.
And yet, I... How could I have
made such a stupid mistake?
I shouldn't have
allowed that to happen.
That no matter what I would've had to do,
I should have stopped you back then.
Madoka.
You should know that even when you
know how much it would hurt you,
you do have the courage
to make that hard decision.
When you learn there is
something that only you can do,
you're far kinder and stronger
than you yourself know.
Trust me, I know this.
Homura?
Right, you probably don't remember
anything either, Madoka.
I know it's possible that you
may be just an illusion
or a false copy
created by someone.
After all, how could we meet
again like this otherwise?
No matter what I consider,
it just seems impossible.
But I can tell.
You are the real Madoka.
I could talk with you like this again,
and I could feel your kindness one more time.
I was so happy.
Thank you. You've made me happier
than I could have ever asked for.
I'm going now. There's
something left that I need to do.
Homura?
What's happened
to Homura, I wonder?
Hello? Homura?
Hey, Kyoko...
Do you remember the witches?
Is this another thing that
I'm supposed to remember?
No, it's actually correct
that you don't remember.
Hey, come on! Are you
messing around with me?!
Then, what about
Madoka Kaname?
Do you remember her?
Of course I do.
What the hell are you...
Hey, do you mean-
Yes.
You shouldn't know her.
Those memories are false.
This sounds like a bad joke.
Are you seriously...?
If I'd stopped and thought about it,
it should have been obvious.
If someone could fabricate
a world where Madoka exists,
they'd have to be someone
who knows about Madoka.
Now, I understand. I know
who rewrote our memories
and then locked us in this
false Mitakihara City.
Hey! Homura!
Are you all right?!
Where are you right now?
There's just one last thing
I want to confirm.
After that, I will end everything.
And I will not trouble you.
Hey!
I'm sorry for getting you
involved in this.
The limit that my body can still move
after separating from my Soul Gem
should be 100 meters at most.
MITAKIHARA LOOP LINE
The next stop is Mitakihara City,
Second Street.
Please use this stop for Mitakihara
Municipal Elementary School.
Stop requested.
In other words, this means I'm not
even a magical girl any longer?
Why?
Why?
Why would I end up as...?
When did it even happen?
When did I
become a witch?!
I'm sure you didn't really
want to know the truth.
And yet, you couldn't bear
not to search for it.
It just goes to show how
illogical human curiosity is.
Well, considering that it was you,
I did think that you would find
the answer eventually,
Homura Akemi.
Incubator...
In the end, just as I thought,
it's your doing, isn't it?
The only questions that remain are the
current location of your life and soul, correct?
I suppose I could
answer those questions.
This is outside the false
Mitakihara City.
This is the real you
out in the real world.
How could that be?!
The Isolation Field we invented is
completely enveloping your Soul Gem.
We wanted to see what would
happen when a Soul Gem
that was already pushed to its limit was
put in an environment that was isolated
from all external influence.
An experiment?
The mysterious power that cleanses
magical girls and then makes them disappear.
We wanted to know what would happen
to a Soul Gem when it was cut off
from the phenomenon that you magical
girls call the "Law of the Cycle."
You showed us some very
interesting results.
The formation of a closed space
by a peculiar principle,
as well as derivation and capture
of victims into the space.
Isn't this the power of the "witch" that
you had once explained to us in the past.
But since your Soul Gem is preserved by
the Isolation Field and remains intact,
you have not yet completed
your transformation into a witch.
You're like a chick that wasn't able to
break its shell and grew up within it.
That was why you wound up
creating a labyrinth internally.
It came as a surprise when you were able
to re-create an entire town within it.
You see, this place is the
world inside your Soul Gem.
Something's off
about your theory.
If it is isolated from
the outside world,
then it should be impossible for people
to wander into this labyrinth.
That was thanks to a little
adjustment we made.
The field's isolation force
only works in one direction.
Though it repels any
interference from outside,
we can still allow victims to pass through the field
by means of an "invitation" from inside.
As a witch, you let the targets
you unconsciously chose
come inside this closed world.
Even under these limited conditions,
if the existence known as the "Law of
the Cycle" still tried to reach Homura Akemi,
the only way for that
existence to enter would be
to rematerialize in this world in the form
of a "victim" that you'd invite in.
And then, we Incubators will finally
be able to identify and observe
this karmic force that makes magical girls
vanish that has remained a mystery to us.
There are several characters
currently within your labyrinth
that don't exist in the real world, yet
somehow participate in it in a strange way.
The most interesting of these is a
certain girl who is not recorded
in any past memory and doesn't seem
to be a future possibility either.
Even though she doesn't exist within
the karmic cycles of our universe,
she was able to slip into your world
without causing the least disturbance.
So it seems there was actually never
any need for us to go searching.
You yourself saved us that trouble,
Homura Akemi.
You have been calling the "Law of the
Cycle" by the name "Madoka Kaname."
Then that girl really is...?
The one disappointment
was that Madoka Kaname
never displayed any signs
of unusual power.
It seems the memory rewriting
conducted by you,
the master of the labyrinth,
affected her as well.
She not only forgot that
she had come to save you,
but lost sight of who she
really was and her power as well.
As a result, we couldn't
do anything to her.
Madoka Kaname forgot
she was a god,
and Homura Akemi forgot
she was a witch.
Thanks to that, we ended up coming along
for this grand, pointless endeavor.
We had intended to wait
patiently and observe,
but since you went and
discovered the truth,
the delicate balance within
has begun to crumble.
Now then, Homura Akemi.
Reach out to Madoka
Kaname for help.
That will make her remember who she
really is and what she came here to do.
Incubator, tell me what
your real goal is here.
To confirm the existence of
the "Law of the Cycle" of course
that has been a
mere hypothesis until now.
For what purpose?
Satisfying mere curiosity is illogical,
as you keep saying.
I won't believe that you
went to such lengths
just to confirm that
Madoka exists.
You intend to control
Madoka, don't you?!
I won't deny that that was the
end goal we had in mind.
Though it would have been a very
long and difficult endeavor.
After all, this phenomenon has
been a complete mystery to us.
We can't interfere with something
when we can't confirm its existence.
Not that you'd give up
just because of that.
True enough. If we could just observe it,
we'd be able to interfere with it.
And if we could interfere with it,
we'd be able to control it.
Our research would allow us to conquer the
"Law of the Cycle" completely someday.
And then, we could have
magical girls turn into witches
and collect vast amounts
of energy all at once.
The phase change between
hope and despair.
The volume of energy that is
created in those emotions
is far beyond anything
we had imagined.
Truly, magical girls hold the key
to limitless possibilities.
All of you magical girls should fulfill your
existence by transforming into a witch!
Why are you angry?
All this has nothing to
do with you anymore.
The existence of Homura Akemi
has reached its completion.
At the end of your relentless fate,
you've fulfilled your promise to meet
the one you've waited so long for.
Shouldn't that bring you joy?
No.
This is not the joy
that I wished for.
Are you serious?
You're raising a curse yourself?
What are you thinking?
At this rate, the purification
won't catch up!
As you are now, you likely
wouldn't know this,
but you see, I became a magical
girl solely to save Madoka.
And that holds true even now!
If the alternative is revealing
Madoka's secret to you,
I would rather let myself
turn into a witch.
I'll never let you Incubators
touch Madoka again!
Would you give up your only
salvation just for that?
Do you mean to spend the rest of eternity
living amongst all these curses?
I'll be fine. I'm certain that
this labyrinth will be my grave.
Mami Tomoe and Kyoko Sakura
are both here.
I believe in them.
That's ridiculous...
Do you understand what it would mean
if you died within the Isolation Field?
You won't even be able to
break out of the shell
and will end up a fully born
witch inside the egg.
You'll be destroyed without
being found by the Law of the Cycle.
No one will ever be able to
save your soul from despair.
You would lose your chance to see
Madoka Kaname again, forever.
Just shut up!
To you, wouldn't that be the
worst possible outcome?
Honestly, why is human thought
so incomprehensibly illogical?
Madoka?
So this is a witch...
My emotions have all come
back to haunt me.
I can't remember anything
but glimmers of light and regret.
Ah, so this is my...
... despair.
Madoka!
Thank you for coming
all the way to a place like this.
I'm sorry I couldn't even say
"goodbye" to you in the end.
Is that... a witch?
Please try not to look scared.
Despite her appearance,
she's the most hurt.
This has gotta be a bad joke.
Wait a moment!
That's Homura Akemi.
Do you mean to fight your own friend?
Kyubey...
Oh, I didn't know
you could talk normally.
It's unfortunate, Kyubey,
but we'll just have to trust in
what Bebe has told us.
Madoka! You should have
the power to save Homura!
All you have to do is acknowledge
the real power inside of you!
Ignore him, Madoka.
It'll be fine. Just do it the
way I told you earlier.
R-right.
Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-Pa-
Parmigiano Reggiano!
Easy.
It's not like we're going
to take you to the outside.
Wh-What are you?
We were once bringers of hope,
who despaired and spread our curses.
Now we are those guided
by the Law of the Cycle
to break free from the chains of
destiny binding this world.
We figured that this plan would allow us
to move freely right under your nose,
Incubator.
You were so focused on Madoka
that you failed to notice us.
No...
So you two were also
part of the Law of the Cycle?
Well, in other words, we're something
like her private secretary, you know?
Because someone had to hold
all her memories and powers
until it was time to give
them back to her!
We planned that if things went bad,
at least one of us would survive
and be able to return
her true memories to her.
Honestly, sending as many as
three people just to get Homura...
She's making a lot of
extra work for us.
But since it's for her,
I guess it can't be helped.
She's worked so hard,
she deserves a reward at least.
Sayaka...
Madoka! It's time for us
to work as well!
R-right!
Stop! Please, stop!
I have to die in this world!
Like I said,
stop trying to take on
these huge burdens all by yourself.
Jeez, you guys got me
involved in this crazy stuff!
Gotcha!
Thank you!
I had a sickening dream.
A dream where you were dead.
But you're saying that that was real
and this right here, where
we're fighting side by side,
this is the dream, Sayaka?
This isn't something quite
as sad as just a dream.
I thought I didn't have
any regrets when I died.
But the reason I ended up taking
this assignment and coming back
was because I actually
do have one regret.
The fact that I
left you behind.
I just wanted to eat
cheese one more time!
Hey, you! Don't ruin the mood!
You dummy!
Tiro Finale!
Homura!
Stop, Madoka!
I can see it!
The Incubators' seal!
If we can break that,
you'll be free, Homura!
Without the Incubators'
interference,
you'll be able to reach the outside
world and see the real Madoka again!
That's no good, Homura.
I told you that you shouldn't
go off by yourself.
Madoka...
No matter what happens,
you Will always be you, Homura.
And I would never abandon you.
So don't give up.
I'm sorry...
I'm so spineless...
I wanted to see you
one more time.
And if I had to go so far
as to betray that wish...
Y es, I knew I could
shoulder any sin.
No matter what I became,
I knew I'd be fine with it.
As long as I could
have you by my side.
Now, Homura. Together...
Yes...
Homura, you aren't afraid?
No. I'm fine.
I won't hesitate any longer.
I just don't understand at all!
Are they gone now?
Sayaka, and your Bebe too?
No.
They're finally taking her
away with them.
Is that Madoka Kaname?
Yes.
The Law of the Cycle, which will
one day lead us away too.
Now I remember.
I came here for Homura.
I can't believe I could forget
something so important.
Well, there was quite a bit
of unnecessary interference.
We ended up taking a pretty
roundabout path, huh?
What a bother...
I'm sorry for making you
wait so long.
You've worked so hard
all this time.
Madoka...
Now, let's go.
We'll always be together
from now on.
Yes, we will.
I've waited so long for this.
Homura?
I've finally...
caught you.
H-hey!
W-What's going on?
Homura?!
Her Soul Gem has changed to a color
even worse than a curse?!
What is that?
Desire? Insatiability?
No, it's something else!
Homura Akemi,
what on earth are you-
It's only natural that
you don't understand.
Yes... No one in the world
could possibly understand.
This emotion is mine alone.
It is for Madoka alone.
Homura, don't!
You'll rip me apart!
I told you, Madoka.
I'll never let you go again.
The world is being rewritten.
Does this mean a new principle
has been born into this universe?
That reminds me. You don't remember
the last time anymore, do you?
For me, this is the second time
I've seen this place.
What's happening?
Homura Akemi,
what are you meddling in?
What have you changed?
I don't believe this.
Your curse-blackened Soul Gem should
have vanished along with your soul.
So why...?
Because I finally remembered.
All the times I repeated history,
got hurt and suffered over and over,
all of that was proof of
my feelings for Madoka.
So now, even pain
is dear to me.
It was not even curses
that soiled my Soul Gem.
Then what did?
Something that you have no chance
of understanding, Incubator.
It is the pinnacle
of all human emotion.
More passionate than hope,
far deeper than despair.
Love.
Then what on earth
are you now?
Neither a magical girl nor a witch,
what are you trying to become?
Indeed...
As I am now, I'm not even
a witch any longer.
She was as sacred as a god, and I couldn't help
but pull her from heaven and undermine her.
A being that could
perform such feats
could only be called
a demon, I suppose?
This makes it very clear.
Trying to make use of human emotion
is just too dangerous.
We could never hope to control something
whose final form is so irrational.
Is that so?
But to handle all the curses that
have spread around our world,
you Incubators are now
necessary for us.
So you'll be staying to help...
...Incubator.
Do you realize
what you've done?
I see. Looks like you understand
what's happened,
Sayaka Miki.
You've broken off a part
of the Law of the Cycle!
The power of salvation that was
the hope of all the magical girls!
All I took was a
tiny piece of it.
Just the records of the person that
Madoka was before she ceased to exist.
Somehow, all of you wound up
being pulled in as well,
and it seems you can't return
to wherever you were before.
What right do you have
to do all of this?
I am now an existence known as "Evil."
A being who disrupts providence and
acts as an agitator for this world.
It's quite natural that I upset the laws
set down by a god, don't you think?
Do you intend to destroy
this universe?
After all the wraiths have
been destroyed, perhaps I will.
When that time comes,
I suppose I can be your enemy.
But do you think you'll be able to
stand against me, Sayaka Miki?
Even now, your memories are
gradually changing, are they not?
It's true, I... think I was part
of a larger being before.
I know I was connected to a power
that existed outside this world,
but I can't remember
what it was anymore.
I should've been somewhere
other than here.
Why don't you
simply enjoy the happiness from
getting another chance to live a human life?
Someday, you'll forget all
that happened in the past,
and this place will seem
perfectly natural to you.
Even if that happens,
the one thing I'll never forget
is that you, Homura Akemi,
are a demon!
We should pretend to
be friendly in daily life.
If you're confrontational all the time,
even she may dislike you.
Hey, Sayaka!
Good mooning.
Good morning, Sayaka.
Oh... yeah.
Um... Good morning.
Yep, good morning!
To you both.
Is something the matter, Sayaka?
No, it's just...
I didn't realize how happy
it would make me
to be able to say
"good morning" to you again.
As usual, you're saying all sorts
of mysterious things, Sayaka.
That's right.
I'm one mysterious gal!
Now girls, I want you to remember...
...that you must never date men who insist
they can't eat eggs unless they are half-boiled.
And boys, you'd better not
grow up so petty
as to fuss over how
your eggs are done, okay?
Now that that's out of the way, let's
welcome our new transfer student!
Come on in, Miss Kaname!
Um... It's nice to meet you.
My name is Madoka Kaname.
Mom's- My mother's company
assigned her to work overseas,
so my whole family lived in
the U. S. for three years.
We finally came back to
Mitakihara City last week,
so I'll be in class with you
starting today.
I, um... it's a pleasure
to meet you!
Since Miss Kaname hasn't gone to
school in Japan for a while,
I'm counting on all of you
to help her out.
Hey, Miss Kaname, what was it like,
going to school in America?
Are you fluent in English?
That's so cool! I'm so jealous!
You're so teeny and cute!
You look like a grade-schooler!
Well, I don't know about that. I, um...
Everyone, you'll tire Miss Kaname out,
bombarding her with questions like that.
You should give her a moment.
Oh... Um, okay.
I'm Homura Akemi.
Pleased to meet you, Madoka Kaname.
May I call you Madoka?
Um... Sure.
This may be abrupt, but let me
show you around the school.
Come with me.
Um, M-Miss Akemi?
You can call me Homura.
Homura...?
Um... Um... Why are you
showing me around?
How does it feel to be
back after so long?
Um, well, everything's
so familiar and nostalgic.
But also kind of
different somehow.
It's a strange feeling.
That's no surprise.
It has been three years, after all.
No, it actually seems like absolutely
nothing has changed.
In fact, if I had to pick the
one thing that had changed,
I'd say it was me.
That's right...
I should have a different form.
A different role...
So why...?
H-Homura?!
H-hey! What...?
It's all right. You are
exactly what you truly are.
Madoka Kaname.
Do you treasure this world?
Do you consider stability and order
more important than desire?
Well, I... Um...
I-I do treasure it.
I guess I do think it's kind of bad to
break rules because you feel like it.
I see...
Then I suppose someday,
you will become my enemy as well.
But I don't care.
Because even then,
I will continue to wish for a world
in which you will be happy.
H-Homura? Um...
They really do look
better on you after all.
