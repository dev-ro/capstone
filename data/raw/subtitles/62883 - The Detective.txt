- Morning, Kelly.
- Sergeant.
Aren't two homicides in one week
enough for you, Tanner?
- Wait till you see this one.
- What makes it any different?
Leikman's son.
- {y:i}The Leikman?
- {y:i}The Leikman.
Oh, Sergeant Joe Leland,
Robbie Loughren.
- You the new guy?
- Yes, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
Anyone been in or out of here
since you've been here?
- No, sir, just our men.
- That's good. Let's keep it that way.
- Where is it?
- Second floor.
Landlady found him 20 minutes ago.
Let's go.
I hear you're the best detective in town.
{y:i}(chuckles)
- How bad is it?
- I don't know, Sergeant.
I just got here
a few minutes before you did.
Careful.
My God.
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not.
You're gonna tense your muscles
and get out the notebook.
Male Caucasian lying nude on floor.
Penis cut off.
Lying on floor of living room.
Side of skull smashed in.
Cuts on face and chest.
Fingers shredded.
Index and thumb of right hand missing.
- Hi, Joe.
- Doc.
Hi, Sarge.
Schoenstein. Take a couple of pictures
of that thing, will you?
And get some newspaper and fish it up.
Put it in the corner
where nobody'll kick it around.
What kind of work is this
for a nice Jewish boy?
- Anything yet, Curran?
- Not so far.
- How about you fellas? Find anything?
- Zero.
- Mercidis?
- Yeah?
Take a walk for about four blocks
and look in all the garbage cans.
- What are we looking for?
- A couple of fingers, and{y:i}lor a knife.
Nestor, you try the same thing
on the roof, will you?
This is Robbie Loughren.
Nestor, Mercidis.
Hi.
What do you suppose that is?
- Salt?
- Sand.
Put some of it in here.
I want a lab report on that.
Give me a lab report on everything
in this medicine cabinet, too.
Also, there's semen stains
on the sheets.
Weights. Barbell.
Mineral oil.
- Take this along with the other stuff.
- All right.
Robbie. Check those clothes.
Anything you find in those pockets,
bring downtown with you.
Stay with it, Mac.
- Well, Doc?
- Junior there was a homosexual.
Looks like he was a leader.
What did you find?
The mutilations were caused
by some kind of knife.
- What killed him, though?
- Right now, looks like
the blows on the head. He was
struck five, six times, maybe more.
Lovers' quarrel.
This is the way they settled it.
Takes all kinds, doctor.
- They don't disturb you?
- I got my own bag.
20 years,
they still disturb the hell out of me.
That's an interesting comment.
When can I get the lab report?
Late this evening
or early tomorrow morning.
- OK.
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.
- I got a girl outside.
Lives upstairs.
Landlady said she saw a lot of Leikman.
OK. Thanks, Doc.
Miss Linjack?
Sergeant Joe Leland.
- What can I do for you?
- We'd like to ask you a few questions.
- What is it?
- It's about Mr. Leikman.
Teddy.
Did something happen to Teddy?
- He's dead.
- Dead?
- You've been out all night?
- Yes.
- Tell me, what happened?
- Somebody killed him.
- Killed him?
- No, you don't wanna go in there.
- Would you like to help us?
- I don't know anything.
What was your relationship
to Mr. Leikman?
He needed someone
to take out to parties,
- so it would look all right.
- What did you get out of it?
I knew he was gay, but he was civilized,
and he had a bit of wit,
which is more than I can say
for most people.
Do you know if he had any other friends
of a similar persuasion?
His roommate.
Roommate?
Did you say roommate?
Teddy took in a roommate last week.
What made you sure
he was a roommate?
I... came down to Teddy's apartment
to find out what time we were going out
and another man came to the door.
I told Teddy I was sorry to disturb him,
and he said it was all right.
It was just his roommate.
- What was his name?
- Teddy didn't say.
- Can you describe this roommate?
- Um...
He was an unsavory character.
Medium build.
Long sideburns, like an actor.
- Color hair?
- Black.
- Age, approximately.
- Late 20s, 30. It's hard to tell.
Robbie, get out a John Doe.
Wanted for questioning
in connection with a homicide. Also
send it to the state and county police.
- He may be on the road.
- All right.
Anything else you can remember,
Miss Linjack? Anything at all?
No.
You don't seem to be feeling much grief
over the death of your friend Teddy.
If I am, I'm not showing it.
That's clear, isn't it?
Ahem. Miss Linjack,
we have a sketch artist downtown
and you'd help a great deal
with your description. Would you mind?
- May I change my clothes?
- Of course.
Officer Tanner will stay with you.
- Thank you, I can get there on my own.
- Officer Tanner will stay with you.
Cop-hater.
- I like her.
- What's there to like?
I like the way she stuck up for
her friend Teddy.
I think I also like her
because she's a cop-hater.
{y:i}(man) All right! Out of my way!
Aw, get outta here! Out of my way!
Who's in charge here?
- Oh. It's you.
- I was only following your orders.
It's all right, Kelly,
I'll take the responsibility.
Only people with official business
are allowed, Mr. Councilman.
How'd you get by that frozen zone?
Listen, I have a badge
from the sheriff's office.
It doesn't work here.
- No one's ever stopped me before.
- Mr. Davis, every time you show up
and give everything you know to
the newspapers, it's not helpful to us.
Do you know the rising rate of crime in
this town? Do you know the statistics?
Some of us want to do something
about it. Do you realize...
You picked a lousy spot
for a campaign speech.
- I'm going in.
- No, you're not.
Show Mr. Councilman outside. If he
gives you any trouble, cuff him, frisk him
- and run him downtown.
- You bastard!
I'm gonna talk to the mayor about you.
- Hey. Captain Farrell wants to see you.
- It figures.
- What's your name?
- Sidney.
- You ever been arrested before?
- No.
- Do you live in this neighborhood?
- Yeah.
- Do you like to play ball?
- Yeah.
You can't do much ball-playing
when you're in jail.
Do you want me to tell
your mother and father about this?
No.
You know a cop when you see one.
You got me a good customer.
Officer, tell the judge
I asked you for 50 instead of 25.
- I don't want to ruin my reputation.
- Hm. Sure, sure.
You, what's your name?
- Do you want to see me?
- Yeah.
Was this Davis thing necessary?
Do we have to play patsy for every
bum in this town running for reelection?
- Was it necessary?
- No, it wasn't necessary.
Well, why don't you go down
and tell him you're sorry.
Would you like to have my badge first?
You're dealing with
the murder of the son
of one of the most successful
businessmen in this city.
Headquarters won't hesitate a minute
in shaking up this whole department!
You've got everybody's ass in a sling.
Mine included.
You have to take it from those bastards.
I don't have to.
I know, I know.
Nothing matters to you.
Nothing but your goddamn dignity.
Well, you can take your dignity
out for a walk.
- Is that all, Captain?
- Yeah! Just get the hell out of here.
Yes, sir.
- Hello.
- Well, who are you looking for?
- The hostess, I presume.
- Oh. Karen, it's for you.
Somebody interesting.
- Hello, Joe.
- Hi.
- Uh, can I get you a drink?
- Oh, I know what he likes.
Come on.
- Mike.
- Yes?
- Mike, that's Joe Leland.
- Oh, yes.
Yes. Karen's talked a lot about you, Joe.
That so?
What's she saying about me?
- She's married to a man who's a cop?
- Yes.
She also said you're
the brightest man she ever knew.
I read about Leikman's son.
It's quite a thing, isn't it?
Oh, yeah.
It's quite a thing.
- There.
- Thank you.
Nice meeting you.
- Here, let me take your hat.
- No, it's all right.
That fellow over there is going to make
a speech about the benefits of LSD.
Don't you want to hear
what he has to say?
I think I'll pass.
Did you want to talk to me
about something?
I did, yeah.
Well, we can go someplace.
No. Another time.
{y:i}(# slow dance)
Say, would you keep an eye
on these, please, buddy?
Thank you!
- Who are you?
- Who are you?
- Karen Widener.
- Joe Leland.
- I haven't seen you around here before.
- I haven't been around.
I'm in sociology.
How nice for sociology.
Huh. Who are you and why
do you try to sound so tough?
I am tough.
- Who are you?
- I'm with the cops.
I beg your pardon?
I'm a policeman
taking a night course in criminology.
You're kidding.
Thank you.
Well...
- I take it you didn't like the play.
- I didn't like the play.
I never saw anything
so meaningful in my life.
He's a phony.
Do you know anything about plays,
Mr. Leland?
A little bit, yes.
Well, who are your favorite playwrights?
How about O'Casey and Shaw.
Well, what do you know about O'Casey?
Mr. O'Casey writes about the joys of life,
not the futility of it all.
- What do you do, Mr. Leland?
- He's with the cops.
- You're kidding.
- That's what I said.
Well, I always said,
a little learning in a policeman
is a dangerous thing.
Hey!
Where are you going?
I'm going home because you and
your friends give me a pain in the ass.
Wow!
- Hello.
- Hi.
- What's your problem?
- Heart trouble.
Would you like to explain that?
Well... there's this man I know.
- Are you in love with him?
- Oh, I don't know.
But he's the only real man I've ever met.
Nah. I bet you tell that to all the cops.
Hmm.
How many girls
have you brought up here?
Couple thousand.
No. I mean seriously.
How many have you had
right here on this couch?
Did you notice that we haven't
had a fight all evening?
Yep. I noticed.
That's probably because for a minute
you forgot that I was a fascist cop.
Why do you want to be a cop?
'Cause my old man was a cop
and his old man was a cop.
Everybody in my family was a cop.
That's why.
Why do {y:i}you want to be a cop?
Because it's the most useful
and constructive thing I can do.
- Don't you understand?
- I understand. Don't bite my head off.
What about you?
I mean, I don't know anything about you.
What do you want to know?
- Well, for instance, your family.
- What about them?
- There isn't any.
- What do you mean, there isn't any?
Well, I was the proverbial
baby left on the doorstep.
Don't look so sad.
It isn't that tragic.
Well, were you adopted?
If you're not taken by the time you're
three, they don't pick you up too easily.
But I lived in a few foster homes,
you know.
Best thing about it
was I had a room of my own.
The state requires
you have a room of your own.
I said, don't look so sad.
It isn't such a bad life.
No scars?
Oh, I just go to my psychiatrist
twice a week now.
- Oh. You don't approve of that?
- Not particularly.
I happen to feel that people should
try to work out their own problems.
Well, that's manly of you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Ever been married?
- Engaged?
- Nope.
- Many guys?
- Yes.
And on my terms.
Not theirs.
Yeah.
I've been to the post a few times myself.
And I was beginning to think
that nobody else in the world
would ever interest me again.
Let's not talk about those things, Joe.
Let's just enjoy each other.
- I don't want to be this way with you.
- Why not?
- I want this to be different.
- It will be.
{y:i}(crowd cheering)
I'm sorry I'm late.
- How did it go?
- Oh, fine.
I think I got my associate professorship.
- Me! Lmagine!
- I think it's wonderful.
- Yeah?
- Just great.
Did you give any thought
to what we talked about?
Oh. I don't know, Joe.
What do you mean you don't know?
You either love me or you don't love me.
Oh, I love you, but it...
It just isn't that simple, you know.
You keep talking in riddles all the time.
What's to keep us apart?
Well, uh, I'm... I've been around
and you've been around.
We're both kind of set in our ways
and everything, you know.
Sure, but that's why
we ought to do something about it,
while there's still time.
- Are you wacky enough to take on me?
- Try me.
- Yeah, baby.
- You know something?
- What?
- If I don't marry you, I'm crazy.
- What did you say?
- I said, if I don't marry you, I'm crazy.
- Hi, Joe. How's the bridegroom?
- Tired. What else?
{y:i}(man) Shut up, you silly son of a bitch.
{y:i}(man #2) I didn't mean to do it.
- What's that?
- Wait'll you hear this.
{y:i}(man #2) You don't think
I meant to do it, do you?
{y:i}(man) You didn't mean it?
Why, you stupid...
Harmon, you're a stupid jerk.
- What is it?
- Well, he did it this time.
- He killed one of them.
- I couldn't help it!
I yelled for them to stop.
You know what it's like up there.
That doesn't give you
the license to shoot a man.
I didn't mean to shoot him.
- You didn't mean to shoot him.
- The gun went off!
Wait till those civil rights bastards
get ahold of this.
I didn't mean to do it.
Who cares?
You put us all in the crapper.
I heard it on the radio.
Great! Just great!
In my office. Come on!
- Tanner, you his partner?
- Yeah.
Let's go. Come on.
Shut the door.
All right, Tanner.
Tell us what happened.
We were following these guys.
They were speeding.
Jack kept the siren going.
We cut 'em off.
Jack took his revolver out,
walked over to the car and leaned in.
There was a shot.
The car lurched. That's all I know.
I didn't know...
I didn't know what he could have
been doing in there.
He reached for the glove compartment.
He could have been
reaching for anything.
There were five of them - drunk.
Well, you can't have it both ways.
It was either an accident
or you panicked. Which way was it?
- It was an accident.
- An accident.
You walked over to the car
and you leaned in.
Show me what happened.
I'm the man in the car.
Come on.
Show me.
How close was your revolver to him?
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?
You said the car lurched.
Was it before or after, did you say?
- Well, I... I...
- Never mind.
Tanner, didn't you just say
that he walked over to the car,
gun drawn, leaned in the car, there
was a shot and then the car lurched?
Isn't that what you said?
Wasn't it?
It could have been before.
It could have been before.
Harmon, if I get you through this, it'll
be for the department, not for you.
If you get him through this...?
Shut up, Joe, and get out of here.
If the civil rights group
doesn't take care of you,
and if the Department
doesn't take care of you,
you keep your eye on me, Mr. Harmon.
So go to the newspapers. Tell them
they're trying to whitewash Harmon.
- I can't do that to the Department.
- The Department?
I've watched the way
this thing eats you up.
The way Farrell tries to
twist you around.
Darling, why do you take it?
I mean, you could go anywhere.
You could do anything.
It's what I do best. It's my life
and it's worth something.
I know it's tough for somebody
in the outside to understand.
You know, I remember once I saw
my old man climb to the top of a bridge
to keep some poor sick soul
from jumping off.
And then he cried like a baby
after the guy went over the side.
Some life I gave you.
Out all day on the chase,
then I bring it all home to you.
Yeah, you got some deal, you did.
- I got a very good deal.
- Huh!
You give so much and get so little.
No, you lie back and relax.
You let me make love to you this time.

- Yeah?
- I gotta talk to you.
- What is it this time?
They're gonna bust me.
- Still on the junk, huh?
- No, honest, Joe.
Don't "honest" me, sweetheart.
You need a pop right now.
- Who's handling the beef?
- Some hardhead named Callahan.
I wanna see Christmas.
I haven't seen Christmas in two years.
I'll see.
I'll see about it.
- Cute kid.
- Yeah, cute kid.
She's a whore, she's a pusher,
she's an addict, and she's 19 years old.
This whole town
is crawling with kids just like her.
Same age.
All going the same route.
Part of the Great Society.
- Uh, Joe, you sore at me?
- No, I'm not sore.
I liked you from the minute your old man
brought you into my office.
You know, you could make it.
You could make it big.
- But, uh, you've never been able to...
- Kiss ass.
I-I don't get this loner thing.
Your old man was never that way.
You know, uh, with Karen,
you were more of a human being.
She was such a good influence on you.
I wish... I wish
you'd never split up with her.
- Oh, Jilly, let's have a beer, huh?
- Coming up.
You know, uh, you've solved
two homicides this week.
Your promotion was all set.
- And then this Davis thing.
- Aw, screw it, will you, Tom?
Leave it alone.
Joe, what's gonna happen to you?
You're not getting any younger.
I don't know
what's gonna happen to me.
Maybe the same thing
happened to my old man.
I'll wind up on the scrap heap.
But you could make it
all the way to the top.
Don't make bets on it.
You know, the promotion
for lieutenancy comes up this month.
You know that, don't you?
Jeez, I'd hate to see Curran get it.
He's sucking up to 'em all the time.
Joe, do you think you could
crack this Leikman thing?
Hard to say. We got a few leads,
but I don't know where they'll take us.
Do you... do you think you could
crack it in 48 hours? Huh?
Well, that's a nice phrase.
A nice ring to it.
That youngster was just here -
the name's Sharon Henesey.
She's being rousted
by a cop named Callahan.
Talk to him, will you? See if you can
get him to ease off a little bit?
Sure, sure. Fine.
Oh, Joe, by the way,
the newspaper boys have been calling.
They want to speak to you.
You know, the Davis thing.
Could you see them
in the station tomorrow morning?
You're gonna be there, aren't you, Tom?
Uh, I kinda think it's better if you'd...
- No, it's all right. Thanks.
...if you'd speak to them alone.
Thanks. All right, Tom.
{y:i}(man) Say, what's this
between you and Davis?
{y:i}(man #2) He really
went after you, didn't he?
{y:i}(man #3) Davis says
you don't have a thing.
How would he know?
There's more to police work
than flashing a badge around.
Stay out of this, will you, Dave?
{y:i}(man #4) What was Davis
doing here yesterday morning?
He was buffing.
- Buffing, did you say?
- Uh-huh.
A buff is a guy
who hangs around the police, isn't he?
Correct.
Do you disapprove of buffing?
Not at all. We have them here
all the time.
They go out for sandwiches,
cigarettes,
run errands, make themselves
generally useful.
- Can we quote you on that?
- That's what you're here for.
- Do you send Davis out for coffee?
- Uh-uh. No, we tried that once.
He screwed it all up.
He got a Danish instead of a doughnut.
He got coffee black
instead of cream and sugar.
He was murder.
I'll see you.
- Thanks a lot.
- Thanks, Leland.
What's the progress
on the Leikman case?
Oh, I expect we'll get a break
in 48 hours or so.
- Quote you on that?
- Be my guest.
What made you say 48 hours?
- It sounded good, didn't it?
- {y:i}Oy vey iz mir.
- Here's a sketch of the suspect.
- Nestor, you were in Vice.
You know where the gay boys
hang out, don't you?
Yeah, I know.

Go on, get out of here.
- Let's go.

Come on, come on. Get out here.

Get over there. Go on, get out.

Don't hurt your shins.
All right, baby, come on.
- I'm not gonna hurt you. Let's go.
- All right, all right.
All right, you first. You.
You come here. Come on.
- You!
- Get over there.
You're a young one, aren't you?
You're off to a good start.
- You know this man?
- No.
- What?
- No!
Did you ever know
Theodore Leikman, Jr.?
- Leikman?
- Yeah, one of your kind.
No, I never knew him.
Don't worry, son,
no one's gonna hurt you.
You're not gonna
tell my parents, are you?
- Did you know him?!
- No!
Take it easy.
These people are not murderers.
I know what I'm doing, and I'll handle it.
All right - you! Come here.
{y:i}(whistles) You!
- Tell him to get his hands off me.
- Oh, you're a wise one, huh?
What makes you think you can
push me around like that?
- What are you doing here?
- I was just takin' a walk.
Oh, just takin' a walk, huh?
Well, Curran, we've seen him
around before, haven't we?
Yeah, I've seen him
with some young ones.
Contributing to
the delinquency of minors.
Have you ever met this man?
- No...
- Look at it!
Did you ever know
Theodore Leikman Jr.?
Answer him.
No. I never knew him.
- OK. Come on.
- Wait. I want to book him.
For what? Go on.
- Yeah, go on!
- Ow! {y:i}(groans)
I want to see you a second.
Nestor, you're
a miserable son of a bitch.
Yes, sir.
A half gallon of mineral oil.
- Maybe he had constipation.
- Not likely.
Hey, maybe he used it to oil his pal.
It's too thin. You need something thick
like Vaseline.
- How do you know?
- Hey, men and women use Vaseline.
- I wouldn't know.
- Neither would I.
- Congratulations.
- Some people like to drink it.
You keep that up
and you're gonna be a suspect.

Listen, I just want you to know
what a stinking thing
I think this is with Davis.
OK.
Well, is there anything I can do?
Nope.
- Are you gonna be all right?
- I'll handle it.
OK. Good luck, Joe.
Let's check out all the Ys,
the body-beautiful places,
- weightlifting joints, and the gyms.
- What for?
They make their bodies shiny
by using this stuff, you know.
I think Teddy used to
like to look at these things.
Maybe he went where they hang out.
Maybe that's where
he met his roommate.
{y:i}(grunting)
- He's not gonna drop that, is he?
- We never drop anything.
Listen, did Theodore Leikman Jr.
Ever come in here?
Yes, he did. That little crumb!
Hallelujah.
Did you ever see anybody
with him who looks like this?
Oh, yes. The strange one.
- Well, what's his name?
- Tesla. Felix Tesla.
- Tesla. Felix Tesla.
- Maybe he's from out of town.
And maybe he's in Mexico by now.

Don't be foolish.
Stay out of it.
{y:i}(Robbie) Sarge, Sarge,
he's heading for the beach!
All right. Cool it.
{y:i}(man) Hey, here's our man now.
{y:i}(man #2) What's his name, huh?
{y:i}(man #3) Did you cut up Teddy's body?
- {y:i}(man #4) Look this way.
All right, all right,
cool it, cool it, move back.
{y:i}(overlapping shouting)
{y:i}(man #5) Get close to him, Joe,
you're part of the story.
Get the hell out of here.
Get out of the way.
Come on, Joe, give us a break.
Come on.
- Did you inform him of his rights?
- I did.
Boys, take him inside
and start talking to him.
- You. You go with him.
- Yes, sir.
I got something to show you.
Kelly.
Give me that yellow sheet
on the suspect, huh?
Hm. Get a load of this.
"Arrested Toronto,
assault and battery, robbery.
"Sentenced two years.
"Sentence suspended
condition to military service.
"Dishonorably discharged
Canadian Army.
Felonious assault - bottle.
Felonious assault - knife."
He's been a pretty busy boy.
Joe, we gotta get that confession now.
If you can crack this,
you can make Davis eat turd
and you can get your promotion.
{y:i}(Curran) Lift your head up.
Lift your head up!
I said, lift your head up!
Here, take a look
at this picture of Teddy.
Look at it!
Look at it!
That's what you did to him.
You think you're gonna
sit there and not talk?
We'll take you down to the cellar.
You know what we do
down in the cellar, Felix?
Felix, just tell us
what you used on him, huh?
Just tell us that, huh?
What did you do with the knife?
What did you do with the knife, you fag?
Muscles isn't saying anything.
I'll fix that.
Hey, fag! All right. Fag!
All right, all right. Everybody out.
Come on, everybody out.
You too, Nestor. Out.
Want some coffee?
Pretty rough, huh?
You're from Toronto, huh?
Is that Circus Bar still open up there?
Oh yes, Felix,
I've been around a long time.
I know all the places.
But you know what I say?
I believe in live and let live.
Look, Felix, I know it's rough,
but it doesn't have to be.
Now tell me about Teddy.
What kind of a man was he?
Come on, tell me.
I mean, we don't know
too much about him,
but what I do know,
he wasn't a very nice man.
And I can understand something
happening to a man like that.
Now, you met him over at
the health club, didn't you?
Became quite friendly over there.
And then he asked you to
come and live with him, didn't he?
It wasn't easy living with Teddy, was it?
He wasn't nice, was he?
{y:i}(sniffling)
Now, he wasn't nice.
Now come on, tell me.
Am I wrong?
Was he nice?
- He was a bitch.
- A bitch.
Nothing was good enough for him.
Nobody was good enough for him.
He laughed at everybody.
He laughed at me.
Oh, he was educated.
Him with his education!
{y:i}(sobbing)
Tell me about his body.
What do you mean, huh?
- I mean, what you liked about it.
- Oh.
- It was nice.
- Nice?
Well, how nice?
What kind of nice?
- It was like a girl's.
- You mean soft.
Um...
No, no, no. We say the words.
Soft, like a girl.
Oh, it was soft.
Soft like a girl's.
Oh!
Felix.
Listen to me, Felix.
- He teased you, didn't he?
- Oh, yes.
He teased you
and he called you names, didn't he?
Yes.
What kind of names did he call you?
- Bull. Stud.
- Stud.
Names like that.
- He said you were stupid, didn't he?
- Yes.
And he laughed at you.
And you hated him, didn't you?
Oh, I hated him.
I hated him!
Felix, tell me about Friday night.
What did you fight about?
- He wanted me to leave.
- And you wanted to stay?
Until I found a job.
But he wanted me to leave right away.
I had those-those-those
few dollars saved.
I didn't want to spend it.
I didn't have to,
but he wanted me to go out.
- So you left?
- Just to calm down.
Then you came back
and you argued, didn't you?
He called you some more names,
didn't he? But he went too far this time
and then you hit him, didn't you?
And you kept hitting him
until you broke his skull, didn't you?
Isn't that so?
- Face it, Felix, face it!
- No!
Say it. You'll feel better for it. You
can't walk around the rest of your life
- with a thing like that on your head.
- No.
You cut him with a knife, didn't you?
And then you threw his fingers
and the knife off the Queensboro Bridge,
didn't you?
No.
You did it, Felix. You killed him.
You crushed his skull, didn't you?
- Oh!
- Didn't you? You hit him.
- I hit him.
- Louder.
- Say it louder!
- I killed him. I killed him.
- Think it'll stick?
- Why not?
I'll buy this one. I'd like to see Davis's
face when he reads the papers.
Leave it, Jilly.
You got the confession.
It's still got to stick in court.
Is there any doubt in your mind
how it's going to go in court?
Would you like to bet on
the chances of that fag?
Boy, three homicides in one week.
That ought to shake 'em up
at headquarters.
{y:i}(man) These pictures were taken
{y:i}as Sergeant Leland
{y:i}arrived with the suspect. Sergeant
{y:i}Leland is becoming known as one of
{y:i}the most colorful plainclothesmen
{y:i}in Manhattan. His running battle
{y:i}with Councilman Herbert Davis
{y:i}has been well-publicized.
- {y:i}(knock at door)
- {y:i}The information coming in
{y:i}about Felix Tesla
{y:i}is that he is a Canadian.
{y:i}His record included a dishonorable
{y:i}discharge from the Canadian army
- {y:i}and felonious assaults.
- Joe!
{y:i}The death of Theodore Leikman,
{y:i}the son of the department store owner,
{y:i}occurred in his apartment
{y:i}at 5 East 72nd Street.
{y:i}The violent and savage nature
{y:i}of his death
{y:i}brought speculation
{y:i}on his life and his background.
What a gorgeous little circus!
Everybody out to fry the little fag.
Including me.
I was even caught up in the fever.
Well, they said on the news that
it was a terrific piece of work you did.
It wasn't terrific.
It was routine.
Then why are you so upset?
Because he's a psychotic and they're
gonna burn him, that's why I'm upset.
But they have a court psychiatrist,
don't they?
Sure, they got a court psychiatrist.
But he's a front runner like
the rest of those bums down there.
Joe, what can I do?
Why did you come here?
I came here to ball.
Ain't that what you do the best?
Well, ain't it?
Hello.
Oh, hi, Joe. Hi...
Uh, this is Matt Henderson.
We went to school together. You know,
we're just sitting here chatting,
catching up on old times and everything.
- Matt, this is my husband, Joe Leland.
- Hi.
You want to join us?
No, I've got something to do.
See you.
Better comb your hair.
You're gonna get your picture taken.
Aw, nuts.
- Did he give you much trouble, Joe?
- Any trouble?
- Did he give you much trouble, Joe?
- Any trouble?
No comment.
I said no comment.
Hey, kid, where did he pick you up?
I've missed you.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.
- Is something wrong?
- No.
Karen...
I work with people every day.
That's my business.
Now, there's something wrong.
What is it?
Uh... nothing wrong.
There's someone else, isn't there?
No, no. No. No one.
Who is it, Karen?
Now, who is it?
Well, it's, uh,
just somebody from school.
You want a divorce?
No.
- Get him on the phone.
- What do you mean?
Get him on the telephone and tell him
you're no longer going to see him.
That's what I mean.
Joe, do you think this
is gonna solve everything?
Call him!
Uh, Jerry? It's Karen.
Uh... I don't want to see you anymore.
Yes, he's here, but that
hasn't anything to do with it.
It's what I want.
I-I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Hey! What the hell's
the matter with you?
So it's on again.
If you love this guy,
why the hell don't you marry him?
It wasn't him.
It was another man.
- I didn't hear you. What did you say?
- I said it was another man.
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- You can't talk to me
like one of your criminals. I have
a right to be with anybody I want to.
Oh, God.
I can't act like this with you.
I mean...
I just can't.
What's the matter?
You know what's the matter with me.
You've known it for a long time.
No, I don't know what you mean.
There's something wrong with me.
I wanted it to be all right.
Everything seemed so right and...
and then the bottom dropped out.
You know what I was like
when I married you.
You asked me once if...
if I'd ever been married or engaged.
I couldn't sustain a relationship.
I was scared to death of that.
Do you know what sex was like for me?
I'd-I'd... walk down the street
or go into a bar or anything.
Meet somebody. Anybody.
Someone I never knew before and...
and I'd have an affair with them.
It was the only way I could do it.
You're the only one
ever made me feel like a woman.
The man in the bar.
I never saw him before.
Telephone call?
A phony number.
I know all the clinical reasons for it. I'm...
I want to destroy
the only family I ever had.
I don't like myself very much.
Could you believe that...
in spite of it all...
I love you?
That's one thing I've always known.
You're the only chance I have.
Don't look away from me, Joe.
Don't look away from me.
Well, you balled me.
You feel better?
Don't I always with you?
Glad to be of service.
Joe, do you have to go?
I mean, why don't we have one of
those lazy days together we used to?
I mean, it's Sunday today.
I don't have to go to school.
I've got some work to do.
We can't do this anymore.
I mean, either we have to
forget each other...
or try it again.
No, Karen, it would cost me
too much to try again.
It would cost me too much.
- Is that all you've got on it?
- Yes, sir.
OK. Take it down to the desk
for a 61, will you?
Right.
Joe, Farrell wants to see you.
- What the hell does he want?
- He wants to see you.
- What's he got, another dirty job for us?
- I don't know what he wants.
He never tells me anything.
Joe, he's in there.
- Hey, man, it's Joe.
- Hi.
Hey, Joe.
What kind of cockamamie thing is this?
Congratulations, Lieutenant!
- I told you I'd do it for you, didn't I?
- Oh, you schmuck.
- I ought to rap you right in the mouth.
- I tried to talk them out it.
Can you imagine me
taking orders from you?
Come on, Joe.
I'll buy you a drink.
Congratulations, Joe.
It's great.
- Good luck, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, Tanner.
Well, you made it.
I guess anything can happen
if you get your name
in the papers often enough.
What'll it be?
Scotch, bourbon or beer?
- A little of each.
- Joe,
why don't you call Karen
and tell her to come over, huh?
You will walk through this door
a good Christian soul.
You will walk through this door
a good Christian soul.
In the name of God,
the Father Almighty who created you,
in the name of Jesus Christ, the son
of the living God who suffered for you,
in the name of the Holy Spirit
who has been poured forth upon you
in the name of the glorious
and Holy Mother of God,
the Virgin Mary, in the name of
St. Joseph, her illustrious spouse,
in the name of the angels
and archangels,
in the name of the thrones
and the dominations,
in the name of
the principalities and the powers.
In the name of the holy virgins
and of all the saints of God.
{y:i}(electrical charging)
{y:i}(race bell rings)
{y:i}(race bell rings)
{y:i}(woman screams) Help!
We can move in on
that heroin business today.
All right, make your buy.
Move in quick.
Those people can be dangerous.
OK. Come on, let's go.
What else?
The hookers are beginning to
come out on Third Avenue again.
They've got to make a living too.
The irate citizens
are starting to complain.
Well, scare 'em a little bit.
Maybe they'll go back uptown.
That thing with
the missing little Shaftel girl
is blowing up.
- No word yet, huh?
- No, nothing.
You check everybody in the apartment?
Yeah, we did.
Who are the people who are missing?
Anybody missing?
Boarder. Handyman.
Boarder, handyman.
Yeah, you concentrate
on the handyman.
The boarder's made a few trips
from time to time.
The handyman never left the place,
so it doesn't fit into pattern.
- You stick with the handyman.
- Right.
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm Norma Maclver.
What are you doing
in this den of iniquity?
I heard a statement your commissioner
made on television today.
He said that this organization exists
for the protection of the community.
That's generally true, yes.
Sit down.
I don't believe that this organization
does always protect the community.
That's an interesting statement,
if you'd like to explain it to me.
My husband's death.
Your husband's death?
Who was your husband?
Do you remember the case of the man
who fell from the roof of the racetrack?
Mm-hm. I was on vacation,
but I remember it, yes.
Well, wasn't there a coroner's
report and an autopsy, and...
- Yes, there was.
- What was the verdict?
Suicide.
And I take it
you didn't believe the verdict.
Look, my husband did not jump
from the roof of a racetrack
in the middle of the afternoon
in front of thousands of people.
No, you wouldn't
be expected to believe that.
There's some sort of conspiracy.
I don't know what it is, but there is.
Now why would you say
there's a conspiracy?
Why would you say
a thing like that, anyway?
The way people are frightened
of the case.
Who's frightened?
The coroner.
Now why would the coroner
be frightened?
He didn't invite me to the inquest.
When I saw him, he said it was suicide
and there was no need
to investigate further.
- Who else was frightened?
- Private detectives. I hire them.
They get into the case a little
and they drop it.
Anything else?
My husband's office was broken into.
The file cabinets were emptied.
- What else?
- My husband's notebook.
When the police returned it,
there were pages torn out.
You've gone into this thing
pretty thoroughly, haven't you?
Yes, I have.
I know I'm supposed to forget it.
People keep telling me
it's not gonna make any difference,
it's not gonna bring him back.
But I'm not gonna forget it.
- What was your husband's full name?
- Colin Maclver.
C-O-L-l-N?
And the names of
the private detectives?
First there was a man called Bloom,
then a man called Carter.
- Willie Carter?
- Yes.
I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.
- No need to thank me.
I'm going to come up with nothing.
But at least maybe
I can clear the mystery
of coroners and private detectives
who are frightened.
You'll hear from me.
What was that all about?
That was something very interesting,
Dave.
Remember Colin Maclver
who went off the racetrack roof?
Yeah.
Get a report on that thing for me,
will you?
And draw up a sheet on him,
and one on his wife.
- Her name's Norma.
- OK.
Dave, who was on that detail?
I think it was Curran.
Yeah, Curran.
What kind of a fellow was Maclver?
Well, there's a difference
of opinion on that.
Some people thought
he was quiet and reserved,
but he drove a very expensive sports car
and had a doll-like wife.
Anybody got any ideas
why he'd want to turn himself off?
Does anybody have an idea
what's on somebody else's mind?
That's true.
- What shape is his estate in?
- He left about 300,000.
Sheesh. That's a lot of brick.
- What did he do?
- CPA.
Not bad
for a Certified Public Accountant.
- Oh, he was very clever with money.
- That's an understatement.
I see in the inventory here
he had $900 in his wallet.
- Right.
- So that rules out robbery.
- He jumped.
- How do you know?
- That was the report.
- Anybody see him jump?
- No.
- Well, then how can we be so sure?
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.
If he was pushed,
somebody would've noticed it.
Not necessarily.
There was a lot of excitement
while the race was going on.
No, not necessarily.
Another thing.
It says here the man died at 3:35
and his wife wasn't informed
until 8:00 that night.
- What took you so long to tell her?
- I don't know.
One of the other men called her.
- What about the notebook?
- Notebook?
Yeah, a little black notebook.
We returned it to his wife.
You'd have had no reason to tear out
any pages of that book, would you?
Why would I tear any pages out?
I don't know. That's all.
- That's all?
- Yeah. I'll see you later.
{y:i}(overlapping talking)
- What was that?
- Shaftel girl.
Found her in a vacant lot,
raped and murdered.
Mother and father just left.
Picked up a suspect.
- About time.
- Yeah, Robbie's questioning him now.
- What's he like?
- 68-year-old man.
- Oh, the handyman, huh?
- Yeah. Frightened to death.
He threw up three times
in the car coming over.
{y:i}(Robbie) Where else did you take her?
I've got three witnesses that saw it.
Where did you take her?
Where did you take her?!
Nowhere, nowhere.
All right, all right.
Let's go over it again.
You took her to the candy store.
You bought her some caramel corn.
Where did you take her after that?
His answers
are falling all over themselves.
I think I'll have him
in a few minutes.
Why is he sitting there
without his clothes on?
Makes them easier to handle.
Stripping them makes them
feel more vulnerable.
I got the idea from the newsreels
of German concentration camps.
Dave, take him in the other room,
get him his clothes, will you?
You too, son.
You can go with him.
You son of a bitch!
What kind of a department
do you think we're running here?
All right, all right, don't blow your cool.
If I ever blow my cool, buster, I'll kick
your ass right out of this building.
I'm gonna get
my promotion too, Lieutenant.
You're gonna get a promotion?
- You've been on the force two years.
- So what?
My old man was on the force 25 years
and he never got a promotion.
That's what!
You can afford to play it big... now.
I'm gonna get promoted
the same way you've been,
and the only way to promotions
is with results.
What looks good to headquarters.
It's the only way you got ahead.
I'm gonna get the same thing.
Get out, Robbie.
Get out!
Where do you think you would have
been if they hadn't fried that little fag?
Don't press your luck, baby.
Get out of here.
Why don't you send the little bastard
back to pounding the pavement?
Because he asked me
some questions I couldn't answer.
Well, we did it the hard way.
Why can't he?
They don't do it the hard way
these days, Captain. It's unfashionable.
{y:i}(overlapping yelling)
- What's that?
- Agitators.
- What are you booking them on?
- We found something to book them on.
Do you think this is
gonna solve the problem?
You know damn well
it can only make it worse!
I have people to answer to.
I know the people
you've got to answer to.
Yeah, well, that bunch there,
they're swell.
Yeah, they throw Molotov cocktails
in our cars every night.
That's not hard to understand.
They do not like living in garbage cans.
And we know why
the garbage cans exist, don't we?
Because the ghetto-type housing
is the most profitable kind of housing.
- Joe! That's none of our business.
- Correct!
Our business is to sit on the lid of
those garbage cans. One of these days,
if somebody doesn't do something
about those garbage cans,
you'll see the goddamndest explosion
tear this nation right down the middle.
You never did realize
the responsibilities of this job, did you?
Haven't you ever been a little sick
about these responsibilities?
You'll find out.
Joe, I've got a pension
coming up in a few months,
and you know who's gonna be
the new head of this district?
It's all set. I'm telling you.
But there are just some things about
this job that you've got to learn to do.
You know, Joe, I feel sorry for you,
getting your brains beat in all the time.
Uh, this Maclver thing...
Yeah. This Maclver thing.
I know some people
who'd pay you to forget it.
Well, that's interesting.
And who are these people
who would pay for it?
I'll see that you get it.
Uh, who are they, huh?
Curran, one of these days,
you're gonna get your ass in a sling
for running around with these
kind of people and taking from them.
I'm doing all right.
Check, please.
I'll have you brought up on charges.
You know that, don't you?
Go ahead.
It's your word against mine.
I'll have you busted.
Have me busted.
If you have me busted,
you'll have to bust half the people in
the Department for being on the take.
You know, Joe, you think
you're better than the rest of us.
Wake up.
This was the last photograph
that was taken of him.
Do you know whether he was going to
meet anyone at the racetrack that day?
No, not that I know of.
Um, how was he with women?
I think he knew a lot of women.
Do you think he saw
any of these women
- while he was married to you?
- No.
- How do you know?
- I know.
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Karen.
Norma Maclver, Karen Leland.
- How do you do.
- Hello.
Uh, I'm having lunch with
some members of the board.
They're convinced
half the staff are Communists.
- Would you like to join us?
- No, thank you.
Hm.
Well, it was nice to see you.
- I didn't know you were married.
- We're separated.
What a lovely-looking woman.
Yes, she's lovely.
- Colin have lots of friends?
- Only one close friend. Dr. Roberts.
- What kind of a doctor?
- A psychiatrist.
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.
- Was Colin a patient of his?
- No. They liked each other.
- He lives next to us at the beach.
- Hm.
- Shall we go?
- OK.
- Hello.
- Lieutenant Leland, police department.
I'm Wendell Roberts.
Come on in.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- How are you?
- Fine.
I recognized you from
your pictures in the papers.
- I didn't know I was that famous.
- Oh, yeah.
The case of the mutilated homosexual
- was a hell of a thing.
- Yeah.
- Did you want to speak to Wendell?
- Yes, I did.
- Alone?
- That's what I had in mind, yes.
I'll be on my way. I'm over at Wendell's
as much as my own place.
How nice for the two of you.
I'll be around if you want me.
How about a drink?
What would you like?
Bourbon.
- Say, you've got a lot of plaques here.
- You make a speech, you get a plaque.
Tell me something, Doctor.
You a bachelor?
Mm-hm. I know you are.
Semi, anyway.
How did you know that?
Your wife came to me for treatment.
Didn't you know that?
No, I didn't know that.
Thank you.
- Did you treat Colin Maclver?
- No.
In your conversations with him, Doctor,
did you ever get any inklings
- that he might want to take his life?
- No.
Did he ever talk to you
about his business dealings?
- No, never.
- I don't believe you, Doctor.
I don't care what you believe. The
Maclver case is officially closed, isn't it?
- I've reopened it.
- Why?
Why not? Cheers.
Cheers.
She's an interesting girl, isn't she?
She's really far more vulnerable
than you might imagine.
And your investigation with its
constantly opening up of old wounds
isn't going to help any, you know.
There were certain papers
on Maclver's body, Doctor.
One of them had your name
on it regarding a business deal.
I had nothing to do with
Maclver's business affairs!
That was a fishing expedition, Doctor.
Why should you suddenly
become terribly upset
because I merely mentioned
you might have had
a business deal with him?
You're an interesting man.
Narrow, but interesting.
I always felt that about you.
What does that mean?
- As if I give a damn.
- Your relationship with your wife.
One of the most
remarkable women I've ever met.
You could have handled that
more intelligently, if I may say so.
A different kind of man could have
understood her problem.
Hm... Yeah, maybe
a different kind of man
would have understood her problem,
but I'm not civilized enough
to look the other way
while my wife's screwing other men.
It's childish, isn't it?
You know something?
You're full of crap.
You don't like psychiatrists
very much, do you?
I don't like the kind
that try to make people
- adjust to a sick world.
- It is a sick world, isn't it?
- Getting sicker by the minute.
- What do you suggest?
I think each person
knows what's important to him
and he should compromise for nobody.
Look, I'm telling you
to drop the Maclver case.
- Why?
- Because it can only bring harm
to any number of people,
including yourself.
I'm telling you something, Dr. Roberts.
If you've got anything to say to me,
you'd better tell me it damn quick,
because I'm gonna find out
the answers to your enigmas.
- Well, good luck.
- I'll see you again.
My pleasure.
Hey, that's a pretty good job.
Thanks. I'm a mess.
Well, I wouldn't say so.
Not exactly.
What did you talk about?
You, mostly.
- What did he say about me?
- He told me to lay off you.
That's none of his business.
Did Wendell tell you about
my unwholesome background?
- Your police record?
- You know about that?
Mm-hm. He didn't have to tell me.
- You know about the drug thing?
- Yep.
- I'd like to tell you about it.
- You needn't.
It was just one of those things
I had to try.
Why?
Curiosity. I don't know.
I didn't like it and I stopped.
Why are you telling me all of this?
I guess I care about what you think.
Norma, I'm trying to find out some things
about your husband's business.
Aside from the office,
would there be any other place
- he might have kept some papers?
- Yes, there's a room in the house.
Anybody know about this room?
No, I never told anyone
after they broke into the office.
What's the matter?
- Where's your telephone?
- Over there.
- What does "Rainbow" mean?
- Rainbow?
- Yes.
- I don't know.
My husband
never talked about business.
This is Leland.
Give me Schoenstein.
Dave, go to your apartment.
I'll be there soon
with some things I want you to see.
What does "Rainbow" mean?
Wish to hell I knew.
It's on nearly every one of these pages.
I tried to add up the figures.
They don't balance.
Did you get a load of
some of the names in here?
Some of the biggest names
in town.
Forms for corporations.
Why so many, Joe?
How about you go down to
the Hall of Records
and check out who pays their taxes,
who were the attorneys
who filed for them.
- It should take you a couple of days.
- OK.
I'm bushed.
I'm going home.
- Good night, Rachael.
- Good night, Joe.
Oh, can I fix you something
to eat before you go?
No, Rachael. I'm full.
- That stuffed derma was beautiful.
- Oh, thanks.
You want me to fix you something
in a bag to take home?
No, sweetheart.
- Good night.
- Good night, dear.
- David, how about you?
- Nothing.
- Not even a glass tea?
- Not even a glass tea.
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.
- 'Cause it's no trouble.
- No trouble.
Curran!
All right. Now you want to talk about it?
What are they afraid of?
They forced me to kill two men.
Where are the missing pages
from the notebook? Tell me about it!
Joe, if I tell you, I'm dead.
Hello.
Hello.
Great hours you're keeping these days.
{y:i}(chuckles) Don't tell me you're jealous?
Is it that girl in the restaurant?
She was eating you up with her eyes,
I could see that.
Hey, is it something serious?
You know,
I've been lying here all night long
trying to...
trying to think up a speech about
why we should get together again.
It doesn't work.
Yeah, it'd be pretty hard
to make that work.
You know...
what I always thought was
the most important thing in the world...
was to be valuable, you know.
I mean, not necessarily important,
just valuable.
I mean, you know,
to have people be pleased
when I did my job well,
whatever it was.
And to have them be grateful
I was around.
And I think I managed that pretty well.
I mean...
I'm good with the students,
Joe, I really am.
But that's not all that's important.
God, what's the matter with me?
Why can't I grow up?
Why is that thrill so important?
That...
deep, dirty thrill.
We know the reasons, Karen.
But knowing isn't enough, is it, Karen?
{y:i}(phone ringing)
- Yeah.
- Joe.
{y:i}I got the emmis on Rainbow, Joe.
{y:i}The stockholders
{y:i}are all members of
{y:i}the Borough Planning Commission.
OK, I'll be there.
I've got to go.
What happened in that garage?
Why did they try to kill you?
What's all that about?
Some very important people in the
neighborhood got their necks stuck out.
I'm gonna chop 'em off.
Will the Department let you do that?
We'll see.
Joe...
Take good care of yourself.
What is it, Joe?
I just discovered something else
about this guy Maclver.
He had a strange sense of humor.
"Rainbow" means an organization
that covers the town.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the
Borough Planning Commission.
You know how it's formed.
A couple of political payoffs.
An ex-mayor, councilman.
Representative of the business world.
Somebody for the religious community.
Rainbow. Covers the town.
Yeah, but why are they
selling land back and forth?
To make the prices rise.
Don't you understand?
The planning board recommends to
the city which land should be bought
for new housing, hospitals,
slum-clearance projects.
They're selling their own land to the city.
They buy it for a song.
They sell it to each other's corporations,
- making the price go up.
- Now you got it.
That's why there are no
new hospitals being built
and the old slums still stand.
By the time these guys
get through filling their pockets,
there ain't enough money
to build a birdhouse.
You know, there are half of the most
respected names in the borough here.
They're the ones always talking
about how the town needs improving.
Naturally.
I've been waiting a long time
to get those bastards. A long time.
And they judge other people's morals.
The thing we have to find is the link
between this and Maclver's death.
Hey, maybe he wanted to pull out
and maybe they didn't want him to.
- Maybe.
- {y:i}(Rachael singing)
- What's this?
- The lox came fresh this morning.
- Not now, honey!
- The bagels'll get stale.
Rachael, please, this is important!
Will you?
- You have to eat.
- Wait till evening, will you?
Will you look how he looks?
Now she's gonna cry.
Do you notice how many times
Dr. Wendell Roberts is mentioned here?
Now, he must be on the board
of at least ten organizations.
Dave, we're sitting on
something pretty dangerous.
I suggest you send Rachael
to her mother's for a few days.
What'll I tell her?
- Tell her you got a shiksa.
- Thanks a lot.
- Norma, it's Joe.
- Oh, hello, Joe.
Will you do me a favor,
no questions asked?
What is it?
I want you to see Dr. Roberts tonight,
keep him busy.
If you suspect Wendell of anything,
you're mistaken.
I'll be in his office,
so if he comes anywhere
near the building,
you call me right away.
All right. What time
do you want me to see him?
Uh, about 8:00.
- Joe, be careful.
- Don't worry, I will.
- Dave, do me a favor, will you?
- What?
Don't leave the house,
and if anybody rings the doorbell,
don't answer it.
That's just what I didn't want to hear.
And another thing:
You swallow your chewing gum
or you run out of cigarettes, call me.
You'll hear me all right
and I won't need a telephone either.
Joe, will you do me a favor?
You tell Rachael to go to her mother's?
Dave!
{y:i}(phone ringing)
Yes.
- Joe, he's coming up.
- {y:i}What?
He stopped at the building to pick up
some papers he has to have.
This was the first chance
I had to call you.
- Where are you?
- I'm downstairs. He's on his way now.
OK.
Close the door, Doctor.
Don't turn your back.
This is ridiculous.
Mm-hm.
You keep tapes of all your patients?
No, only sometimes.
Sometimes there are things
I don't want even a secretary to hear.
Maclver come to you clinically?
No, he didn't.
This is something else.
I'd like to hear that something else.
Play them.
Go on, play it.
- Joe, you don't want to do this.
- Yes, I do. Play them.
- You don't want to hear this, Joe.
- What's the matter, Doctor?
You afraid I'll find out
too much about Rainbow?
No, no. This is something else.
He talks about Rainbow only in passing.
You knew about Rainbow, didn't you?
Well, I didn't know
until he made these tapes.
Proceed.
{y:i}(Colin) My name is Colin Maclver.
{y:i}I'm 38 years old and...
{y:i}l- I don't know if I can...
- {y:i}if I can do it.
- {y:i}(Dr. Roberts) You have to.
{y:i}(Colin) I'm making this tape
{y:i}because I want to clear Dr. Roberts.
{y:i}He had nothing to do with Rainbow.
{y:i}I used his name.
{y:i}I'm making it also because I want
{y:i}Dr. Roberts to have something on me.
{y:i}I want him to use this
{y:i}in any way he sees fit,
{y:i}in case the patterns
{y:i}that led to the evening
{y:i}that I am going to relate
{y:i}manifest themselves again.
{y:i}Well, where shall I begin?
{y:i}Uh... shall I begin with that night?
{y:i}(Dr. Roberts) Go ahead.
{y:i}The tape's running.
{y:i}(Colin) Now, I had a beautiful wife.
{y:i}I was a success. Everybody
{y:i}thought it was just wonderful.
{y:i}(overlapping talking)
{y:i}(man) All right, party's over.
{y:i}On your way, friends. Outside.
- Nice car, Dad.
- Get out, fast.
- Don't rank me, Dad. I like the car.
- Get out of here, right now.
Hey, don't act tough with me.
You're a faggot. A dirty queer.
You little bastard, I could kill you
right now! Get out of here!
{y:i}(Colin) You said there was
{y:i}no such thing as a bisexual.
{y:i}You said there were only
{y:i}homosexuals without conviction.
{y:i}The thought of turning...
{y:i}of turning involuntarily into one of them
{y:i}frightened me
{y:i}and made me sick with anger.
{y:i}I went down there.
{y:i}I had heard about the waterfront.
{y:i}People giggle and make jokes about it.
{y:i}I had had only two experiences before - 
{y:i}once in college, once in the army.
{y:i}I thought I'd gotten it out of my life
{y:i}but I hadn't.
{y:i}I looked at them.
{y:i}Was this what I was like?
{y:i}Oh, my God.
{y:i}Twisted faces. Outcasts.
{y:i}Lives lived in shadows.
{y:i}Always prey to a million dangers.
{y:i}People don't realize
{y:i}what we go through.
{y:i}I was raised in a family
{y:i}that would not even admit
{y:i}that there was such a thing
{y:i}as a homosexual in this world.
{y:i}And here I was and I couldn't
{y:i}do anything about it.
{y:i}I couldn't stop.
{y:i}I thought if I could have just one night,
{y:i}I could get it out of my system.
{y:i}Just one more time.
Excuse me, fellows.
Hello.
Hello.
- What would you like to drink?
- Anything.
Moss, can we have a couple of
Scotch and waters, please?
- OK?
- Fine.
What's the matter?
Oh, you're a shy one, aren't you?
You're a closet queen.
You're the kind that thinks
he's fooling people. Forget it.
I knew you were gay
the moment you walked into the bar.
How could you know?
We know each other.
Something about the way you walked.
Something about the eyes.
{y:i}(yelling)
What's the matter with you?
I'll call the police.
Do you hear? Let go of me!
- Don't.
- Operator...
- Don't do that.
- Operator, I want to talk...
You bitch!
{y:i}(Colin) I killed one man,
{y:i}and another was about to die
{y:i}for something I did.
{y:i}When it was announced
{y:i}that Tesla was executed,
{y:i}I should have felt something, I know.
{y:i}I was responsible now
{y:i}for the deaths of two men.
{y:i}But I never did feel a great deal.
{y:i}You see, I felt more guilty about
{y:i}being a homosexual than a murderer.
He jumped from the roof of the track
a few weeks after he made this tape.
What do you suppose would happen
if we made these things public?
You know what would happen.
You're famous for the Leikman case.
It was international news.
They'd crucify you.
Maybe they should.
I knew that poor bastard
was a psychotic.
Hmph! He didn't know real from unreal.
But... I saw a chance for a promotion,
and also to get
the Department off the hook.
I wouldn't indulge in too much guilt.
After all,
there was the rest of the Department,
there were Tesla's lawyers, the judge.
There were the newspapers.
Oh, you're awful good, Doc.
It's easy to understand why you
do such a thriving business here.
You're awful good at getting people
off the hook, aren't you?
I think too many of us are on the hook.
I think that's part of the world's problem.
Is it?
I thought it was because
we don't face responsibility.
What about Norma?
You want her to find out
what Colin really was?
Do you want her to be haunted
for the rest of her life
by the lurid stories
the newspapers'll print?
No, I don't.
No. I don't.
What about Rainbow, Doc?
Do we forget about that, too?
What choice have we
under the circumstances?
What choice?
Lovely plaques, Doctor.
Pretty words too:
"Charity and compassion."
"For his very good work."
Hmph! Good work!
A man committed a murder
because he didn't want it to be known
he was a homosexual.
And you're going to keep quiet about it.
There are no decent hospitals
or houses up there
because other people
are lining their pockets
and you're gonna
keep quiet about that.
Kids growing up in the stink!
And you have a chance to help them,
regardless how small,
but you're not going to do
anything about it, are you?
And you?
What are you gonna do?
Here he is.
- Hey, Joe.
- Look this way, Joe.
They say you made accusations against
the Borough Planning Commission.
You know that some people
think you're off your rocker?
Tell them to talk to
the attorney general.
Come on, Joe.
Give us a statement.
Tell them to talk to
the attorney general.
Hey, Leland.
Farrell wants to see you.
Joe? I, uh...
- Well...
- Keep the faith, baby.
You damn fool.
You'll never win with these people.
- We'll see at the trials.
- You'll never win.
Ha. At least they're gonna
know they were in a contest.
People don't give a damn.
Rainbow'll be back in action
in six months.
Perhaps.
You know what the net result
of this whole thing is going to be?
The Department will get hurt.
No, Tom, I'd never hurt
the Department, you know that.
This'll take you off the hook.
You could have gone all the way.
You could have made chief.
No, I knew I could never make it.
Tell me one thing:
Why are you doing this?
Because I was a good cop.
I saw things that terrified me.
And I thought I was above it all.
But I wasn't.
Now I want out,
because there are things to fight for,
and I can't fight for them while I'm here.
That's why, Tom.
When I heard about it yesterday,
I hated you.
I didn't believe a word of it.
Then I thought about it.
I knew it.
I knew it was all true.
What are you going to do?
Well... I spent 20 years
of my life with the Department.
Now I'm gonna start living for myself.
Are you going back to her?
I don't know.
It's not too easy to rub out
all those years in your life.
Good night, Joe.
Good night, Norma.
