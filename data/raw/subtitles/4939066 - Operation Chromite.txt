The name of the typhoon is Jane.
Jane
It's a beautiful name.
Ready to sabotage
Youngdok Jangsadong, Gunsan and Samcheok
will be held on September 12th and 14th.
Can I say one word?
Tell me.
Many casualties can occur
Do you still want to do it?
On June 25, 1950, "North Korea" was a member of the Soviet
Union Military support is given to take a surprise surprise.
On June 27, 1950, President Harry of the United States of
America Truman directed US troops into the Korean Peninsula,
Douglas MacArthur
Appointed UN Commander-in-Chief.
However, 'South Korea' has not been able to
The entire country will be taken away.
Contemplating counterattack Douglas
MacArthur, United Nations Commander-in-Chief
To overturn the premises
Put in eight intelligence units
A week ago
Let's light it.
They fought for their country.
I do not see the reality of this book.
Our thoughts are all from this book.
The protagonist goes to
the end and is shot dead.
I am against the blue sky.
Long
Shawlhoff. He wrote the blue sky
beautifully in all the words of the world.
That's a lie.
Stop talking and start speaking.
Because of the honor
When a person dies and sick,
Did the sky look beautiful?
Is not that right?
Nam-Chul Park
Incheon is where we came from.
It is Ryu Changchun, chief of Operation
Incheon District Defense Command.
Park, Nam Chul
Your Commander of Defense
is waiting for you.
I drove by car.
Due to the spiritual struggle
of the Korean People's Army
Incheon was liberated
Long live the Incheon!
Citizens in Incheon!
Incheon has been liberated
Let's move forward with one accord
for victory of national liberation
Your peace has begun
I can not afford it.
This is insult.
Come on!
Request additional troops in France
Continue until you are.
If I refuse,
I'll talk to President O'roll.
Have you been contacted in Australia?
Are you going to send an aircraft carrier?
Are you saying?
Find out now! Do not even think
about reporting before you know it!
Yes!
General
Defend your position in Wolmido
It is an intelligence that builds.
The commander is Commander Rim,
The construction of the defense zone is not
Pyongyang It's under the leadership of Lim Jin-jin.
It is Park Nam-cheol.
Lim Jin-jin.
What about the Nakdong River front?
Pivadadya
Yes.
Current status of our troop deployment.
Here in Incheon 226
Independent National Guard
This is the second artillery unit
of the 918 Coastal Sports Corps.
2048 Independent Training Centers, 231
Coastal Training Units, 487 Training Units
The geographical characteristics of Incheon make it
possible for enemy troops to enter the land route
Gimpo, Siheung, and Hwaseong.
Here, we have distributed tanks and
one artillery unit, respectively.
Topographically, Incheon Harbor
is made up of 6 Meda's sea walls.
I can never come up with a gear
When the Americans crawl to the
shore, what are they gonna do?
There is only one waterway
that can enter Incheon Harbor.
Even if only one landing gear is
stranded here, the ramp is blocked.
They block the ramp, tie their feet,
All you need is 76 prefolded.
That is all
General Lee Boo-oh
I can not do anything
with the 76 pre-rollers.
When the landing gear
comes in, it's all over.
You have to stop at the
sea before you come in.
Kikago
I'm not talking about a mine.
You did not show?
The mine
I've got it all right on the boat.
If so, did you mark it well on the map?
Bring me a mine.
That's
I will report directly to you.
To the Supreme Commander Comrade.
When did the censorship take place?
I got off the bench tomorrow.
Park Dong-moo
I'll take the lead. Well?
I was in trouble,
Just sleep on the bed.
Hey... Inchon has become
like this in two months.
Young master
Let me have this thing.
I have no hands?
Do not call me Gigolo.
It's already been over.
Our home is full of chickens.
Have been sent
Send this, too.
Yes
This is Kelo, Seo Jin-cheol in Incheon.
It's connected to the Kello unit.
Tell them to locate the mine.
Securing the mine is a priority.
- Do not choose the means and the way!
- Okay
This is General MacArthur's instructions.
That palmy lighthouse?
Grudge
(Rockyard)
This is the Park Nakcheol
midrid from Supreme Command.
This is the municipal hospital.
Be careful of everyone.
This comrade is willing to watch
over us for the time being.
Is not that right?
Nam-Chul Park
When I was at Moscow's communist university
Professor Michiko was my idol.
He was also my idol.
That Professor Michiko
When he shot his beautiful
sister, Sonya, with a pistol
At that time, our students
were cheering together.
The case?
Because my brother
believes in Christianity.
He shot his pistol three times
in the head and killed him.
What do you think about
the Han Chae Sun family?
If a Han dong uncle believes in an indigenous
god of Israel, then what can he do?
Let's dry.
If you do not mind, why do not you listen?
But how about my uncle ..
No, I do not know how to get my uncle...
You can kill him.
But how do believers
follow the party's ideals?
Religion like opium should be rooted.
What does Park Namcheol think about?
Keynote
The individual's share
Nam-Chul Park
Is there a God?
Do you see God? Well?
Where is God?
I already said there is
no god in the party.
Is not that right?
What is the name of your code?
If you say anything like
that, you're fired.
Rim Dongji
(Red Dostoevsky)

It's a private room.
It is only a long time.
Defender Commander Comrade
What happened?
Park Namcheol middle class
sent by Supreme Command?
I know Yes.
Are you well?
Park Nam-cheol has a scar on
the left side of his neck.
That's it.
I do not need to brush my hair today.
Good.
That's how it is.
I accept. Gift hire
Why did not I...
I did something...
I will pass it on to you.
Let's joke about it.
Oh yes!
Hooray for General Kim Il Sung
General Kim Il Sung!
This is a fuss.
Even if you put it out, do not leave it!
I do not know which way.
Why do not you just come
over to the minesweeper?
Do not be ridiculous.
Do you know where the keys are up and down?
It's urgent inspection!
Stop acting all!
(USS Wisconsin)
Defender Commander Comrade!
This is going to see me coming up.
No number of mines.
I check to see if it has been
properly laid for every channel.
Please do it!
Lee Bo-woo, Park Dong-moo
There's a lot of interest in mines, huh?
Huh? How are you so obsessed with the mine?
Did not I understand what I came here for?
I told you
I have to report directly to Pyongyang.
Would you like to see it?
Commander comrade
Have you made a mistake?
If you only talk about the mine,
you will take out the pussy.
I'm sorry.
There are so many spies on every side.
For landing operations
Send disturbing information
In particular,
Gunsan area
To make sure it's eavesdropped
Spread a lot of false information.
Yes
Something?
Mine information yet
Failed to acquire.
I need more time.
Without removing the mine
The narrow channel of Incheon
Can not pass.
Give me an order.
It's an order...
To God
MacArthur has time
Tell them you need more.
Lieutenant colonel
September 6 UN troops gather in Kobe Port!
It is full-bodied that it spreads the firing
after coming to the Nakdong River front
Where the hell are you coming from?
Leader!
We're in the rim.
Where do you think McCarthy
is coming from? Huh?
Incheon is obvious
We have to go to Pyongyang
and convince the nurses.
Lack of one
I know Park Namcheol was a member of the Information
Administration during his prime minister's term.
Have you heard anything?
What did you get from the
Soviet Union or the Civic?
Do you think it is not Incheon at the top?
I think McCarthy is...
It's coming to Incheon.
Do you know the probability of success in Incheon
landing operations that the USFK is noticing?
1/5000?
Impossible?
Boiling
Why did you come to Incheon
with a low probability?
Because I want to be a hero?
After the old man, Normandy,
on the Korean peninsula?
The Pentagon must have put a shit on me.
I'm going to catch an old dog.
To send out the Three Musketeers
The Three Musketeers!
Who is Athos?
- I'll be Portos.
- I would not be Aramis.
- Your generals!
- Then I'm Athos.
Let's laugh!
Where do you think the Allied forces
in Tokyo Port will strike first?
Wonsan, Jumunjin, Gunsan, Incheon
Multi-colored film
Hundreds of airplanes in Gimpo
There is a high possibility of
dropping Rock Hassan units.
I rather break the expectation
- I think he could beat Pyongyang directly.
- Great.
How about everybody except for Incheon?
Incheon tide
It's the worst in the world
At an average of 9 meters
Up to 11 meters.
In ten minutes
My feet will be tied.
What about the harbor?
To turn the ship
It's too narrow.
So I have three paths
I developed it.
Red, green, blue
I'll pass it safely
The landing place is
There's only one place.
Here!
Landing is not a problem
My midge has a tank
I will swallow it whole.
Besides, What channel
Its high coastal cliffs
Are you up?
In that strong wave!
It's simple
I'll use a ladder.
A ladder?
More importantly,
75,000 troops Moving it.
Until sunset In just an hour
The lighthouse at Palmido
I have one
By recapturing it
I'll turn on the lights.
You two do not know
I have a heart.
Go back to Washington.
Let me tell you this good news.
Your Excellency!
General MacArthur.
There's nothing to worry about.
We have a ladder
There's a lighthouse.
Instead of going to Busan
75,000 Allied Forces
Send it to Incheon.
Why?
For General MacArthur.
I have a ladder and a lighthouse!
I'll have a toast.
For a successful operation
Vandenberg, in this war
You want to win?
The general I want to ask.
What do you think?
In Busan, soldiers I'm dying.
The general's solution is
Are you on a suicide mission?
What is Busan? Suicide.
Not the enemy is strong
We hit a weak spot.
Break the supply path
Starving to death!
Does McCarthy go around?
The total force is gathered
in the Nakdong River front.
Are you pushing the head over there?
Are they hers?
Do you want to go to the fireball?
Hey hey hey
The US Secretary of Defense
Incheon has only one-fifth
of the chance of success?
5,000 to 1!
The probability that this operation
will succeed It's 5,000 to 1.
Most of all
It's a terrible military operation.
That's right.
If you get tired,
Supreme Commander Comrade!
Do you know what Mecadder is now ignoring?
I fight to win
Chromite operations only
The way to victory Oh.
Chromite operation...
The operation name is cute.
The general intentionally
I delayed reporting.
We are from Washington
Waiting to come
It is not enough to insult us.
He insulted the president
of the United States.
And there is no alternative
Only one operation.
Only one operation!
Why?
Why Incheon Are you insisting?
What Maker wants now?
President of the United States.
So I need a miracle to penetrate
one fifth of a thousand.
I'm sure it will come to Incheon because
What do you want?
What I really want What is it?
Two days after the war broke out,
To look at the situation
I've found Korea in secret.
Then left alone in the trenches
I met a child soldier.
It looked less than 16 years old.
Without a gun It was a man.
After all retreat.
I can understand I did not.
I asked him why he had not retreated yet.
The child solder answered
There was no order to decline to retreat.
In his courage I am impressed
Whatever you want
He told me to listen.
In a sparkling eye
The boy soldier said.
Give me a shot and enough ammunition!
Give me a gun and enough bullets.
I have a feeling of homogeneity.
We were the same soldiers.
With a single goal of victory
Two soldiers
I decided that time
I have this country of child soldiers
I'm sure you will.
We will secure mine laying ground
by 21:00 on September 10th.
Not in the weapons warehouse,
not in the archives,
Was not it in the mine operation room?
Welcome to
When does Bae Song appear in Bae Song?
Did you bring your umbrella?
Hello?
Navy spy units, Captain supervisor.
It is Choi Seok-jung, a
member of Incheon Kellogg.
Sit this way.
What can I do for you?
I'll get charts.
Please arrange transportation.
When is it?
Tomorrow is midnight.
Okay
Then, after passing the sea chart, gather
for the closing school of Youngheung
The guide led by Captain
Seo Jin-cheol will wait.
Be careful,
Rim is a persistent person.
Come in.
Why do not you sleep
that…
Do not you want to go to
see your little kitten?
My wife is selling herbs at
dawn market in front of you.
When the operation is
over, the war is over.
Hold on a second.
I know
Be a comfortable night.
We get infiltrated during the day.
Steel rod
Be precise about the guard's
turnover and shift time
South Korea disperses the sentinels' eyes.
In the meantime, the joining country penetrates
through the window into the office of Rimgijin
Song Sang-deok and
Yang-gwan-gang have more weapons
Dae-su and Chun-dong search for a
car and search for a waiting place.
In the meantime, I'm going to lure
Lim Jin-jin and Ryu Changchun.
Now, match the clock.
Current time 16:38
After securing the road
I get out quickly and safely

Would you like some tea?
Thanks to the generals
I'm in trouble
The President has
He's seriously considering it.
But one thing
You want to clarify
Your intervention in the Chinese
You do not want to.
As I reach this line
This war It must end.
On a line drawn by a politician
It's not a war to end
I can not agree.
General's direct supervisor
It's the President's order.
Why does General
Are you stubborn?
Why the President Foolish?
You want a local?
I can not do anything about it.
Communist I can not take root.
Politicians I do not know what

victory is not guaranteed
Getting soldiers out Immoral!
I'm really curious.
In Chromite Operation
What is your intention?
Through this
What are you trying to get?
Do you want Incheon to become
Normandy of the General?
With a brilliant achievement as a stepping
stone To challenge the Grand Prix?
I want to be president
Using Incheon?
For over 50 years
I devoted my life to the battlefield.
I'm Douglas MacArthur.
He wins in the war.
To teach me
Do not try to analyze it.
Why did you volunteer for this operation?
Why did you volunteer for this operation?
What..
I wanted to protect my mother.

Let me meet the captain of the
Kelo Division in Incheon.
Okay,
Who?
Choi Seok-jung
this
Did you find this?
I also
He was once a communist.
There is one phrase I liked at the time.
Is the root rotting and the fruit opening?
It was a good phrase to motivate students.
By the way
One day my comrades grab a bourgeois
After you drag me to the
azit and grab me a gun
He told me to kill him.
But he was my father.
I do not know what to do. I'm hesitating.
My closest friend shot my father.
I could not stop my father's
death while I hesitated.
My friend who shot my father saw
me with a face full of faith.
He said that ideology is
more profound than blood.
Mr. Chae is now being deceived.
What your uncle is doing now...
Light!
All right.

I am Seo Jinchul, the director
of the Kalo Inchon area.
The landing operation
was decided to Incheon.
Operation begins three days later.
Sea charts have disappeared.
You need to locate the mine.
It's easy. It's a little different.
How else?
Can not you see we're getting bitten now?
Please stop it!
Are only your people now blooming?
We're all the same.
What the fuck!
We've only been five.
Stop! stop

Even if only one survives, it must be done.
Because Ryu Changchun is a mystery
fence, he will know everything.
Let's kidnap Ryu Changchun Lee

Hospital room is here
After catching Ryu Changchun Lee, we go out
through the first floor of the basement
So wait for the car at the back door.
The People's Army will be here from here.
Let me be the ambassador in this area.
Finally, we have to stop this place.
This is the most important part.
I'll stop there.

Leave the car.
There's a lot of work.

Take this opportunity to increase
your chances of becoming a co-worker.
The ideology is not as thicker than blood.
I'm a little sleepy.
Where is it?
I need to take an x-ray.
There's bullet fragments left.
Fine.
I can do it alone.
I have something to say.
Can you wait here for a minute?

Ryu Changchun arrived very well
They say they have all the

It's our next assignment.
We leave Palmi at 22:00.
But the resistance of the
enemy will be terrible.
To be prepared for battle.
So, can we just turn on
the palm lighthouse?
Yes,
Why?
How many People's Army troops will
be in the palm-doo lighthouse?
There will be about 20 squads in two units.
Ryu Changchun seems to be talking
about the fortress of Wolmido
I'll check it out.
Look, look over there.
Leader! Come this way!
Everybody gather in the square!
Everybody gather in the square!
Soon, I will hold a People's Court trial!
Please listen carefully!
I will take the red flag of revolution.
Gather everyone!

I went to see my mother.
I can not say hello in the
distance, I just came.
I could not leave my mother behind.

I wanted to bring it to the end...
Sorry.
I will keep you from heaven.
I'm coming back.
You did...
Guys, boys, pops. Look for me, huh?
Come on, father.

Whether you're alive or dead or alive.

Education
Study!
My birthplace is Masan in Gyeongnam Province.
I grew up in Incheon since I was a child.
I have a good vision and
I have a good shot.
The rice is also good.
I have someone to guard against.
Now I want to do something meaningful.
I wonder if I could use it to save the technology
country I learned while doing bad things.
All the families were killed.
It was an independent family.
Will not we have to keep the country?
If you give a lot of rice,
I have a lot of kittens.
It has become very fertile
