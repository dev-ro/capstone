To my mother...
The red Istanbul
By ExYu-Subs
Istanbul, 13 May 2016
- Welcome, Mr. Orhan.
- Thank you.
Mr. Deniz wanted to welcome you
but an urgent meeting came up.
I should've gone to the hotel first.
No, you shouldn't. Mr. Deniz
wants to see you right away. Please.
Mr. Orhan, don't trouble yourself.
Wait here.
Make yourself at home.
Something to drink? Tea, coffee?
No, thank you.
Why are you standing there?
I told you to take that upstairs.
Careful.
If you live in the past,
you miss out on the present.
How's Istanbul?
As you left it?
- Well.
- Are you fired?
Not really.
We can start work right away.
I have so much to ask you.
My head's buzzing with questions.
Good thing you came.
- Your room's ready.
- No need. I'll go to my hotel.
Look, tell you what.
Why don't you take a shower and change?
Then let's talk some more, huh?
Welcome.
You'll make me mess up.
Imagine your guest's face
when he wakes up in the morning...
To see all the furniture
gone from the house.
You know what we should do?
Whisk his bed away from under him
while he's asleep, huh?
He won't know what's hit him
in the morning.
Only you would think of
having guests to stay...
On the very eve of
clearing out the house.
Just look at me.
Mum, really.
Does that bother you?
We've had a ton of people
through this house...
They've seen everything.
Fights, quarrels...
All but murder, in fact.
I don't like the idea of a stranger
seeing us leave this place.
Mum, Orhan.
Welcome, Mr. Orhan.
Come in please.
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.
Thank you.
My son says you live in London.
Yes, I've been there for years.
- Did you grow up in Istanbul?
- Yes, in Kalamis.
Kalamis.
The old Kalamis is all gone now.
Its famous 'sweet serenity'
and everything else. Really.
I feel rather like you, Mr. Orhan.
A stranger in my own country.
I don't go out any more.
Istanbul survives only in memories
Deniz always wants to be right.
Be smart and let him think
he gets his way whatever.
- What does he know about writing books?
- Mother.
- Yours was medium-sweet, wasn't it?
- Yes.
Thank you.
Hey, Orhan.
I want to say something.
So you...
You'll meet characters from the book.
The real people, though.
So when you meet them...
You may have questions but...
Please don't ask them, OK?
Ask me. Deal?
Sure. I came here for you.
Whatever you say.
Oh, and...
I want us to be alone.
You, me, the book.
We'll work more productively here.
I can drop you at the hotel tomorrow.
Huh? What do you say'?
I'd prefer the hotel.
But OK, whatever you say.
- You have a dog?
- No.
Why do you ask?
You're saying
you don't want to be tied down.
What breed is yours?
A stray.
Tommy.
Tommy from the book.
Like your dog as a kid.
Tommy.
Always Tommy.
Neval.
Yes.
Orhan.
- He's been dying to meet you.
- Really?
Why were you dying to meet me?
To see how accurately
Deniz describes you in his book.
What kind of book have you written?
Same stuff as always.
I like mixing fact and fiction.
You know howl like to embellish things.
Must've been tough on you.
So how does he describe me?
Oh god.
As his best friend.
They meet really young.
Neval's studying fine ans,
he's studying film.
She becomes a restoration artist
at which point he moves to Europe.
He thrives internationally as a director
but they never lose touch.
They exchange thousands of letters.
Come on! Not thousands.
They always spend holidays together.
At the summerhouse.
They also have a fling there.
- Did I put that in, too?
- A fling?
Are you sure it was a fling?
Neval, OK. I guess I put it in.
It was just one night, yes. I mean...
It meant the world to me, though.
But that's unfair.
You started with a 1-0 advantage.
You know almost everything about me.
And I know almost nothing about you.
I know the Neval of Deniz's book,
not you.
Besides, authors use their characters
to talk a little about themselves.
In storybooks, too?
Deniz mentioned it.
The idea of his editor being famous
for a storybook he wrote so young...
Really amused him.
But he said
you wrote nothing more after that.
Is that really true
or was he being mischievous?
Are London parties as dull as this?
Are all Deniz's friends like that?
He doesn't have any.
Apart from me.
All the people you see here...
- Are just admirers.
- Or lovers.
Especially ex-lovers
convinced they are irreplaceable.
Sure. You're the only one
who's irreplaceable.
The only person
Deniz takes seriously.
The only one
he takes criticism from.
Doesn't he mention that in his book?
Mr. Oğuz.
So you've met Orhan.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Oğuz is our host.
He's also a superb writer.
His books are always bestsellers.
You must read him.
If the zeitgeist interests you, that is.
Have you read him?
I know the name,
but haven't had the chance.
Here.
- Orhan.
- No, thanks.
All light.
- Could I have some water?
- Right away.
We've actually met before.
Your face is familiar.
Maybe a slightly younger version
with more hair.
We probably met at a party.
Before you left Turkey.
Are you staying here long?
No, not long.
Until I finish Deniz's book.
So you don't want to stay.
I guess
you find us disagreeable.
I think this city
finds me rather disagreeable.
Istanbul is a total slut.
She doesn't turn anyone down.
Let's drink to your return.
Mr. Oğuz, I've given up alcohol.
An abstainer, huh?
I never trust people
who don't have bad habits.
Before coming here I spent three days
holed up at home watching your films.
In your writing
there's no narrative arc.
Granted, in both the films and the book
there's emotion, excitement.
But in the book
you're kind of all over the place.
Thanks, sweetie.
Thank you.
See you again.
Someone mil an ambulance.
MY Papers.
MY Papers.
MY Papers.
My... My... My papers.
Brother, my papers.
It's all blown away.
Don't let the bastards steal them.
I picked up so much today.
It's gone.
It's all gone.
Brother...
Give me a hand...
Picking up the paper.
So? What shall we do?
For the book?
My book, my films, everything I do...
It's all just a sham.
My life is a sham.
You know that, don't you?
Do you really believe that,
for goodness sake?
You know who you are.
And why you write.
You also know
the strongest pan of your book.
Where, for goodness sake?
Yusufs funeral
and everything else involving Yusuf.
Fuck you.
The ritual washing of his body.
His death.
As I see it,
Yusuf is a phenomenal character.
I love him.
I tell you, he's the strongest character
in the book.
No two ways about it.
What do you like most about Yusuf?
That he's a loser?
I mean, is that it?
I see Yusuf
as a moth drawn to the light.
That's so dull.
So damn dull.
That's how I mote him.
But he isn't like that.
There must be a grain of truth.
For just this much truth
I would change entire lives
of all my characters.
I mote it.
I'm the director.
I decide who they are
and how they act.
Got it?
The angel you imagine...
ls sometimes the devil.
And sometimes the devil you imagine...
ls suddenly an angel.
OK. pal?
Orhan.
Orhan.
Life.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Ali.
Deniz's big brother.
Good to meet you. Orhan.
So, Mr. Orhan?
What does my brother write about
in his book?
Childhood memories.
ROrhances, friends.
Family. That kind of thing.
Great.
So we stand to be publicly embarrassed.
He doesn't say much about you,
don't worry.
You're in a paragraph or two, of course.
Of course.
Why would he write about me
staying here to look after mother...
When he was cruising around
London, Paris and Rome?
Deniz has it easy.
He pays the bill when it suits him.
As if money solves everything.
- It makes me sick.
- But when you want money for yourself...
It doesn't make you sick.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, Ms. Süreyya.
Good morning.
- Not that story again, darling?
I want a loan, mother.
Is that a crime?
Hello. Good morning.
- Good morning.
- How are you, Ms. Süreyya?
Good morning.
I'm Zeynep,
Mr. Deniz's assistant.
- We met at the party last night.
- Ah, yes. I remember.
- Zeynep, have coffee with us.
- Shall I sit over there?
I have the photos
Mr. Deniz wanted for his book.
Istanbul back in the 60s and 70s.
Thank you.
Is Mr. Deniz not around?
I expect he's asleep.
Still?
I'll wake him or he'll be annoyed.
Not so fast. I'll do it.
All right. You wake him then.
He didn't tell me to, though.
I'll take the rap for it.
Mr. Orhan.
I'd like to show you my work.
The Fish Within Me
and Judas Blossom Ladies'.
I've never been jealous of Deniz.
But he's so well-connected.
You'd think he could've helped me.
Would it be so hard, say, to use
a painting of mine in one of his films?
Of course
the originals are something else.
Well, they're different.
- Interesting.
- I'm so happy you like them.
Mr. Deniz isn't in his mom.
His phone's off, too.
You see if the boat's in the boathouse.
- I'll look in the garage.
- OK.
- Any news of Mr. Deniz?
- No, none.
Have you called his friends?
Clubs, bars, places he often goes.
I don't know...
The police, hospitals.
No! We never thought of that,
Inspector Colombo.
What's wrong, Sultan?
I want to ask you a favour.
Will you tell a small lie for me?
When we gel to the island
and find Deniz...
Will you tell him
that coming here was your idea...
That you need to crack through
your work here and get back ASAP?
There's no telling with him.
He might make a scene.
OK.
Deniz.
Deniz.
Deniz.
Neval, we'll never pan.
Farewells are for those who love with their eyes;
those who love with their hearts never part.
Deniz mote that in his book.
He talks about Yusuf, too, of course.
About that summer.
About two kids
innocently discovering love.
Deniz is like that.
When he wants people...
He'll embrace them
or push them away at will.
THOUGHTS ON DEATH
PREVENTABLE MASSACRE
I have lost everybody
Nobody has lost me
Bemuse nobody has owned me
Because I have belonged to nobody.
Deniz does this
when he's writing films.
He collects
all the material he can find.
Must be a heavy film.
Is Deniz that unhappy?
Aren't we all?
Good evening.
- Forgive me, I'm late.
- Welcome.
Thanks.
You didn't find anything, did you?
Unfortunately not.
- Please, have a seat.
- That's Deniz's place.
- Deniz sits there.
Mr. Orhan, sit at the end there.
Let me introduce
our dear family friends.
Betül and Güzin.
The famous aunties.
Glad to meet you.
He's working with Deniz.
On his book.
A man of culture and intellect.
Congratulations.
Thanks to Deniz
I know a lot about you.
I hope it isn't all good.
Well.
In his book...
Deniz describes this house
as full of women.
A harem of sorts.
You had a big part in his first 10 years
with his father not around.
Is Deniz writing a book now?
The boy's insatiable.
Nothing satisfies him.
Nothing is enough for Deniz.
Ms. Betül,
Deniz is especially fond of you.
Of course he is.
I bought him ice cream
at Baylan Patisserie every week.
Then when you found someone handsome...
You'd send the boy home in a taxi.
At least I had the men one at a time.
Süreyya, remember the three young men...
Pounding on the door one day
to see Güzin?
What slander!
Say that again and I'll sue you.
I'm so scared!
Süreyya threw you out of the house,
remember?
Who are you?
You haven't changed a bit, Süreyya.
Always opening your home to strangers.
How can you sleep at night?
What if he's a serial killer?
Or if he strangles you?
Do I look like a serial killer'?
Then how about staying with us tonight?
That way we can look into
who you really are.
No one is what they seem.
Don't the neighbours of serial killers
always say...
'Who'd have thought?
He was such a decent man.'
You come here one evening
and the next morning Deniz disappears.
Quite a coincidence, isn't it?
The truth
You arrived and Deniz disappeared.
What are you trying to say?
I have nothing to do
with Deniz's disappearance.
So you know Deniz has disappeared.
Ladies and gentlemen...
Everything is clear as day.
We don't know this gentleman
but there's no denying he's handsome.
But I know Deniz like a book.
They've made a deal.
They must have a secret retreat.
Who's to say
they haven't been together before?
Have you made a deal, huh?
Are you an accomplice?
What kind of game
are you playing with Deniz?
"Are You serious?
Look, I only came here to work.
Yes, if a family member disappears...
It may not be nice
having a stranger around.
But it wasn't even my idea
to stay here.
I'm sorry.
You'd better excuse me.
Enjoy your dinner. Good night.
Don't be offended.
We've a right to be suspicious.
Orhan Bey, we're only joking.
Didn't you realize?
Please sit down. For me.
Is it not a custom here to knock?
Is it so urgent?
Yes, it is.
- Yes?
- We told the police Mr. Deniz is missing.
To keep it from the media Ms. Süreyya
called an old police chief contact.
As you know,
with Mr. Deniz being a celebrity...
The media descend like vultures.
So they questioned us here.
But you must go to the police station.
I told them everything you said.
I'm saying that for the sake oi consistency
so you don't contradict yourself.
Why would I do that?
Well.
You never know with police business.
- We drank a lot that night.
- Mr. Orhan.
Louden
We drank a lot that night.
That's why I don't know.
I mean, I can't remember much.
You know, when you drink a lot-
No, I don't know.
I don't drink.
How does drinking a lot affect you,
Mr. Orhan?
What happens?
Do you not remember what went on?
Do you Pass out?
Do you do things you regret later?
No, nothing like that.
But, I don't know...
I'm a little muddled about that night.
I hadn't drunk for a long time.
I wasn't drinking at all.
That night was the first time.
It may be why I remember nothing.
I guess I crashed out in the garden.
Didn't Mr. Deniz wake you up?
How could he
let you sleep there outside?
I think he called me once or twice.
Excuse me?
He called me once or twice but...
I don't know. It's all a blur.
Maybe I was dreaming.
Are you sure you've told me everything,
Mr. Orhan?
I've told you everything I remember.
Halis.
- Yes?
- How was the fish restaurant?
- Amazing.
- Always listen to your boss.
The best fish is the boss's wish.
OK, fix an evening there with Selda.
Whatever you say.
What's going on?
I presumed we were done.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I suggest you stick around
for a few days.
I want to go back to London.
Better if you don't for the time being.
Look, I came here
to work with Mr. Deniz...
And he isn't around.
I don't see why I should stay
given that I can't work.
What's the rush, Mr. Orhan?
Why do you want to leave the country
so fast?
Are you accusing me of something?
No.
But you were the last person
to see Mr. Deniz.
So you're a key witness.
Think carefully about that night.
Sometimes a word is enough
to uncover a clue.
A sentence.
Try to remember.
Maybe see you again in a few days.
Can I have my ID back?
Here you are.
Can you pass forward a fare for one?
Can you pass on a fare for one?
Excuse me, a fare for one.
Mister, can you pass forward
a fare for one?
A fare for one.
Can I gel out here?
OK. Can I get a fish sandwich?
What do you want from me, asshole?
Get out of here.
Get out of here!
Fuck Off!
FUCK you!
You found the place OK?
Sure, no problem.
What did the police ask?
What Deniz and I did that night.
As the last person to see Deniz,
I'm told I'm a key witness.
But I don't think I was.
I heard Deniz calling me in my sleep.
There was someone with him.
Who?
I've no idea.
I just saw what he was wearing.
So did you tell the police?
Uh-uh.
I thought it was a dream.
I only realized it wasn't when I saw
the guy there after my interview.
And then I followed him.
What was he like?
My height, 40 or so, brown hair, thin.
He had this long hair.
A patchy beard.
- Yusuf.
Sharp, piercing eyes.
- Yusuf?
- Uh-huh.
But Yusuf is dead.
Deniz says so in his book.
Great.
Yusuf will go ballistic when he hears that.
Could he have done anything to Deniz?
Yusuf only harms himself.
Where is he?
Where's Deniz?
Why should I tell you?
So you know where he is.
What did you tell the police?
What's it got to do with you?
OK, why did you come to see Deniz
that night?
Yusuf, please say something.
Why did you come over?
For you.
As a surprise. He said
you'd be blown away to see me.
He was laughing like an idiot.
Then we had a fight and I cleared off.
So he was planning it.
Deniz wrote that you died in his book.
That's what I thought.
I guess he wanted to see my face
when I saw you.
So how do I die?
Suicide.
Or that's how it comes across.
So he even decided on my death.
Why do I kill myself?
He doesn't say.
But he portrays you so beautifully.
It's so full of feeling, so genuine.
Sure.
Deniz has to lie to be genuine.
What else does he say?
He talks mostly about your childhood.
Deniz is stuck back in those days?
Aren't we all?
If only I hadn't come that night...
Or...
I'd never left him.
I wish, I wish, I wish.
If only we hadn't swam together
or held each other.
If only I'd never met Deniz.
If only I'd never met Deniz.
No, stick it in your pocket.
- It'll make you feel better.
Stick it in your pocket.
I was worse than you.
Come on, get up.
Congratulations.
So you made it through.
And you recovered, huh?
Well, where did that get you?
Huh?
Have you been able to forget the car?
Or are you stuck back there?
In the car.
Where are you running?
Are you scared of the living?
Zombie!
Zombie!
I don't know
what he said or did to you.
But please don't be mad at Yusuf.
If you got to know him.
If only you could.
What did Deniz tell you about me?
Why'?
Never mind.
You keep it.
It's pan of the book you're working on.
'Neval, we'll never...'
So he wrote those words on a card
he sent you from Rome.
When you love someone...
You hope that they love you back
in the same way.
You imagine that you both have
the same feelings.
But the truth
is a whole different thing.
You can never know
what's going through their heart.
And it's never...
The same as what's going through yours.
See that shop back there?
The clock shop?
It was my father's shop.
I spent my entire childhood there.
Really? Whose is it now?
Shall we go in
and pretend to look at clocks?
Would you like to?
Wouldn't it be nice?
Another time maybe.
Neval Barias.
I apologize.
To all of you.
I had a nightmare.
Hopefully not one you have often.
Or you'll bring the house down on us.
Mum, if there's nothing to do,
I'm going to bed.
- Good night.
Of! you go.
Good night.
Sleep well.
Sultan, you can tidy up here tomorrow.
Sweet dreams, Mr. Orhan.
OK.
You are OK, aren't you?
Sleep well.
Good night, Ms. Süreyya.
Even when Deniz is this age
I still can't sleep until he's home.
I listen to him walk up the stairs,
along the corridor and open my door.
I pretend to be asleep.
He knows, but pretends not to.
He lies down gently beside me.
Sometimes we fall asleep like that.
Ever since he was born
I felt I always needed to protect him.
It's a strange feeling.
A constant pain.
I don't know your story.
But I know pain.
Pain either alienates people
or binds them together forever.
Deniz recognizes a person in pain.
He was aware of the bond between you.
Deniz chooses people.
He always has.
They've found a body in the Bosphorus.
We'll go to identify it tomorrow.
I'd like you to come, too.
Süreyya Soysal-
Mother, I'm coming with you.
Al times like these
I'm sorry I gave up smoking.
Ali Karabulut.
My child!
Welcome.
Thanks.
You came up the stairs so fast.
I didn't want them to wilt.
You shouldn't have.
Thank you. They're beautiful.
- So are you.
- No, I'm just my normal self.
Make yourself at home.
I'll be fightback.
- You have a beautiful place.
- Thank you.
A fabulous view, too.
But let me warn you.
Don't expect a sumptuous dinner
like one of Süreyya's.
The smells from the kitchen aren't bad.
Anyway at Süreyya's,"
Sultan does the cooking
and Sibel lakes credit for it.
Hello, welcome.
I'm Ömer, Neval's husband.
Welcome.
- Good to meet you.
- You, too.
Please, have a seat.
Make yourself at home.
Orhan, Sony.
I haven't introduced you.
Ömer, my husband.
I came across your book a year ago...
Thanks to Deniz.
And I really liked it.
You bring the reader a modem take
on stories from the oral tradition.
Neval read it first.
Then she insisted I read it, too.
And she was right.
You didn't say you'd read my book.
Didn't I? I guess I forgot.
The book's a real treat.
I would so love to have been...
Free like a writer
and not tied to anyone.
We architects usually gel bogged down
in endless numbers and fomulae.
I'm truly envious.
No need to be envious.
I gave up writing a long time ago.
Are You serious?
Why'?
- Let me get the dessert.
- No, no. Please.
I'll do it.
[On the fem] that day...
Sitting there quietly...
Out on deck...
I could hear your breath.
Your shoulder was brushing mine.
Walking towards the car...
That first evening...
When I first saw you...
I never imagined it would be like this.
Then the next day...
Suddenly...
I don't know how it happened...
I'd never have guessed.
You could be the lover
I've been looking for all my life.
But you won't be.
It won't happen.
I just wanted you to know.
Neval, my love.
You've made something amazing again.
Everything you touch turns out perfectly.
What's up?
You left something behind?
Years ago, when I was very young,
I was married with a son.
I'd written that amazing book
you mentioned over dinner.
Zümrüt and I felt strong,
open to everything.
Then something terrible happened.
I'm so sorry. Even saying that here
is very painful.
We couldn't slay in Istanbul
after that.
Zümrüt went to New Zealand.
Her family helped.
And I took refuge in London.
I went into emotional shutdown,
I denied myself feeling, passion, love.
I thought it would always be that way.
But since coming back to Istanbul
after so many years of being away...
Since coming back to Istanbul...
Since I first saw Neval
I've fell a feeling reawaken inside
That I'd forgotten ever existed.
I'm so sorry.
Maybe I was wrong to say this.
But please understand.
It matters to me a lot.
I wanted to get it out there.
I apologize.
I'm really sorry.
Wait, please. Wait.
There's no need to apologize.
The same thing happened to me.
I fell in love with Neval at first sight.
We're equal in that respect.
But there's one key difference.
I saw Neval first.
For heaven's sake, come.
Think of our
little brother, too.
What did you say?
ls the house completely wrecked?
The kids are OK, aren't they?
Ever since Deniz was a boy
my husband never forgave him for anything.
He'd lock Deniz in here for hours.
Time after time at that.
I could've gotten in.
I could've broken the window
and got him out, but I didn't.
Yilmaz believed Deniz could change.
But the more he punished him
the more Deniz resisted.
The key to Deniz's room.
You keep it.
Perhaps you'll find something
that'll lead us to him.
Asa! Hodja's medals,
that big silver tray, the samovar.
I took them, OK? I took them.
They're museum pieces.
You've no right to keep them at home.
That's why you sold them for nothing
to the junk man, huh?
What about mother's jewellery?
I took it to the covered market
to be valued, OK?
Ms. Süreyya asked me to.
If she'd asked me,
I could've got a far better price.
- You'd have swiped it long ago.
- Oh, spare me!
At least it would've stayed with the family,
not someone who's imposed on us forever.
You mean someone
who's laboured for you forever.
- Where's the gratitude-
- All this talk, but what about...
What about the Limoges dinner service?
- I had to sell the pieces separately.
- There are 12 pieces left out of 64.
- They'd break if they were together.
- What lies.
That's enough! Quiet!
Jewellery, paintings...
What can't you share?
Look at you, so attached to things!
As if there's room where we're going.
Mother, there's 240 square metres of it.

ORHAN SAHIN MOVES To LONDON
LITTLE KEMAL'S TRAGIC END
I can put in a spring
from another clock.
But you must leave it here.
OK.
Don't worry,
I'll take rare of it.
- I'll mil as soon as it's done.
- Thanks.
Goodbye.
The place has changed big-time.
A ton of shops have opened.
The guy next door wanted me to sell up.
So he could expand his shop.
I said, 'My brother isn't here.'
- "I can't decide without him.”
- You should've sold if you wanted.
The shop's yours.
You've put so much into it.
No, I used you as an excuse.
I'd have sold up if I'd wanted
without asking you.
Whenever they get pushy
I dig my heels in.
Too bad.
Poor Erdem knows what I'm like.
How is he?
How's his work going?
We separated. Two years ago.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.
We couldn't stand each other anymore.
It's so hard to keep a marriage going
once the kids have grown up.
Take as many trips together
as you like.
Have rOrhantic dinners every night.
Next thing I know
I'm looking at an old man.
And he's looking at an old wOrhan.
All your stuff is in the storeroom.
You know that, don't you?
Don't say you need something.
It's chaos. I'd never find a thing.
Orhan.
I wrote you a ton of letters.
You didn't reply to a single one.
Huh?
You could've sent a card at least.
Ora blank piece of paper.
An empty envelope.
You just disappeared.
I mean totally.
Dad died.
Then Mum got sick.
I was always on my own.
You know what Mum's concern was?
That you'd feel guilty about her.
Imagine.
She didn't want you to regret
not being there when she was sick.
You know how many times
she made me swear...
Not to say anything to you?
But that's how she was.
Amazing.
People were so anxious to gossip
and malign you.
Of course they were.
Running to England was easy.
True.
But going away didn't help.
- It's 11 years since my Ismail died.
- You couldn't have done anything.
Could you bear
not to see your child for a day?
I haven't seen mine for 11 years.
Mountains, rokcs, birds, hear my cries.
I wan! my mild. I wan! him.
Can I have the bill?
Sure.
Can we take care of the bill
for Table 8?
- And tea, please.
Sure, coming up.
Ergün, do you have a second?
If you live in the past,
you miss out on the present.
Ömer, I couldn't wail.
I had to leave the party in a hum].
No, no need.
You have a good time.
OK, I'll explain everything later.
Bye.
Do you have everything, Sultan?
Sweater, jacket, cardigan, underwear.
Yes, everything, Ms. Süreyya.
Oh no, the sweaters fallen out.
I'm sorry to put you out
in the middle of the night...
But I couldn't manage by myself.
We don't have time format now, dear.
Leave right away with Ms. Neval.
I'm lost here,
but shall I come with you?
Thanks, but no need.
Absolutely there is!
Hello? Have you arrived?
Stay where you are.
We 'II be light there.
OK.
Sweetheart
Sultan.
Berfin, Rojda.
Look, your aunt's here.
-Ramazan son, look.
Your aunt's here. Auntie.
Are you going to explain?
Her brother.
Their house was destroyed.
Gun battles and stuff.
In other words...
They've been left homeless.
They've come here to a relative.
For a roof over their heads.
He said, 'Don't come anywhere
here. ' So we're going to Bursa. '
We 're going to Zilan's.
 -I called She's expecting us.
-Sultan, where are we going?
Sony.
Can we go to the bus station?
They have nowhere to stay here.
We have a relative in Bursa.
That's where they're going.
- OK.
- Thanks. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Bless you.
Our soldier is the greatest!
Our soldieris the greatest!
Your bus is leaving soon.
- Thank you very much. Really.
- You're welcome. It's nothing.
They wondered...
What was going on in the hodja's house.
Everyone was seized with curiosity
when he didn't answer the door.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
Of course not. Please.
- Don't gel up.
Deniz keeps a packet of cigarettes
in here.
For when he quits.
Will you have one?
Zero willpower.
The time's come
for us to leave this house.
I was going to move out
to a hotel tomorrow anyway.
I'm not clearing out this room
until Deniz comes back.
Stay here.
OK. Sure.
Yilmaz didn't want him.
He got upset by his barking.
One day he took him away.
We never saw Tommy again.
But Deniz didn't stop waiting for him.
Waiting.
Fantastic.
And that director's so intriguing.
That red waterside mansion
that appears beneath the sky...
And almost scares you at first.
The homeless man
who's only worried about his paper.
Everything that's beautiful
about Istanbul, all its melancholy...
That hard-to-describe muffled quality...
It's all there in what you've written.
It would make a great novel,
you know that, right?
But look.
There's something more important
than any of that.
Don't go.
I asked you here
to share the decision I've made.
I thought it over
and couldn't find any other solution.
I'm going to finish Deniz's book.
I spoke to him about the book.
I know exactly what he wants.
Stop talking
as if Deniz won't come back.
Do you know something
you aren't telling?
Wake up, Yusuf.
Deniz won't ever come back.
What do you know?
What are you talking about?
Don't act innocent,
you of all people, Neval.
You know as well as I do
that Deniz is dead.
All three of you know.
What we don't know is...
Was it an accident or suicide?
Don't be ridiculous.
Deniz would never kill himself.
Maybe someone decided
it was time...
- He left the stage.
- You asshole.
Who'd want to kill Deniz?
You would know.
Who got the stuff for him?
Come on. Let's hear it.
- Fuck you.
Tell us.
Who got Deniz mixed up with scum?
All you can do is run, junkie.
Let's hear it, Mr. Yusuf.
Yusuf.
Just look at your face.
You had a snort before coming, huh?
Maybe even here in my bathroom.
You're nothing, Yusuf. Nothing.
I don't know what Deniz saw in you.
Maybe he was just a slave
to his sense of pity.
Why are you still following me?
You're closest to him.
What do you know about us?
What Deniz mote in his book.
Your childhood.
We learned a lot together.
How to
How to touch, to caress.
What's harmful
and how harmful it is.
Have you ever tried
to swim the Bosphorus?
Never even considered it.
The Bosphorus
was my only victory against him.
As a boy...
I used to ask him to race me
across the Bosphorus.
He'd give it a try. Then...
He'd get scared after five meters
and turn back.
I swam across plenty of times.
It's not easy. It's tough.
Dangerous.
But phenomenal.
To go to the heart of the city,
to be a part of it.
Of Istanbul.
To be a pan of Istanbul.
He'd wait for me on the shore.
Because he knew he could never do it.
My darling.
My boy.
Our Yusufs gone.
He talked about you all the time.
Any excuse and he mentioned you.
Deniz, Deniz.
He always talked about you.
Ms. Süreyya.
The car's waiting.
Goodbye, Orhan.
Mr. Orhan.
I hate to trouble you, but...
Remember to shut
the doors and windows tight.
I hate you.
You can't know...
How much I hate you, Yusuf.
As always, you got me all wrong.
You think I'm using you.
- Orhan?
- Hello. How are you?
- Am I disturbing you?
- No. I'm fine.
I found a letter Deniz wrote Yusuf
on his laptop.
He must have written it
just before disappearing that night.
It's really fazed me.
I wanted to share it with you.
- So read it.
- No. I can't on the phone.
Can we meet?
Where are you?
Orhan, I can'! come.
Sony, I should 've let you know,
but I couldn't do it.
I tried. I set off.
- But then I turned around.
- I'll come wherever you are.
I'm almast home.
Where are you, Neval?
What did Deniz write?
- Neval, where are you?
- I told you. Close to home.
Stay where you are, OK?
You're breaking up.
- I can't hear you properly.
- OK. I've stopped.
Mia! did he write?
The letter starts like this.
I hate you.
You can't know
how much I hate you, Yusuf.
As always you got me all wrong.
I miss you
and you think I'm using you.
I thought that in loving you
it was me against the whole world...
Whereas you were just against me.
You think you've been abandoned.
But it's you who won't
surrender yourself to our love.
Love.
I'm not afraid of the word.
Are you?
Why do you say
you hate yourself and me?
Why do we have to punish ourselves
because others have punished us?
We need just one thing.
And that's a little courage.
I think I have it.
I'm not afraid of you.
I'll rise to your challenge. I'm ready.
How about you?
I'm sorry you couldn't come, Neval.
I wanted to see you.
Tommy.
Always Tommy.
