PARADESAPATTINAM, 1989
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
I don't know, Ponni!
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
Ponni! Ponni, please.
I don't know anything.
Let me go!
Please!
I don't know.
I swear.
I don't know, Ponni.
[HOWLING CONTINUES]
Don't do this!
Please don't, Ponni.
I swear on my child,
I don't know anything.
Listen.
I got her to write it down.
You've hardly stabbed her.
Another stab and she will die.
I want to burn her before that.
Where is the can?
It's in the van.
Go get it.
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
Don't kill her.
We must burn her alive.
Give me the matchbox.
Come on!
Quick.
Where are you going?
- To get the bag.
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
[BURNING]
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
[WOMAN HOWLING IN PAIN]
Mani is in Uthukottai...
And Anbu...
[BURNING]
[WOMAN SCREAMING]
Hurry up.
Let's get going.
Hurry!

[VEHICLE STARTS]
PART 1:
THE LAND, AND ITS PEOPLE
How long do we just
sit around gawking at each other?
Look, you should either
talk it out...
or fight it out.
Perumal, give me my share
of the inheritance.
Or else...
- What inheritance?
The old man left me everything.
You do know that, right?
I don't care about the will.
I am counting on you
to resolve this issue.
Wait, calm down.
Let's resolve this amicably.
- I can't wait any longer!
You got the old man drunk and
screwed me out of my inheritance!
Yeah, do what you can.
Leave now.
I'll chop you and your son to pieces...
and cut off his thumb
for fingerprint.
Do what you can.
Get lost now.
What sort of talk is that?
Did you hear what he said?
Uncle, when was the last time
the toilets were cleaned?
It stinks to high heavens.
Get someone to clean it.
You will find two politicians inside.
Get them to clean it.
Listen, Mani...
he just lands outside my house,
fighting for his share.
The old man knew better,
and left me everything.
You should just go for it, brother.
We can win with just
our people's votes.
We can rise up the ranks
only if we make some bold moves.
But Maari, we don't have the numbers.
Politics, huh?
Brother, just tell me that
you agree to contest...
I'll get the men.
Your face will pull crowds.
We can surely win
without a doubt.
We don't need this, Maari.
Drop it.
Just say the word, brother.
Hey!
You can clean up the society later,
go and clean the toilets now.
I'll send for someone, brother.
What the heck are you talking about?
Won't you clean it?
If you don't want to clean it,
the Councillor can do it.
Watch your tongue.
Show some respect for his age.
His age? I don't give a damn.
Maari, let it go.
Are you glaring at me?
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING]
Did you just glare at me?
The old man was in his senses
when he wrote his will.
Get me that knife.
I'll stab him right here.
I'm debt-ridden and struggling.
He thinks he can take everything!
Unlike what you claim,
I didn't get him drunk.
The old man was in his senses
when he wrote his will.
To hell with his senses.
Brother, tell him to
give me my share.
I won't give him a penny.
I'll kill you.
Giri, calm down.
Nothing to see here.
Get back to work.
Giri, don't...
- Listen to me.
Brother, if not for you,
I'd chop him to pieces right here.
Get lost.
You are going to die
over half an acre of land.
You and your son will
die at my hands.
Look how he talks to me
even in your presence.
I will say what I want.
I'll sock your jaw!
Vasu, what's that noise inside?
Check it out.
You won't give me my share?
You prick.
You want to get into politics?
Then what are we here for?
Anbu, don't...
Maari grabbed Anbu by the collar.
Hurry up, brother.
Hey Maari!
[SQUABBLING]
Stop, Maari.
You dare to hit him?
- Calm down, Anbu.
Why did you grab him
by the collar?
I didn't do anything.
He ran his mouth for no reason.
He didn't say anything wrong,
did he?
I've been watching you all week.
You are just a mongrel
who works for us.
You come to our place and plot
against us in the elections...
and you want him to do
nothing about it?
Kandasami, you're teaming up with this guy
and getting too cocky.
I'll throw you out!
Get out!
Get him out of here.
Old man...
- Go away!
Don't ever come back here
looking for work...
Get out!
- Burn him, boss.
Let's chop him to pieces right here.
- Calm down, Vasu.
[OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS]
Having a policewoman for a wife
has gone to your head, huh?
I'll sort you out.
Anbu, don't...
Did you just call me by my name?
Let it go, Anbu.
[INDISTINCT SQUABBLING]
Anbu, don't you dare
talk about my family.
That's a lot of arrogance for someone
who lets his wife run wild.
I'll sort her out too.
Come on, Maari.
Let's just go.
Anbu, his wife is a cop?
Yes, Uncle.
Does that scare you?
She is nice and tender.
Come, we'll make soup out of her.
Let's sort her out.
Why is only the hair on your head black?
When I was a little boy,
my mother oiled only my head.
So my hair alone is black.
My mother oils my hair everyday too.
But she never oils her hair.
So my mother's hair is red and silky.
I have black hair, like my father.
Do you like your mother
or your father?
I like my father.
I like my mother.
I like the lady who lives next door.
I like their baby goat.
I like Sudalai.
Who is Sudalai?
My buddy.
I'll bring him along tomorrow.
And I like the little baby
from next door.
Don't tell your mother
I gave you these.
I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Take care.
[PLAYFUL MUSIC BEGINS]
[MUSIC FADES]
You can't just go with anyone.
Come.
[MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Ma, why don't you like Sangayya?
Shut up and come.
I just wanted to know.
Don't talk like a grown-up.
Okay?
Tell me, Ma.
I wonder how they put up
with you at school.
How come your husband
came home early today?
He is drunk.
Be careful, girl!
He could hardly walk.
Go and check on him.
Okay, sister.
I'll check on him.
Dad...
Dad, what's that bruise
on your eye?
It's nothing.
Go away.
Ma...
Dad has gotten drunk and
bruised himself again.
Put your bag away
and wash your face.
Okay.
What happened?
What happened?
Again?
There was a minor issue at the mill.
It was about the elections.
And this is how they took it out.
I lost my temper,
and lost my job too.
You lost your job?
This is why I told you
to stay away from these elections.
We need to turn this hut
to a concrete house.
Our girl is growing so fast.
We need to save for her.
I'm scared.
But you come home drunk every day.
She will stop respecting you.
Look, she mocks you already.
Fine, forget about it.
What's done is done.
Apologise to them and
get your job back tomorrow.
Let's not get into any fights
or quarrels.
Let's just mind our own business.
What's on your mind?
The policewoman has ordered me.
Do I have a choice but to abide?
Where did that come from?
How long have you been
having these thoughts?
Yeah.
Everyone around town calls me
"Mr. Policewoman" anyway.
Let me make this clear.
The moment my shift gets over,
I take my badge off.
It's just a job.
Something that pays the bills.
That's all.
You come home drunk every day.
Who will support the family?
Go back to work tomorrow.
Forget about what happened.
Just apologise
and get your job back.
Go wash your face.
I'll make some rice.
[OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYS]
Sangayya, let's drink after work?
No thanks!
He says that all the time.
We'll drink anyway.
Take this, brother.
How much longer?
Another five minutes, Sangayya.
Call me after you
fill the entry.
Fine, I'll call you.
[OMINOUS MUSIC CONTINUES]
[MUSIC FADES]
We can't afford to lose this job.
Who else could hire us?
Your wife had a comfortable life,
and she gave it up to marry you.
You sold your concrete house.
She's got a point.
It is only fair.
Just apologise to them, Maari.
That's not an issue, brother.
They're doing this to prevent us
from moving up.
Should I really bow before them again?
Maari, we must prioritise
our livelihoods.
Apologise to them,
at least for your wife and kid.
Just come with me.
Come on, son.
Brother...
Wait here.
My mouth is parched.
- Kolappan will bring it, be patient.
You shouldn't have started drinking.
Greetings, sir.
Maari has come.
What happened yesterday
was a mistake.
Forgive him.
He won't come and apologise?
I'll go and fetch him.
Maari...
Maari...
Maari...
Hurry up.
Go. Apologise to him.
What happened yesterday was a mistake.
It won't happen again.
You call that an apology?
Screw that.
Go and clean the toilet.
Sir, that's uncalled for.
What's uncalled for?
He hit one of my people!
And this is uncalled for?
Kandasami, that's your limit.
There is no place for people
with self respect here.
Go and start your own trade.
Come on, Anbu...
What could the poor guy do?
He has a good looking wife.
He can send her to us
and earn some money.
He can live like a king.
He can travel by car.
Buy jewellery.
There are no caste barriers
in this trade.
I will even give you
a few rice mills.
Bring her to us.
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
Maari, what are you doing?
[MEN SHOUTING]
I'll kill you.
Brother, he spat on your face.
Anbu, don't spare him.
Break his face, Anbu!
This is so humiliating.
I know. It was my face!
We shouldn't let him get away.
Brother, we must kill him.
Let's get him tonight.
Uncle...
Uncle, we have to settle this.
We must get him.
Anbu, didn't you say
his wife's a cop?
Call Deva.
I will.
- Call Deva.
He spat on my face.
[MUSIC FADES]
Sangayya!
Sangayya...
This is the friend
I told you about.
He is here.
Careful, Sudalai.
Watch out for those stones.
Make him sit.
Come, Sudalai.
Sit.
This is the friend
I told you about.
What is your name?
He is talking to you, Sudalai.
Sudalai, brother.
Which grade are you in?
- 8th grade.
I am only in 3rd grade.
But I do all his homework.
Because he can't see.
He doesn't know what
red color is.
Or green color.
Shush. Don't say that.
He won't feel bad.
Would you feel bad, Sudalai?
It's okay, brother.
She is always making fun of me.
Sudalai...
Sudalai, it's your father.
Boy...
Dad?
Shouldn't you be in school?
Huh?
Get up.
Let's go.
Careful.
Don't come here alone
after school.
Do you have any idea
about the problems going on here?
I work so hard just for you, son.
Your uncle is very angry with us.
Why is your mother
still not here?
My mother comes late sometimes.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
[MUSIC FADES]
Hello, Ponni.
Sir, why did you call me
at this hour?
My child is alone.
Just a minor dispute.
We can leave in a few minutes.
Come.
Stay right here.
I'll just have a word and come.
Boss, Maari's wife is here.
She is hot, alright.
Anbu was right.
Sudalai...
Sister Ponni?
Have you seen Dhanam?
She took me to the tree
to meet one Sangayya.
We were talking, and then
my father took me away.
Fine.
Have you eaten?
- Not yet, sister.
But she's a cop, brother.
So what?
So what if she is a cop?
No cop is too powerful
for the boss.
Brother, he is flattering you
to protect himself.
Perumal, stop goading him on.
It was Maari who insulted you.
I'll bring him to you.
Do as you please with him.
But she is a cop.
Which is why he thinks
he can do as he pleases.
It's not your face
that he spat on.
He spat on my face!
Let her go, brother.
Your job was to bring her here.
You've done your job.
Shut up, and have a drink.
I'll take it from here.
Boss, don't get worked up.
Drink!
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
Deva, come on.
You heard the boss.
Sit.
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Sudalai gets yelled at
by his teacher.
He gets yelled at by his father.
He doesn't study well.
But I am a good girl.
I study well.
It's so late.
Your mother is still not here?
You are right.
It's dark.
I am scared, Sangayya.
Can you take me home?
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
Fine, let's go.
Watch out for the stones.
[THUD]
[WINCING IN PAIN]
[WINCING IN PAIN]
[SLAP]
[WINCING IN PAIN]
[SINISTER MUSIC]
I feel we are going overboard.
She is a cop, brother.
If you end up killing her,
we will be in deep trouble.
A mongrel who took wages
from me with folded hands...
spat on my face
in front of everyone.
Now I'm supposed to be scared
of his cop wife?
Consider my caste, my status,
and my prestige.
I don't deserve that, at my age.
Just sit back and
enjoy the show tonight.
[DOOR OPENS]
Vasu...
Vasu, sit.
Sit down, Vasu!
Perumal...
Yes, boss?
- Get the kerosene and the other stuff.
Okay, boss.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
Why doesn't my mother like you?
[SANGAYYA SMIRKS]
You need to ask your mother.
I did ask her.
What did she say?
She told me to stop talking
like a grown-up.
[LAUGHING]
She is right.
Tell me, Sangayya. Don't treat me
like my mother does.
She never forbids me from
talking to anyone else in town.
But why doesn't she want me
to talk to you?
I won't to your house.
I'll drop you off at a distance.
Or your mother will yell at me.
Just come.
I'll take care of it.
I am the one who protects
Sudalai at school.
This way, Sangayya.
This way?
Yes, come.
[SINISTER MUSIC]
[PONNI YELPS]
I'll be back.
[MUSIC FADES]
Dhana, go home.
I'll head back.
Come, Sangayya.
Just come.
No, Dhana.
Your mother will lose it.
I will handle it.
Come.
No one talks to Sudalai.
Only his mother used to
talk to him.
But she died too.
So I'm the only one
who talks to him.
I think my father is back.
Come, Sangayya.
Fine, go.
He always picks up a fight,
gets drunk and passes out.
Come, Sangayya.
I'll show you my
childhood photos.
Tell Perumal to hurry up
and get the stuff.
Vasu, come.
Your turn.
[PONNI GROANS SOFTLY]
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
[PUNCHING]
[PONNI GROANS]
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
That's me.
I was a year old.
Why is your mother
still not home?
I am sleepy, Sangayya.
Okay, come.
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
Vasu, hurry up.
Hurry.
Perumal, over here. Quick!
- Coming, boss.
Get the bike.
- Boys...
Yes, I meant you.
Get in there.
Have a go.
Start the bike.
Hurry up.
Sudalai, you too.
Go in.
Let's go, guys.
Come on.
Let's go.
Go on.
Faster.
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
[SINISTER MUSIC BEGINS]
Sudalai, come on.
Hurry up.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
[MUSIC STOPS]
Go to sleep.
Where are you going, Sangayya?
I'm not going anywhere.
I'll just wait outside
till your mother comes back.
You go to sleep.
[OMINOUS MUSIC BEGINS]
Hey, get up!
Scram.
Go!
You punks!
Get out!
[SINISTER MUSIC BEGINS]
I didn't know they'd go this far.
I should not have brought you here.
Forgive me.
Anbu, who is that guy in shorts?
This is her house, right?
Uncle, that's definitely her house.
I've followed the policewoman home
countless times.
That's the house.
We'll handle the guy,
whoever he is.
Okay, let's go.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
[WHISPERING] Vasu, come here.
Handle that guy.
Hold on.
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
Go now.
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
Got a light?
[YELPING IN PAIN]
Hurry up and burn it down!
Uncle, come on.
Hurry up.
[SANGAYYA SCREAMING]
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
Dhana!
Dhana!
Dhana!
[MUSIC FADES]
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
[WHISPERING] Lock the door.
[WHISPERING] That's enough.
Pour it!
Don't stand there gawking.
Pour it!
Pour some inside the house.
Over here.
Pour it.
Hurry up.
Make it quick!
Stop dawdling.
Boy, scram!
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
Please don't mistake me, Ponni.
[FIRE CACKLING]
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
Maari's house is on fire!
[SANGAYYA COUGHS]
They've set the house on fire.
Catch them!
They are getting away.
Catch them!
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
[WOMAN CRYING]
Who would do such a horrible thing?
Run after them!
Dhana... Dhana...
Dhana...
Dhana...
Dhana! Dhana!
Dhana!
Dhana!
Dhana!
Dhana!
Dhana...
You cowards!
[SANGAYYA SCREAMING]
Dhana...
Dhana...
Dhana!
Dhana...
Oh, no.
Dhana...
Dhana...
Dhana...
Dhana...
[SANGAYYA SCREAMING]
No!
Oh, Dhana!
[LAMENTING] Dhana!
Oh, Dhana!
No...
What do I do now?
No! Dhana!
Dhana!
Oh, no.
[LAMENTING] Dhana, Dhana, Dhana...
[SCREAMING]
Dhana!
Dhana...
[WAILING]
[WAILING CONTINUES]
Dhana!
[SANGAYYA WAILING]
Dhana...
Dhana...
You wretched woman!
You damned woman!
You came all the way here,
you bloody home-wrecker?
Why are you outside my door?
You shameless woman.
You lust after another woman's husband?
What have you got that I don't?
How did you seduce my husband?
Why do you want to
earn my wrath?
You wretched woman.
Are you here to seduce my husband
with your fair skin?
Have I ever left you
wanting for anything?
Why did you have to
ruin my life?
I hope you suffer.
How dare you bring another woman
and make me share our life?
You will rot in hell.
You're not man enough to
feed your wife and child.
And now you want another woman?
I'm cursing you...
You and your daughter
will burn to ashes.
Your family will burn to ashes.
You want a piece of my life?
May you suffer.
My curse will haunt you.
You will turn to dust.
Your bloodline will disappear.
Ma, let's just leave.
Ma, let's go.
Let's go, Ponni.
- You will turn to dust.
Sangayya, what are you looking at?
Don't go calling her your sister
or I'll break your legs.
Father and son should just eat
my food and stay put.
[CONTINUES CRYING]
PART 2
PONNI, THE CURSE, AND SOCIETY
Ponni...
Ponni?
You can't just sit there.
You haven't eaten anything
since morning.
Come, let's eat.
Ponni...
Ponni?
Those four men have
surrendered to the police.
You've come to see if
your mother's curse came true?
Take care of Ponni.
Who are you?
I am Ponni's brother.
I curse you...
I swear, you will suffer.
You and your daughter
will burn to ashes.
Your whole family will
burn to the ground.
You home-wrecker!
My curse will haunt you forever.
- Ma, let's go.
You will turn to dust.
- Let's go, Ponni.
Sangayya, what are you looking at?
Don't go calling her your sister
or I'll break your legs.
Father and son should just eat
my food and stay put.
If you ever go after that woman,
I will poison your food.
Sangayya, where are you going?
Stop!
See, he's gone behind her too.
Like father, like son.
Looks like she's cast a spell
on him, too.
Stop, boy.
Sangayya!
I'm screaming myself hoarse
and he pays no heed to me.
[VOICE FADING] Your son will waste away,
just like you.
[SEA WAVES CRASHING]
[TYPEWRITER CLACKING]
Your case is up next.
Be ready.
Our case is next, Ponni.
Your case is next, madam.
Listen to me, Ponni.
We don't have a choice.
They will try to crack the case somehow.
File a rape case.
Only then will it hold up in court.
Sir...
Let's not file a rape case.
Get them punished
under the cases we've filed.
We don't have a choice, Ponni.
Only rape charges will hold.
They are here.
I am going in.
Take care of her.
Let's go.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BEGINS]
Come on, hurry.
Get down. Quick.
Move it.
Move.
- Hurry up.
Get down.
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
Sir...
Go and talk to her.
She can't mention anything
about rape, understood?
Okay, I will talk to her.
Hurry up.
Let go of me.
Can I borrow your pen?
[ANBU CHUCKLES]
What a prick!
He's so desperate.
I hope he rots in hell.
I wish he would just die.
Wish he would be struck by lightning.
Look at his face!
Anbu...
Go in.
I am going!
[PONNI GASPS]
[MUSIC FADES]
Hurry up.
Take that off.
You too.
Hurry up.
Uncuff them, sir.
Ponni?
I nabbed all of them.
Take six months off,
and get some rest.
I'll make sure
you get your salary.
Get down.
Case no. 309/89.
Mani and co - Vasu, Anbu,
and Perumal.
Come in.
Come on.
Get in.
Just don't report the rape.
Sir...
It brings dishonour
upon the family.
It's a disgrace
to the department too.
She is a lone woman now.
I can talk to them
and get her a good compensation.
Sir, if we wanted to report the rape,
we'd have to report all of them.
She told me everything.
We know what to do.
After everything they did,
they are being lewd even now.
That last guy who went in,
that bearded guy.
He was being very lewd,
that jerk!
Put them behind bars.
Don't confuse her.
Ponni...
I have your best interests at heart.
We know what is good for her.
Stop messing with her head.
Get going, sir.
Go and put them in jail.
Don't worry, Ponni.
We will get through this.
Stay strong.
So if there's no one inside,
you can burn the house down?
Fifteen days judicial remand.
Sir..
Take them away.
Come.
[OMINOUS MUSIC]
I talked to her.
I don't think she will agree.
I feel she will definitely
file a complaint.
Okay, I'll take care of it.
Take them over there.
Okay.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
Don't worry, Ponni.
Everything will be alright.
Don't lose heart.
They will definitely be
locked up behind bars.
After all this is over,
just quit your police job.
You can make a living
through some other means.
Stay strong, Ponni.
I am with you.
They've been remanded for 15 days.
They will crack the case
in the next hearing.
They claim there was no one inside
the house when they burned it down.
Deva, stop.
Why are you shifting us
back and forth?
All of us surrendered
counting on you both.
And that guy is said
we're remanded for fifteen days!
What is going on?
Brother, it's a good thing you surrendered.
Or the townsfolk would have
ripped you apart.
Yeah, right!
Brother, don't worry.
Rani madam will take care of everything.
This won't work out.
We should have handled it our way.
Where is Rani?
Rani, forget about fifteen days.
I won't go to jail for fifteen minutes.
Uncle, you think I'd let that happen?
That's what I'm here for.
I'll take care of everything.
Giri is downstairs.
He's organized hideouts for each you.
Stay out of sight.
Until you hear from me,
keep your mouths and asses shut.
I'd rather go to jail
than go with Giri.
Fine! Stay here and die.
Take them with you.
Keep your mouth shut.
Let go of me.
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
Make way.
Let's go.
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES]
Take this.
Come.
Come on.
Come on.
Quick.
[SHOUTING CONTINUES]
Constable, hurry up.
Yes, madam?
- Take them.
Rani, can Giri be trusted?
- Just go.
Go.
Come this way, people.
[MUSIC INTENSIFIES]
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
[SHOUTING CONTINUES]
[WHISPERING] Giri...
All okay?
Go.
Go on.
Hurry up.
Get going.
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
Come on.
Hurry up.
Come on, you jerk.
Hurry up.
[SPITS]
Cheat me of my inheritance,
didn't you? Come to me now.
I'll sort you out.

It's okay.
Let's go, brother.
[SHOUTING CONTINUES]
Open the door.
[WHISPERING] Have they left?
- Yes, madam.
Close the door.
Tell them exactly what I told you.
Okay.
- Okay, go.
You too.
- Okay, madam.
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]
Where is everyone?
Those four men have escaped.
Where did they escape?
How could this happen?
They went that way.
- Answer me.
They went that way.
- Are you kidding me?
Police, come here.
Sir, how could you let them get away?
I was just doing my duty.
- Answer me, sir.
Let me do my job.
Let go of me, Ponni.
I don't know anything.
Where are they?
I know it was you.
You let them escape.
- Trust me, Ponni.
Tell me the truth.
- It wasn't me.
I am sure it was you.
- Don't shame me in public.
Where have they gone?
Haven't I been good to you?
Don't do this.
I will not spare any of you.
I know it was you.
I'm not going to spare you.
I won't spare you.
I won't spare any of you.
Let go of me!
Don't worry, it will be alright.
- Let's go, Ponni.
I'm not going to spare you.
I won't spare any of you.
[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC BEGINS]
My son died, Ponni.
They killed him.
It was all over...
one mango.
Just one mango.
He stole it because he was hungry.
They tied him up to the tree
and thrashed him.
They also beat up my wife
when she went to save him.
They killed them both
and tossed them into a well.
Then they spread lies around town
that I tortured them to death.
Who would believe the words
of a powerless low-born like me?
Why did such a thing happen?
Why did they kill my family?
I only wanted to demand justice.
They hit me, humiliated me,
and chased me away.
My son is gone.
My wife is gone.
Whatever little pride I had
is gone too.
[SANGAYYA CRYING]
You always complain that
my mother cursed you.
It's not like we had a good life either.
Such a miserable life.
You didn't want revenge?
I did, Ponni.
I even got a knife and a gun.
But then I saw you.
And Dhanam.
I forgot all about it.
Dhanam became my whole life.
This was a new lease of life for me, Ponni.
The urge to kill and seek revenge...
...everything disappeared.
Do you know what vengeance is?
When someone throws a stone at us...
we throw a stone back at them.
When someone spits on us...
we spit right back at them.
But if someone..
Destroys everything...
our dreams,
our lives...
our wishes...
our world...
everything.
And all he gets is prison time.
Do you even call that vengeance?
Huh?
My baby.
My husband.
Imagine the pain they must have
endured while dying.
I want to inflict that pain
on those scumbags.
My Dhanam...
Imagine the torment and suffering
she must have gone through.
She must have run around helplessly.
She must have cried out
for her father.
And my husband...
they killed him in his sleep.
They killed him in his sleep.
Could they have done it
if he was awake?
He wouldn't have let them.
I want to kill those people.
I want to stab them to death.
I want to slaughter them.
Their skin...
...how their skin
must have burnt.
It must have burnt so bad!
How my husband's skin
must have burned!
My Dhanam...
...how my child's skin
must have burned.
That pain.
That fear.
I want to see it in the eyes
of those scumbags.
That pain.
I want to kill them.
I want to stab them to death.
I want to chop them to pieces.
With my bare hands.
I want to chop them to pieces
with my own hands.
I feel the same way.
Come.
Let's find those scumbags
and slaughter them.
Come, Ponni.
I know how to find them.
I've made the arrangements.

I don't know where they are.
They all ran in different directions.

Vasu is hiding in a launch-boat

That is all I know.
What about Perumal?
