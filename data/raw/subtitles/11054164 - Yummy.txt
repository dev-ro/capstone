Hi. I am Sylvia.
Yes, of course, Sylvia.
So nice to meet you.
Please.
Daniel, I would like you
to show rooms
to everyone
for liposculpture.
Come with me, darling.
Dr. Krawczyk is
very brilliant surgeon.
He is developing a brand new
rejuvenation treatment,
based on experimental
skin cell technology.
This lady just had
chemical peeling
to make skin
look young again.
I saw the result
on the website.
Amazing!
I am sorry for staring,
but you have beautiful body.
- Thank you.
- Did Dr. Krawczyk do them?
Oh, no, no, no,
they're mine.
They seem a bit young for
plastic surgery.
Teen pregnancies.
We give them free abortion.
Oh, that's really nice.
Eh, poepie?
So, you will only
have grin lift?
No, I have also tummy-tuck,
anal bleaching,
Brazilian lift,
and eyelids.
Poepie?
Is he all right?
He looks like he seen ghost.
He was supposed
to become a doctor.
He dropped out of medical school
because he's afraid of blood.
- Afraid of blood?
- Seriously?
It's a condition.
A lot of people have it.
It's called hemophobia.
Oh.
♪ We'll be in
a parcel by sunset ♪
Is your song, no?
Yeah.
It's been a while.
You're recovering well.
Very good.
So...
You are scheduled for next
treatment liposuction on...
Alfred Schultz?
But, uh, you are
William Maier, no?
Yes, it's a privacy
thing, okay?
So, nobody to know
you are here?
I understand.
Not good for image
of a famous person, huh?
Don't worry.
Nobody will ever know you are
here, Mr. Schultz.
There's nothing wrong
with being gay.
I mean, some of
my best friends are gay.
No, hemophobia,
not homophobia.
Oh.
Doctor, I like you to meet
lovely new guests.
Oh, it's an honor to meet you,
Dr. Krawczyk.
Beautiful ladies!
I will make you
even more beautiful!
Yes, yes.
This is Ms. Oksana.
She's here
for tattoo removal.
May I?
I would suggest G cup.
No, no, no, I, uh...
I want them smaller,
not bigger.
Oh, yes, of course.
I thought a B.
B is a good size, no? Mm-hmm.
If you want,
we can do it.
Yes, I want a B.
Definitely a B.
Okay, a B.
No problem, B, B.
But I think that
G cup is better, no?
And I make you
even more beautiful.
Cigarette?
No, thank you.
That's a smart boy.
Are you having
surgery today?
Me?
Yeah.
No, no.
I thought... sorry.
No, we're here
for me.
For you?
Yeah, I'm having
a breast reduction.
Really? Pity.
You've got a body
to die for.
Why mess with God's work?
Everybody says
that, but...
I mean I have back problems.
I can't run for the bus.
Yeah.
If you were my girlfriend,
I'd buy you a car.
We have a car.
Oh, yeah, I've seen it.
An old timer, right?
So, you work in
the hospital?
Mm-hmm.
Does it have
a good reputation?
He's more nervous
than you are.
No, no, it's just
that I mean...
It's good men
can't have babies.
Humanity would go extinct.
Yes, that's true.
Poepie?
This is for disinfection
incision area.
Yes, I know, honey.
Alison Jacobs?
Yes.
We will call you
in one minute.
Excuse me, don't you have to
check her blood type?
That's not my job, sir.
Uh, Doctor, do you know her
blood type at all?
Mister, please, you wait
outside, yes?
Isn't it prohibited to
drink coffee in an OR?
Dr. Lenic he knows
what he's doing.
He's a real professional.
Yeah, according to EU
regulations, it's really not...
Sit down, please.
Can I get you something?
I'm fine. Can't she just answer
a simple question...
But you have
too many questions, yes?
All information
on website.
Yeah, I've checked
the website, and it said nothing
about what type of
anaesthesia or what happens
with the glandular tissue.
Are you a doctor? No, but I've studied...
...to be one, okay?
Yeah, for a year.
I can give you a tour
of the building.
It's better than waiting
and getting nervous.
That's a good idea.
It's important that
your girlfriend
is relaxed
before surgery.
Come.
It's okay.
Did you know that in
China they already performed
plastic surgery
2,000 years...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
I went to med school.
Oh, yeah,
for five minutes, no?
But don't worry.
Here the doctors did
finish their studies.
Mobile please.
Yes.
And also this...
Okay.
Take off.
And also this.
So what's your job?
You bring people
to the airport?
Travel agent.
I've been working in this
country for a year now, but...
you know the best
part of my job?
The girls.
After the treatment
they are always, you know...
Ecstatic.
They feel all yummy and sexy,
and they want affirmation.
That's when I come in.
Easy pussy.
You know those
abortions they do here?
They use the fetuses
for stem cell treatment.
This experimental
stem cell stuff,
none of that has been
proven to work, has it?
Come on, man.
It's all about money.
Come.
Excuse me?
I thought Dr. Krawczyk
was doing the operation.
No problem at all.
You know,
I want a B cup, eh?
Mm-hmm.
Okay.
Are we allowed
to be here?
I promised Alison
I'd be there when she wakes up,
so...
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
In two hours.
They've got plenty of work on
those bazookas of hers.
Excuse me?
Chill, man.
Come on, it was a compliment.
She's gorgeous.
How did you manage to
pick up a girl like that?
Yeah, wouldn't you
like to know.
Rohypnol?
Wait a moment.
What are we doing here?
Won't be long!
Are you okay?
Can you breathe?
Shh, shh. Hold on. Hold on.
I'm going to take it off
for you, okay?
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.
What are you doing?
I thought
she couldn't breathe,
and then I wanted
to help her...
Oh, we need to go.
Come, come, come.
W-w-what the fuck
was that?
Did you know
she was in there?
No, no, of course not.
Just what the fuck?
Okay, I need
to get to Alison.
Which way to the surgery? This way.
But, hey, we were
never there, got it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay.
Doctor: You're in the best
place, in perfect hands.
Two minutes, you'll
be sleeping like baby.
When you wake up...
Wait, stop.
Stop immediately.
Bitanga.
No, no, it's okay.
You, out. No, no, no.
I'm not leaving
without her.
Stop the operation
right now, okay?!
Please, leave me alone!
No operation, no operation!
Idiot.
Are you feeling
better now?
Yeah, yeah.
Where is Alison?
Getting ready
for surgery.
She had to wait because you made
mess in operation room.
What is that?
Huh?
What is that?
Good?
Why am I tied up?
You had panic attack.
It's better you stay out
of operation room.
Can you please
untie me?
Uh... are you
more calm now?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm... I'm chill.
And stay in bed.
You're still dizzy
from sedation.
What?
What... what is happening?
But... no, no.
Stoj. Mister?
Can I help you?
No, it's okay,
it's my girlfriend.
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. Let me go.
Hey, hey, don't touch her.
Don't touch.
You, out.
Hey, I'm not
leaving without her.
Get out!
Where are you going?
Alison, Alison.
It's, um, probably just
safety precaution.
I saw...
I saw a man eating... a man.
You saw a man eating what?
Finish sentence.
- What?
- We take the stairs.
Let's go!
Go, go, go.
Move, move, move, move.
Sorry, uh, which way
to the recovery room?
Mama?
Alison?
Mama?
Stay away!
Aaaah!
Hey!
Fuck.
Aah!
Relax.
I'm not one of them.
Okay.
Shh.
I've seen you on TV.
Yeah, well...
my visit here is...
secret.
Okay?
No one will ever know.
We're going to die here.
Hey, don't say that.
They'll send help, okay?
Okay.
Don't worry.
Okay.
Help me!
What? It burns, it burns.
What is this?
Chemical skin peeling.
Nurse got afraid
and ran away.
It hurts.
Okay. Okay, we go.
Come.
Let's go.
We're going
to look for water.
Come, come.
Scheisse!
Okay, come.
What? Come on.
Please, we need water.
Let us in! Come on, please!
Help me!
Come on, let us in!
We need water! She's in pain!
They need help.
No, they're wounded,
they're infected.
They will kill us!
She's not infected!
Go away!
We've got knives,
and we will use them!
It hurts!
Where are you going?
Wait! Wait!
You...
you saved my life.
Yeah, well...
Wait!
Mama.
Okay.
Shhh.
Oh, fuck.
Aaaah!
Are you okay?
Come.
Thanks.
Oh, shit.
We'll be fine.
I don't want to die.
Me neither.
Like virgin.
Yeah... what?
This is not
the time to...
Why not?
You're right.
We should make the best of
the little time we have left.
I always imagined it would be
on a beach, you know?
Listen, you have
to be gentle with me.
Why?
What happened?
Penis enlargement.
A while ago,
a small one.
A-a small enlargement.
I'm not yet
supposed to.
But for you,
I will try.
We just
have to be careful.
Okay.
I guess.
Alison.
The big fella
is looking much better.
I'll just clean him up a bit.
Can you get me a towel?
Yes.
Please stay quiet.
Aah! It's burning hot!
I burned myself. Fuck!
Wait.
Here, I think
this is for burns.
Ah.
Ah. What kind of
a cock shit cream is this?
It smells fucked up.
Can't read it.
Here, let me...
Fucking
caveman alphabet.
Oi.
Aaah!
Put it out!
Put it out!
Okay.
Wait!
Stop moving.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
I can't
feel it anymore.
It was accident.
I-I'm sorry.
Get the fuck
out of my way!
No. No!
Fuck off!
I need a doctor! Now!
No, no!
W-what is happening?
Have you seen my girlfriend?
What girlfriend?
Lots of girlfriends here.
The one with
breast reduction.
Yeah. Probably dead.
Dead?
We go.
Come.
Okay.
Oh, shit!
- Come.
- Okay.
Come quick.
Go, go.
Put her down there.
What the hell
is happening here?
God is punishing us for
interfering with his creation.
Oh, please. We just
have to get out of here.
Impossible.
Everybody on
ground floor is infected.
Shit! Shit!
There's no signal.
Move.
Thank you.
Move.
Mm!
Shit.
Poepie?
Apologize, my friend.
I thought you were them.
It's okay.
She has virus.
What? No, I have
been operated.
I-I feel fine.
Well, I'm healthy.
I'm dizzy. Just dizzy.
I need my makeup,
Ally, I'm right.
She is in first stage.
It would be best to end
suffering now.
What? You cannot just kill her.
She is a danger to us all.
See? She's changing now.
We cannot wait.
No, no. I'm sorry.
It's just my stomach.
Just quick blow
on the head.
No. You stay away
from my mother.
It will be almost painless,
I promise.
No.
Somebody hold her.
Fine, I can do it
like this.
No, no!
Aaah!
Now you're
infected, too.
Do we have to kill
you, too?
No, no, no.
I have not been bitten.
It's less urgent
with me.
Kurwa!
No, no!
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
Maybe we can
create vaccine.
What?
You almost killed my...
You really think there is
treatment for this?
I need to
get to the pharmacy.
Okay.
Can we go there?
This way.
Hurry up!
Hurry, hurry.
They're down there, quick.
- Hurry.
- Okay, come on.
Lock the door,
lock the door!
Michael, help me.
Put her down before
she starts to bite.
Okay, okay.
Here.
Yonah, let's try complera.
But use a saline.
Complera intravenously?
We have no time
to play safe.
We need intravenous
injection.
Mama?
Ally?
Yeah.
I can make a sterile
solution if you want.
Do it!
Get me a syringe.
Okay.
Let's try this.
Mama?
Mama?
Careful,
she's changing.
Maybe we try Neuraminidase
blocker with AZT?
No, no, no. It doesn't
affect the RNA polymerase.
So, you know virus?
We are in a hurry, okay?
Get me some Cytosine
and a syringe.
- Yeah.
- Here's the syringe.
We have to draw blood.
Hold her head!
Be careful!
Vicious bitch.
Got it. Okay.
Yonah, please make
a new protein base.
This one is off. It's no use.
- I'll do it.
- We have to save
woman and everyone else. She is lost.
Yonah, I am your boss.
You are in my country,
you work in my hospital.
Listen to me!
First,
I want explanation.
Is virus created in special
youth treatment program?
You were secretly
treating people here.
They did not know?
Okay, okay.
Patient Zero,
she was also in program,
but she was contained.
I don't know how
she could get out.
Somehow, I just wanted
to make people happy.
That's why we did
this enzyme experiment,
to stop aging.
To make the world
look more beautiful.
Better he dies like man,
not like animal.
What have you done?
He was infected, and much
stronger than woman.
We could not longer take
any risks, or we would all die.
But he was the only one who
could find a cure.
Maybe we can, Yonah.
What if we mix the complera
with the rilpivirine?
Mama.
Mama.
Get me diarylprimidine.
Okay.
The syringe.
Yeah.
Here.
Hold head.
Okay.
Quick, I need amputation
before virus spreads!
Okay.
Chop it off!
Ready?
Do it!
- Son of bitch.
- Oh, shit.
Be quick! Be quick!
Hurry! Please.
- Go. Please
- No time.
Virus will reach my brain.
That's how you do it!
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Aaah!
Oh, God!
Oh, turn it off!
Of, fuck!
Aaah!
- She's getting loose.
- Please, put this woman
out of misery.
Michael,
kill her now!
Oh...
Okay.
Do it!
What are you
waiting for?
Michael,
kill her now!
Do it!
Come on, do it!
Sorry, Ma.
Shh.
Guys, we have to leave.
Shit.
No!
There is no key.
We are so fucked.
What you got?
You stupid junky.
So what?
You just killed
someone, bitch.
Do we have some iodine?
We just have to get
the fuck out of here.
This will get us
the fuck out of here.
You're kidding, no?
No.
Iodine and ammonia.
This will blow open
the door.
Clever.
This'll work.
Will that be powerful
enough, pookie?
You bet your ass.
- Come on.
- Okay, watch out, watch out.
This will cause
quite a blast.
Oh, pitchka.
It's a fucking
sliding door.
Okay.
Michael!
Whoa!
I got one of
those motherfuckers.
We can go down
at the other side.
Come on.
Come on. Hurry.
Fuck.
Hold on.
I'm okay, I'm okay.
Hurry.
Take my hand.
No, no, no.
Oh, shit.
Oh, pitchka.
Do you mind?
Oh, yeah.
You completely forgot
I understand a bit
of your
monkey language, huh?
I heard what Dr. Crapshit said
just before you killed him.
I know that
the anonymous patients' program
was your idea.
You are responsible
for this shit.
So...
Is this what you want?
I prefer my pussy
a bit younger.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Can I?
Mm-hmm.
Thanks.
Are you okay?
No.
Come on.
Oh, come, come here.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Come. Let's go.
Follow me.
Oh, fuck.
This is
the only way out.
Oh, perfect.
It leads down. I will go first.
Oh, shit.
Sorry.
Michael?
Oh, shit.
Michael?
Hey, don't come!
What did he say?
Come down?
Okay.
Ugh!
You know what?
50,000.
What?
50,000 for not
telling everyone about
the crazy stuff you made
the doctor do here.
I think it's fair.
It's not the time.
Oh, really?
Why not?
40,000, okay?
Mm, no.
50,000 is okay.
Deal?
Deal.
Okay.
Go.
Aah!
Michael, come on!
Okay.
Woman: Help me!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Hello? Help me!
- Now what?
- We have to help her.
Help me!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Help me!
Help!
Thank you.
- Come.
- Daniel, come.
Thank you so much.
It's okay.
Yeah, what?
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?
We have to go. No, no, no.
Daniel?
It, uh...
it attacked her.
It got her.
There was nothing
I could do.
And you...
are you okay?
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
Okay.
We must go.
Come.
Come!
Finally!
Hello! Over here!
No, wait, wait!
Because risk of contamination,
everyone who tries to
leave will be sh...
Quick, quick!
Aah!
Go, go!
Help me
move this shit.
Come on, hurry up.
Look.
Fuck.
Let's keep moving.
You're bitten?
You think
I'm infected?
But it's... it's not
a human bite.
An animal can infect
you just as well.
Come on.
Wait, wait, Alison.
Come on, guys.
Come on. Come on.
Wait! No, come on.
No, look!
We have to move.
If we stay, we all die.
Now!
Wait, wait!
Fuck.
Fuck it.
Here.
Guys, I've found
another way.
I need your help.
Come on.
Here.
Here. It's here.
- Go, go.
- Okay.
Go, come on!
Go!
Okay.
Yeah!
Only one of us
can get up there.
You don't
look too good.
How do you feel?
I'm infected, I guess.
I'll make sure
she survives.
Okay, you go.
Help me.
Go.
Michael?
No! Move, move move.
It's too late,
it's too late. Go, go, go.
No, no!
Poepie! Michael! No!
Look at me.
Look at me.
No!
Look at me.
He was infected.
No.
It's better this way.
You don't have to watch him
turn into a monster, okay?
Okay.
Wait! Wait for me!
Daniel, catch!
You've been bitten.
You're infected, too.
You...
You motherfucker.
Alison!
Okay, come on.
No!
No, I don't want go!
Alison.
Let me explain you something.
No!
You have
to survive this, huh?
That's what he wanted for you,
that you stay alive.
Okay?
Okay?
Okay.
Come on.
Can you drive?
It hurts too much.
Are you okay?
You look like shit.
No, no, I'm fine.
You can relax now.
We made it.
We are alive.
You were infected
the whole time?
I'm still me,
but not for long.
What the fuck? Stop.
No.
This is the last thing
I want to do before I die.
No! No!
No, get off of me!
Let me finally
feel those knockers.
No!
Oh, fuck.
Shit.
Go.
You want me
to bite you?
Because that will happen
if you keep on wasting our time.
Oh, shit.
Shit.
Okay.
Poepie?
Dr. Krawczyk: Patient Zero,
she was also in program,
but she was contained.
I don't know how
she could get out.
Somehow, I just wanted

That's why we did

To make the world

To make the world
