Lots of people around now.
See you.
Screenwriter & Director: Jia Zhangke
We're seeing off the cold winter
and greeting the final spring of
the 20th century.
Our first steps on the journey
to welcome the 21st century's
new dawn!
See spring's first footsteps!
The Fenyang Spring Festival Gala
starts here!
And now...
Please enjoy
the Yangge Umbrella!
I wish my cheekbones
were smaller.
You study yourself closely.
Right.
When will you start studying me?
Study you? Are you a problem?
A geometry problem or
a algebra problem?
Either way, a problem.
Studying takes time.
Boss Zhang, you made it.
Yeah, I got here.
- Where have you come from, Jinsheng?
- Taiyuan.
I hear your coal mine's doing
well this year.
Our boss is desperate with
the low price of coal.
When it bottoms out, I'll buy it.
I bet you will.
How's your gas station doing
this year?
Okay... We're too busy bundling up
all the cash.
Great!
No false modesty, then!
Gotta go...
We should do lunch sometime.
Why did you bother to come?
I thought you were leaving?
Won't you see me off?
Won't you?
What is wrong?
Are you serious?
Getting rich has gone
- to your head.
- Won't you?
Come on...
Not a care in the world!
Look, that's my car.
It's red!
- You're showing off!
- How could I?
Looks good.
Pretty damn cool!
Just right for the new century!
Take us for a spin sometime?
Sure!
Hong Kong has the best views...
Hong Kong hell,
I'll drive you to America!
Spend some dollars!
You have to cross the Pacific
to get there.
My geography was never great...
I need you to tutor me.
Forget America.
Macau returns to China very soon.
Just take us to Macau...
- Okay, Liangzi?
- Fine by me.
You bet! It will be on me.
Take it easy.
Doing great, Erxiao!
Hey, Xiao Yue!
Our hometown is Fenyang,
by Dragon's Gate
Famed for our mountains
and rivers
A purple haze rises
from Wenfeng pagoda
We step proudly
into the new century!
A purple haze rises

Left foot of the clutch...
Right foot slowly on the gas.
On the gas!
Change gear!
Don't yell! You  scare me!
Look forwards!
Turn... Turn left.
Turn... Slowly.
Turn right.
Turn right!
- I can manage!
- Turn left!
You're insured, right?
<b>Yellow River, Ninth Cove</b>
I'm so sorry.
Sorry... I'm terribly sorry.
Never mind, I can deal with it.
- You must be upset.
- I told you, it's nothing.
You can rely on German technology.
It's okay?
Okay.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's German technology.
But you have a Chinese body.
Will the car still go?
Can we get back?
- If not you can push it!
- No problem.
Come on, let's make some noise.
Okay.
Let's do it.
Tao...
Let's do without Liangzi next time.
What do you mean?
Isn't two nicer
than three?
You're being small-minded.
It has nothing to do with that.
Then what?
Is it a geometry problem? Or algebra?
It's a triangle problem.
Isn't a triangle more stable?
What did you learn in middle school?
I graduated in law from Shanxi
University! By correspondence course.
So talented!
They didn't want you for
a higher degree?
They underestimated me.
Such self confidence!
Sanming...
Have a quick bath and
come back for a drink.
I've brought some braised pork
from home.
Great! Then don't hang around.
- Busy, Liangzi?
- Jinsheng! What brings you here?
Business.
I've just bought this coalmine.
Can it make a profit?
The price of coal is so low.
You don't get it,
it cost me next to nothing.
Help me run the place.
Don't just run the helmet store.
You deserve better, no prospects here.
Liangzi...
What are we going to do?
About what?
I like Tao too.
Then tell her so yourself.
I'll make it plain...
Just stay away from her.
You have no chance with her.
Let's see what an elite face
looks like.
I'm telling you this as a friend.
Piss off.
Okay...
From now on, our friendship is over.
And you'd better get the
fuck out of my mine
Don't you worry.
The day I beg you for a living,
I'll be dead.
I see.
You've got balls.
Take care of yourself.
- Hello.
- Hey, Liangzi.
- How's business?
- Not bad.
Hey Liangzi. Not working today?
Dad...
- You're back late.
- Had a couple of extra students.
- I have to call someone back.
- Okay.
Liangzi, watch the shop for me.
Hey, you!
Come on in!
Look around.
- Anything special?
- Can I see your stereos?
Sure, we have a good choice.
This one has a 3-disc tray...
Two cassette slots, a radio...
- Like to hear it?
- Sure.
- Let's try a CD.
- Fine.
Nice sound, isn't it?
I'm famished...
You two want some?
- Good bass sound, right?
- Not bad.
- Lovely song... Who is it?
- Sally Yeh.
It's lovely...
I wish I knew Cantonese.
Come back if you want anything.
Take care.
- Chopsticks.
- Okay.
Jinsheng, try one.
Wasn't that a great song?
- I made them, how's the taste?
- Good, as usual.
- What's wrong with him?
- Who knows? He's the elite one.
I brought you something good.
- What is it?
- Hair Beauty, it's an elite product.
Really?
It creates ten or more styles.
Thank you.
- Have some more.
- Is there enough?
What's the matter?
You asked for it?
Did you buy it?
Or borrow it?
What's the matter?
Jinsheng...
Have you gone crazy?
Why are you following me?
What is the matter?
You really don't know?
Or are you pretending?
What do you mean?
You eat from the same bowl as him,
like a couple!
I offered you some, but you
- refused.
- Disgusting!
You are being disgusting.
You must stop hanging out with him.
Who do you think you are? What right
have you to tell me what to do?
You're hurting me.
I don't get it.
You're hurting me
because I care for you.
So you've made your decision.
We are still good friends.
Come on, Liangzi...
Are you on Viagra?
Following her around all day?
Liang Jianjun!
Playing it rough, huh?
You two make it hard for me.
Missing him already?
See you.
Boss Zhang, long time no see.
Do me a favor...
What is it?
Get me a gun.
A gun?
Sorry, there's no way.
How long will the dog live?
The guy said fifteen years,
if it's treated well.
Fifteen years...
Takes us to 2014.
That's right.
So we'll be turning forty
when it dies.
Why say that?
Can't you say something nice?
You'll always be 18.
Don't move!
What is this for?
To blow up that bastard Liangzi.
Are you crazy?
Are the peach buns dry yet?
Not yet.
Peach buns are white and
tasteless these days.
The ones your mother made
were much better.
The flour smells different, too.
I'll have to go to Shahe
again in July.
What's happening at your
old friend Wu's?
His daughter Lilin is pregnant.
The baby will turn one month in July.
Dad, I have a boyfriend.
Who?
Jinsheng.
You're not happy?
It's your business,
you decide if it's good or not.
I'll get some water.
Let's go home.
Come on!
Great! I'll take you
all bowling sometime.
That's fine.
Of course!
Can't you just turn it off?
But my phone brings good news.
Coal's gone up again,
another 100 per ton.
Stop that! Come on...
We're ready. Lovely lady, look at me.
Liangzi...
Liangzi...
Liang Jianjun!
Please page 72801.
My name is Shen.
Have him call me back.
In local news,
the Forestry Authority has sent up
twelve planes
to re-seed forest in the
Jinzhong-Luiliang district.
In other news, Shanxi district....
Liangzi...
I've been looking for you all day.
Seriously?
I'm getting married on May 26th.
Here's your invitation.
You absolutely must come.
I can't. I'm leaving.
Where are you going?
Dunno.
Hebei...
Henan, Inner Mongolia, wherever.
When will you be back?
Never.
You don't mean it, do you?
I'm going.
You won't even say goodbye?
I already did,
in the club the other night.
Baby Zhang Daole.
Are you really giving him that name?
Sure I am!
Zhang Daole.
Daddy will make you lots of dollars.
<b>MOUNTAINS MAY DEPART</b>
Okay, get ready for the photo,
move to the middle!
Move to the middle,
look this way!
Come on, closer together,
look this way!
Ready. 1, 2, 3, done!
<b>2014</b>
- Go to Daddy.
- Be good.
Breathe in.
Breath out.
Breathe in again.
Breathe out.
Breathe out.
Where do you work?
Underground... Mining.
I suggest you get another check-up
in a bigger hospital.
Migrant worker?
From where?
Let's go to the hospital first.
Surgery, chemotherapy...
They cost big money.
Then give me the numbers of your
friends and relatives.
I'll borrow money from them tomorrow.
Makes no sense.
Borrowing money is a serious matter,
I'd have to go in person.
- Where's your wife from?
- Handan.
Handan's okay?
The price of coal stays low,
the mine may close.
They're in trouble here too.
Small mines are prohibited now.
I've become a welder myself.
A welder? Skilled work!
You've just got back...
- If you need anything, just say.
- Sure.
You're back just in time.
I'm off to Beijing next month
for my visa.
Visa?
For Almaty.
China Petroleum is laying
pipelines there.
They need welders.
Almaty?
It's in Kazakhstan.
Just beyond Mount Tian.
I'm taking a chance.
I have to deposit 30,000 yuans.
Had to borrow it from my two brothers
and a couple of other friends.
It could take a year's salary
to pay them back.
I'm sure you'll manage.
- It will work out.
- Yeah.
Oil is a good business.
Zhang Jinsheng has gotten big.
He has investments in Shanghai.
He's a real capitalist.
But he and Tao are divorced.
Cheers.
Just say if you need help
with anything.
I'm fine.
Standing next to me is our
French groom Olivier.
With such a fragrant bride,
your future's bright,
your home is a home, riches are yours!
You'll be running the
Bank of China in no time.
On this joyful occasion,
I want to ask Olivier.
Are you happy?
I'm very happy.
- Louder please. Are you happy?
- Happy!
To celebrate the union of this
wonderful couple,
Shen Tao, close friend of the
bride Wang Ting,
is presenting them with
precious gifts.
His-and-hers iPhones!
Mrs Shen... Where are you?
- Mrs Shen!
- I'm here!
Congratulations!
Now I ask the couple to
thank Mrs Shen.
First bow!
Second bow!
Third bow!
Mrs Shen?
Mrs Shen...
Someone's asking for you outside.
Oh, thank you.
Shen Tao...
You are... ?
You don't know me.
I'm... Liangzi's wife.
Liangzi...
Liangzi is back?
Yes, he is.
How is he?
He's not good.
Not good...
Come in.
- You came.
- Yes.
Where's Liangzi?
He's a big boy.
- Oh, he's asleep.
- Just dropped off.
Liangzi...
you came back.
You should have told me.
Your's baby so cute.
He's alright.
And you? How are you doing?
Okay.
Where's your boy?
He's with Zhang Jinsheng.
Going to the International School
in Shanghai.
Not with you?
He won the custody.
And conditions are better in Shanghai.
Can you afford it?
Don't worry.
Thank you for helping.
It's really no big deal.
Do you still sing at the New Year
dance party?
Not any more.
I can't come up with good
lyrics any more.
Your keys.
He seems okay. He's from Yuci.
He is in the building industry.
He's a widower,
raising his daughter alone.
He has enough money to
take care of her.
A daughter?
Well, ask Tao to have a chat with him.
She's past forty,
it gets harder to find someone.
She can't stay single all her life.
She should have a family of her own.
You talk to her.
She won't listen to me.
Auntie...
You're back, Tao.
It seems the gas station
is doing well.
Yes, it's pretty good.
- We should be going, Dad.
- Lets.
You're off somewhere?
Dad's wartime friend has a birthday.
I'll drive him to the station
for the train to Shahe.
- I should be going.
- Please.
- Come and see us, Tao.
- Look after yourself, Auntie.
I'm leaving.
- Shall we, Dad?
- Let's go.
- You have your ID?
- Yes.
- Train ticket?
- Yes.
- Cellphone?
- Yes.
- Then let's go.
- Okay.
- Xiao Xing, watch the place for me.
-  Yes, ma'am, drive safely.
Old Wu?
I've arrived.
No rush, take your time.
I'll be in the waiting room.
Doctor.
The relative's here?
You are...?
I'm his daughter.
Please show me your ID.
Are you planning burial or cremation?
You'll be taking the body, right?
Yes.
Where's my dad?
Wait a moment,
I'll make the preparations.
Tao...
It's fixed,
the ambulance will drive him back.
But...
What is it?
They want 12,000,
including the road toll.
Gas excluded.
It's fine.
I'm very, very sorry...
that things turned out this way.
Don't say that.
Your birthday was spoiled.
Hello, are you Mrs Shen?
- I am.
- Please sign gere.
Thank you, please follow me.
Daole...
Why don't you talk to your Mama?
Call me Ma.
Mummy.
Mummy? Who taught you that?
Be grown-up! Say "Ma".
Ma.
That scarf makes you look girlish.
Let's go home.
- Okay, Mum...
- Sister, don't be so sad.
Mr Shen... has flown up to heaven.
But his features remain.
Alas, it is sad indeed.
His daughter cherishes his memory.
His grandson pays his respects.
Light incense!
Light incense for Grandad.
Kneel.
Kneel!
Kneel for Grandad!
Dad, Daole came back to see you.
- Mummy!
- Do you miss me?
What's happening there?
Your Dad and I went to the
consulate today,
the immigration paperwork is done.
Dad called the lawyer in Melbourne,
we've bought the house.
The white one?
That's right.
Can we see penguins there?
The penguins are on Phillip Island...
But there are kangaroos near
the house.
Kangaroos!
Kangaroos!
Yes, the house is by
a conservation area.
Your Dad has spoken to
the best local school.
It has the best soccer team
and the best dorm.
You'll have such a grown-up
life, Dollar!
The other boys will be Australians.
Amongst them,
you'll be speaking English in no time.
How does that sound?
Mama, smoking's bad for you.
You are truly Zhang Jinsheng's son.
You both like lecturing people.
- Dad's name is Peter now.
- Peter?
He even has a foreign name.
You're better off with your dad.
Stay with him in Shanghai.
You can go to International School
and then abroad.
Your Mama is no use to you.
Nobody can be with you all
through life.
We're fated to be apart.
Mummy...
- Have you eaten?
- Not yet?
Didn't I tell you to eat your
meals on time?
Dad's booked your flight back,
and I've booked your
favourite restaurant.
Out of here!
Let me speak to Zhang Jinsheng!
Thank you.
- Tao.
- Zhang Jinsheng...
Will you tell that woman not to speak
to my son in front of me?
- What?
- Do you two have no sense at all?
I need to book the ticket for Dollar.
The flight ticket?
No need. I'll book it myself.
Is that okay?
I'll get Daole back to you
safe and sound.
Okay? That's all.
Mama's made you some long dumplings.
Eat long dumplings, grow taller!
Like it?
Tastes good! Very nice.
Why's this train so slow, Mama?
Because it's the slow train.
Why didn't we fly or take
a fast train?
The slow train gives me a bit
more time with you.
Like the song?
This is the place Dad wants
to take me to.
I've made you a set of keys.
The big one's for the yard,
the small one for the house.
You should have a set of keys
to your home.
You'll always be welcome there.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Never seen you on the train before.
Yeah, I just moved in and
train is easier.
Oh... no wonder.
We learned about surname yesterday.
Which surname is...
Xing!
And as I have told you, there are
about 100 surnames in China,
such as Zhaoqian Sun Lee.
I think it's going to
take a little time
for you to remember
all those surnames.
Now, what about personal names?
You will learned about
personal names which is
Ming...
Dollar! Dollar... what's your
personal name?
Dollar is dollar.
Oh, I know. i think Dollar
means the US dollar.
And whoever gave you that name
must have been clueless,
since the US dollar has been
free fall for ages.
He should have called you, Renminbi.
What's your mother name?
I don't have a mother.
No mother, so what are you?
A Monkey King... Sun Wukong.
Come out from the stone, right?
I was a test tube baby.
You still need a mother for that.
What's your Chinese name, Mia?
I forgot.
Okay!
It was in 2014, eleven years ago.
The country was caught up in that
big anti-corruption campaign.
I went to Hong Kong and ran into
Xing at the Four Seasons.
He couldn't decide whether to
go back to Mainland China or not.
I called him "Xing" and
he was furious.
Why?
Because "Xing" sounds like the
word "Criminal" in Chinese.
Poor him!
I said, that's the name you
inherited from your Dad!
2014...
Happens to be the year
we left Shanghai.
I've just gone through customs when
I got a WeChat message...
saying that Xing was being prosecuted.
Jinsheng... You've been hiding
here long enough,
it's about time to go back.
We'll see.
Your kid has suffered so
much because of you.
- Yeah... How's boss Liu lately?
- He retired.
A safe landing.
Hi, key.
- Where's yours?
- I lost it.
Again?
Boys...
will be boys.
Can I have a word with you?
Talk.
No problem.
<b>... right now. I could be
doing anything.</b>
<b>Just wanna tell you that I plan
to quit college.</b>
<b>Don't even know what I wanna do.</b>
<b>Maybe just live for the moment,
simple as that.</b>
<b>I mean, nothing really interests
me right now.</b>
Hi... Peter.
You can do it all, can you?
You're the Top Gun?
Superman?
Who do you think you are?
- What?
- You say you can do anything?
That's not right.
Can't you learn your old
man's Chinese?
You understand "old man"?
Old man means Father.
I'm your old man.
The father of Zhang Daole.
Yeah...
You are my dad
but it's like Google translate...
it's your real son.
Dad...
- Hello...
- Hi...
Delivery!
Hi Dollar...
- You live here?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I told you I moved here.
Guess what, you are my first guest.
I'm not your guest.
You wouldn't want me.
I'm just making a delivery.
Whoever arrived is a guest.
- Come in!
- Okay.
- Here's your order.
- Come in.
May I?
Sure...
You're officially invited.
Okay!
We'll take a 10 minutes break.
And after that we
come back and then we can
listen to some classic
old Chinese songs.
10 minutes.
Cantonese?
It's Cantonese songs.
One of these old classic
from the 90's.
It seems like something
I have heard before.
Okay, many Cantonese songs there
sounds pretty much alike.
You are from Kwang Tung?
No, I'm from Hong Kong.
But I moved to Toronto in 96.
Why do you come to Australia?
Why did you come to Australia?
It wasn't my idea.
My dad wants us to come.
Then you're not a test tube baby.
A test tube baby still has parents.
Okay... then what's your
mother's name?
Don't remember.
- Hi!
- Hi!
You have a table for two?
Yes, this way please!
- Sir.
- Thank you.
Any jet lag?
You know me, I'm okay.
I travelled a lot.
Is it necesary for us to meet?
I think my lawyer makes everything
very clear in the letter.
You know a lot of details were missed.
When we were married,
I pay all the utilities bills.
My lawyer done some calculations.
He says you should covered
half those bills.
So... that's the way you want
to play it?
What about all the money I paid for?
Your clothes... your alcohol...
And not to mention all the
groceries in the house.
Maybe I should start doing
some calculations too.
Hello?
It's me... Dollar.
I didn't order delivery.
I'm not here delivering.
I'm here as your guest.
Come in.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Haven't eaten, ain't you?
Yeah, come in!
Sorry you have to see all
those back there.
I didn't see anything.
He's my ex-husband.
You don't have to tell me.
I know about sex also.
Really?
So... how old are you?
You know... You shouldn't let
these things bug you.
They are best forgotten!
Very true.
That's just my story.
Your story... his story.
It's really nothing new.
So... shall we eat?
Of course!
My dad.
Hello.
I really need to talk to him.
Could you translate for us?
- Please?
- Sure.
Hello.
Who are you?
A friend...
I am Dollar's friend.
So you want to hear all about
our family problems?
I think he wants to talk with you,
so he asked me to translate.
Shoot!
I want to move out and quit college,
there's nothing in the world
that really interests me right now.
I mean... I could be doing anything.
He wants to move out and quit college.
Nothing interests him,
so he could end up doing anything.
I have just one question for him.
If he moves out,
where's he going to live?
Who do you think you are? How will you
survive without a college degree?
Where did you pick up all this shit?
Just one question, where are
you going to live if not here?
And... what're you going to live on if
you don't even have a college diploma?
I'm free to do what I want.
He wants to have
his freedom.
Do you know
what freedom is?
China doesn't permit
individuals to own guns.
But Australia just changed
the law, you can buy guns.
I now own a pile of guns,
but no-one to fire them at!
So what's freedom?
Freedom is bullshit!
Your dad says
freedom can be interpreted in
many different ways.
You know what...
just go play with your guns.
I don't need your permission.
I'm...
getting the feeling of dejavu.
Yeah...
Here... you're driving and
I'm your passenger.
I have see this before.
You're daydreaming.
Didn't you says sometimes recalled
the previous incarnation?
I don't believe in reincarnation.
Live's just repeat itself.
That's why you find it familiar.
I really have lived this
moment before.
Okay...
Look, there's the Twelve Apostles.
When I first came, there were eight.
Now... there's only three.
What's this?
That's my secret.
I wouldn't ask then.
My mum...
she gave them to me.
There are the keys to my home.
What's your mum like?
I haven't seen her
since I was seven.
She's still alive?
As far as I know,
As far as you know,
so you remember her?
Her name is Tao
like waves.
You should go back to visit her.
It's easy.
You'll say the same to you.
Yeah...
When I first came to Australia,
I always keep my phone on.
My mum was old,
I want her
to be able to find me
whenever she wants.
Then... Just go back to Toronto.
I don't have many calls to
make in the city.
Whenever the phone rings,
I just panic.
I'm so afraid something
bad had happen.
You know the hardest thing,
about love is caring.
I guess
we have to feel the pain
to know that we're in love.
Well, actually I'm looking
for... it's like...
goes from A city
to Beijing
and then from Beijing to Taiyuan,
that's the province of Shanxi
A week later, back to Beijing.
and then... Toronto?
I actually would highly
recommend flying business
because it's actually
a very long journey.
And it'll definitely going to be more
comfortable for you and your son.
I think economy is good enough.
We're actually having
having a very good promotion
at the moment for business class.
It's actually a very good deal.
Would you be interested in that?
Let's go!
Come on!
How about I let you think about it,
just so you know our company...
What's wrong?
Why is it so difficult?
If I was still 20 years,
I probably won't make
the suggestion of going back.
Now we're talking about
blood relation.
She's yours own mother and you're her
only son and it's not going to change.
But it has been so long.
Time doesn't changed every thing.
That's what it has taught me.
That woman there... she was so rude.
Yeah...
she thought we were mother and son.
How would you introduced me to your
mother when we get back to Fenyang?
Your teacher... your elder sister?
Your girlfriend?
I see.
I just...
