Yeah, I like animals better
than people sometimes.
Especially dogs. Dogs are the best.
When you come in, they act as if
they haven't seen you in a year.
The good thing about dogs. . .
. . .is they got different dogs
for different people.
Like pit bulls.
The dog of dogs.
Pit bull can be
the right man's best friend. . .
. . .and the wrong man's worst enemy.
You going to give me a dog,
give me a pit bull. Give me. . .
. . . "Raoul. "
Right, Omar?
Give me Raoul.
I fucking hate Raoul!
Shut the fuck up, asshole!
Son of a bitch don't
know when to shut up!
Hates Raoul.
Farley fucked up the list.
I can dig it.
I had a dog like that.
A poodle.
She didn't bark, though.
Pissed on the floor.
Hated that dog.
But if I was ever depressed. . .
. . .she'd lay her head in my lap. . .
. . .look up at me with
those big old eyes. . .
. . .and even though I thought
I hated that dog. . .
. . .I loved her.
It's like that, ain't it?
That love-hate thing.
No more goddamned talk!
I can't wait anymore, you hear me?
I want my wife!
I want her up here.
Or I'll do our daughter.
-Listen to me.
-No more talking.
I want that bitch,
or I'll do the girl.
I'm doing the
best I can here, man.
I'm not going to hurt her.
I just want her to see me
blow my brains out.
I want her to think about that. . .
. . .when she's sucking
that fat prick's cock.
Roman's losing him.
lf this guy goes, he takes
the girl with him. We must go in.
We'll give Danny another minute.
He's pulled out of worse.
Another minute, that girl
will be dead.
Unit 1 , prepare entry.
All units stand by for full breach.
You lost him.
Make entry.
Beck thinks you lost him.
Frost gave him the go-ahead.
That's not the play.
Omar's tight.
He can get a shot off
if they breach.
I can still talk to him.
I just need time.
HBT 1 , negotiator requests time.
Negative.
Team's in position.
Fuck it. I'm going in.
Don't. Don't pull this shit.
You'll give him another hostage.
You know another way to get
the gun off the girl's head?
Negotiator entering kill zone.
Keep him out.
Our men will lose objectivity
if he's in there.
This is Frost. Stand down.
Omar was a Marine, right?
-We have a shot?
-Bedroom.
Get Eagle and Palermo to that window.
Tell them to wait for my signal.
Put that motherfucker on his back.
Hellman, Allen, Argento.
When I'm clear, get the girl.
Just got word.
Your wife's here.
-Wife?
-Shut the fuck up.
I've been authorized to make the trade.
But I got to come in. . .
. . .make sure there's no
other hostages or surprises.
Fuck you!
I want to see her.
I got to come look. Then I can
bring in your wife, get the girl.
What if you're lying?
Then shoot me!
Fair enough!
Nice and slow!
You look around,
then I get my wife.
Or you fucking die!
Ready.
Move real slow.
This ain't about me or you. . .
. . .but I'll take you out
just the same.
He's in.
We got to play it out now.
Unit 1 , hold position.
Lock it.
Nice breeze.
Great day to be out.
Not cold. Cool, kind of brisk.
Too bad we got stuck in here.
You've seen everything, there's
no surprise. Let's do this.
I got to look in those rooms there.
Make sure nobody's there.
All right, move.
Football, huh?
Perfect day for it.
I ain't missed a Bears home game. . .
. . .since I left the Corps.
Oh, yeah? You were in?
Yeah. I did a tour in '73.
Semper fi, motherfucker.
I did 2 tours.
'68 and '69.
Well, hoo-fucking-rah, Omar.
Hoorah!
Not many Marines these days.
Everybody joins the Navy.
Got a visual on the suspect.
See? Nothing here, Lieutenant,
so now we make the trade.
Stay cool.
We got a one count.
Like I told you,
I got to check out everything.
A Marine and a sailor
are taking a piss.
The Marine goes to leave
without washing up.
Sailor says:
''ln the Navy, they teach us
to wash our hands. ''
The Marine turns to him, says:
''ln the Marines, they teach us
not to piss on our hands. ''
Move! Move!
HT's down!
Copy.
You all right?
You okay?
Thanks.
Yeah, boy!
Get down, get funky, get loose!
Do it, do it, do it!
You're a hoedown guy.
Now I've seen everything.
Which one is
the most pathetic out there?
-How you feeling?
-Not great.
-I want to talk to you.
-Cool.
Cut the music!
Take a wild guess
who's on the news again.
After 6 hours, hostage negotiator
Danny Roman risked his life...
...disarming the hostage-taker
to end the standoff.
You saved the day again.
It was a team effort.
Ijust talked the guy out.
Did he say anything?
He just wanted
to hog the spotlight!
I came close to busting your ass
because of what you pulled.
But because it'll never
happen again, I'll let it go.
All right, he's all talk.
Off the record,
that was one hell of a gutsy job.
Again! Congratulations.
Thanks, Chief.
Congratulations to you.
Were you really in the Marines?
No, I was in the Army and
I fucking hate dogs.
Despite how things worked out,
you put these guys in jeopardy.
lf you were taken hostage,
you would've fucked up everything.
Everybody lived, Beck.
Even you.
20,000 cops in Chicago.
Can't you take turns?
I was going to let Nate go in. . .
. . .but I knew Linda
would be pissed.
Nate's smarter than that.
I'm too smart
for my own good sometimes.
We got to talk.
It's important.
Just be a minute,
I promise.
Go tell your secrets.
I was approached
by someone recently.
He knows who took money
from the disability fund.
-Almost 2 million is missing.
-I know.
According to him, we know
the guys who took it. Cops.
Guys we might call our friends. . .
. . .stealing our own money.
I would've told you sooner,
but this is my first chance.
Who told you this?
I can't say.
But this guy knows what he's
talking about. He knows his shit.
He should go to Internal Affairs.
He thinks Internal Affairs
is involved.
Niebaum was mentioned.
He doesn't know what to do.
They offered to buy him out.
-And?
-He said he'd think about it.
We were at the academy, worked
Area 6 together, so he trusts me.
Dan, this guy. . .
. . .is really scared.
When did you find out?
Most of it last night.
I've worked on it a couple of weeks.
You're on the board.
You hear anything?
Not a thing.
They did an audit but it
didn't prove anything.
lf somebody's stealing,
we got to know who.
Tell this informant--
Shit!
Jesus Christ!
Officer Bald!
You blowing each other?
About to, till you showed up.
I know you're partners,
but everyone's looking for you.
Don't shine that light in here.
Can't a guy hold his partner's hand?
I'll let you girls be.
Wipe your mouth.
Order me a drink, big guy.
We'll finish this later.
Don't tell Linda.
Shit!
I don 't want
to fix up this house alone.
And with what you're doing....
Darling. . .
. . .that's the job.
It's not the job.
The job I can deal with.
It's how you do the job.
-Like what you did today.
-I'm fine.
This time.
I love that you do
these crazy things.
I just wish you'd differentiate
between crazy and stupid.
I know marriage is new to you. . .
. . .but coming home every night
is a big part of it.
Every night.
I promise. . .
. . .I will come home every night.
No matter what I have to do.
Every night.
What are you trying to negotiate?
I know you lie for a living.
Not right now.
Listen, listen.
Danny Roman is a married man now.
No more crazy shit, all right?
See that?
That's the bus.
The bus is going down the street.
''Crazy'' is on the bus.
What's vibrating, baby?
Nate's vibrating.
Go. Tell Nate I said hello.
And that I expect him to keep
you out of trouble from now on.
How you doing? Caught me.
Danny beeped me earlier.
What's going on?
Freeze!
Hands up!
Police officer!
Officer down!
He talked to his
informant last night.
Some guy he was at academy with
and knew from Area 6.
This guy said he knew what was
going down with the pension fund.
The informant didn't come
to you guys. . .
. . .because he thought
Internal Affairs was involved.
One of us?
Who was this informant?
He didn't tell me his name.
Somebody found out Nate was
investigating the fund. . .
. . .off this informant's tip
and they took him out.
Let's go back to the beginning--
I just found my partner
with his head blown off.
I'm not doing this!
You have to.
Fuck this!
Back off, Niebaum.
We'll do it some other time.
Is that the door?
You get it.
Shit!
They found the gun
that killed Nathan.
It's in the lake.
No fingerprints.
-I have a search warrant--
-The gun's serial number--
It was 1 of 3 guns
stolen from a dealer.
Two of the guns
were recovered by you.
-The third gun was just found.
-You got to be kidding.
-You serious?
-Nothing we can do.
We came as soon as we heard
about the warrant.
-Guys, go easy. He's one of ours.
-ln here.
I'm sorry about this, Karen.
We all know it's bullshit.
Just let them do their work
and get out.
It is bullshit.
He's standing over a dead cop. . .
. . .he had access to the gun
and he's on the fund's board.
Motive and opportunity.
Who are you, Niebaum?
Nate mentioned your name when he said
Internal Affairs was involved.
Now it's my name?
We're investigating too, and your
name keeps coming up. Wonder why.
Maybe Nathan found you stealing
money from the fund.
Inspector!
I think I got something in here.
Offshore accounts.
That shit's not mine.
You planted this shit!
Put it away.
Why are you doing this to me?
Chief, you don't--
Will you be charged
for the murder of Officer Roenick?
Make a hole here!
Come on, back up!
Give the guy a break!
Thanks.
How can you show your face here?
I knew you'd get somebody killed.
Nobody really knows
what happened, okay?
Come on, seriously.
What's going on, Danny?
We're hearing a lot of shit.
What?
Come on inside.
All right, everybody,
get back to work.
Sit down.
I'll be honest.
I don't know what to think.
But I don't have any choice until
this investigation is complete.
Your gun and your badge.
You know me.
I'm being set up.
Nate's informant knows
who's involved.
Help me find him,
and all this goes away.
We should keep going.
Mrs. Roenick, we should go.
I didn't do what they say I did.
We should go.
Fuck you, Danny.
Fuck Niebaum.
Fuck all of you.
You all killed him.
Don't stand in my face.
Don't say one more fucking word to me.
You took him away from me.
God help you, Danny.
You took him away from Jeremy.
Now you stand here. . .
. . .and you just live with that.
Mrs. Roenick.
Please, let's go home.
Danny, we need to go.
Come on, this way.
The papers found in your house:
Can you explain why you
had that kind of money?
You have no proof the money. . .
. . .was from the fund
or that he opened the accounts.
The money was well-laundered. . .
. . .but the last deposit matched
the last amount stolen.
I don't have offshore accounts.
The statements were in your home.
You were standing over the body.
Are you charging my client?
It's all circumstantial.
We have a gun linked to you. . .
. . .and a pair of gloves
from the water.
Which explains why your client
had no powder on his hands.
You know how this city feels
about corrupt cops.
I'll get a conviction
with my eyes closed.
Tell us where the money is,
who your partners were and maybe. . . .
I need to speak to my client.
I'll give you one day to make a deal.
You hear me?
One day. After that, there'll be
no deal to negotiate.
We'll arrest you and I'll see to it
you face the maximum penalty.
Be here tomorrow and have
a decision made.
What?
Understand that they have a case
that a jury will convict on.
I can't do any more for you.
Cut a deal.
Wait in the car.
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.
Please don't do anything crazy.
Crazy's on the bus, remember?
I love you.
I love you too.
Be right back.
I'm seeing Niebaum.
Could you wait?
I'll buzz him.
Wait, sir!
Hold on.
Roman. What can I do for you?
Man's got a right
to face his accusers.
-We need to talk.
-Go ahead, talk.
What's going on?
You killed your partner
and you're about to be indicted.
You're not answering my question.
Nate told me you were involved.
Look me in the eye
and say you weren't.
-Look me in the eye!
-For what?
Tell it to the judge.
We're finished.
Get him out.
You're not doing this!
Lock the door!
Don't make things
worse than they already are.
You, sit your ass down.
Sit!
This is my life here.
-I want answers.
-I don't have answers!
Put the gun down!
You don't feel like talking?
We'll stay here until you do!
It's your choice.
Because I'm not going to jail today.
Go!
Drop your weapon.
Drop it, Danny.
Guns down!
That was no accident!
The next one's for your head!
Get down here now!
Come on!
Everybody march over
to that desk over there.
Put your guns, cuffs,
keys, everything. . .
. . .on the desk and get out!
Let's go! Move! Move it!
-What are you doing here?
-The call's out on the city-wide.
-See what they're making me do?
-You just got married!
Think of Karen!
I am thinking about Karen.
Now that I think of it,
I'm glad you're here.
You just raised the ante.
Join the party.
God, this is crazy.
Take your guns off.
Put them on this table now!
I know you heard me say
both of them.
Listen to me.
It's not too late.
You're trying to talk me down?
This is crazy.
This isn't helping you.
Me and him have nothing
to do with this.
I've known you 20 years.
What are you doing?
I know I made you stay, but you
cannot monopolize the conversation.
You're not the scene
commander here. I am.
You're Niebaum's secretary.
What's your name?
Maggie, and I'm his assistant.
Maggie, don't be scared.
I'm familiar with situations
like this.
I'm not scared.
I've been mugged twice.
Guns are not new to me.
l'd rather avoid them
if I get the chance.
You won't have that chance this time.
And if you're his assistant,
you have everything to do with this.
But not me, bro.
I don't work for this pig.
-I'm not a cop.
-You're Rudy Timmons.
You're a rat for the rat squad.
You don't remember me?
I arrested you
for credit card fraud.
I remember you.
I remember you.
Hey, man!
You used to be a clean-cut boy in blue.
What happened to you?
That's what we're here to find out.
I wonder if they're out there.
Your partners, Niebaum.
The guilty ones.
My guys.
They'll come. . .
. . .scared shitless I'll get
the truth out of you.
And if they can't get me
they'll kill you.
Clear the perimeter.
Start evac.
Nothing moves on that river!
Locate the phone panel.
Lock down the elevator and stairwell.
Have Unit 2 hold outside
Internal Affairs.
They're here already.
Set up command on that barge
so the press can't get to us.
What do you got?
Elevators are locked down.
I got a concern.
He knows our tactics and we got
a big area to lock down.
What's our manpower?
We got personnel from
6 different districts.
But he'll still try to control
the environment.
We'll see who wins the race.
Perpetrator is an expert marksman.
He's an expert
in explosives and tactics.
Gentlemen, play this by the numbers.
Maintain your fields of fire.
Elevators.
Fucking Roman's up there, man.
He's got Frost inside.
Any chance to end this,
we take him out.
We're blind and
he's seeing 20/20.
I want visuals and audio
set up from 19 and 21 .
You're negotiating.
He'll eat Farley up.
Commander. . .
. . .if you want to talk to him. . . .
I may not have a choice.
Get him locked down first! ln the
meantime, get on the phone.
-Locate the building engineer.
-Right away.
Chief Travis.
Special Agent Grey.
This is Moran.
We're the FBl negotiators.
This federal building
is our jurisdiction.
He's one of ours.
We got this.
Fine with us. For now.
We got eyes.
Son of a bitch!
Camera 2.
He got all 6.
We got to see in that room.
No eyes, no ears.
We're running out of options.
-I want status reports now.
-Give me an update.
Somebody give me status.
Tell me what you see.
All shafts are locked down.
Blinds closed.
Visibility zero.
We contained him.
We have not.
He's contained himself.
He's cut us off.
Try the phone again.
See what he wants.
Talk.
I'm Rudy, so don't shoot me
thinking I'm him. Please.
Rudy, my name is Farley.
Please put Danny on.
Farley wants to talk to you.
I'll only talk to Chris Sabian.
He'll only talk to Chris Sabian.
If Sabian 's not here...
. . .in 20 minutes,
you die.
I don't want to talk
to anyone but Chris Sabian.
We heard you.
He said they heard you.
Who's Chris Sabian?
-I've heard of him.
-He's from the Westside.
Once he talked 55 hours.
Never forces tactical action.
I don't know how Danny knows him.
Find Sabian.
91 1 Chris Sabian.
Come on.
Talk to me.
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere,
so please come out.
You don't want me to.
I want to kill her.
I want you to come out
so we can discuss this.
You're not even listening.
I am listening to you.
You promised you'd come out.
So come on out, all right?
I don't want to do this
through the door.
I want to do something without arguing.
Let's get on the road.
Your clothes look fine.
They do.
According to some people,
I look fat in ski clothes.
That's not the word she used.
She used. . .
. . .a much worse word.
Honey, get off the phone!
Get off the phone.
Get off the phone.
I'm your father and I'm
very upset with you!
Try your sweater.
Get off the phone.
I want you to apologize to your
mother for saying she looks. . .
. . . ''wide. ''
That's not a good word.
How'd you like to be called wide?
Do you hear me? I'm serious!
I'm very angry with you!
Get off the phone!
Get off the phone.
Don't you make me--
I've talked a man out of
blowing up a building. . .
. . .but I can't talk my wife out
of a bedroom or my kid off a phone.
Because no one's standing
behind you with a big gun.
Well, that's debatable.
Hold on.
He's right here.
It's for you.
Sabian's 20 minutes out.
And we only got 15.
Call Danny and change
that deadline.
Tell him Sabian's on his way.
Sabian?
It's Farley.
I don't want to talk
to anyone but Chris Sabian.
He'll be here real soon.
We just need more time.
You don't have more time, Farley.
What are you doing?
This is serious.
Damn right it is!
So take me seriously!
We are. We are. We just. . . .
I just want to talk to you.
Wait, wait.
You think you can talk me down?
I need to. . . .
Tell me what you want.
You want a shot?
I'll give you a shot.
We got time before Sabian
gets here.
What do I want? Let's see.
Can I see a priest?
No, you can't.
That's good.
Don 't let me see a priest.
A priest would make me think
of death and you don't want that.
But you said ''no. ''
You can't say ''no. ''
Never use ''no'' in a hostage situation.
-Would you relax a little?
-I'm relaxed!
Here's some advice:
Never say ''no'' to a hostage-taker.
It's in the manual.
Will you say ''no'' again?
No.
Wrong answer! Eliminate ''no''
from your vocabulary.
Never use "no, " "don't, "
"won't" or "can't. "
The only option that leaves
is to shoot someone. Understand?
Yes.
Yes! Good! See, ''yes'' is good.
Say ''no'' again, I'll kill somebody.
Let's practice.
Can I see a priest?
You know what?
Can we just talk--
You wanted to talk!
We are!
Now can I see a priest?
I'll see what I can do.
That's good.
Now you're learning.
l'd like a submachine gun.
I'll look into that.
You're doing good.
Ever cheat on your wife?
-No.
-Watch yourself.
I'll kill someone.
Ever cheat on your wife?
Answer!
I'll see what I can do.
I'll have to think about it.
I'lI look into it.
You ever. . .
. . .dress up like a girl
and get spanked?
Look, all I want to do is talk to you.
I am talking!
Did you dress up like a schoolgirl
and get your ass spanked?
Have to look into that, Danny.
Nothing against you
dressing up like a girl. . .
...but I didn 't know that
about you.
This is really unproductive.
Unproductive?
You're right.
So tell me a joke, Farley.
You know anyjokes?
No? You just cost someone
their life! Game over!
Shot fired!
Shot fired!
Can anyone see?
Don't let him go.
You can't talk me down!
I won 't change the deadline!
Now get me Sabian!
You got 6 minutes, 42, 41 . . . .
Listen, Danny, is anybody hurt?
Is anybody hurt?
We're okay. Just don't say
''no'' no more, motherfucker!
-Everybody calm down.
-I'm so sorry.
I'm so fucking sorry.
Someone give me status.
Tell me what you see.
Visibility zero, sir.
Moments ago...
...a shot was fired in the
Administration Building.
We got the whole city
of Chicago watching this.
This could turn into a press nightmare.
What do we do if Sabian can't make it?
We got to remember
it's Danny upstairs.
We've worked with him 1 2 years
and don't really know what he's done.
We know what he's doing now.
I don't want this to get
personal for us.
He's obviously over--
Do you mind?
He's obviously gone over the edge.
This is not personal.
lf I thought sending my team in
would put more people in jeopardy. . .
. . .I wouldn't consider it.
I don't want to go in there.
But it's our best option.
He can't be talked down.
They'll get us out. Don't worry.
Danny won't hurt anybody.
No one knows what this
crazy fucker is going to do.
This has nothing to do
with me and Maggie.
You get him to let us go.
Once you familiarize yourself
with the chains of bondage. . .
. . .you prepare your own
limbs to wear them.
Abraham Lincoln said it.
I believe it.
So you've got to get me
the fuck out! Now!
Keep quiet, Rudy.
We'll handle this.
Don't tell me to be quiet.
Don't say you'll handle it.
None of you ever been
in a situation like this before.
Shut the fuck up.
Fuck you!
-Prick.
-That's enough!
He'll hear you.
He's got the gun, so he's in charge.
Both of you pipe down.
Let Maggie go. She's not involved.
And she's a woman--
I didn't ask to be let go because
I'm a woman. I hate that crap.
Me and him had nothing
to do with this.
It's between cops.
We have nothing to do with this.
I'm not some dirt merchant
loose in the street anymore.
I got a nice lady friend
that I'd like to get back to.
And she has got this kid, Albert.
Super kid, Dan.
Great kid.
What do you think you can do?
Look at that screen.
They think you're a killer.
They'll try to take you out.
What do you think Sabian can do?
He can't stop this.
What about you, Frosty?
You think I'm a killer too?
Come on!
You've known me for 20 years.
Think I killed Nate?
I don't know what to think.
I'll tell you this:
This is not helping.
Schoolgirl.
You still sweating
that ugly display you gave us?
Stop kicking yourself.
We all have our bad days.
Stop trying to figure out
how to get in here.
Palermo...
. . .take that toothpick out
of your mouth.
Wouldn 't want you to swallow it
if something goes down.
That's right, sports fans. . .
. . .it's me, Danny Roman.
The man upstairs.
Just wanted to say hello before
the curtain goes up.
You're wondering why we're here.
It's simple.
We're here to find out
who took our money...
. . .and who killed Nate. . .
. . .because it wasn't me.
There's some bad cops among us. . .
...and today we'll find out
who they are.
I know how that sounds.
You're thinking...
... ''He's gone. He's a murderer. ''
But I'm that same guy
you trusted your lives with. . .
. . .played softball with,
went drinking with.
The same guy you invited. . .
... to your kid's baptism, Tonray.
The guy who saved Palermo...
... when that sniper had a bead
on him at the stadium.
This is good.
He's trying to Stockholm us
so we won't take him out.
I want--
No, I need you guys. . .
... to understand I had
no choice here.
My life was being stripped away from me.
First, they kill Nate.
Then they took my badge.
Then you guys.
Next...
. . .they were going to take away my
wife by sending me to prison.
And that. . .
. . .I cannot take.
I can't live without--
Put yourself in my position.
What else could I do?
Gaines, get word out.
We're switching to frequency 3. Now!
I tried to tell everyone I was set up,
but no one listened.
Now you have no choice.
You got to listen,
because we won't leave. . .
. . .until I find out who set me up.
Let me warn you:
Whoever killed Nate is frightened
Niebaum might know something.
They'll try to end this quickly.
Another warning:
I know the rules of engagement. . .
...so don 't test me.
You got 4 minutes
to get Sabian here. . .
. . .or you'll find out
just how serious I am.
Look me in the eye.
Right here.
Now, tell me. . .
. . .when did you find out Nate
was investigating the fund?
I first found out. . .
. . .after he was killed.
You're lying.
And I know you're lying.
You know it?
You can read my mind?
No, I'm not.
I'm reading your eyes.
The eyes can't lie.
Didn't you know?
A quick lesson in lying.
This is what us real cops do.
We study liars.
Example:
I ask you something visual,
like your favorite color. . .
. . .your eyes go up and to the left.
Neurophysiology tells us
they go that way. . .
. . .as you access your visual cortex.
So you're telling the truth.
lf your eyes go up and right. . .
. . .you're accessing the creative
centers and you're lying.
Let's try this again.
Your favorite TV show?
I'm not going to play
your stupid game.
You afraid we'll catch you
in a lie?
When did you find out
Nate was investigating the fund?
After I spoke with you.
That's a lie if I've ever seen one!
-Fuck you! I never blinked my eyes!
-You didn't have to blink.
Your body language says you're lying.
He's nervous.
What do you expect?
Shut up!
You know how this works!
It's not just your eyes.
It's everything.
Cough, sneeze, cross your legs,
scratch your ass. . .
. . .they're all telltale signs.
You can't cheat.
You can stare with those
dead-ass eyes all you want.
You can't beat the system.
One last question:
Who killed Nate?
You.
I don't know. I couldn't tell.
Up, down, right, left. . . .
What now? Card tricks?
Shut the fuck up!
You knew Nate was investigating
the fund and you killed him.
You could've ended this.
I guess you don't want to.
That's too bad.
That's really too bad.
Because Danny was just
starting to like you.
Tell Danny to hold the fuck on.
-You don't want to do this.
-How do you know?
lf I killed Nate, how do
you know I don't want to do this?
Danny Roman?
This is Chris Sabian.
Good timing.
You made it just in time.
I got lucky. Traffic was light.
Glad you came.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
What's it been? 2 years?
Not since both our teams
showed up for that north side gig.
You pulled rank and ran my boys out.
Two negotiators on the same site. . .
...never work.
What's this?
The exception that disproves the rule?
You do your job, I do mine. . .
. . .maybe we both walk out in one piece.
Here's the million-dollar question:
Why you?
Exactly.
I don't want to go into that now.
We'll talk about that later.
This is our first date.
The courting period.
What do you do when you're
not talking guys like me down?
I'm a homebody. I spend a lot
of time with my family.
My kid.
I read a lot of books.
I watch a lot of old movies. AMC.
You got a satellite?
They show old westerns.
Westerns?
I like comedies.
I did like Shane though.
That's a good one.
Shane 's a good one.
l'd have picked one where
the hero lives at the end.
Like Rio Bravo...
. . .or Red River.
That's the wrong movie.
Shane lives. At the end he's
riding off and that kid. . . .
-Brandon--
-de Wilde.
Brandon's calling his name:
''Shane, come back! Shane! ''
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but Shane died.
That's an assumption.
It's a common mistake.
ln the final shot,
he slumps over his horse.
He doesn't look back
because he's dead.
He's shot.
Doesn 't mean he's dead.
You think Butch and Sundance live too?
You never see them dead,
but they're surrounded.
Now you're a history buff?
I read histories and biographies.
Don't believe everything you read.
I don't read just one book.
I try to read all the books
on a subject. Get the facts.
Then decide what really happened.
Get all the facts.
That's smart.
You're better at this
than Farley.
Let's get back to business.
First, my list of demands.
One: I want my badge
brought here.
Two: If I die, I want a
departmental funeral.
No one's dying.
Three: Find the informant.
He can clear my name
and he knows. . .
. . .who's running
this conspiracy.
Four: I want to know
who killed my partner.
lf neither the informant
or killer is found in 8 hours. . .
. . .I'll kill one hostage an hour.
Five:
I want to talk to you
face to face now.
-Commander's upstairs?
-You can talk to me.
You're the chief?
Nice to meet you.
You're Beck?
You're. . .?
All right. Vest.
You're going up?
-Why didn't you talk him down?
-He expected that. His sheet.
Why'd he ask for me?
We hoped you could tell us.
Psych evaluation?
-That's Tonray.
-Thinks he's innocent.
We may have to go tactical.
We put together a plan.
lf we distract him, we can
send in an infiltration team.
-Let's wait on that.
-Wife's here!
How is he? Has he hurt anyone?
Who's talking to him?
Karen, he's okay.
-He asked for Chris Sabian.
-I'm Chris Sabian.
Do you know Danny?
He didn't do those things.
You have to help him.
I don't know about his
guilt or innocence.
I'm here to get him out safely.
lf you want to help. . .
. . .go with Tonray, answer his
questions, and we'll drive you home.
No! No! I'm not going home.
You bring too much tension
and emotion to the scene.
I am not leaving my husband.
All right, fine.
Help me help him.
I have to get up there now.
Answer Tonray's questions
and then stay in case we need you.
Come with me and talk.
lt'll be all right.
How do I get up?
Freight elevator to 18.
Walk the rest.
What is this? This is a
shaft off Internal Affairs?
It's access to the steam pipes.
It's unusable.
Get his badge.
Shut off the heat.
He may deal a hostage to get it back.
What channel we on?
Chief, I want to show you something.
Take me.
Take him. Come on.
I got the asthma.
You know?
You can't put me
in bad situations, man.
For chrissakes.
Why you always pick on me?
I mean, who am I?
Charlie Brown?
You know what Nietzsche says:
Even the strongest have
their moments of fatigue.
And I'm fatigued.
I'm fucking fatigued.
You okay?
Do I look okay?
I got a gun pointed at my head.
Nice pants.
Shut up, Mr. Blackwell.
Get over here.
-You working?
-Sort of.
I was negotiating a truce
between my wife and daughter.
That's easy by comparison.
It wouldn't surprise me.
You shut off the heat.
You know how this works.
Yeah, I do.
Next time you try to bluff,
charge your cell phone.
You want to tell me
what I'm doing here?
I wanted to tell you
face to face I'm not crazy.
I'm doing this
to prove my innocence.
Anything I can do
to help you get out--
Don't patronize me!
You don't think I'm innocent.
So don't tell me you want to help.
Like I'm a second-rate HT.
I'm sorry. My mistake.
You are sorry. Get out.
Call when you want to talk.
I'm ready to talk.
You're right.
I don't know if you're innocent.
You could've done everything
they say you've done. I don't care.
This isn't a way to prove
your innocence.
And now you got hostages.
Let me tell you:
Hurt them, you burn whatever
currency you got to deal with me.
They're all I care about.
You leaving here is second.
Do I make myself clear?
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
Now answer my question.
Why am I up here?
Before Nate died, he told me
the men involved are from my precinct.
Guys I know.
-Guys I might call friends.
-And?
And you're not.
When friends betray you. . .
. . .the only people
to trust are strangers.
Lock the door! Get out!
Hurry up. Lock it!
Hurry up!
Hold it there.
What happened? I've lost him!
He's back in!
Come on!
Go!
Get up! Get up!
Drop the gun! Drop them!
Put it down!
You're jeopardizing the life
of this hostage!
Drop your guns!
Sniper team, can you see Roman?
Look for the shot.
The target is acquired.
-Put it down!
-Drop the weapon!
Drop the gun! Drop it!
Put it down! Now!
Put it down!
You'll get this man killed!
Drop your weapon! !
Put your gun down!
Tell him! Tell him, Frost!
Put the gun down now!
Drop your weapon!
Green light. Take the subject out.
I can't believe this.
Palermo, take the subject out.
Palermo, take the subject out!
Copy!
Don't tell me ''Copy'' !
Pull the trigger!
Copy.
I can't take it.
Pull the trigger!
-Negative, I can't take the shot!
-Have a heart!
Fuck!
You're relieved.
Kick it!
-Looks like the HT's speech worked.
-Stand back.
We have this.
Is this your command or his?
You had him distracted.
We saw an opportunity to end it.
You put the hostages at risk!
That's not how I work!
First, we talk!
It was my call.
We don't feel
he can be talked down.
I've been here a half-hour!
How do you know?
With all due respect, sir. . .
. . .I've kept a zero casualty rate
for 5 years.
This kind of action is a last resort!
This is not your command, Sabian.
My command is to get
those people out safely!
You don't know this man!
He's manipulating the situation.
Look at Palermo.
He's going to fuck with everyone
if we give him enough time!
And he knows you'll do it.
He knows how you work.
He's got a point.
We have a chain of command.
Your chain of command
gave Danny 2 more hostages.
Officers! Will you take responsibility
if he kills one? I don't!
They're waiting to take over.
You want that to happen?
This'll be easy for you.
Roman asked for me
and he'll get me.
We'll do it my way
or I walk.
I got no truck with leaving
you with this responsibility.
It's your decision.
Or they'll take it over!
You have command for now.
But I'm still the ranking officer
on the scene. . .
. . .and I'll be watching.
Good. You watch.
Now do me a favor.
lntroduce me to our team.
Attention. . .
. . .this is your chief, Al Travis.
l'd like to introduce
the negotiator, Chris Sabian. . .
. . .who, as of now, has full command.
I'm Chris Sabian.
All decisions now go through me.
No order is valid unless I give it.
No action is taken unless I approve.
I know we understand each other
and that we'll work together...
. . .to end this safely and quickly.
It didn't work, Beck!
I'm still alive, motherfucker!
Danny, it's Chris.
Listen to me.
Pick up the radio and talk to me.
Nothing! Look!
You guys with the cameras,
you get that?
All I asked for was time,
and they tried to take me out!
It is the policy of the
Chicago police. . .
. . .to resolve hostage situations. . .
. . .with regard for
the preservation of life!
Get his wife.
You want my blood?
Take my blood! Come on!
Here it is! Take it!
They have a shot!
We can end it!
You want to shoot him
on television?
Move the crowd.
Clear the area.
Go ahead, take my blood!
Go ahead, take the shot!
I'm getting close to the truth
and they want me dead. . .
. . .just like Nate!
Give me the order.
-Give the order!
-Wait.
Don't take the shot!
What do I have to do
to be heard?
Am I going to have to
hurt somebody to get respect?
All right, I will!
Don't do that.
Don't take this to the next level.
Can he hear me?
Think you can come in here
and just shoot me?
They send you to kill me and you
think you can get away with it?
I know you're one of them.
Now you're going to pay for
doing that!
Danny, do not...
. . .hurt anyone.
I am in command here.
No one will breach.
No one will come in.
No one will do anything without
my authority. I'm in control.
You're not in control!
They're not listening to you!
So I'm going to show them
why they should!
One of those sent to kill me
will die!
Every time you try to come in,
this will happen!
Move!
Move!
Get in there!
Get in there!
Down! Down!
Are you one of them, Scott?
Did you set me up?
Is that why you want me dead?
Danny, it's Karen.
Danny, please talk to me.
Do not. . .
. . .come in here. . .
. . .again.
Karen, I'm sorry.
Cut the electric.
Cut it now.
After hours of little action,
we've seen a flurry of activity...
...on the 20th floor of the building.
And it looks like
more action now.
They've cleared the barricades.
Looks like federal sedans, FBI
agents arriving on the scene.
This is a major development.
Until now...
... this negotiation has been handled
by the Chicago police.
The feds are either
coming to aid the negotiations...
...or more likely,
to take over the negotiations.
But that's speculation. All we
know is they're now on the scene.
What have you done?
You've just fucked yourself.
You killed a cop!
You killed an innocent man!
He wasn't innocent.
He's one of them.
He tried to kill me.
I told you all
when I came in here. . .
. . .I wasn't leaving
till I got the truth.
I don't care how long it takes.
You could've prevented this.
Why don't you just
tell him something?
Why don't you tell him anything?
Inspector?
5 years, Maggie.
You must know something.
Please, Inspector.
He lied when he knew it would
cost someone their life.
lf you know something,
you tell me now.
His files are on the computer.
I'm not supposed to know.
There's a lot of stuff on there.
Probably could help you.
Unlock yourself. Get the computer.
I saw your troops.
I don't want you
and the ATF taking over. . .
. . .without any evidence.
I don't want you going in.
Before the press starts
framing the story, I want an hour.
-Phone's ringing.
-I know.
-Another hour. Guarantee.
-Will you answer the phone?
You have one shot.
Will you get that?
Sorry to interrupt.
What took so long?
I'm busy.
Never keep a hostage-taker waiting.
Relax. He'll call back.
Who you think you're dealing with--
lf you have a problem,
let us handle this.
Tell him I'm on my way up.
Get the phone.
-Sabian--
-No, it's Far--
Danny, Chris is on his way up.
We need to reopen negotiations.
You want something from me?
I want the electricity on.
You want something. . .
. . .from me.
Killing a man gives you
power to negotiate?
Why is that?
You think you know me?
You think you can trust me?
Think you know what I'll do?
I'll give you time?
Don't count on it.
I'm the only thing between you. . .
. . .and an army that's itching
to take you out.
So you tell me, Danny.
Why should I get in their way?
Make me believe
why I should deal with you. . .
. . .ever again.
I still have hostages.
They can still be punished
for your mistakes.
Did you just threaten me?
That's all I need to walk out.
The rules of engagement state:
''Don't breach if the hostage-taker
is willing to kill. ''
I've proved
I'm willing to do that.
Things are not what they seem.
You saw what they did.
They didn't tell you they were
coming in because they want me dead.
One more gun goes off. . .
. . .and I'll give the order myself.
Understand?
Don't think you've bought
anything by asking me here.
Because you need to remember
I am a stranger to you.
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.
I need the electricity. . .
. . .to use the computer
and look at Niebaum's files.
I also want food and blankets
for the hostages.
I'll need a hostage.
Nothing less.
Take Frost.
Turn the electricity on.
Could you repeat that?
I'm walking out with a hostage.
Do what I say.
Turn the electricity back on.
Credit card fraud and electronic theft.
That's you, Rudy?
I got caught for credit card fraud
and electronic theft.
But the list goes on.
I could sit here all night
and get nothing.
What security has this thing got?
F1 , enter.
C. . .
. . .dash I dash COM.
G-9.
Run a search.
Look for anything to do
with the disability fund.
There's a lot of added security here.
It's not bad.
Just outdated by 6 months.
Fucking cops.
Always 2 steps behind.
He's looking for people
to believe in him.
I didn't help the situation.
Then he shoots Scott.
Christ.
I couldn't do anything.
Could you tell me about Danny's
relationship to the fund. . .
. . .his case and this informant?
Anything you overheard or know. . .
. . .that might be pertinent
or of use to me?
Sure.
''Disability fund.
Subdirectories: Wires and taps. ''
Click on wires.
Lots of wires.
-What are these numbers?
-Badge numbers.
Scroll down.
Stop.
Back up one.
Nate's badge.
Click that.
They did an audit,
but they didn 't prove anything.
That's my voice--
Somebody's taking our money.
We got to find out who.
Oh, shit!
You son of a bitch.
You were tapping Nate.
You knew he was
investigating the fraud.
-You lied!
-Fuck you!
You killed him because
he was getting close.
There's only one killer
in this room.
You're the killer!
Scroll to October 1 2th,
the night before Nate was killed.
-There's one recording.
-Click on it!
Will you talk to me?
It's that case I'm working on.
I'll be a minute.
Sorry, honey.
I want to see if he's here.
I don 't want to talk on the phone.
It's not....
I'll see you soon, okay?
I'lljust be a minute.
-I love you.
-I love you too.
He was going to see his informant.
What are you talking about?
Before Nate was killed he said
he'd talked to his informant.
You knew that too.
What's going on here?
Why can't you find this guy?
You got to be looking for him
so you can shut him up too!
You don't know who he is.
Linda wouldn't tell you where
they went that night.
Because she thinks you're
as guilty as I am!
-Go ahead.
-Is this a private line?
You need it to be?
Sorry.
Go ahead.
I need you to talk
to Nate's wife.
About what?
I found taps that prove
Niebaum's been lying.
I heard something
you need to ask Linda about.
You and only you.
What do I ask her?
Where she and Nate went
the night before he died.
Who he talked to.
lf she tells you who he saw,
I'll give you another hostage.
lf she tells you nothing,
you get nothing.
Have my hostage ready.
Great.
-Excuse me.
-I got to go.
Can we have a word?
Hellman and Beck studied the blueprints.
They have a suggestion.
You take suggestions?
Hellman thinks we can get a team
in the vent above Roman.
We suggest getting men in place
for a crisis entry. Just one unit.
Only a precaution.
We can control him
if he starts shooting hostages.
We can go in strong,
2-3 seconds from bang to bullets.
It's not a full breach. We're concerned
he'll kill one of our men.
That may not mean much to you,
but it means a lot to us.
Beck, please.
I want to be ready to go
if we need to.
I agree with the commander.
And I do care if our team is injured.
But they don't move without
my authorization. Understood?
-Gentlemen?
-Without a doubt.
We'll make an opportunity.
We take him if we get a shot.
How are you holding up?
Good.
Take a break.
I'll get us inside.
We'll end this thing.
Let's do it.
-Anybody got to use the bathroom?
-I do.
Me too.
Where is it, Maggie?
There's one across the street. . .
. . .but that's probably out
of the question.
You can use it if you
hold it till we get out.
There's one down the hall.
Thank you.
When she's gone, use this.
To contain the building,
I need teams on 19. . .
. . .20 and 21 .
And secure the lobby.
-What is Sabian doing?
-No idea.
Guy came in an hour ago.
They've been talking ever since.
Why is this taking so long?
They're trying to wear him down
so he gets tired.
Why do you have these cops
and their accounts in here?
Why are you investigating a fraud
you're part of?
I'm not part of any fraud.
Did you find these cops skimming
and blackmail them?
Is that how it works?
Why these cops?
They don't have access to the money.
It's basically insurance fraud.
What?
Some of these guys on this
list submit false claims.
Like an auto-body thing I pulled--
I mean, some guy I know. . . .
He'd tell the insurance company
his car had been wrecked.
It's very simple.
And then?
He'd never be paid if the
claims agent wasn't in on it.
So you need somebody to do
the paperwork, then cover it up.
Bingo.
That's where you come in.
lsn't it?
What is this, Sabian?
Who is this?
You're about to find out.
You talk to Linda?
I've done one better.
I found your informant.
You'll end up giving me
all my hostages.
Sergeant Cale Wangro.
He knows who's involved.
He was afraid
after Nathan was killed...
. . .and thought you may be involved.
Who was it?
This'll implicate too many people.
So the FBI will take his statement
to insure impartiality.
But this can't go over the air.
So it's over.
It's done. Come on out.
Get my wife.
Get his wife.
-They found the informant.
-Thank God!
Yes! Thank God!
Congratulations.
You're free to go.
Inspector. . .
. . .fuck you very much.
Thank you, thank you.
Let my people go, man!
Come on. Give it up.
Hold on.
At the academy, we worked
Area 6 together.
Chris, put Nate's informant on.
I don't want this broadcast.
lf he can clear me,
I want to talk to him!
This is Cale.
Hi, Cale. Brave of you
to come down.
I have a lot of questions.
Let's just start with
who was involved...
. . .in this conspiracy,
for 500.
I can't name names over the air.
Wouldn't be appropriate.
I don't want to hear that.
Who was involved?
Who was it?
Men you know, Danny.
Maybe others.
I only know the key players.
Don't make me say their names.
Why didn't you see Niebaum?
I didn 't know if Niebaum
was getting paid to be quiet.
I couldn't trust him
or Internal Affairs.
I did hear his name mentioned.
So Niebaum was involved.
Thanks.
How did you know Nate?
From the academy.
How long you been on the job?
Since '74. Why?
When did you last see Nate?
The night before he died.
Good.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Hold on, Cale.
Sorry.
Nate tells me you played ball
with him at Colorado State.
Yeah, but what's this got
to do with it?
He went to Arizona State.
Put Chris on.
Nice try, Sabian.
Your bluff didn 't work.
Niebaum told me. . .
...Nate was his informant.
He worked for IAD.
Worked for Niebaum all along.
He didn 't want me to know.
Niebaum says he was
not part of the murder.
What's going on here?
-He's using our bluff on Niebaum.
-He'll testify.
He'll name names. . .
...if you grant him immunity.
Call me back if we have a deal.
We've been made.
What are you doing?
I didn't make a deal.
They think you did.
But there is no ''they,'' right?
So you don't have to worry.
This was a bluff?
That depends on your position.
You knew about this?
No, I didn't.
I told him what I knew
about Nathan's informant.
This is how you
use the information?
Making us think he's innocent--
Who do you think you are?
I can use information
any way I want!
I don't know who's innocent!
I'm trying to find out!
Don't call me to be part of
your charades again.
Get him back!
Understand, I don't
know who to trust.
Up there or in there.
The bluff wasn't just for Danny.
Move, Rudy.
Move!
Who killed Nate?
They killed Nate.
Think they won't kill you?
Fuck it!
What are you doing?
Where are you taking me?
I know nothing!
They'll take me out
because you set me up!
You'll get another
innocent man killed!
Not that room!
Not that room!
Nate gave me taps.
I went to the guys
who were implicated.
They offered me money to lose
the evidence! I did it!
Okay? It was a one-time deal!
Nate turned them down,
they killed him.
Who's on the taps?
Get me out!
-Who's on the taps?
-All your friends!
Argento. . .
. . .Hellman, Allen.
That's bullshit!
I have proof!
I have the taps. . .
. . .saying they took money
from the fund.
Not by themselves!
Who's in charge?!
I don't know.
Are those taps on this computer?
Where are they?
I have them somewhere safe!
Air Tac- 1, civilian unit
approaching. Peel away.
You're flying in
crime scene airspace.
You must respect
the 2-mile boundary law.
Turn away from the building.
Who 's firing?
Who fired?
Initiate breach.
Do not breach!
Let me through!
Let me through!
Position's been compromised.
Unit 1 , status?
Kill the lights, Unit 1 !
Give me status.
We're coming in.
Fuck!
Move! Move!
He's got flashbangs!
Move!
Fuck!
Take him out!
Take the subject out!
Do not fire!
Do not! I did not give the order!
Do not!
Terminate breach!
Can you hear me?
Are you okay?
Shit. Shit!
They shot him.
Hold on, Inspector.
I'll get somebody to help you.
Danny, can you hear me?
Is anyone else hurt up there?
Come on, come on.
Is anyone hurt up there?
Come on. Hold on.
I'm going to get somebody.
Get somebody up here!
Niebaum's been--
Oh, God.
He's dead!
You hear that, Chris?
They killed him.
Are you shot?
Is anyone hurt up there?
Anyone else hurt up there?
I step out of this room
and someone gets killed?
It was an accident.
What did you expect my men to do?
A gun went off.
Who shot first?
What are you accusing us of?
My men responded to a situation!
lf a firecracker goes off,
you respond the same way?
What did we agree to?
No matter what, no one goes in
without my authority!
That's what we agreed on!
You got no eyes or ears,
only assumptions!
The breach was conducted
with my authority.
Not anymore.
We're taking over. FBI can't
let this situation continue.
Don't take me off.
Listen.
We're asking you to leave.
I bluffed him but he knows
what I was doing.
We need to rotate men--
He thinks someone
just tried to kill him!
We're going in.
Full breach.
Don't do it.
Listen.
You do, everyone's going to die.
Understand?
Maybe that's what some of you want.
I don't!
I was brought here to save
his life and bring him out!
Not jeopardize hostages.
Shut up!
This is a mistake.
You want to change
negotiators, fine.
But you give Roman 30 seconds
of opportunity, he'll exploit it.
Keep him locked down.
My men can handle it.
We've seen what they can handle.
Please.
Your men stay in.
Our men will support.
But you'll execute our orders.
You're off.
I'm surrounded by people who
want to go in and kill him.
You called him your friend!
I got nothing invested in this!
I wonder why that is!
Maybe someday we'll find out.
No more negotiating.
Please escort
Mr. Sabian to his car.
Lieutenant. . .
. . .this way, sir.
You call yourselves his friends!
Danny Roman,
this is Agent Grey, FBl.
Sabian's been relieved
and I'm in charge.
As of now,
all negotiations are suspended.
You have 5 minutes to surrender...
. . .or we're coming in.
Oh, Christ. Sabian's going in.
Danny, I'm on my way up.
It wasn't your fault.
We heard him confess.
He was guilty.
I know.
What's it matter?
Nate's dead. Niebaum's dead.
Computer's dead.
Sabian is coming upstairs.
Tell him what Niebaum said.
You going to give up now?
That'd be a crime.
Listen, all of you. . .
. . .I'm sorry about this.
This'll all be over soon.
Pick up the phone
or we'll be forced to come in.
Will you tell my wife
something for me?
Tell her I tried
to keep my promise.
Niebaum worked at home
as much as he worked here.
He could've kept
Nathan's taps there.
You alone?
Surrender. I can't hold them back.
They're coming.
I'm getting too close.
I know what went down now.
Hellman, Allen and Argento
are involved.
No proof.
Niebaum confessed.
We heard him.
They're shooting us one by one
and you're not helping.
Will you help us?
Who called for the breach?
Beck?
He says you fired first and
Niebaum was an accident.
He was assassinated!
He got three bullets, center mass!
Look.
Come on, you got to admit
something's going on.
Two cops are dead and you
killed one of them.
I need to get you and these hostages
out before they come in.
Let's end this!
They had to believe
I was capable of that!
There's only one dead cop,
killed by men who set me up!
I know Nate tapped
Hellman and the others.
Those taps
are at Niebaum's house.
lf I get there, I can end this!
You got no way out.
Surrender!
You gave me a way out when
you shut the heat off.
You know there's another
way you can help me.
You were wrong about me.
What if I'm right about them?
But what if you're wrong about me?
Uncuff yourself.
Get in the conference room.
Initiate full breach.
Shoot on sight.
Come on, Rudy.
Move, move!
Here, Maggie, use this.
Markus, split this between
you and Rudy. Wet it.
You know the drill.
A lot of gas and smoke.
Keys.
Don't be scared.
They'll save you in a minute.
Close the door.
Down, down, down.
On the ground.
Double up, now!
Found the hostages.
No sign of Roman.
Check the elevator shaft,
every vent and the basement.
Get up.
Let's go. Let's go!
We found Scott!
He's alive!
You want to prove your innocence,
here's your chance.
Make one wrong move. . .
. . .and I'll take you down myself.
Understand?
You want to get out of here?
Follow me.
lf he's in here, we'll find him.
He's not.
He's gone mobile.
This is Beck.
I'm now in charge of this operation.
-What are you doing?
-He left the building.
He's out of your jurisdiction.
Dispatch.
Suspect may have left the scene
on foot. Alert all units.
Copy. Alerting all units.
Sorry, Lieutenant.
Can we check the trunk?
I don't know what was going on.
A lot of shit happened.
You must have some idea.
I'd really like to help,
but my lips are sealed.
Frankly, I don't trust any of you.
I'm very disappointed
in all of you.
You got to help us out here.
I know what you're feeling.
You sympathize with Danny. . .
. . .but we need to stop him before he
does something dangerous.
You don't want
anyone else hurt, do you?
You don't tell us,
that's obstruction of justice.
You want to go to jail?
He went to Niebaum's house.
Why did he go there?
Why did he go there?
Nothing here.
Who did Nate see
the night before he was killed?
He went to see you,
but you weren't at the precinct.
You're running out of time.
Dispatch, this is Commander Beck.
I need an air unit deployed
to the 1 300 block of Addison.
Have HBT units meet me at
Addison and Iroquois.
I also need a supervisor to
clear the building.
Come on, there's nothing here.
It's over.
I'm taking you in.
You had your chance.
Don't screw me.
You said you'd give me time.
I know these bastards killed Nate.
Now, all I need is. . .
. . .two minutes and your radio.
I can make this work.
Come on!
Hold it, Hellman!
You come in,
I'll shoot you one by one!
Come on, it's all over!
You'll do a little time.
Karen'll be taken care of.
Nobody gets hurt.
All right? Come on.
Surrender.
Surrender, my ass!
I've got 2 disks with your voices
on them! Nate's taps!
Come on down the hall!
I got 1 5 shots here!
That's 5 apiece!
Whatever you're trying
to pull won't work.
Stop this and come out
before someone gets killed.
I know somebody else was in charge.
You couldn't pull this off!
You got this all wrong.
No, I got it right!
Is that why you're nervous?
You killed Niebaum and Nate?
That's absurd!
Come on. . .
. . .your guys will leave you hanging
for murder one and plea down!
Make a deal while you still can!
I swear, we don't know what
you're talking about.
Play dumb!
How could you let somebody tape you?
Listen to you!
Stop this shit and come out!
All right, keep talking, asshole.
You already did everything wrong!
You left me alive!
Me against you. . .
. . .and I won.
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck you!
I don't give a fuck what
kind of evidence you got!
Because you won't make it
out of here alive!
Stand down.
Put your weapons down
and get out of here now.
It's me, Frost!
I'm ordering them off!
I'm locking them out now!
It's just you and me, buddy.
You hear that?
They're gone!
Listen, Danny. . .
. . .I know you're scared.
You don't trust anyone.
A lot of shit went down.
I don't understand some of it myself.
Come on out.
You have my support.
Any evidence you have,
let's bring it out there.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
-Finishing what you started.
-What?
Roman is going out with me.
Alone.
We can't trust anyone else.
That's right.
We don't know who to trust.
Do you like westerns?
What's that supposed to mean?
I like westerns.
Can't get enough of them.
Watch them all the time.
My favorites are when
the hero dies at the end.
Remember Shane ?
What?
I think you're right.
Shane died at the end.
So you killed Nathan.
I killed Danny.
And now my hands
are as dirty as yours.
Only, I still have the evidence.
l'd say I'm in a very good
position to negotiate.
You want to deal?
You deal with me.
There's a time limit because
we're about to be interrupted.
Let's do this quickly.
I want in.
60 percent of everything
you've taken.
I can't give you
what I don't have.
You see, I spent a lot of my take.
I don't know how much Allen,
Hellman and Argento have.
We used a lot of it
to set Roman up.
50 percent of what you don't have.
30 percent.
45.
35.
You should've been a negotiator.
Right.
I want the evidence destroyed.
Deal.
This is everything?
What do you think?
Danny Roman's been shot.
He's dead.
Let's get you some help.
Come on. Here we go.
That's it. Come on.
We got an officer down in here!
You have the right to remain silent.
lf you give up that right. . .
. . .anything you say can and will
be used against you--
You won't get off that easy.
Some help here!
We got an injured cop here!
Give me your hand.
You know what I thought.
I'm sorry.
Sorry about that.
Nice bluff.
It worked.
I figured you'd rather
be shot by me.
Here's the one demand
I didn't meet yet.
Nice talking to you, Lieutenant.
Thanks.
Get him out of here.
Make sure this location
is secured!
I want this street cleared!
Ambulance coming through.
Move it!
