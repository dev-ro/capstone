Inflamed bronchi
with intra-parenchymal nodules...
...of which the origin must be collated
with the histological data.
Respiratory insufficiency is disabling...
Level 3 out of 5 for hypertension, tachycardia.
90 percent oximetry and dilation
of left ventricular.
So, Mrs Trappin...
Mrs Trappi... Mrs Trappu...
Mrs Trappo... Trappet!
Mrs Trappet.
What do these images conjure up for you?
It's bizarre, but I think it's pretty.
I don't know that "pretty" is a very apt word.
Yes, I was doubtful.
But the colours remind me of flowers...
A bouquet of worries.
That's getting closer.
What is this thing I have?
It's rare... but appearing
more and more frequently.
An auto-immune occupational illness.
Auto-immune?
Your antibodies are turning against you.
Why would they do that?
You said you were a hairdresser, didn't you?
The sprays that you use
have messed up your bronchial cells.
Your antibodies no longer recognise them.
My antibodies?
Antibodies are cells that perform
identity checks on the organism.
If a cell's identity is wrong,
it gets messed up.
"This must be a foreign body
mustn't it?"
Like the police demanding your ID.
"But we are bronchial cells!"
"You don't look like your photos.
Get out!"
This is what's making you suffer.
When the police are wrong, they do damage.
They take it out on themselves without knowing.
My antibodies are stupid.
No, my police metaphor wasn't meant innocently.
And the treatment...
Is it effective?
It depends what you expect of "effective".
Anti-inflammatory drugs can limit the damage.
They protect the cell from repression.
And...
And me... Me... I...
Do I have time with it?
It all depends what one means by "having time".
It's very personal.
Having time for you...
...is not the same thing
as for me.
I don't know what you do when you have time
It's difficult to give an objective
answer to a subjective question.
Bye bye, morons.
As a director of DESS North...
my DSI approach will be simple.
Reorganisation of the IT park...
...first and foremost
with my field... security.
But also development and strategy.
I created an algorithm
of ministerial interconnections...
...which links each individual
to all their national files.
I can present the parameters to the board
Attached is the technical file...
Mr Cuchas?
CCTV network...
We're ready.
Security level too low.
Too low?
Yes, I can see.
See it?
I can activate facial recognition.
Is that legal?
No, but feasible.
Karim Bella, born in Pontoise 23 - 06 - 87...
Karim Bella, born in Pontoise 23 - 06 - 87.
That's me!
Okay. Let's go back.
Attached are proposals for Legal.
Security? Lift network ready.
- You in the lift?
- Yes.
OK. It's left.
Who's left?
The lift's going up.
But I was stopped.
Your encryption algorithms aren't good.
Sir, I'm stopped.
The door's opening and closing.
Your codes are too fragile.
Hello?
Yes...
Yes, Mr Kurtzman...
Delighted to hear from you, Mr Kurtzman.
Immediately... I'm on my way.
See you, Mr. Kurtzman.
Hello, hello? Sir, excuse me...
Excuse me, Sir. Can you please
set me down?
Sir? Please.
Well, Mr Cuchor... Cuchas...
How's it going with the security network?
- Good. Very good.
- Good.
It's not very difficult...
basic home-automation.
I'm also well advanced on the
northern zone program.
Northern DESS...
It requires reorganising
the inter-ministerial connection.
I've created a powerful system
connecting everything to everything.
Legal advice finds weaknesses...
But I'll meet with a legislator...
Steady on, Mr Cuchus.
You see...
...the ministry wishes
that the Reorganisation of services...
...should be in the hands
of someone more...
How can I put it...?
More competent?
No. No, no... More...
- Younger?
- No.
Actually, yes.
On paper... the kids leaving
the major technical colleges...
'Centrale', 'Les Mines'...
Know what I mean?
But it will be up to you
to share with them... your ideas...
...for the reorganistion.
Much... much younger?
Young.
You told me that I'd be running the north zone.
Yes... But in fact...
No.
Between a very gifted old lion
and the arrival of new blood...
...the board has chosen the old lion
to train the young ones...
...so they can reorganise
the northern zone.
I've been working on it for 18 months.
I know... I know all that...
Besides... we're counting on you...
to... er...
...build up... integrate...
...initiate the way of doing things
in the minds of these young people...
...who perhaps later on will become
the new Mr Cuchos.
There's no point for you to move again.
Only the child can choose to find you.
I have a health problem
To find child given up for adoption
after 30 years, is very difficult.
And you're not even in the system...
You're not digitised.
I'm sorry.
Unless there are files existing
at the place of birth...
...there's no record
of your confinement.
What can I do?
"To give is to give...
to take back is stealing."
So nothing can be done?
We can submit a request to Internal Affairs.
- Internal Affairs...?
- Yes.
The upper echelon...
those who decide.
A unit of their service takes care
of the "given up for adoption" files.
I've tried to contact them several times.
They're in high demand.
Could take time.
I don't have much of that.
I'm sorry, Madam, but being in a hurry
doesn't help in these matters.
You are not alone.
I'm sorry...
Sorry, but I think this is very unfair.
I don't understand...
I apologize too... for the damage
I will cause...
...and for the work I shall be giving
to the maintenance staff.
The envelope on the desk is for them.
There's a bit of cash in it.
It's pointless to inform my wife
and my children.
I don't have any.
This retribution, out of anger,
may appear rather excessive...
But was just so terribly unfair.
I'm a good man...
I'm...
Excuse my rudeness...
Bye bye, morons!
What happened?
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Bye bye, morons!
Mr Cuchus... Cu... Cu... Mr Cuchos.
We need to talk about this.
Eh? No need for violence,
Mr Cuchor... Cuchor.
Put your gun down.
Let's talk about it...
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!
Mr Cuchor?
Have you put your gun away?
Don't shoot.
An executive from the health agency...
- Sawed-off shotgun...!
- Ballistic...!
A serious wound...!
Vital prognosis compromised...!
Armed and dangerous...!
Radicalised...!
Special Services...!
I had to call you, Minister.
Warn 'Interior'.
And this stays strictly between them
and us. Understood?
Hello.
Who are you?
Suze... Suze Trappet.
Hello.
How come I'm here?
Alors, je...
I was at the Health Department office...
...and I decided
to take you with me.
- To take me with you?
- Yes.
I'm looking for a dossier on a child
I gave up for adoption...
You should be able to help me.
- Help you?
- Yes.
You're an important guy in Internal Affaires.
And it's through you that...
I'm in 'IT Support'.
I've nothing to do with adoption files.
I'm sorry, Madam, but this is not right.
It's not how things are done.
You can't kidnap someone to get a dossier.
You can't shoot people at work.
What?
You shot at Mr Dupuis.
Oh no...!
I was shooting myself.
Everybody thinks you were shooting at him.
How is he?
So-so.
More dead or alive?
So-so.
So you have seen what happened?
- That depends.
- On what?
If you help me, I've seen everything...
Otherwise, I've seen nothing.
But... But you're sick!
That's right.
Anyway, I filmed myself with the computer.
They must have seen my installation.
What installation?
The computer... the gun...
You removed it all?
What right did you have to do that, Madame?
What did I ever do with you?
You didn't do anything!
Nothing at all!
I want someone to do something for me!
I've been asking for a lead for years...
...anything that would help me
find my kid!
Calm down.
Where did you have the baby?
There.
What do you mean?
It was the "cornflower maternity hospital".
Do you want me to do some digging?
They've told me that everything
will be found at the place of birth.
They mean the local birth
registry office... not here.
No... I know all that...
But I wanted to visit this spot again.
Would you come to the registry office with me?
After, I'll testify in your favour.
Please, Sir.
Madam,
One doesn't kidnap people...
I have to explain to my superiors.
They'll be happy.
Tell me what you've done with my computer.
Good luck.
Madam... please!
I'll tell them about you.
You'll be forced to tell the truth.
Hey, Mrs... Mrs Trappu... Trappi...
Mrs Trappo...
Are you listening to me?
Madam? Madam?
He gets a refusal.
And the other becomes the enemy...
no matter who that is.
The one who blocks his rise.
His ego dies, or survives.
If it survives, it is full of rage,
leading to his actions.
Terrible! Violent!
Did he have any differences with Mr Dupuis?
Mr Cuchar doesn't like the young.
I felt it during the interview.
Yeah...
A phobia about youth made him bitter...
He's no longer young, he hates himself.
He wants to kill him.
Nothing else?
At the cafeteria, Mr Dupuis
took the last available coffee.
That's it...
Mr Dupuis becomes a castrator,
the one that neuters Mr Cuchas.
And at this moment of rejection,
what does Cuchas hear behind the wall?
The voice of Mr Dupuis.
A young one!
But the gun?
The phallic expression
of a violated, repressed virility...
...which can only ejaculate
terrible anger.
Mais...
The two barely knew each other.
They know each other as "the other".
The other is everywhere in our lives.
You are my others.
I am your other.
The voice behind the wall is an 'other'.
And it's a familiar voice.
He's taken the last coffee.
In your working world,
it's a very important word.
Like in the desert.
He's taken the last glass of water.
He's taken the last camel.
Understand?
Can he offend again?
I wish I could say no.
But now he's on the run...
...full of rage,
and possibly re-armed.
And besides...
...there are plenty of "others".
Mr Cuchas!
At last!
Where are you?
Well, I don't know.
Come now, Mr Cuchas!
Temporal-spatial disorientation!
I assure you...
I was abducted.
Abducted!? Mr Cuchas...
Come now, Mr Cuchas...!
We're all one big family.
You've gone a bit far...
but it can all be sorted out.
Not at all.
I was the one it was meant for.
You know why, Mr Kurtzman.
Mr Cuchar, we need to see you
as soon as possible.
It will just be us...
No media has been contacted...
The Minister for the Interior
has given the instructions.
Interior? The police?
Am I wanted by the police?
The police have been made aware.
But it's kind of...
...kind of traditional.
Nothing more.
Softly... softly...
Don't over-dramatise it.
It's an informal first contact.
Create a link...
talk to each other, exchange...
It stays between us.
Between ministers.
I'm truly sorry... truly sorry...
These things happen...
Colleagues bicker sometimes.
How is Mr Dupuis?
He's a bit...
a bit shaken up.
But within a few years,
he'll be able to move his fingers.
I have a witness to what happened.
Perfect... Perfect...
So it can all be sorted.
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Excuse me, I'm looking for the archives office.
- Archives?
- Yes.
I know they're somewhere.
Hey, Pascal, excuse me, Pascal...
Do you know where the archives are?
How do you spell that?
Archives...
Archives...
I know they're somewhere... but...
Internal Affairs
Would you let the director
know I'm here, please?
Yes, right away,
Within hours, the police will be here.
If I find your dossier, will you help me?
I didn't know that Central Office
would send someone.
I hope everything is in order...
I'm sure that it is.
We don't visit the archives very much.
If there's any failure,
they would have reported it to you.
But I'm sure everything is in order.
This isn't a check-up.
I understand.
In your place, I'd say the same.
You're not in my place.
Yes, of course.
Excuse me.
124, we've passed it...
123...
121... 120! This is it.
I didn't tell you, our archivist is an OEH.
Obligation to Employ the Handicapped.
Our Mr Blin had an accident
under the Electricity Board.
Between administrations, we help each other.
All we could offer, was Archives.
What sort of accident?
Activists had made a coil to cut
electricity to police headquarters.
He'd been sent to supervise
the disconnection of the coil.
And the cops thought he was an activist.
No, I'm with EDF!
They flash-balled him.
He was the one who had the power cut.
- He moans.
- Is he blind?
Nobody comes to the archives.
You save on lighting.
But it's surely not a place
for a sightless person.
But no one ever comes here.
M... Z ...- In this case yes,
here we are.
The headers on the dossiers are
in Braille, as well as the keyboard.
He's doing very well.
He went from B1 to B3. So...
This way...
So, he was traumatized by the police.
He has a real phobia.
We should make him aware...
Mr Blin?
Z... F...
Mr Blin?
- Mr Blin?
- What's going on?
- It's me.
- Who?
Tuttle, the director.
- Who's with you?
- Don't worry...
- We've just come for a dossier.
- Really?
- That's what archives are for.
- Really?
Well, yes...
Hello.
My name's Suze.
Suze Trappet.
It's for a birth given up for adoption
May 16, 1989.
- Really?
- Yes, May 16, 1989.
Can you please look for it?
Most certainly!
- Thanks very much.
- I'll get onto it right away.
- Suze?
- Yes, Suze. Suze Trappet.
S... U...
He's a bit out of practice...
No one ever comes here.
- 'Suze' what?
- May I?
- Who are you?
- It's OK, I'm a friend, not the police.
- What are you doing with my computer?
- I'm using it.
5 percent of the budget on equipment
last year. It's a new model.
So with that amount, if it doesn't work,
the supplier will hear from me.
Mrs Trappet, I can count on you?
Yes.
Wow!
'Wow' what?
As I said...
5 percent of the budget!
Pretty cool gear, eh?
It's going to be difficult.
It'll be enough to look at the "T" s.
They're the "T" s.
All those "T" s have given up their child?!
Not all the "T" s have been digitised.
If you know what you're looking for...
Go ahead.
Let me know when you're done.
If you're still here in 6 months.
Mrs Trappet...j
I can put in a request to ACOP
and to CIRCO to do a search.
In a few months, we could have an answer.
I don't have that long.
Why now, after all these years?
That doesn't concern you.
More and more, it seems.
I could ask you why you wanted to kill yourself.
You acknowledge that it was
an accident with Mr Dupuis?
A few dozen files don't daunt me.
A few dozen...
Let's get to work! Come on!
Madam?
Serge. Serge Blin. Madam...
if I can help you...
Cuchas...
Jean-Baptiste.
Mrs Trappet is on my left.
Serge. Serge Blin...
if I can help you...
It's very kind of you,
but I don't see how... thank you.
No.
No.
No.
No.
No.
This is me...
There is an address for the care of the baby.
32 rue Floquet.
That was 28 years ago.
28 years!
Put down your gun and we'll talk.
I'm not armed.
Hands up.
I'm not armed.
It's a mistake.
Don't shoot.
- Your hands...
- I'm not armed.
Hands behind your head!
This is a mistake!
Stay still, madam.
Don't move...
they're capable of shooting.
Quiet!
You will laugh, but I was mad at myself.
It was a personal cock-up.
- Is that the police?
- Yes.
They're after Mr Cuchas.
- They're after everyone!
- Did the others leave?
Yes, stairs at the back.
- Stay calm.
- Mrs Trappet, Mrs Trappet...
Can I come with you please?
Rue Floquet...
It's an old street.,
The name had to change.
You won't have it on GPS.
But I'll help you.
There!
Lower your hands!
No... Go there... I'm ready.
Describe it to me and I'll help you.
A great straight main road,
a crossroads, traffic lights...
We're in town.
- Er... yes.
- You see?!
Rue Maurice Berteaux.
I haven't been here for ages.
I know it well.
After the traffic light on the right...
...there's a little grocer's shop...
run by Arabs in my childhood.
- Don't see it.
- Has it closed down?
Looks like it.
Well look on the left, a little square,
Jean Jayres Square...
...with bowls-players.
Is it still there?
No one playing bowls.
They'll be at Chez George's bistro, opposite.
Golden letters on red storefront.
A little old-fashioned...
...with small marble tables
on the footpath.
Yes, it's still there.
And just opposite, the Palace cinema,
3 screens, session at 10 a.m.
And further to the right...
...the old red-brick building
of the Music Conservatorium.
It's there... still there.
- What else?
- A small church.
Of course!
St Francis!
Small Gothic church of the 13th century...
...surrounded by a shaded plot
and the steeple raised to the sky.
That's it.
So... opposite St Francis,
Rue Floquet...
...goes off to the right.
Old houses on an avenue of plane trees.
- There, for once, that's it.
- "For once"?
Well... yes.
And here was me worried
that everything had changed.
He gave himself up with no problems.
No violence, no shooting.
Keep moving!
No handcuffs!
We're one big family.
32!
32?
- Someone's there!
- There's someone?
- There's someone?
- There's someone.
Hey...!
Excuse me...
It's a mistake...
It's not you.
What's not me?
Non...
You...
You are...
I'm...?
Your mother's son.
Well...
Well, yes... Yes I am.
Forgive me.
Thank you.
Mrs Trappet?
Mrs Trappet?
Oh, no!
Is someone there?
This is not right.
What's the matter?
The matter is that you're parked
in the middle of the street.
Can't you see that?
Well no, I can't.
You can drive in your condition?
What condition?
You don't realize, it is...
It's dangerous.
What will insurance say when I say
that a blind man backed into me?
I'm sorry, I'll have to call the police.
Oh no, no!
You have reached the police number.
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
He doesn't drive, either,
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
Sir?
Sir, get out of the car!
No, Sir, no!
Switch off the engine!
- A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
- Don't drive!
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
It was a suicide attempt.
I have a witness.
I never liked Mr Dupuis either.
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
Mr Blin?
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
You're not going to jail, Mr Blin.
No one's going to jail.
Not to jail.
- Mr Kurtzman?
- Eh?
I'll be back.
It's not a hit-and-run.
I'm going to find a witness.
Mr Cuchnas...
I'll be back.
I'll be back, I tell you!
Oh... Mr Cucha...
Mr Cuchta... Cuchas...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
After the baby, I was scared.
I wanted to be like everyone else.
Worst luck, I succeeded.
I succeeded so well, that I'm dying of it.
But I did search a lot.
Even when I was healthy.
Nothing. It all eluded me.
I even wanted to do it again...
and married... twice.
But again...? Impossible.
The sprays must have destroyed
my ovaries, before my bronchi.
But it could be... that he's happy.
Yes, why not?
It could very well be...
...he's loved, surrounded by...
He does wonderful things.
He's doesn't have to be some poor guy,
unhappy, lost, abandoned.
Maybe, he...
Tell me what I should do.
I'm an adult who does dumb stuff.
Please.
[Whispering to herself]
You OK?
Did they let you go?
Sort of.
You escaped?
It's only temporary.
Mr Blin smashed into us with your car.
- I said I'd come and get you.
- How's he doing?
A bit stunned.
On the other hand, your car...
No. 32 was no good?
No.
There wasn't much chance.
Mrs Trappet...
You said if I helped you, then you'd help me...
That you'd come and tell them
what really happened.
Here...
Your career awaits you.
I'll explain myself and take care
of your dossier. I promise.
Do me a favour... forget me.
You know...
Because people crack,
doesn't mean they're crazy.
I'm a normal sort of guy.
Quite sane.
A bit emotional, that's all.
You better hurry.
That's the fire brigade siren.
The police one is "too-hoo, too-hoo".
There was a number in your dossier.
I have the doctor you had at the birth.
It's Dr Lint, Jacques Lint.
Born May 26, 1943 in Limoges.
Studied from 1963 to 1970,
then practice in the suburb...
...where you saw him.
How do you know all this?
In the dossier...
with his registration number
So?
With a dossier number,
you have access to all its files.
What files?
Security files, census, traffic tickets, tax...
Everything in 3 or 4 clicks.
3 or 4 clicks?
Yes, I'm very good.
Here we are... Dr Lint has been
married twice, divorced once...
Curiously, for a ladies' man,
he chose gynaecology.
Why is that curious?
You'd think they'd find a woman disgusting.
Undertakers have lots of children.
Married twice, divorced once,
doesn't make for a 'ladies man'.
Whatever.
Dr Lint is at Ambroise Paré Hospital,
under the care of Prof. Graba.
Long-stay in Geriatrics, second floor.
Room 422 to be exact.
Well... he has really rejuvenated.
Maybe that's who
I clicked on. Dr Lint?
Excuse me...
who are you looking for?
Dr Lint, under Prof. Graba.
That's the 9th floor, staircase B.
Ask at reception.
Who takes care of the data updates?
That's not good at all.
Dr Lint?
Hello.
Hello...
Forgive me for disturbing you.
Suze. Suze Trappet.
30 years ago you attended
the birth of my baby. I was 15.
- Do you remember?
- No.
Sorry?
Ebixa... Chlorohydrate of memantine.
Treatment for pronounced Alzheimers.
That's not in his dossier.
You don't remember me, then?
All I remember is...
that I remember nothing.
15-year-old mothers weren't
very common at the time.
I was like this...
with dreadlocks...
...red tights, a nose ring.
Please...
Doctor...
Was I a doctor?
Yes, you were a doctor, who helped
bring babies into the world.
And I did something stupid?
Not at all...
You helped me give birth.
We had a baby together?
No...
We'll put it all back...
Excuse us.
What's this?
Well, yes... what is it?
Some sort of writing.
It's your handwriting?
Is this your handwriting?
Is that my handwriting?
Look at these numbers...
There...
I'll find a doctor.
To cure him?
No, to read it.
Looks like a doctor's handwriting, sure.
But what is it?
A sort of intimate diary?
That's quite possible,
an intimate diary. Yes.
And this would be numbers?
Numbers?
It's possible, yes.
Isn't that '1989'?
Yes, I recognise the 8, the... 9...
1989, yes, it's possible, subject to
the usual diagnosis, of course.
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.
Person to notify in an emergency:
His wife, Mrs Rose Lint.
I'll find the address.
Chips...
Look... "aspire" or "expire"...
you can't tell.
Mrs Rose Lint, 30 rue Charles in Meaux.
I can't bend my arm anymore.
What?
You're hurting me.
The guys from the police!
Don't hurt me!
I can't move it...
I can't bend it!
A handicapped doesn't go to jail.
Is it the police station?
You are at the hospital, not at the police.
Not the police?
So why are you hurting me?
You've been struck a blow.
I'm going to dress it.
I've been struck...
...I'm bleeding and
I'm not at the police?
That's odd, isn't it?
Isn't it, Superintendent?
- I'm not a superintendent.
- Oh, sure!
I'm a trap-shooting champion!
We can't leave him.
It's complicated enough already.
I gave someone up once.
Not twice.
Everybody is not your kid.
Get in the lift, quickly!
If you're not the police...
...why does it smell of horses
rather than ether?
Give him 3 stitches, I've had enough of him.
Why get upset if I rubbish the police,
if you're not from the police?
That's pretty weird, isn't it?
Mr Blin!
Mrs Trappet?
To your 12 o'clock... 5 steps.
1,2,3... blackout!
You stay there!
Mr Blin! 5 steps to your 11 o'clock!
12 o'clock 5...
12 o'clock 20...
12 o'clock 2020.
12 o'clock 25.6 o'clock...
Police! Open the door!
Police! Open up!
Open this door!
May I?
Er... snuff me out?
No, read your face.
Go ahead...
You don't look your age.
Thank you.
Shall we drop you off somewhere?
Sorry?
I'm here now.
No problem.
Mr Cuchas is helping me too.
It's nice of him.
I can describe the way to you,
so we get there earlier.
I have an address.
It may not be useful
to arrive as a group at Mrs Lint's.
We don't want to scare her.
We won't scare...
It's not a defeated face.
I don't know your age, but you'll make it.
What are you doing?
I'm looking for a wi-fi location.
Shall you spend your life tapping?
No wonder you are going wrong.
You know what they say...
"Tap less or be hapless."
By tapping, I found Dr Lint.
No, you found someone
who remembers nothing. Bravo!
Like all temperamental brunettes...
...she seeks life, energy,
enthusiasm, the positive.
She's looking for her kid.
As well, yes.
But it's still a quest for love.
Why do you say that?
I feel that this is a subject that
you're not on top of.
Go and take care of yourself.
Remember... I'm here now.
I'm taking care of it...
Goodbye.
Yes?
It's about a translation.
Oh... Jacques' handwriting!
It's always a mess.
I took months to realise the illegible
words he'd send me with flowers...
...said "I love you".
Just in time...
I was starting to lose patience.
Let's look at this notebook.
So...
16th of May...
16th of May... January...
April...
May...
So...
16th of May...
10am...
"Total failure... with...
"...my tomato plants."
- That's what it says there?
- Yes.
I was in the evening.
The birth was 9.39pm.
Alright.
Not here... 12.14pm...
Ah, here...
11.34pm.
So... 11.34pm.
"Birth... a young girl...
"15 years old...
"Boy...
"3.4 kilos..."
"The mother... has...
suffered a lot.
"Giving up for adoption...
"...asked for by the parents,
through Social Services."
"Out of the question!
"This kid... has a right...
"...to a chance.
"I shall undertake...
"to... suggest it... to...
"...to 'No Fallopian'.
"This misfortune
will make someone happy."
He wasn't given to Social Services!
He suggested someone else?
Yes... Yes, to...
to 'No Fallopian'.
Who's that?
Who is "No Fallopian"?
It refers to a patient
who didn't have fallopian tubes...
...who couldn't have a baby.
He used to refer to patients by such names.
He must have mentioned it...
it's not common, no fallopian.
- No Fallopian...
- Doesn't ring a bell?
He never talked about No Fallopian?
You'd remember.
- No Fallopian.
- I just don't know more than that.
Sorry...
It's a name that'd be hard to forget.
"Isabelle... something..."
"I have a meeting with No Fallopian"?
- "You know, No Fallopian who..."
- No, listen..
"No Fallopian called me."
I'm trying!
He must have seen her again for a follow-up.
Wait...
I'm trying my hardest, but...
Listen I'll look in his appointment books...
Sorry...
I'm sorry, I stained your carpet.
You really are seriously ill.
That's why you're looking for him.
What do the doctors say?
I'm a hairdresser...
I've breathed too much spray.
I'm dying from too much "permanent".
It's empty.
Is there a pharmacy near here?
There's one on the esplanade.
I'll leave you my card.
Alright.
Just give me the direction.
I'll hold you.
That's nice of you.
Heading 12 o'clock.
But I'd prefer Mr Cuchas helped me, too.
Cuchas... Except for an "I",
that made Cuchiasse. Get it?
- Yes, I do.
- Do what?
Get it.
- You match your name.
- That's possible.
30 Rue Charles, in Meaux.
Will you remember?
In town, coughing is normal.
It's the stuff we breathe.
We're breathing filth but we still breathe.
Do you have a handkerchief?
Here...
Thanks
Jacques...
I'm Jacques?
Yes, you're Jacques.
You sound as if you know me.
Oh yes, I know you.
Come in.
- It's your house?
- No...
...it's our house, Jacques.
Excuse me...
Can the taxi be paid for?
Can you pay for the taxi?
Cuddle?
Hello?
Yes.
Thank you.
Dr Lint called.
"No Fallopian" was a lady
named... Francine Weber.
And who has a son...
...named Adrien.
Adrien...
Weber, Adrien...
Adrien...
Like Serge, a lovely first name.
I have him.
On the other hand...
What?
"Update request".
Meaning?
I'm being tracked.
He is Adrien Jean Marie Weber.
Born May 16, 89, officially
son of Francine Weber, teacher...
...deceased 3 years ago, and Luc Weber,
researcher, also deceased.
They adopted him late in life.
A brilliant student, he got into Centrale.
He takes care of IT
at a big company, at 28 years old.
If that's the right place, he's not there.
I can hear tapping.
He's tapping in a funny way.
I feel as if I'm next to him.
We haven't got much time.
Are you ready.
- For what?
- To go and introduce yourself.
"Hello, I'm your mum."
"It's been a while
since we saw each other..."
"I'm here to tell you
I'm about to disappear?"
- "I just wanted to get a look at you."?
- Sure.
I mustn't touch him.
He has no need for me.
A brilliant lad, integrated...
He isn't some poor schmuck
that I feared he might be.
Integrated into a world
of crazies... Is that a success?
And you'd know, wouldn't you!
Precisely, I know what I'm talking about.
I'll stay back to watch.
Alright.
Just to see him...
Just to see him...
What's he doing here?
What do you mean?
Why is he here?
What do you mean?
Sorry, but I think he's not okay,
otherwise he wouldn't live here.
Why?
Mrs Trappet...
He's IT head for a major company...
Probably on 15 or 16,000 euro a month...
...and he's living in this box?
He doesn't waste his money
on some fancy apartment.
He's not doing well? No.
It's you who's not doing well.
Hey...
What are you doing?
There...
I will write your life In the ink of your eyes
Until the gray wins my hair
By that sleepless night you were my sun
Because your daily life is a boundless ocean
Silly poems...
He writes silly poems.
So what? It's...
As I said... he's not doing well...
he's in love.
Poor chap.
He's is not doing well because he's in love?
Absolutely.
- Is it bad to be in love?
- You don't understand.
For guys like...
For guys like him, love is terrible.
It's a total blockage,
something they'd never dare say.
They feel there always must
be a line drawn between people.
And if it's crossed, there's panic.
They become uneasy, they stammer...
Their hearts beat faster, their brows sweat
They feel bad...
close to fainting...
They want to...
And then they get stupid.
Did you see the poems?
Have you read them?
You're talking nonsense.
He's my kid.
I know what I'm talking about.
If he lives here, there's a reason.
He's hiding...
There's not even a name on the letter box.
But there's one on the
unsent envelope. Clara Sibiss.
Clara Sibiss lives 200 metres away.
You found that out?
If you were in love with a colleague...
...would you want to live near her?
Answer, damn it!
Sound of door locks!
- He's going out
- No, he's going to work.
- (At this hour?
- It's more relaxing than sleeping.)
He may have overtime to do.
What's he waiting for?
Maybe Clara Sibiss.
Scooter!
The scooter's passed.
Someone's going past.
How long can his silence last?
How long can his silence last?
Forever.
He has to talk to the girl.
But, if he knows her...
...maybe outside of the office.
Adrien and Clara work on
the 13th floor and all lifts...
...go to the 13th!
There... to the 13th
Wait...
The updates are not working.
The lifts are going up and down.
Lifts are supposed to go up and down.
There.
A violent stop.
All on the 13th.
I must find a way to evacuate the tower
and put the kids alone in an elevator.
I have the building lighting controls.
Know what that means?
What?
You'll see.
What is it?
The building's flashing!
Everyone does it at Christmas.
People aren't leaving the building.
They're enjoying the effects.
You're not making them move, by your tapping.
I have the fire security system.
That'll move them.
The fire security works really well.
It worked...
they're evacuating.
Good evening, Adrien...
What a story!
Sheer panic.
It's almost pretty.
Damp, but pretty.
I think it's stuck.
Maybe we should call someone.
Maybe call security.
Lift security?
Lift security?
Lift security?
Lift security?
Lift security?
Lift security. I hear you.
Good evening, we're stuck in...
lift 4...
north side...
You seem to have been stuck for a long time.
No, it's just...
Just a few minutes.
Er, no...
28 years in fact.
What?
There's nothing to fear.
We're not afraid.
No.
"I love you" are the most important
words to say in a lifetime.
You mustn't be afraid to say them.
Excuse me, but...
Just who are you?
I'm someone...
...who has loved you
since you were born...
...and who'll love you
until the day she dies.
Don't be afraid to tell that girl
that you care about her.
What girl?
The one in front of you...
Clara.
Don't be afraid to tell her
that you care for her...
...that you'll write her poems...
...that you'll send her flowers...
...that you live close by to her,
without telling her.
Needn't be afraid.
I love you, my beautiful boy...
and it makes me feel good to tell you.
What can you say to that?!
I don't know...
I don't understand
Is it true...
what that lady said?
No. Ah no.
That's to say...
No, I don't understand...
Adrien, I receive anonymous poems regularly.
They've even scared me a bit.
And I've seen you in my area.
Flowers, too...
Why haven't you said anything to me?
It wasn't me.
Yes, it's you.
That lady's right.
No need to be afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Could you free them, please?
Oh!
Did you hurt yourself?
No... it's the police.
Where are they?
Your 12 o'clock at 200 metres.
What are you doing?
Save yourself, Suze, I'll keep them busy.
I'm no longer afraid of them, Suze.
Off you go!
Buzz off! Split up!
A handicapped doesn't go to jail!
A handicapped doesn't go to jail!
Here I am!
Come and get me!
Police operation... Move on!
A handicapped doesn't go to jail!
Maybe, but we need to talk.
Take him away! Take him away!
Take him away!
Help!
Stand back!
We're taking him in.
They want to jail me!
Help!
Who was Adrien's father?
A jockey.
A jockey?
I found him mature, compared to
the teens I used to hang out with.
He'd cheated a little about his age.
A cradle-snatching jockey!
No, at 15 I could pass for 20...
He was 20, and could pass for 15.
We were very amourous.
They're searching.
And...?
When I fell pregnant, it was a disaster.
I didn't want an abortion.
My parents put me in a home for juveniles.
The judge put him in jail.
In jail?
Corruption of a minor.
And...?
E insulted the judge at trial and he escaped.
- He insulted the judge at the trial and then he escaped.
- Yes.
I understood why I was so in love.
But I never saw him again.
I was his worst memory, while he was my best.
They are very close.
Stop. Turn off the headlights.
Suze! Suze, they're here!
Get away! They're here!
Suze!
Suze!
I can't see, but I hear very well...
It's okay, I'm managing, guys.
Just relax, calm down.
I don't want to calm down.
Show yourselves!
We're expecting you, Mr Cuchas.
Don't you worry...
I'm the one they're after.
Put down your gun and come towards us.
Coming! Coming!
Nothing stupid!
Coming!
Stop stalling.
Walk towards us.
To start with...
It will suffice to press these 2 keys.
- Mr Cuchar, it's Kurtzman here.
- Hands on your head.
- And I'd like to tell you...
- I'm here. It'll all be fixed.
- Mrs Trappet...
- Come on.
- Don't make us come to you.
- Suze...
Nothing will happen to you.
We shan't hurt you.
I'm not afraid...
to say I care about you.
Put down your gun and walk towards us.
And anyway...
...it makes me feel good.
Drop that gun!
Drop that gun!
Drop the gun.
Lie down!
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!
Don't move!
Stop there!
Hands on your head!
Don't move!
On the ground!
Drop the gun!
Cut the crap!
- Isn't it Mr Cuchas?
- It's not Cuchar, no.
Down! Hands on your head!
Last warning!
Down!
Drop the gun, damn it!
Stop where you are!
Lower the gun!
Don't move!
- That him?
- Yes, it's him. It's Cuchlar.
Can I come with you?
Are you sure?
Let her go! Get away from her!
Lie on the ground!
By bye, morons.
