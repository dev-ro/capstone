Hey, so...
Today is Saturday,
February 23rd, 2013.
And I wanted to share this crazy
story that happened to me
a couple of days ago.
My name is Samantha Futerman.
I was born in Busan, Korea,
on November 19th, 1987.
{\an8}And four months later,
I arrived at JFK Airport,
{\an8}where, apparently,
all babies don't come from.
We had Matt 
and then we had Andrew,
and I said, "Okay,
we're gonna adopt a girl."
Two years later,
we went to Kennedy Airport,
and I didn't get the one
with the spiky hair.
Didn't get the one
with the spiky hair.
I got the littlest,
and she was bald,
but she was very cute.
And, yeah, I met my family
for the first time,
my mom, my dad 
and my brothers.
And from that day on,
these people were my family.
Not by blood, obviously.
I mean, I look, literally,
nothing like them.
But I found my way
and made my place known.
You had the
nightly Titanic sinkings.
You used to play the music,
and stand on your bed and throw
your dolls on the floor,
'cause that was the water
and they were all drowning.
I started performing
as a kid in my hometown,
Verona, New Jersey.
And then, eventually, 
after college,
I moved to L.A.
to do the whole actor thing.
I went to your okiya weeks ago.
They laughed and turned me away.
Please, I did not know.
I've missed you so much!
-You know this guy?
-Because I'm Asian?
We don't all know each other,
you racist mother--
Wait, I do know this guy.
And somehow,
I ended up doing this 
crazy, fun YouTube video,
with my friend Kevjumba.
If you think your junk's
gonna get all up in this,
you're very,
very, very wrong.
I was just wondering
if you want...
So, please, back off or I...
Fuck it, I'm gonna
punch your dick, okay?
-Done.
-My dick!
We knew you were dramatic.
You were such
a sweet little girl.
So, basically on Thursday,
February 21st, 2013,
it was the premier
of 21 & OVER.
And I had made plans to go
to my friend Lauren's house
to get my nails painted. See?
I look on my phone and there's
this message from Twitter.
It says...
Hey Sam, my friend Anais
sent you a message on Facebook.
Check it, it might be
in your spam folder.
I went on Facebook,
and I was like, "Okay, weird."
And I didn't see any messages,
so I clicked into the friend
request.
"Oh, that's... Wait, that's me.
That's a picture of me.
Okay, this is strange."
So, I accepted her friend
request.
"Hey, My name is Anais.
I am French 
and live in London.
About two months ago, 
my friend was watching
one of your videos
with Kevjumba on YouTube,
and he saw you
and thought we looked really
similar, like, very
really similar...
Today, he saw the trailer 
of 21 & Over and told me
he saw you again.
I then checked 
your name on the cast,
stalked you a bit,
and found out you were born
on the 19th of November, 1987.
I checked more of your videos,
which are hilarious,
and then came upon 
the How it feels to be
adopted video
and discovered you were
adopted too."
She's also adopted and
was born on November 19th
in South Korea.
"So, I don't want to be
too Lindsay Lohan, 
but... How to put it?
I was wondering, where were
you born?"
She was born in Busan, but her
birth certificate says Seoul.
Which is exactly
what happened to me.
"Let me know.
Don't freak out.
Lots of love, Anais."
I was at home.
I got a text message 
from Sam saying,
"A girl just messaged me
on Facebook and she
looks just like me."
At first, I didn't really
think anything of it,
I was kind of like,
"That's weird."
And then, 
she sent me a picture.
I was like, "Oh, my God."
Then, she sent me, like,
"WTF" or something like that.
Then I asked her,
"Is she adopted too?"
And she said, "Yes."
And now, it's like,
some pieces started forming.
Oh, my God.
And I wrote her,
"Are you okay?"
Yeah, dude, I, like,
might have a twin sister,
who grew up in France
and now lives in London.
That's pretty fucking crazy.
So, I just got home
from an audition and I am
about to go online
to Facebook and then Skype,
and skype
my potential twin sister,
which is really crazy.
{\an8}Are you there? Wanna skype?
Okay, here we go.
Oh, my God. Wait.
I'm sorry,
my connection is really bad.
Oh, my God, you're European!
Hi.
Hello.
This is a really
weird experience.
Yeah, so weird.
I don't know 
where to look.
Wait, what did you say?
I don't which 
little window to look at.
I know, right?
Oh, my God, this is so weird.
We're like The Parent Trap.
It's really crazy. Yeah,
it's so funny that my 
friend was watching
the videos of your friend
Kevjumba and he just
stopped on that...
On the video where we see you
punch him in the dick.
He just took a screen-shot
and sent it to my Facebook,
and everybody was liking it.
But people 
were asking me, like,
"What was the video
you did on Youtube?"
I'm like, "That's not me."
"What do you mean?"
I was like, 
"No, it's not me."
And then, it was...
I was getting really anxious
not to be able to talk to you
or, like, to contact you.
So my friends were like,
"We can send her Instagram."
And so, we were trying
different ways of
attracting your attention.
I called my dad.
It was his birthday 
on Thursday.
And I called him, I was like,
"Happy birthday!"
And I was like,
"Are you sitting down?"
And he was like, 
"Yeah, I'm sitting.
Why? What's up?"
And I was like, 
"Dad, I'm a twin!"
And he was like, "What are you
talking about? You're crazy."
'Cause I'm stupid. Like,
I would do stuff like that,
like, all the time.
My mom thought it was weird
that I was calling that many
times, like 10 times.
And she was like,
"What, what do you mean?
Do you think 
she can be your twin?"
I'm like, "I think so."
I really want to meet you. 
I wanna meet you, like, now.
Same, 
I really want to meet you.
Just want to hang out
somewhere...
I know, right? 'Cause you're,
like, right there, 
but you're not.
'Cause you're in London.
Oh, my God, I don't wanna go,
but I feel like I have...
I really need to go to
the loo. But I've been...
I drank so much tea.
And I really need to go,
but like... 
I'm like, 
"No, I don't wanna go."
Oh, my God.
I have a twin.
A twin.
I'm super excited. 
I mean, I'm a little
nervous, to be honest.
I don't know why. I mean...
I guess I know why.
'Cause it's, like, a crazy
fucking thing that happened.
Seriously, how weird 
would it be, though, 
if you weren't twins?
 If we weren't twins, it'd be really weird.
  It'd be like...
I mean, I think we're twins,
like...
So you don't have
a doubt in your mind?
I don't have
a doubt in my mind.
But, then, all these little
things put that,
like, ounce of doubt, you know.
Hang on, I'll turn it around.
I tell you,
that's crazy.
That is so... That's crazy.
Isn't that weird?
Blows my mind.
Hi.
How are you?
God, you look so similar.
Same freckles.
Yeah, she has 
freckles as well.
-That's Pierre.
-Hi.
-And Camille.
-Hello, Sam.
-And Valentin.
-Hi.
-And Marie and Jase and Jay.
-Hi.
Hey, Sam.
It's not Sam.
You guys are already annoying.
I got in contact with
the adoption agency, Holt?
And the last email says,
"Hi, Anais, I have been
examining your records.
"No elements is referring
to a twin sister.
"And looking at the birth
dates, we can see that 
they are the same,
"and the same city
and a lot of similarities.
"So, it's true that we can
ask ourselves 'Why?'
"I can help you 
in your research for 
your biological parents.
"We have to contact
the government agencies
"and that could take some time.
"Do you want to start
the research or not?"
They emailed me something
similar the other day
'cause I have to give
more information.
Can I send the pictures
that you sent me of your
record to him?
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.
Yeah, because when you went
to Korea last year, you
went to SWS?
Yeah, we went to SWS.
That's how I saw my records,
'cause I only have
the pictures of them.
SWS has my records.
Oh, really? So they're not
even giving it to you,
it's quite strange.
Yeah, it's weird.
Hmm.
Okay, Samantha.
This is my Twins Study Center
library.
I've written all these papers
about twins.
{\an8}Twin relationships,
twins personality, 
intelligence.
And I'm very proud to say
that I have the entire
Bobbsey Twins collection.
Oh, my God.
That's awesome.
And this is the whole twin
experience.
Makes me wonder how many
other pairs are out there.
You would never have found Anais
if it hadn't been
for the Internet.
-It's amazing.
-Right.
If you turn out to be twins,
there's gonna be a meeting time.
It's gonna profoundly
change your life.
In the event that
you're not twins,
it'll probably be a
disappointment and a let down
for the two of you,
and then, you'll have to decide
the extent to which
you want to continue
having a relationship.
So, I think you just have
to be prepared for that.
Now, just imagine
both scenarios
in your head
and be prepared
for whatever
comes and just...
Don't let yourself be
disappointed if things
don't work out.
And if things work out,
just celebrate it to the hilt.
Thank you, really.
My pleasure.
I don't know. I guess
I'm nervous. I don't want
to mess it up.
I don't want to... It said,
"Don't touch inside the card."
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, did I do that?"
"What if we're not twins?"
I mean, I don't think it's
possible that we're not
twins.
It's just kind of weird.
Okay, anyway,
I'm hungry.
Let's have dinner.
Let's do the thingee.
Maybe we can eat in front of...
What's that?
It's the DNA test, dummy.
Yeah, let's have  a quick dinner.
 You guys can stay with us.
You'll watch us.
Or you can just do your
own things if you want to.
Funny.
And then we'll do
the test.
I want dinner.
They're so French.
Did you ever see the Instagram
I sent you that for, like,
when we were
trying to reach you?
No? You didn't?
You never saw that?
No, I never saw that.
Can you read it?
Yes, says, "Hey, Sam,
check your Facebook message.
-"Spam box."
-Yes.
It was an Instagram.
No, I never saw that.
It was eight weeks ago.
Because we thought that
if we were just sending you
tweets,
you might think it's a spam.
So, Luke had the good idea
saying, "If I write,
like, a message,
"it would look real."
Very nice handwriting.
I love you!
Should you leave
your computer to rest?
She goes brush her teeth
and we do the DNA test?
Oh, my God, you look
exactly the same.
Yours is gonna have
red wine on it.
No, she brushed her teeth.
I think you go like this.
It seems like 
it's this big moment of my life
that I'm taking a DNA test,
but it's not, really.
It's just, like, Wednesday.
You know? It's just Wednesday.
And I just swabbed my cheek,
and now I'm sending it to Todd
to see if I have a DNA match
with a person who lives
across the world
and grew up 25 years in France.
Goodbye, fish.
Bye, fish.
Apparently, 
I had a dream that we went 
to meet Anais.
{\an8}We got to the house
and there were these, like,
{\an8}dinosaur exhibits,
like at the museum there.
{\an8}Marie was cooking pasta, 
but she didn't cook it 
in boiling water,
{\an8}she cooked it in room
temperature water,
garlic and parsley and stuff.
{\an8}It tasted good, and then Anais
came out and she was wearing
{\an8}these, like, peach pants.
And I was, like, waiting 
for a hug and she didn't
give it to me.
Then we were walking down 
the street and she was like,
"No, come here.
I gotta tell you something."
And as she was walking 
she looked less and less
like me
and she had, like, curly hair
and her face didn't 
look like mine anymore.
And then, I woke up.
So is Anais 
still your twin?
In the dream,
I don't think that she was.
Sad.
It says, "Hi Samantha, I hope
this email finds you well.
"When you have a moment,
will you give me a call?
{\an8}"Or, let me know when it'll be
a good time to schedule a call."
Hi, Ben, it's Sam. How are you?
{\an8}Oh, hi. I'm doing well, 
how are you?
{\an8}I'm good.
So, I got an email from
the post-adoption worker
who's been working
on your case.
We have a bit of an update
for you guys.
They did contact 
your birth mother.
She's denying that 
she had children
and they pressed her 
a little further on that 
about the twin issue,
and, of course,
she denied that as well.
So, it sounded like
she's not really in a place
where she's able to kind of
reconcile these things.
Right.
They tried to go to the birth
clinic where you were born,
but it was closed 
a long time ago.
And the doctor
has already passed away.
So, I don't know if you guys
are making any progress
on the DNA test?
Yeah, we actually just sen
it to the lab already.
Okay.
Yeah, it's...
Even though there's 
so little information,
it kind of fills in
a bit of that gap.
But, at the same time, 
your birth mother had
difficult circumstances
and very little support,
from her immediate community,
whether it's, you know,
her social circle 
or her family.
You know, one thing you can do
is write a letter.
We can send it to them. 
You can send along 
some pictures and things.
And a very non-threatening way
of putting yourself out there,
and they can keep that 
in your file
and let her know that she can 
access that if she wants to.
Okay, definitely.
Thank you so much.
Okay, yeah. Thanks, Sam.
Take care.
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.
So crazy.
It's Anais.
Hi, Snail.
I have to go to work,
like, a minute ago,
but I had to tell...
So, the adoption agency
called me today,
and he said that they tried to 
reach out to our birth mother,
but she says... She just
denies that she had
babies and gave them up.
Oh, okay.
But yeah...
But he called me today
and kind of told me that.
-Which is okay, but...
-Okay.
Yeah, I wanted to tell you.
Yeah, no, for sure.
It's quite...
I feel sorry for her now.
Like...
Yeah.
And that's all they know, 
like, about her life 
and everything?
Yeah.
That's what I said too.
I feel bad that she has to,
like, hide it.
It's just that 
I wanna get it over with.
No, it's okay.
It's totally cool.
You don't have to look 
so relieved.
No, but, seriously...
It's just crazy, you know,
like, how things happen.
In life, you think...
You know, my mom is
really big into saying,
"When God closes a door,
he opens a window."
Right now, it's pretty true,
you know?
For some reason, I didn't get
certain acting jobs and it led
me to this one.
So, I better get back 
to work then.
Yeah.
Then I found her and...
Like, now is the time
that I'm supposed to...
supposed to have her,
yeah, it's...
-Oh, cool.
-Yeah.
I can't wait until you're here
and I can tell you, 
"Come here."
I miss you. It's funny.
I'm excited.
Anais.
I have to pee.
It's crazy, 
how you can, like,
unconditionally love someone
you've never met.
'Cause that's how I feel.
But I don't love
my brothers any less.
You know? I don't love
my parents any less.
But there's definitely, like,
an unexplainable connection
that I have with her.
It's pretty cool.
I guess that's why
I'm going to meet her now.
And also, I can't wait 
to go to Europe
and drink a lot of beer.
And eat fish and chips, 
and meat pies.
London.
Are you excited? You're gonna
have two older brothers now.
It's so cool. I always wanted
somebody to hit.
'Cause I was... I'm always
hitting my friends and
they're like fed up.
What's up?
I'm really nervous.
Do you like cooked
carrots? I hate cooked
carrots. It's like...
I don't like cooked carrot
either. Do you like salami?
Yeah.
It's my favorite.
You're in a long distance
relationship, right,
-and you Skype someone.
-Yeah.
But then when you see them
in person for the first time,
like, for a time, it's weird.
Yeah, it's still kind of weird.
And I've never even met her,
so it's gonna be weirder.
This is crazy!
It's so funny 
that picture from 
the festival in your jeans,
I was wearing the same jeans.
So weird.
Same nostrils.
You think we're 
identical twins?
Yeah.
Don't look upset about it.
Did you buy some alcohol
to drink?
I have 345 pounds to last me
ten days in London.
You think I can do it?
We're at the airport
right now,
at the terminal,
and we're going
to get on to our plane.
There's Ryan. There's Lisa.
I can't ever complain
about anything again,
'cause I'm the luckiest person
in the whole world,
for all this shit to be
happening, you know?
You can't just give up,
if hard shit happens to you,
and, like,
crazy things happen,
you just keep going
and see where it takes you.
I don't know. Yeah.
Good morning, 
ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to
London's Heathrow Airport.
The local time here in London
is nine minutes past
eleven in the morning.
You ready?
I'll never be ready for this.
I don't know.
Hi, James, I didn't know
you were here already.
-No one's here yet.
-Okay.
Oh, wait, I got to get my stuff.
Thanks, Airbnb.
Whoa!
This is so cool.
Oh, hey, elephant.
This is so cool.
Oh, man, mine.
Yes.
This is awesome.
Anais will be here
in about 45 minutes or so.
She's picking up her parents
at the train station
and they have to stop by
at her parents' hotel first.
And then, it's just her
and her mom coming here.
And Marie and Lucas
should be on their way now.
Am I gonna to meet them
before I meet Anais?
Oh, you guys came
straight from the bar.
Oh, my gosh.
You made it in good time.
-Oh, my God.
-Hello.
{\an8}-How are you?
-Good, how are you?
{\an8}-Good.
-Good to meet you.
Is it weird?
-To see you?
-Yeah.
Yeah, really weird.
Two fountains over there.
I can't wait till...
Should I hide somewhere?
Getting freaked out,
everyone.
- They're here.
- Oh, shit.
They're here.
Sounds good.
I don't know where to go.
I feel like I can't get up.
Okay. You sit there.
There's no one downstairs.
-What?
-There's no one downstairs.
You're kidding.
Are they at the right address?
You guys, I feel like my heart's
racing and I have to poop.
Sorry.
Oh, God.
They're not here together.
You guys are silly.
Coolest dude...
Oh, my God. Hi!
Hi.
I saw you on Instagram.
Hi.
It's so strange.
And she took care of it.
-Hello.
-Hi.
I'm sorry.
-Hi.
-Hi.
How funny.
Oh, my God!
I feel weird.
You're cheating.
In those heels, you look taller.
Okay, that's better.
Oh, my gosh.
Two daughters now.
Yeah.
-Hello.
-This is so French.
I feel like I'm at the zoo.
Like I'm an animal in the zoo.
Yeah.
We have the same nails.
Yeah, we saw that today.
And we have the same pants
and stuff.
I feel weird.
You're taller.
I told you.
Not really.
Back to back.
First contact, finally.
Kiss.
It was so weird
'cause everyone was there.
I know, and you're like...
-It's like,
"Stop looking at us."
-Yeah.
It can be
the right and the...
- My left hand.
- Yeah.
She looks so familiar
to me, you know.
I'm really tired
and overwhelmed,
but I'm good.
Are you tired?
Can you guys tell who we are?
Ryan just thought
you were Sam.
Yeah.
It freaked me out.
It's nice.
Which one's the Korean one?
I was really dramatic
when I was a kid.
And I loved doing plays
at school and theater,
and I was always wearing
costumes as well.
I was really... I don't know
the word in English...
I was really moody and,
I had, like, anger management
issues.
I was a hot-tempered kid.
Sometimes, when I was a kid,
I felt lonely,
but I couldn't explain why.
I don't have any 
brothers or sisters.
So, I actually don't know 
how it feels
to have someone in your family
about the same age.
I could not describe it.
I would tell my mom,
"I'm bored."
I'm like, "I don't know
why I'm bored."
And then she would meet
one of my friends in the street
and she would say,
"Do you want to come up
and play a little bit
with Anais?"
And they would come, I would be
like, "I don't want to play.
"I don't want to see anyone.
"I just feel lonely, but I don't
want to play with anyone.
"It's not going to
help me feel better."
So, I can't explain 
that feeling. Maybe 
it was just missing Sam.
It's sudden if you imagine 
you are drawing a path,
and different options 
in your life.
You know, like, "In 50 years,
I see myself here and here,
or maybe here and here."
But Sam, it's like diving 
into a wormhole,
and going to a parallel space.
It has nothing to do
with anything you could
have ever imagined.
So different.
-Is it working?
-Yeah.
It's working.
Okay, excellent, excellent.
-Hello.
-Okay.
So I can try to see
if I can figure out
who's on the left
and who's on the right.
-You think that last
one percent confirmation...
-Yeah.
But it makes all the difference
in the world.
It's the only, like, concrete
thing that they have.
I think that's Samantha 
on the right.
Yes, you're pointing to Sam.
Sam is pointing to Anais? Wow.
You fooled me, 
and I'm pretty good.
So, all right, are you ready
for this information?
Yeah.
Okay.
So, I want you to look 
at each other,
and I want you to give your
identical twin sister
a hug and a kiss.
-I feel like we knew that.
-Yeah.
-Did you hear it?
-No.
You guys, we're not
related at all.
-Knew it.
-Really?
No.
We're identical twins.
- Identical twins?
- Identical?
These girls are 
identical twins,
there's no question about it.
DNA does not lie.
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
Yes, my dear?
We have news.
What do you think?
Well, yes, obviously,
I think it is yes!
Yes, we are identical twins.
You are identical twins?
Congratulations. 
When I saw you today, 
there was no doubt at all.
Wonderful.
{\an8}Oh, how wonderful.
I'm so happy for both of you
and for me too.
Oh, that's great.
I'm not crying.
Oh, Grandma.
Oh, God, that's wonderful.
Now, how can I go 
into a meeting tonight 
with red eyes from crying?
{\an8}You're sisters, aren't you?
{\an8}Yeah.
Holy shit.
Oh, my God.
So, this is your place?
Yeah, this is it.
Nice.
This is really weird. Like,
I feel like I'm dressing myself.
You want to meet my sister?
Hey, you want to meet my sister?
God!
No!
-Say something.
-Jay.
No.
That's the American version
of "Jay." So happy for you two.
That's insane.
Oh, my God.
I tried to do it and I
dropped it after five seconds
'cause I couldn't.
But I French seamed it,
so I can't...
No, it's not going to...
It shouldn't stretch.
I can just fold it,
'cause this thing folds.
-And then, you can just have it.
-Yeah.
Dude, my twin is awesome.
She's so cool.
You guys are so talented,
it's really freaking crazy.
These are like
the best students at, like,
the best fashion school.
It's really awesome.
{\an8}Do you need any extra
wadding in the shoulders
on the gray one?
How did it go?
Dragmar and Valeria,
F. Juan Manuela tiara.
It's almost over.
Too many models
and garments to organize.
You have to run everywhere,
make sure nobody loses anything.
Sam was being really helpful.
She helped me with the shoes,
and for the fitting and
everything.
It's nice.
Anais Bordier.
It was so good.
Anais was amazing
I feel so proud.
Congratulations. 
You definitely need a cocktail.
It was so cool, really.
My parents 
and my brother get in today,
and my other brother Andrew
gets in tomorrow. So stoked.
It's awesome.
The next station is 
King's Cross St. Pancras.
Yeah, where's Sam?
Sam, are you peeing?
-Your parents are here.
-Really?
-Did you see them?
-No, they just got out 
of the taxi.
-Did you run away?
-Yes.
Just be like, "Hi, Dad."
And pat his belly.
Who's this?
-Hi, Dad.
-That is Anais.
Oh, my God.
That is Anais.
My God, do you guys
look identical.
-It's crazy, right?
-This is Samantha.
- Hi.
-  -Hello, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I can't believe it.
She's taller.
Great, thanks, Dad.
She's got expressions 
that Sam does.
And they're both gorgeous.
And I really feel like
I know her.
Looking at her
facial expressions,
and the little body movements
that are also yours,
it's like I know who she is.
I want to spoil her.
I want to take her now
and spoil her.
Our families are together,
it's so weird.
Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.
Good morning.
-How's my sweetie pie?
-Hey, Dad.
Very European, Dad.
I never thought of Sam
as an adopted sister,
it was just a sister.
So, now, same thing with Anais,
it's like, she's just a sister.
It's not like another adopted
sister or somebody else's
adopted sister.
It just, she's another
part of the family. 
Same as you.
It goes back 
to that whole
"Nature vs Nurture" thing.
And the fact that two people
raised completely separately,
in, you know, very different
situations are so similar,
and are, you know,
almost the same person.
Sam is one of
the most important people,
if not the most important
person, in my life.
So, now with Anais, you know,
even someone not, you know,
growing up in our dynamic
just fits right in perfectly.
She's my new sister.
It's awesome, you know,
I love it.
Wait, do you feel this? Do you
feel this? Do you feel it?
She's like a...
She's my favorite sister.
It's...Yes.
I have an American flag
vest too.
Hanging out 
with Anais for the first time, 
I found out that
she felt that she didn't
choose to be adopted.
She was kind of thrown into it.
For her, it was kind of
traumatic and, you know,
on the playground,
a boy was like, "You don't look
like your family,"
and like, "You were given up
because your family
didn't love you."
And she questioned
whether that was true or not.
I never felt that
in my life, I didn't...
I didn't know that was a thing.
I didn't know that was an issue.
My family's white, 
my town is white.
But it was never an issue
'cause everyone 
was really accepting.
But for Anais, 
being adopted was
kind of a bad thing.
'Cause like, "Well, 
one person didn't love me
"and my parents 
couldn't have kids,
so they had to get me.
"What if they could have kids?
What if they wouldn't 
have had me?"
And Anais's father
was there...
Cheers to my
grandparents and my parents
for giving me those big tins
of duck and I keep them
all the time.
Cheers.
I didn't know because he
could've just sounded like,
"Oh, my God, you know what?
What a coincidence."
I think his first reaction is,
"I watch too much of Youtube."
Clearly. I agree.
But I do, I do watch 
a lot of videos,
and somehow just landed up
on Kevjumba's video.
And I don't even know
why I was watching that.
'Cause I've never ever
heard of this guy before.
No way.
That was the first time I...
Literally, the first time I saw
it was the first time I took the
screen shot,
so I saw it and I saw Sam,
I was like...
And I paused the video
and I was like, "Okay,
this is a bit bizarre."
I put it on Facebook.
And I think it wasn't just me,
it was Marie, Jase, Max.
It was all of us
just freaked out.
It was like, "You're joking.
This is not possible."
"Oh, my God, this is Anais,"
and then we looked
for the video,
and the video is
about a high school girl.
So, my first reaction was, "Oh,
she's probably much younger,"
and we just stopped at that,
or I just stopped at that.
I was like, "She's probably
younger. She looks the same
but she's probably 18."
For me, it was impossible
that she could be my twin.
Because I knew that I do not
have a twin. Because it was
written all over my papers
that I was an only child.
So I knew she wasn't my twin.
So, if she wasn't my twin,
she had to be a half-sibling,
or another sibling.
And then I didn't want to know,
because, yeah,
I didn't want to look at it,
and not get too excited
about something like this.
I think it's funny
now it's you
'cause, like, I never realized
this at first, but, like,
being adopted is
different for us 'cause I grew
up with brothers and you didn't.
And so it was like
that feeling...
Like, I never had that feeling
of being lonely,
and you had such a different
experience of being adopted.
And, like, contacting family was
such a different experience for
us both,
'cause it's like you didn't have
the brothers and sisters
and I didn't know that, yeah.
I always felt 
like I was waiting for 
something to happen.
And I was scared
that nothing would happen
in my life in a way.
I was like...
I always needed
to look for something,
like, dream, like,
dream of something,
I don't know.
Waiting for something
to happen, anything.
But now it feels better.
It feels like
it's more comforting.
When we're running 
around together,
I feel completely fearless.
And I guess,
I'm scared of losing that.
Hey. That was good timing.
It's just really 
weird settling back 
into life now.
I have a sister
and I really miss her,
and I really want her to come
visit and I can't wait for her,
to, you know, get a job and...
I wish so bad 
that she could get a visa,
and come and work
in the States.
That was the craziest trip
I'll probably ever go on
in my entire life.
Now it's over
and now it's going from here.
The situation's crazy,
but I'm living it now
and it just feels normal,
it just feels like
everything's legitimized.
It feels like...
Complete.
I feel like I've known her
my whole life.
It was like, yeah, she's like
the brightest, the smartest,
like, the most handsome girl.
No, but she's really great.
And it's nice. Yeah. I don't
even know how to describe it.
Yeah, no, I really want to be
closer to her now, I think.
'Cause we can't go back to
each other's lives completely,
now that we've met
and shared...
I just want to keep sharing
my things and my life,
my everyday life with her.
Yeah, being apart is
a bit difficult.
So I really miss her.
Already.
I can't do it.
Are you all right?
That's right. You got to
help me look for her.
Okay, she looks like me...
Yes, I know that, Sam.
...but tired.
We're gonna see the
similarities and
differences between you,
given your circumstances
of being separated at birth,
reared in completely
different environments,
but yet being
genetically related, so...
Samantha was 58
and three quarters
and Anais was 59 and a half.
Sorry.
Okay.
Stop!
I'm laying
in my bed right now,
and I'm mad because
my sister's a jerk,
and steals all the covers
in the middle of the night.
Look at her evil face.
We contacted
Spence-Chapin and they
tried to contact our mother.
And it's actually 
the second time
she's denied having us.
'Cause I tried to find her
when I went to Korea last year.
She was saying that
we had the wrong person.
That it wasn't her.
"She met the birth father
through her relative
and began to live
with him from 1985.
They had a two-year-old daughter
and had to support
the birth mother's family.
Under such circumstances,
she conceived the child
and was unable
to raise the child financially.
After all, she referred
the child to SWS
for adoption
for her better future.
The birth mother didn't want to
say about the birth father."
It feels like she gave
like two completely
different stories.
'Cause the information
doesn't, like, match up.
Yeah, with the first...
Maybe she didn't know that
she was pregnant with twins.
And then like
when they had twins that...
Yeah, probably.
But why wouldn't
they keep both of them?
One of them.
Like apparently people were
doing at the time.
Like, just giving away
one child.
Which is strange.
It's so pretty.
Once I got back from London,
I met up with this guy, Dan,
who was a friend of Kevjumba's,
and he was an adoptee as well.
And he told me about
this conference in Korea,
called the
International Korean
Adoptee Association.
There's over, like, 600
people going and from 
all over the world,
all Korean adoptees.
I presented very casually
to my sister to say like,
"Maybe we should go
to this conference.
It's cool. We should go."
And she's like,
"Yeah, it'll be cool."
And then it's always 
devil's advocate.
"Yeah, but if we go, 
then maybe my parents
won't be happy."
Or, "If we go, 
then I don't know what 
I'm going to do about work.
'Cause I don't have a job yet."
I can see on her face
what she's feeling.
If her cheeks 
start to get red,
and I know exactly where that
feels on my face if I'm
feeling a certain way.
So, when she plays
devil's advocate, I'm like,
"What are you doing?"
"There's something else.
There's something missing."
Going to Korea after
what had just happened
about six months before
sounded like a very...
scary trip.
Because we had no idea
what we would find there.
It feels like 
a huge step to take.
Another huge level.
Also, I thought we might
find more information
about our birth mother.
And it's going to be
a difficult story to take in.
And that it might hurt us.
Whereas, right now,
we're so happy.
Do you have that expression
as well in English?
The best is the enemy
of the good.
If you're always trying
to make it better, then
actually it's a mistake.
'Cause when you have something
that makes you happy,
then it should be 
enough already.
I think 
she was scared to face
25 years of this kind of
inner burning question,
an inner burning
shitty feeling.
I was like, "I want to go
and I think it'd be
great for you,
and I want you to see the
positive and the good
side about being adopted.
And the time is now
because this conference
isn't in Seoul,
in Korea,
for another three years,
so I think we should go now."
And I was like,
"Shit, am I pushing her into
something that she's not
ready to do?"
No, stop.
Let's go to Korea.
I just want to
see my sister and eat good
Korean food right now.
And see Sue.
Sue! Sue!
She was my 
tour guide last year.
She took me all around Korea
with my mom.
-Welcome back.
-Thank you!
Korea TV.
Oh, my God!
I couldn't believe it.
Are you serious?
I saw this when Ben told me.
And I couldn't believe it.
And I looked it up
and it was there.
Oh, my God.
Nothing secret.
So funny.
That's like a full story.
-Yeah, pretty much.
-Oh, my God.
Same to American news.
I'm so excited.
Heavy.
This is cool.
What happened?
We're at the wrong hotel.
Hi! You're so short.
Hey, you're wearing heels.
You're cheating.
Yeah, I know.
I'm so happy to see you.
-You have to eat it
with something?
-Yeah.
Wrapping sauce.
Definitely you're only nine
in that hairstyle.
128, 256...
512 little sizes...
16, sorry, 32. 64. 128. 256...
So cool.
Oh, my God.
There's this
really cool place, Tripitaka, 
and it has 
all of the scriptures,
the Buddhist scriptures.
It's so beautiful here.
Here, it's like
so beautiful and everything,
so it makes you proud of
being born in a country
with such a history.
But this trip to Korea as an
adult, I'm really happy
to do it with Sam.
Maybe before 
I would have said,
"Oh, maybe it's because 
I needed to go to Korea
to find my origins
and discover whatever."
But I think what I was
really missing was Sam.
Sam represents so much more
than the rest
because we have the same story
and we're like blood family.
Hi. How are you?
Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
This is Anais.
The babies.
Oh, my gosh.
The huge teddy.
It's so cute.
You were here
playing with the toys.
Yeah.
That big teddy bear,
that's mine.
 Can you 
maybe explain to me
what happened...
Our birth mother,
we tried to contact her,
and she's denied everything.
Yes.
Hopefully, in the future,
she opens her mind
and maybe change her mind
and she will contact us.
So she has
our phone number, so...
Do you get this reaction
a lot from birth mothers?
Sometimes it happens.
They're just afraid.
I believe your birth mother
is just not ready.
Yeah.
I assume so too.
Do you possibly
know why they
would have separated twins
or it could have been
a mistake even?
We don't know.
We were really shocked,
to get to know
about this, so...
We have no idea.
-Thank you.
-Thank you.
So this is from
our lawyer, yeah?
It's like they're
at the airport.
It's March 25
that I arrived.
When was yours?
Fifth of March.
So cool, huh?
-Your foster mother is here.
-Is she?
-Hi!
-Hi!
Hello, Samantha!
How are you? Oh, my God...
-Hello.
-Hello.
You're so pretty.
My foster mom, it's funny,
'cause life keeps bringing us
back together in a way.
And I really didn't think
that that was a thing.
I didn't think 
it was really possible
for me to see her
a year later, you know. 
I think the first time 
I met her, I didn't 
know what to do. 
'Cause I had no idea
what to expect.
I didn't know
anyone who had
gone through it before.
And that's scary.
That's always a really 
scary thing.
And I guess I was trying to
tell Anais that as well.
I wanted to help her
and I wanted her to 
remove fear of doing it.
Thank you.
I was really touched and moved
by her actions towards you.
I just wanted to hug her
and thank her for, like,
taking care of you.
When we were nothing like
but just crying babies,
and unable to feed ourselves.
You know?
She's really 
part of the family.
Bye.
Take care.
You've crossed
borders and bridges 
to find your way 
once again to Korea.
Welcome back.
Thank you so much.
I didn't realize
how big of an event it was.
It was really emotional
to see everyone together.
You feel like you're
a part of something.
Yeah, and just everyone
sharing something in common
and connecting with people.
It's so cool to be part of
something bigger than just us.
Everyone who is here 
is happy, I think.
You know you're going to have
a lot of fun for a whole week
with people that
understand you completely.
And you know 
that you're in Korea
and that your birth country
cares about you as well,
it's really moving.
Yeah, it's amazing.
-You're excited, yeah?
-Yeah.
I can tell you're super happy.
Pop.
It'll probably be close to...
Oh, here it is.
Post Adoptions Service Center.
One, two, three...
It's cool that 
Frank's an adoptee
from France, isn't it?
-Yeah, that's really cool.
-It's like a relief
for once, yeah?
So cool.
-Yeah!
-Are you ready, Pop?
-Yeah.
-Camera's on. Ready?
I think you were Anais.
She says she thought
you were me because of
the shape of the face.
Because you looked
like how I looked
when I was a baby.
She's saying if she could have
had us both to take care of,
she would have loved it.
It's really cool.
Like, everything she remembers.
Yes.
It's really interesting to
see how...
Well, to be here
in the country.
To understand...
Just to see where you were.
Where you came from.
I feel really good
meeting... Well, first,
like, finding my twin sister,
then finding my foster mother,
finding her foster mother.
It feels like a big family.
For me, it's a proof of love
and people caring.
My foster mother
took care of me from
the second day I was born.
And my birth mother, yeah,
if I could meet her,
it would make me 
very happy, of course.
I would be happy to know
what happened, exactly why.
But she doesn't seem like
she wants to be...
She doesn't seem like
she wants to be contacted.
Here's my address.
Before I used to say
that I wasn't born on
the 19th of November,
that I was born
on the fifth of March,
when I arrived in France.
So for me
there was no life before,
to me, because I was nothing
without my parents.
And... And, yeah.
Pop.
Yeah. Pop.
Oh, I have makeup on.
Yeah, now I see that
I existed before as well.
Yeah, it felt like,
you know, that you're...
I was abandoned,
and so I started
living with my parents.
Like, for me, being born...
Not being born at
the airport, but...
You know, just being when your
parents stop wanting you,
and I just realized...
Yeah, coming to Korea,
I think I just realized
that people loved me,
like, a long time before.
That was nice.
Pop?
Pop.
Happy?
Good.
Pop!
People keep 
asking us, if we could 
have been raised together,
if we would have?
And... I...
I say no.
I wouldn't change anything.
Because I wouldn't be here.
I wouldn't be who I am.
And neither would Anais.
I don't know, I'm not sure
if I believe in fate.
I know that's a funny thing
to say after everything
that's happened.
I don't like to think
that my life is planned out.
Do you know what she bought?
Like, the seaweed snacks.
She bought two
big things of them.
Dried, roasted...
Yeah, the roasted seaweed.
She has, like, 30 packages
of roasted seaweed.
What?
But it's just comforting
to know that life unfolds,
in a way
it's supposed to, I guess.
I have my sister now 
and I'm happy.
So it's not looking back
at what happened.
It's moving on.
Thank you for coming back
and finding this time with me.
Of course.
I have my parents,
I have my foster mom.
I have Anais's parents.
I have Sue, I have my sister.
I have my brothers.
Bye, Sue!
I have like five 
different types of moms
and that's okay.
And I love each 
and every one of them.
And I love my birth mom too.
I don't know her, and...
Still love her.
Family's what you make of it.
There's no definition.
We should tell her that, like,
we're not, like, mad at her.
We, like, care for her.
And if she wants to talk to us,
she can contact us
and, like, we love her.
We grew up our entire lives
without knowing about each
other.
We believe that
you are our mother.
We are together now
and are both very happy women.
Thank you for giving us
the gift of life.
And thank you for
giving us the chance to
have the best lives possible.
We would love
to speak with you one day.
Although we have never met,
we love you
and thank you for what
you have given to us.
We're not angry
that we were raised apart.
We're just happy
that we are together now.
If you want to contact us,
we're here and willing.
And we hope
you have a happy life.
Thank you, love, Anais...
Samantha.
-Pop!
-P.S.
Pop!
