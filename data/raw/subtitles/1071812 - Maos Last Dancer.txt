What's wrong?
Hmm.
My father work very hard,
have 50... 50 dollar... one year.
And you spend 500... one day.
Why you... why you do this?
Li, you know, I'm not
trying to influence you.
It's justwhat people
wear here, that's all.
I think that's probably why your
government gave youthis suit.
It's just a trifle out of date,
that's all.
I must give suit back.
Well, you can give these back
when you go home.
These can be yours to have
while you're here
at summer school and...
Why bird on?
(CHUCKLES) "Don't let
the turkeys get you down."
It's not a captalist thing,
Li, it's just...
Honesty, it's just
a bit of nonsense,
like a lot of things in America.
What it mean?
It means there are times
when you just have to be strong

Yeah, I know. It gets

a lousy disco dancer.

Dilworth, you like ballet?
I like ballerinas, Li. Very agile.

(DRAMATIC STRING MUSIC PLAYS)
Minister, you have some
realy wonderful dancers here.
We've run the summer program
for several years now
and we've been
very successful.
Yeah, I see.
It's a tremendous success.
I think they're talking about us.
Probably.
Because it would be wonderful
for the Houston Ballet.
The decision would
have to be made
by the party, Mr Stevenson.
Oh, of course,
I understand. Yes.
Alright.
BOBBY: How'd it go?
Well, they're going to
consider it.
I expect they take it
to the highest level.
MARY: Well, how long
will that take?
It's not up to me. It's up to
the Chinese Government.
WOMAN: We're ready for photograph,
Mr Stevenson.
Alright.

Um... foot... stretch
Oh, I can't.
Um, my ankle, I broke it.
Right here. They put a rod in it.
When they took the cast off
my calf had shrunk two inches.
It's fine now, I think.
It's just my confidence.
I'm sorry, you don't understand.
Um, I-I understand.
- You do?
- Uh...
No.
- En pointe. En pointe.
- OK.
This, turn out.
Yeah.
Better.
I'm Elizabeth, by the way.
Everyone calls me Liz.
- Liz?
- Yeah.
Like Li.
Everyone call me Li.
Yeah, I know who you are.
Li Cunxin.
- 'Schwinsin'?
- Mm.
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?
Um, it mean...
...'keep my innocent heart'.
Um... you dance with company?
Oh, no. No.
I was in the corps of...
'Nutcracker' once,
butthats as close as
I've come to getting a contract.
This is my second time
in the full-time program
trying to get Ben to notice me.
(LAUGHS)
- LI: Ben?
- BEN: Yeah?
Today, in street, someone speak me
word I not understand.
Um, not find in here.
What was it?
Um... 'chink'.
What it mean?
Um, let's see.
Do you know when
youre in the theatre,
and everyone is getting seated
andthe curtain is closed,
if the stage light is on,
and the curtain parts
just a tiny little bit
then the light from the stage
shines through
what we call a chink
in thecurtain.
So if someone calls you
a 'chink', Li,
what it means is that...
...they see the light
that's there inside of you.
Oh! Oh... fantastic.
And trace the leg,
follow the line.
Nice, Lori.
Pull back. Just feed her out.
And extend the leg. Lovely.
Good, good.
Yeah, yeah.
Very good. Very good. Alright?
LI: In Chnese, we say 'will go',
'go today', 'go tomorrow',
'go yesterday,
'you go', 'I go', 'she go',
'we all go'.
- (LAUGHS) Right.
- Much, much easier.
English changes all time.
Youre doing very well.
(SPEAKS CHINESE)
Thank you.
Chnese official not come here.
What do you mean?
- She lau ban
- Lau ban?
Um... boss person.
In China, class enemy.
She looks like an opera diva.
What? What is it?
I am with you, American girl.
Mm-hm.
Make trouble for Ben.
No.
It's OK. No one has to know.
Um... here. Try this.
What is it?
It's, um, vegetable from sea.
Good?
- God, it's so hard to chew
- Hard to chew.
- Yeah, like English!
