BENGALI YEAR 1327 (1920 C.E.)
Your glasses.
And sindoor.
- Did you see the monkey outside?
- Did a monkey get inside?
I meant your precious son.
No, I didn't.
I boiled some milk for him,
but he ran off.
And the boys
in this neighborhood...
This is a bustling city.
How can I keep an eye on him?
Isn't there a school nearby?
At least I could stop
worrying for two seconds.
Are you going out?
There's boiled milk.
- You said it was for Khoka.
- For you too.
- Really?
In the small bowl
in the kitchen.
The milk's good.
- Would you go to the market?
- Of course. What should I get?
- I'll tell you, but...
- Thinking about the money?
No need to pay cash.
- He'll give you credit?
You think I give
Ayurvedic treatments for free?
Then get some mustard oil,
kerosene, and garam masala.
And see if you can get
some mung dal...
either mung or masoor.
Apu's been asking
for khichuri
ever since he had some
the other day.
Anything else?
That'll do for today.
Can you get some good
paan masala?
- What brand?
- I don't know.
The woman upstairs
gave me some.
Find out the brand
and I'll get some tomorrow.
I ran into a sweets seller
I knew.
Says he has rheumatism.
I'm taking him this medicine.
- Really?
I could ask him for some
Benares cream. It's famous.
I know.
Shall I get some?
Let the medicine work first.
All right.
Gayatri.
Gayatri, listen.
Aren't you going to bathe
in the Ganges today?
If you don't,
you won't get salvation.
They just got here.
Let them settle in first.
They'll bathe in the Ganges
and pay homage
to Vishwanath,
all in good time.
Shambhu!
Water!
Apu, wait.
Don't you get hungry
running around all morning?
Did you have something outside?
What?
- Laddu.
Really?
And some peda too!
- Is Mr. Ray at home?
- No.
I brought him a calendar.
I got home too late last night
to give it to him.
Shall I put it in his room?
- Yes.
All right.
We bring one out every year.
You'll find all the important
holy days in it.
The holy festivals
are marked in red.
You can't miss them.
That means
"We bow before you, Lord Shiva,
O peaceful one,
O Shambhu,
ornamented
with the crescent moon
and adorned with serpents,
you who wield the divine bow
and dispel the darkness."
"O Lord of the world,
those devoted to you
are the blessed ones.
Those who worship you
are the holy ones.
Those who sing your praises..."
"Look!
She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast.
Wait till I tell my brother."
Then Jatila quietly
takes her brother Ayan
to her hiding place
and says...
"Brother, look there.
See what your wife Radha
is up to.
She weeps with her head
on Krishna's breast.
Wait! Where did they go?"
For in the meantime
Krishna had told Radha,
"Lay flowers at my feet
as an offering,
and I shall take
the form of Kali,
Ayan's favorite goddess."
Want to try swinging a club?
You sure?
Then allow me.
Come here.
- Who's the man upstairs?
- Nanda-babu.
Tell him your mother
has used up all the matches
and your father
isn't home yet.
Say your mother needs
two matches... just two.
Nanda-babu.
- Who's there?
- Me.
"Me" who?
Oh, come in.
What do you want?
- Matches.
- What for?
- Mother wants them.
Your mother does?
Just a minute.
That's my medicine.
I'm sick, you see.
The doctor says
to take it every evening.
Here.
She said just two.
Why? Just take the box.
I have more.
Listen.
Tell your mother
Nanda-babu says
she needn't return them.
You have a fine voice, sir.
Greetings.
It seems
you are a singer too.
I used to be.
- Do you live nearby?
- Why do you ask?
I wondered where
I might drink some tea.
It's turned chilly,
and my throat is sore.
See? I've been carrying
my tea leaves around.
Certainly. Come with me.
I live close by.
- You don't mind?
- No.
My name is Kalicharan Banerjee,
originally from Satkhira.
God knows if it's all right.
I want some too.
Later.
Take theirs out first.
Then come back
for the sweets.
Don't drop it.
Here we are.
Your son's very helpful.
Here.
Excellent tea.
Where's your son?
He's a good boy.
- Khoka?
Ah, there you are.
Tuesday I'll take you
to a feast at the Teota palace.
Will you come?
- Of course he will.
Every year
they host a feast
for Brahmans there,
and they send me
an invitation.
You wouldn't mind
if I took your son?
Not at all.
I don't mind telling you
I've managed to save
about 400 rupees
by practically starving myself.
Another hundred or so
and I can get myself a bride
from a decent family.
One can't be happy
without a family of one's own.
Wouldn't you agree?
Well, I'm off.
Hari-babu?
You wouldn't know of a girl...
I'm afraid I don't.
All right. Good-bye.
The Pandeys have gone
to the Ramlila performance.
Perhaps you could take Apu.
He's never seen it.
What do you say?
- Could you take these?
What's wrong?
What's the matter?
You're burning up.
When did this start?
I went to the market,
then to the sweets seller
for the cream,
then to the ghat
for evening prayers.
Then, as I was
climbing the steps...
That's enough. Lie back.
Apu's gone out for fireworks.
Why do you need him?
Shouldn't we call a doctor?
- No, don't bother.
- I'm not listening to you.
No, listen.
Look...
there are some packets
of herbal medicine
in that tin box.
Give me a dose.
Mix it well
with ginger or honey.
Let me try that for now.
It might work.
If not, then we'll see tomorrow.
Sit with your father.
He's not well.
Come here.
Sit down.
Did you get fireworks?
What kind?
Sparklers, silver stars,
and whistlers.
Fireworks here aren't as good
as back in the village, huh?
Were you watching
the fireworks from the roof?
Who's that?
- Shambhu.
Who's that?
He lives in Kukurgali.
He's Hindustani.
Your friend
who teaches you English?
I see.
What is "Apu bhalo chhele"
in English?
Invite him in.
He's going
to set off firecrackers.
- You want to go with him?
- Yes.
Go on, then.
- How are you feeling now?
- Much better.
Here.
You gave me a scare.
You must have caught a chill
from all your running around.
Take things easy now.
You're earning enough.
Listen.
- What?
- Come sit for a while.
I have to make up a bed for Apu.
You'll sleep on the cot tonight.
The sweets seller told me
about some lodgings.
Really?
Near the Man Mandir palace.
Two rooms facing south
on the second floor.
Seven rupees.
Markets and schools nearby.
Khoka won't have a problem.
We'll discuss it later.
You get better first.
What's Khoka doing?
Can't you hear him?
Look at that! Go away!
Benares is a nice place
except for the monkeys.
I should say!
You're going out?
- I have to go to the ghat.
But you had a bad fever!
I'm fine.
The medicine worked.
But up and down
all those steps again...
Excuse me.
Help me!
We heard nothing
during the night.
We got back late
from the performance.
Nothing
in the morning either.
My wife was on her way
to the ghat
when she heard
he'd fallen down unconscious.
I hope he wasn't hurt.
He must have been.
Those are stone steps.
For one thing,
his chest is congested.
This room is damp.
Keep the doors
and windows closed
so he's not exposed to cold.
Someone must come with me.
I'll prescribe some medicine.
I'll go.
If you have mustard oil
and camphor,
heat some and rub it
on his chest and back.
That will help.
- All right.
What do you think?
If you need anything,
let me know.
Please don't hesitate.
Mr. Ray?
Ma'am.
My dear,
are you preparing paan?
Get out! Right now!
I'm going!
I just wanted some paan.
Did you say something?
Water...
You want water?
Ganges...
Apu, get up.
Go get some water
from the river.
Take this pot,
and hurry back.
Wait. Put this on.
Khoka...
He'll be back any minute.
Khoka's back.
Come here.
This is Apu.
Pay your respects
to your great-uncle.
How old is he?
He's ten now.
- When was he given the sacred thread?
- After we came to Benares.
Will you come with me?
I can't make up my mind, Uncle.
I hadn't thought of leaving here.
I didn't even know
you were coming.
I always come around this time.
I had no idea
you were so badly off.
Yes, you did write
that you were coming.
- What are these people like?
- They're good people.
I've heard
they're happy with my work.
They want to take me
with them to Dewanpur.
I can't make up my mind.
Think it over.
I'll be here a few more days.
If you come stay with me,
the place will get lived in,
and you'll have all you need.
Think it over.
Run along now.
Listen.
Go to that table
and open the drawer.
No, the next one.
Bring me that leather pouch.
Come in.
- You called?
- You're coming with us, right?
- Where?
- Didn't they tell you?
We're going
to Dewanpur next month.
I told you I'd take you along
if I liked your work.
I hope you'll come.
You have relatives here?
And no one back home?
Then come with us.
Very well.
By the way, Moksada says
you've lost your appetite.
You don't have a fever?
You feel all right? Good.
Sukhen, take this.
And go tell the other house
that I'm back.
Mother! A train!
I lit the stove.
You have enough food?
Yes, all we need for today.
Then I'll be back tomorrow.
Just let me know
if you need anything.
You didn't tell me your name.
Nirupama.
I'll be leaving in a week or so.
Will you be settled in by then?
Apu, come with me tomorrow.
You can learn
your duties as a priest.
Place some tulsi leaves
with sandal paste on the deity.
And now some flowers.
Now take the deity...
No, wash them first.
What's the matter with you?
You've been sulking
since this morning.
Are you sick?
Are you sad?
Do you miss Benares
or the village?
Don't you like it here
in Mansapota?
Tell me what's wrong.
Have they been rude to you?
Have you been doing
your job properly?
These are good people.
If we keep them happy,
our livelihood is secure.
Put up with it for a few years.
Then, with any luck...
Mother?
- What?
- I want to go to school.
- Go where?
- To school.
- Where?
- Close by. It's a good school.
How do you know?
I went and saw it.
- What about your work?
- School is in the afternoon.
- Can you do both?
- Yes.
Doesn't school cost money?
Who'll pay for it?
Don't you have any money?
Keshab-babu?
Are the refreshments ready?
Only half an hour left.
Jagadish-babu!
I'll see to it, sir.
Baikuntha!
Welcome.
- Welcome.
- Be seated.
What are you teaching them?
- Bengali, sir.
"The Shoots and Stalks
of Literature."
What does "stalk" mean?
Tell us.
"Stalk" means... um...
It means "a stem."
Good.
Let's hear you read.
"The Land of Bengal
Where is
the greenest land of all...
where on tender grass
your feet must fall?
Where grain sways
on sunny afternoons
and the blushing lotus blooms?
It is our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all.
Where do thrush
and robin sing?
Where do
fork-tailed drongos swing,
and where do
elegant swans swim?
Where do weaverbirds
nest again
and the swallows cry for rain?
In our very own Bengal,
the greenest land of all.
In what land
do they speak a tongue
that fills your soul
with yearning?
Where do you hear
the clear tones
of a baul
whose heart is singing?"
Where's the signature?
This is the 23rd.
How can you remember so much
but forget that?
Go get it signed.
Ah, Apurba.
Come in.
Is your mother well?
The inspector
was very pleased with you,
and I was as well.
I've been keeping an eye
on your progress.
I've spoken
to Abinash-babu about you.
He's far ahead
of the average student.
We have high hopes
for you, you know.
For our part,
we'll provide you
with every means
to advance in your studies.
But if you really want
to be a good student,
you'll have to work hard.
In particular...
you'll have to improve
your English.
Do you like to read?
I don't mean textbooks.
Books about travel,
or the lives of great men,
or books about science,
written in simple language.
If I give you books like that,
will you read them?
Of course he will.
Good.
Here in this bookcase...
I have lots of books like that.
If you don't read
books like these,
you can't broaden your mind.
We may live
in a remote corner of Bengal,
but that doesn't mean
that our outlook
should be narrow.
This is about the North Pole.
Anyone who wants to know
about the aurora borealis
or how the Eskimos live
will find it all in there.
This is about
Livingstone's travels.
It will teach you about Africa.
This is
The Story of Inventions.
You can learn
all about inventions in here.
These are biographies
of famous scientists:
Galileo, Archimedes,
Newton, Faraday...
Come look!
These are the sun,
the Earth, and the moon.
The moon circles the Earth,
and when it gets here,
the shadow is called an eclipse.
Apu, get up.
It's time to eat.
The food's getting cold.
Come in, Apurba.
You came in second
in the district. Sit down.
- That's all right.
- No, sit down.
You're going to continue
your studies, aren't you?
If so, you can get
a scholarship of ten rupees.
I could help make arrangements
for you in Calcutta.
Have you given it any thought?
- Yes, sir.
- You'll continue on?
- Yes, sir.
In Calcutta?
Arts or sciences?
Good.
You have anywhere
to stay there?
Any relatives?
Well, that shouldn't be
a problem.
Have you spoken
to your mother?
Not yet.
- Think you can convince her?
- I'll try.
- Why so late?
- I was second in the district!
- What's that mean?
- Only one boy ahead of me.
Really?
I might even get
a scholarship.
Money for doing well
on my exams.
- How much?
- Ten rupees a month.
Ten rupees?
But only if I continue
my studies.
Is that so?
Of course. Think they'd give it
to me just like that?
I have to go study
in Calcutta.
You know what this is?
- Then you're going?
- Why not?
Everyone does.
That's why
the headmaster called me in.
He gave me addresses
and said it will be fine.
And who'll pay for it?
Pay for what?
College will be half free.
I'll get ten rupees a month,
and I'll find work.
What about me?
Am I to be tossed aside?
Think they'll take care of me
if you stop being their priest?
So I can't study?
I have to be a priest?
Why not? You're a priest's son.
You want to be a governor?
- Yes!
- Quiet!
- So everything has to be your way?
- Yes!
There are snakes out here.
The mosquitoes will eat you up.
Come back inside.
- No.
Don't be childish!
You can go to Calcutta.
How? You won't be able
to manage here.
Did I say that?
Just think it through first.
- You slapped me!
- I'm sorry. I won't do that again.
Come on.
I have something to show you.
Look.
Whose is that?
Remember
when I worked in Benares?
You know how much I saved?
Thirty-two rupees.
Good thing I did.
I'll give you some.
It'll get you through a month.
- Look what the headmaster gave me.
- What is it?
It's called a globe.
It's the Earth.
These lines are countries,
and the blue is ocean.
You know where Calcutta is?
- It's 7:30!
- Come look where I've put things.
- That's all right.
- No, come look.
Here's your drinking glass,
and your hair oil.
Here's your bowl,
with some sweets in it.
These are spices,
and here's some ghee I made.
Your shirts and vests
are under these books.
And your dhoti
is with your bedding.
And two postcards.
Write the minute you arrive.
Put these in there.
Here are five rupees
from the Teli family,
and 25 from me.
Keep one rupee on you
for the train ticket.
And stop in
at Nirupama's on your way.
They've done so much for you.
- What about my globe?
- You'll have to carry it.
Keep the key safe.
- I'm off.
- Wait.
Write me with all the news.
Be careful
getting around the city.
Don't eat strange food
or you'll get sick.
Come home at the puja festival
if you get a few days.
Have you ever tripped
and hurt yourself?
If not, you'll have
plenty of opportunity
in the future.
That's when
this amazing balm
will come to your aid
like a trusty friend.
How about you, my friend?
Excuse me.
Are you Akhil-babu?
What is it?
- I have a letter.
- What letter?
From the headmaster
of the Arboal school.
Let me see.
Sit down.
Yes, Paresh wrote to me
about this.
You've come here
to study, right?
You have any money?
Mother gave me 30 rupees,
so I have 29 rupees
and six annas left
after paying train fare.
Can I rent a room here?
I only have the one room,
but we'll make do.
- How much is rent?
- Well...
can you work
in the printing shop?
At night, after your classes
during the day?
Good.
Go up those stairs
and you'll find the room.
It's right in front.
I'll be right up.
"Dear Mother,
I've arrived safe and sound.
Akhil-babu
has arranged for my stay.
I'll be working in his printing shop
instead of paying rent.
I have an electric light
in my room."
Me, sir?
What's going on?
Couldn't you find a better place
to sleep than CCB's class?
Are you crying?
Come on. We have
two free periods after this.
Let's take a walk.
Apu, wouldn't you like
to go abroad?
Sure.
Find me a job on a ship.
I'm serious.
What do you say
we go traveling together?
Well?
Have you no ambition?
You'd stay here,
like a frog in a well,
even if you got
the chance to go?
Why?
Mother would never let me.
Why not?
She didn't even like me making
the three-hour trip to Calcutta.
- How'd you manage?
- I put up a fight.
If I had no ambition,
I'd have stayed there.
I even had a job there.
- A job?
Doing what?
- I was a priest.
Really? Was that
your family profession?
You wear the sacred thread?
No Brahman's pigtail?
You realize
we missed two periods?
That was a big mistake.
We should have told Pranab
to answer for us at roll call.
There'd have been
no problem in PNG's class.
Have you gotten taller?
Then you've lost weight.
Did you get my letter?
I'm not speaking to you.
Why?
Your break began the 7th.
What's today?
I had some work.
Admit you didn't want
to come see your mother.
It's evening.
You'll catch cold.
Come out of there.
What do they feed you there?
- All kinds of stuff.
- Like what?
Lentils, rice, fish, vegetables.
- Who cooks?
- There's a cook.
Is he a good cook?
Better than me?
Better than me?
Next time you come home,
bring me some shell buttons.
You hear me?
Put that book away.
Tell me.
- Tell you what?
What have you seen
in Calcutta?
- All kinds of things.
- Like what?
The Victoria Memorial...
Whiteway Laidlaw...
Hogg Market, the zoo...
Fort William.
The temple at Kalighat?
Yes, just the other day.
That...
and Keoratola.
What's that?
- A burning ghat.
- What?
A cremation grounds.
Are you careful
out on the streets?
When will you pass
your exams and get a job?
I'll come stay with you then,
all right?
Will you let me?
Perhaps it's not my fate.
Who knows if I'll live that long?
- Nonsense.
- You think it's funny?
What if I get seriously ill?
It happens.
My health isn't
what it used to be.
Every evening
I feel feverish and dizzy.
I have no appetite.
I've often thought of telling you,
but I never have.
You're not about
to quit your studies
to come stay with me,
are you?
When you earn money,
will you arrange treatment for me?
Will you, Apu?
Build your bodies, my friends
Make them strong
Be flexible and limber, my boy
Amaze us with your feats
Take it nice and slow
Build your bodies, my friends
Amaze us
with your feats, my boy
Build your bodies, my friends
You want some paan?
Did you hear
what Nirupama said?
Did you?
Yes.
You'll go, right?
- Why? She's asked many times.
- I have classes Monday.
What's it matter
if you're two days late?
You wouldn't understand.
It does matter.
What's to understand?
Everyone takes an extra day or two.
You were a week late
getting here.
There are no holidays
until New Year.
They're so happy to see you.
Will you do it?
Move.
Out of the way.
There's never time
to pack in the morning.
I always have to run
for the train.
Sunrise is at 6:15.
Wake me up in time.
Mother, why didn't you
wake me up?
Now I'm late.
- I'm off.
- The key.
Did you check everything?
- There's no time.
One for Sealdah Station.
Here comes the train!
I missed the train.
What will you do?
I'll go tomorrow.
Your studies won't suffer?
Would you like
something to eat?
A little later.
Dear Apu,
why don't you write regularly?
I worry
when I don't hear from you.
Do you have a break
during the Ganesh puja?
If so, come home.
I haven't seen you
in two months,
and I long to see you.
If you don't have enough money,
I'll send you some.
"Dear Mother,
there is no break
during the Ganesh puja,
and I have exams soon.
If I don't stay in Calcutta,
my studies will suffer."
Anyone home?
I think of stopping by every day,
but I never get around to it.
Are you well?
- Yes. Sit down.
Have you heard from Apu?
- Yes.
- Is he well?
Your son is a real gem.
You should get him married.
With a daughter-in-law,
your worries would be over.
You're all alone.
I think of visiting you every day,
but there's never time.
It's always
one thing or another.
Yesterday my son-in-law
arrived from Kalna.
He and his father work
in a shop they have there.
You can't imagine
the goings-on there!
Two sons,
and grandchildren too.
The mother died,
and five months later
the father remarried!
Auntie?
Were you sleeping?
Has your fever gone up again?
- Oh, my.
What will I do with all those?
- Why don't you go inside?
- In a while. Sit down.
I can't stay now.
I must go prepare medicine
for Umi's cough.
I'll come by
this evening if I can.
And I hope
you won't be cross,
but we've written
to your uncle.
Why did you do that?
He's an old man.
Did you write to Apu?
He has time off from school
today and tomorrow.
Is he coming?
Shall I write to him?
- No!
If he comes...
he has to come on his own.
He has his studies,
and exams
are around the corner.
It's best he stay there.
You mustn't write him.
Promise me.
Give me your word.
I'm going now,
but I'll come by again.
So will the others.
There's a door open.
Shall I close it?
- I'll do it later.
- Very well.
I'll leave these
on the veranda.
Hey!
I never expected to find you here.
- Why?
Weren't you going home
for two days?
To your village...
Mansapota, was it?
Nah.
I can't study there.
I just fall asleep.
- Won't your mother be angry?
- No, I took care of that.
I sent her a money order
from a bonus
Akhil-babu gave me.
I see.
Aren't you nervous?
A little.
I'm not quite ready
for the chemistry exam.
- Want one?
- Nah.
Go on.
Watch out!
There's a letter for you.
Put this on the press.
From your mother?
From Niru-di. Mother is ill.
Is it serious?
Don't cry, Apu.
Parents don't stay
with you forever.
What happened had to happen.
Now you should perform
the shraddha...
and then stay on here.
You'll earn enough as a priest.
My boy...
Where are you off to?
What for?
I have exams.
And your mother's shraddha?
I'll take care of it in Calcutta,
at the Kalighat.
THE END
