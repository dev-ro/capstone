When the training is over,
you can't find a job.
- But you never worked in
construction before...
What I'm saying is you should
warn people.
Tell the people.
Warn them.
Don't send people to a training
if you know there's nothing after.
You don't do this to people,
you treat them well.
You understand?
Here I am, in your office,
I have the feeling
that I always come back here, and...
- I will tell you honestly,
the training for crane operator,
considering your background...
- I would not suggest you to do it.
- Maybe,but I did it anyway.
- Well, now it's done.
- I made it...
When we... The...
If you didn't work on the ground before,
you can't work in the crane up there.
But we have not been told this before !
So at the end, we were a group of 15,
13 people never went 
on a construction site in their life...
And for them, it was a complete
waste of time.
So, either you tell people there will
be nothing at the end,
or you send them to a useful
training.
I honestly think you should
have been told this before.
Now, it's done...
I think we will have
to find another way...
I suppose you went to all the companies
looking for crane operators?
You contacted all the construction 
companies in the area?
Yes, but I lost 4 months.
Between the training,
and the resumes I have sent,
I lost 4 months.
- Now, the purpose...
... is to try and get a job.
- But In 9 months, I will get in the
welfare program.
I'll get 500 euros each month.
How will I survive with that?
How will I pay all my bills?
How will I live?
In 9 months. Tomorrow, basically.
- Listen, all I can do now,
is to work on your resume,
see which companies
we can contact...
- You mean go back to zero.
-Well, yes. I won't lie to you...
Everything I've done before 
was completely useless ?
You shouldn't have attended
this training, but...
You should have told me that.
Miss Rouault...
Nobody told me anything !
In fact, you send people...
You are playing with people.
Not you personally...
Then, of course,
We have money during training.
But everyone gets money.
The trainer and...
And at the end,
I have no job.
- I waste my time.
- Well, with this training...
Clearly, this training
is not for everybody.
There are other trainings
for people like you,
who want to change...
- I'm listening.
- For example, there is one
to learn to work for a supermarket,
as a driver,
But it requires another training...
Ok, but if at the end,
I am told that they will not hire me,
because I didn't work before
on some machine whatever,
then it's useless !
- Yes, but after...
- It's been 15 months now.
- But it's the employers
who decide to hire. Not us.
We try to target trainings
where the job... Huh...
In this case, honestly...
- I am not the first one !
I was not alone,
on this training for crane operator,
We were 15 !
13 came back,
13 for whom it was useless !
I am not the first one !
I will finish after. Start now,
while it's hot.
Can I have salt,
please?
I'll get it.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Gently.
Bon app√©tit.
You know,in a glass of water like that,
in an empty glass of water,
do you know how many
drops of water you can put?
Drops of water?
How many drops of water
you can put in an empty glass?
No.
Well...
Like that?
No!
Not how, but how many?
Well I don't know. A lot.
- Lots of water drops.
- No!
No!
- It is a riddle?
- Yes!
Hold on. How many drops of water
in an empty glass, right?
I know, zero. Zero.
- Because the glass is not empty then?
- It's a friend
who told me this
today at school.
- Well, zero?
- No.
- I don't get it !
- How many droplets...
- How many?
- Yes.
Drops of water in an empty glass.
- One!
After you put one, it's not empty.
Yes!
- We understood, thanks to the many
documents we found, 
that the company was financially ok,
So we contest all of our 
so-called "economic" job terminations.
You can prove this?
Yes, anyway, during the meetings,
There was expert reports
which were clear.
There was no economical reason.
The company made profits.
It is in the expert reports,
and in the hands of our lawyers.
in our own reports as well
The lawyers say that even
the branch reports
are in some respects
beneficial for us.
So it's good for us.
- All I say,
If I may,
without judging you at all...
I know that you know more
than me about these events,
- Me...
- Not really.
- But hear what I have to say.
- But you don't know less.
Right now, I feel like
I'm turning around in a circle,
I have to move forward.
I don't know if this can be useful,
And it's true that... huh...
For everything, I am...
- What do you mean, "move forward" ?
- I am tired.
I am tired. I am tired.
- So, that's it.
- We're all tired.
I don't want anything to do with Perrin.
Enough with Perrin.
- Thierry is right.
- It pisses me off as much as you.
I suffered as much as you.
I lost my job too.
and for me too, 
life was hard after that.
I think that in order for us to move on,
the bastards who put us in that shit
have to pay for what they did.
For me, this is the best solution.
- I'm just saying
that I wish to move forward.
You understand what I say?
- I would understand if you had 
a new job, but you don't.
You have not won the lottery.
This is not going to eat up your life !
- I am looking for work.
- But we're all looking !
I know.
This is not going 
to stop you from searching !
It is not a matter of time or money,
Even though I think you could
put your energy somewhere else.
But that's not the point. 
For me, morally, that's it.
I got hurt, I've paid enough, it's OK.
I lost a job.
With Perrin, I'm telling you, I'm done.
Let me finish.
To start a procedure is as if 
I was going to live it all again.
I'm not afraid.
I was there during the fighting.
Nobody said that...
- Answer me. I was there, right?
But of course you were there...
Why did you come?
It is because, precisely...
Listen. honestly, guys,
I'm telling you.
What we need.
Tomorrow, we gather 700...
Tomorrow or another day,
I don't know, we'll see,
- We will gather 750 guys.
- If they come.
Stop being negative.
Respect the struggle there.
Sorry, I'll say otherwise.
- I won't let 750 guys down.
I want to help people.
I want to do
what we said we would do.
we said we would go after them
and we would make them pay.
That's all I want.
Period.
Me, I didn't change my mind.
That's all.
- Don't tell me that...
- Each one choses
what he wants to do.
Me, for my sanity,
I prefer to draw a line,
move on to something else.
Can you hear it?
Am I a coward because of that ?
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Sorry.
- No problem.
- Mr... Tougourdy, right?
- Yes.
- OK.
- First, I wanted to thank you
for accepting
to make this interview on Skype.
You're welcome.
- Listen, we are looking for
machine tool programmers.
I had your resume 
through the employment agency,
On which machines
did you work?
I worked on Cornwell
at the beginning,
And then, Kieran.
- And the version of the lMH,
was it the 7 or 8 ?
It was the 7.
We worked on the 7
until the closure of the plant,
so I couldn't work on the 8.
- And you didn't want 
to have information...
- about the 8, while...
- Ah, yes of course !
I did, but the 8...
Well, I know
there are differences...
It is an integrated system
which works on Profibus and...
But it is difficult to access
technical documents
When you are not on the machines.
And I worked only on 7.
But I think I could adapt
very easily.
- OK.
There is still an important matter
I need to discuss with you.
Do you think that you would agree
to accept a position
below the one
you had previously?
Yes, I think.
- You think or you are sure?
- No, I'm sure. Positive.
No, of course. Of course.
- You understand that it means
a lower salary as well?
Yes I know.
But...
No, it suits me perfectly.
- OK.
- Are you available right now?
- Yes.
- Good.
Ah yes. There is something
I have to say,
I don't want to make you feel bad,
I think that the wording
of your resume...
How can I say... Your resume could
have a better wording.
- Really, I don't want
to give you a lesson...
No, no, but...
- Listen, I say this for you.
This is important, 
a well written resume...
The way you talk about yourself...
It's not clear as it is.
Ah really?
Well, it's the first time I'm told this.
Maybe It's hard for me to...
I was under the impression
that it was quite clear...
On the contrary.
- It is not my opinion.
- I understand.
- I won't say more, I'm not here
to give you a writing course.
- OK. Listen...
- I'll change it, anyway.
- Also, are you are flexible,
with working times?
It is important for us.
- Yes, very flexible.
- Very flexible.
- Yes, well I mean...
- Well, listen, that's it.
I'll continue checking around,
I have other candidates to see.
I think that you will have an answer
within two weeks maximum.
- All right?
- Very well.
And is it you who contacts me?
Or me who contacts you?
- Should I call you back?
- Absolutely not.
- You will be sent an email.
- Ah, OK. OK.
- It's much easier this way.
There is one last thing, it's important.
I want to be honest with you,
There is very little chance
for you to be hired.
I'm not saying
there no chance at all
but there's very little chance. OK?
It's important for me
to tell you.
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you, you too.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr.
1,2,3,4
Attention if you are ahead.
1,2,3,4
1,2,3.
Here, it's the N.1 who is behind.
Just after 4, I go back.
3,4
And the other foot stays in front.
We leave the other foot in front.
It's not bad at all,
with the rythm.
It's a rock n'roll rythm.
One step out of two
is more accentuated.
Wait a little bit,Thierry,
I will announce the figures.
1,2,3,4.
1,2, women pass.
Men pass.
On site.
Once again.
Women pass,
men pass.
And on-site.
Now we turn
with both hands down.
Go ahead.
Once again.
And on-site.
1,2,3,4.
Once again, in both directions.
Two times in a row. This is it.
This time, we will do 
3 figures in a row. Go ahead.
First...
Second...
This is it!
Perfect, the rythm is good.
Continue.
Ok. That's it, evenly distributed.
And now you pass.
Well, good.
Perfect.
Well it's done !
I would like to see the elasticity.
We will do both.
So, I am doing the woman,
to feel how it goes.
OK. Raise your head.
Now, relax your arms.
That's it.
Let your arms unfold.
OK. Good.
Go a little away from me,
because we will make a figure.
Go ahead.
That's it.
You can pass below.
Good !
Again.
Come with me.
Pass behind.
Great !
Now, together.
You're a little bit off rythm.
Wait, the music
will tell us when to start.
Did you think about 
financing his studies?
- The good news is
that they said that
housing was fully taken care of.
- Housing? Why?
It won't be in the area?
No, it's about 150 km from here.
- OK.
So, housing is 100% taken care of.
On the other hand, Matthieu needs
a life assistant.
And this is only partially
taken care of.
and the rest, it's...
- It's us.
- It's you.
And how much would it cost?
- It's about 300 euros.
- 300 euros?
- Yes.
- All right.
So 300 euros that you will have to
 spend each month, very soon...
- We want him
to continue school.
- I totally understand.
He struggles...
- It is your priority. I understand.
Yes, this is my priority.
- It's normal.
Well actually,I have found,
Since your income decreased,
that you tend
to use your savings
to make payments
on your deposits account
to avoid being in the red
at the end of the month.
This is the case.
Did you have
unforeseen expenses recently?
- No, we are careful.
You are careful ?
- Yes.
Did you consider, maybe,
selling
the apartment?
To finish paying for the loan
and retrieve some money
in order to constitute
a capital, just in case?
- Yes, but no.
No?
For what reason?
- We talked with my wife...
- Yes?
And...
Well...
First, we have only 5 more years...
- To pay back,Yes.
- Yes, to pay back.
And it would be as if
everything we'd done so far
was for nothing.
- Yes, I understand...
It is the only thing
that belongs to us.
And therefore...
- OK, but that would be...
... temporary.
- Yes, but no.
- You sell,
You get money,
It allows you to be in rental
with a rent lower than what
you pay today in credit.
And when you find yourself
a stable situation,
You may buy a new place?
- I don't know if it's possible.
- Of course it is.
- No.
If I sell, I don't know
If I can buy again later.
And if we can't buy again,
We are tenants.
And at my age, to be tenant,
It's no.
- OK. So you have...
- This is the last solution.
We didn't consider.
- You thought about it
but you chose not to.
But did you also consider
a situation, obviously
less pleasant to consider...
Tomorrow, what will happen
If you're not here anymore?
I mean...
If you die.
Do you have something planned,
did you set something up?
I'm talking about insurance contracts,
death insurance contracts.
which would provide 
the payment of a capital
to your loved ones,
in order to protect them.
- No.
I think it's something
you should consider...
When there is not
enough savings aside,
I think that a death insurance
would allow you
to plan the future more serenely.
All right?
It's a useful expense.
It's an expense which would
allow you to prepare the future
of those you love,
quite simply.
An additional protection.
Today, your situation
is unsafe,
And today, I think
this could make you feel better
about the future.
Forget it.
- Hey, look, they arrived.
- Yes.
- My wife, Karine.
- Enchanted. My wife.
Did you wait a long time?
-15 min.
So, it's this one.
Be careful
because it slips, there.
I go first?
There is a satellite dish?
-Yes.
Is it connected to the outside?
- To the antenna.
- Then there are shelves,
a cupboard in the entrance.
Here is the kitchen area
and the dining room.
- There was a table with 4 chairs
but it was an English model,
so there was a couch here.
But it was not practical.
We thought it's more user friendly,
the table and chairs.
It's also more convenient.
- And it can be used outside also.
- Yes,if necessary.
And to clean it,
you put the chairs on the table,
While the couch,
it can't be moved...
No, I like it like that.
And this is...
- The kitchen. Go ahead.
There is a lot of storage space,
It's very convenient.
And there.
Drawers, small cabinets.
- Storage space under the sink.
It's not too high for you, this?
You will use a small stool.
- No, it's OK.
Hot water.
There is a water heater
which is connected to a gas cylinder.
There is also a gas bottle
for the cooker.
- A small oven.
- Yes.
The oven is cute.
It's nice.
And in good condition.
Is there a small market in the area,
where they sell gas bottles?
-It's outside the camping.
- You have to go out of the camping?
- Yes, but there's 500 m. only.
- Let's go this way.
- The night area.
- Yes.
After you.
- Will you come here,Titi?
- Otherwise I'll do like this.
- You can open it.
Can you hold it, Honey?
- This is the shower,actually.
Shower, washbasin.
- Small storage space...
- Yes, here as well.
The heater.
- The mobil-home is from which year?
- It's 16 years old.
We have it since...
- 10 years.
But it's 16 years old.
Because when I see
this locker, here...
- I can tell it's 16 years old.
- Yes, it's true!
- And the window here...
- We will change it.
Yes, it's nothing...
I will fix it.
- Here, the toilets.
You can open.
Every door
open completely.
- OK.
We are interested
but it should be a little cheaper.
It's a bit expensive.
What can you do?
How far can you go?
We are already below
the price of the market.
- But you can make a small gesture...
- For me, it's worth 6000 euros.
6000 euros?
- Ah, no...
No, no.
No, between 7000 and 6000,
it's a difference of 1000 euros.
It's not possible
for us.
Yes, but on your ad,
it says 35 m2.
I just measured,
it's 33.
the mobil-home didn't shrink,
It's 35.
We can
measure it again if you want...
We agreed on 7000 euros.
Plus we travelled by car.
No, no, I can't...
- We can make a small...
It has been estimated at 7500,
It's already low.
- 7000 euros is still high.
- No, no.
I didn't talk money over the phone
but I hadn't seen the mobil-home.
I was not going to discuss the price
before seeing it.
OK, but I described it,
I explained you how it was...
No, we could talk about 100,
200 euro maybe...
I can propose 6900...
- I can climb to 6200.
- Ah, no.
Listen, I looked at the argus.
If you want, we look together.
No, but I don't need to.
- We did it to set the price.
- We did it.
A mobil-home like this,
It's between 7500 and 8000 euros.
As I told you,
It's already below the market.
There is a small terrace,
the insulation is new...
I told you about the water heater
just now...
- It's 16 years old...
Look at the floor,
it's not perfect...
I can go up to 6300,
but at some point...
There are still
a few things to change.
And then, there is no
direct access to the beach,
so we can re-evaluate the price.
Here, no mobil-home 
has access to the beach.
No, I'm telling you,
really, 6900...
And really, it's a good price...
It's below market.
I can't go down more.
- Anyway, at 6900,
you will not sell.
I don't think so.
I looked around,
at 6900, it will not go.
- It's your choice.
- No, really.
- 6300, I don't mind.
You see, I make an effort,
I go up to 6300.
- I pay you cash.
- That's not the question.
We made a deal on the phone,
We came here...
- And so did we.
We saw. 6300...
We sit down, we fill the papers,
I write your check...
and your problem is solved,
It's sold.
Everyone is happy.
No, but frankly, Sir,
I am not here to beg.
We care about this mobil-home.
We sell it for...
personal reasons.
It is below the market
because we need to sell it.
We talk on the phone.
You tell me OK for 7000.
I'm OK for 6900,
even 6800.
Below, it's not possible.
- I see,
you don't want to lower the price
because you put emotion in it.
You have certainly lived
lots of things in this mobil-home,
but it's not worth more than 6300.
You won't sell it for more than 6300.
But at the same time,
we are really interested,
so it's a win - win situation.
You leave with the check.
It's not about this.
I'm not begging for money.
- We sell our mobil-home...
- It's not begging,
but it allows you to
to move on to your future projects...
You know what we are going to do?
We will stop right here.
It's a deal,
If we can not discuss the price...
No, it's not...
Wait, honey, two minutes.
This is not "discussing the price".
At one point, there was a commitment.
I can make an effort.
But 6300, no way.
I proposed you 6900.
Let's end this now.
I don't want to sell anymore,
now. This is it.
- I propose now
a specific situation.
Imagine
your hierarchical superior,
you make him a suggestion,
a proposal,
and He actually
doesn't take it into account.
- How would you react?
- I react well.
- I would try to explain him
why I think this way.
I think I would insist
a little bit.
- But in this situation,
He doesn't want your idea at all.
How do you react?
- I would ask him
to explain me why,
to understand.
- Thank very you much,
Mr. Tougourdy.
- Here, you had the opportunity
to see the performance of Thierry.
I guess you already have
a first impression
about the video.
But let's first use
the grid I have given you
and we will focus
on these various points.
The first is the General Behaviour.
What do you think of
Thierry's behaviour?
- Not very dynamic, honestly.
A little bit buried in his chair.
- Yes, indeed.
Who else shares this opinion?
- I agree.
I also think
that the open shirt...
I don't know which position
you were applying to,
but I think
it's a bit too much relax...
- Indeed.
Thierry, it's true that you were
slumped in that Chair.
The General Behaviour
basically shows
the image you give of yourself
without the words.
55% of your image goes
through your body position,
And the idea is to show the recruiter
that you want to be there,
and to "open the door" to the job,
If I may say so.
I don't know if you understand
what I mean.
This is something
very important.
What about his amiability?
- A little cold, I think.
Remote. Not very smiling.
- Indeed, very well.
- If I can add something...
When you said Hello,
He didn't say "Hello" back.
It's participates...
- Very well.
In real life,
would you want to chat
with the Thierry
that we see in the video?
- Well not me.
- It's true.
Amiability is really
something very useful
in an interview.
The idea here is to give
a good feeling to the recruiter.
During the interview, He tries to
visualize you at the position,
the way you will behave
when you start working in the company.
And this is very important,
to show this amiability
during the interview.
- I don't know what you think of it?
- Yes, I...
I agree.
- Well. All right.
What about his eyes?
What is your opinion?
- He seeks...
- He's thinking.
He looks like He's not here.
Even though he's making an interview.
- OK.
He gives the feeling
that He doesn't open up easily.
He is slightly backing away,
He doesn't answer clearly.
He looks like He doesn't give it 100%.
He doesn't show if He cares.
- OK.
The strength of the voice?
Go ahead.
- I think that it is correct.
- Could you hear or not?
- Yes, we could hear well.
- Yes, we could hear it.
- I agree.
The voice was okay.
Not too strong.
At times, it falls down,
but still understable.
- Very well.
- I actually thought
it was not easy to hear.
- You couldn't hear well?
- At the end, it was going down.
- OK.
- At times, yes.
So let's talk about 
the rythm of the speech now.
What do you think?
- It's lazy.
I think it's lazy.
- OK.
He answers too fast.
He doesn't take time to think.
- OK. Thank you.
- He doesn't talk enough.
Yes?
OK.
- Are you of legal age? Minor?
Legal age.
- Do you have an ID to prove it?
A paper with your name?
- No, I have no papers.
I need an ID, Sir.
Something
which proves your identity.
If you please.
If you want to be done with it quickly,
put what you have
in your pockets on the table.
- I don't understand what you say.
- However, I do speak french.
I'm asking you
to empty your pockets
and lay it on the table.
- OK, I'll do it...
Thank you.
My phone...
... and my phone charger.
- This comes from us.
Ah yeah?
- Yes, Sir.
Really?
And since when?
You have been filmed in the store.
We saw you open the box,
throw it back on the shelf
and put this item in your pocket.
- Ah, OK.
- And the phone too?
- No. The phone,
it's yours.
Do you have an ID?
- No.
- No, Sir, leave this here.
What are you saying to me?
He is serious, him?
-Sir, please,
an ID?.
If you want things to go fast,
give me your papers, fill the form,
you pay, you leave
and it stops here.
I'm leaving, what?
To begin with,you took my charger.
- It is not your charger.
It comes from the store.
And the proof is where?
Calm down, please.
- You have been filmed.
- OK. Show me the evidence?
- The police will take care of this.
- Call them, I don't care !
- I'm asking politely
for an ID.
We will do things in a calm way.
Put your phone on the table,
and do what she says.
- Please, Sir,
It will go fast.
Give me an ID
so that I can fill this form.
I can take my time, you know.
No problem.
You want me to tell the truth?
- Please.
I took this charger.
It's true, I stole it.
- But you know why?
- No.
Because someone, 
outside the store, told me :
" Get in the store
and take a charger for me,
" Otherwise I kick your ass."
- OK, and where is this man?
He must be in front of the store.
He said that he would kick me,
so I took the charger.
Right now, you are 
putting me in trouble.
- Sir, please...
- I can't pay.
- Sir, we didn't put 
a knife under your throat...
Whatever, how do we do now?
Do you understand my situation?
Yes, but it is not our problem.
- Ah really?
In fact, you don't care!
A guy will kick my ass,
you don't care?
- Calm down.
Be polite.
Let's get over this quickly.
Give us an ID.
We fill the form, you pay,
and it's over.
No, Sir,
let's stay polite with each other.
- Be polite.
- Yeah, OK, whatever.
And how much is it,
this charger?
So fucking boring.
- Can you go get the box please?
Scan it, and bring me the ticket.
Here you are.
- By the way, I want the box.
- Sir, you have no order to give.
- You have nothing to ask.
- Sorry but I am a customer,
- so I'm the King.
The customer is King.
- You have not a customer yet,
and you are not a King here.
Madam, the customer is King or not?
- No, not for now.
- Please!
Please, I would like
a bit of silence.
You are together today.
You know why.
I will ask Gisele to come forward.
Here you are, my Gisele.
My great friend.
So Gisele,
now that you are about to retire,
We decided
to sing a little song to you.
I will ask my colleagues
to come along,
Wait...
If I don't have my eyes...
She sells black pudding,
Bacon, sausage
On pasta,
She always has an opinion
She doesn't count her hours,
She has such a huge heart
Behind her area,
she exudes happiness
If you make good accounts,
It's been more than thirty years
That you love your job
And you love your customers
Then look, look a little
We're here, Gisele, to say goodbye
Then look, look a little
You'll see people who love you,
and not only a little
It is soon the departure
for you
It's going to be weird
not to see you Gisele
The days and years
will slowly go by
But you can be sure
that we will not forget you
Then look, look a little
We're here, Gisele, to say goodbye
Then look, look a little
You'll see people who love you,
and not only a little
OK. I will say
a few words for Gisele.
Gisele,
whom I don't know 
as well as anyone here,
I would like to tell you
what I believe
everyone feels.
Gis√®le Gerwig,
there is no need to work with you
for very long to enjoy your presence.
I am here since 6 months today,
but I know that you know
much more than me about this store.
And you could
teach me a lot.
Always on time.
Always ready to give
a small hand.
Always smiling.
Always of good advice
for customers.
This is important.
Because that is our mission.
Service to the customer.
And you accepted this mission
for 32 years, Gis√®le.
32 years.
First a clerk, for 12 years,
and then the delicatessen area,
where you worked for 20 years.
Now, you're about to go,
but bear in mind,dear Gis√®le,
that we will always be happy
to welcome you here and say Hi,
And from the bottom of our hearts,
once again, thank you.
- This is OK.
- What do you do?
- You'll see.
Ready?
This.
Can I dance with you?
Come on, come.
Go, dance with your mother !
- Camera 22.
It's the tights area,
underwear...
Do you see anything suspicious?
- The bag of the Lady is open
and close to her hand,
so she can drop all
the products she wants inside.
They pretend to be interested
in a product
and then they slip it
in the bag.
You must understand
that the thief
has no age, has no color.
Everyone can steal.
Old people, young ones...
Look here.
You see, 
the item is still in her hand.
It's not in her cart still.
You have to be careful.
Now, it seems to be OK.
But while we watch here,
a lot of...
a lot of things happen
on the other screens...
truth is, you have about
80 cameras in the store.
You will get used to it.
You have some time to do so.
If you want to switch to another angle,
you just press the number of the camera.
There, I switch to the 32.
And you press CAM.
It's the one moving along the rail.
It allows you to control all the areas.
With the construction in the store,
we have zero visibility.
This is the wine area.
Ah, lovers...
Even couples may steal.
Camera 54
covers the video games area.
And the CDs. Must be careful.
Camera 35.
This one keeps the product
in his hands.
This is not normal.
You have to make sure
He doesn't open it later.
You see, it's still in his hands.
Great.
Camera 18,
Checkout.
In the cashiers area,
You zoom in to see 
if they scan all the items,
if they let a cart go by 
with items still inside,
It can happen.
Truth is, the Director wants to
increase turnover.
Given that there has not been much
departures in early retirement,
he tries to fire some staff.
So if there is a problem,
don't hesitate,
you warn the agent 
at the end of the cash register,
so he may make an arrest.
Give me the shower.
Give your hand.
- Thanks for coming.
- Thank you for receiving us.
- I wanted to
meet with you
so that we can talk about
the orientation of Matthieu.
The project of Matthieu
is a project
which is ambitious
but also is very realistic.
But if we need to meet today,
it's because at this moment,
There is a small drop in
the involvement of Matthieu,
a small decrease in results.
Which could, eventually,
if things do not get better soon,
compromise his orientation.
Let me be clear
about this,
I don't want to give
the feeling that the situation 
is very bad.
Matthieu had
a good first year,
good results.
That's why at the end
of this first year,
Matthieu was already talking
about biological engineering,
about the school, right?
It's a project you thought 
about a lot, it's very good.
Very well structured.
We validated it,
at the end of the first year,
as a coherent project.
However, the results
of the 1st quarter
are not
as good as they should be.
Let me remind you that it's a
demanding area, very selective.
For this 1st quarter,
it is a little below expectations.
What can you tell us,
Matthieu, about the situation?
I don't know,
maybe too much pressure,
Because, as I really want
to get into that school,
I put a lot of pressure to myself.
And then, also...
Unfortunately, I missed
the latest exam of biology.
I really missed it.
Because I learned that
there is another exam
Next week
and the teacher told me that
this one was important for the school
I worked, worked,
worked on it
- and unfortunately...
- Yes, well...
Now, your results are down a little,
so this is why it was important
for us to meet,
to discuss,
and for me to alert you.
So that at the 2nd quarter,
and we're sure of that,
we go back to the level
required to get in that school.
- Maybe you put
too much pressure on yourself
before the exams.
- Maybe.
At home, I have the feeling that...
He works.
He is at the level.
But often,
the note is not related
to the work he has done.
- It's necessary to focus,
you have to understand that
you can do it,
So keep working,
but stay focused.
You say :
"I work, I work, I work..."
So either this is not working very well,
or you have something else on your mind.
Whatever.
But the goal is the engineering school.
Here, Sir.
OK.
You know why you are here?
- Not at all.
You don't know why
you are here?
You forgot to pay for an item.
- No, they are here.
Yes Sir, you forgot
to pay for an item.
Which item?
- Ah, you know which one.
No, everything I have is here.
Please take out the item.
It's in your pocket.
- You have been filmed, Sir.
The item is not there,
It's on you.
Well, I took this...
- Will you go and scan this?
- But it's an accident...
- Yes,Yes.
Leave it there, Sir.
Do you have an ID?
I did that without thinking...
Is this address correct?
- Yes, it is.
Mr Dorval...
My colleague will come back
with the item, he's scanning it,
you will pay for it
and then it's over.
- But I can't...
I can't pay for it.
You don't have any money on you?
- Oh no...
Let me finish this.
- Is this correct?
- Yes.
I have to sign something?
- Yes, here.
Well, Sir...
You have any money on you?
- No. No.
No, this is all I have...
I had just enough to pay for
the items in my bag, but...
- At your home?
No, this is all I have left 
until the end of the month...
You have nothing at your home?
- No.
If you leave your ID here,
you can go back home...
and bring back the money...
- No...
- Please step aside Sir.
15,75 euros.
But I don't...
- This gentleman can't pay.
I can't pay.
- I proposed him to go home...
Can't you put it back..
... in the store?
- Impossible, it's a fresh product.
- Yes, I'm here?
Do you have a relative 
who could help you?
No.
- A friend?
- No...
No, I don't have anyone...
- We have to call the police then.
- This is the first time
It happens to me...
No, I never did...
It never happened.
- If you pay, it's over now.
- I can pay you later,
but now, I have no money.
- Then it's the police.
Call them then.
We can't find a way?
- No, Sir.
I'm telling you,
You pay and it's over.
It is the easiest way.
- If I could pay,
I would...
It's not like I don't want to...
If I could, I would.
- Do you have your employment contract?
- Yes.
- I'll take it.
- Here it is.
- Thank you.
All right.
The trial period is over...
This is what you told me...
OK, this is perfect.
I keep it for now, I will make
photocopies later on.
So you want to take 
a credit of 2000 euros?
Yes.
- You found
a used car in a good shape?
Yes, I think so.
- I'm asking
because I can propose you
a credit up to 3500 euros.
- No, no.
- So 2000 euros over 3 years...
Including insurance, you will 
pay back 60 euros a month.
Is it OK?
- Yes, very good.
- You like your new job?
- Yes, it's OK.
- How does it go?
- Very well.
- You can go back 
to your position, Samuel.
- Well, what's happening?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- No.
- Mrs. Anselmi,
you picked up
discount tickets?
- No, I threw them away,
as usual.
No, Mrs. Anselmi,
you didn't.
You have picked them up.
No, I tossed them in my dustbin,
under the cash register.
- Thierry, please ask Samuel to check
what's in Mrs. Anselmi's trash.
Thierry for Samuel?
- Listening, Thierry.
Can you can go check in
the dustbin of Fran√ßoise
If there is any discount coupons?
- OK, I'm going.
- Good.
- Samuel for Thierry?
Yes.
- I saw nothing...
I saw nothing in the trash.
Thank you.
- So where are these coupons?
I have them with me.
I confess.
They are here.
But I swear,
This is the first time.
- It's not the first time,
you have been filmed.
Jean-Eddy, do you confirm?
- Yes, Sir.
Thierry, you confirm?
- Yes.
- It's not the first time,
Mrs. Anselmi.
How come?
You know that it's forbidden.
- Yes I know.
I know perfectly
that it's prohibited.
- Then?
You know me
Since a long time.
I am serious in my work.
- It's stealing.
- I know...
- It's theft.
You are not stealing the store.
You are stealing Thierry's bonus,
Jean-Eddy's bonus,
all your colleagues bonus.
Are you aware of that?
- Yes.
Yes.
- Then?
- We can find a way.
- Honestly,
I don't think so.
What way?
What can I do?
You have an idea?
- You can give my bonus away.
You cancel my bonus.
- And what will they say,
your colleagues?
What will they think?
They will think they can pick up
discount coupons,
and keep their jobs, relax.
I have explained to you.
You know how serious I am.
We can find a way.
The problem we have now
 between us, Mrs. Anselmi,
Is the trust.
There is no more trust.
I can not work
with people
I don't trust.
I trust you.
- But I don't.
I don't.
I did.
But it's over, now.
No, not now.
- Can you close the door?
Good evening.
Thank you for coming to this meeting,
which I would rather not do,
very sincerely.
Something happened.
Something quite exceptional
for all of us.
For me as well.
And I asked the
human resources Director
to join me today,
because I would us to talk
about what happened.
And if possible,
we will answer your questions.
Here is Mr. Draux.
I'll let him introduce himself.
Hello everyone.
I am Mr. Draux, Director
of the human resources for the group.
I'm here at the request of Mr. Ouhib
and direction of the group.
I'll go straight to the point.
What happened?
One of your colleagues,
Mrs. Anselmi,
commited suicide here
in your workplace.
Mr. Ouhib stated that it was...
a person who was here
since more than 20 years.
You certainly knew her, all of you.
She was appreciated
by yourselves, by the customers...
She was a good worker.
Some of you may have been 
close to her,
You may have taken
a coffee with her, a meal.
Maybe you met with her
outside of work.
But it doesn't mean 
you really knew her.
Please listen to what I'm going to say.
Nobody here should feel guilty
for what happened.
OK, she took her own life here,
at her workplace,
after leaving the group,
but the life of Mrs. Anselmi
was not limited to her work.
Life is a lot of things.
She had a family.
She had a son,
brothers, sisters, friends...
She had joy, sorrow,
projects, disappointments.
Her job,
it was a part of her life,
but there are a lot of things around.
When your door is closed,
Nobody knows
what's happening behind.
Just now, we just learn with Mr. Ouhib
that Mrs. Anselmi had a son
who is addicted to drugs.
This is something
that is very, very heavy.
She had
big financial problems
because she was taking care of him.
So as you can see...
a lot of things
can explain her gesture,
but only she knows
the actual reasons.
Only her.
Nobody here should feel
responsible for anything.
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I will now ask you to stand up.
- In the name of the father,
the son and the Holy Spirit.
The Lord be with you.
- You take it, that one?
- Well, Yes.
Can you go behind, please?
Sit down behind.
You got your smart card on you?
- No.
No? You're sure?
- Yes.
You know why we're here,
anyway. You can guess.
No?
- No, I don't know.
I won't beat around the bush.
I saw you using
your fidelity card at the register
while you had customers
who didn't have theirs.
And with this card,
you got points.
Here you go.
- It's not possible, I have no card.
- No, don't tell me that.
I saw you myself.
Thierry saw you
through the video.
We have all the evidence.
You know very well
how it goes.
You know very well what it's called.
You know or you don't?
Give me your smart card,
please.
It's in my locker.
You are not making my life easy.
- Give us your card,
it's easier.
- Why did you do that?
I don't understand you.
- Points were multiplied by 10.
- Oh yeah?
Now, it's your problems
which will be multiplied by 10.
So I will now go check your card,
we'll see how many times
you used it,
and then after, we'll check
with the direction.
It's just some points,
I didn't steal anything.
I have to control.
- You are not going to tell
the direction for a fidelity card?
I don't know.
