- Hello.
- Hello, Uncle George.
- Doesn't she look well?
- She always looks good.
All right, old chap,
you've made your point.
Lovely to see you!
We haven't moved anything.
Mind the arch.
Yes, I remember.
Damn!
There goes my grand entrance.
Oh, Sarah.
- What was it?
- Did I break it?
- Of course not.
- It wouldn't matter if you had.
- Where is it?
- This goes on the newel post?
- Yes, that's right.
- It's the one thing that is new. I forgot.
- It's all right.
Now I know where it is.
You'll find everything the same
up here.
Now...
...nothing has been touched
in your room.
But Sandy is going
to be sharing with you.
- Just for the first few days.
- Okay.
Well, here we are.
Dinner was wonderful.
Well, just pot luck, I'm afraid.
I've been rather disorganised today.
I wish you'd disorganised
that hospital a bit.
- Was the food that awful?
- I didn't eat for five weeks.
I remember when
I was in the hospital...
Sarah, is there anything else
you'd like, dear?
You know what I'd like? A nice glass
of port to put me off to sleep.
- It's on its way.
- No, I'll get it.
- Let's see if I can find the right bottle.
Yes, of course.
As I was saying, when
I had my appendix out...
We don't want to hear
that revolting story again!
It isn't that one.
It's the one about the food.
Sarah, that's the whisky, dear.
Oh, you're right.
Got it.
Right, well, I'll go into the kitchen
and help Sandy with the dishes.
- Shall I pour it for you?
- It's okay.
If you don't mind my playing blind
man's buff with your vintage port.
Not at all. Help yourself.
Anyhow, if I spill any,
it'll match the carpet.
Oh, I've just remembered.
As I was leaving for the station,
Steve rang.
Did he?
Well, I guess it's a bit late
to call him right now.
I don't think he'd mind.
Still, I don't feel quite up to it tonight.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- There you are.
- Thank you.
Tired?
Well, I did find it rather a strain today.
I can imagine.
I think the hardest part is not rushing
to help her every minute.
Well, that's exactly what she wants:
no fuss.
The best thing is to let her
find her own way,
and just not pay her
too much attention.
She's very determined
to manage herself.
She's certainly your sister's daughter.
I know. She is the same as she was.
A whim of iron.
You don't mind me sharing, do you?
Why should I mind?
Only, er...
Mother thought it would be
a good idea until you...
Well, until you get used
to things again.
I know. She's right.
You will be a help, Sandy.
- Sarah.
- Mmm?
What's it like?
Bloody awful.
- Good night, Sarah.
- Night.
- Good night.
- Night.
Now, who would do that?
GEORGE". Spoiling things for
the sake of spoiling them.
It might have been an accident.
GEORGE". It's envy.
They're not prepared to work so that
they can own something worthwhile.
They can't bear the existence
of other people who will.
Darling, you'll get it repaired.
Will you please stop going on about it?
If it had been an accident,
I wouldn't mind. Accidents happen.
But this is so bloody nasty.
I just wish I could do something.
- The insurance will pay for it.
- That's not the point.
What happened?
Somebody scratched the car. You'd
think the world was coming to an end.
They did it deliberately,
that's what I can't get over.
Badly scratched?
The whole of the front end.
You should see...
- You can probably imagine what it's like.
- Life is going to get difficult
if you keep trying to eliminate
the verb "to see" from your vocabulary.
Yes, I suppose it is. I'm sorry.
It's a shame about the car.
Sarah. A bit further to your left.
You're heading for the cellar door.
Oh!
Right. Thank you.
Honestly, did you ever
hear such a fuss?
Oh, you know what men are like
with their cars.
You're late.
- Yeah. I missed the bus.
- Catch up, then. There's a good chap.
Fix the mower,
then get on with the lawns.
Yeah.
Who is it?
You don't know me, but I know you.
I heard about you.
The name is Barker.
- I've been got in to help your uncle.
- How do you do?
They shot him, didn't they?
The horse.
What do they want to shoot
the poor creature for?
They had to.
He broke his leg when we fell.
That's what they say.
Sarah! Sarah!
Telephone. It's Steve.
Here we are.
- It's okay. You're alone.
- Thank you.
Steve?
Welcome home.
I've been waiting for you to call me.
Well, I only arrived last night.
How are things going?
Oh, still finding my way about,
falling over the furniture.
I thought I'd pick you up tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes. I've got some new horses
I'd like you to meet.
- All right. That will be lovely.
- Okay.
- I'll be over sometime after lunch.
- Right.
- See you tomorrow, then.
- Fine. Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
We may not be here
when you get back.
We promised to go over to the Fenners'.
You know how the Fenners drag on.
- Of course.
- Steve's car is coming up the drive.
I'd better go.
I'll take that.
- Ciao.
- Bye-bye, dear. Will you be late back?
I don't know.
- Well, Sandy will be here.
- Right. Slow down.
Uncle George, bye-bye.
- Enjoy yourself.
- Thanks.
Sarah, could you manage here
on your own?
I mean, if you got back
and I wasn't here,
could you manage by yourself
for a while?
- Who is he?
- Someone I met in town the other day.
- I promised to meet him. You mind?
- Of course not.
- Are you sure you'll be all right?
- I'll be all right.
Steve.
No, miss. We've got a mare
in foal, so Mr Reding sent me.
- He said to apologise.
- Oh, I see.
This way.
Careful! Mind your head getting in.
- Sarah, thanks.
- Okay.
Come on.
Wait. Come on.
Hold it.
Come on. Come on.
- What was that?
- Diddicoys.
Diddicoys. Gippos. Gypsies.
- Don't know why they allow 'em.
- They don't do much harm, surely?
No.
And they don't do
much good neither.
Jacko...
Sarah!
Hello.
Hello!
- You look marvellous!
- Thank you.
Come on, let's go to the house.
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.
How are you, Sarah?
Well, I'm fine, actually.
Your foal. It's a bad time
of year for a foal, isn't it?
Yeah. Yes, it is.
- It'll probably never survive the winter.
- No, not a chance.
When the poor mare gets pregnant,
they hand it to me,
and expect me to work miracles.
I should have refused, I suppose,
but they're such good customers.
Look, Sarah,
you know I wanted to visit you.
Yes, I know.
I suppose you had your reasons.
Yeah, I did.
Can't you tell me about them?
It is important to me, you know.
- Yes. What is it?
- It's the mare, Mr Reding.
- Do you want to come along?
- Of course!
Mind the step.
Hey, it's over.
How are they?
Oh, they're all right for now.
Isn't there anything you can do
to save the foal?
Oh, there's lots to be done,
and it'll be done,
but I don't hold out
much hope for it.
Hey!
- Hello. He's friendly.
- Yes, he is.
He's one of the new ones.
He's got plenty of spirit.
- What colour is he?
- He's chestnut.
He's your kind of horse.
Can I ride him?
- Of course.
- I mean, now.
Sure. Why not?
Oh!
George.
Don't you think you should
be getting ready?
Please hurry, darling.
Remember the traffic last time.
I'll climb in and out of the bath.
Ready in half an hour.
Sandy, do you want some tea
before we go?
No, thanks.
I'm going to play some records.
I'm not as brave as I thought I was.
You don't have to be.
Come on, let's get on with it.
Give me your leg.
- Okay?
- Yeah, so far.
All right. I'll take your reins
and we'll go on a little walk.
Just relax and see how it goes.
Come on.
How do you feel now?
A lot braver.
- We're in the upper field, right?
- Right.
- And the old oak tree is over there?
- Right again.
Give me the reins.
- Let me see if I can find it.
- All right.
- Betty?
- All right, I'll get it.
I'd forgotten how lovely it is up here.
I shall miss it.
What do you mean?
I'm only here for a few days. I'm going to
London next week on a training course.
Training? What for?
I'm not rich, you know.
I have to work to support myself.
- Yes, but what's the training for?
- Oh, physiotherapy.
There's quite a lot
of blind physiotherapists.
And I'd be doing something useful.
Does that mean
you'll be staying in London?
Well, I have friends looking
for a flat for me now.
I wish you wouldn't, Sarah.
I mean, I thought we might
pick up where we left off.
Things aren't quite the same, are they?
No, they're not.
It's not just today. It's something
you'd be burdened with forever.
Don't go, Sarah.
No, they'll all be out by now.
So you'll be here on your own?
I'll be all right.
Anyway, I'm not alone.
There's a gardener around somewhere.
Well, I don't know. I think I'll stay.
I'm on my home ground now.
- All right, I'll stop fussing.
- Okay.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Barker!
Barker, I'm making some coffee.
Do you want some?
Barker?
- Who is it?
- It's me, Steve.
Get yourself dressed
and come down here.
Steve, it's only seven o'clock!
I was just running a bath.
Leave it. I'll take you as you are.
I've got a surprise.
Okay.
Sandy?
- Steve!
- Good morning.
I had to creep out.
They're all still asleep.
Late night?
They must have had.
I didn't even hear them come in.
Come with me.
What? Where are you taking me?
Never mind.
I've got a surprise for you.
- I forgot it was your birthday.
- My birthday? That was ages ago!
I know. All the more reason.
- Almost there.
- What?
- All right?
- Yes.
Turn around.
I was going to wrap him up,
but I ran out of pink ribbon.
Oh, Steve!
Steve!
Happy birthday.
Can I ride him?
Whatever you want. He's yours now.
Yeah.
- Leg up!
- Right.
His name? I don't know his name.
Dandy Star.
Dandy?
You can change it if you want.
Dandy.
Dandy Star.
Okay, we're here.
All right.
- Here, let me do that.
- Okay. Thank you.
Come on, round here. That's it.
- Steve?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
It was all done
for an ulterior motive anyway.
- What?
- You've got responsibilities here now.
You can't just leave him
and go off to London, can you?
Hmm. See what you mean.
- I'll come over later and bed him down.
- No, I'd like to do it myself.
If I can't manage, Uncle George
or Sandy can help me.
Okay, good. Come on.
I've got to go now.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Isn't it time these people got up?
- Oh, let them sleep it off.
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye.
Bye.
Hello?
Oh.
Hello! Anyone up yet?
Aunt Betty?
Sandy?
Sandy!
Sandy!
No!
Aunt Betty!
Aunt Betty!
Help me. Please, help me.
It's Barker.
Barker.
What happened?
What happened?
Heard a shot.
I started to run towards the house.
There was a man in the doorway.
The kitchen doorway.
I saw the gun go up.
I kept passing out.
I'll go get help.
Corning back.
He... he left something behind.
Coming back for it.
What? What's he left?
Silver bracelet.
On the floor, over there.
Where?
Where?
Right ahead of you.
- Where?!
'Keep going.
Keep going.
I can't find it!
In front of you, to the right.
I found it! Barker!
It's got writing on it.
Engraving.
What does it say?
Barker?
Barker!
Easy, boy.
Home, boy, home.
Dandy!
Dandy!
He"? me!
He"? me!
He"? me!
Please!
Please!
What's the matter?
Come on, dear.
Come on.
That's better. Better if you cry.
Get it all out if you cry.
Now, darling.
Now, that's all right, lovely.
No one's gonna harm you.
Come, darling, drink this.
Come on, you drink it.
Now, now, now, now, now.
Shhh.
It's all better. It's all gone.
Shhhhhh.
Where? Which house?
Manor Farm.
Here, that's the place where Jack...
You don't know who this bloke was?
You heard him,
but you don't know who he was?
Wait.
His?
I don't know. I think so.
There's writing on it, a name.
- What does it say?
- There ain't no name on it.
No, there's writing on it.
What does it say?
It's blank! I'm taking you to the police.
Two steps.
Now slide across.
Tom.
Don't worry, Mother.
I'll take care of everything.
What's happened?
He must have slipped his halter.
I suppose so.
Let's have a look at him.
There's some blood over here.
There's no cut.
No.
Call the Rextons and tell them
I'm coming. You two come with me.
- Max, take care of the horse.
- Right, sir.
Come on, we're here.
Where is this?
Where are you taking me?
- Never you mind.
- Wait! No, don't. No, don't!
Get in there!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Let's go and check the house.
In here, governor.
That bloody fool! I told him
to stay away from there!
- He went there last night but wouldn't...
- I've got to find him!
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
Roll everything up. We're moving out.
Right, son.
A maniac's on the loose. I'll drop
you at the phone down the road.
Get the police up here.
We'll look for Sarah.
Help! Anybody, help!
Help, anybody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Wait a minute, governor.
Switch off the engine a minute.
I thought I heard something.
No, I guess not.
Hang on, governor. There!
You're right.
It's over by the old clay pit.
Sarah!
It's all right.
You'll soon feel more relaxed.
Just rest.
Complete rest and quiet.
Thank you.
I'll look in and see you this evening.
Right.
Would you like something
to help you sleep?
No, thank you.
All right. Goodbye. See you later.
Goodbye. Thank you, doctor.
Oh, doctor...
...would it be all right
if I had a bath?
Oh, yes, but keep
the pressure off your foot.
Okay.
Jack, get in here!
- Yeah, but...
- Come here!
Yeah, well, I'll see you, all right?
Go on. Go on, Jack,
off with your big brother.
What's up, Tom?
Where are you going?
To the house?
The police are taking care of that.
I'll leave someone with you.
- Where are you going?
- I'll see you later.
Steve!
We're looking for a gypsy.
A gippo?
Is that all she said, a gippo?
Well, there's a camp
down Hulcote Wood.
Yes, it'll be quicker to go
cross country. We'll take the horses.
No, not you. You stay here
and make sure she's all right.
Come on!
- Please.
- You went to the house!
- No, Tom, listen to me.
- You went up to the house!
All right, I went up there! I went there!
And you left this! You stupid,
murdering bungler, you left this!
But it isn't mine.
Listen, I gave mine to the girl.
It's the truth!
Listen t0 me. Please, listen.
You've gotta listen!
No! No, look, it's a mistake!
It's a mistake!
Look, he thought it was me. He thought
I did it because lwent up to the house!
I went to the house because
I had a date with Sandy.
She didn't turn up,
so I went to see why.
When I got there, I couldn't make
nobody hear. The house was empty!
He thought it was him.
His name's Jack, the same.
Yeah, but it's not mine!
I keep telling you, it's not mine!
I gave mine to the girl, to Sandy!
Oh, it's not mine, I swear it!
Well, they ain't gonna believe
a gippo, are they?
This says "Jacko".
It's all right.
It's all right, Sarah.
It's all right in here.
It's all right.
