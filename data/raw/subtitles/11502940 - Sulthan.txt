-Hey, check out for him!
-Bhai, he's out here.
-Please, spare me.
-Get hold of him.
-Bhai, please don't do it.
It wasn't me.
-The issue is between us.
-Why did you drag that family
in to it?
-Bhai, please, let go of me.
-Sethupathi, sir, has spoken!
-Die, damn it!
-Demons! I've mentioned million times
not to indulge in violence.
Blood stained hands.
And the house stinks of blood.
Everyone of you have lost your minds.
I've smeared the place with
turmeric and sandalwood...
still the blood stink makes me nauseous.
Come on, serve!
Yadagiri, what took you so long?
The hunger is killing us.
I'm not hungry.
Sister, served me sumptuous food.
Sister, please bring us some gravy.
The hunger is killing us!
All you guys can talk about
is killing...
there's nothing else that matters
to you people.
Sister, please serve us some gravy.
You guys comes to me for food.
But never pay heed to my concerns.
Serve them well. Once they've eaten...
let them get back to killing people.
Hey, old hag, I'm going to kill you soon.
You've been ranting the same
for 10 years.
They're never going to reform.
Who are we to take ones' life?
With God's grace,
we have everything we need.
Our child is on the way.
They're all here.
It's more than enough.
Let's stop the rowdyism.
Just serve the gravy!
If you don't put an end to it.
Your sins will catch up to your son.
When his uncles are alive,
no one can dare touch him.
We'll teach him everything
related to combat...
and turn him into
an one man army!
Bloody sinners.
Shut up your dirty mouths.
-Don't get sister all worked up!
Unlike you people,
he'll never kill anyone.
He's my son.
People who trust him...
also people who come looking
for his help
he'll fulfill it with his life.
Dear, you may be just saying it.
Just like, Abhimanyu from Mahabharatha...
he's listening to every word we speak
inside your womb.
He'll listen to everything, and say to us
"Better listen to my mother..."
he'll skin us all to abide by your ideals.
-Oh, my God!
Wake up everyone!
Hey!
Sir!
Let's go!
Sir, you be with her.
We'll handle them.
Let's go!
Oh, God!
Please bear with me, dear.
-Baby's head is stuck in the
umbilical cord.
Dear, please bear with me.
-Just bear with me, dear.
It's a boy!
My, son!
We couldn't save the mother, sir.
He is born on an auspicious day.
You guys raise him well.
He'll raise you people in return.
"People who trust him...
also people who come looking
for his help
he'll fulfill it with his life."
"Sulthan"
Sir, please spare me.
A
A B C
-F.
-F.
-G.
-G.
Say it!
I'll say it, Sulthan!
-Sethupathi's men are feared
by the people of Vizag city.
Sir, many officers before you have
tried to bring down Sethupathi.
Sethupathi and his men
are extremely dangerous.
-There's nothing we can do about it.
Sulthan is about to arrive,
and no one seems to care.
Bloody buffaloes,
Sulthan, might arrive anytime.
Take bath get ready soon.
Are they truly playing
or just pretending to play?
I can't hear anything.
Hey, stop playing!
I said, stop it.
Bloody, King-Kong.
I can't hear anything, damn it.
Ask them play hard,
so that my ears should thrum!
Damn it, your ears are already
thrummed!
Sulthan is about to arrive
and you're being a nuisance.
Get to work people.
Sulthan, might be here anytime.
Sulthan is on his way. Not sure,
how long he'll stay this time.
Get everything in--
Yeah, I got it!
-What is it?
-Sir...
Sir, is hosting food drive right...
-they're here check what will be served.
-No, we are not.
-Then?
-We're here too meet, sir.
Oh, come along.
We want one person killed.
Kill? Who?
Jayaendra!
Our livelihood depends on agriculture.
Four years ago,
he offered money to buy our land.
We refused to sell him our land.
In the name of agriculture,
I asked you not to get into the field
also I asked you not to plow the land.
Looks like folks of this village
don't understand the meaning of it.
You're ready to sacrifice your lives...
but will never sell your lands, is it?
People who disobeyed his orders...
he not only killed the humans
but the animals too.
Hereafter, no one in this village
should dare think of doing agriculture.
If they're still persistent,
then it'll be their death.
Death, it is!
Sir, the best we could offer.
Wedding chains of our women folk
and our hard earned money.
Please take this,
kill him and bury him into the ground.
We reached out to politicians
and officials for the help.
But no one cared to help.
Many from the village have migrated
and working minimum wage.
-Only when he's dead...
agriculture will come back to life
in our village.
-The entire village is waiting
for your arrival.
I have no idea about his power.
But I'll definitely save your people
and your lands.
Agriculture will once again bloom
in your village.
It's a promise!
In return,
all I need is just one fist full of paddy.
That's enough!
Thanks a lot, sir.
We're happy!
Hey, Sulthan has landed.
Quickly finish the work.
-We're almost done!
It's a village nearby, Amravati.
Not sure who is that person.
Is it important for us
to get involved?
It's very important, Mansoor.
We've committed too many sins.
God gives us one opportunity to do
some good through people like them.
Let's try to lessen our sins.
I've given my word.
It's imperative that I fulfill it.
Sulthan has arrived!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Sulthan!
-Hey, King-Kong!
How are you?
My state is like a calf stuck among the
herd of buffaloes.
Not a day goes by without
getting kicked by them.
-Vikram, how are you?
-Kasi, I'm good.
At least,
you called me by my name.
I'll catch you later!
Hey, how dare you call,
Sulthan by his name?
Isn't that his name?
Uncle!
-Kaali, how are you?
-I'm good Sulthan.
-Hey, Don, how are you?
-I'm good!
-Giri, how are you?
-I'm good, Sulthan.
-Uncle.
-Meet your father.
-Dad.
-Hey, stay blessed, son.
-How are you, dad?
-I'm doing well, dear.
-How are you?
-I'm doing good too.
Buddy, who are these hillbillies?
-Make way.
-Hey, put me down.
Is he truly your friend?
He's my friend, put him down.
-Who was hiding?
-You!
I didn't!
I got a little scared.
So, he's the Godfather, is it?
Namaste, father.
Hope you're doing well.
You returned after two years.
How long will you stay this time?
Oh, that's a person.
I thought it's a flower pot.
-One full week!
-Sulthan, is going to stay for a week!

-They're applauding as if they
understood it.
Look, it's tending to everything
like Rajinikanth from Robot.
I think human race is in danger.
You're right, buddy!
Sulthan, the robots were great.
-Thank you, everyone.
-That's awesome, Sulthan.
Dad, I'm planning to go to Japan
to develop this project.
Once the partnership is successful...
I'll apply for a loan
and start the company.
Sulthan, then give us 100 rowdy robots
to work for us.
They'll handle all the violence.
That'll take some load of us.
-Is it okay, if you lose your job?
-Oh, no!
Let them stay where they are.
I feel very proud of you, son.
Chief, we raised him.
But you're taking credit for it.
I won't be coming home,
until Sulthan is here.
Hang up the phone!
Buddy, the pizza we ordered is here.
Check once, before you pay them.
We wouldn't know if they've delivered
the right order.
Your mother wanted you to be successful.
But she's--
Chief!
Hey!
Dad!
Sulthan!
-Get hold of them?
-Hey, don't let them escape.
Sir, please get up. Be careful
Hold him!
Dad!
Hey, take him inside.
You guys check out back.
Hey, don't let them escape.
-Hey, stop with the nonsense.
I should've been there.
-Show me your hand.
Hey, find out who were the shooters.
They should die.
Mother, please don't cry.
Don't worry,
nothing will happen to brother.
Sir!
Mother, don't do it.
-Don't stop me.
-Mother, hear me out.
I hope you're not hurt and are fine.
I checked with the doctor...
it'll take 4 days to say
if he'd wake up or not.
Where's your father?
Call and ask him to come.
Ask him to come down and
ask my son to indulge in violence.
No matter what state he's in,
he'll definitely wake up.
Sharadha, ma'am.
Do you think, your father will indulge
you in violence?
Will he ever ask you to hack
someone to death?
He raised you safe and sound...
but he doesn't care about the children
of the others.
He's making a fortune for your future.
Your father is not earning wealth
for your future.
But burdening you with sins.
But we don't want to be
part of those sins.
Please save my son from death.
We'll go far away and make our living.
I want my son back.
Chief, we inquired at the pizzeria...
they were not their delivery boys.
But whoever sent them
lives in this city.
We'll find them.
Mansoor, that's not the issue at hand.
This shouldn't have happened
in Sulthan's presence.
He's exactly like his mother, Mahalakshmi.
Exactly!
Son, I thought you were here for a week.
But looks like you're leaving.
Did your girlfriend happened to call?
You live in Bombay,
having a girlfriend is quite common.
This toe-ring was my gift
to your mom.
She's the only person I bowed down to.
No one can speak up to her.
She was the Queen who ruled us all.
If you happen to meet someone
like your mother...
give this to her.
It's fine if you don't have a girlfriend.
I can find you a good match,
we can move things forward.
Dad, how can you be so negligent?
All this blood has numbed your emotions.
Many are injured and admitted
at the hospital.
There's a man who's struggling
for his life.
But you're more interested in finding
a match for your son.
Step out of your world,
there are many who've been cursing you.
All your sins will haunt me forever.
My life and education came out of
this blood-money.
When I think about it,
I'm angry at myself.
I'm ashamed!
Dad, I beg of you. For God sake,
put an end to this violent life.
Send everyone back home.
At least they'll be alive.
Even if I explain,
you wouldn't understand.
We grew up in such circumstances.
We can neither stop or change
our way of living.
Only a handful have families
to go back to.
For many this is their only home.
And this is their family.
If you're my biological son,
they're my foster children.
You can't deprive them of it.
Then why was only I sent to Bombay?
Why did only I get to
pursue education?
There are many in the gang
who are of my age.
If you had considered them as your child,
they would've led a decent life too.
Sharadha, ma'am,
questioned me at the hospital.
"If your father will indulge you
in violence?"
The look in her eyes will haunt me forever.
I'm leaving town, tomorrow.
I won't return.
Son!
To date, I've never asked anyone
for anything.
I'm asking you as a father...
You're free to go as per your will.
But make sure you get back to
your roots at the end.
Don't neglect them,
'cause their rowdies and hooligans.
They'll give up their lives,
chanting your name, Sulthan!
If they happen to run into some trouble...
stand by them.
That's enough.
What is it, uncle?
Sulthan!
The shooters from the other night...
are policemen.
That's right, it was ordered by
the new Commissioner, Mahendra Reddy.
Yes, sir. Your father was the target.
But now, the order is out to encounter
all the big-wigs from your gang.
They've planned to execute this
within 10 days.
Mallesham.
Rocky.
Arunachalam.
Sampu.
Sambasivam.
Yadagiri.
Kasi.
Michael.
Mansoor.
No one from this list should
succeed Sethupathi.
Encounter them all.
I want my city clean!
Encounter? I don't think so.
I heard it was a gang-war.
No one in this city has the courage
to take down, Sethupathi.
I know it was the police,
that attacked.
Hey, I told you not to keep a low profile
until Sulthan is out here.
What's the hurry, damn it?
There are enough problems, already.
You live in Mumbai.
You have nothing to do with them.
Stay away from it.
Get lost!
It's for your own good.
Don't stay back. Leave from here.
What are you going to do,
after I leave?
Are you going to kill them all?
How many will you shoot?
10? 20?
Then?
You're well aware what'll happen
if they learn the truth.
They don't see a difference between
a constable and a commissioner.
Are you threatening me?
Are you planning to take
after your father?
No, sir!
I'm asking you for an opportunity.
You want to destroy them.
Whereas, I want to reform them.
Are you kidding?
It's impossible to reform them.
Every week 100's of cases are filed
against them.
How will you change them?
Violence runs in their blood.
Violence doesn't run in their blood.
In fact, it's in their brain.
We've excelled
to develop and command robots.
I was raised by them.
I'm sure they'll hear me out.
My father is one of the reasons,
why they've turned into criminals.
That's why I wanted to change it.
Give me an opportunity.
Have you read, Mahabharatham?
In Mahabharatham, Krishnan...
presented Kauravas with many opportunities,
but couldn't change their intentions.
So, Krishnan himself killed Kauravas.
You're just requesting for one opportunity.
I'll grant it.
I'll give you six months time.
But during these 6 months...
not even a single petty case should be
filed against them.
No complaint should be lodged
in any of the police station.
Is it possible?
Keep this in mind,
if something goes wrong...
nobody can save them.
In Mahabharatham,
Krishnan supported, Pandavas.
What if, Krishnan, had supported
the Kauravas?
I'm going to stand by them.
Why don't you read through Mahabharatham
once again excluding war?
Hello!
We're calling from Velagapudi.
When will you come over?
-We're losing lives by the day.
Hey, 20 of our men head to that village.
-Village?
-Okay, sir.
Have you gone mad?
We still don't know who attacked us.
Instead of looking for them,
you're sending men to the village.
It's suits right, "A gang without a leader,
is as good as a headless body."
Hey, Kasi, mind your words!
Choose your words carefully, mate!
Now, I'm saying,
no one should go to the village!
Fine, let's fight it out to
arrive at a decision.
Come on, damn it!
-Hey, stop the fight.
Why did you stop?
-Go ahead and fight.
-Son, don't mistake us.
Fight among yourselves
and then go on a killing spree.
It's just 3 days since he died.
You people are inhuman.
How are you able to sleep at peace?
The blood doesn't haunt you?
I came home with such joy!
But now I regret coming home.
Get this into your heads.
If I see any of you indulging in
any kind of violence...
then I'll break all ties with you people.
I will never come back,
neither I'll see your faces.
Make way!
You're not coming to Japan?
Have you gone mad?
Dude, this is your dream.
And you've worked hard for it.
They're no one, but a herd of rowdies.
Put them aside and let's leave for Japan.
To you they're are rowdies.
But they're everything for me.
I was fed by them.
I've slept on their laps.
Today, if I don't stand by them...
when I return...
I'll have no family to come back to.
You better leave. I'm not coming.
Hey!
We have to go to that village.
That was our chief's last promise
made to them.
We can't evade that promise.
I'll handle, Sulthan.
He doesn't have to know.
As per our plan,
20 of our men set out to that village.
We shouldn't miss the target.
He has to die!
Hey, until we go past the gate...
no one should make a noise
out of fear.
Pin-drop-silence!
Who made that sound?
Idiot, that was you.
Shut up and keep walking.
Hey!
-Instead of opening the gate,
why is everyone turning around?
-Oh, no, he's up.
-Where are you guys headed?
Can't you hear me?
We thought of taking a night stroll.
Why do you need a bag for a stroll?
Junga, had requested to buy
biscuits and chocolates for him.
No, Sulthan.
-The Hulk got us pinned.
-You guys are up to something fishy.
Listen, we were headed to
find a match for me.
-You could've said the truth, instead.
-Get lost!
-To find a match?
-Yes!
-And you expect me to believe it?
-Yes.
Tell me the truth.
Damn, I have to come up
with another lie.
Okay, I'll tell you.
Last week, I had gone to the market
to get radish.
While I was returning,
someone tapped on my shoulder.
When I turned around to look,
it was my aunt.
I hugged my aunt and...
we both kept crying.
The entire market was looking at us.
Did I hit a wall?
Lie!
Fine, is this how you repay me
for feeding you?
-Why did you stop?
-Shut up, damn it!
Nothing, Junga's shoe-lace got stuck.
Bloody reaper!
After that my aunt said one thing
with teary eyes...
"Hey King-Kong, my daughter
is meant to get married to you...
she's been waiting for you
all her life
somehow you make sure to
get married to her."
My hands were tied with love.
I didn't want to disappoint them...
I wanted to go beyond your control
to find a match
and then come to meet you.
It was suggested by this shorty-pants.
Really?
Something doesn't add up.
I know. I'm well aware
what doesn't add up.
I ran away from home
during childhood...
how did my aunt manage
to find me?
Since childhood,
my hairstyle hasn't changed.
-That wasn't my doubt, King-Kong.
-What else?
We named you "King-Kong".
I wonder how you aunt cried
calling out "King-Kong."
-Sulthan, he's laughing.
-Hey, I'm crying, damn it.
Sulthan, you don't seem to appreciate
the truth I told.
Instead, you've been finding loopholes
in my story.
If you don't believe,
I'll fall on your feet.
I'm telling the truth.
-Sulthan!
-I'm really hurt--
Hey, I've managed the situation,
don't come!
-Son, it was me who asked them--
-Bhai!
I've explained everything to him.
We're headed to find a match for me.
Please don't mess up our plan.
Have you gone mad?
What do you expect?
The door was open and they were here.
Junga, brought him out.
Don't feed him anymore.
"No one should remain in Vizag
for the next 6 months."
"Take them far away from
any kind of trouble."
He's thinking hard. If our lie is caught,
then he'll skin us alive.
I deserve a bonus for handling
the situation.
Okay, I'll come along
to find a match for you.
You're coming? Bhai, help me.
Sulthan, he might not attend
his own wedding.
Why should you go?
Why shouldn't I?
This will be the first auspicious event
after father's demise.
What's the head-count at our house?
There are 94 people in our house.
-Including, Junga, it'll be 110.
-Right!
All of us are going to find
a match for him.
Listen everyone.
Gather around folks.
Come on, folks gather around.
Listen, just as we planned,
the rowdies from Vishakapattinam
have arrived.
They're put up at the marriage hall
in the town.
If we point them to Jayaendran,
they'll kill him.
Listen, no one should know
the purpose of their visit.
Okay, sir.
If Jayaendran, comes to know,
we'll be in big trouble.
Sulthan shouldn't know anything about it.
Also, Jayaendran should die.
Yeah right,
as if this is going to happen.
It's not going to end well.
-He's always so negative.
-Ignore him.
Everyone leave.
Get back to your homes.
Listen, when I return I'll take attendance.
Even if one of you goes missing,
I'll kill everyone.
Sulthan, don't leave us behind.
Sulthan, please let us come too.
Sulthan, let's us come along too.
King-Kong,
I thought you said, it's a village.
It looks like a deserted forest
Obviously, no one allows farmers
to carry out agriculture these days.
Are you here to find me a match
or for a vacation?
-They've arrived at the perfect
auspicious time.
I wonder who's my father-in-law
among them.
It must be the bald one.
-Son-in-law, your hair is your asset!
-My dear, father-in-law.
Bloody, King-Kong that's not
your father-in-law. It's him.
Thank God, Sulthan didn't notice.
Dear Lord Veerabadhra.
You're finally here to save us.
You're our guardian angel!
Gran, I'm not the groom-to-be,
it's him.
She's not the girl, let's go inside.
Lord Veerabhadra has arrived
to save the village.
An important thing.
Sulthan shouldn't know the purpose
of our visit to this village.
-Namaste.
-Welcome, everyone.
Wow, King-Kong,
the house is built on teak wood.
-Burma teak wood.
-Looks like your in-laws are loaded.
Fantastic!
How can you not wear a watch
for a meet like this?
-What are you doing?
-You should look dapper.
-Namaste, everyone!
-Riches, know the way of life.
I went around the house,
it looks great.
-Don't go overboard.
-Yes!
Coffee is here.
Hey, old hag,
that Afro is the bridegroom.
Oh, God! They've found a dork
for my grand-daughter.
Hey, old hag, get lost!
Hey, they're calling you a dork
and you're laughing.
She didn't call me a dork.
That was for you.
Sulthan.
Sit down!
Sulthan!
Hey, Sulthan.
We're here to find him a match.
Not for you.
-Sit down.
Oh, no, that was embarrassing!
Dude, look, the girl has arrived.
-Get lost!
-That hurts!
I can't believe it myself,
if they say she's my cousin.
Can't digest the fact that he's got
such a beautiful cousin.
Son, do you like the girl?
Be prompt with your answer.
Please don't come up with lame excuses.
-I was saying...
-I can't take this anymore.
The girl is gorgeous.
I'm having hard time saying no.
I don't care if people come down to
beat me up...
I'm going to say, yes!
-Oh, God!
-I don't like the girl.
-Why?
-She's not the right match for me.
-Hey, I ought to...
-Oh, no!
Hey, swear that you really
don't like the girl?
-Isn't she beautiful?
-To hell with her.
She isn't beautiful.
I don't like that girl.
You're a sweetheart!
Okay, fine.
Remove that watch.
-God is great.
-How do I remove it?
-Remove, damn it!
-How do I remove it?
You ought to be lucky to
find the right girl and a watch.
Lost the watch!
Are you sure that you don't
like your cousin?
Buddy, are you trying to
convince me?
I don't like her. Rejected!
-Beautiful!
-I've made up my mind.
I already rejected you,
stop staring!
My name is, Vikram.
-But everyone calls me, Sulthan.
-I told you, right.
I work as Robotics Engineer in Bombay.
I make 3 lakhs a month.
Soon, I'll be starting my own company
and will leave to, Japan.
Son, why are telling us about yourself?
I'm getting to it.
Bridegroom, didn't like the girl
as she's not pretty.
But I like her a lot.
-What?
-Oh, God!
I would like to marry her.
That's why you reassured, is it?
But I don't like him.
Thank God!
Thank you.
She rejected you and you're smiling.
You're too much, man!
Do you have any sense?

How do you guys like my poetry?
Son, that girl anyway rejected you.
Let's get back to our city.
That's right, Sulthan. Let's go back!
Sulthan has arrived!
Brothers in arms, listen carefully.
We've left behind violence.
Until that girl accepts my proposal...
all of us are going to stay
at this village.
Understood!
I don't care if it takes 6 months.
If you guys do something
behind my back...
I'll skin everyone alive.
I'll beat up you guys like a hunter.

Sulthan, if you don't mind.
What would you do, if you learn
that she's not my actual cousin?
I will remove your name...
From the family card!
He's threatening to kill.
Son, we have some work to tend to.
There's nothing outside for you people.
If you stay indoors,
that'll do good to the village.
-Do you have the vehicle ready?
-Can't hear!
Hey, is it ready?
-Let's go.
-We should return, before Sulthan, does.
If not we'll be in trouble.
Go slowly,
don't get too close to the vehicle.
Turn around!
Pull over to the left. Stop!
I said, stop, damn it!
Why did you bring him to drive?
Sir, that's him, Jayendra.
That's Jayendra!
Hey, start the vehicle.
Hey, King-Kong,
when will your cousin pass by?
Dude, if by chance you get
married to her...
you may have to do all the chores
at home.
I have you to do all my chores!
Chores for me and the girl for you,
is it?
-Hey, she has arrived!
-So?
My dear, cousin!
My chief has been starving since morning
to get a glimpse of you.
Come over and speak to him.
Rowdies don't scare me.
The folks of village may be scared of you.
But I'm not scared.
-Oh!
-Get lost. I can't talk to him.
If you were truly gutsy,
then why did you hire us
to kill the rowdies?
Why didn't you chase him away yourself?
You couldn't right?
If you don't go and talk to him...
he won't let me live in peace.
Later, he'll come to know
we're not related to each other.
The village's problem won't be solved.
And we'll be exposed.
I ought to...
Buffalo, step aside.
Hey, step down.
-No, Sulthan.
-Why?
She look outraged.
What if she harms you?
Hey, don't embarrass me.
Get lost!
-No, Sulthan.
-Damn it...
-Go and fetch it.
-Hail Sulthan!
Sorry. He's too sincere with his job.
-This color suits--
-I said, I don't like you.
But still you keep stalking me.
I heard you wanted to talk.
Come on, talk.
Talk!
-I don't know what to say--
-Speak up!
-I don't know how to put it--
-Come on, say it.
Shut up. Don't be an angry bird!
The guy out there,
is he truly your cousin?
-Just take a look at him.
Why?
It's 'cause, you're too beautiful.
Despite many efforts,
I'm not able to see him as your cousin.
Moreover, they're all rowdies.
I have a doubt that,
they might've threatened you to say it.
Come on, no one will dare to lie
about being ones' cousin.
He's definitely my cousin.
He resembles our deity, Karipootharaja.
Karipootharaja, is it!
-Is that all?
-No.
I'm leaving.
Oh, no, listen.
Listen!
Listen, I went a little overboard.
Please wad off evil.
It's not fair that you've been using
your daughter as a pawn.
And that guy has been stalking him.
Please, shut up.
You've never paid heed to my woes.
You'll learn when it backfires.
When I have a daughter myself,
it's not fair to ask someone else to do it.
-That's why...
-I'm your daughter, dad.
Not just you, even I'm ready to
do anything for this village.
Please be careful, dear.
They're all rowdies!
Kasi!
They all have left to the
Taluk office.
If we rat them out to Sulthan.
They'll run away from there.
Idiot!
We can't make them our enemies
nor go up against them.
They're very powerful!
I'm going to do this alone.
What did you say his name was?
I'll kill him, before they do!
Run faster, I don't want to miss the bus.
Get a seat--
Namaste. Hearty welcome!
Oh, damn, she's staring at me.
Hey, Rukku,
we got into the bus of rowdies.
Let's get down.
We'll take the next one.
-Hey, start the bus.
-Hey, get moving!
Hey, you can't just evade so easily.
The bus has left. Buy a ticket.
Fine, as you're my cousin.
The ticket is on me.
I'll do you a favour.
Please be a good girl
and sit next to Sulthan.
Dear, are you getting angry?
I really don't care.
Stare as much as possible.
But keep in mind,
your village is at stake.
Don't piss me off!
Take your bags,
go and sit next to him.
Go!
Come on, pick it up!
Make sure you don't graze me.
-Stop giving me stares.
-Bloody moron!
She never listens to me!
She looks very angry.
I'm sure she won't sit next to me.
It's better I get up.
Please take a seat. I'll stand.
Sulthan, don't stand, sit next to her.
Sit next to her, Sulthan.
Shut up!
Hey!
Don't mind us.
Come on, sit down.
Oh, no!
I said, sit down!
Sit down.
She looks pissed.
What the hell do you want?
I just want you.
I wasn't kidding about
getting married to you.
I've never met a woman like you.
Vibrant bindi.
Eyes laced with kohl.
Followed by a pretty nose ring.
You're truly beautiful
Moreover, you look just like how
my father had described.
Brave women. Fearless.
You don't mind about speaking boldly.
This is my mother's toe-ring.
My dad asked me to give it to
the girl I'm going to get married to.
I wish to give it to you.
-Sulthan, what happened?
What happened?
What happened, Sulthan?
Nothing to worry. I'm fine.
What happened, buddy?
I was sitting next to your cousin.
Our shoulders touched.
And then I felt a jolt through my body.
If so, you should be rubbing your body
not just your thighs.
It's 'cause it felt like someone
pricked me with a pin.
It's not just a feeling, dude.
She truly pricked you with a pin.
-I ought to--
-Hey, calm down.
-Love?
-I'll kill you.
We're about to hit a bump,
jump and hug her.
-She's a devil.
-Morons!
Who is the new officer?
He has a political background, boss.
-How dare he lists rules to us?
-He's not aware of your power.
If he doesn't sign by tomorrow.
Kill him and his entire family.
Okay, boss!
Bhai, forbade you to go outside.
Why are you disobeying his orders?
Let go, damn it!
Hey, Damodaram.
Hey, Damodaram!
-Stop the cart.
-Hold on.
Why did you leave the village
without informing anyone?
It's not fair.
There's nothing left to do
in this village.
They've hired goons from the city.
They'll kill Jayaendran for sure.
When? When exactly?
My children have been crying all night
asking for food.
There's not even a grain of rice
at the house.
As a father, how do you expect me
to bear it all?
To hell with this village.
Dear Lord, only you can save this village!
I want to talk to you.
Sure, let's talk.
Since childhood,
I've been visiting this temple.
The village used to look like
a green-heaven from all corners.
It's been 4 years, since,
they stopped farming on these lands.
That's why I've taken an oath
at this temple.
The farming should revive and the
village should breathe green.
The rice harvested from this land
should be served at my wedding.
Okay.
I took an oath saying, the man who'll
make this happen will be my husband.
So, please don't waste your time
lurking behind me.
I will not break my oath.
It's better you finish the job
you came for and get back to your life.
What job?
Rukmani!
You're behaving like a kid
ranting about promises and oath.
Say something that suits me, like becoming
a Steve Jobs, Sundar Pichai or Bill gates.
I'll try becoming one.
How can I take up agriculture?
To you people,
agriculture is an unallocated job right?
The names Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.
There's a farmer somewhere starving
his family to feed you and the big-wigs.
And is continuing to do agriculture.
Without stepping into the mud
or toiling yourself...
with the arrogance that money
can buy you food and water
will never respect a farmer!
What's happening?
Why is everyone gathered?
Jayaendran, is not your problem.
Your problem is entirely different.
What are you saying, sir?
Without your knowledge...
there are people using this village
to crack a huge deal.
They're not after your lands
but the resource it holds.
Iron!
This land and that mountain contains
high "Iron" content.
You're refusing to sell your lands.
And if they force you,
it will end in a protest.
They're well aware of it.
So in the name of rowdyism,
they prevented you from doing farming
and have created a document
which proves that the lands are barren.
In another six months,
they'll take away your lands.
-Sir, we worked hard to earn
these lands.
-Why should we even let them
take it away from us?
Tell me?
I told you so. We could've
compromised and taken the money.
Now, we're left with nothing.
Bloody moron, you've never said
anything good.
Selling the land that feeds us,
is like selling our parents.
-Disgusting fellow.
-Mister, I'm speaking the truth.
Do you think you people have a choice?
There's only one option left.
Like how they're trying to prove
that these lands are barren...
similarly, you too prove that
these lands are fertile
and it'll yield crops in abundance.
For that to happen, you people
have to immediately start farming.
And that should happen in another
six months.
Protests won't save your land...
neither going to the court
will fetch you justice.
I hail from a farmer's family...
that's why I'm here to help.
I'm informing this to you people
by risking my life.
Please save your land.
Let's go.
-Calm down. Let's discuss further.
-Bloody sinners!
You people will never prosper!
You don't let us live in peace.
I've lost my son and my husband.
Now, I'm going to lose my land too.
I hope you're happy now.
Why are you being an obstacle?
Lord Veerabhadara,
what are you waiting for?
Can't you hear the cries of poor people?
Please help this land and its people.
Hack that beast down to death.
Please do something.
Please do something about it.
Please do something about it.
Are you serious?
"Why are you being an obstacle?"
"Uncle, I'm glad you're here to save us!"
"Please help this land and its people."
"Hack that beast down to death."
Bhai is calling.
Tell me, Bhai!
Hey, are you with, Sulthan?
Yes, he's with me.
Make sure until evening,
Sulthan, doesn't visit the market.
What happened?
Because, we're in the bus
heading towards market.
Are you headed towards the market?
Bhai, I'm ready!
Brother, we're ready.
Hey, how long will it take
for you to get here?
In 5 minutes,
we'll arrive at the market.
Hey, find out who hired men
to kill me.
If you run into new faces,
don't spare them, bring them to me.
-Hey.
-We're ready!
Die, damn it!
Bhai, we're ready.
-Hey, don't be in a haste.
Wait for my orders.
Who hired men to kill me?
He's right at the mark.
I don't know.
-Wait. I'll tell you when to strike.
-Chief.
-We shouldn't mess it up.
Do you understand?
Smoke them out!
Who dared, damn it?
-Bhai, can you hear me?
-Wait.
Who is it?
Hey.
Tell me!
Ready.
-You people have 2 minutes.
-Shouldn't miss the target.
Now, get into ac--
-Hey, hey, hey! Hold on.
Not now!
Wait until the bus leaves.
I'll keep you informed.
Wait it out until the bus leaves.
-Sulthan is inside the bus.
Don't be in a hurry.
Sulthan, please hear me out.
Don't go out there.
Hey, don't do anything now.
Hold your positions.
Sulthan is here.
Hey, Sulthan is out here.
Fall back, damn it.
-Let's not do this in Sulthan's presence.
We'll handle this later.
We'll execute this on a different day.
Abort!
Sir, I have no clue about it.
Hey!
Brother!
-He's coming to kill you.
Who is it?
Sulthan!
You guys are still thirsty for blood.
No one should stay out here anymore.
-Everyone leave.
-Sulthan--
Uncle, you heard me!
Sulthan, this was your father's
last word.
We'll have to respect his word.
Ignore the dead.
Think about the people who are alive.
Until I'm alive, I'll make sure
none of you indulge in violence.
Leave!
-Sir, help us.
-Son, please help us.
-Sir, please save our people.
-Brother, what happened?
Son, Jayaendran has taken over
the village.
Grandpa!
Please, don't beat up my grandpa.
Please don't beat him.
Before I skin her alive...
it's better if you people confess it.
Who hired men to kill me?
Who is it?
He's destroying the village.
Son, please come and save us.
He's on a killing spree.
The bodies are piling up.
No one came forward to
help the farmers.
Only your father came forward...
and promised to save us
and our lands.
The entire village is dependent
on that promise.
Please come and save us.
Sir, please save us all.
Sulthan, don't think you're doing
something wrong.
Your father may not be alive today...
but his promise still lives as a hope
in people's hearts.
Just this once,
let us resort to violence.
After which we'll abide to everything
you ask of us.
Just this once...
Just this once, let us do it.
Sulthan, what are you doing?
Sulthan, don't do this.
Sulthan, don't do it.
I'm sure he's not as dangerous
as you people.
Violence is not the answer to everything.
I'll speak to him.
Sulthan, please hear us out.
Don't go alone out there.
-Don't go. Let us come too.
-It was a mistake.
Hey, break the lock.
Oh, please spare me!
I know that it's not him.
Tell me who is it?
Who hired men to kill me?
-They've brutally killed my son.
-Sir, look at the carnage
they've left behind.
Oh, God, no!
Uncle!
Uncle, they beat up, grandpa!
Lord Veerabhadara,
are you still not convinced?
Can't you see the innocent blood
is being spilled?
Come to your senses, my lord!
Damn, the Panther has made its entry.
-Tell me, who is it?
-Oh, no, it's hurting.
Brother, he's behind you.
That's the man who saved your life.
Hey, who are you?
I know why you people have come down
to this village.
This is not your place neither
it's your problem to solve.
But you saved my life.
Don't sacrifice your men in vain.
I'm sparing your life.
Get lost!
"Not even a single petty case should be
filed against them."
"Keep this in mind,
if something goes wrong...
nobody can save them."
"If they happen to run into some trouble...
stand by them."
I'll handle, Sulthan.
You guys put down, Jayaendran.
Come on, guys!
Veera!
Hail Sulthan!
Hey, you're making a mistake.
"Raze him down!"
"Hail Sulthan!"
"Raze him down!"
"Hail Sulthan!"
"Raze him down!"
"Hail Sulthan!"
"Raze him down!"
"Hail Sulthan!"
"Raze him down!"
Nailed it!
-Don't look!
-Get lost!
Wad off all the evil engulfing
these angels!
Hey, we had a wrong impression
about, Sulthan.
They way he bashed that man,
I felt it in my bones.
Sulthan has guts of glory!
Make a note, no one can stand a chance
in front of Sulthan.
True that. We're going to rule the city.
-Pay up.
Kasi, the focus has entirely
shifted to, Sulthan.
Do something sooner and turn things around.
Wait and watch, the entire city will be
under Sulthan's control.
-Brother, please have food.
-Sure, dear.
Sulthan, she's deliberately ignoring you.
She isn't ignoring.
She might've not noticed me.
Just watch, she'll come back
and hug me with joy.
Brother, do you want some gravy?
-That's enough, dear.
-X Y Z
Say what?
Why is she staring at me again?
What's with the attitude?
Shoulders down!
Remove your shades.
The respect seemed to have
diminished further.
Go!
Listen...
I beat up a gang of hooligans,
just for you.
X Y Z, you don't have to say it!
At least, you can thank me.
This feast is our way of saying thanks.
Eat well and please get going.
Get lost!
-Say what?
-I said, I will go and have my meal.
I can even handle an army.
I wonder, why I'm scared of her.
Big-eye-doe!
Suthan, phone for you.
-Hello.
-Son, this is lawyer speaking.
Tell me, sir!
Did you watch the news?
Police has been shooting down
rowdies like dogs.
They're painting the town red
with their blood.
This encounter was not
a planned action.
Just self-defense!
Anyway, Vizag should be crime-free.
This is just the beginning.
When we're done with
the operation...
rowdies and rowdyism in Vizag
will be wiped clean.
No matter what happens,
make sure they don't return to the city.
Be careful, son.
Okay, sir.
This evening we'll be leaving
to the city.
-Is it? Go safe.
-Okay, sir. Go safe.
Hey, listen closely,
we're going back home in the evening.
You can't find food on the train
during the night.
It's better stuff yourselves
as much as you can.
-Understood?
-Hey, Sulthan, stop thinking and eat well.
Hey, pour him gravy.
I heard you guys are part of
the same family.
-Is it?
-Yes.
I believe your food expenses
will soar high.
They eat about 10 sacks of rice in a day.
Why do you ask?
Son, you shouldn't keep an account
of ones' meal.
If there were 100 members in my family...
I will provide food for 10 villages.
How?
I would've asked them to get into field...
on 10 acres of land,
I would've planted veggies
on the other side, banana plantation
and finally on the other side,
pulses and canes.
They're incorrigible. No one knows
anything about agriculture.
Son, even the software professionals are
doing agriculture.
These guys are capable too.
Your ancestors must've done agriculture.
Agriculture runs in your blood.
Seeds will yield regardless
who sows it.
Hello! Hello! Hello!
When we went to Vizag to meet
his father in regards to our problem...
we mentioned that we're farmers.
He didn't demand even a penny.
All he asked was
for one fist full of paddy.
That was his nobility.
As farmers, not just a fist full...
but we'll give them a share
from our harvest.
Son, I hope you're happy
with the decision.
I was told that you people are leaving
to Vizag this evening.
Please feel free to ask,
if you need anything more before you leave.
It's right opportunity,
ask his daughter's hand in marriage.
Go ahead, don't hesitate.
He'll state his demands.
Sulthan!
Greetings to one and all.
Violence was fine
until my father was alive.
Or when our men did it too.
But I never liked it.
But when I give it a thought...
cutting down a tree is a sin,
but cutting down thorns is not.
Rightly said!
Few years ago, we discussed about
having both science and agriculture.
But when I visited this village I realized,
science has advanced
but agriculture has been left behind.
No one seems to care about it.
That includes me too.
I was under the impression,
money is enough to buy food and water.
But that's not the case now.
The view of this village from the hill
should be green all-over.
The rice harvested from this land
should be served at my wedding.
I should be the one...
who made it happen.
-No idea what's running in his mind.
Hey-- Hey, what's he saying?
What is he saying?
Brother, what is he saying?
You don't understand is it?
Let me put it in simple terms.
My brothers and I are going to stay back
for 5 months in this village...
and carry out agriculture
along with you folks.
Agriculture?
What did he say, Michael?
He wants to carry out agriculture.
Aren't you folks happy about it?
Son, what have you done?
Agriculture?
To us agriculture is not
an unallocated job.
We're capable and determined to do it.
So, please consider us as your children...
and lend us your land to
carry out agriculture.
That's it!
Women and young girls reside
in our village.
If we let the rowdies
inside our village...
how do we live in peace?
Hey, they're way better than you.
They risked their lives
and saved our village.
You can't just jump to conclusions.
Similarly, once a man asked for our land...
for 4 years he tortured us like animals.
They're in large number like an army.
If they've made a decision,
then they'll destroy this village.
In my opinion,
it's better they stay back.
You're a loner. You wouldn't understand
the woes of a family man.
Old man has a point.
It's better for the village,
if they stay back.
Enough, dear. Women are not supposed to
voice out in council.
Uncle, Jayaendran is not dead yet.
He is just injured.
Hey, If he returns...
he'll avenge us all
by burning down this village.
-He has a point!
They're not our problem
at the moment.
Our problem right now...
is to irrigate our lands for next 6 months,
turn them fertile and save our lands.
To prove that the lands aren't barren
but are fertile to carry out agriculture.
This will happen only if they stay back.
Hey, she's got a solid point, brother.
No, this won't work out.
For the sake of our lands,
we can't lose respect.
-Tell me!
-Hey, shut up.
We don't have a choice.
My daughter has a point.
Fine, who is going to give them
land to carry out agriculture?
Cat caught your tongue?
Tell me, who is going to give them land?
I own 1 acre of land,
I'll give them my land.
What will they do with just 1 acre?
Hey, I own 8 acres of land.
I'll give them too.
-I'll give them.
-I'll give them too.
The lands are idle at the moment.
I'll give them too.
Sulthan, if you ask us to spill blood,
we're game.
Hard work, agriculture
and toiling ourselves won't suit us.
Wham, Bam, Van Damme!
Doesn't matter if it's the leg or hand
just 15 minutes!
Later, when we return
feast on a good meal and take rest.
Why do we have to put ourselves
through such hardship?
Brother, Sambasivam,
you spoke really well.
Come here.
Congratulations, go ahead!
Sambasivam...
You left out, "brother."
Give me the right answer to the question...
the respect will add on, automatically.
Tell me, does pumpkin grow on plants
or on the creeper?
Come on!
It doesn't grow on either.
It grows on the trees.
Care to explain?
Suthan, brinjal, tomatoes and
ladies finger, they're small vegetables.
Plant and creepers can hold them.
But the pumpkin is huge.
Plant and creepers can't hold it.
So, it can only grow on trees.
Beautiful!
Pumpkins grow on trees.
And you've seen them?
Yes, Sulthan, I'm very sure about it.
So, you can spill blood
but can't drop a sweat.
You guys know to stuff yourselves
with food,
but agriculture is tough, is it?
-You don't even know how it grows.
-He couldn't reply to a simple question.
Listen, you guys agreed to do
any job I offered.
Here on, agriculture is your only job.
People who refused to work...
You have a custom, where the winner
decides what the loser does.
Come on, defeat me in a fight...
and you can do as per your will.
Son, how can they fight you?
No, Kasi.
It's decided. Tomorrow 5 AM,
everyone be ready.
-We're dead meat!
-So early?
Right on!
-Keep moving!
Bless us all, dear lord!
Come on, everyone!

Sir, do you need a hair cut or a shave?
Oh, lord!
Son, the first fist of seeds...
should be sowed by the luckiest of all.
You please do the honors!
They raised me well.
I'm sure they can do a good job.
Let uncle do it.
♪ Feeling giddy, Oh, God ♪
Joker!
Bloody joker!
That's a troop of elephants!
Not just one or two,
they're more than hundred in number.
No one can dare to go past them
into that village.
Their strength is...
It's just the one man!
Ravanan!
100-Head-Ravanan!
You can't do squat without my help.
Back in the day,
an acre was just 250 rupees.
-Why isn't she out yet?
-That's impossible in the present day.
Never smiles!
-Hey, King-Kong,
Sulthan is in a romantic mood. Talk to him.
-What's with the night stroll?
-Come with me.
-You speak to him.
-Go ahead.
Why am I the scapegoat?
Sulthan.
Enough with farming,
let's get back to Vizag.
They asked me to convey this message.
You can't ask the killers
to pick thorns.
We'll manage to ride share autos
and make a living.
You people should've thought about it
before getting here.
We've made a promise.
We'll have to stay until we resolve
the problem.
Not to worry, Sulthan.
Just give us an hour...
we'll hack down every soul
that are a threat to this village.
Sulthan, shall I start packing?
Don't give me that look.
I won't repeat this again.
You people have to stay out here,
until I say so.
And you should do whatever
I ask you to do.
People who have a problem,
let's fight it out.
You can come solo or as a group.
I'm ready! Who's up for it?
Junga, no one should move from here.
-Hail, Sulthan.
-If someone moves, skin them alive.
We're not bananas to peel our skin.
Hail Sulthan!
Hey, beastie-guard!
Even Hanuman was not so faithful
to Lord Ram.
I became a rowdy by beating up
my school teacher.
At least respect my history!
I'll beat you to pulp, damn it.
Every dog has its day!
There's another option, damn it!
There's an option!
If everyone agrees to it.
I'll fight, Sulthan!
I'll defeat him in the fight.
How dare you fight, Sulthan?
You have to fight me first.
Hey, stop fighting!
I said, stop the bloody fight.
Why the hell are you guys fighting?
Sulthan, I really can't figure out
what's going on in your mind.
Why are you putting our men
through this hardship?
You're even putting the village
in hardship. Why?
Are you doing this
for the sake of that girl?
It's for us!
It's for the sake of our family.
What?
Until yesterday,
I thought we'll return after 6 months.
But today, I felt,
agriculture is the job for them.
If they're here,
no one will commit any crime.
We'll have to turn them into farmers.
Are you kidding, son?
They're leather-heads!
Son, you're day dreaming.
It's impossible.
They'll never change.
Drop this plan.
A person who has never seen any good,
tends to live a weary life.
Just show them the good way of life,
they'll live it better than us.
Give me six months time.
If they still don't change...
I'll drop everything and return to Mumbai.
Do you think they'll agree to it?
Don't let them know about it.
Let them think,
I'm doing this for that girl.
That's not the issue at hand.
Then?
If we stay back in this village,
we'll have to resort to violence.
To change them, we should make sure
they don't resort to violence.
I'm not sure,
how I am going to handle both the notions.
Grandpa, who is he?
Grandpa, Sulthan has arrived.
Wow! Ravanan!
100-Head-Ravanan!
Jayendran, said so.
I didn't believe him.
You lived up to your reputation.
I am Ravanan too.
Just that, I got only one head.
Not an issue though.
Money can buy as many men I want.
So... money matters!
What did this village offer you?
I'll make an offer way more
than they offered.
You and your henchmen,
should work for me.
Not even a strand of grass
should grow on this land.
They're not rowdies.
But my brothers!
Fine, name your price,
and I'll honor that.
I want this land and that mountain.
You have to work for me.
Land and mountain.
Is that all you need?
I'll ask them to give it to you.
How does 6 feet sound to you?
Powerful, doesn't mean you should
make more enemies.
Here on, make sure to keep a count
on your brothers.
Next time I meet you,
I won't be civil.
Hey!
How dare you lay hands on Sulthan?
-I dare you!
-Say the word, I'll break his skull.
Sulthan, I'll hack him into pieces.
This village has only witnessed my anger.
They haven't seen the rage of my brothers.
Don't instigate them!
This is their land and theirs only.
Just listening to their woes,
I beat up a person to death.
Now I've witnessed it myself.
I'll kill you, damn it!
Don't you dare return.
I'll be right here.
He went overboard, sir.
The arrogance comes from
the support of 100 people.
We should break his support.
The 100 people are not supporting him.
It's him who's supporting an army!
You shouldn't cut the tail
of a snake to kill it.
You have to smash the snake's head.
I want to smash his head!
Hey, they're extremely dangerous than us.
Be careful.
If they wake up,
they'll tear us part.
Our target is the person
lying on that cot...
we have to behead him.
Hey, watch your step.
Wait, if he wakes up,
he'll make noise.
We'll gag and stab him.
Hey, let's slit the throat directly.
It's best to gag him first, then slit--
Hey, you guys should've planned it
before you got here.
I've deprived them of blood
for past two months.
If they wake up,
you guys will end up dead.
No matter what happens,
make sure it's done in silence.
Understood?
Silence!
Sir, please spare him.
Sir, please don't hit me.
I beg of you.
Please don't beat him.
He might die.
Oh, no, please someone stop him!
Please spare him!
Michael!
Michael, let go of him.
Please hear me out.
Michael, let go of him.
Michael, let him go.
Can't you hear me?
I said, let go of him. Let go!
How many more are you going to kill?
Why don't you listen?
I told you so, that this day will come.
No can stand up to them,
even if they harass our women.
I wonder what else is left
to endure.
-He would've died if he hadn't stopped him.
This village feared the rowdies.
Recently, they've come to terms
and started respecting us.
And you--
Uncle, Michael, shouldn't be here anymore.
Ask him to leave.
Sulthan, I don't think so--
I don't care, ask him to leave!
I don't want to see his face anymore.
I'll kill him, if I do. Get lost!
Sul--
Sulthan.
I'll apologize on behalf of Michael.
Michael wouldn't have done it
without a reason.
I'm sure he had his reasons
to beat up that boy.
You've already humiliated him
in front of the village.
Sulthan, please forgive him.
Why are you hesitating?
Go and tell him!
Brother!
Sir, he didn't do anything wrong.
It was that boy who tried harassing
my daughter.
He came as a guardian angel
and saved my daughter.
That's right, brother.
Despite getting beaten up by you...
he remained silent to save my honor.
I acted in haste.
I'm sorry, Michael!
You've been with us
for so many years.
Sulthan, with no regards,
asked you to leave.
We won't matter to him at all.
After Chief's demise,
whether it's the gang or to me...
you're our leader!
It doesn't look good, when you're
getting beaten up in front of us.
It's extremely humiliating!
Michael, a Lion can lead a herd of goats.
But, Michael, a goat shouldn't
be a leader to a herd of lions!
Hey, wake up everyone!
Sulthan, look,
how beautifully it has grown.
The yield has been great this time.
I never expected it.
Can't believe the rowdies
made this possible.
-Son!
-Sir, please don't, you're an elder.
Son, many lives were lost,
to see our lands bloom with green.
You appeared as a God to us!
I thought I'll never get to
see this before I die.
When I met you the first time,
I knew you'll be our savior.
And it came true.
Thanks a lot, son. Stay blessed!
Thanks a lot, sir.
Come on, partner.
This is our village.
I wanted to speak to you...
Tell me.
Cowards! Bloody traitors!
This is a 10,000 crore project.
Canceling it was the only option left.
You promised to prevent them
from carrying out agriculture.
Did you do it?
The village is blooming with greenery.
If we try to prove that the lands
are barren, we'll be doomed.
Maybe I can work something out.
I've postponed the inspection
one too many times.
For your sake,
one last time I'll postpone it.
Use that time to prove that
the lands are barren.
After which we can discuss further
about the project.
[henchmen singing folk song]
[song resumes]
Hey, don't change the mood.
I wanted to speak to you.
-I wanted to speak to you.
-Hey, shut up, guys.
[continues to sing]
Awesome!
-Idiot, shut up!
-Bloody, nuisance!
Hey, shut up!
You please go ahead.
The entire village is happy.
The village folks respects you a lot.
But I didn't treat you well.
Sorry!
Come on, don't bother.
I'll take care of all the household chores.
But... I won't shift to in-laws' house.
Neither I'll go to America or Bombay.
I'll stay right here at my village.
If you're fine with it.
I'm okay with it too.
Okay, eh?
What's she saying?
I really don't get it.
Sulthan, she agreed to marry you.
Listen, I'm okay with it too!
The entire village has come together
to ask my daughter's hand in marriage.
I'm sure, I can't find
a better match than him.
I'm really happy!

Hey, Junga, why are we at the
registrar office?
I have no idea, master.
Hey, advocate. What brings you here?
Mansoor, I think you'll leave me
with no job.
I don't get you?
Sulthan, has bought 2 acres of land
for each one of you.
Land? How did he manage to
pay for them?
He had to sell one house in Vizag
to pay for them.
-Did he really sold the house?
-Yes!
Uncle, I hope you're happy!
We bought land in the heaven
Son, this is not right.
That was the only property your dad had
left behind for you.
Why did you?
What dad left behind is not wealth...
but you people are my treasure.
Not just that.
Despite me telling him not to,
he used up all his savings for it.
Sir, please go and do your job.
-Son, I'm stating the fact.
-Sir, you please leave.
Hey, why did you do it?
Uncle, it's not a big deal.
You had saved up to start
your own company.
It's just money.
It's true, I'll have to slave
under someone for a decade.
I don't care.
But my brothers won't indulge
in violence anymore.
And no one will call them
rowdies anymore.
They're now bosses.
In fact, farmers!
"You raise him well."
"And he'll look after you."
-Driver, the tire is punctured.
Everyone step out.
Board the next bus that follows.
The tire is punctured.
Sulthan!
-The bus tire is punctured.
-The bus following us is ours too...
they won't ask for a ticket.
You board that bus.
Folks keep moving,
Hey, Sulthan!
Uncle!
-Master!
-Hey!
-Master? Master?
-Uncle!
Here you go, put pressure on it.
Driver, start the vehicle. Driver!
Master, you'll be fine!
Uncle, you'll be fine.
Junga, keep pressure on the wound.
-Hey, go!
-Come on, let's leave.
-Be careful, Master.
-I'm not able to walk.
Uncle, you'll be fine.
Let's go the hospital.
Be careful!
-Junga, take care of him, I'll be back.
-Sulthan, wait!
I hope you didn't get hurt?
I'm not hurt, uncle.
Uncle, let's go to the hospital.
Hey, don't cry, Sulthan.
I should've died long ago.
I thought only death will
bring me peace.
But...
...the last 4 months,
I lived my life with peace and happiness.
Thanks to you.
This village is the right place for them.
They're ruffians and are big fools.
But, Sulthan, make sure you don't
abandon them.
I will never abandon them, uncle.
Hey, Junga!
Take good care of Sulthan.
Su-- Sulthan, when you were born...
I wished that I should die saving you.
It has finally happened.
Uncle, please hear me out.
Let's go to the hospital.
Sulthan...
Uncle.
Uncle.
Uncle!
Uncle!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Oh, no!
Hey, isn't that our men?
That's Junga and Sulthan.
Mansoor Bhai!
-Sulthan!
-Mansoor Bhai!
Bhai!
Mansoor Bhai!
Mansoor Bhai!
-Hello.
-Sulthan.
-Sorry, Sulthan.
I heard the head-honcho has fallen!
Come on, you should've been more careful
in taking care of your brothers.
Until now, I was not aware of
your weakness.
I am aware now!
The troop of elephants that support you
are your weakness.
Police problem. Encounter!
-Your notion to reform them.
I have all the information on you
and your people.
-Obviously, I can't keep calm
after knowing it all.
So, I've thrown a stone at your beehive.
-What you were afraid of...
is about to happen.
You'll regret, damn it!
Stop!
-Where are you headed?
-Sulthan, let us go. He has to die!
Sulthan, we'll be at peace only
if we hack him down to death.
Let's finish the final rites.
Be calm. Go!
Calm? How do you expect us
to be calm?
One of us is dead.
We'll have to behead and kill him.
Killing him won't bring back, Bhai.
Brother, you too are talking nonsense.
Brother, please get back.
Brother, get back!
Sulthan, I won't. Not possible!
Only after his death,
the final rites will be carried out.
Go! Go and hack him to death.
Just like this, you must've killed many.
They too had families that cared.
You people are outraged,
'cause one of your own died.
We reap what we sow!
This is not happening.
One of us has been killed.
Instead of letting us take down
that murderer...
you've been lecturing us about morals.
You're the reason for everything.
If you had let us kill him on that day...
Bhai would've been alive, today.
Kasi, don't!
Why do you care who dies among us?
To you this village and that girl
are important.
Aren't we your slaves who live
at your mercy?
You've destroyed our gang,
for the sake of one girl.
Do you people still wish to
follow his orders?
-Let's go!
-Can't you hear me?
Don't you understand, damn it?
You guys keep resorting to violence.
Stop, damn it!
He didn't say anything wrong.
We are going!
If you don't approve it.
Then let's fight it out.
Let the fight decide,
whether we should kill him or not.
The loser should follow the orders
from the winner.
Come on, let's fight it out!
Michael, have you gone mad?
How dare you challenge him for a fight?
Did you forget that it's our, Sulthan?
What? Our Sulthan?
Bloody, he got the man killed
who named him, Sulthan.
Sulthan, my foot!
You guys have to go through me.
Junga!
Michael!
Michael!
Come on!
Michael, we gotta win!
Come on, damn it!
Come on, fight me!
Come on!
Come on!
Michael!
Michael, we're leaving.
Finish the fight sooner.
Yeah!
Come, Sulthan. Hey, make way for him.
Hey, where do you think you're going?
I'll kill you, damn it!
If you touch him,
he might not rest in peace.
Get lost!
Hey, lift him up.
There's nothing left to stay back.
I'm leaving.
-Hey, hear me out.
Where are you guys going?
Hey, we're leaving!
Hey, don't abandon, Sulthan.
Hey!
Hey, listen!
Hey, Naga, at least you stay back.
Please don't leave.
-Hey Sambasivam,
at least you listen to me.
Hey! Oh, no, everyone is leaving.
-Guys please stay back.
Hey, Kasi, please don't leave.
Sulthan, everyone has abandoned us.
You too leave, brother.
Sulthan?
They might do something rash
in haste.
Take care of them.
Uncle.
Since morning
you haven't eaten anything.
Don't feel like it.
I'm not hungry.
I mean...
Let's go, dear.
What? Are you serious?
So, there's no one with him?
No, sir. He's all alone.
My time has come!
Tonight that village should be in flames.
They can't be away from you.
They'll soon come back to you.
I've never seen my mother.
I was raised by them.
And I beat them up with
my own hands.
If I hadn't meddled,
Bhai would've been alive.
In the process of reforming them...
I've ended everything.
Hello.
Ravanan!
Did you think that I feared you
and went in hiding?
I went around the nation
scouting for people...
and was in penance for 5 months
to take down you and your people.
Be ready to face me.
Every living soul in that village...
I'm going to either burn or bury them.
At the break of dawn...
that village would've been destroyed,
and you'll be beheaded!
I'm coming, damn it!
What happened?
Son, your men have left.
You're just one person,
what can you do?
Our village is their target.
We'll leave it to the God.
Son, you please leave.
You came from nowhere
and wished to save our land.
Looks like it's not going to happen now.
It's better you leave.
I see you as my own son,
who I lost a while ago.
You're my son too.
At least, you should live your life.
Please, go!
Son, you don't have to stay back
for our sake.
You've lost too much
for the sake of this village.
Enough!
Please leave.
Go away and lead a peaceful life.
"If you make a promise...
in order to keep up that promise
we can even sacrifice our lives
also, we can kill as many if required."
My father made a promise to this village.
To save the land and the folks
that bears it.
My father may not be alive.
But his promise is still alive and kicking.
And to fulfill it, his son is still alive.
If I had to, I'd die to fulfill
the promise.
I swear on this village!
-He's going to face them alone.
I have to be with him.
You folks leave.
Be careful.
Just like you wished.
The rice harvested from this land
will be served at our wedding.
Don't worry. Nothing will happen
to your village.
Nothing should happen to you as well.
Be strong and go safe.
Hey!
Not even a strand of grass
should be left out.
Burn it all!
Junga!
Sulthan, he's about to start the truck.
Don't let him go. Stop him!
Jayaendra!
I'll see what are you going to do now.
Go ahead and burn down
this village to ashes!
Junga, until we're alive...
no one should get past us
and step on this land.
Hail Sulthan!
The warriors have arrived!
I dare you to face them now!
Sulthan, I acted in haste.
Please forgive me.
I wished to become the leader.
But now I understood,
the traits of a leader.
Please forgive me, Sulthan.
We knew only after the
advocate told us.
You're our God!
Sulthan, I believe we shouldn't
fight as rowdies.
But we can fight as farmers!
