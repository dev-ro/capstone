Murder by Death (1976) - 23.976 fps
Warning Traslators: Many word games (jokes)
Do you think they'll come sir?
Oh, they'll come. They'll come all right.
Here, stamp those and mail them.
It's ringing.
Dear, would you walk Miron the other way?
My leg tends to look like a tree
in this fog.
What a god-forsaken spot to get lost!
It's true, I saw a much better
spot a few miles back.
Hello? Hello... hello!
Good. Tell them we're lost.
Nobody answered. The phone went dead!
Then why did you say hello?
That's funny. I could have sworn...
What, Dicky?
It sounded as if somebody
snipped the wire!
Really? What did it sound like?
"Snip!"
Some fog! Aye, Pop?
I've already heard the weather report.
Drive, please.
Boy it's as thick as pea soup! Not a soul
around for miles.
Know what I think, Pop?
Perfect place for a murder!
Conversation like television set on honeymoon: ...
...Unnecessary.
And where are were going anyway, Pop?
And who is this Mr. Twain who invited you
for the weekend?
And what did he mean by
"Dinner and a murder"?
Questions like Athlete's Foot.
After a while...
...very irritating.
To stop car please!
What's wrong?
Stop car, please!
To shut engine off, please.
Listen...
I don't hear nothing! What do you hear?
Double negative, and dog.
So it's a dog. So what?
If I'm not mistaken, dog belong to
Mr. Dick Charleston.
Mr. Charleston?
I am, thank you.  I say, you don't happen
to have seen a little white...
Wang!
A white Wang?
Good heavens! Sidney Wang! What are you
doing in this god-forsaken spot?
No doubt same as you.
Looking for bridge that lead to
home of host,
Mr. Lionel Twain.
You too, eh? Must be important to invite
two such eminent detectives.
Excuse, please, to introduce
Japanese son, Willie.
Hi.
Japanese? But I thought surely you...
Mrs Wang and I could never have children.
Willie adopted number 3 son.
My pleasure. Be careful on this road.
It's treacherous.
Treacherous road like fresh mushroom.
Must always...
Idiot! Not finish mushroom story!
You're idiot!
Well I'm sorry Monsieur Perrier,
but I can see nothing!
This fog is as thick as bouillabaisse.
Nuts!
Beg your pardon?
Nuts! Nuts!
There are no nuts in my chocolate!
And that stupid imbecile in the shop gave
you raisins when I asked you to get me nuts.
He didn't have any nuts!
The man in the shop?
That's the reason I took the raisins!
Oh, never mind. We'll soon be there
for dinner.
- Hot soup...
- Still, monsieur...
Something is not right in all of this, eh?
I can feel it in my buns!
In your what?
In my buns.
Buns? You have buns?
You bought buns and you didn't get me?
Where are they? Where are the buns?
Oh, no monsieur, the bones in my body!
You should not speak with an accent when
you know I'm so hungry.
If you ask me, Sam, this is a wild goose chase.
Nobody asked you, baby.
Yes they did! You asked me.
You asked me back there if I thought...
That was then. This is now.
And nobody knows what tomorrow will be.
That's the way things are whether
we like it or not.
Jesus, Sam, I worry about you sometimes.
I really do!
All right, cut the maloke!
This trip is strictly business with me.
Now wadda you got on this Twain guy?
He was born in San Francisco in 1906.
His mother was
a Roman Catholic, his father was
an Orthodox Jew.
They were separated 2 hours after the marriage.
Any children?
Yeah, 1 daughter, 32. Her name's Irene,
- but she calls herself Rita.
- Just like a dame!
Don't stop, angel, you're doing fine.
He was arrested in 1932 in Chicago for selling
pornographic bibles.
The D.A. couldn't make the charge stick when
the church refused to turn over the bibles.
There's nothing on him until '46...
...when he was picked up in El Paso, Texas,
for trying to smuggle a  truckload of...
...rich white Americans across the border
into Mexico to pick melons.
He was sent to the Dallas State Hospital
for mental observation.
I think we picked ourselves a queer bird, angel.
Anything else?
Oh, yeah. Get this, Sam.
Lionel Twain has one interesting physical
characteristic.
He has no pinkies (little fingers)!
No pinkies?
You mean Twain has only got 8 fingers?
No, he's got 10. He just doesn't have
any pinkies.
- You did your homework good, angel.
- Thanks, Sam.
Where'd you dig up all that stuff?
- Oh, I wrote to Twain and asked him.
- Good thinkin'.
What's the matter?
Wadda ya know? Outta gas.
I saw a station about... five miles back, Sam.
I want you to know I'm gonna be waitin'
for you, baby...
Here's the bridge, Pop.
Doesn't look safe to me.
One way to find out. Drive across!
Aren't you gonna come with me?
Weight of two men may be too much for bridge.
Then why do I get to drive the car?
'Cause I smart enough to get out first.
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Pop.
It's gonna collapse!
Not worry. Father find other way to house.
I made it, Pop!  I made it!
Good, good!
Now come back and get adoptive father.
Look at invitation. What number of house?
Two, two...
Correct!  To, to Twain's house. Continue!
Did you see that?
No.
Neither did I.
Stop! Do not move.
Something wrong here...
What is it, Pop?
Do not ask questions. Do as I say.
When I tell you "jump", you jump!
One, two, three...
Jump!
Holy Shanghai!
Nice counting, Pop!
But how'd you know?
Look on ground.
Ah! Even had correct shoe size.
Someone gone great trouble to make
welcome guests not so welcome.
Ring bell, please.
Are you nuts, Pop?
Someone's trying to kill us!
Yeah!
Should make exciting week end.
Ring, please.
I wish it was Monday morning.
Well, here goes...
Holy cow! They're killing someone in there!
- Calm yourself.
- Didn't you hear a scream?
Oh, no. You heard scream.
More experienced ear heard doorbell.
Listen again.
Mr. Twain has macabre sense of humour, yeah?
Good evening. We have been expecting you.
But in what condition?  Roof in need of repair!
Indeed. I'm afraid the house is falling apart.
May we come in please?
I'm so sorry, I thought you were in.
You are Mr. and Mrs. Charleston?
Not quite. I am inspector Wang of
Catalina Police.
This adopted son Willie.
I trust you had a pleasant journey
despite of the storm.
Strange weather!
Storm only outside when inside!
Oh, that. That's just one of Mr. Twain's
little toys.
An electronic device.
Mr. Twain, as you will soon discover,
prefers his atmosphere murky.
May I have your bag, sir?
No, no. Son will get bag. That is why
I adopted him.
Very good, sir.
One moment, please, while I close the door.
Now, if you will follow me, I will show you
to your room.
Very large house.  No other servants?
I'm not sure. I've never seen anyone.
Mr. Twain asked me to see that you're
made most comfortable,
and to say that he will be joining you
after dinner.
After dinner?  Host not have dinner
with guests?
No.
Mr. Twain prefers to eat out.
Oh, wait please!  What that?
That? Oh, it's nothing, sir. Just the cat.
That, cat?
You feed cat dog food?
I'm afraid he's a very angry cat, sir.
Mr. Twain had him "fixed", and he
didn't want to be.
Big house. Eh, Pop?
Big house like man married to fat woman.
Hard to get around.
Ah! Here we are.
I'm sure you'll find this suitable.
Oh, it's a cold house!
I've taken care of that, sir.
You'll find a nice cosy fire in your room.
It's a bit smoky, sir. I'm afraid that
old fireplace
hasn't been used in years.
At least the bed will be warm.
If you wish anything, sir, please ring.
Why bother?
It's... behind the bed, sir. There.
Ah!
Dinner will be at 9, and Mr. Twain
likes his guests to dress.
Ah! The doorbell. Excuse me.
Wow! What a creepy guy!
Why would anyone want to hire a blind butler?
For one thing, very cheap.
How butler know how much he get paid?
Here, drink this darling. You'll feel better.
If Miron hadn't barked when he did,
we never would have seen that statue falling.
I don't think that statue was meant to kill us,
darling. I think it was a warning.
Somebody's trying to frighten us. But why?
Whatever his reason is, he's doing a
wonderful job.
And why the devil hasn't anybody answered
this door?
Don't ring it again, Dicky!
Knock, don't ring.
I won't. I promise.
What is it now, Miron?
Up there, Dora, look!
A blind butler!
Don't let him park the car, Dicky!
Good evening. We have been expecting you.
We let ourselves in, thank you.
I'm... Dick and Dora Charleston.
Good evening. We have been expecting you.
Your room is ready, if you'll just
follow me, please.
Don't mind him, ma'am. It's just the cat.
Oh yes... our luggage, in the trunk.
I'll get it later, ma'am...
when I park the car.
Was that Mr. Wang's car I noticed out front?
Yes. They're resting now in their room.
I have taken the liberty of putting you
in the same wing as Mr. Wang.
Oh, isn't that nice, darling.
We're in Wang's wing!
Not many people come to the manor these days.
It's nice to hear guests again.
Oh, thank you... you are?
- Benson, ma'am
- Thank you, Benson.
No, no, no... "Besonmum".
My name is Bensonmum.
- Besonmum?
- Yessir. Jamessir Bensonmum.
Jamessir?
Yessir
- Jamessir Bensonmum?
- Yessir
- How odd!
- My father's name sir!
What was your father's name?
Howard. Howard Bensonmum.
Your father was "How odd" Bensonmum?
Leave it be Dicky, I've had enough.
Ah, here were are.
The late Mrs. Twain's room.
She died in here.
- Oh dear!
- Died of what?
She murdered herself in her sleep, sir.
You mean suicide?
Oh, no. It was murder alright.
Mrs. Twain hated herself.
We keep this room locked.
Why is that?
Mr. Twain loved her very much.
He's kept her room
just as it was the night she choked herself...
...nine years ago.
Madam loved it here.
She said it was the cheeriest room
in the house.
Ah! The doorbell.
That was Mrs. Charleston.
I thought she was up here with us, sir.
I am, and I will not stay in this...
horribly filthy room overnight!
Filthy? Very well madam.
I'll attend to it during dinner.
Thank you Bensonsir.
- Mum!
- What?
Bensonmum.
ma'am?
Baking flour!
What?
This dust is baking flour.
And these cobwebs, candied sugar.
All placed here recently
for the sole purpose of frightening us.
And that mouse...
...obviously a mechanical toy.
- Silly...
- What is?
I am.
It's real!
Stop the car. We are here.
I know we are here.
That's why I stopped the car!
Open my door.
- You've chocolate on your face.
- What?
The candy bar, it is all over your face.
- Imbecile, that's my moustache!
- Lick it and see!
Wipe it off, my hands are sticky.
Hold still please!
Sloppy!
All in good time!
Yes?
Who's there?
Who's there, I say?
Filthy neighbourhood!
Didn't I say "jump"?
Un, deux, trois, "jump", I say?
Why don't you listen to me?
- Oh, leave me alone...
- Sloppy!
Who are you?
You must be the new kitchen maid.
I hope you can cook. Um?
Answer me... Speak up!
What's that?  I can't hear you.
A little shy are you? Never mind.
There will be 10 for dinner.
Here is the menu.
Is that understood?  Dinner will be at 9.
When I want you, that bell
on the wall will ring 3 times.
All right.  Get to work.
Allo!  Allo, allo!
Operator!
I am saying allo, allo!
- It's dead, sir.
- What?...
Who is? Who are you?
The butler, sir.
The butler, eh?  I thought as much.
That phone has been out of order
for the past week, sir.
Is that a fact?
And I put it to you that this wire
has been snipped not one hour ago.
As you can plainly see.
What is your name?
Benson-mum
Your little jest escapes me.
I am Monsieur Milo Perrier.
My chauffeur was injured by a falling gargoyle
while standing outside your Chinese footprints.
We rang the bell. A woman screamed.
A mouse ran by us through the door.
As you can plainly see... I miss nothing.
Since we cannot call for a doctor, I will
need a cold compress for my chauffeur...
...and a cup of hot chocolate for me.
N'est-ce pas?
I don't think we have Nespa, sir.
Just Hershey's.
I'll call the maid.
I'll fetch it for you myself, sir.
In the meantime, if you'll be good enough
to follow me to your room.
Get up, get up!
There is something about this butler
I do not trust.
Notice how his eyes never look at you.
He's blind, monsieur!
Nonsense!
Here's the house now.
What's the matter?
My feet are killing me!
Why didn't you tell me we needed oil
before I went back for the gas, Sam?
Because I gave you a 50 dollar bill and
the gas was only 5 bucks.
Maybe you'd come back, maybe you wouldn't.
I couldn't take that chance, angel.
Don't you trust me, Sam?
Trust you?
The last time that I trusted a dame
was in Paris in 1940.
She said she was going out to get a
bottle of wine.
Two hours later, the Germans marched
into France.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sam.
Sorry nothing.  Give me my change.
Dinner will be at 9, sir.  I'll have the
maid bring up your chocolate.
- Oh, one moment, my good man.
- Sir?
Thank you. That will be all.
He's blind all right.
Those were my funniest faces.
Not exactly the Copa Cabana, is it?
I don't feel good about this, Sam...
Maybe tonight's the night your luck runs out.
Maybe so.
There's a number on the wall for all
of us, angel,
and if tonight's the night they pick mine,
so be it.
After you, sweetheart.
First kiss me, Sam.
I don't kiss.
Just this once, Sam?
I don't like kissing. Now leave me alone!
My God! He's dead!
I beg your pardon?
Sam Diamond, the man I work for, is lying
out there. He's been crushed to death!
Ah! I'm gonna faint! You catch me!
Madam!
Madam, where are you?
All right, hold it right there!
Freeze, winky! Get your hands up!
Turn your face to the wall!
All right angel, you can get up now.
Turn around, please.
Your concrete Christmas present arrived
about 2 seconds early.
No thanks to you.
I apologize for any unfortunate mishap, sir.
May I put my hands down?
Don't chase your luck, Shakespeare.
I got your little invitation to dinner...
...but I didn't realize I was gonna be
the main course.
I had a kid brother who got it the same way,
workin' on a case just like this 2 years ago.
That boy would've been 63 on Tuesday.
- For 2 cents I'd like to take a shot...
- Sam, let go
Get him away from me!
Get him away...
Get him away before I stuff him
like one of them tiger trophies
that our slimy pals like to hang
up on saloon walls.
Please!
He has a dreadful temper, hasn't he?
9 o'clock!  Time for dinner!
Is everything ready?
I don't smell anything. Very light
on the seasoning, are you?
Put the soup in the tureen and keep the
squabs on the low flame.
I'll server cocktails.
When you hear the bell...
...bring out the chilled asparagus, and
turn up the flame on the squabs.
Have you got that?
You didn't tell me how I look, Dicky.
(...) Absolutely ravishing!
Do you love me and adore me?
I love you and adore you.
You too have the best "tush" in high society.
Years of horseback riding, darling.
Getting to bottom of things, Charleston?
- Ah, Wang!  Darling you remember...
- Of course. Nice to see you Ah-Wang!
Always a pleasure, Mrs. Charleston.
What a beautiful gown... You must tell me
where you got it!
This?  Oh, this an old dress...
Had it for years!
Please to meet adopted son, Willie.
Ah! East meets West in a most bizarre setting.
- Perrier!
- Charleston.
I didn't know you were invited!
You know Wang?
Ah, yes! I had the pleasure of dining in
Shanghai many years ago with Inspector Wang.
Oh, you remember! Yes!
You had Hong Ching Choo, and I had
Cow Dung Wu Tan!
My wife, Dora.  Inspector Perrier.
Très charmante!
I'm sorry, our room is so dusty.
My fault, I should have blown first.
May I present my secretaire/chauffeur,
Marcel Cassette.
Recovered from your accident, Marcel?
Oui, monsieur, but...
how did you know?
From the way you bend.
The right side of your body's smashed in
by a Citroen, I imagine.
I also thought I detected a slightly
metallic sound,
which leads me to believe you've had an
artificial hip put in. Steel?
Aluminium.  You're as quick as ever, Charleston.
And you, Mr. Charleston, did not approve
of Mrs. Charleston...
...dying hair blond?
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Charleston hair red.
You have blond hairs on shoulder.
That means she has died red hair to blond,
and back again to red,
or else, you have been...
Oh! So sorry! Wang is... wrong.
Shall we go to dinner?
- Well, Pop, you sure pushed your...
- Shut Japanese mouth!
Must have been ghastly to have your
hip removed.
- Does it hurt?
- It only hurts in damp weather...
- Are you all right?
- Pay no attention. You'll only spoil him.
Get up, get up!
- As I was saying, Mr. Charleston,...
- Hey, Pop!
- A treacherous road like fresh mushrooms...
- Hey Pop, uh...
I know. Dog stick tongue out of picture.
Treacherous road like...
He's a charming fellow...
African death mask. Died in some tribal
ritual, I should think.
Wonder where others are?
Others? What others?
Invitation to dinner and murder finally
clear to Wang
with appearance of Monsieur Perrier.
It is obvious, that only the world's
greatest living detectives
are on the guest list.
Five of us, to be exact, darling.
Three are already here.
Two have not yet arrived,
Miss Jessie Marbles of England,
- And Mr...
- Sam Diamond of San Francisco.
I know who you all are.
The lady here in the rented dress is
my secretary and mistress,
Miss Tess Skeffington.
Ah, Sam, don't...
Oh I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Miss Skeffington doesn't like it when
I'm so brutally honest.
But then again, we're all in a brutal
business. Aren't we gentlemen?
Never considered murder to be...
..."business", Mr. Diamond.
Is that right, Mr. Wang?
Well, maybe not for you, seein' as how
you put all your money into vegetables
back in the late 30's.
Maybe our friends here don't know that you
own over 50% of the bean sprout
and the bamboo shoots grown on the
Chinese mainland?
So you folks can imagine how much
Chicken Charmaine goes
into Mr. Wang's pot each year.
Am I gettin' those figures right, Angel?
Right, Sam.
I don't see what this has to do with anything.
Or you, Mr. Perrier.
You work both sides of the big drink.
Pretty good pickings over there solving
crimes for them Barons and Earls
and putting your fancy fees into private
and Swiss banks.
Three trips a year buys a lot of hot chocolate,
don't it Frenchie?
Now see here, Diamond!
No, you see here, Mr. Charleston of New York,
Palm Beach and Beverly Hills.
Crime is just a hobby to you, isn't it?
It's just a little game to while away
the time
while you're waitin' for room service
in some fancy hotel.
While your wife's family dough buys your
Gin-Martinis and your $300 suits.
It's a pretty nice arrangement when all you gotta do
is give your wife a little grab every now and then.
And take the dog for a leak twice a day.
Sorry if I'm shocking you ma'am, but I never
had time to go to finishing school.
My school is the streets,
and looking down the barrel of a pointed
revolver is my teacher.
I get $50 a day in expenses when I can
get them, gentlemen.
And I owe Miss Skeffington here 3 years and
2 months back pay. Ain't that right, Angel?
I don't care about the money, Sam.
Neither do I.
Now if one of you, gentlemen,
would be so kind as to
give my lady friend here a glass of
cheap white wine?
I'm goin' down the hall to find the can.
I talk so much sometimes, I forget to go.
Please excuse Sam. He was shot in the head
last week.
He shouldn't be even out of the hospital.
If you ask me, I think the fellow's
pretty damned honest.
Dicky! Language!
Miss Jessica Marbles, and Nurse.
Ah, Miss Marbles! So we finally meet.
Have admired you ever since I was
tiny little detective.
Thank you Mr. Wang.
I... am Jessica Marbles,
this is Miss Withers. My Nurse.
She's been with me 52 years.
I have to take care of the poor dear now.
- Are you all right, Miss Withers?
- Hmm.
- Do you want your medicine now?
- No.
She's off.  I could use a good,
stiff shot, Mr. Charleston.
I believe the "booze", as you call it,
is your department.
My pleasure, Madam.
Who is the old (geisha)?
Sam!
Jessie, baby!
Sam Diamond!
Mr. Diamond, you have a bullet hole
in your back!
You should see the other guy!
Quiet, please!
Observe! Strange sound.
Aaaaargh!
My God! It's the face! It's coming
from the face!
Aaaaargh!
Acts like he's going through his final
moments of death!
What could it mean?
It means dinner, sir.  We have no gong.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
to make a toast.
Our host, Mr. Lionel Twain is indeed a most...
...unique man.
Point 1: He has succeeded in gathering
the world's 5 greatest detectives...
...to investigate a crime that has
not yet been committed.
Point 2: He has set traps for us,
a bridge that almost collapses,
falling statues...
Does he mean to kill us?
Certainly not yet, he could have done that
at any time.
He's merely trying to wet our appetites
for the game that is to follow.
Point 3: Why 5 detectives instead of 1?
Because he intends to take us all on,
ladies and gentlemen.
A feat that no criminal mind has
heretofore attempted.
Therefore, before this hellish weekend begins,
I propose that we raise our wine glasses
in a toast to either the most...
...beguiling and charming man,
or to an insidious, fiendish, madman!
Bottoms up!
One moment, please!
Point 4:
Wine poisoned!
What?
An ancient, tasteless, colourless and
odourless oriental herb...
...that kills instantly.
Observe, please.
Great Scott! Mr. Wang, you saved our lives!
Not quite, Mrs. Charleston.
Bon apétit!
Since Monsieur Wang was the only one who
could detect such a poison,
he was the only one who was tested.
Point 5: Monsieur Twain is both beguiling,
and fiendish.
Oh, get a doctor, quick!
No, no... it's I.
My wine is not poisoned.
It was just a bad year...
Good work, Mr. Wang.
We must all be on our guard through
every course of the meal.
You're all forgettin' one thing.
This makes the butler pretty suspicious,
since he's the one who poured the wine.
Except for the fact that he is blind.
How would he know which one to server
the poisoned glass to?
That's very simple.
Blind people have a very keen
sense of smell.
Since we're all Anglo-Saxon and Mr. Wang's
son is Japanese,
it wouldn't be hard to sniff out the Chinaman.
Now see here, Diamond. That's a pretty
tacky thing to say, isn't it?
Well it's a pretty tacky world, Mr. Charleston.
- Ain't that right, Angel?
- That's right, Sam.
Quiet, please. Butler approaches.
I apologise for the delay.
I seem to be having some communication
problems with the cook.
Who poured the wine?
Mr. Twain, sir.
It was left for me on a tray in the
refrigerator.
I was told to give Mr. Wang the glass
with the sticky stem.
And you didn't bother to ask why?
I was lucky to find the refrigerator, sir.
If I may serve the soup now?
By all means.
Ah, yes, I'm famished.
One moment...
Where's the soup?
In your dish, sir.
There is nothing in my dish...
but my dish.
I don't understand, sir.
Here, take the spoon. Taste it for yourself.
I see what you mean, sir.
If you'll excuse me, I intend to have a
little talk with the cook.
Murder by starvation. Maybe that's
his game. Hm?
What do you think, Sam?
I don't know Jess. Why don't you ask
the moose on the wall.
He's been watchin' us since we came in.
Ten people for dinner, and I'm serving them
hot nothing!
You can't get good help today.
You're fired, you understand? Fired!
I want you out, do you hear? Out!
And stay out!
Something has occurred to me.
The seating's all wrong!
How so, Mr. Charleston?
I'm sitting next to Dora.
What's wrong with that? She's your wife,
isn't she?
Exactly! But in a proper dinner party, the
husband is never seated next to the wife.
Actually I should be on the opposite side
of the table.
Mr. Wang, will you change places with me?
Now, Mr. Charleston?
Now, Mr. Wang.
Just as I thought!
Another test that could have cost us
our lives.
Saved only by the fact that I am
enormously well-bred.
Lucky it wasn't me. I'd be chopped
liver by now.
Silence, please!  Do not panic!
No person move from place!
Someone just came into the room.
I hear footsteps!
Oh, no!
Quiet, everyone!
I smell something!
What is it?
Good God! Franks and beans!
I'm afraid that's all we have, sir.
Dicky, don't. You know how I get
when you touch me there.
Not me, darling, I've got my hands
in my pockets.
I'm afraid they're my pockets!
Oh, sorry about that.
Dicky, behave yourself!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I'm your host, Lionel Twain.
Good God! What an entrance!
A bit theatrical, Miss Marbles.
But I do so love illusion.
Please forgive my hat. I'm losing my hair.
I thought Twain was an older man.
Say 72, 73.
76 to be exact, Mr. Diamond.
How do I look so young? Quite simple.
Complete vegetable diet, 12 hours sleep
at night,
and lots and lots of makeup.
I trust you've all been made comfortable.
Comfortable, Mr. Twain?
You call poisoned wine and near-decapitation
comfortable?
No, I call it inspiration.
You still have not explained the various mechanical and culinary attempts
on our lives, Monsieur Twain.
Merely games, Monsieur Perrier.
Pitting wits with you, so to speak.
You pit your wits with me, little man,
and you won't have your wits to pit with.
- Know what I mean?
- Sam, you're spitting on the nurse.
Sorry, old lady. This crazy broad should
be in bed.
Monsieur Twain, we have been here nearly 4 hours,
and there has not been a hint of a hot dinner,
or cold corpse.
I must therefore bid you adieu.
I bid one adieu as well.
No one is leaving this house.
What meaning of this, Mr. Twain?
I will tell you, Mr. Wang, if you
can tell me
why a man who possesses one of the most brilliant minds of this century
can't say his prepositions or articles.
"The", Mr. Wang.
What is "the" meaning of this.
That what I said! What meaning of this?
The meaning of this is, that I have decided
to prove
beyond the shadow of a doubt
that the greatest living criminologist
in the world
is sitting at this table
and you are all looking at him.
No, don't look at each other! Look at me!
I'm the greatest! I'm number 1!
To me you look number 2. Know what I mean?
What does he mean, Miss Skeffington?
I'll tell you later. It's disgusting.
In all your various adventures, Monsieurs et Mesdames,
not one of you has had an unsolved murder.
Your reputations exist on this single fact.
But...
...what would the world say, if the five
greatest living detectives,
...found themselves trapped in a country
house in the weekend,
...shut off from the outside world,
...only to discover a dead body
on the floor,
...stabbed 12 times in the back with a
butcher's knife, and...
...not one of you able to solve the crime?
You mean murder?
Dora, please, we're talking shop.
Yes, murder, Mrs. Charleston.
On the stroke of midnight,
someone in this house is going to be
viciously murdered.
Left out one small detail Mr. Twain.
Who victim?
"is the"... "is the"...
"Who is the victim"!
That drives me crazy!
Sounds like a short ride to me.
Does it, Mr. Diamond? Well,
we shall see who is sane
and who is crazy around here.
The victim is here at this very table
at this very moment.
And so too, ladies and gentlemen,
is the murderer.
Murder-poo?
Yes, dear. We're going to have a lovely
murder-poo.
Why don't you push her wheelchair down
the driveway? We got business here.
You say you know who's gonna get it?
Intimately.
And you know how the crime is
to be committed?
Definitely.
And exactly what time murder
to take place?
"The" murder!  Precisely.
Well, I know that it's none of my business,
but doesn't that mean that you're
the murderer, Mr. Twain?
No wives. I refuse to discuss this with wives.
Dora is quite right. All fingers do seem
to point at you.
It's not much of a challenge, I'd say.
Shall I make it more interesting,
Mr. Charleston?
1 million dollars to the one who solves
the crime,
wagered against your reputations.
1 million dollars in tax-free cash.
In addition, all the paperback rights
and the film sales.
It's 11 o'clock amigos.
Just 1 hour before death strikes someone
in this room.
See you at midnight.  Too-de-loo!
See here, Mr. Twain...
Look, he's gone!
No he's not. He's down there!
Fast little bunny rabbit, ain't ya?
I've never moved, Mr. Diamond.
I'm still down there.
A little stuff done with mirrors.
Is that so?
Willing to risk seven years bad luck?
Try it, Mr. Diamond.
It's your funeral, butter balls.
Wait, wait!
Sometimes it doesn't work.
You won this round, Mr. Diamond.
My turn comes at midnight.
I hope he knows how to stop that thing.
If you ask me, anybody that offers a million bucks
to solve a crime that ain't been committed yet
has got a lot more upstairs than his hair.
What do we all do now? Just sit around
and wait for one of us to be butchered?
And what has happened to the butler?
Why has he not returned?
With our dinner!
- Go look for him.
- Oui, monsieur.
No!
- No one to leave this room!
- Why not, Pop?
Twain say victim at this table.
If we all stay together,
crime cannot be committed without
witnesses.
He's right. You're one smart Chinaman,
Mr. Wang.
I suggest we all join hands. The chain is
stronger if the links are unbroken.
Join hands, please.
Stop that!
Stop it, I said.
What is it, Diamond?
The nurse is giving my palm the finger,
the dirty old broad!
Naughty, naughty Miss Withers!
Good God!
What is it?
Look!
What is she doing?
I think she's screaming.
What is it? What's happened?
Something wrong in kitchen.
With our dinner!
Patience, patience!
Is someone in there?
Someone in the kitchen with dinner?
Cook cannot speak or hear!
I think butler is dead.
My name is Yatta. I don't work Thursdays.
Ask her if she sleeps in, Dicky.
We must investigate this, Wang.
Someone has to go.
Not alone. Mr Charleston, Mr. Diamond,
stay with others.
Miss Marble, Mr. Perrier and Wang,
we'll investigate.
That's right, just let it all out.
Here...
Damn!
Careful, Wang!
Huh?
Fingerprints!
Huh?
Yours!
Here, take my handkerchief.
Is he.. ?
He look like...
Seems like...
Fingerprints!
Good thought.
- Pencil.
- Pencil.
No pulse...
no heartbeat.
If condition does not change,
this man...
...is dead!
No signs of foul play.
Hold on!
What's this?
What do you make of this, Perrier?
Poison, n'est-ce pas?
Not Nespa, Coco!
So at last, we have our murder!
Not quite. Twain say murder victim sitting
at our table.
Butler not at our table.
Butler only killed to divert us from...
...real murder still to come.
One of the knives is missing!
The butcher's knife, I'll wager.
Which means the others are still in danger.
What is exact time, please?
Yes, yes.
11:31 and 56 seconds.
57
58
Tell me when to stop.
59
60
28 minutes to main murder!
Quickly, back to dining room.
Must all be together at midnight.
One moment!
Handkerchief!
What is it?
A bill. Everything here has been arranged
for tonight.
The butler, the cook, the food,
the dining room chairs, everything!
You mean...?
Yes, this entire murder has been...
...catered!
It's Twain's doing. The man is mad.
Ah, yes, but no fool. I only hope we are
in time.
Door locked!
Sam Diamond probably locked it from
the inside as a precaution.
Good thinking on Diamond head.
Diamond, it's Perrier.
It's all right... open up!
Diamond, Charleston, are you in there?
Quickly! Go back to kitchen. Get dining
room key from pocket of dead butler.
You don't have to say dead butler,
it's bad enough I have to put my hand
in his pocket!
Holy merde!
Miss Skeffington!
Miss Skeffington! Miss Withers!
He's gone!
- Who's gone?
- The butler.
His body is missing. Here's the key.
If butler gone, where you find key?
In his pocket.
- What pocket?
- The butler's pocket.
Butler gone but pocket still there?
Exactly. Somebody has stolen his body but
left his clothes there.
Quickly, open the door. Something is
very wrong here.
Hello? Where is everyone?
Room filled with empty people!
I'll try the other door.
It's locked. From the inside!
Strange... Both doors locked from inside,
yet no way out!
I don't like it. I don't like it one bit!
I like it, but do not understand it.
Maybe other way out of room.
Secret passageway perhaps.
Wrong there are no secret passageways,
Mr. Wang.
You spoke?
- No.
- Not me.
I spoke!
Ah, there!
Voice come from cow on wall!
Moose! Moose, you imbecile!
Where are they? What have you done
with the others, you short madman?
Ah-ha! Stumped already!
Need some clues Mr. Perrier?
Clues? I need no clues from you! I find
my own clues, you demented lollypop!
Calm yourself! Man who argue with cow
on wall is like train without wheels.
Very soon get nowhere.
OK, quiet. I'm sick of your
fortune cookies.
- Oh, man who is sick of Chinese cookie, is like...
- Didnt he hear what I said?
- Quiet, quiet, please
- Cow talk again!
In need of a hint, Miss Marbles?
You all mistake what you assume,
they never left the dining room.
Count the numbers one to ten,
turn the knob and try again.
What the devil does that mean?
"They never left the dining room",
Certainly they did!
Do not mistake what you assume,
Miss Marble.
Quick, back out in hall!
What for?
We assume others not here, but cow say
they are in dining room.
Let us look once more.
Please close door, Mr. Perrier.
- I cannot see what possible...
- Please, be quiet
...seven...eight...nine...ten
Miss Marbles, be so kind as to open door,
please.
Where were you, Wang? We was worried.
What do you mean, where were we?
Where were you?
We were here. Didn't you say not
to leave the dining room?
And you have not left this room
since we were gone?
Certainly not!
Answer simple... but question very hard.
Where's the butler?
Butler completely murdered.
Poisoned. Yet one of the butcher's knives
is missing.
We came back here to inform you, but the
doors were locked!
I went back to get the key out of the
butler's pocket.
His body was missing.
He had been stripped naked,
and his clothes left in his place.
I don't understand. Why would anybody want
to steal a dead, naked body?
Dear, there are people who...
That's tacky!
That's really tacky!
Then we returned here, opened the door,
but the room was empty,
you were all gone!
The moose head told us not to assume,
that you had ever left the dining room.
So, we counted to 10,
and tried it again.
And here you were!
I'm not one to use hyperbolae,
ladies and gentlemen,
but I'll tell you this:
For the first time in my life
I had the caca scared out of me!
I like her, I really like her!
- Gunshots, Monsieur!
- Gunshots, Pop!
- Gunshots, Sam!
- Gunshots, Dicky!
All right, this time Charleston
and I will go.
Everybody else stay in the room.
Let's go, Charleston.
What do you make of all of this, Wang?
Is confusing.
"It"! "It" is confusing.
Say your goddamn pronouns!
Open the door.
Good God!
What is it?
He's back!
And au naturel!
I don't get it.
First they steal the body and leave
the clothes,
then they steal the clothes and
bring the body back.
Who would do a thing like that?
Possibly some deranged dry-cleaner.
What about the gunshots?
Why shoot some poor slob when he's
already been poisoned?
True. We heard the gunshots.
But I don't see any bullet hole on his head, his neck,
his back or his chest.
Look all over him.
All over his body?
Somebody's gotta do it.
I'm busy standing guard.
Why don't I stand guard.
You look all over the body.
All right, we'll take turns.
You look over the first dead naked body
that we find
and I'll look over the second.
Hurry up, we only got 8 minutes.
You see anythin'?
No, I don't see a bullet hole anywhere.
Hold it! I see something.
What is it?
Forget it. My mistake. Not a bullet hole.
If he wasn't mugged, what about the shots?
- Divide and Conquer.
- What?
Another diversion. He gives us
meaningless clues to confuse us
dangles red herrings before our eyes,
but dazzles us with bizarre banalities,
but all the time
precious seconds are ticking away
towards a truly terrible murder still
to come.
You're good, Charleston.
You're not my kindda cop, but you're smart
and you smell good.
You're not a pransy, I know that.
But what the hell are you?
Classy, I suppose.
Dames always fall for a guy like you,
don't they?
- I don't see what possibly interests...
- Did you even make it with a waitress?
I beg your pardon?
A waitress. A big, fat waitress.
I don't know what them society dames are
like in a kip,
but you ain't never had it till you've
made it with a big, fat, blonde waitress.
If you're ever interested,
you give me a call.
Bizarre little twit.
Still not sure about this guy.
What're you doin'?
- I'd wash my hands after, em...
- Good
I'll be out in a minute.
I'll go ahead. I'll tell the others.
You're never gonna believe this, folks...
All right, where are you?
What the hell is goin' on here?
Charleston, wash up later.
We got problems.
Locked from the inside.
That can only mean one thing!
And I dunno what it is...
Charleston!
You're never gonna believe...
I said I'd be out in a minute!
I don't remember closin' that door.
What happened?
What with the gunshots?
Did anybody leave this room
since we were gone?
So it happened to you too, Mr. Diamond.
Where's my Dicky?
Sorry, where's my husband?
Two minutes to midnight, in case
anyone is interested.
It ain't possible, I'm tellin' you!
Eight people in a dining room,
can't turn into an empty room unless...
Unless what, Sam?
Unless it never happened.
I see your point, Diamond!
When is a dining room filled with people
not a dining room filled with people?
When this is 2 dining rooms!
Exactly.
Two dining rooms?
Two dining rooms, two of everything.
Twain electronic genius!
He has devised a way to move this room
quickly and silently,
in the flash of an eye,
to be replaced by an exact duplicate
of this very room.
I knew it all the time!
Oh, please.
I shall demonstrate.
I shall walk out the door, close it,
knock 3 times,
enter, and you will all be gone.
Observe.
I have it all figured out.
There are two of everything.
Oh, Dicky, that's old news.
All right, everybody take their seats.
I'm scared, Sam. Hold me.
Hold yourself, I'm busy.
Take the same seats you had before.
40 seconds! I'm very worried about Mr. Perrier.
I'm going to look for him.
No, sit please. No one to leave room.
It's the other door.
It's locked. I can't open it.
Hurry, man. We have 15 seconds.
Move your hands, chauffeur.
Don't ask me!
What are you doing in the butler's uniform?
I said don't ask me!
I don't know... It all happened too quickly.
The cook! Where's the cook?
She's gone! Never said a word.
10 more seconds! Quickly,
sit and join hands!
Impossible for murder to happen now,
without witnesses.
3... 2... 1
It's over.
We're safe and sound.
That's probably the cook... Come in!
- Darling, the poor woman is stone deaf.
- I'm sorry, I forgot.
Come in!
Not sound like cook to me.
Ah, Mr. Twain.
You appear to be wrong.
Nobody here murdered. Please to come in.
Is he dead?
With a thing like that in his back,
in the long run he's better off.
Touch nothing!
Will you stop saying touch nothing?
We're all experienced criminologists.
I find it insulting, debasing and redundant
to keep telling us to touch nothing!
- Oh, be quiet, woman.
- Up yours, fella!
Most amusing! Bickering detectives like making
giant lamb soup,
everything go to pot!
- Why don't you...
- Be quiet...
All right, all of you. Nobody move!
Stay where you are, everybody!
What is it?
I have to go to the can again.
I don't wanna miss nothin'.
I'm going too, Sam.
I rather do this alone, Tess.
Thanks anyway.
The cook!
What, darling?
Well, it's obvious. The cook murdered him.
The butler's dead. All the rest of us
were in this room, except for her.
No one else could get in or out, so
that only leaves the cook.
Isn't that right?
Wrong.
Oh? What makes you certain of this, Diamond?
To drive a knife that far a man's back
you need a powerful right arm.
And this arm don't look that strong to me.
Is that the cook's arm?
It ain't the pussycat's tail, lady.
Don't be alarmed, miss. It ain't real.
For that matter, neither is the cook.
I found this before I got to the can.
Another surprise for you folks.
A mannequin!
No...
a dummy.
Perfect in every detail, with the exception of
not being able to make her hear or speak.
My hats off to the man with the stab
in his back.
Except for the fact that he's dead,
he was no dope.
Nice going, Sam.
I hope you all realise that
someone in this room is a murderer.
For sake of ladies present,
may I suggest we all return to drawing room.
My son will cover up remains of Mr. Twain.
Why do I do all the dirty work, Pop?
'Cause your mother not here to do it.
Come, please.
- Give me the bottle, Sam.
- Excuse me.
I'm getting a headache, Dicky.
Isn't there some way of turning off that
ridiculous machine?
Maybe some gadget outside the window.
I'm sorry, darling. It's raining this time.
I suggest we get down to business
and show the facts.
It is now 12:30 Sunday morning.
The doors and windows will automatically
open at dawn,
and one of us here will be 1 million dollars
richer,
and one of us will be going to the
gas chamber, to be hung.
One, monsieur Perrier?
One or two. We all have associates.
Why not 4 or 6 or 8?
I don't trust any of you.
Maybe I'm just a patsy being set up
to take the fall,
but I'm not falling for any of this.
You understand?
Not even me, Sam?
Why don't you fall in love with the
Jap kid and get off my back?
Can we get back to case, please?
Time is late, and my eyes are getting tired.
I thought they always look like that.
Knock it off, Sam!
I apologise. This case is gettin' on
my nerves.
I'm sorry, (Snydie).
Thank you. Now then.. Facts, please, facts.
Mr. Twain predicts murder. Also predicts
victim to be at dining table. Correct?
Correct.
I'm sorry, darling, this is official. Correct.
Also predicts murder to take place at midnight.
And predicts number of stab wounds.
How can this be if he not in collaboration
with murderer?
What if Twain did it himself?
Murdered himself?
For what possible reason?
And how?
The motive is simple: Ego.
If we were not to solve this crime, he would
indeed be named the world's foremost detective.
And with an ego like his, the fact that he
had to die for it would be a small price to pay.
As to how.. Any man who can create this
chamber of electronic marvels
could certainly be able to devise a machine that
would stab himself in the back 11 or 12 times.
That was wonderful, darling. I'm so proud
of you. Let's go to bed, quickly.
One moment, please.
Very interesting theory, Mr. Charleston,
but you overlook one very important point.
And that is?
Is stupid!
Is most stupid theory I every heard!
Do you have a better one?
Oh, yes, much better one.
You see, I have been doing my homework,
Mr. Charleston.
For example, I have information
that your wife's portfolio of stocks
was seriously depleted in latest
financial crisis.
In short, you are flat broke, Mr. Charleston.
You have been borrowing money for over
2 years,
at 17% interest,
from Mr. Lionel Twain.
Broke? Dicky, is this true?
I didn't want to tell you now, darling,
I was
saving it for your birthday.
1 million dollars would buy
great many tight suits,
would it not, Mr. Charleston?
Now, see here, Wang!
Dead broke, Dicky?
Almost, darling.
I have $1.17 and some stamps.
But I did not murder Lionel Twain.
Now you do believe that, don't you darling?
We'll talk. We'll see.
It could've been any one of you.
Each and every one of us was out of that
dining room at one time or another,
giving ample opportunity to commit the crime.
As for motives, there's more than ego
and cash involved.
For example, revenge.
Meaning what, Mr. Charleston?
Meaning that I'm not the only one here who's
had a past experience with Mr. Twain.
Did you know that he was quite a
lady's man in his day?
Are you suggesting that someone here...
Was at one time in love with Lionel Twain!
As a matter of fact, he was engaged to,
and jilted...
Miss Jessica Marbles!
Mon Dieu!
Jesus H. Christ!
Jilted 54 years ago at the altar.
Left her there in that same baggy
tweed outfit.
Is this true, Jessie?
I was not jilted. I walked out on him.
He wanted to fool around before the wedding.
And being the lady you are, you refused.
Not completely.
But it got out of hand.
He was horrid, but I didn't kill him.
That's good enough for me.
What about you, Frenchie?
I'm not a Frenchie! I'm a Belgie!
I guess there are other motives.
How about patricide?
The killing of one's own parent?
You mean that Lionel Twain was the father
of someone in this room?
He wasn't my father.
He was my uncle.
He was very good to me. He would take me
to the circus and give me candy.
We stopped going when I was about...
26.
I'm sorry, Sam.
26!
What the hell kind of a circus was it?
Forgive me, but I was talking about
patricide.
Not "unclecide".
Mr. Twain may have been your uncle,
Miss Skeffington,
but he was the illegitimate father of...
Mr. Sydney Wang!
It's not true!
I was adopted.
I have my papers.
That is why I have adopted
all my children.
I was wondering.
He loved me very much. But he was...
not very observant.
One day, when I was 19,
he called me to his study,
noticed for first time I was oriental,
and kicked me out of house!
- I could have...
- Killed him! Mr. Wang.
As easily as you, Mr. Perrier.
Lionel Twain killed only thing
you ever loved,
Marie-Louise Cartier.
Your sweetheart?
My poodle.
He was a most cruel man.
Mr. Twain would come to France
every season,
to hunt poodles.
The day they brought her
bloodied sequent collar to me,
I vowed one day I would...
Knock him off?
Yes, gladly, if I had the chance.
But I did not.
Someone here beat me to it.
So there's more than one reason that
we was invited here.
Not only was Twain testin' our skills
as detectives,
but we all have legitimate motives for
doin' the old man in.
Have not yet heard your motive,
Mr. Diamond.
My motive is unimportant.
Let's just say that I hated him enough
to kill him.
You are closed man, Mr. Diamond.
You hide many things.
Could it be that Mr. Twain discover
your secret?
I dunno what you're talkin' about.
We know different, do we not,
Miss Skeffington.
Twain picked up Sam in a gay bar.
I was workin' on a case! Working!
Every night for 6 months?
I got 50 bucks a day in expenses!
I hate them queeries.
Twain had Polaroid pictures of
Sam in Drag...
I was in disguise! Lots of dames
go in those joints.
I never kissed nobody.
And I never did nothin' to a man
that I wouldn't do to a woman.
And I didn't kill Twain.
Bitch!
Most interesting.
All had perfect motives for killing Twain.
Wonder which one was one who done it?
We still have the night to get through.
If any one is going to solve this case,
I say we all get a good night's sleep.
And I suggest we all lock our doors.
One of us is a mad killer,
not to be trusted.
Pop?
Yeah?
Who do you think is the murderer?
Must sleep on it.
Will know in morning when wake up.
What if you don't wake up?
Then you dead.
Go sleep, please.
Good night, dad.
Shut up, adopted pussycat.
Shall I turn off the steam, Pop?
Not steam.
Someone just put...
deadly snake in room.
Wake me when it come near bed.
I want you to know, Dicky darling,
that if you're the murderer,
I'll still love you.
I don't think it would be right
for us to make love.
But I'd still love you.
No fear of that, my pet.
Now let's see what we have here.
We have one missing, dead, naked butler,
one host with a butcher's knife in his back,
and one poisonous scorpion crawling up
our sheets.
Is that what that is?
Yes, they can kill instantly.
I suggest we don't move.
For how long?
Quite possibly for the rest of our lives.
Good heavens! I know who the murderer is!
Solvie-poo?
Yes, Miss Withers, the murderer is...
Good God, gas!
I am sorry, I can't help it, I'm old.
No, no. The other kind of gas.
The kind that kills.
Sometimes my gas...
It's seeping in through the vent.
It's locked from the outside.
Help!
It doesn't smell that bad to me.
Help!
Did I do right, Sam? Telling them about
the gay bar?
Perfect, sweetheart. They took the bait
like a dumb (alabit).
Let them think I'm a panty.
While they're busy suspecting me,
one of them is gonna let his pants down.
Sam, why do you keep all those naked
muscle-men magazines in your office?
Suspects...
Always lookin' for suspects.
What's that tickin' sound I hear?
That tickin' sound you hear, Mr. Diamond,
is a bomb in your room
that will go off in 30 seconds.
Signed: The murderer.
Quick, Sam, the door!
PS: The door is locked.
I'm sorry about this, Tess.
And me owing you all that money, too.
That's all right, Sam. What are we gonna do?
I got an idea!
I don't know whether this is gonna
work or not.
Quick, turn around!
I'm turned, Sam.
Whatever you do, baby, don't turn back.
- But, Sam, if anything...
- Do as I say, Angel.
- I will, Sam.
- Good
'Cause I think...
I'm gonna cry.
What are you doing in my bed?
Well, there's no place else to sleep,
Monsieur.
Sleep in the car, you chauffeur, you.
Go, go!
Oh, you aren't fair.
I will tell everyone that you wear a toupee.
They already know.
Then why do you wear it?
I didn't know that you knew.
Certainly I know.
Your terrible toupee.
A bomb!  Across the hall.
Quickly, the door! The door!
It's locked! From the outside.
You look taller to me.
Why is that?
I don't understand, Monsieur,
I'm not getting taller!
If you are not getting taller,
there is only one alternative...
the room is getting shorter!
Oh, mon dieu! The ceiling is coming down!
- What do we do?
- I don't know!
But... this is exactly how they make
goose liver pathé!
Not so fast, please.
Do not cross out Wang name.
Cross out snake instead.
Nice shot, Pop.
Sure wish you weren't such a heavy sleeper.
And now...
if you please...
1 million dollars,
Mr. Bensonmum.
Banzai, Pop!
Very clever of you, Mr. Wang.
Oh, yes. As you can see...
I can see.
So I see.
Tell me, as the only survivor,
how did you deduce it was me?
Went back to theory seldom used today.
"Butler did it".
Oh, I hadn't thought of that.
But how do you account for my
dead body in the kitchen?
Body made of plastic.
Same as plastic cook.
While we examine plastic butler,
you murder Lionel Twain.
You're a clever little laundry man, Mr. Wang.
But not quite clever enough.
I'll take that 1 million dollars, Bensonmum.
Alias Irving Goldman!
Irving Goldman?
Yes,
Irving Goldman was the attorney
of the late Lionel Twain.
Lionel Twain died 5 years ago.
His body was recently discovered in
Goldman's filing cabinet.
Am I correct, Mr. Goldman?
Yes. Correct, Miss Marbles.
But how did you escape the poison gas?
Quite simple. I covered my mouth,
and let Miss Withers here breathe in
all the gas.
Oh, Sicky-poo...
Yes, dear, I know.
The million dollars, please.
I wouldn't if I were you, Goldman.
Or is it Goldman?
Actually it's Mr. Marvin Metzner.
Marvin Metzner?
Very good Mr. Charleston.
But how did you know?
The bill in the dead butler's hand,
stating that the entire weekend
had been catered.
Only an accountant would have held onto
a thing like that.
- Dicky, get the money and let's go.
- Give me another second.
Goldman was killed last month while skiing.
He jumped 60 metres into a low-flying plane.
Dicky, I can't wait much longer.
You've not lost your touch, Mr. Charleston.
But how did you elude the deadly scorpion?
Oh, we didn't.
He stung Dora.
We have 15 minutes to get to the doctor.
- Could you explain later, Dicky? Let's go now.
- We'll make it, darling. Never fear.
The prize money, Mr. Metzner?
Belong to me, Messieurs.
Marcel, being one of the world's
strongest men,
stopped your ceiling from crushing us,
and forfeit 13 cm.
It may be months before we are able to
straighten up again,
but a million dollars will buy a lot
of back braces.
Eh?
Miss Eileen Twain? Daughter of Lionel?
What?
I prefer to be called Rita.
But how did you know?
Never underestimate a Frenchmans nostrils,
Miss Twain.
At dinner tonight...
I smelled your Chanel No. 5.
It was you who did away with all of them:
Metzner, Goldman, and your father.
In fact, if you had your way
you would do away with all men.
Would you not, Miss Twain?
Men who have made you ashamed and
made you suffer,
because you were born with brains,
talent, money,
everything but that which you most desired...
beauty.
It is a statement of fact, Miss Twain,
that as a man you are very passable,
but as a woman...
you are a dog!
That's your opinion...
big boy.
And now my money, please.
With luck, I can still make dinner
at Maxim's.
If I were you I'd just order a
tuna fish sandwich
because that dough belongs to me.
That's right, I'm alive and kicking.
Miss Skeffington here dropped
your bomb down the john.
It blew up just as she flushed.
The seat missed her head by an inch.
All right, J.J.
J.J.?
That's right, folks, he outsmarted us all.
Sitting behind that desk is the real
Sam Diamond.
My name is Lumis.
J.J. Lumis. I'm an actor.
I do impressions.
I did the Carson show 6 times last year.
Diamond hired me for the weekend.
Miss Skeffington here is actually
Wilma Norman.
She's a cocktail waitress at the
Waterbed Motel in Carmel.
- Hi
- Hello
Diamond hated all of you.
You were all getting the big money and he had
that crummy little office in San Francisco.
If he proved that he was No 1, he'd get
all your rich clients.
But since I put all the pieces together,
I figure that money belongs to me.
Isn't that right, Mr. Diamond?
Wrong.
That would have been so obvious,
a child could have guessed it.
No, my dear colleagues,
what you all seem to overlook
is the most simple and direct solution.
That I am indeed,
Lionel Twain.
You've all been so clever for so long,
you've forgotten to be humble.
You tricked and fooled your readers for years.
You've tortured us all with surprise endings
that made no sense.
You've introduced characters in the
last 5 pages
that were never in the book before.
You've withheld clues and information,
that made it impossible for us
to guess who did it.
But now, the tables are turned.
Millions of angry mystery readers
are now getting their revenge.
When the world learns I've outsmarted you,
they'll be selling your $1.95 books for 12 cents.
It's checkout time, ladies and gentlemen.
I have your bills ready.
Credit cards will be accepted.
Then even the scorpion was a fake?
Everything. The bridge, the maid.
But you're sure about the scorpion?
Positive. Even the fog,
he made that with a dry ice machine.
See for yourself.
How awfully unromantic.
Then if he really was Lionel Twain,
you must really be...
Sam Diamond!
That's right, baby.
I was in disguise, in disguise, in disguise.
You work hard for 50 bucks a day in
this racket.
I guess that means we won't be seeing
each other again, Sam.
Well, that depends. I'll be around
if you need me.
All you gotta do is whistle.
You know how to whistle, don't you baby?
- Certainly, what'd you mean? I don't understand...
- Forget it
You ruined it.
I don't understand, Pop.
Was there a murder or wasn't there?
Yes.
Killed good weekend.  Drive please.
