Good morning.
-Morning.
-Good morning.
Good morning.
So, here I am. All ready for battle.
I'd better introduce you.
This is Mr Peter Wakeling,
our new colleague.
Mr Wakeling, Mr Hart.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
-And Mr Rusbridger.
-How do you do?
You're eagerly awaited, Mr Wakeling.
We've been short now,
nearly two months.
Well, I hope to make a difference.
It may take a week or two though.
Don't worry, old chap.
This time of morning,
it's a kind of rule.
Not too much fun and laughter.
Rather like church.
Oh.
Yes, I see what you mean.
First day's always
a bit nerve-racking.
-Yes.
-You'll get the hang of it.
As for these chaps here,
they'll improve somewhat
once they wake up.
It's not us you have to worry about,
Mr Wakeling. We're your pals.
But you'll need to get
on the right side of the old man.
You mean Mr Williams?
He seemed a decent sort
at the interview.
A little on the frosty side, perhaps.
The truth is, I didn't really get
to see too much of him.
Well, you're about
to get another chance just now.
His station's coming up.
Mind the doors.
Is he coming in here?
Oh, no. He never travels with us.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, Mr Williams.
Come along, Mr Wakeling.
- Good morning, Sir James
- Hmm.
Mr Rusbridger,
why has this D19 come back to us?
Mr Wright at Planning was of the view
that a remittance certificate
should be attached to it.
A remittance certificate
can only be issued
after the D19 is authorised.
Yes, I tried
to tell Mr Wright that, Mr Williams,
but he simply won't have it.
Then we can keep it here for now.
It'll do no harm.
Consider yourself very fortunate,
Mr Wakeling.
Bequeathed one
of our tallest skyscrapers.
Courtesy of Mr Woodward,
your predecessor.
If your skyscraper
isn't very tall,
or, God forbid, you work so fast
you don't have one at all,
people will suspect you of not having
anything very important to do.
I see.
So here's your first rule,
Mr Wakeling.
Keep the skyscraper high.
The ladies from Chester Street, sir.
Please show the ladies in, Mr Singh.
Mr Middleton, your turn,
if you don't mind.
Of course, Mr Williams.
Mr Wakeling, perhaps you'd like
to assist Mr Middleton
-with the ladies.
-Of course, sir.
Ladies. How are we today?
We were elsewhere
in this building all yesterday.
First at Parks, then at Planning...
then at Cleansing and Sewage.
Then just before closing yesterday,
the gentleman said we were
to bring this to you.
Let me speak with Mr Williams.
Just a moment.
Public Works,
how may I help?
New here, ain't you?
Yes. First day, actually.
Well, you enjoy yourself, son.
No end of entertainment
you'll get here.
Eliza.
I'm just chatting
with the young gentleman.
Your letter and your petition
are very well presented.
We, of course, know this from before.
However, you must first take it
to Parks and Recreation
on the third floor.
We were there yesterday, sir.
They even thought
to offer us a bench to sit on.
-That's how long we was there.
-Eliza.
I do apologise.
And we don't wish you
any further inconvenience.
So, Mr Williams has suggested
you be accompanied
by a member of our staff to ensure
there's no further confusion.
This is Mr Wakeling.
Oh!
Splendid. Er ...
Splendid. Yes,
then I'll make sure, erm,
all the confusion is...
Well,
that's lovely, son.
Then you'd better hop over
to our side of the fence.
Yes, quite right.
Thank you, Mr Singh.
If you ladies would care to follow me.
Allow me
to lead the way, Mr Wakeling.
We're perhaps more familiar
with this building than you are.
Forgive me, everyone.
Unfortunately, I shall be obliged
to leave early.
At twenty past three.
Er, Mr Middleton, perhaps you'd be
so good as to deputise in my absence?
Yes, of course, Mr Williams.
I'll see everything stays shipshape.
Thank you, Mr Middleton.
Is it really true
you may be leaving us, Miss Harris?
It's not certain yet, Mr Williams.
I did have my interview
and it seemed to go well.
It's Lyons Corner House.
So, will you become one
of those, erm...
What do you call them?
Skippies? Nippies?
You'll look fetching
in that apron, Miss Harris.
It's an assistant
manager's post, Mr Hart.
At least, once I've settled in.
I wasn't trying
to be cheeky, Miss Harris.
They do
an excellent treacle sponge.
At least the one
on Coventry Street does.
Good idea, sir.
Hmm?
Mr Wakeling, I mean.
A playground
is what's sorely needed, love.
There's nowhere
for them to play.
A cesspool.
No other word for it.
Rats the size of that.
And our houses backing right on to it.
What on earth?
You'll have
to get used to that, love.
So, you were saying
it was 'K' staircase?
-Yeah, the 'K' staircase.
-Right. Righto.
-It's the last one.
-Yes.
-Thank you so much.
-You're welcome, sir.
Good morning.
Er, this way, ladies. If you will.
Come on.
- Parks have insisted, sir...
- That's all very well,
but we've been through this before,
haven't we?
First we need all that water drained.
I've explained this to you already.
Cleansing needs to look at it first.
Good day, ladies.
A children's playground.
So, this isn't for us.
But I'm sure
the Public Works Department
will be pleased to assist you.
Public Works?
That's where he's from.
You're from Public Works?
Well, yes. First day, actually.
Then why on earth have you brought
these good ladies here?
I do apologise.
Yours is an excellent scheme
and I wish you well with it.
Look here, take this back
to your office at once.
These ladies deserve better.
Good day to you.
Mr Wakeling, what may I do for you?
The ladies' petition, sir.
Mr Harvey at Cleansing insists,
er, that this is for us after all.
Mr Harvey is quite wrong.
But we can keep it here.
There's no harm.
Thank you, Mr Wakeling.
So, where
did you decide on in the end?
Bournemouth.
Ten days starting next Monday.
Oh, lovely.
You must be looking forward to it.
Same guesthouse
we stayed in year before last.
The lady there provides
a very nice supper.
- Next patient, please.
- Yes, Doctor.
Mr Williams? Doctor will see you now.
Thank you.
I much prefer the beach
in Bournemouth.
A pebble beach
is so uncomfortable.
I couldn't agree more.
Mr Williams.
Please, sit down.
Thank you.
The results have come back.
I'm afraid this time
they're pretty conclusive.
It's never easy, this.
Quite.
And I said,
"Look, if that's what you want,
then I know a place
where you can get it".
That's incredibly
wicked of you.
- Good evening, Miss Fry.
- Good evening.
Stop it.
-She's still watching us.
-How can she be?
She doesn't have eyes
in the back of her head.
I assure you she does.
If your father's in,
this is a good time to talk
about you know what.
Not a good time.
You'll have to start
the ball rolling at some stage.
Yes, but not tonight, darling.
I'm really not up for it.
Besides, he's not in.
But this isn't
his cinema night.
Hello? Dad?
He missed his cinema
on Tuesday, so he's gone tonight.
As I was saying,
you can't put it off forever, dear.
I don't intend still to be
in this stifling house come Christmas.
Christmas?
How can anyone purchase a house
and move in that sort of time?
And besides, darling, it is his money.
Your mother intended
that money for us all.
What's he sitting on it for?
We're the ones who need it.
You have to speak to him, Michael,
I mean it.
Mike...
-Father. What on earth?
-Oh.
Dad, you gave us a start.
Thought you'd gone to the pictures.
-Dad, are you alright?
-Yes.
I was just...
sitting here, erm,
thinking things over.
And then you two walked in.
Will you sit for a while?
-Well...
-No.
We both have early starts.
I have to get ready for bed.
You should too, dear.
Goodnight.
Well, better get going.
-Heard what the boss just said.
-Yes.
Come on. Mum's leaving us behind.
Well done, your boy.
Well done.
I'm being serious.
Chap like you needs a wife.
As for your boy,
well, he'll come round to it.
Youngsters get used to anything.
Dad!
Dad.
Dad!
Michael.
Would you lock up?
We're not coming down again now.
Dad?
Dad, are you there?
Yes.
Night, then.
Goodnight.
He's never late.
Something must have happened.
Daughter-in-law
said he'd left as usual this morning.
Do you think we should, erm,
you know, alert the police, perhaps?
Mr Williams
is hardly an infant.
What will the police care that
he's a couple of hours late for work?
"Couple of hours late
for work."
Who would ever have thought.
Leaving early yesterday. Late today.
Maybe he's just, you know,
decided he's had enough.
Gonna give it all up.
I don't appreciate
that suggestion, Mr Hart.
In fact,
I find it in rather poor taste.
Pity he should choose today
of all days.
Why is that, Miss Harris?
Because the Lyons Corner House
have requested my reference.
So, I need Mr Williams to...
If it's a reference you're after,
Miss Harris,
I'll be happy to step in
as Mr Williams' deputy.
Hang on.
He's just a little late, that's all.
- No need for you to...
- Quite.
Thank you, Mr Middleton,
but I'd prefer to wait
for Mr Williams to return.
How can it be that
in this resort town of ours,
insomniacs converging
from every corner of the land,
a fellow's not able
to buy such a thing
-as a sleeping tablet?
-Oh,
you don't half go on, Mr Sutherland.
If you was really sleeping
as little as you say...
I don't see how your brain
could keep coming up
with them ridiculous phrases.
Never mind your...
well, "entertainments"
shall we call them.
Consider, I beg you,
my last great work.
"Shocking Stockings."
Now, I very much suspect you judged it
to be smutty and trivial.
You know very well, Mr Sutherland,
I never saw it.
My point exactly. The dramatic vision
of your most loyal customer
and you shun it.
You turn away with a blush.
Would it have been that way in Paris?
Where, triumphantly disowned
by my entire family
I so deliciously misspent my youth.
The night, the wine, the women,
the cabaret, the Moulin Rouge.
Who knows, Mrs Blake?
Had you been born French,
you might even now be kicking high
those lovely legs of yours
for the appreciation
of a discerning audience.
Mr Sutherland, really!
This little town of ours, Mrs Blake,
English it may be,
but I still have
high ambitions for it.
Bournemouth, Bognor Regis,
they're long beyond reach.
But here, hope still lingers.
I could achieve all this,
all this and more for this town,
if only...
if only I could sleep.
Excuse me.
I don't mean to intrude.
You do not intrude, sir.
In fact, you are most welcome
to join our conference here.
That's most kind.
But I wondered if I might have
a private word with the gentleman.
I see, yeah.
Well, I'll leave you to it.
The things that go on.
Well, sir, may I take it
you're inviting me aboard?
If you'd care to.
Excuse me. I just thought...
overhearing what you were saying...
Yes.
If you like...
you're welcome to these.
Very kind of you, old man.
It's just what I need.
And...
these.
Rather a lot, old man.
I'm grateful to you.
I'll take them off your hands.
I did think about it.
But I don't have it in me,
that kind of thing.
Think of the inconvenience
to your landlady.
Odd. I thought about exactly that.
It's not
perhaps quite what you think.
You see...
this is rather a bore, but the doctors
have given me six months.
Eight or nine at a stretch.
I'm so sorry.
Funny.
You're the first person I've told.
The thing is, I just came down here.
Look, you're...
You're most welcome to those.
I've no more need of them.
Six months.
Nine.
It doesn't seem long,
but it's something.
Enough time to put things in order
and to live a little, if you chose to.
I withdrew some cash.
It's almost half my life's savings.
Look here, old chap. Enough of that.
You need to be more careful.
You see my problem.
I withdrew this cash
and came down here to...
Enjoy myself, or live a little,
as you put it.
But I realise...
I don't know how.
Yes!
Then he needed
to be tough.
No, no, no. No, no.
When a girl like that steals your hat,
always cheaper to buy a new one.
Out with the old.
New phase of life!
You see, that hat. That's not bad.
That could work.
Do you know what I mean?
Can you imagine something like that?
I think that's good.
I'm gonna talk to him.
I'm gonna talk to him,
because I think, for the right price
-we can get that.
-Well, I, there's no need.
-I'm gonna talk to him.
-Really?
Show you something really special.
Strictly VIPs only.
♪ Yes, we have no bananas
♪ We have no bananas today ♪
And so it falls to me to steer
the family line as a playwright.
Hattie, this here is my friend,
Mr Rodney Williams of Esher, Surrey.
And, do you know, that this man
before you now is grievously ill.
Then why is he drinking?
Why indeed?
He has decided to grasp life,
what little of it remains to him.
And we have to admire him for it.
Don't you admire him, Hattie?
If he's ill,
then this ain't good for him.
Hattie, you don't understand.
This man, until yesterday
was living a shell of an existence,
has sprung to life.
Look. He even has a new hat.
Alright, alright.
Come on, come on.
What else do we know?
Who wants to be next?
Yeah, I, yes.
Yes, I have a song.
And what can you offer us, sir?
Erm, I have a...
I have a little Scotch on my,
on my mother's side.
Looks like you've got a little bit
of Scotch in you right now, mate.
You're right, I am somewhat,
but I'd like to sing you a song,
if I may.
If you happen to know, erm,
The Rowan Tree. Do you know the...?
Rowan Tree. Old Scottish song, right?
Yeah, I have a little Scotch in me.
My late wife, too.
Erm, she was, erm...
♪ Oh rowan tree, oh rowan tree
♪ Thou'lt aye be dear to me
♪ Entwined thou art wi' many ties
♪ O' hame and infancy
♪ Thy leaves were aye
the first of spring
♪ Thy flowers the summer's pride

♪ We sat aneath thy spreading shade
♪ The bairns around thee ran

♪ My mother, though I see her still ♪
I'm so sorry.
Come along, old man.
I'll show you another place I know.
Mr Williams?
Mr Williams?
Oh! Oh, it is you.
I was quite thrown there for a minute.
I mean, by your new hat.
Ah, yes. I lost my old one.
Well, it's jolly nice.
I do wonder what they'll make of it
at the office.
Yes. I wonder
What would be your guess, Miss Harris?
Will my new hat go down a storm there?
Noah himself couldn't get something
to go down a storm with that lot.
I don't need to worry
about them any more,
because I have a new job
-Oh, yes?
-That's why I'm so pleased to see you.
Well, it's not the only reason,
of course.
I'm very glad to see that you're well
and going about your business.
When you didn't come in yesterday,
and the day before...
Yes, I have rather gone to ground.
But you see, I've had other, erm...
Never mind. Tell me more
about your new job, Miss Harris.
You know about it, Mr Williams.
It's the position
at the Lyons Corner House.
A branch just around the corner
from here.
An assistant manager's role.
At least once I get
into the swing of things.
I'm so excited. Sorry.
No.
-I didn't mean...
-Don't worry.
County Hall is not for everyone.
I am pleased to see you, Mr Williams.
I'm going to be honest.
I do have the job,
but it's subject to a reference.
-Ah.
-And because you were away...
I see how
I may have inconvenienced you.
I was thinking of treating myself
to a light lunch at Fortnum's.
If you'd care to join me,
I could write your reference
over lunch.
-Really?
-Why not?
It might make up
for the inconvenience I've caused you.
Fortnum's?
You know, Mr Williams,
when I see you bowed
over your paperwork like that
I suddenly remember
you are the same person.
The one at the head of our desk,
every morning and afternoon
for the last 16 months of my life.
But now I realise,
you're not really like that at all.
There's so much more to you.
I mean, Fortnum's!
Your new hat.
I won't give you
a more favourable reference
because you say things like that.
I'm not trying to butter you up,
Mr Williams.
I'm saying I got you wrong,
that's all.
Mr Williams, if you promise,
and I mean really promise
to not get angry,
I'll tell you my secret nickname
for you.
-I promise.
-And you really mustn't get cross.
It's not just you.
I have them for everyone.
Only I know about them and my cousin,
Rosemary, who I share rooms with.
I see.
For instance, Mr Rusbridger.
I call him The Hover Man.
Because he just hovers his pen
over the page
with the intention of doing work
but never actually doing work.
And Mr Hart.
Well...
I call him The Confused Chimney.
Because he's constantly smoking
and constantly bewildered.
Have you seen his eyebrows?
Mr Rusbridger,
on my desk.
Doesn't have a clue.
It's very good.
Alright. This time, I'll say the name,
you have to guess who it is.
He's on the fourth floor.
Julius Caesar.
Julius Caesar. Well...
I suppose that would be,
er, Mr Brown, in accounts?
Correct!
Excuse me.
May I get you something else?
A dessert?
Erm, not for me.
But perhaps the young lady might.
Yes.
Oh, I've always wanted one
of those ice-cream sundaes.
A Knickerbocker Glory, miss?
Yes, please.
With the fruit and nuts on top.
-Of course.
-Thank you so much.
Are you sure this is alright?
Of course.
But, Miss Harris, you haven't
come around to your main point.
You were going
to tell me your name for me.
Oh, no, it's a silly nickname.
I don't think I'll tell you.
No, no. You've come this far.
You have to tell me.
Alright.
Remember your promise.
To not get angry.
Mr Zombie.
Mr what?
Thank you.
Mr Zombie.
I saw a film about it
with what's her name.
Erm...
Zombies are sort
of like Egyptian mummies,
but they can walk
and go about doing things.
They're sort of dead but not dead.
Mr Zombie.
My, my.
I'm so sorry, Mr Williams.
That's really wicked of me.
You mustn't be upset, Miss Harris.
Mr Zombie. It's rather good.
It's quite appropriate, in fact.
I like it. Mr Zombie.
An Egyptian mummy.
Except I can move about.
-Your Knickerbocker Glory, miss.
-Thank you so much.
Mmm.
I'd better be on the 4:56.
Or else I might find myself sharing
the same train as our colleagues.
That would be awkward.
I do wonder,
we haven't been terribly wicked?
You don't have to worry about
that any more, Miss Harris.
You just keep your mind
on your Lyons Corner House.
I will. I was thinking about you.
Ah!
Don't worry about me.
I've had a wonderful afternoon.
-So have I.
-Well, Miss Harris...
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mr Williams.
No doubt
she'll pop back Monday.
It's rather bad form really, isn't it?
Even if she is leaving.
We know
it's a Lyons Corner House.
Er, Mr Middleton, as Acting Head
wouldn't you be able simply
to look it up?
That would be highly irregular,
Mr Rusbridger.
What, even if there may be far more
than curiosity at stake?
Look, really! Really. I...
I do wish Mr Williams would come back.
Perhaps things would go back to
being a bit more orderly.
People in this neighbourhood
go up to town
and if they were
to see your father-in-law,
just as I did, with this young woman
goodness knows what they would think
and how would that reflect on you
living in the same household?
That's why I just wanted to tell you.
Well, good evening.
Come on.
The woman
is a public nuisance.
A prize mischief maker.
Nothing she likes better
than to put...
Shh!
Look, are...
Are we really supposed
to believe that my...
You have to speak to him.
If people are talking
about this here.
Look here.
There's something
I want to share with you both.
It's, erm...
It's a bit of a bore, really.
But, erm...
I probably should, erm...
It's outrageous.
At his age.
And as for this girl. Barely a woman.
-Certainly not a lady.
-It does all fit.
The calls from his office.
The savings.
You simply must speak to him.
You should have done so long ago.
About everything.
I'll speak to him, alright.
With pleasure, I'll speak to him.
Look here.
There's something I should probably
talk to you, erm, about.
I...
Oh, here you are, Father.
Smells wonderful.
Er, yes. I do hope you'll enjoy it.
Mmm.
Alf Jordan sprained his ankle
while on holiday.
Unlikely to be fit
for the start of the season.
Oh dear. How unfortunate.
It's a bit of a...
bit of a bore, really.
Darling, this is hardly the time
to be reading.
Sorry.
Are we ready?
Of course, we're ready.
Ready as we'll ever be.
Shepherd's pie.
Yes. And decent mince too.
Shall I serve?
No.
Ah...
how splendid.
Thank you, darling.
There was a time
when what one did in London
stayed in London.
But these days,
half of the street works in London.
Well, that's right, my dear.
Half the street.
Miss?
Miss!
The sausage roll is cold.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Miss?
- Yes. One minute, sir.
You're new here, aren't you?
Haven't quite found your feet yet.
Shall I bring you
something else, madam?
Some, some more tea, perhaps?
I shall think about it.
Excuse me.
Miss? Miss!
Make it snappy, please.
It's getting very busy.
Of course, Mr Adams.
Mr Williams.
Skiving again.
I'm disappointed.
And, Miss Harris,
I'm disappointed to find you,
well into your third week here,
still working as a waitress.
It was an assistant manager's post
you accepted?
Yes.
Well, I hope to be given
greater responsibilities in good time.
If you wish,
I might speak with your supervisor.
No, that won't be necessary,
thank you.
Mr Williams, why haven't you returned
to the office?
You did say, last time,
that you would.
Yes.
As it happens,
I was just now thinking about that.
Erm, after all, it's not as if
I've found a wealth of other ways
to occupy my time.
Mr Williams, it's very busy.
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah, of course, I'll let you go.
But, I am...
I did wonder
when your present shift ended.
Why would you mind about that?
Why?
Well, for one thing,
because they're showing
I Was A Male War Bride
at the pictures.
And I wondered
if you'd care to come along.
No, I shan't be encouraging
this skiving any longer.
You need to get
back to the office, alright?
What will they be thinking?
Er, yes. But, you see, today...
...is my pictures day.
Er, and I was merely wishing
for a companion.
Oh, well.
Cary Grant, Miss Harris.
I understood you were...
quite fond of him.
Any female trouble?
Nothing much, Sergeant.
Have you ever had any children before?
Oh, my aching back.
You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?
No, Captain, I don't.
Oh, Sergeant, you're lucky.
Yes!
Ha!
Mr Williams.
It's time I was going home.
My cousin will be getting concerned.
Oh, of course.
But, erm, look at this.
It may seem easy,
but I assure you it isn't.
Look.
Ohh.
It's so difficult.
Mr Williams, I really must be going.
Oh. Oh, of course.
But before you go, Miss Harris,
wouldn't you like
to have a try yourself?
I have a feeling, you see,
that you'd be rather good at this.
It's the rabbit.
It's the rabbit we're after.
Very well. Just once. Then I'll go.
It's not nearly as easy as it, erm...
Oh, I say!
Well done, Miss Harris, well done.
I might have known you could do it.
Right. Now I'm going.
Yes, of course.
I'll walk you to your bus.
Bravo, Miss Harris.
Miss Harris?
What is it, Mr Williams?
I wondered...
if you'd... join me for a drink.
A few mins, that's all.
Because you see, I...
...I don't... I don't feel quite able
to go home just yet.
Oh, this isn't very nice, really,
is it, Mr Williams?
I know it's quite innocent,
and I'm not implying anything, but...
Well, you're much older than me.
And someone,
someone might suppose that...
you're becoming infatuated.
Infatuated?
I suppose, in a way, I am.
But not quite as some might suppose.
I realised, since you arrived,
how very different it had been.
I confess I did at times worry
if your attitude was, well...
appropriate.
But I came to appreciate you.
And, and not, not simply
for your youth.
There was some other quality.
Your...
appetite for life.
Your... the way you always make
everything jolly and gay.
Even while working there with us.
Mr Williams...
I'm-- I'm just an ordinary person
like everybody else.
I-- I have no such special quality.
I try to stay cheerful.
That's true, but--
Miss Harris,
I wonder if I may confide in you.
There's something
I haven't really told anyone else.
Not even my son.
It's quite...
a bore, really, but the fact is...
The fact is I'm not expected
to live much longer.
I have a cancer. Here.
After receiving my news, I...
I took to looking
around myself a little.
And that day
I saw you in Piccadilly...
I thought, "Look at her.
"Look at Miss Harris.
"If I'm only to be alive like her
for one day."
I suppose I...
I hoped you'd show me, or...
teach me to be like you.
Mr Williams... your son.
Why haven't you told your son?
Well...
I think the world of Michael.
However, he's now...
He has his own life to live,
his own concerns,
and that's as it should be.
But you're correct.
I'm behaving like an old fool.
What was it, your name for me?
Mr Zombie.
Yes. Mr Zombie.
I wasn't always.
When I was your age,
from when I was this high,
what I wanted...
was to be a gentleman.
Nothing grand. Just a rank
and file sort of gentleman.
I used to see them in the mornings,
all lined up at the railway station,
whenever I went there with my mother
in their suits and hats,
waiting on the platform
to go into London.
A gentleman like that.
That's what...
That's what I longed to be one day.
How did it happen?
I fancy it just crept up on me.
Just one day proceeding the next.
A small wonder I didn't notice...
what I was becoming.
And then I looked at you.
And I remembered...
what it was like
to be alive like that.
I wonder if you ever stop
on the way home
and watch the children playing.
In the street, or in the yard.
And when the time comes
and their mothers call them in,
they're often reluctant.
They, they get a little contrary.
But that's as it should be.
Far better that than to be the child
you occasionally see,
he's sitting by himself in the corner
not taking part
not happy, not unhappy.
Merely waiting
for his mother to call him in.
I've become afraid
that I might end up like that child.
And I so very much
do not wish to do so.
When the time comes,
when my Maker calls me...
Miss Harris...
I hope you'll able to forgive me.
Please forgive me for everything.
I've kept you far too long.
We must get you to your bus stop.
Mr Williams, are you all right?
Never better. But we must hurry.
Your cousin will be anxious.
Good morning, Mr Singh.
Would you come with me.
- Good morning, everyone.
- Oh, Mr Williams, sir.
-Welcome back, sir.
-Mr Hart.
Our file on the bomb site
at Chester Street.
Erm...
The one that the local ladies
have been petitioning
to turn into a children's playground.
Ah! Now, I believe...
Erm, I believe it's, uh...
Yes, sir. I believe
Mr Rusbridger has it.
Yes. Mr Rusbridger, you took it off
of Mr Williams' desk last Friday,
the last time the ladies were here.
-Well, Mr Rusbridger.
-Yes, sir. I suppose I did.
So, it must be here somewhere.
Mr Wakeling, you say
the ladies have been here again?
- As recently as Friday?
- Last Friday, sir.
Yes, here it is.
We have just enough time before lunch.
I propose we go straight away.
Go, sir?
Mr Rusbridger, we'll will take
the file with us,
but please wrap it up well.
It's pouring outside.
Well, that's just it,
if I may say so, sir,
it is very wet just now.
I'm sure we'll manage, Mr Hart.
Mrs Johnstone.
We haven't been formally introduced.
How do you do, Mr Williams?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
The pleasure is all mine.
Mrs Johnstone, would you mind terribly
remaining here and holding the fort?
-Certainly, sir.
-Thank you.
Messrs Middleton, Hart, Rusbridger,
and Wakeling, if you'd follow me.
Thank you, Mr Singh.
Chester Street.
District Line to Stepney Green
and then a brisk walk.
It was a lovely service.
I think everyone enjoyed it.
Pardon?
It was a lovely service.
I think everyone enjoyed it.
Yes, yes. I think so.
I think so. Yes.
Good afternoon, Sir James.
Jolly decent of you to show up.
Good afternoon, Mr Ryman.
Middleton, sir.
You worked alongside him.
Must be like losing family.
Yes, sir.
It feels almost like that.
I want you to know
how very sorry we all are.
- Very good of you, sir.
- Thank you, Sir James.
Look here, Mr...
-Middleton, sir.
-Middleton, quite.
Erm, perhaps, you'd be good enough
to come to my office Monday morning.
We might talk this over.
How best to handle it from here.
Of course, sir.
Naturally, one wants to give credit
where it's due.
But the way those ladies
have been kicking up.
In the end,
it does a disservice
to the memory
of our dear departed friend.
Such a self-effacing fellow.
If he were here,
he'd be the first to protest.
Excuse me.
Miss Harris.
-Hello, Mr Wakeling.
-Hello.
Erm, I saw you talking
with the ladies.
Yes, they're very distraught.
They were so fond of him.
Yes.
Look, Miss Harris, erm...
Well, I was, I suppose
I was just wondering if, erm...
What were you wondering, Mr Wakeling?
Mr Wakeling.
Mr Williams.
I'm sorry to raise this here.
But I thought it best
to give this to you right away.
Oh.
It was among my father's things.
Quite prominent.
He's marked it
"private and confidential'.
So he has.
Miss Harris.
We haven't been introduced, I know,
but I wonder if we might have
a word in private.
-In private?
-Yes.
-If, if you wouldn't mind.
-Of course.
- Excuse me.
- Not at all.
This way.
Excuse me for bringing you away.
Oh, no. No, not at all.
I appreciate you coming today.
Thank you.
I'm awfully sorry.
Must be such a huge loss.
It is rather.
We haven't really been introduced.
No.
I know that you worked with him.
Yes, well, only briefly.
Margaret Harris.
Miss Harris...
How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm sorry, I should have come
and introduced myself earlier,
-but you seemed so busy and...
-Oh, that's, that's quite alright.
I really am dreadfully sorry.
This must be so hard for you.
One bears up.
And I've been through
this sort of thing once before.
Oh, yes.
Miss Harris...
there was something
I wished to ask you.
Of course.
There's something I,
I can't quite, erm...
Did my father know he was ill?
That he was dying?
I don't know what...
I don't know what to say.
Because if he knew...
and he told you...
You see what I mean?
Why wouldn't he tell me?
Well...
Perhaps he...
If he'd just told me...
I'd never have let him
leave us like that.
In all that cold.
I'm sorry.
Er...
Thank you, Miss Harris.
What's that you've got there?
Nothing.
I'll read it some other time.
Any of you chaps get a chance
to talk to Mrs Smith?
Or any of the other ladies?
You know, one appreciates them
sticking up for the old man's memory.
But they've quite convinced themselves
that Mr Williams built
that playground entirely by himself.
Parks did get more credit
than they deserved.
That's because they're called Parks.
Sir James certainly got his share
of the credit.
Made certain of that.
Sir James was quite crucial
as far as that playground's concerned.
Suppose he was.
You know, I, I can't help thinking.
And I, I didn't know Mr Williams
the way you all did,
of course, but...
-...but it does seem to me that he...
-That he changed.
Yes.
It was this playground business.
Chester Street.
District Line to Stepney Green
and then a brisk walk.
No, you must...
No, I insist, sir.
Honestly.
He was willing to traipse
through all that sewage water
- just to get to the site.
- -He did become...
obsessed.
He was prepared to make himself
a right bugger about it.
I accompanied him once to Planning.
This is it here.
Leave it with us and we'll send it
down to you once it's ready.
That ogre Talbot
was presiding that day.
Actually, I was hoping
you might see to it now,
and then I could take it
off your hands straight away.
Well, I'm unable to authorise it
just like that.
Look, look, don't worry.
I'll see it gets done.
We'll send it down to you.
Why don't I wait here
while you check those entries?
Well, it's up to you, but you might
find yourself waiting for some time.
We've got a lot on up here.
Take all the time you need, Mr Talbot.
I'm quite happy here.
Mr Hart, you'd better get back.
Tell the others I've been held up.
Indefinitely.
Of course, Mr Williams.
He said he'd sit and wait
all day if he had to.
And he did.
This is very good of you, Mr Jones.
I know we're placing an extra burden
on all of you here.
So, this is what?
A kiddies' playground?
Yes.
Urgent?
We'd appreciate
your giving it priority.
Well, if you request it, Mr Williams.
Thank you, Mr Jones.
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.
Instead of just leaving...
he went over
to each of them in turn...
Thank you.
...looked them in the face...
Thank you.
...and thanked them all.
Thank you.
Yes, of course. Anything.
I appreciate it.
Thank you.
That's quite alright, sir.
Everyone.
Parks did then rather pull out
the stops, didn't they?
Quite.
The Mr Williams of a year ago
would never thought
of doing something like that.
Actually, I witnessed something
even more remarkable.
I never told you chaps
at the time because...
Well, it rather annoyed me.
So, you see,
for all these reasons,
this isn't something
we can contemplate
for the foreseeable future.
I'm sorry. I genuinely regret it.
We'd gone
up to Sir James' office
to plead a case for the playground,
and Sir James rejected it.
And the site is a disgrace.
Unfortunately, just now,
we have even more urgent priorities.
Well, thank you
for coming to see me.
They're considering Anderson,
for the new editor's post at Punch.
I don't fancy that, do you?
Wouldn't be quite right.
Man's obsessed with the ballet.
Well, that's not entirely fair.
Anderson also cares passionately
about detective fiction and horses.
Sir James...
...please excuse me,
but I beg you to reconsider.
I beg you.
Or, at least... keep the application
open for one more week.
What harm can that do?
He begged him.
He begged him to reconsider.
And he wouldn't take no for an answer.
But it came off.
What, what's that?
It came off.
It must have done.
The Chairman did reconsider.
Well, yes.
Yes, I suppose he did.
Those ladies may have a point.
Well, yes, but we all put
our shoulders to it.
Yes, but...
there's no denying
the old man did push it.
Could it be he knew?
That he didn't have long?
Knowing something like that,
I suppose that might...
galvanise a person.
Yeah, but he didn't know.
His, his son was very clear on that.
I'm pretty sure that's right.
I think he did know.
Ladies.
We mustn't be discouraged.
There will be a way around this.
I assure you.
I don't know how you kept
your temper just now, sir.
I don't have time
to get angry, Mrs Smith.
Something in the way
he said it.
Ladies.
Well, perhaps we'd all do the same.
All of us here.
We'd work with extra urgency
in a situation like that.
Would we?
It's a natural reaction.
Well, I don't know.
I don't think everyone,
we here, even,
would necessarily have responded
in quite the way Mr Williams did.
I agree.
Hm.
If he knew...
he did an awfully good job
keeping it to himself.
It was almost like he...
Yeah.
You're right.
He certainly set an example for us.
Look here, everyone.
Let me propose that we all make
a pledge, here, today.
Let's pledge to learn
from his example.
This lesson he set before us.
Let's vow never again to shy away
from our responsibilities.
Never again to push things
under the carpet. Or upstairs.
Mr Williams has shown us...
Well, that if...
If we put our minds to it...
our backs into it,
we can do even better.
That's right.
And let me say this here today,
while I remain
in charge of Public Works,
we're going to be true
to Mr Williams' memory.
We're going to get things done.
-That's right.
-Hear. Hear.
Reasonably brief, if you don't mind.
-I'm expecting my nephew to call.
-Of course!

Yes, Mr Singh.
Education insist this is for us, sir.
And which one is this?
The disagreement
concerning the proposed prefabs
at Saint Mary's School
in Shoreditch, sir.
Ah, that.
Mr Hart.
Can you look into Saint Mary's School?
That's for Education, Mr Middleton.
It's a Schools matter.
Even so, sir,
Education insist...
Well...
we can keep it here for now.
No harm.
The postal run, please.
Mr Middleton.
Yes, Mr Wakeling.
I'd like this in triplicate,
please, Mrs Johnstone.
That'll be all, thank you, Mr Singh.
I wonder, Mr Wakeling,
if I may now turn to matters
you may consider more personal.
I have no wish
to belittle our playground...
but I put it to you that it was,
all the same...
a small thing.
And that it will, before long...
go the way of most small things.
It may fall into disrepair,
or be superseded
by some grander scheme.
To speak plainly,
we cannot assume to have erected
a lasting monument.
Should there come days
when it's no longer clear to you
to what end you are directing
your daily efforts,
when the sheer grind of it all
threatens to reduce you
to the kind of state
in which I so long existed...
I urge you then to recall
our little playground,
and the modest satisfaction
that became our due
upon its completion.
Evening, sir.
Good evening, Officer.
Everything alright?
Yes.
I just wanted to see
this playground again.
I, I played a, a small part,
just a small part, mind you,
in bringing it into being.
I work at the LCC.
Is that so, sir?
Well, then the people here
have a lot to thank you for.
Oh, I didn't do much.
The man who did...
the man, the man who did
passed away this winter.
Mr Williams.
Mr Williams.
Yes.
He'll be remembered round here with...
respect and affection.
I never actually had the honour
of meeting Mr Williams personally.
He was always that busy.
If you was his...
friend, sir, then perhaps
you wouldn't mind my telling you this.
You know, Station Sergeant
says I'm being foolish.
But, er...
it stays on me mind.
Please.

For his own good, sir,
I should have persuaded him.
Told him to get out of the cold.
But, you see, sir, he looked so...
So happy.
And it, it felt a shame to...
disturb him.
I imagined, in time, he'd just come
off that swing and go home.
Mr Williams had, erm...
had a terminal illness, you see.
And I think it was right...
that you allowed him that moment.
And I think you're quite right.
He was happy when you saw him.
Perhaps as happy as he'd ever been
in his entire life.
So, I wouldn't worry yourself
any more, Officer.
Goodnight, Officer.
