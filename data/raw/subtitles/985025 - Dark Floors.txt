Oh, no. Not again.
Not again.
Dad, please.
Not again.
No no.
Not again.
No no.
Not again.
Dad, please.
- Not again.
- She says it hurts.
No, it just makes
a lot of noise.
You've gotta hold on
for another minute, baby.
Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
Not again.
I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!
I want
the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!
- What's happening?
- There must be a power outage.
- What the hell...
- Sarah!
I want the red crayon!
Sarah, everything's
going to be okay.
- We're gonna get you out.
- Red crayon!
- Release the bed.
- I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!
I want the red crayon!
- Don't fight us, honey.
- I want the red crayon!
- Come on.
- Red crayon!
Red crayon.
I want the red crayon.
I want
the red crayon.
I want the red crayon.
I want the red.
- Okay.
- I want the red crayon. I want the red.
Hey hey, here it is.
I want the red.
You're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Daddy's here.
You'll be risking her health
if you take her home now.
You can't just push
a button and get a diagnosis.
It's a process of elimination.
I mean, I know it's slow,
but we have to go through
all the causes for her symptoms
just to find out
what's actually happening.
I just want her
to feel better.
I don't think
there's anybody in the world
who could do more for her
than we've done already.
Yeah, well, have you
talked to her?
Have you listened
to what she has to say,
or have you just stuck her
in that damn machine?
Sarah keeps repeating the same thought
over and over and over.
I want
the red crayon.
- Sarah?
- I want the red crayon.
- I don't think we have...
- I want the red crayon.
- I want the red crayon.
- Okay, sweetie. Hey hey.
- I want the red crayon.
- Come on, it's okay.
- It's okay.
- I'm really sorry.
The problems we've had
with our equipment lately...
I'm sure this all must be
very exhausting for you.
Have you considered
taking her to an institution?
Especially now that...
I've considered taking
her to another hospital.
You should think about it.
It's a big decision.
Sarah is my daughter.
All decisions that
concern her are big.
Here we go.
Try to get
some sleep, okay?
It will do you good.
No no, not again.
Sleep tight, baby.
Make sure
the bedbugs don't bite.
Love you.
I really really wanna go home.
Hey. Hey, wake up.
Let's get you out of here.
Let's take you somewhere
where they'll listen to you, huh?
I want the red crayon.
I want the red crayon!
- Shh.
- I want the red crayon!
What are you doing?
Look, don't do anything
you'll regret later.
I want the red crayon!
Let us keep her
here for tonight.
I know what's best
for my daughter.
You have to believe me.
If I knew a better place for her,
I would take her there myself.
You think you know better than me
because you have your meters
and your readings.
You don't really
know what's going on.
Look, she doesn't
even want to leave.
Your great machine
just caught on fire with her inside it.
I know that,
but she needs to stay.
We're trying a new drug on her.
I want to sleep.
I want to dream.
You'll get your own bed
in a minute, Tobias.
If we stop the medication,
she could develop
a more serious condition
and we would have
to keep her here a lot longer.
Not six, not seven,
not hell and not heaven.
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah, we're all right.
This elevator sure isn't.
Tobias. Tobias.
Quit messing around, man.
Tobias?
Tobias? Call for help!
This is Rick, security.
We're stuck in elevator 6.
We need help now.
It's an emergency. Hello?
Hello?
This is Rick, security.
We're stuck in elevator 6.
We need help now.
It's an emergency. Hello?
Why wouldn't you
just let me die?
Jesus Christ.
Where is everyone?
Is this where
the repairs are going on?
No.
There should be...
there should be patients here...
and staff.
Shh.
It's the air conditioning.
- What?
- It's off.
It was a goddamn fire drill.
All right, let's take the stairs.
Good.
- It's locked.
- Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
I'm gonna lose it here.
Is there another door?
The maintenance staircase
is in the other wing.
Can't you see?
What are we doing standing here?
Where is it?
Thank you.
Come on, let's go.
What's that noise?
Why don't we just find an exit?
Are all the machines
out of order today?
They should have turned
them off before they left.
Are you coming or not?
I don't understand.
Can't we just get
the hell out of here?
There's no way out of here.
The maintenance
staircase is open.
It's just at the end
of the hall.
Sarah should take
her medicine soon.
- What medicine?
- Well, I was trying to tell you before.
We're testing her
on a new drug for epilepsy.
Epilepsy?
Yeah, the doctors think
that might be the reason...
Who gave you permission
to test this new drug on her?
Well, unlike the other drug,
this drug won't damage her liver.
Sure, of course.
Look, if we discontinue
the use of this medication,
the effects could be fatal.
What is that?
It's coming from over there.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Ma'am?
What the hell is
going on here?
I don't care.
It's none of our business.
Let's get out of here, please.
Didn't you people hear what I said?
Let's get out of here.
We need to call for help.
She who has
no eyes sees everything.
It makes no difference.
They know
where we are at all times.
Stop it.
Not me.
They can't see me.
- Stop it.
- Not me.
They can't see me.
Hello?
Can anyone hear me?
Is anyone there?
Hello? Can anyone hear me?
Is anyone there?
What the hell's
going on here?
Why don't we all
just get out of here?
Come on, let's go.
After you.
You're security, you go first.
Come on.
We need to go down, right?
Let's go.
Come on.
Oh my God.
What was that?
Hey! Who's there?
Go go go go!
What the hell was that?
What was that?
There is only one hell.
Sit down.
Why? It's just a scratch.
I'm going to clean you up.
Oh, yeah, why don't
we make a campfire
- and sing songs while we're at it?
- Hey, calm down.
What, somebody's running around
tearing people's eyes out,
- you want me to calm down?
- Don't pay any attention to him, honey.
- Okay?
- Ben?
Look, a bright light
or a loud noise can trigger a seizure.
We need to stay calm.
What is that?
I've never heard it before.
We can't stay here.
We have to try
and find our way out of here.
I'm not going down
those stairs again.
There's an info desk
in the other wing.
Let's go.
Sarah, wait.
Where are you going?
You think the info desk people
have a solution to this?
You know another way to go?
- No.
- Exactly.
The rain... it stopped.
It's almost too quiet.
The whole hospital is empty.
There's not even a dial tone.
Hello hello.
We're in the north wing
on the fifth floor.
We need some help.
I repeat... what?
If there's something here
clawing people's faces,
do you really want to announce
on the microphone
that we're stuck on the fifth floor?
Look!
They're on the third floor.
What the hell was that?
At least we're not alone here.
Who gives a shit?
Just get us out of here, will you?
- I give a shit.
- Yeah, but that's your job.
Isn't anyone else wondering
where all the people are?
Let's take these.
We might need them.
- Do you know how to use them?
- Sure.
Where's Sarah?
- God damn it.
- Sarah!
- Sarah?
- Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah!
Sarah?
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah, are you okay?
Sarah?
Honey.
You two okay?
Yeah, everything's okay.
Yeah.
Let's just get out of here.
What was in that room?
- I don't know. Nothing, I guess.
- Stop, Ben.
There's no time like the present.
There's no time
like the present.
There's no time like the present.
There's no time
like the present.
There's no time like the present.
And it's gonna get
colder and colder.
And it's gonna
get colder and colder.
There's no time
like the present.
And it's gonna
get colder and colder.
Hello?
The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.
## The number you have d...
Come on!
This is not happening.
This is not happening. What was that?
Go! Go!
I need to switch this off.
No, don't.
Maybe it scared that thing off.
Yeah.
What the hell was that?
You've seen that before, Tobias?
I saw you cover your ears
before she even started,
- so why was that?
- The Scream Queen.
The what?
You tell me.
What are they doing, Ben?
Why are they here, huh?
You know the answer.
The emptiness.
This is a hospital,
and they're doing some repairs.
Maybe they hit a gas pipe
and we're all high
and hallucinating.
Hallucinating the same thing
at the same time?
No, it could be that
I'm hallucinating all of this,
all of you.
Yeah, and you're
wearing a nightgown,
and we're all gonna
wake up at any minute.
The X-ray.
If we stay here for too long,
we're going to be exposed to the radiation.
Cancer's not going to
kill any of us.
This is bullshit.
- You don't want to go out there.
- This is bullshit.
This is just some mass psychosis.
A body with no eyes?
But we all saw it,
God damn it.
Yes, we did,
but it's time to use
a little common sense.
Fool.
I think the rest of us
should stay together.
So what do we do now?
Keep the X-ray machine on
and wait for help.
When is Sarah supposed
to take her medication?
Soon.
What happens
if she doesn't get it?
Help!
Help! Help!
- What was that?
- Jon!
Help! Get me out of here!
Open the door!
Come on, get me out!
Get me out!
To die...
is beautiful.
- Watch out!
- Hurry.
Shit.
Yeah.
Perfect girl.
Tobias, what are you doing?
It doesn't hurt.
Dying's easy.
Stop it.
Stop.
You don't know
what you're doing.
Oh, I know what I'm doing.
I know it 100 times over.
Tobias...
I promise you will sleep.
Do you know...
how it feels
when it's cold?
When it's really
really cold?
He looks okay.
Let's pull him out.
Okay, I got him.
Come on, hang in there.
Hang on! I got it!
What the hell did this?
It's all falling apart.
Everything's falling apart.
Sarah, are you feeling okay?
Have you seen that?
- Have you?
- No.
I want the red crayon.
I want the red crayon.
Just as soon
as we get home, honey.
How are you feeling?
It hurts like hell.
That frickin' rent-a-cop
and his sidekick hit me.
You know, you should be thankful
your head's still on your shoulders.
You almost got us killed.
Me?
If you didn't have to drag
that retarded kid around with us,
we might be out
of here already.
- Is this real, huh?
- Hey!
- Christ!
- Stop it!
Mass psychosis, huh?
Somebody has
to take control of the situation.
No, this situation
can't be controlled.
- Not by you, not by anybody.
- Not by you either.
No.
Shh.
It's the intercom.
I think I've heard that before.
You should know
what that is.
Hello, is anyone there?
Hello?
- Hello?
- Hello?
Hello, what floor are you on?
- We're on the third floor.
- What floor?
What floor?
Hello?
I'm coming.
Well, at least
we know we're not alone.
Oh, yeah, a lot of good
that's gonna do us
if we're all in the same shit.
Let's find them.
Come on.
Oh, what the hell?
They've blocked this exit.
Come on, Rambo.
Do something useful.
Find us a real way out.
You wanted out.
A staircase is behind this?
Yeah, I think so.
So much for that.
We have to go.
Come on.
What the hell happened here?
What in God's world
happened here?
Walter! No!
Walter?
The only sensible solution
is to give up the girl...
give up the girl...
give up the girl...
give up the girl... give up the girl.
It's up to you.
It's all up to you.
Let's go.
Nobody survived.
- Tobias, come on!
- Let's go! Go!
- Ben!
- Take her.
Let's go.
- Go!
- Come on, get out of there!
- Go on!
- No!
Why did he have
to be a goddamn hero?
Nobody asked him to be...
- It's your fault!
- Get off of me.
Come on, calm down.
Looks clear.
They want the girl,
you know.
- How do you know that?
- Isn't it obvious?
The ghost,
the old man's stories, the tapes.
You're starting to believe this.
You could get us
killed if you don't...
You think I'm gonna
let them kill my daughter to save you?
And yourself,
and the nurse.
What if the old man was right?
What if it all depends on you?
What's happening?
Hello?
- Hello?
- What floor are you on?
We're on the third floor.
- What floor are you on?
- We're on...
Why did you hang up?
It was me.
What do you mean
it was you?
It was the same call
I made earlier.
There has to be
some explanation for this.
Maybe an echo.
Maybe you accidentally
recorded something.
No.
Maybe it's some kind of
parallel-dimension thing,
you know?
Like one world
on top of the other.
My watch has stopped.
All the clocks have stopped.
What does that mean?
I don't know what it means,
but time has stopped.
- It's not moving, look.
- How can time stop?
I don't know.
Sarah, what is it?
She needs to take
her medicine.
- Well, where can we get it?
- In the emergency room,
but it's behind
that blocked wall.
You stay here.
We'll clear that wall.
Even if you do get out of here,
what are you going
to do if time stopped?
Right now I just want
to get my child the hell out of here,
- so I'll worry about that later.
- Oh! Ow!
Sarah, everything's
gonna be okay.
Daddy's gonna get
you out of here, okay?
Will you watch her?
If you even lay a finger on her,
you won't live to regret it.
No.
No. No.
I think that's
the fastest way down.
Have you... seen Sarah's drawings?
Yeah, I've seen a lot of them.
What do you make of them?
I think she knows
something we don't.
Don't you start with that.
Ben, when you were gone,
I heard Sarah speak
with Tobias.
I didn't hear what she said,
but she spoke clearly
and didn't repeat herself.
She's just a little girl.
Why does everyone keep saying
she's the reason for this?
And what if she is?
I touched Tobias's hand.
It was cold.
It was like he was dead.
What's this?
Sand.
Guns haven't really helped.
Yeah, well, you never know.
What are you drawing?
It's okay.
You don't wanna show me.
That's okay. It's okay.
You know Sarah's
gonna be okay.
Do you have children?
I have a boy.
- He's four.
- And the father?
I haven't seen him
in a couple of years.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
He wasn't the kind
f man who would...
- What was that?
- I don't know.
This... what the hell?
This is Jon's.
He dropped them.
Remember?
Hey, wait.
- Stop, I need to tell them.
- No, don't you get it?
It was me.
I just shot Rick in the head.
What do you think
they'd say if they saw you?
Come on.
Why don't you and I take...
a little walk?
We'll have a lot of fun.
Shh.
What?
Did you hear that?
What the hell is that?
Come and get her!
You can take her.
You can have her!
Come and get her!
We just want to get out.
She's here.
You can have her.
She's not yours to give away.
What if it really is true?
What?
If I don't give them Sarah,
this is never gonna stop.
If they wanted Sarah,
why didn't they just take her?
Hello?
- Hello?
- The teddy bear man...
Sarah!
Tobias. How did...
Sarah.
You... you're one of them.
Have you ever been cold?
I mean really really cold?
What the...
Cold enough for you?
Sarah! Sarah!
Here she is!
Sarah!
Hey!
No no.
- No.
- Sarah?
- No no no.
- Sarah.
- No.
- Everything's okay.
- Who is that?
- Ben.
Is he dead?
It's like he's been
dead for a week.
We have to go.
Yeah.
We should be able to get
to the ground floor from here.
Okay.
Take the chair.
No, not there.
No no, not there.
Not there.
Do you know how
to get out of here?
No no.
Can you draw it for me?
No no.
This way.
Yeah.
I think we can find
Sarah's medicine in here.
- You find it?
- No.
Could you check that one?
Could there be some other way
out through the garage?
Yeah, the staff go through
the morgue to get to the garage,
even though the chief
tells them not to.
Well, maybe the chief
will make an exception.
Oh, shit.
Sarah?
Look.
Well, she can't have gone far.
You check over there.
I'll check this way.
- Keep your walkie-talkie on.
- Okay.
Sarah!
Sarah? Sarah!
Ben?
Can you hear me?
Ben.
Emily?
Talk to me.
Where are you?
Ben!
Excuse me.
I need help.
Excuse me, can you help me?
Can anybody please help me?
Excuse me.
Where's my daughter?
Sarah!
Ben, can you hear me?
Ben, where are you?
I don't know.
There were people, and they...
What? Where?
The emergency room,
but Sarah's not there.
Where are you?
I'm outside room 235.
Okay, I'm coming.
I can't hear you.
I'm standing right in front
of room 235.
You must be in
a different hallway.
Ben, there's only one 235
in this hospital.
There's a teddy bear
poster beside it.
Ben?
Ben.
Ben?
Ben? Ben?
Ben, can you hear me?
I found Sarah.
She's...
Finally.
Not that way.
Sarah.
Where are you going?
It has to stop.
What are you talking about?
Ben!
What happened?
I don't know.
There were these people,
but it was like
they couldn't see me or something.
Ben?
Come on, Sarah.
It's okay.
We're gonna get you
out of here soon.
What the hell?
Emily.
Emily, come on.
No, take Sarah.
You can come back for me later.
No, that is not going
to happen. Come on.
Okay.
No.
We need to get out of here!
Rest, okay?
- Just try to hold on, baby.
- She's slipping into a coma.
Through those doors
we can get to the garage.
Come on, let's go.
Ben!
Emily! Emily!
Open the door!
Hurry!
It's okay.
We're gonna get you out of there.
You need to open the door!
- Ben, Ben, Ben.
- It's okay.
Please please. Open it.
- No.
- No. No!
It's coming.
It's coming.
It's here. It's here!
Sarah, what's here?
Try to hold on, baby!
Sarah, are you all right?
Again and again and again
and again.
How in the hell
do we get out of here?
Oh no no
no no no!
This can't
be happening.
Everyone will die.
What happens will happen.
Sarah, please!
If you know how to stop this, do it.
What happens will happen.
What happens will happen.
Come on.
Okay. Okay.
It's not your fault.
It's not.
It's not your fault.
You stay here, okay?
Someone will come
and get you.
Hey.
Good night, baby.
Sleep tight.
Don't let those bedbugs bite.
I love you.
Somebody will come
and get you.
Sarah?
Sarah?
What are you doing?
No.
Try to hold on
for another minute, baby.
No, not anymore.
I'd like to go home now.
You don't understand.
Light can't live in darkness.
No, you're not going to do that.
Sarah, I don't feel cold anymore.
