MAN: Way to go, Mike!
Uh...
I'd like to begin...
Um, obviously, I want it to be fun,
but I want to be truthful.
'Cause the people out there
are tremendous fans, uh, locally.
But as we, uh, as we go through this,
I want you to understand
the greatest thing that has happened to me
in my experience of professional football
is to have the opportunity
to work with people with a common goal
and with the same purpose,
and to sacrifice.
I'll say this,
it's painful playing football, obviously.
And, uh, it's not a lot of fun out there
to be in two-a-day drills
in the heat of the summer,
and, uh, banging heads.
It's not a natural thing.
I was scared I'd fail.
Honest to God, I was scared I'd fail.
I'm still scared of that.

(SHIP HORN BLOWING)
ATTORNEY: The state has asked,
after a lengthy trial,
a death sentence and two appeals,
why we would learn anything new from you.
Dr. Omalu, do you have a medical degree?
Uh, yes. From the University of Nigeria.
At Enugu, Nigeria.
And I did my residency
at Columbia University Medical School
in New York.
Um, I also have master's degrees
in Public Health and Epidemiology.
In addition,
I am a certified physician executive,
uh, with a specialty
in Emergency Medicine.
(STUTTERS)
And, of course, I'm board-certified
in Forensic Pathology, Clinical Pathology
and Anatomic Pathology.
Uh, my... My focus is Neuropathology,
the examination of the brain.
- While working as a Medical...
- I'm sorry. So sorry. I'm sorry.
Uh, I'm also completing my MBA
at Carnegie Mellon University.
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, uh, and, uh, before I came to America,
a master's degree in the Theory of Music
from the Royal School of Music in London.
Oh, but... Oh, your...
Your original question, uh, what can I add?
Um...
My specialty is the science of death.
I think more about why people die
than I do the way people live.
Hands of the deceased.
Broken and dislodged fingernails.
The hands of a woman
who fought wildly for her life and lost.
The hands of the defendant,
Thomas Chambers.
And that is, in fact,
the blood of the victim.
Now, doesn't that suggest
that the state has the right man?
I thought so, until I heard hour 217
of Mr. Chambers' police interview.
I heard him very clearly say,
"I hate blood.
"I had a tooth pulled as a child once
and it would not stop bleeding."
- So, I got curious.
- What about?
Hands. I could not reconcile
these conflicting sets of hands.
So, my mind... My mind is... My mind
is going mad, and I'm trying to figure out
if Thomas Chambers' family
has a history of hemophilia.
So, I asked his father
and, uh, his father said no.
But there is a strain of hemophilia,
hemophilia A,
so rare that it is never tested for.
Mr. Chambers tested positive
for hemophilia A.
His hands may have touched the victim,
perhaps to aid her, as he claims.
If his hands had been the murder weapon,
if he had been scratched or bitten,
he would have bled to death.
If the state of Pennsylvania
moves forward to execute,
you will be killing an innocent man.
ALL: (SINGING) Happy birthday to...

Nothing. I'm doing my work. I'm fine.

sometimes in life, you know, you just...
You're asked to leave it alone.
But, uh, sometimes you can't.

this is a time that I should leave it alone?
No, I don't.
I never leave it alone.

Okay, okay. (CLEARS THROAT)
All of these animals have shock

The woodpecker's tongue extends through
the back of the mouth out of the nostril,
encircling the entire cranium.
It is the anatomical equivalent
of a safety belt for its brain.
Human beings?
Not a single piece of our anatomy
protects us from those types of collisions.
A human being will get
concussed at 60 G's.
A common head-to-head contact
on a football field?
One hundred G's.
God did not intend
for us to play football.

(STUTTERS) Okay.
Um, okay. Look.

- Uh, the Steelers.
- HAMILTON: And the O's?
- The others, obviously.
Yes, the other team.
Do you even watch football?
Uh, no, not at all.
But I've been studying
Mike Webster's position.
The man in the middle is quite deceptively
the most violent position on the field.
The slaps, the punches, the forearm.
It is an unremitting storm
of sub-concussive blows.
The head as a weapon
on every single play of every single game
of every single practice, from the time
he was a little boy to a college man,
culminating in
an 18-year professional career.
By my calculations,
Mike Webster sustained
more than 70,000 blows to his head.
Now, now, these men, these men,
these are the fastest.
Now, their speed multiplied by
the speed of the men who hit them,
the G-forces generated
equivalent to hitting them on the helmet
with a sledgehammer.
All of this
triggered a cascading series
of neurological events
which unleashed killer proteins
upon Mike Webster's brain,
the tangles invading
and strangling his mind from the inside out.
Like pouring wet concrete
down kitchen pipes.
As it hardens, it chokes the brain,
leaving him unrecognizable,
even to himself.
I don't know football. I've never played.
But I am telling you
that playing football killed Mike Webster.
And I am certain that there are others.
And how can you possibly know that?
Common sense.
But they are either dead or lost
in the way that Mike Webster was lost.
I'm not interested in common sense.
I'm interested in science.
And science is knowing.
I know from these players' records
that their doctors believe
they have early Alzheimer's,
which is statistically impossible.
They're too young.
Because it's not Alzheimer's.
It is this.

Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
Yes. CTE.
So, what happens now?
We publish.
Uh, DeKosky is going to coauthor.
- DeKosky?
- Yes.
Omalu, DeKosky and Cyril Wecht.
Oh.
Well, I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.
See? The gray's the right color.
The blue shows the dirt, even in the rain.
Here you go.
(CHEERING)
Let's go, baby!

Come on, get it, get it, get it!
COMMENTATOR: And watch the play-action.
The safeties jump up.
And look at that touch

You may not!
I say not to, but he does.
COMMENTATOR: Roethlisberger
scrambling out of the pocket.
Throwing across the middle! Caught!
Burress at the 45!

- And if you don't know, Plaxico!
Yeah. That was a pressure toss
by the rook.
- I'm hearing voices.

You're scaring them.

ANCHORWOMAN: A few months
after Steeler favorite Justin Strzelczyk
was killed in that fiery accident,
yet another Steeler favorite, Terry Long,
has apparently committed suicide
at the age of 45.
SULLIVAN: Oh, Terry.
You wonder where they are now?
Now we know.
Terry Long, Pittsburgh Steelers.
I guess these guys only die
when you're working.
- What other problems did he have?
- Arrested a few times.
Fraud, federal theft.
Wow, arrested a lot.
I need a full autopsy.
- Same tests as Mike Webster.
- You're paying for that, too?
Yes, Danny, I'm paying for that, too.
Joseph Maroon.
BENNET: This is my dream.
The schools are good.
You are good, Prema.
I'm sure you see good in me.
I see all that you are.
I want to marry you.
We can fall in love.
If you want to marry me,
I will marry you.
That is good,
because I already made the down payment.
(CHUCKLES)
I saved all my money

(INDISTINCT COMMENTARY ON TV)
(PHONE RINGS)
RECEPTIONIST: I have Chris Jones for you.
I'm just looking at it.
Anything to be concerned about?
This Omalu, he's a coroner in Pittsburgh.
He looks like a nobody,
but let me get into it.
All right.
(SIGHS)
(PHONE RINGS)
- Hello?
- MAN: Is Bennet Omalu there?
Uh, yes, he is.
Okay.
Yes.
I'm a neurologist
who's worked around football for years.
Very familiar
with the NFL's concussion research.
And the League concluded unequivocally
that football players
do not get brain damage.
Webster is one random case, Mr. Omalu.
Dr. Omalu.
Well, whatever. You're an uneducated quack
and your career is over.
(CLICKS)
WECHT: They said you were uneducated?
Did they even read your résumé?
Well, I got calls, too.
Apparently, the National Football League
owns neuroscience.
Who knew?
"Failure to find."
"Absence of clinical information."
- What do they want?
- Your head on a spike.
They want you to retract your findings.
They want you to say you made it all up.
- I made it up?
- They're accusing you of fraud.
If you retract, you'll be fine.
This all goes away.
Why... Why are they doing this?
They're terrified of you.
What did you think they were gonna say?
"Thank you"?
Yes.
- What the hell for?
- For being told.
For knowing.
Oh, I understand.
You think you're being a good American.
So, the city of Pittsburgh
spent $233 million
to build their glorious Steelers
a new stadium.
All the while, they were closing
schools and raising taxes.
These people
are not out to change the world.
And this is not some
quaint academic discovery
stuck in the back of
an obscure medical journal.
Bennet Omalu is going to war
with a corporation
that has 20 million people, on a weekly
basis, craving their product,
the same way they crave food.
(SCOFFS)
The NFL owns a day of the week.
The same day the church used to own.
Now it's theirs.
They're very big.
(SNIFFS)
Terry Long.
The tests came back positive.
Football gave him CTE,
and CTE told his brain
to drink a gallon of antifreeze,
and he died.
I told you there would be more.
You have done great work.
No one would blame you if you stopped now.
Oh, no one is stopping anything.
Then I'd be lying if I didn't tell you
how important your next move is.
By the time Terry Long committed suicide,
his brain had been consumed
by chronic traumatic encephalopathy.
And it is probable, perhaps even likely,
that a larger percentage of professional
football players have and will die from CTE.
REPORTER: This was the Pittsburgh Medical
Examiner's own Dr. Bennet Omalu,
who today threw down the gauntlet
at the feet of the National Football League.
Thank you.
(CROWD MURMURING)
What do you think?
I think you're gonna be an American hero.
- I'm not even an American.
- That's even better.
That's so fucking American.
PREMA: "Dr. Maroon,
who is also vice-chairman of
"the neurosurgery department at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,
"said of Omalu's CTE diagnosis
that it was fallacious reasoning."
(PHONE RINGING)
Yes.
MAN: Yeah, is this Bennet Omalu?
Dr. Bennet Omalu.
MAN: You want to pussify this country?
You want to vaginize football?
Get the hell out.
Or they'll be doing your autopsy.

BAILES: Dr. Omalu?
Yes.
I took you to be an early riser.
I didn't want to call you at your office.
This is Julian Bailes.
Do you know who I am?
I know who you are.
Mike Webster was a personal friend.
Was he?
Dr. Omalu.
You're in trouble, but you're not wrong.
I'd like to talk with you.
The NFL has known about
this concussion crisis for years.
And what you have there is the research
that forms the basis
for the League's concussion guidelines.
In this study,
some academics put helmets on monkeys
and shook them real hard.
They threw dogs and pigs
and human cadavers down elevator shafts.
Helmets on crash-test dummies
and bashed them together.
And their conclusion?
"No striking player
experienced neck injury or concussion."
So, a concussion's no more dangerous
than a hangnail.
- And that was it?
- Oh, no, no, no.
The NFL did what every organization does.
They put together a commission
to study the study.
Dr. Elliot Pellman's
Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee.
You know who else was on that committee?
- Dr. Maroon.
- Joe, yeah, he was on there.
Plus a couple of other team doctors,
an equipment manager and two trainers,
guys who tape knees for a living.
(CHUCKLES) I mean...
Why am I here, Dr. Bailes?
Doctor, I'm not with the Steelers anymore.
I'm not with the NFL.
Now, do you know how many
Pittsburgh Steelers, just Steelers, now,
have died in the last few years?
And I'm not talking about the older guys.
I'm talking about men that I worked with,
and just the ones that I know about.
Twelve.
And I don't want to see
any more of these men
vanish in the back of a pickup truck.
I know them.
I was them.
And I think you're doing this wrong.
As long as the NFL continues
to deny the truth, nothing changes.
It's only true if they say it's true.
And they've got to say it out loud.
Get me a meeting with the Commissioner.
I want to sit with him, man to man,
face to face. I will make him say it out loud.
They don't want to talk to you.
Football does not want to talk to you.
Like my daddy, a Louisiana judge,
always used to say to me,
"Son, God is number one
and football is number two."
(CHUCKLES)
Besides, to them you're not even American.
You're not even African-American.
You're...
A doctor?
(CHUCKLING)
Okay.
Look.
The League has kept everyone in the dark.
And you turned on the lights
and gave their biggest boogeyman a name.
What's happening now, what you think
they're doing to you, that's nothing.
I've done my own research
on this NFL Brain Injury Committee.
You know what Dr. Elliot Pellman is?
He's a rheumatologist.
He's a specialist in arthritis
and joint pain.
Can you tell me what a rheumatologist knows
about the brain and brain disease?
Corporate men like this, in this country,
usually go to Harvard or Yale.
He went to medical school in Guadalajara.
- Mexico?
- Yes.
(LAUGHS) I did not know that.
That's beautiful.
(BLOWS)
Now, two cases does not meet
the scientific burden of proof.
You have to keep going.
Just so you understand,
this does not show up on a CT scan.
Which means
there's no diagnosis before death.
In order for me to keep going,
more have to die.
Unfortunately, that's already happening.

This is not good, Dave, not good.
It's in the paperwork.
But, um,
why is the committee doing this, man?
There are five other trustees.
You talk to them?
You're the only one who played, man.
You the only one

Hey, hey, hey. You and me,

We were bangers, hitmen.

You denied the appeal, Dave!
Look, something's wrong with me, man.
I can't sleep. Okay...
I mean, my eyes get crossed.
It just weirds me out.
- Hey, hey! Look at me!
- Jesus!
Look. Twelve years I paid my dues.
I made millions for those assholes.
I mean, come on.
It's not even your money, man.
I'm just asking back what I gave!
Listen. Fat? Stop eating like a pig.
Got a headache? See a doctor.
I've seen 20 doctors!
I just need rent money.
Get your shit together!
You used to be a warrior.
- You fucking sellout.
- Get your hands off me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Dave.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Look, hey, hey, hey.
Remember when we were kids?
Remember when we were kids?
Playing's what we lived for. Huh?

I need your help, Dave.

"Andre Waters, known as 'Dirty Waters, '
notorious for his aggressive style of play

"He was 44."
WATERS' MOTHER: And, uh, this is the part
where he, uh, got knocked out.
COMMENTATOR: Andre Waters has it.
We'll be back...
He said he was all right.
Said he was just a little dazed,
but he said he was all right.
You look well.

I'm fine.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it

No one made it to the funeral.

he said, "Ma,
"I'm ready to go."
Because he knew

Not crazy.

You definitely think he had this disease?
Because I want to believe that.
I believe so, yes.
And now you want what's left of my boy.
You heard about Mike Webster?
And Terry Long and...
And...
And who else?
What do you really want to ask me, Julian?
Dr. Cyril Wecht, Dr. Julian Bailes.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Mmm-hmm.
Andre Waters.
Justin Strzelczyk.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
I just kept sending them back out there.
(SCOFFS) What the hell were you thinking?
You've got to be a part of it.
You've got to be on the sidelines with them
to understand.
Whatever it takes to keep them in the game,
to keep the whole thing going.
Tape, needles, Vicodin,
Toradol, Lidocaine,
Percocet, Lexapro, Zoloft.
- Have I left anything out?
- WECHT: Mmm.
It's tires and oil.
Just mechanics
trying to keep the cars on the racetrack.
Yeah, well, it's not medicine.
I don't know what it is.
It's business.
Oh.
- There you go.
- Okay, okay.
Three cases
is the scientific burden of evidence.
We have four.
That is far beyond anything
the NFL can or cannot deny.
This is bigger than they are.
They have to listen to us now.
(SIGHS)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
- Dr. Maroon.
- (MAROON CLEARS THROAT)
- Would you like a drink?
- I said five minutes.
He doesn't want a drink.
Your conclusions
totally misrepresent the facts.
To say that Webster and Long and Waters
were killed by football is...
Is fallacious reasoning.
Yes, I know.
Where's he going with this?
Just hear him out.
I would like to propose
a formal, controlled study
of former and current
NFL football players.
We will bring together the greatest minds
in America to solve the problem.
We should be working together.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Excuse me?
I was the President of
the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.
And I was the man
who performed the autopsies
on Mike Webster, Terry Long.
Your men.
Men under your care.
Do you know what Mike Webster's wife said?
She said that if she had known
that Mike was sick,
she would have done more for him.
But he died in disgrace.
Your man.
Your man.
You took an oath.
- Tell the truth.
- The truth?
- Tell the truth!
- The truth is
that the NFL is a blessing
and a salvation, my friend.
We employ hundreds of thousands of people.
We send thousands and thousands
of poor kids to school.
The ownership of this football club
has donated millions of dollars
to countless charities.
- Do you want me to go on?
- That won't be necessary.
Oh, it is necessary.
Football is the most popular
sport in America
because it is so goddamn fantastic!
(CHUCKLES)
And that, right there?
That is the beating heart of this city.
And you want to, what, end it?
You want to fold up
the National Football League?
I want to solve the problem.
Who are you?
- What are you asking?
- (STAMMERING) You're a pathologist.
You perform autopsies.
Yes, I am a mere pathologist.
That's it. That's all I am.
(WHISPERS) Wow.
Do you have any idea
of the impact of what you're doing?
- Yes, I do.
- Do you understand the impact
of what you are doing?
If just 10% of the mothers in America
decide that football is too dangerous
for their sons to play,
that is it. It is the end of football.
Kids, colleges, and eventually, it's just
a matter of time, the professional game.
Joe, he does autopsies.
He's not in the outcome business.
He has no business.
Do you know what history does to people,
trained physicians,
- who ignore science?
- Oh, wow.
Sir, I am not done!
History laughs.
If you continue to deny my work,
the world will deny my work.
But men, your men,
continue to die,
their families left in ruins.
Tell the truth.
Tell the truth.
(MAROON SIGHS)
You sure... You sure you want to do this?
I would ask you that same question,
Dr. Maroon.
Oh, your study, I'll get back to you.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Well, that went well.
(BENNET SIGHS)
When I was a boy growing up in Nigeria,
heaven was here and America was here.
To me, it was the place
where God sent all of His favorite people.
You could be anything,
you could do anything.
Americans were the manifestation
of what God wanted us all to be.
I have never wanted anything
as much as I wanted to be accepted
as an American.
But Mike Webster goes mad
and nobody asks why.
They make fun of him.
They insult him on TV.
And now they want to pretend
that his disease does not exist.
And they want to bury me.
It's offensive.
I am offended.
I am the wrong person
to have discovered this.
(SIGHS)
There is no coincidence in this world.
Tell me,
what is the statistical probability
that you, not just a doctor,
but Bennet Omalu, came to America,
ended up here in this rusty place
for you alone to be the one to see this?
When I arrived in New York,
I was attacked.
What happened?
Something that is better left unsaid.
But that man almost broke me.
I wanted to give up and go back.
But I knew God.
I decided to trust His wisdom
and I stayed.
And now I am looking at this man,
an Omalu Onyemalukwube.
Your name, it means, "If you know,
"you must come forth and speak."
How did you know that?
I called your father.
He was pleased to hear from me.
Yes, I am sure he was.
If you don't speak for the dead, who will?
You are of the Igbo tribe, Bennet.
When you have truth,
the thing you are told you cannot do
is the thing you must do.
Embrace that
and nothing created by man
can bring you down.
JONES: Omalu's gone to the press now.
Listen to this.
"After examining the remains
"of former National Football
League player Andre Waters,
"a neuropathologist in Pittsburgh,
Dr. Bennet Omalu, is claiming
"that Mr. Waters had sustained brain damage
from playing football, and he says
"that led to his depression
and ultimate death."
It gets worse.
"Dr. Julian Bailes, medical director
"for the Center for
the Study of Retired Athletes
"and the chairman of the Department of
Neurosurgery of West Virginia University,
"said, 'Unfortunately, I'm not shocked.'"
There's more Omalu and more Bailes.

They want me to do it.

Okay. Yeah.
- They still have to sit and listen.
- To you.

I'm not here because of you.
I'm here because people are dying.

You are here to use me

And get away from our game!
What happened?
Roger Goodell just said that
Justin Strzelczyk may have

That's insanity.

The science means nothing to them.
GOODELL: This is an important day
in the National Football League.
We've had some very good dialogue
which will help us improve
the care for our players.
What do you think when you hear about
former NFL players suffering from symptoms
that has only been seen in boxers
and people at over 80 years old?
I mean, what does that say about
the effect of concussions on players?
GOODELL: I'm not a doctor here,
but you have to look at their
entire medical history.
This is an evolving science.
And that's okay.
PELLMAN:
While I agree with the Commissioner,
no empirically determined proof
was presented today.
Because there simply isn't any.
BERNIE GOLDBERG: Because according
to the NFL's own numbers,
half of all players with concussions
are sent back into the same game,
including some
who were actually knocked out cold.
Ira Casson was head of the team of
NFL doctors who had looked into the issue
and determined that the concern
over head injuries was overblown.
Is there any evidence,
as far as you're concerned,
that links multiple head injuries
among pro football players with depression?
No.
- BERNIE: With dementia?
- No.
BERNIE: With early onset of Alzheimer's?
No.
Is there any evidence
as of today that links
multiple head injuries
with any long-term problem like that?
- In NFL players? No.
- Yeah.

make me say one word against you.
What are you gonna say?
Cyril Wecht's a loudmouth asshole?
I don't care. I'm tired.
My balls are low.
I didn't do good enough by you.
Cyril, um...
I cannot go back to Nigeria.
Everything that I am is here.
My child has got to be born in America.
(PATS ARM)
Don't worry.
I'll get you a job.
Hey, you can work with me
in the prison laundry.
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)
Call the surgeon.
We need a goddamn drink.

BENNET: I solved the problem.
All they have to do is
put on the side of the helmet,
"The Surgeon General has determined that
playing football is hazardous to your health."
You got to put it on both sides
of the helmet.
(BAILES LAUGHING)
BAILES: Did you know that Paul Tagliabue...
This is the former Commissioner Tagliabue,
did you know that Paul was a partner
in Covington and Burling?
Which is the same law firm that represented
the big seven tobacco companies.
Of course he was.
But now they're representing
the National Football League.
Of course they do.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
BAILES: My last year with the Steelers,
we moved a game from
a Sunday to a Tuesday because of a blizzard.
And the League said that they
weren't concerned about the ratings
because the League
was immune from acts of God.
(TIRES SQUEALING)
(HEAVY BREATHING)
GRACIE: Bennet!
Bennet!
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry.
There's no heartbeat.
BENNET: May...
May we have the room, please?
Excuse us. Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I made a mistake.
This is my fault.

MAN OVER PA: Dr. Pierson, E.R. med one.
Dr. Pierson, E.R. med one.
I wish I had never met Mike Webster.
They destroyed us.
And I don't understand
why it is happening this way.
Bennet, listen to me.
Do you know what I chose to fake?
You.
We will have this family.
Yes.
We will.
Just not here.
We have to go.
MAN: Hello? Mr. Omalu?
Dr. Omalu.
MAN: I just need the measurements
for the flat screens.
That won't be necessary.
(INAUDIBLE)
I have drifted
I am worn
I have drifted
Too deep
In the tangle
Of the dark
I am weathered
I have drifted
Too deep
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
BENNET:
Tell me what happened to you, Jose.
Tell me.
It's going to be okay.
(BELL TOLLING)
(HEAVY BREATHING)
Listen.
My mind keeps slipping.
I can't seem to find
the goddamn words no more.
What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I just can't do this.
And I'm sorry.
(GUN COCKS)
(PHONE RINGING)
Yes.
Bennet, it's Julian.
Dave Duerson killed himself today.
Shot himself in the chest. In the heart.
Hold on, hold on.
- My God.
- He left a note.
He wants his brain to be donated.
To be examined.
They said that we were right.
Benny, you there?
Yes. Yes, I'm here.
A Pro Bowler in that deep
with NFL leadership
killing himself in the way he killed himself,
they can't explain this one away.
Players are gonna want to
hear from you now.
BENNET: Trying to find the...
(CLEARS THROAT)
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
I don't know what to say to them.
Tell them what's really happening.
(INDISTINCT MURMURING)
Hello.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Um...
A small boy, uh, came to me
and said,
"Mister, why do you hate football?"
I said, "I don't hate football."
He said,
"Yes, my father said you hate football."
I said, "You tell your father
to come see me."
(SPARSE LAUGHTER)
My wife watches the games.
And she will scream and she will jump.
She startles me a lot.
But through her eyes, I can see the beauty
and the grace, the power.
I said to her
that I wished I'd never met Mike Webster.
But that was before I knew him.
He has given me a great gift.
A dangerous gift.
The gift of knowing.
When a man is a soldier,
he knows what is at risk.
He may be injured or even killed.
But when a man is a football player,
he knows he may break his arm or his leg.
He does not know
that he can lose his mind.
His family, his money.
(SOBBING SOFTLY)
His life.
They have to know.
Mike Webster.
Justin Strzelczyk.
Terry Long.
Andre Waters.
Dave Duerson.
By dying, they speak for the living.
And I speak for them.
That is all I do.
Forgive them.
Forgive yourselves.
(SNIFFLES)
Be at peace.
JOHN CONYERS: Commissioner Goodell,
is there a link between
playing professional football
and the likelihood
of contracting a brain-related injury
such as dementia, Alzheimer's,
depression or CTE?
We're doing everything
we possibly can for our players now.
CONYERS: I just asked you
a simple question. What's the answer?
LINDA SANCHEZ: It sort of reminds me
of the tobacco companies, pre-'90s,
when they kept saying,
"No, there's no link
"between smoking and, um,
damage to your health,
"or ill health effects."
And they were forced to admit
that that was incorrect
through a spate of litigation
in the 1990s.
And my question to you is...
MAXINE WATERS: Oh, we have heard
from the NFL time and time again.
You're always "studying,"
you're always "trying, " you're "hopeful."
Son of a bitch.
I want to know what are you doing
in the negotiations that are going on now
to deal with this problem
and the other problems related to the injuries
that football players obtain
and its impact on their health.
You did all this.
I know my time is drawing to a close,
but let me just say this to Mr. Goodell, uh,
and everybody who's here today
that I think it's time for the Congress
of the United States to take a look.
DEPUTY MAYOR: First time in Washington?
BENNET: Uh, yes.
DEPUTY MAYOR: Well, we're thrilled
you accepted our invitation.
BENNET: I was, uh, very curious.
Chief Medical Examiner
for Washington, D.C.,
means you would also
consult with the CIA and FBI
and any foreign government
requesting the assistance
of the United States government.
Essentially, you're America's
forensic pathologist.
Wouldn't have to put on scrubs
or perform an autopsy.
You're beyond all that now.
Would you like to hear about
the benefits package?
No.
(STUTTERS) I mean, I'm sure it's fine.
We know everything you did, Dr. Omalu.
You exemplify everything it is
to be an American.
You belong here with us,
in the nation's capital.
Why don't you take a couple days
and think about it?
QUARTERBACK: Ready.
Hut!
COACH 1: Get up, get up field,
get up field, get up field!
COACH 2: You heard him.
Move up field, let's go!
COACH 1: You, on the ball, on the ball.
COACH 2: Okay, let's huddle up!
Bring it back, huddle up.
All right, call it out!
Douglas, I'm talkin' to you.
QUARTERBACK: Hut!
- COACH 2: Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em!
- (WHISTLE BLOWING)
That's it. Good!
COACH 1: There you go.
Good job, good job, on the ball.
COACH 1: Let's go, let's go, tempo, tempo!
COACH 2: Tempo, tempo!
COACH 1:
How 'bout we hit somebody this time, huh?
Try a little more contact.
QUARTERBACK: One-sixteen, one-sixteen!

See it in your eyes
There's been a change
I feel distant
There's been a change
A fear
Hangs over my head
I search for peace
In the midst of it all
What we had
In those old photographs
So far gone
I gotta move on

So long

So long
See it in your eyes
