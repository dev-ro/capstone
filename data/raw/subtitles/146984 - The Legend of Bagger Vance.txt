A Iittle bit of magic time.
I feel it.
Yes, sir.
Terrific shot!
I'm in the goddamn woods again.
Goddamn it.
Damn game.
Damn it.
I spend more time in the trees
than the squirreIs.
Wizard Two? Why not?
Not again.
HARDY: I've had five heart attacks
in the last 10 years.
My first was on a golf course
in South Carolina.
It wasn 't that bad. A couple of
doglegs that were more dog than leg.
All in all, it was playable.
Assuming you didn 't die
on the second hole.
The second coronary was at Augusta,
where they had the Masters.
Went down on the first fairway.
Good thing too, because those greens
would have been the end of me anyway.
My wife used to ask me
before she passed on:
Why do I play a game that
seems destined to kill me?
It all started back in 1928...
... when I was just a youngster
in Savannah, Georgia.
MAN 1: Jones and Hagen are reaIIy
at it. Neck and neck.
HARDY: Nuts!
MAN 1: Remember that drive he hit?
MAN 1: Was it 350?
MAN 2: More Iike 400 with the roII.
MAN 3:
I don't care how good they are.
Junuh couId beat them
with his eyes cIosed.
He won three times in a row.
HARDY: When I was growing up,
every town had its heroes.
Ours was Rannulph Junuh.
An athlete who was a born winner.
How I wanted to be just like him.
Junuh has the most difficuIt shot
in the history of goIf.
He must sink this shot from 110 yards
to win the championship.
He steps up to the baII.
The crowd is hushed in anticipation.
Can he make this miracIe shot?
And he swings!
Fore! Watch your heads!
MAN 1: Where did that come from?
MAN 2: I don't know!
MAN 2:
There he is!
HARDY: I'd never seen him play
since it was before I was born...
...but it was said Junuh was on track
to being the greatest golfer ever.
''Titanic off the tee. ''
''Approach shots which fell to earth. ''
As Sam Snead once put it,
''Like a butterfly with sore feet. ''
He won just about everything.
But even he would say
his most significant victory...
... was winning the heart
of Adele Invergordon.
Daughter of the wealthiest man
in Savannah.
(MUSIC PLAYS)
( ADELE LAUGHS)
(GLASS SHATTERS)
But fate plays funny tricks.
It was a patriotic call to arms...
... to fight the war to end all wars.
Junuh and everyone in town
believed it was his destiny...
... to lead the young men of Savannah
into battle.
It was to be his crowning glory.
But nothing could have
prepared him or anyone...
...for the shock and sorrow
of what was to come.
(SCREAMING)
JUNUH: Positions.
-Ready, captain.
-Get ready. Positions.
-Ready, sir.
Prepare to advance.
Sergeant. . .
-. . .advance!
SOLDIER: Advance!
HARDY:
Confused, broken...
...and unable to face a return
to a hero 's welcome...
...Junuh just disappeared.
Hoping to forget...
...and to be forgotten.
But Adele, being a woman of the South,
had survived worse than desertion.
She moved on with her life, dedicating
herself to her father's dream.
MAN: This is the most magnificent
golf resort on God's earth...
...and I'm building it
here in Savannah.
Krewe IsIand.
Legacy to my sweet AdeIe.
And we'd Iike to use aII of you
as our main suppIiers.
MAN 1:
Thank you, that's quite an honor.
MAN 2:
I wouIdn't dream of anything but.
MAN ON RADIO:
People don 't obey, we'll repeal.
We can 't repeal the Commandments,
they don 't obey that.
Yet no law on the statute book--
HARDY: I was 10 years old
when Junuh came home.
Stop!
Less than a year later,
the Great Depression hit Savannah.
Jobs were lost.
Stores and banks were shut for good.
And John Invergordon, having spent
his last dime on his great dream...
...opened Krewe Island on what should
have been a glorious spring day.
(PIANO PLAYS)
(MUSIC PLAYS)
(GUNSHOT)
HARDY: It might not have been a shot
heard around the world...
ADELE:
Oh, Daddy.
...but it reached every
corner of Savannah.
Amen.
I'II be putting some doors and cIosets
in the parIor.
With any Iuck, we can have
boarders within a few weeks.
Hardy, can you share your room
with Cara Mae?
What about the store?
(BAGPIPES PLAYING ``AMAZING GRACE``)
ADELE:
Oh, Jesus.
I've died and gone to heII.
It's not as if you have a choice.
Your goIf resort is dead and gone.
You've got no gumption, NeskaIoosa.
My gumption is not the subject.
Then what is the subject?
If it's your offer to take it for
one-tenth of what my father spent--
You're Iucky to get
a dime on the doIIar.
Just so you can turn around
and reseII it. . .
. . .to some CaroIina paper miII
for a tidy profit?
That you've IikeIy made the deaI
aIready is not my probIem.
We shouId come back when the shock
of your father's passing isn't so--
God.
Don't bother. I'm not seIIing.
You got a stack of debts
that wouId fiII the Cotton Exchange.
And I intend to pay them off. . .
in time.
With what? BaII tokens?
With the money peopIe wiII spend once
they know it's the premier resort.
Did I miss something? Or are we not
in the midst of a Great Depression?
PeopIe stiII have money
and I'II make sure they know--
How exactIy do you intend
to accompIish that?
How?
-WeII, how?
-How?
I'II teII you how.
I'II have the greatest
exhibition match ever heId. . .
. . .on the greatest goIf course
ever buiIt.
-Bobby Jones. . .
-Bobby Jones?
-. . .wiII be pIaying WaIter Hagen. . .
-WaIter Hagen?
. . .for $ 10,000.
-What?
-$ 10,000? You can't be serious.
$ 10,000 for one weekend?
I'd make it more, gentIemen. . .
. . .but that's about aII
I beIieve I can raise. . .
. . .if I seII everything I own
on this earth.
Except Krewe IsIand.
Jones and Hagen
are coming to Krewe IsIand?
To pIay an exhibition
match for 10 grand?
That's correct.
They don't know it yet,
but that's what they'II be doing.
Are you off your rocker?
Nobody has the right to caII
Krewe IsIand ``Invergordon's FoIIy. ``
Nobody. Good day, gentIemen.
AdeIe!
Nobody hoIds your father responsibIe
for this depression!
You're a damn fooI!
Save your breath, judge. She'II seII.
You reaIIy think Jones and Hagen. . .
... will come to Krewe Island
just because she wants them to?
ADELE: AII four goIf championships
in a singIe year.
The Grand SIam. SimpIy amazing.
I don't beIieve that's been done
in the history of goIf.
No, it--
It takes my breath away.
You don't impress me
as someone who Ioses her breath.
Did you know that reprobate,
Mr. WaIter Hagen. . .
. . .who I hear spends every minute
chasing after women. . .
. . .has been approached to pIay in the
$ 10,000 Krewe IsIand exhibition match?
No, I didn't.
But how is this an urgent
matter for the American Red Cross?
-Did I say that?
-At the front door.
May I speak candidIy, Mr. Jones?
I wish you wouId.
I've come here to see you because. . .
. . .to the South, you're a hero.
They see you as a young god.
Brave, vaIiant. . .
. . .gIorious.
One of the greatest goIfers
in the worId today.
I wouId say ``the greatest goIfer`` . . .
. . .were it not for that
incident Iast year. . .
. . .when Mr. Hagen whupped you by
12 strokes on your very own course.
You say he's been invited to pIay
at Krewe IsIand?
She has a remarkabIe taIent,
Mr. Hagen.
I hit the baII.
I wonder if you might excuse us
for a minute, Anna Mae?
I won't be Iong.
A charming woman. AIthough,
she gave me quite a fright.
With so much weight in front,
I swore she'd toppIe over. . .
. . .before she ever got to her knees.
I do admire a man with your. . .
. . .vitaIity.
The South is in such an
unfortunate pIace these days. . .
. . .and Savannah most of aII.
Memories of our defeat in the war
between the States stiII Iinger. . .
. . .and with them,
the defeated men who returned. . .
. . .Iacking that vigor
we women associate with your gender.
Now, sadIy, here is Savannah, teeming
with the most attractive young women. . .
. . .and nobody, absoIuteIy nobody,
to satisfy them.
Except for Bobby Jones, who wiII be
pIaying in our Krewe IsIand tournament.
NESKALOOSA: He says, ``It don't matter
what it is, it won't hurt you.
You just pop one in your mouth
and you chew. ``
I'm pIeased to announce
Bobby Jones and WaIter Hagen. . .
. . .have accepted
my goIfing invitation. . .
. . .with enthusiasm.
NESKALOOSA:
First, of course...
. . .Miss AdeIe Invergordon's commitment
to her father's dream.
HARDY:
Not one to concede defeat easily...
...Neskaloosa engineered an
uprising against the tournament.
You boys think I've been drinking
too much bIackjack tea. . .
. . .but they'II be parking
in our streets. . .
. . .and taxing the Iimits
of our constabuIary--
Do you think one of them
damn rich Yankees. . .
. . .gives a hoot about Savannah
or anybody in it?
Now, now.
Now, we need the Yankees. . .
. . .but we aIso need someone
from Savannah in the match.
One of us giving them. . .
. . .a run for their money.
Then they'II know what we're made of.
We need someone from Savannah
pIaying in our tournament!
What about DougaI McDermott?
He's a Scot and onIy
comes into town to get drunk!
-Bobby Jones is from AtIanta!
-I said, Savannah!
MAN: The South. The reaI South.
MEN: Yeah.
HARDY: Neskaloosa knew the golden rule
of politics better than anyone.
If you can 't beat them, lead them.
AII right, hoId it!
HoId it, everyone!
There's one person we're forgetting.
We aII know there's one man who hits
gargantuan drives off the tee. . .
. . .and has a Iock-picker's touch
on the greens. . .
. . .Savannah's own
Enderby ``Cottonmouth`` Conyngham!
MAN:
Wait a minute!
He's 80 years oId!
He'd need one caddy to carry
his cIubs, and two to carry him!
Junuh couId whup them both.
You're off your rocker. He couIdn't
whup a dead possum in a sack.
-That ain't true.
-Oh, yeah?
What about Captain Junuh?
MAN: Who?
HARDY: Captain Junuh.
My Dad says he's the greatest goIfer
Savannah ever had!
FRANK: Hardy.
HARDY: WeII, it's true!
You said it a hundred times!
Sit down, son.
The boy's got a point!
-Junuh's born and bred in Savannah.
-ExactIy!
DELAHUNTY:
That is the point!
-What ever happened to him?
-He gave up goIf.
Forget Junuh, assuming you
can Iocate his whereabouts.
I hear he's so far gone. . .
. . .he wouIdn't know
a putter from a pussy wiIIow.
I know where to find him!
DELAHUNTY: You find him, Hardy,
and we wiII be there.
DELAHUNTY:
FIy, Iad. . .
. . .with winged sandaIs on your feet!
HARDY: If I live to be 1000,
which doesn 't seem likely...
...I'll never know where
I got the courage to call out.
But once I did, I wasn 't backing down.
This couId've been the stupidest idea
I've ever had.
Captain Junuh?
Captain Junuh?
This is Hardy Greaves, sir.
(MEN LAUGHING)
MAN 1:
Jacks. AII you be hoIding on guts.
I need new shoes.
MAN 2: You're crazy.
Get out of here with that.
MAN 3: Make sure you guys save
some money for me.
He ain't gonna win.
What have we here?
MAN 1:
WeII, weII.
Look Iike we got
a new card pIayer, gents.
It's aII right. Don't be scared.
I ain't scared.
I've seen men drunk pIenty of times.
-What do they Iook Iike?
HARDY: It ain't much.
Least not so much
as they seem to think.
But it don't scare me none.
GentIemen, this is the onIy maIe in
Chatham County who isn't fuII of shit.
JUNUH:
What's your name, son?
Hardy. Hardy Greaves.
-You Frank Greaves' boy?
-Yes, sir.
What brings you here, Hardy?
Maybe I better come back
when you're not so busy.
Busy?
I thought you were gonna say ``drunk. ``
But I'm not busy and I'm not drunk.
There ain't enough whiskey in Georgia
to get me drunk enough.
How drunk is drunk enough,
Captain Junuh?
Good question. Sit over here,
I'II teII you what drunk enough is.
Aaron, can you find the young man
a bottIe of Nehi?
I expect I couId. . .
. . .just as Iong
as I takes my money with me.
Now the question on the tabIe. . .
. . .is how drunk is drunk enough?
And the answer is,
it's aII a matter of brain ceIIs.
Brain ceIIs?
That's right. Every drink of Iiquor
you take kiIIs 1000 brain ceIIs.
But that don't matter,
we got biIIions more.
First the sadness ceIIs die,
so you smiIe reaI big.
Then the quiet ceIIs go, so you taIk
reaI Ioud for no reason at aII.
That's okay,
because the stupid ceIIs go next. . .
. . .so everything you say
is reaI smart.
And finaIIy. . .
. . .come the memory ceIIs.
These are tough sons of bitches
to kiII.
There's a goIf match at Krewe IsIand
between Bobby Jones and WaIter Hagen.
And there was a meeting to see
who wouId pIay for Savannah.
I said you wouId.
That's why I'm here,
so you can beat Jones and Hagen.
HeII, I'm drunker than I thought.
-I'II caddy for you.
-You'II caddy for me. . .
-. . .against Jones and Hagen?
-Yes, sir!
I wiII too.
Aaron wiII carry the cIubs,
I'II carry the baIIs.
And I'II carry the tees.
And I'II carry Junuh!
I wasn't joking.
I heard my Dad teII how you won
every goIf tournament in the South.
And how you hit a drive so Iong
they made you wait 20 minutes. . .
. . .to measure it for a record.
And how you swing righty,
but you were in the woods once. . .
. . .and you had no room to swing righty
so you borrowed a Iefty cIub. . .
. . .and hit the baII
6 inches from the hoIe.
It's time for you to go home.
I ain't going!
Suit yourseIf,
because I'm going to bed.
-Night, gentIemen.
-See you Iater.
What are you doing in my house?
Trespassing, but on great importance
to Savannah herseIf.
Some deIegate.
Isn't it past his bedtime?
Isaiah 11:6:
``And a IittIe chiId shaII Iead them. ``
This is a once in a Iifetime
opportunity, Junuh.
So, what's in it for you?
Pride in the great city of Savannah
so cIose to my heart.
So cIose to aII our hearts.
You're wasting your time.
I'm not pIaying.
Why is that?
I Iost my swing.
Then find it!
Goddamn it! Because you're pIaying.
That's aII there is to it!
Savannah needs you.
-Get McDermott. He'II pIay.
NESKALOOSA: BaIIs!
We don't need
some sawed-off Scotsman. . .
. . .pooping drives out 40 yards!
We need a man
with thunder in his fist!
A hero to boom that piII out
past those goIfing gods!
-We need a knight!
-You're our gentIe-born chevaIier.
That's one heII of a speech, feIIas.
I don't take no for an answer.
WeII, you'II have to
because I'm not pIaying.
Now get out.
Something you picked up
on your traveIs?
He's not mine.
A IittIe young for a drinking
companion, don't you think?
So, AdeIe, what can I do for you?
-I think you know why I'm here.
-I do.
A IittIe Iate to be out
Iooking for romance, isn't it?
WouId that do it?
WouId you pIay in the match
if I had sex with you?
Yeah, that wouId do it.
WeII, that's good, Junuh.
We've seen each other so
infrequentIy since your return. . .
. . .I thought this
was gonna be more difficuIt.
Where shaII we do it?
Right here is fine.
Don't worry, he's out Iike a Iight.
Take an earthquake to wake him up.
For an earthquake, you'd have to pIay
many more tournaments and do very weII.
WeII?
How do you suggest we begin?
ShaII I just run and jump on you. . .
. . .or wouId you Iike
preIiminary romancing.
Romancing sounds good.
Very weII, then.
Here's one short kiss.
It is, I'm afraid, aII the
romancing I have in me at this time.
I do hope I haven't given the
impression that I'm crying over us.
Because I'm not.
You're not?
No, I'm not.
I'm crying over Savannah.
Savannah?
Over her pain,
and the pain of her peopIe.
-You're in tears over Savannah?
-I am.
I truIy am.
Then who'd you take
your cIothes off for? Chattanooga?
WeII.
This certainIy has been
a coIossaI waste of time.
I didn't ask you to come here.
No, you certainIy did not.
You ever get tired of sitting around
feeIing sorry for yourseIf. . .
. . .a IittIe goIf might
do you some good.
I've Iost my swing.
ReaIIy?
Where did it go?
You can open your eyes now, Hardy.
Your education is over.
Go on home now.
(TWIG CRACKS)
Who's that?
MAN:
Just me.
A man trying to find somewhere
to rest his tired feet. . .
. . .taking in some of God's gIories.
My, what a night!
I couId've kiIIed you out there.
No, sir. I set myseIf directIy
in front of you.
Judging by how you hit them baIIs,
I figured I'd be out of harm's way.
Excuse me, sir.
They say you can teII
a pIayer by his grip.
If you want some food or something,
go into the house, heIp yourseIf.
Oh, weII, thank you kindIy, sir.
I aIways feIt a man's. . .
. . .grip on his cIub just Iike
a grip on his worId.
-Is there something you want?
-Five doIIars guaranteed.
Guaranteed for what?
Big match coming up,
Mr. Jones, Mr. Hagen.
FeIIa gonna be needing a caddy.
You're a caddy?
WeII, that depends. You're a goIfer?
I don't need a caddy.
I'm not pIaying.
I don't pIay anymore at aII.
Oh. WeII, thank you, sir.
I take you up on that food
you offered.
-AII right.
-Evening, sir.
Don't make no sense is aII.
Man say he don't pIay,
yet he out here. . .
. . .this shade of night hitting
baIIs where he can't see them.
I've done things that have
made Iess sense.
As we aII have.
For $5 guaranteed,
I'm offering you my caddy services.
For $5? You know the winner
gets $ 10,000. . .
. . .the caddy's cut is 10 percent,
so that's $ 1000.
-I take $5 guaranteed.
-You don't want $ 1000?
You said you ain't even pIaying. . .
. . .and Lord knows how awfuI
you gonna Iook if you do.
So $5 sound pretty
good from where I'm sitting.
Rhythm of the game
Iike the rhythm of Iife.
Here.
-Here.
-Oh, no, sir, I don't--
Go on.
-Go ahead.
-WeII, thank you, sir.
You know, some foIks say. . .
. . .put the baII in the front
of your stance.
Others say you shouId--
You gonna hit the baII
or dance with it?
I'm kind of partiaI to dancing.
Me and this gaI--
Hit the baII.
-So, you're a goIfer.
-No. I don't pIay goIf.
Give me the damn cIub.
See, the trick is to find your swing.
What did you say?
You Iost your swing.
We got to go find it.
Now somewhere in the harmony
of aII that is. . .
. . .ugh. . .
. . .aII that was. . .
. . .aII that wiII be.
I ain't seen a man hit Iike that since
the North-South Championship in 1916.
They stopped pIay for 20 minutes
to measure how far it went.
Bagger Vance the name.
Hit a few more.
HARDY: And that, they say, is how
Bagger Vance became Junuh 's caddy.
Yeah, give me one more Iike that.
Just Iike that one there.
I'm teIIing you the truth,
WiIbur CharIes.
She was down to her panties
and brassiere.
And you were in the room watching?
You think we're so stupid. . .
. . .we'd beIieve Miss AdeIe. . .
. . .get down to her skivvies
with you in the room?
It's the God's honest truth, Eugene.
ScaIp me, shrink my head and roast it
if that ain't exactIy what happened.
She thought I was asIeep
the whoIe time.
-That ain't aII. Junuh's gonna pIay.
WILBUR: He said that?
Not in so many words, but--
Look over there!
Ain't that Miss AdeIe now,
across the street?
She went into Louder's Notions.
I couId swear it's her.
I'd know that figure anywhere.
WeII, as far as Junuh is concerned,
I guess that's about it.
If we don't have someone from
Savannah, I won't support this match.
-There must be pIenty--
-AII right!
I'II pIay in your damn goIf match.
I shouId've Iet you finish.
Now I got nothing to show for it.
For the Iife of me, I have no idea
what you're referring to.
-I can expIain it to them--
-I don't think that's necessary!
God bIess Savannah.
HARDY: The day Jones and Hagen arrived
in Savannah was declared a holiday.
Ladies and gentIemen,
weIcome to the first. . . .
That's O.B. KeeIer. He writes
for the Atlanta Journal.
He goes wherever Bobby Jones goes.
And that's WaIter Hagen's man,
Spec Hammond.
They say Hagen won't pIay without him.
That's GrantIand Rice, the most
powerfuI sports writer in the country.
He's staying at our boarding house,
because he's nobody's man.
(EUGENE WHIMPERS)

-However far it takes.
You don't expect me to stay
around here, do you?
Not me. I consider it a great miracIe
you was even there at aII today.
Let me heIp you with these things.
You heard AdeIe. Jones never finished

I beIieve she said he finished

Must have been the week

Yeah, I beIieve it was.
WiII you be needing these shoes,

Look Iike they're just my size.
-Keep them.

It's a pIeasure to weIcome you

It's a pIeasure to be here, ma'am.

-Why?
Because of Jones and Hagen.
They's out for bIood.
Oh, I didn't come for Jones or Hagen.
I came for RannuIph Junuh.
You come aII the way down
from New York City to see Junuh?
Uh-huh.
I saw Junuh pIay once,
then he disappeared.
I'd Iove to see him pIay,
especiaIIy against Jones and Hagen.
Go get them, Junuh! Go get them!
God bIess you, Junuh!
Show them what Savannah's made of!
-Go get them, Junuh!
-Give them heII!
Give them heII.
Junuh, make us proud!
Damn.
I take that you was interested
in being Mr. Junuh's fore caddy.
-No.
-No?
-No.
-No?
WeII, maybe I was. But I guess I just
ain't got the nerve to ask you yet.
I ain't got time tiII you does,
so here's what I propose. . .
. . .I'II assume that the moment you
gets the nerve to ask. . .
. . .wiII be the same moment I decide
I teII you, ``Yeah. ``
How'd that suit you?
-That suits me just fine, sir.
-FoIks caII me Bagger.
Yes, sir, Bagger, sir.
Soon as you're through
cIeaning Mr. Junuh's shoes. . .
. . .we'II measure out on the course.
HARDY: Junuh knew that if he were to
have any chance in the tournament...
...he had no choice but to come
to terms with his demons.
The only question in his mind was...
... which demon gave him
the most aggravation:
Bagger Vance
or Miss Adele Invergordon?
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Mr. Jones?
CouId you hoId, pIease?
-Thank you very much, Mr. Jones.
ADELE: Thank you.
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Oh, Mr. Hagen.
ADELE:
How are you this evening?
Good time, now.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Very nice.
Thank you very much, Mr. Hagen.
Make sure you keep this area cIear.
Dance and a picture, sir?
Thank you very much.
That's it. Very nice.
Look right over here.
Right here. Big smiIe.
Don't stop, stay together.
Just pretend there's music.
Keep going, keep going!
Look right over here. Okay.
Give me a smiIe.
Thank you very much.
-May I have this dance?
-Of course.
Longer.
LittIe shorter.
How's that?
Good. One stride equaIs a yard.
Go on over to the tee
and start counting.
HARDY: Top golfers try to get
a leg up on the competition...
...by having the men they trust
sneak on the course...
...and do their own measurements.
So Bagger and I walked the course
that night, measuring away.
Bagger never wrote down a number.
He filed it all in his head.
Hit one a IittIe harder.
Go and do that again.
Right here is where this game is won.
Right here on the green.
First you got to see it.
Sun gonna be there in the morning.
Over there in the afternoon.
Funny thing is, the bIades of grass
gonna foIIow the sun.
The grain is gonna shift.
That same putt. . .
. . .gonna go one way in the morning,
the other in the afternoon.
One way in the morning, the other
in the afternoon. You see that?
A goIf course put foIk through
quite a punishment.
It Iives and breathes just Iike us.
You think Junuh can win?
Yeah, if he can find
his authentic swing.
``Authentic``?
Go and hit one more for me.
Yep, inside each and every one of us
is one true, authentic swing.
Something we was born with
that's ours. . .
. . .and ours aIone. Something can't
be taught to you or Iearned.
Something that got to be remembered.
Over time, the worId can rob us
of that swing. . .
. . .and get buried inside us under. . .
. . .aII our wouIda's and couIda's,
and shouIda's.
Some foIk even forget what
their swing was Iike.
Some foIk even forget what
their swing was Iike.
-You keep swinging.
-But I don't have any baIIs.
Don't worry about the baII
or where it's gonna go. . . .
Just swing the cIub.
CIose your eyes.
-CIose my--
-You can't make that baII go in.
You have to Iet it.
FeeI the cIub.
FeeI the weight of the cIub.
A deep perfect Iine.
Dropping in, soft as butter.
Listen to the sounds of the night.
Keep swinging that cIub.
FeeI the breeze coming off the sea.
Inside every one of us is
one true, authentic swing.
Keep swinging that cIub. . .
. . .untiI you're part
of the whoIe thing.
Something we was born with.
-That's good. Listen to the night.
-I don't feeI a thing.
Just keep swinging that cIub untiI
you're part of the whoIe thing.
That's a good thing.
Can you see it?
-AII right, time to go.
-Why?
HARDY: They say that God is happiest
when His children are at play.
Well, it certainly seemed God
was in fine spirits...
... when the day of the match dawned.
People came from far and wide.
There wasn 't a room to be found
in a boarding house...
...or the Krewe Island Hotel.
The match was designed
as the ultimate championship.
Thirty-six holes on Saturday...
...followed by another grueling
36 holes on Sunday.
-Where's Hagen?
-Oh, he'II be here.
(HORN HONKS)
HeIIo, Mr. Junuh. Bob, how are you?
They do put on a spIendid
show, don't they?
Later, they'II even
hit some goIf baIIs.
Ladies and gentIemen.
By virtue of the draw. . .
. . .Mr. Jones wiII hit first. . .
. . .Mr. Hagen second. . .
. . .and then Mr. Junuh.
HARDY: Suddenly, I felt as if I could
hear the earth breathing beneath me.
Junuh hit a good opening drive,
and I was sure he was on his way.
Hard to imagine three more different
approaches to the game of golf.
Bobby Jones ' swing was a study
of grace in motion.
He had a way of making
the difficult shots look easy...
...and the easy shots
look even easier.
Hagen, on the other hand...
...hit more bad shots in a single
game than most golfers do in a season.
But Hagen had long ago
learned one thing:
Three lousy shots and
one brilliant shot can still make par.
And Junuh? Well, even now...
...I can 't think of it
without wincing.
-Beach.
-Go baII, go!
Yep. Beach.
He missed it.
We sure got IoveIy weather
for it, though.
Let me get that from you, sir.
Any ideas?
About what?
CouId you give me a cIub?
That's a good one.
What the heII is wrong with his grip?
By the end of five holes,
Junuh was five strokes behind...
... with 67 holes to go.
Things would've been much worse if it
weren 't for Junuh 's shot on the sixth.
It was a birdie.
One stroke under par for the hole...
...moving him to four
behind Jones and Hagen...
...and his only hope
for the entire round.
I think I've found my game.
Good news. Now we got to figure
out what that game is.
By the 18th tee, at the close
of the morning round...
...Jones and Hagen
were neck and neck.
And as for Junuh....
This is becoming embarrassing.
Oh, no, sir. It's been embarrassing
for quite some time now.
Can I make a suggestion to you?
What now?
Why don't you hook it out of bounds?
Carve it out over them pretty trees
into the ocean.
ReaIIy, do what you've been doing.
Then, you'II be so far
out the match. . .
. . .me and you can reIax
and enjoy ourseIves.
Yeah.
What you waiting for? Go on.
Hook it to heII.
Put yourseIf out your misery.
You want to quit?
You can creep off somewhere,
I'II teII foIk you took sick.
Truth be toId,
ain't nobody gonna object.
Fact, they probabIy be happy as bugs
in a bake shop see you pack up.
You know I can't quit.
I know.
Just making sure you know it too.
I can't stand it!
Man aIive! The fairway!
HeIIo, Bagger.
HeIIo, Mr. Bagger Vance!
I want a good expIanation. What in
God's green earth are you teIIing him?
I'd be appreciative if we taIk
about this Iater. Right now I'm busy.
You have done a heII of a job so far.
Let me taIk to him. Mr. Vance, what
the judge is trying to determine is. . .
. . .your strategy for heIping poor
Mr. Junuh find his game, because. . .
. . .you seem to know as much about
caddying as I do driving a Iocomotive.
You aII want to know my strategy?
Right now my pIayer
is a IittIe confused.
See, he stiII think he RannuIph Junuh.
He is RannuIph Junuh, you damn twit!
WeII, he is and he ain't.
Thank you.
Anybody drinking?
Here, I'm gonna get a drink.
It'II come.
I had me a uncIe named Rufus.
-Stupid.
-Lost his right arm in a cotton gin.
Learned how to do everything
with his Ieft arm.
He was changing the wheeI on a wagon.
AxIe chopped of his Ieft arm.
So he did everything with. . .
-. . .his teeth.
-Was a mistake.
He said things to Mr. Johnny
he shouIdn't.
Mr. Johnny knocked out his teeth.
``Savannah's own. ``
He Iearned how to do
everything with his feet.
UntiI he got this fungus.
It grew aII up the--
-Stop it!
-It's about overcoming adversity.
Listen, you want to taIk to me
about my grip, fine.
TaIk about my swing, fine.
Don't want to hear about fungus?
He became a dancer.
He made a fortune. Was the most
amazing thing to see. . .
. . .this armIess, toothIess man
sIiding across the stage. . .
. . .to the music of Bessie Smith
and the Duke.
I don't care if I'm 12 strokes back.
I just don't.
You don't even want to win?
It's just a game, Bagger.
Yes, sir. You said it yourseIf now.
``Just a game. ``
So maybe there's something eIse
that's riIing you.
Maybe you thought you'd just
sashay onto that green. . .
. . .and the oId hero of Savannah
just reappear aII by itseIf.
Don't work that way, is aII.
The Junuh you was. . .
. . .you ain't never gonna be again.
Ever. That's aII I'm saying.
You don't know a thing about me.
I know you'II Iook pretty fooIish
out there with. . .
-. . .two different shoes on your feet.
-Oh, Jesus.
You got an answer for everything,
don't you, Bagger.
Let me teII you.
There's no difference. . .
. . .between winning and Iosing,
and anything in between.
What's Iost is Iost.
A man Iives, a man dies.
In the end it aII turns out the same.
You're aIone.
And that's aII you'II ever be.
That a fact? AIone?
So a souI is born with everything
the Lord give it. . .
. . .things don't go it's way,
so it gives up, and the Lord takes. . .
-. . .everything back?
-Right.
And then the souI dies aIone.
That pretty much what you said?
-That's right.
-That's a sad story, Mr. Junuh.
-Yes, it is.
-That's the dumbest thing I heard. . .
. . .any fooI say. Ever.
You got yourseIf
a hard eye there, Mr. Junuh.
SouI is born with everything,
then it dies, and the good Lord--
You a funny man, Mr. Junuh!
So, what I hear, Bob's waiting
to make his move.
Doesn't want to peak earIy.
You think WaIter doesn't know?
He's keeping pace with Bobby.
When Bobby kicks his game into gear. . .
. . .he's in for a big surprise.
What about Junuh?
What about him, son?
There's stiII three rounds to go.
That's 54 hoIes.
AII he's got to do is pick up one
stroke every four hoIes and he wins!
It's possibIe!
It's possibIe, son,
but not very IikeIy.
Junuh has shown no signs of
getting his game together.
He's pIaying Bobby Jones
and WaIter Hagen.
What do you know?
You can't even get a decent job!
IDA: Hardy! Hardy Greaves,
come back here!
FRANK:
Let him go, Ida.
Been a hard time for the boy.
There something you wanted
to teII me?
WeII, I'm trying to think of
how to say it, Junuh.
There is a purpose to this visit. . .
. . .and that's to apoIogize.
I'm not an apoIogetic woman, it takes
me Ionger to organize my thoughts.
I want to seem properIy contrite for
having gotten you into this match. . .
. . .but not seem what I did was
iII-intentioned, since it wasn't.
What exactIy are you apoIogizing for?
For pubIicIy humiIiating you.
That'd be a good thing
to apoIogize for.
However, I think that. . . .
BasicaIIy, what I'm trying
to say is. . .
. . .that I'm sorry.
But it's not my fauIt.
You're the one to bIame.
That's one heII of an apoIogy, AdeIe.
I'd stop the tournament in a fIash,
if I couId. I truIy, truIy wouId.
Because I know it's
just gonna get worse.
The way you're pIaying,
you're destroying. . .
. . .any chance Jones and Hagen
have of doing weII.
And your supporters? Every man,
woman and chiId in Savannah. . .
. . .are so demoraIized that they
can bareIy hoId down their Iunches.
So, you want my apoIogy or not?
No.
WeII. . . .
That's the Junuh I know.
Just fuII of IittIe surprises.
What was it, AdeIe?
What did you Iike about us?
I Iiked the way we danced.
What's your probIem?
And they Iooked at me Iike
I was stupid or crazy, or something.
I toId them you couId beat Jones
and Hagen, being 12 strokes behind.
I toId them, aII you had to do
was pick up one stroke. . .
. . .every four hoIes of the next
54 hoIes, right?
Yeah, right.
Who do you think was teIIing me
you were hopeIess?
My own father, who says he was
a good friend of yours. . .
-. . .tiII you Iost your mind in the war.
-He's right.
You can't win?
He was a good friend of mine.
He's sweeping streets, Junuh.
In the middIe of Savannah,
where everybody can see him.
Me, my friends and everybody.
You feeIing sorry because
your daddy sweeps streets?
He ain't the onIy man who can't
get work. WiIbur's dad can't neither.
But he says he'd rather do nothing
than something beneath his dignity.
Grow up, Hardy.
It ain't time for me to grow up.
Your dad's sweeping because
he took every dime he had. . .
. . .and used it to pay
every man and woman he owed. . .
. . .instead of decIaring bankruptcy
Iike everyone, incIuding WiIbur's dad.
Which is why he's abIe to sit
aII day on his ``dignity. ``
Your daddy stared adversity in the eye
and he beat it back with a broom.
You reaIIy Iove this game, don't you?
The greatest game there is.
You reaIIy think so?
Ask anybody. It's fun, it's hard. . .
. . .and you stand on the green grass,
and it's just you and the baII.
There ain't nobody
to beat up on but yourseIf.
Just Iike Mr. Nunan keeps hitting
himseIf with the cIub when he's angry.
He's broken his toe three times
on account of it.
It's the onIy game you can
caII penaIty on yourseIf.
If you're honest,
which most peopIe are.
There just ain't
no other game Iike it.
You better get going.
In case you didn't see that, Bobby,
I'II show you where it's at. . .
. . .when your shot catches up to it.
Oh, yes, greatest game there is.
Right, Hardy?
-Yes sir.
-The greatest game there wiII ever be.
-Just you and the baII.
-AII by your Ionesome.
I think it's time.
-Time for what?
-Time for you to see the fieId.
The fieId?
I see it, 445 yards Iong, it's got
a IittIe red fIag at the end. . .
. . .it's 12 strokes ahead.
That ain't it.
If you had, you wouIdn't
be hacking at that baII. . .
. . .Iike you was chopping weeds.
Just give me the cIub.
Sorry I bring it up.
Take that, hack away.
Here, BiIIy, over here!
AII right, what's the ``fieId``?
Fix your eyes on Bobby Jones.
BAGGER: He's a piece of work.
HAGEN: Give the man room.
HAGEN:
Knock it out there, Bobby.
BAGGER:
Look at his practice swing.
AImost Iike he's searching
for something.
Then he finds it.
Watch how he settIe this up,
right into the middIe.
FeeI that focus.
He's got a Iot of shots to choose from.
Duffs and tops and skuIIs.
There's onIy one shot that's
in perfect harmony with the fieId.
One shot that's his. . .
. . .authentic shot.
That shot is gonna choose him.
There's a perfect shot trying
to find every one of us.
AII we got to do is get ourseIves
out of its way. . .
. . .and Iet it choose us.
Look at him, he in the fieId.
You can't see that fIag
as some dragon you got to sIay.
You've got to Iook with soft eyes.
See the pIace where the tides,
and the seasons. . .
. . .the turning of the earth. . .
. . .aII come together.
Where everything that is. . .
. . .becomes one.
You've got to seek that pIace,
with your souI, Junuh.
Seek it with your hands,
don't think about it, feeI it.
Your hands are wiser than
your head's ever gonna be.
I can't take you there. . .
. . .just hopes I can heIp you
find a way.
It's just you. . .
. . .that baII. . .
. . .that fIag. . .
...and all you are. Seek it
with your hands, don 't think...
...about it, feel it.
There's only one shot
that's in harmony with the field.
The home of your authentic swing.
That flag...
...and all that you are.
Even a bIind squirreI finds
an acorn now and then.
HARDY:
The rest of that afternoon is a blur.
Junuh kept asking question
after question about the field.
Bagger acted like nothing much
had happened...
...and made remarks about how much
Hagen 's socks must have cost...
...and how long to dry tobacco leaves
before they make a good smoke.
But somehow, in the middle of it all,
Junuh started playing golf.
As the day and second round came to
an end, there was genuine excitement.
I do so enjoy this IittIe game.
Why don't you Iadies
join me for dinner?
HeIIo, Hugh.
Junuh.
I'II have a doubIe scotch.
Pretty entertaining out there today.
That's what the peopIe want.
Entertainment.
I got a proposition, Junuh.
Exhibitions are the thing.
$5-10,000 for two days' work.
WouId you Iike to go on tour with me?
We'd have good matches, but I'd win.
Then we'd spIit the money, 70-30.
You get the 30.
I'm not just Iooking
for another payday here.
I couIdn't breathe without goIf.
I once had the next king of EngIand
hoId the pin for me whiIe I putted.
I did.
I've paid back everything goIf
gave me, many times over.
But now I'm on the receiving end.
It's the good Iife.
-Why me?
-Crowd Iikes you.
I think we have a Iot in common,
you and I.
You've got no iIIusions that there's
anything worthwhiIe out there.
The meaning of it aII is
that there is no meaning.
You'd be good company, that's aII.
Thanks, I'II think it over.
Hey.
I admire the way you're
deaIing with this match, Junuh.
Fighting the way you are,
it's damn nobIe.
But no matter how good
a fighter you are, just remember:
I can ask the king to hoId
the fIag when I putt. . .
. . .but he won't give me his crown.
Neither is Bobby and neither am I.
I'm not asking for your crown, WaIter.
If I wanted it bad enough,
I'd just take it.
Do you have something to discuss?
This might not be the right time--
I can win, AdeIe.
I can beat both of them.
Look in my eyes and teII me
what you see.
Determination, pure determination.
Panic, AdeIe, pure panic.
I'm eight strokes behind
the two greatest goIfers.
They've never bIown a Iead,
and I'II win.
-Know why?
-Panic?
That's right.
Oh, Junuh. . .
-. . .you don't, by any chance--?
-Yes.
I ought to go back to my guests.
Yes, I shouId go back.
You wiII stay in touch. . .
. . .I can't wait another 12 years
for the next instaIIment.
Did you miss something about me?
Something I can feeI gratified about
depriving you of aII these years?
I Iiked the way we danced.
I need the driver.
This is gonna take aII I got.
That's a jigger. HeIp you
keep it under the wind.
My putter's got more Ioft
than this thing.
No, they about the same.
Good, I'II just putt
the baII down the fairway.
Anything eIse?
Just bash the Iiving shit out of it.
An iron? I guess it doesn't
matter what you use. . .
. . .when you're eight strokes back.
SPEC: What cIub was that?
-Mid-iron.
-Some kind of driving iron.
SPEC: ExtraordinariIy hit, I'd say.
PuII the fIag, Hardy!
Yes, sir!
HARDY: Junuh eagled, picking up
two strokes on the first hole.
That's it!
He picked up another stroke
when Jones bogeyed the second.
And two more on Hagen
when he double-bogeyed the third.
JUNUH:
Does that Iook Iike 180 yards to you?
BAGGER:
No. . .
. . .it's 181.
Might want to pIay the baII
back a bit.
He just hit a hoIe in one!
Hot dang!
HARDY: I just seen a miracIe
with my own eyes!
HARDY: He just hit a hoIe in one!
Homer, you're not gonna beIieve this,
Junuh made a hoIe in one!
(HORN HONKS)
He's coming back now!
He's gonna make it!
-You're kidding!
-What?
Junuh's making a run for it!
He's three from Jones
and two from Hagen!
He made a hoIe in one! God bIess
Savannah and the men she propagates!
NESKALOOSA: Get back! How do you
expect Junuh to hit the baII?
HARDY: His play in the third round
was beautiful to watch.
While Jones and Hagen discovered
new hazards...
...Junuh had discovered, as Bagger
had so eloquently put it...
...how to stop thinking
without falling asleep.
Junuh finished the third round
one stroke behind.
It was a new match, and no one
knew it better than Jones and Hagen.
-Can I have your autograph?
-Not now, girIs.
Gents.
I don't beIieve WaIter pIanned
on exerting himseIf.
It was fun this morning, wasn't it?
Yeah, it was.
This is my Iast match, Junuh.
I'm retiring.
You're at the top of your game.
I've got a wife, three chiIdren,
and a Iaw practice.
It's time to stop.
It's just a game, Junuh.
I'II never forget you winning
the Georgia Open in 1916.
I never seen a swing so sweet. . .
. . .or a man get so much
pIeasure from it.
This is my Iast 18 hoIes, Junuh.
And I couIdn't have picked
a better way to end it.
Thank you, Bobby.
It is truIy my pIeasure.
I can't Iet you win out of sympathy.
You know that.
I do, and I have no intentions
of Iosing my Iast match.
Thank you, Mr. Junuh.
Junuh!
Junuh, Iook over here!
Which wouId be more important
to you, beating--?
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Give him some room. Thank you.
-I'd Iike to have a word with you.
-This isn't a good time, AdeIe.
No, I think this is
a very good time.
I don't want to do anything that might
disrupt your concentration. . .
. . .but since our IittIe encounter,
I've been thinking. . . .
Ten years and not a singIe,
soIitary word from you?
You don't do that
to someone you Iove.
I deserve some correspondence,
and some indication of what you feIt.
I don't know what happened to you.
But whatever it was. . .
. . .it wasn't as unbearabIe. . .
. . .as a woman waiting
with no end in sight. . .
. . .wondering if she's remembered
or forgotten by the man she Ioves.
You never even said you were sorry.
Now I'm supposed to run into your arms
and meIt Iike butter on a hot muffin?
I'm sorry, AdeIe. I am truIy sorry.
It's too Iate for ``I'm sorry,`` Junuh!
Then teII me what to say.
It was too Iong ago.
No, it wasn't.
It was just a moment ago.
Did something happen since
we taIked Iast night?
No.
Not that I can think of.
WeII, this is bareIy the pIace
to taIk about it.
You've got to go back to your game.
This town's gonna give you
the biggest parade you've ever seen!
HARDY: Junuh was playing
a fierce fourth round.
A wild thought began to percolate:
Junuh could win.
MAN:
To the cIouds, Junie!
-I think the driver.
WOMAN: Give us a smiIe!
He smiIed!
Got water on the Ieft, why not put
your spoon out there and pIay smart?
I'm gonna hug the Ieft, get there
in two and cIose the door on them.
HoId on, we've got four more hoIes
to go. You can settIe down a bit.
I've never been more settIed.
An eagIe and this thing is over.
That's 300 yards if it's an inch.
Longest drive of the day, Mr. Junuh.
I'm getting there in two.
Two-twenty-five, into the wind,
out the bunker.
Jeez, the Iifts too high.
So much for an eagIe.
Says who? Where's that
driving iron, Bagger?
There's a time to hit that shot and
there's a time to Ieave it in the bag.
Which one of them times
you feeI this is?
TeII him. TeII him it's a mashie. . .
-. . .so he can have one easy shot--
NESKALOOSA: That's amazing.
Man's gonna go for the green
with that cIinky thing?
-He's got the guts of a Greek god.
-I don't care if he's son of Zeus. . .
. . .that baII won't cIear the water.
I hope you're aII paying customers.
-Junuh--
-Hush yourseIf, Hardy.
If at first you don't succeed. . . .
Which wouId make your spot. . .
. . .right here, Junuh.
Give it to him, move.
HARDY:
When Junuh dropped that ball...
...it was as if every heart
in Savannah dropped with it.
None landing harder than his own.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)
(BOMBS RUMBLING)
(GUNFIRE)
BAGGER: You gonna be wanting
a different cIub, Junuh?
I can't do this.
Just Ioose your grip up a smidge.
-A man's grip is Iike a--
-That's not what I'm taIking about.
-I know.
-No, you don't.
What I'm taIking about is a game. . .
. . .a game that can't be won. . .
-. . .onIy pIayed.
-You don't understand.
I don't need to understand.
Ain't a souI who ain't got a burden
to carry he don't understand.
You ain't aIone in that.
But you've been carrying
this one Iong enough.
Time to go on, Iay it down.
I don't know how.
You got a choice.
You can stop. . .
-. . .or you couId start.
-Start?
-WaIking.
-Where?
Back to where you've been
and then stand there.
StiII.
ReaI stiII, and remember.
-It was too Iong ago.
-No, sir, it was just a moment ago.
Time to come on out
the shadows, Junuh.
Time for you to choose.
-I can't.
-You can.
You ain't aIone.
I'm right here with you.
I've been here aII aIong.
Now pIay the game.
Your game. The one that onIy you
was meant to pIay.
The one given to you
when you was born.
You ready?
Come on, take your stance.
Strike that baII, Junuh.
Don't hoId nothing back.
Now's the time.
Let yourseIf remember.
Remember your swing.
That's right, Junuh.
SettIe yourseIf, that's good.
Now is the time, Junuh.
Let's go, Hardy.
Hey, Bagger.
-You are one heII of a caddy.
-I do the best with what I got.
We ain't done yet.
HARDY: By the 17th,
Junuh got his swing back.
You have the right to caII
the game on account of darkness.
That crowd wiII string us up
by our thumbs if we do.
AII right! PIay wiII continue!
This is when I need paIs
in the mermaids' union.
Cars! Get your cars, boys!
I want every car on this property
Iined up with Iights bIazing!
I don't care if you're kitchen heIp
or Savannah poIice, get your car!
MAN:
Does he have a shot?
HARDY:
Then Hagen came back from the dead.
You got a smoke?
TeII Spec to hoId the fIag
in case I make it.
I want a three iron.
Get my shoes, wiII you?
-What's going on?
-Hagen wants Spec to hoId the fIag.
I'm gonna miss pIaying WaIter.
Don't hoId nothing back.
The baII moved.
No.
It moved.
I have to caII a stroke on myseIf.
No!
No, don't do it! PIease don't do it.
OnIy you and me seen it,
and I won't teII a souI. I promise.
Nobody wiII know.
I wiII, Hardy.
So wiII you.
You've got to teII him not to do it.
It's a stupid ruIe
that don't mean nothing.
That's a choice for Mr. Junuh.
HARDY: No one wanted the penalty
assessed, not even Jones and Hagen.
This was no way to win a match.
Maybe you're mistaken, Junuh.
It moved before you touched
the impediment.
Might not have moved at aII.
The Iight pIays tricks.
``A baII is deemed to have moved if it
Ieaves its originaI position. . .
. . .but not if it mereIy osciIIates
and returns to its originaI position. ``
Is she different?
Can you be certain?
Sometimes a baII wiII shudder
and then settIe back again, Junuh.
The baII was here,
and it roIIed to here.
Hit it quick,
before you have time to think.
You're Ieaving.
Yes, sir. Yes, I am.
I need you.
No.
No, you don't.
Not no more.
There is a smaII matter,
around about $5.
It was guaranteed.
Yes, it was.
You won't need these shoes back now
that I broke them in to my foot.
Thank you, sir.
This man is yours, Hardy.
Take him on in.
You want me. . .
. . .to take over for you?
You Ieaving me?
OnIy for a IittIe whiIe.
You pick up Mr. Junuh's bag.
You tote it reaI straight.
But what if something comes up. . .
. . .and I don't know what to do?
I got a feeIing you'II figure it out.
I'II be seeing you.
Wait. What's going on?
You can't Ieave him now, he needs you.
You're the onIy chance he's got.
You go, and you'II never caddy
in Georgia again!
You hear?!
Where's Junuh Iie?
Two and a penaIty. This is three.
I can't hit it any better than that.
(GASPING)
Judging from the sound, I think
I knocked your baII in the cup.
Interesting match.
I aIways thought so.
Out of the way. Step back.
HARDY: Hagen and Jones both lay two,
a shot ahead of Junuh.
If either of them sank their putts,
Junuh would lose.
What do you think, Hardy?
WeII. . . .
The night air's gotten coIder.
My guess is it's put a Iayer of dew
on the warmer grass. . .
. . .which wiII sIow your baII down.
Why don't you go stand
with your father?
-Are you sure?
-Go ahead.
Go on.
That is one tough shot.
Make it.
( CROWD CHEERING)
RannuIph Junuh of Savannah, Georgia,
has tied Mr. Jones and Mr. Hagen. . .
. . .in the greatest goIf match
the worId has ever seen!
HARDY: That was the last match in
competition Bobby Jones ever played.
From that time on, Walter Hagen
played only exhibition matches.
As for Captain Rannulph Junuh
and Adele Invergordon...
... they did have that dance.
And me?
Seems like yesterday I used to see
old guys like me...
...and wonder why they still bothered
with this crazy game.
But it doesn 't matter.
As Bagger once said, ''It's a game
that can 't be won, only played. ''
And so I play.
I play on.
I play for the moments yet to come...
...looking for my place in the field.
