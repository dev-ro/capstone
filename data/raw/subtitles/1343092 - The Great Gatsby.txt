"Always try to see the best in people,"

Back then, all of us drank too much.
The more in tune with the times we were...

And none of us contributed anything new.

I was disgusted.

<font color="#808080">DOCTOR:</font>

He was...

In the summer of 1922...
...the tempo of the city approached...
...hysteria.
Stocks reached...

...and Wall Street boomed...
...in a steady...

The parties were bigger.
The shows...
...were broader.
The buildings were higher.
The morals were looser and the ban...
...on alcohol had backfired...
...making the liquor cheaper.
Wall Street was luring
the young and ambitious.
And I was one of them.
I rented a house 20 miles
from the city on Long Island.
I lived at West Egg...
...in a forgotten groundskeeper's cottage,
squeezed among the mansions...
...of the newly rich.
To get started, I bought a dozen volumes

I don't want you
to get the wrong impression...
...from all these bizarre accusations
you must be hearing.
A pack of lies, I guarantee.
You've heard the stories?
Oh.
I will tell you God's truth.
God's truth about myself.
I am the son of very wealthy people
from the Middle West.
Sadly, all of them are dead.
I was brought up in America...
...but educated at Oxford...
...because all my ancestors...
...have been educated there for years.
It's a family tradition.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
The way he spoke.
No wonder people thought he was lying.
After my family died,
I ran into a great deal of money.
After that, I lived like a prince...
...in all the capitals of Europe.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
Oh, Europe.
<font color="#808080">GATBSY:</font> 
Yes, Europe.
Paris, Venice...
...Rome, Vienna...
...Zurich, Helsinki...
...Moscow, Istanbul...
...collecting jewels...
...chiefly rubies...
...hunting big game...
...painting a little, things for myself only.
Trying to forget something sad...
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
Just when I thought...
...it couldn't be any more fantastical...
- Then came the war, old sport.
- ...he became...
...a war hero, single-handedly
defeating the German army.
In the Argonne Forest, I took two
machine gun detachments so far...
We were outnumbered 5 to 1.
There was a half a mile gap...
There wasn't a single German soldier
left standing.
We stayed there two days and two nights.
...Saw were piles of dead.
One hundred and thirty men
with only 16 Lewis guns.
Every Allied government gave me a medal.
Even Montenegro.
Here.
That's from Montenegro.

"Major Jay Gatsby for...

And this is something I always carry
with me, a souvenir of Oxford days.
That was taken in Trinity quad.

...is now the Earl of Doncaster.<font color="#808080">
NICK:</font> What could I say?
The photograph was undoubtedly authentic.
Could it all be true?
<font color="#808080">GATSBY:</font> Of course, you don't need to take
my word for it, old sport.
At lunch, I'm going to introduce you to one of
New York's most distinguished businessmen...
...a Mr. Meyer Wolfshiem, my good friend.
He will confirm all I have told you...
- ...and vouch for my good character.
- That's not necessary.
<font color="#808080">GATSBY:</font> 
Oh, but it is, though.
I thought you ought to know something about my life.
I didn't want you to think I was...
Well...
...I didn't want you to think
I was some nobody.
You see, old sport, I'm going to make
a very big request of you today.
A big request?
Yes.
Miss Baker will explain everything...
...when you take her to tea.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
Jordan? What's she got to do with it?
<font color="#808080">GATSBY:</font>

Well, I was able to do the commissioner
a favor once.
He sends me a Christmas card every year.
I imagine he'll be at lunch too. Heh.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
By the time...
...we reached the bridge,
I was impossibly confused.

You know Oxford?
Yes, I've heard of it.

He wants you to invite Daisy to tea.
Daisy?
And Gatsby.
Why?
I don't quite know where to start.
You see, I didn't realize
until the other night that...
...I'd met Gatsby.
Five years ago. In Louisville.
It was the day I got
my new English golf shoes.
Daisy...
...was by far the most popular girl with...
...the officers from Camp Taylor.
<font color="#808080">DAISY:</font> 
Hello, Jordan.
One of them was...
...in the car with her.
It was Gatsby.
The way he looked at her is the way...
...all girls want to be looked at.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
So...
...tell me what happened.
Well, I don't know.
Charge!
<font color="#808080">JORDAN:</font> Gatsby was sent off...
...to war.
When the war ended...
...Daisy waited.
But for some unknown reason,
Gatsby couldn't return.
A year later, Tom Buchanan of Chicago
swept in and stole her away.
He gave her a string of pearls
worth $350,000.
But the morning of the wedding...
- ...Daisy received a letter.<font color="#808080">
DAISY:</font> Tell them...
...Daisy's changed her mind!
<font color="#808080">DAISY'S MOTHER:</font> What is this?<font color="#808080">

- Hand it to me!
- No!
Leave me alone!

Jordan, no one must know about this.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> What was in the letter?<font color="#808080">
JORDAN:</font> I don't know.
She wouldn't tell me.
But it was too late.
That day at 5:00, Daisy Fay...
...married Tom Buchanan...
...with more pomp and circumstance
than Louisville had ever seen.
<font color="#808080">MAN:</font> 
Congratulations, Mr. Buchanan!
After the honeymoon,
I saw them in Santa Barbara.
Well, it was touching, really. I'd never
seen a girl so in love with her husband.
A week later, Tom...
...crashed his car.
The girl with him was a chambermaid
at the Santa Barbara Hotel.
It got into all the papers.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> It's a strange coincidence.<font color="#808080">
JORDAN:</font> What is?
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> The fact that Gatsby's house
is just across the bay.
It's no coincidence.
He bought that house to be near her.
He threw all those parties
hoping she'd wander in one night.
He constantly asked about Daisy.
I was just the first person that knew her.
All that for a girl
he hasn't seen in five years.
And now he just wants me
to invite her over to tea.
The modesty of it.
<font color="#808080">JORDAN:</font> 
Kind of takes your breath...
- ...away, doesn't it?
- Evening, sweethearts. Where are...
...you kids going?
<font color="#808080">JORDAN:</font> Long Island, please.<font color="#808080">
NICK:</font> And you think...
...I should. I mean, does Daisy
want to see Gatsby?
She's absolutely not to know.
You're supposed to invite her over...
...so he can happen to pass by.
<font color="#808080">NICK:</font> 
I remember feeling torn.
Was it right to bring my cousin Daisy,
a married woman...
...together with a man I hardly knew?
When I returned home,
Gatsby's was lit from tower to cellar...
...as if for another wild party.
But there wasn't a sound.

If only it had been enough for Gatsby...
just to hold Daisy.
But he had a grand vision for his life
and Daisy's part in it.
It wasn't until the end of that summer...
...on the last night I saw Gatsby...
...that he told me of the life
he had dreamed for himself since...
...he was a boy.
You see, doctor...
...Gatsby's real name was...
...James Gatz.
His parents were dirt-poor farmers
from North Dakota.
But he never accepted them
as his parents at all.
In his own imagination,
he was a son of God...
...destined for...
...future glory.
Chasing this destiny, a 16-year-old
Gatz ran far, far away.
One afternoon, off the coast of Lake
Superior, he spotted a yacht in peril.
He rowed out and rescued the vessel...
...and its captain,
alcoholic millionaire Dan Cody.

Ha-ha-ha! You're crazy!
I can't speak about...
...what happened five years ago
because I didn't know Daisy then.
And I'll be damned if I see how
you got within a mile of her...
...unless you brought the groceries
to the back door.
But all the rest of that...
...is a goddamn lie.
Daisy loved me...
...when she married me...
...and she loves me now.<font color="#808080">

- No. I'm sorry, Mr. Buchanan, no.<font color="#808080">

No, she does, though.
She does. And what's
more, I love Daisy too.
No.
I love you, Daisy.
Now, once in a while...
...I go off on a spree. I always come back.
- A spree.<font color="#808080"> TOM:</font> And in my heart
I love her all the time.
You're revolting.
You know why we left...
...Chicago? I'm surprised
they didn't treat you...
...to the story of that little spree!
That's all over now, Daisy, darling.
That's all over.
Just tell him the truth. Go on.
That you never loved him
and this will all be wiped out forever.
How could I love him...
...possibly?<font color="#808080">
GATSBY:</font> Remember our plans.
You tell him that you never loved him
and all...
...this pain will be wiped out...
...forever.
Daisy.
Daisy, tell him.
I never loved him.
Never?
- No.
- No.
Not at Kapiolani?
Not that day I carried you down from
the Punch Bowl to keep your shoes dry?
Never?
Please don't.
Daisy.
There, Jay.
You want too much.
I love you now...
...isn't that enough? I can't help...
...what's past.
I did love him once,
but I loved you too.
You loved me too?
You loved me...?
Even that is a lie!

There are things between Daisy and me...
...Gatsby, that you'll never know.
- Things that neither of us can ever forget.

...speak to Daisy alone.
You see, you've got her
all excited now, don't you...
...old sport? Daisy.<font color="#808080">
DAISY:</font> Even alone...
...I can't say I never loved Torn.
It wouldn't be true.
- What?
- Of course it wouldn't.
- As if it mattered to you.<font color="#808080">

I'm gonna take better care of you

You're not taking care of Daisy

TOM:</font> No, no, no.
She is not leaving me.
Certainly not...
...for a common swindler...
...like you.
Mr. Gatsby, exactly who are you, anyhow?
I made an investigation...
...into your affairs. You're one...
...of Meyer Wolfshiem's bunch.
Please, let's go home.
See, he and this Wolfshiem...
...they bought up drugstores.
And sold bootlegged...
...alcohol over the counter.
What about it, old sport?
Don't you call me "old sport."
And this drugstore business...
...is just small change
compared to this bonds stunt...
...that you and Wolfshiem
have got going.
Your friend Walter Chase...
- ...isn't too proud to come in?
- I gave.
...that some thought.
How does a reputable banker...
...like Walter Chase find himself...
...up to his eyeballs in debt...
<font color="#808080">GATSBY:</font> I'll tell you.
- ...to a little kike like Wolfshiem?
- It's called greed, old sport.<font color="#808080">
TOM:</font> That's right!
And you have half of Wall Street
out there swilling your...
...free booze at that fun park
every weekend.
I'm surprised he hasn't
tried to drag you in.
My God, he has.
He's got nothing to do with...
With your little racket.
Daisy.
Daisy.
Can't you see who this guy is...
...with his house and his parties
and his fancy clothes?
He is just a front...
...for Wolfshiem, a gangster...
...to get his claws into respectable folk
like Walter Chase.
The only respectable thing about you,
old sport, is your money.
Your money, that's it.
Now I've just as much...
...as you. That means we're equal.
Oh, no. No.
We're different.
I am.
They are.
She is.
We're all different from you.
You see, we were born...
...different.
It's in our blood...
...and nothing that you do
or say or steal...
...or dream up can ever change that.
A girl like Daisy...
You shut up!
Shut up!
You shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!
