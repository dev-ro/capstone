I'm here now!
Can we hope for the same gesture
of humanity from Pakistan?
I can't speak to the Indian Army
General like this...
let's simplify this...
- Sir, General Bakshi has arrived!
Already?
- Should I ask him to go back?
Cameras off! No cameras
before the show begins
Are you in charge here?
- Yes sir!
Not anymore!
I'm Brigadier Shekhar Sharma.
The General's security
is my responsibility
Any problems with that?
- Not at all sir!
Good!
Capt. Vikram, Major Abbas...
over there
Major Karan
Come with me
Sir, security camera is in position.
- Good!
All positions secured?
- Yes sir. All positions secured
Good. Let the show begin
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to 'People's Voice'
I'm your host, Rajat Saxena
and today's issue is:
Project Milaap (Unity), a historic
step or a historic mistake?
The dawn of 15th of August,
our Independence Day...
will see 50 Pakistani prisoners
in Indian custody released...
at the Indian border
Let's meet the man
behind Project Milaap
Please welcome General
Amar Singh Bakshi...
the Commander in Chief
of the Indian Army
We'd first like to
congratulate you sir, because...
the Parliament actually agreed
to Project Milaap this very morning!
General Bakshi, do you really
believe that Project Milaap...
will lead to friendship
between India and Pakistan?
It's not so simple.
A chasm of fifty five years...
cannot be bridged
by releasing fifty prisoners
Then why Project Milaap?
- It's a step... to cover the miles
So according to you
they are all innocent!
None of them are terrorists
or ISI agents?
If we had a shred of doubt that
they are dangerous to India...
we would never have
taken this step
Most of them
are poor villagers...
who didn't even know
they had crossed the border
After all the border is not
completely sealed
They didn't even have weapons...
yet they have been in our prisons
for years... some since 1971
We feel it's time to
send them back home
But not everyone agrees
with you General
Some even want to stop you
Everyone has the right to
free speech in a democracy!
But some people
don't want to merely speak
Sir, I'm talking about Raghavan
The people would like to know
who Raghavan is...
and is it true that
he has sworn to stop Project Milaap?
Raghavan is a mask. He hides
his face because of his shame
He's a coward - a terrorist...
so used to violence
that he now fears peace
Project Milaap
will be successful
The prisoners will certainly be
released on the dawn of 15th August
Damn! Back up!
We need back up immediately
Come in
Major Ram reporting, sir!
I'm outside the studio
Maj. Ram, hold position for
two minutes! Back up is arriving
It's too late, sir.
I'm going in
Hello General. I'm Raghavan.
I'll ask you the remaining questions
So General, I'm sure Pakistan is also
releasing our poor villagers, right?
Exactly what
I was going to ask him!
When elders speak,
learn to shut up!
So General, what about
Pakistan's show of good will?
We haven't heard anything
from Pakistan yet
Then why are we being
so damn foolish?
Because someone has to
take the first step
If we all behave like you,
there will never be peace
We've thought about this a lot
And we are certain
that Pakistan will reciprocate
Pakistan! Pakistan is going
to laugh at us...
because they don't want peace.
- Why?
Don't the Pakistanis
love their children?
You do, General!
You love your daughter a lot
Too bad!
She will really miss you, General
No one can save you now
Ram!
Easy now.
You'll be all right, Sharma
Ambulance is on the way
I want to speak to my son
Ram...
Father...
Ram...
- Father...
Please...
Was I a good father?
- Yes father, but right now...
No, tell me!
You're the best father
in the whole world
I'm guilty son!
- No, father
Ram, listen please!
There's something
I've always hidden from you
You...
You're not my only son
I have a wife, Madhu
And a son, Lakshman...
your step... your brother!
Who I haven't seen
for twenty years
It's been twenty years
since she left me
Twenty years I have lived
away from them
It's time I pay for my deeds.
- Don't say this father
I knew you'll forgive me Ram.
Your heart is big
But until she forgives me
I will not find peace
My family will remain broken...
scattered
Promise me Ram, that you will
not immerse my ashes alone...
that both my sons will
do my last rites
Where is father's family?
Son, they left
nineteen years back...
Because I came here, right?
Dear Shekhar, I know you consider
what happened between us...
ten years back
a big mistake
I stayed away from you as I knew
how much you loved your wife
But today I'm helpless
By the time you get this letter
I may not be alive
I leave our son in your care
Please look after him.
He is your son, too
What's your name, son?
- Ram Sharma, sir!
Madhu... please
It was just a mistake
It was just a mistake.
- Mistake?
After marriage
it's called Infidelity, Shekhar
I'm leaving. I can't live
with this lie anymore
Lie? Are you calling
our marriage, our son a lie?
And what about the one
who is sitting outside...
your illegitimate son?
He's a truth too
And if he enters the house,
I am leaving
Where will he go?
It's not his fault
You're right Shekhar.
It's not his fault
It's my fault
for having trusted you
For my sake...
because of me, father
stayed away from his family
I will bring them home
They won't come home, son,
not till you're here
You can't go anywhere
at this stage, Ram
I need you till 15th August.
- I know, sir
But I made a promise
to my father
Then go ahead.
Project Milaap was his dream too
Ram, this is the photograph
Raghavan gave me
It's my daughter Sanjana,
in her college in Darjeeling
This picture was taken
from her college
A gun can reach where a camera can.
And it's my worst fear
Sir, why don't you call her back?
- Because she won't agree
Even if her life's in danger?
- You don't know my daughter, Ram
I haven't seen her
for two years
She hates me
Of course, it's my fault entirely.
I never let her come close to me
I wanted a son. A son,
who would join the army like me
That's why I never loved her...
like I would've loved my son
Today I can give anything
to catch her glimpse...
but she won't let me
Sir, can we not send a 24 hour
Protection Team for her surveillance?
Sanjana will never let anyone
in a uniform come close to her
If anyone does, she will run away
...she's done it before
So what do you recommend sir?
- I want you...
to go to Darjeeling,
under cover to protect Sanjana
I don't trust anyone else
I'm sorry, sir. It's impossible for me
to go to Darjeeling right now
I thought you may be interested
in this mission...
as there's another student,
Lakshman Sharma, studying there
Your father and I've been friends
for 25 years. I know everything
Call it fate or co-incidence...
but his wife Madhu and
his son Lakshman live in Darjeeling
You are now officially on leave
till 15th August
I've already spoken
to the Principal of St. Paul's
You are joining the college
from Monday
And what subject
will I teach there?
You are not going there as a teacher
...you will be a student
I'll look really strange
as a student, sir
I think I'm better off as a teacher.
- You can't stay with Sanjana...
all the time as a teacher.
- But I just don't look like a student
Besides, it's been ages since I
attended the national Defence College
Don't worry. Even the principal
will say that you are there...
to complete your graduation
which was left incomplete
But sir, the current generation...?
I've never even seen a civil college
I'll be caught in a day!
- Ram, no matter what...
Project Milaap cannot stop!
Those prisoners have to be released
on 15th August
But Sanjana's safety...?
No harm will come to Sanjana
I promise you, sir.
- Thank you, Major
"Like the winds sigh..."
"and the birds fly..."
"like the bumble bee's affair..."
"I roam without a care"
"I'm the queen of hearts!
What sadness is, I know not"
"With no fear,
I do and I defy"
"Like the winds sigh,
and the birds fly..."
"They can halt, they can try,
they can stop and ask me why..."
"but do I listen,
oh no, not l"
"I'm stubborn,
I'm crazy..."
"They say my mind is hazy..."
"but no one knows
where my dreams lie"

"Like the bumble bee's affair,

"I'm the queen of hearts,
What sadness is, I know not"
"With no fear,

It's odd, I've never seen my brother,
I've no clue what he looks like
But I'm certain
his eyes will be like mine
Actually I think he'd be
exactly like me...
calm, shy, decent, disciplined
And my heart says I will
recognize him instantly...
my little Lakshman

Friends, it's a truly blessed day
as today we have amongst us...
the famous student
of St. Paul's, Lucky!
When I came to this college
four years back, Lucky was my senior
When we first got here,
Lucky ragged us a lot, didn't he?
In the canteen, he stripped me and
made me sing 'My heart will go on... '
He's as smooth as so charming,
smooth and perky
We wanna fail school
just like Lucky!
I love Lucky!
Despite having failed his class
thrice, Lucky is still with us
And God willing,
Lucky may fail again...
and bless our juniors
with his presence too
And now, the moment
we've been waiting for...
Yes, it wasn't easy!
To fail consecutively thrice,
is not an ordinary feat!
But friends, with hard work,
perseverance and dedication...
you can all get here
And if I have your blessings,
I will continue to be with you...
right here, in this college,
for eons to come
That's a promise
Don't you feel any shame?
- Shame, Sanju?
Just look at these faces,
full of love, respect
And I won't need to study
this year as well
I've got you to copy from!
- Yeah, right
Irritating!
- Sanju...
Lucky, is Sanju your girlfriend?
- Avoid, man!
When Lucky has a girlfriend,
the whole college will turn to her
Who wants to look at Sanju?
- Hey, I only look at Sanju
Do you think she'll be my girlfriend?
- Are you...?
Oh yes. Why not? What a face!
What muscles!
What style!
- Oh stop!
You're perfect!
- I know
I have an idea! Let's arm wrestle.
I'll beat you and impress Sanju, okay?
Meet me outside
Stop it. You'll hurt yourself, Percy.
- Pain's my middle name, Sanju!
You think you look cool smoking?
- Yeah, yeah
Please! Give it to me.
- Avoid, Sanju!
Hi Mini.
- Hi sweetheart
Where's your miserable boyfriend?
Right here!
Quit playing with fleas!
Wanna fight a man for a change?
Would love to fight with a man.
But I don't mind fighting you either!
Who are you calling a flea?
- Scram!
The loser gets punished!
- And Mini will kiss the winner
Have you gone mad, Sanju?
- What'd I do?
You lost, Lucky!
- Time for punishment!
Whoever walks in first
through that gate...
push the person
and make him fall down. Simple
Hey what if it's a teacher?
Or the principal?
Whatever... man!
It's the principal!
Scared, Lucky?
Come here! Where was I going?
Home, sir!
Hi.
- Hello
Can you tell me
where's the principal's office?
First floor,
third door to the left!
Thank you.
- You're welcome
Sorry man, it was a bet!
What's your name?
- Wanna complain to the principal?
Avoid being a pain!
I asked you what your name is
Okay uncle, if you don't like
your face I can change it for you!
C'mon! You think you are tough?
C'mon let's fight, uncle
C'mon, let's go man
Is he our new Chemistry prof?
- What...? Oh God!
C'mon man, you are mine!
- I'm sorry
Behave yourself!
We were just playing a game
Lucky, say sorry. C'mon!
- Sorry
It's okay
Can you take me to
the principal's office? I'm new here
Hey, did I not say first floor,
third door to the left?
He's deaf too! Come on, Sanju.
- Excuse me, Sanju
Hello. I'm Ram
And I'm Lucky.
Now beat it
Tough guy!
Mrs Kakkad!
I'm going to fail them all!
Uncle, leave my hand,
grab it later!
I'm off, bye!
- The hag bores us to death
Shameless!
What are you upto?
Lemme go, uncle!
Hi handsome! Are you
the new Chemistry teacher?
No... I'm a student.
- Student?
I could just die!
I'm Mrs Kakkad, the Hindi teacher!
Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning
Meet me in the back side
when my period is empty!
I'll teach you everything
Oh! Such strong muscles!
What...?
- She means strong muscles!
Thank you. Thank you.
- Mention not
Finally I've found an oasis!
Very good ma'am! Excuse me!
- Sure
Everything is "squeezed" for you
Excuse me, sir
Major Ram Prasad Sharma, sir!
General Bakshi may have spoken to you
Of course. Why didn't you
tell me earlier?
Lieutenant Ram, right?
- Major Ram, sir
What can I do for you, General?
- Not General. Major
Look, no one except you know that
I'm not a student here
So no saluting!
- Right
No saluting
The thing is Captain...
please sit down
I had really wanted to join the army.
But I couldn't remember the ranks
So, what can I do
for my country, Sergeant?
Okay!
I'd like to be
in Sanjana Bakshi's class
Done! What else, Wing Commander?
And please stop saluting every second.
- Top secret, I know!
May I leave, sir?
- Bye, Cadet Ram!
Don't salute, please.
- Top secret
Sir, there is a student in
your college. Lakshman Prasad Sharma
Do you know him?
Just a distant relative!
You must know him
No, I don't.
I can't even remember names
Don't worry. Go to the ID office
at 9:30 sharp
You'll get all the information.
Okay? All the best
Over and out.
Tango and Cash!
Each man for himself!
- Okay!
Roger!
- Major, sir
Come on, Comrade
"Oh brother! Where art thou?"
"My dear..."
"I look for you..."
"night and day..."
"in every way"
"My dear..."
"I look for you"
"night and day..."
"in every way"
"Call me..."
"show me where
you're hiding"
"Where are you...?"
"I'm here feeling blue"
What do you say, Bro?
Hello.
May I sit with you?
You, here...?
- Hello uncle
The senior citizen bench is there.
- Shut up
What...? What are you doing?
Please make yourself comfortable
Three years of house-warming
should qualify this as your home
In fact, please consider
this your bedroom
Thank you, sir. You're too kind!
- That's me!
Sanju, a round cap today, eh?
I'll get you
a cowboy hat tomorrow, okay?
And why are you sitting?
Please lie down
In fact, on her lap.
I won't mind, and neither will she
You...?
Sit, sit
You're new?
- Yes sir
Then get comfy!
- I'm okay, sir
Relax. No, this isn't
a Temple of Knowledge
This is a club.
Am I not right?
Please put your feet up.
- No, sir
No I insist that you keep
your feet up. Please
Up...?
- Please
My feet...?
- Come on, please!
Okay, if you insist, sir.
I'll be fine
How dare you!
How dare you!
I'm going to set you right!
But sir...?
- Come with me to the principal
Follow me. I said, follow me!
Sir, if you walk ahead,
I'd be able to
Oh! You will teach me, eh?
Come on!
And quiet!
And no talking while I'm gone...
It's the principal
I was just coming to you
I want to expel this
not-so-young man immediately!
Go to my office and collect
your Leaving Certificate immediately
Mr Rasai, there is a new student
in your class. Ram Sharma
Sir, I'm Ram Sharma.
- Major!
I mean, Majoring in physics.
Follow me
Class! This is
our new student Ram Sharma
Ten years back due to
some family responsibilities...
he had to abandon his education
But now he's back to complete
his graduation
I want you all
to be friends with him
Now who will be his friend?
Sanjana!
I hope she doesn't know
you're shadowing her
No, sir. Not at all
How is she?
What have I done?
- She's different
Are you two friends?
Ram, I don't like being
compelled to be a friend
Fine.
- I choose my friends
And they are very special.
And you're not
Are you two friends, Ram?
Not yet. But we will be
There are two commandos
stationed outside the hostel at night
You don't have to worry
with me around, sir
Everything is just fine here
And father,
you don't worry too
I'm here now
I'll find them,
I'm sure they are close by...
near me...
Lucky, did you speak to anyone?
- Yeah. I've put an advertisement...
up on the notice board.
We'll find someone real soon
Fix the fuse, Lucky!
The lights keep going out
Did I not ask you to
And your dinner?
Welcome to Darjeeling, Raghavan
It was a choice I had to make
for the sake...
of my little brother's education.
I had to quit college
But I always felt incomplete
And one day as I ticked
'under graduate' in a form...
I decided that as soon
as my brother finishes his studies...
I don't want to hear your saga
I'm not interested in you
or your brother
Fine! Let's talk about you.
Where you from?
What does your dad do?
What's up, Sanju?
- Lucky...
Ram has turned into my shadow!
- Who? Our uncle?
It's the first time
a guy's after you. Enjoy, baby
What are you saying?
- Maybe she wants another guy, Lucky
Mini darling.
I'll be back in a blink
Hey micro-mini! Watch it
Hey Uncle!
Bell Bottoms!
Dude...
are you deaf?
- Selectively, yes!
What's up, man? Why don't you stick
with people your age?
Hang on!
There aren't any here
Is this how you talk to your elders?
- Look Mr Geriatric...
go do what old people do.
Sanju's my friend
So stop bugging her, or else...
Else what?
For you, I'll shut eyes and count
till ten... not the usual three
And when I open my eyes,
you better have disappeared
I think so.
- Thinking's good for you
Where are you running?
Am I a witch?
I'm coming... don't go away
Uncle, I hope
you've left for good
That's Sanju!
- You failed again!
Yet again! And this time
you've broken even my record
How did you manage
to get 3.5% in Hindi?
Tell you what, if you pass this year
I'll give you a "Cadabury"...
that too a milky one!
- Come again
She means Milk Cadbury.
- Yes, milk one!
Sweet boy!
And where's the other one?
Student name?
- Lakshman Prasad Sharma
Your name?
- Ram Sharma
Can't give another student's
information to you
Just find out if...
Want information? We'll take it out
from the college computer...
during the lunch break!
Piece of cake
How much longer?
- Almost done
This is a race between
Lucky and Vivek
Lucky, who is our favourite
And Vivek, who is a bit angry
So whoever runs upto the roof...
and gets the college flag
for Mini gets a huge...
Are you mad?
I'd just said race!
You guys will be rusticated!
Why? Are you scared, Lucky?
Done!
What's going on?
- Sir, a race is on
No one told me it's Sports Day!
Yeah! Race!
Lucky!
Lucky hold on! I'm coming!
Someone do something
Who's that?
Captain Ram!
I mean, I want to make him
the Captain of the Athletic Team
See how fit he is!
Come on Captain, come on
Who is this "Makko" man!
Ram turned out to be Rambo!
Let go, Lakshman
Don't look down. Let go
No! Are you mad?
I'll die if I let go!
Give me your hand.
- No...
Don't be scared
I'm here now
Let go
I didn't know you were so fit.
Were you in the army?
Hey, stop that!
You're okay now
No, no, why do you keep
calling me Lakshman?
Because Lakshman your name
But no one knows my real name
in the college
It doesn't go with the image!
You will not squeal, okay?
Okay. Image!
Stop trembling first
And what do you think of my image?
- Your image is set
Idiot! You freaked me out!
Didn't I say it's too dangerous?
What 'Okay'?
What if something had happened?
You didn't even think about
what your mother would go through
How do you know mom?
I don't. I mean...
you must have a mom,
- True. Everybody has a mom
Not everyone.
You are very lucky
Ram...
the other day I had said that
my friends are special people
Well, you are extremely special
What's that?
- Hey uncle...
Okay... come on
Youth! Wonderful thing
Isn't it, Khan?
- Yes, sir!
Such joy! Innocence!
Look at this boy
Has he even thought about
his future...
its dangers?
How it's rife with enemies?
No kid thinks
about these things, Raghavan
It's time to send another message
to General Bakshi
Shoot that boy
Shoot him
while Sanjana is around
And I want a recording of this!
Any problems, Khan?
But he's a kid
This is war, Khan.
Any war needs sacrifices
Our war was for the country
ten years back and still is
Remember?
We found some villagers
at the border...
who claim they got lost searching
for water. They are Pakistanis
You know very well that you are
standing on Indian soil
So get ready for a trial!
Are you Pakistani?
Don't be afraid. Answer calmly
Are you Pakistani?
Yes, sir
Trial over
Major Datta, on what basis
did you kill those eleven Pakistanis?
They were Pakistani spies!
- All of them?
Perhaps.
- Is it possible that...
some of them weren't spies?
- It's possible
And it's also possible that none
of them were spies
They were Pakistanis!
I feel ashamed of having ever
called you a friend
Ten years!
It's taken me ten years
to create my own army
I've handpicked each soldier
I never said it would be easy...
never claimed victory would come
without losing something
If blood must be shed,
then it must, Khan!
It could be ours, the enemies'
or a little boy's

What is this now?
- The loser must face punishment
No look,
I just lost because...
Sit!
And I sit here till when?
Until a girl walks
towards you from there
Girl?
- And until you serenade her!
Girls, singing...
I've never done that
Someone's coming!
- I hope it's not Mrs Kakkad!
Sanju! I can't sing
What the hell am I to sing?
"I'm just a little brave
tin soldier, sing with me..."
I should have stuck to the army.
I need a fresh new song... yes
"Buffalo soldier
...in the heart of..."
I got it!
She's the new Chemistry teacher
Ram, don't sing
No singing...
Swan song baby!
Wow! What a lovely sari
"My heart is the moon"
"You are the moonlight"
Just remembered!
Her name is Chandni (moonlight)
"Why is the moonlight..."
"so far from the moon?"
Is it my imagination?
Or were you just singing to me?
No! 'I'm just
a little tin soldier... '
Whatever!
"You have no choice..."
"but to return to my sphere"
"So go where you will,
go my dear"
"Go on, my..."
Don't watch!
You won't be able to bear it
No way! Such behavior
in this college, I will never bear it
By the way, which song was it?
'My heart is the moon... '
- My favourite!
'You are the moonlight... '
- What song is this?
'Why is the moonlight so... '
So old, and a student!
Disgusting!
So young and a teacher! Amazing!
Colonel, do you know
who her father is?
No. Who, sir?
- How the heck do I know?
Admiral, I know she is relevant
to your mission...
No, no...
- But apologize, you must! Go now!
A moonlight!
And what am I an eclipse?
"Makko" man!
You?
How dare you enter
the staff room? No...
don't stop me... I will have you
thrown out of the college, get that?
You punk!
Hey, this was in the 'Matrick'?
- You mean Matrix?
Shut up fatso!
Ms Chandni, if you command me
I'll throw him out!
No, thanks
Shoot!
- Actually they made me kneel...
and so I did because I'm a brave
little tin soldier!
They said a girl will come
and then 'when I saw you I felt... '
'like a blooming rose,
like a poet's prose... '
'like a deer in flight,
like a full-moon night... '
'like an endless search... '
'like the flame of a candle
in a far away church... '
'I saw a girl... '
In front of everyone?
Every time I see her,
I want to sing!
Must be our Chemistry!
- Shut up! Madame Curie!
Go and get the tickets!
- And we'll get the chips
I'll have popcorn
Guys, please stick together!
This place is new to me...
I may get lost
"I'll get lost"
What crap!
Why'd you push?
- Sorry!
Hold this.
How long are they taking, man?
No mistakes, Khan.
I want Gen. Bakshi to know that...
the bullet could be
for his daughter too
Record it. The girl should be
in the frame
What did I do?
In a hurry, my friend?
Looks like
your friends abandoned you
What's to become of you now?
What is he doing here?
He's a student, sir
Since?
- About ten days old here
Really?
Major Ram has been protecting her
for the past ten days, and you...
Because of your stupidity,
Khan has been caught
Commander, give me a chance
No Captain.
You don't know Major Ram Sharma!
He's the best
My departed friend Shekhar's son.
Looks I'll have to deal with him...
myself
It's going to be fun.
Gentlemen...
I promise you victory, and
that we will celebrate it with Khan
Who is Raghavan?
Our commander.
- A terrorist!
A soldier who can die
for his country!
No! He can only kill
What war is he going to win
by killing a young boy?
And what war are you fighting
by garlanding the enemies?
We don't want war,
we want friendship!
It's shameful that you have
sold yourself to friendship...
and we have to do your job
You may be in the army
but we are the true soldiers
You and your army is useless!
You are fortunate, Khan, that you're
in front of an officer of the Army
If we were like you, then
you'd have been dead by now
We have orders to take him
to the headquarters
Put it on hold!
Keep interrogating him
Though, I doubt if he'll talk
Is my jeep ready?
- Sir, where are you going?
To college.
To complete my studies
If the atomic weight of Oxygen
is sixteen...
can anyone tell me
the atomic weight of Calcium?
The atomic weight...
- Oh please let them be
Your hair look beautiful
when you let them fly
Really! When your hair falls
on your face it's like...
'I saw a girl and felt..."
'like a blooming rose... '
"Now that you're here,
and so am I..."
"come a little closer
so I could try..."
"to tell you
how madly I love you"
"When I first saw you
and began to get to know you..."
"I lost my sense of time"
"The fragrance of your body
cast a spell on me"
"And I lost my heart"
"Why are you this beautiful?"
"It makes us all wonder
and believe in things like fairies"
"Though your beauty
pales them to a blur"
"So, why are you beautiful?"
"That makes one speechless.
I'm lost and in a mess..."
"I'm obsessed"
"I worshipped you,
I desired only you"
"When I first saw you,
and began to get to know you..."
"I lost my sense of time"
"Now that you're here
and so am I..."
"come a little closer
so I could tell you..."
"what magic came over me
when I first met your eye"
"My first thoughts of you,
when I realized you..."
"when I really saw you,
and began to know you..."
"I lost my sense of time"
"The fragrance of your body
cast a spell on me"
"And my heart slipped"
Violins are playing.
In college
Ram? With a teacher? These will
turn into your funeral trumpets
Look at that.
- You saw that?
Nobody can see that
I've had this up for so many days
with no response
This is the problem of our college.
No respect, no discipline
Whoever did this has had it
Lucky needs a tenant!
I'm here now
Are you sure you won't have
any problems with me at home?
No problems. Grandpa's room is empty
and money's a bit tight right now
And if you're around,
mom will love you
Mom will love me?
- She always wanted a son like you...
Clean. But got me instead!
You two will get along superbly
And wait till you
taste her cooking
Mom's cooking!
- Yeah, she has only two missions
One, to reform me.
Two, to feed everyone
And your dad?
Ram, you're my friend
and all my friends know this
Do not speak to me
about my father
Never
That's our home
Lakshman,
there's no electricity...?
I'm history! Mom had asked me
to repair the fuse
I'll go and get
the fuse repaired buddy...
you go and calm mom down.
- I'm coming with you...
I'll be back in two minutes!
- No Lakshman, how will I...?
Just two minutes!
But how will I...? Mom...
Are you back, son?
What took you so long?
And why are you so quiet?
I knew you'd forget again
Do you know how long I've been
in darkness? We have a blown fuse
Forget it, I'll scold you later,
but first take the Lord's blessings
Oh Lord, I hope
he passes this year...
makes his mother proud
finds every joy in life
Who...? Who are you?
I thought it's my son...
- I...
I'm...
This is Ram, mom, my friend,
and your new paying guest
Ram, this is mom
I know
He's just your type
Bless you, son
Ram...
here, have it hot
Enough, aunty.
I just had loads... please!
Enough already? You're young,
you need more. Come on
