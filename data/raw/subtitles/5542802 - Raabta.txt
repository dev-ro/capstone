Tann Lade Toh Tann Mukk Jaaye
When just the bodies meet, they die and wither
Rooh Jude Toh Judi RehJaaye
When souls meet, they remain attached for eternity
Tujhse Kiya Hai Dil Ne Bayaan, Kiya Nigaahon Ko Zubaan
My heart has expressed itself to You,  It has uttered what the eyes have spoken
Waada Wafaa Ka Kiya...
It has made a promise of faithfulness
Tujhse Liya Hai Khud Ko Mila, Liya Duaaon Ka Sila
I have joined myself with You, I have taken the support of the blessings
Jeene Ka Sapna Liya...
And gotten this dream of life
00:00:50,00 --> 00:00:58,600
Dil Ke Makaan Mein, Tu Mehmaan Rahaa... Rahaa...
In the house of my heart, You are the guest
Aankhon Ki Zubaan, Kare Hai Bayaan Kaha... Ankaha...
The eyes are expressing all what has been said and what has been left unsaid
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta...
I surely have some relation with You
Kyun Hai Yeh Kaise Hai Yeh Tu Bata
Why is it so? How is it so? Please tell me this
Kuch Toh Hai Tujhse Raabta
I surely have some relation with You
