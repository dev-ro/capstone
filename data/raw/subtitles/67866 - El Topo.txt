You are seven years old.
You are a man.
Bury your first toy
and your mother's picture.
The mole digs tunnels
under the earth,
looking for the sun.
Sometimes, he gets to the surface.
When he sees the sun, he is blinded.
Kill me! Kill me, please!
Who did this?
Kill me, please!
Who?
Who?
- It was the Colonel.
- How many were there?
Another five men.
Where?
At the Franciscan Mission.
The Colonel is not selfish.
He uses women once,
and then gives them to us.
The Colonel
said he'd kill whoever touched me.
Who asked for them?
Do not anticipate my wishes.
Forgive us!
They have no soul.
But sometimes they get bored,
so I hand them the leftovers.
Ask, dogs. Ask!
Stay put, dogs.
Kiss them on the mouth.
Go on,
kiss the other one.
Stay put, dogs!
These animals like to watch.
They want to look at your breasts.
Eat, dogs!
Who are you to judge me?
I am God!
No, not that! Anything, but that!
Lay him down on the ground.
Destroy me. Depend on no one.
Cry, boy, cry!
Cry so he'll have mercy.
It's bitter.
Moses found water in the desert.
But people couldn't drink it,
for it was bitter.
They called the water "Mara".
It's become sweet.
I'll call you Mara,
for you are like bitter water.
How are we to live here?
We'll die of thirst.
As a hind
longs for the running streams,
so do I long for thee, oh God.
With my soul,
I thirst for God, the living God.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
- Do you love me?
- Yes.
I don't. So that I may love you,
you have to be the best.
Four great gun masters
live in this desert.
You've got to look for them,
and kill them.
The desert is a circle.
To find them,
we'd have to travel in a spiral.
I can't go on! Let's go back!
Whenever I start something,
I finish it.
We'll never find them.
If they are real masters,
they will give us a signal.
We have been walking
for days, months, years.
How can you have such faith?
They await us.
The signal!
You seek the light
in the middle of the day.
I know what you came for.
You'll have to wait to see him.
Just like that woman.
The master doesn't want to fight her.
The great master
wants to see you right now.
It's strange.
He's always kept them waiting.
After the dune, there's an oasis.
Your woman must wait there.
Let's go!
Give me your gun and hat.
I need no light. I am blind.
Count to three and try to grab it.
One, two, three...
How?
I try not to win, but to achieve
the perfect domain.
So as not to fear the bullets.
Shoot!
I bleed little now.
I offer no resistance to the bullets.
I let them pass
through the empty spots of my flesh.
Do you still want to fight me?
Yes.
I don't fear killing you
because there is no death.
I'll let you fire first.
- He's greater than I am.
- You'll win.
Even though I'd win, I'd lose.
I want a winner. Find out how.
Don't fight honestly.
Make up something. Cheat him.
There's always a way to win.
Find a way.
I told you so. I said you could win.
I am proud of you.
You have three more masters left.
I know where the second one lives.
If you let me come,
I could take you there.
It's here.
Wait.
We were waiting for you.
This is what the cards foretell.
You are falling. You keep falling.
The deeper you fall,
the higher you'll get.
Coward, murderer!
The Lord's will is unexplainable.
My son and I must respect you.
You may fight him.
Come closer.
The duel begins this moment.
You may shoot when you desire.
Dead.
Technically,
you're dead.
I now wish to speak to the dead one.
Follow me.
I began making copper objects.
And thus strengthened my fingers.
I now make delicate things.
I am so strong now that I can play
with this object, without breaking it.
Shoot!
A very delicate shot.
It destroys the precise.
You shoot to find yourself,
I do it in order to vanish.
Perfection is to get lost.
In order to get lost, you have to love.
You don't love. You destroy,
you kill, and no one loves you.
For when you think you are giving,
you are really taking away.
I have given myself to her.
I gave her all.
She's within me.
Her immense love fills me.
What I do and say,
is dictated and sanctified by her.
I hate anything that is mine,
for it turns me away
from her divine presence.
Two are better than one.
For if one fell,
the second would help him.
But pity the lonely one,
with no one to help him.
When I did it,
I didn't think it would be any good.
I only tried to do it the best I could.
Take your gun again.
My son wishes
to give you one last chance.
PROPHETS
Don't get near him.
Why do you follow us? Get lost!
There was no need to draw your gun.
I do not distrust you.
You have a flute.
We'll know each other by music.
You loath yourself.
You don't wish
to play tricks anymore.
You now want to respect the law.
Some give flowers,
others give valuable things.
You bring me your own life.
You don't fear death anymore.
That's why you are a dangerous foe.
When you were seven yards
from the corral,
my rabbits began to die.
Almost all of them are dead.
Now that you are here,
not one of them will live.
I made it myself!
See its fineness!
I'll take just one shot.
That's all I need.
One bullet, always deadly.
Shoot.
Can you tell which one you shot?
This one is yours.
It's been hit in the head.
This one is mine.
It's been hit in the heart.
The heart, and the head.
Swap them.
It's time.
Too much perfection is a mistake.
You won!
Don't leave me! You will be the best.
I'll help you. There's only one left.
You want to fight me?
How will you do it?
I haven't got a gun anymore.
I traded the gun for a butterfly net.
You'll have to fight with your fists.
Strike! Strike! Strike!
You see, my net
is mightier than your bullets.
If you shoot again,
it will go back into your heart.
How could you win?
For I don't fight, I have nothing.
Even though you cheated,
you couldn't have taken anything.
Yes, I could have taken your life.
Life! I don't care about that.
I'll show you.
You lost.
You won! You are the best.
I have been spilt like water,
and my bones have been dislocated.
My heart has turned
to wax and melts within me.
And my tongue sticks to my jaw.
I am laid low in the dust of death.
My God,
why hast thou forsaken me?
Why are You so far from saving me,
from heeding my groans?
Oh, my God, I cry in the daytime,
but thou dost not answer.
In the night I cry, but I get no respite.
It's either him or me?
Make thy paths known from me.
Oh, Lord, teach me thy ways.
Lead me in thy truth and teach me.
Thou art God, my savior.
I have waited all day long
for thee.
You'll show the sinners the way.
You'll lead us
through final judgment.
PSALMS
I am not a God.
I am a man.
How long have I been here?
When you got here,
I hadn't yet been born.
I've looked after you
since I was a child.
The old woman says
that you'll free us. Come!
We've been prisoners
here for many years.
That hole is the only way out.
You have to climb
for a few days to get to it.
Outside, down the mountain,
there's a town.
They won't help us to get out.
We are deformed,
due to the continuous incest.
We are repulsive to them.
It must be hard to bring me here.
Why did you do it?
The old lady knows.
She sent for you.
She wants to see you now.
This is not me! This is not my face.
I'll get money and I'll dig a tunnel.
The tunnel will join
the town with this cave.
When I finish it, you'll be free at last.
You'll get out of here!
So, that's the great town!
We'll have to beg.
Fix the curls.
Fix my nails!
Cream!
A fan!
This degenerate
is looking at my legs!
Help, he's embracing me!
You are witnesses!
He's kissed me by force!
Filthy slave! How dare you!
Help, he's raping me!
Stop him! Murderer!
Stop him! Don't let him get away!
Rapist! He's a degenerate!
Murderer, murderer!
Do you think it's worth it
for my people to come here?
This is worse.
I'll keep on digging.
How many meters have we dug?
I dig!
We've lost our audience!
Hey, you monsters! Come here!
We'll pay you a good fee.
Both are dead.
- Who died first?
- This one.
This one is the champion.
You protect us, oh Lord!
You protect us, oh Lord!
God loves us and protects us!
If we have faith,
nothing will happen to us.
We must play with our Lord.
Death is our bet.
And let the one
who doesn't have faith, die.
A miracle!
A miracle!
A miracle!
Fear not, it's a blank.
The weapon. It's a miracle!
A miracle!
APOCALYPSE
No one will come anymore.
The circus is over.
I'll go also.
Come in, come in!
As always,
the Decent Women League,
after it's monthly inspection,
greets their husbands.
Everything in here is decent.
Do you want to make some money?
Come, come!
Go down!
Come in!
Do your kissing stunt.
We now want to see the rest.
Undress! The wedding night!
I love you. They do not exist.
There's nobody, but you.
We're alone. Take me, please.
We'll be able to buy dynamite
to keep digging the tunnel.
Hey, why are you hiding?
I am ashamed.
You must be disgusted by me.
You are going to leave me.
No, come with me.
Tell him to marry us.
Go!
We are going to get married, Father.
You can't kill him.
He's doing great things.
He promised he'd dig the tunnel,
so they would be free.
I'll wait until you finish the job.
Then I will kill you.
But I'll be watching you,
so you don't escape.
We'll never finish it.
It takes too much time.
If you want us to go faster,
help us to dig.
And if you want to finish sooner,
help us to beg.
It's hard rock.
We've tried it a thousand times
and we can't do it.
Just a thousand times?
Your pain must be unbearable.
This body feels the pain, not me.
You'll never do it. Stop it!
We've made it! We've made it!
Do not tell them yet.
They are still unprepared.
I cannot kill my master.
