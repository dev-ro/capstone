Madam, this child is a witch.
From the time that this child
came into the village,
Lots of strange things
have been happening,
things that never
used to happen.
Strange things have been
happening in the village
since she got here.
We don't know where
she came from.
She has no friends,
she has no relatives,
she wanders around
like a lost person.
This is what I'm saying, madam.
She's a witch.
This child is a witch.
From the day it happened,
no-one draws water
from that well,
not for drinking,
not for bathing,
because we're scared,
because of this witch.
This child is a witch.
I'm telling you, this
girl is a witch.
This is the water?
This is what I'm saying, madam.
She's a witch.
You're making noise?
What do you want?
I have something to say as well.
I'm a witness.
Yes, I am a witness.
This girl is a witch.
I was ploughing my field,
like I always do,
when I noticed a small shadow.
It came above me,
on top of my head.
I didn't take any notice,
I thought it was just a cloud.
Then... I heard laughter.
I looked around...
and I saw this girl.
The child sitting here?
The same one... just
standing there.
What was she doing?
She was just standing there.
Yes, she was just
standing there.
And what did you do?
Then I looked again and
realised she had an axe.
Now, do you know
what happened next?
She hit me with the axe!
She hit me across the arm.
Then my arm fell to the ground.
Then all my blood
splashed on the ground.
So what did you do after
your arm fell off?
Well...
Ever since I had that dream...
It was just a dream!
Now my wife is the one
that goes to the field...
alone.
Are you done?
Yes. Aren't you going to
write down my statement?
- Leave! We've heard you.
- OK. I'll go.
See all those people outside...
and her?
They're saying you're a witch.
What's your name?
Answer!
She's a witch.
Yes, she's a witch.
Your back?
Let me...
Just turn a little bit.
It's fine.
Is that my phone?
Is that the phone ringing?
- Is that my phone?
- Yes.
I'm coming. I'm coming, baby.
I don't know the number.
I don't know who it is.
I am a witch doctor, a real one.
I'm very well-known.
I've helped a lot of people.
I've helped lots of people.
Children have been healed.
So you know that I am
a real witch doctor,
I'll take all my clothes off.
There, I've taken them off.
See, I don't have
anything to hide.
See? I don't have anything.
Nothing.
Now you see I'm a witch doctor.
This chicken,
if it dies inside the circle,
it means she's not a witch.
If it dies outside the circle,
it means she is a witch.
Go on. Dance.
The way you were
doing it before.
Are you tired?
Keep going.
Why are you so surprised?
This is your new member.
Aren't you happy?
How can you run away?
Bring her here.
A little child like you,
causing us all this trouble...
You should be grateful.
So, working together,
witches, civil servants...
You should teach this girl
how you live as witches in
cooperation with the Government.
Now, I want you
to sing that song
we always sing on
these occasions,
so she feels welcome,
like we usually do.
Where's that woman that leads?
We're soldiers for the
Government and we're used to it.
We're used to it and
don't get tired.
We're soldiers for the
Government and we're used to it.
We're used to it and
don't get tired...
Stand up, little girl.
I believe the ladies have
explained everything.
Now it's up to you,
whether to be a goat or a witch.
If you choose to be a
goat, cut the ribbon.
But, if you choose
to be a witch,
keep your ribbon intact.
Then you'll join
this witch camp.
- Mannaseh!
- Sir?
Bring the knife.
Here's the knife.
Go into that little house.
In the morning,
we'll know which you've chosen.
Go.
Make some noise, ladies.
Hello.
Is there a witch in there?
Yes, there's a witch in here.
Come out, you witch!
There is the witch.
Come out, come out, come out.
What I'm doing here is just
a little bit of scarring.
It'll heal quickly. Don't worry.
It's just like a
tattoo I'm giving you.
Don't worry, it'll heal.
They're just tattoos.
They'll heal.
Don't worry, you don't
have to be scared.
Don't be scared.
They are just like little cuts.
I'll put some of this on
to make it heal quickly.
I'm exhausted, I can't.
Mr Tembo!
How can you wake me up
this early for work?
Mr Tembo!
You're so mean, Mr Tembo.
How can I go farming?
I'm too tired.
- Mr Tembo!
- This is too much.
You, little girl.
You're so lucky.
Mrs Dettol only had a
short ribbon, like this.
She couldn't turn around.
She couldn't go anywhere.
You're really lucky,
you have a long ribbon.
You're free to go
this way and that,
you can go here and there
with your long ribbon.
You're so lucky.
You should be eating.
This girl...
I've named her Shula.
It's a nice name.
It's a very nice name.
Listen, it means to be uprooted.
This girl has been uprooted.
It's a very nice name.
Keep eating. Keep eating, child.
It's a really lucky name.
Mr Tembo!
When I die, I Will kill you.
When my spirit awakens,
I'll kill all your family.
I don't want Shula to
work in the fields.
Hold this close to your ear.
Point it in the direction of the wind.
Do you understand?
Can you hear anything?
There are kids playing over there,
where the noise is coming from.
Shula, have you ever
been to school?
Never been to school?
You know what? Every time
we go to work on the farms,
there's always a school nearby.
If you go there,
there's a school.
Everywhere we work,
there's a school nearby.
So I want you to listen
to these schools.
They're taking Shula away.
They can't just take her. Why would they?
She's too little.
Shula is just too little.
What's the problem here?
It's about Shula, how
can you take her?
When I needed someone,
did they not refuse?
They did.
We didn't refuse at all.
Little girl, put it on.
Just apply.
Grandpa, come and stand here.
Grandpa, just come
and stand here.
Grandpa, switch
off that phone...
This is a court room,
you don't do that.
If you have a phone,
just switch it off.
Switch them off right now.
Switch them off. Switch
them off completely.
Have you switched
it off, grandpa?
- What?
- Wait.
Switch it off.
Anyone else with a phone...
Shut down your phones.
Your phone is ringing as
if you've got credit!
Start.
I am here in court
to find out who took my money.
Grandpa,
switch off your phone.
- I can't see because of the sun.
- Switch it off!
- Remove the battery.
- Take out the battery.
Let me help you.
You, switch it off.
Remove the battery.
Can I start now?
I'm here in court
because someone stole
my dowry money.
To whoever stole it,
what goes around comes around.
Thank you.
Thank you, sit down.
What goes around...
- comes around.
- Good.
All the suspects, you
know who you are?
All the suspects stand up.
Suspect number one, let's go.
Did you steal the money or not?
No, I didn't.
Did you steal the money or not?
No, I didn't.
Did you steal the money or not?
No, I didn't steal it.
Did you steal the money or not?
No, I didn't.
Hello, Grandma.
It's me Shula.
What is it, Shula?
They've lined up
all the suspects
but I don't know who it is.
Can you help me pick one?
Pick the dark one.
The one who looks scared.
The one who's looking up.
The one who looks
down at the ground.
- But...
- He'll be the one.
But there are three dark ones.
The one who looks nervous.
He's the one.
One of you is the culprit.
We will now consult the spirits.
She will point out
who the culprit is.
- Do we agree?
- We do.
Which one of these
idiots did it?
It's the one wearing red.
The one in red? Good.
- You wearing the...
- It's not me, Boss.
She's picked you. Why
are you denying it?
As God is my witness,
sir, it's not me.
- Who did she point to?
- Him.
- Why are you refusing?
- It's not me.
She pointed to say you did it.
As God is my witness...
- What?
- As God is my witness.
God? Is God here?
- She picked you.
- I didn't, boss.
I'm being falsely accused.
Listen, everyone, you're
all still suspects.
- Suspects.
- Until we've searched him.
She picked you but
you're arguing,
so all of you are
still suspects.
Good. Suspects!
We have surrounded
the whole house.
How are you?
- Is this Nelson's place?
- Yes.
Get everyone out.
- Sit over there.
- Hurry, we've got work to do.
- Are you Nelson's wife?
- Yes.
Sit over there.
Go over there.
Are they all coming
out of this house?
Is this a house or a coach?
I said sit down over there.
Get her out as well.
Is everyone out?
Hey you, little witch, you're
saying I stole the money.
It wasn't me. You're lying.
When they find out it's not me,
we'll stone you or burn you alive.
You're telling lies,
you and grandpa.
Once I'm cleared, we'll
burn you and stone you.
Just tell the truth.
This affects us all.
He's innocent, guys.
She's lying. He says
he didn't do it.
He should just tell the truth.
Weren't you denying it, saying
you didn't know anything?
Get out of the way.
Thief!
Go!
It's you who stole it.
You Will hurt him!
He's a thief!
Hit him!
- What?
- Let me get the basket.
Shula.
How did you know that
he was the thief?
Out of all of them, how
did you know it was him?
You are a witch, right?
You really are a witch.
You are my little witch.
Right? My little witch.
We will leave those old
ladies working on the farms.
You and I, we'll work together.
Shula, my little witch.
My little witch.
You and me, we'll
work together, right?
You are very good.
You're a nice witch.
See, the offerings
are now coming.
Thank you.
She's saying hello.
Hi!
Our visitor has arrived.
It's good she's come.
Welcome.
- Let's go.
- You are welcome.
It's good you brought her.
It's really good.
I'm happy that you've come.
I've been waiting for you.
I will see you.
I am so happy that you've come.
Now, listen.
I'm going to pour some gin here.
It's not disrespectful.
If any witch comes here,
I get scared that bad
spirits might come in.
I don't want bad spirits
entering the house,
only good spirits,
do you understand?
Don't think about
it in a bad way.
I only want good
spirits coming in.
Do you know what I
want to show you?
This is a chandelier.
Say chandelier.
When you switch on
the lights at night,
it's really something to see.
Just uncover it.
You have one as well?
You're shocked.
Come and sit over here
and I'll explain.
I used to be like you
when I was a kid.
Like you, they used to
take me out all the time.
I used to be taken
around in a truck.
They used to follow
me everywhere.
They said I couldn't
go anywhere,
they said I couldn't cut
the ribbon or do anything.
They said if I cut the ribbon,
I'd turn into a goat.
Now, I didn't turn into a goat.
And do you know why?
Respectability. Do you
know what that is?
Respect through marriage.
Do you know how I
became this way?
Because I did
everything I was told.
I did everything I was told.
If I was told do this, do that,
go here and go there.
I did it all without question.
I had respect.
So, if you do the same,
you'll be just like me,
maybe even better.
Do you know how to hook it?
Now turn around.
Turn and look.
Can you see?
Do you want to call Grandma?
No.
- It's that one.
- Which one?
This one in front.
The one with the big nose?
This one?
She's picked you.
Shula's picked you.
Shula's picked you, talk.
There's no water.
Mum, how are you?
And who's that?
- Mr Phiri, a teacher, he gave me a lift.
- Whatever.
Go!
You're here again?
You stupid man!
You idiot, didn't I tell you...
don't come here! You're the one
who accused me of witchcraft!
You idiot!
You're brainless.
If you had any sense,
you'd feel sorry for me.
I'm suffering here because
he called me a witch.
You're one of the reasons why
I'm suffering. You're stupid.
- He's the only man who loves me.
- Shut up!
What do you want me
to do, leave him?
Look in the mirror, see
how nice it looks.
Just pull the fringe
down in front.
See?
It's nice. Honestly,
you're gorgeous.
Madam, try the "Mandonna",
see how it looks.
This one has a
natural curl in it.
Pull it down to
hide those tattoos.
Hide those tattoos
on your forehead.
Gosh, I look nice.
Honestly, I really do.
Madam, what did you ask for?
- The brown one?
- The brown one.
I couldn't find a brown one,
it's gone out of fashion.
That's why I brought you the latest one.
"Rahinna".
- You know the American musician?
- Yes.
It's really fashionable.
Let's have a look.
That one's nice.
This is nice.
You are gorgeous.
Check in the mirror.
- This is really nice.
- It really is.
Ladies!
Mama...
I see you've all got wigs on.
How are you paying for them?
Credit.
We'll use the offerings Shula
brings back from her job.
Ladies, how can you depend on
Shula, on a little girl like that?
You're depending on her to
get credit for your wigs?
Come on, let's not get jealous.
Let's get down to business.
Now, for payment...
Auntie, for that one,
the "Minny Mikaj" one,
together with the
"Sim Kardashan" one,
you can give me two
bottles of gin.
For the...
I've already told you,
for the "Beyancey"
I'll charge you two gins.
You.
What are you doing in there?
Are you a witch?
What are you doing in there?
What are...
I've caught you, I've
found you today.
You're the witch that
ate all my relatives.
Come outside!
I am coming in there!
You'll see what will happen
to you once I get in there!
You come outside!
Come outside!
Do you live there? Come out!
Hey!
Yes sir?
There's a witch.
- There's a witch inside!
- What witch?
Haven't you seen the witch sir?
- I'll slap you.
- Let the witch come out.
That is a witch!
No.
But sir, can't you see...
Add some more.
This is time to celebrate,
now we've grown old,
we have grey hair.
This is the age to eat, this
is the age of grey hair.
We're old, put some more for me.
Let's drink, let's drink.
Let me first drink this...
Troubled thoughts.
These troubled thoughts
have conquered us.
You get the next bottle.
When they come today
I'll kick you.
When we arrive, make sure you do
everything I showed you at home.
You understand?
Make sure you do exactly as
we did before, understand?
Don't be scared or
anything like that.
Everything I taught you before. You
did really well. You understand?
Exactly!
Did I put the gin in the car?
Maybe I left it on the table?
Or where did I leave it?
Check to see if I put
the gin in my handbag?
Look carefully.
No, it's not here.
There's nothing?
My God. What am I going to do?
Witch!
There's a witch!
Everyone, come and
see the witch!
There it is.
Come and see.
What?
What's your problem?
Leave me alone.
What is it?
What is your problem?
No.
I've got respectability,
I'm a married woman.
What is your problem?
Have you ever seen a
witch looking like this?
See! I knew it!
There, you see that?
We know them.
She's the one.
Do you know that I'm married?
Go away.
Get out of the way.
You think we don't
know what that is?
Kill it!
Leave me alone.
Shula.
Shula.
Look at me, cheer up.
You're fine right?
Start doing what we
practised at home.
Rain! It will rain.
It will rain. It will rain.
It will rain. It will rain.
The spirits have agreed.
The spirits...
The spirits have agreed
that the rain will come!
My God.
It will rain!
It will rain!
The spirits have agreed.
It will rain.
Is that it?
Yes, it will rain.
Everything's fine.
Brisky Japan, I just
came from Lusaka.
My friend take it easy
this is my last supper.
If you give trouble I will
write you using a marker.
The rap is colour purple,
listen to this girl.
Have you ever heard a
girl who raps like this.
Mic check one, two,
three to the four.
My flow is a race, on
your marks let's go.
You're using her.
You are using her.
He is asking...
How do you feel being a witch?
- How are you?
- Fine.
- What's your name?
- I'm Shula.
Why are you upset?
Who put you in here?
They're not here.
Have you been here long?
Yesterday.
Do you know why you're here?
Want to take a picture with her?
Shula, look here.
Look.
Look!
Shula! Shula!
No.
No.
Hey!
Now look at what's happened,
she's locked us out.
How do you leave keys in there?
Come and try to open...
Try to open with something here.
Come on, lift me up.
Why didn't you open the door?
Sit up! Why didn't
you open the door?
I'm asking you why you
didn't open the door.
I'll toss you back
to where you belong.
I look after you and now you're
misbehaving... You witch!
Sit properly!
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me!
Don't look at me,
look somewhere else!
Do you see that big tree?
That's where I want you to go.
Understand? Start moving.
- What is your name?
- I'm Shula.
Welcome, servant
of the Government.
Thank you.
How is your father?
He's fine.
Is that true?
Yes, ma'am.
When was the last
time you saw him?
About a week ago,
I spoke to him on the phone.
- What about your mother?
- She's fine, too.
I hope your wife is fine too.
Yes, ma'am.
I've heard rumours
that we have a witch
who has the power to bring rain.
Yes, ma'am.
People in this kingdom
are struggling.
They're complaining because
they started planting,
but their crops are dying in the field.
Where is the rain?
I heard that it's that little
girl you sent to school.
According to the laws
of the Government...
- The Government?
- Yes.
Tell me, where was the Government
when I brought the witches here?
And where was the Government
when I was feeding them?
Where was the Government?
Are these the plans of the Government,
that they should come here,
saying, "We'll buy you buses,
we'll buy you uniforms,"
so they can get 50%?
This is my kingdom.
The Government has
no right at all.
The Government requires
that all children...
We do not send
witches to school.
Go back and tell the
Government that I'm angry.
And don't take anything
out or add anything!
Unedited version!
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.
He's becoming stupid.
If you are a witch,
bring us rain.
We want rain here.
Hurry up.
Sorry.
Shula!
Why are you upset child?
Tell us.
If you are upset you
have to say so.
Shula, what's upset you? Why
are you being so stubborn?
So what is bothering you Shula?
I was just thinking I should
have chosen to be a goat.
A goat is better. It can move about
freely and eat when it wants.
I should have chosen
to become one.
No Shula stop it.
That's what you've been
thinking in that head of yours?
You can't become a goat!
They will kill you and
eat you for supper.
Come all Let's sing for Shula.
Come all Let's sing for her.
Come people Let's
sing for Shula.
Come all Let's sing for her.
Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.
This is the last celebration.
Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.
This is the last celebration.
There's a celebration for birth
There's a celebration for marriage.
But this is her
last celebration.
There's a celebration for birth
There's a celebration for marriage.
But this is her
last celebration.
Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.
This is the last celebration.
Come everyone, come all
Let's sing for Shula.
This is the last celebration...
