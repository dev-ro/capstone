Listen,
Business isn't great.
Whatever l earn isn't
enough to pay the workers
or the moneylenders l owe.
So please be generous with me!
Lord Vigneshwar!!
Team DrC
Dear John,
l've just opened the shop.
Don't come here
asking for money!
l already told you
what l had to say!
Vijayan,
you came to me asking for money.
And l have come here
for that money!
So shouldn't we have some
respect for each other?
Sit.
Sit down man!
l don't know if it's
because l'm rich.
All these guys respect me.
But luckily l have
respect only for money!
John,
You took almost double of the
original amount from me as interest.
l won't pay anymore!
This business is over!
So there's neither money
nor respect for me?
Bringing someone else's cash into
our own pocket is called business!
lt's an art, isn't it?
What's the point in
being furious about it?
You're trying to teach me business?
You son of a b##Ch!
Chase all these rascals away!
Let me see if l can
do business here!
Get out!!

Team DrC
Dad, just go check
what happened.
What?
Rent..
l haven't received it yet.
Hey,
it's not urgent.
You can give me later.
Anjali..
l saw her leaving
from here in tears.
Errr.. l was just saying..
My God!
What is this?
Scaring people?
You got scared, didn't you?
- l'm not scared!
Anyway you've decided to go..
So l thought l'll
drop you till there.
Oh!
So you came to drop me?
You needn't!
l know how to go there myself.
Can you slow down, please?
l can't even utter a word.
You lose your temper
at the drop of a hat!
- Leave him Matthukkutty,
he loses his temper easily.
ls it?
You lose your
temper easily, huh?
Let me see!
- What happened?
Didn't you hear me?
l asked you what happened?
l.. l fell down..
Tell me the truth.
Did someone hit you?
Gosh. What happened, son?
Stand up.
What happened?
That Mathukkutty hit me, mom.
Aren't you ashamed
to come here crying..
after being beaten up
by those wastrels?
Why are you shouting at him?
Go ask those kids who hit him.
Hey Krishnadas!
You should raise
your child well.
Come here.
Did you see his nose?
lt was smashed by your dear son!
lf this happens again, l
won't be reacting like this.
l'm telling you!
Come here!
You won't play here anymore.
Did you hear that?
Whom are you staring at?
Leave the cane!
Get out from here!
Don't enter my class ever again.
l called you so many times last night.
And your line was busy.
Where were you?
Leave me!
Siddhu, those guys hit me!
Aren't you ashamed to cry
after getting beaten up?
Hit them back!
- l...
Hit them!
Catch them!
Close the gates!
Move!
Team DrC
Where's Sunny?
Come here.
Hit him.
l said, hit him!
Finish them!!
You think you're a hero seeing
all these cheers and applause?
Hitting people in campus
is not so heroic!
lt's better to beat up people
than being beaten up, right?
l'm scared.
When you start reacting violently for
every damn thing, it really scares me.
We're in that volatile age, right?
lt will change gradually.
Keep in mind that you're
in your final year.
You should pass in your exams.
And then get ajob.
l don't think my dad
is going to agree.
For what?
To marry you!
Why?
You don't want to?
Do l?
l do, l do!
Team DrC
Move!
There she is.
All the best!
- l'll come in the evening.
What, man?
What happened?
My dear bro,
l sold that property for the
minimum rate l could get.
l didn't try to make any profit.
l don't think real estate business
would be worthwhile anymore.
Of course!
Why are you taking it?
Who are you to make
me wait like this?
Hey..
See..
He's here.
- We should teach him a lesson.
What happened?
l don't know!
Who's this?
Falling down just like that?
Get up.
Don't get people talking.
Take a decision regarding this.
And don't think you can
come home after that.
Who's this?
- Dad!
Give them the garlands.
Anjali!
You don't be tensed
about all that now.
Everything will be alright!
Shouldn't we sleep?
Anjali is waiting.
Team DrC
Are you married?
Yes!
You're new here?
l'm Prakashan.
Sidharth!
- See you around.
Hey.. Hey.. l'll...
l'll pay this time.
The bank deducts a fees.
lt's all gone with that.
You're saying the same thing again!
l want my money back.
There's only 900 left.
- l don't want to know all that.
l don't want anything else.
l just want my money back!!
1 minute.
Nothing, Sir.
How are you?
- Fine!
Anjali!
Nothing is in it's
place in this house!
Team DrC
Won't even respond!
- Started in the morning itself?.
How else will it be!
You pick up junk from all over
the place and bring it home!
What junk?
Where's the car key?
Why are you so furious forthat?
Can't you search calmly?
l wasn't furious.
l just asked where
the car key was.
Got late?
Me too..
Which one should l
fill to deposit cash?
- Bro, can you give me your pen?
Yellow!
Bro, pen. l'll give it right back!
Deposit this, son.
Don't deposit all of it
into this chequebook.
Deposit half on this book
and half on this ATM card.
All the money in your account can
be accessed by the ATM card.
l don't want that. People at home
will take all the money carelessly.
My daughter's son Basheer.
He is quite notorious.
And, can you make a system where you can
withdraw only 500 if you enter 1000?
There's no such system here.
- Then what kind
of a bank is this?
Let me see if l can find a
bank with such a system!
Wow! lt's working again!
See...
What is it, Prakashan?
l was just testing it.
lt's working.
Have you seen the other
end of this sheet?
Where is it?
- What the..
Take it and get lost!
What, man?
What is it, brother?
lt's not working..
Use this..
- Thanks brother.
Hey sir..
Account number has only 8 digits.
But to fill it, there
are 14 columns.
Even if l write from left

5 columns are still empty.
What should l do?
You just write your account
number there, Sir.
Oh! That's all?
Ok fine! l shall.
'Please do not use
mobile phones here.'

l'll call you back.
Bloody hell..
Sorry Sir. l have a lot of work.
Even l have a lot of work!

You can go there.
