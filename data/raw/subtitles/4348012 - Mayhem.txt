Derek: Say hello
to Idiosa Dartellum 7,
or the ID-7 virus.
Nasty-looking
little fucker, huh?
For the uninitiated,
the ID-7 strain makes
stress hormone levels rise,
blocks neural paths,
essentially attacking our id
and throwing off
a very important balance
in our brains...
the balance between
emotions and reason
that keep us
from doing stupid shit,
thinks like punching
your boss in the face when angry
or fucking your date
in public when horny.
That balance
is temporarily severed,
causing inhibitions to drop
and basic instincts
to rise to the surface
as the infected fall victim
to what experts call
emotional hijacking.
Social media has tagged it
the red-eye virus
for obvious reasons.
♪♪
So in a nutshell,
basic human dignity
takes a sick leave.
The first reported case
of the red-eye virus
occurred 18 months ago
in Des Moines, Iowa,
and quickly spread
around the world.
Since then, there have been
over 1,000 confirmed outbreaks
reported globally,
over half of which
are in the United States alone.
The CDC is optimistic they can
contain the virus immediately
through mandated quarantines,
and the nation
will be virus-free
by the end of the year
as antibodies are being
aggressively tested.
They also state the virus
isn't lethal,
which is technically true.
But while the virus can't kill,
the infected, or redders, can.

Derek:
His legal defense alleged
that those infected
with the ID-7 strain
can't control their emotions
and therefore are not liable
for the resulting actions.
And thanks to a loophole,
the case was dismissed.
So Nevil lost his shit,
stabbed a co-worker repeatedly
in the face till dead
and walked
thanks a doctor's note.

Now, you all know

By all accounts, Mr. Reed
was an upstanding pillar
of the community,
earned two master's degrees
by the age of 21.
He married his
college sweetheart
and is the father
of beautiful twin girls.
But when Mr. Reed contracted
the ID-7 virus, shit got real.
"Overwhelmed by pure id,
Nevil Reed became prone
to involuntary,
aberrant, and shocking impulses.
He commited a gruesome,
unspeakable act
in broad daylight
in a room full of witnesses."
Now, we're witnessing
a model citizen here
transformed into a brutal,
bloodthirsty killing machine
at the blink of an infected eye.

What's that?
The terms of my surrender,
partnership contract.

You're a fucking piece of shit.
Look, my guy killed your guy.
You killed my guy,

Let's just get down
to business now, huh?
Ladies.
Monthly profit participation,
annual performance bonus,
vehicle allowances,
gas, maintenance,
insurance, chauffeur.
Expense accounts,
full cellphone allowances,
paid parking, country-club fees.
I've seen you admiring
all of this, Derek.
Isn't this what
you've always wanted?
Yes.
Then why don't I see
a fucking pen in your hand?
Do you really want to spend
the next 20 years of your life
just working
your ass off for what,
maybe half of what
I just offered you?
Sign it, Derek.
Sign it,
and I'll suck your cock.
Sign it, and I'll help.

Derek:
And so the king falls.
With the quarantine
about to lift,
I finally got to plead
my case to The Nine...
excuse me, Eight...
and have my own day in court.
Surprisingly, given the fact
that I just threw their former
CEO off a balcony,
they seemed pretty
willing to listen.
In a calm and collected manner,
I explained to them
my situation,
my dedication to the firm,
the abuse of company resources
by those above my pay grade,
yada yada.
I don't need to bore you
with the long-form version.
With a sound defense and
in light of the day's events,
I pled that...
I think I deserve my job back.
But as they voted,
it dawned on me,
something my sister had been
trying to tell me for years,
what my new friend
reminded me today.
I didn't have a job.
The job had me.
I was just another
fucking slave to the grind.
Look, we paint our paths
with the best of intentions,

Oh, and the incident at TSC,
as they're calling it,
ended up being a watershed case
to finally accelerate a vaccine
to prevent the symptoms
of the ID-7 virus,
pending FDA approval, of course.
You're welcome.
And for the firm itself,
well, they did what
any corporate asshole
in a corner would do.
They offered me Towers' job.
Finally a seat

We wrapped this story up
in a nice little bow,

killed a bunch of people.
I live with that.

happens for a reason.
I'm starting to believe it.
Here's one more pro tip.
