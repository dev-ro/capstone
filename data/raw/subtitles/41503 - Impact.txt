[MUSIC PLAYING]
Impact, the force with which
two lives come together.
Sometimes for good,
sometimes for evil.
[GAVEL KNOCKING]
[INTERPOSING]
But we have our
stockholders to answer to...
Phone Mrs. Williams,
[INAUDIBLE].
Tell her to be ready in about
an hour and I'll pick her up.
Yes, Mr. Williams.
You phone Sam and and see if
those papers on their way over
from the executive.
Yes, Will.
[GAVEL KNOCKING]
Well, Mr. Mr. Darcy, what's
the score, nine to nothing?
I'm afraid it is, Walt.
If you think you can persuade
them to change their minds
go right ahead.
Gentlemen, I never interfere
in stock issues, dividends,
or anything else
in your department.
I must run my department
with no interference.
Either I know why and when
I need more factory space
or you need another boy.
And that's all
right with me too.
Because I can take
these plans and pick
my own spot motor
production field.
You won't have to worry
so much about dividends,
there won't be many.
[ARGUING]
I'm sure none of us want to
lose Walt or our dividends.
What do you say we
take another vote?
All in favor of buying
the three new factories
signify by saying aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
Aye.
A unanimous vote.
Congratulations, Walt.
Congratulate the board,
they're the winners.
Williams, if these
factors are so
valuable that other companies
would jump at the chance
to get them, how do
you know that you
can buy them at the
price you quoted us?
How do I know?
I bought them this morning.
[ARGUING]
Della, I was asked to rush
this up for Mr. Williams.
Did you my wife, Della?
Your maid said she's
gone to the dentist.
I gave her the message.
Oh, fine.
Oh, this just came.
Thank you.
What about those papers?
They're here.
Burke's checking them now.
Good.
Congratulations, Walt.
Take a look at clause
four, those provisions
haven't been clarified yet.
Oh no?
I wanted to leave
for Tahoe right away.
Get Judge Derring on
the phone, will ya?
Nevermind.
I can get faster action if I
run out to San Rafael myself
and stick with him
until they're right.
[BUZZ]
Yeah?
Mrs. Williams on three.
Oh, put the blueprints of
that new diesel in, will ya?
I want Jackson to see them.
Hi, duchess.
I'm afraid now we won't be able
to leave til about 5 o'clock.
What?
You're not going with me?
But I counted on it.
But I thought as soon
as Dr. Harris took care
of whatever it was,
I'd feel better.
I don't.
Stupid thing still aches.
And I certainly
wouldn't be a very
desirable driving companion.
Now seriously
darling, you run along
and buy your little
factories and hurry home.
I'll send your
bag to the office.
And cheat me out
of my good bye kiss?
Not a chance.
I've got to drive over to San
Rafael, I'll stop on the way.
Love me?
Bye, dear.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[WHISTLE]
How do you expect me to
whistle through a toothache?
Nothing in in the
whole world smells
as sweet as you do, duchess.
I certainly don't feel sweet.
I'm as grouchy as an old bear.
Well, Doc Williams can give
you something to fix that.
Close your eyes.
Relax a minute.
Take a look at that and see
if you don't feel better.
Oh, Walt.
Oh darling, it's beautiful.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
You know, to quote my wife,
I like monograms on things,
it shows they belong
to me, unquote.
When did your wife say
such a thing Mr. Williams?
About six years ago
when I married her.
She gave me the first
monogrammed shirts
I ever owned.
Those were the
words on the card.
I still have it.
I certainly hope your
board of directors
never discovers what
a softy you are.
They won't.
Don't worry.
I have only one vulnerable spot.
What really happened
this morning?
All I got out of Della
was that you stalked out
of the office with
blood in your eye
and were back in no time with
canary feathers in your mouth.
Oh, I clipped
those bird's wings.
They're short.
No one's going to
vote me down, sweet.
Not when I know I'm right.
Mm-hmm.
But how did you convince the
board of that so quickly?
With subtle hints and
then easy persuasion.
Like this.
Either I get what I want or
you get yourself another boy.
And that's all
right with me too.
[CRASH]
Walter.
What a clumsy ox.
I'm sorry, duchess.
Oh please, sweet,
don't be so upset.
[LAUGHING]
If you could have
seen your face.
Oh, don't bother dear, Su
Lin will take care of that.
Not exactly a good
prescription for nerves, huh?
You know you're
wrong, Dr. Williams.
The way I feel
now, a good cat nap
will probably make a
new woman out of me.
If it's not going to
make you too late.
Yes?
I'm sure that by
5 o'clock I'll-
- Swell.
I'll run over to San Rafael
and get things ironed out
and be back for you
by 5:00 on the nose.
Darling, wait.
That's perfectly, silly.
I'll take a taxi cab and
meet you in Sausalito.
There's a drugstore on the
corner opposite the square.
I'll be there at 5:00 and we
can go straight on up to Tahoe.
That'll save you all that
late afternoon traffic and all
the time it will take
to come and pick me up.
Smart woman, my wife,
thinks of everything.
Where is your bag, honey?
Oh, Su Lin still has some
things to press for me.
You sure you don't
mind taking a taxi?
Very sure.
Sweet dreams, duchess.
See you at 5:00.
I'd better get going.
Bye, hon.
Long distance.
I want Berkeley seven,
nine, seven, two, one.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello.
Ah, hi ya, beautiful.
Yeah.
Here.
Don't forget, turn
this stuff over
to a bell boy at the
Airport Hotel in Oakland.
Tell him to hold
it for Jack Burns.
Jack Burns, the Airport Hotel.
That's right.
I'll be checking in later.
What do I owe you?
A $1.15 to here, all this
stuff back to Oakland...
Yeah, yeah here.
Buy yourself a
new pair of pants.
Fine.
Hey, where's that new woman
who was going to meet me?
It's after 5 o'clock.
Oh, gee, I was so sure
you were going to be OK.
Maybe you'd better get
yourself another dentist, huh?
Of course, I understand,
honey, of course.
Just to prove it to you,
I'm coming right on home.
No, you really
mustn't, darling.
I'm going to be perfectly
all right really.
And besides...
Besides what?
Well, I've done something
you're not going to like.
You remember Aunt
Margaret back in Illinois?
You mean the old
gal in Evanston?
I'm way ahead of you.
How much?
Well, It isn't money this time.
It's another relative, her
favorite nephew Jim Torrence.
All of a sudden out of the
blue just after you left,
he telephoned me from Berkeley.
OK duchess, I'll see
you when I get back.
Well you don't
understand, dear.
You're going to
see him right away.
I'm what?
Well, all he seemed
to want was to be
able to get back
to Illinois, so...
So you buy him a ticket.
That's easy.
Well, it isn't.
I offered to, but he
got huffy and said
he didn't want any handouts.
Well, without
thinking I told him
we'd pick him up and give
him a lift as far as Denver.
I won't say I'm getting
exactly an even trade for you.
But where do I find this guy?
Well, he should
be there right now.
I told him to be on the lookout
for a cream colored roadster,
just in case we
failed to recognize
one another after
all these years.
Oh darling, you're such a lamb.
Are you sure you forgive me?
What do you think?
Well, I better along.
Your cousin Jim
might get nervous.
Take it easy, sweet.
And miss me, will ya?
I do already.
Don't drive fast, and please
take care of yourself, softy.
Goodbye.
Hello, Della?
Yeah, Mrs. Williams
wasn't able to go with me.
Now, while I'm gone,
you see that she
gets her roses every morning.
That's right.
But this time on all the
cards put, love from Softy.
Yeah, S O F T Y. Hello.
You must be Jim Torrence.
Yeah, that's me.
I'm Walt Williams.
Hi, Jim.
Hi.
Where's Irene?
Oh, she's a little
under the weather
at the last minute, worst luck.
Ah, that's too bad.
I was hoping I'd see her.
Yeah, I'm disappointed too.
Where's your luggage?
Ah, I'm wearing it.
Less trouble that way.
Irene tells me you're
heading for Illinois.
Yeah.
Goings been a
little rough, huh?
I haven't exactly been
worried about my income tax.
What's your line, Jim?
Oh, I guess I'm a better
salesman than anything else.
Hmm.
You know, I can give you a
couple letters when you get
back to Chicago
that might help you.
That's fine.
A little in with the
top brass never hurts.
What outfit were you with?
Patton's Third Army.
How was it?
Rough.
Except for the time in Italy,
I kind of like it there.
Patton's outfit
never got to Italy.
Of course.
But most civilians
never know or care
and I figured you didn't either.
Well, I fooled you that time.
Our last chance to chow
for a while, how about it?
No, thanks.
I grabbed a hamburger while
I was waiting for you.
I can still taste the harness.
Are you sure you
won't change your mind?
Nah, I'm going to
grab a little shut eye.
Chicken sandwich and a Coke.
One chicken sandwich.
Chicken sandwich coming up.
Give me change for
a dollar, will you?
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
San Francisco, uh, Klondike
two, six, seven, one, four.
[PHONE RINGING]
Klondike two, six, seven,
one, four does not answer.
Oh, well, well, try Setter one,
two, five, nine, nine, please.
Bayview Apartments.
Oh yes, Mr. Williams.
No, your maid isn't
there tonight, sir.
She said Mrs. Williams
was taking something
to make her sleep and
wasn't to be disturbed.
But perhaps...
No, no, don't disturb her.
Just leave a
message that I won't
forget about a certain problem.
Mhm.
I think I have it, sir.
You want her to forget all
about a certain problem.
Softy, is that S O F T Y?
Softy is going to take
care of it thoroughly.
Is that all?
Yes, that's all.
She'll understand.
Be sure she gets it the
first thing in the morning.
Bye.
Oh, hi.
It's been so long since
I've been behind the wheel
of anything but a
Caterpillar or a Jeep,
I had to find out what
a real buggy feels like.
Why don't you
drive for a while?
That's swell.
Nothing would suite me better.
Tell me, uh, Irene still got
that little scar on her cheek?
The one she from the fall?
Yeah.
You can hardly
see it now though.
How did you know about that?
She just got it last summer.
I thought you said you
hadn't seen her for years.
Uh, uh, from Aunt
Margaret, of course.
How else?
She always sends me the
news in her letters.
I'm sure Aunt Margaret will
be pretty happy to see you.
Irene says you're
the favorite nephew.
I'm afraid my lovely
cousin was just
giving me a build
up for your benefit.
You don't know Irene.
Maybe not.
What's the matter?
I think we've got a flat.
Yeah, flat as a flounder.
Well, let's get to work.
I Hey, look out
there, young fellow.
It's quite a drop.
You got a flashlight?
I think I have.
Get the jack, I'll take a look.
Did you find it?
Yeah.
It won't be long now.
Come on, let's get going.
Uh, wait a minute.
Did one of your
cuff links fall off?
Huh?
Well, something dropped.
I, I saw it fall down
there at your feet.
Hm.
It must have rolled
under the car.
From Irene and me.
Hello.
Need a hand?
No, no, I'm all set now.
OK.
Goodnight.
Keys.
Need any help, bud?
That guy must be crazy.
[HORN HONKING]
Now, in case my husband
should be late and have
to rush for his plane,
this will be taken care of.
Thank you.
Show Mrs Burns to 302.
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Irene and me, sucker.
Irene and me, sucker.
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): Take
care of yourself, Softy, Softy.
[KEYS TYPING]
Young lady.
Excuse me.
I want to see Mrs.
Walter Williams.
I'm sorry, sir.
But she left orders
not to be disturbed.
I'm sorry too, Lt.
Quincy of the police department.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello.
I thought I left orders
not to be... Oh, I see.
Ask him to come up, please.
[DOOR BELL]
Yes?
I'm Lt.
Quincy with the
police department.
I'm study to disturb you at
this hour, but may I come in?
Of course.
Well, lieutenant?
Did your husband go on a
motor trip late this afternoon?
Why, yes, he went to
Denver on business.
Why?
Was he driving a
Packard Roadster?
Yes, is, is anything wrong?
I'm afraid there is.
Won't you sit down?
Has, has something
happened to my husband?
Yes, Mrs. Williams.
He's dead, isn't he?
Yes.
Oh, Walt, I knew something
like this would happen.
I begged him time and again
not to pick up hitchhikers.
It wasn't a hitchhiker,
Mrs. Williams.
It was just an accident.
He ran into a truck,
a gasoline truck.
You mean there was fire?
He must have been
driving pretty fast.
I don't think he felt
anything after the crash.
If there's nothing more you
need me for, lieutenant, I...
I think I understand.
And may I say you've taken this
with a great deal of courage.
Goodnight, Mrs. Williams.
FEMALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Take care of yourself, Softy.
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
Irene and me, sucker.
Ready?
Yeah.
That Williams must
have been quite a guy.
Yeah, he went to work
for Universal Motors
as a sheet metal worker.
Mhm.
In less than ten years he's
their top production man.
Well, he sure went out
in a blaze of glory.
Yeah.
All right, let's go.
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Softy.
MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER):
From Irene and me, sucker.
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Softy.
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Sucker.
FEMALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Softy.
MALE SPEAKER
(VOICEOVER): Sucker.
Could Mr. Burns have
taken a later plane
and still make connections
for Mexico City?
I see.
Thank you.
[KNOCK]
Yes?
There's some
telegrams for tar tar.
Just put them under
the door, Su Lin.
[KNOCK]
Please, tar tar, a policeman
Quincy most anxious to see you.
Ask him to wait, Su Lin.
Mrs. Williams will
see you presently.
You'll wait please.
[DOOR BELL]
Flowers for Mrs.
Walter Williams.
Thank you.
Roses, Mr. Williams always
sends when he is away.
You seem to have been
fond of Mr. Williams.
Su Lin is honored to have
served him five years.
And he...
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting, Lieutenant.
I wouldn't be disturbing you
again if it wasn't necessary.
And I won't be keeping
you but a moment.
You're being very considerate.
Won't you sit down?
Everyone's been most thoughtful.
And why shouldn't they be?
Forgive me.
I'm all right now.
What was it, Lieutenant?
The state police would like
to have some information.
They found some wavy skid
marks for quite a distance
on the road as if the car
had been out of control
when it crashed.
Tell me, was Mr. Williams
a reckless driver?
Why no, he was a fast driver,
but certainly not reckless.
Well, was he, was
he a heavy drinker?
Quite the contrary.
What about his health?
Could he have had a heart
attack and lost consciousness
before the accident?
I, no, he, he was
in perfect health.
But he'd been working
much too hard lately
and, and was overtired.
Perhaps he fell asleep
at the wheel last night.
Oh, poor darling.
If only I'd been able to
go with him last night
he might still be alive.
Well, maybe and maybe not.
You mustn't blame
yourself, Mrs. Williams.
Fate plays an important
part in these matters.
Your handkerchief.
When's the next train
to San Francisco?
10:00 a.m.
tomorrow.
Uh, you're sure there
isn't one sooner?
No, I'm sorry.
We have a circuit now, sir.
Evanston calling Mrs.
Margaret Hubbard's
residence in Evanston.
One moment please.
[PHONE RINGING]
Hello?
Mrs. Margaret Hubbard?
Yes.
Who's this?
Long distance.
I have a call from
Mr. James Torrence.
Who?
Mr. James Torrence.
He's a nephew, Jim Torrence.
The call is for your
nephew Jim Torrence.
I haven't any nephew, and I
don't know any Jim Torrence.
Sir, uh, Mrs. Hubbard
says she doesn't...
What's the matter, son?
Looks like you need a doctor.
A doctor?
I can't leave the
station, but old Doc.
Bender's just across
the road there.
Yeah.
Doctor.
Think you can make it?
Yeah.
I'll make it.
Now, take it easy, man.
There's some concussion there.
You've got to watch
your step for a while.
Yeah.
Walter Williams' beautiful
widow, who by her own request,
sat alone in the family
alcove during the service.
Smart, someone might have
caught her licking her chops.
Hey, what's that?
Walter Williams.
Walter, hey, ain't that the
guy that... For the love of Mike,
what is that
briefcase doing here?
He's dead.
They did him a dirty
tricky if he ain't.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't touch it.
We better turn it
over to the police.
[BUZZ]
Homicide, Captain Callahan.
Oh yes, Chief.
The Duke just came
in from Washington.
The fingerprints are
those of a James Torrence.
I'm putting Quincy on it.
Right.
That opens up a new can of
peas on the Williams accident.
There's the FBI
report on the guy.
Playing with ladies' affections
seems to come natural with him.
All you've got to do,
Quincy, is find him.
Yes, that's all I've got to do.
Last known whereabouts
of Jim Torrence
was in a moving van somewhere
between Sacramento and points
east.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Last known address care of his
sister, Mrs. Joseph Rosetti,
Irving Apartments, Berkeley.
Well, what are you
waiting for, Quincy?
Let's go.
Did Torrence leave any
forwarding address?
No, he said he was
going to send it to me.
Sorry to trouble you.
Oh, uh, Lieutenant.
If you should happen to hear
from him, will you let me know?
There's an unpaid telephone
bill and a bundle of laundry.
Laundry?
Let's have a look.
Maybe I'll have to take.
Not without a
receipt you don't.
You mean you don't
trust the police?
In my business you
don't trust anybody.
Mine too.
Holy St. Valentine's Day.
Look he had the same
thing on his shirts too.
Well, romance in your
late tenant's life.
Did you ever see the lady?
You know, I never did.
But I always knew
when she'd been
here, the wonderful perfume.
I'll lay you ten to
one she's a rich widow.
Could be.
But I'll get you
his telephone bill.
Pretty fancy stuff
for a hitchhiker.
Yeah, but he's a
pretty fancy hitchhiker.
According to the shirt maker,
a certain lady in the town
had these made special.
And they're just
like her husband's
only his initials were WW.
Sort of smells, don't it, Cal?
Now, take a look at
this little item.
It was also found
in the laundry.
I for Irene and W for... Well,
it could be for Williams too,
couldn't it?
[PHONE RINGING]
Yeah.
Homicide, Callahan speaking.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Fritz.
What news?
Uh-huh.
Any luck?
Both days, huh?
Swell.
Have it typed up and sign it.
This report from Fritz will
be a nice little topper
for this pile.
His check up shows calls
from Torrence's phone
to Williams' private number.
And a flock of them going
the other way including one
on the seventh and
several on the eighth.
The eighth in case
you've forgotten
is the date of Walt
Williams' accidental death.
That ought to be enough
to get an indictment out
of the grand jury.
Go pick her up.
I'd like to play
a long shot first.
It might give us two for one.
Well, take them one at a time.
A bird in the hand...
Is not going to
lead us to its mate.
I'd like to give the
lady a little more rope.
Well I...
Thanks, I thought you'd agree.
[DOOR BELL]
Well, Lieutenant, uh,
you just caught me.
I was...
I'm glad.
I have some rather
startling news
I thought you should know
before it hits the headlines.
Come in.
Thank you.
Sit down, won't
you, Lieutenant?
Thank you.
I'm very anxious to
hear about this news.
It seems that your first hunch,
remember, that a hitchhiker was
responsible for your husband's
death, well, Mrs. Williams,
you may have been right.
Why, I, I don't understand,
Your husband's briefcase
turned up in Kansas City
yesterday in a moving
van that had stopped
at the scene of the
accident that night.
Apparently the murderer
made his getaway in it.
That explains the
wavy skid marks
that made us suspect
your husband was
ill or unconscious at
the time of the crash.
Yes, I, I suppose it does.
And by now the man is
probably out of the country
and never will be found.
Don't you worry, Mrs. Williams.
There were fingerprints
on that briefcase.
And as soon as we get the
FBI report from Washington
his identity will be
known and this description
sent out on police broadcast.
Oh, we'll find him all right.
But just know we're keeping
things quiet so the murderer
will feel safe until we are
ready to close in on him.
Yes, I I can see
the wisdom of that.
Yes, I thought you would
understand and cooperate.
As soon as we know his
name, it is possible
that you might recognize it
as someone with a motive.
There's that possibility.
You know I'll do
everything I can to help.
Are you sure of it?
Now, I'll run along.
You'll hear from me.
I'll let myself out.
Don't bother.
And don't worry.
Good day.
[TYPING]
See, everything after the
letter J in the first name
has been obliterated by
heavy writing over it.
The only impressed
letters legible
are those between
words or before them,
like RNS at the end
of this name here.
And the Hotel Santa here
before the word Evanston.
Well, Tom, don't you think
it's about time you retire?
Why there isn't even evidence
there of Mrs. Williams
intent to communicate
with Torrence.
And who do you think she beat
a path to the telegraph office
to wire to, the
League of Decency?
I'll tell you what I think.
That you should have brought
her in when I first told you to.
By the time you
get her now, she'll
have figured out a way
to tip Torrence off.
He'll be that much
tougher to find.
Not unless she's tipped
him off from your office.
Ernie's got her on
ice waiting for you.
Pretty good, huh?
Fastest growing
little town in Idaho.
Have a heart, son.
Are you trying to
wreck that engine?
Oh.
Sure, it's a hobby of mine.
The way you're going
at it you can't miss.
Here, I just can't let you
ruin that beautiful motor.
Back her up.
OK, start her up.
Shut it off.
You're certainly not a mechanic
by trade with hands like that.
Maybe it's a hobby of mine.
Gee, what happened
to your head?
Perhaps I was talking when
I should have been listening.
OK?
OK by me.
Thanks a lot, Harold.
So long, Marsha.
Bye.
She's all right now.
You better lay it off
until the boss gets back.
I'm the boss.
I guess the new cars are
a little bit over my head,
Now, with a jalopy
it's different.
Aren't there any mechanics
around here you can hire?
No, they all went over to
the new factory in Mannsville.
I guess they got better wages.
Tough break.
How much do I owe you?
Oh, forget it.
But I'll be shoving along.
Well, at least have
a Coke on the house.
You might as well.
Marsha, can I use your
phone a minute please?
- Sure, help yourself, Uncle Ben.
- It never rains but it pours.
650 please.
Flat tire this morning
and now the danged engine
stalled on me.
Nice and cold.
Woodson's Garage.
No, I did not give
you the wrong number.
Fine thing using my phone to
cheat me out of a repair bill.
Aren't you ashamed?
Gave me the wrong number.
650 please.
You're a nice
girl, Marsha Peters
and your Ma's a fine woman.
And I'll always buy
my gas and oil here.
But you ain't never going
to tinker with my car again.
Busy?
Busy, always busy.
Wait a minute.
We're not so busy.
Would you like to
do another good deed
and give Uncle Ben a hand?
Why not?
Where is your car, mister?
Maybe I can help you.
Why, are you a good mechanic?
Very good and very reasonable.
Well, just what you need, girl.
Better hire him.
It's an idea, Uncle Ben.
Come on.
Thanks for the Coke.
Sure.
Well, I got Uncle Ben
fixed up all right.
Nothing but a sticky
carburetor valve.
Goodbye.
Well, I hope he paid you.
What for?
It only took a minute.
You're certainly not
money conscious stranger.
Here.
This is no kind of
work for a girl.
Somebody has to do it if
I want to stay in business.
And I want to.
Most be some business that
you're better suited for.
Can you lease this
place to somebody?
Sure.
I did while my
husband was overseas.
But when he was
killed in Okinawa,
well, we made a lot of
plans for the future here.
And I had a hunch
he'd like it if I
took over and tried
to make a go of it.
Takes more than a
hunch to do that.
I got along famously.
Business has been fine until
lately when the help got short.
Could be again if I
had a good mechanic.
Yeah.
You sure need one all right.
Oh, for Pete's
sake say yes or no.
Do you want the
job or don't you?
You mean you'd hire me without
knowing anything about me?
You can repair automobiles,
what else do I need to know?
Except your name, well?
Why not?
Sure, I'll try it
for a while until you
get someone permanent.
The name's Bill Walker.
OK, Bill, it's a deal.
And maybe if business gets
real good you'll want to stay.
Don't count on it.
Where's this go on the rack?
Yeah.
Marsha, Marsha, it happened.
It's a boy, eight
and a half pounds.
A pair of shoulders
like a prize fighter.
Well, congratulations, papa.
How's Jane?
Ah, perfect.
Everything's perfect.
I've got to get down to the
store and tell the gang.
I almost forgot.
Oh, gee, thanks.
I'm sorry I won't have
enough for the gang.
Yippee!
Maybe you can use this
token from a slightly
delirious new father.
Thanks.
Say, we haven't settled
the matter of wages yet.
Maybe I can't pay
your regular salary.
Suppose we leave that
open until you find out
how much I'm worth
to the business.
Doesn't seem to be any
business right now.
Might be a good time for
me to get rid of this beard
and find a place to board.
We live right next door.
I'll go ask Mom.
She'll know of a place.
Sort of a peaceful house.
I noticed it this morning.
Oh, gosh I forgot.
She's down helping Mrs.
Wellsley with her canning.
Mom finds homes for
everything from stray cats...
To stray mechanics?
Well, you're not
a stray anymore.
I'll go phone.
Pearl, 674 please.
Hello, Ms. Wellsley.
May I speak to Mother.
Hi, Mom.
I've got some good news for you.
I hired a man for the station.
Yeah.
No, nobody we know.
He's from... He's
from out of town.
Needs a place to board, you
got a good one up your sleeve?
OK.
She says she has to meet you
first to come home for supper.
Huh?
And you like apple
or cherry pie?
Cherry.
Cherry it is, Mom.
See you later.
Now, I've got to
get rid of this.
Hey, where's the
nearest barbershop?
The one and only,
just up two blocks.
Tell Judd you're working for me.
When you get back we'll
close up and go home.
Thanks.
Oh, that's real nice.
You must have had a good
bringing up, young man.
Thank you for the young man.
We thank thee
Lord for thy bounty
and ask thy blessing
on this food
and our new friend
who shares it with us.
I hope you're good
and hungry, Mr. Walker.
Who wouldn't be?
Marsha eats like a sparrow
with all the hard work she does.
Can I have your plate, please?
Well, she can taking it
easy now and boss the help.
She never takes anything easy.
She has to put her whole
heart and soul into everything
she does.
Well, now that you're through
with me, Mom, how about Bill?
Have you thought of a
place for him to stay?
Well, why can't
he stay right here?
We have a spare
bedroom going to waste.
And I think you like my cooking.
Like it?
That's very kind
of you, Mrs. King.
But it seems an imposition.
Imposition nothing,
that's good business.
I can get back what I pay
you in board and room.
Oh, Marsha, what
a thing to say.
If you'd like to stay,
we'd like to have you.
Will you have some
more vegetables?
Mrs. King, you have a boarder.
May I have a biscuit please?
Excuse me.
OK, Ms. Gallis.
It's wonderful
the way tools seem
to come alive in your hands.
You seem to sort of
come alive too as
though you got real pleasure
out of working with them.
I do.
When you're doing
a job with them
you can't think
of anything else.
Bill, if something's
bother you,
why don't you get rid of it?
What would you
prescribe, doctor?
Amputation for the stupid
chip on your shoulder.
What you need is a ring job,
save yourself some money.
Gee, Bill, with the
baby and everything I
just can't afford it now.
Ah, we'll take care of that.
Hey, boss.
How's Ed's credit?
Good enough for a ring job?
Well, sure if I can hold
Junior as collateral.
Oh, not a chance fella.
Never mind I'll do
it on my own time.
Ah, thanks Bill.
Maybe we'll see
you tonight, huh?
Some shoulders, huh?
Yeah.
Some father, huh?
Bye Marsha.
Bye.
Nice kids.
Hey, was that clowning
about they're being hard up?
No, things have been
pretty tough for him
ever since he got
out of the service.
Fix the car for him and only
charge him for the labor, OK?
Then he gets it for free.
I'd already figured
on knocking that off.
Say, we could make it
an anniversary present.
Anniversary of what?
Junior's arrival and mine.
Three months ago today.
Time certainly flies.
That was a lucky day when
you came to MP Service.
Your work's been bringing
in a lot of business.
I'm glad of that.
Say, look boss, why
don't we three celebrate
tonight and go to the movies?
Ed said he and Jane were going.
Well, that lets Mom out,
she'll be babysitting.
I'd love to go, Bill.
I haven't been in ages.
Here's your opportunity.
Go to work.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
Extra, extra.
This is Sheila Graham
with the latest news
of the shocking
Williams' murder case.
While beautiful Irene Williams
is held for trial charged
with conspiring to
kill her late husband,
the police are searching
for James Torrence believed
to be the lover of Mrs.
Williams and her partner
in the horrible murder
of Walter Williams.
If I'm handling your case,
my dear Mrs. Williams,
I want one third of
everything you get.
You're out of your mind.
You don't realize what
I'll get as Walt's widow.
Perhaps you don't realize
the spot you're in.
Torrence's fingerprints
were found not only
on your husband's
briefcase but in a manner
of speaking on your
reputation as well.
There's a detective named
Quincy, a very smart cookie,
he isn't exactly for you.
Frankly, Mr.
Warner, I'm beginning
to wonder if my
attorney is for me.
Underestimating the
enemy's ammunition
would scarcely be wise.
Now, if we can get to trial
before Torrence is found,
he'll never get a conviction.
But...
But what?
If he shows up we
may have to fry him.
Oh no.
Let's not cross that
bridge until we have to.
But if it comes to a choice,
we're not going to burn,
are we?
Aren't you the
chatterbox this afternoon?
What about this afternoon?
Oh, sorry, boss, I guess
I was wool gathering.
You're only supposed to
do that in the spring.
Is there anything
you don't know?
Yes.
What's San Francisco
got that we haven't?
Better newspapers
for one thing.
Anyway, California's supposed
to be the land of opportunity.
I thought that by
now you liked it here.
I do very much.
It's a good town, nice
people, swell boss.
Thanks.
We like you too.
No fooling though,
you'd be surprised
how many people ask
questions about you.
What kind of questions?
Oh, where you came from,
do you have any family?
Do you like it here and
are you going to stay?
Al Knox asked me at
the movie last night
if you wanted to join the
volunteer fire department.
Just interested friendly things.
I suppose it is
natural for people
to wonder about a stranger
who moves into their community
like I did.
You know, I've been
thinking maybe it
wasn't such a good idea you
and I going to the movies
last night.
It's all right being seen in
the station and here with Mom,
but...
You get used to that
in a town this size.
They're always trying
to marry people off.
You just ignore it and after
a while they forget about it.
I'll go get cleaned.
You know, I hate
to tell you how many
years this Sunday takes me back.
Did you always fall
asleep during the service?
I wasn't asleep, Mrs. Peters.
I merely closed my
eyes to concentrate.
Oh, so that's what you call it.
I had to nudge you to
stop you from yawning.
Quiet, you're disturbing
my reminiscent mood.
It even smells the same.
It could be the same bees
buzzing in the same clover.
As they say, you can take a
boy out of the country but...
A rolling stone
gathers no moss.
It has to stop rolling
sometime, doesn't it, Bill?
Sometime maybe.
We grow a very becoming shade
of moss here in Larkspur.
Don't you think?
You grow a lot of
nice things here.
Any one in particular?
I'll have to skip the
answer to that one.
Someone tore it out of the book.
You're married
aren't you, Bill?
Yep.
That's right.
You must have
loved her very much
to be hurt so deeply,
to be so afraid
of someone, even yourself.
Maybe it's better that
way, then no one gets hurt.
Bitterness and
hatred hurt everyone.
Can't you see, Bill?
They're like a wall that
shuts out all the sunshine
from the garden and
lets everything wither.
Make room in your heart for
something else, can't you?
I guess this is
my day for sermons.
Sorry.
As Mom would say, you never rich
mining in a fella's business.
[SIREN]
Hey that's a fire.
Anybody home?
In here, Bill.
Mrs. Wellsley sent a
couple of jars of peaches
said you helped her can them.
Oh, thank you.
When I delivered
the doc's car he
insisted that I have
a bite with him.
Where's the boss?
She took a book back
to the library for me.
Oh.
What a day.
Hey, what's the idea?
Are you darning my socks?
Well I thought a drawer
full of holey ones
isn't doing you much good.
I found it when I put
fresh papers in your bureau
yesterday.
You have a heap of the
things that need mending,
haven't you son?
Does Marsha know?
Do you think I'd tell her?
This is your problem, Bill.
Because I found out about
it doesn't give me the right
to tell anyone else,
not even Marsha.
When you trust folks
you trust them.
And you give them a chance
to work out things the way
that seems right to them.
How can one little
woman be so big?
Don't forget, it's a
lot easier to be tolerant
and understanding at
50 than it is at 25.
I'm going next door for a
while, Grandma Thompson's ill.
Mom.
Bill, are you home?
Bill, are you in there?
Yeah.
Mom went next door, Marsha.
Hi.
Did you work awfully late?
Oh, about 6:00.
Anything wrong?
Come in.
I want to tell you something.
I'm checking out.
Has something happened?
No, I'm doing
what I should have
done a long time
ago moving along.
But why, Bill?
My name isn't even Bill.
There isn't any Bill Walker.
I'm Walter Williams, the
late Walter Williams.
Walter Williams?
I don't understand.
You may not even
after I've told you.
But at least you'll
know the whole story.
Sit down please.
Finally Larkspur and you.
From there on you know.
I'm glad you're going
back to make things right.
Going back?
Wild horses couldn't
drag me back.
What are you going
to do about your wife?
Nothing.
You're going to let her
go to trial for murder?
Oh no, Bill.
Why not?
She tried to kill me,
she and her cousin.
But they didn't.
Who said they didn't?
Let them try and prove it.
No matter what
your wife did, you
can't be tried for something
that didn't happen.
Oh Bill, can't you see?
You bet I can see.
She deserves everything
she's getting.
The sorry part of it is
they'll never convict her.
No, Bill, the sorry part
is you're not big enough
to take a hard jolt to
your pride and to your ego.
Sure, it hurts to be
tricked and cheated
by someone you love
and believed in.
But that doesn't
give you the right
to take justice
into your own hands
to trample on the hearts of
others and walk out on life.
A barren, frustrated
boyhood, a marriage
to a woman who accepted
my love yet despised me
so thoroughly she
resorted to murder.
I'll never think of our moments
together without nausea.
I feel stripped bare, degraded.
Because you've closed
your mind and heart
to everything else even me.
Oh Bill, please.
Don't destroy the one chance
we have for happiness.
We haven't got a chance.
Doing the right thing
never works out.
I know.
In this world, you
turn the other cheek
and you get hit
with a lug wrench.
Forgive me, boss.
Try and forgive me.
[BABY CRYING]

into your own hands,
trample on the hearts of
others and walk out on life.
But, Bill, please don't
destroy the one chance
we have for happiness.
Mrs. Peters was kind enough
to come along to substantiate
at least the Larkspur portion
of what I've told you.
Very thoughtful of
you, Mrs. Peters.
Mr. Williams, when you
read in the newspaper
that the hitchhiker
who attacked you
had been a close friend of
your wife for some time,
it must have been a
great shock to you.
I didn't come here to
discuss my emotional reactions.
Lieutenant.
If you need me for
anything further,
Captain, my office will
know where to reach me.
Let's go, Marsha.
Just a minute, Mr. Williams.
We'll need your signed
statement for the grand jury
we ask for your wife's release.
It won't take long to be typed.
[PHONE RINGING]
Yeah.
All right.
Come in.
Sit down.
Mrs. Williams, we
have news for you.
Really?
I can scarcely wait.
It seems it was Torrence who
was in the car when it crashed.
It's Jim, dead?
You did it.
You killed him.
No.
He tried to kill
me, thought he had.
And he ran into the truck.
It was an accident.
An accident?
You wait all these months
to tell this story.
You let me rot in
this filthy jail.
Wait a minute.
You let everybody
believe you're dead.
Pretty convenient, wasn't it?
A dead man can't be
tried for murder.
Mr. Williams, perhaps your
wife would understand better
if you would explain to
her about the amnesia.
Amnesia?
Oh don't tell me you
believe he had amnesia.
Where's he been
all this time just
wandering around in a daze?
He tells us he's been in
Larkspur, a little town
in Idaho, working as a
mechanic in a service
station run by Mrs. Peters here.
I understand perfectly.
Now that my chance
for happiness is dead,
I suppose you'll demand
the divorce I've begged you
to give me so that
I could marry Jim.
That's fantastic.
Yes, isn't it?
After you telling us that
the man you picked up
was a perfect stranger.
That's not true.
The time and place for meeting
Jim had all been arranged.
I must advise you
there's a law that a wife
can't testify
against her husband.
There's a law against murder
too, but that didn't stop him.
And nothing's going to
stop me until I'm through.
And nothing's going to
stop me until I'm through.
It's all right
with me, Captain.
It's all right
with me, Captain.
Go on talk your head off.
I, I, I was to have
gone with him to Denver.
He insisted on it,
although I was quite ill.
Several hours before we
were to leave he came home.
There was a violent scene.
He threatened to kill me
unless I agreed to give up Jim.
And I wish he had.
This is incredible.
Not one word that
she has said is true.
Then you have nothing
to worry about.
Mrs. Williams, was there a
witness to the threat you
mentioned?
No, unless the maid overhead.
She was in the apartment.
In fact, she picked up
the pieces of a vase
that he threw at me.
Where is she now?
I don't know.
She left me suddenly
after all this began.
Please could the questions wait?
I feel rather ill.
Will you have Mrs. Williams
ready for the grand jury 10
o'clock tomorrow morning.
That's all.
We're going to hold.
On what charge?
Suspicion of murder.
But he's not guilty
of any of these things.
Then it should be
easy for him to prove.
Take him down and book him.
That fiction of Mrs. Williams
must have been very convincing.
No, we just couldn't buy that
yawn you tried to sell us.
Let's go.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]
And Daly's going to.
OK, boys, hop to it.
I want all I can
get by 10:00 a.m.
tomorrow for the grand jury.
OK, Chief.
Oh, Tom, don't miss a bit.
Dig up everything you can on
Williams and the Peters dame.
You surely believed Irene
William's story didn't you,
Call?
She made better
sense than he did.
Well, sure, she's a
better liar than he is.
Don't forget I went all
through her grieving
widowhood with her.
She's a bad customer.
Well, that's for the
grand jury to decide.
And Williams insisted
on letting her talk.
So it is his funeral.
Funeral all right, especially
with that yawn he told.
But murder is out of
character for him.
There's a few pieces
missing somewhere.
They might be in Idaho.
If it's not too much out of
character for you to get going.
You're going to miss me,
Cal, when I retire next year.
Maybe I'll turn private eye
and solve your cases for you.
Hi, Williams.
Mr. Williams.
Thanks.
Sort of feeling it from
the bottom here don't you?
Sorry Williams.
OK Williams.
Well, not very good news
judging from your faces.
Well, Walt, the
grand jury returned
an indictment against you.
Mrs. Williams was released.
I see.
Now, don't you worry, Walt.
We'll have you back at
work where you're needed
and in short order.
Come on, Eldredge
there's a visitor
waiting for him more
attractive than we old fogeys.
We're just leaving Mrs. Peters.
But remember, don't hesitate
to call on me for anything.
Thank you so much.
Hi, boss.
Bill, what have I done to you?
If it weren't for me
you wouldn't be here.
If it weren't for
you, I wouldn't be.
I came back here because I
wanted to believe in the things
you do.
I still do, no
matter what happens.
Will you do something for me?
Mhm.
Go back home.
So I know you'll
be taken care of.
Not a chance.
You'll have to think
of a better reason
than that to get rid of me.
I'm a big girl now.
I've just been to
Larkspur, Williams.
Where I found these
newspaper clippings.
Of course, some of them
are three months old
but you seem to treasure
them so I brought them along.
So?
I don't think they
exactly substantiate
your claim of amnesia.
As if you were interested
in substantiating any
claim of mine.
Now let's get one
thing straight.
Most people when
they get in a jam
think the police are only
interested in the prosecution.
Our job is to get
the facts, the truth.
And the truth never hurt
anyone but the fella that lied.
All I seen was a
beautiful woman.
Ah, quit kidding
yourself, Williams.
You made the bone up.
I had no more to do with
Torrence's death than you did.
And out of the whole population
of northern California
you just happened to
pick up a hitchhiker who
happened to be your
wife's boyfriend.
Ah, have a heart will you?
I suppose you'll tell the
truth when you take the stand.
But you better have some
mighty conclusive proof
if you expect the
jury to believe it.
Wait, Lieutenant.
Bill, we all know
you're not guilty.
But we're going to need help
to prove it and need it badly.
Lt.
Quincy can't take sides,
but if we're right
he has to be on ours.
And I have a hunch
he wants to be.
Why don't you tell
him the whole story?
All of it, please.
I'd like to.
Thank you very much.
I guess I should have told the
whole truth in the first place.
But I wanted to be
clean this mess up
with as little
scandal as possible.
Well?
No sign of the lug
wrench or anything.
My dear Mrs. Peters,
will you please
stop trying to be a detective?
How many times do you think
the police have combed
this spot for any
kind of evidence?
Now be a nice girl, take
Mr. Williams' advice.
Go back to Larkspur.
What time is it?
It's only 4 o'clock.
We still have time
to go back to town
and go on a hunt for Su Lin.
Now, look here, young woman.
You've had me on the
run since early morn.
But Lieutenant, the maid
seems to be our only hope now.
We've got to keep looking
until we find her that's all.
That's all?
Wait, she was
naturalized wasn't she?
Shuffling chopsticks.
Quincy you dumb flat foot.
This Su, what's her name?
Was Chinese born.
If her port of entry
was San Francisco
there'd still be a file
on her photo and all.
Let's go.
Back to town, immigration.
I hope the counselor has
given us the right lead.
Are you Ah Sing?
Understand?
You speak the English?
Also French,
Italian, and Hebrew.
May Ah ask what is desired?
We're looking for Su Lin Chung.
A Chinese counselor
said you were her uncle
and might tell us where she is.
This daughter of
my brother has she
offended the honorable police?
Oh no.
They just wanted to ask her
some questions about Mr.
Williams, the man
she used to work for.
Ah Sing's heart is heavy that
he cannot lead you to her.
But things that are not
known cannot be told.
Well if you hear anything of
her report it to headquarters.
Su Lin, untruth is
not good for soul.
And not wisdom when
told to policeman.
Better for the soul to
be kind than to be wise.
Su Lin must keep silent
to help in this matter.
You know, you're quite a gal.
In case I haven't
told you lately.
You're just too easily
pleased that's all.
There must be a way out.
Why can't we find it?
Oh, buck up, boss.
Tomorrow's another day.
It's the day you go to trial.
Bill, I'm afraid.
And the state intends to prove
beyond any reasonable doubt
that the defendant,
Walter Williams,
did with malice of forethought
kill the deceased James.
Torrence who he knew
to be hie wife's lover.
And then with his
victim dead beside him
he drove he car into the
course of an oncoming truck,
jumping clear himself some
seconds prior to the crash.
And subsequent he
made his getaway
in the back of a
loaded furniture van.
And for three months as Bill
Walker he laughed at justice,
but it imprisoned
his unfaithful wife
for conspiracy in
his own murder.
But then he decided that
being dead cramped his style.
He thought he could eat
his cake and it too.
So he returned, most anxious
to explain his long absence
and to write the
dreadful mistake that
had imprisoned his
wife for three months.
Ladies and gentlemen
it was a cold
blooded premeditated murder.
It must be punished to the
fullest extent of the law.
Call the first witness please.
Captain Callahan,
did Walter Williams
tell you what suddenly cured
his amnesia after three months?
No, he did not.
But he did tell you the man that
struck the blow which caused
the amnesia was
a total stranger,
a hitchhiker he had picked up.
Yes.
And that he knew nothing
of this man's identity
or a relationship with his wife
until he suddenly recovered
from his amnesia and
heard or read the details.
That's what he said.
We should all
thank you, Captain.
Your witness counselor.
No questions.
No, I saw no signs of amnesia,
but definite concussion.
He was a bit evasive
in answering questions.
But not vague or unsure.
In your opinion, doctor,
could this head injury
have been caused by a fall?
Yes.
If the head had
struck on some object
such as a stone or a metal pipe.
That's all, thank you.
Your witness.
Dr. Bender, are you familiar
with the tool known as the lug
wrench for changing
automobile wheels?
I'm afraid I am sir.
I've had a regular epidemic
of flat tires lately.
Well then in your
opinion could this
head injury which
you treated had been
caused by a blow
from a lug wrench?
Yes.
It could have been
caused by that too.
Thank you, doctor.
The ones with the earliest
dates you'll notice
are heavily creased
as though they've
been carried in a
wallet or a coat pocket.
Thank you.
Lt.
Quincy, will you
kindly tell the court
where you found these
newspaper clippings.
In the bedroom occupied
by Mr. Williams in Mrs.
Peters' home in Larkspur, Idaho.
Is this your
handwriting Miss Revere?
Yes, sir and
that's the message,
at least a record carbon of it.
Would you read it
to the court please?

Message for Mrs. Walter Williams
Penthouse D. Mr. Williams
called, said he
wants you to forget
all about a certain
problem that Softy's
going to take care
of it thoroughly.
Was there any
other conversation?
Well, I just asked
if that was all,
and he said yes,
she'll understand.
And sort of laughed as if
it were a joke and hung up.
Some joke killing
the wife's boyfriend.
[LAUGHTER]
The state versus
Walter Williams.
All the rounds so far have
gone to the prosecution.
And it was a grim faced Williams
who was returned to his cell
this afternoon.
What the score will
be after he takes
the stand is anybody's guess.
But he's going to need
some lucky punches
to get a decision.
And though Torrence
struck with intent to kill,
after telling you, this is
from Irene and me, sucker,
you still telephoned
Illinois to find
out if there was a cousin Jim.
You are hard to convince
aren't you, Mr. Williams?
Is it so incredible
that a man should fight
against believing such
a thing about his wife?
Oh, that is very touching.
I'm a husband who planned a trip
on which he intended to destroy
his wife and did kill her lover.
That's a lie.
Your honor, I object
to the conclusions drawn
by the prosecutor
and move that it
be stricken from the records.
But your honor, there is
a corpus delicti, remember?
Was your wife's lover.
Objection sustained.
There's also her own story
which in front of witnesses
you insist that she tell.
And then we have your
own two different stories
from your own lips.
One featuring a perfectly
strange hitchhiker, the second
an equally strange cousin
Jim without a question
of substantiation
for either of them.
Of substantiation
for either of them.
Su Lin!
Su Lin!
Follow that Yellow cab.
Please hurry.
Wait for me.
Su Lin!
Su Lin.
Ah Sing.
You remember me, don't you?
I was here with Lt Quincy
from the police department.
I just followed Su
Lin up the stairs.
I saw her come in here.
You must be mistaken.
I'm not mistaken, she's here.
I must see her.
Ah Sing, don't you understand?
It's to save a man from
prison, even from death.
I will send her to you.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
Oh, Su Lin.
We've been looking for
you all these weeks.
Mr. Williams need your
help so desperately.
I can not help.
You must forget that
you found Su Lin.
Forget it?
But you're his only witness.
You're the only
one that can help.
Not as a witness.
Only with silence can I
repay his great kindness
to me and my family in China.
Why?
I heard other things.
That most unhappy day
from Mrs. Williams
bedroom his voice
very loud and angry.
A flower vase broke into pieces.
He can explain all that.
I do not believe what
he's already told.
That I heard anything
would do harm.
Don't you see?
Yes.
Much sorrow comes from women
who no not honor the truth.
And Mrs. Williams she's not
true even to that Torrence man.
What made you say that?
That night when he was
killed, her sickness
was but wall of falsehood.
Behind which you could go
secretly to a meeting place.
You mean she went
out that night?
Su Lin are you sure?
Yes.
Because next morning
in her bedroom
I found street shoes that
had been worn, her coat
on the closet floor, with
the sleeves turned inside
out as though removed hurriedly.
And in one pocket a
door key to some hotel.
Su Lin, that's it.
Proof that she and
Torrence had planned
to meet that night after
he killed Mr. Williams.
What hotel was it?
Oh, I don't remember.
The key, what
did you do with it.
Returned to coat pocket.
Come on.
We'll get to Lt.
Quincy, he'll know what to do.
And pray Su Lin every
step of the way.
Now, hold everything.
Even if this long
shot don't work out,
we'll just keep on pitching.
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
Here it is, yes.
Room 302, Airport
Hotel, Oakland.
Maybe we got our miracle.
Especially the Chinese one.
It is the hope that Su Lin was
a small help to Mr. Williams.
Oh, Su Lin.
Come on, next stop Oakland.
Let's see the little
lady's hotel rendezvous.
I was on night duty.
But I sure don't remember
a looker like this.
Quite a dish, eh?
A little too highly seasoned
for my digestion, thanks.
Lieutenant, I just found a
couple of cards from room 302
on June 9th.
Judge Baxter
checked out at noon.
Mr. and Mrs. J. Burns
room not slept in.
J. Burns, Burns.
Look Quincy.
The handwriting on the
card is identical to that
on the photograph.
And here's a little
more of the same thing,
the cover up telegram
to Aunt Margaret.
And look at the impressions.
J here and here RNS.
J Burns.
That's the name she
started a telegram to.
Room not slept in.
Say, I got that dame
pegged now, Lieutenant.
She said they'd
be out of the room
by midnight, because her
husband was catching a plane.
But Quincy.
This ties it all up, doesn't it?
Yeah, like a greased pig.
What do you mean?
We've got the evidence
now, the proof.
Of what?
Su Lin's theory that Irene
was playing the field?
This evidence only
proves that she came here
to keep a date with
a man named Burns.
We can't even prove that
he didn't keep the date.
But you know he didn't.
There wasn't any Burns.
It was only a name that
she and Torrence used.
Fine.
If you can prove that
Williams will be free.
But none of this will prove it.
Sorry, copper.
But we are just up
another blind alley.
Right There's a couple sample
cases for Mr. Sam Anders.
Came up from the
station this morning.
Take them to Parlor
B right away.
Sure thing, sir.
Be seated.
The case of the state
versus Walter Williams.
Proceed, Mr. Eldredge.
Your honor, we will
call Mrs. Irene Williams.
Take the stand Mrs. Williams.
Raise your right hand.
Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you're about to give
has cause to be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?
I do.
What cooks?
The defense calling her?
Mr. Eldredge,
what's the purpose
in calling this witness?
Merely for purposes of
identifying handwriting.
Now, Mrs. Williams this
photograph of you...
Was stolen from my apartment.
So according to
the inscription,
to Walt, my adoring and
adored husband, Irene,
this belongs to Mr. Williams.
This is your
handwriting isn't it?
Of course.
I'm touched that he should
have wanted it so badly.
And this telegram addressed
to Mrs. Margaret Hubbard,
is that also your handwriting?
It is.
Now, Mrs. Burns, I
mean Mrs. Williams.
This photograph is
inscribed to Jim my adoring
and adored, Irene.
Did you write this too?
I, I see no point in all this.
Merely answer
counsel's questions.
Did you write it?
I did.
And these letters addressed
to Mr. James Torrence,
did you write them?
Yes.
And this monogrammed garment a
gift from you to Mr. Torrence?
Why must I be tortured
again by all this?
I never made any secret of
my love for Jim Torrence.
That's why he's dead.
Your love for Jim Torrence?
Yet on the very
night he was killed
you had a rendezvous with a
man named Burns didn't you?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
I don't know any
man named Burns.
I was at home that
night very ill.
Oh yes, the sleeping pills.
Well, you must walk
in your sleep then.
For you spent at least
part of that night
at the Airport Hotel in Oakland.
Where you registered for
Mr. And Mrs. J. Burns.
Don't waste the court's
time trying to deny it.
This is the registration card
that you signed at 9:20 p.m.
And there's the room clerk
who assigned you to room 302.
And this, Mr.s Williams, is the
key to room 302, which you very
carelessly left in the
pocket of a coat which
was found in your
closet yesterday.
All right, I was there.
Are you satisfied?
Not quite.
This J. Burns, Mrs. Williams,
was his first name Jack?
Yes.
Have you been in
contact with him lately?
No, no.
How long seen you've seen or
heard from this Jack Burns?
Well, I don't know,
I don't remember.
You bet, she doesn't remember.
Because there isn't any Jack
Burns and there never was.
That was an alias
for Jim Torrence.
And it was Torrence
who was to have met you
that night after your
charming little plot
to kill your husband
had been duly executed.
Not true, it's not true.
I have bad news, Mrs. Williams.
I can prove it's true.
These pajamas, these letters,
this picture, all of which
you identified for the court
were found in this suitcase
which is full of the clothes
and personal belongings
of Mr. James Torrence.
And the suitcase was found in
the baggage room of the Airport.
Hotel where it's been
held since June 9.
And it says on his tag in large
print hold for Jack Burns.
That is all, Mrs. Williams.
Just a moment, Mrs. Williams.
Your honor in view
of the evidence
presented, we now ask for a
dismissal of the state's case
against Walter Williams.
And we intend to charge Irene
Williams with conspiracy
to commit murder against
her husband Walter Williams.
Oh no.
The case against Walter
Williams dismissed.
Court adjourned until 2:00.
Well, that's that, Walt.
Congratulations, Mr. Williams.
I haven't the words
for it, Quincy.
But we, we could never
have made it without you.
Ah, sure you could.
You know, son, right always wins
if you give it a little push,
especially when
you've got a copper
like this one to do the push.
Well, I'll be seeing you.
You know, it will
seem kind of strange
to be able to eat and
sleep without someone
getting in your
hair all the time.
Oh, fine, Walt.
We're looking forward to having
your hand on the wheel again.
The Denver plants are
waiting for you to open them.
You think you could
make it in the morning?
How about it, counselor?
You bet you can.
Oh, good.
Well, I'll be running along.
Well, do you think
you'll like Denver?
It's OK by me, boss.
Yes, impact the force with which
two lives can come together,
sometimes for evil,
sometimes for good.
