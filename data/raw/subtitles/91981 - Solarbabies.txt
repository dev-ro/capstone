WARDEN: We live in the new time.
The year is 41, and the Protectorate
controls all the water on Earth,
and therefore, all life.
I am the Warden of Orphanage 43,
one of the many orphanages
that border the wasteland.
Children are brought here at an early age
to be indoctrinated to serve The System.
It hurts me to do what I do.
I, too, must serve The System.
Sometimes in my dreams,
I see the Earth as it was before,
green, with flowing
rivers and mighty oceans.
Can it ever be like that again?
There is a legend,
a tale told by the Tchiganis,
that speaks of a visitor
that came from the heavens.
The people called it Bodhi.
The legend says that it has come to
Earth to free the waters once again.
Is this legend true? Who knows?

- No, Strictor Grock.
And yet you allow

using homemade gear?
Strictor, if we just had...
Cut your breath before you

Without me, you're nothing,

You like it here.
It's quiet.
That's the difference between us.
I don't like quiet.
Yes, I know.
Why do you let them
go beyond the walls?
It's good for morale.
It lets them feel they're
getting away with something.
And after all, there is
no chance of escape.
The nearest uncontrolled
water is 100 miles away.
- I want them punished for it.
- All of them?
I saw only Solarbabies.
Were they winning?
(CHUCKLING)
Odd name for a skateball
team, don't you think?
"Solarbabies."
Soft. No menace.
Why do you suppose they chose it?
They don't seem to need anything
more menacing, do they?
They always seem to win.
But you needn't worry.
They'll be properly punished.
(MEN SCREAMING)

I would like to see Jason,

This orphanage is dedicated
to producing useful members
of the E-Protectorate.
I will not run it as a prison.
- Do you understand that?
- Yes.
Yes. Then why did I have a Strictor
from the E-Police Maiming Squad
in my office this morning?
- We were challenged by the Scorpions.
- WARDEN: I'm sure you were.
But you could have taken the
challenge here in organized play.
- They wanted the outside arena.
- WARDEN: Of course they did.
There are no rules at the arena.
Now understand something.
My power ends at the walls.
Outside, it's the Strictors' world.
There is nothing out there. Nothing.
Stick with us.
Learn to serve order and
you'll achieve a decent lifegrid.

Let them do 20 cubic meters.

Next time.
Well, little Stakker, they
gave us 20 cubes in the ditch.
Yes, there's times when it
pays to be just a mascot.
- Forget it. He's not wearing his ears.
- TUG: When's the next water privilege?
How long do I gotta wear this scuzz?
You're gonna have us holding our
noses for the next two days.
(CHUCKLES)
Unless we had a rainstorm.
Sure, well, how about a hurricane
or a flood while you're at it?
You believe all that dog
squeeze they feed us in class?
That's not the way it was.
Here's how it used to be.
"Thunder rolls distant
across the sky,
"in echo to pale
flashes of lightning.
"The vast cloudscape thickens.
"The scent of purest water
hangs in the air to be savored,
"before the first large
warm drops fall.
"Then, within seconds,
the air is no more,
"replaced by a vertical
curtain of falling rain.
"The land drinks and the
earth is refreshed."
Could you imagine to see clouds
and feel rain falling from the sky?
One of the few good things the
Protectorate ever did was outlaw fiction.
- Where'd you get this?
- Never mind! Just give it back!
Well, before you get so over-amped
over these pseudo-factoids, I'd...

No, it was.

He hears everything.
- No, you heard me. You can hear.

My electric ears don't even work.
I hear everything.

It's been thundering and lightning,
and we're all soaking wet!
I gotta believe anything's possible!
When did this happen?
Was it during the storm?
No. Bodhi did it when
I found him. Look.
He did it.
- Daniel, what is that?
- His name's Bodhi.
- I think he heard you.
- Of course he heard me.
He hears everything. Even when
I'm not talking, he hears me.
- Here. He likes to be held.
- It does.
I can feel it likes to be held.
- Hey, Bodie!
- DANIEL: His name is Bodhi.
Jason, can we keep him?
I mean, look, I fixed a bed
and everything. It'll be fine.
It doesn't need a bed.
I mean, it's not alive.
- We don't know that.
- METRON: Come on.
Bodhi feels just like we do.
And he's smart, too.
(ALARM BUZZES)
That was the second

All right.
Before we go, we all oath that no one
even breathes a whisper about this.
Daniel, I want you to pretend
that you're still deaf.
- Why?
- Because people will start probing,
and we gotta keep this thing
absolutely secret, okay?

I'm sorry.
I know that you understand things.
Maybe everything.
But who are you?
Where do you come from?
I know. It's a tough one.
See, I don't know where I come from.
And I don't know who I am, either.
But what's worse is,
I don't know where I'm going.
I don't know who I'm gonna be.
I just know that I can't accept
things the way they are.
I don't want to be part
of what I've seen.
But I guess I'll have to.

- TERRA: Yes, it is...

- We have a lot of work to do...
- What's going on?
- Is Bodhi okay?
Yeah. Yeah, he's fine.
I was just... holding him.
What's that?
- I just want to see if it's radioactive.
- Can't you just leave it alone?
Look, if we're around something
that's giving off radioactivity,
- we could all end up dead.
- Oh, please.
Just let him do it.
(BEEPS)
Nothing.
- Hi, Bodhi.
- Hey, Bodie, so you're not dangerous.
It's Bodhi.
Hey, look, he's speaking to you in your

- Yeah, but what is it?
- He's a who, not an it.
- Well, then who is it?
- I don't know. I can't figure it out.

Well, I just heard you admit there's

- Did you encourage him?
- No, I didn't.
- I wouldn't do that! You know I wouldn't.
- All right.
Get out of here. And we'll
meet in the clubroom.
- So we're gonna go after him?
- Be quiet.
He's a little boy all alone.
I say that we go.
Listen to me carefully. This is
not like sneaking off to the pits.
It's not gonna be 20 meters
in a ditch for this one.
If we do get caught, it's gonna
mean mainstream labor site.
- Or maybe worse.
- Yeah, well, what could be worse?
Like surgical alteration.
Didn't think of that, did we?
They've conditioned us
here to be so afraid.
There has got to be a place to go.
We were not born here.
We had parents on
the outside, families.
People who might still be alive.
Maybe we could find them.
I'm very worried about him.
Please, let's just go.
It sounds like if we go,
we're not coming back.
That's exactly right,
so it's gotta be something that we
all agree on or we just don't go.
- Then we should vote.
- Okay.

There shouldn't be any peer pressure.

There are still some Tchigani camped

Seven little douchkies all in a row.
How are you going to explain all this to
the inquisitor from mainstream control?
Maybe when you find them
you can bring them back here.
It might pass unnoticed.
But that's not the law.
The law requires that I take them to my
headquarters to be surgically altered.
You're not suggesting that
I break the law, are you?

Of course, you know, I could tell

what kind of stuff that is.
It could be poison.

Rabbit!
Rabbit?
You guys, come here,
come here, come here.
This is awesome.
What is it?
Look at these guys
in the weird get-up.
JASON: These guys are Eco-warriors,
fighting the Protectorate.
- Terra, look.
- What?
Look at this man.
JASON: Look, he's wearing the same
symbol you have on your hand.
METRON: Hey, Jason, come here.

This magnetron creates a force field
nearly equal to Earth's magnetic pull.
- Sounds impressive.
- It is impressive. It could hold a comet.
But it doesn't explain why it should
interest a Strictor of the E-Police.
(CHUCKLING) Could it hold
the sphere of Longiness?
Or to be more specific, could it
destroy the sphere of Longiness?
Are you suggesting
the sphere still exists?
I'm not the kind of man to take your
valuable time without a reason.
So...
You've actually found
this malignant thing.
- Could you destroy it?
- Shouldn't it go to mainstream control?
And let someone else take credit
for the destruction of it?
Well.
My facility stands ready
to serve, Strictor Grock.
METRON: Look at this. And they
said there was nothing out here.
What is this place?
JASON:
Well, it's definitely not mainstream.
TERRA: Tiretown.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
Sure, I'll tie you up,
if you can afford it.
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
RABBIT: Looking good, looking good.
(LAUGHING)
Hey, big chunk.
Two quarts and you can
spend a few hours.
- Spend a couple of hours doing what?
- Hey, come on, man. Let's go.
Spend a couple of hours doing what?
(CHUCKLES)
WOMAN: Come on, darling.
Grab a poncho, marima skirts.
They're lovely, don't you think?
MAN: Water! Fresh water!
MAN 2: Step right up

Come one, come all.
Watch the human fire-dragon.

Extra water...
I know he came this way, Malice.
I seen him. I did.
He just went round that...
MALICE: We've got him.
He's mine.
No, we wait.
We follow. We've got them all.
(MACHINERY WHIRRING)

MAN ON PA: Dayshift, note.
Partial shutdown on sectional

The water content and

Fluoride levels are acceptable.
Only those willing to combine shifts
will have a water ration increase.
All others will have a water standard
reduction by 0.25 liters per day.
This way.
He's here.
We can't wait, come on. Standing out
here is like begging for a bull's-eye.
- Quiet.
- You sure you can do this?
Sure. It's just like the old
gym lockers. Well, almost.
DARSTAR: Try 66.
The sphere better be in there,
or you're maimed.
Just turn the dial to 66,
and you'll have it.
- Sixty-six.
- Hey!
(RATTLING)
Hi, Bodhi. See,
I told you he was here.
- No. I said forget going back.
- So what are we gonna do, stay here?
- I'd rather go back to the desert.
- And die of thirst?
- I'd rather go back to the desert.
- And die of thirst?
There has got to be a place to go.
Well, until you're ready to
show us, O earth mother...
- I think we should make it.
- Make what?
- Make our own place to live.
- METRON: Make it out of what, Daniel?
Blink your eyes and take a look
at the real world out there,
'cause it's a very ugly place.
- Bodhi will help us.
- Bodhi got us here.
Metron, you should have
stayed at the orphanage.
- Hey, Terra.
- No, I'm serious!
You had a future with the Protectorate.
You should've stayed.
(DOOR SLAMS)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)
We found your owl.
I'm sorry it got killed.
- We buried it.
- I know.
Why did you take the sphere?
'Cause I thought it would do
magic for me, like it did for you.
It's not simple magic.
It's something else.
So, what are you gonna do now?
You gonna stay here?
For now, anyway.
- What about you?
- I don't know. We can't decide.
Maybe it's been decided for you.
Come on.

Terra! Terra!
Terra!
The place just exploded.
Maybe she got out another way.
Yeah. She was slick on her wheels.
Real quick.
Congratulations, Strictor.
- Now let's see what you can do.
- Our analysis will take a little time.
But I'll do everything I can
to see you're not bored.
(LAUGHING)
Not to worry. It's only a
live boy-o they pay for.
Ain't that right, old dog?
That's what the E-Piggies want.
Live young lads.
Make a man's day.
(BOTH SINGING)

Only one. Only a lonely one.
Not to worry.

Wait. We'll barter some.
Did you hear? We'll barter
for what you've got.
Bring it here.
- Let's go!
- No.
We've got value here.
We don't want to lose it.
It's only a lithe and little one.
Let's go!
(SNICKERING)
- Nothing here.
- Are you sure about that?
- Take a better look.
- Terra.
- DANIEL: Terra!
- JASON: Terra.
- TERRA: Jason.
- All right, Terra!
(DANIEL LAUGHS)
- TERRA: Daniel, I missed you.
- JASON: Terra, I can't believe this.
DANIEL:
You're okay. How'd you get out?
After all your hard work, we couldn't
let you go off empty-handed, boys.
No.
Hey, you forgot your boot.
(ALL LAUGHING)
- Hey, take it easy, fellas.
- Bye.
Yeah, take it easy.
Just get a suntan.
(TERRA LAUGHS)
- Wait till you see this.
- Hey, where are you taking us?
(LAUGHS)
- What is this place?
- This is where I live.
Water!
(WHOOPING)
- It's water!
- Water!
Tug, come on, there's more. Come on.
Hey, look. Water comes
right out of the rock.
No, it comes from here.
This is called ice.
Thousands of years ago, a giant glacier
was trapped under a lava flow.
As it melts, it feeds the
springs that make our oasis.
This is Greentree. He's my father.
- Your father? This is...
- From the picture.
These are my friends. This is Jason.
- Jason.
- Hello.
- And Rabbit.
- Rabbit.
- This is Metron.
- Metron.
Tug. And the little one
over there, that's Daniel.
(BLEATING)
I'm glad to meet Terra's family.
Now you're my family, too.
This is your home. Come on.
- Her father?
- Her father?
METRON: I don't understand.
Why doesn't the Protectorate take
over here like everyplace else?
This place is our secret
and must be kept.
So have you stopped fighting?
The Eco-wars took a great toll.
Terra's mother was taken
prisoner and killed.
Our numbers were cut. By now,
the Eco-warriors are only a rumor.
But there are new generations.
Our survival is our victory.
By some extraordinary luck,
our people found Terra and she's here.
We're all here to stay.
Bodhi doesn't call anymore.
Maybe the E-Police have...
Are we just gonna give up, Jason?
No.
What are we gonna do?
I never told you this, but Bodhi...
He showed me something.
We were headed for this place
that we still haven't found.
So it's not over, Daniel.
So you keep listening.
Listen real hard,
so Bodhi will know you're
trying to hear him.
(BODHI CRYING)
We've reached an apparent null.
I'll reduce the power.
Just keep cooking it.
I'm so happy here. We're all
gonna be very happy here.
Terra, I know what
you've found here. I do.
- But the rest of us, we gotta move on.
- No.
We left the orphanage with a purpose.
To find Daniel.
And now Daniel's safe.
We're all safe. This is our home.
Bodhi's gone. It's gone.
I can't believe you're saying that.
It's just better forgotten.
What do you mean, forgotten?
What do you know?
Come on, Terra.
Come on, Terra. We've all oathed each
other that there'd never be secrets.
But I oathed to my father, too.
And that means more?
Where's the sphere?
His men said that they took it
to the Protectorate aqua bunker.
- The what?
- The aqua bunker.
It's where they control the water.
Jason, they're gonna destroy it.
- Well, it won't happen.
- What?
You heard me. I said
it won't be destroyed.
Hey, hey, wait a minute. Wait.
It's stupid to go like this.
Terra, this is our choice. We made
the decision and we're going.
Well, then maybe this will help.
- Plans to the aqua bunker.
- Let's go. Come on.
All right!
METRON: Awesome.
RABBIT: Are you sure
we've got the right place?
Bodhi.
Enough. It's ready.
SHANDRAY: The fusion lasers have
greatly weakened the surface shield.
Now it gets interesting.
We lock it down and disembowel it.
It's all yours.
Gentlemen, this is Terminack.
He's a multi-capable masterpiece.
He can squeeze the color from a ruby,
or deftly pluck the eye
from a living bird.
And he's been programmed
to enjoy what he does.
Terminack can actually see
the molecular structure.
He'll find the flaw and punch home.
