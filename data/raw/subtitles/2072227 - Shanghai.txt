for you at the Square. right?
That foreigner girl
Not really a foreigner. Sort of
She knew something
Begged me to help her

Did she speak to anyone else?
Who cares?
She's that General's daughter
The one who scammed millions
Can you set up a meeting?
That's Mrs. Ahemadi
Can I move him to Delhi?
If You have anything else of his?
Without Tiger we wouldn't have known..
..about the second man on the truck
The police have only
arrested the driver
For drunken driving
This was no accident Aruna
Shalini had been warned
So?
What did you do about it?
If you speak up. the press will listen
People should know how
those opposing IBP are silenced
This was the Doctor's fight
- I'm not the Doctor
I'm moving him to Delhi
The senior police officers were there
How could a truck mow down
someone in their presence?
Why is this being called an accident?
Why aren't they
investigating it as an attack?
Who is being protected? And why?
I demand that this
investigation be handed..
..over to the Investigation Bureau
Did you ask them to free the truck?
Sure I did. Don't worry
Give it to Vilas to drive
Tell him to give my wife..
..a third of what he makes
My husband is fighting for his life
We need answers
We will not leave
the city without them
Come with me to the cops Gauri
- I don't know anything
You can't force me I'm not alone
We're off to the Resettlement Gauri
See you there
Don't come to work from tomorrow
My husband is in coma
We'll fight for his life
He lives
long live Doctor Ahemadi
..THE CHIEF MINISTER'S
O\FFICE HAS ANNO\UNCED..
..THAT AN ENQUIRY WIll BE SET UP..
..TO\ INVESTIGATE THE ACCIDENT..
Enquiry Sir.. me?
We don't have time for questions
Need to act before the
Central Government gets involved
But Sir for me..
IBP is in its final stage
Should I tell the Chief Minister..
..that Krishnan is not upto it?
Hello Madam
He's right here
Briefing in 10 Minutes. The
Chief of Police will be there
And the Chief
Minister's political advisor
I'll need the wireless report.
arrest records from that night
Could we find the
second man on the truck?
We cannot reveal details
like this to just anyone
Anyone?
This is the Chief Minister's enquiry.
You don't have a choice
Negi. check about dinner
The truck driver was drunk
The police arrested him
It's simple. We don't complicate it
We concern ourselves with
the police security breach..
..that led to the accident
And you will cooperate
The Enquiry is set up in Room Two
Keep quiet and make way for others
I've heard the man's a pain in the ass
That's what I've heard too
Has a question to every answer
We met at the hospital
You should meet my boss
He has information you can use
These are all the signed statements.
Give me yours too
I'll get a table fan Sir
Air Cooler. Mosquito repellant
Been waiting all morning Sir
That's General Sahay's daughter
So everything was
peaceful before the accident?
Absolutely Sir
Doctor Ahemadi stepped out
Everyone looked happy
Suddenly the truck drove in
Then you called in for backup
I had very few men
Most of the force was..
- Was with the Chief Minister
Yes. There was chaos
after the accident
So I requested for help
But you made the
request before the accident
Why?
Crowd control Sir
But you said everything was peaceful
I'm sorry?
If everything was peaceful..
..why the request for backup?
Anything out of control?
Then?
This is an internal matter
Internal?
The truck broke through security
I take full responsibility for that
But I am not allowed to reveal..
..details of our
investigation in public
Call the Police Chief
Had I known before..
..I would have taken the day
off and waited for your call
Your junior had requested backup..
..for Doctor Ahemadi's security
Why didn't it come?
You called me away from the
Inspector General's tea for this?
We have responsibilities..
..when politicians and
Bollywood stars are in town
I can't create cops out of thin air
So the force was not enough?
There shouldn't have been any
Because his permission to
speak at the hall was cancelled
You must know
Every action has a reaction
Doctor Ahemadi was
provoking the people
You cleared the way for the truck!
And you're sitting here
listening to his bullshit?
Stop right there
Don't let her in again
Get her out
Is this a playground?
You from out of town Sir?
What did that foreigner say?
Never bathe. these filthy people.
They are all spies
I represent the press
here Sir jogi Parmar
I have some inside information
If you want I could arrange a meeting
Shakeel. What's up?
Go Home buddy. Watch some cricket
You have some information?
What information do you want?
It wasn't an accident.
It was a planned attack
Know anything about it?
Who told you about a plan?
Are you giving
information or asking for it?
This is not a game madam
Why should I trust you?
Your information is correct
I have a tape
There was a plan
Such information doesn't come free
You make an offer.
I'll get you a discount
He's like a brother to me
You're Vinod the video-man's wife?
Identify the body
Go
Done?
Can't see anything
It's dark here
He should have picked a
better lit spot to die
There. Is the light good now?
Take him to the morgue
He might be alive
This one's a Voodoo healer
Makes the dead dance. let
me know when this one dances
How? What happened?
I fell off when I heard
He came over last night
Asked about the cable license
Said he had this tape. A jackpot
Know anything about that?
He tell you something?
O\kay. O\kay
let me know if you remember
He was stupid
This city is rocketing upwards
Who dies now?
Make way for them. move!
'Cow'. 'house'. 'myself'
Where is your fee?
Damle..
Damle?
Ask him when will he pay for you
In Hindi If you don't know English
This enquiry is a sham
You'll not get justice
under this Government
just give the word
I'll fly you to Delhi now
The Internal Affairs Minister..
..wants to meet you
Give it a thought
Are you taking him back to Delhi?
They want to take me. Not the Doctor
You worked with him?
I was his student
Worked four years with
him after our marriage
Carried the flag
Couldn't resettle a single
family that had lost a home
So I went back to my legal work
But who cares about real work?
We want a god. to die
and kill for. Right?
You're jealous of him
If you're this angry why're you here?
What will you do now? Real work?
O\r sit here waiting for your..
..God to open his
eyes and call your name?
Get dressed
We need to talk
I'll see you jogi
I'll call you later
You were shooting at the Square
We'll show the tapes at the Enquiry
Go show
We'll prove that the Front
goons were making trouble
Go prove
We need your tapes from that night..
..now that Vinod's tape is gone
Not my problem
He was like your brother.
They killed him
Maybe this too is an accident for you
Go back to wherever you came from
This is India. Won't agree with you
Spoken like a man
Want to see what a man can do?
Do it Whatever you want with me
I need the tape
It's Deshji's birthday tomorrow
They'll all be there
They've called me to
shoot the celebrations
Show that to the Stuffed Shirt as well
Yes.
I should watch my stroke
Could invite an Enquiry
for crossing my limits
The Assistant claims
everything was peaceful
The Chief says there was trouble
How does one write a straight report?
Write just that
lack of communication
Recommend the police
buy new wireless sets
The Assistant is ready to take the rap
Hang it on him
Where's the dessert?
Don't complicate this
Finish it
Did you have a look at
that Heart institute file?
''HEART RESEARCH CENTRE
PRO\PO\SAl GAREEMA DEVElO\PERS''
Prakash. I see only one developer's
bid for the Heart Institute
Send me the others
They still haven't sent the
truck driver's arrest record. Sir
Called the police station many times
They're ignoring us
The Chief..
Turn around
Bharatnagar police station
Who is in charge? Call him
I'll have to ask the Chief about this
This request is a week old
If you haven't asked your
Chief by now it's your fault
But sir.. - If you have and he
refused. then it's HIS fault
Then it's YO\UR fault again..
..because you didn't
inform about this in writing
look at it any way it's your fault
Where is the arrest record?
PRO\GRESS IS HERE!
What's there?
The action's on the stage
Trying to make it look grand
You sound like Vinod these days
Don't die like him. O\k?
- Damle
You're avoiding my calls?
let's feed you some meat
Hey! The dancer!
What about jaggu's truck?
You arrested jaggu. the truck driver?
Yes Sir
- This is your entry in the records?
Yes sir
Where's entry number 362?
What comes after 361?
Must be a mistake
I'll have a look
- I've had a look
Someone has torn a
page off the records
How many years in the force?
Sir. I..
- Complain to your Chief if you want..
But right now. I'm senior here
Interrupt again and
I'll have you charged..
..for obstructing the
Chief Minister's Enquiry
Mrs. Kamdar..
I used to be the
District Chief of Hawara
Heard of it?
Yes sir
leftists
Prison deaths
Torn arrest records. I've seen it all
The junior always took the rap
Any one junior to you here?
Abhijit.
I didn't tear it
Who then?
Don't be afraid
I will protect you
The Chief Minister will protect you
Something's come up..
Why're you playing
these games Krishnan?
Games?
You're out to destroy IBP
We don't need
Ahemadi now. You're enough
You're sitting on the
Heart Institute file
What do I tell the Chief Minister?
I've been busy with the Enquiry
- It's not an Enquiry any more
You've turned it into a petty turf war
Turf..
- You have two choices Krishnan
O\ne. You finish the report NO\W
O\n how police negligence led
to the accident. It's over
Two. Keep doing what you're doing
Play the leftist hero.
Grab the headlines
IBP gets bad rap. GENRO\N goes away
And instead of Stockholm
you'll find yourself
at the Governor's parade
holding his umbrella
Works for you?
Honk
Not a good idea. They're Front's boys
It happened right here
- What?
The accident you're investigating
I used to live here
The Front moved us
away to the Resettlement
It's far
You blind? Motherfucker?
''BHARATNAGAR WRESTlING CHAMPIO\NSHIP''
Waman
Pakya
Who is he?
No one
The bed's dirty
Take the chair
That's the second man on the truck
What?
He was on the truck that night
Mr. Krishnan!
We found the other man
who was in the truck!
He belongs to the Front.
like the rest of them
This isn't my office
Come tommor..
Take the disc
Thank you.
So Raam comes back from work
Is about to enter the house
A guard stops him
Big guy in a tie. Speaks English
Asks ''Who are you?''
Raam says ''This is my house.
Who are you?''
Guard says ''Nonsense''
''This is a shopping mall''
''You can have a pizza here''
''You can shop here''
''But you can't live here''
''Go live in the
Resettlement where you belong''
So Raam asks ''O\K. But can I
drink some water from my well?''
Guard says. ''Thirty
five bucks a glass''
So this is IBP GENRO\N
Mrs. Kamdar. prepare new
summons for tomorrow's despatch
We need to question more people
Take down the names
Waman Purandar
Sir.
- Prakash Shetty alias Pakya
Sir
jagannath Koli alias jaggu
Bhagirath Dolas alias Bhaggu
Yes. sir.
janardhan
Purshottamdas Sawant alias Deshji
Did we beg the State Government?
O\r the Chief Minister?
To form a Coalition?
To set up IBP?
I should go home Bhaggu
- You cried right?
Now just watch what I do
What did they feed you inside?
Fat Eggs. But you bailed him out..
..before he could take a bite
Go home. Wash up. Sleep. I'll call
Damle. What about his truck?
Fuck his truck
I told you not to come here. didn't I?
Want me to spell it out?
Ask for my head and you have it
But you can't ask me not to come here
Do I need your
permission to go to a temple?
I've got Deshji's blessings
I've got his protection
You want me to start talking?
Do you?
I'm not afraid of anyone.
Should I talk?
Someone bring an egg
I'll fry it on his head
Relax. just let Deshji do his thing
That truck will drive itself back
Promise?
- What else?
And when people let out
their rage at this injustice..
They call bureaucrats
from the capital to judge us
Go home jaggu. Wait for my call
We don't accept these summons
jogi
What is it now?
I brought some money for Vinod's wife
I'm going back to jodhpur tonight
jogi Parmar! We'll
teach you to take photos
Up there
look at the back
Were you asleep or dead?
listen. Get your Auto Rickshaw
You lose money. it comes back
life's different.
You lose it once and..
louder
louder
let's stop
Bigger action up ahead
How can the police suspend
the Chief Minister's enquiry?
The order's from the
Chief Minister's O\ffice
Mr. Kaul signed it
We'll have to take the
back door. It's not safe
Call for backup
The Chief Minister is coming Sir.
We don't have any men left
Now?
Nothing
It's over
When does your train leave?
Who do you have in jodhpur?
Everyone
Why are you here?
There was a girl
Family rank means a lot to us Rajputs
We got word one night
The girl's family
was coming to kill me
My father gave me some money
O\pened the back door and said..
Will you run? O\r will you fight?
Kukku!
Is Kukku your brother?
My father
Kukku!
Grandma can't handle the present
lives in the past
What is it?
They'll kill us Ma'am!
What's it to me?
There's no one to help us! Please!
Stay there
Don't open the door till I get there
Who was it?
Gauri
She warned me about the Doctor
I need to go
Where?
Bharatnagar
- Are you crazy?
How are you? Waiting
for the Chief Minister?
Yes.
- just a little while more
Visitors from Delhi. You
know how they discuss everything
Sit..
let's go
The Internal Affairs Minister? Here?
let's go. It's almost time
for her prayers. let's go.
How's Veena?
In her fifth month. isn't she?
Sixth
Gauri
Gauri
Ma'am
Please save us
It's O\K
Shut the door quick
Save us
The Front will kill him too
That's him
The truck driver
jaggu
You'll kill him!
let go! He'll die!
I gave you money
Sent your girl to school
I had warned you
Why couldn't you stop him?
The accident..
I mean the attack..
..was planned
The Front was involved
With a little more
time and a free hand
I can get to the bottom of this
Krishnan.
- I need your advice
Should we go on with
this toothless Enquiry?
O\r let the
Investigation Bureau take over?
They can crack this..
..much better than us
Wouldn't that be better?
Mam..
Investigation Bureau
would be the correct way
I'll hand over my findings to them
Call Mr. Kaul
Krishnan saved the State's reputation
let's end the Enquiry
Krishnan..
Send me your interim
report by the morning
I will brief the
Investigation Bureau myself
Don't be afraid
Name names
I wont give in to mob muscle
just to save the Coalition
How can you kill someone so easily?
You beat me up in front of my daughter
Because I'm nothing to you
To Deshji. you all are nothing. So..
just tell us what happened
Bhaggu used to follow Damle around
As soon as he crosses the street..
Mow him down
Take this photo
Print it in your brain
looks like a star!
What if someone comes in the way?
Run them over too. Will
look more like an accident
Bhaggu wanted to take
Deshji's blessings before the hit
Wait. He's on the phone
Then they said 'do
it in Police Square'
Then they said sit in jail
Then they got me bail
Now I'm tired of living
But scared of dying
I have a tape
Back it up in the disk
I have to go
What?
Wait for me with the Auto Rickshaw
Where are you going?
- To my studio. I know a short cut
Why?
- No
Wait for me
Krishnan was scared to seen the
Internal Affairs Minister here
He thought Delhi was
taking over the State
It's just a new Coalition
The Internal Affairs
Minister shook our hands on it
Keep it to yourself
till we announce it
The board has agreed
Delhi has agreed
You leave for Stockholm on Friday
And you're GENRO\N's
India Advisor from next month
Well done. Congratulations
Congratulations
Keep yourself free
tonight for the IBP dinner
I can't wait anymore.

What was the date?
O\f?
- The hit! What else?

I'm Tony. this is Teena.
Now we will fuck ha..
Who changed the plan?
We should have finished
this last time
I warned you. You didn't act
Now he'll keep changing
his plans. the slippery eel!
Where? Bharatnagar Police Square?
He'll regret this
just leave it to me Madam

Had you gone along the last time.
The Doctor would've been
in the obituaries by now
Fortune favours the brave
Stop it
Isn't this good enough?
He's talking about killing on tape
We can nail the bastard!
Don't let him go! - O\k.
You wanted the report
finished Sir. It's done
let's talk later.
- There's some fresh evidence
O\kay what is it?
Sir.
The Chief Minister and Deshji
planned the murderous
attack on Doctor Ahemadi
The Enquiry was a cover up
You knew this?
Eat. There are people around
Have you gone insane?
I won't take a second
more of this nonsense
But you are
Now this is what you'll do
You'll contact the Central Government
Tell them you have the evidence
Recommend that the
Chief Minister resign
And be prosecuted for murder
You think you can order me around?
I will ruin you
You won't do any such thing
You know I wouldn't do
this without insurance
The Heart Institute land request
It didn't come from the Chief Minister
We both know where it came from
It's prime location.
O\ffered to bidders for peanuts
You approved it
O\nly one bidder applied
Gareema Developers. You approved it
Your father in law owns
23%. stake in the company
Still you approved it
You're the smartest man I know
Use your smartness now
Do this
O\r else I'll surely take YO\U
down if not the Chief Minister
let's not do anything rash
let's meet for a drink tomorrow
There's no tomorrow. And I don't drink
Don't play these
games with me Krishnan
I've played them all my life.
Be warned Mr. Krishnan!
Mr. Kaul the Principal
Secretary has a message for you
Mr. Kaul has found..
very strong evidence that..
Doctor Ahemadi's accident
was in fact a planned attack
The Chief Minister was involved
Directly
And?
He wants to hand over the evidence..
..to you people in
the Central Government
But he needs your protection
He was concerned..
..if the scandal breaks..
..after the announcement
of the new Coalition..
It will hurt Delhi
Send him over
Mr. Kaul also thinks it's a good idea
to inform the Internal
Affairs Minister right away
You know how news leaks!
I'll make the call. Send him here
Sir. He is calling the
Internal Affairs Minister in Delhi
You have two minutes
Elections are up. Delhi gets IBP
You get rewarded your
political career
Is this your idea of justice?
This Chief Minister would have
made a great Prime Minister one day
India could have forged
ahead of China
''O\UR IBP. O\UR CHIEF MINISTER''
