I can cross my feet six times in mid-air
It just could do ten
but that only happen once in the Century.
Must because of the muscle's of...
Let's forget of the muscle.

Oh, not quietly, that'll be restrictful.
We tryto combine the slender and strength
Well, I've been dancing
since I was 12, and...
I don't think the muscle is over-developed?
Oh... no, not in your case.
Cause we have to trainlike gasoline
Madamebelieves rigid discipline.
You'reexpected to be in the theater tonight?
We don't go onuntil ten.
Wish Icould be there.
Why don't you come?
No, unfortunately I have journal's dinner.
Takes a lot of nerves
to miss journal's dinner.
Are you home on leave?
I haven't.
My home is in Scotland
And you have to go back
to... to France... I mean?
Tomorrow.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

Oh! Hello
I'm afraid that Kitty direct

Oh no!
But I read theletter before the wholeclass.
Were you embarrassed?
Yes, so would you, I believe?
Mh... Idare say.
I'm afraid I made it difficult for you?
Well, you... you gave up the corneal,
so I spend a time
verydifficult to see you too.

The crab is very nice, sir
And wine, thisbegins against the rule,
but dancer does drink a
littlelight wine, isn't it?
Well, tonight?
Good!
No. 14,please.
No 14,sir.
The ballet wasbeautiful!
Madamedidn't think so.
Well, experts never know.
It takes outsider to know
whenl tell you it was beautiful.
That certainlyproves you are an outsider.
You'd like to see me again.
Yes.
I sense reservation.
Well, I suppose there is one.
What?
Why?
What'sthe good ofit?
You are a strange girl, aren't you?
What'sthe good of everything?
What'sthe good ofliving?
That'sa question, too.
Oh, no, wait aminute. I'm
notlet youget away with that.
One of the thing aboutliving is
this sort of things can happen.
The shadow of desperate,
I can meet youand feel more intenselyalive,
and walking around in the peace
time, taking my life for granted.
It's high price to pay for it.
I don't think so.
I do.
Do people haveto killeach other
to give thema hiking sense oflife?
That'sgot nothing to do with
people killing each other.
Are you excited about life or you're not?
You know, I'venever been
ableto wait for the future.
When I was very young, a childin fact,
I climb to thetop branch of
ahigh tree to like a diver,
announce my horrify governance, now
I shall take a leave into the future
and I jump.
I was in the hospital two months.
You should letthe future
catch up youmore slowly.
Oh, no, can't help it, I can'thelp it.
O. K., if we met in ordinary
time withordinary way,
we're just about telling
what school we went to.
We're much further along, don't you think?
Are we?
You know we are.
Oh! I'm too excited, let's dance?
All right!
To you!
Thank you!
To us!
I still don't get enough quite.
What?
Your face.
It's all beauty, all beauty.
What is it youstill don't get?
You know when I left you this afternoon.
I couldn't remember what you
look like, not for the life of me.
I thought was she pretty?
Was she ugly?
What was she like?
I couldn't remember.
I simply had to go getback tothe
theater to see whatdoes she look like?
And do you think you can remember me now?
I think so. I think so.
For the rest of my life.
But what is itall about the
muse you still don't get?
Ladiesand gentlemen,
we nowcome tothe last dance of the evening.
I hope you enjoy the farewell waltz.
I'll tell you later, let's dance now.
What does thismean of these candles?
You'll find out.
I'll write to you.
Will you answer?
Of course.
Wonderfully evening, wasn't it?
Yes, thank you very much.
When Icome back, we'll go there again.
Yes.
There'll be our place.
That's where we're always
re-catch this evening.
You think we'll ever seen eachother again?
I think it's startful, don't you?.
Yes, Isupposeit is.
What was that you started
to tell me in the restaurant
you didn't understand about me?
Mm..., no use to go into now.
Pleasetell me, I would like to know.
Well, it strikes me curious
ever sincel meet you,
you know, veryearly moment ages ago.
That you're so young, so
lovely, so defeat-ages...
You don't seemto respect much from life?
Well, is that right?
For instance, I meet you, I like you.
And I assume so soon we'll apart,
perhaps we'll never see each other again.
You can't conceive that then.
I'll never seeeach other again.
Yes, Ican't.
This where youlive.
Yes.
Nothing to do about it, does it?
Nothing... except to say good bye.
I suppose so.
Good bye.
Good bye, Myradear.
Good bye, Roy.
Keep well!
Yes, you too, Keep well!
Mh... nothing can happen to me.
Your lucky charm will see you then.
I hopeit will.
I'll prey it will.
Good bye!
Good bye!
Pleaseleave me first.
All right.
Ah, I wish I can have this catch amended.
What I've beentelling you?

Oh! Kitty, What time is it?
It's... almost 11.
Oh!
Good morning, Madame!
Good morning!
I cometo congraduate you, Myra.
What? Madame.
On-being up. Myra.
Considering that you didn't
goto bed until 4,it's remarkable.
I havethe feeling your performance tonight
will give the effect of sleep walking.
That'sthe first time Myra's been out, Madam?
When Imade you to send the
note to the Military gentleman.
It was you I was trying to protect.
I'm fond of the girls who work for me
I don't want them to be camp followers.
You don't knowhim or you wouldn't saythat.
Can't we have any private lifeat all?
Not when it cost your public clever theater.
I'm happy thathe didn't stay here fora week.
Otherwise he would ruin six
performances instead of one.
If such thing should happened
again with you or any of the others,
It means instant dismissal
I willsee youat the theater tonight,
ifit is not too much trouble.
Oh... Why she'sso curland hateful.
Ah, the old booster...
She talks always like that.
Never mind.
Spoil everything.
Oh, rubbish!
You'reupset and tired.
Why don't you go to bed?
There's no rehearsal today.
No, I'm not tired.
Horrible morning for the JameyCrossby.
I suppose he'sgone now.
Yeah, I suppose so.
Kitty, Kitty, Look!
He's there.
Here is sergeant.
Kitty, thanks God!
He's here!
He'll be called Marshall for this
Oh, I gotta go, I gotta to!
Oh, calm down, will you?
He would certainly understand
it takesa while, Myra.
Oh, Kitty, youspeak to him too, don't you?
Well, that certainly goes to bring himup.
Oh, get away to that
window, you stupid thing...
Your feet! Youcan't take it around and...
Where is my hat?
Myra, for Christ's sake!
Oh... oh... Kitty
What ifl... what if he...
Oh! You suppose...
Oh! Dear...
Oh! Kitty...

Are you impressed?
Very much.
A captain in the rental ship
Ulserliascannot be merrycasually.
Requires men'spreposition
formelody... anything.
I see.
It's alibraryritual...
Is it?
For example, the captain
in the rentalship Ulserlias
has before he marries to
get concern of his corneal...
Is that difficult?
Well, it mightor it might notbe.
I think it's gonna be difficult.
Great deal depends upon the potentationers.
On thecharmerof potentationers,
on these others, on the eloquence.
Myra, look at me.
Yes, captain!
Don't doubt how it comes
You're very competitive, captain!

How do you do, Miss Lester.

But you can't.
You won't be back in time for the show!
I'm sorry.

She's just going, sir.
Excuseme.
Sorry.
Myra!

Myra...
Myra darling...

Oh... what a sham!
I couldn't geta taxi.
They took me to a wrong platform.
Oh... he'll be back.
He'll be all right.
The war can't last forever
Yes, he'll be back.
Good evening, Myra.
It's very condescending
for you to come here at all.
She's very unhappy, Madam!
Her fiancee was calledto the front.
I am not interested intalk moment.
She was to be merry inthe morning.
No anysocial event.
The whole world doesn't
begin and end with ballet.
My world does.
And while you are withme, so must yours.
The prescription does
no longer apply to Myra.
Oh, don't sacrifice her, Madam!
I warned you.
You are dismissed.
I've never heard such unreasonable...
Be careful, Kitty...
No, I won't becareful...
I am fed up with her.
I've been warning and telling for two
years, now I'm going to tell you...
And if you don't like it, you can loveit.
I'm sick of you and your irritability.
You treated usa lot of
slavesand chorally discipline.
Here and that.
It's just you're enjoying bulling us.
Lydia.
Yes, madam.
Rehearsal tomorrow at 11.
With "TWO" under studies.
Good night!
Well, no more ballet to me.
I am sick of the highbrow and feet.
You and I, ducky
Are going to get the interview.
Oh, we got to get to do it
some engage to put while on.
That will be simple.
Kitty?
Yes?
Do you think?
Occasionally.
What?
Do youthink you're right?
Hello.
I am back and I didn't get the job.
Kitty, you stop off me.
Did I?
Sorry.
Well, Myra, I am all
settled town, howabout you?
No luck.
There's nothing there.
No reason for looking.
Well, while I doing last
week, I didn't really expect...
How about the dress shop?
Fairly needed.
Fetero?
Filled.
Naturally.
They put me onthe waiting.
It's confidence, isn'tit?
Oh! Myra, we're a couple
of howling successes,
sitting on thetop of world, aren't we?
You'rein nicemood, aren't you?
No wonder you're sitting here and
started feeling sorry for yourself.
Lfl don't feel sorry for myself, who will?
Probably you didn't eat and you're hungry.
Come on, give me a hand.
You'll feel better when
you have something to eat.
Myra...
You'reprobably sick of sitting here...
Honestly, why don't you let Roy know...
We're out of work?
That we're broke!
Flat broke!
Down to our last tin!
Only why?
Better let him worry that we are starving.
Kitty, we're not starving.
Nobodyis starving.
You mean people starveonly totell about it.
I don't know what are we goingto do.
Can't get job in the show,
can't get anywhere else.
Madam was downhere, Igo to
her with pride orno pride.
But itis justno body.
Myra, I am frightened!
I havenever been frightened before.
I don't like it.
Oh, Kitty...
Perhaps it's selfish on
me notto let Roy know.
Perhaps it's sort of stupid pride about it...
Can't we wait just a little while?
Just alittle while longer,
something must till happen.
Lfit doesn't...
Well...
Oh, its bedge, for therent
Pretending you're in rehearsal
Oh, yes!
Miss Lester?
I am Miss Lester.
For you, Miss Lester.
Thank you.
Quite all right, Miss.
Kitty?
Flower!
I can't imagine!
Put them down here.
Oh, they're lovely!
Who do you suppose...
Kitty, it's Roy, it's handwriting.
Fifteen, eighteen, twenty...
Twenty... oh... it mustcost a pound atleast.
Oh, enough to buy a lot
of food for whole week.
While my man got leaves, you'll
be seeing these through him.
And with them I send you warm...
We could sell them to the florist to
the corner buy ourselves real meal.
But I... don't think you favor the idea?
No!
Oh! Kitty!
His mother's coming here.
To London?
Yes, yes, Listen...
My mother's launching a
few days from a Red Cross,
where is coming to town
and expect to see you.
I know you areto get well with her.
She's very nice.
In fact, she'squite like me.
Kitty, do I... I can't have herhere!
Why not?
Let's give hera little
party and rob a lot of tin.
Let's get meeting at somewhere...
For tea perhaps.
Oh! Kitty, butimaginehis mother!
I'm often not meeting with hereither.
Why are you funny of dragging them?
I wonder if she doesn't like me.
Well, she'd better.
Or won't we fire him at all!
Myra, can't be!
Oh, Kitty!
Don't you see the meeting her
will be like seeing Roy again!
Don't be such a darling to him!
Now perhaps I can start to repay you.
No.
I'll see it from now on everything
gonna take turns to turn better.
I am sure I do.
One?
No, that'll beenough one minute.
Is there any table near by the window?
I think so.
No, thank you, I'll wait
her... for my friend.
She islady Margate Cunning, I am Miss Lester.
If shecome, would youdirect her to be here?
Certainly.
What time is it... please?
It's ten minutes to five, Miss.
Thank you.
Your friend seems beenheld up.
Yes.
Surely you would like a cup of
tea while you're waiting, Miss.
Oh, no, thank you, I am sure
she'll behere any minute.
Perhaps you can take look
at these evening papers.
Oh, thank you.
Feeling better, Miss?
Here, taking another sip.
You fan, don't you?
Well, you did give us a fright?
Wouldn't you like to go the
rest room lie downa little bit?
But I... I'd rather stay
here if you don't mind.
Let's take another drop of this thing.
Better?
Sure?
I'll be all right.
Sit quiet and rest.
If your frienddoesn'tcome,
I will call a taxi.
Are you Miss Lester?
Yes.
I am Margaret Cunning, Roy's mother.
I'm afraid I get you waiting.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My train was half an hour late.
You know how this tidies day's?
But I come straight From
Scholand to keep thisappointment.
So I do hope you forgive me.
What should wehave?
Tea?
Littlecakes?
No... no, thank you.
I don't think I can stay any long.
Tea for one then, and some thin toasts.
I do hope you're not going to run off once.
I wanted so much to meet you.
But I've been so terribly busy you know,
I've been turning all country place
into a rested home for wounded men
By the way, I telephone you
from Scotland to the hotel where
Roy told me you are staying.
But they said you got away.
And then I tryto get in touch
with you through the Ballet.
But they said you've got to America.
After about a while ago when your newscame.
I havemy mails disforwarded.
There are reasons.
Oh, mydear, Ididn't mean to pride.
Forgive me, mydear...
But you're notafraid of me, are you?
I knowit is alittle bit of odd, dear,
meeting one's future children in law.
I don't remember how Idrag it...
But I am not that terrified, am I?.
I know we're going to be good friends?
I feelthat I know
youalreadythroughRoy's letter.
And I want to write him and tell him
you and I havemet and we
likeeach other verymuch.
May I write him that?
Yes, yes, of course!
I suppose there're a lot
of things you want toknow
about Roy thatl couldtell you...
And I am sure that things
about him you could tell me.
Why aren't they bring your tea?
They are very slow.
Shouldl call a waitress?
Don't bother, I'm no hurry.
Would you rather that I
didn'tspeak to you about Roy?
No, no...
Why should youthink that?
What is that to say?
Forgive me, mydear, but are you quite well?
Yes, yes, of course.
I... I had a drink...
That'sall.
That made me feel... funny.
Weird!
What did I cangot Scotland?
I had never been there.
Oh, itsounds of quange, you know that?
Had that in peace?
Pecansofisland?
I've been there neither.
Why are you stared at me like that?
I am trying tosee youas Roy sees you.
Myra, I want you to remember
that I try to be your friend.
I havecome because Roy wantedme
to come, andbecausel wish to.
Perhaps we'll try again someday.
Perhaps on Roy's next leave
he'll bring you tothe country.
Bye-bye!
The lady is leaving, Miss.
Myra!

Who isit?
Does Miss MyraLester gone out? Mrs. Clack?
What? What isit?
Where is Miss Lester?
How should I know? She went out.

About an hour ago.
You should've never let her.
You know she'snot well enoughto

This is not nursing house, Miss
Melody, not your nursing home.
Myra, where have you been?
Whatever made you go out at night likethis!
You will got the cold in rain too.
Now you come on and stay in bed.

I thought I surprise you by calling for you.
Oh, yeah!

Kitty, you do it for me
to buyme foodand medicine.

No, no, you wouldn't.
You think you would, but you wouldn't.
I thought of that.
But it wasn't brave enough.
I wanted to goon living.
Heavenknows why, but I didn't, so would you.
We're young, and it's...
It's good to live!
Even the life that I'mliving now...
God knows

And I wasn't there to help you.
But that's allover now.
I'm going to make up for you.

That'll be marvelous!
Thanks, Mother, good bye.
That'sall set.
Roy, you mustn't!
What is it?
I can't go to the country with you.
It's... quite out of the question.
Why not?
Pleasedon't ask me, but I... Isimply can't.
Don't ask, God! You'vegot to tell me.
All right.
I lookterrible for one thing.
I haven't haveany clothes.
I... Ireally can't goanywhere.
Ha... ha, you little fool.
Let metell you one thing,
I think you're exaggerating.
Now when I look at you, I perhaps
understand what are your say?
Well, Madame Cunning to be,
we'll see what we can do?
How would liketo be the
smartest woman in London?
No, Roy, I can't.
Well, darling...
I am afraid I have been
stupid, conceived stupid.
Cause you've never been
out of my thought, so I...
I tookit for granted that
it was the same with you.
There's someone else, isn't it, Myra?
After all, youthoughtl'm... dead!
There is someone else, isn't it?
Don't be afraid to tell me.
Roy, of coursethere isn't anyone else.
There couldn'tbe.
I love you
I never love anyone else.
I never shall.
That'sthe truth, Roy.
That'sall I want to know.
Oh, darling, smile fora change.

Kitty, he wants to merry me.
Oh, no, that things don't happen.
It's true
Oh, Kitty, it's going to be so wonderful.
For you too.
No things willbe too good
for you when I am Roy's wife.
Oh, I know what you'rethinking.
I havebeen thinking too.
You think that'll be dreadful owl, don't you?
Does he know?
No.
Do youthink you can get away with it?
You mean deserving him?
Yes.
Oh, I'm going to tell him.
There are two sorts of people, Myra.
Those who get breaks and those who don't!
Well, I'm going to take a break.
Now I am not going to think.
You remember you once said
that you wanted to live?
Well, I want to live.
This is my chance for last.
I won't let him go.
He's so kind, Kitty, so
sweet, clean, and wonderful.
I'll devote myself to him.
After all, hishappiness too, Kitty.
He... he loves me, he's waited for me.
And mysoul... I've waited for him.
Tell me, I cango to him, please.
Guess there's no rules, Myra.
For what you feel, what he feels.
Kitty!
After all, he's mad enough about you.
May make up for everything.
Must! Must!
Oh, try it.
Go to him!
Oh, Kitty.
The ancestor'sstraw aches, Myra.

Oh, it's beautiful, simply beautiful.
Mother will take you all over these.
You must turn right toshow you a thing.
Seeingall of these first timeon earth.
Being enthusiastic too.
That one will be difficult.
It must be wonderful to spend one's
childhood in a place like this.
Yeah, it's great when you're young.
When you're really young.
Oh! Roy.
Do youthink yourselfis old?
No one's spendthis war is young.
Now that's true.
You remember long for those line

Myra!
Yes, Roy.
We areoverly good to get

Rips, I mean that was a question
requires an answer "YES" or "NO".
Yes.
Your answer iscorrect.
Hello, how are you, darling?
Mother!
Myra, I am so glad to see you again, my dear.
Isn't it wonderful Roy
finding you so quickly.
I really believe that providence.
I am sure of that, mother.
You're very kind, ladyMargaret.
Roy, Ido hope you haven't show Myra anything.
I wantto showher around myself.

More every minutes.
She dances beautifully, doesn't she?

Those Crunningman, they're always
attractive by girls who undressed in public.
Why don't you try that, Lela.
Ho, I haven't done that.
I am not quitesure I got the figure.
All I can see is that there
are plentyof charming girls,
of good familyin the county
who wouldjump off to Roy.
And I don't mean moneyspeak victory.
I wonder if she can arrange.
Never heard of her.
Is there any one ever seen herdance?
Well, evidently, Roy seen

most anxious moment in mylife?
Did I?
When?
When I was waiting in a

You are outside in thecab?
Why didn't he bring you in?
I don't suppose he dare.

rather limited of social ideas.
What good enough for our fridge to
grade good enough meat sortof things.
You see that emblem?
Mm...
Brokenlodge.
Our arrangement battleridge.
Roy wears one too.
Lately, the only way we
keep up to thetradition
is to lead thedull life
from many oneof themselves.
Do youthink of dancers,
someone who little of races...,
Shouldl say, put it in mind... Mm... ha...
Too bad you can't liveup to
that idea, Myra, isn't it?
You may go to fun, wouldn't it?
Yes, I would.
But Roy's instinct tells him what you are.
My instinct tells me too.
You'resound, and good.
That bad is never going
to suffered your head.
Lfl will haveshown that, I
wouldn't welcome you as Ido now.
Myra?
Well, thanks alot.
I think I've been morethan generously
for you've beenso long with Myra
The longer will be fool, honey.
Here'sher, Roy.
You'd better take her away before
she discovers the facts in the mask.
ListenMyra...
I had them played, let's dance.
Excuseus, sir.
Thank you.
For what? For what?
Go andenjoy yourself.
Remember, darling? Thecandlelight club...
It's forever go, isn'tit?
And yes, "tonight"!

Do I disturb you?
Oh, no.
Pleasecome in, lady Margaret.
I'm not very gently... so in case
you're asleep, I shouldn't wake.
Won't you sit down!
I thought you be awake.
I say she's far too
happier excited tobe asleep.
Two things keep one up.
Very happinessand very miserly.
Don't you think so?
Yes.
I couldn't go to sleepeither without
getting something off mychest,
So to speak you American said.
Are you sure you are not too tired?
No, no, of course not.
It's about ourlast meeting inLondon.
That is preyedin my mind eversince.
Do youbear graduates me for that, Myra?
Oh, no, lady Margaret.
I came with prejudice.
When Isaw you, you seemed strange to me.
I thought you couldn'tbe...
Well... what I wanted Roy's wife to be.
I haveno excuse except mother's excuse for
wanting any possible idea for her son.
Can you forgive me?
But I have nothing to forgive.
When Igot home the next day,
I found the telegram telling
the drafting newsabout Roy.
And when couldthink again...
It suddenly struck me that
youhad known all the time,
that you've just seen his namein paper.
And you hardlyknew what you're saying.
Is that truth?
Yes.
Oh, you poor child ifl only know.
I did my very best to find
you, but you disappeared.
And now I wantto makeit
up to you inthe future.
I am very happy about this marriage, Myra.
And I know we are going
to be wonderful friends.
Forgive me forbeing sentimental.
Good night, mydaughter.
Lady Margaret!
Lady Margaret!
Lady Margaret!
Yes, Myra!
I mustspeak you.
Why, of course, Myra.
I can't merry Roy.
Sit down quietly, dear, tell me.
I must go away.
I should nevercome here.
I knewit is impossible.
...But, I keptconceiving myself.
I got to go away... I...
I mustn't see him again.
My dear, why don't youtell me what itis?
I'm sure I canhelp you.
No, noone canhelp me.
But mydear, what can it
be that is soterrible?
Has there beensomeoneelse?
Oh! Lady Margaret... you are nice.
Myra?!
Yes!
Yes! Yes!
Myra!?
Yes, that's all true.
It's on your mind, but you're
telling yourself it can't be true.
It's true!
Myra!
Yes!
Why didn't youtell him?
I didn't have the courage.
Or I can give plenty of reasons.
I was hungry, I was poor
I... IthoughtRoy wasdead... but...
I could make you understand...
but it would tell...
I don't know what to say?
But it's my fault as much as yours...
for not havingunderstood,
fornot having taken care of...
Oh! Don't be nice to me!
Lfl...
Ifl leave early in the morning...
Ifl never seen Roy again...
Would you promise me he'll never know?
I couldn't bear hurt him like that.
Myra!
Oh! Let us wait until morning.
Let's think this over.
Would you promise?
I promise.
Thank you.
You'vebeen sogood.
I wishl could've beenall youhope... but
Myra!
What're your little game about?
Why are you doing crawling
around at this hour?
You'vebeen with mother?
Yes.
Isn't she wonderful?
Yes, she is.
Honey, I wouldn't sleep so
I've been walking in the garden,
confronting mygood luck to the stars.
Were they pleased?
Mm... they seemto different.
They wouldn't do glaring,
they're little exhibitions.
Oh!
Have you ever seen this before?
I think so
Here.
But I gave it to you, it's yours.
I think it'll be saver
with you, just as are we.
I dropit in the garden momentago, I
was finding it until I found it again.
I think you'd better have
it from now on, because...
now weare both, as they said, one...
Reallydoesn'tmatter which
one keeps it, doesn't it?
It brought me luck.
Now it will bring you luck
I'll keep it for you, Roy.
I'm tired, darling.
Yes, you look tired.
Penestratenousday for you, darling.
Good night, darling
Good bye, darling.
Why good-bye, it's only for a morning...
Because every parting from you,
is... is like a littleeternality.
