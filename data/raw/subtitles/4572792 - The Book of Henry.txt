People are decent, mostly.
I say mostly because
we all know there are some
real pricks out there.
People are decent because they
never forget how to reach out.
Now and then,
they'll even surprise you.
But then again,
sometimes they won't.
I wanna be remembered as the
awesomest dodgeball player ever.
I wanna win an Olympic
gold medal in dodgeball.
This will make the world
a better place 'cause
I'll inspire other kids
to be dodgeball champions.
And that's what I
think about my legacy.
Good, Tommy.
A little basic,
but some solid grammar
and paragraph construction.
Well done.
Who wants to go next?
Henry?
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
We can all talk
about making our mark,
but isn't it just comfort food
to stave off existential crisis?
I mean, in the end, Tommy,
you're gonna realize that
dodgeball isn't
even an Olympic sport.
But our legacy isn't what
we write on our résumé
or how many commas we have
in our bank account.
It's who we're lucky enough
to have in our lives
and what we can
leave them with.
The one thing we do know,
we're here now.
So I say we do the best we can while
we're on this side of the dirt.
And that's what I
think about my legacy.
Henry.
Remind me again why we can't
put you in a gifted school.
'Cause it's better for my
psychosocial development
for me to interact
with a peer group
in a normal
school environment.
Oh, yeah. Okay.
Thank you.
And so that's 3,000 of TannenTech
at 76 with a stop-loss at 70?
And, you know what?
Give me ten Liffcom with Aluminad.
Uh, two and a quarter.
Okay, yeah.
I think it'll work.
Oh, let's just say
I had the benefit
of being born
into a bull market.
Sorry I'm late.
Buckle up.
Wrestle this backpack.
I really wish
you'd get a new car.
It's not like you can't
afford it or anything.
That isn't the point.
And besides...
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.
Why won't
you let me help?
I only broke one
of them. Over.
Which led to an electrical fire. Over.
Waffle irons
are tricky. Over.
I just wish I could make
something like you do.
Okay. Come on, then.
Okay, what do you wanna make?
A flying trampoline.
You might
wanna start small.
Rocket boots.
Mmm, that's kind
of hard, too.
Okay. You have to
build in a fail-safe.
It's all about timing, setup,
covering every contingency.
One little miscalculation,
and the whole thing fails.
Like the waffle iron?
Waffle irons are tricky.
What if there are sharks?
Too shallow.
How about piranhas?
Indigenous to Africa.
Henry says South America.
Fine,
South America.
But don't you worry,
if anything attacks you,
anything indigenous
to our region,
I'll be in here
in a flash.
Okay?
Oh, what the heck!
Okay.
You okay?
Yep.
Call out the capitals.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Easy.
Augusta, Maine.
Salem, Oregon.
Albany, New York.
Hey, Mom, what is this charge
for $147.50 at Funtime Cove?
Uh, bouncy castle
for Peter's birthday.
The one that
smelled like feet.
Bismarck,
North Carolina.
Isn't that one of
the other Norths?
Tallahassee, Florida.
Did our financial statement
come in the mail today?
Juneau, Alaska.
Yeah, I forgot to give it to you.
You should really read it
and know what it says.
Annapolis, Maryland.
Wrong.
Right.
Cheyenne, Wyoming.
You know it
doesn't actually help
when you lean
into it like that.
Sure it does.
Look at that.
Look at that!
"So he dyed his coat all
the colors of the rainbow.
"Then the other squirrels
were jealous and sorry
"because he looked
punk rock awesome.
"And they learned
that real coolness
"isn't about
the color of your fur,
"it's about what
you've got beneath it.
"The end."
So?
Um, it was well-told.
Hey!
You try writing and drawing something.
It's about something.
It's a metaphor.
It seems
someone hasn't grasped
the blue squirrel's
moral of acceptance.
Young Engineer Award?
When did you get this one?
It's no big deal.
I'd be psyched if I won that.
I wouldn't just
toss it in the corner.
You can have it.
Okay. Let's get your
little tushies into bed.
You think I'm running
a nightclub here?
Can we do
movie night tomorrow?
Oh. I can't, hon,
I've got the dinner shift.
Mom, I told you, you don't
have to work anymore.
What do you mean, she doesn't
have to work anymore?
Nothing.
I'm just saying,
it's not necessary.
Just stay home
and work on your storybooks.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Are you sure?
Because... I mean,
I don't wanna invade
your sense of personal
space or anything...
Mom!
Good night.
On or off?
- On.
- Off.
Open or closed?
- Open.
- Closed.
Yikes, it's hot.
Hey, Mom?
Yeah.
You double-click here...
Easy!
It's expensive.
Then you download the bank statement
directly into the program.
Who says you're not smart?
No one.
Show me what I
just taught you.
I'm not a child, Henry.
Show me.
Okay. That's enough.
Um, let's see.
You just deleted last month.
You're not doing
that right.
What?
Here, Mom.
Susan.
Oh, great. It's Glenn.
Mr. Sickleman.
Susan.
Hey.
I was wondering, would you mind
keeping an eye on your lawn?
Your unraked leaves are
blowing over to my property.
It's just hard to keep up.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I'll try.
Sorry, Glenn.
Hey, sweetie.
Hi.
Come here.
Hey!
Look at you.
Hey.
Found this in the
woods.
Little cops in training,
huh, boys?
Sorry, uh, to be a pain
about the leaves.
I know it doesn't seem like a big deal,
but... No, no. It is. I... I get it.
Um, moving forward, I vow to
mind my leaf distribution.
Appreciate it.
My future daughter-in-law.
Oh, God.
She's adorable.
But her stepfather...
Ugh!
Glenn?
Mr. Sickleman.
Late again.
Dog ate my car.
Table seven says their eggs are
too wet, so have fun with that.
Hey, toots,
how's tricks?
Oh, the Feds are all over me.
Had to move money into
my Swiss bank account.
And the rates are terrible.
Tell me about it.
When I won the lottery,
you should have
seen the taxes.
$82,000,000 turned into $16,000,000.
What am I gonna buy with that?
Hey, table seven is real.
You sell the castle yet?
Corsica, but I'm having a hard
time unloading Monte Carlo.
My boobs are up here.
Yeah, geez.
Miss?
This isn't what I ordered.
Hey, Susan?
The new payroll gal ain't
exactly the brightest.
She mailed your
paycheck home
even though I told her you
were coming in today.
It's a nice
neighborhood you live in.
I always figured you
for an apartment somewhere.
Thank God for alimony,
huh?
Yeah, right.
I guess I could just set you up with
direct deposit if that's easier.
Uh, I don't know.
I'll have to ask Henry.
You have to ask
your 11-year-old?
Twelve. He's almost 12.
Henry!
I need your help!
Morris took your medal!
Hurry! Let's just go!
Hey!
Thank you, Dot.
There he is.
Hey, Christina.
You okay?
Yeah. I'm good.
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Henry! Henry!
Peter! Hey!
Henry!
Let him go!
Henry!
The medal!
What's your problem, dude?
I told you to stay away from him.
He's a little douche bag.
You, you're smart at least.
But him?
All right,
come on, guys, break it up.
He's a nothing.
He's a nothing.
Where were you?
Remember that!
I'm sorry. Shh!
Thank you, let's go.
Come on, Peter.
I just said sorry to you,
like, a thousand times.
Oh...
I promise I will not
let Morris near you again.
Okay? I promise.
I bet I can
make you smile.
Mom's home!
Hello?
Oh, my munchkin!
What...
Geez, Henry. Just say no.
Surprise.
Sheila!
Aw. Hello, Peter.
Hank.
It's actually Henry.
I think you'd be able
to retain at least
one simple name somewhere
beyond that haircut.
Nice goggles. They go well
with your misshapen head.
Don't you two
start already.
Now, I'm gonna pretend
all this didn't happen,
'cause I've had
a hell of a day,
and Sheila and I are just gonna
hang out a little. Okay?
They're gonna get
so drunk right now.
I know.
I heard that.
My mom...
But my mom was a bitch.
But she was,
like, she wasn't.
She would try to...
She scared my friends.
How?
You know those, um,
like, Dracula teeth?
Yeah. For Halloween?
Yeah.
And if a... If a guy
asked me out at all,
and he would come over,
she would wear her Dracula teeth.
Ugh, God.
And then she'd just, like...
Slowly smile, like...
Oh, maybe she was
being protective.
She was horrif...
She was being protective.
Aw.
She was great.
She was just trying
to raise me right.
She failed miserably.
But she should win an award.
Please don't let
me screw 'em up.
I mean, you just do
the best you can, right?
But they're kids, little
tiny creatures in the world,
waiting for life
to just happen.
I don't know
how you do it.
Honestly, I don't know how
you do it all by yourself.
Come on. I have Henry.
Find me another male of the species
who's more grown-up than him.
I'd like to.
Can I sleep here?
Henry! Let's move it!
There you go.
Hey, sweetie. You okay?
Uh, fine. Why?
What's with the face?
Uh, nothing.
It's just a headache.
Okay.
Hey, sweetie.
Need a lift?
You okay?
Yeah.
Now for some bad news.
Zach's mom dropped off
donuts for his birthday.
Yeah!
Okay, class.
Time to start thinking about your
acts for next month's talent show.
I'm handing out forms now.
So, be sure to bring back
parents' signatures.
Henry, where are you going?
Henry!
God damn it, Janice. How much
longer does this have to go on?
What else do you need to see?
I believe you mean
Principal Wilder.
Henry, we're not going
down this road again.
Bruises, exhaustion,
decreased school performance?
What have her
grades been this year?
You know I can't
tell you anything
about another
student's grades.
You're under no
obligation to investigate.
You need merely
report suspicion of.
It's your ethical
responsibility as an educator.
I made preliminary
inquiries which turned...
So make secondary inquiries.
Which turned up nothing.
It's more complicated
than that, Henry.
Mr. Sickleman is
the Police Commissioner
and an upstanding member
of this community.
As if upstanding members
of the community don't...
These type of
baseless allegations
can have extremely
serious ramifications.
Jesus, do...
Do these things
mean anything?
I have known Mr. Sickleman
longer than you've been alive.
Don't condescend to me.
I'm not gonna subject him to public
scrutiny without conclusive evidence.
Fine.
I will handle
this without you.
Henry Carpenter,
come in. Over.
When do you think Mom's
gonna be here? Over.
Sorry!
Where are we going?
We have to
stop by Sheila's.
She was supposed to work the morning
shift, but she didn't show up.
Stop that.
Sheila!
Hello?
Found her.
Oh.
Lovely.
You brought the children.
Hello, Hank.
Sheila.
Looking radiant as ever.
Let me guess.
Drinking away
memories of that ex
who left you in the lurch
with two young boys?
That was you.
Oh, yeah.
I covered for you at work.
Come on. Get up.
No!
No. Have a sip.
You're weakening.
Yay.
Oh, yay.
Oh, us.
It's really great how you
enable her alcoholism.
Sheila is not an alcoholic.
Yes, she is.
Would you relax?
Honestly, she's such
a sharp dresser.
Didn't acid wash
go out before I was born?
Compared to some of the
shit in her closet... Mom.
That's nothing.
Don't curse
in front of Peter.
Like it matters anymore.
"Mom has
a two-headed baby."
Bet that made for
a trying delivery.
Right in the middle
of the damn freezer.
You had all day, you've had
all day to talk about it.
Henry.
It's none of our business.
You'll only
make it worse.
Hey!
I don't care!
Are you kidding me?
Henry. No.
Stop. Come on.
Child Protective Services.
How can I direct your call?
Uh, hello? Uh...
Hello?
Can I help you?
Uh, yes.
Can I have the intake
caseworker, please?
A caseworker? That's me.
How can I help you?
Oh, hi. Um, I'd like to
report a child abuse case.
Okay.
Um...
Is somebody hurting you?
No, it's not me.
How old are you, honey?
Eleven.
And what's going on?
Um...
Where can I reach you?
Look, I'm not... I'm not gonna
give you my phone number.
That's why I called the anonymous
reporting line. Get it?
Okay. Stay calm.
Henry!
How can I help?
Um, the address is
3328 Spindle Lane.
And the abuser's name
is Glenn Sickleman.
Um, thank you
very much. Goodbye.
Wait.
Don't hang up. Hold on...
Hey, Henry.
Hey.
For your brother.
It's one of mine.
It's, um, very
considerate of you.
I hope he likes it okay.
Hey, sweetie.
Henry told me you're gonna
do a dance next month.
Can't wait to see it.
Hey, Glenn.
You must be excited about
the talent show. Oh.
Yeah. I... I confess, I get a little
impatient at things like that.
I... I thought Janie's
mom was taking you?
Jenna.
They're out of town that week.
Well, I can,
I'm happy to take her.
I'll, uh...
I'll pick her up.
Great.
Mrs. Carpenter?
Sweetie, please. Susan.
Henry and Peter,
they're lucky to have you.
Thank you.
And your father's
lucky to have you, too.
Stepfather.
I want you to stop
focusing on academics
and spend a little
more time goofing off.
Pick up a bad habit
or something.
Gambling, booze,
get hammered, rob a bank.
Come on!
You're no fun.
Mom?
Mmm.
That woman today,
at the grocery store,
you didn't do
anything to help her.
I told you,
just wasn't our business.
I think when someone hurts someone else,
I... I think it is our business.
Well, I know
it seems that way,
but there was
nothing I could do.
Yeah. Mom, if...
If everybody did that,
then there would be no one
to look out for the people
who just can't look
out for themselves.
So what should
I have done?
I didn't want things
to get violent.
Violence isn't the worst
thing in the world.
What is, then?
Apathy.
I don't know why they would've called.
Basically...
Hey, Christina.
How are you?
"Sickleman."
Four-hundred foot drop to the south,
and deep water to the north.
Here?
Keep going.
Here?
Keep going.
But if I go any further,
I'll fall in.
Okay. Now hold up
some fingers.
Three.
Roger that.
Yeah, that's what
I'm looking for.
How many rounds per minute?
Twelve-hundo.
What's she run?
Eight.
Eight hundred dollars?
No,
eight hundred drachma.
Funny.
Needs a license, I suppose?
Yeah. Federal.
Yeah. Well, I left
that one at home today.
Yeah, I'm sorry, sir. I don't
run that kind of establishment.
And what if
Domenic sent me?
Be $1,100.
Yeah, okay. Come around
back in a half an hour.
Give my regards
to Domenic.
Jesus, Mom. Really?
Know why they call me
the Can Opener, Henry?
No. But I'm guessing it has
something to do with whoop-ass?
Oh, come on.
Turn it off.
Just as soon as I level
up on these motherf...
Mom!
Enchilada number one.
Enchilada number two.
How come he gets to be
enchilada number one?
'Cause he's older.
It's fine. You can be
enchilada number one.
All right.
Enchilada number one.
Good night.
Good night.
Uh, Mom, not again.
Sing it.
Okay. Fine.
Before you,
I thought I lost
They called the game,
but not for us
Drowned in thought
and caught in a stare
Talkin' to things
that are not there
Then you took my hand
Transformation began
Commotion where
it once was still
Fireworks explode
Front row tickets to the show
This hand,
I will never let it go
Your hand,
I will never let it go
Good night.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Love you.
That is not a one-way
street, you know.
Love you, Mom.
On or off?
- On.
- Off.
Open or close?
- Open.
- Close.
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Mom! Mom!
God. What is it?
Mom!
I'm coming!
Mom! Mom!
Mom!
Henry.
Henry. Henry, baby.
Honey. Oh, my God.
Call 9-1-1, Peter!
I got you. I got...
Oh, God, Henry.
He looks postictal,
but we've got a strong pulse.
Henry? Henry?
Henry, can you hear me?
Mrs. Carpenter, your son.
Henry?
Your other son.
- I need to get some history.
- Get him some blood...
- Where's my CT?
- Still waiting for it.
Thank you, Kathy.
Mrs. Carpenter, my name is David Daniels.
I'm a neurosurgeon.
Hi.
Let's see what's
going on with you, pal.
Now Henry, I'm gonna shine
this light in your eyes.
Did you witness the seizure?
Yes.
What did it look like?
Um, his whole body was
shaking and jerking.
Has he been
having headaches?
No.
Nothing major. Just...
You have?
For how long?
Three... Three, four months.
Dr. Daniels,
you asked for these.
You said it wasn't
anything serious.
Why didn't you say
something, honey?
Kathy, we need
to take him upstairs.
What? Where are
you taking him?
We need to take
him to surgery.
Your son has a definite mass,
and it looks swollen.
It's abutting some
critical structures.
I know this is hard for you, but
we need your consent to proceed.
Dr. Daniels, he's seizing.
I...
Push one mil
of Ativan, stat.
Henry?
Mrs. Carpenter,
we need you to
sign off on this.
I can't sign
this without asking him.
We need parental consent.
It's all right, Henry.
- When did he last get his...
- There we go.
It's all right.
Come on. All right. Let's go.
All right. You're all right.
You're all right.
Henry, we're gonna
take you to the O.R.
Mom?
Hey, baby.
Yeah. I'm here.
I'm right here.
Is... Is everything okay?
Um...
What about this?
Will you at least
eat the brownie?
Hey, kiddo.
Glad to have you back.
You must be Peter.
What do you say, you give me a moment
to talk to Henry and your mom?
That be all right?
Yeah, why don't
you come with me?
Henry, you've got something
in your head right now,
something we call a tumor.
It's not a good thing.
So we had to see if
we could remove it
without hurting any
part of your brain.
Uh...
It's tricky stuff.
And we were able
to get some of it.
Come on, man.
Excuse me?
This kind of rapid onset,
cutting right away,
the expression
on your face,
the way I see it,
it's got to be
a high grade ependymoma
or a glioblastoma.
I don't know why I
didn't think about that.
I... What with the headaches and the...
The blurred vision,
I just thought
it was stress.
Large mass?
Uh...
Yeah.
Extended?
Yeah, it is.
Has it spread to
critical structures?
Well, we tried to resect it.
But unfortunately...
I see.
My MRI?
Irradiate?
I'm sorry.
I'd like to be alone, please.
Sweetie, I don't think...
Mom.
Um...
I'd like to be alone.
Okay.
Okay, class,
Henry is going to be
in the hospital
for a little while.
He's really sick.
So, I thought it
would be a nice idea
if we all sent him
some get well cards.
Is he
gonna be all right?
Well, Tommy...
He has to, doesn't he?
I mean, it's Henry.
He's got to be okay.
We don't know just yet.
Hello, Hank.
Hey, fashion roadkill.
What you doin'?
Workin' on some notes.
Mmm. Think you're pretty
brilliant, don't ya?
I prefer "precocious."
Shit, Hank. Why'd you
have to go and do this?
Henry.
Look, even though we...
I know.
It's called
reaction formation.
What?
It seems we have
an antithetical relationship.
But we're just
behaving towards each other
the opposite of
how we really feel.
I think you're pretty,
thus, I insult you.
Childish, yes.
But I am a child.
You take care, Hank.
Do you have a 9?
Do you have a 10?
Go fish.
Um...
Hey, Peter, they have good
ice cream in the cafeteria.
Would you mind
grabbing me some?
Here, sweetie.
So, I was thinking
when we get out of here...
Mom, I need you to bring in
the financial files.
Oh, don't you
worry about that.
They're in the second file
drawer in my cabinet.
Not now.
I also need to get a hold
of the retirement statements.
Let's talk about it next week.
I may not be here next week.
I'm... I'm just
gonna get some water.
I don't want any.
Me, neither.
Peter?
I have to tell you something.
And it's very important. Okay?
After...
After...
It's essential
that you make sure
Mom reads my red notebook.
Okay?
But not you. Just Mom.
I want you to
make her yourself.
Peter, I'm trusting
you to do this
because you're the person I
trust most in the world.
Take care of Mom, okay?
Where are you gonna be?
I don't know.
It'll be good.
Everyone'll want to
be friends with you.
Come here.
It's okay.
I'm gonna make
everything better.
And if Liffcom gets
above 200, dump it.
I think we've leveled down the
energy sector, so all good there.
You listening to me?
What?
You need to buy
a new car already.
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.
Put you in some long-term bonds.
Triple tax free.
I said I didn't want
to talk about that.
You'll have to
read the statements
and check in with Rob
every once in a while.
Mom, this is really important.
No. It's not
important at all.
Keep an eye
on the tech stocks.
You have to watch them
closer than the others.
I said I don't want
to talk about it. Okay?
I don't give
a shit about any of it.
I'm sorry.
I'm scared.
I don't know how to...
I don't know how to
do it without you.
I don't know how
to be a mother.
I never taught you that.
You always knew
how to be a mother.
You're the
best part of me, Henry.
The best part of me.
Can't...
- Henry? What are you...
- Mommy!
Baby, what are you doing?
Henry? Henry?
Hello? What?
What's going on?
What's going on?
What is it, baby,
what is it?
The window.
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna get a doctor.
What is it?
Breathe. Breathe.
Mommy.
Breathe.
Mom? I want Mommy.
Yes. I'm here.
I am here. I am here.
Mom's here.
Mommy's here.
Mommy. Mommy.
It's okay. Shh.
I want to see the sky.
I want to see the sky.
You want to see the sky?
Look up. Look up, baby.
Fireworks explode
Front row
tickets to the show
Mom?
Hey.
So...
I had an idea.
I had an idea.
It's just a start,
but it's something.
See, we're gonna
eat dessert all week.
Nothing else.
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Fuck it.
Don't swear in front of me.
Look at this beautiful day.
Mommy?
You didn't expect it all
to stop for this, did you?
Mom?
It's still beautiful out.
Life goes on, right?
Mommy!
What?
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
I...
I'm just having
a tough time right now.
It's because when you lose
someone close to you...
Don't talk to me like that.
Like what?
Like a child.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
I don't know
what to do. I don't...
I don't know.
What would Henry do?
Don't do what Henry would do.
Do what you would do.
What would you do?
I don't know.
Oh.
Am I early?
Um...
I mean, we said 4:30,
but if it's not a good time, I can...
No, I... I...
I just forgot, and...
I don't usually
make house calls,
but I wanted to see
how you and Peter were doing.
Thank you.
Is... Is Peter home?
Yeah, yeah.
Come, come in.
Hey, there.
Hey.
I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.
Are you all right?
No.
What's wrong?
My head hurts.
It does?
Where?
Here, let me take a look.
Hmm.
I think your
heart hurts, kiddo.
I thought my heart
was down here.
I'll give you my card.
It's got my
cell number on the back.
If your head
hurts like that again,
just give me a call.
Deal?
Deal.
Ma'am, you work here?
Excuse me.
Uh, ma'am?
Hey, um, is this regular
or Diet Coke?
Hmm.
Diet.
Susan? Uh...
Can I, uh...
Yeah?
Maybe you came back
a little too soon.
What? I'm fine.
No...
No, you're not fine.
Uh...
Your boy sent this
from the hospital.
He says you have, like,
$680K in a checking account,
even more in stocks
and bonds.
Says in there that you can
afford to take a break.
And I think you should.
He...
He was a smart kid.
Look, this isn't
a request, Susan.
I'm sorry.
Hey!
Are you...
Yeah.
I'm great. I'm fine.
Yeah, I've...
I've gotta run, I've...
I dented the grill
on my Maserati again.
Can you believe it?
I had to fly a mechanic
in from Milan to, um...
It's a whole thing.
I... I have to get
home to my two boys.
Does anyone wanna
trade for a piece of fruit?
Want the last cupcake?
I'm home!
Mom! Mom!
Yeah?
I think Henry
wants us to kill Glenn.
Mr. Sickleman?
"Keep in mind that not everyone
goes through all five stages,
"and you don't necessarily
go through them in order.
"Each of these theories
emphasizes the vital importance
"of remaining busy
through the grieving process,
"and putting oneself to task."
I don't think the task they had
in mind was killing Glenn.
Mr. Sickleman.
Just turns my stomach
to think he would...
Do what? I didn't
understand it all.
Uh, just not being a good
parent to Christina.
I'm gonna call
Child Protective Services.
"Why calling Child Protective
Services is not a plausible option."
Well, there has to be someone
else we can call to handle this.
He already
tried everything.
Oh, come on, Peter. There gotta
be stuff he didn't think of.
Stuff Henry
didn't think of?
This is ridiculous.
There has to be another way
to help Christina.
"Why there's no
way to help..."
I'm not having this
conversation with you.
We have to.
It's Henry's dying wish.
We are not murdering
the police commissioner,
and that is final.
I get that
the investigation is closed.
That's why I'm
trying to see if...
Right.
"Won't harass an upstanding
member of the community"?
You sure you
don't mean "powerful"?
No, that doesn't
make any sense.
Oh, just...
Yes, I understand
that the caseworker
has to be within
the same region,
but I was just hoping to get an
outside opinion, that's all.
I'm sorry,
it's out of ourjurisdiction.
We are talking about...
We are required to follow
standard operating procedure.
Right, but isn't there
a point where
standard procedure
is less important than...
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
You can file an appeal...
Seriously?
Damn it!
I love you.
Uh...
No...
Oh, God, sweetie... Oh, no!
Oh, God, come on.
Come on.
Hello?
Glenn.
Hi. Um...
I was calling because...
Because...
I'm gonna get to the leaves.
Those leaves on the lawn.
Uh-huh.
You've said
that before, Susan.
Yeah.
But now, I'm on it.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Breathe, Mom.
Obviously, if you're listening to this,
I'm not around anymore.
I'd hoped to do it all myself,
but that's not an option now.
I hope you're not mad
at me for sneaking out.
But, I had to make sure that
everything was taken care of.
I know you rely on me, Mom.
Now I have to rely on you.
I need your help.
Everything you
need is right here.
It can't be left undone.
We have to make it better.
And Mom...
Yeah?
I'll be with you
the whole time.
Okay.
Okay.
We're gonna
walk through it together, step by step.
One little miscalculation,
and the whole thing fails.
Let's start by stockpiling
some cash from ATMs.
Don't act all weird.
The camera's behind that
little glass square up top.
Don't look.
Good.
Withdraw $500.
How's that enough?
I know it doesn't
seem like enough,
but if you hit
another ATM right away,
you can get
around the daily limit.
The next ATM's at
Longbow and Swan.
You're gonna go right
at the intersection.
Your other right.
Listen, I'm sure you
have doubts about this.
You think? It's goddamn
insane is what it is, Henry.
Good. Get all your swearing out,
not in front of Peter.
- It's a bad influence.
- It's a bad influence.
Park across the street
behind the green dumpster.
You came here?
Jesus.
I'm the worst parent
ever.
Remember the security camera's
field of vision.
It's in the diagram.
Mom...
You got this.
I need a Nemesis Vanquish 7.62
with a Litton Ranger
Night Vision scope,
a suppressor, and three extra
10-round detachable mags.
Think you can handle that or should
I take my business elsewhere?
Suppressors are
illegal for civilian use.
Let's see what Domenic has
to say about that, huh?
Yeah. Domenic.
Look, chief,
all due respect,
I got a plane to catch,
so why don't you just name your price,
and I'll get out of your hair?
Plywood is only slightly
thicker than the human skull.
And these rounds
fragment on impact,
making them pretty
much untraceable.
Slow, steady
pressure on the trigger.
You see that?
Good job, Mom.
You're getting there.
At first, I couldn't
imagine doing this,
but then I see
that look in her eyes,
like she's still in there.
Barely hanging on.
Nice shot, Mom.
Look at that grouping.
Now make sure you collect the
shells before you get out...
Need anything?
I'm good.
Well, don't burn anything down.
Remember that electrical fire.
Waffle irons are tricky.
Hey, Glenn.
Hey, Susan.
I'm sorry I haven't, uh...
Oh, no, don't, uh...
Um...
About your son, I, um...
Yeah, thanks.
Look, I was, uh... I was
hoping to get your advice
on something that
I'm trying to deal with.
Oh.
Do you mind?
Hey, sweetie.
How are you?
How's school?
Fine.
Except math.
It'll get easier. Soon.
Susan?
Uh, yeah, so, with everything that's
been going on this last month,
I, uh...
Well, it's got me thinking,
if God forbid something
were to happen to me,
being a single parent,
I want to have arrangements
made for where Peter would go.
Do you have anything
like that set up?
Well, I'm...
I'm pretty healthy.
I try to stay fit, um...
Guess there's always
the proverbial bus.
But, um...
No, I...
I've never really given it
much thought, you know?
Even after Christina's
mother passed away?
Nope.
Can't offer
much, um,
on that front.
Uh, why?
Just, you know,
your line of work.
You guys seem to have
all your ducks in a row.
Yeah. I'm sorry,
I can't be much help.
Mmm.
What's that?
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot...
I, uh, need you to sign off
on the talent show night
if I'm gonna take Christina.
You know how Cavalry
Elementary loves their forms.
Yeah.
Okay.
Great.
So, I'll pick her up tomorrow.
Okay.
Around 6:00?
Yeah.
Witnesses are required
for guardianship papers.
So, I backdated them
and forged
Miss Schwartz from up the block's
signature, since she died last year.
Mmm. Poor Mrs. Schwartz
from up the block.
Also,
I bought a new car for you.
There's nothing
wrong with the old car.
I know, I know.
But it's safer, and it'll make a
less conspicuous getaway car.
You just need to pick it up.
The address is in my notebook.
Fine.
Mom?
Oh, hey, honey.
What are you doing?
I was just, uh, finishing
up on some work here.
Okay... Let's
get you back to bed.
You ready for tomorrow?
The big talent show?
Kind of.
What are you gonna do?
A magic trick.
A magic trick.
Wow.
What's it gonna be?
It's a surprise.
Sounds exciting.
What if it doesn't work?
Well, you prepared
for it, right?
Yeah. A lot.
Mrs. Ramirez even
let me use the art lab.
Well, then you
shouldn't be nervous.
You've laid down
the groundwork,
and when it comes
to the time,
you'll just have to trust
it'll all go smoothly.
If Henry did it, there'd
be nothing to worry about.
It'd be perfect.
Baby...
What? Tell me.
Sometimes I think it
should have been me.
No.
How can you say that?
People would be
less sad, then.
Listen to me.
If anything
happened to you...
I...
I don't know what I'd do.
Henry was amazing...
But you...
You're just as special.
And the fact that you think
you're any less important to me,
isn't just wrong, it's...
It's stupendously wrong.
Okay?
Everything has to
be timed to the second.
Every movement, every
angle, every footstep.
There's no room for error.
This never happened.
You were never here.
Not even here now.
You're a ghost.
Like you.
Peter!
Come on, let's move it!
It's your big night!
Hey...
You're gonna play it cool
up there on stage, right?
And there's no need to panic, 'cause
panic never got anyone anywhere.
Just stay focused, stay calm,
and remember your
Lamaze breathing.
Good?
Okay.
Don't be nervous.
It's gonna be great.
Peter, what are you doing?
Why would you do that?
Henry would've
thought it was funny.
Henry was 11.
He was a genius.
But he wasn't a parent.
Okay?
Come on.
Hey.
Hi, uh...
Hi, I, um...
There you are,
all surprising-like.
I invited him. I wanted
him to see my trick.
Oh, I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.
Uh...
I hope, uh...
Is this okay?
Yeah, sure. No problem.
But, um...
I have to be
a parent volunteer tonight.
So, um, I'll have
parent volunteer things.
Okay.
Uh...
I'll just, um...
You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah? You look great.
Don't be nervous.
I won't.
I'll be watching you.
Peter?
Peter.
Good evening, parents.
The students are ready.
I am so proud of these kids.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Cavalry
Elementary School Talent Show!
You gonna step to me?
I kick you in the knees
I'm the baddest, meanest mad dog
mother you're ever gonna see
Blink twice, you miss me
Chicks, they try to kiss me
Suckers,
they see me and flee me
After I kick 'em in the
shorts, get lost dorks
'Cause you're all tidbits
But me, I'm the shiznits
Okay, Mom, this is it.
On my three.
One, two...
Three.
C-A-V-A...
R-Y!
Don't panic.
No matter what, don't panic.
I'm not panicking.
This is for my sister.
A.
B.
C.
D.
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch
Like me
I once was lost
But now I'm found
Time check.
37. 12.
Line your body up with
the rifle to reduce recoil.
Wait till he's exactly
where you need him.
Eliminate all distractions.
Shit.
Even trigger pressure.
Remember your training.
Smooth exhale.
Don't tense up.
Steady, Mom.
Steady...
Mom, take the shot.
Do it! Now!
No.
No.
You're just a child.
What the hell
is going on here?
I know what you've done.
Emergency room visits,
school absences,
bruises,
calls to
Child Protective Services
that all just got swept under
the rug by your brother.
Henry documented all of it.
And you never even
knew he was watching.
Who you think
they're gonna believe?
I don't know, Glenn.
I can afford a scandal.
How about you?
I'm gonna call my chief,
have him bring you in.
Whatever happens to me
won't change what you are.
I will go to the FBI.
I will go
to the newspapers.
I will make sure that you never lay
a hand on that little girl again.
And I will make you answer
for what you've done.
Look at me.
Look at me!
I want you to see who
you're up against now.
That can't be right.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Stan.
Hey.
It's Glenn.
Um...
Listen, I need you
to handle something for me.
Um...
You're gonna hear some
insane, uh,
accusations, you know, so...
I know, Glenn.
We got a call.
What do you mean?
A call?
From who?
The school principal.
We heard from the district.
It's too wide, Glenn.
We're gonna have
to open up a case.
And now,
introducing Peter the Great.
For my magic trick
I'm going to make
my brother reappear.
When I'm done, he's gonna be
here, right among all of us.
Please work.
You know, as a scientist,
I never believed in magic.
But after that, well...
Peter the Great.
Dr. Daniels.
Um...
Will I see you soon?
I hope so.
Uh...
Do you mind
watching him for a second?
Of course not.
I'll be right back, sweetie.
What happened?
Glenn Sickleman
took his life tonight.
Oh, my God.
The social worker asked to see
Christina alone for a moment.
Oh, sweetie...
In the best interest
of the minor child,
the court hereby orders that
permanent custody be awarded
to Susan Carpenter,
effective immediately.
Sometimes a good
story will remind you
of who you want to be.
Maybe that's why
there are so many.
Stories about good and evil,
stories about the triumph
of the human spirit,
stories about
living and dying,
and how you got to do one
in spite of the other.
Well, this story,
it's about you and
me and my brother,
and the girl who
lived next door.
But it's not
my story anymore.
It's yours.
"One by one, its petals
dropped to the ground,
"and then the leaves, and then
the bud, and then the stalk,
"until it seemed
the flower was gone.
"But it wasn't...
"Because the flower
melted into the soil
"and made it rich so the
whole garden could grow.
"The end."
I loved it.
I loved it, too.
Thank you.
Okay, let's get you into bed.
You're okay?
I'm almost finished
painting your room.
It'll be awesome.
Good night,
enchilada number one.
Good night, butterfly.
On or off?
On.
On.
Open or closed?
Closed.
Closed.
