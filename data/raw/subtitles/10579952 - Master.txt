Mother?
Appa...!
'Let's kill this boy also brother-in-law
If we burn all the evidence
we will be the prime suspects
'We need a witness
to speak in our favor'
All that is fine
Just like his father what if he also
makes trouble insisting on being truthful?
Let's find out right away
Hey boy What's your name?
- Bhavani - Huh?
Bhavani
How did your parents die?
They were burnt to death
in a gas explosion
[loud laughter]
He sure knows to survive I say
After we use him as a witness
...let us complain against him
for stealing our union funds
'His father is Lorry Union leader'
If we claim his son stole union cash
will anyone believe that story?
Sudden show of mercy huh?
He's so young that's why
Hey boy listen
I'll send you to a place where boys
like you are well looked after
Will you go there?
'Govt Juvenile Observation Home
Warangal'
'That boy shouldn't sleep
for even one night in peace'
I've given you more than
what you asked
Thank you brother
If there's any kind of foul play
brother-in-law will kill you
- Keep an eye
- I'll take care bro
'Hey! get up'...get up...
What are you looking at? Wipe it
Wipe my boots
I'll kill you rascal
'All of you go out'
Stinking scumbag!
I'm thrashing you
You're standing without any reaction!
You are hitting me
because someone is paying you
I have to pay you more than him
to prevent you from hitting me
I am penniless
Hit me as much as you want
When I have the money
I'll call you then
- Who is this?
- 'Brother'
'That boy Bhavani has
escaped from jail'
Scumbag! Is this why
I'm spending so lavishly?
I'll deal with this in the morning
Find him before daybreak
I won't harm you
'Don't worry brother'
'If I had wanted to kill you, I would have
easily slit your neck when you were asleep'
But I can't be smitten with fright
and hide throughout my life
I came here to request you
to spare me.
I don't understand
Let me live brother
What do I gain by releasing you huh?
Leave me alone for only this week
I'll give you half of
what I earn this week
'Whichever week I don't pay you'
...stab me on that same day
at that same spot
You say so? Okay go
This week is yours go
How much do they pay to cross the
check post without a permit bro?
Without giving Rs 1000 per lorry
you won't be allowed to pass
I'll give the permit
Keep the 1000 rupees
I want Rs 100 per lorry
If the policemen hassle us?
I will take care of that
What man? What do you want?
'2002-2003 Register'
Go... go
Go... go
If anyone wants permit, they must
give me 500 Rupees per lorry
Got it?
'Catch'
Whether I'm here or not
...ensure that the boys get
their share of booze and fag
'Govt Reformatory'
In a way we are the
cause of all this brother
When we killed his father
we should have killed him too
Now he has the gall to contest as head
in the Lorry Drivers' Union Election
How did he amass
this much wealth bro?
Nagu do you know how many
lorries he has under his control?
Not only that, he owns a meat factory
He is into exports too
All this is common news partner
He does something with the boys in
reformatory for juvenile delinquents
That's why, a lot of money flows in
Some even say he plays
proxy to a minister
If only he wins in this
year's Union election
...he will stoop to any level
to avenge his father's murder
We shouldn't spare him
anymore partner
He's coming on his own
Finish him here.
Hey bro!
You are sporting all the medals of
Hindu Muslim and Christian Gods?
If you pray to all the Gods, one or
the other will save you in danger.
Minimum guarantee?
Proverbs?
Is this the same chap who pleaded
when he was 17 to spare his life?
We need to discuss something
important with you
You've been paying us
on a weekly basis all these years
Drop it
Instead you can sell all your assets
'Go, make a living somewhere else'
I wanted to tell you
exactly this at the earliest
Week after week, all these days
I was paying you to save my life
That's why I've decided
to stop payment
That decision isn't yours to take
'Just zip your lips
and obey our orders'
I will do only what I feel is right
Hey... Hey... Hey...
I know what all you are doing....
Making those boys surrender
for the crimes you commit
'Instigating them to kill
We know about all your offenses'
Don't show off your temerity or
else I will build your grave right here
Turn your head and look around.
This is my joint, if I think something...
Only the lorry will leave from here.
You won't
You don't know the difference between
slogging for money or gratitude.
O ho...
You want me to show you a sample?
Brothers! There is an important here.
Come over!
Come on
It's Bhavani
This gift of money is for anyone
who kills these 3 big men right here
2 million
[burst of amused laughter]
Whom do you think you are talking to?
Do you think brother is for money?
You know how many years I'm with him
3 million
If you give 3 million?
He is our brother!
4 million
Why are you keeping quiet
when he's so arrogant bro?
You just say one word, I'll kill...
5 million!
- How dare you rattle off?
- 6 million
Hey! Kill him now
Wait... let us hear our brother out!!
7 million
Wait... wait bro
I'll go up to the gate and make sure
no one enters this area
8 million
8 million? Move aside
Then shall we lock
the deal for 8 million?
We'll split 8 million equally
I'll deal with these three
We will take care of their case brother
Have you now understood the
difference between money and gratitude?
Forget all this.
I'll give you 2 minutes
Kill me if you can
And save yourself
Hey!
These boys?
Yes sir
Post mortem matches the crime scene?
They have done a neat job sir
Not knowing to drive
they ran over a man
Who? Them?
'Hey! For whom are you surrendering?
Sir I'm not a professional driver
I thought I'll try my hand
But turned out fatal
- Right?
- Yes
- 'Do they have a past history?'
- Yes sir
Pickpocket case 511
Then 6 months they were in
a juvenile delinquent reformatory
Now they are in IPC 302
Is this observation home?
Or a criminal training center?
Why do you need this reformatory
that turns a thief into a murderer?
- Call the Observation home staff
- Okay sir
Sir he's calling you
Good afternoon sir
I am the superintendent here
Forget the introduction when do you
intend employing a regular master?
The boys drive away
any master we appoint
Actually scared of them
no master wants to take up this post
But how without a master?
'Not one master so far huh?'
How shameful?
If there's no master to teach
or guide the students
'...how will they reform huh?'
'I have personally seen
30-40 cases like this here'
'Superintendent I'm passing
a Govt order'
'Send it to all private Govt schools
and colleges to every single institution'
Can't we find at least one master!
Understood?
Type out the order
"They call me master
Decisions are faster"
"Unlimited power...
Who is the master?"
A very renowned college.
Those who have studied in this college
'In cinema politics advertising and
business in their own might'
This college has molded
innumerable VIPs
'Students are very eager to make this
a very memorable reunion'
Do you want to know why?
Come along with me
Hi... Yes Ramya
- Hi nice to meet you
- Same here
I've spoken to you over the phone
- Oh! That was you?
- Yeah
What's your full name?
Charulatha Pooserla
Nice. Come let me
introduce you to everyone
- This college has a decorum
- Students are capable of doing it
Their plan is to ruin our image when
the minister arrives as our chief guest
'If this issue leaks
your college reputation is at stake'
Sit down. If you want
to take further action
Do so after the minister leaves
In this cat and mouse game,
explain things as they happened.
- Better confess truth, it's JD, right?
- Trust me sir
So? Who is that? Your father?
Sir, You all know
what happened to Savitha.
What shall we do with the two rascals
who sexually harassed her?
Hey! Hey! Mind your words!
Spit the gum first
I say, throw it out
Sir, the sweetness isnt gone yet.
I will spit it on the way out.
I said throw it out
Sir, you suspended for one week
two guys who sexually harassed her
Because that wasn't enough,
we gave a police complaint
These people made us run around
without taking any action.
Why? Just because Adi's father
is a big business man
They are planning to send
them to Canada.
I took my people to their house
to demand justice
Hello sir.
They have not left home
Looks like they are still inside
but planned something perfectly.
New people are visiting
the place frequently.
Watch out! They seem to
be coming out. Be careful.
Don't be scared. I will take care.
I can hear their voices
I think they are coming out. Okay?
Go! Go! Hurry up. Be quick!
Sir, they have started from home.
They seem to be heading
for the airport.
I'm following them sir
Where are you?
- Nagar - Which signal?
Punjagutta
Bus number? Bus number?
Which bus? Which bus? 10!
Why? Why? 10! 10! Its coming!
Look here! Here! Brother!
Over here! Come soon. That bus.
Get in... get in... go inside
Sir, they are going in 10 Y bus.
Bus number TS 01 AN 1184
Bus has just crossed Punjagutta signal
Why did he cut the call?
"Got a man with a plan right here.
Bringin' swag with the man right here."
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"
"Yeah clap for me man right here"
"Got the man with the plan right here"
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"
"Yeah clap for me man right here"
"Hey! No matter what they say"

"Master the blaster"
"Hey! No matter what they do"
"Mr Master the Blaster"
"Got the man with the plan right here"
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"
"Yeah clap for me man right here"
"Got the man with the plan right here"
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"
"Yeah clap for me man right here"
"Sound the alarm"
"Yeah! Give it up for my man JD
settin' fire to the screen"
Don't be frightened bro
I've informed our boys
Our men are inside the airport
Don't worry at all
All loopholes covered
"with limitless power, who's the Master?'
"Thalapathy"
Come let's go
Not you
Come
Hey!
Throw him out
Who is that?
Professor
'Bro get up Come... come'
Hurry up
'Hey driver don't stop the bus'
Go... go... keep going
'Don't stop keep moving'
[amused chuckle]
'Stop... stop'
'Stop man'
'Let's get off Come soon'
'They got down from the bus and ran'
Thank god he came in his bike
- It wasn't him
- Sorry sir he came
Sir climb on
'In all this confusion
they ran into the Metro station'
Give me the token
Come fast
'Get in quick'
Looks cool eh?
I never got a chance to take a Metro train
from when it started operating
Thanks boys
Hey...!
I plan to stab a master here
Brave hearts continue the ride
Fainthearted alight
Girls... girls
I'll collect it later
'If you move a bit
I can go there and watch'
'Thanks sir'
(smug chuckle)
How are college students and
'dhoti' clad politicians connected?
Airport is close by
Catch an auto or something and go
Don't wait here Hurry up
They rushed out and
got into a share auto
'Turned out to be our friend
Jameel anna's auto I got in too'
'Easy-peasy that's where they got caught'
- Escape to Canada right?
- Yes sir
'Friends encircled and took them
to the police station right?'
Yes sir
So you were responsible
for everything
- Yes sir
- JD had nothing to do with this?
We swear nothing at all sir
'Sir'
Those 2 boys swear
your teacher JD was behind this
- These students are lying
- Of course I know sir
JD is the culprit
- Who is JD? Umm... I will tell you.
Sir, Minister has come inside
If you are ready we can
escort him to the auditorium
Come... come
Sir you please sit
- I'll be back in 10 minutes
- I'll wait
- Serve him tea - Carry on
2 minutes sir I'll be right back
Not picking your call huh?
It's ringing but he isn't picking
He's same-same as
student and master huh?
Shut up da
Vanitha didn't you try?
- I asked the students
He's suspended it seems
If you had told us earlier we could
have gone in person and brought him
He must be very busy try again
"Got the man with the plan right here"
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"
"Yeah clap for me man right here"
Uncle he's our Principal
Premdas Samuel
'Ramya?'
If that student is such a troublemaker
...why not just dismiss him?
Then he should have
got dismissed 20 years ago!
What are you saying?
JD isn't a student my dear
Professor!
- Whaaat?
- Dean of student affairs
'First of all
we welcome you all'
'Good morning one and all present here'
'Our honorable chief guest
beloved Minister R.Gautham'
'Respected dignitaries on the dais'
'What-?'
We-
[loud cheering]
Sir students are refusing
to come from the back stage
I believe you said this function
won't go on without JD huh?
Then what sir? We kept
telling you he is not to blame
'You've suspended him for 2 weeks'
Any other day it's fine sir
This alumni meet is only for him
How can he not be present?
Nothing will happen here without him
Are you their leader?
I see
Just you wait!
Sir the minister has been
waiting for a long time
- Please bear with us
- He canceled so many appointments
- Start the program
- I'll talk to them and join you
Om Shanti! Om Shanti!
Peace in speech and spirit
- Call JD
- You suspended him and asking me to call?
- You call him
- I don't know his number
Call him dude
Call before he changes his mind
[humming a song]
"Hey Ramulo... Ramula...
she got me worried"
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"
Hello... huh... JD
This is Principal... Samuel here
JD sir is fast asleep
Call later
Principal Premadas Samuel
Prema! Your name can mean love but
he won't get up to hear your loving words
- Guzzled 3 or 4 bottles of booze
- 'Can you wake him up or not?'
Huh...? No chance dear
Hey!
He's drunk
What can I do?
Will you ask your Education Minister
to wait for half an hour?
We'll go and get him
- Whaat?
- Do it
- What happened?
Is this how you drum-roll?
Getting paid right? Bump it
Rock and roll man
This is it This is what we want
Ready ya Come on ya
"Master is coming move aside"
Hey stop... stop
Lift him
Heave-ho!
Speed up!
Sir good morning
Your tea sir
"When brother enters,
it's power of atom bomb..."
- Did they really invite me?
- Sir why this doubt?
'I swear they asked you to come'
Bro beat the drum
"Master coming!"
"Move aside!"
"Rock and roll!"
"Deliberately if you make trouble"
"It will boomerang on you centuple"
"If you jeer or sneer at us"
"Mind you you'll be limbless"
'Zazzorific!'
Aiyo!
"Stand in line... stand in line"
"Rock and roll Heart and soul"
"Brother... start it... start it"
"Move aside"
Aiyo!
"When brother enters,
it's power of atom bomb..."
"Brother... start it... start it"
"Master coming!"
Got tired sir?
- Where is the ID card?
- I have it sir
- First wear it and go inside
- Done
"Master coming!"
'JD'
Start the program
Sir 1 minute Let me speak
Sir-
Give this to JD sir
'I've attended
many college functions'
- Wear your ID card
- 'Witnessed many gatherings'
'But I've never seen a crowd like this'
Because the entire crowd here
More than the anchor of the show
'They are celebrating
the man seated there'
'It is no mean achievement'
'If he is getting this kind of
overwhelming reception among students'
'Then he must be a dedicated
and focused professor'
'If he himself is like this...'
'Imagine students supervised by him'
'Must be very disciplined'
'First give this man
a big round of applause'
To get a professor like him
You and your college
must be truly blessed
Your eyes are red
Wear this shade
'This most revered master'
'I would like him to come up
to the dais and say a few words'
'I am calling you sir'
Please come
Come up and speak
Hey...! Where are you going?
Wait let me tell a mini story
Did you look at your shoes?
Instead of being humiliated sit down
If you get up once more-
Please take your seat
JD is our-
Management and staff
are completely against JD
But students celebrate him
I don't get this
He has gone out of his way
for students' welfare
Students revere him as their true hero
So the management
took a strong dislike
Secondly after 6:00 p.m
our hero will be totally sloshed!
- Good morning sir
- Good morning
Careful sir
- Sorry... sorry
- 'Then what happened?'
Muralidhar is ogling a lot
- Hi... hi
Your classroom is at that end
Good morning
'What is his flash back sob story
to get sloshed every day?'
Don't ask him that alone
If he gets a gullible idiot he'll reel
off with whatever comes to his mouth
After that I took her home.
We fell in love
Just when I got the passport ready
to send her, the villain came.
Did you get caught? Wait sister.
Villain's name is
Mr. Obul Reddy.
We belonged to the same quarters.
I was in 8G She was in 7G
India is here
America is right here
I picked my guitar and started off
My darling she is
My lucky stars!
We loved each other in that birth.
I got the strength to beat up
even 500 people.
But we fell from the
mountain and died.
Ah! That's why I'm searching
for that girl in this birth.
Take your hands off me sir!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Too much filmy imagination
Okay which department is he in?
He studied in this same college
He finished M.Phil Psychology here
'Now he teaches
Personality Development'
May I request you all
to please stand up?
I said... stand... up
Now I intend checking
if your mind and body are focused
We are hearing
But not listening
Students don't listen to their teachers
Teachers don't listen to their students
Now
RUN
Run... run... run
WATER!
Electricity...!
Children don't listen to their parents
Parents don't listen to their children
And finally
And... don't listen to their people
Whatever I tell you now
repeat it verbatim
But
Do just the opposite
Jump in
Jump left
Jump right Rei... rei...!
Now on the starboard
Faster... faster... faster
Now close your bloody eyes
and freeze
Class disperse
Getting late for my class
- We'll meet at lunch
- Okay sure
'Let me repeat this'
That bloody Bhavani is
responsible for all this
He finished off his opponents contesting
in our Union election one by one
I know his history A to Z
Gurumurthy brother whether these people
understand it or not hope you do
I have been saying this
right from the beginning
Who endorsed my view?
With the help of juveniles
he is into all criminal activities
Why are you siting quiet? Speak up!
We know this already
Greetings brother
What's it?
Are you such a big shot huh?
If you kill him will you get his post?
- Let me see - No bro
Why are you so mad at me?
I'm like a brother to you
Whatever it is
let's talk it over
Any need for me to talk to you?
I'll close your chapter!
Get the car ready
Bro will a problem
be solved if we fight?
Will murder solve the problem?
Let's discuss it amicably
I'll use the same juvenile delinquents
you use as tool to finish you off!
Want to wait and watch?
I'm like one of them
You watched me grow
- Wait bro
- You peed in your pants looking at me
You think you're my equal now?
Whatever it is let's talk it over
I am much younger than you
But pay heed to my words
Don't go brother
'Oh my God!'
Going... Gone brother?
So sad
You saw it, right?
What did I do?
If I had walked out talking to him
I would've shared his fate
Impossible for a human
to time this so perfectly
I pray to all Gods thrice daily
So God has saved me
and punished him
'May his soul rest in peace!'
To conduct Students' election
in our college this year
University Grants Commission has granted
permission but I opposed it strictly
But, for a mere formality
I need all your opinions
Why we don't want this election
For the records
I somehow feel it is unnecessary sir
'Semester is coming soon
'In the current scenario
why do we need an election?'
Yeah... you're right
'Sir if this is happening
some other issues will create'
- I don't think they are fit for elections
- Correct
'In my honest opinion no'
'I have no issues with
the day college students'
'I am a little apprehensive
about the evening batch'
Thanks Ramya
Charulatha your opinion?
Sorry sir, it's only been 2 days
since I joined sir
So if I voice my opinion
I don't know if it will be right
Come on what's there?
- No sir - Hey!
- Why is JD sir keeping quiet?
- That's right?
'I think election conduction
is a not good idea'
Sir to be on the safe side
ask JD his opinion
'JD tell us your opinion'
What is your opinion JD?
- What day was today?
- Thursday
Thursday is his day off bro
- 'Professor JD'
- He would have been piss drunk
- Come... come - Hey! Careful
JD...?
SIR!
Emergency sir emergency
What are you doing here?
Let me give this phone to Rosie madam
Its emergency
Her husband fell off his bike
When he climb the vehicle
A call came sir
I'm telling you
I'll suspend you
- Give me phone, I'll go away sir
Abdul, what happened? Tell me
- 'Wake up sir'
Phone is switch off
that's why they call me
Leave
- Poor husband - Hello
They are objecting to elections
Tell them something sir
- Sorry sir - Get out
- Useless fellow!
- Thank you sir
JD what is your opinion
about conducting elections?
Election is essential that's all
- I thought as much
- 'He will say something meaningless sir'
If we announce a students' election
all of them will be working of only that
Not one of them will study
nor will anyone attend any class
Correct, what will they learn
by conducting students' election?
Why politics in college?
Matthew sir
What is 'politics' sir?
Sir I don't wish to talk to you
Is that so? But I wish to speak
I'm coming
Sir
First a student should know
'politics' means service
Only if our students learn about election
canvassing leadership in college
...they will have an awareness about
state central elections for the future
College students are
our first time voters
Only if students are allowed to think
A new leader will emerge
for the next generation
To mould as a good leader
or to choose the right leader
...they will acquire maturity
For someone to-
They will stick posters all over
and spoil the walls with graffiti
Then claim ownership
over the walls and fight
Doesn't all this happen
in normal elections outside?
Sit down sir
Aren't these normal issues
that crop up in general elections?
So can we decide to
abolish elections in our country?
We have grown up with this culture of
poster banner fanfare still follow it
If students should know
the do's and don'ts of poster etc
...we must conduct
elections in college
Only then he will be
a good example outside
'If our culture of bribing with 'biriyani'
booze and big bucks should change'
...students should know
the ins and outs of politics
Okay
Let's assume what you're
saying is right
Who is responsible if students resort
to violence or damage college property?
Sir nothing of that sort will happen
If something happen
will you leave this college?
Will you resign huh?
We'll see if it happens
Then you be the presiding officer
And conduct this election
If any problem crops up
Give a letter
you will leave this college
Coming June 25th
Students' elections
[loud cheering]
I haven't seen him conduct
an election as a master
'But I've seen him
do the same as a student'
Shake your hands
This is the wall of democracy
Your rules and regulations
'Gym facilities free for all students'
'Non veg will be served
for all in the hostel'
'Good orators have become able leaders'
You should speak up more boldly Savi
'Instead of finding faults
with your rival and campaigning'
'...ask for votes
listing your reforms'
Tear every single poster dude
Posters and banners should be stuck
or erected in their allocated places
'Even if there's a small brawl
among the students'
'...election will be canceled'
You pull back and fire
Cheers! - Sir!
'Our total strength is 5500 students sir'
We have divided them
into 10 categories
What is this column?
That is religion and caste category
Let's avoid that
Only if we delete it here
It won't follow us in our life
Hey! How much longer do you intend
drinking and roaming around?
Why yell at me for no reason?
Will I yell at you
if you are steady on your feet?
- I am steady - Shall we see?
Hit an arrow
anywhere on this board
I'll agree you are
sober and steady
Bro, strike on the dot!
Here's department wise
Cheers!
'I've been given so many person
experience in counseling'
If you can tell me the reason
I can do my level best to help you
Since my childhood,
I've been very fond of my aunt.
Rejecting her grandpa,
she got married and went off
- Oh!
To console the grandpa,
I went in search of my aunt
Without revealing about myself,
I went to work at her house as a driver.
My aunt has a lovely daughter.
Myself and the girl fell in love
without the knowledge of others
Actually, to tell my aunt
who I am and why I came...
I asked for the entire
railway station to be vacated.
Ah... vacated the railway station?
'Tomorrow if you have a problem
'Even if it's midnight
I'll be there for you'
Why should we create problems
and end up in the police station?
Beverages free in the canteen
Aqua training access free
You will have campus interviews
You'll leave the college with a job in hand
Above all give this serious thought
Do you want to be ruled by a girl?
Or revel in a boy's leadership?
Hey! That isn't even my glass
Some other chap has relished
a drink and gone madcaps!
Bloody
Sir...?
'Fourth round sir'
They'll announce final result
I'm scared sir
Isn't Arjun Prasad a big leader?
4th round it seems
Get lost!
'Most awaiting election results
are going to be announce very soon'
'What is happening over there?'
going to be declared - Wait
Bhargav 2588 votes
'Savitha 2648 votes'
'Savitha won the election by 60 votes'
[loud cheering]
Congrats chairperson
We will face everything
Sir I think they have already
started creating a ruckus there
Sir what do we do now?
Why do you still ask me?
Ask her
Chairman tell us what to do?
Ah...'Sir'
To avoid unnecessary confusion
I'm thinking of talking to Bhargav directly
It's good
Go happily
But go alone
Madam
Don't dilly-dally scratch your head
crack your knuckles and keep looking back
Don't dawdle and
do 'installment' walk
Forward march!
Sir will you give me your bracelet?
Why?
Please give sir
There is a Botany lecture and a matinee
picture. Which would you vote for
There's a history lecture and a
mystery picture. Brother which is best?
Botany class is a big bore.
History lecture is...
I want to talk to you
If she comes offering a truce
I'll break the bones on her face
- Bro tell me - 'What happened?'
Our son lost bro
What?
Bhargav... Ah....
I came to congratulate
Winning by just 60 votes
is no big victory at all
Ah... is there any rule in college
there should be only 1 chairman?
You take over day college
and I'll handle evening college
Okay bye
Congrats
I extended my hand
even on nomination day
You didn't want to shake hands
At least let it be truce now?
I don't think it's safe
for her to go alone
Shall I go and check sir?
Hmmm... let's shake hands
- Okay - How ridiculous bro?
You compromise with her
'He is shaking hands
with that girl who won'
'Let me talk to him'
1 minute bro
'Babu'
Dad there's no problem
I spoke to that girl
She even asked me to be
the chairman for Day college
'You got a sudden desire to
beg a post from her huh?'
It isn't what you think
I'll come in person and explain you
- Bro
- 'Pack him home safely from there'
Okay bro
'If he refuses to go threaten him'
- Okay bro
- 'Rough up that girl who defeated him'
- I'll handle it
I'll explain to my dad
Please don't create a ruckus
He has given me permission
to scar even your face bro
First get inside
But please don't hurt that girl
Sir he wasn't nasty to me
I shook hands and he said okay
That's all
Celebrations are done
Hey! Catch
Give it to all
- Where's the booth?
Clear up all this mess
Sir evening college students are
planning to burn down the booth
- Who is he?
- Professor bro
- What?
- That wasn't a proper election
- We demand re-election or re-counting
- Election is over that's all
- Burn down the booth
- Which department are you?
- Come here
- Stop this bloody idle talk
I'll kill you son of a gun
I'll break all your teeth!
Please be quiet!
- Sir let go
- 'Shut up all of you'
I'm talking with them
Evening college chairman candidate
Bhargav wants to talk to you sir
'My dad didn't listen to me'
He has sent 50-60 Party riff-raffs
to bash up everyone in college
'They have merged with the students
Ensure our college students are safe sir'
On the starboard!
- 'Why are all of them spinning?
- What are they doing?'
Now close your bloody eyes and freeze
'What are you doing?
Tell us bro'
'Sticking to the wall like glue?'
Move forward
'They are doing just the opposite'
'Wait don't go'
Send all the girls home safe
- Sir?
- Just do as I say
Take all of them through the back door
Go... go... fast
'Bloody! Bash him up'
'Hey, stop'
Grab her... Catch her!
Hey!
Go! Go! Go!
The students are uncontrollable
Leave me...
- Take your hands off
How dare you beat a girl?
Its not a big wound sir.
Just a nail's scratch
Hey, The meeting is happening
in the library.
Is everyone safe?
'I have checked all the groups'
They have texted me
The entire riot has been recorded
in our college CCTV cameras
Is he behaving like a professor?
Excuse me ma'am you are
talking about damage of property
Rowdies got together and
bashed up 4-5 of our girls
What could all the teachers do?
- No one came to stop them
- Stop it Charu
It isn't even 1 month
since you joined this college
Just keep quiet
What the hell are they discussing?
I'll be back
I'll talk to JD
If he is coming back to the college,
we will all resign.
No,
Mr. Premadas. You cannot decide in haste.
Sir I have already given
a commitment I'll resign
I'm just leaving this college
JD just wait in the car
- 'I need to talk to you'
- Sir...?
I said 'wait'
'I understand'
If they need to know your worth
A gap is essential
Your decision is correct
You wanted a break for 3 months?
I have granted it
When did I ask?
Isn't this your signature?
Sir
Carbon copy sir
Oh! Come on JD
Didn't you ask for a break
of 3 months intending to teach?
Teach? In which college?
College?
As you have mentioned
Observation Home
Sir don't play the fool
What will I do there?
I didn't sign this
Maybe after 6:00 p.m?
After 6:00 p.m
Good chance
See
JD you're losing control
on yourself
If there's any issue in the election
didn't you agree to resign your job?
That means you have
something on your mind
Fine sir I'll go I'll go
Well... I have many 'well' wishers here
This must be their handiwork
It's okay I need a change too I'll go
'Inspector is waiting in your mansion
to explain job you'll be undertaking'
'That means'
What's it Yadhav?
You say you didn't
give this information?
No bro
Then how come police know about my fight
with the lawyer in the union office?
I don't know brother
This Anirudh who makes
songs for movies...
He has released a new song
Shall we hear that?
- Listen - 'Bro'
'Bhavani has fixed the date
You are his next target'
'He has decided to kill you too
What do you say bigamist?
At least is this your voice
or will you claim its mimicry?
- Bro - Did you call me Bhavani?
Make sure the boys are supplied
their regular dose of drinks and drugs
Whether they get
3 square meals a day or not
Booze and dope should flow steadily
Okay Bhavani I'll see to it
Where was I?
You got me married and how
can you make my wife a widow?
Tell me bro
Wait I'm choking with emotion
hearing your sentimental speech
Why are you jerking?
I had tucked the knife in my waist
What if it pierces me in wrong place?
- Not that
- Suppose an enemy kills us
Doesn't matter if they say
'that's how Bhavani died a noble death'
If they say 'he had tucked a knife
that stabbed him in a wrong spot'
Does that sound good?
- No - No right?
- Lean back comfortably
- Don't bro
- Is that a show of respect?
- Yes bro
How is it over the phone
all this 'bro' kinship is missing?
Don't brother. Lean back
Don't brother
Won't you comply with
your bro's death wish for you?
SIT BACK SIT BACK!
Hey Gopal!
- Hey - 'Yes bro'
Tell me bro
Ask Das to pick 2 boys
10-15 years old to surrender
- Okay bro - Go
Bro...? Huh?
A new master has been recruited
for our reformatory it seems
- Okay... so?
- I don't know if you know
They usually appoint
a master for the jail
All of you are giving a build up
as if it is Breaking News!
Dispose of this body and
ask someone to drive this truck
Okay bro
Sir can we switch off that cacophony!
- Then shall I wear my coolers?!
- Huh?
Sir college students are bound by
certain protocols of parents and society
But those boys there
lack all that discipline
Their age and their activities
have no connection whatsoever
'Not even a single inmate
is human
'Beasts'
Idiots
'They know our law is lenient
to their habitual crimes'
'They use it to their advantage
breaking laws as reckless criminals'
'That's why I'm telling you sir'
'Don't try to reform them
during those 3 months assigned to you
Aren't you wondering
whether to go there or not?
'Sir...?'
'Sir...!'
Ugh?
'Is brother sleeping?
Sir check if that's your phone?
Bro... bro
'Wake up bro'
Not mine
Oh! Brother's phone
That's no problem sir
I don't mind going
- I can handle them - Sir
So have you decided to go?
Das...?
That Master will be here tomorrow
Despite knowing about this place
...if he is ready to set foot here
Don't take him lightly
First let him land up
After he steps in here
Let's see if he lasts here
even for half an hour
You should be in there
by 10'o clock
If you freshen up
I can take you in my car
In that vehicle?
- 'Yes' - Okay you go
- If you come soon-
- I'll shower and come
Life is a pain hmmm?
90 days...
If he comes in goes to the board and
starts taking a lesson
...ask all of them
to fling these at him
Das
Bro Das
Doesn't look like a master
He and his beard...
No book or cane in hand
He looks so local
We'll provoke him and then pounce
Master! They call me master!
Master
"If you step foot in our place
it is trespassing into our space"
"We will hassle you to the root
Master change your route"
"As juveniles we roam
in this Observation Home"
If you ask us to study, we can't add up
Don't think of catching
our necks and scaring us
Hey! Don't catch our necks to scare...
Rocking song guys. Why did you stop?
Hey! Hey... Hey... Songs!
Wow! There seem to be
a lot of artistes here...
Are you setting out to play?
Why? Shouldn't we go?
I don't interfere in the likes
or dislikes of anyone boss
Whoever wants to play go ahead
Want to sit here be my guest
'I am allergic to the sun
I'll sit right here'
Should I teach now?
- No... no - We want to play
Very good
- 'I must catch up on Amazon Netflix'
- Shall we give the letter now brother?
'I hate the sight of
this classroom bench'
- 'I will throw all this out'
- Not now I'll tell you
Don't indulge in all this graffiti
on the board bathroom walls
You focus on your work
and I'll stick to my job
Deal?
We thought of chasing you away
if you started lessons today
You are unique master
He seems to be one of us
Turned out I'm quite jobless
Why waste time sitting?
Why is this place so dirty
and stinking to high heaven?
We celebrate 10 festivals a year
and some 20 birthdays of leaders
You don't clean up this place
and celebrate on any occasion?
'Celebrate' means?
That means-
Have a blast huh?
Right
Rock on
We have no idea of day or date
Quit talking
Not that. Some of you were singing
when I entered
- Who were they?
- We sang
What the four of you just sang
If 40 of you sing in chorus
That's celebration
Come with me I'll show you
Beat it
"Let me sing a 'Chitti' story
Pay attention listen to me"

Go... go... go....
Brother... Why is he sleeping?
Quick wake him up
Sir
Sir
Sir?
- Put the letter in his pocket
- He is sleeping bro
Just do it
Hey!
Who is that tickling me?
I can hear footsteps we'll talk
to him over the phone tonight
Come away
Come come come
Thank God only another 89 days left
Go home
Brother Brother Stop Brother
I noticed just now
Don't know who played this prank
Why are you riding a cycle?
I can drop you in my car
That's alright
I was hoping at least
you will bring about a change
Why? It's all going smooth
The boys are having fun
We are submerged in problems
Half the boys have
drug addiction problem.
Whatever they get
they readily use as weapons
Everyday some boy or the other
twists his arm or ankle
Why tell me all these sob stories?
Am I the police or what?
I'm just a teacher here
Sir you don't understand
The police will nab the criminals
Court will punish them
To guide these boys
To sift and sieve right from wrong
We are not equipped sir
They need a master like you
'What happened bro?'
'I tried 10-15 times
He isn't picking my call'
'Try again bro'
"Got the man with the plan right here"
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"
'He isn't picking our call'
Do you remember
Charu sister's number?
Try to call her again bro
'Hurry up'
Mani speaking akka
`You saw me in the Observation Home
- Someone is coming - 'Tell me'
Lets go. Stop....stop
Eat
Brother
- We don't want - Why?
Not hungry
Is that so?
You heard him right?
Half baked nutcase!
How much we have suffered
starving in this same spot moron
Get me some water
Bro I'm scared-
Lucky to get a leg piece
in a 'biriyani'
You can even kill someone
But not rob him of food
Go on eat
Water
Enough
They took my phone though
they knew very well it was mine
Whom did you call?
No one bro
No brother
Tell the truth. Whom did you call?
I don't know
Ma... master bro
Who?
The master who joined duty
- Master huh?
- He's a boozer bro
You don't have to take him
seriously at all bro
Why call the master?
My father died when I was a kid
Couldn't bear the hunger
I stole and got caught
They piled cases on me
And sent me to this
Ju... Juvenile Home bro
We are being released tomorrow
But he is asking me to surrender
for a murder case bro
If my mother gets to know this
she will die of shock bro
If you had called me
instead of calling that master
I'm emotional by nature you see
I would have assigned
someone else to surrender
Not wanting to surrender
isn't a mistake on your part
But you wanted to sneak
our internal information
Isn't that a grave mistake?
Grown-up boy you tell me
What you did was wrong or not?
- Yes it was wrong
- So I am right?
Enough of eating 'biriyani'
I'll take it You've had enough
Here take this
Aren't we both very young bro?
Think of us as your younger brother
and please forgive us this time
My dear only boys like you
should not be pardoned
They pardoned me
Look how it has shaped me
How do we deal with this?
We won't repeat this bro
We won't snitch to anyone
Listen you can be scared
of anyone in this world
But if death knocks at our door
...even if it is Lord Yama
you shouldn't be scared
I'll give you 2 minutes
Kill me and then save
your brother and yourself
What were you doing
when these kids stole your phone?
On top of it you have
this stuck up attitude!
- Go away - I won't leave you
Listen to me Just run away
- Run outside - Listen to me
Mess up all my orders
Only plus is your voice! Go
You have got another minute
Decide fast
Go away from here
I won't leave you alone
'What are you doing brother?'
This is what I expected from you!
Clear out
Brother!!!
Wake up bro Get up
I'm constable Rajalingam
Get up bro
School starts only at 8'o clock
Why are you waking me-
We have a problem on hand
Inspector wants to see you
Why should I meet the inspector?
You have to get up now
You don't realize the gravity of-
Okay I'll get up
Don't shake me up like a rattle!
Go I'll follow
'I will come'
Start... make it quick
[overlap of angry voices]
'Hey! Don't push
How many times to tell you?'
'Be quiet'
"Tender little hearts...
Will they cease to beat?"
"Whether here or in graveyard...
Life is same..."
'What are you gawking at huh?'
Yov! Who are you?
- Get out - Sir... sir
He is our class master
Oh! You are that master huh?
First I have to interrogate you
What did you do with the boys?
It never happened like this earlier
Did you hit any of the boys?
Tell me
Can't you hear me? Answer man
Sir what is this?
Not here I need to
take him for inquiry
'Get him into our police jeep'
- Okay sir
'Can't you hear me?'
If I say once isn't that enough?
- Move aside - Stand outside
"But wings never fluttered..."
"Is it world that won't melt hearts?"
Bhavani can we come with you?
He has asked me to come
by myself I can handle it
What about... that master
who is in police custody?
I came out of the
reformatory 15 years ago
Reason I've been patient
for the past 5 years
I wanted to kill these 3 men and
become the president of the Drivers' union
2 men are dead and gone
This is the last one to go down
He has sent for me
Is he my priority?
Or is this master important?
He's only important
- What shall we do with this master?
- I'll handle him
- Sure?
- No problem. We will take care
Shall I go now?
- We'll take care
Let's go
Come with me
Where are you going?
- 2 minutes sir
- Quick sir will be here anytime
'Are you the mother of
those 2 boys who died?'
- 'Yes sir - Is that so?'
'Give him all the details'
Boozed upto your brow huh?
- 'Sit outside - Okay sir'
If someone is calling you
10 times from the same number
...won't it occur to you
it may be a serious problem?
No Ch... Charu
Why are you staring so blankly?
I was a volunteer in an NGO
before I took up this post here
Based on a complaint I went
for inspection to that Observation Home
That's how I befriended those 2 boys
They told me about the injustice
in that reformatory
But I couldn't take
any legal action
So many vile threats
The only reason I shifted to city
was to handle such cases myself
I needed to be financially secure
So I took up this lecturer's post
When you defended the students
my faith was recharged
I was convinced this flawed system
could be changed for the better
I forged your signature
for this post
Even for your job
I was the one who applied
Even the founder is aware of this
Now I feel that was a big mistake
If you hadn't come here
at least those 2 boys would be alive
Now both of them have left us
How can you defend yourself sir?
See I had no idea whatsoever
No one told me anything
When have you been
sober enough to understand?
Have you ever realized anytime
who is talking to you?
I have my share of personal problems
I am unable to come out of it
I can't
I'm unable to cry
I can't cry I can't sleep
at night either
That's why
I drink
I swear I never thought
it would be this horrific
Oh! You can never cry right?
'I can't understand
'Tell me without crying'
Charu where are you taking me
I never thought I would see them dead
This is the lady who gave birth
to those boys who are dead now
I had reassured her
A master will come
'He will save your boys'
Both sons were very fond of each other
They stick together like glue
My eldest told me just last week
'Let my younger brother study
I'll find some job to support us'
'A master was coming he said'
He was sure they will be rescued
But no one came
'My entire lineage has snapped'
Hey! Where are you?
Hurry up
- 'Listen to him
- He will get wild
You understood?
- Yov! Come here - You can go
- Sir - Who are they?
She is that master's
colleague it seems
Pack them all off and
move that master to the cell
Okay sir
Hey! Clear the other cases
out of the station
Okay sir
You can never cry? Can you?
Your eyes won't tear up
till the day you die
Get even more sloshed
'Why are you lamenting here?'
Shut up now!
Do I have to repeat myself?
Clear this place now madam
Clear out
Come with me sir
I swear-
Come along sir
Standing rooted to the spot
I swear I didn't expect any of this
Don't forget you are also responsible
for the death of those 2 boys
Convey my apologies to their mother
You are taking undue advantage
of the respect I'm giving you
Don't make me lose my temper
Stand right there
I sacrificed my children
in such an awful unjust way
'Hey! Come here'
Sir light some repellent
Mosquitoes are biting
Get in
- 'You want a mosquito repellent!
- Don't hit it hurts'
Listen Bhavani
Only you and I are left to contest
the Lorry Drivers' Union election
I have to win unopposed
'Looks like it may rain'
Can we have tea
and then discuss?
[sniffles]
'Master my name is Shiva
My elder brother is Mani
'He stole from a bakery for my sake
because I was starving'
'But they foisted some other case
on us and brought us here'
'Everything is wrong here master'
'They thrash us mercilessly'
'They stuff some powder
into our mouths'
'Immediately even our teeth
start shivering master'
'Don't know if it is day or night'
'We put up with all this
thinking it is for a short period'
'Now when we are
about to be released'
'...they want us to surrender
on some other murder case'
'Otherwise they are threatening
to kill our mother master'
Sister Charu assured us you will come
and be our savior rescue us'
'Please save us master'
'Our poor mother'
'She is all alone'
'Crying nonstop daily'
'I can't cry anymore master'
Please save us
Please save us somehow
Go ahead
I told you Bhavani
I want to win unopposed
I called you here
to arrive at a compromise
But still I can't trust you
You'll take any kind of cruel measure
using those juvenile delinquents
Should I step out of my house daily
with fear in every breath I exhale?
That is why you called me
Are you planning to kill me?
You
You call someone
with a plan to kill him
Treat him royally like a guest
and offer him hot tea
You're the only man who
asked me for permission to kill
Instead you could have-
Putting you on a pedestal I wanted to
fix an auspicious day to finish you off
'Hey! Wait'
I'll give you 2 minutes
Kill me and then save
your men and yourself
Do you need an army
to bash up 1 man?
Open the door
Hey he is a master
You have 10 minutes time
Finish him fast and come out
Turn the other way
Come Murali
Locked it
Even if you are reborn
pray I don't set eyes on you!
Master my boss has
given you a bus ticket
'Luxury bus
Air-condition sleeper'
Leave tonight you'll reach
your hometown in the morning
Got it into your head?
'If you stubbornly refuse'
You saw the 2 boys
hanging from the roof?
I'm talking to you
Is that a love letter in your hand?
Mani
[reading under his breath]
Refusing to surrender in the murder case
and ended up dead those 2 tramps-
Kill him
Sir?
They will kill the master.
Please hurry up sir.
'Open the door'
Hey Surrender. Open the door.
'Open the door. Hey Surrender!
Speak
Bhavani! Master....
Who are you?
Who is behind this?
What is your motive?
Why do you use these innocent boys?
I don't know any of this
But I will find out
Crooks like you using these
little boys for crimes
I will find out. I will search
and come before you
I will make you answer
for the death of those 2 boys
Master
Whatever I'm about to say
is nothing new for you
Still I'll say it
and you just listen
I'm waiting!
[confident laughter]
Wait for me. I'm coming...
Oh brother Das! He has come again.
Is there no one to save me?'
Say man! Hooo!
If you encounter me
you'll be finished master
If you cross our path you will go mad.
Master you've been staring
at the rope for a long time?
Want to play on it as a swing?
What song that?
Let me tell a 'Chitti' story
Hey! Hey! Not 'Chitti'
Saaaad story!
"Let me tell a sad story"
"Zip lip or slip Skip and trip"
"Chill my master!"
"Chill out master"
Hey master!
Chill your beers!
'Youths to the youngest ones
are doped day and night bro'
'When they are intoxicated
they are not in control of their senses'
'Both have plenty of
criminal cases against them'
'2 boys who died are sheer poison'
'Both must have died
when totally tanked sir'
'They won't toe the line with
their parents or with our rules'
They are arrogant boys
who insist their word is law
'There are 10-12 year olds
with all kinds of diseases in here'
All dazed and doped
Who told you they were
good-for-nothing boys?
Both are 24 carat gold sir
Both those boys who died
They called a girl I know
on the night they died
You mean Charu?
Yes Charu
I know Charu and I know
who killed those 2 boys too
We have tried our level best
But we are unable to stop
the dope and booze supply
How can drugs enter the premises
without your knowledge sir?
They have so many routes
to supply sir
Without the wardens' support
'...nothing can be brought in sir'
As per our rule book no violence on
our boys who are all below 18 here
Using that as an excuse
they will bring the roof down!
Presuming others' fears
are their plus
...these are riff-raffs
who rule the roost
Poor chaps! Trapped for life
caught in Bhavani's web
Who is Bhavani?
Beast!
- Bhava... Bhavani?
- Don't know anyone by that name
Sir don't simply keep
asking questions
Got any other work
carry on okay?
See you sir?
Let's go
'Teachers who came here earlier
to reform these boys'
...would have made a hasty retreat
thinking their family takes priority
But my story is completely different
I have no one to call my own sir
'The day I saw those 2 boys
hang right in front of my eyes'
Their eyes....
Tongues...
I died sir
If you can help me
I will change everything here
For this cause whatever strife
I don't care even if I lose my life
I'll do and show it.
If you do anything legally abiding
with rules and regulations,
I will stand behind you sir
"Since how long
have I been roaming."
"Times are changing on the whole"
"My life says enough..."
Forgive me mother
"Quit liquor... Quit habit..."
"Run him out...
Don't delay any further..."
"Quit liquor... Quit habit..."
"Quit liquor... Quit habit..."
You got me wrong Bhavani
Ever since Gurumurthy died
...everyone is scared
to contest for that post
I've spoken to the district councilor
In another 2 days
...it will be announced
you won unopposed
Come here
Bro she is the cause of everything
She registered the case it seems
Our boys sent her photo just now
What should we do with her?
Can't you handle a girl?
As if you need a priest to choose
an auspicious time! Get lost!
Bhavani even if someone else
occupies this post, he must listen to you
Then why do you aspire for this post?
Fear stemming out of murder
is short lived
But fear derived from a post of power
and authority lasts a lifetime right?
After this I'm entering politics
Don't know how many people
I have to kill there.
- Don't get it Bhavani
- All God's will
Our boys will shoulder the sin
"Commander"
"Commander"
Hey master!
- 'Looking tip-top like a new groom?
- Correct man'
He looks different right?
'Master is in a mood
to teach us a lesson'
Do you think he's married?
'If he was married'
And if his wife looks hot
Suuuper! Isn't it brother?
All of you stand height-wise
Shorter ones in front
Taller ones in the back
Come on fast
If you come clean shaven
you think we'll get scared?
- 'Move on to your next job
- At least pretend to be scared'
Poor master!
Let me repeat
Fall in line Stand height-wise
Hey master! You can't change us
with height but can with strength
This chap like a dunce
Pickpocket case
But he's a pipsqueak
But our little black ant
had the guts to kill
Cut above the rest
He is the heaviest of us all
What is your name?
You heard me? What is your name?
Master you can't lay a finger on us
Know that right?
Sir you can't lay a finger on the boys
Rules
'Don't hit them and
get caught unnecessarily'
'Like a new starched shirt
sir is all stiff and spruced up'
It is wrong only
if I bash up the boys?
Yes, I told you that
What are you doing, why are you hitting?
You may be a master!
You raise hands at us?
We are wardens here
We told you not to hit the boys
So you're beating us?
"Don't run over him and
look the other way"
Don't beat him sir
Sir! Sir! Sir!
It hurts sir Please don't hit
Sir I'm going to Sabarimala
I have taken vow of pilgrimage
Why? What happened to your devotion
when you were peddling drugs?
- Name?
- Bharath
Mallesh! Ram Pandu
Ramesh - Tamil
- Sree Selam Ramesh -Tamil
- Sree Sailam
Yadagiri
Inspection! Everyone line up in a row
Bhavani! Master is creating
too many problems.
'He bashed up all the wardens'
'He raided the premises and burnt
all the drugs dopes and phones'
'What to do with him now?'
How did a master muster
so much courage?
Find out who is backing him up
Inquire about his background.
Come! Let's go!
Hey love birds! Will you do the
work which we came for?
Will you come?
What? Trapping the girl?
Hey, leave me... leave me I say
I'm telling you, leave me I say
Remove your hands! Sir don't cut....
Sir! Sir!
Master you had your way eh?
You can trim my hair
or tonsure my head
Try your tricks on my leader Ulligadu!
Hey Ulligadu! Listen to me'
- Don't go there go to your block
- Shut up warden
- Hello boss - Morning bro
Who had the guts to
lay a finger on our hair?
Is there a rule on
the long and short of it?
Master do you know the rules or not?
You are having a free hand
with everyone's heads
Master
Let go of me master
You don't know whom
you're laying your hands on.
You will regret what you're doing
Gosh! You're scaring me!
Hey Dheena
Crew cut!
You can go
Next week will be
back to square one
You can come back
and scrub it again okay?
Bye sweetheart
I've never seen such bad
nicotine stains at so young an age JD
Their mouths smell like filth
'I have collected cavity samples
from the 6 boys you mentioned'
- How long will it take?
- I'll let you know in 1 or 2 days
Thanks Madhu
He left me with a half shaved
mustache and beard
Such a disgrace!
I feel like I am naked!
I'm so mad I feel like...
'I feel like stabbing him right now'
When you get your hands dirty
enemies will come and go
If we rage like a mad bull against every
single enemy our life will be ruined
Handle him with patience
'Make him run in all 4 directions'
Don't let him sleep
- Torture him mentally
- I'll tackle him
- 'Hey-' - You cut the call
[overlap of angry voices]
Hey! stop
- What happened?
- Sir I don't know
They just started a brawl
and hit each other
Back door is open in A block
What to do now?
Go look for the key
Don't let anyone out
- Lock them up in the class
- Okay bro
Give me the torch
Hello bro
- 'Yes tell me'
- None of our boys are missing I hope
Bro head count is correct 63
'Not one of them is missing'
'They came from outside for sure'
Ohhh! Its burning....
No brother You're hurting me
What happened?
What happened to you? Tell me!
Master they broke his hand
Do something master
'Hit them at least once master'
Hey master! You had the gall
to shave half my mustache
That's why I knifed your body!
This will go on everyday.
We will escape from here tonight
Try to stop us if you can
'I was on my bike
sticking to the kerb side'
Whether he collided by mistake
or deliberately targeted me
'Only God knows'
'But his intention is to provoke you'
Only then you'll get angry and show
your fist power on a handful of boys
'They will use that as excuse
and pack you off from here'
'Don't act rashly on impulse'
Only his leg is fractured
Hand is intact right?
Sorry ra
I couldn't do anything to help you
It's okay forget it
What can you do?
My fear is those grown up boys are
waiting to pounce on us in kabaddi
And we have to play against
those beefy buffaloes it seems
In case we lose...
...we'll be 'banchans'
this entire month
'Banchan' means?
Being an errand boy
To be under their beck and call
Do all their dirty jobs like a slave
I'll anyway lose
'I am agreeable to being an 'banchan'
but they insist I should play master'
I snitched to you right?
Using Kabaddi as an excuse
as if it's just a game
'...they plan to bash me up master'
'Hey hundi...!'
Come ra
Look here
Look at me
'I am calling you... hey!'
Coming or shall I lift you
and bring you here to play?
More than the aches
from blows and kicks
Pain from fear hurts deeper!
Go with courage ra
Go and check what he's doing
Das he is coming
Tell me Madhu
You snitched about us
to the master right?
- Face us now - Hey!
I know very well ra
If Bawar plays we will win for sure
So you got scared and
broke his hand right?
Had he been here
would he have defeated us?
For sure then you would
have lost pathetically
Call how many ever whomever
you want from here to play on your side
I'll call anyone I want
But you shouldn't
go back on your word
Call we won't send you back
without breaking all your teeth today!
MAAASTER!
"Clash of wills here"
"No one to face in arena"
"To win over him"
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi"
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi"
- Tell me Madhu
- 'I checked the results'
I am sure all 6 of them
are above 20 years of age
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... play"
"No one to face in arena"
"To win over him"
"No one to face in arena"
What are you saying?
Not one of them is less than 18?
100% sure in those 6 boys
no one is younger than 18
Master at least do you know
the name of this game?
'This is not cricket or football'
You must hold your breath and
repeat 'kabaddi' you know?
Our rules are different
You can't just touch and run
You must toss your opponent
outside the line
What... still want to play?
Come on ra
Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi
Buddy, you're out if you
step out of the line
Kabaddi... kabaddi... ra!
- Go back - Hold his hand
"No one to face in arena"
Das
Bingo!
Watch it!
Come on
Hey! He is hitting us real hard
Soooper master
Wait I'll go
If you have the guts show it now
Come... come on
Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi
Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi
- Hand... break his hand huh?
- Awww! It hurts
Master you are hurting me
[loud cheering]
'Come on now Show your strength'
"No one to face in arena"
"To win over him"
Crossed the line
If you dare lay a finger
on these boys just once more
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi!"
Master?
Master...?
- What?
- Is it okay to talk frankly?
- Camera is recording everything
- Go on doesn't matter
I'll tell you master
My mother passed away
when I was born
My neighbor akka raised me
My father asked that sister
if she will sleep with him!
That's why
I threw the grinding stone on his head
Immediately the police put me in jail
'That's when I got
trapped with Das anna'
From then on I had to listen
only to what Das anna says
Das anna will walk in
He will check who is addicted to drugs
Powder smoke booze
He will increase the dosage
Which one of you here
...has seen Bhavani?
Bhavani?
Where have I heard this name?
'Somehow sounds familiar'
Master
We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him
Das anna is 'be all and end all' here
'We must obey him implicitly'
'If he asks us to surrender
we should do so with our eyes closed'
Otherwise we will be hanged
'They recently hanged 2 boys'
'Didn't you see that master?'
Do you all want to go home
and live with your family?
Or do you want to surrender?
- Go home master
- Be with our family
You have been here for 10 days
We haven't taken to drugs till now
Only now we know our own selves
Somehow save us from here master
If you follow what I say you can
go home and live as you wish
Will you do as I say?
- Yes master - We will
Whatever you shared with me now
will you tell the same to the magistrate?
Of course we will master
I'll arrange all the formalities
to get them out on parole
Thanks sir
Let the video evidence
be with Charu till then
It will reach the magistrate
when you say so
Master you shot some video
and cleverly made us confess
You haven't shared your story
Tell us Let's listen
'Ask him ra'
Are you chewing pan, huh?
- Tell us - Tell us master
'Please share your story master'
We are asking right?
Please tell us
Don't ask for trouble
Voice of experience!
Wait they are very eager to hear
I'll be happy to share
Let them enjoy
I was in college then
'I think it was my final year'
A new teacher joined our college
Her name was Sithara
Unbelievable one in a million 'Love'
All of a sudden that girl I loved
...met with an accident
'She forgot her past'
She didn't even know who I was
She even forgot my mad love for her
Fate made me attend her wedding
present a bouquet with my own hands!
After that-
Hey! Why are all of you
sniffling and crying?
Now that girl has totally
forgotten our past
Master isn't that teacher akka?
Hey this akka is teacher
working as my colleague now
That was my college time
'Premam' Sithara teacher
Hey don't you watch love story films?
If I don't understand the language
- I won't watch - Okay
Getting late All of you leave
Class tomorrow morning as usual
Okay master Bye master
How much longer will you quote a film story
if someone asks you about your past life?
Fool yourself in the bargain
and trick others too?
Which is a film story?
Don't act
What you narrated was
film 'Premam'
Copy cats! They stole my story
and it is released huh?
One track mind
on plagiarism huh?
Okay what do you want to know?
Tell me
Why did you start drinking?
Every drunkard will have a story
Why go into it now?
If I tell you my reason
...a handful of them
will follow my footsteps
Is that necessary?
Isn't it wrong?
Okay... okay
I won't tell you now
why I got into this habit
If you like I'll tell you
why I quit shall I?
"Beautiful are his gazes...
That plays love tunes..."
"He came closer...
Changed my heart forever..."
"All of me... It's him...
It's him... Standing..."
"Walking... In dreams...
Never seen another face..."
"Modesty... It's him... It's him.."
"Moving like waves...
Smiles ooze beauty..."
"Flowery heart...
Standstill age..."
"I pity poor girls..."
"Glow of flowerpots...
Royal swag..."
"Classy Master is mass..."
"Cracker look... A look is enough...
Failed heart too starts pulsating..."
"He's single, that's news...
This is good chance..."
"Beautiful are his gazes...
That plays love tunes..."
"He came closer...
Changed my heart forever..."
JD is an orphan
Just grew like a wild tree
Only after joining this college
'...he met a professor'
'His friendship and care
changed JD's life altogether'
Professor Viswam!
But unfortunately he had a health issue
'He got admitted
in a hospital to get treated-'
That really shattered JD
After that he was unable to sleep
'That bloody alcohol took over him'
"Walking... In dreams...
Never seen another face..."
"Modesty... It's him... It's him.." "Moving
like waves... Smiles ooze beauty..."
"Flowery heart...
Standstill age..."
"Best friend... Man of words..."
"One of a kind...
Magnetic vision..."
"Sharp and smart..."
"Always Master is top..."
"Always seen in him...
If he arrives solo..."
"Beautiful are his gazes...
That plays love tunes..."
What-?
Please move
Hey, go man.
Come
Tell me Charu
Sir don't know who they are
'2 or 3 boys are chasing me'
Charu where are you? Which area?
In Kothapet Goddess Mother temple
Road opposite the temple
Charu?
Charu...?
Hey... hey...
'They started chasing me when I was
on my way to the magistrate's house'
I don't know what to do
or where to go
Charu don't be scared
'I will send our boys'
Go inside some shop there
'Enter a shop to be safe'
- I've come into a shop sir
- Turn on the speaker
What do you need?
'Bro 1 minute please
Listen to what I have to say'
'Appreciate it if you can
hide this girl for a while'
I'll send my men please
My business will get affected
Don't involve me please leave
Aren't you a fiery blooded youth?
'Speak boldly'
Bro I'll take care
- 'You don't worry'
- Thank you sir
Come here dear
- Did a girl come in here?
- No
"How smooth your cheeks are"
"How tender the bud is"
[song 'Jagadekaveerudu Athilokasundari']
- Master they are teasing m-
- Sshhhhhhhhhh!
'I told you no one came in here'
'Bro where are you going in?'
'Listen'
'He already told you no one is here'
Oldie shut up
Give it of your own accord
Or else just 2 punches
I'll smash your face
If I have to grab it from you-
- I'll cut you into pieces.
- Come master
This face looks familiar
'Akka'
'Turn your phone towards him'
- He's inside, let's go
Hey Bulliga...!
'Hey Mallesh my dear friend!'
Bulli ra
What are you doing
in this video call?
Hey, the girl you are chasing is my akka
- 'Your sister?
- Yes'
I didn't know that
I was asked to finish her
That's way I chased her
But tell me why are you chasing her?
- What is that?
- She has a camera
I believe she has a camera
Ask her to give it
and we'll leave
Akka give him what he wants
We will deal with this differently
'Okay?'
'Just give it akka'
'Hey Mallesh'
I told you she's my sister
I didn't hear your apology?
- Apologize to her - Sorry akka
'Hey! You boys too'
Sorry akka
Glad you are that scared of me!
Master end of incident
Akka safe from any accident
You talk to her I'll wait there
Charu leave that place immediately
"Play band and enjoy to the hilt"
"Take a knife and cut his head"
"Keep a blade ready and give a pose"
Hey, what's happening?
Who are you all?
Look
What is this tattoo?
This branding?
When boys are sent to this Home
Das anna will pick up
the sharp ones and train us
When we get released he will tattoo
our hand like this
If we show this tattoo in the Mess
we can eat to our stomach's content
If you are older you'll get
plenty of booze and cigarettes
You can get clothes for free
from their textile shop
They will even get you
dope from a pharmacy
But the hitch is
Every now and then they will
make us surrender for a crime
Not to get back into the old
bad ways I'm staying aloof
'We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him'
'Das anna is 'be all and end all' here'
'We must obey him implicitly'
- Is it a newly released film?
- 'No one can defy him'
'He asks you to surrender
we should with our eyes closed'
How did you lose track of her?
Don't know how Bhavani
I sent only professionals
Somehow they messed up-
What do we do with this bro?
It has a card inside which stores
whatever we shoot or click
Break that card alone and
keep the camera at my place
Okay
When are they announcing the results?
Heard it's Monday or Tuesday
You'll anyway win unopposed
Why should you be tense?
- I can enjoy right?
- Yes then what?
Sit here
Do you know this ostrich?
A bird with a long neck like this
Have you seen its egg?
It will be this big
So big in size
But only that ostrich will know
the pain of hatching such an egg!
Will you sit here even after
I've explained to you?
No brother
- Get lost!
- Sorry, brother
Bhavani boys want a booze party
You won't anyway drink
At least for them-
Drink to dig your own grave
- Go ahead
- Thanks a lot Bhavani
Goodnight
Somehow you made me
show you this place
I was staying away
from this place
Let's go back master
Wait I have a good reason
We'll go soon
'Right you haven't come here to eat'
I thought you were inviting me
for a candle light dinner
Last time I came here
there was no power
They had lit only candles
Okay relax
Don't look at this place
I heard the food here is super
'Get a token for the meals'
'Madam you too'
I thought we'll have some privacy
Close your eyes and
show me your right hand
- Why?
- Show I'll tell you
You shouldn't open your eyes
till I tell you
'Open now'
That boy's hand in the saloon
had this same mark
Show this over there
Ask for 'meals' token
Why should I-
All for a good reason
Go and show your hand
'We don't differentiate or discriminate'
'Whoever has that tattoo
on their hands...'
...we give them whatever they ask
Bhavani's boys will take care of the rest
What is this for?
Still some balance left
in the bucket list!
"Start a tradition...
Announce beating thigh..."
"Buddy, march ahead...
Beacon has arrived..."
"Let dust fly away...
When you play drums..."
"Nerves must shiver...
When you band it hard..."
"Beat it"
"Till new dawn breaks...
Rock it all the way..."
"Till you reach finish line...
Don't play half heartedly.."
"Here comes God who can
give death to Lord Yama..."
"Hey, bro..."
"No where seen God has
come before us..."
"Combing streets and corners...
Never search for anything..."
"Not brave enough
to go against anyone..."
'Bhavani!'
That master is churning in my mind
Tell him to kill that master
tomorrow before day break
Why wait till tomorrow morning?
We can close his chapter right now
Shut your gob Just do what I say
Careful booze da
"Clenched fists are playing tabala...
Breaking it..."
"Who is playing it?
We can judge with the sound of finger..."
'Bhavani!'
"Clenched fists are playing tabala...
Breaking it..."
"Who is playing it?
We can judge with the sound of finger..."
"Breaking open chest timber of soil...
He has come..."
"Man to break your backs...
Man to rip out your skin is here..."
'Master...!'
"Start a tradition...
Announce beating thigh..."
"Buddy, march ahead...
Beacon has arrived..."
"Let dust fly away...
When you play drums..."
"Nerves must shiver...
When you band it hard..."
"Beat it"
"Till new dawn breaks...
Rock it all the way..."
Give me Sugar pack if you have
I don't stock drugs
"Here comes God who can
give death to Lord Yama..."
'Hey boy'
"No where seen God has
come before us..."
Forward all the videos
to the police department
I'll bring the boys
to the Magistrate directly
Okay
Master
This is Bhavani anna's truck
I've heard he comes here often
Let's go there
Aiyaiyo! Are you joking master?
I am not coming
You go if you want
You make sound I'll stab you
Go
[incessant chatter]
Knock ra
To top it all a secret code!
If any hand reaches out to his weapon
He will end up a corpse
- Switch off the damn song
- Kneel man
- Switch it off!
- Kneel down
Who is Bhavani here?
Huh?
Which one of you here
has seen Bhavani?
What kind of sissy name
is that... Bhavani?
Was he lying on his stomach
as a baby when he was named?
Shabaa!
Let me make it clear once more
If any of you do something stupid
trying to retaliate
I'll sign on your man's
Adam's apple, got it?
'Try your luck flinging another bottle?'
That means
You know Bhavani very well
Will you go and repeat this
to him verbatim?
Bhavani... Bhavani
Bhavani... Bhavani
A man walked in right royally
knowing it is your den Bhavani
Repeat ra
No you tell me I'll convey it
No you are scared
'Listen I might as well tell all of you'
The day you killed those 2 boys in
the Observation Home and hung them
I hung my head in guilt and died
I'm least bothered about myself hereafter
Branding those juveniles with a tattoo
and making them do your dirty work
I've put a full stop to it
From now on anyone wants to do anything
using the boys as lambs for the slaughter
...has to kill me and then go ahead
but that has a slight hitch
I will kill minimum 10 of you
and only then breathe my last
Be it Bhavani or Bhanumathi!!!
Will you go and tell him
word by word?
Come get up
Close the door
Who threw that bottle at me ra?
Come here
No Bhavani
I aimed it at him
The pen will fall down and
you can escape I thought
'But it missed and-'
Hey! Lazy lout Open the door
'Open the door'
Attacks brother in our presence
Son of a gun! Open it damn you!
If you're a man, open it
'Hey! Open... open it I say
- Hey, Bikshapathi - Come now
- Hey Bhikshapathi - Eh?
Bro is calling you
Come here
- Why did you go up?
- He locked us in
He was holding a knife
to my neck for an hour
WTH were you doing then?
Bhavani that wasn't a knife
- It was a pen
- You knew it huh?
How will he open the door
if you yell after he has gone?
Shall we pen him a letter?
'Sir please open the door'
Don't hit me Bhavani
Who can draw very well here?
Master he is our best artist
He's the madcap who doodles foul stuff
all over the toilet and the walls master
'Hi master'
I believe you came to my den
Threatened a man with a pen and
conveyed an important message to Bhavani
I am that Bhavani
'Greetings'
If you destroy all that I own
textile shop hotel wine shop
What the hell will he do?
He is himself a criminal
'You assumed I won't
go to the police right?'
Your assumption is 100% right
But thinking you'll make
an ass of me was wrong
'I enquired about you'
I believe you have a big gang
of ardent fan followers
'Which one of them can I finish off?
I asked my boys their choice'
They said we can have a jolly time
killing them all without discrimination
'I will give you a 'Things to do'
Take a pen and paper'
List out your favorites
in alphabetical order
Bha... Bhavani!
Don't ignore girls and kids
thinking I'll be soft on them
Include their names too definitely
'Write and call each one of them'
And then... master?
Bro...?
- Give me the phone
- 'Hello...?'
- Why did he hang up on me?
- 'Must have got scared'
Got very emotional I guess
Why he is getting hyper for no reason?
Here bro
What has happened huh?
Pick... pick... pick up my call
Pick up
- Hi dude - Where are you?
I'm just leaving my office
- You are safe?
- Yes what's the problem?
'Listen to me Don't step out'
What is the proble-
Come on pick up
- Sir?
- WHERE ARE YOU?
- Shut up-
- 'I hope you're safe?'
- 'Yes sir what happened?'
- Listen
Check if our batch students
are safe okay?
'Madhu where is he?'
'He is here JD'
- What is it?
- 'Stay at home don't go out'
'Everything safe?'
JD called me
'He was so hassled'
'He told us not to step out'
Guys don't step out of your house
Most important avoid road travel
'In case you are out go to any house
or shop nearby or any safe place'
'JD sir called just now
I think there's a major problem'
'If you are safe'
For heaven's sake
text our entire group
Park the bike
'Almost everyone in the group
texted they are safe'
But we couldn't reach
only Bhargav and Savitha sir
Don't swerve too much to the right
Careful!
Hello?
I am safe-
Vanitha where are you?
In a mall nearby What happened?
- Is he with you?
- 'Yes ra'
He has gone to fetch
my purse from the car-
'VANITHA WHAT HAPPENED?'
'What happened Vanitha?'
'Vanitha talk to me
What is the mat-'
VANITHA
- 'Where are you ra?'
- Theater why sir?
- Are you alright?
- What happened?
SRI...!
SRI REI!
SRI!
Hey!
Hey! Get out
- What happened?
- Savitha go
'Bhargav'
BHARGAV!
'Bhargav...!'
' SIR!'
Sir...!
Bhargav is dead sir
[anguished cries]
Master
How many wickets down?
'According to the News I got'
2 wickets down 2 retired hurt
If you are still stubborn enough
to hang out with that gang
...you'll lose 4 wickets daily
'I have never forgiven anyone
who has crossed my path till now'
This is my first time
and I am forgiving you
Just quit your job do an 'about turn'
and disappear from this town
'Otherwise one who escaped today
will die tomorrow and repeat'
It will go on repeat mode
They will keep falling like ninepins
Thank you and good bye
Hey... hey! Master... master
'The main reason I called you'
I didn't lie face down
when I was named it seems
I was on my back
it was clear as a bell!
- Hey - 'Aahn'
- REI!
- 'Hahn?'
Son of a gun!
Junk of a jerk!
I'll dice you dry and
pickle you to pieces
Thank you Goodbye
Take care of them just for today
I'll be back soon
Don't worry you go
'I will ensure the safety of these boys'
- Aiyo! Let go of me bro
- Shut up get into the truck
- Bro let go of me - Hit you
Where are you taking me?
- Leave me bro - Get in!
- I won't come let me be
- Hey! Get in
Hey, come!
- Lift him - Don't force me bro
- No... no - Listen to me
Dasu... Dasu
Don't do this Das
Leave them... poor kids
'Hello sir
I'm Venkat Rao speaking'
'Das and his boys beat us badly'
'He has taken the boys
who turned approvers'
'In a truck somewhere sir'
'We don't know what to do
Please come soon sir'
Yes Vanitha
'This is not new to me'
You have gone out of your way
for these boys enough
'I have informed the higher authorities
They said they will be here soon'
I don't care two hoots
about the repercussion
I'll take full blame
Beat the hell out of them
Hold this
Master... master ra
Bad penny back again huh?
Plan to hit us?
Go ahead
Come here
Think you've achieved
something great in life
Come on laugh
You-
Bhargav
He is dead ra
Bhargav created much more trouble
in college than all of you put together
He is dead now
If a real rowdy reforms and just when
he wants to lead a good life if he dies-
Do you know it is
the height of cruelty?
The faith people around him have
to turn over a new leaf will vanish
Oh my gawd!
Master has started preaching to us
Ignore them bro
Why do you treat them
on an equal footing with you?
These mongrels won't reform
even if they die!
Hey! How can they reform?
When have we treated him with respect?
Or given him time place
or an opportunity to reform?
Golisoda Ulligadu Blade Babji Chain Shiva
Soda Sekar what kind of names?
Then how will they remember
their family or tender love and care?
Family and society alienate them
If everybody has exiled him
how will he reform?
Come here ra
What?
1st crime by many boys here
is based on emotion quotient
Affection betrayal anger
or a rush of adrenalin
Each with a reason
But after the first time
You know what instigates you to commit
every crime you pile on to your account?
Intoxication!
I can bet on this ra
All other crimes after your 1st was
committed losing control of your senses
Didn't you booze?
Didn't you have a ball?
Oh! Yes sir
Open your warped mind!
Only a drunkard can talk
of how it ruined his family
Only because of my addiction
2 boys lost their lives
I got that into my thick head
I quit drinking
'Chee! Don't be a drama king master!'
Am I brewing liquor at home?
Blaming the buyer
instead of the seller!
That's exactly what I'm saying
This intoxication is a political game
You are not yet 18 years
You can't watch this Adult film
A security guard stands out
to push you out right?
Why is no one standing guard
outside a wine shop?
How do 10 -15 year olds get hold
of a booze bottle and cigarette?
Politics
Bhavani is moving his pawn
and playing this kind of politics
When the law is against child labor
...that beast is forcing the same boys
into nefarious activities unwillingly
What is this?
What is it?
Like bribing you to vote and
you end up with an inked finger
He gives you freebies and
brands you with a tattoo
He has bathed you in basic amenities
providing free food and clothing
Why would you reform?
Enough of this atrocity
You have packed those boys who believed
they have a good future into that truck
Don't know if they will hang from a fan
or be run over by a tyre
But
I will save them
Every single one of them
What did he say ra?
He will kill all those who like me?
Hey!
[amused laughter]
There are zillions outside who like me
Mind body heart and soul da
If he's a man let him try his luck
Bro...?
Bhavani's proxies files, documents, money,
filling it in a container,
They were discussing of crossing
border overnight, brother
Children too are in it
Bhavani - hmm
All 40 lorries have crossed the border
Expected anytime now
How many hour?
One hour, Das is bringing them
in the container
Hey, go!
Go
Hold my Hand
Finish her off!
Hold my hand
Come inside
Collide into his car and kill him
Come... come
'Enough... Enough'
If those 15 boys turn approvers
whom will they point a finger at?
Das of course
They have not knew you Bhavani
What if Das turns approver?
They will tell your name
Then kill Das
Go
Go....Go ra
Do you want him to kill me
out of your sight?
You always say
'I will give my life for you'
Give it.
I thought of you
as my own elder brother - What?
I regarded you as my (brother)
Even I thought of you
as my very own younger brother
'What do you want me to do?'
Where are the boys?
Where are they ra?
Hey! Go and check the container
Go... move it
Bloody-
Let's see who wins You or me?
Das listen to me
Listen to me JUST LISTEN!
Hear me out
Oral statement by all those boys
point fingers accusingly only at you
They don't even know the name Bhavani
Bhavani knows that too
Give it serious thought
Will he kill all the boys?
Or kill the one they are pointing
fingers at which is YOU?
You deserve to die
In one swift blow I'll-
I not came for that...
Let's stop with the lives already lost
I'm saying this like a broken record
Bhavani is clever
He won't kill the boys
His target is YOU
Listen to me once Only this time
Ask him if you can bring the boys
in front of him he will say 'no'
Continue to ask repeatedly
You'll know the true colors of Bhavani
If this doesn't happen-
My life is yours
Welcome master!
This is the first time
we are meeting right?
Loaded with emotion huh?
My dear master
Bhavani isn't just a name
It's a kingdom I created for myself
You can't create a world record
with your overnight lesson
If he was sharing his pearls of wisdom
what about the mud between your ears?
You carried that boy on your waist?
Did you think they are kids?
They are killers of the worst kind
I've already given you too much time
Still I'll give you 2 minutes
If you can ki-
Master why did you hit me in mid speech?
Didn't you ask for it?
Come
Is this all the force you can muster?
Master
[fired up laughter]
Hi....
Bring him
[overlap of anxious voices]
Master...
Job done and dusted
'Lord pardon this sinner'
Master - Don't!
Do not kill him
Hey! I am fighting here for your sake
So your hands don't grip
a knife once more
Wrong
I'm fighting your cause for your mind
not to go back to its old ways
Not one of you
Not even one of you
should raise his hand
Step back
MOVE BACK!
"O master, no one is there
to touch me in Warangal"
"wherever I am, I rule the roost"
"That's my word"
Remix! 'How was it?'
Started taking lessons
before entering class, last lesson?
Get up
'Master... master'
'Master... master'
'Master... master'
- Hey... hey - Master
- Take the boys to the truck
Hey Dasu
"Twinkle twinkle little star,
Bhavani got the kick"
"Thrashed him and punched him"
"Twinkle twinkle little star,
Bhavani got the kick"
"Thrashed him and punched him"
Master... wait
Sit down
Master
A problem won't be solved
by killing a person
I asked a man when I was just 17
This is the same request
I'm asking you
Let me live
I will do anything for you
I won't harm those boys
You are the one who made
those innocent children criminals
One-
Only 1 year
You were let into that Observation Home
and you've progressed so much in life
If you are punished and sent to jail
imagine what you'll do to this town
I'll get into politics
I'll start a party
Will you join me?
Master
What?
Sssshhhhhh!
[triumphant laughter]
Done and dusted
"Let me sing a 'chitti' story
Pay attention listen to me"
"If you want take it or else
no need tension leave it baby"
"Life is very short dude"
- Master - Who is that?
The boys are in the truck master
Come here Sit down
Sit
Shall I surrender instead of you?
Won't you understand till the very end?
Each person has to endure
the punishment according to his crime
Madcap!
I feel I should do something for you
Tell me if you have a family
I'll take care of them till you're back
I overheard the children in the reformatory
saying you loved a girl it seems
A girl from an affluent family
Already engaged to someone
Shall I go and talk to her?
This looks good proposal!
Listen my dear brother
My name was not JD then
Jack Daniels
People called me 'Jack'
I used to draw well
Good at a game of cards
In such a game we were lucky
My friend and I won 2 tickets
You would have seen everyone
run to catch a bus or train
But imagine we ran and caught a ship
about to leave the dock
Huh?
That's where I set eyes on her
for the very 1st time
Her name was Rose
What did you say her name was?
Rose
Rose... Jack
Listen to my love story
After I fell head over heels
in love with her I found out
...she's already engaged
After that as we were sailing smoothly
The ship hit an iceberg on the way?
How do you know that?
I'll wait outside master
- Listen to my full epic love story
- No need it's okay master
I'll wait outside
'Since manipulation of boys into crimes
by anti social elements was proved'
'The Observation Home was shut down'
'Of the 63 inmates those above 18
were sent to Central Prison'
'And those below 18 were sent
to other Govt reformatories'
Press your thumb on this stamp pad
and give your fingerprint
Not there
Go inside
What is the crime you are serving term for?
Baby face partner
Must be a gigolo
Look at his face
Like a parcel folded into four
Juveniles of Warangal
in that Bhavani case
I heard it was 7 of them
Only 6 are here
Baby face is here
handsome face is missing
Where is the master?
Must have been sent
to Chanchalguda jail
It's even more convenient partner
We go to Chanchalguda in 10 days
We'll finish him there
Then we will meet your master
in Chanchalguda
Transfer only after 10 days huh?
- Are you here till then?
- Why?
Drag that 'beedi'
This is the last 'beedi' you'll smoke
Commands that kind of fear huh?
You're teaching ME
about the 'prisoner'!!
You would have seen
big shot prisoners
But guess who is coming now
