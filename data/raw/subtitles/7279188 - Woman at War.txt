Good morning.
Calm down!
Woman!
If you want to help me,
it has to be now.
They are looking for me.
What did you do?
I knocked out the power lines.
- So it's you?
- Yes.
It’s the 5th time.
- You are in this alone?
- Yes.
You want to make me
an accomplice?
I’m not a criminal, I’m trying
to stop crimes against us.
Who are your kin?
My name is Halla,
I’m the daughter of Benedikt Sigurðsson.
My grandmother is from here.
So you're Eyvík's stock.
I know your people.
So you're Bensi's daughter...
What I have done,
I believe with all my heart
to be right.
Woman!
Bark!
Woman! Bark!
They saw your trail on the heath
heading down here.
They're going to send
the bloodhounds,
so you are not invited to stay.
I can't spare the Jeep.
I can lend you this one.
You return it when you can.
Before the next
Independence Day.
You have to get a feel
for the clutch.
I can say I stole it.
It’s up to you.
Thanks for your help.
We don't talk about it much
around here,
but probably my father
was not his father's son.
Your grandfather,
Sigurður from Eyvík,
was a man of extremes
like most of his kin
and stepped in for
a few husbands around here.
So you and me could be
second cousins.
Really!
So thank you, cousin.
Alleged cousin.
Let's see if this will be
of any help.
Woman!
Stay.
Authorities have acknowledged
that the repeated outages
are the result
of organized sabotage.
Yet, no one has claimed
responsibility so far.
Þorbjörn Gíslason,
shift manager at the smelter:
Was there less damage this time?
Yes.
But it's very expensive
to run it on oil,
still it's better than
the cooling of the metal.
That would be a huge loss.
According to our sources,
a man has been arrested
following the outage.
A foreign male
was brought in for questioning.
So sorry, darlings, I’m late.
Mea culpa.
Have you warmed up?
Great! Let's start
with a small spring song
to heat up the soul.
So, dear friends.
"The land of flora
and the land of my brother".
There's a difference.
Learn it.
A small break,
I need to make some copies.
Baldvin, can you help me?
"Baldwinner" all the time.
Not bad to have a ministry man
for the paperwork.
What was the helicopter
doing there?
Some accident at Laugarvatn.
I didn't know.
- This was too close.
- I know.
You have to stop now!
The Americans will monitor
the highlands from space.
They've ordered a satellite
and thermal cameras.
The lines will be monitored.
When is the satellite expected?
I don't know.
One week, maybe Jess.
Can it see through clouds?
That's not a chance
you can take.
Your mission is accomplished.
The Chinese have withdrawn.
They have just postponed.
They are still here.
It’s just diplomacy. They
consider the country unsafe.
It’s not just
between Iceland and China,
there is more at stake.
Rio Tinto is threatening to sue
for billions.
You don't need to go on!
It’s all over the media,
everybody is freaking out.
And you?
And me what?
Are you taking your medication?
Yes... no.
I’m cutting down to 25mg.
It’s going fine.
Listen,
you don't get
what is going on...
They've got generators now.
The next time
I need to bring down the pylons
for some real damage.
We have to finish the plan.
Now the whole world is watching,
it's the perfect time
for your manifesto.
And then you stop.
If they catch you now, they will
silence the whole thing.
I'll think it over.
Think?
There's nothing to think about!
I know these people, I’m
surrounded by those psychopaths
all day long.
I know how they think,
don't underestimate them.
Is it connected to the internet?
No. I checked.
Baldvin, it is secure.
I know what I’m doing.
You can never be sure.
Are you ready?
Yes.
We flip the page.
Cool car.
Yes.
You know who owns it?
No, no idea.
These are criminal activities
and those organized crimes
against the Icelandic nation
will be met with full force.
The negotiations with the
Chinese are momentarily on hold.
The government is determined
to continue
its industrial development.
The government's statement has
attracted the attention
of the media.
In Germany they speak about
the Green Army and the BBC...
It’s scandalous
that the government isn't
admitting this is sabotage.
It’s an attack on the heavy
industry in Iceland.
Nobody will want to invest
in our industry in the future.
Speaking.
Yes, good afternoon.
A letter? No, I haven't received
any letter.
I had made an application,
but it was 4 years ago.
I'll double-check the mail.
Let me see...
Wait, I'll check
in another place...
Oh, my God.
A girl...
Yes, I have it here.
I have to note it down.
Tomorrow morning?
Yes, I will remember. at 11?
And so...
How old is she?
So, 4 years old...
Yes, it's written here.
Thank you. See you.
Yes, I have to look at this...
I haven't thought about it
for 4 years now.
You don't have much time
to think it over.
We need an answer soon.
If you're not adopting, we need
to find another candidate.
Yes, I understand.
So much has changed since then.
Here is the folder
with all the information
from the Ukrainian institute.
If you accept, you need
to provide the following papers:
a recent criminal record,
a bill of health
and a statement
that you are still single.
Yes, it's still the case.
So we need a new signature
from your back-up custodian.
The form is right here.
Presumably
it's still your sister?
Yes.
And you will still be her
back-up
if her application goes through?
What?
She also has
an application pending.
You both applied at the same
time, if I recall?
Yes, nothing has changed,
but I’m not so sure...
- I can't answer for her.
- I understand.
Very well. So here it is...
You have a photo of the little
girl and some information.
She's from the Donetsk region,
from a town called Drouj...
...kivka.
She lost both her parents
in the war.
She was found
with her grandmother,
who had been dead for some days.
So there is
some trauma
that needs to be taken care of.
But she is clearly
a little hero.
Very good.
Now we lie back.
And we release
all the weight of our body
to Mother Earth.
I need to talk to you.
Me too. In a bit.
We relax...
We breathe in the light.
We breathe out.
We trust...
- I’m waiting in the garden.
- I come in 5 minutes.
- Can I begin?
- Yes.
They changed the rules.
The rules have changed,
and a little girl is waiting
in Ukraine.
We are not too old in Ukraine.
Not anymore.
How wonderful!
I knew there was something
going on.
I’ve been dreaming of you
lately, as if something
very important was going
to happen
and now it has happened.
My dear Halla,
you're going to be a mom.
You too,
we applied at the same time,
you must be next in line.
I also have big news for you.
I’ve been accepted into the
Maharishi Ashram in India.
- What? With the gurus?
- Yes.
I'll have the guidance
of Tony Nader,
I will be away for two years.
Totally secluded from the world.
You're joining a convent?
You could say that.
But we...
You are my back-up custodian.
I can be the auntie abroad
until I come home.
What's her name?
You have a photo?
She's holding a flower.
She looks just like you.
And you.
She looks just like us.
Her name is Nika.
She's alone in the world.
She lost everything in the war.
Her mom, her dad, her grandma.
Nika, daughter of Halla.
It’s just that...
It’s all so complicated now.
What do you mean?
What is complicated?
Tell me.
I think I need help.
We all need to find
our own path.
My journey is an inner one,
to face myself.
Your journey will be to Ukraine
to this little girl.
Will you sign the form again?
What?
The papers saying that you are
my back-up custodian.
Of course I will sign.
But you don't need anyone else.
You know that you can do it.
You're the mom
and nothing will stop you.
What did Mom always say?
Say it.
Moms can do anything.
No, the other thing.
- Find solutions.
- Exactly.
THE ALUMINUM SMELTER
OUT OF POWER
FOREIGN TERRORIST OPERATION?
THE CIA HELPS THE POLICE
A NATION KEPT HOSTAGE
DECLARATION
Are you looking for something?
No, nothing special today.
You're always welcome.
Goodbye.
I’ve got to run. See you later.
You're always welcome.
I declare that I’m solely
responsible for the sabotage
enacted upon
the country's power lines.
The world will know
that heavy industry
in Iceland will be costly...
DECLARATION
"I declare...
"that I’m solely responsible...
"that my actions are
only aimed at..."
"The acts of sabotage
are a crime against humanity..."
Good.
"The driving force behind these
hellish acts is not democratic."
No!
"I urge everyone to rise up
"and use their ingenuity
"to cause damage
to these enterprises.
"That's the only thing
those psychopaths,
"those global multinationals,
can understand.
"That's how they operate,
"with threats and sabotage
against nature and society."
- It’s over?
- No, it's...
I got a signal.
Keep on.
"The sabotage against our nature
causing atmospheric warming
"is a crime against humanity
and all life on Earth.
"The globalized industry
"is the force behind
this suicidal charge
"that not even democracy
can stop."
It’s incredible.
"But there are laws..."
You're skipping something.
"There are laws
above human laws,
"ancestral laws which will not
be stricken out tomorrow.
"It’s our indisputable right
to protect the Jives
"of future generations.
"We are the most powerful
generation ever
"and we are also
the last generation
"that can stop
the war against our Earth.
"Our children and grandchildren
will have no chance.
"For them it will be too late.
"Now is the time,
the mission is ours.
"The Mountain Woman."
We can bury this.
How?
I need to make a confession.
I have a secret
I can't keep quiet any longer.
As you know, I have...
I’ve had a dream
for a long time,
but I thought
it would never come true,
until two days ago.
There is a little girl
in Ukraine
who needs a mother,
and the mom happens to be me.
Congratulations!
Her name is Nika.
She's beautiful!
She is 4 years old.
I will go get her next week,
so we need to postpone
our summer concert.
She's going to be a mom!
Who is this tourist?
This is not a joke.
Some American has taken over the
investigation and Israelis too.
They're analyzing the paper.
Why did you use
an old typewriter?
- It can be traced.
- Stop.
No one will trace it.
Why didn't you
Jet me read it before?
I just had to get it out,
the timing was crucial.
And then the girl came...
But there are weak points
they will tear apart.
- Like what?
- The laws about laws...
You're opening up
a very dangerous angle,
they will totally deform it.
People will understand.
I’ve planted the seeds,
it can't be stopped.
They don't want to stop it,
but to control it. They will
control the discussion.
What will be discussed?
The real issues.
Who will tell us
what the real issues are?
They've started
a mole investigation.
The ministry is out of the loop.
Are you a suspect?
I don't know.
Everybody is a suspect.
I can't anymore,
I just can't do it anymore.
If they identify me,
they will identify you.
- We are too close.
- We will stop it.
- I promise.
- You have to leave.
Please leave.
It’s clear that
there will be cuts in wages
because of this Mountain Woman.
It’s an attack
on wage-earning people.
The Bank of Iceland projects
a plunge in its credit rating.
It will be rated at the bottom
if energy isn't delivered.
Hydraulic energy is
very ecological.
Nothing makes sense.
We will emit
less greenhouse gases.
All this violence...
Democracy is
the principal issue.
There are laws superior
to human laws.
What are those? Divine laws?
Or sharia laws?
Do we have to stop all industry
and go back to our turf houses?
You don't answer the phone?
I forgot it at home.
Will you bring her some clothes?
Yes.
What size?
I don't know.
She's 97cm and 22 kilos.
Tiny little creature.
She wouldn’t touch
the bottom of the pool.
Mommy!
Hello!
Sirrý!
So you were in the locker?
Come here.
How old are you?
4 years old.
4 years old?
You have nice little feet.
Can I see?
And her shoe size?
25 - 26.
They grow fast at this age.
Yes, it's true.
Yes, really.
Children's shoes
are so expensive,
and it will get worse
with this Mountain Woman.
Yes, it's sad.
It’s dreadful.
What's dreadful?
This violence.
This violence?
It’s just sabotage.
Just sabotage?
Economic sabotage.
It’s extremism,
which breeds extremism.
He who Jives by the sword,
dies by the sword.
But no one has been hurt,
except our country
and our planet.
It’s not the right way
to solve this problem.
Meditating in some convent,
will that change something?
It will change me
and thus the world I hope.
Isn’t that egoism, to think
it will change the world?
The drop hollows the stone.
The stone?
The mountains are falling on us,
we don't have time
to wait for drops.
Now you're going to save a child
and the entire world with it.
Isn’t that a small drop
or is it just vanity?
At least I’m doing something
for someone else.
We must not let
this kind of terror
turn our society into a jungle
where the strongest steer
the course.
That's the main issue.
Mr Prime Minister,
what are your projects
concerning global warming?
It's the reason
for these acts of sabotage.
We will not discuss
the environmental issues
until we know how
to tackle this violence
as a nation.
That is the main issue.
The most important
is that we rally behind
the democratic ideal.
That is precisely what Al-Qaeda
and Isis suggest
and are doing.
But an example close to home
is of course Anders Breivik
who in this context
is the Norwegian Mountain King.
Those technical changes will
enable us to safeguard against
an electricity outage
and increase the power
of electricity transport.
So there will be no way
to knock out a smelter
and hold
an entire nation hostage.
Not only do the negotiations
with the Chinese go on
but Rio Tinto will enlarge
its aluminum smelter.
The country is rising again!
Thank you!
I need more of those,
six indoor plants
and 25kg of chicken manure
to put in the trunk,
please.
Chicken manure.
According to the Blönduóa police,
there was a break in
at the Road Administration
storage last night.
A great quantity of Semtex
was stolen.
The Civil Protection
have issued an alert
of possible sabotage
and has put up road blocks.
People are urged to call
the police
if they see something unusual
but not to engage suspects
as they might be armed
and dangerous.
Where are you going?
It’s a secret.
A flowery, surprise birthday
present for my cousin.
Who is your cousin?
Sveinbjörn Ásmunds...
Ásmundsson.
From Brùsastaðir in Þingvallasveit.
Sveinbjörn, I know him.
Really?
- You two are related?
- Yes.
Can you open the trunk?
I know what it is.
Mea culpa.
I know!
You can't offer flowers
without fertilizer.
Go right ahead.
So I’m free to go?
Great! Thank you!
Shut up!
What's wrong?
What are you trying to say?
THANK YOU
You're under arrest!
Pick up!
Pick up signal at 2 o’clock.
Negative.
Wait! There!
Is something there?
Negative.
Another bloody sheep!
They're everywhere.
They must stop them
from running all over the place.
Come, we don't have much time.
Thanks.
You're not out of this yet.
How did you find me?
I know my land,
I figured you'd come down here.
I’m freezing.
Here.
Squeeze down in the middle.
They're down there.
When they stop us, don't move.
Woman!
Come here!
Come in the car!
Where are you heading?
I wanted to bring some sheep up
there, but I had to turn back.
Woman!
You're making a hell of a noise!
Not thinking about the animals.
This grazing land
has been used for 1000 years.
You don't have the right
to scare the livestock,
just for fun.
Come!
Nobody's having fun here.
Really?
So you will herd them up
when they've run back
because of your mess?
We won't keep you.
If you see something...
Over my dead body.
Why would I patrol the land
they've taken from me?
Get out of here!
The foreign national
arrested two days ago
has been released today,
as it's considered his
involvement was impossible.
The police are still pursuing
the suspects...
Good morning.
Good morning.
Is Halla here?
Yes, she...
She is taking a shower.
I understand...
Would you like to...
come in and wait?
No... no.
Can you give this to her?
It’s clothes and shoes
for the little girl.
I will call later.
I’m Ása.
Her sister.
Sveinbjörn.
A picture of little Nika.
Oh, yes...
Nika?
Yes, she's from Ukraine.
She looks like you,
and your sister.
She brought you this packet
for Nika.
They are hard workers,
Ukrainian men...
and women.
You know where to find me.
You're welcome
with the little girl.
She has to meet her cousin.
Her alleged cousin.
You are my cousin,
and you will be our cousin.
Have a nice trip!
Thank you.
Do you know what's going on?
They're taking DNA samples.
The internet is on fire
about this.
Have you seen this?
It’s incredible.
You can stop searching!
She's been arrested.
Who?
The Mountain Woman.
It’s some yoga teacher.
She looks a bit like you.
Downtown?
Yes.
Everything is going crazy.
The terrorist they caught
is some madwoman,
some bohemian artist.
We're looking for Halla Benediktadóttir,
Choir conductor and musician.
Halla is 49, 176cm tall.
She's slim with short dark hair.
Those who might know
her whereabouts...
Where are you coming from?
Ukraine.
I didn't know
there were flights from there.
I have to throw up.
Good girl!
THE MOUNTAIN WOMAN WAS ALONE
Well...
Her custody is over.
We're moving her to a cell.
She has a visitor.
You just press the button here
and we'll come.
You have one hour.
Close the door.
Thank you for the clothes.
Are they okay?
Yes, I think.
I should have told you.
No, then I would have been
an accomplice.
I’ve never been able
to keep a secret.
Now I understand why you asked
me to be there for the child.
I don't want to talk about it.
Now you stay here
and you will turn this house,
this prison,
into your haven,
your convent, your temple.
I guess that's right.
You stay here,
but I, your sister Ása,
I’m going to Ukraine.
What?
I spoke to the adoption agency.
I was next in line.
I’ve taken care of everything,
I’ve prepared new papers,
they are in a bag
in the car outside.
I’m ready to go
to Ukraine,
to become Nika's mother.
But the convent and the guru?
I’ve decided this.
Your journey is now my journey.
And I go straight
to the airport.
- But...
- But you, Halla...
You will stay here
in this convent,
your ashram,
and practice your meditation.
Halla!
You must trust me.
We have a few seconds
before the camera turns on.
What's going on?
Our cousin just knocked out
all the power in South Iceland.
Our cousin?
Alleged cousin.
Bring Nika home,
we will help each other
when I leave my convent.
We end this visit
for security reasons.
Namaste.
What does that mean?
I greet your inner,
not your outer,
not your appearance,
but your inner being,
who is holy and good.
Namaste.
My name is Nika.
My name is Halla.
Look...
a dog.
The dog.
The engine is soaked,
we need to walk.
