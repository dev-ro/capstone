Should I make joke
about my mother-in-law?
Yes, in America, that's a very popular joke.
Do you have a mother-in-law joke?
- Yes.
- All right.
I had sexy time
with my mother-in-law.
- A what time?
- Sexy time.
I made-a sexy time
with my mother-in-law.
- You had sex with your mother-in-law?

Uh, I don't think that Americans
would find that funny.
No, it is not a joke.
Yeah, we're talking about,
um, humor.
Oh, yes, you asked me
about my mother-in-law.
Do you have a joke
about your mother-in-law?
No, why make a joke
on a mother-in-law?
Um-
Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?
Here in America, we try not to...
make fun of or be funny with things
that people don't choose.
But perhaps you have not seen, um...
someone with a very funny retardation.
My brother Bilo...
have a very funny, uh, retardation.
Um, in mental retardation, you know...
it causes a lot of pain and hardship
for a lot of families.
Sometime my sister,
she show her vagine...
to my brother, Bilo, and say...
"You will never get this.
You will never get this. La-la-la-la-la."
He, uh, behind his cage, crazy, crazy.
Everybody laugh.
She go, "You never get this."
Uh, but one time he break cage
and he get this.
And then we laugh. High five.
Now, um-
Um, no, that would not be funny
in America, okay?
What is a "not" jokes?
A "not" joke is when we're trying
to make fun of something...
and what we do is, we make a statement
that we pretend is true...
but at the end, we say "not,"
which means it's not true.
So teach me how to make one.
- All right. What color is your suit?
- This suit is gray.
Gray. I would call it blue, okay?
- It's gray.
- All right, it's blue-gray.
- But it's certainly not black, right?
- Well, it's more gray.
- All right, let's say it's gray. But it's not-
- It is gray.
Okay, so a "not" joke, I would say...
"That suit is black. Not!"
This-a suit is not black.
- No, no, "not" has to be the end. Okay.
- Okay.
This suit is black not.
This suit is black. Pause.
You know what a pause is?
- Yes.
- This suit is black. Not!
This suit is black, pause, not.
No, you don't say "pause."
This suit is black.
That's a pause. Not!
This suit is black.
Okay, um-
- I don't- I don't- I'm not-
- Not!
Everybody say U.S.A. television
much better...
but this I watch for three hours,
do not change.
There's a remote control right here.
You push these two arrows
to change the channel.
I got him! I got him!
Would you come out in the backyard with me?
I have the urge to bury something else.
Yes!
- I love you.
- Oh, I love you too, Jamie.
Oh, I love you.
Do you believe in magic, um, miss-
Parker. C.J.
It's a pleasure to meet you, C.J.
Be careful! Be careful, C.J...!
This C.J. was like no Kazakh woman
I had ever seen.
She had golden hairs...
teeth as white as pearls...
and the asshole of a seven-year-old.
For the first time in my lifes...
I was in love.
Okay.
In Kazakhstan, it is illegal...
for more than five woman
to be in the same place...
except for in brothel
or in grave.
In U.S. and A., many womens
meet in a groups called feminists.
I find-a more. Chenquieh.
So what-a means, this "feminism"?
It's the theory that women
should be equal to men...
in matters economic-
- social and political.
- Now, you are laughing.
- Yeah.
- That is the problem.
Do you think a woman
should be educate?
Definitely.
But is it not a problem that the woman
have a smaller brain than the men?
That is wrong.
But the government scientist, Dr. Yamak,
have prove it is size of squirrel.
- Your government scientist?
- Yes, Dr. Yamak.
He's wrong. He's wrong.
Give me a smile, baby. Why angry face?
Well, what you're saying
is very demeaning.
- Do you know the word "demeaning"?
- No.
We are saying to you-
I could not concentrate
on what this old man was saying.
They should get paid-
All I could think about
was this lovely woman...
in her red water panties.
Who was this C.J.?
Last night I see, in my hotel room...
um, a woman called C.J. on television.
- Do you know her?
- No.
She-a from a town called Baywatches.
- She's just on television.
- Her name is Pamela.
Do she live here in New York City?
- No, no, no.
- She lives in California.
Oh, in California.
- He's gonna look her up.
- Okay, are we finished now?
Listen, pussycat, smile a bit.
All right. That's it.
- I'm done.
- Okay, we're finished. We have to leave.
Although I was obsessed by this C.J...
I could not pursue her...
or else my wife
would snap off my cock.
- Mr. Sagdiyev?
- Yes?
Uh, I have a telegram for you.
Uh, you can read?
Yes, I can.
Uh, it's "Dear Borat Sagdiyev...
"your wife, OK- Oksana...
"was walking your retarded Bilo
in the woods...
"when a bear attacked
and violated and break her.
She is now dead."
Uh, you saying my wife is dead?
This is what it-
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.
Uh, yes, sir.
I'm sorry to inform you,
but that's what the telegram says.
High five. Great.
Eventually, I persuade Azamat...
that we would travel to California...
and make our reportings
along the way.
He insist we not fly...
in case the Jews repeated
their attack of 9/11.
My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your driving
instructor. Welcome to our country, okay?
- My name-a Borat.
- Okay, okay. Good, good.
I'm not used to that, but that's fine.
- Now, you do know how to drive a little bit?
- Yes.
Yes. Put it in "D."
- What?
- Drive.
Now, wait a second. Wait a second.
Have you driven a car before?
- Yes, many times.
- Okay, all right. Let's go this way.
Wait a minute. I don't want you
to go hitting anybody.
Use two hands, now.
- What?
- Two hands.
But then it look like I am holding
a gypsy while he eat my khram.
I don't care what it looks like.
You use two hands when you drive, okay?
Okay.
Okay.
- Watch the children.
- Okay, no problem.
You must not hit the children.
Look, there is a woman in a car!
Can we follow her and maybe
make a sexy time with her?
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Not yet, huh? Why not?
Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.
- What?
- How about that? Isn't that amazing?
- You joke?
- There must be consent.
How about that?
That's good, huh?
- Is not good for me.
- No, it is good.
- Steer the car.
- Okay.
- Want to have a drink?
- You can't drink that while you're driving.
- It's against the law.
- Why not? What?
Who is this car that follow us?
I wish it didn't follow us anymore.
- Oh, I don't know.
- Maybe we lose them.
No, we better not lose them.
- Hey, don't look at me. Eat my tits!
- All right.
We'll make a right turn up here.
- Don't look at me like that! I will eat your shit.
- Hey, don't do that.
- You fuck my mother.
- Hey, hey. You can't do that.
- No, he do before. He look on me.
- You can't do that, okay?
- They're gonna throw us in jail,
me with you. You can't-
- Why in a jail?
He look on me- la-la-la- behind.
You can't say that.
- I like you. Do you like me?
- I do like you.
- You are my friend?
- You're a nice young man, and I am your friend.
- You will be my boyfriend.
- Well- I won't be your boyfriend.
- Why not? You do not like me?
- I can be. It depends.
Boyfriend-yeah, I can.
Great success.
Now time to make purchase
of motor cars.
I want to have a car that attract
a woman with a shave down below.
Well, that would be
a Corvette or a Hummer.
We will try to help you out here.
A man yesterday tell me
if I buy a car...
I must buy one with a pussy magnet.
He means a car that women will like.
- Yes, but where you keep this magnet?
- No, there's no magnet.
That was just-
He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.
- Do this have a pussy magnet?
- No.
The vehicle itself will be a magnet.
If I give you good price...
will you please put in pussy magnet?
Yeah, but there's-there's no such thing
in this country as a- as a... magnet.
If this car drive
into a group of gypsy...
will there be any damage to the car?
It depends on how hard
you hit them and all that.
- Hard.
- It's hard to s-Yeah, hard?
If somebody rolls on the windshield,
they could crack your windshield.
How fast do I need to go
to guarantee I kill him?
Let me tell you something.
With this vehicle here, probably doing
35, 40 miles an hour would do it.
- Great.
- Okay.
- When I buy my wife-
- Mm-hmm.
um, at the start, she was cook good...
her vagine work well,
and she strong on plow.
But after three years,
once she was 15...
then she become weak.
Her voice become-a deep.
"Borat, Borat."
She receive hair on chest...
and her vagine hang
like sleeve of wizard.
Huh. Geez.
- How do I know that this
will not happen with the car?
- Geez.
Chevrolet guarantees you that
with a warranty.
I like-a very much buy this Hummers.
- How much is it?
- 52,000.
I am looking for something...
between, um, $600 to $650.
We don't have any cars

I might be able to sell you
a wholesale car...
a car with a lot of miles
for 700 with no warranty.
- Okay.

Then they say,
"I wash you in a shower"...
and he wash me in a shower.
It sounds like you

what is called in America
"the gay community."
- What it mean, "gay," this word "gay"?
- Homosexual.
A homosexual? You mean-
Are you telling me the man who tried
to put a rubber fist in my anus...

Even though my anus was broken...

"Pamela is a fairly simple girl.
"She recently explained...
"'There's not a whole lot of logic...
"'in the way I live my life.
I am very spontaneous."'
I'm very spontaneous too.
I needed a gift to give to Pamela...
so that she would grant me entry
into her vagine.
Therefore, I convinced Azamat...
to let me film a report
in an American store.
Uh, this your shops?
Right. This is my antique shop.
Why do you have so many things with a flag?
We're honoring our heritage.
And what, uh, in here?
What is this?
These are a number of collectibles.
I mean, this is a- this is a lamp that,
you know, you would use in your home.
This is a Chinese cloisonné bell.
And this is a-just a, uh-
a little decorative duck.
And do you think, um,
you know, when they-
I'm sorry. Wait. Wait.
- We need help, baby.
- No, it's okay.
I sorry.
Sorry. I will, uh, repair all of this.
Don't worry.
My friend, he can make glue.
I don't think you're gonna be able
to glue that stuff back.
I think you're gonna have to pay for it.
Okay, I have digital watch from future.
I will give you.
Is worth more than all of this.
You broke $425 worth of stuff.
160, 170, 180.
That's not enough.
Do you want hair?
This is very good-
No, I don't want any damn hair.
This is the best hair in Kazakhstan.
Feel the quality.
- I don't want your damn hair. We don't-
- This hair from pubis.
I can get you, uh, 2,000 bags
by next Friday.
We don't use that stuff in this country.
Just give me another 20.
That's good enough.
Would you have believed this
if I had told you?
- All right, go! Go! Go!
- Okay?
Oh! Holy sheeze. Ow.
Okay. Um-
Um-
We have a special guest here this evening.
Uh, Ruth Feiner is here.
What are you doing? Come on. Cut it out!
- Just walk 'em out.
- Get the fuck out of here!
So, um, bad news.
Azamat have, uh, leave.
I wake up, he disappear...
and he take... Oksana...
my bear- our bear.
And he also decide to take all money...
and also my passport.
And, um...
he leave me...
only this bag...
with a hen...
and, uh...
ticket to Kazakhstan...
but no passport.
But at least he's, uh...
man enough to leave me, uh...
my beautiful...
uh, which I, uh, have cleaned
since last night.
And, uh, I have decide...
to continue making documentary.
Make it without Azamat.
I think will be better,
and I will have more success...
without him.
Chenquieh.
Uh, I only want 17 cents, please.
I had no car, no money and no Azamat.
The only thing keep me going
was my dream...
of one day holding Pamela
in my arms...
and then making romance explosion
on her stomatch.
Eventually,
I managed to hike hitchings...
with group of young scholars
also traveling across country.
High five!

I got good news:
Jesus is God in the flesh!
I don't care what the devil's done to you
or what he's trying to do.
All you gotta do is step out
of that aisle now...
and make your way
down to this altar.
Let's have a little
old-time church right now.
I need somebody to pray with me
right now. Come on, sir!

So I forgave Azamat.
Mmm.
Oh, Pamela.

Pamela! I am not attracted
to you anymore.
Not!
I was humiliated.
It was time for me
to return to New York...
where a ticket was waiting for me
to fly back home.
While I sat on the bus, I thought of
my journey over the past three weeks:
the great times, the good times...
and the shit times.
Mainly, they were shit times.
I had come to America
to learn lessons for Kazakhstan.
But what had I learned?
Suddenly, I realized.
I had learned
that if you chase a dream...
especially one with plastic chests...
you can miss the real beauty
in front of your eyes.
Hi.
Welcome back in my town of Kuzcek.
Since I return, there have been
much improvements.
We no longer have
a Running of the Jew.
It's cruel. We Christians now.
Doltan improve too. Hey, Doltan.
High five.
Great.
Come my house.
There lives Nursultan Tulyakbay.
He's still asshole.

He only get iPod Mini.
Everybody know it for girls!
