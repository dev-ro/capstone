Come on! All aboard!
- Get on the train, Lieutenant!
- Right away.
Come on! Come on! Aboard!
All aboard!
Where were you? The train's leaving.
l know. l was at the doctor's.
Clemens, we're going to have a baby.
Lisa.
Daddy, will you send me a postcard?
l will.
Promise?
l promise.
A promise is a promise
that you never break.
No, l won't.
Last call, Lieutenant! All aboard!
Come on! All aboard!
l'll be back soon.
l promise.
l'll be back for Christmas!
As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me
Clemens Forell is hereby charged
with violating paragraphs 31 9 and 320.
The Court will now
pronounce judgement on him.
The defendant is guilty
of crimes against the Partisans.
He is sentenced.
to 25 years of forced labor.
The sentence is in effect
starting today, 1 3 July 1 945.
Forell!
lt's your turn.
Everybody turn around!
He won't let go! He wont' let go!
Hey, kid! It's me!
He won't hurt you now. He's dead.
Hello, Lisa.
l have something for you today.
Here... And now l get a kiss.
What a little hussy!
Mommy!
Lisa.
A letter from Clemens?
From the Red Cross:
We have no record of Clemens Forell
in our lists.
There is no information
about the Russian court martial.
They know nothing.
Nothing!
Everything will turn out all right...
Hail Mary... Mother of mercy.
Please, bring my father back home.
Daddy!
Hey, Danhorn.
You were at the divisional headquarters.
And you made maps.
Yeah, and this is my reward.
Where's Cape Dezhnev?
Don't know much about geography, huh?
Okay...
Here... from north to south...
The Ural Mountains.
To the west...
... that trivial place
we can now forget about: Europe.
The Irtysh River... is behind us.
We much be here now.
Further east near the Yenisey River.
The Lena...
... the Vitim... the little Olekma.
By the way, here everything is little
if it's shorter than 1 ,OOO kilometers.
Cape Dezhnev
Yes, well... It's further east
northeast.
lt will take ages to get there.
We'll never get there.
They'll let us starve
and freeze to death first.
Maybe we don't deserve any better.
We did our duty.
You were in the SA.
And l'm proud of it!
Stop it! Have you gone crazy?
- That's your last order, Captain!
- Hands off!
Four pieces each. Less than usual.
Clemens, we're going to have a baby!
l'll be back for Christmas!
l said four pieces, bastard!
Why do they get fed first?
You'll all get fed here! Understand?
What about the main course, Captain?
You won't have anything
to laugh about soon.
They're gonna let us die.
They uncoupled us, so we'll die.
Mother, pray for me. Don't let me die.
They're gonna let us die.
They're gonna shoot us.
They gotta shoot us.
Shut your fucking mouth! Nothing to eat!
Come on, kid! Pull yourself together!
My mother's last letter... gives me strength.
Hide it under your lapel.
Don't let them find it.
Try to sleep.
- What's going on?
- l don't know.
They've come for us.
They're taking us away.
Where to?
November, somewhere in Siberia.
This letter will never reach you.
lt will never be sent.
l can't even write it.
l can hardly gather my thoughts
of what l want to say.
l saw that huge screeching wheel.
That terrible thing
which crushes everything.
But l also realize
that no pain is irrevocable.
But constant hope is.
Cape Dezhnev Prison Camp, 1 946
Headquarters
You saved the company.
You crossed the front line.
That's why you got a medal.
- You'll have a drink?
- No, thank you.
You could serve in the
western region or in Leningrad.
lnstead, you are here in Cape Dezhnev. Why?
Because l feel it's my duty.
The temptations of a woman!
Alright...
You are responsible for camp security.
l hope you'll be able to cope with it.
Thank you for your confidence, Major.
l'll do my best.
Barracks!
We made it!
Typhoid.
We can't go on like this.
We have penicillin. l know.
We got it from the Americans.
So, give it to me!
l'm warning you, Dr. Stauffer.
You're going to be responsible
if an epidemic breaks out!
Don't tell me what l'm responsible for!
Don't forget who's in charge here!
You're needed to exam the prisoners.
We aren't finished, Lieutenant.
The Commander's orders.
And l'm here to carry them out.
- You're Dr. Stauffer?
- Yes, sir, Lieutenant!
You accompany Dr. Pachmutova.
There's a lot of work to do.
No fence! No watchtowers!
They don't need things like that
north of the Arctic Circle.
Where would you go anyw, ay?
No trees, no bushes
not even a blade of grass to eat.
214,  21 5, 21 6.
A ship!
We're here at the eastern cape.
There must be a harbor around here.
Let's start again!
lt's very tedious, Dr. Stauffer.
But there is one great advantage.
This way we'll find out
who's healthy and fit for work.
- Then you don't need us.
- Yes, l do.
For the death certificates.
My letter.
Quiet!
What are you hiding?
Just a letter.
From my mother.
Take off all your clothes!
What are you doing?
Giving my coat to my comrade.
What are you doing?
So he doesn't freeze to death.
May l say something, Lieutenant?
No.
What's your name?
Clemens Forell.
Clemens Forell...
Keep your coat. You'll need it.
Keep going, Forell.
What's wrong?
l gotta get out. l can't take this anymore.
l can't stand it!
Go out and join Mattern!
And you'll get your fresh air!
What? Are these our sleeping quarters?
- They'll be deloused.
- They'll be deloused.
We're supposed to take everything off.
- l think this is mine.
- It's mine!
Let go!
The National Committe of Free Germany.
Everyone who joins the right side
will get his chance.
- Forell, right?
- Clemens Forell.
- What's wrong?
- Daddy isn't dead.
No, Lisa. l'm sure he isn't.
Sorry, nothing.
l don't have any information.
That doesn't mean he's dead.
New negotiations with the Russians
will take place this autumn.
You have to wait.
Wait.
Damn light!
Danhorn! My God!
- Prisoner Forell!
- He's dead!
Comrade Lieutenant!
The engineer isn't here.
And that guy is too stupid.
Are you being treated well?
l'm not complaining, but...
Fine.
Come on. Get the machine to work.
Me? How am l supposed to do that?
You're a mechanic, prisoner Forell.
It's in your file.
You don't mean to say it's wrong?
MS Alaska
Start it.
You speak Russian?
- That isn't mentioned in your file.
- Just a few words.
- Learn the right ones.
- Yeah.
Are you still alive, prisoner Forell?
- Yes.
- Louder!
Yes, sir! Lieutenant Kamenev!
That's fine! Where were you going? Alaska?
The Union of the Soviet Republics...
...had an agreement with
the United States of North America.
Even if you'd managed to escape,
they'd have sent you back.
Attention!
That's fine.
You'll never leave this place.
You're going to be buried here.
All of us.
Go on.
Your comrades are waiting for you.
C'mon, Forell! We're waiting for you!
Stop it! You gotta stop it! Stop it!
They really gave it to you.
l'm not surprised.
They're hungry.
Nothing to eat for five days.
Who's dump enough... to run away
the first chance he gets?
You'll never get out that way.
Will he make it?
He's tough.
Take him to... sick bay.
That's an order.
He's running a high fever.
l hope it isn't typhoid.
Help me.
l have to... l have to write home.
lt will never arrive.
Hi there! Hi there!
- Here, you must eat some good food.
- That's too much. Thank you.
Dear Dad, l want to write you a letter,
but l don't know where to send it.
Mom said that you're in Russia.
But Russia is so big, so far, so far away.
l'd really like to see you again.
Do you know what this is?
These aren't spider webs,
like Pachmutova says.
There aren't any spiders here, only lead.
- What do you mean?
- It causes lead poisoning.
Typesetters are advised
to find a new profession.
- And there's nothing you can do?
- No.
Everybody gets it sooner or later.
l gotta go home.
Listen to me... Forell.
- You could make it.
- But how?
You have to be prepared.
You need the right clothes,
sturdy shoes, a compass.
How will you find food?
What if you run into other people?
How do you start a fire at 40 below?
- l know it's possible.
- Be quiet!
You don't know a thing.
lf you reach the Lena within a year,
you can kneel down and thank God.
The Lena is in the middle of Siberia.
Yeah.
l can help you.
- Reuter?
- Fit for work.
Baier?
Fit for work.
Klugmann?
l cleaned everything. You see?
Everything's clean.
Spiders don't have a chance here.
Fit for work.
As soon as you get up...
Fever.
Penicillin.
- He's fit for work.
- No.
- l think so!
- He has a fever!
You don't decide, Dr. Stauffer.
l'm responsible here.
l'm responsible for who gets admitted
and who gets released.
Fit for work.
Come see me tonight.
- Any problems?
- No. okay.
Come here.
Danhorn drew this map
while he was still alive.
Of course, it might not be precise.
A river that runs like this
can change its course.
The rivers are frozen in the winter
but they're like an ocean in the summer.
You'll have to wait for the next winter...
Get in there!
Do you need me, Lieutenant?
You work too long, Dr. Stauffer.
- Why don't you... have a swig.
- Thanks.
Thank you. It hits the spot.
Where did you get this?
Approved by Command Headquarters.
l need it to cut splints
for fractured bones.
We're out of everything.
Don't work any longer tonight.
- Turn off the light.
- Yeah.
- Good night.
- Good night.
We were lucky. There's no time left.
l can't tell you everything.
Come here. My sweater. The boots.
Wear everything during the day.
Take some things off at night,
and loosely cover yourself with them.
Come on, let's get started.
- You have to show me just how...
- Do you want to escape? Yes or no?
- Of course l do!
- But only today! Now!
lf you don't leave tonight, you'll go
back in the mine and never come out!
l've hidden supplies on the hill
where the train goes past.
Dried bread and lard
two kilos of machorka!.
Don't smoke it. You'll need it for trading.
A spirit cooker, a compass.
Snow shoes, too.
Where did you get all that?
lt was actually for my escape.
Here.
Carry it under you clothing.
Right next to your belly.
lt's loaded. Eight spare bullets.
They'll shoot you on the spot
if they find you with it.
Why don't you escape yourself?
There's a danger of losing your voice.
Talk to yourself.
Talk to trees if you have to.
Take this along with you, too.
l scratched my address on it.
From my wife in Magdeburg.
Tell her l prepared everything
for my escape.
Yeah. Why don't l escape?
Two months ago, l stopped fooling myself.
Cancer.
l just have one request, Forell.
If you make it back,
go see my wife.
Tell her that l sent you, and tell her...
....that l died in the winter of '50.
February.
Describe the grave to her.
Tell her...
Tell her there's a cross on my grave.
No, wait... Tell her it was May.
She'll picture it with flowers.
That'll be more like spring.
Promise me?
Yeah, okay... don't forget the map.
Here, take the knife with you.
l don't need it anymore.
You have a head start
till tomorrow morning. It's not enough.
They'll look for you to the west.
Go north to the sea and along the coast.
lt's safer!
Come on, please.
l beg you.
- Excuse me.
- l beg you. Wait.
Please, allow me. l'll take care of it.
You see, that's what the German does.
He'll take care of it.
He's glad that he can work.
And the two of us can...
l'm warning you.
l'm warning you! If you don't stop
flirting with the Germans,
- especially with that Forell...
- What?
What? Maybe you two
already have something going!
Stauffer! Stand up when l talk to you!
Get up!
Get up, bastard!
Get to work!
Only if my men get something decent
to eat. Or we won't work.
You know who's to blame.
You're blaming us, too. That isn't fair.
You talk about fairness!
Yes.
You can kill us all
but we will never beat
one of our comrades again.
Lieutenant, the search patrol reports back.
What do you have to report?
We combed the plains to the west.
All the way to the foothills.
He couldn't have gone that far.
We've been gone for five days.
We're completely exhausted.
l believe he's buried under the snow.
You are expected to carry out orders!
You failed to do the job! Go on!
You've lost control over the camp.
You didn't fulfill your duty.
One of them escaped.
You shot one.
That is sabotage.
He put up resistance.
Okay, let's assume that's right.
And Forell may have frozen to death.
Write that in your report.
No... he isn't dead.
Our Father... who art in Heaven...
Give us our daily bread...
My bread... give me it now!
l'm sorry, but l need your fat.
l have to go home.
997, 998, 999...
3,OOO
O01 , O02, O03, O04...
You're... you're a tree! A tree!
You're a tree!
l'm gonna make it!
l'm gonna make it.
Have all stations been informed?
Yes, without a radius of 500 kilometers.
lncrease the radius.
He can go further than
500 kilometers in two months.
Drop your guns!
lt's all right.
We don't want anything from you.
We easily could have shot you already.
But we're hunters and gold-diggers.
ln the summer, we wash gold.
And in the winter, we hunt.
We saw the fire.
And we thought we'd take a look.
You must be German. And you ran away?
lt will be light soon.
A snowstorm is approaching.
You must look for a safe place.
We know a safe place.
Come on. Let's go.
l don't need you two. Go away.
Go away!
Whatever you say. Let's go!
Anastas!
What's taking you?
So, you still don't believe us?
l'm Semyon. What's your name?
Pjotr.
Right. Don't trust anybody.
And never tell anyone your real name.
Come with us.
You'll never make it alone in Siberia.
lt's becoming spring, Lisa.
l'm on my way to you.
Should l thank God for that
or my Siberian companions?
lt's just a small piece
of the way l have to go.
Semyon said it was 1 O,OOO verst,
and then he laughed.
Semyon is always laughing.
When will we reach
the Kalyma Mountains?
ln two days, maybe in three.
But the river flows north.
No, 500 kilometers to the west.
Take me home, Anastas... On this raft.
We're crossing the Caucasians.
You'll make it. If anybody can, he can.
lt would be possible.
But actually you shouldn't leave.
Look around you. How magnificent.
Siberia is!
Fertile and beautiful.
You can be very happy here.
Okay, Pjotr.
You take the oar.
Now show us what you've learned.
Stay to the left!
Anastas! Straight ahead!
Anastas would have let me drown.
Thank you, Petja.
Eat, Pjotr. Eat.
You can eat these leaves.
l'll teach you everything.
Why did you take me with you?
We ran away from the goldmines.
Anastas thought that
you might give us away.
Sooner or later
they'd have caught you anyway.
- But now you're one of us.
- No!
No, l didn't drown!
What should l have done?
Deserted the raft with all our supplies?
- Where's my pack?
- It's gone. It sank.
Hey, it's all here!
What happened to my things?
l thought maybe you had some salt.
We haven't had salt for a long time.
What do you need that for anyway?
There are cities and streets here
that you've never heard of before.
The rivers are being re-routed.
Everywhere they're building,
researching and collectivizing.
That's how it is in the Soviet Union today.
Do you have any salt perhaps?
Didn't you check... to see?
What an idiot l am!
Salt!
Vodka!
Vodka!
What luck, Petruchka! Vodka!
Why did you kill him?
Why do you think?
We have to bury him.
He'll be taken care of now by the wolves.
He wanted to steal my gold.
Listen, Petja.
Take your things and let's go.
We'll get by without him. Come on.
l'm heading home, step by step.
Even if l have to go roundabout ways.
This is what l've learned:
The southern route to the west
goes north sometimes, towards the east.
l'm done with. l can't go on.
We'll make it, Semyon.
We have to go on.
Give me your pack. l'll carry it.
That's very nice of you.
But there's only enough gold for one of us!
For one of us!
Lisa.
lt was just a dream. Just a dream.
Clam down, sweetheart.
l'm thirsty.
- l'll get you something.
- Okay.
Okay! You're talking like a Yankee.
- You dreamed about Daddy again.
- Yes.
lt's me, Kolka!
And that's... Alyoshka!
Prisoner of war...
You talked in your sleep.
This is Irina.
Her grandfather healed you.
He heals everyone who is ill.
But he couldn't help her husband.
The bears tore him apart.
My wife.
My son.
l have to go away.
For a long time, with the dogs.
But don't be afraid.
No one will harm you here.
But you must drink and eat,
so you get your strength back.
- Okay?
- Yes...
l am Clemens.
This is all we know about him.
The keys.
He wanted to buy a passport
with the gold he stole.
- Imagine that, Comrade Kamenev.
- l'm not interested in him.
l need the other man mentioned
in the report, a German.
- Did he talk about the German?
- Yes, sir, Comrade Kamenev.
Ask him yourself if that's
the German you're looking for.
Attention! State Security asks
all residents of Yakutsk for their help.
Be on the lookout for
a German spy named Pjotr.
His real name is Clemens Forell.
Forell, l have a son!
He's my son! Mine!
What a great little guy!
Look how big he is!
He's going to be a real giant!
Do you have a son?
l don't know.
- l hope so.
- You'll find out.
l'm sure you'll find out.
They're looking for you.
lt's too dangerous for you.
l have to go away.
Aljoshka will take you
to the great forests.
And then...
... you'll be on your own.
Thank you for everything.
Argish!
He likes you and will go with you.
He's a good hunting dog,
and a small bone is all he needs.
- Alright... good luck.
- Thank you.
Ringing cedar.
lt will protect you.
The spirit of the shaman is with you.
Go home and... forget my name.
Go now! Go!
Argish, go and look after him.
Summer 1 951
Hey there! Don't move!
Come here! Move it!
- What's your name?
- Answer the Comrade Inspector!
Pjotr Ivanovich. l'm from the Baltic.
My 8 years of forced labor are over.
l have to report to the
Rayon commander of the MWD in...
... Chita. Here.
You have a permit?
No, l don't.
- But... An l.D.?
- Yes...
But it's being sent by courier.
Otherwise l could escape.
With an l.D.
l know all about you bastards.
You know how far it is to Chita?
Far. Very far.
800 kilometers.
- Damn dog!
- He's hungry.
We didn't find much to eat in the forest.
Got out and have them give you some food.
Thank you, Comrade Inspector.
We have to report him.
We will, but first we have
to send off our freight.
You're lucky!
There's a freight train going to Chita.
You're going along as the brakeman.
Make sure no tramps hitch a ride.
You check the chains.
- You understand?
- Yeah.
Let's go!
- Bye!
- Good luck.
Attention!
Comrade Lieutenant
the unit is ready for act'ion!
Commanding officer... Lieutenant Zykov.
- How many men?
- Fifteen.
- Button up your jacket.
- Sorry.
Hey, come on. We're here.
We gotta go!
He isn't here!
At the front of the train!
Be quiet!
Almost on time, Prisoner Forell.
Argish! Stop it!
lt is walled within the ground,
then formed and fired from clay.
Hurry, come around, craftsmen,
the ball must be finished today.
lt is walled within the ground,

Craftsmen, hurry, come around,
the bell must be finished today.
Learn as much as you can.
Keep on learning.
The Wanderer's Night Song
Hush'd on the hill the breeze; Scarce by
the zephyr the trees softly are pressed
The woodbird's asleep on the bough.
Wait then, and thou.
Soon will find rest.
That was very nice. Elisabeth.
Go to your seat.
Who else has memorized a poem?
Rudolf.
Central Asian U.S.S.R., August 1 952
Lord, forgive my sins...
Forgive me.
Wonders will never cease!
A German asks for forgiveness.
You're obvious.
There are lots of poor destitutes here,
but l've never seen
a German destitute here before.
lf you pardon the expression,
you have quite a strong odor.
You can freshen up at my home.
l want to help you.
ls it a long way?
You have trouble walking?
lt's better to take the side streets.
Soviet Police Headquarters
Come with me.
My brothers...
We came from Poland.
l went to the Soviet Union
and they went to Gdansk.
An uncle of ours lived there.
l burned it...
... when l received the news
that... that also...
Take sugar.
Were you in a camp?
Why did you burn the photograph
of your brothers?
Because l can't look them in the eyes.
l'm sorry.
That's easily said.
What shall we do with you now?
You need a passport.
- A passport?
- You can't cross the border otherwise.
Do you have a name
that you've chosen for yourself?
- Pjotr.
- Pjotr.
Pjotr Ivanovich Ulyanov.
That's about as common here
as Hans Peter Muller in Germany.
Why are you doing this for me?
You want to know
why a Jew would help a German?
Although you Germans killed my brothers.
Not all of us knew about it.
Of course not.
You'd have fought
to save women and children.
You'd have killed
your commanding officer instead.
But you didn't know a thing.
They kept it a secret.
You only did your duty.
l'm doing my duty, too.
We'll prepare a bath for you now.
l feel a bit queer.
At least the haircut fits.
Wait here.
lt could take a few hours.
When l leave, l turn off the lights.
Stay here in the dark.
- Try to sleep.
- Alright.
No confidence?
l've learned to be careful.
You have to learn to trust people again.
Your passport and travel permit.
The trip costs nothing.
A Soviet achievement.
Now listen, Pjotr Ivanovich Ulyanov.
You're Latvian. That explains your accent.
Memorize the information.
You have to hurry now.
The meeting place is
at the end of the street.
Why are you doing this for me?
Do you have a bad conscience,
because you didn't help a Jew?
You'll have to sort that out yourself.
Go now. With a little luck, you'll make it.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
l've heard of your hospitality.
May l come in?
Daddy, will you send me a postcard?
This postcard, please.
20 copecks.
We have our suspicions about you.
But no evidence.
But who needs evidence!
You don't think that l'd help a German.
l just have to know where he is.
Understand?
Yes, l helped him.
And l'd to it again.
l'd help anyone. Understand?
There's been a landslide.
You'll have to make a detour.
That'll take us out of our way.
What can l do?
ls it possible to walk there?
Yes, but it's very far.
How did you get here?
There was a landslide in the mountains.
That's why l walked.
You walked?... It's very far.
Yes.
You see... l have to cross the border today.
Here... valid on 1 3 August.
The Iranians probably
won't let me cross tomorrow.
Yes, the Iranians probably
won't let you in.
You can go across.
Thanks.
lt's my victory.
Teheran Federal Prison, December 1 952
We believe that he's a Russian spy.
He'll be sentenced to death.
He calls himself Clemens Forell and says
he escaped from Siberia's eastern shore.
He says it took him 3 years to get here.
lt sounds so incredible
that it might even be true.
That is why l granted his request
and asked you to come and identify him.
The last time l saw him was 1 937.
Before l was appointed to
the Ministry of Economics in Ankara.
We shall find out
if he really is my nephew.
You have my complete support,
Mr. Baudrexel.
Uncle.
Don't you recognize me?
- You claim to be my nephew.
- It's me.
Sit down.
lf you're Clemens Forell...
l'd like you to answer some questions.
Mountain Troop Regiment Reichenhall.
l gave my mother the photograph
for her birthday in '39.
l wrote it on the back.
To my dear mother on her birthday.
1 5 July, 1 939...
Clemens.
