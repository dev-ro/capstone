I went through a period...
when sex had to be violent.
I was desperate to feel something real,.
Nothing felt real.
Every kiss felt like half

What happens to the birds of the air,

You will decide what happens to our world.
You, people, you are the future!
And the future is now!
I think you should tell him...
about us.
We were together
before he even knew us.
Right.
- Are you looking?
- Yes!
Oh, yeah!
That's old. That's been there.
Oh, I was there this summer.
What about a job? You working this year?
I have a few different jobs, you know?
You looking around?
- Yeah, I'm trying.
- Yeah?
You worry about me, Daddy?
I just wanna know what you're doing.
Am I prying too much?
There is someone, but...
I'm not really sure what's gonna happen.
Oh! Okay-
But does he play out, like,
make money playing and stuff'?
- He does'?
- Mm-hmm.
So he's a working musician?
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, well, that's good to hear.
You think I could meet him?
Maybe someday.
Do you trust this man?
You know, we never hear from you.
Your mom and I wanna come up
and visit together sometime.
She really misses you.
We just want you to be happy.
Whatever you're doing.
I know.
Who am I?
I show apartments.
A dog walker.
I thought we could just roll and tumble.
Live from song to song.
Kiss to kiss.
What's that for'?
"X" marks the spot.
I love your soul.
Go, "Ah."
Ah...
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
Let me see.
Can you see my soul?
Is it still there?
What's so funny?
How well do you know this guy?
And how come he's letting you
stay at his place?
You shouldn't trust him.
Why not?
I just think you should be careful.
Ladies and gentlemen...
He said, "Trust me."
- We should make a record together.
- And I did.
I know you do the live music thing
and everything else,
but don't you wanna make some money?
Whatever I wanted,
he'd make it happen.
You've got talent.
You want one of those?
You wanna be me?
Where do you get a jacket like this?
Makes you walk different.
Get you a hundred jackets like that.
How long you lived here?
About two weeks.
I don't like it.
It's all for sale.
All of it...
honors, titles.
This, none of this exists.
What do you see?
Pool?
It's a stage show.
It's all just free fall.
You have too much pride.
I thought pride was a good thing.
People aren't proud enough.
Selfish!
Arrogant! Conceited!
If you know what's good for you,
you will stay as far away
from this man as you possibly can!
People changed around him.
They did things.
So did I.
He leaves us alone this way.
Because he wants to be free.
All his life, he's tried to get free.
He doesn't know how.
You aren't who you think you are.
He doesn't love you.
I like you this way.
I wanted to be free the way he was.
I went on seeing him.
I Let myself be smashed.
You can't?
Well, why can't you?
Do you trust me to stick
your finger in here?
He did everything.
He exhausted every poison.
He knew every form of love,
suffering, madness.
Learn all the rules when you're young,
'cause that makes Mom and Dad happy.
And then throw the fucking
lot of them out the window.
And they want you to!
They want you to!
So that he could reach the unknown.
He experimented.
They scare you with names.
Like wickedness.
You liked it; that I did what I liked.
I pulled you down in the car.
You realize that, um...
you know, it's like the sea.
Things come in and out.
We feel happy and ecstatic.
And then, you know, hours later,
you know, we feel
the deepest sorrows, or...
I didn't believe enough in love.
Afraid it would burn me up.
Be ready to suffer.
Don't be afraid.
I saw my husband.
I saw this boy across the room.
And I loved... I...
I just...
loved him the first moment I saw him.
And we had a life.
And it was beautiful,
and it was difficult.
And I thought I would be
with him for the rest of my life.
But he died.
I wanted to escape from every tie.
Every hold.
To have fife at any price.
Not to settle.
To go up...
Higher.-...

And I failed you.
Or just seem like one

my family.
Is now the time to tell you that?
I guess not.
- Is this a joke?
- She's kidding, ma.
- Oh.
- Oh, it was a joke.
Not very funny.
Cheers.
Excuse me for a second.
You're unhappy-
I can see it.
Sorry about that.
What'd you do?
She's the wrong person for you.
I'm sorry?
It's wrong.
Come on, honey. It's okay.
I don't understand it, but...
- Can I walk with you?
- No.
I don't know how to change.
I want to,.
How do you?
Will you take me somewhere?
How do you get better?
Gotta sacrifice something.
How do you know
when you're lying to yourself?
When you give somebody your word...
does it mean anything?
You can just take it back,.
I told her that Fm gonna do my best.
Do my best not to say things I don't mean.
The world built
a fence around you.
How do you get through?
Connect?
There's something else.
Something that wants us to find it,.
You're the part
that I don't know...
that you don't know yourself.
I swear.
How long have
you been doing this?
My dream was to be a teacher,
but this is kind of something I just...
I fell into after my fiancé passed.
In memory for him, but...
like, this is not something
that people just choose to do,
so I'm trying... this is just
a means to an end for me.
It was
so much better when he was around.
But, you know...
God has a plan, and...
and I guess this is part of his plan.
You know, Shawn being gone
and me being in this situation
where I have no choice
but to do what I do, so...
Eventually, maybe he'll hear
my prayers and I'll be able to...
you know, move forward and do something...
valued with my life.
Something my dad
can be proud of, you know.
Make the money.
Don't let the money make you.
Create the illusion,
but don't let yourself
believe that illusion.
Only make him believe it.
Don't let yourself get caught up in it.
I sell a fantasy, not my body.
I sell an illusion.
I sell, you know...
a daydream to these guys.
And I try to keep the cookie jar closed.
Is that me?
The cookie jar closed.
You burn me.
Who are you?
I can't take this world straight.
Big candy store out there.
- I think I get a little insecure
- What do you like to drink?
And... you know,
I just... I look for comfort...
- in places I shouldn't.
- You like to get high?
I don't know...
It's kind of...
I'm weird,.
- I'm just...
- What's your fantasy?
What turns you on?
I think just
being wanted turns me on.
Tell me what scares you.
I'm really scared of spiders.
Um, but most things don't scare me.
I think I have a thick skin.
I think I'm pretty strong.
No, but what really scares you?
I don't know my family.
No one's ever been there for me but me,.
You like those girls, don't you?
They know what you are.
When I was a girl,
I loved everyone.
You killed my love.
What did I say?
Do?
Mom, I'm afraid of myself.
A hatred in me.
Everything I could do to get free...
goes through my mind.
Makes me evil.
I used to think I could never be wicked,.
Wicked before.
A long way out for me.
So much to seek to be consoled
as to understand,
to be loved as to love.
For it is in giving that we receive.
It is in pardoning...
Bang.
Bang.
Bang, may the blessings
of all those that you love
and those who love you...
Mama.
Where am I now?
Where are we?
I knew how destroyed... I was.
Forgive me.
In that time, did she have
any medical history or medication?
About her mental health issues?
Had she ever had any Bang.
Or expressed any depression to you?
You got food all over you.
I just wanted to come...
come and sit next to you.
Things turned out a little different
than we thought they would, didn't they?
They like carrots and apples.
Every now and then,
I'll bring them one, but...
They're spoiled now.
These old guitars seem to have
a song ready-made for you.
They always have old songs...
loan... I can go on
for hours with one chord.
It's just one chord hammering.

Can you see?
Yeah, she has a face... a face like yours.
I do... f don't know... I didn't know
why I was coming to this party.
Then I saw you,
and I thought, "That's why."
You got a boyfriend?
No.
I don't think so. Did we meet before?
- Did we?
- I've seen you before.
- Where?
- Lots of times.
But I mean, I'm...
I'm not doing anything wrong, am I?
- By talking to you?
- No.
There's something on your face.
Did you get it?
- Huh?
- Did you get it?
Mm-mm.
Gotta come closer.
I got it.
Thank you.
Here we go.
- Okay, start from the beginning.
- Okay.
Does it start right there,
or does it have an intro'?
Do you want it to...?
But slower.
It's a love story.
Excuse... excuse me.
Hey.
Hi.
Is this happening?
Who was that girl
I saw you with at the hotel?
Just a girl.
A woman.
Why you smiling?
I don't know.
Wow.
I don't have to tell you
that kind of thing.
Oh, I didn't realize there
was something not to tell.
She was your girlfriend?
Mm-hmm.
What happened?
I went out with her,
and I never called her again.
Did you love her?
I didn't realize it at the time.
Mm-hmm.
Don't smile.
Well...
- You ready?
- Okay.
You gotta try harder than that.
I wish I could
take back every wound.
Guess that blue bug is back.
Every doubt.
You found me,.
You held out your hand.
I took sex.
A gift.
I played with it.
I played with the flame of life.
I was married in 1980,
and I've been a widow since...
1994, but...
I still wear my ring
'cause he's still my husband.
You know, we didn't get divorced, so...
This is... this is my wedding ring,
and this I bought
for myself after he died.
It's what they gave runners
who didn't win a marathon
but finished the race.
Be an artist.
I never thought I would live long.
You know, I'd be an artist
and die young of tuberculosis or something
like Charlotte Bronté, but, uh...
What bad thing did you do?
Just...
got involved with...
this man who I thought
could help me and...
You made a mistake, you know?
Do you look at it...
You'll do fine.
I love you.
Thank you.
Is that your fella?
Fight for him.
Really love him.
Don't let him get away.
