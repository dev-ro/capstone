EVERY CON HAS ITS PIGEON...
The Russians know how to treat a guy.
I'm there five minutes
and a girl knocks on the door.
And not just any girl, a total hottie...
- Good morning, ladies.
- We're closed.
I should hope so.
I don't plan on coming back.
What are you doing?
What do you mean?
I'm doing my job.
You received notification.
New safety standards.
Sub-section 1143, Public Hygiene Act.
I won't be long.
Maybe you'd like to do some shopping.
It's insecticide.
Yup, it's not lavender.
If we step outside,
you won't tell anyone.
I give you my word.
Come in!
- Solal Méricourt?
- That's right.
We have an appointment.
Henri Lardier,
transactions supervisor.
Take a seat.
It's a short-term operation
on the currency markets.
No names.
Discretion guaranteed.
We gotta move fast,
before the Nikkei opens in Tokyo.
I'll need to secure the funds
in a separate account.
- It's for you.
- For me?
I thought we had an appointment.
Don't take it like that.
No, I think...
There's been a misunderstanding.
I have to go.
Let's have lunch, the three of us.
- You're not hungry.
- I am. My belly's rumbling.
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER
I'm sorry.
Why do you always win?
Because it's for money.
She's come out again!
Quiet, you'll give me away.
Will you introduce me?
She doesn't like losers.
Hello, I'd like heaps of roses.
Heaps of roses?
Well, make your choice.
- I have some very nice ones inside.
- Perfect.
Can you maybe to layer it a bit?
- And keep it long at the same time?
- Sure. I can do that.
Actually,
I prefer white roses.
- How many would you like?
- Well...
All of them.
I LOVE YOU
- Can I take that?
- Yes, please.
- I'm not late yet.
- You were born late.
What are you up to?
The three of us have been waiting an hour.
You have the money?
Have you got the notes?
- I had them, but...
- Shit! Holy shit!
- Chill. Are you getting old or what?
- Sure, and you don't grow up.
Don't worry, I'll stock up.
When are you getting here?
15, 30 minutes?
- Tell Lea to expect a call.
- You're a pain in the ass!
Thanks.
No problem.
I'm sorry. Are you OK?
Open up, my wallet's been stolen!
Wait.
Hello, I need to cancel my cards.
Mine's gone too!
Don't leave till I find my wallet.
Frank Moreau...
18 34.
Yes. With immediate effect?
Thank you very much.
You want the number?
Thanks.
Credit Card Customer Service...
Yes, sir.
Lost or stolen?
What kind of card was it, sir?
Hold the line, I'll transfer you.
Your client.
Good morning, sir.
Your name, please?
Rouxel... Just a moment
while I enter your details.
I need your PIN
to verify you're the cardholder.
22 37...
It's being processed.
Mr Rouxel,
your card has been cancelled.
My pleasure.
Have a good day, sir.
Just to check.
Engraving, colours, printing,
all in-house.
Champagne!
The name of your engraver?
She designs, he prints.
Father and daughter.
We keep it in the family.
Sound?
I know what he's saying.
He's reassuring them.
They're scared
he'll switch the plates.
Here he comes.
It's money-time.
The buyer thinks he's won.
He just has to check the quality.
The banknotes.
François!
How much longer?
We're done.
The best you'll ever lay eyes on!
Don't overdo it.
The notes!
Never lose sight of the cash.
Never!
What the hell!
- I told you not to touch it!
- It's OK. Look.
It's full of gunk now!
Tell them to calm down.
Nobody could tell these are fakes,
not even the Bank of France.
- Go on, count it.
- I trust you.
Congratulations.
I've never seen such quality.
Me neither.
Watch the envelope.
His accomplices create a diversion
and he switches the envelopes.
Hardly surprising
the detector passed the notes.
He gave them real notes.
Fake fake notes!
- Am I interrupting?
- Never.
What's up?
A new face.
I'm giving him some space for now.
Two cards for Mr Kruger.
- Two cards.
- Two.
- Two.
- Here you go.
Two cards.
I'll raise you 5,000.
Five...
plus... ten.
- I fold.
- Count me out.
I'm curious...
- I fold.
- I fold.
Three kings.
Well played.
I'm always for taking a sucker down,
but money has to be the only motive.
The golden rule is
keep your emotions out,
have no connection to the pigeon.
Leave vendettas to the Mafia.
You think we're headed for a fall?
There's still time to call it off.
See you next time.
He take the bait?
Our friend enjoyed his evening.
He wants another game before he leaves.
- Where's he staying?
- The Belvedere in Monaco.
It won't bring him back.
Who?
Your brother.
Nor will that.
I'm too old to be told what to do.
Forget it.
Lardier's in jail. The cops'll find
his stash of currency paper.
That calls for a drink!
- Can I get you something?
- Yes.
We make a good team.
If you're recruiting, remember me.
People are fond of old fossils.
Getting anywhere?
At my age,
I have to keep my fingers agile.
Two sweaters a month
or else I lose the feeling in them.
I have something for you guys.
An insurance broker.
The perfect pigeon for a scam.
It's now or never.
He's only in town one night.
- Sorry, I'm busy.
- Something big?
Even better!
Champagne?
Daddy always says life's too short
to be only half-lived.
That's very good.
He's a wise man.
- I can't wait to meet him.
- Really?
- Are you free tomorrow?
- Why?
He's holding a lunch party.
It'd be a chance to meet.
- Sadly, I'm having lunch with a client.
- No problem, bring him along.
Pretty please.
I'll see what I can do.
Is this a regular Tuesday
or are we celebrating something?
It's Tuesday?
Maybe I should blindfold him.
Why?
Before I kiss you.
I told them not to hook up
to the gallery's security system.
It's totally amateur.
Look at this!
You sure he doesn't suspect?
He's doing a great job of jamming us.
- My source said the pigeon'll be here.
- He may interrupt something.
The picture's back.
He's got something special.
- What's going on?
- The Gypsy king's got the axe.
- Sure you won't need me?
- Positive.
You make very pretty couple.
I've been married 30 years.
It's a wonderful adventure.
The Gypsy remind you of someone?
This may sound odd,
but it's like we're being tricked.
I can't help wondering if all these lights
are there to show us something...
- You know?
- Yeah.
Or are they to blind us?
- Interesting, isn't it?
- Sure.
Will you marry me?
- Sorry?
- Will you marry me?
No one else is coming.
She's the pigeon.
- Where are they at?
- Breakfast. You said you'd be here at 7am.
Sit tight. My informer said
they're planning a huge job.
I'll be right there.
- Don't call, I said.
- Sorry, forgot. What have you got?
- I'm not talking.
- You didn't say she's the pigeon.
I want to know everything,
what's planned and when.
- Move it.
- I'm the wrong man.
Fred, I want a daily report.
- I know people here...
- Shut it!
You scared the shit out of me.
- Who's he calling?
- The Gypsy, I think.
The chick's gone?
- I'm quitting.
- Whaddya mean?
- We're shutting it down.
- You what?
You were right, it's all mixed up.
He can't do this to me.
- If they kill him, it's off.
- No way is he pulling out.
I can't see him staying in.
Get in.
You wanna get out?
You're crazy about me.
What's your name again?
Molina.
Lieutenant Julia Molina.
I knew a Molina once.
A good guy.
Bit of a chump, but a good guy.
The Lieutenant
thinks we had a job planned.
Oh? Something illegal you mean?
You should take me seriously.
Forging money buys you a long stay.
Ten years, at least.
With a good lawyer.
If the lady came all the way here,
there must be a solution.
May I?
You tell me it's off
and turn up with a cop to talk business.
- What's going on?
- What could I do?
Letallec and his thugs
will pay a fortune to find us.
It's time we took a holiday.
You saw them?
I'd have told you.
It's pretty obvious now.
We pack up and clear out.
No way.
Think about it...
I head up the team that's tailing you.
So, you keep on
with what you've started
and I file a nice report
about how quiet it is.
Excuse me.
For you, I'm the perfect alibi.
But I want my share.
Tell her to leave
before I kick her ass out.
If we're gonna be partners,
I recommend you change your tone.
Screw you!
If I were you,
I'd drop the attitude.
Past a certain age,
every year in jail counts double.
I'll let you put it away.
She can jail me,
I don't work with cops!
The game too complicated for you?
You wanna play?
You're not missing your partner?
In situations like these,
François tends to improvise.
He may not be very convincing.
- And you think I will be?
- You have a different skill set.
Champagne?
Make a wish.
I have.
A quick recap for latecomers.
You will not be buying the animal
whose portrait you see here.
The auction is simply to raise funds
for the charity.
Marc, go ahead...
His name's Podge.
He's three months old.
The highest bidder
will become his sponsor
and will receive
a monthly newsletter with photos.
What am I bid for Podge?
5,000 euros...
He's arrived.
Please excuse me.
I knew you'd come.
Daddy, this is Cash.
- You're all she talks about.
- She swears by you.
- Is Cash your real name?
- My rivals gave it to me.
Because of his results.
I understand you run an art gallery,
is that right?
Indeed.
Allow me to introduce Julia Molina.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- The client I mentioned.
- Right.
- Thanks for inviting me.
- I'm an art collector myself.
We were fated to meet.
Please excuse me.
- Save a seat for me.
- OK.
I don't think Daddy-in-law likes you.
Daddy's yours.
I'll take care of his daughter.
She's why you wanted
to close it down?
You've never been in love,
Lieutenant?
Try it. It feels good.
I never met the right person.
The target's the father.
Play it cool.
Let him do all the work.
Make him want to see you again.
- I often have that effect on men.
- I'd never have guessed.
Let slip
that you're a banker in Luxemburg.
- I doubt he'll find that very erotic.
- You're wrong.
Dubreuil can't get enough
of lucrative offshore investments.
Dangle a 15% Euribor rate
in front of him.
He'll want in big time.
- And if he doesn't?
- We'll steer him round to art.
He just has to trust you.
Then the money will flow.
- Is it slow?
- Depends on the client.
It's a sweetheart scam.
But how long
will I be playing his sweetheart?
Are you in a hurry?
The game too complicated for you?
Mr Dubreuil has offered to show us
his private collection later today.
Only because you insisted.
I have a few minor masters
that may amuse a collector.
You're very kind.
Who's your furry friend?
- Sorry?
- Your furry friend.
You're not going to bid?
Of course, definitely.
- Garance loves pippos.
- "Pippos"?
That's what she called hippos
when she was little.
I'm sure she'd be absolutely delighted.
- You've chosen for me.
- Above all, I didn't tell you.
- See you later?
- I promise.
To have such charming clients,
you can't be devoid of talent.
How come you're wasting your time
in the police?
I guess I underestimated myself.
It's my pleasure now
to introduce Loulou the hippo.
What am I bid?
7,000 euros!
Is he doing this on purpose?
That's three times.
He wouldn't keep a lady waiting.
Look on the bright side.
You got the pippo.
For 18,000 euros,
I expect a letter every week.
I'm surprised your fiancée
hasn't come to kiss her furry friend.
Thanks.
- Sorry to have kept you waiting.
- That's OK.
Over here, I'll lead the way.
- You have a beautiful house.
- Thank you.
- Is this the right way?
- Straight ahead.
It's always been in the family.
I know Garance would like to throw
a little party here after the ceremony.
- What ceremony?
- The wedding.
- It's going ahead, isn't it?
- I had no idea you knew.
You'll soon see
that my daughter and I are very close.
Come in, please.
Sweetheart,
your fiance's brought you a pippo.
Like I give a shit!
Sweet of you to chip in,
but we'd have sold the giraffe anyway.
- Wouldn't we, Vincent?
- It's a shame.
There was one guy desperate for it.
He dropped out at 15,000.
You didn't have to.
The gentleman is very generous.
And he pays in cash!
He's got it now. See, Garance?
He's not that stupid.
- What's going on?
- We've been conned.
Don't exaggerate.
You gave to a good cause
like the other generous donors.
Don't complain, you'll hear
from your furry friends. Nice little photos.
If you like the house,
they hire it out by the day.
Don't look so glum.
Everybody's gotta learn.
And I appreciate
you bringing the young lady.
My friends call me Maxime.
I have to confess,
you really made us laugh.
At first, I thought you were out
to join the team.
Especially as I was recruiting.
Than I realised
you had us down as pigeons.
So I hired Vincent instead.
He has magic fingers.
I did some research.
That's your problem.
You and your pals
are out of your league.
With certain exceptions.
Here...
This is for you.
Come and take a seat.
It's a pity.
We had something sweet lined up.
We could have worked as a family.
Sorry.
Are you in or out?
This time, I'm playing for keeps.
That bitch! That bitch!
If he's who I think he is,
he's wanted all over Europe.
He's never been caught once.
I'm sure she cheats.
Yeah, but she's with the smoothie.
He's history.
I gave him forged notes.
He's headed for jail.
You're telling me
you lost on purpose?
I have one flaw. I hate losing.
Maxime said they had a job lined up.
They'll need a replacement for Smoothie.
They'll call me.
And one of them's
gonna be eating her words.
- What am I accused of?
- Move!
You could've let me pick up my winnings.
The horse was 53 to 1!
If you wanna win,
don't bet with forged notes.
What forged notes?
Take it easy.
What's she doing here?
He was at the races.
He didn't have much on him,
we can't keep him long.
Lock him up
and forget the taps on the others.
I dug up a lead on the chick's father.
Forget it, I said.
Fred, listen up. I need to know
what they've got on Maxime.
Find out and call me before noon.
Gentlemen,
this is Lieutenant Julia Molina.
Inspectors Lebrun and Leblanc
are from Internal Affairs.
- Hello.
- We'd like a word.
- Hello.
- Well...
I have to get back
to my interrogation.
If you don't mind,
we have a few questions for you.
Glass of water?
Your boss doesn't seem to like us.
Chilled or ambient?
I guess he sees us as troublemakers.
Truth is,
we don't agree on his job description.
Results aren't everything.
Sums of seized cash have vanished.
At best, Barnes closes his eyes to it.
At worst, he's behind it.
In both cases,
he won't save his pension.
We're here to restructure the department.
If you have anything to say,
say it to us.
I'm not thirsty.
I had nothing to do with it.
You know forgery's not my line of work.
Anybody can change jobs.
Captain! He hit me.
You won't get out
till I hear something credible.
I told you, I was framed.
- Why won't you listen?
- Ask nicely.
I'm not in the mood to play games.
C'mon, Lardier, talk.
I'd heard about a poker game,
the kind that draws flocks of pigeons.
There was a guy there, early 30s,
confident, talkative,
top of the class type...
The ideal mark.
Name?
Cash. I told you, he had it all,
even the half-assed name.
Never heard of him.
Every hand,
he couldn't keep his mouth shut.
"You gotta pay Cash.
It's Cash up front..."
Get the picture?
And the currency paper under your bed?
That was him calling to see your flush?
Want me to describe him?
- Tell me about Maxime.
- Who?
Your boss!
Your inbox is full of instructions
to prepare for a job.
- All signed Maxime.
- What do you deduce from that?
I told you, no emotional involvement.
The pigeon feather is mean, sure,
but the cuddly toy for suckers
is a nice touch.
I like the kind of signature aspect.
You can't deny it's pretty classy.
I almost regret not being there.
Tell him she wasn't playing him.
Hi, Fred.
Where've you been?
Lost my number?
So you got cleaned out
by a master...
- What's your game?
- Unhappy to see me?
For a street kid, you've got talent.
But Maxime's the best there is.
Call me or I'll tell your friends
you're a snitch.
In Antwerp,
he took 17 million euros of diamonds
with nothing but a smile
and a chocolate box.
Don't worry, we all have bad days.
Just not so spectacularly bad.
- You can keep it.
- That's lucky, it's a perfect fit.
I should have bought the bracelet too.
Next time.
- I'm out of smokes.
- We haven't finished.
- We picked up Vincent this morning.
- I know. They called me.
Why are you telling her?
I saw Maxime looking at her.
We're going to need her.
The harder the shot,
the bigger the thrill.
Interesting.
But I'm bored.
A heist.
12 million euros.
Ten per cent for you.
Think you can handle it?
Thirty.
Fifteen.
If you hit a birdie at 14.
Did I tell you my handicap?
- Maybe I fluked it.
- You can't be crap at everything.
I propose a truce.
Have you known each other long?
She's my sister.
- Are you with us?
- Where are we headed?
Got anything against luxury?
Imagine a sun-drenched five-star hotel.
For obvious reasons,
I can't be more precise
as to the exact location
of the establishment.
The point is that in a few days
a guest at this palace by the sea
will place in the vault a case
containing millions of euros in diamonds.
Unregistered stones
generally used for illicit operations.
While the gentleman
enjoys the comfort of his suite,
other guests will take their turn
to visit the vault.
I shall have the pleasure
of leading the delegation personally.
We'll need to organise smoke screens.
I'd prefer to avoid prying eyes.
You will orchestrate
a number of diversions.
Let's go.
- Is there a problem?
- Please follow me.
You and your friends
will ensure you get noticed.
Keep security and the management
fully occupied.
You must divert attention
from the unit's progress.
Our first concern
will be the security system.
Once the system's neutralised,
the next step is to access the diamonds.
We'll enter through the room next door,
the hotel's steam room.
I have little taste
for gratuitous violence.
While we turn the steam room
into our command post,
you'll continue your good work.
Every single detail
must be minutely planned.
Our success depends on us
being perfectly synchronised.
The information at my disposal
suggests I'll need about an hour
to drill through the wall
and into the vault.
You will organise one final diversion
in collaboration with Garance.
Wonderful,
the Bedouin tents on the beach.
Reminds me of five years ago.
Sorry to interrupt,
but for a honeymoon job,
I prefer to work with Julia.
Wonderful,
the Bedouin tents on the beach.
Beautiful,
reminds me of five years ago.
You've been here before?
- I told you.
- You did?
- With Bernard.
- I didn't know.
I look a fool now.
It was a surprise.
What the hell!
You screw around!
- And I'm supposed to take it?
- Where's the respect?
- How does that feel?
- Asshole.
My mistake.
I'd love to team up
with your daughter.
- You don't stop screwing around.
- What's the matter with you?
And you? How about that?
That's much better.
After taking the stones,
we'll have exactly eight minutes,
to disappear before the vault
is automatically scanned.
- It's between me and my wife.
- It's OK.
The good news is that unregistered stones
don't officially exist.
Diamonds that don't exist
can't be stolen.
All that remains
is to celebrate our success.
To us!
- Is she really his daughter?
- Sure.
And you're my sister.
- He'll probably make a move now.
- Sorry?
You know, with you...
Spare me your vulgarity.
He may be a crook,
but it's obvious he's a gentleman.
Actually, he's invited me to dinner.
Can you get anything out of him?
I'm a cop.
It's my job to make suspects talk.
Hello?
- Fred's been shot.
- What?
We shut it down and split.
It was Letallec. It's her fault.
We'll be next.
We should have got out when I said.
We gotta run.
- No, we're not stopping now.
- Look!
- Maxime explained his job.
- You knew already?
- We can do it.
- Or get shot!
- Did you hear me? We've got him.
- Tell Fred that!
I'll talk to him.
We finish what we started.
Then we get those bastards.
You knew?
You knew it was Maxime from the start?
- François's right. I screwed up.
- Were you planning on telling me?
- Get off me!
- You still don't get it!
The feather, the cuddly toy...
the lovesick fiancé shit!
I'm right, huh? That's it.
You've been taking me for a ride.
- Give me one reason not to kill you.
- Maxime humiliated me.
It was my way in,
to make him think he's boss.
You really think you can scam him?
A new face...
- You look magnificent.
- You're not bad yourself.
I hope this doesn't feel too premature.
Life's short. I don't like to wait.
- Does your brother know about this?
- He's not my brother.
Should I be jealous?
Do I look the type
to settle for an amateur?
You don't like him, do you?
It's obvious he hates me.
I find it pathetic
that he can't hide it better.
I'll end up thinking
I chose the wrong partner.
The time may have come to switch.
Friends or enemies?
You have that many enemies, Maxime?
Less than you, Lieutenant.
I don't believe in coincidences.
After Vincent was arrested,
I did some digging,
and I confess
I'm curious about your intentions.
You're asking if you can trust me?
I know it's hard to believe, but I haven't
always been an exemplary officer.
Very soon, I'll have
Internal Affairs on my back.
It's time
I thought about a career change.
The diamonds arrive tomorrow.
Tomorrow evening, they'll be ours.
A South African uses
his annual trip to a luxury spa
to pay the mercenaries
who guard his mines.
That's the good news.
The bad news is
we're stealing 12 million euros
from people we can't afford
to have as enemies.
Their boss is the kind of bastard
France exported to Algeria and Chile.
One of yours.
An interrogation specialist.
Robbing him isn't enough.
We need to provide a suspect.
I'm beginning to see
why you hired Cash.
Accomplice to victim is a small step.
How can you be sure
they'll blame him?
The chief mercenary, Letallec.
Shall we eat?
Cash won't go down without a fight.
I think we've talked enough
about him for tonight.
Please...
I promise you,
the situation's under control.
What are you doing in the dark?
Worrying.
Did Cash ask you to come
and lecture me?
He didn't have to.
Do you think I'm past it too?
Tell him not to worry.
I won't let anyone down.
If his brother hadn't left me
in the van like an old fool,
we wouldn't be here now.
I could have helped him.
You're not to blame.
I should have gone with him.
We'll take them down.
Lardier'll get 20 years.
Screw Lardier!
In jail, with no gun,
he's just another asshole.
It's his boss who has to pay.
You still haven't told me
where we'll meet.
I'll call you.
The time comes
when you have to choose sides.
Evening, Lieutenant.
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for our search warrant.
I put it on the table, made a coffee,
came back and it had gone.
Vanished into thin air.
We've looked all over for it.
- What do you want?
- A chat.
Follow Finley's example.
At least he cooperates.
He told us about you.
Informers, dirty tricks, bribes...
He may be jealous, but even so...
What about your ethics?
I fear for your career.
Unless you accept our help.
The more we know, the nicer we get.
That's the way we are. The solution
could be the big fish you're after.
Hand him over to us
and we'll forget the rest.
Maybe even get you promoted.
What would you say to Barnes's job?
But I'll keep your badge and gun.
- You're going too far.
- Look who's talking.
- Look, Lebrun...
- No, the blond's Lebrun. I'm Leblanc.
It's easy. Lebrun's the blond
and the dick's Leblanc.
You had a message, a guy called Cash
asking about your evening.
It looks like you had fun.
That's how you treat your boss?
Think fast. You have till tomorrow.
- That's all you know?
- Yeah.
I mean, no.
Molina asked me to find out
about a guy called Dubreuil.
Then she didn't want to know.
You think I give a shit?
It's weird, though. Dubreuil was
a big wheel in the food industry,
but he died six months ago
of a brain haemorrhage.
Come in!
It's me.
The Belvedere in Monaco, 4pm.
I'll be there.
TO LET
Leblanc? Did I wake you up?
I'll accept your offer.
But we share the credit
for the arrest.
You don't trust us?
Go on, talk.
Is the swim cap necessary?
Get over it.
Looking ridiculous adds credibility.
Why's it always me?
Why do I always get to play
the nutcase or Gypsy violinist?
You must look the part.
I guess.
You're a millionaire at a luxury spa.
Don't complain.
And don't improvise.
Stick to what we agreed.
A millionaire's allowed to complain.
They're never happy.
Here we go.
I rewired their system.
Officially, it's being repaired.
In fact, it's working for us.
Call a doctor!
Someone's drowning!
I said fitness, not an assault course.
I'll ride the damn bike,
but first I eat. I'm hungry!
A short bike session
and then you can eat.
I eat when I want! I'm hungry.
Do you have sushi?
- Yes.
- Order me some.
- Looks like you do this often.
- Never again, hopefully.
I'll pedal, but I pedal alone.
I want no one in that room!
No kidding.
I'm paying enough for a little privacy.
Come on!
See you on the boat.
I'll be the first on board.
I want at those diamonds.
Leave this to the professionals.
We divvy up and he's yours.
Should I feel guilty?
If I wanted him, you wouldn't be here.
And him?
He's a big boy.
He played and lost. That's the rule.
Get out of here!
That's Kruger, the deliveryman.
He won't move,
but I set up a camera, in case
he wants to check on the diamonds.
- How's it going?
- To plan.
They're going into the vault.
Tell me when the mercenaries arrive.
We still doing this together?
Why? Do you plan on proposing?
So what was last night?
- A kiss-off?
- A need.
- Nothing to add?
- Sure.
Please wait
in the reading room upstairs.
Thank you.
Mummy!
You're not my mummy!
Letallec and his men
are in a corridor to your left.
Left's quicker.
Are you coming?
Captain!
Can't bear for us to be parted?
I wanted to apologise personally.
The forged notes weren't you.
- I'd like you to introduce me to him.
- You found him. Good job.
Toffee?
How about like that?
You remember Solal Méricourt?
I had an alibi. I was acquitted.
Let me tell you what I think.
Cash and his friends want the guy
who put a hit out on Solal.
And that could turn out
to be your boss... Maxime.
Not that again. I never had a boss.
I'm freelance. I work alone.
You'll never convince me of that.
You're too stupid.
Brussels. Internal Affairs.
- Captain Leroux for you.
- Hello?
That's me.
I know. Your inspectors
already came to see me.
Leblanc and Lebrun.
No, Leroux, I'm serious.
Are you sure?
I'll get back to you.
They don't have an Inspector Lebrun
or Leblanc at Internal Affairs.
One new message.
Where are you?
They're already in the vault.
You'll miss them.
Call me when your men are in position.
- Where have you been?
- There's been a change of plan.
We've decided we can't trust
someone who betrays her boss.
Not ethical.
Maybe we can keep you
out of jail, though.
If you name names,
perhaps we can cut a deal.
In five minutes,
the hotel will be crawling with cops.
Time to head for the hills.
- The mercenaries have Cash.
- What?
We told the guy
the vault wasn't secure.
He kept the diamonds in his room.
You thought
we'd let those idiots screw us?
Cash'll tell them
the vault's being robbed.
They'll find Maxime's gang.
While they fight it out,
Lea frees Cash and I snatch the case.
- How?
- The old-fashioned way.
I've been waiting 30 years for this.
I thought I'd die small-time.
I started as a pickpocket.
10 years of find-the-lady.
Then I sold
the Eiffel Tower to tourists.
This is heaven.
12 million's a hell of a pension.
Sorry. I'm the one who's retiring.
Get in, go on.
Freeze!
You deaf? Who the hell are you?
If I were you, I'd get out.
You're not me.
Face down.
Face down.
I swear it was here.
Pool tables, players, waitresses...
I swear. You have to believe me.
That was the poker room back there.
TO RENT
Look.
See? I was right.
I wasn't lying.
Your alibi for the day of Solal's murder?
Who provided it?
I can go back to the office
to check in your file,
but I'd be wasting time
and might get annoyed.
Do you want me
to repeat the question?
Lieutenant Molina.
Julia Molina.
- Back it up, sir.
- I have a flat.
- You're blocking the entrance.
- Lend me a hand instead of yelling.
- What kind of treatment do you offer?
- The full range.
Mummy!
You're not my mummy!
- Start her up.
- When Maxime gets here.
We're not waiting.
And you stay here.
Stop!
My wife wants to leave
her jewels in the vault.
- Sorry, that's impossible.
- Really? Why?
Unfortunately, we don't have a vault.
I'm nearly into the vault.
Jeez, it's hot in here.
Think icy rocks.
You're a kid. It's my turn.
- How's it going?
- I'm losing my share.
Give me what you have left.
The door!
Have some respect for poker.
Can I play?
Solal... dead.
Dubreuil... fake.
Cash... fake.
Lebrun... fake.
Leblanc... fake.
Lardier...
stupid!
I have bad news for you.
You're going down for murder.
- Who have I killed now?
- Solal Méricourt.
- I want to see my lawyer.
- You'll get twenty years.
- Can't we cut a deal?
- I'm all ears.
She'd creamed off
a heap of seized money.
She wanted to launder it abroad.
Solal showed up, acting the broker.
Sold her a two-part package.
After the first instalment,
she realised it was a scam.
She could hardly arrest him,
could she?
The second instalment
was you and a gun.
Yeah, and I had no choice.
If I didn't agree,
I'd be going to jail.
You see, I'm the victim.
Don't complain, Lardier.
You could be in her shoes.
Some bitch robbed us.
Get the guys and bring her back.
No. Alive.
I want a word with her.
Mummy!
Yes, darling.
- Can I have an ice cream?
- Ask your father.
Daddy!
Can I have an ice cream?
Of course, sweetheart.
You've earned it.
- You can give up knitting now.
- You're kidding. Never!
Sure, the false beard and blood
are useful,
but talent is vital.
The grimace does it every time.
- Champagne!
- Forget it, he's a conman.
Next job we do,
I'm not playing the jailbird.
Stop whining,
you were out within a day.
You think being a corpse is fun?
I died twice on this one, my friend.
Next time, you go to jail.
- Really?
- Yeah.
On principle. Jail's a downer.
Next time, try the swim cap
and the closet.
That really flatters the ego.
You see those mercenaries?
I'm glad they're not after me!
You think
she preferred Lebrun or Leblanc?
- Who's Leblanc? You?
- He's Leblanc.
You are!
- Send me my share.
- Sure you won't stay a while?
I have an appointment tomorrow
in Buenos Aires.
Mondays, I have tango.
Let's recap. You have a full tank
and 10 minutes head start.
Trouble is, the gun you're carrying
is loaded with blanks.
And there's a gift for you.
From Solal.
Am I interrupting?
Will you marry me?
- I have to ask my husband.
- Yes. Sorry.
To Solal!
- To Solal!
- To Solal!
- To Solal!
- To Solal!
We all put 20 cents in the pot.
The one-euro coin is the jack.
You throw your marble
and the closest wins the pot.
OK?
