He's the kind of boy
who should be studying.
Yes, but six kilometers
to get to school
and six kilometers back
seems like a lot to me.
He's young, he has
good strong legs!
Just when we're about
to have another baby...
He could have started
helping me around the house.
He'll help you
when he's older.
Let Providence
provide now.
l grew up without ever seeing
the inside of a school.
That's not a good reason
and you know it.
lf God has given
intelligence to your son,
it's a sign He wants more from
your son than He does of others.
You're his father and it's
your duty to do God's bidding.
Just what we needed
was this worry too.
THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS
lnterpreted by the people
of the Bergamo countryside
A peasant's son going to
school. What will people say?
A farmstead in Lombardy
at the end of the 19th century.
Four or five peasant families
lived here...
...The house, land, and livestock
belonged to the landowner
A part of the harvest
was given to him.
Let him see too. Don't make
noise, the foal is frightened.
Be careful not get any
husks into the maize.
Cross yourself nicely!
Make the Sign of the Cross now.
Under the covers and
ask your guardian angel
to stay close.
So, are you happy
you'll be going to school?
Hold the sack tight.
No, hold it at the top
and open it wide.
The bailiff is here!
The maize should
be weighed today.
Take care of it.
You can bring the
figures to me later.
Rosa, please tell my
wife to come up here.
Come on, hurry up
with those rocks.
Move up, let's go now,
get a move on.
Can't you move over
here and unload?
Be careful you don't make
holes in those sacks.
Giopa is here!
May the Lord always give
us work and good health
and never let us
want for anything.
Here, take this.
For our dear departed ones
and the souls in Purgatory,
may they ascend to Heaven.
No children, don't laugh.
Poor souls like that who have
nothing are closer to God.
Here girls, take this.
Tell your mother l need it
before Saturday.
Get inside, girls!
Blessed Mother! Teresina,
wait, let me get on.
Alright, but we'll take
turns. You first, then me.
Alright, start counting.
...fifty!
Now it's your turn.
You're a lot
heavier than me,
l'm only going to
count to forty.
Alright, be careful,
go slowly!
The wash is all on the
ground, what did you do?
l couldn't keep going.
The lady at the hotel said
to bring them
before Saturday.
How? Can't you see
l have two full baskets?
Teresina, look at the
pretty stones l found.
Girls, pick up the baby
and go see if Grandpa
Anselmo needs anything.
Tell Pierino to help Grandpa
wash the milk pails.
l wanted to know if l
could say hello to you.
l'd like to be able to wish
you a good evening.
lf that's all you want,
then there's no harm in it.
Won't you say
anything back to me?
l'll wish you a
good evening too.
l want to take a bath
in the basin too.
ls that water warm enough?
lt's fine, it's
good and warm
Here you go, sit
down in there.
First, we wash
your shoulders,
then your
neck and ears.
Now close your eyes...
we'll soap you up good
Minek, sleep now.
Say the Our Father and
Hail Mary tomorrow morning,
so God will
light your mind.
Why do you need
the chicken droppings?
For the springtime, when
l plant the tomatoes.
Mama, they're fighting!
What is it? They fight
like cats and dogs everyday.
Aren't you Andrea
Runk's son?
The man who died recently?
l knew your father well,
he was a good man.
He left a widow
with six children.
The poor woman has to
take in wash to feed them.
The machine is
out of grain.
- How old are you now?
- l'm fifteen.
l need a strong boy, you
can work here if you like.
l'd like to work
here very much.
Let's see what
your mother says.
For me, you can
start tomorrow.
Here's the stable.
- What should we do?
- Let's go in.
The suitors are here!
Be quiet for a moment.
Children, come outside.
Listen, the pipers are playing.
Mama, the pipers!
They must be
at the landlord's house.
lt's freezing tonight.
Listen Tonino, listen to
how nicely they play.
lt's already Christmas time.
Grandpa, the moon!
''Haze around the moon,
snow is coming soon''.
Not if the cold
doesn't let up.
- What does that mean?
- The earth needs the snow.
Who's there?
lt's snowing.
Papa, where are you
going at this hour?
lt's snowing, l have to put the
chicken manure in the garden.
lt's for this spring when
l plant the tomatoes.
Chicken manure is stronger
than cow manure,
if l put down just a little,
the ground won't freeze.
Do you have do
this at night?
l don't want
anyone to see me.
lf this works, l'll bring
ripe tomotoes to the market
two or three weeks
before anyone else.
You and your thoughts
had better be careful,
you'll catch your death!
Be quiet, Garibaldi.
lt's snowing.
''Bones to the dogs,
meat to the butcher''
''The blackbird pecks
at the soil''
''Women are silent
while the men toil''
''When snails are on the rose,
a lad to his lady does propose''
''There's blood
to make a pudding too''
''And a kick in the pants
for all of you!''
Listen to you, Batisti!
How does he invent
all these stories?
He has a new
one every night.
Let's say the rosary before
the children all fall asleep.
lt's still early.
You'll be tired later.
Batisti, tell us the
one about the ditch!
He can tell that
story another night.
He'll need heavier clothes,
it's starting to get cold.
He'll have to make do
with what he has for now.
We'll have to think about
paying the midwife soon.
We can make do
with the women here,
after all, it's not
the first time.
Don't talk that way,
it can be dangerous.
The tub needs washing.
Where should l put these?
The butcher is coming
to slaughter the pig.
lt's going to be wet today.
''A pig in the snow
is like wine down below''.
Only if the grapes
were good.
ls that water hot
enough yet?
The hotter the better,
keep the fire good and hot.
The bailiff is here.
Hasn't the landlord
come yet?
No, he'll be arriving later.
- How can we weigh it then?
- l'm here to weigh it!
How did you raise
this animal?
Come in the house
- and have a glass of wine.
- Perhaps later.
Are you trying to kill
this animal before its time?
Everyone pull this way.
Push it with the stick now!
There, in the middle. Get
your fingers out of the way.
What do you think?
lt's a good animal.
Good day, Father Carlo.
l saw your son going to
school. How is that going?
lt's fine for now,
l can't complain.
You'll see, you'll be pleased
with that boy someday.
lf God blesses
me that way...
Where is Widow Runk?
She's at the stream washing,
should l go and get her?
No, it's not important,
l'll go find her.
- That's a fine big animal!
- l can't complain.
- There will be plenty of meat
- l know how it was raised!
l cared for it better
than any Christian.
Then take care to love God,
or you'll reach the same end!
What have l done wrong?
l've never killed anyone!
That's not enough.
How should we
do the weighing?
Take care of it yourselves.
Don't you want
some to eat?
We'll see...
Go home with the others,
l'll hold the umbrella.
l'm sorry l look this way,
Father, what can l do for you?
Don't worry and keep
working. l've come here
because l have something
important to tell you.
As l didn't see you
in church last Sunday...
You're right. Sometimes
l don't know where to turn...
or how to keep going
with six children to raise.
l'm not here to scold you,
in fact l'll tell you now
that you're right to stay home
and care for your children.
This is a duty that comes
even before Mass
Even the Lord understands
certain things.
lt's about your children
that l want to speak with you.
l spoke to the Mother Superior
at the orphanage yesterday.
There's no room right now,
but l told her about you
and they'll take the little
ones to help you breathe a bit.
The others are growing up...
What do you think about it?
When my eldest son
comes home from work tonight.
l'll speak to him about it
l don't know
what to tell you
lt's the only thing we can do
for the moment
Children, move back
or you'll get burned!
lt's cold tonight,
there are so many stars out!
Come, l've made
some hot water for you
Don't waste the coals, we won't
have enough for the bedwarmers
Eat your soup
before it gets cold
Bring the soup here,
we'll eat by the fire
Grandpa, make the sparks fly!
Sparks are devils
who've escped from Hell
Why do the devils escape
from Hell?
To go out
looking for souls!
Are there souls
in the fireplace?
No, there are no souls in the fireplace,
they go out the chimney
and above the roof to
look for souls to harm
But devils are afraid
of good people
When the devil finds
a good man or a good child,
he runs away!
With the sign of the Cross too
Do you say your prayers?
l do!
Then you don't have
to be afraid
Move the fire, you'll see them
run far away
Go away devils in this house! Go
away, there are good children here!
Father Carlo came today,
he came here just for us
and told me
there is a possibility to send
Annetta and Bettina away
l told him we'd talk about
it at home tonight
Do we really need
to send them away?
lf we really don't have
enough to live on...
Teresina will be
twelve this spring,
she can start to work
at the spinning mill
Pierino can help in the
house and the stables
l'd rather work day and night,
but we'll keep my brothers
and sisters at home with us
What are you
doing, Grandpa?
l'm planting seeds
What kind of seeds?
Tomatoes!
Now what are you doing?
Hiding them where it's warm
under the straw. Even if
it'scold, they'll sprout
Come here by
the grain sacks
Antonio, you go there, you go
over there and l'll go here
Look in the hayloft
l'll look in the hayloft!
Hide, don't let them see you.
Come under
Go look under the
straw in the stable
Mama, Grandpa said
to come to the stable
He said to hurry
What's wrong with her?
She's been like this all day
She isn't eating
and she can't get up
God, not foot and mouth...
The only thing to do is
call the veterinarian
Pierino, Mama said
to go get the
veterinarian!
They're playing
hide and seek
Pierino...
They're playing hide and seek
Annetta, go tell Mama
the veterinarian is here
Anselmo, what's happened
to this poor beast?
lt looks bad this time
Was it nice to ride?
Get some fresh water
and bring it to the stable
You go into the house!
ls this your animal
or is it the landlord's?
lt's ours by the
grace of God
You're not in His
grace this time
Blessed Mother,
what happened to her?
Listen to me,
the truth is that l wouldn't
let her live until noon
Butcher her while
you're in time and
can make a few coins
Go back to the house!
Not this too...
you can see what condition we're
in. We don't have enough to live
Listen to me
and do as l say while
you're still in time
Don't say anything
to the children!
How much for your
trouble, Doctor?
You have enough troubles,
some other time
You start cooking the polenta,
l'll be back shortly
Let's put on the water
for the polenta
God, don't abandon me now
that l'm all alone
l do what l can,
You can see that,
but without Your grace,
l'll never be able to go on
Oh Lord,
who died on the
cross for our sins,
don't look at our merits,
but at Your goodness
and make this water pass
beneath the cross of Calvary
wash away all the ills
of body and soul
Jesus, forgive all our sins,
even those we commit
without knowing we commit them
and for the love
of Your five wounds,
for the pain of the Virgin Mary
and all the saints and souls,
give me this blessing, Lord
You can't refuse me!
Here, sit and eat some
polenta while it's still hot
Hello, you're home?
Come here, come and
get yourself warm
His feet are wet
Let's take off your clogs
and socks and get you warm
Be careful, or you'll
get chilblains
Here, eat
What did your teacher say?
He talked about water!
He said there's lots of
little animals in water
Fish!
No, not fish
Other tiny little animals
and in a drop
of water there are lots,
even drinking water
Yes, tiny little animals
that you can't see
lf you can't see them, how do
you know they're in there?
With a machine that has a thing
that looks in the water
Doctor's instruments!
There are still
things to learn!
Holy Mary, you scared me!
Why?
What are you doing here?
l wanted to see you
We see each other every
night at the farmhouse
lt's one thing to see you at the
farmhouse with everyone else
and another to
see you here alone
lt's still very cold at night
No, even the water in
the ditches isn't freezing now
Fifteen days from now
we'll be in Our Lady's month...
and l wanted to
ask you for a kiss
Those are things that happen
when the time comes
Good evening
Good evening!
Lift those sacks over there,
your feet are on them
you lazy good for nothing!
The pail of milk spilt
all over, you idiot!
Then you do this work
if others aren't able to!
lngrate! Don't come near me
or l'll beat you!
Blessed Mother,
they're fighting!
Get them apart!
Finard, aren't you ashamed?
You'd hit your own father!
l curse you!
No Finard, God hears
and never forgives
a father's curse
Mama, the cow is standing!
Go tell Grandpa
to come right away!
Thank you, Lord
Friki is here, ladies!
Beautiful first quality cloth!
Good prices, come and see
the best cloth on the market!
Wil you swindle us
like last time, Friki?
Friki has never
swindled anyone!
l respect women as much
as l respect monkeys!
Come ladies, l'll make
your husbands proud of you
l've got the finest,
first quality cloth,
all colors of ribbons,
buttons and threads
Come and look
and this will make you happy...
This is just right for you!
The color is too light
Then take the darker one,
look at that pretty skirt!
Did you hear that?
lt said hello!
First quality cloth
to make a blouse or skirt
for the Feast of Our Lady
All bargains,
you couldn't
steal them for less!
This is the best from Paris,
first quality from abroad!
Listen to Friki, l've been to Africa
and l know about monkeys
They reason better than men do
He'll get us confused with the
monkey stuff and
cheat us...
How much for this one?
Clever lady, that's the best!
Give us a bargain,
she's getting married
Ask any bride around here
if l haven't made them happy!
Quiet now,
Friki is a rascal!
One day a group of foolish boys
had the idea to throw stones
at French soldiers passing by
Their commander,
General Lutrec,
decided to burn the village
to punish them
ln desperation, the people
ran to the church to pray
just as children do when in
danger, they call their mother
So the Madonna, our heavenly Mother,
Mother of us all, performed a miracle
The Madonna and Child painted
on this wall began to cry
A messenger was sent
to tell General Lutrec
He didn't believe the man
and thought it was trick,
so he came here
When he saw the
Madonna crying,
he fell to his knees and
put his helmet and sword
at her feet in devotion
350 years have passed since,
but that sword and that helmet
are still there to remind us
of all the dangers
waiting in the world
We gather here each year
to remember that great miracle,
and to remember all
the other miracles
that happen everyday
in every corner on earth
in the lives of men
and of all creation
Dear people, we wouldn't
be here without miracles
Miracles are the strength that man doesn't
have, they are the strength of God's love
This love is as necessary
to us as the air we breathe,
as the land which feeds us,
and the water and light
which give us life
The only way we can deserve
God's love is by loving our neighbor
May Christ be praised
Ladies and gentlemen,
l'd like a volunteer
l want to demonstrate to you
what this animal
can really do!
Not your hat,
take off your jacket
l want to show the people
the miracle this fat performs,
this fat that truly
heals all ills
Give me your hand. Do you feel
pain here, here and here?
Like this, it has to be
spread like this...
from the bottom to the top
Do you see the water
coming out?
You have arthritis,
yes you do, sir, tell them!
Mama, Papa is...
He's going straight upstairs
My God, you can't even
climb the stairs,
what have you done?
Nothing... they
got me drunk
lt was my friends!
What can l do?
Look at the condition
you came home in!
What condition...
so l'm drunk,
stop it now
