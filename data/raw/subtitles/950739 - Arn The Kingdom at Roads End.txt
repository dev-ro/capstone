West Gothia
A.D. 1187
Far up, In the cold and dark north -
Was the kingdom, West Gothia,
a small divided kingdom -
where three mighty clans
fought for the crown.
In this darkness the Christian faith
was spread through churches
and monasteries.
But for one woman, the monastary felt,
like a home without God.
held without her consent.
Separated from her beloved, sentenced
to serve in the Holy land.
Cecilia.
You have a visitor.
Cecilia!
It is good to see you.
Did something happen?
No.
You haven't visited
for many years, Brosa.
Yes, your penance is soon finished.
Have you thought about the future?
You are a "Folkung" friend,
and a personal friend to the queen.
I am sure that many
would like to marry you.
You need a man, Cecilia.
It would strenthen your position.
It would strengthen us all.
I have sworn to wait for him.
Prepare for the worst. - He's alive.
He is a castle lord in Gaza.
That information is several years old.
- I will wait for him.
- And what if he doesn't come back?
Then I will have no man.
ARN - The kingdom at the end of the road
-Robbers?
-No, Soldiers.
Get them!
Tilt the bow!
-Open the gate!
-Open the gate!
It's the castle lord! open the gate!
Are you allright, sir?
-Who shot the arrow?
-One of the new sergeants.
We where training and saw you where in trouble.
That's the man.
Send him in.
You wished to see me, sir.
- Your name?
-They call me, Aral d'Austin.
You're a most skillful archer,
Aral d'Austin.
Thank you, sir.
-In what kingdom is Austin?
-It's not a kingdom sir, it's my name.
My name is Harald Oysteinsson,
From Norway.
My name is Arn Magnusson
from West Gothia.
Who would belive it?
meeting a "Folkung" down here...
And a friend. Thank you.
It was my family that helped king Knut
to hide in Norway.
Is Knut Eriksson, King?
You must have been gone long.
Knut has reigned peacefully
for many many years.
Do you know of Magnus Folkesson
at Arnaes?
Of course, You bet I do.
But sadly Magnus Folkesson
has passed away now.
When?
He passed two winters ago.
His son Eskil is lord at Arnaes now.
And you, how did you end up here?
Was Magnus Folkesson your father?
I am sorry. I am truly sorry.
You have served our order faithfully
and I want to make sure you recieve
your rightful reward when the day comes.
This is your way out of here.
West Gothia...
Cecilia. Come.
Cecilia...
Gud has sent you,
so that you can forgive me.
What can I forgive you for, mother?
- My sins.
My sins against you.
I wanted to prevent yours and
Arn Magnusson's happiness.
Give me my child! No!!!
I wanted to punish you, since I
never found love.
I never wished for...
- the life of the monastary.
It was my fathers will.
He sent me here -
behind these walls...
Yes, You are a good person, Cecilia.
Good hearted and forgiving.
Your prayers could shorten
my time in purgatory.
Can you forgive me?
Can you forgive me?
Only God can forgive you.
I curse you.
I curse you, Cecilia Algotsdotter!
I curse you!
You and Arn Magnusson!
Sir! Message from headquarters, sir.
- He is tired. -Tired!
- Finish him off!
That's enough.
go back to your duties!
He was asking for it!
You make two mistakes, Harald.
First, your sword is to heavy.
This? I would have picket a bigger one.
Secondly, you fight like a viking.
With respect my Lord,
I have never learned any other way,
and I have done well so far.
I have received orders from Jerusalem.
The Grandmaster wants us to join
with a force out in the desert.
I want you to come with me
as my sergeant.
Thank you, my lord!
I humbly thank you. It will be an honour
to serve a "Folkung".
- We have a long ride ahead of us
Then you have picked the right man.
You will not be dissapointed!
Nice day.
It has gotten rather hot.
If I only had some ale...
Save your strength, Harald.
Ale, ale, ale, ale, ale...
Enemy forces are moving north.
They must be planning something.
What are the sarace like?
Are they as evil as they say?
They are like us
Some are evil, some are good.
But their leader Saladin
He must be a terrible demon?
Is it true that you are the only one
that has defeated him?
Saladin is far from defeated.
Isn't it just a matter of time?
We must have faith, Harald.
We must have faith to conquer evil.
And what if we can't conquer evil?
Then we die.
Heat during the day and icy cold nights...
I allready miss the fiords.
Do you never long for home?
- Yes
But my time here is soon at an end.
At the next full moon, I will return home.
I am sorry for the loss of
the beloved mother Rikissa.
But in times of sorrow one must
look to the future, don't you think?
I have spoken with the King's Jarl Birger Brosa.
He speaks well of you.
I have no reason to doubt his word
I would like to see a reverent mother from
the Folkung clan in one of our monastaries..
And now there is an opening.
Would you consider becoming reverent mother
in Gudhem? -Your own monastary.
Thank you for this generous offer -
but I can not and will not
give my vows.
You won't?
- My penance is nearly over.
I have endured my punishment.
At the next full moon I leave Gudhem
to go to the queen at Visingsoe.
I will await my bethrothed there.
Tell Brosa that.
Where did that come from?
It belongs to the beduins in our territory.
Proceed to the grandmasters castle.
We will meet you there. - Sir?
-I have promised them our protection.
-The beduins?
They are spies. They give us
information in exchange for our protection.
My lord...
Get her!
-That's enough!
-Who the hell are you?
I am Arn de Gothia. This is my territory.
I am carrying out my duty to the cross.
Your duty to the cross
is not to kill innocent people.
-But they are Saracen!
-Leave!
-Whose side are you on?
-Leave. Now!
You leave, saracen lover.
He's a coward!
Stay out of this, Harald.
-Let's go.
-We are not going anywhere.
Al Ghouti...
We thank you for coming.
God sent you, to our rescue.
He has seen your sorrow.
God tests our hearts through pain and sorrow.
Sir...
-de Gothia...
-I would like you to read this.
It is an honourable discharge,
signed by grandmaster Torroja.
The day after tomorrow my time here is due.
I am well aware, de Gothia, that my predecessor
thought highly of you - For some reason -
-but to me you are just another subordinate.
-I don't think you will mourn my departure.
-Departure?
-My penance is over.
Departure? When we're about to crush
Saladin once and for all
Turning tail on the eve of battle, de Gothia...
You are free to leave.
But if you leave...
you will leave as a deserter.
I have received news that Saladin and his army
Has set up camp -
-here, by the lake of Tiberias
There they await reinforcements.
We, shall march directly to Tiberias...
...and take him by surprise. Is that clear?
-Sir!
There is not a single drop of water on the
way to Tiberias. It is hotter than hell out there.
I must agree with de Gothia.
It will take us three days to cross the desert.
Saladin's army is bigger than ours.
And he has the water.
-We can not meet him in the desert.
-That is exactly what Saladin thinks.
And that is why we shall defeat him.
We have the true cross, de Gothia.
Under it has no Christian army
been defeated.
It was because of the true cross
That we where victorious at Mont Gisard.
And now we shall be victorious again.
Or do you doubt the power of the true cross?
It is not the true cross that I doubt,
Grandmaster.
You will obey my orders.
You are right, de Gothia.
But he is in command now.
When do we ride on? Where will the battle be?
You will not ride with us, Harald.
I will ride where you ride!
- Go home to Gaza and go home with the next ship.
I release you from service.
I will fight by your side!
Harald, it is an order.
I am not afraid to die.
- I do not question your courage
I had hoped that we
could travel home together.
Now I send you ahead.
One day we will meet there again.
Halt!
We raise our tents here.
Master we can not set up camp here.
We need to find water.
The men are exhausted. Raise the tents!
Pardon me... The templars
will break camp in the morning.
Their army stands south of the horn of Hattin.
-They intend to meet us in the desert.
-Fools...
After a great defeat
comes a great victory.
If God wills it...
I swear, I will come for you
I will wait for you.
What if he doesn't come back?
Then I will have no man.
You do not bring much with you
out into the world, Cecilia Algotsdotter.
The King and Queen
wait for you at Visingsoe.
I have also sent Magnus there.
So, now he knows?
- Yes, now he knows.
I heard that you declined
bishop Erland's offer.
I understand that you need
time to think.
I have had all the time I need.
Blanka!
I am so happy to see you.
Good to see you again, Cecilia.
- King Knut.
This is for you.
- Thank you.
Come and meet our sons.
This is Erik the oldest. - Welcome.
This is Jon. -Welcome
and little Knut.
Magnus.
Mother.
Magnus, Don't stand there in the rain.
Get inside.
I only tell it like it is, even if it is
uncomfortable to hear.
We have to be one step ahead
of Sverker Karlsson.
It will not be long until he makes a claim on the crown
and he will be bringing the danes with him.
I say, Let them come.
We can not handle it.
We can not fight the Danish.
I know where you stand. But I will not
bow down to Sverker or the Danish.
No, no, that is not what I mean. All I am
saying is that we need to protect our home.
Ah but look,
here is our beloved guest of honour.
Come, sitt down.
You really look radiant, Cecilia.
- And her future would be radiant also,
if she would listen to good advice.
Brosa wants me as
Reverent mother at Gudhem.
It is an honorable task, Cecilia.
The power of the church is great,
it is as great as the kings.
We must try to place a Folkung -
in every important position
to weaken the influence of the Sverker clan.
If Brosa is so enamoured with monastic life,
then I am sure Varnhem will receive a new brother with open arms.
Min hustru har en skrap tunge.
Men vi ved begge, du mener det godt, Brosa.
My wife has a sharp tongue, but we know she means well
Cecilia, welcome to Visingsoe.
Am I disturbing you?
- No.
Come in.
Sit down.
You must have been wondering.
Your father...
Your father and I...
- I know.
You don't have to...
Brosa says that he is dead.
- He doesn't know that.
He is, he is in my prayers.
- And in mine.
Fire! Fire!
ALLAHU AKBAR !!!
ALLAHU AKBAR !!!
"Let those fight in the cause of Allah Who sell the life of this world for the hereafter. To him who fighteth in the cause of Allah,- whether he is slain or gets victory - Soon shall We give him a reward of great (value)."          An-Nisa 4:74
True cross couldn't even save itself...
My name is Ebbe Sunesen.
I come from Denmark as a friend.
The Danish king is very
concerned to keep peace.
Also in your kingdom.
He would like you to be reconciled
with the Sverker clan.
If he thinks I will freely give the crown
to Sverker Karlsson, then he is greatly mistaken.
If Sverker Karlsson wanted to take the crown
from you, he would have done so, long ago.
Like you once took it from his father.
Let us be reasonable.
The clans have fought for many generations,
and we have all lost many friends.
I do not think we want any more bloodshed.
Is the King feeling ill?
He would have been a lot better
had he not been drinking so much ale.
Tell me,
Who is the queens friend.
I am Cecilia Algotsdotter.
- Lay sister in the monastary of Gudhem
for many years.
A nun...
She does not look like a nun!
That is my mother you are talking about.
Is that so, my boy? Where is your father?
- He is a Knights templar in the Holy land.
My condolances.
What do you mean?
Jerusalem has fallen.
The Templars where slaughtered like dogs.
They died.
All of them.
You lie!
-Magnus!
I have sinned,
but I never lie.
If you can best me in combat,
then you may call me what you like.
Magnus, Calm down.
Where am I?
Damaskus.
Why am I alive?
Ask my brother.
He was the one who saw you.
The conquered greet you,
victorious king!
I greet you, most worthy opponent.
Please, have a seat.
I have Jerusalem in my hand.
The city will fall when I wish it.
To show mercy
is the mark of a great king.
The Christians killed everyone when they took the Holy city
My people would wish the same.
If you choose the path of revenge...
...The Christians will come back
in greater numbers than ever.
And the war will never end.
You speak wisely, Al Ghouti.
If all our enemies wher like you
it would be difficult to win this war.
It may be that one day...
...we could share this great city
all men alike.
Take this dream of peace and unity
with you home.
It is time for you to return home
and keep your promise.
You have a long journey ahead of you.
Ibrahim will be your guide.
It is a great honour
to serve Al Ghouti.
I hope you will not only remember me
as an enemy, Al Ghouti.
No, my king. That I could never do.
Our friendship will always remain,
even if I become a reverent mother.
I have to find a purpose for my life.
The monastic life is the only life I know.
Welcome back.
Cecilia...
It is you.
It is you!
It is you...
Mother?
I should never have brought you
That time.
If you wheren't known as a friend
to the one who killed the king,
- you and Cecilia would not
have been judged so hard.
I followed you by my own choice.
I did it to be able to Marry Cecilia
Arn, You are my friend...
and I promised you my support
When it comes to Cecilia
Nothing would make me happier
Than to see you two married
But I must listen to Brosa
Love...
Love is for drones and weaklings
You have your priviliges and rights,
but with the rights come obligations!
And you have obligations to your clan
I have sworn an oath!
Oath!!!
You where just a child
You are going against your King...
... against your clan ...
For a promise you made while you
where still wetting your pants
You are a "Folkung"
First and foremost a "Folkung"
Eskil, talk to him!
I know what your love for Cecilia
means to you, Arn ...
Believe me, I know
... but there is something to what Brosa is saying.
There is a lot to what Brosa says.
It would be best if you married
one of  Sverker's daughters
Brosa is right
If we do not watch our step,
and tie the right connections,
We may well be on the threshold of war
I have sworn an oath in front of God,
...to marry Cecilia.
A holy oath, Brosa.
You can not change that.
Arn Magnusson,
Cecilia Algotsdotter -
... that I woulld marry Cecilia.
- It is a great joy and a relief
that I finally can give you my blessing.
Cheers!
Magnus.
- Father.
Look around. Everyone is having a good time
like there was no tomorrow.
Brosa would have enjoyed this.
- Magnus tried to persuade him.
I didn't think he could resist
So much ale and pork.
It is a great...
It is a great honour to
be able to be here today.
With so beautiful and good
men and women.
Not in the least that man there.
The greatest warrior in the North.
If you ever need a
Archer, my dear friend -
then you know that
Harald Ãysteinsson will always be there.
So on behalf of Norway...
Beloved Arn, beloved Cecilia.
Good luck and cheers!
Are you cold?
- No.... No...
- No, this is to hot.
- Yes.
Have we changed that much?
Our souls are the same.
You are the Cecilia, that I remember.
Our new home, Cecilia.
Here we will build and work for peace.
I would never have imagined
that it would be this big.
Everyone here is a free man
with a lot of new knowledge.
You could not have chosen better,
this is a good place.
- This is Sune Folkesson.
- Welcome to Forsvik, Cecilia.
Now I will show you where we will live.
What do you think?
Birch trees...
Very nice.
- Yes, and look here!
A gift from our Saracen friends.
We are the first in west Gothia with
our own stream in our house.
and a birchwood in our bedroom.
6 years later.
Father!
Father! Father!
Are you going out shooting with Sune?
Then father will continue training the men.
Get going then.
Sigge!
Your turn.
Aim for the middle.
Not to bad.
Now it is my turn.
You will have to find that arrow.
Get going.
Don't come back without it
trouble maker!
Alde!
Sten, have you seen Alde?
Yes, a moment ago.
- Alde!
Women and children inside
Get inside!
Get Arn.
Is this your beautiful mother?
Let her go!
The famous templar...
- If you have something to say,
then say it now without dismounting.
We where just passing
and met your daughter in the woods.
I was almost hit by an arrow.
It is hard to separate friend from foe.
You should keep better watch of your family, Arn.
The forest isn't safe any more.
Especially not now as your King,
Knut is on his deathbed.
Why has no one told me this?
- I didn't want it to get out, I did not want any unrest.
Unrest! Yes unrest.
Knut is my oldest friend.
While you argue, Sverker Karlsson
may have taken Visingsoe.
You have been fighting for six years.
It is about time you two make peace.
How long does he have?
I don't know. He shits blood
and that is never a good sign.
Sverker Karlsson has appointed
Ebbe Sunesson as marshall.
And he has got the backing of the Danish King.
And all of the Danish army.
We are not ready to meet
the Danes on the battlefield.
We must buy some time.
- There is only one solution.
What?
There is only one solution.
We must relinquish the crown.
Arn!
Erik, take me to your father.
We have no choice.
We Offer Sverker Karlsson the throne -
as long as Erik will be his successor.
- Yes.
If we can get Knut to agree.
Arn...
I came when I heard.
Why is God punishing me like this?
Letting me die in my own feces. Like satans hounds.
- Father don't blaspheme.
Don't worry my son.
The Bishop is on his way here.
He will get me over on the other side.
I know why you are here, Arn.
You want Sverker Karlsson
to take the crown.
Am I right?
It is the only solution.
That or war.
- What will happen to Erik??
Our condition is that Sverker Karlssons
heirs will be without inheritance -
and Erik becomes successor.
You must stand by him, Arn, no matter what.
If Sverker Karlsson touches
even a hair on Erik's head -
Promise to stand behind him
with your sword?
You have my word.
That is good.
That is good.
Hurry, get on the dock.
The King's sword.
May I introduce my brothers friends.
Eskil Magnusson, lord of Arnaes.
Arn Magnusson, lord of Forsvik.
- Arn Magnusson.
Your reputation preceeds you.
And yours follow you, Sverker Karlsson.
I have heard that you are a man
that chooses his own path.
I walk the same path as my clan.
My King.
I value my friendship with the Folkung clan greatly
And so does my Jarl.
Isn't that true, Erik?
I must return to Forsvik.
I would like you and your sons to come back with me.
- Tell Cecilia not to worry about me.
I promised Knut that I would watch over Erik.
- Erik is Jarl heir to the throne.
His place is here at Visingsoe.
I will not give Sverker Karlsson the
pleasure of our running away.
Blanka is to brave for her own good.
Sverker Karlsson
can not be trusted.
He would not hesitate to harm Erik.
No, that is what I am afraid of.
We can not just leave them at Visingsoe.
We must send someone to watch over them.
Someone we trust.
You leave Forsvik tonight.
It is not a small thing I am asking of you,
But we must protect the heir to the throne.
At Forsvik they hated me
For my danish blood.
I never had the chance
to prove my worth.
-And what is your worth?
-I am a good soldier.
A good soldier? You couldn't even
watch a little brat in the forest.
Maybe I didn't want to watch her...
A traitor... I should hang you.
But it would probably please the King,
to have a Folkung in his force.
Welcome.
look at him.
Get up,
So we can look at a Jarl.
Look at him.
Look at him!
Look at Erik our Jarl.
He looks like a drunk... arrow.
Sverker!
Is that how a King speaks to his Jarl?
Cecilia Blanka must have forgotten
that she is no longer queen.
Sverker Karlsson has shown great
generosity by letting you stay here.
And what does he get in return?
Ungreatfullness.
You are very beautiful.
But as my marshall says.
I have no reason
to be thankfull to you.
I have no reason to show you hospitality.
You can leave.
- Come.
- Alone!
Your sons are old enough
to be without their mother.
One, two, three. Good.
five! six! one! two...
I have seen so much evil.
So much death.
I prayed to God, that I would never have to
experience war again.
But if Sverker draws his sword,
Then the war is here. - I am also here.
I am with you every moment.
God has a special task for you.
- To go to war?
To make peace.
My Marshall believes that you serve two masters.
And what does the King think?
I have not made up my mind yet.
You have served me well, in my army,
but I trust my Marshall.
I have only one master.
King Sverker.
Good. Then I will let you prove it.
Tonight you will tell Knut's sons
that you belong to the Folkung clan -
and that you will help them to escape.
Tonight you will take them out of the castle.
Down by the water two men
are waiting with a boat.
Take them far out to sea...
And drown them.
The two men that are with you, have orders
to kill you, if you do not cooperate.
After this, I will decide, what
I think of you, Sune Folkesson.
Here ends the Journey my little lords.
Sit down.
- Don't touch him!
-Shut up!
- Damned traitor!
I am only doing my duty.
He is wounded.
Let me see.
He will be allright.
Where is Litlle-Knut?
Sverker Karlsson
has lost his right to the crown.
Now he fears our vengence.
The Danes will be here soon.
It will take more than willpower
and courage from us, to defeat them.
But I promise you,
we will be prepared.
God be with you, Magnus.
I know, you will be back.
I am to old for this.
You have my men.
Every slave and stable boy
who can draw a bow is here.
We will never win.
The Danish outnumber us five to one.
We will strike them with an
unexpected force.
Sverker Karlsson is a dead king.
I will kill him myself.
It is not a small thing to kill a King.
No matter how unworthy. Revenge calls for revenge
Do you want to loose another brother?
He is just as stubborn as his father.
Just like you where.
I want peace, Eskil.
That is what my prayers are about.
I am proud of you, little brother.
Everything is ready.
I don't know...
Our men are afraid.
Listen!
Do not doubt.
Have faith!
Faith in our victory!
We chose this place,
not the Danes, not Sverker.
We chose this time,
not the Danes, not Sverker.
Faith!
God is with the one
who stands firm in faith.
This is why we will win... peace!
Send the heavy cavalry.
- Riders!
Forward!
First formation - forward!
How will you win this?
Don't you think the dane will see
through this ruse?
- We shall see.
Are they trying to scare us?
Wait for my signal, Harald.
Ready!
Attack!
Ready!
Wait...
Now!
A trap...
Now!
Get ready again!
Attack!
Now!!!
ATTACK!!!
Norge!
- Kill him!
- Do it!
He killed my brother
- Yes, and your father killed his father.
You are the king now, Erik.
King!
Ride away from here!
I will never leave you again.
Are you hurt?
Arn... Arn!
Our Lady did not forsake us.
I love you.
I love you...
Arn Magnusson's wish for peace
was fullfilled many years later
By his grandson Birger Jarl.
He united the kingdom
and called it Sverige. (Sweden)
ARN - The kingdom at the roads end.
