No, I mean...

him The Grabber.

She's fine.
You know what this is about.
What did you say to Amy

Just that I had a
dream about him.
What kind of a dream?
Just a weird one.
What happened in your dream?
He was taken. That's all.
By a man with black
balloons in a van.
Yes.
WRIGHT: What else can you
tell us about your dream?
Why? It was just a dream.
MILLER: Who else
knows about the dream?
Nobody.
We found two black balloons
at the scene, Gwen.
Oh.
We also found one black
balloon at the scene
of Griffin Stagg's abduction.
And we never released
those details, so...
So the question is, where did
you hear about the balloons?
I didn't.
I'm gonna ask you again.
How did you know
about the balloons?
What aren't you
telling us, Gwen?
Either there's a leak in the
department, or...-Or what?
I'm The Grabber?
- WRIGHT: No.
You think I kidnapped
Vance Hopper last spring?
Is that it?
Vance got held back twice.
I've seen him
fight, and trust me,
he could kick the shit out
of either of you blindfolded.
Gwen, watch your language.
Yeah, I took him down 'cause
obviously I'm The Grabber,
you dumb fucking fart knockers.
Gwendolyn Blake!

What aren't you telling us?
That sometimes my
dreams are right.
There he is.

You've always been

You were always afraid
to throw a punch,
but you always knew
how to take one.
And you always got
back up every time.
I'm not strong enough.
You have to be. You're
getting out of here.
If you can't do it
for you, do it for me.
What does it matter?
Because I don't want
to die for nothing.
I want to at least
have died for a friend.
And because I can't
kill that hijo de puta,
you have to do it for me.
How?
You're gonna use a weapon.

Our community's long nightmare
has finally come to a
bittersweet end tonight
with the rescue of the
missing Blake child
but also the discovery
of five bodies
we believe to be the other
missing children in the area.
Here are the facts of the
case by the men who broke it.
- Detective Wright?
- Thanks, Chief.
The perpetrator known as
The Grabber owned two homes,
one where he kept the
victims while alive
and a second empty
home across the street
where he buried them postmortem.
(school bell ringing)
(students murmuring)
- Is that him?
- That's him.
Oh, shit.
- Did you see him?
- I thought he would be bigger.
He's the one who
killed The Grabber.
- That's him.
- No way.
The Grabber was like
seven feet tall.
I heard he stabbed him.
How could that kid
strangle him to death?
- It was an axe to the head.
- My dad's a cop. I know.
I heard he beat him
to death with a phone.
