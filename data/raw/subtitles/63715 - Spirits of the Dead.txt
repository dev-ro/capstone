SPIRITS 0F THE DEAD
Hughes!
Hughes!
Are the horses ready?
Whenever you wish, Madam.
Get them, now!
Your guests are still in bed,
Milady.
I slept badly last night!
Wake them! I need fresh air!
I want to ride, to forget
this dream I had!
Are you sure it was a dream?
Sometimes you need me...
to tell you what you did
was real.
Get out!
You're always lurking about!
At the age of twenty-two,
Frederique,
Countess of Metzengerstein
inherited the entire family fortune.
Rarely had a noble of this land
come into such a legacy.
She ruled over it capriciously:
Both night and day
according to her whim.
That morning, haunted by her
nightmare of the dawn,
she decided to take her guests
to the castle
where she had spent
her childhood.
Marquis!
Give me something to drink!
Blood!
Swine!
Milady!
What! Can't I enjoy myself?
Surely one can still laugh.
I love this place.
It's beautiful!
You have ten finer castles.
Finer than childhood?
Fool!
Is that boy still annoying you?
Shall I throw him out?
And supposing he flies...
It would be a pity!
Shoot straight and true!
The cord must break!
Shameful debaucheries,
flagrant treacheries,
unheard of cruelties soon taught
her vassals
that nothing
could guarantee them security
against the remorseless fangs
of this petty Caligula.
Come!
Come on!
Give me the necklace, boy!
- Is this our room?
- I have a surprise for you.
What is it?
There she is.
Don't be silly!
I knew him long before you did!
The other way!
All encouraged her in her whims,
not only her depraved friends,
but many others who feared
her displeasure.
The sole exception to this rule,
was the less well to do branch
of their related Berlifitzing
family,
who were traditional enemies
of the Metzengersteins,
and openly critical
of Frederique's behavior.
These two families had been
locked in discord for centuries,
and their deadly enmity
reaching so far back
that none could remember
its origins.
At this time the young
Baron Wilhelm of Berlifitzing
lived alone in his family's
castle.
Although he was her closest
neighbor,
he had never spoken to his
appalling cousin,
Frederique of Metzengerstein.
For her part, Frederique, if
by chance she caught sight
of her cousin from afar,
would mock at him and openly
show her scorn.
But Wilhelm seemed not to
notice her.
His lively intelligence would have
made him a great success in society
but nothing interested this
young misanthropist
who divided his life between
hunting and his stables.
Help me!
Quickly!
If I find the idiot who
set this trap,
he'll be flogged for two hours
and I'll apply the vinegar
myself.
Hurry!
And stop staring!
When a vixen gets caught,
she plays dead.
0pen the trap, and she runs off,
even if she's injured.
Does it hurt?
Chance alone brought Frederique
and Wilhelm together.
The girl would have preferred
to hate this face
that she knew not, but instead
she was unable to forget it.
Something within her had changed.
Haunted by the memory of
a gloomy, mocking glance,
she had but one desire- to see
Wilhelm again.
Hunting the vixen,
Wilhelm Berlifitzing?
Sultan!
Sultan!
He'll be back.
I'm cold!
A Metzengerstein offers
his cloak to a lady.
You don't, apparently!
You never speak, Cousin.
My ankle still hurts
from the trap.
Prince!
Do you only speak to animals?
Come this evening.
You'll find what you need.
Most of my guests are boars,
buzzards and bears.
It should amuse you.
I won't be part of
your collection.
I'm not accustomed to being
refused.
- Do not keep bad habits.
- Who do you think you are?
A happy man.
Frederique!
Wilhelm!
Rejected and ridiculed when
she'd never been so sincere
Frederique angrily suppressed
the emotions
that had drawn her towards
her cousin.
Hughes!
Her only thoughts were
her vengeance.
Hughes!
Yes, Milady?
How did he come here?
He galloped here through
the flames.
- Whose is he?
- Nobody knows.
Not even the Baron Wilhelm's
servants.
No one knows this horse.
- No one can approach him!
- I'll try.
Milady...
The Baron Wilhelm is dead!
What?
He tried to save the horse
he loved and died.
Everything went up in flames.
Everything.
Hughes!
Hughes!
Hughes!
Yes?
You will repair this...
as it was before.
But that's impossible, Madam!
You will, because I wish it!
Find the best tapestry-maker.
Frederique had ordered the stables
to be set on fire
without imagining that
Wilhem would perish in the flames.
His death satisfied neither her
love, nor her bitterness.
She felt a dark foreboding.
Terror took hold of her.
What are you thinking?
Nothing. Go on.
From that time forth, a marked
change took place
in the outward behavior
of the young libertine.
She no longer left her estate,
excluding all companions.
Qr could the wild, unearthly
horse that she rode constantly
have claimed some mysterious
right of friendship...
Frederique remained faithful
to him.
In the glare of noon,
at the dead hour of night,
in sickness or in health,
in calm or in tempest,
Frederique seemed riveted to the
saddle of that colossal horse,
his audacities so well
accorded with her own spirit.
0ld man, will it take long?
I don't know.
Some days, the threads sing.
0n others, they resist
and tie themselves in knots.
I asked you how long.
Weeks... months perhaps.
This spell, which she accepted
with all her being,
reached even
into her solitary moments.
She would spent hours before
the tapestry
that was slowly taking shape.
Fascinated, she watched
the agile hands of the old man,
bringing back to life
the great black steed.
His fingers, so deftly knotting
the threads,
seemed to be weaving with
a fatal logic,
her own destiny.
Help me now, my hands.
You always served me well.
Do not betray me.
Have you worked it out?
- Is it blood?
- No, fire!
Frederique had accepted
and now desired her own end.
She rushed toward the flames.
Like Wilhelm, with Wilhelm,
she will die by fire.
- I want to confess!
- After Mass. People are waiting.
- No! Right away!
- Please...
- After Mass.
- Now, I said!
Proceed.
I don't know how.
Tell me what to do. Help me.
I'm not a Catholic.
In that case, my son,
we'll talk after Mass.
I want to confess,
you must hear me!
Do not shout.
You're in God's house.
I don't care about God!
I need to understand.
I want to talk.
I've killed a man.
Someone from this town?
I don't know...
I don't think so.
- Ah, a stranger?
- Yes.
Well... no. I know him.
I have always known him.
You're drunk!
Listen to me!
It's your duty.
Why did you kill him?
I'll tell you everything,
from the beginning.
Franz von Lowenstein.
William Wilson!
It's from Italy.
It must be from your Mother.
Attention!
At ease.
Silence! Stop that!
Wilson did it!
Wilson!
Down.
Up.
Down.
Up.
Down!
Who's that?
He's the new boy.
- What is your name?
- Wilson. William Wilson.
- What's your name again?
- William Wilson.
His name was Wilson?
The same as yours?
Same name, precisely.
- A coincidence.
- Unacceptable.
Power cannot be shared.
Suddenly I had a rival.
A rival, or rather a companion
who beat me in everything,
but who watched me
from a benevolent distance.
He exasperated me
but I felt extremely curious
about him.
Good God!
Wilson!
You again, as usual!
We were both expelled.
It took me a long time to forget.
0bviously this childhood incident
has always haunted you.
- Before you leave...
- Let me finish!
Several years later
I enrolled in medicine,
out of curiosity.
I remind you that a doctor
is also a sorcerer.
We shall seek life
in the depths of matter.
And now I have the pleasure
of dissecting before you
a human body
which has always been
the dream of priests,
poets or philosophers.
To be precise, I shall open
a human heart.
If we were dealing with
a live body,
we'd process in this fashion.
Going laterally from the sternum,
between the 6th and 7th rib,
we'd find the apex of the heart.
But in the present case,
we shall section
all the ribs of the sub-auxiliary
region on the left
and the right
as far as the sternum.
Then we will separate
the diaphragm
and fold back the rib cage.
This will reveal the contents
of the thoracic cavity.
The heart, gentlemen,
is a hollow muscle
composed essentially of a firm
ventricular mass
and a softer auricular mass.
This pump
which gives forth
as much as it receives,
has come to be seen
as a symbol
of courage and generosity.
Does Mr. Wilson have
a comment?
No. In that case,
we may proceed.
Thank you!
Even in dealing with a corpse,
always be sure of the
cleanliness of your instruments.
It is said, gentlemen,
that the heart is the seat of
the emotions, the passions.
Indeed.
But experience shows that it is
the seat of our cares,
our sorrows.
Its only generosity lies
in the suffering it gives.
So, when we have cut the ribs,
separated the diaphragm
and folded back what is
commonly called the rib cage,
we can deliver our patient
from the source of her woes.
The doctor is a benefactor.
We will thus bring her relief.
Along with the heart...
No!
We'll remove despair
and the pain of love.
Gentlemen, we shall restore her
her pristine purity,
the peace of paradise lost.
Even if it's a living person,
make sure your instruments
are perfectly clean.
Here, put this on!
Cover yourself.
Did she die?
Forget about the girl!
It's him, don't you see?
I had to leave the University,
and I joined the Austrian Army.
To fight.
But no one fights anymore.
The twin garrison is infamous.
Thanks to me.
People have told me all about
the trouble. The poor women.
All was well...
until that night.
Don't. It's Wilson!
You recognize me?
I'm flattered.
There were many of us
the other night.
It was dark,
and you were so busy.
Good evening, Mr Wilson.
- Is that Wilson?
- Be careful, Tonina.
This Wilson is surely not
the lover you dream of.
He's made his reputation
from men...
not from us.
He loves parades, the theater,
dressing up.
He needs an audience.
But in private,
he puts on a poor show.
- Have you met him before?
- No... and I don't want to.
I hate wasting my time.
- Are you referring to me?
- You... you.
You are not the only
man alive, Wilson.
Are you taunting me?
Are you threatening me?
I'm challenging you.
Ace.
She loved cards. But I could
always keep my hand up.
I decided to teach her a lesson.
Court card!
Two hundred.
Double.
I'll see you.
Ace, Jack.
Wilson has lost.
Are you sure?
Ace, King.
I thought you were bluffing.
Bluff and window-dressing...
That's you, Wilson.
