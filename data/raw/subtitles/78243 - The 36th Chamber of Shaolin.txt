THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN
Good luck, General Yin.
A man must do or die
Mr. Ho, before I left,
Lord Cheng is concerned about you.
If he can strike back with his army
and defeat the tartars, -
credit for Canton will be yours
One must sacrifice for one's country
The 6 brothers arrested by tartars
Were tortured but have so far, -
but refused to make a confession.
This is most admirable
If I failed,
I wouldn't even get arrested.
General Yin.
- Mr. Ho, please.
Sirs
When Inspector-general.
And General Tien Ta arrive, -
please say a good word for me.
Don't worry, Mr. Magistrate.
General Tien Ta ordered us
to capture the 6 traitors
The Inspector Will supervise the execution
Yes, yes...
Tang San-yao, it's almost 12:30 p.m.
Don't forget the General's command
The Inspector-general is here!
Make way...
We're trapped!
General Yin, I knew you'd be here
to "welcome" the Inspector-general.
But he has not yet reached Canton!
Stop!
Your skill is comparable to a general.
Let's have a fair fight:
A General to a General.
Let me try you out
Good, I need a substitute.
Let me fight you single-handedly
Quiet down!
The teacher's here...
The teacher's here, hurry up...
Mr. Ho
Mr. Ho
Please have tea, Mr. Ho.
Mr. Ho, why are you so late?
Did you go to see the execution?
Leave me alone!
Executions should be interesting
Lin Zhen, it depends on who it is.
If it is the tartars who invaded us
Of course it is interesting
But today's convicts are patriots
They are all Han's martyrs
Do you still think it is interesting?
I...
Yesterday, I taught you sacrifice
For the sake of a righteous cause
Do you all understand?
Yes
Hurry up... It's here
Is he dead or alive?
He's so stiff, of course he's dead.
He's a hero
What did you say?
I...
- Capture him!  - Yes
You're an accomplice.
- Lord Tang... Listen to me
This student is not a bad man.
He's the son of a seafood shop owner
Son of a shop owner?
- Yes, exactly.
These are his classmates.
- Yes, we're his classmates
Where are you studying?
They all study in Chong Wen College
Are you vouching for them, Mr. Wang?
Yes. Apologize to Lord Tang
I...
You're too young and gauche.
Always causing trouble
Do you know who I am?
I do. Tang San-yao, Lord Tang.
Yes, let's go, quickly!
Uncle Wang, we didn't do anything!
Yes, I know.
Tang San-yao's notorious
for his craze after money and women
You mustn't antagonize him.
As the saying goes:
"One must humble oneself under enemy's rule"
Mr. Ho... please open the door!
Who is it?
Mr. Ho
Mr. Ho
What's wrong?
I...
There's something we can't understand
So we've come here even at this hour
Humble oneself under enemy's rule
Do we and our children have to
humble ourselves forever?
I say, we'd be beheaded if we don't.
If we fear not death we don't have to
You're right. It's well said
One brave man alone is not enough
But unity is strength
The tartars are well-armed.
We...
Men owes allegiance to his country
Lord Cheng is recruiting in Taiwan
He's become tartar's biggest trouble
The Manchurian emperor has ordered -
coastal residents to move away
and to be on their guard.
Mr. Ho, I wish Lord Cheng could use us.
The day will come.
Don't you all want to help?
Yes
Good. Come here.
- Yes
Secret documents will arrive by sea
I need a way to bypass customs.
Liu Yu-de, doesn't your pa run
a seafood shop?  - Yes
Open sesame...
- Shut sesame...
Mr. Ho sent us here.
- Good
Little brother, you're a brave fellow.
Lock it up...
Yes, hurry...
Pa, has San Li's abalone arrived?
The abalone... Go, go now!
It has... The sea cucumber has too...
Te, what are you doing?
A big order for abalone was placed.
I am showing them some samples
So you're in business now?
Te, you can't take the whole case.
- I'm in a hurry to deliver it
Hurry? Do you know the market price?
The quality's high. Raise the price
Open it.
- Yes
Excellent kung fu.
- You'll find that at Shaolin Temple
Mr. Ho, we could invite them to...
Yes
They don't involve in worldly matters
If Shaolin taught kung fu to laymen -
people could fight the tartars.
That would be great!
Yue Shan, South gate...
Here
General Tien
- Arise
Come over here
Lately, we've suppressed rebels -
and found this on their leaders:
Zheng Cheng-gong's edict
Look, what have you been doing?
There must be many of Cheng's men
hiding in Canton
We must capture the rebels
And kill them to scare them off
Who's that?  - No idea.
He's secretive, maybe a spy.
I'm innocent. I'm a delivery boy.
I've brought dried fish. Look!
Shut up
Lord Zheng, notorious rebels...
Who told you to bring this here?
No... no use to ask me
Kid, we'll take you away
And torture you one after another
See if you'll talk or not.
I'll talk... Don't torture me.
I... I say, there is someone
Go on with the torture -
if you like!
I saw a squadron of Ching troops
of over 100 patrolling our alley
Mr. Ho, what shall we do?
We must keep calm and be on the alert
Yien-pin, let them hide in your home.
Mr. Ho, what about you...?
Mr. Ho, Mr. Ho
Go quickly, go!  - What about you?
-Hurry up, quick
Master, look!
Please have mercy... please talk to them
Please ask them not to...
- Quiet!
General's order: No dried fish.
Then...
What's your relationship to Liu Yu-de?
He... he's my son.  - Bring him here
- He's not home...
Why do you want him?
- We've uncovered many spies recently
One's a teacher; another's his pupil
Liu Yu-de's a pupil of that school
We'll capture him and torture him!
Master, our young master won't...
Please have mercy
How do you know he wouldn't?
- Let's talk it over
Pa...
- Yu-de, run quickly... Yu-de
Young Master, run, run quickly...
Run quickly, Young Master
You want to rebel?
Yu-de, run quickly, run!
He's innocent! My son!
Liu Yu-de, come up quickly!
My son is innocent, my son!
Change your clothes at once
- I...
All wearing school uniform arrested
Wonder what's happened to my home?
- Try to find a hiding place first
We can find out later.
- Right, let's go now
What has happened to my home?
Your home...
- Tell me!
All the houses in the street next
to your home have been cordoned off
What about my father?
Pa...
Don't be sad. It's the same for mine
I wish I had learned kung fu
instead of studying
So I could fight them
Studies teach us right from wrong
What's the use of that?
We can't talk sense with the tartars
We can't stay in this town anymore
The martial arts headquarters is...
Shaolin Temple
We're lucky we made it
Let's go straight on
Did you see a group of men riding by?
Why don't you answer me?
Let's go!
Dismount and chase them
These two must be traitors
One watch the horses, others chase
Hurry up
Let's go
Liu Yu-de, mount it!
Liu Yu-de?
Liu Yu-de, escape now. Go!
Don't let him get away
Liu Yu-de, good luck!
Please give me some water
Thank you, uncle
How far is it to Shaolin Temple?
It's not far, only up the mountain.
But you look like you can't make it.
I can... even if I have to crawl there!
Sit down.
I don't think you can.
Shaolin monks buy food here everyday
Their cart is over there
Hurry up... Do it orderly and quickly
Get going, go!
Why is it so heavy?
Yes, I don't know why. Go.
You'll be punished if you're late.
Let's go, quick!
Push harder, harder, go!
Hurry up, park the cart there
Come and lend a hand, everybody
Why are you standing there, come here.
Take this to the kitchen. Be quick.
Why are you so slow?
Hurry up...
What's the matter?
What's that man doing there?
Stay calm, he can still be saved.
Bring him inside. I'll tell the abbot
Sir, the abbot would like to see you.
- Thank you
This temple is not a sanctuary.
You're spiteful and emotional.
Unfit to stay in the temple.
You're recovering, please leave soon
I had so much difficulty coming here.
I won't leave!
Don't be rude.
- Splendid
Since you are here...
It means you've affinity with Buddha.
Brother, you mustn't make exceptions.
He arrived here in a coma,
but woke up after 10 days.
Perseverance to Buddhism
warrants his admittance.
Dharma also came to the east
with such perseverance -
and laid the foundation of Shaolin.
What are your opinions, brothers?
You're right, brother.
Thank you abbot.
Morning, sir.
San Te, San Te
Morning, sir.
How long have you been here?
- Over a year
Are you unable to endure destitution?
No, not that, but...
Don't hide anything from the Buddha
Before I came here, I heard Shaolin
is the headquarters of kung fu
But for the past year, I've only cleaned
I haven't seen any kung fu
You can learn kung fu if you want to
As long as they want to, any monk
can learn from the 35 chambers.
If you don't tell us who would know?
Why do you want to learn kung fu?
Honestly, sir
Before I came here, -
I saw the people,
oppressed by tyrannical rule.
If they were able to learn kung fu,
they could defend themselves.
And combat enemies. Therefore...
Good, good, San Te
Buddhists shouldn't bear such thought.
Don't mention it again!
I won't be shaken.
I am determined
Sir, can I still learn kung fu?
There're 35 chambers in Shaolin.
Which chamber do you want to start?
Which is the most advanced?
The top chamber, of course!
Then I'll start from the top
Sir
Behold, the Buddha says:
Emptiness is the Eternal Five
No sight, sound, smell, taste, sense.
The five flavors dull the taste
The five tones deafen the ear
The five colors blind the eye
It can also not be seen
But it won't pass away
Being at one is eternal
But all things will come to you
Without wisdom... without...
Leave!
No wisdom, no gain
Gaining is not continuant
All men will come to me one
For there lies rest
And happiness and peace
It's invisible and inaudible
And it's inexhaustible
Can you hear the sound of bells?
The heart is calm. We hear nothing
How often do you recite the sutras?
I... I...
Go away!
Sir, I came to learn martial arts.
Get out!
No one learns martial arts here
This is the most advanced field
You won't understand it
I'm willing to start from the bottom
Cross the pond to enter dining hall
- Yes
Brother, this is the 35th chamber?
Shut up. You starve if you're late
Pure body is light, steps are stable.
Don't enter the hall if you're dirty.
How dare you enter this dining hall?
Sir, I want to...
- Have congee?
Come with me
Stand on the wood
Jump!
Turn around!
Eat!
Get up, you're hopeless.
Clean all the pottery and cutlery
Wall is low, power of Buddha is high.
He's fallen into it
Don't laugh, he's only a novice.
Enter the dining hall
San Te, you're terrific...
Concentrate. You'll find a way
Keep practicing day and night. Go!
Stop!
Wood drifts, its buoyancy is limited.
Harder you step, faster it sinks.
San Te.  - Yes
Throw the plate hard into water
The plate sinks down in water
just like the wood you stepped upon.
I keep the plate in motion, balanced.
Similarly, step fast, balance body.
Uniformity of mind
brings uniformity of maneuver.
You must keep this point in mind
Strength, balance, speed.
Strength, balance, speed. Right
Sir, I...
- Go!
I beg you to teach me, master.
34th chamber practice arms' strength
Fist, palm, knife, sword, pole, spear
All depend on arm strength. Look...
This is the basic process:
Carry the water up the slope
Pour it down to keep it flowing.
Remember, arms must be straight.
You should carry water everyday
to build up arm strength. Go now.
I didn't think you'd make it so soon.
Don't help others when they practice.
It'll only ruin them
You've violated our rule. Leave...
Sir...
- Go to the 33rd Chamber
Thank you, sir
This chamber is comparatively easier
Whenever you hear me knock the wood -
Strike the gong.
Sir, I'm here to learn kung fu, not...
Don't little the bamboo poles. Ji Wei
The hammer weighs 10 catties
It is fitted into a 12-ft pole
A 12-ft pole and 10-catty hammer
now weighs 120 catties
How much can your wrists bear?
I'm willing to try
Add on 2 more feet
Ready...
Keep practicing
My respects to the abbot
You've left the Wrist Room?
- Yes, the overseer said I could leave.
Good. Starting today...
As a reward for your diligence
You'll be in charge of Sutra Room.
Thank you, abbot.
Brother, San Te is ambitious
He's not like our Buddhist brothers
It's peaceful here in this temple
But outside it's turbulent
We may need someone like him
Please guide me, sir.
Stand between the two burning incense
- Yes
Anyone practicing martial arts
must be sharp-eyed. Watch the lamp
When the lamp oscillates...
Your eyes should follow
But remember
Your head must not move.
Start!
Told you not to move your head.
Again
Right, the target has disappeared, -
but still, the eyes shouldn't move.
Eyes be bright, limbs be nimble.
This is the way to do it
- Yes
Turn around
San Te, hit the reflecting blocks.
You're my most outstanding pupil
Thank you, sir.
Head Chamber
Continue
Don't lower your head. Stand up
Hands on your waist.
Use your head to hit the sand bags
Then burn incense before the Buddha
- Yes
Again
Get up
Sir, I...
- Collapsing so quickly?
Get up now. Continue. Go on
Sir
San Te. Only after 2 years hard work -
you might be able to enter this alley.
San Te, head is the most important
And the last phase in the training
After going through it,
you can learn fighting and weapons
Offer the incense
Use your strength to hit it. Get up!
You've set a new record
You've completed the basic skills
of the 10 chambers in 25 months' time
I can't do it without the teachers
You can now practice boxing...
Knife, baton and other skills
- Yes
Justice Officer
I'll make him head of Dharma House
San Te, greet these two abbots.
- Yes
Stop!
Continue!
San Te!
Leg Chamber
Sir
- San Te, not bad, not bad
Sword Chamber
Turn around faster
Good fellow
San Te
San Te, it's commendable of you
to master all 35 chambers of kung fu...
In only 5 years.
Now I'll make you deputy overseer
of any of the 35 chambers
Brother, San Te's post is high enough.
He's been promoted 8 times in 5 years
With his present skill he is
qualified to be deputy overseer
Shaolin arts has existed for 1000 years
We mustn't make a hasty decision
In my opinion...
Let him fight me with any weapon
If he succeeds, he can be an overseer.
You heard what he said
What do you think?
I dare not
It's my idea. If you win...
you can take charge of any chamber
Excuse me then, sir.
Watch out
Thank you, sir. I've lost
You may challenge me any time
How many times have I tapped you?
- 17 times
I could've hurt you with the blade
You're right.
I'll continue with my practice
Brother, I think he'll never win.
- Not necessarily
What weapon is San Te using?
A two-jointed bar made by himself
Good, that blow was not bad.
Go on!
Sir, are you alright?
San Te, I still have my weapons.
Excuse me
Abbot, San Te can take
charge of any chamber.
San Te, choose to take charge of
any of the 35 chambers...
except the Top Chamber.
Your Buddhism attainment is
not advanced enough
Abbot, I've not yet made up my mind.
Never mind. I'll give you 3 days
Thank you, abbot.
There're only 35 chambers in Shaolin
There isn't a 36th chamber
I know. I'd like to create it...
This 36th chamber is...
It's a pity Shaolin martial arts
is confined solely to the temple.
It should be taught widely to all
That's my idea for the new chamber
To teach martial arts to laymen
We don't involve in worldly affairs
Nor do we admit secular pupils
Forget it
Abbot, this affects the handing down
of Shaolin martial arts to posterity.
Please let me enroll promising youths -
And train them in the 36th chamber.
Nonsense, how dare you talk back?
I don't mean to...
- Shut up!
I must ask you to reconsider, abbot.
Justice Officer
Our pupil San Te should be punished.
- Yes
San Te, you've violated our rule.
You have to collect contributions
Don't return unless the book is full.
Yes. Abbot, I deserve punishment
Leave tomorrow morning
You want to pray for Chiang Tai?
They all died
They were buried in East cemetery
Go there and pray for them
Uncle Wei, may you rest in peace
We will complete your mission
Hung Hsi-kuan, I knew you'd be here
to bury your accomplices.
Run!
Go! See how you can escape.
Good! I'll kill you one after another
Go ahead and try.
Tang San-yao, you're so malicious.
Your vice will be punished.
- Scram, bloody monk.
Master, please stay out of this.
So you're an accomplice
Tang San-yao,
remember 7 years ago -
you confiscated my school and my
shop and killed my whole family?
You're Liu Yu-de, a fugitive!
Get him!
Go help your brothers.
- Okay!
You're a Buddhist, show mercy.
Even Buddha has to conquer evil
A monk should not kill
A monk cannot but I can.
I'll do it!
Tang San-yao, you've killed my men
I'll stab you 1,000 times!
Amitabha Buddha
Thank God. Today, our martyrs
can see you lying dead here
Master, I want to learn martial arts.
Please accept me as your pupil
Good. I've come from Shaolin
to enroll promising youths
Hsi-kuan, is Tien Ta still in Canton?
- Yes
His hand is stained with Han's blood
We must eliminate him at all costs
We'll plan well.
Find a hideout first.
Don't act rashly
Do you know of other ambitious youth?
Yes, Tung Qian-jin is another
Tung Qian-jin, Commander's orders:
Make a batch of wheels
Deliver them within one month.
- I can't, it'll take one year.
One year? Are you turning me down?
Do you want to join the dead?
Want my help?
I'll teach you to be smarter
Beat him up!
Are you going to do it or not?
Not over my dead body
It is better to use the haft
Help!
Do you still want the wheels made?
No, no!  - Damn you!
- Good! Good!
Master, Master!
Master... Let me follow you.
Why?
I admire you. Please teach me.
Please take me as your pupil
Tung Qian-jin, what's wrong with you?
You said you won't admire anyone
and will challenge even the Gods?
Why are you kneeling to a monk now?
What do you know? He's not a monk
He's a Bodhisattva
He only said several words
and I scared the tartars away.
So he's a living Bodhisattva?
I'm only a monk from Shaolin Temple
I taught you to avoid direct contact
They've learned kung fu, you haven't
Using a heavy weapon slows you down
And puts you at a disadvantage.
- Right.
Lu Ah-cai, are you convinced now?
Master, it makes sense.
Lu Ah-cai, can you move?
Lu Ah-cai, don't make hasty moves.
Master, I'm convinced.
Master, I'm convinced.
Are you sure now?
- I am, I'm convinced
Master, please come in for some tea.
Master, I'm really convinced.
How did Tang San-yao die?
You still haven't found out yet?
He was chopped by a knife
I only want the man who chopped him.
Yes, we're investigating
Kill all suspects!
- Yes
You must be on alert.
Yes
This is General Tien Ta's residence
He patrols the city every day
And he must pass through this street
when he goes to the city gates.
Shops on both sides of the street
made it difficult for us to get him
Any households on this street?
- Yes
There is a rice-miller's shop
Back to back with General's residence
Are there many people living there?
- There seems to be only one person
Sir...
No one comes for offerings this late
What are you doing? Go away...
What do you mean by that?
Sir, please excuse me.
What do you want?
May I know your name, sir?
My father died
without telling me my name.
So I have no name
I started milling rice when I was six
So they call me Miller Six
I'm San Te. I'm from Shaolin Temple
- People say that monks from Shaolin...
Are excellent at kung fu. No wonder...
I've practiced for several years
Having milled rice for many years
I also have a pair of strong feet.
Do you want to try them?
I've drunk a bit too much today.
But your footwork's not bad
Let's go in for a drink. Let's go!
You can't stay here much longer.
- Why not?
Very soon, something big will
happen in the General's residence
What is it?
General Tien Ta's going to die here
How can you say something like that?
You aren't afraid of being executed?
Leave here at once, will you?
I don't care whether you come from
Shaolin or Linshao Temple
Please just leave. I beg you.
Ching tartars killed so many people
Don't you want to fight back?
I'm only a rice miller. Even if I do...
What can I do?
I'd rather drink
People continue to suffer because
too many people have that attitude.
You'd put it more plainly
I want to borrow your place
No... If you do...
I won't be able to stay here anymore.
Don't worry. I'll take you to Shaolin
Lord Cheng, we caught them
near the cemetery.
Kill them all!  - Yes
Stop!
Lord Cheng, I killed Tang San-yao.
Not them!
You?
How did you kill him?
With this
Take him!  - Yes
Where did you learn it?
In Shaolin Temple
Report to the General! Quick!
- Yes
Master, we're outnumbered.
- Yes, there're so many of them.
Everyday they wake me up early
Will you please calm down?
No, I can't. I'm Miller Six
This is flour
Commanders Tang and Cheng are famous
They failed because of...
If more monks are here
There will be a rebellion in Canton!
- Yes...
I'll bring some men to capture him.
Even if I have to go to Shaolin!
Go, go at once... Run!
Give me a sword
You, a monk, joining the rebels!
A Buddhist has to conquer evil.
How many lives have you taken?
I've killed many, but never a monk.
Stop!
Twist and turn around!
