Any idea what to ask?
'Vanakkam'
We are from Excel Engineering college.
Robotic research students.
We've got an appointment
to meet Dr Vaseegaran.
Please come in.
Dude, soooper hyperbola!
Excuse me You are-
I am Dr Vaseegaran's assistant.
Your name - Nila.
- Beauuuutiful!
- Thanks.
Nila... moon!
What?
It's a lie to say
there's no gravity in the moon.
- Why?
- You are such a magnetic force!
Your laughter can be my ringtone!
Can I have your number?
11423879
Enough! The whole floor is slippery!
Hello, sir.
Please sit down.
Doctor, we are mechatronic students.
Professor Mithra told us you have
created a new humanoid robot.
- Can we take a look at that?
- Sure.
This is the new robot I have created.
Project Nila.
Nice, intelligent, lovely assistant.
Humanoid X12 2018 model.
Quantum Core Millenia.
X12 5D Extreme processor.
Unlimited Cloud memory
1 Tera hertz speed.
Built in simulated Amygdala.
This is her MPU
Memory and Power Unit.
Works like our heart.
MPU!
Synthetic skin.
Ultra realistic humanoid.
You are such a magnetic force!
What about that phone ♪?
That's my IMEI ♪
- Is she also like Chitti, doctor?
- No.
Created adhering to Asimov's laws
this is a domestic purpose robot.
You can treat her as your friend,
secretary and caretaker.
She will be of help to mankind
in all ways and always.
Does it have feelings, doctor?
Yes, pre programmed,
customizable, controlled feelings.
Is there any chance for Chitti
to resurface again, doctor?
All our present scientific inventions
in the beginning were opposed as dangerous.
And labelled as null and void.
Bound by time.
It became a necessity
in the ensuing years.
Chitti will also be a
pre requisite one day.
Dot!
Hey Nikita - Go to hell!
Bulb! Serves you right!
Nikita, hear me out
I acted as if I was flirting with her
just to make you see red.
- As if I didn't know she's a robot?
- 'Get lost, liar!'
My Barbie doll
My Snow White princess!
'Shut up and hang up!'
Believe me, I've booked
an Apple watch for your birthday.
Sushma, Moksha has got
a new Collection today.
You eat and then I'll come over, okay?
My flight was delayed
Inform the clients, I'll be there by-
When I get back from work
I chat with my family nonstop!
We spend quality time you know.
You bloody swine!
Harith, can I have my phone?
Daddy has to make an important call.
Give me the phone.
Don't cry... here.
I didn't do anything.
What is the bid today
in our chit fund?
Can get Rs 3000.
What is this?
Make 'rasam' and potato curry
for dinner, enough.
Grandpa!
'Residing in all of that as Me'
'So that Me through this Me'
'Talking to Me'
Dude, this must be
our principal's handiwork!
Where are you, dear?
Coming to the terrace?
What happened?
Our project manager and
prickly 'Jackfruit' Asha
are hand and glove in this.
That's why he promoted her
and sent her abroad on site.
He went to get the bore-well man
No sign of him still.
Tomorrow is Mahavir Jayanthi
All the shops will be closed.
Buy our stuff tonight, okay?
This phone has 4G, Wifi, Bluetooth
plus dual Sim capacity.
I'm in Ranganathan street,
jam packed with men all around.
Danger Girlfriend calling.
Hi Sana - 'Hi scientist sir'
'Wonder of wonders
You picked my call?'
- Sorry, Sana.
- 'How many calls?'
'Can't you even pick my call?
Are you that busy?'
'Just for your sake I'm 10,000 km away
and studying here like a lunatic'
'Under the pretext of working on
your project, are you flirting with Nila?'
That's a robot, Sana.
'But a female doll, right?'
Don't be mad at me, honey.
'I called you 112 times!'
I'll accept your punishment
and kiss you 112 times.
'No need 112'
'Just 1 phone-kiss, let me see'
Mua-
Flying kiss?!
Sir, where should I complain
to retrieve my mobile?
All of them are waiting too!
Go and stand in the queue.
How can a cell phone fly?
And where will it go?
Who is behind all this?
What is the reason?
'Is a whole gang behind this
or just an individual?'
'This is scary'
Is this a sign our world
will perish as people claim?
Like the ozone hole there is
a black hole in the sky it seems.
It has sucked all the phones I believe.
Yov! Shut up, man.
You're talking as if it's a drainage hole
I'm in the share market
My job is dependent on cell phones.
Life is absolutely boring
without WhatsApp and selfies.
As soon as I wake up
I take my mobile to the loo
I feel I've lost my hand now!
My husband is working in Qatar.
Our long distance romance
is only through cell phone
I've saved my mom's ♪ as 'Amma'
I don't even know her landline ♪ now
I've stored my bank account ♪,
ATM pin ♪, password, the whole works
It has personal videos and photos
of my girlfriend and me.
What if they are uploaded
on an adult site?
Excuse me, is there a separate section
for Android phones?
For sure! It has been opened
in Parthasarathy temple, go there.
Sir, I'm very sentimental
about this cell phone.
Do something, sir.
How can I take this as a complaint?
- Get lost!
- Sir, please
I had hooked my wedding chain
on my mobile, sir
I lost that too
10 sovereign Pure gold, sir.
No wife to nag, no phone bills
to pay, why don't you relax?
God will be appeased if you do
a redemption ritual in Thirunallar, sir.
You and your silly superstitions!
Commissioner sir asked me to meet you
I'll take care, sir.
Thank you.
Telecom minister is on the line.
Sir, even our chief minister
has lost his mobile.
He is on another line.
Your secretary is right here
I'll handle it, sir.
Sir, minister's phone-
I've embedded precious stones all over
0.25 karat, sir
526 stones, sir.
Cost 20 million, sir.
Somehow retrieve it for us, sir.
Okay.
He's chief technical officer of BSNL.
Ramasubramaniam
I heard you're tracking with Sim card.
- What happened, sir?
- It isn't our Govt network alone.
All the other networks too
are unable to track even 1 phone, sir.
All the cell phones
have been switched off.
Every single phone in the city is missing.
How can all of them
be switched off?
How is this possible, sir?
'Vanakkam Headlines'
'Cell phones vanish into thin air
People in panic mode'
'Police department puzzled'
'Chief secretary calls
a special panel to discuss'
'So, doc, I think
you know the situation'
What is this?
What is this phenomenon?
This is strange
I've checked all the NASA studies
and Interpol records.
No one has recorded such an event
anywhere in the world.
There is no scientific explanation
so far for this rare occurrence.
It is so obvious.
This is a terrorist attack.
They are planning something large-scale.
If we can't come up with a reason
it's our habit to blame
either God or terrorists, right?
Can it be the handiwork of aliens
from a different planet maybe?
No, sir.
According to ISRO reports
no new movements or alien activities
have been recorded in space.
Can it be a conspiracy by some
international company in the same field?
I mean, wipe out the present
telephone technology.
And bring in a new
scientific know-how.
This is a public display.
In just 2 days, all the mobiles in the city
flying in mid air like sparrows.
There isn't any technology
like this as far as I know.
May be someone we know here
who botched up a lousy robot earlier.
Some crank scientist
is messing up with some other invention
in the name of novelty, who knows!
Who is this?
Late Mr Bohra AIRD director.
His son Dhinendra Bohra.
Scientist, he's also in AIRD
as senior director.
On the day all the cell phones went missing
data from INSAT 3D weather satellite.
And GSAT 16 communication satellite.
This is the visualization.
All these dots are cell phones.
After a certain distance
the dots vanish into thin air.
Cell phones haven't crossed
the troposphere.
That is, not crossed
10 km above sea level.
If you take the distance into account
not crossed a radius
of 200 km beyond Chennai.
They are all missing
within this sphere somewhere.
We are aware of only 4 forces.
Gravity, electromagnetic,
strong nuclear, weak nuclear.
These 4 won't attract mobile force
I believe this can be
explained scientifically.
Dot!
I believe all the phones in this shop
broke the glass panes and flew out.
Where is the lorry
with the consignment?
'Crossed Nagari' - Doomed!
Not yet crossed Andhra border?
We've advertised tomorrow's sale.
No one has a cell phone in the city.
They will make a beeline to our shop
like devotees in the temple at Tirupati.
'Don't worry, it will be
delivered at 4:00 a.m'
You've been saying this
like a broken record!
(SONG FROM 'ARYA 2')
"I am a modern girl with wanderlust."
Bro, what is that deafening sound?
Songs nowadays are only like this!
Bro...?!
Someone is digging
with a crowbar in our van.
We have only cartons
with cell phones in there.
Call me, as soon as
the truck reaches here.
Have you asked
for police protection?
Paid them, the cops will
be here by 5:00 a.m.
What if all the cell phones we get
for our sale tomorrow fly away?
It means we are jinxed
beyond redemption.
Not only for us
For the entire city
(DOG BARKING)
Lord Muruga
Fountain of knowledge.
Bless everyone with Your grace.
Wha... what is that noise?
'The truck has arrived, sir'
Who is that?
'Arumugam, sir'
'You asked me to call you
as soon as the truck arrives, right?'
- Where?
- 'To your house of course'
Please cooperate.
Go back.
- Commissioner Rajendran asked me to come.
- Please come in.
There is no evidence of human presence
in Jayanth Kumar's murder.
As the deceased is a cell phone merchant
he wanted you to check for clues.
His family members were on a pilgrimage.
He was all alone.
The servants are not aware of anything.
No fingerprint or footprint.
He died exploding
to minuuute pieces.
But there is no evidence
of explosives whatsoever.
He had advertised in the papers
about his Mobile Sale in his shop.
The truck carrying the load
met with an accident.
The entire load went missing.
Nothing makes sense, sir.
Someone or something doesn't like
the presence of cell phones here.
This is silicon, enamel and
polycarbonate dust of 1000s of mobiles.
Different brands
manufactured on different dates.
Will you believe me if I say
Jayanth Kumar was killed by cell phones?
A cell phone is an assassin?
What do you mean, sir?
All the missing cell phones
have landed here.
How did these phones come here?
Where did they go?
We should find out.
Dot!
'Hello scientist, what a surprise!
You've called of your own accord'
Sana, I think you would've heard of
all the cell phones disappearing here.
To trace them, I've fixed a tracker
in my old phone and I've activated it.
'Oh! So am I the guinea pig?'
Not like that, Sana, my phone flew away
before I could send my kisses!
That's why, I thought
I could specially-
'After 3 days, huh?'
'What happened to your landline?
Why didn't you call from that ♪?'
Phone was engaged, Sana.
'Don't pull a fast one'
'Accept you don't remember my ♪'
'Out of sight, out of mind!'
'Now your whole world is Nila'
She's just like a laptop.
'You bet she's on your lap
and you're coddling her 24x7!'
- 'A duet on top of all this!'
- Shut up!
'If I speak the truth,
should I shut up?'
Stop nagging me.
This phone may also fly away!
Mu-
Gone with the wind!
Hey! You're watching too much TV!
Nila, activate EMR.
Activating EMR.
What is happening?
Are they looking for a bomb?
- You search that side.
- Okay, boss.
Thanks, Nila.
Why thank a laptop?!
(OVERLAP OF VOICES)
They are discussing about
your issue inside, wait.
Sir, Onicel owner Manoj Lulla is coming.
He's such a pain!
Good morning.
- Is he in?
- Yes, ji, go in, ji
2G...!
Talk to you later.
- Please sit down.
- I don't need any pacifying.
What are you up to?
Does a Govt exist or not?
Look, Mr Lulla.
Govt and God are one and the same.
If you believe, they exist
If not, they don't.
But you ensure your palms
are greased promptly, eh?
Without exception it has snatched
all my cell phone towers.
Destroyed all the microwave emitters.
Not just yours, sir.
Microwave emitters of all other
networks have been destroyed too.
Uprooted the vendors' towers
they had rented as well.
Everyone is in a state of shock
You saw them, right?
What should I see?
My loss runs in millions.
If this continues, in 3 months
I'll be in the streets.
We are watching from all angles.
Not enough if you just watch.
We've paid through our nose for you
and your party during the election.
You should be standing out in the open
with your arms stretched like a tower.
Don't get tense.
This isn't your problem alone.
It concerns our national security.
Everybody is perplexed
and in a state of panic.
Yesterday in our cabinet meeting
we've requested military aid.
Even if you need a battalion
to guard each tower, we'll do it.
Don't worry.
Don't think you can appease me
like how you tackle the general public
I give you 1 week grace time.
By then things should
go back to normalcy
I must start my business again.
Otherwise the next upload in Wiki Leaks...
will be yours!
5th force.
The scientific world is still into
extensive research about this force.
The way it works
How to measure it.
Our knowledge is zilch.
This could be the 1st evidence
for the existence of the 5th force.
We can't explain this force based
on our knowledge of science.
Using the amenities at our disposal
we can't combat it either.
That's why we've requested
our military to step in.
Sir, it's a huge force
I saw it with my own eyes.
If you ask the military
to combat it
you will only face
enormous loss of life.
What should we do then?
To combat it effectively
we need a super power.
We need exceptional intelligence.
We need a man with
the boon of immortality.
A man who will never die?
Does a person like that exist?
Chitti.
The Robot!
We must reactivate him.
Dot...!
I'm waiting.
No... impossible.
It's against law, sir.
Our court has banned that robot.
Has been dismantled too.
It went out of control
and killed many lives.
Immense loss of property as well.
You are all well aware
if we bring it back
it won't die.
It will massacre all of us.
Everyone is aware who was responsible
for that robot's drastic change.
This time I'll ensure
such a blunder does not occur.
Sir, this is Mr Vaseegaran's conspiracy.
He wants to use this critical situation
and reactivate his invention.
He wants to make money by
selling it to multinational companies.
Now you decide.
Have we assembled here
to save the people?
Or for Vaseegaran's advertising?
Okay, so you come up with a solution.
Let's... think about it.
That's why we are here.
Sir, my suggestion is based
purely on good intentions.
This is the start
of an apocalypse.
If we don't prevent it now, we'll be wiped
out en masse, only Chitti can save us.
Mr Vaseegaran.
We can't flout a court order blatantly.
The process required
to do so is very tedious
I must pass an ordinance
in the Parliament.
Opposition parties should cooperate.
- Not possible.
- It is possible, sir.
A minister can easily take
some emergency decisions.
We can convince the court
by explaining in detail later.
Such a rule exists.
But if that robot kills some people?
Who will take the responsibility?
Should I?
Or our minister?
- Such a situation won't arise, sir.
- Why not?
That's a machine.
We can't predict
when it may screw up.
If it does something drastic
I'll be held responsible.
Let's forget Chitti.
Suggest some other option.
Military is the only other feasible option.
Let's go ahead with that.
Request and the order
will be released by today.
Do the needful.
Hello...?
So.
Plan collapsed?
Dhina, what is all this?
You are a scientist
You are well aware.
Of course.
But I won't let it happen
I'll never allow you to bring
that nitwit Chitti back to life.
What do you have against me?
You murdered my dad.
Me...?
That Chitti.
Your alter ego.
That is also you!
I'll never forget it.
'Yov! Lulla'
'I am the minister, I say'
'Your tower is back in its place
You saw it on the way, right?'
'All the phones are back in the city'
'You can go back
to your business, man'
Where are you speaking from?
'Right here'
I got drenched to the skin
No phone to even call Gopal.
Even I got stranded
near Taramani-
Nila, go up.
Hack it open, Nila.
Boss, according to my rules
hacking is illegal.
Isn't this wrong?
This will come under ethical hacking
Exception... do what I say
I understand, boss.
'If a handful of people benefit'
'...nothing is wrong', right?
Where did you get
this 'Nayagan' dialog from?
I should know all that humans like.
As per your adaptive learning
you've programmed in me.
Human beings have
only 4 preferences
TV, Cinema, food and gossip.
Easy!

"Is it an invitation of first love divine?"

Shut up!
'Leaving from airport
Battalion #121 proceeding to spot'
Entire state is under military control.
People need not panic.
Technology related to cell phone
networks in all the places
is being attended to
on a war-front emergency basis.
With military protection...
arrangements have been made
to restart sales of cell phones.
Very soon, people can start
using their cell phones as usual.
Hey, Balu - Sir...?
Call the minister and ask him
to provide us military protection.
We have 4 police vans
round the clock stationed here, sir.
If you look at the 303 rifles they have
even street dogs won't be scared.
We need AK 47, man.
You saw how Manoj Lulla whom we met
2 days ago was squeezed like juice, right?
I was the one who signed the order
to revive cell phone service in the city.
Looking at the current situation
looks like I'll be the next juice!
Call for the military immediately.
Juice for you, my dear.
- Is security in position?
- We've assigned 2 men, sir.
- Enough strength in front?
- Yes, sir.
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'
'Attack in Porur
Company on high alert'
SIR!
Sir...!
Aiya...!
What happened?
That cell phone gang uprooted
all the towers in Porur.
Wiped out our military force it seems, sir.
No one knows where
that horde has vanished now.
Yov! Porur is quite close to this place.
Double the protection
round our house.
A whole battalion is alert, sir.
Ask them to shut all gates,
doors and windows.
Not even the smallest hole
should be exposed.
Sir, everything has been closed
Including the computer's Windows!
They are throwing stones at us.
Sir, this isn't a stone
It's your cell phone.
Your missing cell phone
Come and see for yourself.
'True that!'
All the precious stones are intact.
How can you underestimate a minister?
Technology is in the palm of my hands!
That's why it has got scared
and returned only my mobile!
Who is this 'Unni Krishnan' calling?
It's an unknown ♪, sir
Good morning.
Yov! Call the military.
- Ask them to shoot this sparrow.
- Okay, sir.
Go... go... go.
Get out!
(WALKIE TALKIE RADIO CHATTER)
Sir, this way please.
- How is Mr Vairamoorthy?
- Critical, sir.
He's unable to breathe.
- Something is blocking his windpipe.
- What is it?
Don't know exactly, sir.
His secretary is equally dumbfounded
(GASPING FOR BREATH)
- Did you scan his body?
- We did, sir.
All the reports are normal.
But he is unable to breathe, sir.
- What happened, doctor?
- He is no more.
Whaat?!
Phone... phone.
All the phones flew away, sir.
Landline, man.
Hello, I am Home minister
Vijay Kumar speaking.
Activate that robot Chitti immediately.
Today.
Right now.
How can you ask as if you're ordering
'idli' and 'vada' as Take away?
It is a ban by the court, sir
I can't flout the rules of the court
I'll handle all those formalities
1st activate Chitti at once.
How is it possible immediately?
An ordinance has to be
passed in the Parliament.
'The Opposition has to cooperate'
The process is extremely complicated, sir
40 members of the Parliament
will favor us, sir
I'll handle all that.
It's a machine, sir.
We don't know when it will malfunction.
Who will shoulder the responsibility
if it kills someone? You or me?
Yov! Don't seek revenge
oblivious of time or situation.
It went into our Telecom minister's mouth.
God knows which part of me it will target
I'll take all the responsibility.
Satisfied?
Dot!
I came here at midnight
There was a queue right then
I haven't got the phone as yet
and she wants me to top up!
Without cell phones, our life is like
'A Few Pages Missing In The Middle'
Okay, what if the cell phones
fly away again?
I'm as sharp as a needle, you see.
Take a look.
You've fixed it like the chained tumbler
in the railway station!
Sir, for a while I was
so relaxed without cell phones.
No ringtones to bug me daily
I'm lifting my head to see the world
I talk to my children
I visit my friends face to face.
- Great feeling, eh?
- Then why the hell is he here?
What to do?
A cell phone is like one's wife.
Damn if she exists
Darn if she doesn't!
Become a habit!
Yes!
Chitti, you're back?
The way I fell I thought
my skull will blow to bits.
Thank you, Chitti.
Holy crow!
Chitti to Control.
- 'Control to Chitti'
- Assemble at TTK road junction.
What is this?
Integral space research centre.
That space research
centre isn't active now.
Research is no longer
conducted there.
Only 2 technicians are left.
In 1964, head of Atomic Commission
Dr Homi Baba inaugurated this centre.
Call Dr Sam.
Hello, Sam here.
Dr Sam, I'm Vasi
I need this information now, urgent.
What is that space research centre
in sector II Phase XIV?
Vasi, keep this confidential.
To find out if life exists
in other planets just like us on earth
signals are sent from many parts
of the world to outer space.
That is one such place
from where signals are sent.
What kind of signals are being sent?
There are good forces and bad forces
co existing in this world.
We send only positive signals
to outer space.
Because only positive energy
present in space
should be aware
of our presence here.
Thank you very much, Sam.
Chitti, play that visual
in Kirlian mode.
Look at that.
If that cell phone bird is scared
of the positive signals from the emitters
there is some negative force
embedded in it.
By negative force
you mean from another planet?
Freeze it.
No, this is some negative force
present only on our earth.
This is a human face.
It looks very familiar to me.
Nila, I want all the recent
abnormal events in Thirukazhukundram.
Most importantly
details of the deceased a.s.a.p.
Doctor, this resembles the emitter
we saw in that space research centre.
Exactly - What is your plan?
You know by now You tell me.
If it is a human negative energy
that is creating the 'mobile' force
it has no physical form.
But only the aura
that surrounds the human body.
Aura...?
Atoms in a human body
consist of neutrons and electrons.
The micro photon particles
that emanate from it is called aura.
It is a thin layer around the body
not visible to the human eye.
Aura of a person who is alive
is charged positive.
A dead person's aura
will be charged negative.
We must destroy that negative charge.
The only way to succeed is to send
a more powerful positive charge towards it.
And neutralize its energy.
Aura of a deceased person
is micro photon minus.
We must send micro photon plus.
Add plus to minus
it becomes zero.
- Am I right, doctor?
- Exactly, Chitti.
This photon synthesizer
generates micro photon plus.
See
I've created the same positive rays here
similar to the Research centre.
This is 10 times stronger than
any negative energy known to mankind.
We can neutralize
the negative energy for sure.
Wow! Great.
Boss, here are the details you asked for
73 people died last year
in Thirukazhukundram.
Only 18 unnatural death
2 murders 4 suicides.
Is any death connected to a cell phone?
A lorry driver died in an accident
using his mobile while driving.
Because her 'hot' photos
went viral through her mobile
a girl consumed poison.
One man died hanging himself
in a cell phone tower.
- Date?
- April 7th.
The next day cell phones started vanishing.
Oh my God!
Now I'm getting a clearer picture.
Chitti, immediately
install this in AIRD bus.
We are leaving for Thirukazhukundram.
Doctor, we got it
I found all the phones.
Nila, bring the bus
to the rear end of the house.
CHITTI!
Nila, fix the cryostat, quick!
My God!
Pakshi Raja...!
Nice DP.
This is a war between
the entire mankind and me.
You are not a human being.
Don't interfere.
- Run away.
- Running away isn't in my software at all
I have been reactivated
only to protect human beings.
My primary task is to destroy you!
Pakshi Raja, why are you
so furious with the human race?
Why are you behaving like this?
What do you need?
This is a pied cuckoo.
Biological name is Jacobin cuckoo.
In Northern India...
the monsoon season starts
only when this species migrates.
If this species doesn't show up...
there will be no rainfall
in that year for the entire region.
Till date no one knows
the mystery behind this.
Even in our mythology
it is referred as 'rain bird'
Carry out research on this.
Sure, sir.
Wow...!
Sir, your photo is
on the cover page.
It was published a year ago.
Sir, how did you get
interested in birds?
Actually the other way about
The birds evinced interest in me!

and going around the fan in a circle'
"To the sun's ray at dawn that glitter
a warm welcome your wings you flutter."
"As the sun slides down yonder deep
you caress the branches to sleep."
"With your pitter patter dainty feet
'kolam' you draw as an aesthetic treat."
"Today you make me yearn
To fly like you I want to learn."
"Flock of birds in flight"
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping"
'I decided right then'
'My life will be dedicated
to birds and only birds'
"Flock of birds in flight."
"Oho! A flight of birds in sight."
"I stood listening
to your musical chirping."
"A host of sparrows
A flight of swallows"
"I wish to hear
your tweet and twitter."
"No language or religion, you fly at ease
Any place is your home, as you please."
"No language, no religion, you roam
You affirm any place is your home."
"You claim even weeds to be
your kith and kin in reality."
"You form a swing in mid-air
to play with the wind out there."
"You make a deep impact in people
to whom laughter isn't easy or simple."
"My precious life, my cherished creed
A heart like yours is needed indeed."
"Even if the world is wiped out extensively
an urge to protect you surges effusively."
"Swiftly on a flying spree
in the skies carefree."
"Fly without any boundary."
That's why I studied
ornithology with passion
I became an ornithology professor too.
'Pon ulagaaleero'
'Bhuvanam muzhudhaleero'
'Nannaya pullinangaal'
These are lines from
Nammazhwar's Thiruvaimozhi.
This is the meaning.
O' birds, you are all over this world.
You have spread your wings
right up to Heaven.
Our earth and our skies
abound in these birds.
When compared to the weight
of the human race on earth...
weight of the birds en masse
is almost 100 times more.
Birds eat 1000 times more food
than what humans consume.
If they didn't feed on worms
not even 1 green leaf
will be left on earth.
Human beings won't
get any food at all.
Because insects are
1000 times more than birds!
So if human beings have to
survive on this earth...
birds also should be alive.
Sir, of late birds flocking to
the bird sanctuary in Vedanthangal
has dwindled
What is the reason, sir?
When I was young, we used to wake up
only to the chirp of sparrows.
'You don't get to see any sparrow
in the city nowadays, sir'
'Only in 1996...'
'...cell phones were
introduced in India'
'In a gradual and continuous process
birds have decreased only after this'
'Particularly sparrows'
It is called Arctic Tern.
This small bird weighing just 50 gm
migrates every year
from the Arctic region
flying 12000 km
to our Vedanthangal
and returns.
A bird doesn't have a map or radar.
From within its head, it absorbs
all micro rays from the sky.
And using cryptochrome formation
it steers in the right direction.
'That is the bird's sole strength'
Now we've filled the sky with radiation
from numerous cell phone towers.
So the cryptochrome formation
in the bird's head is shattered.
And eliminated completely.
'Not knowing where they are heading'
'...birds lose their way and
their entire species is becoming extinct'
'To the birds, it is equal
to losing their sanity'
In addition, because of the radiation...
shells aren't being formed
on the eggs of these birds.
Their eggs resemble a layer of skin.
The eggs break when
the mother bird is incubating.
In reality, men also suffer
from these repercussions.
Many get afflicted by ♪♪♪♪♪♪

Mr Pakshi Rajan.
What is your solution?
Why do we use cell phone now?
Just gossip and trivialities.
Let's control that.
Why do we need so many
cell phones and towers?
Let us reduce that.
Let us pass a law as to who, why and
for how long a cell phone can be used.
Has this chap lost it?
Is he mad?
Instead of the current high frequency
cell phone technology
let us invent
a safer technology.
Until then let us shut down
90% of the cell phone towers in India.
Please speak a little loudly.
Sir, please excuse me.

When the sun rises, they swing placards
defending dogs, cats, crows and sparrows.
Can't you chase them?
'Refusing to leave, sir
Very insistent about meeting you'
Tell me.
What's your problem?
What is the frequency rate
permitted by TRAI?
What is the frequency rate
in your towers at present?
Birds flying in the sky are being
destroyed in their fetus stage by you.
Hello mister, listen.
We strictly follow the rules of
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.
Already subscribers complain.
'No signal in the bathroom or basement
Skype doesn't work in the lift'
Do you know in these 3 months
2000 customers have...
switched to other networks?
Don't lie.
In your disgusting competition
just to retain your subscribers
you are increasing the frequency rate
to suit your needs as you wish.
Now it is well over the danger limit.
Because of the heavy radiation
the entire species of birds
the bird kingdom is dying
without a trace.
You aren't one bit bothered.
You are exaggerating.
Birds becoming extinct
due to cell phone radiation
has no scientific proof or backing.
You know that?
If that is so come with me.
Stand under your cell phone tower
for just 24 hours
I will prove it!
You get out.
You asked for scientific proof, right?
I'll provide it.
Get out, man.
Write to the Press & Media.
Hold placards and
protest in the hot sun
I don't care.
Out.
Get out!
Nonsense!
Move it a little bit upwards.
Hey... listen!
What is this, sir?
Stop it
I'm telling you.
There are houses nearby
Many birds flock around.
Stop everything - Hey, old man.
Are we building a nuclear plant here?
It's only a cell phone tower.
Hereafter you'll get good signal
on your phone, move aside.
Come on... come.
- What is it, sir?
- Ramasamy
I repeatedly told you
about birds dying.
You were also worried.
- But now...?
- What can I do, sir?
Agriculture is no longer profitable.
Insects kill all my yield
I became a pauper
buying insecticides.
Primary reason for that is
the increased death rate of birds.
Only birds eat insects.
If birds die...
insects will increase
beyond control.
Whatever the reason, I don't
have the strength to be a farmer.
This is the only income
I can get from this land.
Why should you sell your land
to a man who kills birds?
People are dying
of starvation here.
And you're bothered
about birds dying!
Don't pester me
Attend to your work.
Move aside.
'Ladies and gentlemen'
'Stop using cell phone'
Every cell phone used is encased
with the blood of thousands of birds.
Each cell phone is a sparrow's coffin!
Save birds.
Come here - Yes, sir.
Who is this man?
Disturbing all our customers.
Chase him away - Okay, sir.
What happened?
Ladies and gentlemen.
Don't use cell phones.
Here... read this.
Aiyaiyo!
I have given many petitions
in many levels many times.
'No one has taken any action'
Oh!
Is this why we don't see
any sparrows at all?
When I was a kid
they used to flock around my house.
It was a feast for sore eyes
I've played with those birds.
When I grew up, I have
even fried and feasted on them.
A real treat for the taste buds.
- Crispy, like quail fry.
- Super, sir.
And that concoction made with it.
What an aphrodisiac!
It isn't available nowadays.
What is this?
I'm talking of ensuring birds live
and you're relishing killing them.
What else do you want me to do?
Shall we start a Sparrow Welfare Board?
You can be elected as the chairman
1st take strict action against networks
which exceed their allotted frequency.
Cancel their license.
Then?
Grant permission only 2 networks
following regulations to the T.
What are you saying?
We boast of a population of 1.3 billion.
Shouldn't we reach all of them?
Shouldn't every area receive signal?
Cell phone is the
foundation for everything.
The world will come to a standstill
if mobiles don't work for an hour.
How much time is saved
because of this gadget?
Business has developed
Industries have prospered.
Because he's hungry will anyone
chop his own hand and eat it?
Same holds good for the progress
we attain by killing birds.
If a 30 gm sparrow can't live
depending on us
…then how can we boast of
this technology and progress?
America is a bigger nation than India.
It has only 4-5 networks
China is the most populated
country in the world.
Only 3 networks are used.
But here?
More than 10.
You accept ♪♪♪♪♪♪ from everyone
And allow networks to flourish
flouting all the rules.
You're letting your tongue run, eh?
You seem educated
I was lenient because you're a big shot
You're analysing politics, huh?
Okay, let me counteract.
We work based only
on rules and regulations.
Only by adhering to international rules
cell phone service is allotted.
File a case in court
if you have any doubts.
Clear out now.
Don't get angry
Please listen to me
I was patient for so long, eh?
Go... go to court.
You'll get a verdict after many years.
Prime minister says
I must meet the common man.
'And I get caught
with such crackpots'
Court officials are coming
to check radiation frequency.
Make sure it is well within the limit.
'From multiples tests conducted
it has been found...'
'...only adequate radiation
has been channelized into cell phones'
'It has not been proved scientifically
that birds are affected by cell phones'
'Therefore Pakshi Rajan's case
has been adjourned'
Pakshi Rajan, whatever you say
is just and right.
But killing humans is wrong.
They killed countless flocks of birds
Isn't that a crime?
You'll label human life differently.
In what way are birds' lives inferior?
Why do you kill innocent people
for the fault of a handful of men?
Who is 'innocent'?
Every individual who owns
a cell phone is a murderer.
How I yelled my throat hoarse.
How many streets
I would've walked begging.
How many feet I fell
pleading not to use cell phones.
Did even a single soul
pay heed to my pleas?
They read about this in newspapers.
Watch the News on TV.
And then...
exclaim 'oh'!
Do sparrows die only due to
radiation from cell phones?
'How sad!'
'Poor things, no?'
Just for 5 minutes
make clucking sounds.
Share that article and video clipping
in WhatsApp and Facebook.
Thinking their duty is over and
it was their good deed for the day.
They go back to
their cell phones, blockheads!
I won't let this go.
I won't spare even a single person
who owns a cell phone.
Hereafter.
Cell phone is everyone's Yama!
Just watch, people should panic and
run for their lives as soon as they see it.
Pakshi, you've reached your stop.
Get into the bus.
Chitti!
Oh my God!
Thanks - Welcome.
Hey! What is this?
You've fixed your MPU in me.
Oh! By mistake
I was wondering why
my core memory was corrupt.
Punch dialogs Vadivelu comedy.
'Vani Rani' episodes
Banana flower fritters!
#star-darling and dance-king
All kinds of stuff.
Come, lie down I will fix it.
No need.
Let it be.
Aura.
Every human, beast,
inanimate object.
Even every place has an aura.
This aura invisible to the eye pertains
not only to spirituality but science too.
With the help of a Kirlian camera
we can take photos of an aura.
Ordinary people have an aura
3 to 4 feet thick.
Some sages have an aura
spreading over 50 feet
Russian scientist
Dr Frank Baranowski has proved this.
Pakshi Rajan's aura is enormous.
It isn't the aura of
an individual man alone.
Aura of 1000s of birds
which were destroyed.
A giant ball of negative energy.
With a mind.
A very angry mind.
This maybe a form of 5th force.
It has controlled all the cell phones.
It would've destroyed
our city given a chance.
We succeeded only because
of Chitti's reappearance.
Thank you, Chitti.
I thank all of you
who have been a source of support.
In our ancient classics
we have heard many stories of God
descending on earth to destroy demons.
Lord Shiva Himself came as a robot
to save us from a fate worse than death
I invite that Iron warrior Chitti
on to the dais to share a few words.
When a warrior fights
his shadow battles along with him.
When the warrior pierces and kills
the enemy, the shadow will follow suit.
So will we praise and
garland the shadow?
He is real
I am his shadow.
All glory and praise to
that God who created me.
Thank you.
At this juncture I must thank
and mention a specific name.
At the right moment
parting with the heart
I mean, giving the MPU
if I had not been activated
I couldn't have destroyed the evil force.
The name is...
Nila.
At this wonderful moment
a piece of good news for you.
Chitti who has been created
by Dr Vaseegaran
has been approved by our Govt.
An order has been passed this morning
to create 500 Chitti robots
for our Indian army.
Thank you.
Hi, scientist.
May I come in?
Irresponsible people.
Trash your cell phones.
This is your last chance.
Otherwise...
death is certain!
I'm not the Mahesh
who got tagged in #MeToo, dear!
Check your phone properly
Why don't you-
Didn't you hear what I said?
I always wear Victoria Secret, you know.
Including the latest one-
- Nila, is photon synthesizer set?
- Yes.
'Hey! Pub closes at midnight'
'Let's go tomorrow'
'Hey! Stop... stop'
Doctor, what happened to you?
Why are you behaving like this?
Welcome, my dear 'nuts & bolt toy'
I'm not your doctor!
Nila, turn on the neutralizer.
No...!
Nila, stop it!
You can't do anything to me, Chitti.
I have a body now.
Dr Vaseegaran's body!
If you destroy me...
it is the same as
you killing your God!
Now...
can you turn it on please?
Show off your technology.
Turn it on.
Switch it on, damn you!
Chitti...!
Don't hesitate Turn it on.
Destroy me.
He'll be destroyed along with me.
No, doctor I can't do that.
Chitti, thinking you are saving me
don't exterminate the entire human race.
Kill me.
Destroy him.
Kill me - Sorry, doctor.
Human emotion fed by you
is stopping me.
Moron! This is my order, kill me.
No, hold fire.
If you shoot, only Vaseegaran
will die unnecessarily.
Can't kill Pakshi Rajan.
Chitti, why are you stopping them?
Let them shoot me - No.
Chitti.
Aiyo! Chitti.
Nila, turn on the neutralizer.
'Come on, quick!'
Nila... NO!
'Don't do that'
Shut up! This is my order.
Switch it on.
Aiyo!
What you've done
is really foolish, Chitti.
Your 'call' is disconnected!
Chitti...?
What a pity!
Chitti... Chitti.
Chit-
Chitti.
Nila, go right now and-
"Earth shattering cyclone blows
today right now."
"He's gonna break, break, break
Break it down!"
"Pakshi Raja gonna destroy everyone."
"As quick as a stride
destruction of a different kind."
"Illusionary tricks galore
Danger! Caution all the more."
"He's going to eat you alive."
"Run for your life"
"I am a bird of prey waiting to eat you
Feather-man who got into you head to toe."
"Pakshi Raja!"
"King of birds... Pakshi Raja"
"I have the souls of birds many
to seek revenge, flocking within me."
"King of birds... Pakshi Raja."
Unique feeling of real joy
to die and get reactivated!
Pakshi.
Unlike your name
you can't fly any longer!
Hey, Nila...!
Why are you standing right there?
True to your name,
Nila should orbit the earth, eh?
Come... come... come.
Come on, baby.
Wow...!
Only 2 tasks of Vaseegaran
in his research are worthy of praise.
One is me.
The other is you!
What are you looking at?
Come on.
Give a beautiful kiss
to your great king, baby.
Stop the play, Chitti.
We must 1st destroy Pakshi.
Because he is even more powerful than you.
He's committing atrocities multi-fold.
He was able to shred
even you into million parts.
Now...
he's number 1 here.
Not you.
Hey, this #1 and #2
are all child's play
I am the only one.
Super one!
No comparison, understand?
I understand, Chitti.
We must make him understand.
You bet I will.
The king of birds.
The battle is on!

Right.

You are going to be
not reachable from now.
'Because...'
all of you will die now.
'By no means an ordinary death'
'Radiation death!'
You will all die in groups
like how the sparrows collapsed.
'Don't you get it?'
I'll combine the radiation

I'll download it on all of you.

How...?
I was the one who released you.
At least for that reason
let me go please.
So what?
You are a subscriber too, man.
Don't hurt me please.
"He's going to eat you alive"
"I am a bird of prey waiting to eat you
Feather-man who got into you head to toe."
"Pakshi Raja."
You will meet your end in this way,
a fate worse than ordinary death.
"Pakshi Raja."

Dear subscribers!
Dear subscribers.
Don't panic.
You are not the ones
who are about to die.
A small bird.
What are you looking at Pakshi?
I am Chitti.
Reloaded.
Version 2.0!
Doctor, is that you?
Did I shoot you?
Did I try to kill you?
My God! I was about
to commit a grave sin.
Doctor, please don't harm me.
You are my creator.
Don't rip me apart with your own hands.
Forgive me and let me go.
Please.
Fat hopes!
Vasi...!
Come, you selfie bots!
I will set your screens on fire.
"I bow down to like, no man
I bow down, I say, 'no damn'"

"There is no comparison
'cos I am Super Super one"
"I'm out to get you
Let ya wreck ya self."
"See me coming out"
"10000 fighters by my side
I'm about to shoot 'em down."
"I'm the only one you see."
Zero balance!
Shoot that sparrow.
Hey bird man!
Iron man!
I'm just a driver Let me go.
Pakshi!
You had better scatter
and scoot from here.
Otherwise I'll pluck
every single feather out.
You moron of a machine!
Why are you fighting
for these ungrateful men?
When you've served their purpose
they will rip your nuts apart!
Hey! What's happening?
Yayayay... angry bird!
Why are you staring?
I am Kutti!
The microbot.
Version 3.O.
If you disturb my boss
your dove will be.
Dodo!
"I am Isaac Asimov's grandson, buddy"
"I am a warrior, size of a turkey berry."
"O bird of prey
You're a goner, I say."
"It's 'Festival of lights' for us today."
It is said a bird can look
in 6 different directions.
Pakshi, won't you see?
Microbots.
No... no.
Hey! Don't do this.
Maintain that same panic.
"Birdie got caught-o?"
Bow bow.
"Feathers fell apart-o?"
"3.O"
"Swarmed all over you?"
Pakshi, if you breach this stadium
with your radiation
1st victims will be
only your birds!'
Microbots, go
"3.O"
"3.O"
"I am a cannon 6" tall
You're a radish, that's all"
"I am an automated masterpiece

"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me."
A lion can't touch a mosquito, big birdie!
But if mosquitoes set their minds
they can chase the lion to its doom.
Cuckoo!
Good job, 3.O.
Thank you, commander.
- Microbots positioned?
- All set.
Pakshi.
Have a blast!
Should these doves also explode?
Hey beep Follow me.
Come on, bots.
"O eagle, you're a goner, I say."
"It's 'Conquest of good over evil' today."
"Bird of prey It's a jolly day."
"You are a guest in hell any which way."

"If I burst, it will be a wrecker
like a boom-boom cracker."
Hey! Who are you?
What are you doing here?
This is restricted area.
Get out!
You are the reason
we are alive today, Vaseegaran.
What an enormous risk you've taken
and saved all of us!
Technology saved us.
But we are the ones
misusing technology.
We should eliminate poverty
with the help of technology.
Eradicate diseases.
Promote education.
If we use it for personal comforts and
fuelling our greed, it's only doomsday.
Will... will that Pakshi Rajan reappear?
He is dead and gone.
But if we continue this way
another 'evil force' will erupt.
Even if Pakshi Rajan's actions were wrong
there was truth in his words.
If human beings should live on earth
birds should also co exist.
Control radiation.
Reduce networks.
Pass a rule, no technology should affect
any living thing, human, bird or beast.
This earth doesn't belong only to us.
Everyone should realize it belongs
to all the living creatures here.
You are right.
Ensure birds are not destroyed.
At least provide water for birds
to drink during our scorching summers.
That's enough to refresh
and revitalize your minds.
All this will happen, Vaseegaran
I'll bring this to the notice
of our Parliament
I'll make sure this happens.
Thank you, Vaseegaran.
Thanks, Nila.
Why are you thanking your shadow?
Oh God!
We have to remove
that red chip from Chitti.
Don't worry, boss.
To be on the safe side I activated it
after doing an auto-eject program.
Smaaart!
Good to see you alright, doctor.
Me too, Chitti.
Doctor, all the robots and I have to report
in the headquarters at Delhi today.
Can I leave, doctor?
Take Nila with you
subtitled by rekhs
assisted by harini & pradeep.
Doctor, how can I leave you like this and-
I can take care of myself.

"Itsy-bitsy, I'm snuff powder heady
I'm into your nostril, deal with me"
