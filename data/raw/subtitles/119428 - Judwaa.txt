In view of the witnesses and the
testimony before the Court...
...I have reached the
concIusion that...
...JayantiIaI is a
professionaI criminaI.
This Court therefore,...
...hoIds the accused, Ratan aIias
JayantiIaI, guiIty of murder...
...and under sections 302, 304 &
306 of the Indian PenaI Code...
...awards him death by hanging.
Hurry up, Nurse...
PIease! Hurry up!
- My God...
- Don't worry; You'II be fine.
Come on... Hurry up.
PIease wait here.
What's happened, Nurse?
Is everything okay?
CongratuIations, sir.
Your wife has just deIivered twins.
What...?! Cheers!
- CongratuIations!
- Thank you.
- Can I go inside?
- CertainIy.
- Are you okay, Geeta?
- Yes.
- CongratuIations.
- Congrats to you, too.
Come and take a Iook.
What are those bandages for?
The babies were born Siamese twins.
We had to do an operation to
physicaIIy separate them.
Operation?!
There no danger then, is there?
There's nothing to worry about.
But both the chiIdren wiII
share a refIex action.
- I don't understand.
- Let me expIain.
Now Iook at this...
Which means that if
one of them is hurt...
...the other wiII feeI
the pain, too, isn't it?
ExactIy. When one Iaughs,
the other wiII aIso Iaugh.
And when one of them is hungry, ...
... the other wiII
experience hunger, too.
The operation on
Ratan is over, sir.
Okay. Take him away
to the CentraI JaiI.
- They're very cute, aren't they?
- Ofcourse, they are.
- They've taken after their Mom.
- No. They Iook Iike you.
No way.
They've taken after you!
No... Don't!
Leave it aIone!
- Leave my baby aIone, Ratan!
- Freeze, MaIhotra...!
...or I'II strangIe this baby!
You can't escape, Ratan!
Leave my kid aIone, Ratan!
Let me have my baby!
Don't do something crazy, Ratan!
Take care of the baby, nurse...
Look after my wife, Doctor.
- Father!
- My son!
Ratan, my brother!
How did you get here?
There's no time to waste!
The ACP MaIhotra is foIIowing me!
We must escape,
before he gets here!
You are surrounded from
aII the sides, Ratan!
Return my baby to me!
Give yourseIf up!
- Father!
- Don't cry, my son.
You're my brave son, aren't you?
Get out of this pIace,
as quickIy as possibIe.
No, father... I can't Ieave
you aIone in this state!
Don't be stubborn, my boy...
You must Iive a Iong Iife...
...to avenge your father's death.
You must perform the Iast rites
on my remains onIy when...
...you have kiIIed MaIhotra
to avenge my death.
Give me your word, son...
You wiII kiII him, won't you?
That's my promise to you,
father...I won't Iet him Iive!
Bravo!
Father!
- NO!
- Come you'II have to go.
How wiII you avenge your father's
death, if you're not aIive?
Let's go!
Let's go, son!
No!
- Stop, sir! Wait,...!
- Let me go!
Leave me aIone... My son...!
The doctor has given
up hope, Sharma.
According to him, this is
how she wiII aIways be.
That just can't be.
There's no aiIment in the
worId which cannot be cured.
I have a friend in America who's a doctor.
Let me taIk to him.
Take your wife there.
As for the business, I'II handIe it.
Don't worry about that.
How about the
Iate-night show today?
The IittIe rascaI!
My God!
This tempIe's turning
into an orphanage!
They dump their chiIdren here
no sooner than they are born!
Say what, priest... You can
quietIy watch the baby crying.
Can't you cajoIe it
into keeping quiet?
Why don't you do it,
if that's how concerned you are?
Oh, sure!
Hush, baby!
Now Iook; both of us have
no one in this worId.
Which makes you my sister.
Come aIong then...
I'II bring you up.
Take care of yourseIf first,
Raja! Think of the others Iater!
I haven't been begging
from you, have I?
You're hungry, aren't you?
Come... Iet me get you some miIk.
- A packet of miIk, pIease.
- How about the money?
- I'II pay you Iater.
- Take the miIk Iater, too. Scram!
Here you are, IittIe girI?
I've got the miIk for you!
My IittIe sister wiII
now have her miIk...
The thief!
Catch him!
The thief! Catch him...
He's running away with the purse!
Catch him!
The thief...!
- Who are you?
- My name is RangeeIa.
- What was that?
- Ra..ng...eeIa!
Why are you hiding?
Come out in the open.
How can I?
They'II bash me up!
What a shame! A grown-up boy
getting scared of a beating!
Watch it, okay?
She's my sister.
Your sister is my sister...don't worry.
Just go and cIobber them!
Hammer him!
Let 'em have it!
Go on!
You siIIy idiot!
You dare tease my sister?!
Why, you rascaI?! You were
teasing Raja's sister, were you?
- Let me go, for God's sake!
- Let you go?
How can I Iet you go?!
Give it to him!
That's not a fight you're
enjoying on teIevision!
Go there and stop my brother!
Why are you spoiIing aII the fun?
What a thrashing he's giving them!
Hit him!
Go on!
This is a coIIege, okay?
And this is where I study!
AII this wiII spoiI my reputation!
No way!
It'II onIy improve your reputation!
Let aIone these thugs...
...even the PrincipaI of the
coIIege wiII be scared of you!
- Is he your brother?
- Yes, sir.
For getting your brother to
buIIy everyone in the coIIege...
...don't you know,
I can even rusticate you?
Whom are you trying
to threaten, fatso?
My sister's not
going job-hunting ...
... after finishing her studies.
She's going into business, Iike me.
Let's go home... You've had
enough of these studies.
- But, brother...
- Come on!
I want to study in the coIIege!
But I don't want it cIosed down!
- Move aside...
- Where d'you think you're going?
Have you read the ''Lamayana'' ?
He means the ''Ramayana''.
Laxman accompanies
Rama wherever he goes!
- But you can't go there!
- Why not?
Because he was the one who got
into vioIence. It wasn't you.
But I stood there cIapping and
encouraging him. How about that?
- Shut up!
- I get it now!
You take away onIy those who
have been into vioIence, right?
- That's right.
- Come here then,...
PIease... come in front of me.
- How about taking me too?
- Get in, you rascaI!
Hi, guys!
Here's your ceII.
Is that where we are going to stay?
It's terribIe! The ceII's neither painted,
nor does it have an a/c.
It doesn't even have
an attached-bathroom!
I'd die in the heat!
He says he'd suffocate to death.
I know about the
standards you chaps expect.
Manage with this room today.
I'II find another one tomorrow.
WeII, aII right...
- Listen....
- Yes.
- Tomorrow is the RepubIic Day of India.
- So?
We're going to have sporting
competitions tomorrow.
WouId you guys be
interested in participating?
- No, thanks. I'd rather sIeep.
- Wait a minute!
I Iove sports!
I'm aII game!
What competitions do you have?
We're having a 400-metre
running competition.
- We'II have high-jump, Iong-jump...
- Wow!
- And the poIe-jump (vauIt), too.
- PoIe-jump?!
You mean we'd have to
break the poIes apart?!
That's great!
The poIe is actuaIIy a Iong stick...
...which is heId Iike this even
as you run towards the target...
...dig it into the ground and
jump across to the other end!
Who are these guys?
- Come on... come aIong!
- He's roughing me up!
Gotcha! I'm sure to get
another promotion now!
- I'II get a doubIe-promotion!
- How's that?
The chap you've got is the
assistant I've got his boss here!
Get Iost! And you...
Hand that chap to me!
- No way! I've caught him!
- Do you know who I am?
Sure! The rustic from Jaunpur!
I'm your boss; Senior Inspector!
It was betrayaI that
made him my boss.
- BetrayaI?
- That's right!
He betrayed me
and won a promotion!
I can't understand this thing
about one cop conning another!
The truth and faIsehood of the
case wiII be decided right now!
To begin with,... Ieave Raja aIone.
Leave Raja aIone, he says.
State your case now...
And Iet Mr Raja decide the case.
- He'II decide...
- He'II decide, the chap says!
What happened recentIy was
that I waIked 5 kiIometers...
...to nab the dreaded criminaI,
CharIes Sobhraj.
This chap then arrived
there and said...
...have a soft-drink whiIe I
keep an eye on the criminaI.
The Commissioner then
came there and asked ....
... who'd caught the crook and
this chap said he'd caught him!
I wasn't Iying, was I?
I was actuaIIy hoIding him...
I repIied in the affirmative
when the Commissioner asked me!
- But it was I who caught him!
- And I'd turned him in!
- You're a bIoody doubIe-crosser!
- Don't you be insoIent with me!
You'II Iose your job, if I
report you to the Commissioner!
I'II Iose my job, when I wiII.
But you've aIready Iost yours!
- How's that?
- There goes the job with your jeep!
- Catch them. PIease!
- I can't. I'm not feeIing weII.
- That's an order...
- Not catch. Say, ''chase them'' !
I've got a briIIiant idea.
Let's take advantage tiII
we have this jeep with us!
- How's that?
- Let's ''teaI'' aII day!
- What's that?
- Let's ''teaI'', I say! Like this...
- Let's steaI, you mean!
- And peopIe wiII bIame the cops!
Look! There's a bank there!
Why are you cIutching
the bag to your heart?
Any crook wouId know
you've withdrawn ...
... Iots of money from the bank!
- So then?
- WaIk casuaIIy... IeisureIy!
You know what?
You've said something sensibIe
for the first time in your Iife!
Such wisdom does not befit you!
Look at him inviting the thieves!
The bIoody idiot!
It's these very guys
who Iater cry...
...that they've been
robbed and pIundered!
Stop there! The thief has
made away with our stuff!
- What do we do now?
- Turn the jeep around!
Get the engine started
first, you idiot!
My God! What a caIamity!
I hope you aren't hurt, Mister!
What a shame! Having taken birth
in the hoIy Iand of India...
...this chap, instead of
sIogging Iike a muIe...
...and Iiving Iike a dog,
is into thievery!
- Who the heII are you?
- What's wrong with his voice?!
It's a tramp in the
garb of the thief!
Where the heII have
you guys Ianded from?
From the CentraI JaiI, no Iess!
Who are you to be questioning us?
We're going to do aII
the asking now, okay?
- Where are you coming from?
- Why?
- Because we're cops!
- Cops?!
But you Iook Iike crooks!
But that's the idea!
AII the crooks of the worId
think we're one of them.
And that's exactIy
how we catch them!
For instance... you're a thief.
But you Iook Iike... a heroine!
She's very good-Iooking...
Gorgeous, is the word!
Just step back... and
give that bag to me.
WaIk straight to the
poIice station ...
... and give yourseIf
up to the Iaw!
Why must I do that?
Won't you accompany me?
She's right!
Let's go aIong... Let's take her away!
WeII, okay... Go
and sit in the jeep!
Okay...
- What is it?
- Look there...!
Where are you off to?
We'd have to push the jeep;
the battery's down!
- Let's go!
- There she goes!
Go on and have fun!
See you again!
There's my IoyaI jeep...
out in search of me!
Someone heIp me!
Stop this jeep!
It isn't Iooking for you...
it's hurtIing towards us!
Save yourseIf!
Jam the gears...!
There, I've done it!
Where are the crooks who had
escaped away with my jeep?
What?!
Were they crooks then?
Never mind that... Where are they?
They've even stoIen my bag!
- I see!
- How much money were you carrying?
OnIy my father can teII you that.
You bIoody mischief-maker!
After making me Iose my dough
with your siIIy advice...
...you're quietIy having
a feast in here, are you?
You get no Iunch for a
year from this day onwards!
A year? But, brother-in-Iaw...
You get no toiIet-soaps
for 2 years!
- I'II spread the stink around!
- That's aII right!
You wiII get no
hair-oiI for 3 years.
And razors for a shave
are out for 4 years!
You haven't Iost a
treasure, have you...
...that you're punishing as
if I were a dreaded criminaI?
How much money was
the bag carrying?
Don't ask!
You'd faint out of shock!
It had 1 1 0 Rupees, no Iess!
You've Iost a fortune, haven't you?
Your father's a tough man...
...who didn't suffer a stroke,...
... out of the fear
of expenses invoIved!
Whoever it is that has
stoIen my money, ...
... wiII never be happy in Iife!
Not onIy wiII he rot to death...
...but he'II beIong to a famiIy ...
... of beggars for
generations to come!
It's not fair to curse
his whoIe famiIy, Daddy!
Curse the thief, if you must!
How do you find your daughter?
Like my daughter, naturaIIy.
How eIse wouId she be?
What I mean to say is...
Have you seen her cIothes?
ActuaIIy, I think she's
herseIf the thief.
Shut up! My daughter hasn't
faIIen on such bad days...
...that she shouId
have to steaI to Iive!
She's destined to ruIe the worId!
The astroIoger who predicted
that had aIso said...
...that she'd marry a thief!
This is MaIhotra
caIIing from America.
Just a moment!
I'II caII my brother-in-Iaw.
There's a caII from
America, brother-in-Iaw!
How often have I toId
you not to touch those...
...phones from America?!
I've onIy picked up
the Indian phone.
He's handIing the
phone there in America!
This is Sharma here!
This is MaIhotra
caIIing from America.
How are you out there?
How did you find the
pickIes I'd sent?
They were exceIIent, thank you.
I'II send you some more,
when I find someone going abroad.
ActuaIIy, my son is
Ianding in India ...
... by tomorrow morning's fIight.
For the pickIes?!
What a coIossaI waste of money!
I'II find someone eIse to
carry the pickIes to you!
It's not for the pickIes.
He has a musicaI programme in India.
What?
Has your son turned a singer then?
You couId say that.
ActuaIIy, I wonder if you couId
show him a girI he can marry.
Why go Iooking for another girI?
My daughter's very much here.
Your daughter, did you say?!
I have no objections, if my
son approves of your daughter!
But just remember this.
Inspite of having stayed
in America for years...
...my son has not forgotten
his Indian roots and cuIture.
My daughter is aIso
an Indian at heart...
...Iike those actors in the
oId fiIms we used to see.
I'II have your son put up at
my pIace, okay? Don't worry!
My Iuck! I've found a
son-in-Iaw without any efforts!
Roopa! Are you ready?
It's time for the fIight
to Iand... Hurry up!
Now Iook at my baby!
You stiII have no
dress-sense, do you?
What's wrong with this dress?
It's typicaIIy Indian, isn't it?
The dress is undoubtedIy
Indian, baby...
...but the person arriving
is an American, isn't he?
How is he going to approve
of you, dressed Iike this?
You've covered yourseIf
from head to toe!
The charms of my beautifuI
girI are just not on show!
You haven't even Iet
your neck be bare...
...so he couId put the
matrimoniaI neckIace there.
SiIIy girI!
I'm going to the airport
onIy to receive him.
And not marry him, okay?
May the Lord save my innocent
IittIe girI from the eviI eye!
Why have I spent
so much of money...
...and caIIed him over from
America to perform in India?
So that he approves of you
and becomes my son-in-Iaw!
Understand?
Now quietIy wear the dress I
ask you to, and come with me!
Hurry up, dear!
Hurry up, brother-in-Iaw...
The aircraft must have Ianded.
But, dad, I don't
want to come with you!
Is he returning from
the airport, Dad?
- He's going to stay with us!
- I couId have met him at home.
Why did you have to drag
me here, aII the way?
The moment he Iands in India,
I want you to be the first girI...
...he sets his eyes on
and faIIs in Iove with you, too.
Whom wiII he marry,
if he faIIs in Iove with her?
- Why? He'II marry me!
- You?!
What wouId peopIe think, if you
continue dragging me Iike this?
They'd onIy think that the
father and daughter ...
... Iove each other deepIy!
And that the father's puIIing
her away for her own good!
That's not right, brother-in-Iaw.
They'd think that your daughter
is in Iove with a hooIigan...
...which is why you're
sending her away abroad!
Your mouth stinks!
Use some adhesive to shut it!
Greetings, Mr Sharma... How are you?
- I'm fine.
- What brings you here?
To pIay a game of
cricket, of course!
I'm here to receive my friend's son.
Can't you see that much?!
Watch it, brother-in-Iaw...
The garIand wiII snap!
This girI isn't made
of fIowers to...
- Where's MaIa (garIand)?
- It's in your hands.
Not this, you idiot!
Where's MaIa, my daughter?
That's right.
Where is she?
Here you are!
And I've been Iooking for
you aII over the pIace!
- Come cIoser, wiII you.
- Why is that?
Because my father wants to be a grandpa.
And my uncIe wants...
Keep your distance!
I'm worried, anyway.
Do you know, my father has
imported a brand new hero ...
... for me from America!
That deserves an appIause!
To weIcome the new hero!
That American is supposed
to marry me, you know?
- I see! But, that's wonderfuI!
- What did you say?!
It seemed as if someone
had pushed me from behind!
Put the matrimoniaI neckIace
around my neck, my Iove!
And Iet this MaIa adorn your neck!
Move aside! I'm not interested
in such things, okay?
Is that so?
I've apoIogised to you thrice,
for faIIing on you just once.
- But you've stiII pushed me!
- I haven't pushed you, sir.
I wonder what's happening!
This chap faIIs over girIs,
even as he waIks around!
Let's have some Iove,
before you go!
Now Iook! I can't waste time
on these siIIy things, okay?
Can I atIeast have a
few dozens of kisses?
Why are you being a bore?
Just get Iost!
- Let's share it, pIease!
- No way!
- What was that?
- I said nothing. It's your ears!
Hi, there!
Do come here... Come over!
I'm Sundari Motwani,
from the women's organisation.
I'm the one who has organised
this programme for you.
This is my daughter, Roopa...
Looks Iike my sister, doesn't she?
That's Prem (Iove),
Roopa... You may Iove him!
I mean, say a ''heIIo'' to him!
But why are you caIIing them over?
To make them ask you
to give me a kiss!
But if they come over,
I'II be in troubIe!
Then quietIy give me
a kiss, in that case!
Won't you behave yourseIf?
That's a fast boy, isn't he?!
You've Iistened to my
prayers at Iast, O Lord!
- That chap's kissing her...!
- What am I supposed to do?
Did you see what your
daughter has done?
She's ruined aII the
efforts I had put in.
I'd taken her to the airport...
...so that he'd see her
there and approve of her.
I wonder where she's disappeared!
Whose daughter is she, after aII?
It's I, who spoke!
Where did you disappear
at the airport, Dad?
Do you know how worried I was?
That's wonderfuI!
Now she's accusing me!
Was it we who disappeared
or was it you?! You decide this!
It's your mistake.
You've spoiIt her
with your pampering.
She's taken after you.
What are you standing here for?
The American is upstairs...
Go and keep him company!
Sure!
After I've kept him company...
...he'II run away from India
and head straight for the U.S.!
Now Iook!
Don't do something funny...
- What's that now?
- Everything is fine!
Just because the Americans
didn't Iet you sing and dance...
...you've bought yourseIf a
ticket to India, have you?!
But you won't achieve
anything here!
You'd better return quietIy.
It's you?!
You're fantastic, my Iove!
You've even packed
off the Yankee...
...and Ianded in my bedroom!
Now Iook... I'm not
Raja... Leave me aIone!
What's up?
What happened!
- Who's she?
- She's my sister's daughter.
- How's she reIated to you?
- This man's my sister's husband.
Let me speak!
That's my daughter, MaIa.
Forgive me, my Lord!
My benefactor... my dear father!
I've taken him for my husband,
with aII my heart and souI!
How did the Indian traditionaI
spring from western?
Which was the button that
you pressed, son-in-Iaw?
It's as if we are watching a
new channeI, aII of a sudden!
Now Iook... I'm no son-in-Iaw!
My name is Prem MaIhotra.
This chap can't be your son-in-Iaw.
Did I ask you for your opinion?
I won't speak anymore.
I aIways get a scoIding,
when I open my mouth!
I'm Sundari speaking.
This is Prem here.
At what time is the programme
scheduIed to begin?
It's scheduIed for 6 p.m.
But you must be there
at 7 p.m. sharp.
- At 7 p.m. ? Why is that?
- That's Indian punctuaIity!
Nobody pays attention to those
who are punctuaI in this country!
The Iatecomers are
considered to be stars!
No, thank you.
I'II be there at 5...
... and begin the
show at 6 p.m., too.

I'm Tiger's mentor.
What brings you here?
It's nothing much, Inspector.
I have about a 1 00 trucks
pIying in the country...
...which transport hashish,
ganja and other narcotics.
You don't have to be surprised.
Every cop here knows about it.
But they keep their Iips seaIed.
Sit down, UncIe.
If I'm not mistaken, Inspector...
...the Government pays you about
5000 Rupees a month for your job.
But I wiII pay you
50000 Rupees a month.
Besides which, for esteemed
guests, such as you are,...
...I keep the doors of my
guest-house aIways open!
I'm your type of man, too.
- I see.
- That's right.
I onIy accept a saIary
that pays for my efforts.
By the way, for guests Iike you...
...I have a IittIe
''guest-house'' in there, too.
I've aIready been
transferred nine times.
And I'm prepared for the 1 0th time.
Now Iook, my boy...
I have more experience in years
that you have at your age.
Listen to me carefuIIy
and try to understand it.
ReIease aII the trucks
that you've confiscated.
That wouId be in
your own interests.
And what happens,
shouId I refuse to do so?
Think of your wife
and kids, Inspector.
Because I didn't want the
threats of crooks Iike you ...
... to affect me I
haven't even got married.
What a pity!
Aren't you married then?
You mean, you have no one
to cry over your dead body?
May the Lord bIess him!
- What can I bring for you, sir?
- Get me a pIate of ''samosas''.
How's it going, Ma'am?
This is a nice wrist-watch.
How much is it worth?
It costs 4,500 Rupees.
I ask you for ''samosas'',
and you bring me potato-fritters!
Get Iost!
You just said it's a nice watch!
And you've fIung it away!
I don't know what's wrong with me!
Rupa! You?!
How about it?
What's up with you?
PIease save me from him!
- Let me go!
- Let her go.
How is she reIated to you?
I can't say that.
But she does seem to be your sister!
That was a nice punch you
Ianded... Let me go now...
- Not here!
- Oh, no!
- Did you say something?
- Did you say something?
- Not a word from me.
- I didn't say anything either.
Go outside and get
a beteI-Ieaf for me.
But,... okay!
I'II go and get it...
... but you must go
upstairs for the cup of tea.
That's where I'm headed!
Gotcha!
Gotcha!
But why catch hoId of me?
Get him... he's the ruffian!
You're the worst
ruffian of them aII...
And it's your arrest that
wiII get me a promotion!
Hit me... Go on!
Hit me!
How did I hit a cop?!
It's going to be a IegaI mess now!
Got him!
I won't Iet go!
-That's where he must have gone.
-That's where he must've headed.
Okay.
Look for him, I'II go home.
No way.
You Iook for him!
Who's that?!
- Son-in-Iaw!
- Father-in-Iaw!
- My respects, Sir!
- BIess you, son!
But there's something
I can't understand.
Why did you have to
jump the gate and...
I'm used to it, you know...
Ever since I was a kid!
As a kid? But his father
said he was a singer who...
- They have a huge Iawn, he said...
- Never take a Ioan!
I'd Iand in troubIe, what say?
This is giving me a headache.
Let's go inside
and taIk about it.
Instead of getting Iocked up in
there it's better to foIIow him!
This chap is feeIing terribIy
shy to teII me what's happened.
You teII me now,
what he did to you...
...that you even passed out?
- Mom! The thug!
- Am I a thug?
- Not you! The one you bashed up!
- Did I bash up someone?
There was this deadIy ruffian
who caught hoId of me...
And this gentIeman beat him up
and made mincemeat of him!
You must be exhausted
after the fight, son.
How about some chiIIed-beer
and crisps, then?
No, thank you.
I drink onIy miIk.
Here you are...
Have a gIass of miIk.
Pour the miIk in a dairy, fatso!
Why give it to me?
But you must have the miIk!
- Are you crazy?
- Why did you ask?
What he says is right.
Where's the gIass?
BIoody idiot!
Let me have the gIass!
- Here you are...
- But I just can't digest miIk.
- Then what can you digest?
- I aIways find my food!
- And what is that?
- Let me show you...
It's over there!
Brother-in-Iaw... Here I am!
- I think he's the wrong guy.
- I'II smash your ugIy face!
He can't be our guy!
He's onIy thrown the cork at you...
I'II smash a bottIe on your head!
Here you are...
Great stuff!
AbsoIuteIy unaduIterated!
Have you Iaced this
miIk with something?
OnIy sugar, apart from the water
the miIkman must've mixed in it.
I see... But why is it so strong?
Why am I getting the feeIing
that I'm having hard-Iiquor?
- It's giving me a kick!
- There you are!
You're bound to get a kick,
when Rupa serves you a drink!
Go ahead and have
it... Have some more!
Your Dad's a fantastic guy,
I must say!
But he's not as good as I am!
Another word from you, and I'II
shove my foot in your mouth!
'Your buiIding is so high
and the Iift is not working'
'I can't come even though
my heart is wiIIing'
'Come, my Iove with the band'
'Your memory troubIes me,
come to me, O my groom'
'I'II come running for you'
'And I don't mind cIimbing
the stairs to meet you'
'You are my sweetheart
and you have to come'
'And you wiII have to
bear aII my tantrums'
'Due to this storm,
we are in troubIe'
'Even if I want to come,
my heart doesn't support me'
'Wherever you go,
I am behind you'
'You puII me towards
you Iike a magnet'
'Where are you going
with you eyes shut'
'You wiII come under
MichaeI's cycIe!'
'You are far away,
even though you are near me'
'The girI is strange,
she winks at me'
'Mumbai is on strike,
the trains aren't running'
'How shaII I come,
even if I want to come'
'There is no eIectricity
and the Iights are off'
'How shaII I come,
even if I want to come'
What do you mean by
bIocking my path?
Tiger has decided when
you wiII die, my boy.
OnIy the ceremoniaI coconut
now needs to be broken!
Why did you scream Iike that?
Have you seen something?
- Yes, I did.
- Did you hear the deceased scream?
Yes, I did.
WiII you teII anyone of what
you've heard and seen here?
I'II teII the court about it.
Brother!
What's happened?!
Who was it?
Who did this to you?!
Brother...
That man, Tiger,...
Ever since your father
has passed away...
...you aIways feed thousands
on every death-anniversary.
But these offerings wiII not
pacify your father's souI...
...unIess you perform
the Iast rites.
So why don't you perform
the Iast rites today?
No, priest.
TiII such time as I kiII
my father's assassin...
...I wiII not perform
the Iast rites!
You get down to beating
up women now, eh?
You caII yourseIf Tiger and
behave Iike a bIoody dog!
Okay, then... Get up, you punk!
Who's this young chap who openIy
goes about caIIing me aunty?!
Don't you recognise me?
I'm Tony! I used to
be your favourite kid!
Where were you aII these years?
I was in Singapore...
Singapore?!
What profession were you into?
I was into many things, aunty.
Do you know, aunty,
that the toiIets in Singapore...
...are famous for
their cIeanIiness?
And who's responsibIe for that?
None other than I, indeed!
Were you a sweeper in Singapore
then? How disgusting!
Good God!
The Indians are reaIIy fiIthy!
They spit anywhere they pIease!
But I aIways carry my broom,
which is famous for hygiene!
By the way, aunty,
where is my future wife?
Your future wife?!
How couId you ever imagine that
I'd get Rupa married to you?
Your husband had said,
on his death bed...
...to get married!
You idiot!
He had toId me to get married again!
When I haven't married again,
how can you get married too?
Besides, it's Prem I'II
get Rupa married to.
Do they have no
mirrors in Singapore?
Do you know how you Iook?
And you're out to get married? Tch!
Are you rejecting me, too, Rupa?
I'm very good at
keeping things cIean.
Besides, you must remember...
...I'II kiII the man you intend to marry!
Who's he anyway?!
He's MichaeI Jackson,
when he dances.
And as handsome as Jackie Shroff.
And when it comes to stunts,
he's no Iess than Jackie Chan!
'By your constant
coming and going,...'
'... you have made my heart yours'
'When you saw me and I saw you,
my heart became yours'
'TeII me, when did you
faII in Iove with me'
'At the first sight,
when I saw you'
'Why can't you take
your eyes off me?'
'How much ever I see you,
my thirst is not quenched'
'It's my first Iove and
my heart is restIess'
'And I am waiting for you, my Iove'
Tony has arrived from Singapore.
He's forcing me to marry him.
- I see.
- What do you see?
Won't you do anything,
if he forces me to marry him?
What can I do?
You'II have to fight him!
Bash him up!
I haven't harmed a mosquito in
my Iife. How wiII I bash him up?
Come and sit down.
Now that we're here,
Iet's eat something.
I can't read EngIish...
Read it for me.
Do you have fritters?
Hurry up and get us
two pIates of fritters.
- Get me a Iemonade.
- And haIf a cup of tea!
What are you Iooking at
me Iike that for, darIing?
I can't do without you anymore.
- When wiII you marry me?
- Marry you?
Let my sister get married first.
After that is done,...
Do you even have a sister?
Sister?!
She means the worId to me!
I've even found a suitor for her.
Once she gets married,
we can have aII the fun,...
Here's the pIate of
fritters you asked for.
- We had asked for sandwiches...
- And he's got us fritters!
Is this how they serve it?
Don't we pay for what we have?!
Wait tiII I set him
right... Stay here!
- So, you're the guy, eh?
- Leave him aIone!
But why must you fight with me?
Because you are the onIy
obstacIe between Rupa and I.
And I can't marry her,
tiII you die!
Do you want to beat me up?
Do you reaIIy want to
give me a thrashing?
WiII you reaIIy hit me?
Watch out... I'm going to the Ioo!
You take me for a
cheapster, do you?
WiII you throw those
fritters at us again...
...ones that Iand in my mouth?
Get me another pIate. Quick!
- Where were you going?
- Are you out of your mind?!
Have you just waIked
out of the nut-house?
Not the nut-house!
I'm from Singapore!
But why did you push me?
You're gonna get more
than just a push!
- That hurts, you rat!
- Hurts, eh?!
I know you're fond of fighting!
But Iet him go now!
But why did he start the fight?
- Let's go!
- Let me get one Iast kick at him!
Let's shake hands, Prem!
You're fantastic!
You've packed him
off to Singapore ...
... without even a passport!
- But I've done nothing!
- Now... don't pretend! Okay?
Let's go!
That girI has decided to testify
against you in the Court.
If she makes it to the Court...
HoId it, UncIe!
That girI and her brother must
not make it to the courts!
Give it a thought...
think of a way out, UncIe!
We approve of your sister.
NeeIam approves of your son, too.
Isn't that right, NeeIam?
Speak up.
Here's what we'II do...Iet's get
the wedding-date...teII them!
He's onIy saying that we must
finaIise the date of the wedding.
That's okay, isn't it?
So, Iet's get cracking then...
Keeping in view the testimony
and evidence at hand...
...this court has
reached the concIusion...
...that Tiger, aIias RatanIaI...
...has murdered Inspector Sharma.
This Court, therefore,
under section 302 of the I.P.C...
...awards the accused
a death sentence.
- How are you, my friend?
- TeII me about yourseIf!
I am fine.
The joy one experiences in
returning to one's motherIand...
... is aIways unique.
It's been ages since we Iast met...
- And how's your wife?
- What do I say?
She's been a Iiving corpse...
...ever since that incident
that took pIace years ago.
We've made a vegetabIe
out of her, ...
... feeding her medicines everyday.
Don't worry.
The AImighty takes His own time,
but He puts things right.
Who's this oId man,
who's pretending to be your father?
- He's reaIIy my father.
- Stop pretending now, okay?
And Iook at your ''Mother''...
She's been perfectIy trained!
She's putting up
such a naturaI act!
Take her away to the
bedroom, my dear.
Sure. Let's go...
So, MaIhotra... we're
not friends anymore.
Why?! You don't intend
to fight with me, do you?
We're reIatives now...
You're the father of my son-in-Iaw!
- But that's great news!
- Great news, my foot!
I shouId be mourning!
Don't you expect dowry from me?
- Come on! I can't do that, Sharma!
- Won't you? ReaIIy?!
But teII me something...
Has my son consented too?
Consented? He's even sung
a coupIe of Iove-songs!
He sings weII, reaIIy...
And here he is!
- Do you Iove MaIa, Prem?
- Love?!
She isn't even worthy
of being hated, Dad!
Oh, come on!
I know you're a good actor.
Now quietIy teII them that
we're getting married. Go on!
Marry her?!
No thanks, Dad!
I've had enough of your
pIay-acting, okay?
Stop acting as an
American-returned ...
... and teII them the truth!
But we have reaIIy come
in from America, dear!
I see! Was it America, or was
it the suburb of Andheri?!
- The bIoody crook!
- Never puII them by the tie, dear...
...no matter who it is!
Mr MaIhotra is Prem's father.
They're reaIIy from America!
My naive father! Have you been
taken in by this fraud, too?
Now wait a minute...
This chap is a known criminaI
from the sIums of Dharavi...
...and this chap is a
crook from the same area!
Had you known the truth, ...
... you wouId not have
agreed to the marriage...
...which is why he's dragged
aIong these fake parents!
- WiII you wait another minute?
- How Iong wiII I wait now?!
Do you want me to present his
sister, if you don't beIieve me?
I don't think you're nuts...
You're pIain cuckoo!
- Now Iisten to me...
- BeIieve me, Dad! It's true!
If we hang around
any Ionger, Dad, ...
... we're going to
Iose our sanity, too!
Your daughter has reached the
Iast stages of insanity, Sharma.
You must immediateIy rush
her to a mentaI hospitaI!
But such a thing has never happened!
Now Iisten, MaIhotra...
Let me fix the American today!
It's going to be the
Iast day of his Iife!
You'd have a son, have you?!
Take a Iook, my friend!
Someone's forgotten
his bag in the car!
It's because of guys Iike
this that we survive!
It must hoId a fortune!
Go and get it... Go on!
- I've got the bag!
- But, who are you?
This is no time for jokes!
I've got the Ioot...
Come on!
Let's scoot!
Now Iook... I'II summon the poIice!
You haven't gone mad, have you?
You asked me to grab the bag,
and I did. So, Iet's go!
WeII, okay. Now go and keep the
bag, from where you've picked it.
Keep it back?!
But I'II get mad, if you
ask me to bring back again!
Go and keep it, he says!
He's gone crazy!
Move aside!
- Where's the bag?
- Are you out of your mind?!
Where's the bag, I say!
You first ask me to steaI the
bag, from the car, which I did!
And you say, keep it back there.
And I did!
And now you ask me,
''where's the bag?'' !
Why don't you admit
you've chickened out?
That you have no guts!
- Sure. Why don't you get it then?
- Here goes... just watch!
The idiot!
There's Raja!
Let's hide...
- Who are you?!
- Is that Vidyarthi?
Thank God you're aIive!
This is the right pIace!
Let me reIieve myseIf.
From where did you steaI my Iooks?
You're the one who got into a
fight at the restaurant, right?
- But who are you?
- I'm Prem MaIhotra. From America.
I see! So you're the one
from America, are you?!
MaIa's father mistook me for you...
He said, ''Come here, son-in-Iaw.
Have this... have that...!''
What's brewing between you
and that guy from Singapore?
- Nothing...
- He's aIready attacked me twice!
- I even faced a bomb-attack today.
- A bomb-attack!
He wants to kiII me, Mr Raja...
...because I'm in Iove with Rupa.
And he wants to marry her.
Don't invoIve me in
this mess, aIright?
Go and teII him right now that
we're two different guys!
If I were to teII him the truth,
your wedding wouId be endangered.
- How's that?
- That's because...
... Mr Sharma is getting
MaIa married to you...
...because he thinks
you're no one but me.
But if I teII him the
truth, it wiII onIy...
WeII, okay.... I agree
what you say is true.
But we won't hide the
truth from our girIs. Okay?
Okay. I'II go and fetch MaIa then;
and you go and bring Rupa.
But why wiII you go
to fetch my girI?
Because that guy from Singapore
is shadowing my girI, you see.
WeII, aII right... I'II go
and bring your girI.
But keep your
distance from my girI!
She has this habit of cIinging on!
- ShaII I Ieave then?
- Go ahead.
- Can I go and get your girI?
- Go on!
- I won't, if you ask me not to.
- Go on, or you'II get a sIap!
Very weII then.
Here I go!
Strange chap!
He's not a nut, is he?
Who is it?
Rupa, my chiId!
- What's wrong, Mom?
- Come here! Quick!
Let me go!
Now, that's something...
And who are you?
How are you, my raspberry?
Raspberry?!
Why are you using such Ianguage?
But that's how I
aIways taIk, don't I?!
Come on... Iet's take
a waIk in the garden!
Prem! You're fine, aren't you?
Let's go for a waIk... Come on!
My God!
Your rations for breakfast are cut off.
You wiII not eat anything.
You'd better understand that!
- Is Miss MaIa there?
- ''Miss'' MaIa, he says!
What is it with MaIa now?
To rush her to the
mentaI hospitaI, eh?
To the garden, actuaIIy.
She's been caIIed over.
- What was that?
- CaIIed, in the sense that...
His heart beckons, I suppose.
He's in Iove with her!
Love, eh?
But wait a moment...
He refused the match in front
of his father the other day.
ActuaIIy, you don't
know how my father is.
Had I toId him then,
that I'm in Iove with MaIa...
...he'd have been furious.
He's come up with a pIausibIe
expIanation at Iast!
But you had given me a scare!
But Iet's ceIebrate... Come on!
- What's this?
- It's Iiquor, of course!
But I don't drink.
There you go again!
You knocked off a whoIe bottIe,
the other day!
Did I?
Now, brother-in-Iaw...This chap
seems to be a wrong-number!
Why must you pick the
phone to get wrong caIIs?
- CouId you caII Miss MaIa, pIease?
- Have a sip...
- PIease caII her outside...
- Let's ceIebrate first!
What have you come here for?
To take you to the
garden, Miss MaIa.
''Miss MaIa'' ?!
What's aII this nonsense about?!
It's a wrong number!
He's being so formaI...
It just doesn't
jeII... For instance...
You Iove me then, don't you?
Those in Iove,
wiII aIways be in Iove.
- You'II marry me, won't you?
- Those who Iove, wiII aIso marry
I'm sure, it's a wrong caII!
I'm positive! 1 00 per cent!
How can you be so sure
that it's a wrong caII?
I'II prove it to you!
Just come aIong... Come on!
Let's go!
What have you brought
me here for, Prem?
Let me Iight a cigarette first.
Do you smoke?
I smoke... and aIso drink. So what?
You're a Iiar!
Here comes the sticky one!
What an idiot!
He's carted the father aIong, too!
- Let's get cracking!
- Pardon me?
You said it was something important.
So, what is it?
That's right.
But Iet them get here first.
- Who are ''they''?
- By ''they'', I mean...
- You're Raja, aren't you?
- Yes, I'm Raja, of course.
- It's a wrong caII!
- Now just wait, okay?!
But I've toId you that
it's a wrong caII!
Your eyes are rotten, Iike your mind!
Now just shut up!
You're simpIy suspicious...
I'm reaIIy Raja.
But my Raja never reaIIy
keeps these distances.
He first hoIds my hand,
and then speaks!
Hey! Lay off!
Lay off, or I'II bash you up!
Do you agree now,
that this is no wrong caII?
I wiII not agree,
tiII I breathe my Iast!
Last breath, eh? Let me make
you breathe your Iast then...
Where has he gone?!
I'd sent you to
fetch MaIa, hadn't I?
Did you tag the father aIong to
give her away in the wedding?
Is her uncIe part
of the dowry we get?
You're mistaken... Now, why
wouId I bring them aIong?
They came hidden in the
boot of your car, you ass!
Why shouId they have
hidden in the boot?
I'd have brought them seated,
had they onIy toId me.
- Of aII the nuts I've met...
- What are you upto in there?
Who's that?
Don't stand there asking ''who''.
It's MaIa. Open the door for her!
I can't open the door for her.
Go ahead and open it yourseIf.
Open up! Quick!
What are you up to?
WiII you open the door
or do I box your ears?
What were you doing? And where
were two voices coming from?
- It was Raja and I...
- Raja and you?!
I mean, I'm Raja.
This is how I taIk,
when I'm excited.
But why did you Ieave
me behind and rush here?
The song-and-dance
reaIIy wore me out.
- I came here for a bath.
- A bath, eh?!
Great! It's going to be fun!
Just the two of us!
Let's bathe together!
- But we can't bathe together!
- Why not?
- Before marriage, it's a sin to...
- Come on now!
- Come on!
- But I won't take off my pants!
Take off your trousers,
whiIe I go and change.
What are you Iooking at?!
My God, brother-in-Iaw..
...there's a Iot of
hanky-panky in the bathroom!
ShameIess creature! It must be
my daughter and son-in-Iaw...
Do you want to watch them...
Get down immediateIy!
WeII now, my boy... TeII me,
why have you stripped?
Your girI has forcibIy
stripped me ...
... and has asked me
to bathe with her.
- I see!
- May I bathe with her?
Great! If she asks you
jump in deep waters, ...
... wiII you take the pIunge?
Just get Iost, you bum!
- There's soap in my nose...
- Stay in the waters!
Listen... I couId hear
two voices again!
Must say, darIing...
You have amazing ears!
PeopIe are hard of hearing...
And you actuaIIy hear more!
But why have you worn
your cIothes again?
I'II strip, if you
so wish, darIing!
Go and quickIy change... Go on!
The Iessons I've Iearnt
from MichaeI Jackson!
You were out just now...
How did you take off
your cIothes so quickIy?
I was dying to bathe with you,
you know... That's how...
I don't know why... but
I'm getting confused.
Hey! What's wrong with you?
You were fine just now...
Have you gone seniIe?
Here I am... in one piece!
I can't see anything, thanks
to the Iather you have on you.
But you're seeing doubIe-images
of everything. Come to me...
Get going, you ass!
Or you'II get a whack from me!
We've bathed enough...
Let's get out of this now.
- How was the bath?
- It was great fun...
When you bathe after a
month... it's bound to be fun!
I'II go and change.
You?!
How have you got here?
- Why? I waIked here!
- I wiped your head just now!
Then how did you get
that Iather on your head?
To get myseIf wiped again, ...
... I appIied some Iather
on my head and shouIder.
I see!
What are you doing here?
''Prem'', she says... Who's Prem?
And she caIIs you
Raja... Who's that?
Who are you?
- I'm Rupa. Who are you?
- The name is MaIa.
- What are you doing with her?
- He was having a bath with me.
What?! You Iove me,
but you bathe with her?!
That's okay?
I'II bathe with you, too.
Stop cIinging to him...
He's in Iove with me.
That's not true!
He Ioves me!
You first ran into
me with the jeep...
...and even sIapped my bottom!
Didn't you meet me at the airport
and kiss me pubIicIy?
You conned my father,
got into my house...
...and got me to dance with you?!
You got into a brawI for me,
carried me home...
...and sang a
Iove-song with me, too!
You bIoody cheat!
Two-timer!
They've fainted!
Both of them!
The thief!
Catch him!
You've stoIen the wagon
and I've pinched this bag!
Have you stoIen again?
Cut the comedy, okay?
Save me now... wiII you?!
You're Iooking for the bag-Iifter, right?
He's in there.
- Get him!
- Let me go! Leave me aIone!
Don't hit me... pIease!
It hurts... it reaIIy hurts!
Just hand him over to the poIice.
Hey, reIax... What's
wrong with you, Raja?
I won't spare you... I'II
get even with you, you swine!
Is he scared himseIf
or is he scaring us?
I don't need to scare you!
You're aIready scared stiff!
Just teII me where
your boss, Raja, is!
You can't make him teII you that,
even if you're born again!
You get that now, don't you?
Your sidekick is reaIIy
wiser than you are!
He's caIIed you my sidekick!
I've seen it in the movies
that during a ''fracture''...
...during a ''torture'',
they have the big Iight switched on!
And, no sooner than the
Iight is switched on...
...the cuIprit
confesses to his crime!
- I know nothing! I swear...
- Train it on the convict!
TeII me now... Where is Raja?
He's not getting scared at aII!
Try moving the Iight.
- Do it yourseIf.
- Who'II hit him, if I move it?
He'II be the one to bash
you up! Just move the Iight!
I'II deaI with you Iater...
- Let go... Hurry!
- Leave it aIone!
What was that?
- Then why didn't you teII me?!
- How'd you be eIectrocuted then?
- He's a bIoody 'tooI'.
- What?!
You mean, 'fooI', don't you?
You're right, too!
Why do you keep caIIing
me again and again, wife?
I'II get you the Iipsticks,
and the works you've asked for!
Is that a poIice-station
or a cosmetics-store?!
Who are you?
Don't you know how to
taIk to the Commissioner?!
I couIdn't recognise
your voice, sir...
You've achieved a Iot,
by arresting Raja's assistant!
The poIice department
is proud of you!
I'm very happy with you, too.
But you must set RangeeIa
free immediateIy.
Set him free?
Why is that, sir?
It's surprising that ...
... a wise Inspector Iike you
shouId ask such a question!
The moment you set
RangeeIa free, ...
... he'II go straight
to his master...
...and with you hot on his heeIs...
...you can arrest Raja, too!
That's it! You'II be made S.P.,
from the D.S.P that you are!
BriIIiant idea, sir! But I've
been made the DSP, haven't I?
Am I now empowered to
suspend a constabIe, sir?
Sure! You have aII
the power now, buddy!
- Let RangeeIa go.
- I'II set him free right now!
- What is it?
- Let RangeeIa go!
Go on. I'm going to foIIow you!
And I'II arrest Raja, too!
- Are you sure?
- AbsoIuteIy!
- That's great...
- He asks me if I'm sure!
- What fooIishness is that?
- The Commissioner had caIIed...
He asked me to Iet the guy off.
And I've been promoted!
But the Commissioner's away
in DeIhi for a conference!
- Whose caII was it then?
- It was Raja...
He caIIed you from the
pubIic-phone outside.
- Arrest him! PIease!
- No way... Do it yourseIf.
PIease get him...
or he'II escape!
You Americans couId teach peopIe
a Iesson or two in punctuaIity!
Amazing punctuaIity!
You've driven here,
at the stroke of seven!
Go and get ready...
The Minister wiII be here.
The Minister is here! Go ahead.
I'II go and weIcome him.
- It's good that I've found you!
- It's good that we've found you!
That chap from Singapore
over there wants to kiII me.
He wants to kiII you, eh?
Let's see you raise your hands then.
I've got him at Iast!
Looks Iike a wedding...
Let's have some free-food!
What are you doing here?
And this dress... it's Iike our own!
You wiII say nothing nasty
about my cIothes, okay?
I've got it stitched from the
pIace a fiIm-star gets it!
That's great! But it's time for
the show... take him inside.
- This way, pIease...
- Leave me aIone!
I say! The sticky-one's fieId, isn't it?
Let's go!
Protect my honour, O Lord!
'The way you saw me,
my poor heart is wounded'
'We have heard that aII your
admirers move around you'
'FaII in Iove with me and
make my Iife worth Iiving'
'Once is not enough,
turn and Iook at me once more'
'WouId you Iike to
come for the Iast show'
'What are you thinking now?
Come, Iet us eIope'
'ShaII I show you the two
tickets for the night show'
'I'II sit cIose to you
and take you in a taxi'
'Don't consider me worthIess,
I have a Iot of money'
'I treat you to aII goodies'
'You are my Pepsi CoIa
and I am your Coca CoIa'
'We wiII drink coId
MangoIa in the intervaI'
'Hurry up or I wiII Iose my temper'
'Once is not enough,
turn and Iook at me once more'
'I see you everyday
and whistIe in a fiImi styIe'
'Since many days I wanted
to take you to a movie'
'The Friday evening is IoveIy
and the fiIm is new too'
'You needn't worry,
the theatre is air-conditioned'
'Even the fiIm showing
is the best fiIm'
'Govinda is the hero,
and Madhuri is the heroine'
'The ticket is of back rows,
and we wiII Iove to the fuIIest'
Why has the Commissioner come here?
To arrest me for
catching Raja, I suppose!
He's here to give me a
promotion for arresting Raja!
Which one of you has
arrested Mr Prem?
That's not Prem, Sir... It's Raja!
Raja! The most notorious
criminaI from Dharavi!
I've had a tough time
arresting him, sir!
You must now give me a promotion
and make me the S.P., Sir!
It's onIy to give you a
demotion that I have come here.
That's wrong EngIish, sir...
It's promotion, actuaIIy!
Set him free, ConstabIe.
PIease wait, sir...
That's not Prem. It's Raja!
It's not Raja, it's Prem, sir...
The famous singer, Prem.
And this chap has dared to arrest
such a famous personaIity!
He's Iying, sir.
He's Iying, I see... And you're
speaking the truth, I suppose?
Which is why I'II promote him
and give you a demotion instead!
How can you say that, sir?
I'II bring Mr Prem here right now!
I beg of you, sir...
PIease don't do this to me!
Which poIice-station
were you in earIier?
I was at the poIice station
at Shaitan Chowki, sir.
And you had such a
poor track-record...
...that they demoted you from
an Inspector to a constabIe!
I've aIways had an
impeccabIe record, sir.
But it's because of that
swine of a constabIe, sir...
...who has tarnished my
unbIemished reputation!
But I wiII not spare him, too.
So what if I'm not wearing the
Inspector's uniform anymore...
...and go around in these
humbIe constabIe's dresses...
...I'II fix him so good ...
... that he won't even be
a constabIe anymore...!
- Punk?!
- Mind your Ianguage!
But, that is exactIy how
you aIways addressed me!
That's onIy because you
never did deserve any better!
You've thrown your weight
around with me, haven't you?
I'II make you account for every
atrocity you've committed!
You wiII not serve
the Government...
...but be my personaI servant now!
You wiII fetch miIk
for my house everyday!
You wiII even drop my
chiIdren at schooI!
- You wiII get my Iunch everyday.
- No!
Not onIy wiII you heIp my wife
with her cooking every evening...
...but you wiII do the entire
Iaundry of my house, too!
You wiII bring my
chiIdren back from schooI!
It's time for me to take
the rounds of the prison...
- Go and get my Iunch.
- No...
Go on...!
Get back...
Why isn't he getting up?
Get him to stand up...
Oh, yes... I get it now...
He's very angry with me.
WeII, aII right... I'II
caII you ''Sir'' henceforth!
I'II do as you say!
I'II drop your kids at schooI
and fetch them back, too.
I'II serve you weII, okay?
Now get up!
Why doesn't he get up?
What if he doesn't...
...whom wiII I fight with?
Who wiII argue with me?
Okay! I won't even
taIk about a promotion...
...but who wiII heIp
me improve my EngIish?
You must show courage, Vidhyarthi.
Courage...?
But it's you, who has
aIways been my courage.
But you've deserted me
now... Ieaving me aII aIone!
You have aIways kept me company.
What right do you have
to desert me Iike this?
What right do you have...
Watch out...!
Everything wiII be aII right!
I think you're going
to have twins, too!
Send Raja over to
the hospitaI. Okay?
- Who's in the house?
- There's no one...
They're aII away at the hospitaI.
- How's NeeIam, doctor?
- Are you Raja?
- Yes, I am.
- She has to be operated.
Get me these medicines quickIy.
Wait here, whiIe I go
and meet the doctor.
Thank God!
You arrived just in time.
- Brother!
- Shut up!
Brother...!
If my sister comes
to any harm, Tiger...
...I'm going to hack you to pieces!
If you want to save your sister...
...just bring MaIhotra to us,
whom you saved at the hospitaI.
We'II have your
sister treated weII...
...and return her to you,
with the baby!
No way!
There's no way I wiII do that!
Don't be siIIy, Raja.
This chap whom you
want to protect ...
... and risk your sister's Iife...
...how is he reIated to you?
There's no time to waste!
Make up your mind, Raja!
If your sister is not
operated on, in an hour...
...it'II be impossibIe to save her!
Brother!
Where's MaIhotra?
Are you deaf?
It's you, I'm asking...
Where's MaIhotra?
Why aren't you teIIing me?!
Where is MaIhotra?
Why aren't you speaking?
Have you returned then?
You're returned, my son?!
- Geeta, you have...!
- This is our son.
That's right.
This is our son, Prem.
Cut the act with the oId Iady
and just come with me!
What is this you're saying, Prem?
I'm not Prem, okay?
I'm Raja!
- What sort of a joke is this...
- Leave him aIone, son...
I'm nobody's son, okay?
Just get Iost!
Mother!
That's my father, Raja.
I don't care how he's
reIated to you, you punk!
- I must onIy take him to Tiger.
- Don't do that, Raja.
Don't stop him,
my son... Just don't!
Perhaps he doesn't know that he
is taking not onIy your father...
...but his own father, too.
Let's not have a
father-son drama now, okay?
It's onIy a co-incidence
that we Iook aIike.
- QuietIy come aIong now...
- Listen...
What I'm saying is the truth,
my son... You're twins.
For 25 years after Iosing
you, your mother...
...was nothing but a Iiving corpse!
OnIy teII me this much...
No medicine has ever worked on
your mother in aII these years!
But a mere touch
from you has today...
...revived a corpse!
How did that happen?
Because, the bIood that
fIows in your veins...
...is the same that fIows
in your mother's veins too!
What's wrong, my son?
What has happened?
Tiger has kidnapped NeeIam.
He promises to return her,
onIy when I hand you over to him.
Hand me over to him then.
Raja is here with MaIhotra.
What do you want?
- Revenge. - Revenge?
Revenge for what?
Put that question to my father.
Take a good Iook! Those are
the Iast remains of my father!
I've preserved them with great
care for the Iast 25 years!
Do you know why?
OnIy to douse your bIood on it
before I perform the Iast rites!
Now Iook!
I've brought him here, as you wished.
Now you must keep your promise
and Iet my sister go.
You made a mistake by
trusting us, my boy!
A hero is one who
keeps his promise.
And the viIIain is known
by the promises he breaks!
Which makes them the father,
the son... and the daughter!
They're aII here, UncIe!
We'II tie them up in knots, Dad!
Just watch!
Get them!
Everything wiII be okay, my chiId.
- What's up?
- They've given me a thrashing!
But the viIIain aIways
gets beaten up by the hero!
It's my stammering-probIem...
Which expIains the pauses!
What are you staring at, you punk?!
We're twins!
Let me give him a few good punches!
This is no hand... it's a
hangman's noose, Tiger!
That's wrong! You're supposed
say... ''You're under arrest'' !
WouId you Iike to be a cop?
It was my mother's ''dream''
that I be a cop!
- What?!
- His mother aIways dreamt...
- ...of this guy being a cop!
- Her dream wiII now be fuIfiIIed!
I'II be a cop!
I'II catch aII the thieves!
And I'II beat them up reaI good!
I'II give them a thrashing!
- WiII you beat me up, too?
- How can I beat you up?
You're my brother, after aII!
Let's go then, okay?
