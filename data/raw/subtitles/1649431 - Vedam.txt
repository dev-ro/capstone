Who are you waiting for?
Go...go...go...

It will be impossible forever,

Every day there is some

And that is the place for success...
Every day there is some
deficiency throughout the life...
Without which there wilI
be no place for tomorrow...
Saying that this is not sufficient...
lt is achieving something here...
Witness the tomorrow
through today's dreams...
Fight and make yourself
efficient to win every day...
Put your indelible signature
on the time...
Saying that the time will stop
where you stop...
Start your story now itself
which studies earth...

PateI has called you,
why didn't you come, Ramulu?
I said I'd come.

Don't you know you

Why are you opposing, Padma?
Tell whatever you want with PateI.
Hey old man! if you don't

Unable to bear it anymore,

Isn't it my blood that you

Why are you arguing with Rathamma?

Enchanting with beauty and

Mesmerizing with romance...
Leave the heart's thoughts

Leave the thoughts at the threshold...
Leave the issue ofvillage

Leave the rights and wrongs
to ancestors...
Leave the shyness to darkness...
Remove the screen and drapes...
Leave the first feeIings of loneliness...
Leave the bunds and fields...
Leave the puzzles to wind...
How nice it would be to fly away?
The world is a market of colours...
Everything here is a wonder...
What is the price of beauty?
Only few could judge, that much...
Chastity...
- Fake virtue...
Love and sacrifice...

Honour and virtue...

Nobody must say like that.

Let's manage it tomorrow.
Where were you all the day?
Masthan's men are combing foryou.
lt seems you took his bike.
They threatened to kill me
if you don't return the bike.
I begged them to spare me,
return their bike tomorrow.
Why don't you answer me? You collect
their money, can't you give them?
What are you doing with the money?
Your parents died leaving you to me,
and you're torturing me to death.
l'm struggling to meet the both ends and
you don't even bother to help an old lady.
You eat and roam Iike a wild bull.
I told mom l'll not come.
But we must make it at any cost.
Some guy is coming from Canada;
it's a kind of meeting the bride.
l'll introduce you to my mom.
We are going to the party.
We are meeting your mom.

Why do you need so much money?
Are you using drugs?
Who is Pooja?

Slum...slum...I'll drown you old woman!
Do you want me to bury in this slum?
Her bungalow will be the

She's a Princess!
Foryour face, you'll get a princess.

Hi mom!
Major KuIkarni called on phone,
he has asked you to come
tomorrow to fill the applications.
What do you mean by that?
I don't like tojoin Army.
What wilI you do then?
What are you planning
to become in life?
I've started a music troupe, a Rock Band.
You mean playing guitar
in hotels and bars.
Traditionally our familyjoins
Army or Air force but you...
Your grandpa served in Army,
yourfather was in Army,
When dad died, Army got a hero,

I'm not selfish, you're forcing
your dreams on me.
Is it my dream?
I'm telling you foryour career.
Tomorrow morning I'm going

l don't know what should l tell about
you if anyone inquires.
You don't need to tell, mom.
Everyone wiII tell great
about me with you.
Hey dark man! We can't choose to
be born as son ofAmbani.
One must be fortunate.
But ifwe plan weIl,
we can become son-in-law.
We must have little talent and
he must have a daughter.
First you must have Rs.40000.
Let's do one thing,
let's ask Ra.1000 loan from 40 peopIe.
40 people? Tell mejust one name.
l've become like this
lending you money.
Did you ever pay a penny in
the donation box oftempIe?
One who never repays money
lent to him is Cable Raju.
l'll beat you with slipper.
Bloody life! Not a soul in
world to Iend us Rs.1000.
You didn't leave anyone,
you've cheated all ofthem.
Dark man! Who will invest Rs.4000
trusting on us?
I've been trying your phone since
morning but it's switched off.
I forgot to charge it Iast night.
10 minutes since we missed the flight.
Always you're a problem,
how can you be so irresponsible?
When is the next flight?
- Not seat vacant.
Listen, its 500 kms from
Bangalore to Hyderabad.
Ifwe go by road, we can reach
in 8 hours by evening.
Great, come.
Rathamma used to send me
to bed even if I was sick.
Now we are on our own, sister.
We can take rest orwork as
and when we feel like, sister.
Okay dear, get up.
So what?
l've been listening to your
discussion since last night,
I want to talk to you.
What's it?
Your name?
- Why?
Just curiosity.
lf possible have a talk with you.
Not incense stick?
Who asked your name?
I told you because I like you.
Look Saroja, you're beautiful,
why are you into this cheap business?
l know what I'm doing,
but what do you do?
l reform the society.
Mother Teresa said hand that heIps is
more divine than praying lips.
l too say the same.
l helped to paint the black board
in my village school.
l helped my vilIage at great cost.
Infact recently l gave 6 apples free to

If it's necessary I toId them to cut
into pieces and distribute it.
Why are you telling me
your boring tales?
I'm coming to the point.
I want to so something with you.
What will you do with me?
- l'll help you.
Instead oftaking a lover every night,
if you marry me,
l'll take care ofyou.
Then, l'll have onIy one all nights.
Brother-in-Iaw, help me.
- Am I here to help you?
Why are you popping in
when we both are discussing?
I don't care about your past.
I don't care about caste or religion.
I don't want dowry or property.
I'lI help you.
Yuck! Get up! What?
Will you marry me?
Have you seen your face?
Why are you taIking

Cremate in an hour.
We need money for anything, uncle.
- What's your probIem now?

Please do something, uncIe.
- Yes uncle. We'll settle in life.
l don't have that much money,

UncIe, you can do if you decide.
- Stop it.
Raju, seII the bike.

I'll sell if you want to buy it.
Already he's after my fingers for
non-payment of cable dues.

- I know what wiII he be after.

Yes, anyone can do it
but not we.
We'lI sing espousing that in songs.
Can't differentiate between gold

What ifwe steal the temple bell?

Chain snatching is very difficult,

Raju, you made three mistakes.
You were born in slum
instead ofJubilee Hills.
Educated but snatching chains.
Tried to snatch Pooja's mother's chain.
Do you love that girl?
Sister is very beautiful, brother-in-law.
l spent a Iot to get her.
What you spent for her is very little.
What did you spend on?
Is it necessary?
- I want to see once.
Dark man! There are only two castes
in this world.
Haves and have nots.
Theirs is one caste and
ours is one caste.
Anyway l don't have any caste feeling

Thief!
I came foryou only.
Anyway we are meeting

unable to drive properly.
Okay, say sorry to mom
when you meet her evening.
Have you taken the passes?

What? He's like your son.
Madam, you please remember
he's your eIder cousin brother.
Remember it?
Don't forget it.
Do you've a stepney?
- Yes, but that too is flat.
You didn't stop there and
God stopped your car here.
I'll never do such a mistake
again in Iife.
Problems are normal for us.
You say as if I did flatten
the stepney wantonIy.
Had you come early,
we wouIdn't have missed the flight,
we wouldn't be in trouble now.
Why are you heckling me
stiIl for morning incident?
Sop the fight and think
about what to do next?
Pitch a tent there, let's sleep here.
We must get the stepney tyre vulcanized.
Where's the vulcanizing shop here?
They are like that, they'll fight

I don't fight it's you!
Okay, it's me.
Angry again!
What's that you don't like in me?

You mean?
A song is a lyric told musically.
What do you like in me?

Good voice.
Good music sense.

You weave clothes,

Does a cobbler own shoes?
Our lives too are similar, sir.
Thinking of cheating a policeman
and surviving in this world?
Cheating?
Did l fleece him or steal him?
Shut up! You get sold for money
and arguing with me.
Did you talk to Bullabbai?

Every man speaks about God.
Why should there be
problem about God?
Unable to understand the language
What's this?
In Telugu.
- Water!
ln Hindi, it is called as water!
- So what?
God too is like that!
In one language he's called as Rama,
in another language Allah,
and in another language
he's called as Jesus.
People are not fighting for religion.
They're fighting without knowing
what to caIl him!
lfthe entire world had one language
and one culture,
there wouId be one religion only.
Every minute...thinking before
taking a step...
Every minute...reining in the
flow ofthoughts...
Every morning, though dreams melt away...

- It's coming! Have tea till then.
Hey, give him tea.
To madam also.
- Okay.
l'll pay for it.
As if I owe them money!
Already they took Rs.2000 inside, uncle.
Like a man who went to police to report
missing son lost his wife too there.
This is also like that.
Would you like to have tea?
- No uncle.
We stole the chain neatly,
but bumped into poIice jeep blindly.
Should've bumped an ambulance,
you'd have landed up in hospital.
Good riddance!
Bloody fooI!
Please wait, let's go back immediately.
- Okay madam.
Uncle, grandma...
- Who will give us money then?

Why are you spoiling that girl's life?
You shameless creature!
Let's go.
We must know our place!
Just because I can do devotionals well,
Raghavendra Rao didn't make me music
director of devotional films he made.
This is also same.
You and that girl have
that much difference.
One must have money for everything.
Uncle, you didn't see the girl...
- Shut you!
You're responsible for this situation.
Don't get caught like this
and call me to get you out.
Face the music on your own!
l'm getting late for my work.

Who are you calling?
Where are you?
- I need to meet you urgently.

- What will he say?
Gold chain, 25%. share,
and Saroja whenever he wants.
You don't worry, just few days
and you'll be the boss.
Bloody! It was all because ofyou.
Had you come little earIier,
we wouldn't have got caught?
Boss...my foot boss...who gave
the chain the policeman took?
While getting down from the train,
l stoIe it from that BapatIa short man.
Now, my Lord Krishna has saved us.
What has he done? There's no God!
Ifthere had been,
why would our fate be like this? Get in.
Who told you about me, sir?
I've recognized you, sir, tell me.
Yes sir, I do have a good item!
Best one...family type.
Just now stepped in Hyderabad.
Ours is very strange job, sister.
Anyjob wouId fetch you more salary

Okay father-in-Iaw.
Revathi, pIease come.
- You go...go...
l'll pay you as soon the
operation is over, Ramulu.
Your grandson will go to the school.
Why are you so tensed?
I can't telI the truth looking
into her eyes.
Shall we go return then?
No, it's all over.
Today I must tell her the
truth at any cost.
But l'm scared.
What shall we do?
You tell her.
- To whom?
To Pooja!
- Oh no!
I beg you, leave me,
don't trouble me.
It's my life...say it carefully!
I loved her initially for money only,
but don't know when it started,

but due to unavoidable circumstances,
- What's that?
Due to unavoidable circumstances...
Please don't use Hindi words in Telugu.
lt's Telugu!
Where is Raj?

Running away with Masthan's money,

What's this, buddy?
You said it's all over.
Why this Rs.40000 again?
Don't know who invented this kiss?
Buddy, this is injustice.
Must do something and

Fell...fell...changed...changed...
This is a paper that changes hands
and changes the fate...
lt's a rupee that keeps flying from
one pocket to another pocket...
Rupee...it' a rupee...
To buiId castles or forts...
or to get cremated...
To eat a morsel offood...
or to kill anyone...
lt's a rupee...
How many coIours this chameIeon has?
Black or white?
The man who is devout of
this Goddess ofwealth...
Even God needs it to fill
the charity box...
Brother, man creates fake notes.
But notes?
- It creates fake men!
Wealth isn't there but here!
Brother, you know this in your life!
There's bread in toast,
but there's no dog in Hot Dog.
I can tell like this philosophy easily.
Every man is ready to advice!

To save a life or to win in a struggle...
