- THREE YEARS LATER
- You ingrate sons of bitches.
Don't you come back begging.
I'll find a star who'll make
Rothy look like nothing.
Just wait and see, bastards!
I'm going to show you!
I'm going to find a star.
Did you call for a driver?
Yeah, sure.
Just my freaking luck.
Hey, mister!
Wake up!
Make sure you wire my pay.
Don't even dream of bailing on me.
Okay?
Or I'm calling the police.
CONTRACT
What's your name?
Ji-hoon.
Got a surname?
It's JI.
JI JI HOON
Oh, that's your full name.
JI HOON
You must know Rothy
from the Golden Singers.
I was her producer.
So, do you want to
put on a gig with me?
Sorry?
Someone just cancelled a gig,
you can take that spot.
What are you talking about?
Here, it's your contract.
I don't understand.
Just read and sign it.
Mr. KIM!
Min-su, where are you?
Are you in here? Anyone?
The bastard's been running the place
behind my back all along.
Making any money yet?
You've got to pay us back, first!
- I'll get going.
- Hey.
Wait. Don't you want to
make some money with me?
I don't need money.
I told you, I arranged Rothy to
appear on the Golden Singers!
Who were those people?
Let's talk in the car, okay?
- Put your seatbelt on.
- You bastard! Stop the car!
Open the door!
Open the door!
Open it!
Open the damn door!
- KIM Min-su!
- Open the door, bastard!
Get out of the car!
Get the hell out of the car!
Mr. JEONG, I told you I'd pay you back!
Stop harassing me.
You're pimping me
out with interest already!
Did you just call me a pimp?
- Hey, kid! Open the door!
- Get out!
Open the door!
KIM Min-su, you asshole!
You son of a bitch!
You can't be satisfied with
singing inside a parking booth.
I'll make sure to put
a spotlight on you.
I could put you on the
Golden Singers show.
You could be on an actual stage!
Rothy?
ROTHY PRODUCED BY KIM MIN-SU
What's holding you back?
I can't figure you out.
There's nothing to worry.
You'll understand after a few gigs.
I can't sing in front of people.
What?
You can't sing in front of people?
That doesn't even make any sense!
The thing is,
I just can't.
Do you have stage fright?
Do I need to throw a
blanket over your head?
HANA RECYCLE
Get in.
We should pick a song everyone knows.
SEOL-LIN-MUN
What's going on?
Let's check it out! It
might be for a TV show!
What happened?
Are you okay?
JI Hoon!
Did he just faint?
I've had enough of you!
Watch your mouth, bitch!
How dare you raise your voice!
Get off of me! Screw off!
I'm going to smash
him along with his guitar!
JI Hoon, stop right there!
Can you tell?
It's Glastonbury. The
world's biggest rock festival.
You've been there?
Would you like to go, too?
Don't you want to be a singer?
You just have to trust me.
Well? Are you in?
What a pretty boy.
Thank you.
I hope you like the food.
Her MV reached a millions views
on Youtube in just two days!
Is that Notsy, or what was her name?
How's she doing?
It's Rothy! And she's
got nothing to do with me.
INSTALLMENT DEBT OVERDUE
Is everything okay with your nightclub?
Your scary looking friends
came by the other day.
Quit it, mom.
I got it under control. Stop
nagging me when I eat.
I lost my appetite.
Well, he finished all his food.
Did my son put you on a diet?
Dig in when he's not around.
My son's been working
hard to promote his singers.
But they turned their backs on him.
PRODUCER OF THE YEAR
Please.
Take good care of my son.
Of course.
It's been a long time since
he brought home a guest.
Forgive my ramblings.
Thank you for the food.
We'll tour the provinces.
Ten gigs in total, including
nightclubs and street busking.
I can't give up just yet.
It could be a huge
success, or a failure.
But we'll part ways with no regrets.
Have a drink.
I can't drink.
This is the Honam Jeilmun Gate.
Jeonju is known for bean sprout soup.
The poached egg is a delicacy.
There's a little problem.
He's got to wear a cardboard box.
No, he's pretty as a peach!
He plays the guitar
like he was born with it.
Fine, I get it. Okay,
150 dollars it is.
100 dollars? Fine, I'll take it.
A fire? No, I haven't heard.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Hello? Are you there?
Yes.
Hello? You bastard.
There are ten nightclubs in Jeonju.
Many closed down
since the business is slow.
But in the old days,
making it here meant
a direct ticket to Seoul.
Hear me? A direct ticket.
I managed to find you a gig tonight.
Please show all you got.
You won't even answer me.

Shove it up your nose!
Enough of this gloomy shit.
What's this? A music box?
Hey, karaoke dude!
Play something for us.
Okay?
Four, eight, seven, six!
It's Barefooted Youth!
Okay! Let's go!
Wait, we forgot to feed it money.
There you go, start playing!
You happy now?
- Excuse me.
- Min-su. Let me.
Let me take care of it.

Crap.

Anyways, he's quite a gem.
He's not a freaking human karaoke.
Karaoke or not, he plays great music.
Music is all about delighting
and impressing people.
And that's exactly what he did,
the customers were pleased.
I say 1,500 bucks a month,
if he plays four weekdays a week.
Sounds good?
Consider it an advance.
Treat yourselves to a warm meal.
Hey, bro.
Come on, we're leaving!
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's go!
We have six gigs left.
We'll split in half,
as per our contract.
Where are we going next?
Just follow me.
And we have eight gigs left.
Playing karaoke doesn't count.
Cover the front!

Let me introduce you
to a very special friend of mine.
Please greet him with
a big applause on three!
Ready? On one, two, three!
I present you my tip box!
It's awkward to talk about money.
No need to feel pressured, thank you!
If you don't have cash, I
accept credit cards, too!
This is where you'll sing today.
Where are you going? Keep watching.
- Watch him.
- You know what to do.
Let's go someplace else.
Geumnam-ro is the
place to be in Gwangju.
I don't like it.
He already got a thing going.
Let's just join the ride.
Not here.
Wait.
Like it or not, you're singing here.
Or find your way home on your own.
Let's call it a day, everybody.
You okay in there?
Cheers.
We're about to play a new song.
Everybody, come on!
Everybody, come on!
Gather around!
Alright, Mr. Box, you got
something. Sounds good.
Clap your hands, everyone!
Yeah, don't stop everybody.
And Mr. Box, join me!
Keep clapping!
Good, very good.
Yes, that's great! Don't stop!
Mr. Box!
One, two!
Stop being awkward
and just rock and roll.
Jump, jump!
Rock on, Mr. Box! Give him a big hand!
Surprise, surprise!
Champion!
Thank you.
I enjoyed it.
- You're good.
- Thank you.
Everything's a blur.
But you remember how you felt.
Well.
Your feeling is what matters.
How did you do it?
Do what?
- What did you tell him?
- I gave him some money.
Money?
Yeah, money.
What kind of money?
The money you made by playing karaoke.
You spent that?
A true producer knows
when to spend wisely.
Is that how you went bankrupt?
It was well spent to
teach you a lesson.
I didn't ask for it.
He seemed like a professional.
How much did you give him?
All of it. 500 dollars.
Then what about us?
We have the tip box.
What's for dinner?
When in Gwangju...
You must try meat pancake.
♪ It's raining cats and dogs ♪
♪ It washes away everything ♪
What brought you here?
It must be something important.
I'm looking for a stage to
help him get acquainted.
Thought he could give this place a try.
But there's a little problem.
He has to sing in a box.
In a box?
He's got stage fright.
Oh, dear. Is he ugly?
Come closer.
Excuse me, let me feel your face.
Closer.
He's cute.
Not as cute as me, though.
I'm kidding.
Then...
You can't see the
audience, just like me.
Come back tomorrow.
Bring him during the day
when there's no customers.
I'd like to hear him sing.
You can't see the
audience, just like me.
What do you feel about the audience?
They scare me.
How about when you're singing alone?
I'm happy, I enjoy it.
Then imagine you're sharing
your feelings with others.
You have a great bass voice.
Are you still inside the box?
Yes.
Min-su, will you help
him get out of the box?
JI Hoon, can you sing
What a Wonderful World?
Yes.
Do you need a score?
No.
Join me from the second
verse. Are you ready?
I can't sing in front of people.
Try closing your eyes, just like me.
When you close your eyes,
there's nothing but music.
A world of unfathomable depth and size
will unfold in front of you.
Min-su, please turn off the lights.
- Cheers!
- Cheers! Thank you.
I can see the sound of wind
blowing from beyond the horizon.
I remember being a child.
I loved seeing the sound of the ocean
through the seashell father gave me.
I wish I could see sounds like you do.
JI Hoon, try closing your eyes.
You two are so melodramatic.
That's enough poetry for the day.
Here's to JI Hoon's future!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Good evening, everyone.
My name is Nana.
I have a special guest tonight.
He's a very talented young musician.
Please give him a round of applause.
What a Wonderful World.
What's wrong?
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.
No, I was too arrogant.
I'm sorry, Min-su.
He seems like a good kid.
Don't push him too
hard, just be there for him.
You don't overcome your wound.
You embrace it like a friend.
It won't be easy,
but I hope you'd watch
over him until the very end.
I'll get going. Take care.
Now you're hiding under
a blanket? Get up, already.
We're all the way in Yeosu.
You've got to try the local kimchi.
Do you want some pickled crab?
I need to tell you something.
I can't sing in front of people.
I saw you whimpering at the pier.
Your contract isn't up
yet. Just sit down and eat.
You've been starving
yourself since last night.
I thought you couldn't drink.

How did I do?
Every couple who were here tonight
would never break up thanks to you.
Thank you.
Mom, my debt's been taken care of!
It's just an empty threat.
Come on, stop crying.
No, that's not what I'm saying.
Mom, I'll take care of it.
Don't worry, I'll talk to them.
Quit it already, it's been 25 minutes!
Is something wrong?
Yes.
Thanks.
What do we do now?
Whatever, we'll find a way.
What about the box?
I owe you this much.
I owe you my mother's life.
Min-su was a huge success.
He's just down on his luck.
How's your new business?
I barely manage and do what I can.
That's how life goes, you know.
Anyhow, you haven't changed a bit.
Are you messing with me?
Wait, pull over!
GANJEOLGOT COUNTRY FESTIVAL
What a great performance!
Thank you, Mr. KIM from Ulsan!
Please give him a big hand!
Now, let me introduce a
very special participant.
Our next participant is
a mysterious Box Man from Seoul.
He'll be singing the latest hit.
Chicken has never been more
popular since this song was released.
It's titled, Chicken Dinner Tonight!
Let's greet him with
a loud applause!
The Box Man will sing

Hey.
You two were unbelievable!
Believe it or not, I think this kid
could be a great country singer.
You could be a dancer, too.
- You know what? Forget it.
- I had so much fun.
Anyways, let's drink up.
Hey.
Here's to the Box Man!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
What's up with the depressing tune?
Is everything okay?
At least for this month.
My life is so pathetic.
My parents were in
debts all their lives, too.
Your debt, it's your box.
What?
Yeah, maybe.
There're so many boxes everywhere.
A box here, a box there.
It's a world full of boxes.
Will we ever get away?
It must be tough to sing in the box,
but don't you also feel snug in it?
Very.
Same here.
I hate debts but I just
can't get rid of them.
Debts made me look good.
Debts made me what I am.
I can't even tell who I
am without my debt now.
Remember what Nana told me?
When I closed my eyes, I
saw a much bigger world.
Maybe I was afraid to leave the box.
Maybe that's why I ran away.
I think I'll try again.
Outside the box.
Okay.
Outside the box.
Where are we going now?
Somewhere special.
Hyun-sik.
Min-su!
Hey.
Hop on.
What is this place?
Interesting, huh? Gypsy
music is the one true kind.
No taboo, no boundaries. Only freedom.
Look who's here!
Yo!
Min-su, here you are.
How have you been?
It's been a long time.
This place feels awesome.
Do you want to give it a try?
What should I do?
Just join them and enjoy.
Can I?
There's nothing to be afraid of here.
Min-su!
Come check this out.
Think about it, okay?
Have you decided yet?
I'm still thinking.
What's the problem? Just
play whatever you want.
Like what?
Nothing. Go your own way now.
Sorry?
Your contract is up.
We did all ten gigs.
What are you talking about?
Look.
It's over.
What's wrong?
Don't you get it?
We're done here.
Is this how you ended
things with Rothy?
Watch your mouth.
You dumped her.
Enough.
Just keep your precious box.
Tell me the truth.
You're scared.
Why'd you drag me all the way here
if you were going to bail on me?
Whatever, you'll be fine on your own.
So long.
When I closed my eyes, I
saw a much bigger world.
Maybe I was afraid to leave the box.
Maybe that's why I ran away.
What is it?
Did you do that on purpose?
Was it a test?
And you passed.
Think I can sing now?
Have you been to Busan?
No.
Play me the D chord.
