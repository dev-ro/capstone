Hello Mr Kaethner, gotta a minute?
Have to tell you about my thrilling idea.
No time, but give it a try.
Ok, you see: People are digging "Titanic", right?
Now look out:
We take some actors with costumes
Put' em all on a big ship
And have cameras installed in every room
The rich will be on the top floor
And the poor go in the basement
All playing for money
In the night we put the life saving boats
In the water or whatever and
After 30 days we kill the boat
The rich can keep their money
The poor go into water
Practically ''Titanic'' meets ''Big Brother''.
Imagine the quota on a Saturday?
This is going to be a hit!
A fabulous Hit!
Guaranteed !
Yeah, of course. Give it to me,
I have a look. - Thanks a lot!
Cool car.
- Yes.
Mr Kaethner?
- Spasti ...
The parking lot is full!
Fuck off!
Yeah!
What's this fucking shit?
Can I help you?
Gotta problem?
Wanna dig this?
Wanna dig this?
Wanna dig this?
Wanna dig this?
You want some more or what?
Some more? Dig this?
I can give it to you, old man!
Here we are again
''Get that supa baby'',
The show which is really telling
The truth about German men.
Three women, three men
Never met each other before,
Showing us their abilities
In parenthood today.
But we are all so thrilled
And waiting
For the grand finale ...
So why doesn't a nice young lady like you
Find the right guy
For marriage and kids, no?
Well, all my friends
They say,
It is because I am such
A perfectionist.
So if I - for example
Put some highlights in my hair,
This hasn't gotta be
Such baddie stripes,
But nice, fine highlights.
And such it is with me and
With Men it's just alike.
Well, yes ...
He must be faithful,
Have a job and be clean.
Haven't found him yet.
Oh ...
So Mareike, you must be a happy gal
Being with us here and now.
We will give you a big hand today.
And now honestly:
What do you think?
Who is going to make it tonight?
l ... am not sure.
Oliver maybe?
If my mother would have done this to me
I would take her to court.
Let us switch over now to
Max-Aurich-Institute.
My colleague Kathrin is there.
Kathrin, can you hear me?
Yes, Britta, I can hear you very well.
Professor Doctor Erlmeier, how does it look like
Can we start the race?
Yes, we are fine.
All is green to go.
Yeah, the training must have been
A real hard time.
At least what we have heard about it.
Well, yes, but nobody's really
Exhausted in the end.
You are bleeding, man!
- Ok Mareike, Gentlemen.
Oh, fuck!
This is the moment of truth.
You are excited?
- Mhm.
You are excited as well? - Yes.
- Oh, shit!
You've got to get this started now.
You will manage?
- Yes.
Yes? So I am saying now:
Mareike, please ... now!
Ready, steady, go!
May the best win!
Our candiate Mareike got her biggest
Wish come true today.
28 days, for a whole female cycle
She has been treated in one of the
Nicest Wellness spas
Swimming, eating, relaxing
The full monty!
And now Heiko, the master male
With the optimum genotype,
Will give her a perfect baby.
Did you see my pearls?
Gotta look respectable somehow.
Fuck.
They usually get their fresh editors
From evening school.
They take everyone with or without
A proper German degree
So I will get you in this fucking
Soap department, won't I?
He will find out about me in a minute.
Fuck!
Maiwald sold cars before.
He never would hire somebody
Bloody stupid.
Good evening.
Sorry!
You are Rainer Kaethner?
Yes?
You are doing ''Report 24'', right?
Yes? Do I know you?
Who let you in?
Who was that then?
No idea, some moron.
Thanks to program director
Dieter Maiwald!
The other guy making all this possible:
The man behind ''Report 24'',
''St. Pauli TV''
And the groudbreaking
''Get Ya Supa Baby''
He hit all records in july
August and september
Mr. Rainer Kaethner!
I didn't believe you would make it.
- l remember it since last year.
TTS. Reality check.
- Congrats, dear.
Life, that's entertainment,
Fun, suspense,
And sometimes simply
Distraction.
Thanks, see you later.
- Sure.
Mr Kaethner! Hello.
Nicole Neumann.
Oh, hm ... ''Julia - All for love.''
- Right.
l want to say thanks for that chance.
l love that part, maybe ...
Yeah, great format. Gotta be
A fabulous quota.
Maybe we can turn it into a TV-movie
Yes, maybe.
Rainer? What about Maiwald now?
- What about him?
Didn't we wanted to go out eating.
Fuck  Forgot something. Go ahead
I will catch up with you later, ok?
Should I tell him that I resign at
Mark & Laurens? - No, wait.
l am back in a minute, ok?
Fuck ...
l don't know where he is.
You better order now?
Joanna?
- No prob. l can wait.
No, no. We will wait.
l am a big Fan of
''Tax and Stilettos''.
This neurotic tax advisor,
Looking for Mr Right, that is ...
Simply great.
So close to reality.
Thanks.
You are making me happy.
A rockstars tax advisor.
You gotta figure that out!
The whole drama of modern women...
Well, if I would have to do a soap,
It would be just like that.
Yeah, but I am sorry.
We'll cancel it next month.
This whole ''Ally McBeal''-thing,
This is over now, I believe.
Yes, what a shame.
Heart problems.
Stay behind!
Heart attack.
Does he die?
Stay behind!
l am dying ...
- Reanimate!
Hello?
Hello!
Doc, Yes?
What's happening?
What's happening to me?
This gotta be a mistake. Please
Let me go. Please, doc!
Let me go! Let me go!
Britta, Britta, Britta.
Hello Rainer.
Don't go. Don't go.
Don't go. Help me!
Maiwald! Maiwald!
Maiwald! Maiwald, let me go!
Maiwald, please, let me go!
You are perfectly aware that
I didn't do anything, please.
What's up?
Mesdames, Messieurs
It's up to you now.
This man, who is guilty for the
Downfall of good taste
The man responsible for
the death of so many brain cells
Should this man be saved?
Does he really deserve a new start?
Consider this: He made you
Loose your brains.
It's him alone. - Not true.
You know this is not true!
l didn't do anything, only stealing
Other people's ideas.
English, Japanese, whatever.
All been done before. - Rainer!
They cannot understand you.
Make your verdict. And consider
If you press the wrong button,
It is not your fault.
Maiwald, please! Maiwald, don't go!
Anna, please! Stay here!
Come on, Rainer. Don't worry.
Wouldn't have been real
Doctors anyway?
Come on, honey.
Game over.
No!
l gotta go.
See you tomorrow, ok?
You cannot hate me more
Then I hate myself.
What are you doing around
At this time?
Here, this will help you go to sleep.
''Berlin. The swimmer coach Valeriu Tiriac
Killed himself yesterday,
After reports on TTS
Made him loose his license.
His 20-year old niece said
It is mud-slinging, all
And everything.
Actually a lot of doubts
Have been stated.
Rainer Kaethner,
Responsible for the report
Said that it's a tragic accident.
No, I simply don't want to do any
False reports no more.
Hidden cameras in a brothel.
People will watch this.
No, they are not that dumb.
We should tell stories, people
Don't know anything about,
But should know more.
You understand?
Quarter past eight.
Ok, it's a deal.
Good. We are talking about this
Tomorrow - OK.
Yes.
I want you to put it up.
And then it is over.
Thanks, good job.
See you soon, ok?
2nd time: Big!
(TV) October, 10th 1991.
Testimonials in front of
The U.S. congress
Human rights committee.
I witnessed Iracqui soldiers
Coming to the hospital.
Taking babies out of their beds and
Letting them die on the floor.
Impressive pictures. Mrs. Beham,
What can you tell us about it?
These emotional pictures
Have been broadcasted
All over America and
Finally turned around
The opinions of people
making them go to war.
And what was the point actually? -
It was a total lie.
The girl was the daughter of
The Kuwaite embassador.
And has never been in
That hospital in all of her life.
The PR-agency ''Hill & Knowton'' send her
Contracted by the american government
And she actually had been trained
For that statement.
Isn't this a bit sober?
- Did anybody report the lie?
No.
Thanks a lot, it's been an honour,
You being in our show.
Thanks a lot, I hope,
It will stay.
Wow, that's fucking brilliant...
Oh!
Well, then show me.
Don't you finally know all porn sites?
Only 5.500 homes.
Can you imagine:
There are only 5.500 homes
With a box, meassuring the quota.
That makes 13.000 people deciding,
What 80 millions gotta see in their TVs.
Only 13.000.
- So what? It's called statistics.
And none of these boxes is at a home
Of some foreigners. Not a single one.
Rainer, it's half past three.
Yes, for sure
16:30. Thanks, Lore.
Rainer!
Fucking managing board.
Want a coffee?
- No, thanks.
You, me, well ...
... I will cancel the show.
Cancel it - after one show?
Well, I don't decide this.
The quota simply was ...
... a catastrophe. - l saw the fucking quota,
And I know, it could have been better
But you oughta know
I will get this going
With my experience? - Rainer,
Please. You are in this long enough.
Our spectators are
An opportunistic bunch of people.
They don't want to feel small,
Because they don't read good books.
They wanna see tits,
And hear about tax saving tips
That's what they want.
Ok, wouldn't it be the time
For a change?
Yeah, maybe.
But it isn't our task to save them.
This is about business, Rainer.
We are here to make money.
I cannot take this anymore.
Mainstream's always gotta be shit and
Quality is only for the chosen few, right?
Fuck. Just go down and talk to people
On the street.
You will see, nobody's as dumb
As the shows we are doing.
Then who is going to buy all
That Britney-Spears-crap?
Come on, Rainer, give it up!
People just wanna buy this shit!
Yeah, and this should give us the idea
To stop doing this crap.
You are not giving your kids
Sweets all day long, do you?
Ok. Then please will you go and make a deal
With our advertising customers?
''All propaganda has to be popular
And needs to be adjusted
To the dumbest of the target audience."
You know who said that?
Adolf Hitler, 'My Struggle'.
- Oh my god, can you please stop this!
You believe in karma, Maiwald?
Rainer, please ...
All of us, here in this company,
Really pays respect to your work
But ... - l give a shit.
You need to control your drug problem.
You perfectly know...
It is only my influence...
- Your influence? - ... You should say thanks,
After your accident ... - You know what?
About your influence: You are turning
These people into zombies! You destroy
This culture, you destroy this society!
And you don't even give a damn!
What?
Look at yourself, fucker!
- Fuck you!
You have been with us
From the start, you!
Yeah ... but I'm out of this now.
You stupid, little fuck.
Code word?
- Country breakfast.
Country breakfast?
So the breast part will be...
I have to do a control visit ...
It is cancer?
To be honest, yes.
Take a cover with us
and, hm ... insect repellant.
Either I have the fat extracted
Or he leaves me.
Love handle that is ...
Look at you, fat bitch!
You are way too fat, who wants ...
''The Titanic Show''.
100 candidates, one ship.
Who is going to survive?
The rich on top of the world
Or the poor guys down below?
Watch the action,
Survival of the fittest.
Pure romance.
Big Brother, that was yesterday
Here comes ...
What's this?
I cancelled my contract.
So if the quota doesn't work
If nobody watches this shit,
All is well?
Problem is, one day they will see it
Anyway.
People getting used to dirt
Want the dirt all the time.
The morals of people have been
Corrupted so systematically
So everybody thinks it is normal
If there is only trash and tits
And talk shows.
It is a perfect system, Anna.
But not much longer...
The fucking quota is the weak spot
And that is exactly where I will attack.
No, the whole principle is madness.
Just think: Somebody watching
For five hours a day, there's no other
Choice but going mad.
And now you look at this:
These guys watching for five hours.
These guys actually have five times
More influence on the fucking quota
... ok, but do you know anybody,
With one of these boxes at home?
You see, this is it: I don't even know
Anybody who knows anybody,
With such a box and I am
Working in TV since years and years.
What I am saying is this: All people
Who don't pay their TV fees
Have no influence here at all.
And that is 20% of all Germans.
So all the  jobless people,
all students
Are not included in these statistics, right?
So my producer gives me a call
And says, your movie doesn't show
There was an interruption.
- What, ''interruption''?
Some kind of technical interruption.
TV test pattern. - TV test pattern?
All the way TV test pattern. But the
Following day the stats say,
200.000 watched it.
Surprising how many fans
for the TV test pattern.
Sorry.
No need for sorry.
I don't deserve anything else.
Wait a moment! Listen. Please.
Just a minute.
Your grandpa ...
I am really sorry.
I feel awfully sorry.
But we can do something now.
No more fucking fake reports.
Say, what's your name again?
Pegah.
Pegah? Like that flying horse?
Rainer?
Yes?
- Good morning.
Morning. - Do you have a room?
Room? l do not rent no more
Since quite a while.
Well, get in. Maybe I've got an idea.
19 and 20.
- Thanks a lot.
Hello, one time please.
Five Euro.
We are generating the quota
and this is the daily measurement,
Of all that is shown on TV.
Look here, this is the lMA-Meter,
The power over the whole country.
As you can see, it is switched
To the TV-set.
And it has an individual remote control.
All family members have their
Respective button.
Papa button 1,
Mama button 2,
Son button 3. And even a button
for guests in the house.
This means: Everybody who
Wants to watch TV
First has to register here.
On top of the monitor you can see
The live quota.
Well, I am Mama now.
I press button number 2.
As you can see here, the quota
for ''Dr. Sommerfeld''
Just moved higher by a number
of 15.000 spectators.
This means, one single unit
Represents 15.000 spectators?
Exactly. - Isn't this a bit much?
Are the families getting paid?
No. All for the country.
Please follow me.
Black trousers, brown shirt.
Yes, I am watching.
Hey!
Hey! Stop!
Pegah, go! Go!
- Stop! Don't move!
This is 20.000 Volt. Understand?
- Ok.
Calm down.
- l am calm.
What is this? Get it out.
Unpack this.
Put it down.
- l didn't steal this.
Borrowed it, right? - No.
You have no clue what's going on here.
This is a major conspiracy.
And you have no idea.
This is for good. The whole world
Will drown in shit.
Do you know that? All because of
Fucking idiots like you
You are the idiot here!
l am calling control.
And they will pick you up here, you will see. -
Phillip, look at me.
Where have you got my name from?
- It is on this plate.
We are no criminals and you are
Not one of them, I can see this.
You can make this call now
And it will all go down the drain.
It is like in ''Brave New World'',
Only worse.
''Brave New World'', yeah?
What is that island called?
''Paradise''.
The first imprint?
- 1932, english version.
Shit, Man.
And what is your purpose?
Give me five minutes and I will explain it all.
Only five minutes.
l  swear to god. Please.
Get in.
Phillip.
Go!
- Fuck!
Fuck.
- Control here for Phillip, please copy.
Yes, this is Phillip ...
l am afraid I lost him
Ok, then please come back to control.
- What? Hello, I can't hear you.
l think my battery is down...
This thing is.
Fucking place.
Yes, turn right here. And there
You have to turn left again, yes.
We are going to my place.
That's ok, isn't it?
''Brave New World'', You are saying?
That's my favourite.
You are living here?
- Yes.
Nice area.
Are you sure?
Come in.
You are reading a lot?
- Yes ...
Sit down.
Well ...
Drinks?
Love to.
- What? Beer?
And you?
- Beer as well.
Ok.
l have only begun ...
No. Get out of there.
No, here ... my side.
Sort of an alarm.
Light sensors.
Works this way ...
Sit down.
No, no, here. This is my place.
Well, now assuming the quotas
Being manipulated for real,
The advertisers put their spots
In all the wrong places.
Forget these spots.
That's peanuts.
You have to see the big picture,
Understand? it is like this:
The fucking quota only allows
Programs, which make you think,
Buying things will make you happy.
This way they make you buy more things.
I have considered that before.
They want to divide us.
And the politicians
Work together with them.
In the end you have a small elite
With access to knowledge.
And power. And the rest.
The big fat masses
Will be kept stupid.
And then they will tell you,
The jews are responsible for all
And that we have to invade Iracq
And Vietnam,
Colonel Kurtz, Pope John, the first.,
Massacre in Armenia,
Munich, Dostojewski.
Good.
And what is your plan?
Well, first of all, we thought we get a box
And have a look inside, the cables and...
There are cables inside.
- Really?
Yes. - But what's really important ...
Is addresses.
We need the addresses of all people,
With such boxes at home,
Then we can check, wether the quota
Is real. Also I know,
Your company has the best security system
Maybe the best in the world ...
Yes, yes ...
Quite massive, yes.
But this doesn't mean ...
There is no way around it.
l was in there once before.
- What?
You have the addresses? - Yes,
I haven't got'em here, but ...
Wait a moment. So you are working
On the same project, right?
You want the same thing we want?
- Don't know. Maybe a little.
Awesome! So ...
We get together!
We are in the same team together, right?
Ok? Yes, we are!
You, me, Pegah!
We are a team, man!
And then we fuck these fuckers real hard!
Yes, ok.
One team!
OK?
Yes, we are, sure.
l have to see the loo.
Phillip?
Phillip, are you ok?
Phillip, are you ok?
What is he doing?
Phillip!
- What?
Are you ok in there?
- Well, yeah ...
You gotta go now, ok?
Let's go.
Look: If I have been a bit wild,
I am sorry, ok?
I am sorry. - You have to go now!
Phillip, you have no idea,
How important these addresses.
Do me a favour, please ...
- You have to go now. You ...
Phillip, it's ok. - We are gone in a minute.
Just the addresses and we are off.
My grandma is here soon.
- Here is the idea ... Wait a second!
You get 500 Euro if you give me
The fucking addresses.
My grandma's got money too. - What's
You grandma gotta do with this, fuck?
l give you 1.000 Euro,
Damn it, man!
Get out of here!
Social phobia? My whole fucking life
Is a fucking social phobia.
Which life?
And how did your parents die?
Car accident. Instantly dead.
Shit. I am sorry.
lt's ok.
Grew up with my grand dad.
Perfectly ok.
Only your grand dad? Nobody else?
Phillip?
Hello.
Hi.
- Come in.
Well, I have got ...
The list.
The addresses?
- Yes, this is the list with all the addresses.
Wow. How fucking great!
Does this mean ... -
Yeah, I am with you.
Sorry, that I  ...
Overreacted a bit, at home, at my place.
No problem. - l don't know you,
You know? You never know.
l ... you know and ...
And then, I saw that movie,
WIth this guy who reported it all in the end.
But you seem to be clean.
So, this is all over Germany.
Helgoland, Sylt ...
Sometimes it is cheaper,
To go by railway ...
Phillip? - And the cheap airlines these days ...
- You want a beer?
Yes, please. And maybe we should do
A few more copies of this ...
Cheers.
- Cheers.
Look here, the red dots
Are all over Germany.
Tonight we will have the proof:
Nobody's watching this shit.
On we go!
Biller. - Hello, Mrs Biller.
This is Lenz. I am calling from the lMA.
Gunther, polling institute Emrit.
Would you be so kind to answer a few questions?
Could you please switch on your TV set?
Good. And could you please switch over
To Arte now for the moment?
Good, thanks a lot, Mr Leonhard.
Good Bye.
Shit.
There is an electrical diffusion
From your TV set.
Scientists found out now
This could be the reason for cancer.
Could you please switch over to TTS?
Ok, thanks.
Thanks a lot and good bye.
Shit ...
Gerold.
l have no idea, what you are talking about.
What sort of quotas?
Hmmm ... Boxes, which meassure the quotas
For German TV stations.
You are sure?
- Yes. You are here on our list.
Hello, Mrs Frank, this is Lenz
From the lMA. May I ask,
Wether you watch TV right now? -
Yes. ''Call-in Show'' Cable 4.
Ok. Could you please switch over,
Five seconds only.
Good, ok. Thank you.
Yes, exactly.
Switch it over shortly.
Why? You can switch back afterwards.
That's no problem. With such a concert
You don't miss that much, do you?
And why is that? Because you are too
Stupid to find the button, or what?
Still can be coincidence
That we only get the ones,
Who are not manipulated.
And, hm ... because they are simply ...
Bullshit, the fucking quota is right, man!
Exactly right, precisely fucking right.
l have to go for a piss, ok?
- Ok.
Just shortly.
15.
Where was I at 15 ...
Rainer?
- Rainer!
You can not stay overnight.
- I am ok. I am ok.
Come.
- You are fine? Rainer?
We have heard it, Rainer. Yes,
We have heard it.
Shit!
Attention.
God is speaking hebrew.
That's it then.
We only found proof that
The quota is technically right.
There is enough possibilities for manipulation
Left in the selection of the families.
They are getting politically checked,
For their will to consume ...
I have seen the questionnaire,
Rainer. - Come on, Phillip, fuck it!
Who wants to be saved?
You know what?
We should get a couple of all animals
Build a big ship
And wait.
The Arch.
- Noah.
No, we do something different.
We exchange the boxes and
Manipulate the quotas ourselves.
We have to get 5.000 boxes,
Install GSM mobile transmitters
And exchange the boxes.
The boxes wouldn't react on the signal
From the remote control any longer,
We could control it
With mobile phones.
Technically doable,
But the logistics...
Why? We don't have to replace 5.000 boxes
1.000 are totally sufficient.
This would allow enough control on the quota. -
She is right, no?
Nevertheless you need to rob a bank first.
That's no problem.
I could sell my flat.
Sell it all.
Mr Kaethner has no right to sell
My things! And I will take you to court
Because of burglary and if you not let me down
Assault will get on top of this!
I could get rid of my little one.
And who is going to go into people's homes
To exchange a 1.000 boxes?
Five million people jobless?
Sorry, just a quick question:
You want a job?
Sure. - Something with
Telecommunication.
However this is sheer madness.
1.000 boxes!
The logistics alone. Let's say
We would have five workers
Installing four boxes a day each.
We still need ...
... two months. - Look, that's not that bad.
Each day a few households
Would add to the changing quota.
Not a dramatic change.
Much less visible by control.
- She is right.
Next one, please.
Hi.
You are psychotherapist?
No, would like to be one.
Fucking handwriting, right? - Yes.
No, pyrotechnician. What exactly
Do I get for this. In cash, I mean?
Well we...
We thought of ...
... 1.900 Euro after tax?
Oh ... Wow! Oh!
l am your man!
You know computers?
- l have send an email once.
They caught me at the airport
Twelve years for two times
Bankrobbery.
And it was only plastic weapons.
Shit.
You are out on probation now?
- Hm, half a year.
ls this a problem?
- No, not at all.
Namaste. Namaste.
Good, Mister ...
Gopal Tscharan. Gopal Tscharan.
Good, Mister Shrin. Then, hmm ... tell us
Something about yourself.
I am from Hadravat in lndia.
Been living there.
Have been building airplane parts.
Five long years, machinery
Machinery, machinery.
Enough of machinery. And then I
Met this German woman.
And she told me to come to Germany.
1961 I came to Germany
Been working 20 years for Mercedes Benz
In Stuttgart
Machinery, machinery, machinery.
Enough of machinery.
I said: ''What should I do?''
l went to Berlin and started
To do pantomime.
Pantomime, Pantomime, Pantomime.
Me quiet, me quiet, me quiet.
Enough of me quiet
What should I do?
In the meantime me meet
Other woman.
Told me to come to Maibach.
Ok. - Small job, little one,
If you want to give me? Yes?
Well... You know computers
Technical things?
Computers?
I am a machine man.
You show me little Computer,
I make Computer for you.
I am working for telephone help line
One-Euro-Job.
But actually I would like to do something
More meaningful. You have been talking
About a project which makes people
Grow intellectually?
Well, yeah, it is about
Intellectual freedom, sort of.
Yeah, great!
- What kind of music are you listening to?
Oldies, Deejayed a little
Way back then in a youth club.
Have to say, sometimes I like to
Turn the volume up, yeah.
Bernd, you did telecommunication
Once, didn't you?
Yes, I've been learning at the German Telekom
Communications engineering.
And afterwards I was in the field service team.
Until 1996. They fired me back then.
And where do you live now?
- You met me there.
At the petrol station?
- Yes.
Hmm ... Bernd, sorry for asking,
Maybe a bit embarrassing,
But I have to ask you:
You have a drinking problem, don't you?
Not at all bad, no. Don't worry.
It is no problem for us, I only
Need to know wether you are able
To work. Are you ok with that?
Yes, got it under control, really
- Ok.
Bernd, you have the job.
And where are they supposed to live?
ln a container?
No, why? They can stay here in the pension.
Nobody else is living here.
No, that is ...
Look, that is not possible.
Now this is a nice house you have got here!
Beer?
We need a control center
You understand?
Not at my place.
Good.
Hey man, get down!
Are you crazy?
Hey man, this is no problem.
And then we need a gripper
To strip the coax-insulation.
Five times. - Everyone of the working guys
Needs a car of his own,
And ... equipment, mobile phones.
And finally where do you want
To get the 1.000 Boxen?
No problem. Been researching:
These boxes can be ordered
In Switzerland. A little bit of money
But not too much.
Here is the box, Phillip!
What are they doing?
- Would like to know.
Well, let's give it a try
So we will do it.
- Yes, ok, let's try it.
Ok, our mastermind Phillip here
Has developed a plan,
Allowing us to reach all of these targets
Within two months.
Two months? That would make it
4.16 boxes...
... a day for each of us.
Good mental arithmetic, Karl-Heinz,
Not bad but let's say, five a day.
That's easier, so are we ok
With five a day, yes?
Ok, then. Your employee ...
... is called lMA.
''lnstitute for media analysis''.
Get this into your heads.
Very important. Ok?
You visit people and tell them
You are installing the latest version
Of the quota box.
- How is this going to work, technically?
Phillip will tell you this in a minute. Ok?
If some guys want to know more
Or if there are any questions, you tell them
To call this emergency number.
This is important. The new emergency number
Is one page number one of your info folder, ok?
This is extremely important because if people
Call the real lMA, then we
Have a problem.
Do you understand? - Yes.
Gopal? Good.
Keyword under class television.
- Under class? Am I under class?
No, that is just like in India,
Simply the lowest class.
Boys!
- Ok?
This is what we are fighting for. Ok?
Now you are able to fuck these fuckers
Who make you feel like shit and who
Do everything to make you stay that way
To fuck them really hard.
- Nice thing!
This is it, right?
And this is the key to it all.
Cables counted?
- Yes, yes, yes.
''So let the earth grow
Grass and herbs
Let it grow
And be fruitful''
ls a great thing, right?
- Yes.
I am always so enthusiastic, you know what?
You can keep this.
l promise you will find advise
For whatever problem you may have.
And lots of good luck with the garden.
Thank you.
- Have a nice day. - Yes, and you.
Benni, put that thing back in again,
Or I have to beat you!
This is all possible because we
Have no death penalty.
My husband's saying the same thing.
Our German laws are simply too weak.
They should make Guenther Jauch
Rule the country.
He would know what to do.
- Yes, you might be right with that.
Sorry, I will put it all back in place.
Sorry, all back in order, ok?
No problem.
A little to the left
- Wonderful, Dieter.
What is this then?
Ouch!
Ouch, this hurts.
I am saying, ribs, Dieter. The ribs ...
Have to call emergency.
(Pegah) No.
We take over any damages.
Oh yes, of course the assurance
Will cover this.
Sure, furniture will be covered as well.
Exactly, don't worry. Ok.
Good, talk to you soon.
Thank you.
Harry slipped on a curtain.
He is not coming in again today. - What?
He had to go into hospital.
Didn't understand it all.
And how about you?
- How about it?
Fucking shit!
- I, hm ...
Don't know, must have mixed up some cables. -
Mixed up the cables?
Karl-Heinz, please!
Mixed up the cables?
Short cut, ok? Open fire.
Half the house burnt down.
l thought you are the electrician? -
Yes, I am sorry ...
l am no electrician.
l ... I lied to you.
I see.
Great! Well done!
Yes, but I needed that job. - And you have
To lie to me for that?
Well, have you got a clue,
How's that, jobless, no money?
Tell me,
What if we all have to go to prison?
And all this for some people
Who don't want to be saved at all?
This is not going to happen
Why are you not being able to sleep then?
I can't sleep since a long time.
Guggenheim has donated something?
Why haven't you been there?
Sorry, I  ... excuse me,
I'll call you back later?
Talk to you then, ciao.
Hello.
- Finished, So now I have to ...
Why's that? Excuse me!
- Yes, I have other customers as well.
Why don't you stay a little longer.
What's your name? ''Juergen''.
l've got a good glass of Whiskey, Juergen.
You have to ... - Sorry, gotta drive.
Come on, that's no problem.
l've got a chauffeur.
But my car is here.
- So what?
Cheers! On us!
In all countries on earth
The working class rules
Cologne is in strike
And Cuba is doing the work
Moscow is making the weather
And Beijing is doing the reform.
l am sleeping now.
- What? You cannot go to sleep now!
Sorry, I am so tired. -
And what about your chauffeur?
Good morning.
- Hello.
You are Mr Kaethner?
- Yes, what is the problem?
The problem is back there.
What has he done? - Mr Bauer
Drove into a bus stop.
That is an assurance case, isn't it? -
Not with so much alcohol.
Additionally I have to mention he is
A troublemaker. And Mr Bauer
Has no place to stay, that's why
We have to arrest him.
If he cannot pay for the damage, that is.
And how much would that be? - 50.000 Euro.
- 50.000 Euro for a bus stop?
That thing cost 100.000 and that's
Only the repair cost.
In the end it can get more expensive
Or cheaper as well.
I cannot pay this anyway.
Take him with you.
Rainer, what's up?
Something wrong here.
l am hungry.
He can't do this, really.
Wow. I am gone. I am out of this.
- Shit.
Let him do it by himself.
Fuck revolution.
How can he be that stupid?
You know what this means?
I am finished. I am dead!
This is a fucking mess.
We never should have started this
With these bums. Never!
Where is everybody?
Time was 8 o'clock for the meeting.
Nobody will come. Not any more.
- I see. And why?
Why's that...
Because you let Bernd down!
l didn't do that. There is exactly
50.000 Euro in this suitcase.
If I spend this right now,
It's all over.
Bernd is our buddy
And he trusted you.
Bernd did a Job,
And I paid him for.
''Me, myself and I''!
Who do you think you are?
You have the money, get some guys,
Have them go to jail for you
And turn around like nothing?
This is a human being?
He is in prison now! - Pegah, please.
And if that has happened to me,
Would you act the same?
But you are not like that.
Bernd is.
l will not pay this, forget it.
Ok. Then I am gone.
Pegah!
Pegah!
Pegah, wait a minute!
Maybe you are not completely wrong.
Maybe you are right
But please,
Don't go now and
Leave me alone with this.
Look, I know I can be such an asshole.
I know that!
I don't know why!
It's just a feeling that
If I am not like that ...
The only guys who help you now
Are different from the rest,
Not like the others.
Guys who still feel something.
And that's why they don't get along
In this fucking world!
But you don't fucking care!
You know you need them
But you cannot accept the way the are.
Sometimes I think,
If we should ever win this war
All stays the same - just like before
Only you are the boss then.
Just fuck off.
Ten.
Twenty.
Thirty.
Forty. Fifty.
Second door to the left, in the yard,
You can pick him up there.
Ok.
Yes? - This is Harry.
Karl-Heinz, is this you?
Ja. - Bernd is out!
- What? Since when?
This morning. Let's meet later. -
Ok, I am coming.
l don't believe this!
Hey, this is impossible!
Unbelievable!
Sober again, no?
It's good to have you back
Hello there, stupid.
- Just like you.
So, did you have a nice time? -
You have to tell us all!
Come on.
It's over.
l haven't got any money left.
l cannot pay you any longer.
Rainer, we have thought about this.
We go on without getting paid.
But we don't go into the houses any longer.
- The data,
All the date gets forwarded to IMA
Through the telephone line, right?
So we hook on right there.
No need to go into the houses.
Oh yes, really?
How's this going to work out then?
All houses have a general connection
That's where we connect, there is a code involved
Some new system from Switzerland
But Kalle can help us with that
And then we can make 7 or 8 a day.
Rainer, now watch this.
Simply some sort of rerouting
From the individual boxes
Right back to us here.
And then back there again.
Only we manipulate the files
Before we send them back.
And then the IMA gets all the
Manipulated files instead of the real ones.
And they have no chance to find out.
It's only a delay of five milliseconds.
Well, then ... Let's get going.
Yeah!
- Right!
I'd knew it!
Bravo!
Don't get tired.
- We will make it. - You bet.
Ciao!
- See you later!
Hare Krishna!
You got petrol? - Yes.
- And, did you pay?
No. - Why not?
- The queue was too long.
Well then just wait in queue.
- There was one already.
Liberated households
Liberated households
1, 2, 3 ... and counting...
Cheers!
So ...
Dear friends!
Gentlemen.
I have to tell you this:
Today at 14:36
Central european time
Our computers capitulated.
Oh!
- Fucking shit!
There was a specific reason:
To work for us totally.
Yeah!
- Wow!
Cheers to mother.
- Why mother?
It's the alien!
Computers.
The bonus will be raised today.
Now it is one beer each connection.
Yeah!
- Beer! A beer!
Well done, old man!
- Cheers!
No more fucking around.
Your breath moves in waves
Like the ocean.
Your eyes gettign tired.
You close your eyes.
Imagine a green meadow.
There is a lake now.
You jump into that lake ...
No. no.
- What do you mean, no?
l cannot swim.
(Bernd) Ok? - (Phillip) Stop it. No,
A little bit to the back.
Yes.
Yeah, this is ok now.
- Ok, fine with me now.
Ok.
Wait a moment, it moved,
Go on a little, 10 degrees westward.
So this is the real time quota.
With 500 boxes we can manipulate
One channel only, so far.
No further than that.
Do it then!
- Thry that one! - Ok.
Which one should we use?
- Which one's got the highest quota?
Here, this is TTS. - And what's on there?
- ''My new dream body''.
Oh my god, isn't that that shit,
With the beauty operations?
Fuck. Fat drainage ...
Disgusting!
Alright, let's do it on TTS, ok?
Do you mind, Rainer?
- Absolutely not.
Ok.
One Moment.
Nothing happening.
Now.
- Doesn't move. - It is.
It moved
- No, no, no.
Of course, see!
There! You see!
It's moving!
But we need another 1.000 boxes.
We need another 1.000.
No problem, Phillip.
- Not a big deal!
But that's the minimum, 1.000.
- You are a genius, Phillip.
Fucking great!
See you later, boys!
Look at this!
There is the seaside!
Hold it! Hold it!
Gentlemen, five boxes
That adds up to five bottle of beer
l'll do another one.
- One for me. - One more beer.
l am going down! l am going down!
Mr Gruendgens, do you want to comment
On the TTS quota crisis?
Crisis? What crisis? - The latest
Figures have been really bad!
We are stll leading the market.
Not like your fucking channel.
Bitch.
Maiwald, I want to see you
In my office within 20 minutes.
I don't give a shit.
Within 20 minutes.
Look, Maiwald. I don't care
How you move up the quota,
Just do it.
The customers want better content.
Thank you, thanks a lot.
Ok.
- You are ok? - Yes.
Look, this is always the same:
We once had a soap on air.
A typical soap: fucking bad actors,
Story totally predictable
Cheapest of the cheap.
The quota was terrible.
People said: What a stupid, fucking shit?'
But we went on with the show.
Day in, day out. No mery at all.
For six months. After three months
The quota started to get better.
After five months even better. And
After six months people loved it.
But why's that?
- They simply got used to it.
Understand? Adaption.
Adaption is the biggest power on earth.
You show them this shit for so long
Until they don't want to see anything else.
And now we simply turn this around:
We show them good things for so long,
Until they are adapted to it.
- And you believe this could work?
Sure! Look out, I have been working
On something, sort of a concept.
Shit.
(Phillip) Look ... Pegah, I've got a
Documentation here about ancient Egypt.
You like this?
- Guess this will be good for 7,03 percent.
Yeah. Cool.
Another thing, somehow ...
Ouch, 0,0 percent for
''Germany is looking for the superstar''.
Yeah ...
Kill them all!
''Angst essen Seele auf' (Fear Eats the Soul)
What's that then?
Early film by Fassbinder.
Thumbs up! Thumbs up, Phillip!
That's a teaching profession?
- No, a great director, trust me.
Fassbeer?
- No, Fassbinder. The director.
Hmm, Beer!
Gopal, you are the greatest!
Men hunters in lndia!
- Men hunters in lndia, Phillip!
Men hunters in lndia!
- lndia, that's downhill Himalaja.
Yeah.
Yeah, ok. Good.
Look at this: Euro sport, they show
''American Choppers''. - What's that?
Customizing cars, real big cars.
Something for people into cars, bikes and stuff.
Here ... this is Kl.KA! (children channel)
That's ... ''Wicki and the strong guys''!
Hey, Wicki! Hey, Wicki!
Tie it up! Tie it up!!
What's the name of the captain again?
- Halva! - Halva's his name!
TV has changed a lot lately,
Some of my friends don't even
Switch it on any longer
Others changes their appointments
All the time because some
Terrible exciting documentation
Is on cable one. So I guess it's time
To ask you guys!
This is Mrs. Hagen.
Mrs. Hagen, do you like the new
TV programs? - Yes, it's simply awesome.
l think it is very interesting. They
Should go on with this.
I think it's fucking load of shit.
Hardly watch anything.
Me too. Yesterday I switched it on
And guess what?
Only stupid black and white movies.
I think the changes in TV programs
Is an excellent opportunity.
Earlier on we took it all as truth
And then we found out that
It is only garbage.
And nowadays the stuff we watch,
Is all about our own reality.
Many people like the changes
In TV programs.
This is a great thing: People
Are starting to think again.
Damn it, why the fuck I haven't got
At least 20 new scripts
Waiting for me on my desk?
All I got are some fucking musicals.
''Medley, a musical show''.
Are you mad? Thinking a musical
Has something to do with culture.
Didn't you say, we should take it easy?
But not for the whole of three days, asshole!
Out there, people are going crazy.
God knows why.
Did anybody, anyone of you
Think about our current status,
Our performance?
Sure the quota went down lately,
But what exactly are we supposed to do?
Something intelligent,
Something clever damn it!
You went to university, didn't you!
Morons! You heard it!
Buddhismus, Friedrich Nietzsche
Comparative studies, what the fuck?
Just gimme somebody who hasn't
Been drugged since ten years.
That's why I want to say,
We should be very determined
This so called "Intellectual Awakening"
Is only weaking our already
Slow growth of economy.
Of course it is a positive trend,
Our children will be comparatively
Better in school.
But what is the price for this!
Consumer electronics
The computer game industry,
A foremost growing sector
Now fell back of over a third
In overall turnaround
What, I am asking myself,
What else is going to happen,
Until we wake up?
Thank you very much. Thanks a lot.
Mrs Moll is here.
Let her in.
Anna! How are you doing?
You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.
It's a real pity that we don't have
The time to meet more often.
Come on. Let's sit down.
Now tell me, how's everything?
Great! Our new format about literature,
simply great. - Sorry? Which one?
''Hit and Read''. We have VIPs
Throw darts at book covers.
And whatever they catch, that's
Going to be read. Great idea.
Sounds brilliant! You want a drink?
- No, thanks.
And what's Rainer doing?
Have you heard anything?
No, quite a while since the last time.
Why are you asking?
Oh, nothing specific.
Well, he was a .. was a friend, right?
He was very much into this whole
Quota thing before he dissapeared.
Do you know anything?
I call you because you ...
You have that system,
To locate mobile phones.
Cheers!
To Pegah, guys!
Hey.
Ok.
Slowly. Ok, ok, ok. You go first.
Carefull, there's a small step coming.
Two ...
And ... Three.
Yeah!
We are in Berlin now,
Warsaw bridge, let's see,
What this naughty one has to say
About our new television.
I noticed this: Yesterday I saw this
lnterview, well sort of a discussion
Running much longer than usual.
Well, I liked it.
Can you give me a real good applause?
Please!
That's it then.
Televison has the tendency
To replicate reality now,
To be a picture of reality.
This is the original use of media:
Mediate and moderate.
Thus we are set free.
We can breathe
And live our lives.
A few months ago I watched TV
At this time of the day
And today I am going out for
A walk along the river.
Fuck the quota!
Fuck the quota!
Hello?
Hello!
Yes?
l take care about this
Rainer!
Long time no see!
You look good.
Five years younger.
No anger?
What do you want?
Let me say one thing: Respect
Rainer. Great system!
Really, what you have done here,
I wouldn't have thought you are able to.
I have to warn you, don't mix with this.
- Cool down, Rainer, cool down.
One call and all of you
Go to prison. Understand?
Oh my god, Rainer!
Was it worth all this?
Well, I ...
I mean was it really worth
Throwing away a career.
What for? Only to proof that TV is dumb?
Something really new.
Look, twenty years ago:
People got upset
About the dying forests.
They went on street for peace in Vietnam.
These days it is all about
Brad Pitt and Paris Hilton.
And you know what?
They don't miss anything.
You started a ...
... Trend. - Yes, so what?
People chatted a little about books
Like they did about TV before.
But do you honestly believe
This changes anything?
Maiwald.
- Who is Maiwald?
That's his car, isn't it?
I burn it down!
Harry, stop it! Calm down ...
The old food chain, Rainer.
The whole shit about the 60ies,
Almost ruined us.
There can only be one on top of the stairs.
The rest has to be kept busy.
And that's not so simple.
Television gave us stability.
The best system we ever had so far.
People stay at home
And don't get into any stupid ideas.
We don't fuck up the world, Rainer.
We are the good boys, we do good things.
You fucking fascist.
This is stupid.
Bollocks, Rainer.
Plain bollocks.
There is no difference left among
The state and the media
Religion, politics, science
Economy, all one big machine
For the sake of humanity.
People have work and all what is left
Is here in this box.
You better get out of here
Or I I forget myself!
Do you really believe,
I'll let you ruin my career?
This is the deal: You go on
With whatever you want to do here,
Only the TTS-quota gets up by 10 percent
Within the next twenty days.
And I will finance all of this.
100.000 Euro for each percent.
You start right now or I report you
Right away. You choose.
Oh, by the way!
Greeting from Anna.
She is doing very well.
Good morning!
I vote for going on.
Let's give him his fucking quota.
I don't trust him.
There's something fishy.
He will report us as soon as
He's the boss over there.
True. We should not give in to this asshole.
I don't think so.
If we would do this now,
He is in it just the same.
We can proof it all.
Hey guys, quality and trash-TV
How is this going together?
We are betraying our own ideas.
But we need the cash.
One million, guys, one million!
New cars! Computers!
Money is the end of any revolution.
Same story always.
Good morning, Lore.
- Morning, Boss.
How was the weekend?
- Well ... Good! And you?
Wonderful, really wonderful!
My boat has got a new engine,
And now its fast as hell.
Really brilliant.
So these are the weekend's quotas?
So bad?
Please connect me to the
Minister of the interior. - Yes.
Oh, and Mr Gruendgens
Wants to talk to you.
I was expecting that.
Tell our chairman, I will meet him
At half past nine.
Please don't disturb me until then.
Close the door! - Yes.
Maiwald, I am sorry,
You know how things work.
The quota is a sheer catastrophe
Since months.
Things are not what they look like.
Rainer Kaethner,
You remember the name?
He ... is leading a group of saboteurs.
They manipulate the quota.
Sorry! - I don't know, how they do it.
Whatever.
Maiwald!
Brace yourself.
We are not in one of your shows.
Take it as a man.
You haven't made the change
And it is on me now
To make a decision.
And I will not sacrifice myself.
You know how things are.
Maiwald.
The compensation will allow
You a proper new start.
Didn't you have that boat?
What was the name?
''Lissy''?
Go and have a nice holiday trip
You look like you need it.
''Lucy''.
- Maiwald!
The boat is called ''Lucy'',
Fucking asshole!
I will tell them all
And you can go cleaning the toilets then.
Corrupt pig.
Fucking asshole.
Go.
Morning!
Coffee anybody?
Double or two single ones?
It's all empty upstairs.
All empty.
What do you mean, ''All empty''?
We have to be out of here in two days
My uncle is coming back.
I can take two guys to stay in my bus.
Not important. Point is, we have to get
The system back running again.
Phillip, we have to work on the system.
Get it back working.
They discovered this long ago. -
We cannot stop now.
We haven't done it long enough.
- They find out within three minutes.
And that's it then. All over.
At least we tried.
And what did we try to achieve?
Totally useless action.
Like warming up a whole winter city
With one single radiant heater.
Totally fucked up.
What have you got there?
Todays?
- Yes.
Phillip, look at this. - What is it?
- This is from today.
Here.
Impossible.
Todays? - Yes.
Holy shit!
- This can't be true!
18,7 percent! - That's the shit,
You wanted to see!
Yes, that's it!
You can watch it by yourself!
What's going on? - People still
Watch the quality stuff,
Despite we stopped manipulating
The quota a week ago.
Oh really!
Damn it, we did it!
Shit, man, I knew this,
People aren't that stupid!
I knew it!
Look at this, old man!
Rainer, what are you saying?
We should go on, right? - Yes.
Hassloch.
Hassloch!
Hassloch?
A small village in the south
With a typical average and
Representative profile.
People buy all things with a chip card.
All things going to be sold in Germany
Will be tested in Hassloch first. Get the idea?
Here it will be decided what is
Going to be produced and sold in the future.
Harry, how much is this?
1,39 Euro, Gopal.
- Thanks.
4,95, please.
Thanks.
That's 7,80 all together. And the bottle
Is on the house. I am the house.
35,95, please.
- I only got 20.
Whatever. Take it.
But I need your chip card before you go.
