Claudia: I feel confused,
change my mind every two seconds.
I do not know what to think.
Some days I decide

Then already in the elevator I think:
If when I open the door ...
... I smiles and embraces me,
do not leave again .
Then he smiles you do not
and you do not like it, right?
What then if the problem was only...
you are missing some attention,
sentirsi courted...

I can complain? I am missing?
Maybe I'm becoming
one of those horrible people...
speaking only for themselves,
of their problems...
You know, see things too closely
and lose sight of.
According to me I should start
to care more than others.
Do volunteer work,
things like that, because...
Why is that face?
Is that what this
I have heard many times:
Solve the problems of someone else
and solve your own.
Looking at things from a certain
distance, giving it the proper weight...
Do not believe it.

Which bastard?
Why do not you say anything

He took the keys.
Maybe they were the keys to the attic.
Well, yes, maybe now

But no, it's impossible.
We do not have the loft.
That is, we have, but the keys
