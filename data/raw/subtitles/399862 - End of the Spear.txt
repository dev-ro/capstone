Some people say we live
in a world of irreconcilable differences.
Others say a true peace-
lasting peace-
can't be obtained because
we haven't found a way yet...
to change the human heart.
I took a journey once with a warrior
named Mincayani...
down a remote river deep
in the Amazon basin of Ecuador.
The events of thatjourney will
challenge what a lot of people say.
To understand what brought us
to the river on that day...
you need to know about Mincayani
and his people...
the Waodani.
You see, our story was set in motion
before I was even born.
Mincayani was just a boy.
1943
Amazon Basin, Ecuador
Mincayani had grown up
in the rain forest...
living the same way the Waodani people
had lived since the beginning of time.
The fierceness of the Waodani
tribe was legendary.
More than half of all the Waodani
died from the spears of other Waodani...
and the cycle
of revenge-spearing...
had brought them to
the brink of extinction.
Moipa!
Father!
Get Gimade!
Dayumae!
Dayumae.!
You went back
for the stupid bird?
I went back to
put Nemo in the earth...
so her spirit won't wander.
Now I follow
my father's carvings.
Father.! Father.!
I was so afraid you were dead.
Where is Nemo?
Mincayani went back for the bird.
Dayumae went back for the stupid bird.
I say we eat him.
There is no food in this place.
If you die, I'll strangle her...
and put her
in the earth with you.
Do you want me
in the earth with you?
Mincayani, come here.
Take Dayumae into the forest.
Don't let her mother find her.
Are you leaving us?
I mustjump the Great Boa.
Next full moon, we'll go back.
I'll never go back.
- No, Dayumae. They'll kill you.
- I'm dead if I stay.
- They'll eat your flesh.
- Then I'll join my father.
Watch out! Shoot!
Shoot.!
I've only one bullet!
There are others!
1956 Shell Mera, Ecuador
Ever since I was a boy...
I loved making
things with my hands.
Mom and Aunt Rachel said that Dad and I
were very much alike that way.
I was eight years old
when we made a model plane together.
That was the time when Dad
was first looking for the Waodani.
I had heard the violent stories
of the Waodani.
Everyone near thejungle did.
Dad said he saw their violence
as a trap...
like a prison that they couldn't
escape from on their own.
He would make flights
as often as he could...
try to find one of their
small villages.
That was the only time
I was afraid when he was flying.
I'm guessing Mincayani must have been
around 20 years old...
when he first saw my father's plane.
It's a guess because the Waodani
don't mark time.
To this day, Mincayani
doesn't know his actual age.
Mincayani,
we need wives to make our drink.
We say take them
from the Aenomenani.
What do you say?
I say a jaguar ate this monkey.
Maybe the monkey ate himself.
He thinks the Aenomenani
sent a jaguar spirit.
I will spear this jaguar.
We need women, not jaguar.
We should hunt monkeys
or wild pigs.
At least something we can eat.
Shell, 5-6 Henry.
South section clear.
Roger that.
All right. I'm goin' down
for a closer look.
A very big wood bee.
Contact, Sector Six.
Do you copy, Shell?
- Roger that.
- Shell.
I said, "Contact!" Whoo!
We found 'em!
North corridor, Sector Six.
- Mom!
- Do you copy?
Second river,
south of the Curraray.
Mom! Mom!
Stevie boy?
Contact. Sector Six.
Do you copy?
Um, c-contact. Sector Six.
Roger that.
I'm goin' around.
I saw one. I know I did.
Mincayani's kissing thejaguar.
The days that followed
were like Christmas.
Our home was kind of a base
for everyone who lived in thejungles.
Dad would fly them in and out
of remote airstrips...
bringing them supplies.
But those missionaries, the families
that came to our house...
to celebrate finding
the Waodani...
they were special.
The Elliots, the McCullys,
the Flemings and the Youderians.
They were closer to us
than any blood family.
And the bucket turns
in an even bigger circle.
Of course, if you do it like that.
Dad, of course,
was always forging ahead.
Just-Jim,just watch me.
What we're gonna do...
is we're gonna let out...
so much line
that the drag...
of that line is gonna work
with centrifugal force.
See that? And as I keep the airplane
in that tight, continuous turn-
Oh, wow. Look at that.
Huh? The bucket stays in almost
exactly the same spot.
It hardly moves.
- In theory. In theory.
- In theory.
- Do you know what theory is?
- In theory.
- Do you believe me?
- Mm-hmm.
You know what this means?
This is it. W-W-We...
made contact.
Actually, Nate, I've made
some contact of my own.
I've been learning some Waodani
phrases from Dayumae.
Oh, come on, buddy,just relax.
I've been very careful about this.
Rachel knows absolutely nothing about this.
Do you realize what that means?
It means it's time
to rejoin the planet.
It means that I can say...
"Where's the john" in Waodani!
UncleJim.
- Oh, UncleJim.
- Wanna try this, son?
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't you tell Rachel?
She understands the language
better than any of us.
Betty, I tell my sister...
and she's gonna go tell
her superiors.
Next, we're gonna still be talkin'
about this in two years.
We don't have two years, Betty.
The Waodani are killing...
so many people.
The government's under pressure.
They're gonna bring in troops.
We have one chance
to reach these people.
Now. This is it.
If Nate's bucket drop
really works-
He thinks he can find
a place to put the plane down-
Maybe a sand bar-
Hey! We'll call it "Palm Beach. "
- Jim.
- Oh, come on.!
Me Tarzan!
Jim, this is not a picnic.
No one's ever made contact with
these people and lived to talk about it.
We'll have our guns.
We'll shoot in the air.
The Indians always run
from guns.
They always run, Olive.
What if they don't run?
- It looks like they're home.
- Oh,yeah.!
Are you sure this'll work?
You know what theory is?
I know what "idiot" is.
- Let's go. Bucket time.!
- Copy that.
Whoo!
;Vaya con Dios.!
- Whoo!
- Here we go!
Whoa.! Steady there, boy.
You're shakin'my breakfast.
Don't throw up on the Waodani.
Dayumae is alive!
Dayumae is alive!
- Dayumae is alive.
- They've eaten her!
That was incredible!
The guys are never
gonna believe it.
This is fantastic!
Aunt Rachel lived in a remote
Quechua village that bordered Waodani territory.
She was 12 years older than Dad
and helped raise him.
I knew Dad was protecting her by
keeping the Waodani contact a secret.
I just wanted someone
to protect Dad.
Ila, Ila.
Shell calling Ila. Over.
Ila, this is Shell. Over.
Stevie, what a wonderful surprise.
How are you?
Oh, I'm good, Aunt Rachel.
I'm good.
I'm preparing a little surprise
for Mom, and I need some help.
A surprise? Sounds great.
Fire away.
Mom wanted Dad to speak at least
one line of native dialect properly...
but now he's driving her nuts.
Hey, don't be so hard on him.
His Quechua's not that bad.
No, not Quechua. Waodani.
Waodani? Why?
Well, because he wants to
be able to greet Dayumae...
next time she comes.
All right. What do you
have in mind?
Something simple like,
"I'm your friend. "
So, you want
"I'm your friend," in Wao?
"Your sincere friend. "
Well, that's an easy one.
Just repeat this after Dayumae.
- Hi, Dayumae.
- Hello, Stevie.
We say-
We must spear Moipa quickly.
Not the children!
Who has killed Moipa?
Show yourself.
Let me see you.
A boy?
A boy has killed Moipa?
We'll take the women with us.
Moipa doesn't deserve
to go into the earth.!
He's a warrior just like us!
Let the Great Boa judge him,
not Nampa!
This one will make my drink.
What do you say?
No. Don't take it.
No. No, don't take it.
- They give us something?
- Yeah.
You're kidding me.
- Whoa!
- Must be a very special bird.
Here we go! Whoo!
What's going on down there?
Whoa! Cut the line,Jim.
Anytime, buddy!
Stevie boy! Lunch!
Honey, your daddy
won't be back for hours.
I'm not hungry.
I knew we had a small runway.
I tried to imagine Dad landing
on the river sandbar...
he'd found
near the Waodani village.
I told him I wished
I could be there with him.
He said, "Don't worry.
You will be. "
Come on!
What will I do?
Here we go.
Wanna go with Mama?
Go Mama with the little rocks
in your hand?
Oh! My little girl.
Be good.
Son, you know I can
leave that here.
You just say the word.
Good boy.
Let's get it in the airplane.
I guess that's it.
Do you know how far away
the sun is?
93,000,000 miles.
Do you know that
that's a fraction...
of how much
your daddy loves you?
If the Waodani attack...
will you defend yourself?
Will you use your guns?
Son, we can't shoot the Waodani.
They're not ready for heaven.
We are.
Promise me one thing,
just one-
"One thing. "
You sound like your mother.
If you get in a jam,
a real jam...
promise me you'll say
these words to them.
What words?
The Waodani words.
They mean
"I am your friend.
Your sincere friend. "
- Right?
- Yeah.
Okay. Come here.
Have everything then?
Let's see.
One, two, three, four.
- Good.
- Bye.
Watch.
- Come back to me.
- Hey.
All right?
See you on the radio.
Stevie, be a good boy.
I love you, Dad.
I love you.
Don't be afraid of us.!
The creator God
you call Waengongi-
Waengongi has sent us.
We'rejust like you.
Roger, what do ya think?
All this preaching to the jungle, how long
before the monkeys get saved?
Yeah, well, at least if they do,
we'll know someone's listening.
The creator God is our friend.
What's he talking about?
How does that one sound like a woman?
Even when drinking?
I'll go to them...
and see if Dayumae lives.
The foreigners are cannibals.
I'll go with my sister.
No, I'll go.
Go home to your second wife...
and stay away from my sister!
Enough.!
Let's go hunting.
Gentlemen!
We got company.
We're just like you.
We're just like you.
Ed. My name is Ed. What is your name?
Dayumae is my sister.
Can you show me
where she is?
Can you take me
in the wood bee?
Maybe her name is
really, really long.
I'll be very happy
if you take me.
Take me to Dayumae.
Take me to Dayumae.
All right. I- I don't-
- I don't know-
- He wants something.
Nate.! Nate, the gun.!
Take me to Dayumae.
All right. Airplane. Airplane.
Yeah. I-
That's what you want?
I guess we're gonna go
for a ride.
Mincayani why are you so small,
and I am so fast?
Oh, no, no!
Yeah!
The wood bee flies fast.
He tried to get out of the airplane
right above the village.
Did you see Dayumae?
No, I saw Mincayani and Kimo
like ants.
They saw him.
They know we're friendly.
Why don't you
take me to Dayumae?
- Uh-
- We don't understand you.
Go up? Up?
Pete, come here.
I don't know-
I'll check my notes.
They speak so fast.
These foreigners
understand nothing.
Gimade, where are you going?
I guess it's suppertime.
I think you're
a very tall woman.
You sing like
a beautiful canary.
She just proposed to you, Roger.
Why's he alone with my sister?
Where's Maengamo?
Where is she?
The foreigners attacked us.
We ran!
But we saw you
in the wood bee!
I wanted to see Dayumae...
but they already killed her.
Gimade, is this true?
We didn't see her.
She must be dead.
Don't the foreigners
always kill us?
- Why should we spear each other?
- I say we spear them now.
Mincayani, what do you say?
Nenkiwi says they've killed Dayumae!
What else does Nenkiwi say?
- I say they ate her flesh.
- They can't eat if they're dead.
Nenkiwi's right.
We must spear them!
Here. Don't drink it all.
What are you trying to say, Petey?
Missionaries.
What? Oh.
Come in, Shell.! Come in.!
Shell, come in.
Come in, Shell.
56 Henry. This is Shell.
56 Henry.
This is Shell.
Dad, this is Steve.
Are you okay?
Missed your call time.
Tell the owner of the parrot
I'm taking good care of it.
And I know it's a loan, okay?
Okay. Mom wants to talk now.
Please pick up.
Please, Dad.
All the foreigners are coming.
- They search for us?
- No. They searched for the others.
They'll never find them.
The river has hid them.
We've angered all the spirits.
Rachel, it was so hard
for Nate not to tell you.
