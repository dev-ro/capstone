First time the FBI voluntarily showed up
around this stretch, huh?
Doesn't seem to be a shortage
in crime, does there?
Well, I appreciate you reaching out.
I'm gonna give you some background.
Couple years ago,
I got assigned two Jane Doe cases.
Both drug-friendly truck stop prostitutes.
Both dumped off the I-10.
Both strangled, assaulted, bitten,
and bodies suggestively staged
in view from the highway.
Now, nobody wanted to touch it.
Just an impossible to get around.
And then another body turned up.
- [camera shutter clicking]
- And then another.
Until we had six.
And a bona fide serial killer.
Who worked that for the Bureau?
A whip-smart analyst
with the state bureau built the profile,
FBI gave it to a behavioral specialist
to confirm what we knew.
White, male, truck driver, mid-30s,
but nothing groundbreaking.
Some people, they just think that...
the girls, the hookers and the druggies,
they got what they had coming.
What do you believe?
Hard luck in life don't make you
any less of a human.
Everybody needs a chance
to get back on their feet.
Few days ago, a body was discovered
up by the state line.
Same M.O. to a T. And then
last night at the motel,
it was still him,
but it was just rushed, improvised.
- Why the break in routine?
- Honestly...
I kinda think he was looking for you.
But my question is... why?
I started communicating a few weeks ago
through an online ad.
Decided to meet up
at a motel in Loxley.
Some locals jumped prematurely,
started making arrests.
I didn't blow my cover.
After a little more... e-flirting,
we decided to meet up
at the Oasis a few nights ago,
and some low-level pimp
spooked him off.
- Stayed on me, though.

We were supposed to meet
at the Mustang last night.

You just said that you think
he's looking for me.
He's gonna wanna try again.
Do you think that girl that disappeared
from the Oasis is still alive?
I don't know. Maybe.
[Rebecca] Okay then,
who reported her missing?
[Byron] I got a call from her sister,
Heather Wallace.
- Heather?
- Hmm.
I'm the one that called.

Are you a cop?
Just here to help.

And I was told I had
to pay it off. You know?
