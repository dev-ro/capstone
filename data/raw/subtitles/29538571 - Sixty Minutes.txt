[man 1 breathing heavily]
DEA
[soft music playing]
DEAR
[woman] Octa!
DEAR LEONIE
[man 1 sighs]
DEAR LEONIE,
[woman] Octa!
[electronic music playing]
[man 2] Yes, exactly.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
- Yes.
- [man 3] Just like that.
Yes, exactly. Exactly.
That's what I've been saying.
Can we do this or you just wanna sit
on your butt all day? Come on. Go. Jab!
Up high. Hup, hup, hup!
Hup, hup!
{\an8}Do it. Again.
{\an8}My man has been warming up.
Where are you?
Hup! Hup, hup, hup, hup!
One and... Bam, easy!
[man 4 grunting]
{\an8}And go!
{\an8}Nice.
And...
Hey! [chuckles]
And shoot!
- [man 4 groans]
- [woman] Nice. Control, control, control.
And hit!
[man 4 groans]
Mount. Pretty good form.
You might actually win this today.
[groans]
[man 2] Hey, what do you think
you're doing? Whoa, man.
You're supposed to be warming up,
not burning yourself out.
Oh, yeah, funny guy.
[groans]
Fucker! Get hurt and we might as well
forget about the whole fucking thing.
- How long should I be warming up?
- No idea. You need to ask fucking Benko.
- We've been waiting for an hour.
- [man 2] I know.
But the ref says we're about to start.
Benko's arrived.
So, stay warmed up, okay?
Cosi, don't overdo it with him, all right?
- You gonna finally pay me?
- If they delay anymore, we'll cancel.
{\an8}We're not canceling anything, man.
{\an8}I have to go to Leonie.
{\an8}Octa, we need this fight, man. All right?
I'll go ahead and wait in the car.
Hurry up.
{\an8}[panting]
[male trainer] Yeah, hup, hup!
{\an8}CONGRATULATIONS ON THE OPENING!
[distant male trainer shouting]
[Cosi] Come on, let's go.
[male trainer and Cosi continue shouting]
[sighs]
[ringing tone]
- Hello.
- Hello, my lion.
Happy birthday.
You gonna be here soon?
Papa just has to finish something up
at work.
- I'll head over right after.
- Everyone's about to leave.
Hey, they're gonna miss the best part.
The best cake in the world, right?
- [woman] Leonie?
- Yeah.
I made sure not to eat anything,
- so I'd have room for the cake.
- [woman] Leonie!
And wait until you see the other surprise.
You're not coming, are you?
Hey. Of course I'm coming.
I'm definitely coming, I promise.
- [knock at door]
- There's just a small delay here.
Mm-hmm.
- [door opens]
- [Cosi] Octa!
- I gotta talk to you.
- Cosi...
- [door closes]
- You're gonna listen to me.
Leonie, I'm coming. I promise.
See you soon. What's up?
Paul swore to me I'd be getting a raise
five months ago.
- Yeah?
- [Cosi] Yeah.
I didn't even get the money
from the last fight.
I don't know about money stuff.
- Can you not talk to Paul?
- [Octa] Look at this.
ONION
What's that?
What do you mean, what is that?
It's a cat.
Why does it say "Onion"?
- 'Cause that's its name.
- Octa.
- It's a present for Leonie.
- Come on, man, that raise is overdue. Hey!
I'll talk to Paul. Okay?
Seriously, do that.
- [Octa] Hmm!
- [groans]
[Octa] After the fight.
- Just do it.
- [Octa] Yeah.
{\an8}So, what kind of a stupid cat name
is Onion? Who came up with that?
{\an8}The animal shelter.
Ha-ya. Ho! Ha!
Ha!
[man] Hey! Better, right?
Yeah, you need
that kind of bullshit in a fight.
{\an8}- [man] Yeah, yeah.
- Hey. You have three more days to prepare.
{\an8}- [man] Okay.
- Good luck.
{\an8}Thanks.
{\an8}[Paul] Yeah. Okay, we're leaving now.
All right. See you soon.
Okay, ref says 15 minutes.
[Cosi] Man, almost an hour late.
[Paul] Yeah, that idiot doesn't think
you can get stuck in traffic
between Frankfurt and Berlin.
Fucking Benko.
DEAR LEONIE,
"Dear Leonie."
[mocking voice] "Dear Leonie."
A bit formal, isn't it?
What's so formal about it?
It's like when you say, "Dear."
It's like... really formal.
Like, "Dear landlord, I can't pay
my rent." That's where you'd use it.
- [Octa] It's how you write in a card.
- Not one to your daughter.
What... Hey, hey, hey!
What are you doing, man?
- Why can't I get this right?
- Because the fight is on her birthday.
But that's not your fault.
Yeah, it's never my fault.
- [Paul] Okay, it's that time again?
- Paul!
No, no, no, no. Don't worry, no problem.
Happy to do it. Listen up, here we go.
Hey, no one who has a child at 19,
who still has to get along with his ex,
whom he never
should have messed around with
because she's not a good fit for him,
but he just wouldn't listen
to his best friend...
Leave it, Paul.
[Paul]...who also wants to have a career
in sports can do all of it well, okay?
[Octa] I can't take too many shots.
I don't wanna show up all busted up.
- [Cosi] Hello? You're not gonna get hit.
- [Paul] No, no, I get it.
I knew all along
you were scared shitless of fucking Benko.
- Fuck you.
- Like the other losers.
- Can you take him?
- I'll kick his ass.
- Convincing!
- I'll take him!
- If you don't want a black eye...
- I'll destroy that motherfucker!
- Kill that motherfucker!
- I'll beat his brains in!
- I'll pound him so fucking hard!
- Not my fucking car!
- Let's go.
- Can you pick up the cat for me?
Can I do what?
And the cake. No, forget it, I'll do that.
Cat. At the animal shelter.
Present for Leonie.
Uh, Onion?
- That's not a cat's name.
- [Cosi snickers]
- Fuck you, guys.
- Octa, we're just bugging you, man.
Yeah, right.
Ask me again if I want a black eye.
- You ruined the moment.
- Ask me again if I want a black eye.
- Ask me again.
- The moment's ruined.
Just ask me again if I want a black eye.
- Want a black eye?
- I'll destroy that motherfucker!
- Kill the bastard!
- Destroy that motherfucker!
Jesus, dude!
How many times do I have to tell you?
- [Cosi] Let's go.
- [Octa] Sorry, man.

Ah, fuck. We need to say
a quick hello over there.
Hey, there he is,
Octavio fucking Bergmann!
Man, I'm so excited to finally meet you.
Octa, Cosi, Chino Winkler, his brother.
- Nice to meet you.
- I cannot wait for this.
And after, we'll all go out
and have a few drinks together.
- [Paul] Yeah, let's see, right?
- No, not "let's see."
We're going out to have a drink.
I bet on this guy.
And that means
we gotta fucking celebrate after.
Let him go fight first.
- Bad mood?
- No, the mood is great.
That's not what his face says. [chuckles]
[Winkler] Go get warmed up.
[tense music playing]
You can do it, big guy.
Show that fucking prick
that we don't whack off in Berlin.
We get fucking laid, hmm?
- [Octa] What's your problem?
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Get out of my face, man.
- Just chill.
- Adrenaline.
- Just chill.
- I love it. Adrenaline!
- Relax.
Make way for this guy.
- Whoo!
- What's going on with you?
[Chino] Trash him, Octavio!
- Calm down. Take it easy.
- I am calm. He got all up in my space.
Calm down and get your fucking hands off!
[Chino] Octavio Bergmann!
- Why do you bring idiots like that here?
- The guy's an old friend, all right?
Those guys are idiots.
[hip-hop music playing in background]
- [assistant] We ready finally?
- [Octa sighs]
[Cosi] Hurry up.
Warm up a little bit more.
[Paul] Okay, how's your pulse?
Okay, cool. You're dead.
Give me your watch. I need to sync it.
Okay. [sighs]
All right.
We still have a few minutes.
Let's go and see the ref, okay?
[Cosi] Okay.
- See you in a bit.
- See you in a bit.
[cell phone vibrates]
Hey, Mina. I'm just having
the bandages put on.
- You haven't had the fight yet?
- [Octa] They pushed it back three times.
Another fight has been moved up.
- Why are you telling Leonie you'll come?
- I am coming.
You schedule a fight
on your daughter's birthday,
then you say you're going to be there,
and you're not?
Don't you understand
that she's been waiting for you all day?
I'll be there.
Leonie has hardly eaten anything today
because you promised her some stupid cake.
If you can't be bothered
to see your daughter, just say so.
- Hey!
- [Mina] You're constantly late.
Most times, you don't show up at all.
The fight is only three rounds, okay?
[Mina] No way
are you gonna make it by 6:00.
Then I'll be there at 7:00.
[Mina] For three months,
we agreed you were gonna be here at 5:00.
These kids all leave at 6:00
when their parents get here.
You know what?
I'm done with your shit.
[indistinct background chatter]
- [cell phone chimes]
- I'm...
[Paul clears throat]
So, how're you doing? Ready to go?
[Octa sighs]
I need to make it today.
Okay.
[Octa sighs]
Okay, Octa. Listen to me for a second.
Just listen to me for a second.
We need this fight.
We need the money. All right?
After, I'll personally drive you
to Leonie. Okay?
I'll race through the city at 200 clicks,
then drive you guys
to the fucking moon if I have to, okay?
But right now, you need to focus.
Big-time.
She hasn't eaten all day
because she's waiting for my cake.
And you know whose fault that is,
don't you?
You know exactly who we have to thank
for all this fucking bullshit.
That ugly piece of shit motherfucker
out there.
That's why you're gonna go out there
and beat the living shit
out of that fucking prick Benko so badly
that he'll never be late
for anything again.
[Cosi] Okay, guys.
Here we go. Let's go.
Yeah, man.
[German hip-hop music playing]
Okay, remember your strategy.
Stay on the defense.
Let him burn himself out.
Once he's tired,
force him to the floor. Three points.
Stay on defense
until he burns himself out,
then ground and pound.
Force him to the floor. Got it?
[Octa] Okay.
[hip-hop music continues playing]
[announcer] All right, Berlin.
Are you ready
for the biggest fight of the day?
- [man] Hey.
- [female voice] Call from Mina.
[phone chimes]
Mina.
It's me.
- What? David, what do you want?
- Octavio, it's over.
- It's not a good time. I gotta fight.
- Mina is filing for sole custody.
I'm representing her as her lawyer.
You'll have the documents
in your mailbox tomorrow.
You must know that legally, there are
more than enough reasons for this.
- What the fuck are you saying?
- [David] Leonie is in her room crying.
- Shut the fuck up! That's my daughter.
- [Mina] Your daughter?
How is she your daughter? Who's taken care
of her for seven fucking years?
Get here by six o'clock or I'll make sure
you never see your daughter again.
- You have one hour.
- [phone chimes]
[Cosi] Hey! Hey, where are you going?
- Hey, what's going on?
- No idea.
What's happening?
[Velcro ripping]
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing, man? Huh?
Don't fuck around. Get your ass
in the cage. Octa, man, what...
Listen, I understand
what you're going through.
But we'll figure it out.
We'll find a solution.
Hey! Listen to me. We'll find...
[Paul groans]
Sorry.
Mina is gonna take Leonie away.
Fuck.
Octa Bergmann, my man.
How the hell are you doing, tiger?
- [Octa] All good.
- [man] How's it going with your gym?
You're gonna rock this today. I know it.
- Sting like a...
- Sorry, Rico. Not a good time.
I got big money on you, Octa.
Let's get ready to rumble!
Don't be such a chickenshit.
Show a little initiative.
I'm trying.
No, you're not. You just stand around
like some two-bit punk.
- Hey, Bergmann! Where you goin'?
- [Chino] Going somewhere?
- Bergmann!
- [Chino] What the hell are you doing?
[Winkler] Get back here!
[Chino] Come on, people, move it. Go, go!
- Ladies, what the fuck?
- He's taking off.
- [Winkler] You've got a fight!
- [Chino] We'll catch up to him. Go!
[Winkler] Get the car from the garage.
Bring him back.
This son of a bitch has to fight,
or we're all fucked!
[dramatic electronic music playing]
- [phone chimes]
- [female voice] Voice message from Leonie.
[Leonie] Dad, you have to come.
Mom is really angry.
- [Mina] Leonie, put that phone away!
- [beep]
Hey!
- [driver] Hey!
- [Octa] Sorry.
[indistinct chatter]
- [woman] Hey!
- [man 1] Watch it!
- [woman] Watch it!
- [man 2 groans] Fuck you, man!
[Octa panting]
[man] Hey! Hello? Hey, buddy!
- Hello?
- Drive, please. I'm in a hurry.
Asshole, open up!
- Wiedeking?
- [knocking]
- Hey!
- Yeah. Hurry, please.
You sure don't look
like your name's Wiedeking.
Well, it is.
- [driver] That's his name.
- Hello?
[Winkler] Over there! The car!
Dude, just drive.
- Hey, fatso. Open the door!
- All right, Mr. Wiedeking.
- Buckle up, here we go.
- [Wiedeking] Hey!
What do you want, assholes?
- All right, the name's Ronny. Where to?
- Max Beer Street. Step on it.
Yeah, I got the whole "hurry" all right.
But I don't think
that's gonna happen during rush hour.
[soft music playing]
[line ringing]
- Octa, man.
- What the fuck is going on?
- Things are fucked up.
- Nothing I can do about this traffic.
You probably know
there's a major shitstorm going on here.
- You just took off.
- I told you. I gotta get there.
Relax. I'm doing the best I can.
- Explain what the hell Mina's problem is.
- Ronny, I'm on the phone.
Oh, s-sorry.
Who's Ronny?
So, who's this old friend of yours?
What kind of drugs is he on?
- He lost his shit when I left just now.
- All right, listen.
Since your opponent got here late,
I can buy us a bit of time
before you get disqualified,
but you have to absolutely come back
right fucking now!
[distant chatter]
- [Octa] What's happening now?
- [Ronny] Prenzlauer Berg is happening.
And this was supposed to be
my secret shortcut.
Ronny, turn around.
[Ronny] Let me first have a look
to see what'll be the best way.
And the meter's still running
for Wiedeking.
We'll let that jerk foot the bill, eh?
[chuckles]
- [man 1] Whoa! Hey!
- [woman 1] What's he doing?
- [man 2] What's going on?
- [woman 2] Watch it, asshole!
- [man 3] What's your problem?
- [Winkler] Hey!
- [man 4] Hey!
- [Winkler] Hey, just hold up a minute!
Watch it! What are you doing?
- Seriously!
- [man 5] Hey!
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?
[grunts]
Wanna tell me
what the fuck your problem is?
[Chino] There's no problem. Just get
your ass in the car and come with us.
[inhales deeply]
Don't hurt him.
[man chuckles]
[grunting and groaning]
Hey, careful! This guy has to fight today.
He still has to fight!
- Hey!
- [groaning]
[Winkler] What's going on with you?
Get up and fight. Get in there!
[groaning]
[sighs]
[Octa groans loudly]
Go on, fuck, get him!
Come on, come on, come on, hurry!
[groaning]
Stop fucking around.
You guys fight like cunts!
Move your lazy asses. Go on, fight!
Get in there and fucking help them!
[Winkler] Grab him!
- [Chino] He still has to fight.
- [Winkler] Come on!
- [Chino] Go in, go in!
- [Winkler] Come on!
Nice.
[groaning]
- [man] Yeah!
- [Chino] Come on!
Put him to sleep. Yeah, that's it.
- That's it.
- [Winkler] Nice.
[Chino] Now get him into the car.
He still has a fight to fight.
Watch the seats.
Don't scratch the fucking leather!
[Winkler] You two are coming with me.
Let's go.
Okay, go through there,
and then turn right. Go!
[groans]
[hip-hop music playing]
- [Winkler] Finally. Where's the car?
- Here.
Get a better crew.
[hip-hop music continues playing]
[groaning]
[tires screech]
[groaning continues]
[driver breathing heavily]
Open up!
[man groans]
[electronic music playing]
[man groans]
[grunting and groaning]
[soft ambient music playing]
Yeah.
Where are you right now?
Hmm.
- [injured man coughs]
- Hang on a second.
- [phone chimes]
- [female voice] Call from Mom.
[chime]
Not a good time. Can I call you back?
Why... why am I not allowed
to see Leonie today?
Had a little fight with Mina,
but I'm working it out.
Mina texted me that the party's canceled.
Sounds like more than a little fight.
The boys from Gregor's. Now!
Take care of it.
Tell me what's going on.
Don't worry about it, all right?
I just wanna see my granddaughter
on her birthday, okay?
- I'll call back later.
- Octavio, don't...
Call Paul.
- [female voice] Calling Paul.
- [ringing tone]
Octa.
Paul. Who is Chino?
Listen. [sniffs]
Look, I've done a little digging, okay?
Uh, Chino, his brother,
all those other assholes.
Got a betting ring.
But there's also some more serious shit.
Was the fight rigged?
- Yeah, it was rigged.
- [sniffs and sighs]
Chino bet 75 G's on you,
and fucking Benko was gonna go down
in the third round.
We can still turn this shit show around
before you're disqualified.
I'll figure it all out.
But you have to get here.
No matter what, okay?
I just knocked them all out.
- Who did you knock out?
- All of them.
- All of them?
- All of them.
[Paul sighs]
- I need to be at Leonie's in 50 minutes.
- Fuck! Fucking hell!
- Can you not explain to Mina...
- Explain what?
That I just beat the shit
out of a bunch of guys?
That doesn't help me with custody.
Paul, get the fuck out of there!
Those people are dangerous.
[Winkler] Hey! Over here!
Okay, Octa. Wait, what...
[Winkler] Come on. After him!
Go get him!
[engines revving loudly]
[Octa panting]
[Octa] Voice message to Cosima.
Is anyone at the gym? I need your help.
- [female voice] Sending voice message.

[Octa grunts]
[Cosi] I don't know what's happening,
but you have to get here.
- Hey! Get in there.
- [Cosi] I gotta go.
- Octa!
- [Octa] Come on.
[engines revving loudly]
What's going on?
They're after me.
Bruno! Annika.
[door bangs]
[distant hip-hop music playing]
[door bangs]
[man grunting]
[distant hip-hop music continues playing]
- The cops will be here in a minute.
- Yeah? Fuck you.
Okay.
[grunting and groaning]
[hip-hop music playing]
Hey! What the fuck is going on here?
I have to get to Leonie.
Hold them off a bit longer.
[grunting]
20%.
I told you I don't know anything
about the money stuff.
[Cosi] 20%, or I'm not doing
another single thing here.
My landlord's been trying to kick me out
for six months. I need the money.
[groaning]
[cries in pain]
[groaning]
- Mina wants to take her away from me.
- [sighs]
- Shit.
- [door bangs]
Okay. Just pick up the cake for me.
Max Beer Street, Pastry Guys.
And bring it to Leonie. I'll talk to Paul.
Okay, deal.
- [man grunting]
- One, two, three.
[groaning]
[cries in pain]
[groans]
[grunting]
[Annika yells]
[grunts]
[man cries in pain]
[grunting and groaning]
Fuck you!
[cries in pain]
Move, you fucking rat!
[grunting]
[hip-hop music playing]
[groans]
[yells]
[both grunt]
[Annika yells]
[groans]
[grunting and groaning]
[Winkler] You little cunt!
Go on. Go get that son of a bitch.
Get him!
Get in the car!
- [chime]
- [female voice] Text message from Cosima.
"They are armed. Be careful."
[man] Hey!
[panting]
POLICE
[men panting]
Don't fuck around, man.
- [female cop] What's going on there?
- [male cop] What does he want?
Be careful.
- [tires screech]
- [Octa] Hey!
- [female cop] What now?
- Shit.
[female cop] Are you crazy? What is this?
Are you fucking blind or what?
- [female cop] Hey!
- Everybody, just calm down.
- What's your deal?
- [Octa] Forget it, you clowns!
- What'd you just call us?
- [Octa] Clowns.
All right, that's it. I was trying
to be nice. Now show me some ID.
- [female cop] Stop right there.
- [male cop] You're gonna come with us now.
I'm what?
- You think I'm a clown?
- He tried to...
- Let's go.
- You were all screwing with us.
I knocked on your window
to ask a question, and you didn't open it.
Clear the road, please.
Nothing happened here. Keep it moving.
- Get in the car.
- Why are you coming at me?
- He's the one who just about hit me.
- Get in the car!
You can explain what you and your friends
were doing at the station, okay?
- [Octa] I don't have time for this.
- Grab him.
Let's go. Get in the car.
With or without handcuffs?
Your choice.
Let's go.
[car doors close]
[female cop] Put your seatbelt on.
[male cop] This is unit 12.
We're transporting a suspect
back to the station
for suspicious activities
and insulting an officer.
We'll be testing for drug use.
Which station are we going to?
- [female cop] You a comedian or something?
- The one at Alex?
[male cop] Why?
That your favorite station? [chuckles]
[Octa] Which one?
- This isn't the way to Alex.
- Shut up and take it easy!
What did I do anyway?
Obstructing traffic
and interfering with police.
- I got hit by a car!
- [male cop] Section 315, criminal code.
[female cop] Exactly.
[Octa] Can you please just tell me
which station we're going to?
Which station would you like to go to?
Just tell us and we'll drive you there.
Or should we make a little stop...
[female voice] Text message from Cosima.
"I'm there, but the cake wasn't paid for."
- "My card got declined."
- Shit.
[female voice] "Hashtag raise."
- Fuck.
- [female voice] Reply to Cosima.
- "Shit. Fuck." Send?
- No!
Hey, not to get too personal,
but do you have Tourette's or something?
- Shut the fuck up.
- What?
- [male cop] Have you lost your marbles?
- Shut your fucking mouth!
- Are you out of your mind?
- You shut the fuck up too!
Fuck both of you!
Verbally abusing a police officer,
section 185 of the criminal code.
[groaning]
What in the actual fuck is wrong with you?
[groans]
[panting]
- [groans]
- [Winkler] You're coming with me now.
Enough of your shit!
I've been running around the fucking city.
You have no idea
who you're messing with right now.
I'm doing you a favor. Trust me. So...
[Winkler groans]
You have no fucking idea
who you're dealing with.
Don't fuck around now. You hear me?

Octa, man, what's going on?
Annika is in the hospital.
She has a broken rib.
Bruno isn't doing good at all.
And I just talked to Chino.
Yeah. And?
I'm not even gonna bother telling you
what he said,
but he wants your ass in the cage...
He doesn't lose his fucking money
if the fight doesn't happen.
He does. With an illegal bet,
the money is gone.
But he swore to me that he wasn't
gonna hurt you if you come back.
- Yeah.
- Octa, man, let's...

I'm at the cake shop now.
I'll get... I'll get the cake and...
[panting]
[sniffs]
I, uh...
I'm...
I don't know what to say.
[panting]
Please don't do this, okay?
[sniffs]
I'll be there soon.
- Send voice message.
- [female voice] Sending voice message.
- How's Annika doing?
- She'll be okay.
- Hey, guys.
- I ordered a cake for Bergmann.
- One sec.
- [Octa] Hurry up, please.
Octa, you need to go to the police.
- That your water?
- Yeah.
Can you at least tell me
who those guys are?
[sighs] The fight was rigged.
Holy shit!
All right, here we go.
[Octa] Perfect. Thank you.
I'll pay with card.
[sniffs]
[indistinct background chatter]
[chimes]
Thank you.
We'll talk later.
[Winkler sighs] Last chance, Bergmann.
Put that down.
Come with us and it'll all work out.
- Get out of my way.
- You can't keep your mouth shut, can you?
Put your pretty little cake down
and get your ass in the fucking car.
Please.

Fucker!
[Octa panting]

[Paul] They disqualified you.
Chino's money is gone.
So is Benko's.
The motherfucker was part of it too.
[soft beeping]
Paul called you?
No, I called him. I wanted to know
why you ran away from the fight.
What's going on with Mina this time?
Long story.
Hey, I got time.
Yeah, I don't. I have to get to Leonie.
Can you take me to the subway?
[Rico] Sure. Our club
is right next to a station.
You can go through there, right ahead.
[Octa sighs]
Thanks, Rico. I owe you one.
- I'm sorry, kiddo.
- All good, it's not your fault.
I am sorry.

Don't fuck around.

[knuckles crack]
Octa, just tell them
what's up with Chino, man.
Leave.
I've no idea what this is about.
- I've known him all my life.
- Leave!
Rico, what's going on?
What's going on?
[speaks in Serbian]

[motorbike engine starts]
[Octa] Hey, hey!
I have no idea what this is about, man.
[speaks in Serbian]
[man] Why didn't you fight in the match?
My ex wants to take my daughter away
from me. I have to get over there.
[man speaks in Serbian]

Your daughter. What's her name?

You need to get over here and tell us
how you're gonna pay back

Is that you?

[indistinct background chatter]
[groans]
[panting]
You tracked me.
And told them where I was.
[distant siren wailing]
Okay, listen.
When you took off back there,
I really thought it would be best
if you just came back.
And that's why I helped them,
I swear to God.
But when they started threatening you,
that's when I stopped helping them.
But at that point, it was already
too late. They almost fucking killed me.
Paul.
Yeah?
Run.
Octa, please, man.
We could actually work with them.
- With Chino.
- [sighs]
Listen, I'm starting
to figure all this shit out, okay?
Chino didn't just bet
his own money on you.
He also bet 500 grand
of other people's money.
Now you are the only one who can help him
straighten this fucking mess out.
In ten seconds, I'm getting up.
[sighs] Dude, don't you fucking get it?
Chino needs you.
He needs us. He bet half a million on you
for some fucking assholes.
The fucking gambling mafia.
Only you can help him straighten out
all this shit, man. Don't you get that?
They wanted to kill me just now.
- Okay, if we work with Chino, have some...
- Shut the fuck up!
- ...rigged fights, we make back that money.
- Shut your fucking mouth!
Come on!
[sighs deeply]
Run. Fuck off.

[Octa gasps softly]
- Oh!
- You need to see a doctor.
- [Octa] Got any of those headache pills?
- Oh!
- I'll call an ambulance.
- [Octa] No.
[sighs]
[mom] What happened?
[sighs] It's all good.
[sighs]
A scooter driver hit me.
[sighs]
It's all good.
[soft beeping]
Marco.
[door opens]
[door closes]
Could you move?
- [mom] Octavio, please talk to us.
- [Octa] I just need to rest for a minute.
[sighs]
- [mom] Why won't you see a doctor?
- I need to get to Leonie.
Like this?
Yeah, I have to. I...
[mom] Mina's never gonna let you
see Leonie looking like this.
- [phone chimes]
- [female voice] Call from Paul.
Answer?
Quiet for a second. I need to take this.
[phone chimes]
[frozen vegetables crinkling]
Look, I fucked up.
We got money problems.
Major ones.
I just didn't wanna tell you
because I, uh...
I wanted to fix it all myself.
Octa.
It was my idea to rig the fight.
I'm so sorry, man. I, uh...
I thought it would be a quick
and easy way to get us some money.
And... [inhales]
...you and Cosi and everyone else never
would have had to know anything about it.
That's...
Yeah, well, anyway, I, uh... [inhales]
I wanted you to know everything,
so maybe you could trust me again.
You can trust me, man.
I just wanted to make some fast money,
and then fucking Chino dragged me
into this somehow, okay?
I'm sorry, dude.
If I could turn back the clock, I would.
It's okay.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man.
Any way I can help you?
Where are you right now?
On your way to Leonie? Or, uh...
Or are you going to pick up the cat?
[chuckles softly]
[gun clicks]
And, uh, by the way,
you asked me for a good cat's name, right?
An ex-girlfriend of mine had a cat,
and you know what she called it?
Onion.
Yeah, I know. Sounds stupid, but...
but also funny somehow, right?
I won't make it to Leonie today.
Sorry, man.
And, um, uh, where are you right now?
I'm at a buddy's house.
I'll get back to you later.
- What are you talking about...
- [phone chimes]
[sighs softly]
- Have I always been such a mess?
- [mom] Huh?
With Leonie.
I...
[Marco] You're scared.
What?
Suddenly, there's this tiny human
in your life
that you have to take care of,
that you're responsible for,
and what do you do?
You fuck up and you're unreliable.
You let everyone down
that you're close to,
who you say you love,
and it's never your fault.
- The whole universe is always against you.
- [mom] Marco.
[Marco] "I have this fight, tournament,
still some work to do at the boxing gym."
- He's trying.
- He's not trying. He's scared.
Scared of having nothing to offer.
Of being a shitty father.
Of doing everything wrong.
So, he'd rather run away,
and abandon his child.
Leave her behind.
Because in the end,
he's trying to prevent her
from becoming just like he is.
If you really want Leonie
to be better off,
then maybe you have to try
to do things differently with her
than the way things were done with you.
Then you won't run away.
Then you'll stick around
and clean up your mess.
And be there for her, once and for all.
[Octa sighs softly]
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Thank you.
- [mom] Do you wanna take something to eat?
We have a door, you know!
[indistinct chatter]

[phone chimes]
- Call Paul.
- [female voice] Calling Paul.
- [phone chimes]
- Hey.
- I'm going to the shelter after all.
- Animal shelter? At this time?
[Octa] They told me they'd be there.
Maybe I'll keep the cat myself.
Okay, and... and when will you be there?
- A couple of minutes.
- I'm gonna head over there now too.
- [phone chimes]
- [panting]
- [chime]
- [Octa] Call Rico.
- [female voice] Calling Rico.

Octa.
Please don't take this personally, okay?
- You know how these things go.
- I have an offer for your people.
I'm listening.
I know where Chino will be
in a few minutes.
Where?
How do I know
your people will leave me alone?
- They only want Chino.
- They almost just killed me.
- Well, you did ditch the fight, man.
- I didn't know the fight was rigged.
Really, huh?
All right, I'll deal with it.
But now just tell me
where the fuck Chino is.
He's not far.
- I'll send you the address in ten minutes.
- Why...

[Octa] Hey!
Open up!
We're closed.
It's ten to six.
[man] On your watch maybe.
- What?
- On your watch maybe!
I have a cat to pick up.
Not today. We're closed.
It'll only be two minutes. Come on.
Sure. You know how long it usually takes
for a family to pick up a cat?
They look around.
They look again. They think about it.
- They think some more.
- Do I look like a family?
I don't know who else you've got with you.
You can see I'm here by myself.
If you pick up a cat now, that's gonna
leave me with tons of paperwork.
I'll have to clean up, put shit away.
All that stuff.
I don't wanna do all that now.
- Just open the fucking door!
- Tomorrow, I said. Thanks.

[policeman] Sir, we're gonna need names,
an address,
and all the information you have.
It's the animal shelter. 8 Donau Street.
- [policeman] Okay, who am I speaking to?
- [man sighs]
[Octa] They're dangerous and armed.
[policeman] Sir, where did you get
this information?
Send as many cops as you can.
[policeman] Sir, if you want us
to send over a patrol car, we will.
But I need you to tell me where you got
this information. What is your...
One car is not enough. You're gonna need
an entire SWAT team.
- You got that?

Okay, just stay cool. Be sensible, dude.

Run and your buddy gets
a bullet in the head.
Get over there.
Go!
[snaps]
- [Chino grunts]
- [Octa groans]
- I'm sorry, man.
- Shut your stupid fucking mouth!
[Octa sighs]
The two of you are my whores from now on.
I know everything about your families,
and if you actually give
a shit about them,
then both of you will bend over for me
every fucking day from now on!
Do you have any idea what Danica will do
to us if she doesn't get her money?
A couple of fights here and there
ain't gonna cover it!
The three of us are in business
for all eternity,
and it's gonna stay that way
until I say so.
- Are we fucking clear?
- [gunshot]

- [Chino] Go! Move your fucking asses!
Get over there. Fast!

Chino's over there!
Shoot!

[Chino] Kick the door in!

Was that you?

- Relax.
[sirens wailing]
[tires screech]
It's okay. Just stay calm, man.
Everything's gonna be okay.
- [Octa] Chino, there's no point now.

What the fuck am I gonna do?
[Paul] Just stay calm, all right?
- Put down the gun.
- You fucked me over.
- Put the gun down and just take off.
- Relax.
- You fuck me over, Bergmann?
- No, man.
- Did you fuck me over?
- No, man.
