The sun hides behind the mountains.
While leaving the forest, the light projected long shadows...
...in the sweet sound of the forest, turtles resonated along the view.
The smell of flowers slowly invaded the forest.
The spring...created thousands of small life occupied all around...
...over the green branches of trees, over the swamps, inside the coves, including the rotten holes of old trees and roots.
Aren't they cute?
They will be strong foxes with strong teeth.
That is because they have a very good mother.
On your side, Raposo, it is evident that I am a good mother.
Look! What a smart one!
He is liveliest one, runs on his veins the blood of his grandpa.
You are right, it is undoubtedly the most astute of the family.
We could call him Vuk, like his grandpa.
Vuk?
Leave! And they left his way, that is why they called him Vuk, by the great hunter.
One day, small one, I am sure they will all leave your way.
VUK
Written by Ištvana Fekete
Do not touch my ear!
Stop it mommy!
What is going on? Why are you fighting?
He is always biting my ear!
You are such a crybaby! Want to stop coward?
Stop it! Do not fight anymore.
But you do not understand, he is biting my ear mommy!
Stop for today!
Let's all go to sleep.
One, two, three...
Vuk! Quick son!
I'm going.
Why we have to sleep too soon?
We like to play..
Come on.
Do not complain, you too should sleep.
Raposo, I believe you should go hunt.
Yes, you are right, it is time to go.
You know that the first thing they want in the morning is food.
Yes I will go soon.
What should I bring? A goose or a duck?
Goose! Duck!
And a rooster!
Ah, gluttony kid.
Bring anything, but be careful.
The important is to return home safe and sound.
Where dad is going?
He went hunting, and hunting is...
...sleep quicker.
Mommy what is to hunt?
Hunting is something dangerous, now Vuk, you must sleep.
I am worried Raposo, take care.
Do not worry; I know how to take care of my own.
I will take care of daddy's skin.
.. he goes hunting gooses, ducks and a rooster too.
A dog! A dog! He is here Raposo, take care, there is a dog around!
Look, one of these days I will swallow you.
Yeah, yeah! Swallow you!
I will swallow you too!
You better try!
You are nothing but a dumb kid!
You are dumb! I am Vuk, and very valiant.
What you are doing here?
Me?
I am going to hunt with you...
Hunt? That is just what I needed. We are going to hunt!
To hunt? Ouch I think I will die laughing.
Get down the tree if you are a man!
Birds do not walk.
They only fly, Vuk, only fly, and do it quickly.
We fly, fly, goodbye!
How do they do?
The same way we walk.
Can I fly?
Go home, your mother must be searching you...
But then, who will take care of your skin?
Do not worry, I know how to take care myself.
Now go!
Pop, let me go with you...
I am not telling you twice! Now go!
Heh, want to hunt huh?
Indeed, he has his grandfather's blood.
It is not fair.
I am Vuk, and I will hunt, and I will scare them from my path.
... and actually I have to walk away.
Look! A wriggling stone.
And it bounces.
It is time for me to hunt.
It walks funny. Bumps like it was jumping on bed.
Wait a moment?
That thing that approaches is a relative?
Or not? Is it a frog or a fox?
It is a fox!
Help!
I am going to get you coward!
Aha!
Walked into the water that is your home!
Where you have gone must come out again.
Then I will eat you!
Look, all you have to do is just cluck.
Got it?
Or else the fox will not come.
Just cluck, cluck, cluck. Cluck the strong as you can.
Then get the fox.
What a stupid rooster, 
didn't you get it?
How can I explain that, it is precisely what I want.
I want you to call him into the trap. Got it?
but, but...
If he comes, he eats me.
He eats me, he eats me...
Bullshit!
Why am I here?
Tell me why am I here?
Speak!
You do not know, true?
I will tell you, I will take care of you, will help you.
Got it?
Now come on you must cluck.
No, no, not like that!
Give it more strength, more will, you are calm, do not suspect anything.
What? Suspect what?
Never mind!
Cluck with more will, more strength.
Will!
Strength!
Is it better?
Yes, do not stop!
Cluck, cluck, clulussal!
Cluck, cluck, oh my Marin, what a sweet voice.
Marin is ours, if you don't mind.
But he is indeed clu cluck clulussal.
Go, continue clucking!
Is Marin calling?
I am coming, you stupid rooster, have patience.
Um? I have never been here.
Slowly Raposo.
Maybe there is a dog watching the house.
Dogs are infamous animals, including that they lick human hands.
Hmpf, it is just a window.
He is here, coming close.
Quiet, quiet!
Hey, was not what I thought?
It seems that Marin and Eary is waiting me.
What you think am I?
He is coming, coming!
Quiet, quiet!
What is going on? Where is he?
I can not see him!
Oh Marin, just a minute and
where is him?
Oh hey Eary!
You are a traitor!
You are a disgrace for all the free species!
Há! You are here!
I will take care of you now. You will see.
Run with him Eary, run with him!
Bite his neck, miserable!
Bite him!
Got stuck on the fence, stupid.
Paws everywhere! I hope to have strength to reach the river.
I can leave now,
He has a great tracking, but his head is empty.
I hope he gets tired searching.
Weird, I lost his track.
But it was here I last saw him.
Help Eary!
They took my Marin.
OUR Marin, darling.
Oh, Raposo tricked me.
He did not cross the river, and returned to pick Marin up.
Hey people! Did you hear the news?
What? What happened?
The smart tricked our friend Eary!
Ear is too selfish.
He never barks at us, he thinks he is too important.
Always snooty, well done!
Why he has a nose?
Without tracking?
It's too bad.
Raposo was here!
What a disgrace!
He took my Marin.
Our Marin!
My repute down the sink, goodbye my pride.
Hello, hello, Eary!
Blimey! Hairy! That is what I needed.
They just told me about the great chase.
Oh yeah, sure.
The great chase. I have seen it, it was the Mottley.
Mottley that vagabond dog.
Oh yeah, oh if it wasn't Mottley that followed Raposo?
He runs like a soulless.
Did you say he was Mottley?
Mottley?
Oh yeah, I have seen it myself.
But, you know. He is a vagabond after all.
And disgraced Raposo tricked him.
Oh, Marin where are you?
Raposo picked our Marin.
Ours darling.
Shut! It's a sad story.
The fact is, Mottley was left behind.
It is the pure truth! But if he had called me, I would have gotten him.
You know, hunting is my job.
But Mottley is too proud, and wanted to hunt himself.
Now, if they ask anything. Tell them that you know nothing.
Mottley is a friend mine.
And I do not want that he thinks I am talking on his back.
You can trust me, you know that I will not spread the word.
Do not know me?
Yes, that's because I know you,
I spoke to you Hairy.
Know everything?
Everything.
And what happened between Raposo and Mottley?
Who told you?
Raposo, they say that his career is incredible!
And he never called Eary to help him.
It's ridiculous.
Mottley is too arrogant.
However Eary is very valiant.
Poor Mottley, he is not even here.
His name was delevelled into the mud.
Hmm look, an unnoticed bunny.
Umm.. A man,
and with a dog.
Got to run, but what did I do with the rooster?
He has a great track.
He found the rooster.
I must save my skin.
Hmpf, look at this?
I shot a bunny,
Where did you find that, Mottley?
Gee, if it is not the rooster from Izgleda corral.
Better check up.
I am sure there is a fox somewhere.
He must be hidden around here.
Let's search, search!
Don't want to get out stone?
Well, the other day I will hunt you, now that I know where you are.
Jumping stone, Humpf.
Ooo it's morning already!
Pop must be back home!
They will punish me for walking around.
Ahm? This is bad!
I am scared!
He is gone! Father is gone with the human.
But why did he leave?
They will return to pick me up.
I am sure they will return for me.
If they are going to punish me I do not care anymore.
I just want them back soon.
Ahm?
Many ducks!
I am small, alone and hungry.
Hmm? a duck!
Its meat is very good,
Mommy would be very happy!
It is a duck, but it is too big for me.
I am alone, I am small and I am hungry.
Help me, please, I am just a small cub.
Hi cub, who is your father?
I am son of Raposo.
But I am very small and I am hungry.
Come close Vuk, son of Raposo.
How did you escape?
Me? I did not escape, I was lost.
I went walking the forest, but my family was waiting me..
And they will come pick me up.
Poor cub, he does not know... Your mother will not come back.
Mommy can't come back?
No.
But she sent me.
My name is Karak, I am your uncle.
You must follow me, can you walk?
Sure! Run too!
But I have never gone too far.
Then follow me.
Come on cub,
hurry!
What are you waiting for?
And the duck?
We are not taking it?
Which duck?
The one that fell from the sky! It's there!
It must be your imagination, Vuk, There is no duck there.
My tracking is not bad.
But I use my nose and I will show you where it is.
Because I am too hungry.
Well, let's go then. But I say that there is no duck around.
Umm, you have a good tracking sense.
Indeed there is your grandfather blood on you, Vuk.
I picked up the scent from the hills, but I wanted to see of you could smell it.
Let me go thru.
You can come now, here is your duck.
Heh. Is it all you left for me?
Are you tired?
Want to rest a bit?
I live near here.
Climb is too difficult.
How would you like to climb?
With the head down, like a bird.
But I do not know how to fly.
It is not necessary, I will carry you.
Take care!
You will not let me fall, will you?
Answer me!
Are you muted Karak?
Of course not, if I opened my mouth you would fall there.
Ah, I didn't think of that.
I am so dumb.
Am I dumb Karak?
No, you are not, however you have too much to learn, Vuk.
We are home now.
Karak!
Speak little Vuk.
I like it here.
But now I am too sleepy.
Well, sleep then.
Here you are safe, here no one can reach.
Not even the human, who hunts us and eat us.
Not even Eary who sold his soul to help the humans to hunt.
Sleep well,
because I have many things to do.
You are going to hunt?
Yes I am hungry.
Then you should ask me: what should I bring home, a goose or a duck?
Father always asked: what should I bring home? 
Sure, little.
What should I bring home? A goose or a duck?
A goose!
A duck!
and a rooster too!
Also a rooster?
Now sleep little Vuk, sleep.
What is this sound?
Some stomach is wriggling.
and I am too hungry.
I think it is my stomach that is making the noise!
What is that?
Karak!
It is... It flies and flies very well.
What a nice smell.
Karak!
This has a good smell.
Don't you agree?
Come on wake up Karak!
Do not sleep that much,
I am hungry and I want to hunt!
Calm down Vuk, calm down.
We will hunt.
Be patient.
It is not the time yet.
It is time for me!
It is time to hunt.
And I want to go hunt now.
I say no.
Calm down little one...
Look, you have too much to learn, Vuk.
A fox sleeps while is day, regains strength.
And when is night, goes to hunt.
Did you understand?
Yes, yes.
But if it is day and I want to go hunt, what that means?
That I am not a true fox?
Of course you are,
Come on do not think simple questions.
Now stop bugging me with stupid questions and sleep.
Yes, go, go...
When it is dark, can I go hunt?
Hey do not be angry! I am not hunting, we foxes only hunt at night.
Hey Karak, these birds are harassing me.
If you do not let me sleep,
I will punish you.
Let me sleep, what a thing.
You must not be afraid of those birds,
they just have this high pitched voice, there is nothing that can be done.
Now sleep Vuk, you do not want to see me mad.
All right, don't say a thing, I will be quiet.
Hmpf, what now?
Stop making noises, I want to sleep.
Did you say something Karak?
Can you repeat if you don't mind?
I said!...
Only said to sleep Vuk,
Come on please, sleep, sleep, sleep...
To him it is easy because he is sleepy.
Do not tickle me, let me sleep!
All right you asked for it!
I will show you that you should not harass foxes.
We must sleep at the day!
This flower tastes bad, it is too sour!
That flying thing must taste much better.
But it is not time to hunt yet.
Oh! Look a gecko!
I am sure that geckos do not know that foxes must sleep at daylight.
A fox! And awake at this time! You fool!
You are fool! Disgusting.
-Karak! Karak!
Karak was right, can not hunt by the day.
He is going to punish me,
But the guilty is the gecko.
He provoked me and now I can't climb up.
Karak?
What a troublesome cub.
Karak?
You warned me, I am sorry.
I will not punish you Vuk.
Really?
Yes, you have learned a lesson. A fox must know how to control yourself.
You can not put yourself in danger for too little, we foxes are too smart.
Got it?
Guess so Karak.
I would like to learn every lesson you have:
I must sleep at the day, control hunger, but do not be angry with me.
Are you not angry for wasting your time with me?
I am not angry, Vuk, and to prove it do you know what are we going to do?
We are going to hunt!
Bravo, bravo! We hunt!
Karak and Vuk are going to hunt!
Karak and Vuk are going to hunt!
Be scared geckoes, deer! All the animals in the forest be scared because we are going to hunt!
Shut up, do not scream that much, to hunt you must let no one hear.
Silence is the feed, and food is our life.
You will learn later Vuk, that you will learn too.
Teach me everything about hunt, Karak.
Come here.
Let's see if you remember what I said before, who is the best hunting fox friend?
The best friend of a fox, I think, the best friend is this.
Come on, don't be stupid.
Sorry, Karak,
It was a joke.
You are a great hunter, Karak. Soon I will be one too.
You will, you will. but now, answer me.
The best friend of a hunting fox is the darkness.
Very well, you have learned, now we shall hunt.
Karak!
Pst!
Karak!
Now what, Vuk?
It is three.
Three what?
I learn three things!
Sleep at the day, control hunger and stay silent.
No, it is four, because the darkness is our best friend.
I remember everything, Karak.
With the darkened it is four.
Where are you going Vuk?
Now that I learn four things, I am going to hunt.
To hunt, to hunt, but how? How would you do Vuk?
You must lift your paws very carefully, like I do.
Remember to never mane any sound,
Slip slowly like a shadow.
A shadow? Like a shadow?
Now you try.
Well, how I do? Like a shadow should I decide things like a shadow?
You got it, now follow me.
Pardon, sorry.
Before we go, I would like to know a thing, Vuk.
Am I taking you to hunt or you are taking me to hunt?
You are taking me to hunt. I guess.
Then pay attention to the smell, and hear the wind.
Smell and wind.
How do you know from where it comes?
It blows, doesn't it?
I... I see from where it blows.
You must see from where it blows, and where your smell goes,
Do not let the one that you follow know that you approach before you.
Five! with the smell it is five!
Five?
Sleep at the day, control hunger, walk in silence...
...and the darkness is our best friend, and from where to where blows the wind.
It is five already, any other?
I smell something! I will get it, now I know how to hunt!
What did you find?
A prey!
And what more?
You must learn several things kid.
Do not spend your time with a porcupine.
What did you call me?
His meat is too expensive.
What else?
When it feels danger it curls up into a ball that is all splinters.
And is impossible to touch.
Yes sir I must say.
And if we take from above?
Come on try!
It would be a nice bite, can reach it but can do nothing.
Come on tough guy try it! Show me a paw!
Are not enough all those splinters on your snout?
Yes it is, all right.
If I had time I would push you around.
You are too lazy. Hmpf, push me around.
Wait me Karak!
Do not run like that!
Did not I tell you to walk like a shadow?
Yes you told me, sorry.
Your Ears must feel the slightest sound.
I will try to do what you say Karak.
Now go, I am hungry too.
Psst! I smell something!
There! Didn't you notice?
A mew! A cat.
Abandoned the town and wants to live with us, who are free.
It's a bastard, but his flesh is good.
But his claws do too much damage.
I have seen a fox hurt by his claws already,
The cat is a very dangerous enemy.
Maybe it is looking for a nest.
They live on nests?
Of course not!
they look for nests of birds to rip their feathers off.
But it is possible that he is spying for something.
Why you stare at me little auburn?
Did I do something? Are you s spy? Never seen a cat?
Then look at me, look at my claws, they are long and curled!
You should go listen to them every time you find a cat.
But I think I walked like a shadow.
Yes, but you let it see your eyes.
Your eyes shone.
It is not my fault,
my eyes always shine even when I do not want.
Do not worry, Vuk the cat is definitely atop the tree.
I am sure it will not come down before the morning.
But remember, every time you go closer to your prey,
you must close your eyes.
If I close my eyes, I cannot see.
You must see with your nose.
If you open your eyes, every one will see you.
and if they notice you, you will have nothing to eat.
and if you do not have anything to eat...
Better you stop talking about that.
If you do not have anything to eat, you will end up like the snake.
I do not want to be slim.
Then take care.
I already have...uh.
Do not give up, if you miss the first chance try again, you will do better.
Who is this?
Oh! Look, he let his eyes shine when he looks at me.
What does he say, Karak? Who is this guy?
What a good food.
It is Hu the Owl with big eyes.
Did you hear?
He said that he at very well.
He looks and says huhu.
and eats the others even if they walk like shadows...
...we are silent and have a friend that is the darkness, nevertheless we have to control hunger.
Karak! Isn't him dangerous?
Nothing to be afraid of,
because he only eats mice.
You can leave him huhuing, and he is not hungry.
Speak of me, you big noisy and funny charlatans. 
Actually, you can distrust him.
He has long beak, and very pointy claws.
I would like to make him fall from the tree.
Come on, do not waste time.
It will soon be morning.
Nham, this is just what I needed, things that make an insupportable noise. What a night.
Let's go where the frogs live.
You can show me everything that you have learned.
Frog meat is delicious.
Even if they are a bit small, isn't true?
What is that? What smell is this?
This is human scent.
And that is his house. Lives there.
You should never get near his house.
Hear me well, this is the most important lesson.
Even more than hearing the wind?
The most important one Vuk,
The one that killed your family,
What?
Was it a human...
who entered my den...
...and took away may brothers and parents?
Yes it was a human.
Have you ever been at his house?
Not me or any other of the fox kind.
There are dogs and the human walks around with a branch...
...which shoots beams because they can not hear well or see.
But they believe that everything in the world belongs to them.
Hear me human, hear me.
One day you shall pay for everything you have done to my family.
And will pay an expensive price.
It is a promise.
Come on little one, go hunt frogs.
I will watch you from here, to see what you have learned.
If you have any problem, shout. I will be here.
If you do not want meee. I want you!
I am veerrryyy happy.
Oh did I say, happy?
They want to eat me!
Oh? A duck?
Oh? I will then sing for my frog lady.
If you do not want meee...
I want yooou. Oh yeah I want you.
I think it's been long already.
Where is that cub?
Should have fallen in the water.
Take care Karak,
This little cub will put you in a river, and I do not have age for that.
He will soon learn.
The important is that he is trying.
Gotcha!
In the end, the little Vuk hunted a delicious duck!
What do you search here? Didn't you hear me you delinquent? What finds here?
Who are you? What you want?
Did not hear what I asked?
Answer, do not be mute!
Here is my hunting territory!
Who gave you permission to hunt here?
Vuk, I am Vuk, son of Raposo.
I will not give you the duck, because I hunted it, he is mine! I hunted it!
Will not give me? Well hear me delinquent!
If you do not get out of here now, I will eat you whole, got it?
RUN!
Uh.. eh.. Gee?
You... you are son of Raposo, right?
It is a pleasure to meet you, son of Raposo, and grandson of Vuk.
You must be little Vuk.
Yes
I should have noticed.
It is the little Vuk, nephew of the proud Karak.
Karak which I respect much... Even if I do not respect no one.
Is it true that Karak taught you to hunt? Of course it is...
This is your territory too...
I was just passing by, I am leaving already.
You are very kind.
Please, if you see Karak, tell him that I will visit him someday, he he doesn't mind.
Get out of here, before I get mad.
If I didn't see you, I am sure you would grief Vuk.
ow, get out.
You are going to pay me Karak!
Hear me well scarred, old toothless, may the cats rip your skin off!
May the ravens beak your eyes out, shameless!
Ahm um arr arr arrogant! Impertinent!
What a bad fall.
You did very well little  Vuk!
You protected your duck!
Because it is mine, I hunted it.
Very well, what you wait for? You hunted it, you share it.
This is for you, the rest for me.
Are you ok with the head?
you said to share, this is how I share.
Its okay little Vuk.
One day you will be the best of all,
When the day arrives, do not forget your old Karak.
Think on me sometimes.
I did think on you, right!
Yes, little Vuk, thank you.
The summer did not take too long to come. the vegetation that grew in the spring, mellowed with the heat,
Sprouted and gave fruits,
Along with Karak, Vuk grew up physically and acquired much experience.
Along with his uncle, walked all the fields covered with flower scent and fields around.
Pay attention, Mottley.
The swallow have seen something, maybe they are warning the presence of a fox.
Patience, anyway they will be here tomorrow.
And we will be ready to catch him.
Well, Vuk. What a nice burrow you found here for the summer.
Here we will be in peace, the human will not grief us.
It was time Karak,
to find a new home,
yours did not give us any second of peace,
because of those impertinent bouncing bugs.
Vuk! Where you go?
Tell me what you want to do?
I would like to walk the field if you are okay, uncle. I do not know the area.
Okay, but be careful.
Avoid the human house.
Did you hear about the branch that emits beams?
Vuk!
Wait a moment, did you hear what I just said?
Yes boss, perfectly.
I will follow your advice, and I will be very careful.
Do not run from me little bird. What a small bird like you are doing down here?
Small little bird, do not run!
I will reach you.
Soon to be mine!
Do not run bird!
Why you are scared? I am your friend! Is this what you do with me?
Do not be afraid, fool
I only want to hug you and give some bites, very sweetly
Let me hug you,
Do not do this to me.
It will not hurt a thing, I will open my mouth and swallow you whole.
Of course it doesn't hurt. Why would it, bird?
Ahhhh! Help! How can you do this to the great eagle?
To stalk a defenseless bird like me! Miserable, how dare you pull three most pretty feathers from my tail?
You will pay for that! I will make the dogs run for you, all of them!
I will send everything against you!
My precious tail feathers.
What you think you are?
Aha, then this is the famous house...
Which makes tremble old Karak?
Where that delicious bird came from.
And you stinky, you think you get fat because you want?
What you do inside?
Are you friend of the human?
No, no.
Don't you feel ashamed? Don't you like to live free?
The house is risky! Why are you here?
Why you say that?
Do not offend me, they forced me here, it was a long time ago, I was little.
Why you do not leave here? Why are you still here?
I tried. I tried to gnaw the bars, but it is not wood like the old cages.
Poor thing.
Do not go, do not go away, please.
At least I could see someone from the same species. Stay please.
I can not,
My uncle Karak is waiting me, I will talk to him...
You can not leave me here, now that I met you...
I can not stay here anymore.
I got to go, really. I will be back tonight.
My uncle Karak is very smart, he will find a solution.
Really?
Promise me that you will return tonight?
Do not be afraid, my uncle will help us.
He is very smart and crafty.
Until the night vixen!
Ear! Mottley!
Come on enter while you are not cold!
You both are wet!
Damned be this storm. You! Out go watch the house.
Do you think I should watch the house?
Out, go! Before I get angry, hurry!
Did you see that? Are they humans? What a shame.
To the hairy it is not permitted to enter the house. The way he is stupid, it is not strange.
This shows his fidelity, if he had learned how to hunt, he would not be on the rain.
Do you know what we are going to do is madness?
We are risking our skin.
Let us go quick, are you afraid, uncle?
Yes, I am afraid.
A sensate fox would not face the dogs.
I promised Karak, It is a promise.
Go on, I would not ever risk my own skin for that.
Do not forget it.
I won't, I wish you to know that my prey is yours Karak. Including when you are very old.
First we must get old, Vuk.
Finally, you came, I waited too much.
This is Karak, please do not listen do me uncle.
I think he is the most valiant, smart and crafty of all foxes. I have never met anyone better, and I have learned everything from him.
Hey, what is your name? I don't even know your name.
Enough kids. Leave it for later, we have to make this quick, before the storms end.
Vuk, stay alert for anyone that approaches.
You start from inside.
Hurry
Hey, why the much noise? Can't be any noisier? than a train?
I can't my nails won't even scratch.
It is clear were you done grown up. Poor child. Try again.
Vuk!
Continue here, I must rest a bit.
We have a problem Karak, it is also closed from under, it is impossible gnaw it.
Are you going to leave me here?
Oh please Karak, use your head, and try to find a solution quick it is urgent!
What you ask from me is impossible! It is too hard we could break our teeth.
Break teeth!
Break! That's it, we must break the damned cage.
Vuk, wait, Vuk, what are you going to do? Hey are you crazy? What you want to do with that?
I want to release the cart.
Stay behind!
Yes, Yes.
Move, Karak!
There it goes!
By all the gods, what was that?
The storm made them too nervous!
Calm down, enough!
Why are you guys this furious?
Quiet!
I do not know how to thank you for what you have done.
Thanks, many thanks, I will never, never forget.
Thank Vuk, and only him.
Do not listen to me Vuk,
I wish to tell you that it's been long that around here no one was born as smart and astute as Vuk. Remember him, always.
I will never forget.
And the education given by the old Karak.
Yes Mr. sure, now you need to rest.
Vixy would you like to live with us?
Can she live with us, Karak?
Naturally, there is space for the three of us.
But now let's sleep, we are very tired. We deserve some rest.
Sleep well.
Many thanks for everything, you too Vuk. Sleep well.
The show will start now. You will pay, little friend, my vengeance approaches.
It was a pity messing with me, and I am very mad.
Look if it is not three foxes instead of one. They will pay thrice times for pulling my three feathers!
What a pity, so yummy, wait for the banquet.
Search, search, and go find them Mottley! Search Eary!
I will find this fox, yeah I will.
He is coming, oh the great hunter, the chief hunter.
It is a pity, a pity that he was home today.
And now you will all lose your skin miserable foxes. This will be a bloody summer!
Come here doggies, search, and search!
They are here under this bush!
Mottley, Eary, quiet!
I think I found the den.
This noise will make them run from their hiding.
Quiet Eary, observe.
I am scared.
We return to the forest, with this noise we can run without being noticed. Get ready.
Wait, could be dangerous.
We have no choice. If we jump now, one after another we have chance, one of us will escape.
I am afraid, how do we do?
Wait, I will look forward.
Vuk! Take care!
Those pointy Ears, the little red.
It will not take long now, oh delicious scene.
Hey, where you go? Do not run coward!
On the forest a human awaits us, we must escape from there!
It can't be Vuk, the noise come from there.
I am afraid, Vuk!
Karak, I know you are the eldest, the smartest, and wisest. And I am too young but you must trust me. Follow me.
Well
Try to escape disgraced!
Look! A fox, two, three!
Let's get em!
Take care, they bite!
Get em!
They escaped there! Get them!
Enormous, I have never seen them around!
Mr. hunter, Mr. hunter! Chief Hunter!
Shoot, shoot quick! What you wait for? Shoot! Damn, he has a shotgun but sleeps all the time!
Demons, who would think they would follow the noise?
I knew it, I knew it, and he would do shit and...
end my delicious scene.
a vengeance scene. Ouch!
Hey! Are you mad? Do not point that thing to me! Assassin! Help, help, help!
You are an adult, It is finally time, there is no Fox out there that do not know your name and say it without great respect. You are the owner of yourself.
If you want to follow us or follow your own path only you can decide.
What should I do?
Why you ask me? You know very well.
Yes, I do not need to waste time we continue no more talking about it. If you don't mind.
Ah Vuk!
Three is worth more than one, did not tell you? My prey is also yours, agree Karak?
Naturally, Vuk.
Why you stare at us like that?
Nothing... it is nothing. But is so cute you both together...
Now, let's go, walking young ones.
The same way the spring came and turned into summer, the autumn entered slowly between the trees of the forest. And yellow leaves slowly started to fall from the branches leaving them naked.
What once had been a protective forest is not a place to hide for the foxes anymore.
Do not hide chicken stealers, do not hide!
Get out of here! Get out of your den! We will kill everything!
Go Eary! Find them and get them!
Yes, follow the track!
Go away from here! You cannot escape!
You are surrounded!
Get out of our forest!
Come, quick, run, run, do not make any noise.
Here, there, the path is free. Quick!
Not here Karak!
It is late now, they have us surrounded, but maybe...
Follow me, come, quick!
The man will make you leave your hiding!
Here! Here! We can hide here, here they won't find us. We wait, we can not run.
I knew it, I felt it, and it was long since I knew it would happen.
Out from the bushes!
Run?
No, not yet!
You were right we three can not escape, we do not have many choices.
Karak, pay me attention, I know I am younger than you, but listen to me, please.
There a man is waiting for us with a branch that shoots beams if we run we are dead, but if we hide... and not move... maybe they will not feel our presence. Maybe not.
Hey, listen to me, the fox is hiding in that bush!
Appear!
Do not escape!
We found  the den!
No, wait!
He ran! Why did he jump? Why?
Poor thing couldn't reach the fall.
Do not move, there are more people around. Stand still.
Did you hit it?
But of course, this one will not steal my chickens!
It will be difficult to climb from down there.
I do not want to lose an arm or leg just to eat him.
Let the crows finish him.
Yes, you are right.
Ah, you are here, anything happened?
Did the human hit you badly?
You do not look very well.
I took a nice bite from that branch of fire. It will soon pass. But now I am too tired Vuk.
Why did you do that, Karak? Why?
Do not ask me, on my place you would do the same. There was no other way, and you know it very well.
If none of us had run they would find us all and everyone would be dead by now.
And you would not be living right now.
But Karak...
Shut up, please Vuk, you, you still have many things to do.
Karak was hit by humans, but the foxes must continue living on liberty. We must never disappear.
Look Vuk, try to live on my Den. It is a safe place.
After all it has a lot of space...
Karak! Karak!
Karak is gone, Vuk.
Damned be the human, Damned be!
Come, Vuk he wanted us to live at his den.
Listen to me moon, you that appear on the night and disappears, listen to what I will say.
Let’s go hunny...
There will be a day, when human will grief for what he has done.
Now we can leave darling.
Eheheh! I have fresh Tuesday news!
There are lots of gossips on the area, come on tell me now!
Tell, tell, tell! What happened this time with the hunter's hunting?
Imagine the smart Vuk, running around stealing from Eary!
What did this devilish fox steal now?
The lil vixen in the cage!
And freed her in front of his nose!
Last week he took the three best egg layer chickens.
And now the furry rabbit.
Vuk will end up ruining the hunter!
Ear followed him until the dawn, but he didn't follow Vuk!
What did he follow?
Probably his owner?
No, it was Mottley, probably confused him with Vuk!
Stop it, stop it, I can not handle anymore, I will die laughing!
Now the best, between chases, while Eary chase Mottley, Vuk took three chickens and three ducks.
Vuk eat all the hennery and thanks to the good tracking of Eary!
Then Eary is now the sponsor of Vuk!
What a headache, I can not endure such load!
What hell is going with the dogs to be like that?
Man! Bring the eggs!
I am going, just a moment!
Hurry man!
Hmpf, what impatience.
By the demons! The fox again!
How did he break in! How did he enter?
Disgraced, miserable!
Why do I have you? Not even to watch!
You are useless! The fox come and goes as he wishes!
By all the demons! He has been here too!
He returned to empty my hennery again!
What a banquet he must had, took all my chickens!
What a silence, I do not like it!
The worms eat your skin damned! You took all of them! Including the eldest one!
The two goose too!
And I had a customer for them.
What a disgrace lord, what a disgrace!
Look fellow, you who are sober than I, know where is coming from all this scandal?
Tell the truth, I do not know I only know what others say
They say that we are...we are... I did not hear
What were we speaking?
Mate, it is like my cousin duck always say,
We are like gooses, and we always live down the water and... plus... which...
Oh yeah, we always open our mouth and speak nothing interesting.
What you say about singing some?
Dooo not open your mouth
Because you are tooo empty...
Good to see that you are safe, but it seems
That you are both drunk, have you been at the winery?
Did you drink gas?
Maybe they are lucky, can't hunt this condemned fox.
Let's go boys, let's go to your place.
I do not care that they take me, at the moment I can not stand on my feet, he is strangling me with his hand, can't breath!
Ear, Mottley, come here! Listen to me, this is the last goose that left me if they disappear, I will finish you both.
I heard you boss, stay tranquil. This goes for you too Mottley, he says about the gooses, did you get it?
On other words, if these two disappear, I will turn you into a couch!
Understood?
Mate we turned into very important characters. There are two special guards for us, and I will ask the guards to carry out your order, yes sir! and watch me well.
Sing again lovely mate!
It seems that she is, she will pay the price, when gets the cat...
I am number one
And I number two
A goose, plus two gooses are... three gooses!
Silence!
The arrested must not make any manifestation loudly, understood?
Then we will sing lowly, what you think of the children song...
The garden of my house...
Silent!
... had a path...
What indignity!
Indignity is not the correct word.
I am a hunter dog, and put to watch two gooses.
you are selfish, only think on yourself, do you  think I am born to watch gooses?
Serious now, it is not the time, did not you hear what he said? If the gooses are gone...
I heard, of course, but what is a couch?
Oh lord, help me please! Two drunken gooses and a stupid helper.
I will organize the guard. The first mission is to watch the drunken gooses, recruiting the best two dogs, I mean I am the only best dog here.
What's up with this prison? Smelled like alcohol, well makes part of the mission.
Let's see, two dogs, a smart one and a stupid. Number one is the smart one, which is me and I will watch the goose on the right, and the task for the number two...
Who is that?
For all the angels, think a bit!
I said I am the number one, then who is the number two?
Is it me?
Yes! Now take care of the left goose.
Halt! The prisoners should not move!
What rude! Do not scream with me!
Calm, calm Gasper, and do not hear him.
If there is any problem Gaston, if they are are im impertinent, and speak foul words, better sleep.
Finally.
I smell fox.
Do not think I did not notice? Watch the goose.
I ask permission to inform you...
I know very well that it is a bone.
Ear, something is meddling under the floor...
This miserable, I would like to know what he is intending.
Look! He is above us now.
Shut up, do not annoy me, I am on a mission. This is exactly what he wants. Got it?
Oh! Did you hear the noise of something being ripping?
No, no sir, this bastard did not make it, we still have both of the prisoners. Where is Mottley?
I am here, where is Eary?
Number two, correct me if I am wrong, after what happened here, we should seek another job.
Must be quick boss, you still didn't say what is a couch.
There is no time for that, now run, quick!
Hear the last news!
Tell me now!
Ear ran away! Abandoned his job and Mottley too!
How long did they take to rebel? Seems a lot.
What the two disgraced will do now?
It is a delicate question, leaving the job at this age.
They will wander, stray! It is sad to end like a stray dog, not telling the price of it.
Did you hear what they say about the wheat-covered dogs?
Wait a moment fox, these traps will get you.
Found anything?
A snail.
I didn't know you liked French cuisine.
And you what did you find?
A frog, but it jumped away...
I doubted you liked frog legs.
Let's go to the lake, maybe we will find a nest of wild ducks.
I always liked your bright ideas. Go!
I smell roasted meat!
No, no. It is prohibited, roasted meat is for the man! It is not allowed to us!
On emergency situations, there are other rules. And it is clear that this is an emergency situation. Let's go!
Finally! The fox is mine!
What? You again? What are you doing here? Damned!
Augh! Who the hell put this stupid thing here?
Look! He is the smartest one!
How strong!
He is very lively!
Will we be okay here, Vuk?
What did Karak say when he left the den for us?
He said... it was very safe.
And very spacious...
He was not wrong, right, Vuk?
