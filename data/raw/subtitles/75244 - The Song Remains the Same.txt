"Jack lifted the lid of the great stone oven
and dropped inside.
"From his hiding place
he heard a mighty rumbling voice.
"Fee, fie, foe, fum.
"I smell the blood of an Englishman.
"Be he alive or be he dead.
"I'll grind his bones to make my bread!"
Whoa, pony!
Hello, love.
What have you got?
Peter called while you were out.
He left this for you.
Tour dates.
This is tomorrow...
Good evening.
The Song Remains The Same.
It's fucking true!
It comes only suddenly inside the building.
No, no, man. You know, one of those...
- Are they good?
- No, they're fucking terrible!
Those photos.
- Not again.
- They're very sexual.
I think we ought to be part of it.
When you give him a call, nobody knows.
This is a song
that sometimes takes a building...
...in a manner which our forefathers
were very used to.
Did you hear that?
It's right though, isn't it?
That feeling that's left everybody.
The cosmic energy!
Everybody cheers.
Jimmy Page, guitar.
Not fast enough.
This is called No Quarter.
Don't fucking talk to me. It's my bloody
act. I think I'll leave you anytime.
You couldn't even give them
a starting line.
Are you telling me you let...
It wouldn't happen in Europe!
I don't know how the guy got
in the building.
This isn't Europe or England.
I can see that. You're so inefficient!
- Somebody got it.
- Talk to me.
I'm the manager for this group.
You had people inside this building
selling posters...
...and you didn't know about it!
I didn't know about it. As soon
as we found out about it, we stopped it.
As soon as we found out about it
and told you, you stopped it!
All right, so you found out before I did.
How much kickback are you getting?
None. I knew nothing about it.
Come on! You don't know
what the concession is?
Your mate's selling the T-shirts
and making the deals.
And he told Richard about it also.
He came back, didn't he?
He does everything, doesn't he?
He does the security one night...
One night he's the guard
of the fucking dressing room.
That's fucking typical, isn't it?
As long as we screw an extra few bob
out of the group...
You really think I get something out of it?
You are the fucking controller!
That's like saying that anyone who jumps
on the stage, I'm responsible for, too.
Of course not. You're responsible
to see that the concessionaire...
You rented it. You controlled it.
Isn't selling fucking pirate posters.
You have to wait for someone else
to tell you what it's doing.
It doesn't matter so long
as there's an extra nickel to be drained.
By exploiting Led Zeppelin, it's great.
With the fucking Stars and Stripes
behind it.
We never took a dime in concession yet.
On anything.
This is called The Song Remains The Same.
Any tickets for sale?
Any tickets for sale?
How many guys out there?
Two now.
We're in good shape. Only two.
Can we get in?
- Ask these guys. They're in charge.
- Can we get in?
If it's up to me, yeah.
Thank you!
Hey, thanks a lot!
A lot of fun!
Jimmy Page, electric guitar.
Do you expect trouble?
No comment.
That's all you're going to get.
No comment is more incriminating
than a comment.
- Is it?
- Yes.
No comment.
I think this is a song of hope.
Our percussionist, John Bonham.
Moby Dick.
One hundred thirty pounds of glory,
John Bonham!
Led Zeppelin's road manager says
he put the money in the deposit box...
... and when he went back it was all gone.
The police say there was money in the box,
but they can't tell exactly how much.
The group's personal manager, Peter Grant,
discussed the theft...
... at a news conference today.
It's brought back by our attorney,
physically carried...
...because that's his function...
...and when he comes back...
...it's put into a safe-deposit box.
Police said they were questioning anyone
who had access to the safe-deposit box...
... but that's all they would say.
The money is reportedly
the largest amount ever taken...
...from a hotel safe-deposit box
in New York City.
We asked the client,
there wasn't money in the box.
Probably one of his clerks.
He noted one of the transactions.
Today was our leaving day, anyhow,
so we had that amount of money...
...because we had to pay
our airplanes and hotels.
After he met with newsmen,
police took Grant himself...
... and two of his employees
to the precinct for questioning.
New York, goodbye.
