I don't wanna see such a judgment again
I saw the opposite of justice
The circle of law is difficult than
it looks like
Judgment is just like a fusty soap opera
So-called justice
Starring: Jean Gabin
Alain Delon
Two Men In Town
Director: Jose Giovanni
My name is Germain Cazeneuve
I'm the guide officer that help
prisoners to improve themselves
Every time when I thought about that young man
who tried his best to correct his mistakes but
experienced a lot of unfortunate
I still felt heart hurt...
Nowadays the Hanging Penalty
is still existed in France
He walked to the small machine slowly
I would bethink of this when
I saw the wall of the office...
Your honor regarding the parole of prisoner Faberto...
I request your consideration
He has 6 years left...
after 20 years in jail
Matricide...will not happen again
He is a model prisoner
and will be a model even after been paroled
I will keep my eyes on him
Approved! Who is the next?
It's Gino Strabliggi
2 years left after 12 years in jail,
He is the principal of a bank robbery
Rejected!
And also the term of imprisonment is too short!
But he has never gained a general pardon
So I think that he should have a chance
He's a incorrigible guy...
cynical and self-opinioned
He also has a good side...
Officer, your mind is too simple.
Isn't it?
Law is not as same as novels
I can't approve Gino's parole
But at least he is not worse
than a matricidal man
Many rogues like him
are duplicity
I agree.
Release him is just like put a wolf in street
He learned printing with the equipments
in the prison
I guarantee when he come out from the jail...
Guarantee is easy to say but hard to achieve
I did this job for around 27 years
and I saw many many prisoners before
Though many of them
slipped back into their old ways
but it's our job to guide them
to the right way
You said you will guarantee him, right?
I will be responsible for it
Can you write down a guarantee letter?
Of course
I will give him a chance,
but you must submit the guarantee letter.
It will be in your office.
We have discussed on "Trust" last time
A philosopher said
"The trust cannot be forced"
Are you listening?
Yes
This time we are going to talk about
"Vengeance"
For example what will you do...
if somebody get wounded by a traffic accident
Run away immediately,
or someone may take me for the responsibility.
So you will leave the wounded alone?
And you just hate this guy very much.
What will you do?
What kind of hate?
A man who cajoled your wife?
Impossible!
Impossible?
Absolutely...
She brings him his favorite songs every week.
How about him?
Seems fine...just be patience
Poor timbre...
May be wear. It's the twentieth disc.
but he doesn't be bored with it
I can listen this music home next week,
that makes me very happy
Just like before,
and so does the woman.
So do both of them.
You are right.
Nothing changed
Need a taxi?
Could you stop the car?
Feel uncomfortable?
No, I just wanna walk around.
Are you OK?
Will be fine soon.
The air outside is really different,
very fresh.
What are they doing?
You won't understand it.
He's enjoying the atmosphere outside.
Thank you.
Marcel,
That's it
What?
I heard that Gino was released?
Yes
And he got a job.
It couldn't be...
How about you?
Same as before, life is but a dream
So you just on the fly?
Don't dig at me
He's freed
It's you
How are you doing?
When did you get out?
Soon after you got out there
That's great
I bought a new car
Not bad
And my partners
Is that Genevieve?
We also have some new guys
Come along with us...
You know that I respect you very much,
come on.
Gino, here is all
We four will go for the business this time
This guy is also our partner
Let's go for it, ok?
OK
What's your plan?
Plan? I haven't!
What are you talking about?
I'm just kidding.
Please, we are serious.
No I will not do that again
You will make us unhappy
I'm sorry
Are you afraid?
I've wash my hand
Wanna be a nice guy?
Maybe
Did you hear that?
This chappy wanna be a nice guy!
He must lose his backbone in the jail.
Shut up!
Sorry
Marcel, just go back please.
What?
I'm annoyed
ten pieces each week
and it becomes more and more
I make this all the days. I'm gonna crazy!
It's the end!
Be patient. I'll try to get a new work for you
I've spent all the patience in my life here
Haven't amnesty...
But your penalty is very short
There's always one day...
I will finish myself
Be calm, I will have a talk with the superintendent
Don't cheat me!
I never lie
I don't trust people like you
Everybody says that
Do you know why he felt dissatisfied?
He told me
But I also have work to do
He's a lazy beggar...
No, that's just some mental problems
If his work can be cut down...
I just followed the regulations
When despaired, he will...
You really love your job
Did I say that?
But...
What's your job?
To prevent prisoners kill themselves
is also your job.
Stop that!
You will bring trouble to your partner
You heard? He says "trouble"...
our situation is bad enough.
Drop your weapon or we will shoot you!
I will report to my higher-up.
Always "higher-up"...
they are all carefree.
You'd better talk with them at first.
Are you their cahoot?
Cahoot?
Excuse me...
You please move back and I will handle this.
You are too old to catch the tidal current.
Never mind.
We've waited you for a long time.
You are back...
Have you forgotten we have a guest tonight?
Why so late? I worried about you so much!
How about you?
Thanks for your treat.
Everyone got angry.
Nothing can help.
Had some food?
I'm not hungry.
You are on the pudding time.
I saw the newspaper.
It seems has become much serious now.
They are going to inspect the reason of it.
That's consequent.
You young blood is really wild...
I'm very soft...
But the most important thing in my mind
is to make the environment of the prison better
Did the office be damaged very much?
Keep quiet.
It's not my business even it was destroyed
I'm preparing to quit.
Really? Are you kidding?
You may retire in very close future.
Gino was rousted out of Paris and I found a job for him.
A man with criminal record
cannot stay in the capital
I brought him that as a gift.
You all right?
"Gino has been executed!"
Don't say ominous words.
And perhaps he was killed by somebody...
Don't meet your old friends any more.
Even they looks for you.
I got it.
How about your wife?
Better than any time.
It's a long time since our last meeting.
I'm planning to leave Paris.
You really quitted?
I was shifted to take care of light criminals.
But there are many people need you in Paris...
I heard that they are going to abolish the guide officer,
is that true?
Only public opinion, I don't think so.
Can I see you again afterwards?
I will go your place at weekend.
It's very quick by driving
in the expressway.
It cost a lot of my money
Nice car!
Bye! Just do some exercises tomorrow.
Pay for playing music.
She won't go there too? Really?
It's so tired and we have a lesson 8:00 AM tomorrow...
Don't make a such long phone call.
Bye. See you tomorrow.
Somebody want to correct his fault...
and somebody doesn't know his fault...
actually they are all flimsy.
It's a little different in their mind...
and fell into the hell of sin.
You got any fish?
Not yet.
It's ready for eating.
I will wait for a while.
How about me?
Jump to here,
It's ok. It's just shallow.
This is my treasure...
My wife.
I'm Gino...
You arrived there safely?
Actually...
My wife...
What happened?
Sophie loved this shop very much
But it cannot be opened any more.
She came to me...
with her family's unforgiving.
Then?
Dropped into the hell of crime.
I can imagine it.
Come to my place, I will find a job for you.
What kind of job?
How about to be my assistant?
Because I did that before?
It's Sunday, why you make so many noise?
It's the third week.
We have to work in weekdays...
Can you let us have a quiet weekend?
It's different with Paris here...
All families here are honest and friendly.
I heard about your wife's death.
But you must consider about others.
It's so noisy!
You are really misbehavior.
Sorry to bother you.
I'll call police if you don't turn it off immediately!
Don't do that now,
let we two men resolve it.
You mean you and me...
Let's "resolve" it now!
I will call the police!
She's seriously.
Don't you want to "resolve" it with me?
You can't resolve anything with violence.
You mean that?
She will call the police.
Then do it!
Turn it off!
Get out!
I turned it off.
How you did that?
Very simple, just talked with him.
Come here£¡
You didn't come here recently,
What are you doing?
And Sunday?
Just sleeping.
Go there...
OK
I will.
He changed to unclouded...
and he have had a girlfriend.
She's a clerk in a bank.
Single?
Used to has a boyfriend, maybe.
And now?
Hasn't, as I know.
Her mother is English,
and she was educated there too.
Her parents divorced when she was a little girl.
Could you tell her?
Tell her what?
My past.
It's really hard to say for me.
She will know that soon or later,
you'd better tell her earlier.
Please...
It's really hard to me.
I will give you the chance.
I must go the police station now,
it's the declaration sheet for stay.
You go there every two weeks?
Declaration Sheet for Regular Stay
A ex-criminal,
bring a certificate to local police station.
And he can't stay in
big cities or any palmy place
Certainly it's different
for a "info-provider"
Gino goes there every three months.
Now it's time for...
Excuse me, I want to declare my stay
You still remember to declare?
It was me who arrested you in Paris.
Are you Gautorro?
You may call me officer Gautorro.
Here?
Right.
Let me see you sheet...
Is it a camouflaged job?
Sorry to bothering you.
You are surely planning something?
I must leave because I have some work to do.
We are in dangerous
He is making a plan.
I believe him...
he's honest and hard-working.
He's a upright man,
and I want to tie up with him.
Do you?
You'd better consider it very clear...
I have.
The quantity is increased...
and we have bought new equipments.
To change a man
is harder than everything.
What are you meaning?
He has criminal record,
you know that?
Yes I know.
Then you still hired him?
I'd like to give you an advice.
No, I needn't.
The government officer gave me
guarantee for him.
The guide officers?
They know sweet words.
But we are different,
we are policemen.
He's not a criminal,
and he works very hard.
Don's be here again.
It's me who make decision.
Miss police.
Police?
Please.
Oh my cigarette's out.
I bought it today.
Do you like cigar?
I'll go to buy some.
My son gave me some Cuban today.
It's regret.
Well I must go out for match.
Go for it.
Lucie,
do you know anything about my job?
I know, help prisoners, right?
Right.
Very hard, hah?
And do you know the relationship
between Gino and I?
Yes.
He told you.
No, a cop told me that.
A cop?
Yes, he came to our bank.
Who?
I don't know...
He said that Gino is not a good guy.
Well,
let me know if he come again.
Feel sad?
Never mind.
Please don't give him up,
he's a good person.
He's gone?
So,
Did he say anything?
It's not my business.
It is.
It would be better
if you told me yourself...
There's no difference...
Difficult to open your mouth?
Could you be more frankly?
Could I?
But it's really nice to have secrets.
You also have secret?
What's that?
I can't say.
Maybe you are married,
or you killed somebody before.
Me?
I love you.
I miss the days I printed handbills
in time of war.
Because I may spend my life on it,
and I felt my life is substantial.
How nice it will be
if you are my son...
Gino
Marcel
Hey, how were you doing recently?
Just work.
Where?
The printing factory.
Ah, I know that.
I heard about the matter of Lucie,
I'm so sorry about that.
We just arrived here,
I will stay here for a few days,
it's difficult to staying in the
capital at present.
Come and have lunch with us.
Thanks, I got works to do.
Hey, why are you so indifferent?
Are we friends?
Someone's watching me.
Because of the bank?
Or your girlfriend?
To highjack a bank?
Correct.
I won't do that.
I've washed my hand of that.
You look so poor.
But I'm free.
Poor free...
Well, I'll tell you my address,
and you may come to find me
when you have spare time
The fifth district, Filo Street.
I suppose this is suitable for you.
You'll have two weeks to make your decision.
Have you forgotten your 10 years
in the jail?
How could I?
It's a really nice experience.
We will not fail this time,
will you come with us?
The car is not working well.
Who found it?
Why didn't he steal a better one?
Someone is tracking us.
As a rule, don't be negligent!
They ran away!
There must be something wrong.
Gino
Works?
No. You have a message from the police.
Bastard!
Perhaps it's a good news.
Impossible!
Just as I said...
Calm...
"All cops are ruffians"
You think so?
You may say that way.
You want me say, what do you want?
Be relax...
I don't want to say.
Who's that guy?
Which one?
Tell me,
or your stay permit will be cancelled.
I saw you very clear.
I tracked you yesterday.
You met each other there?
And then go the bank,
after your works in the printing factory?
When you went back.
A bank robber's girlfriend works for the bank?
You stupid!
Why you said that way?
Don't repute me as a fool.
Many people pass in and out of
the bank every day...
Does everyone pass in the bank
is for robbery?
It depends on people's mind.
I'd like to show you my pay slip.
I work very hardly.
Mmm..., you earn more than me.
Sometimes I have some extra gain.
Then...
you are itch to show your skill now.
Why do you always doubt at me?
We met by accident,
I didn't know who was she working for.
So, it's also a coincidence that
you encountered your ex-cahoot?
I will not see them any more.
Every one of them?
Yes, I've decided to forget all my past.
OK, so just sign here.
For what?
For yourself.
You can't coerce me!
Then we can detain you for 24 hours.
Take out everything with you.
You are going to a fault!
Really?
Hi, where is Gino.
He hasn't come back?
Yes, I'm worried about him.
Thank, I got leave.
The father drinks very much,
and the mother always not home,
so I have no choice but leave the family.
You want to find a job in Leayo county?
Yes.
Please connect to the Bureau of Justice
of Leayo county.
Gino...
What happened?
was under arrest.
Why?
I don't know.
I did nothing wrong.
The police...
They don't believe everything I told them.
They just treat me unjustly.
I met the officer,
He just wants to prevent you
to making any mistakes.
Gautorro?
Are you afraid?
Whatever they want.
Anyhow they just want you to sign
a declaration to guarantee you will not see
any of your ex-cahoots.
Only a sign? Is that true?
Always sign, sign, sign...
Just keep away from those people.
But we may fall across each other sometimes.
You only need to explain it then.
Why didn't I die in that traffic accident?
Sign here, then you may go out.
You'd better do what he said.
I see.
Could I believe it...
Keep your surveillance of No.5 Filo street.
A day...
Give me the pictures and files,
don't be mindless.
We met each other at the parking place,
and I took his address.
Why didn't you told the police that?
But that's my friend!
Why don't you disengage them?
Does 10 years' jail life mean nothing to you?
But...
Just keep away from them.
I didn't walk close to them.
You must do what you said.
I didn't do anything wrong.
Don't be enticed by them.
Thanks.
Are you tired?
I'm fine.
What about have a journey to Lucie's hometown?
My hometown is here.
How could this happen?
This country makes me lose my breath.
What's your mean of "this country"?
Is justice existed here?
Does sacrificing mean anything for justice?
They are all populace.
democracy was totally collapsed here.
It looks away from the point.
We are talking about you.
But you said too much.
Don't quarrel for me.
What do you think about Lucie?
Nice...
What's her merit?
Be happy, just forget it.
You're right.
Do you like kids?
Kids?
Yup, lovely kids?
Small...
And then grow up slowly...
to be another you.
We will teach him,
and make him a good boy.
That's must be very happy life.
I love you.
Don't be too self-willed.
No, it's belief.
To inhibit them too much will
push them to make mistakes probably.
He had reformed himself.
It's not so easy to reform somebody.
He also has his good side.
I saw this side of him.
He works very hard every day.
Sincere than common people.
I'm entitled to have a suspicion of anybody.
I used to be a cop.
Why you quitted then?
Because the criminal rate increased
obviously after the war.
So I decided to shift my job after
thinking very carefully.
To be a guide officer?
That's right.
To report what you did is also part of my job.
Just write what you want to.
I need to talk with you.
What?
Let's talk inside.
I have a meeting with Gautorro a minute ago.
And?
Did you see Marcil again?
What?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Yes.
I'm asking you if you saw him recently?
Even you doubt at me?
No, I just want to confirm that.
I can't make you trust me?
All right...
That's it...
I'm just part of your experiment.
You want to throw me back into the jail, right?
But I will not satisfy you!
I will not satisfy all of you!
I won't forgive you...
...if you come to asking me any
strange questions next time.
It's not true...
Yup!
Miss...
Why you here again?
I am worried about you.
You influenced me to doing my job.
We will be closed soon.
Bastard!
What's that man doing there?
Does he lose his mind?
Hey, stop!
What are you doing?
Sorry.
Are you crazy?
Maybe...
Do you have too much time?
You are really bored!
Too bored!
Are you intimidating me?
Do you think so?
Let's go, we'll be late!
Officer!
They came back with a big bag.
How many people there?
I'll be right there.
Burning all the stocks the bonds.
Why?
We can't sell them to anybody.
Did we decide to snatch everything?
If you didn't know it, don't say you know.
We missed the Helvetic franc.
It's much valuable than US dollars.
Call Ambulance! We can't let him die.
Don't let the media know about it.
Remember?
Is this your address?
You should remember this.
You were sold by Gino.
I'm very pity for you.
We'll catch him for you.
Gino is a real snake.
He sold you for the staying permit.
The visiting time is out!
I need a little more time.
His wound is very bad.
I have my duty.
We are not in police station.
The hospital is really care about the patients.
So do you.
You are the chief officer.
How is your searching going?
Gino will be captured soon.
I believe he is not the principal.
You think...
That's right.
You have any personal enmity with him?
Of course not.
But he is really a bad guy.
If we send his girlfriend to see Marcel...
What did you know?
His real features are coming out.
And his boss is...
It's also him who planned the bank robbery.
Any evidence?
Don't only judge it depend on
your experience of 10 years ago.
Sir...
I never join my emotion to my works.
I know.
Be careful.
Don't be mindless.
We are going to arrest him today.
It's some problem with the battery.
I may fix it before the nightfall.
You can drive my car.
No thanks. I'll drive my wife's car.
I got leave right now.
It's so hot.
I'll tell my husband.
Husband? You are married?
Do your parents know that?
Not yet.
You decided it by yourself?
Go the hospital with me.
Why?
Is Gino...?
No, it's another one.
No!
I'm trying to help you.
Your husband is a bank robber.
If I tell your manager about this...
then probably you'll be fired...
I always listen to beauties like you.
Gautorro!
I'll kill you!
Stop! Gino!
Stop it!
Let our daughter make breakfast today.
I'll be late, I must go now.
It smells burnted!
Sorry it's a little burnted.
It doesn't matter.
Dad, Gino killed someone!
What did you say?
The body of officer Gautorro was found
at the site scene of the event.
The suspect, Gino, was under arrest.
Excuse me...
Mr.La Corn
Had you ever seen this man?
Yes.
Do you remember the situation at that time?
He demolished the scrapped vehicles with a hammer.
Absolutely...
I can remember it.
Even it's only a bagatelle.
But he demolished vehicles in others' place.
What's your attention?
To abreact your compliant to police?
It's an advantaged proof for defence.
What advantage will be...
to destroy others' property that way?
Write it down at first, anyway.
Mr.Boder,
Have you seen this man?
I used to live in the same mansion with him.
He often influenced others' life.
Don't be afraid, just tell us all you know.
And I was beated by him once.
It was a Sunday.
Do you have anything to tell us?
Where's the proof?
I never lie.
It's enough to him only for
murdered a policeman.
We must make everything clear.
You mean everything?
So if I stepped on someone's foot on a bus...
You please also make an investigation.
The girl's confession is very disadvantageous
for Gino.
And the psychiatrist's identification
is also disadvantageous for him.
"He's born to has a criminal tendency".
If he's born to,
he shouldn't be punished for that then.
He should take another identification.
But no more identifications.
Anyway I still believe in
the judgment will be fair.
At least...
he may ask the judge for commute.
Court! Defendant comes up!
Take your seat please.
He's an honest man.
He makes his greatest efforts
to do everything.
He's not a guy who often makes mistakes.
Did you even hire...
...such a hard-working man as him?
I did.
But did that man also murder a cop?
No more questions.
The eyewitness is the defendant's wife.
So whatever she said...
...couldn't be a powerful evidence.
Then it's me.
Don't dozing, please.
Quiet!
A Juror will be compunctious...
if he dozing during an adjudgment.
The defendant is a unlucky guy.
He spent 10 years in jail for
the mistakes he made before.
I didn't bring out what I should say.
I just presented very partially.
It's misery for him that
he couldn't get other's forgiven to his past.
You aren't a lawyer, are you?
No, I'm not.
And it isn't the time to comment on law.
About the law, I need to say something.
The law should contain justice and allowance.
We must know the suspect's motivation
very clear before we make the judgment.
Witness, did you forget the defendant
was a prisoner?
Everybody would want to kill somebody
at least once in his life...
...when he's really angry about something.
Such like be stepped on his foot by somebody?
Your comparison doesn't make sense here.
It's also his misery to encountered
a suspect who was hounded by police.
Do you mean it's the victim himself
who made this incident happened?
I just want to say it's caused
by coincidence.
Hope you will consider it very carefully.
That's all I want to say.
Your honor, the jurors...
Generally I don't know your thought...
...about inquisitor's accusation.
But it's the different situation today.
I'm sure that...
my accusation against the defendant here
will be supported by the entire country.
He's really a butter-tonsiled guy.
The victim is a very good man.
He's a good father, and a good husband
The Gautorro's family who wear in mourning
dress is sitting in the public gallery.
They won everybody's compassion.
Officer Gautorro is a great
and exemplary police officer.
And Gino Strabliggi is a crazy killer!
It's very clear...
...the jurors...
You can't give him any commute.
He must be executed!
I cannot inhibit my grief and indignation.
Only death penalty is suitable
for his sin.
The lawyer looks a litter nervous...
Your honor, the jurors...
Everybody knows the defendant
was in prison for 10 years.
But, besides insults and pig's food,
there were only warden's contempt,
and scolding during the 10 years.
It was 10 years without
personality and self-respect.
There's something really unforgettable
in her ending presentation.
Recently, the bad conditions in jails...
was dig out by the media.
The suicide of prisoners increased
every year.
Every prisoner hates the corrupt management.
Rebellions happened very often.
However, the inquisitor should
consider it on the other side.
He completely didn't consider about
officer Gautorro should be responsible...
...for his too much searching without measure.
And he strongly asked for death penalty...
...it's really irresponsible!
We french should be shame about one thing,
...the most ruthless penalty, hanging!
How can we say we are living in
a civilized country?
Quiet! Quiet!
The well-known philosopher Parcel Calo
ever said...
The chief justice is doodling...
some of the jurors are dozing.
What is justice?
The inquisitor talked about the hanging today...
...in this court...
...and strongly asked to punish
the defendant with it.
He even asked to chop off
the defendant's head!
The Jurors,
don't become the complicity of a murder.
The defendant,
do you have anything to say?
No.
Gino Strabliggi was condemned to hanging.
This event brought the French a big impact.
You must keep trying!
Go back home.
The appeal was rejected three months later.
The only thing we can do is to
request the amnesty from the president.
You won't go to see the president?
It's very difficult.
Is there anything I can do for him?
No, all we can do now it to preying for him.
She likes him.
She's so young, and she will forget it soon.
Darling,
the girl is so poor.
It's fate, we can't do anything help.
