LITTLE WHITE LIES 2
What the hell, you guys?
Hi there.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hey, Max.
We wanted to surprise you
for your birthday.
How come?
Sabine said you had no plans.
After so long, so much crap...
We all miss you so much.
- So we thought the time is now.
- Yeah, Max.
Your 60th.
We can't leave you on your own.
Happy birthday.
Happy birthday, dad.
Thanks, baby. It's in three days.
- Hi, dad.
- Hi there.
I missed you, buddy. I missed you.
You good?
This is my boyfriend, Alex.
Hello. Happy birthday.
Maxou! My Maxou!
Hi.
Can I have a word?
There you go.
I don't get it.
I say I'm feeling down.
I need to be alone.
I'm going away,
I won't celebrate my birthday.
So you invite
a longlost bunch of friends to party.
I didn't invite them. Vincent did.
I don't know them,
or how they got my number.
Fucking insane!
After the last time,
they plan a vacation here.
To surprise you!
I messed up. I should've said no.
But oftentimes you tell me
you'd be sad
never to see them again.
I thought you'd be pleased. I'm sorry.
That's not the problem.
I don't have the house.
I'm not staying.
Vero arrives in 2 days.
What do I do?
It's war.
If I tell her not to come...
You never told me.
Where did you plan to go all week?
I don't know, I had no plan.
I need to be alone. I'm suffocating!
Can't you understand?
Alright...
So how long are they staying?
The week.
I'll tell them to go home.
Sabine...
Don't start that with me.
I'm begging you.
If you love me,
honestly, don't start that with me.
What do you really want?
You ask why you're lonely.
When they come to see you, you sulk.
- Fuck!
- What?
Nothing.
Shit!
Alright...
Don't say a word.
We'll find a solution.
When I'm down, I'm a jerk. I know.
We'll talk about it later but...
Not a word to them.
- Morning!
- Hello, Jean-Michel.
Jean-François!
Sorry. Jean-François.
I have a major issue, actually.
Some friends have rocked up,
and they don't know.
Should I come back later?
No, I don't know.
They weren't supposed to be here.
Know what we'll do?
Shit!
Fuck, you saw me.
You saw me!
I'm such an idiot!
Happy birthday!
It's in 3 days.
Hi.
Jean-Christophe. A friend.
I'm so happy to see you.
Same here.
I fucked up the surprise!
I mean, I thought I was late.
They're all here.
- They are?
- Yes.
Fuck, I am late then!
I just got the text
about meeting at the end of the lane.
The train was a pain in the ass!
Spot me 100 for the taxi?
I'll pay you back.
I was in a rush
and I couldn't find an ATM.
The one in town hasn't moved.
Here.
- Alright, leave the talking to me.
- Sure.
Thanks!
Fuck!
Nino, we're here.
Come on!
Goodbye.
Fuck it!
Driveway cabin, main house,
backyard cabin.
Sleeps 8 in all.
Great. The cabins are on the mains?
Yes. Quiet!
This is Jean-Michel, a local friend.
Hi.
- Vincent.
- Nice to meet you.
Antoine.
Sabine, my partner.
Isabelle. Jean-Michel.
Max, you want me to go?
If I'm the problem, I'll go.
Hello!
About time!
Hey, babe!
How are you?
Good to see you.
Hey!
Why the long face?
I ain't got another.
On time too, great.
Don't give me shit.
Train was late, don't blame me.
And no phone to call?
I dozed off in the cab, ok?
I need a note from mommy?
Or can I say hello?
I'm Sabine. Welcome.
Thanks.
Nino, say hello.
- How old is he?
- He's 7.
I said it first.
Hey, you! Remember the house?
And the old guy here?
The house a bit
but the old guy, no.
Sorry.
- Too young.
- I guess.
- Want a drink?
- You bet!
A cold beer. Or white wine maybe.
Jean-Michel?
I'm good, thanks.
- Show you around, buddy?
- Sure, great.
And?
And maybe we're going.
No kidding?
After that welcome, I'll bounce.
It's kinda tense.
Kinda?
Come on, we knew it might get tense.
You didn't expect garlands of flowers
and cocktails, did you?
- Living room-slash-dining room.
- Yes, excellent.
So...
Next up...
The guest bedrooms.
Yes, excellent.
The house has so many memories for them.
If they find out...
Alright, the last guest room.
The bathroom's on the small side.
May I now?
There we are.
Bathroom.
I didn't expect so many bedrooms.
A fine property. It should sell fast.
Sweetheart, sorry but...
Everybody's outside,
unsure what to do.
Can't you go talk to them?
- I'll be going.
- I'll see you out.
- Sorry, I'm not running you out.
- No, I must go.
- Bye then.
- Bye, Jean-Michel.
- See you soon.
- Yes, see you soon.
- What do we do?
- About?
Tomorrow's viewings.
I don't know.
I'll try to find a solution
rather than delay it. I'll see.
Mr. Cantara, no rush.
We can line up visits for next week.
Come off it!
My ex-wife will be here.
Sorry, I forgot.
- No gaffes. She has no idea.
- Sure.
We sit tight till she leaves.
So, thank you, and have a good day.
Dad, where's the cabin key?
- For the scooter.
- It's crammed.
Give us a ride then?
On that beam.
Sorry, I'm going to be blunt.
You guys can't stay.
So, thanks for trying
to organize a surprise.
Sweet of you to worry about me
all of a sudden.
But Vero arrives in two days,
so I of course...
I was supposed to split. So...
Sorry to ruin this fabulous reunion.
I have no choice but to ask you to go.
At least you can't be mad at me
for asking you to go,
seeing as I didn't invite you.
You know...
For years,
my sole pleasure
was that you felt at home here.
Asking you to go makes me feel sick.
I have no choice.
So, really sorry, Eric,
it's cool of you to invite...
No, it's cool,
putting out invitations,
but you put me in a shitty position.
I come off
as the asshole party-pooper.
I didn't organize this.
I didn't want to come.
They all called to persuade me.
But you came.
After all you said the last time.
After all you threw in my face, remember?
"Croak and shove your money
up your ass!"
Fuck! Now you rock up
like you own the place.
No, not like I own the place, dammit.
Come on, you know me!
Do I look chilled here?
Can't you see I'm not?
All this is my fault, sorry.
We shouldn't have just dropped in on you.
Please, buddy,
don't take it the wrong way.
We just wanted to surprise you
for your birthday.
I'm not celebrating my fucking birthday!
Get it into your heads!
How do I have to say it?
Cut out the buddy bullshit!
I'm your buddy now?
Our lives have gone separate ways.
And quit saying you miss me.
Maybe you miss this.
Not me. You dropped me
like a piece of shit.
That's unfair. We didn't.
The clash was with Eric.
You lumped us all together,
didn't even answer my messages.
You all abandoned me!
For 3 years, you vacationed in Corsica.
At his place.
Making sure you invited Vero.
Okay then,
stop.
This is all a sham.
You can't stand me anyway.
Buddies for 20 years
doesn't mean buddies forever.
Max, don't say that. We stopped coming
when it stopped being a vacation.
We told you, you ignored us.
Like our being here pissed you off.
So, no change there.
One hell of a great birthday present,
coming here...
to trash me.
That's not what we're doing.
We're talking it through.
It's important
so we can make up, come on.
You couldn't get over Ludo's death.
Nor could we.
It was tough for us, too.
It was like you blamed us.
On top of that,
you and Vero separating...
That was hellish.
Sorry for using our only two weeks a year
to rest up elsewhere.
So you speak up,
'cause you can afford somewhere else.
We speak up
'cause we wasted enough time.
We're here
'cause we want you in our lives.
And we missed you.
A lot, in fact.
I never should have said it.
I regretted it
the moment I said it but...
It took me time to admit it.
So I came to apologize.
I apologize.
I also came to introduce you
to my daughter.
My 10-month-old girl,
waiting in the car.
If you're kicking us out, I'll go.
Wait.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
It cuts me up,
seeing you all again.
I was so mad at you all.
But I'm glad to see you here now.
We'll find a solution.
Two days is better than nothing.
I need a nap.
I don't get much sleep now.
Know what? Give me an hour
and I'm on it.
I can't wait to meet your daughter.
All good?
They've gone?
The others have all gone?
Yeah.
Gone to buy dinner.
I'll grab a shower.
I'll join you.
What?
Just joking. To make you laugh.
We're gonna have fun.
- Catherine, can't you do something?
- She's hungry.
Besides feeding her at mealtimes,
what is there to do?
Leaving?
Shortly.
Look who I found!
How are you, Nassim?
My friend!
You feel it?
You feel that beautiful energy?
I so feel it.
Yes, that energy.
You hipsters done hugging?
I got shit to do.
What the heck is your problem?
And you?
He's famous
so we put a lid on it?
How is famous relevant, dummy?
Shithead!
Nobody taught you manners?
Get out!
Get out, asswipe! I'll fuck you up!
Shut it or I'll get out.
Come on, I'll take you both down.
Marie, stop!
- Stop.
- Let go!
Get out, you dickwads!
Beat it! Get out of here.
- Get the hell off me.
- Knock it off.
Send the bitch to an asylum!
Shit!
Fuckwit!
The guy calls me shithead, bitch,
and I gotta suck it up?
- You're getting old!
- Sure.
You're a crappy coward!
Look, Marie, this is one.
It's so cool. You made it?
For his birthday.
I made four.
I forgot how many toilets there are.
Dope!
- What is it?
- A little bench.
Put it on the floor, feet on it.
The aim is to raise your knees.
Same principle as a squat toilet.
Doing it sitting down is recent,
like 200 years.
Since the dawn of time,
humans squatted to do it.
- Squat and...
- My body will thank me.
Are we really discussing this,
how to poop?
He's right.
No more compressed stomach,
straight back.
Defecation is much freer. Super logical!
Don't you start, too.
Dude, like forever, I squat to shit.
Squat how?
Feet on the seat.
No way!
You're kidding me. Seriously?
I don't want to see what I'm seeing.
There, gone!
You squat to shit!
No way!
You're kidding me! You don't?
What's with him?
I don't know.
Out you get.
Just a minute.
- What's gotten into you?
- Hurry up!
Hi Antoine,
beautiful to see you again.
Yes.
Ready?
- Good to go?
- Where?
Antoine!
What are you doing?
Running.
You said we'd run
after the grocery run.
We're too old to run for a room.
And the mood he's in, best not.
Help me.
You're nuts.
The guy's nuts.
Here.
Catherine?
Catherine, can you help...
I have to go because...
I'll call you back. Lots of love.
Sorry.
- Hold on, mommy.
- Can you help?
I warned you all morning.
It's late for your daughter's lunch,
late for me!
Remember, I worked all night.
Today, I'm supposed to be off.
So I want my bedroom right now.
I have a right to rest.
I know. You're absolutely right.
But it's better if we move in,
then go to your hotel.
It's better if we stick to the plan.
If you're not happy, ask the agency
for someone who can work your hours!
- Yes, mommy.
- We'll drive you there now.
Don't. You'll throw your back out.
Thanks. Leave it there, I've got it.
Take Catherine to her hotel, will you?
It's a problem?
No, it's fine.
Yes, booboo.
Daddy's coming.
Thanks, Nassim.
The pleasure is all mine, Max.
I made them with you in mind.
That one's special.
It was my grandfather's.
He made it himself.
Happy birthday, my friend.
Thanks, Nassim.
I need to finish clearing up now.
Yes, of course. I'll leave you to it.
Such joy to see you after so long.
I couldn't deliver them,
couldn't reach you.
Life took over, with a beautiful encounter
with Marie at the market.
Alright.
See you.
Goodbye, Max.
Goodbye, Nassim.
So long, Eric!
Workout, anytime you want!
I want! Thanks a lot.
As if I don't have enough clutter.
Call junk removals.
Don't cry, possum.
Aren't you beautiful!
You're so beautiful!
I'm delighted to meet you, sugar.
Looks like you.
Thanks, but no.
Maybe a bit like her mother.
Come on.
Come on, possum.
Where is she?
Dropping MDMA in Ibiza.
Can we change the subject?
I think I have fantastic news for you.
Really? What?
Want one?
I quit ten years ago.
No more problem with Vero.
I have the solution.
I just rented a superb place.
Huge, magnificent.
Oceanfront.
We can reconnect, have fun.
There you are.
We all pitch in, clean up here,
and we split. It's 10 minutes away.
You get some rest.
Leave it all to me.
Kick back, do nothing.
Tomorrow morning, we're gone.
Problem solved.
Thank you, who? Thank you, Eric!
No, look...
I really appreciate it but...
I have urgent stuff in Paris.
I need to go.
- You guys go without me.
- Hold on, what the...
What are you talking about?
We want to be with you.
You're like my big brother.
A big brother to all of us.
What's wrong?
Max, buddy, what's wrong?
Look at me.
What's wrong, buddy? Tell me.
The banks cut me loose.
I have nothing. I gotta sell.
Holy shit!
You're in good health.
That's the main thing.
Obviously I won't say a word
but it's dumb going to Paris alone.
Stay with us, reset.
Splitting shows there's an issue.
To your chick especially.
You told Sabine?
I couldn't face it yet.
We'll do like we said.
Max, it'll do you good.
Ok, but do me one favor.
Anything.
Please!
My friends! Isa!
Vincent! I have something to say!
Antoine!
Come on, listen up!
Well...
Not being the type
to kick my buddies out,
I have the solution.
Problem solved. You're staying.
- Awesome!
- But not here.
I have rented a superb place,
where we can spend our vacation.
- You didn't!
- Adorable, Max. Thanks!
I suggest...
We cook up a storm.
Tomorrow morning, we blow.
The vacation is on!
- Awesome, Max!
- Thank you!
To celebrate,
I'll crack out the good stuff!
Really? No kidding!
- Awesome!
- How many bedrooms?
Lots!
That's great news.
Here, Max.
For the taxi this morning.
There's no need.
Why not? It's only normal.
That's new.
How'd it work before?
- Before that.
- Kids died.
Delicious Bordeaux.
Any cheese to go with it?
- Sure, I'll get it.
- No.
I'll go.
Day one.
We said we'd start tomorrow.
- I swear we'll run tomorrow.
- No problem, kitten.
You're a big boy. I'll even go get it.
Thank you.
So you guys are at kitten already?
Cool, isn't he?
- He's great.
- Awesome. Insanely talented.
Does he ever need extras on stage?
What does he do?
Choreographer.
Former principal dancer in Paris.
In the reign of Louis XIV?
He's the same age as Max.
Sure, Max knew Robespierre.
I heard all that.
We were kidding.
How did you meet?
About a year ago, in a consultation.
He came in about his ankle.
I fixed him up.
Funny, same here, in a consultation.
You're a shrink?
No, he had raging toothache.
From grinding them, I guess.
With the anesthetic, he started crying
and I just fell for him.
So cute.
I soon saw what I'd gotten into.
He's a little kitten.
We're really delighted...
That I had toothache?
That you guys met.
Mom, my tooth fell out.
That's great!
Let me see.
Which one?
- Amazing!
- The big one!
Under your pillow, for the tooth fairy.
I don't know. Ask mommy.
What's he want?
An ice cream.
No sugar before bed.
Definitely not shit sugar.
Bedtime!
- The film's not finished.
- If you stayed put, you could watch it.
Go to bed.
Don't worry, Elliot's going, too.
Elliot!
Bedtime, with Nino!
Seriously? It's not our bedtime.
We're different ages.
Come on!
Everybody in bed!
Jeanne! Arthur!
Set an example. Lights out.
To your rooms now.
Let's go!
Great vacation.
Why us, too?
It's a crap age.
Remember Sunday nights?
The film begins.
"Bedtime, school tomorrow."
And acne!
Don't I get a kiss?
He's grown so fast. It's insane.
Love you.
Love you, too.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Just looking at you.
You really have grown.
Brings back memories.
Not that my birthday's March 15.
Whoa, Elliot, what was that?
Sorry, Max.
No worries.
I'm used to it with those two dopes.
He deserves a better godfather.
No way, you've got that one?
Just look at us!
Let me see.
Look, it's Eric,
pre-Mr. Potato Head
Very funny.
You're laughing?
Come on.
How we've changed!
When was it? 7 years ago?
No, nearly 8.
Mommy's beautiful!
Who's he?
That's Ludo.
Who's Ludo?
Nino, bedtime! Let's go, bed!
I loved the last one. That comedy.
I loved making that movie.
I was glad it did well.
My last couple posted big numbers.
I'm in a good place.
Antoine, did I leave my phone
on the table?
Sit tight, I'm on it.
So you never get off your ass?
You need an assistant
to get your phone?
It's true, it's a bit weird.
Is anyone else finding him work?
It's a job, isn't it?
Dial it down, guys.
You pay him in food stamps?
No way. I'm in the actors' union.
Slackers' union, you mean.
Very funny, smartypants.
I don't see the problem.
Eric's my best buddy and boss.
I know where the line is.
He was there for me
and I won't forget it.
My parents likewise. They love him.
It can't be easy for you, Eric.
I mean, with the actor,
assistant, friend and confidant,
you're never sure who you're getting.
You never make it awkward.
So, thank you, Eric.
What's that annoying beep?
Sorry, it's my notifications.
It's Happn, a dating app.
Apparently, I'm a hit in the area.
Can I put some music on?
Yes!
I'll show you.
Connect via Bluetooth.
Alex doesn't get Bluetooth.
Let me do it.
He didn't have to do all that.
- There it is.
- Which one do you want?
- That one.
- That one? Awesome.
I love it.
What are you doing?
I'm going to bed.
It's a wooden house.
Can't leave the fire.
But we're all here.
Shit!
Sorry. It's just that I thought...
- You want me to relight it?
- 'Course not.
What are you doing?
One last drink?
Sorry, my friends,
I didn't get much sleep.
Last night was...
So...
A good night's sleep
to be in shape tomorrow.
But you guys have fun. It's cool.
Goodnight, Max.
See you, Max.
Goodnight!
I hope Alex isn't an issue.
I wanted you to meet.
I'm so in love
but nothing like with you.
We were off the scale!
Night, toots! Vincent.
Ok, Vincent?
Yeah.
- Come on.
- Over here.
Is that herbal smell you guys?
You'll make yourself sick.
Not a word.
Isabelle, you're looking sublime.
Watching you dance earlier,
you've really come on recently.
You seem confident.
Honestly.
Happy in your skin, serene.
It can't have been...
easy every day.
Your body is just magnificent.
And if you don't mind me saying,
what's going on with that ass?
What happened?
Are you hitting on me?
Yes, maybe I am.
With regard to Vincent, is it awkward?
Antoine, you know,
all these years not...
I had no idea anymore
what an orgasm was.
Recently, I feel alive again,
doing some crazy stuff.
I can't seem to stop...
The more fun I have,
the more I want.
Sure.
However, I laid down one rule,
and that's not doing anything stupid.
There has to be some...
seduction.
You see?
I need to feel attracted in some way.
- Attracted, yeah.
- You see?
With you, it's weird,
like banging my little bro.
Yeah.
Yeah, alright. No, yeah.
Yeah, no, I see what you mean.
From that angle...
Thanks for what you said. I'm...
Don't thank me.
You just seem in great shape.
Goodnight.
See you tomorrow.
See you, sleep well.
- I hope it's good.
- Yeah.
You have all you need? Sure?
Sleep well, see you tomorrow.
What's up, champ? You're not in bed?
I can't sleep with all the others.
I'm scared.
Can I sleep with you?
No.
I've had it
with sleeping with you kids.
- Doing every generation.
- What?
Nothing.
Alright.
Come on, tonight only.
Let's go, beddy-byes.
- It's under the pillow.
- Yeah.
There you go.
Goodnight, champ.
Come on.
- What?
- Come here a minute.
I'm not laying down, no.
Just for a second.
See, isn't this great together?
Sure.
Hold still.
Guys, where you going?
The luggage won't do itself.
I told you, no Facetime.
My screen's bust. Nino can't see you.
I can see him, what's the problem?
Nino!
Your father.
Hey, buddy!
Ciao, bambino!
- You ok?
- Yeah, we just arrived.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, but I can't see you.
Shit!
I can hear you, not see you.
That's dumb.
It's shit.
You got my text?
Yeah.
There's...
a cabin.
With bedrooms.
You'll see.
To your right, pool.
To your right, the pool!
- There's a pool!
- Heated?
Yeah.
There, more bedrooms.
And here...
- Maybe dump the luggage here?
- Yes, exactly.
This is the main house.
I'll open up here.
Holy shit!
You nailed it. Nailed it!
I want to chip in, Max. It's too much.
It's insane.
Crazy! Max, are you out of your mind?
Sublime, right?
Yup.
Right, Alex? Isn't it beautiful?
Must cost a fortune, all this.
How much? What did you pay?
Don't worry.
Well then?
It's nuts!
- How about that view?
- Off the charts.
- Superb.
- Unbelievable. Magnificent.
Sublime!
Tell you what, oceanfront
is something else.
Wild. How come we never saw
a house like this?
Now it seems absurd,
a place without a sea view.
Changes everything.
Love you.
Love you too.
Max, what's the deal with the rooms?
Max is here to rest.
I deal with all that.
You ok?
Thanks.
Sleeping arrangements...
See for yourself.
I already saw the room.
You did? Even worse. Thanks.
Very nice.
Look. You're shitting me?
I can't sleep here!
I'm always in kiddies' rooms.
The house is huge.
And there's a lot of us.
Calm down and make an effort.
Why not here?
That room's for Isa. Knock it off now.
- Give Isa an upstairs room.
- No! I want Fatso in there.
Not a hotel.
I'm Fatso?
No.
No, I meant, fatsos in general, not...
Thanks for nothing.
Catherine!
Cathy!
So that's one free room.
- You can't walk out on me.
- Call a cab. I'm going home.
I didn't mean it, it was a dumb joke.
I'd never think that.
As a kid, I was fat.
Growing up, I was the butt of the joke.
I know exactly how you feel.
Or not.
I mean...
No, that came out wrong.
Her mother's crazy,
incapable of looking after her.
It stresses me out enormously.
I know how crucial you are
to my child's wellbeing.
Hey, baby?
Maybe I don't express things,
but I genuinely admire you.
And I appreciate all you do for her.
When you scold me...
Cut it out, it's unbearable.
Get a grip!
Sorry.
C'mon, baby, daddy's here for you.
That's a shameful act.
You're not even good.
You're irresponsible.
Yes. That's why I need you, see?
I'll stay. But only for Mila.
After the vacation, find someone else.
I understand.
- No, you don't.
- Not at all.
You're pathetic.
Here.
There we are.
Suitcase!
Marie!
Alright, back into my hole.
Catherine, we're sorry.
It's our first day.
We're all excited.
See you in the room in a moment.
Down! Down!
Turn it down!
We caught a crab!
It's enormous!
- Look at that.
- Sick!
It needs a name.
- Crabus.
- Crabus?
Crabus the kiddie-nipper!
How about I whip up some pasta?
Something simple.
That's awesome!
Yes, pasta's great.
Do you want a hand?
Max, you do nothing.
- Ok?
- I feel amazing.
Evening, folks!
Jean-Louis!
With oysters? Very original.
My specialty is to keep you guessing.
Alright?
- Hey, princess?
- Hey, you.
- How are you?
- Just great.
Hey, buddy.
You're cooking?
I know. Pasta with oysters!
That's gross.
What's that called? Vongole?
No, those are clams. So clam up.
What's the difference
between an oyster and a clam?
You can't lick an oyster open.
Hi, Antoine.
- How are you?
- Great.
I forgot to ask you,
did you come with Juliette?
Jean-Louis, come over here.
How are things?
Really good. You look in great shape.
Don't you have anything better to do?
Guys, you freak me out.
At your age, life was a blast.
Drawing, poetry, bike-riding.
Treehouses.
There you are, zombies watching screens.
You don't do any sports.
Life is nothing without A!
Know what A is? Adrenaline.
Not your stupid
mindlessness.
What are you two doing?
What's that?
Pine processionaries. Don't touch.
Really? Scoot.
Careful, they're pine processionaries.
Yeah, great, go on.
- What are you doing?
- Moving them over.
I wouldn't do that.
Jean-Louis and Nassim
say they're super irritant.
They can say what they want.
Move out the way!
- What a jerk!
- Go!
Bullshit! What does Nassim know about it?
Breathe through your nose.
You may croak.
Jean-Pierre, the local quack.
- It's for me.
- Evening!
Evening, doctor.
A beautiful angioedema!
Magnificent!
- Hands off the caterpillars.
- I know.
No one told him?
We told him!
Ok, Antoine? Get some sleep.
No, I'm good here with you guys.
Where are you going?
To watch the movie with the others.
Goodnight, sunshine.
Marie, how's things in Rennes?
Fine, they are what they are.
It's not easy moving back home,
but it's practical, with Nino,
and my job, working nights.
A restaurant, right?
Bar and concert hall.
And your travels,
the Indian tribes and stuff?
The tribes all have cellphones.
What the hell use am I there?
It's a shittyass world.
We all catch the crab.
One person in three gets cancer.
Let's do the math.
10 of us around this table,
that means 3 and a bit of us.
Forget the long faces.
Eating shit for years,
shoulda thought about it earlier.
Anyway, I'm one of those who think
it's pointless fighting back.
We get the picture, for sure.
- "For sure"?
- Yeah, loud and clear.
Piss me off!
Gonna get me a beer.
Well, I have good news.
I've checked that box.
That counts one person out
at the table.
Sorry, Marie, nothing personal but...
It's important to keep fighting.
I had breast cancer two years ago.
Now, life's great.
And so...
I know, buzz-killer.
No, not at all.
So you're cured or in remission?
In remission.
Alright. So not completely cured.
That counts half a person out.
Statistically.
It's one way of counting.
In terms of Marie's math.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I'm a shithead. I apologize.
No, really.
It's all good, Marie. All good.
Sure, it could have its uses.
I don't get what it involves exactly.
They're ice packs
placed around the perineum.
No, you're kidding.
Not a bit.
No, it's deadly serious.
Everybody's asleep
but I saw your light.
Can I borrow your car?
Yeah.
For sure.
Ok?
- Here.
- Thanks.
Hey, how are you?
Good, and you?
Great. Not much sleep, but great.
I went to Pau.
Pau?
- That's miles away.
- I really liked his pic.
Want some coffee?
Now hands behind your head.
And 25 crunches,
in time with your breathing.
Open up shark fins now.
- Perfect. Why clench that butt?
- To strengthen the core.
Core, core, core.
Your body's a garden,
you're its gardener.
Girls, what do you want for dinner?
Thanks, buddy.
- Ok, ask my ass.
- What?
Morning.
- You ok?
- Hey.
- Water maybe?
- In the kitchen.
Thanks.
What's the deal?
Totally nuts.
- Enough.
- No, not enough.
Where'd you meet her?
Morning. Water maybe?
- In the kitchen.
- Thanks.
Thanks.
- See you, Arthur.
- See you around, girls.
Son, you've made your old man proud.
There are no words.
No. Nothing happened.
- They said no?
- Anything but.
So?
They're sisters. It's gross.
Shit!
No way!
- Idiot child.
- Seriously, no way!
You're right, Arthur. Don't listen.
You're not right. Look at me.
You'll regret it every day of your life.
Every single day.
You'll grow old regretting it!
You're nuts!
They're your sisters?
Precisely! He's nuts.
- That's so creepy.
- Creepy? It's nature!
FOR SALE
What a jerk, dammit!
A complete jerk. I don't believe it
I told him to wait, dammit!
Call real estate broker.
Damn!
Max Cantara calling. The sign!
The sign on the gate, dammit!
I told you to wait!
What the hell!
Paris plates. Surprise me.
Max Cantara?
Goddammit!
I don't believe it.
- How are you?
- Just great.
You good?
Hi, Alain.
What's up? You often come here?
- Since I was a kid.
- I'd no idea.
We'll run into each other.
I rented a place with 2 buddies.
We plan to have some fun.
- This is your house?
- Yes.
You're selling?
Shit, of course!
I heard about the Trocadero deal.
A clusterfuck.
And you're the cautious type.
Anyway, we all screw up sometime.
It's tough right now, for everyone.
Wanna show me around?
I could well be interested.
No.
Let's see if there's anything
in the fridge. If not...
As expected.
"Warning!"
So...
"Switch off the gas.
"Do not adjust the radiator settings.
"Do not touch the wine.
- "Do not smoke..."
- Vero, who are they?
Can I help you?
Sorry, it looked empty.
On the way up from the beach,
the gate was open, so we came in.
You just walk in people's houses?
I am so sorry. My name's Alain.
This is Frank and Xavier.
- I'm friends with your husband.
- Ex-husband!
Sorry, I didn't know.
I'm a restaurateur, too.
I ran into him and he said, take a look.
I just wanted to show my friends.
I'm interested,
so I wanted their opinion.
Interested by what exactly?
Yes, hello.
Max, I'm at the house.
What the hell is going on?
You put it up for sale?
Without a word to me or the kids?
You always said it'd be theirs one day.
You must be shitting me!
Look, Vero, start by toning it down.
And quit guilt-tripping me.
I do as I please.
Did you buy the house?
Do you pay for maintenance?
Just listen to yourself!
I spent over twenty years here.
We built it together.
I raised the kids here.
We drew up the plans together.
Screw your maintenance!
You're obsessed with money.
What the hell are you planning?
You'd sell your pride and joy?
Listen to me. I do not...
I do not need to justify myself!
You left me, remember.
I'm cool, leaving the house for you
and your nympho bitch friend.
Don't give me shit.
I do as I please!
Got it?
Not as you please.
We're not divorced yet.
I want a divorce!
Don't say that about Geraldine!
Where are you?
You told the kids to lie?
You're a pain in the ass, Max.
A never-ending pain in the ass.
Know what?
You'll croak all alone with your money.
Asshole!
I'm really sorry, I totally goofed.
I feel awful, setting this off.
No worries.
I'd have found out
one way or another.
We'll be going maybe.
We're around the corner
if you need anything. The door's open.
If ever you want to come over
for a neighborly drink...
It will be a great pleasure.
Now maybe?
It'll do you good.
Sabine, Max, Isabelle...
Jean-Louis, of course.
I knew I'd forgotten someone.
Got any vodka?
Something strong?
I'm on it.
You're doing great, buddy.
Just keep going.
My turn!
Am I...
A man, I asked. Am I tall?
No!
- We don't know.
- Good point.
- You're always seated.
- Don't tell him.
Too late. Seated? Wolf Blitzer!
Drink!
Good guess, Blitzer!
So I'm...
a woman, American...
rich...
Oprah Winfrey!
No! Drink.
Wowser!
I'm seeing things.
I never saw him like this.
Rest assured, us neither.
Stop before we puke.
Get a room!
Shame on you! Out!
You're super sexy
when you're bombed. I love it!
Marie, drink. You lost!
She loses on purpose to drink.
For sure.
Ok, I'm a woman, 50, blonde.
Hot? Little bit hot?
No, not hot!
Drink!
I didn't guess a name, so no.
- You don't guess, you don't drink.
- Drink!
Only if I guess wrong.
- I didn't lose!
- Guess a name!
Screw you and your stupid rules.
The real rules...
Please!
I called and texted you for 30 mins!
Four times,
your shouting has woken Mila.
Don't you get it? I'm tired!
I can't take any more!
I need to sleep. Get it into your heads!
You're paying me to die here?
I'm not an animal or a robot.
You're gonna put me on a drip?
I'm sorry. We didn't realize, Catherine.
Anyway, we're going to bed, right?
We're sorry, we didn't realize.
Sorry, really.
I won't come back down.
No, Catherine.
Goodnight, Catherine.
I know. I know who I am.
I'm Catherine!
Drink!
The guy asks what's going on?
"You took the t-shirt!"
I'm sorry.
Thank you, Alain. Thank you so much.
It's the first time
I've had such fun here.
It's true. I always loved the place,
but it's always been stress,
comments, rules.
He gave me such shit!
It feels so good to laugh.
Thank you, Alain.
It's criminal not to have fun
in this house.
Too bad it's not for sale.
We're open to discussion.
Really?
Just one thing,
I come with the house.
For real?
Can we have Geraldine, too?
I come for free.
Now that calls for one last bottle.
- Alright?
- No way!
He'll go ballistic.
- Great.
- He'll go bonkers.
If he finds out we drank his wine.
No, Alain!
Picture his face when he finds out
I banged his wife.
I found this.
Château Lynch-Bages, 1982.
Dare we?
You bet!
That's looking good. Very good.
A dream fulfilled.
I feel like dancing.
Goodness, you have rhythm in your blood.
Swear to god, your body's a vine.
You're cracked!
- I can't keep making the same movie.
- Sure you can.
Give people what they want.
No, make the right choices
for the right reasons.
Max, don't drink that.
Know what, it's shit.
I used to drink it.
Guess what they found.
Quartz in my colon. Honestly.
Sure it wasn't Alex's watch?
Buddy, I'm cracking jokes,
but I really like Alex. He's great.
And it's good to see you so happy.
- Alex is great, right?
- Yeah.
Thanks, buddy.
Eric!
Two chicks recognized me
from the Kopnaieff film.
They saw it in Bordeaux.
They remembered my police station scene.
One of them said,
I'd got the cop attitude down.
It's cool. After all the work I put in.
And it's not easy without dialogue.
Feels weird being recognized.
Can I invite them over?
No.
The problem in France
is you're typecast in a particular role,
whereas I tend to see myself
as more versatile.
In the USA,
it's slightly different but...
We're gonna go.
See you.
That's pleasant.
It's great to drink!
- Tomorrow's your parachute jump?
- Yeah.
Count me in!
Too much pressure.
I gotta let it out, let it all out!
I love ya!
Same here.
You'll love it, it's insane.
It's wild when that plane door opens.
The air rushes in...
She's a changed woman.
It's awesome to see her like that.
Yeah.
She's super self-confident.
And she's great with Vincent.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Why aren't you always like this?
Like what?
Talking softly, sweetly,
not shouting and yelling.
If you remember, you asked me to whisper.
Why are you always angry?
Who are you so mad at?
You're gonna keep it up for long?
Tending a shitty bar in Rennes?
That's your life?
Hey, poor man's George Clooney,
you doing well
doesn't make our lives shit.
- I'm very happy.
- You're very happy?
Yeah.
You're so happy you drink all day.
Right?
Look at how you behave with Nino.
You yell at him,
you're always pissed off.
In 3 days here,
you haven't spent one hour with him.
You constantly dump him
on someone else.
You were gonna save humankind,
now you can't look after your son?
If the world's messed up,
don't blame him.
You know what childcare is
with a full-time nanny?
You're worse than me.
Yeah, I struggle with him.
The kid personifies
all I hate in the world.
I'm not free anymore.
Drives me nuts.
Free to do what? I don't get it.
You'd prefer being on your own?
End up on your own?
You spout that shit
'cause you can't make it work with a guy.
It's going on eight years.
Anyone mentions Ludo,
you burst into tears.
That's not true.
What?
It's a problem for you
that I miss him?
It's a problem for you
that I can't live without him?
Yes, it's a problem for me.
I want you to be happy.
So quit busting my balls
if you want me to be happy.
Alright.
You don't want me then?
How long will you keep trying?
Until you understand.
You complete numbskull!
It's bullshit. You're out of your mind.
No.
I could never be with a guy like you.
Never ever.
And you couldn't bear a chick like me.
Sure, your big mouth might be an issue
but I could make an effort,
find a compromise
and accept who you are,
with all your flaws.
Stop it.
- If you touch me, I swear...
- What?
I swear...
What?
Eric!
- Quit yelling.
- He's always...
You tell me to whisper,
then holler like...
I don't believe it.
What? What do you want?
Pisses me off always, everywhere.
Holy fucking shit!
- Ok?
- Sure.
Max, stop! You'll catch your death!
My carriage! He'll give us a ride.
This could be tricky.
Seriously, put something on.
Thanks for a marvelous evening.
Thank you. It was great.
Really cool.
See you tomorrow.
For a barbecue?
No kidding, we're gonna barbecue.
Why don't you give me the keys?
I'm going to bed.
I think I'll walk Xavier home.
Do you mind?
See you later.
No, maybe tomorrow.
Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
- No problem.
Goodnight.
Not here.
- It's wrong.
- And so right.
This is crazy.
You make me go crazy.
I'm losing control. Alain, stop!
Iggy Pop, bedtime.
Come on, sweetie.
Shit, come on.
I'll never get him upstairs.
Hold on, I'll help.
I'm going to bed too.
Pull him back on the chair.
On 3, you tilt him forward.
One... Two...
And tilt.
Watch out, he'll barf.
His ass!
Goodnight.
See you.
Goodnight.
Me too, I'm out on my feet.
Right, we don't wanna push it.
I'm gonna watch a movie.
Yeah, actually...
A movie's a good idea.
With all the booze, I'll never sleep.
See anything you like?
I don't know.
You?
I don't know.
How about Love Actually?
Stop it.
Keep away from me.
Honestly, so we don't piss people off
with the noise,
we should watch it in my room.
Of course.
I think it's better that way.
The best course of action.
Yes?
Yes, it's Vincent.
- Bad time?
- No.
What's wrong?
Something occurred to me.
I was thinking earlier, in the club,
and not only in the club
'cause for some time...
I'm not sure how I can explain it.
You just seem transformed.
You've changed and...
What I mean is that...
As time goes by...
Sometimes you make choices
'cause there are moments in life...
See what I mean?
Not quite.
It's not like I'm reconsidering
what I have with Alex. I love him truly.
But...
What I mean is, the more I look at you,
the more beautiful you are.
I'm still very attracted to you.
I don't know what to say.
You've taken me by surprise.
I had too much to drink.
I should never have come here
talking about this.
It's...
It's really important to talk.
Yes.
But I have no right to do this.
No right, no right?
You have every right...
How you feeling?
You made us coffee?
The machine's there.
I see.
So it's help yourself, is it?
You're funny!
Alright, feeling ok?
I don't know.
Wait, I'm coming too.
Really?
Yes, really!
Is that normal, the weird noise?
- Is it normal?
- It's odd.
- A problem, Pascal?
- The engine.
You gotta be stupid to say that.
Freaking out's normal, right?
Why'd I be reassured
about jumping from a plane at 200 km/h?
It's not good to get agitated in a plane.
You're stressed out, fine.
But you're one of a group.
You must not communicate
your stress to others.
Relax and you'll have a blast.
You can trust me on that. C'mon!
We're good.
Head like that.
In position.
I'm gonna scream
like I haven't screamed for ages.
Don't worry, that's what it's for.
Ready?
- Head back.
- Yeah, got it.
All good?
Yeah, ok.
I don't want to die.
Me neither.
Are you ok?
You feel ok?
Calm down.
Keep your legs up.
Shit, I let go.
I let everything go!
I let it all go, all of it!
Thank you, buddy.
It was awesome.
I let go, I was like...
I felt like I was flying.
I wasn't scared.
Not even at the start.
When the plane takes off.
I wasn't scared, I was...
A man with wings.
No way!
Let me see.
They make adult diapers.
Look at that face.
You took a shower there?
Sure.
It's healthy,
his body releasing tension and toxins.
It's a great image.
Let me see him piss himself.
Enough! Elliot give that back.
No phones at the table.
I just wanted to see the video.
I have a secret for you.
Come
and hear a super secret.
- Why should I?
- Because it's super!
Alright.
Come here, pumpkin.
If you're good, we'll go sailing later.
Not with him!
Him, no!
Excuse me, who's having crab?
The crab? That's Sabine.
Me.
Ok, Marie?
Yeah, great.
I'm still high from the jump.
It was wild.
See that? Awesome, isn't it?
What a feeling!
I told you, you get hooked.
It was dope.
Sport is addictive.
Your body releases endorphins
that cheer you up.
I told you. Adrenaline!
You prefer adrenaline in a syringe.
Quick shot?
Granny, this afternoon
can I invite my friend over?
Yes, of course.
I'll ask mom.
Mommy, can I go to a friend's house?
We'll see.
It doesn't matter.
Did you enjoy it?
All good?
Perfect, as ever.
Wonderful. Thank you so much.
Max, no worries, let me get it.
I'm not worried.
I'm just saying I'll get it.
I can get it. What's the problem?
It's no problem, I just want to.
I want to, too.
My birthday, my call.
Guys, know what? How about we share it?
So everybody pays.
I ate lots and Sabine had salad.
For 20 years,
I paid, no one complained.
Now, you want to divide it up.
Bullshit! See you outside.
Max, stop it, will you?
Max, I'll get it.
There you go, problem solved.
- Olivier, can I pay?
- Right away.
Why take it like that?
What was that allusion?
What allusion?
I said keep a lid on it.
Nobody noticed.
I just wanted to treat you all.
Classy way of doing it.
You wanna grouch about it? Grouch.
That's not at all what I meant,
you know.
Now I'm the grouch?
Enjoy it?
Super.
Card declined.
Another one maybe?
I don't get it.
It's no problem.
I'll put it on a tab.
Stop by when you can.
Have a good day.
I'm not taking it personally,
I don't care.
- Before heading back, I need a walk.
- And get back how?
Maybe I'll stop by Nassim's.
He'll drive me.
- You're sure?
- Yeah.
Take it easy.
Thanks, Max.
What's wrong?
He said he's going to see Nassim.
Really?
Great, so we don't have to tell him.
We go see her?
Not a good idea if he doesn't know.
He'll be pissed off if he finds out.
Do what you want, I'll head back.
Jeanne! Nino!
Come bake cakes with me.
Do I text her then?
- Catherine?
- In a jeep, with a baby?
In this cold?
Maybe if you hold her.
I'll bring Mila.
I'll take Mila with me in the car.
That way...
At this time, not a chance.
- We're...
- She needs a nap.
Bad Mary Poppins!
In the car, it's warmer...
She needs to sleep.
- I'd love to...
- No!
It's an issue. In terms of naps.
She needs to sleep. Let's go.
- We forget the bike ride?
- We'll go afterward.
- There's the birthday party to prepare.
- True.
Never mind.
- It's what we said.
- No, we're good.
Girls!
We'll come another time.
He wants to go biking.
We want to go biking.
Catherine, we can give you a ride.
Thank you very much.
Careful.
- Let's fold this.
- No!
Don't fold it
with the baby inside.
Coming!
Here I am!
I am so happy to see you all!
Same here.
- How are you?
- Hey.
- You ok?
- Hi, Vero.
- You had lunch? We're so late.
- We just ate.
Really? I didn't get that.
I invited the neighbors.
They're pretty dickish, actually.
Really?
He puts the house up for sale.
I mean, come on!
You ok, Max?
You burned it up.
Isn't it beautiful?
Last night, where did you go?
Where did I go?
I'm not stupid.
You got home at 4
and to bed at 6:15.
You keep tabs on me now?
Don't do that again, ok?
You consider her your wife?
She's my son's mother.
I spent 14 years of my life with her.
That kinda makes her
the love of my life.
It changes nothing between us.
Wait!
That's not what I meant!
Shit!
It's crazy, him not telling Sabine.
You knew he was selling?
No.
It's Vero's side of the story.
You ok, Max?
Anybody seen Alex?
Something wrong, fella?
What happened? Are you hurt?
I could have died.
You left me all alone, deserted me.
Not at all.
I pedaled like crazy,
I looked for you, I called.
Your phone rang on the bed,
like you were back.
Sorry, the gate was open.
Your friend tried to commit suicide
off the dock.
Shit!
Buddy! Hey!
Take the rope off him.
Easy does it.
Children, stay up there.
Why?
- Elliot, go back up.
- We're going sailing.
Don't argue, just go!
Go back up there!
- It's unfair.
- Eric said he'd take us.
It's ok now.
Sweetheart, we're here.
What happened, sweetheart?
How could you do that?
What if the tide was out?
In or out, the rope was too long.
I'm sorry. I lied to you.
I was scared of losing you.
Anyway...
I've lost everything now.
I ran into a big problem
on the Trocadero deal.
I should have kept out of that.
After we all fell out...
I struggled to get over it.
I guess I felt
I had something to prove.
I became reckless.
I borrowed heavily.
Until the banks cut me loose.
Insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy.
I had to sell the hotel.
The restaurant.
I put the house up for sale.
What?
It'll be sold this month.
Ask them. They know.
I saw you all with Vero.
I turn my back
and you dash over to Vero's.
What a sight you made.
Before my eyes, all I had lost.
My wife, my house, my friends.
A beautiful image of failure.
You came to celebrate that?
60 years of failure?
Where do I fit in here?
No, don't get me wrong.
I didn't mean you.
If you hadn't been there,
I doubt I could've stuck it out.
I couldn't talk
or let you see me like that.
Like a loser, a failure.
Sorry. I'm really sorry.
A year now, running on fumes.
Trying to bounce back, but I can't.
Can't even hang myself. I'm pathetic.
I didn't rent this house.
Eric did.
I pretended it was me.
It was him.
I don't get why you all came back.
I don't get it.
Why the sudden concern for me?
Max, you were always there for us.
We want to be there for you.
Yes, I guess.
Friends forever, in this together.
It's bullshit.
Why bother fixing
something that's broken?
I don't agree with you.
Real friends aren't always there,
just when it counts.
You need us now and we're all here
to say how much we love you.
I'm tired.
You're in depression.
It's perfectly normal.
You shut so much out.
Now it's all blowing up.
And turning 60, that's a real bummer.
I mean, it awaits us all.
Get yourself together.
You can't give up like that.
You can't sell up.
That house was your dream.
You promised it to your kids.
Yes, it's a dumb idea. Forget it.
Do you really think
I don't want to keep the house?
It's not that simple.
Your life was never simple, Max.
You need me to remind you?
Flat broke, working the oyster beds
every summer for a pittance.
Remember how proud your dad was
when he saw your house.
Accept this fucking failure.
Accept your separation.
I don't care
if you're penniless, sweetheart.
I don't care.
Alright?
I wanted to say I'm leaving.
Frankly, it's incomprehensible.
A suicide!
You're sick in this house.
Suicide in front of children.
Beat it!
Pardon me?
Beat it. I've had enough.
You think I need someone
to look after my daughter?
I don't need anyone. Just fucking go.
Of course, vulgarity now.
Shut it.
How's that? Shut the fuck up!
Have you seen the kids?
The movie room?
Vincent just checked.
- They took the catamaran.
- What?
- They took the cat.
- No!
- What do you mean, they took it?
- They took it.
No way.
- Can Arthur sail?
- A bit.
They won't be far. I'll go.
I'll follow in my boat.
I'll call to tell you where.
I'll come with.
Shit, I just fired dopey.
I'll look after Mila.
- You don't mind?
- No.
A bottle in 15 minutes.
Thanks, Sabine.
Throw the rope.
- What's that boat?
- His boat.
Where's the Max? The yacht?
He sold it.
He got this instead.
He says the other was too Parisian.
This one's better for here,
goes everywhere.
No sign of them in the bay.
I guess they headed farther out.
We'll split up.
You head for the Reserve.
I'll take the channels.
Got a CB?
My phone. Same difference.
Not exactly.
Let's go. Keep your eyes peeled.
Hold on tight, I'm gonna open her up.
My boat's no piece of shit!
Sit down. It's pointless and dangerous.
I'm holding tight.
Is this normal?
It's nothing major.
Hold on.
What are you doing there?
- You ok?
- I'm fine.
I was caught off guard but I'm fine.
It's not as cold as it looks.
It's nothing.
The valve must have come unscrewed.
- So where's the valve?
- I don't know.
Anyway, you're safe.
These boats are unsinkable.
Unsinkable, my ass!
It's filling with water. We're sinking.
I'll weigh anchor
and find something to bail us out.
Shit!
Can't swim in a down jacket.
How do ducks do it?
What's the problem?
There is no problem. Bail out.
You got a problem?
No, there's no problem.
It's just the air pressure.
In the rightside inflatable.
Jump aboard, no time.
It'll be dark in an hour.
I can't leave it here.
Go ahead, Max. I have no kids.
Too immature, apparently.
Doomed to be single.
If anyone's dying today, it's me.
It's unsinkable.
Bail it out, pump it up
and it's all good.
The keys are here.
We can't leave him alone.
True, cut the crap. Come on!
No worries. It's all poor Max has left.
Can't let it sink.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
You know, Max,
real friends don't count when...
I mean, real friends
aren't there when it counts...
Real friends aren't all there.
Don't worry, I get it.
Antoine, you're anchored.
Don't move. You're on our GPS.
We'll be back.
Alright, go.
Pump it up!
Pump before you bail. Pump!
Yes, I know that.
Where's the valve?
The valve?
- Look at water level.
- I am doing.
The waves and current
mean you see intermittently.
They can't have gone this far.
Not this far, it's madness.
Over there!
Hold on, we're going over.
They capsized!
Here we are!
I don't see Nino.
Eric, I don't see Nino.
Arthur, where's Nino?
He drifted off that way.
How long ago?
I don't know.
He had a jacket?
Yes.
Watch out, don't hurt yourself!
Did that hurt?
Where did he go? Where?
That way.
That way!
No, the other way.
The other way!
Arthur said he went that way.
The current's turned, the tide's rising.
Arthur said so.
Trust me. The tide has turned.
He said it was that way.
He's wrong.
He must have gone with the current.
I lost hold of him.
The current was too strong.
Fuck!
I swear to god, Eric. Trust me.
Mayday! Mayday!
Man overboard. 7-year-old kid.
Mayday to all ships!
All ships in the area, join search.
Boy, 7 years old.
Wetsuit.
Fuck it!
Stand by the cabin, kids inside.
It's bumpy.
You hear that?
There he is!
I can't go farther.
It's the edge of the channels.
With the boat, it's too dangerous.
We'll end up in the drink.
Let me go!
Vincent!
Take the wheel.
Quick! Keep it steady
and back up gently when I say so.
I get it. Let go.
We're going to get him.
We're going to get him
but the current's strong.
Let go of me.
I get it.
Shit!
Nino!
I'm coming!
I'm here.
I'm here.
We're good.
Hold tight, don't let go.
Don't let go. Look at me.
Nino, give me your hand.
Throw him the rope there.
Eric, you ok?
- The current took you.
- It sucked me away.
I was so scared, baby.
It's all over now.
Let's go. They'll catch cold.
- What about Antoine?
- Shit, Antoine.
We'll go afterward.
Wait, I hear something.
Where?
Over there!
Here we go.
Jean-Louis, that way!
There he is!
What a chump!
What the hell did you do?
You ok?
Help.
Alright, buddy?
I'm sorry, Max.
I couldn't save it.
It went so fast. I bailed like crazy
and it sank like a stone.
Come on.
Closer.
You know my buddy, Antoine the koala?
Come on.
You're sure it's the right call?
You want us to come?
I appreciate it,
but I have to do it alone.
Except I'm not alone.
Take care of yourself.
Antoine, no.
- I've got it.
- No.
I've got it, I said.
We're gonna stop all that stuff.
They're right. It sucks.
Come on.
You'll stop paying me, too?
I can't pay you
to be my buddy, right?
I don't know, depends.
Don't force it.
You drive. I'm beat.
Am I driving
as your buddy or assistant?
As my buddy.
I won't pay you for it.
So, same as before but unpaid?
Yeah, that's right.
What about the dining table?
Same. I said I'd leave it.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Great! Sold really fast, after all.
I think I'll wait outside for them.
They're here. Talk of the devil.
I'll go get them.
- How are you?
- Very well. And you?
Mr. Cantara.
The Lagrange family.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.
It's a real thrill.
We looked for so long.
This is our third visit.
Every time we come,
it feels so obvious.
Shit, it's beautiful.
Paul, Antoine, no!
Look, along the fence. Right there.
No, it'd be better the other way around.
We want to put in a pool.
I plan to pave all this,
install a big pool,
and lose the lawn. I hate lawns!
If we paint that one,
we need to paint the others opposite.
We'll paint the cabins white.
A hint of Starck!
Paul! Antoine!
Let's get this over with.
Yes, quite.
The stake is right by the fence
where you'll put your pool.
I see. In the vegetation, right?
Allow me to read the sale agreement.
Stop me if there's a mistake.

Excuse me.
Yes?
I must ask you to leave.
- Beg pardon?
- The house is no longer for sale.
I don't understand.
There's nothing to understand.
Thank you.
It's the contract?
It's a fantastic contract. Let's go.
Come on.
I don't get it.
I'm a busy man.
I came from Paris to sign for this.
I'm talking to you.
Intolerable.
I don't understand, Mr. Cantara.
Hello, it's Max.
Where are you all?
