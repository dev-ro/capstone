Shit!
Shit!
Oh, fucking Christ on a stick!
Shit.
Hello?
Is anybody there?
Is anybody home?
My car broke down.
I could use some help.
Hello?
Hello?
So you're just gonna suffer!
Or I will end this right now!
Do you hear me?
Special agent Francis,
I presume?
Pleased to meet you,
deputy salter.
Uh, you can call me Colt.
Everybody does.
Did you want to grab a bite
before we hit the station?
Marnie's serves up the best chicken
fried steak you ever tasted.
- I'm vegan.
- Okay.
Uh, great. Well, I'll just grab
somethin' later.
- I'll take that for ya.
- Shall we go then?
Yeah. I'll get that
for you, ma'am.
Hey, Colt.
What's crackalackin'?
Jenna, this is
special agent Francis.
- The sheriff around?
- Oh, how you doing?
No, he's still out. Should be
back soon though.
We had an appointment
for 1:00.
You just take a seat, sweetie
and I'm sure he won't be long.
Okay. I'm gonna get some
coffee. Anybody want anything?
Two splendas, no cream, please.
- Sheriff.
- Yeah, hang on, hon.
Jenna, you got any of those
wet naps back there?
- You betcha!
- Colt!
A little friend for you
out there in the trunk.
Okay. Right on it,
sheriff.
You better get
the hand truck for Colt.
That idiot's gonna realize
it's gonna be too much weight
for him to shift himself.
Special agent Francis.
How you doing?
We've been expecting you.
Pleasure to meet you, sheriff.
I'm sorry, you seem
to have caught us
right in the middle of our
local crime spree.
Hit-and-run white tail.
Yeah.
Step on into the back
see what we can do you for.
There you go.
Have a seat.
Here it is.
Not much to it.
Pretty much a waste of yours
and the bureau's time,
if you ask me.
I'd like to speak
to him first thing.
- Who? Pritchard?
- Mm.
Colt and I were just out there
three days ago to see him
have a look around.
His wife's car is missing.
Other than that, nothing
out of the ordinary.
It's all right there.
In the report.
I see that.
But I'd still like to get my
own sense of the man.
It's odd, he didn't file
the report.
- Her sister did, right?
- That's right.
Maria and the boy were
on the way to her house
so Theresa would've been
the first one to notice
that they'd gone missing.
Mm-hm.
I've known Jackson Pritchard
his whole life.
Colt there went to
high school with the man.
Yeah, I know, he's got a temper
but he is not a murderer
by any stretch.
Who said anything about murder?
Although now that you mention it,
45 percent of all murdered women
are killed by their
domestic partner.
You wanna know
the most likely scenario?
Maria finally got a bellyful
of his bullshit
and she lit off with the kid for
Minneapolis or Winnipeg or --
Without telling her sister? Or anyone?
That doesn't seem right.
Why don't you go out and
question the sister then?
I'm pretty sure
she'll agree with me.
But leave Pritchard out of it.
There's a valid line of inquiry
that needs to be followed up on.
We have done
the follow-up, agent.
Look, I know my department's
under scrutiny right now
but give us a shred of credit
for understanding our community
and how to do our goddamn jobs.
So, how about we trust my instinct
on this one, special agent Francis?
Yours didn't seem to do that
Breeland girl any favors.
Sheriff, Rudolph
is in the ice box.
Colt, take our distinguished
guest out to see Theresa Locke
and then get her set up
at the Kelly inn.
Right on it.
Ma'am? Ready to go?
Despite what happened to the
Breeland girl, sheriff, I found her.
And I wouldn't change that.
Apparently, some people
are just better off
not being found.
Stop it!
You stop!
You stop!
Huh? This is your fault!
Your fault you're in here!
You understand?
So you're just gonna
suffer in silence!
Or I will end this right now!
- Uh, you can't smoke in here.
- I don't.
What're the smokes for, then?
I quit three years ago.
I keep that around to remind me.
Mm. Okay.
He's a caribou,
you know, not a deer.
- Who?
- Rudolph.
Reindeer is what they
call them in Europe.
The caribou and deer are both
from the Cervidae family.
That's Latin for deer.
Heck, the moose, also
known as the Eurasian elk
is technically a deer, too.
It's more than just cow chips and
inbreeding out here, you know.
Well played, deputy salter.
You know, that's got to be pretty
exciting to compete with this
thrill-a-minute
landscape.
Hm?
Oh, sorry, I was just surfing.
I was just yankin' your chain.
No, you're right.
It's a rude habit.
So, what did you want
to talk about?
Okay. You asked.
What was all that talk back
there about the Breeland girl?
Should I be concerned?
Wow.
You're right.
I did ask.
If you don't wanna talk
about it, it's okay.
Seventeen-year-old
Tanya Breeland
went missing about a year ago.
It was the first real case
I was lead on.
Took all kinds of
unpaid overtime, weekends.
I was little obsessed,
I guess you could say.
Four months later, I tracked
her down to a homeless shelter
run by an Islamist group
in St. Paul.
The kicker was, the girl
didn't wanna go home.
She wouldn't say why.
Psych eval was perfectly normal.
Clean drug screen too.
So I just took her home.
She showed up at my office.
Said I ruined her life.
Call 9-1-1!
It all happened so fast.
I couldn't stop her.
I couldn't save her.
Good lord.
I was more focused on
solving the case
than making sure she was safe.
To protect and serve.
It's a pretty basic
concept to follow.
It sounds like
you went by the book.
Well, then the book needed
to be rewritten
and I should have seen that.
Is that what brings you
out here?
Administrative reassignment
or whatever they call it?
No. Actually, I requested
this case when it came in.
You know, you can't
beat yourself up.
If you were perfect,
you wouldn't be human.
No! You..
You are not allowed!
I will not be made a fool of!
I have seen your true face now.
I know what you really are.
Sorry. The, uh,
the milk's gone sour.
Oh, no, that's fine.
Thanks, Theresa.
So, this is a regular thing?
E -- e -- excuse me?
Your sister and her son
staying here.
You expected them
five days ago, right?
Yeah, uh, thereabouts.
Jon -- Jonah had the flu,
so we..
They were gonna come by a --
As soon as he got better, um..
Oh, I wouldn't call it
a -- a regular thing.
They, they, they just come by when
they need to get away for a spell.
Get away? How so?
Life can get pretty dreary out there
at that place of theirs, you know?
Could you be more specific?
The farm hasn't turned
to profit for years.
The old house is falling apart.
Times are tough.
It... Gets stressful.
And Mr. Pritchard, is he
a source of that stress
in your opinion?
I know he's
a friend of yours, Colt.
That was 15 years ago.
We have more of a smile and nod
kind of a relationship now.
It's okay.
Well, him and me never
really got along well
and, um, he's been in the
county lock-up more than once.
Uh, drunk and disorderly,
simple assault.
Yeah, but, but in
the last couple of years.
I, I don't know, he's just..
He's changed,
he's sullen all the time.
He -- he, he..
His temper's getting worse.
I mean, the littlest thing
will set him off.
Could you give me an example?
One time, Jonah
spilled some paint on the porch
and Jackson dragged the boy
into his room and locked him in
overnight without supper.
He -- he, he wouldn't, he wouldn't
even let him go to the bathroom.
Maria was livid
like I've never seen.
I mean, after everything
that's happened
that boy is her precious
little miracle.
How do you mean?
Well, they -- they got
married real young
on account of Maria
being pregnant
but she lost that baby.
And after that she suffered..
I don't know,
half a dozen miscarriages
before she finally got Jonah.
Oh, I see.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What about Jackson Pritchard
attracted her
in the first place?
He was an upright,
churchgoing man.
The Pritchard's weren't rich, but
they owned their land outright.
And... She bought
all that talk about
it being blessed and all.
Blessed?
Jonah was her reward
from god for keeping the faith
is what she said.
Can you think of any reason
why your sister
might take off somewhere
and not tell you?
Not a chance,
no, she, she told me
if she changes the channel.
And Jonah,
he likes staying here?
Sure,
we got a -- we got a, uh
playground down the road, um,
a bunch of kids his age.
I -- I've even made him
a little place for him
to sleep, you know, like a..
A little nook that he can,
he can make his own.
Could I see it?
Maria and me'd take my bed
and he'd sleep in there.
The closet?
He preferred it
to being out in the open.
He said it made him feel safer.
That man is a monster!
Grandma, you shouldn't be up.
You ask him what he did.
You ask him what he did with
Maria and little Jonah.
- You ask him.
- It's okay. It's okay.
If they die on that land
their souls will never
find rest.
Nobody's died, okay? These
people are here to help.
Don't you worry. Don't you worry.
We're gonna..
We're gonna find
Maria and Jonah.
You are, aren't you?
Doesn't leave us a whole
lot of options, does it?
No. No, it doesn't.
Wait.
What are you talkin' about?
Get in.
We have to check out
Jackson Pritchard now.
We've almost certainly got enough
probable cause for a search warrant --
Whoa, whoa.
Ease it back there.
Look, I agree that what Theresa
said raises some questions
but I mean, I've already
been out there.
And the sheriff was pretty clear
about leaving Jackson be for now.
I think that we should
look for Maria's car
and recheck the hospitals.
Meanwhile, who knows what he could
be doing to Maria and her son.
It's his son, too.
Remember that.
They've just been through
some tough times.
Economic hardship does
crazy things to people.
I ran track with Jackson.
He was always serious, and
more than a little weird..
...but he's a good man
at his core. I know it.
You heard what Ms. Locke said
about his abusive behavior.
- Yeah, but..
- Look at this.
Does that look like
the work of a kid
who feels safe
around his father?
Shouldn't that be bagged
for evidence?
Whatever you think
you know about Pritchard
could determine the fate
of two people, deputy salter.
Okay, so the Pritchard place is way
out on the other side of the county
but if we're not back right away, the
sheriff's gonna know something's up.
If we do this,
I gotta put a call in.
You already know
what he's gonna say.
Haven't you ever heard it's
easier to beg for forgiveness
than ask for permission?
- I heard it the other way around.
- Still.
What are you gonna do
when he tells you no?
He's already told me no.
We all know that I was called in for
a reason, your sheriff most of all.
I'll take full responsibility.
This is Pritchard's place.
Stop the car.
Is this Pritchard's?
Not that I know of.
The battery must be dead.
Who abandons all their stuff in an
unlocked car and leaves the keys?
It's a nice car.
You guys go to the right place?
Does this look normal to you?
This is all new.
It wasn't nearly
this crazy three days ago.
Stay here.
I'll talk to him first.
Gate's locked.
Hey, Jackson!
It's Colt salter! You in there?
I want to ask you
a few questions.
Jackson?
Hey, I'm going around back.
You wanna grab a handheld
from inside the glove box?
- Radio check.
- Loud and clear.
Son of a bitch.
Unless you want that car to get brain
paint job, keep your hands up!
Up! Where I can see 'em.
Come on. Get 'em up!
I'm special agent Francis,
Mr. Pritchard.
You made a mistake coming here.
I'm here investigating the
disappearance of your wife and son.
You do want me to find them,
don't you, Mr. Pritchard?
Well, they ain't in here.
So come on. Get walkin'.
That's your wife's car,
isn't it, Mr. Pritchard?
What's it doing here if you told the
police she went to her sister's?
Shut up!
Jackson, hey,
don't do anything stupid.
Although, I'd put
threatening to shoot
a federal agent right up
there with stupid.
Both of you need to clear
off my property, right now!
You know why we're here. Give me the
gun, we'll talk about it, okay?
No, Colt!
You take this woman
and you leave.
That's not gonna happen,
Mr. Pritchard. Not now.
Jackson, she's right.
Okay? Think about it.
Now, I know you're
not gonna shoot her
and you sure as heck
not gonna shoot me
but if you do, Gruenwell will
be here with the whole army.
You remember when he caught us
tp-ing Jenny Ostlund's house?
You'd have thought he had Al
Capone surrounded. Right?
- Hands on your head!
- Hey.
I said, hands on your head!
Easy with the gun, okay?
Get on your knees!
Cuff him.
I said, cuff him, deputy salter!
Yes, ma'am.
Where are they, Pritchard?
They ain't here.
That's the gospel truth.
Her car is still
on the property.
We're 50 miles from nowhere.
They didn't just
walk out of here.
What the heck was that?
I'm searching this house.
You keep an eye on this
lying son of a bitch.
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.
Oh, I'm sure
you don't want me to.
You both need to clear off my
property, or as god is my witness
I will not be responsible
for what happens!
Colt, you..
If she goes in there
Maria and Jonah
are as good as dead.
Don't you mind my dog Earl.
He's the least of your worries.
Jesus Christ.
The entryway looks clear.
I'm gonna check upstairs first.
Okay, copy.
Deputy salter, can you read me?
Uh, not too clearly, no.
I'm heading downstairs.
I'm checking down
in the basement.
Agent Francis, I'm havin' a
hard time reading you.
Do you read me? Over.
What was that?
Hey! You tell -- you tell
her to stop, alright?
You tell her to come back
out right now!
Down!
Give me your hands.
I told you not to do
anything stupid, Jackson.
Not cool.
Just a little hiccup.
I got it under control.
Get up. Come on.
Mr. Pritchard,
care to explain what exactly
you've got down there
in the basement?
You know... In the cage?
- It's not them, is it?
- No, it's not a family member.
Although you tell me,
Mr. Pritchard.
Experiment
with the livestock much?
- You shut your mouth.
- Then tell me what it is!
It is a servant
of the beast. A demon.
A demon?
You're not a church-going woman
to say it like that
otherwise you'd know that the
devil, he used to be an angel
until he was cast out,
and you'd know that
sometimes you can't tell
the difference
between a good angel
and a fallen one.
Whatever you do believe,
whatever you choose to call that
it is evil.
Yeah, one just like it
took my wife and son
and I mean to use it
to get my, my family back.
Took your wife and son?
- And you're holding that one hostage?
- That's right.
Hey, will someone tell me
what's goin' on?
Mr. Pritchard here has
some kind of deformed
sickly wild animal
down there, in the cage.
From where, I have no idea.
And what the hell
is that lump of jelly?
It was covered in it
when I captured it
and then it sloughed off
after a day or two.
It was covered in it?
Yeah, it was wearing it like
like some kind of skin or suit.
You know any wild animals
that wear suits, lady?
Okay, I don't know what kind
of game you're playing here.
Mr. Pritchard, but spouting gibberish
is not going to absolve you
of whatever responsibility
you have in all of this.
But I'll bite,
how the hell did you even
capture that thing?
I ain't tellin' you shit.
You are correct, sir. You have
the right to remain silent.
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law --
You're arresting me?
For what?
You're kidding me, right?
Assault on
a peace officer, for one.
Make that two.
Get in.
My phone is dead.
I'm not surprised, you can't
get a signal out here.
No, it's completely bricked.
Mine too.
Okay. We better just transport him
and call it in from the road.
Don't even tell me.
This car was serviced last week.
There's no way
the battery's dead.
Hey! You brought this
on yourself.
I tried to warn ya!
And maybe someone
tends' for me to stay.
Maybe that someone
is ready to bargain.
- Anything?
- No idea.
It could be the battery.
It could be the starter.
We'll have to take
it apart to tell.
Like the car on the road.
Yeah.
The weirdness is startin'
to pile up around here.
Jackson, how's your pick-up
running these days?
I ordered parts to fix that
carburetor three months ago.
Maria's car?
She got the keys.
So knock yourselves out!
You stay here.
Hey! Hey, you got
to get me outta here!
Her car is dead too.
Oh, my god.
Hey! Get me out of here!
Inside the car is the safest
place you can be!
I'll grab Pritchard.
You go to the front door!
Come on.
Colt! No!
Get on your ass!
Right now!
You still insist there's no
greater hand in all this?
Where are your
first aid supplies?
In the drawer,
next to the fridge.
He moves, shoot him.
You got yourself hooked up
with a live one, huh, Colt?
So, what're you gonna do?
Shoot me?
That's how it's gonna go?
Like hell you will.
I need to walk for help.
The nearest farm is the homesteads.
It's 13 miles up the road.
He's right.
I don't recommend you go
for a hike
in the dark when
the storm's coming on.
I'm not staying here,
that's for damn sure.
Hey, it's not like they're
gonna let you leave.
They're more active at night.
I meant what I said before.
The sheriff will come
lookin' for us
when we don't check in.
Assuming he figures out
where we are.
I told you not
to check in, remember?
There's no telling how
widespread this storm is
or if anyone can even get to us.
Alright.
You're gonna need stitches, but
this should hold. How is it?
I could say I had worse,
but I'd be lying.
Did you see that out there?
You mean, the lightning that didn't
act like any other lightning
I'd ever seen before?
No, and that last strike,
I thought I saw something
right in the field where it hit.
- What? Ow, ow, ow, ow.
- I don't know.
Hey! Hey!
- It's Maria! It's gotta be!
- Where?
She's right there, right where the
lightning stroke in the field!
Hey, come on! Get these things off me!
Hurry up!
- I got to go!
- No, you can show me with the cuffs on.
Hey, deputy salter,
you stay here.
Hold on. Hold on
just in case.
Maria!
Maria! Maria! Oh, god!
Maria. It's alright.
Okay. Get this on her.
Where did she come from?
No! No!
Don't you touch her!
I'm just gonna
check her vitals. Okay?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Is she..
Yeah, she seems to be okay.
Could you get these cuffs off me so I
can bring my wife back in my house?
Please?
Come on, baby.
Get up.
- Do you, do you think you can do me one more favor?
- What?
When we get back inside, could
you go to my wife's closet
and pick out something
decent for her to wear?
I'd hate for her
to wake up wearing
something hideous
that I'd pick for her.
She'd kill me.
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey, wake up, Maria.
Jackson? Hey.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey. Hey.
Where's Jonah?
He's not here.
Oh, god.
Oh, god! Oh, god.
Oh, god!
They've got their hands
all over him.
I can't move.
I can't help him.
He's just a little boy.
Maria.
It's Colt salter.
Can you tell me where you were?
Who you were with?
Can't you see she needs a rest?
Why don't you just leave her be?
This is all your fault!
Our boy is gone 'cause of you!
He's gone!
Get away from me!
You said everything
would be alright!
You said you'd fix it,
but you couldn't!
You better make this right.
You get our boy back.
He's the only good thing
you ever did!
You'd fix it?
What does that mean?
- Who are you?
- She's an FBI agent.
She's gonna help us find Jonah.
Mrs. Pritchard, can you remember
anything that happened to you?
How Jonah was taken?
Taken?
Taken?
Why, Jackson gave our son
to those things.
- Didn't you, Jackson?
- Don't.
What things,
Mrs. Pritchard?
The angels his daddy used
to tell him about
before that crazy old man
took off his own head
with a shotgun.
- Angels?
- The ones he said watch over this house.
- Jackson actually called them down --
- Maria!
No. No!
Me and Jonah, we had plans
to go to my sister's
but my little man,
he got real sick.
- He was burnin' up --
- Fine!
You want to know?
You want to know everything?
I'll tell you everything.
You wouldn't pay for a doctor,
and now he's gonna die!
Quiet!
Lord of mercy, we turn to you in
this time of great need.
- Jackson, this isn't right --
- Quiet!
- Oh, my god!
- Keep your head down!
Jonah!
Maria?
Maria!
No! No!
You took one of those things?
Don't you understand?
They're not angels.
- They've got Jonah! You're a fool, Jackson!
- Maria!
- You're a fool!
- Hold on! Hold on!
Was that the first time you'd
ever seen one of those creatures?
Mr. Pritchard,
this isn't a game.
- Was that the first time
you had ever -- - no!
It was not the first time.
What?
Then when was?
Just after my daddy died.
Right before me
and Maria got married.
I saw a light out in the field.
And then, I was in the light.
It was, it was like water
bein' in water, only heavier.
And then all of a sudden, I,
I was someplace else.
I, I couldn't hardly see
but I knew
they were all around me..
...just looking at me..
...studying me like
I was some
kind of animal or
some thing.
Did they do anything to you?
I don't know.
I mean, I can't..
I don't remember.
Why you? Why here?
If we knew what
they were after..
What was that noise?
The cage.
You really did it.
It's one of them.
- What's it doing?
- It's calling 'em.
Be quiet!
Yeah, you call, but they
can't help you! Huh?
Not until my son is brought
back to me unharmed
you're gonna stay right there!
Do you understand me?
Huh?
Jackson, I don't know if
you want to be doing that.
Jackson, really.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Shh, shh, shh.
Earl?
They're inside.
I -- I need to get
the generator rolling.
Generator? Why?
The house is wired,
electrified on the outside.
That should keep
a couple from coming in.
You electrified our house?
Yeah, and the lights too.
That way we can at least
see the bastards.
The cars are dead.
What makes you think
the generator is gonna work?
Because it did before.
Come on! You got to get me
out of these now!
Now! Come on!
- I'll go with him.
- Okay.
There you go.
I'll stay with Maria.
Okay. Hand me my keys.
Fucking stuck.
Hey, Colt, you don't want to
go walking out there, okay?
Hey, come on. Back inside.
Come on. Back inside.
Who's there?
Deputy salter?
Pritchard!
Is that you?
Identify yourself.
What happened?
We heard shots!
I shot one one of them.
I -- I, at least,
I shot something.
I know I shot something,
but it's gone.
It's, it, it's just gone.
Is ours still in the cage?
Yes or no, is it in the cage?
- Yeah, yes, it is.
- Okay.
I can't imagine they're
gonna leave us alone now.
I'd like to retrieve my shotgun
from your car,
go look for my dog
if that's okay with you.
- Yeah, I, uh, we'll cover you.
- Come on.
Hey, Colt, wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
It's electrified now.
Remember that.
Earl!
Earl! Come on, boy!
Earl! Earl!
Jackson!
No. No.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Jesus.
I don't even want to know
what could do that.
They think they can do
whatever they want to a man
but they are not in charge!
They are not! They're gonna see!
They're gonna see!
Jackson!
Dial it back a notch.
We'll get through this.
You have my word.
Your word, Colt?
And you.
You explain all that?
You have no idea
what you are dealing with!
I'm sorry, I just get..
We're talking about
my family, you know?
I know.
Well, we can at least
be productive
while we're all
sitting around here.
Aside from the traps
you set, is the house
itself as secure as it can be?
That's a good idea.
Maria, take agent Francis
upstairs.
Check the windows,
throw furniture
anything you can against them.
Me and Colt,
we'll check the back.
Come on! Go!
Hey! Where do you think
you're going?
I'm getting my son back.
What the heck is that?
My daddy used to keep
fighting dogs down here.
He had to have a way to wrangle
the mutts without
getting himself bit.
What exactly are you
planning on doing to it?
I'm gonna show these sons
of bitches the concept of
you mess with mine,
I will mess with yours.
Whoa, hold on, hold on a second.
Now, I don't know
where this thing is from..
...but it is one of god's
creatures, regardless.
And it already looks,
it looks pretty sick.
And thine eye shall not pity
but life shall go for life
eye for eye, tooth for tooth
hand for hand, foot for foot.
Now, step aside, Colt,
or help me.
Yeah.
Now you herd him over to me
and I'm gonna hook him.
Hey..
Hit that side of the,
side of the cage.
Come on, son of a bitch!
Come on! Go!
Come on. Go! Move!
Colt! Get him!
Yeah, I got him!
I got him!
I got him!
Hey! Colt,
help me out with this!
Help me out! Come on!
Pull it! Pull it!
Argh!
What the hell is going on?
Stop!
Do you know how insane this is?
Maria came back where
that lightning struck.
There is something out there.
I intend to figure out
what it is.
You do want me to find my son
don't you, agent Francis?
Let him go!
Just let the man go.
Jackson, what're you doing?
This has got to be here.
It's here. It's got to be here.
I know.
I know it's here.
What's here?
Hey, Colt, give me your knife!
- Colt, give me your knife!
- Okay. Okay.
Here.
That pattern..
I've seen it before.
It's some kind of contact point.
It's not a contact point!
It's there goddamned front door!
Okay.
Okay, we better
reset your crossbow
and any other traps
you might have.
Nobody leaves
the house until dawn.
We know nothing
nothing about the psychology
of those things.
Hey, at least I did something!
At least, I fought back!
And who knows
how they'll retaliate.
Well, as long as it gets
my son back, I don't care.
Okay, you were right.
Those things are not animals,
they are more
they are much, much more.
And that disc out there
is obviously
some kind of a,
a teleportation, um
a gateway, an advanced
technology, right?
Look at this.
Your son drew this.
It's just like the design
on the disc out there.
It's like a, a -- a,
a mapping system
or a circuit diagram, a network!
Come on. It's..
Well, he clearly knew
about them.
Maybe that's why they're
so interested in him.
My son draws crazy shit
all the time! Look!
Huh? Look! Look!
Mr. Pritchard,
how did that thing
get out there
in the first place?
Are there any more of them?
How long has that thing
been out there?
Do you have any answers,
Mr. Pritchard?
Look at this.
It's your father, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Look really closely.
Look behind him.
He was working for 'em?
I think there's gotta be
more to it than that.
I'm no expert in agriculture
but that land out there
does not look very productive.
Yet your family held on to it
for generation after generation.
Why is that?
Tell them what he used
to say to you.
"Don't be like that idiot, Esau
"and sell your birthright
just 'cause
"you're a little hungry.
"Someday, we shall reap
god's harvest
"from this patch of earth.
It is promised to us."
He drummed that into me..
...without mercy.
He said that my
great-great-grandfather
was led here by the lord.
He said it in his own way.
I never thought..
I never dreamed that
it meant all this.
All of this.
Of course, my daddy
had his way out.
If we don't want
that to happen again
we need to get
to the bottom of this.
And the key to that
and to finding your son..
...is downstairs
in the basement.
It was obviously wearing
that for protection.
I wonder how long it
can survive without it.
If we're gonna have
any chance of trading it
for your son,
we need to make sure --
Well, this thing
can't fucking die
until I say it can.
Now come on! Get up!
Come on!
Come on!
They threw me away.
What?
They made this body..
And then they destroyed Jackson.
What does that even mean?
It means..
...my husband is dead.
I suspected that he was different
for a long time that..
That the man I fell in love with
isn't the one I married, but..
...those are crazy
thoughts, right?
Not so crazy now.
The worst part is
he had me believing
it was my fault.
It was you!
It was you all along
you goddamn monster!
What did he do?
What did he do?
I'll show you.
Go ahead, agent.
Have a look.
Oh, my god.
All those years
of shame of..
...of trying to hide it.
He wouldn't even let me
give them a proper burial.
He said that they were
abominations
before the lord.
They're replacing us.
You're saying Pritchard's
one of them?
I've had you over to my house
and you fooled us all!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
How is this possible?
How could you not know?
It wanted me to know
why I was here.
They gotta change..
...to adapt
to life here.
The new ones,
they can't be mules.
They gotta be able
to breed true.
You see, their world is dying.
They're just running out
of time to get it right.
What about Jonah?
Jonah's so important.
He's the first
natural-born.
He's the future.
- He's their future.
- What about our future, huh?
- Hey.
- What about our future?
Colt! Colt!
Back off!
I need you to go
upstairs right now
and make sure that
the house is secure.
Why?
If those things
wanna get in here
there's nothing
we can do about it.
You've seen what they can do.
It is not easy for them,
or they would have
done it already.
We just need to be able
to hang on until morning.
For what? For Jonah?
The kid is one of those things!
It's them.
They're coming.
Focus.
We need to hold it together.
There is every possibility
that Jonah is completely normal.
We don't have
all the evidence yet.
Evidence?
Who cares about evidence?
We're done.
Don't you see that?
We are at the little bighorn
and the Indians are circling
and they are gonna
do more than scalp us.
I just know that I can't
go out like that.
Then don't.
We have to hold the line here.
You and me.
There's nobody else
left to do it.
And nobody who would believe it.
To protect and serve.
To protect and serve.
Okay.
We're gonna get your son back.
It's time to negotiate.
Give them what they want
and we might all
get out of this alive.
You call this, this being alive?
I'm a goddamn lie. I don't
even know what the fuck I am!
Well you call it a soul
or whatever you like
but there is more
Jackson Pritchard
left inside there
than they counted on.
Maybe that was the case
with your father.
Maybe that's why
he took his own life.
They've been using us lab rats
my whole family,
for generations.
From where I stand, you're human
and you have been
fighting like hell
this whole time
to protect your family.
That counts for something.
Don't stop now.
Your son needs you.
You been listening
to anything I said?
My son is one of them!
We won't know for sure
until we get him back safe
and that is the only way.
Please.
If my Jackson is still
in there somewhere
the man I fell in love
with, I'm begging you.
Jonah is all that I got left.
Mr. Pritchard,
we need your help.
You have to decide. Colt
can't hold them off forever.
You know, this, this thing
is so sick and fragile.
I -- I want
to wrap it up.
Agent, give me that tarp.
It's right there on my
drill press right there.
Maria, come on
inside here, come here.
Come on! Hurry up, now.
Come on, put these on.
Put those on.
Come on over here.
Come on.
Agent!
- What are you doing?
- Not a word!
I'm gonna end this tonight.
You'll see.
Oh, my god.
Yes!
Jackson took it.
My babies
they're all gone.
I'm scared of what
he's gonna do.
I'll get Jonah back.
Colt.
I'm sorry.
Stop! Put down the gun, Mr.
Pritchard!
No! This ends here.
The bloodline ends here.
You can't be certain
that he's one of them.
I am certain!
Daddy! Daddy!
Daddy, daddy, please, please..
He's still your son,
Mr. Pritchard!
Whatever they've done to
you, whatever they've done
to your family, you,
you can't do this.
Please! Let go!
You're hurting me.
This is for the best, boy.
Don't make me shoot,
Mr. Pritchard.
Please.
God help us all.
Jonah! Get over here!
Drop it!
Come here, baby.
What're you gonna do now,
Mrs. Pritchard?
I'm gonna make sure nobody takes
my boy away from me again.
I don't want to take
him away from you.
You government types talk out
of both sides of your mouth!
You'll take him
and you'll lock him up
in a lab somewhere!
- Don't you even want to know what he is?
- No!
He's my son, and he's perfect!
I'm not gonna let you
destroy that.
Mommy!
Hush now, baby.
Oh, it's okay.
You're back with mama.
Nobody is gonna hurt you.
Sometimes god alone
just isn't enough.
You'll do whatever you have
to to protect your child.
You can't stop what's happening.
Just like you can't
stop a mother's love.
My boy is home.
That's all that matters.
So, Maria Pritchard
confirms a lot of
what's in your report..
About how she shot her husband
when he tried to kill the boy.
And I'm inclined
to believe the both of you
that it was
justifiable homicide.
You see what he did to
that house and, and Colt.
And the crater is
a manmade bomb left out there.
Not enough left of him
to fill a thimble.
What bomb?
And I never said
that he killed Colt.
Come on.
She also gives you
quite a bit of credit
for launching the assault
that got them free
from that lunatic.
What? No.
I didn't launch an assault
and he wasn't
holding them hostage.
Agent Francis, if you
insist on holding on
to this fairy tale
about men from Mars..
I never called them that.
It's gonna cost you your career.
And I shouldn't have to remind
you that in our line of work
we are limited to only
telling those stories
which we can actually prove.
Right? Now, I've laid out
the facts as I see them
as any rational person
could see them
and there's absolutely no
evidence to the contrary.
Well, did you check
the basement?
- There's nothing there.
- The cage.
There has to be DNA in there.
If you conduct a sweep --
I don't have the manpower or the
resources for that nonsense.
It's over.
The case is closed.
Pritchard was clearly a psycho.
Who became completely unhinged
in the last couple of days.
He had us all fooled.
Look at this place!
And I'm saying that your
initial suspicions
were right, by the way.
I don't care about being right.
We can't just sit back and
ignore the implications.
Is this normal to you,
the temperature dropping
30 degrees in five minutes?
Multiple lightning strikes
in the same place!
Listen to me.
You're gonna do
whatever you're gonna do
you've proven that..
But take my advice
and forget this alien invasion
taking over the world crap.
All you're gonna get
for your trouble
is a rubber room
and a lithium drip.
I know what I saw.
The local Indians
have been telling us
stories of spirits and demons
on this land for generations.
Yours wouldn't be the
first one, agent Francis.
You had it wrong, Colt.
It turns out we're the
Indians this time around.
What was that?
Just something
deputy salter said.
You know, my father
used to brag about being
1/16 Cherokee.
Do you think in 100 years
any of them will
be proud to be 1/16th us?
Take care of yourself now.
You too, sheriff.
And I really mean that.
There's no smoking
in here, ma'am.
Is death preferable to
knowing what I know now?
Maybe.
Maybe even worse is the prospect
of telling this story
over and over
knowing no one will
ever believe me.
Knowing it'll be
dismissed as easily
as the scribblings
of a child.
Jonah?
Those chickens aren't
gonna feed themselves.
Jonah?
Jonah!
Come on now, Jonah! Don't
play games with mama, now!
Jonah?
Jonah, what on earth
are you doing?
It's time, mama.
Time for what?
The harvest.
Oh, my god.
