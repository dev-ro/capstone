Guitar Wolf
A meteorite crashed into
the town of Asahi last night.
The exact size and location
of the meteorite are not yet known.
A full investigation is underway.
In case the meteorite has
landed in your backyard...
please don't use it
as a centerpiece or well-cover!
Send us a fax!
What a romantic subject!
I myself used to make wishes
on falling stars.
How sweet it was!
And now on to our next story,
at the zoo...

You gotta be a good girl,
understand?
Understand?
A good, good girl. Got it?
Next with a jet
Go, go, go
Uh huh, yeah.
Oh, and by the way...
could I get that new jacket?
Can I get it by Wednesday?
Yeah, yeah,
I got a party to go to the next day.
I'd really like it by then.
Shoes?
You okay?
Come on, stand up.
What? It's not like
you don't know Captain, right?
Let's go. Can't make
customers wait, can we?
Hey mister!
Do you know how to rock 'n' roll?
I'll do it today.
The only one who can outdo
Guitar Wolf is the one right here.
I'll go directly to
the manager of this club.
Yeah, great.
Well, talk to ya later.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Guess what this is?
Want it?
It's real gold, you know.
Bring me some milk.
Hello, hello, hello, my brothers!
Glad you made it.
Great show today, wasn't it?
Great!
You're gonna hang out
for a while, right?
This town's gotten pretty exciting
these days, hasn't it?
You fucking pervert!
It doesn't suit you, Guitar Wolf.
It really, really doesn't suit you.
Guitar Wolf, don't you remember?
You were only this big
when you first came here.
And what do you think he said?
Do you remember?
"Give me your boots."
He wanted my leather boots!
Well, you can't be a kid forever!
Rock 'n' roll is over, baby.
Do you understand
the word "business"?
If you understand,
then fuck off and get out!
What're you saying?
Rock 'n' roll is not over!
Rock 'n' roll never dies!
Somebody call an ambulance!
Take this.
Whistle when you're in danger.
Adios, amigo!
Rock 'n' roll!
Take this.
Whistle when you're in danger.
No fucking way!
You fucking weirdo!
Welcome to Asahi
Prevent juvenile delinquency
Protect sincerity
Have you seen
the people that work here?
- Maybe they went out.
- Maybe.
Let's get going.
Shit.
Coming all this way without thinking
it was definitely fucked up.
No fuckin' money either.
And now we're out here 'cause the bitch
wants to see a fuckin' meteorite.
What the fuck did you just say?
Nothin'.
Why don't you stop talkin' shit
for once in your life!
Somethin' wrong?
Whose fuckin' fault is it that
we don't have any money anyway?
Fuckin' nag me all the time...
What the fuck are you saying?
Why don't you actually try
makin' some money sometime...
instead of just talkin' about it?
I should fuckin' get paid just for goin'
out with a loudmouth bitch like you!
- What kind of a man are you?
- Man...
Why don't you ever do something,
anything, to make money? Be a man!
You probably fuckin' couldn't
make money if you tried!
I'll do somethin' about it, and I don't
wanna hear you cryin' about it later!
A gas station.
Stop! I'm thirsty.
Me too.
My ass hurts!
Masao.
- Come on!
- Masao.
Aren't you comin'?
Masao!
Don't push me, Masao!
Don't fucking move!
Move and I'll fucking kill you!
Give it up!
Hey, Masao,
what the fuck you sayin'?
Masao-chan,
we understand, okay?
Masao?
It's natural, but obesity can be
an indication of internal problems.
Whatever. What else?
Oh right. Can't forget to
talk about the meteorite.
Get the fucking car!!
- Okay!
- Okay!
- And now this breaking news.
- Turn off the radio.
A meteorite has crashed in the
town of Asahi.
So, about how much artillery
are we looking at this time?
Well, they asked me
if we were going to start a war.
I see.
About two hours...
We're a little later than we promised.
Well, it was
the boss' wedding, right?
I just really wish I could've
changed out of these clothes.
I'm sorry.
There wasn't enough time.
What should we do?
I don't fuckin' know!
- Let's go.
- Don't be fuckin' stupid!
If Masao gets popped,
we'll be busted too.
I don't fuckin' know!
Fucking Masao decides to go
and do this.
Oh, sorry.
Hurry!
Fucking drive!
Aren't you feeling well?
It's nothing to worry about.
Hangover?
What's going on?
Somebody just ran onto to the road.
It seemed a little strange,
in this place...
Nobody's there.
- You must've been hallucinating.
- What's that?
What the fuck was that?
Why don't you fuckin' talk to him?
Wasn't exactly safe for us either,
ya know.
Say that and Masao's gonna...
Masao!
What the fuck was with you pullin'
that kind of shit all of a sudden?
You scared the hell out of us!
Masao?
So, how much
did you manage to snag?
None.
None?
Stupid fuck!
He should've gotten somethin', right?
What's up with your nose?
Don't fucking cry!
Masao!
Give him tissues for fuckin' sake!
- Fuck you!
- Shit.
Masao? Masao?
Are you okay?
She's okay, right?
Well, we gotta get going.
You're the one who got him?
Thank you.
You must be very strong.
It's hot.
By the way, where do you think
everybody went anyways?
Not a soul in sight.
It's like saying,
"Come in and rob us, please!"
You know, after all that...
I think at least
I deserve some free gas, don't you?
So you're here by yourself?
Your Japanese is really good.
I'm here alone, you know.
My name's Ace.
Ace.
Ace. Understand?
- Ace?
- Yeah.
Ace is number one.
It means the number one man!
I'm off to see a show today.
Ah, it's gonna start soon.
Sorry, but I gotta go,
or I'll miss it!
By the way, what's your name?
Tobio.
Tobio?
Cute name!
It'd be nice to run into you again.
Thank you.
Get the fuck out of the way!
Out of the road!
I said out of the way!
Are you fucking deaf?
This ain't for nothing, you know.
What the hell are you doing?
That girl...
Ace!
Go, Ace!
You want her, don't you? Go!
Rock 'n' roll!
This is fucked.
Shit.
Masao, how do you work this?
I can't do it. Fuck this.
Damn it!
Don't fucking move!
Move and I'll fucking kill you!
Ouch.
Don't get shitty.
But ya know,
you were cool back there.
If that asshole on the bike
wouldn't've shown up...
we'd be kickin'
in a four star right now!
Pisses me off!
As if you fuckin' did anything!
Shut the fuck up!
Always runnin' your fuckin' mouth.
All 'cause you have to see
a fuckin' meteorite.
I'm not wasting my time talking to
an idiot like you in a place like this!
Hey! Where're are ya goin'?
To take a pee.
Wait up!
Hanako!
Don't follow me!
Don't get mad.
Hanako!
What?
Wait a minute, okay?
- Let's talk.
- Fuck off.
- Wait a fuckin' minute!
- What?
Look. When we get back,
I'll look for a job, okay?
Still talkin' the same old shit!
Why are you so fuckin' shitty?
Stop followin' me!
Don't be like that.
Was that Masao?
That fool's probably just
fuckin' around by himself.
- Come on, let's go back.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute!
What?
Kiss?
I'll kiss ya later.
Hanako!
There may be a meteorite there.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Hanako! Wait up!
Why do you care about Masao?
Masao?
Masao?
Isn't he fucking around
in the water over there?
Masao?
Masao-chan?
- Fuck!
- Masao?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Masao?
Hurry up, get in!
Go!
Fucking drive!
Hurry!
Go!
Tobio!
Ace, help me!
Tobio!
Let go of her!
This is crazy!
Let's get out of here!
Hurry! Run!
Hurry!
Stop!
Get away!
Tobio!
Wake up, Tobio!
It's okay! Tobio!
Let's go!
You gotta believe me!
Let's go.
Let's fall in love love love
Love love beam
So dear to my heart
Through all time
this song echoes
A kind smiling face
Completely wonderful, my darling
Send a notice to the far,
far distant future stars
Send a notice!
Let's fall in love love love
Love love beam
The power of love
Miracle beam
All the way to the sun
Is this song popular?
Yes, it's quite popular.
I see.
Let's fall in love love love
Love love beam
The power of love
Miracle beam
You have a nice voice.
I think you could become
very popular at this club.
Would you like to sing here?
Really?
Really and truly!
It's all up to you.
I would like it very much.
I'll show you around.
I've been listening to your song
for quite a while now.
"Love Love Beam," right?
Since when?
From a long long time ago.
It's a nice song.
First of all,
you need firm management.
And then... that dress...
We'll get you a new dress.
Have you eaten?
No, not yet.
- I see.
- But...
Get in.
One more thing.
I've got one more thing
to teach you.
Shit!
You ripped my fucking clothes!
My fucking clothes!
Fuck!
What?
We found them. They're playing
a gig in the next town.
Really?
- And where's the gig tonight?
- South off the highway.
That stinking motherfucker.
Do you want me to
come with you?
I'm going alone.
Roaring blood
Roaring blood
Alone at the intersection
in the middle of the night
What was that?
He took the girl with him.
- Forget him. Let's go.
- The signal changes, explosion on one!
Roaring blood
Roaring blood
Exploding blood
Roaring blood
Tonight, last night
and the night before
My memory is in the middle of a roar
Roaring blood
Roaring blood
Exploding blood
Roaring blood
What the fuck is this?
Baby baby baby
Roaring blood
Blood blood blood
Exploding blood
Walking down a street
Alcohol mixed through with my blood
Baby is the only one I notice
This is the only place I'll ever die!
Roaring blood
Roaring blood
Exploding blood
Roaring blood
Baby baby baby
Roaring blood
Blood blood blood
Exploding blood
Roaring blood
Roaring blood
Exploding blood
Roaring blood
Let's look for something
to block the door with.
An axe!
Ace!
Get it!
Please! Please!
Ace!
Shit!
It's no use.
We're gonna die.
Don't you dare give up!
I'm here with you, right?
Believe in me!
I'm telling you, we'll be alright.
Okay?
Sorry.
I didn't mean to do that.
Tobio...
Do you believe in God?
Up until now, I never believed.
But now, I believe I do.
To have met you in a situation like this,
that's definitely God's doing.
I believe in God.
At the end of the road...
At the end of the road,
you gotta be thankful.
But you know, I...
I'm not like Guitar Wolf.
I can't even save one girl.
I'm nothing.
I can't even play guitar.
I can't do anything right.
I'm so uncool.
Damn it!
Ace?
Tobio?
No way!
No fucking way!
Anything but that!
Ace!
Love has no borders,
nationalities or genders.
Do it!
But...
No way.
She's a guy?
I can't believe it.
Tobio?
Tobio!
Tobio? Tobio!
What's up?
It's Ace. Let's go!
Rock 'n' roll!
Ace...
Fuuuck!
Why'd she have to be a guy?
Why can't things go right?
Why is there shit like this?
What the fuck is going on?
There's no God here!
- A road!
- Help!
A car!
Stop!
Are you human?
Please help us!
The people in this town are... fucked!
Masao was killed!
Help us!
Everybody here is fuckin' whacked!
Eating people...
Have you seen Ace?
Are you listenin'?
If we don't get outta of here,
we'll all be fuckin' killed!
I know!
A guy in leather jacket!
We know! We know!
We saw him at the gas station!
Yeah! That guy on the bike!
We know!
Ride.
Really?
Oh, thank you! We're saved.
Huh?
What?
Hey, where the fuck're we goin'?
Where?
Asahi, where else?
I don't wanna die!
Don't you fuckin' get it?
Everybody there is fuckin' nuts!
- We'll all be fuckin' killed!
- Shut the fuck up!
Idiot.
Toshi, are you okay?
Let me go!
Hey, is the Guitar Wolf gig over?
It's over. Go home.
Do you know where they went?
How the fuck should I know?
What the fuck?
You really don't know
where they went?
Tell me.
They said they were
going to the next town.
That's all I know.
Really, that's all I know!
- Hey...
- What? Cut it out!
That scared shit out of me.
This is fucked up!
It was them! Those fuckers're probably
still round here somewhere.
Let's get the fuck outta here!
This is seriously fucked!
Uncool.
I bet he took his mama's comb.
You guys tell him!
This is seriously fucked!
Toshi!
What the fuck is your problem?
It's them.
They're fuckin' here!
Let's go!!
Hurry!
What's that?
I told you!
Toshi!
Fuck!
That scared the shit out of me.
What?
What the hell are you?
Guitar Wolf.
Fuckin' cool! What is all this?
Are these real?
In-fucking-credible!
No touching the goods!
What's with all this?
More importantly, let's figure out
a way out of this mess.
Yeah.
With all this shit, we can really kick
some ass and get the fuck outta here!
You're not touching any of this.
What?
You better not fuck with me!
No, you better not
fuck with me, asshole!
Stop! This is no time to
mess with each other!
And you Toshi,
don't be fuckin' stupid!
What are you doing?
We're going to help my
rock 'n' roll blood brother, Ace.
What are you talking about?
You don't even know
if you can help yourself.
Let alone anyone else!
Don't be stupid!
He's probably eaten by now anyway!
Yeah! There's no way
he could still be alive!
Let's get the fuck outta here.
You live here, right?
Don't you know why this is goin' on?
I have no idea.
I don't live here.
I just do business here.
Whatever. What are they anyway?
They look like zombies!
Zombies?
So they are zombies?
Zombies?
Like in Night of the Living Dead?
Yeah. Seen it?
Nope.
How about you?
- I don't watch movies like that.
- You?
Well, I've never actually seen it.
What do you mean you haven't seen it?
Fuckin' idiot!
What about you for fuck's sake?
No, I've never seen that fuckin' movie.
That's why I'm askin' you!
If I would've known this was gonna
happen, I would've watched it.
What is this? This is no time to be
discussing what movies you've seen!
But...
Why the fuck're those zombies here
in this town?
Who?
Expecting someone?
It's me, Kondo.
I came to get the stuff.
Are you really Kondo?
Hurry up and let me in.
It's not safe out here.
Me?
No, don't.
Really?
Toshi!
Until an official government
announcement is forthcoming...
please do not go outside.
At this point, all highways have been
closed by the National Guard.
All public transportation
including trains, subway lines...
and buses have been cancelled.
Numerous UFOs have been sighted
flying above cities all over the world.
Investigations are underway
at this time.
Until an official government
announcement is forthcoming...
please do not go outside.
Toshi!
Check this out!
Guess this is the end of humanity.
- Gross! There's no head.
- Disgusting!
Toshi!
Friend of yours?
It's the Yakuza I was supposed to be
doing business with today.
Really?
Zombie, definitely a zombie.
Fuck off!
Toshi, are you okay?
Hurry, we've got to
get him to the hospital!
This one'll become a zombie too!
Stop it!
He's not a zombie!
He's a person!
You're gonna shoot a person?
Toshi!
You guys have no other choice.
You're helping me get out of here.
Toshi, hang in there.
What are you doing?
What is this?
It's gold, isn't it?
It came from inside the zombie?
Ouch!
Now I understand!
I'm going to put an end
to all the zombies!
It's going to be so much fun!
- Hanako!
- Toshi!
He's turned into a zombie!
- Get out of the way!
- Stop!
Don't kill him!
Toshi.
Toshi!
Let's go!
I'm staying here.
We'll be back for you.
I thought so.
He bit you, didn't he?
What's so funny?
Something you'll never understand.
I'm not afraid to die.
Because I'll be with Toshi
even after death.
Playing tough, huh?
Look at yourself.
All you've got is a gun.
You'll never know real love.
I feel sorry for you.
Hanako.
Brain...
Hey, have you seen
three guys in leather jackets?
Guess not.
Guitar Wolf.
You know? You've seen them?
Don't know...
Which way?
That way...
That way...
Come here.
What the fuck's with you, weirdo?
Meat...
Ouch!
Motherfucker!!
Maybe I can use him as a shield.
Which way shall we go?
Let go, asshole!
Let go! Let go!
Stop!! Stop!!
No!
Fuuuck!
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Ace.
Let's go.
I didn't protect her.
I didn't even stay with her.
I didn't do anything.
You don't need this anymore.
Ace!
There are no boundaries
in rock 'n' roll!
Believe in rock 'n' roll!
Go!
Now where could they be?
Wherever could they be?
Look, friends for you!
Who's that weird fuck?
Friend of yours?
And why is he using that guy
as a shield? Isn't he a zombie?
I know you're up there!
Do something! Show yourself!
How dare you shoot your friend!
Don't you have a heart?
Give back the stuff
you stole from me!
That golden ball you've got?
It's worthless!!
I'll give you as many as you want!!
You double-crosser!
You fuckin' double-crosser!
Bye, bye, baby.
<b>ROCK'N'ROLL!!!!!!!</b>
Gotcha!
I finally found you!
What happened to this town anyway?
Say something!
Your dear childhood friend, Captain,
came all the way here to see you!
Don't hide.
Come out and play!
We used to play like this,
didn't we?
We could make a lot of money!
Let's be partners again!
You'll be great...
if you're with me!
Remember the past!
We were naughty then,
weren't we?
That leather jacket you stole...
I still have it!
Tobio!
This really does it for me!
Get out of my sight!
Tobio!
Tobio...
Hanako.
Toshi?
Toshi?
Hanako!
Toshi!
Sorry we're late.
Everything cool?
What the hell?
<b>ROCK'N'ROLL!!!!!!!</b>
Tobio.
I swear by my leather jacket
and by rock 'n' roll...
I swear...
I love you.
Use it.
From that day on,
I never saw a Guitar Wolf show again.
What happened on that night
I'm still not sure of.
Was it a dream or reality of what?
Courage and rock 'n'roll:
That's what he taught me
on that night.
Love has no boundaries,
nationalities or genders.
That's what he said.
And he was right.
And me, from now on,
I'll be with Tobio.
The two of us forever.
Guitar Wolf!
