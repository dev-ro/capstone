The late fourth century A.D. the Roman Empire began to crumble.
Alexandria, in the province of Egypt, still retained some of its lustre
possessing two of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world:
The legendary lighthouse, and the biggest library known.
The library was a not only cultural but a religious symbol
a place where the pagans worshiped their ancestral gods.
The traditional pagan worship in the city now coexisted
with the Jews, and an unstoppable religion up to now banned:
Christianity
Library of Alexandria, 391 A.D.
After taking the library, many pagans were converted.
Hipatia continued teaching and researching
while her former students held
important positions in the social elite.
The empire was split in two forever.
Many Christians saw this as a sign of the end of the world
and decided to prepare by practicing a more holy life.
The order of "Parabolanos" monks was charged to go
through the streets and watch for Christian morality
now uneven by the presence of the Jews.
The Library, years later.
The body of Hipatia was mutilated and the remains
were dragged through the streets and burned in a fire.
Orestes was outlawed forever and Cirilo
took control of the power in Alexandria.
Later, Cirilo was declared a Saint and Doctor of the Church.
Although none of Hipatia's works remain
it is known that she was an exceptional astronomer
well-known for the mathematical study of conical curves.
One thousand, two hundred years later
in the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler
described that one of those curves
the ellipse, governs the movement of the planets.
