- I've got this invitation
to go to Acapulco.
It's just too good to miss.
What do you want?
- Momma, you've
been to Acapulco.
How many times do you
wanna go to Acapulco?
- Till they stop
asking me, sweetheart.
- Who goes?
- It's me, Billy.
- Password.
- It's me, Colonel,
Billy Duncan.
I just wanna see Kathy.
- You get off of these premises.
- Come on, Colonel, I
only wanna see Kathy.
- What about?
- Colonel, that's private.
- That's private?
What is this stuff
you're pulling on me?
You're just like those guys,
those white collar guys,
down there at Cherry Point!
Everything is "hush, hush!"
Operation Sand Dust, hush, hush!
Everybody connected
with it, hush, hush!
Everybody except me.
Because I know something
they didn't know I knew.
Now you get away from that!
You bastards are all alike.
With your disguises
and your tricks
and your phony ides!
- Colonel,
if you'd just call Kathy.
- Now you leave
Kathy out of this!
You leave!
You leave!
You!
Operation Sand Dust.
- Grandpa?
- Operation Sand
Dust.
Operation.
- What that Billy?
- Sand Dust.
- Grandpa?
Grandpa, come on inside.
- Why do you keep
smoking that stuff for?
- Shit.
Don't cost nothing.
I take it from those kids.
- You keep smoking that,
you're gonna get us
thrown off the force.
- Hey.
That feels good.
- Ah, give me a puff.
Who was that?
- I think it's that Bill Duncan.
- Bill Duncan kid, huh?
Well let's go get him.
You idiot!
All right, force him over!
You never learn, do you, boy?
- Hey, can't you let
me go just this once?
I'm gonna blow my insurance.
I'm already paying double.
- That's all right, your
momma's got enough money.
By the way,
how's your momma these days?
- Nevermind.
Just give me the
ticket, Officer Ungar.
- Sign there, boy,
I'll make you a star.
- Do we get him again, Pete?
- No.
Too damn hot.
- You see who's out early
this morning, Froggy?
- I bet he ain't got
out reason, Chuck.
- No, he wouldn't like
that kind of party.
It's a little too rough for him.
I've been up all night
and I don't feel sleepy.
Froggy, you think our boy here
would like to give
us a little race?
- Billy, hell, he never races.
- Who the hell told you that?
I'll show you a race.
- All right, how
much handicap you want?
- Pow!
Pow, pow, pow!
Pow!
Pow, pow!
Pow!
Pow, pow!
Pow!
Pow, pow!
Pow!
Pow!
- What do I owe you?
- That'll be...
That's...
Sorry, I didn't hear you coming.
That'll be $11.15 with the oil.
Thank you, Mr. Craig.
- How far is it to
the nearest hotel?
- You stopping here?
- You don't like
this town, buddy?
- Oh, sure, sure.
Just a few blocks to the end
of town, there's a motel.
- Billy?
Billy?
God, I swear you're more
trouble than you're worth.
- Am I?
Am I?
- Well, if you don't look like
the cat that
swallowed the cream.
Where you been all morning?
Not waking people up at
the crack of dawn, I hope.
Oh, Billy.
Can't you be more ordinary?
- Yeah?
- Grandpa's so mad right now.
He says he's gonna
shoot you on sight
next time you set
foot on the property.
I do believe if you were
more ordinary right though,
you wouldn't be my
Billy, would you?
So peaceful here.
Wish it was always this way.
Just you and me and the sky.
Looks like a cup.
A giant blue cup.
- Yeah and we're the drags.
Pour it out.
- There's something so
dark in you sometimes.
It just sends shivers
up and down my spine.
- I love you, Kathy.
- Are you crazy?
You wanna be late?
- For what?
- For Franny's birthday party.
We're all due there about three.
- I don't wanna go to no party.
- Well, Mr. Billy Duncan,
if you don't wanna go,
I could always
accept an invitation
by a certain Chuck Boran.
- Over my dead body.
- What's this?
- I don't know.
Could be something
bit me when I was--
- When you was what?
- I was fooling around in
the desert this morning.
- You better put
something on that.
That looks pretty mean.
- You cut the first piece.
- Well, who wants cake?
- I do!
- Hey, get your
red-hot franks here.
Get your red-hot franks here.
Oh momma, wouldn't
Chuck like to give you
his red-hot frank right now.
- From what I hear,
Chucky, it ain't so hot.
- He's got an affidavit.
- You creep!
- Hi, Billy.
How about a swim?
- I admit it, I feel
kinda lazy right now.
- Hi, Fran.
- Hey, you want some cake?
I wonder why no
one wants any cake.
- I'll take a bite.
- Wanna bite?
- Yeah, I wanna bite.
- Some birthday.
Outside of you, Kathy, I don't
think anyone would've come
if it weren't for the pool.
- Don't be silly, Franny,
you've got lots of friends.
- Yeah, as long as I
don't run out of pools.
- I'm gonna go change.
Will you tell Billy
if he gets up?
In South Africa,
the leading spokesman
for the dissident army
said it would have nuclear
capability by 1979.
While France today
it's 28th atom bomb.
- They tell me cake is bad
for me, what about radiation?
- What about it?
You seen Kathy?
- She went inside
to get changed.
- They only saw a slow moving
pinpoint of light.
You couldn't hear
the darn thing--
- You seen Kathy?
- No, I haven't seen her.
- Get off of me, you stupid oaf!
- You might like it!
- Come on, you bastards!
- Billy don't!
- Froggy, the boy wants a fight.
- He wants to
get his head broken.
- Billy, don't.
Billy, don't.
Nothing happened.
Please, Billy, for me?
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone!
I'll kill you!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Billy.
Please don't be angry
with me, forgive me.
If only I hadn't interfered.
Billy, forgive me.
- Don't say that.
Don't ever say that.
- What?
- "Forgive me."
No need to forgive.
You were only trying to help.
- That's all I meant to
do, Billy, is help you.
- That's why I should be
asking you to forgive me.
For needing help.
- Oh, Billy, in some ways
you're the strongest
person I've ever met.
- Yeah, I bet you're the only
one in town who thinks that.
- Who else matters?
- Nobody.
Me and you.
Come on, let's get out of here.
- I had the most marvelous time.
- I'll bet.
- Hey, Froggy!
- Keep it down.
- Oh, Jesus!
That coulda killed me!
- That coulda killed all of us!
- We better get in the house!
- I'll call the police!
- Ungar, Jeep, you hear me?!
Damn.
- It beats me how
you can swallow down
a whole hot tamale first
thing in the morning.
You know what the lining of
your stomach must look like?
Give me a bite.
Jeep, Ungar, get in here!
Nice of you to show up.
I want you to run over
to the Walton place
and get a statement
from Franny Walton
about that car
blew up last night.
Think you can handle that?
- We got it.
- Thank you.
Liz, what're you
doing, typing a novel?
- Banging away as usual, sir.
- Come on in here.
What can I do for you, fella?
- First, you take
your feet of the desk.
Second, take the cigar
out of your mouth
and third, you stand up.
- And who the hell are you?
Excuse me, Mr. Craig,
I didn't know.
Why don't you sit down, sir?
- You can sit down now.
If I were to ask you if
anything unusual happened here
in the last 24 hours,
what would you say?
- I don't know, nothing much.
I did get this call
about a car blowing up
over at the old Walton place but
that's just kid stuff.
You know, a prank,
kids fooling around.
- I want a list of everyone
at the house when it happened
and I want the town sealed off.
- What do you mean, Mr. Craig?
- I mean, no news
flashes, no news leaks,
no news, period.
Unless I say otherwise.
Understood?
- Understood.
- You don't look so
bad today, Billy.
- I feel so good, I feel like
an idiot going to the doctor.
- What about the
lump on your chest?
My God, Billy, it's bigger.
- Yeah, it seems like.
- Well Dr. Mellon it is.
You know what Franny
told me this morning?
- She ate the whole
birthday cake.
- No.
Be serious.
Someone blew up Chuck's car.
- What?
Who would wanna do
a thing like that?
- What're you eating now?
- Lunch.
- Healthy girl.
- Boran!
- Hey, how long do
we have to stay here?
- Well, I guess
you gotta stay here
as long as the sheriff
says you have to, huh?
- You know, this is
like a flash, it came
down from the sky!
- Lightening?
- No, I know lightening
when I see it
and this wasn't lightening.
This was a solid circle
with color, then pow!
You know, just between us, I
think it was a flying saucer.
- Kid's nuts.
Seen Star Wars five times.
- Listen, I know
lightening when I see it
and this was something else!
- Can I get dressed
now, Dr. Mellon?
- Huh?
No, not yet.
Come in the other room.
Lie down, Billy.
Does that hurt?
- No, Doc.
- That?
- No.
- Do you feel that?
- No.
- Quite frankly,
Billy, I must
confess, I am puzzled.
That is quite close
to the surface
and what I would like to
do is try to remove it,
if that's all right with you.
- Sure, Doc, whatever you think.
- Okay.
Now what I'm gonna do
is give you a local
to anesthetize the
area, it won't hurt.
Now you be careful that doesn't
get infected, all right?
- You okay, Billy?
- Sure, Doc patched
me up just fine.
- Oh, by the way, give me
a call in a couple of days
because I gotta run the specimen
over to Springfield
myself tonight
and I'll have the answer
in about 12 hours.
- Thanks, Doc.
- Yes, thank you.
- Would you mind cleaning
up the examining room?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Yeah, Mike?
Oh, thank God I caught
you at lunch, huh?
- I'm surprised you noticed
something like lunch time.
How are you, Doc,
long time no see.
- Oh, it's too long.
Listen, Mike, I want
you to do me a favor.
- Sure, Doc, shoot.
- I would like to bring a
specimen over tonight and...
No, after hours.
I'm afraid it'll
be around midnight.
Would you wait?
- It's that important?
- It could be.
I'll get there as soon as I can
but I am afraid it
will be after midnight.
Thank you.
All right, goodbye.
- What're you
doing here so late?
- I'm calibrating my
enter thermometer.
- Peggy, would you look up
some numbers for me, please?
First see if Dr.
Mellon's at home.
And if he's not, try
the Sheriff's office.
Might have been an accident.
- May just have ourselves
a mad bomber, here.
What do you think?
- We should call the
lab in Springfield.
Tell them we found what's
left of Dr. Mellon.
- Go ahead, you two.
- I want a list of everybody
that's seen the doctor
in the last 24 hours.
- You don't think somebody
that lives here did this.
- Let's get down
to work, Sheriff.
We're running out of time.
- Billy, Billy, Billy.
You're getting to be a real
Dillinger, ain't you, boy?
Somebody calling
for you every place.
Where you think you're going?
I know where you're going.
Get in.
See, that dude from Washington,
he wants to ask
you some questions.
He's asking all
kinds of questions.
See, he's from that new school.
And that ain't the
way he get answers.
Now, if he's from
the old school,
my school!
Right in the belly, Billy.
That's how you get answers.
- Right in the belly, Billy.
That's good, Pete.
- What do you
know about Chuck's car
being blown up?
- All I know is what I heard
when Kathy picked
me up this morning.
- Where'd you go?
- To Dr. Mellon's.
I had this sore on my chest
and Kathy thought I should
let the doctor look at it.
I don't like going
to doctors but.
- Do you mind showing us?
- Of course not.
- Good God.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Thanks for coming in.
- You need a ride back, Billy?
- No thanks, sir.
I can make it.
- Everything seen and heard
in this room stays here.
Understood?
- Understood?
- Absolutely.
I ain't never seen
nothing like that.
What was it?
- That's just what
I'm gonna go find out.
- Well, I've given
it every test I know.
It's the oddest thing.
- The oddest thing, what?
- Material is nothing that
comes out of this earth.
There was some
traces of burnt flesh
but the mass of it is inorganic.
- You sure of that?
- Absolutely.
And I'll tell you something else
if you wanna think I'm crazy.
Whatever it is is growing.
- You're not crazy.
Have you found
anything to destroy it?
Thanks, Mike.
Emergency alert one.
- What now?!
- I could use a Coke!
- Give me some, man.
I gotta use the john.
- How different it
all looks, Billy.
Billy, you asleep?
- No.
Of course not.
I heard every word you said.
- Oh, then what did I say then?
- "How different it
all looks, Billy."
- You're provoking,
you know that?
You're absolutely,
positively provoking.
- Well,
Tony Craig.
- It's been awhile, Colonel.
- A couple wars, I'd say.
Well, come in, come in.
- Not bad.
- It's mediocre.
Figured for a bigger finish.
- Maybe General?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, they offered me
an early retirement.
I accepted.
Hobson's choice.
Oh, sit down, sit down,
make yourself comfortable.
- I'm afraid there's
no time for that.
- Well, what's your problem?
Have a drink?
- 22 to dispatch.
- Boy, this has gotta be
the best buggy in town.
I can't wait until everyone
sees us driving around in this.
You know, I can't believe
them insurance guys
actually believed that stupid
story about lightening.
- Shut up, Froggy.
- Sure, Chuck, sure.
You know, I can't believe
them Springfield dudes
would actually believe that
story about lightening.
I mean, you gotta be
stupid to actually--
- Froggy, shut up!
- Sure, Chuck, sure.
It couldn't be raining.
- Where?
- In town, I thought
I saw lightening.
- Would you knock it off
with that lightening crap?!
- He's supposed to be a hot one.
Let's go get him.
- Now we can get him!
I got him!
That son of a bitch is still up!
- Won't be long now.
Hey, Chuck, who's the creep?
- Hey, creep, want a lift?
Let's give the bum a real treat.
A ride he'll never forget.
- Here, drink some of this,
it'll help your nerves.
Billy must be somewhere close.
- Billy!
- Was Billy in that car?
Come on, let's go.
- Hop in, brother.
There I was, 30 thousand
feet straight up.
Feeling frozen yo-yos
and the string broke.
I didn't falter.
Just kept on going, man.
I knew Nevada was straight
around the corner.
I turn the corner, ran
smack into Betty Crocker.
She was running across
the sky yelling,
"You never outgrow
your need for milk."
So I looked at her
and I said, "Baby,
"you're something else."
Far out, man, you
know what I mean?
What you doing?
Hunting?
What you get out here?
There ain't nothing but
rattle snakes and turtles.
Far out!
