[kitten purring softly]
This is the first one that I started
when I was 13.
[chuckles softly] And it says,
"My life, my career, my... my dream...
[whispers dramatically]...my reality."
[chuckles]
For a while, I wrote with quill and ink.
That was a phase I went through.
Like, I had a glass quill
with, like, an ink jet.
[pages rustling]
You know, my entire moral code,
as a kid and now,
is a need to be thought of as good.
That's dangerous. That's not...
That's dangerous for you.
It was all I wrote about.
It was all I wanted.
It was the complete and total...
belief system
that I subscribed to as a kid.
Do the right thing.
Do the good thing.
And obviously,
I'm not a perfect person by any stretch,
but overall, the main thing
that I always tried to be was...
um...
like, just...
like, a good girl.
[crowd clamoring]
[announcer] And now,
to perform the national anthem,
a multitalented performing artist
from Reading, Pennsylvania.
Please welcome Taylor Swift!
- [crowd cheers]
- [teenage Taylor] Hey, everybody.
- Um...
- [man] Hi, Taylor.
- [all chuckle]
- You know,
one of my first memories of country music
was when I was six years old,
and my parents took me
to see LeAnn Rimes in concert.
[young Taylor] Guitar!
[breathing heavily] I... am...
happy!
[announcer]
...twelve-year-old Taylor Swift!
[woman] Whoo!
- Hey, everybody. I'm Taylor.
- [crowd clapping]
[Taylor] I'd been trained to be happy
when you get a lot of praise.
[woman] Hi, Taylor.
See, that's...
that's Sony Music, right there.
Sony is gonna listen to her CD today.
[chuckles]
[Taylor] I had that praise of, "Taylor,
you're doing a good job at your work."
Hey, this is Taylor Swift, and thanks
for listening to Cat Country 98.1.
[Taylor] "You're doing a good job
at being a songwriter.
You're doing a good job
at being a musician."
Like, those pats on the head
were all I lived for.
No one's going to be watching this
'cause it's my home video, but...
right here, look at that.
Look at that. Sixty...
[chuckling]...60
on the Billboard charts right there.
[audience cheering]
[fans screaming]
[crowd cheers]
[crowd roars]
[Taylor] I was so fulfilled by approval...
that...
that was it.

who everyone wanted me to be.

going into putting new music out.
If I don't beat
everything I've done prior,
it'll be deemed as, like,
a colossal failure.
Maybe first I could talk to you
about, um, kind of new album stuff.
There's gonna be from...
from 16 to 20 songs on it...
is what I'm guessing
it's gonna end up at.

One of the best videos of all time!

because Kanye West was on the stage.
And then I, um...
then I wasn't so excited anymore.

You know, I just... I don't know him,
and I don't wanna start anything
'cause I just, you know,
I had a great night tonight.
Everyone is talking
about this Kanye West thing, aren't they?
In case you're lucky enough
to have missed it,
Kanye West interrupted a young singer
named Taylor Swift while she...
President Obama
calling Kanye West a "jackass."
I can name you ten or 15 people
that he wouldn't have gone up
and taken that mic away from.
But he did it with a 17-year-old girl
because he could.

yeah, there's a part of me

definitely not ready to have kids,
definitely not ready

[Taylor] She's... Okay, so what you're...
what you're seeing here... is...
[stammers]

when both of her kids were out
of the house.
She decided to get a third child,
like, a human-sized dog.
[Andrea] She's actually my cancer dog.
After I... found that out, I...
I decided to, um...
to do something I'd always wanted to do,
which was...
get a-a really big dog.
- That's good, Mom.
- Yeah. Well, that's what it is.
I'm happy that worked out for you.
I'm sor... sorry you had cancer.
[chuckling] I'm sorry.
That's really what it is.
[Taylor] She got cancer several years ago.
That has been really hard for me
- because she's my favorite person.
- [both speaking indistinctly]
On the third song,
where I hadn't gotten it started yet,
she goes, "Come on, Mom."
Like, into the microphone.
[both laughing and chatting indistinctly]
[Taylor] It woke me up from this...
this life where I used to sweat
all these things.
- [Taylor] Hi, Dad.
- How you doing, babe?
[Taylor] But, like, do you really care

You gotta be able to really prioritize

This is looking good, right now.
Would you like a glass of red wine
or white wine?
Can I get some white wine?
Oh, you got the red wine?
- Does that make me a difficult guest?
- [Taylor] It's for the recipe.
I'm happy to switch.
It's too adult for me,
- let's be honest.
- [Abigail] Yeah.
- [chuckles] Oh.

And... ah, yes.
Okay, that's dinner.

[Taylor] I'm gonna get some ice

[Abigail] Yeah.
Oh, that's fine.
That's honestly just what I wanted.
- Yeah.
- [chuckles] You're like... "Uh..."
[Taylor] Eh.
- You know, Claire just had a baby.
- [Abigail] Mm-hmm.
And, like, I went over to see her, and...
[Abigail] How's she doing...
- She was just...
- ...with motherhood?
[chuckling]
Well, she's the best 'cause she's like,
- "Just so you know, this is what it is.

- You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep.
- [Abigail] Yeah.
- You feed 'em, change 'em, they sleep.
- [Abigail] You do it all over. Yeah.
- You feed 'em." Like...
- [Abigail] It's just...
She's... And I was like,
"So, it's like a Tamagotchi?"
- [Abigail laughs] Oh, my God.
- [chuckles] Like...
- Like, exactly, so...
- [Taylor] Yeah.
- [Abigail] You'd be an excellent mother.
- [chuckles] Thanks.
[Abigail] No questions.

[fan 2] Taylor!
[fan 3] I love you!
Well...
- So, this is my front yard...
- [seat belt clicks]
...and...
I'm highly aware of the fact that
that is not normal.
I've learned over the years...
[gulps]...it's not good for me
to see pictures of myself every day
'cause I have a tendency,
and it's only happened...
a few times,
and I'm not in any way proud of it,
but I get...
I tend to get triggered by something,
whether it's a picture of me
where I feel like I looked like my tummy
was too big
or... or, like, someone said
that I looked pregnant or something,
and that'll just trigger me to just...
s-starve a little bit, just stop eating.
I thought that I was just, like,
supposed to feel like I was gonna pass out
at the end of a show
or in the middle of it.
I thought that was how it was,
and now I realize:
no, if you eat food, have energy,
get stronger,
you can do all these shows
and not feel it.
Which is... [sighs]
...a really good revelation...
because I'm a lot happier with who I am,
and I'm happier with, like...
I don't...
I don't care as much if, like...
somebody points out
that I have gained weight.
It's just something
that makes my life better,
the fact that I'm, you know...
I'm a size six
instead of a size double zero.
I mean, that... that wasn't...
how my body was supposed to be.
I just didn't really...
understand that a-at the time.
I really don't think I knew it.
[crowd cheers]
[Taylor] I would've defended it to anyone
who said, "I'm concerned about you."
I was like, "What are you talking about?
Of course I eat.
It's perfectly normal.
I just exercise a lot."
And I did exercise a lot,
but I wasn't eating.
And...
you can't... [sighs]
I just...
I don't think you know you're doing that
when you're doing it gradually.

[Taylor]
There's always some standard of beauty
that you're not meeting.
'Cause if you're thin enough
then you don't have that ass
that everybody wants.
But if you have enough weight on you
to have an ass,
then your stomach isn't flat enough.
It's all just...
fucking impossible. [scoffs]
You don't ever say to yourself,
"Look, I've got an eating disorder,"
but you know you're, like,
making a list of everything you put
in your mouth that day,
and you know that's probably not right,
but then again, there's so many diet blogs
that tell you that that...
that that's what you should do.
This would cause me to go into, like,
a real shame...
like, hate spiral.
This.
And, like, I caught myself yesterday
starting to do it, and I was like,
"Nope, we don't do that anymore.
We do not do that anymore,
because it's better to look...
to think you look fat
than to look sick.
And we don't do that anymore,
and you just...
We're just...
We're changing the channel in our brain,
and we're not...
we're not doin' that anymore.
That didn't end us up in a good place."

Taylor Swift could not take herself
more seriously.
I think
that there's plenty of annoying women.
I-I think that Taylor Swift,
she is annoying.
[Nikki Glaser] She's too good.
She's too skinny. It bothers me.
All of her model friends.
And it's just like, come on!
[man 1] Lock and load, boys.
[man 2] Yo, Taylor!
You fucked him, Taylor?
[presenter] We've got a roundup
of the guys that Miss Swifty has

She's going through guys like a train.
- Can we get a pan down?
- [reporter 1] It's beautiful.
[reporter 2] I wanted to show the legs,
'cause as I was telling you,
you're gonna walk home with more
than maybe just a trophy tonight.
I think lots of men.
I'm not gonna walk home
with any men tonight.

We give you the latest
can't-look-away twist
in one of America's
favorite celebrity feuds.
[reporter 3] Kanye West
recently dissed Taylor
in his new song, "Famous."
The song contains a lyric
calling Taylor Swift the b-word.
[Kanye] ♪ I feel like me and Taylor
Might still have sex ♪
♪ Why? I made that bitch famous ♪
Kanye had said all along
that he got permission. Taylor denied it.
[reporter 4] Kim Kardashian released video
of Kanye West
secretly recording his conversation.
[Kanye] I mean, thanks for being,
like, so cool about it.
- [Taylor on speakerphone] Oh, thanks.
- [Kanye] Yeah.
[Taylor] Um, yeah, I really appreciate it.
Like, the heads-up is so nice.
She posted on Instagram,
"Where in the video is Kanye telling me
he was gonna call me 'that...
- biatch' in his song?"
- [Joy Behar] Yeah.
[reporter 5] Swift writing,
"I would very much like to be excluded
from this narrative,
one that I have never asked
to be a part of, since 2009."
I don't buy the story
that she was so insulted by that one line.
I think she saw an opportunity
to be victimized here,
and she thought
everybody was gonna get on her side.

[Taylor] When people decided I was...
wicked and evil and conniving
and not... a good person,
that was the one
that I couldn't really bounce back from
'cause my whole life was centered
around it.
#TaylorSwiftIsOverParty
was the number one trend
on Twitter worldwide.
Know how many people have to be tweeting
that they hate you for that to happen?
We're people who got
into this line of work
because we wanted people to like us,
'cause we were intrinsically insecure,
because we liked the sound
of people clapping
'cause it made us forget how much
we feel like we're not good enough.
And I've been doing this for 15 years,
and it's just, I'm tired of it.
[voice breaking] I'm just tired of the...
[inhales sharply]...just...
[sniffles]
[crying]...it just feels like it's
more than music now at this point.
And, just, most days, I'm like, "Okay."
But then sometimes, I'm just like...
[breathes shakily, whimpers]
...it just gets loud sometimes.
[Taylor]
When people fall out of love with you,
there's nothing you can do
to make them change their mind.
They just don't love you anymore.
I just wanted to disappear.
Nobody physically saw me for a year.
And that was what I thought they wanted.

- Yeah.

theater,
dance sequences,

it's like, dancers, cats,
gay pride,
people in country western boots.

- everything that makes me me.

[Brendon chuckles] This is so cool.
- [Taylor] Uh, should I just follow you?
- [assistant] Yes.
[jet engines whirring]
[Taylor] Just a curious cat in a...
in a big world.
I really, really care about my home state,
and I know that in this...
at this point in time, like,
my home state is a huge,
hugely important part
of this midterm election.
[newscaster 1] Tennessee's US senate race
figures to be crucial
in both parties' efforts to try
to control the US Senate after this year.
[newscaster 2] Marsha Blackburn,
a self-described hard-core conservative,
proclaims her support
for President Trump often.
I know the left calls me "a wingnut"
or "a knuckle-dragging conservative."
And you know what? I say,
"That's all right. Bring it on."
[Taylor] One of the things that, like,
outraged me so much
is that she voted
against the reauthorization
of the Violence Against Women Act,
which tries to protect women
from stalking,
from date rape, from domestic violence.
And then, obviously,
it's a no for gay marriage,
it's a no
for them to have any rights whatsoever.
I think I'll be really upset...
if people think that Tennessee...
stands for those things.
[interviewer] You've been very secretive
about how you vote,
what you're voting for.
Well, I mean,
I just figure, I'm a 22-year-old singer,
and, you know, I don't know
if people really want to hear
my political views.
I think they kind of just want
to hear me sing songs
- about breakups and feelings.
- [audience laughs]
[Taylor] Part of the fabric
of being a country artist
is, "Don't force your politics on people.
Let people live their lives."
That is grilled into us.
These three women have been
the reigning queens
of pop and country music.
They're the biggest-selling female artists
of all time,
nearly 30 million records sold
and even more fans
who always used to love
their high-spirited style,
their music, and their moxie.
Well, that racy magazine cover
on the stands today
pretty much sums up
some of the names
the Dixie Chicks are being called
in America these days:
"traitors, the Dixie Sluts,
anti-American,"
all because of one split-second comment
aimed at President Bush
right before the war with Iraq.
[audience cheers]
Their opinion is so ignorant.
They don't know
what they're talking about.
[commentator]
I think they are the Ditzy Twits.
These are the dumbest, dumbest bimbos,
with due respect, I have seen.
These are callow, foolish women
who deserve to be slapped around.
Absolutely.
[Taylor] Throughout my whole career,
label executives
and publishers would just say,
"Don't be like the Dixie Chicks."
- And... I loved the Dixie Chicks.
- [crowd cheering and whistling]
[Taylor] But a nice girl doesn't force
their opinions on people.
A nice girl smiles and waves
and says thank you.
A nice girl doesn't make people feel
uncomfortable with her views.
It's my right to vote,
but it's not my right
to tell other people what to do.
- Right there, sister.
- Yes, thank you.
- Come on. Come on. Come on!
- All right.
I was so obsessed
with not getting in trouble,
that I was like,
"I'm just not gonna do anything
that anyone could say anything about."
I'm just getting... I'm just...
I'm getting to the point where I can't...
listen to people telling me,
"No, stay out of it.
Stay out of it."

[reporter 1] Taylor Swift the singer,
she goes to court today
against a former radio DJ
she says once groped her.
[reporter 2] Swift says this picture
shows the moment
Mueller inappropriately grabbed her,
putting his hand up her skirt.
[Taylor] This had happened to me.
We told his boss.
They did an investigation.
He got fired,
then he sued me for millions of dollars,
so I countersued for one dollar.
You walk into a courtroom,
and then there's this person
sitting in a swivel chair,
staring at you
like you did something to him.
The first thing they say to you in court
is, "Why didn't you scream?
Why didn't you react quicker?
Why didn't you stand
further away from him?"
Then he has a lawyer get up
and just lie.
There were seven people
who saw him do this,
and we had a photo of it happening.
And I was so angry.
I was angry that I had to be there.
I was angry that this happens to women.
I was angry that people are paid
to antagonize victims.
I was angry
that all the details had been twisted.
You don't feel a sense of any victory
when you win...
because the process is so dehumanizing.
This is with seven witnesses and a photo.
What happens when you get raped,
and it's your word against his?
- [crowd cheering]
- [piano playing]
So, um, I just wanted to... [sighs]
Just kind of looking back, um...
this exact day a year ago, um...
[crowd roaring]
...I was, uh...
I was not playing a sold-out stadium
in Tampa,
I was... I was in a courtroom
in Denver, Colorado, um...
[sighs]
Honestly, I-I was there
for a sexual assault case,
and...
t-this day, a year ago,
was the day that, um...
[voice breaking]...uh, the day
that the jury decided in my favor
and said that they believed me.
[crowd cheers]
I guess I just think about all the people
that weren't believed,
people who haven't been believed,
or the people who are afraid to s-speak up
because they think they won't be believed.
And...
And I just...
I just wanted to say that, um...
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
to anyone who ever wasn't believed
because I don't know h... what turn

if people didn't believe me
when I said
that something had happened to me.

- [Andrea crying] I'm so proud of you...
- Thanks, Mom.
...for taking this shitbag of shit
they gave you.
- And you made it into this.
- Oh, my God.
[Andrea] I'm really proud of you.
- [sniffles]
- It's okay now.
[Andrea pats Taylor] I'm good.
[Taylor] I-I just...
I couldn't really stop thinking about it.
And I just thought to myself,
"Next time there is any opportunity
to change anything,
you had better know what you stand for
and what you wanna say."
[news fanfare plays]
We are less than three weeks out
until the midterms,
and Tennessee's senate candidate
Marsha Blackburn is up in the polls.
Congratulations, I know you've got
a little momentum going.
This is the third poll in a row
that has shown you in the lead.
[jet engines whirring]
[Taylor] My team's really not happy
with me right now.
All I've talked about for the last couple
of months is the election in Tennessee.
It's not that I want to step into this.
I just...
I can't not at this point. Like...
something is different in my life,
completely and unchangeably different
since the sexual assault trial last year.
Like, and no... no man in my organization
or in my family
will ever understand what that was like.
[man 1] For 12 years,
we've not got involved
with politics or religion.
Yeah, but this is on the home front.
And also,
back in the presidential election,
I was in such a horrendous place
that I wasn't gonna pop my head
out of the sand for anything.
[Scott] Why would you?
I mean, does Bob Hope do it?
Did Bing Crosby do it?
- Does... Does Mick Jagger do it?
- [Andrea] Honey, what the hell? Come on!
- [Scott] What I'm saying is...
- Bob Hope and Bing Crosby?
First of all,
these aren't your dad's celebrities,
and these aren't your dad's Republicans.
[man 1] Imagine if we came to you
and said, "Hey, we've got this idea
that we could halve the number of people
that come to your next tour."
[man 2] The other thing,
just from a security standpoint,
"Taylor Swift comes out against Trump."
I don't care if they write that!
I'm sad that I didn't two years ago,
but I can't change that.
I'm saying right now
that this is something
that I know is right,
and, you guys,
I need to be on the right side of history.
And if he doesn't win...
- [stammering]...then at least I tried.
- [man 2] Taylor, here's the problem.
I just want to read you what I wrote,
and I'm gonna try to start...
I just want you to know
that this is important to me. This is...
- [Scott] I totally agree with the issue,
- Have...
- but let me explain to you...
- Have you heard her?
[Scott] I've read the entire thing,
and the bottom line right now:
I'm terrified.
I'm the guy that went out
and bought armored cars.
I worry for her safety
as much as anybody does.
Maybe more.
[voice breaking]
It really is a big deal to me.
She votes against...
against fair pay for women,
she votes against
the reauthorization of the...
of the Violence Against Women Act,
which is just basically protecting us
from domestic abuse
and stalking. Stalking!
She votes... She thinks that...
that if you're a gay couple
or even if you look like a gay couple,
you should be allowed to be kicked out
of a restaurant.
It's really basic human rights,
and it's right and wrong at this point,
and I can't see another commercial...
and see her disguising these policies
behind the words
"Tennessee Christian values."
Those aren't Tennessee Christian values.
I live in Tennessee. I am a Christian.
That's not what we stand for.
I need to do this. I need you to just...
Dad, I just need you to forgive me
for doing it, 'cause I'm doing it.
- Okay, so...
- I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little nervous.
- You should be.
- [woman chuckles] Ooh.
- I want to do this.
- Okay, so... [sighs]
I always have to bring up everything
that could go sideways...
- everything we need to expect.
- Yeah.
- One: the president could come after you.
- Fuck that, I don't care.
If I get bad press for saying,
"Don't put a homophobic racist in office,"
then I get bad press for that.
- I really don't care.
- I would stand behind that 1,000 times.
- Me too.
- Yeah.
I think that it is so frilly
and spineless of me
to stand onstage and go,
"Happy Pride Month, you guys,"
and then not say this...
when someone's literally coming
for their neck.
[quietly] Yeah.
- [Andrea] All right, cheers.
- Cheers, ladies.
- [Andrea] God help us all.
- Cheers to the resistance.
[chuckles] To the resist... Stop it.
[softly] It's gonna be okay.
[Taylor takes a deep breath]
Oh...
Oh, my God.
Oh, it's so scary. This is the picture.
- One...
- [Taylor and Andrea]...two, three...
- ...go.
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- [Tree] Oh, my goodness.
[Taylor and Tree murmur nervously]
[Tree inhales sharply]
Taylor Swift broke her silence
on politics over the weekend,
publicly backing two Democrats
in Tennessee.
Taylor Swift is taking
her first political stand,
backing Democrat Phil Bredesen.
The superstar making it clear
to her 112 million followers on Instagram,
and the world, where she stands.
[reporter] Taylor Swift's jumping
into politics. What do you say?
Let's say that I like Taylor's music
about 25% less now, okay?
[reporter 1] The 28-year-old pop star
made her statement on Instagram.
[reporter 2] She broke
her longstanding policy
of not talking politics...
[reporter 3]
...using her voice in a new way.
[reporter 4] This is so out of the norm
for Taylor Swift, who...
[reporter 5]
Republicans for years have thought
that Taylor Swift
was a crypto-conservative, and she just...
[reporter 6]
It is a risky move for an entertainer
to step into politics at her age,
- at her stage in her career.
- [reporter 7] Vote.org reporting
more registrations in the last day
since Taylor's post than in all of August.
According to vote.org on Monday,
nationwide there have been
51,308 new registrations
- in the past 24 hours.
- [Andrea] Whoa!
Yeah!
[group exclaims]
- [man] So proud of you.
- [Tree] Congratulations.
- [Taylor] Thank you.
- Go, Taylor.
Do you think it'll... Do you think...
[woman] I think it could, definitely.
It's your first race, so...
I really hope it actually,
actually does something.
But you know what?
Donald Trump likes my music 25% less.
[all laugh]
I feel 200 pounds lighter.
I just feel like a... I just feel...
I've been feeling this way for months.
[Tree] Perez Hilton just posted,
"Note how Republicans are attacking
Taylor Swift's intelligence
instead of her ideas.
They don't respect women enough
to debate them."
[man] Wow.
It's not not true.
[Tree and man laugh]
- You look gorgeous.
- [Taylor] Thank you.
- Stunning and sexy.
- I look like a melted-down disco ball.
[assistants chuckle]
- [assistant 1] I love it.
- [assistant 2]My God, you look amazing.
- [Taylor] I am...
- Oh my God.
- [assistant 3] Gorgeous.
- ...a Pop-Tart wrapper.
[Andrea laughs]
- [assistant 5] Try this on that ear.
- [woman] She's got that...
You know what?
This is gonna sound ridiculous,
- but I can't move past here.
- Ooh, you got it.
- [group laughs]
- You got it.
[groaning and exhaling slowly]
That's how this dress makes me feel.
- [assistant 3] Oh.
- [assistant 5] Hmm?
[assistant 1] Can you breathe?
- I can brea... I can.
- [assistant 1] Yeah.
- Is it easy? No.
- [assistant 1] The other one's better.
[indistinct chatter]
[bright instrumental music playing]
[excited chatter]
[man] Don't block her.
- [photographer 1] Taylor! Taylor!
- [photographer 2] Taylor!
- [photographers shouting indistinctly]
- [camera shutters clicking]
To your right! On your right!
[photographer 3]
Taylor, look over to your right!
[Taylor] Thank you for this.
And I just wanted to make a mention
of the fact
that this award
and every single award given out tonight
were voted on by the people.
And you know what else is voted on
by the people...
[audience cheers]
...is the midterm elections
on November 6th.
Get out and vote. I love you.
[audience continues cheering]
[metronome playing beat]
[choreographer 1] Pre-chorus.
Six, seven, eight.
[choreographer 2] One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four five,
six, seven, eight. Three!
Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[choreographer 1] Chorus.
Six, seven, eight.
- [metronome stops]
- [indistinct chatter]
Yeah, I need to work on my face.
I look like I have a mean face sometimes
when I'm not trying to.
Know what I mean?
Um...
I think you might be more sensitive
than me to that.
- [chuckles]
- Yeah, I have a really slappable face.
- Slappable? Ouch!
- Yeah, you just want to be like...
"What are you plotting?
What's she planning?"
I'm not meaning to look like that.
You looked confident and strong.
It's the chorus.
- [laughs]
- You got it. All right, we'll...
I'm gonna try to be more likable
on the next one.
All right, all right. Perfect.
[chuckles]
[choreographer 2] One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight. One...
[Taylor] I wish I didn't feel like
there's a better version of me out there.
I feel that way all the time.
You know what we call this?
This is "last rhino of the stampede,"
up here, just... [groans]
Everybody else is runnin'. Limping.
First to get eaten.
I keep looking down
because I'm afraid.
Afrai...? [chuckles]
And it shows.
[Taylor] It's a lot to process
because we do exist in this society
where women in entertainment
are discarded in an elephant graveyard
- by the time they're 35.
- [choreographer 2 clapping]
Two, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
- Three!
- [crowd cheering]
[Taylor] Everyone's a shiny, new toy
for, like, two years.
[crowd exclaims]
[meditative chanting music playing]
[Taylor] The female artists that I know of
have reinvented themselves 20 times more
than the male artists.
They have to...
or else you're out of a job.
Constantly having to reinvent,
constantly finding new facets of yourself
that people find to be shiny.
- [crowd cheers]
- [Taylor] Be new to us, be young to us,
but only in a new way
and only in the way we want.
And reinvent yourself,
but only in a way
that we find to be equally comforting
but also a challenge for you.
Live out a narrative
that we find to be interesting enough
to entertain us,
but not so crazy
that it makes us uncomfortable.
This is probably one
of my last opportunities as an artist
to grasp onto that kind of success.
So...
I don't know, like,
as I'm reaching 30, I'm like...
"I want to work really hard...
um...
while society is still tolerating me
being successful."
[chuckles softly]
[reporter] We have another result
from the Senate. Marsha Blackburn...
we were just talking about that...
Marsha Blackburn will win the Senate seat.
The Bredesen camp was very much hoping
for the "Swift lift," as they called it,
because young voter turnout spiked here
by sevenfold
from the previous midterm election,
and yet that wasn't enough.
[meditative piano music playing]
I guess Tay Tay didn't have
that much sway-sway.
[audience laughs]
I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
I can't believe that she gets to be
the first female senator in Tennessee
and she's... she's Trump in a wig.
She represents no female interests.
She won by being a female applying
to the kind of female
males want us to be
in a horrendous... 1950s world.
So, for the next two years,
we have to build on what started here.
[sighs]
The first verse I want to be all about,
like, hearing the news.
You know, if you were, like,
a kid who, like, loved Beto
and thought that was the future
of Texas,
or you really thought Stacey Abrams
was gonna win
and you went door-to-door,
trying to make it happen,
and then she still gets beat...
- [Joel] It didn't happen.
- And it didn't happen.
But it's like, statistically,
you know, we have, what?
Three to four million people turning 18
in the next two years before the next one?
So, it's like...
it's basically saying, like,
"Don't lose hope. Don't get..."
[Joel] Yeah, your time will come
if you just hang in there.
- Yeah.
- [Joel] Yeah.

off of my mouth...
like, forever. [laughs]
[Jonathan Van Ness] You were really major
at midterms, honey.
[Taylor] Thank you.
If you have anything I can help with,
just let me know.
I think we just need to,
like, really keep talking about it
because we really do need people
to put the pressure on those senators
to pass the Equality Act.
If they are forced to vote on it
and they do vote against it publicly,
then it's really...
then we have their numbers,
you know, for next year.
[indistinct chatter]
[Taylor] Literally,
just call me for anything,
'cause you do so many good things
for people.
[Jonathan laughs]

[Taylor] I want to love glitter
and also stand up

that exist in our society.
I want to wear pink
and tell you how I feel about politics.
And I don't think that those things
have to cancel each other out.

About a year.

that I really like having cute nails,
but I really can't go in public.

I will die if I get a VMA.
Well, if we win something,
you're definitely first on the list.
I will lose my shit.
- You don't understand.
- [laughs]
[Todrick] This is one of my favorite manis
I've ever gotten.
I appreciate it.
Give me a good review on Yelp.
[Todrick] I will.
- Swift Nails is the place to go.
- Yeah.
- It looks so good.
- Fuck, yeah.
And the VMA goes to...
Taylor Swift, "You Need to Calm Down."
[group exclaims]
At the end of this video,
there was a petition,
and there still is a petition...
- [Jonathan] Whoo!
- [audience cheers]
...for the Equality Act,
which basically just says
we all deserve equal rights
under the law.
[clicks tongue] And...
I want to thank everyone
who signed that petition
because it now has
half a million signatures, which...

...which is five times the amount
that it would need to warrant a response
from the White House.
