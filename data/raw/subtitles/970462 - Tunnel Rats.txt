Cu Chi region,
Vietnam
The tunnel is cleared.
Come on, move.
Move.
We got to get
quickly to the camp.
Let's go.
I got a letter from my mother.
Well, guys, move along, we have
all day.
Welcome home. There will be a palace,
but not bad.
This is the roof we have. Garraty,
How you doing?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Garraty. No
give food that bites.
Look for a bed, unpacking
their things.
Hey, welcome, welcome.
Damn clowns pile.
Gentlemen, the shower is at 17 hours.
That's my bed.
The illustrious Lt. Hollowborn.
Sir?
Men, this is Lieutenant Hollowborn.
I do not care what they did before.
In this section does not smoke drugs.
Instálense, Bathe and rest a little.
We're going into the first
tunnel tomorrow.
If you have a problem, talk to the
Sgt Heaney.
"The first tunnel tomorrow! Magnificent.
Three months on a ship and now
for a hole.
This is mine.
- What's your name, friend?
- Miller.
It is too early to kick butt
in this war.
Hello, you're in my bunk.
- Yes, you want change?
- No.
Damn.
If you look in the Bible, in the Battle
Jericho, the Lord commanded Joshua ...
kill all the men, children,
women, cattle and slaves of your enemy
So you win a fucking war.
Would you like putting up the prisoner?
In this cursed killed five
my men. I want to be hanged.
I understand that, Lieutenant, but still
is a soldier.
No soldier, not wear uniforms. Want to
be hanged.
Yes, sir.
So be it.
Men, to form.
You will witness the execution.
Come on.
Men,
this man is a murderer Vietcong.
He murdered at least five of
our brothers.
We will not have mercy.
We will not have prisoners.
It's crazy.
- Insane.
- Garraty, turn it down.
From where I come to this we
call it murder.
You got a problem with the army or
me, you idiot?
- Why would a problem
with you, sir? "Well.
- Are the new?
- Yes
How long have you been here?
Time.
- Have you heard about the tunnels?
- Yes
- Have you been in any?
- In a few.
Well, welcome to the camp.
- Porterson.
- Johnson.
Thank you.
Johnson, does not it?
Miller, I Miller. And you are ...
- Porterson.
- Porterson, yes.
Well, I'm not used to this
food.
Mom is a very good cook.
Their cookies are delicious.
Every Friday night we have
A lovely dinner of rest day ..
she and I and the entire neighborhood.
I can not wait to return.
She's sick, my mom.
Every day that passes me away, its
heart melts more and more.
If I lose before they can return ...
- Garry, right?
- Yes
Miller.
People like Miller has nothing
to do here.
- I know.
- He talks a lot. Nothing you said ...
served here.
- If you talk a lot here, hurt sales ...
or do other people die.
Look at them, for example. They
an appearance and leave.
And there are others who think
this is a fucking game.
And there are guys like Miller, who fall into
combat.
Those who speak much, is because
are shitty of fear for being here.
I hope this helps you
feel better.
Want to play God,
son of a bitch? Is it what you want?
It is neither God nor the Devil,
Harris, but of survival, you idiot.
Well.
A child may kill only
the mere fact of being here.
It will not matter if you are
a good guy.
The same crap.
Wrong.
Come here.
- Sergeant?
- What happens to food?
It tastes bad, Sgt.
I know. Where are you?
- Michigan.
- Yes?
The parents of my wife has a home
in Charlow, you know where that is?
- Yes Really?
- It's near the lake. It's beautiful.
Sergeant, can I ask you a question?
Yes
Were you afraid there?
Let me tell you all you need to know:
Here's all about survival.
There is neither black nor white, everything is gray.
The sooner you understand that, more
chances are of ...
pack your things one day, beat it
and brag enough about the war.
- You understand?
- Yes
Finished eating.
Little Horn
- Want to play?
- I'm going to three.
Since I beat you twice.
- I think it's time for you to retire.
- Show me your queen.
- Well, here we go. Is the queen, no?
- Yes.
- It's a beautiful black queen, did you see?
- Yes
Well, boy, ready?
Just think of the beautiful
black queen.
- Where?
- There it is.
- You sure?
- Completely.
Well done, kid. Look at her.
You are cheating, kid.
- Stop corrupt new.
- Nobody is corrupting anyone.
Trying to learn something,
Is not it?
- Damn thing.
- We are getting fatter ass.
- Come on, we concentrate six.
- Six?
Yes, go.
- Are you ready?
- Ready.
Well, let's see what you got.
- What?
- That there.
- You sure?
- Completely.
Oh, oh.
You see, boy? Again, you can.
- Damn.
- All right.
- Will you win?
- Best spare me your cigarettes, Terrence.
Is there no sin in that?
"To the Romans, Chapter 11.
"To the Romans, Chapter 11,
Did you hear that?
Go to "Jeremiah 29:11"
Oh, really?
What do you think it is,
Chicago street?
- Chicago.
- What the hell do you know about the Bible?
You'll see, I'm about to show you.
"For I know the plans I have
toward you, saith the Lord, ...
thoughts of peace and not of evil, to
give you an expected end "
- "Then I invocaréis ...
- "Then I invocaréis, y. ..
I will listen and gather you from all
nations and of all places ...
where I have driven.
That's right.
- What the hell does that mean?
- Tell what it means, Harris.
It means that if you have faith, God
save all this rot.
- Do you have faith?
- Yes
So God save you all this
rot, eh?
- I think.
- That's good, because I think ...
while other men are risking their
life patrolling the area, it's good ...
hear that Harris will be saved.
- This is not the end, man.
- This is the end.
- Nobody is trying to take your hair.
- Stop that.
- That book itself is good.
- There he goes.
- Yes, this book makes people ...
believe he was going to leave here
as if by magic.
Get out of here, what do you think?
- Get lost.
- Hey, do not touch me!
Got a problem?
What's up, black?
Who you think you are!
Get out of here.
Come on, boy.
Put the money on the table.
Show me a queen.
- Ready?
- Ready.
What rot, to hell with them.
- What is your ... Gil ...
- Graybridge.
A yes.
What's wrong, Graybridge?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think
in God?
Do I believe in God? Let me ask you
a question to you:
When was the last time the Sox
Rojas won the series?
I dunno, 50 or 70 years ago, I think.
Does that answer your question? I'll tell
one thing ...
There has never been better franchise.
My name is Isaiah
- You, you're the franchise.
- What did you smoke?
No, listen, listen. You like
hamburgers, is not it?
- Everyone likes it.
- Everyone likes ...
but in California a guy started
business. The magic words:
burger, chips, milkshake, speed,
You know what I mean?
Just had to find a piece
dirt, jump-start a business y. ..
that easy. It's the American dream
that's what I mean.
What American dream, Graybridge?
Does this seems the American dream!
I do not think any dream.
I misread.
I mean when I return.
I will be my own boss, I will
businessman, I a. ..
Okay, Graybridge, me too.
I'll get a girl, I will
buy a boat, a house near ...
of a lake. Gonna be great.
But meanwhile, this is all
what we have.
And there's a whole forest full of
bastards with slit eyes ...
which have their own dream,
whatever.
And we will cut his throat
to get it.
I misread, I'm talking
the choice of burger ...
- Yes, yes.
- That you speak, is the way to the future
That's fine. Give me a little
water.
Sure.
The damn water.
What the hell, man!
- I asked for water.
- Thank you, very good for you.
This is important, boy, so
pay attention.
A man is measured by how
holding the cigar.
- With the right?
- Yes
Pull your shoulders.
Look ahead. Inhale.
- You okay?
- Shit.
Morning in the tunnel, if I were you,
would not smoke.
What the VC give a damn
if I smoke or not?
Underground in an enclosed,
the Vietcong could smell ...
anything, your shaving lotion,
cigarette smoke in uniform, ...
may even know the brand
you smoked and if that happens, ...
you're dead.
- Lie, Johnson, lie.
"Are you kidding me?
Can you discover if I do this?
Then worry about your mom when
received the bad news.
My parents have a house on Lake
Michigan.
At night my sister and I
scurried up the beach ...
we went to bed in the sand and we
stayed there looking at the stars.
We talked about everything. She spoke of
girl stuff and I ball.
We spent hours there.
I remember once ...
we fell asleep there y. ..
I woke up when my dog
licked my face.
I'd give anything, to see
my family now.
My sister, my dog, my parents.
What about your parents?
Must have been very difficult for you
with your mom and dad?
You do not know a damn thing about my mom
and my dad.
Sorry.
Well, enough of stupid questions.
- Stop nagging.
- Sorry.
No shit like that matters: where
've been, where are you.
Now you're in Vietnam.
What matters is what you do
in the field.
Oh, my girl's kiss.
Well, now I do.
- What's that kissing, Graybridge?
- We came up with my girlfriend and me:
The satellite of love. Throws a kiss into
up every night y. ..
she receives from the Moon.
- Nice.
- Yes
Let me ask you a question, what
Hollowborn there with you and today?
We had a collision.
- Were you able to say something?
- Not much.
Maybe next time
you stay silent.
Hero. John Wayne.
Thank you for the honor.
Would you eat here?
Yes
- Looks good.
- Yes, thanks.
I've heard of those tunnels.
An uncle died there last year.
Your uncle was clearly not an M-60.
He said they have miles long.
No one knows where they start or
where they end.
It is a bad place to be.
- Porterson, you ready?
- I was born ready.
- Are you nervous?
- Nothing. Follow me.
- At your service.
- "At your service".
Yes you're funny.
Well, idiot, walk.
Green Cape, at the head.
Garraty, in front of me. Johnson,
you close the fly. Come on.
I do not lose sight.
Let's go.
Careful.
- Heaney?
- Yes, sir.
- Calls on the perimeter.
- Litford, Green, give me the perimeter.
We found this tunnel
yesterday before putting the Sun
No one enters the tunnels at night.
Well, let's see what it is.
At the opening there is a knife.
Looks like a trap.
At least we saw it in time.
Volunteers.
- Here I am.
- I go first.
- Garraty, Johnson, Porterson.
- I have a large penis, but ...
tremendous balls.
Harris, stick with the gun.
Idiot.
- Hey, Garraty.
- Yes?
- Five dollars for a dead Vietcong.
- Deal.
What the hell!
- Shit, what the hell was that!
- I got it.
Care.
Already out of there.
Porterson, need help?
Damn I need another pad.
Crap. Do not worry, partner,
I'm with you.
Resist. Garraty, look at me.
Here I am.
You'll pull through. Resist.
Garraty, look at me.
- Porterson, give grenades.
- Here's grenades.
Blow it. Blow it and get out of there.
Come on.
Come on.
- Come on.
- Get out.
How many dresses there Vietcong
down, Johnson?
I saw two, Lieutenant.
Well, throw tear gas down there.
Harris, I will take Garraty of
back to camp.
- Heaney.
- Yes?
Stay and meet all the intelligence
they can.
Dan and Bob come to me.
Let me radio.
Pick him up.
- Porterson, ready?
- Ready.
We have something, not Vietcong.
Come out.
We got it.
Leg.
We have another.
There is another.
We got it.
Lidfort, give me a knife and a
flashlight.
- Let's go back down.
- Take this.
Here you go.
- Careful.
- I will.
There is nothing down here.
We will attack this position.
If we die, we die with honor.
Well, I explore this tunnel.
- You brings up the rear.
- I'm behind you.
Johnson, Johnson.
Alpha Brother, go ahead. Change.
- It's loose. Damn.
- Shit.
Harris, Lidfort, stay here
if they return.
Green, Summer, come with me, come on
review.
Yes, sir.
Holy God.
Oh, God.
- We must get back to Harris.
- And Porterson?
I will not stop here.
We return to find him. Now we
to return.
Are not you worried about Porterson?
What the hell, man! Where
hell are the others?
- Johnson is dead
- What do you mean he's dead?
What the fuck you think you want
say he's dead?
- Has a bloody hole in his neck ...!
- Who the fuck you think you're talking about?!
- ... in the eyes!
- You have to get
We get the idea, Green
- And what about Porterson?
- We did not see
What now?
Harris tries to connect
with Lieutenant radio

Lord, we must divide
Porterson down here somewhere
Otherwise someone else will find
We need to separate
We will be
together. And make silence
Why are you so?
