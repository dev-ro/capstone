'No animals or birds were harmed

'All characters and incidents in this movie

'In this movie, though some scenes

'...some important characters
been shown as speaking in Tamil'
Women's boxing is recent in
India, but...
...we're already hosting
the world championship
It's a historic event and I'm proud
to be in-charge
That is very big responsibility
I wake up early, finish all work,
wait for my husband to leave...
...travel 20 miles furtively to see you
and you treat me like shit!
Quit nagging
You're not my wife
Run along
Like how your wife
ran away with that boxer?
Mr Prabhu, how's it working under
Mr Dev Khatri again...
...post the notorious standoff in 1996?
Ma'am, that's old news
He apologized
and I accepted
Let it go
Why are there very few champions
in a population of a billion?
We won a bronze last year and...
Kill the politics in boxing and
you'll find a champion every street
Mr Prabhu, you're known
to be temperamental
 How's it handling girls?
Am I running a brothel?
How dare he speaks
to a lady like this?
What kind of daft shit is,
'handling girls'?
Keep the footwork light
Bloody elephant
That's a foul!
Give me the speed with which you
chomp free mutton
Block her punches
Stop
Get into the ring Mr Know-it-all
Sorry
Now move it
Block...block...block
Red is the winner
She's no boxer at all
Stop gloating
Lose that flab first
You've no ringside discipline
Quiet!
The Association's gone to the dogs
thanks to your 'quiet'
Speak up man!
Sir, you're wanted
by the committee
Urgent meeting, sir
The students have
complained against you
A sexual harassment complaint
Get to the point
We've started an enquiry committee and
till the report's out, you're suspended
What crap!
- How dare you come with a beer?
- Why do you meet when I'm drinking?
Don't waste my time
Our girls are feeling unsafe
Married women come to your flat
What's it to you
what I do in my home?
My wife ran away 'cos I was
a failure due to your politics...
...now I'll sleep with anyone
Your wife, his wife, prostitutes
But I never touch my students
I don't select boxers
in a bedroom like you
I select them in the ring
This should be against you
Four screwballs heading a committee!
Shut up!
This is committee meeting
Behave yourself!
You can't take action based on
an anonymous letter
Okay, forget suspension, but I'm
answerable to my superiors
- We'll transfer him to Chennai
- To Chennai?
Nonsense!
What will he do there?
There are no boxers or facilities
He is a no 1 Coach
He boasts of creating
champions from nothing
Let him create one there
I should've castrated you in 1996
and saved women's boxing
Send me to Chennai or Timabktoo
I'll create a champion and show you!
'THE FINAL ROUND'
"Scorching anger, blazing heart"
"My gaze turns asunder
the many obstacles in my path"
"Dreaded visage, boiling blood,
A furnace with a blazing pace"
"I'm not a slave to fall at your feet
Self-respect's my strength"
"I don't need to hide in fear,
my heart's laid bare"
"No way can you stop me
No handcuff can bridle me"
"Get the hell out of my way
Go on buggers 'Cos I fear none"
 "Raging ire
Fuels the fire"
" My veins coil
to form a wheel"
"Daring heart would me to go"
"My pace would topple the sun"
"Road-wheel would take up a fight"
"But would buckle to my might"
"No way can you stop me
No handcuff can bridle me"
"Get the hell out of my way
Go on buggers 'Cos I fear no one"
"Am a toughie,
no trouble scares me"
"Am ready to tread on rough roads"
"Fright is not in my dictionary"
"Think of nothing but boxing"
"Walkers don't dare
Am a flyer"
"No way can you stop me
No handcuff can bridle me"
"Get the hell out of my way
Go on buggers 'Cos I fear no one"
I spend shit-loads to welcome him
and the bugger doesn't come!
Prabhu sir, welcome
You're late
We put up quite a show
The girls expected you
Senior 'Coch'? Boxing 'Loin'?
What's this crap?
That's how we do it! Birth, death,
weddings, honeymoon...
...attaining puberty
everything gets a banner!
We are our person
Won't I do this much for you?
- Punch Pandian Junior coach
- And you'll always remain a junior coach
At least you're on time for the zonals
Come, I'll introduce my champs!
Sir, my girls!
Gayatri, come here
Come
Gayatri's boxing for five years
Slept with Coach Innocent to get here
Abirami, Melody Jaya are all useless
Shakti's here only for a railways job
Nobody's serious about boxing
No spark in them
So use your spark
to ignite them!
Chill, sir
Stop criticising my girls
They are good fighters
Just feed them and watch!
Like Tsunami
I'll introduce my star, Luxmi
Lux's here just for a police job
No spark, just soap suds in this 'Lux'
Move
Move
Go slow
Quiet!
What the hell are you doing?
Quiet!
Madhi, watch out
Idiots, you're late
Why late?
Hurry up
Are you happy
with the facilities?
Next round boxer come to the ring
Don't you remember me?
I'm Innocent
Why are you quiet?
Do you have any problem?
- Do you know a lawyer?
- Of course sir
- Why?
- I want to file a case
Against whom?
Against your pop,
for producing you
Having your tummy
like a punching bag, get lost
Luxmi, red
Vijaya, blue
First round
Box
Break her ribs
Just do
Punch her
Soooperb, my dear
That's it
Hurry! Madhi sister got the victory
'No one opposite
Lux is the best'
Results about # 2
Winning on the points,
blue is the winner
Blue?
Referee, you slope
to them for money?
Grandpa, what's happening?
I should've won
- You don't worry
- Referee, what's this sir?
You are not supposed to do like this
as no one dares questioning you
Sir, they've cheated
Please go ask them
Aren't you the new coachie?
Stop faffing and ask them
When the opponent's dad's an official
A knockout works...
...not pussyfooting
Come on sir,
Lux fought well!
Go and ask them, sir
Bullshit! The ring
isn't for pansies
These are only fit to wash clothes
You dog...Damn cheat
I'll kill you!
I'll break your teeth
You curly hair
Get this blow
Are you supporting him?
If you give mixed results
I'll kill you
Take your hands off me
Madhi! Listen to me
Don't do like mad
Let's go
Listen to me, Madhi!
I'll be nice
Promise
What do know about boxing?
How dare you cheat us?
- Leave me
- Madhi, let him go
Is this how you cheat the poor?
Please use your
power and help
Why should I help?
I wash my ass not others
Junior! Where can I get a drink?
Sir, are you divorced?
Nope
She dumped me!
Terrible
I feel bad for you
Did I cry to you?
A married man has one wife
A bachelor has many wives!
You're a dude!
My wife and boxing
were my world
I never looked at another woman
Not like now
She wanted me to win the '96
Olympic gold so bad
I won the selections easily...
...but my bloody coach
Dev played dirty...
...and sent another
boxer instead of me
I missed the Olympic gold medal
And My wife ran away with another boxer
Your story's so sad
Women are-
Hey, who's boxing?
Stinky drunk, get home!
Hey Pandi
Who was boxing there?
Wretch Madhi
She's the devil
who thrashed the judges
She'll kill you too
Buy fish, sir...fish...fish
Iyer's favourite, Mackerel fish
Film director Sankar's favourite, Red snapper
Today special
Come on
Fish
Fish
Is the fish fresh?
Don't squeeze it
like it's your wife
I'll chop you up
Piss off!
Girls are only fit to
'wash clothes' huh?
I'll punch you so bad, you won't have
a mouth to smoke with!
Hey move man
- Where did you learn boxing?
- Why?
Where did you learn boxing?
Bugger off
You can't seduce me
with corny lines
Get out
Where did you learn boxing?
Stop repeating yourself,
senile old goat
The foul mouthed devil
sells stolen fish
Come here
Go, Miss World is calling you
What a perfect couple!
Sister
Sister! Come and
buy some fish
My dead fish will die seeing
your ugly mug! Beat it!
Here it
Now tell me
Where did you learn boxing?
Okay, but one condition
What?
First shove it up your ass
Sister...Sister
Sister
Come to the gym
Two hours, morning
and evening
I'll teach you boxing and pay you
500 bucks per day
Old man! Muhammad Ali taught me!
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee
Make sure you bathe
You stink!
Lux! Look!
Look it
You sold all the fish!
The crazy coachie promised
500 per day if I go to him
Bastard
- I'll kill him
- Idiot! He called me to train
Pandian says he's a womaniser
Did you agree?
He's no George Clooney that
I'd fall for him!
Imagine, 500 bucks everyday!
We'll get poor mom
a new saree...
...Nike shoes for you and
eat chicken curry finally!
Bugger, give it back!
Respect your father
Look at Lux
She's like me, peaceful
This one's like you
A barking orangutan!
Return it Samikannu
I'm not Samikannu anymore
I'll box your ears
Now my name's Samuel!
Samu
What Samuel?
Did you convert for money?
Oh God!
Jesus, forgive these sinners
Damayanti, you're Diana from today!
Honor the Father and the Mother
Amen!
Madhi's Madonna from today!
Mom, leave him
Devils! My mom told me not
to marry a north Indian!
I am not listen that
Hey devils
"She dances to the flutter
of the 500 notes"
"To a rhythm of the fish
bubbling in the curry"
"Hell bent on fulfilling
every dream"
"The little queen reaches
for the pinnacle"
"She'll grab everything
she can"
"And not a soul
dare stop her"
"Come boss come"
"She'll get the better
of you every time"
"Like a match stick
that'll burn you each time"
"Come boss come"
"Their daily struggles rise
and ebb with the tide"
"But she rides life with smiles"
"Astride like a queen she reigns"
"Come boss come"
"She'll get the better
of you every time"
"Like a match stick
that'll burn you each time"
"Come boss come"
"Yov, what do you think?"
"Come boss come"
"She'll get the better
of you every time"
"Like a match stick that'll
burn you each time"
"Come boss come"
How the door has been opened?
Thieves again?
Who's up there?
Just a tad late!
He said the girls are useless
What's got into him now?
What time is it?
I got late
I'm asking you why?
I just got late
You're mine for the two hours
You'll obey me
You'll call me 'Master'
even in your dreams
If you break a rule, I'll kill you
What?
Can I pee or
do you dictate that too?
Warm up!
Nice comedy
One maniac's gonna train the other!
Knock out for boxing
Hey, move man
50 done! Next?
- Where are your shoes?
- A moment master
Lux! Give me your shoes
I'll return it to you
after the training
Quick
Go out
- How many punches are there in boxing?
- I know all that!
Come here
Stay away! I've been learning since
I was 4 years...
...from the Muhammad Ali
I've seen all his fights
What did you learn?
Lots! Just keep punching
till your opponent's out!
Jab, cross, hook, upper cut
Only four punches
- I just didn't know the names
- Oh? So show me
Use the body's full power to punch
Don't you dare come close
Get it straight! I'm not
interested in your body
You're not getting it
even if you crawl
- Hey, Santhosh
- Master
Finish her off
Show me your technique
Hey Muhammad Ali's disciple
It's not a street fight
Come one...get up
UP!
Use your head
Get it?
- Go do push-ups
- I just did 50!
Are you here to box or do math?
What's 50? 'Do it till you die'
'Do it till you die'
Your guru ALI said that, not me
- I'm off
- Where to?
Our deal's for two hours
Beyond that you pay extra
See you
"With fire in her eyes.."
"She delivers killer blows"
"Fatal punches.."
What's so funny?
Go
- I hear Prabhu's got a new boxer?
- She's just a fishmonger
She takes his money and abuses him
It's a big joke
It's not funny
Keep an eye on them
Got it?
Okay sir
"Face the moment...Rev up your heart
Kick the obstacles in your path"
"Open your mind...Open your heart
Unleash the magical force"
"Magical force"
"Magical force"
"Magical force"
"Magical force"
Go
You made me wait yesterday
So I set my own time today
"Waves of dreams never reach
the shores unless you strive"
"Boundaries drawn by your heart,
will be wiped away by your drive"
"The magical force will propel you,"
"The magical force will carry you"
"The magical force will sustain you!"
"Magical force"
Don't mess with me...
I'm a boxer now
Mind it
You scoundrels!
Leave me
"Heights you've never dreamt of are
yours, just go for them"
"You walk despite the pain,
you're a brave-heart"
"You stop in fear, you've
just died a small death"
"Fight fear, fight to the forefront,
unleash the tornado"
"And till the last round, harden your heart,
you will catapult into eternity"
"The magical force will propel you"
"The magical force will carry you"
"The magical force will sustain you!"
"Magical force"
What the hell are you doing, Madhi?
Good Madhi!
For a pudgy middle aged guy,
you're smile's hot!
Smart ass!
Is this all you know after eight years?
Learn from her
If you're not interested,
get the hell out
Hey, Lux
Why are you always being like this...?
If Master trained me personally,
I'd win too
Don't worry
He knows you're the best
He'll train you
Eat up
Trust me
No! Let mom have it
I'm 24! It's my last shot
at the police job
I found a boxer
I've never seen one like her
Do you remember me
as an orphan in street fights?
She's exactly like
how I was as a teen
Like you? Throw her out
or you'll regret it
She's better than me
Instinctive defence, superb speed...
...Dominating body language
and footwork like dance!
- So?
- She's a born champ
I've never heard you
praise a boxer! Train her
Make sure ready her
coming World Championship
I've handled Dev
You can return soon
Will you come to see her in
the Association Cup next week?
Of course!
Sir...Sir
I thought you're a horny dog, a dastard
I was wrong
Sorry, sir
You chase talent, not skirts
Salute!
Bugger, are you praising or abusing me?
Honesty doesn't pay
I'll shut up!
Get me liver
How much liver will you eat,
you old geezer? You'll die
It's a health funda
Let me tell you a secret
Booze ruins our liver
But if you eat liver while drinking,
then this liver rots...
...and our liver stays safe!
Got it?
Come on
Haven't I told you to
not lower your guard?
Stop staring
Come on!
Howzat! Southpaw
Muhammad Ali
She's a goner!
Super dude
You rocked it
Up! How dare you lower your guard?
You switch from right to
left and think you're Ali?
First get the basics
You touch me again, I'll chop
you and feed fish
- Respect Madhi! I'm your coach
- Screw you and your coaching
You're not paying me to be mauled
Take your sister along
Tell her you've
ruined her career
Get lost
Hey, Madhi
The poor girls face hell everywhere
Be kind to them
Quit interfering or I'll slipper you!
I don't want them to end up
cleaning toilets like you
Yes, I clean shit
 But you stink
What a vile tongue!
You're a bad man
From now, the tournament's your life
Train eight hours a day
and do what I say
Forget your homes and lovers!
Get it duffers?
Take your sister along
Tell her you've ruined her career
Okay...enough
All the best
- Thank you sir
- Carry on
- All the best
- Thank you sir
All the best
Thank you sir
Is that her?
Don't leave her
That's it
Punch her
Yes...punch like that
Stop
Great fight!
Remove head guard
Winning on points, Red's the winner
You're into the next round, right?
Now watch
Huh?
We need glucose
- Take it
- Thank you, sir
Playing Santa again?
Save up or you'll land up
penniless in the garbage bin
If you were a cute baby
someone would adopt you
But you're a nasty bull
TRUE
Focus Madhi
Thiya is Red
Madhi is Blue
First round
Box
Break
Move
What?
Blue, foul
Blue disqualified
- Crazy girl, why did you hit him?
- Now he'll train you alone
She isn't like you
She's worse
Kick her out
I want Madhi for
the National selections in Dharamsala
- I'll take both the girls
- Hey cupcake, who's this gigolo?
Is he matching your complexion?
He's Lux's coachie
He wants to take
the girls with him
Coachie
I disapprove
She supports them
They resemble the hag
with those bruised faces
Who'll marry them? Tell me
My work has finished here
I've been transferred to Hisar
I won't return again
After me, no one will
give a shit about them
They are good boxers
They'll stay in the hostel in my care
Think and tell me
Who'll feed us if Madhi goes?
I'll send money every month
Coachie, give it to the family's boss!
Jesus, bless the coachie!
What did that dastard want?
Stop shouting
He wants you to stay with
him, so you'll focus
With him? No way
He'll kill me
Why?
I starved to make Lux a boxer
Don't ruin it
If Lux is a cop, we get respect
I won't send her alone
Go take care of her
Understand?
Where is that old man?
Hey, move
Do we look like whores?
How dare you come home?
You want us both in your bed
Isn't that your plan, you pervert?
How dare you create
a problem in my shop?
Get out
- Get out
- Leave me
Get out
Come in
Don't break my bike
- Leave my bike alone!
- It's not yours! It's his
I'll break your mouth
Now it's mine! He splurged
on equipment for you...
...and gave his bike as payment
Can you pay me?
I don't know what
the fool sees in you filthy pigs
Pay for the damage
or I'll call the police
Let her go
I hate him more than you do
You think he's after your body
You're wrong
He can get a beauty for half
the money he gives you
He always gave you the best
He emptied his pockets
for your training
We saw you as a foul fishmonger
But he saw your talent
He trusts you
Madhi
Think before you decide
'I'm not interested in your body'
'You're not getting it even if you crawl'
"Hey fighter, your big eyes are
pouncing on my soul dear"
"Stop the play of fists"
"And start the play of the lips"
"I ache to chase away the loneliness"
"Open your heart and
make me your princess"
"I'll find you, I'll hug you,
and I'll make you mine"
"Oh yes I will!"
"Will hover around you, will take
you into me, and make you mine"
"Oh yes I will!"
"Oh my handsome enemy,
I walked far away from you"
"But I don't know when I walked towards you
For when I woke up, I'm inside you"
"What spell did you cast and tie me up?"
"I wrote myself into a book, you just
tore away my diffidence"
"I'll find you, I'll hug you,
and I'll make you mine"
"Oh yes I will!"
"Will hover around you, will take
you into me, and make you mine"
"Oh yes I will!"
"Like a tiny boat in a stream,
love floats in me like a dream"
"When I see you, my soul
rolls out to reach you"
"Don't you pity me? Look at me please
Don't ignore me"
"Throw a look and watch crazy me"
Take it
Master's calling you
Come fast
Not you
Just Madhi
Wait Lux...I'll come
"I ache to chase away the loneliness"
"Open your heart and
make me your princess"
"I'll find you, I'll hug you, and
I'll make you mine"
"Oh yes I will!"
"Will hover around you, will take
you into me, and make you mine"
"Oh yes I will!"
Master, we've a bet going
Is Tyson your idol or Ali?
Genghis Khan
A Pakistani boxer? Heavy weight?
Idiot, he was a king, not a boxer!
Genghis Khan was just a puny guy
A Mongolian
But what guts!
He conquered Asia easily
but the Europeans were formidable
They were huge with strong armours
A head-on confrontation was impossible
So what did he do?
He knew the enemy's strength
lay in his weapons
To win, one has to destroy the enemy's
weapons or strengthen one's own
He did both
To destroy their armoury, he invented
the 'Composite Bow'
While fighting, he feigned retreat...
...unexpectedly turned around and
shot at them from a speeding horse
The enemy was vanquished
If you wreck an enemy's weapons,
how will he fight?
But how's this connected to boxing?
The day you get it, you'll be selected
Shut up
I'm going back to Hisar
I'll take only one boxer for
the World Cup selections
- Wish you all the best
- Thank you master
Be brave
All the best
Don't mess it up
Red corner Luxmi
Blue corner Anju
First round...box
Stop
To the corner
Unanimous decision
Blue's the winner
Don't cry
Seconds out
Fourth round
Damn! What are you doing here?
- Fish curry! I made it
- Thanks Madhi
Do I look good?
Put on tracks and get in the ring
- Why? Don't I look good?
- You look butt ugly
You're beautiful to me when you fight
hard with that ugly mouth guard
Come on, let's go
Come, it is late
Don't lie master
I know you like me
I love you, master
- Huh?
- I love you
It's normal to get
distracted at your age
You're not the first student to say it
It is normal
Forget it
But you've said I'm unique
Madhi, focus
I'm your dad's age
I know many men my dad's age
I don't profess love to them
What the hell do
I do if I've fallen for you?
It's my first, I'm not scared
Why are you?
You must've said it to many
Tell me also or I'll throw the fight
Concentrate on boxing
Selections aren't a joke
Go train, moron
I'm not kidding
What's with that stupid grin?
- Tell me
- Nothing!
Are you crazy?
Madhi, you're on next!
Show me your hand
Give her the first-aid
Wrap it up tight
I'll manage
Blue corner, Madhi
Red corner, Dhiksha
First round
Box
Madhi, raise your guard
Raise your guard, idiot!
You shouldn't have chosen her
She's throwing the match
Stop
Unanimous decision
Red is the winner
I didn't do it on purpose
Master, please...
How much ever you pamper
a stray dog, it will only eat shit
When you're about to achieve big,
all you think of is getting laid
I'm a bloody fool...
...I thought you'd become a champion
and achieve what I couldn't
Get lost!
Crawl back to your filth
Die
Don't beat yourself up
At least Lux's made it
Oh She's a devil
She has no emotions
- And you do?
- Shut up!
We helped the coachie earn blessings
by taking his monthly Rs 3000 dole
- She has ruined that too
- Shut up you creep!
The things will happen as fate decides
You are to blame
The moment I touched you was inauspicious
Is she my sperm?
Madhi! What are you doing?
What are you doing?
Hey, let her go
It's my fault that I was smitten by white
skin and married you...damn North Indian!
Don't act smart with me
"You prick with a needle
the very nerves of my life and breath"
"You lay my heart down and
shroud it with a white cloth"
"Don't make my eyes search
so desperately for you"
"Don't stoke the flames with your
absence and burn me down"
"Don't ignore me and extinguish my breath"
"Don't finish me off, 'cos I've
come here despite myself"
"My broken smile lies scattered in pieces
when will you come to gather it?"
"My heart is shattered with your memories,
please make me yours"
"I ran in the direction from where I got
the smell of your heart"
"In the storm around, I searched for
the breath that would lead me to you"
"I searched for you"
"Don't make my eyes search
so desperately for you"
"Don't stoke the flames with your
absence and burn me down"
"Don't ignore me and extinguish my breath"
"Don't finish me off, 'cos I've
come here despite myself"
"My broken smile lies scattered in pieces
when will you come to gather it?"
"My heart is shattered with your memories,
please make me yours"
Tell her I'm making her fight
in the Cultural exchange tournament...
...and send her to Delhi
Got it?
Okay, sir
Sure, sir
I'll put her on the list
Okay, sir
Thank you, sir
Dev's reeling in the fishmonger!
My dear Madhi!
The Associations called you back
You're going to Delhi
You are going to fight in
the Cultural exchange tournament
Dev Khatris recommended you
for the tournament
Hey, our Madhi is going to Delhi
Madhi! Be ready to
show your boxing there
Aren't you Prabhu's student?
You wanna experience
international boxing?
Wanna fight the Russian, Natalia?
Sir, the Russians in a heavier category
but madhi fights light weight category
Did you win Asian Games gold in 1980?
Or get National sports award
'Arjuna award' in 1990?
 Or get 'Dronacharya Award' in 1996
for your excellence coaching?
I'm confused as to who is
the National head coach now
She's a higher weight category
Will you fight or not?
I never said I wouldn't
Good
That's the spirit!
Get ready
Anyway you'll lose
You can't beat her
Just go swing your arms
Shake hands

Some in
and sit
Does it hurt?
Close the door
Don't feel bad about losing
You're talented
I tried, sir
Don't worry
Forget it
I gave you this chance
I'll make you represent India next
Come close to me
That's the end of your career, bitch
Why are you glaring at me?
Like you didn't do it with Prabhu sir
Shut up
Master never touched me
No wonder he dumped you!
Talent alone isn't enough
Ask Lux
Break it...faster
That's my locker
Move aside
From where did you get this money?
Did you steal it from the Association?
I didn't steal
You'll never box again
Don't mess with Dev
Come
What happened, madam?
I didn't steal it
I'm being framed
- Why are you taking her?
- Come and talk to me in the station?
Move
"I ran in the direction from where I got
the smell of your heart"
"In the storm around, I searched for
the breath that would lead me to you"
"I searched for you"
"I searched for you"
"Don't make my eyes search
so desperately for you"
"Don't stoke the flames with your
absence and burn me down"
"Don't ignore me and extinguish my breath"
"Don't finish me off, 'cos I've
come here despite myself"
"My broken smile lies scattered in pieces
when will you come to gather it?"
"My heart is shattered with your memories,
please make me yours"
Master, I messed up
Forgive me
Please, master
Please help me
Don't hit her
Please leave
I am to blame, master
All I want is to box, I swear
Master, save me
Take that phone from her
Master, please
Had you waited, the inspector
would've agreed to a smaller bribe
I'd have paid double if required
Move aside
Sir...sir
Remember?
'Why should I help?'
'I wash my ass,
not others' ass'
Sir!
You're a good man
Forget the past
It's okay if you
haven't won a qualifier...
...you win the trials, you'll go
to the World Championship
Focus on boxing
I'll take care of the rest
Yes, master
Hi, master
Come, Madhi
Give me your bag
I'll carry it
My hand's fine now
I'll shift your roommate to other room
Madhi can stay with you
I'll be fine on my own
The lech
 He's obsessed!
What've you done to him?
And your 'innocent' look?
Teach me too
Why the hell do you have to box?
I should've broken
your hand for good
I know you did it
But, did I question you?
I fought with a broken
hand and was trashed
Did I tattle?
I worked my ass off
for you guys
What about all that I've done?
I can't even talk about it
Had I got the police job, I'd have
sorted your lives too
If you'd said 'don't box',
I would've given it up
But now I'll box for me and
for the man who believes in me
You want boxing?
You'll box huh?
Are you able to do boxing now?
Will you do boxing again?
Lux, leave her alone!
Stop it
Stop
Hey stop
Are you mad?
Go to your room
Why? So you can take
her to your room?
Madhi, you can go
Go to your room
Why didn't you train me
like you trained her?
Because she's better than you
That's all
Aiyo Master
- Madhi
- Master
The girl hasn't won a thing
She hit a referee and in national
she lost with shame
And now you bring her
for world championship
Using your influence huh?
I'm sure you haven't heard of
World Cup trials!
What else to expect of pea brained
guys gobbling free peas patties?
Come and see in the trails, sir
Look around Madhi
Everyone dislikes you
They want you to lose
Because you're my student
One mistake and
they'll bury you
What do you want?
A knockout
You can't win on points
Is that all?
"Let not the target leave your sight
Focus with all your might"
"Your spark is as tiny as an electron
Just go and ignite it"
"Fight fear, fight to the forefront,
unleash the tornado"
"And till the last round, harden your heart,
you will catapult to untamed heights"
"The magical force
will propel you"
"The magical force
will propel you"
”Don’t lose hope
You’ll get help to revive”
"The magical force will make you
catapult to untamed heights"
"The magical force
will propel you"
Madhi has proven that she's the force
to reckon with by reaching the final
Fisherwoman from Chennai is to
fight 3 times world champion Natalia
Natalia beat you before
Can you win now?
As long as master's with me,
I can beat anyone
India is hoping for a miracle from this
young fighter Madhi to come out shining
Enough...go
Hey! Why aren't you at the wine shop?
You'll die
She called sobbing
Lux lost
The little one's on TV
I'm stealing cable to watch
Hurry! I'll call everyone
Come to watch
Madhi’s match on TV today
Madhi’s match today
Don’t miss it
Bring mother to watch Madhi’s match
Next
Madhi
Lightweight India
Your name's not in the list
Next
Master
- What's the problem?
- Her name's not in the list
- But she's won the semis
- Ask the Association...next
Relax
I'll be back
Why isn't Madhi on the list?
What is your problem?
Guys, give us 5 minutes please
Thank you
You're back to your shitty tricks
She won in semi final
Why isn't her name there?
September 12, 1996, Olympic selection...
you hit me in front of everyone
14th August 2001, National Meet,
Chandigarh...
...you told the Press
that I didn't know boxing
- January 28th...
- Why are you raking up the past?
The wound's gone
but the scar remains
She'll fail the dope test
Both of you'll be humiliated
The problem is between us
Why are you
punishing her?
If she fails, you do too
Don't do this
This isn't about you,
me or the girl
It's about women's boxing
Please Dev
Of course it's about you and me
Boxing's my life too
I want the fame
But you always intercede
I hate your face
Don't waste your time
Leave
What do I have to do
to get Madhi to fight?
Dev, what should I do?
Do resign
Let her fight
Come in
Give me your ID card
Hereon, don't coach, box,
or come to the Federation
Come on take it off
If I see you in the stadium,
I'll disqualify her
Oh my! You've swallowed all that
arrogance to lick my feet?
Is she that good in bed?
Please introduce her to me
You don't get it, do you?
You're beyond help
Make sure she fights
Come on
Why are you sitting here?
Follow me
Come here
Come dear
Where's master?
Give it
- Hello sir
- Hello
Where's my master?
Just come
Where is my master?
He's resigned and bolted
Dev sir's your coach now
You go to ready
Hereafter he won't come
Please leave sir
I'd sell fish, hog biriyani and
sleep happy
You made me dream big
and now you desert me
I'm sure you've a reason
But I'm a dumb bitch
I can't understand
So explain
Have I screwed up again?
- Tell master
- Madhi!
I didn't regret resigning to make you
fight, 'cos boxing's my life
Don't make me regret it
Fight for me, you, and
the millions of girls out there
Show the world
this Madhi I know
Right master
I'll fight
You've thrown away
everything for me...
...and if this isn't love,
what is it?
A few years ago if someone had said India
would host the World Championship...
...and India could even
win, I'd have laughed
But today it's a reality!
India's rookie boxer, E.Madhi with
coach Dev Khatri
And here comes
the defending champion
Three time World Champion,
Russia's Natalia Raiker
In their last encounter, Natalia
knocked out Madhi in eight seconds
Russia's brilliant game plan...
...Natalia made to lose weight and
fight in a lower category
Shake hands
First round
Box
What a powerful hook!
She can win
She has everything but the will
She has the style and power
but not her favourite coach there
Natalia's easily beating Madhi
It's a classic mismatch
Will you let her go at any cost?
Please go sir
Not every girl's like that
bitch ex-wife of yours
Sir-
Please convince him
I'm the Chennai coach and you?
I am Murali Krishnan
The bitch, his ex-wife's father
Madhi is getting hit thoroughly
Natalia in her best form
Another fantastic upper cut and hook
Thank God
Madhi's saved by the bell
Break for correct time
- Go closer! She has a better reach
- Has my master come?
He won't
Madhi's endured the onslaught so far
but needs to score soon
Points has not increased
She's gonna lose!
Jesus, save her
Oh Jesus, protect my little girl
Seconds out
Second round
Madhi should score in this round
If Madhi goes on like earlier round,
India is sure to lose
Eight
Are you okay?
Box
Saved by the bell again
End of the second round
Madhi's in a lot of pain
Will she continue?
Security
Go to Stand A
- Has my master come?
- Come!
Madhi seems to be injured
If the doctor declares her unfit,
she forfeits the match
The nation waits with bated breath
Are you okay?
Fantastic right hook!
'Genghis Khan knew that the enemy's
strength lay in his weapons'
'If you destroy the enemy's weapons,
how will he fight?'
Madhi's hitting her arms
Don’t know why Madhi
is attacking her arms
I hope she knows
there are no points in that!
Ridiculous! Why's she hitting
the arms over and over?
Another straight punch from Natalia
She gets more points
Go for the face!
Stop...stop
Don’t know what Madhi is trying to do
Natalia's scored 5 points more
Why are you hitting her arms?
Hit her face!
Go get her!
Go
Seconds out
Fourth round
Box
The final 50 seconds
Nothing much
Madhi can do now
What is this?
Madhi's lowered her guard
Madhi looks tired
Has she lost confidence?
Has she given up?
Truly disappointing!
Knockout
The winner by a knockout...
...and the new world champion in the
lightweight category is E.Madhi from India
Sir, our Madhi have won
Come on, sir
What a victory!
What an unprecedented moment!
What a strategy!
She's beaten a three time World Champion,
giving India a gold and the Championship
A slum dweller, a fishmonger from
Chennai's made the impossible possible!
A historic moment!
An unbelievable victory!
Madhi's a testament to
the resilience of Indian women
Not just Madhi
Women's boxing world champion Madhi
Forgive me
You were right
Like I always say,
kill the politics in boxing...
...and you'll find
a champion every street
My student's done India proud!
My student!
She is my...
'After just five years of
Women's boxing in the nation...'
'...India won the Women's World
Boxing Championship in 2006'
'Did you know?'
