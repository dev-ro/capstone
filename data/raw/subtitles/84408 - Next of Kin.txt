- To my daughter,
Linda Mary Stevens,
I leave my entire inheritance.
All goods, chattles
and worldly possessions
that comprise the
estate of Montclare.
Thunderstorms bringing in
a cooler change later on today.
There'll be some
rain again tonight
and tomorrow we can
expect yet another fine
and warm day.
While we're talking in the
studio today,
residents in the area or even
the tourists
that might be listening
would like to run over
a few of these
procedures for us.
- Certainly would, Ryan.
And needless to say there's
a fire ban on lighting fires
in the open right now.
We should clear all combustible
materials
from around your home
or your caravan even.
And all rubbish down at
the gathering.
- Easy on the onions, Harry.
- No worries.
- Oy, dad.
- Nico, where
you been, huh?
- With Linda.
- Oh, good day, Linda.
- Hi.
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.
- Nico, get a cup of coffee for
Linda, eh?
- Come, look, you haven't
even eaten your egg there.
Come on, Louis, don't play with
your food.
Here look, I'll feed you.
- What do you think of
the old time, Linda?
Not much changed huh?
- Hardly at all.
- Well there's a new
public toilet.
Took them 20 years to get that
one up.
' Change?
- Don't you look at me
like that, young man.
You want me to knock you through
to the middle of next week?
Come closer so I can hit
you, Jason.
Get here and eat up.
- On the house.
- A test of nerves.
- Watch this.
- Hey Harry, come on,
hurry up.
- Two hamburgers coming up.
Nico!
Nico!
- There we go.
And about time too, kid.
- I'm sorry about your
mother, Linda.
She was a good woman,
Miss Berry.
- Thanks.
- She used to come
in here sometimes, you know?
- My mother?
- Yeah.
Used to sit over in that corner
for a long while.
Just looking out of the window
as if,
as if something was on her mind,
you know.
Nico liked her.
He liked her very much.
He used to sit with her.
No talking.
Just sitting.
What you gonna do with that
big house now, Linda, huh?
- Lance, what are you doing?
- Hmm, watering the flowers.
- A bit?
Come and help me take the
washing in.
- I think it's going to rain.
Our loves and comforts
should increase
even as our days do go.
- Here, grab this.
- Hope it's a good
storm, I like the rain.
- Now mother and father
have gone,
we have the problem of
maintaining Montclare.
We're determined not to sell it.
I suggested to Rita that we
might turn it
into a nursing home and she
seemed to like the idea.
25th of August, 1950.
- Shit.
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, Connie.
I can't close it.
We'll have to get it repaired.
- You should be careful.
- What's that?
- The wires.
- Let's get out of here.
- Do you think it's a good
idea moving
your mother's belongings
right now?
- It's got to be done sometime.
- The old people are a
little sensitive.
It's best when they're
all asleep.
- Whose room is this?
- The new arrival.
- What's she talking about?
- Somebody's gotta do the
flowers. - Mrs. Ryan.
Her nephew's bringing her
up tonight.
- We've already discussed this.
I don't want to take any
more people.
- We need the money.
- Yes I know, but one
more person
isn't going to make
any difference.
It's just all too much.
- Oh no, it's just maintenance.
And the old for their mind,
they still love it here.
- You're a great optimist,
Connie.
I better see Mr. Collins.
Cold night, Mr. Collins.
How are your eyes?
Let's have a look.
Head back.
Look at the ceiling.
- Good god.
- You'll get soaked!
I'll get them.
Come on, let's get you inside.
- They're crazy.
- You should have gone
to the front entrance.
- We got lost.
The lightning nearly got us.
- You should be in bed.
- Oh, rubbish.
And miss all the fun?
- Damn, door's locked.
- Look, you'll have to walk.
- I was locked out of
the barracks.
It was teeming with rain just
like this.
' Cathy!
- Enemy shell
started exploding
all over the bloody camp.
- What happened?
- The door slammed?
- Didn't you slip the lock?
I'm sorry Mr. Ryan.
You must be tired after your
long journey.
This is Linda, Mr. Cooney.
Mrs. Ryan and Mr. Ryan.
- Kelvin.
- Wasn't your Aunt
happy in the last house?
- They weren't happy.
- Then I got back and I
put it like anyone here,
thunder was coming
and explosions
all over the bloody place.
I didn't know what the
hell to do.
And you know, it doesn't
often rain in North Africa
but my god, when it does it does
come down
in buckets and lumps.
- Good heavens.
- I'll take care of Mrs. Ryan.
- Come on Lance.
- You better stay the night,
Mr. Ryan.
We've got a spare room upstairs.
- Come on.
- Well anyhow, there I was.
I'd locked out of the barracks.
I couldn't get in no
matter how much I yelled.
- Bags with Cynthia.
- Is this the new one?
- Yes.
- If we get any more,
we'd have to stick them
up the chimney.
- Anyhow, what can I do?
I couldn't get into
the barracks.
I said the only thing to
do is walk
back to the latrine.
While I was on the way
there, halfway there
then whoah, a whacking shell
just blew the dunny sky high.
- Lance has been
like a father to Linda.
He drove with me into
town today to buy Linda
a birthday present, a red ball.
Then in his usual
absent minded way
forgot to pay Mr. Foley.
I discreetly settled the bill.
Thursday.
Someone was wandering
around the house last night.
I didn't sleep.
- It's from my niece.
Shelly.
- What is it?
- I have no idea.
- Hey, turn that thing off.
You make the telly go all fuzzy.
All the fuss about,
never stops cleaning,
that woman.
- Morning.
Mrs. Collins and Lance not
here yet.
- Lance usually waits till
the last one's finished.
Thinks he gets better service
that way
even though the food gets cold.
- We'll have to do something
about that fallen tree.
- I've organised it.
We'll manage.
- I might go into town
and get you some oranges.
Would you like some sherry?
I'll get you some sherry.
- The dry one?
- The dry one.
Look I think this place is
gonna do you a lot of good.
- How you been?
- Okay-
- You look great.
- Where's your car?
- I lost my licence.
Here I come!
Woo!
- Yuck.
This water stinks.
I hate dead flowers.
You know I didn't miss
her at first.
She had secrets.
Here.
- Oh, thank you.
- I suppose you think
I'm like her.
- YUP-
- Unreliable.
- Mhmm.
- Unpredictable.
- Uh-huh.
- Crazy.
- Oh yes.
- Good.
- You haven't changed.
- What has?
- Plenty.
What do you wanna know?
- Nothing.
- Not even that Tom's
got a new stud phone?
Lucy Parker, the fat girl?
- God, no.
- None in New Guinea.
- There's a place for her.
- Doreen Lauren.
- No.
I don't wanna know.
- Molly Fleming.
Stepped up his bulldozer under
the tracks.
And his head popped like
a watermelon!
Woohoo!
Yeehah!
- Barney?
Barney.
Barney!
I can hear you.
I know you're hiding.
Barney?
Barney.
I can see you.
Come on Barney, what are
you doing?
Barney?
- Hello.
- There's someone watching us.
- I can't see anyone.
- Standing between those
two trees.
- Want me to check it out?
It's all right, it's just
like a ripper.
You got any friends up there?
- A few.
- What kind of school is it?
- It's a special school for
emotionally disturbed kids.
- Something bugging you?
- NO.
- Bullshit.
- I don't know, it's just
that I feel unwelcome.
- What do you expect after so
many years?
No letters, no phone calls.
People are curious, that's all.
Hey, there's a party on
at Pete Barker's tonight.
You wanna come?
- Pete Barker.
- Bet you haven't had a
night out
since you been back.
- And I suppose you'll
need a lift.
- True.
True.
' BYE bye.
Stay well.
- Linda, it's Mr. Collins.
He's dead.
Died in his bath.
Lance found him.
Dr. Barton's with Lance now.
- How is he?
- Minor stroke.
- It's all right.
I'm here.
- He's resting now, Linda.
He's gonna sleep properly soon.
- It's okay.
- Knowing Lance, he'll
probably be up and about
in a couple days.
You heard about Collins?
It's his heart.
Anyway, you can safely leave
all that to Connie and me.
There's nothing you need to do.
There.
Anyway, how are things with you?
- Coping-
Just
- Look.
If there's anything I can do.
- NO.
- Well you have got Connie.
She's a fine woman.
In fact during the last couple
of months
of your mother's life she
practically ran
this place single handed.
- What exactly was wrong
with mother?
- Stress, anxiety.
She was worried about money,
worried about Montclare.
It all contributed.
- I might sell Montclare.
- Could be a wise decision.
Be a pity though.
It's been in the family for a
long time.
Linda, I really would
like to help
so why don't you drop around
to the surgery sometime.
After all, I brought you into
this world
so I have some responsibility.
- Now Carol, Mrs. Comry,
it's Barney.
Yeah that's right.
Eh?
How long ago did she leave?
Good.
Okay, thanks.
You don't mind?
- NO.
Who were you talking to?
- Um, Pete.
How's Lance?
- He's all right,
I think.
He's had a shock.
- Don't bother changing,
we should get going.
- It won't take me a sec.
Almost there.
Oh, who's that?
- I think it's Carol.
- Carol?
What's she doing here?
- Well, actually she's
running us to the party.
- Not Carol.
- I'll tell her to get gone.
- Well, I don't think
I'll come tonight, Barney.
- Look, it's no trouble.
- No really, I should
stay and look after Lance.
I'm worried about him.
- Have a nice day?
- Terrific.
- We could probably
squeeze you in the back
if you had a loose end.
- No, I'm exhausted.
I'll probably fall asleep.
- Suit yourself.
- Sure you don't
wanna change your mind?
- Come on, Barnes.
- Barnes?
- Oh, bloody keys!
Honey, sick with your band?
Sleep tight.
- Shouldn't
you tell Linda at least?
- What for?
It was just a coincidence.
- If you're sure.
- I was
here then, you weren't.
Trust me.
Come here.
- Come in.
- Not going out, Linda?
- No, I changed my mind.
I can look after things
here if you two want to,
- Ah, that's very kind of you.
- Hettie's gone for the weekend.
- We'll manage.
- I'm sure you will.
- Night then, enjoy yourselves.
- Thank you, Linda.
- Hey, what do you want?
Hmm?
Aw.
Dame.
Ooh.
Bye.
Dr. R. B.
Rita?
250.
R.B. Rita?
Doctor R.B.
Barton?
Damn.
Here, puss, puss.
Puss, puss.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, puss, puss, puss, puss.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty.
Here, puss, puss, puss,
puss, puss, puss, puss.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
come on.
Ah, who did this?
Oh, Mrs. Peterson, what
are you doing?
- I heard a noise,
I thought that,
- It's nothing,
go back to bed.
- The lights.
- I'm going to fix them now.
Go on, go back to bed.
Spooks.
Hello?
- Linda.
- Hi, Barney.
Where are you?
- I'm at work.
Cold, isn't it?
- Is it?
- Yeah, freezing.
I walked half a mile
to find this phone box.
Look, um.
I wanna see you.
' Oh, do you?
I'm on my own.
- Where's Connie?
Linda?
- What?
- Where's Connie?
- She's gone out.
- Eh?
Well where's she gone?
- Hey, you having a good time?
- No.
" Why not?
Drunk?
- Sober.
That what it is.
- What's that?
Barney?
Stay there.
- Linda?
Can you hear me?
Linda?
Linda!
Shit.
- Barney?
How did you get down here?
Come on.
Hurry UP-
Shit.
- Hey, shh.
It's me, okay?
It's only me.
- Oh, Barney.
I don't know what's happening.
There was somebody in
the bathroom.
- Hey-
Wake up.
- Now when you've all got
your hats and your capes
and your scarves on,
please go straight
to the bus outside,
is that clear?
Right to the bus where
you'll be helped aboard
by Simon and myself.
Don't leave your purse
behind, dear.
Somebody“ take that.
Does everybody got a warm thing?
- I can't hear you.
- We're going on a
lovely scenic tour.
- I can't hear you.
- We're going on a scenic
tour, darling.
Out in the bus, outside.
See, out there.
- Lance?
- Come on ladies,
come on ladies.
- Someone missing, Simon?
We seem to be a couple short.
- Couple short?
- Not really joking, that koala,
you know,
I saw that blokes' lips move.
- Lance.
Let's get you back to bed.
I think they all went.
Pity you missed out.
Suppose you wouldn't have
gone anyway, would you?
Did you open your window
last night?
I went over the accounts.
They're a real mess.
How do you feel?
You remember my aunt Rita?
When did she die?
- No, no.
- What's that?
- Didn't die.
- Oh, it's Carol.
I'll look in on you later.
Carol?
Connie?
Connie?
- Over here.
- Did you see who was
driving Carol just now?
- Was she here?
- Course she was here.
Her beret was in the pond
this morning.
- Oh?
- There was someone in
the house last night.
Someone turned off the lights
and all the taps in my
room were left running.
- Why would she do that?
- She?
- You said Carol was here.
- Carol.
- It's probably one of
the old folk.
You look tired.
- Why was I told my aunt Rita
was dead?
- Isn't she?
It was all before my time.
- There was someone in
the house.
- Well if you like,
I'll report it.
Will you be back for tea?
- You take care of
your mother now, you hear?
- No answer.
- Where do you think she is?
- I don't know.
She had a too bit to
drink last night.
- There was someone driving
her car.
- Hey, you gotta get out of
that house.
If you like, you can stay at
my place.
- NO.
- Right.
Well the voluntary bush
fire brigade
is holding its annual
meeting at the hall tonight.
Could be a bit of a hoot.
Plus a good fire out.
- She did die.
- When?
- Does it matter?
- Yes.
- Why?
- Because she's my aunt.
My family.
I need to know.
- She's dead.
Isn't that enough?
I know you're very fond of Lance
but he's a confused old man.
Ever since his first
stroke he's been living
more and more in the past.
Well, what he remembers of the
past.
- But he said she didn't die.
- Not in Montclare, no.
Your mother couldn't
cope, Linda,
because your aunt was a very
sick woman.
Finally she had to be sent to
a home.
And that's where she died.
- In some of the account books,
there are recent payments made
out to her
care of you.
- Linda.
You know what your mother
was like with the accounts.
They're a mess.
Listen.
Connie rang me, she's
very worried about you.
Are you sleeping okay?
- Fine.
- Don't go digging into the
past, Linda.
It's gone, forget it.
- Who's there?
Is there anyone?
- Linda?
- There was someone in my room.
- There's no one here.
- Wearing my mother's coat in my
room!
- The house is empty.
- I saw someone.
- Linda, what are you saying?
There's only Lance and myself.
- And Lance is, is asleep.
- I have no strength to
write now.
My mind is wandering.
I cannot live with that
memory of the past anymore
yet the terrible pain of
memory increases.
Connie is concerned about me.
I have spent the past
week in bed.
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- NO.
- You should try getting
some sleep.
Can I get you anything?
- No, I'm fine.
- I am returning
to the past so much now.
Yet I cannot erase from my mind
the events of those
fearful days 20 years ago.
I have been hearing noises in
the house.
Strange sounds all night
long that keep me awake.
Lights going on and off.
Taps left running.
My door was open during
the night.
I have not slept.
There is something evil in
this house.
Something that lives and
breathes the same air.
Linda somehow wandered into
the bathroom
to discover the body of
Mr. Holden
lying in the bath.
Drowned.
This morning, my friend,
Frida Cartwright
was found dead in her bath.
What is happening?
And now I know there is
evil here in this house.
Mr. Carmady was found
in the bathroom, dead.
It is nearly dawn.
I'm afraid to sleep.
The house is full of whispering.
Dr. Barton came again today.
- Where is she?
- Upstairs.
- Where's
everybody else?
- The bus broke down, they've
billeted out for the night.
- Good.
- Waterman.
Thompson.
Cartwright.
Leslie, Holden.
Carmady.
Carmady.
Cause of death, pneumonia?
Sclerosis?
Coma?
Barton.
Barton, Barton.
- I tried to
get hold of you earlier.
She was in her room
all afternoon.
She was very upset.
- She found out I was lying.
- Does it matter now?
- Of course it matters.
- Someone's been at
the files.
I gotta look at this.
- What are you doing?
- There's, there's marks on
the neck.
Scratches.
You said it was a heart attack.
- Linda, those marks were made
by Connie
and the other residents trying
to lift him
out of the bath.
- Don't come near me.
- Tell her, you must!
- Linda, take it easy.
Linda!
- There's no reason why we
can't be in the top three.
Let's not come seventh
like last year.
And as you know, I'm
at the top of the game
entering into the regional
competition.
Last of all fellows,
it relies on teamwork.
I want you to be familiar with
the equipment on both trucks.
The Old Austin and the Inter.
If there's anything you're
still not sure about,
just talk to Ken or myself.
But for Christ's sake,
" Barney!
- For Christ's sake,
don't just shrug something off
as hard X Joe bloke's
job. - Barney!
- Because Joe Blow's
probably off
doing someone else's job,
all right?
" Barney!
- Winning means teamwork!
Less drinking and more thinking.
If for some reason you
can't make it next Saturday
because you plan on having
a fight
with your missus or something,
George, do you wanna?
- For Christ's sake!
- I don't know.
- Listen to me.
Look at me.
Look at me!
Hey, stop it.
Listen to me.
You're fine.
Okay?
Calm down.
All right?
You calm?
Okay.
Just listen to me, all right?
We're gonna go for a
little walk.
Then we're gonna talk
about this thing, okay?
Just you and me, all right?
Okay?
So who are we going to worry?
Woof the dog, flagged out nurse,
or a bunch of old buggers?
Nothing much to worry about
there, is it?
- Barney, do you believe me?
- Nope.
Yeah.
Hup!
So where do I find these papers?
Desk?
- Connie's desk.
I put them in the drawer.
I think I'll stay here.
- All right.
You get scared, just give
us a yell.
- Barney.
What if?
- Don't worry.
If we have to, we'll get
the whole buddy fire brigade
to come down and piss on them.
" Barney!
Barney!
Barney?
Barn?
Lance!
It's me, hurry.
He's coming.
Huff)'-
Run.
Lance, hurry!
Go!
- Who is it?
- This is my house, Linda.
I lived here, once.
20 years, they sent me away.
- Rita.
- It was your mother.
She was the one.
She and Barton, they
signed the papers,
sent me away.
They wasted my life.
Do you know all the time, she
was the one.
She was the mad one.
- No, no!
- It's all right.
There, there.
Shh.
There.
It's all right.
It'll all be over soon.
' No!
No!
No, no!
Stay off!
Stay off!
- Junior!
I can see you.
Get away!
Linda.
Linda.
Linda.
- Nico!
Harry, its me!
Harry, Harry!
- Can't you hear them?
- Where's Harry?
- Why?
- Where is he?
- Gone out
shooting rabbits.
- Lock the door.
- Why?
- Lock it.
Has Harry got another gun?
- Yes.
- Get it.
- Why?
- Just get it.
Shut the door after you.
Hurry!
- Like a coffee?
Hamburger?
Bowl of grubble?
Did you and Barney have
an argument?
Holly waffle?
Kit kat?
Minties?
An ice cream?
Chicken roll?
P as“?
Holy shit!
Linda!
Linda!
Let's get out of here!
Linda, Linda!
Come on, hurry!
Come on, hurry!
Come on.
