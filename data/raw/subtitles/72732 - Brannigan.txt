This is Captain Moretti to Unit 5.
Pick up Brannigan.
Use a forklift if you have to,
but get him.
APB on Lieutenant James Brannigan.
Knock knock.
Breaking and entering
is against the law, Brannigan.
I rang. You didn't answer.
I was working.
Doing your own engraving now?
Hey, wouldn't know old Abe
without his mole.
Where's Larkin?
No serial number, no prints,
can't be traced.
Nobody'll know who dumped you.
I don't spook, Brannigan.
Oh, all right.
The government wants Larkin for taxes.
The Chicago Police
want him for extortion.
Cut out the dedicated cop act.
Everybody in this town
knows you want Larkin.
And the grand jury finally indicts him
and he disappears like a short beer.
I'll give you five seconds
to tell me where.
You count.
Hey, wait a minute, wait, okay.
He left town.
- How?
- I don't know.
- Where?
- I don't know.
No, wait a minute, I don't know.
You got to believe me.
All right, cool it.
You must be getting old, Angell.
Trying to push second-rate
paper like this.
Manny, this is Warehouse 17,
Polk Street,
I got a paperhanger.
Turn around, big man.
Angell, you're a real bush leaguer.
Yeah.
You know something,
I don't think it's loaded.
You dirty, lousy Mick, you got no rules.
You got no...
Are you all right?
Are you all right, Jim?
Now listen, Jim, Moretti's steaming.
He's got the whole Chicago PD
looking for you.
Nice to be wanted.
You're wanted, all right.
There's an APB out on you.
Listen, Brannigan, you're dead.
There's a contract out on you.
Try explaining that
to your parole officer.
Larkin's put up 25 Gs
to get you knocked off.
You're gonna be walking down the street,
or sleeping, or sitting on the can,
and the next minute, Brannigan,
you are dead! You lousy Mick, you!
Brannigan.
He's on the inside, far end of 17.
Not him.
Who?
You.
The Captain wants to see you. Now.
You got a warrant?
I don't need a warrant, Jim.
You're a public menace.
- All right.
- Get in.
It's my car.
Joe will bring your car.
Careful with the paint job.
British Airways Flight 570,
nonstop 747 to London,
will depart from the B Concourse.
Well, you made it.
All right, Captain, you going someplace?
No, Lieutenant. You are.
I am?
What is this, Moretti?
Passport, airline ticket
and $500 expenses.
I packed a bag for you.
That is my bag.
I put everything in that was clean.
Here, don't catch a cold.
Moretti, you're gonna make somebody
a nice little wife.
I'm doing you a favor, Jim.
Yeah?
Ben Larkin got out of town
a couple of days ago.
I know that.
He's in London. Scotland Yard's got him.
- London?
- You got extradition papers.
Miss Allen.
I thought you might like
to bring him back
and personally kick him in a cell.
Miss Allen,
this is Lieutenant Brannigan.
- Hi.
- She'll find a seat for you.
All right.
Just follow me, Lieutenant.
Anywhere.
Nice day.
Want to walk, Mel?
All right, you're on.
By the right.
Keep up, there.
First order of business.
Call off the wolves.
Even the elevator man looks like
he's from Scotland Yard.
It may not be as simple as that.
What broke loose?
The word was in the street, Ben.
Somebody talked, somebody listened.
Chicago is sending Jim Brannigan over
with extradition papers and handcuffs.
He'll be at Heathrow anytime now.
I told you I wanted
that big Irish bastard wasted.
It's being taken care of, Ben.
That won't help
your extradition problem.
There'll only be a dozen Chicago cops
on the next flight with more papers.
Well, I'm not running. I like this town.
I like the women, the clubs, the action.
I always did.
Ben, please.
Listen to what I worked out.
Now, in Devon,
at an airport nobody's used for years,
I've got a pilot
who'll take you to Ireland,
where you'll skip immigration
and customs.
Then you head on south
to Ecuador, Venezuela.
Oh, that's just great.
I end up eating bananas,
listening to my arteries harden.
Ben, I'm talking to you as your lawyer.
Your friend. Not a tour guide.
The Cook County grand jury
can't touch you down there.
Look, the boys will take care of you.
They have to.
They've got more skeletons
than most graveyards.
And you know what closets
they're hanging in.
Fields, we didn't build
this organization
by running from grand juries
just to save our hides.
- We stick together.
- That's what I'm saying.
To the boys, you're still number one.
They'll see that you live like a king.
They'll use me as a conduit.
I'll funnel the cash to Switzerland,
launder it in Panama,
and ship it to you
by bank drafts or letters of credit,
whichever you prefer.
That's good. That's good.
You know, Mel,
those bananas will taste
a hell of a lot better
when I know Brannigan's
lying in some gutter.
It's done.
- Who you got?
- Gorman.
We used him before.
Good. He's a pro.
Enough of the walking. Let's ride.
British Airways Flight number BA 570
from Chicago now arriving
at gate number 2.
Is Flight 570 in yet?
Yes, it's just arrived.
Could you make the announcement, then?
Yes.
Have a nice stay.
Thank you.
Would Mr. James Brannigan,
British Airways passenger from Chicago,
please report to the British Airways
information desk.
James Brannigan to British Airways
information desk, please.
How long are you expecting
to be with us, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman?
Oh, sorry. A week.
Business or pleasure, sir?
Strictly pleasure.
Air India Flight number Al620
for Bombay and Tokyo
now boarding at gate number 8.
Lieutenant Brannigan?
Yes. How did you know?
Headquarters told me to look for someone
slightly smaller than the Statue of Liberty.
Detective Sergeant Jennifer Thatcher, sir,
Scotland Yard.
They've made some real improvements
since I was last here.
Thank you. This way, sir.
Where's my man?
The prisoner, Ben Larkin.
Oh, Commander Swann
is handling the extradition.
And the return-ticket reservations?
Sir Charles has taken care of that.
He's expecting you
for lunch at his club, sir.
Sir Charles. Sir Charles.
I've been assigned
as your driver, Lieutenant.
And to generally take care of you
while you're here.
To keep an eye on me, you mean.
Well, not quite. It's more of a PR job.
Anyway, it'll make a nice change
from the Vice Squad.
- Okay, sir.
- Right.
Mel, I'm the one
that's going to take the heat.
Now, nothing can screw up.
Stay cool, Ben.
It's ticking like a Swiss watch.
- Morning, Mr. Larkin.
- Good to see you, Jules.
- Morning, Ben.
- Morning, boys.
Get me a box
at the dog races tonight, Gates.
Oh, yeah. Call Jimmy the Bet.
And tell him to put
£400 on Triple Cross.
Ready when you are, Mr. Larkin.
Good.
You've been to England before, sir?
That's right, Miss Thatcher,
during the war.
Well, I expect you'll find London's
changed quite a bit.
But it's basically the same,
still a very beautiful city.
If there are any places
you'd like to revisit, any pubs or any...
Right now, what I'd like is
about eight hours of sleep,
a shower and a change of clothes.
And to get my hands in Larkin's lapels.
Yes, sir.
I sound like a bear cub
with a toothache, it's just...
I understand, sir.
My father flew with the RAF.
He said there were only three things
wrong with the Yanks.
Yeah?
Overpaid, oversexed and over here.
I really walked into that one.
And deserved it. I'm sorry.
Might we start again, sir.
Why? We're doing fine.
I was just thinking,
can I call you Jenny?
Of course.
Boy, I knew a great gal named Jenny.
She used to lend me money
when I was broke.
Did she contribute
any other philanthropies?
We were friends. Good friends.
Damn good friends.
- Right, Mr. Larkin.
- Hello, hello, hello.
Lie down facing this way.
- All right.
- And relax.
Excuse me, Jackson,
I've got a steam bath out there.
Well, the pool's down there,
but you'll have to go outside.
I'll show you the way.
It's right around the back.
Excuse me, Tom, there's a delivery.
What? I don't know anything
about a delivery.
- Neither do I.
- It's a rush order.
Where should we drop it?
Better put it out there.
Through the open door.
Grand Central Station.
Hey, muscles.
It's a bit tight here.
Can you give us a hand?
Excuse me a moment, Mr. Larkin.
Now, what's all this?
That's great.
You like that, do you?
How do you like that?
Morning, sir.
Here we are, sir. The Garrick Club.
See you later, sir.
Aren't you joining us?
If I walked in there,
I'd cause a dozen heart attacks.
It's a men's club.
Rules strictly enforced.
Too bad.
Sir?
Brannigan. Jim Brannigan
to see Commander Swann.
Yes, sir. That'd be Sir Charles.
He's in the lounge bar upstairs.
Thank you.
Begging your pardon, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brannigan,
it's a club rule.
Fine.
Strictly enforced, I presume.
...and that was the last I saw of her.
Excuse me.
- Lieutenant Brannigan?
- Right.
Charles Swann. Pleasant flight?
Just long.
Would you like a glass of sherry, then?
Well, actually, I'd like a boilermaker.
That's a whiskey neat,
you'd say, and a beer chaser.
- Cold, if you can find it.
- Certainly, sir.
I think we can manage that.
A good old Polish drink.
Now, where do we pick up this Larkin?
Well, he's under surveillance.
Surveillance?
You come to the States for a prisoner,
and we'd have him standing by
handcuffed at the airport.
Yes, but you see,
under our judicial system,
Mr. Larkin has the right
to apply for bail.
Well, unfortunately,
we have the same law.
That's how we lost him.
Rather careless, wasn't it?
I think you can rest assured
that won't happen here.
Spot of lunch?
Why not?
Then we'll pick up your friend Larkin.
Should I call you Sir Charles?
Oh, I think Swann
will do nicely, thank you.
I only use the Sir for theater tickets
and table reservations.
May I lead the way?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Actually, the title
is a military courtesy
granted to one of my ancient ancestors.
Probably for holding somebody's
horse at a coronation.
- How's this?
- Thank you.
No castles or booty?
No, I'm afraid not.
But every Maundy Thursday,
for some totally unaccountable reason,
I'm granted the inestimable privilege...
- Morning, Barker.
- Morning, Sir Charles.
...of dropping a sprig of myrtle
in the River Thames at Westminster.
The Dover sole is excellent.
Thank you very much. Dover sole?
Commander, it's my breakfast time.
I'd sure like two over easy,
some bacon crisp and a short stack.
Right. I think what my guest
would like is
two eggs lightly fried on either side,
a couple of rashers of bacon
and a modest portion of pancakes.
Not too modest on the pancakes.
- Right, sir.
- And Dover sole for me, please.
Thank you, sir.
Lieutenant, you shouldn't be wearing
that particular item.
Well, a fellow at the front desk said
I had to put it on.
Not the tie,
the .38 caliber Colt Diamondback.
Commander, I always wear this.
Well, I'm afraid it's placing you
in violation of
British law
and Scotland Yard regulations.
Well, it isn't in violation
of United States law,
and I work under the Chicago
Police Department regulations,
which makes it obligatory.
Then I strongly urge you to resist
any temptation to use it.
Well, I don't think
I'll be needing it in here.
Excuse me, Sir Charles.
Gentleman to see you at the door.
Excuse me.
Barker.
Bring the Lieutenant a whiskey
and a beer chaser, will you.
You mean a boilermaker, sir.
Make it two.
What for?
Mr. Larkin has been kidnapped.
It can't happen here, huh?
Well, cheer up.
All we can lose is our jobs.
- Oh! Gorman?
- Yeah.
A friend of mine said
you had a package for me.
Two questions. From where and for what?
From Chicago, to hit something.
Right on, bucko.
Half now, and half at ice time.
When he's on ice, you mean.
It's a bit light.
It's just my usual commission.
Off their end. Not mine.
Don't be difficult, friend.
Why don't you stay awhile
and talk to Luana?
Nice and gentle, love, I'm not kinky.
You are what you're paid to be.
This is all that Larkin left behind
at the athletic club.
We don't know that Larkin
was really snatched.
Of course not.
But we do still have
that masseur unconscious in hospital.
That's might be just an act.
At this particular point
I don't think that's
an assumption the Yard
can afford to make.
Well, if it was up to me,
I'd get some men out
thumping on the streets,
passing out some e pluribus unum.
That's what 90% of police work is today.
The murder rate
in your country, I'm sure,
gives ample testimony
to your superior police methods.
Well, Commander, I didn't come over here
to argue police methods.
But a certain Ben Larkin is missing.
And I intend to use
my best efforts to find him.
Without interfering
with the Yard, of course.
Oh, Lieutenant.
I am still a little concerned
about a certain item you're wearing.
Oh, well if that bothers you,
wear it in good health.
The old school tie.
Well, guv, what do you think
of our friend Brannigan?
Well, he's an American.
Sir Charles.
Why would a bona fide lord
want to be a cop?
Because he's good at it.
Why are you a cop?
I don't know. Runs in the family.
But it stops right here.
My son is a lawyer.
Hello, Central? Central 77 here.
Mollie? Do me a favor, will you?
Call Richard and tell him I'll be late.
I don't know. About 7:00. Thanks.
Monkey wrench?
You mean a spanner?
Did I throw one in your social life?
Well, not quite.
Not that Richard is exactly
a paragon of patience.
Well, just blame it
on your Yankee slave driver,
who still hasn't eaten.
Would you mind grabbing a bite
before we go house hunting?
I wouldn't mind at all.
Thank you very much.
Lieutenant, I'll see you in the morning.
- Maybe around nine?
- About that, goodnight.
Mr. Lawyer, the next voice your hear
belongs to Ben Larkin.
You'd better listen.
Fields, I've been grabbed
by a couple of hoods.
They're tough.
So you do exactly what I tell you,
or I'm a dead man.
Now, you've got five envelopes
with this tape.
First, put £50,000 in each envelope.
Get old, used bills.
Then you make the drop in person.
Come alone to the mailbox
in the middle of Piccadilly Circus
at exactly 11:35 a.m. tomorrow morning.
You got that?
Next, stay away
from those damn limey cops.
They could screw things up.
There's a gun at my head, Fields,
so don't blow this one.
Or my guys will tear your heart out.
Why did you double-cross him, Fields?
What does that mean?
Larkin told you to stay away
from the cops.
In Chicago, I would have.
But considering the reputation
of Scotland Yard,
I decided it was
in the best interests of my client
to put the matter in their hands.
You're a real Eagle Scout, Fields.
We don't even know
that that's Larkin's voice.
Inspector, Mr. Larkin called in
to complain about our surveillance, sir.
The call was routed
routinely through Central
where it was in turn re-directed
to the switchboard of our department.
In rather sulfurous language,
I must say,
Mr. Larkin demanded...
Yes, thank you, Mike, thank you.
The point is, we taped Larkin's call,
voiceprinted it.
They matched.
Do you think you can raise
that money by tomorrow morning?
That's no problem.
Fortunately, Mr. Larkin has generous
and influential associates in the States.
Translation, Commander, hoods.
A bank draft is on its way.
Mob money, squeezed out of hookers
and skimmed off of casinos.
Yes, well, I think we perhaps
better get on with it, Mr. Fields.
Commander, what will you be doing?
Well, our interests are mutual.
The safe return of Mr. Larkin.
We'll keep you informed.
It's a bit dicey.
Not a copper in sight.
They're down there, all right.
I can smell them.
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.
Rolls-Royce approaching the circus.
Drop completed.
Prepare for pickup phase.
Well, now we'll see.
Mailman's just passed me.
Approaching the island now.
It's too damn simple.
Pickup completed.
Right, job completed. Let's go.
We'll take it.
It's a messenger on a motor scooter.
We're on him.
Right. Get going!
- Like I said.
- Too damn simple.
That's right. Too damn simple.
Don't get too far behind.
Give Harry a hand, there.
Hold it!
Can you swim?
- Yeah.
- Go get it!
I'll sink with these boots on!
Oy, give us a hand.
After a few questions.
What's the idea of throwing
this money in the river?
Money?
I don't know nothing about no money.
Some bloke mailed the instructions,
with a five-pound note.
Newspaper.
What?
They pulled a Murphy.
Hey, what about me?
A Murphy?
Okay.
Yeah, they tunneled from underneath.
Yes, of course. And then they switched
envelopes by means of...
A false bottom.
As simple as that.
A magnet.
Ruddy sewers.
They'll be miles away by now.
I'll be right back.
Hello, Mrs. Cooper.
Good afternoon, Mr. Brannigan.
Would you like a coffee?
Oh, thank you, no.
Some people are waiting for me.
Oh, pity.
Oh, Mrs. Cooper.
Yes, Mr. Brannigan?
Did I have any visitors today?
No, I don't think so.
Thank you.
Oh, there was a man here.
Something about the central heating.
What happened?
Your central heating friend
left me a present.
- We must call the police.
- He is the police.
I have never seen anything
like it in my life.
- You're insured?
- Oh, yes, I am.
- Jim?
- In here.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm afraid that the...
I'll show you.
You mean he's put another one in there?
I mean...
- That's what I mean.
- Yes.
Yeah.
Larkin paid 25 grand
to get me that view.
- All the usual checks being made?
- Yes, sir.
All been fingerprinted, guv.
I want a complete report
on all sales of gelignite
- during the past two months.
- Right, guv.
And try and trace that damn thing.
- Where is he?
- He's downstairs at Mrs. Cooper's, sir.
Oh, don't you look nice.
Well, thank you.
I'm sorry I haven't a room available,
but I'm sure I could make room
for you in my place.
Oh, that's very kind of you, but...
- No, really, it'd be a pleasure.
- Lieutenant.
Jennifer, don't you think we ought to show
our visitor a bit of British hospitality?
Why don't you take him out
for a spot of dinner?
Yes, sir.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
And leave the police work to the Yard.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Cooper.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Cooper, thank you.
Enjoy yourself, Lieutenant.
I will.
Perhaps you'd care
for a cup of coffee. Come along.
Well.
It says For Sale.
Well, I'm sure I can persuade them
to rent it to you for a week.
If you don't mind me as a neighbor.
Why should I?
It puts me closer to my driver.
It's been a lovely evening, Jim.
Yeah, pleasant.
And I hate to change the mood.
But, Jenny, I want you to do me a favor.
You shouldn't have that, Jim.
That's a felony.
- Is that so?
- Yes, that is so.
Commander Swann was not amused.
I had all these names run down
by the Department.
They all check out except that one.
- Jimmy the Bet.
- That's right, do you know him?
Yeah, he's a bookie. He's also a grass.
What you would call a stoolie.
He's got his eye on every keyhole in London.
Is it important?
Anything that has to do
with Larkin is important.
He's in blackmail, extortion, hard drugs.
You name it, he's in it.
Jenny, I just happen to be working
the other side of the street.
Is that all?
Well, a couple of years ago,
I was making it tough for him.
And one night he hit back.
Pair of shotguns.
But he obviously missed.
But the rookie riding with me
took a blast in his face.
He left a widow
and a couple of nice kids.
I'm sorry, Jim.
You must have been close to him.
Oh, it'd make a good story,
but that's not the reason.
The truth is, I hated his guts.
He didn't like me.
He had a degree in criminology and...
Well, to hell with that.
My job was to keep him alive
until he could
get smart enough or tough enough
to take care of himself.
I blew it.
What's that for?
I don't know.
You're just so damn solid.
Fat, you mean.
- Telephone for you, sir.
- Thank you.
Hello?
Yes, Inspector. Yes, right away.
He wants us back at the office.
Yes, well, there's no doubt
this fingerprint is Larkin's.
Oh, forgive me for interrupting
your evening, Lieutenant.
Jenny, the artist has a sketch
of our mad bomber up in 194.
- Pick it up for me, will you?
- Yes, sir.
Your theory that Mr. Larkin
may have staged his own kidnapping
doesn't quite work.
Is that so?
Someone sent us
a personal contribution from Mr. Larkin.
Did you print it?
Of course.
Third finger of the left hand.
And it was accompanied by a demand
for an additional 350,000 quid.
That brings the ante up to
a million and a half dollars.
The additional payment
was in the nature of a penalty
because Mr. Fields consulted
the Yard for assistance.
- These gentlemen play rough.
- And smart.
They certainly made bloody fools of us
in that Piccadilly caper.
All my years in the Yard, I've never
received a finger in the morning post.
God knows what they'll be
sending us next. On, thanks.
Well, that's it.
It's only based on your landlady's
description, of course.
But we've wired copies to Interpol,
the Sûreté and the FBI.
Does it ring a bell for you?
No, but if Larkin has a contract on me,
he'd hire top talent.
Then I want you
on the next flight to Chicago.
You care, Commander, you really care.
I want you in Chicago alive,
you big sod.
I don't want you in London
as an unsolved homicide.
We're short-staffed as it is.
We have the same problem
in Chicago, Commander.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Oh, Lieutenant.
I'll take that particular item.
You mean the...
The notepad.
I guess I picked this up by mistake.
Of course. That's what I assumed.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.
Listen, darling, I've got a problem.
I've got to stay on duty till 2:00.
Well, here comes my problem.
Oh, Jim, this is my fiancé,
Richard Nelson.
- Jim Brannigan.
- Oh, how are you?
So, you're the guy
who's been ruining our love life.
I'm glad you're not 20 years younger.
If I were, you'd have to worry.
Well, we're not finished yet.
One more call. Sorry.
- Goodnight, love.
- Goodnight.
Okay, where to?
Jimmy the Bet.
Oh, you watch him.
He's a tough customer.
- Evening, Jimmy.
- I've got no time for bird cops.
I got £1,000 on this fight.
Jimmy, it isn't social, it's official.
Open up.
It still isn't social. I'm a cop.
It shows, flatfoot.
And I found your name on a notepad
of Benny Larkin's.
Is he one of your customers?
I got nothing to say to you. Out!
Benny Larkin's been kidnapped.
You're gonna give me some information.
I can ask questions easy,
or I can ask them hard.
Which will it be?
This is what I answer questions with.
It's mighty persuasive.
I guess the questions can wait.
But not for long.
Now, would you like to try
for England's free dental care,
or are you gonna answer my questions?
I'll ask you just once.
- Name a name.
- Al Drexel.
- Did you hear another?
- No, I swear it.
Where can I find this Drexel?
A pub, he goes there, the Lamb Tavern.
He goes there midday.
Well, thanks, Jimmy.
You know something,
that Jackson's a bum.
He won't make it through the eighth.
Any trouble?
No trouble. Little hard
to understand his accent.
That's Scotch rump steak, sir.
Right, well, I'll have that one, please.
I don't mind this turning
into a shopping tour
as long as it ends up with Drexel.
I say. Talk of the devil.
That's him in the gray suit,
walking towards the pub now.
Fine, would you just give me time
to get a little friendly.
Mind if I butt in, partner?
It's a free country.
- All right, Navy?
- Yes, sure.
Yeah, it's a pleasant country.
I wouldn't argue with that.
Last time I was here, people were
getting bombed a different way.
Doris, let's have some service here.
The man's dying of thirst.
All right, darling, what do you want?
Well, I want some Guinness.
How about you?
- Same again, please.
- Good.
- Navy?
- No, I've got enough, thanks.
How is the second-best Navy?
- You should know.
- Nice one, Ted.
Well, partner. Cheers.
Wait a minute, friend,
we're having a drink.
Drexel, I'd like a few words with you.
Let's step outside, shall we?
Scotland Yard. Can't you smell it?
Is it illegal to have a drink?
May I suggest, sir,
that you keep out of this.
This is strictly police business.
Oh, tell him to show you his badge.
Drexel, I said outside. Now come on.
That cuts it!
Sorry.
Hey, what are you doing?
What's the idea?
Well, who the hell started it?
Awfully sorry.
And I love you so
Let the sun shine
Let the sunshine in
Let the sun shine
Let the sunshine in
Guv.
Guv!
Mike, have you got it?
Seems likely, guv.
Gwendolyn Rooke.
Female, Caucasian, aged 26.
Well, get on with it then.
The subject resides in Balham.
I'm sorry, lady. If I were you, I'd...
Look out!
And has access to blueprints and charts
for telephone and sewage conduits...
...under Piccadilly Circus.
This place is getting kinda unfriendly.
- You're right.
- Where are we going?
Let's go to my place and have a drink.
You all right?
Come on, partner.
We'd better get out of here.
The Yank's got our pigeon.
As far as I can see.
Yes, well, perhaps
we'd better look her over.
See what Miss Rooke
has to say for herself.
Oh, and, Mike, while you're at it,
run this lot of rowdies in, will you.
Right, guv.
Excuse me. How's your wrist?
Constable. Arrest that lot, will you.
Come on, sir. Come on.
It had nothing to do with me.
I'm only here for the beer.
I think you'll find the evidence
is conclusive, sir,
if you would just examine the map.
Yes, of course. Thank you.
Thanks, Mike.
Last month,
the 16th, to be exact,
you made copies of maps
detailing the electrical and sewage conduits
beneath Piccadilly Circus.
That's what I'm paid to do, sir.
Of course.
But to whom did you give those copies?
To one of my supervisors, I expect.
Miss Rooke, both you and I know
that that is not true.
Protecting a criminal, Miss Rooke,
is a crime in itself.
And I suggest that in your own
best interests you stop lying to me.
It's okay. It's okay.
Don't upset yourself.
Miss Rooke.
I've always been a good girl, sir.
I'm sure you have, my dear.
But to whom did you give them?
To my boyfriend, Freddy.
Freddy.
Now, now, come on.
Watch it, partner.
- I'm only just...
- You're a handful.
I like Americans. They think big.
Wait till you see what I've got here.
Take a look at this.
Look at what?
I've got a deal going here
that'll make your hair stand on end.
Oh, no, you're getting too familiar.
I've only just met you.
We're only acquaintances yet.
Well, you know what I think
you need, fella, is a cup of coffee.
- I need another drink.
- Come on.
- I can't stand coffee.
- Get in the kitchen.
Come on, let's have a fight, Marquis
of Queensberry rules. Let's have a drink.
Give me a minute
and I'll fix you right up,
- if I can find the coffee.
- I don't want any coffee.
Maybe you'll have to settle for tea.
All right, Buster,
the friendly hour's over. Wake up.
Come on, get up.
Hold it up, down there!
Get off, you stupid-looking mutt.
Sorry!
Police, son. Follow that car.
What? Police? What car?
- Right-hand drive.
- Of course.
Well...
I say...
This is actually a new car, you know.
It's not really supposed
to go beyond 4,000 revs.
Till the 1,000-mile inspection.
Please look out!
I was rather hoping to keep it
for a year or so, I...
I wonder if I might get you
a taxi or something.
Hang on.
- I feel sick.
- Not in here!
Oh, nuts!
Oh, no!
I waited a year for delivery.
Very good. Thank you.
Well, Lieutenant, how did you enjoy
your sightseeing tour?
The view from the bridge was terrific.
Incidentally, regarding that automobile,
where would you liked it shipped?
Well, you bought it, you know.
Ooh, handsome.
Freddy!
- Yes, Mike?
- Nothing, guv.
It's not fair. My eyes are murdering me,
looking at all those bloody pictures.
You'll smoke when I tell you.
Listen, I know my rights.
You start talking to me about rights,
and I'll tear you limb from limb.
Now, who did you sell those plans to?
I don't know what the bloody hell
you're talking about, man.
Poor, ignorant, wee laddie, isn't he?
They do have libraries inside, Freddy,
and I'll put you away for so long,
you'll come out a bloody PhD!
Swann.
I'd tell that fellow
what he wants to know.
He likes to hurt people.
Today at a bar, there was a fight.
He bit a fellow's ear off.
Him?
And that's not all.
What, him?
We'll be in touch. No more calls.
Look, I've really had you, you creep.
Okay.
Okay.
He gave me £100 to sell him the plans.
- Who did?
- Charlie.
Charlie Kane.
Put him up.
That's him. That's Charlie.
- Take him away.
- All right, come on.
And that's our man,
that's the fellow that nailed Drexel.
- Are you sure?
- I saw him.
Boy, oh boy,
it's really coming together.
That was Fields. His friends
are calling at 11:00 tomorrow
with instructions for the next payment.
Give us time
to put a tracer on the call?
I wish we could.
They're calling on a marine frequency.
They ain't amateurs.
Hello, Jim. Where are you going?
Have you got the keys to your car?
I forgot my notebook.
Sure, I'll get it.
No, you'll get your hair wet.
You wanna bet?
Jenny, look out!
Jenny! You all right?
Are you all right?
- No.
- What's the matter?
Well, look at my hat.
Oh, your hat.
Let's get out of this.
Yes, sir.
Damn it, I'm having to take more flak
than an air gunner over Normandy
on this case. Forget the Commissioner.
Now, we've got the Home Secretary
blowing his top, demanding to know
what kind of a lunatic I've turned loose.
This isn't Chicago, you know, Brannigan.
That's right, Commander.
You can't buy a decent hamburger
anyplace around here.
You're a bloody magnet for trouble.
First the man hired to kill you
blows up an apartment,
and then you demolish an automobile
in what must be one of the most
brazen, reckless stunts
in the annals of this city.
Look, Commander...
And then, last night,
you turn a perfectly peaceful
London street into a shooting gallery.
And if I hadn't done some shooting,
Jenny would be lying
on a marble slab right now.
Exactly. Simply because she
was mistaken for you.
I've asked you politely.
Now I'll ask you impolitely,
give me that gun.
I haven't got it.
Well?
This just arrived
from the FBI in Washington, DC, guv.
You got a name for him?
Name of John Gorman.
An habitué of New Orleans, Louisiana.
- Last known address...
- Do you know him?
Well, I know about him.
The word is that he's a stud
who won't quit.
Well, we'll pick him up. Send out
a top-priority signal to all stations.
Right away, sir.
Yes?
Joseph Brannigan, long distance.
Hello?
Hello, big stuff. Sure, fine.
You did?
Well, what's the dope?
Well, now let me get this straight, now.
Jupiter Equity Fund.
He bought 20,000 shares at $49,
sold them at $3.
That makes Melvin a living,
breathing pauper.
Sure, I will. Be home soon.
Your son?
What's his line of work?
Ballet.
I should have guessed.
No, he's Assistant
District Attorney for Cook County.
Anything in that conversation
I should know about?
Commander, I wish it were Christmas.
Have I got some
kind of a present for you.
Yes. Right, thank you.
Mr. Fields is on his way up, sir.
Do you know where he's parked?
- Nine, lower level.
- Right.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Got to the bank at the stroke of 10:00,
and it took eight clerks
until now to get this package together.
We were worried about you, Melvin.
Make yourself right at home, Brannigan.
I have.
We're now ready and willing
to make the payment.
Mr. Fields,
we have some new information.
And we are now very close to a breakthrough
in this case. Very close.
Within four hours, or five, at the most,
we expect to have Mr. Larkin home safe.
I strongly suggest, therefore, that,
in the best interests of your client,
you delay payment for those few hours.
No way.
This time I do exactly
what they tell me.
You pay that money now,
and you'll get Larkin back in chunks.
The Lieutenant quotes chapter
and verse, Mr. Fields.
This is a gentleman who rejoices
in the name of Charlie the Handle.
Identified as a member
of the kidnap team.
He will lead us to Mr. Larkin.
Kind of unusual, Melvin.
Couple of professional cops telling you
what's best for your client.
Knock it off, Brannigan.
If Larkin's friends in the States
find out I'm in bed with the Yard,
they'll part my hair with a blowtorch.
It's all there,
you don't have to count it.
Well, if you lose Larkin and that loot,
they'll part more than your hair
with that blowtorch.
Earthy, but accurate, I would have thought.
If you'll accept my apologies,
Mr. Fields, I really must insist
that you give us the time.
Something's coming in, sir.
Put it on the speaker.
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Now you contact us
on marine frequency 15.2. Repeat, 15.2.
We will use different frequencies
to contact you,
and you will have only four seconds
to make the change.
Calling Mel Fields.
Calling Mel Fields on 17.35.
Are you there, Fields?
This is Mel Fields.
Now, I'm going to give it to you
just once, so get it good.
This is how you make the drop.
You leave the hotel
in exactly 10 minutes.
And make sure you come alone.
Have you got that, Fields?
Yes, I've got it.
But I've run into a slight snag.
What's the problem?
There's no problem.
But the bank needs four or five hours
more to get the money together.
What do you think, Geef? Coppers?
For his sake, I hope not.
Listen, Fields...
Come on, Mel.
Bring the money here. Bring it!
All right. You've just
bought yourself four hours.
And then you've had it.
Then you've had it.
All right.
You've got four hours
to get Larkin back.
But if you don't, I make the payment.
And I won't tell you where or when.
Fair enough.
And, Commander Swann,
I want your word that there'll be
no surveillance of any kind.
You have my word, sir.
Oh, and be sure to call room service
if you need anything.
I will.
Find anything?
She's clean, sir. Except for this.
Long-range homing device.
You can't trust anybody these days.
Stay back, not too close.
It's okay. He's alone.
Well, come on, make the payoff
and let's get the hell out of here.
Not yet, Ben.
What do you mean, not yet?
Charlie. Geef.
- You're early, Fields.
- Yeah.
Has he been a good boy?
He never raised a finger.
Oh, bad joke, Geef.
Good job, Charlie.
Well, come on, get them off!
Get back,
on your big fat... rear.
Well.
What's going on?
You know, I think it's about time.
Yes.
But this is my party, Charlie.
Ben,
the first time we met,
you told me something
I've never forgotten.
It's my golden rule, you might say.
Never trust anybody.
Mel, have you gone out of your...
We pulled it off, Ben. We did it!
Oh, I'm sorry about your finger, Ben.
I'm really sorry.
I bet you are, yeah.
For a million bucks, it was worth it.
And don't forget the first payment
I've got stashed away.
How do I get this thing off?
The key's over by the mirror.
It's first class for you
all the way to South America
and on into the sunset.
And this makes up for that bath
I took in that Jupiter stock.
Yeah, sorry about that.
We got wall-to-wall alibis.
Oh, Scotland Yard will swear
that I cooperated.
I made the payments.
And even that big clown Brannigan
backs up our story.
As long as he's alive.
You know, Mel, for a minute,
when you had that gun on me,
I thought you were gonna get greedy.
You know, for a minute, Ben,
I was tempted.
But what the hell kind of world would it be
if you couldn't trust somebody?
We've been had.
Knock knock.
Brannigan!
I wouldn't.
Unless you wanna sing soprano.
Earthy, but I agree with my friend.
They're all yours, Lieutenant.
Don't worry about me, James.
Bye-bye.
And I mean bye-bye.
That fella don't quit easy, does he?
Well, do you think
you can hang on to them
until I can get them
a couple of airplane tickets?
Oh, I think we can manage that, yes.
I just hope you don't lose them
back in the Colonies.
Safe trip.
Thank you.
How about a lift, Yank?
Jim!
Jim! Jim!
I'm all right.
Over here!
Now!
Get behind that car!
Well, I'm going to miss this old town.
It's going to miss you.
I'm not sure if I agree with what
my old dad said about you Yanks.
You mean that part
about us being overpaid?
No, over here.
Jenny, it's been great.
It has.
So long.
