- How many is that now?
- You need to call him a taxi.
I'm not trying to be mean.
- It's that old guy again.
- Should you let
the manager know?
- The guy hasn't done anything.
- That's how it is with creeps,
right up until the day that
they decide to do something.
- He's probably harmless.
- Nobody's harmless,
especially a male nobody.
- Excuse me. Can I sit down?
- You're allowed to sit
wherever you'd like.
- Thank you.
- What would you like to drink?
- A soda water... with lemon.
Please cut it in half.
- That's $1.
- Thank you.
Here.
- Have anything
smaller than that?
- All my bills are that size.
- I'll get you your change.
- During my prior visits
to this establishment,
you were tending the bar. Do
you really enjoy that work?
- When the customers
are respectful, I do.
- Mm.
- But, uh...
you have ambitions, don't you?
- That's not any
of your business.
- Perhaps I'm mistaken...
I am from Europe and do not know
all of these local customs...
But I thought that the primary
responsibility of a bartender
is to serve and engage the
customers in a conversation.
Is companionship something
that you offer?
- Make one more insinuation,
and I'll have you thrown out.
- Cheers.
- So, where are you
from in Europe?
- I am from France.
My father is French, and
my mother is German.
But I lived in many places.
- Well, I don't know how
things are back there,
but in this country,
people don't wear hats
when they sit down
someplace to have a drink.
So, you want me to
take my hat off?
- I'm letting you
know the customs,
since you're such
a respectful guy.
- Tell me something.
Are you an acquaintance of hers?
- Bartender? The man here wants
to know if we're acquainted.
- Disgusting homosexuals.
Ugh!
- Mind if I turn it down a bit?
- Too loud?
- No. I just want to
talk about something.
- What's on your mind?
- Well... what we
talked about last week.
- Having a baby?
- Yeah.
I think...
I think now would be
the perfect time.
- Me too.
Did you hear that?
- It came from the back.
- Aaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaaah!
Ahh. Ahh. Ahh.
Ahh.
- Harrow, come take
a look at this.
- Maybe like a-a raccoon,
when it stands on its hind
legs, begging for scraps?
I'll call it in.
- Get ready for
something different.
Freeze!
- Hello, Dad.
- You letting yourself go?
- What?
- That stain on your face.
- Oh. I'm, um...
working on a beard.
Thought I'd try a new look.
- Well, you might want to remove
some of that jewelry you got on.
It's dated.
- Oh.
I do not remember
putting that on.
- Eddy!
- Mom.
- Oh! How are you?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- That's good.
- Yeah.
- You look well.
- Don't patronize him.
- I'm not. Divorce can be
very hard to go through,
and I think you look very well,
especially when you consider...
I cleaned up your old room.
Any idea how long
you intend to stay?
- Uh, well, I'm gonna
look for apartments
when I'm off work this weekend,
so I don't think very long.
- I'd like that in writing.
- Oh, you are a delight.
- Are you feeling sorry for
yourself, coming in here,
going through his
stuff, wallowing?
- Dad, if you don't want
me here, just say so,
but Mom invited me, okay?
You've been at your
worst since I got here,
and, also, your best is...
not great, so...
- Yeah, your lecture would
have had a lot more impact
if you weren't holding
a doll in your hands.
- You know what? I can... I can
just go stay at Markowitz's...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your mom wants you
here, it's fine by me.
- Okay.
- Any of that stuff valuable?
That box has just been sitting
in that closet forever.
Well, you wanna sell it on
the computer, keep the cash.
- No. I don't think I'd
sell any of this stuff, no.
- All right. Up to you.
Home by 7:00, you can
have dinner with us.
If not, we'll set
something aside for you.
- Thanks.
- You know, I was disappointed
when I found out you and
Jennifer separated.
I really thought she'd
make a good mother.
And she was a real
good looker, too...
especially for a guy who...
works in a comic-book
store and draws.
- I'm sure that was
supposed to come out nicer.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
That'll be $12.
- I've got $9.85. Can
you do some type...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
No charity, okay?
If you don't have enough, you
can steal from your mommy
like everybody else.
- You're a jerk-off.
- Perhaps I am, yes,
but that does not diminish the
value of my advice to you.
- You want me to
hold these back here
or put them back on the shelves?
- You can hold them.
You drawing anything
new these days?
- Hmm? No, not really.
- You should do more
Madame Lightning.
- Mm, maybe.
- She's hot.
- I think you should
work on something new.
- Yeah, I will. I just, um...
I've been very, uh...
- Distracted.
You've been pretty distracted.
- Oh, yeah, I have been.
- Eddy Easton?
- Yeah?
- Do you remember me?
I'm Ashley... Ashley Summers.
- Oh, my God. Mike's
little sister.
- Yeah. You remember.
- Oh. Wow.
- I know I looked kind of
different before, but...
- Are you still over there?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
But it's just me now.
Mike's in the Coast Guard. I
don't know if he told you.
And my parents moved
to Florida, so...
- Oh.
- Oh, sorry.
Am I interrupting you? I...
- Oh, no, I was... No, this...
I was looking at the old thing
'cause, um, honestly,
work was bad,
and the idea of having dinner
with my parents
right now is, uh...
- You wanna join us for a
walk around the block?
- Oh.
You're walking a cat.
- Hypothetically. Yeah.
- So, what are you doing now?
- I'm getting a sociology degree
and working at a record shop.
- Oh, cool. I love records.
I mean, when they first came
out, we called them "records,"
before they were "vinyl,"
when hipster douchebags
just made them to
seem all retro.
- Yeah. But, honestly,
I'd probably agree
with any statement
that contained the phrase
"hipster douchebags."
Sorry. - Oh. So...
will Rhonda get jealous if
I ask you for your number?
- Yes.
- Okay.
- But she can deal.
- Hello.
Do you want to go to
the auction, hmm?
Shit!
Jesus. Ow.
Ow. Mnh.
Ow.
Fuck.
Shit.
Well, you definitely seem like a
toy that a maniac would make.
Don't stab or hook anything.
- Do you guys remember where
you got that puppet for James,
the, um, creepy one
with the, uh...
The skull face and the hat?
- I don't. Do you?
- We didn't actually
buy that for James.
He found it when he was
at sleepaway camp.
I would never have bought
him something like that.
He really wanted to
keep it, so we let him.
- Where was his sleepaway camp?
- Postville.
- You know, this used to be
better before he could fly...
- Uh-huh.
- Back when he leapt over stuff.
- Why?
- Because jumping
hundreds of feet in the air
is a logical extrapolation
of superhuman strength, right?
Whereas flying displays
a flagrant disregard
for the laws of physics, okay?
Unless his body was somehow
magnetically opposed
to the Earth
or somehow magnetically
attracted to the sun,
which is ridiculous.
He's just too powerful
if he can fly.
- Yeah, but... But
he's also bulletproof.
So, what's the difference?
- He's bullet-resistant.
- Hey!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Mmm.
- You must be Ashley.
- I am. And you're Markowitz?
- Are you impressed?
- Just don't even...
Don't even engage him.
That's the best thing to do.
Just... - Okay.
- Yeah, just look
over here, so...
- What's this? You
going somewhere?
- Um, I was actually thinking
about going to that convention
at the end of the month.
- Cool.
- Oh, my God. Do you wanna go?
- Mm, to a convention celebrating
a bunch of sick murders
that happened 30 years ago?
Things like that exemplify
absolutely everything that's
wrong with our society.
- So, that's a yes?
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool. Okay. I
figured you'd want to.
- You okay there?
- Don't look at him.
- I'm sorry. I just...
I get this really weird cough
when I'm not invited to things.
It's a... - You wanna come
to the convention? - No.
- Oh, my God, I would love
to join you two. Thank you.
- That was not an official
invitation, okay?
- You gonna un-invite me?
- Mm-hmm.
- Your very close friend
and tolerant employer?
- Okay, if you're gonna come,
just a couple rules. Ready?
There's no eating in the car.
There's no drinking in the car.
There's no smoking in the car.
There's no black
metal in the car,
no thrash metal, no death metal.
- What about...
- No grindcore.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- And you're paying for gas.
- Hold on a second,
Genghis McHitler.
You're gonna make me
follow all these rules
and then also pay for gas?
These are my terms. They
are non-negotiable.
Do you still want to come?
- Yes, I do, although now it's
mostly just to spite you.
- That's fine.
Hey, Ashley, do you
know any another 7 1/2s
that you could maybe...
I mean, I would go
as low as, like, a 7
or a very skilled 6 1/2.
- This is grindcore.
You heard about it
your whole life.
This is it.
- Very good. Carry on, driver.
- It was your brother's, right...
The puppet?
- Yeah, he, uh... he found
it at sleepaway camp
the summer before his, uh...
accident.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up anything sad.
I-I... - No, no.
Look, we're... we're selling
one of James's toys.
It's bound to come up.
- You know, grindcore would
help us avoid this topic.
Also, uh... I don't know...
toplessness?
- But you're only an A-cup.
Maybe a B.
- Might you try being polite to
you boyfriend's boss, Sugarbat?
- Hey.
No nicknames for Blondie here.
Okay?
- Fine, Mussolini.
- You wanna...
- Nice.
- Enjoy your stay.
Hi. Welcome to the Brass Buckle.
You here for the convention?
- Yes, we are. Yeah.
- Oh, perfect.
Uh, what names are your
reservations under?
- Uh, there's two. One's
under, uh, Easton.
One's under Markowitz.
- You must be Markowitz.
- Why? 'Cause I look like a Jew?
- Are you Markowitz?
- Yes.
- Then there's nothing to be
upset about, now, is there?
All right, here's this.
Please, if you could just...
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.
- Sign right here.
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.
Right there. Thank you. - Okay.
- There's one key,
and your second key.
- Okay.
- You're all checked in...
102 and the other one.
Um, I'm Howie, if
you need anything.
And these pamphlets right here
have the entire convention
schedule on them.
Also, there's a coupon to
the Toulon Mansion Tour,
if you'd like to go.
There's one more today at 5:30.
- Thanks, Howie.
- Thank you. Enjoy your stay.
- It's good.
- Yeah.
Let's do this. - Okay.
Wait. Aren't we meeting
Markowitz in like 10 minutes?
- We'll do it twice, then.
- Mmm.
Aah. Twice?
- Mmm.
- Mmm.
Mmm. Not bad for a
comic-book guy.
- Remind me your name.
- You're an idiot.
I wasn't able to
find you a 7 1/2...
- Oh.
- Or a skilled 6.
But, uh, I appreciate you
sharing Edgar with me.
- I'm happy to.
- Thanks.
- Who knows? I might
be able to pick up
a rural 7 1/2 in the hotel bar.
It is very depressing in there.
It might give me the edge.
Hey, have you, um... you checked
out Madame Lightningyet...
You know, the comic Edgar did?
- No. I mean, not yet. Of
course, I will, but, uh...
- You should. It's really good.
- Yeah.
Yeah. I'm sure it's great.
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's get started, shall we?
My name is Carol Doreski,
and I'll be your tour
guide this evening.
I'm a retired police officer
who was part of the team
that raided this
mansion 30 years ago.
Yes, I was one of the shooters.
Andre Toulon... Note
the pronunciation...
Was born in Paris,
France, in 1907.
Not much is known about
his life in Europe,
though from a very early age,
he was involved with
the family business.
That was manufacturing, selling,
and performing with puppets.
We had three of his puppets in
that display case over there...
before they got stolen.
And this is one of only
two surviving photographs
of Les Fantoches
Magiques de Toulon.
Translated, that means
"The Magical French
Puppets of Toulon."
Now, Andre Toulon was
imprisoned in Paris
for three years
in the late 1920s
and twice for shorter durations
in Norway and Luxembourg.
After his third incarceration,
Toulon moved to Germany,
where he remained until
shortly after the war.
- Somebody fled toGermany?
- During his time
in the Fatherland,
Toulon resumed his puppet show.
Blueprints for this
mansion and bars of gold
were sent from Germany to
the Unites States by Toulon
as World War II turned
in favor of the Allies.
Four weeks after Germany
surrendered, Toulon,
along with his wife, Madeline,
boarded an ocean liner bound
for the United States.
It was during this journey that Mrs.
Toulon
jumped from the ship
and committed suicide.
- The walls of this
chamber are soundproof.
On the day that the police
entered the premises,
these four cots were
occupied by women.
Three of them were alive,
but in terrible shape.
Their...
eyes had been gouged out,
and their bodies were covered
with burns and lacerations.
All of them were insane.
And the two who were
eventually identified...
were both Jewish.
Note the holes in the
middle of the mattresses
and the drain on the
floor below them.
It appears the war did not end
in Germany for Andre Toulon.
The swastika in the center is
more than eight feet tall.
- Actually, when I
grew up in Germany,
we never said "swastika."
We said "Hakenkreuz."
- You have anything
else you wanna add,
since you're the expert?
Is that a... "nein"?
Follow me downstairs.
This is a partial collection
of Andre Toulon's
extensive library.
In total, the library
has volumes on biology,
astrology, numerology,
eschatology, and demonology,
among other more
esoteric subjects.
These were written in
38 different languages,
not including the papyrus scrolls
in that case over there,
which are in two languages
yet to be identified.
Yes, we checked the Internet.
Now, I'd like you to
pay close attention
to the volumes prominently
displayed in the case.
These are from the private
library of Adolf Eichmann.
Eichmann is credited with
organizing the "Final Solution."
- It sounds like Toulon deserved
worse than what he got.
- You're quite right, my friend.
This cellar workshop
is where Andre Toulon
manufactured puppets
for his mail-order business.
It is unclear how many of
these puppets were made
and sent around the
United States,
Europe, and Asia,
though 60 or so of them are
expected be in Postville
by tomorrow for the auction.
This room...
is where we found
Andre Toulon...
on the day that we
forced our way inside.
Toulon...
raised his gun,
which was a Luger.
And we shot him...
four times.
He fell to the ground
and died without...
taking a single shot.
I've often wondered... Maybe
he wanted to be executed.
At least, I hope so.
Andre Toulon's body was
claimed by a distant relative
and laid to rest
in that mausoleum.
- What are the rods coming
out of the... the top?
- Oh, uh, no one's really sure.
Speculation is that it has some
sort of occult significance.
His library was
full of that stuff.
- Because they don't
go with the rest
of the architecture, you know?
- No, I guess they don't.
Well, this is the
end of the tour.
Feel free to look around
for a few more minutes
and ask me any
additional questions.
- Cool. Thank you.
You guys need a jump?
- Thanks, but I
already tried that.
I'm not sure what could
be wrong with it.
- Good luck.
- Hey, there's one right there.
Right there.
- Oh. Hi.
- Sorry. We probably
knocked it over
when we were rushing earlier.
Think somebody who
works here took him?
- I think that a lot of
very valuable collectibles
all arrived in a small
town at the same time
and I was a fucking moron
to trust a hotel lock.
- Hello?
- Yeah. Hi. Hi.
This is Edgar Easton,
and I'm in 336. Um...
- Rester dans l'ombre.
- Yes?
- Hello? Hello?
- H-Hello?
- Hello, sir?
- Hello. Hi...
Yes, yes, this is Edgar Easton.
Sorry.
There was some
interference on the line.
Yeah, I'm... I'm in 336.
Something of mine
is, uh, stolen.
- Okay. I'll... I'll...
I'll see what I can do.
- Okay.
- Did that voice say,
"Rester dans l'ombre"?
- I think so, yes.
Why? What does that mean?
- It's French. It means,
"Remain in the shadows."
- Something just
went under the bed.
- Like what? A cockroach?
A mouse?
- Bigger.
Jason. - Yeah?
- Our Kaiser's gone.
You know where it is?
- Yeah. Hold on a sec.
He's down here.
- How'd he get over there?
- I don't know.
Housekeepers, I guess.
- Well, after what we saw
today in the Toulon Mansion,
I wouldn't have minded
if it got stolen.
Having something like that
makes me really uncomfortable.
- Lots of Jewish people collect
Nazi memorabilia... medals,
pamphlets, posters,
stuff like that.
My Uncle Shelley does.
Where'd this guy go?
Huh.
- Is it to remind him of
what happened back then?
- It's a reminder, sure,
but there's also a feeling of
empowerment there, you know?
Like saying to the Nazis,
"Your big plans of genocide
and world domination"
didn't work,
and now your symbols are nothing
more than trinkets for us
to collect,
"souvenirs of your failure
and our survival."
- Aaaaaaaaaah!
- Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!
- Hang it up in the closet.
- There.
You ever worked at a strip club?
- No.
- Hmm.
You could.
- And that's supposed
to be a compliment?
- I bet you don't
have any tan lines.
I was right.
Aaaah! Aaaah! - Fuck!
- Ohhh!
- What the fuck are you doing?!
- Fuck! What the fuck?!
- Shit.
- Ahh! What the fuck?
- Ohh!
David Starr starts in Toronto
with the superkick to the face.
- Oh! What elevation on that...
- Kill the bastard
son of a bitch!
- Nearly jumped out
of the building!
This is lucha libre rules...
- Total bullshit, man!
- Although not spent a
lot of time in Mexico,
maybe not super familiar
with lucha libre rules.
- David Starr not
endearing himself
to this wrestling crowd.
- Another beer?
- Bartender?
- What do you want
from the Cuddly Bear?
- I want to buy that woman a drink.
What's she having?
- Tea.
Need a moment to figure
your strategy, cuz?
- I'd like to have a tea bag
of whatever she's having.
This will just take
a few seconds.
- No rush.
- Okay.
I would like you to deliver
this tea bag to the bookish
blonde over there.
- Cuddly Bear can do that.
From the tall
gentleman at the end.
Want another martini?
- Yeah. Uh, and I think I
might order some food, too.
- All right. Nerissa,
wants to order.
- How much would
it cost me to, uh,
drop a laxative in the
bookish blonde's drink?
-$750.
- That is a very high
and specific price.
- Cuddly Bear don't wanna
hurt nobody, even a hater,
but Mrs. Cuddly Bear wants
herself a new hi-def TV.
Cuddly Bear's got principles,
but he also got priorities.
- Markowitz.
- Cuddly Bear.
- Yeah. I heard. Hey,
have a drink on me.
- Thanks, cuz.
- I'll be right back
for your order.
- Thank you. Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.
Is that an Empress Asayuki
pin you're wearing?
- You know Empress Asayuki?
- I have every manga and DVD.
- Well, good to know.
I'll be back very soon.
- Postville P.D.
Edgar Easton?
You're the one that reported
your doll missing, correct?
- I did. And it's a puppet.
- Is she with you?
- Yes, she is.
- Name?
- Ashley Summers.
- Your girlfriend?
- Uh...
we're dating. Right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Did she know about the
doll, what it was worth?
- She did.
Uh, I-I don't understand what
that has to do with anything.
- When did you first
tell her about the doll?
- I don't understand what
that has to do with anything.
- You don't have to understand.
Just tell me...
When did you first tell
her about the doll?
- I don't know. A little
over a week ago, maybe.
- Was that before or after you
two first had intercourse?
- None of your business.
- No, it's my business because...
- Edgar told me about the puppet
exactly one week after we'd had
intercourse for the first time.
We did it 3 more times that day
and approximately
11 more times the
following week.
Need any other stats, Gramps?
- No, you told me
more than plenty.
Now, when did you first
notice your doll missing?
- Please don't say, "Doll."
And if you saw it, I swear
you would never say "doll."
- It's a doll. It's a doll.
Ma'am?
Ma'am, Postville P.D.
Do you speak English?
- Yeah, I do. Of course. Yeah.
- So, what's all the commotion?
- Well, someone
stole meinpuppets.
- How many puppets do you have?
- Five of them.
And two were in
near-mint condition.
- Five puppets?
This incident is starting
to turn into a happening.
- Mom, just want to take some
time and re-evaluate things,
you know, not rush into
anything like I did last time.
Yeah, and the gallery is taking
up plenty of my attention now.
No, not once since New Year's,
not even a little sip.
Thanks.
It was hard at first, but, uh,
now I don't even miss it.
Yeah, except maybe a
little bit at openings.
Yeah, well, we'll see.
There's at least eight others
that are up for auction,
and the condition of mine...
You know, it isn't the best.
I'm hoping to get like
$3,000 for it, maybe $2,000.
Okay. Yeah.
Go enjoy your bridge game.
Say hi to Betty for me.
Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom.
- Yeah!
- Okay, here it comes.
Yes, Jonathan...
- sleeping on one of my
friends' couch for a while.
- Anne? Was that you?
- Maybe my new boss
would let me stay here
between shifts.
- Anne, you making that noise?
Hey. You fall asleep, babe?
Anne!
What the fuck? Babe!
Oh, fuck! Fuck! What... Babe!
What the fuck happened to you?!
- Hey, wanna go to a strip club?
- You're a genius.
- Totally.
- You're a genius.
You already forgot about the
strip club, didn't you?
- Nah, man. Nah,
I didn't forget.
- You see those things?
- What things?
- The three little guys that
just ran under the van.
That sounds "doobie-ous."
- Howie, I'm gonna need
the first and last name
of every guest in
the hotel, okay?
- Okay.
- What are you looking
so nervous about?
- The police make me nervous.
- Where were you...
Brown.
What?
That's unbelievable. Where?
All right. I'm on my way
with the hotel manager.
- What's that?
- What's going on?
- Uh, just, um... There's...
- Oh, my God.
- Hello?
Huh? What? Both of them?
The Gottliebs?
Ah. I'll... I'll... I'll... I'll...
I'll tell the police.
Just keep the door shut and
don't touch anything, okay?
Detective Brown, uh,
two more bodies were...
found by housekeeping.
- We should leave.
- Yeah, we should go.
- We really... Yeah. Okay.
- Get the stuff. Get your stuff.
- Hold on a sec. What is that?
- Edgar...
- I just... I...
- Wait right there.
- I wouldn't, um...
go in there.
- Eagerly awaiting to see if
there's a new DDT Ironman.
- Ironman heavyweight.
- Heavymetalweight.
Heavymetal championship.
How dare he forget that?
Oh, no!
And a dip lock! He's so strong.
Has he flipped anybody
as big as Moose?
- Hey, Howie!
There's a lot of
blood down here!
- Uh, Dete... Detective Brown?
Detective Brown?
We need you out here, please.
This is...
- What now?
- I-I don't know. Just...
Just... Just come this way.
- Who's staying in this room?
- Hezekiah Buckland.
- Hezekiah?
- Hezekiah Buckland...
What kind of name is that?
- It's a gypsy name.
I Googled it.
- These are hate
crimes, Detective.
A gypsy, a lesbian,
and a Jewish couple
have all been murdered.
Somebody is very clearly...
- Please let me do my job, all right?
This is my job.
Howie, I want every guest
in the hotel downstairs
in the lobby of the
convention center right now.
Attendance is mandatory. - Yeah.
- If they're not dead,
they're suspects.
Walker, you know the drill.
Tape off the room.
Nobody gets in.
Come on, Howie. Let's go.
- Edgar, what's happening?
- Hi.
Um, we're gonna text Markowitz
and see if he's okay. - Okay.
- Have you ever been
to Dallas before?
- Um, twice. I-I liked it there,
but it was pretty expensive.
- Well, not if you know
the right spots to hit
and, um, have a place to stay.
- You didn't hide it from me.
- What?
- Your password. Most
people hide it from me.
My last boyfriend did.
- Well... I trust you.
And, plus, Empress Asayuki is
a woman of honor, is she not?
- Yeah. Yeah, she is.
- No, no.
Okay. I got to tell you, this is
just technically fan fiction,
but I prefer it
significantly to,
like, the last two or three
theatrical releases.
Here.
- That's cool.
- Yeah.
- You're selling one
at the auction?
- One what?
That's not mine.
Actually, I don't really
know how that got here.
- Mm. Maybe it walked.
Huh.
Looks like somebody ripped
off one of his arms.
This one doesn't have
any hair, either.
I don't think this Edgar's.
- This is the police department!
Every single person is required
to go down to the
lobby right now!
This is an emergency!
Everybody go downstairs!
- Okay.
- Everybody go
downstairs right now!
- Oh, uh, snag a jacket, love.
Who knows how long
this will take?
- I thought you
gonna keep me warm.
- Don't stall.
- This one?
- Hurry, love.
- Aaah! Aaah!
I'm gonna text him again.
- Okay. Actually, no. Wait.
Look.
- Hey. Markowitz, hey.
- Finally.
- Hey, I'm glad you're okay.
- Uh, hi. Sorry.
Uh, is everybody... Can
everybody hear me?
- Fuckin' cop's
looking right at me.
- We should fuckin' leave.
- This is Detective Brown from
the Postville Police Department.
He's going to explain
what's happening here.
Um... Detective Brown?
- Okay. Now, as many
of you already know,
there's been multiple
cases of theft and murder
at the Brass Buckle
this evening.
The police department is here
to investigate those crimes,
and we're gonna have
to interview each
and every one of you
before the night is over.
We'd like to prioritize anyone
who may have witnessed...
- Detective, do you
think it's safe for us
to be here, given
the circumstances?
- Hold all questions
until I'm through.
No one's leaving the
building unless authorized
by the police department,
and that's not going to happen
in the near future, so...
- What?
- What?
- You got backup power?
- Yeah, we should.
- Okay, now, in the event
of a power failure,
the backup generator
will kick in,
so we won't be left in the dark.
Now, does anybody think he or
she may have seen something...
- It isn't safe for
us to stay here.
I mean, there have been murders
and thefts and other...
- No one is leaving
this building
until the police have completed
their investigation.
Get the doors.
And from now on,
anyone who interrupts me will
be charged with obstruction.
- You can't lock us in.
- Stay where you are!
Do not attempt to
leave the building!
- Run!
- Stop!
- Doreski, stand down!
- Come on.
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
- Hey! Travis! Open the door!
Travis!
What are you doing?!
- I'm trying... I'm
trying to start...
- Start the fucking caaaaaaaaar!
- It's not working!
- What the fuck?! Oh, my God!
- No!
- Now I know what
killed my brother.
- Kid! Come on!
Come on!
We got to go in.
Stay behind the Cuddly Bear.
Hold on to my silk tight.
Kid!
- These doors are staying shut.
- Everyone, come on.
Let's regroup in here.
We got to make a plan.
- I think we can defend ourselves
better in the Easy Comfort.
- Fine. Let's regroup in
the Easy Comfort, then.
- Stick with him. I
have to get something.
Everybody should
take one of these
so we know what
we're up against.
- You're saying a puppet killed
little cuz, a goddamn toy?
- I know it sounds insane,
but we all saw what we
saw in the parking lot.
- Some of us did more than
just see these things.
- This is crazy.
- We've called for
police assistance,
the two nearest towns,
but they're not gonna be
here for at least two hours.
- Two hours?
- Fuck. Double fuck.
- Right. So we're gonna
have to figure out a way
to defend ourselves right now.
Anybody have any idea
how this is happening,
how these puppets are
doing what they're doing?
All right.
Then we catch one
and figure out how it works.
- You and your blue
buddies seem to be
the only ones with the guns.
- Yeah, and that's a good thing,
considering the terrible
judgment some of you
have exercised so far.
So, we catch one,
we take it apart,
we figure out how it works, how
to stop it, how to kill it.
Any idea as to how
many there might be?
- 63 were to be auctioned off
tomorrow, so maybe 40, 45?
- Biscuits!
- Okay. The next logical
question is, "Why?"
- Because they're Nazis.
Think about it.
They've targeted a Jewish
couple, a gay woman, a gypsy,
and they were made by a guy who
worked for the Third Reich.
I don't think that's
a coincidence.
- They were attacking
pretty indiscriminately
in the parking lot.
- Okay, well, that's different.
That's... That's when
people were trying to flee
and they were fighting back
so they were just pissed.
- Why would a guy
like "Too-lon"...
- It's "Toulon."
- Why would anybody
create a Nazi puppet?
- Because a puppet would
be a very good spy.
They're little. They're fast.
They can go around unnoticed,
find undesirables, okay?
If Anne Frank was hiding in your
attic, a puppet could find her.
- What do you mean,
like a bloodhound?
- Exactly, except one
that you would give to a
kid for their birthday.
- What exactly do you do, Mr.
Easton?
- I write and draw comic books.
- And that makes you
an authority on this?
Nazi puppets?
- I have an imagination.
I also have an asshole
cop for a father,
so this whole bit
doesn't intimidate me.
- Why now? Why here, Mr...
Mr. Comic Book?
- I don't know. I don't know.
But I happen to think
that you're right.
We have to catch
one, take it apart.
- I'll do it. My
great-grandfather...
He had the numbers on his arm.
The stories that
he told us, uh...
If these Nazi
puppets want a Jew,
then I'll be the bait, okay?
But you got to promise me that
after we find out
what we need to know,
that you will let
me kill the fucker.
- You have a plan?
- You got a menorah in storage?
- Markowitz, stay back.
- Fuck! Ahh!
- Come on, kid. Go! Out!
Grab that puppet!
- Okay. This one's
called Mechaniker.
- Yeah. That's German
for "mechanic."
- Thank you. I think we
could've figured that out.
- This purple thing...
What is this, a...
A hard drive, a motor?
What the hell activated it?
- Maybe it's something local.
- Like what?
- Aaaah!
- Scheisse.Shit.
Shit.
- It's Junior Fuerher.
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.
- Kill that fucking baby!
- Nice shot.
- Thanks.
- I think he's dead.
- Yeah.
- Give me that fucking thing.
Let's see how you like it.
- Get behind me.
- I-I got a first-aid
kid in the office.
- Yeah, come out of there. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
- We got to hide somewhere else.
- Okay, everyone,
go up to a room or an office.
Seal it up till help comes,
'cause what happened
in that parking lot
is about to happen in here.
Let's go.
- Okay, wait here.
- No, no, no, I'm armed.
I should...
- No, no, no, no. I'll go first.
- Take this.
- Get... Get... Get back.
Oh, shit.
Ohh.
Check everywhere.
- Nothing. There's nothing.
- Shh, shh.
- H-Hello?
Someone help me?
- Shouldn't we help her?
- I just think that going outside
right now is not a good idea.
- So we're just
gonna let her die?
- There's a pretty big
pile of dead people
right outside of that
door right now, okay?
If the puppets find out
where we are, it's over.
- Sh'ma Yisra'eil, Adonai El...
- What is she saying?
- She's saying the Shema,
which is the prayer
that Jews say before they die.
Goddamn these fucks,
these fucking Nazis.
All right, that's it.
Give me the gun.
- You can't go out there.
- No.
What I can't do is just sit here
and let this happen to us again.
- You changed your mind
because she's Jewish?
- Yep.
- Why?
- I got about six
million reasons why.
I'm not gonna fight you
on this one, all right?
I'm going out there,
armed or not.
- Hey...
let's do this. - What?
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Take this. Just... Just take it.
- Thank you.
- Edgar.
Hey...
don't shoot Markowitz, okay?
- Sorry.
- Sh'ma Yisra'eil, Adonai El...
Elo... Eloheinu.
- Oh! Fuck it!
Guys? Guys?
Guys?
Aaaaaaaaah!
- Oh, my God.
- All right.
Yep. Got you.
All right.
- It's about time I woke
up from this dream.
- Yeah. We all should.
- What about the woman?
- We were too late.
- No!
Gun!
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.
- Open the window and jump down.
Dedicate your next
comic to me...
to a great...
Jewish hero.
Shalom, amigo.
- Goodbye.
- Nerissa...
do you think you would
have s-slept with me?
You know, if I'd, like, took
you to some nice restaurants
and didn't say
anything too s-stupid?
-60% chance.
- That's good to know.
- Wow.
- We need to jump.
It's our best option... unless
you think we should go up.
- I'm sorry.
- You okay?
- Nerissa, we got to go!
Come on!
Come on!
Check for keys. - Okay.
- Ahh!
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, man.
- Are we just gonna leave
everyone back there?
- I think I have an idea
how we can help them.
- Toulon's Mansion?
- My guess is that's
what switches them on,
maybe even controls them.
- I hope you're right.
- It's me they want.
- Why do they want you, Howie?
- Because I'm...
I'll go in. I'll go in.
- Howie, no.
- I'll go in.
- Howie! Howie! You're no
hero, so don't even try it.
- Now, don't get the sniffles.
Your Cuddly Bear helped
kill some puppet niggas
and can handle
hisself just fine.
Just do what I asked you
to do until I get home.
- Okay. I'll take a bubble bath.
- That'll give Cuddly Bear
something real nice
to think about.
Now go get yourself
effervescent.
- I will.
- Bye, Lady Bear.
- Bye.
- Oh, shit.
- Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!
- What?
- Oh, my God.
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
It's okay.
That was really
brave back there.
- That was really
brave of you, too.
- Not bad for a
comic-book guy, right?
So, I've been meaning to say
something to you for a while.
I just want to explain
why I didn't read
those comics you gave me.
- You don't have to explain that.
- No, I...
- It doesn't matter. It...
- Madame Lightning's based
on your ex-wife, isn't she?
- Yeah.
- Well...
the thing is...
I like you...
a lot.
And those drawings
felt like love letters
written to somebody else, and...
Yeah.
- It was that obvious?
- Yeah. It was to me.
- You don't have to
be jealous, um...
'cause the truth is...
I'm falling in love you,
and I only didn't tell you
because I thought it
would freak you out.
So... there.
- Edgar.
- You have to let me drive.
- Okay.
- Let me drive. Let me drive.
- Did you just say... I
heard that you love me?
Is that correct?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- I just wish I could
remember your name.
- Again.
- Okay.
We're here.
Remember that creepy
old building?
- Yeah. The mausoleum.
- Put on your seatbelt.
- You have a plan, right?
- I do, but I can't
tell you the whole plan
because I think you
will probably panic.
- Panic? Why?
- Looks like the
nigga's outta juice.
Bitch-ass puppet.
Ohh! Ugh!
- Howie?
Howie?
Ugh.
Aw, shit, kid.
- Oh, shit.
- It's okay. Just try again.
- Aah!
- Oh, my God. You okay?
You okay? You okay?
- Oh, my God.
Was that Andre Toulon?
- I don't know. I think so, yeah.
- Okay.
- Noooooooooo!
- I wanted to tell you that I
think the new Madame Lightning's
even better than the first one.
- I agree.
- A-And, man,
this issue's really messed up.
L-Lots of terrible shit happens
to people who don't deserve it.
- Yeah. I, uh... I try to mirror
reality in my work, so...
- Are you gonna do some more?
- Um... yeah, probably.
I don't feel like things
are fully resolved.
Hi. - Hi.
- Uh, just one?
- Don't ask.
Don't ask.
