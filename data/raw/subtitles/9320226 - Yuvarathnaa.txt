Hi Sameera!
You're the State topper of PU exams.
We're proud of you!
Congratulations!
Sir?
We've to follow the procedure.
The police are here.
Please sir.
If you educate a woman,
you educate a family.
Hereafter,
your daughter's my responsibility.
She topped her 10th
and 12th exams.
How can she fail
this entrance exam?!
No! A re-evaluation has to be done.
Hit it, Harischandra!
Party hard!
The Chairman of RNC group!
His college has topped the
KCET results this year.
Congratulations brother!
Take a look!
Look how cheerfully my
college students are dancing.
They believe private colleges
are their Holy Shrine.
And treat us - the ones who run
the colleges, as their Gods.
Their parents end up selling
everything they own and pledge their
...hard-earned gold to pay for the
college fees and donation money.
Even if a Government college offers free
education, none of them will take it up.
All they want is a college building,
hi-fi infrastructure and hi-fi crowd.
In India, it's not the
educated who are clever.
It's us, the educators,
who are the geniuses.
The Medical and Engineering
sectors have seen its boom.
Let's get the Commerce
sector booming!
How long will the Medical and
Engineering students rake all the moolah?
Let our commerce students
too have some fun.
[IN UNSION] We want justice!
[NEWS REPORT] Government colleges
protest against the K-CET board.
Pressure builds to re-evaluate the exam
papers of Government college students.
The board isn't responsible if Government
colleges protest to hide their failures.
People believe you're highlighting
this incident because the
...deceased is a Muslim girl.
What do you have to say?
Only our college application forms
have sections for Religion and caste.
Once selected,
all the students are equal.
Our religion is India.
Our caste is Kannada.
WE WANT.. JUSTICE! [IN UNISON]
[PROTEST CRIES CONTINUE]
RADHAKRISHNA, DOWN DOWN!
RADHAKRISHNA, DOWN DOWN!
Hello Sir.
You're the DC of Bangalore.
What's your reason to
support this strike?
I'm in an esteemed position
in this country and society.
I studied in a
Government college too.
R K University.
Government colleges have shaped the
lives of millions of students like me.
I have a request to make to the
board on behalf of the students.
This paper needs to be re-evaluated
in presence of the University panel.
WE WANT JUSTICE!
RADHAKRISHNA, DOWN DOWN!
This is a sensitive matter.
I'm aware of it.
It wasn't just your college
student who suffered.
Many students across entire
Karnataka's Government Aided
...and Unaided colleges
have attempted suicide.
Sameera was unfortunate.
If students from other colleges
in the state sign the petition
...along with your students,
I can take it forward.
It's not just your college
that is facing the brunt.
What say, DC sir?
Madam, the law has the same to
say, right?
This protest is not only for
the students of our college.
This protest is for each and every
student of this state and country.
We will do it sir.
Thank you.
Thank you sir.
- You've my support too. Thank you.
Mr. Jaipal...
I'm reaching out to all the Colleges and
Universities in the state personally,
...for the cause of injustice that
Sameera and other students faced
...and I'm seeking their support
for my petition against it.
I'll make sure I
garner all the support.
Until then,
this college is your responsibility.
By the way, don't stop the 50th
anniversary celebrations of R K University.
Students should move on
from the Sameera incident.
A positive atmosphere
needs to be created.
Yes sir.
- Take care.
Your college shouldn't
sign this petition.
Okay sir.
Stop your students...
- Yes sir.
Or else,
I'm going to shut your college.
Students,
we have orders from the management.
Our college should not
sign this petition.
Sir, what if our students face
the same situation in the future?
You cannot go against the college.
Not happening sir.
We will sign this.
[IN UNSION] WE WILL SIGN THIS!
Hello? Sir...
Don't beat him!
Don't force us to turn this
college into a burial ground.
I'm warning you!
Brother, hear me out!
He's not like others.
He's not the one to be messed with.
I knew there was a
lighthouse in Mangaluru.
Only today, did I learn that
there's a Powerhouse too!
He's come looking for us,
to this very port.
He's a Monster!
A MONSTER!
Setu!
He was right here.
Keep moving!
He must be around.
- Comb the entire port.
Where is he?!
- He was right here...
Must have chickened out!
- A coward!
How dare you mess with us?!
You think you can enter our
world, and intimidate us?!
There are three kinds
of men in this world!
The one who follows the rules.
The one who breaks the rules.
And I'm of the third kind...
The one who rules!
I came here to tell you not to
mess with my college students.
Your friend went
straight for my collar.
One shouldn't dare touch a
woman's skirt and a man's collar.
He broke that rule.
And I broke him!
Brace yourself to face a
Tsunami that will destroy you.
The Tsunami took form
in the sea long ago.
You're late!
It's none of your business to get
involved in administrative matters!
How dare you go against
the college's decision?
Once I take a stand on
something, I stay put.
I don't swerve from my path.
Because both the circuit
and the ride's mine.
Let a Ferrari come by,
and I won't give a damn.
The students were warned for against
the college. What's wrong in that?
I too warned them for getting
physical with my boys.
What's wrong in that?
You're rusticated
from this college.
I'm glad you said it.
Even my boys won't set foot
in a lacklustre place like this.
And you think,
I'm going to stay?
Heâ€™s a brand,
donâ€™t you dare stop him in his way
Heâ€™s an explosion that wonâ€™t
stop roaring; move aside
He needs no one to
keep surging forward
For no one can rival
this unstoppable force
Donâ€™t you dare flaunt your guts
Donâ€™t you try to intimidate him
Donâ€™t you lose control
and mess with him
Remember, I watch in
silence while I keep smiling
But don't ever come in my way
FEEL THE POWER!
FEEL THE POWER!
FEEL THE POWER!

Heâ€™s no Show off,
but is the ultimate Showman
He speaks straight from his heart
His words can set the world ablaze;
unfading as it burns on
He follows no one,
it's his path till the end
His following too, is revolutionary
Try provoking him,
and youâ€™ll be encountered
This is the Breaking
News of the day
Kindly follow the guidelines
The rule belongs to him
The rules are made by him
Donâ€™t try gloating around him
Remember, no matter how old you grow

For no can rival this
unstoppable force
Not bad! All of them look
like college students!
Get them admitted into
Jnanasagar, STA college
...especially into R K University.
They should blend in
with the students,
...divert them from studies
and disrupt their lives.
You need to lead this gang
and I need daily updates.
Yes sir.
- All the best boys!
How's the Josh?
- High sir!
Don't be a bunch
of goody two shoes.
Get wicked!
Only when I turned wicked,
did I make it big. Remember?
Principal's busy.
He won't be able to meet you.
Please leave.
What?!
I've been waiting for two hours!
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]
Excuse me? Sir!
This is a social cause.
The petition needs to be signed.
You have to support this.
How much are you making
from this campaign?
How can you exploit the death of a
girl to save your college's reputation?
We haven't lost any of
our college students.
We have clear instructions
not to support this cause!
I'll let you know when one of ours dies.
You may...
How dare you talk
to me like this?
You're playing around with
the lives of students.
We're inside a college. Please come.
- You...!
It's okay. Let's calm down.
- Cowards!
Sir, let's leave from here.
- They've sold their souls!
You didn't just teach
lessons to students like me.
You guided us.
You imparted confidence
along with knowledge.
They say that one should have a goal
ahead, and a Guru behind.
And you are one
such righteous Guru.
You've helped all of
us reach our goals.
You will reach your goal too.
Your students stand by you.
You and our college are
role models to the world.
Be brave and push ahead!
Jai Hind! Take care.
- Thank you.
Bruce Lee, get some men from
Mangaluru for our operations.
I've informed Shetty about it.
One of his men has come
down with a contract!
Get him admitted to R K University.
Lo and behold the Ruler!
Sri Sri Ranadheera Kanteerava!
Looks like he's
taken after Annavaru.
Sir?
- Silence!
I shall never hide and fight the war!
Twenty five lambs are here
to assassinate a lone Lion!
Your Highness!
- Yes?!
Don't lose your temper.
- Is that so?!
Sir, the mace is coming in
contact with another mace!
Is she supposed to be the Queen?
And does he look like an Emperor?
[MUFFLED MUMBLE]
Why does the Queen look like that?
How else will the
Aaya (helper) look?
The Aaya in her isn't
prepared to be the Queen.
Look at her in that blue saree.
No wonder you found out.
This play is being put up
by the non-teaching staff.
The Admin's the Emperor.
The Aaya's the Queen.
The security guards
are the doorkeepers.
Lab technicians and Hostel
wardens are the Ministers.
And who's the director
of this wretched play?
I am...
The computer science lecturer.
Oy' Queen!
Get rid of the blue saree!
Get rid of it.
- Fine.
Sir, a guy has come
looking for you.
You there,
tell him what the matter is!
Talk respectfully.
I'll deal with him.
Get going from here!
Take a hike! Move!
Who are you, Sire?
- My name's Arjun.
I'm the son of College
Librarian Govind's friend.
I wanted to join the
Seventh semester.
Heard your Vice-Principal
has given the go ahead.
Speaking of high influence, huh?
This college is running
on recommendations.
It has gone to the dogs after
admitting every tom, dick and harry!
Move!
Lord Kanteerava!
Come along.
I wanted to know a few
things about this college.
Somebody call the Opponent King.
He wishes to get a look at the college.
Take him around.
And him?
- The Peon!
This is the degree block.
No one's paying heed inside
or bothering on the outside.
This is the Engineering block.
Long ago,
Engineers would travel in cabs.
Now,
they drive passengers in them.
All thanks to Corona.
- Looks like he's new to college.
Stop right there.
Go on. Keep moving.
Didn't I tell you?
Dude, let's mess around a bit.
This is the Library!
- When did I call it a Mortuary?
Keep walking.
The smoke's already
in your lungs. Go on.
They're all defective pieces.
All thanks to addictive vices.
Refer this until the
new book arrives.
That is the medical block.
They're the ones who slit and rip us off.
That is the auditorium.
Medical students are practising
dance for the 50th year celebrations.
You've no use from it.
Let's go.
I'll take a look and
decide how useful it is.
What does Choli mean?
- Choli's a blouse.
Chunari's a skirt.
- Did I ask you?
Who is she?
- The Doctor.
And I'm her Patient.
Your song's superb.
Your dance's superb.
Your grace's superb and
your troop is superb too.
But the groom doesn't have
the very necessary thing.
Huh?!
He's expressionless.
Either change the song
or change your partner.
And who are you
to tell us that?!
The Supreme Fan!
Dude, share a cigarette with me.
Take off your damn shirt!
- Stoop down! Squat!
What are you staring at?
- I'll smack you!
Sir, please let us go.
Ankith, your Madhu's here.
- Madhu!
I'm not Madhu.
I'm Mahesh.
You're my Madhu!
- I'm Mahesh. Not your Madhu.
Hand me the grass!
Sir, please let me go!
You! Come here.
Have you watched Om?
We were the ones who produced it.
Huh?
You guys are lingering around the entry
scene, I've already made it to the climax.
I'm a fan of Sathya too.
Do you have a long
(machete) with you?
Do you have one?
Here, take it back.
Let's go.
- Madhu!
The torn underwear's mine.
The faded one's mine.
- Madhu?
Thank you brother.
- Keep moving.
Please sir.
I desperately need it.
Desperate for the stuff, huh?
There you go.
Go have fun!
Give me some.
Get some corner seats in a cinema
and stay away from classes.
Who's next?
New admission?
Attending classes is prohibited.
What will you take?
Cash or Dope?
Does he look like
a dope head to you?
Take it!
What are you doing?!
Hand me ten thousand bucks
and I'll have some fun.
Five hundred bucks doesn't
even cover my OLA, UBER ride.
Sir?
- Hmmm?
Go ahead with the class, sir.
- Are you new here?
I can't conduct the lecture
for only fifteen of you.
Don't we count as students to you?
I'll teach them at
my coaching Center.
You can join them.
I'll coach you too.
I've paid for the college lectures.
Not for a coaching class.
Clearly you need the
lessons more than I do.
I will not be taking the class.
Do whatever you want.
Fantastic!
- It will be, sir.
Doesn't this college allow a lecture if
there are only fifteen students in a class?
Give me two minutes.
I'll finish the cultural
meeting and attend to you. Okay?
Excuse me?
How are the preparations for
the Golden Jubilee coming along?
It's going well, sir.
We'll need the
funds sooner though.
Funds will take time.
Manage until then.
Feel free to give them the donation
money I paid along with the fees.
Wait for two minutes.
The programs should go well.
And each program should
be unique, okay?
Sure sir.
Who is this guy?
Will there be no lecture if there
are only fifteen students in a class?
Who told you that?
- The Thermodynamics Lecturer.
Murali Manohar.
Look, he's a senior lecturer.
And you're new here.
Have some patience!
- What's all this sir?
Do we have to explain
ourselves to a student?
He'll stay if he wishes to...
Or else, he is free to leave.
Mister!
I'll talk to him.
You may leave now.
Hurry up sir. Or else I'll
have to go looking for him.
Excuse me?
You seem familiar to me.
Do you live in Basavanagudi?
Nah. More like Gandhadagudi.
I'll see you sir.
Keep an eye on him.
He seems like a troublemaker.
Hi...
- Hey!
I thought of having a chat with
you in the Vice-Principal's room.
Then I got thinking.
What if you threw attitude,
in turn hurting my ego
...and pissing me off?
So only the social distancing.
Did you change the song?
- Oh, we didn't.
Got rid of the partner itself.
You're very straightforward.
You don't hold back
anything, right?
All I do is talk.
Are you an Engineering student?
- Yep...
I'm a...
- You don't have to say it.
Your appearance tells me
you're a medical student.
You look like a capsule.
What is this guy even?
Don't you want my phone number?
I'm not the one to flirt
or fall for someone.
Be careful. Bye.
Looks like a Demigod
on the outside.
But is clearly an Osama
Bin Laden on the inside.
I'm sorry bro.
Move it!
Move away!
Why is he here?
Sit.
Bro, I'll get out of here.
- Sit down!
If you say so, bro.
Brother,
I came here for that very reason.
I was here even
before you came by.
That is all I know.
I thought it was a good deal.
I had no idea you were involved.
No one should know about me.
I'll disappear from here, brother.
Please spare me!
- If they find out...
I won't speak a word.
He'll kill me.
Slay me right here.
I'm sorry sir. I can't let my
students sign your petition.
You may leave.
The 'Justice for Sameera'
campaign has my support.
This is Samarth Bhagwat,
the DC of Bangalore.
Please lend your support too.
Save Government colleges.
WE WANT JUSTICE [IN UNISON]
[PROTEST CRIES CONTINUE]
We've planned a project to
equip Government colleges
...and Aided colleges with
optimum teaching facilities.
I stand with
Government colleges.
Sir, we now have five thousand
students' signatures for the petition.
Leave a lasting impression
Keep steering ahead
Be an unwavering voice
Be your own companion
What fate holds, is beyond us
The destiny we aim for,
is always on us
Let us be the author
of our own lives
Who will dare stop us
from being ourselves?
WE WANT JUSTICE!
Namaskara (Salutations) DC Sir!
I'm Antony Joseph.
I'm the MD of RNC group.
- Tell me.
You're the son of the Wisdom Goddess and
I, of the Goddess of Wealth.
The two Goddesses
never go hand in hand.
Because women tend to
be highly egoistic.
They want men with Government jobs
but not the ones with Government salaries.
I think no woman will be happy with
a man who only has a salary to offer.
Excuse me?!
Money is of the least priority
for those who love their job.
I'm doing this job out
of the love for it!
My voice is for my
college and my teacher.
Justice for Sameera
campaign will continue.
Looks like Private colleges have
started getting the shivers.
Fearful of losing out
to the Wealth Goddess.
Where there's Wisdom,
there's no ego.
Wealth will follow.
And if a woman can't stand
a man who only has his
...hard earned salary money
to offer; I'd rather remain single.
Bachelors are highly regarded
in our country right now.
If you ever think of
messing with my college...
I won't spare you.
See you around.
According to the
Illustration, Human bones...
Why are you acting
like a Covid patient?
You'll be fine. Keep moving.
You'll meet Karishma over there.
He shouldn't find out
that I'm a lecturer.
Look at the board.
Madam, sit by my side everyday
and take all the classes.
That would be hot.
All of you make a note.
I'll be back in a moment.
He's fine now.
It's a case of food poisoning.
He had soft drinks last night.
Somebody must have drugged it.
The chemicals have
made him sick.
The number of drug addicts
in our college has gone up.
The supply of drugs is rampant.
Our college has changed a lot.
Medical students aren't
getting any cases for studies.
Weren't you lamenting
that our college
...hardly has cases
or patients to study?
His broken wrist and your specialisation
being Orthopaedics is a perfect match now.
Come on. Heal him.
There won't be any noise.
Study him. Get started.
Shall I break his left hand?
Will you practice? Come.
Brother, we're Cardiologists.
If you had any heart patients for
us, it would help us.
Do I look like someone
who supplies patients?
Go online and get one!
Help our department sir.
How about I get
admitted as a patient?
Brother, we need a case
for our Dental study.
You guys are asking as if I'm
selling tomatoes over here.
Brother?
Sir, please.
[IN MALAYALAM] Brother,
our department needs a patient.
[IN TELUGU] Brother,
we need a liver for study.
Thrash another goon for us.
Please?
Don't...
He's not our target.
We're here for the college.
Internals and Lab
exams are nearing.
None of the students
should be able to focus.
Nurse check his BP every two hours.
- Doctor, what happened to them?
Hello Doctor.
They're all patients of drug abuse.
With no drugs in their
system in the last few days,
...they've hurt themselves
overcome by anxiety and irritation.
The gravest case in
here is that of Ankith.
He fell off the building
and has fractured his knees.
He's also mentally unstable.
He's very disturbed.
It's the same case with everyone here.
They're all in need
of rehabilitation.
If they weren't brought here in
time, their lives would be in danger.
For further treatment,
Doctor Kokila Raman will be coming.
If you know anything
more, help them out.
I've done my job. The rest...
- Move! Sir...
Someone dressed like a
joker is approaching.
Did a patient of yours escape?
Looks like sir's here.
Is he a doctor?
Uncle!
Hello Doctor!
Did you get your
Ramayana book after all?
You tried so hard for it.
Why worry?
The case ended in our favour.
Read more.
Keep reading Ramayana, okay?
He's also a Mind reader.
You're a Good boy.
He seems stoned to the hilt,
how will he rehabilitate them?
He's been in a Rehab before.
He knows the mentality of its patients.
You don't worry.
Just support him.
Dear Daughter...?
- Daddy!
My baby!
There's no father like you...
[POPULAR KANNADA SONG]
Wait and watch sir.
I love you daddy!
Who are you?
- The doctor's assistant.
Get lost!
What's happening here?
Wait until I get out.
I wonâ€™t spare you!
Dude, I'll never let you out of here!
Get going!
I had no idea that this college and its
students are in such horrendous condition.
If word gets out,
our college's reputation will be tainted.
Make sure nobody knows about this.
- Sure sir.
Sir, he's our senior
Psychologist Dr. Kokila Raman.
I'm Jaypal, the Vice-Principal.
- Glad to meet you sir.
I'm Ranadheera Kanteerava.
Wait, do we have an empty bed?
Why?
- You should hear yourself.
Doctor, how are things?
Yes.
There are a lot of issues here.
I will leave only after
I resolve them all.
You see the radiance in my
eyes, don't you?
Only the cataract is visible.
Get it operated.
See you doctor.
- Let's go.
Radiance...? All I see is a booger.
There is an issue.
A big one at that!
You're right sir.
What do we do now?
Sir?
Inject this into him.
What was the management doing when
drugs were making its way into the college?
We're trying hard to keep
Government colleges afloat
...and you're
only making it worse.
That's not the case sir.
- I'll take serious action.
Every Government college
will receive a notice.
This shouldn't repeat.
Be careful.
Sorry sir.
- Good.
Namaskara
- Glad to see Gurudev Deshmukh.
How are you?
Hope everything's fine.
All thanks to your
support and inspiration.
80,000 students and 58 colleges
have signed the petition.
This college too will join us.
We will submit it to the
court at the earliest.
Your support for Government
colleges is much needed.
Definitely. All the best.
- Thank you.
I shall take your leave now.
Let's go in.
Basya?
His body's leaned to the left.
And THAT has leaned to the right.
Why is his sight
pointing to that side?
There lies the problem!
Mister Curls, speak up!
He's not even fluttering
his eyelashes.
He's under observation.
He needs time to recover.
Excuse me? I'll just be back.
All he did was look and then
came... those damned tears!
This is a case of failed love.
- I know.
A girl broke his heart.
- Brother...
Girls only know how to break hearts.
And all boys know is to mend hearts.
Don't get confused.
Tell me more.
Since his love failed,
he's become an addict.
There's a bigger
problem at stake.
Hallucinations.
He experiences visual
hallucinations.
Whenever he sees a
couple in front of him,
...he begins to hallucinate
thinking of his lover.
Just like how he saw you both
and is hallucinating now.
The two of you will have to
be happy in front of him.
One more failed love story and
it might be the end of his story.
Let's go Basya.
Arjun?
Arjun?!
What are you doing?!
- Woah!
Look at that Basya, he's elated.
He's seeing himself and
his girlfriend in us.
Visual hallucinations.
See... He's reacting.
And he's happy.
The effort is his,
and look who's taking the credits!
They're made for each other.
Where is their cart of love?
- Their Cart...?!
Why are you acting like this?!
Control yourself, Doctor!
DOCTOR!
Sorry. I myself had a moment
of visual hallucination.
Get the ropes!
Tie him up!
I need to propose tomorrow.
Let me go.
Tomorrow's Valentine's Day!
Love-day!
Anju, I love you.
Will you be my...
- Do you love each other?
What's with the Roses?
Tie the knots now!
Sir, please don't do this.
- Tie it! Now!
Please don't do this.
- A Taali or a Rakhi? You choose!
[INDISTINCT COMMOTION]
You want her, right?
Tie the Taali !
Do it now!
You both are a great pair.
Tie the knots! Now!
Give it to me.
I'll show you how it's done.
Stop right there!
Everyone! Get her!
Stop right there!
Stop!
Look who's there!
How can you get married
without a priest?
You think you can marry without the
chants and a glimpse of the stars?
What say, Mr. Priest?
- You're right.
They're the Groom's family
and we are the Bride's family.
If you get them married soon,
we'll get the reception started.
Let the wedding begin!
Sir, give it a minute.
The inauspicious time
will come to an end.
We can then get started.
- Done, Mr. Priest.
Didn't you ask for
a heart patient?
Will two of them do?
I'll tie the Taali right away!
Listen to me.
The time's not right...
The Lord of Death
will hover on you.
Let go of my hand, you prick!
Mr. Priest,
looks like we're skipping the wedding
...and directly heading
for the last supper!
I'm all set to serve them!
- As you wish.
Thank you!
This one's for the dental branch.
Thank you sir.
His knee cap is in pieces!
Hurry up!
Mr. Priest, I don't hear
you chanting the mantras!
There's no way my mantra
will suit this occasion.
Time to read out the afterlife scriptures.
- Arjun!
With you.. here begins my fable
Iâ€™ve lived every line in it,
to the fullest
With meâ€¦ here begins your fable
For it has created another world of ours
This has never happened before
What does all of this mean?
Clouded with thoughts here I am,
yet all I can think of is you
Weâ€™re not two entities anymore,
but are one soul
I submit myself to you
You complete me,
and I complete you
The rest of my life is with you
You complete me, and I complete you
The rest of my life is with you
With you.. here begins my fable
Iâ€™ve lived every line in it,
to the fullest
With meâ€¦ here begins your fable
For it has created another world of ours
We are far apart, yet here we are,
living in the moment
Thereâ€™s nowhere else Iâ€™d rather
be on this globe, but within you
As the beats fill my racing heart,
I run out of breath
For all the loneliness
Iâ€™ve suffered, here you are
The sweetest and the
perfect cure there is
For all the affection that brims out of me,
the care you provide is the answer
Warding off all the evil glances from me,
your eyes continue to guard me.
You complete me,
and I complete you
The rest of my life is with you
You complete me,
and I complete you
The rest of my life is with you
With you.. here begins my fable
Iâ€™ve lived every line in it,
to the fullest
With meâ€¦ here begins your fable
For it has created another world of ours
This has never happened before
What does all of this mean?
Clouded with thoughts here I am,
yet all I can think of is you
Weâ€™re not two entities anymore,
but are one soul
I submit myself to you
You complete me,
and I complete you
The rest of my life is with you
You complete me, and I complete you
The rest of my life is with you
All you had to do
was ask for me.
It's sad that you messed
with someone's life.
Care for a cigarette?
All the fire I need is in here.
Don't need any more. Go on.
You are the right match for me.
Ever since I set my foot in the field,
there's no competition for me.
Only two kinds of people remain.
The kind I like.
The kind that likes me.
How long will you keep him there?
Put him down!
Nobody's ever touched my men.
And if they did,
they've never lived to tell the story.
Why did you hit him?
- Didn't you tell him why?
Irrespective of what the matter is,
there was no need to get physical.
I'm done smacking him and
got him treated too. Move on!
Do you wish to fight in the
college and become a don?
I'm from Mangaluru.
Shetty's aide.
They got me admitted in
the college. So I'm here.
Guys! He's one of us!
I was the one who asked
Shetty to send me his aide.
And he's sent me the
perfect man for it.
One of our men is already
in the college management.
If you build a coffin,
he'll cover it with a tombstone.
Once the dean's back in college,
you know what to do, right?
Yes.
He's one of ours.
Don't get into a brawl.
Leave him alone.
Hello?!
Shouldn't you be telling me that?
I'll leave them alone.
Don't worry. No more fistfights.
He's taken some whooping for you.
Take good care of him.
He's a Smiling Assassin.
I like him.
[VIOLENT PAINFUL SCREAMS]
Quit resisting!
- Inject the medicine!
PATIENT: Let me go!
Give her this.
- Doctor, what's happening?
Somebody has drugged them all.
Drugs? How did it make
it into the Rehab?
How do I know all that?
Doctor, we only have one option.
To stabilise them all.
Why take drugs and
scream your head off?
Get back to bed!
I'm not the one who's
enjoying the kick, you are!
The real kick lies in wooing your
lecturer and making a move on her!
What better high do you want?
- Shut up!
I'm not the one who's under influence.
You are.
You're the one enjoying the
high of hitting on a lecturer.
The dove of love has flown away
The dove of love has flown away
[IN UNISON]
Arjun!
- Quit monkeying around!
Get back to your beds now.
- Arjun!
We'll get our stuff
in the evening.
Didn't I give you
guys the tablets?
Why didn't you take it?!
Why should we take
the tablets you give?
Did I not tell you to take the tablets?
- We're not drug addicts.
Where's the Vice-Principal's chamber?
- Upstairs.
Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Well... Sir...
How are you doing?
I was just checking if they
took the tablets you'd prescribed.
All it took was
a bit of a force.
They're good boys.
They'll take the tablets.
Thank you sir.
Take care.
When did I prescribe
tablets for them?
Do you suspect anyone?
Students are being harassed
in the name of ragging.
Drugs are being consumed.
An anonymous complaint has been lodged
that all of this is troubling students.
Drugs? In our college?
There's absolutely no chance of that.
It's a false allegation.
Seems like a case of
personal vendetta.
Our college has a legacy
of fifty long years!
I'm an alumnus of this college.
- Oh, that's nice.
I won't let anyone taint the reputation
of this college and its students.
There's no one in the library.
Get here soon.
How will we meet if
there's another lockdown?
Is this the place to romance?
Get out!
What's your admission number?
What about yours lady?
We're sorry, sir.
- Get out!
Good afternoon ma'am
Make sure students get
any book they ask for.
Okay.
I want to know who
lodged the complaint!
Tell me!
I'll butcher each and every one
of you if you don't speak up now!
Who was it?
Tell me!
Who are you?
What is your motive to
be here in this college?
You hid from the cop
who came to enquire.
And you were hiding drugs
in the books at the Library.
The day I was harassed, you thrashed
every one of those gang members
And when the same gang is beating
up students, why are you not reacting?!
I'm here on a mission.
The mission is all I'm focusing on.
Arjun, boss is asking for us.
A meeting has been fixed.
We need to get there soon.
What are you staring at?
Come along!
What the hell is he doing here?!
He's one of our men. Don't panic!
Boss has planted
him in the college.
Hello everyone.
Please be seated.
RK University's Principal Gurudev
Deshmukh is returning tomorrow
...with a petition
signed by sixty colleges.
So only this meeting.
Sir, if this is
submitted in the court.
Everything we've
done will be exposed.
All our scams will be
out for the world to see.
If they find out that we've
ruined R K University,
...and that we're
involved in KCET scam.
We're done for.
Have some water.
If your BP shoots up,
you'll be gone in no time.
It's Dean Gurudev Deshmukh!
Hello?
- Sir...
Thanks to your political and moral
support, I've achieved it.
Many colleges are supporting us.
I will return tomorrow and
submit the petition in the court.
Excellent. I will come
along with you to the court.
Let's submit it together.
Justice will be done to you.
Thank you very much.
- I'll wait in the court for you.
Okay sir.
Sir..?!
I told him that I'll be
waiting at the court...
Did I mention anything about
him reaching the court?!
Politicians like me...
...are two-faced,
make two different promises,
...maintain two businesses
and handle two affairs.
One is to impress the public.
The other is to deceive
and screw them.
He's been staring
at me all along.
Who is he?
- He's Shetty's aide.
A sharp shooter.
Gurudev Deshmukh shouldn't
make it to the court tomorrow.
Having successfully completed the
'Justice for Sameera' campaign,
Dean of R K University,
Gurudev Deshmukh
...is heading to the court
to file his petition.
Did you get hold of him?
I'll be done in two minutes.
See you soon.
Yes. I'm here to
support this campaign.
The welfare of a Government college
student is important to me.
I'll support them.
Thank you.
Only ten minutes left
for the court hearing.
Namaste...
- Namaskara sir.
This court lies under
my jurisdiction sir.
I've been posted to handle the
security of the Education minister.
Hats off to your commitment.
Proud to be your student.
- Thank you.
Hello sir.
Thank you.
- You've done it!
Sir, it's time for
the court hearing.
Please go inside.
I'll be there in two minutes.
What happened?
Sir...
The court has decided
to handover the enquiry
...and investigation of
this case to the CBI.
Thank you sir.
Thank you Samarth.
- It's my duty sir.
Where is Arjun,
your college student?
[IN HINDI] Speak up!
Where is he now?
Speak out!
Or you'll be dead in seconds.
Internals, Classes and
Laboratories are on.
Students are studying
in the Library.
They've fought like barbarians.
Who all were involved
in this brawl?
A gang that came
from outside and...
One of our Engineering students.
Who is that idiot?!
He ran away twelve years ago.
Why has he returned?
His name's not Arjun.
He is not Arjun!
It's the final Rugby match
between GRV and R K University.
Here comes the captain.
The Macho...!
Go for it Yuva!
- Come on Yuvaraj!
Come on Yuvaraj!
Sisterf*!@#r got away!
A cop's beating will
make the headlines.
If boss retaliates,
you've neared your deadline.
DOWN WITH THE POLICE [IN UNISON]
Are those men supposed
to be his supporters?
They're his fans sir.
Am I not right?
To you, a fan might be another person;
but to me, they're my power.
They're my providers forever.
The most important
ones after my parents.
Don't talk about them hastily.
Do you even know how to behave
with a double-starred officer?
Sir, his star will last
until he's on duty.
The stardom they've bestowed
lasts until our last breath.
Damn it! Let him go.
These achievers are on the college's
wall of fame to inspire us.
So that you live an inspiring
life and motivate others.
I wish to see you on a
wall of fame like this.
Not on the notice board
of a Police station.
Yuvaraj, if you sit with Samarth,
you'll feel motivated. Come forward.
There you go.
- What's the occasion?
My friend is the
Student of the year.
There you go. Have some.
Why are you distributing sweets
as if you've won the award?
You're not a true friend if you don't
celebrate your friend's success.
Don't envy your neighbour's success.
Don't berate your own failure.
Clearly, you shouldn't be here.
Take some sweets and move!
Did you take some? Great!
Hello Madam!
He didn't pass because
you taught him,
...but 'cause he studied on his own.
Have some sweets.
A week to go for the exams.
Life outside college is a huge challenge.
You won't have your
teachers to forgive you.
It'll be your bosses.
The education you have
now is your foundation.
Money, Power, Status and
Reputation follows your education.
To make your life steady,
you have to study.
I only have one tip for you.
Control your anger.
Sir!
Sir... Yuvaraj is beating up
the Computer Science Lecturer.
You Loafer!
Sir, here's what he did...
- Shut up!
Whatever it is,
he's your lecturer.
How dare you hit your lecturer?
The one who raises his hand on his
Guru will never reach his goals!
Do you think you'll prosper?
Is this what is taught here?!
Students...
Become what you want in life.
But never end up like him!
This is as cheap as one can get!
Shut up!
Please hear me out!
- I don't want to see your face.
Get out this college!
I said get out.
Please listen to me once.
- Get out this college!
I'm sorry sir.
What wrong intentions
have you come with now?
Surely there are wrong intentions at play.
But they're not mine.
The ones you're trusting are wrong.
I came back as a student,
to spy one some people.
Our college was targeted
by the MD of RNC group.
Antony Joseph.
Several private colleges
have ganged up with him.
Our college is one of the
reputed Government colleges.
They realised that if
we continue to prosper,
...the demand for Government
colleges will go up.
So they've targeted the
results of Government colleges.
The outcome of which was
the failure of KCET exam results.
And the death of Sameera.
You started protesting.
But they ensured colleges
backed out from the protest.
They even put up an
act of supporting you.
When you were out campaigning,
they aimed to bring down our college.
They got junkies and criminals
admitted into the college.
They began to spoil the
lives of our students.
When I came to the college,
the situation had gone out of hand.
They assigned a Sharp shooter-Drug
peddler from Mangaluru to join our college.
I learnt about his
plans for the college.
He had come down to finish you and
spoil the students of this college.
I restrained him, took up his
identity and met Antony Joseph.
I joined his team and they
believed me to be one of them.
They revealed that one of his men
was working for him in our college.
I began looking for him.
I registered a complaint with
the police as an anonymous student
...claiming drugs were being
peddled in the college.
To investigate the
same, Azad came down.
I hid from him knowing
that if he identified me,
...my operation
would be in danger.
When he was here, I saw fear in
the eyes of the Vice-Principal.
But there seemed no
concern for the college.
When I visited the rehab to check
on the students at night,
...drugs were being injected into
the students who were recovering.
It was Vice-Principal, Jaipal.
The gang members were beating up the
students because of the complaint.
I didn't react then.
Because I was waiting to meet
the mastermind behind it.
There's a man above Antony Joseph.
Raghav Reddy, the Education Minister.
He's responsible for both Sameera's
death and this college's suffering.
When you headed to the
court to file the petition,
...they planned to
assassinate you on the way.
I left with them and
finished them all.
You're behind the growth
of this college...
And with you, lies the growth
of thousands of students.
Safeguard our college sir.
Close the gates.
Sir?
Govind...
Let's discuss the
college matters tomorrow.
I need sometime.
I'm not in a good mood.
I'm here to discuss
relationships.
You and Yuvaraj, share the
relationship of a Guru and a disciple.
His relationship with the college
is that of a mother and son.
What transpired in the college
was something else.
Sir, please!
Let me go.
Let her go! Open the door!
- Sir!
In a bid to prove
myself as a good man.
Please don't ruin the life of the girl
and taint the college's reputation.
If people learn that a lecturer
like him exists in our college...
The public will look
down on our college.
Be it the disciple or the Guru, when one
betrays the other, it is wrong, right?
You misjudged him
since that incident.
You kept him away for
failing in his exams.
You were biased to him.
Yet he never let it bother him.
He came back for you
and this college.
He's not a Rogue,
or a Hooligan like you assumed him to be.
He's the ringmaster of all the
rogues and hooligans...
A man who is highly sought out
by colleges across Karnataka...
He's the Youth Icon of Karnataka
- A Professor.
I read about him in the papers.
I learn that when the 'Justice
for Sameera' petition in Mangaluru was
...opposed by St.
Joseph college and the local rowdies,
...he was the Student Union
Leader who stood by the students.
When he was told of the situation in
our college, he abandoned his career.
Yuvaraj is the lead of
the Anti-Drugs Squad.
He had worked against drug trafficking
in all the colleges he served for.
He had conducted a sting operation
in Goa before coming to our college.
Wherever drugs were being
peddled in the college,
...he replaced them
with anti-drug pills.
He sent the students into rehabilitation
and helped them overcome their addiction.
I'm sorry.
There's always a reason
behind one's anger.
But I didn't bother
looking for it.
When you were a student, you protected the
college by picking a row with the bad guys.
And you came back as a student,
to protect the reputation of the college.
Hereafter, you'll have to protect
this college - officially.
Report to the college
from tomorrow.
I now know who you are.
There are others who
need to learn about you.
See you.
He's not a sharp shooter or a college
student like you assumed him to be.
Neither is he Shetty's
aide like we asked for.
He became one of us and
in the end he f@#$@# us up!
Who is he?
Who the hell is he?!
- A Professor!
He's a professor.
But you guys...
A tenth standard
failed student...
You discontinued your II PUC...
And you bought your college
degree using your influence.
When men like you can deceive...
You don't think him,
a man from a middle class family...
Someone who took his
studies seriously...
Someone who turned his
education into his accomplishment
...and his marks
into his identity.
And despite failing, he faced the
society, kicked the insults
...thrown at him and
stood tall among you all.
You don't think he can deceive you?
The public doesn't know that
you're a tenth grade fail.
Neither do they know that you're
failing merit students and killing them.
And he'll make sure they...
- Relax Master!
Do you think you're
running the Indian Army?
It's a college after all.
Clearly you have no idea
about the power of students.
And the power with me...
...is my student.
Don't you dare provoke a
Tiger, Annayya (Elder brother)!
It'll hunt you down!
Younger brother!
I'm not going to call
myself a Lion or a Tiger.
I'm a lot more powerful.
I'm a human.
An educated human.
Do as you please.
I'll see you bro!
You never learnt in your
school or college days.
He'll teach you.
The Devil is back!
The Principal has appointed him to
set things straight in this college.
He's furious against wrongdoings,
yet is a man of honour.
In the near future,
he'll surely take everyone to task.
Hello!
- Hello sir.
Namaskara and I wish
you all a Good Morning!
He's an alumni of this college and
is the newly appointed professor.
Some people don't need an introduction,
only information will suffice.
Hi...
Arjun, I didn't see you around
in college after the brawl.
I thought the Principal
rusticated you.
I left this college as a student.
But I'm back.
As a professor in this college.
By the way, I'm not Arjun.
I'm Raj... Yuvaraj!
Neither could I tell you some things,
nor could I ask you about any.
I joined here as a
student on an operation.
The Operation was successful.
All these days,
you were a lecturer and I was a student.
There was a huge
generation gap between us.
And now,
nothing can come between us.
Whenever we bump into each
other, spot each other. We can...
We can talk and
spend time together.
It'll take you a while
to get out of this shock.
So please take your time.
Doctor...
Always your patient, Yuvaraj.
Are you really a lecturer?
You look like a student.
What do I do madam?
My brother and I.. We never age.
Here's a list of this..
- Hi sir.
Welcome Professor.
- Thank you sir.
Before I begin with lectures,
I have a special lecture for some.
As you wish.
- Thank you sir.
Without enquiring their whereabouts, you've
admitted many wrong people, including me.
I want to know about all
those who were allowed in.
Care to join me?
Go ahead.
- Sir...
I've to bear the brunt.
- Come on.
It's time for a surgical strike.
Excuse me madam?
- Yes?
The three of you.
Get up and come
out of your seats!
Why are you guys standing?
Be seated!
You might be a Professor to this college.
Not to us.
You've been one of us, right?
You know about us, don't you?
You.. Come right now!
And if I don't?
Do you have the guts?
You're going to hit me, huh?
My guts..?!
- Come to...
Pick him up and follow me.
Come over!
Don't you dare!
Don't mess with me.
My father's a Corporator.
I'll make you disappear.
A Corporator?
Which ward is he from?
I'll take you right inside
your ward and smack you!
You think you can throw a fit just because
your dad's a Corporator or an MLA?!
If you and father can get this cocky
for winning by bribing the public...
The very public have paid
and bestowed victory upon us.
Imagine how cocky we can get!
What shampoo do
you apply to your hair?
Shikakai, huh?!
Goddamn, look at them!
You... Come here!
Get in the van.
I'll get you all
quarantined in the prison!
Right! Get moving!
Must be a senior officer!
- Is that Annamalai?!
Annamalai left the
department long ago.
All of them are phony students!
I've got them along
with the evidence.
Book cases on them as per
IPC sections 463 and 464.
Okay sir.
- Sir, we're innocent. Let us go!
We've not committed
anything wrong!
Give one to sir. Go on!
- Okay sir.
Dolly Alias Devanand.
- And you.. What's your name?
Tannery Road Thyagi.
Sir, your cup of tea.
[ROWDY] This isn't just a collar,
but a high voltage wire!
These idiots have been
spoiled by cinema!
Why blame Cinema?
Films have asked people to
walk away from Rowdyism.
Films have shown cops arresting family
when it comes to doing the right thing.
Films have even asked children not to
abandon their parents into old age homes.
Why don't you follow any of this?
The good and bad doesn't
depend on what is shown.
It depends on what we perceive.
Remember that!
Want some tea?
Senior officer's here.
He's waiting. Please come!
Dude!
Do you know the officer well?
Officer?!
What case have you
gotten yourself into?
Sir, he's a Police officer.
I'm not a cop like you think.
I'm a Professor!
Professor?!
This goon's a Professor now?!
Sir, did you appoint
him as a Professor?
How did you do that?
My Dear Professor!
- Hello Mr. Collector!
A teacher needs to know
all of the 64 arts.
He knows them all.
He knows to sing and dance.
Also makes people sing
and dance to his tunes.
He's brave and infuses
bravery in everyone.
So happy for you Yuvaraj.
The one who was scolding you
is singing praises about you.
That is called success.
Thank you!
- Sir, how about a selfie?
Sure, why not?
R K University is not a
safe space for students.
If drugs are doing rounds
in a Government college,
...Principal Gurudev
Deshmukh is to be blamed.
In the pretext of a protest,
he joined hands with
...Private colleges and ruined
the lives of his students.
Here are his digital
signatures on all the scams.
Gurudev Deshmukh is
responsible for Sameera's death
...and for my exit
from the college.
The condition of students in
R K University is tragic.
Save the poor students from the
criminal, Gurudev Deshmukh.
Please!
We have a legal
notice from the Court.
The college has been locked down.
Move from here!
Sir, if you throw all these students
out, what will happen to their future?
We're just following our orders.
Get out of here. Quick!
What lies next in the lives
of these poor students?
[NEWS REPORT] Will R K University
see light of the day again?
What does future hold
for these students?
Sir, we can leave now.
Sir, a notice has been
issued by this board.
R K University, a Government
college has been closed alleging
Lack of Infrastructure,
Misuse of funds,
Passive silence on drugs and drug
addiction in the college premises.
...among other allegations.
I'm not here to
defend my college.
I'm here to seek justice on behalf of the
students who study in Government colleges.
Majority of our students
are of the middle class,
lower-middle class and
labour class background.
Education is already a
far-fetched dream for them.
It shouldn't become
an impossibility.
In the last one year, 56 Government
colleges have been shut down.
Corporations are denying
the Right to Education.
If colleges continue to shut
down, parents will be helpless
...regarding where to
educate their children.
Education should be valued.
It shouldn't come
with a price tag.
Privatisation of Education attaches
a price to every letter learned.
It will not value the student.
The society should get rid
of the mindset of wanting
...Government jobs but
dismissing Government Education.
No student has ever failed because
of a damaged bench in the classroom.
Those who drafted the
Constitution, framed the syllabus,
...scientists, esteemed writers and poets
have all studied in Government colleges.
Without Public education,
neither would you
...be sitting there,
nor would I be standing here.
I'll fight the allegations
against me in the court.
Court procedures will take time and that
shouldn't cause trouble to the students.
If proven guilty, I will...
I will stay away
from this college.
Don't keep my students
away from the college.
Please...
Hello Professor Yuvaraj!
Heard you've sought permission
to reopen the college.
The board might grant
it, but I will not.
Hereafter, your college students
will be mercilessly tortured.
There will be
countless abductions!
Lecturers will leave for
college, but won't make it.
Students will leave for their
homes, but won't make it.
You've provoked a criminal,
crime is bound to follow.
You now have two options.
Either fall at my legs,
or tear my limbs apart.
Where did he go? Find him!
Come to me!
All that mass you're strutting comes from
your protein and vitamin supplements.
I was born with
this mass appeal.
A country needs a soldier
A civilization needs a farmer
And life is incomplete
without a Guru
For he instils the letter in us
Eliminates the ignorance in us
He is indeed our provider
Righting our wrongs
Imparting wisdom to us
This is the path of
our enlightenment
No matter how far you go
Lest you forget your roots
The advent of your
success is here
Paatashaala [The School]
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
A country needs a soldier
A civilization needs a farmer
And life is incomplete
without a Guru
For he instils the letter in us
Eliminates the ignorance in us
He is indeed our provider
We don't abandon our fathers
for not earning well.
We don't abandon our
mothers if they're unwell.
We don't abandon our friends
for not being successful.
Our college had our
backs when we failed.
When our college fails,
it's our turn to stand with it.
I'm Professor Yuvaraj.
I graduated from R K University.
It is here we learned
to express ourselves
It is here we wilfully
took our strides
It is here we walked
towards our dreams
It is here our friends
showered all the love on us
Everyoneâ€™s equal in here,
for prejudice has no place here
When the hunger to learn exists,
there is no beginning or end to it
Our homes are our first schools
Our mothers - our first teacher
Our mothers too learned from the one
- The Guru
Our land believes education
is the greatest of all charity
Such is our country,
a visionary one
We need to have a goal ahead of
us, and a Guru having our back
Trust and tread forward,
life will indeed be fulfilling
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
I graduated with R K University.
Although it was my parents
who brought me to this world,
It was my college and my Gurus
who introduced me to this world.
I graduated from R K University.
It is here we learnt
to come together
It is here we shared our bites
It is here we learnt
to bow to the elders
It is here we learned
the way of life
Education isnâ€™t punishment; but
a charm that will protect us
The hand that holds the book; holds
the blueprint to the right path
The hard earned money of
our parents helps us prosper
The patience of a Guru
helps us write our destiny.
It is our providers who
endure the hardships of money
While those hungry for
education, know no such thing
Marks and Degrees
donâ€™t define success
The morals and values we possess,
will make us undefeatable
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
Paatashaala!
I'm Shathrugan Salimath.
I'm the investigation officer appointed
by NAAC and AICTE board of India.
This is the Inspection
notice from the board.
You've been granted a semester's
time to run this college.
However some conditions
need to be fulfilled.
College Infrastructure
and faculty.
Academic performance.
Overall Excellence in Sports
and Cultural activities
...with cent percent
attendance and results.
Even if one of these
criteria remain unfulfilled,
...the board has decided to pull
the shutters on this college.
If I come across any form of
drugs or criminal activities,
I will have the college
closed right there.
I'll have to inspect the present
condition of the college.
Maybe if you give these
books to a scrap dealer,
...we might be able to raise
some funds for the college.
Namaskara sir!
- What is this?!
Erm.. This is a classroom.
- Looks like a cowshed to me!
You.. Wake up!
Perfect place to binge and
fall into a deep slumber!
Where are we heading now?
- To the Engineering block sir.
Your college is in
a great condition.
Looks like a student has been
sneaking in for some fun.
Students have 1.5GB
of free daily data.
They'll have fun
on their mobiles.
This isn't the job of your students.
Must be one of your staff members.
Today's youth won't have
such deplorable taste.
He'll take another ten
minutes to take off his shirt.
Your college is as empty as
Karnataka was during the pandemic.
Till date,
I've shut down 49 colleges and
...you've worked
for 49 long years.
Time won't decide who'll hit
half century first, I will.
He nit-picks and finds faults in
everything without even looking at it.
All he wants to do is
shut this college down.
Shathrugan Salimath is in.
As an Investigation officer,
he'll do our job for us.
He'll surely shut
the college down.
He has already pulled the shutters
on many Government colleges.
Good Morning Sir! [IN UNISON]
Keep walking.
Professor's here.
- Morning sir.
Wake up. The Professor's here.
Good Morning Sir!
- Good Morning
The strength of
this class is 78.
The strength of this class is 78!
Am I right?!
Yes sir.
But it's only us who regularly
attend the Maths class.
Post-break no one
attends the classes.
They bunk the classes together.
One by two coffee for me, please.
- Sure sir.
All those who bunked the
Engineering Maths class.
Raise your hands.
Move to this row. Keep moving.
What's happening?
Come fast.
Once I pull the shutters,
this is what their future will look like.
I learnt that eighty percent
of my students are here.
I want my first maths
class to be full.
So, I'm here.
I'm used to a Houseful crowd.
Okay?
Eigenvalues.
A very simple topic in Mathematics.
I'm done with the theory.
Let's solve the problems together.
This is utter nonsense!
- Thank you.
The other half?
- Give it to madam.
And bill it to my account.
If only our teachers too had
come to us and taught us,
...all of us would
have prospered in life.
You'll have your lessons here.
Enough practising multiplication.
Time to learn more.
About the attendance.
- Improve...
Nonsense.
I need a minute to
do my number one.
There'll be some
students in there too.
No right? We're not going in.
You shouldn't bother someone
who's kissing or pissing.
The producer of
OM is right there.
I LOVE YOU [POPULAR
TRACK FROM OM]
YOU MUST LOVE ME...
In another ten minutes,
the second half of the film will begin.
By then I'll write down
the important topics.
Read it up.
If you've any doubts...
Feel free to ask me in college or
class, I'm available anytime.
Sir...
- Thank you.
Dude, that's your father...
Dad...?
You'd told me that you're
a manager at a restaurant.
Is this where you work?
In the theatre?
Come home in the evening.
We'll talk.
Shocked to see your
father working here?
He too would've been
shocked to see you here.
He believes you're
in the college.
You believe that he's a
manager at a restaurant.
His place of work might be a lie.
But his intentions are not false.
But his belief of you being
in the college, is a lie.
He hid his workplace because he didn't want
his son to know the hardships he faces.
Not because he's ashamed of it.
Your parents too work
hard to earn money.
They never talk about
their hardships with you.
That's a branded t-shirt, right?
Must have cost you what,
two thousand bucks?
They got it because you asked for
it, even if they couldn't afford it.
Hasn't it been over a year since
your father got a new footwear?
Any idea at all,
what the size of his footwear is?
None of you know about the
troubles they go through.
The medicines they take,
the pressures they face
...and their commitments,
are all alien to you.
Your attendance is the answer
to the trust they have in you.
Only when they work hard and pay the
fee will the college pay my salary.
Shouldn't I be loyal to
the hardships they face?
That is why I'm here.
The movie will
start anytime now.
The money spent on the
ticket is hard-earned too.
Go ahead. Don't waste it.
Good Morning Sir. - Huh?!
Morning sir!
Take your seats everyone.
I'll meet you at the coaching.
- Sir...
The class is full.
Start with your lecture.
Weren't you deducting
points until now?
Time to add points from today.
Look around you!
Animals are superior in morals,
Man is beneath them all.
He refuses to be a kind being...
It was my father who
wrote this song...
And it was my father
who sang the song...
Good Morning Sir [IN UNISON]
- Good Morning.
Today's Friday sir.
Six movies have released in the theatres.
But it is our college
that is Houseful.
You heard it right.
We've made History.
History classes too are fully packed.
All thanks to Professor
Raj's actions.
Guys in the last bench.
Move to the front.
You guys move to the last bench.
Sit in the front,
and all you'll see is the black board.
Move to the last bench,
and you'll see the whole world.
One needs to have knowledge
and awareness of this world.
Are you saying that
we have no knowledge?!
You're absolutely right.
Don't wipe it off sir.
I didn't understand
what madam taught us.
I'll copy it down in my notes.
Quit playing PUBG
and you'll get it.
It's not that sir.
I'm a Kannada medium student.
I didn't quiet
catch her English.
Fine.
I'll teach you in Kannada.
Pay attention.
Let's consider this chalk
piece is a beam structure.
If you squeeze it on both the sides,
it's called compression stress.
If you stretch and add tension on both
the sides, it's called tensile stress.
I understood it perfectly sir.
Madam, could you explain
it in Kannada once?
Everyone in this class
understands English.
I can't explain it in
Kannada just for one guy.
When the Maths professor
can, why can't you?
I can't teach with students like
you guys in the first bench.
But why, sir?
It's no big deal to help
distinction students score ranks.
The challenge lies in helping below
average students gain distinction.
Give it a try sir! - Idiot!
If everything is taught in
Kannada, how will they progress?
If they prefer Kannada,
Kannada is what they should be taught in.
English is merely a language,
not a measure of Knowledge.
Sorry sir.
What are you looking at?
Go play with them.
Yuvaraj, half of your students
are unfit to donate blood.
They're drunk.
Woah Madam! Don't you doubt me.
Millions have worshipped
and adored this bloodline.
Preserve it with care.
It's extremely valuable.
Where's my apple?
Have fun.
But with your own money,
not with your parents' money.
If you lose a girl,
make way for another one.
Like you do for your
Supplementary exam.
Did you come looking for me?
- Yes.
Did you not mock me about
my dove flying away?
The dove will always return to
where it belongs. On my shoulder.
Got it Mr. Curls?!
There once lived a
King in his kingdom
The King had a Queen
If the duo decides to marry, life will
be an ecstatic blend of Milk and Honey
A marriage is like a Maruthi Van;
All that transpires inside is chaos
Make way for the rest of
the family to join the ride
Quick!
Hurry and book a wedding hall
Make some noise at the
reception with the orchestra
All those freeloaders who get on
the state grooving to the music
Yet wish the couple empty
handed are heartless people
There once lived a
King in his kingdom
The King had a Queen
If the duo decides to marry, life will
be an ecstatic blend of Milk and Honey
A marriage is like a Maruthi Van;
All that follow inside it is chaos
Make way for the rest of
the family to join the ride
Come honeymoon and the groom
turns into a romantic hero
Come family matters and he
turns into an action star
Life is fun when both love
and war is on the table
If it's your wife's birthday,
it's time for a holiday; make no mistake
Donâ€™t we leave our
parents behind for you?
And yet you canâ€™t let
go of booze and boys?!
Think before you tie the knots
For it brings no good
to marry in haste
They've intentionally scheduled all our
matches against theirs in the tournament..
They're going all the way
to defeat us on the field.
Our win should be a fitting
reply to them and this society.
Make sure...
You rise against all odds.
Never ever give up!
Get lost from here.
Manju, we're selecting the team
for the Girls' Kho Kho team.
Send the boys away.
- Madam...?
You think these guys cared for
Tennis when Sania Mirza was playing?
Send them out! - Okay madam.
Leave the place!
- Come on girls!
For years, our college has
been the Cricket Champions.
This is a very
prestigious tournament!
So, give it your best.
Pick your team. - Yes sir.
Sir...
We already have a team.
Didn't you tell him about us?
Our Engineering team
is strong enough, sir.
Why should we play with these
...good-for-nothing
degree students?
Sir, why should we play
with these Mechanics,
Computer Operators
and Contractors?
The roads are full of them.
And they're all driving cabs
with no other job to do.
Yet there's no dearth of pride!
Sir, we're Medical students.
They're all our patients.
How can we team up with
them, sir?
Scumbags!
You're supposed to treat patients.
Not like doctors
operate only on doctors!
Varun! Leave it!
Sir, either the Engineering
team gets to play exclusively.
Or else we're not playing.
He's right!
We will not be playing.
We're also not going to play!
- Not like we care either!
This is an Inter-college
tournament.
Not your Intra-college
tournament.
You've to represent the college,
not your individual branches.
Clearly you don't
care for the college.
Either let go of these petty
differences and play for your college.
Otherwise, you're all out!
Dude, come back!
Mister!
You could've convinced them
and formed a team, right?
This team will be a random mix of
players with different mindsets.
They'll spoil the
sport with their egos.
Owing to attendance issues,
students hardly turn up.
You sent away those who
were willing to play.
I'm the Sports HOD for namesake.
Forget about the sports selections.
Sir, we've to attend the
sports practice sessions.
If you fall short on attendance, hall
ticket for your exams will not be given.
Yuvaraj sir will take care of that.
- What?
Hello everyone.
- Good Morning Sir.
I'm Inspector Azad,
an alumnus of this college
...and a State level
Kabbaddi player.
I've voluntarily come
to coach your team.
All the very best!
- Thank you sir.
Cover him!
Get hold of him!
Hope the practice sessions are going well.
- Yes sir.
Except for Cricket.
The players come to the
grounds but don't practice.
Sir, all the other sport teams are
practising, what about Cricket?
Let them be dude!
Tell me sir.
The Cricket team's ready.
- Sir, what are you saying?
What are the girls doing here?
Huh?!
The girl's team?!
But how?
Don't doubt them boy!
We have women who can drive
BMTC buses in the city today,
Cricket will be a
cake walk for them.
Piece of cake!
They're participating in various
cultural and sports activities.
They'll play Cricket too.
For their college.
Don't worry.
Girls are great at multitasking!
You...
have to coach the Girls' team.
Cricket is my passion sir.
Doesn't matter if I
don't get to play.
Our college should win.
I'll coach them sir.
- That's the spirit!
Mister! Instead of using all
those prepared players...
You want these girls to play?
What qualities did
you see in them?!
They revere their college.
They're spirited enough to
be sportive in the games.
Girls practice well.
Madam, whether it's the boys or the
girls, the cup remains the same.
This time, the cup is ours!
- Sure sir!
Bullshit!
This should be your footwork...
Hold the seam like this...
These girls couldn't stand each other
in their own homes during lockdown.
...and they expect eleven
of them to play Cricket?
Women are strong,
but can easily be wronged.
You should be setting the
trend, not follow it.
A real guru leads his students to
the right path, not mislead them.
Your college has hundreds of students.
A couple of failures won't matter.
I only have one son.
Don't sacrifice the lives of
our children for your college.
Even if parents fail
to correct their children,
...a Guru is trusted to do their job.
And what are you doing?!
Forty students in this batch stand
no chance of clearing their exams.
Your son and your
daughter is one of them.
You know your children
are weak in Maths.
There's no point in
encouraging them
...to take part in cultural
and sports activities.
They'll lose their way.
Only you can save your children
from Professor Yuvaraj.
All these trophies were
won a couple of years ago.
Sir, you promised attendance
and encouraged students to
...take part in extra-curricular
activities, right?
Their parents are here
and are opposing it.
It's enough if my son
studies and passes his exam.
There's no need
for him to dance.
We strive at our jobs,
at bringing them up and to pay their fees.
My daughter shouldn't be singing.
Let her study.
Is it enough to pay the fees?
Can't you help them study?
Do you expect us
to study with them?
We could never study.
Our kids will have to.
Our children should listen to us.
We conceived them.
And we bred them.
Damn! What are you guys saying?
Lady, you conceived them.
Sir, you bred them.
Don't mix up things at your whim!
Children of today are of no use.
They have no sense of responsibility.
All they do is watch movies and
roam around with their friends.
What were you up to
in your college days?
Did you never bunk your classes?
You've had your share
of fun in your youth,
...but stop your
kids from having fun.
Isn't that unfair?
If our kids fail tomorrow,
you're responsible.
When ones tries to learn
something that is beyond them,
...one is bound to fail.
Just like you guys did.
We failed or quit studies because
we didn't have anyone to support us.
Not because we
weren't capable of it.
We will fare better
than our kids ever would.
We understand the value
of life better than them.
She's right. [IN UNSION]
- Go on then!
If you're interested,
I'll help you study.
Education doesn't have an age limit.
What do you mean?!
Are you underestimating us?!
What he means to say is...
- We will study and pass the test!
If we study and get through the test,
you shouldn't mess with our kids.
Now you're talking!
It's Parents V/S Children now!
Join us. Study well.
You'll understand today's education
system and the pressure it comes with.
Not like we haven't faced
enough pressure in our lives.
Even if one of us
manages to pass,
...you should never meddle in
the lives of our children again.
And if we fail,
we will not question your methods.
What do you have to say?
- Yes. She's right [IN UNISON]
Mr. Kanteerava.
Get them enrolled in our evening college.
Sir, but how will they...
Okay everyone.
See you in college.
What?!
- Does he really expect us to come?
What is he doing!?
- What just happened?
The puppet master got tired of
the act and ended the performance.
Oh lord! Poor them!
Do you have change
for two hundred bucks?
Madam, aren't we classmates?
Why bring money in between?
It's okay. Let's go.
Namaste
- Namaskara...
I'm from Sringeri...
- And I'm from Kengeri!
cosÎ¸+isinÎ¸...
I was hoping to learn about adding,
subtracting and dividing in Mathematics.
What in the hell is Theta?
This is exactly what
our kids are studying.
Excuse me?
I couldn't manage to catch the
show, 'Nandini' last night.
Five minutes and I'll
skim through the show.
You write it down.
I'll copy it from you later.
This is an important topic.
Please make note of it.
He's the security
guard of my company.
He's doing the exact job
he does back at work.
Sir?
Sir...?
- Master!
This is an important topic.
Make note of it.
We asked him to mould our children,
and this guy's onto grinding us.
Like we've been thrown
into a grinding stone!
You've dissolved a
Champion Cricket team and
...are making the girls
represent our college.
You've pushed parents
into classrooms and
...have granted attendance
to those bunking classes.
What's happening here?
Everything is normal sir.
If there's no team spirit,
Champions are no less than losers.
The girls are very spirited.
I'm granting attendance only
to those who are interested
...in sports and culture
activities but lack support.
Parents need to
understand their children.
The interested ones will
study no matter what.
And we side-line those who
don't study as failures.
Every one of us has been blessed
with a unique capability.
As teachers, it's our job to
identify, encourage and shape them.
If the world shunned those who
didn't have formal education...
Where would Gavaskar, Tendulkar,
P.B.Srinivas,
S.P.Balasubramaniam,
Puttanna Kanagal,
Kuvempu, Dr. Rajkumar go?
Without them our childhood
would have been meaningless.
Failure in examinations don't matter,
but one shouldn't fail in life, sir.
From giving birth to getting them to
study, our struggle is real.
I don't know about the others,
but we shouldn't give up on our children.
You're right.
Sir, my Sun sign is Virgo.
- And my Sun sign's the same as yours.
Looks like the priest's
prayers will be answered soon!
Dude, look!
You never managed to woo Pooja.
And now, looks like your
dad's winning over her mother.
Here's my childhood photo.
Let's say your dad's
successful in wooing her,
forget your chances
of hitting on Pooja.
Time to call her as your sister.
- What?!
[CROWD MURMURING]
I'll help you perform
the holy rituals!
Sit down. He's here.
Dear Tailor, let me find my perfect fit.
Thank you.
Write it down guys!
Make a note!
I'll ride all the way to
K.R.Puram and Whitefield twice.
I'll wait in the Silk board
traffic for four hours.
But this? No can do.
You can easily score fifteen
marks from this topic.
Study in your homes.
Your kids have been informed.
They'll help you out.
Dad, please start studying.
Five hundreds episodes
and the show...
Mom, they'll gain TRP from all
the time you spend on the shows.
We'll lose our value.
They're all degree holders.
Aunty,
please put some sense into her.
Dad, I hope you're studying!
Son, I really am studying.
Look...
Your father and I are
studying together.
Looks like he's
having a great ride.
I slipped in the bathroom
thinking of you... [POPULAR SONG]
I slipped into love...
I landed on the bed...
Dad, I'm the one who's
supposed to be singing.
You're supposed to be studying.
If you don't want me to sing,
you shouldn't be loafing around.
Take this and get
back to studying.
Dear... Keep this peacock
feather in the book.
You'll do well in the test.
He's been plucking the chords all day!
Good Lord!
Open up! Why are you
torturing me like this?!
Dad, an hour more and
I'll open the door.
You have a test coming
up in three days.
Please study!
This Mathematics is
screwing me over!
[MUMBLES IN SLEEP]
Going by the challenge,
you will take your tests tomorrow.
Your worth will be decided
in tomorrow's test.
What the hell are you saying?
Are you going to measure our
worth with your petty test?!
Are you telling us that
we've failed in life
...just because we didn't learn
a couple of lessons you taught us?
It's true that I wanted
to be an Engineer...
But I couldn't.
Instead... I started a grocery
store and earned millions.
How am I not worthy enough?!
Your textbooks are unfit
to measure our worth.
It will never come
close to my Almanac.
How the hell will you
ascertain our value through
...a puny test or a three
hour long examination?
Tell me... Can you sing
classical music like I can?
You think you can whip up
delicious dishes like I can?
Can you stitch clothes
to perfection like I can?
We took up this challenge
to ensure our kids study.
And you think you can decide
if we're worthy or not?
Your tests or exam can never help nurture
the worth or capabilities of others.
Yes! Indeed! [IN UNISON]
You told me the very things
I wanted to tell you.
There's a musician in your child.
Maths doesn't matter to him.
There's an entrepreneur
in your child.
English literature
is of no use to him.
There's a dancer among your kids.
Chemistry serves no purpose to her.
There are athletes
among your kids.
They need physical fitness.
Not theories of Physics.
Sure it's great for them
if they score good marks.
But if they don't, make sure you
don't crush their self-confidence.
Don't judge them.
You're banking on the dreams
you've imposed on your kids.
I'm banking on their aspirations.
With the pretext of exams,
don't push them away from their dreams.
You send your kids to coaching classes
believing they play or sing well.
When it's time for their SSLC exams,
you cut them off from everything.
It is you who plant the dream in
them, and unearth it.
If you don't trust your
kids, this world won't.
What do you want to become?
- Dad, I want to become a dancer.
Fine. Dance your heart out!
I know someone who
works in Udaya TV.
I'll talk to him and
get you an opportunity.
Okay dad.
- Achieve your goals. Don't give up!
Son, I've never cheated
a passenger in my life.
But my passengers
have given me a life.
Order the equipment you
need for practice on Amazon.
Madam, it's getting late.
Get your daughter and
I'll drop you gals home.
You don't worry.
Do as your hearts says.
I wanted you to study and not end
up as a security guard like me.
But go become whatever you want.
I'll guard your
office with my life.
Let's go son.
- Thank you dad.
It's okay.
Mom, thank you for
being understanding.
Just a minute. Hello?
Seek her blessings too...
- Dad? Poo..?!
Bless you.
Book tomorrow's slot on
FM Radio for my daughter.
Come morning and we'll
be at the FM station.
My daughter's going
to become a singer.
Even kids will chase this puny target in
minutes.
I wouldn't have played if I knew
we were playing against girls.
These girls screwed our
college's reputation.
If only they'd let us play...
- What a dreadful loss!
You pit our girls against
professional cricketers!
What are you trying to prove?
Are you trying to bring shame
to our girls and our college?
Why did you pit the
girls against the boys?
Why in the hell did we come
to play with such players?
Looks like there are
no men in this college!
Let me show you what
it is to face a man!
Stop! Get back all of you!
Get back. Behave yourselves.
Move. Go back now!
Show us what you're made of.
On the field!
We'll hit you where it hurts!
- Enough!
Please sir.
Give us a chance to play!
They're demeaning our college!
Please sir!
- Sir...
We'll play for our college.
Let us play!
This is no Engineering
or Medical tournament.
It's a college tournament.
We'll play as a team sir!
We'll not dishonour our college!
Please let us play!
Yes sir. We'll play as a team.
It's a promise sir.
Please let us show it to them!
Okay. Go form your team!
Men are egoistic.
All you have to do is rake it up!
Arise and Awake
Go on and become your dream
Reach your Goal, Oâ€™ Yuva (Youth)
Hustle! Storm ahead!
Become your own army
Let go of your fears, Oâ€™ Yuva
You gotta keep winning
until your last breath
And you gotta last until
you emerge victorious
You are your own inspiration
Trust yourself and go ahead
Make a name for yourself that
will leave a lasting impact
A name that will
live on forever
Become the preface of History
Shout out loud
This is the Power of Youth
Power of Youth
Power of Youth
Power of Youth
No matter what the challenge is
No matter from who
the challenge is
Face your opponent!
Donâ€™t ever turn
your back, Oâ€™ Yuva
Victory is nobodyâ€™s priced possession
Success doesn't belong to one man
Work hard and good days will be
yours, keep surging ahead Oâ€™ Yuva
Hey Yuva Yuva!
Walk with your collar high,
amidst those who mocked you
Hey Yuva Yuva!
Become the display picture in the
phones of those who doubted you
You gotta keep winning
until your last breath
And you gotta last until
you emerge victorious
Stay determined and kill those
who ridiculed you, with a smile
Power Of Youth
Power Of Youth
Power Of Youth
Those who do nothing but comment,
have nothing better to do in their lives
Pay no attention to such brickbats
For they stand nowhere in
comparison to you
Hey Yuva Yuva!
Letâ€™s keep those waiting for us to fail,
waiting forever
Hey Yuva Yuva!
Even if we fail the examinations,
letâ€™s build a great life
Make a name for yourself
that will leave a lasting impact
A name that will live on forever
Become the preface of History
Shout out loud
This is the Power of Youth!

We welcome Bengaluru's DC,
Samarth Bhagwat, to the Semi-finals
Kabbaddi match of the Karnataka
State University Championship.
Azad...?
They're dehydrated!
Here's some Glucose
Kabbaddi...
- Come on boys!
What are you doing?!
- Let go of him!
Yuvaraj! Stop them!
Sharath! Don't do it...
Let go of me!
I will not spare you!
BREAKING NEWS: An untowardly incident
took place at the Karnataka State
University Championship Kabbaddi
Tournament during the match.
The players seemed to have
consumed drugs during the breaks
and we have now found the visuals of the
players physically attacking the opponents.
R K University's Kabbaddi players
and team have been disqualified
...from the Karnataka
State Kabbaddi Championship
RK University's
Kabbaddi team has been
disqualified due to
Narcotic activities.
Time won't decide who'll hit
the half century first, I will.
Rampant Drug Mafia in Government Colleges.
Will RK University face another lockdown?
Trust me! I'm very sure about this.
This is going to be the
breaking news of the day.
Nice to be back in
our hangout place.
It's great to know that you've been
promoted as the new Cabinet Secretariat.
I'm so proud of you Samarth.
You've shown that even those without a
wealthy background one can make it big.
Samarth, let's have a
drink before Sir gets here.
Let's cut the cake too.
Dude...
Samarth cut the cake now!
Thank you!
I miss our college days so much.
- So do we.
Doesn't this place remind
us of our college days?
Our college days were the
best days of our lives.
Look who's finally here!
You missed the champagne.
Have some cake instead.
How could you fail the
college for you to succeed?
You stomped down your own college
to climb up the ladder, didn't you?!
Dude, what are you saying?
Despite not being invited for
the Kabbaddi match you came;
...and I believed that
you were there as an alumni.
But you were there
as Antony Joseph's mole.
You revealed our strategies and strengths,
and ruined our plans, you idiot!
Yuvaraj, are you out of your mind?
- Why did you do this?!
How could you?!
- Let me go, dammit!
Samarth...
- What's happening?
You fraudster...!
How long will you
live on petty deals?
Land acquisition Commission...
Income Tax due fines...
There are bigger fishes to fry!
Help us out and we'll turn
your dreams into your reality.
Or else, your life will
remain as a dream forever.
You haven't taken your
salary in six months,
...yet you have a
car worth a crore.
You became a DC only a year ago,
yet you're the new Cabin Secretariat.
How is this possible?
You came by faking us your
support, and yet you stood by them.
Tell us. Speak up!
What is so wrong about this?!
I haven't committed any sin
for you to pound me like this!
My education gave me a
position and they paid for it.
Success is all that matters in
life, not how you succeeded!
Remember, you too were valued only
after you fit their norms of success.
Marks are all that matters today.
Nobody gives a damn about us.
I was studying well,
so they supported me.
Why didn't they help you
pursue civil services?
Isn't it selfish to support
only those who study well?
They supported me for
their own selfishness.
They had no intention
of helping me out.
What wrong did I do?
Remember your words?
Get educated and Money, Power,
Status and Reputation follows you.
And it followed me.
No book ever taught me to what
money to take and what not to.
No syllabus did.
Not just the books.
Even you didn't bother teaching me that!
If all you care about is your college's
reputation, then all I care about is mine.
All we can do now is target
this Examination building.
This is our last chance.
We now know who their
mole among us was.
They too know that their
cover has been exposed.
They now have only one option.
To disrupt our exam proceedings
and ruin our college's results.
Let the examinations begin.
We'll make sure it
doesn't end successfully.
Ramaiah...
If you doubt someone
when the exams are on.
Ring the bell!
Ring the bell once and I'll
know it's in the ground floor.
Ring the bell twice and I'll
know it's in the first floor.
I'll be there the very next
minute after you ring the bell.
Have the question
papers been segregated?
Are the Degree and Medical papers ready?
- Yes sir!
Show me your ID card.
Take it out!
Quick. You won't be able
to do your exams well!
Is this you?
- Yes sir. This is my ID.
What is your name?
What branch do you study in?
Please return my hall ticket!
- Give me the details!
Excuse me.
You're disturbing the students...
This is my duty. Who are you to ask me?
Show me your ID card!
Sir,
I'm a staff of this college...
Show me the damn ID card!
Don't talk too much!
Show me your ID card!
- Excuse me?
Please don't shout.
You're disturbing the students!
I'm from the Inspection Squad
from the board of Examination.
I have the authority
to check everyone.
I can check yours too.
Show me your ID card!
Show me your damn ID card!
Students!
Continue writing...
Yuvaraj!
What's happening here?
You're not supposed to do this!
Exams are on and he's
our squad member!
Sir, listen to me.
- Yuva...
He was misbehaving with
the lecturer in class!
He was disturbing
the students too.
He is clearly here
to disrupt the exams!
Show me the ID!
Along with him, more men have
come here as a part of the squad.
Yuvaraj!
If the exams are disrupted
and students face disturbance,
...it is a violation
of the board rules.
It might lead to a lockout again.
Sir, I'll make sure the
students don't get disturbed.
You make sure you
don't disturb me.
Let him be in this room.
I've no idea what the others are up to.
If I suspect someone,
I'll get them here.
[MOBILE PHONE RINGS]
I'll pretend to be on inspection.
Be ready.
Madam, I'll be on the first floor.
- Sure sir.
Does anybody want an
additional sheet...?
Is everything fine?
- It is sir.
Things are going fine, right?
- Everything is fine sir.
Are you relaxed thinking
the exams are going well?
Your college and your students will not
make it out of the labyrinth I've created.
By the time I go around this college
once, this college will be in ruins.
Gurudev, you are...!
- Shut up!
This isn't your cabinet or
your constituency to shout!
This is my college!
Silence!
You may misuse your power.
But there's another power here
that can't be messed with!
Protecting this college.
Let me go!
- Take your IDs out...
What are you looking at
morons? Show me...!
What could anyone do to me?
[POPULAR RAJKUMAR SONG]
What peril could anyone put me through?
Nothing can go wrong,
when Iâ€™m on the path of truth
When my principles
are protecting me
When this land has got my back
...and when Kannada is my soul.
The number you have
dialled is not reachable.
How are the exams going on?
- Going well sir.
Inform me if there's anything...
Sir! What's happening?
- There's half an hour more to go!
Sit down!
Ma'am, what's happening?
- Give me a minute. Let me check!
There's still time left!
Sir, I need the additional sheet.
Students, do not panic.
It's the wrong bell.
You still have thirty minutes left.
Quit panicking!
Return their papers to them!
- I will give them. Wait...
Sit down everyone.
- Students! It's a false alarm!
It's a false alarm!
You've got half an hour more.
Concentrate!
Sit down and write the exam!
Give them their papers!
It's a false alarm!
Ma'am, additional sheets?
Fear not students!
They're trying to distract us...
Sir, please give
us our papers back!
Sir, quickly give
them their papers!
Students, concentrate and write!
You will face the consequences!
You're arresting the Education
Minister without any evidence.
I'm proud of you my boy!
Thank you for helping
me with my IAS exams!
God bless you my boy!
Any hint of trouble. Inform me!
Not everyone can get
a Guru like you...
But you should never get
a student like me again!
Please forgive me, sir!
The examination results are out!
Sir...
Yuvaraj!
100% results!
I welcome you all to the Golden
Jubilee anniversary of R K University.
I'm here to confess
something to all of you.
Irrespective of whether you scored
well in your exams or did not do well,
...if ever I have
discriminated and hurt you
Please forgive me.
Education taught without values..
is futile.
No matter how brilliant
a student you are...
No matter how well-educated or
how many ever degrees you hold...
With no values in you,
you'll be corrupted.
You are of no use
to this society.
If education is delivered to students for
the sake of a degree, it's a business.
The very education when delivered to
students as knowledge, it's a service.
Education... is not a business.
It's a service! Thank you.
