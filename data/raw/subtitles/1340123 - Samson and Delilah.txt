He's coming straight here.
I am going to town.
Kitty -

That's good isn't it? Kitty?
I will see you later.
Quickly.
Get up high.
Quickly.
Take them in your hand and eat them.
No.
Quickly, swallow them,
or you will become sick.
In the future, he will...
He will...
I wonder who he's looking for?
Me.
Speak truly.
What's his name?
That one's name is Samson Japanangka.
Look!
That's really good to see.
No.
Go off you two.
Be quiet.
Good one over there.
Yes, yes right skin for you.
Off you go for you.
The two of you talk.
Talk together,
then the two of you go off.
Your eyes are making me laugh.
Your husband!
Samson, come back!
Bring that kangaroo here.
I'm hungry! I'm your brother!
Hey, what about your partner?
Wake up.
Nana.
Come on, wake up.
- You let her get sick!
- That's why we're going to hit you!
Yeah! You never looked after her!
You were running around!
You never looked after
your grandmother!
You now went running around.
You never took her to clinic.
Hey! Someone get a policeman.
What has made you crazy?
For nothing really.
For nothing you have become like this,
running amok and smashing things.
Go on, run over there.
No more for you now, nothing!
No more, nothing for you.
No more.
They are back here.
Hiding away trying not to be seen.
The greedy ones are back who stole the car
that everyone chucked in to buy.
- Yes they have come back.
- His head's no good.
Thieves!
We don't steal other people's things.
Give me room.
His hands I want to hit them!
Go away don't protect him.
Leave me alone.
You have made my stomach upset again.
- Anyway leave it, that's it.
- Don't protect him.
- She is taking him to her own country.
- No, too much you mob disappear with the car.
I am sick of it!
No, too much, you mob disappear with the car
and don't bring it back.
I am sick of it!
We all chucked in
then you took off with it.
- She is taking him to her country.
- No! Go away and keep on going!
Who's here?
What's wrong?
I'll leave a message at the store.
