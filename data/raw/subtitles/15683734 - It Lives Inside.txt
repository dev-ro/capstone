Morning, Mom.
Samidha, I need you to help
me prepare the prasad tonight.
Sure.
Wait. I'm hanging
with Katie later.
Tomorrow, first thing.
Promise.
You can't throw out "kasams"
after everything you say.
Mom, just get it catered
like Deepa Aunty does.
The point is hand-made prasad.
So please, take
it seriously now.
I bet these things were way
more fun when you were a kid.
You know, my sisters and I
used to get new outfits
every day of the puja.
I used to cook with your Nani.
Your Nani cooked with my Nani.
[phone buzzing] And...
The prasad needs to be
ready when the guests come.
I'm not asking again.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Dad! Here you go.
Thank you, Poorna. Sit, sit.
How's the night shift?
I mean, I get to come home
to your mom's food, no?
So... not all bad.
But, tell me...
how is driver's ed?
How long 'til my baby's
a licensed driver?
She failed it again.
Ah-ha...
Well, you know what they say,
they say that, third time is the?
Charm.
This was the third time.
[whistling]
Samidha... Uh, uh, uh...
Samidha, don't whistle.
Evil spirits will hear you.
Please.
- Gotta go.
- Okay.
Love you.
- Love you.
- Love you.
- Samidha...
- Love you.
When will this girl learn?
Samidha! Your lunch!
Samidha
So, Winthrop's City on the Hill
is kind of a normative fantasy.
Like if you set up a society
based on the moral
superiority of its people,
it's gonna be super rigid
and a little homogenous.
Okay. Anyone wanna rebut?
Anyone?
Okay, well let's talk
about the economic
repercussions of this statement.
Winthrop's not saying
this in a vacuum
and he's also dealing with
the unrest on the Arbella
as the settlers are
making this long journey.
[Joyce] So, the piety
of this once rich...
Hey.
Hey Russ.
There's a kickback by the
old golf course on Saturday.
It's BYOB.
I can't.
My mom would blow a fuse
if I missed Puja Day.
What's that?
Uh... So this one,
like, god named Durga
killed this demon, Mahishasura
and every year we
celebrate her victory.
[Joyce]... an economic system,
a labour system that
hasn't quite found its...
bearings.
[Joyce] You're half an
hour late, Tamira, again.
I don't suppose you have
a note for me this time?
Just... just go on,
sit down, please.
[ominous music]
[school bell ringing]
Thank you.
Thank you.
- 'Sup Joyce?
- Ah yes, thank you.
See you tomorrow.
Sam... wait.
What is the deal with Tamira?
Why are you asking me?
The other teachers said
you two used to be close.
I mean... is she
doing alright?
Uh... why wouldn't she be?
I hear the way the
kids talk about her
in the halls and...
she eats her lunch
under the bleachers.
Does she ever tell you anything?
Well we gotta look
after our own, Sam.
Especially when one of
them's falling behind.
Joyce, I really
gotta get to bio.
If she or either of you
are struggling to fit in...
I'm not struggling to fit in.
But if you were...
you could always come
to me for help and...
I know you're good, Sam.
I just wanna make sure we're
looking out for Tamira.
Tamira's a big girl, Joyce.
If she needed help,
she'd probably ask.
Dude... thank you.
My parents would slaughter
me if I got a B in calc.
It's unfair how
easy it is for you.
[shaky breathing]
My stomach seriously drops
every time she, like,
appears out of
thin air like that.
Just so you know,
whatever she's doing,
I'm not against it if it's some
kind of, like, cultural thing.
It's not a cultural thing.
So, um, Russ was asking
about you in health.
[laughs]
Seriously?
He wanted to know if you
spoke another language.
I told him you do.
Hindu.
[laughs]
Hindi.
Say, uh... say Kitty's my
best friend in... in Hindi.
Oh...
Kitty... [speaking in Hindi]
That is so cool.
Hey, let's... let's, uh,
let's get outta here.
Oh, okay.

My mom's been acting
like such a bitch.
I think she's menopausal.
Did you know we're supposed
to end up like our moms
when we're older?
I'd hate to end up like my mom.
What? Your mom
looks like she's 25.
It's not how she
looks, it's how she is.
She's so afraid. You know?
I'll see you later.
[whispers] Hi Samidha.
Hey.
You know you could
just call me Sam now.
Everyone else does.
I need your help.
What... what do you need?
I need to tell you
something and you just...
you have to believe me.
[voices whispering]
Tamira, you look really tired.
How long's it been
since you've slept?
Promise you'll believe me?
Promise.
Kasam?
Mmhmm.
There's something in here.
I know you can't see it
but... it... it lives inside.
Don't you hear it?
Where... where'd you even
get this thing, Tamira?
I found it at his house.
It was saying my name,
calling out to me.
His house? Who's house?
I thought I was strong
enough to keep it inside.
I thought... I thought if
I just fed it but it's...
so hungry all the time and...
all it wants is raw meat.
Tamira...
And it's getting stronger
and I'm not strong enough
to keep it inside
so I need your help.
- Okay, Tamira...
- I need your help!
Okay, okay, okay. I
wanna help you, I do.
So just... calm down. Okay?
And tell me the truth.
What's going on with you?
There's a monster in here.

Please God, don't let them

Remember when the Choudharys
used to come to these things?
What was their deal?
Uh...
When we first met them
we knew there was
something... broken...
about that family.
It's like they were running
from something in India.
Then the boy, Karan...
we all thought he
was a good kid.
Smart. Good future.
And then something changed.
You should have seen that

He was talking to something...

I don't... I don't

Do you remember that, uh...
that Indian kid
who died last year?
Yeah. Uh... he killed
himself, right?
Okay, so... Tamira
had his journal.
I think she found
it at his house...
It looks like he was
burned or something?

Morning, Mom. I...
I need your help.
I think something really
bad is happening to me.
What happened to Tamira?
What did you do, Samidha?
Do you even know why we
celebrate Durga Puja?
We all prayed for
Tamira together.
And that prasad that you
hated making so much...
that was our offering.
For her safety.
For her well-being.
I... I'm sorry for leaving, Mom.
Why don't you bring your
friends home anymore?
And you don't speak
our language anymore.
Do you even remember it?
Of course I do. So then, why?
Why do you want
to be one of them?
Why did you even come here, Mom?
If that's all you
were ever gonna be?
Just another desi housewife
who cooks and cleans.
[thunder crashing]
[Russ] Got it.
You dropped it in the attic.
Thanks.
You good?
I, uh... I lied
about something.
What?
[indiscernible voices]
Tamira was my best friend.
[Samidha] Back
when we were kids.
[Tamira] I found you!
But then we got to high school
and I wanted more friends.
And I told Tamira it was...
it was time for us
to try and fit in.
But she just didn't
wanna grow up.
And... and I could feel
the way people looked at me
when I was with
her and I just...
I just hated it.
I'm not crazy, right?
No. Not at all.
Like, I hate what I did to her.
But after Karan, it was like...
people started looking
at me different.
They didn't...
they didn't see me.
I don't know.
I just didn't
wanna be that girl.
What girl?
Come on, what girl?
You're nothing like Tamira.
I'm sorry.
Uh... I don't mean to keep
going on about my shit.
Was that okay?
Only if you're into it.
Can I, uh... can
I kiss you again?

Yeah, of course. Cross

What's going on?
The cops think an
animal killed Russ.
But I was there.
It wasn't an animal,
it was something else.
Whatever it is... I
think it took Tamira.
Why are you whispering?
It's listening.
Um... tell me again, what
is... what is this thing?
I don't know what it is.
Like sometimes it's there but
then it's not there at all.
And... and it shows me things in
my dreams but they feel so real.
Okay. Sam...
you look like you
haven't slept in days
and lack of sleep can
cause hallucinations...
Joyce... this is real.
It's infected my mind.
It's like everything I wanted
outside of me is inside of me
and I can't get it out.
What... what do you
mean? How can I help you?
That's... what's after me.
I... I looked all over and I...
I... I can't... but I
can't find anything.
There's nothing.
Okay. Text that to me
and I'll look into it.
I'm doing you this
favor, now you do me one.
Just take it easy tonight.
Lay low and tomorrow I'd like
to introduce you to someone...
I'm not crazy.
I know, but you're
also not alone and...
I know it might seem
like there's no one
on the whole planet that gets
you or... is trying to get you.
There are people that love
you that care about you...
[Joyce's voice begins to fade]
Sam?
[Joyce] Sam? Sam?
Are you still with me?
[growling]
[screaming]
[panicked breathing]
[ominous music]
[phone buzzing]
Hey. Are you alright?
You ran off and I
didn't know if I was...
[Samidha] Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay. Well... I heard
back about that painting.
What'd you find?
[Joyce] Look, I'm only telling
you this because you asked.
In East Indian mythology
there's a demonic entity
that feeds on negative energy.
It's called the Pishach.
[Joyce] It's a flesh
eater. A devourer of souls.
You have to trap it in a
vessel, a sort of container,
and then keep it there.
[Samidha] A vessel?
[Joyce] Swamis would sometimes take
on the burden of becoming vessels.
But any container
could be a vessel.
Tamira found it trapped...
trapped inside a jar.
Sam, did you hear these
stories growing up?
From your parents maybe?
[Joyce] Do you think all the
stress from the last few days
has brought these stories back?
- [Samidha] I gotta go.
[Joyce] Hey, hold on. Sam...
Do you need me to come by?
Look... you came
to me for help.
So let me help you.
[Samidha] Yeah.
Okay. Send me your address.
I'll be right there.
[Joyce] Stay safe, Sam.
[crying]
I... I wanna tell
you the truth.
Then, tell me.
You're not gonna believe me.
Samidha, I'm trying.
Talk to me. Please, Sam.
When Tamira and I were kids...
you used to tell us those
stories that the ayahs told you.
What is the Pishach, Mom?
Samidha-
Please... tell me.
The ayah said...
never to sleep with a bad
feeling in our hearts.
Because there's a dark thing
that feeds on those feelings.
Anger... hatred... loneliness.
How?
It needs to...
What's the word?
Tenderize the soul by
attacking your sanity.
By isolating you from
those who love you.
[growling sounds]
And if anyone tries
to help you...
It will hurt them.
I know I sound crazy.
But it's real.
All those stories that the
ayahs told you... they're real.
I think it started with Karan.
Dad said that
family was running.
What if they brought
it back to that house?
And that's where
Tamira found it...
trapped inside the jar.
Could she still be alive, Mom?
The Pishach doesn't
kill you right away.
It eats you slowly over time.
When it's ready...
it eats your soul.
She's been gone since
Thursday, right?
No. Friday.
Seven. Seven days.
Tamira's gonna die tonight, Mom.
What do we... what do we
do? I have to do something.
Samidha...
"If you face a Pishach alone,
you won't come out alive."
Your soul will burn from within
until there's nothing left.
What do we do?
I have to do something, Mom.
What are you doing?
To summon a dark spirit
we must make an offering.
We don't have meat, but
we'll offer what we can.
[sighs]
You can do this.

Karan must've died trapping it
in that jar but he did trap it.
He must've written down how.
I've seen this before.
It's a shanti prayer.
A call for peace from
the stars and seas.
Most importantly within you.
This has to be
it. Read it, Mom.

My mom's been teaching me.
Speaking of...
I gotta get back and help her
with the prasad for the puja.
I worry about you.
You don't have to.

No matter what happens...
it'll never get out again.
We won't let it.
Kasam?
Kasam.
See you tomorrow.
