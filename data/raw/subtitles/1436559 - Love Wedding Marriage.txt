¶ ¶
- Ava, we've been dating
for 2 1 /2 years,
and what I'm about to say,
I've considered very seriousIy.
I sound Iike a Iawyer.
I Iook in your eyes,
and I drown in them.
Drown in them?
Babe, you know I'm bad
with teIIing you how I feeI.
WiII you be my wife?
WiII you marry me?
Can we get married?
Ava.
You can do this.
[sighs]
It's, Iike, the IittIe things
that I reaIIy Iove.
I find it so adorabIe
that you can't make
a decision
without consuIting
your horoscope.
I Iove that you watch the same
sad movie over and over again,
hoping for a happy ending.
I Iove how you make
your coffee.
I Iove you, Ava, and I don't
want to spend another day
without knowing
if you'II be my wife.
So wiII you do me this honor?
WiII you marry me?
¶ ¶
- Brittany, Brittany,
this is Ryan.
Trust me,
you two have a Iot in common.
Good to see you.
Where is Ava?
Go find your sister.

- AII rise.
- Our wedding day was
the happiest day of my life.
l was marrying
the man of my dreams,
and our happily ever after
was about to begin.
Charlie and l met
once upon a time,
when l was getting my PhD
in psychology at Berkeley
and he was working
at a vineyard in Napa.
We fell in love
on the very first date.
He took me to an art fair
in San Francisco.
The next day, he surprised me
with a painting l had admired,
and l was hooked.
l believe lasting love
is possible
because of my parents.
Their 30-year union
is the reason l became
a marriage counselor
and why l was ready to make
the commitment myself.
[gIass shatters]
- MazeI tov!
[appIause]
And that dimpled smile
doesn't hurt.
- So embarrassing.
Thank you.

I Iove you both.
I Iove you both.
I've known him my whoIe Iife,
and I stiII Iove you.
I can't even say that
about anyone eIse,
Iike, not even my own parents.
- Okay, we Iove you too,
Gerber.
- No, Iove, man.
Love.
That's what it's aII about.
You know, from now on,
I'm gonna be
a one-woman guy.
- Per week?
- I'm serious.
Uh, heIIo?
We didn't actuaIIy--
- There he goes.
- SheIby, are you, Iike,
avoiding me?
Come on, we were in the middIe
of taIking about horses.
I Iove horses.
- You ready to get out of here,
Mrs. DaIton?
- I shouId warn you:
I've been saving a few tricks
for the honeymoon.
- Let's go.
- Okay.
[excited chatter]
Ready?
- Yeah!
Oh!
Oh, you got smoked.
In your face.
You got rocked.

- BIack.
Two sugars.
- Two orders,
wheat toast with mayo.
Yum.
- The onIy way to eat toast.
- Your horoscope says,
''Today your positive
mentaI energy
''wiII ensure that everything
goes your way.
Take advantage
of your good Iuck.''
- That's great.
Maybe that means
this year's harvest
wiII be the vineyard's
best vintage ever.
- Fingers crossed.
- How about
you skip out earIy,
take advantage of me tonight?
- Oh, I couId canceI
my Iast coupIe.
- I'II rescheduIe
my afternoon.
- See you at 6:00.
Let's take a minute
to vaIidate those feeIings.
It sounds Iike LIoyd
is feeIing angry
because Courtney took advantage
of his credit card.
- She didn't take advantage
of it.
She raped it.
At Saks.
She roofied it,
bent it over, and--
- Okay.
Courtney raped your credit card.
And Courtney is stiII angry
because you sIept
with another woman.
- ''A sIutty, trashy whore''
were my exact words.
- ObviousIy Courtney stiII
has some unresoIved issues
about the affair.
- But 9 grand on shoes?
- Why shouId I suffer
just because you're not rich
Iike my father?
- If your father's so great,
why didn't you marry him?
- He wasn't avaiIabIe.
- I want you to think back
to when you first met.
What attracted you
to one another?
And I want you to make a Iist
of aII of the quaIities
that made you want
to get married.
The key to a successfuI marriage
is to find those quaIities
that make you faII in Iove
with your spouse
aII over again
every day.
- Oh, I know they're here
somewhere.
Where are they?
Ugh.
- SheIby, what are you doing?
- Where do you keep
aII your stuff?
- What stuff?
- The meds!
- I'm a psychoIogist,
not a psychiatrist.
I can't prescribe meds.
- Jesus, Ava.
That's the onIy reason
I took this job.
- I'm not even sure
they've invented a drug
to begin tackIing your issues.
- Don't judge my pain.
You're my sister.
Can't you at Ieast
refer me to someone?
- If I referred you
to a psychiatrist,
they'd have you committed.
- WouId there be meds invoIved?
- And a straightjacket.
Did you maiI out
those invitations for me?
- For Mom and Dad's
surprise party?
- Yes.
- I got the guest Iist
right here.
- Thank you.
[man and woman
arguing indistinctly]
GIad that's not my next cIient.
[scoffs]
- DarIings.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What was aII the yeIIing about?
- Just your mother's
normaI kvetching.
- Oh, wouId you stop
taIking Iike that?
This isn't a production
of Fiddler On The Roof.
- WouId you just reIax
and stop acting Iike
some kind of meshuggener
in front of our daughters?
- What does that even mean?
Jesus!
- Jewish.
- Okay, can we just take this
into my office, pIease?
Right into my office.
Thank you.
Come on.
AII right.
BradIey, Betty,
why don't you caImIy express
what's upsetting you?
- WeII, I didn't want to have
to teII you this, Ava--
- No, Betty.
Don't teII her.
It'II break her heart.
- I want a divorce.
- What?
- Both of you--
everyone, take a seat.
Ooh, everybody caIm down
and take a breath.
Okay.
Betty, what triggered
this decision?
- Your sack-of-shit father
cheated on me.
- We were separated.
We were separated at the time.
- Yeah, but he stiII managed
to knock me up.
Did we conceive SheIby
before or after your affair?
- Oh, my God.
Dad, expIain.
- You were about three years oId
when we were reIocated to London
for my job,
and I was working overtime.
It was hardIy a recipe
for a happy marriage,
so we decided to separate--
- Which for your father
meant doing it
with the first woman
he couId find--
a minor detaiI he waited
25 years to teII me.
- Okay, I hear you.
I understand.
You feeI betrayed,
and I'm not minimizing
what happened 25 years ago,
but is it reaIIy worth
throwing away
a Iong and happy marriage?
- What makes you think
that I've been happy?
- WeII, of course we're happy.
- WeII, of course you're happy.
I've spent the best part
of my Iife
catering to your aduIterous ass.
Now it's my turn.
I want to feeI sexy.
I want to--
I want to have adventures.
- Okay.
Okay, Betty.
We're making some progress.
I want you both
to cIose your eyes,
take a deep breath,
and Iet's try and reconnect
with some of those feeIings
you had
when you first decided
to get married.
- Ava, this BerkeIey buIIshit
isn't gonna work on me.
- Mom!
- Look, I'm sorry, darIing,
but I'm not gonna take
maritaI advice
from my 28-year-oId
newIywed daughter.
- I'm a professionaI.
- And you're
a hopeIess romantic.
You've been watching
Gone With The Wind
every Thanksgiving
for the Iast 25 years.
- It's a very Iong weekend.
- And I wouId give it up, honey.
Rhett ButIer's
never gonna stick around.
- But they were
at cross-purposes.
- You know, the point is that
I am the voice of experience.
I have done 30 years
of hard marriage,
30 years of Iies
and deceit,
and in aII that time,
you've never once
put the toiIet roII
back on the dispenser.
- And after 30 years, you'd
think she'd give it up, huh?
- BradIey, you can have
that bathroom aII to yourseIf,
because I am moving in
with SheIby.
- Ava, you can't Iet Mom
move in with me.
- Okay, Mom, Iet's pause
and assess the situation.
We don't have to make
any permanent decisions today.
- Good-bye, BradIey.
Have a nice Iife.
- I refuse to Iive with Mom,
Ava.
- Okay, we have much bigger
probIems here, SheIby.
- Yeah, Iike a 30th anniversary
party for a divorced coupIe.

[door cIicks open]
- Hey, babe.
It's 6:00.
Time for our date.
I promise I'II hook up the dryer
this week, okay?
- I don't care.
- What's up?
- Today was probabIy
the worst day of my Iife,
and that's not an exaggeration.
- What happened?
- My dad had an affair.
- What?
- Before SheIby was born,
but my mom just found out,
and now she wants a divorce.
- That was 25 years ago.
- They were stiII married,
CharIie.
Oh...
They were so happy.
- So what are you gonna do?
- TechnicaIIy I'm not supposed
to treat them
because we're famiIy.
- So don't teII them
you're counseIing them.
Do it without them knowing.
- Yeah, I couId heIp them
surreptitiousIy.
- Where you going?
- To see my mom.
- Now?
What about our 6:00 date?
- The first 24 hours
of a separation
are criticaI, CharIie.
[door cIicks shut]
[touch-tones beeping]
[Iine rings]
- Hello?
- Hey, SheI. It's me.
- Oh, my God.
You got to get up here.
She's driving me crazy.
[door buzzes]
WeIcome to heII.
- Ava, shouIdn't you be home
basking in your
newIy wedded bIiss?
- Mom, are you sure moving out
is the best soIution?
- WeII, I certainIy can't Iive
in the same house
as my ex-husband.
SheIby, we need to move
the couch to the window.
- Uh, I Iike it where it is.
- No, you don't.
- You can't possibIy be
considering getting a divorce
after aII these years.
- This is between me
and your father.
- LittIe heIp, pIease!
- Okay, I compIeteIy encourage
your personaI deveIopment, Mom,
but you can take time to work on
yourseIf and stiII be married.
- WeII, it hasn't worked for me
so far.
Maybe it's time
I made myseIf happy.
- Are you reaIIy upset
about an oId affair,
or are you just using that
as an excuse to Ieave?
- Ava, be my daughter,
not my therapist.
- I'm just trying
to understand the situation.
- It's compIicated.
Why don't you ask your father
these questions?
- I'm going to,
but I reaIIy think you and Dad
wouId benefit from going to see
a counseIor,
and I can recommend
someone great.
- I'm not reaIIy sure
I beIieve in therapy.
- Excuse me?
- Oh, not you, honey.
I thought your therapy today
was wonderfuI.
- Therapy can be reaIIy heIpfuI.
I stiII go see my therapist
once a month for maintenance.
- [sighs]
WeII, I'II go.
If it'II make you happy.
- I thought it was time
to make yourseIf happy.
- I'm afraid that's aII the time
we have for today.
It's reaIIy important for me
to get to know more
about both of you,
so I'm gonna need you
to fiII out
these premaritaI
compatibiIity tests.
- Tests?
- More Iike questionnaires.
Don't worry. There are no
right or wrong answers.
Just be honest.
- Do we answer them
individuaIIy?
- Yes, and then I'II compare
your answers
to see how compatibIe you are.
So, Amy, you can stay in here,
and, John, why don't you
foIIow me out to reception?
- Okay.
See you.
- Thank you.
- InfideIity is one way
to discover if you stiII
reaIIy Iove your spouse.
Yeah.
You're weIcome.
- PIease teII me that was not
a prospective cIient.
- No.
They changed their mind.
And what the heII
is an angry pirate, anyway?
- SheIby.
- Back off.
- Give me my patient foIders.
Give me--
- [Iaughing]
- I'm aII right.
- Uh--
- They're confidentiaI.
- Party pooper.
- I am Iocking
the fiIing cabinet.
Have you taIked to Dad?
I've been trying him
aII afternoon.
I can't get ahoId of him.
- You think he cashed in
his chips?
- Where do you come up
with this stuff?
- I was an unwanted chiId, okay?
I have issues.
And besides,
his wife of 30 years
just Ieft him.
- I'm gonna run by the house
and check on him.
WiII you coIIect their tests
when they're done?
- Sure.
I'II meet you there.
Wait.
Ava.
Mom and Dad, they're gonna
work it out, right?
- Of course.
It's onIy naturaI for marriages
to go through ups and downs.
- Okay, I just--I can't imagine
them not together.
- Don't worry.
Once they get into therapy,
they'II faII in Iove
aII over again.
Trust me.

You know,

- Ugh.
WouId you knock it off?
You've never been
this Jewish before.
- I've aIways been Jewish.
- You've never been reIigious.
You were aIways the first dad

- WeII, I wanted to be
a perfect father to you girIs.
I stiII do.
You don't reaIIy need me

You got CharIie.
And being Jewish is the onIy
thing that feeIs famiIiar.
- Sometimes change
can be positive.
You and Mom couId use this time
to improve your reIationship.
- I just want things
the way they were.
- I think you're using
your spirituaIity
to avoid deaIing
with the fact that Mom Ieft.
- Are you anaIyzing me, Ava?
- No, no.
I'm just suggesting
maybe you do something
to make Mom want to come back.
- WeII, I'm her husband.
This is her home.
That shouId be enough.
- I want a pony!
- What?
- WeII, if you're not gonna act
your age, neither am I.
- GIad to know you're aIive.
- Hi, SheI.
- Who was the hottie?
- Nobody.
- Just the IocaI
deIi deIivery guy.
Oh, maybe Dad
couId hook you up.
- Ooh, I couId go for some
of those matzo baIIs.
- SheIby.
- Touchy.
What's with aII the candIes?
- Dad's being Jewish.
- So this is what it's Iike
to be Jewish.
- Mom agreed to go see
a marriage counseIor.
- She did?
- I couId set you up
with a fantastic therapist.
- You think that wouId heIp?

Ah!
Oh, my gosh.

- You move fast.
- WeII, I had to.
Her visa's up in a week.
If I'd Iet her go back

I might never have seen

- There's no iron curtain

She's stiII working

I went to a bar,

- Vodka?
- Vodka.
In CharIie's honor.
- My honor?
- For a faIIen comrade.
- But you don't even
drink vodka.
- I know.
That's the most amazing part.
It was handed to me

It was fate.

WeIcome to our country.

They're gonna be

counseIor wouId I be

Besides, my horoscope today

whatever I set my mind to.
- Here it is.

Hi, Ava.

I've heard great things

Sort of a rituaI.
So start out by taking
short, quick breaths
through the nose,
Iike this.
[snorting]
[aII snorting]
Now I want you to shake out
your body, Iike this.
Then hop up and down Iike this.
This is wonderfuI
for igniting your chakra energy.
Hop, hop, hop.

ignite your sphincter.
- [snorting]
- Shake out.
Shake out.
- Who's that?
- Adrianna.
I swear, if Gerber's not here
in the next five minutes,
we're ordering without him.
What's that?
- It's a PoIish phrase book.
I though it might heIp us get
to know Kasha a IittIe better.
- Yeah?
What's PoIish for ''green card''?
- Don't be so cynicaI.
They're in Iove.
- They don't even speak
the same Ianguage.
- Did you know there are
five Iove Ianguages?
Not aII of them are verbaI.
- SeriousIy?
You're the one saying
that marriage takes work,
commitment...
- But the faIIing-in-Iove stage
is the best part.
- Wow.
I guess the honeymoon is over.
- Baby, I faII in Iove with you
aII over again every day.
- Hi.
Sorry we're Iate.
- Okay.

Ha-ha!
WonderfuI, you two.

- I feeI humiIiated.
- Yeah, me too.
Oh, you might want to rethink
that whoIe hopping rituaI.
- I meant by your affair.
And now you won't even
teII the girIs about Ian.
I feeI Iike the Iast 25 years
of our marriage
was nothing but a sham,
buiIt on secrets and deception.
- She's got you there, BradIey.
- Excuse me?
- You had the affair.
She posted the first points.
What's your comeback?
- Are you keeping score?
- It heIps me figure out
who's to bIame.
- Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
That is a perfectIy cooked
steak.
How's your dinner, babe?
- It's cost my arms and Iegs.
[Iaughter]
- Um, it's arm and Ieg.
[smooching]
It's an arm and Ieg.
- An arm?
- An arm and Ieg.
- And Ieg.
- It costs an arm and Ieg.
- It costs an arm and Ieg.
- How cute is that?
That is cute.
Oh, as I keep expIaining
to these officiaIs,
that we had to get married
in a hurry
because her visa's running out.
- You didn't actuaIIy say that.
- You toId me to be honest.
- Yeah, but I meant teII them
that you're so in Iove,
you couIdn't wait
to get married,
not, ''Let's do it
before she gets deported.''
- WeII, I can't think
of a better reason
to get married on the fIy.
Not Iike ''I'm drunk
and in Vegas''
type deaI, right, buddy?
[soft thud]
Ow!
That was one
of your dumber ideas.
- What was a dumb idea?
- Oh!
CharIie!
[mumbIes indistinctIy]
- I'm so sorry, buddy.
- Okay, now a IittIe
to the right.
There you go.
Ooh, buII's-eye.
Whoop.
No Iookee.
- Maybe you shouId go home
and change.
- CharIie, what's with you?
- He's Iike Edward Scissorhands.
¶ CIumsy ¶
You got to Iive with that.
Now I know
why your first wife Ieft you.
Oh!
- [speaking PoIish]
- Okay.
I'm okay.
I'm okay.
You're okay?
[speaking PoIish]
- First wife?
What--what's he taIking about?
- You never toId her?
- When do you intend
to teII our daughters?
- I don't.
- TeII them what, BradIey?
- Nothing.
- Oh, for God's sakes.
You're not even gonna teII
our therapist about Ian?
- This is a private matter,
Betty.
He's a stranger.
- This is exactIy your probIem.
You're afraid of change.
You're afraid of anything new.
Do you know that he's eaten
the same breakfast
every morning
for the Iast 30 years?
OatmeaI,
without even any fruit on it,
the same bIand, boring thing.
- I'm a traditionaIist.
- WeII, I am sick of it.
And untiI you are wiIIing
to embrace
the new possibiIities
that Iife is offering you, I--
I can't be with you.
- I'm prescribing
a method of therapy
which I have found
extremeIy successfuI.
It's caIIed
''Brush with Death.''
It means time apart,
during which you don't
see each other
or taIk to each other.
And no phone caIIs.
- I'm in.
- I shouId have said something.
It was annuIIed, which is aImost
Iike it never happened.
I was drunk in Vegas.
I didn't even know the girI.
It doesn't count
as a reaI marriage.
- I can't beIieve you kept this
a secret from me.
- I didn't want
to disappoint you.
- How couId you do something
so stupid?
- I was 22.
- That's oId enough
to know better.
- TechnicaIIy that's onIy
2 times 1 1 .
- In what, guy years?
I don't--
I don't care what you did at 22.
I care that you Iied to me now.
- I didn't Iie to you.
- By omission.
It's the same thing.
How am I supposed to trust you?
- [sighs]
- A brush with what?
- Death.
A Brush with Death.
It's ridicuIous.
Is that a way
to save a marriage?
- His methods
are a IittIe unorthodox,
but he usuaIIy gets
great resuIts.
- Excuse me.
I'm gonna go have
a brush with death.
- You have to heIp me
with this.
- What can I do?
- I just figured,
with your prior experience,
you wouId know
aII about marriage.
- Jesus, Ava.
You can't punish me
for something I did
years before we even met.
- It hurts knowing
I'm not the onIy girI
you ever wanted to marry.
It spoiIs the fairy taIe.
- If it makes you feeI
any better,
you're the onIy one
I married sober.
I'm sorry.
You're the one, Ava.
I Iove you.
What can I do
to make you feeI better?
- HeIp me with my parents.
- Divorce is difficuIt, Ava,
but my parents are happier
now that they're not together.
- Do you think if my parents
get divorced,
my Dad's gonna want to go home
to an empty house?
- You're just pIaying dirty now.
- I just need you on my team.
- Okay.
I'm in.
- Ugh.
WorthIess trash.
- What did it say?
- ''Avoid aII team sports.''
- Dr. George was quite specific
when he said ''Brush with Death.''
It meant no contact.
- Yeah, but I figured
you and Dad
wouId probabIy respond better
to a more traditionaI method.
- BradIey.
You want to squeeze in a workout
after this?
- Oh, I aIready got my
squat thrusts in this morning.
- PIease, you haven't
thrust anything in years.
- WeIcome, everybody,
to MiracuIous Marriages.
Freak out the fear!
Now, if I couId get everybody
to gather round.
Gather round.
Get over here!
Okay, peopIe, eyes here.
First, Iet's start
with our affirmation of the day.
Marriage to the max.
Marriage the max.
[together]
Marriage to the max.
Marriage to the max.
Marriage to the max.
- Everybody.
Marriage to the max.
[together]
Marriage to the max.
Marriage to the max.
- WonderfuI.
Now for our first exercise,
we're going to start
a word association game.
I'm going to say a word,
and everybody is going to say
the first word
that pops
into their IittIe head.
Now, remember,
say everything you feeI.
There is no judgment here.
Let's start with you!
NewIywed!
- Commitment.
- Love.
- Wedding!
- Expensive.
- Cheap.
- Love!
- Cooking.
- GratefuI.
- Oh, baby.
- Home!
- Sharing.
- Ooh, cIothes.
- Husband!
- Hurt.
- Happy.
- Marriage!
- Can I just say
I Iove this exercise?
I actuaIIy use it
in my own practice.
- Stop right there!
One word.
- DisiIIusionment.
- DisiIIusionment?
AIready?
- Not us.
Them.
- This exercise is about us,
what marriage means to you.
- Enough!
One word.
- BIiss.
''BIiss'' is my word.
- Imperfections.
- Imperfections?
Are you taIking
about your first wife or me?
- I was taIking about me.
- Whatever.
Your word bIows.
- This a no-judgment circIe,
Ava.
- Next!
[whistIe bIowing]
- Oh!
Thanks for catching me.
- I shouId have Iet you faII.
- I guess I wouId have
deserved that, huh?
- OId habits die hard,
I suppose.
- This is aII about buiIding
trust with your partner.
- Oh!
Ava.
- Move faster, sir.
GirI in the green sweater,
pIease don't hoId
your wife's hand.
- Go, team us!
Go, team us!
AII right, baby.
- Love you.
- I Iove you.
- Maybe I shouId go first.
- WouId you give me some more
rope, you cheap bastard?
It's not even
your damn rope anyway.
- We have to use the Iine
sparingIy.
I'm not sure how much is Ieft.
- Trust your partner.
Embrace the mountain.
- Good job, babe.
- Work together as a team.
Come on, Betty!
Freak out the fear.
Freak out the fear!
- Fear is freaking me out.
- Mom, come on.
You can do it.
- Come on, Betty.
- BradIey, this is too high.
I can't go any further.
- Come on, Betty.
Don't be such a baby.
- Fine.
That's reaI supportive.
- Betty, your ass
is on my shouIder.
How much more supportive
do you want me to be?
- Then move.
I don't need you.
- Fine!
- [screaming]
- Mom, I'm coming!
- Ah!
- [gasps]
- [grunts]
[whistIe bIows]
- Oops.
WeII, the good news is,
you onIy have to wear the brace
overnight.
- Yeah, and the bad news is,
my wife tried to kiII me.
- CharIie, come on.
It was an accident.
I got distracted.
- By your parents.
- What am I supposed to do,
just stand back and Iet them
throw their marriage away?
- They're the ones
getting divorced.
Why are we the ones
suffering for it?
[cheerfuI ukuIeIe music]
- Oh, Moses,
another one of Mom's
indecipherabIe texts.
- Don't teII her we're going
to the fIorist, pIease.
- ''Getting coffee
on Magazine Street.''
So since Dad
is staying with you,
Shabbat at your pIace?
- What?
- Shabbat dinner.
It's Iike Thanksgiving
for Jews.
The whoIe famiIy gets together
to eat and argue,
but they do it every week.
So is it at your house?
- No, it's not at our house.
- You're a bad Jew.
- SheIby, I'm not Jewish,
and neither are you.
- You better hope God
didn't hear you say that.
- Crap.
Mom found us.
- Hi, babies!
I have exciting news.
- You and Dad
are back together?
- No,
I'm going to ThaiIand...
and India, China, Japan,
maybe even Tahiti.
- Oh, Iet's grab this tabIe.
- But Dad hates to fIy.
- Oh, I'm not going
with your father.
- And how Iong wiII you be gone?
- About six months.
- So I'II have the apartment
aII to myseIf again?
- How couId you do this
to Dad?
- It's aIways been my dream
to traveI.
WeII, you got to go to France
your junior year of coIIege,
and SheIby had those two months
when she went missing in Mexico.
- Ay de mi.
Tiempos mas buenos.
- Your father's been afraid
to traveI,
and this is my chance
to see the worId.
- This isn't Iike you, Mom.
- No?
No, it's not Iike me at aII.
I aIways do
what everybody eIse wants.
One day, you'II understand.
- No, I won't, because I wouId
never give up on my marriage.
- Like Miss Perfect wouId ever
have maritaI probIems.
- ActuaIIy, I just found out
that Mr. Perfect
has been keeping a big secret
from me.
- Is he cheating on you
with his hot assistant?
- SheIby.
- CharIie's not cheating on me.
- How do you know?
Do you monitor his caIIs,
check his texts?
- No, 'cause I'm not
a psycho.
- Such an amateur.
- CharIie wouId never cheat.
- That's what I thought
about Dad.
- Men aren't perfect, honey.
They're just men.
- AII of them?
- Yes, dear,
aII of them.
- Damn.
- Mwah.
Mwah.
Bye, babies.
- Roses or orchids
for the centerpieces?
What do you think?
- I think we shouId
sincereIy contempIate
changing the theme
of this party, Ava.
- SheIby, come on.
I need heIp.
- Yeah, you do.
Mom's Ieaving in ten days,
and the party's in two weeks.
What are you gonna teII
peopIe to say?
''Surprise, BradIey.
''We know
you're getting divorced,
''but we wanted to ceIebrate
the miIestone
that you didn't reach anyway''?
- They'II work it out!
- You shouId seriousIy
consider therapy.
- I've tried group therapy.
I've even tried that whack job
of a therapist
who toId them
not to communicate.
- The Brush with Death.
l heard it's very successful
in the long run.
- But I don't have the Iong run.
I've got about a week
to fix this.
- You have to fix it, Ava?
- Who eIse?
- How about your parents?
- WeII, they haven't exactIy
been very effective
Ieft to their own devices.
- And how has their separation
impacted your relationship
with Charlie?
- Who?
- Your husband.
- Oh, no.
CharIie.
He's fine.
He's great.
WeII, actuaIIy, I just found out
he deIiberateIy hid from me
the fact that he'd
been married before.
- So discovering
in quick succession
that both your father and your
husband were keeping secrets
doesn't have any great
significance for you?
- Okay.
I know where you're going
with this,
but can we just stick
to the issue at hand?
- Then your husband's previous
marriage is not an issue?
- Not presentIy.
No.
Can we get back to my parents?
- Did you consider
the possibility
that divorce could actually be
the best thing for your parents?
- [Iaughs]
SeriousIy, though,
what do I do?
- Let go.
Let them work it out
for themselves.
- [sighs]
By the way, do you Iock
your fiIing cabinets?
[rumbIing]
You hooked up the dryer.
- BradIey did it.
- Oh.
- Not that I don't appreciate
aII the heIp,
but sharing a house
with your dad
isn't exactIy how I envisioned
married Iife.
- This has been hard on me too,
CharIie.
- WeII, I miss my wife.
[rumbIing]
- Oh.
Hi.
This a bad time?
- Hi, Dad.
- BradIey.
- Thanks for hooking up
the dryer.
- Oh, it feeIs good to be handy,
you know.
I know Chuck's busy.
- I wouId have gotten to it
eventuaIIy.
- Yeah, right after you finish
putting up the sheIves
in our bedroom?
- [Iaughs]
- Excuse me.
I'm gonna take a shower.
- Did you taIk to your mom?
I mean, did you teII her
how sorry I am
about the ass thing?
- Um, I didn't get a chance,
actuaIIy.
She seems to have made
some traveI pIans.
- Yeah, but your mother
hates to traveI.
- ActuaIIy, it's aIways been
a dream of hers.
- She never mentioned anything.
- Did you ask?
Did you ever ask what she wanted
or if she was happy?
- She never compIained.
I just assumed
that everything was fine.
- I don't think this is just
about the affair, Dad.
Do you?
- So where's she going?
- ThaiIand.
- When?
- In ten days.
- Oh, no.
She's gonna miss
our anniversary.
How Iong is she going for?
- Um, she didn't say exactIy,
but she pIans on making
a coupIe of other stops
aIong the way.
- How Iong, Ava?
- Six months.
- Six months.
It's over.
She's reaIIy Ieft me
for good.
- Dad, you'II get her back.
You just have to show her
how much you Iove her
and remind her
how speciaI she is to you.
Can you pIease try
and cheer my dad up?
Maybe take him out
for a drink or something?
I need to stop my mom
from Ieaving.
We'II get the two of them
together.
We can taIk it through.
- That's a bad idea.
Group therapy sure didn't work.
- [groans]
I'm running out of options,
CharIie.
PIease heIp me.
You owe me for making me
wife number two.
- Fine.
I'II heIp you out one Iast time,
but you got to agree
to never mention that stupid
Vegas wedding again.
- DeaI.
[IiveIy mandoIin music]
¶ ¶
- Here we go, gentIemen.
- Hey.
Oh, I can't drink this.
- Oh, yeah, you can.
I know the owner.
He's a big-time Jew.
OnIy serves kosher.
- Oh, thanks, Gerber.
I didn't know
there were Irish Jews.
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?
- So this is great.
A night out with the boys.
- Yeah.
I got to teII you,
you got to Ieave the oId baII
and chain at home sometimes.
AIthough I can't compIain.
I Iove being married.
I have never had this much sex
in my Iife.
No, forget troIIing bars
to get Iaid.
Get married.
HeIIo.
- You don't have sex
aII the time.
- Oh, yeah.
Whenever I want.
Every which way.
- I miss my wife.
- Aw.
- Look, BradIey, I'm sure
you guys wiII work it out,
and if you don't--
- Yeah, be a man.
BradIey, there are pIenty
of other chicks in the sea.
Eastern Europe is teeming
with beautifuI young women
just dying to marry
a rich American.
- Let's not get ahead
of ourseIves here, Gerber.
- 60 is the new 30.
I saw you over
at the karaoke machine,
ripping it up,
going to work.
[Tarzan yeII]
Dude, SIavic hotties wiII be
aII over your Johnson.
Yeah, they wiII be Iining up
for a man with your experience.
- You think?
- AbsoIuteIy.
- Bet you find
a nice Jewish girI.
Uh-oh.
- WouIdn't Betty just Iove that?
- Oh, I know the perfect pIace
to ceIebrate your
newIy anointed singIe status.
- Where?
- Got any doIIar biIIs on you?
- Ah!
Let's have shots for everybody.
- We are gonna put
some boobs on your face.
Okay?
- Okay, just this one time.
Yes.
- Booby in your eye.
- I know the separation's
hard on you, Ava,
so I reaIIy appreciate
your show of support.
I shouId be netting the web
in no time at aII.
- I just figured if you're gonna
be gone for six months,
you need to be
internet and emaiI savvy.
Now we can keep in touch.
- WeII, I must admit,
I am a IittIe nervous.
- You are?
- WeII, it's been a Iong time
since I did anything
this exciting or brave.
I can't remember
the Iast time I did anything
without your father.
- Or you couId do this with him.
- Dad traveI?
He has a hard time
going to the maiIbox.
- [Iaughs]
I just know he's devastated
without you.
[bIuesy rock music pIaying]
- [sIurping]
- Chase it!
- Yeah!
- Oh!
Who's next?
- Oh, my God!
- Here's BradIey!
- Aren't you just a IittIe sad
that your marriage is over?
- WeII, of course I am, Ava,
but your father's incapabIe
of change or even compromise.
And I refuse to be unfuIfiIIed
any Ionger.
- Why didn't you say anything
before?
- I suppose I was
too busy worrying
about everyone eIse's needs
to think about my own.
[indistinct chatter]
Doesn't that sound Iike--
[Ioud thud]
What?
- I'm aII right.
I'm okay.
No probIem.
Oh, you know, CharIie,
you're my bestest,
favoritest son-in-Iaw ever.
- ReaIIy?
'Cause you're, Iike,
my very favorite
most father-in-Iaw ever.
- Oh, come on,
give me a hug.
- BradIey GoId.
- Did you hear that?
That sounded Iike my wife,
except I don't have one anymore.
[Iaughter]
- ExactIy what did you have
to drink tonight?
- I don't know, but I'm sure
wasn't Manischewitz.
[Iaughter]
- You shouId be ashamed
of yourseIf.
- What?
- What the heII
is wrong with you?
- How was I supposed to know
your mom wouId be here?
- I toId you I was gonna try
to get the two of them together.
This is your idea of heIping?
- You toId me to cheer him up.
Trust me,
tonight he was so happy.
- PIease teII me you did not
take my father Hot Chicks Live.
- We didn't go
to Hot Chicks Live.
Gerber's way too cheap
for Hot Chicks Live.
- Gerber was with you?
I hope you took a cab.
- I guess chauffer duties were
in their marriage arrangements,
'cause Gerber's wife
drove us home.
And she's great,
and they're having sex--
great PoIish sex,
whatever that means--
whenever he wants.
- Show up at your daughter's
house this time of night,
drunk as a skunk.
I mean, what do you have
to say for yourseIf?
- [burps]
- [snickers]
- Thank you, BradIey,
for vaIidating a very difficuIt
Iife-aItering decision
I've just made.
I now know
absoIuteIy for certain
that Ieaving you is the smartest
thing I've ever done.
- Mom, you don't mean that.
- Yeah.
- Do you know that I dis--
I discovered tonight
at this strip cIub?
- No, pIease enIighten me.
- I thought you said you didn't
take him to a strip cIub.
- No, I said I didn't take him
to Hot Chicks Live.
- I Iearned that there are women
in this worId who want me.
- Oh, they don't want you,
you idiot.
They want your doIIar biIIs.
- You know,
there's a nation in Europe
that has a Iot
of pretty Russian Jews
who want to have sex with me.
- And time for bed.
- Too bad that you don't have
the baIIs
to fIy out there and meet them.
- WeII, then I'II just have
to ship them in.
- [screams]
- MazeI tov.
- Oh!
I squished my fish.
Oh, no.
- Dude, did you say you were
gonna ship your baIIs?
- Poor MaIcoIm.
- This is what I'II be missing?
- Mom, pIease.
- Hey, BradIey, when I'm
cavorting naked on a Fiji beach
with my PoIynesian Adonis,
I shaII try to remember
to send you a postcard.
[door sIams]
- Oh...
I think that went weII.
- I...
- ''I'' what?
- I Iove you.
- Do you reaIize
that what you did tonight
brought my parents
cIoser than ever to divorce?
- What I did?
I was just trying
to cheer him up.
I was heIping you.
But if you hadn't tried
to interfere tonight,
none of this wouId have happened
in the first pIace.
- CharIie, my parents
are getting divorced.
I have reaI probIems.
- You know, maybe we shouId stop
focusing on your parents...
Nice sheIves.
And start focusing on us.
- Uh, what's that supposed
to mean?
- WeII, for one thing,
it's been a IittIe difficuIt
to have sex
with your dad staying here.
- Oh, I'm surprised you noticed.
You've been so busy
texting with Adrianna.
Work must be crazy.
- You're the one
who's too distracted
with everyone eIse's probIems
to even have sex
with your own husband.
- [sighs]
It's not been that Iong
since we've had sex,
and I've been busy.
- WeII, you're not
doing anything right now.
- Ugh, CharIie,
if you think I'm gonna
sIeep with you right now,
you're even more drunk
than I thought.
Oh!
Is it reaIIy too much to ask
to repIace
the toiIet paper roII?
Is it reaIIy that difficuIt?
What is it?
A genetic predisposition
to measure your shits
against the amount
of toiIet paper Ieft?
Oh!
And just so you know,
I did not faII in Iove with you
again today.
[tranquiI instrumentaI music]
¶ ¶
- Morning, beautifuI.
I made your favorite.
BIack coffee,
two sugars.
Wheat toast with mayo.
Truce?
- Truce.
I have to canceI
the surprise party.
- You can't save
every marriage, Ava.
- I feeI Iike such a faiIure.
- Promise me
you're done intervening.
- I have no other choice.
- Promise?
Meet me tonight for dinner?
- Mm-hmm.
I can teII that some
positive changes
have taken pIace
since our Iast session.
What's going on?
- When we Ieft here, I began
to make that Iist you suggested.
I dug reaIIy deep,
and I reaIized the main reason
I was attracted to Courtney
was because her famiIy was rich.
- Perhaps you were Iooking
to Courtney
to provide emotionaI security.
- WeII, mostIy I just Iiked
the fact she drove a Porsche.
- And I reaIized
what I Iiked about LIoyd
was that he wasn't rich.
I knew that if I married him,
it wouId reaIIy piss off
my father.
- Excuse me?
- Once we were finaIIy honest
with each other,
it was Iike this huge reIief.
So we've decided
to get a divorce.
- And we just wanted to come
here in person to thank you.
- To thank me for what?
- If it wasn't for you,
we couId be stuck
in a Iousy marriage for years
without knowing any better.
- PIease, don't mention it.
- Oh, I just got four winks

- I aIready got a date.
- I need the guest Iist
for the party.
I have to canceI it before
I meet CharIie for dinner.
- You've seen the Iight.
I am taking Mom speed dating
tonight,
show her what the singIe Iife
is reaIIy Iike.
- Genius.
- I have my moments.
- Hey.
- Hi, John.
- Do you guys
have an appointment?
- No, things didn't reaIIy
work out with Amy and me.
- Oh.
So you're here to taIk about it?
- No, actuaIIy,
I was wondering
if SheIby was avaiIabIe
for dinner this evening.
- Mm. No.
I saw your test scores.
- Cares more about your marriage
than you do.
That's why you got to talk
to your woman
and find out
what's the trouble.
- Amen, brother.
Amen.
[door cIicks open]
- Rough day?
- Rough week.
- Why'd you have an affair, Dad?
- You know,
that was a Iong time ago.
I never wouId have done it
if I thought your mother and I
were gonna be reconciIed.
But...
I'm miserabIe, Ava.
I can't sIeep.
I can't eat.
I just want her back.
- Don't worry, Dad.
We'II get her back.
You and me together,
we'II do whatever it takes.
Why don't you go
get an earIy night?
- I just haven't been abIe
to sIeep since she Ieft.
My mind keeps me awake,
keeps racing.
- CharIie has sIeeping piIIs.
- You think that's safe?
- Of course.
I'II go grab them.
- WeII, how many do I take?
- Two, and you'II sIeep
Iike a baby.
No!
I said two, Dad.
- From what I remember
about babies,
they wake up a Iot.
Good night, pumpkin.

- Oh, you'II Iove it.
You can squeeze in 50 bad dates

- Oh!
[Iaughs]
WeII, weIcome, aII.
Now, you'II have five minutes
to speak with your date.
When I hit that buzzer,
the man must move on
to the next woman.
Under 35s to my right.
Over 35s to my Ieft.
Ladies, pIease,

ls this an emergency?
- Hi, I think my dad
overdosed on sIeeping piIIs,
and I need an ambuIance
right away.
- A marriage is forever.
FideIity is essentiaI.
A shame my ex-wife
didn't agree.
Yeah, she Ieft me.
- Oh.
- At Ieast she thinks she did.
[Iaughing]
[buzzer buzzes]

Rawr!

Time to switch.
Get over here.

You like squirrels?

I hate these things.
- Hmm.
- Ava!
Ava!
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- BradIey.
What happened?
- How many sIeeping piIIs
did he take?
- Uh, I don't know,
but the bottIe was empty
when I found it.
- My bottIe of sIeeping piIIs?
That was practicaIIy fuII.
- One of you can ride with us.
- I'II foIIow in my car, okay?
- Okay.
[phone ringing]
- So do you want to go home
and sIit our wrists now
or get drunk first?
- Hi, Ava.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, we're coming.
We're coming.
- I never shouId have Ieft
my piIIs out.
I just didn't see this coming.
Did you?
- Me?
No.
- Where is he?
Where is he?
Is he aII right?
- It's okay.
Doctors are in with him
right now.
- It's aII my fauIt.
I'm a horribIe wife.
- I can't beIieve he actuaIIy
tried to kiII himseIf.
- SheIby.
Not now.
- He's recovering niceIy.
- Oh, thank God for that.
Can I see him?
- Of course. Go in.
Nurse, show her in, pIease.
I have to teII you, though,
we did find
some very smaII traces
of the drug in his system.
In my opinion, this was not
a suicide attempt.
- Oh, that's a huge reIief,
Doctor.
Thank you so much for your heIp.
Thank you.
- You're weIcome.
We'II keep him here overnight
just to make sure,
but he shouId be fine to Ieave
in the morning.
- Okay.
- AII right.
- It's just so strange.
You said the bottIe
was empty, right?
- Yeah, I think.
- Either it was empty
or not.
- Mm.
It's not that simpIe.
- What's not that simpIe?
It was empty, or why eIse
wouId you caII 91 1 ?
- As a precaution.
- Ava, what are you
taIking about?
- I've aIways wanted to try
the food here.
I hear their JeII-O
is fabuIous.
- I may have
sIightIy exaggerated
the number of piIIs
that he took.
- Exaggerated?
- I'm gonna go find
the cafeteria
and that hot doctor.
- Oh, you're not
gonna Iike this.
Um...
I knew my dad didn't take
the whoIe bottIe,
but he was having
a Iot of troubIe sIeeping,
so he took three
to heIp him faII asIeep.
- And the rest of them?
- I fIushed them
down the toiIet.
- You did what?
- I know.
I'm not proud.
- Jesus, Ava.
What the heII is wrong with you?
- I was desperate, okay?
My dad has been just devastated
since the separation,
and I needed to do something
to bring them together.
- You promised me
you were done interfering.
What you did was iIIegaI.
If anyone found out,
you couId Iose your Iicense.
You couId even go to prison.
- CharIie, you're making it
sound way worse than it is.
- No, Ava,
I'm teIIing you how it is.
- Their 30th anniversary
is coming up--
- I can't beIieve this.
- Why are you waIking away
from me?
- How dare you think you can
just manipuIate peopIe
to get your way?
- I'm sorry, but I did it
for my parents.
- No, you didn't do it
for them.
You did it for yourseIf.
- I was onIy trying
to heIp.
CharIie, where are you going?
- I can't beIieve
this is who you are!

- I'm dead, aren't I?
- No.
Very much aIive.
- Are you sure?
Because for me,
heaven is where you are, Betty.
I Iove you so much.
And I'II do
whatever you want me to do.
I'II get on a pIane
to ThaiIand.
I'II pick up a tapeworm
in India.
I'II even come cIean
with the girIs about Ian.
But I want you to be happy,
Betty,
and I want to be part
of that happiness.
- When I got that phone caII
tonight,
I reaIized that you're not
a part of that happiness.
- Oh.
- You are
that happiness to me.
Mm.
- Mm.
- [Iaughs]
- [snorts]
[Iaughter]
- Mom's gonna spend
the night.
You need a ride?
If it's any consoIation,
I thought it was
an inspired idea.
- Thanks.
I'II remember that when I get
the divorce papers.
- No, I'm serious.
That took major baIIs.
I have a newfound respect
for you.
- Somehow that makes me
feeI worse.
- Excuse me.
What room is BradIey GoId in?
- Just a second.
- Isn't that
the deIi deIivery guy?
- Yeah, his wife, Betty,
caIIed me.
I'm his son.
- It's room 41 2.

Thank you.

When's your birthday?

- Busy month.
- Is there a JuIy?
- How Iong have you known?
- Ian came to me
right after your wedding.
- How come you didn't
say anything before?
- Oh, I was shocked.
- In our dad's defense,
he didn't know about me.
My mom kept his identity secret.
I mean, I onIy found out,
weII, after she died
a few months ago.
- That sucks.
- Yeah, yeah,
it reaIIy does.
- Sorry.
So when were you pIanning
on teIIing us?
- He was working up to it.
- I reaIize that I have
some apoIogizing to do,
and, Ian, I know that I
missed out on, weII, everything.
But I'd Iike to make it up
to you if you'd Iet me.
- And aII this time,
I thought I was an onIy chiId.
- You might stiII wish you were.

Remember me?
- I'm not sure who you are.
- [sighs]
I know you're angry,
but you didn't teII me about
your whoIe Vegas wedding,
and I stiII forgave you.
So maybe this is my
totaI screw-up moment
you just have to forgive me for.
You pIanning on coming home
anytime soon?
- I can't answer that
right now.
- You can't just ignore
our marriage, CharIie.
- The way you have?
- I'm a therapist.
HeIping peopIe is what I do.
But this was personaI.
My parents were separating.
- Yeah.
- [sighs]
The anniversary party's on
for tomorrow afternoon.
WiII you be my date?
- I'm not reaIIy in the mood
to ceIebrate.
- Is there something eIse
going on?
I mean, you and Adrianna
seem awfuIIy cIose.
- If that's the person
who you think you married,
then what are you
even doing here?
- Aren't we worth fighting for?
- What are you fighting for?
Your marriage or me?
- It's the same thing.
- No.
No, it's not.
You want a husband so when your
patients ask if you're married,
you can teII them yes.
And that way, it'II vaIidate
aII the advice you give them.
I feeI Iike the worst thing
we did to our reIationship
was get married.
- Sorry to interrupt you guys.
CharIie,
it's your conference caII
to discuss the new chardonnay.
They're on Iine two.
- Thanks.
I have to get this.

- Got any tequiIa over there?
- What, you want a shot?
- Just hand me the whoIe bottIe.
- You know why I think CharIie
gave you the wine
for a wedding gift?
- Is this reaIIy reIevant, Dad?
- CouId be.
He toId me once that
when the grapes are growing,
the winemakers
purposeIy stress them out
by depriving them of water
and giving them
an overabundance of sunshine.
Now, this weeds out
the weak ones,
and onIy the strongest
and best survive,
and those are the grapes
that make the finest wine.
Now, the greatest Iove
survives the harshest
of conditions.
And surviving that turmoiI
is what makes a marriage strong.
- Thanks, Dad.
But I stiII want the tequiIa.
- [Iaughs]
- Dude, better get dressed.
Come on.
Don't want to be Iate
and ruin the surprise.
- I'm not going.
[door cIicks shut]
- [speaking PoIish]
- [speaking PoIish]
I Ieft the toiIet seat up.
It's a work in progress.
- TeII me about it.
- You know, buddy,
you're aIways weIcome here,
but how Iong
are you pIanning to stay?
It's just Kasha's parents
are coming to visit
and her two brothers
and three cousins.
- Are you aII right
with that?
- AbsoIuteIy.
When you get married, you don't
set Iimits on what Iove means.
Okay, but that shit is weird,
dude, with the bread
and the mayo.
I bet you're the onIy person
on Earth
that eats toast that way.
- Dad, are you sure
you can drink that?
I don't think it's kosher.
- WeII, I'm taking
a more reIaxed approach
to things these days.
Besides,
we're ceIebrating.
Your mother and I just booked
a trip to ThaiIand.
- Wow.
- Exotic trips,
exotic cuisine--
how wiII you survive?
[cork pops]
- Tums.
- Ian's gonna housesit
for us.
- What?
How come he gets to?
- Because he's oIder,
sweetheart.
- By a month.
- SibIing rivaIry.
Started aIready.
- Don't worry about it, SheI.
I'II invite you
to aII the wiId parties.
And you won't even
be responsibIe for the cIeanup.
- Brother, where have you been
aII my Iife?
Come with me.
I'II show you where Dad
hides the good booze.
- Is CharIie meeting us
at the winery?
- It was nice of him to
invite us to the wine tasting.
- It's not you guys
he's upset with.
- WeII, best get going.
- Betty.
- Yes?
Oh, thank you, darIing.
I'm just gonna run upstairs
and update my Facebook status.
- I hate to see you go,
but I Iove to watch you Ieave.

- BradIey, did you take
your antacid?

- You know how white wine
affects your stomach.
You won't be abIe to sIeep.
- With any Iuck...
[together]
Surprise!
[Iaughter]
- Are you two
responsibIe for this?
- You two shouId be grounded
for Iying to us.
- Are we reaIIy grounded?
- She's not my mom.
- WeII, I don't beIieve it.
- WeII, I just want to thank
you aII for being here today.
30 years is no mean feat,
and I'd be Iying to you
if I toId you that we hadn't had
a few bumps aIong the road.
- Or mountains.
- But I just want to teII you
how Iucky I feeI
to have this woman
by my side
and how I Iove her even more
for sticking with me
during those trying times
when even I might have Ieft me.
So I just want
to propose a toast
to the Iove of my Iife,
to Betty.
- Betty.
- Betty.

CharIie running Iate?
- I don't think
he's gonna make it.
- WiII you two?
- I don't know.
I don't know what happened.
- Yeah, I mean,
you ignored him
by prioritizing your parents,
sex-starved him,
and then you went
psycho criminaI on his ass.
I can see
where it gets confusing.
- [sighs]
I did try apoIogizing.
- Trying to get him to come
to your parents'
anniversary party
so you don't Iose face
in front of the famiIy
is a Iot Iike apoIogizing.
- When did you get so smart?
- Is Ava DaIton admitting
that she doesn't know
everything?
- Yes, yes.
Okay, I admit it.
I'm not perfect,
and I don't know everything.
- WeII, I've known that
for about 25 years.
I think there might be
someone eIse
you need to mention it to.
- Oh, say good night
to Mom and Dad for me.
- I shouId open
my own practice.
- There you are, darIing.
I've been Iooking for you.
This is Jeremiah,
Rabbi Stevens' son.
And this is my daughter SheIby.
- Hi, Jeremiah,
Rabbi Stevens' son.
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
- I think you may find you have
quite a few things in common.
- So you're Jewish.
Wait a minute.
My dad toId me about you.
Aren't you
the wandering degenerate?
- And aren't you
the sponging sister?
- It's ''sIutty sponging sister,''
if you don't mind.
- No, actuaIIy,
I don't mind at aII.
- [Iaughing]
[spirited piano music]
¶ ¶
- I'm so sorry, CharIie.
- Before you start apoIogizing,
I have some things to say.
Okay?
About eight weeks ago,
you promised to Iove me
in sickness, in heaIth,
and aII that other stuff.
Remember?
WeII, I have some amendments
to those vows.
Do you promise to faII in Iove
with me every day,
even when we fight?
- Yes.
- WiII you swear
to have sex with me
at Ieast twice a week,
sometimes twice a day
when the mood strikes?
- Oh, yes.
- And finaIIy,
do you accept the fact
that I'II probabIy never, ever
in the next 50 years
remember to put a new
toiIet roII on the dispenser?
- [Iaughing]
I do.
- Let's go back.
Let's show these peopIe
that we know how to make
a marriage work.
- No.
- No?
- A marriage isn't officiaI
untiI it's been consummated.
- I knew there was a reason
why I married you.
