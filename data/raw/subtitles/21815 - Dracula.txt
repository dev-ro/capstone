"Adapted From the Novel
By Bram Stoker"
"Near Bistritz...
the road turns towards
the heart of the Carpathians...
one of the most barren and
least known places in Europe."
- Allow me.
- Thank you very much.
What was that, Sara?
"...one of the most barren and
least known places in Europe."
Keep reading.
"Crumbling castles are scattered
among the rugged summits.
They belong to a remote era..."
Coachman, you should go
a little slower!
No! No! We must get to the inn
before nightfall.
Why?
Today is Walpurgis Nacht,
the night of bad omen.
Nosferatu...
The dead come out
from their tombs...
and suck the blood
of the living.
Nonsense!
You would not laugh
if you lived here.
Tonight all doors
will be locked.
And we shall pray
to the Virgin.
How was the trip?
- Very good, thank you.
- Well, I am glad to hear it.
Lad, don't take my luggage down.
I must continue on
to the Borgo Pass.
I must warn you that today is
the day of St. Walpurga...
which is considered a bad omen
in this area.
And the coachman,
who is a good man...
wishes to know whether
you wouldn't mind...
continuing the journey
after sunrise.
I am very sorry,
but at midnight...
a carriage will be waiting
for me at the Borgo Pass.
- Whose carriage?
- Count Dracula's.
From Dracula's castle?
Right.
That is my destination.
Look, he wants to go tonight
to the Borgo Pass.
I beg you
to stay the night here.
But all of this
is mere superstition.
I mean, in a mountainous area
like this one...
I do not understand how...
Anyway, what I mean to say
is that I am not afraid.
I have already told him
that it is a business matter.
I must go there, really.
Wait.
Since you want to leave...
put this on. Put it on,
for your mother's sake.
It will protect you.
- Thanks.
- You are very welcome.
- Good night.
- Good night.
And I wish you
a good journey.
- Good night.
- Good night and good luck.
Giddap! Giddap!
Tell me...
do you really believe
there are vampires...
who come out of their tombs
and roam about looking for blood?
- I have seen the victims!
- Nonsense!
Come, Sara.
Count Dracula's carriage?
I am Dracula.
You have come
at the right time.
I have no idea what happened to
the coachman and to my luggage.
With all that, I thought
I came to the wrong place.
The walls of my castle
are cracked.
The shadows are many.
But come in.
Make yourself at home.
Listen to them.
They are the children
of the night.
What beautiful music
they make!
The eternal fight
for survival.
Every living creature needs
blood to keep on living.
The spider weaves the web
to catch the unwary fly.
The blood is the life,
Mr. Renfield.
I think you will find this part
of the castle more attractive.
I certainly do.
I thought
you might be hungry.
You are very kind,
Count Dracula.
- Sit down.
- Thanks.
I trust that nobody knows
about this visit.
Absolutely nobody,
as you recommended.
I assume you have burnt
all our correspondence.
I have followed
all your instructions to the letter.
Excellent, Mr. Renfield.
Excellent.
It was nothing.
Just a scratch.
Won't you have some?
I never drink... wine.
And now,
if you are all right...
I would like to talk
about the lease of Carfax Abbey.
But all the documents
are in my briefcase.
I took the liberty
of sending for your luggage.
Everything is in order.
You just need to sign it.
I hope there are enough tags
for all your bags.
I am only taking
three boxes.
We shall leave
tomorrow night.
Everything will be ready.
I hope
you find it comfortable.
Thanks.
It looks appealing.
Now I shall leave you alone.
I may be occupied tomorrow
during the day.
In that case,
we shall meet here at dusk.
Good night, Mr. Renfield.
Look!
Fingers stiffened on the wheel
as if they were frozen.
He must have died of fright.
What a terrible tragedy!
Not even a shred of the sails
is left.
It must have been
a terrible storm.
What about the sailors?
What became of them?
Master! Master!
We have arrived!
Can't you hear me, Master?
Master!
- What is that?
- It's coming from that hatchway.
"Crew Of Corpses
On Abandoned Ship"
"Ferocious storm
believed to be the cause"
"A madman is
the only survivor"
"Maritime authorities
will deliver...
"the shipment
to the consignees."
You will tell Dr. Seward,
who is sitting in the next box...
that there is a phone call
for him.
Once you have given him
this message...
you will not remember anything.
Dr. Seward,
there is a phone call for you.
Excuse me.
- Pardon me.
- Yes?
By chance,
I heard your name.
Are you the Dr. Seward
who has a sanitarium in Whitby?
That's right.
I am Count Dracula.
I have just rented
Carfax Abbey.
I understand it is next to
the gardens of your sanitarium.
Correct. It lies
next to my property.
It is a great pleasure
to meet you, Count.
Would you like to join us?
Count, allow me to introduce
to you my daughter Eva.
Miss Weston.
Mr. Harker.
Count Dracula has just rented
Carfax Abbey.
It will be a joy to see those
dark windows lit up again.
Count, I beg you to excuse me,
there is a phone call for me.
In the meantime,
please be seated.
My pleasure.
A pretty house could be built
out of those Carfax ruins.
Of course,
a lot of money is needed.
I shall barely touch them.
They remind me
of the crumbling walls...
of my own castle
in Transylvania.
What they remind me of
is that old toast:
"Lofty beams
upon deserted walls...
beat with the echo
of our laughter...
as if the dead
whispered through them."
How nice!
Wait, wait.
There is something
even nicer.
"For those who are already dead
let us empty our glasses...
"And let us cheer for the one
who must die first."
You can keep the rest to yourself,
Lucía.
To really die...
to be really dead...
must be sublime.
But, Count...
Something worse
than death...
lies in wait
for the living.
You can laugh
as much as you want.
I find him fascinating.
Lucía, the romantic girl.
That explains it.
That part about
the crumbling walls...
I still prefer someone
a little more normal.
- Like Juan?
- Yes, my dear friend, yes.
Like Juan.
Well, Countess,
I am very tired.
I leave you with your Count
and his crumbling abbey.
May you have
sweet dreams.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- The fog is getting thicker.
- It is.
Another death.
When was the last transfusion
performed on Miss Weston?
About four hours
before her death.
The same symptoms
in each one of the cases.
A baffling loss of blood...
that we have been unable
to prevent.
Give me the magnifying glass.
And these same two marks
were found...
on the neck of each
of the victims.
Gentlemen...
we are dealing
with vampires.
- With vampires?
- Vampires?
Nosferatu?
Yes, the vampire
of Transylvania.
That is right.
Nosferatu, the vampire.
The vampire attacks
his victim on the neck...
and leaves
two tiny white wounds...
with a red dot
in the center.
But, Professor Van Helsing,
that theory is implausible.
In these times, medical science
does not accept...
the existence
of such a creature.
That is just a myth.
A superstition.
Dr. Seward's patient,
Renfield...
whose blood
I have just analyzed...
is obsessed with the idea that
he must eat other living creatures...
in order to feed
his own life.
I am going to England with
Dr. Seward to study Renfield's case.
And perhaps
I will prove to you...
that the superstition
of times gone by...
may become a scientific truth
in our times.
Look.
"Seward Sanitarium"
No, don't take it away, Martín!
Don't take it away!
You are a good man. Don't!
Aren't you ashamed
of yourself?
Now, you are interested
in spiders. Spiders!
You're no longer content
with flies.
Flies?
Wretched flies.
Tiny flies.
Who can be content
with flies?
You!
A raving lunatic!
When beautiful and plump spiders
are not available...
maybe.
All right, do as you please.
But now, come with me.
The Professor wants to talk
to you again. Let's go!
It is a very strange case.
Nevertheless, the only thing
Renfield has craved so far...
are small bugs.
Not human beings.
That is what we think, Doctor.
But you say that he slips away
from his room.
That he's gone for hours.
Where does he go?
Come in!
Well, Mr. Renfield.
You look much better now
than when I arrived this morning.
Thanks, Professor.
I feel much better.
Martín.
I was told that you studied
at Oxford University.
That is right. I graduated
from the School of Law.
In 1927.
I was accepted by the bar
in 1928.
Afterwards...
Excuse me.
An inferior organism.
Unworthy of my attention.
What would you have done
with that fly...
had we not been here?
Eat it up.
Tell me, Mr. Renfield...
what makes you eat flies?
The wings of flies, sir...
represent the aerial power
of the psychic faculties.
There is more to this fellow
than meets the eye, Doctor.
I have never seen you
like this before, Eva.
What is wrong with you?
Are you worried about something?
Have I done something to hurt you?
You haven't done anything, Juan.
Don't worry.
But there is something wrong.
Tell me.
I don't know what it could be.
I have been feeling
frightened lately.
When the night
begins to fall...
I get this feeling...
that something
tightens around me.
Oh, Juan.
Do not touch me
with that disgusting device!
Come on, Renfield.
You must let me out of here.
Why is it so important to you?
Because I scream at night.
I might bother Miss Eva...
and even cause her
to have nightmares.
Nightmares?
Yes, Doctor.
Yes! Nightmares.
- It sounds like a wolf howling.
- Yes, it sure does.
But I hardly think there are wolves
so near London.
He thinks there are.
And I have heard
howling at night.
He says
that they talk to him.
And he screams back
at the top of his voice.
He is crazy.
I should have known.
You know very well
why the wolves talk.
Isn't that true,
Mr. Renfield?
And you also know
how to make them stop.
You know too much
to go on living!
We won't get another word
out of him for the time being.
You can take him away, Martín.
Get up, flycatcher.
I warn you again, Doctor.
If you do not let me go,
you will be responsible...
for whatever happens
to your daughter.
What is that herb
that made him so upset?
It's wolfbane.
The peasants in Central Europe
use it to drive vampires away.
And Renfield reacted
as soon as he smelled it.
Yes.
He must be closely watched
day and night.
Especially at night.
Yes.
You were saying
that you had gone to bed.
Yes. I was reading
and I fell asleep.
I began to dream.
A dog barked.
And it looked as if the whole room
filled up with mist.
It was so thick...
that I could hardly see
the light by my bedside.
It looked like a tiny spark
lost amidst the fog.
I saw two red eyes
staring at me...
and a livid, white face
through the fog.
He came closer and closer.
I could feel his breath
on my face.
And his lips... Ah!
Eva, it was just a dream.
The next morning...
I felt very weak, as if all the life
had been drained out of me.
When did you have that dream,
Miss Eva?
The night...
that Father left for Switzerland.
That is to say,
the night...
after Lucía was buried.
Let's see.
Think for a moment.
Do you remember anything...
that might have caused
that nightmare?
Nothing.
There is something
troubling Eva, Doctor.
Something she doesn't want
to tell us.
And the face that you saw
in your dream...
you say that it was
getting closer and closer?
That the lips touched you?
Where?
- Eva.
- No, Father. Please!
- What do you have on your neck?
- Please, Father.
How long have you had
those marks on your neck?
Marks?
Since the day
after that dream.
Count Dracula is here.
It is a pleasure
to see you again, Doctor.
I was sure
that you were back.
Miss Seward.
Excuse me, Count Dracula.
This is Professor Van Helsing.
Van Helsing, the distinguished
man of science...
whose fame is known even
in the mountains of Transylvania.
Doctor, I beg you
to excuse me...
but your daughter had better go
to her room immediately.
Aren't you feeling well?
I hope it is
nothing serious.
I had a terrible dream
a few nights ago...
and I have not been able
to get it out of my mind.
Perhaps you have taken
my stories too seriously?
Stories?
I made a humble effort
to entertain your fiancée...
by telling her
a few of the legends...
somewhat gloomy ones...
about my distant motherland.
Daughter, I am sure
Count Dracula will excuse you.
It is imperative
that you go to your room...
as Professor Van Helsing
has advised you to do.
But, Father, I tell you
I'm feeling fine now.
You had better do
as your father says.
Very well, then.
Good night,
my dear daughter.
I must go, Doctor.
Professor Van Helsing...
I hope I shall have the pleasure
of seeing you again.
Good night.
Good night, Juan.
Mr. Harker.
I shall come by later
to inquire how you're feeling.
Thanks.
- Good night, Miss Seward.
- Good night.
I am very sorry that
my visit was so... untimely.
- Not at all.
- On the contrary...
it may turn out to be
of great importance.
Moreover, before you leave,
you could be helpful to us.
It will be a pleasure
to do whatever I can.
Just a moment ago, I discovered
an amazing phenomenon.
Something so incredible
that I do not trust my own eyes...
and I want you
to help me prove it.
Look.
Dr. Seward,
please accept my apologies.
I couldn't help it.
Considering that
you have not yet lived...
even a single lifetime...
you are a wise man, Professor.
Did you see the expression
on his face?
He looked like
an enraged beast.
Dracula is our vampire.
Vampire?
For God's sake, Professor.
Vampires cast no reflection
in a mirror.
That is why Dracula
shattered that mirror.
Look, Professor,
that makes no sense whatsoever.
Dracula is the monster
who killed Lucía Weston.
The same one who left
those marks on Miss Eva's neck.
Him?
Well, believe me that
I do not wish to offend you...
but your words are more like what
one of the patients here would say.
Yes! And the physicians of this
country as well as the police...
will believe that very thing.
What gives vampires their power...
is that people refuse
to believe in them.
But Professor,
according to your own theory...
the vampire must return
to his grave before dawn.
He must return
to his native land...
which is where he was buried.
Now, Count Dracula's native land
is Transylvania.
Then he must have brought
the earth with him.
Perhaps in boxes big enough
to serve as his bed.
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
Renfield, what were you doing
out there?
Come on.
Come with me.
Renfield, did you hear
what we were saying?
Pay attention
to what he is telling you.
That is the only salvation
you have left.
And the same is true
for her.
Save me.
Save my soul.
Save me!
Save me.
Save me!
I am weak.
You are strong.
I am crazy.
You are sane.
I shall save you.
But you must tell us
everything you know.
Everything.
Fool. Fool.
And I thought
you were a wise man.
What do I stand to gain
by telling you everything?
That physician keeps me
locked up here all day.
And when I behave nicely,
he gives me a bit of sugar...
so that I can catch flies.
But if I serve the Master...
An intelligent madman
would rather serve the one...
who can grant him life.
Him?
Who are you talking about?
Why mention names
among friends, Professor?
What kind of ties
do you have with Dracula?
Dracula?
I've never even heard
that name before.
You are lying!
Crazy people, Professor...
do not have the faculty
to distinguish...
between what is true and false.
For that reason,
I do not take offense.
I begged you to let me out...
but you wouldn't do it.
Now it is too late.
It has already happened.
What has happened?
I dare not say it.
I dare not.
I would die in torment
if I tried to.
And you shall die
in torment...
if you let innocent blood
stain your soul.
No!
God will not condemn the soul
of a poor madman.
He knows very well
that the power of evil...
is too great
for those of us with weak minds...
to resist it.
Then, Renfield,
trust me.
Tell me what I want to know.
What do you want to know?
The name of the creature
that has deranged your mind.
The one you call "Master."
No!
Don't ask me that.
Don't ask me that.
No! Don't ask me that!
No! No!
You must tell us!
- You must tell us!
- Leave me alone!
Renfield, tell us
before it is too late.
Before your soul
is damned forever.
I shall tell you.
I shall tell you.
Master! Master!
I was not going
to tell them anything!
I have not told them
anything!
I am faithful to you, Master.
I am faithful.
Dr. Seward! Dr. Seward!
Miss Eva...
over there... dead.
Thank God,
she is still alive.
She is alive,
but she is at great risk.
She is under his influence.
That would be terrible.
I cannot believe it.
Nevertheless, it's true.
We must put an end to it.
We must confront it.
Is Dr. Seward around?
No. What do you need?
That flycatcher
has escaped again...
and he's capable
of any foolishness.
Dr. Seward and his famous
scholar are in the abbey...
chasing vampires.
Vampires. Flycatchers.
Look, Mr. Harker...
if there is a brave man
after my job, he can have it.
I am going to look for work
at another asylum...
where the crazy people
are nice and reasonable.
Let them think
they are Napoleon or kings.
Something worthy of my time.
"The mysterious lady
in white...
that merciless scourge
of childhood...
once again played one
of her tricks last night...
a little after nightfall.
The testimony
given by two girls...
Both confirm
that it is a beautiful lady...
dressed in white...
whose modus operandi
is to offer...
candy to her victim.
She then lures the victim
to a deserted corner...
where she delicately bites
the victim's neck."
What does she know
about the lady in white?
Why would she know anything
about it?
- She should not have read that.
- For God's sake, Mr. Harker!
And when did you see Lucía again
after she was buried?
Once when I was
on the terrace.
She came out of the shadows.
She came towards me.
She stopped
and stared at me.
I began to speak to her.
And then...
I remembered...
that she was dead.
Her face took on
a horrible expression.
Like that of a hungry beast.
As if she were a wolf.
She turned...
and disappeared into the fog
again.
So the lady
dressed in white was...?
Lucía.
Miss, I promise you
that from this day on...
Lucía will rest in peace.
Her soul will be
forever freed...
of that awful appetite.
Since you can save Lucía's soul
after her death...
promise me
that you will save mine, too.
But you're not going to die, my love.
You're going to go on living.
No, no, Juan,
you must not touch me.
And you must not kiss me.
Never, ever.
What are you saying?
Professor, explain it to him.
Tell him.
I can't!
Eva.
Juan, it's over
between the two of us.
Our love, our wedding plans.
Please, Juan,
don't look at me like that.
I love you. I love you more
than anything else.
But this terrible thing.
He wants it to be this way...
and I must obey.
Do you know
what you are doing?
You are driving her crazy.
Mr. Harker, you should be
worried about what's out there.
The last rays of the sun
are gone.
Night hovers over us again.
We have already put wolfbane
in this room and in your bedroom...
to free you from Dracula,
in case he comes back.
She's going to be free of him...
because either she returns with me
to London or I call the police.
Seward, my friend,
I must be in charge here...
or whatever I do
will be useless.
Miss Eva must keep this branch
of wolfbane with her in her bed.
Be careful that she doesn't drop it
while she sleeps.
Under no circumstances must those
windows be opened during the night.
I understand, Professor.
Come, my daughter.
Come on.
Yes, Master.
You have come back, Master.
Are you angry with me?
No! No, Master!
Please!
Not her!
Never again!
No, Master!
No! Not her!
No!
Please!
No, Master!
No, please!
Mr. Harker...
Though I have devoted my life
to the study of the strangest things...
little known facts which the world
is perhaps better off not knowing.
I also accept everyday things.
Dracula's name is associated
with a legend...
that is still told among
his fellow countrymen.
The legend tells
of an ancient family...
that disappeared
over five centuries ago...
and was said
to be made up of vampires.
Since I discovered, by chance...
that Dracula cast no reflection
in the mirror, and that in addition...
three large boxes
had been sent to Carfax Abbey...
and since I also knew that a vampire
must sleep during the day...
in his native earth...
I understood at once that
Dracula had to be the person...
whom Renfield calls "Master."
One of the undead
who has been able...
to prolong his life
beyond its natural limits...
by feeding on the blood
of other living creatures.
The only way we can save Eva...
is by finding the place...
where the living corpse
of the vampire rests...
and driving a stake
through its heart.
What a strange conversation
for men who are not crazy.
Renfield, you will force me
to put you in a straitjacket.
I am afraid that it will be
useless at this point.
What?
What are you saying, Doctor?
Again?
I'm on my way, sir.
Right away, Doctor.
The doctor's favorite lunatic
is at large again.
My goodness! This barbarian
must be Hercules himself.
- What has he done now?
- Come and see for yourself.
From now on...
any mental suggestion
that you receive from me...
must be carried out.
Whenever I want you
to do something...
it has to be done.
It has to be done.
When you come out
of this state...
you will remember nothing
of what I am telling you now.
Do you understand?
I understand.
I have already told you
what you must do.
Now...
obey.
Renfield, you know
where those boxes are.
Tell us
and we shall protect you.
But I no longer need
your protection.
The Master
is not angry with me.
On the contrary,
he is pleased.
He came to my window...
in the moonlight
and promised me things.
Not to say them.
To do them.
- To do them?
- Yes!
To make them happen.
A red mist
spread over the lawn...
and came towards me
like a raging fire.
Then the Master
parted the mist...
and revealed before my eyes
thousands of rats...
their eyes inflamed like his own,
but smaller.
He raised his hand
and they all stopped.
I felt he was telling me:
Rats! Rats!
Rats! Thousands,
millions of rats!
And in each one of them,
a life...
full of red blood...
promising many years of life.
I shall give you
all those beings!
Yes! And many more!
For countless generations!
But you have to obey.
What did he want you to do?
What has already been done.
Dracula is in this house.
Where else
did you expect him to be?
He will not be able
to cause any harm.
We've placed wolfbane
in the rooms.
So here you are!
For God's sake! This man
is going to drive me crazy.
He twisted and broke
the iron bars...
as if they were toothpicks.
Come with me, Martín.
Let me show you a place from
which he will not escape again.
Let's go.
You may be right, but I still say
what St. Thomas said.
Van Helsing.
And now that you've learned
what you've learned...
it would be wise
to return to your country.
I intend to stay
and protect those...
you would like
to destroy.
You're too late.
Dracula's blood is already
flowing in Miss Seward's veins.
She will live
for all eternity...
as I myself have.
Should you escape, Dracula...
we know how to save
Miss Eva's soul...
if not her life.
Of course I'm all right.
I have never felt better...
in my whole life.
Tell me... why are you
staring at me like that?
You're so...
I can hardly believe it.
You look like a different woman.
Darling, you look terrific.
And I feel terrific.
But it is stuffy in here.
And this smell.
It is the wreath of flowers
the professor wanted me to...
Marta!
Yes, Miss?
Throw away that awful wreath
of flowers, will you, Marta?
And please open the windows
and let some fresh air in.
But, Miss, the Professor
will not approve of that.
Do not worry about him.
It's much nicer out here.
I am glad
to see you like this.
I was really
worried about you.
I don't know...
what was wrong with me.
It's as if...
I'm waking from a nightmare.
Juan, the moonlight
is beautiful, isn't it?
Look. Have you ever seen
so many stars?
Millions and millions.
And they seem to be so close...
as if you could reach out
and touch them.
Would you like me to offer you
a handful of them?
Do not forget, Van Helsing,
that over the years...
those who crossed my path...
paid for it with their lives...
and some of them
in very unpleasant ways.
Come...
here!
Stop!
You shall not move your hand
unless I want you to.
Take out whatever you have in there
and put it in this box.
Hurry up.
- Have you obeyed me?
- Yes, I have.
- Yes, you told me.
- No, I didn't.
What do you mean?
I could have never told you
such a foolish thing.
You made it up.
No, you told me
that the night frightened you.
And what is there about the night
to frighten me?
I love the night.
It's the only time
when I feel I'm really alive.
Be careful, a bat!
It may get tangled in your hair.
Yes, I will.
I will!
- You'll what?
- Me?
I didn't say anything.
I thought you did.
God, that bat is huge.
Juan...
I want you
to promise me something.
Whatever you want, my love.
Whatever you ask.
That strange professor
and his herbs...
I can't stand them any longer.
Will you do me a favor
and take them away from him?
And the crucifix.
Take it away from him, too.
He's say he wants
to protect me again.
From the night,
from Count Dracula.
From whatever.
I don't know
what to believe.
But he might be right.
He told me some terrible things
about that Count Dracula.
What is it?
What's wrong with you?
Why?
Your eyes. They look at me
in such a strange way.
Don't! Eva!
Eva, my daughter!
It's all right, Eva.
My love.
The cross. Juan!
After what's happened,
I can't look at it.
But... what's happened?
I cannot tell you!
I cannot!
You must tell me.
I have a right to know.
Dracula.
He came.
He opened a vein in his arm...
and he forced me...
to drink.
What is it?
Who is it, Martín?
A bat, Professor.
Very big and very black.
Don't waste your pellets.
It is useless.
You'll never harm that bat.
What can we do?
He is crazy.
They are all crazy.
All of them,
except me and you.
And sometimes
I even have my doubts about you.
It was a good deed...
to drive a stake through
the heart of that poor girl.
Now her soul will rest
in peace.
Let us go to the abbey.
Look!
An opening in the wall.
Master!
Master, here I am!
Here I am!
Eva! Eva!
Eva! Eva!
He entered through here.
I didn't bring them here, Master!
I swear!
I didn't know!
Master!
Master!
Wait!
Master! Master!
I have always been faithful!
I am your slave.
I did not betray you!
Don't kill me, Master!
Punish me! Torture me!
But let me live!
I cannot go before God...
with so many deaths
on my conscience...
and so much blood
on my hands!
He came in through here!
Eva! Eva!
Use this crowbar, Harker!
I've got it.
Eva, we're here!
Eva! Eva!
Eva! Eva!
Harker! Harker!
I found them.
Look.
His life as a vampire...
is coming to its end.
What about Eva?
You must be brave.
Find me a stone.
Anything...
I can use
to drive the stake...
through his heart.
What about Eva?
Is she...?
She is not here.
Then she is still alive!
Where are you?
Eva! Eva!
Where are you?
Eva! Eva!
You're safe, Eva!
You're safe.
Oh, Juan!
You should have seen
the horrible look on his face...
when he saw the sunlight.
There is nothing
to fear now.
Dracula is dead
forever.
Aren't you coming?
I'm staying behind.
I shall make good
on my promise to Renfield.
The End
