I won't say it's my birthday.
I should be...
Dammit...
Nothing's going right.
Not at all.
Not one bit.
But that's not my fault!
What should I do?
I'm falling apart.
I might be done for.
That's not my fault!
I'll brush my teeth!
My lovely teeth!
Yes, I'll wear cheerful clothes!
Something that feels
good, like this.
I remember when I had nothing.
Nothing at all.
It's a mistake I'm here now.
But why is that my fault?
Are you well, sister?
Is it sunny in heaven?
No butterflies.
Butterflies are free.
The lizard in this
bottle can never escape.
It's grown too big for it.
The butterflies left.
I'm a virgin.
A virgin, but a whore.
A whore, but a virgin.
I must be one or the other.
But women lose their virginity.
Not just whores.
Fuck her more.
Harder.
Much harder!
Much more!
Much more!
Much more!
Much harder!
Much more!
Much more!
Much more!
Have I shit yet today?
Not yet.
I've hardly pissed either.
Pissing and shitting
are important.
All I did was vomit.
That's so good!
Oh! You were there
the whole time?
What are you doing?
Me? I'm always alone.
Aren't you too?
No, I'm not like you. I'm
an independent woman.
Alone and independent are
completely different!
Good morning.
'Morning.
What's wrong? It's a nice day.
You look gloomy.
Okay! Read me today's schedule.
From 10:30am, an interview
with fashion magazine Celine.
By Watanabe, the editor.
Cover photo shoot too.
That bitch? Who's
the photographer?
One Hundred.
That weird-named windbag?
From 11:30am, TV travel
show "Canoe Chime".
From 12am, a lunch meeting
with Bungei Shunju.
Then a New York Times interview.
From 1pm, a Gendai Bijutsu
interview and cover shoot.
This woman...
And this woman...
How unsightly their faces are.
They lack ambition.
From 3pm, a meeting...
These paintings need
stronger subjects.
They fail.
This woman has no menace.
No sex appeal.
Above all, no sincerity.
No sincerity for Eros.
No Thanatos in her eyes.
I sense no demonic impulse, no
devotion to Mephistopheles.
From 5pm, a TV documentary:
"Capturing Kyoko as a Creator".
Who was the model? Who was it?
Mitsuko Sato.
That dumb skank?
No wonder it looks ugly.
That bitch who spits and
swears at everybody?
She can't act for shit, but takes
an eternity to get made up.
She's no actress. Nor a woman.
Nor a tranny.
She's lower than a rat.
Ma'am, your doctor said...
Shut your mouth, hag!
Hey old bitch. What
would you know?
You can't understand my
struggle, you old bitch.
Sundays are too dreary.
Are you a sad purple whore
with immortal crystal eyes?
Are you a whore?!
Could you be one?
I'd like to.
You'd like to?
Yes. I'd like to be a whore.
You can't be a whore!
You've got no purity. You
just foam at the mouth.
Know what "whore" means?
Only women so pure it breaks
their heart can be whores.
This actress...
can't play a whore!
Ma'am, your precious art...
This is precious?! This?
- Watch this.
- Ma'am, please stop!
You're not angry.
I live for you, ma'am.
Good luck with that!
On your knees.
Yes ma'am.
Get on all fours!
Bark like a dog!
Bark more!
Walk like a dog!
Bark!
Yeah! You need a collar!
Good girl!
Good good good!
Un, deux, trois!
Yeah, stay in rhythm.
Un, deux, trois!
Un, deux, trois!
Un, deux, trois!
Want to be a whore?
Ma'am...
I want to be a whore.
You do? You want to
be a whore like me?!
I want to be a whore like you.
Lick me!
S-sorry?
Lick my legs!
Yes ma'am!
Lick them more.
While reading today's schedule.
Yes ma'am.
From... 10:30am...
an interview with...
â€œfashion magazine Celine...
for one hour...
From 11:30am...
TV travel show Canoe...
Chime.
Bungei Shunju...
This is vile. Totally vile.
Die! Die! Die!
Die! Everything die!
It's punishment time.
Ma'am!
Ma'am!
You can't be a whore yet!
You're just a mutt!
You're lower than
a dead cockroach!
Good to see you.
Editor Watanabe and
One Hundred are here.
Long time no see, Kyoko. You're
killing it today. Awesome.
I wanted to meet you, Kyoko.
You're awesome! Exciting!
This is superb as always.
Her last show was a hit.
And her novel's amazing.
Model Emi Wakabayashi. Actress Eriko.
Delightful!
Machi Sawatari. Scary!
Yumi Nikaido. Cute!
I'll shoot you here!
Hey! Bring me my damn camera!
This won't do. This
color isn't real.
Hey mutt.
Mutt!
Yes ma'am?
Give me your blood. Slit
your wrist with that knife.
Oh my. Good lord. Exciting!
That's so... cool.
Only real blood is vivid enough.
Isn't that right, One Hundred?
Exhilarating!
Thrilling.
Okay! Slit it now.
- I've slit it.
- Come quickly!
Yes ma'am.
No, no.
On all fours, mutt.
Yes ma'am.
Noriko.
Your blood is quite tainted.
It's vile.
Dog's blood. It will only
ever be dog's blood.
You there!
Yes?
Give me your blood.
What? May I?!
Please do. Please grant her wish.
If you'd be so kind.
Ma'am, that's...
Wait. Do it. It's an honor.
It's lovely!
Exciting!
Slit it, slit it!
Slit it right open.
Noriko, get naked!
Yes ma'am.
You've never known freedom.
Not with that body.
I see your lust beneath
your lewd skin.
I'm sorry.
Get on all fours.
Receive her blood!
Yes ma'am.
Keep crawling, you lusty bitch!
Yes ma'am.
Lovely.
This is lovely.
Hey you. Rape that mutt!
A mutt released into
a world of mutts.
Come on.
Do it quickly.
Quickly.
Do your worst.
Yes ma'am!
Quickly! Firmly!
Wetted by a dog's tongue.
What? Can't hear.
This will change the air.
Into a vacuum!
Okay, I'll shoot you now!
Ma'am, as a female author...
Drop "female". I'm an author.
Japanese always add "female".
Female author, female
potter, female politician!
Men use such terms!
Men don't sit when they piss.
We always sit on the toilet.
They piss standing up. Men
even look down on toilets.
Forgive me.
You debuted as an author
and rose to stardom.
You began this unique style
of work one year ago.
To flesh out your characters.
You're amazing!
Put simply,
you start by painting your
characters on canvas.
Right? Just like this.
After thoroughly transferring
their essence to canvas,
they surround you,
and you at last begin to write your novel.
A bold method,
much talked about.
Fantastic. A
luxuriant technique.
What's more,
each one of these canvases
featuring your characters
is exhibited following the
publication of your novel.
We the public read your novels,
then encounter your characters
at your exhibition.
Such an emotional journey...
It intensifies the afterglow
from reading your novels.
To date, this style has produced
four novels and exhibitions.
You've made breakthroughs as a
novelist, and as a modern artist.
That's right! For my new novel,
I auditioned many actors, and
selected the most talented.
Don't say "actresses". They're actors.
Actors.
I turn actors into
my characters,
clothe them, and
style their hair!
The bare trunk of my synopsis
branches out intricately!
Your new novel looks
like another gem.
It'll be my best ever!
What is its theme?
Theme?!
Don't annoy me with that.
People's lives don't
have a theme.
I admit that when I'm in a car,
my theme is my destination.
But when I'm in a
car, I masturbate.
When I masturbate, I
think of many things.
My true theme is not
my destination.
What is it?
I take the annoying
freedoms that restrict me,
and flush them down the sewer.
This nation's paltry
freedom of speech
gets thrown in a pile of shit.
Freedom torments
this nation's women.
Deceived by freedom, they
praise freedom of speech,
but not one of them can master it.
Got that?
No woman in this nation...
No woman in this nation
can master freedom!
Freedom's servants, freedom's
slaves, freedom's puppets,
forced to act as
if they're free!
They lack even the freedom of the
cheapest hooker on the street.
At freedom's mercy.
Right, mutt?!
Savor the freedom
of a lowly mutt!
Are you a whore?
No.
I'm not... a whore.
When will you be one?
I want to... someday.
I'm the world's greatest whore!
So shoot me, as I am now!
That's lovely! Delightful!
Lovely! So lovely!
Noriko, become a whore!
More.
Pleasure her more!
- Yes ma'am!
- More!
More!
My brush!
My brush! Where?!
MY brush! Where?! My brush!
My brush! My brush!
I'll pound this emotion
into my canvas!
Cut!
That's a cut!
Open the doors!
Oh man, this is bullshit.
Get me some tea?
Sorry, me too.
What are you doing here, Kyoko?
She doesn't get it at all.
Why are you here?
- Yes sir.
- Not "yes sir", cunt!
You're Kyoko, no?
She's out of her league.
- Right?
- Well...
You're Kyoko, got it?
Kyoko! Kyoko! You've
got to be Kyoko!
You're a pain in the ass. Act
like you're Kyoko, dammit!
We're sick of it.
I'm sorry.
You're shit!
If you can't do it,
I can play your role for you.
- You fucking nobody!
- I'm sorry!
Don't piss off a
veteran like Noriko!
Oh, fuck!
You're wasting our damn time!
Shit...
Director! I'm only gonna
do it one more time, okay?
_ Hey Kyoko. _ Yes?
You fix my hair!
You messed it up.
It's okay. Leave it to me.
Where are you going?!
You fucking crybaby!
I'm so pathetic.
Dumb bitch.
I'm sorry.
How did you get the lead role?
Quit sniveling. Can
you do the sex scene?
I can.
- You're a virgin, right?
- I'm not.
Can you convey pleasure?
Show me here.
Moan, dammit.
More!
Show pleasure! You've had sex!
You're not a virgin!
Are you kidding me?
Get it right.
I'm sorry.
Move.
Outta the way!
I'm sorry.
Lower the right light!
Fix it and we'll go!
Clear the camera's view!
There's a shadow!
Ready to roll! Scene
6, cut 31, take 2!
Let's go!
I can end you anytime I like.
I'll do my best.
"I'll do my best."
Fuck that! Get on your
knees and lick my legs.
Don't dick around. Do it, Kyoko.
On your knees and lick her legs!
Do it!
More! Make her feel it!
Yes sir!
More!
I like it!
Time to roll!
Noriko, let's do it.
Alright. Let's do it.
Get up, shithead!
Noriko, we'll go from
before your rape by her.
Alright.
Scene 6, cut 31, take 2!
Ready!
Action!
Noriko, get naked.
Yes ma'am.
Totally naked?
You bet your ass!
You're worthless trash,
unworthy of becoming a whore!
You look down on
whores, don't you?
Don't you? Say yes.
- Yes ma'am.
- Don't fuck with me!
I'm sorry.
You filthy slut.
You've never known freedom,
not with that body.
On your knees, and
crawl over here!
Say it like you mean it!
This show will be my
most wonderful ever...
What's the theme?
Lovely, Kyoko! Now, pose for me!
I take the annoying
freedoms that restrict me,
and flush them down the sewer.
"This nation's paltry
freedom of speech
gets thrown in a pile
of shit." Continue.
Freedom torments
this nation's women.
Deceived by freedom, they
praise freedom of speech,
but not one of them can master it.
Got that?
"Got that?
"No woman in this nation
can master freedom.
"Freedom's servants,

They lack even the freedom of the

At freedom's mercy.
Right, mutt?!
Savor the freedom of a mutt!
Are you a whore?
We're done here!
Cut!
Break time.
Lights stay as is!
Fuck! I can't stand
this cunt's acting!
No more for today.
It's okay, Kyoko. Just
start over again.
You did fine.
Yes. You can do it.
You did fine.
Remember that time.
I feel ashamed.
I'm a failure.
Completely.
Even if I go easy on myself.
Go on without me.
It's beyond me.
Go on without me.
I can't do it.
Because I'm useless.
Please forgive me.
I was too flawed
as an individual.
Even if I go easy on myself.
Go on without me.
It's beyond me.
Go on without me.
I can't do it.
Because I'm useless.
Please forgive me.
I was too flawed,
as an individual.
Good morning.
Is something wrong?
Shut up, cow!
Hurry up and die! Majorly die!
Totally die!
Intensely die! Hurry up! Any way!
intensely die!
Endlessly die! All
you do is lie!
Everything's a lie!
Die liars, die! I'll die too!
Die, everybody! You can
die, and so can I!
Endlessly die!
Endlessly, rapidly, die!
Camera crew, die! Director, die!
Movie, die!
Where are they?!
Sorry? Who are... they?
They're the camera crew!
Camera crew? What do you mean?
Hey, this is a movie! A drama!
A long, long drama!
An endless nightmare.
The viewers are grinning
and enjoying my plight.
In their seats, grinning.
This isn't my life! This
isn't my existence.
This woman's a total
whore, and it's her fault.
Just like every
whore in the world!
My life revolves
around normality.
My life is normal, but I'm
playing this character,
and this is a stage somewhere!
I'm performing her life.
This insane woman.
Even so,
this isn't my life!
Are you alright?
Hey.
If the director calls cut soon,
will you shout at me again?
You'll scold me, and
I'll go back again.
To humiliating reality.
Soon,
the editor and photographer will come.
Please perk up.
Hey, what do you think about that?
I shot myself having sex!
Having lurid, filthy sex!
Look at me!
From space, our lives look
as insignificant as trash.
Don't they?
Space is always freezing
cold, like inside a fridge.
From space, my life looks
like it lasts a second.
No, not even that.
You're wrong.
You are...
living each second.
Know what death row prisoners
think when they're executed?
"The world is
wonderful," apparently.
There are many...
reasons to live.
I exist.
I exist here.
I know I exist.
I exist,
but not today.
Today comes constantly.
It'll come until I die.
But I don't exist today.
We don't exist in the
todays we've lost.
It appears as if we do,
but we don't.
What about my genitalia?
Your genitalia is
your genitalia.
Your genitalia is
your genitalia.
Will a man's genitalia enter
my genitalia someday?
It Will.
A man's genitalia will enter
your genitalia, and darken it.
That's right. Your genitalia will
be tainted, and darken like mine.
Do men shove their genitalia
into prostitutes too?
They don't.
They insert their cocks.
Genitalia and cocks aren't the same.
Not at all.
Why do I like reading
about cocks and cunts?
Because it's obscene.
It's very indecent.
At night, I peeped
into your bedroom.
I saw Mom sucking your cock,
then you put it in her
cunt and she loved it.
I peeped a lot.
I love this whore's cunt.
I love this pussy hound's cock.
Sucking it, or fucking it.
So why are books and movies
about cocks and cunts bad?
They're very obscene.
They're very indecent.
Mom?
I thought a lot yesterday.
About what? Tell me.
I'm...
thinking of dying.
Because of your grades?
Work hard to earn your
teachers' praise.
Kill me with this today.
Don't start with that again.
I don't want to live.
Okay? Quickly.
Please.
Please kill me.
Do it. Stab me today.
It's over.
It's all over.
Everything's come to an end.
I'm going crazy.
It's always like
this at the end.
I'll die.
I'm pretty sure I'll die.
People don't understand.
They'll never understand.
No approaching the
Diet Building!
Walk only where permitted!
Kyoko?
All butterflies fly away.
Large Scale Protest
Against Security Bills.
You'll play the lead
in my new novel.
A manipulative villainess
who treats men like bugs.
Make a nastier face.
Yes ma'am.
Hey. Are you having good sex?
No ma'am.
You've got to have good sex!
I had a ton of sex
back in high school.
I treated men like bugs.
Me toy with men?
I was too uptight for that.
You should've done it anyway!
I'm sorry.
Strip off.
- Sorry?
- Strip off.
Nice. Nice body.
You've got to use it.
And abuse it.
Use it properly.
This, and this.
This nation's women don't
master their hearts.
Or master their flesh.
Men control them,
and male society
overwhelms them.
It exhausts them.
I'm in love!
With Who?
You, ma'am.
I'm in love.
Kiss me.
Kiss me harder!
Stay right there!
I'm worthless.
I haven't matured at all.
Not since I was a kid.
- Hang in there.
- Don't doubt yourself.
Stick at it.
I can't even be a virgin.
Or a whore.
I'm shit. Worthless.
I want to be a man.
So I can kill all of them!
- Kill them.
- Kill them all.
Good morning.
From 10:30am, interview and cover
shoot with fashion mag Celine.
From 11:30am, TV travel
show "Canoe Chime".
At a young age...
I realized my mom and
dad were having sex.
Sorry?
They had sex, thinking
I was asleep.
Everyone has sex.
They always...
said negative things
to me about sex.
They filled me with shame.
That's what parents do.
But every night,
I could hear them having sex.
It troubled me.
Why was I...
Good to see you.
Whore! How've you been?
Miss whore, how are you?
This whore's fine!
'Morning everyone!
My life has revolved
around sex, so today,
I'll show you how I
lost my virginity.
I was an uptight girl,
raised by very strict,
boring parents.
I see nothing, whore!
You see nothing? You see me!
The dirty whore!
Showing nothing is despicable.
You see nothing? Nothing at all?
You see nothing?
How can that be?!
It's just not possible!
You see nothing?
You see nothing?
No, that can't be.
That can't be. It can't.
Cut!
That can't...
This is bullshit!
- Break time!
- Director!
Night lights!
You see nothing?
Recast her part.
Fire her already.
That can't be...
You see nothing? Nothing at all?
You see nothing.
You see nothing.
How can that be...
Nothing...
I'm home.
Hello dear.
Did school finish early?
I'm starring in a movie.
- A movie?
- That's right.
Don't be silly. When did
you become an actor?
I'm new. I won an audition.
Oh please! You never told me.
What's going on?
School finished early?
Hey, she says she was
acting in a movie all day.
A movie?
What? You were acting?
I won an audition.
An audition? When was that?
I kept it secret. Amateurs were
okay, so I lied and said I'm 20.
Oh my...
What kind of movie?
A sex scene every 10 minutes.
What?!
You have a sex scene?!
I had it.
Quit at once!
No way.
What's wrong with you?!
I'm 18 now! I see you and
her having sex everyday!
My real mom died
a long time ago.
I don't mind you remarrying,
but you're always horny.
Watch your mouth!
I don't want to badmouth you.
Just let me be.
I'm me! I'm a woman too.
A woman just like you!
Good! Keep it up!
What on earth?!
You're a man! I'm a woman.
Come on Dad, take me.
I'll take Mom's place!
What are you doing?!
Hey! Stop it!
Daddy!
Stop it!
- Stop it!
- Good!
This is wrong!
Take my virginity!
It's wrong!
Come on! Come!
Hey, would you
take my virginity?
Sure.
Will here do?
Be gentle!
You're a virgin?
I am.
A virgin, huh. I'll
be your first?
I'll be so brutal
you'll never forget!
Be gentle!
No, I'll rape you!
Stop it!
It's too late!
Stop it, please!
I can't stop!
Stop it, asshole!
Fuck you, ugly bitch!
Stop it! Get off!
Asshole!
Please! Hey! Can
we grind instead?
That'd be easier.
Really?
Leave it to me.
What do I do?
Get between my legs. Then move.
Yes. Yes! Isn't that good?
Where's the crew?
Hey!
Where'd you go?!
Name?
Kyoko Suzuki. I'm 20.
Virgin?
No. Just one messy experience.
In a forest with some guy.
When was that?
After an argument.
Why did you apply?
So I can get naked.
And have lots of sex.
You don't get it, do you?
This is a roman porno film.
Know what that means?
That's why I applied.
Director, she won't be
convincing as a whore.
I want to be a whore!
Take your clothes off.
Do you like your body?
My nudity isn't porn.
Please make it porn!
It's not smutty.
Please make it smutty!
Please make my body into porn!
Your body is plenty smutty.
My nakedness isn't smutty.
Men look at me like a stray cat
looks at stale breadcrumbs.
Stray cats eat when they can.
I'm emergency food.
Look into that box there.
Yes sir!
What's your most painful memory?
My younger sister's death.
She played the piano so well.
Good morning.
You're late.
I'm sorry.
Are you a whore?
Could you be one?
I'd like to.
You'd like to be a whore?
Yes ma'am.
I'd like to!
Ma'am, your doctor said...
Shut your mouth!
What would you know?
You can't understand
my struggle.
Sundays are too dreary.
Are you a sad purple whore...
with immortal...
crystal eyes?
Are you a whore?
Could you be one?
Get on all fours.
Yes ma'am.
Bark like a dog.
Walk like a dog.
Bark!
Bark!
Yeah.
You need a collar.
Un, deux, trois!
Un, deux, trois!
Un, deux, trois!
Un, deux, trois!
My sister's not here!
Where is she?
She's not here!
She's not here! Where is she?
- What's that?
- She's not playing piano!
- What?
- She's not playing piano!
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she? Where?
Where's my sister?!
Where's my sister?!
Well?
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Where is she?
Where's my sister?!
You can't be a whore.
You're just a mutt!
"You can't be a whore.
You're just a mutt!"
"Kyoko repeatedly hits
Noriko with her belt.
"Noriko looks ecstatic.
"Sweat runs down her neck, and
Kyoko watches, spellbound.
Then the doorbell rings."
Good to see you!
Editor Watanabe and
One Hundred are here.
"Editor Watanabe and
One Hundred enter."
Long time no see. You're
killing it today. Awesome.
I wanted to meet you.
You're awesome!
"The photographer
embraces Kyoko."
Awesome!
I declare to them loudly.
I wrote these lines before.
Say them here now.
You say them.
Go on, say them.
Become a whore.
Become a fucking whore!
Say them! Fucking whore!
I take the...
annoying freedoms
that restrict me...
and flush them down the sewer.
This nation's paltry
freedom of speech
gets thrown in a pile of shit.
Freedom...
torments this nation's women.
Deceived by freedom,
they praise freedom of speech,
but not one of them...
can master it.
Got that?!
No woman in this nation...
No woman...
in this nation can
master freedom!
Freedom's servants,
freedom's slaves,
freedom's puppets,
forced to act as
if they're free.
Right, mutt?!
Savor the freedom of a mutt!
Are you a whore?!
It's about a woman in a porno.
She lies to the director
about being a whore
for reasons superior to a
day's worth of Tokyo shit.
The most exquisite,
extravagant shit!
1: This nation's men are shit! 2:
The freedom they created is shit!
3: The world they
dream of is shit!
And me, acting in a
shitty porno, is...
Kyoko?
Happy birthday.
The shitty reason this
shithead calls herself a whore
is superior to a day's worth
of all the shit in Japan!
Far superior!
To exquisite shit!
To extravagant shit!
She has more reasons
than all that shit!
More!
More!
An exit! Where's my exit?!
Give me an exit!
Exit! Exit! Exit!
Give me an exit!
