SHORTA IS AN
ARABIC WORD FOR POLICE
-Let me go!
-Don't move!
I can't breathe!
Stay down, goddammit!
Lie still, for fuck's sake!
-I can't breathe!
-Stay still!
I can't breathe!
15 people have been detained
after violent riots
following the arrest of
19-year-old Talib Ben Hassi,
who was taken to the ICU…
P14. P14. Flying over Svalegården.
No large gatherings.
Nothing to report.
Deputy Chief of Police Birgit Rabech
says the situation is improving.
We are massively present in the area,
and have the youngsters
under control.
Talib Ben Hassi was arrested
after a dramatic car chase,
and was subsequently transferred to
the hospital in critical condition.
-Okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Fine.
-Hi. What's up?
-What's up?
Poulsen, take it easy.
I'll take care of it.
OUT OF ORDER
Hey…
-Broken again?
-Yes. It says disconnected.
Cheap crap. Feeling better?
-Yeah, guess it was just a bug.
-Marianne has been sick, too.
-Not going out on patrol?
-I was gonna do some paperwork.
I want everybody on wheels.
And… by the way…
I'd like you to ride
with Mike Andersen.
I need someone to keep him on a short
leash. Just until this blows over.
Internal Affairs want to talk to
everyone who was on call that night.
-I'll give them a call.
-Good.
My door is always open
if you need to talk.
-Thanks.
-See you in there.
Yep.
-Good morning.
-Morning.
-Here.
-Ah, thanks.
I see you're riding
with Mike Andersen.
I'd rather blow my brains out.
Why don't they take his badge
like with Kofoed and Poulsen?
They'll be back in a week.
They're two professional witnesses,
and there's no one
to dispute their story.
You were working
that night too, right?
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
Thank you to those of you
who came in on your day off.
As you know,
we've had a bit of trouble
with the Talib Ben Hassi situation.
Ben Hassi's condition is stable,
but if that changes,
we expect the riots to escalate,
so that is our primary focus.
Ben Hassi is from Svalegården,
so stay clear of the area.
Unless you have a specific task.
Our presence could escalate
the conflict. Any questions?
-Møller?
-Where are Kofoed and Poulsen?
On forced leave until it's been
determined whether to press charges.
It's normal procedure,
but I'm expecting an acquittal.
-And our lieu days?
-You're getting overtime pay.
Our kids'll forget what we look like.
In your case, that's good, Møller.
-I have something for you.
-It's a bit crooked, isn't it?
Shut it!
I know it's tough
out there right now,
but I'm doing my best to change that.
Remember, we're the people's
only safeguard against total chaos,
so get out there and restore order
before anyone questions that.
You set the agenda.
Have a good shift. And watch
each other's backs out there.
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.
It's gonna be a long day.
Eight hours with Supercop over there.
-I'm more worried about his music.
-Cop rock?
Rock out with your glock out.
Beers are on me after work,
if you need to talk.
If I make it that long.
Have a good one, Rønning.
-Have fun.
-Thanks.
-There he is. Ready to roll?
-Yep.
Good.
POLICE
"VICTIM OF POLICE BRUTALITY?
TALIB ON LIFE SUPPORT"
"Women with big butts
have smarter children." Aha.
Good thing I had kids with my ex.
-Got any kids?
-Not yet.
-Married?
-Yes.
-But no ring?
-Not on the job, no.
Remember when Laursen's ring
got caught on a fence?
-The skin peeled off like a banana.
-Yeah, not good.
Is that why you're not wearing it?
Or are you getting something
on the side? Well?
That's a yes.
P14. APB.
Rocks thrown at police officer.
Suspect described as male,
15-20 years of age, brown skin.
Is it Rønning?
Are you doing it with Rønning?
-I was her field training officer.
-That makes it even hotter.
A bit of teacher-student action.
Good cop, naughty cop
getting frisky down in lock-up.
Piece of crap.
Relax, Høyer.
I'm just fuckin' with you.
Why can't they wrap it properly?
Internal Affairs have launched an
investigation into whether officers
used excessive force
when restraining Talib Ben Hassi.
Fucking witch hunt.
He attacked them first.
Have you seen him? He's big as fuck.
Of course they got on top of him.
And then some dickhead with a desk
gets to decide
if it was right or wrong.
He tore through the city
doing 130 mph.
It's a miracle
he didn't kill someone.
But no one talks about that.
What if he hit a kid?
-Let's listen to something else.
-The driver has the radio.
You've got balls. Fine. You're
in charge of the entertainment.
You haven't said a damn word all day.
And I'm bored out of my skull.
Tell me a story.
What do you wanna know?
Your biggest fuckup on the job.
-I've never fucked up once.
-C'mon, everyone has.
Go on! Spill it.
Well? Come on.
I was still in training…
One day I was sent to the basement
to get a box of CS grenades.
Yeah?
I get the box,
but as I lift it, the pin is pulled
from one of the grenades.
-Shit. What did you do?
-What the hell do you think? I ran.
I slammed the door
and heard a giant bang.
-And one more. And one more.
-They all blew up? Fuck, man!
-Isn't the storage explosion proof?
-Sure.
Armored door and 80-inch-thick walls.
I just thought it was gonna cost me
a lot of cleaning
and a round of beers.
But then I heard
all the fire alarms go off upstairs.
People were running around screaming.
Gas had spread
to the entire building.
-Damn, what a fuckup, man.
-But that wasn't the worst of it.
There's more?
It took half an hour
for someone to remember
the two gypsies down in lockup.
Goddamn…
So they were down there
puking their lungs out? Damn.
Fuck 'em. Fucking gypsies.
Am I right?
That'll fucking teach them.
-Ready to go?
-Sure.
Fucking gypsies, man.
They think they can get a warm bed,
a free meal and Skinemax on TV.
They always commit
their crimes before 7 p.m.
so they don't miss dinner.
A gypsy stealing a roast from a store
costs the state 50,000 kroner.
But if you need a new note pad, you
have to send three applications to…
P14, P14. Inquiry on a vehicle.
Romeo 14-05. Over.
Romeo 14-05. Go ahead.
P14. Vehicle inquiry
on Bravo Mike 79757.
I repeat, BM 79757.
Romeo 14-05. Over.
-What's up?
-Grey Mercedes. It's just a hunch.
Romeo 14-05. Bravo Mike 79757.
Unknown Mercedes E-Class
registered to Hamza Alfarsi. Come.
P14. Copy that. Romeo 14-05. Over.
Osman's car.
Hamza's part of his crew.
Did you see that?
They've spotted us. Make sure they
don't throw anything out the window.
They're heading for Svalegården.
Aren't we supposed to
stay outta there?
There's a minor in the backseat.
SVALEGÅRDEN
NEVER FORGETS
-Wassup, Mike?
-Turn that shit off.
Get out of the car, both of you.
-What the hell do you feed that guy?
-Him? Potatoes.
-Just potatoes?
-Yeah.
Where'd your gangster intern run to?
The only gangster here is you, boss.
-Why was he in your car?
-He's my cousin.
What is it with you boys and perfume?
You smell like a whorehouse.
Or is it your mom, I smell? Huh?
I'm telling you for the last time.
Stay away from the kids. Got it?
You just stay right there.
Of course.
Good.
Great. Now piss off.
Romeo 14-05, we can see
that you're in Svalegården. Come.
P14. We're following up
on a suspicious vehicle.
Romeo 14-05. Over.
Romeo 14-05. Copy that.
Wrap it up and get out.
-When is your deposition?
-I don't know.
I've been through it a few times.
Let me know if you need to talk.
-Sure. Thanks.
-Don't mention it.
Come on, Sami. I can do it.
Iza, we've been over this.
You're not old enough.
-I want to be a Big Brother, Sami.
-I know, but you're not old enough.
Wanna help out? Start cleaning up.
We'll talk about it later. Okay?
Watch out.
-You've got your hands full.
-Yes. He wants to be a Big Brother.
-Shouldn't he ask his parents?
-Not that kind of big brother.
Big Brothers are older boys
who walk our streets at night
to make them safe.
-I didn't expect you to come.
-You called for us?
Old guy's getting kinda fat, huh?
DIE PIGS
Who wrote this shit?
-Hello! Anyone home?
-Why are you asking me?
-Tough guy, huh?
-Yeah, just like you.
Daniel and Iza,
go get some fresh air.
Yallah, come on.
I don't know why you bother.
They have everything
and still trash the place.
-Maybe they just want some attention.
-Right. Play the victim card.
There are no victims here.
We take responsibility
for our actions.
Like when you sat in the backseat
of my squad car?
-Anything else?
-We saw Osman with a kid.
He recruits them right outside,
you know that, right?
-I'll take care of it.
-No, you won't. We will.
Then you should come around more.
Right, we've got
nothing better to do.
Sami! Sami! Hurry outside!
Hey!
Hey. What's going on?
She's trying to make us
sound like ignorant ragheads.
I don't wanna hear that language!
I just asked what you think about
what happened to Talib.
You just want to start some trouble
for your stupid TV show!
-You tried to give me money!
-You can give me some.
-Give me money, man!
-This isn't funny!
We're not done cleaning, guys.
Let's go. Come on.
-Can I ask you a few questions?
-No, please leave.
Don't worry about them.
Is there any truth to the allegations
against the cops
in the Ben Hassi case?
If you have questions, direct them
to our spokesperson, okay? Thank you.
The arrest was described
as a violent assault. Any comment?
-Did you try to bribe them?
-We always pay expert sources.
They don't even have pubes yet.
What the hell are they experts on?
-They deserve to tell their…
-You're just here to stir up trouble.
Isn't that what you're doing?
You have two minutes
to pack up your shit and leave.
Step aside, please.
-Denmark has freedom of the press.
-Look around.
-This isn't Denmark.
-Could you repeat that, please?
-And look straight into the camera.
-If I see you again, you're going in.
Understood?
Sure.
What a dickhead.
Come here, please.
-What?
-Come here.
-Don't.
-No, it's okay.
What did you say?
-That we have freedom of the press…
-What did you say?
That's not a good idea.
Let's go.
-What?
-Nothing.
Fucking bitch.
{\an8}We put on this target every day
so she can sleep soundly at night.
We have to show who's in charge.
Otherwise we can't come in here
without an army watching our backs.
You gotta be on top
of them constantly.
-It's the only thing they understand.
-They're young.
-Didn't you get in trouble as a kid?
-Sure!
But I became a police officer.
They become criminals.
First, they give you the finger.
Then call you names and spit on you.
And one day they shove a gun in your
face. Have you tried that? Have you?!
-No.
-No! You haven't.
But I have. And it sure as shit
changes your perspective.
And when you've been doing this
for as long as I have,
you'll agree with me.
Yes. Okay.
Yes…
Okay.
What the hell
are you looking at, dipshit?
-ID?
-No.
-Name and Social Security number.
-Amos Al-Shami. 0-7-0-6-0-2.
-And the last four…
-I don't have to tell you.
-Got something to hide?
-No, do you? What's your number?
-I should be able to see your number.
-You can have mine.
-Why are you stopping me?
-Stop filming.
Is it against the law?
If it interferes
with police business.
-You stopped me for no reason.
-Listen, Amos.
You're being detained for a search.
Drop your phone and your bag.
-On what grounds?
-You'll find out.
-You don't have the legal authority.
-Wow, those are some fancy words.
-But…
-Shut it,
or I throw your ass in jail.
You don't want that.
Am I right?
This is an illegal search.
Anything in your pockets
I can cut myself on?
-Jacket, shoes and socks.
-Andersen?
Keep an eye on them.
Okay, get moving.
Let's go! We don't have all day.
Are we done?
No. Not quite.
Gotta check those drawers, too.
Drop your pants. Drop your pants.
Come on!
Take 'em off!
Hey! What the fuck is going on?
Nope. Not much to see here.
You eye-fucking me,
you little prick? Are ya?
Wanna hit me?
Well?
I think we're done here.
Yes.
We are now.
Fuck off!
Got something to say?
Fine.
Hey! Stop.
-Let go!
-Stand still!
Throwing things at the police,
you fucking raghead? Huh?
-Where are your buddies?
-I had nothing to do with it!
-Then why did you run?
-You were chasing me!
-Why are we wasting time on this?
-Tell me where they are.
P14. Be advised. Talib Ben Hassi
has died as a result of his injuries.
We anticipate an increase
in activity in our focus areas.
Use caution. Over.
That's what happens when…
Officer in trouble!
Down!

P14. We're being attacked with rocks.
We can't see how many they are. Over.
Romeo 14-05 attacked with rocks.

Repeat, Romeo 14-05.
Come in, Romeo 14-05.
Romeo 14-05, do you copy?
Come on! Come on!
Move!
Fucking animals!
Hey, what's going on?
Police officer. Go back inside!
Go back inside!
Hey, hey! Follow this.
-Does it hurt anywhere?
-No.
P14. P14. Emergency signal.

Our vehicle is wrecked, and we need
help immediately. Romeo 14-05. Over.
Romeo 14-05 have been hit
by rocks and have abandoned vehicle.
Romeo 14-05. I currently have
no squad cars available.
We will notify you of an extraction
point outside Svalegården.
They don't wanna come in here.
They don't wanna
fucking come in here.
Jesus Christ…
Fuck.
Stay right there.
I think this is your size.
-We have to let him go…
-He's coming with us.
He's the only one who knows
where those little bastards are.
-How do we get out of here?
-Why should I tell you?
Shut up. You seem
to know your rights.
'Cause you're always stopping me.
Then you know you can seek damages
for wrongful arrest.
No one will believe me.
You can call me as a witness.
So… how much money can I get?
How do we get out?
-There.
-And where are we now?
There.
-P14. P14. Romeo 14-05. Over.
-Romeo 14-05. Go ahead.
P14. We're heading for
the parking lot on Tornskadevej.
Romeo 14-05. Over.
Romeo 14-05, copy that. Over.
Stop! Stop it…!
Stop!
Stop! Stop! I said stop!
-Stop it!
-Hey!
-Stop! I said stop!
-Hey!
Put that shit down! Put it down!
-Stop!
-Go back in your fucking store!
I've got this. Police! Put that down!
On the ground! Now!
Stay down!
It's your lucky day, you greasy fuck.
I'd put a bullet in that fat belly.
Høyer, got a handle on it?
Come in here! Hurry!
Come on! Hurry!
They're from the police.
About goddamn time.
-Go home. It's not safe here.
-I have to protect my store.
-No. That's our job.
-Like they give two shits about you.
-Mind your own business.
-Hell, no. Do your damn job.
You don't live here.
Those damn Pakis terrorize everyone.
I've known Samir and Nadia
for over 20 years.
Now they have to close their store.
'Cause everyone's
afraid to come here.
-That's not fucking…
-Hey! Shut your trap.
They come here every day.
They steal, they
threaten my customers,
and when I call the police,
nothing happens.
Why do you do it?
Why don't you have any respect?
What are you laughing at?
What do you get out of it?
Hey, calm down. Come here.
-You make friends all over the place.
-Yeah. Envious?
…the death of Talib Ben Hassi.
Ben Hassi was on life support,
but today his family decided
to turn off the respirator.
This has angered immigrant youths,
and 23 have so far been arrested
after violent clashes
with police across the country.
My mom says to give you this.
Many have taken to social media
to voice their outrage.
"My heart bleeds for Ben Hassi,"
tweets politician Frederikke Kjær,
who calls Ben Hassi's death a
disgrace that can never be justified.
What did you do?
Shot a guy who got in my face.
I'm kidding.
I didn't do anything.
The cops are just bored.
Hey.
-Are you okay?
-Sure.
I think we got off
on the wrong foot, Høyer.
That's why the Captain and I
decided we should ride together.
-People talk, you know.
-Oh? And what do people say?
You haven't given your statement yet.
You seem unsure of what to say.
That makes people nervous.
And people do stupid things
when they're nervous.
-Are you threatening me?
-No, no.
Not at all.
We just need to know
if we can count on you.
We both know Kofoed and Poulsen
aren't the hairiest nuts in the sack.
What they did was stupid,
and they know that.
They went too far.
But they only had a split second
to react, and they made a mistake.
Because they were afraid.
Look how fast
you almost lost control before.
They don't deserve to have
their lives destroyed over this.
What about Talib Ben Hassi's life?
We gotta have each other's back
or we won't survive.
And who knows? Maybe you're
the one who needs help next time.
Don't worry. I'll keep my mouth shut.
No. You won't.
You're gonna tell them what happened.
You weren't there.
You were doing paperwork,
emptying the dishwasher,
or jerking off, I don't give a shit.
But you didn't see anything.
Do you understand?
What's going on out here?
AVENGE TALIB
Who sent this?
I don't know.
-What are you doing?
-He got it, too.
-Everyone got it.
-What if they show up here?
-Don't worry, we'll protect you.
-It's safer if you leave.
That's what she's trying to say.
Where have I seen you before?
Did you play soccer
in the Police Youth Club?
My buddy was a coach there for
a while. You were their star player.
Really? This guy?
I could play circles around you.
You couldn't even catch me.
Well, you don't have a bad meniscus
and torn ligaments. What?
You must be an Arsenal fan.
All brown boys love Arsenal.
-And all cops love Real Madrid.
-Who's your best player? Özil?
He gets 3 mil for scratching his ass.
He's better than Benzema.
You just say that
because we stole him from you.
Benzema has won everything.
Arsenal players are such bitches.
They won't do the hard work,
so they never win.
And Real Madrid spends billions
on whore players.
But they're hardcore super whores.
First Ronaldo and now Hazard.
Why don't you play anymore?
-Your buddy kicked me off the team.
-Why? What did you do?
-Nothing.
-Of course. The epitome of innocence.
A guy called Rasmus
kept provoking me.
So I told him to meet me
after practice,
if he had a problem with me.
-Fighting is pretty dumb.
-He never showed up.
He said I threatened him
with a knife.
Did you?
Why don't you just
play somewhere else?
Fuck it. It's a waste of time.
Romeo 14-05. Charlie 14-02 will
arrive at Tornskadevej in 5 minutes.
Do you think that's them?
P14. P14. Romeo 14-05. Come in.
Romeo 14-05. Go ahead.
P14. We're at the contact point.
Can Charlie 14-02 flash their lights?
Romeo 14-05 arrived at contact point.
Charlie 14-02. Flash your lights.
P14. Copy that.
Charlie 14-02. Over.
Møller, you son of a bitch,
this is the first time
I'm happy to hear your voice.
Romeo 14-05.
Someone's gotta save your ass…
You fucking dog!
Think you can get away from us?
We're gonna kill you!
You and your fucking family!
P14. P14. Charlie 14-02 met with
Molotovs. Headed north on foot.
Tornskadevej is blocked.
We can't get out. Romeo 14-05. Over.
Romeo 14-05…
I have nothing to send you.
P14. What do you mean?
What the hell are we supposed to do?
Romeo 14-05. That's your call.
No confirmation. Out.
-Are you okay?
-I can't feel my hands.
They're just asleep.
-Where do you live?
-Solriksvej 37. 14th floor.
Is it far?
We're not getting out of here
anytime soon, and he lives close by.
Maybe we should go to his place
until things settle down.
You wanna hide at his place?
-Yes.
-No.
-Would you rather shoot your way out?
-We'll find another way.
-There is no other way.
-He's not going anywhere.
-This is all your fault.
-You could've stopped me.
You could've stopped Kofoed
and Poulsen. You were right there.
But you didn't do a damn thing.
Right?
Get up. Come. Get up.
You're coming with me.
Wanna get out of the way?
-Cut the shit.
-You're a snake in the grass, Høyer.
Fine. Are you gonna move?
You'd rather protect those jackals
than your own colleagues?
You bet your ass. And I'm gonna tell
everyone what happened to Ben Hassi.
You won't say shit, you little bitch.
Or you'll find out
just how alone you really are.
Fuck you. And fuck your friends.
Where the hell do you think
you're going?!
Had enough?
Cover your eyes! Cover your eyes.
-I can't see anything!
-Don't touch your eyes. It'll pass.
-Just breathe.
-It hurts!
Just breathe.
Is that where you live?
-No… yes.
-Is there a back entrance?
No.
-Hey! What the hell are you doing?
-None of your business!
-Little bitch!
-Get outta here!
Shut your mouth, dumbass bitch!
Fuck you!
Hey, what's going on?
Hey! What is it?
Nothing!
Stay out!
Fucking ragheads!
Can I…
Wait…
Is there someplace else we can go?
-No.
-Okay.
We'll figure something out.
What about your partner?
Is he gonna be okay?
The most important thing
is to get you to safety.
I threw that milkshake at your car.
I know.
But you throw like a bitch.
What are you doing?
You've lost a lot of blood.
You need to sit down.
I'm Abia. I'm a nurse.
The bleeding has stopped.
I've given you a saline drip.
Hi.
What's your name?
Is it a secret?
Okay.
How old are you?
20?
Okay.
37?
Oh, I know. You're 89 years old.
I'm actually five years old.
Wow.
Just like my son. He's five, too.
Hey, you. Back to bed now.
-But it's noisy outside.
-You can sleep in my bed.
Mommy, who's that man?
He hurt himself
and needs a bit of help.
But when's Amos coming home?
He'll be home soon.
2017
TALENT OF THE YEAR
-I think the food is…
-Shit!
-How are you feeling?
-Much better, thank you.
-Are these your kids?
-Uhm… yes.
Amira, whom you've met
and Amos… my son.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He should've been home by now.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.
-It won't be a culinary feast…
-No, no. I don't want to intrude.
You need to eat something.
VIOLENT RIOTS
…a different situation with cars
and containers on fire
and rocks and fireworks
being aimed at police.
Hundreds of people have left flowers
where Talib Ben Hassi was arrested.
Talib Ben Hassi's mother,
Rose Ben Hassi, spoke to us earlier,
and pleaded with both police
and protestors to stop the violence.
Don't fight because of Talib.
Talib wasn't violent.
He was a sweet and happy boy.
He was a good brother and son.
And now I'll never see him again.
Don't fight in his name.
I don't want any more parents
to lose their children.
More than 60 have been arrested, and
more than 30 protesters and officers
have been injured in what is called
the worst riots in Denmark ever.
Do you have kids?
Yes.
My mother used to say
that being a parent
is like having your heart walk
around in the world unprotected.
He's a good boy. Amos.
He's just always so angry.
And I get it. No matter what he does,
it's never good enough.
If you're always treated like
something you're not,
you end up believing it.
But I'm sure you already know that.
I'm sure your son is all right.
Yes…
You think you can shoot at us,
you fucking faggot?
Do you wanna die?!
Do you wanna die?!
Do you?!
Don't look at him! He can't help you!
You're all alone now, fucking pig.
No one's gonna help you!
Amos, get his gun.
Take his fucking gun!
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing, man?!
Get back.
Get the fuck away now!
Relax.
Calm down. Come on.
Leave him.
Leave him.
Come on.
MOM
Why do you have Amos's phone?
-Where is my son?
-He's with my colleague.
He threw something at our car
so we had to arrest him.
We tried taking him home,
but we got separated.
They were on their way here…
Something must've happened.
-Help!
-Be quiet!
Be quiet! Quiet.
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you!
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Look at me. Look at me.
Abia?
-I'll find Amos. I promise.
-Abia? Open the door.
-I'll get your son home.
-Abia, open the door.
-Mommy?
-Abia? Are you okay?
Open the door! Abia!
Abia!
Abia, what's going on?
Kick down the door.
If you're behind the door, move away!
Step back. Police. Step back.
-What the fuck is going on?
-Stay out of it.
-Where's Abia? What's happening?
-Stay out of it! Shut the fuck up!
-Go back inside.
-Don't fucking tell me what to do!
-Fuck you!
-Move! Move!
Why are you just standing there?!
That's right.
Keep walking, you loser!
Abia? Amira? Where are you? Abia?
What's up, Mike?
-Go back inside.
-You're knee-deep in shit, huh?
Do you have shit in your ears?
Go back inside!
Now!
Is that supposed to be a real gun?
Wanna find out?
Well?
Shut the door.
Shut the door!
Go get him, boy.
Fuck…
-We have to help him.
-Yeah, right. It's a fucking cop.
-Check it out.
-It's not a toy!
Relax, man. I got this.
It's not a real gun.
-Weren't you told to stay home?
-Who else is gonna help you?
-How did you find me?
-It wasn't that hard.
You're being watched.
Do you know where my partner is?
No. But we can help you find him.
Why would you help me?
If a cop gets hurt in here,
everything will just get much worse.
Go on home.
I can get a car!
-Man, you suck at driving.
-Shut up!
Step on the clutch.
It's to the left of the brakes.
Release it and push down
the gas pedal.
-Whose car is this?
-My dad's.
-Does he know you're driving it?
-No.
He doesn't care anyway.
POLICE
-Man, they totally ripped it off.
-Shut the fuck up, man.
P14. P14.
Romeo 14-05. Alpha. Come in.
Romeo 14-05. Alpha. Go ahead.
P14. I'm still in Svalegården.
I don't know where
my colleague is. Over.
Romeo 14-05 Alpha. Copy that.
Switch to a closed channel.
Fuck.
Throw the blanket over him. Hurry!
What's up, boys?
Driving around in Daddy's car?
-Have you seen those two cops?
-No.
-What about your friend?
-He hasn't seen them either.
Can't he speak for himself?
Get out. Get out.
-Me?
-Yeah, who else? Get lost.
-What do you want? I'm busy.
-Relax.
We're just gonna have a little talk.
What's that? Huh?
Let me know if you want a real one.
And don't tell Sami.
He wants you to be
a good little Arab,
but that's not how you get respect.
-You should also have self-respect.
-Are you saying I don't have that?
Well?
That Big Brother crap
doesn't mean shit.
But we do.
And we need someone like you, Iza.
You're not a kid anymore. Are you?
-No.
-Good. That's good.
So tell me…
Where's that fucking cop?
Don't play dumb with me.
What the fuck are you looking at?
Come on!
That was insane, man!
You blasted all of them!
-I owe your dad a new car.
-It was a piece of crap anyway.
Here. This is for you.
You'd make a great cop.
Høyer, do you read me? Mike. Over.
Høyer, do you read me? Mike. Over.
Look.
-Is that happening now?
-I'll show you where it is. Let's go.
Come on!
Keep up! Let's go! Come on!
Come on!

-They're over there! Come on!
-Wait, Iza!
Police! Show me your hands!
Jens?
Jens?
Jens.
What happened?
I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?
He came out of nowhere.
I thought he was one of them.
I can't go to jail, Mike.
I can't.
Mike…
He was armed and about to shoot.
You acted in self-defense. Say it.
Hey! Say it.
He was armed,
I acted in self-defense.
That's right. This never happened.
Thank you.
You dropped this.
Where's Amos?
Did he see it?
Yes.
You need to get outta here.
Go on.
Your mom's waiting…
Go on.
You wanna end up like him?
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna die?
Get the hell out of here! Get out!
Go!
Go!
