I'm OK, OK?
Everything's cool.

Lover boy's waiting.

Just two Greek girls
looking for a good night out.

raped my great-grandmother.
[Laughter]
- You like Greek music?
[Laughter]
[Greek music plays on radio]
[screams]
- I love this song.
It's so fucking cute.
- You don't even know
what this song's about.
- You know this song?
The road has its own story.
There is one word painted on the wall.
- Freedom.
- They say the story
was written by the youth.
- That's very romantic.
- It's important to remember.
Those students struggled.
They gave up their lives.
- Polytechnic is history.
It happened a long time ago.
[Cab driver] It was not so long ago.
- It's a pity they all forgot
what the struggle was for.
- Freedom.
[Yawns]
Some people talk about it.
Some people live it.
- [Johnny] You Turks are just like the
Greeks.
One life and it's all politics.
[Sirens]
- [taxi driver] Shit.
[Speaking foreign language]
What have I taken?
- A cocktail, sugar.
Something to make you fly.
- Don't say anything, Johnny.
- You realize
you just went through a red light, driver?
- Really?
- I need to see your driver's license,
please.
[Cab driver] Yes sir.
- Excuse me, is there a problem, officer?
[Laughter]
[Toula oinks]
[Ari oinks]

Have you ever seen chairs this color?
- Carpet used to be this color.
[Laughter]

[Ari oinks]
[laughter]
- Ooh!
[Mimicking] Ooh!
[Laughter]
- They had no right
to look in a girl's handbag.
It's private.
[Laughs]
[door opens]
You're Greek, aren't you?
Uh-oh.
[Door opens and shuts]
- You realize the possession of drugs
is a serious offense.
Take it you're Toula.
Hey Chris, isn't that your wife's name?
[Laughs]
- We got the right to talk to a lawyer.
- Shut your mouth.
- The hash is mine.
He doesn't know anything about it.
- You hear that?
Your girlfriend wants to take the rap.

We're family, sugar.
- Don't "sugar" me, cunt.
Give a fuck what you are.
Stand up.
Stand up.
You working tonight, Toula?
- I'm not a prostitute.
- Where'd you get the money for the hash?
- I won it in a card game.
- You can't keep us here.
[Cocks gun]
- [police officer] How'd you like me
to stick a knife in your hand, cunt,
and tell the coroner you pulled it on me?
[Breathing heavily]
- Move to the center of the room.
Do it now!
Remove your clothes.
Now!
Your underwear.
I said your underwear.
- You better help her along.
Seeing she knows you.
[Grunts]
Come on, cunt, come on.
That's right, shit stick.
Relax.
You're going to enjoy this.
[Chris]
Remove the rest of your underwear.

[Toula groans]
[yells]
You fucking whore.
Piece of shit.
[Blows landing]

Putana, putana!
You're a fucking whore.
Look at you.
[Toula whimpering]
- You're a disgrace.
[Blows landing]
[officer yelling in Greek]
Piece of shit.
You're scum.
[Screaming in Greek]
Putana!
Whore, whore!
You fucking whore!
[Sirens]
- Should have kept quiet, Johnny.
For once in your fucking life,
you should have just kept your mouth shut.
- Haven't we always said
what we hate about the wogs
is that they're gutless?
- What are you doing?
- Get down.
Every time you keep your mouth shut,
every time you keep quiet,
that's where you'll stay.
- My truth is my own.
- You have to stand up against all the shit
and all the hypocrisy.
It's the only way to make a difference.
- Get away from me.
I'm coming home with you.
- Toula can look after herself.
- I want to come.
What could I do?
- Drive.
[Ari] What could I do?
[Dramatic music]
[muffled laughter and conversation]
[muffled man's voice] Putana!
Putana!
Putana!
[Upbeat dance music]
[upbeat dance music]
[breathing heavily]
[muffled upbeat dance music]
[inhales deeply]
[sudden loud vibration]
[exhales]
[breathing heavily]
[vibration fades]
[muffled dance music resumes]
[breathes heavily]
- Not here, Ari.
- Do me now.
Do it now.
- Come with me.
[Muffled dance music]
[distant sirens]
[both breathing heavily]
[belt hits floor]
[both breathing heavily]
I think I'm falling in love with you, Ari.
[Breathing heavily]
[breathing quickens]
[Sean gagging]
[gagging]
Ari, fuck!
[Punch lands]
[Sean cries out]
[both panting]
- [Sean] Fuck, you fucking freak.
Come on, you fucker.
Think you're tough?
You think you're tough?
You look at me.
Look at me!
[Panting]
Fucking piece of shit.
Get out.
[Door slams]
[panting]
[softly] I'm sorry.
[Breath shaking]
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
[Crying] I'm sorry.
[Crying]
[muffled upbeat music]
[Ari voice-over]
I'm a whore, a dog, and a cunt.
My father's insults make me strong.
I accept them all.
I'm sliding toward the sewer.
I'm not struggling.
I can smell the shit.
But I'm still breathing.
I'm gonna live my life.
I'm not gonna make a difference.
I'm not gonna change a thing.
No one's gonna remember me when I'm dead.
[Serious music]
I'm a sailor...
and a whore.
And I will be until the end of the world.
