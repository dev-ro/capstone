Yes, bad luck...

Most dangerous portion is over, right?

-Yes.
Having trouble?
I do not know. You will need money.
You know Malcolm.

Y does not want you to know.
And what does that mean?
Well, do not resort to
people forever.
And who else?
To us, I guess.
A Jack and me. And again, Harlan,

Good boy.
I called Malcolm to give me the details?
Surely.
Your Sanseviera need nitrogen.
This is a little weird.
Sure everything is okay?
Si. Lucy?
We download?
Yeah, I guess so.
I have a class.
Okay.
Study hard.
Malcolm
told us to stay a couple of nights. Okay?
Si. It was his idea or yours?
Hello.
This smells like skunk.
Yes, it's the smell of money, kid.
The sweet smell of success.
The guy says we buy
every last leaf.
What's so great?
I said that is great, only that the purchase
.
Not called here, no?
And if you answer Lucy?
Ask for me.
But what if...
is involved in the murder?
And if it is Lucy?
Friends, I've been thinking.
Everyone knows that work there, no?
If you find Malcolm, the
police will kill him.
When we sold,
'd better split up
I have a number.
A phone number.
Malcolm gave it to me if we had any problems
.
Why did not you say so?
Because I forgot, Jack.
I gave it some time.
Hard head.
Campesino.
Residence Stockman
Hi, Ms. Stockman.?
If. Who is this?
I think it's his wife.
Hello Ms. Stockman,

I think it's his mother.

Malcolm gave me this number
in case of problems.
-Problems?
We know that she did not kill him.
You're sure?
Yes, she does not know!

.
That made millions.
Oh yeah?
Ago-a lot of it.

mansions are crooks and all,
Why are dedicated to the drug? Who knows

Well, it was someone
calling on his part.
Want to finalize details for sale.
Malcolm is out of the country.
-Hawai?
-Yes.
Ok guys,
what's going on?
'I said it.
They told me shit.
I have eyes.
What is the real story?
Whenever you get paranoid when
no grass in the house, you know.
What is happening?
Lucy, we'll tell the truth.
Malcolm is in trouble.
Has serious problems.
Pledged over the account.
He left the country and needs money
And why did not you say so?
Because he's scared.
Now can not talk to anyone.
's The truth.
I do not like anything.
'Nobody likes.
-How Is the result?
They're still crushing them.
Want to do this?
Sure.
I invite.
Take off your shirt.
Will be easier.
This is how I always do.
We are lunatics, no?
If, say so.

-What?
What do you do this?
Why do you do it?
For money.
Yeah, I guess.
But if you do this for years
then do not want to stop?
Why stop?
I do not know.
I just...
I think you're amazing.
I guess you'll have some kind of...
dream or something that really
you like to do.
God, you're so young.
Not I am.
-What  Old are you, 15?
-20.
Jesus Christ!
-Why You mock me?

Si. Correct.
And why I come with shit

Is somewhat complicated.
Is not complicated.
Well, not complicated but...
Not at all complicated.
's Just...
Malcolm is in trouble.
Nothing serious. You know,
liquidity problems.
And we keep it secret,
you know, you'd do the same no?
Si.
To me what bothers me,
is that it has become paranoid.
At the end of the day, which we
face us, not him.
The business we chose.
Yes, it is.
'This business was not.
-Do Not.
Nor  grass was.
It's good shit.

Something must have happened.
Shit! Come on.

Nothing is better than a shell.
Well, how much we earn?

Not kidding me...
And probably still there.
What, the harvest?
-Yes.
Harlan, you're amazing.

Maybe is still the harvest!
Maybe there is still grass!
Hello! Hello!

It shows what you know, Carter.
They have not touched even a leaf.
How strange friend.
I do not get it.
Good. Great.
's All about.
Ready to take him.
I think we should let
alive.
If they killed him not to harvest
,
no one will bother us if they think he's still alive, right?
Yes, but for how long?
Lucy will suspect.
She already suspected.
And Danny too.
I do not know.
In his office keeps lists of your clients.
We have money. Malcolm
and has been out before.
Never at harvest time.
And what will happen to his mother and his fucking brother

Sex is... complicated too.
Come on Ben, you fucking asshole,

That I do.
Same as the joint, right?
Growth is growth.
Plants are plants.
Wheat  white?
Si. Look, now you have to treat
to make it white.
Which is fine, but it will take away all the nutrients
.
You can get a
crosses of wheat grain,
already a white spike.
If used to make flour
cake or whatever,
still retain the whole grain.
I think it would be profitable.
And your picture would be on all packages
flour.
Course.
Carter, that would be great.
And what will you do with your money?
You'll spend it on hookers?
Buy a Harley and seek coreanas.' whores
Move, Ben!

-What Are you talking about?
-Uds. know what I mean.

Equal -Parts.
Today at the 23rd
holding the harvest festival,
ask loud applause from
Welcome to Sierra Kahan,
our fearless leader and sister of drugs.
Sierra upload here.
Hi, very good, very good.
As everyone knows,
I came to live here when I was 10
with my mother and my father.
Mom and Dad, come here.
I have my own family now.
The terrible Taylor, the twins
Shine and Blue, Bailey,
and for those who do not know,
'm expecting again!
In our first year here,
had very few farmers.
Y
engaged in all sorts of deliveries.
But they knew one thing.
They believed in something.
Felt they had a mission and a purpose
.
Had a clear idea of how
should behave with others.
And I think today here
still have that.
Now, let's get to fly!
I say something?
I know I am out here but
you think your friends just go party
,
Stay here and you nailed?
Expect you shoot.
Yeah, sure.
And when picking harvest
will stay with all the money.
Do not you think?
They are older, right?
How are older,
try to take advantage.
Basta. Shut Up.
Hey, it's a free country.
I can keep talking, if I want.
If?
Okay, but is not a free planting
so shut your mouth!
Or I'll blow your head!
Understand, 'free country'?
'Free country'...
Hello Jack.
Hello, Sierra. How are you?
Good.
-How Is Malcolm?
He's fine.
I'm surprised not to see him here tonight.
Never lose it.
Yeah, well, you must be very busy right now
.
Yes, I know. We all are.
If we're at.
We have a little worried.
If? Why?
Because it has made deals with
very heavy people.
If?
Very heavy.
You know that if...
begin to compromise with evil people,
you will end badly.
Even in a place like this.
But you know what?
Maybe Malcolm already learned the lesson.
What do you mean?
I do not know.
Listen, when you see Malcolm,
tell him to call me.
-Enseguida.
-All Right.
Sierra.
Well, I stay here.
'll Be back to see you?
-You Sure.
Jack Carter and operations dominate too

Maybe I should get rid of them

It would cost me lose Carter. Look after planting

And Jack,
thought it had potential control
But I'm afraid you missed the thrust
.
No one would miss him.
-What The fuck is wrong ?.
Maybe
away on their own
-Suceden Strangest things.
-Pasaste Good night?
Not bad a little celebration
no?
Sierra Kahan knows something.
What? What can you tell?
Said something like, Malcolm
learned his lesson.
The murder
will be a thing of it?
No sense. It is against violence
more than anyone.
I do not know.
Left me a weird feeling, you know?
Dude, you want to see a whole
large collection of shoes?
Hey! Fuck! Fuck!
-What?
They're here!
-Who Is It?
Come on.
Come for the back way.
Do you mean?
Who is here?
It's the police. An ambush!
'The police? What?
Those who helped us fled!
I do not understand this shit,
if you already paid them!
'I paid them!
Maybe it was not enough.
If it was not, why he invited me
the sheriff to the carousel of his nephew?
Shit! They are the...
're screwed.
Damn! We pay.
Already paid them.
Come on!
-Fast!
-let Me see. Let me see.
God!
They must think we already went.
-wait A minute.
Wait a minute.
What to expect?
Harlan Calm down.
Going very fast.
These are not cops.
They're collectors.
-Gatherers? How do you know?
Because they carry athletic shoes.
What we do?
Shit!
Wait, folks.
They also have guns, you know?
Let him take what's left.
We have enough at Lucy.
You have enough on what Lucy.
Carter  What I say is that I will not die
some grass. It's stupid.
Defend what is ours, Harlan.
That's the way.
If you do not want to fight, fine.
You will have nothing.
But if you cross my path,
I will kill myself.
'Do not dare.
That no? Want to see it?
Want to see?
Small cag√≥n !?
Harlan, do not you challenge another
to kill you.
Ben, damn! Up there!
Is a spy, friend!

Sorry.
I can not stop the bleeding.
We have to do something.

We have to do something!
-Shut Up!
There is only one thing we can do
.
'A moose?

Yes, a moose.
But we failed the shot.

You must sign.

You know, you and I alone.
Hello? Jack!
Hello?
Malcolm?

Constance behind the building.
Solo.
Hello?
Then?
All is well.
So... are you sure
do this?
As his voice sounded on the phone,
worst thing we could do would be to ignore
.
You know you're acting just like Malcolm?
And what's wrong?
Nothing, but puts the willies.
If I doing his part well,
should be grateful.
But Malcolm cost him his life.
Remember that?
I think we should stop and think better
.
I've already thought.
It's what I do.
Do not have to come, I'll go alone.
Do you mean?
I mean you stay in
the alley and wait for me.
But you should not have a
escape plan or something?

What will they do?
-What Is the problem?
-What We do to you, Malcolm?
I came to negotiate with you.
You've got any ideas?
And if I crush
fucking brains out with a hammer?
Do you think?
And if you short the balls to

Already tested. She loves.
What crazy, Malcolm.
One moment, it seems
I do not think.
Not think it will do.
'Of course I believe you.

What they want is the harvest, Carter.
Yes, but surely kill someone.

Hey, someone has to.
That concentration is needed.
Something that you.

Do not talk like that.
-What If... -What?
Jack, what if one of us
goes with you.
A buyer, a seller.
You. I know.
We know, Jack, but...
But what? You want to do something fucking stupid
and fuck the deal?
That's what you want?
's What I'm talking about.
I'm sorry, but I must insist
.
-insisting?
-Yes! Not to accompany you.
Just to watch, buddy.
I mean...

You friends, are the most fucked up
entire history of drug trafficking.
And that gives enormous prestige,

Jack, no. Do Not!
You will not go alone, man. Okay?

must stay calm.
-'Jack Has raz√≥n'? Since when

I do not agree with anyone.
'This is taking too long.
'I think the same.
How do you know how long it takes?
Danny has to check the crop, right?
Calm down.

Several days?
Spend a deer.
Just touch a branch.
And the dog can smell
a week later. Amazing.
To be honest,
do not know much about dogs.
Incredible Creatures.
Anyway
I can also smell things, you know?
Can smell when something weird.
Nothing here rare.
Would have been better if I'd
told the truth from the beginning.
Well, I would have preferred.
I do not know, it's a matter of style.
You talk about Malcolm.
Damn, I mean everything!
Come on. I count it.
Sorry.
Not take any more of this.
No, Carter.
Just one quick glance.
I said no.
If you're not going to shoot, right?
-Pru√©bame.
What, now you're with Jack?
'Please... You're with Jack.
Yes, now I understand.
What I do not understand people who fall
is good to all.
And we would like to take out of the deal
something positive.
All?
Community. Sierra Kahan,
collectors.
I mean, we all try
maintain peace here, you know?
Keep out of the bastards.
Are amateurs.
But  good suspects.
We even buried Malcolm.
Wait a minute.

Everyone knew?
Everyone always know.
Everyone knows everything.
When will you learn?
Bet you and Jack
planned everything.
And I used my,
used to Carter.
If disparar√≠as me, no?
Yeah, you know I love you.
-What?
I do not understand.
You're with Jack, you're with Carter.
Something does not yet know here?
That's what happens?
Ok, fine.
Know Danny, when I told him,
I thought was 2 and a half million.
What happened?
Accounts well.
Les fall well at all but
fuck us in the deal, is it?
If it was Malcolm,
I would have given 4, even 5
And I promised 3.
I removed half a million for lying about Malcolm
, okay?
They are 2 and a half.
It's all?
Take it or leave it.
Ok.
We had a good conversation.
So you love me?
So... -Please, no.

We are not screwed.
There is a good spot for sale
along the route.
We have the seed,
know how to cultivate it.
And in the next harvest,
we can be as we were.
And being fucked by Danny.
If the police could bring again
here and burn all again.

Was a joke, Harlan.
Oh, yes!
