SHREW'S NEST
All children love
bedtime stories.
I was the exception.
The worstpartof the day
was when my sister came to my room
with her red book ofstories,
open a page atrandom
and start reading.
They were always horror stories,
scary stories aboutevil people
who took advantage of others.
There'd be a huge, powerfulogre
who watched over the humans.
I'd have to pretend to sleep
so Montse would stop reading.
Butwhat scared me most
was that every night,
she'd leave very sad.
I thought maybe she'd realized
Iwas pretending to sleep.
And I felt very guilty.
It took me years to find out
thatwhen she closed the door,
Montse faced her own ogre.
Italso took me years to find out
what the bookwas that
filled my nights with nightmares...
HOLY BIBLE
My sister's nightmare began
the day Mama died.
I neverfound out
exactly why she died.
Whenever I asked Montse, she'd say
Mama died giving birth to me.
And that's all.
So I grew up thinking
I brought my family's sadness
when Iwas born.
Mama wore this cross
the day we were married.
It was Grandma's.
Before that, your great-grandmother's.
It's handed down to the eldest
daughteron herwedding day.
God willed that Mama
had no time to give it to you.
But it's yours anyway.
Tears won't revive her,
but the Almighty will.
Let's pray.
Let's pray hard for her.
The second mystery.
Behold, I am the servant
of the Lord.
Let it be to me
according to yourword.
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongstwomen,
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,
now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.
And the Word became flesh...
and dweltamong us.
Us...
Why us? We're women.
Thanks a lot,
have a nice day.
What's this?
One is forMama.
The other's foryou.
Happy birthday, honey.
You've never given me flowers.
Today's a special day.
You turn 18.
It must be hard having my birthday
and Mama's on the same day.
You feel guilty
when you're happy
and when you're sad.
But it's God's will.
I envy you.
You have photos with her.
You're going?
Yes. I open the store today.
Then here.
Take this.
It's Doña Flora's dress.
Don't let herforget to pay.
Then you have to take the flowers
to the cemetery.
Afterlunch.
Okay.
Every day you're more like Mama.
She'd be very proud of you.
- Oh, good!
- Hello.
I came a little early to see you,
congratulate you,
and pull your ears.
Thanks, Doña Puri,
but there's no need.
Here, to go to the movies
with yourfriends.
Doña Puri, it's not necessary!
It is, because I want to.
End of story.
Thank you.
- I'm off.
- Get a move on.
I don't want to be responsible
forthat witch Flora scolding you.
Doesn't it scare you?
What?
That she's a woman now.
She isn't to me.
You have a great talent.
You should open your own boutique.
It's my dream, madam, but...
I've got no money.
And besides, you know...
Right.
The money's not a problem,
I can be your guarantor.
And you wouldn't
have to leave home.
This is a large flat.
You could set it up here.
Yes, but...
I don't know, I'll think about it.
You always say that,
and I think you've already decided.
You won't do it
because you're a scaredy-cat.
- You can take it off now.
- Wonderful.
Lovely.
Do you need me to pay for
the dress now, oran advance?
Don't worry, we're fine.
The girl got paid the other day.
If you need it, ask.
We trust each other.
And your attacks?
How are you handling them?
Fine. I haven't had one in a while.
I suppose this helps.
Yes, it helps a lot.
Since you brought it,
I've been fine.
Are you following my instructions?
Yes, madam.
Two drops in half a glass of water,
never on an empty stomach,
and always just before bedtime
or a nap.
That's it, very good.
Thank you.
Listen, Montse...
You know my husband can help you
with more than this.
He can treat you.
You could try it.
I don't know.
You'll rot here, Montse.
And the girl won't always be here.
She'll meet a boy,
if she hasn't already.
She's fartoo young.
It'll happen, Montse.
She'll want to marry,
start her own family.
Then what'll become of you.
Alright...
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Well, I'm going.
When will you have the dress?
Come in three days.
Very well.
Will you think about the treatment?
Hello!
Are you alright?
I've got a slight headache.
How was it with Doña Puri?
Good.
Your lunch is in the kitchen.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Honey? Is that you?
I see you didn't go to
the cemetery again this year.
You make me ashamed of you.
Girl!
Hello!
Montse?
Where have you been?
No, don't turn it on!
Where have you been?
- The cemetery.
- You're lying.
Come here.
Come here!
Who is he?
Who?
Don't act dumb.
He's a friend.
I didn't raise you
to behave like this.
Then how?
He walked me home
so I'd be alright.
On your knees.
Hands.
Pray.
Our Fatherwho art in Heaven.
I confess before Almighty God...
and before you, my brethren,
that I have sinned in thought,
word,
deed and omission...
Go on!
Through my fault,
through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.
I'm doing this foryour own good.
You're completely insane.
Honey...
Men are instinctive,
they only want one thing from us.
It's in theirnature,
they can't help it.
But they can do a lot of harm.
I only want to protect you.
Sure, by hitting me.
I don't know how a man can
harm me more than you.
You're a spoilt, wretched brat!
- Carlos, will you listen to me?
- Jaime, leave me alone.
Carlos! Will you see sense?
Listen to me.
You're drunk,
you can't do this.
You can't, you don't know
what you're saying.
I can't?
You'll see if I can.
Look!
You see?
I want someone like this.
Is that so much to ask?
A bit young foryou, isn't she?
Are you my friend or my mother?
Look, Jaime...
- Leave me alone.
- You're going to do something stupid.
No, I'm not.
I'm taking a trip,
disappearing fora while.
- What's so bad about that?
- Who are you kidding?
You're running away
because you're a coward.
You are.
You'll get yourself in trouble.
You'll ruin your life
and I won't allow it.
Then stop me!
Oh, Jaime.
Come upstairs,
and when you go,
put a blanket on this beauty.
Let's go.
Go on, up you go.
Did you fix it up properly?
Want me to look at it?
No need.
Sorry about last night.
I need you to forgive me.
Thanks, honey.
But some things you can't fix
by apologizing.
I need some money.
What for?
To buy some things.
- I thought I'd go out and...
- You're not going anywhere.
- But I need...
- You're in mourning.
You're a woman
and you have to look afterthe girl.
Tell me what we need
and I'll get it.
More.
What are you looking at?
Mama!
Mama!
Our Fatherwho art in Heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done
on Earth as it is in Heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those who
trespass againstus.
Lead us notinto temptation,
butdeliver us from eviI.
Amen.
Don't close it, please.
Could you help me?
Ljust fell down the stairs.
Please.
Montse!
Coming.
Why did you put on the chain?
Well...
Because I took a nap.
I slept badly last night.
What's forlunch?
I don't know.
What do you feel like?
You haven't made lunch?
I told you, I fell asleep.
- I guess I have time for a bath.
- Yes, good idea.
Montse!
What?
There's no towel!
I'll bring you one!
Sorry.
I put them in the wash.
Thanks.
Montse...
Can I still wash this?
Yes.
What happened?
I dropped it.
Good.
They're terrible to clean.
- Don't be scared, okay?
- Just open it!
He'll only stay
until he wakes up, then...
Who is he?
I'm not sure.
I think he lives upstairs.
What did you do to him?
What do you mean?
He knocked on the door and...
I only fixed him up.
Every time you go out,
I can't stop you
from doing what you want.
But I can stop you
from coming back in.
So if you've thought of
telling anyone he's here...
I'd think again.
Hello.
Good morning.
How are you?
I fell down the stairs, huh?
Yes, you hit your head,
and you have a broken leg.
How long have I been here?
One day.
A doctor came. He said
you shouldn't move from bed.
I had to make sure
you wouldn't move it.
He helped me immobilize it.
And this doctor...
did he take my name?
No.
Sure, you don't know it.
My name's Carlos.
And you?
Montse.
You've been very nice to me.
Thanks.
Yoursuitcase is here.
It opened up when you fell,
but I think I got everything.
Thanks.
Well...
We'd better get organized.
- What?
- You have to help me upstairs.
But I can't do that.
It's okay, I'll call a friend.
Do you have a phone?
No.
I'm sorry.
Why don't I get you some lunch
and we'll discuss it later?
That sounds good.
Do you have anyone
to look afteryou?
What?
Upstairs, in your place.
A mother, a wife.
I live by myself,
if that's what you mean.
I mean...
you can stay here
as long as you like.
I'm always at home, so...
I can look afteryou.
You're very kind, Montse.
You can learn a lotaboutpeople
from watching the behavior
of certain animals.
Thatwas the nightl first heard
of the Shrews.
And I recall the strange sensation
they were familiar and recognizable,
Open up, please.
Even though I'd never
heard tellof them.
This padlock makes me angry.
And even more
that you hide OurLord.
- I don't like it.
- Don't say that.
Whereveryou go,
his eyes follow you.
Because that's how it is.
I came to tell you...
Carlos woke up today.
He's alright, except for his leg.
He can't leave yet.
He lives alone,
and has no one to look afterhim.
I've convinced him to stay.
I didn't do it to him, honestly.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
I suppose I thought
thatsince we had a new tenant
the time had come to meethim.
In that place, which Montse
hadn'tleft for years,
itwas impossible to do anything
without her knowing.
Living here forced you do
your things when she was distracted,
to getyour space,
to keep your secrets
outofher reach...
Who's there?
I shouldn't be here.
I know you.
I saw you the other night,
on the stairs.
I put a blanket on you.
- It was you?
- Yes.
I wonderwhat you thought,
seeing me there.
That you were the prettiest thing
I'd seen in a long time.
So you live here.
- My name's...
- Carlos.
My sistertold me.
Yoursister, eh?
She didn't tell me you existed.
Really?
Did she hurt you?
Why do you say that?
On the contrary.
Are you okay?
Yes.
I saw the light
and heard you talking.
I thought yourleg
might be hurting.
It hurts.
I must've been talking in my sleep.
I'm sorry I woke you.
Don't worry,
I go back to sleep easily.
See you tomorrow.
See you tomorrow.
I must go.
I thought she was asleep.
If she finds me here, she'll kill me.
You're like a shrew.
What's that?
Like a rat.
Oh, thanks very much!
Well, more like moles.
They like to hide away,
in wait. Like you.
That's not me.
- That's Montse.
- And you.
You don't know me. Or her.
I'm sure she looks normal to you,
but she isn't.
Be very careful.
Will you come tomorrow?
Are you thinking of staying?
If you come, yes.
If I were you, I'd get out fast.
But if you're unfortunate enough
to still be here,
I'll come.
Sorry to botheryou again.
I brought you this.
It'll help with the pain.
What is it?
Let's just say...
it's waterwith a prayer.
Then we're talking about
holy water.
Yes, something like that.
Thanks.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Good morning.
How did you sleep?
Very well.
That waterwas a real miracle.
I knew it'd work.
That's nice.
You didn't tell me
you lived with someone.
What?
- I heard you talking this morning.
- She's my little sister.
I know her.
I think.
Dark hair,
big bright eyes?
Around 20?
- 18.
- That's her, isn't it?
She's very pretty.
And she looks like a good person.
She is.
Why didn't you tell me?
I don't know, really.
Sometimes I do things
that are a little inexplicable.
I suppose to protect her.
- From whom? From me?
- Yes.
Well, more or less.
You saw right through me.
You've got a good eye.
She's a very impressionable girl.
We've had some tough times.
Our motherdied giving birth to her
and she feels so guilty.
I don't know how to
get it out of her head.
Gee, sorry to hearthat.
And yourfather?
I suppose he's dead too.
We haven't seen him for14 years.
- The War?
- Yes.
He left and never came back.
I'm sorry. I really am.
And you?
- What's your story?
- My story?
My story is... there is no story.
My parents died when I was a boy
and when I came of age
I inherited capital and property.
Since then I've lived.
I've lived well.
- That's lucky.
- Yes.
I guess, although,
I don't know, sometimes...
I do inexplicable things too sometimes.
Well, that's it.
Do you feel better?
Yes, much better.
Thanks a lot, Montse.
You're an incredible woman.
Pass me my pants, please.
Look.
I need you...
to go up to my flat.
Go get any of my books,
and we'll read together.
And if you like it, keep it.
Lovely.
Really lovely.
You look very nice.
Of course.
But the credit goes to you
and your gifted hands.
You know what?
My niece is marrying in spring.
This dress would be a fine gift.
So? Have you ever made
a wedding dress?
Montse.
Montse!
Sorry. Did you say a wedding dress?
Yes.
What's wrong? You're miles away.
The other day you said
your husband could help me.
Of course. Of course.
I want to try it, Doña Puri.
I want to go outside.
When my husband gets home
from the surgery
I'll tell him you'll call.
- I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you.
Hello, doctor. I'm Montse.
Hello. Iwas expecting your call.
Doña Puri told you?
Yes, butl want to hear it from you.
I want to do it, doctor.
I need to try it.
Good, Montse.
I'm glad.
Thank you.
What do I have to do?
For now, we'll try an exercise.
Open your front door and try
to touch the wall in front.
It's a hard exercise foryou,
so it's important to stay calm.
Don't do it all at once.
Today just take one step
and stay outside as long as you can.
- Willyou call me to say how itwent?
- Of course.
- I hope you make it.
- I wish.
I spoke to Doña Puri's husband today.
The doctor? About Carlos?
No, about me.
What's wrong?
I've decided
to try to leave the house.
But really try.
I'm doing exercises.
What exercises?
- Going out.
- Come on!
Just one step.
I got all the way outside.
Really?
How did it feel?
I wanted to die.
But...
I'll keep trying, really.
I'm fine.
I can't rememberthe last time
I felt this good.
I'm so happy, Montse.
So what got into you?
Why now?
Carlos.
He asked me to get some books.
Are those his house keys?
Easy, isn't it?
Just climb the stairs, go in,
a few yards, right above.
But for me
it's like touching the sky.
An impossible distance to travel.
I'm that far away from
the world and real life.
That's how bad I am.
I've turned this house
into a giant coffin
from which I can't escape.
And with Carlos, it's like...
a tiny bit of real life
has come inside and...
I feel I have to
make the most of it.
That's why.
You like Carlos.
With Carlos I feel like
a normal woman.
God gave me
a very difficult life, but...
He brought you into this world
to give me strength,
and now He's sent Carlos
to finish what you started.
Will you help me?
Thank you.
You look like a clown.
You're doing this forhim?
What do you want to do, scare him?
I like you without makeup.
Like Mama.
She never put on makeup
because she didn't need to.
You're still here.
You look lovely.
Did you put on that dress for me?
Come here. Come sit with me.
Speak quietly, please.
Don't be scared.
You can't live like that.
Don't be afraid of anyone,
not even Montse.
That's easy to say.
Are you alright?
It hurts sometimes.
It goes away if you come.
It doesn't look good, does it?
Montse has it undercontrol.
- The doctor said...
- What doctor?
Montse told me a doctorcame.
No doctorcame to see you.
Why would Montse lie to me?
Because she's like that.
I don't understand why you don't go.
I wanted to see you again.
Carlos, I'm serious.
I can't go.
When I was coming downstairs,
I was leaving.
- On a trip?
- Well,
you could say "on a trip",
you could say "running away".
I didn't intend to fall
down the stairs
orforMontse to hide me here,
but it's perfect.
Don't be scared, not at all.
It's not dangerous,
foryou orMontse.
But I can't tell you any more.
I don't know what
you're running from,
but you have to run from Montse.
Montse's looking after me.
Carlos, when you woke up,
did she let you call anyone
to say you were here?
Montse said you had no phone.
Exactly.
Exactly? What's going on?
We do have a phone.
And she din't tell you I live here.
Don't you realize?
Listen...
What?
I need a favor.
- What?
- I need you to call Montse.
What?
She gives me something in water
to ease the pain.
Call her, please. Call her.
My God! She's giving you morphine.
Morphine? Really?
Don't you see?
She's kidnapped you!
It's alright...
Carlos, Carlos, look at me.
She's in love with you,
she won't let you leave.
- She'll let you die first...
- Forgive me.
Forgive me, Elisa. Forgive me.
- What's that?
- Forgive me, Elisa.
- Carlos, what are you saying?
- Forgive me.
- Carlos, I'm begging you.
- Forgive me.
Forgive me! Forgive me, Elisa.
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
- Carlos!
- Forgive...
Carlos, it's Montse. It's Montse!
It's Montse!
No! What do I do? What?!
Forgive me. I'll stay, I'll stay.
Forgive me. Forgive me.
- Dad, he must be here.
- Do you really think so?
I tell you, he's not here.
He's not even in Spain.
Hello, Doña Puri.
Montsei How nice to hearfrom you.
How are the exercises?
Are you doing them?
Yes, I am,
but I'm getting more attacks now.
- I get terrible migraines.
- Isuppose that's normal.
But I can't stand it,
they're just so severe.
I need a dose.
Ah, the dose, of course.
I'll bring itnext time.
I mean I need more
than you usually bring.
Even more, Montse?
You know what both
I and my husband
are riskingevery time
I bring that little flask?
I can make it up to you.
Rememberthat wedding dress
foryour niece?
I'll make it forfree.
It'll be my first.
You disappoint me, Montse,
it's a pity.
But alright, if that's what youwant,
I'll make you happy.
Thank you, thank you, madam.
- When shall I come?
- Wheneveryou wish.
And I'll take you up on thatdress.
I'll bring her to getfitted.
Yes, of course.
Good idea. Thank you.
Goodbye, Montse.
Good morning.
Excuse me, we're investigating
the disappearance of Carlos Cuenca,
yourupstairs neighbor.
Do you know him?
No.
Have you heard any noise
orseen anything odd lately?
No.
May we come in?
- Shall we go into the living room?
- No need, thank you.
So you don't know your neighbor?
That's right.
- How long have you lived here?
- Since I was born.
Yourneighbor's lived here
quite some time.
Are you sure you've never seen him?
I have an illness that stops me
from going outside.
I don't know anyone except
the permanents.
- Do you live alone?
- With my sister.
- Does she nevergo out either?
- Yes. She goes out.
- May we speak to her?
- She's at work.
Let's go.
Very well.
Ask your sister if she knows anything.
If so,
tell herto call us at the station.
Thank you.
- Good day.
- Good day.
Can I speak to you fora moment?
I don't know where to start.
You see,
there are lots of things
you don't know about me.
Bad things.
But I don't mind you knowing.
Since I've known you,
I haven't been scared,
I've forgotten to be.
No man has treated me like you,
with respect and warmth.
The truth is, I don't know
how to do these things.
I suppose
you simply try to say
what you feel.
I like you and I want...
well...
I'd like to know if
you feel the same for me.
You're making it hard for me.
Look at me. What do I have to do
foryou to call a doctor?
A doctoralready came.
You're lying.
Do you want me to die, Montse?
No, for God's sake!
Then do you want me
to be a cripple?
Sick, like you?
No. I only...
What's wrong?
What's wrong is that if I leave
this house, it'll be minus a leg.
But I'd like to leave it alive.
Why not drink the holy water?
That's what you need.
I need to go to a hospital,
not to be drugged with morphine.
How do you know?
I've come to know you well, Montse.
Because you're
the same as me, a liar,
incapable of telling the truth
to the people you love.
Do you do the same to yoursister?
You say you love her,
but you're lying.
You abuse her,
lock herin your bubble.
That's how you love.
Is that how you love?
Look at me!
"The truth will set you free. "
Didn't the Son of God say that?
Start by doing that.
Start by telling the truth,
and maybe that way
someone will love you one day.
Who are you?
The downstairs neighbor.
- How'd you get in?
- I have Carlos' keys.
Have you news of Carlos?
He's at my place.
Are you his girlfriend?
I ought to be his wife.
We were to be married
the day he vanished.
- Come on.
- No, no. I can't go.
My sisterwould kill me
if I went down with you.
The key.
But...
Wait.
What are you going to do?
Good work, my dear.
You're worthless.
Not even loved by a cripple.
Don't you see, little one?
I'm not your little one.
I'm not yours.
Of course you're mine.
You can't get away from me.
Yes I can.
Oh, yes? How?
By committing suicide?
Carlos is right.
"The truth will set you free. "
- It's the word of God.
- And what does that mean?
Will you tell the whole truth
to the "girl"?
- You know you won't.
- We'll see.
No, you're a coward.
You always have been.
Your mouth's always full of things
you're going to do, but don't.
Leave me alone!
Where's Carlos?
Excuse me?
Get out of my house!
I'd be delighted... with my husband.
Carlos!
No! No, no, don't do it!
Don't do it, please!
Try stopping me.
- Don't do it.
- Carlos!
Carlos!
Carlos, don't hide,
we're going home.
Carlos!
Carlos?
Carlos, the party's over. Let's go!
Carlos?
Elisa...
Carl...
Elisa...
- Elisa, get me out of here.
- What have they done to you?
Get me...
No!
Murderer! Murderer!
- Crazy woman! No!
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Crazy! Crazy!
- Shut up!
Shut up!
I need to think.
That's the Montse I know.
Now what?
Shut up.
Are you going
to tell "the girl" this too?
Apparently not.
I love these moments of yours
before the storm.
I neverknow
which way you'lljump.
Forexample,
where will you hide the girl?
There are no more empty spaces.
We'll see.
Please, no! Please!
You are invited to the wedding
of Carlos and Elisa.
Elisa?
Elisa?
Elisa?
Elisa?
Elisa?
Montse.
Where have you been?
The store. It was stocktaking day.
Can we talk?
They were lovely, weren't they?
Radiant.
- How was yourday?
- Hectic.
Things happened
that make you think.
You're 18 now and...
although you'll always be
my "girl",
I have to accept reality:
You're not anymore.
And I understand...
the feeling of not wanting
to take any more.
Montse, I...
Listen...
This is going to be hard forme.
Ljust ask you to listen,
then say what you have to say.
- What do you remember of Papa?
- Very little.
He was tall and strong.
With rough hands and face.
Sad.
He wasn't always.
But Mama's death changed everything.
It changed Papa,
he was sick with love.
Maybe saying it
sounds poetic and romantic,
but it's not.
Being sick with love is
the most terrible thing there is.
You always say you envy me
because I knew Mama,
because I have portraits with her.
And I understand.
But I envy you too, because...
you didn't see what Papa became.
He stopped working,
speaking, eating...
He shut himself inside the home
and inside himself.
He could only think of Mama.
He tried to remember her
in every detaiI,
in every thing,
in every person,
especially in his eldest daughter,
who with every day
was more like his wife.
I suppose that...
in his madness,
his love...
for his daughter blended
with his love for his wife
and he confused me with her.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
He abused me foryears, every night.
I'd go into your room
to read from the Bible,
remember?
Ljust wanted you to go to sleep fast
so you wouldn't hear
what happened in my room.
That's all I wanted.
It...
wasn't the real him. No!
Why take so long to tell me?
Because telling you this...
means telling you
what came next.
Papa didn't desert us.
One night, when I was going to
read to you from the Bible,
I found Papa with you
in your room.
He was so far gone that...
a terrible idea came to me.
What if he'd set his mind
on you too?
You get prettier every day.
You're the only beautiful thing
in this house.
Dinner's ready.
I was so fullof rage right then.
It came to me in a flash.
What's wrong? Aren't you eating?
No wonder, this tastes like shit.
Why are you two
gawping like idiots?
What are you hiding there?
Nothing.
What are you hiding there?
TERROR OF THE RATS
Let me go!
Let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!
I took him to bed and laid him out.
I took care of him
as ifhe weren't dead.
Shortly after, the War broke out,
which helped me justify
his disappearance.
I kept him here forweeks.
When his body began to rot,
I decided to hide him.
Do you realize
what you've done to me?
I know, but I want that to change.
Please.
Where'd you put him?
Where'd you hide him?
Honey...
- I understand you're angry, but...
- But what?
My whole life
is a lie invented by you.
I can't stay here.
And where will you go?
You can't do anything!
I can go to the police
and tell them about Papa.
I'm sure they'll find him.
Oh, thank God!
- Where is she?
- Elisa?
I don't know what she did with her.
The flat looks like nothing happened.
She was pregnant.
Elisa was expecting a child of mine.
That's why I was running,
they were making me marry her.
- It really hurts, doesn't it?
- A lot.
No! No!
No!
- No! No!
- Carlos! Carlos!
Please, Carlos. Listen to me.
Look at me, Carlos.
She won't beat us.
You see what you made me do.
You were very naughty, Carlos.
It was very disappointing.
And don't think it was
a pleasure for me.
I have a visitor.
One word and I'll sew
your mouth shut next!
Do you have any ideas
foryourwedding dress?
Well...
I don't know, I trust you
because I love the dresses
you made formy aunt.
Montse's very talented,
you should trust herjudgment.
Thank you.
I'll make suggestions, but...
- first I need some measurements.
- Alright.
I'm so grateful, Montse.
Thank you. But you know
it was in exchange forsomething.
I brought it,
but I don't have it here.
I ran into "the girl" on the stairs
and gave it to her.
"The girl"? Why?
I don't want you to
weaken in your recovery.
- This dress is beautiful.
- Thank you, dear.
Are you doing my husband's exercises?
Yes, but I've neglected them a bit.
See? That's what I mean.
Montse, that liquid is very tempting.
The girl will know
how to administer it.
You shouldn't have given it to her.
- What was that?
- Something must've fallen.
- Help!
- Who's there?
- Excuse me a moment.
- Get me out of here!
Help! Help!
You don't make it easy for me!
Let's get out of here right now!
What have you done, Montse?
What have you done?
Nothing, just defending my home.
You don't understand.
But... how can I understand this?
What are you going to do?
The same thing, defend my home.
No, listen, I can talk to my husband.
There's time to cure you,
if that's what you really want.
And he's got lots offriends
in the police.
We can make this disappear.
I'm sorry, Doña Puri. It's too late.
There's no salvation for me now.
The morphine! Montse!
How will you get morphine
if you do this to me?
God will provide.
I was waiting foryou.
I need what Doña Puri gave you.
My God!
Give me what Doña Puri gave you.
What did you do to Carlos?
Get me out of here.
Get me out, please.
- Give it to me!
- Look out! No! No!
- Give it to me!
- Montse, no.
- Alright, alright.
- Leave heralone!
Here they are.
Hold it!
Give it to me, please.
What have you done?
There's still another.
If you want it whole,
don't move a muscle.
If you drop it,
I swear I'll go in and kill him.
Why are you covered in blood?
Doña Puri discovered Carlos.
And his wife.
They're in the sewing room.
Carlos' fiancÃ©e was pregnant.
You didn't know, did you?
That's you.
You've killed three innocent women
and a baby.
And Papa too.
What's stopping you from killing me?
But do you know what?
That certainty doesn't
scare me anymore.
On the contrary,
it gives me strength.
What have you done?
The same thing you do to people.
Who do you think God will forgive?
You...
or me?
Now we're even.
We're leaving.
Come on, Carlos, help me, please.
Pull there.
Yes, that's it.
Good.
- Can you take the weight?
- Yes.
Go on then.
Let's go.
See that?
Look what you've turned herinto.
Come on.
- I can't.
- Like that.
- I can't.
- Carlos, no.
Carlos, come on.
She doesn't look like my daughter.
Though, in the end,
I didn't raise her.
Alright, we'll do it anotherway.
Sit up.
Like this.
Carlos, come on.
Carlos, please, help me.
Now she's fleeing with your boyfriend.
I hope you do something.
Leave me alone! Leave me alone!
Like that.
Come on, honey, she's getting away.
No!
Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.
I didn't want this, Montse.
What?
Papa took a photo
when you were born.
What?
A photo with Mama.
You're lying.
That's impossible.
I hid it with Papa.
Do you want to know where?
I couldn't tell you.
I was ashamed.
Go to sleep,
my baby,
outside the moon is bright.
She protects her mantle,
I protectmy cradle.
Now my baby is asleep,
now her crying is hushed.
The seamstress stars
rock her sleep and my song.
Now my baby is asleep,
the mint take its rest.
Spring is here
and the frost is melting.
The other day I realized
I don't know your name.
It's beautiful. Beautiful.
Relax, relax.
We did it.
Shrews are rodents
that burrow long caves underground,
far from other animals.
They have solitary customs
and some have venomous glands
to immobilize larger prey.
