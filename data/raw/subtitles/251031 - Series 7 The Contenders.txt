Do you have any bean-dip?
All we have is what's out.
Hey! What about the body?
Just let them deal with it.
'Previously on The Contenders...'
All I can allow myself
to think about is my baby.
There's nothing that I won't do
for my baby - it's that simple.
'With ten kills in only two
tours, she's been unstoppable.
'Now, one month
before the birth of her child,
'just five lives stand
between her and her freedom.'
I try not to think about it
cos I just have to get through this.
'Dawn Lagardo.
'Mother,
'hero...
'Contender.'
'Everything you are
about to see is real.
'Real people in real danger
in a fight for their lives...
'on The Contenders.
'This week's programme
will be played in the city of Newbury
'in southwest Connecticut,
the nutmeg state.
'Newbury was incorporated in 1702,
'with a population of 65,585,
'and is a total area
of 44 square miles.
'Five Contenders have
been randomly selected.
'Drawings were done under
the observations of accountants.
'Let's meet our new Contenders.'
Is your dad home?
We're Special Operatives
of The Contenders.
- Anthony Reilly?
- Yeah. What's with the lights?
Ma'am, we're Special Operatives
of The Contenders.
We're here to help you.
Mr Franklin? He locked it.
Get the fuck out of here.
Get off my property.
- Lindsay Berns?
- No. No, not my baby.
You can't do this.
- Lindsay Berns?
- Get your father. Go on.
No! Don't answer for me.
Just gimme the gun.
No! Jeff!
'Six strangers, brought
together by the luck of the draw,
'in a game without rules
'where the only prize
is the only prize that counts.
'Your life.'
'It's gonna sound kinda weird,
'but when I looked out
of the window as we were landing
'I felt proud of myself.
'Like this was a town of people
'who thought that I would
never amount to anything.
'And, yet here I am coming back,
'and I felt like I kinda
made something of myself.'
Can you help me down?
'I was thinking what was it
going to be like being here,
'fifteen years after I left?'
I thought at least they'd pick us up.
Maybe they didn't get my message.
We're on our own out here.
Can you give us a ride somewhere?
Call a cab.
Is that a no?
What have they
done to this place?
Everything looks like
it's been dipped in plastic.
Oh, man! See that?
That's were I kicked
Tracey Frankel's ass in high school.
My God!
See that building right there?
That's where the roller rink was.
I lost my virginity there.
Er, could we cut that, actually?
I'm pretty sure
that's where my dad's buried.
You how they say
you can never go home again?
- Is that what they say?
- Yeah. And it's true.
You can't expect 'em
to be happy to see you.
Yeah, why should
it be any different now?
Get that thing away from me.
I mean it!
'Contenders
are monitored 24 hours a day
'for the duration of the programme.
'State-of-the-art transmitters
and global positioning systems
'help us to bring you
the real story as it unfolds.'
Well, the sun came up again.
Close the blinds!
Get away from there.
Use your head! You wanna get killed?
Great
Tony?
Tony?
I'm gonna take the kids down
to my mum's for a bit. OK?
We're going to grandma's for a bit.
I gotta be stealth.
I can get through this.
You can do it, you can do it.
'You are watching
The Contenders - Series Marathon.'
'It's homecoming
for our reigning Contender,
'as her secrets are revealed.
'Can she survive another round
of vicious, deadly opposition?'
Tony's coming.
'And can we take it?'
They're here, let them in!
Please, let them in!
I thought I'd look these people
up, fuck with them a bit
before the whole thing gets stared.
You know, psych them out.
It's ringing.
Tony Reilly?
I'm watching you right now.
Who is this?
I just called to say
I'm gonna fucking annihilate you.
He hung up.
Ma, nothing has happened.
I'm just saying,
if something should go wrong
or I have an accident
you take care of the kids
and... Michelle because...
they deserve a good life
and... I wanna tell you I'm sorry...
for screwing up my life.
I gotta go, Ma.
Me too, goodbye.
'What can I say,
life isn't fair?'
Six months ago, I'm an asbestos
worker till I get laid off.
Now I'm supposed to feed three
kids on an unemployment cheque?
Forget the mortgage, we gotta eat.
'Then my number comes up.
'Forget everything!
I never thought it'd happen to me
'so I never got prepared.
'With my training and discipline
I will get through this.
'Well, I got in a little trouble
when I was a kid
'so I went away for a while.
'I learned about physical training,
'which is good - a strong body
is a strong mind.'
I keep myself in shape,
keep my mind in tune,
I can get through anything.
'I got a comfortable ranch here,
two bedroom, two bath.
'Probably get 195 on the market.
'Got a nice pool.
We did it ourselves, Michelle and me.
'Got three beautiful kids.'
We had a rough time... But we're
together again now, as a family.
Come here you, I got you!
Your mother's getting
worried for nothing.
- Come on! That's enough.
- They're fine!
Put their heads together.
Two heads are better than one!
Hell on wheels, that's what they
are. They're good boys, though.
Through my mistakes, I'll teach them
the right way to do things,
I don't want 'em to be me.
I want them to be their own men
and they're gonna be.
'And Mom'll help with that.'
That's enough now.
'Michelle, she should be up
for sainthood, to put up with me.
'I've had a few problems
over the years.
'But she's a doll about it,
you know?'
She's my partner, you know, in life.
I'm only doing this for her
and the kids, not for me.
'If you think that I'm gonna
give all this up, forget it.'
Just watch your back,
cos Tony's coming.
OK, I got a...
9mm, semi-automatic handgun,
a.223 semi-aumatic...
semi-automatic...
- Semi-automatic...
- Rifle.
Rifle.
And a 12-gauge, pump shotgun.
My dad got me
a hand-to-hand combat knife.
'We suggest Contenders
have a month's supply of food
'and at least one rifle
and one handgun each.
'Though not required,
a bulletproof vest is wise.'
My boyfriend, Nathan, paid for
half of this bulletproof vest.
It's supposed to be,
like, top-of-the-line.
And I think that that
was very thoughtful of him.
And I think it shows
how much he cares about me.
Connie, hi,
it's Dawn from the show.
Are you still there?
I just thought I'd tell you
there's a bomb in your house
and it's gonna blow in about
five, four, three, two, one.
Shit!
I'm gonna get you, Connie.
Fuckin' gun.
Can we go?
Well, I'm a nurse in the ER.
So I'm no stranger to crisis
and believe me,
we get all kinds in there.
Two gunshot wounds,
a chest wound.
We got cells on the right side.
'Everyone asks me
if the ER is like it is on TV.
'And I say it's just like TV,
'only it never ends.
'And it's more bloody - I don't
think they can show that.'
We got no information on this guy.
- Picked him up on the street.
- It's OK.
Some of these cases
are human garbage.
But if they show signs of life,
you have an obligation
to bring 'em back.
'I've learned to have
a lot of empathy...
'rather than sympathy.
'Sympathy can send you
down the tubes real fast.'
You have to detach yourself
from anything that's ugly,
or you can't deal with it.
'I'm not an aggressive person
by nature.
'I'm not out to hurt anybody.
'I'm basically the kind of
person who wants to help people,
'not hurt them.'
I may have helped people to die
who were suffering.
That happens more often
than you think,
but no, I have never killed anyone.
'Well, we all know this can
happen to any one of us.
'We all have to prepare
in our own way.
'I believe what they say,
'that God never gives us
more than we can handle.'
I suppose this
is happening to me for a reason.
God knows why.
But...
I'm a survivor.
Nathan... Nathan, no.
Nathan, you know that I can't.
You could be gone tomorrow,
who cares if you're a virgin?
I said no
and no is a complete sentence.
Besides, I don't...
feel very sexy right now.
Fuck all virgins now!
'Contenders leave their
family and friends before the show
'to ensure their safety.
'Goodbyes are difficult
'as they enter into the unknown
world of The Contenders.'
Get off me, you're on drugs.
I'm on drugs?
Well, take the keys and go.
You can go. Pick the keys... Go on.
Tony, I...
I'm not stopping you.
I gotta feed the kids,
I gotta go to my mother's.
- Just move..
- You're making Alexis a mess.
Will you just tell him?
She's still out there.
Why don't you go out and tell
her to come in for a coffee
and blow my head off
and get this show on the road.
I'm not even gonna dignify
that with a response.
This is... very abusive behaviour.
I don't think she has the chops
to kill me anyway.
Do you know this person?
We had some classes together
in high school.
You didn't mention that before.
I just put it together.
It's a long time ago, I mean...
Was she cute then?
She looks overweight on TV.
I think that's because
she's eight months pregnant.
Why are you defending her?
Hello... Hello?
- What did he say?
- No one's home.
- I saw someone in the window!
- No one's answering the phone.
Driver, let's go.
- Where?
- Anywhere, just go.
'Are you looking forward
to meeting Jeff?'
'That's a retarded question.'
- You know this guy?
- Yeah.
- How do you know him?
- I just do. From high school.
I'm not exactly sure
what you're looking for.
What is that you want me to say?
You want me to say something
for your programme? What is it?
I'm really excited to see him
cos I have to kill him.
It really excites me, you know.
I-I always wanted to kill my friend
and now I get the chance to do it.
Look at me.
Tell Dawn whatever you
want to tell her right now.
I can't do this any more, I think.
Jeffrey Norman is a... vital...
33-year-old man...
who is living with testicular cancer.
And he's my husband.
'Firstly, I'm doing this because
Jeff won't talk on camera.
'He's an artist and he believes
in non-violence.
'And I have to respect that.'
It's not that people...
don't understand Jeff's landscapes,
it's just that
they're too confrontational.
He's holding up a mirror and saying,
"This is the truth
about your life."
You know, and... a lot of people
can't handle that.
'Jeff and I met ten years ago
'when he moved back
from New York City.
'We dated for about three months
and got married right away.
'I know a lot of people said
that was too quick,
'but sometimes you just know.'
♪ Life touches us today
♪ Giving us hope and shining ray
♪ Glimpses of the trinity
♪ Glimpses of eternity... ♪
'They say that it's bad luck
'for the groom to see the bride
before the wedding,
'but Jeff picked
out my gown himself.
'He's got an eye
for that kind of thing.'
It all started... with a...
Iittle bump.
About the size of a pea.
And within an hour and a half,
we went from looking into it
to finding out that he had cancer.
'Jeff's testicles were removed
'in a procedure
they call orchidectomy.
'Evidently, it was a stage three
cancer because it didn't work.'
The other day,
he gestured me over to his bed,
and he held me really close
and he whispered in my ear,
"Here I am, I'm not dead.
"But I can't move."
'And I think that's why...
'he won't defend himself.
'It's like he wants to die'
'Is Jeff ready
to face the future...'
Who is this woman?
'..Alone?'
'As the competition mounts,
Dawn confronts her past...'
Please leave.
'..But can't escape the present.'
Get out here and fight like a man.
'Let the games begin.'
'My parents are very
over-protective.'
Have you got your guns?
'They're very concerned about me
'and enthusiastic about anything
that I'm involved in.'
Sometimes that ends up
translating into...
putting a lot of pressure on me.
OK, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna go in there
and blow his head off!
That's right! And who'll
be sitting here waiting for you?
You are.
My dad would want me
to tell the Contenders
that I'm going to win,
and I will win.
- Can I have a kiss goodbye?
- No kisses goodbye.
No one's going anywhere
so there is no reason to say goodbye.
- Kiss for good luck?
- No, this guy's an easy mark.
Just go in there
and you do some damage,.
Are you ready?
Ready.
Go. Go, go, go...
GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO!
'With five opponents to
battle, and a baby due at any moment,
'the clock is ticking for
the longest reigning Contender
'and the life inside her.'
OK, so what's the story?
You're getting very close to
the time when you might labour.
The baby's dropped
into the birth canal.
You're already 3cm dilated,
I wouldn't be surprised
if you were early.
How early? Like, when?
I have no idea,
it could be any day now.
It could be a month,
it's still in the hands of God.
So what you're saying
is you don't know?
Exactly.
If you feel anything
unusual or strange,
if you have any questions, call me.
Any time... day or night. OK?
Can I ask you a personal question?
Sure, what?
Can you sign this for me?
Can you make it out to Shawna
and date it, too?
Thank you.
How do you feel about
seeing your sister again?
Er... I don't know.
What do you think
will happen when you get in?
I'm not sure. Maybe they'll be
happy to see me.
I don't think so, though.
'I always turn into my old self
when I'm around them.
'This time I wanna try to...
not do that.'
Hi, Laura. Remember me?
I know why you're here. There's
nothing we can do, please leave.
- Where's Mom?
- She doesn't wanna see you.
Can we talk inside? It's really
not cool for me to be out here.
Then you should go.
If I were you, I'd go.
Just let me in and then I'll go.
Please, Laura.
Look at me.
Give me a minute.
Say you'll take my baby.
It's not for me, it's for the baby.
You have some nerve,
waltzing in here 15 years later
asking for favours.
I came back
for your first wedding, Laura.
You didn't shave your armpits
for your sister's wedding.
We all remember that.
This is not about my armpits.
Why don't we say
what this is really about?
You still can't forgive me
because I had an abortion.
In high school I had an abortion,
she threw me out.
You're embarrassing your mother
in front of the whole country.
Laura, I really wanted
to bury the hatchet with you,
but you are a total cunt.
Now all I want from you is your car.
Well, you can't have my car.
- OK.
- No! That is my car.
I need the keys.
Just give me the keys, Laura.
You wouldn't dare.
Mom, are you gonna let her do this?
Just give her the keys.
No! Not the SUV. Mother, tell her...
You are an animal.
You always behaved like an animal,
a whore, an addict.
Now you're a murderer
and a thief.
Thanks a lot, bye-bye.
Colby, get back here.
I saw you on TV. I love you.
Bye.
Dawn, wait. Wait a minute!
Wanna talk about it?
No, I don't want to talk about it.
Would you get that thing
out of my face, please?
'With her hopes dashed
and nowhere to turn,
'it's time for Dawn
to take control and get activated.'
'Sometimes you're
just so angry and so confused
'and all you can think to do
is go out and kill somebody.
'Like, that's the only way
you're gonna feel safe again.
'I just gotta do what I gotta do.
'I gotta take care of
what I gotta take care of.'
Hey, Tony!
Come on, get out here
you big piece of pussy.
Tony, please,
give me the baby and let us go.
Don't make me do this.
I won't let you take my kids away.
They're not your kids,
you never adopted them.
- Alexis is my daughter!
- No, she isn't!
What does that mean?
Tony, get out here
and fight like a man!
Shit!
Fucking Pat!
Hey! You wanna move?
- You want me to shoot you?
- What?
Do you want me
to fucking shoot you? Asshole.
God damn it!
'We got a runner.
We have a hostage situation.
'Contender Reilly
abducted his own child at around 4 p.m.
'as he fled from Dawn's attack.
'This guy is in violation
and he's gotta be stopped.
'After 30 minutes
of high-speed pursuit,
'this Contender is not slowing down.
'Operatives will attempt
to stop him by shooting the tyres.
'And it worked! He's literally
running on his wheel rims.
'Sparks are flying everywhere.
'This guy's a danger
to himself as well as others.
'Thank God
he's pulling off the Highway.'
'He's trying to double
back but he won't get far.
'Reilly has turned off
into a dead end.
'Once the car stopped,
Tony's head went down out of view.
'This doesn't look good.
'Our SWAT team doesn't rush him
despite the threat to the baby.
'They'll wait patiently for him
to let off some steam.'
Keep him away. Stay away.
'Reilly has a knife
at his child's throat.'
I wanna get the fuck out of here.
I don't wanna hurt nobody.
'We're hoping he'll calm down
and surrender
'but this desperate man
won't give up his tiny hostage.'
You fuckers.
'The chase may be over,
but the fight has just begun.
'Is freedom within Tony's grasp?
'Will Lindsay make the cut?'
I HATE YOU!
'Has Franklin lost his mind?
'And, will Connie take the plunge?'
I'm not out to hurt anybody.
'Then, what dark secret
do these two share?'
I'm sorry.
'The Contenders, the rules
are as simple as life and death.'
You can't judge somebody's
reaction to being chosen.'
- Give me the baby.
- Don't fuck around now.
'Contenders like this
are the most problematic people
we encounter.
'Thanks to the expert training
of our Special Operatives
'this vicious coward has been
subdued.
'And his hostage has been safely
returned to her mother.'
'Don't fuck around now.'
'It was frustrating
because on the one hand,
'I was like,
"Just do something, get him."
'And on the other, I was like,
"Go, Tony, get out of there."'
'She may have let Tony slip away,
'but Dawn is a formidable adversary.
'And our longest reigning Contender.'
Look, I'm just doing
what anybody else would do...
with a kid on the way.
What did they call me
in the paper, "Bloody Mama"? Christ.
'She's a reluctant hero
'but this young woman
has a natural talent for battle.
'And her stats speak for themselves.'
I think Dawn is a terrible person.
She already has
so much blood on her hands.
I think Dawn's a rag.
She just runs around,
she got lucky a couple of times.
'You see her track record?
Those guys weren't prepared.'
After two weeks of this
I can tell you one thing,
Iearning how to react is critical.
'You cannot do stupid things
when dealing with these people.'
She's unprincipled,
she has no morality... that I can see.
That kid should be stripped
from her loins.
God should come down
and do it himself.
And God should come down
and fuck her mother for having her.
I guess it's like being
in a war mentality.
'It's kill or be killed,
it's not like we have a choice.'
I think Dawn is intimidating
and scary... and pregnant.
She's unkempt.
She has no faith.
I... I...
I think she is a soulless creature.
She's afraid to face the truth -
she's gonna lose.
'I'm scared.'
I'm panicked, I'm flipping out,
but I'm gonna make it.
'We're at the Newbury hospital
'where Contender Tony Reilly
is in critical condition
'after his attempted escape.
'A self-inflicted knife wound
to the back
'has left him paralysed
and vulnerable to attack.'
'I think Tony
is a very troubled individual.
'I think he's having a lot
of trouble living with who he is
'and what his circumstances are.
'I think, really, that what I am
about to do is an act of mercy.'
Oh, Jesus, Connie! No, listen...
Hey! Hey, man,
this ain't a fucking contest.
Jesus! What the fuck's
the matter with you?
I thought this was a contest!
I'm tied down
like some fucking dog!
This is bullshit!
It's a set-up, Connie.
Can't you see that?
Don't do it!
Leave that thing alone!
Put it down and get me out of here!
This ain't even a kill! Look at this!
Connie... please...
I swear to fucking Christ.
What kind of fucking bullshit
is this? Jesus!
You bitch, you fucking bitch.
You ain't got the heart for this.
That's why you're gonna die.
Yeah, you're gonna die next.
Wherever the fuck it is you're
sending me, I'll wait for you.
I'll wait for you
to see you get what you're...
Use the gun!
Be careful, honey.
Just shoot him in his fat ass!
Good girl. Look out!
He's gonna aim for you!
Take cover. Take cover, baby.
Stay down. Go after him!
Baby, you gotta do this.
Go! Go! Go on.
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
'If I don't win the game, I want...'
I want my parents to know
that I love them a lot
and thank you... for everything.
'I don't know how I wanna be
remembered because...
'I haven't done anything yet
with my life.
'I haven't... done anything.'
'These cats...
'don't have...
'nine lives.'
'You are watching
The Contenders - Series Marathon.'
What are you gonna do?
Kill him again?
I have to make sure he's really dead.
You people are disgusting!
You're not even human,
you're just programmed to murder.
Tony was basically a good man.
- OK, calm down.
- What's wrong with you?!
Pat, can you get back
and give this woman some privarc?
She didn't sign up for this.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Listen to me,
I don't wanna do this kind of thing.
I have a baby on the way.
I know you can understand that.
I have to.
What's your name?
Michelle.
Did you see
the person who did this?
No.
'Hello and welcome
to The Contenders Telservice line.
'If you are calling to score
a kill, press "one" now.'
'Angel of Death Connie
scores the first kill of Series 7
'by eliminating Contender Tony
Reilly.
'This narrows the field to five -
'Dawn, Franklin, Lindsay,
Jeff, Connie.
'The Contenders.'
Here she is, here she is!
Oh God, she's alive.
She doesn't have a gun.
What happened to the gun?
Are you OK, sweetheart?
Get in the car.
Oh my God, you're not OK!
What happened?
Did you get him?
Oh! You're bleeding!
Did you get him?
- Put some pressure on that.
- Did you?
- Bob, she's bleeding.
- You didn't? Where's the gun?
Did you leave your gun
out there?
You're gonna take that 9mm you got
and you're gonna kill
that old fucker.
- Leave her alone!
- Don't start in on me.
Will you NOT start!
You are gonna go back out there,
you won't be afraid.
He's an old man!
Why... I HATE YOU!
I hate you both!
Lindsay! Oh my God, what did she do?
God, I'm bleeding!
Lindsay, come back!
It's her from the TV show.
Dawn?
Yeah.
OK, bye.
What did she say?
She wants to see me.
That'll be nice.
When?
I met Jeff in Senior Art class,
we worked together on a project,
a video-art project, and, um...
we pretty much fell right in love.
We collaborated on a project
for a video-art class in high school.
'I think Dawn had a crush on me.'
Dawn and Jeff were outsiders
in their high school.
Jeff listened to punk rock music
and Dawn was known as a pot-head.
They dressed in wild costumes
and wore them at school.
They enjoyed being confrontational.
They experimented with drugs.

'My friendship with Dawn was magical.
'Like... innocent.
'If it wasn't for Dawn...
'Dawn saved my life.'
It was one the hardest decisions
I've had to make in my life.
'It was hard enough
to get the abortion.
'Then my family threw me out.
I was 17!'
Dawn wasn't ready to be a mother,
I wasn't ready to be a father,
I just...
I think it was a bad time.
For her to say I abandoned her
really isn't fair.
That's not exactly how it went.
He told me he'd met someone.
And that he was probably gay
and that I shouldn't wait for him.
What?
Do you wanna speak to that?
Well... I don't...
I'm not sure what you want me to say.
Yeah, there was a...
I mean, there was a time where I was
experimenting and I was confused.
So when I went to college
there was this group of kids
Iooking to help this broken kid
accept a gay identity
but that's... that's not really...
Not really what I'm... what
I'm about any more, you know?
OK, I'm going in.
I promise I won't hurt him,
I just wanna talk to him.
You're still in love with him,
aren't you?
I knew it.
Look, I gotta talk to you.
Alone.
I'm sorry.
Jeff and I don't have any secrets
from each other.
If you want to say anything,
you can say it in front of me.
Doria, how about some drinks?
I'll have an apple juice.
Dawn?
I'd love a glass of milk, please.
'I thought Dawn was gone.
'I thought Dawn was a memory.'
'Seeing Jeff opened up
this whole other part of me
'that I knew nobody
on this show has ever seen.'
'In some ways I was grateful
to see her,
'in other ways, I know it's trouble.'
You look beautiful.
You look like shit.
Thanks.
Sit down.
It just feels...
I'm not ready to see you like this.
I'm sorry.
'When I hugged Jeff again, I...
'I could feel how thin he was.
'It sounds weird,
but I also recognised his smell.'
'It felt like ice
being broken,
'I just felt completely overwhelmed.
'In some ways
it felt like old times again.'
'It just felt good,
I mean... It felt like home.'
Hey,
I been... following you on the show.
Oh, yeah?
I'm very proud of you.
I want you to win.
I have to win.
I'll make this really easy
for you, Dawn.
It's like...
I'm not afraid of dying
but I'm scared shitless
of being killed.
That's why I want you to do it...
kill me.
But with an injection or something.
I came here to tell you
that I'm not gonna do it.
Please. I'm a human pin-cushion.
I know how to do it,
all you have to do is get the stuff.
Please, I...
I want it to be you...
and not some stranger.
Am I interrupting something?
Jesus! Doria,
I told you not to do that.
Sorry.
I don't have whole milk.
- Do you want 2 %?
- Yeah, thanks.
Thank you.
Here's the stuff.
This is where you get it.
I've got syringes.
What's going on?
Dawn's gonna kill me.
Now?
Now?
Don't fly off the handle.
Just calm down, please.
I don't need this right now.
Lindsay. Lindsay?
I gotta... Oh, Jesus!
- What?
- This came for you.
I think you should read it.
I think it's REALLY important.
I'm sure you've already read it,
so just tell me what it says.
Because I really want you to see it,
that's why. Come on.
OK.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
Show me.
No, it's just more fan mail.
'Coming up, who sent
these mysterious messages
'and what do they want?
'Plus, can Connie kill again?
'And, is Dawn ready
to extinguish an old flame?'
I want you to do it.
'Do you have what it takes
to survive The Contenders?
'Series Marathon.'
"Dear Contender,
I can help you to escape to safety.
"Meet me at closing at the mall,
"in front of the
Wicks 'n' Sticks Concession.
"Stay in plain view
and watch your back.
"Signed, a friend
from the Underground."
Are you sure you don't want
us to go with you?
Mom? Please.
Call us when you get there
and let us know where you are...
Hey! Constant contact, all right?
Your gun, let me see it.
Safety's on. OK.
Bye.
It's OK. I'm a Contender.
That's OK...
That's... That's my metal cane.
It's all right, don't worry.
Hey, gimme that!
This is definitely
a watch-your-back situation.
I got a bad vibe about this.
Five more minutes
and then I'm outta here.
What the hell?
What is she doing here?
Shit.
Look out!
Kill him, Lindsay!
The safety! The safety!
Everything you people believe
is bullshit.
It's time the American public should
be allowed to know what I know,
what I've known for a long time.
The show is a fake!
That bitch!
'Let's take a closer look
at what just happened.
'Dawn warns Lindsay but not in time.
'Franklin brutally beats the girl.
'Lindsay's safety jams
and Franklin scores the kill.
'Then the real shocker -
Franklin is shot by Connie,
'the cunning mastermind
behind this massacre.
'This narrows the field to three,
'Dawn, Jeff and Connie,
the Contenders.'
'I don't like being hunted.
'That's when it's time
to get pro-active.
'There's much more power
in being the hunter.'
Easy, baby.
Shit!
Damn it.
She probably went back to her condo,
I'm not sure.
Wait a minute! Is this her?
She stopped for a "Stop" sign!
Hi, Connie! That's right, baby.
Normally, I don't do car chases.
Innocent people can get hurt.
But this nurse has go to be stopped,
she's a fucking psycho.
There she is, I got her.
This is it.
Come on. Shit.
Shit.
Oh, that was intense.
- What's the matter?
- Weird cramps.
It's OK, baby.
Can you shut that off, please?
There's not enough light.
Why don't you go first, then?
Now we can't see anything.
Drop it, lady! I said drop it!
Jesus! I think my water just broke.
Are you shitting me?
I want to thank you...
for believing in my painting...
'Jeff says a heartfelt
goodbye to his beloved wife Doria
'as they await Dawn's return
to end his life.'
I thank you for every kiss...
for every hug,
for every smile when I was down,
for all the time you spent
with me in the hospital,
for holding my hand
when I was afraid.
You're the best thing that
ever happened to me, Doria.
You've been good for me.
What's the matter, monkey face?
Could you...?
Could you do something special
for me just for tonight?
Anything.
Will you say you're in love with me?
'Newbury Emergenrc
Unit. What's your emergenrc?'
Yes, I got a woman,
a Contender, ready to give birth.
I'm gonna have the baby right now!
- 'Is there a camera on?'
- Yeah, two cameras.
It's Eastwood Village, unit nine,
with the bright lights,
you better get someone here now.
I'm gonna have the baby right here.
- You're NOT having it here.
- But you're a nurse!
Five minutes ago
you were gonna kill me,
now you want me to play midwife?
We're talking about an innocent,
unborn baby here.
OK, I'll save the child
but then you're dead.
Get on the table.
Where is she?
What could have happened?
Maybe she got caught in traffic.
Maybe she had to stop
for another fix.
Maybe somebody got to her first
and killed her.
That's a terrible thing
to say, Doria.
She's going to be a mother.
Jesus! Just pull it out of me!
- 'Has her water broken?'
- Yes, all over my floors.
- 'Is the baby coming out?'
- Yes, it's coming.
- 'Is it crowning?'
- No, it's back or...
'That's bad, Connie. Now, I want...'
Oh, no! The feet's coming out.
'The feet? Connie, don't deliver
that baby, it's breach.'
- We need help here.
- 'They're coming soon.'
- 'OK, the feet are out?'
- The feet are out.
- 'The umbilical cord?'
- It's out.
'Don't cut it. Hold the feet up
to take pressure of its neck.
'Keep the baby's body supported,
tell her to breathe
'and not to push, NOT to push,'
Breathe, don't push.
Just pull it out!
People like you shouldn't be
allowed to have children,
you should be sterilised.
All you kids screwing around
like it's nothing.
Like you're so free!
Well, look at yourself now.
Fuck you!
You don't even know me.
I know you don't use contraception.
Crazy bitch!
What's crazy
is that welfare rewards you
for having illegitimate children.
Have a few more, why not?
Let's screw the whole country.
'Connie, listen.
If you don't create an airway
'you can cause brain damage
or even lose that child.'
- What?
- 'Make an airway.
'Push the vagina back.'
What are you doing?
- 'Is the head delivered?'
- Not yet.
- 'The chest?'
- No, but the stomach's out.
Let them in!
Oh, my God! Please let them in.
Would you get that door?
Get that door!
I can't let go of this baby!
'Connie? Connie...'
'Are you there?'
'Coming up next,
as two lives hang in the balance...'
Pull it out!
'Will Connie keep her word?'
I delivered your baby,
but I didn't deliver you.
'Plus, we know he's prepared to die,
'but nothing can prepare Jeff
for what happens next.
'The Contenders, the
game is real.'
'Jeff has remained
unconscious for the last 12 hours,
'hanging onto life by a thread.
'We burned hours of videotape
'to capture Jeff's waking moments.
'In a moment of tenderness,
'our reigning Contender
lets down her guard
'and greets the world
with her new baby.'
It's OK.
How about a photo
for The Times?
Hold up the baby.
Come on, no flashes.
Who do you think you'll kill next?
What's the baby's name?
I'm gonna name the baby Jeffrey.
To honour an old friend.
OK.
Oh, no, what happened?
'When Dawn didn't return
to fulfil her pact with Jeff,
'he could only assume the worst.
'He turned to his own wife
to assist him with his suicide.'
He turned to me because he knew
I was gonna be there for him.
If anyone was gonna kill Jeff,
it was gonna be me.
'Jeff is my husband.
'We thought... Jeff decided
that he'd use Secobarbatols.
'They're sleeping pills.
'I had some left over from
a prescription and he had some.
'Forty is supposed to be
a lethal dose, we had about 60.
'So I put a few more in
to be on the safe side.
'We had to do it in secret
'because taking your own life
is against the rules,
'not to mention the law.
'I'm not sure,
but I think it's also a sin.
'We embraced for a long time
before he took the drink.
'And then he smiled and said,
'"I'll see you in the next life."
'After a few minutes,
his breathing got really shallow.
'He seemed to be knocked out
or unconscious.
'So I took the last step and put
the plastic bag over his head.
'You're supposed to do that,
'I guess that way they suffocate.'
'But things didn't go
smoothly for Jeff and Doria.'
Is he gonna be OK?
Is he gonna be OK?
What do you mean I was legally dead?
You were dead, Jeff.
And they revived you.
- Revived me?
- Yes.
Who called the ambulance?
The cameraman. He got back in.
No, he didn't, Doria.
You let him in.
I put you in charge of my death
and you fucked it up.
I knew I should have waited for Dawn,
I owed her that much.
I would like...
I... signed on for the cancer
and I signed on for the ex-gay thing
and I gave up on our sex life,
a chance of ever having any children,
and I supported you when your
number came up in this show,
but THIS is too much.
I mean...
When were you gonna tell me
about this other person?
Who is this woman to you?
You obviously still have
feelings for her.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.
Why don't you go back to her?
Sooner or later she'll find out
that you're really gay anyway.
Here...
Here's your gun, here's your bullets,
Why don't you...?
Why don't you do it yourself?
Yeah, I didn't think so.
'To protect them
physically and emotionally,
'rules say that Contenders
be separated from young children
'for the duration of the programme.'
God damn it! Let me go!
'Dawn's emotional instability
'could jeopardise her standing
as a champion.
'Everything's on the line and nothing
can be taken for granted.
'Two lives, one winner.
'Showdown, the series finale,
is coming up.'
'This has been a very trying
time for me to say the least.
'But I believe my faith
has seen me through.
'Although it's hard to make
sense of it, I don't know.
'It's a miracle I'm here today
'and I don't take that lightly.
'It's a miracle.'
'Bless me Father for I have sinned,
'it has been one week
since my last confession.
'I accuse myself of being
impatient with a patient.
'I used the Lord's name in vain.
'I lied twice this week
and I had impure thoughts
'about a certain
television personality.'
'Anything else you'd like
to tell me?'
'No, Father.'
'Connie?'
'That's all.'
'I think to separate
a mother from her child
'is the worst thing
you could ever do to anybody.
'And...
'it hurts physically.
'It's worse than any physical
pain I've ever experienced.'
- No.
- It's all right.
- It's OK.
- No!
I'm trying to help you.
My God, Jeffrey.
I think I killed the nurse.
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?
Dawn, I don't want you
to kill me any more.
OK?
We're the only ones left.
'I was feeling betrayed.
'I could tell that
he had made up his mind
'and he didn't want
to talk about it.'
'She looked
so disappointed and angry
'and I wanted to say,
'"I'm sorry, I want to get out
of here, I gotta run."
'And I couldn't at the time
cos I was just so scared.'
'All I know is that he's the one
person that can still hurt me.
'And I don't want to allow
myself to be hurt any more.'
'My heart was just beating
really fast
'and I felt alive for
the first time in a long time.'
'Every time I think I know who
he is, he becomes somebody else.
'And here he is
abandoning me again.'
Where are you going?
I don't know.
Home.
Jeffrey...
where are you going?
Jeffrey?
JEFFREY!
Jeffrey!
'Dawn made a promise
to kill.'
I'm not afraid of dying.
'With her freedom at stake
'and her baby's future
on the line,
'will she keep her promise...'
I don't want you to kill me.
'..And shoot the only man
she's ever loved?'
'The Contenders.
One mistake and it's game over.'
I have no other choice,
I already killed myself
and it didn't work.
They brought me back like
a monster, what can I do?
They've got my baby.
For me to get her back,
I have to play this game.
He knows that.
It's not like I wanna do it,
but he said he would
and he's dying anyway.
My life's been
torn apart by this show,
I've been outed
in front of millions of people,
and my wife just walked out on me.
I got nothing to live for...
but I don't wanna die.

'Tonight, a very special
season finale of The Contenders.
'The ultimate battle is about
to begin.
'Dawn and Jeff have agreed
to meet at an undisclosed arena
'for the final confrontation.
'A deadly showdown,
and we'll be there.
'Will Dawn be able to eliminate Jeff
'or will her feelings
for him get in the way?
'Can Jeff change from an ex-gay
pacifist to a fierce Contender?
'Does he have the guts to do battle
with Dawn and get the job done?
'It's amazing that Dawn is up at all.
'She's still weak after
giving birth only hours ago,
'If Dawn can do this,
she will be free.
'And be reunited
with her new-born child.
'Jeff has undergone
a complete transformation,
'more than any Contender
we've ever seen.
'If Jeff can eliminate Dawn,
'he'll become
the new reigning Contender.
'They have everything to gain
and everything to lose.'
Jeffrey, let's not do this.
They're fucking with us, fuck them.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Turn off the camera now. TURN IT OFF!
Give me the camera.
Give it to me, man.
Give me the camera.
GIVE ME THE FUCKING CAMERA!
Turn it fucking off, Pat.
..Fucking bastard.
You wanna record something,
then record this you f...
'When they were last seen,
'Dawn and Jeff were driving
a pewter-coloured SUV.
'Dawn was wearing
a navy wool jacket,
'Jeff was wearing
a black trench coat,
'And then they disappeared.
'With the help of audience members,
'our agents can trace these fugitives
as they head through the city.'
'I spotted Dawn
at the corner of White and Main
'trying to get some money
but it wouldn't take her card.'
'This is John, they're
headed west on Milklane Road
'and they just left without paying.'
'It's getting late,
they're getting hungry,
'and time is running out.'
'They came into my store
just after eleven.
'Jeff held me at gunpoint
and Dawn took some baby food,
'half a dozen veggie burritos
'and a box of Power Bars.'
'Dawn and Jeff have
eluded our agents for over 24 hours.
'They're desperate and tired
'and more of a threat than ever.'
Are we on? You got me? Great.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, come on.
Ready?
All right, people. We have
a hostage situation here.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut up, now!
Sit down, sit down!
Everybody sit the fuck down!
No heroes here, all right?
If everyone just sits down
and chills out, nobody will get hurt.
I think you know why we are here
and what we want,
so just sit down chill out
and no one will get hurt.
Shut up!
I need to speak
to a human being, please.
Hi, this is Dawn of Dawn and Jeff.
Get out a pencil and write this down.
What we want is this -
bring me my baby and give us
safe passage across the border.
That's all we want.
If you don't do it in half an hour,
a lot of innocent people
are gonna get hurt here.
That means you, assholes.
Listen to me, one half-hour,
that's it.
I'm not fucking around.
'Due to a technical error,
'the footage you are about
to see was destroyed.
'But we spared no expense
'in reconstructing the scene
as it really happened.'
OK...
Dawn, Jeff, you've been making
some big demands tonight,
Iet's talk and see
if we can work it out.
There's nothing to talk about.
Just give me my baby
and no one will get hurt.
You know I can't do that, Dawn.
Let's be reasonable.
How about I just blow
your brains out?
OK, here it is.
You can have your baby back
on one condition,
that you shoot Jeff right
in front of us and end the game.
- What?
- Just give me my baby.
Do you hear that?
It's your baby, Dawn.
She needs her mother.
She needs you.
It's up to you, Dawn.
Jeff was the only thing
standing between
Dawn and her freedom.
Given their past,
he might betray her again.
Would she be able to do it?
You can't make me do this.
I won't do it.
Do it, Dawn.
It's OK.
I want you to win,
I want you to be with your baby.
Quick,
before I change my mind again.

'Dawn Lagardo, Jeffrey Norman,
'they were soul mates, warriors,

'But we will always remember
them as... Contenders.
'Next time on The Contenders,
'as one life begins...'
Little Dawn's safe.
'..Another comes to an end.
'The final plea
of a crazed killer.
I am innocent. You people did this.
'Plus... a new town.
'Five new Contenders

'Our new reigning Contender.'
