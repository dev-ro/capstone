[Off-screen:] -"...as bound by duty
"of office, I ask you to acknowledge this vote."
Madam President, I accept the vote.
[TV:] "After long anticipation in Bonn
Richard von Weizäcker won the election.
He won more votes than his prior elections.
It's his greatest success since Theodor Heuss.
It's no coincidence; he starts his second term,
the same day West Germany's basic law became law
on May 23, 1949, 40 years ago."

- Let's have a toast. Finish that later.
Let's celebrate now!
- We'll just have a sip
- We'll do the rest
Would you do the honors and open this?
[Somber music]
[Karl narrates:] I can't recall how often I've read "Illuminatus."
50 times?
60 times?
One part was most interesting.
'All great anarchists die on the 23rd of the month.'
The 23rd is a good day to die."

[Film based on a true story]
[Brokdorf, 1985]
This is an illegal protest. Disperse or we'll use force.
[Chanting] - No Nuclear Plants!
- Karl!
Come back!
Look out!
- Care to explain these?
- Where'd you get these?
- Nevermind that.
They'd been in the paper if not for me.
You're a disgrace.
- Why am I?
We're fighting to fix your generations mistakes.
- Nonsense.
If you were better informed, you'd realize you're wrong.
[Karl narrates:] "My father was editor of a Hanover right-wing newspaper.
We argued non-stop.
With a father like him, there are two choices:
give up and conform...
...or rebel."
Finished!?
Good day!
Beate?
Want to meet in the meeting room?
- Sure. I'll tell Alex.
- 'Taz' has '10,000 peaceful demonstrators.'
- 'Frankfurter Rundschau', reports '8,000 organized against atomic power.'
- but 'Hannoversche Rundschau': 'under 5,000 demonstrators
many of them violent radicals.'
- Thats crap!
- Is this your dad's doing?
- It's what he likes.
- Right-wing press falsifies numbers
- See what your missing!
[Off-screen] - Karl...
Is this your doing?
- Is it illegal to express opinion?
- Get 'Cactus', the new 'Cactus'...
Hey! Stop that shit! What about, 'freedom of the press?'
- You know it's libelous.
You know it's not true.
- Prove it.
- I'll vacate your room...
- Oh yeah...
- if you don't learn respect.
- And put your whore-mistress in my room.
- I'd care less if you dropped dead.
[Karl narrates:] "Half a year later my father was dead.
He died from a brain tumor.
In some way, I felt responsible but,
I couldn't feign grief.
Unlike my step mother;
she got bonds and the house.
I inherited 50,000 DM and his desk.
I withdrew the money right-away.
Saving wasn't my style.
[up-beat 80's rock music]
- Why didn't you move-in?
- I'd rather not live alone.
- Interested?
Plenty of room.
- What's the catch?
- You do what you want here...
freedom for everyone!
[Cheering, and yelling]
[Music and chatter]
- Why are you alone out here?
- I'm taking a break.
- Don't you like the party?
- A bit crowded.
I don't know most people.
- It's OK.
I like having many people over.
Want to join me?
Something I want to show you...
His associates found it in his desk.
- 'National Research Award'...
Great haircut!
- I won it when I turned 14.
That's the author...
Robert Anton Wilson
- He looks strange.
- Dad made a mistake...
thought it was a kid's book.
When he knew the truth, he confiscated it.
Now it's all mine again.
- "Nothing is true. Everything's permitted.
World history is war between secret societies."
- Wilson says the world isn't what it seems.
A secret society controls all
the Illuminati.
But Hagbard Celine is a rebel,
an anarchist on a submarine.
From there he fights Illuminati.
He has a computer on the a sub
computing risk of World War III with simulations.
- Mmmhm
- Computer's named, "Fuck Up".
- What?
- Fuckup: First Universal Cybernetic Kinetic Ultra-micro Programmable
If you want, I'll lend it to you.
- I guess.
[Rock music:] "Reality at last, Ten bottles of wine, all empty too fast!"
- Pizza anyone? [grabs money]
[Doorbuzzer]
- End this now or I'll call the cops
- Alex [turn it down]
- Who pissed on the mailboxes? What a mess!
- Who's that whiner?
- My landlord.
[Music stops]
My landlord says he'll call the cops. It's over. Go home.
[crowd disharmony]
[Karl narrates:] "Beate didn't take 'Illuminatus,'
Alex only read parts on sex and drugs.
He plain, 'didn't get it.'
What Wilson's wrote about assassinations was riveting.
I repeatedly read it, and sought other believers.
BBS were populated by people like me.
I got a computer and joined my peers.
Just a simple computer.
Only a Commodore, but it served my needs.
[keyboard clicks]
I felt I discovered a new continent.
I visited my global neighbors.
It didn't take long to choose a name
[your name: HAGBARD CELINE]
[Heavy Click]
[Static/Noise]
On a BBS where 'Illuminatus' was argued,
I read Wilson would visit a Hamburg Chaos Computer Club meeting.
[Passenger reading ,'Illuminatus']
Many computer freaks attended from all over Germany.
Many were inert but some had skills.
It's like converting a harmless child's toy into a bomb.
'Scarabeus' hacked Frankfurt airport's flight arrival board
'Conan' took-over Luxemburg's power grid.
'Fishball' had an illegal mail server at GAC. (Geneva Atomic Center)
Then there was 'David' from Hanover.
His net-name was 'Goliath'.
- We're now discovering that the true source of wealth
is information, and it increases as it's shared.
[Karl narrates:] "Wilson said computers will revolutionize society.
Information will be more important than money.
Knowledge is power and will be controlled by few.
Hagbard Celine fights these 'few'.
I saw 'Illuminatus' meant more than I thought.
- Know what's interesting?
The Illuminati's' secret number.
- It's 23.
- And 5.
- Why 5?
- 5 is the sum of those digits.
The U.S. DoD is in the Pentagon;
it has five sides.
- So. you think Illuminati are there, eh?
- Who knows?
Either way, the part on assassinations is true.
Many occurred on the 23rd.
- Kennedy was killed on the 22nd.
- Oswald on the 24th, and 23 is between.
- Must you talk shit in the middle of the night?
- But do Illuminati exist? Wilson gives no proof.
- Whether it's the Illuminati, P2, the Rosicrucians
We know for fact, secret societies exist.
- Yeah but sometimes...
his work suggests he's smoked one too many joints.
- Drugs aren't bad...  ...They
stimulate thought, insight, fantasy.
Right?
- Yeah, of course.
Would you smoke a joint here?
- Sure... obviously...
But I have none.
Nice! [laughs]
Would you sing a song here?
- Like what?
- "Thoughts are Free," while standing up.
- You know the words?
[Singing] -"Thoughts are free, nobody else knows them.
They fly by, like shadows in darkness."
[Singing] - No man can know them, no hunter can hit them.
[Singing continues...]
- You'll have to stop this.
- Why don't you all join us?
- Thanks for nothing!
Where in hell are we?
- Fallingbostel. A *lovely* town...
- I've a Biology test at 12 and it's almost 11.
- 11 + 12 = 23.
- Is that a good or bad sign?
[Upbeat rock music]
[From Song:] "I am a passenger
and I ride and I ride...
I ride through the city that sighs...
I see the stars come out in the sky...
Yeah they're bright and high in the sky...
You know it looks so good tonight...."
- You noticed anything about VW?
'V' is Roman 'five' and 'W' is the 23rd letter of the alphabet.
- 'Brockhaus: knowledge of the world in 23 volumes.'
- No: 24.
- Really?
- I own it.
- Bummer.
Apollinaris, the world is a spring.
- It's only a triangle.
- Nope... a pyramid.
[Music continues]
- 23 is all around us.
Consider, human chromosomes.
passed down...
you know....
- 'pile driving'. [sex]
- We're not a, 'building site.'
How many?
- People?
- No, chromosomes.
- 23?
- Good guess: 23!
- Anyway, 'Illuminatus' is fiction. It's a novel.
- Oh yeah?
What's this?
- A dollar.
- The Illuminati symbol...
on the world's most important money.
Who's this?
- George Washington.
- Then this is George Washington.
- That's right.
- Nope. That's Adam Weishaupt.
- He was an Illuminati founder in Ingolstadt, in 1776.
- Bah. Unbelievable.
- When Illuminati were persecuted he left for America.
Eliminated Washington, became President.
That's why the Masonic pyramid is on the dollar.
- Bullshit. They just shared similar wigs.
- Let's break for the coast... Well?
- What about school?
- What about the sea?
Come with me? Let's get out a bit.
- I haven't heard from you in weeks, now you want to go out?
- Yeah, why not?
- There's a rally this weekend. We need as many people as possible.
- What's the point? Stomp around. Yell. Get hosed with water?
We can get wet at the sea.
- Don't trivialize the rally.
Anyway, I must work. I've only got 20 DM
- Here.
With this, you can come along.
Take it.
- Do you think I'm for sale?
- I want us to spend time together.
- You've become an asshole since your dad died.
I don't care about your money.
Hey! What are you doing?
- The damn money is nothing but bad luck.
I don't want it.
[TV:]"Hanover: City to the largest computer show
We'll be connected and travel the world with modems.
But where's the security?"
- Good day viewers, let me introduce you to a hacker.
He's from Hanover and uses the name
Hagbard and is just a teen!
How long you been a hacker?
- A few months.
- Hagbard, what is a hacker?
- Hackers find and exploit holes in system security.
- Uh-huh. What is this?
- The Post Office BTX systems.
They say you can access your bank accounts,
but the security is lame. We mess around with it,
and say, "this is broken. Fix it."
- You tell the victims?
- Of course, we do no harm.
- Is there an ethic among hackers?
- Knowledge is power. Correct information is money. Incorrect information is poverty.
Information wants to be free.
[Off-screen] - Any job offers?
[Off-screen] - No comment.
- Hello.
- Hi
- What your friend is doing is interesting.
- Computer nerds like Hagbard are our future.
Raised on microchips;
bits and bytes are their toys.
- This guy's full of shit.
Why talk to him?
- Improve our hacker image.
- And get 200 Marks, Right?
- I didn't give away any secrets.
Besides, you sleep, smoke and drink here.
And whose phone did you use all night? Mine.
- Karl? Let me introduce you to someone.
This is Lupo. Lupo, this is Karl.
- Hey there.
What you're doing is a joke.
Really. The Post Office BTX is so... amateur.
- Are you a hacker?
- No, no, not even close.
- I program the big iron.
- But not in Hanover.
- No, Berlin.
A job with Continental.
in the sales division.
- Lupo says we're wasting our talent
- Yep: time to redistribute wealth.
Why not hack nuclear plants, or American military and tech?
- And then?
- Then we aid the guys with less technology.
Sleep on it.
My friend has Russian contacts.
[Baby crying]
- Is Pepe here?
- On the balcony.
- You can make money selling data to the east.
- We're about ethics.
- Ethics? World is full of assholes;
only assholes will survive.
- Well, I'm into ethics.
Let's hear them out.
- Democracy requires equality.
Information must be free.
So networks should be open.
- I don't understand this stuff.
- U.S. satellites can predict famine for up to 6 months.
People die without access to that information.
- Technology-wise, the east is 3rd world.
Let's stop the damn Yanks from hoarding it all.
You hack, Pepe delivers.
- Wait a second and hold up;
we barely know each other.
- It's what I said when I found she was pregnant.
- Industrial espionage is dangerous
The feds will be on our tail.
- Are you a spectator or a player?
[TV:] "Olaf Palme is dead.
He was assassinated in Stockholm last night.
Two shots from a gun ended his life"
- Who's Palme?
- A politician, I bet.
- Swedish PM or something...
- Smörrebröd.
- God, he looks stupid.
- Can't you shut up?
Come on! Take some dope and get out.
- What's wrong?
- It's important.
[TV:] "... were shocked by Palme's murder.
U.S. President Reagan called this tragedy a great loss."
- What we have on Palme: Police arrived immediately
but no roadblocks for 24 hours.
Fake police uniforms were found. The cops tried a cover-up.
They were after a lone gunman.
- It says, "they ignored clues
of a plot and organized crime."
Like how Kennedy's death was framed on Oswald!
- Illuminati grew powerful quickly, and were banned ten years later.
So they spread underground and grew while practicing the occult.
- They renamed everything. They made their own Calendar.
They renamed Munich, 'Athens.'
Weishaupt renamed himself Sparticus.
- Members included... Mozart, Herder, von Knigge
Goethe...
[TV:] "The police report..."
[Sound of tape being rewound]
- Unbelievable!
A day has 24 hours,
an hour has 60 minutes...
He was killed at 23:23!
- You're saying the Illuminati did it?
- There are conspiracies which we will never know about.
- CIA and so on...
- It doesn't matter, he was on a hit list.
I've thought about what Lupo said.
I think we should use our talents.
[Karl narrates:] "Pepe was a good guy.
He sold cars, housewares and drugs.
As I got to know him, I began to doubt his, 'Russian contacts'
Lupo returned to Berlin
and Pepe worked locally.
He asked us to use a codeword "Paris" for East Berlin.
We'd ask when we go to Paris, he answered...
- I'll go there soon.
[Karl narrates:] "I almost forgot about it until he called a meeting.
He had a crazy story but wouldn't say over the phone.
Pepe went to East Berlin and the Russian embassy."
- I wanted someone from the KGB.
The stupid clerk played dumb.
I told him, "Oh well, I'll try the Chinese."
Suddenly, he got wise and asked me to stay.
[Russian instrumental folk music]
[Book: "Speak Russian"]
- Peter Conrad?
- Yeah.
[Russian:] "How do you do?
Glad to see you."
- I speak German. Hello.
Mr. Conrad, I need to know...
Why do this?
- I hate Americans;
they're imperialists.
- You're a Communist?
- No. I'm a free man of the world.
I told him our story.
He talked to his supervisor a bit.
[distant hushed conversation]
I couldn't make out their words,
but they'll take all you can get.
- On your next visit,
please don't come here.
This is my office on Leipzig Street.
And don't bring your car.
- I understand.
- Here, put this by your computer.
["German Soviet Friendship"]
Now its up to you guys.
[Karl narrates:] "We hacked into everything we could.
We took files from colleges, corporations and libraries.
It was really easy most of the time.
People weren't creative with their passwords.
Some used 'password' others their pet's or wife's name.
We worked at night for cheaper phone rates.
Our weeks had 6 days of 28 hours.
Which caused problems."
- We're closed.
- Bach was a hacker of music.
Instruments were his computers
It's the same forwards or backwards.
Then he was a Mathematician,
but he would be a programmer today.
[Karl narrates:] "We packed the first delivery.
Weeks of work gave us many disks
Pepe believed himself 'James bond.'
He tried to walk and talk like a spy
He got a nice briefcase for deliveries.
- Becoming a big businessman?
- I can't use a plastic bag.
It'll look bad.
He wants to meet you.
- Who?
- Our man in Paris.
He wants to meet you the first time.
[Upbeat music]
What sort of crap car is this?
Dies when you take your foot off!
It sucks!
- Why didn't we take yours?
- Go.
- There's the line.
- Right here. Stop. Stop!
- Fuck! You went too far!
- Go back.
- No don't!
- Stay cool; I'll deal with it.
Hey, you should repaint that line, you know?
[Karl narrates:]"They opened the case. I thought, 'It is over.'
But Pepe showed them Segei's card.
After a phone call, we could go.
It was like a bad spy movie."
- Be seeing you. Good luck.
- You coming?
- No.
[Karl narrates:] "Lupo dodged mandatory military service.
He ignored this law
and hid in a Berlin hotel.
He only left Berlin by plane.
Internal flights have no ID check.
Our planning was poor:
working with a dealer and deserter"
[Sounds of train on tracks]
- Your briefcase, please.
- What about the money?
- Evaluation first, then talk money.
- But I do want it back.
- In socialism, nobody gets robbed.
Hagbard... Interesting name.
You lost your parents early...
I'm sorry.
Your father was a journalist?
- Yes.
- Sorry to pry into your life,
but we've never dealt with partners so young.
We should discuss a few rules.
- No problem. I've explained some things to them.
- Excuse me.
We find your data... useful.
Sign if you please.
Bureaucracy cuts across borders.
[Middle Eastern music]
- Key?
- The key...
- Open up!
- I'm cold!
- It's lost.
- Where?
- Don't know.
- I'll go back.
- Nah. Wait. There's another way.
- We'll send your data to Moscow.
They'll check it and then we'll see.
I'll tell you know what we need:
phone numbers and passwords.
- Passwords are not so easy.
- I know.
- If the price is good, we'll do it.
- Don't worry Mr Conrad.
Just do your best.
I'm eager to see your next drop.
[Karl narrates:] "Things ran smoothly for months; we delivered for cash.
But hacker arrests were in the media
Laws against hackers were passed.
We didn't worry, but systems were better protected.
I needed more coke to work longer on the computer.
I spent my inheritance.
I needed money to pay Pepe.
To get it, we worked 24 hours/day
David's dad got him a new Atari for his Birthday.
He was focused to make a new program
It used most common passwords,
connected to a system and iterated over each one."
[On-screen:] [PASSWORD UNKNOWN], [PASSWORD:******]
"It was too much for the poor Atari"
- Two weeks gone!
It was to be a surprise.
- It's a brilliant idea...
The Atari just can't keep up.
- We're like amateurs!
- Relax...
We need a mainframe.
- Pay your debts first.
You owe me 5,000 Marks.
- 4,000!
- 5,000!
- 4,000!
- Sometimes I think you dislike me, Hagbard
Try getting your coke somewhere else
You'll see what it really costs.
I like you, so you get a discount.
[Upbeat music]
[Ad: "Plastics and Elastics from Schkopau"]
- You heard of a Micro PDP-11?
- I've heard of it.
- There's a used one in Darmstadt for 10,000 Marks.
- Call me if there's a problem
and get a proper contract.
- Don't you trust our skills?
- The PDP-11:
Predecessor to the Micro PDP-11
- Not the same?
- Nope. Like I said...
the micro PDP-11 was sold, but this is still a great choice.
Good performance, larger, and robust
It runs fine.
- Great deal, Eh?
- Yep. It's from Jülich Atomic CO; a real workhorse.
- Atomic plant Central Office?
- Yeah-yeah.
And their requirements are strict.
- Shit.
- Lupo isn't home.
- Shouldn't we try Pepe?
- He's clueless.
- The salesman must think we're crazy.
- Let's get it.
- It's perfect!
- Someone else might take it.
[Motor whines]
[Upbeat music]
- Done.
- Good.
- This monster is totally high-tech!
- It's a predecessor: bit larger, a true workhorse.
- It's from Jülich Nuclear Plant CO. Here is the receipt.
With all these docs, we can hack into Jülich.
Notes from AEC!
(AEC=Atomic Energy Commission)
- Wait and shut your trap...
I need to think.
- What's wrong?
- I said to buy a micro PDP-11, right?
- Yeah, but this...
- This needs 3-cycle high voltage.
- We'll get a connection.
- *and* an air conditioner,
or you'll get a dry sauna.
- We tried to call you.
- And this? Is this busted?
- The controller?! Unbelievable!
- We'll get it fixed.
- We'll return it.
- You can't! Read the receipt.
- We'll make it work within a week.
- I don't believe it! All my money, down the drain!
Bastards!
- I'll talk to him
- Don't. Leave him be.
- Shit! Damn!
Move it! Move it!
[Karl narrates:] "We had to keep using my Commodore.
Our deliveries fell behind so Pepe postponed meeting Sergei.
I desperately needed money to pay Pepe and Lupo.
Many hackers met at a Hanover pub.
The guy who interviewed me before,
wanted people for a new TV program.
He had no computer skills, so
I turned the PDP-11 docs from Jülich into a story."
- Jochen, you want to see this.
We hacked into the Jülich nuclear plant.
Check the docs.
- What? You hacked Jülich?
- Yeah.
- What would that story be worth?
- Depends. What happened?
- We moved the fuel rods up and down
- Really? Just your commodore?
- Yeah, it's very easy.
- Are you willing to prove that?
- What do you mean?
- Hack a nuclear plant on camera.
[TV:] "After the U.S. imposed boycott,
fighting broke out in Syrte, Libya.
Lybian warships fired warning shots at U.S. aircraft carriers.
Revolutionary leader Mohmar Kadafi
restated his claim for the Gulf and 12 miles of ocean
U.S. Secretary of State Schulz will only accept...."
- Thank you.
- OK. He's ready.
- We're considering a show on this.
Are you interested?
Maybe some interviews.
Show Mr. Maiwald the scene
show him secrets.
- Of course you'll be anonymous.
You want people to know, right?
- Right, people need to know.
- Absolutely.
- Nuclear power is dangerous.
- If a guy with a Commodore can...
- Ok. Essentially we agree.
- I'd like to talk it over a bit.
- Did you see what he smokes?
"Ernte 23."
- Let's make a decision.
- Maybe they broadcast on UHF 23.
Illuminati control this network.
Okay. What we'll do...
We sit down and hack into Jülich,
and get paid to do it.
Fine, but...
no interviews or scene intro.
- Jochen's clueless...
- He may seem harmless, but he has a hidden agenda.
- Breaking into Jülich is a crime.
If it leaks out as our doing,
the network is in trouble.
- I'll be very careful.
We'll do it at my place.
Then I'll call Jülich...
and see if they noticed.
- If this go bad, I know nothing.
This is your responsibility.
If you succeed, you'll get a steady job.
- Thanks. I'd like that.
- It's okay, Maiwald.
What is their advance?
- I offered them 5,000.
- Here.
- What is that?
- This is the first half.
You'll get the rest later.
- Where'd you get it?
- I sold some stuff...
records, furniture...
- I hear you met a journalist.
- Yeah, that guy hangs around,
but I just play around with...
- Ask before doing anything dumb.
- I won't do it. You know me!
- All right!
We're a team... Right?
The wish list from Sergei...
He only wants the best.
I know, they're tough to crack.
Do what you can.
I'd hate to disappoint him.
- Arms manufacturers, military...
- We're fighting for world peace.
- But one-way hashed passwords...
- He'll pay 60,000 for them.
You could pay your debts and relax for a change.
[Sound: air through straw]
[Karl narrates:] "Everything was out of control.
We were no longer about fighting the system.
Captain Hagbard abandoned his war on conspiracy.
Thinking I fought Illuminati,
was I really their puppet?
We'd become contract workers; spies for the KGB's."
[Somber instrumental music]
- Shit, the cops! What's up?
- No idea.
[TV:] "The La Belle Disco was a scene of horror this morning.
The explosion that occurred just after midnight
has claimed two lives so far, one a U.S. soldier.
Over 200 people were injured.
Just hours after the bombing, a U.S. representative speculated
Lybians illegally crossing from East Berlin are to blame."
- Where are you now, Hagbard?
- We took the Datex line to the computer's gateway.
- It's wants me to login.
- You need a password?
- Yep.
- Where did you get it?
- A trade secret.
- It's illegal. Aren't you scared...
- No.
- Okay. What's next?
How do we move the fuel rods?
- First, we look around.
- Then?
- Then nothing.
- Why not?
- You can't get to that.
- Okay, let me rephrase it...
Can a hacker manipulate plant controls?
You moved the rods up and down, yes?
- Bullshit, who said that?
- Basically, it's very simple...
- You're not making an ass of me!
We hacked Jülich, that's it, ok?
No more stupid questions.
- David...
- David!
- What is that crap about rods?
- I had to bait him.
- And if he makes a big story of it?
- Calm down. Nothing happened.
- I can't pay you any more now.
I'll see what we have,
and see if I can make a program.
- And then?
- We'll keep in touch
- I'll call you.
- Fine.
- Oh... Hello Mr Koch.
- Hello.
- We're reading meters for billing.
I looked around. The carpet's burned
and wine was spilled.
- I'll fix it up, don't worry.
- Sounds good.
- You've changed since started hangin' with those dicks.
- Do it again and you're out of here
- It's just my opinion.
- Not that. You let the landlord in.
Don't do it again.
- I didn't let anyone in.
Brückner's got his own key.
- He should notify us.
He can't just sneak around here.
[Doorbuzzer]
- I've looked everywhere for you.
- You going to let me in?
Where's he been?
- I think I want this lock.
- Do I get a second key?
- Not at this special price.
- I can make you a duplicate.
- Okay.
[Sound of metal grinding]
- Look at these. Nice, eh?
- Pepe, I've got an idea!
Passwords are like keys.
We've been testing locks on doors to see if one was open.
- Here...
- We need to copy keys.
It's really simple.
- Wait! My shoes!
- The ankle boots.
- Here you are.
- This computer's door is locked
and we have no key.
We just make a second door.
A program that acts like a real door
Someone keys a password.
Our door says, 'Wrong. Try again'
He's surprised, keys it in again,
and enters via the real door.
Ahh... Here's the catch,
our door saves the password.
Finished!
It just needs a name.
- How about, "Spread legs and enter"
- No.
[On screen: Trojan Horse]
Trojan Horse
- Why that?
- It was used to conquer Troy.
- You're too much.
- Karl, it just snarfed a password
They took the bait!
- That's odd...
- What?
- The 2nd floor lights are on.
It's a forwarding agency.
They seldom ever work this late.
- Let's get back to work.
- What's going on?
- It's my going away present.
I'm moving out.
[Cautious music]
- What's up, smurfs?
- We got lots of stuff.
- Good, we meet Sergei tomorrow.
- So soon?
- That's right.
Work all night if you must.
- I've been up 24 hours.
- So? We work for world peace.
Open your hand.
- What is this?
- You too.
Amphetamine.
Makes you super-hackers
If it all works out
we'll have a party at Lupo's
[TV:] "The conflict between Libya and the U.S. is intensifying.
Revolutionary leader Kadafi again claimed the entire Gulf.
Foreign minister Genscher seeks
to stop American bombing of Libya.
33 American war planes await attack orders."
[Sound of jet engine]
[Sounds of battle]
[Sound of passing car]
[Car Horn]
- Karl? Time to go...
- Just a sec.
[Whine of tires on road]
- Hear that?
I hear planes.
- Are you sick?
- They are bombing the cities.
- It's the Winter tires.
They whine a bit.
- Should we stop?
- Too late, they're coming.
- Who's coming?
[Sound of jet]
- What's going on?
- Shit! Get out!
- Let me out!
- What's he doing?
- Damn it, Karl!
Pull yourself together!
- Hey. Hagbard.
What's wrong with you?
- How long was I sleeping?
- About 5 hours.
- I really screwed it up, eh?
- Nuh-uh. Greetings from Sergei.
He really liked your work.
I convinced Sergei to pay more.
- I knew you were reliable.
[TV:] "U.S. jets have bombed the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi.
The US attacked military targets,
but there were civilian deaths.
Revolutionary leader Kadafi threatened retaliation.
The conflict could spread across all the Middle East."
- The Illuminati are here.
- I can't see them. Show me.
- I sense them.
- This is getting old.
- Fix your broken record.
- Give him a break Lupo.
- Why not eat or drink something?
- Well?
- No change.
- He can't shake it.
- Hey Hagbard.
You know that Illuminati stuff?
I think I feel it too.
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.
- I feel it right here.
- What do you feel?
- These voices
- It's burning here and my ass.
- What do the voices say?
- I can't quite tell.
It burns. Have a look.
Drop your pants, you may have it!
- Karl, hold a sec.
He just wanted you to laugh.
- This is nothing to laugh at.
This is important!
- Karl, this damn 23 is but a game.
- Not to me.
Maybe to you.
Don't you see what's happening?
- You don't seem to.
You nearly jumped from a car
at 180 kmph!
- What do you think we're doing?
David!
Don't you get it?
- Don't say you saw Illuminati.
You know your problem?...Coke.
- What's coke got to do with it?
Promise you'll never leave me?
I have no one else.
- I don't like it.
- Fisher Agency... Got it.
5 4 2 1 4 7
[On the phone:] - Fisher Forwarding Agency.
- Yeah, Müller here.
Are the federal agents still there?
- Excuse me?
- Agent Müller. Put on my colleagues
- Just a sec. Connecting you.
- Hello?
- They're cops
- Don't touch anything. Stop!
- Who could have known?
- Maybe Alex said something?
- No, maybe my landlord.
I haven't paid rent for ages.
- Maybe that's it. They said,
"You will let them stay."
- Why?
- The place is bugged.
- Could they get in somehow?
- Sure, I saw a guy there with my landlord.
- They've got nothing.
It's not a crime to use a computer.
You only saw Sergei once.
They didn't pick up on that.
- So what do they want with me?
- It's a tactic; they follow until you panic and fuck-up.
- I'm out.
Cracking mainframes was fun,
but now I understand them.
- They've no proof or they'd arrest you.
- There's too much risk. I don't want to go to jail.
- Cops are dumb as shit.
- They don't know a disk drive from a toaster-oven.
We're always one step ahead.
- They're after you for drugs, not hacking.
- Pepe's a dealer; you buy from him.
- What are you saying?
- Take a look at yourself.
- Got a problem?
- Yeah.
- Spit it out.
- I think you told a whore.
- Shut up, asshole.
- Don't touch me.
- Hey, hey, hey!
[Argument continues]
- Must I to deal with that dwarf?
- He's the smartest of us.
- Shut up all of you! Damn it!
- Jerk-off!
- We're a team. We've come this far
and we won't let stupid cops piss in our corn flakes.
We're talking 15,000 Marks each, so don't panic.
We'll just lay low a few days.
Nobody meets anyone else.
No activities.
Then we get the last data at a hotel
and get everything on Sergei's list
We clear?
- 15,000 for each of us.
- For you, only if you want to.
- Let's do this one last job,
then we'll ditch those pricks.
Okay. We'll do it.
Because we want, not for you.
- Of course, because you want...
- If it goes bad, Sergei may help
He'll fly us to Moscow.
- *Great* idea.
- Worse than Hanover.
[Suspenseful music]
[Footsteps on stairs]
- Mr Brükner...
Hello?! Mr Brükner?
- Mr Koch
- I wondered about my rent.
- Your rent?
- Yes, I'm behind by two months.
- I didn't notice...
Then just pay it!
- You had to noticed!
And if I don't pay?
I won't pay! Not a cent!
Throw me out!
I want you to give me notice!
- Everything okay?
- Promise you'll logoff if it looks strange?
- No problem.
- It's only one night.
- You promised.
- I know.
I stand by that.
I'm off the stuff.
But I need it tonight.
- You want a break?
- I'll be okay.
What's this?
- A trace! Disconnect!
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.
- Why?
- It means they're tracing us.
Let's take off.
- Put more money in.
- Here's something.
The last thing on Sergei's list.
- Know what it is?
- No, I'll get it. It's short.
- There's a strange car!
- Then check it out.
- What is it?
- Some Russian cities.
- A nuclear war game-plan.
- Stop freaking out!
- Look, nuclear power plants. See?, size, codes, capacity...
- That's how war will start; they'll blow them up.
- Stop it! You're stressing me out!
- No!
- Out!
[Alarm beeping]
[Radio:] "The news: Moscow. The Soviet news agency, TASS,
reports a failure in Chernobyl's nuclear power plant.
The amount of damage is unknown.
Efforts are underway, but no details reported yet.
Finland and Sweden report higher radioactivity.
- That was our fault!
I know it's our doing.
- Come off it, now.
- I saw Chernobyl on your screen.
- We weren't in Chernobyl.
It's just coincidence.
- What I fear will happen
is what ends up happening!
- If people want to bomb Chernobyl
they won't need your help.
They don't rely on you to think it
- They're stealing my thoughts.
I don't know how, but they do.
When my dad died, Tripoli, Olaf Palme...
I think it, and then it happens.
[Sound of helicopter]
[Radio:] "The reactor incident in the Chernobyl plant
is the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power."
[News reports: in many languages about Chernobyl]
[Knocking at door]
- Karl? [Knocking on door]
[Distorted voices and noise]
[Noise increases]
[Silence]
[Muffled horns]
[Distressed breathing]
['Wheel of Fortune' on TV]
- Hello
I brought some of your clothes and books.
I took the questionable stuff to my place.
That's okay with you, right?
I'm not speaking to Lupo and Pepe.
We...
They searched hacker homes in Hamburg.
We were lucky we quit in time.
- I wasn't lucky.
- Sorry.
- I've had a tough time since...
Sometimes it's like I'm driving down a winding road.
Suddenly, I feel I've no control.
Someone else controls it.
Maybe the Illuminati don't exist.
Maybe they never did.
Then I'd be crazy.
- Don't fixate on what we did, ok?
- I'll only think of the future.
I'll be out of here next week, in Rehab.
[Karl narrates:] "I couldn't wait to leave Rehab
but when the time came, I felt hopeless and weak."
[Woman:] "...here we cook and eat together..."
[Karl narrates:] "The home offered a sheltered world.
The medication calmed me and drove my fears away.
I slowly recovered and tried to forget.
These past events seemed surreal
until Jochen Maiwald stopped by."
- I can guess you have problems,
but now I have a problem.
The cops came to work...
with a search warrant.
- Shit.
How could that happen?
- I don't know.
They searched my office and house.
They took material for the show.
- And the video tape?
- No, not that, but the printouts.
They have the Jülich stuff.
- So? Now what do we do?
- My boss would like to chat.
- I can't leave this place.
- Karl, he is here. Come on.
It'll be quick.
- You must confess.
You hacked into Jülich on your own
Neither Mr. Maiwald nor anyone else asked you.
We only paid you for an interview.
- Have they got my name?
- We've postponed this too long,
and network must be protected.
It's difficult for us all. Maiwald could lose his job.
- I can't tell the cops.
I'm ill.
- Illness will help your defense.
It was just a stupid joke.
You'll only face a fine.
- Let me think about it.
I'll talk to David.
I'll see what he says.
- You have 1 day, then our lawyer will give up your name.
Sorry, but we can't delay any more
- I interviewed a technician at Jülich.
He could've told the cops,
"Get Maiwald, he's in contact with hackers."
But I was careful.
They'll throw me out of the home.
I'm totally broke.
- We'll find a way, Karl.
- There's more to it than this.
- What?
Other hacks?
You do more serious hacks?
- Can't comment on that.
- No matter what was done,
you're better-off confessing.
If money's the problem,
I could set-up a news article.
I've got contacts at Stern.
They pay up to 50,000 DM for exclusives.
It'd be a new beginning.
You could make a fresh start.
- Sure.
- And then what?
- We'll go together.
- That's crazy.
- It's just an idea.
It could all be over.
- No it won't. It'd just begin!
You can't sell out to them!
- I can.
- Do it and our friendship ends.
- I've no parents to spoil me.
- Knock that shit off!
- Should I tell my parents, "Sorry, I made a mistake..." ?
- What if I talk to them?
- No.
- Enjoy your parents. I pity you.
- What will Lupo think?
He won't put up with it.
- Are you *joking*?
- Just look at yourself.
A screwed-up coke addict
a mental case.
But go ahead. Leave!
Here! Please!
But see a shrink or they won't believe you. Go on.
Get going!
- Hello.
- Can I help you?
- Can I talk to you outside?
- David paid us a visit...
You know what he said?
He said you're going to snitch. Is that true?
I want to know. Is it true?
- No.
- What about the journalist crap?
- I'm finished.
That's it. I want to turn myself in.
- How naive are you?
Do you really think I'd let you?
- If you tell anyone anything,
you're done for, Hagbard.
- Yes, and you are too!
- You damn rat bastard.
Listen... I was never involved...
No official residence, no documented border crossings...
You don't even know my name.
Pepe may get a few years, but they'll come down on you.
Just one call to the cops,
and that drug and spy shit will fall on you.
Just you.
- We could do a special program.
- It's an absolute exclusive.
Sell the TV rights to us and Stern the print rights.
- He must turn himself in.
We'll be implicated unless he confess.
Contact State Security.
They'll be very interested.
Tell them the whole truth
Give them names.
It'll improve your defense.
- Do you know about the new witness protection law?
It was passed for the RAF terrorists.
People who testify go free with a new identity.
You'll make a new start with a new name.
First, we'll do a killer prime time show.
It's good for you and good for me.
That's how it works with friends.
- Now I'll ask you some questions, Mr. Koch.
- Can I read a statement before we begin?
- Please, feel free.
We're not interrogating you,
We're only asking questions.
Read it.
I'm cooperating with State Security
even though it's a violation of hacker ethics.
After my accomplices' arrest,
I'll be able to sell my story.
- Keep reading; I'm listening.
- I can't start a new life without money.
I passed data and secrets
to avert threats of war,
but I failed.
Captain Hagbard Celine is gone, but Karl Koch may begin again.
[Somber classical music]
[Karl narrates:] "After two weeks interrogation, I couldn't go on.
I was burned-out and needed a break.
They confiscated things from my flat as evidence.
I found a place in the suburbs
and job as a council driver.
I was afraid I'd run into Lupo or Pepe
and sought to know if they'd been arrested.
I rang the TV station, but Weber wouldn't talk.
and they said Maiwald quit.
When it finally happened, it all felt surreal.
Weber sensationalized the story.
They named everyone.
I was never paid."
[TV:] "Minister of Domestic Affairs said,
'this was the biggest espionage case since the Guillaume scandal'"
[Karl writing:] "Dear David, When you read this, journalists will be covering me.
Whatever happens, our friendship was what meant the most to me.
Remember Hagbard Celine,
'Nothing is true, everything is permitted.' Yours, Karl."

[News stand Ad:] "Hanover computer spies caught. Weizsäcker re-elected."

[Indistinct whispering/voices]
[TV:] "Madam President, I accept the vote."
[TV:] "After a long procedure in Bonn, Richard von Weizsäcker...
It's no coincidence, he starts his term today
West Germany's basic law became law
on May 23, 1949, 40 years ago."
[Somber music]
[Text on screen:] "On may 23, Karl Koch didn't return from a trip
They found his burned body one week later.
The circumstances of his death are unknown.
Karl was 23."
[Text on screen:] "Six months later, the 'KGB spies' trial began.
The prosecution couldn't prove damages
to West Germany or the U.S."
[Text on screen:] "Lupo was sentenced to 14 months, Pepe to 24."
[Text on screen:] "Both sentences were suspended.
David's testimony for the prosecution gave him immunity.
He reported the KGB hacks in Stern
