Who is the best subject
to the King?
One who becomes
a great general
and conquers Liao Dong.
One who is skilled in martial arts
and protects the King.
One who is willing
to die for the King.
Under Yuan's subjugation,
the Goryeo King selected
young boys
and closely trained them to be
his royal guards called
the Kunryongwe.
He allowed these boys
to reside in the palace
and always kept them
within his reach.

Your Majesty.
The Princess from Yuan
has arrived at the port.
It is time to go meet
your Queen, Your Majesty.
The court subjects
are waiting, sire.
I haven't finished playing.
Wait outside.

Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Han-Baek!
You've gone mad over a girl!
How dare you run away!
Chief!
I beg of you.
Please let us go.
Strike me down first
if you must go.
I have no appetite.
Just one spoon, sire.
You must regain your strength.
That'll do, lad.
Just one spoon, please?
Why you...
There.
You may go.
Your Majesty?
Hmm?
Won't you please reconsider?
I won't hear any more
on this matter.
As the Chief, I'm partly
responsible for his actions.
If you must behead him,
punish me in the same regard.
I said, enough!
I beg of you, sire.
Chief.
Come in.
Brother!
Han-Baek!
Listen carefully.
The King has generously
spared Han-Baek's life.
However...
there will not be
a second chance.
Anyone who disgraces
the Kunryongwe's honor...
will pay with his life.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir!
What a relief.
Chief!
Very impressive, sir.
How did you manage
to free him?
He's one of us, we can't
abandon him for one mistake.
The law says to behead the foo
who messes with a court maid.
It's the King's command.
The King's command?
Why of course.
What?
Stop clouding the King's
judgment with pillow talk, sir.
Stop.
If you speak ill of
His Majesty again...
I'll have your head.
The honeysuckle tea
worked marvelously.
My fever has subsided
drastically.
It's a relief, sire.
I shall request another batch.
How did you know that
honeysuckle works on fevers?
My late father used to drink it
when he got colds.
I see.
What would you have done?
Sire?
If you were Han-Baek,
would you have left
the palace too?
You too have lived here
for over years.
Wouldn't you wanted to
run away from here?
How can I ever think of leaving
as you are here, sire.
Her Majesty, the Queen.
Have you slept well, sire?
Welcome, my Queen.
I brought some medicine
to bring down your fever, sire.
No need to bring it in person.
I shall leave in peace, sire.
My physician prepared this
specially for you, sire.
Thank you for your generosity.
I heard an envoy
from Yuan is coming.
Yes.
What more will they demand
on account of the royal heir issue?
It worries me so.
Worrying will not solve anything.
With all due respect, sire...
Perhaps you should make
more effort for an heir...
Shall I take in
another royal concubine?
You wanted to see me?
I heard you took care of
something I should've done.
Pardon?
My maid who was arrested for
running away with a guard.
I heard she's alive
thanks to you.
I wanted to thank you
for what you did.
No, Your Majesty.
I'm certain the King made
the decision with you in mind.
We both know that's not true.
However, remember this.
There's much clamor
over the royal heir issue.
Your service to the King can be
misunderstood at times like this.
So be careful.
The spring sun
is stunning, sire.
We should've come here earlier.
'Tis nice to be out
from the palace.
That sachet...
I haven't seen it in a while.
Oh, this?
Do you remember, sire?
You wore that
when you first came from Yuan.
It’s amazing that
it still carries its scent.
My Queen.
Would you care to sing?
Sire?
The Goryeo song you
always used to sing.
It’s so unexpected,
you’re making me blush.
What about you, Chief HONG?
Would you like to hear
the Queen sing?
Yes, Your Majesty.
See? He wants to hear it, too.
We'd be so obliged.
Oh, dear...
? Will you leave?
? Will you leave me?
? How will I live without you?
? If you leave me now?
? I wish to keep you from leaving.
? Will you not return
if I look sad?
? My love...
- You okay?
- Yes, sire!
Stop them!
Protect the King!
Escort the King!
- Bring me my sword!
- But, sire!
Bring it now!
Your Majesty!
Escort the Queen!
Your Majesty!
Hurry!
HONG Lim, HONG Lim!
Are you okay?
Yes, sire.
Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Sire!
Your Majesty!
How is he?
He is still unconscious, sir.
Only days until the Yuan
envoy arrives, this is a tragedy!
You!
How dare you sit here
with a straight face!
How did you allow this tragedy
to fall upon the King?
You still call yourself
the Chief of the Kunryongwe?
I will have you and others
personally responsible for this!
Chief HONG?
His Majesty is calling for you.
Are you okay?
Did you get your wound treated?
I deserve to die, sire.
My incapacity to fulfill my
duties brought you harm.
Please have me executed.
No, dear lad.
If you weren't there to save me,
I'd already be dead.
Your Majesty...
Chief...
Did you find out?
Just as we expected, sir.
Remember the raid
against the Japanese?
The Privy Council is claiming...
the remnants who escaped
are behind this.
What are the ministers saying?
What would the fools say?
They're all waiting on Lord CHO.
The court is filled
with scoundrels.
Perhaps we can ask the King
to put Lord CHO on trial?
Lord CHO is
under Yuan's protection.
We can't touch him
without proper proof.
Let's say that the Japanese
are behind this for now.
Act as usual and
obtain the evidence discreetly.
The Goryeo King shall
pay respects...
to the Yuan Emperor's demands!
Long live the Emperor.
Long live the Emperor.
A royal letter to my son-in-law,
the King of Goryeo.
The Father of Yuan
who unified the world...
knew well the will of Heaven...
and took in all nations
under him.
A century has passed...
in alliance with Goryeo
through matrimony.
Now, the Goryeo King
is without an heir...
The woes of the citizens...
are of my great concern.
Thus, I have decided to enthrone...
Lord Kyungwon as Crown Prince,
and stabilize the Goryeo court.
Also, to fight off barbarians...
who threaten Yuan...
dispatch, soldiers...
and, maidens...
in respects to thy father nation!
Sending soldiers and maidens
will not last long.
Yuan will make even more demands
using the heir issue as an excuse.
Hence, appointing Lord Kyungwon
as the Crown Prince quickly...
and stabilizing the court
is the most viable option, sire.
Any other thoughts?
I have something to say.
Are you the King's subjects?
Or Lord Kyungwon's subjects?
My lack of virtue
has left me without an heir.
However!
His Majesty is yet young.
But you ask to enthrone one
who is not of direct descent?
Tell him to give up the throne!
That's what you all really
want to say, is it not!
You've drunk much, sire.
I shall sleep here, tonight.
Return to Yuan.
As you may already know...
I am incapable of taking a woman.
Hence,
to get an heir is hopeless.
Eventually, everything will be
as Yuan wishes.
If Lord Kyungwon becomes
the Crown Prince...
I shall be a king only in name.
What glory would there be
at my side?
Before things get worse...
go back to your home country.
I am now a citizen of Goryeo.
How could I leave this palace
that I call home?
Then how much longer will you
endure this humiliation?
My Queen.
Yes?
We are not without options.
For the future,
it's the only way.
Your Majesty...
What are you saying, sire?
Who else can I trust but you?
I want you to serve the Queen.
No, sire!
I cannot do it.
Is Majesty has arrived.
Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock!
Go in.
Did you serve the Queen well?
Forgive me, sire.
You couldn't do it?
There are only two chances left.
So pull yourself together.
May I ask a question, sire?
You may.
Why did you choose me?
The child she'll have
must be as fair as you.
Midnight.
Midnight.
I will do it.
Morning, lad.
Have you slept well, sire?
Yes, indeed I have.
And you? How does it feel
to become a man?
What was it like to hold
a woman for the first time?
There is nothing to say, sire.
I served in accordance
to your orders.
I wish to visit Byuklan-do
for a few days.
Why?
I've been neglecting
my duties as the Chief.
I'd like to personally investigate
the attack, sire.
Not interested.
One of the biggest merchants
around suddenly disappeared.
He went out to meet
some noble person...
and was never seen after that.
Do you know where
merchant MA's family is?
I have something
to report, sire.
What is it?
A merchant who smuggled
Japanese weapons was found dead.
His name is MA Young-Gil.
It's possible that the perpetrators
killed him to cover their tracks.
Have you found any ministers
who are connected to him?
We are investigating, sire.
It could be the lead we need.
When did Chief HONG say
he'll be back?
He's running quite late.
Please go inside and rest, sire.
It's getting late.
What if something
happened to him?
Go check on him, Seung-Ki.
Yes, sire.
HONG Lim?
What brings you here, sire?
I was anxious.
What were you doing this late?
I was so worried something
had happened to you.
Is something the matter?
No, sir.
You must be going
through a lot.
Let's return to the palace
at daybreak.
Chief?
What's that you're hiding?
Shouldn’t you be preparing
for the banquet?
It's been cancelled, sir.
Why?
Just a moment ago His Majesty
went back to see the Queen.
- Why?
- She's said to be quite ill.
You have a high fever.
You must have exhausted
yourself during the ritual.
Wait.
It could be a sign of
morning sickness.
Perhaps you're pregnant?
Forgive me, sire.
Actually...
my menstruation started
a few days ago.
So you have not conceived?
No, sire.
There'll be a feast to pray
for the royal conception soon.
Keep this a secret for now.
Yes, sire. I'll arrange the
consummation date after the feast.
Honeysuckle tea
is good for fevers.
Make some for the Queen.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But drinking too much won't
make a difference, sire.
What do you mean?
Chief HONG took some
this afternoon.
Was it not meant
for the Queen, sire?
Where are you going?
Were you not asleep, sire?
No.
I have something to
finish up in my room.
The honeysuckle tea
you gave me earlier...
Yes?
It worked well on my cold.
Why don’t you send some
to the Queen?
I'm sure the court physician
will serve her well, sire.
You're right.
It wouldn't look good for you
to send her some.
You both went through
ha lot of trouble.
However, despite your efforts,
the result was inadequate.
A new date for consummation
has been set.
But...
I am reluctant this time.
It had a great toll
on the Queen's health.
I fear it could make things worse.
So let us postpone this
for a while.
What do you think, my Queen?
What could I say,
Your Majesty?
Do as you wish, sire.
What do you think, lad?
I shall do as you command.
I apologize for coming
without notice, Your Majesty.
No need.
What brings you here?
I heard you were sick and
came to check your condition.
Thank you for the honeysuckle tea
you sent through Bo-Duk.
Any court subject would
do the same.
Ah, here...
What's this?
It is a perfume sachet.
A sachet?
I heard during the attack...
you lost your treasured sachet.
I found a similar one during
my rounds outside the palace.
How very thoughtful.
It's nothing, madam.
I'll leave you to rest.
We, all your subjects
and your people pray for
you having a prince who can
succeed to the Royal line.
Long live the King!
We pray!
Tae-Ahn has become
almost Goryeo people.
He dances well.
Well...
How did you find your sachet?
My brother brought me
a similar one from Yuan.
I see.
Perhaps we shouldn't have
held this feast.
What if the Queen really
bears a child?
If such feasts had worked,
there would already be an heir.
Look at those concubines.
Even Buddha's grace won't
get them an heir.
But it's so quiet in palace.
Because His Majesty's
so concerned about heir.
In any case, we must enthrone
Lord Kyungwon at once.
Hence, we need
solid grounds to do so.
How about...
bringing in the Queens brother?
Lord Tae-Ahn?
Chief!
The flower cakes are delicious.
Try some.
No thanks.
All set to perform
the sword dance?
Yes, sir.
Let's go.
Chief HONG?
Ah...
- Welcome.
- Your Majesty.
May I offer up a drink,
Your Majesty?
I beg you for the first time.
Please.
I don't want to ruin
this enjoyable atmosphere.
Please rise and enjoy
the festivities.
Your Majesty.
Even the late King took pleasure
in singing and dancing at times.
Will you grace us a song?
This is for you.
What is it, Your Majesty?
It is a handkerchief
I embroidered myself.
I hope you
always keep it on you.
I'll be here again
at midnight, tomorrow.
? I went in to a shop
? to buy some flower cakes.
? A man grabbed my wrist.
? If word got out
? the young errand boy
? would have told.
? I shall go to sleep there, too.
? I shall go to sleep there, too.
? I went into a temple
? to light it.
? The temple owner
? grabbed my wrist.
? If word got out
? the temple,
? the young monk
? would have told.
? I shall go to sleep there, too.
? I shall go to sleep there, too.
Try tile fish from Jeju Island.
It's delectable.
I will get it myself, sire.
You don't eat
the good food on purpose.
Try it.
Yes, sire.
The new clothes suit you well.
Do you like it?
Yes, sire.
A delightful gift for you
shall be arriving tomorrow.
The Sub-Chief to see you, sire.
What brings you here?
I've come to
make a report, sire.
About what?
We found out who MA smuggled
weapons to before getting killed.
Who is it?
Minister KI Won-Hong's
steward, sire.
KI Won-Hong?
Lord Kyungwon wants a signed
covenant from the ministers.
That will surely change
the Emperor's mind.
We all support Lord Kyungwon.
But will we be enough?
Right under our noses.
Treacherous fiends!
Your nephew's birthday?
Of course you should go.
Thank you
for your permission, sire.
It would be splendid if you could
grace us with your presence.
How long will you be staying?
I dare not leave
the palace for long, sire.
Good morning, sir.
Cleanse your troubling thoughts
and rest easy at home.
Make preparations to go, then.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Thank you, sire.
I've come to report
on the tailing last night.
The Sub-Chief
has already informed me.
He said you left for
the palace earlier.
Why report to me so late?
Forgive me, sire.
I arrived very late.
I was afraid to wake you.
You've been in my chambers
for over years.
Since when did you
use formalities?
This is the horse?
Yes, Your Majesty.
She's a real beauty.
Chief HONG will be so pleased
to see her.
Please forgive me, but it may be
a better horse than your own.
Bring Chief HONG at once.
I want to see him ride it.
Where did Lord Tae-Ahn go
at this late hour?
It's not like the Queen
comes here every day.
I heard he's been
up to something as of late.
Chief HONG!
I apologize for startling you.
Leave us, Bo-Duk.
Yes, Your Majesty.
How did you...
I heard that chief Hong
went out at sunset.
Okay, leave.
Do you have something to say?
Offer me a drink, Your Majesty.
When will we ever get
to meet like this, again?
I'll pour you a drink
before you go.
Do you know
how much I despised you?
When I first came from Yuan...
I only had the King to depend on.
But he only had eyes for you.
It was only natural
that I resented you.
I made this myself.
Try it.
Flower rice cakes?
It's a Yuan custom to give
this to the one you love.
I've always wanted to make this
like other women.
Here, try it.
You don't like it?
No, Your Majesty.
It's exquisite.
Your Majesty.
Why do you only
favor chief Hong?
Am I not better than him?
What are you talking about?
I do favor you, too.
I want to serve
Your Majesty tonight.
They say 'The King is the land.'
Please allow me.
Leave.
What brings you here, sire?
Where have you been all night?
I asked you where you were.
I read a book on military tactics
in the library.
Which book was that?
'The Six Secret Strategies', sire.
Which among the six
did you find most amusing?
The politic and
the raid strategies, sire.
What was the raid strategy about?
What was it about?
It dealt with tactics
that can be used
when facing enemies on hills.
If you stayed up
reading on military tactics...
you must've practiced
your combat skills, too.
Bring your sword
to the Kunryong court.
Draw your sword!
I am yet no match for you, sire.
Winning is not the issue.
I want to test how you've refined
your skills as the Chief of guards.
Draw your sword!
Dare not go easy on me
because I am the King!
How will you cut down
the enemies like this?
The sword must move with soul,
not technique!
No use reading on
military tactics all night.
The problem is your heart.
You are
Chief of the Kunryongwe.
Show me true loyalty
from the heart.
Minister KI, Lord CHO, and others
are gathered at Wonheung Temple.
What?
I think there's something big
going down, sir.
Lord Tae-Ahn is there, too.
I'm very grateful
for all your help.
Especially,
Lord Tae-Ahn for his willingness
to join our cause.
When the Emperor sees this...
it will be of great help
to Lord Kyungwon.
Lord Tae-Ahn.
You've done much
for our country.
Who's there?
Get down from your horse.
- Run, sir.
- Okay.
Your Majesty.
What happened?
He confessed everything, sire.
The Lord Kyungwon's
secret envoy had this.
Everyone who signed here
plotted to kill me?
Yes, Your Majesty.
What of the Queen's brother?
Lord Tae-Ahn also conspired
to enthrone Lord Kyungwon.
There's not one man I can trust.
I'll have a banquet in few days.
And cut all of their heads there.
But I'll not let Tae-Ahn die in
the banquet because of Queen.
You're going to kill him
in his house.
All rise for His Majesty the King.
You may all be seated.
I've arranged this banquet today...
to celebrate the victory of
our troops dispatched to Yuan.
Though they are fighting for
a foreign country...
they stand bravely at the front,
showing the valor of our army.
Tis comforting somewhat.
Now.
Let us drink to
our soldier's safe return!
Hail, our gracious King!
Check your weapons.
And remember
who you're assigned to.
Lord CHO, how about telling
His Majesty a good sentence?
What a good day!
No, I think
Minister KI should do that.
Okay.
Your Majesty?
I, KI Wong-Hong...
would like to say something
on this euphoric day.
I wish you to bear an heir
and live a long life, sire.
Thank you.
I wish you a long life as well.
Hail, my gracious King.
Now, let us all toast
to the King!
Long live the King!
Stop the music!
Your attention!
With Goryeo's fall
as a tributary state to Yuan...
I've endured much humiliation
and disgrace.
I trust you all feel
the same as I do.
But, within this room...
there are some who take pride
in being puppets to Yuan.
As our young men are dying
in the savage land...
they believe
it should be celebrated.
Here today!
I shall rid of all such traitors!
And set the court right!
Kill them!
Kill off every one of them!
Out of my way!
Your Majesty... Please...
Listen carefully.
I just executed
a group of conspirators.
But Lord Tae-Ahn was
also among them.
Pardon?
Your brother...
He was among
the group of collaborators.
What are you saying, sire?
Lord Tae-Ahn...
Chief HONG went to
execute him, now.
Chief HONG!
I am the Queen's brother!
Though
I may have done wrong...
how can the King have me killed?
Take the King's orders in stride,
like a royal family.
Chief HONG!
Why would I have signed it?
It's because I was worried
about her future.
For the sake of the Queen...
Please do not kill me.
I did what you want me to do.
He accepted it?
Yes.
Good job.
What happened to my brother?
Answer me.
Did you really kill my brother
with your own hands?
Lord Tae-Ahn is alive.
What?
He and his family are
headed for Yuan now
Is that true?
Yes.
Cover it.
No need to bring me his head.
Forgive me, sire.
Chief HONG...
Did he truly let
Lord Tae-Ahn go?
I saw with my own eyes, sire.
I've asked you both here...
to discuss and conclude
our postponed matter.
Things have stabilized.
So, I'd like to resume
the consummation.
What do you think, my Queen?
Why all of a sudden, sire?
I'm resuming what was postponed.
Why be so surprised?
But, your partner
will not be HONG Lim this time.
It's Seung-Ki.
The result was not good
with HONG Lim.
Seung-Ki is also one of my
most trusted men.
I hope you understand.
Have you gone mad, sir?
How can you humiliate me so?
This cannot be, Your Majesty.
Why are you doing this, sire?
HONG Lim...
Do you really not know why
I made such decision?
It's a royal order.
I will set
the consummation date soon.
Who is it?
Let's leave the palace.
Anywhere,
if we can leave the palace.
Let's run away from here!
Please calm down, Your Majesty.
Where do you want to go?
Yuan? Hide in the hills?
III follow you anywhere.
Take me away from here, please.
Please go back.
If he finds out you're here,
your life will be in danger.
It doesn't matter.
I have nothing more
to be afraid of now.
But, I am afraid.
Do not come for me again.
I will live only as
the King's subject from now on.
Your Majesty.
I deserve to die.
I was blinded by foolish desires
and betrayed and humiliated you.
This is the very sword
you granted me.
Please take my life with it.
I shall seek your forgiveness
in death.
You've given away something
more precious than life.
What good would it do
to take your life, now?
Has Chief HONG
retired to his room?
He is still
in the back garden, sire.
Luckily, she will be fine.
No need to worry, Your Majesty.
I will ask you just one thing.
Your liaisons with the Queen...
Was it all impulsive lust?
Yes.
Your Majesty.
Go serve at the border
in a few weeks.
It will help you forget about
everything here.
You didn't sleep all night.
Stay and rest.
Your tunes
have become rather dull.
Do it again.
Do you know where this is?
Where is it, sire?
I dreamt of hunting through
the Liao Dong plains with you.
It was so vivid,
I wanted to paint it.
Then that is me riding behind?
Why? Do you not like it?
Perhaps it would be better...
if I was shooting an arrow, too.
Now that you mention it,
that'll suit better...
Are you leaving tomorrow?
Yes, sire.
Our soldiers dispatched to Yuan
will be returning in two weeks.
I will hold a big banquet.
Why don't you leave
after that?
No, sire.
I will leave as scheduled.
Who is it?
Chief HONG?
It's me Bo-Duk.
What is it?
I have something urgent to tell you.
Go back.
I'm so sorry. Chief Hong.
I said Go back.
The Queen wants to see you.
I don't want to.
Please, just one time.
Please.
I cannot see her.
Just go.
But Chief...
The Queen has conceived.
It's been a long time.
I'm so sorry.
I was troubled whether to tell you
just before your departure.
Does His Majesty know?
I haven't told him yet.
I doubt he'll welcome
this child, now.
I fear it will
only harm the child.
No, Your Majesty.
The King will truly accept
the child as his own.
Please keep strong.
I shall be going, then.
HONG Lim.
Secretary HWANG?
Yes, Your Majesty?
Where are
the military tactic books stored?
You!
How could you humiliate
me like this!
And you call yourself a man!
What did you promise me?
You said you'll never
meet her again!
But...
How can you do this to me!
Queen.
What should I do with him?
That lewd fool!
What shall I do with him?
Say something!
'Tis all my fault, sire.
My affections for him
led me to seduce him.
Punish me instead, sire.
No, Your Majesty!
The Queen is without fault!
I sought her,
unable to fight my love for her.
Take my life, sire.
What?
Did I hear love?
Did you... say
you love the Queen?
Yes.
I love her.
Say it again.
Did you just say
you're in love with the Queen?
Yes.
I love the Queen.
You've gone mad with lust!
Sub-Chief!
Yes, Your Majesty.
Have him castrated!
But sire...
Cut it off at once!
Your Majesty...
What are you waiting for!
Cut it off!
Please, Your Majesty!
Kill me, Your Majesty!
Kill me, Your Majesty!
Forgive him, sire!
I'll never meet him again.
Just kill me instead!
Forgive him, please!
It'll never happen again!
Your Majesty!
No! No!
Your Majesty!
- I'd rather die, sire!
- Forgive me, sire!
Kill me instead!
Castrate him now!
Sire!
Please don't!
Sire!
No, Your Majesty!
Sire!
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty.
I have an urgent matter
to inform you.
What is it?
Your Majesty...
Congratulations, sir.
The Queen
has finally conceived!
The long awaited heir
has finally come.
What a blessing
for the royal family, sire.
I need you to do something.
Yes, Your Majesty.
The Queen has conceived a child.
Sire?
You know very well
whose child it is.
For that child to become
truly mine...
What should be done?
When the night falls...
eliminate everyone involved.
Yes, Your Majesty.
But, what about chief Hong?
Now we're same.
Who would find you,
if I'm don't.
I suggest a simple thing.
Let's get back to the first place.
If you come back,
I'll give you everything.
Even this country.
I must save Chief HONG.
Do you know why the King
summoned me earlier?
He said he'll accept
this child as his.
How can there be two fathers?
The moment this child
becomes the royal heir...
everyone who
knows of this will die.
Quickly, take this to Han-Baek.
And follow Chief HONG to
Eunjung Temple.
But, Your Majesty...
if the King accepts
this child as his...
will you not be safe?
Why bring calamity upon yourself?
There is no time.
Go, now!
Your Majesty...
No! Please!
Chief!
Chief!
Chief...
Let's get out of here.
Wear this.
How did you come here?
The Queen told us.
What?
We have to get out of here first.
Hurry up.
The Queen?
What are you talking about?
Please stand up.
We don't have time.
How's she?
How is the Queen?
The Queen went out of palace.
Forgive me, sire.
Chief!
Are you okay, sir?
Hurry! Take him inside.
Where is the Queen?
What?
Where is the Queen?
The Queen?
Didn't you bring her with you?
What are you saying, sir?
The Queen is not here, Chief.
What?
Forgive us.
We lied to you.
Here is HONG Lim?
I do not know, sire.
Don't you want your child
to see the light of day?
Tell me where HONG Lim is.
I do not know.
Take my life if you must, sire.
I can't let you die so easily.
If you give a birth,
I'll raise him as a son of
whom did high treason.
You should see that.
Talk to me.
I don't know.
I'm sorry.
I just want to hear from you.
Let's go.
Let me go.
- Come on!
- What are you doing?
- Let her go!
- Your Majesty!
How dare you!
What are you doing, Chief?
Please listen to me.
- Chief
- Where are you going, sir!
- Chief!
- Chief!
Out of my way!
It's what the Queen wanted!
Don't do this!
Out of my way!
Do you really think
you can save her?
I came here because of you, sir.
Please get off the horse.
Out of my way, now!
If you must, then go.
But...
What will you do
after bringing her here?
All is lost.
What can you do for her?
Do you think
you can make her happy?
- Chief!
- Chief!
Where is HONG Lim?
Where is HONG Lim?
How much more
do you think you can endure?
Tell me where he is!
He already left.
Why are you doing this?
How dare you!
Heads on stakes!
There are heads on stakes!
Today...
in recognition of
our dispatched soldiers to Yuan...
I have arranged this banquet.
I will see to our soldiers
fighting for Goryeo alone.
I want all of you
to mark this occasion.
Drink to your hearts' content
and enjoy!
Long live the King!
You look exhausted, sire.
Please retire to your chambers.
Do you really think
Chief HONG will come?
Your Majesty.
Please take down the heads
hanging over the castle wall.
'Tis not a matter of your concern.
Now, go.
Everything happened
as you wanted, sire!
So, please let Chief HONG go.
Sub-Chief?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Escort the Queen
to her chambers.
Yes, sire.
I shall leave in you peace.
You're the only one left, now.
Pardon?
Everyone involved has died.
You are the only one left.
What do you mean, madam?
You know perfectly why
Han-Baek and Bo-Duk were slain.
Eventually, you will be silenced
in secrecy, too.
There is no one else who can
stop His Majesty's madness.
Release him from
his pains soon.
I am the Princess of Yuan.
If Lord Kyungwon succeeds
to the throne...
I shall at least
guarantee your life.
Out of my way.
I came to see the King.
Why'd you come here?
You're wanted for high treason.
Let me through.
We can't, sir.
Please leave
before anyone sees you.
I do not wish to strike you.
Out of my way.
No, sir!
Chief, Han-Baek, and the others
were not traitors?
If what you say is true,
it affects us, too.
But why are you
telling us this, now?
If I hadn't kept it
a secret till now...
do you think you'd be alive?
Chief HONG!
Sir!
Chief HONG has returned!
What?
He's engaging the guard
at the court!
Where have you been?
You've been through a lot
haven't you?
Why are you standing there?
Come and sit by me.
I came to take your life, sire.
Pick up your sword, sire.
It is my final show of respect.
Why did you do it, sire?
How can you do that
to the Queen?
Pick up your sword, sire!
You fool.
Shall I strike first, sire?
Stand up, Your Majesty.
Fine.
If killing me
will ease your anger...
then try and kill me!
Do you really think
you can beat me?
I've been cut to my roots.
There is nothing left
for me to fear.
You castrated fool!
Was love so important?
You led me to feel love.
I couldn't be more grateful!
- Your Majesty!
- Stay back!
Anyone who intervenes
will be the first to die!
Sire!
Nobody moves until I say so!
I will give you one last chance.
Drop your sword and surrender.
Then I shall spare your life.
It is too late, sire.
Finish me, sire.
Fine.
I'll kill you.
What is going on?
You cannot enter, Your Majesty.
Please go back.
Let me ask you one thing.
Have you, at least once...
felt love for me?
Have you...
even once...
thought me to be your love?
No, sire.
Not even once!
Not yet!
- Your Majesty!
- No!
Out of my way!
HONG Lim!
HONG Lim!
Escort the Queen
to her chambers!
HONG Lim!
Let go of me!
HONG Lim!
Take her, now!
How dare you!
Let go of me!
HONG Lim! HONG Lim!
The King has just passed away
in the hands of an assassin.
And we killed the assailant.
Quickly move the bodies...
and make sure
none of this gets out.
Yes, sir.
The palace looks really great
up here.
Really?
Do you know
where the court is?
The court is your home, right?
Where is it?
My home?
My home is right there.
What do you think?
It's great.
I would love to live there.
Then how about living together
in our entire life?
Yes, Sire!
