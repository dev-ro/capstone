<I> in the clutches of time that the roses wither ... </ i>
<I> of passionate lips and countries. </ I>
<I> And the threats of the time she has no fear. </ I>
He exists.
Amazingly, Paul. Thank you. - I knew you'd like it.
<I> But if I am wrong and lie my verse, </ i>
<I> then there is no love and no verse. </ I>
That was all. Pen calling me.
I bet you wrote "Romeo and Juliet".
Wear a cloak of a member of the Lodge.
This is the Comte de Saint-Germain.
And him?
In 1669 lived the first time traveler.
Lancelot December Vilars.
Your mind is clouded. God help you.
Do you really believe in his omnipotence?
His senses are. How dare you change the laws of time?
And to use our gift to future changing in their favor?
Our duty is to manage the future for the benefit of all.
I will destroy your devilish time machine.
You want to put the world on your knees and be greater than the Lord.
My world order means much more.
Do not!
More than your life, my dear praroditelyu.

<I> In the course of many centuries gene travelers in time </ i>
<I> passed through the generations December Vilars and Mantrouz. </ I>
<I> As suddenly becomes known that I, Gwendolyn Shepherd, </ i>
<I> Miss "Misunderstanding", ridiculed, walking chaos and black sheep, </ i>
<I> I just inherited this gene. </ I>
<I> For this reason, you should regularly travel time </ i>
<I> using the chronograph. </ I>
<I> Without it travels become spontaneously and can be very dangerous. </ I>
Help!
Now you will understand what we do with people like you.
<I> Everything depends on the "Lodge of the Guardians" because they kept chronograph. </ I>
<I> And now I. </ I>
<I> In the beginning everyone thought that the gene is inherited from my </ i>
<I> super-buper cousin, Charlotte. </ I>
Charlotte!
<I> Unfortunately, ruby ​​I found myself. </ I>
Judging by all, Gwendolyn will become the new ... Charlotte.
Kidding, right?
<I> Gideon December Vilars is diamond. </ I>
<I> Lodge and Charlotte preparing him for many years. </ I>
Stay away from Gideon! Do you understand?
<I> All around me as loser. </ I>
Gwendolyn has a brain like a pea and two left feet.
<I> So no one deigned to explain to me what's going on. </ I>
<I> For example, this heinous type, Count Saint-Germain. </ I>
<I> Also a time traveler. </ I>
<I> It is something as head of the lodge, although living in the 18th century. </ I>
<I> I do not believe this nasty old man. </ I>
I will not tolerate someone violates my right?
<I> He commanded guardians to collect blood from all travelers. </ I>
<I> Previous traveler family was my cousin Lucy, </ i>
<I> but has gone against the Lodge and was forced to flee in the past. </ I>
<I> stole the chronograph is to prevent the closure of the "Circle of Blood". </ I>
Surrender!
<I> But the Lodge was another chronograph and is now trying to "circle". </ I>
<I> remains the most important issue. Why Lucy has decided to run? </ I>
<I> And what is my role in all this? </ I>
<B>  "Diary. 1912." </ B> </ i>
Gideon? Yes, listen.
On 30th October 1912
Lady occipital played golf in Hyde Park with their relatives.
Must have been Paul and Lucy.
No, we must meet them. When will you?
Miss Gwendolyn, have no such right.
What are you doing here? - The answers to thousands of questions ...
Mr. George, still need your help.
Should run into 1912.
Who were you talking about? - Me?
<I> With no one. I only have access to the archives ... </ i>
Rather, it will change.
<I> Mr. George is an old friend of my grandfather </ i>
<I> and is the only person who I believe. </ I>
Miss Gwendolyn, do not look at me like that.
You know perfectly well that I was forbidden to help you.
Well, are you ready?
<B>  Hyde Park in 1912. </ B> </ i>
<I> Gideon is my partner in travel. Walking encyclopedia, </ i>
<I> connoisseur of good manners, martial arts. </ I>
<I> And on top of that damn sexy. </ I>
I'd thrown it.
Which idiot decided ladies riding side?
This is madness. - Your ignorance
and ignorance of the label does not give you the right to express that.
You got a problem? - No, you remember the proviso?
Ask 3 questions and without tricks. - And disappear in your order, remember.
On the other side we are. The bridge is not yet built.
And now what? - Bypass. In the gallop.
What?
Why steal the chronograph? - We had reasons. Will soon find out.
Unlike you, I will sacrifice everything ...
in the name of our goal. - Too bad you believe in these tales.
Paul, hello.
Lucy ...
Lady occipital. - Hello.
I hope in the lodge to behave well with you.
Do not be angry at these old and petty snobs.
Is it true that golf will become popular? Or to play tennis? Or rugby?
No, do not leave golf. After three years you will be the first woman
won the FA Cup. - In golf you ?! Great!
The remaining 10 minutes. - Yes.
Why steal a time machine and ...
run away with it. - To protect you.
But from what?
When the blood of all be in chronograph
will be established great power. With your blood Circle will be closed.
Your life is in danger. Be careful.
And that's it? How do you know this?
Why worry so Gwen, you're willing to risk your life?
You do not even know.
Gwendolyn, you ... - You're special.
There are many signs of ancient prophecies and manuscripts.
Travel time to contact all.
All right. Let's go. - Wait.
Where is the chronograph, who stole in our time?
We hid it in a safe place. - Find Green Rider.
He will bring with him. - Who?
Ask your grandfather.
Gwendolyn.
Find out who can be trusted and who - no.
Gwen time.
Farewell, dear.
Gideon should find this chronograph.
If we have our own selves we can travel in time
without dependent Lodge. - I do not believe Paul and Lucy. They lie to us.
Why should they? - The idea of ​​a new world order
is so revolutionary that people are frightened.
Afraid of change. Remember the great scientists
prophets like Galileo, Darwin, Da Vinci ...
Lodge is just a gathering of arrogant misanthrope,
who think they are elected. It's just ... what?
Nothing.
Young people, it is a church. You can not kiss.
So ... hey! Phew, what a shit!
Can not you stop drooling?
Who are you? Leave us!
You want to leave you?
What is it? - No ... I do not ...
Roof you run?
Nightmare! Now will undress you?
Our shame, our eyes!
Beat it! - What?
Do you see me?
Finally someone saw Himerius!
How wonderful! Let's play.
Come on, please.
I think we should go back to the lodge. - Or ...
to take one day off?
Again, you dirty thoughts, Mr. December Vilars?
No, I just want to be with you.
Hey! Young lady! Wait!
Do not leave so!
You're the first one can see me ...
since the Middle Ages!
<I> Today there meeting of the inner circle of the lodge. </ I>
<I> It happens rarely and only for a special occasion. </ I>
I never attended, but I know
<I> that there are Nobel Prize winners, scientists, politicians and religious leaders. </ I>
<I> There are also members of the royal family. </ I>
Why was not I told? I have questions to these gentlemen.
It is forbidden for women. This is the rule for 300 years.
I doubt it ever be repealed. - What discussion?
All men. Money, power, which is the most beautiful car.
Or what a strange person I am. - Yes?
Well, I will deliver.
You should see a elapsatsiya. Will accompany Mr. Whitman.
No, why him? - Because recently became known,
that are violations. I'll take care of rubincheto.
Wonder.
We have a new security system and now will always be under surveillance.
Surprise! Again I am.
Say you are happy to see me.
For such an influential organization is ridiculous to fear me.
Who said that fear?
Should you trust us.
In your place I would never believe this Galfond.
Fly.
Time. Yes, young lady. Will not get rid of me so easily.
I come from an ancient race of powerful demons.
Look ... I'd go to the bathroom. Start without me.
Gadnichko. In the bathroom? Sounds disgusting.
There.
So ... Now listen to me.
That they see does not mean to drag after me and tease me.
So get out. - Please? It is a miracle to see me.
I must have you, that is the law of gargoyles.
I have so much work, I can not think of a mad ghost.
I'm not crazy ghost. I am powerful and gargoyle demon
called in the 11th century and unfortunately doomed to wander
the earth. - Ever?
This is probably longer. - Please. Let's be friends.
You will see that I am very cool, charming and with a sense of humor.
And I can scare. I know many secrets
and I am very, very smart.
What else expected of Himerius?
Honestly, it's better not they've ever seen.
One more question ... Miss "Responsibility".
What is this place? - Headquarters of the lodge.
Here control the routes of travel time
in secrecy. - Time travelers?
Can more detail? - I understand only half
of this mysterious stupidity. - So you must Himerius.
Together we razdiplim mysterious stupidity.
I'll be your secret weapon. - Okay.
But I forbid you to appear when kissing.
And pull me, tease and ... whenever we are not alone,
must be invisible.
<I> Gwendolyn's time. </ I>
Well, it is. I agree. Will you buy me a kitten?
No. - No?
No. - Please.
Today better not elapsiram. I do not even dizzy.
Do you think you know more than me? I'm sure a few hours
in a dark and cold room will do you good.
One hour is enough.
Poor.
You're too good, Mr. George.
I would be hard however. Two and a half hours. Even better - 3.
What are these halves?
Date of appointment is September 12, 1953.
Are you ready, Miss Gwendolyn?
<B>  in 1953. </ B> </ i>
Damn! - Sorry, I did not.
How did you get here? Let me help you.
Careful, you fainted? - No.
Who are you? - Gwendolyn Shepherd. Rubin. And you?
Rubin? Bray.
I'm Lucas Mantrouz, ma'am. Usually there is no one here.
Say something. Are you okay? - Father Lucas?
Now will bring ice. - No, wait.
You are my grandfather. Really.
Sing "God Save the Queen" in the shower and eat breakfast in your pajamas.
I will not even have children and a woman.
Will have children. Three.
However cow Aunt Glenda ... - Stay, do not want to know.
You Rubin.
You really ... - I gene travelers.
How old are you? - 34.
Just accepted me in the box, and I Can grandfather.
I have a granddaughter, a time traveler.
Tell me a good grandfather you will be? - The best.
Very loved.
So I'm already dead.
All right. - Unfortunately.
William.
William December Vilars, it is an honor for me.
What brings you to London?
Statute of the lodge was repeatedly and deliberately violated.
Where are Falk and Dr. White.
You could say that at this point decide other tasks.
Irresponsible behavior you leave us no choice.
Life of Rubin was unduly jeopardized.
Here you all go crazy since Gwen join us?
It is not your job to judge about it.
Yes, but I'm the one who has to risk his life for the cause.
Allow to see personally column and to clarify what is the mission of Rubin.
Please keep order.
Nothing is able to stop us.
Revival of the eagle will make us more powerful than we imagine.
But each of us is obliged to prove that he is worthy of it.
From that point depends eternity!
From that point depends eternity!
Three children and seven grandchildren?
Are they insured? You might need money or ...
some help? - What? Why?
I just ...
Oh, that? No. Fashion is just one.
Interesting. So you Rubin, right?
And this Diamond like December Vilars?
Is he arrogant twerp like all his ancestors?
Gideon December Vilars?
Yes. Sometimes puffs up, but not as bad as others.
It is quite nice and kind ... actually ... he's my boyfriend.
And you do not know very young ... for such work?
On the contrary. I am behind my classmates,
they already had ...
Wait. I did not talk to you about ...
... Sex. I will not talk about sex.
Do not say that word to me.
And how do you call it?
I do not want to discuss it. Or at least not with young girls.
Power makes you confident and you become too emotional.
You can not they upreknem it. Do you ever feel emotions?
Gideon, now is not about that. We put you in such knowledge,
skills and habits required to sacrifice their emotions.
I see that Rubin affects you badly.
It only teaches me to doubt it. - Nonsense. Sets out our plans at risk.
We are the elite, Gideon. You have not forgotten it?
How do you know who I am?
You have to go back in the ranks. - The boy has a bad company.
Cried in London his brother Rafael.
It will be a little Gideon ... relaxed.
Lucy asked me to ask you about the Green Rider.
Will help you find the chronograph. - Green Rider. I do not know.
It may be a book or picture. Will enroll.
You know what happens when Circle of Blood close?
In a prophecy speaks of the rebirth of the eagle.
Victory over disease and death.
That is a good thing? - Yes, it is worth fighting for.
And to die?
Lucy said that is related to my death.
What? No, on the contrary.
Immortality, justice, freedom and enlightenment.
This is the beginning of a new era.
Time to go.
Moment, you'll meet again! Here ... or in my office.
On the second floor. The key ... will leave it here. And plan ...
how to get to my office. There, in a grandfather clock.
Lying here naked.
<I> In bed you? </ I>
I'm all alone. - It will not be for long.
Even Mr. Bern to let you,
will not pass unnoticed by my mom, aunt and grandmother.
Good evening.
Beguiled me here with empty promises, ma'am.
All right.
Is there any news?
No.
And you? How is the inner circle?
Whose car is the coolest? - Apparently William December Vilars.
William December Vilars? This another uncle you?
Yes. Lives in Singapore and monitor the state of the Lodge of the global financial market.
One of the most wealthy and influential people, and my godfather.
After the death of my father sends me money
but until now I had not seen.
Great family you have.
Yeah.
Mom moved to France when I was 12 years old.
She lives with my brother and his new man.
And I stayed with Folk.
Stay. Your mother has left 12 here in London?
In Lodge? You must be very lonely.
Sometimes.
Will you regret it?
Lodge is my family.
They know me best. - Do not say that.
I know you best.
Not so easy to get rid of me.
I promise you.
Gwen, what's going on here?
Mom!
Could not you knock?
You can not rushing into my personal space.
Insanely glad to see you.
Go. Goodbye. - Goodbye.
Hey! And I was once young and I can understand.
Gwendolyn. Just do not want to believe him more than myself.
<I> Diamond ... </ i>
<I> so cold ... </ i>
<I> A ruby ​​is so bright ... </ i>
<I> The Lion stalking ... </ i>
<I> and is approaching closer and closer ... </ i>
<I> His eyes are green ... </ i>
Gwendolyn! Heart!
Aunt Maddie!
Aunt Maddie, what are you doing here ?!
Ruby heart ...
Lion breaks it down with his paw ... Thus!
What? - And ... it sprayed into pieces!
But these are not small pieces, these are drops of blood!
What does all this mean? - My baby!
Keep your heart. It is in danger.
Will go down with me in the kitchen?
Suddenly I really feel like eating chocolate cake.
According to me, they warned for Gideon.
According to the symbolism of the Lodge, it is the lion,
and heart ... - will shatter.
Did you do it?
That takes time and place.
And we can not find them, because we are carriers of this gene stupid.
Charlotte Mantrouz, my angel!
Lodge needs you more than ever.
Because Gwen is poorly prepared and incompetent you?
Green Rider will lead us nowhere.
There is such a book, but can not find it.
<B>  in 1783. </ B> </ i>
Gideon December Vilars.
After recent events we have to keep maximum secrecy.
What happened? - The Florence Alliance.
Column attacked and stole his memoirs.
Important secret documents fell into the hands of our enemies.
My dear descendant. 100 years trying to deliver
these pathetic misguided soul,
but they nevertheless are multiplying like rats.
Thank you. - I am an experienced warrior.
There is nothing to worry about. Everything is under control.
What brings you here? - Do not give me rest a question.
What is the role of Rubin?
Why predict her death?
Lodge members are very confused.
Gwendolyn bother. - Perfect for no reason.
Rubies should serve me and our common goals.
All carriers of the gene.
I would be very surprised if you let this girl back to you.
Should have dozens of lovers.
These romantic fantasies are female weaknesses
to use for your goals.
Attractive young man like you, no work will Devic won hearts.
Manipulation of feelings is high art.
Next time come both ...
taking the Lord Brompton.
With all due respect, Count, Gwen was not ready for such events.
It will cause attention and cause a scandal.
This is not a request but an order. Women love receptions.
Time to show the world our Rubin. Turn her head.
Temptations January ... and she herself will crawl to us.
Mind you.
So what? Ready?
If you are ready.
Special dinner for higher circles of the London aristocracy.
On site you will receive instructions from the column.
In 1783 column about entangled intrigue.
So if Florentine Alliance suspicious, danger lurks.
Perhaps Gwendolyn must remain?
Will prepare thoroughly for this mission.
Her life will be in danger if we listen.
It insanely was relieved.
I'll explain it in simple terms.
Lodge kindly asked me to prepare.
Dear Charlotte, help us.
Gwendolyn can not do without your help.
Are you ready for your first lesson?
Label, secular discourse, history and polite addresses.
Are you impressed? - Let's start with something simple.
For example, what is ridikyul?
Ridikyul ...
Well ... ridikyulat is ... something ...
something ...
Himerius.
Is this your answer?
What? No, it's ...
Ridikyulat is ...
<I> This is ... this bag. </ I>
Such small.
This is a bag, such a small.
Packed with all girly works wipes ...
Salts breathing ...
Packed with all things girly.
I like many ridikyula.
The addresses are: Your Highness,
Your Majesty and Your Highness.
To take a break, otherwise I'll melt your brain.
Very funny, Gwen.
With your stupid numbers risking not only their lives,
but the life of Gideon. I want ...
What? What do you have? - We're friends, Gwendolyn?
We have a healthy relationship.
Share the values ​​and fight for the same goals.
But do not think you got it.
Vacuum cleaner, cappuccino, exercise bike, chopper,
transplant, anti-age cream, cell phone,
bus zipper. What unites these words?
Answer: "These things do not exist in the 18th century."
Should be excluded from your dictionary.
And all - YOLO, cool, OMG, UK and ...
Lobotomy?
<I> And seven, eight ... </ i>
<I> Do not forget the conversion. </ I>
Left hand side, but turn to the left.
Oh, Gwen Come on. Where is the left?
In fine, please.
Do not forget to smile.
Head lifted.
Hands at chest level and gracefully ...
Windmills move more gracefully.
Miss Shepherd, today look like a road cone.
Rather dancing cone Mr. December Vilars.
Charlotte. Come.
To give road cone small lesson.
Yes, they know what they do.
All of them receive with ease and naturally.
How elegant. Lovely.
Just look, my dear. This is called true harmony.
Unfortunately, I can not afford a full day to enjoy
Mr. and Miss "Harmony". I have found in the past.
So I'll see you later.
Gideon does not walk you to elapsatsiya?
He has already succeeded in the morning to go to the 18th century and visit the big boss.
He was in the box? - Do not load the delicate little head.
And just try tomorrow you fail.
<B>  in 1950. </ B> </ i>
What?
What are you doing here? - You went to a meeting in the past?
Mr. Whitman convinced that we need to teach more.
French manners.
Dancing.
Why did not you say you were at it?
What are you talking to me? - Come on, please.
Is not important. Not necessarily know everything.
Listen. So tired of the secrecy that surrounds us.
I wish I could believe you. - And believe me and not make a scene.
Can I invite you to dance?
So my cousin Charlotte not meet the needs of you dancing?
No, Miss Shepherd. Your cousin can not satisfy neither my need.
And on my second cousin?
Lady in green. Cousin sofa.
In her arms you can relax completely.
Yes, but I have already had my eye on you.
Time.
The orchestra still set.
Reverence.
I knew you would do.
Right hand over your right shoulder.
Left over the left shoulder.
Not bad.
Yes, truly graceful mill. - Easily will replace any mill.
Dance no worse than Charlotte.
Yes, of course. She is Miss "Perfection".
Tell me, how well do you know?
The gentleman does not discuss these topics with their lady.
Complete moron!
See? This is the difference between you and Charlotte.
It would not do so.
Probably not ... just gave her the occasion.
Yes, or ...
she was raised in another way.
Oh, no.
Are you all right, Miss Gwendolyn?
Good evening. - There must have been a very hot?
Yes, hot summer of '50.
I feel I still have kissed there.
Or you have played in the hay.
In the hay? No, I left my books there.
A lot of things I have seen in my life and I know for sure,
looks like a girl coming from the hay.
Embarrassed you, Miss Shepherd? I hope that you do not have serious damage.
Wait, what happened? - My brother has arrived.
Expelled him from another school. - So was good.
Surely you brothers? - Until recently, Gwen.
<I> Until recently, Gwen. </ I>
Is it more carefully?
<I> Maybe you should not play with it hay. </ I>
<I> Now that you know your available and will no longer fight for you. </ I>
Shut up.
How are you, man? - And you, Mr. "Blue Blood"?
I missed you.
You know its normal to occur in this type here?
You've changed. Probably because of that girl.
Do not dictate a new fashion?
The last time they ask. Why tamper with the act of Gwendolyn?
I would never have entrusted the fate of his daughter like you.
Not accept it, Grace. Her lack of preparation threatens her life.
I had reasons and none of your business. - You can not just leave you.
Gwendolyn! Why are you alone? - Gideon had a job.
Let's get out of here.
<I> "Birth". </ I>
Find midwife who signed it and get her to talk.
How do you feel? You made you dinner?
No, thanks.
Something's wrong, honey?
All burn, do you have a temperature? - Mom, I can not understand.
Why no one has to know the date of my birth?
I feel a fool. - I want to be strong,
to believe in their feelings, not dogmas of the lodge.
What if the Lodge really has good intentions and worth
to fight for the box? His grandfather believed. - Lucy said to trust only themselves.
But what did she mean? - How should I know? You ask her.
Mom, Lucy lives in the last century, and I in this. How to ask her?
What hefty sofa.
Do not call her first, so enter only nincompoops.
I called my mom to tell her that you come alive.
And that elder brother teach you manners.
<I> In the past you? </ I>
Candles dancing. How romantic.
Was unforgettable, but I do not know. On the one hand dunce.
Constantly lying to me, flirting with Charlotte.
But I want more than that.
Has not called me. What if he decided it was terrible?
Or ... - Now the most important thing is he to call you.
Do not even think to call first. - A message?
In any case. It is important to him harassed.
Such is the nature of men. They are by nature hunters.
Sorry, I'll call you later.
Come in.
Remembering your request, took advantage of his position,
organized a search and found. - What?
Were you looking for this? - Green Rider.
This book belonged to your grandfather. - Thanks, helped me a lot.
Whenever you want, Miss Gwendolyn. Whenever you want.
Where there is more caffeine? In coffee, tea or energy drinks?
All night trying to figure out what these figures mean.
May mean letters? Letters.
Gwen, of course, this is a cipher.
Super.
Rafael will complete the school year with us.
With him are old friends. Come on.
You'll never guess whose brother is.
Interested in Me? - Another December Vilars.
Have today met with his grandfather, would know the meaning of these figures.
And then we ...
Hello ... talking crazy traveler. Echo!
These December Vilars have great genes.
Why do not you call me?
<I> You have no new messages. All messages ... </ i>
Gideon! - William.
We know that Margaret occipital going to church every Sunday.
We assume that there will be Lucy and Paul. Know what to do.
Yes. - Probably will try to take your blood
to close the circle of blood in stolen chronograph.
Never let it.
<B>  in 1912. </ B> </ i>
You are here? Alone?
Gwen. Gwen!
Do not believe him, it's a trap! He wants your blood!
Who attacked?
Do you have any suggestions? - No.
I told you, hit me on the head.
At least no signs of nicks, you do not have your blood taken.
Can not believe nobody.
Nobody.
Off your one pound, my dear grinders.
You're not wasting grief? - My emotions are like a roller coaster.
I ... - Oh, my sweetie.
But did you take precautions? Everything is ...
Equipped and ready for everything?
My sweetie, I see that flagging this rascal.
Already went through this with your cousin Lucy.
And they were totally unprepared. - Lucy and Paul?
Here were all outraged by the intrigue between Mantrouz or de Vilars.
But when the two were conquered by love, have the feeling that will conquer the mountains,
therefore lodge could not stop them.
And this young man you will find yourself in trouble if you understand you.
Clearly that, but you will not ... - I know?
No, I can not keep my mouth shut. You've seamstress.
Excuse me, but emerged certain circumstances.
Gideon was attacked in 1912. - What?
What happened? How is he? I have to see ....
He is in safe hands, believe me.
But why can not I just see it? - Miss Gwendolyn, for no secret,
that common sense leaves us when we are in love.
Namely common sense you need now.
All right. Mr. George,
Can I now go back to 1953?
Yesterday I had an important meeting there. - Interesting.
We could convince Mr. Whitman, without unnecessary suspicion,
that will go there two years later. It is possible for this time ...
man to have new ideas.
<B>  in 1955. </ B> </ i>
Do not forget to show him this.
Stay. What and where are you going? - I ...
Vayolet ... Parpalplam.
Vayolet Parpalplam? - Not everyone is Smith or Miller.
Actually ... looking for where to powdering the nose and lost ...
What is this uniform?
Scout uniform. - Uniforms of scout?
Always be ready! This is the motto of the Scouts.
Be ready.
Yes?
This young lady allegedly lost in the old archives.
Yes, of course, poor girl. Not orient in space.
My dear cousin Hazel.
Hazel ... Vayolet Parpalplam. - Yes. Viz.
Horror, always lose.
Is not it strange to scout, huh?
Do not worry, I have not seen Miss Parpalplam.
He thought you ... - Your mistress.
Or girl of easy virtue. - What?
Hopefully not tell your grandmother. Pregnancy makes it very capricious.
Will soon become a father! Congratulations on behalf of Uncle Henry.
Henry. Nice name.
Here again became a grandfather.
Lucy came to me with Paul.
Come, let's go. Probably tapped behind the net.
I will show you 50 years.
Can you tell me what it means? - No, I have no idea.
I wrote it in the future. I mean ... I will write it.
Listen, everything is not as it thought.
Lucy and Paul saw the box to kill his great-grandfather.
What? - It is so selfish,
that would stop to kill a member of his own family.
Many thanks.
How will such a person calls himself a savior?
Lucy and Paul be sure that my life is in danger.
Believe that Rubin will succeed depends on how the count in achieving your goal.
He will do everything possible to fascinate.
Lucas.
Kenneth? What meeting.
I heard that you have a wonderful young guest.
Let me introduce you. This is my boss, Kenneth December Vilars.
My cousin, Hazel. Ie Vayolet Parpalplam ...
From the province. - From Gloucestershire.
Great boredom and everywhere there were these ... how ...
These ... - Sheep.
Namely, sheep.
Excuse me, are not we met earlier in another setting?
Not hardly.
May in some scout camp. - It is possible.
Thankfully. I thought I would never get rid of it.
Listen, do not let them scare.
Not transmitted must be strong. - I am helpless bundle of nerves.
This is not so. Believe in yourself and you will do.
Again you started? - Yes, beware.
Gideon! Are you okay?
What happened?
Surely it is better not to know about my mission.
Perfectly true.
Why smell of cigars?
It seems as smoked one.
Let's see what these cigars.
October 9, 1955.
It is not the best day for smoking.
Gwendolyn, do you think that everything you are allowed?
And women have a right to think?
Looked at me like I was nobody. Just had sex and now this.
Wait, you said that was nice?
Yes, until it hit him on the head. May have amnesia.
None call. Does not care. - How do you know?
I feel a fool. - Brace yourself.
This is a matter of life and death.
I do not want to lose her best friend,
only because he was mad with love.
You're right, it is.
All right. All night trying to figure out these numbers.
But even if your grandfather did not know how to solve ...
I just can not. - Hey!
What is this? Geolocation is it?
What?
Exactly. These are the coordinates.
Are you aware of this? - Yes, of course. I have GPS.
We can find the place. - And allow De Vilars to charm you?
What should we do? - I have an idea.
Come later, Gideon just disappeared. - Dreams.
After 4 hours of the library.
<I> Meeting in 1955. </ I>
Do you see that you wrote.
<B>  in 1955. </ B> </ i>
Miss Shepherd. I see that you're excited.
Would you like a cigar?
Where is the key?
What key? - Who took here yesterday?
I have nothing ... - Do not lie to me.
I read in the chronicles what happened on October 9, 1953.
A Miss Vayolet Parpalplam visited Lucas Mantrouz.
Vayolet Parpalplam, seriously?
All have taken it for his mistress and your wonderful fit the description.
It means nothing.
Why do not you believe me? - Maybe because I hate lies.
And especially the girls that night you threw,
and in the morning they hit in the head.
What are you saying? - Do not pretend!
I saw Paul in 1912th the church.
And you were very gentle with each other. - What?
Me and Paul? You saw how to kiss or what?
No, but almost.
Who knows what I missed. - It is not possible. I have not been there.
On the contrary, it was. And I do trap.
I'm not, I swear.
What are you doing there?
Gwen, Paul needs your blood.
Gideon, Paul de Vilars not my type.
There must be some explanation. - Yes.
And what is it?
It is difficult to understand of who can be trusted and who is not.
To me you.
Always.
Really.
How then are all these secrets?
Is intolerable when first kiss me, then hate me minute.
Gwen, you constantly dissatisfied. I've had enough.
So does that mean?
Clear. Super.
Finally. Where is Gideon? I'm hungry. - I have no idea.
Did you museums? - Postponed it.
Poor Rafael suffers from headaches.
Does not make me a fool, Charlotte.
Gwen, you come to dinner? - No.
Clear.
He is a fool, you hear?
Repeat it as a mantra.
He said that I kissed Paul, but this is impossible.
Really? In effect, Paul seems ... nice.
Not in the sense that ... Gideon believes me and I believe him.
He is so nice and good, and cares for me.
Then in the park had an awkward moment. - From the variety: "I like you."
or really awkward? - I do not know.
It is not so with Gideon. But what's the point, it is Lucy.
Are you still going through it? Because of her?
"Black Swan" is one of the first pubs in London.
Long walk here, have excellent cuisine.
Not to mention the remarkable waitresses.
And before there were any?
Do not think that you're her first. There were guys before you.
Really?
And then ... how are they?
I am embarrassed to talk about it.
I do not want to gossip, but to tell the truth,
it is not very picky, especially my drink.
That would only tempt me.
And her friend, Leslie? And it you sip?
You serious?
We Rafael. - You and Rafael?
He and I? I wanted, but he was right.
The first letters are coordinates. And you know what?
Of your home. - So ... what then?
Unfortunately, the rest did not understand.
May have page numbers.
Yes. "B".
Just look.
"A".
"And".
Behind the water lilies? Behind the water lilies.
In the house there water lines? - I have no idea.
Here no pictures or carpets.
What if it's another book?
Himerius you still going?
<I> You promised me that you will make out any mystical things with you. </ I>
Why do not you ask her imaginary friend in the house where there are water lilies.
This girl knows what to do.
The house is full of hiding places.
On the ceiling there is a stuffed crocodile.
Very scary. - We are interested only water lilies.
<I> Well, what if you show water lilies? </ I>
Will you buy me a kitten? - No.
No? - Damn.
Well understood. A puppy?
Now what? - Check behind the wallpaper.
<I> Yes, right there. </ I>
Water lilies! - Quiet.
Incredible.
Himerius. - I'm already here.
<I> Nightmare, what dust. Get spider! Otherwise they will eat. </ I>
What's there? - There is a huge chest.
<I> I wonder what's in it? Gold? Diamonds? </ I>
<I> Or the remains of a petulant maid? </ I>
Or second chronograph?
What are you doing here at midnight?
Linked up with the code, which spoke Rafael?
I'll kill him.
Schiffer? Read too many novels.
We searched toilet kit Aunt Glenda. See what I have calluses on feet.
Not at all rococo.
I'll be watching, Gwendolyn.
<I> This must missy nice to nagadelichka. </ I>
Not necessarily something very valuable. Get the scoop from the 17th century or pen.
Will spend several hundred euros in Evau.
Hey, Mr. Jam! Go to unwind.
Yesterday I found a great club.
Chess. - I have to get up early.
Come on, come on. Will be cool. - If I am not in shape, you will have problems.
Do you think that children are working.
No, but you will not stop a little have fun.
Uncle William says so, so he called me to come.
Checkmate.
Did he call you? - Yeah.
Believes that long is your time to get off the girl.
Hey, sorry, man!
I'll find someone else.
We need tools, but will raise a lot of noise.
You need to spend your family from the house.
Maybe today after taking? - I can not go there, Leslie.
Not today and not with Gideon. - Come on, do not sodden.
You'll be the most beautiful, sexiest and most irresistible.
Let asshole understand that he has lost. Do not let Charlotte beat.
You're the best. - I do not, and you.
I feel that the party will be great.
Yes, but there are Earl and Alliance who die do me.
Speaking of him. Look.
This is what we found for the Alliance.
Why do they hate us so? - Because of fear.
Believe that you have the demonic power and want to be equal to God.
See, here is talking about devilish apparatus may be aware chronograph.
Well, see you later.
James, here you?
Here's where you were.
Hello. How are you?
How can I feel like I spent 300 years in a nightmare?
I am glad that finally woke up.
I hope your nightmare will end soon and you will be able
help me with something small.
You know Lord Brompton?
And yet, what are adopted?
The host at Brompton you?
I've heard that served darn tasty punch.
Playing great music, and for dessert served with fruit marzipan.
Say they kept themselves alive in dwarf and swans from Bizet.
How to behave in order not to fight in his eyes?
Got drunk all and allow anyone to isolate himself with you.
And if he be too pushy, tell him ...
you have influential friends, ready to fight a duel for your honor.
Awesome! Great, thank you.
My God, what times were ...
How do you think she would do it?
We tried, but unfortunately, it can not expect miracles.
While many hope. - What would we do without you.
It is better just to take a half-wit,
only to realize that you're time travelers.
Gwen, you do not forget who you are?
I'm Penelope Mary Gray, a protégé of Viscount Bottle IV
I was born in 1766. Are you happy?
Tasteless, botched, ungifted and without dowry.
Just like in life.
Good evening, Mr. Henry Lavandar Gray.
My dear brother, to go, waiting for us.
And this dress is not it ... too challenging?
I'm afraid that you're dressed too modest, Sir Elton John.
Ready? - Only if you're ready.
<B>  in 1783. </ B> </ i>
Miss Penelope Gray, my dear sister,
remember in whose company you are.
For me there is no better company than you, dear brother.
Welcome.
<I> Come here, sweetheart, I will present to the public. </ I>
Our guest of honor, Count Saint-Germain.
And next to him is Lady Lavinia Rokland, the most beautiful and rich widow in London.
Say there are five lover. - Really?
It seems that your brother can become the sixth.
It is devilishly handsome.
There are rumors that the count can read others' thoughts.
Yes, no doubt.
<I> Punch was good. </ I>
<I> Oh, no, he looks at me. He killed his own grandfather. </ I>
<I> He hears me think of something else. </ I>
<I> An owl hair type nuclear explosion, dwarf ... </ i>
<I> Pink Bunny, there is nothing unusual ... </ i>
<I> What was so badgering her? </ I>
<I> We all knew that she likes you. </ I>
<I> Tralee, just think of Gideon and piano ... </ i>
<I> and this stupid wig ... Gideon will now crazy. </ I>
<I> Gideon! </ I>
You become more beautiful than our last meeting.
I wish I was a few years younger ...
Thanks for the compliment.
<I> This old man flirting with me? </ I>
How nice?
Old farts only in your head.
Are you ready now to serve me for the rest of his days?
You belong to me, my child. Do not forget it.
<I> So ... calmly. </ I>
<I> give me hear. You have no power over me. </ I>
<I> I'm not your thing ... and more ... </ i>
<I> I have influential friends who will fight for my honor. </ I>
Here. - Are you threatening me?
How silly.
But how exciting.
My dear friend, I'm impressed how you ...
you work with our third small Rubin.
She is head over heels in love with you.
I'm afraid I can not agree with you.
This is only a blind man would not have noticed.
But I have to be sure that it is ready to devote our goal.
Mr. Gray, I beg you, let me enjoy
your violin. I am convinced that you have virtuoso fingers.
I'll be disappointed if you do not end up doing.
Bravo! - Bravo!
Inimitable!
Why not visit me?
You ... you you played admirably.
But vdovichkata not it a bit long in the tooth for you?
In your words shines jealousy, Miss Gray.
What? I do not really care that will be her sixth.
I have a lot to learn from you.
Is this alcohol?
We're only two hours, and you've already cut off.
He said that I was cut off.
Brace yourself. - I'll tell you all of Charlotte. Sorry.
In music there is something magical, do not you think?
Are ye so musically gifted, Miss Gray?
I love to sing, I simply adore.
Ladies and gentlemen, young Miss Gray
will sing for us. - With pleasure.
No, no singing. - I'll sing.
The young lady is too slight to punch. Please pardon.
Simply amazing how fast time flies.
From this it can be crazy.
But all you need to know
I managed to curb it.
Lord Alistair Florentine Alliance are here! Flee!
They are already here!
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid it's time to end this mayhem.
Four against five? - We are old fellow,
the fat, drunken student and rock star. Calm.
Good evening, Lord Alistair. What a pleasant surprise.
Today will not interfere in God's design
and the rights of creators of merry. We'll take care like you
never to be born!
"Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers,
against spiritual wickedness in high places. "
Epistle to the Ephesians, chapter 6, verse 12.
Why not just strangle them?
Do not you have something special in ridikyula?
What?
Devilish force.
Back!
Stop or I will make hellfire against you!
Witch! She is a witch! Help!
Spawn of the devil!
Faster, get out!
You what? Kiss me?
No.
What frivolity, Miss Shepherd.
Hello.
Behave exactly the opposite of what you were told.
Had to stand next to me and not to vdovichkata.
This was the opposite of what you were told.
Where are we? - At the headquarters of the Bank de Vilars.
Get out until you decide that walking with a stripper.
I see you threefold.
God, how do I look? - I think its pretty chic.
I do not think to take advantage of the fact that her drunk.
I will not let anyone take advantage of me.
No doubt.
I have seen many things, but no idea what it is.
Undoubtedly strong, but it smells ... gin and soot.
Have her coffee.
Many coffee.
Leslie?
I prom ...
God, how drunk? - Too many.
And also sang too much.
No one is home, my dear. "Tosca". - Opera you?
Miraculously found tickets.
And Caroline is in the pension, so that no one will bother us.
You're the best.
Gin is a wonderful drink, but do not you too young
evening athleticism, especially without me?
Upon request, arranged for a pick and hammer.
Somewhere I've seen him before. Open it faster.
Miss Gwendolyn, I advise you to open the chest in your room,
where it will not disturb you.
Chronograph!
I am free, Leslie!
Gwen says here your name. - What?
Letter from Lucy.
Gwendolyn my dear, I'm glad you found our chronograph.
Guard it with your life, because the time comes.
We go to church "Holy Trinity" every Sunday.
I'll meet you there.
There instruction.
Works!
See inside there beakers with droplets of blood.
Yes, missing only mine and that of Gideon.
Are you serious? Right here you?
Not going to walk around the city, when caught in the 1912th.
Give it here.
I have a bad feeling.
<B>  in 1912. </ B> </ i>
God, my apples! - Forgive me, I did not.
Where do you got?
Paul?
Excuse me, I ...
Gwendolyn!
You are here? Alone? - Yes.
Gwen!
Do not believe him, this is a trap, he wants your blood!
God, you ... How can so hit man?
Gideon! What are you doing here?
He only protect me.
Hide it until it was time to go back.
Gwendolyn!
Paul. Why not just keep it?
Gwendolyn, do not worry, he will take care of it.
It should be safe!
You should tell her.
Gwendolyn ...
you're our daughter.
We are your parents.
What?
Not true.
No.
Only then can they protect.
Forgive us, but we had only one exit.
Do they leave Grace. It is hard to imagine a better stepmother.
I can not believe that she is not my mother.
Excuse me, I just ... - No, no ... nothing.
I'm sure Grace is the best.
She knows how they sleepy with what they foods
And these diseases, vaccines ...
And how do they keep the boys, drugs, and God forbid, the Internet.
I know, but for me it is still half a year old and wears diapers.
Lucy, do not worry about me.
I'm used to these calls.
"Honey, your life is in danger, you're special."
But you really are special, You're our daughter.
You are stronger than the column, because the child of time travelers.
You're stronger than him.
So we wanted to grow beyond the impact of the lodge.
But I will not lie, the count will try to break it.
Show them how brave. "Prove that you can." That's our motto.
The rise of the eagle means the return of the column.
Receiving power over time will become invulnerable.
The aim of the new world order is not the good of humanity,
and his own.
For centuries, developing rules of so-called elite.
Intend to control everything, cash flows, vintage, water,
vaccines schools.
Will destroy everything that contradicts their ideas.
But what can we do?
I will go back in 1983, to meet with Florentine Alliance.
Alistair Lord promised to give us the stolen memoir column.
We assume that there is a specific plan.
Do not do it. They are really dangerous and want to kill us.
This is our only chance. This will help us and you.
What will you help me? Not so anymore.
Gwendolyn.
We love you dearly, never forget.
What is the real mother Gwendolyn? Who is she?
What is ?! - As if the name begins with 'L' ...
Lucy or Lusilda or ...
Lucy! - Lucy?
Lucy Mantrouz! Sapphire.
Incredible. - They wanted to hide it.
Rubin is a descendant of the man and woman are carriers of the gene.
That is why it is special.
Drop in January
Visitor drove us to her home.
Is there anything else, Gideon?
Gideon? - Leslie, I need Gwen. Call January
She is not here at the moment but will soon return.
<I> Where are you? </ I>
She went to the 1912th and has not yet returned.
It is very dangerous. He could be anywhere. Captured, wounded, captured.
How can it be so reckless? You can find it.
<I> Gwendolyn. You're our daughter. </ I>
<I> We had only one exit. Do they leave Grace. </ I>
<I> This is the answering machine of Grace Shepherd. </ I>
<I> Say something nice after the beep. </ I>
Hello, Grace.
Or can you still call you Mom?
Only unfortunately, you are not my mother.
And once so, my whole life is a lie.
Damn, why did not you tell me?
Are you scared or had decided that I was too dumb to figure it out?
Or was easier not to say that I do not belong to this family?
Nick is not my brother, and dad is not my daddy?
I ...
Why did not you tell me?
<I> Do not cry. </ I>
Have you forgotten that you have an ally?
Little demon who is willing to destroy all your enemies.
Get out, Get out! You do not understand anything!
But ...
This is water from the gargoyle.
It leads us to her. Since.
Wait for me here.
Gwen! Gwen!
Thankfully.
Gideon ... my mother ...
I, Lucy and Paul, they ...
It's a big lie.
I do not have anyone. - Not true.
Will not get rid of me. Do not even think.
And that you saw me with Paul ...
was paternal hug, nothing more.
I know.
I'll take you home.
Does nothing to say?
No. Why?
It seems one of us.
A real December Vilars. - Do not even dream.
Between us there is at least 5 generations.
The next time you tell me that you are going in the past. Okay?
This is very dangerous.
There are many things to be afraid.
Will tell you that the second chronograph is in me?
And you do you think?
<I> "Voicemail. You have one message." </ I>
Where were you?
I was with Lucy.
Promise that you will always be my mother, whatever happens.
Always, whatever happens.
Forgive me.
May someday understand.
You you know, how much always ...
I think so.
How is Lucy? - He was very upset.
Paul was quite calm, but his eyes constantly watery.
They like me, but you ...
I'd give anything to see Lucy again.
Do me pancakes? With apple syrup?
As you want, baby.
This robe Aunt Maddy Is?
Sure ... it was terrible to grow up in such conditions, Gwendolyn?
But this time, I'll provide security and care.
Today you will meet with the column. Afternoon visit in 1783.
Just not this. Required? - You are his servant.
You'll have to come. Still obliged me, remember?
What?
What blackmail! If you do not do what I want, I will tell them about the chronograph?
Have you believe. Only so will we.
And I wanted to be alone. We talk.
For my parents? - Can you shut up for one minute?
I'm trying to gather all his courage to tell you something nice.
And I have a lot of experience.
In those days many try not to think about you, but ...
this is impossible.
With you never know what to expect. You're so hard, complex and ...
Unbearable. - Something nice?
Really have no experience. - The next time you're smart ...
bold and beautiful.
I know it's against the rules, and the earl romantic nonsense,
but I do not care, because we belong.
And the worst is that they see, I want to kiss you.
Yes, that's really terrible.
And why are you telling me right now? - Because I can no longer so.
Can not you ever get angry and worried about you.
I want to be a team. No more secrets.
Showdown. No more lies and tricks.
You mean a lot to me.
Together we're invincible, whatever happens.
I want you to have confidence.
I love you.
Really? - Yes, really.
You can take a breath.
Inhale, exhale.
Stop, very arrogant.
Damn I like that because I forget to breathe.
Madame.
More accurate you by my watch, my dear.
Already met tomorrow.
Like these paradoxes. How will pass intake?
Terrible. Alliance attacked us.
Yes, but I ... that we defeated Lord Alistair.
I'm in your incredible swordsmanship, my young ...
Gwen found in ridikyula something very useful.
I'll remind him there.
Do you share that our dear friend, Lady Lavinia.
Again this Lady Lavinia ...
And wait for your answer.
Now, you, my dear ...
It's nice that went on our side.
Thinking it left us.
We will guide you.
<I> You are wrong. Will believe only myself. </ I>
<I> I'm not stupid and will not fall into your networks. </ I>
Very naive if you think that little girl just will resist eagle.
Gideon is on my side.
Really? You absolutely sure?
Currently your lover is visiting Lady Lavinia
and this is a wonderful way to make the time.
Gwendolyn, smart woman knows how to hide his jealousy.
What? But this is ... well.
I am impressed with how well and quickly Gideon
cope with the task.
With the task?
Probably not have had much to strive,
to drop the heart of the little girl in his legs.
I assure you that my heart is not fall into anyone's feet.
Just realized that much easier to manage lovers women.
No, this is not true.
There is nothing more painful than a broken heart.
My dear.
If you wish to be happy, you will be happy
but if you wish to suffer, you will suffer.
And only death can free you from this fate.
Why not just accept that your life is completely in my hands?
Then I could keep you from such painful proof.
Gwen!
Wait!
Gwen! What happened?
What is it?
Earl told me that you ... that you ...
both think that love women managed much easier.
What? No. - Yes.
Well played. And so he thinks.
Ha, ha. No more secrets. Ha, ha. I want you to have confidence.
Ha, ha. I love you.
God, this blood is it? - It is not mine. Found something.
I do not understand what you mean. - Is it true?
Can we talk later? - Now.
Now. Just say yes or no.
Earl commanded to make me fall in love with you. Yes or no?
Yes.
Thanks, that was honest.
Liberty taken the liberty to hide your phone
behind my hunting gear.
No one will dare to look there.
Above his head, Gwendolyn.
Do you remember that?
So yet.
I promise you for sure.

Did you bring the memoirs of a column? - Of course, that's them.
Some fanatical contraptions.
All known facts about the column, the Lodge and its members.
Swear to God
that will use it only against column, not against carriers of the gene.
Anyway, I will take it from you, dead or alive.
Will destroy you, demon.
Die, demon!
Paul! - Time will repent.
Beat it!
And you too! Come on, get out.
Paul!
Gideon December Vilars? Are you alive, my boy?
I'm fine ...
but you're wounded.
It was worth it.

More than its origin and life? Will fight you for it?
