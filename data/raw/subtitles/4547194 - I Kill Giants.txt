I worked overtime again,
rely made it home to make
dinner for my beloved siblings.
No, he offered me the promotion!
Basically. It was implied.
Come on! Switch weapons!
U'll never win with that BB gun!
Ever get laid with that haircut.
- Dave, really?
- Really. It's a shitty haircut.
We have the same haircut.
You guys should try a real game.
Use some imagination.
Save some electricity.
I have a good beginner dungeon.
Yeah, good luck with
that nerd queen!
Watch those corners!
Oh God! No!
Shit!
Ou at least quiet down a little?
Switch around! Switch around!
Shit! Yes...
and wave it like a flag.
Oh shit, oh shit.
That was a saving throw.
I rolled to see if you'd
survive a blackout spell.
You didn't. See? Isn't that fun?
What the hell's wrong with you?
Dinner's ready, so game's over.
Damn right it's over.
Busted my ass on that, you punk!
Smells like your ass too!
Jesus, Dave! My mom's making
crap for dinner. I wanted meat!
I'm not making anything else!
The die never lie.
'd play your Dragons or
whatever if you asked me to.
That would be hilarious.
- You're serious? Y not?
You make it sound like...
I don't know, I'm just saying
that I'd play if you asked.
When, exactly?
Can you hang on a second.
It's a shower night tonight,
so lights out at 9:30.
Kill you to wash a dish either.
Hey. Nothing really.
It's just the usual.
My brother is a snarling ball
of anger and my sister is...
herself.
Good times.
"Dishes."
You really need to prioritize.
She just wants to play with you.
By unplugging the TV?
Embarrassing me in
front of my friends?
Dave, u're on that
thing all the time.
Barbara is reaching
out, and that's good.
No, it's weird and stupid!
- Why do you care... loud
or she'll hear us talking.
(Eep exhale
increasing in volume)
it popped up again!
On third, Hayes has room.
Hayes makes the catch!
Thurisaz.
The Thorn. The Hammer.
Take the force of my enemy
and send it back to him a
thousand thousand times.
Time to work.
One, two, three, four, five,
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen...
Hi.
Are you playing a game?
I don't think so.
Oh.
If you were, I would...
join you or... I don't know.
I'm Sophia.
Moved here from Leeds, England.
E here knows Leeds. Only London.
It's stinky.
- What's it for?
- Pray you never find out.
What's with the ears?
Tribute to my spirit guide.
Oh! That's interesting.
I, uh... Nice meeting you.
You have a pretty name.
- And I like the way you talk.
- Thank you.
What's your...
Okay...
thanks.
I understand what "these
times" require, sir.
're allowed three personal days,
and I know that Mr. Guggenheim
considers personal attendance.
No, my sister, she's just a
kid, she can't help, she's...
She can't help with anything.
Um, I'm not a special case. Just
asking for common courtesy!
Bviously, I want to keep my job.
I'm just...
Okay.
Y, thank you so much, thank you.
Okay, bye.
Bye.
Can I look too?
Thanks!
At the same bus stop. Hi, again.
Wow, that looks cool!
Yeah, that's it. Dark
Omens are totally "cool".
What does that mean?
It means my life is about
to get complicated.
Again.
Can I sit next to you?
Why?
You're the only kid I know
in like, all of America.
Hi.
Are you going h's birthday
party this weekend?
Nine...
Ten...
Eleven...
Twelve...
Thirteen...
Fourteen...
Thirty-four...
Thirty-five...
Thirty-six...
Thirty-seven...
Thirty-eight...
Damn it!
- Excuse me.
- You're excused.
Make a better door than window.
My table.
You owe me a toll.
Give it.
That's all I got.
Keep the change.
You're dead!
Barbara Thorson!
Barbara Thorson! Mrs.
Mollé's office, now.
Please!
Have fun at the shrink, psycho.
She is so weird.
You might not believe this, know
more about Birch than I do.
New here, so you're the expert.
I was hoping you can tell me le
bit about what you like here,
what you don't.
I've already heard to stay
away from the beef teriyaki.
I really like your pocketbook.
It's nice.
I don't know what
Covliski means.
Cov... Covliski.
What does it mean?
Strike one.
What?
Arbara, you're not being tested.
We're just talking.
Record, I'm not being difficult
I think your profession is B.S.
I'm busy so I don't have time
be delicate with your feelings.
So you don't even want
to know why you're here?
Because people fear what
they don't understand.
D with that, so we're done here.
And next time,
use a sky writer to call
me to the shrink's office.
- Less embarrassing.
- No, I told them...
Yeah.
Wow...
nk it's funny to spit on people?
Not "ha-ha" funny, but
existentially, yes.
You're a disgusting little
bitch.
Open your pocketbook.
What I find, I keep.
If you don't walk away,
right now,
I will do things to you
that will make God cry.
Taylor!
What's going on?
My office.
Now.
A week's suspension.
Let's go.
You're pretty brave
for someone who looks like
they live in a magazine.
I saw Taylor grab you
and got the principal.
You stood up to her.
Think you didn't?
You think I did?
I did.
She's gonna kill me.
No.
Taylor's a bully. All
bullies are the same:
Soon as you stand up
to them, they crumble.
Just like giants.
Giants?
Like in your books?
Ragons and stuff? You like that?
It's weird?
I don't know.
Yeah. A little.
What's so cool about giants?
This is my sanctuary.
A holy place.
You want to know about giants,
you learn here.
It's been said
ll giants are descended from Ur,
the first giant,
who was the misbegotten
son of the Earth and Sky.
Twenty miles tall...
What?
Misbegotten means the
Earth and the Sky did it,
but they weren't married?
Yeah.
Y older brother was misbegotten.
Okay.
So Ur is twenty miles tall,
but he's alone.
He's the only one.
S so lonely that in his anguish,
he tears himself apart.
Giving birth
to giants.
E first dark kings of the Earth.
At least that's what
they liked to think.
Giants are vermin,
like rats or pigeons.
But huge, of course.
They can hit thirty feet
and come in all flavors.
Giants have hair of living ice,
and use human kidney
garnish when they eat reindeer.
Swamp Giants will clear out
a whole village of people,
just to replace them with
dolls made of vines.
Mountain Giants bathe in
the blood of children,
and have a penchant for
singing shepherd songs.
Hese creeps, they're Harbingers.
They just like to watch.
Totally sketchy.
A Harbinger, a Giant is around.
Even worse, though, Titans.
These are the big guys.
Like Greek myth stuff.
Hearts of blackest opal.
H boils your blood in your body.
Eyes that make the sun go out.
Can you imagine that?
Something so horrible,
the sun won't shine on it.
Don't be scared.
No one's seen a Titan ce the
dawn of recorded history.
Good.
Real problem is regular giants.
Total dicks.
This was a bad year for giants.
People always write them off
nadoes and earthquakes and crap,
but if you open your eyes, ee
the omens and know the truth.
Ever lose a dog?
- Yeah, it got hit by a car.
- Probably not.
Ably hors d'oeuvres for a giant.
- No, my dad backed over it.
- Oh.
Lucky.
So what if you do see the omens
and one really comes?
That's where I come in.
I find giants.
I hunt giants.
I kill giants.
With this.
Inside this modest sheath
slumbers the finest war hammer
ever made.
He thunder-maker. Light bringer.
Forged from a fragment of bone
from the jaw of Ur himself...
One perfect strike
drop even the tallest of giants.
Can I see it?
This is a sacred vessel.
Only be opened when duty calls.
"Coveleski."
Weapons of great renown
have to have a name.
Coveleski was a baseball player.
Ie for the Philadelphia
Phillies 100 years ago.
Are you okay?
What's the matter? Barbara?
Sorry... I have to go.
Barbara! Hey!
N't want to get too close to me.
People close to me get hurt.
I'm over here!
Now this way, you big idiot.
Damn it...
Barbara!
Barbara!
Barbara!
Barbara!
Barbara!
I made a friend.
Her name is Sophia.
She wears nice clothes, but...
nglish so that's to be expected.
, see? I'm normal. Can I go now?
There's serious stuff going
down I have to deal with.
Do you have many friends?
Right.
Why not, Barbara?
Because most kids my age
care more about who's on TV
or if they have cool
sneakers than talking to me.
And I'm a little mean
to people who are dumb.
And most people are dumb.
Is your sister Karen dumb?
Amily is "strike two" territory.
Barbara...
I'm sorry.
Etimes I push too hard too soon,
but it's because I want to
get to know you a bit more.
Okay?
I'll go first.
I wasn't always a
psychologist...
That would be impossible unless
you were cloned from one.
- I assume you were a baby.
- Yes, I was a baby.
Then a child,
then a young woman,
a manager of a small hedge fund.
The good kind or did you
rip off old ladies?
I wasn't sure.
So I decided I wanted
to try something else.
To make a difference doing this.
Is that corny?
The word "corny" is corny.
Ng to make a difference is
nice, but you think too small.
All me when you've saved a town,
and we can compare notes.
Have you saved a town?
Tect this dump like once a month
n't go around bragging about it.
What do you protect us from?
If you have to ask, ou clearly
haven't read my file.
I have a file.
Yes, but this file doesn't
tell me who you are,
how you feel.
Delicious!
Right.
Us Walter: "Something So Strong"
Gumbs, Nehring,
Rugg, you're in red.
E rest of you are in blue today.
You know that forest
giant I told you about?
He's getting ballsy!
We have to find him.
I don't want to get
anyone into trouble.
We're already in trouble.
Hey! L'il Posh Spice!
Zip it! Thorson, drop the book.
Huddle up!
Today we're gonna take a stab
at America's favorite pastime:
baseball.
Miss Laney? Can I be excused?
I might have food poisoning
or a twisted ankle.
It's just baseball, Thorson.
You just stand there...
- I'll take the F. Thanks.
- I thought you liked baseball.
You said Coveleski was a...
Harry Coveleski?
That's some obscure
baseball history, Thorson.
Coveleski hasn't played
in like a hundred years.
Any Phillies fans in the family?
Miss Laney,
would you describe your job
worthless or utterly pointless?
Principal's office.
Now.
I cherish our times together.
Re the Dalai Lama of principals.
Shall I make it a month?
No thank you, sir.
Namaste.
Get out of here.
Cool.
This is a sacred vessel.
It can only be opened
when duty calls.
No. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I wasn't really...
wasn't really going to open it.
Sorry. I have forgotten myself.
Holy quest. Coveleski is sacred.
It won't ever happen again.
I swear. I swear. I swear.
Please follow staff instructions
nd proceed in an orderly fashion
to your assigned areas
outside of the building...
Okay, please. Move along.
Lucy, Jim.
Where are you going?
There's still three periods!
Did you get the note?
There are times you
have to ask yourself,
"Do I want to live
my life as a coward
or a warrior?"
Decide.
Where are we going?
I've been working on a plan
to lead it away from the town
to the old train graveyard.
Stay close.
Stay calm.
T won't hurt you while I'm here.
Barbara, how long
is this gonna take?
Be quiet. It's up ahead.
- We'll get in trouble.
- We're gonna save this town.
Ould have taken the second bait.
Ng must've caught its attention.
Re is no way this wouldn't work.
- Let's go back.
We'll say we got locked out.
Hold on. You need to see
what we're dealing with.
Giants aren't real.
Then why are you sweating?
There you have it.
Can't compete with a baby deer.
Once they find food they
don't go for the bait.
We're going to have to track it.
I want to see if it took a
bite out of this guy, though.
Might give me some clues.
It sucked it up good.
It's pretty drained.
This is weird, Barbara.
I want to go home. Now.
Please!
Sophia!
Harbingers...
(ted voice) What good will you
be against real monsters?
Even a dim-witted forest giant
has baffled you... twice!
It will be back.
Just a child,
so weak,
so weak.
Do you have wood in your garage?
You won't get in trouble. Ell
anyone and I'll protect you.
Harbingers are creeps. You
don't want them around you.
Are you afraid of blood?
Yes.
Don't look.
Just squeeze the ice.
I don't like this.
- I know you're into it, but...
- It's your ward of protection.
It has to be your blood.
It all the time without any ice.
Come on.
Sophia,
I know I'm an awkward freak.
I know no one likes me.
Hat everything I do looks crazy.
But this will protect you
when I'm not around.
And I'd feel better
knowing that you're safe.
Trust me.
Look into my eyes and say this:
Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer.
Thurisaz. The Thorn. The Hammer.
Take the force of my enemy
and send it back to him a
thousand thousand times.
He force of my enemy and send it
o him a thousand thousand times.
Are you gonna do it?
D it when you looked in my eyes.
Thank you.
Here's a high drive,
left field, well hit!
Back there, it is... a home run!
It's a long fly ball...
Barbara!
Barbara?
Barbara?
I can hear your tapes
in the whole house.
I have to be up early tomorrow.
I sure do! High finance
is a man's world,
I don't let anything get me
down because I have gumption!
Chew gumption after every meal!
Stinky! Beloved cubicle-mate.
E I told you if you only smelled
like butt dipped in tuna
that would be an improvement?
Hink Stinky needs to get to bed.
Luckily I, Glorious Guggenheim,
save you from a life of drudgery
and olfactory assault with...
a promotion!
Ank you so much, Mr. Guggenheim!
It's very nice of you.
T I don't need a pity promotion.
I'm gonna figure this out.
That's the smartest thing
you've ever said, big Karen.
Thank you, little Karen.
Perhaps I should talk to
my little sister more too.
I'm trying, Barbara.
I wanna try something new.
A game.
People play too many games.
Let's just keep it honest.
Okay.
Honestly?
I put my neck on the line to
keep you out of suspension
your little stunt in gym class.
It's a word game.
I say a word and you
say a word back, okay?
Like... game.
No!
I... lose.
Diamond.
Fake.
Mrs. Mollé,
gs are happening. I have to go...
- Baseball.
Baseball.
Baseball.
Barbara...
You're holding my hand.
It's okay.
I'm your friend.
Someone you can talk to if
you're having problems.
- I have to go to the bathroom...
- Like if you're... angry,
if you're... afraid.
- Please let me go.
- What's making you sad...
- Please let me go.
- Like what's going on at home.
With Karen and Dave...
Kinarus, kinarus
Coveleski...
Weapons of great renown
have to have a name.
Barbara...
A game.
I say a word and you
say a word back.
Barbara...
Baseball.
Harry Coveleski...
Coveleski was a baseball player,
a rookie
for the Philadelphia Phillies.
That's some obscure
baseball history, Thorson.
Any Phillies fans in the family?
Sophia!
Nice one, psycho.
- I'm sorry! I didn't...
- She's a total psycho.
Sophia!
Please...
Sorry dinner's late.
Sorry dinner's gonna suck.
Coast guard. The red tide's in.
I had to kiss ass and stay late
because my day got
derailed by a phone call.
We all had issues today.
- I'm trying to move forward.
- You hit a goddamn teacher!
I would never hit a teacher.
They don't get paid
enough for that abuse.
- She's a psychologist.
- Are you freaking mental?
Ouch!
Son of a bitch!
I can't do this.
How can I do this by myself?
U two won't grow up and help me.
Can't deal with you going crazy!
Ou act out, they call me at work
n I have to deal with your shit.
Roblem for me because I'm trying
my best to hold it all together.
Bara. This is not fair, Barbara!
Hey, this is not fair!
- You're not running away!
- Yes, I am!
No, you're not! Why
are you fighting me?
I'm trying to help you.
So is the shrink!
If you want to fight somebody,
tand up to that bully at school!
Says the whiney doormat who
can't talk to her own boss!
You have no idea what
I've given up for you.
Neither do you!
She's crazy, but she
knows how to punch.
It... was an accident.
T did not look like an accident.
She's my friend.
Shouldn't be.
People will talk about you too.
Besides,
crazy people can't have friends.
It's part of their sickness.
I get it.
You're a nice kid.
You want to help her, like
a dog with a broken leg.
Only way to help a crazy person
is to expose their sickness.
've seen her crazy stuff, right?
I bet she showed you her traps
and weird shit!
I like you.
You're pretty.
You could be cool.
I'll make you a deal.
Ll me some of the crazy stuff...
and I'll tell you a secret
about your friend.
Close the door, please.
Tell me about giants.
How come I'm not expelled?
I know you called Karen.
People in New Jersey
know you called Karen.
Y didn't you tell the principal?
Everyone gets one.
I can excuse one.
Do I need to expand?
Why do giants have to die?
Looking at them, they
look pretty silly to me.
If I remember, Mickey Mouse
beat giants twice
with no problem.
Those are so stupid!
God!
A giant comes to a place...
destroys everything in its path.
Worse than that.
It's not like a dumb
cartoon or something.
A giant...
What?
A giant...
is hate.
Smashing stuff isn't enough.
A giant takes.
It takes everything from you.
And when it's done...
It's like anything that
made your life good
was never even there.
It's horrible.
Barbara...
are you afraid of giants?
No.
I'm not afraid of them.
Because I have Coveleski.
With this I can stop it.
If I'm strong enough.
If I stay focused.
If I'm worthy...
I can stop death itself.
Coveleski sounds very special.
May I see it?
After school!
No!
- I'll show you then.
- Now is perfect.
What's going to happen?
Barbara, please stay!
Damn it.
Look at all this crap!
I told you.
Giant traps. What a freak!
Ilarious. Can we burn this shit?
Ugh!
Ugh.
Stop it, Taylor!
Stop it
or I'm going to kill you.
Us about your stupid junk here.
She knows you're a
messed up psycho.
You gonna kill her too?
She'll get hers.
You said you wouldn't touch it.
Worry about yourself.
Coveleski is about to speak.
Come on. She's nothing.
What happened to it?
I'm sorry! Fight back!
Sorry!
Barbara!
Sophia... Why did you
bring me upstairs?
We never go upstairs!
Come here!
Slowly.
Please!
Don't let it see you.
Sophia!
- Mrs. Mollé!
- Barbara?
I'm sorry.
(Niffling) It's the 21st century.
Yone knows where everyone lives.
What happened to you?
Something's wrong with me.
No, honey. There's
nothing wrong with you.
There she is!
O happy Mommy's home, aren't we?
- Just one second.
- We've been crying for an hour.
Oh my gosh.
Momma's here, Momma's here...
Momma's here. It's okay.
Oh, you picked up a stray?
This is my friend, Barbara.
Hey.
Barbara, this is my husband
and here is
the reason why I've been
tired all the time.
Her name is Jacqueline, own as Mrs.
Fussy Colicky Pants.
Yeah.
She's doing better.
She's going to die.
- What did she say?
- No, it's fine.
Everyone's going to die.
Do you want to come inside?
Wait, Barbara.
Barbara, come inside!
Barbara!
Ondon Grammar: "Under the Stars"
Where are you?
Come fight me!
Let me call you right back.
Karen?
It's just not possible
ause I put her on the
bus myself every day.
T the last few days, apparently.
I have to leave before the bus,
but I pack her goddamn book
bag and make breakfast.
I've left messages, Ms. Thorson.
A lot of the time I just leave
out cereal and milk. Or...
I don't...
I think yesterday Dave
ate left over chicken surprise.
It's all falling apart.
I'm falling apart.
You've done the best you can.
Coveleski.
In 1908,
Coveleski, a left-handed rookie m
the coal mines of Pennsylvania
hrust into the spotlight when...
The pitcher was called to
the mound by the Phillies
to do battle against the
unstoppable New York Giants.
At only twenty-one,
Coveleski stunned the nation.
He decimated the Giants' lineup
- three times in five days...
- Mom, let me do this part!
Coveleski's story captured earts
of fans across the nation,
earning him the nickname
The Giant Killer.
The Giant Killer.
See, you never give up, Barbara.
H I could have seen those games.
But then you'd be old.
Anny said I could use the table.
Why weren't you at school?
Do you know what a
meme of malcontent is?
's when someone can think a
name and send a person to hell,
where their skin is cooked off
and made into pies for demons.
I'm meme-ing you right now.
Rought Mrs. Mollé to your house.
- You're scaring us, Barbara...
- I'm scaring you?
When bloody parts of
people fall out of the sky
and all you can see is red,
then you'll be scared.
And it'll be your fault.
You betrayed me!
Coveleski is broken!
Because of you your
bony-assed friend, Taylor!
Without it I'm nothing.
On't be able to stop the giant...
- There is no giant! Just stop!
I trusted you!
N why didn't you
tell me about...
Stupid!
Pathetic.
Weaker than before,
playing your game as
the giant draws near.
We waste our time.
E have no spirit for this. Lost.
Confused.
Friendless.
When the giant finds you, you
will find yourself alone
and quivering.
Prove yourself.
Prove yourself. Now!
Iting at the edge of the forest.
What did you do?
Saved you and every other
idiot in this stupid town.
But tell me again I'm crazy.
I've kept my solemn oath.
I've kept the darkness
at bay.
I have shown my worth.
Please return Coveleski to me.
On Doppler radar,
e see a rapidly developing front
along the Jersey coastline.
Very rare for this time of year
and surprisingly powerful.
Barbara?
Three hours ago, we forecasted
a sunny weekend, and now...
Barbara?
Practically out of nowhere.
Me counties in Southern New York
are issuing tornado warnings.
Ly doubt we're gonna see that...
- Hello?
- Karen? Hi.
Hi, it's Mrs. Mollé.
Is Barbara with you?
No, she didn't go to school?
She came to school, yes. But...
ere was an incident with Taylor.
What, another fight?
No, something else.
Barbara went after Taylor.
It was very upsetting.
The details don't matter now.
I just want to make sure
that Barbara's okay.
Elder spirits, I have
killed the giant
and set my house in order.
Please. Give it back.
You ok?
- Taylor?
- I'm gonna kill that bitch!
Taylor! Get back here, now.
Attention, students...
Stop!
Barbara!
Her your things and report to...
Barbara!
Go home.
Go hug your... family.
I thought it was over,
but something's wrong.
Hought I could sacrifice
Taylor, but they need more.
I didn't want to kill anything.
That's black magic.
- This stuff is already dead.
- Barbara...
Barbara, I went to your house.
Go home, please.
- Let me work!
- You work isn't real!
Let's get in the car.
I'll take you home.
You're not listening to me!
Another giant is coming.
If I don't fix Coveleski,
I can't kill it!
Barbara.
Your mother... wants to see you.
Why are you acting weird?
I don't...
I don't have...
- The giant...
- No! No!
Okay?
Your mother is sick.
Do you understand?
That's reality, Barbara.
- And you have to face it.
- No!
Barbara!
Stop it!
I said stop!
Up! She's not even your friend!
That freak crossed the line!
She's not a freak.
Her mom is sick, okay?
Really sick!
I am her friend!
I don't give a shit.
You can all die together.
Ahh!
I hate you!
I hate you!
Barbara!
What happened?
I tried to stop her but...
It's okay! Come on, we
have to get inside.
My leg...
What's happening?
It's time.
- Take cover.
- We have to get inside!
Sophia... Please.
If you can't run, hide.
Now.
Barbara!
Oh no... It's a titan.
You can't have her!
You can't have her, you hear me?
You will not hurt my mother!
I beat you.
I beat you!
My mom is going to live
because I beat you.
She is going to live!
Little warrior...
you fought with honor.
But I did not come for her.
I came for you.
I came... for you.
But I beat you.
I beat you.
I know, child.
I know.
I can't save her?
So finish it.
L things that live in this world
die.
This is why you must
find joy in the living,
while the time is yours.
And not fear the end.
To deny this
is to deny life.
But...
to embrace it.
Can you embrace it?
Barbara!
You are stronger than you think.
: Climatologists are
dumbfounded by the storm
that ripped through Long Island.
Ve been no significant tornadoes
in this area for decades.
Ditions to generate such a storm
are considered extremely rare.
There were no warning signs and
nothing officials could do.
Lously, despite the devastation,
there were only minor
injuries and no casualties.
Mom?
I'm scared to open my eyes.
Am I dreaming?
No, Mom.
No.
There was a big storm.
I heard it.
Was it scary?
No.
I'm not scared of storms.
Neither am I.
They can be...
They can be sort of beautiful.
And then afterwards,
it's so quiet.
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Shh.
M sorry I was scared to see you.
Hush...
Hush, now.
Let's get right to it!
Who wants to tell me something
they did this summer?
Ht, I'll pick a brave volunteer.
Barbara Thorson?
Y break wasn't very interesting.
I needed a lot of rest, so...
I ate, slept, played.
Hung out with my mom.
Led a Titan with her bare hands!
Technically, that was
before the holidays.
And she used a hammer.
But she did that too.
Um, right.
Okay... Anybody else?
Barbara.
Is it time?
Karen's on her way. The
doctor says it's soon.
Are you afraid?
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Okay.
Are you ready?
Oken Twin: "A Glimpse of a Time"
Thank you.
I'm all right.
We're all going to be all right.
We're stronger than we think.
