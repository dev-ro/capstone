It's Thongs. To win in treble
4, 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8, $10,000 each bet
Thongs
Who is it?
This is Ivy
Why are you still calling me?
Where are you?
I wish I knew
Don't bother me with secular matters
Go to hell!
Same to you
If that can solve anything, I won't be a monk
You'll burn in hell!
Mind your language, dear
It's an enhanced Siemens 304
refitted with infrared rays
The fuse is on the right, go left
It's me again
4, 8 and 3 for races 3, 4 and 8,
$10,000 each to place
I was recently enlightened
Reach for the sky with limited resources
Too many women, too little time
Going after them all is a losing game
Therefore I have decided
to focus only on the wealthy ones
The only way to get rich
is to find a rich wife
Great!
You think so too?
Move up a bit
More?
More

Damn! I lost by a whisker
You'll gamble your life away
Get lost

Not much here
It hurts...
Relax, Mrs. Li
You must spread your legs
Relax, open up! Open them wide
What are you doing?
Can't you read?

Forget the cheap stuff
Get Taxol
They're for chemotherapy, they cost $8,000 each
Go for these
Relax...
Now push, harder...
Push harder!
OK. There we go
See for yourself, boy or girl?
We're done. We're coming down
Let's rendezvous outside Block B
B for Barcelona?
B for Boy
Smart ass! Block Boy it is
B for Boy
Act normal
How? I look like I'm pregnant
and you the Hunchback of Notre Dame
Excuse me, tell me...
Don't ask
Doctors can have humps and pot bellies
Don't discriminate against the disabled
Control...
Hello! Dr. Tsui?

Yes. There's an emergency?
Run!
Split up
Don't get caught,
and don't spill the beans if you do
Hey! Get out!
Sorry!
No. 3

I should've backed No. 9
I'm sure he'll make it
Hang in there, Dad...
Pardon me...
Why, Dad...

Who are you?
Who is he?
Chan
Sorry... wrong ward
I was looking for a Wong
I'm so sorry... excuse me

Calm down! Don't do this!
Mani, leave with me
We'll raise the kid
You're crazy! Give me my child
Come with me! Stop crying...

Again! Whose bet is this?
How's the displacement?
This is for kids
I'm asking you about the displacement
Kids...
Don't worry, I'm just teasing you
I had my eye on this one
Here's my deposit, prepare the contract
Ready...
Go!

If you can sense a hair...
Nothing can stop you
Hair? That's impossible

Mommie, it's Superman!
Yoshihama abalone, Uncle! $10,000 a piece
There's more than a hundred of them
That's more like it
Come on! Come on...
Come on!
Player 3, dealer 7. Dealer takes all
How much?
This should be enough.
Keep the change
Why don't you use a credit card?
That's just her tip
Credit Card
I'll look around again, wait for me at the door
OK!
That's a discount card from a sushi store
Of course I know
We'll take these as well
Keep the change!
Stop being a bad loser
Quit if you can't bear to lose
You're dead if you don't pay me back
I'll pay up in a second
OK!
Why put the money in the refrigerator?
Why?
That's not a refrigerator. It's a safe
But don't tell anyone
Thanks
This label is fantastic
But I've ordered something even betterfor you
It'll be here soon
Try this, Miss
New tissue paper with ftoral fragrance
Try the floral fragrance
Hands oft!
Come on...
What the hell, Spooky?
What now, Hairy?
Where's the money from?
When are you going to pay up?
Hands oft me!
If I win, you'll get your money
Right away!
Let's see about that
Come on...
Come on...
No
I'm too nervous
Check it for me, Hairy
Alright
Step aside!
Go...
Stop him! Don't let him get away
McDaddy!
I like talking to you
unlike your thugs
All they do is ftght
Know why I like to borrow from you?
You have compassion, sympathy
and a conscience
Am I right?
And you are smart, too
I'll repay your $100,000 loan
in 100 installments, OK?
It's a deal
I hate smooth talkers
I have a living to make
Don't come over
I was just kidding, McDaddy
You think this is funny?
Don't make mejump
Go ahead
Are you serious?
Jump!
You don't want me dead, do you?
No, but you brought it upon yourself
Get a camera and take a picture
Yes, Boss
If I die, you'll kiss your money goodbye
It won't do us any good
No, I think it's brilliant
I've got so much bad debts lately
This will show the others
Go ahead, jump
No, McDaddy
No?
Let's see...
No?
So you can read my mind?
I'm safe!
Come on! Come after me!
You!
Take this!
I'll get you, Thongs
What are you doing, pal?
Fixing the air-conditioning
It's OK, go back in
Look, Boss! Cops!
Here they come
Go!
Thongs
Inspector Mok
Sorry, I didn't see you
You say that every time
You missed the alumni gathering
Alumni?
Nobody called me No?
No!
Grade school or high school?
Grade school
Here, you know the drill
Is this really necessary?
No need to leap oft a building over a card game
I told you to quit gambling
I hate bailing you out in the middle of the night
You can't count on me much longer
I've decided to retire
Retirement? You're kidding!
You know my wife is losing her mind
and she's getting worse
Last week she grabbed someone's baby
and refused to return it
She even bit the mother's hand
She's getting worse, understand?
If I carry on with you two
We'll all end up in jail sooner or later
Who'll take care of her then?
That was 20 years ago
You keep saying that!
I'm still responsible for what happened
What kind of father was I?
My son had high feverfor 2 days
I didn't realise it was meningitis
I'm responsible for his death
We have no children. There is no hope
What else can I do?
Have another one
I can get Viagra at half price
OK?
Don't provoke him any more
Don't tell me what to do
It's time...
Straighten your shirt
Honey, you're late!
No, I'm not
You were at the top of the stairs yesterday
Now you're only on the third,
you don't love me anymore?
I'll hurry tomorrow
I love you very much
Your son
Hey! Did you pay your rent?
Of course! Ask him
They did
They're always sneaking around
What's the matter with them?
Don't hang out with them anymore
What? She knows about us?
We must do something about that
You're more capable than my Dad
I am not even ftt to tie his shoelaces
He's one of the richest men in Asia
If I'm half the man he is it'd be wonderful
Dad will like you very much
I'm sure I'll like him very much too
and you, of course
Is my English getting better?
I need to grab a cigarfrom the car
Enjoy your dinner
Yan...
Keep an eye on her
Stop right there!
What the hell?
What's wrong with you?
You can't come here dressed as a chicken!
Think with your head if you want to spy on me
Forget it, I want a divorce
I'm working
I know that.
You'd better not be doing this forfun
I came because Fanny told me she saw you
Who's that inside?
Obviously she's a woman
My clients are either men or women
Can I only have male clients?
Divorce me if you don't trust me
You haven't been home for months, I miss you
Why?
I was stupid enough to marry you at 18
Look at this mess
I can't breathe
Never mind, let's divorce
I'm sorry
Sorry for what? You have done me no wrong
Just feel sorry for yourself
Go back to school if you have time
If you know any better
You won't be dressed like this
What's the key to a marriage?
Trust
Space
You're suftocating me
I want a divorce
I can't
I'm pregnant
What?
Come again?
I'm pregnant
No way! When was the last time...
You were drunk that night and forgot to put on...
How could you?
You should have kicked me out of bed
I am ignorant about birth control
Really!
You know how I am with kids
I don't like them. If we have a child
We'll have no more privacy
Are you sure? Have you checked?
You can't be more than 3 months pregnant
Don't waste any time
Get an abortion in Shenzhen
You can't afford to wait
I love you!
Hurry!
You can't walk to Shenzhen dressed like that
Take a bus
Go back inside...
Tell me where is Thongs
He's dead
Don't get upset, mind your health
The usual...
Spray paint and take some pictures
Shut the door and windows while you eat, OK?
Don't be mad
Sorry about that
Hey, Thongs Stay away from him
Came to visit yourfather? Yes
He's a disgrace to the village, ignore him
PAY UP!
Please move along, lady
Easy...
Hurry...
What's going on?
Just leave my family alone
But you were in hiding, pal
How else can we find you?
What are you doing?
Hold on tight!
I'll pay when I can
I'll kill you if you bother my family again
Help him up
What's the occasion?
Everyone is here
Twins
Look how tall you are, Ting!
Come, I brought presents
These are all for you
Take what you like
This is for you
This is for you
Here's the pillow you wanted
and your heater
This is for you, Dad
A massager to ease your back pains
Why did you come back?
I thought you were dead
Stop cursing me like that, Dad
Look at you, a punk!
You were not like this when you were born
I wanted you to be a doctor or lawyer
I sent you to the best schools
But you turned out to be a loser
I may not be a lawyer, but I'm still your son
I wanted to be a professional, too
Even the President, but I'm not cut out for it
Your mother and I
saved up every dime
to put you through school
I tried, I just can't do it
Don't be so stubborn
Me? Stubborn?
I'm doing alright. Look at me
The hell you are
What have you been doing?
Gambling!
I'm a business man
Business? What business?
Whoring and gambling? You're a crook
You're nothing but a cheat
All you want is for me to make money
Don't start...
I'm making money now
I bought you everything you wanted
What's wrong with that? I earned every penny
Money isn't everything
I want you to be an honest man
I did nothing wrong
I don't know... what have I done?
What did I do wrong?
I wonder about these things
How and where you got them from
You probably stole them!
Take them away!
Out!
Dad...
Here, throw this away as well
Get out!
You'd better go You're not my son
I don't have an unworthy son like you
Nobody wants to see you
Take them away!
PAY UP!
Honey!
What is it, Honey?
Is this our bedroom?
Yes, of course.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's our bedroom
We've been robbed!
What?
There's been a burglary!
Goddamn it, who did this?
It's OK, Honey
At least our baby is safe
I'll clean up this mess, OK?
A burglary!
Landlord
What is it, Uncle?
I heard you're retiring. Made enough already?
I have a big one for you, interested?
I never said I'm retiring. I'll take any job
Meet for a card game, Thongs
22:00, the usual place
Don't buy a car if you can't afford it
I was just kidding
This is for your troubles
You always make me do this
Stop being agitated No
Treat yourself to a massage No!
Come on... take it No!
Be like that, you goddamn midget!
You'll be towing cars for the rest of your life
and you'll have a midget son like you!
Did you crack my refrigerator, Octopus?
Is Thongs coming? What time is it?
There's a big job, I can't decide
I feel we should...
Been painting again?
Must you always wear white?
Did you crack my refrigerator?
Why are you so upset? The paint is on me!
You should see what I did to those thugs
What were you saying?
We have an assignment
I can't make up my mind
I'll do anything
This is really complicated
Though we'll be paid $77 million...
What? What?
$7 million? $7 million? To do what?
Just hear me out...
Out the crap, let's do it
Listen to me...
I'll do anything for $77 million
$7 million, you've got to be kidding!
Start the car... Mind the door!
Watch where you're going
Help me
Landlord...
Give me a hand
You don't have to come with us
I must do this myself
Why is this such a big deal?
Never mind
Just open the door for me, I'll wait down here
Nothing! I bet they wore the jewellery
Just some foreign currency left
You're kidding...
Where's Landlord?
Probably cracking another safe
What a small world!
What's going on?
What are you doing?
Are you mad?
Just taking him back to his grandpa
Whose grandpa?
Shut up!
What? You lied to me too?
What did you feed him?
What is it?
There's a break-in!
Uncle, it's done
Is it Lobster Bay?
Roger that
Do you know what you're doing?
We agreed no raping, looting
arson and murder
This is someone else's family feud, stay out
We take the baby to his Grandpa
All it takes is 15 minutes for a blood test
What did you feed him? Nothing
Just sedative to help him sleep
Are you crazy?
You fed sedative to a baby!
Even burglars have ethics
You taught us that, remember?
Ethics is for reference only
We need to improvise all the time
You should've told us thejob involves a baby
I told you we need to talk
but once you heard about the $77 million
you pushed me into the car
and you even congratulated me
You didn't give me a chance
No way
What are you doing?
Take him back How can you say that?
I dare you to repeat that!
Take him back!
Who supported you all these years?
Who supported you all these years?
Who taught you to pick a lock?
And who taught you to crack a safe?
What will become of you without me?
You're nothing but a loser
And you, a womanizer
I'm sorry... do you know what happened to me?
Do you have any idea?
You know my wife is nuts
And I can barely see these days
I'm going blind. Do you understand?
Know why I had to do this myself?
Why must I do this?
Use your imagination
Rings any bell?
I've been robbed!
Some bastards cleaned out my $3 million!
I have nothing left...
Who'll support me?
Will you do it?
Can you support me?
Even I get burgled
I'm supposed to be a pro. Now I have nothing!
I can manage on my own
I know I can!
I don't need your help
Landlord
Get in
Let's go home and get some sleep
If I wasn't driving this piece of shit
You'll be eating my dust
Get out of the way, asshole!
If I let you overtake me in that car
I'm a real son of a bitch
Stop this nonsense! Careful with the kid
Are you crazy? Let him pass
Hello? Uncle?
Are you there yet?
Almost, and you?
5 more minutes
Some asshole is blocking the road
We're dueling with an asshole too
Don't be late, the buyer is punctual
No problem
Be careful and lose that asshole quick
Don't worry
I'm not nicknamed King of Monza for nothing
See you there!

The others can go to hell
Listen, only the kid!
Yes, Boss

A month... no, a week
A week?
That'll kill him
Stop! Landlady...
Baby! Landlady!
Landlord is having fondue

A week! My God...
It's not on!
Quiet...
Again?
What now?
Are you out of your mind?
What are you doing?
It stinks!
I don't believe this
He didn't even have much to eat
Don't shove it to me! There's shit everywhere
Eat this, come on...

Don't feed him just anything
How old is he?
How old? Yes!
How old?
5 to 6 months, I can tell
Who's the father?
He is
I see...
I know your kind
Yes, that's what we are
Don't worry, I have nothing against your kind
But men are so careless
Not this!
This is for 3 year-olds
No, this one doesn't have DHA
This is extra large!
His pee will leak from the side
No!
This is for breast enlargement
I need that, he wants a betterfeel
Don't complicate matters, just hurry!
Life is complicated

You must take this seriously

How old is he?
A few months, I think
A few months? He's big
Where's his mother?
At work
You look after him alone?
That's wonderful!
So cute and loveable
We could have caught a taxi if you'd hurried
Shut up, alright?
What a coincidence!
You just got oft?
No, I work at the hospital
This isjust part time
Chatting her up?
She was our instructor
What a cute baby!
Excuse me!
Where are you?

Where is the poodle?
Oh my God!
It's the wrong bus!
Sorry...
Picture perfect! Give me a kiss!
It's yourfault!
Are you alright?
Thanks
Don't hold him like that
Careful with his arm!
You'rejust plain negligent!
Leaving him behind on the bus
Can you help me?
Octopus!
I don't believe this!
How can he miss out by a whisker?
I should have known better
I lose money on him every time
I do the dishes, you take a bath
Let's take a bath together, OK?
I'm rich!
I've won, at last
Isn't it fun?
Hey!

Thanks so much, Melody
If not for you
We wouldn't know what to do with him
Octopus and I are grateful
Actually, I'm very grateful...
So that's how he was revived
Yan...
Did you do what I told you to do?
You don't have to go if you're busy
Should I call her?
Was I too harsh?
This is Yan, I can't come to the phone right now
Leave a message at the beep
Alan!
Long time no see, Thongs
Your baby?
Hey, stop it!
Carry on...
Come...
Be a good boy!
Don't do that!
Thongs, what's your game?
Get out if you're not playing!
Don't bring a kid in here!
Get lost!
Life is complicated, you are what you eat
What you feed and teach stay with him for life
You must take this seriously
Thongs, are you in or not?
Go home and babysit!
Get lost!
I'm not playing
Loser!
Cleaned out already?
No, he was crying too much
Yes, that's a good boy
How aboutjust one bet?
Just one?
No more gambling
I quit...
You're worse than my Dad!
I really don't know
I've been calling Landlord all night
I'm a man of my word
I'll fix it for you
I just want the boy!
Let me out...
Is this a joke?
Landlord has 2 partners in crime
Thongs and Octopus
Let me out!
Thongs and Octopus
I don't care what you do, ftnd them
I found them, Boss. They're inside
Very good! Now we change the diaper
Are you Thongs?
Give me the baby
What baby? Don't play dumb
I don't know any Uncles
Don't play dumb with me
What is it?
They're looking for Baby
My name is Baby, looking for me?
Damn! You're asking for it!
Go!
What's the matter with you?
Nothing, I just overjumped
What did they say?
Who cares? Let's go
Remember? Yes
Ring the bell, when he opens the door...
I'll splash the paint on your cue
Let him have it!
Yes
Wait!
Thongs, don't hide behind women and babies
I won't spare you!
I don't understand a word you're saying
Thongs is my buddy
He's not here right now, come back later
No problem, we'll wait for him inside
He's my kid brother
Nice to meet you
There's no one here
Fanny, I'm scared
Is it worse than abortion?
Ask him about the future?
Confront him with the ultrasound
Be good
Who are you looking for?
Octopus
He is not here, come back later
You'd better come in ftrst
Thongs
Make sure the baby is home
What's that look on your face?
Toothache
Why is Octopus oft in such a hurry?
He needs to use the toilet
You live here? Yes
I love to come up for a chat
Steve!
Octopus! Thongs...
You've ftnally shown up!
I'm tired of leaving messages on you voicemail
Leave! I'll tend to you later
Come here...
Where's the baby?
In your room. Who are they?
Decorators
My ftat is a mess
What's with the paint?
We're renovating, just trying out the colors
What is it, Yan?
Oh, no!
Talk to the ofticer
What is it, Miss?
Thongs...
The police can help you with any problem
There's a cop in there! Go to the roof
Sit down and tell me your problem
Meet my good friend
Inspector Steve Mok
He's my... cousin
He's my... other cousin
We came to show him...
the color sample
Yourface...
I'm into body art
What's with all the baby stuff?
You know my pal Octopus...
He's a born womanizer
He got someone pregnant
Can't do much about that
Where is he now?
In the toilet
I need to go too
You do?
I'm investigating a break-in
Know anything about it?
I've quit long time ago
Octopus, Inspector wants to have a word
Hurry up
Octopus...
What took you so long?
You're here?
Your turn
Not after him, it stinks in there
You have a friend in there
Friend?
He's my cousin too
I'm the eldest
Then let's reminisce
Never met each other?
Of course they have
Take care of this, Octopus
Why are you still here? I want a divorce!
What the hell is this?
Never mind, I want a divorce
You...
And you...
It sounds complicated
Yes, very complicated
Thongs, we've been friends for so long
I didn't know you have cousins of difterent races
My Dad was a sailor...
He must have stopped in India
That'll make him your brother
That's not right
