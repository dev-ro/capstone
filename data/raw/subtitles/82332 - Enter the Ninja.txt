Well done, you've passed
for all tests.
This parchment is your diploma
as Master in Ninjitsu.
It contains the wisdom of all Ninja
previous generations.
For years you will add your knowledge to this parchment...
and pass it on to your best student.
The new Ninja Compai.
You did not drink it, Hasegawa?
He's not a Ninja.
He acquired the right...
-No.
Say nothing more.
-Let Him speak, Master Komori.
My ancestors were samurai
from Iga, one noble family.
Cole came all the way from overseas.
He is a Ninja.
He is not a Ninja.
Do you stay long in the Philippines?
-I Go visit a friend.
Then I pull back further.
Wherever you are, you own.
It is easy to get wrong.
Hasegawa is bitter and frustrated.
I'm sorry what happened yesterday
.
Master, why is he
so frustrated?
It's now the 20th century.
In Japan there is no samurai,
no Ninja.
Previously Hasegawa would have been a great warrior
.
You were a good teacher, Master
Komori.
Cole, be strong in order to avoid
bitterness.
Use your power just to help the weak.
I will do my best.
Halt. Stand still.
Put that bag down.
Find something?
Cole, you old bastard, how you doin '.
Withers.
That's my wife.
Pleasant.
How are you, my war comrade.
To drink something?
Like something cold and wet.
Do you drink now?
You're just in.
I have not it, I will.
I should have said that Cole came
. He's an old friend.
What a way to wake
.
How's married life?
-Two Years of enjoyment.
Receives your friends they always like this?
-Always.
No, I do not drink alcohol.

-Yes Please.
Suppose you will eat?
-Have I the choice?
Frank, show your friend where he

It's good for digestion.
What were you doing in Japan?
Study Geishas?
He certainly learned Kung Fu. -There
I do not believe that.
I'm sorry that I hurt you.
It was no Kung Fu.
What 't was also
give Mary Ann a few lessons.
Why not...
She has a lot of spunk, huh?
Why I love her.
Thank you...
What is your problem?
Problem -What do you mean?
You sent one telegram.
I have not seen you for so long
and I missed you.
Come on in here, you only send a telegram
if you have problems.
'T Go to the land, Cole.
They want 't take away from us.
Why, decrease?
They want us' t sell.
Sales  't at a profit.
-I Can not do that.
Mary Ann loves it...
it's her life.
Sales  't not.
That's the problem.
They do not accept refusal.
Who are "they"?
I mingle among the workers like me
Pee Wee, this is my friend Cole.
He stays a while.
I will organize a cockfight?
We're going to win.

I take you about half an hour.
Good day.

or are you one religious?
Gold...
I have an offer.
This is cheaper for dollars.
What is all this?
I now have the money.
For information I demand money.
But this is free.
He called the Hook.
When he had two hands,
was it a real bastard.
Now he is even worse.
Thanks.
You're a nice man.
The problem is solved.
But if you're at're too late...
The next time pay on time
.
Let them.
Businessmen?
-Absolutely.
For me he will too.
Viel but he's on his mouth.
And what do you think of our city?

were whole families.
Too bad...
How long has Frank been like this?
That Drink?
Since the trouble started.
It's here
become a haven for criminals.
Maybe 't care
him more, but I think so.
I think it's fine here.

Because I am very stubborn.
-That I noticed.

Have you changed your mind?
I'm talking watch yet.

Certainly stolen from a corpse.
Search for your wife occasionally?
-Where?
Money always talks.

I thought we were talking about?
Frank... No, he can handle them.
Let them feel it. Yes, that's m

Unfortunately for your friends.
Just be more careful with that thing
.
It is stainless steel, Frank.
Come out here,
we need to find workers.
Stay still hanging around,
I come back.
Wait for me.
Hello, girls.
The amount should exceed 37 million
Euro-dollars.
Awaiting your reply...
Mr. Venarius wants copies to
Frankfurt, Zurich and Sao Paulo.
Were my conclusions about the Landers country right?
Full. The oil
potential is incredible.
Mr. Parker, hopefully
Siegfried good news for us.
Do you have good news for Mr.
Venarius, Siegfried?
Not exactly... Mr. Venarius. You see...
Do not speak directly to Mr. Venarius.
Mr. Parker, looking out once or
Siegfried understands our problem.
Do not speak against him.
Mr. Parker, I'm still
a logical person?
Right, gentlemen?
-Everyone Knows that.
Why is such a simple thing
not settled?
Frank Landers
refuses to sell his land, Mr. Venarius.
Mr. Parker.
Mr. Glickman...
Is Siegfried still in our service?
Yes, he's on the payroll.
Tell me Siegfried,
What is the difficulty?
The difficulty is a stranger.
-Who?
A friend of Frank Landers.
Over him then.
That's... not so simple.
Not so simple?
I need more people...
better.
That friend of Mr. Landers
is very difficult.
We need Landers' ground
. What do you need?
More men.
-Well, You get it.
But this time...
I choose them myself before you.
Hello, Mr. Venarius,
Mr. Parker...
We will find the right men
for this job.
But beware,
some are unreliable.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Mr. Venarius is happy to see you.
Unfortunately we can not use
all...
We find ten good men...
real professionals.
Who thinks to be suitable for
?
I am pleased to see so many good men.

Do you find him?
I find him just a fat guy.
And what's your name?

Fatso, on your knees and pray.
Hook you off?
How many good guys do I have?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Mr. Parker...
To save time, you should form
pairs.
Decide who is going to work for us.
Find out about the man at
Landers.
Make sure you get to know everything.
Why are you not playing?
I have one year
not been on a horse.
I do nothing more.
I sat on my ass,
as you fought for me.
I've lost it.
What 't was also, I lost it.
Africa And then, Frank?
Africa?
That was 100 years ago, Cole.
I get something to drink.
You'll be t, however, buddy...
calmly.
Boss, we're back.
Pee Wee.
And my winning rooster is back.
And Mary is back.
Good to see you all again.
We hold a cockfight.
This way, everyone. Form a circle.
Come on.
Do not panic. Stay here.
Do you hear me? Stay here.
Mr. Landers...
Your workers ignored the requirement
of the union.
They are not a trade unionist.
Then I will organize it for them
.
'T
Only what you do with those guys disappear.
You could not come back.
Now I'm going to teach you a lesson.
Let him alone.
Let go of my arm,
you break him.
Withers.
You're forgetting something...
You'll hear from me.
What do you think of my
masterpiece, Siegfried?
What Mr. Venarius?
My living mobile.
-What?
Those in the pool, imbecile.
This is an extraordinary masterpiece, Mr. Venarius.
Oh... I do not feel
in shape today.
That's so...
Mr. Parker, I need to rest.
How's with Landers?
-He Needs more people.
What he did with those guys
I'm giving?
I did nothing,
but he did it.
One man?
Are we afraid of one man?
Yes, he is like an army.
Let us army itself
but recruit.
It is very difficult.
Tell him that.
Mr. Parker, I'm very tired.
Say bag
that he no longer works for us.
Thank you, Mr. Venarius.
Mr. Parker... please...

Wait. Not too fast.
As in Angola, huh?
I had him pick...
Here it is.
Where are you taking me?
-That Brand you by yourself.
You get three count to

Take him along.
Should I wait?
Do that.
No, only Mr. Landers.

Can you handle this?
Do you go upstairs and watch.
Try for time.
Mr. Landers.
I'm glad you could come.

I missed my father when he was alive.
He never had time for me.
That's why I do not want kids.
And Mary Ann?
No idea.
We have never talked about it.
Do not get me wrong...
She is very sexy,
they always will.
But lately I can not get it up anymore.
She deserves more than that...
Do not you think?
Tonight we were great.
You know what I want now?
Be Drunk.
I feel great.
I slept like a baby tonight.
A few brawls
and I'm back in shape.
Did you see to the left of me?
I wiped the floor with him on.
I feel strong.
What was that guy in the Congo again? That bastard!
Remember how we
floored him?
Do you sometimes do not get tired
yourself? I do.
What did you, Mary Ann?
Poor sleep last night?
Would someone tennis?
He sided 20 men out of the way?
Impossible.
He switched them all off.
-Deed One man it?
No ordinary man, sir,
a Ninja.
A what?
Someone who learned Ninjitsu.
I looked it up.
Ninjitsu: the ancient Japanese art of
deaths. Assassins.
Ridiculous. This is the 20th century
in Manila, not Japan.
But we still have to deal with a disciplined man...
perfect in martial arts,
fencing, archery.
Knowledgeable people.
-Bestaan Who are now in Japan?
They are now a teacher, doctor, lawyer...
They use that power now only for self discipline.
And Ninja works for
Landers?
I want a Ninja.
Search Ninja
still believe in the old traditions.
Then I have to go to Japan.
What are you doing still here?
I have everything:
Opera singers, acrobats,
what you want.
You understand me apparently.
Of course. You want
acrobatic swordsmen.
Not exactly,
but you're hot.
I know a very good man.
He made five films
Mr. Kurusara.
He played a samurai.
And also starred with Robert Mitchum.
He can ride, he is
the best swordsman in Japan.
Mr. Mesuda,

A true Ninja.
Oh, that...
No more
Ninjas in Japan.
Ninjas were one hundred years ago.
I want to be a Ninja.
A professional Ninja.
You want Ninja...
I care for Ninja.
What you desire is quite
a good thing?
Certainly, Master Komori.
We have problems with violence in our town.
We need help.
Then I'm the right guy for you
.
Hasegawa.
Gentlemen...
Excellent.
Gentlemen, now I represent
Ninja Hasegawa as impresario.
Who sent you?
Who.
-Charles Venarius.
Why?
-That He said.
Where can I find him?
The penthouse, Rawhouse Boulevard 814.
Give him a message through.
I do not like to be followed
.
Never mind, I tell 't' m
myself.
Mr. Parker speaks highly of you.
Thank you, sir.
When you carry out your mission?
-Immediately, Sir.
And if you fail?
-Then I wish to die.
Interesting you for your art?
Not bad.
Come on guys, I have a beautiful
offer for you.
Maybe we can use.
What a weird office.
I would like to take one dip.
That guy must be very rich.
But he has a bad
taste for paintings.
'T Strangest office
I ever saw.
I'm looking for the vault.
I used cracker.
Now I know why Venarius
Franks country wants.
According to the geological report is worth a fortune.
Oil.
Look at, they have porn.
Hopefully I have not seen these
.
What is that?
Watch that guy
well with bow and arrow.
Is this real?
'T Seems like an action movie.
Jesus, this guy is a common
secretions.
Hasegawa.
-Who?
What is this fellow?
Someone that I was at school in Japan.
Where is Cole?
-To Manila, I think.
You can contrive to, huh?
Yes, very much.
It's a huge guy, huh?
Is there anything, Frank?
When we were here only,
we had a small table.
We sat on top of each other,
now you're miles away.
Know...
Shaved You look much better.
'T You look good.
-Will I leave my mustache?
Sometimes I wake in the morning wake up...
and then I look at that guy
in the mirror and I say:
'What are you doing with your life
?
He never answers.
I think you're too hard on yourself.
That's not necessary.
Maybe I need it.
Come on, Frank.
I don 't just do not,
Mary Ann.
Caution.
-It's All right, Frank.
Mary Ann, waiting
guards.
Guards?

Why do not you work for me?
I have a job available.

indebted to Frank.
Will you write me?
I'll be back.
Example, and who are you going to kill again
, Ninja?
Friend, a real Ninja does not kill...
he turns someone just out of self-defense.
Are you looking for a porter?
But there are exceptions.
