Mr Brown, please let me introduce myself.
Andre Bertiere.
I'm Lord Rashley's personal assistant.
At last, dear Walter! 
Edouard is expecting you.
Come in!
My dear friend!
 So glad to see you!
Come in and make yourself at home.
 You and I go back a long way.
At Oxford, remember?
 As if it were yesterday.
Alas, time goes on.
I didn't even realize.
 My assistant reminded me.
The boy is priceless - reliable and thourough.
 And loyal, too.
Soon your husband's going to take out
 a life policy with you as a beneficiary.
Should the worst happen, 
 you'll get the full payout immediately.
The poor thing! Let him rest in peace...
As soon as possible!
Now tell me what brought you here.
On my table there's the life policy
 you have sent me.
I had a good read; it all seems
 clear and legal.
Except for paragraph 6 - 
 I need your advice on that one.
The policy covers all types of natutal
 or accidental death
under any condition and in any country.
But it does not cover murder or suicide.
Walter, this is no time to play games.
I want it clearly stated that 
the policy will be paid out
even if there is murder.
Walter, please accept that
 we are too old to make such jokes.
And you, Lord Rashley
 please understand
that Fantomas has never been one to joke.
Fantomas?
Don't worry, I have no desire
 to get rid of you just yet.
Oh? Thank you!
 - Well, not at this time, anyway.
Everything'll depend on you.
You are one of the richest people in the world.
You exaggerate! 
 - Why the modesty? I hate hypocrites!
I, on the other hand, am proud to be
 the most famous criminal.
In order to discuss certain business venture with you
 I had to pretend
I was your friend Walter Brown.
This face is the perfect mask.
 Even you were fooled.
But it is necessary I reminded you
 of certain events.
Two years ago, pretending I was the 
journalist Fandor, I disapeared
in the clouds, and took with me jewellery
 worth a billion francs.
Here I carried out an armed robbery
 wearing the mask of Commissaire Juva.
Another escape - this time in a minisubmarine.
Next you'll see my secret laboratory.
There I prepare the means
 to carry out the destruction of this planet
before I move to another one.
This time I won't take my flying car with me -
 I'm bored with that one.
Don't worry, I'm not about to destroy
 the world just yet.
I just want to pillage for a bit longer.
Some people will lay the golden eggs for me.
- I don't understand...
I follow the rule that was created
 in different times.
Let the rich pay.
If they want to go on living, 
 they will pay me a tax.
What?
Don't you think your life is in my hands?
You're not slow!
I've set up a company that will 
 collect fees
from the wealthiest people. 
A Life Tax.
Here, an application form.
 Just sign it.
Of course I am flexible.
You can pay annually or biannually.
It's up to you.
But shorter terms are not practical
so the fees for that would have to be higher.
Considering you're in great health
 both personally and financially
the best way would be to pay it all at once.
All at once?
 - 3 billion francs, or 6 million dollars.
Such a tiny sum, and you'll be rid of Fantomas for good.
6 million dollars is an awful lot of money!
 -Not at today's inflated prices.
You'll have one month to pay.
If you don't pay on time, 
the price goes up by 10 percent.
Every day.
By 600 thousand? 
-Yes; dollars.
And if you are a month late
I'd have to send you the last notice
 before the execution.
Execution? 
- Yes.
And if you tell anyone about this, 
 the execution 
takes place immediately.
Soon you'll get a letter advising you 
of how and where to pay.
What's going on?
 - I'm getting picked up.
I'll leave my little toy here
 in case you get bored.
You don't have to come out with me.
Good bye, my friend.
Walter!
Darling, tell me what I should put on page 3.
It's starting again! Fantomas!
 You really are exaggerating!
I'm not. He killed Walter Brown.
 - There's no proof of that.
Mainly I don't like the header: 
"Fantomas in Scotland".
At least once a year that monster
 harasses us.
I've the title for another article: 
"LochNess Monster - Fantomas"
I'll fix your airfares.
 You'll get better ideas once you're there.
Yes, my lord.
I'm certain Fantomas is 
behind this.
My lord, I'm confused, yes.
I'm honoured to have been invited 
to your family home.
Your assistant is also invited, Commissar.
My assistant? 
Yes, my lord.
I speak good French.
 I studied in Paris.
Very well, my lord. I'm off.
 Do nothing; wait for me.
I'm responsible for your safety.
 Say nothing to anyone.
I'll arrive incognito. 
 He won't get away this time!
I'm expecting you, Commissar. 
 Good bye, my Lord, yes!
-This is the one.
-Thank you. Yes?
-Pleased to meet you, Commmissar.
-Same here; but who are you?
I'm glad we're going to spend 
several days in Scotland together.
-So am I, sir. But who's that?
-Fantomas. Have a nice trip.
See you soon.
What? 
 - That was Fantomas!
-Fantomas? 
 Don't yo know that monster+
Gentlemen, I have resolved to invite you
to this important meeting
because you belong to some 
of the world's richest families,
and because Fantomas has placed 
 a tax on your right to live.
It's a very high tax...
The Maharaja from Kimpore wants to speak!
Matuga la plavenzentu Fantomasi!
Dochoncem slastichvod pracet
hoj kolnich sves brilantis Fantomaso.
His Excellency says he is 
Fantomas's biggest victim.
Each year he must hand over 
as many diamonds as his body weight.
I can recommend to His Excellency
a wonderful masseur.
With his help he'll lose up to 20 kilos a year.
Richard, we do appreciate
humour in normal times.
But the situation today is beyond joking.
Have you forgotten that our Walter Brown
was murdered by that monster?
Our greatest sympathies go to His Excellency.
Molitabjo! Kosolpe kalofo doja,
sulko mjelo biceva!
Maharaja is quoting from one of our thinkers
"The lightning will strike
but spring's rains will bring out the blossoms.
Great. And educational.
Gentlemen, we have all been forced 
to sign this declaration.
He even sent me a payment form. 
Yeah, me too.
I never feared even the mother-in-law.
So Fantomas does not scare me.
-Perhaps you'll die before you get a fright.
I'd still like to leave.
But I have to tell you 
you're in mortal danger.
Maybe. Good luck, gentlemen.
What are we going to do?
We'll try to trap Fantomas in my castle.
Commissar Jube will lead the investigation
and he as well
as his fiancee wil be our guests.
With their help we'll trap them.
Fantomas will soon turn up in my house
pursuing them.
Then we'll strike and 
rid the world of this monster.
Such beatiful flowers!
How nice of you!
It's not for you, sir.
Commissar. I'm Andre Bertiere
personal assistant of Lord Rashley.
Follow me.
-Is this Loch Ness?
We'll get there soon, my lady.
Does Lord Rashley know
how has it all happened?
No, he stopped for a drink with his 
friend Brown and can't remember anything.
-They drugged his drink!
-Or he got sick.
Don't interrupt my investigation!
We'll likely to hit fog soon.
I'll take the forest road.
It's a bit narrower, but we'll get there sooner.
The old timers don't like this road.
It's called "The three favourites'"
-And why?
It's said that three travellers
that went this way were find dead.
-Lucky there's five of us"
Hit the brakes!
Wait!
Get into it!
We can't lift that, Commissar.
It's too heavy.
Why can't we by pass?
The wagon would sink.
Well, I'll be! The tree was cut!
Come have a look!
Impossible!
Have a look, then! It's sabotage!
Look at that stump! 
 Someone wanted to kill us!
Look over there. 
 Someone's coming.
Who's that?
I don't know, but perhaps he'll help us.
That's Godfrey.
Who's Godfrey?
Glad to see you, Godfrey!
You'll give us a lift to the castle, won't you?
Can you handle this cart?
-Sure!
Let's push, gentlemen!
Turn right; OK - push!
The worst is over.
Get in!
I'll go in front.
We'll travel like in a cab!
Now get going, Godfrey!
I see you're alone, Elizabeth.
Let me offer you some Scotch.
Good evening!
Excuse me...
Of course. Take a seat, my friend!
Welcome, dear.
Have a good time!
The colonel is a good story teller.
Excuse me, my lady - Inspector Smith.
-Good evening!
If you wanted to play bridge...
Good evening and welcome.
They laugh at us?
--Who?
Everyone? -- Why
--You dressed us up!
That was a great joke with the skirt!
I assure you the kilt is an important 
part of the Scotsman's attire!
But the smoking is part of the international norm.
Leave me alone.
It's an amazing world, where evil battles good all the time.
...and evil often battles itself.
The powers of good and evil?
Yes, Commissar. Fantomas must be from a different world.
You think Fantomas is a Martian?
Are the French terrestrials?
I'm talking about a different world. 
I mean the other world.
You don't believe in the supernatural?
I have not thought of that.
We're surrounded by invisible beings
who can at any time decide whether we live or not.
Decide about our death?
--Dorothy's right.
We are surrounded by mysteries.
I believe this question interests you.
I did a report on the castle
that was haunted.
Unfortunately all the photos were unclear.
That was the ghosts' revenge.
They don't like photographs.
Is your castle also haunted?
Fandore, do you see the ghosts?
I am prepared to believe in their existence.
Journalists are curious.
I'd like to meet some ghosts.
You'll have an opportunity, Albert.
Please, bring a table.
For 4 people? -- No, for 7.
--At your service.
Why do you need it?
I believe your wife wants to invite you
to a spiritual seance.
That is against logic!
You have piercing eyes, Commissar!
You'll make a great medium!~
Fandor's eyes are also interesting.
Don't you think?
You're exactly right.
The table's ready.
--Thank you. Let's start.
I'd go to the end of the world with you.
Can you feel the fluidum?
--Of course!
That's a good sign. I expected it. 
Mr Juve, come here!
We'll call Walter Brown.
Fantomas's victim.
I am sorry madam, but I have not
come to talk to dead people.
Commissar, Walter knows
who killed him, and he'll tell us.
This is a new method,
never before used by the police.
Instead of interrogating perpetrators,
you'll talk to their dead victims.
I can see right into
your soul.
You'll sit me at the desk 
and suddenly a lighning will strike
and tomorrow my picture will be
on the front pages with the title
"When he can't find the criminal,
Commissar Juve talks to ghosts.".
-But you can see I have no equipment.
-I will not allow some spook
to conduct my investigation.
I have the honour to act
on behalf of the British police.
-I'd like to make a comment.
-I know - you want to say,
that the French methods
are outdated. Fine.
That the police force employs
retards; fine.
And that you are the most
cool-headed person here.
But I had no idea Scotland Yard
interrogates furniture these days.
Is it really easier to make tables
talk than the criminal?
At least there's no risk involved.
In England ghosts, just like policemen
are unarmed.
-I would not want to be laughed at.
-The French are such gallant people,
that to entertain a pretty lady
they make themselves look ridiculous.
-Commissar, stop being difficult.
-Sit down.
Elizabeth, sit in front of me.
Place your hands under the table
and stretch your fingers wide.
You must touch the next person
with your little fingers.
Concentrate.
Don't be nervous, Commissar.
Put your hand next to mine.
Don't be afraid. It's just the storm.
It's hit the power lines.
The voice of the netherworld's been heard.
A good sign. Concentrate.
Walter is sending a sign.
He's coming.
I feel he's about to turn up.
Walter, are you here?
Answer me. Who killed you?
Fantomas?
What's happening? Walter, are you here?
Any doubters here?
Somebody does not believe in him.
Is it my neighbour on the left?
Not him.
Is it my neighbour on the right?
-Commissar, you're the unbeliever!
-So what can I do?
Because of you, Walter refuses
to turn up.
Well, if that's the case,
then excuse me, please.
-Such an embarrassment!
-What are you doing, you bastard?
-Are you Walter?
-No, sir. Albert.
I am to look after the Commissar.
I'm the butler.
Let me show you your room.
I'll bring some light.
-Tell me, Walter...
-Albert.
-Right. Is this a common affliction?
-What is?
-Those spiritual seances.
-Almost every evening.
Last week we managed 
to talk with the Duke of Wellington.
-Aren't they...
-I don't understand.
You don't. Let's go, then.
Careful, Commissar.
The steps are narrow.
This castle is full of memories.
So many mysterious, romantic events
have happened here since the Crusades,
and lots of terrible things, too.
To this day these old rocks 
speak of the past.
Look!
-That's Murdoch.
-Murdoch?
-Sir Murdoch McRashley.
-And why is he playing ghost?
Sir Murdoch McRashley died during 
the first Crusade.
-Fairy tales.
-Not at all, Commissar.
-Watch the step.
-Where?
You see? It was there. Would you 
allow me to curtsy?
-Sure, Albert. 
-You look good in a kilt.
-Is it worn all the time?
-Definitely..
One should only wear the kilt 
to all big events in Scotland.
-And my assistant told me the opposite!
-Of course, traditions are disappearing.
It's so...modern to see men
wearing pants...
Albert, I won't get lost here.
I can find the room.
-It's the last door.
-Thanks- -
The last warning before
execution.
Alarm!
Help!
Someone's hung in my room!
Quickly!
Help, quick!
A hanged man in my room!
-Terrible! In my room...
-No - in my room.
Shocking!
Hullo! Alarm!
A hanged man in my room!
Look!
Stop it! Walter talked to you,
and you frightened him!
But that's unimportant now.
A hanged man's in my room!
It's horrible. Come, quick.
You'll see, it's terrible.
Everyone follow me!
Shocking sight. You'll see.
Watch the step.
Thank you, Commissar.
Where's the hanged man? He was here!
They stole him!
He was here a moment ago.
He must've untied himself.
You'll have to find him.
I'm not leaving till you do.
-Commissar has lost something?
-Yes, a hanged man. And you'll find him.
I assure you I have not
untied any hanged people today.
-He's joking
-No, Commissar.
I never do any cleaning after 10 pm.
-Nobody believes me.
-I believe you, Commissar.
You found a hanged man.
-At least you believe me.
-Of course. But he disappeared.
-I know that too. But why?
-Because it was a phantom.
I don't believe in phantoms.
The man I hanged...
The ghost...I don't know what I'm saying.
The ghost I saw in the hall before
was Fantomas's man 
pretending to be a ghost.
Any ghost that turns up 
at this castle, I'll lock up.
A French policeman putting
handcuffs on a Scottish ghost?
Whatever you do with the local
phantoms will be right.
-You should of course explain...
-You're right; as soon as I remember.
The hanged man had a coat on
with a pink sign attached:
"Last warning before execution".
-A pink sign?
-Yes. On his chest.
Last warning before execution.
That must have been Richard.
You'll go right to the river.
Gentlemen, if I arranged for
a meeting here by the river
and at night, it was only to
ensure that we do not risk
being interrupted by the police.
Thank you for reacting so fast
to my call.
We must make an important decision.
When Giuseppe turns up,we'll work out 
the details of our next step.
He's just arrived.
How are you, Giuseppe.
We're waiting just for you.
Let's get to it.
Gentlemen, sit down.
We want to propose a sensational thing.
I'm sure you'll agree, Giuseppe.
Our good friend Andr Bertire,
the assistant of Lord McRashley,
told us about Fantomas's
new plan.
He has decided to levy a tax on
the lives of richest people on earth.
He's got some good ideas.
And there's no work involved.
-That kind of extortion is profitable.
-What do you think? A great idea!
And so we'we decided
to use it, too.
Our plan is simple.
We'll catch Fantomas, once 
he shows up at the Lord's castle.
Then we'll shoot him and hide his body,
so the police think
he's still alive.
We'll continue under his name
to collect the tax.
We've thought of everything.
Have you really? I don't think so.
To be clear
I am Fantomas.
Stay where you are.
Listen to me.
Since you know all the details 
of my plan, we'll save a lot of time.
Your contracts, gentlemen.
They're made out in your names.
-Such insolence! - -I'm a gangster;
I don't pay taxes!
I consider bandits and the higher 
circles of society one and the same.
All progressive societies
pay taxes.
Gentlemen; my compliments.
-Poor Giuseppe.
-He killed him.
Now it's Lord McRashley's turn.
Enough.
Commissar, this is a haunted castle,
but I'm afraid 
we'll still be obvious.
That's not the point.
-There are ghosts, here, understand?
-Real ones? --Fake ones.
The ghost I saw was also fake.
We'll try to provoke him.
When a fake ghost meets another
fake ghost, what will it do?
-It'll be scared.
-No. It'll consider it one of its own.
So it'll come closer and - -
I'll clamp the handcuffs on it.
Walk around the southern wing
of the castle, but don't get lost.
But no; that's not true.
I'm all for black humour,
but this is too much.
Quick! Alarm!
 They've killed Lord Rashley! 
Fantomas is in the castle! Alarm!
 Wake up!
They killed Lord Rashley.
-Coming!
-They have killed Lord Rashley!
-Alarm!
-What's happening?
-They've killed Lord Rashley.
-That's terrible!
-He's lying on my bed. Dead.
-On the bed?
Idiot!
 Happy to see you.
They've killed Lord Rashley.
 He's lying dead on my bed.
Nonsense.
 He's in his office, writing.
-Another accident, Commissar?
-My god, what happened?
-They killed Lord Rashley!
-He's in his office.
-How is it possible?
-I saw him lie there.
-What did I tell you?
-You're not in my bed?
I'm here.
Tidy up. Quick.
Why are you so surprised?
I found you husband dead
and next thing he comes here.
Everyone has a twin.
He came from the other word. A phantom.
-No; no phantoms!
-There may be another possibility.
Much simpler one.
I don't like people laughing at me.
Especially an Englishman. I understand now.
It's you! You're Fantomas!
You're wearing Lord Rashley's mask.
-Give me that mask!
-Commissar, what are you doing?
Let me go, Commissar.
You can see I wear no mask.
Juve, enough is enough.
Let's go, my dear.
You believe me, don't you? Lord 
Rashley is dead. In my bed.
Come take a look.
-If it makes him happy...
-We mustn't resist him.
He's still the same.
Looks just like the real one.
Soon you'll see the deceased.
Impossible! Someone stole him!
He was here, in my bed!
-Sure; just like the hanged man.
-Well, he was hanging. This one was lying.
-There were candles and flowers.
-Was it really McRashley?
-Yes! -- You've just seen him in the hall.
-True. -- You spoke to him.
I must be hallucinating then.
A nightmare.
If there's no corpse and I am
hallucinating, it must mean
that you're not here either. Not here,
not here; nobody here.
-My gun.
-Not here either.
Commissar, lie down.
You need to rest.
And when I've rested,
will all be back to normal?
-It'll all be clear.
-Well, I feel I'm asleep already.
-A sleeping pill.
-No.
You said I'm asleep,
but I want to wake up.
That's the thing. Understand.
When one wants to sleep,
one takes a sleeping pill.
When one is not dreaming.
And just wants to sleep.
So what do you take if one is dreaming,
but is not asleep?
-No idea.
-A sleeping pill.
Drink?
-Shall I lie down? Thank you.
-Sweet dreams.
Thank you, my friends.
I'll leave my camera with you.
You'll have to take a photo
of the next corpse.
That'll prove you were not
dreaming at the time.
-When I wake up?
-Yes. Good night, Commissar.
I think I'm waking up now.
Lord Rashley.
They hanged him! Help!
They hanged Lord Rashley. Here!
Lord Rashley is hanging in my room.
Alarm! The Lord's hanging in my room!
-What's happened?
-Nothing. Get lost.
Terrible! Lord Rashley
is hanging in my room!
-Who?
-Lord Rashley! They have hanged him!
-Hallucinating again!
-He's hanging in my room.
Here in Scotland, we 
consider only short jokes good.
-You must believe me; they've strangled you.
-Save me the silliness.
He looks exactly like him; his eyes !
are bulging out! Come take a look!
-More hallucinations.
-That's what I think.
-Poor Commissar has gone insane.
-Now I know why Fantomas 
hasn't been caught yet.
Soon you'll see for yourselves.
It's horrible.
-He disappeared again?
-But he was hanging just here.
I locked the room...
 Is this the right room?...
-You used your key to get in.
-Was it Lord Rashley?
-He wasn't lying here; he was hanging there.
-Did you take a photo? -- Sure.
10 seconds...
You'll see I'm right.
See him hanging there?
 As if he were at home...
What's that! Give it here!
Impossible...
A phantom.
 I'm going to lie down.
-What about the corpse?
-It was a ghost, too.
Sorry to have disturbed you.
I never believed in ghosts,
 and now I find them in Scotland.
-Bury his body at the bottom of
Loch Ness. - -Yes, sir.
Last warning before execution.
 A billion dollars!
I've been sent a reminder notice.
Despite the warning we delivered to you,
you still have not paid
the tax on your right to live.
So I am letting you know
that unless you pay within 3 days,
I'll have to increase the sum by 10%.
-The situation is serious.
-Thats' why I've called you.
-We won't take this sitting down!
-Only one thing to do.
-You'll help us organize a treaty
against Fantomasov. - -How?
You'll arrange contact with Lord
Rashley and his friends.
Will do.
Come in, gentlemen.
-Lord Rashley will see you immediately.
-Do you think we'll reach an agreement?
I talked with him this morning.
I hope he'll agree.
Good evening, gentlemen.
My secretary, Mr Bertire,
told me about your offer.
My friends and I accept.
We'll work together to destroy
Fantomas.
The more of us,
 the better chance of success.
I can't understand it. Bad forces
are all around me.
Yes, there will be obstacles.
That's him, the obstacle.
-Here! - -You don't think you'll
find the answer in cards, do you?
I will! The French Commissar is not normal.
He's cruel, too.
Twice he tried to convince me,
that my husband had died!
-That's horrible.
-There's more.
Andr, you'll have to look after
my poor Edward.
-Everything's ready. It'll be soon.
-When?
At the big fox hunt,
being organized at his residence.
I wish it was over.
The only way to break the resistance
against us
is to kidnap a few of them
during the fox hunt.
A hostage is better than a corpse.
-Looking forward to it, Commissar?
-Very much so.
-Glad to see you.
-Hello, my friend.
You are wonderful.
Welcome at the hunt.
William, you and your friends 
will ride to St Jacobs.
Mr Fandor, you're a great rider.
-Follow the dogs to the Haunted Valley
-As you wish.
Don't worry, Fantomas won't turn up
today. He knows I'm here.
-We'll have reinforcements from 
Scotland Yard. - -Still; be careful.
Should Fantomas turn up,
I'll handle him.
Where are you off to?
-Commissar, are you all right?
-Careful!
Stop hitting it! Where's my hat?
And my horse?
There it is" Come here!
Be quiet!
Don't run away. Wait.
Hawk calling Eagle, 
Lucipher 2 a Swallow 6.
-Ready for action?
-Yes.
-Group No 3, place Artaban
at section 7. - -Yes, sir!
Awaiting Artaban at section 7.
An order for Lucipher 2.
Cut William off immediately.
-Start action Artaban. Understood?
-All clear. Letting Artaban go.
Go Artaban!
The operation has been a success.
William has arrived,
we're taking him to prearranged place.
-Fine, pull Artaban back!
-Yes, sir; pull back Artaban.
No noise.
Quiet.
You must not scare it...
You see what you're doing!
Calling Lucipher,
Patrick's at the back at No 5.
Send Artaban and cut him off.
Artaban ready.
Sending him now to section 5.
Go!
If you hadn't forgotten your horse,
I could've gone back.
-I see a horse!
-Where? - -There!
-That's a bird.
-Underneath. - -To the side.
-I can't even see the bird now.
-Can you see the horse?
-Yes. - -And above?
-I see the bird. Let's go!
Don't frighten him.
It mustn't run away.
You moron!
-This requires an expert.
-Nobody around for miles.
-What's going on?
-A fox.
-Where?
-There!
-I've never seen a fox in my life.
-Me neither.
-We must catch it.
-We can't even catch a horse, let alone a fox.
A fox is smaller.
-We'll surround it and catch with the scissors.
-Pliers.
-What's this?
-Very suspicious.
It's a trap. Where's the horse?
I want a horse.
-There it is.
-Let's go there.
That moron has stuffed up Arbatan!
Operation Artaban in danger.
Wait for additional orders.
-Are you thinking of my husband?
-Yes, every time I think of you.
-Promise me it won't hurt him.
-You have my word.
-Try to take a good aim.
-Soon you'll be a widow.
Hawk's calling all men.
-Come to the rocky plain.
-We're riding!
Why are you following me?
-What gave you that idea?
-I'm in love with your wife.
I'm not jealous. I don't care.
You won't escape me now. 
You know my secret, so you'll die.
She saw me. On your horses.
Catch her and get rid of her.
Stop her, quick!
Fandor, help!
Fandor!
Fandor!
Help!
Fandor!
Help!
Fandor!
Fandor, help!
Fandor!
Fandor!
Let me go!
Pomoc!
Fandor!
-Let me go, you monster!
-No silly moves.
Take her to the arranged place.
Keep going. Higher.
Now down. Soon you'll be landing.
This way.
Straight.
-Nice horse
-It looks tame. Whose is it?
Let's see if its owner's around.
Anyone here?
-Yes.
-You shut up and bring the horse.
-Anyone here?
-No, no-one.
Bring the horse here.
-The chief hasn't called for a long time.
-Ask him if we should return.
Lift me up.
You must lift me.
Do it.
(FROM RADIO)
Chief, are we going home?
-When I tell you to.
-Am I saying anything? - -Quiet!
-What about me
-Find a horse.
Chief, answer! Can we return
home? It's getting dark.
I'll be...
The horse is talking!
-Are we going home or what?
-It's got to me again.
-Are we going home, Chief?
-Sure, we're going home.
What now?
My lady, I did not kill your Lord.
It's terrible, and we did not believe 
the Commissar. Can we save the others?
We can't call the police,
any alarm would warn Fantomas.
When Fantomas finds out I'm alive
and can identify him,
our situation will be dangerous.
Even tragic.
He'll kill us.
-Really?
-Yes; you'll see yourself.
-No, I haven't hurt you.
-Be reasonable; do what I tell you.
OEF 027, answer me.
OEF 027, answer me.
-Udlej pesn, co jsem ti kal.
-OEF 027 listening.
-How did action Loch Ness go?
-We've killed the girl and the journalist.
Wonderful, will call later.
-Quick, drink it.
-What is it?
-It'll put you to sleep.
-Sweet dreams.
-Better now?
-Who's here?
-Bertrand. Are you better?
-I have a headache. Careful.
Do you know a horse talked to me?
These are horse hairs.
-Where's the horse?
-Being interrogated.
Serves him right.
 Don't you think?
Of course.
-I'd like to know how they do it.
-What?
I'd better...
-Where are we?
-In the room next to Lord Rashley.
-No hanged man there? - -No. 
 I'm looking after you and the Lord.
Careful. Watch your head.
Gentlemen, Fantomas allowed us 
to pay later, but if we 
do not pay tomorrow, he'll kill us.
Tomorrow he'll let us know 
where and how to pay the debt.
-What do you think of it?
-Fantomas shows his power.
-To resist would mean death.
-Shall we pay?
-Yes, let's pay and we'll live.
-But...
-What are you looking for?
-I've left my gun here.
Go away.
This...terrible.
Commissar!
You won't give up?
Get out of here, you idiot!
-Commissar!
-What?
-Your bed!
-Go lie in your own!
You've gone mad!
Stop it!
-My head is spinning!
-Stop it!
-Anyone here? - -I am.
-Shut up! Anyone here?
Yes.
Welcome, Commissar!
I'm happy to see you.
Sorry to bother you, 
but I had to talk to you.
As you can see, you are again
at my mercy.
Luckily for you, you 
can perform a service for me.
-Never!
-What do you want?
-You'll work with me.
-Never!
What do you want me to do?
You'll be my accomplice
in an important financial transaction.
With pleasure. -- Stay out of it!
Smile!
Gentlemen, I am serious.
I'll tell you about your task.
So what?
-He's quite nice.
-You'll find all you need here.
-We'll have to synchronise our watches.
Do you know what to do? - -Yes.
What a great sleep Good medicine.
Too early to get up.
You'd just be in the way.
-Drink.
-I don't want any more.
-Just drink!
-I want coffee and bread rolls.
Tomorrow morning, if you're reasonable.
We've found these sleeping gentlemen.
We tried to wake them - in vain.
-Shut up; I want to sleep!
-We shook them repeatedly...
Enough!
-Commissar, what happened?
-Where am I? - -At the castle.
-Bertrand! - -Yes? Where am I?
-At the castle; where else?
-I remember. They gave us an injection!
-Not at all, Commissar.
-After the injection...I can't remember.
-Me neither.
-That sounds strange.
-Can I say something, sir?
When I shook the Commissar,
he said repeatedly:
"We are at Fantomas's."
-That was a hallucination.
-I assure you that...
I remember now!
We were at Fantomas's!
Shut up. Quiet!
Gentlemen, what is it about
the tax on the right to live?
It's true. You can go.
-Why did we keep it secret?
-He threatened to kill us.
-What is it?
-Stay out of it!
Fantomas asked me to collect from you
a million dollars in diamonds.
-I am to give the jewellery to you.
-And then?
That's my business!
Do you have any plan?
Nobody here. Come closer.
The room they gave us 
is next to yours.
Bertrand will put a button under 
your desk, connected to a wire
under the carpet.
The alarm system will be connected
to a red lamp,
which he will hang in your room.
He's doing it now.
You take a long time!
When Fantomas turns up,
you'll press the button,
the lamp will light up and we have him!
Where's my gun?
-I'll turn up then!
-We'll both turn up. - -Both of them.
Bravo, Commissar. I'd be surprised
if Fantomas got away.
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir.
Nobody must be allowed in or out.
Spread your men around the castle.
Will do, sir.
If anything starts happening, let me
know. I'll be available in an hour.
You go under the bridge,
I'll stay here.
-What's happening?
-Come have a look.
As you can see, I've carried out
Fantomas's orders. Your friends have
placed $800,000 in diamonds into 
this box. Just your share is missing.
Just a moment.
-It fell up your sleeve.
-Nonsense.
-You see, next time be more careful.
-It's in the pocket now.
At midnight Fantomas will
come to collect this box.
-Personally? - -Doesn't matter,
I'm here. - -We are here!
When he comes, press the button,
the lamp will light up and that's it!
-What's the time?
-6 minutes to midnight.
-Mine's 2 minutes faster.
-Mine's 3 minutes. - -Let's not waste time!
See you again soon,
Commissar. At least I hope so.
Good evening, Dorothy.
How has your day been?
Dorothy, what gave you that idea?
Good evening, Fantomas. I've been
waiting for this moment a long time.
Impossible, Fantomas is scared of 
a woman.
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what's happening.
-Don't move, or I'll shoot!
-Can't you see I'm Lord Rashley?
-Enough jokes!
-I'm not joking, Fantomas! Don't move!
Or I'll shoot you.
This time you've lost,
Fantomas. You have no hope.
You killed Lord Rashley,
to get hold of his wealth.
The police will be here soon.
We'll get you alive.
-Commissar, a signal!
-Hurry!
-Hands up!
-Bravo, gentlemen. Drop your weapon!
-Thank you, Commissar!
-Commissar?
You've stuffed it up again!
We had him!
You have saved Fantomas!
-I understand now! It was Fantomas!
-We've just told you that!
Alarm!
He'll get away in a rocket!
-What's happening? - -He'll get away!
In a rocket. --Leave me alone.
Call the air base!
Hand it over!
Call an alarm!
All airbases
Starting Operation Dragonfly!
You've stuffed it!
Hurray!
Fantomas is finished!
We'll never hear from him again!
