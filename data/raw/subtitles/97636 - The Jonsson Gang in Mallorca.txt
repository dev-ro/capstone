- I think that works.
- It will work! Just start building it.
- We'll start building.
- Start building. 10,000 peseta.
- Okay.
- Harry, put the sign up.
Yes, brilliant.
Every single Swede will come here.
I painted this.
That looks great. Come on, Harry.
- Okay, see you. {\i1}Hasta la vista!{\i}
{\i1}- Adiós.{\i}
{\i1}Olé!{\i}
Okay, Harry, let's hit the beach!
TOPLESS BAR
Real cactus liquor!
Harry's elixir of life.
30 kronor per bottle, or 1,000 pesetas.
Drink some with breakfast, and you're
guaranteed an unforgettable experience.
Or one you won't remember.
The cactus essence
gets the blood flowing.
- Harry!
- Hi!
What are you up to?
We're selling...
- Are you selling this perfume?
- {\i1}Perdón?{\i}
Ah, {\i1}perdón. {\i}It's Perdón perfume.
- It smells like cacti. Do you want some?
- Ew!
What kind of shit are you selling?
Let's go, Doris.
Haven't you settled the bill yet?
We're playing
double or nothing for the bill.
He's supposed
to guess where the olive is.
- Well done! {\i1}Muchas gracias.{\i}
{\i1}- Adiós!{\i}
{\i1}Adiós! Hasta!{\i}
How nice that we are all here together!
Yes, almost all of us.
- What do you mean?
- Sickan!
Oh yeah, him.
I wonder how he's doing in Sweden.
I'm sure he's happy, too.
As long as he's looking after
my apartment and watering my plants.
I'm sure he is. Right, Ragnar?
Alright.
Everything is planned and ready,
down to the last detail.
It is an absolutely perfect heist.
We'll hit the Globe Arena,
at precisely 00:35
on Wednesday morning.
"Brilliant, Sickan."
Charles-Ingvar, if you please!
I need a trapeze, four kittens,
a dried orange, and 16 suction cups.
I'll get it!
Well, if it isn't Director Wall-Enberg?
May I come in?
Yes, of course.
It was for me. Continue working, guys!
So, what's on the Director's mind?
It concerns... an assignment.
I see, what a shame.
How so?
My schedule is unfortunately
fully booked for the next six months.
At least.
I don't have a minute to spare.
- That's a shame.
- {\i1}Dommage{\i}.
It concerns a very high level
international mission overseas.
I see. One which you think
I am uniquely suited for?
Precisely.
How unfortunate!
Since I am here, maybe I could
offer you some refreshments?
Of course. Please, have a seat.
No hard feelings.
Oh, how nice. {\i1}Jolie! Bon!{\i}
Caviar?
Here you are.
- So, overseas, you say?
- Yes.
The thing is that I have some issues
with the border control.
I am rather well-known, after all.
- Georg Billgren.
- He's been dead for ten years.
How convenient.
For general expenses.
Cheers.
- Mallorca.
- Yes.
It's a shame that you are too busy,
Mr. Jönsson.
Well, it's just a matter of priorities
in my line of business, just as in yours.
Naturally.
Mallorca is Mallorca, after all!
Moorish,
but with some British influence.
So... What's the target?
A Franz Jäger safe in Palma.
{\an8}THE JÖNSSON GANG IN MALLORCA
- Billgren?
- Obviously.
This way.
The safe is
in the possession of a cardinal.
- Bulka!
- Billgren.
Cardinal Bulka attends
High Mass every evening at 10 PM.
That's when we'll strike.
That's 18.70 pesetas. How much is that?
- Sickan!
- Don't be silly, he's not here.
There! In the black car.
- Where?
- There!
The stethoscope,
talcum powder, and gloves.
Chamois leather from Finland.
Finnish chamois leather.
I'm not "finished" with it yet.
Hey, Sickan. How are you?
Hi, Sickan.
- Pardon?
- {\i1}Vamos a la playa{\i}. What's your plan?
- Do I know you, gentlemen?
- Gentlemen?
- Yes, do we know each other?
- It's me, Vanheden.
Yes, and I'm Harry. Dynamite Harry.
Oh, that rings a bell.
You're the cousins.
- How are you, Ragnar?
- I'm doing...
How nice. - And your girlfriend,
what was her name?
- Doris!
- Oh yes, that was her name.
- And you guys are still at it?
- Things are great.
- We're selling signs.
- Selling signs?
- Yeah, I paint them, and Ragnar...
- Oh, how interesting. Fascinating.
And that's going well?
That's nice to hear.
- But, hey, Sickan...
- Billgren!
- Billgren?
- Billgren. My name is Georg Billgren.
- He's working incognito.
- It's pronounced "in-cogn-ito."
Exactly. So, what do you
have in the works, Sickan?
- Pardon?
- When do we enter the picture?
- You two?
- Yes.
When do we strike?
You have a plan, right?
Knowing you, I'm guessing
you're not here on vacation.
You don't know me.
I think you have misunderstood things.
- We just want to help.
- Help?
The last time you tried to "help,"
the stock exchange expert
invested our money from the IKEA heist
in stocks which ended up
being worth precisely...
- Fifty-eight...
- Nothing!
I prefer to work alone. Good day.
Talcum powder.
Gloves.
Stethoscope.
Chamois leather.
Curare. Anesthetic.
Fast-acting.
Next.
Next.
Done!
Mattson, go outside and call the cops.
Is this the police? Cardinal Bulka.
Please come quickly. Yes, thank you.
Come on, boys! Hurry up and get my key!
- He might not have it with him.
- He might have left it in Stockholm.
No, of course he didn't forget it.
Run along now.
And send the genius my regards.
Two minutes.
Hey, Billgren. How are you?
It's nice and cool in here.
I wonder if they have
any good champagne here.
What do you want?
Doris wants her key back.
Her plants need to be watered, and you'll
be busy for at least the next two years.
Yes.
You should've stuck with your friends.
Yes.
You should have stayed at our level,
if you know what I mean.
Yes, I know. I'm useless without you.
Yeah.
- A loser.
- Yeah.
I fail at everything.
Yeah.
No, not everything. Right?
- You're not completely useless, Sickan.
- Yes, I am.
No, you aren't.
- You're pretty good at hatching plans.
- Yes. Very good.
- You think so?
- Yeah.
- You are also very good at that.
- Yes, we are.
What about Doris? Do you want us
to pass along a message to her?
- Doris?
- Yeah.
Would you like us to tell her
that she is a very nice person?
- Yes... Absolutely.
- Then we'll make sure to do that.
Time's up.
Goodbye.
- This isn't good, Harry.
- No.
- He may be worthless at times.
- Yeah.
- But he's still Sickan.
- Yeah.
Hey, I have an idea. Follow me!
- Hello!
- Hi.
- Jönsson is on Mallorca.
- Mallorca?
In custody!
Be careful now, Harry. Careful!
- Do you think this will work?
- Yes, of course.
Sickan likes bread, after all, right?
Come on.
Ask her for that photo,
the tabloids might want it.
Yeah, or the government.
Hurry up!
Must you use both hands?
Yes, for you, Mr. Jönsson, we must.
- {\i1}Gracias, {\i}colleagues.
- {\i1}De nada.{\i}
{\i1}Adiós.{\i}
- Here, we need a special transport.
- I understand.
Detective Green? That's me!
We'll grab a beer at the bar. Follow me.
{\i1}Gracias.{\i}
Cheers, Jönsson!
This is Doris' empire.
Reflexology and tanning salon.
- Things are going well for her.
- It's a goldmine. I painted the sign.
- And where do you stay?
- Here, just around the corner.
Over here! Doris doesn't want us
to use the customer entrance. Here!
I painted this wall. Here!
Here! {\i1}Entrada{\i}.
Come, this way.
I want to show you something
I have invented based on plants.
The cactus essence comes out here,
and, abracadabra, you've got
a glass of Harry's Sunstroke.
Try it.
It's strong, isn't it?
- It's strong.
- Very.
Shouldn't he be in the slammer?
Did he escape?
- No, not at all. The opposite.
- The opposite?
It was a misunderstanding.
- That's unfortunate.
- They confused him with someone else.
And now he's here, causing trouble.
We were having such a nice time, Harry.
Now you'll get wrapped up in maps
and flashlights and god-knows-what again.
- And who's watering the plants, Harry?
- Harry?
- Who's taking care of my apartment?
- We have some things to discuss, Doris.
- But the apart...
- We haven't seen each other in ages.
- Look, you have a client.
- And that's how it starts.
- Doris Karloff!
- Yeah.
Take a seat, Sickan. Go on.
I have been tricked, hoodwinked!
I've been treated like a grade A loser!
They have exploited
Charles-Ingvar Jönsson.
They bamboozled me.
It's not
the first time that's happened.
No, but it will be the last.
The police claim that nothing
was stolen during the break-in.
But I know that something was taken,
and I know who did it!
- Who?
- Two Swedes.
One of them is very tall,
the other is pretty short.
- The tall one, he is...
- Burly?
Yes. And the small one, he has...
He has a light colored hat.
They seem to be working together.
- Lizard and Brother?
- What?
Your brother?
Um... No. Lizard's brother.
I have seen them at the workshop
where I get my paintings framed.
- Lizard and Brother?
- Yes. The workshop is over...
- Harry!
- Yes?
- Could you help me with something?
- Let's go.
Harry, dear?
Harry, could you hang this...
I have never seen him before.
- {\i1}Gracias.{\i}
- {\i1}De nada.{\i}
No, it won't be a problem at all.
Thank you. Goodbye.
- What did the bureau say?
- What do you think they said?
I said there was going to be a week's
delay and blamed the Spaniards.
So we have a week to find him?
This time we'll nail
that one-armed bandit.
He can't really go anywhere,
we have his passport.
Okay, let's get started.
Knowing Jönsson, only five-star hotels
and the finest French cuisine will do.
The taxi is waiting for us.
Here it is.
The lights are on.
- Come on.
- Come on.
- There they are.
- Lizard and his brother.
Snitches.
What're they doing?
Come.
The flashlight!
Gertrud Germann antiques.
Vanheden,
you'll have to pick the lock.
I don't know
how to pick Spanish locks.
- Let's blow it up!
- Quiet!
I have a plan.
We have to get our hands on the key.
- That's Germann's antique shop.
- Let me handle this, Sickan.
- And the card?
- No problem, everything's under control.
- These are some great pieces.
- Thank you.
- You speak Swedish?
- Swedish, English, French.
My name is von Oben.
- A beauty expert?
- I have salons in Paris and Rome.
I am currently furnishing
a small salon in Palma
for the exclusive elite
who understand the importance of...
...the finer things.
And you think I would be
one of the exclusive elite?
Definitely, Madame.
At least in my opinion.
I would please me greatly to give you
the first treatment, free of charge.
- I don't know...
- I know, Madame.
2:00 PM sharp tomorrow. I don't think
either of us will be disappointed.
- That sounds very exciting.
{\i1}- À tout à l'heure{\i}, Madame.
We really have to hurry.
Come on!
- It's the same price as usual, right?
- Yes.
No, that wasn't it. - Here you go.
- Thank you, see you Thursday.
- See you then. Bye!
May I help you with the door?
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon.
What a babe, I almost started drooling.
Hi, Doris. How are you?
Great.
I'm going to take a coffee break now.
- But weren't you about to leave?
- Yeah, it's already 2:00 PM.
- So?
- Um... What about the show?
The swimwear fashion show.
Thank you, Harry,
I almost forgot about that.
That's what I suspected.
Hey, cut it out, Harry.
Why don't you take the car?
I will. Bye.
Pick me up in half an hour.
Position B here, over.
Position A here, over.
It's a yellow car with a sun on it.
Good-looking girl, can't place her.
Roger that.
Over and out.
- This is so quaint.
- {\i1}Oui{\i}, Palma is small.
Rome is big,
my salon there is as grand as a hall.
This is like a small bedroom,
if you know what I mean,
Mrs. Germann.
Mrs. Germann...
...allow me.
Harry, get the ultrasound massager.
It's terribly difficult to find
qualified staff in this dump,
but
you've got to start somewhere, right?
- Does that feel good, Mrs. Germann?
- No.
{\i1}Très bien{\i}.
That means we're getting somewhere.
We have to suffer before we can conquer,
like Napoleon said.
My bag.
- Your bag?
- Yes. My bag.
Where is it?
It's so hot, I need a handkerchief.
Here!
Oh, thank you!
Harry, open the windows.
Let's continue.
Mrs. Germann seems a bit tense.
Ah, {\i1}très bien.{\i}
{\i1}Très bien! {\i}There we go.
This is going well.
LA PALOMA RESTAURANT
There isn't much choice. Let's see...
That's enough.
The French sirloin is cheap. Come on.
Come on.
- I can do this.
- Shh! Just do it.
{\i1}- So, what do you think?{\i}
{\i1}- Good details.{\i}
Perfect photos.
This is doable.
- Two million.
- Two?
- For Bulka.
- And the remaining eight million?
You'll get that when Phase Two
of the mission is complete.
The bulk is still outstanding, right?
- But we had planned to...
- When Phase Two is complete!
That's it for tonight.
That way, gentlemen.
- What should we do now?
- Phase Two.
- The yellow car, it's here.
- The yellow car?
The yellow car
with the red sun. Let's go.
{\i1}Momento, señora, momento.{\i}
Over there...
- What?
- It was just there.
Sangria is a treacherous drink.
I remember how I was at your age.
- PM165370.
- What's that?
- The license plate.
- Great! Now we can catch him.
Oh! There's another party
in the Swedish community, guys.
- The nicer part, that is.
- Shh!
"On Sunday we will be honoring
one of Palma's most famous expats..."
...the Swedish antiques dealer,
Gertrud German..."
- Germann!
- What?
"...Germann, who is turning 60.
Mrs. Germann has,
amongst other things, trained as a...
...conservator
at the famous institute of... Pont..."
- That is perfect!
- What?
Sickan has bought a new beret.
It fits him perfectly.
- What a cheerful color. Coffee!
- No, not right now.
Yes, please!
Yes, please.
We have to bring
a present for Mrs. Germann.
Thank you. Hello, Darling!
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.
- Isn't it lovely?
- What is it?
- Cheers!
- Pace yourself, Harriet!
- You have to drink in this heat.
- I'm telling you to pace yourself.
- This is a real eyrie!
- But isn't it lovely?
- We're done here.
- What?
Morgan! You made it!
- Happy birthday, Gertrud.
- Thank you.
I have something for you, too,
that I think you'd be interested in.
Oh, how kind of you.
Do you still enjoy
living here in Palma?
Yes, it's enchanting.
But, Morgan,
this is actually Santa Ponsa.
I see.
- And your trip?
- It went perfectly.
So, what do you think?
Very nice.
Good photos.
They are pros.
My client
has guaranteed 50 million dollars...
...if the operation goes smoothly.
Which it will.
- Champagne?
- Yes, please. I'd love some.
Is this the way to the ladies' room?
No, that's out there.
Hi, Sickan!
Keep a lookout.
Shh!
- Where did he go?
- Sickan?
- Where did he go?
- He just disappeared!
Come.
{\i1}Paljon lunta mutta ei taskulamppua.{\i}
What does that mean?
"A lot of snow, but no flashlight,"
in Finnish.
You're crazy. Let's go.
- Where is Sickan?
- No clue.
- Maybe he turned into Billgren?
- And betrayed us? He'd never do that.
No, but Billgren might.
Yeah, that's exactly what that rat
would do. You know what he's like!
- He's a little shit!
- Yeah, damn tiny. A piss ant.
There's a pattern,
they're all like that.
Napoleon, Hitler, Lenin, Feldt.
They are all tiny like Sickan,
the bunch of them!
They are all despots! And he's
near-sighted too, and wears a beret.
- What a disgusting guy!
- That was the last time...
For what?
Sickan!
Ragnar, there he is!
Yeah, we were just saying that
that was the last time we abandon you.
- Yeah.
- We thought that you had left early.
- We missed the brains.
- The genius.
Losers, that's what you are!
Utterly worthless losers!
As soon as I turn my back to you,
you start piling it on.
Who do you think you are?
I could've died!
What in the world is going on?
Who is this?
Um... We almost ran this old lady over.
- That's why.
- You boys are crazy!
- Come with me.
- Bastards!
Come sit down.
There, there.
Is there anything I can do?
- Coffee.
- Yes, I'll get you some coffee.
- Coffee!
- That's a good idea.
Boys, how could you
almost run over an old woman?
How do you think that looks?
And it's all that genius's fault,
always dragging you into things!
Completely worthless...
- What happened, Sickan?
- It's time for coffee. Where is she?
- She took off.
- What a strange person!
- But she forgot her hat.
- She gave it to us.
The hat?
Yeah...
What a strange person!
- Don't you have a client?
- Oh, yeah!
Sickan, tell us what happened!
{\i1}Aquí, mira.{\i}
Okay, let's take a look.
There it is! It's
registered to "Dorisol."
"Dorisol"? Where is that? {\i1}Dónde está{\i}?
- We should have brought a map.
- We have one at the hotel!
Yeah, but that doesn't help us now.
La Map?
{\i1}Por favor.{\i}
Pour Favor? They sell maps at a place
called "Pour Favor." Let's go!
Your lipstick.
Germann has a custom-made safe,
which is connected
to an electronic trapdoor.
The trapdoor opens automatically
exactly ten seconds
after the lock is touched,
unless you've entered the correct code.
Then the trapdoor
automatically closes again.
- Clever.
- Franz Jäger.
The safe contains
the key to their entire operation,
as well as eight million
to be paid to The Lizard and his brother
when the operation is completed.
- We're going to steal the safe.
- Isn't it bolted in place?
Germann's home is meticulously guarded
due to her considerable antique assets.
The entire house is surrounded
by electrified barbed wire.
There are security cameras,
and heat-sensors in every window.
It would be impossible
for anyone to break in.
Except for us.
Below the trapdoor that I fell through,
there is a well that is five meters deep.
At the bottom of that,
there's a large hole, covered by a stone.
Remove that, and it leads to passageways
that stretch all the way to the sea.
That's how we're going to enter
and climb up.
"Calle" is written here,
in several places.
I told you
this wasn't the right place!
Hello!
- Look!
- Ragnar?
- Yes, what is it?
- Can't we measure this lying down?
We need to measure the height,
not the length, egghead!
What the hell? It's an old geezer!
Falling!
You are quite the stubborn vine.
No.
Peeping Tom pervert.
Oh, what do we have here?
Is it possibly a workout space?
What a mess!
Just like back home,
beautiful building, messy courtyards.
It doesn't bother us.
What's that hanging over there?
Hm?
- A bunch of grapes!
- Yes.
It's the house fruit. Try some!
It's delicious.
Well, we have seen
everything we needed to see.
Fine.
We'll see ourselves out.
They were here just a minute ago.
I have plan. I've thought it through,
down to the last detail.
We strike at dawn, at exactly 5 AM.
We will need a floatation device,
80 cm in diameter, a watch...
- And a two meter long rubber tube.
- Circumference?
41 cm. We'll also need
a beach ball and a watch.
You can't trick Harry
into going out onto the water.
Never! You can't make me
get onto that paddle boat!
- Stop messing around, Harry!
- No, I only travel in style!
- There it is!
- No, you can't fool Harry!
Hurry up!
Come on, hurry up! Come on!
No, you can't make me
go out onto the water. I'll never do it.
Come on!
The watches!
It's exactly 7:16 AM.
- Precisely, Sickan!
- You have seventeen minutes.
The water level has to drop
by exactly 180 cm. No more, no less.
- Understood?
- Yes, Sickan.
The pool is right over there.
- Wouldn't it be better if Harry did that?
- No!
- No cliffs and no seas!
- Harry is needed down here.
Here. Now hurry up!
- Flashlight.
- The flashlight?
Wait!
Floatation device. Beach ball.
Here's the floatation device,
and here's the beach ball.
- Here's the pool drain.
- Yes.
- There! That's the well.
- Okay. Let me take a look at it.
Oh, is that how it is?
So...
I'll put a charge here, so that we can
drain the water through here.
No, I don't think...
One second,
two seconds, three seconds...
And now we'll take...
Fire in the hole!
Sickan? You there?
Things are getting dangerous!
Sickan!
The rubber tube!
Damn cliff!
One hell of a bang!
Heads up!
We're ready now. Go ahead, Ragnar!
- Harry!
- I'm here!
Keep inflating it!
Let the air out
in exactly six minutes!
Roger!
It's all plugged up now.
Let's see... six minutes...
From... just now.
Harry!
- That will be at... what?
- Harry!
It's plugged tight, don't worry!
- Harry!
- Everything is under control!
Now, let's see...
- Stop!
- Keep floating!
- We're here.
- {\i1}I can see that.{\i}
{\i1}The gate and the front door{\i}
{\i1}open and close automatically.{\i}
{\i1}Two floors down, {\i}
{\i1}the first door on your left.{\i}
{\i1}I'll wait for you there.{\i}
There's still a lot of time left.
What was that? Oh, no!
It's nothing to worry about.
It's all fine. It's all...
Damn, it's stuck!
What a promising start.
It's going... well. No!
No!
No! Harry!
Look at that, it's leaking!
Harry! More water! More!
More water!
More!
What a blunder!
Am I alone? "Of course!"
Goddamn duck!
Perfect! It's halfway now.
Wall-Enberg and I
will be waiting on the terrace.
And you two
should be here around 10:30.
Well, that's just great.
Come on, you piece of shit!
Right. Just as I suspected.
Now it's precisely the right amount,
more or less.
Now this is an emergency.
The time is... Now... Now!
It's late! Time has passed.
It's already been six minutes,
like we planned.
Fifty-seven... Fifty-eight...
Fifty-nine... Sixty!
It's time!
Wow, that's so much water!
Harry!
Not yet!
Sickan! Where are you? Sickan?
Harry! It's too early!
And you, when would you want the copy?
- Now!
- It's in the safe...
Just give me a moment, gentlemen.
This way, gentlemen.
And you have checked the equipment?
{\i1}It's in perfect order.{\i}
{\i1}Yes, of course.{\i}
{\i1}It's designed by the best engineer.{\i}
{\i1}And the most expensive.{\i}
Quality is pricey.
- How peculiar.
- What?
The floor is wet.
It must've been the cat.
- But you don't have a cat, do you?
- No.
That's why it's so peculiar.
- What's the matter now?
- Did the cat pee on the safe?
It is unlocked.
- What is that?
- Billgren.
- Charles-Ingvar Jönsson.
- It's a goddamn disaster!
That... is to be liquidated
within two hours.
With pleasure.
- Where is Sickan?
- You, if anyone, should know!
- You were the one with the easy job!
- Yeah, I let the air out just in time.
It started flooding like crazy.
I thought that he had been flushed out.
Something has gone wrong.
We should scram!
- No, not the sea. Never the sea.
- Come on!
- But what about Sickan?
- I'm getting out of here.
Come on!
You got a beer?
He's a light son of a bitch.
That one is not likely
to piss on Germann's safe ever again.
Hardly!
- He isn't here!
- Maybe he's still up at the house.
Let's head over and check.
I have figured out Wall-Enberg's plans.
It might be the biggest operation
in criminal history.
A daring and unlikely attack
on the cathedral itself, in Palma.
- Are they trying to steal the cathedral?
- No.
But the cathedral's
most valuable item, by far.
- What is that?
- The Royal Cross, a relic.
It's gold and silver,
and covered in gems and diamonds.
Valued at 250 million.
It's prohibited to take photos of it.
The only photos that exist of it
are kept in Cardinal Bulka's safe.
- That's why they needed you!
- Precisely.
Germann has used the photos
to manufacture a replica of the cross.
- How do you know all of that?
- The replica is in Germann's safe.
They're going to replace the real one.
- How?
- I don't know.
- When do they strike?
- I don't know.
- Well, that sounds promising.
- Don't take that tone with him!
He doesn't want to hear that, not when
he's about to say, "I have a plan."
"I... have... a plan!"
- I don't have a plan. Yet.
- No!
Move! It's urgent! There!
- There are toilets by Plaza Gomila.
- Hurry!
No! It's up the hill and to the right.
Dammit! He got away, again!
This is pointless!
- What should we do now?
- Just keep searching for him.
The car!
{\i1}I have a plan.{\i}
It's them!
- Did they disappear?
- Yes, around the corner.
Relax. They'll be back.
- Hello!
- There they are.
- Arabs?
- No, it's them!
- But they're the same height.
- Yes.
This room contains
the world's finest art relic.
The priceless Royal Cross.
I have to ask all of you
to put your cameras away.
Photography is
strictly prohibited in here.
Any film will be immediately destroyed.
No more than two people may enter
the vault at once, for safety reasons.
So, if you want to enter, leave your
cameras here, and form a queue.
Go ahead.
{\i1}Adiós.{\i}
- They didn't do anything!
- They have changed their minds.
Let's come back tomorrow,
just as the cathedral opens.
I have a plan.
We need ten meters of sheet material,
black ropes, and a mannequin.
Harry!
Harry! Har...?
Where are they?
They're bound to be out
with their flashlights again.
They've taken the car, too.
If it's not one thing, it's another.
- They're here.
- Don't look!
- Do you have a camera?
- No.
- Go on in.
- Oh, {\i1}gracias{\i}.
Come here now.
Give me the cross!
Let's start walking towards the car.
Ah!
Brother! Where are you?
Just do exactly like we planned.
- Brilliant, Sickan!
- "Of course!"
Holy smoke!
What should we do?
The steering wheel!
Hurry!
Drive!
- Drive!
- I am driving!
Look!
Turn off!
- Here?
- No. There!
Sure.
Dammit!
Take care of the ropes,
and I'll handle the burner!
Harry has done this before.
That's it! Jump in!
{\i1}Mierda!{\i}
- Just get in!
- Come on, Sickan!
Yes! Come on!
Don't give up!
Don't worry, brother.
The wind is blowing this way.
I can't turn! It only goes up or down.
- I'm scared of heights!
- Harry!
- What about Sickan?
- I'll increase the flame.
We finally have some wind.
We're taking off!
- Higher!
- I'm firing as much as I can!
Hold on to Sickan!
I'm stuck. Help me!
We have to get rid of him.
Just shake him off!
- There!
- There you go!
That was a close call. Look!
- At what?
- Mallorca!
- It's so still.
- And quiet!
- How do you land one of these?
- You pull on this.
That opens a little flap up there,
releasing the hot air,
causing the balloon to sink.
- Well, how fitting.
- Of course!
You've found some bubbly, Sickan!
- Squat down!
- I'm the one calling the shots!
- One hell of a bang!
- Brilliant, Sickan!
Of course. Cheers!
- The flap!
- What flap?
- The flap!
- What?
Harry, we're sinking!
Don't worry.
We'll just fire her up some more.
Huh? What's going on?
He swiped the gas hose!
- That's not good.
- So do something!
- Like what?
- Do something!
- He's hanging on to the basket.
- No, no, no!
We're about to crash, Harry!
Should we land, guys?
Keep squatting down. Just do like this.
- Harry!
- Just relax your knees.
Follow what I'm doing,
and keep squatting.
We're landing!
We've landed. That went very well.
- Come on!
- What? Okay.
Wait! Wait for me!
No, not again!
- Brilliant, Sickan!
- "Of course."
{\i1}"La banda de Jönsson{\i}."
It is prohibited to smoke in here.
At last. What a coincidence!
Now we can finally wrap this up,
gentlemen.
Almost.
- Almost?
- Yes.
- There's just one last little detail.
- Oh, is there?
I'm curious to know
whether you'd be interested in solving
the biggest antiques' heist
ever attempted in the history of crime.
What are you talking about, Jönsson?
The heist that took place in
the Palma Cathedral, just a few hours ago.
We haven't heard anything about a heist.
No. And you're not likely to.
Not unless we can come
to a little agreement regarding...
...what should we call it... Immunity?
- Horse trading.
- Yes, that's one way of putting it.
Yes, I assume that you are
quite familiar with such practices.
- What's the deal?
- The following.
I can tell you, in precise detail,
how the heist worked, what was stolen,
and where the stolen item is now.
And who was behind it.
It wasn't us!
And what do you want from us?
Let us go.
What was stolen?
This.
The Royal Cross.
- They should be here by now.
- Relax. They'll be here.
They are pros, after all.
Look!
It failed!
Pros, huh?
Persson has returned
the Royal Cross to the cathedral.
I bet he'll be rewarded
with a finder's fee, too!
I guess that's it.
"A lot of trouble for no reward,"
said the woman who sheared the pig.
Well, we're free.
Yes, free but flat broke.
I guess it's back to the toil.
Why don't you go steal a horse carriage
and start carting tourists, Billgren?
Don't start squabbling again, boys.
Let's see what refreshments
Harry has to offer
to lighten the mood.
A little surprise.
- I don't want Sunstroke.
- No, I get that.
We usually drink champagne
when celebrating something.
- From the cave!
- What's that?
Eight... million!
- Pesetas?
- Dollars, Ragnar! Dollars!
- Harry! We're millionaires, Sickan!
- Doris!
{\i1}Olé!{\i}
Even split four ways, this is a lot of...
Did you get that much in damages?
- Damages?
- For the unlawful arrest.
- Yes.
- Of course. Damages.
Champagne!
Goodbye!
