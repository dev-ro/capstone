They have as much phlegm chest,
so they are completely dry pussy.
For the hell.
One of them I was the desk 53.
There are facts, ie.
It was totally psycho.
I would share the apartment
with a guy named Kim.
But Kim turned out to be a woman.
And it was okay for her.
We would each get our rooms,
and she had a son my age.
And then I thought: "She is over 50
and not particularly good either. "
But you know, mice in the house.
The mouse in the house.
It is proved that if a man
and a woman live together longer, -
- So they have to be together.
In our case it took two days.
Mice in-house theory. It does
No matter if she is 12 or 80.
And you know what the best was?
Her name was Larsen to last.
You know, Kim Larsen.

But the more I live here. The vacant space

that they get together at the end.
