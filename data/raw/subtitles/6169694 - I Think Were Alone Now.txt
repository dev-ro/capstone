Hello?
Is there anybody else?
Hey.
Is there anybody else?
There's nobody else.
Why are you still alive?
Why are you?
Why do you have a gun?
Just found it on the road,
thought it might come in handy.
For what?
Well, I mean, they could
reanimate all of a sudden.
That's not gonna happen.
Come on. I have to pee.
- Just give... Give me a minute.
- It's an emergency.
Hold on.
Okay, I'll unlock the door.
You just... You have to count
backwards from 100.
And then you can open the door.
Okay.
There's a car downstairs
waiting for you.
You have to...
You have to go...
to wherever you were...
on your way to.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
Yes!
- One hundred...
- No, don't start yet.
- Ninety-nine.
- Hold on.
I unlock the door and then you
start counting backwards from 100.
Step away from it, please.
Unlock the door!
One hundred, ninety-nine...
You sounded shorter.
Hey!
Wait!
Where's the smell?
- Where are all the bodies?
- I buried them.
All of them?
The keys.
I wanna stay.
So you're telling me you're just totally
fine with letting the human race go extinct?
Good luck.
Maybe I can help you
clear the rest of the bodies.
You'd get it all done
a lot quicker
if you had
an extra set of hands.
Maybe we could expand to the next town,
then we could go to the town after that.
There are no next towns.
So, why do you think
it all happened?
Everybody just dropping dead.
It doesn't matter.
It could've been the rapture.
Or some...
neurodegenerative disease
that only affects, like,
99.99 percent of the population.
Are you using chopsticks?
- Where were you when it happened?
- Sleeping.
You were sleeping?
On a Tuesday afternoon?
I worked nights.
Where?
- Right here.
- In the library?
Weren't you lonely?
Are you gonna keep asking me
questions all night?
That's what people do;
they ask each other questions.
You know what?
I'll tell you
when I felt lonely.
I felt lonely when it was me and
1,600 other people in this town.
I was pretty fucking lonely.
You have any more questions?
- I'll get my stuff.
- Okay.
Fuck!
Stupid fuck!
You scared me.
Where are you headed?
Niagara Falls.
I'm... seeing all the landmarks.
And after that?
Just Niagara Falls.
Why are you here?
I thought about it, and worried if I
changed my mind you'd be long gone.
Maybe we could have some sort of
trial period. I don't know.
We can't just...
Whoa...
What's your name?
I'm Del.
- I'm Grace.
- Okay.
Why are you here?
Uh, there wasn't, um... Well, it
didn't have an X on the curb, so...
Well, I haven't cleaned
this part of town yet.
Who is she?
Mrs. Young.
All right. Let's do it.
- Do what?
- Let's clean.
I clean the houses. I have
a very specific way of doing it.
Teach me.
Just this one house.
I don't know
what the fuck that is.
Batteries.
Single most important commodity
the dead have to offer.
The necrophiliac in me
would have to disagree with you.
You might wanna... put this on.
- What are you doing?
- I'm cleaning.
Why? It's not like anyone's
gonna come in here again.
Entropy is the idea
that there's chaos...
Yeah, it's a chaos thing,
I know.
With every piece of trash
we pick up,
there's one less case
for chaos in the universe.
Has anyone ever told you
you're kind of a weird guy?
Yeah. But they're all dead now.
What are you looking for?
You know who Tolstoy is?
- I fucking know who Tolstoy is.
- War and Peace.
Mrs. Young owed 700-dollars
worth of late fees.
Found it!
- You what?
- I found it.
She stretched the leather.
Wait.
- Aren't you gonna say something?
- Why?
She was a person.
Uh... Did you say something
for everybody that you saw?
- No.
- Exactly.
I held my breath.
I'm sorry. What?
Every time I saw one,
I would hold my breath
for ten seconds.
It's just something stupid
I did.
Okay.
We should make
chicken wings.
Too bad we can't!
Chicken wings with ranch.
God, I miss ranch.
I could put it in
a cheeseburger, pizza...
a sandwich.
It was so good.
These are expired.
Fuck it.
There's so many things
that are gone.
Pepperoni pizza dipped in ranch.
We can have
some strawberry pie filling.
It's still good.
What do you miss the most?
Quiet.
- What?
- Nothing.
Fuck.
- Clean up on aisle five!
- Can you pick that up, please?
Del!
Del!
Hello?
Fuck.
Come on!
- Welcome to the dog pound, Del.
- What are you doing?
Here.
Can you believe she survived?
Good girl, good girl.
Here. Come here, girl.
All right. I'm allergic.
Hey.
Hey!
Good girl, good girl.
Hey!
Aw!
- What should we name her?
- Bruce.
Hey.
Dewey?
Like the decimal system.
Nah...
I get it.
Balzac.
Ball-sack!
But she doesn't have
a ball sack.
Have some more wine.
- That's a real name, you know.
- No, it's not.
Dog!
Dog!
Hey! Hi!
Hi, good girl.
I had a goldfish once.
A goldfish!
It lived for two years.
That's a really long time for
a goldfish to live, you know.
Goldfish can actually live up to
about 25 years.
Twenty-five years? No.
- So? It's not really that long.
- That is not true!
That's not true.
Goldfish, they live,
like, a week.
They live, like, a day.
They die, like, the next day.
That's their thing.
That's their thing that they do.
If you don't take care of them,
they die.
Well, mine lived for two years,
which is a long time.
- Not really.
- Oh, my God.
Maybe you were a chef
in your past life.
Let's go.
- Grace.
- Dog!
Dog?
Shit!
No! Stop!
Shit, shit, shit. Oh, God.
What is that?
Sorry.
Why don't you stay and clean
this up, I'll take the dog out.
Give me the dog.
Give me, give me...
Ow!
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's fine.
Ugh...
Here.
Let me see.
Just hold still.
Thank you.
Del.
Del! The dog's gone.
- What?
- The dog is gone.
Dog?
Dog?
Wait...
I thought I tied her up.
I just don't understand.
- I... I let it out.
- What?
It had to pee.
She's a dog.
She's gotta pee, right?
Come on.
We'll find her.
Okay. What are you doing
with those?
You don't know any of them.
They're just objects to you.
My dad was a pastor.
People travelled for miles
just to see him talk.
And he died on the toilet.
My mom died on the elliptical.
Do you wanna know what I was
doing when it happened?
I was with a boy.
I think... I think you've had...
too much to drink.
You had no one.
I had everyone.
What are you doing?
Let me show you something.
There are a lot of houses in town that still
need clearing. I could... I could use the help.
Don't feel obligated.
Only if you want to.
Don't forget to water them.
So a vampire walks into a bar,
and he asks the bartender:
"Can I have a cup of hot water?"
And so, the bartender then
gives him a cup of hot water.
And then, the vampire pulls out
a used tampon and says:
"It's tea time!"
Isn't that gross?
Why didn't we just do this
before?
Del!
Del!
What?
It's Grace.
Del!
Yes?
Hey.
Now, we can always find
each other.
Del, I found a house.
What are you...
What are you doing here?
This house wasn't on the map.
I called you on the...
You're not supposed to be here.
Why?
Is this your house?
- We can clean it like the others.
- No, not this one.
You were never supposed
to be here.
It was just supposed to be me.
First thing I saw was the...
playground behind the school.
They were out for recess.
All right.
Let's clean.
Hold on.
I have to tell you something.
What is it?
It's about where I came from.
Whatever it is,
you can tell me.
Right.
Oh!
- Hello.
- Oh, hi!
- Um, Grace?
- Geez, uh...
- Hello.
- I'm Patrick, and this is my wife, Violet.
- Breakfast?
- Come on, we got pancakes, we got syrup.
Yeah,
let's set you a place. Come on.
Well...
Grace didn't tell us
that she had company.
You can just sit here.
Please.
All right.
What do they call you?
- What?
- What's your name?
Del.
Huh! Is that short for something,
like Delroy or something?
- No, just Del.
- Oh, okay.
- This is a lovely town, Del.
- Mm.
And your bodies?
- Sorry?
- Your bodies?
Oh, I buried them.
Oh, okay. That's nice.
Yeah. That must have been
a real operation.
How'd you manage that?
Well, Del, uh...
Tell me,
how'd you meet my daughter?
- Daughter...
- Excuse me.
Sit down.
He seems confused.
You didn't want to tell this fella
about your parents back home?
What, are you embarrassed?
Come on, Grace. Come on.
Tell him, Grace.
They're my parents.
Grace, why don't you go
pack your stuff?
We have a long ride ahead.
Your father has his club
tournament on Sunday.
Yeah. I play golf, Del.
Mm.
We got a heck of a league
back in Palm Springs.
You should see
some of these guys.
What guys?
What do you mean, "What guys?"
- What guys?
- I have to go to the bathroom.
Well, you're gonna hold it.
- What...? Others?
- He doesn't know.
You stayed here all the time?
You didn't go out to see
if there were other survivors?
Nothing? Oh, my God!
Stop!
Well, I mean, you can't
make that kind of stuff up.
I don't...
I don't get it, Grace.
What, did you... just let this
poor guy think that he was what?
The last man left on Earth?
- How many?
- Hundreds.
- Yeah, thousands. Right?
- Mm-hmm.
I mean, we got signs up
on every highway in the country.
Violet designed them.
- She's a graphic artist.
- Long time ago.
- I miss that.
- Yeah.
Let's not dwell on the past.
- Think about the future. Right?
- Mm.
Right?
Right.
That's what's important.
Okay, you all have to leave now.
I'm gonna keep chasing
this kid everywhere?
- Why don't you clean up, okay?
- Mm-hm.
Don't listen to them. Del!
They're not good people.
They're fucking crazy.
- Are those your parents?
- No.
No! You have to listen to me.
When I got to California...
Del, listen!
When I got to California, they paired
me with them. I didn't have a choice.
You said it was just us. That is
the first thing you said to me.
Well, I had to! 'Cause you wouldn't
have let me stay if I didn't do that.
I was on the road for months! I was alone!
And you were the first person I saw!
- It's my fault.
- Del, no!
Grace!
- No, no! Stop!
- Get your stuff packed up.
Ready to hit the road.
Let's go.
- Let go of the wheel, Grace.
- Take me with you!
Take your fucking hand
off the wheel!
Let go of the fucking wheel!
I feel so sad for you!
You told him?
I was worried.
It's time for you to
come back home.
It's time.
I don't think I can do this
alone.
Please come back.
Please. We'll make it right
this time.
We have to be a real family.
Come on. I'll pack for you.
Sit here.
This is... all yours?
And that's yours too.
Am I forgetting anything?
You got a sec?
Very busy.
Hey, I'm just gonna snag
an audiobook or two for the ride.
Oh, well, just give me Tuesdays
with Morrie for all I care.
I see...
I see... No, I get it.
Mm...
You ever get sad sometimes?
No.
I don't know,
I just feel like...
you of all people might understand
what I'm going through.
Look at you,
and your setup here.
I see a guy
who's got it figured out.
We all do what we have to.
Right.
Hey, that's exactly right.
Don't you wish everybody could
see things as simply as you do?
Here, everybody does.
Oh, I see.
'Cause it's just you.
'Cause it's just you, right?
I get it.
Yeah, that's good.
No, that's really good.
You know, we could really use a guy
like you back in the West Coast.
Yeah. I'll tell you.
Having a guy with your
capacities, it'd be a real get.
What if I were to tell you that
we've got a team of doctors,
the best on the planet,
coming up with new ways to harness
the complexities of the human mind?
I'd like you to leave.
I am talking some seriously
cutting-edge stuff here.
Well, all right.
Just in case you happen
to change your mind.
'Cause we all gotta join
the fold at some point.
It gets pretty darn cold
this far up north.
Must have been something
like those Wuthering Heights.
You know, the kind of a house that looks
like you can hunt quail in the hallways.
I didn't know it then,
but I was gonna be the quail.
Well, maybe this is
a beautiful...
My mind is all mixed up.
What seeks to destroy
civilization...
You know, there was something
about the way she looked at me...
The Conways, 41, Crescent.
Karl was a... lawyer.
Terry taught the 3rd-graders,
and Angela,
she loved graphic novels.
Karen Millikan.
Books would always
come back with...
little pieces of
sand in the creases.
Mm, it's Fred Cavanagh.
Mailman.
He was a nice guy.
What's going on?
Nothing.
I'll go check on her.
Uh, check that sensor
on her right temple. Okay?
Yeah, it keeps coming loose.
Hey, Grace.
Grace.
Did Del come back?
I'm sorry.
So sorry.
Oh, now, is that... Del?
Hey, man, good to see you.
Um...
Grace actually
should be resting.
What's wrong with you?
You put her back
in the fucking bed.
And then, you and me, we...
we're gonna have a good talk.
What...
What were you doing to her?
Okay, uh...
all of the negative feelings
that everybody has,
they just... wipe 'em off
the spectrum entirely.
Yeah.
All the... grief and sadness.
And, uh...
...anger, despair, guilt.
These people shouldn't have
to live with that shit, right?
It's not fair. Right?
So we're doing something
about it.
You keep your town
nice and clean.
It's great. And we do that
with our people.
They don't have to remember
what happened before.
They don't have to live
in the past.
There's no before.
There's only from now on.
Isn't that beautiful?
To not have to remember
anything?
I had a daughter.
I had a daughter once.
There's Windex under the sink.
Del?
I'm sorry I shot him.
Are you?
No.
Is that okay?
