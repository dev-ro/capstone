"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."
"The water's blue..."
"And the day's sunny."
"Come to the beach."
"Take a pic of me."
"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."
"Your love..."
"It's all I need, sweetheart."
"The water's blue..."
"And the day's sunny."
"Come to the beach."
"Take a pic of me."
"You'll be unlucky if
you didn't listen to me."
'Some people call me 'Lota'.
'Lo-ta'.
'Someone who's a turn-coat.'
'By the way,
the name's Lakshyaya.'
'If you emphasize,
it's Lakshya.'
'Well,
I like a lot of things.'
'Most of all, my father.'
'He died for his country
when I was just a year old.'
'I always
remember my mother...'
'...giving
tuitions to other kids.'
'She loves her country.'
'But I want
to get out of here.'
'To a foreign country.'
'To a life of money,
and fun.'
'They say life teaches
you everything.'
'But everything I learnt
in life, was from my friends.'
'From friendship.'
'God is kind.'
'But He takes long if
you ask him for something.'
'Over busy, you know.'
'So first take it,
and then apologize.'
'Let him take his time.'
'Me and my friend Debu,
would often buy beer...'
'...from the money we
stole from the temple.'
'But my friendship
with Debu came to a halt...'
'...when Debu went
to Australia for further studies...‘
'...and I landed up
in this college in Sikkim.'
'That day in college
started, just like every day.'
'But what happened next
changed everyone's lives.'
Lakshyﬂya!
What are you doing?
Something that never
happened before...
...is going to happen today.
You're going to take
a bath and go to college.
The first kiss of my life.
Boy or girl?
You fool, it's Jenny.
Oh!

"Sexy girl."

Please let me watch. - No way.
I am not that cheap.
Who are you to watch me kiss?

If you give me that,
then I might think about it.
Okay, done.
"Sexy girl."
Sandy. Training class can wait.
I've my practical today.
Jenny.
"Sexy girl."
Life's first kiss.
But do you love Jenny.
Idiot! - I don't know, buddy.
I don't know.
I don't know?
Kiss without falling in love.
This is lust.
What's it called in Hindi?
'Vaasna' (lust).
Craving!
It sounds so vulgar.
English is better.
It's lust.
It's lust.
Hormone complication.
Hormone...
Hello, ma'am.
Sorry. Hello, ma'am.
Thank you God... for
making hormones.
Otherwise... life would've
been so boring.
What?
Hey!
How dare you enter the
girl's hostel? - Sorry, ma'am.
Aunt! Aunt! Aunt! - Sorry? Go now.
Aunt! Aunt!
Give me blessings, aunt.
I am going on a mission.
Naughty, shameless.
I am not your aunt.
I am the girl's hostel warden.
Get that!
Debu.
Talk to him.
Ask him to come home soon.
Tell him.
Bro!
Hey, Debu. What's up?
Your brother's always perfect.
You say.
First tell me,
how's it going in Australia?
Class.
Listen, no need to come to India.
It's filled with heat, mosquitoes
and boring life, nothing else.
I see.
That's the advice you're
giving your childhood friend.
I will tell your mom.
I swear. - Aunt...
...please give your blessing.
It's an important mission.
Go, may you be successful
in your mission.
Thank you, aunt. Bye.
By the way,
what's your mission?
Kiss. - I see.
What?
"Sexy girl."
"Sexy girl."
Jenny.
"All I really want
is to hold you tight."
"All I need
is you by my side."
Promise me you're going
to tell me all the details.
Shut up!
"All I really want..."
"All I really...
Hail to the Almighty.
Have you finished kissing?
Oh no, I missed it!
What the...
Principal...
Good morning to you, sir.
Bad morning for me, sir.
Sir...
Sir... she's a family friend.
Her mother asked me to...
Actually... we're cousins, sir.
Sir, she had a toothache.
I was just checking.
Sir... I Will
definitely marry her.
Sorry, sir.
I cannot lie anymore.
Let me do it, sir.
It's my first kiss.
What's wrong
with the principal?
Somethings wrong.
I am sorry! I am sorry!
Please.
Whatever happened yesterday
was just an accident.
Please. Please. Please.
I am sorry.
Alright,
but don't you mess up this time.
Okay? - Yes.
Tomorrow evening,
Annual Function.
Backstage.
"Sexy girl."
Yes.
There's a battle raging
between India and Pakistan.
The Indian soldiers...
...are protecting their country
by sacrificing their lives.
Oh, Lord!
Boy,
didn't you go watch the play?
It's at 4 o'clock,
uncle. - No.
3 o'clock.
3 Pm - What?
You got me in a mess.
How will we get to college now?
Hi, guys.
- Neil, my brother, my friend.
Come on.
What the hell!
Where is he?
But, how will
you get to the stage?
I guess God made friends
when He was making hormones.
Jia. She will
open the door for us.
Thanks so much. - Thanks.
Chill, dude. - Bye.
BYE, bye.
Carefully.
I just want it once.
What are you doing?
Hey!
Relax, guys.
I'll do everyone.
One by one.
Wait.
Which one of your
dad has a Mercedes?
I have...
You first.
Go.
Go fast, go fast.
Hurry UP-
The sayings right.
Before you find
your Prince Charming...
...one has to kiss lot of frogs.
Oh, God!
Where were you, stupid?
She is waiting.
Thanks...
You?
Hi. - You out.
No, please.
I've a deal with him.
Get out. - Please.
"Sexy Girl."
Oh my God!
Oh my God!
Where's Jenny the Mother India?
I don't have time.
Jia.
Please... save my honour.
Be a mother for me. - Mother.
But who is the Pa?
I mean Mother India.
Mother!
Go, Ma. Go!
Your wounded sons
are waiting for you.
SOn!
Mother.
SOn!
Oh, God!
SOn!
Mother, you're here?
- Yes, son.
Mother, sing me a lullaby.
Son, I don't know a lullaby.
Sing anything, Mother.
"My name is Sheila."
"Sheila's bold youth."
"I'm too sexy for you."
"You can't
get your hands on me."
"My name is Sheila."
"Sheila's bold youth."
"I'm too sexy for you."
"You can't
get your hands on me."
"We crave like it's been ages."
Mom!
Someone save us!
Daddy.
Give us a hug, mother.
You're the enemy.
We don't want India.
We just want a hug.
Just take us in your arms.
No, never.
Mother! Mother! Mother!
Come under my refuge.
I will protect you. - Okay.
Soldiers, act dead...
...or the principal
will kill me.
Just go and die.
Help!
Please.
Mom!
I am sorry. Please, please...
Good for you.
Not concentrate
on your studies.
And these things are worthless.
My loom.
Don't worry.
There's another hormone for it.
'Sang-Dosh' hormone.
Because now you're
not going to find...
...your type of girlfriend
in this college.
I mean your fantasy girl.
36-24-36 types.
Stupid...
You know what your problem is.
You believe in
100 meters sprint.
I mean, relationships
are like a marathon.
Look who's talking.
Sprint-queen. - Guys.
I may have lost the battle,
but not the war.
If I don't woo a hot,
sexy girl in the next 30 days...
...then I'll polish
your shoes every day.,
Deal?
Deal.
Do you know, half of the college
students are being rusticated.
And after what happened today.
Lakshyaya, you're doomed.
- What?
What?
What?
The news is half of our college
students are being rusticated.
But why?
Forget why, think about
who's going to be rusticated.
Throw them out!
Throw the college girls out.
Throw the hot-dressers out!
They've turned our college
into so village-school.
The boys are always
looking at their legs.
They don't look
at the other options.
Boys college.
Muscular college.
It's our duty
that we do something.
But...
Get it out. - What?
But...
Your feelings.
Teachers.
I have decided.
Rusticating all of you...
...wou
d definitely
be the right decision.
But I have something
more challenging...
...for all of you.
As you all know,
our college...
...isn't just constructed on
the grounds of his royal highness.
In fact, many years
ago he started this college.
Few days,
the crown prince has signed a deal.
Play ground, auditorium
and girl's hostel portions...
...have been sold to an
Australian businessman Rockefeller.
And Mr. Rockefeller...
...wants to construct a hotel
and a casino on these grounds.
When I told Mr.
Rockefeller...
A casino and a hotel next
to a learning institution.
This is a bad idea.
It Will
be a bad influence.
Well he said.
Indian students are
only interested in studies.
They've no interest
in culture, sports.
They have no interest.
I said, Mr.
Fella, you're wrong.
So he threw a challenge.
If the students
of our college...
“manage to defeat
the Australian students...
...in sports
and cultural events.
Then he'll extend the
lease on that land for 100 years.
And I have
accepted that challenge.
You five have
to save this college.
There are just
four of us. - Yes.
Who's the fifth one?
You don't understand, Mr.
Pandey...
How romantic.
Learn something.
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
I guess your father
owns a jasmine oil factory.
That's why you've
applied so much of it.
Who me? - Yes, you.
No, no.
This is 'Am
a'
(lndian-gooseberry) oil.
I see. Good for you.
Have you met the fifth
member of your team or not?
Hi.
Saloni.
Her?
Which competition
is she going to win?
She will win all
the competitions. - Yes.
H ow?
When she applies that oil...
...the smell will make
the Australian team run away.
Hey, guys.
Any problem?
- No, ma'am.
No problem at all.
All fine, ma'am. - Okay.
Sir, these five cannot do anything.
Why don't we call
students from outside...
...and pretend that
they are our students...
Pardon me, sir.
But what made you
select these five, sir.
Neil. Local boy.
A big zero in his studies.
All he does is drive
his bike all day.
No one knows better than Neil...
...what a bike can do.
Sir. Jia.
She's the daughter of a ﬂop star.
Mrs. Dogra.
She's seen her mother fail.
She understands
the pain of failure.
Sir, Pardy.
It's the same story all over again.
Local boy.
The son of a musical
instrument repairer.
Pardy.
Interesting character.
He loves the drums.
And that will be an asset.
Saloni.
The daughter of a retired teacher.
Her memory's sharper
than a computer.
Lakshyaya.
The same story again.
His mother gives tuitions
to pay for his education.
And he's lazy, and most irresponsible.
He's my captain.
Baby!
Somebody save her please.
It's Okay don't cry...
So sunny.
Look there Lakshyaya.
Lakshya! Lakshya!
Lakshya! Lakshya!
Lakshya! Lakshya!
Come on, Lakshya!
Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya!
Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya! Lakshya!
My baby.
Tomorrow first period, library.
How did you climb up there?
Aunt.
First I stepped on that,
then that and then that...
...and climbed up. - I see.
Sir...
Lakshyaya has no
leadership qualities.
Take a look.
Mr. Pandey,
I think you're forgetting...
...who Lakshyayds dad was.
If we lose the girl's hostel...
...then what's the point of living?
Where there's life,
there are dreams.
Where there are dreams,
there are girls.
Where there are girls,
there's hope.
We'll find someone somewhere.
Everyone will find one.
"Party girl"
"Party all night"
"Party all night" - Guys,
just grow up!
It's not just about
the girl's hostel.
It's about our college,
our country, our self-respect.
At every event in life...
...people will definitely ask you
which college are you from?
This college is our identity.
Will we let those foreigners
seize this college?
No, we won't!
Three cheers for Lakshya!
Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!
We'll fight till the last drop
of our blood.
We'll fight till the
last drop of our blood.
But we will defeat
these foreigners!
We will defeat them!
We will defeat them!
Hip-hip hurray!
Hip-hip hurray!
ls this a blood-donation camp?
Where we'll donate blood.
And is it easy to defeat the
Australians in sports and culture?
Relax. Relax.
We're not going to fight
the competition.
But the speech?
I gave that speech because
girls like that stuff.
By doing this, no one can stop us
from entering the girl's hostel.
But, one thing?
You don't have a girlfriend
any more in the girl's hostel.
Then who will you go meet there?
I don't, but I will have one.
Let's plan for the competition now.
We will. What's the hurry?
Tonight there's a pyjama
party at the hostel.
Just you five are invited.
Because you're trying so
hard to save our hostel.
Here's the invite.
Don't forget it this time.
Leave me. - You always pounce
at the first opportunity.
Check the entire package first.
Why are you girls so judgmental?
Don't you girls talk about
boys in the same way?
There are other things in life to
talk about besides boys and girls.
Whatever it is,
keep it to yourself.
What was that you just said? - Sit.
Tell me...how many girls in
the girls hostel?
160 girls. Yeah!
160 girls for 3 boys.
What's the ratio? - 53.333!
She's right.
But I didn't get it.
53.33 girls.
Will I have to deal with all
of them in one night?
Pardy!
Okay, mom. I am leaving.
Wait...
Where are you going?
5 days a week you
spend at the hostel.
Only saturdays and Sundays are all
you get to spend at home.
Mother, I've to complete an
important college project.
Otherwise I would've
definitely stayed back.
Look after yourself.
What do you mean by
"Look after yourself".
Even the thieves know...
...this is Brigadier
Amar Singh's home.
Mother, if he had taken up
a corporate life instead...
...then you wouldn't be
giving tuitions now.
But no, he wanted to be a hero...
...so he sacrificed his
life for the country.
Someday you will realize...
...why does anyone give his
life for his country.
Mother, I am getting late. Bye.
Hold on.
My... - You will get your
papa's goggles...
...only when you're worthy of them.
Get it. - Mother.
You're getting late no, aren't you?
Go!
Hello, uncle. - Hello.
Uncle, I'm here to pick up Saloni.
Why?
For the night-long
veneration, uncle.
Veneration? In Sikkim?
Actually, a Pandit family just
shifted here from Beneras.
Listen.
Are there going to
be any boys? - Boys?
No, uncle just three boys.
One will play the clarinet.
"We will win."
The second will play the drums.
"We will win."
And the third will sing discourses.
"We will win one day."
Please, papa. Please.
Okay, okay.
But, listen.
Bring her back home
on time in the morning.
Sure, uncle. Thanks, uncle.

everyone's so beautiful."
"I wonder what these girls
are going to make me do."
"My astrologer says..."
"...girls are going
to get you killed."
"There is me."
"There is you."
"So let's start the pyjama party."
"Come on. Come on."
"Don't be so arrogant."

Jenny.
I want to kiss you.
Kiss me.
Cockroach!

Cockroach! Cockroach!
Save me! Cockroach!
Baby. - Someone please, help me.
Somebody help.
Cockroach! Cockroach!
Someone save me!
Cockroach!
Baby.
Baby, are you okay?
Mouse.
Cockroach! It's on my leg.
Someone get it off.
- Cockroach, baby! No mouse.
We can never befriends.
I never said so.
And anyway, to be friends...
...there should be more than
53.33 topics to talk about.
Like?
Like?
Do you know,
there's a new Intel chip...
...that's been launched
in the market.
With high configuration.
Multiple-core processor.
SSD drive.
DDR 3...Random Access Memory.
Display Card.
Folders, file management...
What happened?
Scared of her.
She's such a bore.
I've a cure.
Give her booze.
For friendship.
I don't drink.
This is cranberry juice.
In friendship you
should have trust.
Cranberry? - Yes.
Are you sure. - Yes.
You said...you're my friend.
Trust me. - Yes.
And I trusted you...
...and you gave me booze?
- Who did that?
You did, didn't you?
Don't lie.
You gave me booze, get that.
You're no Casanova.
This cute face.
What do you think?
These girls...
Them...
They're crazy about you?
They will die for you? - Yes.
But I am not like them.
I am different.
You...can never be like one of them.
Why?
Because...you're a gigabyte.
You're a terabyte.
"Do you know,
there's a new Intel chip..."
"...that's been launched
in the market."
Burden.
'Saloni was drunk, so was Jia.'
'I caught arrow by the teeth...'
'...so I had to face
the consequences.'
'How will we drop her home?'
'Her dad hates boys.'
'Well, we didn't
have any other option.'
'So we had to use apples.'
What's wrong with her?
Uncle, she got the fits.
That's how she is.
She's a very religious person.
Yes, uncle.
Come, dear.
Okay, uncle. Bye.
Take care. - Thank you.
Wait!
Why does your voice sound manly?
We sang the discourses.
So we got a sore throat. - Yeah!
Which discourses, dear?
"Glory to Goddess."
"All say... - Glory to Goddess."
What's this, dear?
The Goddess' boon.
Hail Goddess.
The Goddess' boon.
Hail Goddess.
Hail Goddess.
Hey!
What are we going to do...
...with the practice
money we'll get?
We'll party, what else?
Party's everything for you, right?
Everyone in Sikkim respects
your father so much.
He sacrificed his life at
Red Peak for his country.
But he didn't let the ﬂag fall.
And you... - So?
What did the country do for him?
Come on, Lakshya.
Why are you so bitter about
your father's sacrifice?
Anyone can...
- Stop this bookish language.
He was in the army.
Fighting and winning
the war was his duty.
Not mine.
Excuse me.
Our duty is what
we're getting paid for.
Listen you C++ gigabyte.
Have you lost your brains?
Listen, guys. Saloni isn't wrong.
We must practice.
Okay, guys. I am sorry.
For the next 7-8 days we're
going to practice rigorously...
...and everyone will think
we're serious about this.
Cool!
Okay. - Come on, let's practice.
Come on.
By the way, why don't
you join Anna sir?

The competition is in two parts.
Pan one will be...

By the way, when are the
Australians arriving?
The Australians aren't coming here.
You are all going to Australia.
Mr. Pandey.
I was always yours,
and forever will be.
I promise.
Even if Salman Khan asks me...
...l won't let him touch me.
Promise!
But why will he touch you?
Let's go, Mr. Pandey.
- Because I am so hot.
Yes.
Bye.
Hello.
The other day when you were drunk...
...you said you liked me.
Never.
I cannot say such a thing.
Why?
What's wrong with me?
You...are a 'Lota'.
'Lota.'
'Lota?'
All the best.
At last you found
the one you deserved.
You just wait and watch.
The entire college will watch
my next girlfriend with awe.
Really?
Loser.
Hey. - Hello, sir.
The biggest humiliation in life...
...is when someone
insults your country.
And the biggest happiness...
...when your country's ﬂag,
is fluttering proudly.
This is our country's ﬂag.
Don't let be insulted.
Mr. Rockefeller.
Indian team is coming.
We're waiting.
Welcome to Australia, bro.
Dude.

You didn't tell me, but mom did.

Hello. - Hi. Debu.
Do you drive a taxi here?
- Yes, part time.
By the way, I'm doing

'Jeanette .'
Saloni. - Shawn.
Neil. - Mike.
Ma. - Cooper.
Pardy. - Elizabeth.
Hi. I am Lakshya.

Hey. - HEY-
Don't eat too much, fatso.
I was wondering since long?
Aren't you Debu from B-21? - Yes.
You didn't send

Don't say that, I did.
You lier. ..
Give me some money.
Rascal. When are
you going to grow-up?
I don't like this English food.
L...l can smell stuffed-bread.
Nikki's coming along with

Remembering...
Here you go.
Eat all you want.
Stuffed bread.
How is it? - It's hot.

They already ate english food.
Let me eat.

For a nice...girl.
Someone who can make

'Nikki ma'am took care of
Pandey sir's hormonal imbalance.'
'On the other hand,
I was floored by Jeanette .'
'But we didn't expect that,
Rockefeller...'
'...would organize a party,
so that we...'
'...get to know the
Australian team better.'
'He said look around,
party and have a blast.'
'And there was Jeanette .'

"The water's blue..."
"And the day's sunny."
"Come to the beach."
"Take a pic of me."
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."
"The water's blue..."
"And the day's sunny."
"Come to the beach."
"Take a pic of me."
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."
You're such a rascal.
You know Hindi?
Mom's an Australian,
and dad's India.
"Your love..."
"It's all I need, sweetheart."
"Just you and me and
the sound of the waves."
"Come in my arms,
girl what are you waiting for."
"I'll take you on a huge yacht."
"We'll we drunk on Malibu shots."
"The water's blue..."
"And the day's sunny."
"Come to the beach."
"Take a pic of me."
"You'll be unlucky
if you didn't listen to me."
Friends always make
a fool out of you.
Friends give you booze
saying its cold drink.
Friends introduce you to aunties...
...calling them their girlfriend.
No matter how scoundrel they are...
...but we miss friends a lot.
Debu.
I miss you, buddy.
Aunt really misses you.
I miss you all too.
Specially, mom.
Lakshyaya,
did you take your passport?
Here's ginger powder.
Take it after dinner.
And here's your pocket
expense, for Australia.
What's this, mom?
Rs. 15,000?
I'm going to Australia,
not Pahadganj.
Son, that's all I have right now.
What's this, mom?
You never have money for me.
I don't care.
I want 50,000 right now.
You always get me humiliated.
Son, papa's pension
hasn't arrived yet...
When in need, there's neither
papa nor his pension.
I'll leave forever.
I'll settle down in Australia.
And never come back again.
You'll yearn to see my face.
I am leaving.
Lakshyaya. Wait, son.
Such anger.
Won't you even say bye.
I wonder why,
but every conversation...
...with mom turns into an argument.
I guess because there's
no referee between us...
...who can stop the fight.
Even I have had arguments.
Since I was a kid.
Yes.
But I already told mom.
I'll go to a foreign land.
Earn lots of money.
And I won't let you do this job.
Forget it.
The competition's tomorrow.
Let's concentrate on that.
Yes. - Cheers.
Yes.
Okay, okay, can I have
your attention please?
Alright people, so are you excited?
Yeah!
Okay-
So let's welcome
the Australian band.
We shouldn't have drunk so much?
You're right.
Hey! That's our song!
That day at the guest house...
...when we were doing practice.
I felt someone was overhearing us.
Oh no!
It's impossible to ready
another song so quickly.
What will we do now?
What do you mean?
This is clearly cheating.
Okay, relax.
I'll go and talk to them.
- No, Debu. You wait.
I'll go talk to them.
But Lakshyaya...
Sir, please.
They said these are the rules.
We shou
d've informed them earlier
...what song we're going to sing.
But while we were partying around...
...we forgot to inform them.
We made a mistake,
but what do we do now?
What mistake?
This is cheating, get that?
I'll talk to them. - Debu.
Sir, you're not getting it.
This is our song.
They have stolen our song.
Hey, you mean to
say we're cheaters?
Yeah exactly,
you guys are cheaters.
What the"
Debu!
Debu who did this?
Debu...
You son of b***h!
They insulted mother.
They don't know how mother...
...saved every penny to
send me here to study.
Will something happen to me?
You will be fine.
Mother has no one
else except for me.
Take me to my mother.
She's been waiting
for me for two years.
"Whenever I was hurt."
"Your eyes would brim with tears."
"A simple puff...wou
d
cure all my pain."
"Even today when I am hurt."
"I miss you...l miss you."
"Even today...when I cry."
"I miss you...l miss you."
"Mom."
"My mom."
"My mom."
"You were the answer..."
"...to all my questions."
"I would often eat your cooking..."
"...more than I was supposed to."
"I am a part of you,
I am your saga continued."
"Even today...when my feet burn."
"I miss you...l miss you."
"Even today...when I cry."
"I miss you...l miss you."
"Mom."
"My mom."
"I miss you."
"I would hold on to your veil..."
"...and sleep without a care."
"My heart's empty
without you, mom."
"No one could explain to me."
"When you're not with me,
the world's lonely."
"That's how much you love me."
"Even todaymwhen..."
"I miss you...l miss you."
"Even today...when I cry."
"I miss you...l miss you."
"My mom."
"My mom."
"My mom."
"My mom."
"My mom."
"My mom."
Wow! Excellent.
Hindi song?
ls it rock?
And the winning team is...
Australia.
Yes.
Debu, keep lying down.
- Let me get up.
Debu.
What is this?
Look, it's not like
I didn't hit them back.
I hit them too.
But...the problem was I slipped.
I was wearing high heel shoes.
Because I am a little short.
One shouldn't have a short height.
Debu...
Don't get sentimental and bore me.
Mr. Debu,
it's time for your medicine.
Oh, God!
The girl's so sweet.
'Debu was pretending to
be happy in front of us.'
'But according to the doctors...'
'...he was quite
critical internally.'
'And the Australian
police believed...'
'...that this wasn't
a racial attack.'
'But they will investigate.'
‘Investigate?
Yes.
We won!
Thank God you're here, bro.
First you go and check why they
aren't letting me go.
Mom's waiting.
And that doctor.
He's jealous of me.
That nurse is in love with me.
If you want...
we'll take her along as well.
Are you sure.
Will we go back?
You know...yesterday
I called mom and told her...
...l am coming back, with Lakshyaya.
She was happy.
She loves me a lot.
Don't worry.
I will take you along.
I don't want to stay here.
How did I harm them?
This...
Who does this?
Would we have beaten them
if they were in our country?
Take me to my mother. - Yes.
Once I place my head on her lap...
I'll be fine.
I'll be absolutely fine.
Take me back to mother...
Debu.
Debu.
Debu!
'Mom, when I grow up
I'll earn lots of money.'
'And you won't have
to work in school anymore.'
'Debu passed away.'
'Slowly my dreams
were fading away.'
'Next day
was the bike race.'
'Pandey sir decided that...'
'...no one should be informed
about Debu's death...'
'...until the bike race began.'
'Othenwise everyone
would've been disturbed.'
'Especially, Neilmwho was
supposed to drive the bike.'
'And Saloni,
who had to remember...'
'...the bike route map.'
'But before the race began,
someone told Saloni...
...that Debu's no more.'
Ready? - Okay-
Come on fast.
Come on hurry up.
Okay tell me,
which direction now?
Tell me Saloni, come on.
Saloni.
Do we turn or go straight?
Tell me quickly.
Saloni, are you listening?
Saloni.
Come on.
Come on.
Saloni.
Oh no...
We won!

Hey Lakshya!
Come on.
I think you're in love, Jeanette .

Didn't Debu come along?

"Makes you
dance to its tunes."

Losers.
- You made the college lose.
Shame on you.
Don't ever show your
face in the college again.
You people can never succeed in life.
I was your age, when I
first stepped in this college.
So many years.
This college is my life.
Unfortunately,
you lost in Australia.
The Australians will
be coming here soon.
The finals are still left.
Our country's honour
was tarnished out there.
But that shouldn't happen here.
Get it? - I know, sir.
But this college also belongs...
...to those who
were hooting at us.
They never did anything
for this college, or this country.
Their father wasn't
Brigadier Amar Singh.
'Who does this?'
'Would we have beaten them
if they were in our country?'
The night when your
father was shot...
...he had a choice.
He cou
d've left his post and
made it to the base-camp hospital.
But he didn't do that.
He kept fighting to protect the
honour of the ﬂag intact.
He lost his life...but
he didn't leave the flag.
When the body came home...
...there were 26 bullets
wounds on his body.
Decide, son.
Either this side or that.
Time will decide
right or wrong.
Okay, guys.
What will you all have?
Cappuccino. - Okay. - Brownie.
Black coffee.
Tulsi-Ginger tea.
Okay, I'll get it.
Hi.- Hi.
One cappuccino. - Yes.
One brownie. - Yes.
And one Tulsi-Ginger tea.
You will get your
order in five minutes.
Okay, thank you. - Okay.
Guys, I'll be right back.
Hey, mate. Thanks.
Your study admission
in the college and...
...your citizenship
has been confirmed.
You will have to help
us with the finals as well.
Okay, bro?
Thanks.
What are you doing? - Sorry.
Please. Sorry.
The fact is you can't do it.
The Australian team
is coming to India.
We've to dance for
the opening ceremony.
ls this how
you're going to dance?
You'll get us humiliated,
just like you did last time.
Bl**y hillbilly!
Saloni.
Hey, Saloni.
Look what I got for you?
Cranberry juice.
Drink this down,
and then see how you dance.
Remember, you said...
...there should
be something more...
...than girls and boys topic,
to be friends? - Yes.
So let's discuss dance.
Silly. No one discusses dance,
we practice it.
Why don't you wear a sari,
topped with a overcoat...
...and a blanket
and then try dancing?
Stupid, that's not how you dance.
Yeah, right.
Ready, ready, ready. - Bad joke.
1...2...3 and4
Lakshya...
We were practicing, mom.
Food is getting cold.
Come on.
You can practice later.
By the way,
you dance really well.
When did you see?
- I snuck a peak.
Mom, that's wrong.
No, I thought you two...
- Mom. It's not like that.
We're just friends. - I see.
By the way, I like this girl.
- Thank you, aunt.
Aunt?
Don't call me aunt?
Call me mom, mother, mummy.
Mom.
By the way,
I consider her my daughter.
Here you go.
I don't have change.
Mister. - Yes.
Two tickets for tomorrow
evening's show, balcony.
Okay-
Thank you.
What?
Oh, movie tickets.
- At this late hour.
It's for tomorrow's show, silly.
Two tickets
for the evening show.
Your change. - Thank you, sir.
I was thinking who
should I see it with?
I cannot come. - I never asked.
Lakshya. Hello.
I meant,
this would've been my answer...
...if you had asked.
By the way,
why would that be your answer?
Because the 'Lota'
only got a handle.
But he's still a 'Lota'.
I see.
"The effect of your
company was beyond words."
"l lost all consciousness."
"I was speechless."
"And I couldn't
express them."
"The heart
beats just for you."
"My eyes...send a message."
"It's the effect of your..."
So you will come today,
won't you?
Not at all.
Wow. Beautiful.
You're looking so good.
Hey!
How about we go around
town today evening?
No. I am busy.
Are you having an hormonal
dysfunction with Saloni?
No. It's not like that.
No, because these days
she's always staring at you.
Either she's planning
to beat you up.
Or she's started to like you.
Who likes whom?
Stop it. - You see, Jia.
He was saying that
he's starting to like you.
Yes.
No, no, no.
What's good about this scrawny?
He's got no life or stamina.
What the hell do you mean?
Shut up. - Stop it.
Shut up. - Stop.
Shut up.
"By borrowing a few
words from the poets."
"I want to say this
to you from my heart."
"There was a slight
intoxication..."
"...and now it's all over."
"My heart's not in control."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"A bit}.
"With the sweet fragrance
of your words lilting."
"With a smile on my face,
I see my dreams at nights."
"It's a new style."
"I learnt it...since I found you."
"I never focused on myself before."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"Whether you're here or not."
"But it feels like
it's only you..."
"...every moment."
"Every time we meet..."
"...l have an excuse each
time to see you more."
"My efforts to see you,
desires of love."
"Every time I see you."
"My breath makes a noise."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
"Love me a bit more."
I love you, Lakshya.
Do you know what I feel like?
I want to tell everyone...
...that, yes we love each other.
Tell me, Lakshya.
Do we tell everyone?
Tell me. - No.
Don't tell anyone anything yet?
Otherwise there will be a problem?
- What problem?
I missed you...
‘Lota-giri‘ struck again.
'Adam and Eve's
relation was perfect.'
'Because there was no
third person between them.'
'They would vent their hormonal
dysfunction on each other.'
But here, there was a third person.
And an occasion of 'Ho
i'.
I don't know why,
but hormonal dysfunctions...
mare always on
a rise during 'Ho
i'.
I'll be right back.
Stop.
Stop!
Come here.
"Do me a favour, let's play Ho
i."
"The colours are filled with love."
"Do me a favour, let's play Ho
i."
"Do me a favour, let's play Ho
i."
"The colours are filled with love."
Come on.
Mike. - Yes, bro.
I've done the rest
of your job. - Good.
But...l hope you
remember your promise?
Yeah.
Don't you worry. - Okay.
Tomorrow's the welcome
dance performance.
Take rest. - Wait.
You look changed. - No.
Do you want to separate from me?
Are you mad?
We'll talk tomorrow. - Wait.
You're in a hurry.
Maybe boys are always in a hurry.
But...l don't know.
Do you still love me?
Saloni. - Bye.
The first time I saw you,
I don't know why...
...l felt that you're the one.
I love you, Lakshya.
I love you.
'I love you, Lakshya.'
'Do you still love me?'
Lakshya, what happened?
Do you love someone else?
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
Why did you do it, Lakshya?
Why?
I cannot tell you
anything right now.
All I can say is
that I love you. - Lie.
I love you!
"My heart's so naive."
"it's restless and a fool."
"It loves you so much."
"But couldn't realize itself."
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."
"So it may get
completely drenched..."
"...in the downpour of love."
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."
"So it may get
completely drenched..."
"...in the downpour of love."
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
"Since I found you,
my life's changed."
"I've been completely renewed."
"if the world's really convincing."
"I want to hear only you."
"I make excuses to see you."
"I want to be the
reason of your smile."
"Spend your entire day with me."
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."
"So it may get
completely drenched..."
"...in the downpour of love."
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."
"So it may get
completely drenched..."
"...in the downpour of love."
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
Hi, Neil. - Hi.
Did you see the notice board?
No. Why?
Read it, and send your entry.
I will be specially
waiting for you.
Bye - Bye.
What notice was she talking about?
This notice.
It's clearly written here.
Sa
oni's Swayamvar.
Sa
oni's looking for a boyfriend.
And kiss him publicly.
Kiss?
If you want Sa
oni's kiss...
...then submit your
entries in the...
...box next to the notice board.
What?
Where are you going?
- To submit my entry.
Isn't this childish?
Please don't have double standards.
If boys have the right
to select and reject...
...and they can do
anything they want.
Then why do the girls
have to pretend to be pious...
...and worship them?
They have their right.
To find a suitable
boy for themselves.
Who gave her the
permission to kiss?
I did.
So boys realize that...
...girls are not
like tissue papers...
...which you can use and throw.
But who used you, ma'am?
That's the problem?
She became useless
before she could be used.
"It's pounding hard."
"My heart's scared."
"Sweetheart,
let go of my hand."
"Don't break the buds."
"Our hearts have united."
"So why feel shy from me."
Here are
the three lucky boys...
...whom Saloni has
selected personally.
Just like it was decided...
...Sa
oni will choose
one of them as her boyfriend.
And guess what,
she will kiss him right here.
Someone stop her.
I know what you're thinking.
You want to patch-up with her,
don't you?
Sure!
Get lost!
"
 wanted to
stay...away from love."
"From the
pain...that is causes."
"But...my
heart didn't agree."
I love you.
- "It brought me back to you."
"Friendship."
"Friendship."
"Someone please vouch
for my aching heart."
"So it may get
completely drenched..."
"...in the downpour of love."
"
 wanted to
stay...away from love."
"From the
pain...that is causes."
"But...my heart didn't agree."
"It brought me back to you."
"Where there's just love."
"Just love."
"Where there's just love."
"Just love."
Tell me something, Lakshyaya.
Did you like it
when Jeanette kissed you?
That was just a charade, Saloni.
I thought someone
from our team...
...has joined hands
with the Australians.
That's why I
went close to Jeanette .
So that she trusts
me and gives me his name.
What?
Did she say who he is? - Yes.
Remember, we've lost
part one of this competition.
Pan two.
The final
of this competition.
We've to
win it at any cost.
Tomorrow's the cycle race.
And the day after,
is the cross-country race.
Let me tell you the
cross-country route.
Participants will have
to run through this route...
...and climb on the tallest
mountain of Sikkim...
...and reach
Red Peak, where...
...the Australian and
Indian flags are posted.
You've to take
your country's ﬂag...
...climb down the mountain,
enter the college...
...through the college gate.
And plant your ﬂag at
the highest point of the college.
Whoever
plants the ﬂag first...
...the college will be his.
But many rock-climbers have
lost their lives on this route.
That's right.
Lakshya. - Sir.
Have you chosen your team?
- Yes, sir.
Sir, Neil will take
part in the cycle race.
And I'll take part
in the final race.
The next three
days will decide...
...whether our college stands,
or not.
Best of luck!
My dad gave his
life for this country.
But what did
this country give him?
Nothing.
Don't worry.
We've made arrangements for
you to settle down in Australia.
Just make us win.
That's for sure.
Neil's taking part
in the cycle race.
And he'll lose.
Because he thinks
you guys are with him.
He doesn't know...
...that I've
already made this deal.
Saloni knows
everything about him.
She'll publicize this.
Neil will be
blamed for the loss.
And I'll be in...Australia.
Neil.
What happened, Neil?
You rascal! I will kill you.
I will kill you. - What the...
You cheated on me.
You cheater.
You rascal!
Neil.
Neil. Neil. What are you doing?
I will kill you.
- Neil, what are you doing?
Weren't you ashamed?
You sold the
college's reputation.
You didn't even
think about Debu.
He gave his
life for the college.
Neil, I... - Stop it...
We would like to call
Neil and Mike for the cycle race.
I made a mistake too.
But just watch, I won't
let your plan be successful.
Just wait and watch,
I will win this race.
Neil.
Neil.
Let go. - Oh no.
Who will participate
in his place?
Best of luck.
Cheater.
"With the boiling
blood in our veins."
"By hook or by crook."
"We'll do
what we've decided."
"We'll go
home only after we win."
"So... heave-ho."
"Take a step and...heave-ho."
"So... heave-ho."
"Take a step and...heave-ho."
"There is power in our intentions."
"There is strength in the air."
My son has won.
My son has won.
I know that...
Whether anyone believed
in you or not...
...but I knew you would win.
My son...
My debu...
You are my deb...
My son...
Sorry.
We doubted you.
If we were with
the Australians...
...then you would've
never won this race.
Lakshya... - Leave it. Please.
I knew that you were...
...overhearing my
conversation with Jeanette .
That's why I made
this plan with Jeanette
...so that you get angry.
And you win this race,
instead of losing it...
...like you had originally
planned. - What?
But I didn't know
that he would get hurt.
And I will have to
take part in this race.
I am sorry.
Let's forget what happened.
We've to win
the finals as well.
Mike's going to take
part in the finals.
And he's injured.
So we'll win this race easily.
Do you even know who she is?
She's Debu's mom.
Do you know I had
a fight with your son?
Yes.
You are someone's son, as well.
I am really sorry.
ls there anything
I can do for you?
Yes.
Promise me,
if an innocent is being wronged...
...in any part of the world,
regardless of...
...what caste, race or
nationality he belongs to...
...you won't stay quiet.
Scores are equal.
- That's right.
Last race remaining.
But we Australians
hate to lose.
This is Sid. - Hi.
He will compete the
last race against Lakshya.
He will race.
Lakshyaya, wasn't Mike supposed
to compete with you in the finals?
Yes, where did this Sid come from?
This is wrong.
Do you know who Sid is?
He's the Australian
cross-country race champion.
He's not a college student.
He's a professional athlete.
My God, Lakshyaya.
You're going
to compete with him?
All the best, buddy.
I want you to win.
Those who are strong
don't always win.
In fact, those whose
victory benefits others, win.
Hitler lost, and Gandhiji won.
So don't be scared.
Fight and win.
Go for it!
Oh no...
'How did you get up there?'
'Aunt. First I climbed
up there, then there and there.'
'And climbed up.'
Go for it, Lakshya.
Where the hell is he?
Hey Lakshyaya 'Come on.'
'Come on.'
'Get up'
"Say...heave-ho."
"Take a step
ahead and...heave-ho."
"Say...heave-ho."
"Take a step
ahead and...heave-ho."
"There is power in our intentions."
"We are the feet of the breeze."
"Freedom has no border."
"Strength has no border."
"We can tear
mountains apart."
"Change the
course of storms."
"There is power in our intentions."
"We are the feet of the breeze."
The biggest
happiness in life...
...is when your country's
ﬂag is fluttering with pride.
You're grownup now, son.
Bye sir.
We'll always
be good friends.
Jeanette went back to
Australia with this promise.
Bye.
Mr. Pandey went back to Australia
with Nikki ma'am. - Bye Radhika.
Bye.
And Neil.
If he hadn't
betrayed his friends...
...then,
Debu would've been alive.
Sorry, brother.
I called him my friend once.
So there're no
apologies in friendship.
I made a mistake.
Jenny found a new
lollypop for herself.
Jia and Pardy.
They had to rely on
the compromise-hormone.
How many parts in the body?
0.03.
Will you make it in the future?
Are you crazy?
Here's 50 rupees.
Go get a shave, take a bath...
...and brush properly. - Why?
Because I am going
to kiss you, stupid.
We finally
saved the girls hostel.
But there
was no need for it.
Because now
I had a girlfriend.
Now I'm no longer confused...
...about why anyone sacrifices
his life for the country.
Yes,
but I am still confused...
...whether my hormonal
dysfunction is completely over...
...or will it attack again?
Pack up.
Roll camera. - Rolling.
Sound.
Action. - Action.
