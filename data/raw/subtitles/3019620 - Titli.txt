You said it was 270,000!

Dreams cost more than a penny.
Think it over.
Offer's open only till day after.
Decide quick.

Everyone's ready to party!
- Where were you'?

Birthday girl's waiting to see you!
Brand new dining table!
Shilpi's birthday gift.
Look! Uncle Titli's here.
My little baby Shilpi!
Happy Birthday.
See the fish'?
You're late.
Hello bro.
I had..
An extra class.
How's the board looking?
Bright enough?
Spellings wrong.
Where?
Of 'Emma'?
'General'.
Titli! Bawla!
Come out, guys!
Hurry up!
Help with the table.
Careful, don't scratch the edges.
I've brought cake too.
Pineapple.
Yes! 'Cause my cutie pie loves it!
Don't you, baby?
Whose birthday is it today'?
- Yours.
- Mine'?
Getting naughtier by the day.
- Just like you!
- Like me'?!
What's wrong?
Table won't fit through your door.
Get on with it.
I've taken bigger stuff in!
I'm off!
- Where to'?
- She has school tomorrow.
Let her be! it's her birthday.
Have dinner with us, sis-in-law.
Maybe next time.
You're not going anywhere.
Not till we cut the birthday cake.
End of story.
Stop pulling her!
You're being stubborn again.
Let us leave.
I'm telling you,
the door's too small.
Hang on.
Please don't ruin her birthday.
I beg you.
Sir, I'm in a hurry.
Wait a sec.
Give them a moment.
- Meeting time's over.
- No it's not.
Sir, please! I'm in a hurry.
What's your problem?
Door's too small.
Did you even try'?
Madam, it won't go in.
Why are you talking to her'?
Talk to me.
Can't you wait a minute'?
I have other deliveries to make.
- Finish this properly first.
- I'm trying to!
Really? Chairs are the wrong color!
- You'd ordered red.
- We asked for maroon.
Colour looks different out in
the sun. Madam, please tell him.
Talk to me, you faggot!
Not her.
You think I can't tell
red from maroon'?
Am I colour blind'?
- That's how you treat customers'?
- What did I say'?
He's piling onto me.
Am I blind, you motherfucker'?
You are calling yourself blind.
Madam, please tell him
not to abuse..
Stop talking to the lady.
You faggot!
Watch your tongue!
You'll tell me what to do!
Why can't I'?
Why are you hitting me'?
Bro! Sis-in-law is leaving.
Sangeeta, where are you going?
Son of a bitch!
Ruined my daughter's birthday!
Hang this.
Bawla.
Get me dinner.
Need to talk, bro.
Need fee money
for a course I want to do.
Now's not the time.
What course'?
Auto repair diploma.
Helps getting a mechanic's job.
How much'?
30,000.
Have you lost it'?
Service station business
has lots of money.
Why delay it, bro'?
Shut the fuck up!
Earn money of your own.
Then talk of delays!
Let's consider it, bro.
Him getting a job..
“Might help with the house.
Have you lost it too'?
Where's the money'?
Let's use the General Store money.
The shop alone
won't be enough anyway.
Not like we're opening a WalMart.
I mean, you decide.
Hurry up, you moron!
We're late.
Coming.
Out of the way!
Order's for a small car.
Keep an eye out.
All good'?
You sure'?
Hang tight.
We're coming.
Remember to ask Pintu for a receipt.
Understand'?
Don't forget.
I will.
Can I go now?
Can we finish work first?
Let's go.
They're not stopping.
Let's go!
Stop!
Stop, you fucker!
Shit! Shit! Shit!
Get out!
Shut your mouth!
Shut up!
Keep your heads down!
Stay down.
Let me drive.
Why'?
I'll get to practice a tad.
You deliver the car.
I'll get off at the bus depot.
I'll hand over
the course money to Pintu.
Now?
In the middle of the night?
I thought you wanted to drive?
He asked me to come now.
It's late.
Drop it off in the morning.
Let's go home.
I need to finish this.
Whatever.
Let's go together then.
That's the wrong turn.
Turn around!
There are cops this way.
I just need
to get to the bus depot.
What for'?
I thought we were going
to Pintu's house'?
I need to get somewhere!
- And where exactly is that'?
- I'll tell you later.
There might be cops ahead!
It'll be fine.
There they are!
We'll get caught. Turn around!
- I need to catch that bus.
- Let go, you moron!
Fuck! We're screwed!
Run now. Quick!
The door's jammed.
Get out the window!
You OK, guys'?
Anyone hurt'?
Why are you running'?
Catch him.
No hitting please! I'm bleeding.
- What's your name'?
- I'll tell you everything.
Not a penny more than 300!
I'll lock you up
if you haggle any more.
So what if it's
my daughter's wedding?
Gives you license to rob me!
Let me know if I can help.
Everything5 expensive.
500 for an invite!
You're overspending.
Let me help.
Caught my boys last night?
Which ones'?
These boys, sitting here.
They' re yours?
What kind of dumbfucks
work for you'?
Crashing a stolen car
in front of cops.
Bail me out, sir.
How much'?
50,000.
- It's for everybody.
- Wait.
It's for my boss too.
Business is in bad shape.
- Listen.
- Talk to him.
- Please, for old times' sake.
- Can't help this time.
Listen..
- Talk to him.
- Wait.
Keep this.
- How much'?
- It's 30,000.
OK'?
- How much for the cards'?
- 15,000, sir.
Pay him.
He'll settle your bill.
The boys'?
Mr. Sharma, let them go.
Take your things.
What happened'?
What happened'?
Money's gone.
What money'?
The course fee money.
Sir, there was money in this bag.
Not now.
We'll talk about it later.
- Get out of here.
- Coming.
Hurry UP-
I want my money back!
- Where is my money'?
- Get out.
Where is my money'?
Shut up and get out.
Titli!
Sir, there was money in my bag.
It was with you guys all night.
Flam Singh'?
What money'?
Take him away.
There was big money.
What big money'?
I had 300,000 in my bag!
What are you doing?
Flam Singh, throw him out.
You've taken my money!
What's he talking about'?
Get him out.
Go home.
I swear, I had money.
Give me my fucking money!
Sir, he's just a kid.
Just give me my money!
Please, sir..
Pick him up.
Where'd you get the 300,000'?
Come here.
Sit down.
Where were you going with it'?
Answer him.
I'm asking you!
Where were you going with it'?
Answer him!
What's the ruckus?
He was running away with 300,000.
Somewhere secret.
Deserves a mauling.
Answer him now!
Speak or I'll kill you.
Bro, not with that!
I'll hurt him bad!
It was to buy
a parking contract in Meerut.
To run away
from this hell hole!
You're calling the family
a hell hole'?
Is it just up to me
to run the house'?
Fucking liar!
You said you'll help us.
300,000 is not a small sum.
We could have fixed the house.
We could have spent
a couple of years in peace.
The boy's a snake!
Daddy, please go in.
I'll show you a real hell hole!
Wait. Calm down.
Bawla, you lay off this.
Get in!
- Don't defend him.
- Hear me out.
The dealer and the cop were right.
You're siding with those
two assholes now!
Blood-sucking leeches, all of you!
All of you are sucking
the life out of me!
Have some water.
Hear me out
and don't get mad.
We're lagging behind at work.
We need a girl on our team.
Women are selling everything.
“From blades to aeroplanes!
Let's do the same.
Let's get him married.
We get a girl on our team
and a leash on him.
You want a woman
to fend for us'?
So what'? Everyone's doing it.
That was the end of it.
No more jokes!
Have tea.
He's very serious.
Already got a mechanic's job.
We're not like that.
That's great.
He'll settle down.
Cars these days
break down a lot.
They're a perfect match.
Neelu's extremely resourceful.
And judicious too.
Extremely cautious with money,
food, clothes, everything.
Great with savings.
That should be a great help.
She can help Sangeeta.
We understand
the importance of women.
The world revolves around them.
Our mother passed away
when Titli was four.
We had to raise him
all by ourselves.
The sweet!
You haven't had any!
Yes, do have some.
Neelu.
Offer them some sweet.
Ask them if they want any.
Your tea's getting cold.
That's a yes from the boy then!
You have a deal, Mr. Singh.
Let's get this done quick.
You can choose the date.
But we want a big wedding.
There'll only be 15 of us.
What about the dowry'?
Congratulations!
How does it feel'?
The parking contract,
you bailed out..
Harmed my reputation!
Dinner's Chinese.
Have some for sure.
So what happened'?
I ran into trouble.
OK. Maybe next time.
Thanks for the photo.
You didn't ask for anything
except the dining table.
This is a fixed deposit
in Neelu's name.
It's for Neelu.
We're not touching it!
Your grandads photo.
On the dining table!
For luck.
We'll all eat together now.
Have a little more, dear.
I've finished.
What'? Have some more.
- I'm done.
- Have some.
I'm done. Really.
- You take it then.
- I'm done too.
- Go on.
- Not now.
- Eat.
- Extra energy helps the bedtime.
Any interest in cars, Neelu'?
Not really.
How about we buy one'?
For you two.
What do you say, Titli'?
Sure. Whatever the family says.
Great idea!
What about the Ford Figo, in maroon'?
Let's test-drive one
today then.
Take Neelu to the showroom.
Thanks, honey.
Try some sweet.
I'm done.
- At least try it.
- I've already eaten too much.
- Yes'?
- We want to buy a car.
- Which one'?
- A sedan.
Petrol or diesel?
Diesel. .
Red.
You know how to drive?
My neighboufs got one.
I have a scooter.
Where do you live'?
- Eastern suburbs.
- Which part'?
Middle of the new projects,
on the outskirts of the city.
Sixth lane.
Near the flood drain.
You live next to the drain!
Is there a problem?
Why do you want the address?
Planning to come over
for breakfast?
No, ma'am.
Why the questions?
Ma'am, these are company norms.
So you start grilling
every customer that walks in'?
Rules are rules.
We just want a test drive.
A test drive?
That's not possible.
We don't do test drives.
How does a customer decide then'?
- Have a look and decide.
- What about performance'?
That's guaranteed.
Ask any customer.
For such a big buy'?
Ma'am, I can...
You expect me
to spend my money
based on random small talk!
That's just plain stupid.
It's fine.
Let them take a spin.
OK, sir.
I'll need your details.
Let me do that.
The engine sets in slowly.
Opens up after a hundred miles.
Any free accessories?
The usual.
Seat covers, stereo.
What about discount'?
There's no discount.
Not even a little?
What are these buttons for'?
FM radio channels.
Easy, Mr. Chandrapal.
Try your stunts
once you've bought the car.
Who's Chandrapal'?
Seat belt.
Chandrapal. Your husband.
My husband'?
His name is Titli.
Grab the fucker!
Emma, step aside.
Let's go.
Take him with you.
Brother-in-law!
Drive, Titli.
Let's dump him somewhere quiet.
Dad!
Titli, I want to get out.
Calm down.
I want to go home.
Relax.
He's breathing.
Don't worry, he's alive!
Look, he's alive.
Let me go.
I want to go home!
We're going home.
I beg you, Titli.
Hello, Prince!
Leave the phone.
We'll be home in no time.
Relax.
Hold her down.
Titli, stop the car.
Stop the car. Hold her down.
Don't let go of her.
She's getting away!
$109-
Get in!
Let's go.
Calm down dear.
Cover her mouth.
Shut up or I'll slap you!
Who was she calling
back in the car'?
Some relative maybe.
Want me to check it up'?
Power the phone off.
Let's drop off the car first.
Have some food.
You wanna talk to her now?
After dinner.
Let's keep it quiet.
She's calm now.
Better strategy's to talk tomorrow.
Pass me the water.
Pintu, I'm here!
Neelu, stop!
Where are you going?
$109-
- Let's go back.
- No, I won't.
- Come on.
- Get off me.
Let's go back.
Let go or I'll tell everyone
you guys are thieves.
You think
people don't know already!
Let go of me.
It's for your own good.
I don't care.
You run
and the brothers come after you.
They'll go after your parents too!
Stay with us. You'll be safe.
I'm not scared.
Once my Prince finds out,
you guys have all had it!
No one's scared of your cousin.
You should be.
He's my lover!
And he let you marry someone else'?
He's not a goon.
He's a gentleman.
He's a top builder.
Well connected and rich.
The gentleman let you marry a goon'?
He's married.
Got blackmailed by his family.
He never wanted it!
Why'd you agree to marry me'?
I was forced to.
Hang on.
Listen.
Listen to me.
Builders are a dangerous lot.
His father will get you guys killed.
Shut up.
It's midnight. Where will you go'?
What will you do'?
Prince's divorce is coming through.
We'll hide till then.
Stay with me.
What'?
Stay with me..
...till the divorce comes through.
How come'?
I'll charge you a fee.
Will take care of you.
I help you guys get together.
Just introduce us.
We'll make a deal.
How much'?
300,000.
Why so much'?
You want to get to Prince.
I want to get out.
Sooner the better.
I've got 250,000
in my fixed deposit.
Dad's wedding gift.
I can sign that off to you.
How can I be sure'?
In my family,
we're good for our word!
In my world,
family doesn't count for much.
Your word is what counts.
Take it in advance,
the day you drop me at Prince's.
That wo rks'?
Let's go.
Who gave her the phone?
I did.
Who asked you to'?
Don't worry.
She won't create any trouble now.
How come'?
I've got the handle on her.
Did some bed talk.
The butter in the parathas
tastes yum!
- That's cream.
- Definitely butter.
Bro!
You coming'?
Hi there!
I'm heading out.
Button up.
I'm done in the kitchen.
Join us for breakfast.
No, I'm done.
We need to go to the market.
Have run out of groceries.
Didn't we get some yesterday'?
We're missing a few things.
We have to meet your mom too.
I'll take her.
See you later.
Prince's really excited to meet you.
He was curious
why you got named Titli.
It won't cause trouble?
Nope. His dad's out of town.
Mom's always at home.
No other siblings.
The wife is unable to conceive.
So she's busy mostly with
hospitals and treatment.
He'll be alone.
SQ?
What's with the name'?
Mum wanted a girl.
The name was for her.
Except I popped out.
She was disappointed.
Decided to stick with the name.
So you're Titli the butterfly.
Fluttering away to freedom!
Hey, nun.!
How are you'?
Hello.
- How's it going?
- Fine.
- Did you find it easily?
- Yes.
It's simple, it's straight.
Flakesh, call for tea.
No, I'll have lemon soda.
- Soda.
- Yes, sir.
- Anyone in the sample flat'?
- No, sir.
Let's show you the flat.
Then we'll chat.
Please come.
You can have the kitchen here.
The child's room,
bathroom and balcony.
Here, you have a storeroom, and..
- Gulshan!
- Yes, sir.
The child's feeling hot.
Get them a drink.
- Please come.
- OK, sir.
I'll take them to the office.
Let's get you lemon soda.
How've you been'?
- I feel totally rotten.
- Liar!
You didn't even
look at me downstairs.
The staff was there.
Can't let them know.
Did you miss me'?
Every second.
Close the door.
You do it.
Neelu, come here.
Keep the earrings.
You can use them.
Take them.
Give him the document.
What's this'?
Your divorce papers.
I printed them.
What does it say'?
That you've been separated
for a year.
And there's been
no sexual intimacy either.
Sangeetafs fed up
with your violent nature.
Hence, termination of relationship.
500,000 as alimony.
Within a month.
Plus monthy child care for Shilpi.
Or we could discuss
a share in the property.
That's possible too.
And if I don't sign these papers'?
That's fine with us.
We have videos
of her bruised and beaten.
Clear evidence against you
in the court of law.
Photos too.
Up to you
if you want to go to court..
Don't worry.
We'll arrange the money.
Where from'?
All we need are some big heists.
We'll figure something out.
Are you nuts?
She wants the money
within a month.
Neelu.
Yes
Sit. I need to talk to you.
You have to make me a promise.
Come what may,
you'll never leave your husband.
We're all one family!
I promise.
Swear on the Gods.
I swear.
Use Neelu's fixed deposit money.
That should fix the problem for now.
Are you mad'?
That's ridiculous!
We can't touch her savings!
The family is in trouble.
What good is the fixed deposit
if we don't use it now?
We'll give it back
whenever we have it next.
It won't take long.
Sitting and sulking over nothing.
It's not too cold.
No, thanks.
- Have a little.
- No, thanks.
Have some.
Please.
So what brings you here'?
I wanted to talk to you
about the divorce.
What about it'?
Please extend the one-month
alimony deadline.
We're caught up in your fight.
That's Suraj,
my friend.
We can talk in front of him.
Please extend it
Vikram is asking for Neelu's savings
to pay you off.
She'd saved for her education.
Her future will be ruined.
We've done nothing to you.
Everything was agreed
with the lawyer.
Within the deadline. That's it.
Your brother's got to pay up.
Sangeetas had enough
of that bastard Vikram.
Bastard daddy!
Shilpi, no!
Give me a minute.
Be quick, it's lunchtime.
Your wife's needs.
...are changing your perspective now!
You never cared that much for me.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Asking me for concessions!
What about Shilpi's school?
How would I pay'?
Where were you..
...when I needed your help?
Including that asshole father
of yours..
...who told a thousand lies
before marriage
Sorry but I can't help.
It's your problem.
It's Prince's birthday tomorrow.
You'll have to deliver a gift.
It's a surprise.
Deliver it yourself.
What'?
I'm not your delivery boy.
Give it
when you meet him next.
You said
you were close to Sangeeta.
Shut your trap.
Talk to me properly
if you know what's best.
Run my errands.
...or you can forget
about your fees.
What the fuck did you say, bitch'?!
What's that about the money again?
Let go. It hurts.
It's meant to, you fucking bitch!
You fuck with my money
and I'll make it worse!
You fucking bitch!
Which one's E15'?
Prince, Mr. Nora phoned.
You're seeing him tonight.
I'll go tomorrow, Mum.
You always say that.
Check up on the tiles too.
Did he just wake up'?
It's your Daddy's birthday.
Say happy birthday to Daddy!
Come in my arms.
Yes?
I have a..
...birthday gift for Mr. Prince.
Who from'?
Mr. Chawla must have sent it.
Come in. Have some cake.
Get him a piece.
Come. Have some cake.
I'll be back. I need
to make a call about the tiles.
- Titli.
- What?
- Come here.
- I don't want to.
- I'm going home.
- Please hear me out.
This is not what it looks like.
What is it like then'?
The baby was a mistake.
I swear. Listen to me.
Please don't tell Neelu.
If she finds out,
she'll destroy my family, my home.
- Listen.
- Give me my phone.
Should I create a scene'?
What will you do'?
Tell Neelu
Are you marrying her or not'?
I'm in a soup.
Let's be rational here.
Think about this.
You tell her,
she'll come after me.
I'll get screwed.
But so will you.
Right'?
'Cause if we break up,
you don't get your money either.
You can forget your deal.
Don't you see'?
You help me out.
I'll shut up. For good.
You have Neelu.
Why do you need me'?
I know about you.
You give me the money!
We'll get Neelu to do it.
- She won't do it.
- Leave that to me.
I convinced her to marry you
I'll figure out the money as well.
Till then, just lie low.
OK'?
You're lying!
You're screwing him. I know!
It's fucking obvious!
Where are you'?
You fucking cheat!
I'm coming over.
I'm coming over.
You hear me'?
- All good'?
- Yes.
What'?
What's wrong?
Sit.
What happened'?
Please sit down.
We can't let you sign
the deposit papers.
I have to break your hand.
Have you lost it'?
That's absurd!
You love Prince?
Want to be with him'?
What has that
got to do with anything?
We don't have time.
Vikram's going to ask
for the money soon.
What do we do then'?
I have a clear idea.
It won't hurt much.
There'll be a long-month plaster.
When it's off,
we'll be in the clear.
Let's get a fake plaster.
He's a bastard.
He'll check.
If he finds out, we're dead!
Think about it,
no money, no Prince!
Sign it.
What's that'?
Anaesthetic.
It'll help with the pain.
Your arm.
Don't be scared. it'll be fine.
Feel anything?
A little bit.
Now'?
A little.
Wait for a bit!
How about now?
No.
Are you crazy'?
You want Prince or not'?
Look away.
- Please don't do this.
- Look away.
Don't..
Done.
Remember. We met with an accident.
Fell off the scooter.
I've known you guys a long time.
You're not reliable.
We're ready to do anything.
We need the dough.
Sure.
Sir, Madam's saree
and your jacket are ready.
The finish isn't up to scratch.
Put it right.
Here!
Drop the clothes at home.
Show my wife the saree.
Come here.
There's a man, Keshav Gobriyal.
He's bringing in money tomorrow.
Ten million.
Stop the car. Grab the money.
I'll send you a gun.
Finish the heist.
Then shoot the guy in the head.
Make it a clean kill.
You get two million.
I take the rest.
Go on.
Sir, we're not really into murder.
So you expect two million
to water my plants!
If you won't do it,
get the fuck out of here.
Whafre you doing over there'?
I've been waiting for an hour.
I won't do it.
What'?
I did whatever you asked me to.
But I won't take part
in another heist.
Have you lost it'?
I don't want to be a part of murder.
I just want to be with Prince.
What' re you doing?
Stop! Listen to me.
Calm down.
Let's just talk about this.
Prince will figure out a way.
Hang on. Give me the phone.
Let go of my phone.
- Let me call him.
- You can't.
I must talk to him.
Give it back.
I must talk to Prince.
Let go.
Will you listen to me, dammit'?
You just sit in the car.
You don't have to do anything.
Calm down.
Let go of me, you bastard!
You'll ruin everything.
I'm this close to getting away.
I'm not a criminal, like you guys!
Shut up! Keep your voice down.
I'm not turning into a murderer!
Another word and I'll break your jaw!
Understand'?
Do whatever you want!
I won't be a part of this.
I swear.
With or without Prince.
$ol'l'Y-
Look, I'm on your side.
I'm stuck here too.
I don't know.
Then take me to Prince. Now.
That's not possible.
He'll be at home with his wife.
Let me call him.
He'll figure something out.
Let me call him.
If they hear a woman,
it'll be a mess.
I don't want to lose my money.
From the inspector.
The bullets'?
In the box.
- How many'?
- Four.
Which do you want'?
Rajnigandha.
- How much'?
- Ten.
Keep the shades.
No, I don't want them.
They suit you.
You're looking great today.
- Really?
- You look cute too.
Stay away from Bawla.
He's trouble.
Don't worry.
We've broken off.
For good.
I made the call.
Have to be at the tower tomorrow.
A flat has been arranged.
Don't call or text him
till tomorrow evening.
He's hosting a do at his place.
Why didn't you call in front of me'?
You weren't thinking straight.
We need to keep a cool head.
Just one more night to go.
Thank you.
Titli's a gem.
So like his mom.
He's the toughest of the three
brothers actually.
Never lets it show
if it's hurting.
Once he got bashed up..
...by a gang of kids
from the neighborhood.
They beat him to pulp.
Broke some bones.
He didn't tell anyone.
We found out
only when his wounds got septic.
When is that job'?
Today'?
I'll pray that it goes well.
Once it's done
we'll all go to the hill temple.
I last went there
with your mother-in-law.
I've never hit anybody since.
Neelu!
Go get ready.
What happened'?
- How much for a call'?
- Two rupees.
- What happened'?
- Need to do something.
Police station?
I have some info.
Two men will rob one million
on the road to Jaipur.
From a white sedan.
Car no. DL1215.
Catch them if you can.
What'?
We don't have a choice.
If we don't stop them,
they'll come after us.
Get on.
His car's not here.
He must be late.
Yes, he told me
on the phone yesterday.
He had a meeting.
Let's wait then.
Somewhere in the shade.
I need to catch the last bus.
Don't mull over your dad too much.
You're a good guy.
We got caught in a mess.
Ended up fighting a tad.
But I didn't take it personally.
Don't charge me
if I come to your parking lot!
Bye.
All the best.
Bye.
Departing for Mohan Nagar,
Ghaziabad, Meerut.
Cheer up, you sadistic fuck.
Your dream's finally coming true.
Good riddance
to your dumbfuck brothers.
They were an impediment
to your success.
Don't worry.
Give me the money.
I'll finish the formalities.
What happened'?
What's wrong?
You eat something fishy?
Mr. Khanduri, he's throwing up.
Give him some water.
$ol'l'Y-
Don't worry.
It's really hot. It happens.
I'll get some water.
Here, have some.
I don't want any.
Have some, please.
You'll feel much better.
I don't want the parking lot.
What did he say'?
Are you nuts?
Whafre you saying?
I don't want the parking lot.
Are you crazy'?
I've cancelled my holiday for this.
You don't want it'?
Pintu's been after me for months.
Who is this guy'?
I made a mistake.
Please return my money.
You make a mistake,
you pay for it.
This isn't a game.
Once taken, money isn't returned.
You should've told us.
We wouldn't have come.
You'll get screwed.
You wanted this.
Let's go.
Come on!
Give me my money back.
Shut up and run home, boy!
Mr. Khanduri'?
Let's go.
Motherfucker, I want my money.
Fuck off!
Where did you get that from'?
I want my money.
I want my money.
I want my money.
Why the fuck are you doing this'?
Give him the money.
We had a deal.
Give him the fucking money.
You fucking ripped me off,
motherfucker!
Pointed a gun at my face,
you asshole!
Just like your brothers.
The whole family's the same!
Criminals, all of you assholes!
You didn't go with them'?
Good you didn't, actually.
Both of them
have fucked you up enough.
About time
you break out of their clutches.
Have you eaten'?
Should I heat up some food for you'?
Let me scramble some eggs.
Will hardly take a minute.
Titli,
don't worry.
That bastard Vikram's reign is over.
You take over now.
Do what you like.
I'm with you.
Vikram made life hell for everyone.
That pig fucked everything up.
Had to beg..
You are the real pig!
What happened'?
Where have you been'?
We've been trying to phone you.
No one's picking up.
We've been worried!
Say something.
Is everything OK'?
Neelu's been crying, son.
You guys had a fight'?
She hasn't moved an inch all night.
Look, she hasn't moved
or eaten anything since yesterday.
Say something.
$ol'l'Y-
Sorry?
You knew everything.
They also knew.
About Prince, and my affair.
When we got married.
Both of you, please leave.
Your money.
It's all there.
I don't want it.
You can keep it.
You and me..
...we got off on the wrong foot.
Let's start afresh.
A proper family.
The right way.
There's no trusting you.
You could be lying again.
I won't.
I promise.
Let's stop by the doctor's.
The hand fracture
needs a permanent rod.
