There is no use talking to him.
No need to check again.
Let me see.
There is nothing to be surprised about it.
He is the son of the man who doesn't
even mind taking a coin from shit.
He resembles his father.
Careful! Don't abuse my father.
Why are you getting tensed?
Now dare to abuse my father again.
l wasn't talking to you at all.
Then what you said?
l was talking to vergheese.
But still it was about me
you were talking about.
Catch him.
Let them say anything.
Why are you getting tensed unnecessarily?
Mother, you didn't hear what he said.
May be he is drunk.
l should've chopped him into pieces.
Leave me.
How can he talk like that?
He never used to open his mouth
when your father was alive.
But now, look how he is talking.
After his father's death,
everyone has started to wag their tails.
He will say anything he likes.
He has the right on our land.
Everyone is on his side.
Landlords have none on their side.
Stop, don't go.
- What did he think of me?
Go inside.
l'm talking to you knowing
the current market rates.
It is Rs. 1 .20.
90 paise is your price, not mine.
There are totally 60 trees.
l can't tell you how much l will get.
May be.
May be few more than your count.
l'm not desperate to sell.
lf you accept my rate, come.
Orelse why waste time & money.
Listen, if you don't come
on the said date,
then there is no point in blaming me.
l'll find a another buyer.
Okay. Bye.
Don't take bath..
Just tally your accounts..
Let the pond cool down.
lt is still hot.
You never know to take bath
& keep yourself clean.
To take bath...?
Only now l came back from work.
That's what l'm trying to say.
Me too.
Who is that at this hour?
ls it Rishi?
So, you have come!
He is not going to take bath.
Have you got it?
- Yes.
lf we give it to him,
it is very tough to get it back.
Don't you know anyother guy
other than him?
Why to blame him?
How many times have you got it repaired?
8 or 9 times?
lt has been repaired very well.
Here on, it will run very smoothly.
lt will run for another 8 1/2 months.
Why 8 1/2?
Why not 9 months?
l've a doubt.
Will you tell the truth?
Tell me sister.
You take this to town to get it repaired
and bring it back.
Don't you charge for these?
- Charge means?
Won't you take money for it?
Hey...
He charges for all his expenses.
Rs.5 for taking it
& Rs. 6 for bringing it back.
Totally Rs. 1 1 for transportation.
What do you think of him?
He is very clever.
Just for Rs. 1 1? So sad!
You both gel very well.
How is your new venture?
ls it profitable?
lt's better we don't discuss about it.
Only if any bulb in a near by house get fused,
l'll get business.
The wires & cables which l bought
are still untouched.
lt's better they don't rust.
There is a solution for it.
l know what you do.
You sit on a chair
& ogle at the girls who pass by.
There is a little truth
in what you said.
l can atleast have a good view
of the girls.
That's why l stay there.
There is nothing in this village.
l'm only an ordinary guy.
You can lead a luxurious life since
you're the son of Thambooran.
But can l lead such a life?
l'm getting few proposals for marriage.
lf they ask about my job, l will tell
them that l've business in town.
When l live in town, l can look
after the business & ogle at girls.
You can only ogle at girls & nothing more.
From your face
I can read that.
Yes, it is true.
You have to see what boys
do in town
They are only kids.
Why talk about town?
Do you know what all is happening here?
You should listen to the
experiences of little boys.
Those are real life experiences.
We'll be shocked to hear that.
We must also break that.
Go ahead. Who is stopping you?
Tresya Joseph lives close to your house.
Not possible..
-Why not possible?
She is now the dream girl of this village.
She is the cuckoo of this village.
Really?
All the boys of the village are after her.
She goes to town very frequently
in different A/C cars.
l've heard some rumours about her.
Since she is your neighbour,
Why not try once?
There is nothing to lose.
No.
l can't spoil may image in the village.
lf we lose our status
& image here, where else can we go?
lf we are not careful,
our image will get spoiled.
You will die due to constipation.

The prices are very cheap.
But still,
Will you spend this much bus fair

No need for any bike.

Enjoyment is inside...
You told me about your desire,

You get in.
Do you recognize her?
Tresia Jose.
She is from our village.
Are you going to say you don't know me?
l know you.
You both don't have any problem,

You are leaving, right?

l knew it.
lf l stay here, this play will continue.
Don't stay here.
Will you be here?
- Yes. You can leave.
He is my friend.
- l'll take care of him.
Bye.
lt's only a child's play to him.
When compared to his other activities,
these are nothing.
Did he leave last night itself?
ln your town, people hate him
for being so stingy.
Which of the two is true?
To him, everything means fun.
You can stay here till 12 O'clock.
No, l'll move now.
What you told me about him is true, ah?
Yes, whatever l told you about him is true.
Why should l lie to you about him?
You said he never slept
with any girl till now.
As far as l know, he never did.
He does such things for his friends.
l understood.
Does he have lot of friends in this town?
l didn't know.
He lived here for more than 4 yrs.
He used to be a hero
when he was in college.
He had spent most of his father's earnings.
He never needs any money
to do anything in this town.
How is that possible?
Yes, it is possible.
Everyone knows about him.
He personally comes
& pays the dues within a week.
That his secret.
And he'll leave without anyone's knowledge.
He is more trustworthy than a bank.
So, hotels, bars, taxis
offer their free service to him.
lf l tell this to the villagers,
they will beat me.
Why do you want to tell them unnecessarily?
l told you all this because he told me
to tell you if you ask about him.
We should have brought aunty with us.
All the 9 houses are in different continents.
My mother knows.
That's why she sent us.
She sent us to wander around the village.
Somebody is coming this way.
Here? Who are they?
Stop staring at them. Do your work.
Where is Mannarthodi's house?
Mannarthodi...?
What's the matter?
Where are you coming from?
From town.- l knew it.
Why do you want to goto his house?
l'm from Mannarthodi. Tell me.
Jaikrishna Menon...
- Yes.
You must have heard about me.

So, you meet him once in a year.
Yes, he came and went recently.
Very difficult, right?
We came to invitite.
- For what?
For a ''Sapthathi''?
Sapthathi means 70th birthday, right?
You don't look like 70 yr. old women?
Not us.

- Whose great grandmother?
Ours. She is Radha, my cousin.
My father's sister's daughter.
l live with her in town.

One of them will come.
Who? How do you know them?
Do you know Malini's husband
late Kunjikrishnan?- Yes.
Kunjikrishnan's sister's husband
is K.R. Marathu.
Yes Marathu.
Radha's father married K.R.'s sister.
That means my mother's brother,
Baskar uncle.
So she is from Thiruvarpathu...?
Yes, you're right.
- Only now l understood.
You've a brother named Madhavan
who is a journalist. - Yes.
So, you have also come here before.
Yes. But long back.
Wow! You've grown up very fast.
When you came here before,
you were very bony.
While coming this way,
you sit on Madhavan cycle's hand bar
and you used to look like
a little lizard.
Are you not coming with us
to your house?- l'll try.
Go straight & you'll end up
in our garden.
From there, you can see our house.
Go straight.
What did you say your name is?
Radha.- Yes, Radha.
When you meet anyone,
try to give some respect.
What is this?
- He is very uncultured.
l told her that l like her.
You could've told me when she was here.
What would've happened?
l would've enquired about
that girl with Ranjini.
Why beat around the bush?
l myself would've told her.
Will she pounce on me if l tell her?
How can we talk about this to girls
of this generation?
lf we take this proposal to them,
they'll surely accept it.
lt isn't because you're smart.
lt's because you are the
son of Justice Thambooran.
Or else no intelligent
& modern girl will ever marry you.
l'll throw this on you.
Now the bell will ring.
Everyone will go to their classes.
We'll have to wait here
for another 1 1/2 hr.
l'll make her come out the class.
What do you think of me?
This is our college.
We had spent 4 yrs. studying here.
Do you know l made this college principal
drink his first peg of liquor?
Actually, he was my professor.
Go. But beware of boys.
What boys!
l came in search of you.
Please come.
Come l say.
l would like to marry you.
Do you have any objection?
lf you've any problem, just tell me now.
l feel disturbed. That's why l came here.
Since when are you disturbed?
- From the moment l saw you.
lt's better you change yourself.
l'm very serious.
You don't have to reply right away.
l couldn't stop myself saying this to you.
That's why l came here.
Why did you come to college
early morning?
l'm not here to create any problem.
You don't have to reply to me.
Malini sister or Ranjini will talk to you.
Tell your decision to them.
Till then, let this disturbance continue.
l like it.
l've nothing to say
to Malini sister or Ranjini.
l tell you my decision right now.
l don't like you.
l've heard a lot about you.
After seeing you, l realized that
you're more than what l heard about you.
You want to be disturbed, right?
But please relieve me out of it.
Who is he? What is he to you? Shall we deal with him?
Radha had ''Moolakuru'' problem in the morning.
l mean Piles.
Her mother sent me to know how she is.
When l spoke to her,
it busted.
She is hot because of that.
Don't worry my dear.
lt will pain for a while.
You don't have to worry about that.
Now, go to your class.
Met her?
- l couldn't meet her.
l told you, didn't l?
What should we do now?
Lets go.- Then...?
We'll have lime juice.
Lime juice? Now?
Did it happen like that?
lf she tells this to her family,
everyone will know this.
l don't care about that.
lt's not that.
Only now l realise how foolish l was.
Why did I control myself till this age ?
Why should l?
She said she doesn't like me.
l like her & everyone woman in this city.
Now you'll see who l am.
Drink & leave quickly.
There will be problem
if you stay.
You've a bus now.
Or else l'll take you in my scooter.
Don't stay in this town
with your disturbed mind.
No need.
Thangal,
Please sit.
How did you know that l was here?
To be frank,
l would've phoned your home in 2 days.
I wanted to see you.
-What?
Nothing.
lt is to discuss some personal matter.
Okay, l'll move. You continue.
l've some work in my shop.
Better don't create new problems.
Don't even offer him a drop of liquor.
He is very upset.
Really...?
- He is joking.
Bye.
What is so personal you want to discuss?
A small favour.
Favour...?
For you? From me?
Tell me what it is.
There is something.
We'll talk about it having a beer?
- No.
It should not be discussed with drinks.
l thought of coming to your house
& discuss it.
What is so serious about it?
lt's about bringing a new girl
into this profession.
We've our own place.
Lets go there & talk.
lf we stay here,
unnecessary thoughts will disturb us.
That will create problems,
which in turn makes things more difficult.
Come..
l think this is the address.
Read it.
Clara.- Yes.
Who is this Clara?
ls she into this profession?
lf she is in this profession,
why would l disturb you?
She wanted to come to this profession
through me.
What for?
- For livelihood, what else?
She wanted to get out of
that house in a nice way.
l & her step mother made a plan for that.
That's why l'm giving you this address.
What should we do with this address?
We have to write a letter to this address,
as if Mother Superior
of a church around here.
Should l write the letter?
l came for your help
because l'm an illeterate.
What should Mother Superior write?
l'll tell you.
But before that,
you must know who she is,
who are her relatives & more.
When did you first see her?
l met her in this town a year back,
in a group which had come for an excursion.
l noticed her then.
l saw her last week.
Just because l'm old, no one suspects me.
That's how l met her.
- Then what?
Her mother is dead. She lives with her father.
And her qualification?
- She had failed in her pre-degree.
Her father is a drunkard.
Because of that,
she has financial problems at home.
She has a step-mother.
Her step-mother's children
are her only relatives.
Have you been to her house?- Yes.
l met her step-mother.
- Then...?
She was expecting a person like me.
She had planned to bring Clara
to this profession long back.
First get Clara
join the christian missionary.
We got her father's permission too.
This letter is to convince him and
her uncle.
Letter from the missionary.
On seeing the letter,
she will come out.
We shouldn't go there for some days.
l had promised her step mother
that l'll give the letter.
l don't know how to write
like a mother superior.
lt is just a formality.
lt'll be fine.
But still, we do need their letter head,
don't we?
That's not a matter of concern.
lf nothing works out,
we'll print one.
l'll come tomorrow morning with all these.
You be ready with the contents.
As that boy said, go home
& don't drink any lime juice.
''May god bless you''
To dear Clara,
l was very happy to read your letters.
By god's grace, l'm happy to inform you that
you've been selected to serve god.
You & your step-mother
must come to the missionary on 23rd.
Your step-mother can stay here
for a couple of days.
We feel very happy on your growth.
While coming, bring snacks to eat.
Clara...
You shouldn't have been
so rude to him.
What else can l do?
There is a limit to everything.
He is both stingy & shameless.
Since l was so rude to him,
he won't disturb me anymore.
After his visit to college,
boys have something to talk about.
Now boys have given me a nick name.
- Nick name?
lt has started.
- What do they call you?
Really?
Shit!
Did Jaikrishnan of Mannarthuudi
met you in college?
Yes. How did you know that?
Brother of a girl studying there told me.
So, that has become the hot news, ah?
Radha, come inside.
l wonder what else is going
to happen. Rogue!
When l told him to get lost,
he started to blabber like a lunatic.
That's all.
He must be knowing
that you are my sister.
He knows & he even told me.
lf he approches you again,
inform me.
Approch? He won't come near me.
He got very nicely from me.
He must be after someother girl by now.
No. You must be careful at this point.
l know him for many years.
l can narrate you 100 different stories
about him.
But this is first time
Jayakrishnan has approched a girl.
The first time.
l think, since you had been very rude
to him, he must have felt hurt.
Not even his close friends
can predict his next move.
Once he takes a decision,
he never steps back.
He has people to do anything
for him in this town.
Do you know that?
That's why l'm telling you,
if he approaches you at anytime,
inform me.
Got it?
Now you can go.
l don't recognize you.
Mannarkudi Jayakrishnan...
- This is his house.
He is inside. l'll call him.
Please sit inside.
Where are you coming from?
- Actually...
l haven't seen you before.
l come here very rarely.
Master.....
how come you are here?
Mother, don't you know Kurukkal master?
He was my teacher
when l was in 5th class.
Kurukkal master.
lt's been very long since we met.
How did you remember me now?
Please sit inside. Come.
Sit...please sit.
What would you like to have?
Coffee or horlicks?
No thanks.
No way. You must have something.
Tea. You don't drink tea, do you?
very good memory.
The same old kid.
He is stubborn even now.
We can give him a lime juice.
ls that enough?
Yes, that's enough.
Would you like to have tender coconut?
No. Lime juice is enough.
The girl has come.- Who?
Clara.
Mother, do you have oats?- Yes.
Mix it with banana & bring it.
Master is very hungry.
He felt little shy to tell you.
Till then,
l'll show him our house & lands.
She is with her step-mother.
You must also do me another favour.
You must find out what's in her heart.
How can l?
l came for your help because
l don't trust anyone else.
lf l could get her,
my business will go on even
if l don't have other girls.
She'll also be profited.
very huge profits.
But we have find out whether
she will stay with me.
Don't you know how to keep girls
under your custody?
l think it is difficult in her case.
What do you want me to do?
Nothing much.
Come with me to town.
lf possible,
stay for a couple of days.
Tell your mom that l've a problem
to be solved & come with me.
You must find out what's in her heart.
What do you mean?
l want to know whether if someone
offers her a bungalow & a car,
will she accept that offer
& go with him?
Ideal job for me !!!
What contractor?
- Punnoose contractor.
Don't change the name.
Punnoose contractor.
Please get inside.
This is the best suit available.
Please sit.
Punnoose contractor,
didn't l tell you?
Yes...
Where is she?
There she is.
Punnoose contractor.
A big timber merchant.
Please sit.- No, l like to stand.
Please come here.
- Come & sit here.
Shall l order for soda?
Yes.
What's it?
l've seen people drinking in the evenings,
but you....
lt is funny to her.
She thinks l'm talking
about her drunkard father.
What's your name?
My real name is Glory.
But everyone including her father
calls me Beatrice.
Since everyone call me that way,
it has become my name.
Now, l like that name.
They will bring soda in a moment.
The brief...
Are you going to be here
till the soda comes?
Oh! No way.
That's 310. This is 31 1 .
lf you need anything, just call.
Your daughter is very lucky.
One should fall in the
right hands to come up in life.
Who do you think he is?
- ls he very rich?
lf he likes her, he'll treat her like a queen.
lt's true.
l'll meet you later.
Why haven't you fallen in love till now?
lt isn't true, is it?
Why should l lie to you?
So, you never felt like falling in love.
What is the reason?
- How do l know?
The men l met aren't qualified for that.
Am l qualified?
What is the use of it?
You've a wife & children.
What should l ruin your happy family life?
l will ask you something.
Will you tell me the truth?
Go ahead.
ls it your own decision?
- Yes.
What is the reason?
I didn't ask you the reason
for coming here?
Did I ?
No.
You had this before, right?
l didn't expect that.
l expected something different.
From the day l knew,
it is quarrel everyday.
l was fed up with my life.
So...
Quarrel with whom? ls it Beatrice?
l used to quarrel much with her frequently.
She fights with me for every reason.
First she used to beat me.
When l lost control,
l slapped her once.
After that incident,
we fight everyday.
And l started winning.
lf l have to live in that house,
l must chose this profession.
They themselves are finding ways
to push me in to this profession.
Do you want to be saved from getting ruined?
Anyway, l will get ruined.
Then I can get ruined in a prestigous way.
And l can die after fulfulling
all my desires, right?
l think you didn't open the briefcase.
Here is what you told me to buy.
l don't know whether
this is what you asked for.
Just a second.
Are you telling the truth?
- Yes.
She hadn't been touched
by a man till now.
She was a virgin, I know.
Even I didn't expect that.
May be she was waiting for you.
l should'nt have done that.
You must rather feel lucky.
Forget it.
Did you find out what's in her mind?
Were you not able to find out
or was she very stubborn?
l never asked.
And she is not easily understandble.
l knew that.
That's why l sought your help.
l don't think I can do that.
Everygirl coming to this profession
has a soft story.
l'll lose before her.
Everything will be alright.
First you open the briefcase.
The mood will change. Come.
l forgot to ask you.
We know each other
for more than 5 yrs, right?
Yes.
There are lot many stories between us.
You used to trap others
in such situations.
But in this, you got trapped, right?
Like her,
is this the first time for you too?
Yes.
l'll get you a beautiful bungalow.
A bungalow costing Rs. 7 - 8.
Rs. 8 means, a cartboard house?
Rs. 8 means 8 lacs.
Grinder, mixie, Tv...
a fully furnished house.
And a Maruthi...
a green coloured one.
To girls like you,
Maruthi is the best.
Maruthi is enough.
Will you teach me how to drive?
Sure..
Are you making fun of me?
- No.
You didn't have a drop of liquor.
You made me drink a bottle of whisky
and enjoying?
Dear, are you enjoying?
You don't have to enjoy that way.
Lets go to the beach
Beach?
Beach behind this coconut groove.
A beautiful beach.
l don't want to go.
Don't be crazy.
Breathing fresh air
in the beach means crazy to you?
In the evenings, it is ok.
But at night, it is crazy.
ls this the law?- Yes.
Lets break that law.
Come.
Why are you rubbing against me?
Everyone here know you, right?
- Yes.
What would the hotel men think about you?
Who cares what they think about us?
Now, l'm going to buy this hotel.
Want to see that?
What hotel is this!?
Full of steps.
Why are repeating the same thing?
Because you didn't give me perfect reply.
l don't want to be your keep.
ls that enough?
What's the reason?
- Reason.....
I know that there are many people waiting
to make me their keep.
Let me count the number of people
who wants me.
Even if l wish to,
Why should I become
a timber contractor's keep?
l can rather search for richer customer, right?
very greedy.
- What did you say? Come again
very greedy!
O timber merchant!
Who are you? Tell me the truth.
l know whatever you said from morning
till now are lies.
Even knowing that,
l told you the truth about me.
But we both can to be united.
lf you tell me the truth,
it'll be useful for both of us.
Tell me the truth.
Everything will come good.
It was me...
It was me...
It was me... mother superior.
l guessed.
lf Radha wasn't rude to me,
l wouldn't have met Clara.
l might have met you,
but not this way.
l had controlled myself all these years
without losing to any woman.
Was to give myself
to a woman l liked.
From now on,
l'm afraid that l may try everyone.
Nothing like that.
You meet Radha once more.
Not in the college.
But somewhere else.
No way....
She will come.
One day she will in Mannarthodi.
With 3-4 children just like you.
And l will come to see that.
Some admance... some believes.... some bad habbits..
l'm a mixture of all these.
l knew it.
And today,
Clara broke my stubborness.
l never wanted to be the firstman
to spoil a girl's life.
l never wanted to take away
a girl's virginity.
lf that happens, l had taken a vow
to make her my life partner.
Shall I marry you, Clara?
You don't have any problem,
do you?
No.
But you have to join us (joins our cast).
What do you mean?
- To go into the sea.
We'll go.
lt's not enough if you go.
While coming back,
there should be something in the net.
ls it enough if you have anything
in the net?
No...
Then...?
l want the boat full of...
The clouds get denser.
The desires start to pour.
With whom we begin ourjourney,
with whom we share our pain,
with whom we share our life,
we never know.
You made me forget the heat of
this summer. You're my destiny.
You made me forget the heat of
this summer. You're my destiny.
The dreams start to sprout
on a new relationship,
and bloom there on.
lt then grows & becomes a big jungle.
The clouds get denser,
the desires start to pour,
and l hear a new melody in my heart.
As the sea becomes rough,
the pearls shine.
As the sea becomes rough,
the pearls shine.
lt's an ever lasting melody
which gives birth to a new tune.
The clouds get denser.
The desires start to pour.
and l hear a new melody in my heart.
With whom we begin ourjourney,
with whom we share our pain,
with whom we share our life,
we never know.
The clouds get denser.
The desires start to pour.
and l hear a new melody in my heart.
Do you remember what l said?
l didn't say that because
l was in a romantic mood.
You know, right?
l'll be back soon.
l'm not going anywhere.
l advice you not to take
any hasty decision.
She will only see you for
next few days.
Not for just few days. 
Forever...
For the first time, l fell in love with a girl.
She left me.
l made love with another girl.
And if she also leaves....,
l will ruin myself.
l know myself better than you do.
l treat you as my elder brother.
Don't try to make business out of her.
l'll bear all your loses.
She will come to Mannarthudi.
Talk to her step-mother
& take a proper decision and do help me.
Be as my elder brother
& help us in getting married.
What is it, Andappa?
A boy from the hotel came
& asked you to go there immediately.
Has it been raided?
Not raid. But something else.
That lady is creating problems.
You came in taxi, right?- Yes.
You don't have to come.
- No, l will.
My daughter left without informing me.
Don't shout like this.
Oh my daughter...
Where did she go?
- Who knows?
When l came & saw, she wasn't here.
He says that she left a while ago.
l saw my daughter only yesterday.
l never saw her after that.
You must find my daughter
& bring her back to me.
l brought my daughter to you.
Don't shout.
- l will shout.
Let the police come
& find out where you've hidden my daughter.
l say don't talk.
Damodaran, tell me what really happened?
She escaped from this place.
Did you see her leaving?
- Yes, l saw.
That's why l'm able to tell you.
She left after 30 mins. after you left.
We thought you both had
come to an understanding.
Where might she had gone?
She might have gone somewhere.
She asked for train timings before leaving.
The manager told me.
When is the train?
The trains would have left early morning.
She left on that time.
Are you telling the truth?
l can say this in any court.
ls that enough?
O lord! Hope she is safe.
Come with me. l've to talk to you.
Shall l search in the railway station?
You go & search.
But l don't think we can find her.
She is very clever.
l knew that.
He didn't say a word about this to me.
He might have felt shy.
The other day,
he told me that he likes Radha.
But l never expected this.
Mad! He could've have told me.
Did he ever enquire about Radha
after that incident?
He & his busy schedule!
He is busy with farming, coconut business
and sometimes goes to Guruvayoor temple.
He would've forgetton that long back.
But she is directly opposite to him.
You mean Radha?
- Yes.
She had some assumption about him.
Only she knows what it is.
After that incidient,
l & Madhavan told her a lot about Jaikrishnan.
Anyway, she feels guilty.
She thinks she shouldn't
have been so rude to him.
She planned to talk to him today, 
if he comes.
When he didn't turn up,
she felt bad.
What should l do now?
Do one thing.
Talk to him & send us his horoscope.
lf the horoscopes match,
l'll take care of the rest.
Baskaran uncle is so adamant on such things.
You know him, right?
That is the reason.
l don't want to give my horoscope to anyone.
l don't want to get married in that way.
This is an usual custom.
Let them go ahead.
Or else, we'll get her horoscope.
- I said no...
If they are ready without checking horoscope match,
this marriage will happen.
Tell them that l said this.
What does she think of herself?
After doing all such nonsense .....
What are you doing, Jaikrishnan?
After she said she doesn't like you,
you had lime juice in front of me.
l saw your plight.
Now she likes you, why are you
creating unnecessary problems?
What's your problem?
l've no problem.
To fall in love....
and express love to her....
And she would either accept 
or reject it.
These things happens in everyone's life.
l know that.
lt should've happened at the age of 20.
Those are lost golden moments.
Being the son of Justice Thambooran,
l had no freedom.
No freedom to fall in love too.
lf the girl we like rejects our love,
then it is a shame.
But now she likes you.
No Rishi. Now she is not in my mind.
lf our horoscopes don't match,
it will again cause pain.
Why get disturbed unnecessarily?
So, I am in trouble.
Even she says she doesn't want to
match horoscopes.
Only you must tell this to Jaikrishnan.
Then l am in trouble, not you.
Why is she so stubborn all of a sudden?
The main reason is you.
Don't stare.
lt was you who created a good image
about him in her mind.
What did l say?
You told that he has an 
underworld connections.
And he can do anything.
l thought he would create
some problems.
When she knew that
he didn't create any problem,
she started to gather information
about him.
From friends, college staff
& from me.
Bus owner Babu's neice
is her classmate.
When enquired about him, many stories were unfolded.
Night trips,
going elsewhere
rather than going to Guruvayoor.
very lavish,
making people fall in traps.
When she found that Jaikrishnan
is different from what he is,
she got curious.
She says Jaikrishnan is neither of these.
What happened to her?
Jaikrishnan does not want to marry her
after horoscope match, right?
And this statement has made
him a hero to her.
Even if he agrees,
l wonder how l'm going to
convince my father.
Relative's marriage or any marriage..
my father checks the horoscopes match secretly.
l told her.
But nothing bothers her.
l did a foolish thing by going
to college on that day. But...
No need to tell me.
l know you from college days.
Though you know many girls,
I am sure that this will be your first love.
l told this to Radha too.
My mood at that time
& my mental distress now...
Do onething.
Talk to her directly.
That's good rather than beating around the bush.
Come home & talk to her.
- l can't.
After all this,
l can't even think about that.
Then, how?
On every Tuesdays & Fridays,
she goes to vadakumnathan temple,
early morning.
Believe in god atleast for a day.
l came to college & expressed my love,
because of my extreme affection to you.
l thought of giving you a surprise
& win your heart.
Thats what happened.
That's why l started liking you.
But...
On that day, l had the right to
express my love to you.
lf l had seen a fraction of affection
towards me in your eyes,
l would've taken you to a registrar's
office & married you.
Then I was totally free,
I was prepared.
At that time, you were the
only one in my heart.
But now, it is not the same.
You told me to remain disturbed, didn't you?
lt has happened as you said.
Who is that?
She came from nowhere
& vanished into thin air.
Don't know where she went?
- No.
Then, let her go.
- lt's not like that.
She came to this town because l wrote a letter to her.
And l spoiled her.
l became the reason
for her to take a wrong path.
All my stubborness
& arrogance has vanished into thin air.
l think that we were bonded
by god in some birth.
Or else, it wouldn't have be
possible to lose myselft to her?
l still remember,
When l wrote the letter to her, it was raining.
Again when we met, it was raining.
what's her name?- Clara.
What happened to Beatrice?
Thangalam & Andappan
gave her some money & sent her away.
She would've told the villagers,
that clara has joined the missionary.
lf Clara had accepted,
wouldn't you have married her?
l swear by the Sun,
l would've married her.
Then, why did she go away? Poor girl!
Even you didn't understand me first, right?
Agreed.
Both of you said ''NO'' to me.
But there was only one difference.
When you said ''NO'',
there is a family to back you up.
But she had none.
And she had gone somewhere
not knowing where she is heading to.
But after thinking for a while,
l understood that she didn't
go away from me,
but it was from her life and
from her step-mother,
and from the clutches of the Thangal.
l praise her for her brilliance
l accept her move.
But Clara will come back.
l think she will come back for me.
Why do you think so?
Just an intuition.
My such intuitions hasn't gone wrong till now.
lf she comes...
l don't think she will come.
What if she comes...?
lf she comes...?
- lf she comes...?
Even l'm not sure what l should do.
lf you meet Clara now,
she'll not be the same old Clara.
l know it will not be like that.
lf you get fixed to it,
you'll not see Clara anymore.
And you will never see her.
ls it true?- Yes, it is.
You will see for yourself.
l know why you are taking me to backwaters.
Try your tricks with someone else
& not with me.
Why are you shouting?
l only asked you to see that place.
l can see that place only if l'm interested.
You decide after seeing that.
Go & see. Buy it only if you like it.
l don't want to see anything.
l'm not interested to see that place.
Do you want me & my children
get washed away in the floods?
lt will never happen.
What kind of a person are you?
Are you trying to hurt me?
lf anyone desires to chase me out,
the desire will remain a desire.
What is the matter? Enough.
Nothing.
l want to show him the
land near the backwater.
Why should l see the land?
Am l a surveyor to see the land?
lf you like that land, l can dump you there.
That's what l'm telling you.
l don't want to get dumped.
Since l'm poor,
you think you can do anything.
lt is very sad.
lf you are ready to throw me
in the backwaters in broad daylight,
what happened to law & order
in this country?
lf you shout anymore,
l'll throw you into the sea.
Where is my sickle?
Why do you want to talk to him?
- Leave me.
Father, don't kill us.
l'll kill everyone.
l'll kill everyone here itself.
Get inside.
l'll make Mannarthudi a cemetry.
Stop shouting.
Do onething.
Take this & kill everyone of us.
Kill me...
Why are you behaving like an idiot?
Come.- Kill me.
Lets go.
l've been living in this village all these years.
l won't leave this place.
You can't make that happen.
l sang the first raga,
l search for the one & only you.
You came to the vadakunathan temple yesterday.
l sing about you.
My search is for you.
O dove! Even god is your ardent lover.
l sang the first raga,
l search for the one & only you.
You came to the vadakunathan temple yesterday.
l sing about you.
My search is for you.
O dove! Even god is your ardent lover.
l walk through this holy place
and worship early morning for us to remain united forever.
l walk through this holy place
and worship early morning
for us to remain united forever.
Our eyes chanting the hymns,
our silence singing the devotional songs.
We can see all these in this holy place.
l sang the first raga,
l search for the one & only you.
You came to the vadakunathan temple yesterday.
l sing about you.
My search is for you.
O dove! Even god is your ardent lover.
The long nights go hand in hand with the sleep.
The doors of the temple inside my heart are open.
The long nights go hand in hand with the sleep.
The doors of the temple inside my heart are open.
The girl you were the other day
and the girl you are today are totally different.
lt's the miracles of time.
l sang the first raga,
l search for the one & only you.
You came to the vadakunathan
temple yesterday.
l sing about you.
My search is for you.
O dove! Even god is your ardent lover.
What are you doing?
Go there & dig.
Someone is coming.
A telegram.- ls it for me?- Yes.
Meet my mother & go.- Okay.
Why is it raining off season?
See her if you want to.
Or else don't see her.
This is exam time for Radha.
Don't tell this to her & upset her.
When is the train arriving?
- 3:30 am.
lt will be very cold.
Anyway l will go.
She would be expecting me.
Else Why should she remember only me?
She might be having a busy schedule.
You got early morning slot.
Let it be.
She has allocated me time
in the early morning.
She would expect me in the station.
l have to be there at that time.
What is it?
Why are you staring at me? (In Telugu)
Men don't allow us to walk freely
even during ealry mornings. (In Telugu)
When will you learn
as how to behave with a girl? (In Telugu)
Don't you have mother, sister?
(In Telugu)
This country is becomig
worse day by day. (In Telugu)
Last week, i was in Andhra.
l was Jamuna Rani
who knew only Telugu.
This was only a continuation of it.
Now, it will become alright.
Did you get my telegram?
- What question is that?
Without getting telegram,
why would l be waiting
on this platform at this hour?
You always sleep here, right?
Stop talking & take my bag.
Where are we going now?
You tell me where to go.
We're not going anywhere.
We are only going for a walk.
At this hour?
- Yes. We are two.
l love to walk.
Because l'm fed up living
between four walls.
Lets walk, contractor.
Lets walk till dawn.
Where is he taking
her to at this hour?
She makes my dick stiff.
Do the villagers have license
to talk like this at midnight?
Forget it.
lf anyone wants to take me,
let them take.
Lets walk.
- Shall l hire a taxi?
No need. Just walk.
While joining the missionary,
l took a photo.
To send it home.
Want to see that?
lt looks funny.
How do l look?- very good.
A very suitable attire
for beautiful girls like you.
You mean to say this
is best suitable dress for me.
lf not this, you will look beautiful
without any clothes.
Can we find a place,
where we can stay not like prisoners.
That....
House with a small verandah 
& a soothing breeze.
l can't stay in rooms anymore.
Earlier as l hated my life,
now l hate rooms.
Walls! Walls everywhere.
The walls of bedroom, sideroom & bathroom.
Walls everywhere.
After that,
Walls in the moving cars & trains.
l need to ask my friends
for any vacant house.
We don't need much facility.
l want to see the sky, day & night.
That's enogh.
There is a house, but will Clara come?
Nobody lives there.
But it is Thangal's house.
You remember Thangal, don't you?
Okay, lets go there.
But is better we don't see him.
Are you scared?
- No. But l'm not interested to see him.
l can't face him because
l had cheated him.
He is inside.
Park the car. l'll be back soon.
Taxi driver knows the place.
There is no facility.
because nobody lives there.
lt's okay.
lf you need anything...
A boy living below will come.
He'll get you anything you need.
Will you stay there for a couple of days?
l don't know.
The girl...
Did she enquire about me?
She doesn't want to see you.
She is waiting in the car.
No need to see me.
Wonderful!
l should've come here
on that day itself.
l ran away from this place.
But today, l begged for the key.
What's that noise?
l heard that earlier too.
A mad man's cry!
A mad man lives near by.
He has been chained for many days.
The boy said, since the mad man was
chained, his legs got bruised.
When the chains brush the wound,
he cires in pain.
l like to be the mad man's wound.
A wound which have contact only with that chain.
Why did you tell her about me?
There wasn't any need.
l had only our story to tell her.
So l did.
Should not have told her.
lt would've created an
unwanted disturbance to her.
Radha is afraid of only one girl.
And that's you.
lf l knew this, l wouldn't have come here.
Yes.
Over here.
lt will be cold by now.
How is it?
- A bit cold but too spicy.
lt's very far.
lt takes time to come here.
so, it will get cold.
l'll leave.
l always remember you,
whenever l see a new face.
The number of faces keep growing, right?
As the numbers increase,
one day you will forget mine.
Will I forget?
Yes, you will.
But l don't want to forget.
While coming, l thought,
if you propose to marry me,
what should l do?
But l knew that such a question
will not be raised again.
If I have asked?
You didn't ask, right?
I don't know whether you noticed...
We spoke a lot about Radha this time.
lt's good.
One must be lucky to marry
their first love.
Only good people will get such a chance.
Whom did Clara love at first sight?
lt is the contractor.
The first & the last.
Who is he?
- A marwadi boy.
When l met him for the first time,
he forced me to marry him.
Just like us.
What?
The boy brought his parents,
but l ran away from there.
Who is he having offices in all the states?
ls he a Malayalee?
- Yes. From Muvatupuzha.
But he got settled in Hyderabad long back.
Regular friend?
- l can't say like that.
But he too wants to marry me now.
ls he a Bachelor play boy?- No.
His wife died in an accident.
ls he an old man?
Hey Kid... you contractor....
Why are you asking such unnecessary questions?
I was just thinking....
It didn't rain this time, as we met.
Which means we won't meet again, right?
No...
Why should we meet again?
- l don't know.
But don't leave me saying
that we'll not meet again.
My visit shouldn't be a
trouble to Radha.
No. - Radha shouldn't know
about our meeting.
No, she won't.
Lets not get seperated saying
that we'll not meet again.
But someday we will have to part ways.
How do you know that?
l know.
Only till Radha comes to Mannarthudi,
you can meet me.
Shall l go now, Mr. Contractor?
In this period, nasty desires, happiness
& a couple of girls came in my life.
There l stood as myself.
But l know, if Clara comes into my life...
What if Clara comes...?
She came & went away.
She is gone.
She won't come back again.
Even if she comes, please don't meet her.
will you go?
You won't go.
l...
Promise me that you won't meet her again.
l...
Promise me now
& you can break that without my knowledge.
What is the use then?
There is use,
Promise me.
l promise.
Even you can't break your promise.
Then, l've escaped.
- Now l promise.
lf you break your promise,
or if l know that you've broken,
Radha will not be yours.
Babu, can we finish him off?
- Yes, we can.
lt's better, right?
- Yes.
Okay get up.
Whom are you going to finish?
lt's Raman Unni Nair.
We're going to finish him off.
Lets go.
How are we going to finish him off?
We've decided to finish him off. Lets do it.
How can we step back?
Will you go there
& kill him straight away?
No.
We'll tie his legs
& hands & bring him here.
We'll throw him from the dam.
What do you say Babu?
Then, there is another problem.
He lives with his wife & children.- Yes.
Won't they scream?
On hearing their scream,
the villagers will surround us.
Babu, stop the car.
There is a way.
Can we burn his house?
Won't everyone run for their lives?
when they are in a confusion,
we can bring him here,
and dump him in the dicky.
lt'll be a confusion all over
when the house is on flames.
Which was the car? Who took him?
That's a good idea.
ls everything ready?
- Yes.
Who is there?
lt's me.- What do you want?
ls there any problem?
Come here, Mr. nair.
A small problem.
l was wondering to see a car at midnight.
What are you doing here at this late hour?
Open the door.
Take your hands off from his mouth.
Lets see whether he will shout.
Don't kill me.
lf you shout, l'll kill you.
l'll move from that place.
l'll kill you. Don't shout.
Now, you don't need
to move from that place.
We are going to throw you in to the dam.
Oh my god! Save my children.
Shut his mouth with a cloth.
No need of that. l won't shout anymore.
You shouldn't.- No l won't.
Can l pray?- yes.
We can put him on the floor.
Stab him.
lf l kick you, you'll fly like a football.
When will you move from that place?
- By tomorrow.
Do you know where you've to go?- l know.
Where?- As Menon told.
Don't change your mind tomorrow.
No.
Can you find the way back to your house?
- l know.
How do you know?- l know.
How do you know?- l said l know.
Do you want us to drop you there?
l can go by myself.
No one should know about this.
No.
Not even my children will know about this.
Then, can we leave him?
Should we leave him 
just like that?
Did he leave that place after that?
He's going to move.
Work has started to build a new house.
Father gave this place to
Malani Sister to build a house.
Sister has no one.
lt is difficult to stay somewhere all alone.
lf he didn't agree to move,
would you kill him?
l won't.
Thank god everything went fine.
Or else this problem would have
continued for a long time.
Atlast, everything ended in peace.
Mother doesn't know about this, does she?
Mother feels your arrival is a good sign.
Raman changed his mind
and was ready to move from there.
That's good.
But l'm not talking about that.
This should've been done 5 yrs. back.
Who?- Both of you.
Everything needs time.
You don't have to take it so lightly.
lf it is not so, you should've come
to Mannarthudi 1 1/2 yr back.
Why did you come so late?
Why didn't that happen?
So, this is good.
You too checked it?
Yes...
Apart from me,
l've also asked Nanuezhuthachan
to look into the horoscopes.
And the surpise thing is that,
he too has seen such matching
horoscopes very rarely.
lt is because of our good deeds.
Radha's exams got over last week.- yes.
He told.
So, you are also interested
to perform this marriage soon.
Father, have you fixed the auspicious hour?
Auspicious dates are plenty
for the next two months.
Most of the marriages are
performed in these 2 months.
Lets fix a date which is
convenient for both the families.
Only the venue has to be fixed.
That's enough, ah?
That's why you bought a car.- Yes.
And also to go round with the new bride.
You need petrol to run a car.
l know.
You shouldn't become a
Thambooran of Mannarthudi then.
You shouldn't say that
bus is better for us.
lf you are very scared,
postpone your marriage.
Only after becoming a husband,
we'll know about your stingy character.
Now you are very lavish.
C'mon, please stop it.
To be frank, only after her exams,
Radha has become a free bird.
lf l were Radha,
l would've agreed
for marriage only after a year.
Still, l don't have any problem.
What? Don't have any problem?
You've to pay for that too.
Yes, it is Jaikrishnan speaking.
Where are you calling from?
- From a far off place.
ls it raining there?
- No.
But it is raining here.
Marriage over?
- No.
As you said, Radha's exams
must be over by now.
Yes, her exams are over.
So, was Clara counting the days?
Yes, 
why are you delaying your marriage?
It will happen in next month.
We are busy to fix the date.
So, are you sure it will happen next month?
Do you remember we had a promise.
We can meet till Radha
comes to Mannarthudi.
l do remember.
l'm coming.
l'll inform you about the time
& date in a telegram.
Just like before.
Will you really come or not?
l will come.
When l say l will come, l mean it.
She is coming on 1 7th. By 3:30 pm train.- Yes.
Today is saturday. Only 4 more days.
At Ottapalam station.
When she phoned me,
l had a doubt that she'll come.
That's why l didn't tell you
about her phone call.
You have the freedom
not to meet her.
l do have the freedom, but...
l don't know what to do.
l don't know how to react
in this girl's matter.
What is your suggestion?
lt is your wish.
Your father & uncle were waiting
for you to come.
Do you have anything else to say?
lf you are so hesitating...
They don't need to go there.
What if the date is not fixed today.
We can have it after a week.
You can go there after l tell you to go.
what are you saying, my dear?
That's enough.
Anyway, 1 1/2 yrs. has passed away.
A week more will make no difference.
lf you fix the date without my permission,
the marriage won't happen in that date.
No point in trying to convince me, sister.
You're creating a problem on your own,
spoil your name in the village,
and when the decision is made,
you disagree.
ls it a joke?
Even after asking her many times,
she didn't say anything.
No need. She will remain here always.
No need to think about anyother alliance.
Nowadays, girls go out with their fiance
and finally disagree with the marriage.
So be it.
Whenever l spoke about marriage,
she was angry with me.
What happened to that now?
Till now she was hurrying for marriage.
What happend to her now?
ls there any problem between you two?
- Nothing.
Then, why did she say so?
How did you come?- By taxi.
My mom won't allow me to sit at home.
She asked me to talk to you.
Now our home looks very odd.
Madavan, you go.
l'm coming to town.
l'll talk to Radha.
May be this is our last meeting...
May be she is coming here
to wish me good bye...
l already told you. You can do as you wish.
l won't do anything l feel wrong.
lf l don't meet her after seeing the telegram,
then it will be my mistake.
l didn't tell you to goto railway station.
- Then?
You try to remember. You'll come to know.
She knows about it only when l told her.
l know people
who hides a lot.
Why did you tell her?
- Because l was sincere.
lf she can't understand that,
she doesn't have to come to Mannarthudi.
l need a girl who understands me.
Let it be Clara or Radha.
l don't want anyone to come here at this hour.
l said no.
l don't want to talk to you.
Then, why come here?
l won't be here. That's it.
Who was that?
- Madhavan.
He wants to talk to me.
He said he is coming with his friends.
You can't talk like that.
- What else can l talk?
l can talk like this only.
Your anger & talk are crossing limits.
With whom are you going to create problem?
What did she tell you?
Radha, come with me.- For what?
l want to talk to you.
Go ahead.
- l can't talk about it here.
That's why l'm asking to come with me.
Get inside.
l'll drop you back.
lt won't be late.
Come.
She is Mrs. Babu.
You know them, right?
You can sit upstairs.
- Go upstairs.
Come.
Come. Let play the elephant game.
Why are playing at this time?
Get lost.
- Can't you keep quiet.
Get lost.
l can understand your doubts.
Like the register marriage, you want to
know whether this is valid or not?
Yes. - lt is valid. This is it.
We have the seal, inkpad & the peon.
Now, this is a registrar's office since l'm here.
You sign here & you, here.
Please come.
Official function can be later.
They can decide about that.
This is for my peace of mind.
Like you, even Clara also said something to me.
lf l become your husband,
Clara can't have me.
Today is 1 7th.- yes.
She is coming in the afternoon, right?
Yes.
Let her come & go.
Have this in mind.
lf l ever sign in a marriage register,
it will be next to your signature.
Otherwise, l will never sign.
l will sign on someother day, but not today.
This is only for my peace of mind.
- No need.
Either you drop me back, 
or let me go by auto.
Come. l'll drop you.
l thought you won't come.
- Why did you think so?
Because you're getting married very soon.
This time, it will happen, right?
That's why l came to see you.
lt will happen. lf not now,
it will never happen.
Why is it so?
- lt is like that.
Mr. Moni Joseph, my husband.
You know him, right?
Mother superior.
l know him.
l can't say like that.
But he wants to marry me.
A bachelor play boy?
No.
His wife died in an accident.
l've to get some water.
Don't cry.
When was your marriage?
A year back.
To be frank, after our last meeting,
A week after lisitening to that
mad man's cries.
lf l didn't do this, l feared that
our lives will be ruined.
We had passed by this place
a couple of times.
Why didn't you inform me.?
For you not to remember about me.
lf you don't see me, you can forget easily.
My wishes to you & Radha,
though l've not seen her.- l'll tell her.
Give my wishes to her.
But don't tell her about my visit.
Why should she get
worried unnecessarily?
