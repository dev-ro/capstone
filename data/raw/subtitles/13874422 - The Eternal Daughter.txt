But there was
something strange though,
because a few months later,
we were looking through
our wedding photographs
and there was a picture
of myself and my wife
at the front of the hotel.
And you could see
just behind us,
a figure of someone
looking out of the window.
Staring at us.
Really quite scary at the time.
- Nobody you could account for?
- Absolutely nobody.
- Oh, my goodness.
- And it turns out the room
was empty at the time.
So, I, uh...
I avoid the place on dark
winter nights.
Mum, we're here.
We've arrived.
Good evening.
We'd like to check in please.
Yeah, no problem.
- Uh, do you have a reservation?
- Yes.
- Great. What's the name?
- Hart.
Hart.
Mm.
When did you book?
I was gonna say that I...
made the reservation
um, several months ago.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I understand that.
I'm just... I'm just looking.
Just...
- Several months ago you said?
- Yeah.
- But I did ring last week...
- You did ring?
- Okay.
- ...to double check.
- Ah, here you go.
- Yes.
- Uh, Julie Hart, ground floor.
- That's right.
- No. Well, no, uh...
- With wheelchair access.
In fact, when I rang last week
it was to confirm that what we...
What we've reserved
is the first floor,
uh, facing the formal gardens.
Uh, no. There's nothing
here on my side.
Usually when people book
and they have a special request
- it's attached to the booking.
- Uh-huh. Yes.
Well, I imagine
he would have made a note of it.
Can you check
with your colleague maybe?
He's not here this evening.
Or, maybe even your manager.
It's just me for tonight.
But we're here tonight
and I reserved it.
Yeah, I get that.
So, would you be happy to stay
on the ground floor
just for tonight?
No, I'm afraid not, because
I reserved a first floor room.
Well I can't put you in a room
that I haven't got.
A lot of keys there.
Just one moment, please.
I mean...
I have one room that I can
give you just for tonight.
- Oh.
- That is on the first floor.
Oh.
Oh, that's very good. Um...
Well, maybe could I
see that room?
Yeah, you wanna see the room?
- Yes. Just check it out.
- I'll take you up.
And there's Wi-Fi throughout
the hotel, is there?
Uh, no, not throughout
the hotel.
If you want some signal,
best off going to the top
of the building.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.
Did you say that there was Wi-Fi
on this floor?
I mean,
there is Wi-Fi in the building,
but you only get signal
when you go up to the top.
I did reserve a table
in the restaurant for dinner.
H, no, you were
late so everything's closed.
- And here's your key. Thanks.
- Thank you.
And as soon as possible
it would be good to know
that we can be here
for the remaining nights.
Oh, God!
Getting our things in
a little bit of a muddle here.
Just get it all.
Here we are. Oops.
Now, no peeking.
No, I'm not looking.
I'm not looking.
Darling, don't you want
to take your coat off?
You must be boiling.
I just want
to get everything organized.
Oh, it's so good to be here.
I remember the ceiling.
And I think, uh,
I was in that bed.
My sister was in this one.
Look...
Oh, darling. Oh, no!
Oh, my Lord...
H, shit.
Come on.
All right, Mum. So, I'll see
if I can find a kettle.
- All right?
- All right, darling.
Louis, you stay here.
Stay with your mistress.
I won't be long.
Aren't you a good boy?
Yes.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Just one or two things.
- Yeah?
I'm wondering if there's any
clarity on whether or not
we can stay in our room
for the next few nights.
Um, I still don't know
about the room.
Oh, there's no way of expediting
that decision is there?
Uh, no. I can try and get back
to you later on today,
but I can't promise anything.
Sooner rather than later
would be much appreciated.
Yep.
Also, we don't seem
to have a kettle in our room.
- An electric kettle, please.
- Yep, I'll bring one up.
And, also, I had
a very unsettled night.
There was a sound.
I'm sure other people
have mentioned it to you.
A banging of some kind.
I imagine it was a window or...
Yeah. I mean, there's
no one staying above you.
Well, exactly.
I can't imagine anybody
would have been staying
in a room with that
because they wouldn't have
been able to sleep at all.
It was... And I don't know
if it was a window,
but it felt repetitive and...
Yeah, all night.
That's strange,
'cause nobody else
has mentioned anything at all
about any noise whatsoever.
- Really?
- Yeah.
That does surprise me.
It was pervasive.
Oh, well, anyway, um...
I would be very grateful
if you could make sure that
doesn't happen again tonight,
and check all the windows and...
All the windows?
Well, all the windows...
Especially in the rooms
that are not occupied,
because, obviously, the people
who are staying in the rooms
will be able to check
their own windows.
Yep.
I also have a message for you,
by the way.
Your cousin...
Alistair.
He wants you to go to lunch
with him on Sunday.
Oh, thank you very much.
So, lovely to hear
that we can stay in our room.
The checking of the windows...
...and, uh, and the kettle.
- Yeah, I'll bring the kettle up.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
- Thank you.
We don't want to go do we?
Just tell me,
what would you prefer?
Well, what do you feel?
No, Mum.
I want us to do what you want.
Oh, well I feel so awful
to say it, but...
It's not that I don't want
to see them, but I mean,
we're so cozy here, aren't we?
Yeah, I mean it's very selfish,
but I was rather hoping...
...we could be together.
If you can think
of a nice way of saying it,
I think it would be
really wonderful
- if we could just be us.
- Very good. I'll call him later.
I think that would be...
I think that would be the best.
You having a nice breakfast?
Very, very good marmalade.
So I'm gonna go and make a start
on my work.
Are you all right?
I'm perfectly fine,
thank you, darling.
I'm just gonna take my time
and then I'm gonna have a bath.
Do you want me
to run it for you?
- Mm.
- Really?
No, don't worry. I'll be fine.
You found a nice place to work?
Yeah, yeah, I think so.
I'm gonna give it a stab anyway.
It's not a problem...
I'm just...
in the middle of something.
Yeah.
Mum?
Mum?
I got you a nice glass of wine.
Thank you very much.
Oh, goodness me.
Are we early or late?
I mean...
Are we the only people
staying here?
Have you worked that out yet?
I know... I don't know. I...
There was no-one here
when I arrived.
Oh, look at that.
Thank you very much.
That's very welcome.
Are you ready to order?
Oh, I do apologize.
Haven't even had a look.
Uh, not quite,
I just, uh... gosh.
Shall I come back
in a couple of minutes or...
That would be kind.
'll come back
in a couple of minutes.
Thank you.
Ooh... Nice looking things.
What do you think, Mum?
What do you think?
I'm, um... I'm a bit torn
between the soup...
A carrot and coriander soup,
and the beetroot salad
sounds very nice.
Yeah, "Salad of heritage
beetroot, apple and Welsh feta."
Such... So nice when it's local.
I mean, I suppose
we could have...
...different things
on different nights.
Have you decided?
There's only four options.
I think I'll have the, um...
Yeah, I think I'll have
the beetroot salad to start.
- And then, uh...
- A main?
Yes and then followed
by the salmon.
Yeah.
And I'll have the same, please.
The beetroot salad...
...and the salmon.
- I'll bring it over.
- Thank you.
Darling,
will you stop doing that?
You must, must have enough
photographs of me by now.
Well, I gotcha.
So there.
What's in that bag, Mum?
Oh, just...
...things to go through.
Letters and, um...
and papers and photographs
and, uh...
Maybe there's...
stuff in it that...
that I would...
...value... that maybe
you wouldn't.
Well, I'm sure
you're very interested.
I can...
I can sense your interest.
I'm sure you think you're
going to want to
put it in a film at some point.
Let's just have a nice dinner.
Do you remember this room?
Yes, this was...
This was the drawing room.
And, uh... big, big sofas here.
Velvet ones.
Yeah.
And us children would jump
off the back of it.
We would jump from one
to the other.
See if we could make it.
Over a dog preferably.
Mm...
Did you have a good day,
darling?
Not great actually. Um...
Couldn't really get started.
I mean, I didn't sleep...
for a start and, uh...
I dunno. I'm, I'm...
I don't know,
I feel a little unsettled.
Nice to hear your voice.
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
I couldn't get a message
to you either.
Um... But, uh...
Oh, I mean, I don't know,
I started, you know.
I found a nice room and I...
...sat and looked
out the window.
It'll, you know,
it'll come, I suppose.
But, uh, it...
Oh, hang on, what's that...
Hello? Hello?
Oh, that's a bit better.
Yeah, I'm just gonna stand
by this bit of leaf.
Um...
Oh, hello?
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Oh, God.
Lou? There we are.
It's so lovely having you look
after me like this, darling.
And very spoiling.
Isn't it Louis?
Isn't it?
Aren't we having a lovely time?
Mm.
What are you doing?
Do you want to go out?
All right. Come on, come on...
Okay. Okay.
There's a good boy. Go on.
Go on, you told me
you wanted to come out.
Come on, come on.
Come on, do a pee.
Don't you want to do a pee?
Louis...
Come on, do something.
What were you saying to me?
You said you wanted to come out.
Huh? What is it?
Don't you want to do...
Oh, come on.
Hello?
I'm, I'm sorry.
We didn't mean to disturb you.
It's quite all right.
I hope you
and your mother are having
a very pleasant
and comfortable stay.
We are, yes. Thank you.
Very much so.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Come on...
There we are.
Oh, darling, thank you so much.
You're an angel.
I feel terrible taking you away
from your work like this.
Oh, no. I'll do it later.
This is a nice job.
Well, it's a great help.
I mean, I have a pile and
I really want to get them away
as soon as possible.
Maybe after lunch
we could post them.
Do you want to take one
of my little helpers?
I don't want to get dependent
on anything, so...
I... I understand, but just...
Just say the word.
I have them you know,
and I find they're marvelous.
They just...
You know, I go straight off.
No, I'll go for a longer walk
today and I don't know...
maybe drink less coffee.
I don't know. Anyway...
All right, so I've done
the Asbury's.
I've done Anne and
Michael Saxton-Thomas.
Um... uh...
Oh, uh, yes, Charles Stowe.
Did I tell you that Molly died?
So sad.
He was so sweet when, you know,
when he wrote me
such a lovely letter.
All right, uh,
let's get on with that.
With an "E" and "Esquire."
And you'll find the address
in there.
So nice by the fire.
Do you remember this room?
Was it like this
when you were here before?
Uh, do you know,
I was just thinking.
I remember the fireplace
very well. Um...
I remember being rather
frightened of it actually,
uh, when I was...
Yeah, I mean,
it's so funny isn't it,
to think that one
would be frightened, but I...
Although, I have happy memories
of this room.
Um, I think, uh, you know,
Aunt Jocelyn was, um...
...always filling it
with children.
And, uh, didn't have
any of her own,
but she, you know,
she took us in
and she took the cousins,
and yeah...
Happy times.
And... I mean,
did you, did you...
Were you aware
of the war going on?
Did you have bombers
going over or...?
Yeah... Well, I mean, you're not
far from Liverpool here,
so yeah there...
there were...
Darling, let's get on
with these cards.
- I mean, I...
- All right.
Can we? Do you mind?
Let's... I'm...
The truth is I feel
a bit wobbly today, so I just...
Oh, Mum!
No, just I dunno,
I just feel a bit sort of cold,
even though we're by the fire.
You look a bit cold.
Oh, would you like a scarf?
- I'll go and get you a scarf.
- No, well don't...
- Yeah. No, easy.
- I can do it darling.
- I'll get one later.
- No, no, no, I'll get it.
She's such a fusspot.
Isn't she?
Is your room nice,
where you've found to write?
Mm.
Didn't get any work done today.
Maybe it'll just take
a little time.
This was, um...
This is a room
I remember very well.
Um... it was a drawing room.
And, uh...
It was hung with tapestries.
I mean, real tapestries, not
what they have now but, um...
And, uh...
It had a needlepoint fireguard,
which my Aunt Joss had made.
We had it for a while.
I don't know where it is now.
The telephone was in this room,
and my aunt...
There was this one day
when my aunt, um...
There's a bag on the floor.
- Finished?
- Um... yeah. Yeah, okay.
- I'll bring in the main.
- Thank you.
Um...
And I remember her voice,
particularly.
Very low.
Oh, my cousins and I were
mucking about on the stairs,
and... and she
came out of the room
and made an absolute
beeline for me,
with this very serious look
on her face.
Which was rare, 'cause she was
a very merry soul generally.
Um...
Mm.
And there'd been this...
...news about Peter.
His, uh, plane had been lost
over the English Channel.
Yeah. And, um...
Mummy and Daddy
had the funeral in London
and they thought it best that
we stay here with Aunt Joss,
which we did. Um...
We went to the beach.
And my brothers, my...
my older brothers... they went.
They were old enough to go.
Mum, I'm so sorry.
Oh, darling, no.
I didn't know.
I feel so bad
for bringing you here.
That's what rooms do.
They, they hold
these stories and...
We're here now.
And that was then.
And, and there's just this
muddle in me,
of when... when it is, exactly.
- That's all.
- Well you always said
you had such happy memories here
and that's why I thought...
Oh, darling I did...
I did have happy memories here.
But I also had
other memories here.
I had all sorts
of memories here.
And they, they...
You know,
they're all still alive.
Battered cod.
Kitchen's closing soon.
Thank you.
That's quite a helping.
Could you help me with this?
I'm not sure that I could
manage all of that.
Oh, no, Mum!
Look how much I've got.
Just leave it
if you can't eat it.
I don't see a fish knife,
either.
Yeah, I don't know which one
we're supposed to use.
All right, let's see...
- I feel so bad.
- For what, my darling?
To bring you back to a place
which you have such
sad memories about. I mean...
I'm... I'm really sorry.
I wanted to come.
I'm so grateful to you
for bringing me.
This is a...
This is a lovely thing
for us to be here together.
I feel really bad
for coming now.
It's not your fault.
Mum, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Nothing's your fault.
Mmm.
I don't know.
I mean, it's not like any of us
could have done anything
to stop it.
So you just have to take it,
don't you?
You know, you can't regret it
because you didn't have
any say in it.
Mm.
I mean, that's what life's like.
Just...
You know,
you roll with the punches.
Why haven't you
been answering your phone?
Why haven't you been answering...
Alfie!
What's wrong with you?
Why you driving off?!
What is wrong with you?
What is wrong with you?
Oh, there you are. I'm so sorry.
It's even later this time.
Um... how are you?
Yeah, sorry, it's not very good.
Let me just go over here.
I think it's kind of best
up against the hedge.
Oh, oh, um...
Oh, I don't know, I'm actually
having a kind of bad day.
I'm having doubts
about the whole project.
I don't know,
I just feel so guilty.
I can't really explain it.
I mean, it's got something to do
with being here, but...
Oh, anyway, I...
Darling, you know, it's actually
really cold out here.
I think I'm gonna have to go in
and get Louis in.
So, uh, I'll call you tomorrow
when I can, okay?
I hope it'll be earlier.
What? Hello?
Are you all right, darling?
I'm fine, Mum. I won't be long.
You've been an awful long time.
Yes, my boy.
There we...
Louis?
Louis! Louis?
Louis!
Louis! Louis?
Louis!
Louis!
Louis!
Louis! Louis?
Are you all right?
Oh! I'm so sorry.
My... my mother's dog.
He's vanished. I don't know
where he's gone.
I'm sure he's not far away.
Louis!
Louis!
- Here, boy!
- Louis!
Come Louis! Come!
Louis?
Louis?
Louis?
Oh! Oh.
Now, you stay there.
Stay. Don't move.
I wanted to tell you,
he's found!
Oh, good!
And to thank you so much
for your help.
You're most welcome.
No, I feel awful
for having involved you.
Oh, it's perfectly all right.
So grateful. Thank you.
Well, we should celebrate.
Why don't you have a seat?
Well if...
if I'm not disturbing you.
- No.
- That would be lovely.
- Thank you.
- I'll be with you in a moment.
Thank you.
I'm so sorry.
Don't be.
He's back. He's safe.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
I'm Julie.
I'm Bill.
- William...
- Yes.
Was my father's name.
- Ah...
- Mm.
- He's no longer with us?
- No.
He, um... he died
a couple of years ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
My wife died about a year ago.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- She worked here.
- She was the chef.
- Oh.
We had about thirty some years
working in this place together.
And, um...
I could have retired,
but I decided to stay on.
Pretty much because of my wife.
And the memories that we have
of working here.
You might have heard me
playing the flute.
Um... something that I picked up
shortly after she died.
And so I sit in the office or in
the kitchen and I play for her.
Because I never played
for her before.
And, um, so it's like a new
chapter in our relationship.
And what do you do?
- I'm a filmmaker and I came...
- Ahh.
I came here, um,
with my mother to, um...
...to try and write a film
about my mother and I.
Ah.
But not easy.
Uh... I... I can't even
get started.
Why is that?
I...
I think I'm not sure I feel
I have a right...
...to do such a thing.
It feels like trespassing.
It's really difficult for me
to think of her being sad.
You know,
I want her to be happy.
I just want her to be happy
all the time.
There are memories
here that I...
...um, have with my wife
that are not happy.
Um...
I make my rounds.
And, of course...
that's the time when memories
flood back to me.
And I make my rounds
quietly in the evening.
Through the building and
on the grounds.
And I suppose it is a way of
staying in touch with my wife.
So I can understand
you wanting to make a film
about your mother to...
...keep that sense
of that relationship with her.
It's difficult, isn't it?
And I really am
so very, very grateful to you
- for all your kindness.
- Oh, you're most welcome.
You've really been
a great, great help.
I wonder, tomorrow, before
my mother's birthday dinner,
we're, we're going to have
a drink to toast her,
and I wondered if you'd like
to join us?
Oh, that's awfully kind of you,
but I have family business,
so I won't be
around tomorrow evening.
- But thank you so much.
- Not at all, I just...
- It was a thought.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Rest well.
Thank you.
Happy Birthday!
There was a time when, uh...
when... when we hoped that...
That they might, uh...
But, uh, but no.
- And now she has her work.
- Mm.
And she makes her films,
and they are...
...as time consuming, uh,
and as energy consuming
I would suggest,
as a... as a child might be.
- Oh, yes. Mm.
- Each one as they come along.
- Yes.
- Um... Yeah, I mean, uh...
I'm... I'm sad for her
that she doesn't have a child,
because I think
she would have... uh...
I was going to say she would
have been a wonderful mother,
but the truth is,
she is a wonderful mother.
- Mm.
- She has a great capacity for...
...practical, the practical
magic of love.
- Yes.
- You know, she does it well.
- Yes.
- And I'm, these days,
very much the recipient.
Well, I've always
been the recipient.
But particularly now that, uh,
that her father's left us.
She's, um...
diligent to a degree.
- And looks up to you.
- Yes, she really does.
Oh, darling,
I want you to do me a favor,
and if you see me nod off,
I want you to give me a nudge.
Don't you want to go to sleep?
No, I don't want to go to sleep.
Don't you want to have
a nice nap?
Oh, I don't know, it's just
yesterday, after lunch,
I dropped off and I...
it was like this kind of...
Can't really explain it.
Sort of dread.
What kind of dread?
Being here. I mean...
There's no question there are...
um... you know...
...all sorts of memories
popping up.
It's inevitable I suppose.
You know, even in this room.
So many.
What sort of memories?
Well, I mean, you know,
the longer we're here,
the... the more it comes back.
You know, the times
I've been here.
When, when I...
...came to visit... Aunt Joss.
Not just when I was a child,
but later.
What sort of memory?
You know, when I was, um...
when I, when I was, uh...
...when I was expecting
that baby.
Oh, yes.
I was here.
Oh, Mum. I had no idea.
Yeah, well, no, I mean,
you know, how could you darling?
But, uh, I mean, I...
...virtually
forgotten it myself.
But, you know, I was thinking,
you know, it was...
It was around about
this time of year.
And, um...
Yeah, I mean...
And I was in this room.
And we'd been for a walk.
Too long... I think.
Yeah. And, um...
And I started to bleed.
Oh.
I was here without Daddy,
but then...
I was taken to hospital,
and, um...
when he came there...
the thing I can't
stop thinking about
was I wasn't very nice to him.
Oh, Mum.
I mean, in the circumstances...
I was really
quite horrid, actually.
Daddy would have understood.
He would have understood.
Mum?
Mum?
- Hello?
- Hi. Your cousin's downstairs.
- Alistair.
- He's here?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Mum, Alistair's here.
Darling!
Didn't you call him back?
Oh, well, uh...
oh, that's a surprise.
Could you... could you tell him
that I'll be down in a second?
- Yeah, okay.
- Thank you very much.
What shall I do?
Oh that's awful. Well you must
go and get rid of him.
Get rid of him.
I... okay. Oh, my God!
Louis... Louis, you go down.
- Take Louis.
- Come on, come with me. Come on.
Come on.
Oh, my God, it's so awful!
Whoops! Good boy.
- Writing?
- Yeah.
- Another film?
- Yes, another film.
Another film.
So look, I've bought these.
I know it's, uh,
Rosalind's birthday.
Oh, no, you remembered.
That is so touching.
- Um, thank...
- Hope you have a lovely day.
She will be thrilled.
We're having a really
lovely celebratory day.
Good, good, good.
- Okay.
- So much love to everybody.
Love to you all.
- I certainly am and...
- Okay, darling.
All the better for seeing you
and give everybody lots of love.
- And I'll see you soon.
- Yeah.
- Louis, come here.
- Take care.
Okay, so Louis,
you're not coming with us.
Bulgy, come on. In the back.
Come on, let's go.
Say goodbye... Okay...
Take care of yourself.
Yes, good boy.
Louis, come on.
Oh!
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm fine.
I love that dress.
What's all this?
Yeah, Louis and I did it.
You are naughty.
It's too much.
Which one are you gonna
open first?
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think?
Well what about the one
on your plate.
All right. What can that be?
Such pretty paper.
You'll be seeing it again
at Christmas.
Oh, my.
Goodness me, I recognize that.
Oh, darling.
Little box.
Oh, no.
Do you like it?
Oh, that's the dearest
little thing.
It's like... it's like
the one Dad gave you.
Oh, how lovely, darling.
Thank you so much.
I'm going to put it
on my dressing table.
Next to my pill box one.
Thank you so much.
I thought it would be nice.
One from Daddy and one from me.
Okay, which one next?
I think I might spin it out,
actually, darling.
- All right.
- Save them up.
Feeling a bit puffed, actually.
Hi.
Would you like me to open
the champagne for you?
Oh, no, no. Don't worry,
I'll do it. Thank you.
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yes, thank you.
You ready for some bubbles?
Going to do it yourself?
Good girl.
I don't want to do any damage
to the beautiful ceiling.
Oh!
Oh, darling,
just a... just a little.
Just a, just the tiniest drop.
That'll do it, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Happy birthday, Mum.
To us.
Oh, I'm actually starving.
Oh, lovely. Mm!
Bubbles went up my nose.
What do you want?
Know the menu quite well by now.
Oh, yes, um...
I think I'm gonna have exactly
what I had yesterday.
I thought it was... I've been
thinking about it all day.
Yes. Let's have a look.
You know, darling,
I'm not sure that I can manage
any dinner quite yet.
-I think I'll, uh,
-Oh, Mum.
You have to have something.
Just a starter?
I'll just... I...
Just nothing, I think,
for the moment.
Well we can wait.
Yeah, we can...
Yeah, we can order later.
You... you choose
something lovely
and I'll, uh,
enjoy watching you eat it.
No, I... No I, well, I'm...
I'm... I'm not that hungry.
But you just said
you were starving.
Well, I'm not gonna sit eating
if you're not gonna
have anything.
- Well, whyever not?
- Well...
Well, maybe I'm not hungry.
You say you're not hungry.
Oh, darling, don't be so silly.
Well, I...
Well, you order
something lovely,
and, uh... and... and enjoy it.
I don't have
any hunger if you aren't hungry.
The second you tell me you're
hungry and you want some food,
I will be hungry for it.
But if you're not gonna
eat anything...
Oh, darling, wha...
Don't, just don't push me.
I... I'm not feeling very well.
Well, we can go up if you like.
We don't have to sit here.
No, don't fuss. Don't fuss.
Don't fuss.
It just makes me feel worse
when you do.
I'm not fussing.
What do you expect me to do when
you say you're not feeling well?
It's like a nightmare.
Oh darling.
Have something delicious and...
and I'll enjoy
watching you eating it.
I'm not hungry.
I'm not gonna eat if you don't.
Mum, I don't know how
this happened. Well, how did...
I just want you to be happy.
I just...
I'm trying all the time
to make you happy.
I can't keep guessing.
Can't you just tell me,
you just...
You're like a sort of
mystery person to me.
And I, I've spent
all my life doing this.
Trying to figure out how
to make you happy.
And I have a life of my own.
I have a husband
who I neglect completely,
and I don't have
that much time left.
And I don't have a family
beyond you.
I don't have any children.
And I'm not gonna have anybody
to fuss over me
when I'm your age.
Ah, fu...
Are you ready to order?
Um, we're not actually
gonna have anything.
Um, thank you very much.
Nothing at all?
No, no, no. Not, not, no...
I'll let you know when we do.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Mum, I really didn't mean
to say that.
- Yes?
- Are you ready for the cake?
Oh... Could you come
with me, please?
Could you not mention the cake
at the table?
- Um, okay.
- If you could go and collect it,
bring it here, with the candle.
I will light the candle.
- All right.
- Quick, go and get it.
Yeah, I will.
- I said I wanted to light it.
- Okay.
And I want
to carry it in like this.
Thank you. Thank you.
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, dear Mum
Happy birthday to you
Do you want me to do it?
Are you all right?
I just...
I didn't get it right.
You did everything right.
You did.
Now, get some rest.
And I'll see you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Mum...
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Are you
gonna be okay with your bags?
Yes, thank you.
- There.
- Thank you.
Um, I just wanted to say
before you go that I, uh...
I hope you're okay.
Thank you.
And I was going to say
thank you for looking after me.
Um, merry Christmas.
- Have a happy Christmas.
- You, too.
- Bye-bye.
- Good bye.
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello.
Be good. Go on.
Thank you for all your kindness.
You're most welcome.
