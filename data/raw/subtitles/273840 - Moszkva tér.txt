We used to wait for the party addresses
at the Moscow Square every Saturday night.
Those who thought themselves cool
gathered here.
That day was my 18th birthday.
I remember I wanted
a pair of cowboy boots.
The girls like that sort of things,
and I never had any girlfriend yet.
Today is 27th April, 1989.
- Happy fucking birthday!
- Thanks.
Look at me, pal!
It's a must, particularly for an adult.
- What did you get?
- A swiss watch.
- Water proof?
- No. It's my grandfather's clock.
- What does it know?
- Nothing. You have to wind it up.
Fuck that! Did they figure
this shit out for the 18th?
I start to like that damn motorcycle
what I got instead of a car.
I've got the addresses.
Orom str. 8.
They say it's sure.
- There is an another one up on the hill.
- That's awesome! I live in the neighborhood.
There is one in the Karoly Szasz str. 17.
We start on the hill
then we go down.
Why not to the Karoly Szasz street?
It's just a few minutes away from here.
Don't be fool!
All of this people want to go there.
Your mother is a fool.
- What you've got?
- Karoly Szasz street 17.
- Everyone know that.
- Then we'll go home to sleep.
MOSCOW SQUARE
Fuck! What's going on?
Out of fuel?
- Who threw out the bottle?
- You have to say "sir".
Get off!
You're a nice guy we wanted to
get off just over here anyway.
Get off!
Get the hell out off my bus!
A bus driver can't put
his hand on me!
- Get off my bus!
- Your bus? It's the people's!
Jerk.
Do you know who's the jerk?
Gas him!
You're the jerk!
Just clap your hands
but you'll cry!
- Get off!
- No one said we have to walk.
Relax, relax. You go first.
- Can I help you?
- Zoli called us.
- What Zoli?
- Zoli Kocsis.
- Are you the master of the party?
- Something like that.
Don't shit me, my brother is in there.
I have to talk to him.
Take off your shoes!
Who are they?
Hi! Do you want some chianti?
- There he is.
- My classmates.
Let's look aroud.
Don't ask! Come on!
This place is full of weirdos.
A bunch of little Sagodis.
- The garden look nice.
- We have to get rid of those smartasses.
- They're pretty slow.
- I don't understand how can they stand this.
- Do you have ligths?
- No.
Have you got some lights?
Hey!
Me?
Sure.
- Hi Kigler!
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?
- Today is his birthday.
The 18th?
That's awesome!
- There's some champagne in the kitchen.
- Thanks for the tip.
- Only two  of you?
- Yeah, two.
U2. That's cool.
Fucking Boney M!
A sip of death.
What the fuck is this?
- Published by...
- Don't read it, just put it away!
- We know this girl, don't do that!
- Don't be a moron!
- Do you watch the high mass?
- This is some kind of movie.
Have you got the Rambo?
It's nice from you.
Get out of here!
I don't take this slow motion anymore.
Stop!
Do you take us to the Gellert Hill
for a bottle of scotch, master?
Show me!
- Brand new!
- Get in!
- Orom str. 8. Above the aquifer.
- Alright, but I'll not turn on the taximeter.
Sure, but turn on the radio
or I'll tear apart the drape!
Change the station!
- Don't throw up!
- You've got your whisky don't worry!
Alright, I'm just warning you. One day
the goulash was ended up on my neck.
- I take a piss.
- Hurry up!
Six and ten? Where
the fuck is the eight?
I bet we have to go up.
Closed. Ring!
If there is no eight then we lost
a bottle of whisky. You know that?
Relax!
It must be over there.
- What you want?
- We're looking for Rajnai. Orom street 8.
No Rajnai here and there is
no Orom street 8!
What you mean no 8?
- I mean the City Hall fucked up!
- Go to sleep!
I knew you would fuck up again!
Get the hell out of here!
Don't make noise here!
This is a residential area!
It happens sometimes, doesn't it?
- What? - Nothing, it was a
fake address, that's it!
Yeah, nothing! You're a fag,
a prick and a moron at the same time!
We can't sleep because of you!
They're coming in,
those are sitting there.
I'll call the police, my son!
Cops!
- Come on!
- What?
The back stairs!
- Go back!
- Hey man, relax!
This is the best food ever.
But why they put sauerkraut in it,
I don't understand.
I like it as it is.
- Will you go in on Monday?
- I don't give a shit.
- What if they drop out?
- I don't give a shit about that either.
We don't want to go to college, do we?
- You walk?
- Yeah.
I'll catch a cab.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- 'Morning.
- Hi.
- How was it?
- Rough.
- What does it mean?
- Leave me alone!
- Do you want some coffee?
- No.
- Where were you been?
- Partying.
- You drank something?
- Just a little champaigne.
I want to sleep.
- What do you want for lunch?
- I don't care.
You care about nothing.
You have to wind this up once in a while.
You should learn it.
There was a lot of people everywhere.
The queue reached the boulevard.
It was an awesome feeling.
- There were no cops?
- Yeah, sure, with a minivan at the bridge.
- Was it as so rough as on 15th?
- No, it wasn't.
- Did you make that trouble?
- What trouble?
You smashed up the bathroom
and a lot of thing disappeared.
Leave me alone!
- I'm sure it wasn't them!
- I'm sure they were!
You came with Kigler only?
Didn't you?
We met at the terrace, didn't we?
Who were that other two guys?
- I don't know, leave me alone!
- I saw that four of you came in!
Don't fuck with me,
you fucking asshole!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I'm happy to see the thirst for knowledge
and the fresh faces.
I'm reporting to you sir: the Sun is shining,
one more week to go 'till summer holiday,
I'm feeling fine,
I'm mentally balanced,
and no one is missing.
I'm unbelievably happy.
- Kigler is missing.
- As usual.
- Petya?!
- Yeah?
- Do you know something about Kigler?
- He's ill, probably.
I've got a good and a bad news.
Which one you want to hear first?
The good one!
There was a decision
up in the Ministry,
- a decision that will affect
the high-school graduation -
in consideration of the
political situation
the test questions
of history after 1945
will not be the part of the
graduation exam.
That's a happiness for
everybody, for you
because you have to learn
four test themes less,
and for me because,
the content of this book
is incredibly accurate,
but I can't say it's 100% true.
Hooray!
Oh, my son, Kigler. I apologize you
to start the lesson without you.
No problem, sir.
You missed the good news,
now the bad one.
Mrs. Juhasz send you this message:
if you won't show up her lesson,
she'll not let you to take part
in the graduation exam.
Thank you, sir,
for this useful information.
Welcome, my son.
Happy new year!
They were this close to catch me.
The cops show up and everyone
was pushed back to the apartment.
Royal tried to defend
the owner of the house,
but then he was arrested.
- How do you know that?
- I talked with my friend on the phone.
- So, then they let them out?
- Sure. They were in for two or three hours.
Royal kicked a cop in the stomach.
I'm serious.
What are you laughing at?
After that they spray gas
on them and that's it.
- Do Csomor get busted?
- He? He's the king of steal.
Don't smoke here, because
it's going on my nerves.
- Why don't you say hello, you nerd?
- I said it. Get off your feet.
- Who heard that, huh?
- Your mother.
What did you say you
fucking communist?
I'm not communist you
newly-rich jerk!
Kigler, come to the blackboard!
Write up the #4084 example.
Teacher, we already solved that!
Write it up, he wasn't here anyway.
"17 boys go to a two-day trip."
Where are the girls?
Forget it now.
"There is one 8 bed,"
"one 4 bed,"
Carry on!
"one 3 bed and one 2 bed rooms in
the tourist house."
Enough!
- We didn't do anything!
- Leave the classroom, both of you!
- But madam!
- Don't you understand?
Hurry up!
Let's go Kigler!
- "How can we...?"
- Write it up!
- It's a pretty simple task.
- Then go on!
17 boys
we add the three rooms
to it...
It was absolutely unfair, wasn't it?
I don't want to see more
exercise book!
Hi, wait a minute, please!
- Did you decorated the bathroom?
- Me? Are you fool?
It was Petya, he can do such things.
- He overreacted a bit.
- Don't fall for it!
It was probably that two unknown guys!
- Four of you came in at the same time!
- No! They were just two of them, remember?
I know that you did it
and I think it's a big rudeness!
Hi, Petya!
- Check this out!
- Whose car is this?
It's mine, of course!
Just get it now.
A fucking Porsche?
Get in!
Thanks for your help, buddy!
We're going up to relax a little.
Bye!
- What's up? Don't you like porn?
- Sure, I like it, but this is more interesting.
- Come on!
- Then watch it!
Why do you have to get
peeved now?
Hello... Juditka!
No, no! Don't help me... Krisztike!
Hey, this is my favourite casette!
Where was it?
Gabor put it in, but now
they are upstairs.
No problem!
Have fun!
- Whisky?
- No, thank you.
- Graduation?
- We didn't even have the prom, yet.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Everything's OK?
- Yes.
- Math?
- It's OK.
PT?
I have to go,
I must learn a lot.
Don't rush!
Where are you going?
Stay!
Don't you feel yourself fine?
Yes. Bye!
Then go, fuck you!
- Hello, uncle Jancsi!
- Hi.
- Who was this chick?
- Classmate.
- Did you fuck her?
- No, she didn't let me.
She is nice, don't miss this opportunity!
- Your grandma?
- She's OK.
Gabor is at home!
- He successfully passed math.
- Heard that.
The Porsche is superb!
What Prosche?
This is my most expensive car, fuck you!
How could you do such a stupid thing?
He said you know about it.
Pick up the phone and ask me!
I should fire you for this, fuck you!
Oh, come on boss!
He's your son!
Do you really think, that my asshole kid
can ride my best car?
- It's not his fault!
- Shut the fuck up!
Get off that car!
If you gave me your own car,
I wouldn't have to do this.
What have I got for my 18th birthday, huh?
Not even a bicycle!
OK, just forget it!
And I drank water like the flowers!
Shut up!
Boss, something happened?
I'll fucking kill you!
- Uncle Jancsi!
- What?
- May I get in?
- Yeah!
- How much is that Zhiguli?
- The red one?
Fifty grand.
Beautiful car, fifty is nothing for it!
Fourty-five just for you, huh?
It was a cab but still in top shape!
Fourty is my last offer!
Just because of your grandma!
Try it fool!
Pedal to the metal!
- Do you like it, huh?
- Tasty!
- Just like your father.
- They doesn't look alike.
Don't tell me that!
He grew up next to me.
- Can I have more potatoe?
- Gobble up!
- We found a cheap Zhiguli.
- What for?
We can be a cab drivers.
What?
On our own.
There's a lot of money in it.
- But those self-employed...
- What's up with them?
You cannot be serious!
You want me to have
a decent job.
- Stop playing with me!
- Why, what else was your idea?
I thought you go to the college.
What is it good for?
- I thought...
- Thought what?
You cannot be a cab driver!
Then, what else?
- You said some sort of engineer.
- It was a long time ago.
- You won that drawing contest!
- Sure, the drawing contest.
- Where are you going?
- To us, watching video.
- At this time?
- Why? No school tomorrow.
How?
Comerade! Did you forget that
tomorrow is the 1st of May?
My God!
Give me a cigarette!
We buy the cheapest
international train ticket,
erase it, and
then we photocopy it.
- Got it?
- Not really.
Don't be so dumb!
We need a colour copier.
My father will fix that at his company.
We need someone to
fill it nicely.
Petya will do that.
Alright.
He's an artist.
If this works, then we'll have loads of money.
Drink!
- Now what? Going home?
- May 1st tomorrow. Swimming pools are going to open!
- They fill up the pools today.
- I love you Csomor.
- What's up Picasso? Are you tired?
- Look!
What's up, angel? Moscow Square?
I'm waiting somebody.
- Me?
- Sure.
- Hello.
- Are you waiting for the smartass?
Leave me alone!
And you? Just hanging out?
We're going to the Gellert Bath
to swim. Come with us!
- I don't have any swimsuit with me.
- Neither do we.
Come on pussies!
Here comes the tram!
Where are you going?
To the Russian Embassy.
- You know it.
- Come on, fuck you!
- What kind of undershorts have you got?
- Look at Petya's, fuck you!
- It's cold!
Don't bring your watch with you!
You stay out, you don't have
a bathing-cap on!
What are you doing here?
Get the hell out of here!
- Let us swim a little!
- What?
Don't you wanna earn some
extra money, master?
- How much do you think?
- 500.
For 800 i'll give you some waves too.
- We have 500 only, master.
- Then go home.
- How much have you got?
- It's in my trousers, take it!
I'll be right back, master.
If this works, I'll buy that Porsche
from my father.
I want to see as you tell him.
I'm going to buy a land rover.
With chromed rims!
We'll cover the Moscow Square
with carpet.
We'll be able go anywhere,
to Amsterdam, or whatever!
Sure, but then we'll go to
the Lake Balaton and I'll buy the Sio Tour.
What are you doing in the
middle of the bridge?
Having a breakfast, officer.
- In the middle of the bridge?
- Why, is it forbidden?
IDs.
Hurry up, boys!
Where are these chairs from?
One of our friend are moving in a new place
but we didn't have enough place for these things.
We're helping to bring them across.
Students, they're alright.
- And where did you get those crecent rolls?
- At a 24/7 shop.
And I have to believe that.
I'm serious. Are you hungry?
Do you want a piece?
Man can stay hungry in this
fucking city.
There nothing to eat all
night long.
- Where is that 24/7 shop?
- First or second street.
- Meszoly street?
- I don't know.
One or two blocks away.
- Do you know where it is?
- Yeah, I know.
Wish you the best!
Hooray for May 1st!
Hooray for May 1st!
Sorry.
Wait!
I'll kick your ass!
Stand here!
Give that flower to him
with your right hand!
I can control it, leave me!
Now!
You would have been shaved!
- Hello, Boci mama!
- Hello.
Hello, Boci mama,
we'll talk later!
- Recording, OK?
- Better not!
Thanks.
- Did you see David?
- No.
Go to the school yard,
I'll meet you there.
- How long is this going on?
- I don't know.
Dear Parents!
Family members, friends!
Dear graduating students!
Keep quiet just for two more minutes!
It's a new period in our lives.
You'll be adults.
You start to live the real life,
and there is a long and
rough road ahead of you.
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not.
Your boyfriend didn't show up?
Leave me alone!
Knowledge, solid faith,
building materials...
Building materials, sure!
Congratulations!
Bricks or mortar?
And after long years, when
the youth passes away...
Stop!
...will gild your old years.
Gild your ass, you cow!
I wish all of you good luck
and happiness.
Girls, boys! Good bye!
- Finally!
- It was awful for me, too!
- David was not here really?
- We didn't see him.
Leave me alone with David!
- You became so tall!
- Thank you!
I prepared your grandma!
Congratulations anyway.
Thank you.
The principal talked
beautifully.
- I'm happy you like that.
- So, what is this?
- Hello, Boci mama.
Hello, son.
So, what is this?
Porshe key!
- You got the Porshe?
- Come on!
I'll be back later!
Cool car, huh?
Who is this moron?
Pull over!
- What's up?
- We've got the test questions!
Relax, you know this is a must!
We'll go up to eat soon.
There'll be booze too.
Why is this a must?
We wait 'till the others finish the
singing, and then we'll go upstairs.
Come up, don't make me ridiculous!
Come up!
I thought you won't come.
Good evening!
Good evening, sir!
Hello, take a seat!
Read this, sir!
Lajos Nagy: January, Attila Jozsef...
What is this?
- These are the graduation test questions.
- Allegedly these are the real ones.
No!
It's sure, my father got it.
- Who are you?
- Zsolt Kiraly.
Istvan Szechenyi High School, sport class.
Strength and health, sir!
Allegedly his father got
these from the highest level.
- You shit me?
- No.
My best friend.
Trust me,
I'm trusting you, sir!
Sir! Who the hell is Lajos Nagy?
You have to understand that it's not a
problem if someone get an A grade...
What if we make this public?
Everybody will find out that
there is chaos and corruption.
- What do you want to make public?
- Everything, what happens here.
- What? Can you tell us?
- Sure I can tell you...
- We cannot prove it.
- And what can we do?
For example we
make it to the end.
And after that we put it in front of
their face and say "we could make it".
To tell them in this way that
somebody leaked this information?
For example.
- Something wrong?
- No, I'm just bored.
Yeah.
They camp it up a bit.
You never saw such a
beautiful bathroom!
And the college preliminary exam
test questions are in my trousers.
- So, did he call you?
- He's a moron.
He's an arrogant egoist jerk.
- It was written on his face.
- Thanks.
Do not use illegal tools, please!
Otherwise I have to
suspend that person.
Please, everyone be fair, kids.
First theme:
The literary examination of
the novell Lajos Nagy: January.
I write it on the blackboard in case
somebody cannot memorize it.
Lajos Nagy: January.
- Thank you, madam.
- Where are you going?
Home. What do you think?
I'm ready.
- Such a short time?
- Sure.
Bye, I'm late!
Did you see her face when I
stood up after half hour?
I thought she'll start to cry.
I filled up nine pages.
She sneezed on my pen again.
And she touched my back with
that hand?
Thanks, we find our way in.
Did you feel that smell?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Tell me, how is it going?
- Two beers please!
- I pay!
Psht! News!
It's eleven o'clock
and now the news.
The high-school graduation examinations
has been started today.
It's been suspected that in several
high-schools the students
knew the literature exam
questions in advance.
There is a meeting in the Ministry
related to this issue.
- I can't believe it!
- Fuck, I knew it!
If you tell them you didn't know about it
they can't prove the opposite!
- What if they repeat the test?
- They can do it.
- The teacher tell them?
- Don't talk crap, Csomor!
I'm going home
to talk to my father.
You better pray!
- Go to your daddy!
- And what will happen now?
I think they gonna screw us.
Give me that phone!
Thank you.
- We learned a lot, you know that!
- OK, OK!
Good afternoon, I'm looking for
Mrs. Banki at the education department.
If they force the students to rewrite
that test, they'll disgrace them!
Hello Marika, it's Eva.
I'm calling you because Petya just
has done the graduation exam today,
and no offense, but I don't
understand what's going on!
What's going on over there?
Tell her that we didn't know the
questions for sure!
They did not know!
They learn well!
Do you have to sing?
Give it back!
Jozsef Szilagyi will be buried
in the 302th parcel.
What is this? Combine harvester?
Have you never seen a road roller?
At the suit of his daughter's wish,
Imre Nagy will be buried in 301st parcel.
- Who the hell is Imre Nagy?
- He's the brother of Lajos Nagy for sure!
Are you really such assholes?
Quiet!
There was a huge surprise
in several high-schools.
At 10 o'clock a lot of students
leaving after a succesful written test.
The suspicion was not fictitious.
In the Ministry,
it was handled as a fact
that the test questions
were leaked.
- How many school was affected by this
scandal? - We don't know exactly.
We were notified via phone
so we ask the informants
to make their statement
in written form also.
Shut up!
Written statements arrived
from eight high-schools.
We decided on the meeting that
the result of the exam is invalid.
We'll take the year-end grades
as the final result.
Thanks to my father!
- It's much easier with a blade, isn't it?
- Shut up!
- How much this train ticket cost?
- Two hundred or so.
- We should sell it for three thousand.
- Two thousand for friends.
No friends, it's business.
- Is it yours?
- Put it back!
Relax!
Petya, tell me why are you
living with your grandma?
Don't be a moron
leave him alone!
Why? I don't know nothing.
His father defected.
His mother is dead.
Sorry, I didn't know that.
- And where is your father now?
- I don't know and I don't care!
Change the subject!
- Royal, have you ever been in West?
- In London when I was young.
I remember that I've got
a bunch of toy cars.
Let's get out of here!
- We're leaving! Bye!
- Stay if you want to!
Here is some fresh cake.
Eat it!
- Bye Boci mama!
- When will you be back?
Is this the profit of the day?
It's fucking ridicilous!
- Can I help you?
- I'm looking for someone.
I think the lady is looking for
the travel agency.
- Actually... yes.
- It's in that corner.
- Hello.
- Hello, how can we help you?
- I need a train ticket.
- A train ticket?
- To Rome.
- To Rome?
You go out and the Travel Agency
is over there at the other side of the road.
Oh, come on!
How much?
Can we help her?
Give me three thousand.
- Will you fill it?
- No.
There's a guy at the stairs.
He'll fill it for you.
- Do you handle the tickets?
- Yeah.
- Where to?
- To Rome. In a sleeping car if possible.
To Berlin, but I want to spend
a few days in Prague.
Barcelona.
To Athens, but not thru Romania!
London.
To Palermo via Rome.
I want to go to Paris.
- How do you know we're doing this?
- Everybody know it!
- Don't talk about it in the school, OK?
- I'll not compromise my ticket.
- Simply thru Vienna?
- Yeah.
- Bunch of people are going to Paris.
- Yeah, there'll be a great party.
- It's the 200th anniversary of the
revolution. - What revolution?
You're really good at history!
You'll fail next week.
- Leave me with that!
- OK.
Keep your eyes open.
We go upstairs.
- Do you go by yourself?
- Yeah, to my relatives.
It's easy like that.
- Do you drink something?
- No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- At least give me three thousand!
- What's wrong? We have a joint business!
Joint business? What are you
doing with the money?
Me? Paying for the place, the booze,
the cigerettes, what else do you want?
Shut up!
I can't concentrate!
I'm fighting for your money too!
Don't you see?
We just want to play.
That's what I'm talking about!
And you're bullshiting here!
- Do you want me to hit you?
- Hit me!
You can't live your life
that's your problem!
Ferike! Four scotch and
a pack of Marlboro!
The six coffins
make discipline.
After a short argument they agreed
that the Young Democrats will be the first...
Petya!
- Got some food?
- In the fridge.
The names of the accredited
photoreporters and journalists
fill so many pages.
They're standing in long lines
with flowers in their hand.
First, the citizens of the
hometown of Imre Nagy
lay the wreathes.
Then the MPs and the members
of the City Hall...
- Who are they?
- I'll tell you later.
No hot meal today?
Here's some money.
Go to the restaurant!
Petya, bring me
a bottle of beer, please!
The one-time classmates
lay down their flowers.
Life stops at half past twelve
and church bells ring
throughout the country.
- Hi. - You promised some
notes for the exam.
- Sure, so?
- Will you bring out?
Come in, nobody's at home.
What kind of notes do you want?
Hello.
Hi.
We're learning.
Go in!
- What you need exactly?
- History mostly.
OK, just a second.
We were at the Heroes' Square
then I came up. He helps me in math.
We'll finish soon.
- And how was it?
- What?
- Heroes' Square.
- That was good. There was a lot of people.
This Sagodi have got a
bunch of great stuff.
- Don't touch it!
- I didn't know it's so important.
It's not so important
just don't touch it.
- Hello.
- Wich busline do you take?
- 86.
- I'm coming with you.
- Don't go!
- I have to or I'll miss the last bus.
- Don't do this!
- Hello.
- No Hello.
- Thanks for your help!
- When will you leave?
- After prom. On the next day.
You told me you'll go only
in the middle of July.
Things changed a little.
It seems I won't do the college
entering exam.
How come?
I managed to get in
to the Sorbonne.
- Where?
- The Sorbonne.
- What's that?
- Petya, come on!
It's like ELTE
just it's in Paris.
- So you leave?
- Would you stay in my place?
I don't know.
- Come over here!
- But teacher!
Pick a new one!
- She's a little bit nervous. It happens.
- Sure.
- Jutka have to pick a new one!
- Really?
Poor girl. Maybe she
needed to learn more.
You're a rude jerk!
Number 16.
World War II.
The beginning, the results, the middle?
- She's nervous!
- Sure.
Come on Sagodi!
You're next!
Go on!
- So, the ancient greeks.
- The ancient greeks.
- May I start?
- Yes.
In the 5th century B.C.
there were bigger
social changes in Athens
than in the other countries.
The main cause of this
difference was
the faster development...
Kigler!
Come in!
It's the second from the right.
- He picked the prehistoric communities!
- Lucky bastard!
- Are you nervous?
- A little.
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.
It's like a pyramide.
If you look in it
you'll pick Egypt.
Sure.
- Do you really like it? - I can't
give you better grade than A.
Sorry, sir.
The point is that you have to
think about it like a game.
Like a quiz show.
If you think about it like that
then it's a smooth ride.
The ancient Egypt.
That's the point, got it?
- Do you really understand?
- Yeah.
I passed.
C.
I picked the French Revolution.
I'll stay here with the others
for a while.
I'll help you to learn
in summer.
Me too.
You succeded math!
- Do you like my eyes?
- Yeah. It's like a molded croissant.
Drink a beer and forget it!
Don't give beer to her,
she is not a graduated adult!
Leave her alone!
The one who fails shall not drink!
Don't be so mad at me!
You're a jerk, Kigler!
I won't hit you because
it's against my principles.
- Let's drink to your principles then!
- Drink this one too!
Do a joke worth everything for you?
Don't go now! We can't
drink six beers!
Of course we can!
Check this out!
See you later!
You're a fucking moron!
Why?
Do you like it?
How did you know that?
I guessed it.
Don't you happy?
Of course I'm happy.
Did you call Kigler's dad?
- Stucked!
- Give it to me!
- A top notch Soviet car.
- Get in!
Slow down!
- Did you drink?
- No I didn't!
Alright.
- Where can I take the lady?
- The lady?
The old chick!
This is Petya's car! Let's
fucking push it into the Danube!
Forget it! My dad got it for him.
Cool, isn't it?
Yeah. But not for me.
- Are we really want to go in?
- Sure!
You can't come in,
do you know that?
Come on! You don't let me
in to my own prom?
You may come in, but
not the others.
This is your gratitude for
the test questions you nerd?
This is a private party.
Then he's my mother and
he's my father. Alright?
You told me we can
bring our parents with us.
- Don't you feel cold, honey?
- Leave that kid alone!
- When will you get there?
- In about a day.
- Good evening, sir!
- Good evening.
It's bigger on bigger ships.
I wanted to tell you so much more.
What?
Hey I'm fucking looking for ya!
I heard you got the new car!
- I look around inside.
- OK.
You can thank to my father,
you know that.
Thought so.
Royal is here.
Drink!
What's up guys?
Just dry like that?
You're a prick, my son!
You have to go to her,
that's the solution.
I don't like that kind of music.
Me neither, but it doesn't matter.
- Sagodi!
- Yes, sir!
Leave us alone!
The last time you told me that
thing about the civil democracy
was very interesting.
Me and my dad often talk
about it at home.
- Give my kind regards
to your father. - I will.
- Think about Egypt sometimes!
- I will.
- You're not even humans!
- That's it, you have to fix it!
I finally got rid of it but now
you bring it back like this?
I'll suck with it for months!
Your dad will mutilate me!
What months? You have to be
ready with it 'till next week!
- It'll be expensive.
- How much?
Fifty grand at least.
- You'll get it, don't worry!
- Maybe more.
It can't be more!
We sold it for fourty!
I'll show it to Sanyi
he'll check it.
- Today! - Sure. Do you
want me to give blood too?
- I give you five grand, OK?
- Alright.
- How much have you got?
- A grand.
I give you two now
and another three tomorrow.
Keep your mouth shut
in front of you dad!
Don't talk to me like that, fuck you
or you'll be fucking fired!
Got it?
That's it. We quit!
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.
- You need it for that shitty car, huh?
- Yeah, I need a hundred grand.
- And you?
- I don't want to get busted.
- Are you a coward fag?
- Don't fucking play with us!
We worked hard
for that money.
- How much is their part?
- Fourty grand each.
- Do I give 'em?
- Fuck that.
We show you the big business but
you let me down 'cause of a car?
Just do it!
Have a nice summer!
- Where are you going?
- To the Lake Balaton.
The train is going there.
You don't have to go by car.
We don't.
Hey. Where is your car?
At Kigler's garage.
- They let me to leave there.
- It's nice from them.
- We're going to them.
- Do they have a weekend house too?
They bought it this spring.
- Do they have a phone there?
- No. I'll call you from a phonebooth.
- Do you have money?
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute!
- Hurry up!
- Here is 500 Ft.
- Thanks.
Watch yourself!
No problem.
- Hello.
- I'm looking for you.
- Do you need your notes?
- No.
I have to go
or I'll miss my train.
- Where are you going?
- To the Lake Balaton.
Look, I awfully
need a train ticket.
It's impossible. We quit.
- But you were doing it last week!
- A lot of people got busted we had to quit.
- Can you get one for me somehow?
- Where do you want to go?
- To Paris.
- Zsofi called you?
No. Her parents gave me her number.
It's impossíble, I'm sorry.
Here is the bus!
- I'm sure you've got one somewhere!
- No!
- Look for Royal. We quit.
- I don't know them!
Then someone else.
I succesfully got in the college.
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
They take me to the Army!
Esti Hirlap!
Awesome news!
Special edition!
- Where is my passport?
- You'll look for it on the train!
Janos Kadar is dead!
- Is this the train to Vienna?
- Yes. Get up!
Thanks chief!
That was close.
- We don't have the tickets.
- You didn't fill them out, you fool?
I didn't know the destination.
- Check out where is he!
- He's at the end of the car, hurry up!
- Destination? Amsterdam?
- As we agreed.
- He's almost here! Three boxes away!
- Calm down.
He's over here, put it away!
Done.
- Good day!
- Good day!
- Is it you?
- Yes.
That was a nice jump. Luck.
- Where are you going? Amrestad?
- Amsterdam, yeah.
They sit on their asses
in that office all day long
but they can't fill out
a ticket nicely.
You have to transfer at Vienna.
That's a two hours long waiting.
- Have a nice trip!
- Thanks! Bye!
If the first one sucks it
the others won't check it.
Look at that!
I'm going insane!
- They watch us.
- Over ther too. I wet my pants.
Wilkommen in Wien.
Two Stunde is ten Shilling.
Here it is.
Hold it.
- Stealing coat, come here!
- Come on!
I never come to Vienna without it.
This will open up in two hours
then anyone can pinch our stuff.
We'll be here, relax!
Don't stop everywhere.
Is this the West?
- You never have been in Vienna?
- No. So what?
Then we go to Maria Hilfer obviously!
- What are you doing you fool?
- I begged you not to do it!
You can transport it
top-side-up only!
- Hello, good appetite!
- Thank you honey.
- What are you talking yout?
- It'll break down, you idiot!
- But the backpack is full of food!
- I don't care I'm going in.
- We'll miss the train!
- We won't.
Check this out!
I took everything.
You're nuts! Let's move
away from here!
- Nobody's watching. I'm going back.
- No, you don't!
- I do!
- We'll miss the train!
There are loads of cassetes
and stuff!
Yes, I'm saying.
319-427. Janos Kigler.
Yes, I'm holding.
Hello uncle Jancsi.
I'm Petya.
Actually we're here in Vienna...
Yes, in Vienna.
Gabi is with me. I mean he's
not here now because
we had some trouble.
We were in a store and
he stole some stuff and
he was arrested by the police.
You have to come here because
I can't bring him out. He'll
stay in custody anyway.
I'm telling you the address:
Sperrgasse 17.
Two R, two S.
Sperrgasse, yes.
His packs are at
the Lost and Found.
I got to go now.
I can't stay.
Yes, I know we're stupid and stuff.
I'll tell you everything.
Thank you. Bye.
Hello.
- Do you speak Hungarian?
- Yes.
- I've got this address and...
- Are you looking for Zsofi?
Yes.
She'll be back in a minute.
She's in the laundry.
- Is it far from here?
- No. Next street.
Come in 'till then!
- What's wrong?
- I'm going to find her. Bye!
- You'll miss each other!
- I'll find her!
At least leave your backpack here!
Thank you!
Super.
She's at her boyfriend.
- Looks cool.
- Yeah.
- Wine?
- No.
Look, we were there tonight.
I'm sure Alain Delon
should have a cigarette now,
but I tried to call my grandma.
I was a prick, obviously.
My theacher was right.
I didn't understand why she not
answer that fucking phone?
She always wake up
for every noise.
What if Kigler's dad had called her
and she found out
that we're not at the Lake Balaton?
I thought she probably went to swim.
Poor grandma
never foud out
that I crashed that
shitty Zhiguli.
One day she dropped down dead
at the market.
I felt bad when Kigler didn't
show up at the funeral.
That bastard ate a
huge amount of chicken!
I heard he became a hot-shot.
He's runnig some sort of
car rental business.
Csomor told me that.
I meet him frequently.
He's got a pub few blocks away.
Pretty good place.
He adds water to the beer
but it's cheap at least.
They had some trouble
with Royal three years ago.
He refuses to tell me
what happened exactly.
I know that they have to
take out one of Royal's kidney.
The Serbs kicked his ass so hard
that the doctors was
hardly able to patch him up.
Allegedly he's alright now.
He's currently not on drugs and
have a girlfriend. What else he need?
Dr. Sagodi successfully
finished the college
the he went to the US.
I heard he came back last year
but he didn't like the atmosphere
and went back to Oregon to
work as an assistant lecturer.
Zsofi dated some sort of
40 years old anthropologist
during the college years.
Allegedly he married her but
something must went wrong
because she's here
again nowadays.
I saw her a few times in the TV.
I didn't reconize her because
her hair is blond now.
She looks pretty scary.
She's having a nice life working as a
PR manager or something like that.
What about me? Nothing.
Actually I'm fucking hungry.
I'm gonna eat a mad cow burger
with some fries in Mickey D.
It may eat my brains but
at least no sauerkraut in it.
