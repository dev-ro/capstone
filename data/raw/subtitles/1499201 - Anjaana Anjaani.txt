I'll take that. 
Hello. Ya. Will do. 
AG corporation at 11.8 
Okay, sure. 
I will call you back. 
Akash. 
Akash. 
There was a call from the bank. Our loan has been sanctioned. 
Yes, we're buying Ellen Steel company. - What? 
Why? 
It's a small loan, for around 1-1.5 million dollars. 
Ellen Steel is a dead company. 
We'll make our clients invest their money in it. 
Which will increase its stock value? 
And if the stock value increases.. 
..so will the profit. - No, no, that's not our job. 
Taking loans is not what we do.. Akash? 
Chill Dude 
Sir, can you spare me some change. 
"Is the season to be jolly.." 
'I am not responsible for this crash Mr. Lee' 
'Sir, please don't raise your voice on me.' 
'What happened when you made 150% profit last year? ' 
'Fine, I don't need you to do business.' 
'I will survive this.' 
'Akash.' 
'The market has crashed.' 
'It's over man. It just moved too fast.' 
'There was a call from the bank.' 
'Yeah, we'll payback their loan.' 
'They aren't going to lose their money.' 
'Why did you do this? ' 
'Listen, all of you knew that I was taking a loan.' 
'That's a Lie.' 
'You took our signatures for the loan.. 
..telling us that it was for 1 million dollars.' 
'And went ahead and took a loan of 12 million.' 
'What, 12 million? ' 
'Yes.. if that company had done well 
'I wasn't going to be the only one to profit from it' 
'We're all equal partners.' 
'Would you guys have agreed.. 
..if I had said it was a loan of 12 million? ' 
'All of you.. ' 
'All of you think small.' 
You think, it was easy to make this big office? 
'I didn't know the market would crash.' 
So, you cheated us. 
'You were in a hurry to make it big, isn't it? ' 
'You wanted to win every race.' 
We don't want to come first. 
Our dreams aren't as big as yours 
'What do you'll want to do? ' 
'Shut down the company.' 
'Sell the office! - Akash, please.' 
'Try to understand. - not there' 
'All of you were losers.' 
'All of you were losers! - Akash, please' 
'Go on.. let me see what you'll are capable of without me.' 
'Where will we go? ' 
'How will we repay the loan? ' 
Tell me how will we pay it back? - Gaurav. 
Where will we go and how will we repay it? - Gaurav, please. 
How will we repay the loan now, tell me 
How? 
What will we do without you? 
Your mom and dad live without you as well. 
You could neither be a good son, nor a good friend. 
What did you earn? 
Money. 
Now you don't even have that. 
Forget it. 
Forget it. 
We're losers. 
Yes. 
But today.. you're the loser. 
And the suicide rate has risen to 27.. 
A 48 year old man committed suicide today.. 
..by jumping off his office building. 
It seems he was everything. 
I am not responsible for this crash. 
Market, there's crash. 
How did I know that the market would crash? 
Die. 
Should I push you? 
What else? 
You've been standing there for so long. 
Actually no. Because that will amount to murder. 
No, no, I don't think so. 
Please continue, jump jump. 
You know.. when you want to do something like this.. 
..you shouldn't think. 
Just do it. 
Are you a suicide consultant? 
Its common sense, man. 
When I am slightly drunk.. I talk a lot. 
Jabber jabber jabber jabber 
Actually, in real life I am very quiet. 
Like really quiet. 
But wait.. this is real life. 
Sorry. I am sorry. 
Concentrate. 
Quiet. 
Continue, jump jump 
You know.. when I was really young. 
Really young. 
I never liked drinking medicine. 
My mother would say to me "Close your eyes.." 
"..count to three and drink it". 
Just.. 
So try that. 
Okay, so I am also done. 
Boy. 
One. 
Two. 
Three. 
Get off the bridge now! 
Oh no! Coast guard. 
Oh no. 
God! 
Alright, break it up you two, get off the bridge, the party is over. 
Get off the bridge now. Come on. 
'I'll elope with you on this.' 
'I am at the Hilton and the room number.. ' 
'Last night I did the same thing..' 
I found out about your accident. 
I've come alone 
No one else was ready to see you. 
Then why are you here? 
The loan you.. 
The loan we took, has been sorted out with the bank 
We are dissolving the company's assets. 
We've also found a buyer for the office. 
And we'll repay the rest by selling our personal belongings. 
The bank has summoned us on the 30th. 
Everyone. 
Since you are the guarantor.. 
..it is important for you to be there, Akash. 
Akash, I know that the bank has seized your house. 
But even after what has happened.. 
..you can still live with us. 
For as long as you want. 
Really. 
Please. 
Be there on the 30th. 
For once, Do something for others. 
What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? 
Oh God. 
Why are you following me? 
I can't help it, you're so attractive you know 
What happened to you? 
I tried to jump from the bridge after you and the police left.. 
..and fell down. 
And that's all that happened to you? 
I fell on the bridge not from the bridge. I was so drunk. 
Did you really want to die? - No, I was sightseeing. 
What happened to you? 
I tried again as well. 
Jumped in front of a car. 
And you failed as well. 
So.. are you going to try again? 
Hmm.. You too? 
What are you doing? Just.. 
They'll think that we're escaping.. 
..from the mental asylum in these clothes. 
One more thing. 
I've no interest in you. 
Zilch. 
Get that straight. 
I don't know if I should be relieved.. 
..or then begin to wonder why you aren't interested in me? 
Not that I want you to be interested in me. 
If you know what I mean? 
What am I doing with you? 
Hey. 
These scrubs look so funny from the back, isn't it? 
Whatever. 
I am Kiara. - Akash. 
So.. what is your plan? - Listen, please leave me alone. 
You know, you are very rude 
But, I am still asking you. 
Can we do this together? 
This isn't a game of double tennis that we can do together 
I'm just saying that because.. 
..I want to make sure it happens. 
I've been very dependant in life. 
I've always needed.. a push. 
So please. 
Well.. it's strange, but.. fine. 
How do you want to do it? 
We can go to my house. - What? 
I am not inviting you for coffee. 
Whatever. 
We can go to your house as well. 
I don't have a house. 
Stop. Stop. Stop. Here. 
Come on. - This way? 
I never have my house keys. 
After you. - Oh no. 
You're very smart. I know why you want to climb up after me. 
Come on, I am cold. - Oh please. 
Okay. 
Can you push me a little bit? - With pleasure. 
Lights on. Music on. 
What the hell. 
I hate this song. 
Excuse me. 
What are you doing? 
Making place to sit. 
No need to get.. too comfortable. 
You're not here to stay. 
Let's do what we have to. - What? 
I know, I know. 
We've ropes. 
We can hang ourselves. 
These sprinklers won't be able to take your weight. 
You know you're.. - Do you have plastic wrap? 
What will we do with plastic wrap? - Do you have it? 
Okay. Here. 
Asphyxiation. - As.. What? 
Suffocation. 
It's very effective. 
You, first take this and wrap it tightly around my face. 
Then I'll wrap it around your's. 
Then, when the oxygen stops reaching our brains, in a few minutes.. 
..it will stop working. 
Let's start. - Ya. 
Okay. 
Your face is too long. 
Can you breathe? 
No? 
Okay. 
Alright. 
Now my turn. 
Come on. 
Alright. 
Start already! 
Oh my, God. You cheat. 
You knew it.. you knew that you wouldn't be able to help me. 
I won't let you die. 
You will die and I will be the murderer. 
Is it my fault? 
You blindfolded my eyes, how could I see? 
Couldn't you tell me before? 
If you had died, I would've been jailed. 
This is so not going to work. 
Oh my, God. 
I have an idea. 
There are just three left. 
Okay. 
May I? - Okay. 
Paper. - Paper. 
Paper. - Paper, quickly. 
Paper. Paper. Paper. - Quickly Kiara. 
More paper? I'll get it. 
More paper. More paper. More paper. More paper. - More paper. 
Is the gas on? Is the gas on? 
The gas is on. 
Kiara. - Yes. 
When did you last pay your bill? - Which bill? 
Your gas bill. 
Your gas connection has been cut off for the past 2 months 
I have never cooked. 
How was I supposed to know? 
Look, I don't know if you think this is a joke.. 
But for me, it isn't 
If you got hold of me 
..just to get rid of your loneliness, then go pick someone else up. 
Go to any bar, I'm sure you'll find someone there. 
But just leave me alone. 
Look, I am.. 
I am sorry. 
I think I know why this is happening. 
Last night we met on the bridge. 
Both of us. 
But the coast guard arrived. 
We then tried separately, but failed. 
Then we met in the hospital. 
Strangely again.. we decided to commit suicide together. 
We came home. Tried twice. 
But failed again. 
So many attempts in one day, but all failed. 
Why? 
Do you believe in signs? 
What rubbish is this? 
It's just that you don't want to die. 
I have tried just as hard as you have, Akash. 
Maybe you or me have something left to do in life? 
'The bank has called us on the 30th.' 
'For the first time.. do something for others.' 
Okay fine. 
Then explain to me why we are still alive. 
'Since you are the guarantor..' 
'.. it is very important for you to be there, Akash.' 
Its rubbish. 
Its nonsense, I don't believe in all this. 
Maybe.. maybe you're right. 
Let's try again. 
Let's try your idea. 
And this time we'll be careful. 
I am telling you, Akash. 
So many signs. 
There has to be a reason.. something.. that is stopping us. 
Should we take some time? 
Two days? Four days? 
What's the date today? 
Seventh.. eighth November.. - 11th December. 
Yes, right. 11th December. 
Then 31st December. 
Means.. 11, 12, 13, 14.. - 20 days. 
18, 19.. - Its 20 days. 
Right. 
So 31st December. 
New Year's night. 
New Year's night. At 12 o'clock. 
We'll jump from that bridge. 
Its a pact. 
But what will we do in these 20 days? 
Things to do before you die. 
Everyone boasts of things that they wish to do before they die.. 
But never end up doing them. 
Anything. 
Fun, spontaneous, adventurous. 
Everyone does it to enjoy their life. 
We'll do it to die! 
No, its all nonsense. 
I can't do this. 
'Neither could I become someone's son..' 
'..nor could I become somebody's friend.' 
'Akash its over man, it just moved too fast.' 
'You were always in a hurry to make it big, weren't you? ' 
'You wanted to win every race.' 
'Shut down the company.' 
'Sell the office! ' 
'All of you were losers.' 
'All of you were losers! ' 
'Where will we go? How will we repay the loan? ' 
Tell me, how will we pay it back? ' 
So I guess, new year's night 
I guess. 
"Close your eyes when you don't see your destination." 
"When you close your eyes and seek you find the path to God." 
"Change your own fate." 
"Have courage and move ahead." 
"My footprints will show you the way." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
You can't report four hours late for work. 
This is completely ridiculous. 
You can't just walk-in whenever you feel like. 
You know what, you are fired. 
"Take a look at yourself." 
"Why did you give-in to the situation and give up." 
I was going to quit anyway. 
"Your courage can change your destiny." 
"Fill your world with the colour of your dreams." 
"I am always with you." 
"So what if the sun's setting." 
"You'll find my threshold when the darkness sets in." 
"And that is where you'll find new hope once again.' 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
"You're unaware that God's all around you." 
But why me first? 
Because knowing you.. 
..you must have a strange, complicated wish. 
Or you might not have a wish at all. 
No, no, of course I do. 
Really? Then tell me. 
Take your time. 
There's no hurry. 
"If wishes were horses." 
"Beggars would ride" 
"If the stars fell down from heaven.." 
"..I would make my wish now and tonight." 
Come on. 
Have you done everything? 
Isn't there anything that you wanted to do.. 
..but didn't get the chance to.. 
..or left it for later 
I mean.. there's got to be something. 
There's one thing actually. - Finally? 
Tell me. 
Can I.. get a beer? 
And that's your wish? 
I need the beer so that.. I can tell you what my wish is? 
That's nice. 
This seems like it's going to be a really good wish. 
Here. 
So.. I thought I'll wait. 
You know for.. for the right girl. 
Kiara! 
What? - You were sleeping. 
No. No, I wasn't sleeping at all. 
How could I sleep.. 
When I was listening very carefully.. 
To everything that you didn't say. 
Seriously. 
I am a virgin. 
Move. 
What did you say? - I have never.. 
You know.. I have never done it 
I never got the time. 
First I focused on studies and then my job. 
And it wasn't like I didn't have my opportunities.. 
Its just that I was waiting for the right girl. 
What? What is so funny? 
You're talking like a 15 year old girl. 
In fact.. even 15 year old girls don't talk like that here.. 
If I had a 15 year old daughter and she didn't talk like this.. 
..I'd break her legs 
I am sure. 
But to have a 15 year old daughter, you have to first be a father. 
And to be a father.. you have to.. - Yes, I know. 
Okay. 
But you're a lucky guy. 
Because tomorrow's the night. 
Where, ladies and gentlemen.. 
..a wish, a dream will be fulfilled. 
A wish will come true. 
Akash. Blush. 
Blush. Akash. 
Are you serious? 
Yeah.. Isn't she gorgeous? - Gorgeous? 
She'll feel bad. She's very sensitive. 
She'll feel bad? - Yes. 
Hi, baby, did you miss me because I missed you too. 
You missed me my blushy-wushy googly-poogly. 
Yeah. 
Does she work? or are we just here to pay her a visit? 
I know, I know. 
He can be a pain but try to manage tonight. 
The party starts now, baby. 
What are we doing here, Kiara? 
We've got to fulfil your last wish, remember? 
Peshto. 
How are you? - Oh my, God. How have you been? 
When did you arrive? You didn't even call. 
I know, I was slightly busy. 
Why do girls always meet each other.. 
..like they've been just been let out of the mental asylum. 
who is he? 
That.. - Hi, Akash. 
Akash. Oh, the virgin. 
Isn't it cute, Sam? 
Does everyone in this club know this? - Peshto. 
Not really.. - Kiara. Sam. - Sam, Kiara. - Hi. 
Hi. - Really nice to meet you. 
Hi. - Pleasure to meet you. 
Darling, I got to take this. - Okay. 
God. - So, did you like Sam? 
So cute, quite yum, I like him. - I know. 
Isn't he just.. - You do know that he's married, right? 
What? - What? 
No. 
I knew it. 
He's talking to his wife right now 
I can lip-read. 
You'll learn to too, if you work in the stock market long enough. 
He's telling her that he is out entertaining some Chinese clients 
But he was going to have dinner with me at Lobo tonight. 
There ain't no Lobo tonight, my darling. 
He's going back home. 
Darling, I got to go. Some problem with the shipment, alright. 
Bye. Take care. - Bye. 
Bye, guys. - Bye. Pleasure meeting you. 
C'mon Stay back. - I've to go. 
No, stay back. - I've to go. 
What about the party? - Work. - You.. 
Work! Bye. 
Screw it. 
Anyway, he was quite boring. 
And there are so many hot guys in here. 
I'll see you guys later. 
But listen.. - You guys have fun. 
And you.. you're not too bad. 
Bye. - Bye. 
Come on.. Let's hit the bar. 
Excuse me. Sorry. 
Can I have two large jacks, please? 
Nice 
So this, my friend, is your playground.. 
New York is officially the land of the single ladies. 
But first, you'll have to loosen up a little. Just.. 
I know what, have a drink. 
Finish, finish, down, down, finish. 
Kiara. 
Now we're talking! 
Keep your hand on the bar. 
Just one hand. 
Now Lean. 
Like that. 
Now, look around. 
Look all around. 
Please, don't stare like a despo. 
Smooth. Just like.. look around. Scan the place. 
Nice. 
Now pout. 
Slightly. My god! 
Okay. Cute. 
Okay, so you're ready for the kill. 
Now.. imagine that a very sexy, hot girl is standing next to you. 
Just imagine me, Now just hit on me 
Can I get you a drink? - Why? 
Are you a waiter? 
No, thanks. 
Can I buy you a drink? - Much better. 
Why should I let you buy me a drink? 
Because I've been noticing you for so long.. 
Please. That's the tackiest pick-up line ever 
I've been noticing you for so long. 
I can buy my own drink. 
So buy me a drink. 
Cheapo. 
So can I make you a drink? 
Nice. Now that I like. 
Hi, I am Akash. 
Kiara. - Unusual name. 
Like me. - Yeah. 
I like you. 
Nice.. Continue. 
We've got news.. the enemy has advanced. 
Their men are moving forward. 
They've captured most of our men. 
We don't have much time 
But what will happen if they find you, Gopal? 
There's nothing I can do. 
Radha, I will have to stay back. 
For my people. 
Till the end. 
You will have to leave. - But what about us? 
All those dreams, those promises? 
Tell me. 
We have just this night. 
This night. 
This moment. 
You're good. 
Okay. 
I am starting to get to know you a little too well.. 
..and I am not liking it. - Why? 
You were better off, as a stranger. 
"All the Anjaana's say yeah, yeah, yeah"

"because no one knows.. what will happen tomorrow." 
"Right now there's just happiness and you." 
"If we.. If we meet we'll start talking." 
"Wonder when.. We'll ever have a night like this again." 
"But now that we're together and it seems magical." 
"We don't have any worries." 
"We don't want to think about sorrows." 
"Lets move on.. before this journey ends." 
"It seems that fate has fulfilled my unspoken desires." 
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 
"Together they spun a story." 
"Anjaana.. Anjaani.." 
"Together they spun a story."

Hey, thanks. 
Congrats. 
Your first last wish has been fulfilled. 
Cheers. 
I couldn't do it. - Why? 
Are you gay? - No, idiot. 
Don't call me an idiot. 
Firstly, I try to help you, and then.. 
It's just that I couldn't do it. 
You should've told me earlier. 
We could've seen a doctor. Listen, it's a very common problem 
Listen, when I say I can't do it.. 
..I mean with a stranger, having paid her money 
Is it so difficult to understand? 
Look at me 
You think I didn't have any girlfriends.. 
or that I didn't get opportunities. 
It's just that.. I never felt it was right. 
I wanted to wait.. to fall in love. 
I know it's stupid. But that's just the way it is. 
Oh so basically you've Never been in love. 
So that's your wish. 
Oh, dude. 
That's a very difficult wish to fulfil. 
But.. Love isn't easy.. 
Oh no, just a minute. 
I've got an original one. 
What wish is one that can be easily obtained. 
What wish is one that can be easily obtained. 
Where there is no struggle in fulfilling it. 
Which once attained, should feel like an achievement 
Or else, life just goes by. 
Thank you. Thank you. 
That was very bad. 
Oh, God. Come on. 
You've got only 19 days.. to fall in love. 
Hey, the car is this way. 
Are you kidding me? 
I don't drink and drive. 
Okay, I'll drive. - Blush! 
No way. Only I drive her. 
Come on, we're walking. 
So the other day.. - Sorry. 
Go ahead. - No, you were saying something. 
Just that.. we've decided to live together for 20 days. 
And we don't even know.. 
..why we met on the bridge that night. 
Go on. 
Stock market crash. 
So you lost everything? 
And your family? 
My parents got divorced when I was eight years old. 
They kept fighting even after the divorce. 
My grandfather rescued me, and brought me here 
He educated me, sent me here. 
He passed away in 2001. 
And since then I am alone. 
Where are your parents now? - I.. don't know. 
What do you mean, you don't know? 
You don't even talk to them? 
Well, neither do they. 
So what, Akash? 
Did you even try? 
Oh my, God. 
Say it, I don't care, I didn't have time, blah, blah, blah. 
I don't understand today's generation.. 
And you took your parent's permission.. 
..before committing suicide, isn't it? 
You care a lot for them, don't you? 
So.. - What? 
Your turn. - Oh look, we're home. 
Kiara, where are you going? 
Come on. 
I lived in San Francisco with my family 
Kunal and my family had known each other for a really long time. 
Especially since we had migrated from India together 
And that day, as usual Kunal forgot my birthday. 
I had gotten used to it. 
But still used to get angry on him. 
He was used to this anger. 
Yeah, dad? 
Oh, Kunal hasn't called yet. - Goodnight, dad. 
Goodnight, baby. 
I've been trying to call you all day.. 
It either gets directed to voicemail or you just don't answer it. 
Okay, fine. 
I thought of calling you 
And it's you that always says "It's the thought that counts". 
I really thought of calling you. 
Kiara, it's your birthday. 
Be nice to people. Smile. 
It's my birthday, and I should be nice to other people? 
Yes, let's go now. 
Come on, come on that's enough now. 
I've got something to show you. 
Happy birthday to you. 
Happy birthday to you. 
Look at her, isn't she gorgeous? - You like her? 
Of course, Kunal. - Isn't it? 
You're buying a gift for yourself on my birthday. 
I mean how sweet is that. 
But, you do this every year. 
Camera. Electric guitar. 
Home theatre system. - Enough. 
PS3. And now this bike, Which is for me. 
All your gifts are for me. 
Thanks so much Kunal, I am so touched. 
I bought the camera to click your photographs.. 
And the home theatre, was for us to watch movies together 
And the guitar? 
That was to compose songs for you 
And the PS3? - PS3? 
OK fine, that's one thing, that I bought for myself. 
But this.. is for you to sit on. 
And you know what.. we will run away on this 
Come on. 
Hey. 
Hey, hi babe. - Hi. 
So this is it. 
Fourteen days until the wedding.. 
..and I see what the problem is. 
Your living room is your bedroom. 
And the bedroom? - Is more like a storeroom. 
Hey, babe, just pass me a beer. - Yes. 
I'll be right back. 
Hey, would you like a beer? - No, thank you 
Maybe a glass of wine? 
Or.. a cosmo? 
I don't drink at work. 
But here's my card. 
Give me a call at night. 
I'll drink anything. 
Okay, okay, break it up you two. 
Emanuel is a dream worker, aren't you? 
Honey, I am your fairy Godmother. 
We're going to transform this place. - Perfect. 
He really is a fairy 
Cheers. 
Be nice. - Bye, Emanuel. 
Okay, - The DVD collection. 
We'll talk later. 
And anyway, I am feeling sleepy. 
What are you doing? - Its called cleaning. 
You know, cleaning. - No, I don't know. 
And I don't want to know. 
You know, for the first time.. 
..I don't have anything to do after 9 o'clock. 
So I thought I'd do this. 
Where did this sofa come from? - This one? 
Yes. - It's your sofa. 
No. - Yes. 
It was hidden behind your pile of clothes. 
And yes.. I found your house key. 
Or should I say.. keys. 
Coffee. Low fat. 
What. I like full fat. - You're most welcome. 
Day 3, your turn to make a wish 
Why am I.. so scared of your wish? 
Okay. 
Let's just forget about these wishes. 
It's a bad idea anyway. - Why? 
Now that it's my turn, suddenly it's a bad idea? 
It's not like my wish has been fulfilled either. 
I will get your wish fulfilled. 
It will take time though.. And anyway we've got 19 days. 
Yeah right. 
Tell me.. or I'll just die out of suspense. 
So my wish is that we'll swim.. 
..in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, today. 
What? - Yes. 
That's dumb. 
Its minus two degrees and I don't indulge in such madness. 
Oh, so your wish is "Beautiful, special, you won't understand".. 
..and my wish is dumb? 
Kiara, that is suicide. - Really? 
Fine. 
Is this why you've kept me alive? 
"I will follow." 
"Anywhere you lead me." 
"I will follow you." 
"Yeah, every time you show the way." 
Bathing in the sea has made you even more salty 
Wouldn't it be so easy.. 
to forget everything and live each day happily.. 
To fulfil your every wish, like its your last day 
But life always interferes. 
Here. Write. - What? 
What you just said? 
Live each day like it's your last. 
Why? - Just write it. 
Leave. 
I wish that someone.. 
..without a reason to live, finds this. 
I wish that there's no one like that. 
Okay, its bikini time. 
Akash, where is my bag with the swimsuit. 
It must be there. - I don't really see it. 
I am sorry.. I forgot that bag on the jetty. 
What? - Yes. 
No, Akash. - I am so sorry. 
Come on, let's go back. 
Just a minute, we aren't going anywhere. 
How will we swim without our swim suits? 
Actually, I can. - How? 
Oh, come on. 
I have this. 
I am not going to take off my clothes. 
I am not shameless like you. 
I am shameless? - Of course. 
There's no one around here for atleast 10 kilometres, to see you. 
Look, I have no interest in seeing you undress 
Hey, watch it. - What else can I say? 
I am very interested in seeing you undress. 
But I control myself. Happy? 
That's why I think we should go back 
Don't put up a charade. 
Crazy woman. 
Wants to swim here in the cold. 
Akash.. My leg.. - Kiara! 
Akash. - Kiara! 
Kiara, catch! 
Catch! 
Oh God. 
Help! Help! I can't swim. 
Akash. 
I can't swim. 
The boat. 
The boat's drifting away, Akash. 
Is this why you forgot the bag? because you can't swim. 
If you weren't acting that you're drowning.. 
..we wouldn't be here and the boat wouldn't have drifted away 
So, now it's my fault? - Of course it's your fault. 
Is it my fault that you can't swim? 
I wonder which era you've landed here from. 
Now, I am stuck with you. 
I want to pee. - What? 
Here? Right now? - Yes. 
You.. you can't do it here. - What do you mean? 
How long can I control it? - I don't know. 
But doing it in the water, that's disgusting Akash. 
Why.. why don't you swim a little ahead? 
The waves will take it away 
Ew.. 
A wave like that one. 
Akash, what's that? 
Is that a shark? 
No, no, that's not a shark. 
It looks like a floating cloth. 
It looks like someone's boxers. 
You pervert. 
And I was standing next to you all this while 
Disgusting. 
My boxers. 
Go get them 
I told you I don't know how to swim. 
Could you please get them for me? 
I am not going to touch your boxers. 
Please, they'll float away. 
And I certainly don't want to die without them. Please. 
Thanks. 
I am sorry for all this. - Its okay. 
Anyway, you look rather strange saying sorry. 
You're better grumpy. 
You think we should hug.. 
It's very cold. 
Its so strange, isn't it? 
We tried so hard to die but couldn't. 
And today when we tried to live a little.. 
Anyway, you didn't complete your story. 
There's no one here to disturb us now. 
Hey, its me Rachael. Can't wait to see you. 
It's been five months since that night in LA. 
Finally you agreed to see me again. 
I forgot to give you my room number. I am at the Hilton.. 
And the room number is.. same as the one we were in LA. 
I'll be waiting.. 6pm.. Don't be late. 
Hi. - Hi. 
A friend of mine from LA, her name is Rachael. 
Could I have her room number please? 
I am sorry I can't give out that information.. 
..but I can go ahead and give her a call for you. 
Ya, please. 
There she is. 
Thank you. 
Hi. 
What floor? 
Same floor. 
Have a good night - You too. 
I am ready now, your room is done. 
Thanks. 
Hello. - Hey, Kiara. 
Hi Babes 
Kunal where are you? - Are you alright. 
I am at the restaurant, why? 
No, it's nothing. 
I'll call you later, okay. - Okay. 
"Falling asleep at the wheel." 
"Am still dreaming and still wheeling." 
"It's not where I expected to be. Am still wheeling." 
Can I get a beer? - Cheers. 
Hey, can I buy you a drink? 
"O God, am lost. Am drawn out so far." 
"O God.." 
"O God.." 
"Am drawn out so far." 
Yeah. 
Why god.. 
Why is my love so cursed 
Why god.. 
'And you know what.. we will run away on this' 
Why god.. Why is my love so cursed? 
And my heart shattered by his betrayal 
What happened to your hair? 
New look 
But I loved your hair, Kiara. - I know. 
You'll get used to this as well. - What's wrong? 
Is there something that you want to tell me? - No, nothing. 
Is there something I should know, Kunal? 
Kiara, what's wrong with you today? 
Anyway, I have to go to the restaurant.. 
..for an important meeting. 
Snap out of it. 
A meeting like last night's? 
Like the one at the Hilton Hotel? 
Like the one in room no. 504? 
Who is she? 
Rachael, from LA. 
I met her five months ago. 
And you had the nerve to give me this when you got back.. 
No, Kiara. No. 
Please. That was the first and the last time. 
I just went there yesterday, to tell her that it's over. 
It's over. 
Kiara, please forgive me. 
We don't need this. 
We're getting married in two weeks. 
I'll keep you very happy. 
I don't know why I strayed? 
Please forgive me. Please. 
I promise. I won't do it again. Please. 
Okay. I forgive you. - Really? 
I forgive you, Kunal. 
But you will have to forgive me as well. 
Because last night I did exactly what you did, Kunal. 
I slept with someone. 
Please, Kunal. 
Please forgive me. 
This will never happen again. 
I promise. 
We're getting married in two weeks, Kunal. 
We don't need this. 
I will keep you very happy, Kunal. 
I don't know why I strayed? 
This won't happen again, Kunal. I promise. 
Forgive me, Kunal. 
I tried a lot.. to live without him. 
But I failed. 
Every single time.. I just failed. 
"Everyone fades away with time." 
"Except for the one who accepts every difficulty as My will." 
"When you're completely alone." 
'I will always be besides you" 
"I was never separate from you." 
"You're unaware that God's around." 
"You're unaware that God's around." 
"You're unaware that God's around." 
"You're unaware that God's around." 
"You're unaware that God's around." 
"You're unaware that God's around." 
"You're unaware that God's around." - Kiara. 
"You're unaware that God's around." - Kiara. 
Kiara. 
'When you want to do something like this.. 
..you shouldn't think about it so much, you should just do it.' 
We need to shift the patient to the.. - Excuse me, doctor. 
One minute. 
All the.. - My friend is in there. 
How is she? 
My friend, how is she? 
She's fine. 
We saved her life.. 
..so that she can go out and try to commit suicide again. 
May I ask you what is wrong with her? 
Did she have a fight with someone? 
Did she lose her job or was she betrayed? 
It must be some stupid reason like that, isn't it? 
Have some problem, so do you want to commit suicide? 
You kids don't value life. 
Look at that man. 
He has terminal cancer. 
He has undergone four surgeries.. 
..and yet wants to live. 
So that his family keeps smiling. 
Unfortunately we won't be able to save him. 
And the one we saved doesn't want to live. 
What is wrong with you kids? 
Why don't you understand.. 
..that when someone dies, they don't die alone? 
Excuse me. 
"All the marks erases." 
"Now you're the reason.. for every happiness." 
"Now you're my sunshine each day." 
"Now everything will begin with you." 
"Now every path will lead only to you." 
"Now I am sure that my life belongs to you." 
"Now I am sure that my life belongs to you." 
Akash, She's absolutely fine. 
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 
"I will follow you everywhere.. like your shadow." 
"And never let you be alone." 
"I still couldn't find.. the moment that'd make you happy." 
"Whenever life tries to hurt you." 
"I will hide you in my arms and protect you." 
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 
"Everything starts with you now that you are with me" 
"I was unaware of your importance in the past." 
"I never knew that each moment will belong to you." 
"I request you." 
"Learn to live again." 
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 
"Now I am sure my life belongs to you." 
"Everything starts with you whenever you're around." 
"Everything starts with you whenever you're around." 
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 
"I wait for the signs so I know you are mine" 
"Everytime I look in the mirror, I see your face" 
"The walls break down down when you smile at me" 
"And the world's much brighter than the one I see" 
You're such a coward! 
Why are you hovering over me like a ghost? 
What do you mean by "Hovering"? 
What do you want, Akash? 
Alright! Day six. Your turn to wish 
Tell me what you want to do? 
Bungee jumping. 
Sky-diving.. I know what, let's swim again. 
I've learnt how to swim now. 
Come on, say anything. 
Are you alright? - Lets do something spontaneous, adventurous, fun. 
These three words.. and you? 
Are you on drugs? - Shut up. 
Come on, say something. 
I want to go somewhere far? - Where? 
Wait. 
Come on. - What? 
Stand up. 
That's a map and these are darts. 
We will go wherever the dart lands. 
You know like a holiday. 
Let it be, I was just kidding, Akash. 
Like that stupid swimming wish. 
I don't have any wishes. - Wait, wait. 
This could be my wish. 
You know, I've never been on a holiday. 
So I don't even know what a holiday is.. what happens on one. 
Never? - Yes. 
Really? - Really. 
But that's not really important. 
I could just carry on without knowing what it feels like. 
How does it matter? 
Hang on. 
You know what we should do this. 
In fact, we will do this. 
Give those to me. 
Really. - Yes, lets go. 
Come on. 
Where has it landed? 
Hell. - Is Hell even a place? 
It's in Michigan. 
Do you want to go there? 
Are you mad? 
Did I hit it right this time? 
I don't know. It's on some desert. 
Move. 
You didn't see it right.. 
It's Vegas. 
But what will we do in Vegas? 
Dude, you've no idea how much fun we'll have. 
Alright, let's go to Vegas. 
But we don't have the money to take a flight. 
I'll inquire about the greyhound bus. 
Akash. Let's drive? - Blush? 
Okay. 
"The winds are blowing slowly." 
"The paths are unfolding slowly." 
"All the paths to our destination are lit." 
"Like the stars of the sky have descended on earth." 
"There's a bright trail in the air." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"With you every moment is beautiful." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"With you every moment is beautiful." 
"as the evening sets in, there is a new ray that hits us" 
"it almost feels like its a new morning again" 
"darkness seems to be so far away" 
"hidden in the darkness are our secret desires" 
"and in a barren desert, we seek the rains" 
"and the heart starts beating faster" 
"as every moment feels all new" 
"and a new story begins" 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"With you every moment is beautiful." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"It's amazing." 
"With you every moment is beautiful." 
Are you alright? 
Yes, I am fine. 
What happened? 
Let me see what's wrong? - Listen. 
Wait here, I'll check. 
Blush. Blush. 
What's so funny? - Nothing. 
Come on, start the car. 
Are you okay? 
Are you okay baby? Did you get hurt? - Why are you taking so long? 
You have to understand that.. 
For God's sake, you're talking to this piece of crap again. 
Okay, okay, I am starting. 
Start now. 
Good girl. 
Okay. 
What is it? - Haven't you learned to share? 
I want to go to the bathroom. 
Yes, but we just crossed a sign.. 
..saying that there isn't a bathroom for the next 30 miles - What? 
I can't wait that long. 
Listen, I am not going to stop the car in the middle of the desert. 
I don't know whether this piece of crap will start up again. 
Control it for just half an hour. 
I can't, Akash. 
Did you let me do it in the water that day? 
I didn't say that I want to do it in the car. 
And what is this like.. pee revenge. 
You didn't let me do it.. so I won't let you do it 
I need to go means I need to go. - Okay, okay. 
I can't pee here, Akash? 
There's not a single tree around. 
Drive a little further. 
That's it, you've got two options. 
Either you get down here, or then wait for half an hour. 
I won't go searching the entire desert for a tree for you to pee. 
Fine. 
Akash. - What? 
What if there are snakes here? 
There can't be any snakes here, Kiara. 
How do you know that? - Well, because it's too bloody hot. 
And they aren't fools like us, you know. 
Listen, please come with me. 
If I have to come with you, then why not just pee right here.. 
..why do you want to go all the way there? 
Just come please. 
Let's go. 
Okay. 
Okay, okay, stop, stop. 
Now turn around.. 
..and close your eyes. 
Kiara, my back is facing you.. 
..why should I close my eyes.. - Just do it, quickly. 
Fine. - Ok, now shut your ears as well. 
What? - Shut your ears.. 
..and imagine that you're somewhere else. 
I am feeling shy, Akash.. - Fine, fine. 
My eyes are closed, so are my ears.. 
..and I am somewhere else. 
Okay. 
Oh shit. 
Stop! Stop! 
Stop! Stop! 
Hey, stop. 
Oh my God. They took Blush. - Stop. 
Why did you stop chasing them? 
Why didn't you stop them? 
Why didn't you stop.. 
Should I have turned into spiderman, and flown behind them? 
At least the car would've been here. 
Blush! 
Water. 
Akash. 
What? - Come. 
What? 
Oh my, God. 
Isn't that the thief's car? - Yes. 
Oh look, there is Blush. - Oh my Blush. 
My baby. 
Where are you going? 
To get the keys from those thieves. 
How? Do you even have a plan? 
I am not going to go inside a shady place like this. 
But of course, "Mr. Been there but never done it." 
You know what, you stay here while go in and get the keys. 
Just come in - But.. 
Look! There they are. 
But what if they recognise us? 
Your face was all black, remember? 
Thanks. - You're welcome. 
Kiara, you really don't need to do this. 
In fact, I won't let you do this. 
I'll think of a different plan, come on. 
Who said I am doing anything? 
You're on in five seconds. - Thanks. 
I mean I am not doing Anything.. you are. 
Good luck buddy. 
What do I do? 
Okay. Fine. 
"Give me a D." 
"Give me an I." 
"Give me a S." 
"Give me a C." 
"O." 
"I am a disco dancer." 
"I am a disco dancer." 
"Music is my life." 
"I'm smitten by this fool." 
"So dance, sway." 
"Come dance and sway with me." 
"I am a disco dancer." 
"I am a disco dancer." 
"I am a disco dancer." 
"Disco dancer." 
I am coming. 
Sir, please let me go. - Never. 
But you don't understand, I have never done this before. 
Don't worry, I'll be gentle. 
How do I explain to him? 
Sir, I am virgin, I've never done this 
Don't cry. 
Sir, please, 
Sir, stop, stop. 
Be a man. - No. sir, I am not a man, I am not a man. 
Don't cry like a little girl. 
I am a girl, sir. 
Sir, please stop. 
Sir, please stop. 
I am done for. 
I'll be ruined. 
Yeah, you're mine now. - Sir, I am not yours. 
Sir, not the room. 
Not the room. Not the room. 
Not the room, sir. Sir, for god's sake please leave me 
Okay. 
What is it? 
Room service. - Room service, I didn't order anything. 
Sir, somebody definitely Ordered some ice. 
Ice? I didn't order any ice. 
Who is it, honey? 
Ice. Did you order ice? - Yes I did. 
Come. 
Place it over the table. 
Yes, sir. 
He has fallen in love with me. 
You know, we're crazy about each other. 
Wow, that's so sweet. 
I am so happy for you guys. 
Thanks. 
That's so sweet. 
Now John, you promised. 
Do I have to? - You promised. 
Alright. Alright. 
Come on, Shave it all well 
Oh my, God. 
How did you manage to send him inside? 
Well, he has gone in to shave his chest hair 
I just told him that I hate chest hair.. - Really? 
Can we discuss this later? 
Run. 
"The breeze is blowing slowly now." 
"The way is opening for us now." 
"The destination is close." 
"Like the vast blue sky." 
"The breeze is blowing slowly now." 
Oh my, God. Akash, do something. 
What should I do? You do something. 
They're coming. 
Do something. Your car has stopped. 
Speak to her. 
Blush, all is well. All is well. 
It has started, it has started. 
We're not done with you. 
Wait. 
Oh, God. 
That was so much fun. 
Please. What if something had happened? 
I could've never faced anyone again. 
At least your last wish would've been fulfilled. 
Oh God. 
"Everybody come and party." 
"Everybody let's party." 
Thank you. 
And I am sorry. 
I am sorry that.. we made a pact.. 
..And I almost.. 
And thank you.. for doing so much.. 
You too look strange saying sorry. 
So where are we staying? 
MGM. Venetian, Bellagio. 
With just 50 dollars, 
Let us not get too greedy with raised collars, 
..staying in a motel is not a sin.. 
..let's just settle for our very own.. Happy Inn! 
Wow. 
This was my dream. 
To come to Vegas and stay here. 
Thanks, Akash. 
You know I never understand.. 
..when you're serious and when you're joking. 
In any case, I am not staying here for long. 
I am going to win a lot of money in the casino.. 
..and get us a suite in the Venetian. 
We'll be dancing in a suite tonight, got it. 
"Our.." 
"Our story.." - Shave it. 
"A saga young and old." 
"Covertly this story has moved ahead." 
By the way.. you can come without the shirt. 
I don't mind. 
"Until you arrived." 
"Our.." 
"Our story.." 
"A saga young and old." 
"Covertly this story has moved ahead." 
"It was at a standstill, until you arrived." 
"Your presence made me realise.." 
"..that you're my reason to live." 
"And I don't know why.. but I feel good" 
"Your presence made me realise.." 
"..that every journey turned beautiful." 
"And I don't know why.. I feel good." 
"A new direction." 
"New paths everywhere." 
"My path ended when I found you." 
"You were my companion, but you became my destination." 
"Our.." 
"Our story.." 
"The paths decide our fate." 
"Your presence made me realise.." 
"..that you're my reason to live." 
"And I don't know why.. I feel good." 
"Your presence made me realise.." 
"..that every journey turned beautiful." 
"And I don't know why.. I feel good," 
Kiara, hi. - Peshto. 
Hi. 
Hi! 
You, here? - You, here? - Oh God. 
Kiara! - Natasha. 
Akash. - Peshto. 
How are you? 
Guess what? 
I've finally found my Mr. Perfecto. 
Really! In a week? 
I met him on the flight, - Yes, but.. 
You know when something feels right from within.. 
Yes. 
Okay, come on. 
There's a big party upstairs. Let's go. 
"Come on." 
You came back? 
You are drunk Kiara. - Excellent observation. 
You know, Akash, if I didn't know you.. 
..I would feel that you were slightly jealous. 
Because you left so quietly. 
So.. were you jealous because I was enjoying myself? 
..or because I was enjoying without you? 
If you were really enjoying so much.. 
..then why would you be here? 
How can you be so sure each time? 
So Logical? 
So Confident? 
Go to sleep, Kiara. 
We've to got to leave early in the morning 
But we've still got the night. 
Running away from every situation. 
There are some things about you that don't change. 
This isn't funny anymore, Kiara. 
I never said I was joking. 
Good morning. 
Coffee, ma'am. 
Black, low-fat. 
Are you okay? 
What's wrong, Kiara? 
Why do I feel.. that I am cheating on Kunal? 
Last night.. 
Why am I feeling so guilty? 
You know even the other day.. I didn't do anything. 
I left the bar with that man. 
"I am sorry.. I can't do this." 
Akash, I can't do this to Kunal. 
I have imagined my entire life with him. 
Since I was three years old. 
And.. it has always been Kunal, for me. 
And maybe.. it will always be Kunal. 
You didn't betray him last night either, Kiara. 
There is nothing between us. 
Last night too, nothing happened between us 
Black, low-fat. 
I like full fat. 
You're most welcome. 
Thanks. 
Come on, we've to go far. 
"My eyes are wet as rain, with the sorrow of the pain." 
"My eyes are wet as rain, with the sorrow of the pain." 
"The dark nights seem like my companion." 
"I've nothing left in these deserted paths." 
I had imagined my entire life with him 
"I say this every moment to myself." 
"I've forgotten you." 
"I've forgotten you." 
"I've forgotten you." 
"So then why do your memories.." 
"Make me cry." 
"Make me cry." 
"Your memories still haunt me." 
"losing my love has left me to complaint" 
"if he had to separate us then why did he bring us together" 
"you must have fallen in love too, and lost your love, oh god" 
"you will understand the pain of separation" 
"The dark nights seem like my companion." 
"I've nothing left in these deserted paths." 
What are we doing in San Francisco? 
Akash, will you say something? 
Weren't we going home? 
Not us.. 
You are going home. 
What are you saying? 
Why were we on that bridge that night, Kiara? 
What's the point of this discussion? 
Because both of us had lost the one thing we loved the most in life. 
Think about it Kiara 
We met on that bridge, our story began from there. 
But that doesn't mean it has to end there. 
We tried to die so many times. 
How many chances did we give death? 
Five. 
And life? 
How many times did we try to solve our problems? 
Sit down and face them? 
Not even once. 
And we say that life's not fair. 
In these past few days I have learnt that.. 
..no matter how many reasons you have to die.. 
..you need just one to live. 
I found your reason, Kiara. 
You have a beautiful family, you have Kunal. 
Everything can go back to what it was. 
If you just give him a chance. 
You still love him, Kiara. 
You're doing all this because I don't love you, Akash. 
You're very bad at handling rejection. 
It's not about me, Kiara. - Oh yeah Mr. Hotshot Wall Street guy. 
You're actually thinking about someone else, wow. 
Yes, Kiara, maybe I can think about someone else. 
I'm not saying that Kunal didn't do anything wrong. 
But that's what a mistake means. 
It is possible for you love someone,, 
..but make the mistake by straying away with someone else. 
It could've happened with you too last night. 
It's possible, Kiara. 
Go back to him. 
You know your happiness lies with him. 
Everything can be just as it was. 
Where you felt that you're the luckiest girl in the world. 
There's just a slight change. 
Now Kunal is the luckiest boy in this world. 
What is your address? 
I am sorry, Akash. 
For all that I said in a fit of rage.. 
..I didn't mean them. 
Take Blush with you. 
Her? 
But, she only listens to you. 
She will now start listening to you too. 
How will I know that you're fine? 
Where will I call you? 
You won't have to. 
I will call you. 
Aakash. 
"I separated from you for a while, and my path changed" 
"I started losing you and I felt something started going away" 
"my very own was not mine anymore" 
"You pray for me now." 
"You relieve me from this pain." 
"I couldn't be yours." 
"I say this every moment to myself." 
"I've forgotten you." 
"I've forgotten you." 
"I've forgotten you." 
"So why did your memories.." 
"Make me cry." 
"Make me cry." 
"Your memories follow me everywhere." 
"Those forgotten moments ask me why we ever separated." 
"There's this huge distance between us." 
"God, you created this distance." 
"God, what was destined to happen has happened." 
"What you had written in our fates." 
"The dark nights seem like my companion." 
"I've nothing left in these deserted paths." 
Oh my, God. Akash. 
Deven, look who is here. 
Hi. 
Where did you disappear to? 
You had everyone worried? 
Who is it, Sapna? 
Rohan, stop scattering your toys. 
Can't you look where you're going? 
Akash. 
Dude. 
Where did you disappear to? 
You had everyone worried? 
I got that. 
Do all married couples say the same line? 
Very funny, come on in. 
Kiara. Hi. 
Hi, I.. I, - Come in, please. 
No, I should go. 
Kiara. Come in. 
I guess it's a sign. 
Bye, Kunal. 
Your house is still on the way to my restaurant 
come on, please let me drop you 
I am really sorry, Deven. Sapna. 
It's all my fault. 
If I wasn't so aggressive.. - Akash, when in good times.. 
..we all made a lot of profit. 
Because of you Isn't it? 
Deven, please explain to him. 
Why do you twist your words so much? 
You men and your speeches. 
Hello, what's so funny? Why are you smiling? 
No. nothing. 
You just reminded me of someone. 
A girl. 
Wow, it's finally happened. Who is she? 
Sapna, stop it. 
Our world is crashing down here.. 
..and you girls can only think about romance. 
Akash, we want to say that.. 
..we've decided to go back to India. - What? 
We feel that you should come to India with us 
Deven.. - No one can attract business like you do. 
Akash, Deven is right. 
You guys are just made for each other. 
Only in business. 
When are you'll leaving? 
On the night of 31st. 
That's when you get the cheapest tickets. - Shut up. 
Let's go. - What? 
Let's go. 
I am really sorry, Kiara. 
I am really sorry. 
Can't we start again, please? 
Can we not start again? 
As friends? 
Yeah. As friends. 
Sorry! 
"Everything seems faded." 
"Wonder what's wrong with me." 
"Everything and everyone looks unfamiliar." 
"I've a similar grievance." 
"Everyone I have come across these days" 
"Seemed unfamiliar." 
"there is a slight sadness here" 
"though so close, yet you are unfamiliar" 
"Though so close yet you're unfamiliar." 
"Though he was a stranger." 
"But he was mine." 
"She might be a stranger." 
"But she's somewhere around." 
'Where are your parents now? ' 
'You didn't even talk to them.' 
Dad, Akash here. 
"Since I found out that I'll never get to know you again." 
"I started keeping away from love." 
"Since I realised I will never think about you again." 
"my heart always made some excuse" 
"Everything we didn't speak about." 
"Why didn't you ever say them?" 
"There's so much to say." 
"Happiness is waiting with arms stretched," 
"but I can still feel the void" 
"Though he was a stranger." 
"But he was mine." 
"She might be a stranger." 
"But she's somewhere around." 
You look beautiful, Peshto. 
Thanks, you look great too. 
Thank you. 
You know, he loves you a lot. - Yeah, I know. 
But he isn't as lucky as Kunal. 
Who are you talking about? 
Come on, you girls. 
31st December. 
New year night. 12'clock. 
We will jump from that bridge. 
Attention, guys. 
To Peshto and Nikhil. 
The first wedding in our group. 
Here's wishing you guys a long and happy marriage. 
And if anybody has any objections, now is the time to say it. 
Cheers everybody. 
Wow, super. 
'Do you believe in signs? ' 
Your coffee, black. Low fat. 
'Coffee, low fat.' 
Who is he? 
Tell me. 
I am sure, this time I've lost you forever. 
And this time, I am not wrong. 
You're right. 
So, who is he? - Kunal.. 
His name isn't Kunal. 
I don't even know what it is. 
I have only known him for the past 20 days and it feels like 
You can never forget him. 
Yeah! 
And maybe I'll never meet him again. 
I don't even know where he is. 
Or where he stays or where he'll be 
I don't even have his phone number. 
All I know is that tonight.. 
..we were supposed to meet in New York. 
So? 
So what? - Go. 
He won't be there. - How can you be so sure? 
Because.. 
Oh my, God. Peshto. I am not sure. 
He could be there. 
I didn't even think about it. 
I should go, right? - Yes. 
But I have to be there by 12 o'clock. 
What is the time now? - Its 1 o'clock. 
And what is the time difference in New York. 
Three hours. 
There's a flight to New York every hour. 
I'll take you there. - But, Kunal. 
Well, what are friends for? 
"You are my sunshine, my sunshine." 
"You are the only one." 
You guys are so cute. 
Kunal, I just want to tell you.. - Just go, Kiara. 
Get the hell out of here. Its an order. Now. 
Thanks, Kunal. - Go, go, go. 
"You are the sunshine." 
See you. 
What happened to the house? 
There's still one hour to go for it to be 12 o'clock. 
At least go and see whether she's there or not 
She is happy where she is. 
Taxi. 
Towards the Washington bridge please. 
Make it fast! 
"God. Is the sun shining somewhere far?" 
"You and I have found a reason to live again." 
"If you want we can find our destination again." 
"Our paths will cross again." 
"I am running towards where my world is." 
"Though he was a stranger." 
"But he was mine." 
"She might be a stranger." 
"But she's somewhere around." 
You're getting married? 
Why? 
Are you proposing to me? 
You? 
Remember.. I have no interest in you 
Zilch 
I don't know if I should be relieved.. 
..or then begin to wonder why you aren't interested in me? 
Not that I want you to be interested in me. 
You know what I mean? 
Then what are you doing here? 
You're all dressed up 
Yeah and I've done my hair too. 
You do know that we're going to jump into the water? 
And your hair will get really messed up. 
Probably. 
Because jumping from here.. 
..is like jumping from the 100th floor of a building. 
Splat! as soon as you land. 
Do you have a better option? - Yeah, there is another one.. 
But it's slightly romantic. 
Instead of jumping from here.. 
..we could just go down and walk into the water. 
Oh my, God. Its really cold. 
Just a little bit longer. 
And we won't even feel it anymore 
So.. it was really nice knowing you. 
Yes, you too. 
It's cold. - Really. 
Isn't the moon looking so pretty today? 
Why are you talking like a girl? 
Really? - Yes. 
Oh my, God. Akash, look. 
What? - That's our bottle. Over there. 
Where? 
There. - No, that can't be our bottle. 
Wait, I'll go get it. - Kiara. 
Our bottle. - Kiara. 
Kiara. Kiara. - I got it. 
Are you okay? you okay? 
Look, this isn't out bottle.. 
..but there's a note inside this one too 
Alright. 
We tried to die together many times.. 
..and it was so much fun. 
Just imagine.. how great it would be if we decided to live together. 
I don't want to think, I just want to live.. 
..with you. Kiara. 
Forever and ever. 
Till the day I die. 
Akash 
Oh my, God. 
Akash 
What is this? 
Oh my, God. 
It's a ring. Where did this come from? 
Finally. 
Where did you get it from? 
Kiara, I am proposing to you. 
Oh, sorry. - Continue. 
Kiara, will you. 
Oh my, God. It's you again. 
Oh no. You dropped the ring. 
Come on. 
Come on. 
Could you dim the light please? 
You're killing the mood. 
Akash - So, will you.. 
Kiara. Kiara. Kiara. 
Yes, I will. I will. 
Is it a yes? - Yes. 
You found the ring? - Yes. 
And I said yes as well. 
Then why don't you wear it. 
Stupid, you are supposed to make me wear it 
But if you want I can wear it myself. 
No wait, give me the ring. 
Your fingers are quite fat. 
No, they are not. 
They just tend to swell up when it's cold. 
Shall we put the ring on the little finger then? 
Yes. 
There. 
Your wish has been fulfilled. 
Well that's going to happen a little later, if you know what I mean 
I love you Kiara. 
I love you. 
"Close your eyes when you don't see your destination." 
Are you guys trying to commit suicide in the cold? 
No, we're getting married. 
Oh my, God. 
That is worse than suicide.
