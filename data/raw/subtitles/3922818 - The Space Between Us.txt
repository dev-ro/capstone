I want to go to Mars
No just a visit
I want to live there
Because then I would believe in truth
that life on mars
Is possible..
Proof that if we had to
Mankind can make a fresh start
We are in trouble
and it's our fault
and we're running out of time
and mother nature doesn't negotiate
we can't give up, not now
Mars is a planet
Right and ready for life
Earth's resources might be depleted but
there is one resopurce we must never neglect
It's the most valuable
And it's the one without limits
Courage
I wrote those words
I wrote those words
when I was 12 a years old
My letter to the white house
Never did I imagine
The President would read them loud to Nation
Mourning the loss of the another
crew of the astronauts
Never did I dreamed
That I would be proclamimed
and emblem of fortitude
The Young man
with the singular version
and the rest is, well,
It's not history
Just the begining
Here we all are.
Thanks to Genensis
space technologies...
in 20 hours The Magelan 61 will travel
6 astronauts to Mars
not to visit but to live there
the first true citizens of Mars
From a childhood vision to the greatest
spacing gather the world has ever attempted
The settlement known as East Texas Mars
Come on say it with me
"Just Add Water"
Well whatever I am...
I can not begin to compare
to these 6 heros
Living examples of courage without limits
And on that note I would like to hand
things off to the mission head with this
historic expedition,
Lead Astronaut Sarah Elliot
Sorry if we only have time for a couple of questions.
You know what it's like the night before a trip
Scott Hubbard, Aerospace Times.
Miss Elliot,
how does is feel to sacrifice?
The next four years of your life
It's not a sacrifice
It's an opportunity
I feel... I feel humbled
excited and greatful for the chance
to be a pioneer
Miss Elliot aren't you scared?
Given the history, given the dangers?
Of course
I'm scared that I might let the mission
down in some way
I was taught that people who took risks with
out fear were brave
or far braver those who
take risk despite their fear
Courage is fear that has said it's prayers
T minus ten, nine, eight...
seven, six, five, four...

Igninition. Launch.

Shuttle speed is good.
Watch your drift Sarah.
Contact.
Not yet, not yet.
mounted manual grip.
- let's go, come on!
- Let's go.
TWO MONTHS LATER
You okay?
yeah I'm fine
Sarah, can I have a word?
What's up?
Show it to me
We can't just turn the
mission around correct?
Doctor, how is she doing anyway?
You mean besides from being mortified?
She is fine
Oh this is a disastar
Nathaniel, she's due shortly after
they arrive.
we need to get out in front of this
An astronaut behaved irresponsibly and
NASA will make a decision what
to do as soon as the baby is born
- Decision about what?
- About when to bring them back
Tom, this is a bigger issue here
Subjecting a foetus to zero gravity
during it's entire gestation
It's unchartered territory
We don't go to press
we keep this internal for now
we need to gather more information
What are you saying?
I'm saying we go short term contingency
we have Dr Loh deliver the baby on Mars
we keep this quite
we wait this out
Sarah may have behaved irresponsibly
but she's no longer just an astronaut...
and it's not just a genesis decision
She is...
A mother now..
It's her decision too.
Push push push
Well done. Take a deep breath, here we go.
Push push push..
Okay, good
Keep breathing. You're doing great.
One final push.
- Take a deep breath.
Is he okay?
Well done..
he looks good.
Sarah? Sarah? Pulse zero?
Her heart rate's dropping.
Push two milligrams of lorazepam.
Take it easy.
- She is still not responding.
- Give her 20 milligrams.
Come on, Sarah, breathe.
- How long?
- Thirty minutes without a heartbeat.
Stop. Stop CPR.
She's gone. She's gone.
Mr. Shepherd,
are you there?
We lost her.
Okay, here is what we know
2/3 rd less gravity
will alter the child's internal organs
The heart will simply not be conditioned
to have the strength to
pump in the earth's gravity
Bones will be brittle
Probably oversized
The child will never survive
the trip back to earth'
Yeah but Nathaniel in the eyes of the world
Isn't this whole mission East Texas
an experiment? Wouldn't it be forgiven
Tom, this is not a mouse
This is not a monkey
This is a human being
and in the eyes of the world...
The lead astronaut with the
Genensis Mars mission not only got pregnent
but died in child birth...
sentencing a baby to a
motherless existance in outer space,
Imagine the bloody outcry
East texas runs on
money science good face...
and above all, good PR.
Remember we're talking about a secret
we're talking about a cover up
It will bring the company down.
- Unless...
- Unless what?
Unless we don't cover up we take full
responsibility we face it head on.
Chuck
I want to on the next mission
As a passenger?Yes
Nathaniel, for the love of God.. Here we go
No, Actually he's right.
There would be no better show of support
Thank you, Alice. Exactly,
Can you imagine their morale right now.
They have just lost their leader.
Nathaniel it is out of the question
And you know it
Am I missing something here?
Doctor, will you enlighten Alice please?
Hydrocephalis
We founded on Mr Sephard's
very first medical
a congenital brain disorder
It's basically benign...
Beningn, Unless he wants to go
into outer space and then
I wanna find willing to take that risk
Sorry not happening
So the child remains on Mars?
I dont see any...
We don't have a choice.
Say we come clean
and we loose our financing.
say we..we..
we give up
everything we fought for
Say we bring everyone home
You've heard the doctor that
the child wouldn't even make the trip
keeping this a secret
saves the company...
which saves East Texas,
which saves the child
So the child remains classified?
Yes
I'm sorry. Yes.
Can I bring your car around Mr shepherd?

<b>16 YEARS LATER</b>
Huh, there you are
Centaur, can you make me a map?
And what is it you like a map of
Gardner Elliot?
a pathway through the ventilation system
from my quater to the
storage facility on east texas
And why would you like that information
That's none of your business
It is my business
I'm you best friend
No you are a machine with
Rudimentary artificial intelligence
A machine which I helped to build
That hurts my feelings
You don't have feelings
I do have feelings, I am you best friends
I am your teacher
I am you homie. Hug it out.
Get me a map with ventilation system
Information classified
- I am sorry
- No I am sorry
Information classified.
Gardner, don't, I am your friend
Garner, stop. Once upon a time

Mission number.
We're running out of time
and...
"Mother Nature does not negotiate."
Letter to the White House and
he is twelve years. Blah, blah.
- Sorry, if we only have time
for a couple of questions.- Hey, Mom.
<b>WHERE ARE YOU?</b>
To be continued.
Colony 52-B,
report to the automatic airlock.
You're late.
Hey, Kendra. what's up?
Have you seen this?
I mean So cool.
- I mean
- Works better if you turn it on.
The irrigator on 23 is blocked.
By the way, I can't reach Centaur.
What have you done with him this time?
- Are you checking up me?
- Next time, you know
I'll be checking up on Centaur
Yeah, who checks up on me.
I don't fool me, Gardner Elliot.
You never have
23 should be clear
Really?
Thanks a lot.
Here.
- Thanks
Ok, get on the 17 now.
we won't make you indespencible yet.
How can I be indispensable
if no one knows I exist?

Come.
You want it? Get it, come get it.
Go fetch it.
What would you do without me?
I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm miss you too.
Come on.
Replay.
Memo.
Print.
- Centaur, some privacy.
- Again?
All you ever ask for is privacy these days.
I remember time when you and I...
Where's the code?
Hi, Tulsa.
Stay with me.
- Why?
Because misary loves company.
- What are you miserable?
Just Dealing with basic people at school.
Everybody is always fronting.
Nobody is ever real, you know.
My best friend is not even real.
- Tell me about it.
Anyway, the second I turn 18,
I'm so outta here. Emancipation...
"Emancipation, mobility, music."
No, Tulsa, I just wish I could go with you.
You've been saying that since last summer.
And you can.
- No I can't.
- Oh, right, you can't leave your house.
It's not a house,
it's a penthouse on Park Avenue.
I can't leave because of my disease.
Osteogenesis imperfecta.
- Yeah, still don't believe you.
Will your foster dad be unhappy?
- Yeah, no more checks from the state.
The study lab is over. Gotta go.
See you in the funny papers
What does that mean?
You always say that. What does it mean?
I do not know. I had a foster sister
in Oklahoma who used to say it all the time.
Just different way of saying 'goodbye'.
I like it. Talk tomorrow?
I'm not going anyhere.
Where did you get this movie?
One of the German scientists
who was here last month.
How do you know what's going on?
- Excuse me, please?
Excuse me?
- It's easy
You see those men there? They are angels.
They look over the people on earth
and make sure they are okay.
Do you see that angel?
He is gonna fall in love with her
and fall to earth.
You're a romantic.
Then he won't be an angel anymore.
He'll be just like her.
Hey, Tulsa, give us even a ride, you slut.
What up, Chuck? Don't get up because of me.
"Hi, honey, how was your day?
Making new friends yet? "
Oh you...boy am I fighting 'em off?
I'm the most popular girl in my class.
Did you get Thursday's check yet?
I would not want you...
Wait a second. It's Thursday. Hey, hey
Chuke, Chuck, wake up.
You gotta do the Sanders farm.
Hey come on, wake up.
You have one single property.
Pretty simple alright? 15 minutes tops.
DISARMED
Okay, the starter.
Try the brakes.
It doesn't have brakes.
Alright Check the sprays.
- Checked
- Not while I'm standing behind the plane.
Ok, we are gonna loose some of the property.
- You do it.
You can fly this thing. You do it.
Awesome parenting, seriously
Risk my life for a 190 plucks.
Good to know how my life is worth to you.
- Help
- It's okay. I got you.
You're okay. You're okay.
I'm right here.
Are you insane? Do you think that the
protocol does not apply to you?
You could have caused an atmospheric breach,
not to mention die.
No body rides unaccompanied,
no matter who they are
Gardner, What is going on here?
This is not like you.
You wouldn't understand.
My mother is out there.
How did you get past the electronic lock?
That magnetic implant
is there to monitor the growth of
your organs. It doesn't serve as a pass key
- And how do you even learn how to do that?
- Raised by scientists in a bubble.
Open.
That plaque for your mother
is just a piece of metal in the ground.
Okay?
Her ashes was spread
across the Pacific Ocean.
You deserve to know that.
She's not out there, Gardner.
She is in you.
I do not like to go to sleep
with us in a fight.
We are not in a fight.
This is how you greet an old friend?
If he is unannounced, yes.
It's about the boy.
Mr. Shepherd, you have no idea
how smart he is.
he is being denied connection.
Not to do this at this point
I'm sorry. It would be inhumane.
Miss Wayne, I am touched by your concern,
I really am...
But none of this matters, if he
can't survive. We have been through this.
For starters we will have to add
carbon nanotubes to strengthen
his bone density.
It's a very complex procedure.
It's, it;s...Too riskey. I'm Sorry.
Tom, I can not sign on to this.
With all due respect, Nathaniel,
I am not asking. I am telling.
You've been gone for 16 years.
- Have you run this one NASA?
NASA has always felt conflicted over this.
They want to do the right thing,
which this is.
They want to bring the boy home.
Look, This is our chance
to turn bad PR to good PR.
This has nothing to do with PR.
I'm talking about a boy's life.
hang on, hang on. Like it or not,
but I'm still the founder.
Like it or not,
East Texas is still my brainchild.
You know, you got a lot more faith
in how the public will respond than I do.
I have some news.
Guess what.
You are taking me to Bora-Bora?
That was a joke. As you were.
They may have found a cure for my disease.
Okay, Mine was closer to the truth.
But mine is the truth.
It will involve an operation.
And some physical therapy.
Pick it up, Pick it up,
you got it, keep going. there you go.
Remember why are you running for.
Assuming all goes well,
I'll be coming to see you.
Cool, and when is this happening?
In a few months.
There is a longer travelling.
Do not take forever.
Once the foster care spits me out, I'm gone.
See you in the flying papers.
File 32: human courteship.
Here we are. Allow me?
Well, I guess chivalry not entirely dead.
atleast not in Nantucket.
"At least not in Nantucket." Repeat.
Here we are. Allow me, won't you?
Well, I guess chivalry not entirely dead
atleast not in Nantucket.
Bravo. Well done.
Are you gonna visit your ex-husband?
I've hacked into the scientist's records.
You are the clever computer stalker.
Why did you get divorced?
He changed when he found out
we couldn't have children.
did that make you sad that
you could not have children?
That's a tough one.
It meant I did not have to choose.
Motherhood was not a dream
I was chasing at that time
My father is somewhere on that thing.
Earth. We could go and find him.
We do not have to tell him who I am.
I could just see him.
Maybe I can ask for the time.
No one has to know.
- Do you know where he lives?
- No.
His name?
Gardner, I promise, I don't know
anything about him. Nobody does.
How am I supposed to act on Earth?
with the people.
Mr. Shepherd?
Your coffee.
CURRENT MISSION CREW
Excuse me Sir,
doyou have an appointment?
- Tom.
- Sir.
- Tom.
- Nathaniel... Stop!
What are you doing here?
- I am here to meet him.
- Impossible.
- No, what's impossible...
his shuttling back and forth to Mars.
What's impossible is
building our salvation there.
But I made those things happen,
so you tell me what's impossible
Gardner, Gardner
how are you feeling?
- Water.
- everything okay?
Water.
- Are you thirsty?
- No, no there is...
- Get this back on.
- There is water everywhere.
I feel so heavy.
But why. Is that normal?
- I believe the term is 'euphoria'.
Sorry about the quarantine.
It's to protect you from us,
not us from you.
Same bubble, different planet.
Nothing has changed. has it?
But Except that.
It is so blue, and green.
There are so many colors.
I'm Nathaniel Shepherd.
How you doing?
I am Fine. I just weigh too much.
I know who you are.
I want to be them.
Well, It's Funny,
because they want to be you.
I got so many questions about Mars.
- Not as many as I have over earth.
- You'd be surprised.
I'll go first.
What is your favourite thing about earth?
Rain. My turn.
What is your favourite thing to do on Mars?
- To Pretend it's earth. My turn.
Did you see my mother die?
- No.
yes.
Yes. I'm..
I am Sorry.
What scares you?
- You. You're very disarming.
Are you gonna kick me on out of turn?
- Yes.
Can I stay on earth?
- I can't answer that.
Why rain?
- Because it washes everything clean.
- Kendra.
- Hello.
We meet in person.
How you feel?
Heavy.
What's getting me concerned are these
inconsistencies in this last batch.
What about blood?
Blood work is virtually normal,
but if we are going to...
Virtually? Virtually,
Is that what we do around here now?
Virtually, because I like to think.
Meaning Troponin.
Testing for troponin is my point.
Run the test for troponin, please.
- Troponin. Troponin it is.
They need to do more tests.
They already did their tests.
They said I am fine.
I know that.
- I am more than fine.
They are sending me back to Mars,
aren't they? - They did not say that.
No they don't have to.
There has been a breach here.
Quarantine.
Word of warning guys,
these are the real deal.
The boots are weighed
for gravity compensation.
As if you're from Mars returning to Earth.
It's going to feel very different.
I don't believe this.
He has turned the pressure.
Raised by scientists.
Lock it down. This is not a drill.
Ah, there he is.
Where does that go?
- Zone H. He has headed to service.
Relax, it's a dead end.
He changed.
Ok, guys, Check the loading dock.
<b>DISARMED</b>
Thanks.
Alright, Let it go.
I have to talk to you.
Gardner trusts me, he doesn't trust you.
Kendra, give me a minute.
We need teams on the
Washington Avenue Amtrak station...
- the airport and cover the bus stations.
- I'm coming with you.
Kendra. Thank you but I'm good. State
police are helping with blockades.
They will be told he needs
a heart transplant
and the donor suddenly become available.
I promise, I promise I
will keep you updated.
You claim to be concerned
about Gardner's health
but I think you care more
about keeping him secret.
You were saying?
It's one of four ambulances. Come on.
You found Waldo.
I'm Gardner.
This fire..
It is so, so warm.
- I like your shades.
- I like yours.
You wanna trade?
- Do you know where Colorado is?
- Used to.
Greyhound station is about a
3 iron in that direction.
- Golf phrase. You play?
- Used to.
What's your favorite thing about earth?
Dreaming. How about you?
So far?
Meeting you.
Weird kid.
This is so cool.
Open.
Close. Open.
What's your favorite thing about earth?
How do we know for sure
he's going to see her?
Because she's the only person
he knows on earth.
Alright. Read that to me.
There she is.
She was left at the Tulsa Oklahama child
welfare services when she was 4 years old.
A girl named Tulsa happened
to be abandoned in Tulsa?
It's her nickname. She's lived in five
foster homes over the last twelve years.
She know his story?
He told her he was confined
to a Park Ave penthouse.
and had osteogenesis imperfecta.
Brittle bones.
Put the address in the sidetrack.
We'll land close
but not too close. I don't wanna spook him.
- Hey hello.
- Get away from me... Okay
Gentlemen.
It's me.
It's Gardner.
- What was that for?
- Why did you ghost me like that?
Ghost? You completely shut me off. You
didn't return any of my messages.
I told you I was taking a trip?
For seven months? People have phones
you know. You can text, email...
I couldn't contact you. It was a
very specific type of travel.
Very specific type of travel?
Who even talks like that?
Tulsa. Can you slow down?
This gravity is very heavy.
Oh. I'm sorry but this is heavy for you.
But I really do not appreciate being
blown off by the one person who I...
Tulsa. I would never ghost on you.
Okay. I have actually gone
through quite a lot to get here.
"The only person who what?
Who I don't hate.
- You're taller than I thought you'll be.
- You're meaner than I thought you'll be.
What are you wearing?
This is so weird.
I have a lab, okay.
so... I don't know.
Can you just stay here? Alright.
Do not move, Gardner.
And those were the highlights of the
19th century industrial revolution.
Now. The 20th century had some
of the greatest inventions...
Hello.
- Hello.
And you are?
- Gardner.
Are you a transfer student?
- Okay.
Where are you from Gardner?
- East Texas.
- Don't think I have you on my roster.
- Okay.
Alright folks. Telephone.
- I told you to wait for me.
- I've waited long enough.
... One father. Who is he?
- Thomas Edison.
Good. Give me one fact about Thomas Edison.
- Dude was badass.
Edison wasn't a badass.
- Excuse me?
Edison invented direct current, but
it was Nikola Tesla who invented
alternating current.
Edison got jealous and claim
AC electrocuted pets.
To prove it, he
electrocuted an elephant.
That's not badass.
That's a bad person.
You see folks. You learn something
new every day. Thank you er...
Excuse me. That's our
emergency eye wash spray.
So the operation worked.
You're all better now?
- Tell me where are you really from?
- Mars.
You're from Mars?
Alright. Fine. Don't tell me.
Okay. Look at this.
This is my mother.
- She died.
- I'm sorry.
What for? It wasn't your fault.
It was mine. I killed her.
But this is my father. You're
going to help me find him.
I don't know where he is, but...
Well. You have your
father's smile.
I found the house. Route 14,
latitude 40, 34 longitude.
Alright. You stay here.
Gardner.
- Gardner. You need to come with me now.
- No.
We are here to help. You're
putting yourself in great danger.
Why can't you just leave me alone?
This is my life.
Gardner. Gardner. Please. Come on.
- I'm going to find my father.
He's all I have.
- That is not true. You have me.
No. I don't. Kendra. You told me yourself.
You don't want children.
Gardner. That's not what I meant.
You know that.
You never wanted children.
And I'm sorry you had
to raise me at all.
I'll get the van. You go.
Duck.
Sorry.
Alright. You're gonna need to get in.
Hurry. Cmon.
Gardner. Let's go.
Go faster.
I'm trying to help him.
Just jump.
Cmon. Cmon. Get in.
There you go.
Alright, you may wanna hop in.
Gardner, take your seat please.
There you go.
Come on.
- You know how to fly this, right?
- No.
Oh, no.
The pressure.
- I know, right?
No Gardner the oil pressure.
Alright. I've got them.
Looks like they're landing on the free way.
This will be a bit tricky
I usually have a landing strip.
Co ordinates, I need co ordinates.
Brakes, try it.
There is no brakes.
We are gonna have to jump.
Let's jump
Oh, no.
Holy crap.
Alright we gotta go. Come on.
No bodies.
What? Are you sure?
Positive. They fellas went to the wreckage.
They are alive, somewhere.
You had one job...
One job to protect Gardner.
To keep him making contact
with the outside world.
Preventing exactly this kind of eventuality.
You hanging this on me?
I admired you more than anyone.
We have been souldering
East Texas for you. For years..
What are you trying to say?
I am trying to say the whole mission
was your job, your responsibility.
You just gave up.
Where were you?
When is the BMW's gonna ready?
- Later.
Well, can you get the paperwork started?
Please... sir?
This is stealing.
- yeah, what ever.
It's wrong.
- How do you supposed to be find you father?
When you're right or wrong, seem to change
when you really need something
Is that a friend of yours?
- Where are we going?
- Anywhere off the grid.
Disabling the phone.
So Gardner, when you said
that you killed you mother
what exactly did you mean by that?
She died giving birth to me.
That does not mean that you have killed her.
So, Who is that guy?
- He founded East Texas. Where I am from.
I thought you said you're from New York.
- Who was the woman?
- Kendra? She's an astronaut.
- Who you are now from, Mars?
- Yeah.
Get out.
Get out.
I don't understand.
- I don't want to be played, Gardner.
That's what it is? Mars?
Some weird disease?
People have been liying to me
my entire life, which is...
Whatever cause people suck.
They suck they lie
and they use you to get what they want,
and then they just throw you away
And the thing is
I didn't even like Calculus.
Now it's just Mr. Halls always drunk
and nobody can understand what he said...
but he doesn't care
what we do on our computers
So that's what I look forword to,
to Calculus.
To talking to you. So get out.
Tulsa, I am not lying to you. My mother
was an astronaut. She made a mistake.
I was born on Mars.
Just because people have lied to you before,
I doesn't mean that I am lying now.
And just because something sounds
crazy to you,
Doesn't mean that it's not true
So if you really wanna get rid of me,
You have to get out
Because I'm gonna find my father
You know.. When people talk to me
that way, they get their ass kicked.
Try it. I am rocking this gravity.
Okay, Maybe you actually
believe it yourself.
- What?
- I am Sorry.
- For what?
- For people lying
for people sucking things.
I'm sorry you're angry.
- I am not angry.
Allow me?
- What are you doing?
Chivalry is not dead
at least not in Nantucket.
On a roadtrip with an insane.
What is...
It's just a horse.
We should not be doing this.
We need a device that's not being traced.
You wannna know where your father is, right?
Hey, it's unlocked. Consider
yourself luckey.
I consider myself a criminal.
There was a Sarah Elliot
who was an astronaut. Maybe that.
Says she died tragically from pressure
suit faliure shortly after arriving.
Well, I'm a secret.
- Of course you are. And I'm enigma
- Same person.
- I know, it's not working..
Damn it. We lost connection.
- Yeah, they are pretty cheap here.
Your best option is to save decoy isn't
piggybacking of the firewall installed.
Oh, cool, Thanks.
- Pay for my wrap and I won't tell.
No, we don't have money. Sorry.
- We do have money.
Why do not you say that louder?
- We have money.
Sorry, he doesn't speak sarcasm.
Here, take it.
My mother was wearing this when she died.
It's some sort of ring.
Looks like Half a ring.
Part of a bigger ring?
There's words on it. Let's see.
In Havasupai, Indian tribe in Arizona.
"Reunion of the halves. Love, eternity."
Yep, it's signed. Shaman Neka.
Gardener I think this is
some kind of wedding ring,
and he married them.
That's Shaman Neka.
Alright, How far is it Arizona?
Smile.
Oh no.
Oh, not smiling, running. Come on.
Let's go.
Two teenagers got here last night.
We think they are still in there.
Where is he?
- Sir you gotta.
- Hey.
- We got him.
Are you okay?
Talk to me.
What's going on?
You're right, Kendra. I gave up.
I withdrew. And the greater the pressure,
the emotion why I retreated.
As long as he was just a face on the screen,
I could almost handle it.
Sentencing a boy to a life
he never asked for.
But it's like the malignancy of any secret
It just kept getting worse.
Every time I go over it,
what I did, the choices I made,
I couldn't have done anything else.
but that's, that's not the point.
I dealt with the problem.
I just had no idea
what the solution would do to me.
It killed me,
and I say, it's still killing me.
I need to make this right.
Gardner's blood has
elevated levels ​​of troponin.
The news is not good Kendra.
Thank you.
Talk to me about troponin.
What?
- Elevated troponin in Gardner.
He's myosettic. Pool was depleted,
I've read the chart.
It's not necessarily a
problem on its own but
in conjunction with
elevated levels of troponin
He is suffering from an enlarged heart.
His heart can not
handle our atmosphere, our gravity.
He is running out of time.
Is that a balloon?
Tulsa, There is a balloon.
Tulsa, There is a balloon out there.
- Alright, alright.
- That's huge.
- Burgers and balloons.
- You really gotta slow down.
That's your fifth?
These taste so good.
Hey, Can you check in there,
see if there is any cash?.. Here?
Cowboys always stash away a few box
No, That's for your mouth.
Just gotta blown it.
No, you don't... Yeah, okay.
Nice. There you go.
You got a..
marks on your face.
Thanks.
Alright, go change. Relax,
this place is like a million stores
and like a trillion dollers.
Don't, there are cameras.
Alright. But look, this is the last of our money.
Go buy the clothes
then change.
break my heart,
break my hands
You can take anything
but my plans.
I have got big things to do.
You can laugh, I'll be
I'll be standing right here when you die
I got big things...
Is that your song?
- Maybe.
It's beautiful.
- Whatever.
What goes on in there?
I don't know.
Got a few sleeping bags. Ready?
Yeah.
And I am driving this time.
- In your dreams.
Excuse me, sir.
Play that again.
They are moving aimlessly.
Why New Mexico?
Both hands on the wheel,
both eyes on the road.
Dude, do you have a problem?
Cause you've definitely been looking at me
for the last four hours,
and it's starting to freak me out.
You are so Beautiful.
- And then you work that out just like that?
Yes, why wouldn't I?
Because you may wanna
just play it cool, you know.
Ease youself into the love game.
- But I do think you're beautiful.
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.
Okay. Just slow your roll, kid.
You are.. You gotta calm down.
- But I do not wanna calm down.
I don't understand why
this is making you so upset.
First of all, I'm not upset,
I am uncomfortable. There's a difference.
Secondly, people don't go around saying
what they feel whenever they feel it.
They have guards and shields
and other metaphors.
Why?
- Because we are all messed up and scared...
and try to be something we are not.
And if we all went around
just declaring our innermost desires
to the exact people we felt them for...
Then we will all end up happy, or something.
Look, Gardner...
I'm happy that you
think I am beautiful...and
.. kind of having
an amazing time with you.
But the last thing I'm gonna do
is actully tell you that.
You just did.
- You are blushing.
- I'm not.. not blushing.
Both hands on the wheel?
No.
What is happening?
Oh This is...
I believe the term is 'euphoria'.
I have an idea.
Hail in the southern desert
extending form Las
Close your eyes.
How did you just become
more beautiful in 20 seconds?
Do you want to kiss me?
Yeah, but I don't know how.
You will.
You don't understand.
On Mars, the people didn't do this.
We just had scientists
they studied ground samples.
Shut up, Gardner.
I thought about you everyday up there.
I know what's going to happen.
I'm gonna fall in love with you
and I'll fall to earth.
I'll be just like you.
- That a hook line.
Ok, I'll shut up now.
- No no.
Hold that thought.
To myself?
All my life I could not feel anything.
I couldn't feel water, I couldn't feel fire.
I could not feel wind on my face.
And now I can.
That's nothing compared to
what I feel with you.
I was so scared
I would not know how to be human.
You make me human, Tulsa.
That's incredible.
I know right?
- It has so many legs.
Everything's cool?
This is reservation property
The tourist lookout,
it's 15 miles that way.
Yeah, we know.
We're hopefully not intruding,
but we're looking for Shaman Neka.
When you know, you know.
Know what?
- I am not sure.
Come on.
I have married many couples.
There were no state records.
do you keep any?
I would keep her.
What was her name?
- Sarah Elliott.
So, I made this ring 16 years ago.
The other half of the ring
is with your father.
And this is the chart.
It doesn't say his name.
- No, she paid. That's her address.
Do you have that photo?
Mind if I borrow your computer?
Summerland, California.
I think this is it.
We found it.
Let's go.
You look like crap. You okay?
Do you know where we are going?
- Oh yeah.
Paris, Venice and Cairo.
Hello, Checking in?
Hi we just left the key is in the ignition.
Checking in.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Well, you wanted to see the world.
Here you have it.
It's..
It's like a big toy.
No, no no look.
That's Paris, New York, Shanghai.
And look, over there, Venice.
- Feels weird.
I mean... It's
It's not real.
It's not how I.. how I pictured it.
Hurting my heads to see it like this.
I'm sorry Gardner, but the world doesn't
always give you exactly what you want.
It gave to you.
- Alright, let me be cynical for one second.
Tulsa just because your parents are gone,
that does not mean you can't have a family.
We can be each other's family, because this
This isn't..
This is not real
but we can be real.
I think it's time to go.
Let's ski into California.
Did you hear me what I said?
Oh yeah, I did.
Gardner I think you are sick.
None of this is how it was in my head.
- You need to go to the hospital.
- Except you.
- You need to go to the hospital.
Something is wrong with you.
Gardner, Gardner...
You are okay, you're okay.
Please help.
I wannna scan him.
- What's his name?
- Gardner.
- What's his Last name?
- I don't know.
Where is he from?
I don't know.
Look at this.
- I've never seen it like it before.
- Oh My God. What is that?
His heart is grossly enlarged.
I gave him some valsartan, but...
Doesn't look good.
He was not lying.
Gardner
Gardner, I have to go.
Social Services are coming.
But I'm gonna go to Summerland.
I'll find your father
and tell him how amazing you are.
How much you think about him
and how badly you wanted to go there.
I promise.
We need to go.
- You can't you can't.
You have to stay here, Gardner
Do you even know why you're sick?
Because your heart's too big.
We have to go into Summerland.
- You can't. They are gonna help you.
There is nothing they can do.
They can't. Don't you see?
No matter how much I want earth,
the earth does not want me.
Wait a second. Get my bag.
hang on.
Social service.
- Thank God.
They used a credit card left in the car.
They are heading north to California.
I know where they're going.
Good evening.
I'm not dead.
you scared me.
You act like you hate
the world so much, Tulsa.
- Save your strength.
- It's all an act.
The beautiful music you make, gets you away.
Gardner. We are here.
Hey, We are here.
Can you help me?
- Yeah, Of course. Help you what?
Just to look better.
This is the best place I've been so far.
you ready?
He's gonna love it.
Can I help you?
Now would be a good time to say something.
Where did you get this photo?
East Texas.
- That is impossible.
My mother was Sarah Elliot.
She died giving birth to me.
Sarah Elliot died from pressure suit faliure
That's not. That's what they said, but...
You're my father.
- Is this some kind of scam?
- No no, he's not lying.
it's the truth. I swear.
I just wanted to meet you.
- Why are you doing this to me?
I'm not your father. I'm calling the police.
- Ok, just stay right here.
Stop being a dick.
He risked his life to leave the one place
he has ever know. All alone.
He didn't know anybody,
never set foot on this planet.
What do you want from me?
I could never do it. Just to meet you.
And he is dying.
I do not know who you are
or why you are doing this
I'm not his father.
Well then who are you? Because that is
you in the photo, and that is this house.
Yes, this is the house
our parents left it to us.
Sarah Elliot was my sister.
We gotta get some help,
please get some help.
Gardner
Gardner
Gardner
Gardner..
No, he's not your father.
he's not your father.
He's your uncle.
That does not matter anymore.
There is no time left Tulsa.
Let's just go back.
He's gonna call the ambulance.
My mother is here.
I can, I can feel her.
I didn't get to choose where I was born...
but I get to choose where I die.
- Tulsa.
- Yes, Gardner?
What's your favourite thing about earth?
You are, Gardner.
See you in the funny papers.
I WAS HERE
Gardner.
Kendra. Help me.
Turn him off.
Gardner. You can do it.
Gardner,
Gardner, Stay with me. Don't leave us.
Come on, come on.
What was she like?
My mother.
She was fearless
She was kind
And she just...
seemed so invincible.
And she'd make me wanna give up
living when she died.
You loved her.
You're my father.
Yes.
There they are.
- Hurry up. Hurry, there is no time.
- I knew I would find you.
- You are gonna be okay.
You are not alone.
Stay with me Gardner.
Hurry!
It's taking too long.
His blood pressure is dropping.
We have to get him out of our gravity.
You have to take the plane higher.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
You know I can't do that.
That's against our regulations.
I'm taking control.
What are you doing?
- Taking us into the stratosphere.
Excuse me?
- No worries. She can handle it.
Although I warn you,
one of you might need to take over.
One of us might...
- Yes, there's a chance that I may die.
But you have done this before?
- Yes all the time.
Virtually.
- Great.
Buckle up.
Alright let's buckle you in.
Yeah, just give it. Grab your thing.
I have the aircraft.
No, we gotta go higher.
Try and wake him up.
Gardner, wake up.
No, no.
No, no, no, no!
Stay in, stay in. I've got him.
You are on my planet?
- No.
Where are you, on yours?
No.
Will you ever gonna stop slapping me?
You have to go back.
- No, Tulsa, don't...
I hate it.
Look Gardner, we both know..
you have to go back.
I love you, Tulsa.
And I love you.
How is he doing?
- Stable, for now.
This will buy us the time we need.
- And you? You okay?
Apparently.
This is good to know.
I am gonna miss you Gardner.
More than anything else in the world.
Me too.
You're the best mom I never had.
Safe travels ok?
Wait a minute, hold up
- Hey.
Nice ride.
You gonna be okay?
You're amazing.
But the last thing I'm gonna gonna do is
actually tell you that.
You just did.
T minus ten, nine, eight...
seven, six, five, four...
three, two, one, zero.
Ignition. Let's go.
Same time tomorrow?
Marks for me.
Tulsa, you have a visitor.
Hi.
Gotta go.
As you probably know,
I have retired from NASA.
Well, not really. I am running their
training program now.
And it's been great.
I mean getting re accustomed
to living on this planet has been a little trying.
Anyway, I am getting off track.
Since I could not spend any money on Mars,
and I was up there for six years...
It turns out I actually have a lot of it.
So I bought a ranch house
in Boulder, Colorado.
I like to ski and
the people are really nice.
Yeah it's a pretty big house.
Gets lonely at times.
Would you like to come live with me there?
Are you getting paid? To take me?
Oh, God, no.
Because I age out in a month.
Who said anything about only a month?
I wanted to go to Earth.
Not just to visit, but to live there.
Turns out people from Earth wanted
exactly the same thing as people from Mars.
And I should know, because I'm pretty sure
I'm the only one. So far.
I don't know, which is better
But here is what I do know
It's good to be home.
