FAMILY IS FAMILY
Tell us about your influences.
I'd say, mainly ourselves.
I do the drawing,
Constance conceptualizes.
Our motivation has always been
the quest for the almost-nothing.
Put very simply.
We imagined, desired
a 21st-century human
entering his home and finding
the fullest meaning of emptiness.
- The "fullest meaning of emptiness".
- Right.
The luxury of empty space.
The comfort of nothingness.
That's a good definition, Constance dear.
"The comfort of nothingness."
Wonderful, love.
If you don't mind,
here at the Palais de Tokyo,
where your retrospective opens tonight,
could we speak of Valentin D's
difficult childhood?
We said no personal questions.
Our show generally features
our guest's private side.
His private side remains private.
Let it go, love. I'm listening.
We don't know much about your boyhood.
You don't know much
because there's not much to say.
My mother was desperate
and gave her baby up to an orphanage,
promising to come back for me.
Unfortunately, I'm still waiting.
- How did you find out...
- ls this an interrogation?
I'm the only family Valentin has now.
Louloute!
Just a minute, Gus.

Nah, the shoot shkarunk?

3 warshes?
You warshed my shoot 3 times?
In the machine, on delicate,
cold water,
then medium delicate.
Then I cranked it up
to extra hot water.
But I couldn't set it to delicate then.
Extra hot?
Louloute,
what does that shay?
Dree cleonag.
As in, French cleaners.
You can't put it
in the machine, Louloute.
You bring it in to have it cleaned dry.
Dry?
How do they warsh
with no water, jush air?
Not with air!
Then what? If it ain't water, ain't air,
what ish it?
"Dry" in English, means no water.
- They use dry liquid.
- Dry liquid?
- Dry liquid?
- Yep.

At 80 years old.

YOu!

Lishen up, fatsho.
Don't you teach me to count.
I got me two shons!
And I got two forever more!
And nobody living

my 80th birthday with my 2 yungins.
That'sh today?
Like I shaid, he can't count!
Shorry, I forgot your 80th birthday.
Prob'ly cause I don't look my age.
Drive, Gus!
What about dinner?
You a grown-up, ain't ya?
You a grown-up?
Hang on, bi/oute! Add these in.
They're all the same!
Looky! It's got my Tintin on the cover!
Whatcha doin', Suzanne?
Nothing. Like Britney.
I'm coloring.
No, don't do that Ma.
She loves you now.
I think she's fixing your birthday meal.
Well now...
Card declined.
Really?
All right, I'll pay.
No, Ma!
Sure! Plus, I'm getting Paris Match
for my shewing club friends.
But not this one!
Somebody drew on it!
She's elderly...
He's not shaying he's an orphan anymore?
No, of course not.
- Whatcha lookin for?
- What he shays about me.
Now that he remembers he got a ma.
Dang, my glashes.
Poupoutche, read to Gramma.
"The famous designer has a muse..."
Why's he amused?
No, Gramma. "A muse."
I heard. But I shay more work,
less amusement!
Mom's gonna read to Grammy.
Britney can't read good yet.
Really? But...
Button it!
As one of the world's leading designers,
what'sh your inshpiration?
My firsh inshpiration is my mother.
How shweet!
I made my firsh pictures for her.
She is...
so dishtinguished...
True. All hish firsh drawings
were for me.
My little biloute.
- They grow up too fash, right?
- Yup, yup-
Anything about the birthday?
Sure. He shpeaks of your ma's 80th
in Paris Match.
Huh?
Well...
Read it!
Yeah, right there he shays
he's throwing her a 80th birthday party,
with his partner Constance,
who can't wait to meet her.
That woman's a phony.
How come I ain't on the cover with him,
inshtead of that shity shlicker.
Muse?
Being reduced to the role of muse!
Who cares? Great pictures...
Dad, I'm a licensed architect.
Valentin and I collaborate.
He's not my muse.
- Our friends don't read Paris Match.
- Unless we're in it.
You and your muse.
I'm fine.
You put too many tracks in here.
Well that's the concept.
Getting smashed in the face?
This place is a hit
because it's so trendy and original.
It's a money maker.
Which reminds me, Sofitel's top brass
is coming tonight
to the opening. Treat them right.
Our proposal will do.
Tight deadline.
Love, if you want,
we can pull our bid.
What? I'm not running a charity.
Global project, several million euros.
World-wide exposure.
Come on.
Let's toast this Sofitel contract...
and the next!
- Champagne!
- Sake!
Sake, right.
We better go.
We have to be crosstown in 10 minutes.
- What's the client's name again?
- De Clery.
- Madame de Clery, how are you?
- Awful!
Glad to see you again.
I wish I could say the same.
What is it?
A problem with the furniture!
I can't accept the work as is, sorry.
- Excuse me?
- Why is that?
The sofa is very stiff.
It's perfect.
Aerial, linear. lt fits perfectly
with your relaxation space.
Relaxation space?
Last night, watching TV,
I pinched my sciatic nerve.
Perhaps you were just in a bad position?
A bad position, you can say that again!
To be clear, it looks great.
but it's not comfortable!
Those 3-legged chairs. Really,
you need life insurance.
Nobody could sit on one
without falling over!
That tripod asymmetric chair
won the 2016 Design Award.
I give it the 2018 Pratfall Award!
That's all I can say.
Young man, come sit down
on your boss' 2016 Award.
I'm unable to.
There you are. What did I say?
Get up!
Jean-Luc, show Mme de Clery
how to sit on the tripod.
There you are.
And boom!
Is this intentional?
All right, I'll do it.
Let's get on with this.
There. It's not complicated.
Just a matter of habit.
And elegance.
Have your furniture tested!
Before selling it for a fortune.
We're very sorry.
We'll get a new proposal to you soon.
I could've had my in-law,
Philippe Starck, do it.
Philippe who?
Be happy I don't send you
my chiropractor's bill!
Excuse me.
- What's his name?
- Kad Merad.
Right. And Julia.
We can't stay, but really,
it's magnificent. Bravo.
You've seen the show already?
Paparazzi. That's all we needed.
Couple of the year, big night!
Come on, a little comment!
- Hello and welcome.
- What the...
Oh, sorry sir.
How are you tonight?
Paul, my chiropractor.
Nice to meet you.
I have six of those.
- And the table.
- The Monolith.
One and only.
Enjoy the show.
- Excuse us.
- Of course.
Come meet Kate Fisher,
the CEO of Accor Europe.
Bravo!
A genius and his muse!
The retrospective
is marvelous. Very inspirant.
Kate was sort of hinting
that the Sofitel account...
I can't say a word
before all the proposals are in.
But from you to me,
you're more than favorites.
My brother.
- What's he want?
- I don't know.
Turn your phone off.
Maybe he has no signal.
Shir, ya come inshide with me.
My shon will shay I'm hish ma for real.
You need an invitation.
Ifl get an invitation,
it wouldn't be a shrurprise no more!
You get me?
No invitation, I can't let you in.
Forget it!
He's a boubourse!
We shtepped out a shec for a shmoke
and thish door went shlammin.
What?
We stepped out for a smoke
and the door slammed.
Go ahead.
Thish plaish ish purdy!
And sho big.
Go tell your ma the truth.
Now!
Howdy, howdy.
My Valentin ish sho shweet.
He invited too many people!
Thish ish shameful. Go.
Wait a while.
She's shaying hi.
Thanksh for coming

You're very welcome.
Happy birthday.
Oh, a present!
Thank you! I'm much obliged!
Thank you!
Ya shouldn't have.
I can't kish everybody!
And no one's here from down home!
Suzanne.
There ish nobody

Odette!
There'sh Odette from my shewing club!
That'sh not her.
Odette, how y'all been?
Don't jush shtand there!
My name isn't Odette. I don't know you.
You got a shwollen head!
Ever shince you got to Parish?
Shkow-off!
Let me hold your gifts.
- Looky, looky...
- What?
Well.
Not very thoughtful!
They all buy the shame gift.
I'm telling Valentin.

No, sorry.

Not yet.
Pascal!
Thanks!
You're welcome!
Sho pretty!
The Minister of Culture.
Madam Minister, a pleasure!
Valentin D., Mrs. Brandt, bravo.
A stunning retrospective!
French savoir-faire in full flower!
Mommy!
It's OK, I sympathize.
Being an orphan is a deep wound.
Mom! Mom is here!
Yes, little one. Mom's right here.
This is too much.
Tintin!
What's that?
Yoo-hoo, Tintin!
Who let those hillbillies in?
What's my big lump doing?
Calm down, calm down.
How? I'm an orphan and my mom is here!
Breathe. We're fine.
What the hell is going on?
She's with the Minister of Culture.
My career is over. Call security.
No, she is your mother.
Whose mother?
- We have to exfiltrate them.
- How?
- Exfiltrate who?
- His family.
Family? He's an orphan.
- Not totally.
- Either you're an orphan or not!
Dad you're no help.
You handle the Minister,
we'll explain later.
You better!
Listen love,
go wait for me in the car.
I'll deftly remove them
from the Palais de Tokyo.
Tintin,
my little bi/oute.
Thish ish it. I'm here.
Hello, Mom.
Poor guy.
He sees his mother in everyone.
Five minutes ago, it was me.
Hello.
Constance Brandt.
Not as shtuck up
as she looksh in pictures.
- Nice compliment.
- Sure thing.
I don't mind shaying,
sheeing as you got no yungins,
it'sh much too big here.
No, this isn't our house.
Sho why are we here?
Mom's got Alzheimer's.
Her dream ish to have her 80th birthday
with her 2 shons,
before forgetting everything.
- Let's go home.
- Home?
More private, to celebrate her birthday.
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.
He took it well.
What's he doing?
God. Lucky the neighbors are asleep.
What a nightmare!
Why our place?
You don't want to see them.
My mom is very ill. Alzheimer's.
Oh love, I'm very sorry.
We'll have a little birthday dinner,
then they go back north.
Nothing to eat. Olga's gone home.
We'll eat what's in the fridge.
She'll forget anyway.
Sorry to saddle you with this.
They are your family.
Even if they are weirdos.
Wait till you meet my dad.
Come in.
Great sheein ya barak, bi/oute!
Welcome.

Very strange.
Stinks of gasoline. Right?
Yes.
The vegetables!
We brought organic prodoosh
from the farm!
Here you are!
Thank you so much.
Should I rinse them?
Cooking gets the shmell out.
Shome of it.
Nothing's ready!
Olga, the table's not set!
I have a message. From Olga.
Well?
She fell down a flight of stairs.
Broke both her legs!
- Poor thing.
- Both?
Yes. How awful. She must be in pain.
Horrible.
We'll have to manage without her.
- How embarrassing.
- Be right back.
Go ahead and have a seat.
We have no cake.
There's one in the fridge!
Shit! It's partly eaten.
Let me see.
What are you doing?
An "M" for "Mom".
You're a genius.
It's perfect.
No candles.
Matches.
Hey Louloute!
It's pufdY-
Shame picture as back at the trailer.
On the chocolate box.
- You can't compare that.
- Right.
They don't got the chocolate.
My shoot is sho tight!
I'm tuckered out.
I'm all right!
- You OK?
- Fine!
Sure you ain't hurt?
It's thish mesh here.
Shtrange.
That king of desoggen

"Design," not "desoggen"!
Happy birfhday to you...
Go ahead, Ma. Blow!
That cake's been used.
No, look. "M" for Mom.
Or the "W" for Wow!
- Blow, Grandma!
- Blow, Suzette.
Suzanne!
Suzanne, sorry.
Well done!
Make a wish!
My wish
is that my Tintin,
and that other one,
got me a purdy gift.
What?
You did get me a preshent,
for my 80th birthday?
Sure.
But Olga put it away...
Thish chkarade is over.
What charade?
I'm nobody's boubourse!
"Boubourse"?
Idiot.
What?
A half-eaten cake,
two dinner candles,
nothing for dinner!
- We explained.
- Enough.
Not a shingle picture of me
in this cold housh!
Cause it's been a long time.
We'll take shome pictures.
Tell her the truth now.
It's my fault, I lied.
I told ma you invited us.
Otherwise you wouldn't shee me.
We need 10,000 euro.
5,000.
8, or we lose everything.
You use her, and she has Alzheimer's?
Who has Alzheimer's?
You do, Ma. But you forgot.
What nonshense!
Enough! Gus, shtop lying!
8,000, please. It's nothing to you.
Disgusting! You brought her down,
lied, to get money out of me?!
6,000?
Screw you! Nothing!
Valentin...
All right.
- Let'sh leave!
- Mom!
I'm getting on home now!
Wait.
You can sleep over.
It's the middle of the night.
We'll make it up to you tomorrow.
No, thanks.
I always fought hard for my kids.
Sho's they'd have it better than I did.
You can get rich,
but you better never forget
where you come from.
And you done forgot who you are!
That'sh awful shad!
- Let me explain.
- Let me tell you.
I dreamed about seeing you again,
a thousand times over the years.
Turns out it'sh a nightmare.
I shee you again,
but I don't recognize you!
That's worsh than anything!
You can't imagine how cruel
my world can be.
I hurt you, but I couldn't make it
without that lie.
Who shaid you made it?
Well, come on...
Maybe I lied, but you weren't sho stingy
when you had nothing.
All the way to Paris
to spout that bullshit!
One day you deshided to be an orphan.
Well tonight,
I accept that I losht a child.
Farewell.
Mom!
You all right?
We live in different worlds.
She can't understand.
She can't accept it.
That's right. Exactly right.
- Seeing them upset you.
- Especially like this!
Now I see why I ran away 25 years ago.
It's over now. They're gone.
Were you with Valentin D?
Do you know Valentin D?
I 'm the orphan's brother.
She's his mother.
He's a Ch'ti and he's ashamed of ush.
He is Valentin Duquenne!
You do mean Valentin D,
the famous designer, an orphan?
If he's an orphan, I'm a prima baralina!
Ballerina, not baralina.
He undershtood.
You don't got to correct me on camera!
Stop!
Stop it!
You have no broadcast authorization!
We outed you, you hick!
Give me that!
Valentin! I'm calling Dad,
he'll take care of it.
That bastard.
Nicely done!
Hi, Dad?
The paparazzi was tall, dark?
With a beard?
- Overgrown teenager?
- How did you know?
I know him.
He'll sell to the highest bidder. Us.
We'll just go pay him a visit.
No, Alexander.
We need to get in front of this.
I'll call my publicist.
What?
We'll lose the Sofitel account.
Why? My talent is the same.
Lots of people lie about their past.
Wait till we sign.
Then you can announce what you want!
There'll be another reason to lie.
I've hurt my family enough as it is.
We're your family. Let me handle this.
Valentin, stop.
Valentin, goddammit!
Don't screw this up! Hang up!
Oh shit!
Hang UP!
Shit!
Help!
HGTEL-DIEU HOSPITAL
Where is my shon?
In the O.R. Severe concussion.
- Emergency surgery.
- It can't be!
What happened?
I don't know. I found him in the street,
unconscious.
The police think he got run over
by a hit-and-run driver.
Bastard! That's Paris for ya!
Don't worry, darling.
Dr. Rosenberg is operating on him.
- The Doc whose house we remodeled?
- Yes, that's him.
Goodness.
Dr. Rosenberg, how is he?
Hi, Constance.
I can't tell you anything yet.
He's still in the O.R.
Then why are you here?
I couldn't go on.
I'm suffering from sciatica.
I couldn't concentrate.
We induced a coma,
in order to reduce pressure
from the hemorrhage
in his cranium.
He had a cerebral hemorrhage?
My Tintin is in a coma?
The last time I spoke to him
I told him he was no longer
my shon!
It's all right.
He knew you didn't mean it.
Anyway, he'll pull through.
Right?
If you're asking if he'll survive, yes.
But he will have extensive damage.
- Partial or total amnesia.
- Good!
Yeah, no, I mean that he's not dead.
If it's just amnesia, good.
- He can live with that.
- Can we see him?
Constance, go home and rest.
I still have your cell.
We got to find a hotel,
not too expenshive.
No, come stay at our house.
We don't want to dishturb anybody.
This is a difficult moment.
We should stick together.
As a family.
Thank you Dad, for being there
to take care of my Valentin.
I'm lucky to have you.
Run Over By Hit-And-Run Driver
Valentin D.,
In Critical Condition
- Get any sleep?
- Not grammint.
Not a lot.
Me neither.
We should have some coffee.

Don't bother yourshelf,

All right.
The cups...
- Jush moved in?
- No, why?
Funny.
- Sheems like this isn't your barak.
- No, I...
I'm rarely in the kitchen.
Olga does it all. She's great.
She's late today.
She broke both legs, right?
Really?
I remember now.
Both legs, poor thing.
Terrible.
Sorry I'm late.
My subway line stopped
for over an hour.
I thought it was wildcat strike.
Luckily, it was only a suicide.
Oh good.
Hello, ma'am. I'm Olga.
Suzanne, Valentin's mother.
Valentin? The Valentin.
That'sh right.
He ain't an orphan no more.
I reshushitated.
- Bedrooms?
- Please, yes.
Her legs look better.
Polishka bones are shtrong!
Sure is a lar's barak here.
Lies!
Sorry, Suzanne. It's true...
Valentin and I were terrible hosts.
Awful.
You may not believe me,
but I'm glad to finally meet you.
Shame here.
Constance, I got to know,
did my Valentin talk to you about me,
all these years?
I wish I could say yes.
That's all right. It's what I thought.
The hospital.
Yes, Doctor?
That's wonderful.
- He's awake, talking.
- Oh my God!
Thank you, Doctor!
A miracle! Praise the lord.
Hi, I'm Dr. Legard.
I finished the operation.
- Dr. Rosenberg isn't here?
- No, he's laid up. Sciatica.
Can we see Valentin?
But not all at once.
Perhaps his mom first,
then the others?
- All right?
- Sure.
Your son is confused.
Normal, 48 hours after trauma.
You mustn't upset him.
My Tintin!
Mama!
Goodnesh, I'm glad to shee ya!
What'sh wrong with me?
I'm weak as sheven days.
He can't speak normally yet,
but don't worry.
You don't shpeak normal!
With that Parish accent there!
Shity shlicker!
Oh I see.
Well then, I'll send the others in.
Who'sh he?
A doctor. He shaved your life.
And apparently it's a miracle.
Got your head shcrewed back on right!
Right, I remember.
Ma, what did you do to your hair?
Why's it white as shnow?
That's your fault.
Every time I worry,
bang, another white hair.
- Goodnesh! That's a lot of worry!
- Sure is.
You know, that accident of yours
shcared ush shilly.
I know. Shorry about my scooter.
What scooter?
My scooter!
That doesn't exist anymore.
I'll fix it. Dad will lend me tools,
I'll fix it up myshelf!
Whatcha on about, bi/oute?
My scooter accident,
when I hit my head.
That accident was 25 years ago!
25 years ago?
- I've been in the hospital 25 years?
- No, not 25 years in the hospital.
This isn't a hospital?
Yes, it's a hospital.
But you ain't been here 25 years.
Hey there, you're all mixed up!
Sho where'sh my scooter?
I don't know.
In the dump maybe.
No! Your pajunked it.
Tintin,

Whatsha matter?
My scooter!
Why did Pa do that?
You can't be shobbing

I losh my scooter!
I'll buy you a new one.
Thanks, Ma!
Hi there!

Let's let him rest.
Come to my office.
Louloute, why did you marry my brother?
That was long ago.
Because you love me! Why "long ago"?
Yeah, I don't know.
Because I love him. That'sh right.
What?
You told me you two just "flirted"

Yeah, right.
Quit your nonshenshe.
It's ancient hishtory, Gus.
How long did you shneak around?
Can't remember.
The truth, Louloute.
From 6th grade,
to senior year, about.
Did you sleep together?
Not in 6th grade anyway!
Louloute.
After 10th grade.
How many times?
Quit it, we were kids.
He left me and went to Paris,
I fell in love with you.
You're the one I love, Gus.
Shweetheart!
Shweetheart?
This subdural area
was affected by the hematoma.
It's clear that the cranial trauma
has severe repercussions.
Good!
He's very confused.
He mixed me up with his wife.
Wonder why?
This kind of trauma often provokes
memorial or sensory distortion.
Valentin now has severe
spatiotemporal confusion.
Like in Shtar Trek?
Stop it!
Please!
Enough.
Today, he came out of his coma
the age of his scooter crash.
He was 17, and he had no helmet on.
How can it be?
Forgetting or recalling years
is common.
Does it last long?
When will he be normal again?
Why? He's better like this.
He'sh normal.
With that accent?
He losht hish accent!
- Help me find the real Valentin.
- Thish is the real him.
Be attentive, help him piece together
who he's become over 25 years.
He has 2 months to recover
and progress as much as possible.
- Then he'll remain that way forever.
- No!
What'sh thish?
Let'sh get back to eu/ barak!
What did he say?
He wansha git back northerly.
Thish ish your barak.
This is where you live.
Your home is this.
Thish.
Thish.
El “brack, " here.
Eu/ barak.
There...
Recognize it?
Hi, Uncle!
Who are you?
My name's Britney.
She's your niece, my daughter.
Who I had with my wife Louloute.
I think.
- What you doing?
- Little pick-me-up.
Stop! No.
What? Just one!
Only you can break the rules?
I went out with him before us.
Huh? You went out with who?
With nobody, Tintin!
You lied! That's the rule you broke!
To get home before nightfall,
we better hurry.
All right, Ma. Let'sh go!
Thanksh a lot. Bye now.
No. You stay here, love.
"Love"! I shwear I don't know her!
She'sh your wife. Thish is your barak.
I'm not sleeping here.
I want to go back north, Ma.
- We ain't taking Don Juan north.
- Gus!
Tintin, shweetie. Listen.
We'd love to take you back home,
but we can't.
The doctor shaid you gotta recall
your new life from before.
I can't undershtand...
What kind of nonshenshe is thish?
What if you stayed a few more days?
That could ease the transition, for him.
And for me.
Yeah! I love it here!
I don't mind, if it's helpful.
We could shtick around a bit!
What did we shay?
That we're shtaying! You're happy!
Thanksh!
What'sh thish?
Asparagus salad with spirulina.
Your favorite.
My favorites are fricadelle,
chicory au gratin, carbonade...
Right. Ma?
Yeah, Tintin.
But I guesh you like thish now.
Thish caye/le sure hurtsh my ash.
Got that right.
- What?
- The chair hurts his butt.
Don't bellyache.
You designed these cayel/es.
Even if my ash hurtsh,
I'm glad we got
the whole family together.
How come Pa's not here?
Too much work in thejunkyard. Huh?
Right. Your father worksh too hard.
- He knows I almost died?
- Yes, but anyway...
He said he's done with you,
he's only got one son now, because...
you're an ashwipe.
That fatsho
has never exactly been a poet.
How are you, fatsho?
Getting by alone?
Shtarving to death?
No prob/em!
I'm better on my own.
That's good, because...
- I'm not coming home yet.
- Huh?
What, huh?
You gotta get home!
Your shon had an accident.
- Gus?
- No.
Valentin.
Who's that?
Oh stop.
He's better now.
I'll call you back
when you're cheerier.
Gotta go, I don't like cold food.
Whatcha make for shupper?
I made fish waterzooi 
With a maroi/les f/amiche.
Can't get over it!
Enjoy!
You too.
- How is he?
- It's horrible, Dad.
He has amnesia.
The mind of a 17-year-old.
That's wonderful!
That's a creative, carefree age.
It's good for business.
I can't stand it. I'm lost.
I don't understand this.
He's no longer my Valentin.
When he talks...
When he talks, it's...
I can't. I won't make it.
I'm teetering on burnout.
Pull it together, honey.
It's OK.
You'll fight it, like I taught you.
- Not possible.
- Sure it is.
Done! She's asleep.
- Wait, Louloute.
- No!
Louloute, Why'd you leave me?
Thish is no good.
You left me and went to Paris.
- 25 years ago!
- Why'd I do that?
Findersh keepersh!
Shut ya pie hole!
Don't shtart brawling!
It'sh not me. It's Gus...
It's both of you!
"It'sh not me,"
the innoshent momma'sh boy,
"l'm gonna shtudy in Paris."
Shekut ya trap I shaid!
Why's he talking that way?
- N: Ch'ti.
- Shitty?
Ch'ti.
- She ain't ya poochka!
- No, she'sh my wife!
He can't talk to Sofitel like that!
Sofitel is all you think about!
Good thing I shtopped drinking.
I'd ruffle your feathers.
He needs re-education.
Speech, walking, posture. Look!
I know, but look how stupid he is!
I can't believe I said that.
I'll push the meeting back.
You take care of him. I'll call you.
It will be fine.
- Got to go now.
- Dad!
- You stink of alcohol!
- You saying I drink?
Come closer.
Look.
That'sh ush.
See those chairs?
You designed them.
You, with our "Monolith" table,
which made us world famous.
That's us, when we met
at the Milan Design Week.
Love at first sight.
You wanted to duck the crowds,
so you took me to the opera. Carmen.
We kissed near the Duomo,
and here we are.
- You remember?
- Sure.
And now your rinshing days are gone,
Ajax Shpray 'n Wipe, no need to shcrub!
Ajax will free you
from your shink and tub!
AfaX Shpray 'n Wipe!
I remember that Ajax commercial.
Huh? I'm getting my memory back.
Not the right one.
Let's turn in. Big day tomorrow.
All right.
Where's my bedroom?
Here. This is your bedroom.
Where's my bed?
We live together.
So we sleep in the same...
- Bed?
- Yes.
Good night, ma'am.
And stop calling me "ma'am,"
I beg you.
Good night, Miss.
You shick, Gus? You want to puke?
I want you.
I'm in no mood. I got a headache.
You turning your back ash on me?
Good night, Gus.
You shtill love him.
That's why you don't want me?
Shtop, you know you're the one I ker.
You shtill love him.
Then make love to me.
With your blood alcohol over 2,
you get a big hug.
That'sh it.
Come here, big baby.
What'sh that?
...he forgot it all.
- Good morning.
- Hello, Valentin.
I don't recall ya.
Naturally.
This is the first time we meet.
That's why I didn't know your push.
"That's the reason
I hadn't recognized your face."
Your father-in-law sent me.
I'm a speech therapist.
I'm here to help you
lose that ugly accent.
I got no acchent.
You're the one who tokes fanshy.
It's not "toke" but "talk".
Jaw slightly open.
Try "A" as in rabbit.
RO-bit?
Rabbit.
Ro-bit.
Like a ro-bit.
Let's take it slowly.
Repeat after me.
A, E, I, O, U.
O, O, E, O, O.
Let's use illustrations.
What is this?
A ro-bit.
A hare.
A hay.
- Good.
- No, "re".
- A hay.
_ "Reu-
Fine.
- A dowug.
- No, a dog.
Dowug.
A g'va.
That'sh a g'va.
A horse.
Or a g'va.
Shampoo.
Suntan lotion.
Sure, but up north...
Bowl.
Right, a ball.
- Shkoosh.
- Right, shoes.
We're progressing.
That's important.
Boxersh.
Boxersh.
- A cayelle.
- Right!
- A shackle.
- Well...
We'll see later.
- A caréte.
- Right!
Shcooter...
Move on.
A tabe.
Bull.
I ain't lying. It's a tabe. Look.
Shmart phone.
- A shmart phone.
- Right!
A smart phone!
25 years ago, there weren't any.
That means his memory is there.
A 900d Sign, right?
He says "shmart " instead of "smart".
He only uses two vowels, "e" and "o".
That makes it hard to communicate.
His memory is altered, but not erased!
That's good, right?
But will he be ready in 1O days
as your father demands?
I doubt it.
Hi there, shweeties!
Shleep OK, biloute?
He's not the only patient?
No, but they're not urgent.
Give your ma a kish.
Nash to shee ya like that.
Purdy picture.
A shon and his ma.
My God, he'll never be ready.
Feels good to be together
after sho long!
Feels sho good!
I love ya, I ker ya.
What's thish? You crazy?
- Goodnesh!
- Gustave! Valentin! Stop!
Have you both losht your minds?
Wait. You can'tjush leave.
Yesh I can.
I'm sick of both of you.
Did I raise you like that?
To be fighting!
But it's OK.
We made up, Gus and me.
Right, Gus?
Shpeak for yourshelf!
Some birthday!
I can't take this!
You make me regret I had kids.
Ma...
Shut your trap, wait in the caréte.
Wait, Ma.
What about the money?
Borrow money from your lover?
I'd rather die!
That'sh what we're in for.
Quiet, get in the caréte.
Don't talk to me like your ma!
WhY are you arguing?
Who asked you?
Since I was little,
I meant to return your box of crayons.
You forgot them when you left.
I used them a little, but not too much.
Thank you.
- What?
- Britney's not here.
We forgot her.
I don't believe thish!
Britney!
M'ma jush got...
I don't understand.
It'sh all right.
Is there a Tony here?
- That's me.
- You're from up north?
After working so hard to lose my accent!
But listen, I don't want to learn.
I want to understand.
To undershtand, ya gotta learn.
That'sh a good shtart!
Let's start with the basics.
"A" is pronounced "o".
I got that.
There is no "must" or "have to".
We say, "l besh be gone."
And no conjugation?
No. And we have one tense.
Got it.
Shee-ut, I done got mucksh
on my shkoosh.
Great.
What we gonna ker about mucksh?
Right, so...
I have to go...
I besh go? Be went?
Be gone.
Not sure...
To ker...
- That's "l0ve" too?
- Right, and "look for".
"Ker" is a generic word.
It means everything.
- Very few words.
- Right.
No conjugation.
No need.
To ker...
the tarshkang?
No, the warshing.
Warshing, it'sh American.
Shimple!
It really hurts.
Sit up straight.
Close your mouth.
Naturally.
Yes.
Look intelligent, I don't know.
If possible...
Now, the salad.
No, sit up straight.
Close your mouth.
There.
Please.
Let's concentrate.
- Watch me.
- Sorry.
Sit straight, mouth closed,
and salad.
Straight, mouth, salad.
No, never cut lettuce.
Fold it.
You shed fold it.
You fold it with your utensils.
All right, fine.
Fine.
A little sip.
Delicately. Very good.
The finger.
Right, very nice.
Very good.
Stop laughing.
You're encouraging him to act up!
Better laugh than shob! Huh, bi/oute?
Better laugh than shob!
She talks Ch'ti!
Who done learned ya Ch'ti?
You learn city slicker, I learn Ch'ti.
"What'sh good for the goosh!"
Enough. Class over for today.
Valentin, stop.
Purdy!
Hi, I'm Valentin.
Hi, there!
Hi, I'm Valentin.
- Léonard.
- Valentin.
Constance, say hello!
They know our names.
They're our employees.
We can still say hello.
Thish is my offish?
Yes, all yours.
Ours.
We're back up and running!
The sofa for the Sofitel lobbies,
from your sketches.
The fabric samples?
Doesn't look comfortable!
We need arm resh!
And cushions!
Put cushions all around
so it'sh nice and...
comfortable all around.
Yes, there you are.
I know you, you're local.
”/ sheen ya round these parish!"
I sheen ya round these partsh!
No! Why pucker up?
Goodness, looks like rain!
"Goodnesh, gonna drash!"
So 119W-
Goodnesh, it'sh drashin.
Put ya shlicker on.
Goodness, you're complete/y drunk.
”You ain'tjush been shucking ice cubes!"
I may very well slap you.
“I'll sh/ap ya shi/ly!"
Close your mouth,
you'll swallow your nose.
I know this.
Shkut ya trap, you'll eat ya nosh.
Why'sh it sho ker?
Show care?
The cosht. lt'sh ker!
The cost!
That's with the usual margin.
A 5 or 1O per shent mark-up
over cosht is plenty.
That slashes the price.
Cusht0mer's happy.
We shell more furniture, huh?
Well?
Well, it's...
It's more daring.
But very interesting.
All my friends are terribly jealous!
And so I...
This large decorative block
in the middle of the dining room is...
- Very Bauhaus, right?
- Very.
It does take a lot of room.
A classic from our collection.
The "Monolith" table.
Right, it's a table. Silly me.
So I was wondering,
how does one position one's legs
when seated around the table?
Right.
Shee-ut!
Where does she put her gams?
Valentin!
On the side,
using our Amazon chairs.
Like so.
Yeah, or be a double amputee.
What is it?
I had a flash.
What?
My graduation,
from Boule design school.
That means your memory's coming back.
What? Tell me.
I shee faces, my drawings.
The apprehension, the emotion...
The best day of my life.
What?
I thought it was the day we met.
But you don't remember.
Sorry.
You can't remember a thing?
Well? Remember?
TW again.
Still nothing?
I love this exercise.
- What are you looking for?
- I losht a shoe.
Who cares?
I guess.
- Wasn't it a little fast?
- Yes.
Sorry.
It was great. Like the first time.
For me it was the first time.
What?
- Nothing.
- Stop, Valentin.
Don't lie. That just makes it worse.
I cheated on Louloute.
Valentin!
- Sorry.
- You can't!
Yes, I know. I'm sorry.
I can't remember how we were
but I want to. lwill. I must.
I hope so. We sheem happy.
Where are you going? I want you.
- No.
- Oh yesh.
It'sh not me ya want.
lt'sh Louloute.
- No, I shwear.
- No way.
I'll prove it!
Who's on your mind?
YOu!
- Who'sh me?
- Conshtansh!
No!
You'll never get it.
I fixed it, but he slashed our prices.
We must stop him.
If it were up to me,
he'd be in a trusteeship.
If he signs you're majority owner,
with the name Valentin D.
But I doubt he'll do it.
He's dumber than a fence post.
He'll sign anything!
Good. We're close to the edge.
Not a word to my daughter.
How about that?
Here's the big dummy now!
How's the Chitty going? The Chippy.
Sign this,
for the company future.
Who'sh he?
He's... our attorney.
No. I'm his attorney.
One lawyer's enough.
We trust each other.
Why pay twice for the same thing?
Say thanks, I'm saving you money.
Thanksh.
What? Something wrong?
All thish legaleesh,
I don't undershtand.
Where do I shign?
Right there.
There. That all?
That's quite enough for today.
Oh yes.
Enjoy your lunch.
Where were you?
We have the Vassili Belkov opening.
Zip me up, please.
Sorry, I get upset over nothing.
You couldn't recall.
Sorry. Now and then,
I fall into familiar patterns.
We were... very punctual.
Go change, bi/oute.
Or we'll be 2 hours late.
Ya shoot ish on the bed.
Go ahead.
Constance, I must tell you.
Dad said Sofitel is coming.
Kate Fisher heard about your memory.
She's worried, but who cares?
If they don't pick us, it's their loss.
Babache them!
Kate's not here yet.
Better if he stays quiet. Rumors.
My couple-of-the-year! Nice surprise!
Thanks for coming.
Wouldn't miss it for the world.
Valentin, how are you?
He can't talk. He has laryngitis. Right?
Oh! He can't answer.
How did that happen?
From yelling at his staff!
Come.
Vassili, look who's here!
Constance, my princess!
So Valentin,
you talk with a hot potato
in your mouth now?
What'sh it to ya, boubourse?
You think you're sho hot
with that shitty shlicker acshent?
And that dumbash faish!
Guesh what.
If ya ma shaw you now,
she'd shob.
Shkut ya mouth, you'll eat ya nosh!
How can you talk like that?
You speak Shitty now?
Ch'ti, Dad!
I'm meeting Valentin halfway.
Is your brain damaged too?
I'm fighting to save our company!
It's his language.
Give me a break.
And I love him.
The man you love is gone, honey.
You want to live
with a Bob's Furniture designer?
It's not even the money.
This is about art,
life choices, philosophy.
It's been 3 weeks.
He's made zero progress.
You hate the perception
that you're his muse, his trophy.
Can you handle
the attitude of your profession?
Our cynical milieu. Your friends there!
They're judging you blind!
Hi, Uncle.
Hi.
Look, this is for you.
Thanks!
Very pretty.
I got drawings of the family. Each one.
They'll like them.
Uncle?
Why don't you come in?
Why stay in the car?
I don't like who I've become.
I'm trying to recall who I was.
You adults are too complicated.
Always saying.
"You wouldn't understand."
"lt's too hard to explain."
"Don't ask questions."
"You'll see when you're older."
But when you get older
life gets harder to understand.
And the thing you miss most...
is being little.
That's true.
So what should I do?
Too hard to explain.
You wouldn't understand.
You're too old.
Mom!
Look who's here.
Hi, Louloute.
Gus!
Britney, inshide!
Don't talk to shtrangers!
Hear me out 5 minutes,
then I'll be gone.
- We don't want your money.
- Why not?
Yeah, we want it.
All thish came between Gus and me.
Yeah, but we made up now.
Cause of you, he'sh off the wagon.
Nah, it'sh only beer.
Not alcohol. Jush quenches my thirst.
Quenching thirst with beer
at 8 AM!
Better shtop drinking!
Go now, Valentin.
Way to tell him, Louloute.
Forgive me for betraying our love.
For leaving you,
running off to Paris... selfishly.
What do you think?
You think I wound up with your brother
on the rebound?
That'sh all wrong.
All right, I mean my Gus...
He'sh no world-beater.
Not a shpeck of ambition.
Drinksh like a fishka, eatsh like a pig,
proud as shee-ut.
But he ain't lazy.
He'sh got moxie.
He's generoush. Heart on his shleeve.
If he got nothing,
he shtill shares.
Every morning and every night,
for the last 15 years,
he getsh my toothbrush ready,
with toothpashte on it.
Near a glash of water.
Jush like that.
Shimple ash pie.
That'sh why I love him.
I chose him.
Quit shobbin'!
- I'm sho moved.
- Nah, you're tanked.
Yeah, but I'm moved too.
What you shaid is sho purdy.
Because me too, I love my Louloute.
Every morning and every night,
for 15 years,
she cooks my meals,
does the shopping,
gets Britney at school...
Shut ya trap.
- Cleans...
- Button it!
- Laundry...
- Shut up.
I love you sho much.
Give me a chance to make it right.
You shee that number?
You'll make better use of it than me.
Valentin, careful!
Dad, what're you doing?
Grampa's angry-
Go back inshide.
Dad, stop!
Are you crazy, Dad?
Get outta my shight!
Fine.
Put my car down so I can go.
25 years ago,
you couldn't leave either!
Who patched together your jalopy
so you could go live your dream?
Who gave you his life savings?
So you could go to that artish shkool?
Dad...
And who, once he was in Paris,
forgot where he came from?
Who junked that caréte
cause it was too common?
You're ashamed of me.
You are!
Well shame on you!
STOP, Joseph!
No, Dad!
Dad...
Want to be an orphan?
Go ahead, shoot!
Shoot!
I'm sorry.
Please forgive me, Pa.
I am shameful.
I didn't want to hurt you, I love you.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, Ma.
I love you both.
I don't love myself.
I'm sorry.
Tintin!
You're tanked, too.
No, I'm moved.
- Almost time.
- We'll be right there.
Where the hell is he?
I don't know. He didn't come home,
his phone is off.
I hope he didn't hear you
at the gallery.
He's not coming.
Kate will be insulted.
She already has doubts.
We'll lose the account. What a mess!
I just hope he's all right.
What's that?
- Love, you OK?
- Yes!
A small disagreement with my dad,
but it's all ironed out.
He's not talking Shitty anymore.
Time for our presentation.
They're 20 minutes late.
Sorry we're late. Car trouble.
Naish to shee ya!
Y'all feeling all right today?
Give me an ansher!
Yeah! Let'sh get exshited!
Ya feeling all right?
So enthushiashtic!
Valentin, what are you doing?
I've decided to change the plan,
because furniture for shnob-ash twits
ish too ugly for you.
What'sh needed today?
Reshyclable and comfortable!
For the young, reshyclable,
for the old, comfortable.
Shomething for all ages.
Any queshtions?
You happy?
We've been cut before the choice!
What a shame.
You really suck.
Why did you lie?
No, I was lying before.
To you, to myself,
to everyone.
I forgot who I was.
Now I'm free of the lies.
I've never felt better.
Great, nice going.
By ruining everything.
But did you think about me?
All the time, Constance.
I wish we could start over.
Start over?
What have I been doing
for the last month?
Haven't I tried to understand,
to support and protect you?
Didn't I start learning Ch'ti?
Funny. I feel like
we'd never been so close.
What do you do for me?
You come charging in,
you destroy our company,
humiliating me,
humiliating my father.
Your father?
He ran me over with his car.
You're confused.
He found you, took you to the hospital.
All right.
Darling.
Are you listening?
We lost Sofitel because of him, but...
let's look on the bright side.
I picked up his shares.
The "Valentin D" brand is ours.
Tell me...
They never found
Valentin's hit-and-run driver.
You got there a second later,
you didn't see anyone?
How can that be?
Tell me you didn't run him over,
I'm begging you.
Tell me it wasn't you.
It was an accident.
It was in reverse, I couldn't see.
It was just a stupid accident.
I'm sorry.
No, Constance. Come back.
He wanted to ruin the company,
acknowledge his idiot family.
What'sh thish shalad?
Not from the garden.
- She got it at the shtore.
- Tastes funny.
What ya doing?
I don't believe it!
Dad...
- Want shome?
- No!
I'm good.
No, thanksh.
- What'sh that?
- What ish it?
It's for me.
Ajax Spray'n Wipe,
No need to scrub
Ajax will free you
from your sink and tub!
AfaX Spray'n Wipe!
That'sh how we met.
The shecond time. For real.
I remember very well.
The first and second time.
Which was your favorite?
The third.
Come meet my family.
With pleasure.
One year later...
- ljust love these.
- Thank you.
It's already five.
We better hurry.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're closing early today.
ORGANIC GAS
MADE FROM VEGETABLES
With your fuel,
I'm peaking 20 MPH higher!
Really?
But don't push it.
- Happy birthday, ma'am.
- Thank you.
That'sh today?
No. For me,
it'sh jush once in two yearsh.
That'sh why you look older than me.
Shorry Suzanne, I forgot.
Like every year for fifty years!
580,
600,
610,
620.
In one day.
That's sho much money!
Never enough.
Suzanne?
Did Valentin and Constance
call for your birthday?
Them neither!

Ma, come shee!
What'sh all the lights?
What'sh thish?
All those lights. Look at this!
HaPPY birthday, Suzanne!
When your hair is shpread out,
Like a shunny shummer day,
Turning your pillow
Into fields of golden grain
When the shadow and the light,
Play upon your shkin,
Making poplar treesh and dunes,
For me to get losht in,
How I kerya...
When your lipsh get all shoft,
And your body gets all tight,
When the heavens in your eyes
Are shudden/y clear and bright
When your hands are shaying yesh,
When your fingersh wouldn't dare,
When your modesty gives way,
Van/shes into thin air,
How I kerya...
Come here, come here.
When my body, on your body
Falls heavy and fulfil/ed,
Not knowing anymore
If it is living shtill,
When we 're done making love
As others would make war,
And l, the beaten sho/dier,
who dies...
Can't find the door
How I kerya...
How I ker ya.
I ker ya, alsho.
How I ker ya.
I ker ya alsho, fatsho. Even more sho!
