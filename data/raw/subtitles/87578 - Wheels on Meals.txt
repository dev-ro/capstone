Get up!
Let's go... Who is it?
You can't hide forever!
Had another fight?
I didn't come home last night.
You really shouldn't.
I had no choice
My girlfriend wouldn't let me leave.
She threatened to kill herself.
I had to stay with her!
You're a married man!
Italians are born lovers.
We must be in love!
Just like Chinese must work.
You wouldn't understand.
We understand,
we're just not as compulsive.
We have to go out, what about you?
She'll kill me if I go outside.
Let us go out, then.
She'll kill you too.
We'll go out the balcony,
you can stay.
What about the Spaniard?
I'll go first.
OK, here goes!
Hola...
Hola!
You OK?
Don't you ever take the stairs?
The Italians are at war!
Come on.
You waved the "all clear".
This means "don't jump".
Why didn't you speak?
- I did.
- What did you say?
You jumped before I got it out.
Morning, where's Via Layetana?
Via Layetana?
- Which way to Via Layetana?
- Why?
Via Layetana, right?
Straight, then left,
then straight again.
If you see Mallorca Cresent...
Then what?
That means you took the wrong turn,
because you missed Bilbao Cresent.
Then what should I do?
Go left until you see the fountain.
Make sure it's working.
And if it is?
Via Layetana is straight ahead
What if it isn't?
Water Works has sealed off the street.
You'll have to go around it.
I see, thank you.
- Hola.
- Hola.
Sorry!
I didn't mean to...
I was just washing the van.
He didn't mean it, officer.
Let me help you.
- I'm sorry
- Sorry, officer.
Don't let me catch sight
of you again.
Now get lost!
We won't do it again!
- Morning...
- Morning...
- Did you fall down a chimney?
- No!
What happened to your face?
Those damn Chinese!
"Private Detective Henry Matt"
Don't move!
Boss!
What are you doing?
I'm exercising.
Why didn't you fix the lights?
Power's been cut off.
If the power company overcharges me
I have to wait forever for a refund.
But they're quick when I owe them money.
Unlike me. Who else would come to work,
after not being paid in 3 months?
What do you mean?
If not for me,
you'd never get a work(visa).
You could kiss Spain goodbye!
That's true!
I couldn't pay your bills
because you didn't pay me.
That's better.
Anyone looking for me?
The phone company.
On business?
Right.
They disconnected the phone.
No wonder it's so quiet.
Alfonzo came looking for you.
Alone?
He brought 2 goons.
What did he say?
You owe him $100,000.
That's the code we use.
What does it mean?
It means he has a new lead.
He asked when you'd be back.
Tell him I'm out of town.
That's also a code, it means...
- Tell him yourself.
- Why?
He's coming back at 12!
It's almost time!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?
Relax! Is that a code too?
That's the code for danger,
I need to hide out.
From now on you're
Acting Chief of the agency.
You're in charge while I'm away.
A promotion...
What about a raise?
Forget it!
Chief, hm!...
I ought to wear a tie.
Please sit, sit, sit!
Before you start, I must tell you...
I won't do anything illegal.
I don't have the guts.
Now you may state your business.
I need you to find someone.
I've never...
Never found anyone before?
I've never failed before.
I didn't expect you to be...
Chinese?
I'll get to the point.
I want you to find a woman
named Gloria and her child.
Just one?
Just one.
Boy or girl?
You'll need to find that out.
Here's the information on Gloria.
It's not much,
it was taken 22 years ago.
This won't be easy.
That's why I need your help.
You may have the case on 2 conditions.
I have conditions too,
but you go first.
Keep it to yourself...
and find them within 14 days.
Here's the down payment.
If you deliver them
you'll get $20,000.
Now tell me your conditions.
My condition is I accept your conditions.
Excellent!
Call me at this number.
Is this a trick?
What are you doing?
This is a better antiseptic.
I look forward to your good news.
Let's get started!
Right! Go get some orders!
- A coke!
- OK!
- What would you like?
- Coffee with milk
Right away!
- Anything for you?
- No thanks.
What would you like?
- A number 22 and a 16.
- Right away!
Anything for you, Picasso?
- A coke!
- Coke it is!
- Here you are!
- Right!
1 salad and 2 hot dogs.
Fried rice.
- Double order!
- Hang on!
Yours!
Here you go!
- For you!
- Thanks!
What is it?
Oh, the fumes!
- Let's go.
- I can't eat this.
How can I do business?
Can you go somewhere else?
What's your problem?
You're ruining my business.
Beat it, kid!
Well?
Once around the square.
Loser picks up the tab tonight.
You're on!
I'll start you! Ready...go!
Faster!
Get lost!
Faster!
What happened?
They chased people away!
I'll get rid of them.
Save your breath, I already tried.
Pack up, let's go.
Why?
To play Robin Hood.
Faster!
My mother said I can do anything,
except get in a fight.
Did she tell you not to cause trouble?
Yes, but I forgot.
I'm not fighting you! I'm leaving.
Fine!
Let's get back to work.
May I see your pass.
- Thank you
- Bye! Bye!
When will your dad be released?
It's not like he has hemorrhoids!
Mental illness is hard to cure.
Damn, a flat tire!
Don't get upset, I have a spare.
I'm not upset, I just said damn.
You shouldn't say that.
What should I say?
Ha, ha, a flat tire!
You're nuts! Normal people don't say that.
Ha, ha! A flat tire!
You're right, only nut cases
would say that.
Let's just change it.
Do you have a magnet?
No, why?
I need to tie it to a string.
Why would you do that?
So I can lower it into the sewer.
- Something wrong with you?
- No, why?
Why do you want to lower
the magnet into the sewer?
To retrieve the nuts.
What nuts?
- These nuts?
- Smart kid!
No wonder you need a magnet!
- I told you.
- Now we're stuck.
I can't believe
people can be so stupid!
Oh, yeah?
My brain may be a bit messed up
but it's definitely
better than yours.
What do you mean?
Take one nut from each of
the other 3 tires.
Those 3 nuts
can hold your spare,
till you get back to the city.
Brilliant!
You're a smart guy, pal!
Why are you here?
Are you nuts?
I'm here for being crazy,
not for being stupid!
"Stupid" and "crazy" are not the same!
Understand, stupid?
I'm not wasting my time on you,
I can't teach you anything.
I'll go find another beach.
Let's hurry up and fix it!
What's he doing?
- I don't know.
- Ask him.
- We better not.
- I will, then.
What are you doing?
I'm a clock, I tell the time.
What time is it now?
2:30.
No, it's 2:45.
Damn, I'm running slow!
- What's your dad doing?
- Fishing.
Dad, Thomas came to see you.
Sh! Not so loud.
You'll scare the fish.
Are you bored, Uncle Chan?
The whole world is boring.
Did you find a girl for David?
Chinese girls are hard to find in Spain.
Spanish girls are nice too.
Love knows no nationality.
He's enlightened.
Now I'm really worried.
What's that guy doing?
Telling himself a joke.
Isn't that funny?
He's not laughing now.
He heard that one before.
- Thinks he's Columbus...
- Yes.
Are you fishing?
Catch one for me.
Are you crazy too?
You can't fish from a basin!
Your father's improving.
That's the alarm!
I have a date.
Come along, I don't mind.
Who's his date?
I don't know.
No wonder he said
love knows no nationality!
No wonder he's improving!
Where's your mother?
Still getting ready.
She sent me to tell you.
No problem, I'll wait.
Tell her to take her time.
I know what you're thinking.
What you think I'm thinking,
is definitely not what you're thinking.
I don't think you're thinking that.
But I do know what you're thinking.
Because I'm thinking the same thing.
In that case, since we're both
thinking the same thing...
We should both forget about it.
She's pretty.
She's my Dad's.
OK.
We're leaving, Uncle Chan
See you next week, Dad.
Wait. Meet my friend.
Some other time.
Here she is.
Gloria!
Darling!
You look gorgeous!
I missed you!
I know what you're thinking.
Me too.
We're thinking the same thing.
Let's go!
I have to go!
Bye, Mom! See you, Uncle Chan
- Tell your dad we're leaving.
- OK.
- See you, Dad!
- We have to go.
Wait...
Meet Gloria.
My son David.
His friend Thomas.
- Hola!
- Hola!
Now get lost and leave us alone!
C'mon!
Hey, she's waiting for a ride.
Here's our chance.
We'll say we're going into town
and offer her a ride.
What if she'd rather take a cab?
Who'd rather do that?
Why don't you talk to her.
I'll get the van.
This will be good practice for you.
You talk to her, I'll get the van!
- Hola!
- Hola!
Miss, your ride's here.
Bye-bye!
- She said no?
- I didn't ask.
You call yourself a man?
Would've been the same,
if I had asked.
Certainly not!
If you don't ask,
you have no chance.
If you do, there's at least
a 50/50 chance.
Elegant, generous and pleasant.
She's a princess!
A princess with a crazy mother?
Why not?
Maybe. Get in!
2,000?
Your mother's worth more!*
Don't get fresh. Let's haggle.
4,000.
OK.
2 coffees, Thomas.
What's your hurry?
It doesn't take long.
Remember to settle their accounts.
How much do I owe you, Thomas?
1,250.
Here's 1,300.
- Keep the change.
- Thanks.
Can I have a spring roll? Thanks.
No wonder she's so generous.
The spring roll costs 70.
Are you new?
- How much?
- 15,000.
3,000.
Save it for your funeral.
- 3,000?
- 2,000.
Go next door.
- Hola!
- Hola!
I saw the princess!
Are you kidding?
The princess wouldn't come here!
Maybe I'm seeing things.
Go see for yourself.
15,000.
15,000? That's only $100, US.
Fair enough! Let's go.
She took off with him.
So, what's your problem?
She's not your girl.
You've been generous to us.
Now, it's our treat.
We'll show you a good time.
Thanks, but no thanks.
I can't believe she's a hooker.
At least she's a high-priced one.
She must be short on cash.
How much do you have?
- Why?
- Give it to me.
All I have is 20,000.
Hey, that's much more than one trick!
So what? I'll give it to her
so she can quit.
For tonight! What about tomorrow?
There are so many.
Each with their own reasons.
We can't help them all.
If they each take a spring roll,
we'll go broke!
Get back to work.
You stole my wallet!
Come back here!
A girl stole my wallet.
Tall and skinny, in a red dress.
- Really?
- She was quick.
What a fool!
He should watch his wallet.
What's wrong?
I feel dizzy.
What do you wanna do?
Let's go home.
OK, let me finish this order first.
Thomas, have you seen a girl?
Tall and skinny...
- Tall... skinny?
- Yes!
Over there!
You're such a joker!
- Now what?
- Let's look around.
Your princess is not only
a hooker, she's also a thief.
Maybe he lost his wallet somewhere.
and tried to pin it on her.
Unless he caught her in the act,
he shouldn't make accusations.
We're home.
I know that.
I'm not talking to you.
- Miss!
- Hola!
How dare you lie to me!
Not feeling well, hey?
Don't get mad.
I know you have compassion.
Get out of the car.
End of your ride, I'm afraid.
I didn't say I'm leaving.
Then come in for a visit.
Are you trying to tell me
she's not welcome?
No, I made a mistake.
We live upstairs.
It's our pleasure to have you.
Thanks!
Romeo is home too.
Have you seen Fatso?
No.
- Who died?
- No one.
You're dressed for a funeral.
Long time no see!
Moby, have a drink.
I can't get drunk today.
Have you seen Fatso?
I just got here!
What do you need?
How do you know
I need something from him?
I'm now Acting Chief
of Matt's agency,
but please, don't tell anyone.
I wouldn't do that. Drink up!
I can't be drunk today.
Long time no see, Moby! Drink up!
- Just one.
- OK.
- Sit down...
- Get me a drink.
Have you seen Fatso?
No, what do you need?
Can I trust you?
We've known each other for years.
Forget it!
I already know too many secrets.
Keep this one to yourself!
Listen...
Don't tell anyone
I'm Acting Chief of Matt's agency.
I'm in charge right now.
I need to talk to Fatso about something...
That calls for a drink.
- Thanks.
- Cheers!
Moby has been promoted.
I really can't get drunk.
I have to find Fatso.
Congratulations, Moby!
Salud!
- Salud!
- Salud!
Now you know my secret.
Please keep it to yourselves.
Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!
- Bye-bye!
Darling, this is Moby.
A kiss? Sure!
No, I wouldn't forget you!
I'm busy right now.
I swear it's the truth.
His girlfriend is such a pig!
Tonight? I really can't.
Alright...another kiss?
Loud enough? Hold on...
It's your wife!
Please!
I'll kill you, you two timing...
Come out! I wanna kill you!
Calm down, Susanna.
I found lipstick on his underpants.
Listen...
They're not mine.
They're ladie's panties.
Why are you wearing them?
I was in a rush...
I'm gonna kill him!
Hey, that's our door!
Out of my way...
Point it at your own door.
Let go...
Lemme go!
Bouncy!
If you're afraid to lose him
killing him won't help.
He's only fooling around.
He'll come back to you.
If you kill him,
you'll lose him forever.
I love him.
Go talk to him.
Dino... Answer me!
You know how much I love you?
I love you too.
Remember how we met?
- It was love at first sight
- Really?
You're my whole life
I can't live without you.
Dino...
You bastard, I'll kill you!
Come back here, you bastard!
Sorry to be a bother!
No bother at all.
I'm staying!
What?
You object?
No! As long as she's not afraid of us.
- Afraid of you?
- Hm!
Why?
You sleep-walk.
Fatso!
What happened, Fatso?
Were you robbed?
Good thing I came late.
You're too heavy!
What happened?
Never mind. None of my business.
I got a question for you.
Tell me, when you were
the Pimp King, 18  years ago,
did you know a Gloria?
She was either pregnant,
or had just had a baby.
What? The thugs who beat you up,
were after Gloria too?
Did you tell them anything?
- I wouldn't...
- Thank God!
I wouldn't be alive if I didn't.
Do you know where she is now?
I don't know...
Hey buddy!
Speak up!
Where did she use to live?
62 Thanksgiving Street.
Hey, what if she...
Let's hide our money.
What if she wants to steal from us
and can't find the money?
She'll think we don't trust her.
It'll hurt her pride.
True!
We'll take out most of the money
and just leave a little.
If she takes it,
it'll be a small price to pay
to find out about her.
You're smart for a change, David
- Is that your shirt?
- Yes.
It looks better on her.
Talking about me?
Beautiful!
That's all?
Gorgeous!
Where shall I sleep?
- In...
- The living room
Thanks! My name is Sylvia
- I'm David
- I'm Thomas
Good night!
I'm not sleepy, you guys go ahead.
I'll watch TV.
- Let me turn it on for you!
- Thanks.
I'm going to bed.
You'll sleep better with a pillow.
Thanks.
- Shall I get you some water?
- Sure.
It gets cold at night.
I got you a blanket.
- Thanks!
- You're welcome.
Let me get you some warm milk instead.
Sure.
Thanks.
Stop wasting time.
Who's first?
Makes no difference to me.
Forget it!
- Morning!
- Morning!
Everything alright?
- Sure.
- Good!
- Have you seen my car?
- No!
Susanna, my car's been stolen!
Darling... the car is gone!
Call the police.
Hmm, the Princess left early...
Musn't be so suspicious!
One mustn't slander people, but
there's no harm in being prudent.
Have a little faith in humanity!
My money's gone!
I told you.
She's not that simple.
I speak from experience
Putting your money in the drawer
is too obvious!
I'm much smarter.
I put it in my shoes.
Damn! She took my money too!
Serves you right.
I told you not to take her in!
You never said that!
She cleaned us out!
No, not entirely.
I'll show her when I see her again!
Likewise.
- What would you do?
- Make sure she has enough.
Where did you learn how to drive?
- Do you have a license?
- I'm sorry!
I'll pay for the damages.
Of course, it was your fault!
Look what you did to my car!
Please forgive me!
You're lucky you ran into me.
Driving like that is dangerous.
My brother warned me.
I'm so careless!
It's my brother's car. Dino Martin.
Please give him a call.
He'll get it fixed for you.
But...
They'll dock my pay
if I'm late for work. Call me.
- Alright!
- Thanks!
Back up...
Bye!
Who are you?
What do you want?
You're coming with us.
To the police station?
You're not cops, I don't know you!
Where are you taking me?
Somewhere nice! Please cooperate
What if I refuse?
Then we'll have to use force.
Lemme go...
Forget him. Get the girl!
Let's split up!
It's them!*
You're quite capable.*
When can you deliver her?
I got a question.
Why don't you trust me?
If you hired me,
why send those other men?
Which other men?
I should ask you that.
They're a nasty lot!
I didn't hire anyone else.
- Then why...?
- That's not your concern.
Just make sure they don't get Sylvia.
It's definitely my concern.
I need to know who I'm up against.
- Otherwise I quit!
- Wait!
About what happened,
I'm truly sorry...
but there's nothing I can do.
I can only increase your fee.
You need to think it over?
Give me 3 seconds.
1, 2, 3. I'll do it.
- Excellent. Bless you.
- Thanks!
- Hola!
- Hola!
Moby is so stingy,
what does he want with us?
He's up to something.
Whatever he says, we say no.
Sit down... sit.
- Can't say no to that!
- True.
What would you like?
3 beers and a bottle of brandy.
How's business?
Terrible! Worse than before.
What about the van?
Do you like the re-fitting?
- No, worse than before.
How's your father?
Worse than before.
How can he get any worse?
Don't listen to him.
He's much better.
Wonderful!
Here's our drinks.
To David's father!
No!
- What?
- Cheers!
This isn't working.
Just play dumb.
I need a favor.
I bumped into a girl's car
this morning.
No wonder the dog downstairs
gave birth to 4 puppies!
Puppies?! What's that got to do
with my accident?
What's your accident
got to do with us?
Listen...
After the accident
the girl gave me a card.
Told me it was her brother's car.
So?
When I found the guy,
he said he has no sister
and that his car was stolen.
I described the girl and he said
she might be the girl
you brought home last night.
Still none of our business.
She gave me some money.
Told me to give it to you.
She paying us back?
No! She's giving it to you.
What?! She robbed us last night!
You've been had too,
that makes it your business.
Cut the crap. Give me the money.
She hasn't given me mine yet.
I need to move around a bit.
Me too.
You know where can I find her?
Try where she lives.
Does she have a favorite hangout?
The ladies' room.
Stop fooling, I'm serious!
Seriously, I don't know.
Fine! Forget what I said!
C'mon !..
You just said forget it.
Don't be like that.
We already told you we don't know.
Fine! Forget what I said!
I was wrong about you
You won't even help a friend.
A fellow Chinese.
All I want is information
but you refuse to help.
You won't even lift a finger...
I can hear myself clearly
Why can't you hear me?
What?
The worst Spaniards
are better than you!
What did you say?
It's too noisy, I can't hear.
I said the worst Spaniards...
Sorry, I was out of line.
Go ahead, play me for a fool!
Who is this Sylvia?
A Spanish girl.
Idiot!
Why are people after her?
- Because she's pretty!
- Moron!
Moron?! She's very smart!
I meant you!
- Sylvia!
- David!
Long time no see, how are you?
24 hours isn't long!
They're forcing me...
Watch your manners, pal!
How dare you...
- What's going on?
- Ask them.
That girl stole my wallet.
They're her accomplices.
Come back!
She fooled us again!
Don't believe anything she says.
Remind yourself,
I never trusted her.
She's always getting us into trouble.
You're overreacting!
- It's you!
- It's you!
I came to thank you.
If not for you two
I'd be in jail now.
Cut the crap!
If we knew why they were after you,
we wouldn't have helped you.
Ask her to stay!
- I thought you...
- Call her back!
Come back!
We want to ask you something.
Mind coming by our place?
I'd mind if you didn't invite me.
Don't you have something to ask her?
You'd better do the talking.
- Me?
- Go on!
- You want... something to drink?
- Red wine?
I'll get it! Here goes...
The night you slept over,
we found out the next morning
You left the clothes and tidied up.
(But our money was gone!)
So did you...
I'll ask her.
What David is trying to say...
The night you slept over,
did you take our money?
Yes.
Did you steal from those men?
Yes.
Don't be so harsh.
Harsh? You do it!
Why did you do it?
If you find an honest job...
What he's saying...
As a hooker,
you can make a good living...
I won't be called a hooker.
I use my head, I don't sell my body.
I can't be bought.
Look, I'm just his interpreter.
You should slap him.
Stealing is wrong.
When I was 14,
my mother was put away.
From that day onwards,
I've been on my own.
Nobody helped me.
The men I've met,
no matter what they said,
they just wanted to get me in bed.
He was thinking the same thing.
Stealing their money,
is only what they deserve.
Next time you meet a pretty
girl, remember this.
I warned you not to get involved.
I don't mean you.
Not after tonight.
I know you're good to me.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.
Just make sure you pay him first.
He needs the money more
than me, to get married.
No way! I'm just saving up
for a rainy day.
Oh, in that case, pay me first.
As long as it's honest money.
Thomas told me, your Mom and
my Dad are good friends.
I should watch out for you, right?
Right!
I'm worried you'll steal again.
Given a choice, nobody likes
to be a criminal.
What if you get a second chance?
I'm willing to start over.
Excellent!
We need extra help, right?
No, I don't thin...
Oh, right...but
You probably won't last.
You haven't even given me
a chance, yet. How do you know?
OK. There's even a raise
if you pass your probation.

I want to talk to you.
Come with me!
What is it? What do you want?
Listen to me.
I don't care about my wallet.
I just want you to meet someone.
You stand to gain from it.
What do you say?
Help!
Don't yell!
I don't mean you any harm!
I'm a private detective.
Just meet my client...
and my job's done.
Do me a favor. Please believe me!
Just come with me.
I'll let go. Don't yell, OK?
I grew up on the streets.
Your tricks don't fool me.
Stop wasting your time.
- Where?
- Over there!
- Miss...
- Stay back, or I'll throw this...
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Sylvia's in danger. You'll be
sorry if you don't believe me.
Can I borrow your stool?
- Where?
- Over there!
Now what?
Pack up and go after her!
Stop!
Let me go!
- Let her go
- Don't come near!
Run!
Get in!
Get in the car
After them!
Step on it! They're gaining!
- I can't stand it.
- Sit on my lap!
No way! Get in the back. Quick!
Back up! Hurry!
What's wrong with you?
Thank goodness I drive a sports car.
Otherwise I'd be dead.
Watch it, next time!
- Dead end!
- Had to jump...
Hang on!
You ditched them!
They're not behind us anymore.
No, they're in front!
I dare you to ram us!
Move...
Time to use my weapons.
Ready...aim...fire!
Let me try!
Here's some lubricant for you.
Strike...
How about a ramp?
How are we doing?
Clean sweep!
All you guys can't get one girl?
There can only be one reason.
You're all useless.
Besides eating, what you can do?
You've wasted 6 days.
Now there are 8 days left.
God took 6 days to create the world.
8 days to bring the girl back
should be enough.
My inheritance
will depend upon you.
- These men
- Who...?
You go first.
Who were those men?
Your turn.
What you said.
- This isn't the first time.
- Damn right!
Moby!
Don't lurk, I could have shot you!
I can dodge.
They failed this time, but...
they'll keep trying until they get her.
- Who's "they"?
- The bad guys.
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I'm the good guy.
What's going on?
A simple story that got complicated.
2 parties are after her --
those men and me.
I play fair and square.
They're unscrupulous
and want to kidnap her.
I'm looking for Sylvia
to bring her to meet my client.
I don't know what
those men want with her.
I'm confused.
You didn't really explain much.
You must know what your client
wants with me.
Yes, I should.
But my client refused to tell me
So, I really don't know.
Moby!
Tell us something you do know.
I know 2 things.
First, it's not safe here.
Why, is there a gas leak?
I can't help it if you
won't believe me.
Second, if Sylvia wants to know
what my client wants with her
she should go see him.
- I know something too.
- What?
The dumbest private dick,
is right here in our house.
Don't insult me
if you don't believe me.
We believe you.
How long have you been
a private eye?
6 days.
You haven't even earned
your first weekly paycheck.
Asking us to believe you
is an insult to our intelligence.
Fine! Say no more!
You're breaking my heart.
Hold them off, Moby!
- We'll take the balcony!
- See you later, Moby!
Hold them off!
- David, go first!
- Right!
Come on!
Run, Moby!
Hurry!
After them!
Why are we running?
They're after Sylvia.
So? We won't let them have her.
We'll fight them.
We're outnumbered.
We're used to fighting
more than 10 guys at a time.
Counting the bystanders?
We'll prove it.
- Take Sylvia.
- Let's go!
- Tough guys.
- Real tough.
We'd better run.
Come on!
Where are we?
Some dump.
It's a dead end, let's go back!
- Now what?
- Find somewhere to hide.
- Who has a torch?
- I do!
Never mind.
Look carefully.
It stinks!
I know, bear with it.
They're not here!
They must be here! Keep looking!
Hnngh! That's better!
I can't stand it!
You must, or we'll be dead.
I can't stand it!
What a loser!
You ruined everything!
Run!
Money for you! Come and get it
Move!... Move!
They won't get far, hurry!
What? I'm willing to cooperate.
Glad to hear it.
How can I help you?
We've been paid to throw you off this roof.
Would you jump instead?
- You must have the wrong guy
- No!
- Who hired you?
- Me!
You?
You hired someone to kidnap me.
I hired someone
to help you play superman.
No, no, help! Help!
Listen... I'm your father!
He's your father?
You're my father?
No, I'm not your father,
I'm his butler.
What's going on?
Start talking!
Count Lobas is your father.
Gloria worked for him 20 years ago.
One night, while the Countess was away...
He raped Gloria?!
When she became pregnant
the Count sent her away.
The son of a bitch!
Don't say that about him!
I hate him! I never want to see him!
He's dead.
Before he passed away
he wanted to find you and your mother,
so his brother wouldn't
inherit everything.
I didn't reveal the reason
in consideration of your safety.
Even the private detective I hired
is the dumbest I could find.
Thank goodness Moby is not here.
Says who?
I'm always out of luck.
The things I wanna know,
no one will tell me.
What I don't wanna know,
I hear about it on the radio.
But I did find the right man
for the job.
According to family tradition,
Gloria and Sylvia must show up within 14 days
Otherwise the entire estate
will go to his brother Mondale.
Those men must work for Mondale.
3 more days!
Where are you doing?
We thought Sylvia was alone and helpless,
that's why we helped her.
If she's the Count's daughter
our business is finished.
You mean...
If Sylvia is alone and helpless,
you're good enough
to hang around with her.
But if she's the Count's daughter,
then she's out of your league?
We wanted to help her at first.
Don't you know
now is the time she needs you most!
Don't you want a better life for her?
Yes, you can help her.
I'm alone.
You've seen Mondale's thugs
They'll keep trying
over the next few days.
If you're her friends
you wouldn't leave her
at a time like this!
OK, OK, don't rub it in!
Or you'll shame us into
jumping from here.
So, how can we help Gloria?
What are you looking at, bitch?
I'll kill you!
Get back!
I'll kill you"
Get back
Don't come near!
Let me go!
Good!
Untie me!
You have to look the part, lie down!
Turn off the siren.
They're dancing over there!
What is it?
They're dancing over there!
Here's another nut case.
He's mouthing.
Is he eating or trying to say something?
I hate guessing games.
I'm not crazy, pal!
Do me a favor, untie me.
- You're normal like us?
- Yeah!
Give him a test.
Listen up...
3 worms are moving forward
in a single file.
The first worm says there are
2 worms behind him.
The last one says there are
2 in front of him.
The one in the middle
says there are no worms near him.
Do you know why?
- It's blind?
- No.
I don't know.
Your question is too tough!
- Is this too tough?
- Yes.
Why did the middle worm say
there are no worms nearby?
Because it was lying.
Worms don't lie!
It's trick question.
Who tied you up?
It's a secret!
Come nearer and I'll tell you.
You can't tell anyone, OK?
That's why I had to play crazy
What did he tell you?
I can't tell anyone.
I'm not 'anyone'! What did he say?
He said I can't tell anyone.
Speak up!
Stop hitting me!
Hey!
Damn! Now I'm stuck here.
What did you tell him, pal?
Why should I tell you?
I'll untie you if you tell me.
I don't trust you.
Tell me!
Don't tell anyone.
Understand?
What can't he tell anyone?
Why must we go? I like it here.
What are you waiting for? Let's go!
Go where?
Mom can't part with Uncle Chan
and Uncle Chan won't leave.
Tell him you're marrying Sylvia
and you need him at the wedding.
I can't be part of that lie.
Then tell him the truth.
Just get him out of here!
Let me talk to him.
If you love Gloria
why don't you marry her?
Why didn't I think of that?
Why did you say that?
- You object?
- Ah... No.
Nobody objects.
Gloria, will you marry me?
What took you so long?
Congratulations!
Sylvia is your sister now.
Happy now?
Why don't you say something?
He's your brother now.
Hi, brother.
Don't get upset!
I thought of a way.
You can disown your father!
That'll work. Right?
Finally!
What's this bulldozer doing here?
Why do you think?
You want me to step on the clutch,
pull the hand brake,
take out the key, get out of the van,
go check it out and tell you?
Cut the crap! Just ask nicely!
What is it?
You just can't do anything!
Moby...
- Are you alright?
- Not really!
Don't hit my son!
- Let me go
- Shut up!
Move that thing!
- Why are you still there?
- I don't have the key!
Push it aside!
You do it!
The butler was right,
getting in is easy.
Going unnoticed is tough!
Come on!
I have 7 ways to get in.
Why 7?
Why not 6 or 8?
7 is my lucky number.
We only need one that works.
Sorry, the ways I know
don't include that one.
We'll get in the back way.
The front is guarded,
but they're usually careless.
I'd rather take the front.
It's too dangerous.
What about you?
I don't like either plan.
We can't even disagree properly.
We're a sheet of loose sand.
No, we're only 3 grains of sand.
We're hopeless at this!
Get down, now, if you have the guts!
Brilliant! I don't.
- How are you getting in?
- Through the door.
- It's guarded.
- I'll wait.
Till dawn?
Let's climb a tree.
Elephants can't climb trees.
Well then, wait.
Stop playing! Stay alert!
Don't complain...
If I pitched a top spin
it would still be a foul ball.
Hide them!
I have some good news.
Someone is here to save you.
But I also have bad news.
He's been caught.
Move!
Hi, how are you?
Don't be rude!
Let him sit down!
Thanks.
Cheers!
Hey, what now?
Back home to get some sleep.
What?! Sleep?
We have to save her!
Then why did you ask me?
Come up!
How? I'm not you!
Then find your own way!
- It's me!
- I know.
But you kicked me!
You didn't scream.
That's how I knew it was you.
We better split up!
What are you doing up there?
- Coming to the party?
- Yes.
I shouldn't have let you come.
You almost ruined everything!
Take care of him!
Let's party!
Your moves, as well as
the dress, are seamless.
You like this classic look?
Sit down, Mom.
I'm hungry.
Set the table for one more.
Since you're here...
why don't you
introduce yourself properly.
Sorry, I'm late.
What's on the menu?
Roast lamb.
I was born in the year of the Lamb.
Must be a bad sign,
I made a fool of myself.
Such distinguished guests
for dinner tonight!
I'm very honored!
Tonight is very important.
For the Lobas family
this night is a disgrace!
Having you two in the family
is the biggest disgrace!
Don't be upset.
Mr. Mondale...
if word got out you kidnapped them
Your reputation would be compromised.
Thanks for reminding me,
but I know what I'm doing.
I don't see it as a problem.
- Keep them entertained.
- Yes, sir!
- Take them to the dungeon.
- Yes, sir!
I haven't finished the soup.
Where are you taking me?
Move!
Help is on the way!
Hang in there, he's not that tough!
Take care of him! I'll help Thomas.
Come on!
Come, come!
Come, come!
I'll handle him, get Sylvia
Can you manage?
No! You better take over. Come on...
How dare you stab me in the back!
Come on, tough guy!
Relax! Take it easy...
Consider this a training session
Come on...
Wait!
1, 2, 3, 4...2, 2, 3, 4
3, 2, 3, 4
Here!
Impressive...
I shouldn't clown around.
What a punch!
Pull me up for another round!
Don't let go, pal!
What's taking you so long?
I've been waiting for you.
The 3 Musketeers are invincible!
Above waist!
Below waist!
Chinese fire drill!
We're invincible!
Hola!
How are you?
What would you like?
A hamburger and Coke.
Have a seat over there.
Cheer up, David.
Thinking of Sylvia?
Serve the food!
David, c'mere, c'mere...
- What?
- Look!
Dropping by to visit?
I need a summer job. Are you hiring?
You bet!
You wish this summer never ends.
Hi!
Well, well! The detective
without a license!
Watch it!
The International Federation
of Private Detectives
just sent me a membership card.
Now I have a proper license.
Congratulations!
Are you looking to expand?
If you take on another job with me
you'll have 20 vans in no time.
- Another castle?
- No, a cottage!
Who are we saving?
A president
kidnapped by African cannibals.
Cannibals!
Someone's looking for you...
