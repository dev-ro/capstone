Good morning, Raj.
Get up, son. It is morning.
Good morning, papa.
- Good morning, son.
Hey, get up. You've to go to
school. - Has he not got up till yet?
Hey, Raj, get up. See,
grandma has come now.
The father doesn't have a night...
...and the son doesn't
have a morning.
Come on, have your milk.
And you tell me...
You have been sleeping
half and incomplete...
...since so many months, how many
more nights will you stay awake?
Mother, last night was the last
time that I would stay awake.
The project on which I
was working is over.
Come, I will show you. Come on, son.
Papa, you have made a wonderful car.
Did you like it, mother?
It is very good son. But you have
worked on it too, isn't it?
Some companies have offered me.
After applying for the patent, I
have to hold meetings with them.
I am Mr. Rakesh Kapoor.
- Hi. - And these are my partners.
Please come.
This is an eight-cylinder V-engine.
And all this technology
is controlled...
...by computer diagnosis systems.
If the car meets with
an accident, that is.
In making this car, I have paid...
...most of my attention
to the high seating...
...and excellent road
hold to the driver.
You have made such
a beautiful design.
We like your project a lot.
Tell me. What kind of deal
would you wish to make?
I want twenty percent
of the royalty.
The car's logo will be of my name.
We are very impressed
by your design.
But... But we can't understand
these terms of yours.
Sir, my terms are because of
the beauties of my project.
My car is a futuristic car.
And as you people must have seen...
...there isn't any car
made like this...
...which has so many features in it.
And having such good
fuel efficiency too.
We agree that you have made
a excellent car model.
But we have to keep our company...
...name's value in the market.
Therefore, we cannot give your name.
But we will pay whatever you
wish for this project.
But we cannot give you
royalty or partnership.
I do not agree to your deal.
Give him back his disc.
You have made a very
advanced machine.
I don't think that such
a machine can be made...
...in the automobile industry
in the next ten years.
We accept all your conditions.
We will give you a royalty, and
give the car your name too.
I have a discussion with my
technical team tomorrow.
After that, the next week...
We will sign the agreement.
Mother...
Hey, have you come?
My project deal is finalized. I am
signing the contract next week.
I knew it. True hard work
is never a waste.
Even I have made a car.
- Is it?
You will become a greater
engineer than me.
This can't be possible.
- Why?
Because I can't keep awake
at nights like you.
Donkey!
Papa, why do you wash it everyday?
I make you bathe everyday too,
isn't it? - But why?
The thing that we love...
...shouldn't we keep
his lovely always?
Do you love this car very much?
- Yes.
Why? Papa?
Son, this is my father's symbol.
He had gifted it to me.
I will gift it to you
when you grow up.
Papa, why have you put this Tarzan?
I had kept it here in my childhood.
I believed this car
to be Tarzan and...
...I had even named it as Tarzan.
Tarzan was a man.
Yes, he was a man. But was
strong like this machine.
But papa, Tarzan used
to eat food too.
Where does this car eat food?
Doesn't it?
Then why doesn't it wear clothes?
Even Tarzan didn't wear any clothes.
Just because the censor shouldn't...
...object, the movie
and cartoon Tarzan...
...were made to wear a knickers
made of leaves. - But.
Now don't ask me what a censor is.
It is your phone, son.
- I am coming, mother.
I am Mukund Joshi speaking
from Harsh Motors.
Yes, Mr. Joshi...
Our company doesn't wish
to deal with you. - Why?
The design which you say is yours...
...and using which you wish
to deal with the company...
...Four Fox company has patented
it three months ago.
But... I have completed
the design four...
...days ago and patented
it. Then how...
...come Four Fox patent
it three months ago?
We don't know that. You ask them.
I have an idea.
- What?
We won't make this car ourselves.
Instead, we will give
this car's design...
...to some German or Japanese...
...company and eat it's royalty
throughout life. - Yes!
We cannot give royalty, but we can
take it, isn't it? - Surely.
A stolen thing shouldn't be
dangled by the neck as it is.
Because the one who owns the
thing will strangle you.
You patented my design in your...
...name by bribing the
patent registrar.
We did that, all right.
And you cannot harm
us in anyway now.
I have the receipt of
the patent application.
I will take you four foxes and the...
...patent registrar to the court.
I still have so much proof that
I can have you four arrested.
I will go to the police station
right away and expose you.
I have got the information.
They are not in the office.
They have gone to the farmhouse.
Have you brought your
proofs with you?
The CD of my designs and the...
...receipt of the patent
application is with me.
We will go to their farmhouse
right away. - Come on.
But listen to me carefully. The
agreement that we signed...
He has registered a complaint.
You people have stolen
the designs of his car.
And at this time, he has
the proof with him too.
He had come to us to sell his car.
We didn't complete the deal
so we copied his CD.
We also knew that if he
goes to the court...
...we will have to fight
the case for many years.
And we won't have anything
in our hands.
You are right.
Please give them all the proof.
The problem will be solved.
Hey, there isn't any
need to be shocked.
We own that inspector.
It was your bad luck
that you went to him.
And we know that you wouldn't
give us the proof.
Therefore, he will kill you now.
And he will close your file too.
I had heard that every
dog has it's day.
But I hadn't heard any
phrase for foxes.
You committed a huge mistake
my calling me here.
I am an automobile engineer.
I can ruin the design
as well as make it!
He broke my leg! That dog!
I will call the police
and press now.
I will strip your uniform with
the skin of these four people.
What do you think? Are there
saints and seers in business?
You will ruin the design? Take this!
You call us foxes?
Please stop.
Don't kill him here.
We will put him in his car and
put him in the lake behind.
It will never be found out whether
it was an accident or a murder.
The inspector is right.
- Okay.
We will give you name and royalty
both in your rebirth.
Go. Go and design a flying machine...
...for the God of Death, Go!
Hey, battery! Don't you see
even after wearing glasses?
That place is not for
parking your cycle.
It is for parking our bikes.
So where should I park?
Hey, do you think that we
are parking instructors?
Come on, park it anywhere.
Hey, battery. Come here. Come here.
See, battery. You passed
and came into our class.
What does that mean?
This means that you
failed this time too?
Are you very happy?
- No. I am sorry.
You are expressing your sorrow with
such happiness. - Come here.
Come here.
Okay, tell me. How is two and two?
- Yes?
What are you stammering for?
Tell me how much they are?
Two and two are four.
You fool. Two and two
are twenty-two, what?
Tell me, how much is it?
Twenty-two.
Now he has come in our category.
What is going on?
- Oh God! Double battery!
What are you doing here?
- Nothing sir.
Everyone calls this
poor kid as battery.
We were just asking
him his real name.
No sir. No body else, they
call me battery. - Why?
Because I wear spectacles, isn't it?
This means that you must be calling
me a battery too? - No sir.
These people call you
a double battery. - What!
I will rusticate you people,
what do you think?
You will sit here all
through your life?
You will ruin his life too?
I won't let this happen!
Battery, go from here!
Raj, you go.
You call me a double battery? Yes?
Raj, why are you late?
- I met those four headaches.
It seems that those
four heachaches...
...think you to be a Baburao.
- Baburao?
What is this now?
I haven't been able to tackle
battery till now...
...and you are giving
me another surname?
Did you bring my books?
- I have brought them. Take these.
It is such an item!
What a figure!
It seems she is coming towards us.
Can you tell me where the
principal's office is?
In which college were
you before this?
By the way, I asked about
the principal's office.
Go straight and inside. There
will be stairs there.
Go upstairs and left.
There will be...
...the principal's office
a little farther.
Please go!
I will come in too!
She is angry.
See. These are not good boys.
I will show you the...
...principal's office.
I am not like those.
Please come.
Move!
This is our principal.
Hey, Raj, what are you doing?
Look at this design. This
car will become like this.
This car will become like this?
Wow! You have made such a design.
It's good.
Yes. Sir is calling you.
Go and get you salary.
Fifteen... sixteen... seventeen...
eighteen...
This is your salary. - Yes. -
Sign here.
Papa, should I lift it?
- No. Manglu, lift the phone. - Yes.
Yes?
- This is your salary.
I have cut the money for
three days. - Why?
You were absent for three
weeks last month.
Don't you remember?
Yes... But I had to go
out with grandma.
You tell me something.
Are you paid for my service
or grandma's service?
Why are you staring at me
now? Go away. - Okay.
Yes, papa?
I had kept the curd milk in
the jug with ice to cool off.
Where has it gone?
There was a client here.
His car was hot.
I put it in his radiator
for coolness.
You put my curd milk
in his radiator?
There was nothing more cold.
So you should have
put my head in it.
I would have done that.
But your head is hot!
What if the radiator caught fire?
Explain this son of
a fool something!
Otherwise he will stay like a
used the outside the garage.
The fool!
Grandma!
Tell me. How was your
first day in college?
Grandma, is the first
day of college...
...and the last day of
school every good?
Yes, but seventy five percent
of my day was very good.
Why was the rest twenty
five percent bad?
Some of my seniors asked some
stupid questions to me.
Grandma, can I ask you something?
How do I look like?
I mean... do I look good?
Son, you are one in a million.
Please don't joke, grandma.
Think that you weren't
seventy but eighteen.
How would I look then?
Why are you talking about beauty
and complexion today?
Did you see some girl in college?
- How did you know that?
The boys of today are very smart.
They know that the girls of today...
...don't see their future
but their feature.
Who is that girl?
A girl has taken admission
in our college from London.
Quite some boys are waiting
to be friends with her.
Some of them troubled her
too. But I helped her.
I sent her to the
principal's office.
I understood what was seventy
percent nice in this day.
You like this girl, isn't it?
No, it's isn't like that.
See, I am not your mother,
I am your grandma.
And if I was eighteen year
old I would wish you...
...you to approach me and talk to me.
What are you staring at?
For what?
You left me to the principal's
office yesterday.
And I didn't even thank you.
Okay, I have to prepare some notes.
Even I have to prepare some notes.
Look at that.
How fortunate the library is...!
No, that rubber of the pencil.
If only, I would be that rubber.
All of you wait here and
see what Rocky does.
I have been searching you to
say sorry since yesterday.
The path to the principal's
office that I showed you...
...I told you right turn instead
of left turn by mistake...
...and you reached the gent's toilet.
As it is, some mischief is
tolerated in friendship, isn't it?
If you do any mischief
with me the next time...
...I won't complain
to the principal...
...but to the commissioner directly.
Even a professor must not have
scolded Rocky like this.
But you seemed more
scared than Rocky.
No, why will I be scared?
- Okay listen.
Our college came is going next week.
I have put your name in it too.
And you too are coming.
No friend. I can't come.
- Why?
There is a lot of work in the
garage. And uncle will shout!
Hey, your uncle always shouts.
Let him shout. My household
works because of him.
Okay, friend.
Your purse...
You here?
Your purse, it had fallen
down in the college.
But you could give this purse
to me tomorrow too. - I could.
But this purse had some your keys,
money and credit cards.
And it even had your
driving license.
I thought whether you would
be worried the whole night.
You took such a huge
risk for my worry?
What would something
have happened to you?
You have come to my house
for the first time.
You will have to drink tea.
What happened?
- Sometime else.
That means I will have to drop the
purse again, isn't it? - No!
I will surely come.
Are you hurt?
- No!
I will come to have some tea.
- Surely.
Why have you put this Tarzan?
I had put it in my childhood.
I thought that this car was Tarzan...
...and I had named it Tarzan too.
Tarzan was a man.
Yes, he was a man. But he had
a power like this machine.
Hey, boy!
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
Uncle, where did you
get this car from?
This is not a car. This is a wreck.
Anyone brings it from anywhere...
...and sells it according
to it's weight.
I want to buy it. How
much will it cost?
It must be a wreck worth
five thousand.
Five thousand?
I will give you five thousand.
But I don't have it right now.
I will take it after a week.
All this won't do. Talk
if you have cash.
It has half rotted already.
Uncle, the haste that
you have to sell it...
...I have a bigger haste to buy it.
This car belongs to my papa.
Just a week uncle, please?
Okay. But I won't keep
it for more than a week.
Thank me after a week.
Grandma...
- Yes? - Grandma! - Yes!
Hey, what is the matter?
You seem happier than seventy
five percent today.
My happiness doesn't have
any percentage today.
What is such that you got?
- Sit down at least.
What is the matter?
Grandma, you loved papa
a lot, isn't it?
You are asking a mother how
much she loves her son?
So you must be loving every
thing that papa had?
You ask this of yourself.
His color, character symbol,
whatever I have.
All that is you itself.
Why are you asking
me all this today?
Grandma, I need five
thousand rupees.
Five thousand rupees?
- Aren't they a lot?
Where have you asked a lot ever?
I have always have had
less to give you.
Why do you want them?
Grandma, I will buy such
a thing for you...
...Looking at which you
will be very happy.
Son, I become happy
looking at you happy.
See, my investments
will open next week.
I will take that and give
it to you. Okay?
You work here?
- It's a part time job.
Pocket money with training too.
- Yes.
Your nose!
- It is a bit different, isn't it?
It is similar to papa's.
- No, it has become black.
Just a minute, I will clean it.
Your papa's nose seems too good.
How did you come here?
I don't know. My car stops suddenly.
- I will rectify it right away.
It seems that you haven't serviced
your car since a long time.
I don't know. I never
saw it before this.
How do you do your studies
and part time job together?
I manage it.
- Doesn't this hamper your studies?
It does, but what can I do? There
isn't anyone to earn at home.
After my mom's demise in childhood,
I had my papa...
...and he expired in a car accident.
Do you stay alone now?
- No. I have my grandma with me.
Here, your car is rectified.
What is the cost?
- Money? What money?
I have just tightened a screw.
And you thanked me.
That is a lot itself. - No. You
will have to take the money.
At hour place, we don't charge
for tightening the screws.
If you ever have some
major work, don't...
...take any tension I will
do everything for free.
Bring your car sometime later,
I will have it serviced too.
If you do like this, I will stand
on the street and do like this.
What did you say to that girl?
If it is some major job,
you will do it for free?
You work taking thank you? Do it!
Instead of giving you money
in your envelope...
...while giving you your salary,
I will write a thank you to you.
But uncle...
- Shut up!
Why didn't you take
money from that girl?
Is this a charitable garage?
I pay fifteen mechanics
to tighten screws.
When a car enters in this garage,
the charge is five hundred rupees.
Uncle. I knew her.
If you knew her, go home
and tighten her screws.
If you tighten screws here,
I will loosen your screws.
Uncle, this thing won't repeat.
See. I will cut your
five hundred rupees.
And if you ever do something
like this...
...I will cut your whole
salary and sack you.
Go, go and work.
Yes, uncle.
Yes, uncle.
What are you doing?
Papa, I am putting
oil in the engine.
Oh! You son of an ass! This is not...
...the bottle of a engine oil. It
is the bottle of Roohafza sorbet.
Shut up!
Yes, uncle?
Close him in the boot of some car.
- But papa!
He has started opening bonnets.
How will I learn, papa?
- What are you learning?
You are putting all my eating
and drinks inside cars.
Don't see any difference
between car and Kartar?
Get lost from here!
See, Raj. You hide and look
at her in the library.
You risk your life to
return her purse.
And you repair her car for free.
And your expression says
that you like Priya.
If you do like here, then tell her.
See, it is the rose day tomorrow.
You go and offer her
a rose tomorrow.
If she does accept it, you
have got your answer.
And what if she doesn't?
She will throw the
rose at your face.
But you won't be insulted
by that, understood?
The idea is not that bad.
Only Miss Oxford is worthy
of giving a rose this year.
Will she take the rose? - Yes. -
She will take all our four roses.
- Yes?
Did you understand it?
- Yes, sir. - Now go.
See, the batter has come too.
See. What black and yellow
coat has he worn?
He looks like a taxi.
This yellow suit,
suites you very much.
Okay, listen. Look at that.
Go with confidence and
give her the rose.
Is this for me?
- Yes, it is for you.
How could you dare to
wish me rose day?
I befriended you thinking that
you were a simple boy...
...and you took this
meaning out of it?
I didn't know that these
cat eyes look...
...at me with this meaning
beneath these spectacles.
What are you hiding?
- Nothing.
Okay, come on. We will dance.
No, I don't know how to dance.
Which competition is going
on here? Come on!
But even then, I don't
know how to dance.
Hey, what's this!
The glass with the intoxication
pills has been taken by the battery!
The plan is ruined!
No, it is good.
The battery will be
intoxicated now...
...and he will act insolently
with her.
Now Miss Oxford will slap
him and put him to a side.
What happened, Raj?
- What happened?
I will tell you what happened
right now. - Come on.
I haven't come here to jog
wearing this yellow suit.
You asked me what I
was hiding, isn't it?
I was hiding this, this!
I started loving you when I saw you
for the first time in the college.
I started seeing you everywhere.
I became so worthless in your love...
...that I started to see
you in my grandma too.
Even then, I didn't have strength
to express my love.
Then my friend Vicky understood
my sickness.
Vicky said, ' Raj, love is not
silent, love is violent! '
Even I have become violent!
Hey, black crows...
If you love me, accept it,
or throw it on my face.
I will not be insulted. Even
this, my friend told me.
Now, whether you love me or not,
I will tell everybody!
'When I saw you, I felt like this.'
'The magic of love set in my heart.'
'The aroma was mixed in the air.'
'The heart beats got a romance.'
' My state was excited! '
'Without you... '
'Without you, I am not interested
in anything.'
'Without you... O beloved! O beloved!
' I stopped and refuse my heart,
but it didn't agree! '
'O beloved! O beloved! '
' Ever since I got your love,
this is going on.'
'There was some excitement
in these breaths, my love.'
' My beloved! My beloved! '
'Your dreams settled in
my eyes, my beloved! '
' I just ask God this now! '
' I should not leave
your embrace now.'
Hey, Raj. You here?
Grandma said that I said a lot
about you last night in my sleep.
You would have. You said
a lot in my presence too.
What did I say?
Sit in the car, I will tell you.
Do you know? You had drunk
a lot yesterday.
No. I haven't even touched
liquor till now.
I think that someone did
some mischief with me.
Someone had surely mixed
something in my drink.
Whoever did this mischief
did a good thing.
You seem so simple from inside...
...but you are a rascal from inside.
- Rascal?
Not a rascal and great rascal.
Do you know what you did?
You danced and made everyone
else dance too.
You dance very well.
But you did one mistake.
- What?
You know? You gave me your rose.
But you snatched your neighbor's
rose and gave me.
You expressed your love to
me in everyone's presence.
And that too under intoxication?
I didn't like this action of yours.
You expressed your love,
but under intoxication?
Love is expressed in all
sanity. Like this.
Did you understand?
I wanted to apologize to you
for yesterday's mistake.
I thought that our friendship
would be over today too.
But I have got you today.
- I had got you yesterday itself.
Today is a very happy day for me.
What I am going to buy
is my most loved thing.
Most loved thing?
- Stop the car.
What is here?
That loved thing is here itself.
Yes, let it come, let it come back.
Attach it quickly. Will
you take the whole day?
Hey, what are you doing,
where are you taking it?
To melt it and make it into
iron. I have bought it.
To melt it? But I was to buy it.
- I don't know that.
Go and talk to Patel about it.
Uncle, you sold this car!
You said that you would
buy it in a week.
It is the ten days today,
you didn't come.
But uncle, the money could be
arranged last night itself.
I came yesterday morning,
but you weren't there.
But it is sold now.
Take the car back from
him and give it to me.
Take it back? How will
I take it back?
He has given me the money.
He is my old client.
I will err in my counting. You
go. Let me count the money.
It is iron for you. But for me...
it is a priceless thing for me.
You take all my money and... please...
What is so special in this scrap
that you are so worried?
This isn't scrap, Priya.
This is my papa's car.
This is my papa's possession.
He loved it a lot.
Uncle, you want to make
iron out of a car.
Any car of scrap will do for you.
Please give me this car.
I beg you! I request you!
Take this money and
give me this car.
Okay, take this car.
Our work is to melt iron. Not
to melt anyone's emotions.
Give him this car.
Grandma?
Didn't I tell you that I would
bring something looking...
...at which you will be happy?
Look at this, Papa's car.
' I believe in you! '
Come on, mother. You sit here.
And you sit here.
One photo with my Tarzan.
Grandma...
For a moment, I thought
that you brought my son.
Yes, grandma.
When I saw it for the first time,
I thought that my papa was with me.
I will make it now, grandma.
I will design it.
I know that it will
cost a lot of money.
But I will work day
and night for it.
I will do overtime.
I will make it such a car
with my mechanical skills...
...and hard work that people
will be stunned.
Granda, this is Priya.
Greetings.
- Bless you.
This is the same London
one, isn't it?
About whom you were saying?
- Yes.
You go inside, I will come.
Who is there?
I am Raj, uncle.
Hey, you haven't gone home
so late in the night?
You haven't gone home?
- I am doing overtime.
If you do part time in the day
and overtime in the night...
...when will you do your studies?
I need money.
What is the matter? Is there
some problem in the house?
No, uncle.
Son, barring Lakshmi and Kuber
everyone needs money.
But what is so serious, for which...
...you are ready to leave
your studies too?
I had told you about my papa,
isn't it? He had a car.
I have got it after twelve years.
I want to make that car once again.
Son, the kids of nowadays throw
their parents from the house.
And you are doing such a sacrifice...
...to save your father's memoirs?
You make that car. I am
with you. And see son.
You are doing some part
time in my garage...
...you do that. Instead of the
over time in my garage...
...you spend that time
making your car.
I will pay you for the hours that
you put in making that car.
All of us are mechanics.
It is not only our profession
to rectify problems.
It is also our religion.
You didn't go to the camp?
When you did go there,
what will I do there?
I can't help you in
building the car.
But I can be with you, isn't it?
'You are my craze, you
are my ambition.'
'You exist in my breaths,
you are my heart.'
'You are the emotion attached
to my heart.'
' My name, my work... '
'Why did my heart beat
as soon as I saw you? '
' My hopes increased, there
was a dream in my eyes.'
'Our friendship is different
in this whole world.
'There is a procession of
memoirs at every curve.'
'The emotions are deep.
You and I know this.'
'The relation is very delicate.
You and I know this.'
Why are you tying this Tarzan?
- This car is named Tarzan.
Yes. My dad had named
this car Tarzan.
So, should we go on a
drive in this Tarzan?
No, Priya.
This car won't start now.
- Why?
It's fuel pump has jammed
because of rust.
I have tried a lot but
it didn't open up.
I have spoken to uncle. He
will arrange something.
Okay. Thank you.
What happened, uncle?
Son, I tried a lot.
I spoke to some...
...people who keep old cars,
I asked scrap dealers...
...nobody has it. That company...
...has even stopped making
cars of that model.
Therefore, son. It is difficult
to get that fuel pump.
Now, you can only believe in God.
Son, didn't you sleep?
I am not feeling sleepy, grandma.
Even after so much hard
work and tries...
...the fuel pump couldn't
be got. I think...
...that my Tarzan will
not be able to run now.
Why will it not be able to work?
If God didn't wish it, how
would you get this car?
He gave you strength to make
such a beautiful car.
Have faith in him. He will
show you some way out.
Sleep, son. Sleep.
Grandma!
The fuel pump is made, grandma!
My Tarzan has started, grandma!
Did you see that, son?
The fuel pump was made by
God's grace, isn't it?
There won't be such a
car in the whole world.
Bless you! Bless you!
Wow! What a car!
Hey, this is not a car.
This is great!
I haven't seen such
a car in my dreams!
Hey! This is the battery!
And he has Miss Oxford with him too.
This is my papa's favorite
restaurant.
Why, grandma? Didn't papa bring
you here often? - Yes, son.
Hey, how did this happen?
From a cycle to a car
all of a sudden?
I see Miss Oxford's support in this.
Battery's state and face,
both have changed.
He snatched the morsel
from our mouth.
He is showing off a lot.
Today, we will change his face.
Come on!
That's strange, battery.
You have become Pran
from Kanhayalal.
Is it Miss Oxford's backing,
or dad's insurance?
You made this fool a foreigner.
Don't do this two much and
three much in front of us.
Or I will change the close
up of your face.
What insolence is this? Leave her!
- Shut up! Old woman!
Raj, no! Wait Raj!
Grandma, he has insulted you!
I will show them how
much is two and two.
I won't spare him!
- Leave me!
Wait!
Wait! Or else I will have
to call the police.
Mother, you please take him.
C'mon, dear - Wait!
We are going. That's
it. We are going.
Leave us.
Wait!
Where are you going? Are you
getting scared and running?
Where are you hiding with women?
If you have the guts, come out!
He has run away! That wretch!
Don't worry.
We will break him and
his car tomorrow...
...morning, outside the college.
The battery has insulted
us a lot today.
If the guards hadn't
come in between...
...I would have made
such a state of his...
...he wouldn't have faced
us throughout his life.
Hey, who is there? Shut
down the light!
Hey, shut down the light!
Hey, it is battery.
It seems that he is unlucky. He has
come in the lion's claws himself.
Come on, we will settle
his hands and legs.
As it is, there isn't
any lame student...
...in the college who
comes on crutches.
Hey wait! Hey wait!
Hey, where are you running!
Hey! Catch him! Fast.
C'mon, hurry up!
Where are you hiding, you coward?
There he is. Behind that pillar.
Catch him. Don't let him escape.
- You Battery, wait there. Come out.
Hey catch him.
- Where are you running to?
Break its glass.
- But how?
Throw your helmet into it.
He thinks he's a hero. Catch him.
- We'll break his legs today.
Why do you run, stop.
- I will break your limbs today.
Maxi, catch him. Vicky,
don't let him get away.
Stop!
Are we chasing him
or he's chasing us?
How did he come behind us?
I am running out of gas.
Hey you, son of a dog!
Do you think you are very
smart sitting inside?
Just come outside then you'll see
how I break you hands and legs.
Hey, Battery threw
him in the gutters.
He'll die.
- Someone should save him.
You should go.
- No, you should go.
You should go.
- You should go.
Hey, go now.
Bunty, are you alive?
- Yes, I'm alive.
Open it, quickly. It stinks in here.
Just hold your breath,
I'll be right there.
Help me.
I never thought, that Battery...
...would turn out to be
so dangerous. - Yes.
What are you doing up there?
- Come down soon.
Where is Battery?
What is this shh?
Why are you banging your head?
Can't you speak, you baldy?
Have you become dumb?
Baldy, get down. Got dumb? And
why are you crying?
Have you gone mad? Where
is that Battery?
Run!
Get inside!
There!
Hey, what are you doing?
- My hands are stuck.
Who is it? - I think someone
is coming. Hide here.
Run!
We are stuck! Pull!
How did you two get in?
Hello uncle. We two got stuck
to each other. Please, help us.
You spilled all my fevicol? - No,
we didn't. It got spilled by itself.
We are stuck together. Separate us.
Now I'll stick you
two in such a way...
...as we stick ply to wood.
Enough Raj, don't come ahead.
Or else the car will run over us.
No Raj. - You have squeezed
out our hooliganism.
And only we know from
where it came out.
No Raj. We didn't know that
if we say something...
...to your granny then you'll
become so violent.
Please, spare us, Raj.
- Forgive us, Raj.
Please, we beg of you.
- Forgive us, Raj.
We'll never do this again.
We are sorry.
We are saved.
We had so much of fun.
Raj? What a car Raj has brought!
I've never even seen
such a car in books.
I made this car after
thinking that only.
Your whole life is set, pal.
After finishing college...
...you start your own workshop.
And design such...
...beautiful cars in it. Just
watch as all the automobile...
...companies will have to
pull down their shutters.
Raj, if you meet Rocky
and his friends...
...then just stay away from them.
- Why?
Any problems?
- Yes.
Brother Raj!
- Brother Raj!
Brother Raj, please forgive us.
What has happened to you all?
Didn't brother Raj
tell you anything?
What would I tell? I
don't know anything.
You don't know? Even we don't know.
We all have forgotten everything.
You didn't kill us, isn't
that a big favor itself?
Raj, did you do all this?
- Forget it, sister Priya.
With the evil intentions
we use to see you...
...now we'll never see
you that way again.
If any of our eyes survive
then we'll see...
...you mother with one eye
and sister with the other.
If we had one more eye
then we would have...
...saw you as grandmother.
But we don't have any.
Did you see? This happens when...
...a decent guy looses his decency.
A decent guy loosing his
decency and becomes...
...so dangerous, this is the
first time I have ever seen.
Our hearts came up to our necks.
You just say it once that go
away dogs, I forgive you.
C'mon Raj, forgive them.
C'mon now go into the class.
And don't let me watch you.
Thank you, brother.
- May God always bless you.
Just take care of yourself.
- Yes, move. C'mon!
Yes Mr. Narang.
You run your bulldozers
on their slums...
...without any worries.
I want that land to
be cleared in a week.
I'm coming to Palghar tomorrow.
We'll discuss the rest there itself.
Where are you getting the
bulldozers to run over?
In a slum at Palghar.
I'm constructing a two-wheeler
factory there on your name.
Ladybird bicycle and moppet
company. Did you like it?
This Four Fox company
will soon shut down.
And my partners are thinking
of starting...
...a business in poultry
and garments.
That's why I thought, in your name...
...I would bring up our
own empire and...
...then throw my partners out
within 2-4 years. Let's go.
Raj!
- Yes, uncle.
Raj, go to Mr. Singhania's house.
He's having car troubles.
Uncle, Mr. Deepak's car's
windscreen need to be changed.
And we have to deliver it today.
- I'll get that changed from Manglu.
You take the towing car with you.
If Mr. Singhania's car doesn't
gets fixed till evening...
...then tow it to the garage. Go.
- Yes.
Hey Golu.
- Yes papa.
Go and tell Manglu to change Mr.
Deepak's car's windscreen.
Which one should be fitted? Of
the fiat or of the ambassador?
You mad fellow, how can you
fix some other windscreen?
It can happen, papa. Lots of
people do this to save money.
For example as today the fan belt
of D'souza's car was broken.
So I told him, it'll
cost him Rs.110.
But he said, no. He said
to use something cheaper.
So do you know, I have attached
your pant's belt to it! - What?
Yes. In the evening when you
wear it then you'll see...
...that your pants would
keep on sliding down.
Hey Manglu!
- Yes uncle.
Manglu, take him and lock
him inside the house.
Or else he'll get my garage
shut down. Take him. - C'mon.
Welcome, Mr. Chopra. Seeing
you after such a long time.
Uncle, the headlights of my car
are broken. Just change it.
I have to go to Palghar and
return by night today.
By the ways Mr. Chopra,
it's believed that...
...it's lucky when glass breaks.
I think you'll have a
very lucky day today.
These are all superstitions,
Mr. Singh.
If this was possible
then I would have...
...lived in a glass house. And
would have messed with...
...every crazy man carrying a stone.
If he believes it's lucky
then it becomes lucky.
If he believes it's unlucky
then it becomes unlucky.
Let's see, what happens.
Come Mr. Chopra. Until we fix your
car lets sit in the office.
