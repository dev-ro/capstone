Our country gets spoiled
by old people only.
They are getting confused
to take a decision.
lf you ask me...
There'd be a law to dismiss
workers above 50 years...
Then only our country
will get good state.
lf we appoint freshers,
office will get spoiled.
Youngsters only can
take decision quickly.
50 years old man can't
take quick decision.
Shall l call everybody

He likes youths like you.
Everybody likes me. Except me.
Why? Put down.
What's your name? Chandran.
lt's not enough to him.
Ok. A.A.K. Chandran.

Should l tell my name

Tear & throw it in the dustbin.
You'd show that you're
not interested in games.
He thinks that these

We sold his principles.
Should we sell his dress too?
Do you have cotton shirt & dhothi?
This is the election time.
There is a demand. Come after 10 days.

year you took birth?
ln 1958. Who is the
congress leader in 1958?
That's not me. Then. You can't get job.
You can go home. What's
the doll in your shirt?
That's cat, sir. What's
the proud in that?
He wore a dress like an acrobat.
Why didn't he wear a lion doll shirt?
He'd be ugly at that time too.
Greets Subramaniyabharathi.
lf we hear your name...
Children will get patriotism.
Do you know to write poems?
l don't have that habit.
Can't you pronounce properly?
l feel difficult to say.
So you can't talk with
proper pronounciation.
Ok. l am going to tell one
thing. Can you tell again?
A stick in a bunch of
stick, is bended stick.
Tell me. No sir. That's risky.
You can't talk with
proper pronounciation.
But your name is Subramaniyabharathi.
You are doing treachery
to him & his country.
Change your name first.
Short name is Suppi.
Whatever it is? Get out.

My native is Ayyampettai...
My dad's name is
Ariyudainambi Kaliyaperumal...
My name is Chandran. l'll
tell inculding these 3...
You came to interview.
You have long mustache.
Mustache will reflect
our soul, heart & all...
People may forget them
& not their mustache.
lf anybody has a long mustache...
They are very honest...
That's my small opinion...
Do you have any interest in sports?
lf l get time & my parents
permit me, l'll play.
Do you know about
Blackpearl? l saw white pearl.
l mean world famous foot
ball player Blackpearl.
World famous...? l
didn't hear about him.
We'd spend our time to
recreation in our hardwork...
We'd not give time to recreation...
l understood my dad's
wrong principles now only.
l leave, sir. Sit. What
else did your dad teach you?
He told many things.
My dad told me as lndian
& Tamilian only after that.
Have you worn cotton
dress for that only?
lf we look in financial view...
An lndian family will
get food once by my dress.
Ok. You are wearing
small & very tight...
lf you wear it in large size...
An lndian family will
get food for 2 times.
Lot of lndians don't have dress too.
We'd wear dress for our
honor & not to show richness.
Nagesh told like that.
Who is that Nagesh?
Didn't you hear about
him? lt's a wonder.
Who is such a great person?
He is a great man, who
lived in A.D. 1 765...
l read this in his book.
You'd need recommendation
to join in this company.
Do you have that? Sir...
l don't want this job
with recommendation.
Wait man. You are
getting angry like Nehru.
You have lot of principles
in this young age.
You are telling answers
without any fear.
l like you very much. Take your seat.
Don't fear for others.
Nobody is genius than you.
Like that nobody is least than you.
So don't under estimate anybody...
My dad taught this to
me. This is my principle.
See. l got excited. Who is your dad?
A great man struggled with Gandhi...
Did you hear about him? No.
He is my dad, then.
Ariyudainambi Kaliyaperumal.
l didn't see that genius.
That's my bad luck.
Sir. That's my luck.
Why? lf you had heard
about him already...
l'd have not got this
oppourtunity to tell about him.
You have joined in this job.
lf a Vivekandar lives in
every houses like you...
Do you know how good
this country will be?
You wait outside. l'll

lf you don't have job,
nobody will respect you.
He is talking. You
have a matured sister.
You'd make her marriage.
That's your duty.
Mind that.
My tongue will get spoiled lying a lot.
Nothing wrong in lying.
Valluvar told us already.
We'd maintain that clearly.
We can lie to reach a good position.
We'd not cheat anybody. That's all.
No sir. l am going to resign this job.
Don't see my face. Go away.
What do you tell? Ok.
Come to my way.
Good boy.
Open your mouth. Where

People think to finish their
work in the over time...
How are you indifferent?
We'd finish our work

Then what man? Then only everything...
He told me to send my younger brother.

pay salary. That's all.
l understood one thing
about your boss. What?
He'll provide food. How
saying? See your belly.

You are very brilliant.
You called me old man &
thought me as a gardener...
l know that you are
trying to apologize to me.
lt's ok. Take your seat.
lf a man pour water to
plants with sweating...
People will think that
he is the gardener.
You should not do that
job for your richness.
That's your mistake. Why
should l apologize to you?
l told you as an old
man. l can tell now too.
Old man.
That is true.
You are very frank.

daughter. l've decided.
