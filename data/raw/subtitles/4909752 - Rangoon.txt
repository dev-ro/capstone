As World War II rages,
the whole world is
engulfed in flames of war.
India is under British rule
and at present,
the freedom struggle is at its peak.
In Gandhi's non-violent struggle,
the call for self-rule
echoes throughout the country.
But another soldier
of this battle for freedom,
Subhash Chandra Bose,
is dismissive
about Gandhi's non-violent ways.
He believes that freedom has
to be fought for, not sought after.
It will be attained
by fighting fire with fire.
Bose changed his strategy
and joined hands
with the enemy of the enemy, Japan.
He assumed command of the
Indian National Army in Singapore.
The Indian National Army or INA.
Was formed with prisoners of war
who were captured
while fighting for the British.
But the British Army still had
thousands of Indian soldiers
who are shedding their blood
for their ruthless masters,
the British.
Nawab!
Hurry up, Nawab!
Hurry UP!
Nawab, run!
Nawab, hurry!
Nawab!
Nawab, c'mon, try harden. hurry!
Nawab!
Nawab!
'India can no longer
remain enslaved.'
'We'll have to pay
the price for freedom!'
'Prepare for it.'
'We may've been born
in an enslaved India'
'but we'll breathe our last
in a free India.'
Sir, General Mutaguchi's orders.
The Japanese army is
to lead the attack, not us.
Our army, our mission,
both are irrelevant to the Japanese.
No one can stop us
from reaching Delhi now.
Neither the British, nor the Japanese.
Prepare for war.
The first stop will be here,
at Imphal.
In two months,
we will hoist the tricolor there.
And in four months.. in Delhi.
But, Sir, to fight our battle,
we'll need guns,
explosives, tanks, transport.
And for those, money.
We will arrange for the money.
Pardon me sir,
but from where?
Bombay.

Extraordinary. Stunning. Incredible.
This was a bit tight.
- OK!
Haseena, you were brilliant today.
You overshadowed Julia.
Why did you pull my hair so hard?
In the next shot,
Julia on a bike with horses chasing her
and then an airplane.
- Perfect.
And then you decide“
- One more!
Julia, why one more?
The last one was so good.
Rusi, what the hell? It's a classic
one-shot and I'm okay with it.
People watch films, not shots.
And who is the director of this film?
Good question.
You know how scarce film stock is.
The world is at war and you are
bent upon getting 'one more'!
Go and join Hitler's army!
The chandelier?
It's impossible to grab
the chandelier mid-air, Rusi.
Really?
What if something happens to me?
I don't want to die
before becoming Mrs. Billimoria.
You are Julia.
Miss Julia.

May I have your attention please?
Your royal highnesses, my lords,
ladies and gentlemen, good evening.
There's someone very special
I'd like to introduce to you tonight.
He's here straight from the battlefield,
where he's fighting for us
and with us.
No one makes a better
Mutton Biryani than him
and I'm proud
to call him my friend.
To his ennobling empire
and to the good
that it has done our country.
To Major General David Harding!
Greetings!
I'm reminded of a couplet.
"He has become the King's comrade,
and hence shows off arrogantly."
"He has become the King's comrade,
and hence shows off arrogantly."
"What other claim to respect does
'Ghalib' have in the city?"
Well said!
Thank you, Mr. Billimoria.. Rusi.
I'm honored.
I may be a White man
on the outside, friends.
But this heart,
it is Indian.
Ms. Julia,
please meet my new queen, Padmini.
I heard your real name is not Julia.
It is a.. I don't know,
I mean, I read it somewhere“
Excuse me.
- Your drink, Your Grace.
Actresses!
'Every Indian has a duty
towards this country.'
'Hence, he must
contribute his due share
towards the final victory.'
'I'm convinced that
India cannot hope to be free
until all Indians living abroad
perform their duties
in this momentous world crisis.'
'Hail free India!'
- Hail the motherland!
Whom do we follow? Who is right?
Gandhi preaches non-violence.
And Mr. Bose advocates violence.
You aren't fit for either.
We must attain freedom,
whenever that will be. - Correct.
This is a memento of
my first and late wife, Rajo.
Netaji, Rajo's last memento.
For the Indian National Army.
This is from me.
- Splendid!
Do you not miss the screen,
Mr. Billimoria?
No more than I miss this hand.
Rusi, our boys on the front
would love to see Ms. Julia.
Just a few shows
for our Indian troops.
There's a war going on, David.
It's far too dangerous.
Oh, there's no danger at all.
The Japanese are on the run.
And it's bad times for the INA.
Their guns and bellies“
Both are empty!
I give you my word,
Miss Julia will have better
protection than the King of England.
My word above my life!
Is this what you've
been learning in Benaras?
Ms. Julia, we meet again.
Yes, my dear Queen No. 3!
Actually,
these ladies don't believe me.
Tell me, isn't it true that
you were a gypsy
before joining the movies?
And your real name is..
I forgot it again!
Jwala Devi“ it was Jwala Devi.
And I'm a bastard.
I don't know who my father is.
But I know
who my husband is going to be.
Soon I'm going to be Mrs. Billimoria.
Rusi, tell them.
Let's go, darling.
The press is waiting outside.
Excuse me.
- Of course.
I told you!
Mrs. Billimoria, huh!
All hail the King!
That's quite a sword!
Should I gift it to you
or would you like to snatch it?
Your Majesty,
you've a great sense of humor.
Careful, sir.
She's known as
the 'Queen of Panipat'.
It's very sharp.
Your King Edward VII
was smitten by this beauty.
I see.
But Your Majesty,
just for my curiosity,
how much is this sword worth?
Let's just say that
if I send this to
the Indian National Army,
then Boss's army can get
whatever they need
to free India from you.
In that case,
I may just have to snatch it.
Please stand back.
Ms. Julia, your film has completed
25 weeks, how do you feel about it?
Ms. Julia, what's the name
of your next film?
Ms. Julia, who is the hero
of your next film?
Bloody hell!
Bloody hell!
Ms. Julia,
you're a hero in reel life.
But who is your hero in real life?
Who is that lucky man?
The nation wants to know.
Rusi.
RUSI BILLIMORIA DECLARES
HIS LOVE FOR MS. JULIA
Cyrus, let's go.
Mummy, please, just a while longer.
- I said, let's go, dear.
Daddy, tell her.
- It's OK.
Hello Zen, how are you?
The same as I was
when you left“ happy.
Daddy, who's this?
Tell me, who is this?
Tell me, who is this.
Your daddy's mistress.
Daddy, what's a mistress?
Love is never deliberate, grandpa.
It just happened.
You were an action star, Rusi.
When did you become a romantic hero?
Forgive me, grandpa.
”One times two makes two.”
”Two times two makes four.”
”One times two makes two.”
"Two times two makes four."
”Four times four makes sixteen!”
”Praise the lord! My heart
crows aloud, cock-a-doodle-do!”
"Listen to it, cock-a-doodle-do!"
'listen to it. . ”
”I'm the lover,
you're the love interest!”
”One times makes three,
Three times makes nine!"
It's not easy for me to refuse
David, but I'm sorry, Major.
I can't risk Julia's life knowingly.
Mr. Billimoria..
Please trust us.
- This one.
This is the frame, take it out.
Sorry? What were you saying?
Nothing.
Britishers, leave India!
Britishers, leave India!
Britishers, leave India!
Long live revolution!
Britishers, leave India!
Britishers, leave India!
The country has gone insane.
If the British leave,
we'll be ruined.
Parrot.
- What?
You're Rusi's parrot.
But it's true!
We can keep protesting and fasting,
but no one is going anywhere.
Britishers, leave India!
Someone is definitely
going somewhere!
You knew?
No.
MISS JULIA TO ENTERTAIN
TROOPS AT BURMA BORDER.
I'm not going to Burma!
Come here.
Come, come“
Hey kiddo!
You didn't even ask me once.
Gemini Pictures has shut down.
Madras Talkies' new film
has been stalled halfway.
Why?
- It's wartime, kiddo.
Germany. . Hitler. .
Hitler watches Hindi movies?
It's the raw stock, my stupid kiddo.
Germany used to supply earlier,
they stopped it due to the war.
Now it comes from England.
So?
- So..
No show, no film.
No film, no Julia.
Sergeant Hukum Singh, sir!
I killed 6 Italian
soldiers in Egypt.
Beautiful.
Sergeant Chandra Bhaan Singh, sir!
9 German soldiers and a Major in Libya.
Very beautiful.
Sergeant Nawab Malik, Sir!
I didn't kill any enemy soldiers.
Sir, he was a POW.
Captured in Rangoon.
A former Chindit.
Did you escape a Japanese prison?
- Sir!
Without killing any Japanese?
I killed 27 traitors of
the Indian National Army. Sir!
Splendid, splendid, splendid!
By god, it's unbelievable!
Rusi.. Rusi, come. Come on!
Come in.
What happened?
- Grandpa suffered a heart attack.
What?
- I have to stay back.
I won't go alone.
- Kiddo, please understand.
Rusi, I won't go alone! Rusi!
Ms. Julia, please.
Hey, leave me!
Ms. Julia, please!
Who are you?
- No, Julia quiet.
What happened to Julia?
What's the chaos?
Who are you? Introduce yourself.
Sergeant Nawab Malik.
I'm in charge of
Ms. Julia's personal security.
I'll make sure that
you end up in housekeeping,
if it's the last thing I do!
- Calm down, Julia.
Calm her down.
Is he an actor or a soldier?
- Who is he?
What happened? Julia..
Weird!
I'm going to pee,
wanna join me?
Ladies only.
You're so stubborn.
Everyone warned you
about doing that stunt.
You know it wasn't my fault.
It was mine.
I should have stopped
you then.
Like I did today.
BY Wing to me.
No.
By hiding the truth.
Zenobia wants a divorce.
That cannot happen
as long as I'm alive.
What do you want?
The End.
We are terminating Julia's contract.
She's the biggest
star of this studio.
There are dozens of Julias
on every street of India.
Find another.

- OK, sir?
Tighten the nuts and bolts quickly.
Tighten that one.
My sincere apologies, Miss
Julia. It was the wild elephants.
Anyway, we have arranged for rafts.
Once we cross the river",
it's only 15 minutes to base-camp.
And to get to the river?
- Half an hour.
BY foot?
My donkey is at your service.
He told me that he's a sergeant.
Make way! Move aside, please!
Keep moving!
Let go. I can ride a stupid donkey.
It's a she..
Yes, this ass here is a woman.
Sergeant!
- Sir!
You go on ahead.
I'll escort Ms. Julia.
Sir!
I'm no less than Julia,
she's my junior.
I don't care“
I can't walk,
I want a donkey right now!
Of course, Queen Victoria.
Why don't we ask King George
to send you his private plane?
Shut up, Julia's pimp!
Oh really? See if I help
when you need your mustache waxed.
Beauty with a mooch!
You're not going on this.
Why not?
- Well..
This is Ms. Julia's raft.
OK, alright.
Take this.
Julia, hereafter,
this White man is your butler.
Take care of her.
Malik!
- Sir!
You'll go with Ms. Julia.
C'mon, let's get on it.
It's getting late.
My fairness cream, please.
It's in the bag.
Makes you radiant like the moon,
white like snow.
Want some?
I'm fine the way I am.
It's because you're a man.
Had you been a woman,
you'd have known
what it means to be
dark-skinned in this country.
Yes. No wonder we are
slaves to the Whites.
Miss Julia! C'mon here.
Miss Julia! C'mon quick.
Someone save my luggage!
Hey!
It was a disaster I'm afraid, sir.
I personally tried to
save as many as I could but“
I'm afraid, there are 27 dead.
A few locals, 13 of our men.
And there are four unaccounted for.
Including..
That's OK. Keep moving.
Including?
Zulfi!
Ahuja!
Rusi!
Hello!
Julie.
Miss Julia.
I do action..
Action“ dance“
'Daughter of the storm'..
"My lover went to England.."
"..he mustn't startle Hitler.."
"My lover went to England.."
"..to teach them a lesson.."
What's your name?
Name?
- Hiromichi.
What?
Hiromichi.
Hiro? I'm a heroine.
We go to India.
Tell..
Tell us the way.
Tell or else“
Or else“ he“ he'll kill you.
He'll kill you.
What?
What do you mean?
- Overacting!
Very funny, eh!
Why don't you try?
How do you know Japanese?
I was a POW.
Where?
- First in Rangoon, then Singapore.
For how long?
- Eight months.
How did you get out?
- I escaped.
Escaped? How?
What will it take
to get you to shut up?
Women!
Women!
Lucky throw!
We'll take turns keeping an eye on him.
You can sleep first.
I can't. I'm too hungry.
Hey!
That's enough.
Get back!
You would have done the
same if you were in his place.
If he'd rung that bell,
you'd be on that crucifix,
snoring away to glory.
And who'd be responsible for that?
You and your useless army.
'I'm in charge of
your personal security,
Sergeant Nawab Malik!'
And that dog, Major General Harding!
'Miss Julia, we will provide you
with better security
than the King of England.'
I'm going to take a nap.
If you get sleepy, shoot yourself in
the head, you'll wake up. Bloody hell!
Why did you flee?
When will it stop raining!?
37 minutes past 4.
How do you know?
Because I'm God.
As I know everything.
I know when the sun will set,
when the moon will rise,
when the wind will blow,
when the rain will stop
and when you will stop talking.
Why does God make
beautiful women so foolish?
What if it rains for days?
Will we just wait around?
Yes.
That's too much for me.
Explaining something to you is as tough
as making an elephant wear undies.
Let's go.
Come on, Hiro. We're leaving.
Both of you can rot here.
I'll find my way.
I won't stop.
I'm still going.
I've been performing
dangerous stunts since I was a kid.
Tightrope walking,
knife acts, fire-breathing.
At the beach,
I was paid a penny every week.
I was 14..
When Rusi first saw me perform,
at the beach.
He immediately bought me off
my mother for a thousand rupees.
Have you even seen a thousand rupees?
I swear!
Rusi educated me,
raised me and made me a star.
I am what I am because of him.
What's so funny about that?
It's the truth.
He'll do anything for me.
Hey, wait!
Once you dive into that dimple,
deeper and deeper you
fall into the mystery.
Dance away to the chime of the anklets,
I can't dance.
You can march, can't you?
Left, right, left.
Hold my waist.
Why so shy, Sergeant?
You've seen me naked.
Stark naked.
Tell me something.
Something that..
You have never told anyone else.
I'm afraid.
Afraid? Being a soldier?
Of what? Death?
No, of love.
Your turn.
I'm..
An untouchable.
That scar on your back?
It's beautiful.
How did you get it?
It's a heart wrenching story.
You won't tell anyone, will you?
Actually“
it's a birthmark.
Do you know why God makes
beautiful girls so foolish?
Why?
He makes them beautiful
so that men like you
can fall in love with them.
And foolish?
So they can fall in
love with men like you.
Hey!
I submit!
I submit!
Submit!
- Yes“
Aye!
Hey!
Nawab!
Hiro..
What are you doing?
I thought we were friends.
Farewell!
Kiddo!
It's Julia!
Farewell it is, surely not goodbye
The body is surely
not bereft of the sou!
You who flow through the soul
You who flow through the soul
You are not God, are you
Farewell it is, surely not goodbye
Take him to the jeep.
How is she? Any serious injuries?
- No, sir.
She's fine.
- Thank god.
Sergeant Malik.
- Sir!
Well done, soldier.
Ms. Julia told me all
about your heroic actions.
Thank you so much, sir.
- Please come and have some tea.
Oye Nawab, you dog.. You're alive?
It'll take a lot more to kill me!
Hello everybody! Ahuja!
Poor girl!
Why haven't you informed your family
you survived Rangoon?
Your mother thinks
the Japanese killed you.
They're preparing for
your death anniversary, inform them.
Yes, I'll write to her.
Not a letter, send a telegram.
Come along.
My stomach's growling.
- Come, I'll get you fed.
When you went missing, I realised
that I don't love you.
Had you told me earlier,
I wouldn't have come back.
Love is too small a word.
Without you,
I have no reason to live.
What an ugly scan.
I hate it.
There's a new English Doctor in Bombay.
A cosmetic surgeon.
He can remove it.
How's grandpa?
He must be fine.
- What about the stroke?
It was a lie.
To keep me away from you.
Huh?
You can't plan love.
It just happens.
I've put in my divorce papers.
I am starting my new studio.
And a new life.
Oh, it's a wound.
Wear it once this heals.
It won't heal anytime soon.
Are you mad? It'll hurt you.
It should hurt.
How else will I know
this is not a dream?
Safety, utmost importance! Please!
Rusi, General Slim has deployed
five anti-aircraft guns,
especially for Miss Julia.
Every road that leads to Burma
now has a British post.
Not even a bird
could fly over to this side now.
Ah Sergeant Malik!
At ease.
Mr. Billimoria wanted to see you.
Thank you, Sergeant.
- It was my duty, sir.
You saved not one but two lives.
Anything I can do to return the favour?
- Thank you, sir.
Anything?
- It's really not necessary.
Sergeant Malik,
on Miss Julia's personal request,
I'm recommending you
for the Victoria Cross.
Thank you, Miss Julia.
You deserve it, Nawab.
That will be all, Sergeant.
Wait, here.
Have some opium.
'Akbari Afeem'.
Be careful, David.
Why? What happened?
An epidemic.
There's a disease spreading.
Malaria? Drink a tea
made of cloves and cinnamon.
You can escape malaria, David.
But there's no
escaping a case of Julia.
What?
Poor Sergeant Malik. He's dead!
And so am I!
What a bad joke, Rusi!
And David, you seem just fine.
'On seeing her, my face brightens.'
Ms. Julia..
'On seeing her, my face brightens
and shrouds my illness.'
Very good, David!
- Thank you.
This fellow here..
he's very good at heart.
I'll never forgive god
for playing this joke on me!
He made the poor fellow mute.
When I was born“
And him..
Zulfi, costumes! Zulfi?
Where is Zulfi?
He hasn't come by all day!
Is he dead or what?
Maybe.
- What?
Don't be naive.
Everybody knows that
he was swept away in the river
trying to save your precious costumes.
Brace yourselves!
Listen to the call of these wild doves!
Julia! Julia!
She isn't ready yet?
Shall we cancel the show?
Zulfi..
The army is looking for him.
They'll find him
just as they found you.
Come on. Everyone's waiting.
I can't.
What have I always told you?
The show must...?
Must“?
Go on.
- ..go on.
My Julia.
But what am I going to wear?
Bloody he!!!
Bloody he!!!
I, the walking,
walk, walk, walk!
Walk, walk, walk!
He, the talking,
talk, talk, talk!
Talk, talk, talk!
I, the walking,
walk, walk, walk!
Walk, walk, walk!
He, the talking,
talk, talk, talk!
Talk, talk, talk!
I said good good morning
Good morning
Good morning
Blimey! On my palms
he placed a golden ring
Boy! Round and round
Yes round and round
I wobbled on my feet, dizzy
Mumbling no-no and sorry
Fell in love/made love, English-style
Mumbling no-no and sorry
Fell in love/made love, English-style
And openly sipped the
wine of those lips English-style
When suddenly rang a bell
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!!
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!!
Mumbling no-no and sorry
Fell in love/made love, English-style
And openly sipped the
wine of those lips English-style
When suddenly rang a bell
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!!
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!! He!!! He!!!
Draped in a suit
And in nifty boots
Draped in a suit
And in nifty boots
He was in a parachute
He was in a parachute
Flying off here and there, carrying
the earth with him to the sky
No, I did not leave him
Nor did I break his heart
He got himself into a tangle
the gentleman, the good man
He got himself into a tangle
the gentleman, the good man
he was crazy
and I was lazy
His eyes gently uttered
my name in English.
And openly sipped the
wine of those lips English-style
When suddenly rang a bell
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!!
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!! He!!! He!!!
Is there a tiger here
who can take on Miss Julia?
Who will be Miss Julia's prey tonight?
Me! Me! Me!
Oh David,
your life is far too important.
What if I miss?
I need someone
whose life can be sacrificed.
How about you, Sergeant Nawab Malik?
Where are you?
The magic of his eyes
like a knife out of control
Who was she?
- Mama.
My Mama.
He got himself into a tangle
the gentleman, the good man
He got himself into a tangle
the gentleman, the good man
From the right and the left
From all flanks as the attacks came,
English-style
Even as he fell,
Held on to me, English-style
And openly sipped
the wine of those lips English-style
When suddenly rang a bell
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!!
Bloody hell!
Bloody he!!!
He went that way.
Stop Zulfi!
Don't harass me.
- Zulfi!
Hey“ stop!
Or I'll jump into the well.
Zulfi, listen to me.
- No!
Come down.
- No.
You lied! You said that
the Japanese were with us.
Yes, they are with us.
- Oh really?
Then why did they attack us?
Such big..
- Hey Zulfi!
They dropped such big bombs!
Because we were at the
wrong place at the wrong time.
Come.
- No.
I'm warning you, Nawab.
Or I'll really jump.
- Alright, I'm leaving.
OK, do whatever you want.
I'll really jump.
- At least take this opium.
Oh, another lie?
I got this for you, 'Akbari Afeem'.
What is that?
- It's very good, smell it.
I'll smell it from there itself.
- Are you a clog?
I've been smoking for ages.
Yes, stand back.
- OK, you take it.
Fine, I'll take it.
- Take it.
Nawab, just let me go.
You said I'd have to watch
the trunk only till the first show.
Then I'm free.
Are you mad?
I've explained it to him
a hundred times since this morning.
I'll say it again.
Since the attack,
the Brits have become much more alert.
The last show is at Singhghat camp.
From there,
the trunk can safely be taken
to the other side
via the river.
Then why don't you
hide it in your ambulance?
Between your injections and medicines.
Look, Zulfi..
You know it'll be safest with Julia.
No one would suspect her.
Here.
YOU have to return tomorrow.
I'll brief you on where to go
and what to say.
Meaning?
I'm not going back
into the jungle alone. - Zulfi..
No way, that's impossible!
- Of course, it is.
You have the opium.
This 'Akbari Afeem' isn't burning.
What will I do?
Smoke a joint with wild bears?
On the contrary, they will fear you.
Yeah“
You're no less than a lion
after a hit of this.
No less than a lion, eh!
I'm not going anywhere.
Take this.
Look, Zulfi, all our hopes
and dreams are hidden in this box.
Don't let us down.
?Singing the INA anthem?
'If you must shed blood,
shed it for your motherland,
not for her enemies.'
'Go back.
But work for the INA. '
'We have a mission.'
'A highly prized sword.'
'In exchange,
we'll receive ammunition for our war.'
'That sword will lead
our nation to freedom.'
'That sword will break
the shackles of slavery.'
Mail has arrived!
Baldev, mail has arrived!
This medicine is for you?
And this letter. .
For the other side.
- OK, fine.
'Keep this bag down and pick that up!'
Furthermore“
Sir!
' Yes?
Captain Nawab Malik.
The package is safe.
We will meet
on the full moon night.
Hail India!
What's the 'unwan' of your next film?
Unwan? What's that?
Title.. what's the
title of your next film?
'Queen of the Express'.
- 'Queen of the Express'?
And what's it about?
It's a thriller, David. A heist.
Stealing from a running train. - Wow!
'Queen of the Express'!
Are you excited?
Ms. Julia, where are you?
I'm very excited.
But she's not in 'Queen of the Express'.
- What?
Hey Kiddo“
Soon you'll be Mrs. Billimoria.
After marriage, no films.
Why not?
Devika was married.
Her husband never stopped her.
Himanshu was a 'Rai',
not a 'Billimoria'.
Zulfi?!
Zulfi! Zulfi!
Hurry up, come!
Where were you, buddy?
Zulfi!
Where were you, buddy?
All the world's a stage
and the stage is mine.
Ours! Ours!
I have a surprise for all of you.
Hitler!
Russia“
No, it's vodka and.. no!
Not there.
Oh no, they'll commit 'harakiri'.
No! Never!
OK, close your eyes.
Two steps forward.
And then a left!
OK, release.
- Release!
Julie, what are you doing?
- Open it.
Yes, Sergeant.
What is it?
Zulfi, what time is my entry on stage?
I just told you. Five minutes.
Double check please.
Entry huh!
I wanted to tell
you something important.
Tell me.
I'm embarrassed about
what happened in the jungle.
OK.
And also a little mad at you.
At me?
- Yes.
I was vulnerable for a minute
and you pounced on the opportunity.
Alright, I made a mistake.
Forgive me.
Listen.
Yes?
I had something else to say too.
Tell me.
I want to apologize.
For what?
This.
You mean, this.
On the contrary,
I should thank you for this.
Why?
I took advantage of you.
You could have taken
revenge during the knife act.
How bad is the wound? Show me.
Are you embarrassed?
You weren't shy when you undressed me.
Why're you doing this to me?
Doing what?
What happened was wrong.
A 100% wrong.
We must stay away from each other.
Far away.
Where is Miss Julia?
Everybody's waiting.
She's getting ready.
Right.
You can't go in.
Stop me.
- I said, you can't go in.
What the“
- Oh, hello Major!
I'm ready, let's go.
Zulfi, get the bags.
- Yes.
Bloody swine!
Miss Julia, this way.
- Sure.
Zulfi!
My cursed fate!
I'm going to get slaughtered
over your love affair.
Both of you will get yourself killed
and drag me along too.
Listen, stay away from her.
If her man finds out,
he'll bury you both alive.
Zulfi, my pistol“
- To hell with it!
Especially for you!
The celestial fairy has arrived.
The daredevil Miss Julia!
My beloved went to England
My beloved went to
England Playing the band,

- Here's to you, David.
White Monkey!
Go home, Whitey!
"You chinless wonders, our diamonds
are bigger than your dicks."
Go home, Whitey!
When my beloved flew in the
flying machine for the first time
Catching hold of the moon
He jumped off
That wasn't me, I was
in the bathroom when“
Do you smoke opium?
- No.
If he falls in Paris
The Eiffel Tower, will break his fall
By god's grace he will be saved
Blimey! He has lost all his hair
Yet he cuts a grand figure
Lest he is startled awake, Churchill
Lest he is startled awake, Churchill
Lest he is startled awake, Churchill
Lest he is startled awake, Churchill
Rusi sir?
Where in the fields I still He
I still wait in the
fields where we used to meet
I simply wish he does not forget

Conductor, don't miss my bus stand
Conductor, don't miss my bus stand

Driver, don't miss my bus stand
My beloved went to England

Stop!
Put the gun down.
Julia, I'm innocent.
I'm innocent, Julia.
- Drop it.
He'll kill me.
He won't, drop the pistol.
Drop it now.
Drop it.
Here you go.
White monkey!
Julia..
I've had enough here..
Zulfi?
Zulfi...?
- Zulfi...?
This is a Webley Scott revolver.
How did he get
a British Army pistol?
Sergeant Chandan Pandey!
Sergeant Hukum Singh!
- Yes, Captain!
Captain Karamveer Singh!
- Yes, Captain!
Sergeant Bahadur Chattri!
- Oh Nawab!
My friend Zulfi is no more.
- Sergeant Nawab Malik!
Nawab, what are you doing here?
The Captain is calling for you. C'mon.
C'mon now!
Sergeant Bahadur.
Sergeant Hukum Singh.
- Sir!
Sergeant Ram.
Sergeant Nawab Malik.
Ah yes, our local hero.
Sergeant Gurung.
Sergeant Sarabjit Singh.
Mr. Billimoria,
where should we dispatch the body to?
Where it belongs!
In the jungle, with the animals.
Mr. Rusi, for god's sake“
We'll bury him.
If you wish to be
buried alongside him,
you can go ahead
and dig his grave. Please.
Dump the body in the jungle.
He was an INA spy.
Which of you knew that?
Are there others like him..
Amongst you?
Or amongst us?
Yes.
Of course, there's one amongst us.
Mr. Billimoria..
But you can't even control a dozen
of your own people, for shame.
I understand“
- No, you do not understand!
I can have you arrested for this.
C'mon, David please“
Excuse me,
that's Major General Harding to you.
And what are you smiling at, you moron?
If you had any sense,
you wouldn't have shot him
and we could've caught the mole.
11 pm tomorrow, at Singhat.
He faithfully worked
for you for 15 years.
You denied him his last rites.
I can't tell
if you're naive or stupid.
At least I'm not heartless.
Hey Kiddo...
Come here.
Come“ come“
Your tongue has become
as sharp as your knives.
Nothing of mine is mine, Rusi.
Neither my tongue.
Nor my heart.
Not even my mind.
You set me free and I fly.
You call me
and I'm back in your lap.
When you want I'm Julia,
when you wish, Mrs. Billimoria.
Such big words
from my little Julia.
Who's been teaching you all this?
Remember". .
It's a Rusi Billimoria creation.
He was my shadow.
Yet I was unaware that
he was working for the INA.
What would you have
done if he'd told you?
I'd have saved him.
Explained to him that the INA
is with monsters
like the Japanese, Hitler, Mussolini“.
It's easy to see those monsters.
But what about the
monster that lives here?
The British.
Nobody sees them.
Not me,
but Zulfi.
This is what he'd have said.
What can be more
important than ones life?
There is.
That..
For which one can die!
Bloody hell.
This is love, this is love“
This is love, this is love“
The flame from the Sufis lamp
The embers keep burning even when doused
This is love, this is love“
This is love, this is love“
The river sleeps,
resting its head on the banks
Has been flowing for ages,
rising from the eyes
This is love, this is love“
This is love, this is love“
This is love, this is love“
Seeking solitude,
weaving shadows
Keeping its ears open
for the silk of the eyes
This is love, this is love“
You'll get me killed.
Don't worry, nothing will happen.
How come?
- Because I'm god.
I can do anything.
Like?
I can stop time,
wrap the sky around myself.
I can swallow the earth.
I can betray death, in your love..
...I can do anything, O beloved!
O the essence of my life!
Which movie is that from?
- No, I'm really god.
The flame rises from the Sufis lamp,
Allah hu...
Has to keep burning,
till neither I remain nor you
This is love, this is love“
This is love, this is love“
Lost in his own self,
this Sufi, an enigma
Tabrezi, when awake; Rum] when he speaks
This is love, this is love“
To the bomb shelter!
Hurry up! Keep moving!
We'll get to that, but first
position all the anti-aircraft guns.
Let's show the bloody hips who we are.
David.. Julia is missing.
That is not my concern.
Take him inside.
C'mon, lads!
Let's look lively.
Lend me a hand.
Keep going.
Major Williams.
Harding.
Uh-huh.
OK, good. Keep me posted.
Thank you Williams.
It's all over.
One plane is clown
and the others are
on their way back to 'Nipland'!
Three cheers for our boys.
Hip-hip! - Hurrah!
Hip-hip! - Hurrah!
Is there anyone here
who can
win over Julia?
Lover or warrior?
Come forward!
Rusi!
Miss Julia..
Your quarry is here.
Pull out your knives.
Friends!
Julia is brave,
then what is this secret?
Her lips quiver.
Her eyes widen in fear“
Is this a spell
cast upon her
or is it love?
The heart's greatest
enemy is the heart itself.
Fiery is a lover's temperament.
Tell me, Kiddo.
What?
- The truth
that is buried in your heart
and on the tip of my tongue.
Rusi, you left us all breathless today.
For a moment it felt that
you may indeed rip Julia's heart.
We're professionals, Mr. Patel.
It's our job to make lies look true.
Wow! Very well said!
But the vicious strikes
weren't false, Ms. Julia.
Any wounds?
Part of the game.
I'm fine.
Sometimes the wound is in one place,
the pain in another.
Ms. Haseena...?
Mr. Billimoria, we're still
searching for Sergeant Malik.
He will be here any moment.
Thank you, Major.
Only one of us can live..
Me“
or him.
Nawab!
Nawab, you need to
get out of here right now.
Rusi is going to kill you.
He's looking for you!
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Mama.
VICTORY TO INDIA
Indian National Army.
Mama!
Come back!
Come back!
Go on, Mama.
We have very little time.
Get going.
Nawab, you...?
Yes.
Captain Nawab Malik,
Gandhi Brigade,
Indian National Army.
We have a visitor, Major General.
At this hour? Who?
A very special guest.
I think you'd want to meet them.
Good.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Come with me.
You're a traitor.
Not just for me, but for your army too.
For your entire community!
I was a traitor
when I was a British soldier.
I realised that I've
been a slave for generations.
We need freedom from these monsters.
Whether we die for it
or kill for it.
My life's for the taking.
Take it.
Nawab, you're making a mistake.
Kill me or you'll get killed.
Are you even alive?
Had you been,
you'd have realised
the tyranny of your masters.
You'd have heard the
screams of the innocents!
I don't have to kill you.
You..
Are buried in your own body.
Not Bad.
You bloody traitor!
Williams, stop!
Mema, you too.
Bhyro Singh.
INA.
Yes.
First your make-up man,
HOW OUT nurse.
And there could be many more.
How did you find out?
- That oldie ratted out for money.
I tell you,
if the British ever leave India,
this is going to become one of
the most corrupt societies in the world.
What'll happen to him if you die?
Have mercy for your child
and tell me who else
is working with you.
How about now?
Not my child..
No! Please not my child.
Mommy..
Major General.
This isn't right.
- Fish-Posh.
I'm white, I'm always right.
Major“
Take the gun.
Take the gun, Mr. Billimoria.
I told you to take the gun!
Who is it? Who else?
No, Rusi.
- What are you waiting for?
Shoot damn it! Show us your loyalty!
No!
?Singing the INA anthem?
Glory to India!
I'm afraid, you won't be getting
your Victoria Cross after all.
Although I shall recommend
that you're nailed to one.
Take the traitor away.
Miss Julia, unfortunately I won't
be able to attend your last show.
I'm leaving for Calcutta
today with the two-edged sword.
Two-edged?
It'd appear that Sergeant Malik is the
sharper side of this two-edged sword.
I'm not leaving him behind.
If you'll excuse me.
You know that was the
INA anthem he was singing. - Sir?
It saddens me that
Tagore's beautiful tune
should be used
for such a doomed cause.
Mommy!
Wake up, mom.
Eat a little.
A little bit.
- Mommy!
Calm down, dear.
- Mommy.
Give me blood
and I shall give you freedom.
We all want freedom but we'd
rather let someone else bleed for it.
What can be more
important than one's life?
There is.
That for which one can die.
Very beautiful!

Guns.
Of course, Miss Julia.
Drop your guns.
You filthy“
Isn't there a women's
regiment in the INA?
The Queen of Jhansi Regiment?
Major Sir!
Over there!
Major General, thank god you're alive.
We thought..
You thought I was what? Dead?
Thankfully I'm a better actor
than these so-called performers!
Base to Mango-Gamma.
Sin.
One jeep is leaving
with reinforcements.
The road is inaccessible by trucks.
Sir, over and out.
How much farther?
Get to the bridge!
Fall out!
Where are the reinforcements?
I don't know, sir.
They should've been here before us.
Shit!
Over there.
I'm out Sir!
They're running out of ammunition.
Take the sword and cross the bridge.
And you?
I'll hold them off, leave now.
Not without you.
Son of a gun!
Once you cross over,
the INA post is about 2 miles away.
Inform them.
I can hold them off till they get here.
The hopes and dreams of millions
depend on this sword.
Go, Julia.
Go.
Stop!
Wait!
Nawab!
She's gone, sir.
Miss Julia, I request, please“
Come back here.
If for no one else, Ms. Julia.
Please come back for Rusi.
Kiddo, come back!
Oh my-my!
Look!
Your beloved is alive!
Julia!
No!
Go back.
- Hold back.
We need that sword.
They won't spare my life.
Trying to save me is pointless.
Miss Julia.
I promise
a fair trial for Sergeant Malik
and no case for you.
My word before my life.
If not by bullets,
then on the gallows.
My death is certain tomorrow.
But you're alive today.
Stop, Sergeant Malik!
What the hell is he trying to do, sir?
The rascal wants
to get himself killed.
Sergeant Malik,
one more step and you're dead.
Go Julia!
Farewell it is, surely not goodbye
The body is surely
not bereft of the sou!
Blow the bridge!
- No!
Kiddo, come back.
Kiddo!
Kiddo“ stop.
What do you want?
Can you really give me what I want?
Anything for you.
Will you take this
to where it belongs,
on the other side?
Come on, now.
I can't live without you.
But I've already died with him.
Bloody hell.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Billimoria.
Our sword.
