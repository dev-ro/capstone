Tell me where's the
slaughter-house?
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
Say it...
Tell me where's the
slaughter-house?
Confess it.
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
Say it on the video now!
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
"I was taking them
for slaughter".
Say it...
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
Say "I was taking
them for slaughter".
Say it...
Isn't he one of our guys?
No way.
Of course he is!
Damn! You're right!
These are our boys!
Too heavy?
No.
What else do we have to get?
We need some coriander.
Do you want to buy it from
this shop or that one?
Give me some lemons.
And coriander.
Are you preparing for exams?
Yeah. But...
education is not going
to take me anywhere.
I'd rather focus on my boxing.
Win a bronze at least.
And I can get a recommendation
from Bhagwan sir.
Then I can get a government job
with either railways or police.
And if that fails too...
I can always be a bodyguard to
a politician or a gangster.
You know that gangster Ansari?
He represented India at
the Commonwealth Games.
His gang-members are
state level wrestlers.
You've really done
your research!
If that's what you aim
for, then why be a boxer!
Be a sharp-shooter!
Stop laughing, shameless!
This is exactly why everyone
looks down upon our sports.
Mohan! Just saw your video.
- Which one?
In which you lynched
the cow-traders.
That wasn't me!
Oh really? Then it
must've been your ghost!
Go on... wash that meat!
Wasn't him, my ass!
It's because of
sportsmen like you...
that we barely get medals
in any sport, anymore.
Who plays for the sport anymore!
Who gives a damn for sportsmen!
At home, my father belittles me.
Because I chose boxing over my academics.
He's like an mp3 on loop!
Then the sports authorities that
screw us over with their politics!
I think...
that my anger with the world will
bring out the Mike Tyson in me.
As a coach, I understand
these boxers slacking off.
No one believes in
exercise and discipline.
Ask them to run a
few kilometers...
they'll get to a teashop
and while away the time.
Got everything, coach.
That's why I make them do chores...
carry sacks of wheat -
- Listen, keep it inside.
Okay, coach.
And that's how they
get their exercise...
or they start to get lazy.
Where should I keep this?
Sunaina, show him
the store room.
None of the ingredients of your meat curry
should pollute the sanctity of my home..
Cook your meat outside.
Should I put it here?
I've kept the sack inside.
I've put it in there!
Alright! The entire neighbourhood
doesn't need to know!
Not a single plate of
meat should come in here.
There's soap at the water pump,
eat outside and clean up outside.
Ok.
You guys are still doing this?
What can we do?
Are you guys washing
it with soap?!
That's hand-soap!
Woah! That's a lot!
Did 'Boss' butcher
an entire goat?
Must be around 10-12 kilos.
Bhagwan sir will have
2 kilos on his own.
Listen... does boss
have a daughter?
No. He has no children.
But the Bhiwani model has already
produced six olympian boxers.
The Bhiwani model is crap!
It's a complete copy
of the Cuba model.
You expect me to copy an
already copied model?
What did you do before
becoming a journalist?
I used to play Badminton.
Get the hell off of me!
I asked you to loosen my
muscles, not break my bones!
My elbow slipped.
If mine slips, it's
really going to hurt you!
Go, get the massage oil.
Years of training and this idiot
still doesn't know how to massage.
Wants to be a boxer!
Won't survive a round
against the pros!
Quit staring at me! Get the oil!
The pros don't stand
a chance against me!
Put me in the ring and see!
What?
You said - "Won't survive
against the pros" -
I'm saying they
won't survive me!
Try me!
Stop arguing. Get the oil.
Coach, pardon me for saying...
but we're training to be boxers.
Not masseurs!
You treat us like slaves.
You make us shop,
chop, peel and clean!
Those guys are washing meat.
I had to get flour.
Is this how you're going to
create a Mike Tyson, coach?
It wasn't my jab, that
started the brawl...
It wasn't my punch,
that brought my fall...
Sound of my chains,
is silence no more...
The fall of your pride,
that had no reason...
This fancy love, my
plight to treason...
To speak up the truth,
is defiance no more...
Cut and hooks Crips and blood.
Broken bones... knee
deep in shit...
It had to be...
what was to be...
It had to be...
what was to be...
It had to be...
what was to be...
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...
Brawl and Broil...
A Battle Royale...
Black n blue...
Kicks in Groin...
You're my friends!
What's happening?!
I really don't want
to hit you all...
Shravan, stop!
At least tell us why you're fighting!
- Mohan!
Please stop! - Go ask boss!
Power was his sparring game...
For I, to bob and weave...
For a Brawler...
For a Brawler...
it's all the same...
a pawn... a knight... a queen...
For every Rabbit
punch he threw...
I shadowed, slipped and swung...
Pulled a cross in every round...
A counterpunch that stung...
Broken teeth...
Blood and Spit...
Broken bones... Knee
deep in shit...
It had to be...
What was to be...
It had to be...
What was to be...

Brawl and Broil...

Kicks in Groin...
It wasn't my jab... that
started the brawl...
It wasn't my punch...
that brought my fall...
Sound of my chains...
is silence no more...
It's time to light the funeral pyre.
Your boxing dream is dead.
As long as I - Bhagwan
Das Mishra - live.
I won't let you box again.
You better go elsewhere!
Bloody moron!
Get my phone!
Our road to love is
rough, O' dear...
A game of hearts, can't
bluff, O' dear...
Listen, pass me a towel.
Stop staring, get me a towel.
Are you deaf?
I am asking for a towel!
Can't you hear?
You think I can't see what
you are trying to do?
Why did you hit her?
What did she do?!
I asked for a towel.
We heard! All of us did.
So your wife brought you one.
That's what she was
trying to tell you.
What are you staring at?
I'll rip your eyes out!
Go outside.
Go outside, Sunaina.
Go!
Doesn't respect elders!
I don't want that filth
in my house again..
If I lose my mind someday,
I'll chop her head off!
When you know you can't
speak for yourself...
it's best to bow your head
and keep your eyes low.
What?
Nothing.
Can I get a sheet?
Sunaina. That's
your name, right?
You must be wondering
who is writing to you?
I'm the same boxer whom you saw
getting beat up by your uncle.
I've haven't stopped
thinking about you since.
Each day is a battle.
I'll tell you my name when
me meet face-to-face.
If you don't know it already.
You are cemented in
my mind and heart.
Now your mind and heart
are free to decide.
All my love, Yours Truly.
Hey! Can I get another sheet?
Just one.
Where do I sign?
Your name isn't in the register.
Our road to love is
rough, O' dear...
A game of hearts, can't
bluff, O' dear...
You're a daughter to a plutocrat,
I'm a frustrated mistake.
You're fair and charming, pampered
brat I'm a juvenile keepsake...
I'm a juvenile keepsake...
She didn't even look at you.
I've come to look at her!
You're nested in a Queen's Mansion
I'm a homeless hobo hikin'
You're sleek as Porsche 911I'm
a drowning boat of a vikin'
I'm a drowning boat of a vikin'
If silent love that we partake...
softly grows within...
She's looking at me!
Oh god! I'm blushing.
He'll thrash me like an angry cop...
And put my hands in cuffs, O' dear.
Our road to love is rough, O' dear... A
game of hearts, can't bluff, O' dear...
Our family priest predicted
my future for me.
He says I'm bound to get
two things in life -
Progress and Success.
Progress will come
to me when I'm 28.
And success will
follow right after.
I just turned 28.
By the way, what's your name?
Pragati Dubey.
Tiwari.
Gopal Tiwari.
That's my number.
Save it as 'TYSON'.
You're bonus on a Xmas eve, I'm
a failing labour strike...
You're a michelin starred dessert...
I'm a stale bread no one likes...
I'm a stale bread
no one likes...
You're a showstopper for the fashion
weeks I'm a hideous drunken farce..
Your touch as soft as velvet skin...
I'm as rough as badger's arse.
I'm as rough as badger's arse.
My heart's swollen, ripe with love...
don't prick it with a spear.
Our road to love is rough, O' dear... A
game of hearts, can't bluff, O' dear...
Listen!
I've informed your father,
that your boxer is coming
to see him at the temple...
to speak about marriage.
But let me tell you...
nothing is going to come out it.
There is going to be a riot
if this marriage happens...
and your uncle is
gonna cause it.
My uncle is NOT my father...
Shravan?
Sir...
My younger brother is not
a very agreeable man..
And he doesn't like you.
Why do you want to
destroy it all?
I am not trying to
destroy anything...
He is the one with an ego..
But you won't
apologize either...
Am I the one who
wants to marry...
or my uncle...?
Of course, it's your wedding...
But your uncle's honour
won't allow it...
he'll get us all killed...
you.. your father... your hero ..
And me... he'll kill us all...
I'll slit his
throat before that.
Just because his name 'Bhagwan' means
'God'... it doesn't make him 'God'
God belongs here...
in the temple...
and everyone is aware
of his crimes...
you included.
You probably know more..
You're family...
What will you two survive
on post-marriage?
My mother is a great cook.
So you'll live off your
father all your life...?
When you married dad...
he was unemployed too.
But he had a lot of property...
But we had fields
in our village?
Yeah... they were grandfather's
but at least we had it...
His family doesn't
sleep hungry either...
How old are you?
Twenty-nine...
Ever had a job...?
If I win the tournament
next month...
I'll have a confirmed
job with the Railways..
And if you don't...?
Will you respect an
unemployed husband...?
When you were a kid... yes..
I would do the house work..
yes.. so...
cooked... cleaned... yeah..
- And dad slept all day...
- You still respected
him right...?
He does.
At least this one
fights for us...
Of course he'll fight...
he's a boxer...
Hey... easy...!
What now...?
Who looks at you? Singh?
That superstar... Ranveer Singh?
The way he looks at her...
Looks at whom?
Deepika Padukone? The actress?
Got it... your boxer looks at you...
like that hero looks at his heroine..
Right?
Look son...
Ranveer Sir lives in Mumbai...
as does Deepika Ma'am.
But we live here
in a small town...
Now... I don't know how
liberal her father was...
but I'm sure... I've been as
liberal within my capacity...
Don't cite films stars
as an example...
Actresses in India can get away
with more than the average woman
they can marry... or not...
but in this town that's
not how it works...
I won't let my daughter be
dishonoured by marrying down...
So get a job and
then we'll talk.
Only few days to the District tournament.
- Yeah I know.
This time you have to qualify.
Are you exercising your eye?
My eyesight is perfect.
- Can I ask you something?
- Ask me.
If your Juliet wasn't
your boss' niece...
would you still be
at war with him?
- What do you mean?!
Boxing is your one true passion... right?
- Yes..
And for that you would
go to any length?
So why don't you just
apologise to your boss?
- Don't you know love is blind!
Blind, yes. But not stupid!
Listen, Gopal.
She fell for me because...
I stood up to her
uncle's tyranny.
It's too late now
to undo the damage.
Now shut up, and
hold my feet up.
What did you do?
I know a guy who can
stitch it back to new.
Don't worry.
Figured out a plan
for your new shoes.
Tell me...
You know the big sweet
shop in the market?
- Yes. I made a bet
with it's owner...
What's the bet?
You have to break five
bricks in one chop.
- What?
- Loser pays 2500 rupees.
Have you lost your mind?!
I can't break more
than three bricks!
If you can't, then who can.
It's time to build
your strength.
Let's go.
How many bricks could
Bruce Lee break?
Bruce Lee?
Yeah.
In China, they don't use bricks.
Bruce Lee was from Hollywood...
not China!
Come on tiger! Now
let's do five!
One at a time.. I
can't risk my hand.
- Put four.
- Alright.
There you go!
Now put five!
Go for it!
Hail the Monkey-God!
I'm ugly as a snoring troll,
You're lovely aphrodite...
I'm the darkest demon of the hell
You're heaven's grace almighty.
You're a tranquil stream of love...
I'm a chaotic disquiet.
You're pious peace, a flying dove...
I'm a violent ethnic riot..
You're Taj Mahal on a starry night,
I'm a barren, unmarked grave...
You're blessing of the lords of
love, I'm Satan's conclave...
You're a soft and sombre violin
I'm a loud and noisy drum...
You're flawless like a Klashnikov...
I'm a faulty, useless gun..
You're crowned and fierce lioness
I'm a pet, grizzly bear...
Now, listen!
You're charming as a playful
child I'm a poor man's despair
I'm a battered run-down piece of
land You're a millionaire's suite
I'm a poisonous home made beer,
You're a glass of whiskey, neat.
You're Beyonce ruling MTV
I'm dull radio news.
You're modest as a beauty-queen
I'm mankind's abuse.
You're the monarch...
I'm a muck.
You're the winner...
I'm out of luck.
I'm just a bystander,
don't ask me to compete
I'll fail and fall on my face
tasting my own defeat, O' dear.
Our road to love is rough, O' dear... A
game of hearts, can't bluff, O' dear...
You were amazing.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Sir, I can barely hear you!
No, not someone else's wedding!
I'm at my own!
Just give me two days.
I'll give you a demo before
I leave for my honeymoon!
I promise!
By the way, a new product
has just come in.
It's like fertiliser
for your hair!
"I won over your heart."
Amazing.
"I've a jovial heart."
"And in this ambiance
of fun and frolic..."
"I had a little to drink."
Some snacks?
"I had a little to drink."
They are nice.
"Tie those trinklets..."
"Tie those trinklets
around my feet."
"And watch my gait."
"And watch my gait."
I'm almost twenty-six now.
I don't want to waste my
life playing a housewife...
to the big shots who
come to the house...
asking to marry me. They'll tie
me like a cow in their backyard.
Get a job soon and marry me. Or
come join the bonfire party...
when they burn my
hope and dreams!
Someone give my love a chance...
then see the fercoity of my dance...
The nose-ring tingles with laughter...
The earring swings in a trance...
Every maiden's heart will freeze...
When they see me pull out my stance...
What is this idiot doing here?
He is the groom's friend.
A bride gives her lover a shy glance
Their union makes me want to romance.
Someone give me...
Someone give my love a chance...
Then see the fercoity of my dance...
Someone give my love a chance...
Then see the fercoity of my dance...
See my ferocity...
Someone give my love a chance...
Then see the fercoity of my dance...
See my ferocity...
Turn off the gas, please.
Our neighbour's son got
a job in the capital.
Wasn't he your classmate?
Hmm.
In this country, even Olympic
medalists can't afford a house!
You think can live
off your boxing?
Hmm.
What "hmm"? Please
answer my question.
My mouth is full.
So? Empty it.
Spit it out.
Spit where?
Spit into my mouth.
You've shat on my dreams,
pissed on my honour...
might as well spit in my mouth!
Listen up! I'm
putting up the list.
Everyone on the list needs to
report at 8am sharp, day after.
Latecomers will be disqualified.
Okay, sir.
All the matches are listed here.
Check my name.
Check it one by one.
Check mine.
Don't rush!
Come one.
I am in.
Bhatia sir!
My name isn't on the District
Tournament list again!
My weight is within
the category.
All the boxers that I've knocked out in
under two minutes have made it on the list!
I haven't! Why?
You have high blood pressure.
How the hell can my BP be high?!
What do you mean how?
Look at you raging!
Fine. I'll shower in icy
water till it goes down.
Last year I was told
my eyesight was weak.
I ate papayas, and did
headstands all year long!
I got a certificate
from my doctor too.
The year before that, I had a
minor cut and you disallowed me.
What if the minor cut had become
major while you were boxing?
No Sports Officer is going to
risk his job to let you play!
Do you have a connection?
At least find a reasonable
excuse to not allow me to box.
Go speak to a doctor.
What if I get a health
certificate from him?
He needs to be a Sports doctor!
The certificate has to be government
approved, Boxing Federation approved!
Then it needs to be attested by
an authorised civil servant!
I'll get it done.
And most importantly,
the boss...
Bhagwan Das should
be in a mood...
to want to read it.
Sit here.
Greetings, coach sir!
Bring the bottle. - Yes, sir.
You want to box?
Yes, coach.
Gulp it down...
It's nectar. Gulp it.
I'll let you box.
We were hoping to have
'Spotless' Detergent...
be our main sponsor.
We'd like to name our Boxing
Championship prize...
the 'Spotless Detergent' Cup.
Our eleven winners
are the ones who...
end up representing our state
in the National Championship.
Would you like to
partner with us?
She's my niece!
Where did you get this?
So... you want her?
Hurry up.
Gopal.
Sunaina has given
me an ultimatum.
What did she say?
She's meeting a
prospective groom, today.
The owner of 'Spotless
Detergent'.
If I don't play this year
then it'll all be over.
That Bhagwan Sir!
If he sets his mind
against someone...
he'll find a way to
annihilate them.
He isn't as harmless
as he looks!
He's the cruelest bastard
I've ever known.
You should see how disrespectfully
he treats his own brother.
Sunaina's dad? - Yes.
Welcome.
This is my elder brother, Gopaldas.
- Greetings.
He is so subservient and
voiceless around Bhagwan Sir...
even though he is twelve
years elder to him.
Sunaina's wedding is just a business
transaction for Bhagwan Sir
and she has to constantly find
new ways to turn them down.
Because she can't express
herself at home...
she slaps me around and
takes it all out on me.
You'll weep like a child
if you read her letters.
I've saved them carefully
over two years.
Remember when I
broke three bricks?
I was so furious after
reading her letter.
I wrote Bhagwan on one brick, Das
on second and Mishra on third.
Broke all in one angry chop!
They are here!
Let's go.
The boy has arrived.
I know why you're upset.
We don't have a choice.
All the boys reject you
for your handicap.
I'm not handicapped!
I just can't speak. That's all!
I didn't mean that.
I will never marry a man...
who pities me.
"Oh poor girl."
"Can't speak."
"It's okay"
"I will marry her."
And when we step out together...
the entire world will judge us.
"He can't walk."
"She can't talk."
"A match made in
Handicap Heaven!"
Woah! Check out that car!
Even I would marry him for that!
Happy, rich and gay.
Shut up!
Is it a funeral?
Always wears black!
No one here will marry
a disreputed girl.
Means?
Let's go give her
a bad reputation.
Bro... Wait!
Think it through. She'll beat
you again if she finds out!
Let's just do it.
Driver's in there!
Who cares!
Light's already half broken.
Let's break it fully.
What?
I said.. let's finish
it completely!
- Run!
- Run!
Start it up.
Start it up.
He's coming.
- Run!
- Run!
Don't worry! Your
scooter is insured.
Hello.
Can I speak to the Inspector?
This is Bhagwandas.
Bhagwan Das... who?
Bhagwan Das Boxer!
We haven't met yet... is the
only reason you're still alive.
I'll barge into your ass and
play the drums with it!
Hand him the phone.
He didn't break anything.
I broke the light.
Why?
Because I am crazy
about Sunaina.
The light was already
half-broken.
Doc..
There's an emergency case.
I want you to take care of it.
Why you...
I don't get you.
You're fighting the man
whose daughter you love.
She's not his daughter.
Bhagwan Sir can't have children.
His cigar doesn't have
any tobacco in it, see.
Your broke his guest's car.
Publicly humiliated him.
Love his niece.
And then you want to be a boxer.
So?
Do you truly love her...
or you're pretending so you
can dishonour Bhagwan?
Our love is so pure...
that it could heal the sick.
Should've been a doctor then!
Why get caught in this mess!
The two men you
beat up inside...
are politically connected goons.
Their political connection
isn't a free pass to me.
Doesn't mean you
become a John Rambo!
Be invisible.
Use the prison time
to focus on boxing.
That's your only way up in life.
Don't let them distract you.
With a musty morsel,
Fed our hunger with
a punch in the gut.
Our hard earned money.
You robbed our money
and loaned it back to us.
Tied a rock to our heads,
pushed headfirst into the river.
In our own narratives, We're
reduced to two-bit minors.
Come death, come defeat,
We'll fight to the hilt!
For all your pride,
to hell with you!
To hell with obedience!
Screaming to the skies,
to hell with you!
To hell with obedience!
Hello, Sir.
All good?
I wanted to talk to you.
Regarding?
I am a boxer.
Do you have an appointment?
Yes.
Then get to the point!
I want to play the
district tournament.
Then meet the district coach.
I've tried. But he
wouldn't pick me.
Even though I'm the best he has.
He has banned me from the club.
You must've broken a rule.
No, Sir.
I've only refused his
personal chores.
He isn't the only selector.
- That's not true!
He decides everything.
If I'm selected somehow...
he won't let me play.
No one dares to go against him.
He is a political
bully and a mafia.
He lynches people to
show off his patriotism.
Sir, boxing is all I know.
I'm getting old.
If I don't play now I'll
never get a government job.
All my grievances
are in this letter.
Where do you stay?
- Next to the Railway Crossing.
Do you have family in Banaras?
My aunt lives there.
Get the form signed by her.
And go for the
Banaras selections.
Bareilly isn't the only
district in our state.
Is it allowed?
Of course!
With a gun to our heads,
You shamed us to dance!
You shamed us to dance!
You shamed us to dance!
Smearing black ink on our faces,
You disgraced us in a parade!
You disgraced us in a parade!
You disgraced us in a parade!
We refuse your torment!
Our wrath will get you!
Return our dignity, to
hell with obedience!
Screaming to the skies,
to hell with you!
SK Sir? Why aren't you
watching the match?
You call that a match!
This tournament is
a bloody farce.
Not a single boxer in there!
Only playing for a
bloody government job!
Worse than mattress makers.
Only fit to beat cotton!
They call themselves boxers!
Tea, please?
Man! It's freakin' insane in there!
Never seen someone box like that!
He's like a gladiator
in the colosseum!
The spectators have their
jaws on the floor!
C'mon! Make me a special tea.
He's at it non stop! Bam!
Bam! Bam! Bam!
Came out of nowhere!
What energy! Next level.
Insane! I've never
seen him before.
All of a suddeny.
Nice. Let it brew.
Let it go. You're
making sherbet!
Your rabid paws
scraping our gashes.
Our dreams chomped
like sewer rats.
Your rabid paws
scraping our gashes.
Our dreams chomped
like sewer rats.
Those crocodile tears.
Wolf in sheep's clothing.
Your serpentine tongue,
Spewing sugary promises.
Hurt us all you can,
we'll rise and roar,
Our wrath will get you!
Your days are over,
To hell with obedience!
To hell with obedience!
Screaming to the skies,
to hell with you!
You've messed with
the wrong man.
Now... first...
forget Mike Tyson,
Muhammed Ali, Bruce Lee..
And no more brawls
and breaking bricks.
Keep your hands safe...
Second... you won't be playing
these amateurs at state level.
The competition
will be fierce...
and we don't have time to prep.
Go home... wrap up unfinished
business and come back to me.
What are you looking at? - Wondering
what's so mesmerising about this...
that he gave up his education..
Brawled and went to jail for!
Neither can you eat
or drink out of it...
nor can I use it to
hammer anything.
Useless shit!
Lift up the lid...
It's multipurpose... blocks
all kinds of diarrohea...
Verbal and Anal!
And wash it after every use...
to prevent hemorrhoids.
What is your problem!
At least I'm trying!
Not loafing around like
the neighbourhood boys.
College could have...
- I couldn't! Don't you get it?
I couldn't focus! I'm brainless!
Shoot me!
It's genetics...
it's your DNA in me..
Were YOU a genius?
I'm asking you!
Were you a genius?
Was mom a genius?
When the two of you
echo stupidity...
how do you expect me
to be Aryabhatt.?
Just ignore him...
How do I ignore...
the shit he spews!
Forgive him!
You know it very well I don't
have brains for academics...
It's all greek to me.
This is all I know...
Either I become a boxer or be a brawler...
choose one!
Tendulkar was 15 when he started
to play cricket for India..
If he had you for a father...
then who'd be selling
half the products on TV?
There is something
called destiny!
What greatness
have you achieved?
What glory have you
bestowed upon this world!
At least I won a cup which can't
be used to hammer things...
- Ok... Stop it now!
- Yes I will...
Go fix your hand...
That's exactly what I was doing
before he started on me...
This is my passion! Do
you understand passion?
You don't... You need
brains for that!
You please shut up!
Lectures me about fashion...
Interested in fashion? Earn
your own money for it!
FASHION! It's his Fashion...
Don't let dad get to you.
He's generally frustrated...
You ignore him...
I'll cheer him up!
I'll get such good grades that
he'll be comparatively happy...
You just box...
You should've been my father.
- May I say something...
- Yeah.
You know why dad's upset?
Someone saw you on a date with a
girl somewhere and told him...
You didn't mention
it at home either.
He would've lost his mind...
if I'd told him that she is
mute and is from another caste.
She is mute?!
Yes... since birth...
You know our voice-box?
Larynx?
Yes that.. it's empty.
She can hear...
just can't speak.
But she is so beautiful...
you'll see!
So when do I meet her?
- I barely meet her myself...
She insists on getting
married first...
You need to learn to
show your affection!
She sees it all! Her
eyes are cinemascope.
That may be... but have you
ever gifted her anything?
- Like?
- Flowers or something?
Are you crazy? I'm
always broke...
You're a bum! Come with me.
Damn! You look stunning!
Let's take a selfie?
Do this.
You're supposed to...
What?
Time?
They're on a pilgrimage...
Wait... I'll check.
His grandma dreamt of the goddess.
So they... listen!
They had a morning train...
couldn't have missed it.
Did you miss your train?
Bro... you're inside?
Yes... with Sunaina!
Grandma got nauseous so
we had to turn around...
Should we get out
through the back?
You need to open the front door for us..
Let her leave!
Okay... wait!
Sunaina... Oh damn!
Coach Sanjay Kumar? - Yes.
This way...
Greetings.
Have a seat.
We've seen your list...
Yes.
You've selected a Shravan
Singh I believe.
Your name is Sanjay Kumar?
Yes.
Your last name?
I don't have one...
What caste are you? Priests?
Warriors? or Traders?
The fourth... which you didn't mention...
'The Untouchables'.
Waiter...
Get water in a
separate jug for him.
Shravan is a great boxer.
He's from your town.
He has great respect for you.
I know how much he respects me.
And I also know how
much you respect me...
I may have retired...
but my glutes are still
as strong as steel...
you can't break them...
you can however... lick them.
Use your words to kiss my ass...
and if you can't do that...
then shut up entirely.
Shravan Singh is the best
boxer in our team and town...
None of my boys can beat him.
Despite that... he'll never play
even at the district level...
that was my promise to him.
You are breaking that promise.
I know he knocked you
out in your own house.
Didn't he?
He told me... you
made him run errands.
- Which guru doesn't demand this?
- I don't.
They are sportsmen...
not servants...
and didn't he just
declare him the best?
Why did he ruin two prime
years of his 'best'?
For discipline. -You
call this discipline?
Cooking... doing the laundry...
cleaning the toilet..
Pump him up with all the
testosterone you've got...
Let's take it up in the ring.
But remember...
When a boxer is knocked out...
it's the coach who bleeds.
Goodbye!
This one...
I should go now.
I promise... we'll get
married this year.
It's time... you carry on.
Do you know why I
love you so much?
You were the first person
who was honest with me...
I really wanted to study further...
but no one allowed me.
I can't speak... so I've
been ignored all my life.
The only hope I'm holding
onto is your promise...
that you'd even give up boxing if needed...
to fulfill my dreams.
I've been waiting a long time...
this is the only year we've got.
I can't fight anymore...
I want to study further...
see the world with you...
come what may!
I'll visit you in Banaras.
Listen...
the neighbours had sent
too much of lamb biryani.
Pack it up for my boxers.
The Federation's meals aren't
even enough for a chess player.
What's with...
My mistress scratched it.
Out to conquer the world with your
certificate of your excellence...
You'll fall face first.
First learn how to kiss ass...
For what's more important
is whose back you scratch
and whose ass you wipe.
Sir... Shravan Kumar
Singh from Bareilly..
Whose woman you serve...
If a millionaire damsel would
bounce her tits for you.
I've offered it to the Ganges...
will grow it back
if one of you wins.
Learn to play...
Play to learn...
Boxing is stamina over strength.
Three rounds of three
minutes each...
Speed and stamina are essential.
You'll all swim across the river...
Let's go.
Learn to play...
Play to learn...
Learn to play... Life's Gambit..
Play to learn... Life's Gambit.
Break the rules... bend the grit.
Keep them fooled.. don't commit.
Learn to play... Life's Gambit..
Play to learn... Life's Gambit.
Break the rules... bend the grit.
Keep them fooled.. don't commit.
Whose boots will you lick?
Whose fetch will you stick?
Whom shall you wank? Or will
you pound him like a tank?
This way or that...
Plausible or rad...
Cash in on the chance unclad.
Keep rollin' on...
Don't be a minority...
Do what you want toto
hell with the authority.
You'll be the buzz of town...
Be a hero or a clown.
Why are you grinning?
Didn't you see?
You lost!
Lost? My punch was so strong!
The pain won't let him sleep!
You still have the
brain of a mule.
He landed more
punches than you...
which means he
scored more points.
So?
I have warrior's blood.
I can take a punch just as
strongly as I can land one.
I'll show you... Watch!
Everyone has a guarantee.
Even I had a chance.
But I missed it...
all thanks to
moralality bulls♪♪♪
When the punch comes
from the right...
dodge it, move left
and let it slip.
Then... a left hook...
bob and weave...
Left to right...
right to left...
like your mother used to knit.
We made it with old
tyres and tubes...
because the funds released by the
boxing federation were either used...
by the officials to
buy a holiday-home...
or a sparkle for
his wife's finger.
Your false 'Warrior' pride
will never let you learn.
What's my mistake?
A jab coming from the
elbow has no strength.
A superhero throwing random
punches looks good in cinema...
Let the power come from the ground ..
Up your feet.
Through your stomach
into your shoulder...
and then throw the punch.
The monkey, the snake
and the cat...
Watch them keenly!
Dodge like a monkey...
attack like a snake..
"Do bad, and you'll
have it all."
"Do good, and you lose all."
"Turn your life into hell,
then dream about heaven."
In the end, all is one Burn
the books, hold the gun...
Cock the hammer, have some fun
Point blank - kill someone...
Throw the life for a toss
One who wins is the boss...
Nail the law - on the Cross.
Sell the country at a loss.
Who to read or to follow...
Who'll lead us to the gallow...
Next one in line
Satan with halo..
Everything is planned now...
Whom to lynch, whom to rape and
which one's to be banned now.
Don't call thyself a man now.
We bring the fight again now.
Learn to play, Life's gambit
Play to Learn, life's gambit.
Crank the tool, throw a fit...
School's over... do that shit.
Looking for space for Vatika.
Can you show me.
He's looking for the cafe
we're coming from...
I can't understand
either one of you..
Sorry brother... no English!
I know sign language.
Yes. I know.
So you can hear?
Can you take me to the
place called Vatika.
Who are you looking for?
Waiting for someone?
No..
Did you not just waste
two hours with her?
She said... she'll be back soon.
Go to her...
Get the hell out of here!
Come an hour early tomorrow...
I'll show you how to romance.
The horny youth of this country
is the reason of it's sad state..
Sunaina...
You told me you'll
be back soon...
I was waiting for
you at the gym...
and you're here
flirting with him.
What's wrong with you?
I know he is a
fair-skinned foreigner...
didn't take you long
to start drooling.
Excuse me.
Get lost.
Sorry.
Go to hell!
You're like my uncle!
Don't talk to me.
All men are jerks!
They put women on a leash and...
treat them like slaves.
Don't ever call me again.
Hello Sir..
The foreigner that I hit?
Where does he live?
Mr. English...
I am sorry bro...
Come on.
Isn't our tournament here?
Minister is having a
family wedding, instead...
Now?
69.150.
Loose the undies...
Drop your undies down!
Should've waited!
For me to pull them off
and wave it like a flag.
69.
Weight approved.
This ain't right!
Thus commences the State
Boxing Championship...
sponsored by
'Spotless' Detergent.
In this exciting
game of boxing...
we've three rounds of
three minutes each...
After each round...
That's nice.
Trying to get to the waist.
Stop the match...
Minister Sir is here.
Our dear Minister Sir is here...
all rise!
Our great state...
land of Hockey Legends...
of Cricketing Legends...
home to great Wrestlers
and Shooters...
home to great Mohammed Ali.
My apologies...
Mohammed Ali was
from South India.
Since Minister Sir was late... we
are now re-starting the match...
And once again we commence
State Boxing Championship...
presented by
'Spotless' Detergent.
Anyone can tell that he is
over-weight in the category.
It doesn't matter who's what...
you'll still be 'untouchable'.
The federation has
empowered me...
to do... whatever I want.
Your boy will have to fight
many over-weights to win.
Bhagwan Sir is playing
a dirty game...
He's put all the seasoned
boxers against Shravan...
The matches were to
be held indoors...
but the sports' minister occupied
it for the family wedding.
I re-organised it with my own money...
haven't misused your funds.
A Boxing Film in India
has more spectators...
than an actual
Boxing Tournament.
What amazing footwork
by the one in blue...
It's a complete
display of strength.
Using his full strength.
And slowly overpowering
his opponent.
But...
It seems like entire city
is with Shravan Kumar.
Both the boxers trying hard...
Stop!
Why are you chasing a knockout?
Score those points!
I can easily get a Knock Out.
You can't beat him
with your strength...
Tire him out... Okay?
Keep a cool head.
Shravan Kumar Singh.
And our very own son of Bareily,
Keeps making comebacks.
But Shravan Kumar Singh
is a atheletic Sportsman.
Making him run around and
scoring points our winner...
Shravan Kumar Singh.
This steroid
empowers the bull...
to romp with a hundred cows.
All I want is to see
Shravan knocked out...
so hard that he
gives up on Boxing.
Then watch me make you
the next Indian Champ.
I didn't need to see the
evidence to know...
how we play sports.
To wake you...
to warn you...
Bhagwan Sir is
over-dosing Balbir...
Wow...
Bhagwan Das has turned
him into a monster.
He'll maul Shravan in the game.
Where is my Vaseline?!
Someone stole my Vaseline.
Bro... They're even
stealing the undies.
Every steroid has a dose-limit.
And it seems like they're
pumping him with far too much.
His lungs will be under stress.
He'll be breathless...
take advantage of that..
First round... Let him feel
you're easy to beat...
let him use up his stamina
and when he's spent...
go for the kill!
Shravan, you can
basically see that...
he's tiring out Balbir.
He's efforts are
to make him tired.
So that he uses up
all his energy.
That's a boxing
stratergy, and...
both the boxers are showing
lot of enthusiasm.
And also very experienced.
He's on forward defense,
covering himself.
Balbir is on attacking.
But once again Shravan using
The same stratergy...
trying to tire him out.
Evading Shravan's punches.
Water!
It'll make you bloat...
keep that bottle away.
Shravan.
Once again.
Stop.
One.
Two.
Get up.
Four.
Get up.
What are you looking at? Get up!
Six.
Get up!
Seven.
And once again Shravan Kumar...
makes a come back.
And once again
Balbir's knocked out.
Balbir from Ghaziabad...
has been knocked out
by the son of Beneras.
Let's see if he can get up.
Or not.
Six.
The counting has begun.
Eight. Nine. Ten.
Mr. Shravan...
Mind if I put your photo
in the local paper?
I need to write a
five line report...
as per Bhagwan Sir.
A photo in the paper would
convince my Father-in-law...
he might think this is fake.
Take my picture.
Sure... give it.
Take it...
Don't you have a camera?
I've a passport size photo.
- Have one?
- Here!
What are you doing?
Your cherry is yet to ripen...
Your lips of love...
Your lips of love
are yet untouched.
At three, we shall...
At three, we shall...
In the quiet of day-break
We shall pound the duck.
At three, we shall...
Come on.
Go on then.
I am, how much more?
Come on.
The long handle is stuck...
and the bastard doesn't pluck.
At three, we shall...
In the quiet of day-break
We shall pound the duck.
At three, we shall...
Did he get me
pregnant or did you?
Why should I ask him?
As it is... we're his puppets.
We eat what he says, when he says...
sleep when he says..
Can we decide, for once?
Who else will you fight for?
She's our only child...
and this is your only chance
to prove your worth to her.
At three, we shall...
Oi sweetheart, your
band's playing.
Golden bride is delaying.
Oi sweetheart, your
band's playing.
Golden bride is delaying.
Aunty, how about a token.
Every sprain, ask for a rub...
Keep your Boxer flexed,
make sure he drubs.
If he doesn't, pound you hard
then let him go for a pilgrimage.
It was her decision...
What can I do?
She's your daughter...
isn't she?
How can a woman decide!
When have women had any
say in our family!
In 'your' family!
- If she marries that boy...
You'll kill us all?
Why don't you get
it into your head?
I am Bhagwan Das Mishra!
We're Brahmins...
the highest caste.
And a Brahmin girl is
marrying a Rajput.
A Rajput whose
purity is doubtful.
Many lower castes change their last
name to pass off as higher caste.
That 'Spotless' Detergent guy...
wasn't he a lower caste?
Are you aware of
how wealthy he is?
If his wealth makes him
worthy of a Brahmin...
then my lack of wealth...
makes this marriage perfect.
No one will attend this wedding.
Go back inside!
No one has ever dared
to dishonour me...
but today... you've done that.
I shall never forget this.
You are dead to me.
"The water will come at 3:30."
"3:30."
"3:30."
"3:30."
"The water will come at 3:30."
Where's the father of the bride?
What's in your mouth?
Look! Bride's father is here.
Please come, sir!
Please sit!
Hey! Make space.
Please continue.
- Tea!
- Thank you.
Tea?
Wake him! It's his
first day at work.
Let him sleep.
I'll get tea for you.
I need wifi at home.
We just use the
neighbor's wifi...
Internet is Bajrangi Bhaijaan.
- And the password is...
- Dabangg Sultan.
How does a husband
say bye to his wife?
Let's go!
Move your bag!
Cover your chest
when you step out.
What's your work?
Exactly what we're doing.
But this is manual labour!
What's your work?
I was told...
to get this moved.
Then why're you
moving it yourself?
Oh!
Didn't realise!
This is the Yard where...
the damaged trains are
brought for repair.
The broken parts are
carelessly thrown around.
I want you to sort this mess.
Yes.
Get it cleaned, repainted
and organised.
Sir, every day I -
- have practice?
Yes.
Why waste your time...
practicing to lose
internationally?
Better to waste
your time here...
it pays.
Hit harder.
Harder!
Greetings!
Yeah.
Already arriving late
like a celebrity?
Too much workload.
I never knew my city
had such a great gym.
Shravan...
know him?
Of course Coach...
Every local boxer who
died dreaming...
he's the reason cited
in the post mortem.
He's the reason I turned to you.
You're still as arrogant!
I'm just being honest.
You need to grow up...
What you set out to do...
isn't always what
you end up doing...
the system finds a
way to crush you.
He's still managed
to run this gym...
free of charge...
without the
authorities' knowledge.
He reminds me of our youth.
When we'd get into brawls...
pledging to change the world!
Couldn't change shit!
- Do you know my caste?
- No.
Even I didn't know...
until my father told me.
And that's how he
clipped my wings.
He wanted me to study
just enough...
to get a caste-reserved
spot in government jobs.
But I wanted it all on merit.
Then I came across
Pele's story...
of how football gave
him an identity.
I decided to play football too.
But the upper caste boys
wouldn't let me play.
One day I fought with them.
It was a vicious fight.
The coach locked me in a room...
and whacked me.
He was from my caste.
He gave me a sack of wheat...
and made me punch it
every time I got angry.
And that's how I learnt to box.
But I could never play...
Every time I walked down the street ..
They'd call me 'The Brawler'.
They never gave me the
respect of a 'Boxer'.
Now, you decide... Do you want
to be called 'The Brawler'...
or 'The Boxer'?
Stop that!
Yes.. I want to sleep...
I'm exhausted.
I've been waiting
all day for you.
And I've been working all day...
had to move heavy
equipment around.
My training didn't go well, either...
Just ran around in circles.
Even talking to you
is taking effort.
You'd promised to
learn my language.
Your language... But
you can't spea -
Oh! You mean the sign language.
See... your phone
speaks for you...
and you can hear me
and we communicate!
Do I really need to learn -
Why are you always hitting me?
Listen! We don't
need to do this.
Okay.. I made a mistake.
Sorry... Let's sleep.
Come to bed...
Let's not do this!
How'll you hear me if
you cover your ears?
Come to bed.
Why're you being so stubborn?
How much more do you
want me to apologise!?
What's going on?
Nothing... You go sleep.
Do whatever you want!
'I'm not a damn pillow'
When did I ever treat
you like that?
And is this the time to study?
'I don't work on your time'.
Why're you so difficult?
It was my first
day at work and -
- how do I even talk to you?!
Fine...
You be the first two monkeys of Gandhi...
I'll become the third.
You don't listen... can't speak...
and I refuse to look at you... Ok?
Great communication we have!
Brother, please give me a
month to pay you back.
I finally have a job.
And will be in a
permanent position soon.
Let my salary come in.
I'll pay you first.
It's only been two weeks.
Don't worry!
As soon as you have a job, the
moneylenders become hound dogs.
- Mr. Shravan..
- Yes.
You can't take personal
calls in office.
What else do I do!
There's no other work here.
Shravan.
Yadav Sir's peon is on leave.
He's called you in.
So am I a peon now?
Excuse me!
Sir... you called -
- Learn some manners...
step out and ask,
"May I come in?"
May I come in?
You may come in.
May I sit?
You may not.
Get the chief engineer
to sign this...
and post these letters.
Sign where?
Hey...
Where's the chief
engineer's cabin?
Which Chief Engineer exactly?
He didn't give me a name... just
asked me to get this signed.
But this isn't your job!
This one's in east block.
His name is Srinivasan.
Where's Mr. Srinivasan's cabin?
May I ome in.
Mr. Srinivasan isn't there!
Sir's in a meeting
in that block.
Then why'd you send
me to his cabin!
You asked for it!
Do I look like a peon?
Peon?
Aren't we all peons to someone?
What?
Sir, I need your signature.
Can't you see I'm in a meeting?
Wait outside!
Where the hell are you?
Do you know what time it is!
We've been waiting for you!
I've a tiny job to finish
but they're holding me up.
I tried to talk to him but
he starts spouting English!
Tell him you're a sportsman.
May I...
What's your problem man?
I'm a sportsman... Boxer.
Don't you understand
we're in a meeting!
I'm here on 'Sports Quota'...
I need to go for training.
I'm late.
You get out man!
What?
He's got one foot here
and one foot there...
It'll tear him apart.
You're still on probation.
Your job will be confirmed
only if you win at Nationals.
So boxing is more important!
You need to make time for it...
every day.
Sorry!
She's been in her
room all day...
hasn't eaten either.
She neither helps me with
housework nor massages my feet!
On her computer all day.
Shut up!
That's not what I'm
saying at all!
But that's what I'm saying!
So... She'll do
what he couldn't!
Become an officer... not a peon!
I'm talking about last night!
I'm talking about every day!
What every day?!
I'm trying to resolve a fight and here
you've started a new complaint box!
Did you ever massage
my mother's feet?
Great!
Blame it all on me!
Sportsmen should marry only
after becoming champions...
especially wrestlers and boxers.
When your wives take your sperm...
they also make you weak.
Your sperm is where
your strength is!
Think about it...
Had you married later...
you'd have a beautiful wife...
bigger dowry...
and it'd have made news.
Dangling from a seedy wall.
Behind a Gandhi picture-frame.
She slithers on a hot afternoon.
Long, ugly, wicked!
That loathsome lizard!
Creepy-crawly lizard.
No dinner?
She's eaten already...
when does she wait for anyone!
Deadly-diddly vermin!
That two-faced wizard!
Oh so crafty!
Oh so evil!
That venomous lizard!
Crawling deviously
about the picture-frame.
Your husband slept
in class today.
Preying and prying.
Preying and prying.
And just when...
And just when...
A moth flutters by,
And moves past the lizard,
She grabs it tight.
Crushes its frail feathers.
Nibbles on its tender flesh.
Gobbles it up alive.
And then she sashays away.
As though nothing happened.
And then she sashays away.
As though no one was harmed.
Crawls back.
Crawls back.
Behind the picture frame.
Awaiting her next kill.
My father used to serve an
upper caste landlord...
now a higher caste serves me.
Yes.
Creepy-crawly lizard.
Deadly-diddly vermin.
That two-faced wizard!
Sir, it was very difficult
for me to get this job.
If I lose my game...
I'll lose my job too.
Wasn't easy to get
through sports quota.
Lot of blood and sweat
has gone into it.
Please respect my time.
Training is essential for me.
If you give me the day's schedule
first thing every morning...
it'll help me wind up
sooner and leave -
- Pillai.
Yes sir!
I know I've been selfish lately.
Your mother was talking
about grandkids today...
but I'm not ready
to be a mother.
And I realised that I
pushed us to get married...
without realising how much
more we have to achieve.
You have your own dream...
of winning the Nationals.
You also need to get
a permanent job.
I've been selfishly
adding to your stress.
Please ignore me and
focus on your boxing...
till then I'll express
myself through letters...
and we'll find a way to communicate
till you become a champion.
May I come in?
You may come in.
Do you drive?
Yes sir.
Do you know my car?
Yes.
Take my car keys...
and my 'ATM'.
Go to my house... Give
the 'ATM' to my wife.
She's in the mood
to go 'marketing'.
Take her to the market and
drop her back home after.
Get the car and the 'ATM' back.
Alright?
Take it.
Yadav sir...
I'm not here to
run your errands.
I will fill in for your peon
because it's still office work.
But I'm neither your driver...
nor your servant.
Nor friend or family.
May I leave now?
You've been put on night shift now.
Bye bye to...
May I come in?
You may not.
I can't do night shift.
Why? Afraid of the dark?
I have to train for Nationals!
So just do that... Quit the job!
You're deliberately making
it difficult for me.
Do you know how hard one has
to work to get your job?
I sat under a street lamp to
study while you played outside!
Why punish me because
you couldn't play!
What glory has any sport ever
brought to this country!
As if your education has
turned India into America.
You sit behind this desk...
asking for service all day...
and jerk off to the idea of a developed
country... Resentful coward.
- Hey.
- What?
What did you call me?
Don't forget who I am!
I'm the Mike Tyson of the state!
If I punch you...
you'll shit your pants!
Another punch... and your
soul will exit this body!
That sure will develop the railways...
and this country!
Should I bring the glory?
What the hell?
Peed your pants?
Don't move!
Take off your pants...
or should I make you?!
Quick!
Say hello to my boss...
who, in my esteemed company...
easily wets his pants!
See the wetness... down there!
If you ever mess
with me again...
this video will go viral.
May I leave?
Yes coach?
Remember the boxer who...
won Bronze at Nationals
last year...
wants to play a friendly match.
He's a southpaw... it'll
be a good for you..
Interested?
Of course.
We'll go back to the village.
We'll plough our fields.
That wil be better.
I'll do as Bhagwan says.
What's wrong?
Gopal Das!
Yes?
Car keys!
Sorry?
Your car keys.
Any personal stuff in the car?
A few...
Listen...
bag all his stuff and
take the car away.
Keys to your drawer?
But why?
A case has been filed...
against you for taking a bribe..
In the bridge repairing job.
I knew Bhagwan was behind this.
I tried calling him.
Waited for him at his club...
Neither did he take my calls...
nor met me.
When I got home...
there was a crowd outside.
Meera sat there...
with all our stuff
strewn along the road.
Why're you doing this?
You got me fired...
took my car...
now my house -
This is my fault, isn't it?
Are you leaving for
your grandmother's too?
I promise...
I'll fix everything.
I don't know how...
but I will.
Safe journey.
Bye.
Please step out.
Come on.
What happened?
We have to go to my family home.
Why?
Bhagwan wants to
resettle the property.
Move it.
Keep your hands off!
Stay away.
We're coming!
Come child!
Come on.
Get down.
Why are we here?
Come inside.
I know that wasn't the plan...
but we're here now.
I don't feel safe here.
What's wrong?
Leave me.
I don't think...
Gopal Das will ever walk again.
Your daughter can't
speak as it is...
Would you like to join
the handicap universe?
Either you do as I say...
or choose your body part...
for sacrifice.
Right. Right. Use right more.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Punch him.
That was a solid knock!
See you at Nationals...
It'll be fun.
Ice your hand.- Yes coach.
You were focussed today...
played very well.
I don't know about focus,
but I feel angry a lot.
You need to control that.
Come.
It's a lovely house.
It's Bhatia's friend's place.
Hey, we're home.
Rice will take time...
dinner will be a while.
You should've told me that
you're bringing someone.
My mistake...
won't happen again.
Listen...
make the lentil soup thick...
a boxer needs his protein.
Bhagwan Das will try
everything to disqualify you.
Can't let that happen.
Don't eat any outside food.
It could be adulterated.
Watch your weight...
keep it under seventy!
It is... in fact I
want to gain some.
Good that your wife isn't here...
Rest your body.
Give more time to practice.
There's another boxer...
from Punjab.
He's young. Watch
his youtube video.
Watch his moves.
He's very sharp.
And if I know
Bhagwan Das well...
this boxer will be
your first opponent.
Who's it?
Hold on!
Yes.
We had a feast at home... I
know you like goat meat.
The neighbours have
sent goat curry..
What luck!
Some meat for our dinner!
Did you hear me?
There's goat meat for dinner.
What's with the lights?
Can you please check?
Why did the lights go off?
I'll check.
Sanjay Kumar! Open the door!
Don't open the door!
Relax! You've two boxers here.
Wait! I'm coming.
Open up!
Hail Mother India!
Protect our Holy Cow!
Smash the bugger's head!
We are the 'Cow Army'!
The holy cow is sacred!
We are her protectors!
Hit him.
Hit him.
Kill him.
Kill him.
You've to stay alive, son...
and watch them all
go one by one.
Where's coach?
In the ICU!
Alive!
The neighbour dropped
off that meat...
and said it was goat meat.
It's not a crime even
if it had been beef.
We've made a few arrests...
And Bhagwan Sir?
He saved your life.
That's what you think!
That's what everyone thinks!
Your coach cooked beef at home.
Someone at the temple
informed the protectors...
and the mob lynched you.
Bhagwan Das arrived in
time to save all of you.
Everyone believes that...
and what everyone believes...
is the truth.
And that should be your
official statement.
Son...
A man's true enemy...
is his own circumstance.
There is no point
fighting a lost battle.
Saddam Hussain, Gaddafi..
Were great kings...
before they were dragged
to their deaths.
I don't care who...
or how they died!
I know that I want to
live on my terms...
till I die!
I don't care... If I die
like a king or a dog!
Rigidity is broken easily
than adaptability.
Give him what he wants.
Give it?
He is asking for my life.
Sunaina isn't some
medal I won...
she's my heart and soul.
Hello Sunaina... where are you?
Can you hear me?
Why have you sent me
these divorce papers?
Want to leave me?
Or is someone forcing
you to do this?
I am telling you... I'm
not letting you go.
And if it's your uncle... tell
him that I'll fight to the end.
You weren't supposed
to be with him...
I had better plans for you.
Where's Sunaina?
Nevertheless...
everything happens
for the reason...
I didn't let you die because I
want to see you lose at Nationals.
Who'll beat me?
You're going to
lose on your own.
And if I don't?
Then you'll suffer...
Secondly...
I've sent the divorce
papers with your parents...
You'll be divorcing my niece...
because she's mute and
she didn't pay dowry.
I won't sign the papers.
Then I'll make you suffer more.
I'm not negotiating...
I'm a Brahmin... so I command...
and you obey! Or else...
I want to speak to my wife...
and know if she feels the same.
Let me meet her -
Hello?
They're letting me go coach.
I promise you... that
I'll train hard...
and I won't let you down.
I'll win this fight
against Bhagwan Das...
even if he puts me in the
ring with Tyson himself.
Wait with your bike
at the market...
I'll call you when I'm done.
You're entering Ravana's den...
If I want to rescue
Sita I'll have to...
I don't have the
Monkey God to help me.
Get ready!
No one knows where Sunaina
has been locked up...
nor do we know her
parents' whereabouts.
Son...
I was thirteen...
when I was married
off to Bhagwan Das.
Just do as he says.
I know the animal
I've been married to.
Not again! Papa... There's
again a power cut.
What are you doing here?
The British have cut
all supplies...
they'll restart it only
if we hang the rebels.
What's this nonsense?
I am waiting...
for that guy to leave.
Our water and power supply has been cut...
Thanks to you!
I've been trying
to steal power...
for the last two days...
but he won't let me.
Lord Mountbatten has stationed
him for that job alone.
I'm waiting for him
to go take a dump...
so I can hook my wire
to the main line.
Slowly, the stake went
through my heart...
Every throb echoes
with torment..
Gopal, just take my gym bag...
For without you,
I am but undead.
A vessel inanimate...
I am incomplete Without
you, Within me.
I am incomplete Without
you, Within me.
This life's adrift
with your void...
For finding you again.. I will
Wade through every tempest.
Annihilate the
strongest mountains
I'll swim through
lakes of fire..
Your wounds permeate
through my pain.
The firestorm's
about to blaze...
and everything in it's way
shall be reduced to ashes.
I am incomplete Without
you, Within me.
How can I file a report
without evidence!
He-said-she-said...
doesn't work here.
It'll be chaos.
The law doesn't bend for anyone.
You know I'm telling the truth.
I know you know what
I've been through.
Am I Google...
that I know everything?
The first rule of law...
is that we know nothing.
Believe... only what you see!
I've given her number
to my uncle...
and told him it's an emergency.
But he can't track her...
unless she turns her phone on.
Boss' boys might know
where she's locked up.
I've tried but
they don't answer.
They must be the ones
keeping a watch on her.
Doubtless. 100 percent.
- What?
- 'Doubtless'
Don't start spouting
English with me!
- Eh, man!
- Can't you speak in Hindi?
Alright! 'Nissandeh'
they're with her.
So couldn't you say 'Nissandeh'.
Huh?
My English as it is...
is six feet under...
and then you use
complicated words!
Okay, sorry.
I think you have brain damage.
Of course... I've been hit on the head...
Not my knees!
Okay... Didn't get the joke!
Can you trace it?
Ask your uncle to try
his best to trace it.
What'd you say?
- Wait a minute...
- No.. What'd you say?
Asking him to use the number
to find the location.
- Put it under surveillance.
- Again!
Eh, please let me - - Enough
with 'doubtless' and 'trace'
Which language were
you schooled in?
Did you go to a Convent?
We went to a Hindi-speaking school!
Did we not?
Fine! I'm sorry!
So... Stop it then.
- Okay.. I did!
- Then talk to him properly!
Dude! Just listen!
Use her number... Sorry -
Use her 'sankhya' to find her.
If my uncle gets caught...
he'll lose his job!
And kick my ass!
Is that job more
important than her?
She sleeps with him...
not my uncle!
You broke the only cup you had.
Nothing else will break...
it's all metal.
Hey! Shravan!?
Listen to me...
Hey! Shravan!?
Where are you going?
I'll break your face!
Have you seen her around?
She can't speak.
Have you seen her somewhere?
She can't speak.
Have you completely lost it?
This isn't the way to find her.
Tell me what to do!
Tell me! Show me the way...
you All-knowing English
Spouting Baba.
Shit it out!
Let's try that.
Sir, that boy is not giving up.
If the newspapers get a whiff
of it we'd be in a big mess.
He's plastered his wife's
posters all over town...
Stop the car!
Stop it! Bhagwan Das?
Where is Sunaina?
Where the hell is she?
Tell me! Where is she?
Where is my wife!
Get off me!
Where is Sunaina?
Where is Sunaina?
Stay back.
I won't let him pass...
until he tells me!
Where is Sunaina?
What are you doing?
Bhagwan Das.
Where is Sunaina?
This is not right.
He has kidnapped my wife!
You're in this with him!
You were in his car!
How do you know that he
has kidnapped your wife?!
Tell me... Why
were you with him?
I am not with him?
Get your hands off me!
You think you can take
law into your own hands!
I'm not! I'm just
looking for my wife!
So you think you can
create a scene here!
Sir, you're sounding like him.
- Get me proof!
- What proof do you need!
The divorce papers were
signed by the girl!
He forced her to! The entire
city knows he kidnapped her!
That's proof enough!
- But I saw her signatures on the paper.
I told you she was forced to!
- How are you so sure?
She would never do it!
Bhagwan Das is an
elected representative.
If I wasn't in the
car with him...
he'd have run you over
or put you in prison.
Such theatrics won't
bring your wife back!
Bravo.
This sombre dusky break of dawn.
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.
While I stare into
unpronounceable abyss.
For eternity to fail in flight.
A million hope's
reflection shone
false miracles unfreed.
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...
Our severed love decreed.
This sombre dusky break of dawn.
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.
This sombre dusky break of dawn.
Divorce papers have been signed.
You've already met the girl.
She is as beautiful and...
upper caste as she was.
As for everything else...
the dowry will compensate.
Give me the ring.
Put it on yourself.
Now put it on her.
Hold her hand.
Alright, done!
- Come on hit me!
- What are you doing?
Hit me!
Have you lost your mind!
I'm practicing!
You'll get yourself
killed like this!
Look at you!
When was the last
time you slept?
I can't sleep... what do I do?
Shoot up drugs?
Why not shoot yourself!
You think your tantrums on the streets
will help you find your wife!
She's not a movie star... for
people to recognize her by a photo.
Neither are you a big shot!
Why would anyone bother!
It's important for you
to win the Nationals.
Rest your body.
How do I rest my body...
when my mind is not at rest!
You'll have to!
No one...
No one is interested
in your tragedy.
Your anger will be the
death of your career...
It will kill your game!
Make anger your weapon!
Not your state of mind.
Pack all that rage
you carry within...
into your fist.
Then step into that ring...
and unleash it...
hit so damn hard that
every one wonders...
and asks about you.
What's his name?!
And when they ask... that's
when you tell them...
'My name is Shravan
Kumar Singh!'
Make them listen.
And when you have
their attention...
then speak up...
how this boxing mafia Bhagwan Das
Mishra has snatched your wife.
You want her back, don't you?
So play for her...
and win for her.
Sunaina.
Please eat.
Wake up!
Please eat, love.
This food isn't drugged.
Come! Let's eat.
What are you staring at?
Go out!
She is my child... I
won't let her die.
She wont eat if you stay here...
Go!
Please eat love.
Listen! I've replaced all
the sedatives with water.
I won't let your uncle
get away with it.
Open your eyes!
Eat! I need you to be strong...
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
Eat, Sunaina.
To fight them we need strength.
My unwinged thoughts of love...
die before they unfurl...
so I weave them in misty air...
for you to breathe
in dewy pearls.
This shivering
separation ruptured...
like autumn breath
of dead leaves...
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...
Our severed love decreed.
This sombre dusky break of dawn.
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.
This sombre dusky break of dawn.
Reminds me of starless
jaded nights.
The shrouding shadow
of this sun...
wrung tragedies on display...
As I evade to
blurry illusions...
poisoned with life's misplay.
The shrouding shadow
of this sun...
wrung tragedies on display.
As I evade to blurry illusions
poisoned with life's misplay.
This pain refuses
embrace of slumber
broken, battered and bloodied.
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...
Our severed love decreed.
Your pious love ignorant...
Imprinted and uncreased.
It broke my heart...
It broke my soul...
Our severed love decreed...
He has longer hands... stay close
and don't give him room...
find gaps to hook him
from underneath.
Take him by surprise
with uppercuts.
Boxers, shake hands.
Time keeper.
Box.
One.
Two.
Yeah...
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Knock out!
I'll tell you an easy way
to keep an eye on her...
Give me your eyes...
I'll put them on her.
Look!
Read it!
What's on it?
Headlines say 'Local Tyson...
Shravan Singh.'
Your Tyson!
Only the fortunate find
such a beautiful wife...
Wow. She is gorgeous!
How did you catch someone
so out of your league?
Boxing in India has
lost it's stance...
defence is weak...
there's no footwork.
By the last round our boxers end
up playing like wrestlers...
Our young boxers have a
bleak future ahead...
Our coaches... players... the
entire system needs overhauling.
The federation has given me the
responsibility to fix this...
I shall not break their trust.
Box.
How did they become friends?
Aren't they supposed
to fight each other?
How can they get her engaged?
I never signed the
divorce papers!
They've obviously lied...
you genius!
She's marrying the guy...
whose taillights we broke.
That sweet shop guy went
for the after-party...
same sweet shop guy... Remember?
Five bricks... new shoes? Bet?
He saw the engagement photo
and realised it was Sunaina.
He called me and I
came straight here!
Box.
Dodge him for next two rounds...
I'll make you win.
You have to knock him out...
or else Bhagwan will
beat us in points.
Stop.
Final round.
Seconds out.
Stop.
Stop.
One.
Two.
Three.
Seven.
Eight.
Box.
Stop.
One.
Two.
Stop.
Three count outs in a single round!
It's a Technical Knockout.
Blue.
How did you get here?
Lets go!
Come with me.
Look at those two bulls
sitting there...
ready to charge on us.
Just keep moving.
Where're you going so late?
Where else!
Taking her to pee outside...
she slides off in the bathroom.
Don't worry... we're
going to the fields...
will fertilise the crops.
Please tell them not
to follow us...
leave us some respect.
We can't unzip our pants anywhere,
anytime... like you men!
Quickly.
Hello.
Hold on! Coach..
I'll be right back.
Where are you? I can't
get through anyone...
neither you... nor Sunaina!
We're in a village... few
miles out of town...
at Bhagwan's ancestral home.
His boxers are
guarding the house.
He even broke her father's legs.
Please don't cry...
give the phone to Sunaina!
Sunaina! Can you hear me?
I'd promised you...
I'll fix it...
I'll come and get you!
I'm already in Quarterfinals.
As soon as I win the finals...
I'll come for you!
It'll be too late by then!
Gopal.
Hey Gopal! Wake up.
We need a car.
We have to act now... We
don't have time... Hurry up!
But act on what!
I see three men...
- three outside...
there may be more inside!
What now?
Should I leave now?
Where'll you go?
You've been righteous
for the first time...
You've brought us
to Ravana's den...
You're the Monkey God now!
Lord Rama has gone
to get Sita...
now Lakshman will go in too!
Till then you man the chariot.
Come on.
Listen...
Bring the car around
to the back...
to the empty yard!
Be careful! Be smart!
Have you read The Bhagwad Gita?
You can't win The Mahabharata
by befriending the enemy.
You've been trying to represent
India for a while now?
And you know I'm the only one
who can make that happen?
Yes.
What?
Boss... He is here.
Who names their kid 'He'?
'He' who?
Shravan.
He's here to take
your niece away.
Where are you?
He's reached the village.
Get there now!
'He' who?
He.. Shravan.
Who else!?
My eye! My eye! I
can't see anything.
Aren't you Sunaina's father?
Who are you?
Gopal!
Yes, I am Gopal!
But who are you?
You're Gopal! I'm also Gopal!
We met at Sunaina's wedding!
Where's Sunaina?
"Our union is not
easy, beloved."
"Love is not a game... beloved."
You wanted proof right?
She's proof...
They are proof...
Bhagwan broke her father's legs.
Take a look inside... Those
fallen men are also proof.
May we leave now?
What are you staring at?
Arrest him and lock
him up for good!
On what charge, Sir?
A husband has come
to get his wife...
She's leaving on her own will..
How -
- I'm telling you to...
Bhagwan Das Mishra! Arrest him!
He has threatened to kill me.
But I haven't as yet.
Now you can arrest him!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Hail Mother India!
Take a deep breath.
Show me your wounds!
Does it hurt?
Don't be stubborn! How can
we permit him to play?
I'll lose my job over it!
It's a matter of his life!
But he seems fine as of now.
The doctor's here... if he permits...
go ahead and play.
But I can play.
They won't let you.
Your left kidney is injured.
One kidney is enough...
to keep a man alive!
I've already won the battle...
all that's left to do is fight!
Bhagwan Sir...
Please try to forgive me.
Sunaina is my world... It was
my duty to fight for her.
Please don't disqualify me..
I don't want to lose
without the fight.
Let me play?
I'm begging you.
Yes.
Bhagwan Das.
I'm coming.
You carry on.
Go.
Let it go... You said you'd
even give up boxing for us.
Compete next time!
Do you...
know...
how much...
I...
love...
you!
He has two conditions.
He'll never come between
the two of you...
but you'll never speak of...
the past... nor will he.
Forget everything!
And second?
After this match... you'll
retire from boxing.
"Punched to the guts..."
"my son."
"My beloved son..."
"My son..."
"He tied a stone and
jumped in the water."
Injuries?
Jury approved.
Okay.
Blue.
Red-Blue.
Shake hands.
What happened? You
were fine yesterday.
Have you ever knocked anyone
out in the first punch?
Today you'll write history!
Game on. Time.
Box.
Hit me!
Come on.
Go ahead! Hit me!
Hit me.
Hit me.
Come on.
Stop.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Match over.
