Orphaned when he was just a boy, 
Harry Papadopoulos
came to this country with nothing.
Harry was a grafter, entering the restaurant
trade as a young man.
That's a euphemism for Greek waiter, isn't it?
Only joking Harry.
He then started the now famous Papadopoulos and Sons
doing all things Greek.
From taramasalata to olive oil
and frozen moussakas.
Which I must admit my wife and I are
partial to occasionally.
Not one to settle, 
Harry's made the move into commercial property.
Where he's about to embark on one of the most
audacious developments yet : Papadopoulos Plaza.
A 2 million square foot redevelopment 
in the heart of our great city.
Ladies and gentlemen I give you
European Entrepreneur of the Year.
Harry Papadopoulos.
That's lovely.
Now just hold it up a bit for me.
Just look at the camera.
- Little bit more, perfect.
Now, touch the vase for me
if you don't mind.
Touch it?
What a perv.
Oh, Katie... you're the p-p-p-perv.
And you're the f-f-f-freak,
- Shush!
Big smiles! Big smiles for me!
Did you really work in a restaurant daddy?
- A long time ago.
It's supposed to be a celebration!
What's the Greek word? Opa, opa?
Touch the vase.
Cheese!
Congratulations to the Prime Minister.
Sir Derek Otterly was there today,
- I don't know him.
Sir Derek? You must remember him.
- He's been to the house.
- They all blur.
That's because they're all so dull.
- Wait.
Gold doing well, tech stocks down.
Nice one, Mrs. P.
- Thanks, Dave. Do you want to stay for supper?
I'd best not, I've got some dinner at home.
That's a nice vase, isn't it?
- European Entrepreneur of the Year.
It's impressive.
Dave, did you get my cuttings?
I did mate. In the greenhouse ...
I got you a Caryopteris and a Philadelphus.
Cheers man. Thank you.
- See you later
See you tomorrow
Daddy, what did Papadopoulos and Sons borrow
for the property development?
about 300 million.
Never mind the trials and tribulations of the stock market.
Finish your supper, young man!
Nanny P!
- Eat up, or there's no pudding for you
and I made you a nice sponge.
Two, Four, Eight, Sixteen.
- All right.
32, 64, 128...
- That's enough.
Something is happening with inter-bank lending daddy.
- We'll talk about it tomorrow.
It's going to be a long summer.
Taking them to a business award ceremony 
is hardly a family day out.
My suggestion was a cottage in Lyme Regis.
Dave, I need to talk to you about James.
It's ... Look you really should be doing that 
out the back.
Ya, sorry.
Look, it's a .... He needs to complete his degree.
And this gardening ... the horticulture ... the plants
- Ya, ya.
It's a huge distraction.
I was just helping him out during the holidays.
- Well I need him to complete his studies.
  And you're diverting his attention.
And frankly it's not what I pay you for.
Please don't be so churlish.
You know, if you worked for my company,
you'd probably be fired.
- Ya.
Is there anything else?
- No. That's it.
Good night, Mr. Papadopoulos.
James?
Relax.
Calm down.
You need to learn how to ...
You really need to learn how to express yourself
more calm...
- Wanker.
Wanker!
James, can I come in?
"It's not the strongest who survive
nor the most intelligent ...
but those that are adaptable to change.
Fascinating. Charles Darwin.
Aww. Look at that!
And that's?
Did you know that the average garden contains
over 3.5 million species?
No, I didn't.
Dad, I'm not going back to it.
- But it's only a year and then
  you've got a law degree ...
Dad, I've got no intention of running
Papadopoulos & Sons.
I can't even pronounce it.
- Look.
Finish your studies.
The plants ... it's a hobby, sure.
Give yourself options. You may change
your mind about the business.
You know there a lot of creative roles now in business.
- Like what?
Like Marketing.
All right, defer the final year.
Take a year off. Why not! Fine.
But don't quit. 
Your mother would have said the same.
Would she?
Well your mother would probably have said
"Do what you feel was right"
And then we'd argue, probably.
And she'd win.
That was your mother.
At least consider deferring ...
Okay. I'll consider deferring.
Ya? Great!
Great.
So, there you are. It's not a definitely not.
What's this one called?
- That's an ivy.
Mrs. P?
Mrs.P?
Look, I'd better ....
Hey
Well done ...
For ...
Closed?
Yes, please.
Evening boss. Sorry to disturb. I work for a homeless charity...
- No thanks.
New dish cloth?
- I know how you people operate.
I've got a badge.
- No mention of a charity.
Come on boss. Give us a break.
I'm trying to earn a living here.
Look. I've got tea towels, surface cleaners, scrubbers,
brushes,  window sprays
shammies for drying the car...
Cars.
- Daddy, you need to see the news!
Hallo there , Mini-Boss.
Who is that man?
- He is .... he works for a charity.
Is it a cake fair?
- Cakes?
Did you say cakes?
Did he say cakes? 
How did you know that's what I want to do. Open up a cake shop.
- Cakes. Really!
With cupcakes, individually decorated gingerbread men,
bite size apple strudel.
Gooey fudge balls, mini-muffins
As well as your traditional fare.
It's got a business plan and everything.
It would be egalitarian
but still ... exclusive.
Sort of my mission statement really:
"Progressive People's Cake Shop"
for progressive pricing.
Very good. I know a thing or two about
the food business as well.
Really? I'm looking for investors.
- Retail's not for me I'm afraid.
A staff nightmare. They'll nick your cakes, upset your customers
and then do you for wrongful dismissal.
Ah. Thanks for the encouragement.
Let's buy something!
The news, Daddy!
How much for the ...
It's a shammy.
- Whatever, how much?
The shammy?
It's a shammy.
I'm not going to say that word.
- Why not?
'Cause it's a silly word and I don't know what it's for.
and I don't know if you are genuine.
and I'll probably never use it.
Oh, a shammy!
Come look, Daddy.
Panic, confusion and chaos.
They said it couldn't happen again ...
But today it just did
What's going on?
- Another bank collapse.
Nicholas.
Ya, I'm watching now. It's insane.
The Bank is put into liquidation.
It comes as a shock ... 
I don't know ... why don't you call him?
All right. I'll see you first thing tomorrow. Bye.
Will this have repercussions on your loan?
- That's a very good word, Theo.
Isn't it?
Daddy?
"Repercussions."
It's a good word.
Yes, sorry, yes.
It's a very good word.
They've revalued the properties.
They're calling in their guarantees.
You need to find 30 mil now.
Six months to find the rest.
And if we don't?
What happens?
They'll put you and everything you own
into administration.
Harry, you took out crazy loans.
Our business is making feta cheese, for God's sake.
You gambled it on a shopping mall.
I could really do without these comments right now.
- I am the finance director of this company, Harry.
You never listened.
It always had to be bigger. Better.
Like these offices.
We didn't need these offices.
Do you know how much we paid for that work of art up there?
200 grand.
200 grand ... for a fish.
What do you want me to do, Nick?
- Our business was profitable, Harry.
I was going to retire in two years.
I'd like to bring that forward.
You're resigning now?
The accountants are coming in.
Sorry, Harry
Greek I can't.
Greek I can't.
Nicholas!
- It's enough.
It's enough.
- Nicholas!
Can you believe that.
- Shit, fan and hitting. Hey, Fat Laki!
You know why they call this guy Fat Laki?
Oh, wow. Congratulations.
I stopped eating bread.
It's sad though.
I loved bread.
But what can you do?
This is Sophie, just relocated from our New York office.
Hello, I'm really pleased to meet you.
I'm a huge fan of Greek food.
Especially the cakes.
I love baklava.
Great.
Ship's going down and we've got baklava.
- So I take it the banks are pulling the rug?
What are the bastards proposing?
- They've demanded the three hundred million we borrowed.
Thirty by close of play.
- Sweet mother of god, they are sons of bitches.
They've taken a new position on
the value of the property development.
It's triggered the guarantees.
Can you sell it?
- It's not even a building site yet.
So it's bankruptcy.
Put something offshore I said.
- You wanted to pay taxes.
Maybe I should have been more "Greek" about it.
- Hey, it's bankruptcy, not disaster.
Accountants! When it's good they get paid ...
When it's bad they get paid.
I want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason.
He doesn't get it.
So what are the options?
- Well, the obvious is to buy back your own business.
Trick is finding the investors to back you.
And the banks will sell back to me because? ...
- Because nobody makes pink slop like you do Harry.
The banks just want a quick sale.
They have no interest in running your business.
Let's jump on it.
I'll talk to private equity firms, VCs, angels ...
The usual suspects.
We'll find someone.
What doesn't break you, makes you.
- Ah, therapy!
Don't charge me for that, will you?
Rob, don't let her charge me for that.
They're going through my things. It's disgusting!
- It's temporary, you'll get it all back.
Morning.
- Oh, hi!
Problem.
This is the kitchen.
- Fabulous finishes!
How long is this going to take?
- Most of the day, I should think.
And what are we allowed to keep?
- Ah well. According to the asset sheet. Let's see ...
Not very much.
- Little rats with their little claws.
That's quite unnecessary, Katie.
We may as well do this now.
That's a nice computer.
Don't worry, we're not going to take it.
Now!
Anything interesting?
- Stocks!
Everyone's selling. I'm buying.
Two, four, eight...
Double your numbers quietly, Theo.
And apologize.
Otherwise I'll confiscate that wretched computer
for a week.
- Sorry!
There's no easy way of doing this.
You have impeccable taste by the way.
- It's not mine.
We operate on very strict guidelines.
- We have your range of Greek dips at home, don't we Rupert?
As I was saying,
we operate on very strict guidelines.
So, what is legally ours?
- Well, the bank will let you keep 25,000 pounds in cash.
And you're each allowed one thousand pounds
in personal items.
My Westwood Gold Label cost more than that!
Such a beautiful dress. I couldn't resist looking.
- I love it too.
I'll sort something out for you.
- Thank you.
Nigel...
- You seem like such a lovely family. We hate doing this.
Nigel!
Right, so 25K in cash ...
One thousand in personal ...
Items.
What else?
Well, one thing that came up in the meeting
with HQ this morning.
The fish and chip shop.
"The Three Brothers"?
- What fish and chip shop?
That went years ago.
- The bank is unable to seize it as an asset
because of its co-ownership with a ...
Spiros Papadopoulos.
- Right.
Yes. That's his brother.
But they haven't spoken in years.
It was so strange.
Oh, James... more lemon, son.
This is so good, Mrs. P.
In all the years ...
I've never stopped thinking about you.
Or your food!
Ah, you are so charming.
Naturally.
So...
I'm sitting there, watching the telly ...
And suddenly I see
Papadopoulos & Sons.
On the tv.
- Daddy over-leveraged himself.
Look at this little Englisher.
Hey! I'm your Uncle Spiros, ey!
I'm your uncle!
I'm going to eat him, he's so cute.
Please don't eat me.
- He's just like his mother.
The little Englishman.
- That's because my mommy was English.
I know, ey!
So, I'm watching the news
and I'm thinking "What's my baby brother gone 
and done now?"
And just at that moment ...
as I'm thinking that thought,
in the same split second,
The phone rings. And it's him.
I mean, it's got to be some
kind of quantum physics there, no?
No?
Insane.
Insane.
Katie?
You're so grown up.
I can't believe this.
You were like .... just a girl.
Dumpy and spoiled.
Not that you ...
- She's still a little spoiled ...
Nanny P!
- And dumpy.
Not so dumpy.
Ah, James!
Sweet Baby James.
When you were three ...
How old was he? Three or four?
We used to play-fight. Remember?
You loved to fight.
You broke my nose.
Yeah! Fuck, that hurt!
- Spiros!
Sorry.
Duck. I said duck.
Quack, quack.
I know what you said.
- Don't tell your father.
Harry, thank you for phoning me.
No, seriously. I am so grateful.
There's ...
I know there's so much we need to sort out,
you and I.
Well.
- But we should be celebrating.
Yes.
I don't drink anymore.
Just so you know.
But you don't have to be drunk to dance.
That's what I say now.
Fantastic.
So, look. We're losing the house.
And, well, everything.
- What?
It's only temporary. I'm in negotiation with
a top corporate finance team to buy it back.
But in the meantime I need to free up some capital.
- I'll give you whatever I've got. You know I
  don't have much money
I don't want any money Spiro.
I want to sell The Three Brothers.
We'll split it 50/50.
I get enough money to pay the rent,
pay a few bills off.
And it's great for you because you get some cash to do ...
whatever it is you want to ... do.
Can't sell The Three Brothers.
- I knew it.
I knew you'd be difficult. I knew it.
You haven't changed.
- No. It doesn't feel right.
You're loving this.
- Oh Harry! I want to help.
Can't you see we're in the shit.
- Gentlemen, please!
May I suggest we sleep on this.
Before it gets out of hand.
Yes, this is good advice Mrs. P.
Harry.
Harry!
- Okay, whatever.
I couldn't sleep last night.
Not a wink!
Over and over in my mind ...
I was trying to imagine selling the shop.
Something here was saying: No.
No!
I want to help you.
All of you.
So I prayed for guidance and I asked the universe
"Please help me ...
Please help me help these people "
And as I was falling asleep not long after.
The craziest thing.
And then this dream.
My God!
There was this ...
Music.
The most incredible music.
And you and me, Harry.
Running the shop.
I woke up with tears in my eyes.
And I knew ...
Sorry, what are you going on about?
We're going to reopen The Three Brothers.
Brilliant!
Is he talking about us?
Yes. I think he is.
- There's nothing there!
Exactly. It's empty. Useless.
We'd get nothing for it.
But if we made The Three Brothers great again ...
Hey! That is our destiny!
Okay. It needs work, sure.
But destiny needs work.
You're still crazy.
We have ...
You, you have a better chance of getting through this
if we increase the value of the shop.
I'm not opening a fish and chip shop.
I'm Papadopoulos & Sons.
I'm on supermarket shelves.
What would I tell my friends?
- maybe the truth?
"I don't know ... maybe the truth."
- God. Fuck off!
F- F- Fuck you.
- Enough!
People, hear me out.
If we get it up and running again, we can sell it
as a going concern instead of an empty shop.
This deal that you're working on 
could take ages.
In the meantime, you're getting cash in and
you're saving money ...
Because it's got two bedrooms.
"The Three Brothers" is a gold mine.
Used to be.
Can be again.
- When did you become so practical?
I'll get it fixed. I'm a handyman now.
- Oh, I thought that you were a waiter Spiros?
Around too much booze, Mrs. P.
I went travelling.
Belgium, America, Brooklyn ... I ended up
managing a block of apartments in L.A.
I do painting, decorating, plumbing,
electrics, everything.
A man who can fix things.
- I've got a van.
Oh, it's all right everyone, don't panic.
He's got a van.
Let's go look at the shop.
Let me go and start working on it now.
You're out of your mind. I know what you're up to.
You want to make some money for yourself.
That's fine. It's okay.
At least you're thinking smart these days.
But don't involve us in all this.
I want to help.
- Given the current situation ...
I think it's worth considering.
What?!
I'm not opening a fish and chips shop!
I'm not!
I'm not! I'm not! I'm not!
NOT! NOT!
What?
May I have a private word?
Now ...
You're behaving like a child
- Mrs. Parrington, with all due respect ...
You're father of this family.
- I'd rather boil my own head than go back to a chip shop.
What a terrible thing to say.
Really.
He's unreliable Mrs. P.
He's irresponsible. He's a talker.
He sings. He dances. He plays the bongo drums.
He's a waiter.
He'll drive us all mad and leave us broke.
He seems reformed to me.
He doesn't drink anymore ... and he wants to help.
Moving back to a chip shop will
destroy my children's confidence.
Seeing you behave like a spoiled little brat
will do that perfectly.
We're gonna smell of fish and chips.
The children need a home.
I don't give a fig
for your bourgeois snobbery.
Look at you. Everything has
to be a drama with you Greeks.
Show some gumption man!
So many memories!
Are we really go to live in that?
I'm trying to find something good.
And? ...
No. Nothing.
Nonsense. You'll love it!
We're gonna have a crazy time.
We gonna fix this place up. I'm gonna teach you
how to do some Greek dancing ... some singing ...
We'll fry some good fish.
We'll laugh.
Good times!
Good times!
I don't believe it!
- What?
The Greeks are back.
What Greeks?
- Those Greeks.
Hello, my old friends.
Mehmet.
Find out what they're up to.
See? It looks much worse from the outside.
It's actually a fish and chip shop?
Of course it is, you spanner.
Daddy? Really?!
What's this?
This is Mr. Charles. Our lucky fish.
He helped us make the busiest chip shop in London.
I can smell the past.
Your father and I. Young!
The women. Young!
Making good money!
Wasting it.
Gambling it. Losing it.
Happy days!
It's a crack den!
- Don't worry.
Let me show you the rest.
We'll make it homey.
furniture, beds, tv. Come on.
Let me show you.
So. Here is the prep room.
Mortimer, Rolf and Jones.
Hello.
Could I speak to Rob?
He's not at his desk.
Can I take a message?
It's Harry Papadopoulos.
- Oh hi. It's Sophie.
  We met at your office the other day ...
Oh hi.
Any news?
- We're lining up interest.
Right ...
Well. I, um ...
I just need to know wh ...
I need to know ...
if this is going to work.
Rest assured. We're driving the herd to Abilene.
Sorry?
- Oh. It's an old American Midwest expression.
Are you okay, Mr. Papadopoulos?
Yup. All good.
Uh. Just keep me informed please.
- Of course.
Harry Papadopoulos called.
You should call him back.
- Let's go out.
Let's celebrate, let's find a ...
Let's find a salsa club or something.
Sorry?
- Daddy just put another pig in the bag.
New instruction, Wallinghams.
Big UK retail chain. Established.
Leave it.
Leave it to Wallinghams
Comfortably. Elegantly. Reliably.
Wallinghams!
Croydon, Greenwich, Enfield, Wimbledon,
and ding ... going into administration.
Coming to little old moi for services rendered.
O thank you. Thank you very much
God, I love an economic downturn!
Joking aside though. Five thousand laid off.
Sad. Very, very sad.
But dear sweet mother of God,
it was a shit business.
Happy days.
- Oh yeah. Hallelujah
Six?
Two, four, eight, sixteen ...
Two, four, eight ...
- Daddy, come look at this giant mushroom I found!
Coming.
Ya!
Ya, ya. ya.
Hey!
Remember up here?
We used to bring out the tables
and the chairs with the other Greeks.
What ever happened to Soula, Pani and Stavros.
Loved that crowd.
Sometimes there'd be a poker game.
Sometimes dancing. We had fun.
Did my Daddy dance?
- Yeah, I taught him.
And your mother.
- My Mummy?
Hey, please!
This is the place where
your mommy and your daddy met.
What? Up here?
- Yeah.
They talked all night.
They danced.
Yeah, there was a lot of dancing here.
Hey!
Do you want me to show you?
How 'bout it?
Spiros, please. It's not a holiday.
Just show everyone around.
What	?
I'll show you later.
You all right?
Ya.
I like the view.
I might put some plants up here.
Hello.
Do you have a light?
- You came all this way for a light?
I'm from the kebab shop across the road.
Nice.
My dad, wants me to spy on you.
Don't think he likes Greeks.
You want to go out sometime?
Yeah. All right.
I'm Mehmet
- Katie.
Shit around here isn't it?
Yeah.
Pretty much.
Catch you later.
- Yeah.
Bye.
Mortimer, Rolf and Jones.
Oh, hi dad!
Yeah, I got them.
They're beautiful. Thank you.
All right, put her on.
He's here.
- Right, just a second.
Hi Mom.
Thanks for the flowers. They're lovely.
There was nothing wrong with New York.
Yes, you can stay friends with Matt,
And Bill and Susan.
Mom, look, I've got a meeting.
I don't know just some meeting.
Yes, I promise I will.
I love you.
Okay, bye.
Parents!
Is Matt your, um ...
- Ex.
A bit of a tosser, yeah?
I wouldn't say tosser exactly.
We just wanted different things.
- Yada, yada, yada. Yeah, I hear ya.
Just like me and my ex.
She was keen and everything, but ...
I don't know ... her forward thinking
sort of killed the romance.
It's good to have these little chats, you know?
Shouldn't always be about work.
Society is so work obsessed. Tragic.
Right. Back to work
Some big names.
- Pap & Sons is still a cash cow.
What's the potential deal structure?
- That's the pisser.
You'd still be key running the business, but...
But?
- Money isn't cheap Harry.
These guys will want at least 95% of the company.
Leaving me with nothing.
Eh, I'd do the same thing.
I'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons?
Get a salary? Get my house back?
My children's future?
- Beats fish and chips.
You'd be working for someone else.
- I'd be working for someone else.
By the way, I'm not actually running
a fish and chip shop.
Just helping my brother re-launch.
- Sure.
Listen. There may be another way.
It came up in conversation with
the Norske Velconan Bank.
It would be along the lines of a straight
loan to buy back the business.
- Why would they lend to me?
Well, let's ask them.
Do you want me to look into it?
Sure. No choice.
- Okay, cool.
Gotta go, got an emergency.
But get this ...
A high tech portable toilet company
that has literally gone down the tubes.
An internet-ready, wireless crapper
with a waterproof keyboard and screen.
Because taking a dump needed an overhaul.
So, somebody's got to bury them.
in nomine Patre, Spiritu Sanctu etc, etc.
Gotta love a down turn.
Laters.
I think what you are currently doing
with your brother sounds ... liberating.
I've liberated myself from my
last 25 grand in a disused chip shop.
But it's like a start-up.
Isn't that the most exciting phase
of any venture?
Taking a bit of risk. Developing your
product and your services.
Learning about your market.
Look. Some of the largest companies
on the planet never make a profit.
Like a real profit ... It's all accounting
tricks and leveraged debt.
What I'm trying to say is ...
Does it matter if the business is a small one ...
As long as it makes a profit and
the people who work there are happy?
What are you doing working in a place like this?
- This is only temporary ...
I got divorced recently.
Came to London for a fresh start.
I'm actually looking into setting up my own business.
Well I'm sorry about that.
About the divorce, I mean.
I've been meaning to ask.
Can I come and visit your shop sometime?
There isn't one.
- When it's up and running.
It's a chip shop. It's hot. On your feet all hours.
Verbal abuse from costumers on a Friday night,
I wasn't applying for a job Harry,
I just wanted to stop by ...
It's late!
What are you doing, little man?
Trading.
I watch trends ...
making trades based on patterns.
I don't even look at the fundamentals.
- Fundamentals?
You know: capital employed,
gearing ratio, etc.
Not even profit or turnover.
It's short term, but I can spot a trend.
I know what's gonna happen.
- So you can see the future?
And?
- Same as the past.
The pursuit of order from chaos.
I'm done for today.
Ah, Theo, Theo, Theo.
speaking Greek
Sweet dreams.
- Uncle Spiros?
You knew my mummy?
Yes.
She was ... She was beautiful.
And she was very kind to me.
I wish I had my mummy sometimes.
It's very hard for you.
- I'd have made her laugh Uncle Spiros.
You make me laugh.
I've come out with some classics ...
Real gems.
Wasted on this family.
You are something else!
We can hear everything.
Don't fall for him Spiros.
He's a little tinker.
Say the magic release poem.
- No.
Yes, actually say the magic release poem.
No!
Theo Papadopoulos is a Hippopotamus
He's always making such a fuss.
from his toe to bottomus.
Ah, your kids!
They're something.
Don't worry.
I'm not too religious.
I'm a lapsed Buddhist. I do
everything a good Buddhist does ...
Except abstinence.
Ear plugs?
Come on.
This is a fantastic thing.
Did you ever imagine ... 30 years ago?
Back here?!
No.
Remember, how excited we felt
when we first got this place?
It feels like that again!
My gut says Pollock instead of cod.
What do you think?
- I should never have taken out that loan.
We'll talk fish after we fix this place.
Katie's got some good thoughts.
Says we should keep the old look.
And she had some beautiful
ideas about the uniforms.
But then you know the potential yield of the plaza,
Papadopoulos Plaza ...
Fully developed with a thousand year lease.
I'm telling you, Spiro...
It was good.
I'd have been worth a fortune.
Worth, I don't know...
One billion five, one billion six.
One billion six!
Big numbers, Spiro.
Big, big numbers.
We were children when we came to the UK.
With nothing.
We start again.
Fat Laki, the weight you lost
is an inspiration.
Phil the Till, you've helped many Greeks
with your tax-friendly till machines.
Hey, only two things are certain in life.
Death and taxes.
Unless you're Greek!
Then it's only death!
Nikos, Kyriaco, Androniki, Loula,
Uncle Panikos, Aphrodite, Maria
And, of course, Father Jimmy. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Didn't Father Jimmy get done for
selling illegal copies of "Rambo"?
He owns three liquor stores
in Palmers Green.
He always hated me.
People, hello.
Sorry, hi.
Uh, just want you to know this is a
temporary situation for the family.
I'm currently in negotiation with a
top corporate finance team.
about re-acquiring the assets of
Papadopoulos & Sons. That's it.
What did he say?
- He's had some sort of breakdown.
Tragic.
- James! Music!
Thank you.
I officially announce the renovation
of the "Three Brothers".
You're supposed to do that when you launch something.
- To hell with convention.
Good luck
Now tell us.
Don't rush me. It's been a long time
since I had meat like this.
What's he doing?
He's assessing the competition.
Tell us
There's a reason why
Hassan is still in business.
Texture - Very good. Way above average.
Meat content - High.
Mechanically recovered cheap rubbish?
You wish!
This is a quality donner.
Nicely cooked ...
With all the right combination of herbs.
Beautiful!
It doesn't mean we can't take them on.
- No. I'm not saying we can't.
Yes?
Sorry. I ...
What do you want?
That's a lot of Greeks.
What?
- We're going out.
- Not too late.
Well, she is eighteen.
We'll make a better product at
a cheaper price with larger portions.
We'll lose money on the kebabs in the sort term.
Put the Turks out of business within the year.
Make our margins on the fish
And when the rest of this
crummy street's packed up .....
We'll raise our prices
and cut our portion sizes.
The entrepreneur has spoken.
Hey. It's temporary, but as long as
we're here we'll do some business.
You know, when he was a little boy ...
he'd come home from school and sit there.
Just like that.
Who was the third?
Brother?
- Michael.
He died in the fire with our parents,
your grandparents, in Cyprus.
In the war between the Greeks
and the Turks.
How did you both escape?
Spiros climbed down
and Michael, who was six ...
Yes.
Dropped me down.
I was just a baby.
I caught him.
But Michael, he ...
I told Mihalis to jump, but ...
He ran right back into the house.
I'll never know why.
One night everything changes.
He probably wanted to save
his mom and dad.
You know what?
I never thought about that.
You could be right.
Yeah.
You're a wise boy, James.
Your soul is old.
Tell me, this has always been a big
question for me for many years.
Do you think I could've done something else?
For Michael?
- No, you were holding a baby.
Yeah.
- And how old were you?
I was nine.
You were only a boy ...  like Theo.
H?
Hello?
What's wrong with him?
Hey!
Don't worry.
It's temporary.
Excuse me.
Did I say something wrong?
He was only nine.
I'd never thought about how young he was.
I brought you this.
Tea.
James?
Come here.
Sit down.
I've let you and your brother
and your sister down.
- Dad!
I made a promise to your mother that
I'd take care of you.
- And you're doing that.
This is humiliating for you.
- Dad, we'll get through this.
I ...
I don't know ... King Lear.
I don't know the story.
- Well, um ...
King Lear loses everything.
Absolutely everything.
He finds himself in the middle
of a storm.
With nothing ...
But nothing.
And ...
His kids ... they hate him.
They think he's a prick.
- What happens to him?
Well, uh, he dies.
But it has to end like that.
Because it's a tragedy.
I'm sorry about your plants.
- I can grow new ones.
Why you didn't bring more with you?
I didn't want to get in the way.
You're such a sweet boy.
Get that from your mother.
Your stammer's getter better.
You know what?
I'm going to go get your plants.
Now. From the house.
What? Right now?
Yeah.
I'm going to go get your plants.
Like King Lear, yeah?
Uh, yeah.
That's awesome.
There you go.
Oh, no!
No. No. No.
.
That's perfect.
Daddy!
- Hello.
What's going on?
- We're making ...
Batter.
- Uncle Spiros' special mix.
That's all I could find.
- Thank you.
It's very late.
I said they could help.
- It's a holiday.
Uncle Spiros said I could make
beer and vodka batter.
It doesn't sound very good.
Hey, you can stay up.
It's the holidays.
Tomorrow we'll look through the newspapers.
We'll pick out some stocks.
How's that grab you?
- Natural resources is a good buy.
Hey, wait. Show us your frying skills.
Yeah, I was telling them how you
were born with a timer in your head.
How you fried to perfection every time.
- Not tonight.
Come on, Dad.
Show us how to fillet a fish.
- Go on daddy.
Ya, H, come on.
Show us.
Show us.
Show us.
Show us. Show us. Show us. ...
You should really be thinking about bed,
all of you.
Good night	.
Bed?
All right. So. Where are we going?
City. Get a loan.
Get the business back. Get the house back.
Does this suit look all right?
Yeah. It's a suit.
Oh! Doesn't ... I don't know ... fit.
I don't believe it. They're kissing.
Kids. Come on.
- In the street?
They're smoking. They're hanging out.
Do they? ... Are they? ...
What?
- They screwing?
No. They're just kissing.
Got to get out of this place.
Come on, he's a sweet guy.
- Out! Family's in the gutter.
You're over-reacting Harry.
- The thought of her pregnant.
In a kebab shop
Harry, don't worry about Katie.
She can look after herself.
What are you doing?
I've got something to say.
About Katie? Is she pregnant?
- No.
Oh God, have you got ...
Have you got cancer?
No.
No, just ...
Just bear with me.
So. Here goes.
After years of abuse, on my behalf
and unacceptable behaviour,
I reached a moment of clarity.
Actually this was two years ago.
I'd like to apologize for the hurt I've caused.
- What? Now?
There were aspects of my behaviour
which was unacceptable
Which includes, but is not limited to ...
- Why now?
I've been carrying this ...
Well, if you don't want to hear,
we can do it later.
- No. Now's fine. Now's good.
Just ...
Skip that ...
I have abused your generosity
I agree with that statement.
When we were children, and got to London
I looked after you ...
got you ready for school
made you do your homework
I taught you to cook, ride a bike ...
Speak Greek. Dance.
Why don't you speak Greek, Harry?
You were reading a list.
I fought with Steven Klein when he accused you
of stealing his orthopedic shoe
Remember that?
- Yeah.
Did you take it?
- No.
You can tell me now.
- I didn't steal the shoe.
Are you going to read all of that?
I don't have to.
Why did it go wrong with us, Spiro?
We may as well get to it.
Why did you turn against me
after I left the shop?
I never turned against you.
- That's what it felt like.
I was jealous of you.
You were my brother.
Brothers get jealous.
You were more than a brother.
You were my life.
And then you left.
Gone.
I set up the business.
I wasn't going to stay in the sh...
You could have come with me.
Harry, you were so fast.
You were like a plane ...
Like a supersonic jet.
But I gave you everything you ever wanted.
Did I ever once turn you down in all the years
after I left the business?
And after it went bust.
But it was never enough.
Every week something new.
Writing a cheque to ...
I don't know, you had some weird friends.
Who is that bloke with the pin head,
 kept turning up at the house?
- None of my friends anymore.
And then drunk at Elizabeth's funeral.
And your big tell-it-as-it-is speech.
I heard about it.
Well. That was it. For me. For us.
You were right to cut me off.
- She never had a bad word for you, Elizabeth.
She always forgave you. And she made
me forgive you.
Every time.
Yes. She did.
I always had a way back when she was with us.
Elizabeth was so good to me.
She was our world.
She was our world.
I'm sorry. I can't ...
It's okay H.
- I've got to get to this meeting.
It's an important meeting.
It's okay to miss her.
Oh, man.
Just give me a minute.
With the help of Lars
and the Norske Velconan Bank
we aim to buy Pap & Sons back
from the receiver.
Also, Harry, I have to say,
that there's an intuitive bond
between the Greek and the Nordic people.
Maybe the first Vikings were descended
from the ancient Greeks
Somewhere in the deepness of time.
So ...
...Wagnerian!
Ya?
We should point out the new approach.
To buy Papadopoulos & Söns
but divest the food manufacturing
side of the business.
Divest the food manufacturing?
What else is there?
Sell off the food but keep the property
Papadopoulos Plaza.
It's going to be worth a fortune!
It's not what I had in mind.
- It's an asset breakup.
Tusk. Tusk, yah? Makes us
sound like barbarians.
With the new loan you buy back your old assets.
and then sell off the brands in the Pap & Sons stable.
And you know how to squeeze the value, Harry.
That's a breakup.
- Please. I know what it is.
The pita bread, the cakes.
They get sold to a baker.
The halloumi and feta to a dairy company.
I love your halloumi.
Grilled! It's ...!
The sell-off value of these brands 
will exceed the new loan.
My bank will get its money back
faster than you can say "Knife"
- And what do you get?
Lars wants fifty percent of the plaza development.
Which is what will remain
after the debts have been settled.
So you get fifty percent of the development
for free?
- Sure, yeah.
But you get fifty percent of the same development
yeah. Also for free.
What do you want, Harry?
- I want my food business back.
Guys, guys, guys. Reality check.
Harry. It's not going to happen.
Okay. The best you can hope for is to
work with Lars here and save something.
Can't say no.
Okay, so I need to take this to the board.
Take two, three months.
It seems criminal to buy the business back
only to break it up.
Can I just point out that you are skating,
figuratively speaking, on thin, fucking ice.
I'll do whatever the bank wants.
- Okay.
Harry, we are going to take this to the hoop.
Three points!
Taking out a loan to pay off a loan.
So you can re-mortage a property.
It's got nothing to do with business.
It's got nothing to do with making stuff.
I get my life back.
- No. You get a loan for some land.
My children get their lives back.
I'm sorry.
This isn't very professional.
Do you give all your clients a hard time Sophie?
No.
Just the interesting ones.
Have you got five minutes?
- Yes, of course.
I just want to talk about the shop
And make sure my brother has the right plan
before I go.
Okay. Let's grab a coffee.
So, it's thirty percent on material.
the fish, the potatoes, the packaging. etc.
Would you include energy? Light? Heat?
Yes. But not rent because we already
own the building.
Okay. And thirty percent on labour.
- Yes.
So it's 30/30/30, classic restaurant model.
- That's right.
What are your weaknesses?
The price of fish can 
vary dramatically.
Can you vary the menu?
You don't want to complicate it.
It doesn't have to be complicated, Harry.
What are your fears?
- My fears?
Just that it won't work out.
That fish and chips has maybe
had its day.
No. Hang on a second.
Fish and Chips. It's a British classic!
Much more than just a quick meaningless experience.
Something to be savoured.
Just think of the soft white cod flakes
gently falling away as your fork pierces
the hard crunchy shell of the golden batter.
The rich smell of the fryer's delight,
the tangy smack of salt and
vinegar on your lips.
Hell yeah!
I'd pay for that.
We should talk about ...
We should talk about accounting packages.
- Yeah. We should.
What?
This time last year I was in Malibu.
- We'll go tonight!
It's not a night club, it's America.
Look. The shop's where I'm from.
It's not where I'm going to end up.
My dad must have said that to my mum once.
Maybe even on this bridge.
- See. Look where he ended up.
So what's your plan.
- Property. I've got an eye for it.
I'll probably be a pop star one day.
- Cool.
Yo.  yo.  yo. It's time to die.
Yo yo blue butterfly.
He was fat. he was bloated.
He was fatally attracted to my light bulb.
That is wild sick!
I wrote something for you too.
It's a poem. It's called - 
"Sometimes I Want for Nothing Else."
Just you and me,
in an ever expanding universe,
sharing a cup of tea,
sometimes I want for nothing else.
Fuck.
You're amazing.
We start from the side fin
on the top here.
And cut in one move 
all along the fish to the tail.
Lovely. Come and try.
Fresh fish. Lovely hot chips.
Delicious fish. Come and try.
Little boy!
Battered inside.
Special chip for you.
And one for you.
Fish and chips. Come and try.
We batter our own fish.
We make beautiful fresh fish inside.
Sir, have a chip. Have a fish.
No? None for  you.
Come and try! Come and try!
It's not just fish and chips.
- There's room for all of us.
What do you want, Hassan?
Remember when we were children? 
And we were friends?
We weren't Greeks. Turks.
Respectfully, I would like you to 
take your kebabs off the menu.
This is a fish and chip shop.
What do we get?
I won't do fish.
You don't do fish, Hassan.
- You're going to put us on the street.
It's business.
- It's not about business!
Perhaps you wouldn't be like this
if we were Greeks.
I tell you what.
We'll take kebabs off the menu ...
if you ask your son to stay away
from my daughter.
More Tea?
- No. Thank you.
This is very difficult.
- Come on. It's easy.
My son is his own man.
- Right. Then no deal.
Is it because he's Turkish? Because he's a Muslim?
- No. I don't have a problem with that.
Harry's not like that.
- Because he works in a kebab shop, is that it?
Yeah. Harry's more like that.
I'd ask you, both of you, to respect
a man's aspirations for his daughter.
I have similar aspirations for my son.
Spiro? Perhaps you should remind your brother
where he is now.
Tell him to look around.
Perhaps he still sees a big mansion
with gardens and servants.
Well I don't.
But more importantly. Neither does my son.
- This is only temporary.
  We'll be gone in a couple of months.
I hope so.
It's going to be a very long couple of months.
- For both of us.
Say cheese!
So here we are.
Here we are.
I'm sure it will be good news.
If it's good news, Spiro I want you to have the shop.
All of it.
Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros again?
- Of course we will.
Who's going to help me to run the store?
I'm going to need you little man.
I expect Uncle Spiros will always
find you a holiday job here.
Hello.
Lars, yeah.
I'm just ... I'm just.
What is it?
- Did you get the loan?
Bad news I'm afraid.
- Really?
Yeah.
We're going home. We got it!
We're going home.
- Congratulations.
What's wrong?
We're leaving.
We're out of here.
We got the loan.
We should be celebrating.
- He's right.
It's a good day.
You ... You ...
Made it!
You're a survivor.
Sorry.
What is it with you, Spiro?
Why can't you be happy for me?
Whenever I have any kind of success
you always have to stamp on it.
Where are you going?
- I am happy for you.
I am.
What is it?
What's wrong?
There is this ...
He looks dead to me.
No, he's not dead. He's sleeping.
He's still sleeping
Like ...
Sleeping Beauty?
- Yes.
That's a good way of looking at it.
Sorry.
I hope I'm not ...
- No. No. Come on in.
James? James!
And take the uh ...
I heard the news and I really wanted
to bake something ...
So I made a Greek Easter cake.
Don't ask.
- No, that's really ...
lovely. Thank you very much.
We'll have some of that.
James.
He's in a mild coma apparently.
and we have to talk to him
and play music
James, put the ...
Turn the music ...
Hey, wake up!
The accountant's here. You've got to wake up.
James!
- Jesus Christ!
Katie!
- It won't turn off.
You're such a spanner.
- Fuck off slag.
Katie! James!
- Let me do it!
Wait, I felt something.
Katie, get the doctor.
I don't want to ask.
Oh, for fuck's sake. I'll do it.
- James!
Excuse me...
Doctor I felt something just now, 
a gripping movement.
Anything else?
- No, just a slight squeeze.
Is that a sign?
- It could be a decorticate response.
  It's difficult to tell.
Right.
How long's he going to be like this?
He suffered a heart attack.
It's hard to predict.
You should all take a break.
I am sorry about him.
Yeah. Okay. We'll leave it to you.
Say goodbye to Uncle Spiros.
Come on, it's okay.
Would you mind staying around, Sophie?
- Of course.
So he saved me twice. Once in
the fire, and once after the bank.
I was always embarrassed
by him you know.
By this thing that he does.
But the thing that he does,
it's a good thing really.
These last few months ...
This year actually ...
This whole year. The whole year.
What a year!
And yet ...
I've never felt so alive ...
I've never felt so engaged.
Why is that?
I mean why? I'm frying chips!
I love him.
I've always loved him.
And I love my children.
I love ...
I love my life. I love it!
Why is that? Why do I love it now?
What was wrong with it before?
It's okay.
It's a crazy, crazy world.
It's up. It's down.
You fight, you win, you lose..
Become exhausted, then you leave.
There's no logic.
There's no logic. It's insane.
The whole thing.
No, no, Spiros.
- I'll get someone.
Hello.
You have to let me go.
It's good.
Michael's with us.
Michael.
Mihalis was always there.
Always with us.
Always.
Three brothers.
When I was a little boy ...
you cooked for me, 
every time I came home.
They were good times, Spiro.
Thank you.
Good life.
Now you understand.
You're a great guy!
Did you do this?
It was for you and Uncle Spiros.
And Mum.
Thank you, James.
This is the ivy you saved that night.
We meet again.
Did you know about this?
They can all go back to the house if you want.
The plants are easy to move.
But they're also very happy ...
to grow here as well. If we choose to stay.
It's whatever you want to do, Daddy.
We're all really proud of you.
Thank you.
Theo. Good day at school?
- Very good day.
Impressed the teacher with his ability
to solve quadratic equations.
That is fantastic!
- Your friends are outside.
As you won't come to me, I thought I'd come to you.
- I'm not changing my mind, Rob.
I just want to talk.
Tell me this is a joke.
I don't want to do the deal.
Harry, you have seriously lost the plot
on this one.
It just doesn't feel right.
- We worked hard on this!
If he doesn't want to do the deal.
He doesn't want to do it.
Shut up!
- Hey!
No need for that.
- I don't understand.
I've got everything I want. And I've got no debt.
That feels good.
When I lock up my shop at night, it feels good.
Got no debts, no loans.
I own it, 100%
Come on.
A percentage of something that could
be worth millions.
You'd walk away from that?
For a chip shop?
- Yeah. Right now, yeah I would.
And I'm with my children.
And that's ...
Can't put a price on that, Rob.
And I'm having fun.
We're having fun.
Come back to the shop
and let me cook you something to eat.
Go on. We're doing great business.
I'm actually thinking of expanding.
That's ah...
That's good, Harry.
That's very good. I'm happy for you.
If this is success.
What is success, Rob?
What is it?
We've both had it. What is it?
Is it the share price.
Is it the profit earnings ratio?
Is it a beautiful car?
You tell me, Harry. You've had it all.
- Yeah, I have. And I can tell you.
Success ...
is ...
the joy you feel.
That's it. That's all it is.
Success is the joy you feel.
Come on. Let's go.
I don't think so.
Okay, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
I don't care about that.
I just don't want to work for you anymore.
Good luck people.
Best fish and chips in London.
- Call me when you want to go public.
I just quit my job.
Yup. I think you did.
I'm just trying to work out ...
what I'm feeling.
And?
Bag of chips?
Ladies and gentlemen. Meet our new bookkeeper.
Hello.
You may have to take a few shifts
behind the counter.
Well. Got to learn the business from the inside.
Get the girl a Three Brothers coat.
- Yes, boss.
We are going to build a great business.
From today.
I'm so excited.
- Good times, eh?
I think so.
Katie, tell Hassan to meet me outside.
Laki, bring the kebab.
Hassan?
Thanks for coming.
Laki?
Kebabs are off the menu.
You are a good man. Thank you.
We must celebrate.
The Greek way. Yes?
Come on.
- Oh no.
Someone get some plates.
Get everyone.
No I can't. I actually can't.
I ...
No, I really don't know.
I just don't know how.
Make it up!
- Come on Harry.
I want to learn too.
Teach us all how to dance.
Oh Dad!
What are you doing?
- I think I'm going to dance.
Then I'll teach you all.
- Go on, Daddy!
It's been a long time since I did this.
Amazing how it just all comes back to you.
This is ...
Hassan!
Theo, come! Daddy's making the most delightful
fool of himself.
