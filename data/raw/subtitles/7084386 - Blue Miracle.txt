Papa?
Papa!
What?
It's Tweety. He's gone again.
Okay.
Tweety? Tweety?
Mama?
Hey, last three boys
to breakfast,
toilet cleaning duties for a week.
Oh my God! Venegas!
Oh! Oh!
- And, and, and...
- Whoo!
Goal!
Oye! I just mopped that floor.
Guys, no soccer in the house.
I already told you.
No respect, huh?
Becca, you can't expect street kids
to learn manners overnight.
You've had 20 years to learn, Omar.
Mmm. Okay.
Okay, I gotta go into the city
to pick up some things for the truck.
Need anything?
Eggs and a few onions.
Eggs? I just bought eggs.
Should I stop feeding the kids
then? I didn't know that was an option.
I'm just saying, eggs are expensive.
I mean, maybe we can find
something cheaper to feed them.
How about sand?
See, that's what I love about you.
You're a problem solver.
Hey, Tweety.
- Hey, Papa Omar.
- Hey, mijo.
Mijo, um...
you can't keep running away, mijo.
I know it's hard.
Your mom's not coming back.
Hey.
You wanna know what helps me
when I'm having a hard time?
A nail?
This isn't just some nail.
This is a miracle nail.
Do you wanna know how it works?
Mmm, okay.
Okay, so,
when I'm struggling with something,
you know, I just... I write it down
on a piece of paper, okay?
And then I just take this nail,
and I hammer it up against the door.
And pow!
God hears me every time.
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah. I mean it. I mean it.
Next time you're having a hard time,
you just pray to God,
ask him for help, and pray hard, okay?
And pretty soon, all that bad stuff,
it'll start to feel like a dream.
Like it never happened.
I never seen you hammering notes anywhere.
Do you want the nail or not?
I mean, I guess.
All right. Just take it.
Come on. Go. Yeah. Go play.
Why don't you get in the truck?
I'll be back, okay? I'll be right back.
- Omar.
- Berto.
Este huerco, pretty sure he's an orphan.
Caught him down at the marina
stealing some gringo fisherman's watch.
- Mmm.
- Trying to get it back for him, sabes?
You know how these kids are.
Thought maybe he'd talk to you.
I'll talk to him.
Did you hit this kid?
I questioned him.
Hey, you already ate, I'm sure,
pero my wife, Becca,
made some chilaquiles.
And I'm not gonna lie,
they were a little crispier than I like,
and the cheese
was a little saltier than usual.
But, nah, you probably
don't even like chilaquiles.
Yeah.
Even if you did, it would be hard for you
to eat 'em with that watch in your mouth.
All right, the way I see it,
you got one of two choices.
You can either come with me
and return the watch and apologize,
or you can go with Officer Berto.
I want my chilaquiles.
Mmm.
I'm Omar, but the boys call me Papa Omar.
I ain't calling you "papa," güey.
Okay. So, what's your name?
Moco.
Like...
...boogers?
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.
Okay, Moco.
You know, you could join us.
- Join you?
- Yeah. At Casa Hogar.
I could really use your help
with the younger boys.
I ain't no babysitter.
I only look out for myself.
- Mmm. By stealing.
- Stealing is bad.
So is interrupting, escuincle.
Out of curiosity,
what were you gonna do with that watch?
- I was gonna sell it, güey.
- Mmm.
I want some Nikes.
Nice ones with the red laces, a huevo.
With a matching red hat. Bien padre.
Oh, sounds like you're trying
to impress the wrong people.
What you know about it, fresa?
All I'm trying to say is,
if you wanna make your life better,
you gotta do what you know is right
every single day.
I mean, no matter what anybody thinks,
even when it's hard.
And that is how you get ahead.
Sí. And maybe if I work really hard,
I'll be able to drive around the orphans
in a broke-down truck like you.
I want blue Nikes.
There is a calling inside every man.
In his heart. A call to greatness.
Now, most men,
they don't follow that call.
They pretend it isn't there.
They drown it out with game shows,
or quarterly reports,
or kids' Little League baseball games,
but that's not you, is it, Greg?
You follow that call.
I can tell that about you.
It's Gary, actually.
Yeah. Well, I can tell you right now
that you're the kind of person
that likes to stand out.
You see those trophies there?
Those are first-place trophies
from the Bisbee Black & Blue,
the most prestigious fishing tournament
in the world.
And you know what
those trophies tell people?
- That you're a good fisherman.
- Mm-mm.
Those trophies tell people
that I am the best
at whatever I choose to do.
That I'm a winner.
Now, isn't that the message
that you're trying to send, hmm?
Isn't that why you're here today?
So that you could catch
one of those big blue marlins
and mount that beast on the wall
behind your mahogany desk, huh?
- Am I right?
- That's right.
Now, while those other hedge fund managers
are eating dragon rolls
or working on their golf game,
you're gonna be able to strut
into that conference room Monday morning,
and you're gonna be able to say, "Hey!"
"I did battle with that leviathan
this weekend, and I won."
"What'd you do?"
Huh?
That's money in the bank.
You understand what I'm saying?
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah?
- I do.
- You ready to do this?
This is it. This is exactly it.
- This is what I want.
- All right.
I need you to sign this.
I'm gonna get you a pen.
Now, look, I take full payment upfront.
And I'm... I'm guaranteed
to take home a marlin, right?
I will give you the best odds of anybody
in Cabo. How about that?
Right, right. I just mean that...
'Cause I heard that some other captains,
you know, they... they can guarantee
that I take home a marlin,
you know, whether or not we catch one, uh...
Well, for more money, of course.
Wait. You want me to get you a fish
that somebody else caught?
- Well, I mean, just like you said...
- I don't do that.
- It's about perception.
- That would be cheating. I don't do that.
- Okay, I'm sorry. Forget it.
- I need... Get off my boat.
- Can we just...
- Get off my boat, Gary.
Forget I said that. Okay? Just forget...
- Get off my boat, Gary.
- All right, all right. Please.
Get... Get off the dock, Gary!
Get back to your country club!
That's him.
Excuse me.
- Not interested.
- What?
Whatever you're selling,
you're hassling the wrong gringo.
"Oh Captain. My Captain"?
Give me that.
You keep that punk off my boat.
Hey, man. He returned the watch.
If you just give him a chance
to apologize...
He also pissed in my favorite coffee mug.
He... He'll get you a new mug.
Let me tell you something.
You can return the watch,
you can replace the mug,
but you can never ever un-drink urine.
Hey.
Hey, look, man. I'm trying to teach
this kid about owning his mistakes.
So if you could just
let him apologize, man. I really...
You better get out of here.
Storm's coming.
Big development
this afternoon.
We told you yesterday that Hurricane Odile
was heading west out into the Pacific.
According to reports,
it looks like the storm
has changed directions
and is actually heading right towards us,
probably reaching land later tonight.
And with winds up to 100 miles per hour,
they're saying this could be
the biggest storm we've seen in decades.
So buckle up, Cabo San Lucas,
because it looks like we're in for a ride.
I'll serve you more when I come back,
okay? But I have to serve everyone.
- Hey, Wiki, you kept count? He kept count.
- Why are you asking Wiki?
- He's smart.
- He's not smart, I'm smart.
- You know the definition?
- My name's Wikipedia.
Caray. Tuna again?
I'm growing fins eating in this place.
Hey, Geco, I'm right here.
Oye, beats eating from a dumpster, verdad?
Technically, this is mackerel.
A close relative of tuna.
"Technically, this is mackerel."
Ain't nobody cares, freak.
Hey! He ain't a freak, baboso.
But for real, Wiki, nobody cares.
Okay, okay. Atención!
All right. Listen up, guys.
It is time to earn your keep.
As some of you guys have heard,
there's a storm that's
gonna reach the coast in a few hours
and it's gonna hit us
a little later tonight.
But there's nothing to be scared of.
But Casa Hogar is our home,
so we have to do our part to protect it.
That's why I've got good news,
and I've got great news.
We never have to eat mackerel again?
The good news is we're gonna skip chores
today to prepare for the storm.
The great news is we just received
a donation of 500 sandbags.
So after we get done eating,
we can line them up around the building
to protect from flooding.
You think that carrying bags of sand
is great news to us?
Oye, we're orphans, not idiots.
He looks like
he has a "narcolupes," güey.
Do you mean narcolepsy?
And no, I don't think so.
Sí, güey. He's like those goats
that pass out when they get scared.
I ain't scared, idiota.
I just don't wanna stare
at your ugly face all night.
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with being afraid.
But we're all safe here. Verdad, Omar?
Yeah, that's right.
But what about Chico and Burro?
What, mi amor?
They're his little street friends.
They live under a tarp.
Caray. A tarp?
Oye, Tweety, your friends
are on a magic carpet ride right now.
Geco.
For real though.
There are a lot of kids out there.
I mean, it doesn't seem fair
that we get to be in here
while they have
to be on the streets, verdad?
I mean, why did we get so lucky?
Well, maybe we ain't.
- What does that mean, güey?
- I mean, as far as I can tell,
there ain't a lucky person in this room.
Geco.
Maybe God just wanted to get
all the unluckiest kids into one building
so he could crush us all at once...
Yeah, Geco...
Papa!
Oh, watch out for the glass, guys.
- Ay, caray. That's really disappointing.
- What?
The mackerel didn't get ruined.
Caray.
How are we gonna play soccer?
- We don't even play soccer.
- We do play soccer.
I'm the best one here.
No. I'm... I'm way better.
Maybe we can fix this,
and then we can one-v-one.
I turned off the breakers.
I'll keep the kids
out of the standing water.
- How much food do we have left?
- Hello?
- About a week.
- This is Tweety.
Maybe two with the cans in the shed.
- Yeah, he's right here.
- Who is it, Tweety?
- Sí.
- We can fix this.
It's for you.
- Yeah.
- Oh, come on.
Hello, this is Omar.
Oh, hello, Mr. Castillo.
Yes, sir. I meant to call you back,
but it's just been d...
Yes, I did get the letters.
What does that mean?
Geco.
Hi.
All right, you guys hang here.
Wiki, what's the Bisbee?
Bisbee Black & Blue.
The world's biggest fishing tournament.
Best teams in the world
compete for millions in prizes.
Bisbee's Black & Blue's
never canceled in 30 years.
We're not gonna start now.
Storm or no storm.
Yeah, yeah. I've got him here.
He's just finishing another call.
- Yeah, okay. Just hold on one sec.
- Yeah.
- Forget about the website.
- Hey, Omar. The kids okay?
Oh, yeah, they're great, they're great.
What... What's going on here?
Oh, you know, the storm just scared away
some of our international teams,
and so my brother decided to waive
the entrance fee for the local fishermen,
which makes my life...
That's why I'm calling you myself,
so you can hear it directly from me.
The tournament will proceed as planned.
Tricia, I can come back if...
- Give me Fitzpatrick's cell number.
- No, hold on.
Omar, what do you need?
We have flooding in the house.
You know, if we could borrow a bilge pump,
it'd be really... We'd appreciate it.
Bilge pump? I mean, yeah. Sure, of course.
Let's go talk to Quique.
I really hate to ask you this, but...
Omar, is everything okay?
What do you mean? What's going on?
I was wondering
if you could talk to the bank for us.
The bank?
We just need a little more time
to pay what we owe.
And if you could put in a good word
at the bank...
How much do you owe exactly?
$117,000.
Oh boy.
Okay. All right.
Well, how much time do you need?
They... They gave us 30 days,
but, uh, we lost some donors and...
- I'll look into it and see what I can...
- How's the storm?
- Oh no.
- Oh.
A little late.
Wade?
Hey, Biz. Feels like old times.
Only you're older and fatter.
Wade, old buddy, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you don't qualify for this list.
What are you talking about? The radio said
no entry fees for local captains.
Local fishermen.
You're from San Diego, Wade.
You cannot be serious.
That was 25 years ago.
Well, just look at this list.
Do you see anybody on this list
that's won the Black & Blue twice?
Do you? Well, there's me.
Hey, anybody in this room
won the Black & Blue twice?
What about anybody in this room
ever won it even once?
Anybody in this room? Hmm?
- No? No?
- Let's go see Quique about that pump.
- Come on.
- Oh, that's odd.
That makes me the only name on that list.
And you know why?
Because I am the only person on the planet
to ever win it two years in a row.
Look, Biz...
I know that we've had
our differences over the years,
and I think I apologized
for the fireworks incident.
- No, you didn't.
- Then well...
We have always respected each other
as captains.
And I'm gonna level with you.
I... I have been a little down
on my luck lately, financially speaking,
- and if you could just waive my entry fee...
- Wade...
But I know
that if you bend the rules for me,
you've gotta bend the rules
for every lawyer with a fishing boat,
but let's get creative here.
What if you team me up
with a local fisherman so I can qualify?
Just, you know,
doesn't have to be anybody even good.
Heck,
it doesn't have to be a fisherman.
Just, you know, just a warm body
that can reel the fish in after I hook it.
That's all.
You know, that's a good story.
Some local wild card
that has a shot at the big time.
Now that is good press. Hmm?
- Good press, huh?
- Yeah.
Oh, I really appreciate this, Biz.
You know, I think this is
gonna be my year. I really do.
"Captain Wade Malloy
comes back to defend his title."
Great.
Respect. Who's that?
Casa Hogar.
What, them? Those kids?
No, I cannot work with those kids.
I can't work with kids.
They're thieves, those kids.
Just open the windows.
Dude, do you even know
how water works?
Papa Omar?
Yeah?
Ah! Yeah, okay.
All right. But listen. Remember, Tweety...
God is always listening,
but he doesn't always answer our prayers
the way that we think he should.
So, he gets...
All right. Here's the deal. You and three
of your least annoying orphans
will be on my boat for the duration
of the competition.
Not him. He's too little.
You'll do everything I say,
and you will say nothing.
And when I catch the winning fish,
we'll split the earnings 80/20.
Eighty, me, 20, you.
Comprende? See you next week.
Look. Hey.
Hey, I... I don't even know
what you're talking about!
It worked!
Everybody, my prayer worked!
I can't believe it.
It's a distraction, Becca.
Yes.
And... And a waste of time.
I don't have three days
to be spending on some fishing boat.
Claro.
And the boys are gonna be disappointed.
Yes, but that's life.
They'll... They'll get over it.
Life is very disappointing. That's exactly
what you should tell the kids.
Are you being sarcastic
right now?
Because that's not helping.
Okay, let's talk straight, then.
We have a month to raise $117,000.
Plus, the repairs.
And suddenly, you have the chance
to make all that money at once.
Omar, all you have to do is catch a fish.
Okay. All I have to do is...
That's loca, Becca.
I don't know
the first thing about fishing.
- But Captain Wade does.
- Captain Wade is washed up.
All right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're right.
The odds of you winning
that tournament are very, very small,
so we'll stay with your plan instead.
You have a plan, right?
It has been called
the Super Bowl of fishing tournaments,
where the best anglers
from all over the world
come with dreams of riches and glory.
And in the wake of Hurricane Odile,
today is proof that the spirit of Cabo
will not be broken.
And after 33 years, the Bisbee dream,
stronger than ever before.
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to day one of Bisbee's
Black & Blue fishing tournament.
And what a year it is shaping up to be.
That's right, Larry.
Part of what makes this year so special
is a host of newcomers
from around the Cabo area.
We got first-timers like Team Casa Hogar,
made up of orphans
from the local boys' home
and led by none other
than legendary two-time Bisbee Champion,
Captain Wade Malloy.
Wow, it's gonna
be an exciting three days.
It's H-O-G-A-R.
Okay, and you said
there are five members on your team?
It's... It's six, actually.
Okay.
Him.
Expensive watch.
He's big. Never catch you.
- Look, I'm just chilling, all right?
- No. Her.
Flimsy purse strap.
One pull, bam, you're gone.
- Man, what do you want from me?
- Join us.
I told you, I'm not living
in some broke-down orphanage.
No, man, for the tournament.
Join Team Casa.
- Me?
- Yeah.
- It'll be fun.
- "Fun"?
- Yeah.
- Oh man.
Man, you're really crazy, güey.
That one's mine, güey. That one's mine.
No, no. That one. That one, yeah.
All aboard the SS Hollywood.
Welcome, ladies.
There's tanning oil by the DJ stand.
Yeah. How are we gonna win
against a boat like that?
Actually, that's a motor yacht.
It's not designed for sports fishing.
Yeah, read a book, stupid.
Besides, we got a two-time
Bisbee champion on our team.
I bet you Captain Wade's got one of those
two-time champion speedboats,
the long-bullet-looking kind,
the ones that fly over the water
like a rocket.
Vroom, vroom, vroom!
Dolphins racing to keep up with us.
But we're going so fast,
we can barely hold on to...
Son of a...
Oh, it has nothing to do with a fuel line.
If I wanted a deckhand
with useless opinions,
I would have hired my ex-wife.
Captain Wade?
Oh, you're here. Good.
Good, good, good, good.
What's your name?
- Omar.
- Omar, okay.
This is Hollywood.
I'm sure Omar told all of you.
My name is Captain Wade Malloy,
and I am the only two-time champion
of Bisbee's Black & Blue Tournament.
And you're about to step on
theKnot Enough.
This is a legendary boat
that carried me to both victories.
So, in essence, you are stepping
onto a piece of sport-fishing history.
- It's a piece of something.
- Hey.
This is Chato.
Chato was with me 11 years ago
when I won my first tournament.
- Hola, amigos.
- He's not very good, but he's cheap.
I'm gonna drown him
at the first opportunity.
What?
I said I'm very grateful
for this opportunity.
Oh, yeah.
All right. Well, just get on board.
Give 'em a life jacket.
Stay out of the way.
- Hey, changed your mind?
- Yeah, man. Whatever. Is this our boat?
- Yeah, it is.
- Okay.
Wait a minute. No. No. No, not him.
Okay, look,
he's sorry for what he did, right?
- Ah, super sorry.
- Don't care. He's not getting on my boat.
Well, he's part of our team,
so you take all of us or none of us.
All right, here we go. Take a seat.
Here we go!
Yeah!
Hey, hey!
Chato, check the fuel line!
Yes, Captain.
Chato!
Putamales!
Almost ready.
So, Moco, where are you from, güey?
El Zacatal.
- Wait. What?
- Aye yai yai.
Why would you bring
some Zacatal punk to our team?
- Oye, where you from, baboso?
- El Chaparral, güey! South Side.
Cut it out!
Sí, tranquilo. You cool, right?
Yeah, I like your hair.
Is he messing with me?
No, seems like a guy
who gives compliments.
Wait.
Are you messing with me?
Hey, what are you doing?
- Don't touch that.
- Hey, chill.
- Chato!
- Yeah?
You keep these kids away from our gear.
- Oye, what's his problem?
- Tranquilo.
He doesn't like anyone
touching Adeline.
It's his lucky lure.
The one he used to win both tournaments.
Okay, the line is set.
But first, I want
to clarify a few things, all right?
First, I want to apologize
if my friendly demeanor
gave any of you the impression
that I like you
or that I'm happy to be here with you.
I don't, and I'm not.
So from now on, do not touch anything.
Two, do not open your mouth
unless I explicitly tell you to do so,
or tomorrow, I am going to revoke
your totally symbolic crew positions
and replace you
with some other nameless orphans.
All right.
Now, once we get a fish on the line,
Bisbee made me agree
that I need to let one of you
do all of the reeling.
Oh, oh, me, me, me.
- So, Omar, you be ready.
- Putamales.
I'm gonna put you in this fighting chair,
and I'm going to instruct you
how to reel it in.
All right?
Any other questions?
- We have names.
- What?
You said we were nameless orphans,
but we have names.
Yeah. And we're not orphans, güey.
We're, like,
between families at the moment.
- Captain Wade?
- Yeah.
- Do you live in here?
- What do you want, Mr. Venegas?
Well, I'd rather not reel in the fish,
if that's okay.
Why not?
Well, I just think it would be
a lot more fun for one of the kids,
you know, and meaningful.
"Fun for the kids."
Yeah. Yeah.
I was thinking that, you know,
maybe Moco could do it.
Yeah, I know you guys had that issue,
but he's older,
and I think it'd make him feel
like he's more part of the team.
Sure. Yeah, whatever.
That's fine. Anything else?
No. No.
Oh good. Great.
Actually, there's... there's one more thing.
What?
I was kind of hoping that you can help me
manage their expectations a little bit.
How's that?
Come on. You know.
I mean, they're excited to be here,
which is great.
Right? But it's no secret
that the odds are against us here, right?
I know you used to be
a great captain once, but...
That's not what I meant.
What I'm trying to say here
is that I just want them
to be realistic about this. That's all.
You're right. You're absolutely right.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- Great.
- Good.
- Perfect. Great.
- Um...
So maybe you could just...
you could just say a few words.
Oh, of course. Yeah.
Just whenever.
Thank you.
Yeah.
All right, team. Everybody, listen up.
Change of plans.
You.
You're gonna reel in the fish.
- Me?
- Why him?
Yeah. That punk ain't even part
of this team.
Maybe you guys could trade off
when we get tired.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Capitán, remember Team Blackjack.
You can't trade off.
First one to touch the rod
has gotta reel in the fish all by himself.
Why? What's Team Blackjack?
It's a winning team.
Didn't follow the rules.
One million dollars...
- Nah.
- Yeah.
So?
Well, you wanna do it or not?
Dale. Whatever.
Oh wow.
That's so inspiring.
All right!
Listen, I know you boys are excited,
but I want you to keep one thing
in mind, all right?
Fishing is a very hit-and-miss thing.
You can make the best of plans.
You can make informed decisions.
But there's a lot of variables
you can't control.
And I've been fishing these waters
for...
...25 years,
and I don't catch a big marlin every day.
Oh, well, Captain Wade,
I think I speak for all of us
when I say that we're just...
But I have never gone three days in a row
without catching something,
and I sure as hell
am not about to start right now.
And I'm telling you boys,
do not get discouraged
because we are going
to catch the winning marlin,
and you boys are in
for the ride of your life.
- Give me five! Give me five! Give me five!
- Putamales, güey. You hear that?
- Down low, too slow.
- Yay!
Get ready.
Putamales, güey.
You hear that?
Yeah!
Hey.
What was that?
Well, if you wanna teach those kids
how to be losers their whole life,
that's your problem.
I don't want any part of it.
I'm a winner. That's the way I roll.
Are you joking me?
Mr. Venegas, I am not a joke.
All good?
Oh yeah. It's good.
You ready, Moco?
Yeah, I guess.
Man, forget this.
Oye, what's his problem, man?
Eh, they shot his brother in your hood
back in the day. No big deal.
Man, I can't believe we might
actually win this thing.
I love fishing, güey.
I hate fishing.
Hey.
Looks like you're the only one
that isn't sick.
- Have you done this before?
- No.
I mean, I don't know. Maybe.
Ah, that's normal.
You know, most people remember things
by looking at pictures,
and their family tells them stories.
But, you know, since you never had that...
No, I have parents.
Oh.
I told you, man. I'm not an orphan.
Mmm.
Well, where are they?
My mom's in Texas.
Maybe Arizona. I don't know.
And your father?
As far as possible, I hope.
- When's the last time you saw him?
- What's with all the questions?
Hey. I mean, I'm just asking.
Just talking, man.
Yeah, well,
talk about the weather or something.
I mean, you wanna talk about
the last time you saw your parents?
That's what I thought.
It was on a boat.
What?
Yeah, I don't remember my mom,
but the last time I saw my father,
we were on a boat, and...
Yeah, it was my eighth birthday.
I mean, neither one of us knew anything
about fishing,
but I begged him to take us, but...
I don't know.
The memory's a little foggy, pero...
He must've hit his head
when the boat flipped over.
Pero, nah, you know...
I'm... I'm lucky.
These boys, they never got a chance
to meet their fathers at all.
Your father's dead, man.
You don't have to act all happy about it.
I'm not happy about it, all right?
I'm just grateful,
you know, that I had a chance
to meet my father.
Somebody to show me the ropes, sabes?
And, hey, that's what I am for these boys.
That's why they call me Papa Omar.
I told you I ain't calling you papa, güey.
A little bit, but it's okay,
Papa Omar.
Wow.
- Captain Wade.
- Yeah?
Hey, come and join us.
We got some extra tacos.
No. I'm okay. Thanks.
No, sí. Come sit with us. Don't be rude.
Mmm.
Okay.
The boys were wondering
about that fish you caught.
What fish?
When you won the tournament.
That must have been crazy, güey.
We wanna hear all about it.
Oh, well, yeah, that fish.
Yeah, that was something.
Wow. You got a real gift for stories,
Dr. Seuss.
Ándale, Capitán. Show them the scar.
Órale! We love scars!
All right. Yeah.
The big marlin,
his bill went right through my calf,
right there.
- Oye!
- Almost took off my leg.
- Yeah, that was a rookie move.
- "Rookie"?
- Whatever. You won two years in a row.
- Could have been luck.
Actually, not true.
The chances of that are about
one in 10,000.
At least from the number of boats
in the tournament.
Well, I ain't scared of no marlin,
and I ain't scared of no scars.
Mira! Mira! Look, look, look.
I got in a fight
with some vatos in my hood.
Oh!
Your uncle hit you
with a coat hanger.
My tía used to do the same thing to me.
Whatever.
You stupid, güey.
I'll show you a real scar.
- A screwdriver.
- Ooh!
Big rusty one. My foster dad stabbed me
for spilling his cerveza.
Oh! That's cold.
Hey, Wiki, show him the scars
on your back, güey.
- Yeah.
- Hollywood, déjalo.
What? We all got 'em.
Hey, Moco.
You for sure got some scars,
am I right, güey?
Let's see 'em.
No, I'm good.
Yeah, he got those Zacatal scars.
Tripping on shoelaces.
Running into glass doors.
Oye, keep talkin', I'll give you
some new scars you can brag about.
Fish on!
Oh yeah! All right.
Come up here. Get in the fighting chair.
Come on. Take the rod.
Ready? Go.
Pull it. Don't let go. Put it in. Good.
Good, good, good. Reel forward.
That's it. Get a rhythm.
- Chato.
- Yeah?
- Chato, you got a visual?
- Yeah!
Blue! Blue-green! Grande!
Blue-green? Is that... Is that good?
It's a blue marlin. That's what we want!
Chato, Chato, call the tower.
Tell 'em we got a fish on!
Gigante!
Oh!
Pull, pull, pull!
Fish on! Aquí! Casa Hogar Team!
Team Casa Hogar!
- That's it. Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.
- Team Casa Hogar! Fish on!
¡Grande!
Keep pulling! Keep pulling!
So, should we take a team photo?
And there's
your first-place fish for day one.
From Team Deep Blue Something,
a 368-pound blue!
Oye, can I drive?
- Get in there.
- Yeah, whatever.
You should come stay with us tonight.
Got plenty of beds.
Yeah. Come on, güey.
What do you say?
I told you. I ain't no helpless orphan.
- Well, you coming back tomorrow?
- I don't know.
Be at the docks at 7:00.
Hey.
Today was pretty cool, right?
I mean, we didn't catch fish, but...
Yeah, I mean, that was fun,
but it isn't gonna save Casa Hogar
unless we win, right?
Hollywood heard Becca talking to the bank.
Hey, you don't have to worry
about that stuff, okay?
Es que, I can't go back to the streets,
Papa Omar.
I mean, the other tipos,
Geco and Hollywood, I mean, they're tough.
They can handle it.
But it's just, I'm different.
Hey, nobody's goin' back on the streets.
All right?
I promise.
Check out this ride, güey.
Look at the lights!
Whose car is this?
It's nice.
Papa Omar!
Look what your brother brought me.
My brother?
I told them
we were like brothers. Ah?
But I am obviously too handsome
to be related to you.
Hector! What are you doing?
- Come here, man!
- Oh!
Look at you, man! You look good!
You haven't changed a bit.
Well, you haven't either. You look great.
You've got all your hair.
And when the TV announcer said
Team Casa Hogar,
I... I said to myself, "Ay, Dios."
Omar Venegas on a fishing boat.
No! He must've been drugged.
He must have been taken at gunpoint.
Chavos, en verdad, dígame. Was he nervous?
- He was super nervous, güey.
- Ah.
A huevo! He was terrified.
Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys.
We have an early morning tomorrow.
- Hey. Un momento.
- So let's get to bed.
I know that Team Casa Hogar may not have
a million-dollar fishing boat,
but that don't mean that
they cannot look like a million bucks!
And for you. Mira!
No way!
Yeah. Okay, okay, boys.
You heard Papa Omar.
It's time to go to bed. Come on.
- Come on, come on.
- Gracias, Hector.
Gracias, Señor Hector.
- Gracias, Señor Hector.
- De nada.
God, güey, this is like silk!
You guys be good, okay?
Oye. Let's get out of here, bro.
You could see the flames
from two streets away.
Okay, mira. I remember the fire,
but are you sure that was us?
Oye. Three vatos staring at a burning car
with the smell of gasoline on them.
It doesn't take a detective.
Hey, mira.
That's how Kacho lost his eyebrows.
Wait, you mean Humpty?
Exacto. Humpty Dumpty.
That's how he got his nickname.
- Humpty Dumpty. Remember?
- Oh.
With his... With his burnt eyebrows.
Gracias.
His shaved head and his light skin?
He looked like a big egg, bro.
- Man. Right, that was us.
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow. That was bad.
- Mmm.
- Do you think they still call him Humpty?
- Kacho? Nah, he's dead.
But you're doing really good. Huh?
Becca. Wow.
I never thought
that you would settle down.
Yeah, well, people change.
Oh, sí, sí, you're a new man now.
Papa Omar.
Yeah, what are you doing here, Hector?
I mean, you see us on the news
and then you decide to come
and visit us after ten years?
Eh, oye, tranquilo.
I'm just checking in on an old friend
to see if there's anything
that you need from Papa Hector.
Yeah. No, I'm good. We're good.
A huevo. That's a big relief.
'Cause I heard
that you owe the bank 117 grand.
But they must have you confused
with some other Papa Omar.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
Okay, okay. With a fishing tournament?
A poco? Perdón.
I don't mean to laugh, okay?
Pero, wow.
I hope you got something better than that.
I mean, the boys that I met tonight,
they're soft now, Omar.
You remember
what it's like on the streets.
You send them back out there,
they're gonna get eaten alive.
You wanna work again?
- I can give you a few easy runs a month.
- Forget it.
Come on, you could pay off the loan.
You could fix up the place.
- A new soccer field for the chamaquitos...
- I said forget it.
I'm not like that anymore.
- Like what?
- Like you.
I'm sorry, güey. I...
It's okay, Omar, you know.
At least I'm honest about who I am.
What does that mean?
It's easy to be the patron saint
of orphans
when everything is going good, huh?
Well, you let me tell you something.
Sooner or later,
you're gonna run into a problem
that you can't solve
with hopes and prayers,
and then we'll see what
the real Papa Omar is made of.
Lina!
Another beautiful morning here
in Cabo San Lucas
as we begin day two of Bisbee's
Black & Blue fishing tournament.
Now, Team Deep Blue Something
is the team to beat today
with a 368-pound beauty
they reeled in yesterday.
He ain't comin'.
You're late.
- Brought you a jersey.
- Qué menso. I'm not wearing that thing.
How much longer does it take, güey?
This is not boring.
This is great!
You'd rather be back at the orphanage?
How does this boat smell like fish
when there's absolutely no fish?
This cabin is a no orphan zone.
Yeah. Dale. Sorry.
Hey, um, is that a Bristol knot?
Yes, it is.
Yeah, I just read about it.
It looks really complicated.
Well, it's complicated to read about,
yeah, but not to do.
- Oh.
- Come here, come here, come here. Look.
I got my line. I got my loop.
I wrap my line around the loop six times,
take one end of the line,
put it back through the loop,
and then I'm gonna
pull both sides of the line...
And then the tension
holds the knot in place.
Correcto.
Awesome. Thanks.
Congratulations, muchachos,
on your new uniforms.
You look like you should be
selling cell phone plans at a strip mall.
Hey, Wiki, you're up for reeling today.
Hey, that's a great idea.
Hey, Wiki? En serio?
My abuelita is stronger than him.
No manches, güey.
You ain't got no abuela.
It's a finger of speech, idiota.
Cállate.
Wiki, what do you think?
I don't know.
Geco's probably better suited.
Okay, Captain Wade, what do you think?
Reeling in marlin is hard.
But I've talked younger kids than you
through the whole thing.
Everything was just fine.
- You'll be all right.
- You mean your son?
Yeah.
I saw the photo in the cabin.
Wait, you have a son?
- Yeah.
- Where? How old is he?
Uh, he's about your age.
Uh, lives with his mother in Dallas.
- He...
- Why aren't you with him?
Uh, well, uh, I'm a marlin fisherman.
- What does that mean?
- There's no marlin fishing in Dallas.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got that part, güey.
But for real. Is that what you're saying?
You picked fishing over your own son?
- Well, that's not the way I'd put it.
- Then how would you put it?
- Geco.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look...
I believe every man has got inside him
this call to greatness,
to be able to do something better
than anybody else.
And, uh, most men, they're afraid of that.
And they make any excuse they can,
including their family,
to play it safe,
not to answer that call.
But I'm not that way.
I'm out here, and I'm doing it.
And my son,
maybe one of these days,
he's gonna be able to hold up my trophies,
and he's gonna be able to say,
"Hey, my dad was special."
"My dad was somebody."
And then maybe he'll have the guts
to pass that gift on to his own son.
A fishing trophy?
Oye. We all lost our dads
for stupid reasons.
Bullets, drugs, prison.
But right now, I'm feeling kind of lucky
compared to your son.
- Set the line, would you?
- Yes, sir.
Uno, dos, tres.
Uno, dos, tres.
- Uh, Chato.
- Qué pasó, mijo?
Fish on! Captain, fish on!
No way! No way!
Wiki, get in the chair.
Good, good, good. All right. You got it.
Is it seaweed?
Next, I want you to set the drag.
Very slow.
Hey. You got a visual on it?
- Yeah!
- Good. Good.
All right. I want you to reel! Reel!
That's it.
Few clicks at a time. That's it.
Back. Okay, reel, reel, reel, reel.
Oh! Oh!
Did you see that?
Oh!
Hang on! Hang on, Wiki! Good!
Oye, Moco. Don't feel bad, güey.
Catching seaweed is still a big
accomplishment where you're from.
I guess we all can't be as successful
as your brother, güey.
What did you say?
You heard me, orphan boy!
Keep coming back! Keep coming back!
Help!
Geco! Hold on! Omar!
Reel forward! Reel, reel, reel, reel!
Come on, Wiki! Pull, pull, pull!
- You're doing this. Reel, reel, reel!
- Omar!
Hey! I got you!
Get a rhythm. Come on, come on.
Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.
Geco!
Okay. You're doing good.
You're doing great.
- Hold on, boys!
- Captain!
Captain!
Jump in!
No, I don't know how to swim!
Chato, jump in!
I can't swim!
Goddamn it!
Captain Wade!
Captain Wade!
God!
Hey.
Just lost my shoe, güey!
Your shoe?
Do you have any idea
what I just lost, you little punk?
Hey! They're just kids, man!
I don't care!
This is why I didn't want kids
in the first place!
I said no kids!
It's the end of day two
and a couple of new additions
to the leaderboard,
but still no challenger
to the 368-pound marlin
brought in by Team Deep Blue Something
yesterday afternoon.
That's right.
With just one day left of competition,
the other teams are starting
to feel the pressure.
But when you got
the world's greatest fishermen
all in one spot,
well, it ain't over until it's over.
Mañana?
Maybe not.
Moco!
Are you gonna walk home with one shoe?
Sure you don't wanna stay for dinner
before I take you back?
Probably got an extra pair of shoes too.
Uh... Nah, man. I'm... I'm good.
Ándale. Don't be rude. Come inside.
I got some shoes you can borrow.
Dale.
All right. All right. Ready?
Okay. One, two, three.
Who can jump? Ooh! Ooh!
- Looks like you caught a big one today.
- Yeah.
Mr. Bisbee called.
Told me to tell you no luck with the bank.
Okay.
And someone came by
and took pictures of the whole property.
I'm not gonna lie, Omar.
The possibility of losing this place
in two weeks is starting to feel real now.
Papa Omar.
Oh, wow, mijo! This is awesome.
It's Captain Wade.
Yeah, I see that.
Did I spell it right? Becca helped.
Yeah, you did.
Can you nail it above my door tonight?
Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Okay, boys. Time to bed.
Group one, you have five minutes
to get your teeth brushed
with toothpaste, okay?
- What?
- Captain Wade.
It's me, Omar.
What do you want?
Brought you some dinner.
Come in.
Take a seat.
This is a torta ahogada.
It's an old hangover remedy...
Whoever said that "a bad day of fishing
was better than a good day at home"
didn't have a day like today.
Hey, look, sorry about the lure.
I... I know that it meant...
Adeline. That's what you called it, right?
Yeah. Adeline, that was my wife's name.
It was my son's idea.
The last time you saw 'em?
October 28, 2009.
They were on their way to Dallas.
Do you ever think about going after 'em?
Well, there was a day left
in the tournament.
Yeah.
You think I'm a terrible father,
don't you?
- No.
- Yeah, you do.
No. No, no. Look.
I think that we're all just trying
to do the best that we can, you know?
But look, I'm gonna be honest with you,
I think Geco's right.
You know, like, kids, they don't need
a father with fishing trophies.
They need a father
that's gonna be with them every day.
No matter what. Like an anchor.
"Anchor." That's really clever.
Mmm.
Yeah, well, my son...
...he wanted to be just like me.
First time I brought home
that Black & Blue trophy,
he just thought I walked on water.
And she was like butter in my hands.
Just easy.
She used to call me,
"Oh, Captain. My Captain."
And then I lost.
I lost again, lost again.
And then I lost everything.
So, this was my shot.
You know?
Chance to be a champion again.
I thought if I could pull it off,
I'd be Mr. Wonderful.
Maybe they'd come back. Who knows?
That doesn't sound crazy.
But if we're gonna have a shot,
you gotta get something in your stomach.
Oh.
We don't have another shot.
Lightning doesn't strike twice.
- Come on. You don't know that.
- Yeah. Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
Look, I was skeptical
about this whole thing,
but then I see that marlin on the line,
and I...
I don't know. Just, crazy things happen
all the time, right?
Look, we never dreamed
of being in the Bisbee.
- The bank's got us by the throat, and...
- What bank? What bank?
- Nothing.
- Wait...
- No. Look, I'm not trying to pressure you.
- Oh no. You're not.
What?
Are you... Are you using this tournament
to save your orphanage?
- That's exactly what's going on here.
- Look, I'm just... Look...
Oh, don't you put that guilt on me.
Okay, look,
I... I know that tomorrow's a long shot.
This is so screwed up.
All I'm trying to say is
that we still have a chance.
We never had a chance.
You might be right,
but we still have to try.
It's over.
Yeah. Yeah.
One of the younger boys made this for you.
Hello?
What's going on?
A local fisherman
caught this this morning.
He's not in the tournament.
He's gonna sell it to us
for a pretty good price.
What? Sell it to us? For what?
Well, this is a 270-pound blue marlin.
It's... It's not first place,
but it's third place, maybe second.
That's really good money.
Wait, you... you wanna cheat? Why?
Well, you wanna win
this tournament, don't you?
This is how we do it.
There's no other way.
So look...
...when you get to the dock
with the boys,
this fish is gonna be
all wrapped up already,
and it's gonna be tied under the boat
at the back just under the water, okay?
Nobody's gonna see it
unless they're looking for it.
And then, when we get out to sea,
you're gonna help me
put this fish on our lines
so that one of the boys can reel it in.
Wait. Me? But...
Does Chato know about this?
Chato... Chato doesn't really approve,
but he knows it's for a good cause.
He's gonna help us distract the boys.
Oh. Okay. Look, man. I...
What are you doing?
I didn't mean to tell you about the bank.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pressure you.
But... But this isn't the only way. I mean,
dude, you won this thing twice in a row.
- Okay? No. If anybody can do it, you can...
- Omar. Omar, I cheated.
I cheated.
What?
The second time that I won,
this is what I did.
You won it once before, right?
- That means something, right?
- Yes.
Some days it does.
Most days...
I don't know. I don't know.
Look, I can't do this without you.
So if you wanna back out,
you gotta give me the word right now.
But if you wanna save those boys,
this is what you gotta do.
Get some rest.
Mijo, I already told you.
This isn't for little kids.
It's okay. God told me to come.
Oh yeah? How'd he do that?
Didn't he tell you too?
All right. Come on.
Just get in the front seat.
Didn't know you were listening to God
all of a sudden.
It's the third and final day of
Bisbee's Black & Blue fishing tournament.
368 pounds is still the number to beat,
and with just nine hours left to go
in this competition,
the rest of the teams
are feeling a new sense of urgency.
Hey.
Uh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- This kid's too little.
- Captain Wade, this is Tweety.
He drew that picture
I gave you last night,
and he's very excited to be here.
I know why my mom left me now.
Oh God. Here we go.
So I could help you win this tournament.
Of course she did. Yeah.
Just get him a life jacket.
And let's get out of here.
Come on.
On the boat.
Here we go!
Chato. Fuel line. Check the fuel line.
- Chato.
- Que? Capitán!
Y'all need a hand?
We're okay.
No. We're... We're good!
- You sure? I can take a look.
- Yeah.
- Yeah! We're good!
- Great.
Okay. You got it. Happy fishing.
All right. Thanks.
Adios!
Hey, muchachos, vengan.
I got something for you. Come on!
For us?
Yes.
- Hey, Omar. Uh...
- Yeah.
Help me out with the fuel line,
will you, here?
Yeah.
Miren.
Is that Don Miguel's restaurant?
That's right.
Tenemos tortas, quesadillas, elotes.
All you can eat.
Tweety. You like it?
Okay.
I'm gonna reel in the lure.
We can hook the fish.
What did you do?
You stupid, dumb...
Hey, guys.
Listen up. I, uh, I just wanted
to say that, uh...
Thank you, Captain Wade and Chato
for bringing us out here.
Gave us an opportunity
that we never expected
and an experience that we'll never forget.
The reality is that
we didn't catch the fish that we needed,
and all of you know what that means.
Now, I've always said
if you straighten yourselves out
and you... you do the right thing
every chance that you get,
that things will work out in the end.
But that isn't exactly true.
Sometimes things don't work out.
Oftentimes, actually.
You take the hard paths,
you make all the right sacrifices,
and then at the end of the day,
you find that you're just standing
in the same place,
and it'll all feel like
it was all for nothing.
But it isn't.
Because when life knocks you down,
which it often does,
you'll be able to face it with character.
Now, I'll always love you.
And no matter what happens,
you'll always be my sons.
And I will always be your papa.
So you lied.
You promised us you would never
let us go back on the street.
Yeah, but didn't you hear him?
We got character now,
so it's gonna be great.
Geco...
Don't worry, Papa Omar.
I know what you're saying. I get it.
Good things do happen.
Just not to us.
So, we're not gonna catch a fish?
Well, look, hey, Chato.
Why don't you go set up some rods
at the front
and show these kids
how to catch some mackerel. All right?
No, no, no, no, no.
Timing, you know?
Fish on! Fish on!
Wait. No.
- Here. No, no, I can't. I can't. I can't.
- Don't hand that thing to me.
- Please. I can't.
- No, no, no, no, no. Hey, turn around.
That's the gimbal. There you go.
All right, I'm gonna talk you
through this. You got a visual?
Yeah! Blue! Blue!
It's a marlin!
We got a marlin on the line!
All right. I want you to set the drag.
Nice and easy,
'cause you don't wanna snap it.
- Good, good, good.
- Okay.
All right, breathe. Breathe.
Now I want you to reel forward.
Come on. Reel. Come on. It's all you.
Reel forward, pull back.
Okay, you've got him.
- Call him. Chato, call him in.
- Yes, sir!
Reel forward.
Pull back.
- Bisbee? Bisbee?
- Forward.
And that's why we always say
the Black & Blue is way more
than just a fishing tournament.
- It's a way...
- Wayne! Wayne!
Casa Hogar hooked a blue. It's a big one!
You... You, come with us.
And another potential billfish
on the line,
this time from local team Casa Hogar,
the team comprised of orphans
from around the Cabo area.
Definitely unexpected.
Get us a radio in the office, please.
Reel, reel, reel, reel, reel!
Okay.
Pull, pull, pull, pull.
- Chato, move the boat back.
- Yeah!
Just a few cranks. Give him some water.
Chato! Our location is 20 degrees north.
Twenty degrees north,
one-four-nine degrees west!
Fish on!
Well, if they manage
to pull this off,
Team Casa Hogar will be
the first-ever Mexican team
to win the Bisbee's Black & Blue.
It's on. You're gonna lose him. Oh, easy!
It's been 40 minutes since Team Casa Hogar
first called in the initial hook,
so they've gotta be close.
Pull, pull, pull.
That's it. That's it. That's it.
Okay.
Forward. Reel, reel, reel, reel.
Pull, pull.
Come on. You can do it.
Pull!
Pull!
- God! Don't do that! Don't give up on me.
- I can't.
- Omar, listen to me.
- Yeah.
You look at these boys.
Look at these boys. They're your boys.
They need you. They need you to fight.
Fight for them.
- Fight!
- You can do it, Papa Omar!
- Sí, you got this.
- Hey...

You got this.
Good job!

Yeah, that's it!
Almost there! I can see it!
Papa!
One more time! Pull!
We did it! We did it!
Yeah!
We did it!
They did it! Yes! Yes!
And in the final hour,
an absolutely stunning turn of events.
Team Casa Hogar catches an unbelievable
384-pound blue marlin
that puts them
at the top of the leaderboard.
It is my great honor
and pleasure to announce
the 2014 Bisbee's
Black & Blue tournament champion.
Team Casa Hogar!
Whoo!
And I want a jet ski and a white tiger...
That's stupid, güey.
Okay. A regular tiger.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You're ever in Dallas,
you gotta look me up. All right?
There's no marlin in Dallas.
I already got my marlin.
Think I'm gonna be an anchor for a while.
There's no doubt about it now.
You really are a two-time Bisbee champion.
Hey. Team Casa?
Team Casa.
Team Casa.
Team Casa!
Team Casa!
