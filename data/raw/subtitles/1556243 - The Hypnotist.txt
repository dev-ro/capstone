Jump! Come on, red team.
One more time!
And slam the ball in the basket!
Yes! Good work!
We received a call about a possible
homicide in Ekbacken's gymnasium.
34-2610 and 34-9220 you are on roadblocks
and witness testimonies. Over.
9220 here. Copy that.
Joona Linna, National Police.
Where can I step?
If you stay along
the blue line you should be fine.
- Do we know who he is?
- Yes. His name is Anders Ek.
47 years. He was a gym teacher here.
We have multiple wounds
from a sharp weapon.
A knife or something similar.
Joona, they called me.
This is not a case for us. Go home.
Has his family been notified?
Yes, by the police.
Now go home and get some rest.
I'm on my way.
Alright, keep us updated.
Over and out.
9022 here.
We are at the murder victim's house.
We need paramedics and reinforcements at
Inskärsvägen 5. Tell them to hurry.
Understood. Paramedics should be there
in about 5 - 10 minutes. Over.
- Did you call 911?
- Yes.
Joona Linna, National Police.
I was nearby. Was it here?
Are you okay?
What is it that's happened?
I saw that something wasn't right.
It's sick.
Paramedics are on their way.
I'll go out and meet them.
What the hell...?!
Patient has been stabbed, is unconscious,
low respiratory rate, blood pressure: 60
High pulse, no heartbeat on the left side.
- Who are you?
- Joona Linna from the police.
Wait here.
Ok, I'm ready with the intubation.
Connect a ringer's solution.
Take a BAS-test and
determine the blood type.
Hi, Josef. I need to check your eyes.
It's not dangerous.
- We will continue the treatment.
- Definitely.
- You have to wait.
- How is his condition?
Serious. There's a
chance he won't make it.
I have to talk to him.
- He can't talk.
- Please, let me try?
His entire family has been killed.
Mother, father, sister.
Impossible.
The boy can't talk at the moment.
You can buy some snacks while you wait.
I have a patient waiting.
Hello, Magdalene.
Sorry I'm calling
you so late, but it's an emergency.
Yes, there is a witness.
A boy, but he can't be questioned.
I don't even know if he'll survive.
We could end up with purely
technical evidence and no witnesses.
Find out what you can
and come over here. Okay?
- Maybe there's a way.
- Hold on. I have to go. Yes?
Maybe there's a way.
Erik?
Erik. Your phone.
Erik!
- I can talk to him if you want.
- Okay.
- Pick it up.
- Erik Maria Bark.
This is Assistant Commissioner
Inspector Joona Linna.
I'm you calling from Danderyd hospital.
- What has happened?
- A badly injured patient.
- Who is the doctor on duty?
- Daniella Richards.
Why... why would she call?
Just a moment. We will do it like this.
- I'll be there.
- Okay. Thank you.
Remember to tell her.
- Who was it?
- A policeman.
- Policeman?
- The Assistant Commissioner.
What happened?
A boy, they want me to look at.
A wounded boy.
I'm heading there now. Damn!
I'm coming afterward.
Erik?
You forgot your phone.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Now go back to bed.
- Sorry, honey.
- What the hell are you doing?
Yeah, what the hell are we doing?
- Come find me if you need anything.
- And the pain relief is the same?
In 3213
Thanks for being here.
This is Joona Linna from the police.
- Great that you could make it. Coffee?
- No thanks.
- Was it you who called?
- Yes. So you're a specialist in
acute trauma.
Erik is the best in the area.
You had a patient I needed to look at.
Follow me.
It's okay. He's also a doctor.
Sorry.
- What's his name?
- Josef
Josef? My name is Erik.
If you feel my hand, then press it.
My judgment is the same as
Daniella's. There's no contact.
You said there were other methods.
What other methods, Joona?
What other methods?
Hypnosis.
He asked if there was any method.
- You know that I'm now allowed, right?
- Yes.
Erik?
Erik! Erik, wait!
- Hello, Magdalene.
- Hi.
They were in the register.
The father was a compulsive gambler.
I'll pass it on to Stockholm PD.
They can take a closer look
at his father's entourage.
Who is leading the
preliminary investigation?
No idea.
I don't think this is an internal showdown.
They wanted to kill an entire family,
and our only witness cannot communicate.
- There's an older daughter, as well.
- What?
The social services were involved when she
was a teenager. She went into foster care.
- Has she gotten police protection?
- I don't think so.
I don't even have an address for her.
Wait, Erik! Wait!
Erik? Erik!
There is a sister.
The family had a daughter as well.
Someone is out to get her,
and the boy probably knows who it is.
- I can't help you.
- Yes.
I know that you can get in touch with him.
- You can't.
- Of course, you can.
It doesn't work as you think.
You only get to his truth,
his own, subjective memories.
There's a risk that I could affect him.
He has a heck of an ability
to get people to remember.
A little too good,
according to some people.
Can you feel my hand?
You can hear me.
There is absolutely nothing
to be afraid of.
We can stop whenever you want.
You are lying on a rock.
It is very warm.
You are looking at the clouds.
I'm sitting in front of you.
I'm with you all the time.
We jump into the water.
We dive down.
Now I will count down from five...
- and for each number we sink deeper.
And feel a greater and greater peace.
Five
...four
three
...two
one.
Now we are at your house.
What happens?
Sofa,
sofa.
I sit on the couch.
What happens on the couch?
I'm reading the letter.
What letter is this?
A letter for me.
Are you alone?
Lisa's sitting next to me.
There's a knock on the door.
What do you do?
Josef. Josef, listen to me.
Everything is alright.
I count to five, and on five you will wake.
One, two, three...
-four, five.
Easy now.
We have to continue.
The boy has to be constantly monitored.
- It has been arranged.
- And the sis... Sorry.
- Hello?
- We need to find the sister.
Did you take any sleeping pills?
No.
I promised not to.
I know where you're hiding them.
You have taken four.
I'm sorry.
Why do you keep on taking them?
- To be able to sleep.
- Sleep from what?
Say what you want, but I think
it's all about gambling debts.
Nah. I think it's a serial killer.
Of course you think that,
then you could handle the case.
I was there, Carlos.
I saw both crime scenes, right?
Someone wanted to kill the entire family.
It was planned, organized...
- and almost completed.
The man in the gym was
the first to be killed.
First that guy, then on to the townhouse,
where he continues with the family.
He almost succeeded. And someone is,
trying to eradicate that family...
- so if he finds the daughter. Maybe
it already has happened. Or the boy.
It's an urgent matter.
I know it's Christmas time
but we must take care of this.
Stockholm PD wants to take
care of it themselves.
They can continue on the gambling debt angle,
but let me examine the other one.
The man was killed first.
The needle will give
agreement with me when the autopsy is complete.
Well, okay then.
Okay.
Until we have the order of the
killings resolved.
You may do as you want.
I'll get on it then.
Could I use Magdalena?
Well that comes as a surprise.
- Okay, but only her.
- Fine.
I'll take Benjamin to school.
What's wrong with the bus?
I'll take him.
I'm going that way anyway. Why?
Good.
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.
Benjamin! You coming?
Why are you and Mom arguing so much?
- Do you really think we do?
- Yes.
We have to stop it then.
It's not good.
- You're still single, eh?
- Yeah, why?
Whenever I call, you can show up,
at any time of day.
- Every day, always.
- But only when you call.
You were right.
The guy from the gymnasium died first.
- Will you be sending the report...?
- Yeah, I have talked to Carlos.
- I should say hi. The case is yours.
- Thank you.
Now, watch this. To press such a broad
blade through bone and muscle...
- is difficult, even for a strong person,
but these stab wounds are not deep.
So?
Someone had to put in a lot
of effort to do it.
What was the name of
the officer who called?
What?
- The policeman who called last night.
- I can't remember.
What was his name?
I don't know. Why?
- I can't believe you bother.
- What?
- That you bother to go on.
- What now?
A policeman rang, I drove to
the hospital, there was a wounded boy.
Okay.
The display said Daniella.
You do know that right?
- Do you think it was Daniella?
- It said so on the display.
- He called from her phone.
- Okay. Good.
Call her. Here you. Okay, he called
from her phone. Talk to her.
- No.
- Ask yourself.
I don't want to talk to him.
Stop it. It doesn't matter.
- It means a lot.
- I believe in you.
There's nothing with Daniella. That was
two years ago. Let it go, move on.
She works at the hospital,
and I was there.
Okay. Okay.
This sister can not have just
disappeared. Or what?
Magdalena? Evelyn must have a telephone,
that can be traced, a workplace...
- or a place to study.
Friends who know her.
Where is the last place she was seen?
There's no trace. Not yet.
It's as if she doesn't want to be found.
Okay.
During the night there's a knock on the
door, and Josef goes out to open it.
That is our assumption.
Forget that it was
said under hypnosis.
We are not in court.
A person stabs the
whole family and walks away.
- And we have found no DNA trace.
- Our forensics examined the blood.
Sister, mother and Josef at home and
the father at the basketball hall.
No other DNA trace,
no fingerprints, nothing.
Wait, Josef said he had read a letter.
- Had anything like that been found?
- I don't think so.
You can go home for today.
I need to do something.
Go see if your children
still remember you.
- Police!
- Police! Lay down your weapon!
- Get on the ground!
I'm gonna lie down
- I'm a colleague
- Look to your left!
I'm a cop. My ID is
in my left pocket. Relax.
Joona Linna. National Police?
What the hell are you doing here?
What's that?
Who packed it all?
This is one big mess.
- We had such pretty...
- What?
I don't know where they have gone.
Your packaging is so sloppy.
- My packaging is sloppy?
- Yes.
- It was me who packed it all?
- Yes. It was indeed.
- Shut up.
- Well it was.
Let it go. I already gave you an apology.
I'm sorry.
From when I discovered it?
It was two years ago.
You just can't let it go.
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Of course it does.
Oh, so it has nothing to do with it?
You would not understand.
Every time your phone rings, every time
you get mail or a letter, I get scared.
I've really tried.
Every day I try.
Every day I try,
but I can't get confidence.
I don't trust you.
- You know the neighbors called.
- I had done exactly the same.
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. Goodbye.
- Hello?
- Magdalene? I found the letter.
What letter?
The letter, Josef talked about.
Listen to this.
"You are of my flesh and blood,
but the family must die."
"Only when that happens, can
everything be, as it should be."
- What? I can't hear.
- Were you afraid of Santa Claus?
- Joona, it has to wait until tomorrow.
- Okay, we'll wait.
Okay. See you later. Bye.
- May I come in?
- What will happen if I say no?
It does a lot. For me.
- Is it good?
- It's funny.
- It doesn't look funny.
- But it is.
You don't look too happy,
when you're playing.
I love you.
I do. You have to say it.
Whatever it is you can tell me.
If something is hard,
or are you worried about something.
- Anything.
- Please, stop.
Benjamin.
Do you want me to use the
syringe on you tonight?
No, I want Dad to do it.
Okay. Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
Hi.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
There's something I have to tell you.
I can't take any more accusations.
- I can't take it any more.
- They are not accusations.
So.
What is it then?
I need a break.
A break?
I need to take a break from...
- From what? Are you going to cry?
- No.
- What do you need to take a break from?
- From us! You and me.
- A break?
- Yes.
From us, you and me.
For a while.
- What do you mean by a break?
- Not now.
- What do you mean?
- Tomorrow.
- How many did you take?
- Yes. No.
Go sleep on the couch.
I can't handle seeing you like that.
I will not look at you like that.
Go and sleep on the couch.
- Erik?
- Yeah, yeah.
Erik?
Erik?
Erik?
Erik.
Erik!
Dad!
Hello? Hello?
Erik, there's someone in the house...
"Dear child,
I have looked at you for some time...
- and hate what you've become."
"Dear child," could suggest that it is
from someone who is older. Right?
- It goes without saying.
- "I have looked at you for some time."
Yes, as if someone has been
stalking the child.
Something tells me
that this was not the first contact.
Also, they don't know each other.
And doesn't include himself in the family.
And "can everything be as it should be."
What could that mean?
- Psychopath
- Moomintroll
- I'm getting tired of you!
- What a bunch of nonsense.
Would you relax.
Peter, have you got a minute? Follow me.
- Here comes Daddy.
- Has the letter been examined?
- Yes.
- No fingerprints, except for Josef's.
What bothers me is that we have...
We have two executions at two different
locations with a connection.
There are no fingerprints, no DNA.
It seems incredibly professional.
- But needle says that it is an
- amateur.
So we are back at square one.
We have to check out the crime scene again,
check the letter once more...
- contact their relatives
and try to find that sister.
Simone?
Simone? Simone! Simone!
An ambulance to Barnängsgatan 34.
My wife has fainted.
- Well.
- What's happening?
This is embarrassing, Joona.
My goodness. Absolutely incredible.
"Scandal Doctor Helps Police."
- We need to interview that boy and fast.
- It won't hold up in court.
- It might give us the lead we need.
- Has it done that so far?
- The newspaper "Expressen" called me.
- What did you tell them?
I asked them to go to hell.
If you are successful
you will be the man of the day...
- but if you fail, then
Janne Josefsson will knock on your door.
- They found the sister.
- Great. See you.
What do you mean by "still not"
What do you mean,
he has not been to school?
Has he not been to...?
- My love, My love, hi.
- Hi.
You're in the hospital.
Don't worry. You're in the hospital.
It'll all be good.
Take it easy, take it easy.
Hello. Simone?
Erik, Erik, where...?
Benjamin is with you, right?
- Benjamin is not at school.
- Simone? Simone?
Where is Benjamin?
- Stay there.
- I have to go.
- It's not me
- Lie down. I'll take care of it.
We can't talk about it now.
They gave me an injection
and took Benjamin!
They have taken our little boy!
- Simone!
- I have to help Benjamin!
Where? When? Wait, wait.
While we were sleeping!
We have to help our...
Benjamin! Benjamin!
- Benjamin!
- I'll check upstairs.
Benjamin!
No, no, no, no! No! No!
No, not Benjamin.
He's not here.
Give me a second to think.
Simone.
You have to remember.
What happened that night?
I put you in room 333.
It's not a suite, but it is safe.
Hello. National Police.
Is this where Evelyn Ek...?
If you need something
just knock on the door
and we will open it for you.
Okay?
Evelyn?
Hello. My name is Joona.
I'm from the National Police.
I'd like to talk to you.
Do you have any idea
who might have done this?
Someone who has threatened your family
or something like that?
No matter what it is you can tell me.
No one can reach you.
You know nothing. You don't know anything.
You can not protect me.
He will find me.
Who? Who will find you?
Evelyn, who?
- I want to go back now.
- Evelyn. Who?
He suffers from haemophilia.
Haemophiliac Disease.
- Okay.
- So he has injections regularly.
And what happens
if he doesn't get his injections?
Well, since he suffers from haemophilia...
- he risks getting haemorrhages,
which of course can...
Simone, you say you don't
remember anything,
but you know that someone took Benjamin?
- Yes.
- We can't make sense of it.
When I had fallen asleep, someone came
in and gave me a sedative.
- We believe so.
- I know that.
I tried to wake Erik. I heard
Benjamin trying to call me...
- but I was so far out that I...
I need to interrupt here.
You say that you tried to wake Erik?
Okay. Do you sleep heavily, Erik?
Yes. I have trouble sleeping.
So I'm taking...
He's on some very strong sleeping pills.
It was impossible to wake him.
What's the last thing you remember
before closing your eyes?
That Benjamin tried to call me.
It's as if...
It's so hard to explain.
It's like, it's right there in my head.
What did Benjamin's call for help sound like?
He was scared.
You heard fear in his voice,
and that's why you reacted?
Yes. That's why. I wanted to...
It's so hard to sit and talk about it.
Couldn't we...?
Someone took Benjamin.
What do we need to know?
We have to search for him, right?
We need to go look and
not sit here talking.
It is not nonsense.
We are just sitting here talking.
It's
so weird for us because he is our child.
The phone is ringing.
- Bark.
- Hello, Erik. It's Shulman.
Do you know where Simone is?
She had to be here with some paintings.
- Hello?
- Couldn't you stop by the gallery?
- Where are you?
- At home.
Was this about Benjamin?
- Nothing that...?
- No, it was from a gallery.
- My wife is a painter.
- Okay.
Benjamin is gone.
It's such a nightmare.
The police are here.
They want to talk to us, and...
What did you say?
Did you say something?
What has happened?
Hello?
Simone!
Hello?
NO MORE HYPNOSIS
- What happened here?
- National Police? What do you think?
I need to talk with Erik.
What has happened?
A boy has been kidnapped.
From here?
Here. We have to eat something.
And you want to order takeaway?
Are you crazy?
- Just look at the menu.
- Are you crazy?
Are you okay? Are you all right, Erik?
Good. I don't believe
that the murder of the
Eks family has anything to do with this.
- It says on the wall.
- That you shouldn't hypnotize.
It could be anyone. Someone who
doesn't want you to start again.
Who could that be?
- No old enemies? Think about it.
- I don't know.
Okay.
Let us assume that it is as you think,
that it has a direct connection
to the murder of the Ek family.
Then there's only one person,
who can give us the information we need.
And for that we need your help.
Could you...?
Wait. What could I do?
What is it that I can do?
Talk to Josef.
Do you want me to use hypnosis on Josef?
Do you want me to solve your murder?
It's our only option. We are
stuck in this investigation.
If I see that boy again
then the killer will know about it, and...
- He won't find out.
- But it's in the newspaper!
Journalists are calling me up
in the middle of the night!
It was a mistake.
It will not happen again.
- It's your fault! It's your fault.
- Let's stop for today.
- Okay. I'll contact you.
- Goodbye.
Why don't you do something? Huh?
- Why don't you do something?
- Right now we are waiting for demands.
Their demands are on the wall
in my studio. Can't you read?
- We are doing everything we can.
- Okay. Very well.
So we are in good hands. Good.
- Do you want some coffee?
- A cup of tea would be nice?
What the hell...?
Are you going to sit here drinking tea?
Erik, dammit.
They're a couple of idiots.
Are you're going to sit here drinking tea?!
And read the paper?!
I wonder how he is doing
without his medication?
He is strong.
Is he in pain?
He'll be fine. You know that.
Yeah.
We must do something.
We can't just sit here.
The police are doing what they can.
They're helping us.
No one does anything. We are sitting here
doing nothing. Nobody does anything.
They're working on it. They are.
The police ask a lot of questions.
They might as well tell us straight up.
- What?
- They think that we did it.
- Do you have children?
- No.
Then you can't understand
what it feels like.
- You asked if I had an enemy.
- Yeah.
There is one.
Hi. We are looking for Evert Braun.
- Do you know where we can find him?
- He's in the overhead crane.
Let me do this. Wait here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Are you Evert Braun?
- Am I Evert Braun? Yes.
My name is Joona Linna
and I'm from the National Police.
- Would you mind answering a few questions.
- The National Police? But of course.
- Where were you the night before yesterday?
- At work here as always. Why?
- All night?
- Yeah.
Shift working?
Can anyone confirm any of this?
- Ask anyone in the workshop.
- Did you take my son?
- Benjamin. Have you taken...?
- Erik, let me handle this!
What the hell is he doing here?
Have I taken your son from you?
How dare you show up here?!
You have ruined my life you stupid pig!
God damn it, fucking idiot.
Do you realize what a rumor
could do? Try imagining that?
Well, you can't.
Then you show up here
claiming that I have taken your son!
I'm sorry. Sorry.
Okay. That's all.
I was leading a research project.
One of the subjects was Evert Braun.
He talked about abusing children.
- Sexual assaults.
- Well, damn.
I reported him to the police,
which initiated a preliminary research...
- and they closed it on the grounds
that I had planted the evidence.
That I had given them the pictures that
weren't theirs to get from memories.
That I had asked
leading questions. I...
So I was removed from my research...
- and the newspapers
wrote about it, and it was...
- all because of a mistake.
- Yeah.
I didn't know I destroyed a man's life.
It's not him.
He doesn't know anything.
No one knows anything.
- Did you have a tough day?
- Hi.
Yes. You could say that.
A doctor who smokes?
Like you never cross the
street when the sign is red.
No, I've never done that, No.
- Did you eat?
- No.
Come on. It's on me.
Hi.
Josef? Can you hear me?
You Swedish is very good you know.
- Thank you. You too.
- Thank you.
- What's wrong? You look as if...
- No
- Just work. Never mind.
- Maybe it's something you forgot?
I tend not to forget.
I have a good memory.
What color are my eyes?
- Your hair is blond.
- Yeah.
- And you are wearing a white shirt, right?
- Yes, that's right.
A piece of gold jewelery.
A heart and a small gold water drop.
Your eyes are gray,
but in bright light they appear blue.
Good.
And you have black leather boots on.
- Yes.
- Is there anything else?
No, that's more than enough.
Wait. His feet...
His feet were dirty.
There's something I need to verify.
Sorry, Daniella.
I have to go. See you.
Two, one.
Josef? Breathe.
Should we try again?
It's evening now.
You see your house in front of you.
You want to go inside.
Now we are in your house.
What happens then?
I hide in the darkness.
- Is someone else there?
- Lisa.
She comes running down the stairs.
- What do you do?
- I chase Lisa up the stairs.
- What?
- She is screaming.
- What did you say?
- She is screaming.
Mom, Mo... should not hear it.
Mom can hear me.
I stab.
I stab.
Mother is screaming now.
It's not coming.
- What do you do?
- Go into the bathroom.
- You had met your father earlier?
- Yeah. At the gymnasium.
I just did as she asked.
As she said? Evelyn?
- I must do as she says.
- Who? Evelyn?
I'm sorry. Sorry.
I just did as she asked.
Josef did Evelyn tell you to do it?
My sister.
Evelyn is my sister.
It's me, Erik.
I'm at the hospital.
I believe Josef is the killer.
- It has to be him who...
- I'm on my way there now.
- He has been up walking around.
- What?
I'll be there in a minute.
- I said it.
- So, so.
He wanted me to say it.
Joona Linna here. The officer in charge
at the hospital doesn't respond.
Little friend, can I help you?
Where are you going?
So. Can you keep yourself up? Stand up.
There we go. Let's go back.
It's not long.
I'll get the others.
Where is he? Where is the boy?!
Wait. Stop!
Where is the boy?
How are they doing?
She is being operated on now.
It's critical.
God damn it. God damn it!
Listen. We are still looking.
He can't
have gone far. He's
wounded you know.
I think it's the sister. Evelyn.
- Who made him do all of this.
- Flesh and blood, huh?
Wait. "You are my flesh and blood,
but the family will die."
Evelyn wants Josef to kill his own family.
Yeah.
Do you recognize this?
You're the one who wrote it.
Right?
"You are my flesh and blood,
but the family is going to die."
Josef is your flesh and blood.
You made him kill your parents.
And your little sister.
Were you with him?
Did you use the knife as well?
I didn't do anything.
We know it was Josef who did it.
Who killed them.
He escaped from the hospital last night.
He stabbed a nurse.
Her condition is critical.
Has he been in contact with you?
No.
I have always sensed
that there would be something terrible.
I have been afraid of him all my life.
I don't want to be afraid anymore.
You don't know what kind of person he is.
He was always laughing,
when people got hurt.
He laughed when our dog died.
And it only got worse.
- How?
- Since this summer
He got even more insane.
He ​​hit us.
Shouted that he hated us.
That our mother and father had stolen him,
and they should give him back.
- I will not be afraid anymore.
- Why do you think he said that?
I don't know.
I don't know.
How can you sit there and eat?
What? How can you sit there and eat?
Don't you think of anything but food? Huh?
Do you think that...
Do you think Benjamin is hungry?
Did he...?
But that doesn't matter, you can just
sit there and eat like a pig!
You're just sitting there
stuffing food in your mouth like a pig!
He got even more insane.
He ​​hit us.
Shouted that he hated us.
That our mother and father had stolen him,
and they should give him back.
That our mother and father had stolen him,
and they should give him back.
- Hello. I tried to call.
- Well, something has happened? Come on in.
- Josef is adopted.
- Why would you think that?
Because Evelyn said today that...
- No, but what is wrong?
- Mommy!
Evelyn said Josef accused
their parents of having stolen him.
- Martin?
- What the hell.
What did you say?
It's clear that the letter was written
from a parent to a child.
Josef's?
I think that his biological parents
found him and made contact.
That he was put up for adoption,
and then the parents
could have come in contact with him.
And have gotten him to do this.
- Yes.
- We gotta go. We have to be sure.
We need to send out an APB.
That person is now our prime suspect.
It may also explain why
Benjamin disappeared.
- So we have to go now.
- Yeah.
I need to go talk with Martin.
One new message.
'The hypnotist must die."
Josef's biological mother is
named Lydia Evers.
We didn't find too much about her.
She has been socially
isolated for a long time.
Thank you.
10 years ago Lydia was
committed into psychiatric treatment.
And was discharged six months ago.
Six months ago. But what does it say here?
Josef was forcibly removed,
just before Lydia was hospitalized.
So he was adopted by the Ek family.
Do we have a photo?
- Let's see what it says.
- '99. That's 10 years old.
- She may look completely different.
- Yeah, but she's been gone for a long time.
Hi. What's happening, Simone?
Here's the picture.
Fine. But you need to
tell me about it.
"I see you."
I CAN SEE YOU WHORE.
SOON YOU WILL BE DEAD.
Hello? There...
There's someone threatening my wife.
- Is it happening right now?
- Yes. It's happening right now.
And then the third there. But
there should be ..there's one more, right?
I've packed up four.
I forgot it in the studio.
- I'll get it.
- Let me.
Damn!
What the hell are you doing?
Are you out of your mind?!
But what's happening down there?
- Give us some room.
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.
- What happened?
- Some insane person.
- He threw himself at me with a knife.
- Simone. I heard it over the radio.
- It was a small child!
- I know. Where's Erik?
- Where's Erik?
- Who knows? Maybe at the hospital.
I know who took Benjamin.
But where she is...
- She?
- I'll explain it later.
Josef? Can you hear me?
Was that your real mother,
who told you to do this?
Was it?
Lydia?
Is that your real mother? Is it?
- Where is she now?
- I love her.
- What did you say?
- I love her.
Yes. Where is she?
I have to find her. Josef?
Damn!
Erik!
Hey! Are you alright?
- How long is it going to take?
- Lydia has no credit cards.
No registered address,
and the photo is both bad and old...
- so it is going to take some time.
- Have you heard anything?
- No. We are doing everything we can.
We'll find her and Benjamin.
Try to get some sleep.
Oh, Erik, by the way.
I checked out that Evert Braun.
He was in our records.
Preliminary Research Material.
A few years ago they found
evidence of child abuse.
Unfortunately, not enough to
prosecute, according to the prosecutor.
But I thought you should know.
Do you want a cup of coffee or something?
Sure, why not?
Unfortunately there are a lot of cases
with no indictments...
- even with a very strong set of evidence.
We can't do anything but wait now.
Unfortunately.
- Do you want more?
- No thanks.
I need to check up on Simone.
Ok. I'll be staying with her
for a little while.
I can not remember it.
It's so weird.
Why can I not remember it?
- What?
- Because you were sedated.
But you do see. Right?
I saw... Have to... I can...
What... What if I saw something?
Erik? Help me.
I think I saw something.
- You must follow my instructions.
- Okay.
You should try to trust me.
You must try to let yourself go.
It's stressing me you that you talk so much.
Sit back.
I know that you have a lot of thoughts and
anxiety, but just try to breathe.
Don't try to think so much. Okay?
- No.
- Relax.
- I'm trying, Erik.
- Here. Squeeze my hand in your hand.
Press all you want. Send
everything out and into this hand.
Release all that is holding you back.
Feel the pressure.
Feel my hand, feel your hand.
So let everything be and just breathe
with me. Let yourself sink.
Relax. Sit back.
Just breathe.
Close your eyes.
Breathe with me.
Now. Stay here.
And now you trust only me.
Follow no one but me.
Your entire body becomes calm.
In a moment I will lift your left hand.
You will let me do it. Now.
In a moment I will let go of your arm.
It falls heavily down into your lap.
Now.
I need you to imagine a meadow.
There, in front of you, is a house.
It's our house.
Erik?
Erik!
Erik?
Don't sleep.
I can't. It gets blacked out.
I can't stand on my feet.
Listen to my voice.
Go back to bed where you were asleep...
- and everything is in order.
Now you lie in your bed sleeping.
You feel a pinch.
Is anyone there?
Someone is here.
I can see her.
- I can see her in the mirror.
- What does she look like?
I can see exactly what she looks like.
I can see exactly
what she looks like. Her face.
Can you describe her appearance?
I have seen her.
She is a nurse. She was at the hospital
the same night Josef was hospitalized.
- Pick a number and count forward a little.
- Okay.
There. Hold on.
There she is. Than we can check.
Take number two a little further along.
Take the one on the left. Then number one.
And another angle.
That's the one. And then let it roll.
There.
Print it. And then we need a copy
of the entire file from this sequence.
Do you have a USB-drive?
You wanted a break?
No.
- It sounded like that.
- I do understand why you would believe it.
I did earn that.
I don't even live up
to my own expectations anymore.
Stop it.
If I had not taken all those pills.
Stop it.
If only I could hear his voice.
If I could just hear his voice.
Erik... Sweet Erik.

The bus is sinking!
Take this! Lydia, take my hand! Lydia!
Joona! Here!
Benjamin does it taste good?
Hot.
A message for our customers:
Today, Christmas Eve, we will close at 3 p.m.
I'm working on getting them.
I need some relief.
Hi, Magdalene. Merry Christmas.
I'm in the car eating.
Yeah. Are you home?
I could come by with something.
4912, you're on standby...
- Hello. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas. Sorry to interrupt.
- I just wanted to give this to Tove.
- Why, you...
- Mommy!
- But, don't cry dear.
I'm sorry. Were you scared?
It was just a Christmas elf.
- Come on in, Joona. Come on in.
- I don't know... sorry.
It wasn't my intention to scare you.
