In times when Gods lived 
among mortal men
And men tried to be equal to Gods
in strength and power...
The baby
is kicking
Who do you want?
A brother or a sister
Run along
May my word be quieter than water, 
taller than mountains and heavier than gold
Run away, son, save your mother!
Mezhamir...
Mother, come
Mezhamir
Son, stop!
Don't touch!
Don't touch her!
Get lost
Mother...
Mother, run away...
Quiet!
Not bad, hmm?
Mother, mommy...
Run...
Mother...
Bitch!
Mother...
She's all yours.
Mother...
Mommy
Mother...
Little beast.
Don't kill him.
The cob will go to the mines
He'll rot alive.
He's the sword, sire.
It's actually very good.
It's better than mine.
The blacksmith was a true master.
<b>Wolfhound of the tribe of Grey Hounds/b>
What do you say, Torn Wing?
Farewell.
What is it, my lady?
He kidnapped her. 
Did you see how he laughed me in the face?
Let's go, my dear girl. It's dangerous.
Fool. He doesn't know her secret.
New slave-girl for the master.
Keep going.
The old lord
was a beast and still is one
Vinitar sent me here in vain.
My master will never get along with his father the Maneater
We leave at dawn.
Who are you?
A slave!
The man with the wolf tattoo on the arm
Who was he?
Who was he?
Don't kill me, master!
Get away.
Save me, please. 
Save me.
The master was killed.
Your hand.
Follow me.
Jump.
Come on.
I'm scared.
Don't be. Jump!
Jump...Jump...
Faster.
Hold on.
Stranger!
There's a wall.
There's a secret passage over there...
...you need to turn the candle holder.
Let's go.
Let's take him with us.
Faster, it's closing.
Run. Get out on your own.
Priestess of the Light, Mother Kendarat
Help me find the other one.
Don't.
The world is ruled by love.
The rule of the villain is over.
How did you do it?
The Maneater was undefeatable.
You must have prepared for a long time?
Very long.
I would have loved to do it myself...
How did you know about the secret passage?
I've built this castle.
The Maneater's castle?
Yes.
He really appreciated it, didn't he?
I was waiting for you to come after him.
You were waiting?
A blind man sometimes sees,
what a normal man can't.
You can see the future?
Occasionally.
Can you tell me what's this manuscript is?
It's a key.
A key?
I can't understand it fully...
...but I can feel that we'll find the solution to this mystery...
in Galirad.
What does it open?
This is the key...
...to Heaven Gates.
I knew this could be useful
if the Maneater kept this manuscript safe
We should go to Galirad.
Have you ever been to Galirad, young man?
I have no need there.
May the roads be good to you.
Where are you heading?
There's only one road here - to Galirad.
Could you take with you 
an old man and a girl?
We don't need passengers.
This is a dangerous area.
I don't hire guards on the road.
Let's move.
Stop!
Tell your guards to throw
me off the road
Do it.
Well?
Warrior!
Bring the robe of the princess 
Stop it. Enough.
Take it... Cover yourself.
Stop confusing my army.
What do I call you, new guard?
Call me Wolfhound.
Poor thing.
If I only had a thread and a needle,
I could've fixed you the wing
You can really do it?
Tell your men to put on their armor.
Mind your own business, stranger.
Find her.
Block the road.
Come on, get under the cart.
Faster.
Help...Help
Are you all right? Here, take this.
Where's your mistress?
Where is she?
Tell me!
Tell me!
Come here... it's okay.
You brought them on us.
Leave now.
Stop crying.
It's mine.
I got it in the battle.
Let him have it.
You too, get lost.
Leave.
What?
Should I bring them back??
Hey, stranger!
Come back, it's okay.
Think about your friends.
You can't defend them alone.
Why is he hunting you?
I don't know, master.
Thank gods, we're back.
Here, take it.
Strange, why is it so cold 
in the middle of the summer?
Why is it so cold?
"I see a terrible curse on this city."
"You did not come in vain here, Wolfhound "
"This sword will lead you to the one you seek."
Do you need a sheath or a good armor?
I want to ask you something.
Do you recognize this sword?
Have you seen it before?
I think...
...I've seen it
Whose sword is it?
Make way!
In the name of the king!
Put the scoundrel in chains.
In the morning he will be publicly executed.
Peace be with you, good people.
Sister!
A bright day shines upon Galirad.
Zhadoba has been caught
The old blacksmith recognized him.
This is the truth, my lady. 
Three years ago he slaughtered all my family,
All of them!
With this very sword.
Let me see the sword.
Is it yours?
I won it in battle.
He lies, my lady.
He has a face of a murderer.
What about the creature on his shoulder?
A good man won't keep anything like this?
This man is not Zhadoba.
Sister.
Are you trying to impress everyone?
Louchezar!
It won't work. People in power are lonely.
Louchezar!
He murders people.
The whole city is afraid of him and you...
...want to let him leave?
While your father, my uncle, is away
I rule the city and I decide
Put him in chains.
Don't the servants of Moranna have a special mark?
Yes, a wolf's head tattoo..
On the right hand.
Only Zhadoba has the mark on the hand
The others have the mark on the chest.
Show us your hand.
This is my final judgment.
This man is not Zhadoba..
Stranger, please excuse the old blacksmith
And don't hate my cousin.
Take this gift from me.
And let everyone know that there is justice in Galirad.
I've bought a needle and a strong thread.
You said you can repair the wing.
Make the fire stronger.
Poor little thing.
Let's help you fly.
Hold on, little one.
I saw the princess today.
They thought I was Zhadoba.
She let me go..
Is she beautiful?
Who is Zhadoba?
He is a priest of goddess Moranna.
Like the Maneater?
Secretly they were rivals.
Zhadoba denied his human appearance
and put a mask that he wears all the time.
All this to become stronger than the Maneater
Why?
Each one of them wanted to be the first one 
to awake Moranna the Death
Moranna the Death?
Who is she?
She was a terrible and merciless goddess.
Everything she touched,
turned to stone.
She wanted to turn all the humans into slaves,
her priests would rule them.
During the last war there was a brave man,
he asked for help the god of Thunderstorm.
Together they put her under a curse.
Zhadoba...
Where do I find him?
Look for the wolf where his prey can be found.
Where is his prey?
More often Zhadoba and his men are seen
in the proximity of... Galirad.
Then his prey must be here somewhere.
Take it child.
Put the branch in the fire.
Your ancestors will be glad.
You can ask them to defend you.
Take a look around you...
...your Gods can't protect you.
The whole city is frozen...
...once you have had really warm summer.
Embrace the Twin Gods,
and they will protect you from Moranna.
Just look at this man.
He takes everywhere with him some books
that he calls Holy.
Words of false prophets don't protect him.
He is a slave.
He'll also remain a slave
until he accepts the true gods - Twin Gods
My Gods protect the slaves too.
Protect them?
They can't even protect their own books.
Nevertheless, my Gods are in my heart.
Then maybe you'll prove your case with a sword.
Fight, slave.
Somebody give him a sword.
Take it.
Leave him alone.
Who are you?
I believe in my Gods
and I don't offend other Gods.
Is that so?
Maybe you can't?
Your warrior has lost. Let this man go.
If you pay the ransom.
You've broken my warrior's sword.
Give me yours.
Here's the key from the chains.
Give me your sword.
Then take the slave with his filthy books.
Your cloak is torn.
Get lost, you useless mercenary.
Sell me the sword.
Sell it.
Sell.
I have nothing but books.
Take them.
I just wanted to thank you.
Let's go. You'll eat and sleep.
You have already done too much for me.
As you wish.
Take this, you might need it.
My name is Evrih.
Save him.
Give me your knife.
I need more fire.
The wood is too damp.
Hold on
Hold on.
Child!
Child!
This is a magical powder.
Spare some for yourself.
Where am I?
You're with friends.
Stay in bed, you should gather your strength.
Here, eat this.
Here's another one.
Take it.
Who is the man that calls himself Wolfhound?
We live in troubled times.
Moranna's servants hurt us again and again.
They cause deaths and bad weather.
While there were two competing priests,
we still had hope that
either one will prevail.
But now there are news,
that the Maneater is dead.
That's why I decided to conclude a truce,
with his son Guardian of the Northern Gates
lord Vinitar.
He will protect us from Zhadoba.
For this my daughter princess Elen
will marry him.
The princess will go to her groom to Velimor.
She will be followed by,
the lord's ambassador noble Doungorm
and my nephew...Louchezar.
Your chances for being a ruler are falling apart.
After the wedding lord Vinitar
will become the new ruler...
...of Galirad.
Before leaving I would like to return my debts.
Come forward, warrior.
I return you something you lost, Wolfhound.
And I grant you a cloak.
Now this sword is in good hands.
Thank you for your kindness,
for serving me truthfully.
My lady, get down.
Guards!
Get out of the way!
Move away.
Hold on...hold on...
A servant of Moranna.
Don't be afraid, my child.
Don't be scared.
I won't hurt you.
May my word be silent as water...
...higher than mountains, heavier than gold... 
...and for my words heaven and earth be like gifts...
May my words be as strong as the underground keys.
The world is ruled by love.
It's over...
He'll live.
I had a vision, something that happened
to me a long time ago.
In Diamond Mountains.
A woman saved me when I was dying.
I should have given you an armor
instead of a cloak
Let me ask you something, my lady.
Why did you go to the Maneater?
What makes you say so?
I saw you there.
He stole from me something, I wanted it back.
And you went alone, without guards?
I couldn't trust anyone.
Why Zhadoba is trying to kill you?
Buy yourself an armor!
My lady, wait.
I saved you on the road and now too
you can trust me.
Take me to be your bodyguard.
My lady!
My lady!
Get well, I'll be waiting.
My friend, I need to tell you something important.
Evrih was able to read the writings on the key.
When people chained Moranna the Death
in the Locking Mountains.
The Heaven Gates closed
But I know how to find them
We decided to go there.
Come with us, Wolfhound?
At the entrance to Heaven Gates
each one will find his own destiny.
The princess took me to be her bodyguard.
Listen, Wolfhound.
I can see her hand in the hand of her groom.
But I can also see blood...
...your blood
You shouldn't go with her.
She'll only bring you trouble.
You told me to look for the wolf
where his prey can be found.
I didn't know then who is his prey.
Then so be it.
This is a map with your road marked on it.
Don't use other roads.
Don't let others see it.
I made a copy only for you, for Doungorm...
and for Louchezar.
Please forgive me, child.
I'm sorry.
Don't worry, father.
You did the right thing.
You still can choose another way.
You can change you fate.
Let the Gods decide.
If it's heads, you'll go with her.
I have already decided.
You are together.
My way is different.
My lady.
It's warm outside.
This one
Don't cry, dear.
When I left my tribe I didn't cry
I was younger than you are.
Did you wish to return?
I'm a servant
I was a gift to your grandfather
as a token of piece
I could not return
I guess your fate is similar
Are you the new bodyguard of the princess?
You take rascals to your service, sister?
Stop...
Hello again.
The Great Guardian.
My lady, please return to the carriage
it's dangerous out here
Leave the girl alone.
This is the border of the kingdom of Galirad
let her say farewell.
From here on are foreign lands.
Wolfhound.
Did you leave friends in Galirad?
They left.
Where to?
To find a better place.
Please stay in the carriage
Nonsense
Inside.
Take cover!
Where's your master?
Where's Zhadoba?
Let me go, I'll tell you everything.
A servant of Moranna.
Good thing I caught him in time, sister.
My father's map.
Here.
Why does Zhadoba hunt the lady?
A good man is always a hindrance
for an evil one.
Once...
A blacksmith made a sword
against Moranna the Death.
Then Zhadoba with the Maneater slaughtered 
the whole tribe even the small kids.
...even the smallest kids.
Stop.
Stop!
What is it?
Who are you?
I'm the daughter of the ruler of Galirad
princess Elen.
We came with peace
put down your weapons
let her through
Whatever happens, don't intervene.
But...
It's an order!
Please help. There's a baby here.
He did nothing wrong.
You arrived at a good time.
Our Gods tell us to ask for blessing from strangers.
Mother of tribe Forest Berry, Great Karil
who defeated in combat the black bear himself
Welcomes you in the lands of Kharuks.
Bless our holy court of law and may justice prevail!
Please don't
Help
Whats the crime of this woman and child?
She's a witch
She must die together with the monster
What's her crime?
She cursed my family.
She cursed our family
Tell me how it happened, wise ruler?
She came from afar and told us she was a healer.
She even tried to treat our children.
And when the wife of the son of Great Karil
went to the forest to have a baby
The witch followed her,
against the law of the ancestors
and delivered the baby
The Gods are furious
and now the baby is worthless
He is sickly and feeble
Please allow me to look.
This is my doctor
he won't do any harm.
Here. Pleas help.
This was a miracle.
The baby was supposed to die in birth.
She saved him.
He lies.
My son's baby cannot be worthless.
release this woman, I'll take her with me.
Try me!
Don't...
Wolfhound.
Take the baby away.
Thank you, Grey Hound.
How do you know about my tribe?
I know a lot of things.
A nice tribe you have
Had a tribe
No one's left
You are left
I'm the last one
Wolfhound
I grant you a flask, Wolfhound.
for bravery
Are you tired?
Hold on a little longer
We're half way to the Heaven Gates
Tilorn what do you think?
Will we ever see Wolfhound again?
I don't know
He is challenging his fate again
And the fate doesn't always appreciate it
What waits him in the future...
...only stars can tell
Who taught you to fight?
My lady
Who taught you to fight, Wolfhound?
I had many teachers
Will you teach me?
No
Why not?
Once a woman saved me.
She was very wise.
She said that the world is ruled by love.
Do you also believe it?
No
Everything is up to force
That's the reason you learned to fight?
teach me
what for, my lady?
Please teach me what to do
when I'm being attacked.
Like that time on the road
I need it
I can hurt you
Teach me
Hit me
What?
hit me.
Who are you afraid of, my lady?
Zhadoba?
Show me again.
No.
Hit me.
Hit me.
again...
again...
once more...
and again...
Stop!
The old road is shorter
We'll take it
There's the Kayeran Marsh there.
So what?
There are ghosts there.
The priests of Moranna can raise them at night from the marsh.
You're getting too old.
Master.
Don't tempt the Gods
Think about the girl
Sister...
Are you too afraid of the ghosts?
Or your bodyguard doesn't allow it?
The Kayeran Marsh is a homeland of Zhadoba.
Wolfhound.
Whatever you decide, my lady
Wolfhound!
We'll take the old road
But mistress...
We are taking the old road.
Look, what I found for you Vereya.
Do you like it? Yes, I do.
Here, put this on.
Wolfhound.
Why did you choose the old road?
Never mind
Do you believe in ghosts?
My grandfather saw them
Once he and his friends spent a night here,
during the night they heard a horn.
Grandfather said that never in his life
he had ever heard such a dreadful sound.
Then they saw some shadows in the mist,
they came nearer and nearer,
Suddenly people began disappearing.
A temple of Moranna?
Unlikely. It's a good shelter.
Where have you been, Wolfhound?
I hired a bodyguard for myself, not for Ertan.
I'm sorry, my lady.
You're right. Those who rule are always lonely.
Sister, do you miss Galirad?
If you have to choose...
...your life or Galirad, what would it be?
You know the answer.
And if it was my life or Galirad?
Why do you ask?
My lady, when you go to bed
don't undress and put your armor on.
Nonsense!
Put it on. Please!.
Alarm!
Princess.
Follow me.
Everyone to the temple.
Over here.
Take cover.
Don't be afraid.
Here's a piece of cloth, my lady.
Zhadoba...
Zhadoba...
Zhadoba...
What is it?
This is how Moranna's priests call for ghosts.
It is afraid of the fire.
Catch, Wolfhound.
Where are you going?
Ancient Gods, help us, protect us, save us.
I don't ask for myself.
Help us, show your power.
Louchezar
Sister. Louchezar.
Thank Gods, you're alive.
We drove them away.
We saved the carriages and the dowry.
Zhadoba fled.
Send a messenger to the groom.
Tell him to come to meet us.
Give it to the lord himself.
You said the plan would succeed.
It's her bodyguard again.
Maybe youve changed your mind?
She sent a messenger to Velimor.
The groom is on his way here.
Do you love your sister?
I raised her.
What about Galirad?
Spare her.
I know you can break the curse another way.
She will die.
Tonight you'll bring me to her.
If she doesnt die now,
I'll kill her another time.
But Galirad will already be ruled by her groom.
He will be king, not you.
This is juice of a sleeping weed.
Add it to the bodyguard's flask.
A beautiful song.
Slaves in far mountains sing it.
What is it about?
It tells that anyone
can change his fate.
Nobody can change the fate.
Not a slave, not even a king.
The songs tells the opposite.
There was a slave in the mines in Diamond Mountains.
He challenged the most fierce slave-driver
and defeated him.
Then he regained his freedom.
Nobody else managed to do it, just him.
A song was written about him.
Go, the girl calls for you.
This song was about you.
A slave who returned and revenged
the slaughter of his whole tribe.
You killed the Maneater, didn't you?
I did.
A long time ago...
...one of my ancestors...
...defeated Moranna the Death.
He locked her heart near the entrance
to the Heaven Gates.
I'm the only keeper of the secret.
This is the reason why
Moranna's servants hunt me.
Zhadoba believes...
...that if I die, the curse will be lifted.
The Maneater thought that it was enough
to get the manuscript.
It was the most precious thing in Galirad.
Was?
Yes, he stole it from me.
Then the winter came to the city.
My friends have the manuscript.
Your friends?
They have to bring it back.
They must return it to the temple in Galirad.
Only then it will be warm again in the city.
They don't know about it.
They left for the Heaven Gates, to open them.
They won't succeed.
They deciphered the magical words.
In order to open the Heaven Gates
They have to free Moranna.
And to accomplish that,
my blood needs to be spilled on the manuscript
I want a son...
...not from the groom
I've never seen in my life...
...I want a son from you, Wolfhound.
Wolfhound...
Wolfhound...
Princess...
Who are you?
I'm the princess' bodyguard.
Where's my bride?
My lord!
Stop!
My lord.
This is the dog, that killed your father.
Lord Vinitary known as Maneater,
was my father.
You killed him.
Defend yourself.
Slave!
Wolfhound!
Wolfhound!
Don't.
The maid.
Wolfhound...
Wolfhound...
They...
...took her to the Locking Mountains
Who?
Louchezar and Zhadoba.
They will...
...sacrifice her to ... Moranna
Where were you, Wolfhound?
She ... she called for you.
...she called...
No.
Don't shoot
He'll lead us to her.
What is it?
Come on, where are you.
Help me here.
A devil.
Come on, together
What takes you so long?
Princess!
Wolfhound!
Wolfhound, I knew you'll come for us.
They caught us on the road
and they took the manuscript.
Where's the princess?
I'm sorry, sister.
Kill him.
Run. Run and save the princess.
Hurry, hurry.
Wolfhound
Run, princess!
Wolfhound!
Run, my lady, run...
Stop!
Run away.
Child.
Catch the princess.
Come here!
Let's go.
Stop in the name of Vinitar.
Wolfhound!
My God...
God of Thunderstorm!
Help, for the sake of good people...
Fire, I need fire.
Please...
Don't die, Wolfhound.
Wolfhound
This is my brother?
This is what you gave others, child.
Get up, Wolfhound?
Otherwise, who will revive the tribe of Grey Hounds?
Look, the Heaven Gates have opened.
My lady,
here's your groom.
This is your bride.
Wolfhound
You changed the destiny, Wolfhound.
Fate has no power over you.
You make your own fortune.
