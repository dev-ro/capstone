You didn't go to Boston.
No.
I tell that prick I'm gonna have $1,000...
...I'm gonna have a thou.
-I'm still $50 short.
-What has that got to do with anything?
Everything.
Business is business.
You gotta keep your word.
Your word is your reputation.
You lose your reputation,
and you're out of business.
You're not talking about business,
you're talking about your own ego.
Ego, reputation, what's the difference?
That's what I just said.
Anyway, my customers are just
gonna have to wait 'till I get me $50.
-Good.
-Good?
Shit.
Rich broads.
You never had to make a buck in your life.
I have to go out and hustle every day.
What are you doing?
Just sitting there in the bathtub
on your fat ass.
We ain't got nothing here.
We can't move.
And we ain't got much left
in the old cookie jar either.
But, Frank, you promised.
Maybe we could stay off the hard stuff
for a while and just smoke.
Yeah, but when I make this deal...
...we ain't even gonna
have to leave the house.
We can just groove and groove.
You can go down and get yourself
a year's supply of peanut butter.
I can get the hi-fi out of hock.
I can go to Netty's, get some brushes...
...and some paints and an easel
and a mile of canvas.
-Who paints?
-I paint.
You know I love you.
You got love, you don't need this stuff.
Is that the message?
Well, I love you, too.
So there.
You know, I was only kidding...
...about your painting.
I really like your paintings.
You're not gonna take that much yourself,
are you?
-You want a poke?
-No.
You didn't ask me where I was today.
Where do you think I was?
Did you think I was with some other guy?
-I went to my parents'.
-What the hell did you go there for?
It was near, my mother's birthday
was coming up, and....
I don't like to be here all by myself
when you're away.
And anyhow,
why should that freak you out so much?
It freaks me out.
You know it freaks me out.
How about some music?
Here.
That's okay.
You don't have to do this for me.
I understand about your parents.
It's got nothing to do with my parents.
Come on, babe, let's make love.
That fucking radiator!
When are you going to move the bed?
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna get me that $50.
That's crummy.
You promised
you weren't gonna do that anymore.
-You want me to sell my stuff?
-No.
So instead of a trip,
the teeny boppers get vitamin pills.
I'm doing them a favor. Shit.
With a line like that, I could run for mayor.
Please don't go. I don't feel very good.
Frank!
You'll be okay. I'll be right back.
It can't take too long.
Pop one up if you have to.
You'll feel great.
See you.
-How do I know it's any good, man?
-It's so good, you'll wish it wasn't so good.
-I got beat last week.
-That was last week. Now is now.
How about a taste up front?
Sorry, man. No samples. It's too good.
Let me see it man, okay?
Sure.
Here's a satisfied customer.
I don't need that, man.
Sit down.
Look, she's a bum tripper.
If your head's on straight, like yours is,
it's a groove.
It's dynamite.
It's you.
I'm hip.
You're a big help.
-I don't feel so good.
-Shit.
-Take it.
-No.
I said, take it.
Take it.
Now, go home.
Fifteen minutes, you'll be floating.
I just have one more pass to make,
and then I can get the stuff.
Okay?
Now, stop being such a drag,
for Christ's sake!
Hey, honey, what are you doing?
Hey, wait a minute.
-Take it easy.
-Let me go!
You'll be all right.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
-Easy, easy.
-Let go.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
That's it.
Sgt. O'Connor? Mr. Miller from
the Second Avenue bargain store.
Fine, sir.
We have a young girl here
who's flipped out.
Looks like she's OD'd on speed.
Hippie. You better send an ambulance.
Second and 7th.
You've got a weird sense of humor,
Sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Thank you. Good-bye.
She's coming down now
from the amphetamine.
A 100 milligrams of Thorazine
in the butt does wonders.
If you want her effects,
you can pick them up in the property room.
-Would you like to see her now?
-Yes, please, very much.
You won't have to stay here.
No, darling, you're going to Rivercrest.
It's a beautiful place, not like here.
No locked doors.
And Dr. Bergman said
you could be out within a week.
And when you come home, darling,
we'll all go someplace.
Maybe the Islands.
Frank would understand.
Listen, honey,
when you come out, we'll try again.
You know what I mean, talk it over and....
Maybe we haven't been as open
as we could.
We'll work it out, honey. It'll be okay.
I don't think this is such a good idea.
Go back, I'll do it myself.
No, she'll be furious.
Now that she's out of this environment,
maybe she'll come to her senses.
Good luck.
The smell, Bill,
I'm getting sick to my stomach.
I don't want to go up there.
I don't want to see it.
Will you stop bitching?
This is your own daughter.
For once in your life,
can you do something for her...
...without looking for
a convenient excuse not to?
You bastard!
I'll say this for you:
You're consistent, you don't change.
Go to Hell. And you can do it yourself.
All right, I will. It's no novelty.
Keep going, and make a right.
Okay. Who's got $10?
-No, wait a minute, let's see it first.
-Sure.
Is it any good?
Yeah, it's dynamite.
-You sure?
-Yeah, would I kid you?
-Okay.
-$10.
How long will it last?
As long as you want.
Depends on your head.
If we take it now,
will we be okay on the street?
Sure, anywhere you want.
-Have fun.
-Yeah, thanks.
-What's your name, man?
-The Lone Ranger.
Okay, well, you go first.
-No, that's okay, you can go first.
-All right, scaredy-cat, here.
Who are you?
Melissa's in the hospital.
I'm picking up her clothes.
Oh, you're Daddy.
I should've recognized the nose.
How's she doing?
Why, you want to bring her
some more pills?
Don't sweat the small stuff, she'll be okay.
Melissa told us you were handsome.
Rugged, she says.
Strong.
Intense.
-With great talent.
-Yeah?
Yes.
But as far as I can see,
you're a weak little bastard...
...who couldn't paint his way
out of a toilet.
How's things in the advertising world?
We can't all be geniuses.
How are your toasters doing?
You know,
Melissa's got a real hang-up about you.
You done a real groovy job on her.
That's pretty good,
from what Melissa says about her old lady.
I see you still got some balls.
Shut up!
She's got a real thing about you.
When I met her, she was balling
her way up the aisle at the film...
...and every now and then,
she used to like to try an old codger.
Get up! Get up, you skinny fucker!
Get up!
Oh, God.
Jesus!
The niggers.
The niggers are getting all the money.
Why work?
You tell me, why the fuck work...
...when you can screw,
have babies, and get paid for it?
Welfare. They got all that welfare money.
They even get free rubbers.
You think they use them?
Hell, no, the only way they make money
is making babies.
They sell the rubbers...
...and then they use the money
to buy booze.
Nobody has a right to booze
unless he earns the money.
It ought to be a law.
You don't work, you don't drink.
The social workers, the ones in Welfare....
How come they're all nigger lovers?
Ever notice that?
All those social workers are nigger lovers.
Find me a social worker
who ain't a nigger lover...
...and I'll massage your ass. I ain't queer.
-Scotch and water.
-Double for 90 cents, you save a dime.
I sweat my balls off 40 hours a week
in front of a fucking furnace.
They get as much money as I do
for nothing.
They got them living in hotels at $50 a day,
$1,000 a month.
Now they want charge accounts.
Charge accounts.
I ain't even been inside Macy's,
and they want charge accounts.
All you gotta do is act black,
and the money rolls in.
Set fire to the cities, burn a few buildings,
you get paid for it.
Throw a few bombs,
you get money and jobs.
If you can't read,
you got a better chance of getting hired.
A lot of good my education did me.
And the kids, the white kids.
They're worse than the niggers.
Money don't mean nothing to them.
Motorcycles, marijuana, $5 records.
The dollar ain't worth shit.
I get a 30-cent-an-hour increase.
My wife bought
better hamburger last year.
I got a kid.
Screw him. I got another kid.
Couldn't get into a regular college.
You want to know why?
My kid ain't dumb.
Couldn't get into college
because they let the niggers in first.
That's how they're saving the cities.
They keep the smart niggers busy
wrecking the colleges.
Yeah, my kid's grades....
Not like those kids in Chicago.
Chicago! They got no respect
for the President of the United States.
A few heads get bashed in,
they act like they got it in the ass.
Liberals.
42% of all liberals are queer.
That's a fact.
The Wallace people took a poll.
And don't tell me about Communists.
How can a kid be a Communist?
Kids are idealistic.
-Yes, P-Q-3 please.
-They used to be idealistic.
Now they're going to those peace marches.
This is William Compton.
Could you tell me how my daughter is?
They're so whacked out on drugs,
they need candles to find their way.
Oh? Well, when will he be back?
-The white kids....
-Would you ask him to call me?
-The rich white kids....
-Yes, the number here is....
-The worst, hippies....
-7-2-4....
Sugar tit all the way:
the cars, the best colleges...
...vacations, orgies...
-Yes, William Compton.
-...Christmas, Easter.
Thank you.
They go someplace,
like a fancy resort, and have orgies.
Easter orgies.
The day Christ rose,
they're all screwing one another.
The poor kids and the middle-class kids...
...they're all copying the rich kids.
They're all going the same
goddamn "screw America" way.
Hippies.
Joe, do me a favor. Give us all a break.
Can it a while.
Here's a quarter.
Go play the juke box, okay?
Want to do it again?
What's the matter, you got all those
opinions, and you can't pick a record?
Look at this shit music.
Those goddamn nigger-loving hippies,
they even fucked up the music.
I'd like to get my hands on
one of those little bastards.
I'd kill 'em. I'd like to kill one of them.
They're getting away with murder.
Sex, drugs, pissing on America,
fucking up the music.
I'd like to kill one of 'em.
I would.
I'd like to kill one of 'em.
I just did.
Glad to hear it.
Hey, you're serious!
You're really serious!
For Christ's sake, you had me going for it,
you had me believing you!
Jesus, you're a great kidder, Mac.
You had me going for it. I went for it.
You're puttin' me on. Terrific.
What are you drinking?
Hey, Pete, give this guy a drink.
No kidding, you're all right, Mac.
My name is Joe, Joe Curran.
What's yours?
Anyone here called William Compton?
He's all right, know what I mean?
Anybody who can set me in like that....
-Hello?
-Anybody who can make me laugh....
Yes.
-They're all right, you know.
-Doctor?
She is. Good.
Yes, tell her.
-This world needs a lot of laughs.
-Thank you. Good-bye.
You know?
You gotta be able to laugh, to roll with it.
Hey, Compton, I bought you a drink.
What is this?
Where have you been?
What in the world happened?
Where are Melissa's things?
What's wrong? Look at yourself, darling.
What happened?
Honey, are you about ready to go to bed?
Yeah, I'm gonna watch the 11:00 news.
-I'm gonna go on now.
-Okay.
Come on.
Come on, now, get in there, bastard.
Get in there, you bastard.
Hi, honey.
What's for supper?
Guess.
Come on.
No, guess.
For Christ's sake, tell me.
-It's on the stove, look.
-You got covers on, come on.
We're having mashed potatoes,
the way you like them, lumpy...
...and a nice piece of chuck steak,
the way you like, with onions and ketchup.
Heinz?
Yes, I'll never do that again,
buy the supermarket kind.
-You're right about ketchup.
-That's my girl.
And a nice piece of
Jane Parker chocolate fudge cake.
I tell the guys what a good cook you are.
You know,
my sandwiches are better than theirs.
How was Samantha Cartwright today?
She wasn't on so very much,
but a lot happened to her.
She's in the hospital
having her kidneys removed.
And while she's in the hospital,
her daughter, Kim...
...is being seduced by a lawyer...
...and her son, Biff, is getting
a little crushed in an elevator accident.
And it looks like her husband, Derek...
...is interested in her best friend, Phoebe.
While she's having her kidneys taken out...
...you see the knife going in,
Derek gives Phoebe such a look.
That woman, she has such courage.
That's my favorite program,
The Searching Light.
How was Mabel Archer?
Oh, well,
looks like things are looking up for her.
Looks like she's gonna have
a father for her baby.
The guy who knocked her up'll marry her?
-No.
-The guy she's in love with?
No, the gentleman she met
at the drugstore.
It looks like something's happening
between them.
What happened down the block?
-The boys are out.
-I see the boys are out. What happened?
Brian has a date with Patty,
the girl who wears the Indian headband?
She wears an Indian headband.
Mary Lou, are you gonna answer me?
They moved in.
They don't look so bad for Colored, Joe.
What are you gonna do?
Shit, where's Phil?
He's out riding.
He picked up the Harley Davidson today.
He got it? Shit.
I'm going to go downstairs. Call me.
It's not going to be very long.
It's just gonna....
...black militants abroad.
Overseas agents of
the Federal Bureau of Investigation...
...and the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs...
...originally scheduled for reduction....
The van came about 11:00.
They got nice furniture for Colored.
Have a real nice Castro
and a fancy bedroom suite.
...pose a serious threat
to our government....
The kids are cute. They're clean, too.
New York's Greenwich Village.
I think they're real high-class Colored...
...different from anything around here.
-...in an apartment on 4th Street.
-Hold it.
The man, Frank Russo, had been dead
three days according to the examiner.
-I think he's not going--
-Shut up!
Russo, sometime painter,
had been selling drugs, police said.
Investigation revealed that
he had picked up a large shipment...
...the day that he was killed.
Police believe Russo was killed by a junkie
who then fled with the drugs.
Detectives say there are no leads
to the killer at the present time.
Albany: Federal State crime investigators
are expected to serve subpoenas...
...on state government figures
possibly involved...
...with illegal activities of the Mafia.
The subpoenaed witnesses will be ordered
to appear before two grand juries...
...probing malfeasance and bribery.
Mr. Compton's office.
Hello, Mr. Compton, please.
Joe Curran.
Yeah, you do that.
There's a Mr. Curran on the line.
Who?
Joe Curran.
I don't know him. Tell him I'm busy.
Mr. Compton is in conference.
Tell him I'm Joe Curran,
the guy he met in the bar the other night...
...and bought him a drink.
I wanna talk to him now.
Very well.
What?
He says he met you in a bar the other night
and bought you a drink.
Okay, I'll talk to him.
Hello?
Hello, Compton.
Listen, I wanna see you.
How did you get my number?
You're the only one in the book.
The maid gave me your office.
Look, Compton, we gotta get together.
Look, you meet me at the Bowl-a-drome
around 6:00.
That's Camwood and Grant Street
in Astoria.
Around 6:00, okay?
Yes, okay.
I'll see you then.
Okay.
Compton. Over here.
Hey, you look okay, pal.
Hey, everybody, listen.
I want you to meet a great guy.
This guy's got real balls...
...not no bowling balls.
This is Jack, Sam, Michael,
he don't like to be called Mike, and Art.
Would you like to bowl a frame? Come on.
I bet you haven't had much exercise
for a couple of days.
Here we go.
Hey, you creeps,
this guy's gonna bowl a frame for me.
Come on, show these bums.
My shoes.... Street shoes.
Fuck the shoes, come on.
-Maybe your buddy ought to stick to golf.
-Golf?
Screw it, forget it.
This game's for morons, anyway.
Come on,
you guys got chalk in your brains.
Hey, Jack,
finish this string for me, will you?
Come on, I want to talk to you.
Couple of beers, please, Sylvia.
Catch you later.
You know when it hit me?
When I saw the paper.
The TV started me thinking.
The paper, I knew.
Couldn't get over it.
Why?
Why did you call me?
I wanted to meet you.
I know what you've been thinking.
You been thinking I was going to
put the old squeeze on you, didn't you?
That's what you been thinking, right?
Yes.
The thought had occurred to me.
I could blackmail you.
Hey, don't worry about it.
I just wanted to shake your hand.
I mean...
...there I am, sitting in a bar...
...drunk, and shooting off....
Just words...
...and you come in.
And you did it! You did it!
I just talk about it, but you did it!
When I get drunk, I let off a lot of steam.
Drink up.
I know a better place.
Thank you.
Listen, nobody's gonna blame you...
...a guy like that, your daughter.
There're plenty of people with kids,
I'm telling you, you'd be a hero.
The guy was selling dope, right?
So now he can't make dope fiends
out of anybody anymore, can he?
Yeah, that's right.
God knows how many kids he hooked.
Maybe....
Maybe that's why I get this....
I had it a couple of times lately.
The feeling of...
...pleasure?
Satisfaction.
Yeah, like in the war.
You remember how you felt in the war
sometimes, after you killed a few of them?
You feel bad and you feel good
at the same time?
Yes, well, something like that.
Not exactly.
You make a lot of money.
How much?
What do you make an hour?
They pay us by the year, Joe.
I get $4 an hour...
...plus some that I don't count
because the union keeps it.
That's $160 a week.
That ain't so bad, it's not so bad.
I mean, shit, you can't live on it.
What do you make?
$60,000.
$60,000 a year!
You gotta be kidding.
Only movie stars make that kind of money.
The fucking president of my union
pays himself that kinda money.
$60,000 a year.
You gotta kiss a lot of ass, I bet.
After a while, you don't notice it, I guess.
You think I don't have to kiss ass?
$4 an hour?
The foreman, the shop steward,
the guy on the night shift...
...so he don't leave my furnace a mess.
Bet you got a pile saved, though.
No, not really a pile, only about...
...$18,000.
$18,000, the kind of money you make?
I got $10,000. My wife don't know it.
Yeah, and two lots in Florida.
Hey, look at that.
Look at that.
Nice.
I like to look at 'em once in a while.
You like to look at 'em once in a while?
Yes, I like to look at it once in a while.
A little on the side once in a while?
Once in a while.
That helps, you know,
so you don't resent the old lady so much.
Right?
You know, guys like us...
...we don't often get a chance
to talk to each other.
-Find it hard talking to me?
-No.
Yes, you do.
I'm just a working stiff,
and you're way up there.
Educated.
Just talk to me the way you would...
...somebody at the office,
a friend, like that.
Would you like to see
where my kind of animal hangs out?
Sure.
Good. Now, let's get the hell out of here.
They look like a bunch of fags.
Not really fags, but close, getting there.
What would you like, sir?
-Johnnie Walker on the rocks and....
-The same.
Yeah, but they're smart.
They gotta be smart, right?
You want to see
how smart they really are? Watch.
Bill, baby, how are you?
Gil. It's good to see you.
I'd like you to meet Joe Curran.
-This is Gil Richards.
-Happy to meet you.
Same here.
By the way, Gil, Joe here is....
-Shall I tell him, Joe?
-Oh, yeah.
It hasn't been officially announced yet,
but Joe here is moving over to your shop.
Oh, yeah?
What spot?
Guess.
Hell, I don't know. Which....
Come on, Gil, what have they been
looking for over there for three months?
Exec VP?
That's it.
I know he looks a little rough,
but that's just part of his act.
He'll be looking things over
pretty closely over there.
Getting rid of a lot of dead wood.
You'll shake it up over there, won't you?
I'll shake things up. That place will
shake like a hurricane when a tree hit it.
When you come in, drop by my office.
Nah, why don't you drop by my office?
Yeah, sure. I'll see you.
Look, no hands, doctor's orders.
Can't lift anything heavier than 10 pounds.
Hey, they got ice down there.
I never pissed on ice before.
-Don't catch cold.
-I'll try not to.
Feels good!
This is one of nature's simple enjoyments.
I needed that, you know.
After you, my dear Alphonse.
All right.
Now, you see those buildings, Joe?
Those beautiful monuments...
...concrete, glass.
I work in one of them.
You know what they do in those buildings?
They move paper.
That's right. They pick it up in one place...
...and they move it to another place.
They pass it all around their offices.
And the more paper you move...
...the more important you are,
the more they pay you.
If you want to really show
how important you are...
...what you can get away with...
...you make little paper airplanes...
...and you sail them
right up somebody else's ass.
Do you ever get the feeling
that everything you do...
...your whole life,
just one big crock of shit?
Yeah.
I got a great idea. Wanna go huntin'?
-Hunting?
-Yeah.
I haven't gone hunting in years.
-I got a great place, you know.
-Yeah?
You should've seen the buck
I got last year, big one.
-You know what else you gotta do?
-What?
You gotta come out to the house,
meet the little woman...
...have a little dinner with us,
see how the other half lives, okay?
Okay, Joe.
-Okay, Compton?
-It's a deal.
Take care, Compton, and just remember...
...you don't have anything
to worry about, okay?
You won't believe this, darling,
but I have just been...
...with a guy who knows.
What?
It's all right. He likes me.
Rest up.
The doctor said only a few more days.
-I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
-Okay.
-Good-bye, darling.
-Bye, mother.
Well, say good-bye to daddy for me.
-Excuse me.
-Yes, surely.
-Hi.
-Phyllis. How'd you ever find me?
Spies.
-Hey, you don't look so bad.
-Well, I could look a lot worse.
My mother was just here.
She's been here every day, twice a day.
Twice a day?
Well, she can't be that bad.
You ought to meet my mother.
Well, so how's Frank?
Stop it, for Christ's sake!
You'd think the Pope was comin'!
What am I gonna talk to her about?
You never had any trouble
talkin' with the girls.
Shuttin' you up was the problem.
Joe, I didn't dust.
Look, you buy curtains, she buys curtains.
I give you a few bucks in Gimbels,
you go crazy.
You give her a few bucks in Gimbels,
she goes crazy.
-She doesn't shop at Gimbels, Joe.
-Okay, she goes to Macy's.
Women got a lot to talk about, they think.
Relax.
Won't be any worse than the time
your rich aunt came over...
...the one who didn't leave us any money.
-Hi.
-Joe.
Come in.
Mary Lou's been dyin' to meet you.
-Mary Lou, this is Bill Compton.
-It's a pleasure.
Hello. My wife, Joan.
How do you do?
-Hello.
-Nice knowin' you.
Here, let me take your coats.
Take their coats, honey.
-Let me help.
-Sure.
My best friend in high school
was named Mary Lou.
I loved her name.
I always wished I had it. I hated mine.
-Well, you've got a nice name, Joan.
-Thank you.
Well, I'll just be a minute.
I can see we're gonna get along real good.
What'll you have, a Bud or 7 and 7?
Bud or 7 and 7?
We got ginger ale, too.
Yes, how will you have your
Seagram's 7 Crown, dear?
Ginger ale or 7-Up?
Ginger ale's fine, thank you.
Ginger ale, beautiful.
And for the gentleman?
-Bud.
-Bud, the king of beers.
-Where's the ginger ale?
-Under the....
-I thought you keep it on the shelf.
-I do keep it on the shelf, but--
Did you have any trouble findin' the place?
No, Joe. Your instructions were perfect.
Terrific.
-Joe?
-Yeah.
-Pretty nice place you got here.
-Yeah, it's not much.
You never told me you had a girlfriend
named Mary Lou in high school.
I made it up.
God, you can be charming
when you wanna be.
I hope you don't mind the can.
No. It helps to keep them fresh.
Nice nuts.
No, thanks. I mustn't spoil my appetite.
-Do you mind if I shut the window?
-No, go right ahead.
I love your curtains.
Thank you.
See, what'd I tell you?
They was 49 cents a yard, reduced from 79.
I made 'em myself,
and the saleslady told me that...
...Debbie Reynolds had been in
and bought the same material.
That's enough.
All day.
She was wonderin' what you
was gonna talk about.
I told her you was both women.
That's right. We're all alike.
What'd you mean by that?
That's the restaurant.
We're going to have something
real special for dinner. Chinese.
Lou Wong's is the best Chinese....
The best Chinese restaurant
in Astoria, it's--
-I hope you like Chinese food.
-I love it.
Yes, love it.
Give me the box. They look better
when they're all lined up here together.
The boys just hate Chinese food.
That's why they're out.
Hell, that's not why they're not home,
they're never home, not even the good one.
Joe's real funny about the boys.
He likes 'em right here when he comes in.
What he'd like is to have 'em all lined up,
military fashion, in the doorway...
...when he comes home, sayin', "Hi, Pop."
Yeah.
I was really sorry to hear
about your daughter. Is she okay?
She's fine, thank you.
Kids.
Everything today's kids.
They make you feel so old-fashioned,
you know?
We made our parents feel
old-fashioned, but...
...we didn't make them feel old-fashioned
like the kids make us feel old-fashioned.
Everything today's kids.
-They are taking over the culture.
-The what?
The culture:
the movies, books, clothes, music.
Yeah, yeah.
They're all screwed up,
so they got control of the culture, right?
They're all screwed up,
so they're screwin' up the culture.
It ain't what the kids say,
we screwed them up.
It's the other way around,
with all that culture crap.
It's the kids who are screwin' us up.
Am I right?
Yes, of course.
Fuckin' A.
-You mean, she knows you killed a junkie?
-Yes, she knows.
-What'd you do, go and tell her?
-No, she figured it out, just as you did.
Christ. Here.
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry, relax.
Joan, I got something I wanna show you.
Joe, she don't wanna see your guns.
Sure she does, it'll just take a minute.
-What the hell did you go and do that for?
-Don't worry, you'll see.
Look, it's not the gun, I just wanted to
get you away from Mary Lou.
See, look.
I want to tell you not to worry
about a thing...
...'cause nothing's gonna happen to you.
Your husband's a great guy,
and nothin's gonna happen to him.
The police in this town ain't gonna
bust their ass over one junkie murder.
See, a guy who kills one junkie
might kill another junkie.
So why bust him? He's doin'
such good work for the cops, see?
That make you feel better?
Yes, thank you.
Okay, now I want you to go upstairs,
I want you to relax.
I want you to enjoy yourself
with Mary Lou, okay?
I got here what you might call
a well-balanced gun collection, see?
I wrote a letter to an ammo magazine,
and they wrote back, sayin':
"You got a well-balanced collection," see?
Now, this I got off a Jap,
a dead Jap on Okinawa.
Then I got.... Here, hold this.
Here is my old M-1. There's a lotta stories
behind that, believe me.
Right on the Park?
Yes, it is lovely. We have a beautiful view.
I never been in an apartment
like that before, never.
I always wondered what it'd be like,
what it'd look like on the inside.
-I always wanted to see.
-We'll have you and Joe up one day.
-You will?
-Yes, of course.
That'd be nice. What about next week?
Tuesday, Saturday....
Saturday'd be good for us.
I got a lot of other stuff over here, too.
Got some handguns, some shotguns.
I got a couple of trophies
for marksmanship.
I'm a real good shot. But this....
This is my beauty. It's a submachine gun.
You're not supposed to have 'em,
but I got one anyway.
You can do a lot of damage with this.
It's got a lot of stoppin' power.
Thanks for letting me in.
Before we were finished, we practically
worked out a full year's social calendar.
I think we have a free weekend
sometime in April or May.
Are you ready to put him up
for the athletic club?
I wouldn't mind letting him sit in
on one of our creative sessions...
...and let him tell everybody
what a bunch of windbags they are.
He wouldn't put it quite like that.
You know,
after years of nothing but ad types...
...Mary Lou, Joe,
they're a refreshing change.
Refreshing?
Well, different?
That's for sure.
Lord, I've been in grisly situations before,
but this....
Sitting in that room,
him knowing about Frank...
...and you and me knowing about Frank...
...and big-eyed Mary Lou, yammering away.
Does he know all the gory details, darling?
No.
When I think.... I just get the shudders.
When you think
that man holds our lives in his hand....
It's like sitting on a powder keg.
A couple of times tonight,
I said something, and he was...
...just about to explode.
If he gets mad at you, do you know
he can go straight to the police?
No, you see...
...the crazy thing about Joe is that...
...it's as if he shared in it.
As if he killed that boy, too.
You have to keep on the good side of him.
Isn't that what we were
really doing there tonight?
There's something else about Joe.
Sometimes, with him...
...I almost feel as if what I did was
a humanitarian act.
I saved the world
from another lousy junkie.
-Funny, isn't it?
-What?
How you can learn to live with anything...
...even murder.
I'll drink to that.
Melissa.
How did you get out of the hospital?
Why didn't you tell me about Frank?
Why didn't you tell me Frank was dead?
Because we didn't want to upset you.
Not while you were in the hospital.
Is that the reason?
Certainly, you were just coming down
from the drugs.
Or was the subject too painful?
I heard you, Daddy. You killed Frank.
And I loved him. I loved him.
Melissa. You stay here. I'll get her.
Melissa, I wanted to tell you.
-I wanted to tell you how it happened.
-It doesn't matter. It happened, that's all.
-You might understand.
-No!
-Melissa.
-Leave me alone!
-You've got to listen to me.
-Are you gonna kill me, too?
"There is some consternation
in these quarters...
"...about the allocation of spots to stations.
"I'd like you to reexamine them
from the point of view of demographics...
"...and market proceedings."
Paragraph.
"I know this puts you under pressure,
but we'd like it within a week.
"I'll commiserate with you over drinks."
Signature.
Janine, I know my behavior has been
a little erratic the last few days.
Well, it's likely to continue so
for a little while longer.
You know, running in and out of the office.
So just keep covering for me, will you?
I always do.
Thank you.
-Yes.
-Mr. Curran for you.
Put him on.
-Hiya, Compton.
-Joe, hold it a minute, will you?
That'll be all, Janine. Thank you.
Joe, I've been meaning to call you.
About tomorrow night, it's....
Well, it looks as if
we're just not gonna be able to make it.
Yeah?
Melissa ran away from the hospital.
She found out what happened.
She found out? How could she find out?
Well, I'll tell you when I see you.
I've been down in the Village every night
trying to find her.
Look, I'll go with you.
I'm falling off my feet.
I was thinkin' about getting to bed early.
No, can't stop lookin'.
You gotta keep lookin'.
It'll be easier if you got company.
I'll go with you.
Okay, I'll meet you
down in the Village around 8:00.
There's a parking lot
at Bowery and East 5th Street.
Okay, I'll see you.
Bye, Joe.
This could be a long night.
That's all right, I been wantin'
to see these animals, where they live.
-Okay.
-Let's go.
It's colder than a witch's tit out.
-Say, mister, you got any spare change?
-No, but I know where there's a spare job.
Dumb honky.
I like that.
That guy, he never got that before.
Used to be,
you had to be 40 or 50 years old...
...before you could
become a bum on the streets.
Look at that shit.
Cowboys and Indians.
Well, they grew up on television.
Hopalong Cassidy at the age of three.
Hopalong Cassidy. Real revolutionaries.
-Let's go in here.
-The Cauldron?
She used to mention this place.
Maybe she'll come in.
-How's that for a half-assed idea?
-All I know is, I need a drink.
There's some room in the back,
but you have to take your shoes off.
Take off your shoes? What is that bullshit?
Well, when in Rome....
What? What do you mean?
You do as the Romans do.
Yeah.
He looks like a truck driver.
What's that word they got?
"Groovin'?" "Groovy?"
If they're not screwin', they're groovin'.
Screwin' and groovin'.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Would you like to order?
-Got Imperial?
-Sorry, we don't serve alcohol here.
You don't serve alcohol here?
Well, what do you serve?
We serve shrimp tempura kakiage,
miso soup....
That's Jap food.
Not really. It's macrobiotic.
It's food in accordance
with the order of the universe.
Looks a little bit like Susie.
No, her eyes are different.
Doesn't look a thing like Susie.
At least they still got booze.
Come on, kids.
Melissa Compton, she's about 5'8",
about 20 years old...
...auburn hair.
Melissa Compton.
-No, mister.
-Why don't you get a haircut?
Joe, take it easy.
No, can't say that I see this one.
Why don't you put it up on bulletin board
behind you with note? Here is paper.
-You have pencil?
-Yes, thank you.
-Maybe she come in and see.
-Yes, maybe she will.
That stuff they got at Niagara Falls,
the Empire State Building...
...pennants, pens, gimmicks.
I tell Mary Lou not to buy that stuff.
It's junk. She buys it anyway.
This stuff, what's the difference?
Junk is junk, right?
All I know is these fucking kids
are getting' more than we ever did.
Look at that.
The President of the United States:
If you can't buy a used car from him
who can you buy a used car from?
Guys, I'm gonna split.
See you up there later?
-Sure, we'll see you there.
-Great, peace.
-Let's get something to eat.
-At least it's warm here.
-It's pretty hopeless, isn't it?
-What?
-I said, it's hopeless.
-Oh, yeah.
Yeah, you gotta hang in there,
know what I mean? You can't give up.
The truck driver digs you.
Obviously, he's got good taste.
You want to turn a trick?
That's lovely, a hippie pimp?
I'm gonna put those guys on.
You guys lookin' for some grass, maybe?
I got all I need, sonny.
You kiddin'? You really have some?
From the junkie,
still have it in the trunk of my car.
You know what that guy said?
I said, "You guys lookin' for some grass?"
You yo-yo,
they could be narcs or somethin'.
They ain't narcs.
I know narcs. Narcs have long hair.
I thought we could
lay some oregano on them.
They wouldn't know the difference.
So the old guy says,
"I've got all I need, sonny."
Suppose he's serious?
Guys like that? They wouldn't have grass.
Nobody's got grass.
Sure.
Man, you puttin' me on?
You really got some grass?
Yeah, that's what I said.
Well, we're having a little party.
We could all smoke some,
at one of the chicks' pads.
No, thanks.
Be pretty groovy, if you know what I mean.
I know what you mean.
-That's not such a bad idea.
-What?
Well, we're not getting' no place this way.
This way, we get to know the kids.
You know, we get friendly,
we infiltrate them, you know what I mean?
Then maybe they'll tell us something
about your daughter. Just see.
You don't have to smoke the stuff.
Well, maybe you're right.
-What have I got to lose?
-What?
What have I got to lose?
Well, then, let's go to the party.
Far fuckin' out!
The grass famine is finally over!
This is fantastic.
You got the record on pretty fuckin' loud.
Sorry, do you want me to turn it down?
Yeah.
You know I read in Mechanics Illustrated
that sound can hurt your ears.
Yeah, I wouldn't wanna do that.
Acid, grass, look at this chunk of hash.
Coke, speed, psilocybin.
-Am I gonna trip.
-You're in the business?
No, his mother is a junkie.
Solid.
Mary Lou ought to see this place.
They got some great decoratin' ideas.
Far out.
If you could fit it into all your openings:
your nose, your eyes, your ears....
It's a great fucking drug.
We fucked for hours.
Yeah. Definitely.
It's like a dream, you know?
It's like a drug head's dream.
-Come on, dance.
-I can't.
Yes, you can, you just do anything,
anything at all. Come on.
Think of this part
as the center of your body.
Just move it from the hips out.
You mean, that's where I feel the music,
down there?
Right, that's it, you're getting it.
From the balls out.
From the balls out, right?
Groovy, that's where it's at.
-Here.
-No, thanks.
What's the matter? It won't kill you.
Chicken?
What you do is suck in deep,
and then hold it until it hurts.
You don't need to tell me.
I seen it on TV all the time.
I better sit down here, you know,
in case I get drunk...
...or it hits me all of a sudden.
I gotta sit down.
It's no good, it's panda piss.
Come on. Get with the Pepsi generation.
-You're kidding.
-No. Chicken?
-What do you mean, chicken?
-Chickie, chickie.
You think I'm chicken?
All right.
You think I'm chicken, huh?
You think I don't know how.
You watch this.
You still think I'm chicken?
All right, my friend.
I don't feel any different.
-Free yourself.
-Free yourself.
I lived all my life,
I ain't never been to an orgy.
This is an orgy, isn't it?
Yes, it seems to fit the definition.
Fuckin' A.
They're touching.
The new sex, like eating.
Screwin' like that,
you can't be very important.
Well, what you lose in importance...
...you make up in frequency.
How do they fall in love?
It was better for you than for me.
-Thanks a lot.
-Can I have the dope?
Why don't you give the old guys a break?
It's not a bad idea.
I hope I'm not out of line.
If you want it that bad, man,
you can have it.
Well, take off your clothes.
I don't have to take my clothes off.
I can make it without takin' off my clothes.
If you want to make it with me,
take off your clothes.
Where we gonna do it? Here?
I mean, you got another bed
in another room?
You do have another bed in another room?
Your friend's pretty uptight, isn't he?
Mirrors. Watching ourselves
was as far as my generation ever got.
You mean you never got into whips
or anything?
-Socks, too.
-Socks, too?
She's anti-fetish.
You want me?
Why not?
You mean...
...What the World Needs Now,
and all that sort of thing?
Something like that.
You just beat the world speed record.
Whose?
Making love, you know,
isn't the same thing as a 50-yard dash.
Well, what do you mean by that?
How ya doin'?
Never screwed on grass before?
That was....
Outrageous?
Outrageous.
Out. Way out.
-Can I join you two?
-He's all yours.
Fair enough.
I'll buy that.
-No preliminaries?
-I don't need no preliminaries.
-Get your clothes on.
-I'm not going anywhere.
-We're cuttin' out with this bag of goodies.
-That's a dirty trick.
Why should those pricks have it?
I mean Ronnie and Gail,
leaving them here with those guys.
They're big girls,
they can take care of themselves.
I want to see you again.
I wanna get together again.
No.
No?
You liked it. I could tell you liked it.
Didn't you like it?
It was okay.
-So I'll see you again.
-No.
Listen, when something happens once,
it doesn't mean it has to happen again.
Then that's just a one-night stand.
Come on,
you've had one-night stands before.
Yeah, but I decided.
Wait a minute.
No, man, no. That's too much.
Just the credit cards, man.
-You're askin' for the pigs.
-Sell 'em.
What about a weekend?
Maybe, but I don't really think so.
Is that your way of saying no?
I guess so.
Compton! Christ!
-Little pricks stole our wallets.
-Our wallets?
Yeah, the drugs, too. I'm gonna get 'em.
Get your pants on.
Where are they? Where'd your friends go?
Come on. I said, "Where are they?"
Come on, where'd they go, bitch?
Tell me, come on, where did they go?
You're gonna tell me, or I'm gonna
beat the shit out of you, come on!
Look, we don't know.
The hell you don't.
Come on, bitch, come on, whore.
Come on, talk.
Will you stop him?
What are you protecting them for?
They didn't give a damn about you.
Come on, bitch, want me to hurt you now?
They've got a commune in the country.
-Where is it?
-I don't know.
Tell me!
Up Route 9, take it to the18...
...about 5 miles on Edgewood Road.
-If you're lying, I'll be back.
-I'm not lying.
I can finish what I started. Got that?
You just balled me, you don't believe me?
Wait a minute, Compton.
Joe, put them back.
Just give 'em a little scare.
-No.
-Shake 'em up.
-Maybe you wanna give us back our stuff?
-Yeah, sure.
You got it all?
Where's the money?
Oh, my God.
What the hell you doin', Compton?
God, no, don't shoot me. I won't tell.
Don't shoot me. Please don't shoot me.
Please. I won't tell.
What are you gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?
-I won't tell anybody. Please.
-Where's that gonna get you?
You wanna shoot somebody, shoot them.
Please, don't.
There's only one way out now: clean.
That means everybody.
-At this point, it can get to be fun.
-No more.
I don't get you, Compton.
You hate those kids.
You hate the way those girls
put you down...
...the way those kids,
those little shitheads...
...they made a shithead out of you,
guys like Frank...
...what Frank did to your daughter.
No!
Look, Compton, you told me
you got a kick out of killing Frank.
These kids, they shit on you,
they shit on your life.
They shit on everything you believe in.
They shit on everything!
You hate 'em as much as I do.
No!
It's your ass now, Compton!
These kids, they shit on you,
shit on your life.
They shit on everything you believe in,
on everything.
You wanna shoot somebody, shoot them.
Are you gonna kill me, too?
Melissa!
