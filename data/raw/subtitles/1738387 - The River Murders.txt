Jack,They just found Sarah's body
Richards along the river in Hillside Park.

The one that work in DA office?
I talked to John Langley will,
but I knew you'd want to find out.
I got to do this.
- Did you like Sarah, right?
- Years ago.
I saw the other day in courthouse.
She asked about you.
You seem to have lasting effect
on the women you know.
we were married a couple of years and
had two kids. That horrible.
Look like she was sexually assaulted.
We found her clothing down below in the hollow.
You Find the clothes down there.
- Yes.
He broke his neck.
Got be  a strong man
she was in good shape.
Sarah was married ? Wasnot she ?
wedding ring is missing !
What is it Jack?
Almost 12 years ago I dated Sarah for 4 months
The last time
we had sex was down there.
- That makes me a suspect.
- Yes.
We got do this by the book Jack.
You 2 go to the station and make
a statement. Do You want a lawyer?
Come on, fuck you.
See you two at the station.
Excuse me I'll stay a night at the Downway.
How do I get faster to the highway?
Go 5 blocks there.
But be careful out there,
there is too much rain .
Yes. 40 days and 40 nights.
Can I get you anything?
No thanks.
Ok Take care .
The coroner put the time between
death between 6am and 9am.
I was here at 8am and
was sleeping before that.
Was Ana there?
No, he had to go to work at 5 am.
Jack, this is...
... a hard for me, but
I got to put you under adminstartive relieve...
... until we
clear you.
I need your badge and your gun.
Now I will go home , I hope you clear this in the morning.
Jack I need you
to stay away away from this case.
What happens?
-It is  Nothing.
- Tell me.
I tell you in the morning.
As the body was
in the same area...
This is just too crazy
this can not be really happening.
But it is. Sorry.
Honey , I need to tell you something.
What? It was at least a year before
you and I knew.
No Jack that is not it.
What?
Just Nothing. No.
I  go to  go to  fish market.
- You okay?
- Yes.
I have to go running. I love you.
They always return to the scene of the crime.
Do not cross the tape line .
You need to check for enemies that she made at DA (district attorney).
I  called over there and they will send you a
list of convictions from the last 3 years.
What you got here , anything?
We should not  tell you this, but the
coroner called, found the ring.
You can be the expert witness .
They found it inside her Pussy , jack.
One area that we heard
you knew very well.
Honey ,Where have you been?
What wrong? I was running.
How do you say this?
I got home and...
... there was a message from your father.
There has been an accident Jack.
Is your mom. She's dead.
She walked across that bridge every
day for 30 years.
She Usually got up at 6am.
I was in the workshop until 10pm.
I always in such a hurry.
I always say she must be  more
careful but never listens to me.
She wouldnot listnen to anyone, Dad.
- Thanks, baby.
- you are welcomed.
Too much rain.
The river will overrun its banks.
I talked to the people in her division,
I called his supervisor and he said...
... she was out for a few days
so maybe there was a threat.
I saw and talked to the husband
he is cleared such he has been sick .
There is nothing else new except that the FBI
called to find something on her PC.
- were there prints?
- No prints.
Jack, you need to
concentrate on your father.
We all be at the funeral.
- Call me if anything comes up.
- I will do.
The father is here, it's time, baby.
My old mother, God bless her
soul died giving me birth.
I never knew her though
somehow she lives on within me.
And Often I hear her speak .
In the rain and wind.
The soul is a force
to be reckon with.
Often you will not die , you will refuse
It will continue on within all of us.
The FBI says that if the ring serves
several people more secure.
The ring placement fits her profile.
So that I
discarded as a suspect.
But not connected
I have no problems.
There was one in Reno and one in Sacramento.
The FBI will be in our office tomorrow.
The officer in charge is a
idiot. Son of Quantico.
I've been 6 years in the law enforcement
and I never had case like this.
Do not get too excited  Jack.
If this is a serial murderer
, they have jurisdiction.
As for as I am concerned
This new information clears you right way .
Who is he? He looks like FBI , this guy.
He is technician from the lab. They want
to take a DNA swap from you.
Now? At my mother 's funeral?
I know you're right,
but please Jack do it .
I clear you officially soon
and I need you in this case.
You can do it by the van.
- Finally fell asleep.
- Good.
You do not have to do that,
baby. Leave it for tomorrow.
I've never left a dish
dirty in the sink overnight.
I am not about to start now. Have a drink.
- Want one?
- No, I'm fine.
He'll be alright.
He is already talking about working tomorrow.
I just can not imagine him alone in this house.
He has never wash a dish in his entire life.
Maybe we should move here.
No.
I cannot quiet see you playing local sheriff Jack.
It is not your thing.
Who is this?
Jack I am sorry It is late.
Okay,Come on in . Honey is Tony Ragusa.
I am very Sorry about your mom
and I could not come today.
Come in, it is raining.
I got a police bussines and I
am afraid it is not very pleasant.
- We need to talk.
- What is it?
Ellie Nelson.
We found her body
in  the river, naked.
It seems to have been there for 2 or 3 days.
Honey What is the matter?
I had this note with her.
Samaria '' will be found guilty. by
that was rebelled against her God. .'' Signed by Elijah
- Were she wearing a wedding ring?
- I do not know.
I need to see the body.
- Call the coroner.
- What is it?
Call the fucking coroner.
Jesus, Jack!
- Are you sure?
- Yes.
I'm sure, Jack.
I'm so sorry, Ellie.
I am sorry about what i said.
Donot wory I understand.
God , What kind of crazy bastard would do something like that?
This makes me sick.
Always something to fix around here.
Dad You and mama never wear wedding ring?
We never saw the need.
Do you have them?
Sure she got jewelery in the
bottom drawer of the bureau.
I should have buried it with her.
Jack!
I got to go back, the FBI has a list
there are other victims in other states.
Oh My God , Jesus Jack!
Could not be just a coincidence , just two killings?
No, the killer has
very distinct signature.
It is very graphic.
They were killed by the same person Ana.
- Your mother.
- No, I'm sure about that .
So What do you mean by this?
Ana,What it means that
you got to carry a gun.
- This...
- Get out of here.
I will arrange some help for your fatherand get back afternoon
but I am not going to carry a gun with me.  No!
It seem  we have so much in common ...
... nice to see you again.
Sorry, I do not think so.
It was really nice to meet you.
I just do not think we really have a connection.
Take care...
- Leonard.
- Right.
- Are you Sung Li ?
- Yes Can I help you?
You have been highly recommended.
I am Sorry, I no longer give massages.
But we have...
many pretty girls...
here to serve.
I prefer mature women.
I am now the owner.
If you would like  to make an appointment I can arrange
for a mature woman to assist you.
No.
Thanks.
I understand, is that...
You have come so highly recommended.
Father I have not give massage for many years

- Body, was discovered Yesterday .
Jack, you fucked this girl
by the river 30 years ago.
Yes.
And Sarah Richards, you
fucked her in the park 12 years ago.
Agent Clover

Always yours.
While we appreciate FBI humor
why not get to the point?
Jack are married.
- Kids?
- No. No kids. I have beed married for 8 years.
I'm not married myself never have been.
Alma here , she has been married
15 years tell them what your husband do.

- Great
Fixes my old TV
for free. It's a bargain.
Would you say that these
happily married, Jack.?
Yes. very.
As has been married for a while
you do not have much sex.
Sometimes you might
look up old girlfriends to see what they have been up to.
Agent Vukovitch:  why you donot get to the point
and cut this bullshit out?
Jack is the best detective
that I ever worked with.
He has closed more cases than anyone
in the city so please...
... stop wasting our time.
I had no idea I was in the presence
of  greatness.
we got two names on the list here.
If you are familiar
with these two photos,
We may have a
very strange situation here.
This is Mary Barnes, went
to college with her.
This was long ago I...
Laura.
Laura...
McCoy.
Just for the record Have you recently gone
to Reno or Sacramento?
No.
That is Too bad, I would
facilitated the work.
Did you have sexual  relation
with these two women?
Are you familiar with loactions
where the bodies were found?
Any connection between them?
Can you Draw line between them
No .... No
No obvious connection.
This is very exciting how
many women have you been with?
More than you.
Look Jack every women you have ever been  with
is at risk.
I may be an asshole but you gonna
to answer everyone of  my questions.
We need full and complete list.
For every women
I've been slept with?
Kiss,filrt up , finger, whatever.
Is it a problem?
This is the first time
left a note.
Elijah, Samaria, it seems biblical.
I will Check with the father Harlam.
Please, no!
God forgive you, little girl.
He has a plan for you.
As it has a plan for me.
You need an army.
And I'll lead it
No pain.
Listen father.
I need to be re instated ,It is obvious that there is no connection
between me and any of these murders .
Not until DNA comes back
- That  take a few days.
- So I still suspect?
That's all We got.
Why do not you show Jack the list.
to see if he can circle off few more names?
This is list of all  the unresolved female
murder came us across the country in past year.
We got 4 victims. Violent Sexual
assault , suffocate , necks broken.
Bruises and ligature marks
indicate torture before death.
The bodies have been positioned.
Also the Acrylic fibers and rubber resides
he just transport the victims
Who were dead and alive in the trunk of his car.
The killer leaves two very distinct signatures .
The wedding ring is placed
Inside the vagina. and  post mortem
small incisions  were cross you miss
With razor like instrument carved in
the toungue of victim in the shape of cross.
So It's obvious that a strong man able
to control these women  easily.
Psychological problems.
Most likely bed wetter trouble childhood
problematic. He killed the neighbor's cat.
There are two more.
Maria Duarte, in Las Vegas.
Sharleen Bell, San Quin.
Both raped, necks broken.
Duarte had an earring placed inside her
vagina and  Sharleen wall crucifixed.
Who would you talk about these stuffs?
I donot tell anybody ant this stuff.
Does anyone know about your sexual adventures?
A psychiatrist, a priest, your wife.
No one.
Let me ask you one more question.
Did you fuck your mother?
Jack!
Enough, Jack.!
Just , Fucking donot.
Alright It is lunch?
- Tell me how many.
- I've never counted.
They are propably close to 100.
- This is perfect.
- surely.
How many men have you slept with?
- 3.
- I imagine that.
Go home. Make a list.
Think about it, Meditate.
we are not in rush here,
We have a lot of time.
We need contacts,
e- mail, telephones.
One more thing.
We'll have to exume
your mother body.
Elijah was a prophet in
the Old Testament but
This quote is not it.
but the Josaia free.
A prophet is like a saint.
Not exactly.
In the biblical sense It is a man
called by God to be his spkesman,  messenger.
A prophet communicates with
the Lord through visions , exctasy.
Often they are thought to be insane.
They deliver God  prophecies  through
written word, sermons,
symbolic acts.
You are Not supposed to be here Jack.
Go on father.
Here's the book Josaia,
Chapter 13, verse 16.
Samaria '' '' That is the ancient Israel.
It will be held guilty for ''she have
they rebelled against their God.''
They shall fall by the sword ''. the
little one shall be dashed in pieces.''
And the pregnant women  ''
shall be ripped open.''
Is this young woman pregnant?
No, but her wedding ring was taken from
finger and placed in her vagina.
What is the context of that quote?
It is rather a gruesome prophecy.
It is a curse by
God on the nation.
For their sins against his will he
would close the nation wounds .
This is the Bible.
The Bible is about
both good and evil.
What you described is
desecration of the body.
It is evil.
By the book, Otherwise
it will just cause troubles.
let me take off the case
I am not staying home women
are dying because of me.
I am  at stake here.
- How is  Ana?
- A patrol monitors.
- I mean How is she holding up?
- she is not happy.
I'll drive you home to your dad.
- But you said you were safe.
- Some things are not wise.
This is unbelievable.
"Tr . anslated By Dr. Ahmed .Hakim"
This can not be happening.
Look I need you to take some time off.
few weeks at least. You'll be safe at home.
you do not tell me what to do.
I will not not lock myself away. I have a
job here ,  responsibilities. ( vcie president !)
Ana, you are in danger. this is
serious,  people  are dying.
I am not taking time off, Jack.
And you cannot change my mind.
Anyway,  I have noticed
that , they are  watching me.
This is crazy.
If you notice anything strange. anybody
that seem out the ordinary to you.
-you  make sure you call it.
- Of course.
They will be watching you.
- Will you be back tonight?
- Yah I will be back around 12.
I can not tell my
Dad on the phone.
- What will you gone to tell him?
- The truth.
Bye, honey.
Do me a favor, do not
put me on the list.
I would not do that.
She knows. women
have a sense.
- Jenny that was a long time.
- Believe me, she knows.
I thought you wanted me to
go by the book.
Cut the shit Jack, I can take care of myself.
Close to a 100 really?
And what about you?
How many for you ?
I do not know, maybe 20.
None past year,
but who's counting.
I did not marry until I was 40.
I guess I dated alot
never seemed strange to me.
- Are you still doing the wives?
- No.
The changed it to white cotton panties.
He was always very
proud of you and me...
... you know how I feel.
I've been a cop dad for 28 years.
I donot have to like it.
- Does Ana know about all of this?
- Yes.
She walked across that bridge
every day for 30 years.
It doesnot make sense  for me that she just falled.
Tomorrow we will know more, we will draw
and learn in one day.
It's a nice spot we have got there.
I drove up Yesterday  .
White roses are blooming.
It's not descent to disturb her
I love seeing a grandson.

The other victims...
... it was only  one night thing.
I  literally know her for one night.
We got drunk. nobody
could have known. Nobody.
The answer is right in front of you.
I wish it was that easy.
This girl you met her in
the party about 5 years ago.
She was wearing a black dress.
you Talked to her at least 5 
  min before you introduce me .
Her name was Leslie.
Leslie Tail.
I knew you had
slept with her. I knew it.
Women know.
We can tell.
Ask the women on your list.
That is what the killer is doing.
Her name is Sung Li  .
She work at the massage
 of that is in the 3rd.
I followed him once.
Stop, please.
Why are you doing this?
For my brothers and sisters.
They are innocent souls.
I have two little children.
You should not fear the work of God.
Now you mark it.
So when you come
the kingdom of heaven;
Lord knows...
...That  I have sent you home.
You will born again.
As one of the Christ 
devine soldiers

Something I have heard.
Something embarrassing.
Excuse would you mind?

women on this list.
Concentrate on these in the top
You'll be thrilled to hear from me Jack.
Why?
If you're right and this guy extract other 
names and locations from the victims .
Then at least it derrange logic to it.
Ya ,  Ellie Nelson , she definitely knows Charleen .
Sarah Richardson , she would know Sung Lie
because that was around the same time 
Not exactly 100 years ago
 Overestimated your charm?
no I only overestimaed my memory
I have got 12 men working
 and entire task force .
I can do nothing unless
u get me all the information.
- I am trying.
- Try harder.
Are you busy for dinner tonight?
Eat me.
- may be for desserts.
- knock it off.
I spent the morning with
Josaia book. Interesting.
Israel is portrayed
as an unfaithful pride.
The country is welthy, successful but lost
its moral compass , its faith in God.
It Calls for the divine vengeance.
Only then will  be there salvation.
 30 years you are doing nothingbut hanging
 around hundred wome why the change?
Because I fell in love.
I see there is not one women on 
this list since you have ben married
- What is your point?
- Have you been faithful?
With all these hundreds of women I am sure you 
messed up at least one happy jealous husband or two.
It is very possible.
Circle all the names of those
were married when you met.
What are you doing you and 
what about your task force?
There have been 6 murders, I have
got 2 agents working each one.
We have  interviewed everyone of your
 so called freind back to grade schools

But none of them admits
be a homicidal maniac.
I have got  4 units working overtime
Quantico all  for Jack. Verdon.
Road in the valley of the
shadows. I will fear no evil.
Give me strength to face my
enemies. Let me not into temptation
And deliver them from evil. Amen.

- I can not, Annie.
C'mon, for old times sake.
Listen, you may be in danger.
The FBI will contact you.
I'm surprised you have not done it.
Inside and shut the door and not
talk to anyone you meet.
What's it all about?
Tomorrow I'll call and I'll explain everything.
- Please.
- Okay.
Come on.
- It was good to see you, Annie.
- Good night.
Find him!
Yes.
Another more.
Damn!
- Tremendous list, Jack.
- You said you did not want to read it.
I did not want, but when you're late
home smelling like cheap perfume, I wonder.
I have to go kill someone else
- Then go.
- I have no time for this.
Fuck you.
What can I say? This is a list
of women with whom I went to bed.
I will not apologize. Is my life.
- That hurts me.
- I have to go.
I told you. If you want to talk about this
we will, but now I can not.
I do not want, I told you I'm not interested.
- It seems you do not understand.
- Understand that?
Make your own list and we'll see.
How many times have you slept
with each of these women?
- At what point?
- I think you like...
... bed one night.
Before meeting
perhaps I was 12 relationships.
I slept with them many
Sometimes, perhaps hundreds of times.
How many times have we slept?
I do not know.
Take the account. I
I fucked more than you.
I like to fuck, Jack.
I am a sexual person.
- And this list is not complete.
- What do you mean?
You know.
And to whom I refer.
Are you Jack. Verdon?
Yes, I'm Jack. Verdon.
- Do you know who I am?
- No. Who?
Sarah Richards was my wife.
The detective told me Sotor
who died because of you.
An animal that raped and
murdered because of you.
Is it true?
My children will grow up without their mother.
You know what it is to grow up without parents?
Look me in the face.
Quiet, drops the gun!
I have it.
I remember you. Sorry, a lot.
Fuck!
Jack, the dog.
Fuck, Sotor.
The husband of Sarah Richards
tried to shoot me because of you.
Why my fault?
Will not you come
by the back door?
I do not care with whom or with which you
slept, we need all the names.
With a man...
... ever.
Do not be ashamed, my
brother is a bit loose.
I do not know who he is.
Do you think our suspect did this?
It is our guy.
The fingers crushed.
No wedding ring.
Not even find out where it is.
Was raped?
I did not look closely, you
leave that job to the coroner.
William Thomas was called Lincoln.
Your wallet is over there.
Perhaps in an orgy?
The notes, fetuses, we
this testing.
You it is challenging to decipher.
We find this under the bed.
Malacai.
Malacai on many issues is the
last chapter of the Old Testament.
Not much is known that, since
not mentioned much in the Bible.
The name means '' Malacai ''
messenger in Hebrew.
I read the book of Josei.
It is allegorical. Josei equivalent
Israel as the unfaithful wife.
God was very angry with Israel.
Here is a quote from Malacai.
'' I will send you Elijah the prophet before the
arrival of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.
And will turn the hearts of
parents against children.
And the hearts of
children against parents.''
It is Elijah again.
It was prophesied to come and
is preparing the road.
What Jizabel?
The pagan queen Simeria.
Elijah had Jízabel
a terrible fight of faith.
And the name Jizabel mean weakness.
A gift. You can read all about it.
Do you think they would recognize
this guy if you saw?
- I met someone at the cafe.
- Does anyone again?
- What are you thinking about Jenny?
- Do you think I have not thought of?
Every man who smiles at me
street makes me a psychopath.
It is a fun way
to live your life.
How to Flame?
John.
I do not know the name.
- What do you do?
- Is a consultant.
Where?
You do not know the name
or where he works.
He asked me to take a
drink with him tonight.
I need you to know.
Come later.
- Do you gather here?
- If you do not mind.
Ask him few questions but not
act like you're my dad.
I just want you to be safe ok?
I want you happy , but I want you safe.
I guess if the guy who slept
hundreds could find her listed.
You'll find someone.
Jack, do not let it slip away ana.
Do not let this
ruin what they have.
Something does not fit here.
The wedding ring.
What do you mean?
And if we are so close that
the symbol is not the ring.
In some other items used victims.
And this is also the sexual aspect.
What if the symbolic act is not
about sex but where you put it?
Puts it in the vagina.
No, in the womb.
Giving birth.
Remember what I said about the father Harlam
that pregnant women will be open?
Yes.
