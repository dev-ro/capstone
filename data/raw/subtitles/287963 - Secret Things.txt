Ok.
My name is Sandrine.
I'm the new one.
As you see, I'm behind the bar.
Sometimes I'm the cloakroom attendant.
I don't like it.
But I have to make a living.
So I just watch the show,
the girls.
I'm only really interested in Nathalie.
She's my secret role model.
She's beautiful.
She can win anybody over.
Actually,
although I don't like to admit it,
I wish I had that ability too.
To make them all drool
and have them at my feet.
If you don't want to fuck him,
you don't.
Girls, I have a club here that does well.
Why?
Because the customer knows
he gets what he wants.
That's what I pay you for.
You, Nathalie, I like you.
You have a cute ass
that attracts many customers.
But you know that I'm...
not affected.
You, Sandrine, you're free.
Nobody tells you what to do.
Except...
the world is the way it is.
It's your choice.
Don't give in to that pig.
Asshole.
Aren't you going home?
I'm three months behind on the rent.
My landlady would kick me out.
And the boss knows that, right?
Damnit.
Come to me then.
This created a true bond
between us.
Do you want to eat?
- No, thanks.
Champagne?
Where do you live?
- In a little attic room in Montmartre.
At first, I was so happy.
It was expensive and small,
but it was all mine.
But after all these evenings on my own...
- Do you live alone?
Didn't you have a boyfriend?
- We broke up straight after.
He was more of a buddy.
Although we did sleep together.
But I hadn't left
my parents
to become a prisoner again.
How was he?
- What do you mean?
In bed.
It was good occasionally.
Just once.
In the car.
He was driving.
My left hand was on my knee.
He let go of the wheel.
took my hand and slowly pushed
it up along my thigh.
And then, still as slowly...
he forced me to caress myself.
That time I felt something.
But the next day
we still broke up.
And you?
Nothing special. I studied ballet.
Graduated.
And ended up in that club.
Can I ask you something?
- Shoot.
It's an indiscrete question.
- Go ahead.
Since I work in that joint, I've...
What does it do to you to dance
naked in front of all those people watching?
Nothing.
You turn them on, don't you?
- Most of the time it's routine.
Most of the time?
Once, I came intensely
on the stage.
More intense than with a man?
That night I had the most
intense orgasm ever.
Why?
- Because everybody was watching me.
Because men were watching you?
- Because everybody was watching me.
It turned me on very much
and I came.
It's happened more often.
So that's it.
What?
- What makes you so seductive.
Did it happen tonight too?
- You can't win them all.
Does it embarrass you what I just said?
- No. I envy you.
I would never have dared.
Dare what?
Show your nudity?
Enjoy turning them on?
Or coming?
All those things.
But I'm not pretty enough.
- That's what us girls all say.
I was afraid that evening too.
The evening you...
- Yes.
I had had some champagne.
Like tonight.
Just enough to feel light...
nice... without being drunk.
And I had the guts.
And I came intensely.
Am I shocking you?
- No.
Like I said, I envy you.
What stops you from doing it too?
- I'd never dare.
Are you drunk?
No.
No, I feel ok.
Let's play a game then.
What kind of game?
- A dare game.
Dare cross that border
in your head
that none of your female friends
will ever cross.
And it will give you pleasure.
I would have preferred to leave.
No.
- Stay, I'm not going to jump you.
It has to happen in your
head first.
Ok.
Now close your eyes.
Let yourself get carried away.
The rest will follow automatically.
Go to the bed.
At the same time, I was thinking:
What's the risk?
You can leave whenever you want.
Well, will you have
the guts?
Get under the sheet.
Undress under the sheet.
Close your eyes.
Let yourself go.
Each time you hesitate.
it takes only a little effort
to go further
and to dare enjoy it.
Softly caress your body.
Try to discover it.
Without any shame.
Softly stroke your skin.
Find the spots
that give you enjoyment.
Softly stroke with your hand over your thigh...
over the inside of your thigh.
Is it good?
Take of your bra.
And your panties.
Start caressing yourself again.
Is it good?
Keep going.
Now remove the sheet.
You're beautiful.
Give in to the enjoyment
of being naked and being watched.
Is it good?
Keep going to the extreme.
Now.
Goodnight.
Where did you sleep?
- I have another room.
How do you feel?
Very good.
I'm here. You're here.
But then there's my landlady.
We'll have to negotiate.
I have to find a new job.
- Do you want to live here?
I can lend you some money
until you're on your feet.
Then you return it.
- That would be great.
It would be fun even.
But I'd be in your way.
You must have friends.
They never visit me at home.
Do you like women.
I'm not a lesbian.
Me neither.
No, it's just...
I'm fed up with being alone
but I don't want a man.
And somehow...
I like you.
Come, move in with me
and we'll find you a job.
Hello, mum.
Hi... And?
Did you move?
Tell me. Here, here.
Don't leave crumbs everywhere.
What's that friend of yours like?
She's nice.
We each have our own room.
And she doesn't ask questions.
I don't have to justify everything I do to her.
Have you got a job? You're not
waitress again at a restaurant?
If you could call it a restaurant.
I'm going to do office work.
Bookkeeper or secretary.
Look me in the eye.
Are you lying?
- No, really.
Come, give me a kiss.
And say hello to your father.
- Where is he?
There, in the garden.
Each morning, he's pacing around,
waiting for a phone call
about a new job.
Poor dad. He could go to the movies
or the theatre with you.
Or just go for a walk together.
I responded to so many ads,
back then.
And talked to so many personnel managers.
But only in small companies.
In the big ones, you don't get past
the subordinates.
In hindsight, Nathalie left me hanging
like that on purpose.
One day we were in the subway.
And we were both fed up.
I think we handled
it wrong.
We were just doing what
everybody did.
Without money or relations,
we're eternal losers.
From now on, we're using
our guts and our bodies to get ahead.
- We won't be the only ones.
Shyness can't slow us down.
We're going further and we'll do more
than all the other girls.
Come on.
Let's show some guts right away.
How?
- You understood.
Discretely take off your bra.
- Here?
Yes.
- Are you mad?
Do it.
In front of everybody?
- Nobody will notice.
Look.
Now you.
Pretend it's perfectly normal.
Put your handbag in your lap
to cover yourself.
Caress yourself.
One guy saw me.
There, on the left.
Keep going.
How does it make you feel?
I'm kind of scared.
It's exciting to be watched.
Show yourself now.
Quickly.
Come!
To stop there
would have been too easy.
But she knew the subway stations
were full of cameras.
Do it now.
I thought you didn't fancy women?
- I want to make you come.
We've been caught.
- Doesn't matter. Go on.
Quick, hurry.
Strange to walk around
naked under our coats
amongst the clueless crowds.
Strange, but very good.
And this is how we continued.
I had developed guts
and that gave me a feeling of superiority
over everybody I met.
Next chapter.
Men, the manual.
First you have to choose a good one.
But don't jump his bones.
Play the innocent girl who still has to
learn everything and who picked him as her protector.
We can all do that. Men want sex
and then the next woman.
That's why you shouldn't fuck them.
Or at least, not necessarily.
You study him and let him talk.
Look for his weak spot and find out what drives him.
Money, cars...
I don't know, dough, work.
Once you know, you flatter him.
Once you've picked the right one,
you succumb.
But not right away. He shouldn't think
you're easy.
But not too slowly either.
He'd get bored.
After three or four dinners
you pull out the big guns.
You give him pleasure and make him think
only he can make you come.
You play the obedient, happy girl.
But not for too long.
In bed, you soon stop the comedy.
He gets peeved off right away
when you don't come anymore.
You drop him and you
cheat on him.
Openly.
With meaningless flings.
Also with a woman, if possible.
That humiliates him. He'll go crazy
and come to you on his knees.
And that always works?
- Almost always.
That's the mystery of human nature.
You get attached to what resists
to you or escapes you.
Who taught you that?
Life.
My mother.
But we were a poor family.
I read a lot too.
I studied, just like you.
And we still ended up
in the same nightclub.
Women lack
self confidence and guts.
We always need somebody to
encourage us.
In a way, we're like proletarians.
My mother said
she'd always stay one
because she was afraid to improve herself.
"Have guts," she always told me.
Human nature
had no secrets for her.
I never came with a man.
- I know.
And that's fine.
- Yes... Well, as a manner of speech.
Yes, really. You'll soon understand.
What did you do with your boyfriend?
I faked it.
- Why?
Because I wanted to please him.
No. You felt guilty because
you thought it was you.
Wrong.
Third lesson: A femme fatale
tends to be narcissistic or lesbian
and frigid with men.
They only come when they feel like it,
which is not often. That's their power.
With the famous courtesans...
- You want to turn me into a classy whore.
No, I'm explaining life to you.
As I said,
with the famous courtesans
every man hopes to succeed
where all the others failed.
Out of pride, they're prepared
to pay fortunes
to smugly parade next to them.
A bit of frigidity with men performs miracles.
You quickly become addicted to the weapon of sex.
And you should leave being
a slave to others.
You can now come on your own.
You're free. Understand?
And what about love?
- That's our biggest enemy.
The real risk of the trade. During war,
if you start to think, you're dead.
When you fall in love, you're fucked.
Was your life a dream so far?
You have no choice if you want to escape.
Nobody will help you.
That big love
can come later.
Now show me how you faked it.
Did you do that with your boyfriend?
What did you do on stage?
- I faked my real orgasms.
Ok, one more time.
And, did I come or not?
Why, was that fake?
- Yes.
Well, sort of.
- That's good.
It's really difficult to fake it
when you don't feel like it at all.
There are only offices here.
You don't want me to work there, do you?
- Yes, I do.
Is that why I'm wearing
these bourgeois clothes?
No, I won't do it.
I can't.
It reminds me of my father.
We're beautiful. We can try our luck in fashion
or showbiz. Or the movies.
In those scenes, girls are picked up
and thrown down again by the dozens.
Remember our nightclub.
There's less competition in offices.
And you mentioned your father.
I bet work was his life.
And he worked for ungrateful people too.
But he must have had fantasies.
Forget he's your father.
See him like anybody else.
Do you think he had fantasies?
- Like anybody.
And did he pursue them with your mother?
Believe me, he didn't pursue them
with anybody.
Dirty magazines, porn movies,
maybe a whore.
But always in secret and in shame.
Am I wrong?
A nerdy loser who never lived
would be an easy prey, yes.
Now think of men like him
but much higher on the social ladder.
They'll be our victims.
Good morning, ladies.
Are you here for the ad?
Sit down. You'll be called.
This is when Nathalie really surprised me.
That man was the personnel manager.
I didn't think he had looked at anybody
during those few seconds.
I don't know how she did it,
by crossing her legs or opening them...
she didn't exactly
flash her breasts...
Nor her legs.
The look in her eyes, maybe?
- Miss?
Me?
- Come please.
You too, miss.
We were both hired.
I was hired at Statistics,
a department where everybody did calculations.
Well, I wasn't that good with numbers.
So, I was only a secretary
and a hostess. A maid, so to speak.
But Nathalie
became personal assistant
of the Human Resources Manager
as that's called these days.
And in the main office too.
She worked at the Champs Elysées.
I envied her a bit.
You work here at central office SM.
That stands for Stock Management.
We're the brain of the company.
Everybody here is your colleague. They're
each responsible for a range of products.
And there behind his desk
is Mr. Cadène, your superior.
With him is Mr. Delacroix.
In the Barnay Group,
two men are important: Mr. Delacroix
and Barnay senior, but he's 65.
He's very ill.
We rarely see him anymore.
Mr. Delacroix is really in charge.
He's very friendly, you'll see.
Sometimes a bit absent minded.
But authority isn't always easy.
And he?
That's Barnay Jr.,
our General Director.
His first name's Christophe.
We don't see him in the office often.
But for less serious reasons
than his father.
A man with charm,
but dangerous.
Sir... I'd like to introduce
the new girl.
Good morning, miss.
No, stay seated.
I hope you'll like it here.
This is the most important
department of the company.
And the most interesting one.
If you work well,
you can expect a lot.
You'll be one of the rare women
between 35 men.
Don't let them pamper you too much.
Good luck, miss.
See you later.
If you can stay a bit longer this evening...
Don't worry,
just to get to know each other.
Excuse me.
And? Do you like it here?
What do you find the most interesting?
- It's too early to say.
Actually, I'd like to do
as much as possible.
Get to know everything about the company.
You see, I recently experienced
a big disappointment.
In matters of love?
I'm not over it yet
and I'd like to forget it.
By burying myself in work.
I don't want to go home early
and I'd like to work overtime.
Work.
Even after everybody has gone home
and the offices are deserted.
- But...
Do you live on your own?
Sorry, I'm indiscrete.
No, with a friend.
I'll try to take care of it.
The overtime, I mean.
Do you know about IT?
- Only from school.
I only did high school.
The company computer is being
upgraded completely.
All data have to be
entered again.
I can get you involved with that.
Fine. Thank you.
Sorry, I didn't know it was this late.
- No problem.
On the contrary.
See you tomorrow.
- You're not going home through that rain, I hope?
Will you wait with me in the pub?
No, thank you.
- Then I'll take you to the subway.
No, that's ok.
Thank you.
Beautiful, a broken heart.
What was the name of the guy?
- Cadène.
Robert Cadène?
- Yes.
I have information about everybody.
Telephone, health, address.
Even confidential stuff.
- Secrets?
Cadène, 35. Studied commerce.
Lives in the 20th arrondissement.
Apolitical. Comment:
Sound, professionally efficient.
Got preferential treatment from the company, so they
could get a grip on him. Looks for an attractive woman
to receive guests in the weekend.
No. The only really important man
is Barnay Jr.
When the old man dies, he becomes
the boss of the company
and of all of his father's empire.
Unfortunately, I know nothing about him,
except the company gossip.
Or wait, he has a sister.
- Why isn't he married?
Loves women too much.
- Quite a challenge for us.
What do you mean?
He's dangerous and wild.
Almost impossible to tame.
We have to be careful with him.
But under him, there's Delacroix.
49, married for 22 years.
Two children, 16 and 18.
Plays tennis every Tuesday night.
Lives for his work and family.
More for his work, actually.
Beautiful apartment in Neuilly.
Never had an affair.
The ideal target.
For now, keep sucking up to Cadène.
He can prove useful later on.
But Delacroix will be
our first target.
Every Saturday he has lunch
with his mother, after leaving the office.
Hello, how's it going?
Shall I bring a coffee?
- No, thank you.
A glass of water?
- No, thanks.
A juice then?
- No, that's ok.
Shall we have a drink together, tonight?
No, thank you.
See you later then.
- See you later.
Do you have the Port Cergy model?
I can't find it.
Everything has been blocked until tomorrow.
- Damn.
All we can do, is
wait until tomorrow.
Miss, please pass me the
invoices of Mrs. Castaldi,
Mr. Guédiguian,
of Sacif and Societep.
Thank you.
You should promote her.
Who?
- That new girl. Sandrine.
She's serious and works hard.
And she's always friendly.
And the high number?
- Here.
My bag!
Mommy!
What is it? Did you hurt yourself?
Did you fall?
It's nothing.
It's nothing. Better thank the lady.
- Thank you... But...
You're the girl from the office.
- And you're Mr. Delacroix.
What a coincidence.
Thank you.
What happened?
A boy wanted to take your mother's
bag. I was able to prevent it.
Do you live near here?
- Not at all. Quite a coincidence.
Well, goodbye then.
Don't let her go like that.
- Don't get upset.
Miss!
What can I do to thank you?
- Nothing.
Thank you.
Ok... And now... here.
No, you start here.
Is Sandrine there?
- Yes.
Yes?
- Mr. Delacroix wants a word with you.
Right now?
- Yes, right now.
Mr. Delacroix.
Sandrine...
Hello, miss.
Sit down.
Ok.
Miss...
my secretary's swamped in work.
We're creating a new job
to help her. I was thinking of you.
You'll get paid more and, in the long run,
the work will be more interesting.
You have no reply to that?
Can I ask you an honest question?
- Yes, of course.
Are you suggesting this because of the
incident with your mother?
Yes. I mean... no.
I don't want a reward for
doing that. Really.
I'd like a better job the day
you think I'm suitable for it
because of my work.
Everybody here is very content with you.
You don't blame me, do you?
- No.
Can I go now?
- But of course.
Maybe I exaggerated a bit.
Don't eat that one.
Take this one. Look.
There's nothing in it.
- That's why.
Oh, you eat that?
- Just chew.
There you are.
I feel good with you.
Me too.
Really very good.
Are you angry?
I'm sorry.
Is your last experience still bothering you?
I had completely forgotten
about my broken heart.
You should tell me about it.
- Tell you what?
It's good to talk about it.
It's a relief.
- I can't really forget it yet.
It only started to get better after 2 years.
I was lucky to have my job,
the office, the nice people.
That's why I refused the promotion.
I'm falling in love with you.
It's too early.
Maybe later.
At least accept it, please.
Accept your promotion.
I'll ask them to forget
about your refusal.
Do you promise to accept?
Ok.
Thanks.
- For what?
The movie, the restaurant.
Everything.
I envy the man you'll marry.
Who was that?
- You scared me.
Who was it?
- Who do you mean?
Cut it out.
Was it your department manager?
Or the man of your heart?
You're mean.
You never say anything,
just like the men.
I tell you everything, you know everything
about me, but I know nothing about you.
Come on, I'm not a jealous guy.
I'm superstitious.
- So not your department manager.
The man of your heart.
You don't confide in anybody.
I'm hiding him, because it's serious.
I want to be sure he's for me.
Oh dear, a schoolgirl.
But she did have guts.
She's really hiding him
because she was afraid of me.
But I would never have
stolen her guy from her.
Besides, she was taking me for a ride.
Her big lesson about love
as the big enemy
applied to others,
but not to herself.
Miss Sandrine Tessier?
- Yes.
I'm the secretary of Mr. Barnay Jr.
You're expected by the Board.
Right now?
- Yes.
I'll be right there.
Nathalie?
I've hit the jackpot.
You didn't sleep with Barnay Jr., did you?
- No, they want to see me.
Keep your head cool.
Don't blow it.
He tries to get girls
so he can hurt them later.
Come in.
Damn, he's handsome.
For a moment I even forgot why I was there.
I came closer,
not because I had to,
but to see him from up close.
And he turned out even more handsome.
- Sit down.
Let me see the white raven.
White raven?
- You, miss.
What do you mean?
I'm going to give you an order.
To become the second secretary
of Mr. Delacroix.
Soon private secretary.
Don't speak. I'm ordering you.
And you can't leave the Barnay company.
- Why would I do that?
In case you thought you didn't earn
the job I'm ordering you to accept,
by your own work.
Miss Tessier, the company can't do
without a precious element like you.
A young woman
who gives her heart and soul
to work and overtime.
Denies herself a personal life,
hired for her arithmetic skills.
Although you're mainly a secretary.
You see, miss, these days...
someone with your merit
and morals
is a beautiful and rare find.
One wonders why, by the way.
We see the proof every day:
merit...
that's the only thing that counts.
I'm the living proof.
I congratulate you on your promotion.
See you soon, miss.
Your character intrigues me.
My character?
- Your personality, I mean.
Everybody really appreciates you.
Mr. Delacroix is a remarkable man.
And well positioned.
- What do you mean?
That you're very interesting to...
the company and myself.
You can go now.
Hello.
- Hello, Sandrine.
You look a bit pale.
You haven't refused again, have you?
Mrs. Mercier, please get a
bottle of champagne.
I announce to you the promotion
of Sandrine.
She'll be my second secretary.
You've served me with dedication for 15 years.
You deserve some help.
But I can handle fine.
- Really, you'll be a lot happier.
Sit down.
One month later, Nathalie had secured
her pre-pension.
Are you listening?
Hello. Everything ok?
I've got 2 tickets for Madonna tomorrow.
That's not possible.
We're working until 10 o'clock at least.
You do have time for a drink, don't you?
- Too much work.
Honestly, are you avoiding me?
You haven't wanted to see me for weeks.
- I'm seeing you now.
You know what I mean.
- I'm really busy.
You know, soon we'll all be
completely lonely because
of those machines, those computers.
Sandrine?
Good evening, sir.
There's nobody left.
Will you turn off the lights?
As always.
- Thank you, goodbye.
Stop it.
Yes.
One moment, please.
The Japanese.
Hello? Delacroix speaking.
Yes, how are you?
Fine, fine.
Yes, the contracts will be ready.
Within two months.
Stop it.
Don't do that.
