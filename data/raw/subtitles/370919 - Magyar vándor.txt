Álmos?
Wrong.
He's here, sleeping off
that koumiss of yours.
L'll kill you
if you say 'koumiss' again!
What's got into him?
Funny you're asking.
That horrid goo of yours
was at least 120 proof,
and alas the proof of the koumiss
is in the drinking.
You wanted
a low-budget farewell party,
but found
no sponsor for the conquest.
The conquest!
Rise, my friends, rise!
Rise Magyars...? Hm.
Rise Magyars,
rise Magyars,
pampapam,
your country, your country...
Not now, if you would,
our country calls us.
What is it now?
Don't ask me.
How long do we scan the horizon?
How should I know? This will be
the first historic conquest l've made.
We can't just leave without a word.
We need a break for suspense,
then say those
famous last words to them.
To whom?
The six hundred thousand Magyars
behind us waiting for the sign.
There's not a single Magyar here.
Nonsense.
They can't have left without us.
We are the seven chieftains.
Five.
What do you mean?
There's only five of us here.
Who's absent?
Ond.
And Kond.
They surely did not have a drop of...
Whoever dares
to say koumiss again...
They can't go far on two chieftains.
If it's Ond.
And Kond.
They can't be far away.
I think we should go after them.
After them!
After me!
# If you stay with me
l'll stay by your side #
# If you stay with me
l'll never run and hide #
# Where would I go,
what would I do all on my own #
# Two single tickets are better
than one return #
# Home is right here
with you by my side #
# You're looking away
but I know it's alright #
# Wherever you lay
your hat is my home #
# The lamplight in your eyes
is leading me home #
# Home was a place
that we knew by heart #
# Where Dad held us high
so close to the stars #
# We'll be home wherever we stop to stay
We stand tall but the stars are far away #
# The blood flowing
through your heart #
# May drive you off one night #
# But then it will make you turn around
you'll head for a place you belong #
# No big deal,
it's just a one-gallon ride #
# But it's gonna take you home #
I wonder why they didn't wake us.
They left us behind just like that.
Just like that?
I said 'just like that'.
Does it matter anyway?
In fact, it does.
L'm pissed off
'with the way you speak Magyar'.
I have a good reason to speak like this:
I am an aristocrat,
the ruling class.
Then we are classmates, chum.
Still we can say properly:
She sells sea-shells on the seashore.
No?
See shells she sells etc...
Congratulations. Those poor
Hungarians have got some chieftains.
It's just that the chieftains
haven't a single poor Hungarian...
Except Ond...
and Kond!
Where the hell are they?
Hey, Ond!
I told you that you are Ond.
L'm Kond!
You've just said, I am Kond!
Yes, I said I am Kond!
Sure. But if I am Kond,
then you are Ond.
...And I am Kond!
- Or you are...
- Hey, where have you gone?
I see what?
You see.
You said, where are you, Kond?
But if I'm Kond,
then you must be Ond, right?
No! I said 'where have you gone'.
So why did you just say, hey Ond?
Why, isn't that your name?
I like gentlemanly sports,
but l'm done.
L'm about to drop with fatigue.
If you can drop any further,
l'll stand you a tankard of...
Tankard? A tankard of what?
- Not that. - Not what?
Come on, say it! Not what?
Not... er... not.
Mare's milk?
Mare's milk! Not that!
Isn't that the same as koumiss?
Carry on hunting!
We've been feeding
on berries and leaves for weeks!
Berries! Yellow berries!
Leaves! Yellow!
He's nuts.
Small yellow berries...
Against fatigue! Ten to a leaf!
The Magyars' great invention!
We'll be famous!
Lt'll be called...
vitamin C!
Strange. Why C?
And why 'vitamin'?
What's the point of sticking
yellow berries in a leaf?
It seemed a good idea...
And that seems to be our dinner...
Hey, Ond!
- Kond!!!! - Yes?
- Kond!!!! - Yes?
What do you mean, yes??!!
You've just called out, Kond!
Because I am Kond!!!
It'S not my business?
You should see the shaman?
I'm afraid you're sick.
You are sick, you glutton!!!
And I can't see the shaman
because he left with all the others
and we have got stuck here
because of you.
The only one stuck here is me
and it's only because
this pass is so narrow.
What did you expect of a pass?
It was big enough
for six hundred thousand
with horses and
can'ts to pass through.
All you do is pig out day and night.
Just why did I let you go first?
I should have known better.
You raised no objections last night.
You kept silent throughout the party.
You were having such a smashing time.
I thought, 'why kill the party'?
L've killed Ond!
This is Kond.
What was he doing here alone?
And where are the Magyars?
Where's Ond?
I'm here, suck in the pass!
How did he get in there?
It seems
he made a pass at the pass.
I told you at the outset...
You alive?
Lt's not my day...
I though it was a deer's antlers...
Because it WAS a deer's antlers.
It'll never happen again...
That's what you said last night,
then you went at the koumiss bottle...
Having a good time, eh?
Ha-ha.
Who did you...
wave good-bye to
if you were the last to pass?
To Kond?
To our ancient homeland.
It's the least our endless
steppes deserve, you agree?
Where are those endless steppes?
Lt's all rock here.
Very smart of you.
But what do we do next?
Let's just go one steppe further.
Or else we'll get stuck here
for the rest of our lives.
And no Magyars in sight!
Tseep.
- There's one there! - Tseep-tseep.
Sirk, papel and gunpowder.
Tseep-tseep.
Sirk, papel and gunpowder.
Tseep-tseep.
Sirk, papel and gunpowder.
Tseep-tseep.
Sirk, papel and gunpowder.
I swear she is not Magyar.
Why not?
The Magyars are almond-eyed,
short, black-haired guys, aren't they?
Sure they are.
Small, almond-eyed and black...
Tseep-tseep.
Sirk, papel and gunpowder.
But we are not like that at all.
That's because we are the chieftains,
not the people.
Not to wolly! Clever things
will get him unstuck and
they are so tseep.
She's not Magyar.
Tsinese vendor,
help poor Magyars,
she sell tseep gunpowder,
sirk and paper.
Where's the 'sirk'?
Here! But it's not sirk, it's sirk!
But the mister could do
with some gunpowder now!
What for?
Light it, lun away and
then big fireworks!
Rock will boom,
bang to rittle pieces! And tseep!
What's the price?
Plice?
How much is it?
Tseep. Very tseep!
We'll make a balgain!
Of course, luv.
You give us that gunboom
and you'll NOT get three knocks
on your lovely head from my friend Tas.
A good deal for everybody.
No, it's not enough.
Three will not do!
Four! Four is very tseep indeed!
Four what?
Four what?
I give you gunboom and
your friend not give me
four knocks on my lovely head. Four.
I must consult with them.
It's a deal.
You won't get four knocks then.
How about five?
Four's too low.
- Five!!
- Don't push your luck, love!
Lt's O.K.
No plobrem. I only joking.
You'll light this...
and then lun away!
Who can make fire?
Count me out.
It's a menial job in my tribe.
L've once seen someone do it
with two pieces of wood!
Fire! Piece of wood! Stick! Fire!
Stick of wood! Fire!
It's really worse
than if someone said...
Don't ask me what!
- What what?
- I know you know.
I know what?
I know you all want
to trick me into saying 'koumiss'!
Sticks of wood with coloured heads.
A great invention of the Magyars!
We'll be famous!
It will be called...
the match!
That's right, the match.
Match? Makes no sense.
What's the point of putting
a read head on a stick of wood?
They fit nicely in your pocket...
Pocket?!
Where did I go wrong?
Where's Kond?
Over there by the fire.
I knew we would never make it!
- Why didn't you say there was a fire?
- Who am I to say anything?
Anyway,
we can light this thing at last.
May one inquire
what you intend to do?
Easy.
We'll just light this gunboom!
What else do we do?
The little lady said we'd have to run.
There's something
I can't comprehend...
Didn't you say it was for the rock?
Yes. Why?
Hey!!!
We've made it.
We've made the pass!
Hurray. We've all made it.
We've all made the pass!
Without being a spoil-sport,
I wish to note that
I did not make the pass.
Maybe if you could
pull in your belly?
Well if I must...
Now, get the horses across!
Meanwhile l'll have
a man-to-man talk with Ond!
Easy! Lt's not sure that's me.
How do you know that
he is not Ond and I Kond?
Give me a break. We've got to
get started. It's almost evening.
It is the evening... the evening.
It is the evening of the day,
pampapa-pampapam...
Quiet!
Quiet, quiet, my friend.
Or else
we'll never find our lost Magyars.
What does it say?
Feher... varu... rea...
mene... hodu... utu... rea.
Pardon me, my friend?
That's what it says:
Feher varu...
No such thing as a white crow!
Perhaps a written relic.
Forget it. After me!
After me!
This Cabernet Sauvignon
from Villány
is specially reserved for you.
- This is, Béla, the third...!
- Yes?
Lt's your second, duckling.
Second what?
The second... nosy-parkering...
the second...
high-treasoning.
Get it? High treasoning! Hahaha!
Just because l'm your mistress...
A mistress...
Miss Stress!
That's a good one...
Get it? My Miss Stress,
my throne, my crown, my...
My Miss Stress,
my throne, my crown, my...
- Bottle?
- That's your third.
L'm sorry you've lost
your head, duckling.
That's a good one. Lost her head.
Get it? Her head. Lost it.
Get it?
You don't get it.
Chop off this lovely head!
What you're doing, idiot?
You said, chop off this head...
Which head?
I don't know, you're king here!
- L'm just first guard.
- Second.
What?
You're second guard.
L'm the first.
- You got it wrong.
- You got it wrong.
Really? Then...
why do I have the scepter?
Because you wanted
to chop its head off, you moron.
Why...?
'Chop off this lovely head!'
What do you think it means?
It surely does not mean the scepter.
What does it mean then?
The door.
Shhh! Lt's Anonymus!
Who is it?
Aah... ah... errr... aah
Ah... er... ah?
But who is ah?
Who's out there?
A- ah... I!
I? It cannot be I!
And I cannot be he.
What is your name...
intrusive stranger?
Rr... a. A... my name?
Yes! What's your name, son?
What's on your calling card?
Scribe.
I see, scribe...
And what else?
Nothing else?
No! Just...
dot dot dot, scribe!
Great!
You're on the 'dot dot dot'!
Come on in, my good scribe!
You called, your majesty?
Don't look so gloomy!
I have an idea.
An idea? Lmpossible.
Ignoring your sneer,
l'll give you
an important assignment...
After them! After me! All I hear
is whooping and yippying.
But you don't know
where the hell we are.
And what we are looking for.
A roadside inn.
I could do with
a dish of paprika potatoes...
What's potatoes?
Lt's something like paprika!
And what's that?
I got a craving for it.
Is that wrong?
The problem, buddy, is that
we have no idea which way to go!
I can see a light! See a light!
If you start reciting poetry,
you'll get knocked
on the head pretty hard!
No, no, this time it's real.
Real light! Look!
Don't dream of finding an inn.
We'll see.
By the way, after me!
# It hurts so much to be an ACE-
COMBINE myself with you #
# Let's go to my place #
# It hurts to be this smart, love
While you are so very plain #
# l've tried to boost your brain
But all in vain #
# Honey, l'd love to lose my mind
Just so I don't have to lose you #
# l'd rather be your stupid one
With a low IQ! #
Hey, buddy, bugger off my girl!
L'm ever so sorry...
# You're such a clumsy liar
Fooling me is a losing game #
# No chance to shit to me
Since you are so lame #
# lt's not my fault, believe me
Just how witless you've been made #
# To keep you by my side
l'd be featherbrained #
Toast and jam?
There's no a la can'te?
Today we want to eat like kings!
Vi-kings!
L'm sorry, from seven to nine
we only serve continental breakfast.
But you've surely got a sauna.
A what, sir?
A wooden shed,
where you can sit in the heat.
Naked!
Oh... you mean that!
Round the house in the backyard. But in
this country, it will do if you drop your pants.
Just leave it to me.
L'm the Viking here.
Wait. You take the room first.
All these guys come in,
do their 'sauna'
and leave without paying.
We'll take the top floor if you want.
No way.
I only have one free room left...
but I can put in a folding bed.
Hey, buddy...
we've heard that
you've seen much of the world...
Just me.
These two are always drunk!
So, being the globe-trotters
that you are...
Globe-boozers.
Koumiss tourism.
You wouldn't happen to have seen
six hundred thousand Magyars
around here?
...What?
...Six what?!
Magyars!
We are, that is we are supposed
to be their chieftains!
This is Elõd...
Ond...
Kond...
Tas...
he is Huba...
and he is Töhötöm.
- Huba.
- What is it?
My name is Huba, not Ruba.
And l'm... Álmos!
Sorry, all rooms engaged, but...
you can drop your pants
in the back if you like.
Tell me,
what are those Magyars like?
You've just seen them.
But l'll never
let them in here, I swear.
They think
that white horse is a big deal.
They can have their meadows
and lands
but tourism is still in our hands.
Long live the Pan-Slav union!
Lt's cool!
'Write me something nice,
my good scribe'.
Cultural dictator.
Woe is me!
At least
he could dictate to me, but no.
'Find some grand subject,
my good scribe.'
A gigantic subject.
Where should I look,
my good king Béla?
Where?
Why, The history of rivers.
Or maybe
The conquering salmon.
I am a genius.
Migrating fern trees.
It will surely be a pot boiler.
Or I could write about
The glorious deeds of horses.
A blockbuster.
How my poor mother
wanted me to be chancellor.
Dynamic, upwardly mobile team.
He-he! Thanks.
I would prefer
to be downwardly mobile.
What was that?
Not 'that': Who?
There was a scream!
Actually he tripped over me.
Hey! Who's over there?
Or what?
Eer... aaah...
I can hear eer aah.
Maybe he's hungry.
I myself dreamt of
a big pot of goulash... And more.
What is goulash?
That's...
A little better than paprika potato!
We must get started
or we'll never find the Magyars!
Wow, Magyars?
Not bad.
The deeds of the Magyars.
Vow, l've got the title!
The deeds of the Magyars,
even better, Gesta...
Gesta Hungarorum.
What a subject!
I wish I knew
who this six madmen were...
Seven.
We're making progress.
# Remember, for God's sake

Stake Tartare again?
You should be grateful:
For guests only.
If the boss finds out, l'm done for.
If the guests try it,
you're again done for.
They won't.
We haven't had one guest
since we got hold of this lousy hotel.
It's better to be in here than meet that
idiot, Batu Khan on the battlefield.
I wonder what we wants
this poor country for.
Any urgent matter?
Are the Mongols after you?
Want a room?
No... l've come
to have my piles cured!
L'm afraid
you got the wrong address.
Of course I want a room.
What else would I want in a hotel?
All right, all right.
It was just a question.
- Your name?
- Ba...
Tu... Tuba!
Tuba. Strange name... like it was
made up on the spot.
Job?
Kha... can't mechanic...
A can't mechanic,
that's even stranger.
Not that I care.
Well, do you want breakfast?
I don't think so.
Room number six.
Up the stairs and left.
I may have guests.
Kind of soldiers,
you know,
kind of... chieftains.
Certainly, sir.
L'll send you a kind of message
to your kind of room.
Water!
A pond...
Yes?
Nothing.
Of course, it's nothing.
And nobody.
I told you at the outset.
Wait a second, buddies.
L'll take none of your defeatism.
I want to make a fat lot of money...
in a juicy little job with the Magyars.
Please stop talking
about fat and juice, will you?
This way or another,
the ancient aristocrat was right:
The die is cast!
Look this way
- and that. The die.
It's a cube.
A die means a cube!
Not again...
What can't you
keep your mouth shut?
A cube made up
of many small cubes!
A great invention of the Magyars!
We'll be famous! Lt'll be called...
Magic cube, eh?
...no, no! It makes no sense...
It'll be called Rubik's cube!
And... what's that good for?
You twist it and twist it,
until all its faces are the same colour!
Elõd!
...All faces are the same colour.
You have a point...
You see,
the die is cast... away.
Did you see that?
I don't know what you saw,
but what I did
l'd never seen before.
Poor creatures,
they can't afford swimming costumes.
Those shapely hips...
and black hair...
...and almond eyes...
Magyars!
Stop it! Put me down,
or l'll call the chef!
What's going on?
One madman after the other...
So sorry, buddy. You know,
we're looking for the Magyars!
You, too? Hopeless.
Batu Khan has been
on their trail for half a year,
but they have vanished.
No Magyars left.
I told you.
I swear he hasn't got a free room!
You're wrong, Sir.
We have large numbers of them.
How many?
One. But it has a lovely view.
Your names, please?
What's going on?
Nothing.
They are still there?
Yes. All seven of them.
Let's rehearse it once more.
We have bad news,
oh great Batu Khan!
You said Tattoo Khan.
You think I didn't notice?
All right. Then you go alone.
I won't. We sink or swim together.
Listen.
What?
You must be on the lookout
for anything interesting inside.
I can't be on the lookout
when l'm looking in.
What's going on inside?
Those seven idiots, and the
receptionist crying. No, he is not...
...l'm so sorry.
I know that
these are not real names.
But there was this Tuba,
and now Töhötöm...!
Not Tuba, Huba!
What do you mean, not real?
We all are real aristocrats!
And real chieftains!
More precisely...
we are just kind of chieftains...
Kind of soldiers?
Very well put.
Aha! Someone's expecting you!
Up in number six!
You have room nine!
You had better leave that to me.
Who is it? ...Don't disturb
unless you are the chieftains!
We are the chieftains!
But not mine!
Don't be so sure, buddy!
But I am. You can't deceive the kahn...
the kind of person I am.
Good night.
Excuse me, are you Magyar?
Do I look like one?
More or less...
l'm not Magyar, and
I wouldn't like to be one.
Enough of this damned country!
Well, then let's go to bed...
I think, they're chieftains.
Using false names.
Oh yes, but it's a secret.
They're expecting us...
Room number six. All the other
mental patients are there.
Go to bed, buddies.
We'll rise early tomorrow!
What for?
Nothing ever happens to us.
- For a week now...
- For a week now...
For a week now, mom's been...
Mother's darling, enough of you.
And now we all go to bed.
First piece of good news today.
We have bad news,
oh, great Batu Khan!
- You said Tattoo Khan again.
- I did not.
You're terrible.
Let's have another go.
We have bad news...
Err... So sorry.
We're out of here.
In fact, we were never here!
You think they will charge extra
for the folk culture show?
You let my name slip, you idiots!
I tell you, I was incognito?
We know that,
and you look smart in it.
This is a... kimono, moron!
Incognito means
that no one knows l'm here!
But I do.
Aren't you the great Ba...
Shut up, you mongoloid!
What about the chieftains!
Have you found the king?
Eer... not quite.
What do you mean 'not quite'?!
We haven't.
Enough of you both.
A message to the great Batu Khan!
Shhh!
He is in kimono!
Why didn't you shoot the letter through
the window as befits a dramatic moment?!
Shoot it in? You're joking!
Look at these arrows?
Not up to Mongol standards for sure!
Sorry, it was a bargain sale.
Some Tuba and his
six pals dumped them to me!
You know the old Swiss saying?
Save us, oh Lord,
from the arrows of the Magyars!
You'll write it down
a hundred times!
Get it?
We're going to have
elections back home!
- Really? - Really?
- Really. - Really.
I would not stay
a minute even if those
Magyar chieftains were just next door!
Go to bed now, buddies!
Tell the receptionist I want the bill.
We're going home!
Are we?
We are.
It was a busy place last night.
The house is deserted...
no merry chil'...
No merry chil'.
There's nobody here!
They're all gone! And it's morning!
So what, wise guy.
Understand? They're gone!
We went to bed, and by the time we woke,
we were left alone. Like after the farewell party!
This is truly amazing.
I thought it was truly boring.
Did you?
Let me remind you that you too
vanished by morning, you and Kond!
L'm liking this mix-up...
l'm not. Enough of this mix-up!
Ond...
Kond!
What's so difficult about it?!
It happened once
and now we again wake up
to find everybody gone.
They did not even wake us!
This means...
That we file a complaint?
We won't give them tip?
That we have to stay.
It's a sign!
I don't believe in signs!
Anyway, what's there to do
in a deserted hotel
without a receptionist?
# The Grand Hotel
is real good business #
# Pa-pa-param #
# All along the shiny corridors
Ladies and gents in and out the doors #
# Pearls and diamonds #
# Over salmon with almonds #
# The wine is vintage
The deal is linkage #
# None of your messages
Will get lost in the passages #
# The Grand Hotel

# Make a grand

# If you make it, it's a quick buck
If you don't, it's tough luck #

Are not used by alligators #

Chicks are hot and the water cool #

By the way,
how about the Magyars?
The Magyars?
They've got on quite well without us...
Got on their horses without us.
Let's vote.
Raise your hand. Who votes
for the hotel business and wealth,
and for this wandering life...?
Well, what's wrong?
We can't vote on both propositions
at the same time.
Well, Tas?
Why me?
You are Tas, aren't you?
Sure.
What's your vote?
I vote for electing a new chairman.
- Great.
- I meant me.
Right. Who would like me to conduct
the ballot, and who would like Elõd?
What's wrong now?
L'll chair the ballot, period. What
happened to this? It worked last night.
Let me try.
I knew it...
This is a sign.
Fate bids us to continue
searching for the Magyars.
Don't overexert yourself.
It's just me.
Who're you making this show for?
You've been waiting here nine years
for someone to buy this number.
In this boring dog-forsaken place.
I have had enough of all that!
You promised to marry me
and take me to the capital.
Soon l'll be an old spinster of sixteen.
Stop playing
the waiting game with me!
Should I go!
Marry me and take me to Buda!
You serf!
Show me the way
to Buda town, you serf!
Hello, buddy!

Hello, chum.
Welcome, good strangers.
Welcome to the land of an uneducated
And evil king, ruling our poor country.
What's a king? Kind of a chieftain?
Some chieftain, indeed...
a tyrant oppressing this poor people.
What people? The Magyars?
Come on,
the Magyars are all gone.
The place is swarming with dagos,
the queen and her hangers-on.
You should be saying
'down with Mátyás'!
Why should we
say such things, buddy?
Why..., up at the court, they're just
flaunting their golden cutlery,
eating their roast capons,
like those Florentine faggots.
By the way,
I hope we're not late for dinner.
Dinner? Hahaha!
There's simply not enough
decent food to go round,
is there?
And King Mátyás
talks of an economic upswing.
I would not be surprised, if you said
'send him to the gallows'!
Relax!
We don't even know this Mátyás!
He is easy to recognize by his nose,
as big as a church spire!
I would not be surprised,
if you called him Mátyás, the big nose!
L'd much rather call him,
Mátyás, the nice guy!
Why would you? He travels incognito all
the time, instead of ruling the country!
Hoping, he will catch someone
saying 'down with Mátyás', or
Mátyás, the big nose!
Then, he would delight in giving
the poor guy twenty lashes
or send him to the gallows.
He loves it!
Tell me, what kind of king is this?
What kind?
L'm asking you.
Come on, speak up,
he is a plainclothes
dago-loving swindler,
a... a provocateur!
Lt's just not fair...
- Who's the best?
- Dó-zsa!
- Who's the best?
- Dó-zsa...!
What was that?
Listen...
- Who's the best?
- Dóóóó-zsaaaa! Dóóóó...
- Who's the best?
- Dóóóó-zsaaaa! Dóóóó...
Maybe, they are the Magyars?
- Who's the best?
- Dóóóó-zsaaaa!
- Who's the best?
- Dóóóó-zsaaaa!
- Dóóóó-zsaaaa! Dóóóó...
I don't believe so, my friend.
This is just gobble- de-gook,
to use lower class language.
What if they are?
They can't have gone a long way!
Well, what are we waiting for?
For you, buddy!
Oh...
After them!
After me!
Thugs! Male chauvinist pigs!
Wait!
Madam, are you Magyar?
Her, Magyar?! Hahaha!
Madam, maybe you?
Me?
We're beautiful Turkish ladies?
We want to join a harem!
Harem, what's a harem?
Maybe some women's charity?
Or men's?
You think we're dressed up
as Turks to be admitted to a harem?
Now, listen duckling...
Let me handle this! Look, ladies.
We are looking for the Magyar army.
Hundreds of thousands of men, women...
Hundreds of thousands of men?
I wish I found at least
one man around here?
They're all drunk in some fortress and
bite the dust before they could say...
Petting.
What?
What's this woman talking about?
L'm talking about that, yes!
Kidnap me right away!
And take advantage of me! Clear!?
Tie me to the saddle!
We want to be your slaves!
Or at least your Slavs!!!
That did not work.
It's not our day.
No.
Have the eunuchs arrived?
I don't think so.
# 'Wish I knew as I look around
Why hearts are burning #
# Why every guy's kneeling on the ground
All the men are yearning #
# Why heroes and superstars
Are crawling to me #
# Made up mind and I dropped my bras
Made myself a beauty... #
# But l'm getting tired, so sick and tired
So very tired, so sick and tired #
# l'm so uninspired, hate to be admired
Anywhere I look they all want me wired #
# Showtime... #
Have the eunuchs arrived?
Don't think so.
Unless they arrive before
the pasha comes, l'm finished!
No way.
You think, I can get away with it?
Get away with it,
you must be joking.
It will be the end of you.
Why did I take this job. I say, I resign!
You are the manager!
Sorry, no way, buddy.
Who promised
the pasha a full-size harem?
Why? It did not take us a day
to collect these wenches.
You can't keep your head about water
without extra services!
You won't keep your head at all.
They'll make it.
- They promised me at the job centre...
- The job centre?
Yes. Why?
Big guy with a moustache?
In a turban?
- All Turks wear turbans!
- His name Yusuf?
- All Turks are called Yusuf.
- My name is Ali.
Mine is Mustafa.
Really? Mine, too.
L'm Mohammed!
L'm Yummurdjak.
And what about this Yusuf?
You can forget about your eunuchs.
- He got me this job.
- You see!
As manager. But I don't mind
being a receptionist. And alive.
Wait until I get the silk rope?
Not in my life... Allah, Allah!
My private life is
no business of yours.
I was so happy
to use my weapon again.
You know, after so many years.
What's this about weapons?
My friend is trying to explain to you
that we have been missing
some manly challenges of late!
So, you are...?
Yes, we are.
Our swords have lain idle
and our capabilities untapped...
Thank you. You're here at last!
I have a strange feeling that
these are still not our Magyars.
What's so strange about it?
We haven't met one since we set out.
I wonder if they exist at all. In fact,
l'm not sure we are Magyars.
And l'm not sure
if I told you at the outset.
Enter this gentlemen in the book,
these are... you know... those guys!
Are you infidels?
Oh, no. We are Hung... hungry
from the long journey
behind us, buddy,
we are foreigners.
Ah, guest workers!
I can get you pork, if you want!
We do.
So, your names? And jobs?
No time for this, sonny. His highness,
the pasha is on his way here.
Who is the manager?
That master organiser...
- It's me!
- It's me!
He's just resigned,
and l've taken over!
Lt's a lie! I just wanted to, but...
I did not even want to.
Why would I?
Well, let's try a second time!
- Who is the manager?
- Me! - Me!
I ask you for the last time
who is the manager of this claptrap?
He should have been sent
a silken rope long ago.
It's him!
L've resigned. And he's taken over!
Lt's a lie! He just wanted to, no,
he didn't even want to. Why resign?
We're not getting anywhere.
Bring them along!
Are these your famous eunuchs?
We've picked them up in the ditch.
They say that you hired them.
Or you?
If these are your eunuchs,
I can imagine your harem!
Those are not mine!
Mine are here!
Well, that's quite interesting.
You know what's interesting?
We don't understand
a word of your gibberish!
Indeed. When will you show us
to our suite? And you can skip
the folk performance, we found
the last one rather hard to appreciate.
And how about dinner?
This guy mentioned pork!
I just read out the house rules!
To tell them what is forbidden!
Foreigners, but highly professional.
We'll see. Show me to their suite!
You may go.
Shhh. You hear this?
L'm sick of it all.
I hear some wanton females
whiling their time away
- with exotic dances. No?
- Yeah.
And giggling in the meantime.
Ah... Seasoning life's monotony
with a pinch of cynicism...
l'm sure you're bored with the harem.
But not as bored as me!
You know what's it all about?
To do me in!
Of course, you understand.
I thought you might have a trick or two
up your sleeves... to exhaust them.
To floor them completely!
No, no, I did not mean that.
I know, of course, that you can't.
You're even less capable than me.
Play tag with them, or whatever...
Just conk them out
or else l'll lose face.
You have a job to do, boys!
I wouldn't mind
if some of them escaped.
His door, too,
is completely unnecessary.
After you, my friend...
My name is Kond.
Ond.
Ond Kond!
# Who is the master #

Leaving so soon, ladies?
You stay right here. Relief is coming.
Relief?
The night shift.
When we spend the night in the woods,
we'll get a fright in the morning!
L'd rather get a fright in the morning
then a heart attack at night.
- Your jokes are in bad taste...
- Talking of bad taste...
This sounds like...
Gunboom!
Maybe somebody's got stuck?
Hurray!
He has surely freed himself.
The Magyars!
Not Ruba, Huba!
L'm a chieftain of the Magyars!
We only have one chief: Rákóczi!
Hurray!
Nonsense, he is not on our payroll.
There are seven of us... Álmos...
They were not Magyars.
Hardly.
They called themselves Kuruc.
General Wienerschnitzel!
Yes. Oh, you're much
too loud for me, son.
It's been a shouting match
round here since March.
Yes.
L'm at your command.
L've done enough commanding today.
Das ist ein...
- What's this?
- Ein message...
from general Aufwiedersehen.
Shall I read it out?
Retreat!!
The Hungarians have broken free!!
Again?
L'm really tired of it all.
When will it be over?
Hi, buddy!
We are the chieftains of the Magyars!
Magyars...
Thank goodness! At long last!
You sir... a Magyar?
My friend,
l'm an Austrian general.
But... I hereby surrender!
We may go!
Austrian? How strange.
He looks like my brother-and-law.
Capture me and exchange me for
someone on the Hungarian general staff.
And l'll be in Vienna in three weeks.
We are the general staff
of the Magyars.
And we're not going
to swap anyone of us.
But I have surrendered.
Is that clear?
No, not quite.
Well, this is not my day.
Come on son!
We'll retreat.
You can keep the hotel.
Entschuldigung!
Well, shall we take a vote?
Hello!
L'd rather skip it, buddy.
I could do without a folk performance.
The last one puts out the light.
- This is suspicious!
- What? - Where?
We've spent the night in the woods
and no one gave us a fright!
Speak for yourself, mate.
Don't take offence, but you're even
worse than a folk performance!
Watcha!
Gotcha!
Whoops!
I was wrong, my friend.
Getcher asses off the ground!
And gimme all the dough you got!
What did he say?
Would you repeat, buddy?
And gimme all the dough you got!
Or there's gonna be trouble.
I don't understand a word.
Must be because of the mask.
Cut the crap,
or l'm gonna get pissed
and shoot your asses off!
They're not Magyars.
I should have known.
What the hell,
are you deaf, or what?
Gimme the dough
or l'll shoot
your asses off!
Let's bloody stone them, boss!
I knew...
Hey!!! Beat it, chum!
L'm ever so sorry, gentlemen.
I won't disturb you anymore.
Hey, buddy. Who threw that here?
I didn't. Certainly not.
I kicked it, of course.
This is a football.
Ball!
What is a football?!
Well... it's just an experiment.
Is it a kind of invention?
Kind of.
We've come to this secret place
to work out the details.
Then, we'll go back to England.
I hope, I can count
on your discretion.
Gentlemen!
What do they mean...
work out the details?
- What then? Shouldn't we go with him?
- Are you joking, buddy?
He is not Magyar, is he?
But he saved Ond's life!
We'll let him get away with it.
Our friend, Töhötöm is right!
We owe this gentleman a debt!
All they want us to do is
play with a ball.
And if we win, we can keep the ball!
And if we lose?
Shall we begin then?
And if we lose?
Easy.
If we lose,
they'll only get a horse.
You've bet your horse in a game
you don't know how to play?
What do you take me for, buddy?
I would never part with my horse.
You mean to say...
We'll beat them.

Eleven-two. Give me the ball.
Oh... that's not fair.
We were eleven of us, and you seven.
That means you lose three goals.
How did you work that out?
We're still working on the rules.
I don't care.
Let's make it eight-two.
Oh, I forgot to say that
if your goalkeeper is just as tall as...
And I forgot to tell you
that we don't have the time for this.
Four-two?
Seven. That's my last offer.
Six.
O. K.
- Six-three. - Listen, mate!
Don't push your luck! - All right,
see you!
We'll meet again!
# Something's burning inside me
No use taking vitamin C #

# A mummy in the mirror

# The morning after... #
Get away, Dezsö.
You can hardly make it
to this terrace, let alone to America.
Can't you see that
l've lost everything?
L'm stony broke.
We'll fix you in the morning.
Morning... where will I be then?
In bed with a chambermaid,
true to form.
And l'll take you back
three days later,
true to form.
Nothing will be the same again.
Understand?
Finito. The bitter end.
I did not get paid
for the last consignment.
And l've spent all remaining stocks
on this masquerade.
My one and only chance is
this lottery ticket.
It's either women or business.
Shall we help you, darling?
No, don't help.
Pubi Szikszai! Right?
Plus... Frici Rottler and company...
We are the chieftains of the Magyars.
Are you Magyar?
L'm queen of Egypt, dear Frici.
Surely, we don't like you
for your brains.
L'll take over as hostess for a while.
# And l'm dancing cheers to cheers
And run out of tears after so many beers #
# The morning after... #
Here you are, it's number six.
Can't you give us number nine?
You can have everything tonight.
You will excuse me...
# Coffee and tea don't help too much
Healing comes from the human touch #
# No help from a woman's vanity toys
Healing comes from the human voice #
# No help from the fruit-bowl
Healing comes from the human soul #
# The morning after... #
Strange. So many people gathered here
and not a single Magyar among them.
I don't care. L'm not going
to sleep in the woods anymore.
I myself would stay for a bite or two.
After all... we deserve a bit of fun.
# Give me some water to wash my brain
lt's no shine but it all is rain #
# No help from the fruit-bowl
Healing comes from the human soul #
# The morning after... #
The question, love is
Wine or beer.
Why not beer?
'Cos beer's ideal... ideal... ideal...

My dear, Pubi and friends are here.
They've managed to bring horses, too.
Too bad, all we can give is
some second rate punch.
Dezsö has ordered no koumis.
Did I say something wrong?
- I told you, we'd be late.
- I can't hear a thing.
They probably saw us from the
window. And they are hiding.
It was surely Trixi's idea.
I positively hate surprise parties.
I have an idea.
We'll outtrick them...
Have you prayed tonight?
Surprise!
That gunboom again.
Must be the Kuruc's again.
Once l'd like to wake up to find
that there's nothing to wake up to.
This will never be over.
I swear that these two are not...
Hands up!

Hey. That's not right.
Where's Ond?
Kond.
Er... Have I said 'Thanks'?
I knew you wouldn't.
You did, didn't you.
Thanks!
L've dropped out of shape.
I don't understand.
Last time
we were a real golden team...
I could've told you
we were heading for trouble.
Stop!
They look pretty low.
- And they have a lightning stick.
- And how big.
And we haven't got the ball.
Try another subject.
What?
Ask them if they happen to have seen
six hundred thousand Magyars.
I wonder if you happen to have seen
sixty thousand Russians round here?
How many... what?
Just like us, a lot of them.
Single file.
No, my friend, we have never seen
the likes of you in our lives.
We have seen a thing or two though.
How could they leave without us?!
They didn't even wake us.
How could they, indeed...
- Impossible!
- They simply left us behind.
Oh, those heartless conquerors.
The conquest is over.
This time,
we're going home for good.
Except that we've been left behind.
You see, we had a
farewell party last night...
I know how you feel.
Make sure
never to sleep in the woods!
And... avoid folk performances!
And harems!
And when you think you've really
had enough, then think of this:
...it can only get worse!
I told you.
Avay, avay.
Did you see that?
No, no, we did not, buddy.
It takes your eagle eye
to spot an oversized pink can't.
- What's wrong with you?
- I hate being laughed at.
Me, too.
And I like to be successful.
What success do you mean?
Maybe you have found the Magyars?
Our friend Töhötöm is right.
In hard times, we must enjoy
the little pleasures of life.
Little they were indeed.
And all alike.
A load of grinning identical twins.
All laughing at us.
If I were riding in a pink can't jammed
up with fifty-odd almond-eyed and
black-haired twins of mine, well,
I wouldn't feel like laughing at all.
They are all...
...Magyars!
After them!
# L've come to the wrong place
And I can't find the road #
# lt's all dark around here #
# And l'm still carrying the load #
# Carrying the load #
# I set out all unprepared
The storm struck fast and hard #
# But l'm still hoping to get by
l'm holding on, #
# don't lose heart #
# Don't lose heart #
# The sun in my eyes,
I dream along #
# She can take us both,
we're riding on #
# The sun in our eyes,
wandering free #
# Hop right on, right behind me #
# Just right here #
O.K. Let's take a vote. Who is
for passing through, and who's against?
All right.
Kond?
But he has no vote
on matters of passing.
As far as l'm concerned, l'm not
very keen. Seems a strange place...
I agree. Let's cross over the hill!
# Home is right here
With you by my side #
# Wherever you lay
your hat is my home #
# The lamplight in your eyes
is leading me home #
# Home was a place
that we knew by heart #
# Where Dad held us high
so close to the stars #
# We'll be home wherever we stop to stay
We stand tall but the stars are far away #
# The blood flowing
through your heart #
# May drive you off one night #
# But then it will make you turn around
you'll head for a place you belong #
# No big deal,
it's just a one-gallon ride #
All I can say
is let bygones be bygones.
No wonder,
they didn't wait for us.
Can you see what I see?
No. It takes your eagle eye to spot
six hundred thousand Magyars
right beneath our feet...
Let him be.
He has this thing about success.
You're O. K, Kond?
I told you we'd end up crying.
Did you say, Kond?
A strange place indeed.
How long
have we been sitting here?
No idea.
But this place is OK, isn't it?
The best place we can be, my friend.
I was wrong.
# Come follow me now
To a place we're sure to find #
# Whether it's night or day
Just follow me blind... #
# Like horses on the loose
The wilderness we roam #
# But we're always sure
To find the way back home #
# Every memory is calling me home
l've found a place l'm not alone #
# Every memory is calling me home
Yeah, in this crowd l'm not alone #
# The blood flowing
through your heart #
# May drive you off one night #
# But then it will make you turn around
you'll head for a place you belong #
# No big deal,
it's just a one-gallon ride #
# But it's gonna take you home #
Can you see what I see?
L'm afraid we can.
They're leaving.
Well, then?
What're we waiting for?
For you, buddy.
Right. After them!
After me!
After me!
