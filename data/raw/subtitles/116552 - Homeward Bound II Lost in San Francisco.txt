My name is Chance.
And this, this is home.
It's been my home
for a couple of years now.
And I gotta admit, they have been
the best two years of this dog's life,
except for one slightly incredible
journey over the mountains.
But maybe you already
know that story.
Like I was sayin',
they treat us pretty good here.
Three square meals a day, a
warm place to sleep at night...
and all the smelly sneakers
you can eat.
But even in a place like this, you know,
sometimes a dog can get a little restless.
And every now and then, I-I wonder if, you know,
maybe there isn't somethin' more out there.
- Hey, there is something more out there. I can smell it.
- Chance! Have you seen my shoe?
Don't panic.
I'm goin' in.
Chance, did you steal my shoe?
That's Jamie. He's the one who
rescued me from the bad place.
And as good as
I've got it around here,
Jamie is what makes it home.
So it's my job to protect him.
All right, trespasser, say your prayers.
You have got a date with the " Chancenator."
I have no choice
but to terminate you!
Yeah, you "butter" fly away!
Okay, the crisis is past.
The perimeter is secure.
Situation is neutralized!
Yep!
It's a thing of beauty
when Chance is on duty.
Speaking of duty, I thought
I smelled something. Yuck!
Now what's your problem?
Bad fur day?
I'll tell you what's bad,
O fragrant one. I saw suitcases.
- Why's that bad?
- Means the family's leaving.
Though who could blame them,
the way you smell!
All right. That's it.
Time for kitty soccer!
- Oh. No. No. No. Oh!
- Chance moves the fat cat downfield!
- Go! Go! Go! - Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Hope! Jamie!
Get your bag downstairs
so we can load up the car.
Car! Car! Did you hear that? He said
car! They're leaving! He said car!
Hey, you really think
there's gonna be a trip?
Oh! Oh! Watch your step!
- Whoa!
- Whoa! Avalanche!
Oh, my. That look is you.
Oh, man! Who says
cotton breathes?
Sassy!
I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Get it off! Get it off!
- Oh, my poor kitty.
Ooh, Chance. Take it off.
Take it all off.
Help me! Snout snuggy!
Get off my head! Get off...
So, Chance, dear, we're all so curious.
Do you prefer boxers or briefs?
Ah, will you just go get dipped?
I gotta find Jamie.
My gosh, sure is a lot
happening this morning.
We're goin' to Canada, boy.
We're takin' you with us.
Go? I'd go anywhere
with you, Peter.
- Peter, grab those bags for me, okay?
- Yeah. Sure, Dad. No problem.
Wait! Don't forget this.
I still think it's crazy to fly three
animals halfway across the continent...
for some camping trip.
Well, if we're going, just
let me use the litter box first.
- Where's my shoe?
- Jamie, let's go!
I'll meet you at the field
later, Stacey!
- Jamie!
- Where is it?
Jamie boy! I'm here.
It's your best buddy. Let's have
a little fun. Come on. Uh, no. Wait.
I'm not under there.
I'm in the door. Jamie! Over here.
No, I'm... I'm
not in the cupboard.
And it's a ground ball
out to left field.
Fielded nicely...
Oh, hey, tasty. Genuine cowhide.
Am I into leather.
No, Chance! Not my Barry Bonds
autographed baseball.
What are you doin'?
I was workin' on my spitball!
It's, uh, kind of tough to play
with the door closed, Jamie.
Jamie? Oh, man.
You never want to play anymore.
Hey, what's this? I'm gettin'
somethin' on the old nose radar.
That smells like sugar. Oh, please, be
sugar. Be sugar. Be sugar. It is sugar!
It's sugar and, and chocolate and dough
deep-fried in bubbling fat!
It is! It's doughnuts!
Sweet!
Oh! They'll never give one of these
babies up, unless, of course, I lick it.
- Yuck!
- Ah, ah, ah, ah! Chance!
You've already had
your breakfast. Twice, in fact.
So what? Y-You tellin' me you never heard
of a little thing called brunch? Huh? Huh?
Oh! Jamie's Ieavin'!
Well, Ma, like you always said.
Never play on an empty stomach.
We're leaving in 20 minutes.
Don't be late, Jamie.
Hey! Not so fast!
I'm tryin' to digest!
Where are we goin'?
Where are we goin'?
No, Chance!
Stay! Stay home!
Stay? But I... I got
this great sugar rush goin'.
Jamie, don't go. Hey, hey!
I thought we were gonna play.
I don't get it.
Did I do somethin' wrong?
Hey. Aw, come on. This isn't about
the doughnut, is it? I-I just took one.
I-I-I was weak.
It was taunting me.
- Geez. Take a hint already.
- Huh? What do you mean, take a hint?
Jamie's gonna send you
back to the bad place.
I'll miss you. Bye-bye.
- Well, I'm really gonna miss you too. Bye-bye!
- No! No! Don't!
Oh, no! No! I hate
these kinds of rides! Oh, God!
Oh, I just ate! I'm gonna
blow chow-chow everywhere!
Get me out of here!
I hate this!
Dogs rule and cats drool.
Jamie, my man!
Wait for me!
Oh, my head. Oh, my head.
Oh, I don't feel well.
Oh, just wait until I see you again.
Wherever you are, I'm going to...
Just wait 'til I... Oh, I don't
feel well. I'm going to hurt you.
- Here you go, infield.
- I got it!
- No, I got it.
- That's all right. Throw it back here.
- Hi, Stacey!
- Hi, Jamie!
Okay, this is gonna be fun.
Jamie! Hey, buddy! I'm here.
You're in luck. I'm ready to play!
No, game over, kids.
Me and Jamie got a play date.
So, you're all gonna
have to am-scray!
A grounder to Seaver. And he
flips it to first for the out.
Huh? What's this?
Who are you guys?
- I'm Sparky Michaels.
- I'm Lucky Lasorda.
And I'm Trixie Uecker.
And we're broadcasting here.
Yeah, so move your tail, buddy.
You're broadcasting the game?
Hmph. Sassy tells me
to get a life?
All right, here's the pitch.
A hard chopper to Seaver.
He picks it up and fires to first!
Boy, the kid looks great this year.
He must have been practicin'
that throw in the off-season.
Yep, and you're Iookin' at the
pooch he's been practicin' with.
That's fascinating. Really? Now,
get your tail off the field.
You talkin' to me?
Okay, I guess you are.
Okay, fine, hey, listen, I got no
problem. I'll just go sit in the front row.
- Here it comes again. Right to ya.
- Yep, it doesn't bother me.
- I'll just lie down here and hang out...
- Hit two.
And watch these kids throw this really
tasty-Iookin' leather ball around.
- Good, good. All right, right field!
- Oh, boy, this is torture.
- Play deep! Play deep!
- I can't take this anymore.
Hey! Whoa!
I got it! I got it!
What's this?
It seems a, a crazed fan...
has run onto the field
and taken the ball away.
- Ever see anything like it, guys?
- Not me. How about you, Uecker?
Never! And let me tell you, it's
a sad day for the sport of baseball...
and all of canine kind when
somethin' like this happens.
Oh, he's at the 20! He's at the 30!
He's at the... He's outta there!
I am just sickened.
Well, I know none of us likes to hear
the " B" word, but that is one bad dog.
Chance! How many times
do I have to tell ya...
to stay off the field?
Get the dog outta here, Seaver.
Hey. Hey, take it easy.
You push my human,
you're pushing me, babe.
- I've seen some pretty dumb dogs, Seaver.
- Excuse me. Dumb?
- Yours is pathetic.
- All right. That's it!
- Okay, I'll show you who's pathetic.
- Hey!
- Oh, hey, this tastes pretty good.
- Cut it out!
- Give it to me!
- Hey, you know, it's better than a baseball.
- You stupid dog!
- All right. I warned you! Yes!
He's going! He could be...
He might be... Yes!
That dog is outta here!
Hey, Jamie, you catch what I said to
that girl when I yanked her mitt away?
I go, Call me dumb, will ya?
No, Chance! Cut it out!
Okay, that's cool.
You be me, and I'll be the kids.
Hey, come back. Come back, you dumb dog.
Come on, you crazy mutt. Drop that mitt.
- Honeys, we're home!
- Oh, here he is.
Come on, honey. We're late.
Let's go. Let's go.
It's Chance's fault.
We chased him all over the park.
Now, come on, Jamie.
Don't be mad at me, pal.
I still don't see why we have to go
on a stupid camping trip anyway.
I'm gonna miss
the two most important games.
- Come on, Chance.
- Where we goin'?
- Oh, road trip! All right! Shotgun!
- Here you go.
Or the back. The back is good.
Very cool. All right.
Well, the start of another
fun-filled family vacation.
Okay.
Watch your nose, Chance.
So, guys, where do you
think they're takin' us?
I don't know about us, but
I know where they're taking you.
Well, I know this much.
Can't be anyplace bad,
or they would have given us
those dumb tranquilizers.
Hey, Peter, did you give 'em
the tranquilizers?
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh!
- We're doomed!
- Calm down.
- Nobody's doomed.
- Oh, yeah? Then let me ask you something, old-timer.
Why did they shove those little
green kibbles down our throats?
- If you're smart like me, you'll get rid of it.
- Get rid of it? How?
Easy. You just work up
a nice-sized hair ball,
and you think of
something disgusting.
Like a big, fluffy cat!
How pleasant.
Hey, I've been
Iookin' for that ball.
Ninety-nine cans
of dog food on the wall
Ninety-nine cans
of dog food, everybody
If one of those cans
should happen to fall
Ninety-eight cans
of dog food on the wall
- Cats only.
- I hate this song!
S-Shadow, they're gonna take ya
on the plane now. Don't be scared.
Oh, I'm not the pet
to worry about.
- Here you go, Sassy.
- Hope, this isn't first class.
- Come on. Whoa. Come here.
- Let me go, Pop. I-I got a thing about cages.
- Come on. It's all right.
- Oh, come on. Come on. You're makin' a scene here.
Uh-oh, man! You know what.
We gotta go back home.
I totally forgot to lock
the doggy door. Aw, great, Bob.
Thanks for listening.
Really. Thanks a lot.
A cage! They're treating me
like I'm some kind of an animal.
- Relax, Chance. You'll live.
- Hey, hey. D-Don't I get to call my lawyer?
- There you go.
- Here.
- Thank you. - Thanks.
- Guys, look!
They're Ieavin' us. Oh, this can't
be good. This cannot be good!
- Jamie, aren't you gonna say good-bye to Chance?
- See ya later.
Jamie? Buddy!
Don't let 'em take me away!
I'm sorry I was bad.
I'll be good.
Good-bye, Sassy. Good-bye,
Chance. We'll see you in Canada.
Bye, Shadow.
This'II be fun.
Jamie! No! Jamie!
Oh, man. Check out those dogs.
They don't look so good.
That's gonna be us, if we don't
find a way outta here.
Oh, no! Get a load
of those guys!
The uniforms! The helmets!
I recognize them! I know them!
They're takin' us
to the bad place!
Our humans wouldn't do that.
I had a feeling Jamie was mad at me,
but I didn't think he was this mad.
I can't go back to the bad place.
I swore I'd never go back.
- Stop it.
- You'll never take me alive!
I'm bustin' outta here!
There's gotta be a, a way out!
- Chance, don't!
- Somehow! - Wait!
Chance!
I'm free!
Where is that nutty mutt going?
Jamie, wait for me!
I'm comin' with ya, pal!
- Sassy, we've got to do something.
- Like what?
- We need to get out.
- You mean like this?
Honestly. Does the cat always have
to be the brains of the operation?
Beauty and brains.
I never cease to amaze myself.
Good work, Sassy.
Let's go!
I'm comin', Jamie boy!
- He went this way.
- Why couldn't Jamie have gotten a fish?
Hey! Hey!
Man, we got loose animals.
Better call Security.
Whoa, this is cool.
An obstacle course!
Chance! Wait for us!
This is fabulous!
Next year, I plan the vacation.
Whoa! Look out!
Heads up. Comin' through.
Jamie? Where are ya?
Let's lick and make up.
Wait! This is crazy.
- Ah, made it.
- Chance, please.
Jamie? Jamie?
Where'd you go?
Oh, gosh, Chance?
Listen, you gotta help me.
My boy's run away.
Maybe you've seen him? Short,
brown hair. Answers to Jamie.
You shouldn't
have left your cage.
- Good going, Chance!
- I thought they'd be up here.
Well, they're not, are they? Look,
there's a nice family. Go with them.
Stop arguing.
We've gotta go back.
- My thoughts exactly.
- Come on, Sassy.
Right behind ya, boys,
and I'm not enjoying the view.
- What is this thing?
- Just stay calm.
There's somethin' wrong here. I'm
tellin' ya. I can feel it in my bones.
Let's get outta here!
I mean, now! Hey, this way!
I think I see a shortcut.
Chance slides!
And he's gotta there!
Chance, you're gonna kill me!
Can someone tell me why I keep
following Dumb and Dumber?
Hey, Dad, do you think
the animals are okay?
Son, they're safe and sound
right below your feet.
Uh, Shadow, I don't see 'em.
Do you see 'em?
They're here somewhere.
I can sense it.
They must be on one of those.
Haven't we been here before?
Déja mew.
- Which one is it?
- Oh, that should be easy. They all look exactly alike.
Yeah, well,
we better pick one. Look!
Come on. We need
some help here.
- Let's do it!
- Let's go. Go, go!
Peter? He's in that one.
I just know it. Let's go!
We'll wait here.
They'll be sure to see us.
- I sure hope so!
- Don't worry!
- I'm worried.
- Ah, they'll stop. Right, Shadow?
They wouldn't leave without us.
Well, just to be safe,
I think I'll duck down.
Me too.
- They're not stopping.
- Hold tight.
- They're not stopping!
- They'll stop!
- They're not stopping!
- Oh!
- Peter.
- That was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying.
I wasn't scared. I wasn't
scared one wee little bit.
Obviously.
- Oh, no!
- It's the goon squad!
- Head for the fence!
- Run for your lives!
Here's an idea. I'll run.
You stay here and get hit.
Start diggin', Shadow!
Start diggin'!
Aw, great. Where's a gopher
when you need one?
If we weren't going
to the bad place before,
we're definitely
going there now!
I'm too old for this stuff!
Almost there. Almost there.
Why does this
always happen to me?
How come this never
happens to Lassie?
- Hurry! Hurry! Here they come!
- Owie! Help me! Somebody help me!
Amazing. All those years
of climbing up drapes...
I am so stuck.
Have finally paid off.
- Dig, Chance! Dig!
- I said I'll never go back!
- You can do it.
- Hurry, Chance!
Yes! Yes!
Give my regards
to the bad place, suckers!
Shadow, that thing left
without us, and Hope was on it.
- So was Peter.
- So now what are we gonna do?
Let me think. They probably
don't even know we're gone.
And guess whose fault it is.
Oh, so this is my fault? I just
saved us from the bad place.
No, you just got us lost again.
Like it or not, you two, we're
gonna have to find our way back home.
Home? You remember
what happened before?
Huge mountains, stinky skunks,
porky-pines. Not me, Pops.
Fine, stay here.
I'm going with Shadow.
- On we go.
- Go? You're crazy.
They're gonna come back for us. They're,
they're gonna come back right here.
And I'm gonna be waiting!
All by myself?
Uh, guys? Guys, fine. I'll come
with ya, but only because you insist.
So we walked and walked.
And just for a little change
of pace, we walked some more.
Questions began
racing through my mind.
Where were we?
How were we gonna get home?
Who decided
a Chihuahua was a dog?
And, most importantly,
when were we gonna eat?
Shadow, where are we?
I don't like this place.
Just stay close.
We'll be fine.
Hey. Hey, hey. Do you smell
what I smell? Eureka! Garbage!
Oh, boy, a burger.
Hey, does that mean...
Could it mean? Oh, that's...
That's fries. Mmm, cockroach.
Why are you dragging that?
I didn't hear anybody shout fetch.
Say hello to your home
away from home, Sass.
That? It's filthy.
My litter box is cleaner.
And I don't have anything
to sleep in.
- What? No cat's pajamas?
- Oh, you're a riot, Shadow.
Oh, boy, is this fabulous.
Who would have thrown
this out, huh?
All right, Sassy.
Time for bed.
Oh! I'll never be able
to sleep in here.
Delicious. You guys
missed a great meal.
I don't eat garbage.
Never have, never will.
We're going to sleep now.
Good night.
In there? You're gonna miss out
on all the great sights, sounds, smells.
You'd be safer in here
with us, pup.
Shh. This box smells
bad enough already.
Safe. Ha.
You forget I'm a bulldog.
I welcome danger with open paws.
And a constantly open mouth.
Give it a rest, you two.
We've got a long day tomorrow.
- What?
- What's that?
Uh, guys? Guys?
Look at... They're big.
- Th-They're huge. They're, they're comin' to get me!
- Here we go!
Hey, move over. Move over.
I'm comin' in.
- Ouch!
- It's all right. You guys are safe now.
Chance, you put the bull in bulldog.
Admit it. You're just scared.
Hey, I think the expression
is 'fraidy cat, not 'fraidy dog.
Uh, Pops, I don't want to knock your choice
of hotels, but I think we got a leak here.
And nothing smells worse
than wet dogs.
Oh, this is gonna be
a long night.
No, no. I'm sorry.
- Your attention, please.
- Hi. May I help you?
We regret to inform you that...
There's been a problem.
What happened, Dad?
Is it Shadow?
They say the animals got loose
somewhere at the airport.
They're outside in this weather?
Not here.
In San Francisco.
We... We have to go back.
We have to find them.
There's no sense in ruining
a whole vacation for everybody.
- I'll fly back in the morning.
- I wanna go home and find Sassy.
Look, you kids and your mom go
camping. You have a good time.
But, Dad, we won't have fun knowing
the animals are lost in San Francisco.
We should all go back.
Dad, please?
Okay. Come on. Let's go.
Just think, Sassy. Soon
you'll be home in Hope's arms.
I don't know how much longer
I can take this music.
Yo, I'm Rapmaster Chance
And I'm lost in the city
With an optimistic dog
and a sarcastic kitty
- Don't bother me when I'm
tryin' to get home - Oh, no!
I was so sure
this was the way home.
What? What is it? Can you see
the house from here? Whoa!
That doesn't look
like our backyard.
I can't understand it. We must be
much further away than I thought.
I trusted you to find our home,
and did you find it? No! We're lost!
Calm down. Yesterday we crossed
a golden bridge. That's the way home.
Okay, but can we please stop
for breakfast first? What do ya say?
The sooner we get moving,
the faster we reach home.
Okay, fine. But if we don't find
food, I got dibs on the cat.
I hope you didn't pay money
for that haircut.
The nerve.
Good morning, miss.
Hey, nice buzz, cuz. Get
in a fight with a lawn mower?
Peasant.
Dog, ho!
Pretty puppy.
Look at our pretty little girl.
And look at you, fat boy.
What do you want? Oh!
What's wrong
with the pretty puppy?
Did you wake up on
the wrong side of the bed?
You are so fat
you explode your own pants.
Come here, you little mutt.
- Come here.
- Oh, no. Don't you touch me.
- You stay away from me. No. Let... Let go of my leash.
- Jack.
- Jack. Jack!
- How dare you!
- Save me from this blubber ball!
- Hurry! Hurry!
- Oh, you put me down!
- What's the matter, princess?
- Help!
- Huh? Are we having a bad day?
- Take that, you swine.
- Hey!
Oh, I'm saved! Oh!
- Sir, is this your animal?
- Yes.
Why, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Don't
you know that there are scoundrels out here,
just waiting to steal
a beautiful dog like this?
Oh, don't kiss me,
you fat Grey Poupon.
Could I have my dog back,
please?
Au revoir, you miserable pig. I leave you
a special gift on your extra-large T-shirt.
- Geez!
- Floor it!
Shut up back there!
Man, do I hate dogs!
That mutt peed on me!
I had never seen anything
like this place before.
It was huge.
I had no idea what to expect, but
something told me it was gonna be fun.
Shadow kept insisting
he knew where we were going.
But I don't know. It seemed to me like
we were just walking around in circles,
which, to be honest,
was okay with me.
Heck, I was in no hurry.
Why should I rush home?
So Jamie could ignore me? Nah,
I was enjoying the here and the now.
Every now and then you gotta
just stop and sniff the hydrants.
What's this? The old nose radar is
pickin' up some pretty strong signals here.
Mmm, I'm gettin' warm.
Gettin' warmer, warmer.
Whoo! It's a buffet.
I see seafood.
Hey, Shadow, you're a retriever.
Fetch me a lemon wedge, would ya?
Ah, my favorite.
Sushi.
Hmm? I think I'll check out
the dessert tray.
Ah, fine. Didn't look fresh
to me anyway, crabby.
Oh, canines.
The feline's still hungry.
We're all still hungry, Sassy.
Better get used to it, babe. This is
the city. Only the strong survive.
- Well, then, you're a goner.
- Will you two quit bickering?
Okay, fine. I'll just starve.
Or not. Where there's a cat,
- Hi, Tiger.
- There's cat food.
- Stand back, boys, and watch a pro.
- This I gotta see.
- Oh.
- First you bound up, acting like you really wanna see him.
- Then make your cautious approach.
- Hi.
- Yes, isn't my fur long and silky?
- Nice kitty.
- You're a nice kitty. See, it's another kitty, like you.
- Cut the mush. Get the grub!
I don't believe it. The kid's
actually buyin' it. Heck, I can do this.
Chance!
- Hey, kid! I'm a pretty kitty too. See?
- Mom!
- Don't go!
- Mom!
- Isn't my fur long and silky?
- Mom!
- Bad dog! Go away!
- Beat it, moron.
Go away.
Lady, wait!
- I can't believe I said that.
- Chance.
Whoa. She must
really hate cats.
Only the cats
that look like you.
- Way to go, pup.
- They were about to feed me.
Now, just face it.
They didn't buy your act.
He was charmed by me. He was heading
for the can opener, and you blew it.
Oh, Shadow! Attila the Hungry
here has ruined everything.
We'll find food as we go.
We've gotta keep moving.
Yeah, keep movin'. That's what
I was tryin' to tell her, Shadow.
I mean, she...
She's such a time waster.
Me? I'm a time waster? Huh! Who
took half a year to paper train?
Oh, that's so funny
I forgot to bark.
We have to find that bridge. It
must be around here somewhere.
I don't see why we can't just
stop and ask for directions.
Oh, will you listen to her?
Listen, Sassy, we're guys, okay?
We don't ask for directions.
We don't need 'em.
We know where we're goin'
every step of the way.
Hey, punk! Watch it.
No offense, dude,
but you need a bath.
Hey, boss,
what's all the ruckus?
Yo, Pete, these runts
just trespassed on our turf.
Excuse us.
We're not from around here.
That so? They're not
from around here.
Where are you from?
Planet Stupid?
Look, they brought
their pretty little kitty too.
- Lunchtime!
- Hey, nobody messes with the cat but me.
- Sassy, run!
- Yikes!
- She's mine!
- Back off!
- Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my.
- Don't lay a paw on her.
Who's gonna stop me, old-timer?
Whoa. Hey. Did you know there's a long
furry thing growin' outta your butt?
- Huh?
- It's your tail, genius.
- I'm warning you!
- Thanks for the warnin'.
Get him, Shadow!
Stop it. Let go.
Hey, that hurts, man.
You got that right, Einstein.
Guys, they've got reinforcements.
It's an ambush. We're dog food!
- Watch this. Decoy duty.
- Yo, boss. It's Riley's gang.
Hey, flea bags! Come and get me!
If you think you're dog enough.
Yo, Ashcan! Why don't
you chill, home-fry?
- Cool it, Pete.
- Hey, hot stuff, why don't you butt out?
- Are you Iookin' to get fixed?
- Good one, Delilah.
I told you.
Stay off my turf, chump!
- Sassy, can you get away?
- Not with old... face in my way.
- You still there, kitty?
- Oh... Duh!
Don't worry, lady.
I'll save you. Hey, Pete!
- What is that pup doing?
- Bonehead, come get me.
- Whoa! Bombs away!
- Ah. I see. The old geranium to the cranium. Whoopsie.
- Ow!
- Yee-haw! That was great.
Pete, let's split.
That was some nice
fighting, stranger.
This ain't over yet, Goldie.
Watch your back.
Yeah. Your back.
I hope you're not
makin' threats, trash can.
Unless you want
to wake up at the vet's.
With a thermometer
under your tail.
Now, beat it.
Yo, what's up with you?
Don't you know this place
ain't safe for no pets?
Yes. Unfortunately,
we're lost.
Do you think we came here
on purpose? Guess again.
Ooh! Excuse me. My name's Riley,
but you can call me Riley.
That's Sassy.
I'm Shadow.
Wait a minute now. Wasn't there
another one of you pets?
Oh, boy! This decoy business
is tough work.
They gotta be right behind me.
Paws, don't fail me now.
Oh, no. Chance.
Hey, I saw
your f-f-f-friend, um...
Doggone it, Stokey. Quit scratchin'
when you're tryin' to talk.
Sorry, Sledge.
F-F-F-F-Fleas!
Dang. While
we're young, dog.
He went up the, uh,
south si... south si...
Chill! He went up
the south side alley.
Ah, precisely.
Yo, Delilah, come here.
Look, she knows the south side.
If anybody can find
your friend, she will.
Hope you can catch him.
He's fast.
Well, so am I.
Back in a flash.
Hey! Where'd Delilah go?
Get a grip, Bando. She just went
to find their friend.
- But she's my girlfriend.
- Yeah, right. Not in this lifetime.
Oh, that's rough. Ooh.
Yes, I did it.
I outfoxed them.
I mean, I out-dogged them.
I faced danger, and I sniffed its butt.
What a rush.
What excitement. What?
What am I standin'
around here for?
Whoa! Learn to drive, bozo!
Oh, excellent.
No doggy door.
Come on, Chance. Move.
Okay. Time to break out
the fancy moves.
This is crazy. What did that dog
eat for breakfast? Jet fuel?
Oh, this kid is fast,
but not fast enough. Cute butt.
Front leg cramp.
Back leg cramp.
Oh, man.
Now I need a decoy.
Right where I want ya.
Prepare to meet the Chancenator!
Okay, pal. Now you're toast.
My paws are lethal weapons, and I'm totally
rabid. You picked the wrong pooch to mess with.
Hey, hey, hey! Ow, ow, ow!
Not the neck! Not the neck!
Hey, hey! Back off!
Back off! You win!
- Lethal weapons, huh?
- You're a girl?
Yep. And now, tough guy,
you're all mine.
Oh, no. She's comin' in for the kill.
Come on, lady. I got a family.
Oh, boy. I don't see 'em.
And this neighborhood
makes me real nervous.
Yeah, I think we'll head home.
Too many humans around here.
But, Riley, we haven't found their friend
yet. We can't just leave him out there, right?
I won't leave Chance out there.
Oh, yeah? Well, I can't have my
whole gang out here Iookin' for one dog.
But what about my Delilah?
She's out there too.
Do you think
Delilah's found him?
What if she didn't find him? Or
worse, what if she did? Oh, no!
- Hi.
- Don't you " Hi" me.
First you chase me, then you try to kill
me, and then you kiss me. What's the game?
Game? I don't have a game.
Look, I was only chasing you...
because your friends back
in the alley asked me to, okay?
My friends, huh? So, tell me,
what are my friends' names?
- Shadow and Sassy.
- Hmph. Lucky guess.
Okay, show me
the secret paw shake.
Secret paw shake? T-They didn't
show me any secret paw shake.
Aha, they didn't, huh?
Good, 'cause there ain't one.
- Now, explain that kiss.
- Kiss? That was no kiss.
- Friendly lick maybe.
- Friendly? Boy, is that an understatement.
Okay, let's try this again.
I'm Delilah, Chance.
Delilah Chance? Wow, your last name
is the same as my first name.
Oh, boy.
Good thing you're cute.
Uh-oh, guys. Check it out.
It's the blood-red van!
Hide!
Oh, man! I knew we shouldn't
have been out here.
Yo, Shadow, Sassy.
Under here.
Blend in.
Think camouflage.
Oh, man, I hate this.
Hidin' under some car
like a... like a cat.
- I heard that.
- Oh, boy. That was really c-c-c-close.
Why are we hiding?
What do they want?
They want you, pet. Those humans will
snatch any dog off the street.
And once they take ya,
ya never come back.
Word is, they sell ya to a place
called the lab. And that sounds bad.
- What's so bad about a lab that takes dogs away?
- Hey!
- Don't push it, Sassy.
- All clear, y'all.
C-C-Cool!
Riley, you know
a lot about this city.
We need to cross a golden bridge.
Do you know where that is?
Yeah, I know where it is,
but I ain't goin' there.
See, a bridge means cars, and cars mean
the man, and we don't like the man.
Hear that, Sassy? Guess we'll have
to find that bridge on our own.
Why? To get back to your humans?
Face it. They don't want you.
You're wrong.
They do want us.
Come on, Shadow.
Let's get out of here.
- Riley, thanks for everything.
- Yeah, right. Thanks for nothing.
Risking your life for humans?
That's beyond stupidity.
- So long, pets.
- So long.
That Riley was no help.
He just doesn't understand how much
we care about Hope and Peter.
I even miss the one
who steps on me.
Oh, Sassy,
you really are homesick.
So now where exactly
are you from?
Uh, you know,
just over the bridge.
Oh, that's funny. I-I thought
your two pals said you were lost.
Listen, maybe those two are lost,
but I always know where I'm going...
Chance, are you okay?
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah,
I just did that for a laugh.
See, Delilah,
I have humor, grace and style.
Those are three qualities
you don't find in most dogs.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah, just checkin' out this hole.
Wouldn't want you to fall into it or
anything. Yeah, this is definitely a hole.
Okay, we can go.
Whoa, Chance. We really
should be heading back, huh?
- Aren't you anxious to get home?
- Hey, I'm not in a hurry.
Maybe you could show me around.
You know, show me the town.
Well, all right.
I guess I could play guide dog.
I'll show you my
favorite thing to do.
Does it involve food?
Meant to do that.
- Well, here we are.
- What's this?
I thought we were
goin' some place cool.
This is my favorite place
in the entire city.
- Really?
- Yeah. Isn't it beautiful?
Well, it's no Dumpster
behind McDonald's.
It's just that I get enough
of this back home.
And to tell you the truth, it
gets kind of dull after a while.
I mean, ponds and ducks
can only be so exciting.
Swim, quack, swim, quack!
Boring!
Oh, you. Come on.
I've dreamed of living
in a place like this.
But I guess that's
pretty silly, huh?
Are you crazy? You get to live in the
city. It's the coolest place in the world.
Chance, stay clear of those
humans. You can't trust 'em.
Come on. What's not to trust?
You're talkin' about the species...
that invented
the chili cheeseburger.
They are so tasty.
Jamie turned me onto 'em.
- Jamie? Who's Jamie?
- He's my human.
Well, Riley says you can't trust humans,
no matter how friendly they seem.
I'm pretty sure
I can trust Jamie.
He rescued me
from the bad place.
He takes me for walks. He lets me
eat off his plate. He gave me a home.
Let me tell you something.
When Riley was a puppy,
he thought he found a home
with humans too.
They tied a ribbon
to his collar.
And they put him in
a big basket underneath a tree.
But the little boy, he didn't
seem to like Riley very much.
He didn't want to hold him
or play with him or anything.
So later, they drove into
the city, and they left Riley...
in the gutter on the coldest,
rainiest night of the year.
So Riley found other abandoned dogs,
and he made a home for them...
to protect them from all humans.
They got rid of Riley just 'cause
the kid didn't want to play with him?
Huh. Jamie's gettin' tired
of playin' with me.
- Uh-oh.
- You don't think?
I don't know, Chance. All I know
is, I don't trust humans.
- And I don't know any dog that does.
- Why?
- What'd your humans do to you?
- Me? Oh, I never had humans.
I was born a stray.
Poor Delilah. No wonder she
doesn't trust humans. She never had any.
She doesn't know how great
it can be havin' a family.
Havin' somebody there
to look out for you.
Got ya!
Delilah, I...
W-W... Uh... Well, I...
I just wanted
to tell you that, uh...
- Well, here.
- Oh, Chance. You're sweet.
Yep, that's right. An American bulldog,
a Golden Retriever...
and a Himalayan cat.
Right. Right,
I talked to you last night.
Uh, no.
No reports so far, sir.
Look, what are the chances
of finding these animals?
Uh, realistically.
One in ten.
I mean, it's a big city out there. You
got cars and trucks, trains and trolleys.
There are animal science labs,
other strays.
You got your wackos. I mean,
there's a million things...
that can do major harm
to an animal in the city.
Lost animals and cities
just don't mix.
Okay, well,
thanks for your help.
Uh, look forward
to hearin' from ya.
Nothin' yet, but, um,
he's hopeful.
Better hurry,
if we're gonna catch that plane.
Hey, this place smells great.
Let's check it out.
- But there are too many humans.
- Yeah, and humans mean food.
- But Riley says...
- Ah, Riley, schmiley.
Today you're with Chance. Come on.
Do you have any idea what's out there?
Leftover pizza crust, melting
sno-cones, half-eaten corn dogs.
- What's a corn dog?
- Delilah, babe, you have so much to learn.
Okay, the first thing I'm gonna teach
you is the proper method for begging.
Now, what you gotta remember is,
it's all in the eyes.
See, the objective is to look
cute, but be as sad as possible.
Oh, and don't drool.
Never drool. They hate that.
Okay, comin' through. Comin'
through. Dog on a date here.
Excuse me. Watch your step.
Oh. Oh. Score!
Oh, Chance, you can't take it
from him. He's just a pup.
What? All right.
I'll guess you're right.
Hey, enjoy your lunch, kid.
It's your lucky day.
- Oh, Delilah, you're gonna love this.
- What is it?
- Wow!
- Hey, guys! What's up?
Delilah, I've heard about this. This is what
happens when dogs stay in the water too long.
All your fur comes off. That's why
you should always put up a fight...
if someone tries
to give you a bath.
Thanks. I'll remember that.
So, Chance, what do you think?
You know, I think this is quite possibly
the most absolutely greatest day of my life.
See? Aren't ya glad
I caught ya?
Get outta here.
I let you catch me.
Let me? Okay, doggy-noogie.
Ow. Hey, easy on the do.
Hey, Jack, what is it
with people and their dogs?
The only good dog is a hot dog.
Hey! Will ya quiet down
back there?
Buddy, take it easy.
Take it easy on 'em.
Dogs. I'd kill 'em
if they weren't worth so much.
Let's roll, Ralph.
We ain't gettin' nothin'
sittin' around here.
Who says I'm too old
for stuffed animals?
- Hey, boss, I got somethin'.
- Yeah? Too bad there's no cure.
Look at this. This must be the biggest
bone I ever seen in my life.
- Hey, let me see that.
- It must be from a horse or a rhinoceros.
- Or a prehistoric mastodon.
- Good job, Pete.
- You found my bone.
- Your bone, boss?
- Sure, I hid it here yesterday.
- Man, just my luck.
You know what. I think
I hear somebody comin'.
- Why don't you go check it out?
- All right.
Sucker.
Yo, boss. You was right.
There is somebody comin'.
- It's those two pets from the alley.
- The pets? Hey!
- Let me see. Hold still.
- Boss!
- I'm gonna jump 'em.
- You gotta lose some weight. You're heavy.
- Who asked ya, tubby?
- It's because you eat between meals, you know, pal.
- I mean, that's the way I figure it.
- Shut up, and hold still!
- Boss, I can't hold you.
- Quit squirmin', Pete.
- Pete!
- But it hurts!
Pete! You idiot!
Okay, now, wait 'til they pass a hole
in the fence, then you'll jump 'em.
- So, you'll jump 'em.
- No, you'll jump 'em.
- That's what I said. You'll jump 'em.
- No, Pete! You'll jump 'em!
- Wait a minute. So who's jumpin' 'em?
- Oh, great! You missed 'em!
- You missed 'em?
- Aw, shut up.
Uh-oh, this doesn't look good.
Sassy, that little boy
lives here.
- Tucker!
- Give me the divider! Run the hose!
- Tucker!
- Tucker!
- Please! Oh, Tucker!
- We're working on an entry, ma'am. My men are going in.
I need two lines on the south side.
Let's go! Come on! Let's go!
- The boy! He's inside.
- Oh, Shadow! How awful.
Tucker!
- I'm going in!
- What?
- Shadow, no!
- ...a crew on the back door.
I want them in there now!
You see that? That fool Shadow's
gonna get himself killed!
And for a human?
It doesn't make any sense.
Tucker! Where are you?
I've gotta help him. Oh, my.
- Now the cat's going in.
- What's wrong with these pets?
Sassy to the rescue.
What am I doing?
Watch out! Live wire!
North side! Live wire!
Shadow?
- Tucker! - Mommy!
- Don't be afraid.
I'm here to help you. See?
All right, look. Look, Tucker.
Tucker, I'm your friend.
You're safe with me.
- That's it. Hurry!
- Mommy!
- He's out! Tucker!
- Stay back! Stay back!
He's out! The boy's out!
Clear the house!
Clear the house!
- Okay.
- He's got him. He's okay!
Okay. I need two lines
on the porch!
I need two lines
on the porch now!
- Are you okay? - Oh, sweetie.
- Tiger's in there.
- Forget it, man. It's gone!
- Dump it in! Dump it in!
Shadow, over here!
Yo, Shadow. You the dog!
You the dog!
Yeah, you're pretty brave.
I mean, for a-a-a-a pet.
Brave, huh? Let me
ask you something.
- You think a human would've done that for you?
- My boy Peter would.
Hey, you're, uh, cat friend's
still in there.
I mean, uh, I sure hope,
she's, uh, okay.
Sassy's inside?
Okay, bring that up!
Yeah, bring it up!
Somebody please get this little
pipsqueak out of my mouth.
- Tiger!
- I'm singed, and I smell like an ashtray.
- Tiger!
- She made it! She's out!
Whoa, that is one bad cat!
- Thanks, kitty.
- " Thanks"? That's it?
No tuna? No milk? No catnip?
- Thank goodness.
- You saved Tiger.
- Sassy, you amaze me.
- Hey, I'm a cat.
And you saved my life. Thanks.
You're welcome, Tucker.
A dog is a boy's best friend.
Come on, Sassy! Let's go.
Where are you going?
Maybe they're going home, son.
Hey, you guys, you're all right.
Well, let's head on home, gang. You
know, you two are welcome to hang with us.
Uh, gee, are you sure
pets are allowed?
I think this time
we can make an exception.
Well, this is it.
Home, sweet home.
Hey, it's nothing fancy, but the price
is right and nobody bothers us.
- So you guys can stay as long as you like.
- Thanks, Riley.
- You're very kind.
- Right. If he's so kind,
why doesn't he help us
find that bridge?
We can't leave
until we find Chance.
- Why not?
- You know you miss him.
Okay, I miss his stupid jokes
and his stupid face...
and his stupid stupidness.
Oh, Sassy, stop it.
And I'm stupidly starting
to worry about him.
- What... What in the world is going on...
- Ooh! Check it out.
Chance and Delilah
sniffing at a tree
- K-I-S-S... - Chill out, Sledge.
- Hey, guys.
- Where you been?
- Chance! - Let me at him.
I'm gonna use his nose
as a scratch post.
- We've looked everywhere for you.
- Well, here I am.
Ew! And they were probably
kissing and stuff. Gross!
Dee, you go, girl!
Looks like he got it goin' on.
No way! He's all b-b-b-b...
B-b-b... b-b-b... b-b-b-bark...
- and no b-b-b-b-b...
- Oh, here we go.
- B-b-b... b-b-b... b-b-b...
- Bite, fool.
- Exactly.
- But, Delilah, I thought... What about me?
- Who are you?
- I'm her... I mean, I was gonna be her...
Aw, Bando, face it. You ain't
nothin' but a hound dog.
Bando, I told you,
you and I are just friends.
Huh? But, Delilah...
- What? Catch a clue, Opie.
- Why, you little...
- Maybe someone should take you for a walk, pal.
- Bando, knock it off!
Ah, sorry, Riley. I wasn't
tryin' to start somethin'.
I'm done. I'm calm.
Stupid lost dog comes along
trying to steal my woman.
- Home wrecker.
- What's up with this, girl? I know you can't be serious.
- But, Riley...
- But nothing, Delilah. The dude's a pet.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Come on, Chance. We don't need to take this.
I should've known
they wouldn't understand.
- Shadow, we got us a problem.
- Yep.
Oh, that Riley's
got a lot of nerve.
I mean, I can't believe
he called you a pet.
But I am a pet.
Yeah, but I... I know
you're more than that.
I mean... I mean, look how much fun
you've been having today in the city.
- It's... It's almost like you're...
- Like what?
Like you're a natural,
a city dog.
- Yeah, I feel that too.
- We had fun today. We could have fun tomorrow.
Tomorrow's wide open for me.
- So that's a yes?
- Totally.
Oh, wow, Delilah,
this is gonna be great.
You and me, together
in the city. Forget about it.
- Oh, but...
- What? What's wrong?
- Well, it's Jamie.
- What about him?
If I stay here, what's
gonna happen to him?
You said yourself he hasn't
had time for you lately.
Well, yeah, but I still
kind of miss him.
Well, I can't tell you
what to do, Chance.
All I know is I never
really felt this way before.
Me either. I wanted to say
the same thing to you all day,
but then I thought you'd laugh at me,
and then I'd really feel like a dork.
- Geez, you are laughing at me.
- No, I'm laughing with you.
I knew that.
Okay. Thanks.
Due to the weather conditions,
all arrivals and departures...
are indefinitely delayed.
Thank you for your patience.
Okay, Mom, let's just say
I was worried about Chance.
Think I'll ever see him again?
Oh, honey, they found
their way home once before.
They can do it again.
I hope so.
I'm really sorry for being
such a big jerk lately.
- Oh! Go to sleep, sweetie.
- Okay.
We'll be home soon.
Oh, a bath! A facial!
- A dog? Oh!
- Huh?
You're the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.
Yeah? Well, that's not what
you said last night, toots.
Oh, I feel faint. Ugh!
He... Hey, Delilah,
get a load of that. It's a doughnut!
It's a big rubber do...
No, it's a throne!
It's the doughnut throne!
Hey, I'm the doughnut king!
Yo, this brother's trippin'.
He's kinda cute, though.
Give me your... your glazed, your jelly,
your cinnamon crullers,
- yearning to be dunked, eaten...
- Shadow, what you did back at that fire,
well, that was
pretty righteous, man.
So, if humans mean that much to you,
I'll take you out to the bridge.
That's great, Riley.
Now I just have to get
Chance to come along.
I was wrong. This isn't a throne.
It's the world's biggest chew toy.
- Chance, we should probably head back in.
- Heads up!
Air raid, 2:00!
Delilah, cover my wing!
Assume attack formation.
Take that! Ha!
Whoa, spoils of war!
Delilah, come here.
Get your share.
- Hello, Delilah.
- Oh, hi.
- I need to talk to you about Chance.
- Oh?
He's not like you. He's not
like any of the other strays.
- Yeah, I know he's different.
- You have to let him go.
Let him go?
What are you talking about?
He doesn't have what it takes to survive
in the city. Everything's a game to him.
- But I can take care of him.
- This is a dangerous place, Delilah.
You won't always be able
to be there for him.
You know, you're starting to sound like
Riley. I said, I can take care of him.
Well, I hope you're right,
for his sake.
You know, you could've been a contender,
but look at you. You're a bag of trash.
You're a disgrace.
Ding, ding, ding, ding!
And at the start of round two,
the garbage is starting to fight back.
Chance is up against the ropes,
but he ducks. He gives a left!
What are you doing?
- He won't let go!
- Oh, no! It's the blood-red van!
- Chance, come on.
- Everybody run!
Quick, hide!
Hurry! Upstairs!
Uh-oh.
Mmm! Wow, that was
worth fighting for. Mmm.
Chance? Guys, is Chance
up here? Oh, no!
Shadow, those men
are gonna get Chance.
Wait a minute.
Do I smell a cheeseburger?
All right, come out
with your buns up.
- All right, Jack, here it is.
- Oh, no, Ralph.
- This is your moment in the spotlight.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- I don't know.
Just look at him, Ralph. A big,
juicy cherry just waiting to be plucked.
- Turn around. Turn around!
- I'm so sorry. I thought he was right behind me.
- Chance, run.
- He's a goner.
Where is it? Hey!
- Hey, buddy.
- Who are you guys?
Wanna go on a ride? Wanna go
on a ride with us, doggy?
We got a lot of nice
other dogs in there.
- Ah, big boy has the burger.
- And they called me stupid.
- Jack, this ain't workin'.
- Shh! Stay. Stay.
- What a handsome young man we are.
- Who?
- Yes, I'm talkin' to you.
- Me?
Is our young man hungry today?
Can we interest him
in a little snackie-poo?
Oh, a cheeseburger!
Oh, lemme at it! Lemme at it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
What are you doin'?
- Let's go!
- Hurry!
Throw him in the back with the rest
of 'em and let's get outta here.
Hey, you know, this isn't
funny anymore. Shadow!
- Shadow!
- Hold on, Chance. We're comin' for ya.
Lemme at 'em. Lemme at 'em!
- Move, move, move!
- Got a live one here.
- Come on. Here we go.
- Get him. Get him. - Look, you guys.
Wh-Whoever you are,
I think you got the wrong dog.
I-I'm somebody's pet! I got a home!
Where are you taking me?
- Stay in there, you guys.
- Not the bad place!
Chance, please hang on.
Wait a minute. Stop!
Don't put me in there!
- I don't wanna go in there!
- There we go. Come on. Up. There we go.
Get in there, you.
Ow! Ow! Help! Somebody, help!
I don't wanna go!
Help! Lemme out! Help!
- I don't think we're gonna make it!
- We will. We have to.
Shadow! Delilah! Help!
They've got him! Oh, Shadow,
I should've listened to you.
- Shadow!
- Come on, posse. We'll cut 'em off at the pass.
Okay, everybody, listen up. We can stop 'em,
but we got to figure a way to get Chance out.
Uh, excuse me,
but the cat has a plan.
You know where you're
goin', don't ya?
You're goin' to the lab,
my friend.
They're gonna wire you up
like a freakin' Christmas tree.
What's goin' on?
You'd almost think they're tryin' t...
Tryin' to stop us here.
- Heh! I'd like to see 'em try.
- Okay, get ready, Sassy.
Shadow, I was born ready.
Run 'em over.
Jack.
Jack, that's about another
hundred dollars worth of dog out there.
Don't you understand
what's happening here, Ralph?
- They're turnin' against us.
- What?
We gotta show 'em who's boss.
We gotta run 'em down
like the dogs they are.
Jack, I ca... I can't do that.
Show 'em, Ralph!
Show 'em who's boss!
Jack, get a hold of yourself!
Hold your ground! Don't move!
Scaring me!
Jack! Jack!
- They're nuts!
- Everybody, stay!
- Uh-oh.
- Steady.
- Run 'em over. Flatten 'em, Ralph!
- Jack! Jack!
Jack! Jack!
- Scatter!
- Chance!
Pull yoursel... Oh!
- Delilah, move!
- Get off! Stop it!
- My paw.
- Delilah?
You hurt Delilah?
All right, now it's personal!
- Okay, Sassy, now.
- It's Kung Fu Kitty. Meow!
Bad human! Bad human!
I'll rip you limb from limb,
you fussin', rustlin',
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!
- Bad-tastin', dognappin' scallawag!
- Let's go!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Now! - Let's get 'em!
- Yo, I got dibs on chubby!
- I don't want this job anymore, Jack.
- Stay. Stay, doggies.
- Nice, nice doggies.
- Hey, buddy.
Whoo-hoo! Chance!
Sassy! I've never been
happier to see you.
- Please?
- Show them your teeth.
- They hate that.
- How's this?
Nice doggy. Nice doggy.
- Go! - I got this one, Riley!
- This one's mine.
Yeah, you better run,
'cause I'm on your heels.
- Hey!
- I got you, chump! You goin' down! Uh!
- Where you goin'? Check this out.
- Hey!
That's what I call a mouthful!
- Nobody takes dogs from Mr. Riley's neighborhood.
- Get off!
- Hey, get off! Get off! Hey!
- Not so tough now, are you, Mr. Blood-Red Van!
Before I set you free, say it.
Not in front of the guys.
Okay, cats rule.
- I can't hear you.
- All right. Cats rule!
- Back off, you... Back off!
- Hey, Sledge, havin' fun?
Oh, you know it! We should've done this
a long time ago! Unh!
Bingo. Going down.
Please watch your step,
and thank you for choosing
the blood-red van.
We are outta here! Okay!
Hey, you guys know I was kidding.
I don't really think cats rule.
- Bad dog! Bad dog! Bad dog!
- Hey, guys, have a bite.
- Let's get outta here!
- Get off!
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yes! We're
talkin' payback time, baby.
Run, Ralph! Run!
No!
- Ow! Down, boy! Down! Down, boy!
- Hey, get down! Aah!
Time to get rid of
this thing for good!
Yee-haw!
- That was slick, hound!
- Yeah, Bando, way to go!
Beautiful! Beautiful, Bando.
- There it goes.
- See ya, blood-red van.
Hey, gang, we did
ourselves proud today.
- Go on, get outta here!
- Hasta Ia vista, baby.
- Delilah, how's your paw?
- Oh, it's fine, Bando.
- Thanks.
- What? What happened to your paw?
You hush up. You nearly got us
killed. Why don't you beat it?
- Beat it?
- Oh, Chance, he's right. You don't belong here in the city.
- Delilah, what are you saying?
- It was fun while it lasted.
- Mm-hmm.
- But let's face it. Y-You're a pet.
What? You're not serious.
She is serious, about me.
So get lost.
I don't believe this.
Good-bye, Delilah.
Chance, wait!
Just leave me alone, old-timer.
I don't need you,
or Sassy, or her.
I don't need anybody.
I'm outta here.
You had to let him go.
It was the best thing to do.
Yeah? Then why do I feel so bad?
I'd always heard love hurts.
I never knew it could
hurt this much.
It was like getting a bath,
missing dinner and going to the vet...
all rolled into one.
I tell you, I was one sad puppy.
Sorry, Shadow. I had the whole
gang out Iookin' for him.
The dog is just not around. But if you want
to go to the bridge, we have to leave now.
But I just can't leave him here.
But, Shadow, we can't just
keep staying here either.
- Think about Hope. Think about Peter.
- Well, I do miss Peter.
- Is that a yes?
- Believe me, that's as close to a yes as you'll ever get.
Okay, then,
let's shake some booty!
As James Brown would say, we're
headin' to the bridge, hey!
Good-bye, Delilah. I'm sorry.
- Come on, you two, keep it moving.
- Pick it up a little, Sassy.
Oh, do you think he even
knows where the bridge is?
He knows. He said
we'd be there by sunup.
If you can't find the bridge from here,
well, you're in more trouble than I thought.
I guess we can find it, Riley.
So, this is it.
No, really? You mean, you're not
gonna visit the city every weekend?
Oh, I've had enough
city life, thank you.
Well, if you're ever in the
neighborhood, drop by, but do call first.
- Good-bye, Riley.
- So long, Sassy.
- You know, she's kinda fine for a feline.
- Uh-huh! You know it!
Bye, Riley. Wait up, Sassy!
Yo! House pet.
I'll keep in mind
what you said, about humans.
Riley, you're all right.
Right back at ya.
Home, home in the 'burbs
Where the cat and
the squeak toy can play
Come on, Shadow, sing along.
Where no traffic is heard
And I can maul birds
And sleep in the sunshine
all day
Home, home...
Shadow, what is the matter?
Aren't you excited?
I just can't leave Chance behind.
Home won't be the same.
- Exactly.
- Sassy, we can't cross the bridge without him.
Oh, you're right.
Drat, we were so close!
Then it's settled.
We're goin' back.
- Surprise, Goldie!
- Oh, no!
Well, well, if it
isn't our pet pals.
Back off, Ashcan.
We don't want to fight.
Don't want to fight? You're not so
tough without your buddy Riley around.
- We're just trying to get home. So I'll ask you again...
- Shadow, be careful.
- Back off, both of you.
- You ain't the one I want, Gramps.
- I'm outta here. - Go to it, Pete.
- I'm on it, boss.
Smart cat versus dumb dog,
round two. Ding!
But this time, you can't drop
something on my head.
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Hey, cat, your friend's a goner.
I've seen Ashcan kill a dog
just for stepping on his tail.
Sassy, go!
See if you can find help.
See?
Oh, my! Oh, my!
Yee-haw!
Yes, it's a thing of beauty
when Chance is on duty.
Hiya, stinky.
Long time no smell.
- Stinky?
- Get him!
- Yeah, let's get 'im.
- This is gonna be good.
I'm right behind him, boss.
Follow me, chuckleheads.
And goin' up.
And down. Think you
can handle that one?
Let me at 'im!
Let me at 'im!
- Hey, boss, wait up! Wait for me!
- Ha, ha! The old seesaw trick.
What the...
- Pete, get your stupid paws off the board!
- Oh, sorry, boss.
Idiot.
Okay, now where'd
that little punk go?
He went this way, boss.
Follow me.
Come on, kids, keep up!
I call this the Stairmaster.
Come on!
Boy, we gotta exercise
a little more.
This is tough. Oh, water.
I need some water.
All right, pet, where are ya?
Hey, losers! You Iookin' for me?
Move your tail, Pete! What
are you waiting for? Get him!
Hey, what's got eight legs, no brains,
spins around and screams like a baby?
- Uh, I don't know. What? Whoa!
- You guys!
- This is all your fault.
- This is all your fault? - Aw, shut up!
- Hey, guys! You miss me?
- Well, I can't speak for Sassy.
Of course I did.
Chance, you saved our lives!
- Ah, piece of cake.
- I'm sure one day I'll regret saying this, but thank you.
And what took you so long?
You know, you worry too much. I've been
trailing you ever since you left Riley's.
I knew we could count
on you, Chance.
So, my dynamic dog duo,
let's all go home.
- Absolutely!
- Yeah, that's assuming I still have a home.
- Don't be ridiculous. Your home's with us.
- And with Jamie.
He must be worried sick
about you.
Or just plain sick of me.
- It's Riley!
- He's back.
Dang, woman, look at you, sitting here
like your tail won't ever wag again.
Riley, I feel terrible. How could I
have said those things to Chance?
You did what you had to,
Delilah. It was for the best.
Was it? Was it really?
Delilah, listen. You're street,
and, and he's not.
I'm sorry, but that's
just the way it is.
I know, but I miss him.
- Hurry, Dad, hurry!
- Kids,
I want the animals to be home as much
as you do, but they might not be.
Dad, they made it.
I just know they did.
Guys, we're almost home.
I can smell it.
Hope, start warming up
some milk.
I want you both to know, once we
get back, I'm never going outside again.
In fact, I may never even leave my bed.
Oh, bed, bed, bed!
Okay, I know I've
said this before, but...
Yeah, we know, " home is
just over this hill." Right!
I left my heart
In San Francisco
I can definitely
get us back from here.
It looks like one of us
isn't quite ready to go.
Hurry, Chance!
You don't wanna miss dinner.
- It's amazing. I mention food, and he doesn't even move.
- Poor pup.
Well, Delilah, I guess
this is really good-bye.
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Yes, in time.
Hurry, Dad, hurry!
- Sassy, do you hear a truck?
- No, Shadow, I see a truck!
- Chance, look out!
- Chance!
- Is everybody okay? - Yeah.
- Yeah. That was close.
- Dad, Dad, what happened?
- I don't know. Must've been an accident or something.
- Shadow?
- You guys wait here.
- Look, it's Shadow!
- And it's Sassy! I see Sassy!
- Sassy! - Hey, kids, wait!
- Bob, they made it!
- Shadow!
- Sassy!
- Shadow! - Peter!
- I knew you'd make it, boy.
- Hope! - Hi, Shadow.
- Are you all right?
How did you do it?
How did you do it?
- Chance! Come here, boy!
- Chance.
- Shadow, did he make it?
- Chance!
- I am really sorry. Is everybody okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.
- But what happened?
- Oh, there was this crazy dog right in the road.
- I-I-I tried to stop, but these rigs just don't stop that fast.
- Chance!
- Chance!
- Chance!
- Chance!
- Honey, honey, why don't you go talk to the trucker.
Chance.
Jamie, wait, wait! Jamie.
Where's Chance?
Where's Chance, Dad?
Where's my dog?
Jamie, the reason the trucker...
The reason he put on his brakes
so quickly was...
There was a dog
in the middle of the road.
Oh. No!
- Jamie, wait!
- Where's Chance? Please!
- Jamie! - Chance?
- Jamie.
- Chance!
- Jamie?
Jamie, is that you? What am I...
What am I talking about?
Of course it's you! It's...
Is it... It's really you!
- I found you! I found my boy!
- You made it! You made it!
I found my Jamie!
Oh, I'm so happy!
Oh, I could just lick you
for days. Give me a hug!
- Give me a hug! - Chance!
- Oh, that's great!
- Good boy! Oh!
- Oh, Chance!
I'm so glad you're alive.
It's so good to see you again.
- And I love you, Chance.
- I can't believe an... I thought I'd never see you again.
I'm so sorry I was mean to you.
I love you, Chance.
I love you, too, man!
Hey, Chance, come on, let's go!
- Hey, Chance, come on!
- It's okay. You go ahead without me.
Come on, buddy.
- What's wrong with ya?
- It's called heartbreak, kid.
Chance, let's go to the park.
I hate to say it, but I'm
starting to miss the old Chance.
Hey, Dad, there's something
wrong with Chance.
I mean, he's sick or something.
Well, he's tired, son. He'll be fine
when he gets all rested up.
Thank you, Dr. Bob.
Hey, Shadow, come on.
Come on, let's play.
Frisbee! All right! Let her fly!
Come on. You got it. Come on.
- Sassy, not on the table.
- Well, I guess the honeymoon's over, huh?
Oh, honey, he'll be okay.
I know that bark. That's...
- What is it, Chance?
- Nah, it couldn't be.
It couldn't be, could it?
Snap out of it, Chance.
Snap out of it.
Well, come on, kids.
We got a ball game to get to,
and lunch is gonna be here
any minute, so let's get go...
Hey, Jamie.
Let's give Chance a little time
by himself, okay?
Okay.
Aw, stop it.
You're cracking up, Chance.
You need a break, old buddy.
You gotta take a little time.
You'll see, after a while
you're gonna forget all about...
Delilah?
Oh, Chance. I've missed you.
Delilah, how did you find me?
I followed my nose, Chance,
and my heart.
- I'm so sorry.
- You are? Really?
Chance, you're my man.
- Delilah!
- Chance!
- I can't believe you're here!
- I can't believe it either!
Oh, boy, are you a smell
for a sore nose.
Oh, Chance, I've
missed you so much.
Chance?
I'm sorry I called you a pet.
I just... I thought...
- Oh, who cares? I love you, Chance.
- I love you, Delilah.
- Man, look at that pretty dog.
- Honey?
Chance, your home is so beautiful.
It's even prettier than the park.
Not nearly as pretty as you.
It's all right.
I think Chance knows her.
Oh, yeah, he knows her. I wonder
how long she'll stick around this time.
Sassy, look at 'em. She came
all this way. She must love him.
- This is the coolest day of my whole life.
- Mine too.
Oh, I feel like
I could fly! Or not.
Oh, Delilah, I... Oh.
Hi, everybody.
Looks like Chance found himself
a girlfriend while we were away.
- Oh!
- He's happy again, Dad.
- Are these your humans?
- Yeah.
Not a bad-looking bunch,
if you don't count the cat.
- Is that Jamie?
- Yep.
That's the Jamester.
Come on. I want you to meet him.
Let Jamie show you what
humans are really like.
Oh, I don't know, Chance.
What if he doesn't like me?
He will. He likes Sassy,
for crying out loud.
- I heard that.
- Besides, Jamie's my best friend.
Jamie, I'd like you to meet
Delilah. Delilah, this is Jamie.
- Hi, girl.
- Let him pet you, and give him a nice kiss.
- Do you think he likes me?
- Are you kidding? What's not to like?
- Pretty girl.
- Come on, meet Delilah, everybody.
- Wow, what a cool-looking dog.
- What kind of dog is she?
- Hi! Oh, isn't she sweet!
- They like her!
- All right! This is Iookin' good.
- She's so pretty.
- Sure is. - Thank you.
- She doesn't have a collar.
- Must be a stray.
- Can she stay, Dad?
Yeah, can she, Dad?
Can she, Dad?
Daddy! You don't mind me calling
you Daddy, do ya? Please!
- Oh.
- Can she, Dad?
I don't want Chance
to be sad again.
Aw, come on! Look at her!
Look at her! She's so cute!
How can you not wanna
keep this dog? Please!
- Yeah, she can stay.
- Yes!
Oh! I don't think Chance
would have it any other way.
He's back!
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!
- Okay, come on.
- Welcome to the family, girl.
You're gonna like it here.
- Wow, Delilah with Jamie.
- Hey, girl.
I can't believe how lucky I am.
Now my home's
the best of both worlds,
and I never want to be
away from it again.
- Hi.
- Oh, isn't she pretty.
There's only one thing that could
make this moment more perfect.
In fact, I think I smell it
coming up the driveway right now.
I'm smellin' pepperoni.
I'm smellin' mushrooms.
I'm smellin' anchovies.
I'm smelling three... No, no,
four, four kinds of cheese!
It could be!
It might be. It is!
It's pizza!
- Oh, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!
- Oh-ho! Nice doggy. Nice...
- Whoa!
- Yes! Hey, pizza guy!
- Whoa! Stay! Whoa! Whoa! Stay!
- Nice timing! I love pizza.
- Stay down! Stay down! Whoa!
- I must have pizza. I will have pizza.
- Whoa, doggy! Stay!
- Hand it over nicely, or I can take it,
- but either way, pal, that pizza...
- Stay down! Whoa! Whoa!
Is mine!
Yippee! Oh, pizza! Oh!
- Chance, stop!
- Oh, this is hot.
Hot, hot, hot, hot. Come on,
Jamie, Delilah, everybody.
Come on! There's plenty
for everybody.
Oh, what a day!
Oh, this is so good!
You know, I can't think
of a happier ending.
