January 26, 1982.
AMAYO: Did you receive integrity
training at the academy?
Some, yes.
What do you mean by some?
We had visits from
Internal Affairs officers.
The life in the academy is...

(CHALK TAPPING)
It was a building time,
a time to build a camaraderie
with the... with the guy

Not at all.
I recall having Internal Affairs
giving a lesson to the class.
And after

looked at us and said,
"Now, you can go that way,

You want to be a successful cop,
you don't go that way."

Mr. Dowd,
in your experiences
in your first year,
did you come to learn
what it meant
for a police officer
to be "good"?
Yes.
Could you tell
the commissioners and the public

in the police jargon
as you know it?
Well, being good is a cop that
would never give up another cop.
A cop that if, uh,
he witnesses something go down,
he's... he's 100% behind
anything a cop does,
no matter what it is.

You know, through a... we met a...
We had a very strong

His name was Mr. Perez.
(SMOOTH GUITAR MUSIC)
I'm driving up Van Siclen,
and on my right-hand side,
I see this very attractive
Hispanic woman...
very slender, red pump heels on,
long black, flowing hair...
standing next to a shiny,
beautiful red Corvette.
Immediately I was, of course,
drawn to this scene.
You know, a beautiful woman
standing next
to a beautiful car.
I mean, how perfect
could it get?
I had my Corvette
parked outside,
which was my showroom car.
My wife was there
cleaning the car, and...
police car stopped
right in front of my shop.
This dark-skinned Dominican guy
that looked like a string bean
with long braided hair
that came down

and said,
"Hey, Officer,
what can I do for you?"
I went, I say,
"Hey, my name is Baron."
He's like, "I don't give a fuck

He kept looking at my wife.

He goes to me, "What girl?"
I says, "This beautiful girl

She's beautiful."
He said, "That's my wife."
So in total disbelief, I said,
"Get the fuck out of here.
That's not your wife."
"My man, it's taken.
That's my wife."
And I said, "Holy fuck,
I can't believe that would...
Wow, you must be something."

Baron Perez was the owner
of a stereo installation shop.
PEREZ:
Auto Sound City.
In the front,
it had a little store
where they sell
all the equipment,
and in the back
was the shop we'd use
to do all the repairs
and installation.
Drug dealers
are the ones with money.
They want 18 speakers
and stereos
and all types of stuff.
More they could put in the car,
the better.
So it's obvious that he has
connections to drug dealers.
I know his clients
are drug dealers.
He knows that I know
his clients are drug dealers.
He knows that I know
he's a player.
He doesn't know how much
of a player I am at this point,
but he sees the glee in my eye.
I looked at him in the eye.
He looked at me in eye.
We made an agreement as friends.
So here I am.
I happen across this individual
running a proprietorship
with nothing but drug money
coming in and out
of the place all day long.
Maybe there's some way
we can make money from this.
La Compania is a very serious
Dominican gang.
They made a lot of money.
Millions and millions
of dollars.
La Compania was one of the most
powerful drug organizations
at that time in New York City.
José Montalvo,
also known as Chelo,
was the original leader
of the Compania
and was responsible
for its operation.
Me and my partner
are working on the drug side
of Chelo's organization.
Joe Hall and his partner
are working on the murder side
of Chelo's organization.
I have a large
carton of homicides
that I can attribute
to La Compania.
TROSTER: Chelo saw
himself as a businessman.
The Company was set up
very much like a business.
They had supervisors.
They had workers.
They had runners.
Runners would take the drugs
from the Heights
over to East New York,
put it in a stash house.
Then they had
the manufacturing part,
where they had to heat seal
jumbo 20s for distribution.
Their shifts matched
the police shifts,
so if a shift for a police
officer was 8:00 to 4:00,
then his shift at his spot
was 8:00 to 4:00.
For Chelo, it meant when
his vulnerability was highest,
the police presence
was lowest in the precinct.
(SIREN WAILING)
The only aspect of it
that made it
a little different
than a business is if...
In a business, if you mess up,
you get a reprimand.
In his business, if you mess up,
you got killed.
PEREZ: Chelo was not
intimidating to look at,
but he has this darkness,
you know?
He was a brutal guy.
He didn't think about it
to have somebody killed.
He killed a lot of people.
TROSTER:
The Company was very violent.
I mean, there were
murders of people
who were trying to rob them
for the money
that was in the spot.
There were murders of people
who were in the Company
who they perceived as a threat.
There were murders of rivals.
They brought people specifically
from the Dominican Republic
to work in New York,
whose only job
was to kill people
they saw as a threat.
HALL:
Just by the murders alone,
we knew we were
up against a tough...
a really tough crew...
really tough crew.
The time is now
approximately 1840 hours.
We are conducting
this video surveillance
for the Brooklyn North
Narcotics area office.
My investigation,
the La Compania investigation,
was two locations
in East New York...
Pine and Pitkin
and Norwood and Fulton.
Early on in the investigation,
we received information
about Chelo,
that he was going to be
at Norwood and Fulton Street.
I had borrowed a, uh, very
nondescript surveillance van.
And we were right in front
of the Pichardo Restaurant
where we knew members
of the organization
would hang out,
the bosses would hang out.
Tom and I are in the van,
and we're comfortable;
we're having our coffee.
And then slowly we start
to see people show up.
So Tom, being a DEA agent,
he starts taking the shots.
(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING)
And we're pretty excited,
because we know
that everybody showing up
is a part of Chelo's crew.
And we said, "Well,
we'll be able to identify
"who this person is,
this person is,
this person is,"
'cause at that point,
we had cooperators
that would point to us...
"This is so-and-so;
this is so-and-so."
So we're saying,
"This is great."
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Time goes by, and I kind of,
like, look over,
and I saw a quick glance.
I'm giving it
a little bit more time,
but I'm getting
the heebie-jeebies.
I'm saying, "Something's up,
the way they're looking at us."
I said, "Tom, that's enough.
Wrap it up.
We got everybody."
As I start the van, vroom,
of course they know no one's
come in and out of that van,
and they've had their eye on it.
And I hear, "Mira! Mira!"
And then I see a guy walk over
and pop the trunk
of a blue Chevelle.
The back comes up,
and they start reaching in,
and they start
bringing out hardware.
I saw about maybe
four or five guns
come out of the trunk
of that car.
And I see
a fucking street sweeper
come out of the trunk
of the car.
And I said,
"Oh, my God, this is it.
We're fucked."
I had my little five-shot,
Tom had his nine,
but we were fucking...
we were sitting in there
like we were in a, you know...
like fish in a barrel.
And as they start
to bring out the hardware,
I get the car around in time.
As we pulled out,
two rounds were fired.
So now I'm really
flying out of there.
And I'm looking at the rearview
mirror, of course,
and I see the two headlights,
and then I...
Vroom, they start
flying towards us.
So now I go, "Fuck."
They are absolutely in pursuit.
I put over the radio,
"Seven Five squad,
I got shots fired, Central.
We're being pursued by two
vehicles at Logan and Fulton."
Central calls back,
and she said,
"Give me a description
of the car you're chasing."
I said, "Negative."
I said, "They're chasing us."

Lot of plannings
for the robberies would begin
with me and Mike talking
about it in the patrol car.
"Talked to Adam.
Adam wants us to hit this spot.
How do you think
we should find out about it?"
We throw ideas back and forth.
"Uh, let's send Chicky in."
We all meet in a certain place,
in a certain bar,
and we figure out
what we wanted to do
and what we had heard
and what we had saw, and...
We started to get the reports
from wherever
Narcotics had been.
If Narcotics went
to a building or a location,
we would start
to stake out the location.
Tried to figure out, okay,
when the money was coming in,
when it was going out,
who was coming in,
who was going out.
Who's the same guy
we keep seeing all the time?
Pull him over.
Pat him down.
"I see you here all the time.
What are you doing here?"
"Oh, no."
"It says you live in Queens.
This is Brooklyn.
"What are you doing?
You visiting somebody?
"There's not a house
around for blocks.
What are you doing?"
Stuff like that.
We would check it out first,
hit it later.
Mike had a friend
in the police precinct.
Tall guy...
his fucking hands are like
three of my hands.
Uh, yeah, Walter.
Fucking big guy, huge guy.
Motherfucker's big.
Walter's a madman.
Just straight-up adrenaline.
Go through the window,

Straight-up madman.
Michael liked the idea
of me being around
because I was a big fucking guy.
6'5", 290 pounds.
I'd break your fucking neck
if your neck needed breaking.
The first time I saw Walter,
I said to myself, "Bad."
We liked to have coverage:
cops working and cops off duty.
We could put these things
together where we were on duty,
and if the police got called,
we'd be the responding
police team.
We put it all together,
and then, um, we hit the place.
You walk in like you own
the fucking place.
Everybody on the floor now!
Fucking do what I tell you!
Shut the fuck up!
You knock somebody down,
you know,
you put a gun
to his fucking head,
you fire a shot
over his fucking head...
that's an attention-getter.
Mikey's just crazy.
He'll do what he wants,

Michael's favorite line was,
"What the fuck are you doing

They put everyone on the floor,

And if all that works,
you walk out of there with
the bag full of fucking money

stealing money and guns,
shaking down shopkeepers.
FEMALE REPORTER: Six New
York City police officers
charged with conspiring
to sell cocaine.
MALE REPORTER: It has become an
all too familiar sight in New York:
cops arrested
on corruption-related charges.
WALTERS: And a new
breed of corrupt cop...
none was more notorious
than officer Michael Dowd.
MALE REPORTER: He was
dirty up to his eyeballs.
The story of cops and robbers...

one from the other.

HALL:
I was driving in to work,
and I heard on the radio that
New York City police officers
had been arrested
in Suffolk County.
I felt like,
"Fuck, Suffolk County got them?"
Suffolk County got them?
DOWD:
I wasn't scared.
It was almost like
a sense of relief hit me.
I was like,
"Thank God it's over.
Thank you
for saving my fucking life."
♪ ♪
Nothing was off the table
with me
at that point in my life.
It really didn't make sense
to me, what was happening.
I was so used
to winning every day.
I'd been beating these people
for five, six, seven,
eight years.
This is just another...
this is just another obstacle
I have to learn to get around,
and I will.
In my mind,
I was gonna get around this.
EURELL:
Here we are, out on bail...
it's about a month
after our arrest,
uh, mid-June sometime...
facing 25 to life
for drug trafficking charges.
It was at my insistence
that we try to develop a plan
on how to minimize the damage
at this point.
There's a Colombian living
in my house, in Brentwood.
He said,
"Leave the fucking country.
"You're doing 25 to life
in the state
"if they fucking hammer you.
"You are... you're done.
You're done."
He knows I'm in a spot.
Comes to me and says,
"Are you interested
in doing a hit
at this woman's house
on Avon Street in Queens?"
There's a drug lord whose wife
is holding on
to a large sum
of cash and cocaine
that they owe this Colombian
that's staying in my home.
So the plan is to grab
this guy's wife,
kidnap her,
grab any money and drugs
in the house,
turn her over to the Colombians
for execution.
DOWD:
"What's in it for me?"
He said, "There's several
hundred thousand in cash,
and, uh, at least ten kilos."
He has this whole plan
to flee bail
with a kidnapping
and murder scheme.
I said, "Kenny, this is my plan.
Are you in or you out?"
He pounds his hand and goes,
"We need to do this thing."
He says, "I'm in."
Well, that's all
I wanted to hear.
I mean, my life was in turmoil.
I don't give a fuck.
It's me and Kenny
back together again.
♪ ♪
Mike picks me up
the next morning.
We went off to Avon Street.
We're driving our way there.
As we approach...
"Kenny, you got the scanner?
"Let's see if the scanner works.
See what's going on
on the scanner."
We turn on the local scanner
to listen to the local precinct.
The scanner's not on a minute,
and you hear,
"Suspicious car
on Avon Street."
There's no way
you're hiding that.
Mike picked that up.
Avon Street is two blocks long.
It's got to be related to us.
DOWD: Well,
when the call came in on the scanner,
he said to me,
"We're going to the house."
I said, "Whoa.
Why would we go to the house?
The block is staked out."
"Mike, I came
all the way this far.
We're going
to the fucking house."
I said, "You go to the house.
I ain't going there."
So rather than stop
at Avon street,
I kept... I jumped back
onto the Grand Central Parkway
and headed home.
EURELL:
We get the fuck out of there.
DOWD:
As I'm driving,
I see cars just converging
from everywhere,
sort of closing in
on the location behind us.
EURELL: We get all the
way back to my house.
He decides to go home.
I said, "All right, man,
I'm gonna call you later."
DOWD: And I notice four,
five, six more different,
ten different
vehicles following me.
I'm finding cars,
undercover cops,
every-fucking-where,
and I'm not believing it.
I went home,
walked in the door,
looked at my wife.
She says, "Oh, by the way,
"Dori told me last night
that 'If I never see you again,
remember I love
both you and Mike. ""
I said, "She said that to you?
You didn't
tell me this last night?"
She goes, "Well, I didn't think
it was important."

With that, I turned around,
and I heard the police cars
swinging into my cul-de-sac...
(WHOOSHING)
The noise of... the noise of cars
pulling into my cul-de-sac.
(CARS WHOOSHING)
(CAR DOORS SLAMMING)
When they walked in my door,
I knew it was Kenny.
How the fuck could he do this?
I was already in trouble!
I was already in trouble!
♪ ♪
We decided to approach
the person who appeared to be,
from our information
and from
the Suffolk County case,
the less culpable
of the two individuals.
And so we reach out
to Kenny Eurell's lawyer.
(SIREN WAILING)
TROSTER:
Kenny's attorney brings him in.
I ask him his full name,
what's his wife's full name.
I get all the background
information.
And it sort of sets him at ease,
'cause now he's in a routine
of answering questions.
Then I throw out
the name Baron Perez.
And he looks at me...
gets a shocked look on his face.
They did not know at that time
that there's an ongoing
federal criminal investigation
that goes back years.
TRIMBOLI: They had been
taping Auto Sound City,
Baron, Michael Dowd,
drug transactions
that Michael Dowd bodyguarded
for the drug dealers.
They had informants inside...
the whole thing.
They even had me on tape.
TROSTER: Kenny's
attorney's gonna tell him,
"Your exposure just went
"from whatever the state
was gonna give you
to now you're looking at this
in the federal system,"
and he's gonna
have a "come to Jesus" moment.
♪ ♪
DOWD: There's a Colombian
living in my house.
EURELL: So the plan is
to grab this guy's wife.
I said, "Kenny, this is my plan.
Are you in or you out?"
"You've literally lost
your mind.
We're not fucking doing that."
Kenny spoke to Marty,
our lawyer.
I go to my lawyer.
I let him know what's goin' on.
He goes, "You can't allow
something like that to happen."
DORI:
"Kenny, it's RICO.
"You're looking at 25 years.
"You're goin' down.
"You have to give him up.
You have to."
That was, you know,
clear that I need to start
working with the DEA, and...
I decide to cooperate
with the feds.
Mike Troster gets me
a micro-recorder,
and at that time, 1992,
a micro-recorder was,
you know, that fuckin' big.
TROSTER:
It was big,
big enough
that if you're wearing it,
you're self-conscious,
like, "Holy crap, I got this
big piece of equipment on me."
"We're gonna wire your phone
in case Dowd calls
and talks on the phone."
Every contact, as much
as possible, with Michael
has to be on audio
or videotape or both.
I don't want to wear it
anywhere on my chest,
because we normally
hugged each other
and gave each other a kiss
when we met each other,
so I came up with,
I'll wear it behind my calf.
I got muscular calves,
and I'll Ace bandage it.
He had, like...
it was like a little smirk.
I'm like,
"I'm freaking out over here."
My wife's like, "What could you
possibly be smiling about?"
I'm like, "I feel
like a cop again."
DORI: "Really,
I'm just praying I get to see you again."
And, you know,
when I hugged him,
I hugged him like I wasn't
ever gonna see him again,
that this is probably
gonna turn horribly wrong.
HALL: Michael's plan was to
go to the house on Avon street
in Jamaica Estates, Queens,
knock on the door,
deliver a bouquet of flowers,
and then they were gonna
bring her out,
kidnap her,
take her to a motel,
and there she would be
handed over to the Colombians.
If we walked to the door
with a bouquet of flowers,
knocked on the door,
she'd probably open up
to receive the flowers.
So it was as simple as that.
I didn't think...
it was a no-brainer.
On the news...
I'm sitting there
watching the news,
'cause I'm watching
the news every day,
'cause we're almost
on the news every night.
Totally separate story...
a lady was killed and murdered
because someone posed
as a flower delivery person.
So I'm sitting there
with my wife.
I'm like, "Oh, my God,
I hope Mike's not fucking
watching the news now,"
'cause I know he's gonna want
to call me and discuss it.
(PHONE RINGS)
EURELL:
Yeah?
I'm watching it, yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I was gonna call you,
but I figured what's the point?
We did not change our plan.
Some other woman
living in Queens
is not gonna not open her door
for flowers.
The flower thing
can be used a few times.
Not every flower delivery is
a fucking armed robbery murder.
The recordings that Eurell made
were extremely helpful
to prove Dowd's
involvement in this crime.
EURELL: We're trying to figure
out exactly how we're gonna
grab the woman,
grab any money
or drugs in there,
and then bring her off
to the Colombians
for the execution.
Where Kenny comes up
with the idea that this woman
was gonna be delivered
to Colombians
and kidnapped and executed
is beyond me.
Michael's lying.
Kenny wore tapes.
The tapes reflect
that Michael planned
to abduct the woman in Queens.
It was Kenny's words,
never mine.
Go to the tapes.
Listen to the tape.
TROSTER:
Kenny paged me
in the wee hours of the morning.
He says, "It's happening.
We're doing it in the morning."
TROSTER: Agents are gonna go
to this woman in her house,
tell her, "Listen,
your life is in jeopardy.
"We're gonna put you
somewhere safe,
"and we are gonna
stay in your house.
"Michael's gonna come
to do the abduction,
and Michael's
gonna get arrested."
Didn't happen that way.
Mike picks me up
the next morning.
We went off to Avon street.
As we approach...
I go, "Kenny,
you got the scanner?"
The scanner's not on
a minute, and you hear,
"Suspicious car
on Avon Street."
One of the surveillance guys
was parked near the house,
and someone called
the police on him.
He identified himself,
said, "Hey,
we're DEA
doing a surveillance."
There's no way
you're hiding that.
Mike picked that up.
We get the fuck out of there.
As I'm driving, I see cars
just converging from everywhere.
Now my mind starts spinning.
"How am I gonna make sure
Mike doesn't relate this to me?"
The plan was, DEA's gonna
arrest us all and take us in
and make it look like
I'm part of being arrested.
They were, at that point, gonna
grab my wife and grab my kids
and bring them to a hotel
to keep them safe
until they could figure out
what to do with us after that.
(PHONE RINGS)
DORI:
Troster called me, and he said
that I need to get
out of the house.
Got fucked up.
"We don't even know
where Kenny is."
I'm like, "What do you mean
you don't know where Kenny is?"
My wife has bags packed
at the door, ready to go,
waiting for the DEA
to pick her up and save her.
I had to wire him,
and now they're coming back?
EURELL: We get all the
way back to my house.
I went to go into his house;
he told me, "Hold on.
I got to check on...
see if my wife is dressed."
Kenny never stopped me
from seeing his wife
dressed or undressed,
and now all of sudden,
he's gonna check?
I was very suspicious.
Holy shit!
I'm running.
I grab those bags.
I run as fast as I can.
My wife is thinking on the fly.
She hears the car pull up in
the driveway, the doors close.
She peeks out the window,
sees it's us getting back
and Mike is there.
I throw those bags
into the bedroom.
- Hides the bags by the door.
- Out of sight.
She starts panicking.
I run into the bathroom,
wet my hair...
Wets her hair like she's just
getting out of the shower,
'cause now it's taking her
five minutes to answer the door.
DORI: Took off my clothes
and put on a robe,
and they're banging the door.
Why Kenny wasn't
using the key...
I don't have no keys on me.
Walked in the house.
The fuckin' house was empty.
I looked around...
"Where's all your furniture?"
"Oh, you know
I'm selling the house."
"Yeah, but why would you empty
the fuckin' house out?"
"Well, it shows better
when the house is empty."
Had a good answer,
the motherfucker.
I'm freaking out.
Mike was supposed
to be behind bars
and I would not have to deal
with any of this confrontation.
Mike is pumped.
"Dor, Dor, we came
this close to being arrested.
We were this close."
"Someone ratted us out.
They knew we were there."
I'm like, "How they hell
could they know that?"
He decides to go home and says,
"All right, man,
I'm gonna call you later."
My only concern now is,
I got to get in touch
with my lawyer and the DEA
and Internal Affairs
and this other district
to let them know
what's going on.
It's out of the bag now.
He knows the DEA's got
a surveillance going on.
We got to go lock up Michael.
As we were pulling up
to his house,
there's kids playing
in the street.
I tell the kid,
"You need to go inside."
'Cause I didn't know.
I'd heard Michael would fight.
He's a cop, I...
There could be guns.
I didn't want a kid around.
And he runs straight
to Michael Dowd's house.
It's Michael's kid.
And all of a sudden, I hear...

coming into my cul-de-sac.
