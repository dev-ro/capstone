Darkness, I charge you
with this sign
mother in the night
are mine.
I teach you the mystery
of rebirth
work my mysteries
in Earth.
Hear my ears
and speak with my tongue.
Drawn to the heart
and lip
five points
to this fellowship.
I bring you ecstasy
and rebirth.
Be with my things living
on my own.
From me they come
and to me they go.
I invoke you
and call upon you
brought by seed
and Earth.
Hear me with my ears
and speak with my tongue.
- I invite you to come.
- I invite you to come.
Get in, psycho.
What?
What?
What the fu..
You're fuckin' weird,
dude.
- Mom?
- Wait a second.
Honey, I said
give me a second.
I just wanted to see
if you were okay.
Where are you going
on a school night?
I'm going to that
book signing, remember?
I told you.
Do whatever you want.
I don't care.
Okay.
You get one of those
tattooed on you.
Bad ass motherfucker.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It's an amazing book.
Thank you.
I find it
really fascinating
because the writing
is so good
and you take the
subject seriously.
Thank you.
But I just wish that
maybe you could write
a little bit more
about rituals. Um..
I think you've got enough
of them in there. No?
Just, careful
what you believe in.
Alright?
Yeah.
- What's your name?
- Leah.
Leah,
that's a lovely name.
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah, thanks.
I love this part,
about evil.
"I don't think the devil's
role is to create evil,
but rather to expose the
evil in the hearts of men
by challenging
their loyalty to God."
Fuck, that's cool.
I don't care if this guy
looks like my dad.
He's still fuckin' cool.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Do you think our parents
will always be our parents?
What the hell
does that mean?
Like, I mean, like
we're supposed to
look up to them
but they're really just
fuckin' people. right?
Like walking in on them
takin' a shit?
No. Like..
I mean, like,
they're just people
and they fuck up
and they make mistakes
and really they're just
fuckin' people.
It's weird.
Stop.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay, bye.
Fuck.
What's wrong?
You tell me.
Leah? Leah!
Leah, get downstairs.
So, are you gonna
tell me
that the book signing
just ended
and you're home right after
like a good girl, huh?
No.
I called the library
and I know what time
it ended, so..
So?
So, I'm tired of you lying
to my face.
I'm trying to do
the best I can, okay?
I'm havin' a really
hard time here
I need you on my side.
Well, you're
all over the place.
What is that supposed
to mean?
It means I don't even know
who I'm coming home
to anymore.
Leah..
...I just can't do it
here anymore, okay?
I'm trying, but I feel
like I can't breathe.
This place feels
like your father's funeral
every fucking day.
- I have to move on.
- What?
I didn't wanna
say anything in case
I changed my mind,
but I signed a lease
on a place
up north from here.
I'm selling this house.
Honey, I need
a fresh start
please understand.
We're moving?
Yes.
When?
By the end of the month.
Oh, fu..
Fuck. Fuck.
You're making pancakes?
Sure, why not?
Sit, sit.
Okay.
I'm gonna be late
for work, so enjoy.
Mwah!
Oh, I, um, I need to go
to the new place today.
I want you
to come with me.
I'll pick you up
after school. Okay?
Leah?
Yeah, okay.
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.
That's fucking bullshit,
just like that?
Yeah, I don't know
what to do about it.
She's taking me
out there tonight.
I'm sure I'm gonna
fucking hate it.
Here.
No, I shouldn't, um,
she's picking me up soon.
That's fucking bullshit.
Leah?
Coming.
So, what are you gonna do
about work?
Everything I do
from the office
I can do from home.
And maybe I'll get
a little hobby job
on the weekends.
We can do it together,
that could be fun.
I spend the weekends
with my friends.
Well, you'll make
new friends at school.
Okay. We should
talk about that.
I was thinking
I can transfer you
after the holidays.
Does that sound good?
- No.
- No?
No.
I don't wanna change
schools, Mom.
Why don't you just let me
get my license?
I can drive myself down.
When you can afford
your own car
and learn to drive,
absolutely.
Well, when are you gonna
let me do that?
It's like your way
of controlling me.
I really don't wanna fight
with you today.
Would you be happy
finishing the school year
and then transfer
next year?
I will drive you
in the morning
pick you up after school.
Take it or leave it.
You have everything?
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.
- Lunch? Okay.
- Yup.
I'll be right here
after school, okay?
Okay.
- Oh. Fuck.
- What?
My mom's waiting for me.
Well, we'll see you
this weekend, right?
We're going to that, like,
stupid carnival thing.
No, I have to be
up north with her.
Shit, that's too bad.
Okay. Cool, see you later.
See ya.
Fuck.
Hey, kiddo,
how was your day?
Great.
And you shouldn't
call me that either.
Well, that's how
you're acting.
Hey! Get down here,
right now!
What?
You know, you better start
respecting me or...
Or what, you're gonna
uproot my life?
God, you are acting
like such a brat!
Oh, how else am I supposed
to act, Mom?
You know, I am driving over
two fuckin' hours a day
so you can be
with your stupid friends
- and that is not enough for you!
- Don't call them stupid.
- Come here! Come here!
- What?
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.
- Fuckin' don't touch me.
- Give me your hand.
What is this?
A pentagram. Oh!
You wanna be a Manson
chick or something.
It's ridiculous.
Ever since
your father died
you've been
into that occult crap.
It makes me feel better!
- And my friends...
- Your friends?
Your friends are losers,
Leah,
like you're becoming.
I give up. I give up.
Oh, you give up?
Moving on is impossible
with you.
Every time I look at you,
I see your father's face.
God, I wish I could
just wipe it off.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
I wish you were dead!
Darkness, I charge you

Drawn to the heart and hip
I spin my mysteries

Darkness, I charge you

I teach you

Pyewacket.
I call upon you, brought

I invite you to come.
Pyewacket.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just gimme a second.
- Ah!
- Oh, my God, honey.
Let me see.
Honey, what happened?
We need to clean this.
I know, I know.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh.
Alright.
Okay, hold this.
You can tell me..
...if you..
No, I..
It was an accident.
Where did you go?
I just..
Leah.
Leah, I am so sorry.
I should have
never said that.
Honey, please forgive me.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God,
this is so cute.
Look.. Boo!
Ah, we... we saw this
from the street.
- It is the cutest store.
- Oh, thank you.
And I was wondering..
D... do you have
an application
because I would
really love
to work here
on the weekends.
I think it would be
so much fun.
- Alright.
- Wow.
Okay, uh, you know what..
Such a cute store.
I think it would be fun to
work there on the weekends.
You alright?
Yeah, let's go
get some lunch.
Sounds good.
Mom!
You okay?
Not a scratch.
He said we were lucky.
I can't believe
how close that was.
Did you know
that your father drove
13 hours straight
so he could lay eyes
on you
as soon as you were born?
He never told me that.
Oh, yeah.
He was away on a job.
He couldn't afford
a flight.
I told him it was okay.
I mean, I understood
if he couldn't make it.
But, you know your dad.
He rented this car anyway
and he drove
straight through.
And the best part is
he did make it.
He rushed into
the delivery room.
I mean,
I barely remember, but..
...I've never seen him
so excited.
And he thanked me
every single night
for a year after that.
For what?
You.
He said you were
the best thing
that ever happened to him.
I know I've been hard
on you.
God, I'm so sorry.
Mom. Mom. Mom.
There's someone
in the house.
Leah, I don't
hear anything.
I swear
there's someone up there.
Okay.
Nothing.
Are you... are you sure?
No. See for yourself.
Go on.
So, let's have a break,
when we come back
uh, we will
answer questions.
I'm sure you all
have many as we do
as we got into today
which is
absolutely fascinating.
Oh, fuck. Oh, God.
- Bullshit.
- Why would I make that up?
'Cause you're nuts.
I don't know.
- Rob...
- No, it happened.
It's happening. It's real.
It's fucking real.
I can't believe
you wanted to kill
your own mother.
That's the scary part.
I mean, why?
God, I would
never do that.
I regret it, okay?
And don't be such
a fucking hypocrite, Rob.
You do rituals all the time
to try and get girls
and they never
fucking work.
Yeah, but that's not
black-craft shit.
You want to kill
your own fucking mother!
I'm just sayin',
if it worked
then maybe
you deserve it.
Fuck you.
Fuck you, too.
- Leah.
- Lee.
Leah. Come on, sit down.
Fuck.
Listen, Leah,
we're here, okay?
We... we wanna help.
Why did you..
Hm. Alright.
But what do you
wanna do about it?
I don't wanna go back.
I can't go back.
- Okay.
- I'll go.
I think it's cool.
And I wanna see
some weird shit.
We can, like, get it
on camera or something.
What do you say? Can I?
Can I come up tonight
and, like, stay over?
Um, what about
your parents?
They don't give
a shit what I do.
It's a waste of time.
She's just looking
for attention.
Well, we're gonna find out
while you sit at home
and jerk off tonight.
Fuck you.
Yeah.
Hey, mom, is it cool if
Janice sleeps over tonight?
- Oh, hey, Janice.
- Hi.
Did you check
with your parents?
Yeah, they said
it was cool.
And I'd really like to
come up, if that's okay.
Sure. Of course,
let's go.
Sick.
Fuck, man.
This is brutal.
Aw. I love this.
Thank you, girls.
Thanks so much for dinner.
It was really good.
Oh, you're too kind.
Alright.
Okay, I'm off to my room
to get some work done.
You girls gonna
be alright?
- Yup.
- Oh, Janice.
There's a, a pillow
and a blanket
on the couch for you.
Okay, that's
great. Thanks.
Um, thanks again
for letting me stay.
Alright. Goodnight.
Night.
"Thank you, thank you.
Yes, thank you."
Shut up. Get
back to work.
You have lots
of dishes to do.
I'm timing you, you take
nine million years.
If you get this shit on my
leather jacket, I will kill you.
What?
I'm just happy
you're here.
Yeah, man.
Are you gonna put up posters
or something in here?
It's so... weird.
Uh, not yet.
Okay, what are we doing?
Get your phone out.
Okay.
Okay, it was..
Are you recording?
Yeah. Wait, hold. There.
It was just up here
and it was making
a ton of noise
so, let's just..
You just wanna wait?
Yeah, just give it
a minute.
Or should we,
like, summon it
like, call its name?
Totally rando, but I
would pick Billy Corgan
over, like, any guy.
Hands down, seriously.
Leah, don't worry.
I believe you.
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't.
Maybe I'm nuts
like Rob said.
Urgh! Fuck Rob.
He's just jealous
'cause he likes you
and he knows
you're into Aaron.
What? No, I'm not.
Oh, my God. You two,
it's too fucking obvious.
Uhh..
Why, did he
say something?
Wondering.
Um, I will tell you
if you smoke
this joint with me.
Like, your mom moved,
like, most of the shit
but, like, all
the fuckin' owls.
- Dude, they're everywhere.
- Yeah, I don't get it.
She put one
in your fucking room.
So she says, she's just,
like, watching me.
- It's fucked up.
- That shit creeps me out.
Not much creeps me out,
but that shit does.
I don't know what
it is about owls.
I don't know.
They can turn their heads
all the way around.
- And their eyes are huge.
- Where did you do it, by the way?
Over there in the woods.
Well, show me,
come on. Let's go.
No. It's way too dark out.
We'll use the fucking
flashlight on my phone.
It's not that far, right?
What's the point?
Because I want to see it.
That's why I came up.
Come on, please?
Where are we going?
- This way?
- Yeah.
It's just a
little further.
- Watch out.
- Huh.
You see it?
Right up ahead.
- Oh, yeah. That?
- Yeah.
It's perfect.
- This, right?
- Yeah, right here.
- Ah..
- Right here.
Yeah, you're right.
It is really creepy
out here.
Yeah.
It's really scary.
Heh.
What are you doing?
Janice, stop that.
Hey, stop that.
Good.
Janice?
Janice, what
are you doing? Stop.
Hey, where are you going?
Janice!
Janice!
Come back!
Janice?
Janice!
Janice, this isn't
funny anymore.
My God.
You're an asshole!
I'm leaving.
Wait! Leah, wait!
I'm fucking around.
You're so funny.
You are such a loser.
- What?
- I was just fucking around.
It isn't funny.
I'm stoned.
I know, I'm sorry.
Well, okay, I think
I'm just gonna go to bed.
- I'm tired.
- Okay.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
Hey, I'm, I'm sorry. I was
just, like, fucking around.
Hm. No, that's fine.
I'll... see you
in the morning.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Honey?
Honey?
Where's Janice?
It's so strange.
Janice?
Janice?
Leah?
What is it?
My car.
Hey, Janice, are you okay?
Janice, unlock the door.
Janice, what's going on?
- Please open the door.
- Hey.
- Take me home.
- What?
- Please, please.
- Janice.
- Take me home!
- Janice!
I just wanna go home!
You need
to open the door.
- Please.
- Please just unlock the door.
I'll get the keys.
Okay.
Janice?
Janice, what's wrong?
What happened?
I'll, I'll make you
something to eat.
You'll feel better.
No! I'm not, I'm not going
back inside that house!
- Hey...
- Don't touch me!
Okay, let's go.
Okay, take out your books
and pick up
where we left off.
Chapter two, part two.
From the paragraph
that starts with
"Evening was coming on
when he reached home."
Finish the chapter and
write a paragraph, uh..
Oh, okay.
No, I really don't know. It
was the strangest thing.
I'm worried about her.
Yes, please, keep me
posted. Thank you.
Janice hasn't left
her bedroom.
Any luck?
I texted her all day,
and nothing.
She really scared me.
Do you know if she's
going through something?
No, I don't think so.
I got a call
from the gift shop
and they want me
to come in tomorrow.
I really wanna do this.
Please don't get mad.
Why would I get mad?
I won't be able to pick you
up from school tomorrow
so you'll have
to take the bus.
At first I thought no,
but it'll be good for you.
- What do you think?
- Okay.
- You'll be okay alone?
- Mm-hmm.
I was really fucking
worried about you, man.
Like, are you okay? You weren't
answering any of my texts.
Yeah, I'm sorry.
Well, what about Janice?
I haven't seen her since
she went up with you.
Look, I, I really
gotta go.
I'll just
talk to you later.
Leah, if I did something,
you'd tell me, right?
Yeah, I just really need
to go right now, okay?
I'm sorry.
A dark spirit
like Pyewacket
is very manipulative.
So am I right to assume
that during the ritual
you believed in it
as much as you believe
I'm talking to you
right now?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
Then we have to assume
it's here.
You need to think
of it as a river.
Evil is simply waiting
across on the other side
and you used yourself
as a bridge
to bring them over
to your side.
And once they fulfill the
task you asked of them
they'll start hurting the
person they communicated with.
And that's you, Leah.
With black magic,
it's thrown back.
It starts with you
and it will end in you.
To undo this,
you need to perform
the exact,
the exact same ritual
in the same place,
but in reverse.
At every step,
you ask for forgiveness.
Leah, this is
very important.
You have to do this before
it gets to your mother
or it's too late.
Pyewacket
can take many forms
so don't trust
your lying eyes.
Leah?
Leah?
Leah!
Hello?
Hello?
Leah!
Fuck.
911. What is
your emergency?
My mom just died.
What is your name?
- I'm... I'm Leah Reyes.
- Okay.
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.
Can you just tell me
where you are
and exactly what happened
to your mother?
I don't know, I don't, I
don't even know where I am.
I don't know where I am and
I don't know what to do.
- Please help me.
- Okay.
- Stay calm.
- Leah!
Who's that
calling out, Leah?
Can you put them
on the phone?
- I don't know.
- Leah!
Can you put her
on the phone?
Leah? Are you
still with me?
Leah, it's nice
to hear from you.
- Aaron, please help.
- What happened?
Aaron, I can't be here anymore.
Please, come get me.
Okay, I can't get the car until
later when my parents leave.
No, please, I... I
need you right now.
I don't know if
I could drive that far.
Aaron, just please come.
Leah.
Come inside.
Close the door.
Where were you?
Where'd you go?
Out for a walk.
With that?
What were you
gonna do with it?
I should put it away.
Leah?
Just let me in.
Just open the door.
Leah!
Come outta your room!
Right now!
No.
Oh. Damn!
Please. Please. Please.
Please.
Please. Please.
Please. Please. Please.
Oh, plea..
Please.
Oh, my God,
please, please.
- Get away from me!
- Honey.
- Get away!
- Honey?
Let go of the knife.
Get away from me! No!
No, I know who
you really are.
I know who you
really are!
Just get,
get away from me!
Please, just
give me the knife.
No. No. No. No. No.
Don't, don't touch me!
- It's okay.
- No.
- Honey.
- No.
Don't. Don't.
Leah, what were you doing
in the woods earlier?
I was calling for you.
And why do you
have a knife?
What were you
gonna do with it?
I'm gonna hang on
to it tonight.
Hm..
Honey, what is it?
Honey?
What's that smell?
Leah? What are you doing?
Leah?
Leah!
Oh, God! Oh!
Leah!
Leah?
Leah, wake up.
Come on, wake up!
Leah! Leah,
come on, wake up!
Wake up!
Can you just tell me
where you are
and exactly what happened
to your mother?
I don't know. I don't, I
don't even know where I am.
I don't know where I am and
I don't know what to do.
- Please help me.
- Okay.
- Stay calm.
- Leah!
Who's that
calling out, Leah?
Can you put them
on the phone?
- I don't know.
- Leah!
Can you put her
on the phone?
Leah? Are you
still with me?
We didn't find your mother's
body in the woods, Leah.
The only one we found
was in your house
burned to ash.
Was that your mother?
Let's try this again.
How did the fire start?
