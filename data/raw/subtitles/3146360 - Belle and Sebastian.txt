BELLE AND SEBASTIAN
You see that track?
That's no wolf.
It's the beast.
It went along the ridge.
We'll follow it.
3 sheep in 1 week is too much!
Bastards!
Shooting a female,
and in high summer!
We can't let the baby die there.
I'll lower you down, OK?
Let me know
when you're on the ledge,
and I'll give you some slack.
Are you OK?
When it's in your pack,
tug and I'll pull you up.
OK.
We look for a lion
and find a lamb.
We'll see if she accepts it.
Come on.
Let her smell it.
Go ahead.
Gently.
Very gently.
That's good.
OK, try to get it to suckle,
nice and gentle.
Get it to suckle.
That's good.
Very good.
Not too bad, huh?
But let's not believe it quite yet.
These things can take time.
Let's leave them.
I'll go bring in the cows.
With that beast around
I want to be careful.
I'll see you at home tonight.
You go help Angelina.
Go via Glantiéres, OK?
Straight home.
No detours, got it?
Go on!
Morning, César.
That needs disinfecting.
That beast came right at me.
If I'd had my gun...
You'd miss an elephant at five feet.
Who shot that chamois?
None of your business, César.
You didn't see it was a female
with her young? Are you blind?
This isn't the right time.
We need your help.
We've got to get rid
of that beast.
I saw its tracks
on the Andagne ridge.
It went further down.
André was in Glantiéres.
Glantiéres?
I won't take your rabbit.
César calls you "the beast".
César's my grandpa.
Not my real grandpa,
but it's the same.
Look,
your little savage is alive.
What's that face?
Did you see the beast?
It's prowling nearby.
Look at André's leg.
When will you teach him to talk?
When you learn to shut up.
Come on, guys.
What were you up to?
Nothing.
Nothing?
OK...
Go with them.
It's safer.
Go on.
César wasn't too drunk for once.
Check again in 3 hours.
You drink just as much.
And he doesn't kill
chamois mommies.
Who do you think you are, brat?
I know why it bit you.
Your stink made it think
you're a goat.
Watch your mouth!
Leave him alone.
The kid's not wrong.
You really do stink like a goat.
Keep walking!
Saint Martin, July 1943
Tevré, hide the weapons.
I'll go warn Angelina.
Let's hurry, boys.
Go warn Guillaume.
He's coming down the Ecrins path.
You know the way.
Go!
They'll arrest him?
No, you just need to warn him.
Go on, fast!
All good?
Good morning.
Starting this week,
every Monday,
you must supply
30 kilos of bread.
Orders from headquarters.
30 kilos for our small bakery?
I advise you not to put
bran in the flour
like the unfortunate baker
in Maurienne.
Are you supplying the flour?
Orders are orders.
Remember we are at war.
Real soldiers fight.
They don't pillage bakeries.
See you on Monday.
The Grand Défilé pass is dangerous?
We weren't there.
We were at Glantieres.
There's a beast killing our sheep.
- With no guns...
- Liar!
Actually, you do what I do,
Mr. Mayor.
You hunt vermin.
There are too many
in your mountains.
Way too many.
They go over the passes
under cover of night.
Like rats.
You mean the beast?
Please don't take me for...
How is it you say?
An ass?
Is that it?
I need the names of the people
who pass the fugitives.
The Krauts are here.
In the village.
Don't touch it.
Come on.
Does it have real bullets?
Hush, Sebastian.
Come on.
Harassing old ladies now?
We found tracks
at the Grand Défilé pass.
There was another crossing
last night.
A crossing?
Of what?
I'll get them in the end.
You'd better not happen
to be in the area,
picking blueberries,
or observing marmots.
Is that clear?
Perfectly clear.
At that age,
the baby couldn't do anything.
It could never have survived
without its mother.
Right, César?
No thanks.
I prefer keeping a clear head.
It's what clears mine.
You should try it.
It's OK now, Sebastian.
The kid has a new mother,
and it has you, too.
But it must be hard on it anyway,
not having its real mother.
Cesar'?
Will my mom come
for Christmas this year?
You said she'd come.
How long does it take
to get here from America?
I don't know.
I've never been to America.
How come, César?
Why haven't you been
to America?
It's right beyond the mountains.
Your soup's getting cold, Angelina.
Angelina?
Do you lick Guillaume's ears?
Why are you asking that?
André's son says lovers
lick each other's ears.
He should fall in love,
then he can talk about it.
Good night, Sebastian.
Has anyone seen it kill sheep?
- Who?
- The beast.
Didn't César show you
the dead sheep?
Yes, but he never saw it attack.
If he had,
he wouldn't have missed it.
Time to sleep now.
I'll put out 3 more.
If the beast comes near the sheep...
Clack!
Maybe it's not killing the sheep.
Of course it is.
A shepherd in Verpeille
got a dog for the wolves.
They have a lot.
Unfortunately, he didn't like dogs.
What did he do?
Who knows.
Some say he beat it.
So it ran away,
and it turned feral.
I'm sure.
I'm sure it's that dog.
Who told you?
André.
He knows the shepherd.
I'm looking for André.
André?
He's working up there in the forest.
What are you doing here?
Don't I stink like a goat?
Don't stand there.
You'll get hurt.
But I want to help you.
You want to help?
Get that stick back there.
Hurry UP!
Is it true
you know the man
who beat the beast?
Yes.
Why did he beat it?
What's it to you?
Why'd he do it?
Because it was mean?
Or disobedient?
People aren't born mean.
The same goes for dogs.
So Why?
Why, Why...
Do you know why people make war?
There you go!
There is no why.
He kept the dog on a short chain.
He beat it.
Sometimes he wouldn't
feed it for days.
So the dog went completely nuts.
No.
You can't help those animals.
I know you're there.
Why are you hiding?
Come out, please!
It's important.
César put out traps
all around the sheepfold.
You can't go there.
You're no fun, you know that?
No! Come back!
Be careful.
How can you be so clumsy!
Please forgive us.
Thank you.
I've got to show you something.
Will you come?
Come on, it's OK!
Come!
Follow me.
Good dog.
Keep following, OK?
You'll see,
it's nice up there.
Exactly.
Don't come here.
It's dangerous.
César put them all around.
Got it?
Good.
Sniff.
You have to remember that smell.
It's important.
Are you crazy?
It's a trap.
You can't scare it.
Come on, let's go.
César could turn up.
I knew it.
It's not you killing the sheep.
It couldn't be.
You know what they're doing?
They steal from all the farms.
They even took Andre's mother's jam.
Let's go home.
Not that way!
Come back.
Come back!
Isn't it pretty?
OK. Come on.
Come!
See those mountains?
Up there, with the snow.
Well right behind them,
it's America.
That's where my mom went.
Angelina,
she won't talk about it.
It makes her mad.
Oh, right,
I didn't tell you.
Angelina is...
the daughter
of the sister of César.
She died.
Not Angelina!
Angelina's mom.
She coughed a lot
and then she died.
My mom,
she might come back for Christmas.
She might bring presents.
What I'd like is a watch
with a compass in it.
How did you know it was him,
so far away?
People are allowed to go hiking.
Aren't you always up there?
But I'm big.
The lady was carrying a baby.
You don't take babies up there.
If you'd seen all their luggage...
It's grown-up business.
Guillaume does what he wants. OK?
Is it that bad?
Of course not!
It is.
You're angry.
Sebastian?
Did I ask about the sausages?
It's better not to.
The same goes for Guillaume.
It's better not to know.
Thank you.
It's about next week's crossing.
There's one planned?
Wednesday, I think.
What are you two up to?
I told her you were busy.
But it seemed so urgent.
I'll leave you.
I want to help you Wednesday.
Was it Célestine who blabbed?
Yes. It seems everyone knows but me.
I'm just protecting you.
Why do you always exclude me?
The less you know, the better.
Right!
I forgot.
Secrecy.
Discretion.
Sebastian saw you
heading to the Grand Défilé.
Why was he up there?
I forbid him to go,
but he does as he pleases.
Don't worry.
He'll keep quiet.
Angelina, he's a child.
Sebastian can't keep wandering
in the mountains all day.
It's too dangerous with the beast.
And the Krauts.
It's almost weaned.
These are its last bottles.
It'll go back to its kind
this winter.
The call of the wild.
And the other lost lamb
that needs its herd?
What herd?
school
No one knows where he goes.
What is he up to?
Come on!
Just keep him away
from the Grand Défilé.
You stink!
Come on!
Come on in!
Good.
You're so handsome!
Uh, maybe not.
You're not handsome.
You're beautiful!
Can that be your name?
Belle,
you're so beautiful
Just seeing you
I loved you
Remember when
you would come
Every evening
to meet me
So beautifully you moved
it made me dream
You know, my friend,
I loved you
Belle,
I love you so
I'll wait for you,
dreaming of you
Belle,
if you wish
We will be two
We will be two
I'm the only one who's allowed here.
It's my secret.
Come in.
It's mine.
Well...
It's ours now.
Hold on.
I'll show you the best part.
Secret passage.
Follow me.
It goes outside. You'll see.
So if you want to hide here,
you can.
No one will know.
Come on.
Come.
Are you afraid?
You're chicken.
Come on.
What are you doing here?
Cat got your tongue?
Why are you standing there?
Wait.
Let me explain.
Get out of the way.
Explain what?
Nothing!
What are you hiding?
You're really bizarre.
Come on.
Come!
You're coming to work
at the sheepfold every day.
Come on.
Don't shoot the deer!
You have no right!
If César sees you,
he'll destroy you!
Get lost, kid!
Just try it!
- Let go!
- You brat!
Get out of the way!
A broken weapon,
an immobilized soldier.
How will you settle that, Mr. Mayor?
But that beast isn't mine.
I've told you, it's dangerous.
Come here.
What were you doing there?
You want that beast to eat you?
Answer the Lieutenant, Sebastian.
I was fishing.
Fishing?
Without a rod?
I don't need a rod.
Children in your town
don't go to school?
They do.
- But he...
- This is France.
Land of liberty...
and truants.
No wonder we won the war.
You lost the last one.
César!
Lieutenant,
we can organize a hunt.
We'll kill that beast.
I know your hunts.
Full of holes.
What else can we do?
I want men.
50 at least.
50 peopm!
Tomorrow, 8 a.m.
German time.
Where will you hunt tomorrow?
Do you know that beast?
Why did it bite the Kraut?
I don't know.
Listen to me.
I've known abused dogs.
I've known guys
who've tried to save them.
It never works.
That dog is done for.
I know.
OK.
We'll do the hunt at Glantiéres.
Where you've been forbidden to go.
The only place safe for you
is Meije.
A hunt is dangerous.
I'll go to Meije. Promise!
OK.
We shoot nothing else.
Not even boar if we flush any.
The beast and only the beast.
Got it?
We walk in line
and we make noise.
Those with rattles or horns,
you shake and blow!
Which valley?
Glantiéres, of course.
It won't be in Glantiéres.
We need to search Meije.
They won't come here.
César told me so.
They're such dummies.
Let's go see if there are trout
in the stream.
Keep moving,
we're running late!
You're dragging on the left.
Keep up!
Keep moving, men!
You're not in line!
I don't get it!
Why are they here?
César said they'd go
to Glantiéres.
I swear!
Come on, quick!
Hurry!
Please!
Come!
Why are you stopping?
Don't stop!
Go!
Run away!
Don't shoot!
She's my friend!
Get out of the way!
Let me go!
Let go!
You can't kill her,
she's my friend!
Keep moving!
César,
did you see anything?
There, over there!
' Got it!
We won't find it tonight.
It won't survive the night.
OK.
Let's pack it in.
I'll call the Krauts
tomorrow morning.
What happened?
He came in after dark,
without a word.
So he's here?
Will you explain?
Well...
Imagine that dog.
Imagine...
They're all buddy-buddy,
it and the kid.
They were, anyway.
I had to lock him up.
Who?
The kid!
Because the beast, we...bam!
You should be ashamed.
Look at yourself.
You don't make sense.
And you think he's better off
with you than at school!
I'll never forgive you!
My beautiful!
You're alive!
Belle.
Where were you?
I brought all this to heal you.
You'll see, it'll be OK.
César says that brandy
cures everything.
He uses it on the sheep.
No, Belle. No!
Yes, I know.
It does sting a little.
You're burning up.
Good morning, Doctor.
Good morning, Anna.
Guillaume!
I was looking for you.
Tell me.
If a patient has a fever,
how do you make it go away?
Well, you go to school,
you study hard,
and you become a doctor.
Tell me for real.
It depends, Sebastian.
Sometimes fever is good.
It's the body
fighting off disease.
And if it's not a good fever?
It can be an infection,
of a wound,
for example.
So?
What do you do,
for example,
if there's an infestation?
Well,
if it's an infection,
you give a shot...
Why are you asking?
I don't know.
Just asking.
And then?
You disinfect the wound,
stitch it up if it's deep.
César heals his sheep
with brandy.
César does everything
with brandy.
I don't know how to shear sheep,
but I know what you need
for infections. A shot.
Or else?
Or else it can get bad.
Or else you can die.
I need a shot.
Who's sick, Sebastian ?
I can't tell you.
You'll kill her.
Don't be ridiculous.
I won't kill anyone.
We don't kill sick people,
we heal them.
It's not a people.
It's Belle.
You mean that beast they killed?
It's a wild animal, Sebastian.
It's very dangerous.
It could do anything,
especially if it's injured.
I forbid you to go near it.
She's my friend.
I'll tell César it's still alive.
Where is it?
If you do, I'll tell everyone you
take people through the mountains.
You can make her better? Right?
Don't be afraid.
This is Dr. Guillaume.
Come on Belle, don't worry.
Lie down.
She can't stand being touched.
Humans have only ever hurt her.
Then this'll be easy.
Take off the dressing
so I can see the wound.
She's not going to die?
The wound isn't too bad.
The bullet didn't hit
anything vital.
But the infestation
worries me a little.
He'll make you better.
It'll be OK.
She'll never let you
give her a shot.
I'm not going to.
I could never do it.
It's up to you now.
Where do I do it?
Feel around above
the wound.
There's a muscle.
Can you feel it?
You've got to jab it in.
Without hesitating.
Get in.
I'll take you.
No, thank you.
It's getting cold.
We're used to it.
Yes, you're very resistant here.
- Get in.
- And if I don't?
SS headquarters
has just given me carte blanche
to dismantle
the fugitive-passing network.
You know what
"carte blanche" means?
Pardon me.
I couldn't leave you out in the cold
with the snow falling,
when there's a nice warm place
next to me, could I?
You never talk?
Never to a German.
Stop!
Stop it!
Go on, precious.
Go!
You think I didn't see you, rascal?
We haven't finished.
Hand me the ribboned one.
Thanks.
My mom...
How will she know what I want?
Well...
Ask Cesar.
He can explain.
Explain what?
Nothing.
You wanted to ask me something?
No.
Fine.
Angelina?
My mom...
How will she know I want a watch
with a compass?
The watch isn't what matters most.
What matters most is...
that she's thinking of you.
Wherever she might be.
Keep going, Esther.
We've made it!
They told me 300 for the passage.
They told you wrong.
Keep it,
you'll be needing it.
Thank you.
Really, thank you.
Thank me in Switzerland.
- When do we leave?
- When the path is safe.
What is it?
Stay here.
I'll handle it.
Don't worry, darling.
I'm here.
Belle!
Belle! Come!
Belle!
Guillaume! You're injured?
Nothing serious.
Belle chased the wolves away.
They were the ones
attacking your sheep.
You call her Belle?
It's nicer
than "dirty beast", huh?
Celestine,
get me a splint.
I can't walk like this.
Or with a splint, either.
I'll go right away, Doctor.
OK, I'm sorry.
Happy now?
Pardon me?
Nothing...
I was talking to the dog.
Now he talks to dogs!
This is pointless.
I have no choice.
I can take them.
I know the path, too.
Out of the question.
I'm perfectly capable,
and you know it.
If anything happened,
I'd never forgive myself.
You really don't get it.
It's too dangerous.
- You don't trust me.
- I do!
- Really?
- You know I do.
So who tells you
about the patrols?
What are you doing?
I forbid you.
You forbid me?
Forbid me?
Stop it right now.
You don't decide
what I do with my life.
Don't be afraid.
Everything's fine.
My name is Angelina.
I've brought food.
Hello.
Where's our guide?
I'm your guide.
We'll leave at dawn.
Guillaume told me
there's no patrol tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
I'm staying with you.
You're too small.
It's too dangerous.
You say I'm too small,
but the truth is
that you don't trust me.
OK.
But only for the day.
You spend Christmas Eve with César.
And don't go far from the cave.
OK.
Look.
Angelina knows the mountains
like the back of her hand.
In two more days,
you'll be on the other side
of the mountains, in America.
That's not America,
it's Switzerland.
It is not!
The other side is America.
César told me so.
No! America's on the other side
of the ocean.
Far away. You take a boat,
and it takes a long time.
Do you know how to spell "America"?
Say what you like,
but the French make good wine...
Merry Christmas!
Lieutenant?
What is it?
If you were passing Jews,
when would you do it?
I'd do it on Christmas Day.
He's right.
It's a clear night,
so it should be a nice day.
That's not a bad idea.
Good.
Let's hurry.
Come on!
Report to me by radio,
every hour.
Good luck.
Louis!
Cesar'?
What is it?
Merry Christmas.
Where's my mom?
Your mother was a beautiful Gypsy.
I don't know why she was up high,
in the snow,
but she was in labor, so...
I took her to the Pierre Séche hut.
She made me promise
to look after you.
And she closed her eyes.
I buried her near the hut.
I promise, that's all I know.
But the moment
she put you in my arms,
I loved you like my own son.
Why did you say
she was thinking of me?
Your mother may be up there,
but her love
will carry you forever.
And I'm right here.
Angelina!
Wait!
Keep moving!
Fast!
Come back!
Faster!
Wait!
Angelina!
He's catching up!
We're not walking fast enough!
Wait!
Keep moving! Faster!
Come! Quickly!
Crouch down!
Mommy...
My baby.
It's over...
ls everything OK?
César!
Don't move.
Save your strength.
Don't go...
Don't go to the Grand Défilé.
My men are up there.
I came as fast as I could
to warn you.
You're the one?
It's always been you?
Why didn't you tell me?
Angelina,
we can't stay here.
The Grand Défilé is being watched.
And now the Eccot
will be blocked.
That leaves the Baou.
The glacier is full of
snow-covered crevasses.
Belle will be able to spot them.
Save those people.
The bastards are on the move.
Attention! Attention!
Do you copy?
Attention! Attention!
A group of fugitives,
heading for the Baou.
A group of fugitives!
A group of fugitives!
Halt!
There!
Tracks on the glacier!
They're less than 4 hours
ahead of us.
We've got the rats in our trap.
Forward!
What's wrong?
Get your things.
Fast.
We have to go right away.
We can't see a thing.
You and I have to be in front.
I can't do it alone.
I know you don't like it, Belle,
but you have to do it.
Be careful.
I saw it. Stay back.
There's no time to find another way.
We have to cross.
Are you OK, sweetheart?
You next, sweetheart.
Go on.
Come!
Don't be afraid.
That's it.
OK. Your turn!
Gently.
Good, gently.
No! Don't look down!
Come, Belle.
Sebastian, it's your turn!
She'll follow you.
Look at me!
Come on!
Nice and gentle.
Very good.
Slowly!
Come on now!
Belle, don't be afraid!
Come on, Belle!
Don't go back!
I need you!
Good, Belle. Come!
Come on, pull!
Harder!
Keep pulling!
OK, let's go.
Be brave.
Is that how you imagined America?
It's not America,
it's Switzerland.
So now you know?
Thank you.
We made it.
Where's Guillaume?
I replaced him.
And you came through the Baou?
All alone in the storm?
Thanks to Belle.
Belle, you're the bravest dog
I've ever met.
And you're really brave, too.
I'm not going back with you,
Sebastian.
I'm going to England,
to London.
I want to help win this war.
To do something that matters.
I'll be back soon, I promise.
As soon as the war's over.
Will you be OK?
Give this to Guillaume.
OK?
You can get to
the Grand Defile from here?
After that, it's easy.
Come on, Belle.
We're going home.
The boy's going back alone?
He's not alone.
