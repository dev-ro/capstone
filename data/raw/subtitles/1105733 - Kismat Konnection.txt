so what you guys were
talking about?
You know that, same Batra and Gill
and community centre problem,
Karan is saying that we can't stop
them to make a mall here,
correct!
You know Priya actually Karan
has a point,
Batra and Gill actually own
this place so...

No,,
legally they own the place,
unbelieveable!
Raj you too!
We also have human rights,
we'll fight, and you all will see,
Correct!
She's right,
I think she's got a point,
Oh common Raj,
they don't see all this,
they see profit and loss!
You know Priya Correct!
He's also got a point,
this is a problem,
I just got a fantastic idea
Hiten,
you just keep shut,
just listen ok!
What if we do something, that community centre
won't break, and mall can be build too,
we can do something like that
community centre and mall
both together,
yeah exactly,
Brilliant! That can be done great,
If you do like this, they will lose place
profit margin can get low,
why would they do something like that
he's absolutely right

Don't talk ok!
Just listen!
Don't talk! Ok!

getting good vibes,

You guys have fun.
See you. Bye
Thank God. For a minute I thought
you were going to leave.
It's you who's going to leave us, Priya.
It's all thanks to you Raj.
Hadn't you taken the responsibility
of the community center,
I would have never been able
to go with Karan.
But...
It would have been good if you
had stayed till the project completed.
With me.
I know
But this job is too important
for Karan.
And you know what?
I'm going to miss you Raj.
I'll miss you too.
By the way, this color suits
very well on you.
Really?
- Really.
Thanks.
Do you know? Karan didn't
even notice this.
I wish he was like you.
Like me?
Like what?
Like you meaning "Like you".
That's it.
If I were Karan, then?
One minute, one minute.
Attention everybody.
We haven't asked the bridegroom
the main thing.
Ask.
Priya is very dear to us.
How can we give her to you?
You'll keep her happier then
we do. How can we believe that?
Tell me now.
There's a an answer.
That too in poetry.
I'll fill her with the pearls
and diamonds of happiness.
I'll shower her with all the
peace and joy of the world.
Applause.
So Madam, are you agreed?
What's so new about this?
Everybody says all this.
If I don't fall for all this and don't
go with you? What would you do then?
Priya, come on.
What kind of question is this?
If a girl doesn't want to go with
they guy at all, what can he do?
Karan, you will have to answer
Priya's question.
There can't be any answer to
this, Aunty. Priya, come on.
Raj, you tell me.
What would you answer?
Do you have any answer?
I do have.
Really?
Then you tell me. What would you
have answered if you were Karan.
I don't get it.
How many times I told you
to talk to Priya about the work?
Once, twice, thrice...
Why didn't you talk to her?
I don't know what happened
to me.
When I saw Priya there...
I couldn't talk to her.
Our today's meeting is
too important.
And Priya is not with us
this very day.
We have to give presentation
to Gill.
You'll see now what's going
to happen.
You listen to me.
Maybe our partnership with Priya
was meant to end now.
That's it. Now it's our luck from
now on. That's all.
I know. But...
- Can you just shut up?
What? What is it?
Sometimes a car doesn't start.
Am I like the first person
in the world who's car doesn't start?
Did I say anything?
Did I?
- Then why are you staring it me?
Let's get a taxi.
Come
So what?
Sometime a taxi doesn't stop.
Did I say?
- You just shut up.
See, it stopped. Didn't it?
- Did I say anything?
Shall we go now?
What are you doing?
It's not my fault.
I'm very happy with this
new proposal of yours.
Especially with your new
technology.
Do you know uncle?
It wasn't possible till yesterday.
But suddenly a phone call came today
to Germany.
And the deal of this technology
got finalized.
With Mr. Dev's technology, our project
got a profit 8% for our company.
Mr. Dev, I'll meet you
in the office this evening.
Car didn't start.
Did I say anything?
Lift didn't work.
Did I say anything?
We didn't get a taxi.
Did I say anything?
But now, I will say.
Today, he got a telephone from
where? From Germany.
And what happened?
8 percent.
8% deduction.
It means, if you take your proposal
to Mr. Gill, it will be rejected.
I know that.
We must do something.
- What do we do?
We need to make a
new proposal.
But we need more time
for that.
We don't have that.
So what?
I can't think of anything.
You do something.
What can I do?
- I don't know, do something.
I'm going to bathroom.
Where were you?
They've been calling.
What do we do?
Let's go inside.
Inside?
Our plan will be rejected.
Then we won't show
the plan.
Plan? Then what we'll do?
When will we show?
We'll show it next week.
Lord!
Mr. Batra, trust me.
Everything will be done.
I'll take care of everything.
Give me.
Show me your design.
Show me what you've brought.
But Dev has brought us
8% savings in our budget.
But first see our designs sir.
Remember what you said?
I can't forget that shot.
Tell me sir, which design
you want to see?
B is Hiten's favorite too.
"B" is very good.
Look at it.
Sir, I want to say
something about this mall.
The mall you're building.
It will be one of it's kind
in the whole city.
But I'm making only one.
What I mean to say is...
When you'll pass in your luxury car
in front of this beautiful
mall of yours
and you'll have a decent smile
on your face
then you'll say this to your driver.
"I have built this mall, Chandu".
Chandu?
His name is Charlie.
Charlie, Chandu, it's all the same.
But you'll be proud of this mall.
Why are you looking here
and there repeatedly?
Sir, don't you feel a strange
smell?
I think it's the smell
of burning something.
Burning?
I can tell you sir,
there's something burning.
I told you, it's fire.
It's fire.
Hiten, dude, it's fire.
But sir, what about our designs.
Our meeting.
Take next week's appointment.
One minute, one last request.
This fire alarm, we will put
this same alarm at our mall.
First show me your designs. Ok?
Come on Raj, what are you doing?
Haseenaji
What is it?
What are you doing here?
I'm fixing time.
Isn't is amazing.
One time is different
to every human being.
It's good for someone
whereas bad for someone.
Please listen to me.
Because my time is being
very bad.
I have loans to pay,
loosing my work.
And now Priya is getting
married and leaving.
What exactly is your problem?
Your work? Priya's marriage?
Or both?
I don't know all this.
All I know is that...
Priya is getting married.
My heart says I should
tell her everything truly.
What?
- Shouldn't I?
What will you tell her?
What will you?
That you lied to her.
You cheated her.
It will break her heart.
So both will get separated.
And if you don't
she'll get married and leave.
And your fate will go dark.
Exactly
It will be me who'll
get screwed both ways.
Haseenaji, please you tell
me what I should do.
One minute.
I'm seeing something.
What are you seeing?
It's me who can see.
There's a solution.
It's near the girl.
Who's near the girl?
There must be someone.
Who's that?
Karan!
Who's this Karan?
Karan is her fiance, whom
she's going to marry.
Oh yes.
It's him.
So go and catch him.
Manipulate him.
You'll find your way.
You have gone mad.
Why would Karan
postpone his marriage?
Do you remember we were
going offer Priya for project work?
We'll offer the same money
to Karan. You know him.
He's a practical kind of guy
he'll agree for the money.
If Haseenaji said this,
there must be some logic.
The works on Sundays too.
Look whole office is empty.
Wait.
- What?
His cabin is here.
I don't know, Priya said
he works late on Sundays too.
Whatever.
Lets meet him.
He's not here.
Bastard is going to get married
in 5 days with Priya and he's...
I will...
No, Raj.
We have business with him.
Come, we'll come later.
One second.
- What?
Our work will be done.
- How?
You saw.
- We'll go inside.
It seems we're here at wrong time.
I'll come back after
calling you.
Maya suddenly had hurt her feet.
And you were massaging her.
It happens.
Just 2 minutes?
Take 20 dude.
He was massaging or
cuddling her?
Yes dude. If Priya finds out...
- Exactly.
Did you get my plan now?
Now lets go.
We have to do everything
for the business.
You're right.
But I was thinking...
If someone, anyone
goes and tell Priya.
What will happen?
Why anyone else.
You tell her.
Or you tell her.
It makes no difference to me.
I'll tell her, you're lying.
And Priya will take that.
- Absolutely.
See Hiten? I told you.
Karan's a bastard.
Bastard.
- Bastard, it is.
Do one thing.
Get us a drink.
Come on, I'll get you two drinks.
If you get us 2 drinks,
we'll even forget that we came here.
Isn't it Hiten?
- Absolutely.
Tell me one thing.
The girl with you today...
Wasn't she a bit older.
I mean in age.
But she must be experienced
as well.
What I could do?
It's her husband who's making
me a partner in his Australian Firm.
That's why I call him,
Bastard.
Obviously Priya won't understand so...
Why don't you do one thing?
Leave Priya
I can't find a simple and nice
girl like Priya.
Bastard!
- Bastard!
She's staring right here.
Karan, you handle her.
But I don't know about
these things.
Give me too.
- What?
Tips
This girl is too fast.
She's asking me to
take her somewhere.
Really?
- Yes.
But I don't know any place.
I can't do all this.
When will my experience help?
We'll take her to Star Resort.
I'm meeting Maya at the same
place tonight. You come too.
Raj why are you worried?
Very less people come here.
Rita, I'm really sorry that
you have do all this for me.
It's Ok.
What are friends for?
And this guy?
What kind of a man he is?
And you're saying he's going
to get married in 5 days.
That's why I want Priya to
find all the truth about this.
Men don't realize what a woman
goes through when all this happens.
If it was with me, I would
have never accepted this.
Lets go from here.
Your plans and all?
We'll find some other way.
Lets just...
You and Rita suppose to meet us
there. What are you doing here?
Actually I and Rita didn't like this place
so we thought we go somewhere else.
What happened to you so
suddenly?
Hiten, I told you we'll
go somewhere else.
Let's go somewhere else.
This is place isn't too good.
Raj, it's such a pretty place.
What are you looking there?
Let's go.
Whatever happened, isn't right.
God know, what Priya
is going through.
No john.
It's good that
our daughter is saved.
Thank God.
Where's Priya?
- Why?
What do you want now?
I want to meet her
once before I leave.
It's useless to talk to you people.
Take this. Priya has
returned your ring.
I guess, whatever happens,
happens for the good.
Maybe we were trying
to carry on a relationship
that was broken a long ago.
Raj!
What happened?
Why have you called me
at Gill's office?
Not just you, I've
called Priya as well.
See this.
- What's this?
Look at it. Kabir, Mr. Gill's assistant
has rejected our proposal.
Why?
He says that we don't
have a five years experience.
See it's written here.
Yes dude.
You're right.
- I know.
What should we do?
- I don't know.
Harry what do you think
who you are?
Come, lets go.
I get into trouble because
of your nature.
You make the program
and then cancel it.
I loose face everywhere.
Darling, just listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
Ever since that Batra has retired,
it's only you and your work.
If I don't work...
What you two are doing
here at this time?
Actually, we wanted to
talk something important with you.
I don't want to talk any
important thing with you.
Ok sir.
You will have to talk to them.
Your work is everything for you.
Then do it.
Do your work.
Darling, you're being angry
with me for nothing.
Darling, you're being angry
with me for nothing.
Darling, you're being angry
with me for nothing.
You're not doing a favor.
Why don't you guys leave?
What's your problem?
We're leaving sir.
Stay.
I know what the problem is.
He's the problem.
Speak.
Speak son.
Sir, Mr. Kabir was saying that...
our company doesn't have
five years experience so...
He was right.
Next?
Actually, he was saying we
don't have experience.
But I swear, we have the talent.
We have too much talent.
What will I do with the talent?
You have the talent.
What the company has to
do with the talent?
Where will we keep the talent?
Rule is a rule.
But sir, you selected
us by yourself.
That I forgotten.
I forgotten.
Spare me.
Right.
It's his habit to forget.
He forgot wedding anniversary.
He forgot my sweety's birthday.
And more, he even forgot
to let me sit in the car.
The car was ahead and I...
Who's this girl?
Harry, her face resembles
with our daughter Pooja's. Isn't it?
Yes, exactly.
Come here child.
Come on child.
What's your name?
Priya
I have a daughter, who
studies in London.
She looks just like you.
Darling, I'll take you to
London next week.
Tell me what is the problem?
Aunty if you will request for us
then our company will...
Then what? We can not go against
the rules of board of directors.
Iook at her she is a cute girl.
Try to understand.
Did you forgot your past? When you
was strugling and my dade has helped you.
And you was not able to get food.
Okay its enough...
okay I will try...
And I will put your
name in that list.
Hands up! Don't move.
This is a kidnape.
What joke is this? - I am not
joking I am a dangerous man.
But why are you kidnaping me?
Because you need someone.
But how you know this?
I am feeling lonely like
this from last 25 years.
And an alone face can identify
another alone face from so far.
Lets go some far with me.
Its the last way...
This is the kidnape.
And I am not joking.
I am a very dangerous girl...
Patwardhan is not in ride.
Just you and me...
Priya the electricity
is clear now.
Priya what is this at back side?
Lts an old foundation...
Its a big story...
just one minute.
There's was a theater
have to build.
And it was a mess
between those partners.
And then they built
a comunity center here.
It means no body knows
about this place? - No.
It will be a big advantage for
us if we get this foundation.
Our material and labour
cost will decrease then 20%
And not only this... We can build
it more higher then before
because this structure
can bear more load
Did you see we didn't
knows about this
even that structure is present
there from last 20 years.
And which peoples has given us this
plane they even they don't knows about it.
Just he knows all this...
Excuse me sir its a big
word for me but
you have a few honest
peoples in your company.
When I saw him at first time I
feels that he is a cleaver boy.
Your judgment can not be
wrong specially about me.
Don't remind me.
I can't forget his face.
So this project is confirmed deal?
This project belongs to him now.
We are enjoying everything well
when our dreams come true.
Do you know they will get married
untill this project will get over.
But what's your opinion
about all this?
About what?
I mean Marriage, wedding.
Its very hard to get an
honest guy in todays world.
By the way which kind
of guy do you like?
Inteligent...
Means like me...
And the most important
thing is that... - What?
His must have to be 6 feets tall.
5.10" is not well.
No only 6 feet.
Ms. Haseena what are you
doing here I am looking for you.
I am doing rehearsal for carnivale.
I don't know to dance.
Lets dance.
You are not understanding.
Are you in love?
I am in love with priya...
I can't live without her.
I need to talk to you...
Stars, Moon, wind, clouds. Every one

You are dancing well. - Ma'm I can't talk

Please try to understand.
Yes tell me.
I love her very much and
I can't tell her more lie.
Go and tell hir all truth.

It was the need of that time

Its the truth...
Which is coming from heart.
A true love.
Its a fevor to you...
Go and tell her.
What are you saying we
are not accepting this notice.
You have to accept it its
an order from court.
Do you remember the last notice
which you get before 2 months.
Excuse me what is happening here?
Priya these mans are telling us
to leave this place right now.
Raj was said to Mr. Gill infront of
me that a comunity center and...
Shoping mall will build here.
Which plane are you talking about?
May be they are fooling you
or else you trying to fool me.
There's not any plane
or purposal here.
You have to leave
this place now.
Priya do you belive that Raj is...
Let me meet him to resolve it.
Are you looking for this?
The map of your shoping mall.
Was you submited this plane?
Priya you I knows that you
will not trust me this time.
But the truth is that I was
coming to you with this file.
To tell me that
you are a big lier.
And you are a fraud.
Priya let me explain
you are thinking wrong.
Its simple raj...
You cheat us.
You has played with our
emotions and our lives.
Actually that comunity center
was never a part of your purposal.
Why you lied? Because you are
not agreed to know the reality.
I tried to explain you...
Priya your comunity center can
not being a part of this project.
I am lost...
You are such a player.
You did not let me feel that
what is cooking in your mind.
Its a bussines world...
The world of real estat.
Every one is concerned
to his benifit.
These rich mans are not
careing of our emotions.
What if I will try my best...
But you have to try it at once.
You know what will happen.
Another man will get this project...
Yes but I am not loving
that other man.
I love you raj.
How can you do this?
Are you looking these madals
all these are mine.
All collage mates was used to saying that
Raj will be on the cover of Time magazine...
5 years are gone...
But where am I now?
A master mind with bad luck
its a very danger combination priya.
It will force to do every thing.
If you was strugling for your own then
who gave you the licince to cheat others?
Why you used me to build
this shopping mall
Because my every work will finish
well when you are with me.
When some one told me about that
so I replyed him same like you.
But I have to accept it now.
When you thrown my
card I got the work.
And when you pushed me that
day in that imposible shot.
It just became possible.
She revised her daughter
when she looks you.
Every time when you were with me
then my every work will become done.
Okay when your works will
done well in my presence
then why you cheat us
in our own purposal.
You just let it happen.
I was standing with you.
You are not beliving on
your belive... its the truth.
The truth is Raj...
...that you
didn't faith what you believed.
But I was trusted on you, Raj.
I loved you.
I loved you, Raj and you lied to me.
You got your contract,
Your job has done.
Now may I go.
Don't go,
I just need you,
nothing else.
And here's your cheque.
Thankyou very much.
What you've done Raj?
This house was only thing that was
yours and you put it on morgage.
Let's take this cheque.
And since today how much money we
took from anyone, we give them back.
And I want after today you should
away from this tension.
Raj!
Listen to me, Raj.
They will never agree, community
centre can't be a part of mall.
You'll be finish,
No matter what it takes.
It's my luck.
Hi! Uncle!
What happen?
You didn't wave me today,
Sorry!
My concentration was somewhere else
I forgot it,
You're saying something and your
eyes are saying something else.
It's matter of love,
Fought with boyfriend.
And it was me who trusted him alot.
Which guy makes you cry I'm telling
you forget about him, Go.
But I heard that he's changed.
He put his everything because of me.
That's wonderful, great then forgive
him.
And If he lies again then?
And think this time he's saying truth
then would you ever forgive your self.
Look!
First he made a mistake.
And if you won't go today then may be
you'll be on mistake, come on just go
Come on, I'll come with you,
You will come too.
There must be some meaning of our
waving relationship.
We have to go city council hall.
City Council Hall?
He has a most important presentation
and he want to along with him.
Becaue he thinks that I'm lucky for
him, you won't understand just go.
Then like this to use existing
foundation we can get a profit of 18%.
But what I'm going to say,
Listen it very carefully.
It's the new revise design of shopping
mall.
At one side there will be shopping
centre and we accomodate a
community centre another side.
Gill! What rubbish?
There must be some misunderstanding.
Raj! What the hell is this?
What are you saying?
Mr. Gill if it's your reccomendation
then I want this architect out,
Which company's presentation?
Some Patra and Gill.
They just worry about their money
they don't care about other people
All of them are just misers,
old buggers.
How did you present this absent plan
to board?
Mr. Gill what is this?
This sound rediculous.
Frankly, I don't think you can handle
this project,
Ladies and Gentlemen, I don't think
Mr. Gill can handle this project,
You won't do this project,
Excuse me!
How dare you talk to Mr. Gill like
that? Excuse me! Madam.
You sit down you don't know him.
Raj! Show the right designs rather
than you're out.
These are the right designs,
for everyone.
Please listen to me for two minutes
before take any decision.
They are living there since long, In
removing them from there legally
I'm right.
But morally you're wrong,
We know young man.
We invest our money.
Our business should run,
That's it.
Why do we care other things,
You are absolutely right.
Mountains, Rivers, world's demolishing
why do we care, just business should
be run.
Big country is pressurising little
world, million of people are dying
keep silent, why do we care?
Business should be run, before I
was thinking the same.
But one day someone force me to
think about this.
That how much I become down to
move up in my life.
So! What do you want to say? This
business expention shouldn't happen,
If there will be progress then it'll
be benefit for everyone.
I'm not against progress, but whose
and on which price,
And who will decide this price,
You'll decide it, and you also.
Come on,
Let's forget about human grounds,
Let's see the business advantages of
this project, for 10 sec's publicity
How many crores you spend, think
tomorrow morning's newspaper headline
A leading construtction company helps
the helpless, that will be news.
Your benefit is including with their
benefit, you just have to change your
view, In this race of profit where
calculations, profit, balance sheet
dollars, rupees, paisas, 2-4,
4-8
every morning you woke up and you
says look sensex is going up
like this our race didn't finish but
our lives become end,
Ladies and Gentlemen!
How many designs I've made since
today, It's the best of all of them.
Because my heart's including it,
It includes everyone's progress.
It's good for everyone.
And you know what?
Whatever I said here, I know it's a
lose for me more than others.
But someday, somone have to think
forward than profit and loss.
These kind of desicions didn't come
again in life.
That was a good speech,
Very impressive.
But you present a wrong design.
Therefore, you're disqualified.
I recommend this contract should
be given to Dev Kataria.
I couldn't save community centre,
No! Raj you tried.
And you know what,
I'm really proud of you.
Ladies and Gentlemen!
Please sit down, if you don't mind.
Yes! All of you, thank you,
That's my waving friend.
Yeah! Thankyou! Those people who
don't know me, I should tell them
my name is Rajiv Batra, A little
founder of Batra and Gill.
After hearing the complete discussion
I've been decide that
this young man Raj Malhotra,
he really speaks about progress,
He gave us a new view about business.
A human touch.
I don't want that today's
generation call us, what we say?
Bugger, Misers.
So, today to using my veto power
I'll give the contract of this
shopping mall plus community centre
to Raj Malhotra.
