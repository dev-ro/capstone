TIME FOR HAPPINESS
Aren't you bored?
I do not understand. - Neither do I, but I tried.
I see you like art. - Somehow, yes.
If you want, I can explain this work to you. - Here you go.
Do you know why the sculpture is in the aquarium? - Why?
That the price is higher.
So the artist actually wants to tell us
that an aquarium is worth more than its work?
That's right. - What a stretch. - Big.
We could put something like this together.
You think so? –Large aquarium with a muscular statue ...
I have no idea what this is about. Do you know?
Maybe the artist wants to present loneliness to us.
The loneliness of one body in the infinity of the ocean.
Or he communicates that he is alone, but that doesn't bother him too much.
Maybe it's Pontus. –Pontus? Yes, the god of the sea.
Who would have thought that such a tanned muscle man knows mythology.
Thanks for the insult, but when I tell you the story, you’ll see how much I know.
What story? - About Pontus, the god of the sea.
Pontus fell in love with a mortal woman, so his immortality was taken away as punishment.
It was like losing his power and fame to him.
He thought his beloved would not like him like that anymore.
Therefore, in order to find his divinity again, he could only resort to ...
to the bottom of the ocean.
Because everything in the water looks bigger,
he hoped the girl would find him there and love him again.
But unfortunately he didn't think she was an ordinary mortal
and she will not be able to seek him forever.
According to legend, Pontus is still waiting for his beloved at the bottom of the sea.
I don’t remember that story. -Me neither.
But if this artist told me now,
would buy this creation right away.
Did you invent it? - Stories are good for sale.
What are you selling? -No.
Be happy ... - Are you a god of joy?
Good joke. What do you do?
Mert Sonmez, bodisrecen.com.tr
My name is Ada. Ada Altunay.
We just talked about you. How are you? I'm Mert ... - I'm not very well.
But don't worry.
Happiness is a stage of joy caused by constant, full access to everything you want.
Happiness is when you stop running and face yourself.
When you live the life you want to live.
Happiness is gaining respect.
Success brings money, money respect, respect self-confidence.
Self-confidence gives you the golden key to freedom.
But the rules are important.
Real happiness is when you are perfect.
Just like that, you can get everything.
Call a taxi.
Real happiness is when you are perfect.
Just like that, you can get everything.
This is the first time that the sultan does not get what he wants.
Good morning, Uygar. - Don't think too much.
You should conquer Asia, but you’re not dressed yet.
Mater, is it danes?
I don’t want my works to be just a decoration in the homes of others.
I was very patient.
I understand.
I understand, and I have no intention of selling. Thanks anyway.
Son, get your eyes out fast, we're late. Quick.
Good morning, darling. Get up, you'll be late.
Come here, kid. Go out.
Are you okay? - Seven.
Why do you have yellow eyes? - Yellow?
You have too much work, huh? -No.
I told you to quit. I have a job.
I have to go, breakfast is ready. Chocolate pancakes, your favorite.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
I have to go, but don't forget to have dinner together. Not to eat sooner.
Right. -I'll see you.
Where did we stay?
A successful man does not waste a day thinking
that he is invisible, unhappy. That she is a loser.
If you think that experiencing success is a coincidence, you are wrong.
Successful people always win, they always get what they want.
When does your life collapse? When others decide for you.
Life is the way you choose it.
Get off. - How long will you be invisible?
Believe in yourself. Unleash your potential.
Be Alpha. When did you lose your way?
There are two types of man.
Winners ...
Good afternoon, Mr. Dead.
Good day.
And everyone else.
You can't see.
Good morning everybody! -Good morning!
Are you ready to make 10 people happy? - We are!
Are you ready to make the world happy? - We are!
Because if we are not happy, we cannot make others happy!
Let's do our best! That's real energy. Great!
Good morning.
We need to get rid of those unhappy faces and repeat ...
Only I can control my life.
Only I can control my life.
Just be inspired.
The real happiness is to know that you are perfect.
Without mistakes.
bodisrecen.com.tr is not just a website.
It's an idea. Motto.
It’s not just a call center or personality training.
I call this the Land of Happiness.
We are like a school. When you are with us
you are happy until your departure.
So you need to start with yourself.
That's right. No one here knows what it means
to be unhappy.
Which means no one is unhappy with us.
I'm holding you. - Someone knows I exist.
Are you okay? –Sam, Mr. Dead. What about you?
Come here.
Who are you? And what are you doing here?
Tarýk sem.
I work in your accounting.
I'm sorry to make you angry. Forgive me, Mr. Dead.
Stop it.
Is this recipe for happiness suitable for everyone?
Of course, of course.
I take this and go. - Just go.
Would it work on him too?
It works without exception.
If he achieves happiness within a month, we will sign a contract.
One month? - Yes.
We'll see in a month if he's still suicidal,
or if he has become a happy man,
respected and perfect. Such as in your ads.
We can just start negotiations.
Mr. Mert, are you talking about me?
See you again in a month? - Let's go.
Why did you want to kill yourself? - Please?
Kill? I didn't.
Good afternoon, miss. Asuman, sem Tarık.
How are you, miss? Asuman? How are you?
I like you, miss. Asuman, do you know that?
Mr. Tarcan? - I'm not Tarcan. Tarýk is my name.
From accounting.
That's all.
What are you planning?
What are you planning, Mr. Dead?
I'm just a lonely employee.
If you let me, I would go back to work. Please.
From now on you will be a project. - What project?
It's okay, Tayfun, you can go. - I'm not Tayfun, my name is Tarýk.
Either way, you can go.
Did you see? What do you think?
Did he want to say something? No.
Now we know he's lonely? Yes.
Plan ...
He already has a job. It just dresses better and holds up better, and we end up with Asians.
He prefers to focus on that other plan.
The Romans knew him as Jupiter.
He was the god of heaven and thunder.
My darlings, the statue of Zeus was one of the seven wonders of the old world.
In 435 BC. it was created by the famous sculptor Fidias.
Zeus was the most powerful of all the gods.
But Zeus was also a great womanizer.
That would be enough for today. You can go, thank you.
What are you doing here? - When do I come looking for you?
For dinner. - Do you know what the word "no" means?
Don't be like that, well. - Are you leaving alone, do you need help?
Are you kidding? - At eight, then.
You're in my studio.
Opal.
Do you like it? - Very.
If you want, I can interpret for you. - Great, whatever he chooses.
This statue represents the beauty, charisma and self-confidence of a man.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.
But this man doesn't want strong ties,
so he invites women to dinner.
First to a popular restaurant, then to an elegant club ...
He charms women with his body and dark eyes ...
That when he invites them to his home, they will quickly agree.
There he offers them a glass of wine, plays good music ...
and makes love to them.
Unfortunately ...
each drives before morning.
He only understands one word. "Go."
Such men like to wake up on their own in the morning.
They don’t want to meet women or share anything with them.
What happens if the figures don’t come together, even if only for a moment?
How do I know if you're doomed?
There is?
What happened? Who is this beauty?
Nobody.
He has too much perfume.
Something is definitely going on. Tell me everything.
Don't sausage, Denise. It's nothing. -Who is this? Tell.
Let’s call him the cat looking for the next bridesmaid.
Ada, you finally found a man!
I already have a man in my life. Brother. You know that well.
How long are you going to pedal him?
Until he can take care of himself.
Honey, it's not your fault. You know that well.
Get it over with. - I decided and the point.
Pika ... Did you at least fix it? - Sam, I'm going there tomorrow.
Great news. I'll go with you.
Right.
Uygar, find me someone. It is necessary.
Life is a happy toy ...
What are you talking about?
We've had time for him for a whole month, where are you in a hurry?
You're throwing me out of work, aren't you?
I could try harder if you give me a chance ...
Please give me another chance. - It would be good to get to know him better.
He works in accounting.
Full name: Tarýk Altunay. Is something dawning on you?
Last time you didn’t look too happy.
Well, it wasn't exactly a happy event, was it? I had no reason to be happy.
Are you ready to win? - Where to win?
Everywhere.
So come on. –First rule:
No one should find out about it.
Rule number two: No one should find out about this.
Third ... - I understand, I won't tell anyone. Everything stays between us.
What is it? - A bag from the times when I went fishing with my father.
I wear it out of habit. I have money, bills inside ... Mathematics just lies to me.
Get rid of her right away. And these welding goggles too.
Welding goggles? I just take my wallet.
Am I throwing this in the trash? - Come on.
The glasses are not welding. - Go with them.
So take off your clothes. - Please?
Die down!
Here? - People will judge you by their appearance.
This will give you a chance to get them interested.
Would you like to waste it? - Wasted what?
The guy is wonderful, what else would you like?
I don’t care what it looks like because it has nothing inside anyway.
How do you know if you don't know him at all?
What about all these prejudices? How do you know he's a womanizer?
It's obvious. - What's obvious?
It's obvious.
What's obvious, huh?
The last time he flirted in the museum with anyone who came by.
Should I just be with you? - What would you like to say?
Do yourself a favor. - What kind?
Indulge.
I think I saw something ...
Of course you are.
Mr. Tarýk, your mustache looks like an insect's nest.
Let me fix them up a bit. - I'm used to them.
I feel like I’m losing my balance.
We will take care of everything.
She also takes care of her hair.
Hair? Hair.
Let's wash them.
Oh, it's over.
Get the phone down. But you will like everything a little more.
I'll turn it off.
Why didn't we buy anything, they had cute things.
It was cute, but it won’t go that way.
We need to find carpenters to make good chairs and tables.
Otherwise it won't work out.
Our anti-capitalist soldier is already afraid of failure.
You're looking at something special, Mr. Dead? -No.
You look good.
Thanks.
You happily ignore every man you are interested in.
If you run away from love, you will never be happy. - What do you mean?
I'm eating. - He was a terrible womanizer.
What about Cem?
Boring. - But?
He hated art. - Salih? -Liar.
Ada, you haven't dated any Salih.
So who was the liar? Fatih? Does not matter. Salih, Fatih, Mert. Everyone is lying.
Dead? - His company sells people happiness for fat money.
Good day sir. A table for one?
I am. - Where would you sit, sir?
Me again. -Welcome.
That's great.
It's me again.
Unbelievable. It really works.
He greeted me immediately. - You have to. - This is the first time this has happened to me.
What do I bring you?
It is a cat that boom.
If you don't know a man, you can't judge him.
This isn't the first time, remember?
It's true. That's because I've already gotten burned.
I supported my brother’s marriage to a woman no one liked. And what happened?
I had no idea what the hell she was.
I'm telling you about this. You can't judge if you don't know the man.
Maybe Mert is an angel in disguise.
Give him a chance, Ada. Let him introduce himself to you.
Great! - I'm calling my brother.
Stop biting him. He's grown up already.
I care about him.
He knows nothing about these plans, right?
I'm sorry, my sister is calling me.
Please? -What are you doing?
We have an inventory. - I hope you're not working overtime.
Not at all, but I won't be home tonight.
Well, I'll be back late.
Don't worry, okay.
What kind of inventory is this? I hear it for the first time.
I don't know, it's a night shift. This is the first time we are doing this.
There is a lot of work to be done with this inventory.
He does a lot of work. I have to put it off.
Okay, don't forget what to eat. –Right.
Well, now it gives me curiosity.
Tell me about yourself. - I look good.
Nice of you to finally notice.
This is the easiest part.
What would you like to know? -Does not matter.
It excites me. - Impossible, Mr. Dead.
Everything I ever tackled, I destroyed.
I have not yet managed to save my marriage, to start a family.
Were you married?
Two months. I loved her very much. My daisy was.
What happened?
One day ... she left me.
She just left.
Tarik. -I'm sorry.
Don't make a scene, Taryk.
I'm so sorry.
Tarik! You're a grown man.
Men? What kind of man?
Don't say you've never ...
You were married.
What about before the wedding?
Tarýk, we drive all over town. Will you tell me where you live?
In Istanbul. - It's my fault!
Do not be angry. Take it easy. Relax.
Damn it.
What is? Take it easy...
Uygar, quickly find me Tarýk's address.
This is my house. How I missed her. Look at her.
It's okay. - Let me show you.
That's the door. Here is the entrance.
Ada is probably asleep, be quiet.
Do you live with your sister? - What should I do?
We have no choice. We live together. Is it important?
All right, go. -Thank you for everything.
Go, no.
You brought me home, and now take me to bed.
Finish what you started.
Rate! Rate!
Rate!
Rate!
Rate? Rate?
I had a strange dream. All because of you.
I dreamed he was watching me sleep.
We talked too much about him. I swear to smell his perfume.
Don't weigh. Put it down. I called you nonsense. Bye.
Good morning. -Good morning.
What happened to you? - What am I supposed to do?
Nothing, just a little change.
Did you sleep in that? –Yeah.
How do I look? With a shirt and everything ...
Are you drunk? –Pil? I.
After the inventory we went to the bar. I can probably drink, right?
Of course.
Don't be like that, please.
I'm going to take a shower. - Just a little.
I baked chocolate pancakes. - Yeah, please don't do them anymore.
I'm watching the line.
I have to make a face mask. You will see the difference.
Good morning.
Are you always like that?
What kind? -Cold.
If anyone deserves it. - Do I deserve it?
Obviously. - What did I do to you?
Please? - What did I do to keep you cold to me?
What do you want? - Proved you're wrong about me.
I know a nice place. Would you have breakfast with me?
I already ate, thanks. - Let's go for coffee.
You really are so lonely. - I'm unhappy, remember?
Fine. So let's go like this.
What are you doing? - I just want to meet you. This is not a crime.
Don't be silly! You are so childish! What are you doing?!
Accept the invitation. I want him to get to know me. -No!
Accept! - Get him out of there. - I said no!
Forget about pride. Aren't I sorry? I am too young for such a death.
Calm down and come back!
Accept the invitation. -No!
Accept! - That's not fun. No!
As you wish.
Accept! -No! No!
Okay, I accept the invitation! You convinced me! I'm going!
Is this a hidden camera?
When you're really ready, send me a signal.
Deduct $ 333,000
and revenue is exactly 666,000.
You made a mistake of almost 20 percent in the calculation.
Mr. Tarýk is a professional.
Fix it, please.
I said math lies to me.
I have to tell you something. - I messed up again, didn't I?
No, you didn’t mess anything up, but something interesting happened.
We met by chance at the show and a few more times later.
Rate?
Come on, let's go. -Where to?
To the gym. - Please?
When are we going to finish this? - Another 30 to 40 pieces.
This copy-paste does not suit our profession.
Ada, you're quiet somewhere.
It's nothing.
I think you kept something from me. - I'm not.
There really is something ...
My brother fell in love.
You know what you need, right? Self-confidence.
You have to trust yourself. -Teach me.
You have to become a real man. - Of course. How?
With training. You have to change the body ...
Taryk, you have breasts.
Don't we all have them?
Brother?
Where are you going? - A little out. Have a drink with friends. Do not worry.
How out? I cooked pasta, we would have dinner together.
Pasta? But if I keep an eye on the line.
I just eat gluten free. Let it flow to you.
What awaits? -I do not know.
Why did this car stop? - Maybe he has a rich mistress.
Maybe he became a gigolo. - Don't get stupid.
He likes older women.
What if he has problems with the mob?
Like in the movies, when the villains put all the blame on the poor.
Shut up! We're going after him, come on.
Fuck you, brother!
Where the hell is he going ?! I'm going crazy!
How do I know ?!
Mafia, I'm telling you. The bears are behind them. -Quiet! Don't clap.
Why are we following him? - Why do you ask nonsense?
My brother is driving into the unknown. That's why we're going after him.
Braateeec !!!
We did it. - He's gone.
He's gone, where did he go ?!
Thank God we're all alive!
Where is Mert? I don't see him. Where is?
They are strangers themselves, what should I talk about?
About global warming. -About what?
Hello. - Hello.
Would you like some? - Please? - Would you like some?
A kiss? - Yes. Open your mouth.
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Listen to me and remember, okay?
Good.
Men and women are not alike. We have control over ourselves,
they love tales of princes and princesses
and the mantra "Find a good husband and watch over him."
Since antiquity, women have had subordination written in their genes.
Which they always oppose. They fought for their rights and won.
You have to convince them that you are hard to win.
They will be willing to do anything to win you over. Also give life.
Is this the end of feminism? - You didn't understand anything, did you? - No.
Again: if they think it's hard to get you,
they will do anything to win you over.
Just try. You will report to me later.
Uygar, watch him, then take him to the hotel. Tonight must be special.
Do I also prepare a special cologne?
Take her where she wants.
Aren't we going together? - There will be nothing.
Can you wrap me this sandwich?
I'll take it to the stray dogs. The poor are hungry. - Right away.
I'm watching you because you're a real hero.
Please? - You're my hero.
Me? - You, me.
A hero who never forgets animals.
The rest mostly think only of themselves.
Cheers.
Come on, let's go.
Megečka me. Kam strike? –Greva.
Wait, slow.
Stop!
Have we arrived?
I think we are, miss.
How do you think he got out of the car?
Only now do you tell me ?! What if something happened to him ?!
Tarık Altunay.
And. Yes, Tarýk Altunay.
Small, plump, bald and mustache ... Yes.
If there is anything new, let me know. Thanks.
Right.
Mr. Officer, it's okay. He's back. Well thank you.
Where are you going ?! You know how worried I was ?!
You're not answering the phone. I canceled all the hospitals, the police ...
I'm here. I came.
Who is that man? –Which ones?
Which ones? The one who picked you up by car!
Did you follow me? - Of course I am. Because I care about you, okay ?!
Did you meet any? - I'm going.
Opala, where are you going?
You'll tell me everything first ... - I'm not a child! Stop it!
I can't grow up like that.
Everything is gluten free. Even bread.
I’m learning to conquer women.
Excuse me?
I’m learning to conquer women. - With whom?
Pri Mehmetu. –Kdo je Mehmet?
A friend from high society.
Since when do you have such friends? - You just don't know him.
Last night, his driver took me to a party.
We spent the night a little. I don't want you to worry. Everything is fine.
Why are you learning to conquer? -Because...
I have no idea about that.
Brother, I'm sorry. I didn’t want to act like you were still a child.
That's right. I'm sorry.
Somehow we have to cut it. It didn't work out very well, did it?
You're right, it could be better, but over the years ...
Enough. -I'm sorry.
Maybe you should give up. Obviously it won't work out. - Not that.
What is it? - She's the reason I work here.
What do you mean? - I accepted the job because of her.
Fuck! I inadvertently liked his photo!
I liked his photo. I liked it!
I can't undo that. Can I undo this?
She sent a signal. -How?
What? It's nothing...
Lessons of conquest? -I.
Just who would this rich Mehmet be? -I have no idea. He didn't tell me anything.
How sweet you are!
What a sweet creature! - We have to go.
All right, go. Bye Bye.
Your phone is ringing. - I don't have it with me.
Then your purse rings. -Purse? Impossible.
See? Advertise. - If it's not mine.
Advertise.
Please? -Hi how are you?
Good trick. What's next? Will you send me balloons?
Ofcourse not. Away with the balloons!
No balloons! - Obviously you know I like dogs.
Can I expect a puppy? - No, honey.
Delete the puppies. - I still have some suggestions.
I'm a sculptor. He could set me up with some living statues along the way.
A connoisseur of women like you certainly finds himself.
Well, no. Seriously.
Because you are different from everyone else.
You sent me a signal. - Well, I didn't.
So? Tomorrow at ten?
I have a surprise for you.
Just don't get mad at me. Please.
I'll send you the coordinates.
Did he say "coordinates"?
It's over there, mate.
OK thanks.
I didn’t expect us to watch the races.
We won't. -What?
We will race. - What?
Come on, let's go. It will be fun, you will see.
Asuman from Be Happy at Phone Can I Help?
Hello, miss. Asuman, Taryk on the phone.
Hello, Mr. Tarik. How can i help you?
With a bill of exchange.
I do not understand.
Ms. Asuman, always brighten my morning.
You are ... my daily treat.
You're perfume in the elevator,
the angel of my day.
You are...
created for me.
Mr. Tarýk, thank you for these compliments ... Maybe we know each other?
Of course we know each other, miss. Asuman.
Would you go to dinner with me? What do you say?
Of course. Right.
That would be all, miss. Asuman.
Then ... see you.
See you, miss. Asuman.
It worked. I did it.
Mr. Mert has a race today. Are you going to watch too?
Just a little. Where is Mr. Dead?
At the racetrack. He has free time today. - What racetrack?
Off-road. - What? - Let's cheer, come with us.
Gladly, I have to tell him something personally.
Let's go, and they'll talk. -Lets go.
Because?
Who are these two?
He's so familiar to me, but I don't know where from.
Who are you?
How are you, Mert? How are you?
Your co-driver is a real lady.
I wish you good luck, you will need it.
What do I have to do?
Come on, drive, fast!
They're close, watch out!
Quick, quick!
Damn it!
Vodiva, no ?! - Come on!
Smile.
What happened? - We won.
Won? You can stop now.
No, we have to keep going. I would still drive.
This is my house.
Are you kidding? -Not.
This is my house. -What a coincidence.
Seriously? - Yes, this is my house.
I love it, beautiful garden, lots of flowers.
Strange outfit, right? -I.
It was a difficult track. - Really, very difficult.
Well, now I'm going. - I can't stop you.
Would you like something to drink? Tea, coffee?
The second time, I'm all dirty.
Of course, some other time. When cleaner.
It's hard to get out. What about overalls?
We're going to race, aren't we?
Of course ... Well, see you.
We ran out of fuel.
Just so you know, he usually doesn’t behave that way.
Come on, son, down. Come on. - Son?
My brother and I were thinking of buying him a friend.
Satellite.
Do you live with your brother?
What about the rest of the family?
Only the two of us stayed.
What does the brother do?
He works in the accounting of a retail chain.
Retail chains? - He deserves more.
I could get a much better job than with some dealer.
What do you mean?
He has been interested in mathematics since he was a child. He is a mathematical genius.
He studied mathematics and had plenty of opportunities after graduation.
Important world universities invited him to their place. But he didn't go.
Why? - When our parents died in a car accident, he changed his mind.
Probably because he didn't want to leave me alone. - And you dedicated your life to him.
I have to tell you something.
I'm sorry.
Please?
What's happening? I couldn't even see you.
Just a cloud of dust. I have good news.
I have a date. - Well done, congratulations.
I've tried before, but it never worked. I'm on my way home.
We're going to make a plan tomorrow, okay?
Okay, I can. Tomorrow, all right.
Adijo. Prav. Chav-chav.
I have something urgent, I have to go now. –Right.
See you later ... I'll see you, right?
Thank you for everything. For today, I think.
Chav. - What about the car?
The car ... I'll pick it up tomorrow.
There is!
Hi, bro. - How are you, honey?
Good, and you. -I am great.
Was Deniz visiting? -No.
Someone else ... I met someone.
Marička. When? –No ...
I met him some time ago.
Who is?
You don't know him, but don't worry, I'll introduce him to you.
Ada, I know they just started,
but tell this guy
that if he hurts you, I'll tear his balls off.
Good.
Well, what about you? Why are you in such a good mood? Tell.
Because I have a very good friend.
He helped me a lot. - Are you rich, Mehmet?
And.
Tell him if he hurts you, I'll tear his balls off.
I think I'll give up.
Don't sausage.
Be collected. - I'll be right back.
Where are you going? - To the toilet.
Now? And right now ?!
Corrupt! Go away!
I apologize! - Asshole!
I was wrong. Excuse me. -What's happening?
He followed me. The fool was watching me on the toilet.
It's not like that at all, I'm just nervous ...
How dare you? That's my wife!
Leave my friend alone, otherwise ...
Is he your friend, Mr. Mert? - There was only a misunderstanding.
No need to fret.
I don't understand anything, but it was nice when you told me a friend.
You're my hero, seriously.
Hurry, Asuman will be here soon. - I just jump on the toilet.
Hurry up, no.
This one isn't ... this one is going to be real.
You will be alone with a woman tonight, Asuman will be ready to surrender to you.
When she enters, she follows some rules.
Don't look at her until she approaches the table.
I know you'll stare when he enters.
Everything will be like in slow motion.
Everything will be quiet, only beautiful music will be heard.
I can already hear the music.
Asuman. - Tarik.
Slowly pull her to you and kiss her. Slow.
Leave her space.
When he kisses you, he puts his hand on her belt. Let him know you took control.
Be a cavalier, make her comfortable. And then sit down.
Now you just have to call the waiter.
Shall I call him? - Wait!
Right. It's nothing.
On a first date, time alignment is important.
This will make a really good impression on her.
Wait for my signal. Wait.
Wait a minute. Wait.
Now.
Excellently executed.
Now is the time to rest, it’s her turn to impress you.
What are you doing? - I'm going better.
Where? - Get away from all the hustle and bustle.
I whine like a horse, and you write love messages.
Who is? If he doesn't love you, I'll take care of you.
No. - No, what? - What are you doing here?
Asuman is in the toilet.
I have a tremor, I came to calm me down. -Come here.
Are you drunk? -Just a moment.
Don't drink, don't dance and don't sing. Otherwise you will destroy everything. Repeat.
I can't drink, dance or sing ...
Now what?
She will take your hand. -How?
You ask too much. Return to the table. –Right.
Literally repeat after me. "See that couple?"
Me, her. "They'll be pouring a drink soon."
See that couple?
Yes. - They'll have a drink soon.
"The waiter will bring ..." - The waiter will bring a cake with a ring.
"Neighboring couple are not guests ..." - Neighboring couple are not guests. They are musicians.
"The man will go to his knees ..." - The man will go to his knees and ask her.
Would you marry me?
"The woman will accept and ..."
The woman will accept and ...
How did you know?
"If you want, I can guess ..." - If you want, I can guess our story.
Here you go.
"Unfortunately ..." - Unfortunately, the girl will be late for work tomorrow.
Why? - "After dinner, they'll drink a little more ..."
After dinner they will drink a little more, the girl will invite him to her ...
"With her, they will arouse each other between kisses ..."
At her...
they will kiss ...
aroused each other ...
"In..."
–In...
"In..."
–In... –In?
"The girl will experience the most beautiful night ..."
The girl will experience the most beautiful night of her life.
What is it?
Nothing, everything is under control.
It's your night, enjoy.
You are amazing.
Can I go with you?
Far away from all the hustle and bustle? - I'll send you the coordinates.
Calm down, man. Don't worry.
Oh, g. Mert.
You're at a wedding. In his favorite shirt and all tanned.
Hello. - Hello.
No worries, they only have space for you.
As long as I'm not the groom, I'll survive.
Here you go.
Ms. Asuman, there is no need to take off.
Still this with the missus. Come here!
What did I do? I moved your ass.
Why did she move? -Come here!
So, Captain, where are we going now?
I'd like to show you something.
This is a surprise for my brother.
A surprise?
Where are we?
When I was little, we had a bar here. My mom served,
father and brother were grilling and cooking.
The cash register was there by the side and of course her brother took care of it.
With his purse on his belt. He was so cute.
I, however, did not go out of the water until I was cold.
We experienced and shared many things here.
We spent wonderful moments together.
Unfortunately, we had to sell.
My brother and I wanted to study, so we moved to the city.
If I could go back ...
Anyway, this is mine again.
So that my brother would work here. I know how much he loves this place.
Everything is ready.
You have some credit for that, too.
Me? How? - Because you bought a statue of Pontus.
You deserve to have reached my goal sooner.
I started selling my work so I could buy this one.
And not just locals,
i also bought our birth house.
Come on, let's go to the pier.
She would like to get her brother out of the madness of the big city.
Here we can start again.
He has a pure heart, he is good. That’s why he’s so sensitive.
I don’t want him to ever suffer again.
What about you?
Me? - You.
Your parents. What are they like? - It's my turn now.
My father died six years ago.
I'm sorry. - Now only Uygar is my family.
My father trusted me to him.
What about mom?
You said I only understood the word "Go."
I only wanted to ask someone not to leave once.
When I called my mom, don't leave us.
We are both prisoners of our past.
With only one difference ...
You got lost in yours.

Where is Ms. Asuman? -What are you saying? I am.
Who? - Asuman.
Come on, make me breakfast. I love pancakes.
Please? Yes, I am. Do I have to go there right away?
Okay, I'm going.
Good morning. -Good morning.
Am I helping you? - No, everything is ready.
Do you know that you are our first guest?
Let it flow.
It looks great.
So what's going on?
Brother? - I just wanted to tell you that I love you.
I love you too.
Where are you? I have only just arrived.
I'm on an island. Come on.
What are you doing there? - You'll see when you arrive.
Come on, I'm waiting for you. - All right, I'll be right there.
Sooner or later I would find out about this.
He can find out now. What do you say?
Now? Of course. You can.
Everything is ready anyway. Why would I procrastinate?
And he'll be able to meet you.
Great.
But today I have to go. What do we do?
Okay, second time.
Deal.
Do you know that you are our first guest? -Thank you.
He didn't want to leave me alone. - And you dedicated your life to him.
We are both prisoners of our past.
I started selling my work so I could buy this one.
I have to tell you something. - You got lost in yours.
I'm on an island. Come on.
A connoisseur of women like you certainly finds himself.
Well, no. Because you are different from everyone else.
This place ... - It's yours again. Ours.
How? - I bought it. And a house.
Are you serious?
Lover.
I can not believe. My darling.
Brother ...
What about you here? This day is always more beautiful.
What are you doing here? Ada, this is my friend.
Those from the lessons.
About conquering women? - Conquest?
No, I just wanted to help him gain a little self-confidence.
Anyway, it's not that important.
That's my sister. And yes, you are Mehmet.
Tarik. - Hell, the most beautiful sister in the world.
This is my only friend. Friend Mehmet.
Tarýk, we ... - Hi, I'm glad, Mehmet.
Enako.
How did you find us? What are you doing here?
Did you hunt babe again? Still?
No, I was with friends. - What kind of friends?
Such ...
It doesn't matter. Do you know why we're here?
That's where we all grew up. My parents and I lived here.
Ada bought this as a surprise for me.
Brother, aren't you curious about the house? You don't want to see her?
And how. Are you waiting for me? You're in no hurry, are you?
You just go, bro.
How do you know my brother? - From the company.
Ada, when I came to university ...
When I left your studio, I heard your conversation ...
You told your friend you had to take care of your brother.
You took advantage of your brother to win me over. - No, I just wanted to make you happy.
But first I had to make him happy. That's all.
I know that ...
it's all weird.
Ada, I didn't mean to ... - Disappear.
Ada, I'm sorry.
For the first time in my life ... - Disappear.
You got what you wanted.
Get out of our lives.
Return to your perfect world.
The playground is still standing. Nothing has changed.
Where is Mehmet? - He was in a hurry somewhere.
Brother ...
What if I started here again? New life.
This time I will take care of you.
It's my turn.

Ada! I have a great idea.
I could teach. You know, private lessons.
The school management would give you permission. What do you say?
Maybe I'll see. -What happened?
Nothing special. - I got an email.
What is this? Is it in Chinese?
No, it's Tarýk's mail. I thought it was mine.
What is it?
Ada, look at this.
I hope you're okay, Mr. Tarik. I got your email address at the company.
We met on a sad occasion. I hope you found happiness.
See you soon, Sun Yeong.
What do you understand?
What is it about?
Brother?
What happened?
Tile Asians in the photo sent you a message. What is it about?
Jackie Chan, saj res.
Would you like to tell me something?
Why didn't you tell me you worked there?
I know you don't like companies like that. I was afraid you would get angry.
I didn’t want to admit to you that I accepted the job because of Asuman.
I'm sorry.
Didn't you really throw yourself off the balcony? - No, I didn't mean to kill myself.
I accidentally fell. And then...
would almost really kill himself. Mert grabbed me and saved me.
He saved my life.
Not just life, Ada ...
I didn’t tell you, but I was really at the bottom then.
If I’m so confident now, I can only thank Mert.
He saved me. He was watching over me, almost fighting over me.
He's my only friend.
What about these Asians? - They made a deal with Mert.
But only under one condition.
What kind?
If he turns me into a happy man in a month.
We can still cancel it all together.
A man wants two things: success and happiness.
We are here to see if this is feasible at all.
One month ago, Mr. Merta asked for proof
that happiness can be created from nothing.
Let him prove that he can restore the will to life to the desperate.
I can name Tarýk.
Je g. Are you talking about us?
Mr. Mert, where is Mr. Tarik?
Where he is happy.
Far away from the crowds.
There are several definitions of what it means to be really happy.
Starting with the need to be beautiful and perfect.
I believed those lies.
I convinced everyone of that, making millions on that account.
But I was wrong.
Have you ever heard of devotion and compassion?
I didn't know them myself.
Do you know what real success is?
A brother who forgets his own dream of not leaving his sister.
That's real happiness.
The greatest happiness is a brother who sacrifices his life for his sister’s happiness.
Perfection is not real happiness.
Perfection is a recipe for grief.
A perfect man is an unhappy man.
In...
love ...
Love is the greatest imperfection of this world.
Aren't you bored?
I do not understand. -Me neither.
I listened to everything, but understood nothing.
Then you're a bad listener.
Not so bad again.
If you want, I can interpret that for you.
Whatever you choose, the stage is yours.
Do you know why the speaker is talking about himself instead of the company?
Why? - That the price is higher.
So the speaker says this company is nothing special,
that everything is just deception. Is that right?
That's right. - What a stretch.
Great.
Maybe this speaker ...
he just wanted to say that he missed the happiness he finally found.
That he didn’t want to leave the woman who really made him happy.
You try too hard. I would just tell her you miss her.
What...
What if I tell you I love you? Is this okay?
If I tell you I'm only happy with you?
Who would have thought that such a tanned muscle man is capable of romance.
Thanks for the insult, but when I tell you the story, you will agree.
What story? About Pontus? -No.
Ours.
