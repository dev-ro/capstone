{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Eat slowly! - Eh?
- And stretch your legs out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I said stretch them out and eat properly.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Stretch your legs out like this, mum.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Just stretch them out, woman.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Stretch them out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- I can't.
- Why not? Stretch them out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They hurt.
- So? --Stretch them out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Like that.
Out, so they don't go numb.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I can't.
- Okay.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Have it your way.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's no reasoning with you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This leg moves slowly.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Of course it moves slowly.
You made it moves slowly.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I said 'stretch'.
You don't listen.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Oh dear... I'm dying fo water
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>My dear daughter...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Mum...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Mum.
- Eh?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Can you see the light?
- I can.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There it is.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I can see with this eye
but not withe the other.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you want me to take you out
into the sun tomororrow?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I can't go out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You can't take me out.
I become like a tree.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'm not dying.
I'm just making your life a mysery.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Not dying.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And I don't intend to die.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I eat bread. I drink water.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I eat whatever I want.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mashalla! Mashalla!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>One half fo me, one half for you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take a bit.
A spoonful or two.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Open your mouth.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't give me honey.
- Just a bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's honey. Just honey.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Just a bit woman. Wait.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- I don't want to.
- A tiny bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Just a tiny bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I sell it for 16 euros.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's straight from beehive,
with honeycomb in it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Very good.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Taste it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why is yours so cheap?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>The prices are lower because the demant has fallen.
It's not selling well. - I see.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mine sell well, even though
it's more expansive.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Some times up to 20 euros.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Other time down to 10 or 15 euros.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Are you Bosnian?
- Albanian on my father's side, Bosnian on my mother's.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Very good.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>All the Albanians and Turks left our village
except for us and we're Turks
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>I don't remember those families.
I was born in 1964.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Right. Right.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Not all honey a remedy,
especially if it's mixed.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>People add sugar to make more of it.
But mine is raw.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Thank you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's a red honeycomb, made as a cure.
- To cure?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Yes, specially made to cure.
- Very nice.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We'll, take a deal, don't worry.
Normally it's 16 euros, but I'll cut the price for you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't worry, I'll lower the price.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I have pure honey at home.
Only in winter, though. I'll come back then.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Anh I'll bring you a jar as a present.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't worry, I'll filter it.
For you to put in your tea and enjoy.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Have you found anything?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'm looking for hair dye.
Chestnut colour.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Chestnut?
- Yes.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This is chestnut.
That's what I need.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This is a nice one.
- Yes, that one. How much is it?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>2,50 euros.
- That's very expensive, isn't it?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take the chestnut.
It's really nice.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Yes, it is.
- This one's nice. Chestnut.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll buy this too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>For my mother. She's ill.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>She's 85.
- How old? 85? And ill, too?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Four years in bed now.
- Don't pay then. It's for your mother.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>May she be sound and safe.
It's a souvenir from Skopje.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Thank you so much.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mum.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Get up.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'm back from Skopje. Let's eat.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You went to Skopje?
- Uh-huh.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I went and sold some honey there.
- Eh?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I WENT there and SOLD the honey!
- Why?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I went to sell some honey!
- Aha...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>And I bought some bananas.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What's this?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's a fan to cool you down and chase the flies away.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>That's right.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You'll choke! Wait a bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take it easy. Smaller bites.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is it good?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hold this and feel.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Can you feel it?
- It's beautiful.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's a tail, mum. A peacock's tail.
Be careful not to poke your eye.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Wait. Like this.
Not like that. You'll poke your eye out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Like this.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This way mum, this way.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Did you sell the honey?
- Uh-huh.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>How much for?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>As much as I could. 10 euros a jar.
- Eh?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>10 euro a jar.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They're Turkish.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Open your mouth.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Open again.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come on! Come on!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Slow down!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They are coming out!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bring it here. Alcho!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Turn it!
So they can come back.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Baby!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Well, you mean that?
How's the calf?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Kiss me, kiss me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is it nice?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What are you doing?
Did you come to see my mother?
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>She's asleep.
See?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you want kitten?
Want to take one?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Wich one do you want?
White? Ginger? Or this one?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Are we going out?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You want to stay here or go outside? Eh?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Want to go outside?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let's go.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Way to go!
You've already broken something?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>He pusched her and she fell on her chest.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>She fell by herself and broke my leg.
May your head fall off, Alit!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's nothing. Nothing.
- He injured her chest.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>Come here, Gamze, let me see.
Gamze, come! Let me see you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>She's hurt badly.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't make a fuss! Shut up, will you!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Just shut up.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>See what he did.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You'll get what's coming to you at home!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You've no idea what's waitting for you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This stick will come down hard on you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You'll see at home.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll make you black and blue all over.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>So you feel her pain.
- She broke my teeth.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll knock every one of your teeth out,
you'll see.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You hit my hand badly.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bring another nail.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There. It's good.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Cloudy weather in Macedonia
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>with more sun in the south in the south east.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>... with moderate winds from
the north becoming stronger...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>tomorrow it will be unstable with...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Is it a different station?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It says Radio Skopje. Listen.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Go on. Sing.
- What are you waiting for?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come on. Come on.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You'll feel pretty.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>A treat for your hair too!
- Just a bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hold it. Easy.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll get your medicine now.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And a banana to eat.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Only if there are still some left.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's one left.
- Who brought them?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I bought them. Who else?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I've already eaten.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Just eat! There are plenty of bananas for today and tomorrow.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This is for today,
the rest are for tomorrow.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll buy new ones when I to go the city.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Go on! Stay in there!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>She's getting up.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Pray to God it's not male.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>Here! Here!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's a male.
Get out of here!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What are you using in the smoker?
Dry dung.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>The honeycomb's ready.
Soon there'll be larvae.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Are those larvae?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I just appply a layer of dung
and they make it themselves.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>How much honey is there?
20-30kg?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No matter how much there is -
there's enough for all of us.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>In a good year 10 kilos.
It depends on the year and the bees.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Anyway I have to leave five kilos.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I want to, but ...
- It's still early...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>There's honey now. But by September it'll be full.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Even next month it will be full.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What price do you sell it for?
- In a good year, 10 euros.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>When do you collect it?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This year in
September or October.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It depends on the weather.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mustafa's closed the place off well.
We'll put them there.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Yeaah. Anh the windows are
all closed up?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- Yes.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What about the beehives?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's clean and closed there.
With no garbage.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No garbage is good for the bees.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Get protected Gamze.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Obviously, just go.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You go, and I'll do this.
- To the truck?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Good. We'll put this here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Give me the pump.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They'll sting us.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Turn it
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Gamze, come here!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bring here.
I'll cut it here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Close it tight!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It'll sting again.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You wacko!
- Shut your mouth! Get lost!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Where?
- Here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Where is the bee?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Good weather,
and plenty of space here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Will you take all of it?
- Eh?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- Are you taking it all?
- No. Just two or three frames.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take that rack and
leave the others...
{\an8}.<font color=lightblue>.. so they don't come
and attack my bees.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's enough for them and for you. There's...
- Yes, yes, there is plenty for everyone.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>These are full. You can collect them.
The other ones need time.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Sure, that's what I'll do.
- You take half, but you leave half.
{\An8}.<font color=lightblue>.. so they don't attack my bees.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Go away! Away! Away!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No man from Skopje
has ever done me wrong.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>I say too myself he's man, so give way a bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>He wanted to confuse me.
He told me each frame was 1,5 kilo.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I asked him:
'Who are you trying to make a fool of?'
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>'Did you weigh them?'
- No, I didn't.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>He claimed he'd weighed them.
- Why don't you get a scale?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I do have one.
It runs on batteries and it breaks easily.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>A digital scale.
- When I weigh, it's always precise.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>My measures are always accurate.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No more from now on it's over.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>All of them need something...
Gamze needs 3 euros.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Veli needs 7 euro,
Ali 0,5 euro.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And then Mustafa...
I give them every thing.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>He relly was bad.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come here!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Pour more brandy.
You hardly poured a drop.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You pay poorly, I pour little!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll pay you, Hatidze.
- It's good quality brandy.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This brandy has messed up many minds!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you know what the old folks say?
- What?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>A village without a river
is no village at all.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Winter is hard.
It is hard. There is hardly any water.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>My older sister died,
whe she was eight...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>I had two other sisters,
who died too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>One was nine...
And other was only 3 months old.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They're all buried over there.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mum?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Eh?
- Get up. Get up for some watermelon.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Have some watermelon.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- Have what?
- Some watermelon..
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I don't want to.
- But it's nice. It's very sweet.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Did they bring it?
- Yes, Ljutvie and Hussein brought it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hold it so it doesn't drip on you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There aren't any smaller pieces.
- They're small!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bite!
They can't be smaller than this.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is it sweet?
- Uh-huh.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's a local watermelon.
No chemicals inside.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Not like the ones,
you buy at the market.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll go to bed.
- Wait.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Cover me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I even had some watermelon.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Will there be any honey?
A kilo or two at least?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>A kilo is not a big deal.
I'll give you one, no problem.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Check if there's a kilo or two...
- I hope there'd be more.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come and take these over there...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Take them.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You're not leaving me
without any honey, are you?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's no...
Let's see this one.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>But without a pump they'll sting us.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let me just take a look, eh?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It looks like there's enough to take.
- No, no, there isn't.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What do you mean?
- I mean there isn't enough.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Put it back.
- The honey's good.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>The honey's good, but there isn't enough.
- It's good.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's not enough.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We're ready.
Let's see how much honey there is.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>When I open it,
blow the smoke with the pump.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>So they don't sting us.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mashallah! There's plenty.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>1, 2, 3... 4 honeycombs.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Now we'll leave them half.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They gave us half,
we'll leave half and close it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bees from breeders who colect their honey earlier...
{\an8}.<font color=lightblue>.. come to my bees...
...and eat their honey.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't take all the honey out!
- I won't.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't take it all out!
- I'm not taking it, just placing it lower down.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>The weather's getting colder.
The upper level...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>The upper level should come out.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>See, it's empty
- Maybe they made it on the other level.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>No they haven't.
- You put it there yourself.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hatidze's hives have honey on both levels.
Ours have none.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Sure they don't.
- Because you're not taking good care.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No, it's because you take their honey.
- No, you're not taking good care.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And no more going to see Hatidze.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you hear me?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you understand me?
- Not at all.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'm doing this for you.
I don't need any of this.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I already have what I need.
It's not much, but it's enough.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>But you don't.
I know how to breed bees.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Get the matches and light the pump.
- I'll get mum to do it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't wait for your mother!
Get the matches and light the fire.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No more going to Hatidze, understood?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I know how it's done.
- My ass you do.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We'll collect our own honey.
- You'll collect my ass.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'm doing this for you.
Only for you, I don't need any of it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You need it, I don't need anything.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Sure you need money for school.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>For clothes.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I bought them everything. Everything!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They disobey me.
Now I won't by them a thing.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Not a thing.
I won't even give them what I have. Not even what I have.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Careful.
Careful with the towel.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What?
- You dropped the towel.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why did you get up?
- To sit for a while.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't pull me!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Everybody likes to look nice mum
- Even me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Who does?
- I do.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I can't hear you, dear.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I don't know if you're cursing or praising...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Don't you kow?
Tomorrow is Hidrellez...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>What?
- Did you know?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why?
- I don't know.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>So desperate for my help?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Rememer when you used to help me?
- The time when I helped have long gone.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>How so?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's so difficult.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Back to bed?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Didn't you say you'd help?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Well, have a rest then.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I can't help you, you know.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Then I won't help you either.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is anyone making you help me?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I want to.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is it night?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's a long time till,
night comes, mum.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- How can I help?
- Just tie my scarf.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Tie it here.
Just a bit.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Where are the ends?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Here, here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Be safe and sound my daughter.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let me give you a kiss now.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let me give you one too.
- Give me one back.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>That's enough.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You say we argue all the time?
That I'm restless?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You may be restless,
but most of all you're reliable.
{\An8}♪'My girl, I'm gonna buy you candies
{\an8}♪before we get married and leave this village!'
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Like it?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Your honey's really good.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Then you're done. Completely done.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come here!
It was a well-deserved victory!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I prayed for you win,
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>and you didn't let me down!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Tuck in! Try this.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This is for you, Hussein.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And some more for you, Hussein.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There enough to eat and drink.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What are you doing, Safet?
Hold on.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Eat like kings!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>So are you okay with the deal, Hussein?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What do you think?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't! Let the kids have it.
Don't give it to me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let the kid have it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let them have it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You can't sell by the kilo.
I need 200 kilos at once.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>So we've closed the deal, right?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>At 10 euros a kilo.
I'll buy 200. I give you my word.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Leave here alone.
Stop bullying her.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Alcho, your father will beat you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You're asking for it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Stand till. It won't sting.
Now low the smoke.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bring the knife!
Are the jars ready, woman?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Bring the big pot first.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And a pan.
- I left the pan there.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It stung me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Oy! Why aren't you coming?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What are you waiting for?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We need to collect honey.
Bring the pan here. And hold it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take the jars to your mum
to wash them. Hurry! Quickly! What is this.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>God forbid anyone ever asks you
to do anything.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Put the mask on.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Put the mask on.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Gamze, hurry. Veli, you too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Veli, come here!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>See this rascal!
He only works when he's force to.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Cut it up!
- It'll sting me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- It won't. Don't be afraid.
- I'm blowing this. You're safe.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Go on, tear it apart!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It stung me too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Cut me right through.
Fucked me up.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Keep smoking!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Veli, don't run away or
I'll cut your head off!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why is the kid not coming?
Is he a kid or what?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Cut me again.
Fucked me up totally.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And a sting on the head too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Get the mask!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Faster, faster!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Who doen't want more?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There are 13,5 kilos here.
13,5 kilos.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>2, 3, 4, 5...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>11.
May you spend it in good health.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What matters now is that,
you collect 20 kilos more.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It must be something else, Hatidze.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What else?
It's your taking it.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>If you ask me it must be the weather.
It's changeable! Must be that.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Look! Not even five left alive!
- It's not because of that, Hatidze.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I told you to leave half!
Look what your bees have done to mine!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We left a frame for each.
- Either you take yours away or I'll move mine!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- There nowhere to take them.
- That's not my problem.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Here I have my kids to help me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- And who will help me?
At least you have children. I have none.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- I still think it's something else.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- I'm asking you to move
your bees away from here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hatidze, where can I take them?
Our house is here.We live here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>And where should I take them?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Nowhere. It's over. They're dead.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No, it's not true!
I swear on my children.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Wait, wait... There are lawyers...
there the court...! Let's settle the dispute there!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>If I go to court, let's see,
what he's do...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>- Don't open it!
- What can he do to me?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>But who is lying to you, Hatidze?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>He told me he took them and
that I should give them...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>We didn't sell any bees or hive or honey.
All of it's here.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I told him it's too early,
that the comb will collapse...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>His father yelled at him,
for collecting the honey, saying...
{\an8}.<font color=lightblue>.. you don't collect honey now.
It's too early.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Aim the smoker directly at the head.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There no dung in it.
- Yes, there is.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It stung me on the face!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't be afraid.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Go collect it yourself!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>As if you brought it yourself,
you filthy dog!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Fuck!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You can force me!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's no reasoning with them.
You're the most responsible one.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Nobody else takes resposibility.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>See these?
They chase our bees away.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It stung me.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They look like flying stars.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Be careful, it might drop on my hair
and set it on fire.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It burn my legs.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>My God, this yawning.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hatidze, why don't you leave this place?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>If I'd had a son like you...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>things would have been different.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>But I don't.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You burned it!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take a look at what you did.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What can I do, Hatidze?
I have to make this fire.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Just think about what you did!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We need new grass.
There no use for the juniper tree.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There'll be no grass for the bees.
- There's no harm.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You need it, but I need it too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- I need to burn. We need new grass.
- I need new grass as well.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I told him to burn it down.
- You've done a good deed!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>If it burn we'll have more grass.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>But look!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Okay, I won't light the fire,
if you take care of my kids.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What can I do if you've set
your mind on it?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What are you waiting for? Move!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Cursed be the neighbours...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>It hurts to see you like this, daughter...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Oh God! It hurts to see you...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>When matchmakers were coming...
you didn't accept any?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I don't know.
- When they were asking for my hand?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I welcomed them and accepted them...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>I accepted them.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Who didn't, then?
- Your father.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Even if there was a chance now,
I wouldn't leave.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why?
- No reason.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't say that.
- Why?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>That's not good.
- There nothing else to do.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>How could I leave you?
- Easy.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll come too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>The son-in-law will take care of us.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let your caretaker be safe and sound.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I won't collect it!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Collect it yourself, you fucking...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Shut up!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I can't believe how much
this woman gets on may nerves!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do not gather.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Throw them on the drawer.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You just sit there.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is it so difficult to believe
there's none left?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You tell me there none,
but let's see if there any.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let's check together.
If there is any, it's no big deal.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- You think I'm laying? Why would I do that?
Who doen't want money... But Hussein...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>All good, but let's take a look...
...and check all the hives to see if there's any...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>We will, but there no point.
There isn't any.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You have some but you aren't
give me any.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Can't you understand
The simple fact there isn't any?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'm not going to open the hives
just to make the bees anxious.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You don't say.
- One year, one kid. - One kid? - Yes.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>- God bless you.
- One year, one kid.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>God bless you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What can we do? We need kids.
They're a real treasure.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Easy.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's very cold.
- What do you mean cold?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Put your legs up. Is that better?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Hold on.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Pull! Faster!
Don't let them drown.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>There's the queen.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>If you were a baby
{\an8} <font color=lightblue>I'd just take you up in my arms and run!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They've killed all my bees.
I have no bees...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>We're left without a solution.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You will die soon. What am I going to do then?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You will die one day.
What will I do then?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Get married.
- Godspeed.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Let them have it their way.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I don't want to have
anything to do with them.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>God will punish them.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Don't you worry to much...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>I can make it without them.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>God will punish them!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>May God burn their livers!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you understand?
Fifty died!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why did they die?
- They were sick.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Should've care more.
I talk, and talk and talk...
{\an8} <font color=lightblue>It looks fine?
- Fine? It looks half dead!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>No care at all!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>This is sick too.
- Yeah, sure!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You take no care!
- No, you take no care.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>I do, and much more ...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Work the land!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You took care?
Look at the buckets! Empty!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Why only me?
Why not Muzo too?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Then you take all the care!
- And let you do what?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Take care by yourself?
- And see you do what?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>God forbid, woman.
Not a bit of care.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Do you think that's okay?
- I have the kids.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What are you doing here at all?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>As if you did.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Sit on your ass all day?
- I did take care.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You fucking...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>They took care of them...
- Sure they did, and good care too, my...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Did you see how many calves died?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You eat all day, but give nothing to them.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You knew it was sick!
- Sick, but not dead!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>It's not just one.
50 have died so far.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>When there's no food for them...
- There is food!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>The bags were full!
Was it so difficult to grind corn?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You have the mill there.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>They can't operate the mill.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You can! But you didn't!
You can only eat but not mill.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What can you do for yourself?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You've spoiled them.
- Do it yourself.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>That's why they misbehave.
But there will be nothing to eat.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I'll bring food.
Not for you, though!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You should feel hunger.
Bees are not enough. We need cattle too.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>We can't survive
without them in this desert.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come to my lap.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Were you cold?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Where have you bean, little kitten?
In the wardrobe?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>What did you eat?
Milk and skimmed cream?
{\An8}.<font color=lightblue>.. and left none for you.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Want some more?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is there more?
- As much as you can eat. I don't want any more.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Throw it away!
Nu du har lavet det.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Didn't you want milk?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>I wanted milk, not 'ayran'.
I don't want it!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Then I'll give it to the cats.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>Spring. Spring.
Can you imagine spring coming?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Spring.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Spring. Spring.
Can you imagine spring coming?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Spring. Spring!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>You like spring coming?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Is there spring?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Sure there is.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Too many winters have passed.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mum, can you hear the music?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Mum...
{\an8}<font color=lightblue>Mum, can you hear the songs?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Run away, you devil!
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Here Jackie, come, come..
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Sit there. Are you cold?
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Come on then.
{\An8}<font color=lightblue>Here, kitty, kitty.
{\An8} <font color=lightblue>Come here, kitty, come.
