In the mining town of Gold Lick
the year was 1870.
The Chinese came to work and
rid themselves of poverty.
Then one night it happened,
the disaster struck.
A rumble from below,
the Chinese were stuck.
An old Chinaman prayed
all the loved ones he's so cherished.
Asking the Saint of curd to
protect to souls who perished.
Guan-Di is his name.
Guan-Di is his name.
Guan-You, Guan-Me, Guan-Di.
Guan-Di is his name.

Morticia's all yours. I'm gonna go practice my
Human Fly on little miss Skyscraper over there.
Don't it look ancient?
Historic?
Yeah, these graves have been
around since the cave in of...
- A long time ago.
- It must've meant a lots of these people.
Let's break something!
As long it's not my heart.
- What do you say? Give some sugar, baby!
- What?
We can play the hard
to get all night, but...
This game's called eye tag, -
then let's say I'm in.
You're a loss, baby!
You're a loss.
So, uh...
- Why haven't I seen you in around the school?
- That's because I'm never there.
Cool.
- Seeing anybody?
- No.
Cool!
Groovy!
Christ! Shit!
Come on!
Get the hell out of here!
Freak.
Shit! Clayton, run!
Yeah. Try, Romeo.
Shit!

- That's heat lightning, baby.
What the fuck? Get off me!
- Jeff! Don't leave me!
- Come on, Clayton! Run!
- Jeff, don't leave me, man!
- Come on, man!
Don't fucking leave me!
No!
Shit!
What did I do?
Hold it right there!
What's wrong with you, Striker?
You've got the cave alien cornered.
Ok, so transmit the scans
up to Delta-Baker, -
plant some bio-blasters
and send out for Chinese.
- Colonel Parker is still trapped down there.
- Cry me a river, toots.
Last time I ran into colonel Parker,
he had me in front of a firing squad!
Coward! I should've left you
on the Regular 9.
You know you couldn't do that baby.
That's right. You knew they'd build
me out your old man's DNA. Don't you?
So I say we're keeping the family
search swapping some spit ASAP.
- You're disgusting!
- I'm a man, -
and I've wanted to do this ever
since we landed on this rock.
Damn it! We're surrounded!
Got you! Get down!
Can't you die?
- Cut! Cut!
- Cut!
- Dude, light me, don't fight me.
- Hey, bite me!
- Bruce, that was sweet.
- Don't you think it was little over the top?
No, it was very Caligula
meets the Apple Dumpling Gang.
- That's not an answer.
- It was perfect for Cave Alien 2. Moving on!
Hey, Tiny. Fetch me another
lemon water, will you?
- They'd just run out, man.
- Well then do... you run out. Capisce?
Nice shot, baby.
I'll tell you, -
- what a relief on these down and dirty shows to
be working with a pro. - I've wouldn't know.
Goddamn it. Give me some lemon
water. Give me some sugar, baby.
Perfect!
You don't want this, butch...
I know this bar out of Kawaga
where the drinks are cheap and...
I'll be there.
Hello?
- No, you're not interrupting anything.
- At least, think it over!
- there's a cap that refreshing lemon water
that you asked for, sir. - Thanks.
- This is warm!
- Sir, I'm sorry. I'll make sure -
you'll get a ice cold case of it
in your trailer by the morning.
You're lucky. See to it!
Man! That's good!
You're on!
Hey guys. How you're doing?
Here you go. One for you...
When you were in Army of Darkness
and were stuck down in the pit, -
- how did you get your shotgun back?
- Talk to the writer, man, I don't know.
- Did your work with Allen turn you gay?
- No, but your stupid question did.
- Why did you do Serving Sara?
- Why did I do it?
For the money, mouth breather,
why else?
Love of God, what is that stench?
Here, it's called deodorant.
Look it up on your internets.
See ya boys. Late, bonsoir.
- Hey, mister Campbell!
- Yeah?
Gimme your autograph.
- You've got a pen?
- Why? You ain't got no pen?
- What's your name?
- Gerad.
- Here you go, Jerad. Have a good
one, buddy. - It's Gerad with a G.
- Here you go, Gerard.
- Hey, Mr Campbell, you've got a -
more recent picture than this?
- Let me ask you something.
Ever seen Rawhide? - Yeah.
- You like it?
- Yeah.
Well then you know you've got
to keep them doggies rolling!
Freak!
Yo, babycakes! How about a
Bourbon with a...
How about you wait your turn, jerk?
There's more where that came from.
You. You, give me some sugar, baby.
- How you're doing?
- Good, good!
Hey, good news.
I made the trades today.
- Really? - Check the obituaries,
you'll find my career there.
You know Bruce, I just
talked to the studio.
They saw the dailies for
Cave Alien 2, and they said -
- you have never been better.
- That's because unlike most action stars, -
I can speak, what's the word...
"English".
- Will that be in cash?
- Oh yeah, that will be in cash.
My friend and agent, Mr. Mills
Toddner here will take care of that.
That's perfect, you keep the
change. Don't be a stranger.
- Sure, it's a special occasion.
- Sure it is.
It's a night I'll fire your
polyester ass.
- I'm sensing a little hostility
coming this way. - You think so?
Maybe that's because I spent
last six days of my life -
making a sequel to one of the
crappiest movies ever.
- You make lots of crappy movies.
- Oh, that doesn't help.
Liquor, liquor, please!
Look, the customer reviews
on Amazon were great.
Yeah, the ones you posted!
BC, I sense that you wanna unload.
I sense that -
you have a lot on your mind.
So, -
I'm here. Give it to me.
- It's just that I think that...
- Excuse me, I gotta take this.
Jean Paul, bonjour!
I'm sorry.
It just that I think
I'm losing my muse.
Do you know what I mean?
It child-like innocent quality, -
that all great artists have to create.
If an actors life is like a painting,
then it's a work in progress.
But how can I create
my great masterpiece, -
if my paint is drying up,
my canvas is cracked -
and all my brushes are covered
with a fake monster blood!
- It's Cheryl, isn't it?
- No.
- You can't stop thinking about her.
- If I say "no" three times, -
will The Candyman come out?
You were fired before, now you're fired twice.
Okay, you'll never know
what I got you for your birthday.
My birthday?
- You actually remembered my birthday?
- Compadre, hello!
Loco? I am your agent.
You are my number one client.
- If this another Matthew Perry movie...
- Better.
- Gimme a hint. - But you fired me, so...
- Goddamn it! Just tell me!
Let's just say: this is gonna be the
best birthday present you've ever had.
- Nice. - You're crazy.
- No, you are! I love you man!
- How about it!
- Excuse me. I got to take this. Sorry.
Crisp bean curd's
kinda watery and gross.
- But you did get the wadding
cold, didn't you? - Yeah.
- Finnish your bean curd.
- It's still gross.
- What was that, mom?
- I'm not sure, Skippy. You stay here.
BEAN CURD
IT'S GUAN-DI-LICIOUS!
I don't know why I'm complaining.
I'm a lucky guy!
I got my health.
Jesus!
My divorce is final.
Lousy whore!
And I got my loyal fans.
I hated my last movie.
I hated my last five movies, yeah!
Me and my wonderful, wonderful fans.
That was easy.
Hey buddy.
Hey little Sam 'n Rob.
Come here boy!
Come on!
What's the matter?
You thought I forgot
about you, didn't you?
Time for some hooch!
Come on!
Hooch for the pooch!
Here you go.
Some for Dad!
What's on the poop tube?
And now part nine of an ongoing,
exclusive, investigative series.
- Oh, who wants to watch that horse shit!
- Next, we take a scary look -
at the life and times of B movie
horror star Bruce Campbell.
Hey, I know that guy!
Yeah, that's entertainment.
I'll drink for that!
Campbell, best knows for his parts
in a horrific Evil Dead films, -
appears to have disappeared
from the entertainment scene.
- What? - Tonight our Where Are
They Now reporter Charlie Payton -
takes an affectionate look back
on a promising career -
that many feel was squandered
on low budget trash.
You shut your face!
They're treating me like...
Like I'm a has-been!
Like I'm... like I'm all washed out!
They're trying to make me look
pathetic! Yeah, they are!
Not me.
Not me!
Oh God!
- Hallo?
- Hello, Cheryl! It's me.
- Bruce, what now?
- I was just, you know...
celebrating the almost wrap
of my latest movie, you know.
Just one more day.
You got into the dog's
bowl again, didn't you?
Shut up, you selfish blot!
It's your birthday, isn't it?
Every year it's the -
same old Poor Me routine.
Come on. Can't a guy get bombed and call
his ex-wife at 3 'o clock in the morning -
- without it meaning something?
- Bruce.
- I talked to Mills today.
- Yeah? What did Old 10 % have to say?
Just that you were depressed.
- So he's planning something special
for your birthday. - Yeah?
- Did- did he say what?
- Oh no, it's a surprise.
Come on, Shewyl! Tell me!
Tell me, please, Shewyl!
- I'm hanging up!
- No! No! Don't, baby!
I'm sorry. How did things
get so messed up between us?
- You slept with a dog sitter, Bruce!
- One lousy mistake.
- All of them.
- Okay, 12 lousy mistakes.
Come on baby! I was
confused then. I'm fine now!
God, I miss you and the kids.
- What kids? - The ones we would've
had, if you've just hung on!
You wanna know the
truth about us, Bruce?
It wasn't the cheating,
or the boozing, -
or ever the endless whining,
that killed our marriage.
You just couldn't commit.
To your career, -
to our relationship,
to much of anything.
So, the cheating, boozing and
endless whining were ok?
- Who was that, baby?
- Nobody.
Come on Millsy. Introduce
me to Big Jim one more time.
I already set up a meeting.
I'm gonna make a call!
What could you possibly want
at 4:30 in the morning?
- Mr Campbell, we need your help!
- I need my sleep!
Gold Lick needs you!
A group of teenagers unwittingly
unleashed Guan-Di, -
the Chinese God of war and
protector of the dead!
And unless you help us stop him,
he will kill every one of us!
Okay, settle down.
I'm gonna give you some advice.
Keep it under 1,5 million.
Get one name actor, -
and if you go straight to DVD, -
you might break even.
Now, fuck off!
I've heard some lame pitches in
my day, but that takes the cake.
I said get lost, you little...
A quarter!
The Chinese believed there
is a God of every thing.
A good of the sun, the moon,
the wind and rain.
It's hard to imagine,
and it may sound absurd, -
but there's even a
patron saint of bean curd.
Guan-Di is his name.
Guan-Di is his name.
Guan-You, Guan-Me, Guan-Di.
Guan-Di is his name.
What the hell?
- Hey, let me outta here!
- Mr. Campbell?
- Are you ok?
- Who are you?
This is Jeff! Look, umm...
I'm sorry about the
whole baseball bat thing.
Look, I left some Twinkies back there.
And there's a flashlight
next to a spare.
I also left an empty bottle back
there, if you need to... You know.
Look, Mr. Campbell...
I know you're propably tired -
and sore and suffering
from a concussion, -
but is it true, that you're
making a sequel to Cave Alien?
Oh my God! He's a fan.
This finally happened.
Help! Help!
Oh, for God sakes, kid.
At least go easy on the bumps!
I'm sorry Mr. Campbell.
I do my best.
CAUTION ROUGH ROAD
NEXT 75 MILES
- Gin!
- Dang, Ed.
That's three in a row, Edna!
- What was that, Hank?
- I don't know.
Sounded like something up by the barn.
You close that door. You lock it.
- What if you need to come...
- Just close the door, -
don't open it,
no matter what you hear!
Open the door!
Open the door, Edna!
But Hank, you said,
don't open the door!
For Christ sake, woman! We've been married
for 35 years! Open the goddamn door!
Gotcha! There were nothing out there.
I was just funning with you.
You old fool. I can't believe
you got me like that!
You should've seen
the look on your face!
You sure...
Hey Luigi, paint the sign.
I tell you something,
you paint the damn sign!
But I do.
I paint the beauty sign.
There he is!
He is here!
Welcome to Gold Lick, Mr. Campbell.
- Gold Lick? Where the fuck is Gold Lick?
- Hey, easy man, that's the mayor.
I don't give a shit if he's
the king of Kiss My Ass.
I just spent the last six hours in a trunk
and I want some answers. Chop, chop!
Well, hello!
Consider yourself officially
except for my wrath, sweetcakes.
And if you're lucky little later,
I let you play with my boomstick.
What?
Now, I don't imagine, you get
"moving pictures" here in this fart hole, -
so let me explain something.
What you just did... You just
kidnapped a movie star, you got that?
So you didn't just committed
a crime against me, -
which was pretty frigging huge, -
you committed a crime
against art itself!
In fact, I was due back on set of
my latest motion picture hours ago -
and you can bet your bottom dollar, -
they're gonna be doing everything
they can to get me back!
What are we waiting for?
A hole Campbell didn't show up.
Time to plan B, my friend.
Okay people. Big energy, let's go!
Action!
That's good!
As much as I'd love to hang
around here, until the FBI -
- rips to you grit eaters a new one...
- Mr. Campbell, I don't understand!
Your agent said you were free.
What does my agent have
to do with any of this?
He just said, not to book you on
your birthday, or something like that.
My birthday?
My birthday!
My birthday, that's it!
Mills, you magnificent bastard. When
you said there was a surprise in store...
Holy moly! That's a
great tie, by the way.
I gotta make a phone call.
I'll be right back.
Don't do anything
quaint until I return.
- Mills Toddner's office.
- Yes, Mills Toddner, please.
- Who's calling?
- Bruce Campbell. - Who?
- Bruce Campbell.
- He's not here. Is voice mail ok?
- Yeah, voice mail is fine.
- Mills, thrill me!
Mills, Campbell here.
I gotta tell you, pal...
This is without a doubt the most
outrageous birthday present I've ever got.
So, thanks man, you're beautiful.
And that whole firing thing,
what are you crazy, it's a joke!
I know you guys propably can't break
character, but I gotta tell you...
Man, you really had me going.
You really did.
I don't understand.
For a minute there I though I was
in a sequel of The Deliverance, -
and someone was about to say:
"Squeal like a pig, boy!"
Yes, there is no reason
beating around the bush.
- And I realize this is rather unorthodox...
- Say no more, Mr. Mayor.
My hero senses are tingling.
I sense that the town of
Gold Lick is in trouble.
Big trouble. And you need my help.
- Do you? You need my help? Yes or no?
- That's exactly right!
How about that? Put the
words right into your mouth.
But not just any help, huh?
You need someone special.
Someone who can take on
a heinous monster -
and stop him in his tracks
and take him to justice.
That will be me.
Mr. Mayor, your worries are over.
'Cause there's a new sheriff in town,
and his gonna clean up this mess.
Gold Lick, it's a good day.
I'm here to help!
Let's hear it for mister Bruce Campbell!
It's just another day
in the life of a hero.
Mr. Mayor, tell us what's next.
We'd like to show you exactly
what you're up against.
GOLD LICK CITY HALL
Leather, red, leather.
Yellow, leather, red, yellow.
Red, leather, yellow, leather...
- My foot!
- Pardon me there...
Excuse me, Cooper.
Boy, this is exciting, huh? You think
they're gonna give the key to the city?
- I doubt it.
- How about the key to your place?
I'm sorry, we haven't met.
I'm Kelly Graham.
Graham, voilà! Bet all the
boys go cracker over you!
That was funny.
When I was six.
Well, I was six once. Hey, we
already have something in common.
Oh, heck, I'm...
I'm Bruce.
- Bruce Campbell.
- Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Jeff's been bragging
about you for years.
- Uber fan's connected to you, huh?
- I'm afraid so.
Younger brother?
- Son.
- Young mother!
- It's a country life.
- Oh, hey a milf is a milf.
But I don't see a wedding ring.
Are you married or happy, Kelly Graham?
I'm not sure I'm
comfortable answering that.
- Mr. Campbell, if you're ready?
- Yeah, knock yourself out, chief!
- Show time, huh?
- Mr. Trepping, let's start the slide show.
As we all know, Gold Lick
is a mining community.
In the late 1850's hundreds
of Chinese immigrants -
came to our shores to
help work the claims.
At her height, the Triple T mine employed
hundreds of Chinese immigrant laborers.
They worked long hours
in primitive conditions, -
surviving on rise and bean curd.
Then disaster strike.
You want disaster? Anyone here
seen a Sultan Dome 4?
- Don't answer that.
- A mine shaft cave in.
Over a 100 Chinese were buried alive, -
and remain there today.
Gold Lick has never been
the same since.
That guy's pretty good.
Did he come from dinner theatre?
No, Iowa.
They go all the trouble
to kidnap somebody, -
I'd kidnap that Jake
character for Evil Dead 2.
My money bet on that blacksmith
from Army of Darkness.
- Now, that one stud!
- You're damn straight.
I wish I could quit you.
Soon after rumors begin
to spread over curse.
Okay! When did my
ex-wife start modelling?
- No, that's it. That's the thing.
- Legend has it, -
that the Chinese demon
was summoned -
to protect the spirits of
all those who had died.
A warning. He who
would confront Guan-Di, -
would also confront death itself.
- Well, hello Mr. Plot Point.
- His name is Wing.
He's one of the last surviving
descendents of the dead laborers.
Guan-Di has been unleashed
from his grave.
I'm sorry, was that "unreached"?
Unleashed! Unleashed! What's the
matter? Don't you speak English?
Guan-Di great warrior.
Guan-Di protector of dead, -
savior of the innocent and -
the bean curd.
Bean curd?
Bean curd a popular Chinese dish.
You -
You chatter like monkey.
I call you Chattering Monkey!
His grave has been disturbed.
And Guan-Di will not stop until every
last relative of the one who did this -
are rotting in the earth.
What could be so bad about that?
Okay, blood relatives,
raise your hands.
Guan-Di knows that you and
I are not related, right?
I shall do an ancient Chinese
dance which will free you all -
of the curse of Guan-Di.
Has it been dispelled? No?
Okay, you're all going to die.
But know this: Guan-Di goes
stronger with every person he kills.
Until all of you will die!
Will die!
He's gone!
No, actually he's- he's right...
Well folks it-it-it- it looks
like the presentation is over.
Just be careful on you way home.
And- and look out for your neighbors.
Well, that was exciting.
As you can see, Mr. Campbell, the
future of Gold Lick rest in your hands.
We sure appreciate your being here.
We're thinking, you might wanna freshen up -
- and get a bite to eat before you lead
us in the battle. - That's a good idea.
because I always freshen up before
I go in the battle and kill monsters.
- You don't wanna leave a bad impression.
- Lordy, you're good people.
- You're welcome to wash up at my tavern.
- That's good because -
- as you can see, I'm a dirty little boy.
- I got a nice little place upstairs.
You can wait there until dinner.
No one will hassle you, or anything.
If you insist, Jeff.
I'd say the only thing
missing is a stool sample.
- I guess I'm kind of a fan.
- Yeah, do you think?
- That's not familiar.
- Hey, that's personal!
Look, Mr. Campbell. I fixed
you up a room back here.
I gave you some fresh
towels and clothes and...
Look, I know this is a big
imposition for you, so...
What ever I can do to make you feel
at home, just let me know, okay?
First of all, kid...
Mr. Campbell makes soup.
My name is Bruce. Secondly,
you wanna get on my good side, -
you'll dig up a bar of soap
and a bottle of Jack.
And not in that order.
Nothing like a shower
to wash the blues away.
Jeff, where in the heck did you
find this Evil Dead shampoo?
Bruce, that's drain cleaner.
Maybe that would explain
the burning sensation...
What?
It's just that you're going up against
Guan-Di, and you're not even scared.
You don't know fear, kid.
You've never worked with Sam Raimi.
Compared to most Hellspawn
this Guan-Di cat's no biggie.
Really?
You know, in the hero business, you
only have to remember two things.
One: most monsters are
just a guy in a rubber suit.
Two: you can't fight a guy in a
rubber suit on an empty stomach.
So this particular hero needs
some food and some drink.
Mr. Campbell!
- Pick your poison, Mr. Campbell.
- Oh, I hardly ever touch the stuff.
- It's on the house.
- In that case I take a Slow Screw -
- against the wall, and make it a double.
- Maybe this is all a big joke to you, -
but Jeff has talked whole town to thinking
you're gonna save us from Quan-Di.
- Yeah, and? - As far as I can tell,
you're pretty much full of shit.
Sounds to me like you're
wondering from the script, sister.
Didn't you read the fine print:
"Never piss of the hero."
- Kelly's been known to speak her mind.
- Sounds to me like she needs to be recast.
- She ad lib's to much.
- Walk with me, Mr. Campbell.
If I wanted to take shit from
a bunch of bogus actors, -
- I'd go back to LA. Get that out of my face!
- Sure, I understand, Mr. Campbell.
But, you see, Kelly's
been through a rough patch.
Her whining, cheating, boozing
husband left her and Jeff in a lurch, -
and she just hasn't been herself lately.
Go ahead, and have a seat!
We're gonna treat you so many
ways, you bound to like one.
- We appreciate you being here.
- You could've spell my name right.
Hey, Kelly. Like it or not,
that man is our salvation.
Good gravy, you got to play ball!
He's talking like he's crazy,
like none of this is real!
Great war heroes are often on a
different plane than you and I.
Service, please!
Eccentricity is often
the brother to greatness.
And obnoxiousness is often
the brother of a black eye!
I admit, he's a bit of an odd dog.
But hopefully he'll be gone lickety-split -
- and we can get back to our normal life.
- I just hope you're right.
Could it possibly get worse?
May I have another sandwich parilla?
Ding-ding, game's all up, buddy!
For crying out loud...
Hey, sometime today, Big Ray!
Hey, you old ball sack, I've been
honkin' for ya! I want some gas!
Oh, I got you! You're still upset
about your little sister Wanda.
Well, truth is, it was late, -
she was lonely and I
was using a wrong head!
Head! Head! Head!
Can't a guy get something
to eat around here?
Time for some dancing.
How rude!
Ma'am, may I have this dance?
- Do you believe in reincarnation?
- Why?
'Cause it's not gonna
happen in this life time!
Well, there's a cold wind
blowing in Cold Lick tonight...
What's the matter? Can't you
take a joke, mister Actor Boy?
I'd love to dance with you.
- Do you really mean that?
- Like my life depended on it.
I gotta warn you, I'm
not a very good dancer.
Oh, I bet you all country
girls say the same thing.
Come on, show me some stuff.
Sorry, sorry...
You weren't kidding.
You really suck.
- Let's see how the city boy fares.
- All right.
Around we go!
Watch this...
You allright, honey?
I've heard of break dancing,
but this is ridiculous.
- I hope, you're better actor than
you're a dancer. - Obviously, -
- I have no idea what I'm doing.
- Maybe we should try something... together.
You better lead.
Okay! Now we're getting somewhere!
Hey, everybody!
We're dancing!
Hey lady, ten cents a ride,
no exceptions.
- Hey, what was that?
- Nothing. - Oh, no.
Corners of your mouth
turned up at the edges.
There's old an Indian
saying for that phenomenon.
"Kahu-ta-ei-smiley".
That's Cherokee for:
"She who smiles at one, she no
longer continues to hate."
Shut up and dance!
Well, I don't know about you,
but I could use some fresh air.
- Me too. And just fresh air.
- Of course.
Even after everything that's
happened... God I love this place.
I grew up in a town just like it.
Little Place in Michigan.
- Ever heard of it?
- Michigan?
- No, Little Place. It's just north of Flint.
- Sounds nice.
- Made my first movie there when
I was still in High School. - Really?
Oh, we were young and naive,
and we wanted to make a movie -
that represented our
hopes and dreams...
- What was that called?
- Blade of The Skull Ripper.
- That's when I got the acting bug.
- You've come a long way since then.
You haven't seen much of
my recent stuff, I guess.
Believe it or not, Jeff
has shown me a couple.
I don't know about the plots, but...
- You're usually pretty good in them.
- You really mean that?
I wouldn't say, if I didn't.
You're just full of surprises,
ain't you, Kelly Graham?
Well, here's one for you.
I actually think...
I'm a little shy.
- That's why I come on so strong.
- I came on kinda strong myself.
- It's not easy for me to...
- Yes?
Express my... true feelings.
You wanna move that hand?
- Yeah. Sorry about that.
- Well, I'll let it slide.
This time.
Mr. Campbell?
- Sure, Mr. Mayor. Just give
me five minutes. - It's time.
For the love of God,
I can smell her ChapStick!
I'm so gonna take a rain check.
All right, come on!
All right, small town America.
Show me what you've got.
No matter which way you
wanna go, Mr. Campbell, -
- I think we've got you covered.
- All right.
You might wanna slip this little
Beretta. 22 into your pocket?
It's for that close range,
last minute desperation stuff.
- What's your name?
- Frank.
Frank, nice gun. For a girl.
- You wanna step it up a bit, do ya?
- Hello!
There's a. 45. Long slide,
widow maker.
- I think it'd be just right for ya.
- Close, Frank, but no cigar.
- World of secrecy you want?
- Duh!
There's Marlin 336.
Shoot a pigs eye off
from a 1 000 yards.
And who wouldn't wanna do that?
- Frank, you're holding out on me.
Come on. - Well, then again...
- If you're taking out the Chinese
God of war... - And we are.
Wrap you hands around this Parker
12 gauge double barrel beauty.
That's for people that don't call 911.
I think we get the idea, Frank,
and thanks for that, -
but I'd be willing to wager that Mr.
Campbell is more than capable of -
telling us which weapon should
be used under the circumstances.
- Of course. I'm sorry, Mr. Campbell.
- That's okay.
Go ahead Mr. Campbell.
Tell us exactly what we need.
Don't you think Frank really... said
it all with the guns and everything...
Of course for personal protection,
you may have never heard of this gun...
I always use a...
It's permanent press.
But I can see that you -
obviously don't have
that gun here, so...
I just have to
limp along with this...
- .31 long bow. - .45 long slide.
- Long slide, like I said, so...
Come on Gold Lick,
get your guns!
Gimme a big one!
- One at the time!
- Bruce, can I show you something?
We've got you covered.
All right!
My goodness, Jake...
Now we can slide off to San Francisco.
And I'm riding shotgun.
I thought you might wanna use this.
I had it made special.
Bricks 'n stridin'. Two stroke.
The half inch claw.
- What do you think?
- Wow!
It's really something.
You know Jeff...
I've gotten lot of use out
of chainsaws over the years.
Killed a lot of zombies.
Saved a lot of lifes.
But at the end of the day,
when push comes to shove, -
they're just too damn heavy!
So...
Thanks just the same, kid.
See you out there.
Yeah...
Don't be late!
All right! You guys
ready for some violence?
- Yeah!
- That's right!
- Sure you're ready for this, Bruce?
- Kid, I've made a movie in Bulgaria.
I'm ready for anything.
Put yourself on ice, sugar lips.
'Cause when I come back -
I'm gonna lay claim to the prettiest
pair of green eyes I've ever seen!
- Let's do it!
- Be careful!
And my eyes are brown!
Dumbshit!
All right folks, listen up.
It could get ugly out there tonight.
Real ugly.
So if something happens and you
don't think you're gonna make it, -
just remember this: Even though you
don't have a medical insurance, -
emergency rooms are mandated by a federal
law to treat critically injured patients, so...
Techically, you got
nothing to worry about.
Beside from that:
Bruce Campbell's got your back.
Now, come on Gold Lick.
Let's kick some Guan-Di butt!
Yeah, this is Henderson
crossing old state road.
No sign of the demon, over.
- Oh, my God, Henderson!
He's right behind you! - Where?
- Oh, Jesus!
- Just kidding, chief.
That ain't funny!
Jeff, after this is over,
I gotta meet your sound guy.
- We don't have a sound guy.
- We're gonna try to smoke him out!
- He's got a sword, over!
- Stay to courage, Chicken Little.
- He's a big sucker! - What'd you
expect? He's Chinese God of war.
Oh, no! He spotted me!
He's coming before me!
No. No!
Give it a rest, Shatner.
Bruce? Let's do something?
- What the fuck is that?
- It's Guan-Di!
- You mean the son of a bitch is real?
- Shouldn't we shoot it?
No!
Retreat!
- Bruce, where are you going?
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
Daddy?
Daddy?
- My ear!
- Stop shooting! Stop shooting!
Keys! Keys! Come on
it's the country!
Don't you keep your
fucking keys in your trucks?
Coil where... to the ignition.
What could possibly go wrong?
Man! That always worked
in the movies.
Gimme that!
Thank you!
Give me back my bike,
you old prick!
And McHale's Navy sucked!
Young man, are you all right?
Lady, you've gotta give a
ride out of here, right now!
I'm sorry, but there's no room.
Oh, yes there is.
Get out of there!
Get out of there!
Get out of here!
Oh, my kitty... my kitty cat!
You horrible man! And you were
the worst thing about Moontrap!
Yeah! "Come to Gold Lick."
"Help us fight a monster."
What the hell were they thinking?
Now this supernatural son of
a bitch is after me! Oh, man...
I've gotta blow this pop stand fast!
I'm so screwed!
Oh, that cheapskate old lady.
Hey, guys!
- I need a car. Pronto!
- Hey, ain't you that -
- demon-fighting-son-of-a-bitch?
- Yeah, I am...
I came back 'cause I needed some
garbage bags and shovels, 'cause we...
We killed- Hold that thought, guys!
Nice talking to you!
Suckers! You won't have
me to kick around any more!
You can take this little crappy
ass town, and shove it right up-
- Bruce! - Yeah?
- Where's Jeff?
- You just left him out there?
- It depends -
what the definition of
"out there" is.
Lady, you never told me that
this monster was real! Shoelace!
There he is!
Stop that truck!
Bastard!
Mom!
Where's Bruce?
Stop that truck!
He's just a damn coward!
Ennore been here five year.
Nobody die.
Now, everybody die.
Nobody else better die. I got a
half of the winter to the wage.
Bullshit.
There's some crazy shit
going down in this town.
What are gonna do with that?
With flashing red eyes
and a flowing white beard -
everyone knew he was
a God to be feared.
Guan-Di is his name.
Guan-Di is his name.
Guan-you, Guan-me, Guan-Di.
Guan-Di is his name.
Cute little Sam 'n Rob.
Least I still have you.
Come here boy!
Come on!
Son of a bitch!
Maybe I feel better after breakfast.
Most important meal of the day.
This is Bruce Campbell,
actor extraordinaire.
If you're young, female and
not currently incarcerated -
page me at *998.
Otherwise, leave a
message after the tune.
- Bruce, it's Cheryl.
- Cheryl?
There's something I've
been meaning to tell you.
Something that's been weighing
on me ever since our divorce.
- Of course I'll forgive you!
- It's the alimony payment.
It's just not cutting it.
So my lawyers filed a
motion to have it increased.
Along with the fresh restraining order.
So, don't even try to -
returning this call,
you fuckhead!
Oh, you heartless Hellspawn.
Get the fuck out of here!
Sleep with the scorpions, bitch!
Who does she think she is?
Thinks I'm some low budget,
two-bit actor.
I'll tell you what...
"From the desk of Mills Toddner.
Pack your bags, baby.
Back to back in Bulgaria."
Cave Alien 3.
And 4.
Oh, no.
No! No!
Hang on a second!
What the hell do you want?
I'm busy.
Hey, I'm Kasey, the famous
singing prostitute.
I'm here to offer birthday greetings
and wish you lots of luck.
And if you're really, really lucky,
I even toss in a free-
Who sent you?
"Your fan and agent, Mills Toddner.
Here's some birthday sugar, baby."
That's it? That was my
special gift? A woman?
Actually, I'm only half way through my
transgender surgery, so technically...
For the love of God!
Just stop.
- Campbell residence.
- Bruce, it's Jeff.
You little bastard. You're the one
who dragged me into this nightmare.
Now, what are you calling to chew
my ass out for taking the powder?
No, I...
- I just wanted to thank you.
- Thank me? For what?
For teaching me the
meaning of courage.
- I ran like cheap mascara.
- That's just it!
When I was trying to dodge my
responsibilities by dumping them on you, -
you showed my I have to
face this thing on my own.
Yeah!
Glad you learned the error
of your ways, kid.
I'm the one who unleashed Guan-Di.
It's up to me to kill him.
You're gonna take on to
sure that fuckhead solo?
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.
All I needed was a push.
No, no, no! Kid, kid!
- Son of a...
- Boyfriend troubles?
No.
Stupid kid's gonna get himself killed!
What do I care?
I got problems of my own!
- Who are you?
- I'm your good nature, Bruce.
Now you heed my warning. If Jeff goes
up against Guan-Di all by himself...
Oh, he'll be cut to ribbons.
You've got to help a dear boy.
Don't listen to him.
He's an asshole!
- Fuck 'em! Nobody lives forever!
- How can say such a thing?
- You awful Demon!
- I got some for you right here, Angel!
Bruce, you've got to help Jeff.
He's your biggest fan!
Get off over me, freaks!
You, nurse Ratched.
- How would you like to make a 100 bucks?
- Story of my life.
- No, no, I need a ride.
- That's why I'm here.
In your car.
- Kinky! - No, I need a ride
to a town called Gold Lick.
I need to kill me a Guan-Di.
- Keep away from him honey!
- All right, stay here.
Try not to blow anybody
till I get back.
Hey, Kelly.
Why don't you go home? Go find
yourself some fake Hollywood girl, -
'cause you and me
were never real.
Kelly, please...
I'm not one of those shallow sex machines
like all those other Hollywood types.
Hey, mister you still
owe me a hundred bucks!
And we still have to have sex!
Would you excuse me
for just a second?
For the love of God!
Just take the money and go.
I'll take a rain check on
exsay a little atterlay.
What ever dude.
Kelly, look.
We don't have much time...
- Hey, that's all my stuff!
- Well, -
Jeff asked me to purge his loft.
- It was my pleasure.
- Oh, sweet Jesus!
That's a limited edition!
Anymore where that came from.
Are you still here? Don't you
have a bad movie to make?
Listen, I know I let you down.
And I'm sorry. But the callow movie
star who came into your life yesterday -
is not the same man who's
standing here today.
It took the faith of a teenager and the
decency of a good woman to open my eyes.
Believe me, in the last 24
hours I've learn a lot about -
decency, respect.
Even...
Love.
A man isn't much of anything unless
he can learn from his mistakes -
and make 'em right, so...
Look, I'm to say I'm sorry.
But more importantly,
I wanna make it right.
So, I'm not asking you
for second change, Kelly.
I'm beggin' here. Maybe it
doesn't make much sense, -
because we don't
know each other, but...
I think I...
- I think I...
- Move the hand.
Sure.
Well, even if we're over,
at least help me rescue Jeff.
- What, Jeff needs to be rescued?
- He's gone after Guan-Di.
- I thought you knew.
- Oh, my God!
Wait!
Okay...
Maybe this was a bad idea.
Okay, this is definitely a bad idea.
Big ass, self-obsessed movie star!
- Haven't you ever heard of a telephone?
- Look, I'm not self-obsessed.
You really think I have a big ass?
Do you even know where we're going?
Jeff's friends were killed outside
that old Chinese graveyard.
I'm guessing that's where they went.
- Move the hand!
- Okay, okay! My God...
Jeff! Jeff?
He's not in there!
If he has any sense, he's propably
hightailing back to town.
If he'd had any sense
he'd wouldn't called you.
Stand back, Kell. Mr. Winchester
is itching for some action.
What? Where am I...
Hey, you big son of a bitch!
Pick on somebody your own size!
Jeff, come on!
- Are you okay, baby?
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm okay in a
scared to death kinda way.
Okay, here's the deal. I'm gonna
stall the one turn one time -
which should give you maybe -
30 seconds to find a way
to stop him, before he -
rips my head off and
shoves in face, so...
- Better get busy.
- Bruce.
- Yes, Kelly?
- Before you go...
You'll need ammo.
I knew that.
Okay, Jeff, you know this
stuff way better than I do.
- How do we stop it?
- Okay...
Hollywood writers have
spent countless hours -
writing stories about
defeating monsters.
There's gotta be something
we can use in here.
Hey, stay where I can see you!
Okay Doofus, here I am!
How we're doing team?
Bruce, I think this might work.
Where's the nearest oceanic
oil drilling platform?
About 1 000 miles away.
- Do we have any abandoned steel mills
of giant vats of molten metal? - Come on!
How about extensive mine shafts
systems of cannibal bats -
- underneath the active volcanoes?
- You've gotta be shitting me.
PROTECTED FOR THOSE WHO DIED
BEWARE THOSE WITHOUT BEAN CURD
Died...
Release.
You can't bowl for shit!
You should go back to dig.
- Hello.
- Hello.
You here for me?
No, this! My mess. Thank you.
You trick me!
An island full of
giant mutated gorillas?
Wait, no. You died now.
Hollywood writers spend all day
in dark rooms by themselves.
They have no concept of
reality whatsoever, so...
You'd better think of something
else, and pretty damn fast!
Bruce!
The sign. He's also the
protector of bean curd.
I'll be a horse's ass!
Pardon me, big guy.
Nice to know that tofu really
is good for your health.
- Here he is.
- Hey lady!
Forget you? Give me back
my bean curd!
Afraid of Wing?
Wing powerful. More
powerful than Guan-Di, -
who is Wing's servant and must
listen to anything Wing say.
Right Guan-Di?
Bean curd?
- Hey, that gives me an idea.
- Yeah, what?
Look, I know I'm throwing
a real Hail Mary here.
But do you got any
dynamite in this truck?
Of course I don't have any
dynamite. What kind of freak...
- I do.
- What?
Bruce, I got dynamite,
wire and a plunger.
What, I was going up against Guan-Di,
mom. I brought all kinds of shit.
- I mean "stuff".
- Good, you get the dynamite.
- Meet me at the entrance of the mine shaft.
- You're gonna use yourself as bait?
Well, yes and no. We're gonna get
a little help from my friend here.
When Guan-Di spots my ass on his doorstep,
he's gonna go totally Pearl Harbor.
That's when we drop the
mountain on his demon ass.
- Sounds little risky.
- You're telling me? This is our only standee.
When hairy carry Larry takes a dirt nap,
we take this sacred amulet -
you know, the entire
reason why we're here -
we put it right back where it belongs.
That way we can all get back to -
our normal, miserable lifes.
Well, this is it. I'll keep him away
from entrance until you give the signal.
Now, look...
No matter which way this goes,
I want you both to know one thing.
I'll never forgive you
for dragging me out here.
Okay, it's just you and me,
Top Ramen.
You're the protector
of bean curd. Get busy!
Nice catch!
Half grounder!
That's gonna mean some extra runts.
Another one!
- Oh, bad hap.
- Almost ready!
- Let's go, mom.
- We're ready!
Just walking along...
Minding my own business...
Look, a mine shaft!
Hey asshole!
Go fuck yourself!
Wait, wait. Let him get
all the way in.
- He's not buying it.
- That's weird. I approved that likeness.
Bruce, what do we do? - Looks like we're
gonna have to do this the old fashion way.
- Mano a monster.
- But that's suicide!
Only if I die, kid.
Wish me luck.
- Bruce?
- Yes?
For luck.
- You wanna move that hand?
- That's not my hand.
- Okay Jeff, do it! Now!
- Mom, I can't!
Not the face! Not the face!
- It is Bruce Campbell!
- I know how much he means to you.
How much he means to all the
audiences across the world.
How much he means
to me... But look, -
you gotta just think of
one question right now:
What would Bruce Campbell do?
- Run away?
- No!
I can't believe he's gone.
Stay there.
Bruce!
Well... I'm glad that's over.
- Jeff, I'd just have one request.
- Anything, Bruce.
Next time you unleash an ancient
demon... Call that Buffy chick.
Stop, stop!
What's the problem, Bruce?
Look, I'm sorry. But these
shock endings are rip off.
We just killed the creature like
30 seconds ago, and now it's back?
The fans deserve better.
And come on, for once -
could we please have a
happy ending to a horror film?
- Yeah. A happy ending is a great...
- I'll think about it.
Think about it though.
Oh, I never knew
life could be so swell.
Once you'd made love the Bruce
Campbell way, you never go back.
Father, Mother! I've just been
accepted to Harvard.
I told you that C average
was nothing to worry about.
Group hug!
- Are you happy? Are you happy?
- Oh, yes!
- We're all happy.
- One big happy family!
Wow!
Now I ask you: What could be
a better ending than that?
Oh, my God!
HAIL TO THE KING!
