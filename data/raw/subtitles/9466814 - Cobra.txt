<b>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</b>
It gives us immense pleasure in
introducing the speaker for
tonight.
A billionaire who took
the world of commerce by storm.
Whose stocks skyrocketed
leaving the entire business
fraternity amused.
A true visionary,
and with a golden heart.
A compassionate philanthropist
who stands for humanity...
<b>and cares for the underprivileged.</b>
Who tries making life better
for the entire human race.
<b>He is a demon.</b>
A heartless cold-blooded demon
who doesn't value human life
at all.
Thousands of people have already died
because of Rishi.
<b>He poisoned the very air we breathe.</b>
We are going to suffer
from its effects for several years.
Despite being responsible for thousands of deaths,
Rishi is
going to reopen his factory.
<b>He is a heartless monster.</b>
<b>After several years of protest...</b>
the ex-CM heeded our protests
and shut this factory down.
<b>But he is no more today.</b>
<b>Are you trying to threaten me?</b>
I can put you behind bars for life
if I wanted to.
I'm just being considerate
because you are a little kid.
<b>The ban on your factory stays.</b>
I've sent a letter to the PM's office
recommending your
company be blacklisted.
<b>Forget about Orissa.</b>
You can't set foot in any part of India.
Not even an inch.
<b>Guards!</b>
Mr. Chief Minister...
Mr. Chief Minister...
This is getting me really excited
for the payback.
<b>I'll be back.</b>
<b>Back again.</b>
<b>You loss will be much more severe.</b>
Put your hands together to welcome
the youngest and most
prolific entrepreneur...
who stamped his authority
in over 175 countries.
<b>Rajiv Rishi of Rishi Corporations.</b>
<b>Truth will triumph!</b>
When my father died and left me
in charge of Rishi
Corporations...
<b>I was 17 years old.</b>
People wondered how a young boy like me
would manage such a
big company.
<b>They underestimated me.</b>
"He is just a little boy.
He can't do squat!" They mocked
me.
But I rose against them
even as they tried to put me down.
I've led the company from nowhere
into the Top 5 Companies
in the US.
Nothing feels as good as beating your doubters
in their own
turf and sitting before them like a king.
<b>It's such a lovely feeling.</b>
When you wants to do good for the nation,
hundreds of people
 will try to stop you.
Poor guys.
Let them try to stop you.
<b>Let's do the best we can.</b>
<b>Jai Hind.</b>
<b>Thank you.</b>
<b>O Lord Muruga...</b>
<b>Welcome, sir.</b>
Hey, Mr. Reporter...
How are you doing, journalist
Nellaiyappan?
<b>Yeah...</b>
<b>I'm okay, Nawab Sir.</b>
<b>So...</b>
Looks like your boss
gave an interview.
<b>I saw it on TV.</b>
<b>What does he say?</b>
<b>He is happy.</b>
<b>All thanks to you.</b>
The Orissa CM had challenged
he'd shut down Rishi
Corporations.
<b>Your guy did the job perfectly.</b>
<b>I need to meet him.</b>
<b>Where is he?</b>
<b>He doesn't meet anyone.</b>
<b>He won't work for anyone else either.</b>
<b>It's not easy to get to him.</b>
He doesn't own a cellphone,
or use WhatsApp or e-mail.
<b>He doesn't even have an Aadhaar card.</b>
<b>He says it's for his own safety.</b>
<b>But that's not even the main issue.</b>
If I reveal his identity
and give you his contact
information...
<b>I'd be out of business, won't I?</b>
<b>You talk really well, Nellai.</b>
<b>This isn't like the Orissa CM job.</b>
<b>The whole world will be watching.</b>
If you have even a small element of doubt,
now is the time
to back out.
You said we'd get to the point,
so skip past the unnecessary
 talk!
Just tell me where the money is,
so that I can get started.
I also need to shower here
before I can leave!
<b>Hello? Can you hear me?</b>
<b>Yes, I can.</b>
"Backing out" doesn't exist
in his dictionary.
Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now.
Not even you.
<b>Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now.</b>
<b>Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now.</b>
<b>Go save the prince!</b>
Save the prince,
save the prince...
<b>Save the prince!</b>
<b>Go save the prince!</b>
Save the prince,
save the prince...
<b>Save the prince!</b>
<b>Chief, all Interpol servers have been hacked.</b>
But we haven't been able to
identify the hacker.
<b>We are unable to stop this too.</b>
But trust me chief,
this is something next to impossible.
<b>Officer, absolutely nothing to worry.</b>
<b>The Prince is absolutely safe and sound.</b>
By the way, why should I
trust this information?
<b>I'm not sure.</b>
Our servers got hacked
and we got this information.
<b>But you know no ordinary man can do this.</b>
<b>This must be a mere hoax, officer.</b>
Moreover, today is
The Prince's Royal Wedding.
You know how tight the security system is
for an event like
the royal wedding.
<b>Nobody can save the Prince of Scotland now.</b>
Officer, we have verified every single guest
in the church
through several security checks.
We can see all the details about
any of our guests through
the click of a button.
Their activities since last week,
the places they visited,
the people they met etc.
Today, nobody can even dream of
getting anywhere close to
the prince.
<b>Anyways... thanks, officer.</b>
<b>We will take it from here.</b>
James, play all the channels
that are telecasting the Royal
Wedding.
<b>Ladies and gentlemen and Christ...</b>
let me tell you about the supreme power
that has brought all
 of us here today.
<b>The power that cares.</b>
<b>The power that heals.</b>
<b>The power that fuels the universe.</b>
Today, two beautiful young people are united
by this
powerful phenomenon called love.
<b>There is power in love.</b>
There is power in love to help,
and heal when nothing else
can.
There is power to love and lift up
and liberate when nothing
 else will.
<b>Set this love as a stamp on your heart.</b>
<b>A stamp on your mind.</b>
<b>A stamp on your soul.</b>
<b>Francis, that isn't Augustus.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>This isn't Fr. Augustus Ledox.</b>
<b>Father, that is him.</b>
No!
- People always ask me...
"Father, why do all the
scriptures teach love?"
<b>Oh, shit!</b>
<b>That does look like him.</b>
Love is kind.
It does not envy.
<b>It does not boast.</b>
<b>Someone is in danger there.</b>
It keeps no record of the wrongs.
- Who is that man?
Love is in the music of the birds,
the dance of the trees...
<b>the lull of the ocean.</b>
I heard there is love in every single atom
of the air that
surrounds us.
<b>I can experience that divine love...</b>
in the beautiful faces
of the Prince of Scotland...
<b>and the Princess to be.</b>
Ladies and gentlemen
and Christ...

How did he get the blueprints
of a 16th century church
tunnel?
And how did he precisely time
the fall of the chandelier?
<b>What's the theory behind that?</b>
<b>The bulb contained liquid nitrogen.</b>
It corroded the steel chain
of the chandelier.
<b>The corrosion made the chain weaker.</b>
<b>Take Titanic as an example.</b>
A huge ship which broke
upon collision with an iceberg.
Ship manufacturers stopped using pure steel
only after the
Titanic incident.
<b>Not just that.</b>
He also used cyanide shots which killed
the Prince in a
fraction of a second.
<b>Aslan...</b>
I need to talk to you
about your case.
We've received a lot of mails
from this ID over the last six
 months.
<b>I opened it by chance yesterday.</b>
<b>And I found this document.</b>
This was sent by a Criminology Professor
named Bhavana
Menon.
<b>From Chennai, India.</b>
<b>Chennai?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
This is a thesis report
written by one of her students.
<b>This mentions several similarities between...</b>
the Scotland Prince's assassination case
which you are
handling...
and the assassination of a Chief Minister
in India last
year.
<b>Cobra.</b>
I read the complete report
and it sounds plausible.
General, there are several rumours and theories
floating
around regarding this case.
<b>This must be one of them.</b>
Do you seriously think an undergrad college student
who
doesn't even know all the case details...
could have possibly cracked
a case as big as this?
<b>Yeah.</b>
I guess I should investigate the killing
that happened in
India...
<b>before I reach a conclusion.</b>
I am leaving for Chennai
in the next flight.
It's been a long time
since I've been there.
<b>Who is he looking for?</b>
Does the train come late
just for him?
<b>Bhavana, why are you late?</b>
<b>Little one...</b>
<b>Okay, got it.</b>
Where were you?
- Sister!
<b>Sit down.</b>
<b>You missed it today.</b>
There were a lot of claps
and applause!
<b>Check this trophy out!</b>
Here is something to go
with the trophy!
The 49th wedding invite
of my students.
Display it in your showcase
and celebrate it!
My students are going around
having babies at the age of
19-20.
Yesterday, one of them invited me
to her daughter's 5th
birthday.
<b>But look at me!</b>
Yeah, it must be really hard
on Bhavana.
<b>Look there.</b>
That's one of her students.
She looks so happy with her
granddaughter!
No, you don't get it.
Cute counters like this will work.
<b>You don't need to do shit!</b>
Your friend is way past the age of
sweet talk and cute love.
<b>Stop behaving like 40s kids!</b>
<b>40s kids?</b>
"If everyone in your family
agrees to the wedding..."
<b>Like hell they will.</b>
Do you know how hard it is
to be in love with you?
You don't use a phone,
or WhatsApp, or mail.
<b>He doesn't even use himself!</b>
My sisters are worried I've been
living in your house for 4
years.
<b>So they've found groom for me.</b>
They are going to bring him
to our house in two days.
<b>What should I do now?</b>
<b>You!</b>
<b>Open your mouth and say something!</b>
<b>Speak up!</b>
<b>Say something.</b>
<b>Well...</b>
<b>Yeah? Well...?</b>
<b>The train is here.</b>
Let's go.
- Poor woman, give her an answer...
<b>Stop playing around, Mathi.</b>
<b>I really can't take this anymore.</b>
<b>Do you like me or not?</b>
You know my family won't
agree to this.
But you keep saying the same thing
over and over again.
Is there something else
on your mind?
<b>You need to tell me what it is.</b>
See, I just want you to
be there for me.
And I want to be there for you,
and give up my life to
protect yours.
Don't talk this way.
Please!
Welcome, sir.
Glad to meet you.
<b>Good morning, officers.</b>
<b>Good morning, Interpol Sir.</b>
<b>I am Anand Subramaniam.</b>
The investigating officer for the
Orissa CM's assassination
case.
Since the CMs of three states were attending
a function at
the same venue...
we had heavy security in the venue.
National Security
Guards, and 350 CRPF officers.
Last year, on December 20th,
at exactly 10:15...
<b>the Orissa CM arrived at the venue.</b>
This was the seating arrangement
for the function.
<b>The CM's seat was third from the left.</b>
<b>It was a very closed event.</b>
So we'd finalised the seating arrangements
for the functions
 several months in advance.
At exactly 12:21, when the CM
got up to deliver his
speech...
from the 8th floor balcony
of the building to his left...
<b>gun shots were fired.</b>
The bullets were fired exactly
from a trajectory angle of
118 to 120 degrees.
<b>And one of those bullets...</b>
<b>hit the CM on the left of his temple...</b>
<b>and he collapsed.</b>
<b>We confirmed this with the entry wound.</b>
We found that they'd setup a local country made gun
which
was triggered remotely.
Based on the remote censor
used in the gun...
we found out that they operated it
from within a 2 km
radius.
<b>This is the work of their state's Naxals.</b>
They are the ones who use
a lot of country made guns.
<b>These are our findings, sir.</b>
<b>We need to go to Coimbatore tomorrow.</b>
<b>I need to see the venue.</b>
<b>Sure, sir.</b>
They told me a Turkish officer
would be coming from Paris.
So I dusted my books
and started brushing up my English.
But your Tamil is good enough
to teach Tamil teachers!
Sir, a student who came to see you
is creating a scene out
there.
<b>Hey, who are you?</b>
Excuse me! Did you think
this was your school's blackboard?
<b>What the hell is happening here?</b>
<b>Is there a show going on here?</b>
Hey, idiot!
Ask her to stop, man!
<b>Get down, miss.</b>
<b>I'm done!</b>
So you are the investigating officer
for this case?
Was it you who came up
with the Naxal theory?
<b>Such terrible investigation, sir.</b>
<b>Excuse me?</b>
<b>You better mind your language.</b>
<b>Okay, okay!</b>
So you are officer Aslan.
Interpol, right?
<b>Hi!</b>
<b>Sorry, hi!</b>
I am Judith Samson.
You can call me Judy.
<b>What's all this?</b>
This is the actual investigation
of your case.
<b>His theory has a dinosaur sized loophole.</b>
<b>Do you have two minutes?</b>
<b>Hold this.</b>
<b>Play this when I tell you to.</b>
It's true that they did fire the gun remotely
to carry out
the assassination.
<b>But...</b>
it wasn't any of the bullets he mentioned
which actually
killed the CM.
<b>That isn't even possible.</b>
<b>So, what's your theory?</b>
<b>Let's just imagine...</b>
this was the CM's position at the podium
when he was
standing.
<b>This might sound hard to believe.</b>
But this is maths.
Numbers don't lie, uncle.
He single-handedly managed to pull off
such a complicated
plan so effortlessly!
You are looking for a genius who breathes numbers
every
single second of his life.
Don't be silly
and look for him here, uncle.
He must be living among numbers
in the biggest math centre
in the world.
<b>You should look there, uncle.</b>
Two threes are...?
- Two threes are six.
Algebra is not hard, Ashwini.
- Come on.
Very good. Superb!
- Come on, Mathi!
<b>I'm coming!</b>
<b>Go back to your class.</b>
I don't like the sight
of your friend's face.
<b>He is upto something.</b>
The Iron Man is always right
about these things.
<b>Be wary, son!</b>
I've made note of it.
- Sure thing! Good night.
I have no idea what
you are noticing!
He is here.
Run, run, run.
<b>Here I am.</b>
<b>He is not getting away today!</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
Oh no, where did I leave it?
Where is it?
Where is it?
- Under the tree.
<b>Here?</b>
<b>Under the bushes?</b>
There it is.
- Kumaresan...
What are you looking for?
- Found it.
<b>I can take it out now.</b>
<b>What is this?</b>
Ask anyone in the universe,
and they will tell you this is a
 bottle.
<b>And that's booze inside it.</b>
I'll teach you how to drink it
with style like an
Englishman.
The kids are waiting for me.
It's getting late.
<b>Is it something important?</b>
Whatever it is, I can tell you
only after a half an hour
time-lapse.
<b>Sit down.</b>
Even after drinking two bottles,
he still hasn't opened up
his heart.
<b>Is he human or what!</b>
I can't stand this guy's antics
after drinking just two
glasses!
<b>Oh, dear!</b>
Why don't you fall in love
and get married, Mathi?
<b>It could be a beautiful professor...</b>
or a girl who fell head-over-heels for you
and stayed in
your house for four years...
<b>or maybe a girl named Bhavana.</b>
<b>You have several such options.</b>
Why don't you tick one of the options,
fall in love, and get
 married?
<b>Let me be frank, Mathi...</b>
I don't know what
the girl sees in you.
<b>But she is always around you.</b>
She is willing to leave
everything behind for you.
<b>Please think about it, Mathi.</b>
<b>If you marry Bhavana...</b>
<b>your whole life will turn beautiful.</b>
<b>Bhavana, that poor thing.</b>
<b>Mathi, I feel sorry for Bhavana...</b>
<b>Kumaresan, are you okay?</b>
This guy...
- No, sister!
The poor guy's only got
a little bit of respect left around
here.
<b>So don't hit him with your slippers.</b>
<b>Maybe the broom...</b>
<b>no, use this instead.</b>
The girl got you booze hoping you'd open up,
but you aren't
saying anything!
<b>Please admit to it.</b>
<b>Sister, couldn't you find anyone better?</b>
<b>I know how much you like her.</b>
<b>Please admit to it, Mathi.</b>

Sir, the gunshots were fired
from that apartment balcony.
But there is such a huge structure
in front of the stage.
The shots would have
hit the structure, right?
<b>Based on the entry wound...</b>
you guessed that the bullet that hit the CM
was fired from
an angle of 118 to 120 degrees.
<b>That's okay...</b>
but it's not possible to shoot from that angle
from the
building you mentioned.
They couldn't have even seen
the CM from that building.
<b>So, what's your theory?</b>
<b>Ricochet effect.</b>
Listen... instead of a bullet,
imagine a fast approaching
car.
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>When it rams straight into a wall...</b>
it ricochets, that is bounces off the wall,
and moves in the
 opposite direction.
<b>But if the collision happens at an angle,</b>
it moves in another direction
depending on the angle.
Now imagine if the car hits a moving object,
like a train,
from an angle.
<b>Due to the train's speed...</b>
it will travel in some other angle
with several times the
original force.
<b>Excuse me!</b>
How did such a fast moving object
end up in this hall?
<b>If I'm not wrong...</b>
near the window through which
the bullet entered the
building...
there must definitely be
a wall mounted fan.
A fan that rotates at 400 rpm
in anti-clockwise direction.
<b>Anand...</b>
<b>Sir...</b>
The assassin must have been seated 4th or 5th
in the 2nd row
 of the balcony...
to get this 118 to 120 degree
ricochet angle.
<b>Chief!</b>
<b>Buddy...</b>
He waited for the right time,
and remotely fired the gun
which was outside.
He must have blind-sided everyone
by triggering it from
inside the hall.
<b>Judy is the university topper in mathematics.</b>
She left her home and her parents
to focus on maths and
research.
She chose criminology as her main elective
in her final
semester.
<b>She got obsessed with this case.</b>
She discovered that there was maths involved
in every single
 aspect of this case.
And that's how she came up
with her thesis.
<b>The Cobra.</b>
<b>Wow, what a surprise!</b>
<b>I knew you'd eventually come to me.</b>
<b>But this was too fast.</b>
<b>Anyway, welcome peeps.</b>
<b>Hi, ma'am.</b>
<b>So, CBI Uncle...</b>
<b>do you believe me atleast now?</b>
In this case, your theory
definitely makes sense.
<b>Accepted.</b>
But what's the connection between the assassinations
in
Scotland and France and this case?
<b>So far, maths is the only connection.</b>
<b>He used the blind spot in France to escape.</b>
He increased the sound to 120 decibels
at the church
wedding...
and used the vibrations
to blast the crystal bulb.
He calculated that the liquid nitrogen in it
would drip onto
 the steel chain and corrode it...
and that the chain would be unable
to bear the 3.5 tonne
load and eventually snap.
And the calculation that when it falls
from a height of 25
feet...
it will fall with a force of 300 Pascals
and split the
ground open!
Maths was the only common factor
in each and every single
move.
<b>Then how did he find the tunnel and escape?</b>
Aslan, that church was built
in the 16th century.
Back in those days in Scotland,
to help the refugees
escape...
there were several secret
tunnels built under churches.
<b>That is known history.</b>
<b>And his escape was very simple.</b>
He used an ancient wartime strategy
like A Star algorithm...
found the shortest exit route
from the church...
<b>and escaped in a flash!</b>
<b>Sir, I don't understand anything.</b>
Are you going to listen
to this little girl's story...
and use her college notebook
to do your investigation?
Anand, Interpol aren't idiots to come all this way
blindly
trusting some little girl's theory.
<b>Sir, that wasn't what I meant.</b>
In ML algorithm, there is a study called
cloud of line
distribution.
It analyses the strokes
of a person's handwriting...
and accurately predicts which part
of the world he is from.
<b>The guy who killed the Prince in Scotland...</b>
made an accurate forgery of the father's signature
at the
palace he was staying at.
Upon analysing the signature,
we found out he wasn't
European.
<b>He is an Asian.</b>
<b>To be more precise...</b>
we found of that the chances
of him being an Indian is very
high.
<b>That's when I came across Judy's thesis.</b>
And the Indian connection
got me curious.
The signature we found
at Coimbatore yesterday...
<b>was in Tamil.</b>
When I analysed those strokes,
it got confirmed...
<b>that he is an Indian.</b>
<b>And a Tamilian.</b>
<b>Wow, really?</b>
<b>Why are you getting excited about this?</b>
<b>Ma'am, he is a genius!</b>
I'm proud that
he is one of us.
<b>Oh, god!</b>
Are you okay with
helping us in this case?
Don't you dare play
too hard to get!
<b>What do you expect, ma'am?</b>
I've already told you
that maths is the common factor.
There must be one other connecting factor
behind all these
people who died.
<b>Either a common story.</b>
<b>Or a common enemy.</b>
<b>There must definitely be something.</b>
Maybe if they find out
what that is...
I can atleast do my bit
to help stop the next assassination.
But be assured,
that's easier said than done.
<b>He is a cobra.</b>
The most intelligent among
all the snakes.
He knows how to change his appearance
and shift from one
form to another.
He also knows to patiently hide
and wait for his target...
<b>and strike within the blink of an eye.</b>
<b>Let's see.</b>
<b>Let's play this game.</b>
Tamil, I've proofed the Su-Do-Ku puzzle
and sent it across.
- Okay, sir.
Get it printed.
- Sure, sir.
I scored the top marks
in the mid term exams, sir.
Hello, sir!
Haven't seen you in a while.
<b>How are you?</b>
<b>Thanks!</b>
Wow, what a style!
Beautiful.
<b>You must see this.</b>
<b>I'm talking to you!</b>
Why is your sister-in-law whistling
through her nose?
The entire family is inside.
Be careful!
<b>We are unable to show face in town.</b>
How can you just leave and come here
to live with some
random guy?
<b>Imagine what people would say!</b>
<b>They'd say I am living with him!</b>
What's your problem
with accepting him?
No matter what happens,
I won't get you married to him.
I need to use the computer.
- Hello, sir...
That system is free.
Can you use that?
Mathi asked you to top up
this number for 129 rupees.
<b>Fine, I'll do it in the morning.</b>
<b>Hello, sir?</b>
<b>I just got the confirmation.</b>
Send his payment to those
50 charitable trusts.
Okay, sir.
Thank you.
<b>What is your daughter even saying?</b>
If she isn't interested in this marriage,
why did you invite
 us?
Brother, please...
- No point talking anymore.
<b>Meena Sister, please listen to me.</b>
She is making up stuff
just to spite us.
<b>None of what she says is true.</b>
Why are you still talking?
Start fighting!
<b>Get the hell out of here!</b>
Let's leave.
- Be quiet!
Brother, please wait...
- Go away, you devil.
<b>What kind of family is this?</b>
<b>Cheers!</b>
<b>Yeah, baby!</b>
<b>The big boy has run helter-skelter--</b>
<b>Stop it, you brainless moron!</b>
<b>What do you think of yourself?</b>
How dare you humiliate all of us
for the sake of some random
 guy?
<b>Is he more important to you than us?</b>
<b>Who is he?</b>
How can we get you married to him
without knowing about his
family and background?
He is raising some random orphan boy,
calling him 'little
one'.
He prays to the sketch of some random woman,
referring to
her as his mother.
<b>He hasn't said a thing about his family.</b>
How can we get you married
to such a man?
Don't run your mouth.
- You shut up!
If he was born into a good family
and raised by a good
mother...
he wouldn't take an innocent girl home
and make her family
suffer.
<b>Just ignore what she says.</b>
No one born into a good family--
- Shut up!
<b>That's your limit.</b>
<b>Don't run your mouth unnecessarily.</b>
If he wanted to,
he could have already married me...
made me cut ties with all of you,
and live a happy married
life.
Instead, he valued all of you and insisted
that we need your
 consent for the wedding.
<b>And look at how you treated him in return!</b>
<b>Get out of my sight.</b>
<b>I don't need any of you.</b>
He is the only person
I need in my life.
<b>Get it?</b>
<b>He is all I need.</b>
<b>What's this, Bhavana?</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
Mathi, please don't take
anything they said to heart.
<b>Please!</b>
<b>Let me apologise on their behalf.</b>
<b>I am the one who should apologise.</b>
I shouldn't have strung you along
when I knew this will
never happen.
Why do you say
this won't happen?
<b>Because they won't agree to it?</b>
<b>Who are they to decide my life?</b>
You like me,
and I like you.
<b>I don't like you, Bhavana.</b>
<b>What are you saying, Mathi?</b>
<b>I respect you and the social work you do.</b>
But that...
- Are you saying that isn't love?
<b>You are lying, Mathi.</b>
I know how your face changes
when you lie.
I know what the smallest of movements
in your eyes mean.
<b>What they said was wrong.</b>
<b>Just tell me what I should do now.</b>
<b>This won't happen.</b>
<b>Listen to your family.</b>
Leave this house.
- What are you saying?
<b>I won't leave, Mathi.</b>
Even if you say it a thousand times,
I won't leave.
<b>I will continue to live here.</b>
<b>I'd even give my life for you.</b>
<b>Don't say that again and again, Bhavana!</b>
I don't want anyone
to sacrifice their life for me.
What should I say
to make you leave?
<b>I told you several times not to stay here.</b>
<b>But you never listened!</b>
<b>I really don't like you.</b>
<b>I don't want you.</b>
<b>I don't want anyone else except you, Mathi.</b>
Without you,
I don't know if I can...
Will you atleast come to see me
when I die someday?
Atleast on that day,
don't lie about not liking me...
and whisper the truth
into my ears atleast once, Mathi.
<b>I won't disturb you anymore.</b>
<b>Bhavana...</b>
Bhavana, please stop.
- Sister, please!
<b>Bhavana, listen to me.</b>
<b>Very good!</b>
<b>You did really well there!</b>
If this is your decision,
you could have said it four years
ago.
<b>Give me one reason why you don't like her.</b>
<b>Should I say it?</b>
<b>Jennifer.</b>
<b>I love you.</b>
You are doing this because
you are still thinking about her.
<b>This is wrong, Mathi.</b>
<b>Very, very wrong.</b>
<b>Yeah, next one?</b>
<b>Hello, sir.</b>
<b>What's the purpose of your trip?</b>
<b>What's the purpose of your trip?</b>
<b>Holiday.</b>
<b>Oh, holiday?</b>
<b>Enjoy your trip.</b>
<b>I will.</b>
Sir, someone has hacked into
all the servers to print these.
Not just here,
but all the floors in this building.
<b>This is going to be his next hit.</b>
<b>How do you know?</b>
<b>Has this happened before?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>It happened once previously.</b>
<b>Same fashion.</b>
They hacked the Interpol servers,
just like this.
<b>But...</b>
<b>who is doing this?</b>
Either he is doing this himself
to increase the thrill
factor...
or someone who wants him to get caught
is doing this.
<b>But what does this mean?</b>
<b>HKG</b>
<b>I've seen this somewhere.</b>
<b>James, is this Hong Kong?</b>
Yes, Chief.
You are right.
<b>HKG is Hong Kong.</b>
<b>What about LED then?</b>
<b>St. Petersburg, Russia.</b>
He is travelling from Hong Kong
to St. Petersburg to do
something.
<b>Alert the Russian Intelligence.</b>
Make a list of all passengers who travelled
from Hong Kong
over the last week.
<b>But these numbers...</b>
<b>there is some clue in it.</b>
<b>Don't worry, Aslan.</b>
My mind's been at it
for a while now.
Give me sometime.
I'll get this.
James, I need details on all the important events
scheduled
to happen in St. Petersburg this week.
<b>Hello?</b>
<b>This is Nawab speaking.</b>
The Interpol have tracked
your man all the way to Russia.
What the hell have you done?
Idiots!
<b>Come to the hotel immediately.</b>
<b>Sir, we received your mail.</b>
<b>In fact, due to security reasons...</b>
we have cancelled all events 
in St. Petersburg for the next
 one week.
<b>Because the president is visiting here.</b>
<b>The president is visiting the city?</b>
<b>When?</b>
<b>Day after tomorrow.</b>
The People's Front Party
are hosting a big event here.
The Russian President, his cabinet ministers,
and several
other international delegates will be here...
<b>to meet the party's supporters.</b>
<b>Fish!</b>
Nellai, how did this information
get leaked?
I'm wondering too.
Maybe it got leaked from your side...
There is no chance
of an information leak from my side.
<b>Tell him to come back.</b>
<b>Your guy is going to get caught.</b>
<b>If Rishi's name comes out...</b>
<b>all of us will be in danger.</b>
<b>This isn't some game, Nellaiappan.</b>
<b>Come back?</b>
Once he gets started on a mission,
I can't even reach him.
Everything will go as per plan.
Don't worry.
<b>Yes, Officer Aslan?</b>
<b>I heard about the purpose of your visit.</b>
<b>So, what are you saying?</b>
<b>General, we have to stop this event.</b>
Because some important person
could get killed in it.
<b>Who do you think that could be?</b>
I don't know.
It could even be the president.
<b>Listen, officer...</b>
<b>I understand your concerns.</b>
But this event is a matter of
honour and prestige for our
country.
<b>We can't cancel it under any circumstances.</b>
You believe some random hacker who says
the Russian
President will be killed on Russian soil?
<b>It is so laughable.</b>
<b>This is Russia, officer.</b>
Our defence and security is
much more powerful than you can
imagine.
<b>What's going on?</b>
General, you've got to come out
and see this.
<b>Someone has hacked our entire defence tower.</b>
<b>Lazy fellows!</b>
How long does it take for you
to come out?
<b>Tell them to shut the tower down.</b>
Hey, Aslan!
- Shut the tower down immediately.
<b>This is a small gift from me.</b>
<b>For you, my friend.</b>
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Here you go.</b>
Your guy is going to get caught.
Tell him to come back.
<b>If Rishi's name comes out...</b>
Listen carefully.
- All of us will be in danger.
Your guy is going to get caught.
Tell him to come back.
<b>If Rishi's name comes out...</b>
<b>Rishi... Rishi... Rishi... Rishi...</b>
Some guy is giving us
all this information...
but why isn't he revealing
the identity of the assassin?
Maybe he doesn't know how or
under what guise the assassin
would come.
What if he is just sharing
whatever information he has with
us...
because he wants to
get the assassin caught?
<b>Rishi, Rishi, Rishi...</b>
<b>Listen, listen...</b>
Listen, listen, listen,
listen, listen, listen!
<b>Rajiv Rishi of Rishi Corporations.</b>
<b>He is the connecting factor.</b>
Orissa's CM, the Prince of Scotland,
the Mayor in France...
all of them opposed Rishi
and Rishi Corp one way or the
other.
<b>So, who could his target in Russia be?</b>
<b>It could be Dimitri Yugoslav.</b>
<b>He is an important leader.</b>
<b>Our country's Defence Minister.</b>
<b>Yes, it is the Defence Minister.</b>
<b>How do you know?</b>
<b>It is simple maths.</b>
<b>4136P66</b>
P is for point.
So, 4136.66
<b>The square is 17111955.</b>
<b>17-11-1955</b>
<b>Defence Minister's birthday.</b>
Defence Minister Dimitri is involved
in an arms racket with
Rishi Corp.
The Defence Minister shut down
Rishi Corp's operations in
Russia to save himself.
<b>This has to be him.</b>
<b>Officer Aslan, what do we do now?</b>
We can't cancel this event
at any cost.
At the same time, we have to
stop this assassination too.
<b>The assassin will be stopped, General.</b>
I won't let him
take one step forward!
No matter what calculations
your genius comes up with...
<b>He only plays with numbers.</b>
I will give him more numbers
to play with this time.
<b>Good morning, St. Petersburg.</b>
<b>We are outside the Presidential Palace.</b>
Thousands of supporters of the People's Party
have gathered
here.
The President will be leaving shortly
for the event with his
 top ministers.
Nikolai, what are you gawking at?
Hurry up!
Right away!
- Flash news...
<b>Roll it!</b>
<b>Rolling...</b>
The Defence Ministry has made
an important announcement just
 now.
According to it, the venue of the event
has been shifted due
 to security concerns.
We've received information that the event
will now happen at
 Paul Fortress.
The Defence Ministry has requested all party members
and
supporters to gather at Paul Fortress.
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>Okay, good.</b>
<b>Could they have received any information?</b>
<b>Who is that guy?</b>
<b>Hang on.</b>
<b>Paul Fortress.</b>
It's on a tiny island
on Neva river.
There is only one way
to get there.
I'm sure they must have locked
and secured the entire area.
What do you say?
Are we doing it?
<b>Genius, are we doing it?</b>
<b>Body double.</b>
They've played us with a body double
while the real defence
minister was here all along.
<b>Alright, get ready.</b>
<b>So this will be our eyes.</b>
<b>You sure we don't have any blind spots?</b>
<b>No, sir.</b>
We have covered the venue
from all sides.
All cameras...
are you guys ready?
<b>This game is about to end.</b>
<b>Snipers, take positions.</b>
<b>Alpha, ready.</b>
<b>Delta, ready.</b>
Seize the place.
Close all the exits.
<b>It's locked.</b>
<b>Scanners...</b>
<b>This was a trap for us.</b>
Our fingerprints won't match
with the ones on the biometric
scanner.
We will get caught for sure.
There is no way we can escape.
<b>What are we going to do now?</b>
<b>It's very hard.</b>
<b>Get the hell out of here.</b>
<b>No chance!</b>
<b>We must do something immediately.</b>
<b>We are locked.</b>
<b>See, looks like you are scared!</b>
You can't do it, can you?
- But you can!
<b>Only you can do it!</b>
<b>Think!</b>
<b>Think!</b>
<b>Think hard!</b>
<b>Don't do it!</b>
<b>Escape!</b>
<b>Please listen to me.</b>
<b>You will listen to me, won't you?</b>
<b>Listen to me!</b>
Don't do this.
Get out of here.
<b>Hold on!</b>
<b>Where do you think you are going?</b>
Looks like someone finally beat you 
at numbers and boxed
you in!
<b>You are a dead man today.</b>
We are losing time, genius.
We are losing time!
Stay focused.
Your mind shouldn't be here.
<b>Your mind shouldn't be here.</b>
<b>Notice every little detail.</b>
<b>You will surely find a loophole.</b>
<b>Go there!</b>
The security team is in
an arrowhead formation.
They will secure the minister
in exactly 1.45 seconds
reaction time.
<b>Everyone is saying different things--</b>
<b>He has found something!</b>
<b>Disturbance!</b>
<b>Ma, something smells really bad here.</b>
<b>Let's leave, Ma.</b>
<b>Ma, something smells really bad here.</b>
<b>Let's leave, Ma.</b>
<b>It's methane gas.</b>
The manholes in a sewer channel
are generally connected.
And yes, the next manhole
is right next to the stage.
We just need to set off
a small spark in this manhole.
<b>We can blow up the entire stage.</b>
<b>He's got it!</b>
He's got an idea!
He's done it!
<b>Boom!</b>
Camera crew...
is anyone on the line?
Is anyone connected? Please reply.
- Have we lost all the
visuals?
Not even one is active?
- Sir, I think everyone is injured.
We aren't receiving visuals
from any of them.
Sir, we are receiving visuals
from camera 7.
<b>Camera 7, can you hear me?</b>
I need a visual of the minister.
Do you copy?
Do you copy?
- Copy that.
Sir, he can hear us.
- Good.
<b>Ask camera 7 to keep moving forward.</b>
And get me the visual on
the giant screen. - Yes, sir.
<b>Camera 7, go inside the tunnel.</b>
<b>Get closer to the minister.</b>
I hadn't planned such a
painful death for you.
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Call the paramedics!</b>
<b>It's an emergency.</b>
<b>Where could he escape from here?</b>
Sir, he can't escape anywhere
from this river.
The water is so cold, no one can
survive for more than 2
minutes.
<b>He will surely get caught.</b>
Sir, he isn't the actual press reporter
from RT.
<b>Oh, damn!</b>
Officer, we've circulated
his photo everywhere.
We've informed all the airports
and sea ports.
<b>There is no way he can escape.</b>
Here are your reports.
Consult the doctor. - Okay, miss.
Whatever it is,
make it quick.
<b>Because I need to go home.</b>
<b>I have a family of my own.</b>
I can't live a solitary life
by shunning everyone around me.
Kumaresan, if you want to go home,
just go already.
<b>Don't annoy me.</b>
<b>Why are you getting annoyed?</b>
We are the ones who should
be annoyed by what you do!
A girl trusted you and came home
but you chased her away.
Where did she go?
Is she alive or dead?
<b>You don't care, do you?</b>
Not just you, none of us
can see Bhavana again.
In Sudan, they have a reform school
in the desert...
for children who get involved in
guns, drugs, and terrorism.
She's signed an agreement to serve
there for 15 years.
<b>She is going to leave.</b>
<b>Her flight is tomorrow.</b>
<b>Mr. Mathiyazhagan...</b>
<b>Seizures, hyperthermia.</b>
Did you go to any cold places
in the recent past?
<b>Yes, doctor.</b>
He'd gone to Valparai to teach children,
and got back only
this morning.
He's been complaining of bad chills
and head aches since he
got back.
<b>Seriously, Mr. Mathi?</b>
Does it get that cold
in Valparai these days?
<b>Mathi, he is talking to you!</b>
<b>Enlargement of ventricles.</b>
<b>The cortical volume has reduced.</b>
Is there anything unusual about
Mathi's behaviour in recent
times?
No, doctor.
No such thing.
Mathi, do you have any prior history
of mental illness?
Has anyone diagnosed you
for schizophrenia?
<b>Or disorders like schizoid?</b>
<b>I won't leave, Mathi.</b>
Even if you say it a thousand times,
I won't leave.
<b>I will continue to live here.</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Do you hear me?</b>
See, I just want you to
be there for me.
I can see you are really confused
about something.
<b>I don't need anyone else except you, Mathi.</b>
I can do something only if you
tell me what that is.
<b>Is there something else in your mind?</b>
I will know what it is
only if you tell me.
Have you had extreme depression
or anxiety attacks in the
past?
<b>Can you tell me about your past?</b>
You are doing this because
of something from your past!
<b>To help you get over me...</b>
an angel will come to shower you
with love and attention.
<b>I love you.</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Do you hallucinate?</b>
<b>Do you hear things that no one else does?</b>
<b>Or see things no one else does?</b>
<b>Do you hallucinate?</b>
<b>He's got some plan!</b>
<b>I'll take care of it.</b>
Sure, go ahead.
Good night!
<b>Don't do it.</b>
<b>You sure?</b>
<b>Good, then.</b>
<b>What happened, doctor?</b>
You mentioned hallucinations etc.
Is it something serious?
See, there are two categories
of people who hallucinate.
The first category can't tell apart
what is real and what is
 not...
so they get mentally affected
and become very serious.
But the other category can tell apart
what is real and what
is not.
They are smart enough to accept it
and learn to live with
it.
<b>They might appear very normal too.</b>
I had to ask because I suspected
that could be the case with
 him.
<b>Your guy is going to get caught.</b>
<b>Tell him to come back.</b>
<b>If Rishi's name comes out...</b>
Officer, before you start accusing
our Capo...
I'm sure your forensic analyst team
verified Nawab's video.
Can you tell me the
date and time stamp on it?
It was three days ago.
At 10 pm IST.
Perfect! These are
Nawab's termination papers.
<b>We fired him exactly 74 days ago.</b>
There is no connection between Nawab
and our Capo or Rishi
Corporations.
What Nawab was referring to in the video
could be something
completely unconnected, right?
Look here, officer.
Let's not beat around the bush.
<b>Our records are clean.</b>
<b>We are ready to cooperate with you.</b>
<b>If you still suspect Capo...</b>
<b>arrest Nawab and conduct an enquiry...</b>
and declare to the whole world
that our Capo is a good
person.
I will arrest Nawab
if you tell me where you are hiding him.
<b>Sorry?</b>
Nawab went missing 10 minutes
after we received the video.
<b>Tell me where he is.</b>
<b>Why are you asking us?</b>
<b>It's your job to find him!</b>
<b>Are you playing a game with me?</b>
<b>I'm almost there.</b>
<b>I won't spare any of you.</b>
I am going to hold your Capo
by his collar and drag him--
<b>Excuse me, officer!</b>
It will be nice if you can
maintain some decorum!
You don't get to run your mouth
because we treat you with
respect.
When the main witness goes missing
in a case as big as
this...
I can understand how frustrated
you must be.
<b>But don't you dare take it out on us.</b>
What you should do is
deploy a big team for this...
and search every country,
every city, every street out
there.
<b>Isn't that what you are paid for?</b>
It's the sweetest dish
I've had in my entire life.
<b>I'm all yours, Capo.</b>
<b>I'm missing you already.</b>
When a 22 year old punk
gets all this money and power...
I am just beginning to realise what
his corrupt little brain
 can be capable of.
<b>Actually you are right, officer.</b>
<b>My brain, my hands, my legs...</b>
and the lips that she just kissed
are just 22 years old.
But the blood that runs in my veins
has been doing corporate
 business for 120 years.
We know what to do
and how to do it.
<b>Buzz off!</b>
<b>Capo, no!</b>
Please, Capo.
Don't...
<b>Please, no...</b>
I'll buy out the CBI
and make you my employee!
<b>Capo, he is from the Interpol.</b>
What?
- Yeah...
<b>Shit!</b>
<b>That hurts, man.</b>
<b>What have you done, Uncle?</b>
Random guys are coming
and threatening me!
Sorry, Rishi.
I was very careful.
But I don't know where and how
it got leaked.
<b>Champagne, uncle?</b>
<b>No thanks.</b>
<b>Oh, come on.</b>
<b>Who is this Nellaiappan?</b>
<b>Since when have you had this link?</b>
About six years ago, you'd asked me to
finish off an
important witness in a jail in Ukraine.
<b>That wasn't an easy job.</b>
We got it done through
Nellai's guy.
Since then, we have been using
only Nellaiappan and his guy
to kill people.
<b>And who is this guy?</b>
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>I don't know who he is.</b>
I tried to find out who he is
several times.
<b>But I couldn't.</b>
<b>Does that guy know about us?</b>
<b>He does.</b>
<b>Wow!</b>
<b>That's so cool.</b>
So, who is this guy passing information
to the Interpol?
<b>I don't know.</b>
<b>You don't know anything!</b>
Uncle, do you remember
what you always said?
That you would be honest
with me and the company.
<b>And that you'd do anything for us.</b>
<b>So sweet!</b>
Uncle, you must be, what,
65 years old now?
Oh yeah, we just celebrated
your birthday!
<b>So you hardly have another 7-10 years left.</b>
<b>Give up those 10 years for me, uncle.</b>
<b>Rishi!</b>
<b>Rishi, what are you saying?</b>
<b>You're joking, right?</b>
No, uncle.
I'm very serious!
<b>Now it's all gone beyond limits.</b>
This is the only way we can
fix things, uncle. Please!
It's just 10 years, uncle.
Give it up!
Rishi, don't hurt me.
- Oh, no!
I'll just go away somewhere. Please, Rishi...
- Uncle,
please don't beg me like this.
Please, uncle.
- Please don't hurt me, Rishi.
Make sure he doesn't feel any pain.
- I won't say a word to
anyone.
<b>My dear uncle.</b>
Please, uncle.
- Rishi, please spare me.
Don't do it!
- Rishi...
No, no, no.
Uncle, please.
I'm already high
and having a bad trip.
Please don't do this, uncle.
It makes me very uncomfortable.
<b>Uncle, this is feeling terrible.</b>
Just hold steady and be still,
I'll finish it off quickly.
<b>Please, uncle!</b>
Oh, damn.
I warned you, didn't I?
I told you I was high
and asked you to stay still!
<b>Nellaiappan, the assassin...</b>
and that freak who is giving tip offs
from the outside...
<b>none of them should live.</b>
<b>Just clean up everything.</b>
<b>Every god-damn thing.</b>
Baby... the breeze is
so cold, isn't it?
I'll get us a cab.
Stay right here.
<b>Listen...</b>
I'll get us a cab.
Stay right here.
<b>Don't buy that newspaper.</b>
<b>Do you realise what you are doing?</b>
<b>Don't do this.</b>
You are killing random people
for total strangers.
<b>They are using you.</b>
<b>You are a good person.</b>
<b>Only I know that.</b>
It's not fair to dwell on the past
and make another woman
suffer for it.
You know I am saying this
for your own good, don't you?
<b>This isn't the life for you.</b>
<b>You should be with Bhavana.</b>
<b>That is where your life lies.</b>
<b>Let's leave all of this behind.</b>
Stop, don't do it.
Listen to me.
Think about everything we've lost
to get the life we wanted.
<b>Please!</b>
<b>See...</b>
<b>you are shedding tears.</b>
<b>This is who you are.</b>
Knowingly or unknowingly,
don't make another mistake.
<b>Let's go and get Bhavana.</b>
<b>Stop here.</b>
Mathi, wait!
Where are you going?
For the first time,
I am in your place.
<b>I finally understand the pain.</b>
You said you'd never leave
even if I tell you to.
<b>I just want to ask three questions.</b>
<b>Then I'll leave.</b>
If I tell you we don't need
anyone's permission...
<b>and ask you to come with me now...</b>
<b>will you come with me or not?</b>
If I tell you that I won't let you down
for a hundred
years...
<b>will you come with me or not?</b>
If I tell you I will never ask you to leave
even if my life
depends on it...
<b>will you...</b>
<b>come with me?</b>
<b>Or not?</b>
<b>She will come with you.</b>
If she doesn't,
I will convince her.
<b>Go, Bhavana.</b>

General, we found cyanide needles

He's imported this cyanide and some other gadgets
through
different forms from Finland.
<b>Not just this.</b>
He had planned a big blast

It's just a matter of time, General.
I'll get him.

<b>So, teacher...</b>
<b>Have you eaten?</b>
What about you, teacher?
Have you eaten?
Hey, Judy...
aren't you sleeping yet?
I was unable to fall asleep.
So I just went for a walk.
<b>You know Judy, don't you?</b>
<b>She is my most favourite student.</b>
<b>Maybe you don't know about us.</b>
<b>But we know a lot about you.</b>
You made her lament
quite a bit!
<b>So...</b>
<b>I heard you are scary good at maths!</b>
<b>Oh, I forgot to mention...</b>
<b>She is not from criminology.</b>
<b>She is a mathematician.</b>
She is working with the Interpol
on a really big case at the
 moment.
<b>Oh...</b>
<b>Nice!</b>
Are you wondering what's the connection
between maths and
crime?
<b>There is this genius mathematician!</b>
He is using maths to carry out
several assassinations...
<b>and he is getting away with it!</b>
<b>We are trying to find him.</b>
<b>Judy, I wanted to ask you...</b>
<b>how did your Russia visit go?</b>
<b>Oh, ma'am...</b>
<b>it was perfectly setup, ma'am.</b>
<b>Like, perfect!</b>
<b>There is this hacker.</b>
He's been feeding information to the Interpol
all along
using this joker character.
We used that information
and almost got to him.
<b>We were that close to him.</b>
<b>That close!</b>
Finally, we couldn't even get
a hair strand as evidence.
<b>Cobra is the real deal, ma'am.</b>
<b>Just, wow.</b>
Cobra!
- That's enough. Leave now.
<b>Okay, you guys carry on!</b>
<b>Bye!</b>
<b>Okay, the time is...</b>
<b>What sort of dress sense is this?</b>
<b>With your shirt tucked in!</b>
<b>Why are you squirming?</b>
If you start squirming or shying away
when I come close to
you...
<b>I'll kill you!</b>
<b>You see this?</b>
You are registered as my property now.
You are done for!
That is the first thing that should
come to your mind when
you see this!
<b>Okay?</b>
<b>It's beautiful.</b>
<b>Look at that!</b>
I had no idea
you notice and admire these things!
It will turn into a
deeper shade of red tomorrow.
It will look beautiful during the wedding
when it turns into
 a deeper shade of red.
<b>Damn you, grandpa!</b>
I need to break his TV already!
- Let me take care of it.
[news] On account of the official visit
of Japanese
diplomats to Kolkata...
an emergency council meeting has been scheduled
under the
leadership of DGP Ganguly.
At the house of Hindustan Today's senior
journalist
Nellaiyappan in Kumurtali, Kolkata...
three family members were found dead
after they consumed
poison and committed suicide.
The police have setup a special team
to search for the
missing Nellaiyappan.
They are also questioning people
close to him.
<b>I know him very well.</b>
He didn't have any debts.
He actually had a lot of savings.
But now they are saying
he's got no money in his account.
<b>Something is wrong.</b>
The police are cooking up some story
to divert this case.
The truth will come out
only if we find Nellai Sir.
I knew the Interpol guy was going to
sniff everything out.
<b>And now he is nearing us.</b>
<b>If it was the Interpol...</b>
they would have arrested him
and gone down the legal route.
<b>But that's not what happened.</b>
<b>Nellai is in some trouble.</b>
<b>Oh, I see!</b>
Maybe that was what he was trying
to say through the
newspaper, Dad?
<b>Did we make a mistake?</b>
Do you have the Hindustan Today newspaper
dated December
27th?
You want a newspaper
from two days ago?
We don't keep it here.
It's at the warehouse.
<b>Where is that?</b>
<b>Take a left turn there.</b>
Hello, excuse me. The newspapers--
- Everything is in there.
Hindustan...
- In there.
<b>Go and take it for yourself.</b>
Does this mean he sent some details
through this mail, Dad?
<b>No way!</b>
<b>No chance at all.</b>
He knows we will never use mail or phones
under any
circumstances for safety reasons.
<b>Something is wrong.</b>
Maybe he was in a situation where
the only option he had was
 to send a mail.
<b>No, this is not safe.</b>
<b>Something is fishy!</b>
<b>We have no idea what happened to Nellai.</b>
Three people are dead
at his house.
Are we still going to go on
and on about safety...
or are we going to try to find out
what happened at his
house?
The shop shuts in 30 minutes.
Hurry up. - Yeah, okay.
<b>Hello?</b>
<b>Mic testing 1,2, 3.</b>
<b>Do you recognise him?</b>
<b>Your wonderful godfather!</b>
It looks like he is getting
a nice massage, doesn't it?
<b>No!</b>
<b>This is called Chinese water torture.</b>
When the water falls
drop after drop after drop...
<b>it can even dent a rock, you know?</b>
So imagine, if it can deform a rock,
what would happen to
your old man's head?
<b>As time passes...</b>
every drop that falls on his head
will feel like...
<b>boom!</b>
<b>Boom!</b>
<b>It will feel like thunder.</b>
His mind will be consumed with fear
about the next drop that
 would fall on him.
<b>Boom!</b>
<b>Slowly but surely...</b>
<b>his brain's rhythm will break...</b>
<b>and he will lose his consciousness!</b>
<b>Then the old man will blurt everything out.</b>
<b>Everything.</b>
<b>Every single secret.</b>
<b>Oh, I forgot to mention...</b>
other than you, the CBI are also
watching this video as we
speak.
Who is this?
Who sent this to us?
Don't know, sir.
An unknown ID shared this link.
<b>It's streaming on the dark web.</b>
Only those who know about this link
can open it.
<b>Forward this link to me.</b>
<b>Hey, don't worry!</b>
<b>I won't rat you out so easily.</b>
This old man isn't going
to speak up easily either.
<b>5 seconds into 2 feet height...</b>
into 3600 seconds
divided by 5...
<b>plus, plus what...</b>
<b>plus this guy's age!</b>
<b>I don't know how to calculate this.</b>
<b>You are good at maths, aren't you?</b>
<b>I think you only have about 30-31 hours.</b>
Before that, try to save
this old man's life if you can...
<b>and save yourself too, okay?</b>
<b>I don't know who you are.</b>
<b>But I can see I am your target.</b>
You thought you were
attacking me...
but you've stepped into
a quagmire instead.
<b>A quagmire named Rishi Corp.</b>
<b>Thirty hours to go!</b>
You have no idea
how dangerous he is.
<b>He will definitely--</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Are you trying to scare me?</b>
<b>You math head...</b>
<b>your calculations won't work with me.</b>
<b>I don't care about anything.</b>
<b>Not even death.</b>
<b>All I need is you.</b>
I want to watch you
run for your life and die.
<b>Your countdown begins now.</b>
<b>Run!</b>
<b>I said, run!</b>
I just got a call saying
they found our car at the airport.
<b>The groom isn't there.</b>
They said they'd talk to the airlines
and find out which
city he's gone to.
<b>He's left the city?</b>
<b>What is this, Kumaresan?</b>
We are just two hours away
from the wedding.
<b>The guests have started to come in.</b>
<b>What is this, brother?</b>
<b>Why can't I ever understand him?</b>
<b>Things were going just fine.</b>
<b>Did I say something wrong?</b>
<b>Or do something wrong?</b>
Or did I just pester him
into agreeing to this marriage?
<b>But, no.</b>
<b>He was the one who came to me.</b>
No, I'm sure he went
on some emergency.
<b>But is he safe?</b>
Can you please find out
what happened to him?
Why do you care
what happens to him anymore?
<b>How can you say that, brother?</b>
<b>You don't need him.</b>
<b>He isn't right for you.</b>
I don't mean to say
he is a bad person.
He is just not able
to accept you, Bhavana.
<b>Fifteen years ago...</b>
I met Mathi in Kolkata
for the first time.
<b>He didn't know me back then.</b>
<b>But the whole neighbourhood...</b>
<b>knew him and Jennifer very well.</b>
<b>Jennifer?</b>
<b>Yes.</b>
<b>Mathi was in love with Jennifer.</b>
<b>Sincerely.</b>
<b>I don't know who jinxed it.</b>
<b>They said you are perfectly fine.</b>
Sign this statement which says you are fine
and get going.
<b>Sir, my phone got lost somewhere.</b>
<b>Let's talk about that later.</b>
<b>This concerns the Commissioner's daughter.</b>
<b>Sign now.</b>
But, sir...
- Just sign it, man.
<b>Get his signature.</b>
<b>Just sign it, kid.</b>
<b>Sir...</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
<b>My leg...</b>
<b>Doctor!</b>
Has he signed?
- Yes, sir.
<b>Wait outside.</b>
<b>Daddy, this is not fair.</b>
We should take care
of his treatment.
<b>How can we just leave him like this?</b>
<b>You shut up, Jenny.</b>
She hits some random guy on the road
and insists on treating
 him at a big hospital!
I should have thought about this
before giving you the car.
Discharge him
and send him away, Indu.
No, aunty.
Please don't listen to him.
<b>Treat him, aunty.</b>
<b>You say it's a serious fracture too.</b>
I'll pay you later.
No, actually...
Keep this, and please give the boy
the treatment he needs.
<b>Jenny, what are you doing!</b>
You wear your mother's bracelet
in memory of her.
You'd never take this off
for any reason.
Who is that boy?
Your boyfriend?
<b>Come on, aunty.</b>
Does he need to be my boyfriend
or friend for me to extend
support to him?
<b>Then what?</b>
<b>Poor guy, aunty.</b>
It's been hours since
he got injured.
But not one person
has come to see him yet.
<b>They told me he has nobody.</b>
<b>If his mother was still around...</b>
she'd have panicked and rushed here
to see if her son is
doing okay.
<b>I kind of feel really bad for him.</b>
So please,
don't overthink it.
<b>Just perform the operation he needs.</b>
Sure, but you should first--
- Keep it!
After he wakes up,
please give this to him.
Okay, aunty?
Bye.
<b>Jenny, take this back.</b>
<b>Jenny!</b>
Chaitra, complete the formalities for
the accident case...
and prepare for surgery this evening.
- Okay, doctor.
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Mathi, you are so...</b>
<b>stupid?</b>
Did you have to use your phone
while crossing the road, you
fool?
Imagine what would have happened
if I had mowed you down!
<b>I should have done it.</b>
You know how much I love
driving a car.
Now because of you,
they won't let me drive a car again.
<b>I will never forgive you for this.</b>
<b>I heard you were my classma--</b>
<b>class--</b>
<b>Classmate?</b>
I should never see you
for the next four years.
<b>Don't ever fall in my sight!</b>
<b>I hate you.</b>
<b>I hate you.</b>
<b>I hate you.</b>

Are you still going to call this
mere friendship, Mathi?
Don't call this a mere friendship
and lie to yourself.
I don't know what's the reason
behind your hesitation.
But I can definitely say
I can't live without you.
<b>Not even for a second.</b>
<b>I love you.</b>
<b>I swear on myself.</b>
Don't break the promise
under any cost.
Aslan, the man you are looking for
is called Nellaiappan.
He is a journalist.
He's been missing for three days now.
The video you saw in Russia
was shot at the spa in Tulip
Park Hotel.
Nellai has gone to the hotel several times
to use the spa.
Nawab was in the hotel
at the same time.
<b>But we don't have any CCTV footage...</b>
which shows both of them in the same room
or that they even
met at all.
I've attached the snaps
from the CCTV.
<b>So the hacker was right again.</b>
Nellai is our trump card.
- Yes!
Check for any calls, messages or transactions
between them
through some closed circle...
Yes, we did a complete verification,
just like you asked us
to.
There are no calls, messages, emails
or transactions between
 Nellai and Nawab.
But we found several calls made between
Nellai and Nawab's
personal driver, Yadav.
<b>What?</b>
Well, then get him under
our custody immediately.
<b>Sir, we tried to contact him.</b>
<b>But his number is not reachable.</b>
<b>Great!</b>
<b>Another missing link.</b>
Deploy a search team
to find him.
<b>This guy knows something for sure!</b>
<b>Hey, Yadav!</b>
Sir, please, sir.
Let me go.
<b>Nice view, huh?</b>
<b>You know what, Yadav?</b>
This is something important that
humans can learn from
rocket science.
<b>The further the rocket goes up...</b>
it will detach the empty fuel tanks
one by one.
<b>You know why?</b>
<b>Because it's dead weight, my friend!</b>
<b>Unnecessary weight.</b>
When we don't need something anymore,
we must let go of it
immediately.
And now, you look like
dead weight to me, Yadav!
<b>Sir, please don't kill me.</b>
<b>Then prove me wrong, man.</b>
<b>What use are you to me?</b>
I saw him, sir. 
I saw him, sir.
<b>I saw him, sir.</b>
<b>I saw him, sir.</b>
I went to Nellai's house
but only his family was there.
<b>But he abducted Nellai...</b>
<b>I saw the guy who abducted Nellai.</b>
<b>I saw the guy who abducted Nellai.</b>
<b>I have a photo of him.</b>
I have his photo.
I have his photo, sir.
<b>I have a photo of him.</b>
<b>Where?</b>
My phone.
On my phone, sir.
<b>Sir...</b>
<b>Hold still!</b>
<b>Hold still...</b>
Where is it?
- Gallery...
It's the last photo
in the gallery.
<b>Sir, it hurts so bad.</b>
<b>Forward this to all our men.</b>
Tell them to search
every single alley in Kolkata.
Ten crores for the person
who finds him.
<b>I need him.</b>
Sir, please let me go.
It hurts so bad.
<b>Sir...</b>
Careful.
- Okay...
<b>Hurry up.</b>
He is here.
Hurry up.
Have the forensic analysts
examined the crime scene yet?
No, sir. Not yet.
They are on the way.
Sir, these two girls
are Nellai's daughters.
Both of them are doing their
higher education in the US.
Can an ordinary press reporter
give education to his
daughters in the US?
<b>Is it possible?</b>
<b>Not possible, sir.</b>
How many did you say
are there in Nellai's family?
<b>Six members in total.</b>
<b>Him, his wife...</b>
his mother,
his mother-in-law...
<b>And two girls.</b>
<b>That's him.</b>
<b>His wife.</b>
<b>His mother.</b>
<b>His mother-in-law.</b>
<b>His two daughters.</b>
<b>Then who is this boy?</b>
<b>No, that isn't his son.</b>
Fifteen years ago, that kid used to
come to his house
regularly.
<b>He doesn't come here these days.</b>
Ask him if he knows
where their house is.
Go straight, take a left
at the bus stand...
<b>and ask around for Alipur Home.</b>
<b>Be careful.</b>
Don't spread my legs.
The stitches might give away!
Why are you carrying me
like a worthless sack of onions?
<b>Careful!</b>
<b>Sir...</b>
Just take a good close look
and tell us who he is.
I am long sighted.
Move it away from me.
<b>Oh, him...</b>
<b>Do you know him?</b>
<b>Yes...</b>
<b>It's Mathiyazhagan.</b>
<b>Dinesh, don't run!</b>
Hello, madam...
- What?
Stay here.
No one is allowed inside.
<b>But I'm also a part of the team.</b>
<b>Ask Aslan.</b>
No, madam.
I'm sorry.
<b>Stay here.</b>
Anand, he is a prime witness.
Move him to our office
immediately.
<b>Okay, sir.</b>
Hey, Judy. When did you come?
Why didn't you come in?
They didn't let me inside.
- Sir, Yadav is dead.
What?
- Yes, sir.
They shot him dead
at a construction site.
His body is shattered.
We've sent it for post-mortem.
<b>We need to hurry.</b>
Anand, go to the hospital immediately
and collect his
autopsy reports.
No one else should
get hold of it.
No, sir. Let me come with you.
We can send Vishnu...
<b>Anand, please understand.</b>
I can't trust anyone else
with this.
I can only trust you.
Please go.
Judy, let's go.
Come.
<b>Where are we going?</b>
I think I've unearthed the origins
of your genius.
He is right here.
He is following us.
<b>Where are you now?</b>
<b>Howrah Station.</b>
<b>Don't tell anyone else.</b>
Come to the market area.
Let's box him in.
<b>Okay.</b>
Turn left.
Go to the fish market.
<b>Brother, take left.</b>
<b>Mathiyazhagan!</b>
<b>I know him very well.</b>
He is not a student
one forgets so easily.
<b>He was a star!</b>
<b>A genius.</b>
The first state rank holder
from our school.
<b>We can never forget him!</b>
<b>Sister, this genius of yours...</b>
<b>how good was he at maths?</b>
<b>Extraordinary!</b>
He could solve 12th grade math problems
when he was in grade
 5!
He's asked me several times why the school
wouldn't teach
more advanced maths.
The school sponsored him to attend
Olympiads and conferences
 at several countries.
<b>But you know what?</b>
<b>He was not just good at maths.</b>
<b>He was equally good with computers.</b>
When the other kids used to
play games on the computer...
even at that young age,
he used to design advanced computer
games.
<b>Fifteen hours to go!</b>
<b>Fifteen hours to go!</b>
<b>Fifteen hours to go!</b>
<b>I've entered the fish market.</b>
<b>We are here too.</b>
<b>Cover the left side.</b>
Get all our guys on a conference call.
- Okay, boss.
Yes, brother?
- Hello?
<b>Hello?</b>
<b>Where are you?</b>
<b>Where is he?</b>
<b>He is right behind me.</b>
<b>Go this side and look for him.</b>
<b>You, go there.</b>
He shouldn't escape.
Search the entire market.
You think you can beat me up
and escape from here?
There are thousands of men
like me looking for you in
Kolkata.
<b>You can't even leave this area!</b>
<b>Who are you people?</b>
What did you say about me
over the phone?
I showed your photo
on the phone and said...
the guy who kidnapped Nellai
is right here!
You think you can continue to live
after antagonizing Rishi?
<b>Just hand Nellai over to us...</b>
<b>and apologize to Rishi and save your life.</b>
I saw him.
I just saw him.
<b>I saw the guy in the photo.</b>
<b>Are you sure it was him?</b>
It was him!
He ran into the tram godown.
Come to the tram godown.
It's the guy from the photo for
sure!
<b>Everyone, come to the tram godown.</b>
<b>Please try to understand.</b>
Aslan, this isn't about maths
or scoring 100 in the exams!
We are talking about being a prodigy
in two completely
different fields.
<b>Like, totally genius in it.</b>
<b>This isn't even possible!</b>
<b>Just think about it.</b>
This guy has hacked the servers
at the Interpol Headquarters
 and the CBI.
He must be a genius
with computers.
<b>But Cobra is a mathematician for sure!</b>
What if they are
two different people?
And maybe there is
some rift between them?
<b>Shut the gates!</b>
<b>Lock all the doors.</b>
I saw him at the tram godown,
but can't find him now.
<b>We are looking.</b>
He is near the last tram,
running away.
<b>Come to the last tram.</b>
<b>Answer the phone.</b>
<b>I said, answer the phone.</b>
<b>Just do as I say.</b>
No matter what happens here,
you can leave this place alive.
<b>Why are these people chasing me?</b>
Who are they?
- He is right here.
He is on the phone
with someone.
<b>Look for him.</b>
<b>Hello, answer me!</b>
<b>Just listen to me!</b>
<b>Why should I listen to you?</b>
<b>Who are you to me?</b>
<b>Just listen to me!</b>
Take the right
and get out of here.
<b>He ran into the market.</b>
<b>Everyone, go into the market.</b>
Buy an umbrella from
the shop ahead of you.
<b>What for?</b>
<b>Just buy it!</b>
How much?
- 100 rupees.
<b>He is buying an umbrella here.</b>
Box him in from all sides.
Let's see how he escapes from
here!
Did anyone see the colour
of his umbrella?
He has a yellow umbrella
with blue stripes. I saw him!
Don't stop.
Keep walking until I say so.
<b>Tell me atleast now!</b>
Who are these people?
Why are they after me?
Can any of you understand
anything they are saying?
<b>Tell me...</b>
<b>Who are these guys?</b>
They are the goons
of this guy called Rishi.
<b>Oh, Rishi?</b>
<b>Has he found me?</b>
<b>Do you know Rishi?</b>
<b>Answer me!</b>
<b>You know Rishi?</b>
He is on the left side,
near the paan shop.
<b>He is getting away!</b>
This isn't him! See if you can spot
the same colour umbrella
 elsewhere.
We couldn't find
a similar umbrella anywhere else.
How did you get this umbrella?
Answer me!
Some guy gave his umbrella to me...
and took mine...
<b>What colour umbrella did you have?</b>
<b>It's a red umbrella.</b>
It's a red umbrella.
Look for a red umbrella!
Why did you ask me
to swap umbrellas?
<b>Who are you?</b>
<b>Just answer my questions.</b>
<b>Why should Rishi send men to kill you?</b>
<b>What's your rift with Rishi?</b>
<b>He doesn't have an option.</b>
If he doesn't find me and Nellai, 
who I've got with me,
within the next 14 hours...
Rishi and his entire empire
will go down the ground.
<b>You've got Nellai with you?</b>
<b>Capo, they got him!</b>
<b>Yes, tell me?</b>
<b>Sir, we trapped him inside the market.</b>
But someone is coming up with ideas
to save him.
<b>I think they are partners.</b>
I don't care if it's two of them
or two thousand.
<b>I need him alive.</b>
<b>Get it?</b>
<b>I need him alive.</b>
<b>Go back and tell your boss...</b>
<b>tell Rishi that his time is up.</b>
<b>No one can silence Nellai now.</b>
<b>No, don't talk to him!</b>
Who the hell are you
to call time on Rishi Sir?
Let me see how you get out
of this market!
Tell him to add me
to the conference call.
<b>You are making a mistake.</b>
Keeping Nellai with you is like
signing your own death
warrant!
<b>Try to understand.</b>
<b>Tell me where he is.</b>
I'll make sure
he doesn't lay a finger on you.
<b>Dude, seriously?</b>
Do I look like someone
who is scared of these guys?
No matter what happens,
I won't reveal Nellai's location.
<b>Listen to me!</b>
<b>Shut up and listen to me, Mathi!</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
The name of the hacker
who kidnapped Nellai is...
<b>Mathi.</b>
<b>Oh, that?</b>
He was a loafer,
just like me.
But after he met a girl called Jenny,
he eloped with her.
<b>Jenny?</b>
<b>Yes, Jenny.</b>
<b>Her family didn't agree to it.</b>
<b>But her family didn't accept him.</b>
<b>She was the Commissioner's daughter.</b>
<b>They even tried beating him up.</b>
And one fine day,
I heard a loud thud.
<b>It was an accident.</b>
<b>We heard the girl had died in it.</b>
<b>I heard you are scary good at maths!</b>
<b>Mathi Sir...</b>
<b>Just wait and watch...</b>
<b>when you have a problem...</b>
<b>he will be there for you.</b>
<b>Sir, I beg you.</b>
<b>Please don't separate my sons.</b>
<b>Listen to me, lady.</b>
The government will put Mathi up
in a good orphanage.
But we have to send this mad boy
to a psychiatric hospital.
<b>Sir, please don't call him mad.</b>
<b>We don't have the time for this!</b>
Take the mad boy
to the hospital tomorrow.
<b>Don't call him mad!</b>
<b>Don't call him mad!</b>
<b>He has a name.</b>
<b>Kathir!</b>
<b>Ma...</b>
<b>I'll kick you so hard!</b>
You think you are some big shot
because you bombed some cops
 to death?
<b>Lucky for you...</b>
Your mercy petition got rejected,
and you are going to be
hanged tomorrow.
Or we'd have beaten you to
a painful death inside your cell.
<b>Sir, he is crossing the limits.</b>
The whole world knows what the police
do to the women in
their village.
Are all of you police ganging up and labelling
this
perfectly normal boy as crazy...
<b>to get back at this woman?</b>
<b>Perfectly normal boy?</b>
<b>Look at him!</b>
He's gone up the tower
and scribbled all over the walls.
When we ask him a question,
he just does this.
<b>He talks to himself.</b>
What else do we call him,
if not mad?
<b>Sir, I am Kathir's maths teacher.</b>
He is a born prodigy.
A genius.
His IQ is much higher than
other kids of his age.
<b>Please don't call him mad, sir.</b>
<b>Ma, I don't want him.</b>
I can't stand watching you
getting beaten up.
<b>Let him get lost somewhere.</b>
<b>Let him go!</b>
<b>What will he do without you?</b>
<b>Just wait and watch...</b>
<b>when you have a problem...</b>
<b>he will be there for you.</b>
He just doesn't know
how to express his love.
<b>I hope you aren't angry with me.</b>
<b>I didn't say that on purpose.</b>
I said it out of anger
because they hit Ma.
<b>I know, Mathi.</b>
<b>How could you ever hate me?</b>
<b>We share the same blood.</b>
I will never be angry
with you, little one.
<b>Look there, Ma!</b>
<b>Even now, he is talking to himself.</b>
<b>How will he ever be there for me?</b>
Ma, please ask them to hang me
right next to you.
<b>Let me come with you.</b>
Oh, no.
You shouldn't say such things, Mathi.
<b>Both of you should be here.</b>
Both of you will study well and grow up
to become well
respected by everyone.
<b>Put that witch in there.</b>
She is not some freedom fighter
to deserve a 21-gun salute!
<b>Cover her with mud.</b>
<b>Everything is over.</b>
<b>Sit!</b>
<b>Are they going to hang me too?</b>
<b>I am so scared, Kathir!</b>
<b>So scared.</b>
I will never let anything
happen to you, little one.
<b>You will live.</b>
And just like Ma wanted,
you will live a good life.
Listen to me.
It wasn't you who committed the murder.
<b>It was me.</b>
<b>Mathi didn't kill.</b>
<b>It was Kathir.</b>
No matter how the police
question you, just say...
"It was Kathir who killed him
but I don't know where he has
gone."
You've denied him food and water for 20 days 
under the
pretence of an interrogation!
<b>Mathi isn't going to make it.</b>
He refuses to tell us 
where his brother Kathir is.
Doctor, give us a certificate
that he is critical due to
food poisoning.
<b>We will take care of the rest.</b>
What nonsense!
Are you even human?
<b>I'll do anything you ask me for life.</b>
<b>I need the money now.</b>
Nothing should happen to my brother.
- Kathir!
Nothing should happen to my brother.
- Kathir!
The police will put you up
in an orphanage soon.
<b>Another new ticket, huh?</b>
I wonder what antics he did
to end up here!
After that I will come
and be there with you.
<b>As Mathi.</b>
<b>This is the best place for us to hide.</b>
If someone comes into this room,
one of us can hide here.
Both of us will live
under the name of Mathi.
This is Kathir - the sun.
Me.
And that is Mathi - the moon.
You.
Monday is your day.
You can step out.
The next day I will step out
as Mathi.
Let the world never know
what happened to Kathir.
No one else should ever 
know about this.
<b>Swear on me.</b>
<b>Don't you ever break the promise.</b>
No, Kathir.
Please listen to me.
Kathir, don't go.
- Don't break the promise.
How dare you loiter around
in the jail?
How dare you go after
the Commissioner's daughter?
<b>A girl child is a family's property.</b>
<b>A matter of honour.</b>
We can't let her go astray
and watch like bystanders.
<b>I'll kill you!</b>
<b>Die!</b>
I heard you have an older brother
called Kathir?
<b>Who looks exactly like you?</b>
Ten years ago, he killed a cop
and escaped, right?
<b>Did you ever see him again?</b>
<b>Did you?</b>
<b>The case is still open...</b>
I've asked them to dust the case file
and look into it.
You might need to come to the station often
for an enquiry.
<b>Be prepared.</b>
<b>Mathi, I am really sorry.</b>
<b>Did they beat you up real bad?</b>
<b>I swear, I won't spare them.</b>
<b>Sorry, Mathi.</b>
<b>Let's not blow this out of proportion.</b>
I was only being friendly with you,
but they misunderstood
that.
<b>I can understand your parents' fear.</b>
Let's not meet again
or talk to each other.
<b>I am serious.</b>
Let's not meet again
or talk to each other.
<b>You don't get to say that.</b>
<b>Tell him to say that to me.</b>
<b>I don't get it.</b>
<b>You don't get to say that, Kathir.</b>
Tell Mathi to meet me
and say that to me.
<b>He broke it!</b>
<b>He broke it!</b>
He broke your promise
into a million little pieces.
You are the first hero in the world
to save the villain's
life!
<b>Mathi, what the hell have you done?</b>
<b>They called me to the commissioner's house...</b>
gave me your photo,
and asked me to kill you!
You are caught up
in something huge!
<b>They are not ordinary people.</b>
Even if not for me,
they will use someone else to kill you.
Please be honest with me
and tell me the truth....
If you don't,
things would turn tragic.
<b>Mathi!</b>
<b>Mathi!</b>
<b>Mathi, I'm talking to you...</b>
This isn't enough.
Get some more cotton and tincture.
<b>Okay, go and take care of Mathi.</b>
<b>What happened to Mathi?</b>
Jennifer's brother beat up Mathi
with some men.
<b>What are you saying!</b>
<b>Thanks, you guys should go.</b>
I can take care of myself.
- Come on! How?
I'm fine.
I can take care of myself.
<b>Go.</b>
We are right here.
Let us know if you need something.
<b>Okay.</b>
<b>Careful!</b>
<b>Did they hit you, little one?</b>
<b>I'm sorry, Kathir.</b>
Why are you saying
sorry, little one?
<b>It was a mistake.</b>
<b>They thought you were me...</b>
<b>Did they say anything else?</b>
<b>Her father dug up our old case details.</b>
<b>Oh?</b>
<b>Is he threatening us?</b>
<b>What did he say?</b>
<b>That he'd put me on a noose?</b>
They can never separate us,
no matter how hard they try.
<b>Little one, have you thought this through?</b>
Do you really need the girl
after all of this?
<b>You don't need her.</b>
<b>Kathir, this isn't just some girl.</b>
<b>She is my angel.</b>
<b>Not everyone ends up with an angel.</b>
Have you ever seen me smile
in all these years?
<b>But I smile these days.</b>
<b>I finally know what happiness means.</b>
I feel like I've regained everything
I lost in life.
<b>I feel like I've got Ma back.</b>
<b>Not everyone can become Ma, little one.</b>
<b>The girl doesn't have patience.</b>
<b>Do you know what she told her father?</b>
<b>She will lead us to big trouble, little one.</b>
<b>Are you scared?</b>
Are you scared our secret will be exposed
and we'd get
caught?
<b>I won't get you into trouble.</b>
I am going to leave the city with her
in a few days.
<b>You can be Mathi all the time.</b>
<b>Are you going to leave me, little one?</b>
Has she become more important
to you than me?
<b>Fine...</b>
<b>Where will you go?</b>
<b>Those aren't ordinary guys.</b>
They will hunt you down
and kill you.
<b>I just want to be with my Jenny.</b>
<b>I am ready to sacrifice my life for it.</b>
<b>You'd sacrifice your life for her?</b>
As long as I am alive, I won't allow
a single scratch on
your body.
I'd go to any extent
to protect you.
If killing the girl is what
it would take to save you...
<b>I am ready for that too.</b>
<b>If you dare say another word...</b>
<b>I'd put an end to you.</b>
<b>You'd kill her?</b>
<b>If you even think about it again...</b>
<b>I'll kill you.</b>
Jenny?
- Mathi...
Mathi...
- Jenny?
Someone is chasing me.
- What are you saying?
<b>They are chasing me.</b>
Mathi...
- Who?
<b>Where are you?</b>
<b>Who?</b>
<b>Jenny...</b>
<b>Kathir!</b>
<b>Jenny?</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Jenny?</b>
<b>Jenny...</b>
<b>Jenny!</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Mathi!</b>
Mathi, I am scared.
You should--
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Mathi, please hear me out.</b>
Mathi...
- Who is Mathi?
<b>Me?</b>
<b>But you are Mathi, aren't you?</b>
<b>Isn't that why you killed her?</b>
<b>Are you puzzled how I made it out alive...</b>
after you threw me into the ship
to rot with the filth in
the ocean?
I am destined to be the reason
why you get caught and
eventually die.
<b>That's why God saved me.</b>
<b>The ship that you threw me in...</b>
it crossed borders and got caught
by the Thailand coast
guards.
<b>I was in jail for 10 years.</b>
<b>It was hell.</b>
<b>I escaped from the jail in Thailand.</b>
<b>I was scared to go anywhere.</b>
I was scared that
someone would identify me.
<b>But above all...</b>
I was filled with rage to find you after you escaped
from
Kolkata without leaving any trail behind.
I installed cameras
in all the places frequented by Nellai.
<b>I tapped his phone.</b>
I watched every single move of his
and passed that
information to Interpol.
I was hoping atleast
they'd be able to catch you...
<b>but you always got away.</b>
I went mad trying to
crack your Su-Do-Ku code.
<b>Then I kidnapped Nellai.</b>
And I used him to send you
the Su-Do-Ku code I wanted.
You walked right into it,
like a rat into a trap!
<b>That moment...</b>
<b>I was so happy.</b>
When I admitted you here,
they asked for your details.
<b>I said I didn't know.</b>
They said they'd have to inform
the police, as per
procedure.
<b>I said okay.</b>
I heard the police know the assassin
who killed people
across the world is you...
I mean the police know it's Mathi, and they are
looking for
you everywhere to arrest you.
No, Mathi.
Listen to me...
<b>You wanted to be Mathi, didn't you?</b>
<b>So be Mathi!</b>
<b>No, Mathi.</b>
Sir, the accused we were looking for
is in the hospital.
I'll arrest him
and bring him immediately.
<b>Sir, we have arrested him.</b>
<b>We will reach in half an hour.</b>
There is no need
for additional forces, sir.
Don't worry, sir.
We are on our way.
<b>How did the press get here?</b>
Hello, sir? I've sent you a photo.
Please take a look
immediately.
His name is Mathiyazhagan.
He is a maths teacher.
I've been following
Aslan's investigation thoroughly.
I am 100 percent sure
he is the assassin who worked for you.
Show him the photo
we got from Yadav.
<b>They are not just two people.</b>
<b>They are two identical looking people.</b>
<b>I don't care who Mathiyazhagan is.</b>
<b>I don't want Aslan to investigate him.</b>
I'm coming over.
- Sir, let me take care of it!
I'll try to somehow shift him out
of this case by tonight.
<b>I'll keep you informed.</b>
<b>Anand...</b>
<b>If something goes wrong...</b>
I will make sure there is no evidence
of a person called
Anand having existed on this earth.
Sir, I assure you he won't
open his mouth.
<b>I'll take care of it.</b>
But I need you to talk to the Home Minister
to grant me full
 control of this case.
I'll take care of it.
I'll call you back.
<b>Lift him up!</b>
<b>Thought you could mess with us?</b>
What do you mean 'duty'?
- Answer me, sir.
<b>Sister...</b>
There is no way anything they said
is true at all.
<b>Let me go.</b>
<b>I'll come back with him.</b>
<b>I don't find it right, general.</b>
<b>I've been observing certain things here.</b>
<b>The evidences were tampered.</b>
And I am damn sure
Rishi is behind this.
We need to get the custody of Mathiyazhagan
as soon as
possible.
Or all our hard work
will go to waste.
<b>Thought you could mess with us?</b>
<b>Ma'am...</b>
<b>You've made a mistake, Judy.</b>
<b>A big big mistake.</b>
No, ma'am.
I've done you a favour.
I might be a big fan
of his mathematics.
But what he committed
was a big crime.
He will never be able to
get away with it.
<b>Think about it, ma'am...</b>
<b>I've done you a favour.</b>
<b>Ma'am...</b>
I'm not hitting you
to get you to talk.
I am hitting you
so you never talk at all.
<b>If you open your mouth...</b>
the guy outside who looks
exactly like you...
he will die in a more brutal way
than you can ever imagine.
<b>Rishi is watching everything.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Do you understand?</b>
<b>How dare you laugh!</b>
<b>Don't mess with me, you rascal!</b>
<b>Do you even call this an investigation?</b>
<b>What are you even doing?</b>
You will have to handover the suspect
to me within three
days.
If something happens to him,
I'll take this to the
international court.
<b>Vishnu...</b>
Tell Anand to come here.
- Sure, sir.
<b>Anand, stop this.</b>
<b>Lower him immediately.</b>
<b>What?</b>
<b>Why should I stop questioning him?</b>
If you want him to talk within a day,
this is the only way.
Is that so, sir?
By gagging him?
You expect him to
talk through his ears?
Anand, I can definitely sense
something wrong with you.
Oh?
Nice!
Stop it! Bring him down and get him
to the interrogation
room.
You haven't even allowed me to use
the bathroom, like I'm
some criminal.
<b>This is torture, sir.</b>
We got engaged yesterday.
- You live with him, right?
We were supposed to
get married today.
<b>Why didn't the wedding happen?</b>
<b>I have already answered that.</b>
You need to answer it
every time we ask you, madam.
<b>I will answer if you ask me respectfully.</b>
<b>Just answer the damn question!</b>
You were about to marry a criminal
without knowing his
background....
<b>you don't deserve any respect!</b>
Why should he raise someone like you,
who was born to a
ganja peddler and an immoral woman?
Cut the act and stop crying.
Answer me.
You live in the house, don't you?
- Please let me go.
What would be running inside
that genius brain of his?
Your time is running out
way too fast.
Things are going to get
even worse for you.
<b>What wrong did they do?</b>
<b>Why should they suffer?</b>
<b>What is wrong with you?</b>
<b>What the hell is wrong with you?</b>
<b>He is the real problem.</b>
<b>This little punk is our problem.</b>
<b>Blood is thicker than water.</b>
<b>That's the real matter.</b>
<b>Emotion.</b>
<b>Affection.</b>
<b>Gopal...</b>
Lose it, man.
Lose it.
<b>Get lost, you loser!</b>
<b>Emotions have no value.</b>
They are neither scalar nor vector
nor can be measured!
The only difference between
a genius and a fool is...
<b>emotional decisions.</b>
Teacher, it doesn't matter if you
talk in length in a husky
voice...
<b>or if you swear at him!</b>
Nothing will get past
his thick skull!
<b>There he goes again!</b>
<b>Yes, that is how my son is.</b>
<b>I raised him that way.</b>
If Mathi is in trouble,
he will be there for him.
<b>All of you have changed him.</b>
Oh yes,
we changed him.
It was us,
we changed him!
We changed him, we changed him,
we changed him.
We changed him, we changed him,
we changed him.
<b>What the hell!</b>
<b>Why are you feeling sorry for her?</b>
She is responsible for everything
that happened to you.
<b>She deserved to die.</b>
It is not your fault
that she died.
<b>Grab the stick!</b>
Oh, yes.
It wasn't his fault.
<b>Then why is she chasing him?</b>
<b>Why is she taking revenge on him?</b>
<b>Exactly the point!</b>
<b>He is being a showoff, My Lord!</b>
<b>Kill him!</b>
<b>You can do it.</b>
<b>Even at this moment...</b>
you are a freaking genius with numbers
in every goddamn cell
 of your body.
<b>Who?</b>
If you speak up and confess,
we can atleast save them.
<b>Are you going to speak up or not?</b>
How much longer
are you going to remain silent?
<b>What do we look like to you?</b>
<b>You look like losers!</b>
<b>Go for it, Kathir!</b>
You know what they'd do
to Mathi if they catch him.
<b>Rishi will kill Mathi anyway.</b>
What's the point
if both Mathi and you die?
You know how to save yourself
with minimal loss.
<b>Game theory!</b>
<b>Just apply it!</b>
<b>To hell with your apples.</b>
Go away, he isn't going to
listen to you.
<b>You shut up!</b>
<b>Kathir, please listen to me.</b>
Mathematics is not for fools like you.
Don't keep saying the
 same thing.
He isn't going to listen to you.
Just shut the crap.
<b>Shut up, man.</b>
<b>Shut up, man</b>
Won't you listen to me?
- Genius...
<b>Be quiet, all of you.</b>
Not a word of what he says
should go into your brain.
<b>This is absolute shit!</b>
<b>Shut up and listen to me.</b>
<b>Open your mouth and speak up!</b>
We know you did all of it.
Just confess.
You are asking me to confess
to someone else's crimes, sir!
<b>Wait, what are you saying?</b>
<b>Aren't you Mathi?</b>
<b>The maths teacher?</b>
<b>Sir, I am Mathi.</b>
<b>I am the maths teacher too.</b>
<b>But I didn't do it.</b>
I have absolutely nothing
to do with any of this!
<b>I have an older brother, sir.</b>
<b>Kathir.</b>
<b>What's this new story?</b>
Sir, look up the Kolkata Jail records
from 1985.
<b>Check the jail records.</b>
Verify it immediately
and get back to me.
<b>Quick!</b>
<b>Sir, there are two of them.</b>
<b>Kathirvelan and Mathiyazhagan.</b>
The official reports
are on their way, sir.
<b>I am just an average student, sir.</b>
<b>But he is a genius.</b>
<b>He is very different, sir.</b>
<b>He doesn't talk to anyone, sir.</b>
In 1992, Dr. Sheetal was
the juvenile doctor.
<b>Dr. Sheetal knows.</b>
<b>She knows him very well.</b>
<b>That psycho...</b>
Hurry up.
- Okay, sir.
Kathir?
I remember.
<b>He was a special child.</b>
<b>A maths prodigy.</b>
During our mother's final rites,
an inspector behaved so
disrespectfully.
<b>Debashish Chatterjee.</b>
<b>He killed him on the spot.</b>
<b>Killed him!</b>
<b>This guy called Nellai...</b>
Even though I was a total stranger,
he wanted to educate me.
So I happily listened to everything he said
and started
attending school.
After a few months I got to know
that him and Kathir were
doing some illegal activities.
And that they were using me as a cover
in case things went
wrong during their illegal activities.
He came to see me
at the hospital last night.
That was when I found out
that he's dragged me into this big
 mess.
<b>I am just an ordinary maths teacher.</b>
<b>Sir!</b>
Sir, I'm just an ordinary
maths teacher.
Sir, I have nothing to do
with any of this.
<b>Sir, please...</b>
Brother!
Hello?
<b>Sir...</b>
Sir, what do we do now?
- He is not our problem, Anand.
It's the hacker on the outside
who is our problem.
<b>Stop!</b>
So he is the guy who was
helping us all along.
The guy who tied Mathi up
and made him surrender to the
police.
<b>But no worries.</b>
<b>We don't have to do anything.</b>
The math guy would have
done the math by now.
<b>Sir, how do you know that?</b>
<b>Do you still not get it?</b>
He plugged all the loopholes
and erased his name everywhere.
<b>The guy you mentioned does exist.</b>
<b>But only in records.</b>
His only complication right now is that
Nellai shouldn't
blurt the truth out.
<b>He knows the clock is ticking too.</b>
This guy and Nellai are very important
for us to close this
case.
We should make sure things don't escalate
and no one ends up
 harming him.
<b>Just talk to him like I told you to.</b>
<b>You know him really well.</b>
We can trap him
only with you.
If you help us,
we won't disturb you.
He won't be alive
to disturb you either.
<b>This is your only option.</b>
<b>He will lead us to the clown guy.</b>
<b>I will help you, sir.</b>
Just do as I say.
He will surely fall for it.
But promise me that no harm
will befall me or my family.
<b>I'll kill both of them together.</b>
Circulate this photo to all police stations,
railway
stations, toll gates, bus stands etc.
<b>Mainly West Kolkata...</b>
tell them to conduct a thorough search
around the tram
godown area.
<b>What if he doesn't step out?</b>
<b>He shouldn't step out.</b>
Even if he does, he should return
because he can't go
anywhere.
Because we can trap him
only inside his own place.
<b>I don't get it.</b>
I'm saying it is very easy to find out
where he's been
hiding all these days.
<b>How is that?</b>
<b>By his power and internet consumption.</b>
Hacking into Russia's Defence headquarters
is no ordinary
feat.
It requires a lot of data centres
and servers.
<b>It uses a lot of electricity and data.</b>
The Russian hack happened on Dec 27th,
at exactly 7:40 in
the evening.
<b>The time in India was 10:10 pm.</b>
If we make a list of the top 200 locations that
consumed
maximum power and internet during that date and
time...
<b>finding his location will be...</b>
<b>really easy.</b>
<b>You can go.</b>
<b>It's him!</b>
Catch him.
Hurry up!
Sir, there are 29 locations
that are common across these two
 lists.
Out of which 28 are IT parks,
and the other one is a mall.
<b>A mall?</b>
Which mall?
- Howrah Grand Mall.
<b>Howrah Grand Mall?</b>
But hasn't it been under renovation
for the last 1.5 years?
Moreover, they don't have permission
to do renovation work
during the nights.
Did you check properly?
- We did a thorough check, sir.
<b>Which area is the mall in?</b>
<b>Sir, I think we need backup.</b>
We should call for our forces
and bring this area under our
control.
They have already brought
this area under control, sir.
<b>What are you saying?</b>
Didn't you notice the
fresh tyre marks outside, sir?
Based on the turning radius,
I'd say 1 sedan, 3 SUVs, and 2
trucks.
Some 20-25 men have already
got here before us, sir.
You think they wouldn't have
brought the area under control,
 sir?
<b>Wow, wow, wow!</b>
Didn't I tell you
our guy is really talented?
<b>Who are you guys?</b>
You are pointing the gun
at the wrong guy, officer.
Two more seconds and I'm going to get
seriously offended.
Sir, call for backup.
- Drop the gun, Mr. Vishnu.
<b>Sir, call for backup.</b>
<b>Please drop your gun, Vishnu!</b>
<b>Sir...</b>
<b>Kathirvelan!</b>
<b>My best weapon.</b>
<b>I should actually be thanking you.</b>
<b>But thanks to what you did...</b>
you've put me in a situation
where I have to kill both of
you.
<b>All I can say now is...</b>
<b>sorry.</b>
<b>Sir...</b>
you don't have to say
sorry to me!
<b>You won't kill me, sir.</b>
<b>You can't kill me.</b>
<b>Oh, yeah?</b>
<b>Yes, sir.</b>
<b>I feel like...</b>
I might end up
harming you.
<b>Anand...</b>
<b>relax!</b>
<b>Anand...</b>
<b>relax!</b>
Sir, do you know what
an angel number is?
<b>1111, 2222...</b>
When we see such numbers,
anything we wish for will come
true.
<b>You've done a lot for me, sir.</b>
<b>Make one final wish, sir.</b>
In exactly 1-1-1-1-,
that is 11 minutes and 11 seconds...
<b>you...</b>
<b>and all these guys too...</b>
<b>will be killed by me!</b>
Do you have any idea
what you are saying?
<b>Do you get it, sir?</b>
<b>I do, sir.</b>
<b>This is fun.</b>
<b>So, 1-1-1-1.</b>
<b>11 minutes and 11 seconds?</b>
<b>Let's play this game.</b>
Let's see who wins.
You or me?
<b>You are making a big mistake, officer.</b>
He is a prime suspect, goddamn it.
Just tell me where the
hell he is.
Seriously? Fine, I will be
waiting right here.
If you don't hand him over to me
within the next two
hours...
I promise you there will be
severe consequences.
<b>Aslan...</b>
it was me who gave you 
those tipoffs all along.
I don't know if I'd still be alive
in some time.
The only way you can close your case
is with Nellai's
statement.
He will start blurting everything out
in exactly 30 minutes.
Kathir, Rishi, and all his men
are right here.
<b>Get here as fast as you can.</b>
<b>I've shared the location.</b>
<b>This is my last favour to you.</b>
<b>Don't spare him.</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
Did we catch both the rats
in a single trap?
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>What are you guys doing in there?</b>
<b>Come out!</b>
<b>Come at me!</b>
<b>Come on, guys!</b>
<b>You've only got three more minutes.</b>
<b>Fine!</b>
<b>Okay...</b>
You've done a lot for me.
It's just three more minutes.
<b>I will wait here.</b>
<b>Did you hear that?</b>
<b>Heard that?</b>
<b>You are the reason for all of this!</b>
I am happy to die
at your hands.
<b>I swear...</b>
<b>I didn't kill her.</b>
<b>I swear...</b>
<b>I was the one who called Jennifer.</b>
<b>Hear me out.</b>
<b>The problem has become serious.</b>
Both of you need to
get out of here immediately.
I've made all the arrangements
for you to go to Bangladesh
safely.
No one will be able
to find you.
<b>He is furious with me.</b>
I don't even know
if he'd believe me.
<b>I just want him to be safe.</b>
<b>Nothing else.</b>
<b>I hope no one saw you.</b>
<b>I just told my little sister.</b>
I don't even know if I'd ever
see her again.
<b>She has no one but for me.</b>
<b>Mathi!</b>
<b>Mathi...</b>
<b>Jenny...</b>
<b>Why are you crying now?</b>
Rather than being alive
and tarnishing our family honour...
<b>I am glad she died.</b>
Report this as an accident
and close the case!
And throw this mongrel's corpse
with other filth into the
sea.
I couldn't do anything
so I was...
<b>filled with anger and rage.</b>
<b>The people who killed you were...</b>
<b>happy...</b>
<b>I couldn't take it, little one.</b>
<b>I didn't spare any of them.</b>
<b>Not a single one.</b>
To my heart's content,
I went after them.
<b>Ever since I heard what happened to you...</b>
There is a beautiful life
waiting for you out there.
<b>Mathi...</b>
is a good teacher.
Everyone likes him.
Remember what Ma told us?
It's such a good life.
<b>What are you saying, Kathir?</b>
<b>It's called game theory, man.</b>
A mathematician knows how to
get away with minimal loss.
<b>That is...</b>
instead of losing two lives,
you are trying to save atleast
one...
<b>so you are taking revenge!</b>
That's superb.
First class!
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Kathir...</b>
<b>Who were you--</b>
<b>Oh...</b>
<b>You don't know that, do you?</b>
<b>Even as a kid, I had headaches.</b>
It felt like a machine was running
inside my head.
<b>It hurt so bad.</b>
<b>These people used to come to me.</b>
<b>And offer me a lot of advice.</b>
<b>You used to come, too.</b>
You used to smile
when you talked to me.
<b>This is called a hallucination.</b>
They say it can be cured
with treatment.
This was the only way
I could talk to you.
<b>But without it...</b>
<b>how would I survive?</b>
<b>So I didn't undergo treatment.</b>
<b>Time's up!</b>
Please wait. Aslan will be here shortly,
he will take care
of everything.
<b>Kathir, don't...</b>
If you step out of the door,
you won't survive.
<b>If something happens to you...</b>
I can't get away with the crimes
I've committed.
Rishi will never let us live
as long as he is around.
<b>One person should take all the blame.</b>
<b>You are Mathi now.</b>
<b>Continue being Mathi.</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
Attaboy!
Let's leave.
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Come on!</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Shoot him!</b>
<b>Yeah!</b>
<b>My little brother...</b>
<b>poor guy.</b>
<b>It was me...</b>
<b>but he...</b>
<b>Nothing should happen to him.</b>
<b>I don't care what happens to me.</b>
<b>Look what I've done to his life...</b>
<b>He...</b>
<b>He should live.</b>
<b>Sorry.</b>
<b>Thank you, Mathi.</b>
<b>I might be Mathi.</b>
<b>When everyone calls me now...</b>
I might hear the name 'Mathi'
millions of times.
But the only name that will be
running in my mind is...
<b>Kathir.</b>
<b>Kathir!</b>
<b>Kathir...</b>
Kathir, no matter where you are,
I know you are watching
over me.
I know if I am in trouble,
you will be there for me.
<b>I know you'd do anything for me.</b>
<b>Can you do one last thing for me?</b>
<b>If there is a next life...</b>
<b>will you be my sibling again, Kathir?</b>
<b>Please?</b>
