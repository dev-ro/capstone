We are not names to them.
No, no, look. Answer me this. Answer

W-Well, because I-I-I want another
title shot, and I got a better chance--
Yeah, right. And middleweight's

That's why I dropped down.

How is that possible?.
- Hey, would you relax?.
This is the art
of negotiation.
- The art of negotiation.

What does it matter?.
These guys'll fill the hour anyway.
As long as Cesar doesn't
do a Garden number on us.
Vince has never been stopped.
Whoever wins, we'll feed him
to the middleweight champ,
and he'll eat him
like raw meat.
'Course We'dhave to get them ranked,
uh, for the title shot, but--
I-I don't see a problem.
We set aside 750,000
for Rosario and Green.
We saved ourself a bundle.
Hell, I could get Julie here
ranked with a phone call.
Julie's already ranked,
in my opinion.
- Thankyou.
- Hit the goddamn button.

You're smart guys.
I like smart guys. You got it.

Okay, okay, look. It's gotta say in
the contract "guaranteed title shot."

Anda translation in Spanish
for, uh, technical reasons.
Yeah. Right. And,Joe, don't mess

"The Wickedshall fall by his oWn
Wickedness. " Proverbs 1 1:5. Okay?

[ Grace ] There's a lot ofmoney

I 'm gonna look for some venture
capital guys might wanna back me.
Still tryin' to raise money
for that dumb invention?.
I have six patents
and six patents pending,
one ofwhich, may I remind you, made me
enough dough to buy my apartment house.
And we appreciateyou takin' us
to Vegas. Thankyou, baby.
No problem. Vegas is the fastest
growing city in America, and--
You know I got
people skills, so--
Oh, yeah, you got such good people
skills, how comeyou can't keep a man?.
Honey, it's the men
that can't keep me.
Uh, I am keeping you,
sweetheart.
We'll see.
You knoW, I think this trip is
gonna be a good chance for me...
to try out my new system
on the roulette wheel.
That's not a good idea,
Vince, the roulette wheel.
This is a good idea. You got--
You got black, you got red.
It's about a fifty-fifty shot.
And then ifyou--
Where-- Where we goin'?.
The geology's much prettier out here.
You can see the striations...
- in the Calico Mountains.
- Fuck the striations!
- We gotta get to Vegas!
- What is-- What is that idea you got...
- about the roulette Wheel,
What is that?
- Oh, okay, okay.
You got red. You got black.
Okay, there's a ffty-ffty chance.
You miss a bet,
you double up.
I t's fool proof.
Key word: fool.
Grace, can you tell me again,
Why-- Why are We in this road?
- Striations.
- Striations.
Striations.
Jesus Christ.
Uh... dear Lord,
I said your name in vain.
I-- I-I fucked--
I messed up.
I-- Uh, I Won't
do it again. Amen.
Very cool.
They're in...
a fucking car?.
Apparently, yes.
Vince once had 1 4 car wrecks
in 1 4 months.
Well,Johnny said
they're with Grace, in her car.
Uh, Vince don't even have
a license no more.
Grace! Grace. That Wouldn't be
Grace Pasic, Wouldit?
- Yeah.
- She's still with Vince?.
That's amazing.
- No, actually she's with Cesar now.
- I'll be a son ofa bitch!
That chick always had a thing
for middleweights, huh?.
[ Laughing ] Hey, Bobby, Sal.
Go draw up the usual contracts.
Cesar, we need to talk.
Baby, I am not going anyWhere.
Let's talk.
- I think it's over.
- Eh-- Wh-What?.
I think it's over
between us.
Wh-- Hey, baby,
what do you mean?.
Well, let's face it.
It was a fling.
- Nothing more.
- No, no. I-It wasn't a fling to me.
It was a fling that could've developed
into something, but didn't.
Shit.
W-We arejust getting started.
No. We'rejust
wrapping it up.
Don't I have anything
to say in this?.
No.
Baby-- Baby, I loveyou.
Come on. You are the only one.
You are the one...
a-a-and only.
Don't grovel.
No groveling.
- Is this final?.
- Well, nothing's ever final.
I said I think it's over.
I didn't say I feel it's over,
- which would have been a much
more serious problem foryou.
- Much more serious.
But when the thoughts
and feelings start swirling around,
you gotta pay attention.
You knoW?
Besides,you--
You don't love me.
But I-- I'm getting there. You know,
step by step, little by little.
Honey. It's too late.
[Laughing]
?? [Blues ]
? Oh, Why ?
? Baby, Why areyou
so mean to me ?
[ Crying ]
- Cesar?.
- ? Oh, Why ?
? Why areyou so mean to me ?
Pull over.
? I tried to make you happy
little girl ?
? I Was as nice to you
as any man could be ?
[ Vince Sobbing ]
[ Speaki ng Angri ly
I n Spanish ]
[ Continues ]
I s it something I said?.
Oh, no, no.
That has nothing to do with you.
He always cries
the day of a fight.
- [ Spanish Continues ]
- Oh! Huh.
[TrainApproaching]
He's fine.
So what happened to him
in the Garden?.
Well, that's up for him
to tell ya.
But, uh, I don't think
he wants to talk about it.
[ Muttering Quietly]
[ Exhales ]
I don't know
ifl can fight him.
You know, I'm afraid I'm gonna freeze up
and pull my punches. You know?.
We're tight. It's like--
Uh, the worst thing you wanna
feel in the ring is compassion.
Vince, all you need
is the bell.
Aah, it feels
unnatural.
[ Kiss ]
[ Kiss ]
Let's go.
Come on.
We've draWn up neW contracts
on Boudreau and Dominguez.
Wanna check them out?.
Uh, you sure you want to guarantee
a middleweight title shot
to one of these bums?.
I promised 'em,
if that means anything.
Well, We fgured! So, uh,
We dreW up tWo sets ofpapers.
One of'em uses language
we can get out of ifwe wanna.
The other one also has language
We can get out ofifWe Want,
but, uh, it's less obvious.
We figure they'll reject one
and accept the other.
- They're happy. We're happy.
- Fine.
Hank, get our name fighters...
some legal.
Dante, is your license
still good?.
- Uh, it was recently reinstated.
- Good.
You are now the attorney for
Vince Boudreau and Cesar Dominguez.
Well, uh, what's my fee?.
We don't report you to the
state bar forjury tampering,
extortion, paying off
state senators,
sexual harassment,
land fraud--
- Fair enough, fair enough.
- That's a good deal.
I'll be more than happy to represent
these two fineyoung men.
So when did this
Jesus thing start?.
Aw, you know,
I was raised religious.
Sunday school, Bible study,
guilt, the whole bit.
It didn't take long to realize that, uh,
church was misrepresentin'Jesus,
'causeJesus Was allabout
notjudging...
and theywere judging
everybody.
So as soon as I figured out
that the church was a bunch
ofhypocrites, I, uh--
I started focusing
on having fun.
So, you know,
I partied, had--
had a couple girls,
had a couple wrecks.
- A couple?.
- Well, a couple dozen.
I Was Wild.
This Was around the time I metyou.
Yeah.
We hada good run ofit,
didn't We?
We were pretty crazy.
Yeah. Uh, well,
right afteryou left me,
I, uh, ran into a tree
going 75.
I was so wasted I don't remember
a thing till I was layin' on my back...
in a pool
ofblood and gasoline...
with the car
restin' on my head.
And I figured it's my time.
But then I look up, and who do I see?.
Jesus. And He's unmistakable.
Right?.
And He's-- He's lookin' down
on me, and He's smilin'...
Iike everything's okay.
Andthen He liftedthe car
offmyhead.
- Yeah.
- Wow.
It was. You know,
I see Him from time to time.
What's He look like?.
Uh,just like in the pictures.
Same deal.
Well, ifyou see Him sometime,
would you point Him out to me?.
Oh, yeah. Sure.
Huh.
You believe in that, don'tyou?.
Thewhole battle between good and evil.
Sometimes.
Sometimes
I'm not in the mood.
Sometimes I'm in the mood
for a warm bath, fresh robe.
Glass ofwine.
To be left alone.
- I love church music.
- Church music.
It's too goodfor the church.Jesus Was
too good for the church,you ask me.
You knoW, He shook things up.
He Was, uh--
He was a anarchist, you know?.
And He, uh--
You know He threw the money
lenders outta the temple.
First thing He's gonna do when
He comes back is torch the Vatican.
Vince! Come on.
Aw, whatever.
Sometimes I miss you, Vince.
Sometimes I miss you.
You know, my mom died.
No, I didn't.
I'm sorry.
She liked you the best
of all my boyfriends.
Butyou didn't.
I'm lookin' for something else.
I don't know what.
The right man?.
[ Laughs ]
The right career?.
The right circumstance.
I don't know.
But I'm lookin' for something.
Maybeyou're lookin'
forJesus.
[ Laughs ]
No. I am not looking forJesus.
I'm lookin' for money.
One! TWo!

I love all Mexicans.
I love Mexicans too,
but I am a Spaniard.
You speak Mexican, right?.
No, Mexicans speak
Spanish from Spain.
- You from Madrid?.
- Yeah.
And Madrid is in Mexico,
right?. Right?.
- [ Laughing ]
- Sure. Yeah.
And besides-- You know, I understand
Mexicans are our neighbors,
but what the hell did Spanish people
ever do to deserve to be
in this country?.
We-- We discovered
this land.
- Italians discovered it.
- And who paid for-- for the trip?.
- Doyou haveyour green card?.
- Of course I have my green card!

What did you want to do
in Las Vegas, alone?.
I can take care

Hey, I am not a dirty fighter.

It's not dirty to elbow

Y-You're leaving me and you're
asking me something like that?.
Well, I'm curious.
I wanna know.
All right, fine. Don't tell me about
the Garden. I'm not gonna askyou again.
[ Sighs ] You know, therewere
not enough tough fights in Europe.
The boxing environment,
there Was almost none.
That's why I moved
from Madrid to Philadelphia,
because the best fighters in
the whole world are from Philadelphia.
I mean, ifthere is two guys you've
never heard offighting each other...
and one ofthem is from there--
[ Chuckles ]
You bet on him.
Isn't it right?.
- Ah, that's true.
- So, I Was 23years old.
- I was 1 9 and 0 and 1 6 knockouts.
- WoW.
And I had the best management.
I had the Duvas in my corner.
I was on the cover of Ring magazine.
Remember?.
True.
And-- And this motherfucker...
Joe Domino came calling.
Ah, he was one ofthe biggest
promoters of all ofthem.
And, uh, now he said to me that if
I left the Duvas and signed with him,
he would give me a title shot
in Madison Square Garden.
NewYork. You--
You imaginewhat that means!
- YouknoW?
- Right.
The-- The Duvas
Were prettyupset.
They-- They said that
I was a couple ofyears away,
that I needed more experience,
and they were probably right,
but...
I broke from the Duvas
and signed with Domino.
I was ready.
[ Chuckles ]
In the red corner,
the challenger,
with a record of 1 9 wins
and no losses,
sixteen byknockout,
from Philadelphia
by Way ofMadrid, Spain,
Cesar "El Califa " Dominguez!
Dominguez!
[ Laughs ]
The guy i n the Garden,
after he says your name,
he says it again.
He says, " Dominguez.
Do-o-o-min-guez!"
- Oh, my God.
- Dominguez!
It Was so cool
just to hearyourname so big.
You know, in front of so many
people. Oh, my God, so good.
So good. You know, the champion
didn't look like much.
[Announcer]
Roberto Velario!
And I didn't care, you know?.
I was ready.
I beat tougher guys
in Philadelphia.
All right, touch 'em up.
All right, good luck.
Cesar, listen. This next 36 minutes
is gonna change the rest ofyour life.
Ifyou've ever listened, you listen now.
You understand that?.
- Yeah, yeah.
- We prepared for this.
This guy is older than you.
He's not as young as you.
He can't stay 1 2 rounds.
But one thing he can do is
he can think, and he can setyou up.
He's gonna come out. He's gonna
throw a few jabs atya.
He's gonna shoot a right hand in front
ofya. It's a fake right hand.
That's not the danger.
The left hook is the danger.
Don't let him moveyou back toyour
right. Don't! Not even for a second.
Because ifyou do, it's gonna
be over. Doyou understand that?.
- Go out there now,
and let's get a title!
- Yeah. Yeah. Come on, come on.
- Let's go, let's go! Come on.
- [Bell Dings ]
[ Cesar]
So the champion comes out, and then...
I start circling
to my left, uh,just, uh,
keeping my left foot
outside his right foot.
And just I i ke the guy said,
you know, he just fi res a jab.
Nothing. And anotherjab.
Nothing.
And another one. Nothing.
And then a straight right hand.
And I slip it, and-- and here he comes.
You know, the left hook.
Andjust like the guysaid, nothing.
Hit myshoulder. PoWderpuff.
- Powder puff.
- PoWderpuff! Nothing on it.
You can hit harder.
I n fact, you have hit harder.
[ Clears Throat ]
Don't go there.
Amen.
So I continue circling
a bit, you know,
sizing him up now,
uh--
You gotta understand something
about this guy, Velario. [ Chuckles ]
He's got a sweet face.
He's like--
A little smile, almost,
you know, when he's out there.
So another couple ofjabs,
just little flicks, don't do nothing,
and I stop circling for, I don't
knoW, a millionth ofa second.
Yeah. Here it comes.
A straight right hand.
But, oops, the guy did a movement
like this, you know, and pulls it back.
A-And that's it. That's the feinted
overhand right my guy told me about.
And I am thinking at that point--
I am thinking.
Because sometimes in the ring,
all time stops and--
and you can think.
You cansee everything
sloWmotion and--
And time stops.
And I-- And I am thinking,
[ Chuckles ] "This guy--
This guy ain't got shit." You know?.
And then I'm thinking the other
thing my guy told me, you know.
That it's over.
[ Punch Landing ]
That it's over. You know.
Cesar, get up!
Get up! Get up,
you Mexican motherfucker! Get up!
I picked up the count at five,
a-and I got to one knee,
and I'll get up at eight or nine,
you know, get through the round.
And I thought I got up
at nine.
- [Referee ]Six! Seven!
- Cesar, get the fuck up!
Eight! Nine! Ten!
- You're out.
- [Domino ] You're a piece ofshit.
- I'm all right. I'm all right. Come on.
- You piece ofshit.
- Get him outta here.
- But I didn't.
I could not hear too good.
[ Distorted Voice ]
You motherfucker.
I couldn't hear too good. You know,
you gotta play things all the way.
- To the bone.
- Yeah.
You gotta playit to the bone.
And I thought I was.
I mean, it's just like
the blink of an eye. You-- You--
You take your eyes offthe road and--
and then you are in a car crash.
[ Chuckles ] Thirty-seven seconds.
That's how much I lasted.
Well, your fight was over,
but your life wasn't over.
Yeah. But they thought that
I could have beaten the count.
They thought I Was Waiting
till ten to get up, so--
so it Would look like I tried
to beat the count, but I failed.
I -- I swear on my father's grave
that I --
I couldn't hear the count.
- I-- I couldn't.
- Motherfucker.
[ Sighs ]
Joe Domino told everybody I quit.
He said that I have no heart.
- Domino's a dick.
- Yeah, but he's the man.
Yeah, the man's a dick.
You know something?.
- Velario was a fag.
- Oh, yeah?.
- Nah.
- Oh, yeah! Men, women, whatever, man.
- I got beat by a fag.

More than average.
Wha--

Experiment-- Hey, hey, Grace,

- Sure, I kneW.
- You know, I mean, it only lasted
for a year. I didn't dig it.
Well, ifyou didn't dig it, why didn't

I don't need a fuckin' year...
- to figure out whether or not
I like it!
- Well, I was trying things!
You know?. I mean, you got

attached to an all-cotton athletic boot,
good for those men who suffer

or colored dyes
on their feet.

- Oh, yeah.
- [ Woman ] Oh. Ciao.
[ Foreign Language ]

I could takeyou up

Ifyou don't mind,
I would love to showyou the plans...
of my product idea, the periscope
I was telling you about?.
It's upside-down.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
[ Groans ] Vince, I don't know

Hey, hey, this'll work.
Trust me.
- Thousand, red.
- Right here.
- [Ball Rolling]
- [Vince ]
You gotta bet some to Win some.
[Dealer]
Eleven, black.
-Jesus Christ.
- Hey, hey, hey.
No problem. Let's double the bet.
Two thousand, red.
What-What

[ Chuckles ]
Hey, after tonight,
the wayyou hit,
I got new respect
for fags.
Vince, Vince, I--
I am not a fag, you know?.
I mean, that's
a very primitive way ofthinking.
No, no, no, no.
I'm saying, ifyou were a fag,
ifyou were-- You know, it's okay.
You know,
ifyou were a fag.
Rudy, get this bitch
out ofhere.

[ Gasps ]
All right.
J ust leave me alone.
Guys, wait!
Where you goin'?.

I'm driving.

- What are you doin'?. Get in the back.
[ Cesar]
In the back.
??[Woman Vocalizing]
Grace, did you go
to the party?.
Mm-hmm.
Didn't like it.
Why do rich men thinkwomen'll sleep
with them just 'cause they got dough?.
A woman would rather have a poor guy
that knows how to make love to her...
than a rich guy
who doesn't.
- Am I wrong?.
- Uh, oh--
- No.
- Maybe not " poor" poor,
but moderatelywell off
would be okay.
Moderatelywell-off guy
who's a good lay...
and who ain't threatened by a woman
who wants to run her own company.
- Yeah.
- I gotta be my own boss. That's clear.
I can't work for anybody.
I just wanna hit 'em all the time.
Let me see.
Hey, you know with
these new product ideas I got,
I'm gonna look for money in L.A.
- I like L.A.
- Yeah.
Most people don't,
but I do.
What about an extremely poor guy
who's a moderately good lay?.
No?. Well,
just curious.
So where wereyou guys?.
- Oh, we went out, walked around
the pool, talkin' to people--
- We were just hanging around.
- Got anything left?.
- Thirteen grand.
- You still owe me five.
- Can I payyou two
and oweyou the rest?.
- Sure.
- That's good.
I got 1 1,000.
Vince's fucking system.
Hey, hey.
Look at it this way.
This is moneywe didn't have
when we woke upyesterday, right?.
- Yeah. [ Mumbles ]
- Huh?. [ Chuckles ]
Grace,
who doyou think
won the fight, Vince or me?.
I think
it was a fair decision.
- Fair.
- Okay. Fine.
Did you hear those people
cheering for us, man?.
- That was great, wasn't it?.
- That was fucking great.
- Oh, that was great.
- That was fucking great, man.
