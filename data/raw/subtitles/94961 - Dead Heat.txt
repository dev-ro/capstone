Good morning investigator
what is the situation?
An ongoing robbery
Criminals entered with automatic weapons to the jewelry store, we will knock them out when they come out
I did not plan better than this Lieutenant

How much money is there? - a lot, leave it -

Why did not these two men die?
We fired at them about 50 bullets
Their wounds may be superficial

Please do not thank me, Lieutenant
I just do my duty
You should know that the captain will know about it
Oh God, do you think he would like to talk to us?
Unauthorized use of a police vehicle
To endanger lives and property as a result of recklessness
Use of an irregular weapon
This was my fault, sir (not wrong) Peugeot
Disrespectful behavior
Disrespectful and tasteless oral observations
That was me
And 18 car park violations so far this month
Do I need to make it clear that you are already under the control of behavior twice?
This cowboy adventure this morning has made you vulnerable
And you will end up in waste
If you fail again
Captain, this guy deserves a medal and I deserve a medal also to save him
Listen, I'm aware
(It was wailing though (Hurdzhug
You guys have done the job that you can not
So I will be more lenient with you

I would like to be a human target for anyone within the desirable range of donut shop

So what are your conclusions about these little adventures, Dorothy?
So far we have six theft cases
Two banks and a local jeweler and goldsmith
All in the past three weeks, all in the same area of ​​nine

How many gang members do you think, Roger?
I can not be sure
The descriptions are always different therefore inevitably there is a group of them
Maybe they turn around
Sure they are the same?
They have the same methodology in the way they work
Two armed men
They often attack in broad daylight
In indifference to their personal safety
Yes, when you call them do not die
Some drugs give this effect
Users of pentachlorophenol
They can get rid of feeling all bodily injuries
Even bullet wounds, O (Rogge)?

That is empty talk, he shouted

I (Smithers) have something for you to come to the morgue as soon as you can
Have you ever wondered about the day you died, Roger?
Let's assume that the day of your death
On April 23 and you knew that somehow
You can organize a party for your day and your death
(You have gone beyond the stage of strangeness, Beglow, you are approaching the stage of deterioration
You can completely dull, yell

Hello, Rebecca

(I have a phone at home, O (Roger

As an excuse to ask about my health is not exactly
What I might call thoughtful thinking
She says I'm deteriorating
So, what happened to this unknown?
What is incredible?
I will show you
(A good injury, O (Roger - thanks -
Is there enough to identify the body?
I was wondering about the same thing
It is virtually impossible to distinguish the body through teeth and fingerprints
But I did not notice one thing
What? - Stitches -
You can see the incision that passed through the rib cage
Open with an electric saw
Have you undergone surgery?
Both
Underwent an autopsy
They came here before, you guys
I documented the death certificate myself
I even took pictures

(All of us are wrong, Dr. Smithers
Dr. McNab, it is not my habit to sign a death certificate for someone who is not feeling well
I hope so
But the fact is that you either failed or that these two bodies woke up after you finished the autopsy
And crawl out
I do not forget any body, Doctor
She has a beautiful future in 5 years but currently
He rushed to the imaginary conclusions
Without searching for the truth
This is what the anatomy of your masters is
Foolish
What did you say? - that's cool -
Yes, right? - You have to admit that it is very strange -
Strange, true - about your permission -
Doctor, what is this used?
You would prefer not to know
Duck knock
Have you come to read my rights?
Was it a spoon or two of sugar?
Two, but I left him
I thought you quit smoking, too
True, but when I give up bad habit I usually get bad other
lethal
I came to offer my moral support
Do not you think fish should swim?
No, so I do not have to feed them and they are very beautiful
As for the corpses, do you believe me?
Surely there is something strange going on
I agree
Have you found anything else strange in those bodies?
In addition, they do not remain dead?
Yes -
I found something unusual in the tissues of their skin
like what?
(Small amounts of sulfathiazole)
It is an old product used against bacterial infections
A dangerous substance
Dante), for pharmaceuticals)
Recent purchases were (50 kg) of sulfathiazole
(Tulle you talk ya (Roger I do not know how to say this
To convey the truth only
We are looking for someone who kidnaps dead bodies and brings them back to life to steal jewelry stores

What's going on, officers?
We can not disclose details
Miss James, but we are interested in a recent purchase order
(You have made a drug called sulfathiazole
If you know any zombie
What did you say?
Is this drug usually used?
For many things
Let me show you our main product line
Most of our products are sold without prescription
Not very important for a non-specialist
Cosmetics, hygiene items, toiletries, etc.
The material is used by everyone but nobody likes to talk about it
Health-giving products, Means for the treatment of hemorrhoids
Among other things
Hello
Hello
(I'll do some investigations, Roger
Go ahead, sir
All our products are tested thoroughly before being marketed
Great, dogs get skin cancer instead
(You will tell us about sulfathiazole
Yeah
Nothing special in it
Used until the 1940s, it was replaced
But we still use it
As an antiseptic and herbal skin lotion
I hope you do not feel resentful, but
Have you ever seen these two people?
Start
No, I can not say I'm sorry
What is that?
It is sad but is also necessary
When we have to kill some sick animals, we put them here
The room is airtight
The piston discharges the air in a few seconds
The animal dies quickly and quietly
Is not there one same in the (Disneyland)?
That's it, sir
I hope that what I have given you is useful
What is there?
Toxic waste products

But what about the soul, O Becky?
Apparently they (they also found a solution to that, Doug

Then I hope to shoot him in the head

What are you doing here, Rebecca?

... After thinking about it, I
I feel great
I feel very comfortable

Sorry to disappoint you, Doctor
What else do you remember?
Well, we were
We took a look at the research headquarters
And (Dog), was fighting that creature
I was locked in that room, and
I think he fainted
It was as if I were pushing into this strange light or something
I looked down and saw myself
physical
I was lying there
I extended my hand to touch it, and it was
As if I had been hit by 10,000 volts
It is unusual but it happened before
Clinically deceased people return to life at the last possible moment
(An hour passed on the death of Roger
What?
Do not you realize? We have already prepared him for life
Gosh
What is the matter?
I did not find a pulse
Do not be silly
Can I borrow your headset, please?
It is clear that this headset is not working
Give me that
This thing does not work, huh?
You make it up
He makes it up
I do not know what's going on here, but I want Mortis to return (to the laboratory for some analysis)
He does not need analysis, he's dead
!dead
This is ridiculous
Becky), we both saw that man (the owner of the hideous face)
It looked much worse
This is crazy I have not felt better in my whole life
It is hard to believe without a pulsating heart
Dr. Smithers, I have two bodies in the next room
I doubt that they will return to life
You know where you find me
After you finish this farce
Gosh
Oh my God, your body is cold
what the hell?
Why did not I bleed?
Moment
I'm not dead I'm more energetic than you
Roger), thanks to the revival machine)
I still can not believe this
Sorry, Doug, but I still can not believe it
You will overcome it (as time goes by, Roger
It is the perfect way of life
It is easy for you to say that
Roger), did not hear the worst of it)
(I'm dead, Rebecca) How bad can things get worse?
View the lab report
The rehabilitation process has a benign side view
What is the?
Gradual decomposition of tissues returned to life
Damage to untreated cells
You have about 10 to 12 hours, max
so what?
All your body cells will degrade and turn into organic soup
Becky), can not you return it (again using the machine?
This machine is not (Toaster, O (Doug
Back to the laboratory Maybe we can do something
The most important thing for me now
He is the Nile who made this me
You understand that, do not you?
(Personally, I will grab his heart with my bare hand, Roger
I hold his heart in the palm of my hand
And watching his heart stop throbbing together
(That's good, Doug, but let's find it first
from where we start?
(To find out) Randy James
(Roger)
We'll meet you in the lab
You have 12 hours to 10
Do not waste it
Do you know what is strange about it
I feel fine

I injured myself while shaving
Can I ask you some questions?
I do not know anything about what happened there today
I got scared and left, did you understand me?

What a beautiful house
Can you now tell us the essence of the subject?
I told you
I am responsible for their PR
At least you are as well until you appear
What if she threatened her and scared her a little?
I understood
You are the strict policeman
And your colleague is a nice policeman
Because it does not look scary as he puts lipstick
Miss James, I've been locked up in that room where they kill animals and some people get lost
Someone choked me who puts me in a bad mood
All I want is to find it

!right Now
Where does this lead us? - To the outer courtyard -
Damn
This is really very nasty
What is going on?
There seems to be someone who wants you dead
They were too successful, too
But why, I did not do anything
Maybe because of what you know - I do not know anything at all -
I was only a guide for visitors and a writer for press releases
Roger (I was immersed in the jacuzzi) for 5 minutes continuously
Yes right
Do you teach me to do this with my girlfriend?
Curse
they died
They always die because of me
There were compelling circumstances
"You do not understand the fish" The ruby ​​devil was my favorite
Everything I love always dies
Princess, I hope you have understood what I was trying to tell you
I knew that man
For more questions, contact my lawyer
... and always remember how much
How extraordinary you are

How can I help you?
What did Dante send you?

Perhaps more important than you think
If your friend makes one step he is a dead man

I do not understand what is happening but I suddenly lose my appetite
What is that?
Enough, from now on I am a vegetarian

He died March 4th
Here's another
Howard Davidson (commodity broker) died on April 3
Do you see any link?
All of them as a group of bisexual in my opinion
I think everyone has big bank accounts when he dies
All of them are rich dead What does it mean?
I'm not sure
But your father seems to be one of the victims
This is crazy
In any case this is not a normal issue
They can cancel the obituary
Rouge (What's up, man?) You seem to be suddenly alarmed
These are the helpers
Add new deaths all the time
They will write my obituary

Do you know what I heard one day?
What?
I heard that the world's population has grown a lot
And that half of contemporary people
Are still alive today
Barbak - that's right -
If you compare all those who have died since the beginning of history
With the current population about the same number
So if someone asks you when you will die
You can really say, do not know
So far only half has happened
Not only that, if you multiply the population of Rhode Island (by the square root of my former wife's weight)
Actually, you both know how to make a girl enjoy her time

Gosh
(Roger)
(He is a dog
Let us bring him down
Randy?)
Randy?)
(I'm sorry, Roger
I did not want to tell you
I did not think you'd understand that
What are you talking about?
...I
Lied about drug rehabilitation
... I was in hospital because I was
I was dying
I was dead
what do you mean?
Bring me back to life (just like you, Roger
But they said I would live a normal life, provided I helped them
Help who?
They lied to me
Who, O (Randy)?
(I'm sorry, Roger
(I'm sorry, Roger
please forgive me
(Alo, I) Rebecca
Listen, Rebecca
I do not exist to answer you
Leave me a message and I'll get back to you not really
(Rebecca), he died (Doug)
Randy (died)
...I wish if
Really, I wish
Hey
Numbers parallel to letters
B
O
D
Y
Body <font color = "# ff8000"> Body </ font>
Damn, those are
! (Roger)
what are you doing here?
What do you think, (McNab)?
You'll be more detailed
Listen, if you want details
you killed me
(And killed (Dogg) and maybe you did not kill (Randy
But you had to have the morality to let her stay dead
What topic are you talking about?
Revenge, McNab, against you unless I get quick answers
But this is unreasonable I was helping you
I do not think so
Thinking (Ludermilk), designed a machine to revive people
You've tried it, have not you?
This is ridiculous
Of course (you lose your right, Roger
Your mind is deteriorating
When you buried him alive Ludermilk), wanted to charge you)
But he was afraid to write (McNab's name)
For fear that it will come back and erase it
So try something more subtle
It's an encrypted message
Using an icon inspired by phone keys
This is its abbreviation
Body doc <font color = "# ff8000"> Doctor of Bodies </ font>
Sounds a bit like you, right?
(This is what happens when you die, O Roger
Your nerve points converge, leading to all kinds of crazy conclusions
(My mind was never so clear, McNab
As well as my correction
You bastard
How many other people have been buried alive, McNab?
Canfield), king of blue jeans)
Oliver Lang), (Howard Preston)?)
Take these people's money to keep them alive, right?
!this is a lie
nice watch
Beautiful ring, too
My guess is that they belong to stolen jewelry shops
Give me that
When you revive these thieves you want to try them
So you send them to do what they steal to steal things
When I discovered all this she killed me
It is an intangible evidence that will not be accepted in any court
(I will not wait for any trial, O McNab
! (Roger)
I can help you
She also helped (Randy James)?
Good evening, Doctor
I 've been too late.
This villain almost killed me
Give me a diamond ring
(In fact, Roger) every action has some benefits
It takes some time to find them
And not all the world's money will compensate you (what will happen to you) McNab
The investigator appears to be in poor condition
(Not as bad as it will be, O) Theol
They shut him up
Thank
How do you want us to kill this man?
(I started to love you as my son, Roger
You are honest, trustworthy and depend on you as a scout boy
O irony, is not it, Roger?
You will spend your last moments and inches of freedom
Here in front of the morgue
For this very reason, Doctor, we should not waste more time
Yes, yes, put it in the truck
They tied him in the side bars
Please do not mind having a partner
Yes, I know it's annoying
But Smithers has long been a nuisance
(I'll send you to hell, McNab
You can not make me stay here
This truck is all armored and soundproofed if you think of asking for help
It is custom-made ideal biodegradable place
Which I think will happen almost within 45 minutes
Let 's go, Doctor, they' re waiting for us in the lab
Yes, close the door
close the door
(Happy trip, O (Roger
Rebecca), I've always thought we'd be together at the end)
But never on this picture
(Rebecca)
you and me
We will go on
round
Wow
This would be great
!Oh my God
Come on, you guys
Help me, help me
More hoses here
The area is hot there
I understood
You have to stay away, people
Jesus Christ
Welcome, Mr. You're not okay
Stop
its enough
I am the investigator (Mortis), the homicide department
You are a cop
!Surprise
I need your weapon, officer
Thank
ladies and gentlemen
Last week we were all shocked and saddened
With the news of the sudden death of Arthur B. Woodermelck
I would like to take the opportunity
To review his many achievements
But hey, why do not we let Arthur () tell you himself?)
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you (Arthur B. Ludermelk)
Dear friends and colleagues
I am pleased to see you again
(I saw you buried, O Arthur
Damn I saw you buried
(Unfortunately, you were fooled (Walter
The person who occupies my grave, is
Volunteer personally selected (by Dr. McNab)
As you will see, ladies and gentlemen
The presentation that you are going to see makes the funeral unnecessary
Have you built an aviation empire?
Only to divide your wealth among a group of wolves
Who are the trolling relatives?
Gertrude Bellman), would it be satisfactory) to see your name on a memorial plaque in the library?
(We shall all die, O Arthur
We have every means to avoid this (O) Gertrude
How many do you think we have of the rich there tonight?
Is not it frustrating that all that money
And all that innate power in your grip
Then disappear, suddenly
Suddenly, your case ends up 6 feet below the ground
While a handful of petty greed will devour everything you care about, and rodents devour a piece of cheese
Is not this sad?
Everyone is dying, rich and poor
Death does not exclude anyone
At least not yet
This is ridiculous
Well, let's face it
The poor are supposed to die
But the same rule does not apply to us
We are rich
Mr. wants us to live forever and if he does not want to
We can always bribe him
It will cost you half of your wealth
But you will have eternity to restore it
(Think of what I'm offering, Seth
Life without end
The profits of your own investments will increase for millions of years
What is your trick, Arthur?
It is not gimmick but eternal life
Bullshit
I know this sounds silly
It seems impossible but I am a living guide
I have prepared a small graphic for you
This man died of several hours
Come on, examine it yourself
Sit
As you have all seen, this man is dead
I will give you a small presentation of the product
Dr. McNab, if you would? - Of course -
This model is our latest model
Which grants eternal life without any restrictions
All right, do not rise
kill him
I asked that no one rise
what do you want?
You are not an old man
I want it
(You are in the dead, O McNab
You are dead more than I am
I do not think so
(Dogg)
Dogg), you are alive)
(He can not understand what you're saying, Roger
His brain had been dead for a long time
Which means that he is mindless and very obedient
Will you kill this man?
Will you kill this man?
Dogg), stopped)
(This is me, O (Doug (Roger)
Will you kill this man?
Dogg), do not do)
Will you kill this man? - (Dog) -
(Listen, O (Doug
Do you realize that we will die on the same day?
Doug), do you know what we can do?) We can have a party for our day of death
We can invite all our friends
And we sink in
!do something
Kill him, come on, you dead brain dead
! (Dogg)
Do you remember lipstick?
Purple wine?
Highlights the color of my eyes?
Roger (?)
! (Roger)
(Hello, Doug
Welcome to the zombie homeland
(Roger)
... ordered me to
He ordered me to hurt you
But I will hurt him
Will you kill this man?
Hey, Willie, no
!Kill him
Why do not you kill him?
"Shut up, you stinking old man!"
No, you will not kill me, you bastards
you tricked me
(Damn you, O McNab! You fooled me
(It's over, Roger. Forget it, man
Not yet
Hello, Doctor
Do you want to see what happens when someone revives for two?
not really
Woe, no, no, no
Hey!
Save the machine
It is exposed to an electric palace
We can fix it
I can make you natural again
They are immortal
I will give you what you desire
Money, power, eternal life
Wealth beyond your most beautiful dreams
But save the machine
No, no, stop
Stop!
Wait!
Wait, you do not understand
You will live forever
!forever
Oh hell, you're in a pitiful state (oh Roger
I saw a loaf of meat looks better than you
You are not in good shape
We kicked his ass, did not we? We spent them
(Their asses, O (Roger
Roger), do you think we'll get hurt again?)
In what?
I do not know, maybe you can choose to be the person you want to be
You mean, as a politician, or a president?
Or an award-winning novelist?
Personally I like the Incarnation as a seat for a girl bike
This is really inspiring
Thank
Do you know, Doug? - What? -
Perhaps this is the end of a beautiful friendship
