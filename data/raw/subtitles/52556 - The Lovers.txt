THE LOVERS
Bravo, Raoul!
Come, Kiki.
What style!
Isn't he fantastic?
Oh, you know I'm no judge.
No, Jeanne Tournier
knew nothing about polo.
At times she accompanied
her friend Maggy.
Friends from childhood,
they were both provincials
by birth and by education.
But while Maggy had married
and now led an exciting life in Paris,
Jeanne had stayed in Dijon
to wed Henri Tournier,
publisher of the Burgundy Monitor.
Henri loved his wife
but devoted most of his time
to his newspaper.
Several years
passed in this way.
Encouraged by her husband,
she'd recently taken to visiting
Maggy twice a month in Paris.
She had fun,
met all sorts of people,
and received reassuring compliments.
At Maggy's, Jeanne met
Raoul Florès.
He's never played so well.
He's unbeatable.
Bravo, Raoul!
You were wonderful.
Here, take this hideous thing.
How do you always
look so lovely?
Were you bored?
On the contrary.
You almost made me lose.
Me?
I could think of nothing but you.
Really?
- Do you still like me a little?
- Yes, I do.
I'm still formal with you,
I'm afraid.
I'll go change.
I'll be back in five minutes.
Let me look at you.
Love agrees with you.
You're unrecognizable.
Love agrees with you.
You're unrecognizable.
- Hello, madame.
- Hello, Coudray.
- How's everything?
- Fine.
I'm dead tired.
Then madame must rest.
Catherine!
Darling!
Not so fast! You'll fall.
My little baby!
Were you a good girl?
Hello, Marthe.
Madame's changed her hairstyle.
Me? I don't think so.
Yes, it's like my dolly's hair.
That little hussy?
Thank you very much.
Where's Papa?
- Can't you hear?
I'll be up to say good night, darling.
Hello, darling.
Why so affectionate?
Affectionate?
I'm just being myself.
Am I disturbing you?
I always do, don't I?
"Always" is a woman's word.
Did you have fun in Paris?
- "Fun" is a man's word.
- Instead of being witty -
First, I'm not witty.
Second, I'm doing the best I can.
No, you could go see about dinner.
Very well. I'll change in no time
and be back in a sec.
"No time," "in a sec."
That's Maggy talk.
Thank you, Coudray.
Well?
You've no idea how important
one's hairstyle is in Paris.
It can be sleek or windswept,
but it must be stylish.
It's the hair
that makes a dress chic.
Thanks to hairstyling,
you recognize -
Who?
Everyone.
American women, Swedish women,
Parisians, provincials - everybody.
There's some truth in that.
Maggy knows these things.
She says if you're not a great beauty,
you must have a look.
Why do you need a look?
You have a husband.
Who hardly notices me.
If that's so, for whom
do you wish to have a look?
No one.
For myself. To be fashionable.
It's my right.
And dear Maggy?
Still as silly
and as busy as ever?
What can I say?
Make fun of her if you like.
I'm not.
I'm merely stating facts.
To me Maggy means phony chic,
phony society, phony Paris,
phony everything.
Even her dog's phony.
You're being nasty.
Not at all.
I'm very fond of her.
Just yesterday I put her picture
on the women's page.
"At the Bagatelle Polo Club,
Madame Marguerite Thiébaut-Leroy
awards the Carven Cup
to Raoul Florès, team captain -"
That's right.
I know him well.
I saw him every day.
Interested in polo now?
Is he handsome?
More than that,
he's very kind and intelligent.
You'd like him. Besides -
Here, this one's for you.
I had no time to talk to Coudray.
Anything new? Any problems?
How's the garden?
You wouldn't need to ask
if you spent less time
ignoring what goes on here.
I'll get it.
Speaking.
All right.
Now?
No, I'll decide myself.
I'll take care of it.
See you later, Hélène dear.
I must go to the office.
What a bother!
Anything I can do to help?
You look sad.
Me? I'm not sad.
Why aren't you sad?
"You're unrecognizable,"
Maggy had said.
Henri hadn't noticed a thing.
Monsieur spoils Catherine
when Madame's gone.
She's putting on airs.
It amuses him.
- No, that one needs mending.
It's bad for the child.
She does whatever she wants.
If he spoils her like this,
she'll give you trouble later.
By a strange quirk of character,
Jeanne felt a surge of jealousy.
Is Madame going out?
Good evening, Marcelot.
I'd like to see my husband.
He's... seeing the paper to press.
I'll get him.
I'll go with you.
I'm Hélène Cavalier,
Mr. Tournier's secretary.
Marcelot said you were here.
I hope it's nothing serious.
What gave you that idea?
I'm sorry. We're not used
to seeing you here.
And at this hour?
It startled me.
Don't worry.
I just dropped by
to see my husband.
He's in the type room.
Hélène, where were you?
Madame Tournier.
Surprised?
She's a lucky one.
Who?
Her.
Jeanne, be serious.
I have no time to waste.
Why have you come?
I don't know.
Henri's lack of interest in her
made Jeanne feel free.
Her stays in Paris
grew longer and more frequent.
Good morning, Chantal.
What time is it?
- 11:45.
Mrs. Tournier's been up for ages.
Of course.
May I?
Did you sleep well?
You like this?
It's all right.
What's wrong?
Get up on the wrong side of the bed?
Raoul adores you.
Isn't that enough?
Let yourself be loved.
I am.
I know 30 women who'd die for him.
But you needn't worry.
He's at your feet.
When you're away, he spends
sleepless nights wondering about you.
He's used to certainty,
and you've thrown him off track.
He told me so.
It keeps me from sleeping too.
Until noon.
Do you love Raoul or not?
- I guess so.
- What an answer!
Don't you come to Paris
to see him?
Can't you decide
to be happy for once?
What more do you need?
What could be more natural
after eight years of marriage?
At least he hasn't made you
his slave.
You're lucky to be so bored at home.
Boredom is a rest cure.
Believe me, I could use one.
A rest cure at home,
and you're complaining?
I'm not.
Oh, it's you. Hold on.
It's Raoul.
Good morning.
And you?
Don't forget dinner
at the Andrés' tonight - no excuses.
Let's get away from them.
- No, we can't.
- Coming?
- Jeanne's tired.
- Come on. Just for a few minutes.
We won't stay out late.
Wait for me!
Stand clear! Prepare for takeoff!
I'd like to make you happy.
But I am happy.
We only get moments together.
I want a lifetime with you.
I often wonder why you love me.
I've told you a thousand times:
Because you're different.
- Different?
- From other women.
I hate all these women
who chase you while I'm away.
Don't be silly.
I just want to say that I trust you.
My love.
You seem sad.
What's wrong?
I'm jealous that you're going home
tomorrow to your life, your husband.
Let's not speak of him.
I think I'll move to Dijon
and sneak into your room
at night like a thief.
No, don't get out.
Jeanne's uneasy double life
would not last long.
One night,
before leaving for Paris...
...cream cheese, squash,
lamb, lettuce and fruit salad.
Marthe, please give
the week's menus to Coudray.
Very well.
- Good night.
- See you Sunday.
Weren't you going
to say good night?
I thought you were asleep.
You only had to look up
and see the light in my window.
Look at me.
You don't look like
you came from a business dinner.
Everyone always drinks too much.
Too much.
You're off again, I see.
Haven't you had enough of Paris?
It's a pleasant change.
Maybe for you.
I'm fed up with it.
I wasn't planning to go,
but you were going away.
I canceled my Swiss trip
three days ago.
Yes, but I'd already told Maggy
I was coming.
Don't make excuses!
Excuses only cover up lies.
Just let me say I'm surprised.
You've known Maggy since childhood.
She's your best friend.
You can see her
anytime you please.
Yet you can't get out of this.
It's unbelievable.
- She's easily upset.
- Let her be! I don't care!
And if she's
as touchy as you say,
why isn't she upset
that you never invite her here?
You'll kindly call her
tomorrow morning
and say we expect her
next weekend.
I'll be seeing her
tomorrow in Paris.
You don't have to go!
Listen here, Henri.
Drink doesn't agree with you.
She's giving a dinner for me
with the Dupuis, the Dupas,
the Sanders and Raoul Florès -
- Of course.
- You think that's funny?
She can invite whomever she wants.
- Whomever you want.
- Excuse me!
If you only knew him -
- That's entirely up to you.
Are you crazy?
You're dreaming!
"Raoul and Maggy" -
that's all I ever hear.
If they're so inseparable,
invite them both.
- You're mad!
- I insist.
Invite them both on my behalf.
You'll be sorry.
They'll bore you to death.
Bore me? Far from it.
I'm dying to meet this pair
that seems to amuse you so.
You never cease to amaze me.
Leaving after one day because
of your husband's silly weekend!
I came for your dinner
and to talk to you.
About Henri's dreadful idea?
Call him. Say we can't come
and that you're staying.
He'll quite happily go fishing.
I can't, Maggy, and you know it.
- I'm leaving.
- I wish I could go with you.
If you did, Maggy wouldn't come.
Don't be late.
Don't worry.
- I'm afraid.
- Of what?
Everything.
Everything?
Even me?
Then who?
- I don't know.
When I think of you and me,
I'm always worried.
Perhaps that's what love is.
Finally! I can't believe it!
You're the first to stop!
- The first?
You're joking.
- I'm not.
My car's broken down.
- A tire?
- No, the engine.
The engine?
Then I'm not your man.
Engines and I don't see eye to eye.
If you could just try it -
- It's dead.
- And so?
So for lungs or intestines,
I'm no doctor.
It looks dead,
but I suggest an operation.
If you'd take me to the nearest
garage, I could manage.
All right. Get in.
I'm in a hurry to reach Dijon.
And you?
Are you from around here?
No, just visiting.
Anybody here?
Present!
Is there no one here?
Sorry. I didn't see you.
My car's broken down.
My car's broken down!
Don't waste your breath.
He's deaf.
Is that your car?
- If only it were.
Mine's down the road
about four miles from here.
That's bad.
What is it?
- A Peugeot 203.
- What?
- A Peugeot 203!
That's even worse.
This is a Renault garage.
Don't get upset, lady.
I'd be happy to help,
but you'll have to wait.
But I'm in a terrible hurry!
I'm repairing the tow truck!
Do you at least have a phone?
In the back.
- Do you need me anymore?
- I guess not. Thank you.
What's the best way
to Montbard from here?
I'd like Dijon 413.
Thanks. Good-bye.
Miss, cancel that call.
Sorry to be nosy,
but if you're going to Dijon,
could you drop me there?
- My car's nothing fancy.
- As long as it runs!
I must warn you, I don't drive fast.
I hate speeding.
And I have to stop in Montbard
to see an old professor of mine.
To give him some books.
- Will it take long?
- Only a second.
- That's fine.
My suitcase!
Never mind.
I can send for it later.
All that matters is that
I be home by 8:00.
Bernard Dubois-Lambert.
I know a Dubois-Lambert
who plays golf at St-Cloud.
Jacques.
My cousin.
I avoid him like the plague.
He's a charming man.
The Dubois-Lamberts are related
to the Kléber sugar family.
- So I hear.
- And the Thiébaut-Leroy wool family.
I know them all. Maggy Thiébaut-Leroy
is my closest friend.
- I pity you.
- You know her?
No, thank God.
Only by reputation.
I avoid all those awful people.
You were right.
You certainly don't speed along.
I do what I can.
Crazy driver!
What?
Hurry! Try to catch them!
- Catch who?
- Them!
I asked them to dinner tonight.
- You shouldn't have.
Where are you going?
I told you. I have to stop
to see my old professor.
Just a second.
Your joke's gone too far.
I didn't force you to come along.
- You said just a second!
- A figure of speech.
It was 45 minutes.
I'm sorry. I didn't know
my friend wasn't well.
He's sick.
My visit did him good.
He set out
crackers and wine for me,
and he kept on talking.
He'd have been hurt
if I hadn't stayed.
To the right.
What time is it?
- 8:10.
- That's awful!
If they're real friends,
they won't mind.
I wanted to greet them.
My husband barely knows them.
- He doesn't know your friends?
- He didn't want to.
- Is he some kind of bear?
- Yes, that's exactly what he is.
And you're afraid
the bear will frighten your friends.
Precisely.
So you married a bear.
A bear who owns
the Burgundy Monitor.
Does the whole town stare
when he leaves the house?
We live outside of Dijon.
Besides, we're used to it.
Tell me: Is he dark brown?
Big? Fat? Enormous?
Very big.
Then he's an Ursus giganteus.
Does he wear a cap?
Sometimes.
He speaks several languages,
drives his car himself,
eats only honey, fruit and eggs,
is subject to violent fits,
and crushes people he dislikes.
Sounds like you know him.
I know animals.
That way.
Good God! Two corpses
flattened in their chairs
and a big brown bear watching us.
Is that your husband?
It's just nerves.
I see a brown bear!
- When did this start?
- Just as we pulled up.
- Henri Tournier, her husband.
- So I gathered.
Bernard Dubois-Lambert.
- François' son?
- His nephew.
I haven't seen François in ages.
He's one of my best friends.
What happened?
...and after a quick stop in Montbard,
we came straight here.
Thank you for being so kind.
No trouble at all.
I was going to spend
the night in Dijon anyway.
I won't hear of it.
You'll dine with us...
and stay overnight.
- But -
- No buts about it. I insist.
- I wouldn't want to -
- Well, I would.
Excuse me a moment.
- You'll ruin my hair.
- It's not even fixed yet.
They're waiting.
What's wrong with you?
I wonder.
Did you ask Coudray
to set an extra place?
What about a room?
- I'll see to it.
- Which one?
- The green room.
What a lovely house.
Beautiful country.
It's too far from the sea for me.
What can one do here all day?
One could settle down here.
Ask Jeanne
what she thinks about that.
- Jeanne?
- Madame Tournier.
She jumps at the slightest chance
to come to Paris.
In Paris, life is an adventure.
And leaves you stranded.
- Poet or pessimist?
- Archeologist.
I share your affection
for these provincial homes.
They evoke nostalgia in me,
the verdant paradise of childhood.
Excuse me, sir.
May I show you to your room?
Mr. Tournier insists
that I stay overnight.
I'm delighted.
We'll dine in five minutes.
Forgive me?
Have you calmed down?
I'm so embarrassed.
I never saw you
really laugh before.
What did the young man
say to you?
Why'd Henri invite him?
He's silly and pretentious and gets -
On your nerves?
Dinner is served.
Maggy on Henri's right, of course.
Raoul here.
- This doesn't make me feel younger.
- What?
All this.
The walls, these things.
You haven't changed a thing.
Is it courage or laziness?
If I had,
where would I find my youth?
Everything here
makes me feel young.
That's fine in the provinces,
but if you lived in Paris!
Everyone's buying Louis XV now.
I'm in antique shops all the time.
I never have soup.
You feel younger sleeping in some
stranger's love nest or deathbed?
I don't think about that.
I just try not to clash
with what's in style.
Could you ever possibly?
- Raoul was in Russia, you know.
- I didn't know that.
Jeanne's fears proved justified.
Dinner was a disaster.
Raoul made polite conversation
to fill the silence.
A frontier is merely a line
you step across.
With that one step,
you're in a foreign land.
Are Russians really foreign?
For a Spaniard like me,
no more than Germans or French.
Germans.
That's a bit much.
A bird!
Light a candle
and turn out the lights.
"Am I bird or am I mouse?"
It's a harmless little bat.
Maggy, you've forgotten
your childhood.
Please go on.
You were saying that in Moscow -
Differences are striking
when you travel.
In Moscow I saw no dogs, beggars,
baby buggies or bicycles.
- Sounds marvelous!
- But did people look happy?
Do they anywhere?
How people look
depends on the weather.
If it's rainy and cold,
they're grumpy,
but on a nice day -
- It's gone.
- The filthy thing!
I was in Russia as a tourist.
Then you saw nothing.
I found Dostoyevsky,
Gogol, Tolstoy -
Raoul has friends everywhere.
Do go on.
I so long to see Russia.
Darling...
you long to see Russia?
Why didn't you say so?
I thought you wanted us
to go to Florence
on a second honeymoon.
Second honeymoon?
Yes, and after eight years
of marriage.
Amazing but true.
Jeanne and I don't change
like weathervanes.
My compliments.
To our love, darling.
Are you blushing?
Did you tell Coudray
about tomorrow?
What do you mean?
Aren't you going fishing?
No, I thought I'd stay with you.
He's making a great sacrifice.
He adores fishing.
I once did too, before polo lured me
from the joys of nature.
I admire you for playing
that croquet on horseback.
Why?
I hate competition.
I can't bear losing.
Can't one also lose
at love?
You treat love like a sport.
If you do go fishing,
I'd enjoy going with you.
A visit to the ponds of my youth!
Let's all go.
I'll feel young again!
Could you be up by 4:00 a. M?
In Paris I go to bed at 5:00.
It'll be a change, getting up
when I normally go to bed.
What do you say, darling?
So you enjoy fishing?
I do.
Then I'd be delighted.
Will you join us?
- He only likes birds.
- Ornithology?
- Archeology.
Same thing.
Look at these.
Rare 18th-century editions
on archeology in the Autun area.
Quite noteworthy.
Thank you, my dear.
Isn't Châtillon nearby?
Yes, not far.
You've no doubt heard
of the gold and bronze found there.
Of course. I know
the curator of the museum.
I'm not angry.
He's always enjoyed teasing me.
And he's so sweet with you,
you secretive thing!
Raoul, where are you?
In my memories
of a ride at the fair.
Don't trust appearances.
Henri's never like this.
He's just acting.
Good actors can reveal the truth.
- They make lies credible.
- They tell the truth.
I didn't come here
to listen to arguments.
Though I understand Raoul's point.
You understand nothing!
What are your plans, darling?
What plans?
For tomorrow.
Well...
I'm going with you.
That's why I'm off to bed.
- Yes, me too.
I've had an exhausting day.
Coudray, wake us all at 4:00,
except for this gentleman.
- Good night.
- Thank you.
Have a nice trip.
There are cigarettes here
and whiskey there.
Play all the records you like.
Make yourself at home.
Thanks again. Good night.
- Night, dear.
- Go right to bed.
I certainly will.
Ah, a whiff of the good old days!
Sleep well.
No, I can't!
Don't you understand?
- Only too well.
- I'm scared! It's too dangerous!
- Stay!
- I can't!
Her world was falling apart.
A hateful husband,
an almost ridiculous lover.
The tragedy Jeanne thought she was in
had become a farce.
Suddenly she wished
she were someone else.
It was as if he'd been expecting her
yet didn't seem to recognize her.
It's you.
You must be happy
living in such a lovely place.
If only it weren't in the provinces.
I prefer Paris.
Paris. It's the flavor of the day.
Is that what you like?
When I'm tired, everyone bores me,
and you're boring me now.
I don't mean to.
Can't you leave me alone?
I need to think.
Let's think together.
You're so annoying.
I agree.
At times I can't stand myself.
Quite often, I imagine.
What do you do then?
I dream about beautiful things.
Things you don't like.
You don't know
what I like or dislike.
You don't seem to like this sky
or this moonlight... or this house.
Don't talk about the moon
as though you invented it.
Moonlight is fine,
but there's nothing special about it.
Stop sounding like your friend,
Maggy What's-her-name.
Don't feel obliged
to keep me company.
I wouldn't dream of it.
You're too complicated for me.
But not a bad person.
You think so?
I'm sure of it.
"The moon rising
in cloudless skies...
suddenly bathed her
in its silver beam."
Whom do you mean?
"She saw her image
glowing in my eyes.
Her smile
like an angel's did gleam."
"The night is beautiful."
"The night is a woman."
Let me go!
You have no right!
Love can be born
in a single glance.
In an instant, Jeanne felt
all shame and restraint fall away.
She couldn't hesitate.
There's no resisting happiness.
Is this a land you invented...
for me to lose myself in?
Henri sets these traps.
Yes, I know.
Come.
It's Henri.
Come.
Let's go around the other way.
No, not back in your house.
Let's leave.
But I have to change.
Come upstairs with me.
My baby.
You'll catch cold.
My sweet.
My angel.
Sleep, my darling.
Sleep, my little doll.
That was Catherine.
My daughter.
Your daughter?
You choose.
- My darling.
- Don't speak.
I love you.
I love you and I love Catherine.
Take my hand.
We should go.
You're so beautiful.
You're my love.
You're so beautiful.
I've always known you.
I've known only you.
- What did you write?
- Guess.
I'm so happy.
My whole life
would have slipped by.
We have to go.
I'll get dressed.
Are you asleep?
Let me get dressed.
What are you doing?
I always keep the tub full,
and on warm nights,
I take a bath.
You'll have to get used to that.
Is it nice?
No, don't!
You'll wake everyone up!
We'll sleep together always.
I'll take care of you.
My life for yours.
We'll be fine.
You'll see.
It's 4:00, madame.
Thank you, Coudray. I'm up.
- Thank you, Coudray.
- It's time.
What's wrong, my love?
I hate all this.
All what?
All this.
Those footsteps, those voices,
all this domestic hubbub.
This house, your husband,
your friends, your life.
You hate it all?
Even me?
If we'd left last night,
we'd be far away now
on a new morning.
It's still our night,
and when our morning comes,
we'll be far from here.
Then hurry up.
Then let me go.
Never!
Hurry up.
Hurry up.
I love you.
My love...
my life...
my heart.
- My wife?
- Yes.
Yes, I'm yours.
Say it.
I love you.
Forever?
Let's get out of here.
No, don't take anything.
Well, well! I'm speechless.
Did you know him before?
Shut up, Maggy,
and don't try to understand.
You never will.
Up already?
Are you leaving?
Yes, I'm leaving.
She's really amazed me
this time.
Don't be silly, Raoul.
You're not her husband.
The wind's shifted.
You'll have good weather.
Why are you crying?
Night.
I wish it were always night.
Are you very happy?
Very happy, but don't cry.
I'm sorry.
I know it's silly,
but I'm no longer myself.
But I want you to be you.
It's you that I want.
Where shall we go?
It doesn't matter.
I'll go anywhere with you.
- I want to kiss you.
- No, don't look at me.
I'm hungry. Shall we stop?
Jeanne, the sun!
They set off on a long journey,
aware of its uncertainty,
unsure of ever recapturing
the happiness of that first night.
Already, in the treacherous
hours of dawn,
Jeanne had her doubts.
She was afraid,
but she regretted nothing.
