Come…
Come on, buddy!
Watch your step.
Don't let stones prick you.
Keep walking behind me.
Papa!
PAPA!
I can't walk through this water any more.
Moreover, the bombs will get wet.
Why did you carry them along?
I told you not to.
I did leave them behind.
But when you were talking to uncle,
mother asked me to carry them.
Your mom!
Probably she thought her alcoholic
husband would not take care of her son.
So she sent this bundle
of bombs along with food.
You know your mom…Hold this.
But what has mom done?
You always have something to say about her.
Papa! It's all mire down here.
Why don't we walk up there?
Won't it be more comfortable?
Sure, it will be. For those chasing us,
it will be comfortable.
Walk in silence.
Stop!
Papa! Police!
-Wait, wait!
Turn round! Turn round and walk!
Ah. Move, move.
Hey! Stop the vehicle.
Yo! Pass me the torchlight.
Here, Sir.
Where did this lamb
spring from at this hour?
Is someone around or has it strayed?
There was a murder in the
village and a bigwig has died.
The whole village is at
the hospital including kids.
Who would bother about a lamb now?
But how can we be sure
no one will look for it?
It takes two days to even
realize this has gone missing.
Go ahead.
Sir?
Go ahead!
It's tiny and cute.
It's lean and good for the heart. Go on!
Catch it, catch it!
They claim to stall
all wrongs in the world!
They call themselves police!
It was a mistake to spare him this morning.
If we had torn him to pieces when he
hit my son, it wouldn't have come to this.
Stay quiet!
Your children seem to
have inherited all your ire.
What sort of police training you had?
You couldn't even catch a lamb!
On top of that you boast
you are from Godavari.
I wasn't trained to catch a lamb, Sir.
Get lost, man! You talk more than my wife!
Get it started.
Sir... my Master passed away...
He never went out without at least ten
people around.
He always carried a gun along.
How did you simply watch this happen?
We never imagined it would happen this way!
Stop it! You couldn't save him.
Why find excuses?
When the power was off,
he killed Master and left
before we could even blink.
I was there till that moment.
I had just left, Sir!
The big wolf has gone into
the jungle along with baby wolf.
I called you to tell you to hunt them down.
Do you want lumps of flesh or people alive?
-People, of course.
Master!
Go and look for them in the jungle.
My son, Gampi, is already in the forest.
By tomorrow morning, the baby
wolf will be in front of your house.
Greetings, Sir.
Here! There is nothing to worry, brother.
No matter where they hide,
I will find them, file a case
and put them behind bars.
No need, Inspector.
We don't want a case to be filed.
More than the loss of your father, you seem
to be angry why this should happen!
Yo! Whether you want it or not,
we are obliged to file a case.
This was a murder committed in public.
It's enough that you don't interfere in this.
Just as you know how to manipulate people,
we know where to draw a line.
We will take care of what is to be done.
Before my father's ceremony...
-Master!
Useless dimwit! You couldn't save him when
you had to. What's the point in howling now?
Kill this fellow!
Hey! Die, idiot!
By the time my father's ceremony is over,
I will make sure not a single
person from that family is alive.
And then you want to sit in prison?
Why do you have to bother?
This is not your job. It's mine.
It's one thing to kill officially
and another to kill making a scene.
Ok, please carry on.
Sit over there.
Muthanna!
Hey, Muthanna!
Hey, Basavaiah? What is this?
No one imagined it would
lead to killing.
Don't you know how our family has
been suffering for two years, Muthanna?
If my son had brought that guy's
head home, I would have been happier.
That's fine. But where are they all now?
The father-son duo walked
into the jungle and we came here.
What about the house and the orchard?
-We left everything behind.
Please go inside, dear.
If someone hears, they will wake up.
Come, dear. Come inside.
Go in. Go inside.
Muthanna, I have some jewelry with me.
Pawn them. My brother-in-law
would come to milestone number 117.
Can you hand over the money to him?
-Why do you even ask, Basavaiah?
Am I an outsider?
You ask me as if I am an outsider.
Take it.
Do you want some water?
-Hmm.
Here, dear. Keep this.
I take leave.
-Ok.
Uncle, please don't go. Stay with us.
Bujji, if I leave now I can bring
your father and brother soon, right?
We should all go home together, right?
Stay with your mom and I will be back.
Please go ahead, brother. I will take care.
Brother, where is the truck heading for?
First, tell me where you are heading for.
I have to get to the town, brother.
To Tirupati?
-Yes, brother.
Ok.The front seat is vacant.
Go and sit there.
Ok, brother.
Hey, Are you hungry?
-Yes, Papa.
Here. Your mom has packed
some rice here. Have it. - Ok, Papa.
That morning, Sinnabba
and his father Narappa…
…his mother Sundaramma and his uncle Basavaiah-
all of them went in different directions.
All the survivors in Pandusami's family were hell
bent on killing everyone in Sinnabba's family.
The problem Sinnabba's
family is facing now is nothing new.
It's like any other clash between the rich and
the poor, between the powerful and the powerless.
Because a poor man
has no caste or religion.
A rich man has no good will or humanity.
Sinnappa was living in Ramasagaram
The village next to it is Siripi.
Pandusami from Siripi began
to claim lands in Ramasagaram.
Dorasami is Pandusami's brother.
Joining a few people who returned from Rangoon
and made lots of money in Bangalore,
...he has been planning
to set up a cement factory.
We don't know when this is going to happen
but only one thing happens all the time.
Whenever the rich man needs land,
he first eyes the land of the poor man.
Isn't it enough we are
giving you 650 acres?
Why do you want those three acres too?
How can we leave the
forehead of a deity plain?
What you are giving is for the structure.
We need those three acres for the facade.
Those three acres are the reason
why we still enjoy respect from our clan.
How can you give them to those people?
In spite of owning movie theaters, coal furnaces,
a rice mill and clothes stores in the village...
...it is the three acres belonging to Narappa's family
that they badly wanted for their cement factory.
Narappa's eldest son, Munikanna, was
determined not to give that land to anyone.
Hey, Minikanna! Someone said they would never get
married but now he is cycling along with a smile.
Papa, he said he won't get married.
But he never said he wouldn't see a girl.
Did you hear that, brother-in-law?
Hey, keep quiet. He has
consented after a lot of persuasion.
If you tease him now, he
will get angry and go back.
You are right. Look at
him peddling up in a hurry.
As if he gets angry for such things!
He looks fast enough to get married
and come back to meet us on the way.
Send your daughter into Narappa's
family and you can rest assured.
As if we don't know enough about him.
Munikanna is a bit short tempered.
It is your daughter's responsibility to tame him
I shouldn't hide anything, right?
“Smart damsel with naughty glances!
How can I stay away from you?”
Husband! It is said that the
face is the index of the mind.
Let's go straight to Rama
studio and click a picture.
Munikanna looks so
handsome in these clothes.
We took his picture when he was six years
old and he was bed ridden for six months.
Let's plan things only after the wedding.
What is it, son?
Have you forgotten your keys?
-Yes.
Go and get them.
-Hey, Munikanna!
Even we forgot several
keys when we were young.
Some of them are not returned till now.
My key…
You wanted to see me again
under the pretext of a key?
Why an additional room now, Papa?
Let us buy a fan with the
money I saved. It will do.
Since your birth, has your father or uncle ever
thought of buying a fan even in scorching summer?
Now you mention fan because
you are getting a wife. Ok.
Mom! Who cares who is coming?
For me, my mother is most important.
Hey, Munikanna, you shouldn't say that.
Mother is most important for everyone.
But your wife is someone who
leaves everyone behind for you.
The way you take care of her is an indication
of how much you respect your mother.
Forget these things. Dismantle
that wall and put up a room.
Stay there along with your wife.
That's proper. Ok?
Why all that now, Papa?
Let us all stay together.
No, mom.
Wait. Have some.
Everything seems fine, now. You would see
sense in my advice once you are married.
Sundaramma! Shall I go to the field?
Ok.
Bujji, go to bed.
Hey, Munikanna!
-What is it, Papa?
While washing clothes, your
mom found two bidis in your pocket.
Even liquor is less harmful.
Bidi is dangerously hazardous
for health, Munikanna.
Hey! Who is it there?
Hey, Mallappa! Hasn't your father come?
He is not well. He is resting at home.
My farm is also here. Bear
that in mind while going.
As if we would enter your
fields and be unfair to your kids?
We just wanted to see our
previous farm and came this side.
Hear, uncle! Forget me and take
care of the pigs ravaging the farms.
That's why I sleep here
along with kids at night.
Take care while you go.
How did you know his dad didn't
come without even looking, Papa?
He always wears those
slippers made of tire.
They go plop-plop when he walks.
I didn't hear it now.
They are nomadic thieves
And you advise them to go carefully.
Why are you bothered?
Don't speak like an adult.
You need to grow up before
distinguishing right from wrong.
You don't have to grow
up to know right from wrong.
Your uncle should be blamed.
He has spoilt you with all his doting.
If you were proper, why would
Uncle have to dote on me?
Papa!...What is this?
Hey! Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey!
Are you angry?
Hey, Sinnabba!
-Have I said something wrong?
Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey, Munikanna! Call him back.
Sinnabba! Hold on!
I am going home.
He always beats me.
Hey! After all he is our father.
Brother!
What is it?
Pig!
Wait.
Papa!
Pig!
Hey! Take care of Sinnabba.
Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey, Munikanna!
Spear!
Papa...
Papa, let me go. Let go of me, Papa.
-Take him home.
Come on.
You put up a fence across the path
we have been using for generations.
And then you electrified it.
Our dog died because of it.
How many more lives-
Hey, we electrified the fence
so that you won't cross over.
What do you mean?
Do you want to kill us?
Answer my question, man!
As if we have no other job!
Why should we announce to
everyone not to go that side?
That farm belongs to us.
We will pass electricity through
it or run a path to the cemetery.
It's our wish. No one here
is qualified to question us.
In that case, we'ii remove the electric fence,
and no one is qualified to question us either.
Hey, elders are around
to discuss such issues.
Don't talk.
Narappa!
I didn't electrify it without reason.
I didn't do it on public property.
I have done it on the
land I bought legally.
Forty acres of farmland! How can I
simply watch wild pigs destroying it?
But how does that license you to kill
even humans?
For me, my crop is the priority.
And I will protect it with electricity.
What do I care whether
a dog dies or a man dies?
They are ready for a quarrel.
Master! He has displaced
all the fence posts!
We have to set them up again.
They would always stand with
folded hands frightened of us.
How did they become so
fearless after the arbitration?
Who could have done this over night?
Narappa's elder son has done it all.
He is very head strong.
Hmm.
How did you finish such a
huge job in the blink of an eye?
Brother-in-law! How much life you
must have seen through experience!
It takes a lot of effort to build
something, not for demolishing it.
I dislodged them within five minutes.
You are never short of arrogance!
If this fence was removed earlier, would Gundamma's
daughter die on the way to hospital with snake bite?
What do you expect me to do?
I expect you to appreciate your son.
You should be blamed first of all.
If they slap a police case, who
will take responsibility, man?
If they want to go to
the police, let them go.
Police will arrest him first.
Why would they ignore
electrifying the fence?
Just because I was keeping mum-
Otherwise? Mad creature!
You and your crazy talk!
Your father has no other job
- He talks as if he knows everything.
Such things happen only in films.
In real world, the rich
man has the upper hand.
Oh, ok. Fine, fine.
With the same opinion,
Pandusami puffs out his chest and
bosses over everyone in the village.
What do you say?
Now a sound message is sent
to him that no one is afraid of him!
Be proud, brother-in-law!
Hey, get going.
Your affinity encourages his audacity.
First put a stop to that.
If you continue to confront them
this way, they know only one thing.
They can do anything.
And do we fiddle away
while they do something?
Those days are gone.
If we follow you, we can only stand with folded
hands, bowed heads and accept what is given.
Who would care to give us what we want?
We should strike them and claim it, right?
I don't know why people are dead scared!
Hey, eat something and go!
I will have it later, mom!
I am not sure whether to
be afraid for him or be proud.
I must protect him on all counts.
So, haven't you gone to school?
Will the time wait for you?
I won't go.
-Why?
What 'why'? Ramu is dead, isn't he?
What if Ramu is dead?
-Sinnabba!
Are you the only one affected by Ramu's
death?
Everyone at home feels as sad.
If Ramu is gone, Mani is still with us.
Isn't that enough?
Mom! When I am grieving for Ramu
how can you say Mani is enough?
Will you suffice with me if brother
dies and with sister if I too die?
Why do you glare? He was supposed to
be on brother's side, right?
But he spoke in their support.
And then he claims to be
the man of the house.
That's wrong, Sinnabba.
You shouldn't speak rudely to elders.
Hey, don't take to heart what
Sinnabba spoke out of childishness.
He is sad that the dog died.
I am thankful that only the dog died.
Hey, what are you up to? Huh?
Can't you see? We are watering the fields.
This is just a draw-well.
If you pump up water using a motor, will
there be any water left for our fields?
Hey, what is that
useless altercation there?
Just do your job!
If you don't turn off the motor now,
I am going to dump it in the well.
Here comes lady boss.
So you order us around and expect us to obey?
Hey, do your job.
Let's see how she would
lay hands on the motor.
Lady! What are you trying to do?
Hey! Get lost!
Sinnabba! Call Munikanna here.
Brother!
Do it! Slit his throat.
What do I care if he dies? Bloody!
Hey!
How dare you hit my mother!
Mom, mom, mom! No, mom!
-Let go, man! Let go!
Mom, no!
Mom! Brother will take care. Don't!
Sinnabba! Let go of me!
-Mom! I said no.
Leave it, mom. Let it be.
Let it go, mom.
How dare you hit my mom.
Why did you tell mom
that I go out only to smoke?
You and smoke?
I never knew till now
that you smoked at all.
Uncle, give me a bidi.
Ok, keep watch in case someone comes.
Hmm. Ok.
Look there. Look...
Hey, is your father's name Narappa?
Yes.
Sir has sent for you. Come.
Why?
What, man? Won't you
follow unless I tell you why?
I am asking you why.
You will know why. Come here.
Hey, Sinnabba! Go home.
Hand off! I am coming along, right?
-Don't talk too much. Just come.
He talks a lot. Throw him inside.
-Come on!
I am coming. I said hands off!
-Get in first.
The police picked up my
son because you asked them.
Please tell them to release him.
Your son had bashed my
son in front of everyone...
...and you expect me to do
nothing but bring him home?
You have employed your men to pump water with a
motor from the well where oxen used to draw earlier.
Won't our crops die, Master?
But we have exclusive
rights on the well, Sattenna.
When we divided the field
between us and Madanna,
It was decided we both share the right to the path
as well as the well and you all are aware of it.
You bought Madanna's field
and put up a fence around it.
We thought at least we should stick to the agreement
and allowed you to draw water from the well.
But you..
-Hey!
What is that useless gossip there?
Gallivants! Go away!
He allowed me to draw water he says!
But then when they were using up the water,
He couldn't stay quiet.
He would interfere, right?
Let him interfere. Who stopped him?
But how can he lay hands on my son?
My son hit him for pushing his mother down.
How can that be wrong, Sir?
What is this, Pandusami?
Did your son hit his mother?
How come you never told us this, Sami?
Would you let it pass, if the
ladies of your home are beaten?
Sattenna! He has hit her in a fit of rage.
Forget it.
This clash is because of the field, right?
Ask him how much he wants. I will pay him.
Let him register it in my name.
How can you say that, Pandusami?
What is the connection
between this issue and his field?
If he hands over the farm,
I will get his son released.
I am insulted. He hit my son.
Look, Pandusami! How is this fair?
A little less or more, ask him to
quote his price and I will pay it.
Narappa! There is no profit from farming.
He is offering you money.
Write it in his name.
That farm was gifted to
my wife by her brother.
I only take care of it. That's all.
Hey, which is more important?
Your son or the farm?
Consult your brother-in-law
and he will tell you.
Get your son released
first without a record.
You can always buy a farm some day. So?
That farm legally belongs
to my kids after my wife.
Except that, I shall obey any other decision
you make and stay committed to the judgement.
Narappa promises his commitment
to the decision. Do the same, brother.
What is this, Pandusami?
What does it mean walking out in
silence? Why did you call us here then?
You could have decided it between you.
Ok, Sattenna.
I shall commit myself too to your decision.
Papa!
That useless brat has hit me, Papa.
Will you go by their words
and free him from jail?
Panchayat Board elections are close by.
We cannot win without the
support of their community.
Narappa! What do you say?
Will you be responsible
for my son's life until then?
Would we simply watch if
something happens to your son?
Let the elections be over.
We will burn these *** on a stake.
Bloody! How dare they resort to this!
Pandusami! Are you ok with this?
Will you obey the judgement?
Didn't I already say I would?
You keep rephrasing the same question!
You will stay loyal but what
about your son and your brother?
They will obey my word.
Narappa,
Pandusami says he will obey our verdict.
You also come up with a proposal to save your
son's life, without taking it as an affront.
You know the people of this village.
Hmm.
Why are you sending a young boy?
Isn't this wrong?
Sattenna, he is the one who
was humiliated. Don't interfere.
Narappa fell at his feet as promised.
Talk to the police and
get his son released, Sami.
How can we free him right now?
Ask him to touch
everyone's feet in the village.
Yo! You are committing a grave mistake.
We can say nothing further.
We are forced to witness
what he is doing.
Hey, lady! Don't you
even consider the age gap?
Are there no adults in the family?
He is the only man in the house.
Ask him to touch his feet and go.
No, brother, no.
Manga! Get some water.
No one dare speak against
their atrocities, brother.
Your son will come home safe.
Mom!
How could you fall at everyone's feet because
they asked you to? Aren't you ashamed?
Why don't you speak?
The respect my brother and you have earned over
the years, you have thrown it into the gutter.
If something happens to the boy,
what will we do with all this honour?
We should save our son's life, right?
Did anyone say where our son is?
He is kept at the station.
My brother went to bring him.
He will be here. Get up.
Sinnabba, come on.
Don't inform Munikanna of all this.
As if he wouldn't know unless we tell him.
Hey, why didn't you go to school?
Of course. School is
open at six in the evening.
You are drunk and you
pretend as if you care.
Look at yourself!
Who got drunk?
-Mom! I am leaving.
Don't be upset. Munikanna will come back.
-Ah, he will. He will.
Hey, nephew!
Hold on!
Slowly! Slowly!
-Oh! What happened?
Munikanna! What's wrong?
It's nothing, mom!
-What happened, brother?
Why is his face so swollen?
What happened?
-I said nothing.
Let go, uncle I will go by myself.
-Hey, wait! We are trying to help you.
Sundaramma! Get some turmeric
and hot water.
Let us give him some fomentation.
Careful!
Hey, Munikanna!
Did they beat you, son?
Did they?
Not much, Papa.
I know what all they
do at the police station.
Hey, Munikanna!
Your father couldn't
do anything for you, son!
I hit his son in front of
everyone and humiliated him.
If he doesn't react even this much,
what sort of father would he be?
It's ok, papa. I'm back now.
You should be careful, son!
I have been careful, father.
Yo.
Huh?
He is puking. Take care.
Ok. Coming.
Hey, Sinnabba! What are you doing there?
Come and pour water with the pot.
I knew he would make a
mess in the center of the house.
Let me clean it.
-No! I will clean it.
Hey, Munikanna!
You bashed up all the idiots
who pushed mom, right?
In the same way, I was so angry I wanted to hack to
death all those who took you to the police station.
But how come this man manages
to survive without passion?
Do you know what great act he
performed before he came home to sleep?
Pandusami said he would get you released
only if Papa touches everyone's feet.
He fell at everyone's feet in
the village and came home.
Papa!
Is it true what Sinnabba says?
Tell me, Papa. Is it true?
How has he done?
-He has done very well, Sir.
Keep watching. One day, that
youngster will turn into a great man.
What is it?
-Can I go for a movie?
Go.
[Hums a song]
I struck your son.
You got me beaten by the police.
That settled the score, right?
Why did you bloody ask my
father to fall at everyone's feet?
Hey, Subbadasu!
Why call only him?
If you have any shame left,
Call your wife, your kids,
your servants and everyone else.
Call them and tell
them that I have hit you.
Dirty!
How did you make my father fall at
the feet of the entire village?
Bloody!
Go and tell them-
That Narappa's son hit you with a slipper.
After all you should remember
this as long as you are alive.
Hear, husband!
Coming!
I am calling you for a meal and
what are you doing over there?
Didn't I say I am coming?
What happened, brother?
Why are you preoccupied these days?
When the mind is disturbed,
how can man be relaxed?
He hit Rangababu and
while he walks around proudly,
-should we simply spare him?
You made Narappa fall at everyone's feet.
You got his son bashed
up in the police station.
I forgot he has beaten me.
Why do you keep thinking of it and...
-Dense bugger!
We know they won't spare if
we touch them but decapitate us.
So we kept quiet and
now it has come this far.
If I hacked him to death on the same day,
I would have proudly
carried on with the case.
You left him then.
You got slapped by his slipper
and brought it this far now.
Why do you rattle your brains?
Tell me what is to be done.
His family shouldn't even
find his dead body to cry over.
His death should be lonesome.
Break his head into pieces and
burn them in the coal furnace.
You could have taken me along, brother. I would
have watched you hit Pandusami with a slipper.
Hey, Sinnabba! Don't you
mention this to uncle or father!
No one should hear of it. Ok?
Did you really hit him with a slipper?
Then? Why would I be quiet
if they meddle with father?
Why keep this a secret?
Why don't we tell everyone?
You should control your tongue. Ok?
Brother! Brother!
Brother!
Hey, let go of him, man!
Brother!
Let go!
-Brother!
Bend him!
Brother! No!
Sinnabba! Go!
Sinnabba! Run!
Hold him tight!
Go!
Papa!
Papa!
It was here, Papa!
Papa!
Uncle! It was here, uncle.
Uncle! It was here, uncle.
Uncle! It was here, uncle.
Brother…right here…was writhing!
Hey, Sinnabba! Get up.
I can't understand a word.
I am telling you the truth, uncle.
It was here, uncle. It was here…
-Hey!
It was here, Uncle!
Hey, Munikanna!
They dragged him to the
other side of the tree, Uncle.
A lot of them attacked brother and...
Go that side.
Hey, look behind the hill too.
-You look in Madanna's field.
Okay Narappa..
Hey, run!
Hey, go to the edge and look.
Go look around Akkamma's shop.
Ok, Uncle.
Hey, get up.
Tell me where actually your brother went.
Both of you are hiding
something.
Tell me the truth.
-It is true, Papa.
Why would I lie to you?
It was here that brother was pushed.
He fell down here.
He fell down here, Papa.
It is true, Papa.
He fell down right here.
There! You can see the mark of mud here.
He fell in the mud right here, Papa.
He fell down right here in the mud, Papa.
Brother!
Narappa! Do you think
Pandusami has done this?
We shouldn't think on
those lines, brother-in-law.
We shouldn't come to a hasty conclusion.
Probably these two have done something and
are hiding it from us for fear.
Hey, Munikanna!
Here, Papa. It was here, Papa!
They tied brother to a
rope and pulled him up.
It was here, Uncle. It was here.
What, man? Is your son a
newborn baby to have been abducted?
He roams around the village beating
someone or the other.
Who will abduct him?
By the way, who saw it?
It's him. He is the one, Sir.
His brother.
Hey! Tell me the truth, boy.
Didn't your brother elope with someone?
No, Sir.
Sir,
we recently settled a match for him.
Yo! Have you come here
to lodge a complaint on this?
You say his wedding is fixed.
Go and look for him in the bride's village.
He must be there.
Go on, men.
I am sure he will come back in a
few days after impregnating her.
We came to you fearing
the worst for my son.
Why don't you at least file a case, Sir?
File a missing case, man.
Why are you sitting here
so early in the morning?
I woke up suddenly, mom.
Your brother didn't come home last night.
Where is your father?
-Uncle has come and taken him,
Sir! This side!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Come this way, Sir.
Over there, Sir.
Leave me!
Oh, no! Munikanna!
Dear! Sundarama! Get up, dear!
Sundaramma! Get up.
Where is the face?
Where is the face?
This is not my son.
Listen to me. This is not my son.
They have brought
someone and say it's my son.
Sir, please look elsewhere, Sir!
This is not my son...
Brother! Brother!
This is not my son, brother.
Please tell me, brother.
This is not my son.
This is not your nephew, brother.
This is not my son, dear.
At least you tell them this is not my son.
Brother!
-Dear?
Brother, he is capable of handling
any number of men by himself.
How would he die, brother?
This can't be my son, brother.
Mom, mom! Brother.
This is not my son.
This is not my son.
This is not my son!
Don't cry dear, don't cry.
Hey! Send them out.
Give her some water to drink.
Sir, we came to you
the day he went missing.
Now we found his
body at the coal furnace.
Definitely, they were
behind his death, Sir.
Hey! Don't blurt out
things without knowing.
Lady! First, drink some water.
Your boy missing is one case.
Finding an unidentified
body is another case.
These are two different cases.
Sir! Why do you talk about two cases?
I want my son!
-Yes.
If the head is missing, it's a case of an unidentified
body in the police records until it is found.
Tell them to bring my son home!
-Yo! Check the phone.
My son!
Let's see. We might find
the head in two or three days.
If not, it has been eaten
by some dog or fox.
Oh, no! My son! Please don't say that.
In which case there is
nothing you and I can do.
Pandusami…
Tell him I will speak to him.
I want my son!
Sir! We stand before you with a son lost.
We hoped to see him get married.
At least to bid him farewell,
please return him to us.
It's not possible.
Law doesn't allow.
“Watch how a mother's heart is bleeding”
Papa! No, Papa.
You shouldn't keep these.
-It's ok, Papa. Let them be.
“My sweet baby! Please come back to me”
“Why did you step out of
the womb on to this earth?”
"You didn't even stay long enough to cuddle!"
I thought Munikanna has called me.
Ok. Go in and sleep.
"Where did you disappear so quick?"
“In the evil darkness I wonder
what curse has touched you!”
Sundaramma! Where are you going?
Munikanna may be at the temple.
If he is at the temple,
he will come by himself.
Why do you want the
kids to roam in the sun? Go home.
Go home with sister, mom.
I will go and check.
Let me also check. I would feel
nice if I see him with my own eyes.
I want to look for him.
-Let's go, mom.
I said I want to look for him there! Come.
Did you see at the temple?
-I did, mom.
What about that shop there?
-I checked, mom.
Brother-in-law! Get up!
Hey, Munikanna!
What is this?
-How can he come?
They made a sacrifice of him altogether.
Sit down.
Son!
Being a man if you break down
this way, how can a woman handle it?
Kids will be traumatized, brother-in-law.
What happened, brother?
Nothing, dear.
I didn't even allow a picture to be
taken saying his life span will be reduced.
I already forgot my son's smell.
In a few days, I will forget even his face.
There is no curse for parents worse than
to live forgetting the face of their kids!
There is not, brother-in-law!
“The sweat of your toil is still fresh Feel with
your hands this entire orchard” Mom! Let us go.
“Our home is subdued with your missing smiles”
What are they doing here?
We should conduct the
rituals for the departed, dear.
How can you decide that my son is dead?
Do you have any sense? Look here.
-Why do you shout?
My nephew is dead.
Brother-in-law!
Whether you are able to
accept it or not,
-that is the truth.
If that is the truth, what the heck
did you two do that you stand here?
Isn't the man who killed
my son roaming free?
Let Pandusami be lifted on a
bier and let his ceremony be held.
And then get these god
damned rituals done here. - Sundaramma!
For a year I have been watching my sister's
anguish and I cannot take it, brother-in-law.
Unless we eliminate that family,
I don't think this anguish can subside.
We cannot afford to lose the
living for the sake of the dead.
Fury doesn't work everywhere.
We have Sundaramma.
There is Sinnabba.
And there is Bujjamma
who is yet to discover world.
But my sister weeps
every day, brother-in-law.
Time is the solution for
everything, brother-in-law.
“Watch how a mother's heart is bleeding”
Mom!
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Brother, I am very hungry.
Why don't you eat?
Mother didn't cook even today.
I want this, brother.
-Give me that.
Let's go.
Uncle!
What is it, boy?
I will drop sister at her school.
Where is your bag?
Aren't you going to school?
Papa drinks through the day.
Mom keeps weeping for brother.
You are on your way to work.
Who will look after my
sister if I go to school?
“My tear filled eyes blur your image
Will the pain in my heart show you clear?”
Sinnabba! Get up.
Go to Ramaiah uncle's shop and get sesame, rice
flour, meadow grass and whatever else is required.
What for now, mom?
Your brother is dead.
He won't come back.
We should offer all these to
your brother and pay homage.
“Not even a leaf wants to move-
Take a look”
“Unless you come,
there is no air to breathe, sweetheart”
“Watch how a mother's heart is bleeding”
Mom!
Can I lie down in your lap for a while?
Hmm.
"My sweet baby! Please come back to me"
It's all very sad without
brother, isn't it Mom?
“Why did you step out of
the womb on to this earth?”
How painfully the kid must have died!
“Where did you disappear so quick?”
It feels as if he is still
moving around here.
“In the evil darkness I wonder
what curse has touched you!”
“You have become lonely, my sweetheart!”
Hey, where are you going?
Mom, I will go to Ramanji's
house and be back.
Why don't you go tomorrow morning?
He is going away to
Anantpur hostel tomorrow.
Let me go and see him, mom.
Hmm. Ok.
Hey, Mani! Don't trouble
mom in my absence. Ok?
What is it? What did you keep in the bag?
Nothing, mom.
Don't you hear me? What is inside?
-I said there is nothing.
Husband, Sinnabba is not to be seen.
Have you seen him?
He must have gone to some friend's house.
Listen! He told me
he was going to meet Ramanji.
When I enquired, Ramanji seemed
to have left for the hostel two days ago.
Wherever he goes,
he always takes his dog along.
Now he has tied her up.
He was swinging a bag while going.
I am worried he might have
made some hand bombs.
Don't fret, dear.
Let me go and get him.
We better decide something
about that cement factory, Papa.
It will happen.
Don't be in a hurry.
It takes time.
-That engineer is on tenterhooks.
Ok, Papa.
Hey, are you hungry?
Come and have some food.
-No, no! No.
Hey! I will pay for you.
Hey! Have you seen Sinnabba?
I saw him by the lake. Go and look there.
For three generations we have
been slogging on this rice mill.
Let's start the cement factory.
Let us employ these rascals and make
sure they are always under our control.
Support from gentlemen like
you will be a great advantage.
This is not one man's decision. Let us
discuss with the others and get back to you.
Ok.
-Let's see what they will say.
Return this soda bottle in the
shop and come back quickly.
Ok, Sir.
Madam told me to ask
you about the sofa set-
Let's discuss that tomorrow.
Is this the time? Go.
-Ok, Sir.
What, man! Are you sleeping? Get up.
Sinnabba!
Sir! They have hacked our Master.
Some kid has killed Pandusami
and is running away. Catch him!
Master!
Hey, he is not able to breathe.
Subbadasu! Move back!
He is not breathing! Hey, call the police!
Why have you come back alone?
Where is he?
Your son has brought our
entire family to the street.
What happened, husband? Wh…
-Wake up Bujji.
But what has happened?
-I told you to first wake the little one up!
Hey, brother-in-law! Brother-in-law!
Pack all your clothes.
But why?
Where are the farm
papers? Are they in the trunk?
What happened? Why don't you tell me?
What happened, Narappa?
I have been asking the same.
What happened?
Your son has hacked Pandusami to death!
He was loitering here the whole evening?!
What do I know, brother-in-law?
She told me and I went looking for him.
As soon as I stepped in to the village,
I saw him running with a
dagger to strike Pandusami.
Pandusami has already seen him come.
His people were just leaving.
I didn't know what to do.
I broke the street lamp with a branch.
Before I could even think, it was all over.
As if this was not enough, he threw a
crude bomb at those who were chasing him.
Probably he made it ready earlier.
And we took him for a
mere school going boy.
Dear! Where is the jewelry?
They are in the grain pot.
Where?
-The big one.
Life…was it gone?
I swear, brother-in-law! Pandusami
must have definitely lost his life.
It wasn't a normal blow this boy gave him.
His arm came loose with one strike.
As far as I know, his rib
cage must have been broken.
Hey, nephew!
What we couldn't do for you,
your little brother has done it.
Sundaramma!
Pandusami has lost his life
on the same day your son died.
God exists! God does exist!
If either of you has done this job,
I would have been happy.
I would have killed all the goats we have
and thrown a party to the entire village.
My son's life is ruined.
Two men at home have conveniently
turned a child into a murderer.
We can't waste time now talking.
Who will save him now?
Dear! Bujjamma! Get up.
-Yo! This is not the time to mull over all that.
Hey!
Hey!
What's with you?
Where were you till now?
What were you doing?
I did nothing, Uncle.
I went to Ramanji's house,
met him and am here.
And you want me to buy that?
Why do you need a knife
to go to Ramanji's house?
Look at your shirt. What did you do? Huh?
I should hit you, idiot!
Bloody idiot! Useless tramp!
Hey! Sinnabba, go inside.
If he had thought about
his sister, would he do that?
I have thought it all out.
No one needs to be concerned about me.
I can take care of myself.
I just wanted to see my mom before leaving.
Look at him talk!
We are dying here every
moment and you have... Bloody fool!
How can you beat a kid?
Sundaramma! Take him inside.
He has done such a terrible
thing and how can he still be a kid?
What is the point in
beating him? Come here.
Why did you do it?
I couldn't bear your pain, mom.
You grieve every single day.
How will your pain subside?
That's why I killed him.
But how can we protect you now?
If something happened to him?
He is my only son now.
What is his age to go to prison?
He has suddenly done such a big thing.
Narappa!
Take Sinnabba and go to the forest.
I will go to Muthanna's with
Sundaramma and the girl.
With the police on one hand and Pandusami's
men on the other waiting to kill Sinnabba,
Narappa is contemplating
on how to save his son.
If he comes to know we have hunted
this, that might demand a share.
Do you hear that?
Gampi has caught something.
Make it into pieces and bring them.
Hey, Gampi!
Ha?
Pandusami is killed.
Who would dare do that?
A boy from the same village.
His drunken father has
taken him into the forest.
I promised Pandusami's men
that I will bring him by morning.
You can leave. I will take care.
There are no traces of
their climbing up, brother.
Could they have gone down this way?
It is no drunkard who
took his son to the forest.
He knows this jungle thoroughly.
Keep the knife by your head and sleep.
I already have one. Why this?
Keep this.
You have already hacked someone with that.
It must have lost its sharpness.
Pass that to me.
If you are afraid, just call me.
I am close by.
Don't shout.
I will lie down there. If
necessary, throw a stone. Ok?
Huh?
-Ok, Papa.
Hey!
It seems they have spread a mat
right here and had a good meal, brother.
I guess he realized we are on his trail.
It's difficult to search this way.
Akulappa! You belong to his village.
Bring his dog here.
Walk slowly, Papa. My feet are hurting.
I asked you to wear slippers but you didn't.
Go and sit there.
Go.
It's very cold, isn't it?
I came here one day
with Brother to collect honey.
Remember I brought bee hive to the
farm the other day?
We got it from here.
Brother would tie a rope to a
boulder and slide down in no time.
No one can be as brave as him.
Today it feels exactly the same.
The same breeze; the same boulder.
The same bee hive,
Only brother is missing.
Ok, go to sleep.
Keep the knife by your head.
I wonder how a cattleman has so much jewelry!
Beat them black and blue and the truth will
be out on each one's hideout, Subbadasu.
Sundaramma!
Pandusami's men have caught the scent.
You should escape before
they reach here, dear.
If you are caught, they
will beat you to death.
In that case, we will...
-Don't tell us where you are going, dear.
They would beat even
women to extract information.
We might blurt out truth in pain.
Take Bujjamma and leave immediately.
Leave soon, dear.
-Get up, Bujjamma.
Careful, dear. Careful!
Watch out.
-Go ahead. Please be careful.
Hey, Muthaiah! You can't afford a meal
unless you work at the coal furnace! You!
Didn't Uncle ask us to stay here, Mom?
Where are we going now?
-I will tell you. Come along.
It's me.
Didn't I tell you to keep the
knife handy by your head?
Take it.
Who's going to bring that?
Huh.
Come.
Papa, Bujjamma likes ice apples a lot.
Shall I go pluck some?
First meet your uncle.
You can get them later.
Uncle!
Hey, nephew!
Come. Come here, precious! Come here.
Hey, give that here. You said you want
to bring something for your sister, right?
Go and get it.
Whom did they involve in the case?
Who else, Narappa?
You and Sinnabba.
Surprisingly they have spared
me and I don't know why.
There must be something
behind it, brother-in-law.
If they involve you, how
would they know about us?
Otherwise, how long would it
take for them to cut you into pieces?
Did they take Pandusami's
corpse from there?
They took him overnight.
What did they mention in the case filed?
You had sent Sinnabba ahead
to find out where Pandusami was.
Then you went to their village, threatened them
while they were in the cement factory meeting
And snatched everything they had on them.
In the altercation that followed
you stabbed Pandusami and...
when they tried to catch you,
Sinnabba threw a bomb
and you both had fled.
That's the story they cooked.
Nothing new.
They will never accept we killed them
for defending our lives or self-respect.
They don't want to give us that credit.
So they label us thieves
and demean us further.
Uncle!
Uncle, give these to my
sister. She is very fond of them.
Hey, Sinnabba, I hope no one has seen you.
-No, Papa.
Ok, let's go.
Narappa,
I asked Muthappa to hand over the money
to you at milestone number 117. Collect it.
I am going to Tirupati to
meet Lawyer Varadarajulu.
He seemed to have gone somewhere.
But I will somehow catch hold of him.
Ok. Be careful.
Papa, why are we both
circling the jungle ready to run?
What mistake did we make?
The police should have
arrested Pansudami that day.
Why are the police always in their favour?
Keep walking.
Even the police are
helpless before the rich.
They even greet them first.
If they didn't harm my brother,
we wouldn't be roaming like this.
Hey!
I will break your jaw!
Useless talk!
Go on!
Hey, I must go meet Uncle Muthanna
and come back.
Can you stay here safe till then?
You speak as if this forest is new to me!
Who said you are new to the forest?
For whatever you did, hiding in the forest is new.
Hey, come here. Come on!
Stay put here. I will be back.
This place belongs to someone I know.
Don't wander around the way you
do in the village and get on to the road.
Do you understand?
-Ok, Papa.
[Visit FilmyBRO.COM]
Brother! Brother! I have been waiting for
you the whole night in the forest, brother.
Last night Subbadasu and his men came home,
...bashed mom and dad and
threw everything out, brother.
Did they hit even women?
-Yes, brother.
They didn't spare even women.
We admitted them in the hospital, brother.
Sundaramma?
When Uncle Muthanna saw the men
coming, he sent her away quietly, brother.
But I don't know where
they went or where they are.
Uncle Muthanna felt bad
he couldn't protect them, brother.
He asked you to forgive him.
I should ask your forgiveness
for involving you in this mess.
You have given us shelter in need and please
inform Uncle that I am forever indebted for that.
Why say that when we are one family,
brother? Please, take care of yourself.
“The hamlet has turned into a jungle
There seems no path in sight”
“Who would guide me to you?
Can I ever set my eyes on you?”
“Time keeps chasing
And even light is piercing”
“My heart has become heavy
But feet are on an endless journey”
Come on, man!
Sinnabba!
Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey!
Sinnabba!
Hey!
Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey!
Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey!
Hey! You…
Papa! Come on!
Come here and check.
It's a wild rabbit. I caught it myself.
Senseless idiot!
Didn't I ask you to stay there?
You came here and to signal our location to
the world you have started a fire, scoundrel!
As if I could have caught
this rabbit sitting there!
I should thrash you, swine!
Are you going to die if
you don't eat for a day?
Muthanna is hospitalized along
with his family for your sake!
No one knows where your
mom has found shelter!
You have been roaming like a vagabond here!
Useless idiot!
Look! Don't raise your hand
with every word you speak!
I had already told you I
would take care of myself.
It's not too late even now.
You can mind your business.
What I need I have prepared
them myself and got them.
Hey!
Your bother also blabbered
the same way and invited death.
If you continue the blabber
and risk your life how can we...
Not a word about me
- Hey! Put that down first!
You display all your rage only on me!
Do you think brother didn't react when
Pandusami made you touch everyone's feet?
He went and hit him with a slipper!
Unlike you licking others' feet,
-he would have broken the legs
of those who asked him to do it.
I wish you died instead of my brother.
We would have been at peace.
Hey!
Sinnabba!
I think it has picked up the scent.
Let it go.
Hey, Mani! Come here.
How did you come here, bud?
Who brought you?
Hey!
Kill this guy, first.
Papa!
Papa, leave me! Leave me, Papa!
Let me go, Papa. Let go of me!
-Hey, you! Move!
Papa, he is the one who killed my brother!
Papa!
I don't want my family to be
helpless. That's why I spare you.
But if you touch my son again,
not a single one of you will stay alive.
Probably you think I have spared
the man who killed your brother.
I wanted to chop that into pieces!
But I had lost most
valuable things to anger.
You know your Papa only
as a drunkard and a father.
There was a great demand for
my liquor in the surrounding areas.
My boss used to earn more
than all other liquor merchants.
Though it was wrong to make liquor,
there was no better option for survival then.
This is my boss Sankaraiah.
He listens to whatever I say.
He would appoint or
dismiss people on my word.
Who is that?
He has been asking for
work for many days, Sir.
He wants to work for you at any cost.
He says he is highly educated, Sir.
To count the number of liquor pots sold,
the amount of jaggery, number of hog plums-
-I felt an educated clerk
would be very useful.
He may be educated but how
can we employ a stranger, man?
He hails from the same
village as young master's wife.
If you enquire a little deep, he
would be some way related to you.
He says he can't even afford to eat.
Why don't we allot him at
least house hold chores?
Ok.
Watch his work for two months.
Ok, Sir.
Hey, Seena! You have got
the job as soon as you asked.
Boss has consented immediately.
But always remember one thing.
Once on duty, don't become arrogant because
you are the most educated in the mill.
Get it?
You gave me work and ensured proper
meals for my wife and kids, Narappa.
You saved them from starvation. I will
never forget your kindness, Narappa.
I will come back for lunch, mom.
-Ok, dear.
Hey, why are you doing this job?
Why not, Sir? I would
do anything for you, Sir.
There will be a meeting in the
Collector's office in two days anyway.
Ask him to come directly. Ok?
-Ok, Sir.
Greetings, Sir.
Hey, wear a shirt!
Ok, Sir.
Hey, what is this?
How can you walk about shirtless
when there are girls around?
Why wouldn't I wear, if I had one, Madam?
If brother has an old
shirt, please give it to me.
He wears trousers and shirts.
Let me also wear
trousers and shirts, madam.
Over there. Look up. That side.
Greetings, Sir!
I am making him clean, Sir.
He cleans well.
Find out if the Collector is back in town.
-Ok, Sir.
We should be mindful of our status.
If you confront a landlord,
is he going to stay quiet?
Look at you. They have
beaten you like a dog.
Why should we be victimized for
the benefit of a few rich people?
This is my elder brother, Muniappa.
He used to fight against
landlords and capitalists.
As long as his fight was for
the workers or their better wages,
capitalists never bothered about him.
Am I doing all this for my sake?
Yeah. Keep saying you work
for the welfare of the village.
The other day the family who came to see my
daughter for alliance heard about you and..
...they turned back
without even coming home.
Let them get lost, Sister.
I'll find a nice boy who works with me in
the Movement and get my niece married to him.
It's for this sort of talk that you
should be given a stronger beating.
If you get some useless guy for her,
should Kannamma too suffer like sister?
What is it, Narappa?
Your mouth has become big!
He is your elder brother
and yet you talk as you like!
Being the eldest, shouldn't
he be more responsible?
These women live depending on us.
Shouldn't we keep them in mind?
'When they started occupying lands
belonging to my people, my brother
along with Advocate Varadarajulu,
launched an agitation for their sake.
The capitalists could not stomach it.'
They say you have illegally occupied
2400 acres of land in the district.
What is this, Mr Collector?
They blabbered something and
clinging to it, you call us an insult us!
As if you gentlemen will respond to a
simple message!
Listen to the Collector.
Sir, we are born to rule for generations.
Why do we need the lands
of these useless people?
What did you guys rule over, huh?
You bloody...
-Hey!
Hey, Muneppa!
Sit down.
Why can't you sit and talk? Sit down.
You are gentlemen and what is all this?
They want clashes; not solution.
You react as soon as they provoke you!
Don't you understand?
Look. If you return their lands to them,
this dispute will find a closure.
Instead, if you move the court and the
government intervenes, you get nothing.
We run the government. You know.
When the same government has an
honest official, you know what can happen.
Sir, this is our hard earned land.
Yo! What hard work are you talking about?
For the money we borrowed from you for the
weddings of our kids or for health problems,
-you recorded it as though we
have sold lands to you, didn't you?
What does it matter
how we bought them, Sir?
We turned barren lands into fertile ones.
Who made them fertile?
Wasn't it these people again?
You have ruled as long as you could.
Enough now.
The present generation wants their
lands back. Return them. That is fair.
Our lands are equivalent to our lives, Sir.
We won't give them
even over our dead bodies.
Yo! First of all the land doesn't
belong to you and you talk of life.
This is not going to help.
Sir, we rather go to the
court and sort it there.
If you spare the lawyer,
he doesn't seem to rest until
he takes everything from us.
Hmm.
Hey, Narappa!
Sir!
Seshaih from Kuruvilavelli
has taken liquor for the fete.
He hasn't paid the money yet.
Go and get it.
Ok, Sir. Let us go, man.
'I didn't understand at that
moment why he had sent me away.'
Forget the lawyer, Sir.
He goes wherever he is called.
He came here because
our villagers called him.
First, find out who called him here.
Who else, brother? Narappa's
elder brother is behind all this.
How does it matter who?
There is a time for everything.
When the time comes, I will inform you
Be ready.
The movie is really good, I believe.
My neighbor Jyoti has told me.
Ask your uncle to get us tickets quickly.
Do you want a ticket too?
Then? Should I watch sitting in your lap?
-Ok, Stay right here.
Be right back.
Hey, Seena!
You have become fair within
two months of employment!
Wherever he goes,
boss seems to take you along.
He even promoted you to a clerk.
Very good!
What is that glare?
Why do you stare at me like that, huh?
Give me a rupee, man.
-I have no money!
Who asked you?
Note it in my name and give me.
How can I mix up mill
accounts with liquor accounts?
Hey, show your math and all
to the people working for you.
Kannamma is waiting
there. Give me the money.
I told you I can't.
Still you ask me!
I have seen lots of people
like you posing in front of girls.
You can't intimidate me.
Hey, you seem to have
forgotten where you came from.
That's not good for you.
I know for sure where I came from.
You are a sod living on what we throw.
How dare you stand before me and talk?
What the heck are you saying?
Sir!
-Hey!
Sir, he is hitting me, Sir.
-What is this, Narappa?
Wait, men!
-Sir!
What is this?
I am being soft on him
and he wags his tongue!
I would have killed him for what
he said at the collector's office.
I spared him out of respect for the boss.
You laid hands on me, didn't you?
I will teach you a lesson.
What will you do? What will you do?
Hey, Narappa!
-Dirty scoundrel!
Come here.
He refuses to give me just ONE rupee!
-Why are you so furious?
Hey, boy! If it was a rupee you
wanted, you could have asked me!
Why did you have to ask him?
Why is he made a clerk then?
Whatever you want, do ask me.
Here, keep these two rupees.
When I ask for money, whether
to give it or not is your prerogative.
Who is he to say 'no'?
But you were the one who brought him!
Narappa! Who are these
people between you and me?
Tell me now. Shall I
dismiss him from his job?
It's ok. Let him be here.
There. This goodness in you...
Check right now whether
you like the girl or not.
So what does the boy do?
Has none of you told them?
No. We didn't. Say it for yourself.
You must have heard of Sankaraiah's mill.
I am everything there.
What do you mean 'everything'?
His boss is a liquor baron.
Narappa is the reason why
his liquor is in such demand.
He is the secret behind its taste.
No one can beat him at it
in the surrounding districts.
If you take a sip, you won't let go
of it in your life.
Hey, who brought him here?
He blabbers witohut context!
He is doing it for the time being.
Once he is married, he will work
on the farm. You don't have to worry.
Though no government job, I wanted to give my
sister to a boy doing some honorable work.
I can't give my sister to a liquor maker and
then keep visiting police stations and courts.
I didn't like the girl.
My cousin had mentioned an alliance.
We must go and see the girl there.
Talk to me about match making
again, you will get it from me.
Aren't you ashamed to ask Uncle?
Doesn't it upset you when people
belittle Uncle in front of everyone?
Is there one person who dislikes Uncle?
You and your Uncle!
He keeps saying 'liquor maker'.
He will never be able to get married.
Because of him, you won't either.
Hey, say that again and I will kill you.
You should be pulled up, first.
Instead of giving your
daughter to your own brother,
you are screening villages
along with your old woman.
So, you think I would give you in marriage
to that hooligan and gift you my fate?
Hey, I won't even care that you are my mom.
What do you think of yourself?
I call him names and why are you so irked?
Of course, I am.
Instead of marrying some idiot like
you did and suffer, I would rather marry-
-a macho-man like uncle. I am ready
to become a widow yet live proudly.
Say that you will live
forever with your uncle.
Yeah. First get us married
and then I will live with him.
In your dreams!
Hey, Uncle!
Why are you sitting all alone?
If that girl rejects you, no one in
the world is more foolish than her.
Yeah...
You are the right one to praise me.
As usual take me to see some
alliance and then insult me.
But why do you tag along
here and there to see a girl?
Did it never cross your mind to marry me?
Why don't you marry me, Uncle?
I will take good care of you.
It feels strange all of a sudden, Uncle.
“O o o o, Narappa!”
“I am very fond of you!
My eyes widen as soon as I see you”
“O o o o, Kannamma!”
“I shall guard you like your eye lid,
I shall be your companion this whole life”
“Listen here to me,
Listen to what my heart says”
“List of desires unrolls and I wonder
what happens to my sense”
“It feels great, maiden, with your enchantment”
“You turned me into a nodding baby”
“A dazzling brilliance shines on us
Tempting the dream itself”
“O o o o, Narappa!”
“I am very fond of you!
My eyes widen as soon as I see you”
“O o o o, Kannamma!”
“I shall guard you like your eye lid,
I shall be your companion this whole life”
What is it?
Nothing. You carry on.
“Shall I visit the Bellary fair
And bring you a sack of peanuts?”
"If you really bring me the peanuts,
Won't offer you my life itself?"
“Shall we together visit the Kadiri temple?
Shall we get married in Madakasira?”
“Shall we set up a beautiful hut near the lake?”
Ouch!
Hey, Kannamma! There
are thorns all over. Be careful.
Not just her, thorns prick us too!
Come.
Ok. Go ahead.
What is it, bro? Why
have you come at this hour?
I want a pair of slippers made.
Why? Did your boss
forget them at his mistress'?
Why? Only boss can use footwear?
These are for Narappa's fiancée.
Yo! Why do you want to
do such senseless things?
I will decide what is necessary or not.
First, make them.
What about the measurement?
Huh?
If the measurement goes wrong, they
won't be comfortable to wear, brother.
Mea…mea…measurement means...
It will be this much.
Make them strong so that
no thorns will prick her. Ok?
Ok, brother.
They should feel soft
like cotton on the top.
They should be a little
dense underneath. Ok?
Ok, brother.
Listen. These slippers are for ladies.
So make the heels a little high.
Ok, ok.
Hear! When she wears them, they
should add beauty to her feet. Ok?
Yo! Then make them yourself, bro!
Ok, fine. Stitch them.
You yourself make them.
I tell you all this because you have no
idea how much Kannamma loves me.
I am giving her
something for the first time.
How beautiful they should be!
I understand, bro.
She should also know how much I love her.
Wear the slippers.
No thorns can prick you now.
Hey, Jyoti! Have you seen my new sandals?
Do you like them?
My Uncle got them made for me.
They are very beautiful!
“My eyes widen as soon as I see you”
“O o o o, Kannamma!”
“I shall guard you like your eye lid,
I shall be your companion this whole life”
Uncle! Uncle! Kannamma is crying.
Come soon, Uncle!
-What is it?
What happened?
Why? Why did you do this?
Your brother insists on self-reliance
and is sending her so far for tailoring.
And you…in spite of knowing we cannot
use footwear, you got her the sandals.
She wore them thinking
nothing would happen to her.
She may be out of her mind
because she is crazy about you.
Where was your sense? Where was it?
Now, you see. It is my
daughter who is suffering.
What has happened now, Sister?
It's our ill fate
to be born in our community!
Kannamma!
Ok, ok. It's nothing. Nothing.
Uncle!
So, you are wearing slippers?
Yes. My Uncle gave them to me.
Remove them.
Remove your slippers.
You strut around the village wearing
slippers, and you expect us to watch?
Remove the slippers!
If you like the slippers so much,
remove them yourself.
Will you remove the slippers
yourself or shall I pull your sari?
Brother, please don't beat her, brother.
Kannamma! Why the ruckus? Remove them.
Remove them!
Remove them, Kannamma.
Remove them and keep them on her head.
Why do you glare? You bloody!
Kannamma! Let's go, Kannamma.
Don't do this, Kannamma.
-Remove it.
Why should we do what he says?
Kannamma!
Let's ignore for this once.
Come!
It really hurts, Uncle!
It was very humiliating.
No, brother. Please, let her go.
We will go away.
Who is 'brother'?
Am I your brother?
Remove them!
Remove them and put them on her head.
Put them on her head.
(Sobs)
Kannamma! Everyone is watching,
Let us go, please.
Kannamma! Let us go!
Walk!
Carry them on your head!
I didn't cry before him, Uncle.
Even now I am not crying about his beating.
So many of them were
watching it like a show
but not one questioned him
why he was beating me, Uncle!
Bloody!
But how arrogant he was
to beat me Uncle?
That day you were laughing
because your Uncle had beaten me!
Brother, please don't beat her.
We will never wear slippers again.
I asked you to remove your sandals and you
say I should remove them if I want. Huh?
Bring them!
Put them on your head and walk!
Until you are out of the village,
the slippers should be on your head!
All the people were watching it all, Uncle.
How can I enter the village again?
Pick it up, man!
Pick up the slipper, man!
You carry on.
What did you say?
-No!
That you will beat if she wears slippers?
-Don't!
No! No, Narappa!
I am wearing them now.
Will you beat me?
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me, man!
Hit me! Hit me!
No,
- Hit me!
Don't come to me.
Hey, bring Kannamma here.
No, Narappa!
Hit him, hit him!
Hey, untie him first.
What is it? What is happening here?
They have beaten a girl, Sir.
Didn't I ask you to tell
me whatever happens?
First ask him what happened.
I don't care what the hell happened.
Whatever happened, weren't you
supposed to come to the mill and inform me?
Take everyone else if you want.
He will be here for sure.
Kannamma is coming here.
Only after he apologizes,
he will be let off.
Rascal!
Give you an inch, you
take a mile. Don't you?
He made a girl go round the
village with slippers on her head.
Instead of calling it wrong,
why do you slap me, Master?
Hey! Making your fiancée go round
the village carrying slippers on her head
and striking my person with a slipper
in public! How are they both same?
What about you all? He was bashing our men
and you simply watched without killing him?
'No matter how loyal I was,
what was I in the eyes of my boss?
I understood that day how
much he looked down upon me.'
If you send children to
school, they beat you.
If you draw water from the
public well, they beat you.
If you buy a little land and build a house,
they burn the house down and kill you!
Be their yes men with folded hands,
they treat you like human beings.
Otherwise they ask 'How can you be equal
to us?' tie you to a tree and beat you up!
Hear! This is what we should change.
If that is to be changed, there
should be land in your name.
In the present circumstances,
how can we afford to buy land?
Why should you buy?
Half of the lands you are
working on belong to you.
The British entitled you
to them while leaving.
I don't say all landlords
have grabbed land.
Some of them surely did.
We should claim them back.
See, Sir. Our ancestors had written
away their lands before they died.
How can we ask for them again?
Even if they return the lands,
where is the money to till the lands?
Hey, Muneppa! Explain!
O gentleman!
We have the exclusive
right to buy or sell land.
They don't. We own the lands.
Even if they had bought
them, it is INVALID.
We are trying hard to bring the
farm papers from the Registrar's office.
If we get them, does it mean
our lands are back to us?
What did man ever get without a fight?
But to fight, we should
first stand up for it!
Don't we need land to stand up and fight?
Unless we stand up, how can we be visible?
We will get back our lands for sure.
O Narappa! The lawyer has
explained to us our place in the society.
We should do something, brother.
I have to do something before that.
What, man?
Go!
Move on! Go on! Hmm!
Go on! You have nothing to fear. Go on!
I will see what anyone can do.
Go.
Carry on.
For the first time, our youth is showing
faith in this movement, Sir.
They understood they don't have to
live and die like slaves.
Muneppa!
Before people run out of courage and
faith, we should take the fight forward.
Their courage is the weapon of change.
Hey, Maridaiah! You put
these up at the Panchayat office.
Potanaiah! You stick them
on Sankaraiah's house.
Who? Me?
Yo! I did that once and
they broke my bones.
They could beat you then.
I will see how they would do it now.
Narappa!
Don't be angry, Narappa.
Meekness while on their
side and fury while on this side!
Do you get it now?
As long as you made money for them through liquor
and lived in submission, they had no problem.
Watch now!
Now that you have rebelled,
their true colours will come out.
They will show you what they are.
If they do that,
I will also show them what I am.
Kannamma! Go home carefully.
You also follow Kannamma.
Though the SI has given
permission, CI is obstructing it.
Narappa!
-Ah?
Take care of yourself!
-Ok, ok.
But my carefulness depends on them.
All this while, they discussed
things among themselves.
If they put up posters in public now, it is
because they are emboldened by Narappa.
To inform the public of your illegal
land grabbing and to instigate them,
-the lawyer seems to be
seeking police permission.
What did you tell them then?
To stall it or to conduct it?
I have taken the letter
and kept it with me.
Let them hold their own meeting.
Without the lawyer.
Arrest the lawyer in the railway
station and detain him there.
Brother, to prevent the lawyer
from attending the meeting,
-the police have arrested
him at the railway station itself.
So many people have come forward
trusting us. What do we do now?
If he cannot come, you
go ahead and speak!
Me? What can I speak?
Tell them what you always tell me.
To each one who came here from each
village to take this movement forward-
I give but one call!
Each village should
motivate ten more villages.
I don't know, Mom!
Till now only the elder one used
to be in agitations and movements.
Now he has influenced the younger one too.
Only God knows where
all this is going to lead.
Aunt! How is it wrong
to fight for the people?
Hey! Don't talk big like a grown up.
Go and study!
Out of the ten thousand acres, only
six hundred are in our possession.
But Narappa is sending chills
down the spine for our men.
We can send him away from there.
That's not a big issue.
Let our men sit in their midst and mix up.
Plant your flag in every single acre of
land that is occupied.
Those lands are ours!
For our lands and for our rights-er-
When the police act is invoked, how
come so many of you have gathered here?
We organized this meeting to create
awareness among people about land struggle.
Don't you need police permission for that?
How did you gather without that?
We have appealed to the police station.
They asked to us to go ahead.
Why are you still around after dark?
Go home to sleep. Go on!
Ok. Get up, men.
Sinna! Come on.
How will the Sub Inspector grant
you permission without my knowledge?
Er, Narappa! Go to the station
and get the permission letter.
One minute. Permission letter is at home.
Go and get it.
Come quickly.
Let us conduct no matter how
many meetings or how many protests,
But we should protect
our lands and our rights.
Didn't I tell you then…
-That a time comes for action?
It's now time.
Not a single one from Narappa's family
should survive. Burn down everything.
Brother, you are
committing a grave mistake.
Why do you want to turn personal
clashes into a village issue?
If that happens, how can
we live together with them?
Shut up, man! Listen!
Do as you are told.
Grandpa! It's going to rain. Come
inside and sleep. Get up! Get up!
If you gather in groups again without
permission,
I will put you all in jail.
They prevented the
lawyer from coming to us.
They sent police to stop our meeting.
They are afraid. This is our first victory.
Narappa!
While speaking at the meeting, they
hacked your brother to death. Come fast!
Brother!
Brother!...Oh, no!
Who has done all this?
Nothing will happen to you,
brother! Brother!
I thought they were all our people.
Their men merged into our group.
Lift him up.
Let us take him to the hospital.
Brother, nothing will happen to you.
They didn't even spare kids
but hacked them, brother.
Take all the survivors
to the hospital, brother.
To the hospital...
Brother!
NARAPPA!
They have set fire to our
huts in the village, brother!
Oh, no, Narappa!
Don't go inside, son!
They have charred them all to death!
I thought I would die
without seeing you, Uncle.
Grandpa broke the window
open and got out with kids.
But that idiot Seena forced them back
into the fire and locked the door, Uncle.
It pains a lot, Uncle.
Tell me, Uncle, how our life
would have been had we married.
I will happily leave
listening to it, Uncle.
Both of you go to Tadipatri and don't be seen.
-Ok, brother.
You stay here and from time to time-
Hey! Get inside!
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
Hey, Close the door!
“Come on, hack them making their heads roll”
“Break them down and slice each neck”
“Chase them and chop them severing every vein”
“Let the throats be filled with blood
Let the soil be fed with their flesh”
Hey, Come on!
Hey, come here. Come on!
Narappa!
All the ladies, please go in!
Madam! I ate out of your hand.
I ask you with courtesy. Please go in.
I won't leave unless I hack that.
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
“Come on, hack them making their heads roll”
“Break them down and slice each neck”
Get inside! - Dear!
Get inside!
Did you pay heed?
I am here for those
who set my family ablaze.
If anyone steps in to protect them,
I am going to kill them all.
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
“Come on, hack them making their heads roll”
“Break them down and slice each neck”
“Chase them and chop them severing every vein”
"Be a chisel in the heart and a sickel in the
stomach pierce through and tear their insides apart"
Narappa!..Hey!
Narappa!
Hey!
Listen!
Please, don't kill me.
The old man is requesting you..
“Become the God of Death in a frenzy
Throw the noose and break their backs”
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
Narappa!
I treated you like a son.
Please don't kill me.
“Break them down and slice each neck”
“Chase them and chop them severing every vein”
'There was nothing
left for me in that village.
I didn't want to surrender
to the police either.
I kept moving from one village to another.
They say life gives a
second chance to everyone.
That's how I met your uncle.'
Here. Drink this.
Where are you from?
What is your name?
Please give me some work.
I cannot eat for free.
Sundaramma! O, Sundaramma!
What is this, brother? You left early
morning for the fete. You are back so late!
She has been asking since morn..
Look.
This is Narappa.
I brought him as a help for us.
He will sleep on the pial.
Hmm.
'I only knew liquor brewing then.
But your Uncle taught me farming.'
Pandusami seems to consume land instead of
food! I believe he asked for your land too?
I don't know, Basavaiah.
He wants all the fields in
the village under his control.
He doesn't seem to
rest until we give it to him.
My wife is not able to take his pressure
and is advising me to give him the land.
I have my own doubts.
He may show my fields as
pretext and try to grab yours too.
Be a little careful, Basavaiah.
I would have considered it if it was my
farm alone. Sundaramma also owns it.
Brother!
'The love your mom and uncle
showed me, gave me a fresh hope in life.'
Hey, Basavaiah! There is a young girl at
home and you brought a stranger home.
What would people think?
Don't you want your sister
to get married or what?
Grandma! Can't you keep your mouth shut?
Why should I?
As if I don't want to see you married soon!
How long can your brother be by your side?
What's wrong with what grandma said?
I don't want anyone to
suffer because of me.
I will leave.
If you leave, will it stop
the wagging tongues?
What to do then?
Marry her yourself!
Forgive me for keeping
this matter from you.
I had no intention of deceiving you.
The police can pick me up any time.
While trying to help me, don't
push your sister into difficulties.
I take leave.
One minute!
Brother, if he had gone to that extent
for the sake of his family and siblings,
-he will do anything
for his wife and children.
Who you are, where you are from and
what your past is all immaterial to me.
I want you to be the father of my kids.
Until you want me to be the
mother of your kids, I will wait.
Surrender?
Yes, Milord.
What is this? How many
murders has this man committed?
Those were social
clashes in a village, Sir.
They targeted his family
and hence he attacked them.
But whatever he did was only for
self-defense, Sir.
He is still committed to his conscience.
Please kindly..
'Identifying the whole
incident as a village clash,
considering the murders as an act of
self-defense, the court gave me a normal sentence.
After my release from
prison, I married your mom.'
As kids, whenever we were scared my brother
and I would always come here to sit.
It used to feel as if we were
sitting beside our mother.
Now that you are here,
there is nothing to fear.
'After you three were born, I pushed aside
the past and started living a normal life.
I wanted to destroy that
family for killing your brother.
But I was not ready to
lose my family once again.
That's why I am quiet.'
Sinnabba, who saw his father
as an incapable drunkard,
-began to understand
who his father actually was.
Bujjamma! Come!
Hey, Sinnabba!
How are you, dear?
Hmm..
Hey, how are you, son?
-I am fine, mom.
Mom!
Hmm?
Mom!
Mom! Papa is no oridnary man.
Then where do you think you got all
your temper and nerve from?
Go to sleep.
Sundaramma!
I will go to the court tomorrow morning to speak
to the lawyer about freeing Sinnabba from the case.
You join me there.
We will come.
You go ahead.
Papa, when do we go home?
Very soon, Precious.
Ok.
Obey your father and behave yourself. Ok?
Ok.
Here. Wrap this around
so that you can't be seen.
See you, mom.
-Hmm.
Careful.
-Shall I leave, Sundaramma?
Bujjamma! Don't trouble mom. Ok?
Ok.
Come on, come on.
Why let mom stay here?
Why don't you send her to aunt's place?
Just because they gave us shelter,
Muthanna's family is still in the hospital.
If mom and Bujjamma go to aunt's house,
they will also land in trouble.
Whatever be the difficulty,
we should sort it out ourselves, Sinnabba.
Then why don't we take mom along, Papa?
If something happens to us,
at least they will survive.
Someone should
survive in our family, right?
That's why we go separate
in different directions.
When you start something, I see no
intention to fight for it and find a way!
You send someone to the grave and
then come here and stand with hands folded!
How to sort this out?
Even the Revenue Officer
has given us the permission, Sir.
Even then they resorted to this.
-Ok. Carry on. Let's go.
Narappa! How come you are here?
Who is the boy? Your younger son?
Yes, Sir.
Are you here to put him in school?
You carry on. I will follow you.
Come on. Start walking.
What did he do?
Pandusami?
Who?
The man who got my elder one killed-
Ah. Go ahead.
He hacked him.
He is dead.
Sit down.
It's ok, Sir.
His men are looking everywhere.
It took us three days to reach
here without being seen by them.
How…how old is he?
Answer.
-Sixteen.
He was hasty!
Everyone in the village knows it
was Pandusami who killed my brother.
Yet, the police filed no case against him.
You were the only one who filed a case.
But could you get him punished?
-Hey, keep quiet!
Yo! He is talking right.
You carry on.
Since he was not punished,
my mom would cry every single day.
There was no one to console my mom.
I thought if I killed him,
my mom would have some mental peace.
So I killed him, Sir.
Hey, shut up and go out.
He talks like a grown up.
Sir, they have also included
my name in the case.
Can you change it saying I was the
culprit and he had nothing to do with that?
Don't talk like a fool, Narappa!
You are his insurance!
If you take the blame and go to prison,
who will be responsible for his life?
Do you think the dead
one's men will let him be?
If you really want to protect your son,
-both of you surrender to the court first
thing in the morning. That's the best.
Sir, he is so young. Can
he survive in the prison?
He is only sixteen!
If he surrenders, he is
put only in the minor jail.
The Superintendent there is
also a member of our movement.
I will tell him to take proper care.
Why are you still hesitant?
Once you promise,
there is no hesitation, Sir.
Please speak to him.
Have your food and go.
O, gentleman! Go and have your meal.
-Hmm.
Bring your dad to the court
carefully tomorrow morning.
Ok, Sir.
-Get it?
Come on.
-Let's go.
You must fight, man!
Only when we stand up, we will be visible.
What's the point in criticizing the others?
You can find a path in
the jungle even in the dark.
And you say you couldn't find that
drunkard and you want me to believe it!
But he knows the jungle as much as I do.
Anyway, it is not that easy to catch him.
Or did you spare him
because he is one of you?
Master Dorasamy! Please don't say that.
Serve a dog in a golden
plate. It would only lick it.
Hey!
Hey, stop it.
-Look at him, Uncle!
He is ready to hit me.
-I asked you to hold it!
Dorasami!
For the help your brother gave my father,
I am doing things against my conscience.
It is with the same
loyalty that I spare you!
Hey!
You gave him one whole night to escape
and now you say you cannot do anything.
Master! You have lots of men with you.
Get it done through them.
Hey,
I know what to do.
Go away!
Brother! Kondappa here!
I found Narappa's wife
in the court, brother.
Then he would definitely come
there with the young.
You guys stay there.
Case Number 201, 212
Rambabu and others.
Bhadrakumar!
Your father's name?
-Chalamaiah.
Kumaraswamy!
Your father's name?
-Narasappa.
Yo!
-Sir?
Why put them in cuffs here?
-He escaped four or five times, Sir.
Cuff them outside the Court.
I keep arresting you and you keep escaping.
What is this?
Lady!
Lady!
Sir!
-Come here.
Bujjamma! Come.
Sir!
Where is Narappa?
I am also waiting for him.
He will be here, Sir.
Ok, go.
Papa, can you buy me slippers?
How much?
-Three rupees.
Give my son a pair.
So? Are they right?
Yes, Papa.
Ok.Let's go.
What, Basavaiah!
Why are you here?
I wanted to meet someone.
Hmm. Ok. Carry on.
Yo! Narappa will definitely come here.
Hmm.
It's him.
Where is he?
-He is on the way, Sir.
It's getting late!
Please do something, Sir.
So, are all our guys here?
-Yes, they are all here, brother.
Be alert.
He shouldn't escape from here.
-Ok, brother.
Hey, why do you want that bag of bombs?
Throw it in the garbage bin there.
Wait.
Hey! Pandusami's men are all here.
Sir!
Come, come. Come and have some food.
It's ok, Sir.
My client is on his way here to surrender.
It might take a little longer.
-Ok, ok. No problem.
Thank you, Sir...
Hey, come on.
Bro, how much for the pea nuts?
Come here, lady. Where are you going?
We came to hand over
food to my husband, Sir. - Ok, go ahead.
I will be back.
-Ok.
Make sure he won't surrender in the court.
-Ok, Uncle.
Greetings.
Get me that file!
-Get me that file!
What are you doing here?
Sir..
He is not a lawyer to wait for you!
-Sir..
He is a Magistrate!
Sir, he will definitely come.
-I told him to come to the court in the morning,
You made a fool of me!
Crap!
Sir, please don't get angry.
Give me the file!
Sir.
Ask him not to show me his face.
Brother!
Greetings, Sir.
-What did you come for again?
You wanted to take care of things yourself!
You should have gone.
The situation at the court wasn't good, Sir.
-Quiet! Just be quiet!
You forced me to go and beg him!
You are all big people!
Take care of your lives yourself.
Six hours! I stood there
for six hours for you!
Sir, if that was the case,
why would I come back here?
They somehow found out
we were going to the court.
They surrounded us with knives and daggers.
We felt the issue will become bigger, if
we throw bombs in the court premises.
So we came back here, Sir.
Sir, you can negotiate with
them and solve this problem, Sir.
And how would I do that?
You know I have a piece of land.
That still remains a pain for them.
I will hand over the land to them.
Ask them to talk to the inspector to free Sinnabba
from the case and end this in the panchayat, Sir.
Sir!
Tthe magistrate wanted me to
speak to you about something.
Er…Pandusami's murder case.
Sir, the accused is a minor and
that is why because of all this...
Yo! As if this is a court!
Why don't you speak in Telugu?
Why such fancy for English?
Sorry, Sir.
The victim is a well-known person, Sir.
Ok! I don't deny it!
But why do you want to nab those who
are trying to surrender before the court?
Why you are so involved
in this case is my question.
Sir! Their entire family is
waiting to kill Narappa's son, Sir.
They will go to any extent
for the sake of revenge.
Isn't it our duty to save that boy, Sir?
They want Narappa's farm.
Do they want it or not?
If it was given when asked,
this problem wouldn't have arisen.
Two lives would have been spared, Sir.
Ask them to attend the
Panchayat to discuss this.
How can I ask them to
come to the Panchayat, Sir?
Yo! They have but two options.
Either to attend the Panchayat and settle
the dispute amicably and respectably,
Or let all men in Pandusami's family die
in the process of killing Narappa's son.
Check the finger prints
in the witness column.
Yeah, They are doing
it. You do it, Basavaiah.
You are putting your
finger print on the document.
You shouldn't over ride
Panchayat's decision.
We will do whatever you say, Sir.
What do you say, Rangababu?
We have already agreed to everything.
Tell us and we shall obey it.
Look, people!
Narappa has only three
acres as his property.
He is handing it over as compensation
for the death of Pandusami.
If you ask me whether three acres
equals the life of a man, it doesn't.
But, Pandusami lost his life because
his men had killed Narappa's son.
In all fairness, you are
supposed to compensate Narappa.
But then, to save his younger son, he
is handing over his only property to you.
Even you want the case to be closed.
-Yes.
Narappa admits he is
responsible for the murder.
After this, no one should
touch his son, Sinnabba. Ok?
That's fine. In that case ask him to come and
fall at our feet at the Panchayat and apologize!
Ah? You expect him to give you his property,
and ask for forgiveness falling at your feet?
If he does that, will
the case be struck off?
How can they do that, Sir?
-Then inform them!
My son will not fall at anyone's feet.
Then at least ask your son to come once.
You are asking the boy to come
here when the policeman is around.
Is it to get him arrested?
How could you say that, Basavaiah?
Would I do such a thing?
After all you are a policeman!
How can we trust you, Sir?
No need of that, brother.
Even if we comply,
these people won't be quiet.
If something happens to
him, we won't be responsible.
First ask Narappa to
surrender before the court.
Also, we can't get the
orchard registered in our name.
Of course not. In whose
name do you want it?
Subbadasu is here.
Ask them to register it in his name.
Brother, where are you off to?
Just here. I want to go out for a while.
Your dad asked you not
to go anywhere, didn't he?
I want to pee.
Don't go too far, son.
You have done me a great favour, Sir.
Don't cry, dear.
It's for your son that
he is doing all this.
Sir, how did they concede so easily?
That's what beats me!
We should think about it.
When you surrender in the court, you
should be more careful about your son.
Do one thing.
Keep Sinnabba in a safe
place and then meet me.
Ok, Sir.
Should you go right now?
Why don't you stay for
the night and go tomorrow?
No, dear. It's better I leave now.
Speak to him before you leave.
Tell him to go to school seriously.
Ok, I will tell him.
He doesn't obey even when you are around.
Ask the priest to offer
worship on his behalf.
Ok.
You said he was around here?
I told him to stay somewhere around.
He is too restless to stay put.
Priest! Where is our boy?
He said he was going to pee
but quite a while ago.
Hey, Sinnabba!
Hey, Basavaiah! Where did you disappear?
I was looking for you all over the place.
Why were you looking for me?
You have already got my land!
Now enjoy it!
How can you say that in this situation?
Narappa! Here. First take this.
Why would I need your property?
I have been with them for years
and even lost my arm for them.
They did nothing for me.
How did you trust their words?
While you were transferring your
land, they had kidnapped Sinnabba.
Papa!
They want to kill him at the same place where
your son killed Pandusami and dragged him there.
Hey!
Go to the village
and bring all our men.
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
“Come on, hack them making their heads roll”
“Break them down and slice each neck”
“Chase them and chop them severing every vein”
“Let the throats be filled with blood
Let the soil be fed with their flesh”
“Turn the blue sky and
the colour of breeze to red”
“Be a weapon in the hands of a weapon
And celebrate the dance of death”
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
“Come on, hack them making their heads roll”
“Break them down and slice each neck”
“Chase them and chop them severing every vein”
"Four for a blow and ten for a stab
Hunting is no new sport; none will be spared"
"Raging moments and your fiery eyes
set them ablaze and no one survives"
I kept saying no and
yet you brought it this far!
“Come on! Hack them in all retaliation
And with all your fury”
“Come on, hack them making their heads roll”
“Break them down and slice each neck”
“Chase them and chop them severing every vein”
Papa!
Help me live, Uncle!
Rangababu!
Hey, Sinnabba, go!
How can I go, Papa?
-Don't think about me. Just go!
Come along, Papa. Let us go together.
-I told you to go! Go!
Let him kill me! But
don't spare that fellow!
Kill him! Hey, beat him to death!
Papa!
Papa!
Uncle! I want coconut sweet
Papa!
Hey! Come on! Come!
Hey, wait! Stop!
Look! We are not here to clash with you.
We are here to take our people home.
If it isn't for a fight, why
did you come with lances? To cut grass?
When he brought people from the
other village to slaughter the boy,
how did you all watch
as if it were a stage programme?
But you expect us to sit folding our hands?
Listen! This is a clash
between two families.
They killed one. We killed one.
It was already decided in the Panchayat.
Only one person was killed
on your side, Basavaiah.
If we remain silent,
many could lose lives here.
Are we responsible for that?
We reached an agreement in the Panchayat.
Who dishonored it?
Look at him how they had beaten a kid!
If we didn't interfere,
they would have killed him.
Careful, Narappa.
I have been warning you not to turn
your personal problem into a village issue.
Why don't you understand, Basavaiah?
You ask them now?
Who told you I didn't ask them then?
It was me who always questioned them!
'That day, both the villages met
and brought a closure to the issue.
Confining the whole incident to a rift
between the families of Narappa and Pandusami.'
Take good care of Bujjamma and your Mom.
You are the only one they have now.
How can I care for them
the way you do, Papa?
You can take really good care, Sinnppa.
Everyone knows Pandusami killed brother.
Yet, the police did nothing.
Then, why should we
go to jail for killing him?
I was the one who committed the crime.
Why should you go to jail, Papa? Let me go.
Did I take all the trouble
to see you go to jail?
All the fields and orchards in the
village are in Pandusami's name.
That family can live on it
for ten more generations.
But they were uneasy about our three acres.
That was their mistake.
Uncle, I want coconut sweet.
Brother-in-law, please attend to Bujjamma.
To find your brother's body, neither
the police nor the courts have helped.
That was their mistake.
Grieving for your brother, we
have neglected you and Bujjamma.
That was our mistake.
Narappa! You are next.
Lawyer sir is calling you.
Ok, Madam.
You tried to protest in the way you
could against the wrongs you have noticed.
But that is not the only
way to stand up to them.
Sinnabba!
If we have land, they grab it from us.
If we have money, they snatch it.
But no one can take away our
education from us, Sinnabba.
If you want to retaliate
and win over them, study.
Study well, gain authority and
occupy that authoritative position.
But once you are in that position, don't try
to do unto them what they had done to us.
Vengeance is better nipped than fostered.
We are born of the same soil.
We speak the same language.
Isn't that enough to live together?
Ok, Papa.
