- Awesome!
- Yeah!
Okay.
Good job, man. Yeah.
Quiet down!
Anggun wants to say something.
- Okay, uh...
- Okay.
God damn, you guys!
You know what I think.
I'm blown away!
Knocked it out of the park.
I'm speechless.
Uh, don't mind the tears.
Okay. Everyone did a great job.
Why don't we pray for award night?
- All right.
- All right.
Everyone, please close your eyes.
According to old faiths, let us pray.
...to stage this wonderful performance...
All right. Congrats to us.
Group hug, Mata Hari!
Mata... Hari!
Win or lose, doesn't matter.
'Cause tomorrow night at Rama's,
we'll party!
Listen, what's done is done.
Not everyone's perfect.
I know you can't control everything.
With that said, I just wish that...
You should've paid more attention.
Now, listen to me. Remember this.
When someone makes a mistake,
you gotta help out.
Brother Tariq, excuse me,
but may I go home now?
- My family's expecting me soon.
- What's that?
Gotta go now
so you can be with your family?
Why, aren't we your family?
Not that I wanna.
My mother really needs me.
- I was messing up with you.
- You're not staying?
For the awarding?
It's two hours.
I don't think
I can wait that long.
After the awarding,
I'll make sure to update the website.
Take care, then.
You hear that, guys? Lady Sur'll shall
no longer be gracing us with her presence.
She's going home.
Thank you and goodbye, everyone.
All right! South Jakarta bound!
South Jakarta bound, guys!
South Jakarta bound! Get in!
Going to the South.
- Ma'am.
- Huh?
- My boss messaged you.
- What message?
I don't know.
I can't even find my phone.
Why can't you remember the order?
- Hello, I'm back.
- Welcome back.
- Hello.
- Get over here and help me find my phone.
- I forgot where I put it.
- I'll give it a ring.
That won't work.
I put it on silent.
All right, wait.
Weird. I thought it was here.
Dang. Is that a laptop?
You're so high-tech!
I'm glad you're studying computer science.
Take us to the future.
Hey. Someone's calling your phone.
Dad, I triggered the alarm from my laptop.
- Why are you late?
- The play literally only just finished.
Quit wasting your time.
It's not even part
of your major in college.
Diner's busy now.
So how was it? Did you guys win?
Right. I should check.
No way!
Hey! Congrats, honey!
So that's rice, an order of liver satay,
and an order of sauteed kale?
Yup, that's my order.
- Sur.
- Yeah?
You getting busy with that.
What about your studies?
It's going well, Mom.
This stuff's actually good for my CV.
It shows that I can make
a proper website all on my own.
And it'll also be good
for my scholarship reports.
When's your next report due anyway?
Day after tomorrow.
- How much?
- Your drink.
Two bucks.
Hmm.
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome.
Mata Hari!
Hey, what are you'll doing skipping class?
Go back to your classes!
Look at that.
The decision has been made.
That after the triumph of the play,
Medusa et Perseus,
in the Student Theater Festival,
the faculty will continue supporting
the Mata Hari theater group,
which includes bolstering its efforts
to join the Asian Student
Theater Festival in Kyoto next month!
I'm reasonably hopeful
that our very own dynamic duo,
the playwright, Rama, our bright poet,
and Anggun, the brilliant director,
will carry on in bringing
even more success to our great university!
Kudos to them!

Before you forget,
everyone is expected to be at Rama's
by 6:00 p.m. for you-know-what.
Thank you.

- You guys won, huh? Where's the big feast?
- Does it matter?
- I'm just the website designer, Amin.
- Seeing as how you made the website here,
- pay the power bill.
- Dang! What are you, a loan shark?
All right, fine.
I'll get you lunch. What do you want?
Some sushi.
You're going to Japan, right?
- Make sure it's fresh.
- There's no way I'm going there.
Only 15 guys get to go,
and who am I? A nobody.
- Amin, you got printing work.
- Go ahead, boss.
Printing out another draft?
Mm-hmm. I got to translate it.
Apart from that, I also need to take
new photos for the installation sets.
By the way, Sur,
my dad's looking for a web designer.
It's for a charity gala he's gonna be
organizing with his fellow artists.
And I showed him
Mata Hari's website to see what he thinks,
and he likes it.
You serious?
I recommended you to him.
So please come, okay?
You can bring anyone you want.
Doesn't matter if it's your friend
or your family. Anyone. Okay?
Thirty copies, yeah?
- I can't get it done today.
- No problem.
Amelia is overworked.
Amelia? Why do you call it Amelia?
- No reason really. Sounds pretty, right?
- Figure out what it means.
She does look tired actually.
- Keep the change, buddy.
- Thanks, boss.
Hear that? I can take anyone I want.
You gonna come with me?
Yeah. No, thanks, Sur.
See that pile there?
Like the Eiffel Tower.
Even if there's gonna be free food?
Come on. I'll even pay for gas.
- It's just Rama's house is a bit too far.
- I knew it. You just needed a ride there.
What I need is this job offer.
I haven't gotten my scholarship grant.
- We'll be done by 8:00. Yeah?
- 8:00 p.m. Not a minute later.
Help me out here. Come on.
Oh! And the party has a dress code.
Anything from the '40s.
- You got stuff like that, right?
- Well, no shit.
Are you new in Mata Hari?
Yeah. Why?
Don't bother going to that party.
Waste of time. Anything else is better.
Why's that exactly?
Better to just focus
on your scholarship report.
It's due tomorrow, right?
Another thing. Stop seeking out attention
and trying to be popular.
- Six for 60 cents?
- Yep.
What's the deal with her?
- I'll be going now, Mom.
- Mm.
Hand, please.
Godspeed. You've got this.
- Go, get that job!
- Of course. I will, Mom.
I'll go straight home
right after the meeting.
- I'll be home by 9:00 p.m.
- Hey.
- Where are you going?
- An interview for a website job, Dad.
What?
So who's gonna be helping
your mother in there?
It's okay. I gave
her permission to go. It'll be fine.
It doesn't make any sense.
Why would someone even
schedule a job interview
after office hours?
We're also having a small party
for that award our theatre group we won.
- Is it a party or an interview?
- It's an interview.
Well, if it's a job interview...
how about not wearing
such a revealing dress?
Everyone there's gonna be
dressed up like this.
Then put something under it.
Hey.
Promise me. No alcohol.
Got it.
Who's that rude senior back at the shop?
She was cranky.
Farah?
It's okay. Just ignore her.
She was a member of Mata Hari.
Photographer, I think.
But she was kicked out.
Got tangled into a lot of flings.
At least, that's what I heard.
Can I get your name?
Suryani, sir. I'm going in
with my friend here.
Suryani.
Damn, this house is huge!
I know, right?
So many statues.
That's 'cause
Rama's dad's a sculptor.
♪ Hi, Mata Hari ♪
- Amin.
- Hmm?
Can you tuck in your shirt please?
- Tuck it in?
- Looks better.
Hey, good to see you.
I was so nervous.
Great, thanks. Don't forget to pay.
Hi.
Everyone, I wanna thank
each and every one of you for being here.
But, first, an announcement.
Anyway, big news,
on our ticket situation
for the flight to Kyoto,
it'll be sponsored by Uncle Soemarno
and Aunt Lilis. Can you believe it?
Give it up for Rama's parents!
Uncle, Aunt,
thank you so much for always supporting
the Mata Hari family.
- Anything for you kids.
- What do we say?
Thank you so much, Uncle and Aunt!
None of this would've been possible
without our wonderful staff.
I'd like to thank everyone
who has contributed.
First off, our very own tough guy
and production manager, Tariq the badass!
Wait! Don't get too happy.
Remember. You still have
to arrange for our visas.
Also, thank you to our enchanting Medusa
for her brilliant performance,
Take a bow, Kirana!
Thank you so much.
Let's not forget
our visual art crew, Samsul!
Samsul, thank you.
And last,
but definitely not the least, guys,
we had a full house yesterday,
and this wasn't some weird coincidence.
Thanks to our super cool website.
Give it up
for our website designer, Suryani!
Thank you.
Oh, Dad, this is Sur,
our very own web designer.
Hi, Sur.
- Hi, Uncle.
- What a cool website that was.
Thank you very much.
I believe Rama's told you about the offer?
Yeah. He did. He told me.
- Thank you. Glad you're on board.
- Yeah.
Thank you for the opportunity, Uncle.
Hey, empty. Fill it up.
- Hi, Sur!
- Hi, Anggun.
Here. Take this.
Careful.
Hey, thank you so much. I mean it.
Don't get tired of working with us. Okay?
- Yes, Anggun.
- Let's toast to it.
No. Let's try that again.
When we toast,
we need to make eye contact.
Or else, it's bad luck. Okay?
Now look me in the eyes. Yeah?
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
Mmm.
What's with that look on your face?
Behold!
Here comes Medusa. Watch out!
Okay, listen up. Whoever gets shot
by Medusa's gaze will take a shot!
Yeah?
Brace yourself! Here we go!
Oh!
It's you, Amin!
Give it, give it, give it!
Drink up! Drink up!
Drink up! Drink up! Drink up!
- Bring me my copies, Amin!
- This is pretty fun. Let's stay a while.
Again, again, again, again, again!
Drink up!
Drink up! Drink up!
- Sur.
- Mm?
Let's get out of here!
What, right now?
Is there somewhere
you gotta be?
Look around, everyone's here.
Not like anyone's gonna be at your shop.
You promised we'd be gone by 8:00.
Fried tofu anyone?
For only five cents.
Fried tofu for only five cents.
Fried tofu...
...for only five cents.
Fried tofu for five cents.
Sur, sit down here.
Sur. I said take a seat!
I have my scholarship review today.
Dad! Dad, no! Wait!
- Stop. I want to talk to you.
- Please, let her go!
- Let her do her report first!
- Stay out of this!
- This is because you gave her permission!
- I'm taking your shoes.
- Bye.
- Hey, Sur.
I'm late, Dad!
- Listen to me!
- I said I'm late, Dad!
Take public transport!
You got wasted last night?
Hey! Mind watching my phone for me?
You almost didn't make it.
Good morning, sir.
Sorry I'm late. I left early,
but got stuck in traffic.
Any reason you're wearing a kebaya?
I'm sure it's not Women's Day.
- I doubt it's your graduation day, either.
- I'm sorry.
I have to wear it today.
I know it's not proper.
I have an event right after,
and the dress code is kebaya.
This is my report, sir.
- This semester, I've been able to apply...
- Hold it. Just wait.
I'd like to ask you something.
Answer me. Do you often like
to go out on party at night clubs?
No, of course, sir. Not at all.
- Do you drink often?
- What? No, sir.
So what's this then?
Explain. Because I wonder why
you uploaded these to your social media?
Uh... I didn't upload any of these, sir!
So who did? Your assistant or something?
But you did go to a party last night?
You're still wearing the same dress.
Let me explain.
She told us that she needs to wear it
because it's a dress code for an event.
- Sir, I'm wearing this...
- I am appalled.
Why have you've been slacking off
since last semester?
Partying and drinking alcohol
is not Indonesian culture.
The alumni are paying for your studies.
Sir, first of all,
I never took those photos
nor did I upload them.
And apart from that, even until now,
I still meet all of the required cri...
The requirements
for this scholarship.
My GPA is above 3.6,
and I have full attendance, sir.
We know that. However,
your academic performance
and your behavior
are both important, Suryani.
Reason that we give out these scholarships
is because we want our students
to use them for good causes, not to become
proponents of this kind of rubbish.
Sir, I've always joined
productive activities.
The website I made helped Mata Hari win.
Everything I've done...
Wait a second.
You're here to study computer science.
We don't have a theater group, right?
What's you major again?
Let's get to the point.
We'll have to deliberate on this.
And whatever the result, we'll be sure
to let you know immediately.
To be honest,
your session is over, anyway. We're done.
Look at yourself. I don't believe
you're even fully sober yet.
Farah Natia.
Amin.
Who pulled a prank on me?
- Amin.
- What do you mean?
- Who took and uploaded those selfies?
- How would I know, Sur?
How come you never woke me up
on the way home?
I didn't take you home.
I went home before you.
So you left me there?
You told me to go home, so I went home.
You were dancing like crazy anyway.
- Wisnu Brata?
- Present.
- Xavier Wibowo?
- Present.
- And last, Yanuar Joko?
- Present.
- All right. I'm gonna be...
- Miss?
You haven't called my name yet.
It should be there. Suryani.
Have you completed
the admission process for this semester?
I have, Miss.
But I haven't paid the tuition fee yet.
I'm waiting for my scholarship.
All right.
Please settle that first if you can.
If your name's not in here,
then I'm afraid you can't join this class.
Let's continue.
We'll start with the first chapter.
Watch where you're walking!
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen!
This is an official announcement
from the city hall.
In order to control the worsening
dengue fever outbreak in Indonesia,
the government
is providing free fumigation
in this area for everyone's safety.
Please remain inside your house...
You closed the diner?
'Cause of the fumigation?
So from now on,
I have to pay for your tuition as well?
"Terminated due to inappropriate conduct."
No, Mom. This isn't right.
Dad.
Wait, what are you doing, Dad? Dad!
You've broken our religion's sacred law
by drinking alcohol.
From now on, you should no longer
consider yourself a member of this family.
Let me explain. You don't know
what happened. You can't do this!
Save it. I don't need
an explanation from you.
Dad...
All of our neighbors know
that you went home heavily drunk.
Some guy was carrying you
along the alleyways,
knocking on every single door
along the way,
waking up all our poor neighbors.
- Dad...
- All just to find where you were living.
You know what time that happened? Hmm?
At 3:00 in the morning, Sur.
- Dad, please, listen to me.
- Hey.
Ever since this morning,
everyone has been coming, asking.
"What's wrong with Sur?"
"Who was that guy carrying her?"
Your mom and I had to lie
to every single one of them.
That was your interview?
Getting drunk?
You don't understand.
I wanted to celebrate my achievement!
Achievement?
That stunt cost you your scholarship.
Was that worth celebrating?
You call that an achievement?
Who's going to pay for your tuition now?
Don't you feel bad for your mother?
Consider this as your punishment,
so you may repent.
Masha Allah.
Uh, hey, Chitra? Excuse me.
I was wondering if you knew
who took me home last night?
What time did you go home?
I think I left at around 10:00 that night.
All sobered up?
Chit, Anggun wants to make
some changes to the Gorgon costume.
Can you add more beige to it?
Damn.
I need to go to the shop again.
- See what you can do. Yeah.
- I'll let you know tomorrow.
- Hey, Tariq...
- Shh. Not now.
Hey, morons!
What the hell did you do with the package?
Do I always
have to clean up after your shit?
- Where's your sense of urgency?
- Sorry, brother.
- How about you stop fucking up?
- Sorry, bro.
- Tariq...
- Sur, can you stop bugging me?
- Can't you see I'm busy?
- I just wanna ask if you know who...
- Hey, Rama.
- Hi, Sur.
Sorry. Do you know
who it was that took me home last night?
- NetCar, right?
- Where you the one who booked it?
- No, Anggun got it for you. Why?
- Oh.
Stop. Not right now.
Anggun's rehearsing a scene.
Wait, let me get her for you.
It sounds so weird saying it like that.
Right? Gotta tone it down a bit.
Sur's asking about the NetCar
you booked for her after the party.
All right, pause. I'll be quick.
Sorry, sorry.
Okay, Sur.
What happened was, uh...
Everyone left with their own cars,
so I booked a NetCar for you.
Did you lose anything?
No, but what time was that?
Let me just check the booking history.
- Here.
- Was I... Was I up or completely out of it?
Girl, last night you were really drunk.
I tried to wake you up,
but you were out cold.
So I'm sorry, I went through your stuff.
I had to find your ID to get your address.
- Can you send it to me?
- Sure thing.
Uh...
Done. Ical, come here.
Can you please take out... Take it.
Take out the Perseus helmet.
It needs a bit more aging.
- Oh, okay.
- Wait! Got a smoke?
Do you know
who posted these selfies of me online?
What? So you mean
you didn't upload these yourself?
I can't remember.
Well, the room was dark.
Everyone was dancing.
Everything was kinda fanatic.
When the party started settling,
the lights came back on,
and I saw you passed out.
I'm not sure what happened in between.
Do you remember laying down?
Mm.
I remember I was exhausted,
so then I stopped dancing,
but nothing after that.
What's wrong with these selfies?
Why? Did they, like, get you into trouble?
Well, it's common
to lose control when you're drunk, Sur.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Take it from me,
I once drunk-dialed my ex.
- Anggun?
- Hmm?
- All set. Let's start again.
- Wait. Let me gather my thoughts.
- Did you find Tariq? Where is he?
- No idea.
I'm sorry, Sur, I have to leave you now.
If anything happens, you talk to me.
I mean it. Okay?
Rama, help her out.
Let's go. We'll start again.
So, like Angunn said,
if you lost something, don't hesitate.
- Call me and I'll help you find it.
- Rama!
The revised installation set
has arrived. Right here.
Yeah, okay. Uh, unwrap it.
- You have my number, right?
- Yeah.
Turn it on.
So this picture...
This one's a picture of the Milky Way?
Otong, please copy.
Yo, can you go and get me a kimono, Otong?
Hey. Here's your kimono.
Welcome to the Mata Hari family.
Anggun, do you need me?
- Where were you?
- Restroom.
Everyone was looking for you.
Stop fooling around!
What exactly did you drink?
Blacking out like that.
Don't know, but I think
I had wine, and then...
What did we drink? The one when we played
that game with the Medusa head?
Whiskey?
- And what else?
- I forgot.
Kind of weird your eyes are open.
Doesn't look like you're sleeping.
What are you talking about?
That's normal. That's how I sleep.
Remember when I slept
in class back in primary school?
I'm sure someone's pranking me.
But why? Why me?
Hey. Look at this.
Not the same size.
Front cam's different from the rear one.
They used rear camera. Doesn't make sense.
I don't take selfies with my rear camera.
- Damn it. They're all the same.
- No, it's different!
- I'll check if anyone posted videos of me.
- Hey!
Don't waste the new ones.
There are used ones.
Video one is
Gita taking a selfie
in front of a mirror at 11:00 p.m.
Video two is
Udiarti's Boomerang video
in the garden at 5:00 p.m.
Video three is
the dance floor
in the living room at 11:30 p.m.
The videos are disappearing.
It's been 24 hours.
Take screenshots! Quick!
I hope you learned a lesson
for the next time you wanna get hammered.
Be careful.
What valuable lesson? You jerk.
Here. Look at this.
They did this to the new members.
I knew they did stuff
like this as initiation,
but they won't admit
they did anything to me at all.
The time is 12:15 a.m.
I need you, as the dean,
to convince the Board of Alumni.
How could I lose my scholarship
over some meaningless selfies?
Like I've already told you, Sur,
the faculty can't interfere
with the board's decisions.
And from what I've heard,
the board monitors the social media
accounts of every single recipient.
Now think about it.
What did you think would happen
once they saw drunken selfies
on your profile?
That's irrelevant. I didn't violate
my scholarships requirement.
That's complete nonsense!
It's obviously in the requirements.
You should pay
more attention to the contract.
"The recipients
shall not commit immoral acts
and must maintain their integrity."
Go ahead if you have a few ideas.
I'm all ears.
If you know how to get their trust back.
Even though you used their money
to party around, get drunk. All in public.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
I'll stay here from now on.
I need to find out who did this to me.
What do you mean?
Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna hack
into all the members' phones.
What, are you completely nuts?
Playing detective, huh?
You gotta catch up on sleep.
'Cause I swear, you've really lost it.
Poor Sur.
You're still drunk from that night?
When will you sober up, next week?
Sur.
This is my turf, okay?
You stay over here.
Don't you come near my fishes.
If all my fish die, I'm gonna lose money.
How long are you staying?
Now that we're living together...
a man and woman, unmarried,
if the campus found out,
they'd fire me instantly.
That's not the worst part.
Getting shamed in public is.
In the next three days,
I'll find as much evidence as I can.
The theater members
will pass through here often.
- They're gonna be preparing their visas.
- I'll work as usual, okay?
For the mosquitos.
- Amin, print this.
- Sure.
Min?
Wi-Fi dead or something?
I can't log in to my email.
Been bugging out all night.
Where's your file at?
Is it on your phone?
Yeah, it's here.
Go ahead. Plug your phone in
through the USB.
Wi-Fi's never died before, dude.
Tell the shitty provider.
Shit.
- Amin, it's five pages. How much?
- Fifty cents.
- Cool, thanks, dude.
- Yep.
What'd you get?
He disconnected
before I could finish copying it.
What was I supposed to do?
We'll do it this way.
Here.
If you can hear me
playing some folk music,
it means I'm still copying.
So just keep buying time for me.
Then if I change to rock music,
then that means I'm done.
You can let them go at that point.
You're a pain in the ass.
Come on,
fix your damn Wi-Fi, dude!
Yeah.
You're joining that protest?
- There's gonna be one?
- The dean came and told me.
Ugh. That's just a rumor.
Wait! Don't pull out the connection yet.
This computer has viruses.
I'll put an antivirus
on your phone so we can scan it.
Huh? The fuck!
An antivirus for a phone?
You don't want to lose
your data, right? Let me do it.
Fuck off. I don't need it.
It'll only take a minute. Wait.
You prick.
Cut it out, Amin. I don't need it.
I said piss off!
My professor's gonna kill me if I'm late!
Cut the bullshit.
- Don't blame, okay?
- Don't worry. It's fine. Just give it.
Yeah?
I need to print this quickly. I'll email.
Wi-Fi's dead. Sorry.
Just plug it into the PC directly.
Really?
Moses.
- What's for dinner?
- Just order from NetFood.
Pick anything that you want.
It's on me.
How about some satay?
Udiarti.
This is Rama.
How's it going? Find anything?
Too bad only four guys came in today.
So, there's like 40 theater members.
How're you sure they're all gonna come by?
- When will you ever find out?
- Shut up please.
Starting tomorrow, how about
you start hacking non-theater students?
- Maybe it'll help.
- Right. Let's just do that.
You're gonna steal their thesis
or just stalk them, you creep?
I'm just trying to help out here.
Besides, I've stopped selling theses.
I'm not a sinner anymore. Trust me.
Dirty money ain't for me.
Look who's stalking.
You're the stalker here.
I'm looking at photos
from that night at the party.
Right. Then why are you
looking at their old photos?
Hi.
Got some booze back there?
- You do, right?
- No, I don't.
- Why don't you go home?
- It's a shitshow back there.
- I'm coming in.
- Hey, don't. I got work to do.
Hmm.
You got a girl back there?
Yeah. Amelia.
So Amelia wear shoes now?
I thought she'd be like a size 9.
Shut up, dude.
These are my sister's.
"Sister's," my ass.
Poor Amelia, she's jealous.
Can you kindly fuck off?
Go to your boys or whoever can stand you.
Shut the fuck up, bitch.
Why you acting all busy and shit?
You let me hang out here
all the time, you jerk off.
Hey. Who was that friend
of yours yesterday?
- Sur?
- Mm.
How'd she end up
getting so wasted like that?
No idea. I left earlier.
How'd she get home then?
Was anyone with her?
NetCar.
Ugh, what the fuck, man?
You let her go alone in a NetCar?
Yeah. What's wrong with that?
Not as if she didn't get home
in one piece. Calm your tits.
Idiot!
Stupid, brainless, nitwit fucking moron!
Dumbass can't even use his head.
Ms. Anggun, uh, how can I help you?
So I ordered a NetCar
for my friend the other night.
I noticed that the car arrived
at the destination point
later than the expected time for arrival.
To be precise, it arrived about
an hour longer than expected.
I'm afraid something
might've happened to my friend.
Um...
Did you experience any rudeness
or unpleasant treatment from your driver?
- Or did you lose anything?
- I'm not sure yet. So we have to check.
Hmm...
- So you were the passenger?
- That's right.
Okay, then. Did you lose anything or what?
I told you I'm not sure yet.
Because I was asleep the whole trip.
Can we just go ahead and check it now?
- Computer's getting hot. Might as well.
- Yeah.
The queue number is 425.
So far, the car's route
was still on track.
Yup.
Hold on. I need to make a call.
The queue number is 430.
- Hey, Anggun.
- Hmm?
Have you ever been so drunk
you passed out?
I have. Yeah.
However, the only reason that it happened
was because I skipped dinner.
What about you?
You skip dinner that night?
No, I didn't.
Hmm.
Maybe you couldn't handle it
because it was your first time drinking?
Listen, Sur,
if you ever feel like sharing anything,
I'm here to listen.
Feel anything wrong?
No, I...
I don't feel any...
- It's just...
- Mm?
Is it possible that
someone could've drugged my drinks?
What, you mean our guys?
No, that's impossible.
I know some of them are fucking crazy,
but trust me, I'm sure that none of them
would ever cross the line.
That's silly.
Maybe I should take
some kind of urine test?
Sur.
You sure about that?
Some of them
were smoking weed at the party.
Did you take some?
The queue number is 430.
- I still don't remember.
- Well,
suppose you do take that urine drug test,
and it comes back positive?
- Go on. Move it! She's right there.
- Yes.
- Here she is.
- Yes.
I remember driving her
the other night, sir.
Really? If that's true,
you owe us an explanation.
How'd you arrive
so late at the destination?
Well, yesterday I had to make a pit stop
right beside Kendil Park.
You see, I suddenly had a flat tire.
I had no choice
but to change it right there.
I actually did try numerous times
to wake her up.
But no matter what I did,
she wouldn't wake up.
Anyway, so, yeah,
I continued changing the tire.
And, yes, indeed, you could say,
it took a while,
but that's because I was alone,
and it was raining.
Here, look. I took pictures.
Take a look.
Can I take some photos, sir?
Sure. Certainly. Go right ahead.
Take all that you need.
I think I drove through
all the nail traps on the road.
Did you change the tire
by yourself? No one helped you?
No. I did it all by myself.
Who else was gonna help me?
And I'm sorry.
But I had to walk you home of course.
Except, when I was taking you out,
you sort of... Well, you threw up.
It was all over the backseat,
not to mention my carpets.
Mm. Oh, really?
All over the car you say?
- Looks like someone's been partying hard.
- We're good, sir.
That's it? Very well then. Sure.
But please keep in mind,
- Mr. Burhan here is a good man.
- Yeah.
The driver can file
the same complaint against customers
that were behaving inappropriately.
- Kinda amazing he didn't.
- Mm-hmm. Fuck off.
Uh, so, listen.
There's also just one more thing.
Hold on a sec.
I need to take this.
Yeah?
I'm in the parking lot. What is it?
A sprained ankle?
Why haven't you called the doctor yet?
Why did you call me?
Hurry up and do it. Yeah.
Sorry. Come again?
Nothing. Sorry for all the trouble.
And thanks for the gelato.
You didn't have to.
Anytime, Sur.
Promise you'll give me a call
if you need anything.
I need to check on Tariq. Damn crybaby.
- Take care, Angunn.
- Yeah. Thank you.
Dinner time, fishies.
Were you able
to get the Medusa video?
Yes. Fouad and Gabriella were here.
- Steal anyone's theses?
- Jeez. Why can't you just trust me?
You realize I've been running up and down
all day long for you!
- Drink it! It's your turn!
- Go!
Take the shot!
Don't be scared.
- Hold on!
- Go, Sur!
You had too much.
Okay. This proves that
he intentionally aimed the Medusa at me.
- You got more?
- Yeah, I think so. Just check again.
I don't wanna go home tonight!
- Drink up! Drink up!
- Let's get wasted!
Sur!
See that?
He got the drink with a different color!
Fuck! I knew it was him the whole time!
Uh...
Sur, you okay? Hey.
- Are you okay?
- I have low blood pressure.
I've been
analyzing Gabriella's video,
I figured out where Tariq was
before he came out with the Medusa's head.
Yes! Whoo!
He came out from this room.
What do you think
Tariq was doing there for so long?
When is this ever gonna end?
You're dead broke.
You can't expect me
to back you up forever.
- When are you going home?
- I'm not going home.
- Look, at least if you go home, you...
- I said I don't wanna!
I've sorted these.
Just so you know,
there are three theses in here.
I can help you sell them.
Bro.
I thought you were retired.
So how many customers today?
Just three.
Oh, shit. He's early.
- Adrian from Tibet?
- Yeah.
- Here for the Russian Lit thesis?
- Uh, yeah, correct.
Okay, yeah, you too.
Text me, okay?
Here.
- Here you go.
- Hold it.
All there.
Here's your cut.
Amin's not here?
He's out delivering documents.
But he'll be back in around half an hour.
I brought
this beef dumpling soup
and some money for my daughter.
Mm.
She's a friend of Amin's.
- What's her name?
- Sur. Suryani.
- Do you know her?
- Yeah, I know her.
- May I borrow your phone?
- One-one-nine. Hold on.
Okay.
It got rejected.
Please let me know
if you hear anything.
- Of course. Okay.
- Here, save my number.
- Thank you, dear.
- You're welcome.
When did he start listening to this crap?
Your soup's downstairs.
This is everything
I've found so far.
These are last year's photos.
Mata Hari was holding
an illegal initiation.
Is there a photo there that shows
you were part of those initiations?
Hold on a second, sir.
Can you see Tariq
putting the drug in his pocket?
Suspiciously he locked himself up
in this room for at least an hour,
and then suddenly
he brought these drinks out,
then he set me up
to drink this specific one.
All these signs point to him
spiking my drink with something.
I mean I literally passed out
shortly afterwards.
Well, this is a serious accusation
you're putting on my table, Suryani.
No matter what you present,
above everything,
your case is about the selfies.
Now where is the evidence
that your selfies were somehow fabricated?
I'm still trying to look
for more evidence.
It'll help speed things up
if the faculty can help...
I know that,
but you can't show me any real evidence,
You do understand
I can't process anything, right?
Indeed, such initiations are illegal,
so I'll take this straight
to the Arts & Culture Faculty
and talk to their dean.
However, that has no bearing on your case.
Because I don't see any...
real evidence.
Off you go.
Attention,
ladies and gentlemen!
This is an important public announcement.
In order to control the unprecedented
dengue fever outbreak in Indonesia,
the government will be providing
free fumigation in the surrounding area.
Please remain inside your house,
close your windows
until the fumigation is finished.
This is the public service
to mitigate the spread
of Aedes mosquitoes in the area.
Exercise mindfulness
to help stop the outbreak.
Always remember the three precaution.
I didn't share any photos!
Those were last year's initiation photos.
You were the photographer!
- Who else could've given them?
- I wasn't the one who gave them!
You lying bitch,
the dean cancelled our Kyoto funding!
What do you have against us?
- Just admit it, Farah.
- It wasn't me, you assholes!
You can get wasted.
Don't you dare drag us down with you.
Go fuck your boys, leave us alone!
I lost my scholarship
because of that initiation!
Say the fuck out of this.
- Huh?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Tariq! Stop it! Stop it!
We're fine. We're still gonna go to Kyoto.
I told them it wasn't an initiation,
but that was part
of an acting workshop. It's fine!
Why did she have to leak those photos?
- Asshole, it wasn't me!
- It wasn't Farah, you idiot!
Stop accusing her!
- Who else?
- I don't know. The dean didn't tell me!
Let it go! What's done is done!
Right now, we have to regain our focus.
You get that?
Farah, I'm really sorry.
We don't mean to accuse you...
Farah!
Enough! Back to work.
Hold on.
What did you mean?
Losing your scholarship
because of the initiation?
Huh?
I lost all control.
Because you spiked my drink!
The fuck do you mean?
Tariq!
Come here! Stop hiding!
Drink it!
What did you put in her drink?
Why'd you give her the glass
with a different color?
- What are you talking about?
- Why'd she pass out after that drink?
- Where did you get these? Who gave these?
- I got them online.
I clearly saw you putting some drugs
in your pocket. What was it?
- Answer her! Right now, Tariq!
- Yeah.
What happened was... Wait!
Why would I put a drug in her drink?
Why would you lock up yourself in there?
You tell me.
- I swear I didn't put anything!
- Stop! Enough!
Let's check the CCTV at my house
and put an end to this.
Rama, please, Rama. You realize
it's just 14 days before we go to Kyoto!
- I got set pieces to ship.
- Tariq, we don't keep secrets from anyone.
If you didn't do anything,
why would you be so reluctant
to check out the footage, huh?
Why don't you check yourself!
I got shipments to organize!
I don't care what you're doing!
I want every single one to come tonight!
I will not have any mistrust among us!
You got that?
Fuck!
Just grab any drink you want.
Okay, let's go to the night of the party.
Fast-forward until
Sur gets the shot from Tariq.
Okay. Rewind a bit.
Why don't you scan over
to the part where he's in that dark room?
Switching to the pantry.
Zoom a bit closer.
See if he put any drugs.
Don't see any drugs.
No drugs being put.
Looks like it's all whiskey.
Rewind it again. Gotta be
a reason he stayed there for so long?
Here.
Drugs my therapist gave me.
Why do you all
have to keep torturing me? Huh?
I always backed you up,
no matter what happened. To support you.
When you all needed something,
who is there for you?
Who do you all whine to? Huh?
- And now, all of a sudden, my privacy...
- Okay, okay.
We're sorry. We never knew, never even
noticed you're under so much pressure.
But this all happened because
you never shared anything to us.
He's right. All this time,
I thought I knew you.
If only I had known you'd been
taking these medications lately.
We are your family,
we're supposed to be your safe place.
Don't be afraid to tell us anything.
Come on, guys, why don't we all
give Tariq a big Mata Hari hug.
What the fuck
is wrong with all of you?
I always have to look okay.
I always have to look I'm fine.
Not everything
has to be treated as if we're family.
Let me do my work and leave me alone!
- No, that's not how it works.
- You too, Anggun.
You know how long
you and I have been working together?
You've known me for how long?
How could you accuse me like that?
And just so you all know,
we lost one working day by coming here!
Just to deal with a bullshit accusation
by some new kid
who doesn't believe she got wasted!
For fuck's sake,
it's only two weeks before we go to Kyoto!
Who's gotta clean up this mess? Me, right?
You all complain about shit
and who do you blame? Me again, right?
"Tariq, do this! Tariq, do that!" "Tariq..."
Well, fuck you, all!
Talking about family and shit?
What a fake fucking family!
Shit!
Riq...
Just let him go.
Let him go. Let him go.
Okay, uh...
Sur.
I think it should be clear now
that Tariq didn't put drugs in your drink.
Okay, listen, guys.
Sur said someone fabricated her selfies.
- Why don't we fast-forward and check that?
- Okay.
Thank you.
Hey, Sur. You thirsty?
Slow it down.
Pause it, Rama.
Well, well.
- I knew she was a liar.
- Looks like she forgot.
Makes sense. She did it by herself.
Let's fast-forward
until Sur goes home, to be sure.
Pause it, Ram.
I took out your wallet then.
So I could see your address,
and book you a NetCar.
Zoom in. It's not your phone.
Nobody touched your phone.
Yep.
Tariq's going home.
And now it's Sur.
Jesslyn, Abu and Kirana are leaving.
After everyone went home, I took off
to take photos of the Milky Way.
For the installation sets' revision.
How is it, Sur?
Satisfied?
Rama...
Can I check one more time?
- I want to take notes, to be sure.
- Come on, Sur.
Why do you all look so serious?
Are you having some meeting?
Hope you're hungry.
My oxtail soup's ready.
Let's eat up!
Yes, Uncle.
- Come on, while it's still hot.
- Come on, I'm hungry.
- Come on.
- Okay. Let's go.
I heard
that oxtail soup was tasty.
Here, Sur.
Do you know how to operate this?
I do.
Damn it! Geez!
Why aren't you eating?
Here you go.
So you won't pass out.
Thank you so much, Uncle.
No need to force her.
My husband's quite pushy.
Aunt.
Everyone who has finished eating,
go back to campus.
I heard little bit of news
about your faculty, Sur.
Can't believe you lost a scholarship
over some selfies.
It's quite an overreaction
Can't you appeal the decision?
Uh, I've already tried that.
I was told that I violated
the moral clause in the contract.
Huh? By what method
do they even measure someone's morality?
If you don't mind me asking,
how much is your tuition fee per semester?
$300.
How many semesters have you done so far?
I still have six more semesters.
This is only my first year.
Six semesters, six times $300,
- that's 1800, right?
- Mm-hmm.
If that's the case,
I'm going to help you pay your tuition.
That's right. I'm being serious.
But next week, I expect you
to start working on our website.
Obviously,
you'll still get paid, of course.
How's that sound?
I'm sorry. I don't want
to trouble you with anything.
Enough. You're bright
with a promising future.
Losing your scholarship because
of drinking is foolish. It's nonsense.
Uncle, Aunt, we're leaving.
We're getting a NetCar.
Hold on a second.
Stay right there. Rama!
- We're fine.
- Drive them. Make sure they get home.
Let him take you.
It's hard to get NetCar here.
Uh, last time it was pretty easy.
Really? It takes hours
to book one and get them here.
This house is too far from the main road.
There are hardly
NetCar drivers in the area.
Please,
just let Rama drive you home.
Ram, drive them home.
Let it go, Sur.
It's normal for people to make mistakes.
Don't overthink it. It's no big deal.
You even got Rama's dad
to pay your tuition.
Things are good. Relax.
Things aren't good until I'm sure.
Using the security footage, I counted
how many drinks I had before I passed out.
How many?
I had four.
Is it possible to pass out
after having just four?
I have to try drinking again.
So if I don't pass out after
having four drinks, then that's proof.
Someone must've drugged
my drink that night.
Hey, hold on. Slow down, Sur.
Don't gulp it like that. Otherwise...
I don't feel anything.
Lighting and ambience are important too.
I'll set it up like in Rama's party.
Sur.
It'd be nice to see the sea right now.
I miss the sea so much.
Look.
I've had three more shots.
And I'm still not feeling anything at all.
Try dancing along, Sur. Come on!
Get up.
I'm still sober.
Sur, drinks are not all the same.
Brands matter.
Rama's booze were all imported brands.
I'll just have to drink more.
I can change the music
to something else if you want.
Hey, check this out, Sur.
Over West Sumatra,
there's a photocopier monument!
Ooh.
I think I drank too much.
My face must be so red.
No, no, don't use a mirror.
Use Amelia instead. Yeah.
Here.
Let's go.
Go on, do it.
- Oh, my God.
- There we go.
- Let's see if she can get your armpits!
- What the fuck!
Now your foot. Your foot.
Can we try all of it?
Where's the switch button?
- So ugly.
- Okay.
Hey, drag me
like Mata Hari's installations.
Only one portion, right?
Yes, sir.
My friend says she's not that hungry.
If the car stopped in this area,
then it could've run over the nails
on the previous block.
Yo. Any tire shops nearby
that are open past midnight?
Really wouldn't know, brother.
I'm only open here in the morning.
What are you staring at?
I thought Rama's dad
was the one who made this statue.
You mean he wasn't?
The signature is different.
But I swear I've seen this statue before.
Just like I thought. Look at this photo
that was in Rama's inbox.
And if it's there, someone sent this photo
of Kendil Park's statue
to Rama that night.
But why, though?
You sure it's not
one of the many statues at Rama's house?
No. This one's clearly different.
It's not one of his dad's.
Did Rama go to Kendil Park that night?
Why would he go there
in the middle of the night?
He said he took his car
right after everyone left the party,
so he could photograph the Milky Way
for the installation.
We can't get a hold of him.
Listen to me.
You should stop depending on Tariq.
Unfortunately, Tariq still hasn't
joined us today for whatever reason.
Doesn't matter if we're missing anyone.
Everyone has their roles,
and I expect you
to do your work well, okay?
Cross-check it all. Yeah?
Yes, Sur. Go ahead.
What if we create
an official email domain for Mata Hari?
So for example, you have
a business card, like, say, Anggun's.
We can write anggun@matahari.com.
How long will it take?
Not long. I'll sort it all out.
I'll send a link to everyone.
You have to type in
your existing email address
and then sign up for the new one.
Fine. All department heads,
do what Sur just said.
Yeah. Now let's go.
Don't waste any more time.
- Hey, Samsul?
- Hey.
Rama mentioned
that he modified the installation.
The Milky Way one.
Yeah, he did. Why?
Can I take a look at it?
Shit. You're late. They're already packed.
Van's gonna pick them up soon.
What do you need them for?
I want to take pictures of them.
For our website.
Oh, in that case, why don't I send you
the raw files that Rama sent me?
Before they were printed on the lightbox.
- You have them?
- Of course I have them. I printed them.
I'll just send you a link later.
Got a shitload to do.
Thanks a bunch.
I'll wait for you to send them.
Sure.
Yo, get the hammer.
There you go.
Your shows video's been uploaded.
Remember when you went home
from the party?
Was it raining?
Yeah, it was. Soon after I left.
I think it was raining all over the city.
I'm buying some cigarettes.
You need anything?
Why'd you close it?
Okay.
One, two, three, four, five...
Okay, look this way, please.
...seven, eight. One, two, three...
Tilt your head up a bit.
I didn't know you can get
their passwords this easily.
You knew how to do this
and you didn't do it much earlier?
Never that simple.
We still need their login approval.
Wouldn't he get a notice
if his email was being hacked?
That's why I need
your help so I can pull this off.
Lure him to print something in here.
Just think of something.
So the exact moment he logs in
with the computer downstairs,
I'll also log in
to his email from this laptop.
He'll get two notices. He won't realize
there's two devices logging in.
He's gonna approve them both.
Are you sure about this?
Doing all this shit again?
His dad's gonna help
pay your college tuition.
What if you're wrong again,
you get caught?
Gotta be more open-minded.
What's wrong if Rama
actually went to that park?
Not everyone wants to harm you.
This will be the last time, I promise.
Then I'll finally be out of your hair.
But before that,
I need to know his location history.
Sorry, Rama.
That script you gave me
accidentally got deleted. I messed up.
How did that happen?
I was doing routine clean up
on the computer,
your script kinda got caught in it.
At least you can access your email now.
The Wi-Fi's fixed.
Okay.
- All done. Should I print it now?
- Uh, nah, no need.
- Shit!
- I got it.
Very good. Thanks.
Trouble paying the bills?
I forgot.
Oh, well.
I've downloaded the files.
You can just check
the download folder, and then...
Just log out my email later, please.
I haven't logged it out yet.
Yeah, I'll take care of all that.
So what about the fishes?
Uh, I still have some.
The red one. Do you want it?
That wasn't the fish
I was talking about.
The one's in the drawer.
I don't know
what do you mean?
Come on, Amin.
I really need them.
I've been stressed.
Uninspired.
You know, the fishes in the drawer,
the exquisite ones,
the ones that inspire me.
Let me know if you have some new fish.
Sur, Rama left. Turn the lights on.
Open the drawer right now.
Or I'll expose you
for selling other people's theses.
What the fuck, Sur?
What's wrong with you? Huh?
What are you hiding in the drawer?
- Are you selling drugs?
- No! What the hell?
Then open it now!
Or I'm sending this to the dean.
You'll get fired.
- Hurry up! Open it!
- Yeah, I'm on it!
- You see any drugs?
- What's this then?
That's just my...
That's my hard drive!
What was Rama talking about?
You ungrateful piece of shit.
Can't believe
I went back to selling theses
to help you with your stupid vendetta.
What are you trying to achieve here?
Why do you have all these photos?
What are they for?
Sur... Uh... Sur! Sur! Sur! Sur!
Early this year, my sister got sick.
Dengue fever.
She was hospitalized. I needed money.
Rama asked me
to steal some of the students' data.
I got $50 for every student.
That's all, I swear!
It's not as bad as it looks.
I checked all the photos!
I make sure
there are no nudes or anything.
They're normal pics that everyone takes.
Rama only needs them
so he can get a little inspiration.
I swear, that's all.
You've seen how it helps.
You guys won, right?
- You're going to Kyoto!
- Bastard!
I did nothing wrong!
Eight hours, please.
$8. $1 per hour.
Did you have anything to eat?
Pick a thing. I got it.
No, it's okay. I'm good, thanks.
Hey. Two iced teas
and another plate of noodles.
Gotcha.
Why are you hiding from your mother?
What? Did you run away?
Got a bunch of problems.
Your scholarship?
You said you lost your scholarship
because of the initiation?
- I wanted to ask...
- I've told you from the get-go.
You didn't believe me back then.
It's better to focus on your studies.
Actually there's
something I wanted to ask you.
Did you ever model for Mata Hari
back when you were with them?
What do you mean?
That's your tattoo, isn't it?
- What makes you think that?
- It is, isn't it?
Where did you get that?
Because mine's here too.
It's a photo of my back.
I asked you a question.
Where did you get those photos?
Have you been hacking me or something?
You leaked those
initiation photos, didn't you?
But this is your tattoo, isn't it?
If it's yours, we can report this
to the ethics board.
Stop it. There's no use.
If we testify together,
we'll have much stronger evidence.
They're not gonna
stand a chance. Help me...
Stop!
I would like to
submit this evidence to the board.
Photos of Rama's installation.
Photos of my back.
And the metadata showing that these photos
were taken at 2:00 in the morning.
The same time
my NetCar stopped at the park.
Hmm.
Are you 100% sure
these are photos of your back?
If you have any more additional evidence,
it could be useful
for bolstering our investigation.
- No. That's all, sir.
- All right then.
I'll form a team specifically
for this investigation.
I'll call some of the university's admins.
They can help us out.
Do you have any, uh, digital files
of this physical evidence?
I do.
- I can send you a copy.
- Okay, that'll help.
Sir, I'm worried about my safety.
Can I remain anonymous?
Of course. That's a given, actually.
It's part of our procedure.
We keep your identity confidential
all throughout the investigation.
Hello?
These documents you gave,
did you fabricate them?
- Hmm?
- Rama Soemarno contacted us.
He's expressed concerns.
He's on the way here with his lawyer.
It's a serious matter.
He wants to go to the police and file
a report against you for defamation.
Why's he filing against me?
These documents that you submitted
have popped up online
and somehow gone "viral" in our campus.
And that is why Rama's filing a lawsuit.
Sir, I never shared them
or made them viral!
I gave them to the ethics board so they
can proceed with the investigation.
They should be held responsible for this!
I understand, I understand.
The fact is, you're the one
who prepared these documents.
And listen,
I do not want the university
to get dragged into this case
if this does go to court.
Also our faculty is going to be sending
the Mata Hari off to Japan soon.
Meaning, we don't want this case
to jeopardize that trip.
I've already talked to Rama personally,
so we can try and find a way
to amicably resolve this issue peacefully.
Sir, please, you need to listen to me!
Sir.
Please forgive my daughter.
She makes mistakes
like any other person her age.
Please, take a seat first,
and we'll discuss this with you.
Please, sir. Just have a seat.
But, sir...
Let's just settle this here. Right here.
My daughter's the one who's out of line.
I'll punish her myself.
Sir, take a seat so we can begin.
Let us explain.
I never made those documents viral!
I submitted them to the ethics board
so there'd be an investigation!
If it's suddenly gone viral,
it's their fault!
Calm down.
You prepared those documents
and shared them to a lot of people online.
Now Rama Soemarno
is being labelled by people
as a rapist, a creep, a wile pervert!
Her actions irreversibly
ruined my client's reputation.
You boldly tried
to hack into my client's mobile phone.
Everything you've done is against the law!
I have evidence.
- Please, forgive my daughter.
- Stop apologizing, Dad!
Look at this photo over here.
It's the one used
for Mata Hari's installation sets.
It was taken at 2:00
when my NetCar stopped at the park.
It's a photo of my back!
Sur, you shut up!
Sir, calm down.
Let's all settle down. Please.
Sur.
- That's not a photo of your back.
- I want these investigated thoroughly.
Let's take these to the forensics team.
And we can check the other installations.
These were taken without my consent!
I know that you're still distressed
after you lost your scholarship.
- I took the photos at 2:00...
- Let me take care of this.
But she definitely needs
to know the truth.
I took pictures of the stars.
Those are photos of the night sky.
The Milky Way.
What's your proof then?
It was raining all over Jakarta.
You couldn't have seen the sky!
Sur.
You were heavily intoxicated that night.
Have you sobered up?
Or are you still hallucinating now?
That's why I need
all the help to investigate this!
All right then.
If Sur insists, we have no choice,
but to take this to court.
And if we do take this case to court, Sur,
you'll be facing every single individual
mentioned or related to those documents.
That includes NetCar party.
Sir. Please, as much as possible,
let's try to reach an agreement here
so we can keep this problem
contained internally.
- Please, I'm begging you.
- Dad, stop it!
- Why are you on your knees begging?
- Shut up! Just shut up!
You've been making mistakes.
When are you ever going to learn?
Sir. Please, sir.
Stand up.
What I need is nothing more
than a clarification.
- Rama, please. I'll handle it.
- Let me speak.
Family. In the Mata Hari family,
we always support each other.
Please let me take it from here.
We still consider Sur
as a part of our theater family.
We would prefer
to solve this issue as a family would.
We're currently swamped
preparing a show for Kyoto.
Everyone's stressed out as it is.
All I want is for Sur to make a sincere
public apology and clarification.
Then after that, tomorrow,
we can go back to being
a family again in the theater.
Sir, ma'am. If you're worrying
about Sur's scholarship,
my father has agreed to pay
for Sur's tuition until she graduates.
Also, she can still work for my father,
doing what she does best
while receiving her salary.
I'm going to proceed with the case!
Suryani, that's enough!
I, Suryani,
would like to make
a sincere apology to Rama Soemarno.
I had recently made
various false accusations against him.
And if somehow all my allegations,
or hypothesis
have damaged Rama Soemarno's reputation,
and that of other parties,
I would like to clarify
that not a single one of them was factual.
I apologize
and earnestly promise
that I won't do such
an irresponsible thing anymore.
Rama Soemarno's family and I
have all agreed
to resolve and settle this case amicably,
outside the court system and reconcile.
...would like to make
a sincere apology to Rama Soemarno.
I had recently made
various false accusations against him.
And if somehow all my allegations...
- Learn how to use the lights!
- Mom? Where are we going?
What's going on?
You're my daughter, Sur.
My flesh and blood.
When you were holding
those photos earlier,
I knew immediately...
it was the birthmark on your back.
Sur.
Please tell me everything.
What did they do to you?
It's been a week.
That's right.
Oh, so It's unobtainable?
Yati, Sur.
I called the lab just now.
Just like I suspected.
It's highly unlikely that they'll find
any trace of sedative in your urine.
Because it's already more than three days.
I didn't do it then.
I was scared to take a urine test.
There were drugs at the party.
They have a discretion policy.
The lab will never disclose
your test result.
You don't need to worry
about anyone knowing it.
In the meantime, if you and Sur
would like to stay here for the moment,
at least while you're gathering evidence,
you're very welcome.
Sur, you should stay here for now.
It's useless to be around your father.
What about you, Mom?
Well, I have to go home, Sur.
Who's gonna run the diner?
And don't worry. I'm not gonna
let your dad lay a hand on me.
Make sure if anything happens,
you call me right away at any cost.
Siti, please take care of my daughter.
- I'm going to leave you some money.
- Don't worry, Yati.
- I'll call some friends to help us.
- Hello.
Sur.
Those are my tattoos.
Sorry I didn't help you back then.
Also, I brought someone else here.
His body was
in Rama's installation sets like us.
It was after
my mother passed away.
Therapist told me
it'd be good to do activities.
Thank you, Miss Siti.
That son of a bitch was like family to me.
I've never, in my entire life,
showed this scar to anyone.
Must have taken a picture of it
when I was wasted.
I was in denial.
Didn't wanna losing any more family.
Rama was the one
who introduced me to Mata Hari.
The activities helped me
get over an abusive relationship.
I went to Mata Hari's parties as well.
I was their official photographer.
I enjoy drinking.
That night, I felt
a whole lot dizzier than usual.
After only two glasses.
I should've been completely blacked out
if he actually drugged me.
So it was weird.
But I was a drinker.
Guess that made me
more resistant to sedatives.
And I remember...
At one point, I was taken into a car,
and I saw someone approaching towards me.
All of my clothes were stripped slowly...
then I heard
the camera shutters start clicking.
I wrote everything right here.
How come you never
told anyone about this before?
I did.
They all told me
it was all in my ditzy drunk head.
That what I heard
was just bottles clinking.
"Don't you usually get laid
right away after drinking?"
They told me
that I was just making things up.
So I decided to leave Mata Hari.
Do you remember if at that time,
you and Tariq
also went home in a NetCar?
They told me that I did.
Did you remember details
about the driver or the car?
Unfortunately, I don't.
I don't even know
who booked the car for me.
- I have a pictures of my NetCar.
- Let me see.
Here, this one.
Nope. Doesn't look familiar to me.
Stop, stop. Zoom in a bit.
That say Komodo Parking Lot to you?
What are the odds this NetCar and Rama
are somehow connected?
Rama's house is far and it's really hard
to get a NetCar there.
You mean like a fake NetCar?
No. The driver was from NetCar.
It made Rama seem innocent.
He could've been asked to roam around
or stand by next to Rama's house.
So if a booking was made, he'd get it.
What I have so far,
is all these pictures
of Kendil Park's statue from Rama's inbox.
But I don't know who sent them to him.
The only way we can find more evidence
is by checking the driver's phone.
But you already met him before.
He'll remember the moment he sees you?
Then he'll warn Rama right away.
How about I do it?
No one has ever ordered me
a NetCar whenever I was drunk.
Are you sure?
Thanks, Miss Siti. You take care.
What's with you? Feeling sleepy?
Go have some coffee.
Definitely.
Hey.
How was your day,
my little princess, huh?
Oh.
Ah. I'll go and get some rest first.
Excuse me.
- Hey!
- Hmm?
- Burhan.
- Yeah?
Ah. Good afternoon, sir.
I'm from the Mata Hari theater group.
You may have heard.
I was instructed by Rama Soemarno
to go to this address
and give this to Mr. Burhanuddin.
Well, are you sure it's the right address?
This is along Komodo Street, right?
Oh, no. Komodo Street
is up there, not here.
Let me see the address.
Give it here.
I don't see an address
written on this thing.
Actually I was instructed by Rama
to go to Komodo Street
to give this to a Mr. Burhanuddin.
So I asked people around here
if they knew who you were,
and someone did,
so they told me to come here.
Basically, our group won
a national theater competition.
We'd like to celebrate by delivering gifts
for friends or anyone who's helped us.
I see. That's why.
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah.
Uh, sorry, ma'am.
Um, may I, uh... Can I borrow
a charger for my phone just for a minute?
My phone died on the way here.
I need to book for a car so I can go home.
What? Why do you need a cab for?
Didn't you drive here?
No, I, uh...
My friends dropped me off
and went on to deliver other parcels.
Where are you going anyway?
To BSD city, sir.
Maybe I can take
an offline order, if you want.
That'd be great.
I can just pay you with cash.
Okay.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.
Uh, sir,
may I use your phone for a bit?
I just need to call a friend.
Oh, sorry, but I can't.
Because my battery is too low.
And I can't make
any booking if my phone is dead.
I left the charger at home.
Really sorry, kid.
Yeah, this tire isn't looking so good.
May I use your phone?
I'm gonna call a repair shop?
Ah, don't worry. It's fine.
NetCar Center could help us out.
NetCar's office is far from here, sir.
I'm kind of in a rush.
This tire looks perfect.
I'll just call a mechanic nearby.
No need to get a new tire.
How about it? Just let me call him.
How about you and I
change the tire together right now?
Kid, can you help me lift this tire?
I can't do it by myself.
I thought you said
you could change a tire all by yourself.
Riq?
Uh, Tariq, what did you do to him?
Come in.
Please watch over him, Miss Siti.
We're gonna have
to take this man to the police.
Come on. We need to act quickly now.
He already texted Rama earlier.
Mr. Burhan,
I'm all done here now.
The technician should be here soon.
After you change the tire,
just take Sur home immediately.
Understood. Yeah.
Just leave it to me.
Okay.
So what we have in this phone
are the eight videos he secretly recorded.
There's one of you, Farah.
One of Tariq.
One of me, and then five other girls.
All of it happened in his car.
No, there could be more.
It might've happened
to everyone you saw in Amin's hard drive.
You call every victim in the video
and tell them to come here.
We're going straight to the police.
Don't forget Burhan's car. We need it.
We'll bring it along as evidence, okay?
You wanna go to the police?
Our videos would go viral fast!
Sur, that's a recipe for disaster.
Have you learned anything? Huh?
Didn't you see how rich Rama's dad is?
You stole data from people, Sur.
You hacked their phones.
We beat up and abducted the driver!
Talk to the cops, we go to jail!
Why did you fuck up the plan earlier?
Beating him up like some stupid damn thug.
We're not alone anymore.
We do this together,
our evidence is stronger, okay?
What if we still lose?
And the videos go viral?
Our bodies are gonna be out there
for people to see
like we're zoo animals forever.
And what's the campus gonna do?
You don't think they'll back that fucker?
You see what our friends did?
They copied our videos
instead of helping us!
I've been holding this back for months.
It'll be even worse
to see that bastard walking free.
You're gonna miss him?

- Thank you, Miss Siti.
- We need to use the eyedrops.
This is all the evidence
that we have left.
Pieces of paper.
The rest are nothing but stories.
So what do you think?
Is anyone gonna believe us?
That tattoo on your back,
what does it mean?
"Even in the darkest hour,
I decided to keep fighting."
