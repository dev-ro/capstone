As long as you were nothing but
an apprentice beautician...
You let me pluck roses
in your garden.
But now that you've passed
a Party course...
...you snub your intimate
proletarian friends!
That's a slanderous lie, you
irresponsible element!
You are a revolting remnant of...
...our glorious past,
comrade Radmilovic!
There is no God!
There is no State, and the people
are about finished!
Control yourself, comrade!
There's no going back!
Stop, you fat Mercedes!
Know whose it is, jerk?
You stay out of it!
Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!
Steak Erterhazy! Mitsuko Perfume!
MARX FACTOR!
Our position as women
is still unresolved!
Radmilovic...
There's a living specimen
of proletarian decadence!
That is my tragedy!
I am a hapless female.
I have drained my bitter cup
to the dregs!
I'll never let any man
trample over me again!
Oh, I see we have company!
It's comrade Ljuba.
He came for a little rest.
He didn't even finish his tea.
Ever ready, our military!
Ah, the People's Army!
My ONE goes off like a gun!
My TWO is a bolt from the blue!
"THE COMMUNIST"
"HOW KARL MARX FELL IN LOVE"
The military hasn't been layed
in 6 months!
Communism without Free Love
is a wake in a graveyard!
Screw you all!
Down with the Red Bourgeoisie!
Attacking a fellow worker!  
Workers of the world... 
I know why he erected
that wonderful barricade!
It's because I won't allow him
any further intimacies.
Will you be...
...long?
We just got started.
You room-mate
is having sex again!
Disgraceful!
Mind your own business!
With their rumps right in my eye?
What's it to you?
Our youth shouldn't
exhaust itself!
Freedom...
...and love are inexhaustible, Madam!
Your "love" is nothing but
an athletic contest!
It's carnal love... Abstinence is un-
healthy, inhuman and what's worse...
...counter-revolutionary!
To me it's just a fuckfest!
Onward People's Soldiers!
Sex writers foolishly debate
which are better:
...short thick ones
or long thin ones.
I say it's a false dilemma!
Don't trust the media!
Pleasure is what counts.
A pleasing one is best.
Any child knows where the sweet
spot is: between the legs!
Our road to the future...
...must be Positive!
Comrades!
Between Socialism and physical
love there can be no conflict!
Socialism must not exclude human
sensual pleasure from its program!
The October Revolution was ruined
when it rejected Free Love!
War of Liberation!
Frustrate the young sexually...
...and they'll recklessly take
to other illicit thrills...
...pilfering, burglary and
assorted crimes...
...knifings, alcoholism, political
riots with flags flying...
...battling the police...
like pre-war Communists!
What we need is a free youth
in a crime-free world!
If we are to achieve this,
we must allow...
FREE LOVE!
Maria!... Give it to me!
Gentlemen, in our Democracy...
...everyone is entitled to a
doughnut... Some get the...
...doughnut.
Others get the hole
in the doughnut.
It would seem that...
...the main problem...
...is the hole!
There's your
class-structured society!
Males stop being men and
turn into common swine!
So we're all idiots?
Yes!
Idiocy is the right word
for your condition...
You're resigned to your social 
and sexual misery!
I'll stuff my idiot into you!
You beasts... You screw drunken
whores in toilets!
You're under-payed!
Your wives and children have no
respect for you fuckless fools!
You've taught your children that
sex-play will rot their spines!
She's right!
And you'd know it if you read the pamphlet...
"WHY SERBIAN CHILDREN WASTE AWAY"
No excitement can ever equal the
elemental force of the orgasm!
That's why politics attract
those of us whose orgasm...
...is substandard... defective...
...disturbed or premature.
Ejaculatio precox!
Shame on you!
That's YOUR problem!
Real men know how to live
their lives...
...without asking
anyone's permission!
Sweet oblivion is
the masses' demand!  
Deprive them of sweet love, and
they'll seize everything else. 
That led to Revolution... It led
to Fascism and Doomsday.
"HOW MAN BECAME A GIANT"...
"DEUTSCHLAND UBER ALLES!"
The goose-stepping,
mass-marching orgasm!
The bloodstream orgasm of the
alcoholic, or the junkie.
The cerebral orgasm of dogmatists
or religious mystics!
The muscular orgasm of compulsive
workers, athletes or artists!
Deprive youth of their right to
the sweet electricity of sex... 
...and you rob them
of their mental health.
Children and youth
are entitled to... 
...the happiness of
the genital embrace.
Back to our own,
our true human nature!
Restore to every individual
the right...
...TO LOVE!
Freedom for the individual
is freedom for all!
Without love
Life isn't worth a thing
Without love
Without love
Life isn't worth a thing
Nobody knows... Oh, nobody knows
What tomorrow may bring
Life without fucking
Life without fucking
Isn't worth a thing!
They claimed...
...that after the working class...
...had overthrown
the bourgeois system...
...it would be incapable of
creating anything new.
We have demonstrated...
...our ability, not only to
destroy the old order... 
...but to build in its place
a new socialist order! 
Under the sacred banner...
...of our great Lenin...
...we will faithfully carry out...
...every directive
he bequeathed to us.

Wonderful!
Socialist art!
Gorgeous Czarist costumes!
They're so healthy and handsome!
We're Artillerymen.
I'm Ljuba the cock: I mount guard
by day and girls by night.
Overnight pass every Saturday.
Give me some. 
My THREE is a spree!
My FOUR likes to score!
I'm epileptic... Certified.
We're bi-sexual.
My FIVE takes a dive!
My SIX knows all the tricks!
Vladimir Ilich.
Consider yourself protected by
the Yugoslav People's Army.
But who'll protect me from you?
You're so fuckable!
That's what they all say.
Spasibo!
Thank you, comrade Artist!
As a souvenir, please.
I am Milena.
You are a great artist.
Mine is a great country.
We have very many talented people.
In your dancing I found much 
work, love and science.
But it's all so... erotic!
My SEVEN goes to heaven!
My EIGHT never comes late!
Never?
Want to try?
What you said before...
Were you teasing me?
Oh, no!
God forbid!
More company!
This time we have a champion...
...figure-skating artist... He holds
the rank of People's Artist
Being best in his sport, 
naturally he is a Communist.
I'm her room-mate, Jagoda.
Delighted... Vladimir Ilich.
Are you a real Russian?
Or perhaps a Jew?
Or Lithuanian or something?
Jewish, and Lithuanian 
as well... Oh, no!
To us nationality means nothing.
Only work and achievement count.
My occupation is People's Artist.
I'm a Socialist Artist
and champion ice-skater.
I am... We are proud
of our achievements.
Wow!
Just look at him!
You're an artist...
A People's Artist!
A Socialist champion ice-skater
who can really toe the line!
The sporting type!
My greatest triumphs were the Scala 
in Milan... 
...and Madison Square Garden.
Look...
...that West of theirs
is highly over-rated!
True, they've achieved
marvels in production.
They have the wonderful
American dream.
But no personal happiness!
How is that doing in YOUR country?
Why, between...
...personal happiness...
...and our country's and
people's happiness...
...there is no difference!
We abolished the difference.
We Yugoslavians make a distinction.
We hardly know what
personal happiness is.  
Never mind the people's 
or the country's.
We Russians... we do respect
your efforts...
...to find your own way.
You're a proud and
independent people.
But we are confident...
...you will learn from
your own experience...
..that our way is best!
Time will tell who is
closer to the best way.
"The one closest to you 
will betray you."
Excuse me...
That is a photo montage,
isn't it?
No, it's authentic.
It was photographed by the
Nazi Hugo Jaeger in 1939.
There was...
...a fluid in the air,
Jaeger said.
And then something monstrous
began to happen.
Thousands of men and women...
...suddenly started trembling...
...and weeping.
He simply...
...sat there...
...and just... looked at them.
I'm sorry but I don't understand.
Why do you keep...
...that hideous photograph?
Look at those women!
Those stupid cows, those slaves!
They love... honor...
and obey authority!
They endow authority...
...with the primordial power...
...of sex!
Thanks to them...
...this inhuman...
...this bestial force
can be made to seem...
...humane.
With their...
...blind allegiance,
with their irrationality...
...women support...
...every ideological
delusional dream! 
I admire your passion but 
consider it unwarranted.
After all, we're Communists!
Who are you, really?
What are the tasks of our Youth...
...Associations?
We call ourselves Communists.
Why?... What is Communism?
"Communist" is a Latin word.
The eye and mind 
of every Communist...
...must be keen as a scalpel.
And his every word sharp
as a sabre... or...
...an ice-skate!
And his every action precise...
...as a razor cut!
"Communist" implies "communal".
A Communist society means...
...that everything is in common.
The land, factories, labor...
Everything in common.
Will you have some cookies?
And how about some milk?
There...
That's Communism!
His name is world revolution.
He died in an American prison...
...convinced that Moscow 
agents put him there.
How can you say that 
so causally!
What I wonder is whether
they were the same people...
...who went to Mexico and drove 
a pick-ax inte the skull of...
...Trotsky, the comrade-in-arms
of Lenin and Stalin.
One has to be sure of something! 
Yes, for example,
who one's father is...
...or the people who rule over us.
I'm a romantic.
I claim there's no real
revolution without free love!
I understand.
Kolentai's theory: - The Revolution
must destroy marriage.
Yes, bourgeois marriage...
...is nothing but
licensed prostitution!
Radmilovic! You drunken pig!
Intellectuals, let go!
Radmilovic, get out!
No trespassing allowed!
Get moving!
He teaches that every person,
every nice person...
...like you and me...
hides behind his facade...
...a great explosive charge...
...a great reservoir of energy...
...that can be released
only by war or revolution!
In me...? Me too?
Love and crime...! Give me some!
I'm charmed by your enthusiasm...
...so excuse me if I'm a bit ironical.
But...
...doesn't your...
...I mean his theory...
...turn Trotsky's concept of...
permanent Revolution...
...into one (God forbid!)
of permanent orgasm?
Here comes the veteran
shockworker Radmilovic!
My apologetics!
Vladimir Ilich.
Having company?
Oh, Calcutta!
Death to Fascism!
Freedom to the people!
Radmilovic, I'll murder you!
What are you doing?
Free the People's Artist!
Screw the People's Artist!
He's a Champion and a Communist!
I want to screw you!
Is that singular or plural?
Coming back from work
our faces all aglow
Worker-heroes of Tito!
Death to Male Fascism!
Freedom for Female People!
Jim Buckley
Nancy Godrey
It is utter nonsense...
...to talk about a free,
People's State.
For a time, the proletariat
needs the State.
Not in the interest of freedom,
but in order to subdue its enemies.
And when it has become possible...
...to really speak of freedom...
...the State as such will
have ceased to exist!
Well, I've been to the East 
and I've been to the West...
...but it was never like this!
Wonderful!
Granny, Stalin!
Comrades, we have successfully com-
pleted the first stage of Communism!
We Thank the Party
Our Glorious Party
For Bringing Happiness

I live for my Art!
A man can't fritter away 
his life aimlessly.
He must be committed... aim at a
single target, like a spear...
...fly like an arrow!
Look out!
My work requires all of me, 
all that I can give.
One cannot live half-heartedly.
There is no honour in dying 
for love, It is selfish...
...bourgeois.
It's brustishly zoological!
I like being here!
I confess there's much
I don't understand.
But your people are wonderful!
Including the women?
That man slammed his head 
through a wall for you!
I couldn't care less!
The air is as fresh as music!
Nothing is lovlier
than the Apassionata!
I could listen to it all day!
Marvelous, superhuman music.
With perhaps naive pride,
I think:
What wonders men can create!
But I can't listen to music...
It gets on my nerves!
It arouses a yearning in me
to babble about nothing...
...to caress the people,
living in this hell...
...who can still create 
such beauty.
But these days...
...if you stroke somebody's head,
he'll bite off your hand!
Now, you have to hit 
them on the head...
...hit them in the
head mercilessly...
...though in principle
you oppose all violence!
TO LENIN
Workers and peasants
the world over...
...are determined to protect
the Soviet Republic...
...as an arrow shot by the
sure hand of Comrade Lenin...
...toward the camp of the enemy.
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
Forgive me!
You love all mankind...
Yet you're incapable of
loving one individual...
...one single living creature.
What is this love that makes
you nearly knock my head off?
You said I'm lovely
as the Revolution
You gazed at me like at a picture...
But "Revolution" mustn't touch!
What's a baby to a male?
A matter of a second!
Everything else is
the womans's job!
Meanwhile you put your body
at the service of Art!
Your magic flood-lit figure seves
the needs of the masses!
A bunch of lies is what
you're serving...
...the people and the Party!
A toy balloon is what it is...
not a Revolution!
A petty human lie dressed up...
...as a great...
historical truth!
Are you capable...
...are you capable,
you rotten louse...
...of serving the needs
of the species...
...by taking the one
basic position...
...for an ecstatic flight
to the target...
...like an arrow...
...or a vigorously...
...hurled...
...spear?

What's in the hopper today?
It was 200 yards upstream
from where the body was found.
Such a cute girl.
Such a pretty little head.
Chopped off by something very
sharp... an ax or a cleaver...
God damn!
Yes... It must have been a 
very violent blow.
This pretty head to lost its body
with a single blow by her partner.
Her vagina contained a huge 
amount of semen... 
...three or four times 
more than normal.
Any clues at the scene 
of the crime?
Could it have been a gang rape?
Based on the evidence...
...I doubt she was gangbanged
or even raped.
It was more likely
a wild night of love!
No sign of a struggle...
...therefore she received
the semen willingly.
Better check with 
the mental hospitals...
...in case som sex-starved
patient has escaped.
Have you found the murder weapon?
Yes, these nickel-plated Champions.
They're the finest made.
Cosmic rays...
...streamed through 
our carnal bodies.
We pulsated to the vibrations
of the universe.
But he couldn't bear it.
He had to go one step further.
Vladimir is a man of
noble impetuousness...
...a man of high ambition...
...of immense energy.
He's romantic...
...ascetic...
...a genuine Red Fascist!
Comrades...
...even now I'm not ashamed 
of my Communist past!
Before the earth stops turning
Before the lights grow dim
To each one, Lord, I pray Thee
Grant what is needful to him.
To the wise one, a ready wit 
To the coward a horse, pray do
To the fortunate, some money 
But remember, I'm here too.
While the world is still turning 
Lord, you are omnipotent
Let those striving for power 
Wield it to their heart's content.
Give a break to the generous 
At least for a day or two
Pray, give Cain repentance 
And remember me, too.
O Lord, Thou art all-knowing
I believe in Thy wisdom then
As the fallen soldier believes 
In heaven he's alive again
As every ear believes
Thy quiet word as true
As all men must believe
They know not what they do
Oh Lord, oh my sweet Lord 
My blue eyed Lord, You're good!
While the world is still turning 
Wondering why it should
While it has got sufficient fire 
And time, as You see
Give each a little of something 
And remember about me.
Give each a little of something 
And remember about me.
Give each a little of something 
And remember about me.
