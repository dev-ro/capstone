After Hitler occupied
Czechoslovakia and declared
the area Slovakstatt,
the persecution policy was
adopted by Tis' regime.
On the eve of 1942
Tony!
Tony!
Tony, are you at home?
Tony! Where are you?
Did you take the trough
to Mrs. Firic?
Do you know how many tons
of ships the British sunk today?
1What?
Or were British ships sunk?
And did she pay you?
Well, I told her: Mrs. Firic,
you can be sure that a trough
made by me is waterproof.
And the money?!
Is that all?
- She gave me a pair of pigeons.
- What a bargain!
Do you think I can pay my bill
at the grocer's with the pigeons?
Put your tools away!
Are you asleep, or what?
Are you listening?
Tony! What are you
gawking at over there?
I'm putting the tools away.
Did you see the lovely structure
going up on the square?
The height of it! And
so many people around it.
The whole town talks
of nothing else.
Even Little Tibie is working
at the site,
I even saw old lame Frank there,
even Dzurilla, and Kamenicky.
That's nonsense...
you don't understand anything.
I don't understand?
Didn't I tell you:
they are building the monument
without even Mr. Brtko's help?
And there it is!
The hell they are! I wonder
where they got the money from.
The money? Just go and see
for yourself!
I'll go when I feel like going.
Of course, you know best.
You are too stuck-up to go
and see your own brother-in-law.
Tell Mark, others are fighting
at the front.
Let me help.
You'll make lots of money.
- We could live well.
- To hell with Mark!
You'd be sick to use
the Fascist greeting, what?
I am not a parrot.
You think your arm would go numb
if you raised it in greeting?
At your service, madam!
Everybody else is smarter
than you!
- Shut up!
- What?
The workshop!
It's a waste of time talking
to you! As if you were deaf...
Essenc! Come on!
Where are you going now?
Dress myself to look real smart,
for my beloved, my sweetheart
To hell with her...
she keeps ordering me about.
Go to town - go!
Go to the workshop - go!
Nothing but go, go, go!
Look who's here!
Run away, Essenc, no!
Gloria in excelsis Deo!
Amen
Hello, Mr. Blumenfeld!
Good day to you!
Essenc! Where's your master?
Hey, Tony! Now what's wrong?
Are you cross with me?
- I'm in a hurry.
- You're always in a hurry!
Come... I want to have
a word with you!
That wooden monument won't
run away!
You know what I mean.
It's a dirty job...
I have only one arm and one soul -
but I advise you,
most sincerely,
keep your hands off that dirty
business! Fascist politics.
Geza, I left my money at home.
Essenc! Beg nicely!
Well, that's nice! Here.
Slowly! Slowly!
Over to the right!
Welcome, Brtko!
Hey, boss! Did you come
to give us a hand?
You can do your work alone!
Have you come to inspect
the work, Tony?
Just a little... good afternoon,
Mr. Kuchar!
And what do you think of
our wooden "Tower of Babylon?"
Nice job! You won't find
another one like it.
By tomorrow, we'll be
able to stretch our hands out
and touch the stars!
You are joking, Mr. Kuchar!
I am not... I don't want to risk
my pension.
There's nothing new under
the sun, my friend.
There were Pharaohs -
and pyramids before.
- Who?
- Pharaohs!
But it's all ashes now...
and only shame is left.
These are serious things,
Mr. Kuchar.
Yes, very serious, very.
Take 50 cubic meters of wood
at 1500 crowns
that is three times five.
Yes, but people get good wages!
Don't you?... You are a skilled
carpenter, aren't you?
Yes... but I have a nagging wife.
Remember, Mr. Kuchar, when
I made that gate for you?
What I need right now are some
good materials.
His Excellency is coming! Have
you been waiting for him, Tony?
I'd better go now!
What are you running away for?
Wait.
Are you scared of your own
brother-in-law?
He can go to the devil -
my own brother-in-law.
Hold on! If you wait long enough,
you may see the day!
Look how fat he's grown.
All those pig-slaughters
and the good wine!
He's as fat as a bishop!
Never mind a bishop?
An archbishop!
The local god.
To me he is the same as ever.
A good-for-nothing loafer -
the bigshot commander!
If I had a
brother-in-law like him,
I'd get a cushy job myself.
Well, smile at him!
Smile, will you?
Well - what is it?
Laudatur!
Essenc!
We are going!
What have I ever done
to deserve such a husband?
Move off, you beast - you are
as bad as your master!
Shut up!
Good evening!
What - cat got your tongue?
Rosie!
Here you are, Tony!
Some medicine for you! Catch!
Oh, God!
- Just look at him!
Help! Help! The deluge!
Save your souls!
Now look what he's done...
just like a baby.
So what? Splashing about
like a child, splashing.
You do have funny ideas, Mark!
Forgive this mess -
I'll clean it up right away.
Don't stand like a statue
in the puddle!
Let's have a rag and a broom,
hurry up! A rag!
I don't want you to do that!
I told him not to soak his feet
in the kitchen but in the yard
but he just won't listen.
Here! And wipe it well!
Rosie, my dear.
All this work is our fault.
Of course not! That's nothing.
I always said to Tony: Watch out,
blood is thicker than water.
What's all the fuss about!
Look what I've got! Look!
You've never seen so much food
in your life.
Like in the delicatessen's
shopwindow!
But that's nothing, Evelyn.
Mark came home
from the office and said:
Hurry up, Rosie,
we're going out to visit people.
I said, visit whom?
Tony and Evelyn, he said.
We can't put it off any longer.
Of course he didn't have
to ask me twice!
Hell and damnation,
we forgot the caviar at home!
Rum!
Hurry up, Tony, get the glasses!
From the sideboard!
We shouldn't have come without
the caviar!
What a thing to do!
We shouldn't have!
Let me see your hat.
Did you buy it
at the Modiste's on main street?
So beautiful!
Hey, look! It's a fire!
Christ! Water...
get water, quickly!
Tony, don't just dance around!
Bravo, Tony, bravo...
you'll make a fine fireman!
Well, my dears...
Our time has come at last!
We've got good times,
plenty of food and drink,
thank God,
and our freedom too.
Let's live in peace and unity,
as befits an honorable and
decent family!
Let's drink to that!
Isn't he sweet?
Well said, Mark!
Long live our wives!
Well, Tony? Shall we drink
another glass?
Pour it out and let's drink
to your carpenter Patron Saint!
There's an old saying that
two glasses help you sing,
three help you to embrace
and five help you to quarrel.
Let's forget it, Tony!
What's past is past,
let's drown it in rum,
sliwowitz or terkelitz...
Whatever you want!
And we'll be happier than
we ever were! Cheers!
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!
Tony, do we have to beg you
on our knees?
Aren't you drinking, Tony?
Drink it up, or you'll
make me cross...
I am all right...
I even feel like drinking.
What did you say that old saying
was... with the... glasses?
I can't even remember.
- Three glasses help you what?
- To sing.
Yes... well, let's drink the way
our fathers did before us.
Only I guess they didn't
have much. They were poor
but we are rich
and get richer!
Bottoms up!
I keep blowing my whistle...
dad has a right to squeeze mum.
I keep blowing my whistle...
I'll squeeze you too
when we are wed
Rosie, my dear, how are we ever
going to pay you back?
Sit down, stop showing off!
Stop showing off!
Wait! Now I'm going to tell you.
Why don't you leave him?
Let him talk, he's charming!
Come on, Tony, say it,
don't mind her!
We are a free country now.
You can speak!
I won't if you order me to!
Stop it, Tony!
But my dear Tony, say what
you've got to say,
that's what we are here for!
You have the floor! Speak!
I have the floor - whether
you want to or not, you know?
It's true, you've pleased us
with so many presents.
You've no reason to complain!
Only... what I'd like to know...
you devil, my benefactor
who will reimburse me
for my inheritance?
That's what I've been
waiting for!
Yes, that's what I had
on my mind.
Who's going to
make up for the garden?
Silence!
Who bribed the lawyer?
Who paid the notary to ignore
the register?
Just tell me that if you are
so clever! Just tell me that!
And when I came to see you
and said: Commander,
wouldn't there be a job for me
on that Babylon tower of yours
now called "a monument",
what did you tell me?
What... what...
did you... tell me?
Just answer me!
What did you tell me then!
You showed me the door,
threw me out like a dog,
that's what you've done,
just like a dog!
That's enough! Quiet!
Listen, you...
in the name of your carpenter
Patron Saint, damn him -
do you realize where I could
have been today if you, too,
had joined the Fascist Guard?
Listen, you!
Because of you they are
calling me an alibist. You...
you... you Ali Baba!
To hell with that garden
of yours, do you understand?
To hell with your farm!
Today things are different!
You martyred carpenter!
I'll show you the kind
of brother-in-law you've got!
Look! Take it! You'll soon know
who I am! Here, you coward!
Take it and read it aloud!
Aloud, so that everyone
can hear you!... Read it!
Court-Order: According to # 1
ordinance No. 31, 40
the Jewish business, namely
the textile shop of the widow
H. Lautmann, Hlinka Square 69,
is taken over
for temporary administration.
The administrator
of this business until further
notice is Antony Brtko.
What do you say now?
You'll take over Lautmann's
Jewish shop - for good!
Na straz.
Na straz! Yesterday, poor,
tomorrow, rich!
You can throw your
carpenter's tools out the window.
I knew it... I swear I did.
Rosie, Rosie, my dear,
I knew it.
You see now?
Tony! My dear brother-in-law...
my dear.
I have a good looking girl...
she keeps a market-stall
selling potatoes on mainstreet
No, no, not potatoes!
We'll sell better products.
Why are you looking so sad?
We'll drink up and that's that!
Give me a kiss, sweetie!
I have a good looking girl...
Wait, Tony! Here,
have one of these!
Take one! Do you like the case?
Take it! Take it!
I'm not in the habit
to owe anything, understand?
Let me see! Look, this is the way...
it opens.
Leave him alone! He'll learn
to be a proper gentleman!
Take it, Tony, it's yours!
Do you have anymore salad?
For you? Always, Mark!
Tony, don't you lose it!
You'll see - I'll make
a classy gentleman of him yet!
Let me tell you, my boy,
if one pulled to the left
and the other to the right,
things would be in a mess.
That's a fact!
Well, as I've been telling you:
have you ever seen a cock
that didn't crow at dawn?
That goes for us too, my friend!
Let's get going
while the going's good.
Cocka doodle doo!
You dope, are you drunk? Now
you've woken up the whole yard!
Now remember what I tell you...
we are one family, understand?
And if we don't get rich now, as
God and the Fuhrer want us to,
we'll never do it! That's serving
our country! Remember that!
I don't believe it... it shines!
It actually shines!
It shines.
It's a flash-light,
so why shouldn't it shine?
It has to shine, a
flash-light...
A flash-light.
That's nice, hum?
Three!
Five!
You won't last.
Five! Five!
We'll see who lasts longer.
Tony, Tony, don't be mad!
Six!
Seven!
No, this is the sixth!
No, this is the sixth.
Leave me alone, will you?
I counted them... six... seven!
And eight!
Eight! Here you are!
Don't, don't drink!
Eight... nine!
Let him be... Wait!
The last one! Now the last one.
And...
Ten! This is the tenth!
Bravo!
He's a real man!
I swear, I'd have never
believed you can do it!
A czardas!
I am just as good as you are.
I am just as good as you,
good as you... 2my girl.
Come on, Tony, dance!
Climb on the stool.
You'll fall off!
I want to speak!
Oh, be quiet!
Quiet, Quiet!
The Fuhrer is speaking:
Excellent! Go on, Tony!
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!
He's sick.
Didn't I tell everyone he's
a coward and not a man?
Just watch him! He'll be sick
all over the kitchen!
Tony! Tony!
He can't take it.
Sieg Heil! Sieg Heil!
Let's go home.
Get up, Tony, get up!
Get up, my dear...
it's late already.
I saw a white butterfly
in my dream.
A white butterfly.
A white butterfly... a white flag...
love thy neighbor.
Here is a clean handkerchief,
if you need it.
I ironed your Sunday shirt.
Get up, Tony!
It's morning already,
and you should have been
in the shop already!
Look how I polished your shoes!
What a lovely day!
Here's your cigarette-case.
The Court order
concerning the Jewish shop
is in your right-hand pocket.
Don't lose it!
You have to look
clean and tidy!
God grant us a good morning,
neighbors!
Good morning!
The guests stayed late, what?
Yes, very late.
You didn't get much sleep.
Yes.
Go to hell! You, too!
Don't trust anybody, Tony!
You've got to put out a sign:
We don't sell on credit -
if you've no money, don't buy.
Don't forget!
Essenc! Come -
you'll stay at home!
Here I am... a rich man
before I realize it.
Beliansky is a rich man too...
Vincenc!
This doesn't look as high as
I thought it was yesterday.
Good morning!
Good morning!
What is it you need,
young man?
- Safety pins?
- What? No, no.
Well, what?
We've got everything.
This?
As you wish.
No, no... thank you!
You don't have to worry,
young man.
You don't suffer from rheumatism yet...
I can't sleep from pain.
My hands are like ice...
like ants crawling all over them.
The doctor says: gout! No,
I say, doctor, that isn't gout,
it's my years...
the old age.
Did you know Mr. Sekerak?
Not the ice-cream vendor,
but his brother -
the one who worked in Laborec,
in the forest
the gout twisted his hands...
he is a sick man now.
The poor lady...
who did you say it was?
Not a lady...
Sekerak, the carter...
poor man
ate fish all his life.
I mean on Sundays - week days
they had porridge or potatoes.
On Sabbath, a fish
is the best thing.
I don't know.
It's easy to make: you need
trout, an onion, carrots.
Mrs. Lautmann, I didn't come
for recipes...
I... for heaven's sake,
where did I put it?
Here! Read it!
I was afraid I had lost it.
Please, forgive me... I don't
see well enough to read.
You don't see well enough?
Well.
I have been appointed Aryan
manager of your shop.
Excuse me?
Your shop.
Oh, you want buttons!
We've got them.
We've got cotton buttons,
steel buttons, big ones,
small ones for shirt...
A nice selection.
Listen, Mrs. Lautmann!
I'll try to explain.
You are Jewish, right?
Well, and I am an Aryan.
The Jewish shops are all gone!
That's the law.
Now only Aryans
can keep shops.
That's what they call
"Aryanization". Understand?
I don't.
You don't understand.
Yes, here it is,
all in black and white.
I am your Aryan... and you are my Jewess.
3Do you understand?
You are the rent-collector!
Or are you the bailiff?
No, I am not... I am your Aryan!
Just as I thought...
such a solid man.
Do forgive me, young man.
I don't hear well.
What's your name, young man?
Brtko. Tony Brtko.
Krtko?
No, Mrs. Lautmann... not Krtko -
B... B...
Krtko... an interesting name...
I know... I know.
My Heinrich.
My beloved dead husband,
used to say: Rosalie, Rosalie.
I'd rather you starved but
the taxes have to be paid!
The old bills are
in the pantry.
A shop-keeper must think of
his honor first, right?
Well, am I right, Mr. Krtko...
am I right?
This is what I brought
from the Waldes-factory.
Here! And this is... wait...
am I right?
Am I right?
Yes... you are right...
you are right.
Good day!
Oh, Imre! Imre!
Brtko! What are you doing
here? Buying buttons for Evelyn?
Imre - I've been waiting for you
since morning.
Don't be angry...
I've brought you a fish for Sabbath.
A fish you've never
had before!
You'll have enough
to invite even Brtko.
Mr. Brtko has been waiting
quite long already.
I thought he was a bailiff
from the court in Brno.
Brtke the bailiff?
You are all dressed up, that's
why the poor old soul thought...
Well... I'll come another time.
- Wait, Tony, wait!
- Yes.
Don't worry... there's nothing
to worry about.
Everything's all right...
Look, Rosalie, make us a cup of tea.
- Tea?
- Tea!
Tea... yes...
It won't take a minute.
A nice cup of tea...
the way you always do.
We'll join you in a second.
Well...
Well? What?
Well, I say.
I swear to God I didn't do
anything to get it.
You didn't do anything and yet you've
been appointed manager of her shop?
If I didn't take it,
someone else would.
Fool!
Now that's enough! Don't be rude!
I am no fool.
If I tell you
I've got the decree.
Look, Tony, if I hadn't known you
all your life
I'd say you are a gangster!
But you are only an old fool
they've cheated.
- Who?
- Your own brother-in-law!
Why would he cheat me?
Just watch closely!
Watch...
Don't you know that
they've already divided
all the good Jewish shops
among themselves!?
You've been cheated, friend!
Kolkocky threw a bone to you -
a bone sucked dry
and cleaned before!
You think she was living on
the profits from the shop?
She lives on the alms
the Jews collect for her.
Well, look.
See for yourself!
I see it...
I get it now, Mr. Kuchar.
Wait! Tony,
where are you going?
Home, Mr. Kuchar...
I don't give a damn about all this.
Actually, I am quite pleased.
I'll go up to the town-hall
and tell them what they can do
with their decree
trying to cheat decent people.
You are just like
a little boy.
What will you, tell them?
That Kolkocky cheated you
that this is no gold mine but
a broken down, dilapidated hole?
They'll show you the door!
No one is going to make
a fool of me!
Let them try their tricks
on others.
Look Tony, I'd much rather
you took over the shop
than another stupid lout.
We can reach an agreement.
Mrs. Lautmann hasn't died
of starvation yet
and you won't regret it either.
- What am I supposed to do?
- You? Nothing.
We can arrange things
to work both ways.
You never know when
you will need it.
I could have been looking down
from that picture
and old Lautmann could have
been standing here with you.
I still remember the day
in the trenches
bullets whistling past my head.
One of us had to stick
his head out.
Lautmann did - and I am here.
A bullet hit him in the head.
My mother always bought buttons
from Mrs. Lautmann.
Oh, tea! Tea, tea, tea!
Thank you. No one makes such
good tea as you do, Rosalie!
Jasmine tea.
Tony, come and sit down.
Sit down, make yourself at home,
sit down.
Do you know who this gentleman
is, Rosalie? You don't?
That's the one I told you about -
Lilly's cousin
I've told you often enough.
He said he'd come to help you
with the store.
For a month or two...
maybe even longer -
Yes, Lilly's cousin.
Don't you remember?
Is that him?
But Mr. Kuchar, what are you
talking about?
I am the "Arisator",
not some "help".
Don't interfere.
I know what I'm doing!
She doesn't know anything
about the "Arisation".
Maybe she doesn't even know
there's a war.
What did the young man say?
But what are you going to do,
Mr. Kuchar?
He said he will come,
but tomorrow
and as often as you need him.
Sure! May God bless you for
being so good.
I am not as alone
as I often think.
What's the young man's name?
His name is Tony! Tony!
You'll be like my own son,
Tony!
Oh, oh! I forgot to get
the vinegar for your fish!
See, Tony? Everything
can be arranged.
Tony, have you ever heard
the German saying
"To live and let live?" " To feed
the wolf and keep the sheep?"
Andrew took over Weinstein's
saw-mill who still works there.
I am going to see him now
and tell him:
Mr. Weinstein, that's why
you've got to raise your taxes
to save the widow Lautmann.
And what if he doesn't pay?
If Weinstein won't,
I'll go to Hartmann, see?
They still have money. Or I'll
go and see Lowy, Roth.
- Do you know Katz?
- The barber?
Yes.
Yes... well... it's nothing...
- What have I been saying?
- About the barber.
Yes... look Katz the barber
is the cashier.
You'll get your "wages"
from him every week.
Wages?
Don't you understand?
You are the Aryan administrator
of Mrs. Lautmann's shop,
aren't you?
Thus, you become an employee
of the Jewish Community!
Do you understand?
With a regular monthly wage.
You don't say.
Don't I? You'll do that.
You'll get it, let's see
six or seven hundred Crowns
a month.
You never make that much
in your own trade.
Yes, Mr. Kuchar...
Did you know Cutka,
the one that stuck
his hand
into the circular saw?
It's a hard job...
taking over a Jewish shop.
Tell me...
what did she say?
The old lady was surprised,
then said she doesn't care
whether the shop is managed
by Tom, Dick or Harry.
So she doesn't care whether
it's me or someone else.
And I said: "You have nothing
to worry about, Mrs. Lautmann".
"I am not going to eat you".
And she said: "I've been
dreaming of you.
"You are a nice Arisator".
She'd been dreaming of me.
The old woman! She can
help me in the beginning,
work as my assistant.
Don't let her cheat you!
Why would she? I told her,
I said: "Mrs. Lautmann, watch it!
"I won't stand for any...
trick or such".
And the keys?
Did she give you the keys?
- The keys?
- Yes.
- I will get them tomorrow.
- What?
She'll give me the keys tomorrow!
She won't eat them!
You left her the keys?
I have to go slow...
I'd scare her... she is rather old.
Is she? Wait, Tony!...
Look what I've bought for you!
What is it?
In this you'll make notes
of everything in the shop,
what's lying,
what's standing,
and remember, she doesn't
keep her wealth in the shop,
but hidden under the floor.
- Good day!
- Good day!
- Excuse me!
- That's all right.
Good day! I'll be with you
in a minute... Good day!
Good day.
Mrs. Lautmann!
Mrs. Lautmann!
You have to knock harder -
she is quite deaf!
She needs her ears cleaned.
- Good day, Mrs. Andric.
- Good day!
Mrs. Lautmann!
Oh, it's Krtko?
What are you doing here?
My name is Brtko! Tony!
Don't mind me... come in,
nice of you to have come!
Mrs. Lautmann...
we have to open the shop!
I am sorry I haven't tidied up.
I didn't know you were coming.
Did you have breakfast?
I overslept.
I said to myself: "it's Sabbath today,
there's plenty of time".
Mrs. Lautmann,
people are wondering why
we haven't opened the shop yet.
It's almost eight...
bim... bim... eight! It's late!
Do tell me -
did you have breakfast?
I did... I did.
Do sit down!
Mrs. Lautmann...
we can't go on this way.
We have to open up!
The key! The lock!
The shutters!
We want to sell buttons,
don't we?
No, my boy - it's Sabbath
today. I never open on Sabbath.
Never sell buttons.
Sabbath or not -
business is business!
No, no... do sit down, do!
No, I won't! Listen, you!
Where are you going!
That isn't the right door!
The toilet is in the yard!
Do you have the key?
Tony! Tony! Krtko!
I'll be right back!
Have you seen Mr. Kuchar?
He's next door!
Mr. Kuchar! Mr. Kuchar!
What is it, Tony?
The old lady is being difficult.
No one told me about Sabbath.
What?
She refuses to open the shop.
She says it's Sabbath.
Oh, Sabbath! Sabbath!
Sit down, Tony, sit down.
Sabbath... sa...
I'll fix this.
Well... Aladar!
God bless...
CLOSED FOR INVENTORY
That is my Rosie... and Clara.
Yes... they are in America.
About three years
after the war -
my brother Josl came
on a visit.
They call him Joe now...
he is a rich man, very rich.
He has a factory -
makes soda-water.
So he said to me: "Heinrich
did not come back from the war.
"You'll have a hard time".
Rosie was 16 at the time...
and Clara... Look!
Very nice.
Yes, Mrs. Lautmann,
but this chair is badly
in need of a carpenter.
I think everything
is broken here.
My Rosie is gone...
My Clara is gone.
My Heinrich is dead.
Joe doesn't write...
This is nice furniture...
decent stuff
but no longer fashionable.
It needs smoothing down,
new polish, paint, glazing.
It could be as good as new!
Why am I keeping these suits,
I ask you? What's the use?
Do you know what I'll do,
Mrs. Lautmann?
I'll bring my tools on Monday
and start working!
We'll have things
ship-shape soon.
The bed will look like new.
I promise, dear Mrs. Lautmann!
Look, a dog -
that's all I needed!
Essenc!
What are you doing here?
Throw him out!
Don't worry...
it's my dog.
Don't be afraid, Mrs. Lautmann...
he doesn't bite.
I see! Is he yours?
I opened the gate and
he slipped between my legs!
Slipped straight in.
Mrs. Lautmann, come here.
I'll tell you something!
Don't be afraid -
he'll even shake, if you'd like.
They are selling white beans.
I am going to the market on
Monday, I could get some for you.
I've got the shopping list ready.
Is that all?
I'll come in later
to make a fire.
It can't be helped -
you have to go!
And you stay there!
You are not to come in!
I've sent him away,
as you are afraid of him.
She helps me on Sabbath-days.
A very nice lady -
a good soul.
Look... Henrich didn't have
a chance to wear it out.
The best English cloth...
Take it! Try it on!
Jesus - Mrs. Lautmann!
Wear it, wear it -
what am I going to do with it?
I think it will be a good fit.
Mr. Lautmann must have had
the same figure as I.
Am I right, Mrs. Lautmann?
A hat marked "Huckel" -
elegant and practical
for Sundays or any other day.
Look how well it suits you!
As if Fischmann the tailor
had sewn that suit for you!
Here - take it!
And look at yourself
in the mirror! Look! Well?
I look like Charlie Chaplin.
Good day!
Who's that?
Good day!
- I kiss your hand, ladies!
- Hello, Marian!
Meet my sister -
introduce yourself.
- My brother-in-law.
- Pleased to meet you.
- Marian, weren't you a tailor?
- I was.
You can help us choose.
Mark, we'll catch up with you
in a minute! Let's go.
- Don't stand there gossiping.
- And don't you go to the pub!
Good day!
My most sincere greetings,
gentlemen!
God bless you, Mr. Andric!
Listen, you... come here!
Come here.
Can you tell us where you
got that hat?
That hat... wasn't given to me.
I bought it from Kuchar -
the poor man has to sell
his things.
He's broke. It cost nothing.
Nice hat, isn't it?
I'll have him arrested!
I'm going to clean this town
of all Jew-lovers!
Jew-lovers?!
Yes, he is a dirty Jew-lover,
your Mr. Kuchar.
I know all about him!
We're keeping an eye on him!
I'll give you an advice.
Don't be too close with him!
A Jew-lover is worse
than a regular Jew,
since he isn't a Jew himself
but helps Jews.
That's interesting.
Interesting? You bloody fool!
It's downright dangerous!
What's that there?
Listen to me, my friend -
that Jewish sign must disappear
from our main street,
understand?
Citizens, hear this public
announcement:
All owners of dogs, whether
Alsatians, German shepherds,
St. Bernards or any other breed
must pay a dog-tax
within ten days.
Those who disobey this order
will be punished!
Their dogs will be put away
without further notice.
- How much?
-30 Tallers a piece.
That's much too expensive.
Things are getting dearer
every day.
Well, how much?
Wait a minute,
I am in a hurry.
I was first.
And the princess said
to the shepherd
"Don't go back to your sheep.
Come with me to the castle".
Uncle, what is glue made of?
Of horses' hooves.
Of horses' hooves?
As I told you.
Uncle... and what's that
you are putting on now?
Shellack, my boy.
Is it? And what is shellack
made of, uncle?
From bird droppings.
Erika!
What is it?
Where's mother?
In town.
Hello, Danko!
I see you are busy?
I am. Well, are you back
from work or going to work?
Is that old stuff worth
the trouble?
I like to put things together.
Selling buttons
isn't a man's job.
Tony!
Has someone been calling me?
I have to.
- Uncle, your cigarette.
- You finish it.
What do you need it for?
- For a swathing-band.
- A swathing-band?
We sell everything.
We've got everything, ladies.
Seven, eight, nine, ten...
twelve. Exactly twelve.
How much does this cost?
How much... wait a minute...
how much is it?
10 Hellers.
10 Hellers, that is
one crown and twenty.
- Give me eight.
- Yes? Six... eight.
- What about these buttons?
- Of course.
We have so many. We could
pave the town with them!
You can put them
on the whole family's clothing.
Do we have such buttons?
- What?
- Do we?
- We do... we do.
- We do!
But where do we have them?
Well, where?
Where? Right here!
Go away.
Do you have
cross-stitch patterns?
With proverbs? Of course!
We have some.
I'll get them...
I'll get them right away.
Do we have
cross-stitch patterns?
Of course, we do...
Do we have
cross-stitch patterns?
Do we have any?
Cross-stitch patterns?
- Where?
- Up there.
I'll get them
for you right away.
You can do your cross-stitch
till your fingers hurt!
Whoever trusts in God
need not fear evil!
We have that saying too.
Tony, Tony...
not there... here!
Do you have
them or don't you?
Tony! Tony!
Down there!
Come later, Evelyn!
You see how busy I am!
Don't bother...
it's nothing.
You slow poke,
at the bottom.
Mrs. Lautmann...
what kind of work is this?
Don't stand there like Lot's
wife! Serve the customers!
Come later, Evelyn!
