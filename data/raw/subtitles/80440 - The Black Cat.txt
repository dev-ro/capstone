Water down there.

Yeah, I'll see your ass
in the fucking showers.
You know the goddamn rules.
Okay. Come on. Let's move on.
Hey. They should know the
goddamn rules by now.
That's all I'm sayin'. One ladle per person.
Just calm down.
They should know the
goddamn rules by now.
I'm calm.
Okay.
I'm calm. I'm calm.
Hey, what's happenin'?
You want this shovel up your ass?
Get the fuck out of my face.
Are you here to work,
Wheeler, or exercise your jaw?
Hey, boss, I was just tellin' Hobbs
I ain't thirsty, that's all.
I don't give a shit if you was
sayin' up a Hosanna for his soul.
A Ho-sanna?
Now what the fuck is a Hosanna?
I's like a quick attitude
check if I was you, boy.
It's your world, boss.
I'm just diggin' through, ya know?
Hey, Hobbs, gimme that swallow.
It's now or never.
Keep you eyes on the fucking pail. Go.
Give a hand ... you, too!
Luther. Do it now.
Ow, man, my foot!
I need some help! What's going on?
Oh, you got a man hurt. I'm bleedin', man!
Chief!
My foot, oh, man. Man down!
I can't believe I did this.
Ya'all get back to work.
I need some help, man.
Help, aw, there's blood, man.
Hey, he's hurt bad.
God! Hey, come on, man,
I'm losin' blood, okay?
Now what did this dumbshit do to himself?
Damn!
Let's go, let's go!
You shoot at me,
I'll put a bullet in his brain.
Luther, let's go, man.
Come back.
Escape in progress.
Let's go!
Ten Reed, get the car.
Stay...
Go ahead, shoot me!
No, don't!
Shoot this motherfucker, Gunson.
Does anybody read me?
You're dead meat you son-of-a-b-...
Does anybody read me?
Out!
Uh, all right.
Get out. Down!
Don't, don't shoot.
Down.
What I'm gonna do to you. Huh?
You know what I'm gonna do to you?
Wheeler!
Adrian. Hold on.
I'm gonna say a Hosanna
for you, okay, baby?
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's get outta here! Drive man, drive!
We're ...
...free, man!
Fuck, yeah.
We're free, man. We did it!
He's hit.
My god, he's hit! Pull over.
Shit.
Sheriff.
Bill.
Sorry to keep you waitin'. Call of nature.
Had to get rid of a six pack, did you?
Well, you know what they say.
You can't own beer.
You can only rent it.
Is your boy racing today?
Yeah, he's over to uh, Pilot County.
That's the biggest race so far this year.
They got drivers comin' in
all the way from Houston.
Yeah?
Mm-hm. Wasted trip if you ask me.
Johnny Del's gonna kick their asses.
That boys bringin' me home another
trophy, mark my words.
Well, you need another trophy
in that window...
...like that mangy old hound
of yours needs another flea.
Another trophy, you mark my words.
Yes sir.
But he won't be bringin'
home that many more anyway.
How's that?
He's been savin' up his winnings for what,
four years now and goin' away to college.
Gonna make somethin' of himself.
What exactly?
Well, he's not gonna pump gas
the rest of his days, tell you what.
Well, that'll be uh, eight dollars even.
Say hello to that boy of yours for me.
It's only a race.
Sara Jane, if you say it's only
a race one more time,
I think I'm gonna bust.
Damn half lap left to go when the
head gasket blows out on me.
My old man's gonna gloat for a month.
It's only a race.
Looks like old Norm thinks
they're still in the race.
Shit!
Hey, Grissom, get that sorry
piece of shit off my highway...
...before someone gets hurt!
Howdy, Sam.
Yo, Johnny ...
...good race today.
Good race?
Bullshit! It was a great race!
Yeah!
Ain't this the most beautiful
thing you ever saw?
Looks like skill and talent
finally won out over blind,
stupid-ass luck, huh, Grissom?
Blind luck?
Hey!
Huck him.
I know a fellah who'd give you fifty bucks
if you wanna scrap that
big old black bag of Bandini.
I'll just keep that in mind, Norm.
You do that.
Well, let's go, Sam!
That's our local law enforcement right there.
Makes you sleep easy at night, don't it?
Oh, my god! Blind luck?
Norm, you asshole!
It's only blind luck you won! Kiss my ass!
Hey.
Sara Jane, set-tle down.
Man! It's only a race.
Well, thanks for coming out today.
Even though I ate dirt.
Can I see ya later?
Um, I don't know.
You know how my dad gets about all that.
Well, I'll tell ya what.
I'll swing on by here tonight
just in case you get out.
Okay.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
I don't see no trophy.
That's 'cause I ain't got one.
A blown head gasket saw to that.
Count my blessings.
I don't need another damn trophy
jammin' up the window, col-lectin' dust.
I don't know why you waste your time.
It's called tuition.
College is good for makin'
doctors and lawyers, boy.
And you ain't got the
brains for neither.
Come on, Homer, let's get
you some supper.
God damn, that head gasket anyways.
Oh. Howdy, Sara Jane.
Norm.
You look mighty pretty today.
What are you doing here?
Ah, I was just about to go on duty.
I thought I'd stop by and have
me a few words with the sheriff.
About what?
Ahh, things. This and that.
Hey, by the way, what'd you
think of that race today, huh?
Wasn't that somethin'?
What race is that, Norm?
The race old Normy won.
The race that Johnny
Del Grissom took you to.
And lost.
I think you must be
mistaken about that, Norm.
Sara, do you think I'm stupid?
I saw you in the damn truck.
I mean, what is it on that Johnny
Del Grissom has that I don't have?
Me.
Well, nice to see ya today,
Sara Jane.
You have a nice day.
Sara Jane, I understand you've been
seen with that Grissom boy again.
Suppose I don't have to guess
very hard who you heard that from.
Watch your mouth, young lady.
Norm Babbitt also tell you that he
and Sam Arno...
...were seen travellin' down
a public highway, drinkin' beer and
doin' better than ninety miles an hour?
Well, if that's the case,
I suppose I need to have a
little talk with my deputies.
But That's off the subject.
I told you I didn't want
ya near that Grissom kid.
He and his old man are nothin'
but poor white trash.
You got no business bein'
around their kind.
You don't know Johnny. He...
Now, goddamnit!
Don't you tell me what I know.
I've been around a little bit longer
than you have, little lady.
I might just know a few more things
than you give me credit for.
And I'm layin' down the law on this one.
Yeah, you lay down the law, big law man.
Don't make me get up from
this table. I'll...
Sara Jane.
Sit down!
Let her go.
How's that head gasket?
It's near done.
Few things to tend to yet,
but nothin' that won't wait till mornin'.
Plenty of stew, you want some.
Ummm, no, thanks.
I'm gonna get a bite to eat in town.
Besides, I've had your stew before.
Suit yourself.
Well, have a good night.
Howdy, Sam.
Johnny
Norm. Some kind of problem?.
Well, it seems to old Normy
like you might've been exceeding...
the speed limit a little
bit there, Johnny boy.
Well, I'm afraid you're mistaken.
I was right on the number.
Nah, no mistake.
I clocked ya doin' eighty.
Ain't that right, Sam?
If you say so.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to issue
you a citation for speedin', Johnny.
Oh, come on, Sam,
what's goin' on here?
Well, looks to me like you
weren't only speedin'...
...but you've got a busted
headlight here.
That's an infraction of the Vehicle Code.
You got somethin' to say to
me, Norm? Don't be shy.
Now that you mention it,
I do recall the sheriff askin' me
to let you know...
...how much he'd appreciate you
stayin' clear of his daughter.
I think you'd be hard-pressed
to find someone...
...who gives less of a shit
about how the sheriff feels.
Let me see if I can't make this a
little cleare for you, Johnny boy.
Hey!
Break it up, now!
Goddamnit, break it up, I said!
You're pushin' me, Norm.
Damn it, that's enough.
Are you crazy?
The sheriff told you to have a
word with him, not beat him bloody.
Yeah, well he's lucky I don't rip off his
head and shit down his goddamn neck!
Why don't you take off that
badge and try it, blondie?
He's right.
You got a personal gripe,
you take off that uniform.
And as for you, you get in
your truck and drive away.
Now.
Oh, okay. I thought you were
gonna issue me a citation, officer.
Don't press your luck,
Johnny Del. Go home.
Hey, Norm. Taillight's busted.
That son-of-a-bitch. Did you see that?
I didn't see shit.
Thought you might be hungry.
Your father thinks only of
what's best for you.
That's why he gets like that.
They're not really our kind of people.
You don't know, Johnny.
No, that's right, I don't.
But I do know that Johnny Del didn't
even lay eyes on his daddy
till he was nine years old.
And that was the day they
let his daddy outta prison.
I know that.
And his mama, stayed just long
enough to pack her bags.
Can you imagine that?
Your daddy loves you, child.
Don't you ever forget that.
What are you doin' here?
Uh, I wanted to see you.
What the hell happened to you?
It's a little gift from Norm Babbitt.
A token of his admir-ation.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I waited for you at the A & W tonight.
Yeah, well...
I couldn't get away.
Did you wait very long?
No, not very long.
Yes, you did. Heh.
I'm glad you're here.
Glad I'm here, too.
Hmp, uh-uh, don't turn the page.
Okay.
Then this part connects right over here.
Now, you know why it's
called the suspension bridge?
Because the roadway is suspended from
the tower by the cable.
That's why.
School girl is so smart.
No.
Get off!
That's the Golden Gate right there.
I'm gonna build me a bridge
like that some day.
Why?
Why?
So, I bet if you stood on top
of them towers,
you could see the whole damn world.
Oh, my god, it's late. I have got to get home.
When's this gonna stop?
What?
All this sneakin' around.
Hopin' all the wrong people don't see.
Turn around.
We've gotta get outta this
town, Sara Jane.
I want to get so far away from this
place that it ain't even a memory anymore.
Heh. You talk so crazy sometimes.
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?
I love you.
Sara Jane.
How dare you?
Good morning to all of
you in southern Texas.
We're goin' into another scorcher today.
Temperatures are goin' up
into the three digit mark.
Howdy, Mister Bartlett.
Johnny.
Whatcha after, a fill-up?
Suite me fine.
Fill-up it is.
You just stay in the car.
I got somethin' t say to you.
It'd be a good idea if you paid
attention 'cause I'm not gonna repeat myself.
I'm listenin'.
If you ever so much as look in my
daughter's direction again, so help me God.
I'll break your neck with my own hands.
Am I makin' myself pretty damn....
...clear?
Daddy.
Get back in the car, Sara Jane.
Stay there.
Now, you've had fair warning.
And that's all the warning you're gonna get.
Some kind of problem here, Sheriff?
Only problem is this boy of yours.
Gonna wind up in the hospital
if he doesn't watch his step.
What's the matter?
Isn't he good enough for your little girl?
Dad.
Wha-, what does she do?
She piss champagne, crap caviar, huh?
What does she do?
I've said all I'm gonna say on this matter.
In that case, I'll thank you kindly
to get the hell off my place.
Stay off!
Sheriff. Can I talk to you
for just one minute, sir?
Get in the car, Sara Jane.
Sheriff.
Get in the goddamn car.
All right!
Sheriff, I just want one minute
of your time, please.
You gonna talk to me for just one minute?
I don't wanna hear it.
Now, listen!
Don't start with me!
You heard what the man said.
He said it plain.
You listen to him.
You take it to heart,
'cause that man could tear
you a new asshole, son.
You're playin' with fire, boy.
You're just playin' with fire.
Now go on, you get on back
to pumpin' some gas.
Mister Bartlett ain't got all day, huh?
That's bullshit.
What? Wha-,wha-,what'd you just say?
I said that's bullshit.
I'm gonna talk to him right away.
Bullshit!
Stay the hell away from that pickup.
Boy, you listenin' to me?
Johnny, you come back here!
I swear, sometimes that boy
is dumber than a barrel of hair.
Ya know,
I, I hope you're real,
real proud of yourself, Daddy.
You bet I am.
Good and proud, little lady.
Good and proud. The way you should be.
No, you're not welcome here no more.
None of you boys.
What the hell you talkin' about, Grissom?
I need some gas.
Well, get it elsewhere.
Elsewhere?
Where, th- ,there ain't
no elsewhere.
We're in the middle of nowhere.
What do you expect me to do?
I don't give a fuck what you do.
No gas!
Yeah, but really...
You ask your boss why not.
You're serious. All right then.
What the hell got up his ass?
The sheriff was here not more than
a minute ago with his daughter.
He had some ugly words with
Johnny Del. Johnny...
...jumped in the tow truck
and took out after him.
The boy was fit to spit nails.
Oh, now this I gotta see.
Hey, thanks, Bartlett. We'll see ya later.
What are you doin'?
Those plates expired last month.
You stay in the car.
Could I see your license
and registration, please?
I need to see your license and registration.
I'm sorry, officer,
I couldn't hear what you were sayin'.
Get the girl.
I'll get her, I'll get her.
I'll get her!
Oh, shit.
Open the door, baby.
Shit!
Come on.
No!
Come on!
Daddy!
Shoot...
Shoot her! Shoot the little bitch!
Oh, Daddy!
Don't shoot her.
She could slow us down.
We need fucking hostage.
Don't you think they're
gonna know we've been here?
Come on.
Noooooooo!
Come on.
You killed him, you son-of-a-bitch!
Shut up!
On my word, you live or die, baby, okay?
So, don't piss me off.
Daddy! Let me go. Daddy!
Sh-ut her up!
Hey.
Open the fuckin' door.
Head!
Just open the goddamn door!
We got company, boys.
Johnny
Holy shit.
Let her go.
A crow bar to a gun fight?
Drop the fucking crowbar.
Don't you move.
Just let her go.
Drop the fucking crowbar!
All right!
You got a name, kid?
Johnny Del Grissom.
Well, Johnny Del Grissom,
I do apologize,
but so long, motherfucker.
Son-of-a-bitch!
No! oh, God.
We got him! We did.
We got him.
Just get in the car, woman!
Come on!

Come on back.
Sam. God damn it.
Can you read me? Can you read me?
Sam. Come on back.
Ugh. Yo, Norm. Your food's gonna congeal.
What's the hold up?
The sheriff's dead.
Say, say, again, say what?
I'm out here on the highway east of town.
The sheriff's dead! He's been shot!
Ah, shit, Sam, you gotta get out here.
And uh, Johnny Del Grissom's
pickup truck's out here.
Look like the sheriff took
it with a shotgun.
He's in the middle of the street!
Get out here, goddamnit!
I'm on, I'm , I'm on my way.
Teddy, you been hearin' this?
Uh, affirmative, Sam. Holy Jesus.
Call the State Police and
get your ass out here.
Tell 'em we got a crisis.
Tell 'em, tell 'em the sheriff's dead.
Oh, Ben, don't you worry.
I'm gonna get that Grrissom kid.
I'm gonna get that...
Norm! They took her!
Goddamn you Johnny Del Grison!
Norm!
Jesus!
Come on, Grissom. Show yourself.
Show your face, boy. Come on.
Keys? The keys.
Come on, Norm, what'd ya do
with the fuckin' keys? Holy shit.
Ah, fuck me, man.
God. Goddamn, Man!
I'm fucked up.
Uh, I'm fucked up...
Ten, just stitch it. Ugh.
Shut up!
Can anyone please make
them shut the fuck up?
He's driving me fucking crazy!
This here's Deputy Ernest Briggs,
the Humboldt County Sheriff's Department.
Any deputies from Haddonton copy?
Ernie, this is Sam Arno, come on.
Yeah, Sam, Pete and I heard
some of your cross-chatter.
We're headin' up in your direction
in case you need some extra help.
Door's wide open, friend.
Miss Polson, there's been a
terrible accident up the road.
Could you drive me to my
father's gas station...
...so I could use the telephone?
Why of course, child. Get in.
Thank you.
Norm! You okay?
Ugh. Damn, I already had him.
Teddy, check on the sheriff.
Is he dead?
Oh, he's dead all right.
Ogh. I had him, Sam. Goddamnit.
Had who?
Johnny Del grissom,
the guy that did this.
I had him.
You lay down some flares...
... and wait for the paramedics.
All right.
Thanks, Miss Polson.
Suspect is Johnny Del Grissom.
Repeating...
Suspect is John Del Grissom,
white male early twenties...
Shit.
What the hell are you doin'?
Like father, like son.
That's what your mama used to say.
That's why she let you behind
when she took off.
She said, Bill,...
how could anything that comes outta
you be other than pure shit?
Well, I guess you proved
her right, didn't you, boy?
I did not.
Well, there's a lot of people
disagreeing with ya.
I'm openin' that goddamn door.
I'll shoot you.
I'll shoot you right here.
I'll cut ya down.
You can't run away from
this, son.
It doesn't do any good.
You've gotta listen to me.
The men that did this took Sara Jane...
and they're out on the road right now.
I'm the only hope that she's got.
Did you cut that man down
like they're sayin' or not?
I did not.
Well, either you're tellin'
the truth...
You better make up your mind, old man.
One way or the other.
If you're lyin' to me,
they're gonna have to pry me
off your ass with a crowbar.
Grissom!
Grissom, goddamnit!
Where is he?
Where are you hidin' him?
I seems to remember telling you,
you ain't welcome here no more.
Now, are you uh, ya hard of hearin'
or are you just plain fuckin' stupid.
See anything in there?
Man oughta clean these damn windows.
We could check around back.
Go on, check around back.
So what the man says.
Get on back there. See what's what.
Bill, let's not...
...make this any harder than it has to be.
Johnny Del's way in over his head this time.
The sheriff's lyin' dead
out there on the highway.
Courtesy of your boy.
Yeah, what do you got
to say to that, Mister Grissom?
Well, that's a bunch of bullshit.
Inside!
Oh, shit !
Sam, let's go!
Move it! Move it!
Let's go!
This is the State Police calling all
available Haddonton County sheriff's units.
Please advise with your twenty.
We are in pursuit of a suspect
in a black four-forty-two
heading west about a mile out
of Haddonton on Highway Seventeen.
What is your location?
We're coming up on town
from the south.
Be advised we have additional
state units approaching Haddonton.
All right, then why don't ya

Suspect driving a four-four-two.
We're looking for a black four-four-two.

Damnit!
Oh, goddamnit!
Come on, Lucy. Come on, Lucy.
Come on, baby.
Come on, Lucy. We can do it.
Norm?
Norm, you wanna calm the fuck down?
You want me to calm the fuck down?
Sam, maybe you don't realize it,
but I could've just been killed.
Now, why don't you help me out
and let's get this car unstuck
so we can catch our criminal.
You got me?
Sure, buddy.
Sure.
Goddamnit, Sam, push like a man!
Come on!

We just blew him doin' a hundred.
This is Deputy Arno to all pursuing units.
Come on.
Come on.
What the hell's wrong with this thing?
Uh, it's been actin' up a couple weeks.
Give her a little kick.
Damn. Too hard?
Ho-ho, just think about it.
No trophy this time, No-rm.
He's pulling away, goddamnit!
Mother of mercy,
what's he burnin' in that thing?
Wake up. Wake up, man.
We're in New Mexico.
Hey, man, Luther, wake up.
Hey, man, we're in New Mexico.
Leave him alone, he's hurt!
You on your period or somethin'?
Fuckin' bitch.
Jesus.
Ah, Jesus, I fuckin' hurt, man.
I'm fuckin' burnin' up.
Ogh, Jesus, man. I need a doctor.
We're goin' to a doctor, right?
Doctor gonna take care of me, man.
No doctors, Luther, you know that.
They gonna let me die.
Please tell them they
gotta take me to a doctor.
Please, I'm begging you.
Please tell them they
gotta take me to a doctor.
No doctors till we get to Mexico.
We can't slow down.
I'm sorry, bro'.
You just, you just gonna let,
Iet the brother die in the back seat, man?
You just gonna let me die
so I don't have to slow you down?
You ain't shit, Wheeler!

You ain't lettin' me die, motherfucker!
Hey.

Hey.
You'll die!
Put the fuckin' refle down, Lu-ther!
Fuck you, Man!
Motherfucker.
Hey! Stop it! Hey, man.
Get your foot off the gas!
Fuck off! Give me the fucking wheel.
Oh, shit!
Well, you had to do it, man.
Shut up!
It's the best thing
you could've done for him.
Gimme osmethin' to clean
the asshole's blood off of me.
He was fuckin' practically
dead anyway.
I said shut up!
Okay.
Shit, man. I can't even see him no more.
Yeah, I bet you a case of
beer and a hand grenade
he's headed straight for that state line.
You're not thinkin' about goin'
into New Mexico after him?
Come on now, partner,
you know we can't to do that.
The arrest would be illegal.
Doh, ain't you caught on yet?
There ain't gonna be no arrest.
You oughta think about what
you're sayin', son.
Think about it real good.
And get your head out your ass.
Jesus. Hey, man.
You're one of them. Hey.
Wheeler.
Wheeler.
He's a devil, man. On holiday from hell.
Where are they taking the girl?
I saw him kill that sheriff.
Blew him straight across the highway.
Okay, where are they

Come on, stay with me.
Delano.
Delano. What is that?
Is that a town?
Come on, man, what's Delano?

Can you hear me? Hey!
You're not dead?
You're not dead.
Come on, man, stay with me!
Egh. Shit!
Stop! Stop the car.
Don't tell me to stop, goddamnit!
Oh, my god. My god.
Oh, hell!
He's getting' away, damnit!
There's a dead body lying here
in the middle of the road,
for God's sake.
We just can't leave him here.
Damnit. All right,
Iet's get him in the trunk.
Where's it at, huh?
What'd ya do with it?
What?
Your mind!
Evidently you lost that
son-of-a-bitch somewhere!
We're officers of the law.
We can't just pass across New Mexico with a
body bangin' around in the damn car trunk!
All right, fine.
Fuck you and fuck him.
You stay here with him.
I've got a criminal to catch.
Norm, don't you drive away from me.
There's a criminal getting away!
Norm, don't you do it!
I'm in a hot pursuit, Sam.
Asshole.
No.
No, it's not empty! Damn! Damn!
Be a good girl.
Fill'er up?
This guy had plenty of credit cards.
And we're okay 'cause we're
on C-fifteen.
And that's the cutoff we needed.
Question, D.J.
Shouldn't we get our asses into Mexico?
I mean...
...why do we have to stop in Delano?
Because I got unfinished business in Delano.
So mind your own fucking business.
We'll go to Mexico when I say so.
Can we get out of the car?
No. Why?
Why do you wanna get out of the car?
I have to pee.
All right, you be a good girl now.
You go and you take a piss
and you get right back in the car.
Go on.
Nice car.
I'm not, I'm not done yet.
Well, open the fucking door,
or I'm gonna break it down.
Come on!
What are you doin'?
You weren't writing something
on the wall, were you?
Like a message to somebody?
Maybe in the stalls or somethin'?
No?
I guess not.
You're a smart girl, aren't you?
I know.
Okay, let's go, smart girl.
Come on.
See it right there.
Sign the line with your signature.
Hey, kid. You got a,
toilet's all backed up.
Your men's room's getting' all flooded.
Fuck.
Come on.
Go ahead and run, Johnny Del!
Run, Boy!
I'm stickin' to your ass
like Fruit of the Loom!
Come on, baby.
Oh, come on. Come on,
Lucy, what is it? What's the matter?
Come on.
Never did get any gas.
Thank you, Bill Grissom.
Get back to town and pop
you in the mouth, old man.
Sam. Sam, come on ...
There better be a goddamn
gas can in here.
Hello! Hello!
I'm pumpin' some gas out here!
Shit!
Damnit. Delano.
Hello?
Hey, you got a customer out here!
Hey, you got a customer out here!
I need gas,
I've been walkin' five miles!
Ah, shit, uh, shit! Oh.
Water, water, water.
Ooh-hoo, dead body.
Okay, I can't deal with this right now.
Agh. Oh, Grissom! Agh!
He's out of control.
Sara.
Smart girl.
Goddamn. Goddamn. All right, okay.
What?
W-were you Daddy's girl?
Are you clean? Huh?
You'd have to be clean for me.
I'm gonna ask you to do a
little favor for me.
I want you to let me put
my finger in your mouth.
Stop it. Stop.
Come here.
Stop it.
Come here, baby.
Get the hell, get the hell off!
Hey! Ain't she a little
bit old for you?Huh, shot eyes?
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?
It means you're over the hill
for him, honey.
Hobbs here,
he likes 'em about nine years old.
Ain't that right?
Fucking sick pig.
Well, you ain't my idea of a
dream date either, you little bitch!
Now, you open your fucking mouth
Get off of me!
or I'm gonna push your
teeth down your fucking throat!
You fucker!
You fucker!
Disgusting!
Get out of the damn car.
Disgusting!
Bitch!
Hell, you!
Get her off me!
Goddamnit! I'm gonna strangle you!
I'm gonna strangle you!
Let me go!
No, please.
You broke my cardinal fuckin' rule.
I'm talkin' to you and we
should be moving, right?
Let go of me!
Don't make that fuckin' mistake again.
Now get in the fucking car!
Let me go! No.
Hobbs, get in the car!
Come on, let's go.
Johnny!
Fuck.
Shit!
Nice try, kid! Call Triple A.
Ohhh. Shit.
Come on, you bastard! Come on!
Johnny, hold on.
Sara!
Give me a gun, I'll kill the fucker.
Shut the fuck up, man.
I don't wanna kill him,
I wanna hurt him a little bit.
Come on, boy.
You never should
have stuck me with that knife.
Johnny! What are you ...
Look at him, look at him run.
Wait! Wait!
Whoao-ho, now.
Sara!
You're never gonna get that thing
out of there, you piece of shit!
Goddamnit!
As a deputy sheriff for
the state of Taxas,
I order you to come take these
handcuffs off of me now,
Grissom.
Goddamnit, stop what you're doin'!
Get up, Norm.
Fuck you.
Norm...
...l am not fuckin' with you.
Get off your ass.
Finish it. Pull the trigger.
What are you waitin' for, huh?
Hey, in the goddamn car.
I ain't playin' your hostage...
Now move your ass.
You touch her, and I'll cut you in
little pieces, I swear to God.
You'll be all right, kid.
I'm sorry.
Hi, baby, how ya doin'?
That's him, right there, with his back to us.
Why don't you go have a
little talk with him, huh?
Pitcher of beer.
You must be Harlan.
You know me? I don't know you.
Mutual friend said
we might do some business.
Business?
Well, I believe your mutual friend
is bullshittin' you, Geronimo.
I'm just Border Patrol.
A nine-to-five man. So fuck off.
Keep your hands on the table.
And smile.
Smile before I blow your
balls all over that pool table.
D.J. Goddamn.
As I live and breathe,
it's good to see you, man.
Let me buy you a beer, Harlan.
Thanks. So when'd they let ya out? Heh.
Well, they didn't exactly let me out.
I just sort of took it upon myself,
ya know what I mean?
Think you oughta be here, man?
I mean, it's a bit dicey, ain't it?
We're gonna cross the border into Mexico.
But I said to my friend here,
we gotta stop by and say
goodbye to good ol' Harlan.
One last time.
Well, I'm glad ya did, man.
Cause it's always good to see you.
Yeah, you said that.
You wanna tell your friend
to get his gun out of my crotch?
Who is it?
It's me.
Goddamnit, man, where you been?
Back off. Don't even try it.
Who are you?
Come on.
Don't go crazy.
Let go.
We gonna cruise this damn town all night?
If that's what it takes.
Damn, Harlan, you and your
friends have some nice toys.
Yeah, real nice.
You got a fuckin' arsenal here, Harlan.
You never had guns
like this when I was around.
All right, I'm exhausted.
I am dirty.
I've been up for fuckin' days.
I'm not in the mood for bullshit,
so just tell me where the shit is
and we'll fucking get outta here, okay?
That ain't bullshit, man.
I swear. I told you the truth.
I'm gonna cut your balls off
and watch you bleed to death,
I swear to God.
Oh, and, and listen, man, come on.
In Oklahoma, you called the
cops on me, you dropped the dime.
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.
I mean, that's pretty admirable, ya know,
I mean, l, I admire that o-kay?
I would've done maybe the same thing.
One less guy, more loot for me.
So, where is it?
Please don't fuckin' kill me, man.
Take all that shit. That's somethin'.
That's somethin'.
I checked every place. It's clean.
You see, heh...
You fuckin' insult me like that, man?
Huh? Three years of my life
in a fucking shithole
and that's what you offer me?
You're a fuckin' piece of fu...
I wonder what's on TV tonight.
I already tried it. It's broken.
Well, I can see that it's plugged in.
Gimme that remote, punk.
I told ya, I tried it.
Doesn't work, right?
Well, somehow that doesn't surprise me.
Well, well, well...
That's all there was, huh?
Fuckin' rich, man, we're rich!
Fuck.
It was them guys, man.
I didn't know anything about it.
Ah, shut up.
You are so fuckin' predictable, hm?
What now?
Well, the sun's out in about five minutes.
That's when I'm goin' in.
Turn yourself in, Johnny boy.
This ain't doin' anybody any good.
You didn't believe a
word I said, did ya, Norm?
Well, goddamn, everybody knows
them convicts headed north!
Shit, folks reported
seein' them as far as Canada!
Them folks are wrong.
You say there's four of 'em in there?
Three.
Ha! Caught you lyin'.
You said there was four of 'em before.
They left one of 'em out on the highway.
Damnit.
Damnit. All right.
You're gonna need backup.
Uncuff me and give my pythons back.
Why, so you can shoot me in the back?
Say I tried to escape?
You'd do that, wouldn't you, Norm?
I wouldn't think twice.
I should've left your
ass back in the desert.
This is such a fuckin' waste of talent.
Ten Reed. Tell me.
how does it feel to be the
wealthiest red man in America?
Heh, It'll feel even better
when we're in Mexico, man.
We'll get there.
Harlan, baby.
Sit up for me for a minute.
Let me give you a hand here. There ya go.
My mother said that if you do this really...
...fast...
...it don't hurt so much.
Listen, uh, we're just
gonna say goodbye, all right?
So, you ain't gonna kill me?
Shit. No, I never
said that, now did I ?
You should never have
fucked with me.
Why don't you do me a favor?
When you get to hell,
tell the devil that uh,
I'll be seeing him.
Hopefully not too soon, ya know?
Now go out like a man.
All right, people, no hard feelings.
No! No!
Now, it's mu fuckin' party.
Now come on!
Shut up. Shut up.
Fuck. Let's go outta here.
I've got one last loose end.
Whatever you say, D.J.
Whatever I say, uh-huh.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
Come on, darlin'. Let's go to Mexico.
When we get to Mexico,
I'll take you out to dinner. Okay?
Damnit.
You fucker!
You can't just shoot me
and fuckin' leave me.
I knew it, it was gonna
be a black cat run.
Fuckin' knew it.
You fucker! Shoot me and fuckin'...
... Ieave me. You can't just fuckin'
leave me here to fuckin'die.
Fuck you. You lied.
It's not fair.
It's not fair?
This is too fuckin' easy,
you know that?
It's too fuckin' easy.
Don't move. Stay right there.
It's not fair.
No more of this. No more of this shit!
I like this, I like this.
You like it, don't you?
Noooooooooooo!
Norm!
Norm.
Would you just look at that?
I've been sh-, sh- ...
Just relax, Norm.
Just relax man.
Ah, the hell with that,
just get me in the damn car.
Alright, listen to me.
I'm gonna get you an ambulance, all right?
You're gonna be fine.
Goddamnit, Johnny, no.
Just get me in the car.
Now just get me in the car.
We gotta get Sara.
Shit.
I figure they'll make a
run for the border, what I figure.
I'd lay odds on it.
You just hold tight, man.
You're gonna be fine. Just breathe.
Oh, I ain't as bad as
it seems, I don't think.
I guess I was wrong about you,
Johnny boy.
That's it? You guess you
were wrong after all of this?
That's the only apology
you're gonna get outta me.
Turn right on this road up here. Johnny
Why am I gonna turn right?
They're on the main road.
You wan-na get there before 'em.
Now, I got laid in this
town when I was seventeen,
I know the roads, damnit.
I swear to God, Norm,
you better be right about this.
I am right, goddamnit.
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?
You know, you can let me go now
because you don't need
me for anything anymore.
Hey. I can't let you go now.
I'll tell what though, huh?
When we get to Guadalajara,
I'll give you a few grand,
buy ya a new dress,
you know, and you just
forget about all this.
Your boyfriend's getting'
on my fuckin' nerves!
I think I'm gonna have
to sit this one out.
You do that, Norm.
You take my three-fifty-seven.
It's got six Super Vel hollow-points in it.
One of these suckers will
knock his dick in the dirt.
Don't you think twice.
He gives you half a chance,
you blow his fucker out of his shoes.
You understand me? You do it for Sara.
If I get that pistol back with
so much as a scratch on it,
I'll chew all the skin off your ass.
Okay, let's play chicken.
Let's see. Come on, let's see.
Come on, you fucker.
Let her go.
Why, because you're in love with her, huh?
That's right. Put that
fucking thing down, man.
Shoot him. Shoot him.
Grissom, goddamnit, shoot him!
Back off!
Put that fucking thing down, man.
What if I stuck this
in her fuckin' eye, huh?
Then she wouldn't be so pretty, would she?
You do that and I swear
to God, I'll kill you right now.
You're not gonna do a fucking thing.
What you're gonna do...
is get the fuck over there and
put the goddamn gun on the roof.
Fuckin' touch her!
Back the fuck up!
Shoot him! Just shoot him, goddamn-it!
Look, kid, put the gun on the roof.
I get the car, you get the girl.
Come on, kid, I give you my word, man.
Take the girl.
Put it on the roof. Do it!
All right!
Don't!
Now!
It's over, man. Now, let her go.
Now, back off!
I gave you the gun.
Back off.
Oh, God, you blew it.
Now, don't move, kid.
You are one stupid,
fucking hillbilly, you know that?
Get in the car.
I'm sorry I lied, ya know?
This is gonna scar, you know that.
Stop Oh, god-damnit!
No, please. Leave him alone.
No, this is too fuckin' easy.
You wait there.
Shit. No.
Sh, sh, sh. Come on.
We're goin' to mexico, baby.
Screw you!
Nice car, kid.
I like this.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop the goddamn truck.
Stop, goddamnit!
Get out of the truck.
What for?
'Cause I'm a goddamn sheriff
standing in the fucking highway,
bleeding here, goddamnit!
Oh, shit.
You got it.
Yeah, uh, okay.
Let's see how fast Johnny can run, huh?
Stop!
Stop!
Son-of-a-bitch! He's a fucking jack rabbit!
Don't !
Don't fuck with me when I'm drivin'.
Son-of-a-bitch!
Johnny!
Oh, see John-ny run!
Come on!
Stupid, son-of-a- ...
