Guys, cut it out, come on.
Had a busy night?
Wasn't too bad.
You must be happy you can go
to bed now.
I think I like blondes..
..or brunettes, it's all the same to me.
One like you must earn a fair bit.

What the hell are you doing?
- Do you have money?
Ofcourse I have money, what did you think.
Darling, would you be nice to me please?
I'm done working for today.
Don't be silly, do some overtime.
Now, just bring me home.
Shut up bitch.
You're not fooling me.
Dirty slut, move it.
Typhus whore.
Are you allright girl?
- Yes, I'm OK.
Amsterdam, the dutch capital, 
is renowned for it's canals,
there are more than 165 canals
with a total length of 16 kilometers.
They stretch the entire city,
and were dug in the 17th century.
They were used for transport of goods 
to magazines.
Amsterdam has 750.000 inhabitants,
who live in about 200.000 houses,
built on poles,
about 100.000 of them. 
So guys, no stomping,
or the city will collapse.
Will you be be carefull?, it's loaded.
Your time has come.
Put it away, it's not a toy.
You forgot the bullets.
You've been in the tub for over half an hour now
And yesterday you were home late.
Is that a reason to shoot your father?
It's almost a quarter to nine,
I will arrive late at school. 
You don't have to wait for me.
You promised to bring me,
They stole my bike remember?
Oh, indeed.
Do you have any idea how much bikes are stolen 
in Amsterdam every year?
No idea, two? three?
Hello, Anneke Visser speaking.
He's been playing with himself in bath 
for thirty minutes already.
Eric, for you.
It's the bureau.

Yeah, I'm trying to raise her decently.
Yeah I'm starting later today.
From a bridge?
OK, I'm on my way.
Did they find my bike?
- No, not yet.
Thought so.
Ready?
- For ages.
Got all your books?
- Yes, move on yourself.
Have you fed the cat?
Goodmorning Amsterdam.
Bye!
- Do your best.

The police will be here in a minute, 
I've called them.
What about my pie?
Who's going to pay for that?
Couldn't you have been more carefull?
Will you return them to me?
I haven't got whole day, toast cock.
Eric, we started already.
- Had to drop by the baker.
That's her?
Yes, mutilated with a knife
Whoever did this must be barking mad.
Who is she?
- A hooker. Potter is identifying her.
Raped?
- Doesn't look like it.
She was stabbed down the road,
then dragged to the canal.
This is where she hung?
- Yep, from her feet.
With a Rolling Hitch knot.
- A Sailor?
Possibly.
Any witnesses?
- Noone, and no fingerprints.
It must have happened between 
1 and 3 this morning.
They will start dragging in a minute, 
maybe they'll find something.
He must have a strange sense of humour, 
to display his victim like this.
He seems to be proud of it.
Eric, we've found a witness.
- Are you sure?
Tell him what you just told me.
It was a monster.
- A monster?
Yes, I've seen it, a big 
black monster.
With big claws and feet.
It came out of the canal.
- He had a boat?
No, out of the water itself.
I've seen it with these very eyes.
What do you think?
- Hard to say.
She's not a trustworthy witness.
- But, it's the only one we've got.
What do you think she meant with
'clawed black monster'?
No idea, does your mother
in law have an alibi?
Let's just wait for the autopsy.
Maybe the inquiry will yield something,
I put 8 men on it.
Let's hope so,
It's a tough case like this.
What are you sitting in the dark for?
Willy is in trance,
he's trying to contact his deceased aunt.
Oh, no, not again.
Wasn't he going to help you on your homework?
- Finished already.
I can't do it this way.
- Did you contact her?
Almost, but the surroundings 
aren't good.
I bet they aren't.
It requires deep concentration.
I'm going to retry at home.
Oh man, I think you know jackshit about it.
- Can I turn on the light again Willy?
Yes, Willy can't concentrate here anyway.
You're just jealous I'm gifted.
- pff, gifted.
Eating with us?
- No, mom made macaroni.
Bye Mr. Visser.
- Say hello to your aunt.
Will do, see you tomorrow Anneke.
- Bye.
How did school go?
- Fine. Did you bring peanutbutter?
No.
- Are we out?
Yesterday you forgot as well.
- Why don't you do the shopping from now on.
There's more to life than peanutbutter
dear.
Yes, apple sirup,
And you didn't bring that either.
Why don't you set the table.
- What's for dinner?
Sprouts in chocolate sauce.
- I don't like French food.
one, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight
nine, 2.25 meter.
- 03:15h
2.25 meter.
We're wasting time
Are you sure this is the right spot?
- We're right above the tube.
Doesn't look like it,
Nothing but clear water.
We could be above the sewer
pulling up buckets of shit.
- Ssht, they might hear us.
I think this plant is closed down.
We'd be waiting forever.
It can happen any minute now,
One dump, 
and they're framed.
I better dump something myself then.
Didn't I tell you, move it.
The bastards.
We've got them.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
pull it in.
It's stuck.
- Stuck? 
What would it be?
- Heavy toxins.
Look at that.
Let's get out of here, Kees.
Let's go, this is creepy.
Lift the anchor.
You did fill the tank, did you?
Hendrick?
Why stop?
- I saw a guy.
Where?
- On the shore.
I didn't see anyhting.
- yeah.
Had a nice conversation?
He vanished.
- It's because of the stuff we transport.
Makes one see funny things.
Well, I swear I saw someone.
The morning shift found the boat.
- Plant crew didn't notice anything?
No it was closed for maintenance
and the two guards didn't see a thing.
Hey, Eric.
What were they doing?
Sampling the water.
Looks like the water sampled them.
You recon it's the same guy?
- The same killer?
Let the experts make that out, but two of 
these lunatics would be too great a coincidence.
I warned you, pal 
Listen, or I'll slap your face.
- Here you go.
Who do you think you are,
cocksucker.
Take it easy.
Make one more pic, and I'll 
stuff that lense down your throat.
Hear hear, no half work.
I don't like my picture taken.
Hello, Eric.
It's been while.
- 13 years I guess.
Eric, this is John Van Meegeren,
water police.
We know oneanother, you're here to help?
- They want me to assist you
dragging them corpses from the water.
Vermeer, come over here please.
You haven't changed much.
- You think so?
Still the prettiest of the two of us.
Still angry at me?
- It's sucks when someone steals your girlfriend.
Know all about it.
Heard she left you in return?
- Left three years ago,
with this painter,
is living in France these days.
Occasionally visits, 
for Anneke's sake.
Saved me trouble, but don't do it again.
- Whatever you say.
Learned anything?
- Not yet.
We're inspecting the canalfloor.
Troubled water, hard to see a thing.
He's found something?
What's that?
- Depth gauge.
Standard diver's equipment.
Are we dealing with a diver?
Who knows how long it's been there.
Take it to the lab, find out where it's from
and how long it's been there.
A diver terrorising the Amsterdam canals.
Bad for our reputation.
- It's going to be a great summer.
A diver?
Isn't that farfetched?
Excluding the Loch Ness monster,
it's the safest assumption.
Without a single witness?
- Exactly why.
The canals are an excellent hidingplace.
What do you think, John ?
He must have taken the two of them
by surprise.
Unlikely the killer approached them by boat.
- Some people have kinky hobbies.
Got enough manpower?
- for the time being.
Let me know when you need anything.
Don't want to see more of those flags.
Here, all registered dutch divers.
Neat,
- But 8.500 suspects.
You must be among them.
- I have an alibi.
Tracked down the cabdriver as well.
Did he mention anything?
- Picked up the victim around 1:30
Claims she made a move on him.
So he "threw her out of the car."
Must have been the other way around.
He has an alibi for the remainder of the night.
- Was to be expected.
Hello? Yes.
Great, spit it out.
Thanks.
They've found a black piece of
rubber on the tip of the anchor.
Down at the lab.
- Wetsuit?
We're on the right track.
Is Potter still analysing that rope?
- Which?
With which our girl was hung 
from the bridge.
Identified the maker, 
Resellers are being investigated.
Seems people here are working 
for a change. It's nearing 12:00.
Lunchbreak?
- Only when you can handle it.
16 stabs, 8 lethal.
It was such a mess inside, 
dislocated organs.
Broken neck, two broken ribs,
splintered nose, lungs full of water,
concussions, grazes..
That guy must be an animal.
Weapon?
- A sharp knife.
look, the tip.
Came off by the fierce stabbing.
A fleshknife probably,
25 to 30 cm.
Stomach contained some red wine
and two hamburgers.
Almost certainly Mc Dreck.
Was she dead already, 
entering the water?
Not yet, which explains the water 
in the lungs.
She was finished off submerged.
Atleast she passed away
prior to being hung.
Put this one back in the fridge, Theo.
And now for our fishingmates.
This is even worse.
I'll spare you the unimportant details.
One was decapitated.
Most likely done under water.
They ate vegetarian food.
lentils, millet, carrotjuice..
..but one of them had a beefburger afterwards.
A knife was used once more, 
but of a different, sawtooth type.
I've seen this once before
Turned out to be a..
..Diver's knife?
- Yes.
A diver's knife?
They all carry one.
To cut themselves free
in case of emergency.
But in this case it's been used for 
something completely different.
Now we know what we're after,
how will we catch that cocksucker.
You tell me, it's a fellow diver afterall.
All I know is he's probably strong, 
wearing a black suit,
and missing his depth gauge.
Not enough for an arrest.
- No, we're not making much progress.
Besides the registered ones, 
there are 10.000 hobby divers as well.
Let's concentrate on Amsterdam.
Since he seems to know the canals pretty well.
More coffee gentlemen?
- Yeah, nice.
That case of the murdered quiz master..
you didn't have much clues back then either..
- You followed that case?
It was in all papers.
- We had nothing.
Ofcourse we suspected all 
those lost candidates.
But they all had an alibi.
Took us 9 weeks to track down the killer.
What put you on his trail?
Patience, intuition.
And being lucky,
can't  work without being lucky.
Can I help you?
Just looking around.
- Want to become a member?
Nope, I'm an inspector.
- Thought so.
You guys messed up my registration this morning.
- Just doing our job.
And what may be your job?
- I'm the administrator.
Told this before, this morning.
So why are you here again?
It's the biggest diving club in Amsterdam.
Of the Netherlands, and the best also.
You're not the only person that's bothered.
OK when I look around?
- Can't refuse you.
Here we keep the gear.
Freely available to members.
How many does the club have?
- Over 1400.
Lose alot of these?
- What do you mean?
Whether they bring back the leant stuff.
It's not much of an issue.
Do you suspect one of our members?
- People do crazy things.
Our members are respectable. 
They're not swimming in those filthy canals.
Can't see a thing in them, and all 
the dumped junk makes one sick.
No, we rather dive at sea.
Abroad, shipwrecks and coral reefs.
Can't imagine someone 
diving the canals for pleasure.
Quite the arsenal.
- Got all the required permits.
Mandatory equipment.
Better be carefull, it's sharp.
I know.
And this? mandatory as well?
For recreational fishing.
- For sharks?
Only, when they get nosy.
Now if you'd excuse me.
I wont keep you from your work.
Good afternoon.
- Hello.
Need a hand?
- Yes please.
They're light in the water, 
but a burden on land.
You a member?
- Not yet.
Been doing this for long?
- Since a few weeks.
Still getting used to it.
Gives me sore legs.
Why'd you start it.
- Friend's recommendation.
You interested?
- Maybe.
Went well Laura?
- Fine.
Got your prime suspect?
Be carefull, he's a cop.
Someone forgot to pay his parkingtickets?
- Nah, parking is not an issue for him.
For whom?
- We're investigating a murder.
Ah, the works.
Can I offer you a drink?
Sure, gimme a minute, 
got to shower and dress.
I'll wait.
See you in 15 minutes at the canteen.
Thought cops weren't allowed 
to drink at work?
I never was good at my work.
Made progress?
- Somewhat, yes.
Martin.
How are you pal?
- Busy, busy.
Visser, Amsterdam police.
Martin Ruysdael.
- Pleasure to meet you.
They're investigating those murders.
Yeah, read about them.
Horrible, hard to imagine this stuff 
still happens.
Want a drink?
- I'll have a bourbon.
Any idea who did it?
Nope, Working on it.
You're a member here?
Used to be, years ago.
Even was on the board.
But I got busy practicing.
You're a doctor?
- Psychotherapist.
Here you go Martin.
- Thanks.
No, didn't have time for it anymore
my last dive was some 3 years ago.
Did you ever dive?
- Never.
Recommended, refreshes the mind.
Especially those suthern waters,
the coral, the fauna. Pure beauty.
I'll think about it.
Martin, here already .
Hi.
- You met already?
He must have gotten you into diving? 
- Yes.
Spoke about me before?
Officers need to know everyhting,
But I didnt tell much.
I'm afraid I'll have to skip the drink.
Leaving so soon?
- Attending a concert tonight.
Another day?
- Who knows.
Shall we, darling?
- Yes.

Thanks.
What's the rush?
Sorry, didn't see you.
As long as the Lord sees us.
Exactly. Halleluja.
Bummer, such a nice girl, in such a club.

Joop, we're getting rich.
Two flags?
Red where she was lost, and yellow
where she's been found.
Why'd he drag her down the canal that far?
Swimming lessons?
He seems to like playing with 
his victims.
We know who, where, and the time
that's it
but the inquiry didn't learn us much.
Nothing about a rope yet?
- Nope, work in progress.
The wetsuit patch?
- Regular suit.
Knife's tip?
- Sold everywhere.
Depth gauge?
- Nothing either.
What about the patrol boat?
Had to beg for 2 boats.
Claim to be people short.
Better than nothing. 
- We'll have to wait for his mistake.
I don't want to wait for that.
Visser.
Yes.

I'm not the only one incontent.
We must stop that guy.
I demand clarity in this case
4 victims in 4 days.
People must get impatient.
We're still researching things,
but meanwhile we can't do much.
Still no witnesses?
- Just the beggar.
And a bunch of fish perhaps..
The mayor called me earlier
He had high guests and asked whether 
he could still do a boat tour safely.
What did you advise?
- To stay away from the railing.
I know how you must feel, Eric.
Powerless, waiting for a that one clue.
But it's not enough, we've got to 
do something.
We couldn't close the canals.
It'd be safe allright.
Drastic, but safe.
Hey Eric, stop looking depressed.
- What's there to laugh about?
The lab returned the depth gauge.
It hasn't been there longer than 3 days.
- So it's the killer's?
Highly likely.
It also contained salt.
- What does that mean?
We can forget about freshwater divers.
Our suspect is a sailor or in offshoring.
Once the exact water type gets determined  
we'll know alot more.
And that's determined how?
Chemical deposits in the meter.
So that's what we're working on.
- Nice.
Potter knows where I'm heading.
I'm off to some art gallery.











So, you like art? 
- I like beautifull things.
How did you find me? 
- I am a cop, remember?
I thought you were busy with something, not?
I took my day off today.
Can we dine together this evening 
or do you have other plans?
I have no other plans.
The table is already reserved, 
So if you won't join me i will have to ask someone else.
You do not waste time. 
- sometimes.
Pick me up around 6 a.m at my place.
Where do you live? 
- You're a detective remember?
I would like to reserve a table.
This evening, for two.
Beautiful place. You have taste.
I may have a dirty job, but that doesnt mean i like dirty food.
Doesn't it bother your daughter,
to stay home alone?
She knows of my work schedules.
She can take care of herself.
Must be hard for a girl having a dad like you.
I would be lost behind a desk, 
with a boring daily routine.
You are not made for that. 
- I do my job and try to live a little.
But lets talk about you now. 
- There's nothing there to say.
Just about life, 
the work and the men in your life.
I believe that you already know all about that, 
detective.
I know you were Married, 
lived abroad, and since a year and half
work at the museum. 
- You carried out quite an investigation.
We have computers at the station. 
You input a name and 'voila'
And they tell you all you want to know. 
- everything? 
Almost everything. 
Enough is left for us to talk about.
What a relief.
Are you seeing that psychiatrist in private? 
- Martin?
No, he's only a friend. 
He treated me for 6 months.
I cracked when I lost my husband. 
someone sent me to him.
Now i visit him every week.
And sometimes we go out together.
He's a good friend, that's all.
- He introduced you with the diving?
he said to me that that would help 
me to get back on track.
I believe he was right. 
- He doesn't dive any more?
Not since the accident of his 
childhood friend.
What kind of accident? 
- He never wanted to tell me.
But after that he quit diving. 
- He told me he was too busy with his work.
He just doesn't like to talk about it.
Is he on your little list? 
- Tonight you're the only one on my list.
Is this ok? 
- Where did you get that?
Weapon of my father, hold it.
You said you would get something from the killer.
What did you expect? 
his picture?
This will make it more difficult.
Are you telling me you can't do it?
It's ok, give it. 
- are you sure?
Give me the damn bullet.
Hey! watch it, you're fucking up the map.
That's where he is.
Are you sure this is the place?
Are you Afraid?
- No.
This is it.
So what are we going to do now?
- What do you mean?
What if we run into him?
- Then we grab him.
No way. 
He's got a knife.
Now what? 
You wanted to help your dad.
No need to be scared. 
I know Judo
What was that?
Probably a rat.
- There are rats here?
Maybe it was 'him'?
Think so?
You chickenshit. 
Wait here.
Where are you going?
- I'm going to investigate.
Please be carefull
- Yes.
Willy?
Willy, are you ok?
Willy.
You fucking piece of shit.
- I was joking. I'm sorry
Don't be such an ass!
You slimey monkeydick.
Help me.
- Happy now?
Not so smart now are we.
- Stop it. Get me out. He's here!
I thought you said you did Judo?
- Fuck you. Help me!
Sure thing captain corageous.
Only if you promise to do my math homework.
- I promise.
And all my french.
- I promise!
Fuck.
- Stop whining.
If you really were a psychic
you would know about the water.
You're just a fake.
I hope that stain will come out.
If it doesn't at least i will have 
a nice souvenier.
Good night.
- Make sure you don't go near the canals.
Are you worried?
- I would like to see you again.
Call me. 
Bye.
Good night.
Allright,
You got me. I give up.
I'm the killer you guys are looking for.
I'm turning myself in.
You're looking at atleast 20 years grandpa.
I'm ready to repent - Got any last requests?
- Cup of coffee?
How long do you plan to lie around there?
We have to leave.
I'll be out in a minute
- I want to be on time.
You know what my parents are like.
- Yeah.
The mayor expects me.
There you are.
As I was telling the DA and the chief of police.
I'm not impressed by the results 
of the investigation so far.
Is this killer in the canals going 
to be our new tourist attraction this summer?
Besides our tulips and windmills?
Or even our beloved clogs?
Can we prevent that scenario?
I understand. 
But rest assure. 
Our forces are doing everything to catch him.
I expect no less.
Amsterdam means everything to me.
There have been times when our 
reputation wasn't that good.
But in the last couple of years 
we greatly improved that.
We just cleaned our canals.
And now they're already filled with bodies.
Just look at the headlines.
Even the foreign press picked it up.
Our bad reputation is looming again.
We are turning into an 
international joke this way gentlemen.
And when I listen to the chief of police.
Even he can't give me good news.
They are working on some leads.
Those things take time.
Are you sure the right man is on the job?
No doubt, Eric Visser is one of our best people.
Sometimes a new face can see 
different things.
Didn't you have someone in mind commissioner?
I'm sure Eric Visser is a good detective.
But when i look at the results of the investigation so far 
it makes me wonder..
Whether he's the right man in this situation.
You have other people in mind?
There are several that come to mind, yes.
What do you think about that?
I don't think it's right to look for a 
scapegoat in this situation.
There are several explanations for why this 
investigation is going nowhere.
Don't you think someone else..
- Eric has my complete confidence.
I'm not planning to take him off the job.
Fine.
That's your choice.
And your responsibility.
Let's just wait for now.
But if i don't see results within 3 days. 
I'm making changes.
If he fails you're going down with him.
- He won't.
I hope.
How are you feeling now?
Not bad.
No depressions?
No.
You sleep well?
Yes. And you ?
Yes. Why do you ask?
You always ask me things. Now i would like 
to know something about you.
I'm the Psychiatrist here.
If it keeps going this good with me
You might loose me as a client.
Is that what you want?
No, i still like comming here.
Just to talk.
You want to go home already?
- No, i grew tired of lying down.
It's meant to be relaxing.
You have a sigarette for me?
Why don't you tell me?
- What?
You promised no secrets towards me.
I met that cop again.
- Did he bother you.
He asked me out for diner.
- Did you go?
Yes. I had a great time.
Did he ask you about the killings?
He never brought that up.
- What did he want?
I think he likes me.
- And you?
He's a cute guy.
- You have feelings for him?
You're not jealous i hope?
- I'm glad things are going your way.
Maybe you wont need me anymore soon.
What a shitjob at this hour.
Want a sigarette?
No thanks.
These patrols are just a waste of time.
What a bullshit.
Like these patrols will make a difference.
Shut up.
- What?
Thought I heard something.
Turn of the engine.
It's probably just a piece of wood.
You need to relax a little.
Relax? He killed 5 people!
- Yes. And we're next.
Hear that?
- What now? Stop over reacting.
Look out.
Merry christmas.
How sure are we?
- Sure enough to talk to him.
What do we know about him?.
- He worked for 12 years on an oil rig in the north sea.
He got fired 2 months ago.
He was a drunk and had a bad temper.
They said he worked someone over with a broken bottle. 
- Nice guy.
The rope we found was the same he worked with.
The depth meter also fit the profile. 
Oil remnants match ours.
Diving suit matches up also.
- Who tipped us?
An ex-colleague of him spoke to him in the city 
and said he was acting weird.
He was talking about taking revenge.
Let's go get this guy.
See what he has to tell us.
Where is he?
- Over there. In the Hotel.
First floor frontside.
He's still in there?
- We're not sure about that.
He entered 30 minutes ago but after that 
we didnt see him anymore.
Hallo, Herman?
See anything?
- Still nothing.
Maybe he already left.
- We have to take our chances.
If he's not in there we're screwed.
- We can't wait any longer. 
You stay here. 
Come.
I never get the fun parts.
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
- Police.
He's gone.
Eric.
Taxi?
He's going north. Do we have backup there?
- Cavalery received request. We're going there now.
You plan on hanging there all day?
You can remain silence for another hour. 
And whole night even. I don't care.
It's not going to help you. You're not going anywhere.
- You got the wrong guy, asshole!
No? Explain why not!
Fuck you.
Innocent people don't run from the police.
Bad consciousness?
Why did you do it? Revenge?
Is that why you butchered 5 innocent people.
I want a lawyer.
- Listen asshole.
I grow tired of this. What do you think we're doing here?
GOATFUCKER!
Your turn.
So....
So you don't want to talk? 
Goatfucker.
Congratualtions 
- Why?
Don't be modest. The mayor sent his regards.
He's very relieved.
I think that's a little too soon.
- Why? You got the guy.
I thought the mayor should be the 
first to hear this good news.
He didn't confess anything.
So no good news yet.
C'mon..
Everything points in his direction.
You know what your problem is?
You always see clouds at the horizon.
What are you doing here?
- Hi. Can I come in?
Don't you know what time it is?
- Too late. Were you sleeping?
like everbody else at this hour.
Sorry.
- It's ok.
I just wanted to see you.
- Really?
You better throw me out.
Sigarette?
- No thanks.
You want a drink ?
- No.
Sandwich?
- Not hungry.
I saw on TV you arrested somebody.
That's correct.
You don't look that happy.
I don't think we have the right guy.
- And now?
I don't know. Wait
Are you sure there's nothing I can do for you?
Oh man...
I needed that.
Jesus. What's next?
Let's find ourselves a lamp.
There we go.
Lemme light this sucker.
What now?
What the hell is that?
Jesus Christ.
Help!
Help!
Police? Brouwer here.
I just witnessed something wierd.
Did you find Eric yet?
- No. I have no idea where he is.
He didn't come home last night.
- I think I already know...
I don't like you diving alone John.
How many more killers do you think 
are swimming around here?
I told you we're not sure if 
we got the right guy.
Don't worry about me.
Is this the right spot?
- Yes. The boat should be here.
OK. 
I'll go take a look.
How would you know if something is wrong?
- Tuggs on the cord.
One tugg means everthing's OK.
Five tuggs means something's wrong.
He should be in the boat by now.
- How do you know?
The bubbles.
- What bubbles?
The bubbles are gone now.
They are being kept in the boat now.
Oh..I see.
What's happening?
- I don't know.
He's ok.
Does that look normal to you?
Pull.
It's stuck!
Quickly! 
Get him aboard.
It's too late! He's dead.
- Quickly, goddamned!
There!
Look at the bubbles! It's him!
After those bubbles! It's him.
621...
We got the bastard.
What do you mean?
- He swam into the lock. It's a dead end.
We have to close our side quickly.
Finally...he's ours.
Start pumping it dry.
Where were you Eric?
- John?
They took him away already.
We tried to call you.
He should have never dived alone.
- I couldn't stop him.
It's not your fault.
At least we got the guy.
He's trapped like a rat in a box.
Those bubbles?
He knows we got him.
He hasn't moved an inch.
He hasn't moved?
- No.
Finally.
Motherfucker.
I'm sorry Eric.
I should have known better.
He's smart and wants to embarrass us.
We gave him plenty of time to escape.
604, HQ here, come in.
604, I'm here.
We got a break and entry in the Amsterdam marina.
Looks like it could be your guy.
- We're on it.
He's in that building.
- What's he doing there?
No idea.
But i think he's still in there.
Shit.
- Are you ok?
Yes. 
He must be wounded.
How do you start this thing?
- Press the button and floor it.
Jesus christ.
There he is. The bastard
Oh fuck!
Shit.
He's opening his eyes.
Why are you here?
- I was in the neighbourhood.
Are you ok Eric? Are you hurting?
Did you get him?
No. When we found you he had already left.
What time is it?
Where is Aneke?
She's staying with a classmate.
Willy... What time is it?
1 AM.
Time flies when you're having fun.
I got him. Right in his diving glasses.
We found some glass yes. 
But we're not sure if you hit him.
Let's get back to work.
No time to loose.
You need to rest. it's but a flesh wound
The harpoon grazed your bone.
The doctor said you need at least 3 days rest.
Jesus.
How are we doing Mr. Visser?
- Perfect, doctor.
You were very lucky.
Everything will be ok.
Within a few days those stitches 
will come out,
And it looks like it will only 
be a minor scar.
You should leave. 
The patient needs his rest
I need to talk to him so more.
- Tough luck, I sedated him just now.
He's gone for the next 12 hours.
Fine. I'll return tomorrow.
Can I give you a ride?
- Yes.
Ah..it's you.
He hasn't returned yet.
I know i'm a bit early.
- You make yourself at home.
I have to leave. My mother is sickly.
Nothing bad I hope?
- To much taffy.
She always eats to much taffy,
and no matter what i say, she never listens.
And now she's sick.
Wish her the best from me.
- I will.
Why don't you have some sherry.
I know I did.
Martin?
Martin?
Martin?
Are you playing tricks on me?
Is this some sort of new therapy?
Hello. Surgery department.
Who do you want to speak too?
Mr. Visser?
It's very important. I have to speak with him.
- Let me go take a look.
Sorry, he's asleep.
Can I take a message?
Tell him Laura called.
Tell them the guy they're after is...
- One second, pen stopped working.
Quick, it's important, 
you must warn Eric.
I know the who's the killer.
Hello madam?
Hey kids
- We're here for Eric Visser.
3th floor, room 316.
See, he's still there.
- I really did see it.
Don't mention it to him.
- Just want to warn him.
How can he be in danger 
here at the hospital?
Maybe he wont stay for long?
- 4 days, the doctor said.
You'll see I'm right.
I just know such things.
You better concentrate on not to falling
in the water again.
The guys'
- Nice of them.
Fresh clothes.
What's new?
Nope, got nothing to cheer you up.
Mind if I take an apple?
- Go ahead.
Someone called for you Mr. Visser.
- Oh, Who?
A woman named Laura.
- What did she want?
She hung on me unexpected.
- Said anything?
Unclear, she said you were looking 
for someone.
And she knew who.
- When was this?
About 10 minutes ago.
- Why didn't you warn me?
You were sleeping
- From where did she call?
She didn't mention that.
- It's wednesday, right?
What's the time?
- 17:30, why?
Mr. Visser, what are you doing?
Eric, what's up?
- We must hurry or we'll be late.
Late for what?
- Mr. Visser.
Hey dad.
- Daddy has to leave.
Whereto?
- I'll tell you later.
Tell me whats going on.
- Can't it go faster.
Eric,
It's still new, I'm breaking it in.
It's allright, it's allright.
No need for that.
I thought it was you.
Warn the bureau, we need help.
I think you have some explaining to do.
I've known him forever.
We were friends.
We started diving together.
He later became a professional 
at a salvaging company.
What happened?
- 3 years ago,
a ship at the North Sea lost barrels 
of chemicals,
they told him it was harmless.
What was in them?
- Uranium hexafluoride.
But they didn't tell him.
- Who didn't?
High ranking corporate pigs were involved.
It went wrong?
- "accident at work" they called it.
A barrel ruptured underwater.
He was disfigured.
The radioactivity affected his brain.
I watched him change, but couldn't help.
He secluded himself, shunned others.
I lost the appetite for diving.
I visited him, tried to help out.
He asked me to lend him my divinggear.
I agreed ofcourse.
I wanted him to be happy.
I had no idea of his plans.
Revenge at society,
butchering of innocents.
Still can't believe it.
He's sick, terribly ill.
Almost there.
He's in there, but no hurry, 
he will not dive again.
Shouldn't we return?
Your daughter might get worried.
She can take care of herself. 
- Booked dinner tonight. 
Really?
- For three, candlelight, fish restaurant. 
Fish restaurant?
- Don't you like fish?
Ehhh nope.
I don't like anything that's from the water.
I came out of the water, remember.
- You're the exception.
Mr. funny pants.
Mr. funny pants.
