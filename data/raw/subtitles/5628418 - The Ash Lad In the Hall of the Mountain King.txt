Far, far inside the mountain world, -
-past all the blue mountains in the horizon and even a little
bit further, lies a enormous mountain.
A mountain no human
dares to approach.
For an ancient legend says
that deep in the mountain -
- a dreadful troll sleeps.
The Mountain King.
According to the legend, only one thing
will make the troll wake up:
If a princess is not
married before reaching the age of 18 years.
Kristin, are you ready?
So even if the princesses
want to or not, -
- all kings have made sure
to find a bridegroom for their daughters -
-before it's too late.
Welcome.
Your Royal Highnesses.
My lord.
It is with pleasure and humility that
I, Prince Fredrik of Denmark, -
- receives the hand of your daughter
in marriage.
They are simple farmers.
They do not understand the language of the nobles.
Good day, it's good to be here.
The big bear came straight towards me,
but I'm brave.
So I threw myself on top of the bear, -
-put my arms around his neck
and squeezed, until...
the bear was dead on the grass.
Kristin, now you have to listen to me.
I am the king, and the king demands
that you marry Fredrik!
I don't want to get married!
It's your birthday tomorrow,
and you will get married.
If the story is true and the princess
is not married before her 18th birthday, -
- the Mountain King will wake up
and come for her, and take her to the mountain.
There she will be spellbound and become
a slave to him for the rest of her life.
Kristin?
Kristin!
Hello?
Now we're even.
Hello. Espen.
We don't need to shake hands.
It's a really stupid custom.
Why don't we just wave our
hands back and forth?
No, why don't we stand on one leg?
- Do you always talk this much?
- Only after near-death experiences.
If you don't stop talking,
you will experience one more.
Are you hungry?
I have never seen anyone
eat so quick before.
I haven't had an appetite in a while.
You've got it back.
Where are you going?
I have to leave.
Thank you for the food.
- I don't even know what your name is.
- Maybe we will meet again.
If you manage to stack your feet.
Good morning, brothers.
What do you mean by 'good morning'?
We've been up working since sunrise.
- Yes, we actually have.
- Life isn't all about working.
Hi, dad.
The birds have eaten our stocks again.
Didn't I tell you to make a scarecrow?
- It was Espen's job.
- Yes, it was Espen's job.
- Did you buy what I requested?
- Yes.
You will not believe it.
There was a girl on a horse...
Espen!
- And then I fell into the river...
- Boys, get the bow and snare.
- We have worked all day.
- We must go hunting.
- Can I come?
- NO!
It's time for everyone to take responsibility
and start growing up.
- Yes.
- Good.
You stay here and watch the house.
Don't do anything.
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.
- That's good, my boy.
- Here.
Sit down and play with the ashes.
That's the only thing you're good at.
A troll ...!
I'm not afraid of any troll!
Oh no!
No, no, no!
- Of course we will.
- And the rest we can salt.
I can explain.
I just sat and played with the ashes,
when I heard heavy footsteps outside.
- It was a troll.
- What have you done?
It's true.
Or, I believe it was a troll.
Foolish boy...
You ash lad.
There's no point.
Everything is destroyed.
It was the only picture of her that existed.
Good day, simple farmers.
Have you seen a princess
pass by on a majestic horse?
Long brown hair. Strikingly beautiful.
The princess, not the horse.
We have not seen her.
What about you?
No.
- No?
- He is lying, my lord.
I will break his neck!
How can he talk if his neck is broken?
Fool.
Tell me what you know.
Don't listen to him.
His stories are all lies.
He said he saw a troll yesterday.
So he believes in the old legend?
- Believes in the old ...?
- Legend.
- Le...?
- Legend.
Oh. What legend?
That a troll will take the princess
if she is unmarried when she turns 18.
The king has promised that the one who finds the princess,
shall have her and half the kingdom.
And it will be me.
Will they just give her away
to anyone?
The princess will marry me.
That's something everyone knows.
And when we are married, -
- I'll make sure that she knows her place.
Simple farmers.
Here. That's all I have.
You have to find the princess.
Let's hope we'll get a reward for it.
We will rebuild the farm again, boys.
What about me?
- From now on you have to manage yourself.
- But I can stay and help you.
- You can help me by leaving.
- But I can...
No! Go.
I never want to see you again.
Per...
Come on.
Look what I found.
- What did you find?
- A broken mirror.
What need do you have for such scrap?
You never know, it might come in handy.
I found, I found.
What did you find now, then?
Just drop it.
It might come in handy.
Help!
- Help! Help me!
- Someone needs help.
- We don't have time.
- Are we going to leave someone in need ...?
We have enough problems as it is,
thanks to you.
- I want to see who it is.
- Come on, Paul. Come.
Goodbye, Ash Lad.
- Come and help me!
- I can hear you.
Help me!
Help! Come closer.
Oh, thank you.
I was chopping some wood,
when I managed to get my nose stuck.
Are you just going to stand there and stare
or are you going to help me?
Sorry.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
You have to use the axe.
- Do you want me to chop your nose off?
- Are you crazy?
Use the axe to make the crack wider.
Oh, come on.
I've been stuck here for a long time
without food and water.
I don't have much,
but I have a potato.
What are you doing out here?
You are deep into the woods.
- I'm looking for the princess.
- So it has happened.
- The Mountain King has taken her.
- Isn't that just a fairytale?
There's always something
that's true in all fairytales.
Forget about it!
It's too dangerous.
To save the princess is my only hope.
Listen, boy. According to the legend
there is one sword, -
- that can kill the Mountain King.
- The sword Tvegir.
- Where can I find it?
- It's too dangerous.
- I have to know.
The sword was lost many years ago
in a dangerous swamp.
There is something in the swamp.
Something evil.
Do you know where this swamp is?
I will give you my map
because you helped me.
This map will show you
wherever you wish to go.
Thank you.
You have to ask the map.
Map, show me the way to Tvegir.
That's not good enough.
You have to ask nicely.
Please.
Goodbye then, Ash Lad!
Ouch, my nose!
- You don't understand.
- I am the king!
- You will marry Fredrik!
- I don't want to get married!
- Do you think robbers have taken her?
- There are worse things out in the woods.
Are you talking about the troll again?
It's an old myth, and you know it.
The troll will force her to marry him.
Your Majesty...
We have found...
Your Majesty...
We found her horse.
Or what's left of it.
- We also found this.
- What's that?
We believe it's a tooth.
The Mountain King.
Per, how long has it been since we ate?
I'm starting to get hungry.
Do you think it belongs to someone?
No one will notice if we take just one.
- Each?
- Yes, one each.
An unusual color.
- But they are really good.
- The best apples in the world.
- Do you like our apples?
- We didn't know it was yours.
We have more apples at our house,
and you can eat as many as you want.
- As many as we want?
- Do you want to come?
Where is the apples?
Here, take one more bite and then we'll take you there.
Look, it's Espen!
Hello. Come sit down.
There is enough food for everyone.
Let us never leave.
Are you allright?
Maybe you would like a golden apple?
Eat.
Come on, eat.
There you go.
I'm looking forward to marry you.
I'm so happy I met you.
Do you think I'm pretty?
- I love you so much.
- And we love you, Espen.
- Let's explore our new home.
- But all the good food is here.
We have plenty of time to eat later.
We will be here forever.
- Excuse me, may we leave the table?
- Of course.
You go and have fun while we prepare
lots of delicious food for you.
Come, come.
Come.
This is like a Palace.
- Look at that.
- Where are we going?
We have to get out. This is all an illusion.
The apples we ate were enchanted.
Why do you always have to destroy everything?
First you burn down the farm, -
- and now you are dragging us away
from the beautiful girls.
Wake up!
We are getting married!
Run!
Don't run! We are getting married!
- What was that?
- Hulder's!
You won't get away!
Here we are!
Don't leave us! Wait!
- They are right behind us!
- We are getting married!
Quick!
No!
No!
- Thank you for saving us, Espen.
- Don't think about it.
Next time you see a beautiful girl
with a cows tail, continue walking.
If trolls exist,
how come nobody have seen them before?
They turn to stone in daylight.
They only come out at night.
- How do you know that?
- That's just how it is.
Is there anything else I should know?
Do dragons exist too?
- Do unicorns exist?
- Don't be stupid.
- Why is that more stupid than a troll?
- Because it's absurd. It's a horse with a horn on his forehead.
When we find the sword we can save the princess.
Raw meat is the best I know of.
Oh my...
- I found, I found.
- A ball of yarn.
- Are you going to knit know?
- You never know.
- Paul looks tired.
- We're nearly there.
Wait for me. Wait.
Paul!
- Paul, where are you going?
- A hero cannot work on an empty stomach.
We don't have enough money.
At least one of us thought about that.
Espen, order three big beers.
And three bowls of porridge.
And some salted meat.
And three big cinnamon buns.
Is that really necessary?
The hero will starve without a cinnamon bun.
If I don't get some food soon I will hit somebody.
- Here you go, here are some wine.
- Finally. About time.
One for you.
And one for you.
Wait, wait, wait.
Is it just me or does it smell like a fart?
- It smells like a fart.
- Not just a fart.
It also smells like a cowshed and burned socks -
- with a hint of a scalp.
Let me taste.
It taste like a fart.
Serve me something good, or I will buy
the inn and burn it to the ground -
- as a gift to humanity. Thank you.
We have to find the princess before everyone else.
Our plan depends on it.
Do you think the Mountain King have taken her?
Don't be silly, little-Jan.
Trolls doesn't exist.
Thank you. And three bowls of porridge with salted meat
and three cinnamon buns.
- Coming right up.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
My lord...
- What?
- Guess who I just saw?
Cheers, brothers.
- Shall we take a look at the map?
- Yes.
Map, show us the way to Tvegir, please.
- Now that's what I call magic.
- There is the swamp the old lady was talking about.
The sword must be in the pond.
That is where we are going.
If we can find the sword,
we can save the princess.
So we meet again. I forgot to introduce
myself. I'm Prince Fredrik.
Espen "Ash Lad".
Sorry I acted like a jerk last time we met.
The princess is my fiance.
We are in love and she means everything to me.
If you have information that can help me find her, -
- I will make sure you will get a big reward.
How big?
Enough to rebuild the farm and some more.
So if you know something or are in posession of, -
- let us say a magic map...
Funny you would mention that, becase we found...
If you are so in love,
why did she leave the wedding?
- Tell me where she is!
- We can probably find a solution.
Espen, give him the map.
- No.
- You have to give him the map.
- Give him the map, now.
- Give me the map.
No.
- Excuse me.
- Give him the map.
Here you go, three bowls of porridge.
Three cinnamon buns and some salted meat.
Be careful, it's hot.
- Now, where were we?
- Espen.
My lord!
Get them! Get them now!
Come here!
Hey, where are you going?
Come out! I said, come out!
Stop it!
Ha-ha!
Here!
Now I got you!
- You stepped in the salad.
- No, Espen, you have.
No, you stepped in the salad.
Mommy!
Come on!
- I think we lost them.
- I hope so.
- Get them!
- Run!
- Have you ever hit something?
- I did hit the tree.
- Stop moving!
- Faster! Come!
What are we going to do now?
It's over. Even Gunnar won't miss from this distance.
Give me the map and maybe
I'll just beat you a little.
Do you remember the summer
when we jumped from the barn roof?
- When I broke the arm?
- Yes.
- No, just give him the map.
- I'm bored. Kill them!
No, no, no! I will give you the map.
I'll give you the map.
- Here.
- Bring it here.
- Now!
- No!
Come, Christian! Come!
Why didn't you take the money?
We could have gone home.
- But the princess...
- The princess is not our responsibility.
Do you really think
she wants to marry you?
No.
Now even prince Fredrik
is our enemy thanks to you .
- Yes, so what?
- "So what"?
They say one time he killed a bear
with his bare hands.
I heard it was two bears with
his hands tied on the back.
- Are you sure it wasn't three and that he was blindfolded too...
- Do you know what's wrong with you?
You don't understand that what you do affects other people.
When you don't do your chores
we have to work twice as hard.
We are struggling every day,
and you don't lift a finger.
Our family would have been much better -
- if you were not a part of it.
Calm down!
Stop it! Calm down!
Per, stop! Espen...
Give me the map.
Give it to me.
Give me the map!
Per, come on.
Please stop fighting.
He's like a child,
he's never growing up.
I found, I found.
- What did you find now?
- A old bearskin.
Are you going to drag that
flea skin over the mountain?
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
Do you understand now?
He saved us from the prince and the
hulder's, and he found the map...
Wait, wait!
I know we're supposed to get married,
according to the legend.
But I need a wedding dress.
Until then there won't be a wedding.
- Something is wrong with the map.
- What are we going to do now?
Let's just look for the pond.
Per?
Paul?
Why couldn't the sword be
in the "Busty Milkmaid Swamp"?
It's something there.
- Where is Espen?
- He was just behind us.
Reunited again, how nice.
Let's continue where we left off.
Where is the third one?
He's dead. He hit a rock when
we fell into the water. He's dead.
- I'm not talking to you.
- He's not talking to you.
Where is he? Where is he?
Per?
Paul?
I found it!
Do you think they will kill us?
Don't worry. They don't know
who they are dealing with.
- Just be ready.
- What do you mean?
Hey. You, yes.
I forgot to tell you something.
- What?
- Come here, I will whisper it to you.
Come here, then.
Paul, now!
Giddyup, giddyup! Ride!
You're dead.
If anyone has to take a leak, go now.
- Gunnar, do you need to take a leak?
- No, I'm good.
Will we have to stop in five minutes
because you have to take a leak?
- Yes, maybe.
- Well. Hurry up, then.
Bear! A bear!
There's a bear up there!
Do you want me to get the crossbow?
No. You never hit anything.
- You have killed a bear with your bare hands.
- That was another type of bear.
That is a very strange bear.
Bear...
You are either the bravest or the
stupidest guy I've met.
Map, please be so kind to show me
the way to the hall of the Mountain King.
Yes, your brothers have told us
a lot while you have been gone.
I don't know what's hiding inside
that mountain, but one thing I do know.
I will give you and your brothers the honor
of being the first to find out.
What about Kristin?
I'm going to marry her.
How many times do I have to tell you that?
But if she defies me again I will
gladly rule the kingdom alone.
Tragic hunting accidents have happened
before in the royal circuits.
Great rescue, dear brother.
You should have seen Per's attempt.
I've never seen anything like it.
It was something to write home about.
Why are we stopping now?
We know where we are going.
Because, thick headed friend, if the
myth about the Mountain King is true, -
- then trolls only hunt at night.
So we just wait for daylight and
when it's bedtime for little trolls.
Then we just walk right in...
Let us toast for the brave
and wise king Fredrik.
And 'gorgeous'.
You forgot 'gorgeous', but nevermind.
I'm so hungry now. I would have given
anything for some grilled duck right now.
Try not to look at it.
It will only make it worse.
Fredrik! You cannot expect us to
fight a troll on an empty stomach.
Fair enough.
You can have it if you can grab it.
Yes, go and grab it!
It's funny because they are tied to
a tree and it's impossible for them to reach it.
You're right, little-Jan.
That's why it's funny.
What do you think dad is doing right now?
Will we ever see him again?
I miss him.
Come on.
You won't fool me again.
I'm not stupid.
I'm smart.
All three of them is here.
Good point.
What do you think it is?
No! Run, run!
Come back! Come back!
We have to cut the rope.
The rock, Per. The rock!
Come on, Paul, stretch.
- One, two, three!
- Good!
- Espen!
- Come on!
Hurry, hurry!
Come on! Come on!
Espen! Espen, now!
The goose!
Paul!
Stay here! Protect me!
Christmas bonus for everyone!
Christmas bonus? What do you mean?
Oh no. Fire!
I hit the target!
Espen!
Come here!
Your hands.
Take mine.
- What's that smell?
- I have the goose.
- Are you insane?
- What?
- Your appetite will be our doom.
- I'm sorry.
It's almost like I can still smell it.
- Christian?
- I will not fail you, my lord.
- I thought that thing took you.
- No, I managed to shake it off.
You idiot, you have led it straight to me!
I just want to protect you.
- Christian...
- My lord?
You have been loyal and served me well over
the years, for that I want to thank you
and for this last act of bravery.
But ...?
It went well!
No, no, no!
Mommy!
- Do you think the troll have left?
- I don't know.
Paul! Paul!
All this...
is my fault.
I know I complain to you a lot.
You get carried away all the time daydreaming.
And you can't put a nail in the wall
without tearing down the house.
But you have something unique.
You see possibility when everyone
else believes it to be impossible.
The last couple of days I've
seen you fight with a prince.
Use a magic map.
I've seen you trick and defeat hulder's.
Paul needs us now.
And this is your world.
Out here I'm just as lost as you
are back home at the farm.
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.
No, no, no. No! No!
No!
I'm going to die here!
My love! Thank godness.
I thought I was going to die here.
- I'm here to rescue you.
- You're not doing a great job.
You have no idea what I've been through.
It's been a nightmare.
I thought you didn't like to get
your hands dirty.
I did it for you.
I will love you no matter what
you think of me.
Hah. He just wants the throne.
He will kill you after you're married.
Liar! This simple thief tried to rob
us when we were sleeping.
It was him who tried to rob us.
Do you think the princess will believe
a stranger over her fiance?
- Thank you.
- Who are you?
My name is Paul. Me and my brothers
Per and Espen went out -
-to find you because you
were taken by a troll
Did you say Espen?
Red hair, west, -
- irritating positive
with more gut than sense?
- Yes, it's probably him.
- Did he say anything about me?
Yes, that you are bad at riding.
- Did he say anything else?
- We haven't been able to talk that much.
Will he come and save us?
I found, I found.
Good.
- Look, fireflies.
- We don't have time.
Do you trust me?
There must be something we can use.
A glass jar.
Isn't it amazing what you can do
with an empty honey jar?
Age before beauty.
Watch your mouth.
Besides, you are the one with the sword.
The hall of the Mountain King.
- Is that Paul's shoe?
- Yes.
It looks like a labyrinth.
What are we going to do?
Let's use this so we can find
the way back.
You have your moments.
To search through all the
hallways can take years.
' Espen!
' Help!
Espen?
' I found, I found!
- Espen!
- Ready?
- Yes.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
Kristin...
Just wait until your father hears about this.
Nobody treats prince Fredrik this way.
Would you rather stay behind?
Thank you.
He is on his way back.
Hello, what's going on up there?
I can't hear you!
Don't hush me. Get me up!
Thank you. Finally.
Wait, stay here.
- The sun is rising. We are safe soon.
- Soon is not good enough.
We have to climb higher. The higher we climb,
the sooner the sun will shine upon us.
Up here!
Wait for me!
No!
He's right behind us!
Help!
Help! Help! Help!
Idiot.
Espen!
What are we going to do now?
This is my world.
Espen!
Espen!
Don't do it, Per!
Per!
Per! Per!
Per, wake up! Per!
Espen, you have to do something!
Distract him!
Hey, come and get me!
Don't you want me?
The sun.
Come on, come on...
I hate this forrest!
Hello again, old lady.
- Oh my, you are ugly.
- What do you want?
Do you know the way to the castle?
Well...
that way, down there.
Aha. Thank you.
Idiot.
Your Majesty...
For a messenger you are in a very bad shape.
Outside...
Mor! Far!
I want you to meet my friends.
Especially one of them. I'm here
thanks to Espen.
Yes, you are probably here for the reward.
What reward?
We made a promise that whoever found you would get...
To rule a kingdom is to much responsibility
for a simple farmer's boy like me.
All I'm asking for is enough money
to rebuild our farm.
Of course.
Excuse me, Your Majesty...
Is the possition as king and Kristin's
husband still available?
Because I would gladly...
- Paul...
- Nevermind.
There will be no wedding, not today
nor tomorrow.
Dear Kristin, you can marry whoever you want
to whenever you want.
And if I never will?
Hey, don't push it.
Kristin...
Group hug!
No, there will be no group hug.
Go and exercise.
Could a couple of wanderes ask for some porridge?
You're back.
Welcome home, son.
Welcome home.
- I'm so sorry.
- Me too.
Dad.
But...
- Did you find her?
- We didn't. It was Espen.
All we did was help.
Moren din ville vært stolt av deg,
Espen.
Call me "Ash Lad".
What I said when I was angry, I didn't mean it.
- You shouldn't carry that name.
- I've gotten used to it.
I think I will keep it.
Ash lad.
Good bye!
You are still bad at riding.
Do you want a ride or not?
Come...
Yes!
