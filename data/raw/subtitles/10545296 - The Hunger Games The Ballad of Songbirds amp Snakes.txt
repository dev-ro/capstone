There's some food
over here! Quick!
Come on!
Why is he doing that?
He's starving.
Your father is dead, Coriolanus.
It was a rebel, they say.
A trap out in the forest
in 12.
It's up to us now
to make him proud.
Tigris?
♪ Gem of Panem
♪ Mighty city
Tigris, where's the shirt?
♪ Through the ages
You shine anew
♪ We humbly kneel
To your ideal
♪ And pledge Our love to you ♪
That's beautiful, Grandma'am.
- Perhaps a little sharp today.
- Oh.
Have you seen Tigris with
my father's dress shirt?
No.
Coryo?
- Tigris?
- I'm sorry. I know I'm late.
But look, I did it.
Or, I did something.
I think it's really gorgeous.
It's beautiful.
Best cousin ever.
Tell me everything.
Where do I start? I
told Fabricia at work
that she needed to
bleach her white curtains
and I slipped the
shirt in when I did it.
The tesserae buttons
I made from...
From the bathroom tiles.
Brilliant.
Oh. Did you find the potatoes?
I boiled them for the starch
and you should really
eat something today.
Save them for Grandma'am.
You look so handsome.
Grandma'am! Come see!
Coriolanus Snow.
Future president of Panem.
We salute you.
Just a moment.
Wait, Grandma'am.
I can grow plenty
more. After today.
Got the grades,
never missed class.
Ten years.
Even Dean Highbottom
can't deny us this now.
Dean doesn't hate you.
He hates everyone.
He despises me.
What's the first thing you'll
spend the prize money on?
New dress?
Chocolate?
Chocolate!
It's the Plinth Prize, Tigris.
We'll be able to pay the rent.
Snow lands on top.
Why, Coriolanus Snow.
Clemmie.
Are you sweating?
It's Reaping Day.
We gave driver the morning off.
Ugh! That ingrate
should be begging
to chauffeur you around today.
Just don't forget. I
was your class partner
while you're gloating
over the Plinth Prize.
Prize? Please.
- I just want to serve Panem.
- Mmm.
Hungry?
Cook served steak for breakfast.
We had to throw half out.
Shame on you, Coryo.
Don't you know that they're
starving in the districts?
Good luck.
Not that you'll need it.
Hi.
Finally, the star pupil.
That's a snazzy shirt.
What are those
buttons, tesserae?
Huh.
That's why they remind me
of the maid's bathroom.
Have you tried this
lamb? It's scandalous.
Ugh. Only the vulgar eat
with their fingers, Felix.
What, Daddy not teach
you table manners?
Maybe he would have
if he wasn't so busy
running the country.
Hey, they called us here
for the Plinth Prize, right?
Because I heard Dr. Gaul's
in the building.
"Plinth."
I mean, look at his spawn.
Who would have
thought that you could
buy your way into the Capitol?
Well, you can't buy class.
Did you see his mother's outfit?
- Sorry, his "Ma's."
- Oh.
Dress a turnip in a ball gown,
and it'll still beg to be mashed.
Don't do that. We all
know that you like him.
I don't like him, Arachne.
I tolerate him.
He's district.
Tolerate him.
- Just don't encourage him.
- Okay. Sure.
I hear one more time
how immoral these
Hunger Games are,
I'll put him in the arena mys...
Sejanus.
You made it to the
Reaping for once.
And you made it to
graduation, Festus.
We're both shocked.
Spill it. Who won the prize?
Oh, no, I'm not gonna
ruin my father's big day.
No one here actually likes him,
but they do love his money.
You know what that's
like, don't you, Arachne?
Funny.
Hey, listen.
Um, I know you have
high hopes for this.
But there is no prize today.
Not anymore.
- I'm so sorry.
- What?
How tantalizing to see all
your shining young faces
on this auspicious day.
I am Dr. Volumnia Gaul,
your humble Head Gamemaker,
in charge of the War Department
and all its affiliated concerns.
I've broken free of
my laboratory today,
to examine you.
The leaders of the
next generation.
I won't be around
forever, after all.
And now to that end,
I am honored to introduce to you
the creator of the
Hunger Games themselves.
Dean Casca Highbottom.
Uh...
Select students,
faculty,
and, of course, Dr. Gaul,
I have summoned
you all here today
for the 10th annual
Reaping Ceremony
in which we choose two children
from each district
to throw into the Capitol Arena to
fight to the death in the Hunger Games.
I can't believe
they still allow him
to speak in public.
And here sit...
our own 24 top prospects
all waiting to hear the
results of hard study
in this prestigious institution.
Eager to learn who's won
that Plinth Prize, no doubt.
And a golden future.
However,
I am here to tell you
that there has been
a change this year.
One final assignment
to prove your worth.
Because...
the esteemed citizens
of the Capitol
have grown bored of the Games
and simply aren't
watching anymore.
And if the Games are to continue
at all, there must be an audience.
So, Head Gamemaker Dr. Gaul
has stepped in to...
incentivize patriotic values
with her own unique
flair, starting with you.
The Plinth Prize will
no longer be determined
by who has the best grades.
Excuse me?
But by who is the best
mentor in the Hunger Games.
This is a brand new role.
As the Reaping progresses live,
I will allocate each
district tribute
a Capitol mentor
behind the scenes,
one who must just persuade them
to perform for the cameras.
Obviously, the best
mentor will be the one
whose tribute wins the Games.
What if I get a
pathetic runt girl
from one of the poor
districts, like 8 or 12?
They're just gonna
die in two minutes
like they did last year
and the year before.
Your role is to
turn these children
into spectacles, Ms. Crane.
Not survivors.
Victory in the Games is only
one of our considerations.
Your entire future rests
on this last project.
Oh, and I must tell you
that anyone caught cheating
to give their tributes
an unfair advantage...
will just have
no future at all.
Oh! Here we go.
Let the Reaping ceremony begin.
District 1.
Boy goes to Livia Cardew.
Girl goes to Palmyra Monty.
District 2 boy...
How apt.
Boy goes to Sejanus Plinth.
You got the pick of the litter.
You forget. I'm
part of that litter.
4, boy,
Persephone Price.
Girl, Festus Creed.
7, boy, Vipsania Sickle.
Girl, Pup Harrington.
8, boy, Juno Phipps.
Girl, Hilarius Heavensbee.
10, boy,
Domitia Whimsiwick.
Mmm. Girl, Arachne Crane.
11, boy, Clemensia Dovecote.
11, girl, Felix Ravinstill.
12, boy,
Lysistrata Vickers.
Oh. You'll be happy
about this, Ms. Crane.
The "runt girl",
from District 12,
she belongs to Coriolanus Snow.
Lucy Gray Baird.
Sing your way out of
this one, Lucy Gray.
What is that dress?
Is she some sort of clown?
Lucy Gray.
I didn't know.
I didn't know. I'm sorry.
My daughter! Help her!
- Help her! Help her!
- Get it off! Get it off!
That's enough. Leave her be.
Just give me a minute, boys.
♪ You can't take my past
♪ You can't take my history
♪ You could take my pa
♪ But his name's a mystery
♪ Nothing you can take from me
♪ Was ever worth keepin'
♪ Nothing you can take
♪ Was ever worth keepin'
Singing?
Is she out of her mind?
♪ Can't take my charm
♪ Can't take my humor
♪ Can't take my wealth
Capitol says keep rolling.
♪ 'Cause it's just a rumor
♪ Nothing you can take
♪ Was ever worth keepin'
♪ You can't take my sass
♪ You can't take my talkin'
♪ You can kiss my ass! ♪
Come on, boys.
Well, she's mentally ill.
Proud, I see.
Like your father.
Yes. He and I
were best friends.
Once.
Enlighten me, Mr. Snow.
What are your plans
after these Games?
I hope to go on to
the University, sir.
Naturally.
And if you fail to win the
Plinth Prize, what then?
We'd pay the tuition, of course.
Look at you.
Your makeshift shirt
and your too tight shoes.
Trying desperately to fit in
when I know the Snows don't
have a pot to piss in.
Good luck with that
poor little songbird.
He's sabotaging us.
That girl's not gonna
win these Games.
You saw her. She's
underfed, unstable.
The Dean said it's not
just about winning.
Everything is about winning.
If not the Games
now, then the crowd.
Lucy Gray won't survive a
minute inside that arena.
So that means we have to make
every second before then count.
I'll get her to sing again.
I wouldn't sing a note
for you if I was her.
I wouldn't do anything at all.
Unless I could trust you.
She's district, Tigris.
She knows we hate her,
and she wants us dead.
How am I supposed to
get her to trust me?
Imagine it was your
name that they pulled
and you had been
ripped from your home.
I'd just wanna know that somebody
still cared about me out here.
Don't discount her just
because she's district, Coryo.
You might have more in common
with her than you think.
Transfer team, up front!
Get off the train!
Move.
Let's go.
Get out!
Come on out!
I said let's go!
No! No!
I will not...
Go! Keep moving!
- No!
- Come on.
No!
I said let's go!
I won't go. I won't. No.
Come on, get her outta there.
Welcome to the Capitol.
When I was little, my
mama used to bathe me
in buttermilk and rose petals.
Tastes like bedtime.
You look like you
shouldn't be here.
Well, I shouldn't.
But I'm your mentor.
A rebel.
What does my mentor do
besides bring me roses?
I do my best to
take care of you.
No!
On your feet.
Good luck with that, gorgeous.
Come on, let's go.
Move it.
Excuse me, can I...
Excuse me, I'd like to
escort my tribute...
Fall in.
In the truck. Hurry up.
Hey!
You, come on!
Come on.
Get in!
Hi.
What's the matter, pretty boy?
- You in the wrong cage?
- No.
This cage is delightful.
Get him, Reaper.
I will kill you right now.
He'll do it too.
Reaper killed a
Peacekeeper back in 11.
Quiet, Dill.
- I say we all kill him.
- I'm in.
Nothing left to lose now.
Y'all got family back home?
They'll kill them
if you hurt him.
Then you.
Besides, he's my mentor.
I might need him.
How come you get a mender?
Mentor.
You each get one.
Oh, and we'll just trust
you on that? Right?
I'm just here to help you.
Why does rainbow girl here
get special treatment, hmm?
Why aren't our menders here?
Just not inspired, I guess.
- All right, hold on!
- Get off me!
Oh! Ah!
Ouch. Well, we'll give them a chance
to stand up and catch their breath.
I'm jealous of that entrance.
I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman,
a man who needs no introduction.
You all know me as your
favorite weatherman
and amateur magician.
But guess where I am
today. Here's a hint.
That's right. The Capitol Zoo,
where this year's tributes
will be held here on display
behind these bars for
your viewing pleasure.
That's right.
All 24 of them 'cause...
What in the gem of Panem?
You see, that's the
Academy rouge, no?
Excuse me. Hello, sir.
Yes, you. In the red.
Who are you and why are
you in there with them?
We're live.
The Capitol is watching.
Own it.
Are you all right?
Sir? Who are you?
Lucy Gray Baird,
may I introduce you
to my neighbors?
A response would be
greatly appreciated,
but anything would be nice.
Hello?
Can they not hear me in there?
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.
They're holding hands.
Yes, yes, yes.
Who are you, sir? What are
you doing in the cage here?
Hi. How do you do?
My name is Coriolanus Snow.
And this is my tribute.
Lucy Gray Baird
from District 12.
Hi there.
- What's your name?
- My name is Pontius.
It's nice to meet you.
Is this your sister?
That's Venus. She's only four.
Well, I think four is
a very smart age to be.
Where'd you find that snake?
Well, he found me. Must
have been a music lover.
My singing calmed
him right down.
Can I touch your dress?
Of course.
I like your dress too.
- Oh. And who might you be?
- You don't know who I am?
Don't laugh.
Not everyone has televisions
out in the districts.
I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman.
But more enticingly,
who are you,
Lucy From District 12?
Oh. It's Lucy Gray.
And I'm not actually from 12.
No, my people are Covey.
We're like a family.
We're musicians by trade
and we travel from place to
place as the fancy takes us.
At least we used to. Before
the Peacekeepers rounded us up.
I see. But now
you're District 12.
- If you say so.
- Yes.
Your dress is far from gray
and it seems to be a big
hit with the children.
Oh, it is? Well, the Covey love
color, me more so than most.
But this dress was my mama's
so it's extra special to me.
Mmm-hmm. And she's
in District 12?
Well, only her bones, darling.
Only her pearly white bones.
Do you know my mentor?
Says his name is Coriolanus Snow
and clearly, I got the
cake with the cream
'cause nobody else has
even bothered to show up.
The Gamemakers did tell you
to jump in the cage with them?
They didn't tell me not to.
They just said that
it was a mentor's job
to introduce our tributes
to the citizens of Panem.
And I thought, well,
if Lucy Gray is brave
enough to be here,
- then why shouldn't I be, too?
- Hmm.
For the record, I
didn't have a choice.
For the record, I think you're
about to be whisked away, young man.
Let's go.
Oh. Hey...
Get us some food, please.
Jessup and I haven't
eaten since the Reaping.
The 10th annual Hunger
Games are soon approaching.
So come down to the zoo,
and see these tributes
before it's too late.
And I mean, too late.
For Capitol News,
I'm Lucretius...
"Lucky" Flickerman.
Your little excursion
was in violation
of about five different
Academy rules, Mr. Snow.
Chief amongst them,
endangering a Capitol student.
What? Who?
You.
I'm moving for the Gamemakers
to disqualify you as
mentor immediately.
You said we had to get
our tributes to perform,
not that we had to stay away.
I'll add
insubordination as well.
Holding her hand, Coryo,
introducing her to people,
you make it look as if
we're one and the
same as those animals.
Coriolanus didn't
show those people
anything they
didn't already know.
I don't need your help, Sejanus.
That the tributes
are human beings.
Just like us.
That's why nobody wants
to watch the Games.
It's because people
know deep down
that winning a war 10 years ago
doesn't justify starving
people's children,
taking away their
freedoms, their rights.
Snow fell down in the cage.
It fell down in the cage
but it landed...
On stage.
You're good at Games.
Maybe one day, you'll
be a Gamemaker like me.
If the Games continue at all.
Oh, they'll continue.
With performances like young
Mr. Snow's in that zoo.
And I came here to ask your
star mentor a question.
What are the Hunger Games for?
They're to punish the districts
for their uprising,
to commemorate the
end of the war...
"Commemorate the..."
Dull, dull, dull.
Punishment can
take myriad forms.
Why not drop bombs,
cancel food shipments,
stage executions?
Why Games?
Shouldn't we be asking ourselves
whether or not they're
right in the first place?
You have a problem
with my Games?
Some of those kids were two
years old when the war ended.
The oldest of them
were only eight.
The Capitol is supposed to
be everyone's government now.
It is supposed to
protect all of us.
I don't see how making children
fight each other to the death
is protecting anyone.
That sort of sympathy
might interfere
with your mentoring assignment.
Perhaps the Capitol students
are ill-suited to be
mentoring tributes.
Perhaps the Game's time
- has passed.
- Dean Highbottom is wrong.
My classmates, too.
Maybe Sejanus is
onto something here.
Maybe we should be viewing
those tributes as human beings.
I mean, you saw those kids
in the zoo, they just...
they just wanted to
get to know Lucy Gray.
If we need people to watch,
we should be letting
them get closer
to the tributes
before the Games.
To make the stakes personal.
Who will watch the
Games if they care
what happens to the tributes?
Everyone.
If they thought the
tribute they cared about
had a chance of winning.
People need someone to root for
and someone to root against.
We need them to invest.
And if we bend a
few Capitol laws,
we could even have
them place bets.
Look, I know Lucy Gray
may not win in the arena
but if you give her a chance,
I would bet the Plinth Prize
that she can win
people's attention.
I'd like you to
write up a proposal
of these thoughts
tonight, Mr. Snow.
Wait.
You mean you might
actually use his ideas?
If it'll help the
ratings, why not.
Coriolanus and I are
class partners, Dr. Gaul.
We do all of our
assignments together.
It'll be an interesting test.
You trying to fatten
that poor girl up
so you can finally
start taking bets?
You think they'll give
those kids a scrap
if we don't give them
a reason to do it?
How do you think your tribute will
have a chance if he can't eat?
He was my classmate.
Back in 2.
- It's not your fault it's him.
- See, I know.
I'm so blameless,
I'm choking on it.
My father bought him for me,
you know, at the Reaping,
Just so he could show me
that I could never go back to 2.
But being Capitol
is gonna kill me.
So do something about it.
Quite the rebel.
Oh, yeah.
I'm bad news.
Marcus. Hey.
It's me.
Marcus, look.
Here, I got some food for you.
Here.
Come on.
Marcus.
Is that for us?
Jessup.
I'm not hungry.
You think I can't hear your
stomach growling, Jessup Diggs?
Come on.
What happened to his neck?
A bat bite.
The first night on the train,
he didn't sleep a
wink the whole journey
'cause he was keeping
the bats off me,
so I would get some rest.
Can you take it?
Come on, try harder than that.
One thing I learned in 12
is that hunger is a weapon.
Your friend over
there sure knows it.
She is not my friend.
She is poison with
perfect teeth.
Are you gonna share everything
that I give you with Jessup?
Wh... Why?
You think I ought to build up my strength
so I can strangle him in the arena?
Not exactly my forte.
I might have a
chance to help you.
To make some suggestions
to the Gamemakers.
I might even be able to get the
audience to send you gifts in the arena.
Food and water to
keep you going.
You just have to
try singing again
to win people over.
I don't sing when I'm told.
I sing when I have
something to say.
Besides, I've seen your arena.
There's nowhere to hide.
What's the point?
The guards say you get money
if you get more people to watch
and you say you wanna
help me. Which is it?
Both.
One more time.
I'm not playing this game.
Come on.
You shut up.
- Uh... No, thank you.
- I saw you staring.
Please.
Give me something.
I've been sitting
here for 15 minutes!
Always thought there was
plenty of food in the Capitol.
You know, one time,
during the war,
I ate a whole jar of paste just
to stop the pain in my stomach.
And how was it?
Pasty.
That little one.
She's so sweet.
So young.
Something about her reminds
me of my cousin Maude Ivory.
I can't stand to think of
them without me like this.
I'm sorry.
You seem like a good
man, Coriolanus Snow.
Sure would've been
nice to meet you
under different circumstances.
- One of your shows, maybe.
- Yeah.
We could have had a drink.
A dance or two.
Like we had all the
time in the world.
Come on, just take it.
Help!
No, no, no!
It's okay. It's okay.
Hold on. Hold on.
Hey, look at me.
Hey, hold on. It's
okay. I'll get help.
Somebody help us, please!
Wha...
- Let's go.
- Oh, no.
It's starting again.
This is how it begins.
- The war.
- It was my fault.
I suggested we get
closer to the tributes.
You're just lucky
that your songbird
didn't peck out your eyes too.
She's not a rebel, Grandma'am.
She's just a girl.
Trust me, that one hasn't
been a girl in a long time.
Outside this Capitol,
they're savages,
one and all.
However, they may smile,
she will use you.
You must use her
or you'll end up dead in
the trees like your father.
This is for Dr. Gaul, please.
In spite of yesterday's
tragic events,
our president has decided
that the Games must go on
to show everyone the Capitol
is unafraid of such
acts of terror.
To which end, Dr. Gaul wishes
you to preview the arena
this afternoon
with your tributes.
Later this evening,
there will be a special
televised presentation
of each tribute to our
audience to, you know,
get to know them.
You will have an hour
to discuss strategy.
You may begin.
Marcus, come on.
You and I aren't
gonna be friends,
but I'm gonna win,
and for that to happen,
we need to make you more...
marketable.
I'm a really good climber.
I used to climb in my
mama's factory all the time.
It's getting infected.
I'm fine.
Look at me, Lamina.
I want you to win.
It's Reaper, right?
Um, let me read you what...
I'm so sorry about
your classmate.
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Wearing my mama's dress
is the only thing
keeping me together here.
It's like she's wrapping
her arms around me.
My mother, she used
to smell like roses.
She died in childbirth.
I was going to have
a little sister.
Both your parents gone?
So, you're an orphan.
Like me.
Look...
I need you to sing in
these interviews later.
It's the night before the Games
and your last chance
to win people over.
I can't send you
gifts in the arena
without their money.
Maybe a guitar could
persuade me. Maybe.
You really wanna take care of
me in that arena, Coriolanus?
Start by thinking
I can actually win.
Snow. Dovecote.
She can't expect
us to have written
that proposal last
night, can she?
I was crying for hours.
We did... write it.
I turned it in this morning.
All right, give me
the bullet points.
Mr. Snow.
Ms. Dovecote.
Come and see my new babies.
Is there a point to the color?
There's a point to
everything, Ms. Dovecote,
or to nothing at all.
Which brings me neatly
to your proposal.
Which one of you
actually wrote it?
- Well, there was...
- I was inspired
by Coriolanus
yesterday, of course.
His little betting idea.
But the sponsorships and
the gifts in the arena,
- those were all mine.
- Clemmie?
So it's your sweaty handwriting
on that page.
Very impressive, Ms. Dovecote.
Unfortunately, my
assistant mistook it
for trash this morning
and lined the shelf of this
very terrarium with it.
So, please, Ms. Dovecote,
retrieve it for us, won't you?
So we might all consider
your inspired ideas.
Don't worry,
my little predators
are perfectly docile
with those they can trust.
So if they're used
to your scent,
if you've handled their
food, for example,
or if they've inhaled
the sweat of your palm
on a page,
they'll leave you alone.
A new scent, however...
you'd be on your
own, little girl.
Retrieve it.
Clemmie.
Clemmie, no! No!
You asked about the
colors, Ms. Dovecote?
I want my enemies to see
a rainbow of destruction
engulfing the world.
I'm not above using spectacle
to create a little terror.
A strategy your classmate here
articulated very
well in his proposal.
They're good, your suggestions.
I'm going to recommend my team
implement as many as
possible tomorrow.
What?
Will she die?
The pleasure in breaking ground
in one's research is
one gets to find out.
You better keep Ms.
Dovecote's fate between us.
I don't think her mother
would be happy to learn
how she caught this sudden...
flu.
Now run along, you have
an arena to promote
and it's time for my
milk and crackers.
All right, let's go.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Come with me. Hey, you.
Get that camera on her. Coral.
Welcome to the arena
for the 10th annual
Hunger Games.
Tributes, mentors,
you have 15 minutes to survey
the space and discuss strategy.
Dill, you stick
by me, understand?
Hey, lumberjack.
Lamina.
No, no, just you.
Just you.
Jessup?
Jessup.
Please.
Coriolanus, please don't
let me die in here tomorrow.
Oh, shit!
Help me!
The gate's out!
The gate's out.
The gate's blown open.
Come on, the gate's open.
Come on. He wouldn't save you.
We've got runners!
Coryo.
Lucy Gray?
- Is she...
- She's alive.
What happened?
It was a rebel bombing.
They must have been
planning it for months.
Four tributes were killed.
Everyone's terrified, Coryo.
People are locking themselves
inside their houses.
Felix Ravinstill's
on life support.
The rebels released a message.
They said they wanted to tear down the
symbol of the Hunger Games on live TV.
...savagely and
cowardly attacked us...
Marcus got out.
gravely injuring
the president's...
He's the only one.
Peacekeepers are hunting
him in the streets but
at least he has a
better chance out there
- than he would tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?
They're not still going
ahead with the Games?
Oh, no, Lucy Gray.
Lucy Gray could've run.
- The show will go on.
- But she saved me.
And now our final tribute.
I first met this
young lady in the zoo
not too long ago.
- From District 12...
- Coryo.
Lucy Gray Baird.
Come out here with that
guitar, you songbird.
Good evening,
Capitol. Districts.
I wrote this song
about a boy back in 12,
and I hope he hears it.
♪ When I was a babe I
fell down in the holler
♪ When I was a girl
I fell into your arms
♪ We fell on hard times and
we lost our bright color
♪ You went to the dogs
and I lived by my charms
♪ It's sooner than later
that I'm six feet under
♪ It's sooner than later
that you'll be alone
♪ So who will you turn to
♪ Tomorrow, I wonder
♪ For when the bell rings
Lover, you're on your own
♪ I am the one who you
let see you weeping
♪ I know the soul that
you struggle to save
♪ Too bad I'm the bet that
you lost in the Reaping
♪ Now what will you do
♪ When I go to my grave ♪
Ding, ding, ding.
Look at that.
Record high for the evening.
The Capitol is
definitely watching.
People sending in
donations. See what happens
- when you do stuff?
- Yeah.
Now, I don't love your odds,
but may they be in your favor.
Thank you for being here.
Ms. Lucy Gray, District 12.
Both of you.
It's what friends do.
How wonderful is this night
that we all get to be here for
someone's final performance.
Ms. Lucy Gray, thank you.
Go home, go to bed, get
a good night's sleep.
You've got a big day tomorrow.
Lucy Gray.
Lucy Gray.
- Hey.
- You're alive.
Those bombs, they have
changed everything.
They blew the walls out.
So that means you can
escape up into the stands.
There's a hole
down in the floor.
Leads down to some
tunnels. I've tried it
and you can
disappear down there.
So the moment you hear that bell ring,
you ignore the weapons in the middle
and you run as fast as
you can for that hole.
And you find a place to
hide down below. Alone.
- Alone? No.
- Yeah.
- Jessup's my friend.
- No.
The moment that bell rings,
you can't trust anyone.
Not even Jessup.
Just lay low down there
until it's safe to come out.
Thank you for taking care of me.
I can't let you die.
You saved me.
You saved me, Lucy Gray.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.
I'm more hopeful
during the daytime,
but when it gets dark, I just...
It's okay.
It's okay.
I am gonna get you out of here.
I promise.
Back to the Covey, okay?
Is this real?
Just tell me.
If I'm gonna risk
everything. That song...
That song was
payback, that's all.
My old boyfriend, Billy Taupe,
he was cheating on me
with the mayor's daughter.
- The girl from the Reaping.
- Yeah, she got crazy jealous.
She had her pa read my
name up on that stage
and now everyone will
know what they did to me.
Here.
You take this.
- No, no, it's too fine.
- No, it is not a gift.
It's a loan.
What's in here, don't touch it.
Don't even breathe it in
because small amounts
can be deadly.
Look, I have seen what
war does to people, okay?
I've seen it.
And there will come a
time when you need this.
When you need to act.
We all do things we're
not proud of to survive.
Hey.
We are gonna win
this, Lucy Gray.
We're gonna win this together.
Wake up! On your feet!
Jessup.
That friend of yours. Plinth.
You might wanna find him
a seat near the door.
Coryo.
-Hey.
-How you doing? You all right?
- Better.
- Over here, please.
Better.
Tell me this will
be over quickly.
What is this? The mines?
I... I gotta get my
tools. Pa said...
Here we go. Here
we go, everyone.
Come on. Come on, let's go.
Sit down, Festus, come on.
Everyone, as you know,
we're about to go live.
Just because you're not hosting,
doesn't mean you're
off the hook. Help me.
Don't get lost
behind your screens.
No yawning, no gum chewing.
Keep your chins down,
heads up, shoulders back.
And smile.
It's why we have teeth.
Okay. Ready? We're
gonna start, guys.
Five, four,
three, two...
Good morning, I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman.
A man who needs no introduction.
Weatherman, amateur magician,
and today,
I'm honored to say...
first ever host of
the Hunger Games.
In my hand, an envelope, sealed.
My prediction, the
winner to be opened by me
upon the big show's end.
Well, well...
They're here. We're
getting word...
All right, we're about to start.
We're starting,
everyone, we're starting.
Happy Hunger Games.
Happy Hunger...
Remember, when your tribute
dies, get out of here.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Enjoy the show.
Stand on your mark
or you will be shot.
Move.
Ooh! Marcus.
Guess we can all sleep better
now knowing he's off the streets.
You're monsters!
All of you!
Ten, nine...
... eight, seven, six,
- five...
- Jessup.
four,
- three...
- Jessup.
two,
one.
Run.
Jessup!
Jessup!
What are you doing? Run.
Jess...
Jessup!
Jessup!
Jessup!
Jessup! Jessup, we
gotta go, come on.
We should get out of here.
We gotta go. We gotta go.
They've gone underground
very quickly,
but we're prepared for this.
- Go, go, go.
- What you're seeing now
is a live feed of
security cameras.
Come on!
Come on!
Go, go, go.
This way.
Hy and Sol from
the other side,
pincering in on Lucy Gray.
Come on.
No! Please, no!
No!
Here comes the Pack,
surprising Hy and Sol.
No!
Come on.
Hey, lumberjack, get in
there and get her out.
I'm not sticking
my head in there.
She could be waiting
with a brick.
I knew we should have
recruited that Reaper kid.
Do you think they're done?
Looks like it.
To the children watching,
that was violent,
horrific, and disgusting.
Ms. Phipps,
please, if you're going to
vomit, do it off camera.
Thirteen tributes remain.
Reaper still looming
large on top of the charts
while Coral and her
Pack try to make a play.
Six tributes gone in minutes.
If they keep it up at this pace,
we're gonna be outta
here in no time.
Now, these record
high temperatures
aren't doing that
fire that continues
to burn out here in
District 9 any favors.
I'll keep an eye on it.
In District 10,
this warm front is gonna
come down and collide here,
squeezing out some drizzle.
And finally, in
District 12, a...
Lamina.
Please.
Please.
Yes!
Cold pressure system's
gonna swoop on in,
bringing cooler temperatures
and some much needed relief
to our coal miners out there,
at least until early evening.
That's the weather.
Was it mercy? Was it murder?
Either way, that's what
happens when you do stuff.
You get attention.
Citizens send you money.
Now, once they get your money,
the mentor can choose
to send in food or water
using our newly developed
drones from the war,
reprogrammed with
facial recognition.
This ensures that your package
goes directly to your tribute.
Isn't that right,
Pup Harrington?
Yeah.
I've got a hunch Pup is
gonna seize the opportunity.
What?
Uh, we have a reservation
tonight. Flickerman.
Party of two and a high chair.
We will not be there,
um, on time. I'm sorry.
I'm... I'm hosting
the Hunger Games...
10th annual,
and it's going a little bit
longer than anticipated,
so I'm curious to know
if you have anything
later tonight.
You do. Great.
I will be there.
Because this...
If not... If you don't
see me, I'm not there.
You can't save
her by watching.
What do you want from that girl?
- Nothing. I want her to live.
- Mmm.
And the Plinth Prize would
be a happy coincidence,
I suppose.
I believe I'd be entitled to it.
Of course you do.
Of course you do.
The prize, the girl.
Hmm, how convenient. You don't
have to choose between them.
Who do you think makes
that final decision
for the prize you
so covet, Mr. Snow?
Wake up.
Even if Lucy Gray Baird
somehow wins it all,
I will do everything in
my power to ensure that
you don't see a dime.
So, ask yourself,
how much do you care
if she lives now?
We gotta be quiet
down here, Jessup.
I just wanna sleep.
You want some water?
What have you done to it?
I didn't do anything,
Jessup, I just...
Are you okay?
It's okay.
Jessup, come on.
Let's go back to sleep, okay?
I know, I know. It's
okay. It's okay.
Mr. Snow.
What happened?
Is it Lucy Gray?
Unless you can put a leash
on your deluded classmate,
she might as well be dead
as far as you're concerned.
Sejanus?
Bread crumbs. I believe
sustenance for a fallen comrade
on his final journey.
A District 2 superstition.
I'll work on finding the
Peacekeeper he bribed
to get him in, and
cut out their tongue.
In the meantime,
I need someone to get
him out right now.
You should send Peacekeepers in.
Only to have him bolt
and hide like a rabbit?
Felix Ravinstill is
fighting for his life
in the hospital, Mr. Snow.
I will not have these rebels
make a further mockery
of my Games.
Anyone sees us lose
control of this arena,
it might as well be sounding
a horn to the districts
to revolt.
You choose to be friends
with this radical.
You want him to end
the Games tonight?
It'll look a lot worse if
the tributes kill two of us.
So don't let them.
Who knows? You get
him out unscathed,
I'll whisper your name
in his father's ear.
You still want that
Plinth Prize, don't you?
I'll freeze the
feed for an hour.
I estimate that's all we
have until the people notice.
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Enjoy the show.
I thought they'd send my ma.
Yeah, I wish they had.
You need to go, Coryo.
I'd like to. I really would.
But I promised I'd get you out.
Why?
Because you're my friend.
I have to do this. I had to
go where the cameras are.
You think anyone's
watching this?
Gaul cut the feed.
Tributes kill you in here, she's
just gonna say you died of the flu.
You need to decide right now.
Do you wanna fight
these tributes,
or fight for them?
Because if you wanna
make real change,
you need to stay alive to do it.
How can I make any
change from out there?
You're rich.
Smart. You care.
You're the only one
who stood up to Gaul
in that class, right?
We're dead if we
don't leave right now.
Come with me.
Spend your father's
money, do some real good.
Or just be another dead
body in Gaul's war.
Please.
Trust me.
I...
Go! Go!
Run!
Come on, get up! To the gate!
I don't wanna hurt you!
Enjoy the show.
Come on, get up.
- Go!
- Move it!
Open the gate! Open the gate!
Watch those screens, gorgeous.
'Cause I may have
missed you tonight,
but your songbird's
next on my list.
Let's go.
I'm... I'm sorry.
Coryo, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
For all of it.
My father.
Let the buying begin.
Ma!
I had to do something.
Snow stormed down,
down on his head.
It stormed down on his head,
and now the boy is...
You've had enough of the
Games tonight, I see.
Come, sit.
I'll stitch you up.
Who could imagine
Crassus Snow's baby boy
fighting for his life
in the arena one day?
What happened in there,
that's humanity undressed.
Fueled with the terror
of becoming prey,
see how quickly we
become predator.
See how quickly
civilization disappears.
Those tributes
don't have a choice.
I was talking about you.
All your fine manners,
education, background,
stripped away in
the blink of an eye,
leaving a boy with a club who
beats another boy to death
to stay alive.
You wanna protect
people, Mr. Snow?
To govern them like your father?
Then it's essential you
accept what human beings are
and what it takes
to control them.
They sent me into the
arena tonight, Tigris.
What?
To get Sejanus out.
What happened? Are you okay?
I killed one of the tributes.
A boy.
It must have been awful.
It was.
Then it felt...
powerful.
Coryo.
I know you wanna
be like your father
but what I remember
the most about him
was that in his eyes,
it was just hate.
You don't have to
pay the same price
just to survive.
People can be good.
You can be good. You are good.
Just believe in that.
Wakey wakey, my
Capitol friends.
I'm Lucky Flickerman and
welcome to day number two
of the 10th annual Hunger Games.
Now, while most of you were getting
your beauty sleep last night,
something
scintillating occurred.
Bobbin from District 8,
slaughtered.
Which of these beasts slayed
Bobbin from District 8?
Either way, it doesn't matter.
10 tributes remain.
Reaper still at the
top of the boards.
They aren't showing us
what happened to
that little boy.
He clearly was
killed right there.
There's cameras everywhere.
It doesn't make sense.
They said they were
old cameras, Lyssie.
Probably just another
one of Coral's.
Festus, sit down.
Same seats.
- What'd you do to me?
- Nothing!
Lyssie, what is he doing?
Something's wrong. He wouldn't
turn on her like this.
Jessup going after Lucy Gray.
Go to the stands,
go to the stands.
Stop running! What did you...
- What did you do to me?
- I didn't do anything.
Both tributes
from District 12.
The same district
folding in on itself.
Wait, look.
The foam.
I didn't do anything to you!
I think it's rabies.
That bite. From that train.
Send him water.
Wait, what?
You remember the
posters in the war?
Rabies. It makes you afraid
of water. Send him a drone.
- That'll scare him.
- Yes.
Away from her.
Jessup is done.
Lyssie, you're the only one
that can get it right to him.
Ms. Vickers going for
her communipad early.
Thank you.
Sending a drone.
Nothing to be proud of.
Please, please, please!
What's wrong with me?
What did you do to me?
Oh!
Jessup?
I'm not going anywhere.
Okay?
You watched over me, now
I'm watching over you.
Sleep now, Jessup, sleep.
Okay.
Here we go.
Oh, no!
Lucy Gray.
You stay right there.
Oh, look at this.
The Pack doing what they
do best. Packing it in.
Lucy Gray is swarmed, cornered.
Mizzen, propellering his net.
Mr. Snow going for
his communipad.
Hey, Coral, do you mind
if I take this one?
Not a chance.
These drones are not very good.
Hey! You can't
attack the tributes.
I'm just sending water.
You idiots.
- How did you possibly let her get away?
- I couldn't see a thing.
Get this water into
a pile, lumberjack.
And then when you're done,
you two can watch that beam
while we get your little friend
from back home up there at least.
Now.
Do it now.
Again, a fall...
ending a tribute's game.
Wake up.
Lucy Gray on the move.
And so is Pup Harrington.
Thank you, Pup.
You're useless.
Now, I wish we had a
camera inside of the duct,
but we don't.
But we will next year.
Hey.
You really think you deserve
that water now, Tanner?
Look, you just said
watch the beam.
Coral.
It's Wovey.
The little one from 8.
This should be easy.
Seven tributes remain.
Merciless Mizzen, Cunning Coral,
Treacherous Treech,
Dill, Reaper, of course,
and the lone wolves,
little Wovey and Lucy Gray.
And who do we have here?
Ah! It's ill Dill.
Tuberculosis on legs.
Dill?
Dill?
Dill, wake up.
Dill.
No.
What happened?
Dill?
Dill?
Hey.
Dill, hey, wake up.
Dill.
Dill!
I'm so sorry.
He just tore down the flag.
Are you gonna punish me now?
Are you going to punish me n...
Capitol citizens,
I'm afraid I must
interrupt our Games
to announce a tragic loss,
one that affects us all.
Felix Ravinstill, son of
our beloved president...
Has, this morning,
succumbed to his injuries
sustained in the rebel bombing.
Out there in the districts,
they will be celebrating
this young boy's death
as a triumph.
I will not allow my Games
to give our enemy
such a victory.
I swear to you, here and now,
before the sun
goes down tonight,
a rainbow of destruction
will engulf our arena.
Even if it means there's to
be no victor in these Games.
Get me a drink. Get
me a drink right now.
I need to see
Dr. Gaul immediately.
Hey. Go get a
spear. Go up there.
Push her back as much
as possible. Trust me.
Come to beg for her life?
No.
No, my stitches,
they broke loose.
I didn't want the
doctors asking questions.
Come, sit.
Pull down your shirt.
Shh. Quiet.
She's up here somewhere.
This might hurt.
Jabberjays we call them.
We sent them out during the war
to pick up rebel conversations,
squawk it back to
us word for word.
Watch.
A failed experiment,
but an instructive one.
I'm rounding them up
district by district now
to see what better
purposes they might serve.
A failed experiment,
but an instructive one.
Here, birdy, birdy, birdy.
Don't be scared.
Don't run away.
Lucy.
I'll see you in the auditorium
for the finale, Mr. Snow.
You should be proud of yourself.
Your songbird, Lucy Gray,
put on a wonderful show.
Shh. Quiet, quiet. Listen.
Coral.
Lucy Gray, is she okay?
She won't be for long.
I've got you now, songbird.
Wait.
What's wrong with Treech?
Did Coral do
something to Treech?
Run. Run.
What did she do to him?
Dissension in the
ranks. Treech is down.
Good afternoon, Ms. Sickle.
That is not gonna be good.
Work, please.
Wouldn't it be fun
if it was candy?
Is it over?
- Can we go home now?
- Wovey.
- Wovey.
- Please!
Wovey.
Wovey.
Not candy! Down goes Wovey.
Help!
Mizzen,
- say goodbye!
- Yes!
Lucy Gray, wait!
Lucy, I'm begging you!
It's not fair.
It's not.
I can't have killed
them all for nothing.
And that is good-bye
to Festus Creed.
Have a nice summer.
Now, all colors lead to Gray.
She's... She's won.
It's over, she's won.
She's won, let her out.
Afraid that's not your
call to make, Mr. Snow.

Who will watch the Games

Get her out! Get her out!
Get her out.
She's won! Lucy Gray!
Coriolanus Snow is the winner
of the 10th Annual Hunger Games.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Congrats!
Congrats!
Whoo!
The Games...
that I had...
predicted! Whoo!
- Yeah! Give it up!
- Tigris.
Snow! Snow! Snow!
Snow! Snow! Snow!
Snow! Snow! Snow!
Lucy Gray?
Lucy Gray?
I warned you, Mr. Snow.
Cheating will be punished.
More poetically than
even I could have hoped.
Lucy Gray, where is she?
I would be more concerned
with your own survival
if I were you.
It's fitting that
both your parents
could be here for
your big moment.
That compact.
How many times did I see
your mother use it, I wonder...
to powder her beautiful face?
Come now,
we both know that child from 11
didn't die of disease.
Or that lumberjack from 7.
And that old handkerchief,
we found it in the snake
tank, appropriately...
condemning you with your
father's own initials.
Your family won't ever see
that prize money now of course.
President Ravinstill has left
your form of punishment to me,
and I've decided
banishment to the districts
where you'll serve your Capitol
in exile for the next 20 years
as an anonymous,
peacekeeping grunt.
Do you hear that, boy?
Finally.
The sound of snow falling.
8.
Send me to 12.
Please.
You know, I thought
I might find you here
sitting all by yourself.
Sejanus, what are you
doing... What do you think?
After what I did in the arena,
my father had to buy the
Academy a brand-new gym
just so I could get my diploma.
He begged me to stay.
But once I found out where
they were sending you,
I couldn't get
out fast enough.
Barely made the train
because of this stupid knee.
But it's okay.
They gave me some
morphling for the pain.
You volunteered for this?
I figure I get through basic
and then maybe I become a medic.
Make a real difference out here.
Just like you said.
They never told us what you did.
I cheated.
To save Lucy Gray
from the snakes.
Do you think they killed her?
Why would they risk it?
She was a big hit.
If there is a Games next year,
they're probably
gonna invite her
to sing at the opening ceremony.
You know, when you came in,
I was weighing the
merits of suicide.
When we're about to be free?
When the girl you
risked everything for
might be waiting for you
at the end of this track?
My friend, don't give
them the satisfaction.
Your life has just begun.
You're gonna do great.
We're both gonna do great.
Just be careful.
Okay?
It's a different world out here.
Move it out!
Welcome to 12.
We're proud to have
every one of you
serving your country out here.
For the next 20 years,
brothers and sisters
in your immediate squad
will become your family.
You will train together,
sleep together, eat together.
You will rise together and
you will fall together.
You will be our eyes and ears
out here on my base
as well as off it.
And it will be your duty
to report anything
suspicious you see,
because if you do not,
you are as good as
a rebel yourself.
Last month, a Peacekeeper
and two mine bosses
were shot dead in the pits.
We retrieved the murder weapon.
We swabbed it for DNA.
And the results proved
beyond doubt that this man,
Arlo Chance...
is guilty.
So, watch, all of you.
This is what happens
when you challenge the
Capitol's rule of law.
- He's innocent!
- No, no, no!
No, no, no!
- He's innocent!
- Lil, Lil, Lil!
- No, Lil!
- He's innocent!
Run, Lil, run!
Run, Lil! Run, Lil!
- No, no, no!
- Arlo!
- No! No!
- No, no, no!
- No! Arlo!
- No, no, no!
Run, Lil! You're murderers!
No! No!
Run, Lil, run!
You're murderers!
Run, Lil, run!
Run, Lil, run!
He didn't do it!
You're all murderers!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Arlo!
What were you
thinking back there?
She didn't do anything,
Coryo. What is she guilty of?
Being directly
associated with rebels.
What more do they need?
If she had gotten
through the crowd...
He didn't do it! I
swear he didn't do it!
I don't think I would have
been able to shoot her.
Would you?
He didn't do anything!
You need to find a way to make
peace with our life here now.
Or have your father buy you a
discharge and do something else.
Hey.
Hoff's given us all leave
passes for the weekend.
Boost morale.
Boost morale.
Please.
Please help.
Hey, uh, I'm gonna
go get a drink.
Is it hot in here?
Yeah!
'Cause we're plannin' on
heating it up a set more.
The one, the only,
Lucy Gray Baird!
Well, hey there, District
12, did you miss me?
Yeah!
I bet you never expected
to lay eyes on me again.
And, let me tell you,
that goes both ways.
But I am back.
I sure am back!
Oh! Is that bottle there for me?
Oh, come on, y'all.
You know, I gave up
drinking when I was 12.
It's to clear my pipes,
y'all. To clear my pipes.
Now, how about a song, huh?
Yeah!

Lucy Gray!

- Billy Taupe!
You're sounding kind
of thin, Lucy Gray.
Billy! Billy!
You're all sounding
thin without me. No?
- Billy!
- I've got it.
Billy!
Billy!
You swore you wouldn't play
with them again, Billy Taupe.
Come on.
Settle down, settle down.
I know you miss me, Lucy Gray.
Get your hands off me right now.
Get your hands off me, Billy.
Get your hands off
me, Billy Taupe.
After what you did to me,
you get your hands
off me right now.
Or I swear I will take
a snake and I will...
Don't touch her!
Coryo, stop!
- Get off me, get off me!
- What are you, crazy?
Come on. We gotta
get out of here.
Who'd have thought
I'd have to save you?
She's here.
She's alive.

They said I might

Sorry, I...
I still got one
foot in the arena.
Your hair,
that uniform...
I thought you were dead.
Yeah, I thought I was too.
But your dean, Highbottom,
he had them send me home.
Highbottom did?
Put me on a train himself,
gave me some money.
He said they'd sent you to 8.
For breaking their rules.
Saving your life.
But I gave them my last cent
so that I could come here to 12.
Because I had to
try to find you.
Your dean, he...
he told me the
strangest thing. He...
He said he was glad
that I survived you.
He told you what I did
to that boy in the arena?
I didn't have a choice.
- That little girl, Dill...
- I know.
I thought it'd be
one of the others...
- maybe Coral...
- Hey.
You are not a killer, Lucy Gray.
Yes, I am.
Both of us are now.
You're safe.
Your Peacekeeper friends.
I'll handle this.
They'll be here about
the fight last night.
Hey, they can't see us together.
There's a lake out in the woods.
Nobody knows much of
it except us Covey.
Meet me here tomorrow, we'll go.
We can be free out there.
Maude Ivory, you got my guitar?
- Yeah.
- Thanks, honey.
I can put something together.
- All right.
- Yeah.
Your boy is coming.
See you later.
Hey, you're back.
How's Lucy Gray?
Figured you'd be a while, so
I decided to explore town.
Oh.
With Billy Taupe?
And who's the
other guy with him?
I remember that
from the Academy.
Watching you watch everyone.
Carefully choosing
when to weigh in.
Are you trying to
help these people?
Don't you think they need help?
They lost the war, Sejanus.
A war they started that
made your family rich.
I am not about to throw away
any chance I might have
of getting home someday
just because you
feel a bit guilty.

Does she survive?
Lucy Gray, in the
song? The footprints?
Maybe she flew away.
I'm sure she's out
there somewhere.
She's a survivor.
But it's a mystery, sweetheart.
Just like me.
I brought you something.
It was my mother's.
I'd like for you to have it.
Mmm.
It still smells like roses.
Thank you.
I'll take good care
of it, I promise.
You must miss your
family so much out here.
I do.
I worry about them all the time.
Would you really
go back, though?
If you could?
To the Capitol?
I have to.
It's where I belong.
But I hope you'll
come back with me.
Capitol's not for me.
At least it's
civilized. Has order.
The Hunger Games are order?
No.
No, of course not.
What if this was our
life, Coriolanus?
Out here.
Waking up whenever.
Catching our own food,
living out by a lake.
I mean, would you still feel a
need for the Capitol even then?
Uh...
- Did you two just pick this?
- Yep.
Thank you.
Well, it's a little
early yet, Maude Ivory.
- No.
- No.
Early for what?
To eat the roots.
Pretty little thing,
but it's determined.
Some people call
it "swamp potato."
But I think "katniss" has a
much nicer ring, don't you?
Hey, grab the rods, CC?
We could use some
more fish at home.
He misses Billy Taupe.
Do you?
Not since the Reaping, no.
I can't trust him anymore.
Trust is everything.
It's everything to me.
More important even than love.
Without trust, you might
as well be dead to me.
You can trust me.
I promise you that.
If you can trust
anyone in this world,
you can trust me.
You can trust me too.
Private Snow?
Come with us.
Snow.
I received the results
from your aptitude
tests this morning.
Looked over your
training records too.
Your performance is exemplary.
Well, half the other
recruits can't read, sir.
You're General
Crassus Snow's boy.
What did you do to end up here?
I made an enemy, sir.
In the Capitol.
I've made a career out of
ruining my enemies' plans.
I'm gonna reassign you
to officer training
in District 2.
You'll earn a real wage.
Maybe even have another
shot at the Capitol one day.
Train leaves in 10 days.
Keep a clean record,
you'll never see anyone
from District 12 again.
Is there a problem?
This is an honor,
Private. Not an option.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Coryo?
- Tigris?
Coryo!
Tigris.
Your curls!
Yeah, I know.
Where are you?
Coryo, we're fine.
Tigris, where are you?
We had to move out.
We're renting this place
just for right now.
They evicted you?
Listen. I'm fine.
Grandma'am is fine.
I really don't want
you to worry, okay?
I think I found a
way out of here.
I just have to make it
through Officer Training in 2.
And then I can make my
way back to the Capitol.
- I will fix this.
- Okay.
I'm gonna be home soon.
I promise.
Don't make me hope.
Secure! Good to go!
Whatever it is you're
doing, you need to stop it.
- What are you...
- Don't.
I saw you talking to
that woman in the jail.
If I don't report you now...
You don't know
anything to report.
They know we're
friends, Sejanus.
You're gonna get us both killed.
You told me I
could do something.
You told me I could
make a difference.
There's a group of
locals that are getting
- out of District 12 for good.
- Don't. Stop talking.
- I can't hear this.
- Listen to me.
They're going up north
to start a new life
far away from Panem.
They need money for supplies.
They told me I could go
if I got it for them.
You could come with us.
You're giving money
to the locals.
Are you out of your
mind? They're all rebels.
I can't stay here. I won't.
They're not planning on doing
anything dangerous, okay?
It's all dangerous.
They're just doing what
anybody else would do, Coryo.
The leader, Spruce, he wants
to get his sister, Lil,
out of jail on base.
Hoff is going to execute her
just because she knows
the man that they killed.
It's wrong.
I'm gonna help them get her out.
- It's treason, Sejanus.
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.
I'm just doing what you
told me to do at the arena.
I was just trying to save you
the first time you did
something stupid enough
to ruin my life.
What if they catch you
bringing this woman off base?
It's worth the risk
to do the right thing.
For you.
Your father will just
buy your way out of it
like he always does,
while I'll be hung
just for knowing you.
Please.
Don't make me rescue you again.
I don't need you to
rescue me, Coryo.
They're just doing
what anybody else
would do, Coryo.
The leader, Spruce,
he wants to get his
sister, Lil, out of jail...

These are supplies.
What, did you think
this was a game?
You said that nobody
was gonna get hurt.
- That isn't part of the deal.
- Hey.
Hey, stop!
What are you doing?
Guns, Sejanus?
I didn't know there was gonna be
weapons, Coryo. They lied to me.
You thought they'd be honest?
Are you crazy? There are
Peacekeepers right out there.
There's another one
in here now, too.
Okay, wait.
And the mayor's daughter?
Hey, it's okay,
Spruce. He's with me.
I told him to come in
here. He's gonna help.
- Hey, where'd...
- Wait, wait, wait.
You invite the
whole town, Plinth?
She's okay, Spruce.
She's joining us
too. She's with me.
She what?
Quiet down, Mayfair.
I'll explain later.
I think I'm done listening
to your explanations.
She's not going anywhere.
And neither are you.
My pa's gonna string
y'all up for this.
Stop!
She'll tell everyone, you idiot.
- She'll get us all hung.
- He's right.
No, she won't, Spruce.
She's all talk, no action.
What do you think, Lucy Gray?
Am I all talk, no action?
Hey, how'd you enjoy
the Capitol, by the way?
See y'all at the Hanging Tree.
No, no!
Wait.
Mayfair!
♪ Keep on the sunny
side of life... ♪
Coriolanus, what
did you just do?
Well, you just shot the
mayor's daughter, son.
What did you just do?
If you weren't a rebel
before, you are now.
- You killed her.
- Quiet, Billy Taupe.
You're all right.
You and me, we're
gonna be all right.
No one is gonna
think this was us.
You reckon you're just
gonna walk out of here free?
- Dump this on me, maybe?
- I said, pipe down.
You got a surprise
coming, Capitol boy.
If I'm gonna swing for
this, you swing with me.
Oh!
- I didn't trust him anyway.
- Billy Taupe!
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.
You're gonna go back out on that
stage and you're gonna sing.
You're gonna sing
like nothing is wrong.
And I'm gonna find us a
way out of this, okay?
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay? I swear. I swear.
Go. Go.
Get rid of these guns. Go.
Go, Spruce, go.
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.
- For once, shut up.
- It's all my fault!
All of this is your fault.
It's only gonna get worse if you
don't pull yourself together.
If you breathe a word now,
both of us, we're finished.
So we go back out there
and we act like
nothing is wrong.
- I don't know...
- Hey.
Hey, look at me.
You have to pull yourself together.
You have to pull it together.
You came here for me, right?
We're brothers?
Brothers.
So whatever you've done, I
swear I will keep you safe.
Those guns were the only loose
end besides the four of us.
So we're gonna be okay.
Okay? Not a word.
- Okay.
- Okay?
- Hey, Beanie.
- Yeah?
Who's that girl you
were dancing with, man?
I think her name was Josie.
Come on, everybody,
up! Everybody up!
- Let's go!
- Smiley, what's going on?
Hoff is losing his mind.
The mayor's daughter got
shot, and her boyfriend, too.
He's sending out
every grunt we've got,
to find the guns that did it.
It is our duty to keep
peace in this district.
So these murderers shall
be brought to justice.
We shall find their
murder weapons.
If the killers are
still in Panem's grasp,
they will hang before
the week is out.
Right there. Don't
move, all right?
Check the other one.
I didn't do anything!
Go!
Backs to the wall!
These are children, please!
- Clear!
- Clear!
Are you okay?
The mayor's going to get
me killed, Coriolanus.
He already thinks it was me.
Billy Taupe, Mayfair, both dead.
If they catch Spruce
now, or Sejanus talks...
- Sejanus won't talk.
- How do you know that?
They torture the
people they catch
for information here.
Even Peacekeepers.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I should have dealt
with those guns myself.
And Mayfair...
I just wasn't thinking straight.
I have to run. North.
Like Billy Taupe and
the others talked about.
Away from the districts.
If I stay here now, I'm
as good as dead, too.
What about the Covey?
They can look after each other.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I'll come with you.
- What about your family?
- Look.
I just learned Hoff is sending
me to 2 for Officer Training
- but none of that matters now.
- You were gonna leave.
It's all Panem.
As soon as they find that
gun, they'll hang me.
No matter which district I'm in.
When can you go?
Tomorrow.
- Dawn.
- Okay.
Okay.
Meet me at the Hanging
Tree. First light.
Whoo-hoo!
We got one. I
think we got one.
They say his name is Spruce.
Three years...
I fought for the
Capitol during the war.
I've been angry.
But this is the first
time I've felt ashamed.
Get the other one up here.
Coryo.
Coryo. Coryo.
The Capitol has received
word via jabberjay
that these two men conspired
to break into our base's jail
and flee north
to release this
terrorist from captivity.
I'd expect this of a rebel
but not from one of our own.
This is treason,
plain and simple.
Play the recording!
The leader, Spruce,
he wants to get his sister, Lil,
out of jail on base. Hoff
is going to execute her...
No, Coryo. Coryo, help!
Just because she knows the man
- that they killed. It's wrong.
-  No, no, no! Ma! Help! Ma!
Ma!
Help!
Ma! Ma!
No, no!
Ma! Ma! Ma!
Help! Ma! Help!
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

Yeah, I'll miss the Covey.
Hope they'll follow
me someday, though.
You know what I won't miss?
People.
People aren't so bad.
Not really.
It's what the
world does to them.
Like all of us in the arena.
I think there's a
natural goodness
born into us all.
No, really.
You can either cross
that line into evil...
or not.
And it's our life's work
to stay on the right
side of that line.
- It's not always that simple.
- Mmm.
I know.
I'm a victor.
Sure will be nice not to
have to kill anyone else
up north, though, huh?
Three's enough for me.
I'm gonna make a walking stick.
You want one?
You killed three?
Who's the third?
What?
Person you killed, Coriolanus.
You said you killed
three people.
I only know about
two. Do not lie to me.
- Can you help me get this out?
- There was Bobbin in the arena
and Mayfair. And
who's the third?
My old self.
I killed him so I
could come with you.
Come on.
Why don't we stop
here at the cabin?
- Wait out the storm?
- We should really keep going.
We're gonna need
food, Lucy Gray.
Let's catch some fish
while we're here.
If you want to fish,
there's rods under
the floorboards.
These ones?
Uh-huh.
What is it?
It's the gun.
The one you fired at Mayfair.
Spruce must have known about this place.
If we destroy that gun, you're free.
You can go back home.
Will you?
No more loose ends.
Besides me.
Besides you?
You wouldn't tell anyone.
'Course not.
I'm just gonna go
dig up some katniss.
There's a good patch
down by the lake.
I thought it was
too early for that.
Well, the world
changes awful fast.
Lucy Gray.
It's still raining.
Well, I'm not made out of sugar.

Sir.
How's the arm, Private?
The medic said you
took quite a bite.
Nothing that I won't have forgotten
about by the time I reach 2, sir.
There's been a change
of plan, Private Snow.
Congratulations, Mr. Snow.
You've passed all my tests.
I've asked President Ravinstill
to grant you a full pardon,
effective immediately.
I also told him that
you are too promising
to waste in the military.
So you'll be
studying under me now
at the Capitol University.
I can't afford University.
A certain Mr. Strabo
Plinth has offered
to pay for everything you need
while you're there.
All for being such a good friend
to his Sejanus.
He doesn't know quite how good
a friend you were, of course.
I never mentioned
your little recording.
Quite impressive,
how you sent your only
friend to the noose
just to get my attention.
- That's not what I did.
- Are you sure?
Because I think that won you
the Plinth Prize, after all.
The President has agreed to
another year of the Games.
People watched.
And I have you to
thank for that.
But before I take
you under my wing,
after everything you've seen
out there in the real world,
let me ask you one final time.
What are the Hunger Games for?
I used to think that
the Hunger Games
were punishment
for the districts.
Then I thought they
served as a warning
to us here in the Capitol
about the threat
the districts posed.
Now I know the whole
world is an arena.
And we need the Hunger Games.
Every year.
To remind us all
who we truly are.
And who are you,
do you determine?
The victor.
Welcome home, Mr. Snow.
Oh!
You look so handsome.
What do you think?
I think you look just like
your father, Coriolanus.
Sejanus Plinth's
personal effects
from District 12.
I was going to return this
to his parents tonight.
As a gift.
It would have been
his 19th birthday.
But I think...
they would prefer just this.
Best friends.
You grew a heart
in the districts.
No, not in the districts.
In the Hunger Games.
I should be thanking you.
The credit for the Hunger Games
goes to your father.
Half of it, at least.
I only dreamt them
up as an assignment.
A joke.
I was drunk.
Devise a punishment for
our enemies so extreme,
they will never forget how
badly they've wronged us.
When I sobered up, I
wanted to destroy it.
But your father, my best friend,
he'd stolen it from me.
Put both our names on it,
taken it to Gaul
to rise up himself.
I tried morphling...
the night that first child fell.
I hoped the Games might die out.
I tried to stop them
however I could.
But then you came along.
Now the blood of so
many more generations
will be on my hands.
Because you've
shown us the price
people are willing to
pay for a good show.
Tell me...
was she sad when you left 12?
Your little songbird?
I expect it made us both sad.
My contacts inform me
that she's disappeared.
That the mayor might have
killed her out there.
But there's no proof.
It's a mystery.
And mysteries have a way
of driving people mad.
Look at you.
Heir to the Plinth fortune,
nothing in your way.
Snow lands on top.
Yeah.
It's the things we love most
that destroy us.
