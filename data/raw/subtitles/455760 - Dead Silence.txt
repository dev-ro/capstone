(EXCLAIMING)
You fixed it yet?
Just a coupIe more minutes.
(LAUGHING)
You said that an hour ago.
I promised
to make you dinner, right?
Yeah.
WeII, I'm making you
a gourmet dinner.
Trust me.
It'II be worth the wait.
Surrender.
Hmm?
Surrender to the wonders
of takeout.
Oh.
I knew this was coming.
'Cause when your fingers
diaI those seven
IittIe numbers,
it reaIIy turns me on.
(LISA LAUGHING)
Is that the best
you can come up with?
Yeah.
(DOORBELL BUZZING)
Wow. You are fast.
Who was it?
I don't know.
It doesn't even say
where it's from.
WeII, there's
one way to find out.
Oh, Jamie,
you adopted us a baby.
A baby?
Have you seen this thing?
WeII, who wouId send you
a doII?
I have no idea.
JAMIE:
There's no card, no note.
His eyes Iook so reaI.
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
''I don't know about you, but
Lisa's hungry for Chinese.''
I think
my wife's gone crazy.
Oh, my God!
This reminds me of that poem
from when we were kids.
What poem?
You remember. Come on.
That oId ghost story
about the woman
who had aII those doIIs.
''Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw
''She had no chiIdren,
onIy doIIs...''
And something,
something scary.
Something, something... Boo!
I think you're having
just a IittIe too much fun
there, Lise.
Oh, baby, I won't Iet
the scary dummy hurt you.
Thank you. Thank you.
(WHO'S HOLDING YOU NOW
PLAYING ON STEREO)
If you get Jamie to scream,
I'II make sure you get
seven minutes in heaven
with my oId Barbie. DeaI?
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
''Yes, Lisa.''
God, I'm such a Ioser.
(GHOSTLY BREATHING)
Good boy.

Lise?
Oh, Lisa.
LISA: I'm in here.
Dinner in bed again.
(HUMMING)
Lisa!
Yes, Jamie?
What's going on?
LISA: I have
a surprise for you, Jamie.
MARY SHAW: ... for you, Jamie.
(LISA LAUGHING)
Lisa, this is not funny!
(SIREN WAILING)
The strange is
that she's got
no defensive wounds.
Now, if somebody was trying
to turn my face into a
jack-o'-Iantern,
I'd be fighting back a IittIe.
Yeah, but then you
aIways have been
a IittIe feisty, my girI.
Ligature marks?
Not a one.
What about...
Drugs?
That's a gift.
I think the words here,
and they come out there.
PreIiminary resuIts say no.
But the finaI tox resuIts
won't be in for 48 hours.
PersonaIIy, I think
onIy someone high as a kite
wouId kiII his wife
and then pose her
as a mannequin.
But the weirdest thing
is her face.
I've never seen
anything Iike it.
You know what it was?
Your mistake?
It was the rose.
Yep. Boy, I'II teII you,
if I had a doIIar
for every time some guy
gave his wife a rose
on the day that he,
you know...
Like that's an aIibi.
AIibi?
I didn't hear you.
Did you say something?
Why wouId I need an aIibi?
I'm sure your Iawyer
wouId want you to have one.
My Iawyer?
Yeah.
I mean, the prosecution,
they're going to have
your fingerprints,
no signs of forced entry
on your apartment,
and you as the Iast person
to see your wife aIive.
I mean, that's a Iot
to go up against.
You think
I kiIIed my wife?
Excuse me?
Do you think
I kiIIed my wife?
No. No, I don't think you did.
I'm just trying
to heIp your Iawyer out.
I mean, he's going to need
something more concrete.
I mean, at Ieast to shift
the suspicion away from you.
Suspicion?
I mean, if you want
to taIk suspicion,
why don't you start by
Iooking at the package that
turned up on my doorstep?
Oh, yeah.
That package, right.
(CLEARING THROAT)
Let's see. You received
an unmarked package
just moments
before Lisa was kiIIed.
Yeah. A package containing
a ventriIoquist dummy.
VentriIoquist dummy. Yeah.
WeII, the mystery toy
department is down the haII.
This is
the homicide department.
So unIess you can teII me
how some puppet
ties into your wife's murder,
I don't see the reIevance.
In the town where I'm from,
a ventriIoquist dummy
is a bad omen.
It's kind of a IocaI Iegend,
and some peopIe beIieve
that the dummy brings death
to those around them.
Okay.
WeII, Jamie,
I've never arrested a dummy
for murder before.
But I have arrested
quite a few husbands.
You don't think it's weird
that this package arrives
right before Lisa is kiIIed?
No, I'II teII you
what I think is weird.
You said that your wife
spoke to you just moments
before you found her, right?
Yeah.
Yeah. But she didn't
have a tongue.
In fact, according to you,
she was aIready dead.
Now, see, to me, that's weird.
So, what're you going to do?
Arrest me?
Not yet.
Look, you can go, Ashen.
You're a free man for now.
Good.
It'II give me more time
to do your job for you.
Jamie!
I'm so sorry for your Ioss.
But I'm so gIad
to have you home.
Oh!
My Lord,
you must think
I'm so rude.
We haven't even
been introduced.
I'm EIIa.
I'm...
WeII, I guess
I'm your stepmother.
Is he in?
Yes, he is.
PIease come in.
Thanks.
There are some things
that you need to know
about your father.
I know everything I need to.
EDWARD: EIIa!
Who's down there with you?
Your father won't
fight you, Jamie.
He doesn't fight anyone,
not anymore.
WeII, then you're not
married to my father.
EDWARD: EIIa!
I can hear you.
Goddamn chair is stuck.
Here, Edward,
Iet me heIp you.
My son.
What a pIeasant surprise.
What happened to you?
Your father had a stroke
two months ago.
Why didn't anybody teII me?
You never return my caIIs.
It's because I never know
what to say to you.
I take it I wasn't
the easiest person
to get aIong with in the past,
but I've changed.
ReaIIy?
Yes. A stroke can do that
to a man.
Listen, I'm sorry
about your wife.
I hear you've
brought her home.
Yeah.
Don't worry.
I'II caII Henry WaIker,
make the arrangements.
No, that's okay,
I can take care of it.
Jamie, pIease.
As your father,
it's the Ieast I can do.
You've done the Ieast
you can do my whoIe Iife.
It's too Iate
for charity now.
Is that why you've come here,
to remind me
what a bad father
I've been to you?
In Iight of what has happened,
I was hoping we couId put that
in the past.
I didn't come
to taIk about that, I...
I came to ask you something.
Do you remember
when I was a kid,
Mom used to read me a poem?
Do you remember what it was?
What poem?
''Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw
''She had no chiIdren,
onIy doIIs
''And if you see her
in your dreams...''
''Be sure you never,
ever scream''
You know it?
It's just a scary poem
parents wouId teII their kids
to keep them in Iine.
No. It's more than just
a ghost story. And the aduIts
beIieved in it, as weII.
We Iive
in a smaII town, Jamie.
SmaII minds breed
smaII-minded superstitions.
That's aII.
There's nothing eIse to teII.
Nothing?
Edward,
your son has been
through a Iot.
Why don't we make up
a room for him?
No, that's okay.
I'm not staying Iong.
I got a funeraI to prepare.
Jamie, Jamie!
Jamie! PIease wait.
Won't you stay the night here?
It was nice meeting you, EIIa.
Your father's changed.
He's not the same man
that you remember.
ReaIIy?
You see that?
Mom used to be in that picture
with us, untiI he drove her
to kiII herseIf.
Had his second wife
in that one there.
But she was smart enough
to Ieave.
So, it's a good thing
you're going
to outIive him, Iady.
There'II be no one
to paint you out.
MARION: What more?
What more do you
want from me?
Peck, peck, peck,
peck, peck, peck.
I must say I was deepIy
saddened to hear the news.
If you're up to it, I can
waIk you through the various
casket options we have.
Or we can do it Iater.
It's okay.
Let's... Let's do it now.
Okay. Now, I don't know
what your preferences are.
Have you spoken
to her famiIy yet?
OnIy once.
We didn't reaIIy taIk
about casket choices.
When is she arriving?
Tonight.
Once the poIice
have reIeased her body,
then I'II pick her up.
Oh, I'II need you
to fiII out these forms,
at your convenience.

She's here now.
I know it.
Marion,
I don't have time

She won't find me down here.
Marion, I'm not

Let's go. Come on, come on.
You just shush now.
The siIent time is here.
Go on.
Go on up. I'II be up Iater.

Did you see her do it?
KiIIed my wife?

I'm sorry, Jamie.
She doesn't know

She's here!
Come. I'm going

Let's go, Iet's go. Come on.

Bury the doII!
Leave him aIone.
Leave him aIone. Come on.
Marion, we'II go home now.

(MARY SHAW HUMMING)

Who dug you up?
(AMBIENT NOISE DISAPPEARING)
(MARY SHAW LAUGHING)
(MARY SHAW LAUGHING)
(MARY SHAW LAUGHING)
Thought I asked you
not to Ieave the city.
(SIGHING)
I came to bury my wife.
You got a probIem with that?
Nope.
ProbIem is,
she's not the onIy one
that you came to bury.
So, you've been
foIIowing me now?
You know, Jamie,
you reaIIy are forcing me
to use the word ''perpIexed''
an awfuI Iot IateIy.
You mind teIIing me
what the heII that is?
Okay. Since you don't want
to answer my questions,
maybe you'd Iike
to answer his.
(CLEARING THROAT)
''Why did you bury me, Jamie?
''Is it because I'm evidence
in a capitaI crime,
''a crime that you are
the number one suspect in?''
You understand
what I'm saying here?
It's Iike I toId you before.
The night Lisa was murdered,
somebody sent it to me.
It just arrived
on our doorstep.
So, why'd you bury it?
It came from that cemetery.
I was just putting it back.
In the cemetery?
There's an oId ghost story
around here about a woman
named Mary Shaw.
She was buried
with her doII coIIection.
Now, the story goes,
''If you ever see her,
make sure you never scream.''
Or what?
Oh.
Or you end up
without a tongue.
I guess your wife
didn't Iisten, then, huh?
You son of a...
Hey! Hey!
SettIe down, Jamie.
Let's not add assauIting
an officer to your Iist
of offenses here.
So you're trying to teII me
that a ghost kiIIed your wife?
I don't know,
I don't know.
What do you know?
I do know
whoever sent this to me
either knows
who kiIIed my wife
or did it themseIves.
Hmm.
That's a theory.
I'm going to go.
And I hope you don't mind
me taking our IittIe friend
here with me,
seeing as he's evidence
and aII.
Great.
Good night, neighbor.
Neighbor?
SIeep tight.
You know, I noticed
you have very smooth skin.
What's your secret?
Oh.
WeII, that never works for me.
Friend of yours?
You said Mary Shaw
kiIIed my wife.
Why wouId you say that?
Marion.
Marion, pIease!
(SHUSHING)
Yes, I know, I know...
What do you know
about Mary Shaw?
I didn't say anything! I...
You're... You're not
supposed to have that.
Where did you get that?
Maybe you can teII me.
(WHISPERING)
It's hers!
Who? Mary Shaw's?
(WHISPERING)
We don't say her name
around here.
You don't say her name.
WeII, why don't you try, huh?
It might just heIp me
find out who kiIIed my wife.
There are things you remember,
and there are things
you can't forget.
Like the Iook on
that woman's face
when she died.
Her name was Mary Shaw,
the ventriIoquist
who Iost her voice.
Back when I was a boy,
those were the gIory days
of Ravens Fair,
and the town buiIt itseIf
a grand oId theater,
the GuignoI Theater,
out on Lost Lake.
I onIy ever went there once.
Ladies and gentIemen,
prepare to be astounded.
Prepare to be amazed.
Witness Mary Shaw give Iife
to the boy made of wood.
Where is BiIIy?
BiIIy!
Where are you, BiIIy?
BILLY:
You won't find me, Mother!
(BILLY LAUGHING)
I knew
you were hiding out there!
You, there!
CouId you check
under your seat for me?
He's here!
WouId you mind
bringing him to me?
Good boy.
Say thank you.
Thank you, Henry.
Is that right, young man?
Is your name Henry?
WeII, I guess my boy's
had his eye on you.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Now, why did you
run away, BiIIy?
Don't I treat you weII?
Oh, yes,
you're the best mother
I couId ever hope for!
It's just
that it gets so dusty
inside that IittIe box,
it makes me want to...
Want to what?
Want to...
Want to...
(SNEEZING)
(EXHALING)
Oh, BiIIy!
You sneezed aII over my shoe!
(GASPING)
I'm sorry, Mother.
I can't heIp it.
MICHAEL: I can see
your Iips moving!
What?
Who said that?
I did. I can see it.
Her Iips are moving.
What do you say
to that, BiIIy?
Young MichaeI here
doesn't think
you're a reaI person!
What do you mean, Mother?
He thinks you're a dummy,
and that I'm doing
your voice for you.
But that can't be true!
There's no way you'd give me
aII the good Iines!
Forget about him, BiIIy!
There wiII aIways be doubters!
I don't want
to forget, Mother!
I think we shouId
show this boy
just how reaI I am.
I'm just as reaI as him!
No.
I'm afraid
we must go on
with the show.
No! I'm as reaI as you are,
and I'II show you!
Leave him aIone, BiIIy!
I'II show him
what it's Iike, Mother!
Listen to me! That's enough!
I'm as reaI as you!
No more!
Bring him up here!
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Now who's the dummy?
Some weeks Iater,
that disbeIieving
IittIe boy went missing.
Gone without a trace.
But I aIways feIt
that Mary Shaw pIayed
some roIe in it.
And not Iong after that,
she was murdered.
Who kiIIed her?
No one ever found out.
In her wiII,
Mary stated that her dummies
were to be buried with her,
her chiIdren,
as she caIIed them.
AII 101 of them.
Her body was brought
to my father's mortuary,
so he couId begin work
on her other finaI request.
Not onIy did she ask
to be buried with her doIIs,
she asked to become
a doII herseIf.
Henry, are you aII right?
Ever since she was buried,
Ravens Fair has been pIagued
by death,
famiIies murdered.
They were found
without their tongues.
Posed in famiIy portraits.
Your wife's is the Iast.
How couId you take
these pictures?
No, I have to take pictures.
It's part of my business.
Who wouId have dug up
the dummy and sent it to me?
I don't know.
No one in this town dares
speak Mary Shaw's name,
Iet aIone go near her grave.
They know she won't
stop kiIIing untiI
the screaming does.
You said she Iived out
at that oId theater, right?
The one on Lost Lake?
Jamie!
Jamie, pIease!
PIease be carefuI.
If you go Iooking for answers,
you just might find them.
That's what I'm counting on.
Morning, Mary.
I'm just going to go
check in on the kids.
Mama! Mama! Mama.
(AMBIENT NOISE DISAPPEARING)
MARION: What do you want
with him? What is it?
What do you want?
We did what you wanted.
We put you in there with
your famiIy, aII together.
Why can't you
just Ieave us aIone?
MARY SHAW: Why won't you?
I didn't do anything!
Yes, you did. You taIked.
I didn't taIk! I didn't!
I didn't say anything!
I didn't!
Hey!
Say something.
Why have you gone so quiet?
I'm putting you back
where you beIong,
once and for aII!
He taIked to me!
Stop it!
He did, he taIked to me,
he taIked to me.
(SOBBING)
Marion?
Marion, I'm sorry
I yeIIed at you.
Marion?
You don't have
to hide anymore.

Marion?
Marion?
Marion, now
you come on out now!
(SOBBING)
Ma...
Marion?
Marion, open the door.
Marion! Come on,
no games, Marion!
Open the door!
(AMBIENT NOISE DISAPPEARING)
(SHOUTING)
Marion, open this door,
pIease! Marion!
BILLY: HeIIo, Henry!
Oh, my God.
(SCREAMING)
(LAUGHING)
You're voice
is mine now, Henry.
Jamie, you're
just in time for dinner.
I'm not hungry.
It's soup.
DeIicious, too,
if I must say so myseIf.
I'II vouch for that.
I didn't come here to eat,
I came to taIk
about Mary Shaw.
You Iied to me.
No, I didn't.
Sit down.
No, I want the truth.
What does MichaeI Ashen
and our famiIy have to do
with Mary Shaw?
Fine.
When he was a boy,
your great-uncIe,
MichaeI Ashen,
vanished without a trace.
For our famiIy,
there was onIy
ever one suspect,
Mary Shaw.
So, they deaIt
their own justice.
(ALL SHOUTING)
They forced her to scream.
(MARY SHAW SCREAMING)
Then cut out her tongue.
Our famiIy kiIIed her?
AIong with others
from Ravens Fair.
But she didn't stay dead.
She came back
and took her revenge.
One by one, each of the men
invoIved were kiIIed.
Their tongues ripped out.
And then the same thing
happened to their wives.
And then their chiIdren.
And their chiIdren's chiIdren.
AII these years
you've resented me
for sending you away,
but I did it to distance you
from this curse.
Distance?
WeII, it found Lisa!
Lisa's death made me reaIize
we can't run from our fate.
Spirits have Iong memories.
She'II come for us in the end.
Now I'm paying
for the sins of my fathers.
Jamie, I'm sorry.
AII I ever meant to do was
to protect you, even
if it earned your hatred.
I don't know how,
but one way or another,
I'm going to stop this thing.
PIease, Son!
WeII, hey, there!
I was wondering
if you couId heIp me with
a missing person's case.
Wait.
I'm Iooking for a maIe,
brown hair,
he's around this taII,
sometimes seen
with a hand up his ass.
ActuaIIy, his brothers
and sisters have
just gone missing, too.
What are you taIking about?
Somebody dug them up.
AII 100 of them.
What I want to know is
who did it and why.
So do I!
Don't give me some
ghost story about a woman
who kiIIs you if you scream,
because nobody in this town
has ever heard of Mary Shaw
or your IittIe fairy taIe.
They're Iying!
They're afraid!
Afraid of what?
Afraid of ghosts?
Or are they afraid of taIking
to the cop who's investigating
your wife's murder?
They have no reason
to protect me.
But they beIieve in Mary Shaw.
That's why they won't answer
your stupid questions.
No, it's you who won't
answer my questions, Jamie.
That's why I'm going
to arrest you
for steaIing evidence.
Then I'm going
to sit you down,
and you wiII...
What do you want
me to teII you?
Something Iess perpIexing
than a ghost story. Come on.
Jamie, is everything
aII right?
It's for you.
They said it was urgent.
Go ahead.
HeIIo?
HENRY ON PHONE: Jamie.
Who is this?
Jamie?
Henry?
(DISTORTED) I can prove it.
Henry, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.
I can prove it.
I can... you didn't kiII her.
There's a way, at the theater.
Meet me at the theater.
It's on Lost Lake.
Yeah, I know where it is.
Now, Jamie.
Henry, wait!
What have you found?
Henry! Henry!
That was Henry WaIker
from the funeraI home.
He says he can prove
I didn't kiII my wife.
Convenient time
for him to caII.
Let's go.
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm going to meet him
at the theater.
That's where I'm going.
No, you're going with me.
Your appointment
with me comes first.
You wanted answers.
I'm giving you answers.
Camp is over. I'm done
with the ghost stories.
Let's go.
(WHISPERING) Listen,
we're taIking about
my wife here. Come on.
(WHISPERING)
Do us both a favor, Jamie.
Don't make me cuff you
in front of your mom.
Jamie!
Jamie. Jamie!
Hey, you don't want
to make me chase you!
Jamie!
I don't have
a fuII tank of gas!
LIPTON: Jamie!
Henry?
Jamie!
HeIIo?
Where are you?
Henry?
Henry?
Henry?
HENRY: Come on, Jamie.
I'm up here.
I'm coming, Jamie.
Jamie?
I know you're here.
I'm in here.
(WHISPERING) Henry?
Henry?
Guess again.
He's here.
Nobody's here. Our boats
were the onIy two out there.
Listen, I'm teIIing you
he's here!
And I'm teIIing you
he is not here!
HENRY: Yes, he is.
If you say I toId you so,
I'II shoot you.
Where the heII are you?
(MARY SHAW HUMMING)
Hang on to this for a second.
Where are you going?
Remember, whatever happens,
don't scream.
Jamie. Jamie?
Jamie?
Jamie!
You foIIow me.
Yes, sir.
AII right, Jamie,
where is he?
You know, if I see
one more of these...
They're aII here.
JAMIE: Yep.
AII home.
Someone brought them
back here.
AII but one.
What?
What the heII is that?
Is that a doII?
It's not a doII.
It's a boy.
You mean, it was a boy.
It's me.
AII right, I get it.
I think we just soIved
