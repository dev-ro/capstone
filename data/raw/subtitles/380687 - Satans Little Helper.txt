I DON'T DEAL WITH THE ACTORS.
- YOU DON'T?
- NO.
NO.
NO!
HEY!
STOP!
TALK TO FINN.
HE KNOWS.
HE RUNS THE WHOLE SHOW.
HIS NUMBER'S IN THE TELETEXT
OVER THERE.
- I ALREADY MET UP
WITH OLD MATE FINN.
HE TOLD ME A LOT OF THINGS.
HOW DO YOU THINK
I WOUND UP HERE?
- I SWEAR TO GOD,
I NEVER TOUCHED HER.
- YEAH, WELL, SOMEONE DID.
- IT WASN'T ME.
IT WASN'T ME.
I JUST BUILT THE FUCKIN' SET!
NO!
NO.
OH, SHIT!
HEY!

- OH, YEAH.
I'LL HAVE THE RUMP STEAK,
MEDIUM RARE,
WITH PEPPER SAUCE, THANKS.
- CHIPS OR VEGGIES?
- JUST VEGGIES.
- WON'T BE LONG.
- THANKS.
- ARE YOU GOING NORTH?
- NO, WRONG WAY.
- I'M TRYING
TO GET TO ROCKHAMPTON.
- SORRY.
I'LL TAKE YOU IF YOU WANT.
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU COULDN'T.
- YOU WANT A RIDE OR NOT?
- I'VE GOT ONE.
- YOU RUNNING FROM SOMEWHERE?
- I'M VISITING A FRIEND.
- A FRIEND.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
- HOW OLD ARE YOU?
- I'M 44, AND I DON'T WANT
TO GET PULLED OVER
WITH SOME UNDERAGE RUNAWAY
IN THE CAR.
CATCH MY DRIFT?
- I'M 18, SO YOU CAN RELAX.
AND I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY.
I JUST NEED
TO GET TO ROCKHAMPTON.
- YEAH, WELL,
I'LL BE PASSING THROUGH.
- COOL.
IT SMELLS LIKE A BARBECUE
IN HERE.
- IT'S DINNER.
PASS IT OVER.

I MIGHT JUST STEAL SOME VEGGIES.
SO, UH...
IS THIS A BUSINESS TRIP?
- YEAH.

- PEST CONTROL.
- OH.
I USUALLY JUST
SWEEP BUGS OUTSIDE,
EXCEPT FOR HUNTSMAN SPIDERS.
- CAN YOU PASS ME A NAPKIN
FROM IN THE GLOVE BOX?
- WHO'S THIS?
- MY DAUGHTER.
- WHAT'S HER NAME?
- JESSE.
- DOES SHE LIVE WITH YOU?
- YOU MAY WANT TO TAKE A SEAT.
SHE WAS FOUND LYING ON HER BACK,
WHICH MEANS WHEN SHE VOMITED,
THE AIRWAYS BECAME BLOCKED,
CAUSING SUFFOCATION.
THE TOXICOLOGY REPORT FOUND
ALCOHOL, COCAINE,
AND HEROIN IN HER BLOOD.
WE ALSO FOUND TRACES OF SEMEN.
- WHERE DID THEY FIND HER?
- THATCHER'S LANE.
EMERGENCY SERVICES RECEIVED AN
ANONYMOUS CALL FROM A PAY PHONE.
- SOMEONE WAS WITH HER.
- IT APPEARS SO.
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, BEING
AN INDUSTRIAL AREA ON A SUNDAY,
WE'RE FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT
TO GET A WITNESS.
*
- HI, THERE.
CAN I HELP YOU?
- YEAH, I'VE COME ABOUT
ONE OF THE VIDEOS YOU STOCK.

OUR FULL CATALOGUE?
- NO, BUT THIS IS THE ONE
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN.

MOST OF OUR BUSINESS
THROUGH THE MAIL OR BY PHONE,
SO IN THE FUTURE,
JUST GIVE US A CALL.

SO, UM, THIS VIDEO,
HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE?
- COUPLE OF HUNDRED.
WHY, DO YOU WANT 'EM ALL?
- YEAH.
- YOU SERIOUS?
- YEAH, I WANTED
EVERY SINGLE COPY.

WHEN I FIND A GOOD MOVIE,
I TAKE IT TO THE STORES.

DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THINGS,
BUT, HEY,
I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY.
WE GOT 231 COPIES HERE.
SO YOU WANT 'EM ALL?

INCLUDING GST,
YOU'RE LOOKING AT $2,656.50.

MICK, CAN YOU BRING OUT ALL THE
COPIES WE HAVE OF VIDEO 26160,
YOUNG CITY SLUTS?

WHO MADE THIS?
- SURE DO.
FINN AND I GO WAY BACK.
THERE'S YOUR ORDER SLIP.
JUST SHOW IT TO MICK
ON YOUR WAY OUT.
- SO FINN,
HE'S THE PRODUCER?
- WELL, I GUESS
YOU'D CALL HIM THAT.
SPENDS MOST OF HIS TIME
DOING FIGHT PROMOTIONS.
ACTUALLY, THIS VIDEO WAS SHOT
AT ONE OF HIS GYMS.
- REALLY?
WERE YOU THERE
WHEN THEY SHOT IT?
- YOU OFTEN ADVISE PEOPLE
ON THOSE SHOOTS.
IMAGINE BEING SO CLOSE,
YOU CAN SMELL IT.
- I WANT TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH FINN, YOU KNOW,
SEE WHAT ELSE HE'S GOT.
- YEAH, I COULD ORGANIZE THAT.
IT'LL ALL BE
IN OUR BACK CATALOGS.

IN COMMISSIONING SOME WORK.

AIN'T HE, OLD FINN?
LET ME GRAB
YOUR POSTAL ADDRESS
SO I CAN PUT YOU
ON OUR MAILING LIST.
- NO, I'D REALLY LIKE
TO CONTACT HIM.
I GOT SOME GREAT IDEAS.
- DON'T WE ALL, MATE?
I JUST CAN'T GIVE OUT
HIS DETAILS.
LET ME GIVE HIM A CALL.
HE CAN CONTACT YOU.
- WRITE DOWN THE ADDRESS.
GIVE ME THE ADDRESS.
I WANT HIS HOME ADDRESS,
NOT A P.O. BOX.
- I DON'T HAVE IT.
- THEN TELL ME
WHERE HIS GYM IS.
WHO ELSE FUCKED HER?
- WHAT?
- IN THE VIDEO,
THERE'S THREE OF THEM,
BUT THE COPS TELL ME
THERE WERE FOUR INVOLVED.
- THE COPS?
WHAT HAVE YOU TOLD 'EM?
- WHO WAS IT?
YOU?
THIS FINN?
SOMEONE ELSE?
- I WOULDN'T HAVE A CLUE.
- DID SHE SMELL GOOD?
- WHAT?
- DID SHE SMELL GOOD?
- THERE'S A POT DOWN THERE.
- IT'S AN URN.
- REALLY?
- YEAH.
MY DAUGHTER'S IN THERE--
HALF OF HER, ANYWAY.
MY WIFE HAS THE REST OF HER.
- HOW DID SHE...
- HEROIN.
- THAT'S AWFUL.
ARE YOU GONNA
SCATTER HER SOMEWHERE?
- I DON'T KNOW YET.
- YEAH, RIGHT.
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, FINN.
- ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE, MAN.
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
ABOUT JESSICA FORTESKY,
THE GIRL IN THE VIDEO.
HOW DID SHE GET INVOLVED?
- I TOLD YOU,
SHE CAME TO ME.
SHE JUST WANTED TO MAKE
SOME EXTRA DOSH.
- HOW MUCH WAS SHE WORTH?
- WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?
- BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.
- HOW?
- HEROIN, BUT YOU ALREADY
KNOW THAT!
- FUCK OFF!
I'VE BEEN IN THIS FUCKING
BUSINESS FOR 20 YEARS!
YOU THINK I'D STILL BE AROUND
IF I DRUGGED MY ACTORS, EH?
LOOK AT HER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES!
YOU THINK I WANTED HER
LIKE THAT?
- THEN WHY DID YOU SHOOT HER?
- BECAUSE IT'S
FUCKING EXPENSIVE, YEAH?
LOOK, NO ONE HAD
A PROBLEM WITH IT.
- SOMEONE CALLED AN AMBULANCE
FOR HER
AND LEFT HER
IN A FUCKING ALLEYWAY TO DIE!
- AND YOU FUCKING THINK
IT WAS ONE OF US, EH?
YOU THINK WE FUCKIN'
WERE ALL INVOLVED IN IT, EH?
TELL YOU WHAT, MATE.
SHE CAME HERE STONED
OFF HER FUCKING TITS, YEAH?
SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO DO,
YOU HEAR?
ALL THAT ROOTIN', YEAH?
COLLECTED HER MONEY
AND BUGGERED OFF ALL BY HERSELF.
YOU THINK WE FUCKIN'
HAD ANYTHING TO HIDE, EH?
DO YOU THINK
IF WE HAD ANYTHING TO HIDE,
WE'D BE MAKING FUCKIN' HUNDREDS
OF VIDEOS,
SENDING IT AROUND THE WORLD?
DO YOU THINK SO, EH?
YOU THINK I'M GONNA DO THAT
IF WE FUCKIN' BUMPED HER OFF?
FUCKIN' HELL.
LOOK.
JUST LET ME OUT OF THIS.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I KNOW.
YOU'RE FEELING CRANKY.
YOU'RE HER DAD, I KNOW,
OR WHAT ARE YOU?
FUCKIN' UNCLE, WHATEVER.
LOOK, MY KIDS
WERE JUST THE SAME.
THEY JUST WOULDN'T HAVE
THE BOTHER OF IT EITHER.
- I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES
OF EVERYONE INVOLVED,
STARTING WITH THE ACTORS.
- LOOK, MATE, YOU AIN'T GONNA
GET ANYWHERE WITH THIS BULLSHIT.
FORGET ABOUT IT, EH?
LOOK, NO ONE DID ANYTHING WRONG.
STAY FUCKING STILL.
- STAY FUCKING STILL.
YOU LIKE FOOTBALL?
TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
CHRIST!
YOU FUCKIN' BASTARD!
YOU'RE GONNA DIE FOR THIS!

YOU WANT MORE?

JIMMY, HE COME FROM UP NORTH
IN GLADSTONE.
- YES, I KNOW.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONES?
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.
FUCKIN' PAUL, HE SAID HE DRIVED
DOWN FROM MACKAY OR SOMETHING.
LOOK, IN MY PHONE.
IT'S IN THE FUCKING--
ON MY PANTS THERE.
JUST LOOK IN THERE.
ALL THE PHONE NUMBERS
ARE IN THERE.
GO ON, HAVE A LOOK.
IT'S UNDER PAUL LYNCHIP.
YOU GONNA FUCK OFF NOW?
YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED.
- I WANT THE OTHER ONE.
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER ONE?
- I DON'T FUCKIN' KNOW.
I NEVER DEALT WITH HIM.
HE'S JIM'S BROTHER.
HE'S HIS LITTLE BROTHER
OR SOMETHING.
YOU WANT HIM, JUST GO
AND FUCKIN' ASK JIM, ALL RIGHT?
- AND WHAT ABOUT THE TAPES
YOU SHOT ON?
- ALL RIGHT,
A BLOKE CALLED WALTERS, RIGHT?
HE LIVES IN IPSWICH;
HIS NUMBER'S IN THERE TOO.
NOW FUCK OFF!
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
- ALL RIGHT, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
FUCK OFF.
- NO, NO, NO.
NOW I WANT TO KNOW
WHO ELSE DID HER.
- KILL THIS PIECE
OF FUCKING SHIT!
- HEY, FINN.
YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?
- OH, YEAH, JUST FUCKIN' PEACHY.
I JUST GOT A BIKE PUMP
STUCK IN ME DICK!
NOW, BRING THAT FUCKIN' CUNT
IN HERE!
- YOU LIKE THAT?
HUH?
- OH, SHIT.
OH, SHIT.
- I APOLOGIZE IN ADVANCE
IF I START SNORING.
- WHATEVER.
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T
SLEEP NAKED.
- MIND IF I PUT THE TELLY
ON LIVE FOR A WHILE?
HELPS ME SLEEP.
- YEAH, THAT'S COOL.
I DO THAT AT HOME.
- DEVELOPMENTS IN
A FATAL HOUSE FIRE TODAY
AS INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE
ARSON IS TO BLAME.
THE REVELATION CAME
AS AUTHORITIES UNCOVERED
A PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO OPERATION
INSIDE THE RESIDENCE.
THE ENTERPRISE WAS LINKED
WITH TWO OTHER BUSINESSES
WHERE THREE MEN WERE MURDERED
EARLIER THIS WEEK.
- THE NEWS IS TOO DEPRESSING.
NOTHING ON?
- NOT REALLY.
I SAW YOUR ARM.
WHY DO YOU DO THAT?
- I DON'T ANYMORE.
WHY DO YOU?
- I DON'T KNOW.
MOST OF THE TIME,
I FEEL LIKE I'M IN A DAZE.
HELPS ME FEEL SOMETHING.
I'M GONNA HAVE A SHOWER.
OH, BEFORE I FORGET,
I MIGHT HAVE TO VISIT
A CLIENT TOMORROW.
HE LIVES NEARBY;
IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
- THAT'S OKAY.
I'LL JUST SLEEP IN.
- AFTER WE SPOKE ON THE PHONE,
I HAD A LOOK AROUND.
IF THERE'S ANYWHERE
THEY'RE GONNA BE,
THEY'LL BE IN THESE
OLD KENNELS HERE, I RECKON.
- THAT'S GOOD THINKING.
- I'VE BEEN MEANING TO TEAR THE
FUCKING THINGS DOWN FOR YEARS.
- OH, YEAH.
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.
- REALLY?
- JIM?
JIM?
- OH, FUCK.
- YOU WERE RECENTLY IN
A PORN SHOOT WITH MY DAUGHTER.
I WANT TO KNOW
WHO SHE LEFT WITH.
- YOU'RE A FUCKIN' DEAD MAN!
- WHO DID SHE LEAVE WITH?
- I DON'T KNOW.
SHE WAS STILL THERE
WHEN I LEFT.
I DON'T FUCKING KNOW.
- WHO ELSE WAS AT THE SHOOT?
- A PRODUCER, FINN.
SOME CAMERAMAN.
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.
AND THE GUY
THAT OWNED THE WAREHOUSE.
- WHICH ONE OF THEM FUCKED HER?
- I DON'T KNOW.
PROBABLY FINN.
- WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?
- YOU THINK I'M GONNA
TELL YOU THAT?
- YES, I DO, ACTUALLY.
- LISTEN, LISTEN.
YOUR DAUGHTER CAME TO THE SHOOT
BY HERSELF, MATE.
NO ONE FORCED HER
TO DO NOTHING.
- NO ONE FORCED HER
TO DO NOTHING.
NO ONE FUCKING FORCED HER
TO DO NOTHING!
YOU RAPED HER!
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU AFRAID?
COME ON, THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE AFRAID OF.
HMM?
NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.
IT'S JUST A LITTLE CUT.
LOOK.
TINY LITTLE CUT!
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.
WHICH ONE?
LEFT OR RIGHT?
- FUCK YOU!
- TELL ME WHERE
TO FIND YOUR BROTHER!
SPEAK!
- HE LIVES DOWN THE ROAD.
- SHUT YOUR FUCKING HOLE, IRENE!
- CHANTAM ROAD, NUMBER 64.
HE'S COMING OVER HERE SOON.
YOU'RE MR. FORTESKY,
AREN'T YOU?
- WHO ARE YOU?
- IRENE, HIS WIFE.
- YOU SENT THE VIDEO.
- YEAH.
- WHY?
WHAT'D YOU THINK I'D DO?
- I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS HOPING
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
THAT VIDEO TURNED UP
IN THE POST ONE DAY.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS,
SO I SAT DOWN AND WATCHED IT.
THEN I SAW HER FACE
IN THE PAPER.
THEY'RE PIGS,
HIM AND HIS FUCKING BROTHER.
- YOU BETTER GO.
COME BACK LATER
AND CALL THE POLICE.
THIS OKAY?
- FINE.
GET HIM!
- GET HIM!
- FUCK!
- OH, NO!
EDDY.
EDDY!
EDDY!
EDDY!
- HE'LL BE HERE
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
HAVE YOU GOT A LIGHT?
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN I STARTED SMOKING,
I WAS THE COOLEST
SON OF A BITCH IN SCHOOL.
NOT TILL 20 YEARS LATER
YOU THINK ABOUT QUITTING.
BY THEN YOUR TEETH ARE YELLOW,
YOU SMELL LIKE SHIT,
AND THEY GOT YOU BY THE BALLS.
SO HOW LONG YOU PLANNING
TO STAY UP HERE?
- DON'T KNOW.
- JUST PROMISE ME
NEXT TIME I COME THROUGH,
I DON'T SEE YOU WORKING HERE
WITH EIGHT KIDS.
- I'M NOT PLANNING
ON HAVING KIDS FOR A LONG TIME.
- I REMEMBER THINKING THAT.
THEN ONE DAY,
ME GIRLFRIEND GIVES ME A CALL,
TELLS ME SHE'S PREGNANT.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- I MARRIED HER.
- IT MUST SUCK FOR GUYS.
- JEEZ, I HAVEN'T HEARD
THAT BEFORE
FROM A MEMBER
OF THE FEMALE RACE.
- WELL, YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.
IF SHE WANTS IT,
SHE'S HAVING IT.
WELL, THAT'S HIM.
WELL, IT'S BEEN NICE
MEETING YOU.
- YOU TOO.
- I HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT.
- ALICE.
IT'S GOT MY MOBILE ON IT,
JUST IN CASE.
- THANKS, CHRISTIAN.
- SAY "BYE-BYE."
BYE-BYE.
I DON'T KNOW.
IT COULD'VE BEEN ANY OF THEM.
I DIDN'T HANG AROUND;
I JUST LEFT.
- OH, YOU LEFT TOO?
- YEAH.
YEAH, YOU CAN EVEN SEE ME
WALK OUT IN THE VIDEO.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,
I'LL PUT IT ON.
I'LL SHOW YOU.
- AND WHAT MADE YOU
SUDDENLY LEAVE?
- WHAT?
I WENT THERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT'D BE A BIT OF FUN.
AND THEN WHEN I SAW OTHERWISE,
I LEFT.
- AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?
- IT WAS JUST THE WAY THAT FINN
KEPT DIRECTING US.
HE KEPT SAYING,
"BE ROUGHER ON HER.
KEEP EVERYONE AT ONCE
GOING ON HER."
THE OTHER GUYS LOVED IT,
BUT I JUST WALKED OUT.
- YOU LEFT HER WITH THEM.
- NO.
NO, NO, NO,
I HAD WORDS WITH FINN.
I TOLD HIM THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT.
- AND WHAT DID HE SAY?
- HE SAID,
"THAT'S WHY SHE'S GETTING PAID."
- DID YOU TALK TO HER AT ALL?
- A LITTLE.
- DID SHE SAY WHY?
- WHY WHAT?
- WHY SHE WAS THERE.
- NO.
NO, IT WAS A QUICK INTRODUCTION.
THERE WERE DRINKS GOING AROUND.
FINN WAS BRINGING AROUND
LINES OF COKE.
EVERYONE WAS GETTING FUCKED UP.
- AND SHE HAD SOME.
- YEAH,
FINN WAS ENCOURAGING HER.
- WHY?
- I THINK SHE HAD HER DOUBTS.
SOMETHING ABOUT IT
NOT BEING ABOUT--
- HANG ON, HANG ON.
WAS SHE STONED
WHEN SHE GOT THERE?
- NO, NOT THAT I COULD TELL.
I DON'T KNOW.
- THEN WHEN DID SHE TAKE
THE HEROIN?
- HEROIN?
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
WHEN SHE DISAPPEARED WITH DEREK.
- WHO THE FUCK IS DEREK?
- HE--HE WORKS WITH FINN.
- AND SHE WENT SOMEWHERE
WITH HIM.
- YEAH, SHE--SHE LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS GONNA WALK OFF,
SO HE--SO HE TOOK HER IN A ROOM,
AND THEN, I DON'T KNOW.
THEY WERE IN THERE FOR A WHILE.
WHEN SHE CAME OUT, SHE--
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
SHE LOOKED ALL OVER THE PLACE.
- DO YOU THINK HE MIGHT HAVE...
FORCED HIMSELF?
- I DON'T KNOW.
YEAH, MAYBE.
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.
THEY WERE IN THERE LONG ENOUGH.
- AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
- THEN--
THEN FINN SAW--
THEN FINN SAW HER,
AND THEN HE HAD WORDS
WITH DEREK.
HE SAID--HE SAID HE DIDN'T
WANT HER LOOKING ALL DRUNK
AND WE HAD TO SHOOT STRAIGHTAWAY
BEFORE SHE PASSED OUT.
- FUCK! STOP!
WHERE THE FUCK
CAN I FIND THIS DEREK?
- I DON'T KNOW HIM.
- YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU DON'T KNOW!
YOU DON'T KNOW.
YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW?
- I DON'T KNOW HIM.
- YOU DON'T KNOW,
ALL RIGHT.
- PLEASE, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I DON'T KNOW HIM.
TALK TO FINN.
TALK TO FINN.
HE'S THE ONLY ONE
THAT KNOWS DEREK.
- FINN'S DEAD.
- WELL, THEN--
THEN TALK TO THE BROTHERS.
THEY KNEW HIM.
- YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE DEAD TOO.
- WAIT, PLEASE!
DO YOU THINK
I WANT TO PROTECT HIM?
I DON'T.
I JUST WANT TO HELP YOU.
PLEASE.
- YOU'D LIKE TO HELP?
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME TO DO?
- YOU GOT TO GIVE SOMETHING!
- LIKE WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
FIGHT THEM ALL?
SHE WAS THERE
BECAUSE SHE CHOSE TO BE.
- SHE FUCKIN' CHOSE TO BE?
SHE HAD NO CHOICE!
NO CHOICE!
GET UP!
- PLEASE, PLEASE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
WAIT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
YOU COULD JUST WALK WAY.
YOU COULD JUST WALK AWAY.
YOU KEEP THE VIDEOTAPE.
YOU CAN BLACKMAIL ME
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
I WON'T GO TO THE POLICE,
I PROMISE.
PLEASE.
I HAVE A FAMILY.
I HAVE A FAMILY.
PLEASE, PLEASE.
I HAVE A LITTLE DAUGHTER.
PLEASE?
- SO DID I.
SHE'S DEAD.
- I KNOW.
- NO, YOU DON'T.
SHE'S DEAD.
SHE'S NOT UP THERE
DANCING AROUND.
SHE'S A PILE OF DUST.
I CAN HOLD HER IN ONE HAND.
STILL, IT'S BETTER
THAN BURYING HER.
I COULDN'T BEAR THE THOUGHT
OF HER TINY LITTLE BODY
ROTTING IN THE GROUND.
HELLO?
- HI, CHRISTIAN.
IT'S ALICE.
- ALICE.
- UM, ARE YOU DRIVING BACK
TO BRISBANE ANY TIME SOON?
YEAH, I'M--I'M HEADING BACK
RIGHT NOW.
- HAVE YOU GONE PAST HERE YET?
- NO, I'LL BE PASSING THROUGH
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
- DO YOU THINK
I COULD CATCH A LIFT?
- OF COURSE THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
- I'M JUST
AT THE PETROL STATION.
- OKAY.
WELL, WAIT FOR ME THERE.
- OKAY, THANKS.
- HI.
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE PREGNANT, AREN'T YOU?
- TEN WEEKS.
- WHEN'D YOU FIND OUT?
- MONDAY.
- THIS GUY IN TOWN,
HE'S THE FATHER?
- I WANT TO GET IT SORTED,
BUT THE LONGER YOU LEAVE IT,
THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT GETS,
SO I NEEDED HIM TO CHIP IN.
- DID HE COME THROUGH?
- STOLE A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS
FROM HIS BROTHERS.
- YOUR PARENTS KNOW?
- DAD CALLED ME
A STUPID LITTLE SLUT,
AND MOM DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
SO FUCK THEM BOTH.
- WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING
TO GO NOW?
- MY FRIEND KIM
SAID I COULD STAY A WHILE,
AND I CAN GET TO SCHOOL
WITH HER.
- WELL, IF YOU WANT
MY TWO CENTS,
YOU PROBABLY SCARED THE SHIT
OUT OF THEM ALREADY
RUNNING AWAY LIKE THIS.
I KNOW IT'LL BE HARD TO GO BACK
AND FACE THEM, BUT...
I'M SURE IF YOU DO,
THEY'LL LISTEN THIS TIME,
MAKE IT RIGHT.
- THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE.
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
WHAT'S IT LIKE HAVING KIDS?
- IT'S SCARY...
BUT WORTH IT.
I CRIED LIKE A BABY
WHEN SHE WAS BORN.
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT.
I DON'T KNOW;
THEY FILL YOU WITH SOMETHING
YOU NEVER REALLY KNEW YOU NEEDED
OR WANTED.
AND NO ONE WILL EVER HUG YOU
LIKE YOUR OWN KID
WHEN YOU COME HOME
FROM WORK OR...
THEY HEAR A BUMP IN THE NIGHT.
THEY COME TO YOU FOR PROTECTION.
YOU GIVE 'EM A CUDDLE,
AND THEY GO STRAIGHT BACK
TO SLEEP,
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO STRONG--
AT LEAST, THEY THINK YOU ARE.
MAKES YOU FEEL IMPORTANT.
I REMEMBER THINKING
I WANTED TO TEACH HER
ALL OF LIFE'S LITTLE SECRETS,
ALL THOSE THINGS I KNEW
AND NO ONE ELSE DID,
WARN HER ABOUT BOYS.
I NEVER KNEW QUITE
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HER,
THAT'S FOR SURE.
SOMETIMES SHE'D LOCK HERSELF
IN HER ROOM,
WOULDN'T TALK TO ANYONE.
SHE GOT THAT FROM ME.
OTHER TIMES, SHE'D GO CRAZY
AND THROW PARTIES.
SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE
DRAMA QUEEN.
SHE GOT THAT FROM HER MOTHER.
WHAT REALLY SCARES ME,
THOUGH, IS,
I THINK SHE REALLY FELT ALONE.
THAT'S THE WORST THING
YOU CAN FEEL.
- DID YOU WANT
TO SCATTER HER SOMEWHERE?
- SOMEWHERE WITH WATER,
THE BEACH OR A RIVER.
NOW I JUST WANT TO DO IT,
GET IT OVER WITH.
CAN'T KEEP HER LOCKED UP
IN A POT.
- WE JUST PASSED A TURNOFF
FOR THE BEACH.
WHAT'S UP?
- NOTHING, JUST A CLIENT.
- HAVE YOU GOT MORE BUSINESS
OR SOMETHING?
- NO.
I'M FINISHED.
SO WHERE AM I DROPPING YOU?
- HOME.
- SHIT.
- WHAT?
- SORRY, I'M AWARE
I WAS SPEEDING.
- YOUR LICENSE.
KEEP YOUR HANDS
ON THE STEERING WHEEL.
- WHO'S TRAVELING WITH YOU?
- HER NAME'S--
- I'M TALKING TO HER.
MISS?
- UH, ALICE?
- DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?
- YEAH.
CAN YOU PLEASE STEP
OUT OF THE CAR, THANK YOU?
- WHY?
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
- GET OUT OF THE CAR.
SLOWLY.
AROUND THE FRONT.
MOVE ROUND THE FRONT OF THE CAR.
STAY THERE.
NOW GET OUT.
CLOSE THE DOOR.
UP AGAINST THE CAR.
TURN ROUND AGAINST THE CAR.
DON'T LOOK AT ME;
LOOK AT THE CAR.
CATCH THESE.
HANDCUFF HIS RIGHT WRIST.
- JUST DO WHAT HE SAYS.
- ALL RIGHT,
NOW HIS OTHER ONE.
ALL RIGHT, NOW MOVE OUT THE--
MOVE OUT THE WAY!
STOP THERE.
STOP THERE!
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST FOR THE
SUSPECTED MURDER OF SIX PEOPLE.
- WHAT?
- SHUT YOUR MOUTH!
ALL RIGHT.
TO MY CAR; COME ON.
MOVE IT.
DON'T LOOK AT ME!
MOVE.
COME ON!
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
TELL ME.
TELL ME!
- SOME MEN HURT JESSE.
- WHAT DID YOU DO?
- WHERE ARE YOU TAKING US?
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?
WHERE ARE WE?
DON'T FUCKING--
- GET OUT OF THE CAR!
- LEAVE HER ALONE!
LEAVE HER!
- NO, PLEASE!
- LET HER GO!
- G'DAY.
YOU MUST BE MR. FORTESKY.
HAVE YOU BEEN LOOKING FOR ME?
- NO.
- REALLY?
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.
- HIS WALLET, KEYS, KNIFE,
AND YOUR MATE'S MOBILE PHONE.
- YOU SHOULD'VE
GOTTEN RID OF THIS.
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED THE CONTACTS
I'VE GOT, RIGHT?
- OH, FUCK OFF.
- YEAH, YEAH.
JEEZ, YOUSE PIGS
ARE GETTING EXPENSIVE.
YOU HANGING AROUND
THIS TIME, HMM?
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE GIRL?
- WHAT?
- THE GIRL.
- YOU LIKE HER,
YOU DIRTY OLD PIG, HUH?
- DON'T FUCKIN' TOUCH ME.
- HANG ON TO HIM.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
- I'M TAKIN' MY CUFFS.
- WE'RE USING 'EM.
- WHAT, THE FOUR OF YOU
CAN'T HANG ON TO HIM?
- HOLD HIM.
HOLD HIM.
GIVE ME THE GIRL.
GIVE ME THE GIRL!
- PLEASE, SHE'S GOT NOTHING--
PLEASE, SHE'S GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH--
- SHE'LL BE FINE.
WE'RE LOVERS, NOT FIGHTERS.
- COME ON, I'VE GOT PLENTY OF--
I'VE GOT MONEY!
- REALLY?
- YES.
- HOW MUCH IS SHE WORTH?
- $10,000.
- YEAH?
- YES.
- HOW ABOUT $20,000?
- SURE.
- NOT BAD.
I THINK WE CAN SQUEEZE
A LITTLE MORE.
- HOW ABOUT $100,000?
- WE CAN GO TO THE BANK
TOMORROW.
ANYTHING, $100,000.
I CAN ARRANGE IT.
- YOU KNOW, I WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH JIM AND HIS BROTHER!
HUH?
SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKIN'?
I'M GONNA GET MY MONEY'S WORTH
OUT OF THE TWO OF YOUSE TONIGHT.
OH, YEAH.
GET THE ROPE AND TIE HIM UP,
CHUCK.
TAKE HIM DOWN.
- LITTLE PARTY?
- YEAH, MY BOY, DIG IN.
- GIVE ME THE ARMS.
- FUCK OFF!
FUCK OFF!
- LET'S GO, PLEASE.
- GET ON HIM.
- OH, FOR FUCK'S SAKE.
- GET YOUR ASS UP!
- HOLD HIM, CHUCK.
- HOLD HIM.
HOLD HIM!
YOU FUCKIN'--
- GET THE FUCK UP.
- WE DON'T EVEN SLEEP
IN THE SAME ROOM.
WHEN WE WATCH TELEVISION,
SHE WATCHES IT IN HER ROOM.
I WATCH IT IN MY ROOM.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH HER
FOR TWO YEARS.
A MAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO SLEEP
WITH HIS OWN WIFE.
WHY DOES--
FUCK!
- LEAVE HER THE FUCK ALONE!
- YOU OKAY?
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.
- COME HERE, YOU FUCKER!
- LOOK WHO'S WAKING UP.
HEY.
FUCK!
- CHARLES, JUST HANG ON.
HANG ON.
DO YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH OF A HEADACHE
THAT DEAD PIG'S GONNA BE?
HUH?
YOU FUCK WITH ONE,
AND THE REST COME AFTER YOU.
ANYWAY,
THIS LITTLE PRINCESS AND I
HAVE GOT TO GET READY.
GOT SOMEONE SPECIAL ON THEIR WAY
OVER HERE TO MEET HER.
HMM?
BEFORE WE GO...
WE MIGHT HAVE THAT LITTLE CHAT
ABOUT THAT SLAG DAUGHTER
OF YOURS.
YOU STILL WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED, RIGHT?
- I KNOW WHAT YOU DID TO HER.
- BUT YOU'VE BEEN MISSING OUT
ON ALL OF THE GOOD BITS.
SEE, SHE GOT A LITTLE UP TIGHT
BEFORE THE SHOOT.
BIT OF "H" SETTLED HER DOWN.
BUT SHE ASKED FOR IT.
HONEST.
DIDN'T GIVE A GOOD LOOK, THOUGH.
FINN WASN'T TOO HAPPY.
BUT SHE DIDN'T COMPLAIN.
NO.
IN FACT...
SHE WANTED A LITTLE TOPPER
BEFORE SHE LEFT.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HMM?
YEAH, WE HAD A LITTLE
PRIVATE TIME TOGETHER.
- OH, YEAH.
YOU HEARD ME.
- BUT HEY...
I HAD TO GIVE THE HOSPITAL
A CALL
RIGHT AFTER I DUMPED HER OFF.
SO THAT'S GOT TO BE WORTH
A COUPLE OF POINTS THERE.
IF IT MAKES ANY DIFFERENCE...
I DID FEEL PRETTY ROTTEN
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.
- NO!
- NOW...
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU
WITH CHUCK HERE.
AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO STAY
AND WATCH,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I REALLY DON'T LIKE VIOLENCE.
- COME ON, LOVE.
COME ON.
SEE YA.
ALONE AT LAST, EH?
MM.
OKAY.
NOW, YOU MIGHT FEEL
A SMALL PINCH, YEAH?
LET ME KNOW IF IT HURTS,
ALL RIGHT?
OKAY?
WAIT, WAIT.
STOP FUCKING MOVING.
OH, OH, WHOA, WHOA.
RIGHT.
NOW...
JUST LET ME
SEAL THAT UP FOR YOU.
- HEY.
- WHERE'S DEREK?
- HE'S IN THE SHED.
- WHERE?
- OVER THERE.
THERE.
- EVERYTHING SET UP?
- I DON'T KNOW, MATE.
IT'S UNLOCKED.
JUST POP YOUR HEAD IN.
- THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO THERE, EH?
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
UP WE COME.
UP WE COME.
GOOD BOY.
EH?
ALL RIGHT.
HANG ON A MINUTE.
EENIE...
MEENIE...
MINEY...
MOE.
LET'S MAKE A PIRATE OUT OF YOU.
READY?
ONE MINUTE.
SHE WANTS ME TO PICK UP
SOME CIGARETTES ON THE WAY HOME.
TRYING TO GET HER TO QUIT.
- LET HER HAVE 'EM.
- EH?
- THE BITCH'LL DIE QUICKER.
- IS THAT RIGHT?
YEAH?
THAT WAS A BIT RUDE, BUDDY.
TALKING ABOUT MY FUCKIN' LOVELY.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, YOU GO DOWN AGAIN.
YOU'RE FUCKIN' STAYING THERE,
ALL RIGHT?
I'M NOT POPPIN' A DISCOUNT
FOR YOU, OKAY?
WHERE WERE WE?
I BELIEVE IT WAS MOE.
COME HERE, YOU FUCK!
- OH, SHIT.
