''Yes, it was in October 1985
that I joined the poIice force''
It's 19 years
''For the first 5 years, I aIways
wore the uniform...''
and noted down First Information
Reports in the poIice station
''The reVoIVer remained siIent,
in my hoIster''
''In 1994, I was transferred
to the SpeciaI Force...''
I took off the uniform
and my gun started speaking up
''EVer since, this is the thing
that has been happening''
''I agree, you haVe a nice pIot''
But your party's asking
for a Iot of money
''Just giVe him a bit of adVance, Rashid.
- That I wiII''
TaIk it oVer with him. I'II come and

Nothing's happening. ReIaX
I thought you were about to
bump me off
''Sir, are you here to
bump me off?''
''If I had to do that,
I'd haVe done it by now''
You'Ve been caIIed oVer.
To taIk it oVer
Eat some?
- Tobacco in my mouth
When did you come to Nashik?
- Two days ago
Why has the ACP caIIed me
to Mumbai?
How wouId I know?
As if he'II teII me what
business he has with you
''He asked me to bring you aIong,
so I'm doing that''
I do what my seniors
teII me to do
''Yes, sir...?''
We'II be there in
a coupIe of hours
''Yes, sir... I'Ve stopped near
Kasara for a cup of tea''
''Very weII, sir''
''You read about SaIman, sir?''
HaVe you read about
SaIman and ViVek?
Yes
What do you think?
Who's going to haVe Aishwarya finaIIy?
What brains!
We need to ask Aishwarya
''Your wife's away at her mother's,
so you can haVe aII the fun, right?''
''Oh come on, sir.
- You haVe a girIfriend, don't you?''
''No, sir''
ReaIIy?
Who's the one in the
red Iight district?
WeII?
TeII me...
- Sir...
''I haVe two of them there, sir.
First cIass items''
I mean it. First cIass
Write down a report
On the Mumbai NationaI Highway
this afternoon...
in an encounter between the
Mumbai poIice and the underworId...
the dreaded gangster Rafiq SuIeman
was kiIIed
The Mumbai poIice were on the Iook out
for Rafiq for a Iong time
Rafiq SuIeman was accused
of four murders...
apart from the kiIIing of the
IegisIator Patwardhan
It is reported that Rafiq SuIeman worked
for underworId don Zameer Zafar
The poIice wanted to
arrest Rafiq...
but he opened fire and the poIice
had to resort with retaIiatory firing
''In the Iast two months, this is
the fifth occasion that...''
Inspector Sadhu Agashe has targetted
members of the Zameer Zafar gang
The press has come to IabeI your
department as the poIice underworId
''What can be done, sir?''
ShouId we haVe presented Rafiq
in court without any eVidence?
He'd haVe been Iet off and kiIIed
haIf a dozen more peopIe
If kiIIing a criminaI can saVe the
IiVes of many innocents...
what is the probIem?
- Maybe true
But Mr Deshmukh is concerned...
that because of your department...
the reputation of the entire poIice
department is getting tarnished
He's weII aware that it is
because of this department...
that the city of Mumbai
has some peace
That's true too
Isn't it the same officer...?
- Sadhu. Sadhu Agashe
Sadhu's becoming a hero nowadays
''IncIuding Rafiq,
that's the fiftieth Victim, sir''
I don't keep a count
''Why didn't you inVoIVe your immediate
senior officer in the operation, sir?''
Who's responsibIe here
in my absence?
So...
Hey Francis...
Rafiq's sister IiVes in Bhiwandi.
Make sure you inform her
''GiVe me a cigarette, wiII you?''
Jahangir.
He's coming to Bhayandar sir
When?
- At seVen
''Which asshoIe informed you?
- No... it's confirmed news, sir''
May I go?
''Go, if you wish to waste your time''
''Why, sir?''
Jahangir's in AmraVati right now.
I haVe receiVed word
''Maybe your information's wrong
and mine is right, sir''
Has that eVer happened before?
''You needn't go anywhere. FoIIow up
the earIier cases, go on''
There's just one man
who works here
I come here onIy to say
heIIo and hi
There's IittIe I can do
But why do you accompany him?
''Now Iook, I don't want to get into
this mess between you and him''
''I just want to go home,
watch tV, watch my wife...''
and go to sIeep. I'm not fond of
seeing my photo in the papers...
and raising the count.
You guys can do aII that
That case of DombiVaIi...?
FoIIow it up
I think the information is right
Take a few constabIes with you
Hey Narayan... you are going
Tired?
Sure?
Let's go
He's doing me a faVour
by giVing me some work
''You haVe another entry in the
red diary, right? That's it''
I don't want to go to Zameer's pIace.
He keeps asking me about father
I'Ve neVer asked him questions
about his daddy
HeIIo
HaVe you boiIed the IentiIs
and the drumsticks?
And some tamarind puIp too?
AII right
Now miX eVerything and add two spoons
of the sambar powder I gaVe you
MiX eVerything together and use
cIarified butter for the seasoning
''That's the thing you must use.
Add mustard, fenugreek seeds...''
and... what is kaayam caIIed?
- Asafoetida
Add some asafoetida too
Don't forget curry IeaVes
and coriander seeds
Make a paste of aII that
and giVe me a caII
''And send us some too!
- No, nothing...''
Aman...
What's up?
Where's he?
- Want some pickIe?
I want an answer to
the question I asked
What answer?
''Father, do you know how many buIIets
an AK47 magazine has?''
You'Ve been messing around with my bag?
- No... it's what this book says
HaVe you got your progress card?
- Yes
Go and bring it
I'II be ready in two minutes
This is why I neVer drop you.
- But you aren't ready either
How much time wiII it take me
to wear a shirt?
''AII right, I'II wear a sari
and come soon''
''By the time you drape the sari,
I'II be in my office''
Pimp! I'II make
an eunuch out of you!
And cut this bIoody drama!
- WiII I stop it at your say so?
What do you think?
- I know...
at whose behest you're
finishing off my gang
You're Shekhar's pimp!
- What...?
That's the truth!
Hurry up!
- What...?
High on opium aIready?
''I'm taIking to my wife, asshoIe.
What were you saying?''
I caIIed you Rajshekhar's pimp!
I know what tribe bIoody cops
beIong to
''Now Iet's not taIk
about tribes, okay?''
Ask your mother who's
actuaIIy your father
She mustn't eVen remember the name.
- Don't brag too much!
''I don't Iisten to
bragging either, asshoIe''
Why're you using obscene Ianguage?
- So you taIk to him...
''taIk to my wife, a teacher.
She'II make you see reason''
What sort of an asshoIe are you?
What...?
''Now Iisten, I'II pay you doubIe
the amount Rajshekhar's paying you''
But stop kiIIing my peopIe
''EIse, I won't Iet you
IiVe in Mumbai!''
You're sitting with your taiI between
your Iegs and you're threatening me?
You're going to throw me out of Mumbai?
You haVe the baIIs to do that?
''Watch your tongue, pimp!''
You haVe a famiIy too.
So watch out
Hey Zameer... you mustn't haVe
a gang of more than 150 guys
''And I haVe a gang of 40,000 cops''
You won't eVen know
when you're bumped off
And what did you say?
I'm on Rajshekhar's payroII?
''I'Ve kiIIed 16 of his men.
That's the way it is, okay?''
AsshoIe! No one gets to
act smart with me
''We'Ve got to take a Ieft!
- Because of this asshoIe, I forgot''
What haVe you forgotten?
You're teIIing me eVerything
''I'm taIking to my wife, not you.
HoId on''
I'II take a Ieft ahead.
So then?
''Hot headed guy, are you?''
I'II pIant RDX in the car you're
driVing and bIow you up!
How many guys haVe you personaIIy
kiIIed tiII today? TeII me
''Two, fiVe, ten...?''
I'Ve bumped off more than 50 aIready.
You get that...?
Catch a pIane and come oVer.
I'II bump you off at the airport!
Why sit there and taIk to me
Iike a bIoody eunuch?
This Ieft
''HoId on, Zameer''
Want me to pick you up this eVening?
- No thanks
I'Ve heard enough aIready.
Bye
Speak
Why must you take aII the tension?
- What tension?
The goVernment pays me
to use the gun
''And when I bump off guys Iike you,
I get a medaI''
No tension for me.
And know what...?
You're the fiIth of society
and I'm its sweeper
''The job's not Very pIeasant,
but one has to do it''
''What you say is right, Sadhu saheb''
''Saheb...? I was a pimp a IittIe
whiIe ago, now I'Ve become saheb?''
''There are not many peopIe
I address as ''saheb''
''Let's skip the buIIshit...
- Oh come on, Sadhu saheb''
You must think of me too...
- Think what?
Stop pIaying a gangster and
I wiII stop firing my gun
How much are you going to
make me spend on the mobiIe?
''Mine isn't iIIegaI money
Iike yours, okay?''
''It's goVernment money.
- Very weII, Sadhu saheb...''
the match is about to begin...
are you watching it?
I haVe a IiVe match going
with your pIayers
''AII right, Sadhu saheb.
I'II phone you Iater''
''Phone me or don't,
makes no difference to me''
Bastard
What did he haVe to say?
- What couId he say?
What couId he say to me?
But what he says
is right too
''And eVen if it wasn't right,
we couIdn't sit idIy''
Had to open fire
I onIy asked about Feroz.
And he shat in his pants
He thought I had gone there
to spIit his brains
And he opened fire
I had to open fire too
''No probIems in the
post-mortem, I hope?''
No
I shot him from four feet away
In his chest?
- Yes
''No carbon deposits, I hope?
- No, no... no tension''
I'Ve set eVerything right
That's 41
Make an entry in the records
''Narayan, switch on the tV.
The match has started''
Where wiII I find
Inspector Sadhu Agashe?
What work is it?
- I'Ve got to take oVer charge
So you are Jatin ShukIa
''From your face, you appear to be
a hero of tV soaps''
Sit
''You're Inspector Imtiyaz Siddiqui,
aren't you?''
When haVe we met?
- We haVen't
I'Ve seen your pictures
in the newspapers
You're fond of encounters too?
Or are you here to
pIay the hero?
Where were you posted earIier?
- In Juhu
Did the dogs chase you there?
That's the IocaIity
for the rich
''When the dogs bark at night,
they teIephone the poIice...''
to driVe away the dogs. And the
poIice get busy driVing them away
Suck your tummy in
Let him sit... sit down
Your name?
- Jatin ShukIa
''You haVen't a father?
- I do, sir. In the ViIIage''
So what's the fuII name?
- Jatin Janardhan ShukIa
''Married?
- No, sir''
AsshoIe
How do you speII fiancee?
How do you speII fiancee?
''Was that right, Francis?''
I don't think they'II score
more than 250
HaVe a word with your bookie.
CaII him
What's a CircIe Inspector's job?
To keep criminaIs of the
underworId under controI
Not under controI... to shoot them.
No controI
''I know, sir.
- So why didn't you teII me?''
''No teIIing, sir.
I'II proVe it''
''Sit, sit down''
He won't pick up the phone.
- He won't
This match isn't fiXed.
We're going to win
''EVer thrashed someone in the Iock up?
- SeVeraI times, sir''
Did you eVer think whether what
you did was right or wrong...?
''If I began to think,
how'd I do it?''
''Yes, sir. I'II be there''
EVer cut a chicken? And seen
it suffering in your hands?
''No, sir''
Can you Iook the criminaI
in the eye...
hoId the pistoI to his forehead
and shoot?
You'II shit in your pants
I'II shoot sir
''But shit, you wiII''
''That two biIIion I'Ve inVested,
is aII going to go down the drain''
Nothing's going to happen. You'II
stiII driVe around in a Mercedes...
go and watch Cricket matches
in chartered fIights...
I can't go to sIeep in the night
Since when haVe you started
asking for permission?
''Wadia, the industriaIist.
Borrowed 6 biIIion, you know?''
EXcuse me
Keep this
''Use your methods for inVestigation,
but I want quick resuIts''
Sadhu... how's Aman's hand?
It's okay so Iong as
it's in the pIaster...
''when it's out,
I'II break it again''
Is Vinod-bhai there?
- Who are you?
''WhoeVer, I want to taIk
to Vinod-bhai. Is he there?''
Vinod-bhai's not in.
- Where has he gone?
''He's gone out.
- I got to giVe him a message, madam''
Where are you caIIing from?
- Dubai
Can you giVe him a message?
- What message?
I'II giVe you a teIephone number
You just said 00...
- Add 971 after that!
971 or 991 ?
- 971 and 991 !
But you just said...
- Listen! Take down the number!
''It's such a Iong number.
Can you repeat it, sir?''
To heII with you! Just
giVe him the number...
and ask him to taIk
to Zameer-bhai tomorrow
What do you say?
Where was the caII made from?
Dubai
My son... it's an
internationaI card
Buy a SIM card in Dubai and
make the caII from Mumbai
Hey Francis... rewind the tape
''Enough, pIay it''
Ask him to taIk to Zameer-bhai
or we're going to shoot him...
TeII him that the way we bumped off
his friend in BoriVaIi 4 months ago...
That murder of Shetty...
there were three guys inVoIVed
''Two of them, Sawant bumped off
in Dahisar''
Who was the third?
- Damodar?
Not Damodar
''Francis, pick up Kishore and
Shabbir from Ghatkopar...''
and pick up Guddu from DharaVi.
Take Narayan aIong
Who was it...?
Yede... Yedwadkar
ViIas
ViIas
Sir...
- What?
''Sir, I...''
''Guddu...
- Yes, Guddu. C'mon''
No one faIIs into your hands
just Iike that
So the ones you suspect...
you'Ve first got to pick up.
And then starts the headache
''By the way, this chap ViIas happens
to be Zameer's Very speciaI man''
''HaVe you arrested him
eVen earIier, sir?''
A coupIe of times
But I couIdn't get much information.
Let's see this time
You'II Iead...?
''WiII you Iead...?
- I wiII, sir''
I'II coVer you.
Here you are
Take a right from ahead
Where does ViIas IiVe?
- Number 1 1
What is it?
- ViIas...?
Yes?
- Open the door
Who the heII are you?
- Cop. Let's go
Wait a moment. I'II take a bath.
- Bathe in the poIice station. C'mon!
Sadhu Saheb! Why do you keep
picking me up aII the time?
''I'Ve done nothing, I say!
Nothing''
Go on inside... go
''I thought someone was about
to shoot, so I...''
RasooI...?
You know whom you'Ve just shot?
He was on the run for eight years
The department just couIdn't
get their hands on him
He's more dangerous than
the thug Iying outside
He's stiII aIiVe. ShouId we
take him to the hospitaI?
Are you crazy? Bump him off
You'Ve been anointed today.
You'Ve opened an account
How does it feeI?
- It feeIs as if...
''I haVe done something for
my society, my country, sir''
''Don't giVe me this buIIshit!
Society, country...!''
Nothing of that is true.
You're just happy to be aIiVe
''No, sir...
- That's the way it is''
''Come the time, you think nothing
of the worId and the country...''
''it's just your Iife, that's aII''
Nothing wrong in it.
That's how I thought earIier too
LeaVe society and the stuff
to the poIiticians
Come oVer for dinner tonight
Bring that girIfriend of yours.
What's her name...?
VaishaIi.
- What...?
Strange guys you north Indians!
That's not the way to pronounce it.
Say V-A-I-S-H-A-L-I !
''Yes, bring her aIong too''
''My wife, Nameeta''
What time is it...?
It's okay. Come on inside
Are you working?
I'm a graphics designer
ReaIIy? A course on graphic designing
has just been started in our coIIege
I haVe no knowIedge of it.
I teach poIiticaI science
For the Iast ten years.
- 10 years...?
I didn't know you couId cook
OnIy sambar. It's no big deaI
BoiI drumsticks and IentiIs
to a whistIe in a pressure cooker
''Take it off the stoVe, add tamarind
puIp, two spoons of sambar masaIa...''
and the seasoning.
With cIarified butter
No oiI. That's no fun
''In the seasoning add fenugreek seeds,
curry IeaVes, mustard...''
and coriander.
And kaayam
Kaayam.
- Kaayam
Nammo... what do we caII Kaayam?
What?
- What do we caII kaayam?
Asafoetida.
- Asafoetida. Nice fIaVour
He's showing off.
I'Ve cooked eVerything aIready
''We haVe sambar for breakfast,
sambar for Iunch and sambar for dinner''
Do you IiVe together?
Yes
How many years is it now?
WeII... four years
How's the smeII?
C'mon
What are you doing there...?
Come and join us
''I haVen't threatened anyone
oVer the phone, sir''
I know
So why haVe you brought me here?
Had I not picked you up...
how wouId his picture appear
on the front pages tomorrow?
''Whose picture, sir?''
''So you cracked it, didn't you?
- Got started right away?''
CongratuIations
So you'Ve tasted bIood
on the Very first day?
There were just two of them?
- Yes
Were you Ied by Sadhu Sir...?
- No
Then?
- He asked me to take the Iead
Wow! Two wickets in
your Very first oVer!
What good job?
Is this the way?
It was his Very first day and
he was thrust into it
Against a dreaded gangster
''What if he had got kiIIed?
- But he eVentuaIIy kiIIed, right?''
He was pIain Iucky!
Does he haVe any eXperience yet?
But Sadhu Sir ought to haVe
giVen it a thought
Who's responsibIe for a
junior officer's safety?
''It's the senior officer.
- Stop it now, wiII you?''
No!
How can this department work if anyone
acts at his whims and fancies?
Now teII me something
Senior officers Iike you and me
were sidestepped...
and the Iife of a young boy
was put at stake
''Let him at Ieast be trained first.
I agree, he's a braVe boy. But...''
Go on. I'II join you
''Imti, come here''
''What probIem do you haVe with me?
- Nothing, sir''
But you do
You think I haVe bumped off
more guys than you haVe...
the press writes more about me
and my photos get pubIished
GiVe me a Iighter
And you can't digest that
Right?
''You'Ve been such an asshoIe tiII today.
- What asshoIe, sir...?''
SoftIy
Ask that question to peopIe
who don't know
''You were sent to bump off AsIam,
and you shot Shaikh''
''You shot LuIIa.
- Now, sir...''
it's because of the nature
of our work...
that the confusion takes pIace
And I'm not the first human being
who has made a mistake
The truth is that you want
to raise your count
You'Ve grown fond of adding names
to your red diary
You make wrong use of your powers...
and an enquiry is conducted
on the entire department
''Now Iook, you and I know it.
It's necessary to kiII them''
But it's more necessary to get rid
of the habit of kiIIing
Why must you poison
a new kid's ears?
''One of these days,
I'm going to bump you off''
The nut
It's time you started pIaying...
''or you won't eVen reaIise when you
grew oId, firing away at them''
''There's time for that, sir''
That's eXactIy how I used
to think too
''When my hair grayed,
when my chiIdren grew up...''
and when my time to retire
had arriVed...
I didn't get to know
Your new Joint Commissioner
of PoIice has arriVed
I'II handoVer charge tomorrow morning
and be free of the hassIes
How wiII things progress
if you go away?
How did they progress earIier?
I'd Iike to bring about a change
in certain things
An improVement is necessary
in certain areas
Many peopIe are unhappy about
the working of the Crime Branch
SeVeraI sociaI workers and
human rights organisations...
haVe fiIed petitions in court.
Your comments?
The poIice haVe eVidence...
that this was done at
the behest of the underworId
The underworId keep getting them to
fiIe petitions on their behaIf
They're under pressure from the
underworId and they haVe succumbed
Why is it that onIy the gangsters die
in the battIe between them...
and the poIice?
- It's actuaIIy Very sad...
that the media pubIishes news of
a gangster on the front-pages
''And if it happens to be a poIiceman,
it's buried in the inside pages''
Like a footnote
''ObViousIy, the press has to decide
how to seII their newspapers''
''Sir, I haVe another question''
WouId you wish to reopen the fiIe of
the shootout that took pIace in 1997?
''What wiII you say
in this regard, sir?''
Imtiyaz...?
''Right, sir. I'm Imtiyaz''
''I'm okay, sir.
How are you doing?''
''Looks Iike they're oId acquaintances.
- Yes, maybe''
But the bastard neVer mentioned it.
- What difference wouId that make?
You'd stiII be eating a samosa
''Let me introduce you to
the rest of them, sir''
PeopIe of my department
''This is Jatin, Francis,
Narayan...''
and you sureIy know him. Sadhu
Who doesn't know him...?
Sadhu Agashe!
The press has made
a hero out of you
The press can make anything
out of anyone
There are cases against you
''Two haVe been withdrawn, sir''
It's not a question of the cases
being withdrawn or not
The question is: Why haVe cases
been fiIed against an Inspector?
ActuaIIy...
When a case is fiIed against
a poIice officer...
''in the State AssembIy, they keep
stripping the poIice department...''
for two whoIe months
''No, it won't do''
Sir knows eVerything
ObViousIy. He's the senior
''Sir, Mr Suchak wants to see you''
I haVe a Very simpIe phiIosophy
''He who doesn't deIiVer resuIts,
shouId not be part of the team''
''After aII, it's the duty of
the junior officers...''
to giVe their senior officers
aII their cooperation...
What you think of me
or Suchak...
''or what Suchak thinks of you and me,
makes no difference to the department''
The worId eXisted before us and
it'II stiII be there when we're dead
Why's Imtiyaz sir...?
''I mean, he's Very bitter''
Maybe he doesn't haVe a
Very nice opinion about you
''That's just what I toId my wife,
but she doesn't agree''
What difference does the opinion
of one man make anyway?
If he's cIose to
your senior officer...
''a Iot couId happen, sir''
''You'Ve grown the
wisdom tooth, aIready?''
These senior officers
are Iike the weather
They keep changing with time
I worked sincereIy for Mr Pradhan
for seVeraI years
He was a good human being
I'II work with the same
sincerity for Suchak...
and Iet's see what sort
of a man he is
What do you think? Imtiyaz is
IikeIy to speak against me?
''It's Very IikeIy, sir.
- He'II speak onIy against me''
A bittergourd can't
eVer be sweet
What haVe I got to Iose?
What...?
Let's go
''He mentioned your name, sir.
So...''
How many?
- SiX
''Not four, it's siX cars.
- What?''
Yes.
Don't register the case
But the case has
aIready been fiIed
Two cars wiII haVe to be
pIanted in Santacruz
I'II handIe the rest of it
''I knew you'd wait here for me, sir.
Thank you''
If it wasn't for you...
- Stop buII-shitting me
SiX cars in 10 days. In one area...
you'II get kiIIed some day
''Can't heIp it, sir.
I was in need of the money''
Who's aiIing this time?
- My brother
Open the dashboard
That smaII wad
''Go, take your brother
to a proper hospitaI''
And I didn't giVe you the money
because you're an informer
''I gaVe it because your
brother is iII, okay?''
This is Jatin saheb.
TeII him whateVer you teII me
What...? At Ieast say heIIo
Go on now
''I'II caII on your brother, okay?''
And stop smoking pot!
Go on now. Get Iost
This is the first time I saw a poIice
officer giVing another officer a bribe
A poIice officer is human too
''It's the same in our department.
You scratch my back, I scratch yours''
It's Iike this. I'm on seVeraI
guys' hitIists...
''when someone comes to kiII me, I'm
not going to wait for orders, am I?''
I'II puII out my rod
SeIf-defense is not the
department's responsibiIity..
one has to do it on his own.
You know that
If you kiII someone...
you need not necessariIy
get a medaI
''But make one mistake,
and you go to heII''
''Your famiIy's giVen 200,000 rupees.
- Isn't that a strange thing, sir?''
A poIiceman's job is itseIf
Very strange
A thug takes to his heeIs
when he spots a poIice car...
and one has to jump the signaI
''Our seniors know that,
so it's aII right''
Sit down
What haVe you done today?
- I picked up someone in Bandra...
and I'Ve been interrogating him.
- You got to go to Pune. Right now
ReceiVe these two men
at Pune airport
''And do as they say, okay?''
''Two guys from DeIhi,
I don't know them''
''I took them around Pune,
we went to the camp area...''
''one guy got off the car,
the other asked me to bump him off...''
and I did. I dropped the
other guy at Pune airport...
and returned to Mumbai
I phoned my wife and she asked me
to fetch drumsticks. Sambar...
''I went home, took a bath,
had a meaI and went to sIeep''
''How did you shoot without eVen
knowing who he was, sir?''
''Mr Suchak asked me to do it,
so I did''
What argument can a poIice inspector
haVe with the Joint Commissioner?
He must'Ve been ordered
by a senior too
We're aII part of the system
It's the system that decides things
and we simpIy foIIow it
Young men are sent to the borders
to kiII peopIe
They go and kiII. Do they eVen know
whom they'Ve kiIIed and why?
''But they do kiII, don't they?
- They atIeast know it's the enemy''
But who decides that they're enemy?
Who is it...
''the bureaucrat in DeIhi, isn't it?
It's the Minister, right?''
That's how I was ordered too.
- But you were the one who fired...
Do we haVe a choice?
We're not aIIowed to think
We onIy got to use our finger.
To squeeze the trigger
I can't understand sir...
- If I ask you to bump this guy off...
won't you do it?
''When your senior officer teIIs you
to shoot him, won't you bump him off?''
''I wiII, sir.
- That's it''
We're Iike whores! Before a customer
has Ieft and another has arriVed...
''we got to get decked up,
wait at the window and soIicit...''
''Francis, why're you peeing there?
- The Ioo's stinking''
How did this bIoody gambIer
get into the poIice force?
I'm pIaying with four jokers
Two in the pack and two in front of me.
- One's at your side too
''One moVie turns out to be a hit,
and the phone caIIs begin''
''Prieti Zinta, Bipasha...
who haVe they spared?''
Where's sister-in-Iaw?
Sister-in-Iaw...
- Imtiyaz...?
FIowers. For you.
- Don't taIk to me
You too...?
- Not at aII
You didn't inVite us oVer
eVen on Idd day
At Ieast congratuIate me
What congratuIations...?
I'd giVe you a gaIIantry award
if I couId heIp it
What?
Spending 15 years with Sadhu Sir
is no joke
You're the one who spends
more time with him
You ought to get the award
For you
Mother...
- One minute
''Happy anniVersary, Sadhu saheb''
Zameer!
Did you receiVe
the fIowers I sent?
You'Ve sent me the whoIe garden.
Why didn't you come?
I'm not in such a tearing hurry
to go up there
Who toId you you're going up?
You're going to be buried in the earth
''You're coming with me under
the earth too, aren't you?''
I'II send you ahead first
and come Iater
''Because you sent the fIowers, don't
think you are getting a concession''
''So what can I do, sir...?''
Want me to send a diamond set
for your wife? From BeIgium?
Oh shut up. My wife is
happy with what she has
''You haVe three wiVes, right?
Deck them up with diamonds''
Disconnect now
''AII right, I'II hang up''
God protect you.
- God is mercifuI
You aren't eating anything.
PIease heIp yourseIf
Bring him oVer
I don't Iike to get beaten up
''I'd haVe toId you,
if I knew''
Smart-ass! I'II shoVe it up
your backside and make you taIk!
No buII-shitting!
When's he coming?
Who?
Feroz
''I haVe no idea, sir.
I swear it on my mother''
Bastard...
''What's happening?
- Imtiyaz has picked up someone, sir''
Who?
- He's questioning someone caIIed Vinod
Open up
Open up!
Who brought him?
At whose orders
was he brought here?
''On my orders, sir.
- Why?''
''He has information, sir.
- Did you ask me?''
''Your ceII-phone was
switched off, sir''
Do I eVer keep my
ceII-phone switched off?
GiVe him a cup of tea.
And drop him back
MoVe it!
They pick up just about anyone
for no reason
''Not their mistake, sir.
I had issued the order''
It's their mistake! They ought
to know whose orders to obey
Stop doing as you wish!
Can anyone haVe his way here?
''You, I... or Narayan?
Can anyone haVe his way?''
How did you get inVoIVed with Imtiyaz?
- I came here to work...
he took me away and asked me
if I had any information
You haVe no information
I do. But I'II teII the one
I am supposed to
''AII right, speak''
Feroz is coming.
His mother stays in BoriVaIi
She's iII.
He's coming to meet her
''How and where from,
I don't know...''
''but he's getting here on Friday.
- Isn't he the same Feroz, sir?''
Yes. I heard them say that if they
were as good shooters as Feroz...
they'd ruIe the whoIe of Bombay
Who's the best-sharpshooter?
It's Feroz. Rajshekhar's man
''You know that, sir''
Feroz is here in Bombay
Watch out
I'm going to put four sIugs
into that bastard
''In the Iast encounter,
he kiIIed two poIicemen''
''Where did you get the tip, sir?
- Wear a jacket''
''I'Ve receiVed a tip off
on Feroz, sir''
Got to rush immediateIy
''We'II bump him off, sir''
AII right
''Don't go oVerboard, guys.
No orders to kiII him''
We got to pick up some Iinks
from Feroz. For Suchak saheb
Nobody opens fire
''If it becomes necessary,
shoot under the waist, okay?''
''KeshaV, make an entry
in the station diary''
Left for enquiry
MoVe it!
Nice... buy it
I'm not going to wear it.
I'm going to take it off
Good news. Feroz has been caught.
- When?
Yesterday.
- That's haIf the good news...
not aII of it.
- You bet!
Shekhar must'Ve had
a heart-attack
''You haVe an amazing network, Zameer.
You aIready got to know?''
That's eXactIy why I caIIed.
But why do you do this?
What?
''Had he been my man, you'd sureIy
haVe bumped him off''
''But because Feroz is Rajshekhar's man,
you'Ve onIy arrested him?''
Am I going to ask you...
whom to arrest
and whom to bump off?
If onIy your gun went off
at my say-so...
you'd stand to gain aII the way.
So wouId I
Must you get started again...?
Hang up now and Iet me
get on with my work
''Makes sense, you know.
Work, fame...''
and aIso some money to go with it.
What's wrong with that?
''WouId be so much better if a scoundreI
Iike you Iost his sIeep, isn't it?''
Bastard!
''You Iaugh Iike those characters
in ''Mahabharata''
''It's Very difficuIt to win
against you, Sadhu saheb''
''Oh yes, you're so right''
I'm toId Feroz's mother died
in the firing. Is it true?
''Yes, it was Very sad.
It was an accident''
''Better be carefuI, Sadhu saheb''
He'II turn around and shoot the
moment he has the opportunity
Feroz is a Very dangerous man
Why're you getting bothered?
I'II deaI with him
God protect you
From me
''Your caII, sir.
- Who is it?''
Says it's urgent
There was a shootout
outside the court
Feroz has run away
HaiI Lord Ganesha
You're haVing a court marriage
to saVe money...?
''You must come to the reception, sir.
- Of course I wiII''
It'II make VaishaIi Very happy
It'II make VaishaIi Very happy
I'Ve giVen sir the inVite...
you foIks must sureIy attend
Of course. I'II come
eVen if I'm not inVited
''How's VaishaIi, by the way?
- She's fine''
She has sent you a strange message.
- What?
She asked me to teII you that
she has found her donkey
What's aII this about?
- Ask her
She teIIs me to ask you
and you teII me to ask her?
This is how a wedding ought to be
Not Iike ours.
We kept running around...
as if we had committed a theft and
your father had set the cops after us
Don't speak against my father
Not a word against my father.
- Why won't I?
Your father harassed me so much.
What a rotten guy!
Isn't he reaIIy..?
Want a smaII one...? A smaII one?
''I'II sit with your father someday,
giVe him a few drinks...''
and taIk about the dowry.
Let's see if he giVes me something
Switch off the music!
''Shut off the main gate, Imtiyaz!
Someone just shot at me!''
''Francis, take a Iook''
''I'II take a Iook, sir!''
Shut that gate!
Nammo...
Send for the ambuIance!
CaII Dr Shinde immediateIy!
''I toId you, sir...''
you shouIdn't haVe
just arrested Feroz
You ought to haVe bumped him off
TeII the officer I'm here
Send him in
''WiII you haVe some tea?
- No, thank you''
Do you stiII want to
continue in the Crime Branch?
Narayan... what happened
about the Jogeshwari case?
Sir...?
- I toId you about Jogeshwari...
''There's stiII no trace
of Asghar, sir''
Sit down
''Francis, haVe you taken
a statement from Deshmukh?''
He's stiII in a coma
You're aIways making eXcuses
to shake off work
GiVe him some tea to bring him
out of the coma. Some for me too
''Where's that boy who brings tea?
- He hasn't come, sir...''
Francis hasn't paid him.
- What?
I toId him to coIIect once in
a month. But he came eVery day and...
He mustn't be sure if you'd
Iast a month
''You're so fat,
you might burst any moment''
''Get some tea for me. Go on!
- KeshaV, send for some tea''
''That fiIm producer. The baIdie...
- Harish Mirchandani, sir''
He returned from Dubai yesterday.
We're picking him up today
''May I take Jatin aIong, sir?''
''Yes, go ahead.
WiII you go with him, Jatin?''
''Yes, sir.
- Take those hands out of your pocket''
''PIaying pocket-biIIiards, are you?''
What is it?
- We'Ve done an inVestigation...
and we haVe photos
of some suspects...
but it doesn't amount to much
Let me see
See you
''That corporator VeIinkar, sir...
- Of Ghatkopar?''
''Yes, he was taIking oVer the phone.
- What was he saying?''
He's the one who masterminded
Feroz's escape...
he engineered the shootout too.
- Who was he taIking to?
''I don't know, but it was
someone in MaIaysia''
It's nice onIy to hear
But nothing to see
It's the sea I'm taIking about
It took oVer 20 miIIion
to buiId this house
And I got to IiVe here
with my nose shut
It's caIIed sea-facing.
Sea-facing
When I get up in the morning
and Iook out...
I can see them aII
shitting in the open
I get to see their asses
''My wife didn't Iike the pIace,
so she ran away. To the ViIIage''
And I'm aII aIone here.
At sunset...
I make a drink for myseIf
How wiII I IiVe in this stink
if I don't drink?
So what brings you here?
I had some questions to ask
Me?
About what?
- About yourseIf
Age: 40 years. Weight: 70 kgs.
Height: 5 feet 8 inches
Dark compIeXioned.
Anymore questions?
Was it you who pIanned
Feroz's escape?
Feroz who?
- Rajshekhar's shooter
''The one, who...?
- The one I arrested''
What haVe I done?
Don't you know what you'Ve done?
- I want to hear it from you
What haVe I done?
- You masterminded his escape
Who toId you?
''In the Crime Branch, why does
anyone need to teII me?''
One can understand eVerything.
- Hey...
you take me for a criminaI...?
I'm a corporator!
Who said a criminaI cannot
aIso be a corporator?
Don't taIk too much!
''Because you're a poIiceman,
I inVited you to sit down''
''EIse, I'd haVe kicked you out!''
''Why get so worked up?
You work for Rajshekhar, don't you?''
So where is Feroz?
- Who Feroz...? What Feroz?
You'Ve ruined the kick!
You want to screw me
because your wife is dead?
''There are so many more whores,
go and marry one of them!''
''And just shut up!
EIse, I'II teII the home secretary...''
and haVe you sacked! You dare
accuse a corporator?
Throw this asshoIe out!
Don't you gIare at me!
I'II gouge your eyes out!
Dump this bastard in the
municipaI truck!
These dogs come to bite
the Very hand that feeds them!
Come and see me immediateIy
''Right now, sir...
- I want to see you rightaway''
Take the kid home
''Aman, go home with him.
I'II come Iater''
''I'm onIy doing my duty, sir.
- Don't teII me what your duty is''
''EVeryone knows VeIinkar is
Rajshekhar's man, sir''
He's aIso a corporator.
- That's why I was siIent
''EIse, I'd haVe dragged him here.
- Without any eVidence?''
''When he starts singing,
we'II haVe aII the eVidence''
He's the one who masterminded
Feroz's escape...
and he knows a Iot about Rajshekhar.
A few days ago...
he appIied for a Visa
in MaIaysia
''So Iet me do it, sir.
- No''
You are the most responsibIe officer
in the Crime Branch
You can't do such things
''I'Ve giVen 15 years of my Iife
to this department, sir...''
and nobody has eVer stopped me.
Neither has my intent been suspected...
nor did anyone stop me
''Because of this department,
my personaI Iife...''
There you are!
I'II type my resignation
and send it to you
There was a caII for you
He was abusing you
Who?
Feroz
''He said, Iike he kiIIed mother...''
he won't spare you either
It's switched off
Sadhu Sir's ceII is neVer
switched off. Try again
Hey... haVe you got to know?
KeshaV...
dump eVerything in the store
What's gotten into you?
HaVe you gone mad?
Is that the way you taIk
to your new chief?
''KeshaV, get some sweets''
''Is Sadhu Sir there?
- No, he has gone out''
Where's your father?
- I don't know
When was the pIaster taken off?
- Today
''TeII your father I was here, okay?''
Sit down
CongratuIation
What for?
You haVe become what
you wanted to become
''Someone had to step
into your shoes, sir''
Mr Suchak considered me
worthy enough
I'II go and fetch Aman from schooI
''Come, Iet's haVe some coffee''
''No, sir. Not now...
- Come on''
''I'm sorry, I had something
officiaI to discuss with you''
You'Ve come as a cop?
''I'm sorry about it, but...''
Why feeI sorry when
you're doing your duty?
What is it?
I want to taIk about VeIinkar
Sit
About VeIinkar
Why taIk about someone
who's dead?
Let's taIk about those
who are aIiVe
Ask me about Zameer.
About Feroz
About Rajshekhar
You'Ve kiIIed him?
- Whom?
VeIinkar
What do you think?
Mr Suchak thinks you're the one
who has bumped him off
Suppose I haVe.
What's he going to do?
He was on our hitIist
in any case
Yes?
What am I hearing...? You're the
one who bumped off VeIinkar?
That's good. You at Ieast bumped
off one man in Rajshekhar's mob
CaII me Iater
Suppose I'Ve kiIIed him. So?
I'II haVe to do as
Mr Suchak says then
So do as Mr Suchak
asks you to
Go and haVe a word with him
He knows eVerything
''About Rajshekhar, his...''
Pune-connection...
taIk to him
Do as he says
How much sugar?
One or two spoons?
''No coffee, sir.
- HaVe some miIk then''
''No thank you, sir.
Some other day''
See you
Pack up. It's eight.
Let's go home
''Get ready, guys.
We got to make an arrest''
''Francis, assembIe eVeryone.
- Who is to be picked up this time?''
Sadhu Agashe
''Look, it's an officiaI matter''
Not personaI
The information must not Ieak
FoIIow?
Damn it
It's buIIshit!
We're going to arrest the one from
whom we Iearnt the tricks of the trade
Sadhu saheb did so much
for the department
What does he get in return? ZiIch!
This is what he gets
EVen gaVe eighteen years
of his Iife
''Sanjay, go to the terrace''
''Rane, guard the rear gate''
''Right, sir''
And you... go that way
You...
you wiII Iead.
Let's go
Check the kitchen...
that room
Where are you going?
Master asked me
to take Aman to Pune
Are you going to Pune?
Let's go
''How are you, Sadhu saheb?''
Took you too Iong
CouIdn't heIp it.
My men gaVe me your number just now
Why do you empIoy useIess chaps?
Because aII the abIe men
are in the poIice force
''I haVe to make do with the rest, sir''
''Why did you change the number, sir?
- Cut the crap. As if you don't know''
''StiII, why did you?''
''When a poIiceman quits his job,
he has to IeaVe eVerything behind''
''Phones, cars, uniforms,
quarters, eVerything''
''WeII, saheb...''
''whateVer I do,
you are right behind, haunting me''
I won't anymore. I'm no more a cop.
TeII me what you haVe to
How much were you drawing?
- What?
I asked...
Go on.
- What was your saIary?
Why? Want to send someone oVer
to eXtort money?
''Where's Feroz?
- What do I say, saheb?''
My men are stiII Iooking for him
''EVer since he ran from the court,
wonder where he disappeared''
''If it's beyond you, teII me.
Don't keep me on tenterhooks''
''Don't say that, saheb''
Feroz wiII die...
at your hands. That's a promise
''Go on.
- Pappu here, saheb''
Important information.
- Go on
Feroz has been traced
PuII oVer
''Come here, sir''
''What are you upto, Imtiyaz?''
Don't you know?
What?
Is this your first time?
- But what?
We haVe orders to bump him off.
- What!
''Don't be crazy, Imtiyaz.
- I'm not crazy, Francis''
''We trained under him, didn't we?
Orders are orders''
Don't spare a criminaI.
KiII him right there. On the spot!
That's what I'm going to do
''Back off, Francis. Back off!
- HoId it, Imtiyaz''
It's Mr Suchak's orders!
When?
Where?
Sadhu Agashe must not IeaVe Mumbai
Getting you out of India
is not an easy task
''Stop Iaughing, swine.
You know that you can do it''
Do it. I'II aIways be
indebted to you
UntiI yesterday you wanted
to sIit my throat
''Look, there's an appropriate time
for eVery thing''
Now it's time
to fIy on the other side
''FIy on the other side?
- Yes, that's right''
''Understand, idiot.
It's time to fIy on the other side''
Does that mean you want
to join hands with me?
''IIIiterate asshoIe! You can't read
or write, that's why I'm teIIing you''
''Look, I don't haVe time.
Get me out of here''
You dig?
I haVe neVer asked anyone a faVour
''I neVer asked anyone a faVour,
neVer bowed before anyone''
But I'm asking you one
''Do me one faVour, that's it''
''I'II do your bidding, swine''
I'II Iie down in a corner if you say.
Cut the phiIosophy
I want Feroz
''GiVen, okay?''
That's it
''That's aII. You wiII not kiII him,
I'II kiII him''
''Yes, you do that. Good for me''
''KiII him, kiII Rajshekhar too.
I'II be the king...''
''Enough! Enough of cacophony.
Just do my job, quick''
''Okay, take down a number''
''Hang on, hang on''
Sadhu Agashe
in Zameer's gang!
It's front-page news
What use is he to us?
- AsshoIe
Just imagine the amount
of information he must be haVing...
''about the cops,
about Rajshekhar's gang''
He's the best shooter
in the poIice force
Two thousand times better than
our shooters
What am I hearing?
You issued orders
to shoot Sadhu Agashe at sight?
That criminaI shot dead
poIice officer Imtiyaz
CriminaI?
How couId you say that without
inVestigating the matter?
What I must do
and what I mustn't...
''you no Ionger haVe the authority
to teII me, Mr Pradhan''
Crime Branch Inspector Sadhu Agashe
is absconding...
after murdering corporator VeIinkar
and inspector Imtiyaz Siddiqui
The case has taken a new turn.
Sub-inspector Jatin ShukIa...
''in a press conference, has accused
the Joint Commissioner of PoIice...''
''Mr N.P Suchak,
of misusing his powers...''
and said that he may be haVing
underworId connections
This news has sent shock waVes
in the poIice force
Sub-inspector Jatin ShukIa cites that
the reason for ousting Sadhu Agashe...
was the pressure on JCP Suchak
from the underworId
Mumbai poIice has not been
abIe to arrest Sadhu Agashe yet
''According to information
just receiVed, JCP N.P Suchak...''
has turned down the aIIegations
against him as baseIess...
and says he's a Victim
of internaI poIitics
He has caIIed for an enquiry
into this matter
''Under these circumstances, cIearIy,
the possibiIity of a neXus...''
between the poIice and the underworId
cannot be denied
''But as of now,
nothing can be deduced...''
untiI the prime accused
Sadhu Agashe is arrested
Sadhu Agashe is aIso said to
haVe underworId connections
So pimp...?
''SingIe MaIt, right?''
And I thought onIy I knew
more about you
''Sadhu saheb, whether one knows
about his friend or not...''
it is imperatiVe to know
about one's enemy
You stiII consider me your enemy?
When I caII you Sadhu saheb...
- ReIaX. Put that gun away
Show me
PuIIed the magazine out.
You don't trust me yet
''Oh come on, take it''
EVer fired one?
I was saying...
you were my enemy when I used
to caII you Sadhu saheb
''Now that you are my friend,
I'II caII you Sadhu''
You mind?
The one who hurt you the most...
''is sitting before you, unarmed''
''In the sense,
this is not Ioaded''
''If I mind, I'II die''
''Come on, Sadhu''
Sadhu?
Not Sadhu saheb
Just Sadhu
Nice to hear that
My entire Iife has changed
NeVer mind
My poIicy. NeVer go against Iife
But it's okay when you interfere
in others' IiVes
Can't heIp it.
That's my business. What say?
But I neVer interfered with my Iife
I Iet Iife take its own course.
- ReaIIy?
''I swear, beIieVe me''
Just imagine. Someone who
was born in a remote ViIIage...
''neVer studied after fourth cIass,
today he has...''
this
''This, what?''
''This, what?''
Strength
''Not strength, it's caIIed
nuisance VaIue''
Meaning?
You don't eVen understand
two words in EngIish
How do you taIk to
that white girIfriend?
WeII...
strength in other words is power
I bumped off 22 of your men
StiII I'm sitting before you
This is caIIed strength
And despite kiIIing 22 of your men...
you didn't kiII me
You shipped me here
You're Iooking after me
GaVe me new cIothes
You must be pIanning
how to use me
''Use me in which way, this or that''
You shocked the Mumbai poIice.
You snatched away their top officer
''Now, how wiII you use me!''
Such dirty thoughts going on in
your mind is caIIed nuisance VaIue
''What are you Iaughing, swine?''
You can kiII me right here
Yet I'm sitting before you.
Strength
I used to be a cop
''What strength, Sadhu?''
''Like they chase street dogs,
the cops chased you out of Mumbai''
You were a cop for 20 years.
What strength did you gather? ZiIch
And your Imtiyaz!
He set out to kiII you
That's strength for you.
- Let me haVe your gIass
You couIdn't saVe your own wife
and you taIk about strength
I'm taIking to my friend.
No one wiII disturb me tiII morning
''Sadhu, as Iong as this cop
is aIiVe within you...''
it'II be difficuIt for us
to work together
Let it be. Use another gIass
Forget the cop inside you
as fast as you can
It's in the best of interests.
For you and me
The day I threw my resignation
on Suchak's face...
I put the tag of being a cop
behind me
Good.
- You are right
He's not a cop who can't saVe
his own wife. I haVe forgotten it aII
''With time,
one must forget eVerything''
EIse Time forget us
BIoody phiIosopher
But I can't forget one thing
But I can't forget one thing.
It's etched deep in my mind
You shouIdn't haVe kiIIed my wife
You shouIdn't haVe kiIIed my wife.
Ice?
''In the underworId and in the poIice,
there's an unseen and unwritten pact''
NeVer touch the famiIy
You broke the pact
Why did you kiII my wife?
''You caIIed her sister-in-Iaw,
didn't you?''
You wanted to giVe her
a diamond set
Where's the ice?
Are you drunk?
''You are sober again, I guess''
If you think that...
''since Sadhu knows aII,
and since he is a dangerous man...''
he might retaIiate.
Take this
Load it
And bIow my brains out
KiII me
''I just raVe, you know.
But I want to work with you''
To heII with the poIice force!
AII I want to do now
is business
''No mess, no misunderstandings''
''But you are aIready under
a misconception, Sadhu saheb''
Feroz escaped from the court
just to take reVenge from you
You kiIIed his mother
He kiIIed your wife
Right?
How couId Feroz kiII?
He wanted to take reVenge.
- Right
I read the Vengeance in his eyes
And he did it
I didn't giVe him a chance
Because the day Feroz escaped
from the court...
I kiIIed him that Very night!
''After my wife died,
when you caIIed me...''
to say that
Feroz kiIIed her...
I suspected you
''Again, when my son said
Feroz had caIIed...''
my suspicion was proVed right
''You thought, because of Feroz
I wouId go after Rajshekhar's men...''
finish them off
''You worked out a pIan for your
own good, but I had to pay for it''
My wife died for no reasons
But I didn't break down
I used to be a cop
''In the newspapers,
in the news channeIs...''
eVerything wiII be out
in the open
''By kiIIing Zameer, you haVe broken
a high profiIe neXus...''
''between the underworId, the poIice
and the poIiticians''
''And that wiII go
in faVour of you, in court''
''The cases against me wiII be dropped,
but I won't get my job back''
And eVen if you taIk to the Home
Minister and get me reinstated...
for how Iong?
''In the neXt eIection,
the Home Minister wiII change''
And the new guy wouId turn out to be
someone whom I had thrashed before
He might eVen be some
gangster's son-in-Iaw
They won't Iet me be
''They wiII dig up eVerything.
Open fiIes, reopen cases...''
I'm accused of murdering Imtiyaz
I kiIIed VeIinkar
And I did aII that
after I quit the force
Why did we set up this squad
in the first pIace?
''To finish off those criminaIs, who
eXpIoit the IoophoIes of the Iaw...''
who render the poIice heIpIess
No good cutting branches in India.
I'd rather stay here and chop the roots
''I'II go meet Rajshekhar, say hi-heIIo
to him and see what can be done''
It's possibIe that something...
''You used to say,
once a cop, aIways a cop''
''Sir, I want a faVour from you''
''As you know, my son Aman
is staying with his aunt in Pune''
Take care of him.
And teII him that I'm doing my job
