Narrator: "marketing 101."
( music playing )
If you live in any major city,
You see 800 ads a day.
In most of them, models are
going to be looking at you.
- Like they want to fuck you.
- ( Honks )
You're so used to this that you
don't even notice it any more,
But your body does.
Your heart rate increases,
Your pupils dilate,
you breathe faster...
- ( fireworks popping )
- You become more alert.
- ( woman singing )
- You've been tapped.
Looking at a billboard
is supposed to feel.
Like love at first sight.
But it's not real.
It's just marketing.
And without that,
You wouldn't even know
who you are.
( phone ringing )
You see, the first thing
you learn in business school.
Is that you need
to market yourself.
Before the ads do it for you.
Which is why they teach you
to pick a new name...
Brand yourself
and become the product.
- That you're trying to sell.
- Your name's scat?
Yeah, my name's scat.
Narrator: A name he chose because
it was closely associated.
- With jazz, beat poetry and..
- Animal shit.
N... like jazz.
It's a type of music.
You've had 16 sexual partners?
- Okay...
- Yeah.
Provided your blood test
comes back negative,
That'll be $54.
Fifty... don't you think my sperm's
worth a little more than that?
Because you've had
16 sexual partners,
There's already a 90% risk...
But I put on my form that
I don't have an s.T.I.
You could have written anything.
Ma'am, what am I supposed
to do with $54?
I can't pay my rent with $54.
Do you know how hard
it is for me.
To just give away my
future spawn for 54 bucks?
- How do you think they'd feel?
- Shh.
Cool name.
Narrator: This is scat's
roommate sneaky pete.
He broke his jaw sophomore year
after a motorcycle accident,
And had it wired shut. He
couldn't speak for three months.
The accident just so happened to
coincide with "marketing 304:".
Persona creation," where sneaky pete
received the only perfect score.
He hasn't said a word since.
You're a perfect
candidate, mr. Pete.
This is wonderful.
Provided your blood test...
Narrator: Pete visited the health
clinic 18 times his freshman year,
And it wasn't because
he had the flu.
That will be $270.
Narrator:
But the truth doesn't matter,
Because perception is reality.
Woman:
...Saving it for marriage.
Narrator: It's all just...
Marketing.

- Woman on phone: $54 a week?
Your sister makes more
at her lemonade stand.
Mom, it's just temporary.
Competition's stiff in this climate.
- ( Sighs ) you're settling.
- I'll get...
You used to be so innovative.
Remember when you won
the science fair, michael?
Mom, my name is scat now.
- Man: This form is now...
- ( Tv channels changing )
( bagpipes play )
Newscaster:
Recapping the stories...
Announcer:
Introducing the tiddy bear.
- That's t-I-d-d-y bear.
- ( Coughing )
The cute little guy
that eliminates all those.
Irritating shoulder
strap problems.
Designed to make
driving more comfortable...
- ( coughing continues )
- ...The tiddy bear snaps onto your shoulder strap.
And moves up and down to eliminate
uncomfortable pressure...
- Going to bed?
- Now you can have you own tiddy bear,
And eliminate
those annoying shoulder...
Narrator:
They say every person has three.
Million-dollar ideas
in their life.
Scat had three of them
before he turned seven...
- See you tomorrow.
- ...And many after.
In high school, he won
the state science fair.
For inventing
a new flavor of ice cream.
165 people showed up
for the taste test.
They just wanted vanilla.
You see, people don't care
about something new.
They just want
the same old thing.
Behind a new, sexier label...
- ( soda opens )
- Fuck!
Because taste doesn't matter.
It's all about the branding.
And without that...
It's just syrup and water.
( techno music playing,
woman vocalizing )
Pete, you awake?
I have an idea...
It's a drink idea.
It just clicked!
I'm gonna run with this, pete.
I really think this
could be it for me.
I might even be able to pull you in too.
You've got great ideas.
What do you think?
Do I, I mean do I go indie?
Do I try to sell
to one of the majors?
Yeah, it definitely
feels mainstream.
One of the majors.
Just need to get it
in front of the right guy.
- ( Pen clicking )
- Narrator: Little did he know.
Her name is six.
- Wow.
- ( Pop music playing )
♪ go party down now...
Narrator: Six sounds like sex.
That's the point.
Studies show that
the more men associate.
Sex with decision-making,
the more likely their answer.
Will be "yes" to anything
that you might request.
- Morning, six!
- Narrator: "what was the question?" you might ask.
- Man: Grade a.
- Man ♪2: Great ass.
Do you really think it matters?
- ( phone rings )
- Addy. This is beth.
Sure!
Welcome to the addison
company, how may I help you?
Hello, beth is it?
I'm the brother to your new
products marketing manager.
And I... ( clears throat )
It's the whole family. We have this
special birthday surprise planned...
Who do you wish to see, sir?
- Six.
- I'm sorry,
New products doesn't accept
unscheduled meetings.
Yeah, I know that, beth. That's why I'm here.
I was hoping you'd.
Put me through to her so that
I can sort this all out.
- ( Phone rings )
- Addy. This is beth!
Sure, you're welcome!
I'm sorry, new products doesn't
accept unsolicited calls.
Tell me, beth, how do you suggest
that I contact my own sister?
I refuse to solicit a call.
- That's just absurd.
- Try her cell.
- Have a nice day, sir.
- ( Phone rings )
Addy. This is beth.
Yeah, the ingredients
in addison beverages.
Are suitable for vegetarians.
( alarm bell ringing )
Woman: Should we reschedule?
Man: No, I don't know.
( people chatting )
- Ugh.
- Not sure how long we'll have to stay out here.
( Exhales )
- ( clears throat )
- Woman: All over my phone.
Man: I suppose we
should stand over here.
- You know how they first marketed fire alarms?
- Hired arsonists.
- Yeah.
- "Marketing 101."
I hear 'em from my manicurist,
my pilates instructor,
My girlfriend.
I don't need yours.
You don't need my what?
A drink idea.
Okay, I have to say it: Bravo.
You've got the sex thing,
you've got the wealth thing,
You've totally got
the mystery thing.
You think this is an image?
You're right.
Don't ruin the magic.
The insurance company
only obligates.
A four-minute mandatory
evacuation for all fire alarms,
Which means you have 25 seconds.
- Before addy starts losing money.
- What?
Can't we set up
a meeting, something?
I have an idea that could make
your company millions of dollars.
And you're giving me 30 seconds?
That's how long we have
to sell our customers.
It's called advertising.
Five seconds.
All right.
Okay okay! Jet black
can called "fukk"!
8:00 p.M., alain ducasse.
11:00 a.M., coffee.
I don't do dinner.
12:00, lunch!
Abe & arthur's.
Or I'm going to zephco.
Tampering with a fire alarm
is a federal offense.
Men categorize women
in one of four ways:
Mothers, virgins,
sluts and bitches.
Of course, none of the above.
Is suitable for
the modern businesswoman.
But you can create
your own image.
By selecting pieces
of each archetype.
That work for you.
For example,
the sexual attractiveness...
Of the slut.
The wisdom of the mother.
The integrity of the virgin.
The independence of the bitch.
This leaves men confused
and unable to pigeon-hole you.
What they're forced
to do instead is.
Take you seriously.
- Mr. Scat.
- Ms. Six.
As this is a business lunch,
a handshake is appropriate.
I completely agree.
I always say lunch
lubricates business.
- Lubricates what?
- Nothing. I don't lubricate.
- Mr. Scat...
- Scat.
- This idea of yours, "fuck"...
- Yeah, that's f-u-k-k.
That addresses my first concern.
Now, with regard
to the target market,
I'm assuming you're after the young,
cynical image-conscious consumer?
- ( Phone chimes )
- Like yourself.
Mr. Scat, don't confuse
me with a consumer.
I don't buy anything.
Exactly, it'd be
like drinking irony.
No, we're not ready yet.
Did you have any
thoughts on taste?
Well, no.
People don't buy energy drinks
based on taste, do they?
No, I just was wondering.
Well, then...
Something eye-wateringly sharp,
With a kind of
chemical aftertaste,
So you think, "this must be
powerful!" ( bangs table )
Good.
Good.
- Where are you going?
- I'm leaving.
What about lunch?
Mm-hmm.
May I say you're very young to
be managing your own department?
I'm 21.
No, seriously...
21.
- I'll give you 25... okay, 24.
- ( Sighs )
Mr. Scat, I am 21.
Now deal with it.
Okay, marketer to marketer,
You're not 21,
- And...
- What?
You're not gay.
I graduated from
high school when I was 15,
Courtesy of an
advanced-learning program.
I did four years at u.C.L.A.,
an m.B.A. At stanford,
And now after three months
at addison, I am 21 years old.
I lie about going
to stanford too.
Perhaps you should
see someone about that.
Look, fukk's mediocre,
it's not great.
I was thinking, what if the can has
a ton of compressed air in it,
So when you pop one,
everyone around hears it.
No, we had a bad experience
with aeration in massachusetts.
300 people called to complain
about excessive gassiness.
And besides, there was
that exploding-can fatality.
Have I had you sign
a non-disclosure form?
- No.
- I'm going to need you to do that.
Actually I don't need you to come
in until we present to the board,
And they don't convene
until next week.
- I'll courier you the form.
- Mediocre, huh?
Look, I work for a company
that could buy.
A continent if they wanted to.
I have people that fix ideas.
Addiland? Hmm.
The point is just sit tight.
I'm going to have my team work
through the night to make it great.
I'm assembling them now.
Okay.
- Okay.
- Could you not use that word?
"Okay"?
"Addy" is the second most
well-known word in the world.
- We're shooting for number one. You get me?
- I get you.
- Why six?
- What?
Why did you pick six,
why not, you know, five?
I didn't pick it.
It is my real name.
Nobody's parents give them
an unusually cool name.
There are only
parent-given regular names.
And parent-given
embarrassing names.
I went to school with a kid
named petal, for christ's sake.
I hate to wreck your theory, but
I was named six by my parents.
Although not at first.
When I was born,
I was christened "zero,".
When I turned one,
I was renamed to "one."
It was actually quite touching,
having my name as well as my age.
On my birthday cake
in frosty blue icing.
Even if I believed you can
remember your first birthday,
Which I don't,
what happened to seven?
When I was six, my parents
died in a plane crash.
Taxi!
- We'll be in touch.
- ( Car honks )
( sighs )
Scat: I'm in love.
She's like a rose
dipped in poison.
She sells herself better
than anyone I've ever met.
I think there was
some sexual tension.
I've always wanted
sexual tension.
She's having a team
work through the night.
To present to the board
tomorrow and she said.
They don't meet till next week.
She lies right to my face,
Outrageous lies, and you know what?
I believe them.
She's trying to steal my idea.
She's fantastic!
Yes.
I wonder what her real name is.
Woman: Please leave a
message at the tone.
Scat: Hey, mom, you'll
never believe this.
I pitched an idea to addison
cola company yesterday.
And, well, nothing's
for sure yet,
- But they're having me present to the board today.
- Hey hey.
- Hey!
- Guard: Hey hey!
Hey you! Damn it!
Oh, hey!
You'd get a real
kick out of this.
It's a whole room
filled with rich executives.
All listening to me
pitch my drink idea.
Wish me luck, I wore a suit.
- ( elevator dings )
- It's pete's.
And later,
we will further develop...
Guard: Come back here!
What's going on?
Hey!
We are prepared to go
to all measures...
However as we...
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was toxic.
Chairman, gentlemen, may I
present to you mr. Scat?
The creator of fukk.
How's everybody doing?
Is mr. Scat here
one of our employees?
- Actually, he is...
- Scat: No, not yet.
Sir, he is simply
a contractor I've brought in.
- To help with some logistics.
- I hate to burst your bubble,
But we don't develop
products that we don't own.
Gentlemen, my partner
may have misled you.
See, mr. Scat and I have
co-developed fukk.
And he is prepared to relinquish
trademark rights for only $2 million.
- That's good.
- ( Muttering )
Does that mean...?
Yes, scat,
you're rich and famous.
You did register that
trademark, didn't you?
Chairman: Thanks, hon.
That's enough.
- ( buzzer sounds)
- Woman: Number 32!
- Hi!
- Hi! Hello!
If I have a name for a new drink
and it hasn't been registered,
I can do that
through you, right?
Oh yes, dear. What's the
name of your drink?
It's f-u-k-k.
( Chuckles ) oh, "fook"?
Okay. I'll just enter that
into the machine here.
"Fook, fook, fook, fook, fook,
Fook, fook, fook, fook, fook."
( hisses ) ooh, I'm sorry.
That name has already
been registered.
- Just this morning too.
- What?
One person but with two names.
Fucking bitch.
- What's her real name?
- Huh?
One of her names is six.
What's her other name?
Oh, uh, one of the names
is peter ang...
And the other is sneaky pete.
Huh! That's kind of fun...
( door slams )
( keys drop )
Shit!
- Scat: Pick up, pick up!
- ( Horns honking )
Sneaky pete. Now it actually
fucking makes sense.
You asshole. You fucking asshole!
I trusted you.
Do you think they want
a stolen idea, pete?
Nobody likes a lawsuit.
Six isn't stupid.
She knows how to navigate
these things.
I've already heard from her people,
her legal department, they...
Fuck.
Narrator: Well, congratulations.
You've just completed
"marketing 101."
Man: Hello. Hello?
Scat: Good evening, mr. Becker.
- Who's this?
- I have some good news for you, mr. Becker.

Mother: Honey, I just saw
your drink this afternoon.
In the soda machine
at the tennis club.
And jenna...
You know jenna,
sophie's mother...
Anyway, I overheard her
telling her friends.
How she just loves a good fukk.
I realized she was talking
about you! Your drink!
I'm just so proud of you.
Send pete my love, honey,
And include him in
everything you're doing, huh?
We'll speak soon. Bye-bye.

You look, um...
How are you?
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm great. Thank you.
Good. Good!
Very good.
- Fukk.
- Hmm?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, they're great. They're...
They're fantastic. I-I...
I really like what you did
with the carbonation.
We put a disclaimer
on the bottom of the can.
Yeah, I saw that.
I... Wondered.
About how you might be doing.
( Chuckles ) I'm fantastic.
I mean...
You mean the trademark thing?
That's business, you know.
But I've got so much
going on, that...
It didn't...
How's it doing?
Number one energy drink
in the nation.
Wow, that's fantastic.
I mean congratulations.
That's huge.
Yeah.
It wasn't really me.
Hey, six, let's go!
Pete's waiting. He's got
a big surprise for you.
Of course.
( Piano music playing )
- ( hip-hop music playing )
- ( Woman singing )
Man: Mr. Pete would
like to firstly.
Thank everyone in this room.
For all of their hard work
and determination.
During the summer fukk campaign.
Gentlemen, we are once again
projected at number one.
- ( cheers, applause )
- Man ♪2: And well deserved.
Now, now...
Mr. Pete would like
to personally extend.
His warmest congratulations
to ms. Six.
After all, this was her baby.
But you can rest
assured, ms. Six,
With pete fathering
the fukk campaign.
- From here on out, your baby is in good hands.
- ( Man laughs )
Hopefully, the classic campaign
won't be too much work for you.
( laughter )
( slaps )
Scat: What was that?
My baby shower.
- You're not...
- No shit!
I've been taken off fukk and
stuck babysitting addy classics.
- Why?
- Senior management loves sneaky pete.
Everyone else is
terrified of him!
So I'm stuck implementing
a 15-year-old campaign.
Fucking men!
I'm replacing the campaign
with something better.
- Much better.
- What's that?
Ideas aren't my strength, scat.
My strengths are development, management and
negotiation, which clearly you don't have.
Or else you'd be worth $2 million
right now, wouldn't you?
You got another fukk in you?
- Have I...?
- Right.
I shouldn't have asked.
I'm sure you're busy.
- So we'd be working together.
- Yes.
- Having lunch together.
- Possibly.
- Living together.
- Yeah... no!
- Why would we be living together?
- I need a place to stay.
- I don't have any furniture at my place.
- I'll loan you a mattress.
- The lease is almost up.
- This is only for five days.
Why? - If any new production is
gonna make it in time for summer,
- They need it by the end of the week.
- So you're asking me.
To come up with an entire
advertising campaign.
For addy classics in five days?
No, that would be
a waste of time.
I need you to come up with an entire
advertising campaign for fukk.
I want to beat pete.
C'mon, what's the worst
that could happen?
You don't think of anything
and go back to your...
Other work.
My other...?
I'm definitely staying
at your place then.
I live in times square
with my girlfriend.
Tina doesn't like men...
At all.
Why are you smiling?
'Cause this is
what it feels like.
To be the guy you need.
You can have the sofa.
Not a bed.
- Pillows are subject to availability.
- Sure.
And you do not wander
into rooms, you knock.
Of course.
And most importantly...
You leave that toilet seat down.
I may not be able
to control that.
- Then I hope you can hold it.
- It's instinctual.
I think a handshake
is appropriate.
This is exciting.
I feel good about this.
Five days though?
Isn't that cutting it close?
Whatever. We can
probably stretch it.
Loose deadline, right?
I'll assign a team once you
get the hang of things,
Relieve some of your... Stress.
Kind of like you did on fukk?
( Street noise )
( keys drop )
This is it.
( Distant siren )
Are you gonna say it?
- You're clearly not a lesbian.
- ( Sighs )
What?
We leave for work at 7:00.
I'll wake you at 6:00.
- Okay.
- Scat, that word.
Even outside of work?
- ( Slams )
- There is no outside of work.
- ( plates break )
- Six: Shit.
Shit!
( horns honking )
I made you breakfast.
Wow.
I never would have picked you.
For a woman who would
cook for a man.
Why not?
Because of the sexism.
- Are you trying to be sensitive?
- I am sensitive.
So, what, according to you, women
aren't allowed to cook for men?
Reversing the gender stereotype
doesn't eliminate it.
If you weren't sexist, you wouldn't
care I made you breakfast.
- All right.
- No no no, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I appreciate it, six.
You like them fluffy?
I made them fluffy.
I love fluffy.
Eat quick, we leave in 20.
Quicker.
Narrator: In "marketing 482:
Product relatability,".
You learn to analyze love,
Longing and desire,
As if it were a tool
to sell a product.
As far as we know,
it's a stimulation.
Of the brain's ventral tegmental
area and caudate nucleus.
These areas are also involved
in major purchasing decisions,
So a lot of research is going in
to how to trigger them directly,
With a fragrance, for example,
Or a particular sequence
of notes.
The ultimate goal,
of course, is a method.
Of making any given person
fall hopelessly in love.
With any given product.
We haven't figured
that out yet, but...
We're getting there.
We're getting there.
Signing in a sub-contractor.
Today.
Yeah.
( Elevator dinging )
( dings )
Six.
Woman: Who the fuck told the
band we'd cover their mini-bar?
No, it's not fucking all right.
It's not fucking all right at all!
Man: We want 50k
on that, minimum.
You can't get a good-looking
priest for under 50k.
I spent hours going
through the casting.
Welcome back.
This is my office?
- ( Phone ringing )
- No, that is your office.
Call me if you need anything.
Oh, and by the way,
If anyone asks,
you're consulting.
On an addy classics campaign.
( Chuckles )
So you're the new chet.
Excuse me?
A word of advice...
Nothing.
( Phone ringing )
( phone ringing )
( phone beeping )
Scat, don't do that.
You feel important,
but you look pompous.
That is quite a control complex
you've got there.
I know that you enjoy
psychoanalyzing me,
But not everything I do reveals
my innermost secret feelings.
Sometimes, I'm just
trying to prevent you.
From embarrassing us.
You need a little leadership.
Oh, that's leadership?
What about your inability.
To accept anyone else's
point of view?
Focus. Let's focus.
- Your paranoia?
- Business savvy.
Obsessive need to know
everything that's going on?
- Organizational skills.
- Aggressiveness?
( Chuckles )
Okay, that means
we're moving up the 3:00.
To 2:00, but that's fine,
we can move the 2:00.
That's the old 2:00 to 4:00...
Mr. Pete?
Mr. Pete.
This is scat,
A contractor I've
brought in to help.
- With some campaign logistics.
- ( Scoffs )
Man's voice: "marketing 545:
Creating and sustaining
a competitive advantage.
"In the workplace."
With rivalry always comes
motivation to succeed.
So what do we have?
Okay.
( Clears throat )
I know that some...
Creative people
can find pressure.
Counter-productive, but...
Tomorrow's Friday.
What happens if I can't
think of anything?
I mean...
You can't really rush
this sort of thing, you know?
I have faith in you.
All right.
Okay, well...
This needs more work,
but tell me what you think.
- ( Taps table )
- So we open on a beach.
Frolicking teenagers,
sun, bikinis,
Then a shadow falls over them.
They turn and there's
this gigantic beach ball.
I mean, it's 100' tall, right?
And as it rolls towards them,
They run and they
scream and they...
- What?
- How does that sell the product?
- It's just cool.
- We don't need "just cool," scat!
We need brilliant!
They're going to fire me, scat.
I cancelled the old
campaign already.
It's too late to go back.
Pete put me in charge of mundane
re-processing procedures,
So I just...
Canceled it.
So unless you come up
with something brilliant.
By 6:00 tomorrow afternoon,
addy will have.
No summer campaign for fukk
and we'll both be fired.
Not in a cool way.
Not dramatically.
We'll just clean out
our desks and go home.
You'll catch a bus back to your
furniture-free apartment.

Scat just happened
to be sick that week.
Help help... oop.
- Six: You can do it.
- Scat: What?
Come up with the world's greatest
ad in less than 12 hours?
Really, you think so?
'cause I gotta say,
At this point, I think it's
more likely that I'm not.
It would be irresponsible
of me, as your manager,
To put that excess
pressure on you.
This isn't excess pressure?
This feels like excess pressure.
It's simple, scat:
Yield results, keep your job.
Why'd you have to go and make
me breakfast, and then just...
- You're an adult. Try and...
- You don't give a crap about me.
- You never have. I feel used.
- You're throwing a tantrum.
Well then, you shouldn't
have made me breakfast.
I feel like I'm going
to my own execution.
You knew it was impossible,
but you still had the nerve.
You know what?
This isn't even about drama.
This is about basic respect
and human decency,
And you don't...
You can do this.
Narrator: It only takes
an 18th of a second.
For a synapse in your brain
to trigger a thought.
Or a million-dollar idea.
( vacuum humming )
( clears throat )
What do you got?
Here's how to spot
the difference.
Between art and marketing.
Marketing starts with an unfulfilled
need in the marketplace.
And figures out how to plug it.
Art, on the other hand,
starts with the idea.
Figuring out how to sell it
comes later, if at all.
This way makes better stuff,
But a lot of the time
there's no market for it.
This way makes more money,
But a lot of the time
the idea sucks,
'cause you can't force ideas
to turn up when you need them.
They just do...
Or they don't.
I've got nothing.
- ( Vacuuming continues )
- ( Exhales )
What?
Well, at least you had fun.
- You just flushed me down the toilet.
- Beach balls?
I don't know, maybe we
should have gone with that.
No, we shouldn't.
It was a stupid idea,
Just like all your
other stupid ideas.
Your company paid $2 million
for one of those stupid ideas.
- Because I sold it to them!
- You know what?
This is not cool.
This is not cool. Fuck!
- Fuck!
- Scat, cut it out.
I feel like I'm babysitting.
It is not acceptable to throw
tantrums in public places.
( bangs )
( screams )
- Don't do that.
- I am not going back to that life.
Where everything was annoying
and boring and sucked!
- I'm not!

Man: Congratulations!
( bell rings )
Woman: Can I have everyone's
attention, please?
Thank you. Mr. Pete would
like to congratulate.
Ms. Six and mr. Scat
on the new campaign.
This is exactly
the type of initiative.
That mr. Pete likes
to foster in new products,
So, well done.
( Applause )
By the way, I am mr. Pete's
new personal assistant.
My name...
Is three.
That's my image!
They've stolen my image!
Come on, you're twice
the woman she is.
- That's my image.
- 'Cause three plus three...
Are you talking?
Do you know how long
it took me to develop that?
Three. That's not even right!
Three! What is that
even supposed to mean?
What's six supposed...
oh, of course.
( Clears throat )
Six, scat.
Mr. Pete wanted you
to know that even though.
What happened yesterday
was an unforgivable.
And despicable form of sabotage,
There are no hard feelings.
Mr. Pete's only concern is
the outcome of this company.
And we're going
to work really hard.
To make sure that
this new campaign of yours.
Doesn't turn
into a total disaster.
That consumes both of your careers.
Understand?
Interesting look.
Make sure that security
doesn't see you up here.
Fukk!
How was that?
Six, check it out.
We got the dailies
back from the studio.
- Three: Not bad, scat.
- Subtle, I like that.
- Not bad at all.
- I thought you were six.
- I'm not spock.
- Seriously...
Isn't this a little demeaning?
Oops, said his name.
He was a fucking sick...
Let me ask you something...
And I know that this
is super personal,
But I was just
kind of wondering...
Why do you like six so much?
Is it because you like
to be pushed around?
No, of course not. Whoa...
Maybe that's part of it.
You know it's not real, right?
You know there's not one
thing genuine about her.
You know that she's not
even a real lesbian, right?
Yeah, of course I know that.
You could have saved me
some embarrassment.
Scat, there is nothing
real about her.
She's just image!
Why do you shackle
yourself to her?
Sneaky pete will
take care of you...
- And so will I.
- No no no, you don't know six...
At all.
( Breathes deeply )
It's cold tonight.
So you should sleep with me.

With the exception
of an optional prop.

to get naked too fast,
Thinking that's what
the audience is there for.
It's not.
Sex is biology.
Sex appeal.
Is marketing.
It's not the naked body
that's exciting.
It's the possibility.
( Music stops )
That's your side.
All right? You stay on that side.
And this is my side.
There is...
No need for overlap.
Okay.
And don't fidget.
You have a tendency
to fidget sometimes.
Don't do that.
- Okay.
- Scat, that word.
( Street noise )
( sirens blaring )
- ( slaps )
- Ow! What was that?
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- I'm kissing you!
- I'm not your little woman!
- You invited me to bed!
You can't ever
take me for granted!
- What am I doing here?
- I don't know!
- I... I don't know.
- Do you care about me?
Be honest with me, do you?
Do you care about me?
Look, I am begging you, six, I am
begging you just to be honest with me,
And to give me one clear sign.
Look, I like you.
I need to know if you
feel anything for me.
Or if I'm just some naive moron.
That you're using
to get what you want.
( Sighs )
You're more than
a naive moron to me.

Because like so many

Parker decided to try something.
That he saw on tv.

- On television, a falling addy machine.
Doesn't seem like it would hurt.
In fact, it seems
almost funny, but...
Parker tragically discovered.
That life is not always
like it is.
On tv.
Would anyone care
to share a few words?
- ( lawnmower )
- ( Birds chirping )
I would.
Yes, please, come up.
Scat. Scat!
I used to think that
it didn't matter.
I was so lost
with what we could do...
That I never considered
whether we should.
It's a great power
that we wield.
It's a great and terrible power.
Maybe we've forgotten
that one basic truth:
Power requires responsibility.
I don't know.
Maybe us marketers
have lost our way.
- You know...
- Scat, come on.
- Let's go, come on.
- What the hell are you doing?
- What?
- Don't these people.
Look awfully attractive to you?
I saw the blonde use

Come on.

And we know we need a scapegoat.
But let's be very clear as to
who that scapegoat should be.
This whole debacle was deliberately
arranged by sneaky pete.
Let's not go accusing

We have absolutely no proof...

Gentlemen, I am confident
that an event this expensive.
Can be traced

I don't know enough

mr. Pete's motives,
But if it's true,
then I would feel.
Fairly confident
that it was part...
- No.
- No what?
- The situation here is very clear...
- Excuse me!
- We need to call a press conference...
- Part of a strategic plan.
Done! - And announce that this
episode was an underhanded attempt.
By sneaky pete
to discredit a colleague,
And that addison will not
tolerate such behaviour.
And that he has been fired.
I mean, how else
would we explain it?
Say that scat went
temporarily insane?
- Well...
- Okay, the real question here.
Is who would you rather have
running your marketing department?
Someone with integrity,
Or someone who will do
anything to get to the top,
- No matter what the cost.
- Hmmm.
Which scat will also do,
- But with integrity.
- Man: Scat is very new here.
I am not.
- You had to open the coffin.
- I hope you and pete.
Live happily ever after.

To reveal
our employer, mr. Scat,
But we can say they turned
over $18.4 billion last year.
Zephco?
That's too specific.
Guys...
Mr. Scat, we just want
to talk, just talk.
Yes, I did.
Yes I did.
I can't say no. I can't say no.
( Phones ringing )
( pencil tapping )
No.
( Pencil tapping )
( exhales, humphs )

( clatters )
Research.
( laughs )
Let's talk straight.
Zephco doesn't know
what you were doing.
With that funeral stunt, but
whatever it was, it was brilliant.
Because everyone's
talking about it.
Here's the thing, we have
great marketing already,
All these competitions
and giveaways.
- We have excellent execution.
- No, you don't.
Yes...?
Look, we need to beat addy.
And we were doing just fine
until guess who comes along.
- Sneaky pete!
- The inventor of fukk!
- Fuk. Fuk.
- It's "fuck."
- You know about fukk?
- Yeah, I know about fukk.
The drink is genius.
Naturally we immediately
tried to poach mr. Pete, but...
Since he turned us down,
here we are.
We feel you have the potential.
To be the next sneaky pete.
Now we know you worked with him.
On the "die for a fuk"
campaign, right?
You were... fuck. You...
You were clearly... "fuk."
You were clearly
a team at the funeral.
Right? And now this whole
guerilla marketing,
You know, with the
rickshaws... genius, genius!
Genius. It speaks volumes to us.
That mr. Pete trusts you
as much as he does.
Volumes.
And we have been
empowered by the c.E.O.
To hire you right now.
- Okay, look...
- We get it.
You're happy at addison.
- I'm not happy at addison, I'm not even at addison.
- Shut up, scat!
We're hoping that our
ridiculous salary package.
- Might change your mind.
- ( Clears throat )
- Exactly how ridiculous?
- ( Laughter )
I think it's safe to say.
Very ridiculous. ( Laughter )
Preposterous, even.
( elevator dinging )
- It's a great opportunity.
- Yep.
- It's a lot of money.
- Yep.
- What was your real name?
- Six.

You have 62

Not including the call centre.

What is this?
We need to get this...
- ( kids chattering )
- No, no, no.
This is not for me.
I thought we covered that.
Excuse me. Your remaining
budget is $200 million.
Your office.
What do you think?
It'll do.
I appreciate your
coming on so quickly.
- We need you.
- Of course. We're happy to be here.
You don't understand.
You've got to help me.
I have stock options.
We are very committed
to making this work.
In fact, let me ask you something.
How do you feel.
About attack marketing? I know
there's some potential for backlash,
But in a basic duopoly like this.
Diluting their u.S.P. Could be
nothing but beneficial for us.
I don't know what
the hell you just said.
- Just sell product.
- Absolutely.
Can do, sir.
Good.
You're exactly the same.
I'm sorry, did I allude
to being someone I'm not?
- Are you trying to be ironic?
- No.
Anyone who works with you
loses their soul.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- That I lost my soul? You should be.
No, that you don't
want to work, scat.
- Stop being so dramatic.
- Oh god!
You couldn't figure
out how to fuck me.
So get over it.
- We have work to do.
- I never just wanted to fuck you.
Everyone wants to just fuck me.
I'm different!
You're still a guy, right?
Thinks with his dick.
If that were the case, I could
have settled for a whole lot less.
And don't tell me
that I just want you.
Because I can't have you,
because that's...
That's...
Call the s.M.T.
Now.
Narrator: The s.M.T. Stands
for senior management team,
An acronym that scat picked up
in "business 185:".
Understanding
the corporate structure."
"average kok."
Man: Just have to
take a look at it.
Yeah, now isn't that
basically fukk?
Who wants to drink a fukk
when you can down a kok?
Kok is like fukk for sissies.
It's "fuk." "fuk."
The important word
here isn't "kok."
"average"?
( Snaps ) here's how it works.
The less religious you are,
the more likely it is.
You're interested
in celebrities.
Know that old question, "if you could
have dinner with any five people",
Living or dead,
who would you choose?"
Nobody ever picks their friends.
We're not going to sell
this product to your friends.
Not yet, anyway. Now zeph is
way too mainstream for this,
- So we set up a small subsidiary...
- ( Crashes )
- What the...
- ...That looks independent. We call it "z2."
Z2 releases average kok with
absolutely no above-the-line,
But a ton of astroturfing,
word-of-mouth,
Seeding, black lemmings,
the works.
Once sales are solid,
we send a crate of product.
To the 100 hottest
people in the country.
But not average kok.
We tell them,
"for you, we've got the real
thing, the personalized can."
With their name
and their number on the back.
Now they're intrigued.
They see our invitation
to send one of their people.
To a closed meeting
at the z2 warehouse.
And there,
we explain how it works.
Ladies and gentlemen,
There are 100 numbered cans...
Each linked to
a specific celebrity.
For example, the hilton 88s.
Ms. Hilton is currently
in possession of the only 88s.
In the world,
outside of this company.
And we will not sell
any 88s to anyone.
Unless they bring in
an unopened 88.
That's a sign that ms. Hilton
considers them worthy enough.
To be seen with her product.
That person may then purchase
as many 88s as they'd like,
But no other number.
Here's the catch.
If someone brings us an 88,
And we don't feel
they're kok material,
Or if our people see
someone in public.
With an 88 we don't
feel is worthy of kok,
We will terminate the 88s.
No exceptions. No appeals.
This product is image in a can.
We take image very seriously.
We take it as seriously.
As you take the clients
that you represent.
That's it, people.
Those of you who
brought cans can begin.
Scat: As soon as word
gets out about this,
Sales of average kok
will free-fall, sure.
But demand for
celebrity kok will soar,
Driven by the implicit endorsement
of the world's top celebrities.
Now they won't be able to buy it,
but they'll be desperate for it.
And the real beauty
of all of this.
Is what they want to buy...
it isn't the drink.
It's the marketing,
I mean, the image,
- Something that didn't exist-
- Let me hold you up there a minute.
What does this product
taste like?
- I'm sorry, what did you say?
- Scat: Taste?
- Don't you think that's important?
- No, I don't.
This product could be sneakers or
t-shirts or glow-in-the-dark headbands.
It's not about the fluid, man.
It's about the image!
70% of what we perceive
as taste is psychological.
As long as this thing
tastes better than urine,
People are literally going
to convince themselves.
- That they like it.
- Actually, people can believe.
- They like the taste of urine.
- Really?
- We tested it once.
- Scat: Sports drink?
We tested it once.
We didn't sell it.
Look, I can't explain it
any clearer than this,
The success of this
product... stop it!
The success of this product
depends on people.
Being shallow,
superficial, self-obsessed,
Greedy and desperate
for attention.
This is the american dream
in a fucking can.

In fact, you're
refusing to sell it.
Correct, sir. That's why
people want to buy it.
- But my stock options.
- Sir,
Do you realize what would happen.
If we released kok
to the general public now?
Sure, sales would be massive,
but all those celebrities.
Who basically built our brand,
they'd be humiliated.
It'd be like us saying
to the world, "hey!"
We just fucked over

- I gotta call six.
- Somebody that has a low opinion...
Don't call six. Don't call six.
The kid's dead, scat.
We had our research
department fact check.
Okay? The mother's
already hired a lawyer.
We need you to go live with this.
Before the 8:00 news. Okay?
We've arranged a pre-taped
c.N.B.C. Interview.
You'll need to...
Spin this.
You want me to spin the suicide?
That's what we pay you for.
We just want to come up.
With an angle on this together.
We couldn't... Bup bup bup.
You want me to fire someone?
( Mutters )
Yeah.
Who am I going
to fire, davidson?
It was my idea,
it was my concept.
Yeah, it was a great concept.
That's not the issue.
Where's six?
Personally, I never
had a connection.
There was no synergy,
but I tried.
I think that'll be enough.
( line ringing )
Six, look, call me back, okay?
Um, don't go back to the office.
Just call me back.
And I'll come meet you wherever.
- ( Line ringing )
- ( Vibrating )
Six: Yes, you'd be working
directly under me.
And you would have quite
a bit of creative freedom.
Um, it's just I'm very excited
about this opportunity.
What do you think that you can
bring to the next campaign?
Hey, jen, hey, it's scat.
Where are you?
Jameson's looking for you.
Look, where's six, jen?
Where was her 2:00?
She's interviewing
a new creative.
It's in the village.
It's a lunch thing, I think.
Thank you.
Man: Thank you for lunch.
Are you fucking kidding me?
- This is scat.
- I have heard so much about you.
- You ignore my calls for this?
- It's not what you think, scat.
Of course it's not what I think,
Because it's you.
- You're never what I think.
- What do you care?
- What do I care?
- Yeah, what the hell do you care?
They're grooming you for v.P.
You've got some great ideas,
and I look forward.
To seeing how we can
incorporate them.
Into zephco's current
campaigns, which will probab...
She always starts
with those fucking ideas.
- Welcome to zephco.
- ( Chuckles )
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
( Horns honking )
( bell ringing )
Man: We're live in 30 seconds.
- Did you make the market?
- Man ♪2: Just... yep.
- Makeup's clear.
- Want me to roll the tape?
- Perfect.
- Here you go.
Man on tv: Some sad breaking
news coming to us tonight.
Damien white, a young teenager,
age 16, has committed suicide.
He left behind
a suicide note that reads,
"I love everybody.
I just wish
I could have been cooler."
On the back, a hand-drawn...
Let me just check
your microphone.
- Allegedly damien...
- Jen, it's six.
Believed himself
cool enough to buy kok,
- The ultra-elite celebrity energy drink sold...
- Is jameson there?
- ...Only to 100 celebrities up until yesterday...
- ( Exasperated sigh )
When it was released
to the general public.
( chattering )
Celebrities have
been tweeting...
Good evening, I'm lisa simmons.
We have some sad breaking news
coming to us tonight.
- Peter: We have sad breaking news.
- Lisa: Damien white,
- A young teenager at age 16 has committed suicide.
- Quiet please!
( people chattering )
Pete: Hello hello.
What are you doing here?
Look, I need a place to stay.
That three, man...
She took my job at addy.
You knew that, right?
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah.
They had to fire someone
for letting you and six go.
Hey, I'm sorry about...
It's all right.
It's just business.
( Baby crying )
Yeah.
I'm thinking
of changing my image.
Really?
I liked the whole
silent... Thing.
Yeah, but it's kind of limiting.
There's only so far
you can go with that.
You know...
You were a really good
arch-enemy.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Especially after
you got me fired.
- I was fuming.
- ( Chuckles )
- Thanks.
- ( Crying continues )
I'm in love with a girl.
I don't even know her real name.
You, my friend,
are in love with an image.
- Is that bad?
- Eh...
( laughter )
Six quit.
She quit...
Because of you.
Man: ...Cool enough to buy their product.
How do they recover, John?
How does zephco turn this around
and use it to their advantage?
Well, they don't.
Right now, zephco should be
entirely on the defensive.
A young child has committed
suicide because this company.
Refused to sell them a drink.
This is a prime example.
Of corporate bullying
as far as I'm concerned.
- Man: "corporate bullying"? That's a term...
- Is this real?
That's because companies usually
don't refuse to sell...
He actually killed himself?
Yeah.
Yeah, the family
already lawyered up.
What usually happens
in circumstances like this.
Is that zephco would
identify a fall guy,
Someone in the marketing department,
and terminate them publicly...
He's just an intern, scat.
They're grooming you for v.P.
I feel like I'm losing you.
Jameson won't take
any of my calls.
You're supposed to let me go.
That's why you came here, right?
You know, I was a ballerina.
I had dreams...
Like the kind we sell to people.
( Chuckles )
I was going to go to the
levinheimer academy...
Travel around europe.
It wasn't just a goal, scat.
It was an absolute.
And then I went to yale...
And I went to london,
Did my audition.
And they told me I was
missing a muscle in my calf.
I couldn't even do
the battement glisse.
A simple move.
I was missing a muscle in my leg.
And there was nothing
I could do about it.
Ever.
I decided then...
That no one was ever going
to be able to tell me.
What I could
and couldn't do again.
Ever.
And now I'm here,
Sitting in a bar,
Waiting for you to fire me.
- Ironic.
- Is that real?
What?
Do you know how hard it is for
me to tell you the truth?
So you wanted to be a ballerina?
I wanted to be...
Right.
Okay.
Try our new
rejuvenating formula.
You'll look younger,
feel younger...
- ( door opens, shuts )
- Man: We're here with the head.
Of new products
and marketing for zephco.
Mr. Scat, thank you
for joining us.
Scat: I only wish it was
under better circumstances.
I want to offer
my sincere condolences.
To the white family
on behalf of zephco.
Mr. Scat, it doesn't
seem like the death.
Of an innocent teenager
has affected you.
If you're asking me
to acknowledge the fact that.
Through this ad campaign
people will literally.
Kill themselves to get their
hands on what I'm selling...
Then yes.
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
This is one of the most successful
ad campaigns of all time.
It will certainly go down in
history as one of the most daring.
I know who damien white is...
or who he was.
Because I fell in love
with the dream too.
But I don't want to spend
the rest of my life.
Chasing after an enigma.
And neither did damien.
Look, I don't think that anybody.
Is taking the death of this
teenager very seriously.
Because they're still
buying my product.
This means that you've made
a conscious decision.
To buy this drink
after damien white's death...
After his suicide...
because it's even cooler.
In fact zephco's stock
has tripled since the suicide.
So if damien white's death
means anything to you,
Then don't buy kok.
( Chuckles )
but that'll never happen.
Because you believe
in the dream, the fantasy.
Buy kok. Become perfect.
Scat!
What are you doing?
Just going for a walk.
- That's true because you'll keep buying.
- Grand exit?
When will you realize,
when will people understand...
Yeah.
That it's all fake?
Don't you ( beeps ) get it?
None of this is real,
it's all fake.
The entire thing is fake.
Let me... let me explain
something to you.
If you live in a medium-sized
city, you see 800 ads...
You ruined all this for me.
Michael.
That's my name.
What's your real name?
And you're so used to this, you don't
even unders... you don't... you don't...
You don't realize it,
But your body does.
Your heart rate increases,
your pupils dilate.
Your breathing becomes faster
and you become alert.
Because you've been tapped.
My name is six.
Looking at a billboard.
Is supposed to feel
like love at first sight.
But it's not. It's not real.
None of it's real.
It's marketing.
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you, six.
Without marketing,
you wouldn't know who you are.
Maybe...
Sometimes you need
to walk away from that.
Because you haven't been changed.
And you haven't been perfected.
You're just drinking
the same old stuff.
Just...
A lost soul who's
still drinking...
Syrup.
