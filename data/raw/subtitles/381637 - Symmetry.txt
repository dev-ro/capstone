as the assaliant.

- In Warsaw.
I'm arresting you for assault.
The victim recognised you.
Where were you at 9:40 Pm?
I was at the cinema.
- Who were you with?
- On my own.
I always go
to the cinema alone.
Have you got any witnesses?
Have you met anybody?
Have you still got the ticket?
I don't know.
Haven't met anybody.
Why should I keep the ticket?
Can anybody confirm your story?
I don't think so.
I really haven't done anything.
Then why the victim says it was you?
She's positive that it was you.
Give me one reason
why we shouldn't believe her?
What do you do?
Do you work?
- I'm a graduate. I'm looking for a job.
- So extra money would help, right?
I haven't done anything!
The prosecutor will decide.
I've got a feeling
it's not looking good for you.
Can I make a phonecall?
- Hi, where're you from?
- Mokotow.
I'm from Targowek.
- Zborek.
- Lukasz.
What they got you in for?
I'm in for ringing cars.
They fitted me up
on an assault charge.
Fitted you up?
You're done for mugging
which means you'll do a year
even before
the trial comes up.
That's paranoid!!!
- You clicking up?
- Do what?
Clicking up.
Or are you a wanker?
Am I what?
- Wanna be a reg or a wanker?
- I'm definitely not a wanker!
You need to get
syndicated then.
Say no when the tutor
tries to send you to the wankers.
What is in the reg-cell?
You are the convict!
The cream of the prison...
You'll see
when you get there.
Wankers get no respect.
You'll see on the visit.
When the reg comes in
he walks tall.
And wankers aren't noticed.
Hey oldy,
are you syndicated?
Can't you fucking hear me?
Head run, you!
Wanker!
That's your bunk.
- Machnacki
- That's me.
pack your kit.
You're going up on a wing.
- Name?
- Lukasz Machnacki.
You are a graduate.
What field?
Geography.
That's interesting.
And what are you doing in here?
Your files say
that you plead not guilty.
There's been a mistake.
That's no down to me.
My job is to allocate you some place.
Where shall we put you?
The kitchen?
You'll be all right in there.
- I wanna get syndicated.
- What?
Do you realise what that is?
You couldn't handle it in there!
I wanna go there anyway.
If you've decided already...
Hey, officer!
You wanna get syndicated?
You'll see what the reg-cell is like.
You're gonna end up
down the harem in no time!
What are you in for?
Assault.
Article 10.
- Where are you from?
- Mokotow.
- Have you ever grassed on anybody?
- No.
There is a Prick
up your ass for grassing.
As a fish you'll be on the check.
I'll teach you the rulez.
Roman will explain the rest.
This week
you'll be on every exercise.
We'll see if any con
yanks your coat.
Take that bunk.
Hey, fish! Will you join me
on my bunk tonight?
Are you up
for a fight tonight, fish?
We'll beat each other up a bit?
All right?
You ask whether they "hit"
which means eat or drink.
If nobody hits, you can go
to the nook, lift the lid
and warn us when it's open.
Then you can take a piss.
You are not allowed to drink
or talk about the rulez at the time.
When you take a shit you say:
"Hardware on the way"
Once you flushed
you've got to close the lid.
You always have
to wash your flippers.
Fish, remember that fight,
don't you?
I do.
Supper.
Six in.
Watch and learn!
pick up the tea.
Keep hitting,
cause we'll fight until one is down.
Six in.
Come on to the square, fish.
I was winding you up.
We've been only checking you.
Get dressed up, kid.
I'll show you some rulez tomorrow.
police hour.
What is that?
You can hit without warning.
Sweep up!
Roll-call!
Six in.
Breakfast.
Get me a milk soup, fish!
Six in.
Guv'nor!
Did you get the soup, fish?
He just shut the gate.
I don't care!
Either a soup or something else!
You got a nice watch.
- Give it to me and we're square!
- Can't give it to you.
Don't be so fucking senimental.
Sentimental, you moron.
I know what I meant!
Give me the fucking watch!
You're not having it.
Come on.
I'll teach you some rulez...
That screw is the worst
cunt in the prison.
He used to be in a goon squad.
It's a special service unit
used for killing off riots.
One day he tuned up one thief.
Only because he stood up to him.
He was a good man.
I knew his mother on the street.
Go careful with that prat.
He made few cons hang themselves
in the past six months.
I've told you before!
Cut down on smoking!
Come on, fish.
Have a go!
Don't know how.
Try fish!
Come on.
You'll learn
in few months.
Are you bored, fish?
Wash up the plates!
Hurry up, Albert!
Machnacki,
you've got a visit!
Machnacki.
If I find any kite on you,
you'll wish you were a woman.
Can I have a ciggarete, Albert?
Don't have enough.
Good morning Mr. Machnacki.
I'll be representing you.
Good morning.
Your mother hired me
to get you out of here.
Get me out of here then.
I haven't got good news.
As far as I'm aware...
you're under susPicion of assault.
And the only witness is the woman
who recognized you as the offender.
It's a nightmare.
I haven't done anything!
She had a stroke and died
a few hours after.
You're charged with assault...
...with intent to murder.
This is crazy!
Can sb be locked up for no reason?
Unfortunately, yes.
Help me, please!
I'll do my best. Can't promise,
how long it is going to take.
You might stay in here for a while.
These cases can drag for months.
Hey, gov!
Can I go up to see the nurse?
I got some spots
on my Prick.
Don't fuck around, Albert?
You don't wanna be moved
to the third section do you?
You wouldn't like it, would you?
What the fuck are you staring at?
Is your arse hole itching?
Control yourself, Albert!
What?
It's a book application form, gov.
When will I get a reply?
What makes you so sure
you'll get one?
Do you know what you said
in your sleep?
No.
What did I say?
You woke up first Kosior.
You must remember.
"You hold him
and I'll call the police"
You can't be syndicated
anymore, can you?
Right, Kosior?
probably not.
pack your fucking kit
and get the hell out of here!
The fish got hit by the lamia.
Your post, Machnacki.
It's been opened.
probably
at the prosecutors's office.
You don't think
we opened it here, do you?
Take it.
I won't need it.
What section is out at the yard?
Which cells?
The first one.
Cells no 5, 6 and 7. What's up?
It's Traper from Wola.
Hi, Traper.
Hi, Adolf.
Is Zborek out there?
I'm Zborek.
What are you up to?
Are you from Targowek?
- Know Mietus? - Yeah.
We got a kite from Mietus
you grassed on your mates,
and you're a rat.
Stick it up your ass!!!
- You got a ticket!
- Go fuck yourself!
Off the bunks.
Smuggled.
I'm taking it.
You'll get kicked over too.
They've asked about you already.
Leave him alone, Albert!
You getting on my nerves.
What is a lamia?
It's a bad ghost that appears
to weak People,
sits on their chests
and strangles them.
Make a cuppa, Roman!
Can't you do it yourself?
Don't get fucking involved, fish!
Why do you let them
push you around?
I'm in here on an alimony
charge and avoiding the court.
For them it's not a criminal offence.
So I don't deserve any respect.
If I stood up they would've
put me to the wankers.
I only wanna do my time.
That's all.
Can't you do anything?
What can I do?
I'm not even rulez approved.
Forget the rulez.
What about the respect?
Who was in that framed Picture?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Who's?
Was that your wife?
I won't have anything to do
with that bitch.
It was my daughter.
I'm not even sure if she really is.
Cause my ex told me
I wasn't her real father.
I got letters
and that frame from her.
She says she wants to visit me.
But I think that my ex made her
do it to get money off me.
What are you yapping about?
Remember,
you're still being watched!
Don't mess with him.
Stop sucking up
to that tosser!
I've been
to the prosecutor's office!
Tell me, you haven't done it son,
for God sakes!
I've done nothing.
I was in the cinema.
They're just looking
for a scapegoat.
Promise me?
I Promise.
You know me!
Could I have done such a thing?
I'm sorry.
I had to hear it from you.
How are you getting on in here?
I was going to make a cheesecake
I wasn't sure if I was allowed...
- How are you getting on?
- I'm all right.
It's all right.
How are you?
Ola misses you so much.
She was gonna come and see you.
She shouldn't.
What am I supposed to tell her?
She keeps asking when she can come.
I'll be out soon.
Don't bring her here.
Some other time, maybe.
Stop crying mom.
Please don't.
My father left us
when my sister was young.
She'd be crying night and day.
I'll never forgive him for that.
Did you write back
to your daugter?
What for?
She needs this.
My sister escaped
from the house to find him.
She was writing letters.
And checked the mailbox
for two years.
Children just don't understand.
They blame themselves.
The reason she loves you
makes you her father.
Don't you get it, Roman?
You don't...
Hey fish, you're from Mokotow,
aren't you?
Yes. So what?
Fuck all!
Do you know People there?
Why?
Cause I'm gonna
smash your face in a sec!
What do you want?
Maybe you have cake
with a guv'nor and ride his prick?
Watch yourself!
You'd better watchout!
...and you'll have a sore ass!!!
Do you fancy any?
What do you have?
Focault, Huxley, Kempinski,
about templars, Bulhakow, H. Ball...
I don't know.
Read "Fear" by Kempinski
or "Schizophrenia".
I'll take "The Templars".
Ok.
Don't hit!
Take it any time.
Thanks.
They broke Cichy's hand
on wing seven.
How come?
Isn't he syndicated?
He wanted to have it broken.
What for?
There are different ways
to get into the sick-bay.
Some stab themselves,
some swallow things...
Why?
One day you'll understand.
To avoid a transfer, or the scale...
What?
The court.
Haven't I told you that yet?
Make a cuppa, Roman.
Your mates are good to you.
If you mix with Proper People
they'll look after you.
Don't start on me...
Tell him how you stabbed
your mate. Come on.
He was robbing me on the side
and I put him down. So what?
What are you in for, Siwy?
Innocence.
So am I.
Me too.
Don't wind him up.
Siwy's in for organised crime.
I'm from the street.
But the rats,
will always put you here.
- What you gonna get?
- No less then 15 I suppose.
I'm having a trial soon.
I'll find out then.
Albert, and you?
Two or three year bit
and I'm out.
You could finish Primary
school with an evening course.
Keep joking
and I'll surprise you one day.
And do what?
Set your mates on me again?
If I find out that you shooting
a move I'll yank your coat myself.
Really interesting.
That book.
Have you finished it?
I get through slowly.
Not enough time?
- Be still or you'll look
like a beetroot. - I'm still.
You fidget like you have
glass up your ass. Just a joke.
My mate was telling me the other day
about that bitch from the club.
She was drunk legless, so they
took her home and kePt her there.
There was drink involved,
some cocaine.
She started crying,
mentioned a boyfriend.
Wanted to go home.
And my mates locked her in.
Believe me, I hate this kind.
First she comes on to you
and suddenly she's a saint.
Anyway, they Punched her over
a bit and let her suck.
Too much drugs
so they could't get a hard on.
She sucked and sucked and saw no end.
And do you know,
what that whore told them!?
"Please fuck me boys
cause my mouth hurts already".
What a bitch, you know!
I don't feel sorry for her.
They all ask for...
Let go!
StoP talking crap
or I'll break your neck.
What happened to Dawid last night?
He's always so calm.
- You don't know why he's here?
- No.
Dawid used to give lectures
at the University.
You know, posh People,
family...
...Iovely wife.
phones off the hook.
What about Dawid?
Slaughtered him
with his bare hands.
How did he get caught?
Walked into the Police station.
What about his wife?
Visits him once a week.
Writes letters every day.
I saw them one day on a visit.
Never seen anything like that.
Eyes just for each other.
It's like they weren't there.
Like they were
somewhere else.
That's what love
is all about...
Don't hit.
Two.
Open.
- And you?
- Two.
Three for me.
Hold on!
Hitting
while it's open?
What, the fish broke the rule?
Now what?
What do we do?
It's time for a hooch!
I'll make it
with pleasure.
It's hooch time!
Have a nice meal.
pack your kit, Machnacki.
You're leaving.
Really?
Hurry up.
You've got 3 minutes.
- Ready?
- Yes.
Get your kit unpacked slowly.
Just kidding.
You don't like it here?
Your mail, Albert.
For me?
Who is it from?
Why are you
so fucking excited?
Did you get a first prize
in a poetry competition?
Have a look. Read it.
It's from a wicked girl.
We were together
but I dumped her.
You? Why is she
apologising then?
She wants to visit me.
Next Tuesday.
She might jerk you off under
the table unless the screw susses.
And then you'll get a ticket.
Listen,
the bird is stunning.
You would've gone off
if you saw her.
Nice boobs, great bum
and...
she likes it up her ass.
They like it down the harem, too!
You're just jealous.
I got overexcited.
Need to knock one out. Don't hit.
Get me out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
I'm trying my hardest.
The prosecutor won't even talk to me.
What am I supposed to do?
Be Patient.
I'm really trying.
Just hold on
a bit longer.
How long?
Maybe a few months.
Until the court appearance.
How long?
A few months.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You sure?
Nothing is wrong.
See a nurse.
She'll give you something.
- Are you staying in?
- Yes.
Are you breaking out?
I wasn't escaping.
How could I?
I don't know.
I'm not here.
Speak up.
Head run, Siwy!
Tell Siwy to head run
to the outside world.
Go on.
It's all right.
Cygan won't show up at the court.
Tell Blady to hold his mouth.
I'll cover for him.
He won't get anything.
All right Siwy.
Take care.
You too. Chill.
Give me the needle.
I need to hide it...
or I loose my visit.
Water, air, fire
and freedom.
You've Passed the test.
You've been approved.
Signed in.
Have a fag, Roman.
What would you like?
- Yellow, red or green one?
- I 'll have a yellow.
- Here.
- Thanks.
Now what? No visit?
It's my needle.
- Yours?
- Yes, mine.
Forget the books.
Lucky You. Get ready.
Did she wank you off?
No way. She couldn't.
We talked the whole time through.
She wants to see me
on a regular basis.
She got rid of her ex.
What a shithead.
She wondered how
she could've been with him.
Missed me,
you know what I mean?
If you saw her today
you would've passed out, I tell you.
Don't hit!
Hundred.
Thanks.
Very nice.
All together.
Seventy.
Seventy... all right, eighty.
- It was five here, right?
- Thirty.
Gone away.
I'm writing down.
- You're in court tomorrow.
- Yeah, right.
What about my frame?
Thrown away.
And the Picture?
Gone as well.
Pictures are allowed.
Skolko?
You got it.
Fifteen.
This week I'm on the train.
Wonder where to?
Ilawa or Mielecin.
Fuck! Stop guessing again.
Fucking clairvoiance!
It's a pity I'm going.
I've got used to this place.
Who you gonna get
instead of me I wonder?
Another lame probably.
- Have you got a fucking problem?
- Have you?
You're so quiet
when the screw's about.
- Don't let me hurt you.
- Do it then.
Cut it out.
At least until I'm gone.
Are you taking
Siwy's bunk?
I like it where I am.
I'll take the upper bunk then.
I'm pressing
his bunk.
What?
You know I'm entitled to it.
Go fuck yourself.
You're not one of us so shut up!
Any regrets?
Have you?
I've done nothing wrong.
Exactly. Do you regret,
having done nothing?
What about
"thou shalt not kill"?
That is why I'm here.
Murder is murder.
What am I in here for?
Where is the logic in it?
Tell me what a girl that was raped
by her father is to think.
What does "honor thy father..."
mean to her?
There is no logic
for her either.
The world makes no sense.
You have to figure it out for yourself.
Regret has nothing
to do with it.
You got a new arrival.
Who?
Likes children.
He knew where to put him.
press your bunk
and don't even purr!
She won't be
eating at the table!
Let the bitch
eat in the nook!
Can I swop this?
Sure.
This one.
It'll relax you.
Do you like
little girls, bitch?
Mr. Machnacki.
I've got good news for you.
They might be dropping your case.
The evidence is to shaky.
The witness isn't veracious
due to her state of mind.
Court will deal with your case
soon and it might be dropped.
Don't get in trouble in Prison,
you should be home soon.
Your mother and sister say hello.
You might be interested to know
that the nonce is getting out on bail.
A brick of fags
for tomorrow or you're fucked.
Wrong number!
Fuck with me
and you'll get squashed.
For tomorrow, get it?
No, I don't.
What the fuck?!
Got a Problem with my cellmate?
It's all right.
Lets go.
Thanks Pal.
Give me a break.
Only lames thank.
She said she had to come.
I couldn't do anything about it.
How is it going, sis?
How's school?
I got A recently.
I'm very Proud of you.
I miss you.
When will you be back?
Don't know yet.
Soon.
Will you be
at my birthday?
I'll try.
Promise me.
I don't want to be sad.
I Promise.
Everyone told me to say hello.
Piotr, Maria.
I haven't told grandma.
I said you went abroad.
She would've been too worried.
Why are they talking
through the window?
It's a penalty.
When you don't behave yourself.
Our staircase is being Painted.
And you remember Jarosik?
He lives at number 14.
He was in Prison too.
I've met him.
He wishes you all the best.
He never told anybody
that he was in jail. Only I was told.
He was ashamed of it
but now he says...
there is nothing to be ashamed of.
Go home mom, Please.
Ola I love you very much,
I've got to go.
I love you so much,
remember that.
He's getting out.
What?
The bitch can't just leave.
Let's hang him on the bars.
It'll look like a suicide.
- That's what I like to hear.
- It's murder though!
So? We can't let the beast go.
Do you really think,
he'll stop shagging little girls?
- What if it was your sister?
- Don't even say that!
I don't want to be involved in murder.
I'm nearly out.
Shut your hole
or we'll hang you as well.
Six in.
Officer!!!
Sorry I can't.
They found a body on first wing.
Suicide?
It's Possible.
He might've been helped too.
What happened?
I can see that something
has happened.
Nothing.
Don't lie to me.
I spoke to the lawyer.
You could've been out soon.
What have you done?
Think of us.
I do think about you.
You don't know how much.
It's different in here.
Some things you wouldn't understand...
even if you wanted.
Ola misses you.
She thinks you'll be at her birthday.
She's taking it very hard.
I pray for you everyday.
I'll wait for you to come out.
Son?!
My son!
Can I have a Pen
and a Piece of Paper, Please?
Dearest daughter,
I'm sorry...
