Sivan. Brother.
We come to talk a few words with Berivan.
You're a kind man.
We respect only you among Veysikan people
Berivan is yourwife.
We share the same sorrow.
Berivan and you are same for us.
Let us talk to our sister.
Don't let them talk. They killed our brothers.
Didn't you also kill our brothers?
We buried our pain with the dead.
You broke the peace.
We gave our sister to have truce.
But you're still enemies.
You shed a lot of blood, isn't that enough?
Tell me, hasn't your father
Hamo messed up the things again?
If Berivan is really guilty,
why do you still keep her?
Don't speak with them.
They try to mislead you.
If you listen to your father,
ourwives will become widows.
They are our enemies. They killed my brother.
Sivan, wait. Let us talk to our sister.
Berivan, be strong. Your brothers are behind you.
Hallilans haven't forgotten you.
No peace as long as Hamo lives.
Hamo must die, before it's too late.
Hostility won't end till all the enemies are destroyed.
Let's not deceive ourselves. Ither their blood or ours...
...will be shed. We were scarred. We gave them our sister.
Hamo's heart is full of hatred. He won't forget his sorrow.
Ven if he dies, thorns will grow on his grave.
Berivan will be suffering for everything.
- Shall we kill all Veysikans?
- Have you got a better idea?
We killed each other and what happened?
Truce was a chance.
If Berivan could have kids, things would be alright.
That's an excuse. Hamo is responsible for all.
Berivan is ill. Hamo must die.
Hamo must die. They must all die.
Sivan is our sister's husband.
He's willing for truce.
He protected Berivan only by himself
against all Veysikans.
If so, why didn't he allow us to speak to our sister?
He can't, even if he wants. He's our enemy but
still our sister's husband.
If he didn't listen to his father Hamo,
he would have sent Berivan back.
That would be hard to bear.
- What shall we do now?
- We'll try to talk again.
When Hallilans' Necirvan says to
Veysikans' Sivan that...
...he's their friend, when a man's enemy says that...
...he's a kind man, when a man's enemies praising him, then...
...this man should think about what kind of man he is.
Why didn't you shoot them,
why didn't you shed their blood?
Why?!
And you'll be strong. Against who?
Against us? To Veysikans?
Against babies you killed in yourwomb.
You were scared, Sivan. You changed Veysikan's blood...
...to a woman. - Beriwan is my wife. Your daughter-in-law.
And she is the honor of our family.
...to a woman. - Beriwan is my wife. Your daughter-in-law.
And she is the honor of our family.
She's a shame for our family. His brothers killed...
She's a shame for our family. His brothers killed...
...our brothers and our children.
Their sister is the same shit.
A Halilan won't give a kid to a Veysikan.
Berivan is an enemy, Sivan.
- We're wrong, father.
- You say, we're wrong?
- We're wrong, father.
- You say, we're wrong?
Yes, we broke the truce.
We sent gunmen upon Halilans.
Yes, we broke the truce.
We sent gunmen upon Halilans.
Yes, we broke the truce.
We sent gunmen upon Halilans.
It's not true. They broke the truce.
It's not true. They broke the truce.
Why didn't Berivan bear a child?
It's the same to kill a child...
...when he's born orwhen he's 20.
Can a woman kill her own child?
Berivan is ill. She needs help.
Let's say the first one died of illness.
What about the...
...second, the third?
Did all the children died because of illness?
- Berivan is ill.
- Let her die then...
My brothers died, my son died
my nieces died...
...and god knows how many of us will die...
Let her be dead too.
And she's no daughter-in-law to me.
She's an enemy.
You'll get that too but it will be too late.
You'll get that too but it will be too late.
Berivan is my wife, father...
Berivan is my wife, father...
Berivan is reason for yourweakness.
You were like a falcon.
Now you're no different than an old jackal.
You degraded Veysikans' name because of her.
You degraded Veysikans' name because of her.
You're my father. Be merciful. I respect you.
You're my father. Be merciful. I respect you.
Let us leave so you can get rid of us.
Let us leave so you can get rid of us.
- Where will you go?
- Wherever.
- Where will you go?
- Wherever.
Go. Halilans takes you. Go to them, Give up.
Go. Halilans takes you. Go to them, Give up.
Tell them you're scared. Hide under Berivan's skirt.
Tell them you're scared. Hide under Berivan's skirt.
These words aren't fit for your tongue, father.
Sivan will leave, will you let him?
- He may leave, no problem.
- Why did you get up?
- I've had enough.
Sit down. See, what kind of son you got.
Sivan will go, because he hasn't got Veysikans' mind.
Sivan will go or...
...he'll send Berivan back to Halilans.
They both can't stay among us.
We'll see, if he will stay here or
go to Halilans.
- Sivan left us.
- Berivan is ill.
- You're on their side?
- I said, she's ill.
She's not ill. If you say it again I'll kill you.
Berivan isn't ill, She's a Halillan.
I wanted to allow your brothers but I couldn't.
If Silo wasn't there, I would have let them talk to you.
Berivan, you know how I love you. Help me.
If Silo wasn't there, I would have let them talk to you.
Berivan, you know how I love you. Help me.
Berivan, you know how I love you. Help me.
All the Veysikans are against us. Stop being silent.
All the Veysikans are against us. Stop being silent.
I can understand your sorrow. If you don't talk, I'm helpless.
Tell me about your pains. I want to share them.
Tell me about your pains. I want to share them.
Speak one word. That'll be enough.
Speak one word. That'll be enough.
I believe in you, Berivan. You've no fault.
One can't kill her own baby.
Father is blinded with hostility.
Berivan, believe me, you'll be cured,
we'll have babies.
Berivan, believe me, you'll be cured,
we'll have babies.
Veysikans, will be ashamed of what
they've done to you.
Veysikans, will be ashamed of what
they've done to you.
Tell me one word, that's all I ask you. Say, I'm ill orwell.
I'll take you to a doctor.
Local healers won't help.
We'll go to a doctor in town.
I'll look for a job.
The fields are ploughed now.
Cattle-breeding is dead.
People move to cities.
A friend promised me for a job.
People move to cities.
A friend promised me for a job.
He asked some money. We pay him.
We sell the rifle.
He asked some money. We pay him.
We sell the rifle.
One gun is allright in city. Our troubles will end.
I believe in you, I love you, I gave my heart to you.
Speak with me, even if it's only a word.
Speak. Don't be so stubborn.
Tell me your troubles!
It's a year now you haven't said a word.
Say something! Speak!
Say, I'm ill. Shout!
Speak. Open your mouth, make a sound.
Scold or snarl!
If you don't speak,
then shout, cry!
Shout. Say, stop. Say, enough.
Your efforts won't help. She's a Halillan.
A Veysikan like you can't overcome
a Halilan obstinacy.
She's ill. Can't you see?
She's beaten without a word.
Can't you see, she's ill, ill.
She's not ill, she's a Halillan, an enemy,
You don't be sorry for an enemy's illness and...
...you don't believe an enemy.
The peddler gives raisins for them.
He won't give a meter of rubber band.
These are stones.
- Where did you find them?
- In a cave.
- What cave?
- Near the rock.
Silo. They've shot Cindi, did you hear?
Who is Cindi?
Durmaz Agha's son.
They shot the immigrants for high pasture rents.
- You take these?
- What are they?
There are pictures and writing on them.
These are ordinary stones. I'll give you 2 kilos delight.
Make it 1 kilo delight and 1 kilo raisins.
Okay, I'll do as you wish.
If you got a job in town, you eat this everyday.
You always dream of cities.
- A present from me.
- Why?
You helped me a lot, I know you for a long time.
You never give anything anyone unless you benefit.
There must be something behind it. Speak.
- I'm a messenger.
- Whose messenger?
- Halillans' Necirvan says...
- What did Necirvan said!!
As I said in the beginning,
I'm just a messenger...
As I said in the beginning,
I'm just a messenger...
They say that.
We respect Hamo, he's our sister's father.
They say that.
We respect Hamo, he's our sister's father.
Let's end this hostility.
Our sister Berivan is ill.
They ask your permission to visit her.
I don't want messengers.
Never come here again.
I don't want messengers.
Never come here again.
- I just wanted to...
- What?
- I just wanted to...
- What?
We made the father angry.
I wanted to make a good thing.
Never mind him, he's our father.
You know a doctor at the town?
On Friday I'll take Berivan to a doctor in town.
I need a job too.
If I find a good job, I'll leave.
Cattle dealing is dying.
Right. Pastures are for planting now.
Machines are all over.
You're a wise man. Things are changing.
Hostility can change, right?
Necirvan doesn't want to fight. Neither you do.
...Get together and end it up.
- It's nothing I can help.
- If you want, they can't do anything.
Hard to say but father is mentally sick.
He still things Veysikans are strong,
but we're finished.
- Shall I tell this to Necirvan?
- No.
You wait for us on Friday, and take Berivan to a doctor.
Don't mess up whit them. They won't do anything.
- They'll shoot us.
- No, they won't
I talked to the doctor.
Will you allow Necirvan...
We have nothing to talk.
Don't you ever do something wrong.
- What is wrong with you?
- My wife is ill.
We got married, our first baby died.
She lost the second one.
The third one died too 2 hours after he was born.
- How old are you?
- 18.
Lie over there. Tell me what's wrong with you.
After the death of our third baby, Berivan stopped talking.
- Won't she ever speak?
- Not a word.
It's a year now. Maybe it's because of her sorrow.
She doesn't even speak with me.
She used to talk to her partridges, now she doesn't.
It's ever a year now, nothing happened.
We've been to healers.
Don't be shy. I'm a doctor. I've to examine you.
Berivan, let the doctor examine you. If we can't find...
...a remedy, what becomes us?
Don't be ashamed of the doctor.
At Military Service, doctor told us to put our pants down.
They even examined our asses. Berivan, let him examine you.
You won't let him, then tell him what bothers you.
Tell him where you have pains.
God, give me patience.
Why did we come here, Berivan?
If you have other intentions, your brothers are out there.
You want to go to them, then go.
Forgive me, Sir. Forgive our ignorance.
Maybe she allows next time. No, I didn't do anything.
You want to go to your brothers. There they are. Go.
Sivan, allow us to find a remedy for our sister.
Let us help you.
Abuzer, we don't want to fight.
You have a telegram from Ankara. They want the herd.
- You'd find a job for me.
- Aren't you going to Ankara?
I'm not sure if I'm going.
You need to pay 60 thousand lira to get that job.
I don't have that much money. I'll sell my gun for 30.
They want 60 thousand.
I'll come to see you.
Abuzer, don't act like a child.
- Sivan, tell your epileptic brother to behave.
We have a limits for our patience.
What are the limits for your patience?
Ither you let us speak with our sister or. If you...
...don't, tell us so. Let us talk to her.
Talk to her. And let's see the limits of your patience.
Berivan, you're the honor of our family. Forgive us.
We've done wrong to you.
Forgive us. Truce was a chance, a hope for all of us.
We failed. What can we do for you?
You can come back home.
If you want, we'll take you home now.
You want your husband Berivan? It's up to you.
Does your husband want you too?
Then there's nothing we can do.
Here, Sivan may need it. You're ill.
You've got no money.
It's up to you. God be with you.
- Silo, how do you feel?
- I'm fine.
Come on, he has something to tell you.
A man in town will pay you 500 bucks if you show...
...him where you found those tablets.
- What were they?
- Tourists buy them.
They use it to clean their feet in bathroom.
- How many more are there?
- Some more.
- I don't know how many.
- A lot?
- What will you do with them?
- I'll pay you 500 bucks.
If there are a lot I pay 500 bucks., if not, 20 for each.
I'll bring you as many as find, but I don't tell you their place...
...and don't talk about this to the others.
20 lira isn't enough. 25.
I'll deliver at daybreak and get my money.
It's a deal. Make it quick.
Your herd will be in Ankara soon.
Silo, you'll go to Ankara with money in your pocket.
'Mr Hamo Veysikan. As we agreed,
200 sheep must be in Ankara...
...as of 1. of the coming month. You'll be responsible...
...for the delay. I wish you a good journey. Stop. Celil Taç. '
In fact we lose.
I'll tell you.
- What are you doing?
- We're leaving.
- Does father know it?
- No.
- Is it true what Abuzer says?
- True.
You'll leave. Right at the time we deliver the herd?
You won't need me.
You say, I'm not a Veysikan,
I'm a Halillan, Halillan's servant.
Accept it as you like. I'm at the end of my patience.
Accept it as you like. I'm at the end of my patience.
You made me and Berivan suffer all those years.
You made me and Berivan suffer all those years.
We are going and this is my last word.
- Won't you come with us?
- I won't.
This is Veysikans' last chance. We'll take clan's herd...
...to Ankara. We promised 200 sheep.
We got paid for it.
We spent the money.
We decided to take 370 sheep.
If we sell 170 sheep, we can survive the winter.
If we can't, we starve in winter.
You have to come with us.
- I have conditions.
- What are they?
1, If I come this will be the last time.
2., I'll take Berivan with us too.
1, If I come this will be the last time.
2., I'll take Berivan with us too.
- Why Berivan?
- She's sick, she needs care.
- Why Berivan?
- She's sick, she needs care.
I must take her to a doctor.
And I get 10,000 lira...
...when we get to Ankara.
I leave my share to you.
10.000 Lira?
To take Berivan to doctor Then I'll leave you.
We've got no money. I'll settle in town.
I'm a stranger among you. Berivan is very ill.
If she dies, you'll all be responsible for it.
Come with me. Come
Come with me. Let's talk.
Listen, Berivan shouldn't come whit us.
She brings bad luck.
Berivan doesn't bring bad luck.
She's helpless.
If she comes, we'll be ruined.
The herd is clan's last hope.
- If she doesn't come, I won't come.
- God damn you.
I'll accept your conditions to get rid of you and Berivan.
God damn you and Berivan.

Okay, Silo.
- Where is Sivan going?
- To the station.
The train leaves the day after tomorrow.
If he knew how valuable they were.
He won't talk. Because he'll keep his money for himself.
They paid us 6 months ago. Who'll pay the increase? We.
We've got 370 sheep.
How many wagons do we need?
We need 4 wagons.
The herd will be in wagons 2 hours before.
...the train leaves.
- How many shepherds for4 cars?
- 4 or 5.
- Why Silo? He knows nothing.
- I'll learn.
4 of us will be enough. But Silo better come.
We've no profit on this deal. We've great loss.
We sold the sheep beforehand.
Then the prices went high.
- 2 shepherds are enough for 1 car.
- I want to go.
You go to the station with the herd, and return back...
...with our guns.
Abuzer, Sivan, Mirza and me will go to Ankara.
...with our guns.

You'll be cured.
I love you more than my own life.
Tell me you believe me. Help me.

This is for kidney. 3 times a day in water.
- Really? I thought of bad things.
- What?
You'll be cured when you take the medicine.
I thought you'll run away without me.
Are you crazy?
You won't go without Berivan?
It's a long journey and we're in trouble.
No way, Silo will replace Mirza.
If anyone else is wounded it would be better.
God, what's happening to us?
Silo. Silo.
I don't want to see you here again.
We're just passing, is it forbidden to pass from here?
This isn't a street. Do you think I'm stupid.
These two are sick.
Veterinary sent us.
370 sheep. Okay.
Take 2 sheep to my house.
The report is okay. We'll weigh the sheep.
And don't forget my share.
This wagon used to carry DDT.
Would that harm the sheep?
This wagon used to carry DDT.
Would that harm the sheep?
The men hardly gave us 2 sheep.
The men hardly gave us 2 sheep.
Ok. We'll be going with the sake of god.
- May I talk to you?
- I know what you've got to say.
Her mother's heart is broken. Just 5 minutes.
Not a minute. Nobody talks to anybody.
If they want they can take herwith them.
Berivan, we can't help it. Forgive us.
We wish no harm.
I hope you get well in Ankara and come back.
There is to go and not to come and
there is to return and not to find.
Forgive us Halillans. We did harm to you.
Berivan, be strong. You'll be cured.
Don't forget us.
The nomads are very stingy.
They gave 1 sheep for us.
Then we'll give them a lesson.
They do it on purpose. They'll harm the sheep.
That's too bad. 6 sheep has broken feet.
God knows, they did it on purpose.
Because they couldn't get enough sheep as bribe.
They have no mercy in their hearts.
They're all thieves.
Bandits used to be on mountains,
now they're in towns.
They have no mercy in their hearts.
They're all thieves.
They have no mercy in their hearts.
They're all thieves.
They have no mercy in their hearts.
They're all thieves.
Lets give two sheeps more.
Lets give two sheeps more.
No, do we have to pay more?
Do we have a way out?
Some of the sheep got ill. I don't understand it.
It happens at the beginning of the journey.
They'll get used to it.
500 horsemen stood on the road.
Bandits can't rule the world.
I suffered a long time in jail.
Sinop jail became our home.
Scape was the only way out for me.
Bandits can't rule the world.
What's your guilt brother?
To sing a song.
Thieves. Thieves.
Catch them, they're running away.
What kind of shepherds are you?
They'll take your pants...
...off your asses, and you won't know it.
God damn you!
Its not possible to entrust you a sheep, not even a stick.
Father, 3 sheep in my wagon is dead.
I told you not to bring her.
Berivan is the reason of all bad luck.
See, the sheep are stolen. The sheep are dead.
If the sheep are stolen or dead, why is Berivan guilty?
Her presence is enough for all the misfortune.
- You're being unfair.
- Why is this misfortune then?
Go to yourwife who brings bad luck.
Your place is her side.
Sleep, my gazelle.
Meatballs and bread, famous delicious meatballs.
Newspaper. Magazines. People stand
firm against fascism...
...we show you the games of imperialism
verything happened because of you,
because of yourwife.
You haven't listened to me.
Leave me alone.
They are my son and my daughter-in-law.
I can hit them or kill them.
Woman of ill omen. A shame to the family.
We're ruined. Our hopes are gone.
What shall we say to the cattle-dealers now?
God, why has this happened to us?
Don't cry, please. Verything will end.
We'll leave them.
Forgive me. He's my father. I can't hit him.
Nobody understands us.
Pretty woman, isn't she?
If you have taste and money.
- How much?
- 100 lira.
- 100 lira?
- For you, if you want.
- How shall we do it?
- Outside or in here.
- What if father sees?
- Nobody hears or sees.
Do it among the sheep. You can't have a chance like this.
This is for me. You pay the woman.
That wasn't the bargain. She's going.
She'll be back. I'm an honest man, don't worry.
Tell him to ride on the wagon in return,
and tell him that I'll give him 100 Liras.
Okay.
Old man say that, crippled woman is perfect in bed.
Silo, how are the sheep?
Is there anything wrong?
Don't get them stolen. Don't sleep.
I'll kill you all this time...
Maybe I find a job in Ankara.
Friends can help me.
I'll work hard and look after you.
You're ill, Berivan.
I'll see that you're cured.
I believe you and you must believe me.
Here we are. This is Ankara.
Our remedy is here.
Trust me, you'll be alright.
This is Ankara, our Capital.
In the Army they taught...
...us a marching song. 'Ankara beautiful Ankara.
Very person in need wants to see you'
This is our Capital.
Ankara is the heart of Turkey.
You've wasted the animals.
It was a misfortune.
We haven't know what to do.
You'll look after the sheep for a week.
Let them rest.
How can we feed them in the city.
Fodder costs a lot.
The clan waits for us, for their money.
Too many things happened.
The sheep got poisoned.
They were stolen.
Their feet are broken.
I lost money because of you.
You were late.
I couldn't deliver them at
the time I promised.
We had to bribe people. Animals were dead.
How shall we answer the clan?
It's none of my business.
You messed up my business.
Don't you have any conscience?
See, what they say.
You caused all that misfortune.
Have mercy. Don't you see how ill Berivan is?
You should think before you ruined the Veysikans.
No Veysikans anymore.
Now we are poor nomads.
Veysikans are dead.
I'm a Veysikan.
Veysikans' blood runs in my veins.
Go away and take your lousy Hallilan wife with you.
- We'll go but we've got money.
- Neither do I.
Where is money, do we have money?
Berivan needs a doctor.
We talked about it.
We did, but how should I know
about this misfortune.
- Is it our fault?
- The fault is yourwife's.
This money isn't enough.
Give me 200 more.
At least I can take her to a doctor.
Where will you go?
Where we find you if need to be?
I'll be by Siddik in Gaziosmanpasa.
Silo, remember that.
I hope we don't need you.
- How do we go to Gaziosmanpasa?
- By taxi.
Don't cry. This is Ankara.
Remedy is here.
It was hard at first, it still is
but we don't complain.
Our condition is bad.
We can't get along with the family.
Father is old, unbearable. Berivan is ill.
I want to leave the family.
There's a job but I need 60,000.
With 60,000 you can do better things here.
We have friends here. They can help.
- Life is dead at our town.
- We are also dead.
We don't know what to do.
Berivan's illness worried us all.
We must get an appointment in the hospital.
We'll go early in the morning.
Life is different here.
Rich are rich, poor are poor.
But still it's different.
- I wish he settles down.
- It'll be easy here.
You find someone, bribe him.
Don't worry, we'll manage.
- That's not right, father.
- You always mess up things.
It's clear. You have no job, no home, no doctor.
No money to send me to school.
Sivan is just like you.
What is the basis of hit?
Honest, working people has nothing.
Few people has millions, billions.
Where do the efforts...
...of millions of workers go?
Who built this up?
I mean, the rich here are the same as Aghas there.
I'm sorry, this is the only place we can offer.
We'll have the porter's flat of this building.
If you come then, I'm sure you'll enjoy.
Come.
This is kitchen, here will be a button for bad smell.
This is bathroom, all white have a
bath as much as you can.
This is bedroom. No just one. This is for children.
This one is for guests.
This one is for servant.
You're dreaming. They hardly let you live here.
Who lives in these big flats? Sivan? You?
There are classes in community. Workers and...
...dominating classes, bourgeois, capitalists.
These people hold their capitals by using workers.
What class do you belong to, Sivan?
- We're from the Justice Party.
- Why
I don't know why.
None of the parties care for us.
Right. If you don't know a politician in Ankara...
...you can't do any kind of business.
Can we take Berivan to the hospital?
Berivan is very ill.
If we don't take her to an expert she'll die.
We went to the hospital, it was very crowded.
Here, one needs money for everything.
Can't we ask the cattle-dealers for help.
- What kind of help?
- Maybe they know someone.
Don't they have things to do? I can't ask them.
Give me some more money
to take her to a private doctor.
- You know nothing but money.
- You promised me 10,000.
- I don't have 10,000.
- Then give me 1,000.
Here is 500 lira, don't come to me for money anymore.
I asked my friends for a job for you.
- Thank you
There's a temporary job as a porter.
I'll take you tomorrow.
We'll go. How is Berivan?
She was alright today. Upstairs.
We've waited, it was crowded.
We see a private doctor.
We tell him our trouble.
You look well today.
You'll see, you'll be alright.
- You know a doctor?
- No.
- What's wrong with you?
- Berivan is ill.
- Let the patient speak.
- She doesn't speak.
Why?
- Since a year she doesn't speak.
- What's wrong with her?
We can't have babies.
One is dead, she lost the other.
Another one is dead after birth.
- Have you been to doctor?
- No.
Over there.
Lie over there. Doctorwill examine you.
Pull your dress up.
You think this is a game?
I never say that.
We've never seen a doctor. Berivan is shy.
Why? If you don't want to be touched,
why did you come?
And there is nothing left to be touched.
Verybody has a behavior,
- Not to the doctors.
Take this. If you change your mind, come again.
She'll sure take them.
- Let's go to tonight.
- Sen Ankara nightclub is good.
It's all right, you can go there.
Aren't you coming?
There's a meeting in Çatirören, I'll go there.
You hang with 5 girls. I'm all alone.
Can you teach me debauchery?
- I'll teach you.
- Is it difficult?
A pretty girl is walking in front of you.
What do you do?
You start coughing. You draw her attention.
She is walking. I cough behind her so she can see me.
You'll cough and you'll be friends.
My gazelle, be patient. We won't go back to the herd.
I believe Ankara will bring luck to us.
We'll have babies. We'll have a job. Right, Berivan?
Tell me you believe too. Our troubles will end.
Don't leave me alone. Say you believe.
Don't cry. Say you believe too.
Berivan. Berivan. Berivan.
How can we replace our loss? What do me tell people?
It's over, Hamo. Take the animals.
Sheep will be weighed.
Berivan is dead.
- What shall we do with her body?
- I need money to take her home.
She brought bad luck when she was alive.
Why take her body home?
We are already ruined.
I can't spend so much money.
I'll take Berivan home.
She's the reason of all misfortune. She died.
We got rid of her.
She killed the sheep and her babies.
Now she's dead. We'll send a telegram to Halillans.
So they'll get their dead. She was our daughter-in-law...
...when she was alive, not now when she's dead.
You're not a human. You're a madman.
You are a dotard old man.
- Are you against me?
- Yes, I am.
We're all responsible for Berivan's death.
A man without conscience like you isn't my father.
I'm a Veysikan. You can't talk to me like that.
A woman is dead. So what? Many people die.
- He's dead.
- He killed him.
Poor Berivan. What will you do now?
I'll send a telegram to Halillans.
- I'll tell them to come and speak to their sister.
- Come to speak?
They wanted to talk to their sister. They can talk now.
I don't carry her home because she's a Halillan.
She brought bad luck to Veysikans.
I can't pay money for coffin, for Hodja or fare.
I can't keep a corpse here.
What will I say now to the owners of the construction.
I send the telegram today, they'll be here in 2 days.
- It'll stink.
- All Halillans stink.
Dead or alive, they stink.
I can't keep the body here. I'll call police.
- They throw her out.
- I don't care.
Take your dead with you.
Take your dead away. I don't want a corpse here.
We tried to be friendly, is it so bad?
Stop it, man. Are you crazy?
You don't drag a dead body.
Come quick to talk to your sister. She's very ill.
Signed Hamo Veysikan.
