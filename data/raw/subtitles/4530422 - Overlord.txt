The British Empire
and the French Republic,
linked together
in their cause...
We shall never surrender.
Men and
women of the United States,
this is a momentous hour
in world history.
Soldiers, sailors and airmen
of the Allied Expeditionary
Force,
you are about to embark
upon the Great Crusade.
You will bring about
the destruction
of the German war machine.
The elimination
of Nazi tyranny
over the oppressed peoples
of Europe.
I have full confidence
in your skill in battle.
The eyes of the world
are upon you.
Hitler's already dead.
Short train ride
from Paris to Berlin,
and I get there
with this baby...
Pow!
We all go home.
That's a lot of boats!
I think I'd rather be up here.
Some Kraut bomber spots them
all squeezed together
like that,
take out 20 at a time.
Tougher to shoot down
a plane.
Hey, Rosenfeld!
More GIs die in planes
than boats. That's a fact.
Don't listen to Tibbet, Rosenfeld.
He's full of shit.
Hey, Grunauer!
How do you say "full of shit"
in German again?
I love that.
Hey.
Morton Chase.
I'm a photographer.
I heard the Sergeant say that
you were in Italy before this?
It's a great frame.
You mind if I snap
a couple pictures of you
looking out the window?
You know what I wouldn't mind,
Morton Chase,
is you taking your ass
back to your seat.
You making friends
already, pretty boy?
- You know that guy?
- No.
Corporal
from Baker Company.
Last minute transfer.
I heard he got put in with us
for popping a captain.
He pops his C.O.
and gets a ride with us, huh?
So, what did we do wrong?
Uh, Boyce. Gum?
What the fuck is this?
What's this, for luck?
Come on, man.
Shit, you're gonna need
more than that
when we hit the ground.
Can you give me
my chain, please?
Ain't gonna be nothing
like boot camp,
not with those Jerries
firing real ammo.
And, hell, Boyce, you hardly
made it out of boot alive.
No lucky charm in the world
is gonna turn you
into a soldier.
Are you finished?
Are you gonna give me
the fucking chain?
- I'm screwing with you.
- Thanks.
Where's our drop zone, Nez?
The village of Cielblanc,
France, Sergeant!
And what is our target,
Grunauer?
Radio-jamming tower
on top of the church
near the town center,
Sergeant!
And why would the Nazis
put a radio-jamming tower
on top of a church,
Private Boyce?
Because they...
Good Christ Almighty, Boyce.
They put it
on a church because
the Nazis are
rotten sons of bitches.
And rotten sons of bitches
will do anything they have to
to destroy everything
that is good in this world!
That is why we have to be
just as rotten as they are.
Am I clear?
Yes, Sergeant!
There are gonna be over
120,000 Allied soldiers
fighting their way
onto a French beach
in the name
of all that is good
and pure in this world.
Those men are gonna need
air support!
That support will not make it
through Jerry's defenses
if we do not get
that tower down by 0600.
So what do you have to do?
Our goddamn job, Sergeant!
That's right.
Your goddamn job.
Corporal Ford here has joined
as our explosives expert.
You are lucky to have him.
You will obey his commands
as if you heard
my own beautiful voice
coming from his lips.
Our drop is 90 minutes out.
- Coo-ree!
- Coo-ree!
We must be
getting close.
Hope nothing goes wrong.
We miss our drop and land
in the middle of
a German squad or something...
Nothing's gonna go wrong.
Because we both know
what the Nazis
are gonna do to a guy
named Rosenfeld.
Nothing's gonna go wrong.
It's just a little
Kraut hello, ladies.
Hold your seat and stay calm.
We jump
when the light tells us.
Isn't this fun, ladies?
Oh, shit!
Too much flak!
We're gonna have to drop
a couple of clicks south.
Copy that.
Didn't I tell you,
ladies,
I'd show you a good time?
We're gonna fucking die!
We're gonna fucking die!
Sarge, you got...
- Murphy!
- Medic!
Settle down!
This is why we're here.
This is the job.
Grunauer, sit down!
Goddamn it, sit down!
I can save him!
I can save him!
He's dead! Sit down!
Everybody sit down!
Oh, shit!
Red level! Stand up.
Hook up.
Square up that line!
Wait for green.
Oh, shit.
- See you on the ground.
- I'll be right behind you.
Jacob!
- I'll be right behind you.
- Okay.
Manual deploy!
Tibbet, go!
Rosenfeld!
Go!
Fuck.
Jacob?
Jacob?
Jacob?
Sarge.
Any of you Krauts
got a cigarette?
You got to be
shitting me. None of you?
Well, that's goddamn...
Shut up. It's over.
You just let him die.
He was dead
before he hit the ground.
He fucking knew that.
What are you talking about?
We could've...
Done shit.
There were ten of them,
and I've seen how you hold
that rifle.
The Sergeant
wasn't the mission.
We got to get that tower down
by 0600. Let's go.
Another click north,
we reach the rally point
at Cielblanc.
That's if the others
even made it.
- Did you see anyone?
- No, just you.
And Sergeant Rensin.
Boyce, you keep worrying
about dead bodies,
you're gonna be one.
Well, Corporal, I had
friends on that plane.
Yeah.
Well, friends die.
Corporal.
Flash.
Thunder.
Welcome to France.
Hey, fellas!
- Shh.
- Oh, sorry.
I was afraid it was just
gonna be us three.
He was afraid.
I was about to end it
if I had to listen
to Annie Oakley over here
for another minute.
Tibbet, how you doing
on explosives?
I'm good.
Please tell me you got more
than just Boyce with you.
Goddamn it. Sorry.
- You got your camera.
- Oh, jeez. Huh?
- You brought your camera.
- Yes.
- That made the jump?
- Yeah.
Wow, that's well-made.
- Thank you.
- You get scenic shots with it?
Uh, well, I think
they want me to take
some more of the action,
maybe get some scenes
from the frontline.
Can I see that?
I can use that.
Just be careful with this.
You know, it's a fragile...
It's like wearing a spotlight around your neck.
Sorry, man.
Any sign of Rosenfeld?
Saw Grunauer
about a mile east.
The Krauts had shot him
all to hell.
Shit. Not gonna be
nobody left to rally with.
Just keep smiling
through it, Tibbet.
Fuck France.
I bet you wish you were back
at Italy, huh, Corporal?
How'd you even end up
with us?
I don't know, Tibbet.
Why do you talk so much?
Some questions
don't have good answers.
I'm gonna put that
in my book, Corporal Ford.
Your book?
Yeah. I've been writing it
since we got stationed.
Is that what you're
always scribbling about?
Jesus, Dawson, I didn't
think a hick like you
knew enough letters
to make a sentence,
much less a fucking book.
My mama writes her cookbooks
for the church back home.
I figured
I'd try it over here.
All the stuff regular folks
don't know.
What goes on
from basic to here.
Sounds thrilling. Bet you'll
sell a million copies.
I'd buy one.
Thanks, buddy.
And, Chase, I was thinking
maybe me and you
could team up, use some
of your pictures in it.
That way, you get a cut
of the profits...
Boyce!
Boyce...
Boyce, walk on a line to me!
Boyce!
Where's Dawson?
- Where's Dawson?
- There is no Dawson.
Walk to me on a line like
you're on a fucking tightrope.
Fix your bayonet
and probe to my line.
Come on. We got to go!
Chase,
get right on his tracks.
Move it, keep coming.
Hey, hey, hey, get up.
Point your weapon that way.
Anyone want to come
over here and get me?
Use your rifle.
Light taps.
Not hard enough
to set off a mine.
Exactly how hard
is too hard?
You'll know.
Move it. We need to get
to the tree line.
He was there
and then he wasn't.
But you still are.
So get your head right.
We got a job to do.
What the hell is this?
A dog, maybe?
Oh. Smells like shit.
- What is that on it?
- Looks like an eyeball.
That's not normal.
Hey, turn off
the fucking light.
Jesus, sorry.
Goddamn it, doesn't matter
what it...
What it is.
That's not a dog.
Kind of looks
like a jackal.
- A jackal?
- Yeah, you know, Satan's dogs?
Patrol hell.
Rip the spirit
right out of your body
and take it straight
to the devil.
Where do you come up
with this shit?
What do you mean?
How do these things
pop into your head?
The Bible.
The Bible.
How many jackals
have you seen with a hoof?
That's exactly
my point.
This is not
your average jackal.
Hey!
Corporal,
what do we do?
She can't let anyone
know we're here.
Grab her. Grab her.
Easy. Easy, easy. Easy.
Boyce, official translator.
All right.
Our girl's a scavenger.
Cielblanc?
Is that your village?
Cielblanc?
Germans? Many Germans?
Here.
Boyce, tell her
to lead the way.
This?
Here.
Fucking Nazis.
Corporal? This is it.
What are we gonna find
in there?
Just an
aunt and kid brother.
Okay. We're gonna find out
if she's telling the truth.
Boyce, you stay here.
If she runs, shoot her.
Let's go.
No. No.
Girl tip them off?
No. I don't think
she likes the Germans
any more than we do.
Because they're pigs.
I needed to make sure
you weren't as well.
This way.
Oh, man,
that's beautiful.
Ooh la la la. Oui, oui.
Oh, you know,
we go to Eiffel Tower and all that shit.
What the hell is that?
My aunt. She's sick.
- Be quiet.
- Me?
Tell this kid not to do
creepy shit like that.
Is she gonna be a problem?
No.
She's very sick.
Bonjour.
A lot of Krauts
moving around out there.
Two buzzsaws by my count.
And that wall
is well fortified, too.
Everybody de-rig.
All the explosives and timers
on this table,
and I need a count.
Ma'am.
Have you been inside
that compound?
No.
The trucks go in and out,
but we are shot
if we go near it.
We'll have to clock their
patrols and scale it in a gap.
Oh, and hope that
there's not a firing squad
waiting for us
behind that wall?
We just need
enough time to place
the explosives on that tower.
Tibbet, if we could put you
in a good position,
you think you could keep
those buzzsaws off
Chase and I if they see us
dropping over?
Wait, what?
I mean, I can
buy you some time,
but once I start popping,
they're gonna be coming out
of every door.
I can't cover that.
Well, what if I...
I'm not sure that I'm the best
person to climb the tower.
Maybe I could go.
What are
they doing with them?
What they've done to so many.
To my parents.
- Oh, shit!
- Jesus Christ.
You can't stay here.
They patrol all night,
inspecting houses,
doing whatever they like.
We just need to stay here
till that tower comes down
in less than four hours.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Oh, Jesus!
We got to put a bell on this
little fucker, or something.
There's a lot of
soldiers out there
and there's only four of us.
So,
maybe we should wait.
See if more of our guys
show up first.
Pretty boy, you finally said
something smart.
- Thank you.
- Corporal, there is no sense
committing suicide
over some tower.
We all heard the Sergeant.
The planes can't provide
air support
to the beaches unless
we take the tower out.
- Oh, listen to you!
- Right?
All of a sudden
talking like a real soldier
there, Boyce.
And what are you prepared to
do to take out those Krauts?
Whatever I have to.
Whatever you have to.
And what is that exactly?
Tell me more.
What's your point, Tibbet?
My point is you couldn't
even kill a mouse,
could you?
Corporal, you've got to
hear this.
We had this mouse, he
gets in the barracks
back at base, right?
The thing's shitting
all over the place,
so Sarge, he orders
somebody to kill it.
So Boyce here,
he catches the thing
in his boot and he sets it
loose in a field.
But the mouse comes back
the next night,
and it's crapping all over
Sarge's pillow.
So Sarge, he has us
running up hills
all morning for that shit.
You're not built
for this, Boyce.
Even if you were, there's
10 Krauts to every one of us.
Tibbet, enough!
And go see if anyone else
made it to the rally point.
- Take Chase with you.
- Oh, goddamn it.
Chase, go. And be back here
at 0300.
What?
What?
It's all pops and clicks.
I don't understand
what you're saying.
He asked if
you wanted to play.
He thinks all Americans
play baseball.
Yeah, well, not this one.
Tell him to get a pool cue
and five bucks
and we'll be in business.
Chase, move it!
Ma'am?
Thank you.
I need you to go downstairs and
make sure everything stays clear.
Right, but Tibbet and Chase,
they probably need a little...
Boyce, go.
I told you my aunt was sick.
What happened to her?
I don't know.
Ask the Germans.
She hasn't spoken since I
got her back from the church.
I need to clean that.
Let's go!
I liked the story
about the mouse.
Your English is good.
I went
to university in London
to be a veterinarian.
Then the war came,
and everything changed.
That's Paul.
And I'm Chloe.
I'm Ed.
Your French
has a different sound.
My grandmother taught me.
She was from Haiti.
But she moved to the States.
She was in Louisiana.
I don't know Louisiana.
It's hot.
It's hot.
And, um,
there is no war there?
Not like this.
You said before that, um,
the Germans, they took
your parents?
Our father first.
A few weeks later
they come for our mother.
The German doctor,
he believes the tar
in the ground
has some kind of a power.
He calls it his science.
But it's just an excuse
to kill us.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Get up, you piece of shit.
You okay?
She is for now.
But none of you will be
for very long.
Don't worry about us, Franz.
I like our odds a whole lot
better than yours right now.
This is very nice.
Did your boss give this
to you
for hitting
your execution quota?
I need some kind of sack.
Boyce, you just put the whole
fucking mission at risk.
Corporal, we couldn't just
let her...
Shut up.
Go get Tibbet and Chase.
We got to move on that tower.
Oh, fuck!
Shit!
Jacob?
Shh. Be quiet.
We got to get
the hell out of here.
No, wait.
I'm sorry. Listen to me!
I have to pull it out, okay?
This might hurt. Sorry.
Come on. Come on.
What now?
Yeah, here.
Here. Cover us.
Hurry.
Come on.
It's been too long.
Ten bucks says
Boyce got himself grabbed.
Don't you got yourself a dog
to play with or something?
Jesus, Chase.
Enough with the camera.
No luck?
I sent him to you.
So it's my fault
Boyce didn't show up?
You said wait at the bridge.
I waited.
It's a miracle I even
kept Jughead here alive.
Hey! Some help!
What happened to him?
I found him
inside the church.
Krauts grabbed me
as soon as I hit the ground.
Woke up with all kinds of
shit stuck in me.
Inside the church? How did
you get inside the church?
On dead bodies.
Slow down. Slow down.
Listen to me. They're doing
experiments on them in there.
They're doing experiments
on the villagers!
- What?
- Just like her aunt.
They're burning people
with these flamethrowers,
and they're still moving,
the bodies...
And they're pumping tar
from the ground
into these cocoon things...
Breathe. Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?
She doesn't have a body
and she's still talking,
and I saw Rosenfeld...
Boyce!
Did you get eyes
on the tower compound?
- The tower base...
- Yeah.
...is below the ground.
But there's more than that
down there.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Look.
What the hell is that?
What is this shit?
What is that, German?
I don't understand German.
Do you understand German?
I don't speak German.
I'm simply
an officer for the Fuhrer.
I know nothing
of what the doctor does.
- Oh, you don't?
- No.
Well, I don't think that the, uh, private
here, I don't think he believes you.
I saw your men and the doctor
burn those people.
This is war, ja?
People die
in many unfortunate ways.
I'm sure your
corporal has killed
many people.
Oh, yeah. Hey.
Stay focused.
I'm on the clock here, Franz,
so if you don't tell me
what I need to know,
the private here is gonna
paint this room with you.
What do you do
with those people
that you take
into that church?
They have been given
a purpose.
Get her off!
Get her the fuck
out of here.
Ugh.
Sorry about that.
Now,
we don't need this
because it's got nothing
to do with us.
Fuck you.
Get him up.
- What are we doing now?
- Hoist him up.
- What?
- Hoist him up.
Nein. Nein.
Corporal, why do we need
to hoist him up for?
We know he's not gonna talk.
You said we have to move.
We have a mission, right?
Right?
You know
what I need to know.
What's inside that
compound wall of yours?
Men, weapons, everything.
Hmm?
Fuck you.
Hey, Franz...
I'm gonna win this one.
You're gonna fucking talk.
You're gonna fucking talk.
Ford!
- What?
- What the hell are we doing?
You think this asshole
deserves better?
We're not him!
You want to beat them,
you play just as dirty
as they do.
Now get the fuck back.
How many men you have
behind that wall?
How many troops
inside that compound?
Get the fuck out of here.
Three months ago, I was
cutting grass
in my front yard
and the mailman shows up
with a letter from the Army.
Now I'm here.
With no idea of where
I'm gonna end up.
If we can believe him,
they got at least
40 men inside the wall.
Forty? Well,
definitely that's too many.
Right? It's too many.
It'll make it tough
to slip by.
Tibbet'll have to keep them
busy long enough
for you and me
to rig that tower.
You still going
with that plan?
It's all we got.
You know,
there might be access
to the tower from inside.
I mean, I saw some kind of
operations room
when I was down there.
So we gotta fight our way
into the church
and then
fight our way out? No.
It's better to stay outside.
Sixty minutes until
they hit the beach.
You got a vehicle we can use?
You won't get it back.
My father kept one
in the garage.
Chase, go get the Kraut
ready to travel.
We're gonna use him
to draw a crowd.
Show me this garage.
Hey. Time to move.
Hey. Fella.
Wake up.
I think I'm gonna need
some help...
No! No! Stop it! Stop!
Let go! No!
Help!
Chase!
Hey, hey, hey.
Chase, Chase, Chase.
He was asleep.
He was asleep.
Goddamn it.
Shut up.
It's not your fault.
- Put pressure on it.
- Yeah, put pressure.
Is it bad? Is it bad?
Shh. Just look at me.
You're fine. You're fine.
- How's he doing?
- Chase.
Open your mouth, huh.
There you go.
Hey, Ed?
Don't let me die, okay?
You're not gonna die.
You're all right.
You're all right.
Pressure, put pressure.
Come on, Chase.
It's gonna be okay, son.
I don't feel good.
Stay down, stay down.
Chase, relax, relax, relax.
You're all right.
You're all right, Chase.
Just stay with us.
Look at me, Chase,
look at me.
Chase. Chase.
Where's my camera?
It's right here.
It's your camera.
Chase.
Chase.
Chase.
Let me put a bullet
in his fat Kraut face!
No, no, no, no,
we still need him.
I'll get you another one!
What are you doing?
Boyce, he's dead.
Rosenfeld, get these explosives
off the table. We need to move.
If they haven't heard us
by now, they just did.
Move it!
Keep moving. Move!
Boyce, explosives, now.
Come on. Air support
can't cover that beach
as long as that tower's
still up.
What are you
smiling at, buddy?
Holy Christ.
Uh...
You asked what the
serum was, Corporal.
I'm thirsty.
How do you...
How do you feel?
I feel really good.
Doesn't even hurt.
Not as bad
as it looks, I guess.
That's weird.
Add it to the list.
- Chase?
- Huh?
Can you stand up?
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa. Easy.
Is it hot in here?
I feel hot.
- Chase.
- Chase.
- Maybe you should sit down.
- My head hurts.
What the fuck?
Ed?
- Chase?
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.
- Jesus.
My head hurts.
Whoa, Chase.
Chase, sit down.
Jesus Christ, Chase!
Jesus Christ!
What's wrong with him?
I don't know.
Chase.
I'm gonna
fucking shoot him.
Corporal,
no, please.
Corporal, relax, please.
Chase.
Hey, pal.
Hey, Chase?
What did you do to me, Ed?
- What did you do?
- Chase, stop!
What just happened?
A Thousand-Year Reich
needs thousand-year soldiers.
You got to be
shitting me.
Boyce.
Boyce!
Hey. Hey.
It's over. It's over!
It's over! It wasn't him.
That was not Chase.
You hear me? It wasn't Chase.
Holy shit.
Does somebody want to tell me
what the fuck
is going on here?
- Paul.
- Goddamn it!
Chloe!
Chloe!
Fuck!
Get down!
No! Paul! Paul!
Chloe!
Fuck!
Paul!
Damn it!
We got to move. We take down
that tower right now.
Boyce, you and I are
climbing it.
Tibbet and Rosenfeld
will cover us.
Corporal, wait,
what about the kid?
Come on, we got to move!
Goddamn it!
They grabbed him
because of us. Wait, wait.
And the labs? The shit
they're doing down there?
That doesn't matter!
They're not our mission.
We take out the tower,
troops come in
and deal with whatever's
below ground later.
Her brother will be dead
by then.
You forget
what your job is, Private?
It's about more than
that now, Corporal!
Do I have to drag your ass
up that fucking tower?
Yes, you do. Because I'm not
leaving him down there.
I gave you an order!
No.
No.
No. No!
We have to do this!
You know we have to do this,
Corporal.
I can get us inside.
I can. I can get us inside!
We can blow the tower
from below.
We can destroy
their fucking labs!
We could grab the kid
as a bonus. Kill two birds.
If we do this,
our odds of walking
out of here
go down to nearly zero.
If we pull it off,
that walk back's
gonna feel a hell
of a lot sweeter.
And I can lead us
straight there.
Okay.
Tell me while we move.
There's an old drainage
line just east of the church.
The tunnel entrance
is down the slope.
- Right.
- And over here is the church.
Make sure you can
cover that entrance.
Here should give you
a good angle
on our bait
and those two buzzsaws.
You got to keep those
from getting wound up.
Be nice to have a friend to
keep any loose Krauts off me.
Yeah, I can cover
him while Boyce sneaks you in.
Okay.
You got to make sure
it feels like
the entire 101st is
laying down on them.
We need to pull as
many outside as we can.
The more they're bunched up
for us, the better.
- I'll take care of that.
- And be careful.
Gonna catch on at some
point it's just two guys.
Just buy us enough time down
below to get the ordnance set.
Then we'll rescue the kid.
- I think we can manage that.
- Yeah.
Good luck.
You keep your head down.
- You too, Ed.
- Yeah.
Hey.
Woulda made a hell
of a chapter
in Dawson's book, huh?
- Reloading!
- Hurry up, Rosenfeld, I need you!
Shit!
Come on, you fucker!
Door! Get the door!
Get the door!
Sounds like the package
did its job.
Hopefully those two
can pull the rest away.
Don't stop shooting.
It's a two-person gun,
you bastard!
Shit! Goddamn it!
Let's move.
Move!
Okay, where now?
I think the tower room
is down this way.
What about Paul?
We rig this place,
then we find your brother.
Listen, we'll find him.
Don't worry.
No. I don't have time
for that.
Chloe. Chloe!
She was never gonna wait.
Boyce, go get started
on those labs that you saw.
Boats on the beach
in 20 minutes.
I'm setting these timers
for 18.
Anybody still down here after
that is not making it out.
Go.
Paul?
Paul?
He said Paul was in there.
Hey. Paul's not in there.
Come on!
Come on. Come on!
- Tibbet!
- Oh, shit.
Move it! Move that ass! Go!
This is where they had Jacob.
Slow, slow, slow.
Paul?
- Paul?
- Chloe!
- Paul?
- Chloe!
Let's go. Let's go!
Hurry and get him up.
Let's go.
- Hurry up and get him out.
- No.
I have to finish this.
I have to finish this!
I'll catch up.
I'll catch up.
Be careful.
Go.
Chloe!
Go, Paul, go!
Hello, Corporal.
I had so hoped
to see you again,
Corporal.
I wanted to thank you...
...for helping me
become the man that I am.
This one, Corporal,
I'm going to win.
Shit.
Cover me!
Get down!
Stay down! Stay down!
What the hell
are you doing, kid?
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay, all right?
What do you think you are,
Stan Musial or something?
All right, look at me.
Hold onto me.
Rosenfeld, go!
Shit.
Rosenfeld!
Somebody's got to put
a fucking leash on this...
- Tibbet! Tibbet!
- Paul! Paul!
Chloe!
Come on, buddy.
Is the kid okay?
No more running around
for you, all right, kid?
Chloe, you see Ed or Ford?
I'm afraid I don't have
any of your rope.
But...
Where were we?
Oh, yes.
What's behind those walls?
Me.
Fuck you.
You know,
Corporal,
all that power in the tar...
...running beneath
French feet for centuries,
it just needed to be refined
by their bodies.
But they lacked
the vision to do it.
I am a god,
Corporal.
Germany will have
an invincible army.
This Reich, Hitler's
Thousand-Year Empire,
is going to
take over the world.
You like her, sweet Chloe?
I'll tell her goodbye for you.
How does it feel,
the blood of eternity
flowing through your veins?
Not so fucking great.
Boyce.
Ford.
Okay.
Let's get you up. Come on.
- We got to move.
- I'm good.
- You're good?
- I'm good, I'm good.
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Ford!
No, Ford, open the gate!
Listen to me.
Look at me. Ford. Hey.
Ford, look at me.
Ford.
Open the gate.
Open the gate,
we can fix it.
I didn't get the timer set
at the tower.
- You got to go take it down.
- I'll take it down, okay.
You just need
to open the gate.
Ford.
Ford, look at me.
Please open the gate.
Open the gate!
I was never getting back.
And this shit,
our side shouldn't
have it either.
It'll have to stay buried
down here with me.
You got to finish
the job, Boyce,
and blow this
whole fucking place up.
Go!
Ford, open the gate.
Ford, please!
There's still time! Ford!
Open the gate!
Ford! Ford, come on!
The tower, Private Boyce.
I think I'm done with this.
Thanks.
Under the command
of General Eisenhower,
Allied naval forces,
supported by
strong air forces,
began landing Allied armies
this morning
on the northern
coast of France.
This communique
will be repeated.
This is a momentous hour
in world history.
This is the invasion
of Hitler's Europe.
The zero hour
of the second front.
The men of General
Dwight Eisenhower
are leaving
their landing barges,
fighting their way
up the beaches
into the fortress
of Nazi Europe.
Yeah, Boyce!
They are moving in from
the sea to attack the enemy
under a mammoth cloud
of fighter planes
under a ceiling
of screaming shells
from Allied warships.
The first news flashes
do not say,
but a large proportion
of this assault
is believed to be in the hands
of America's men.
They unleashed the attack
side by side
with the British Tommies...
Ford?
You had plenty of explosive to
take the tower out above ground,
but you went below
to set the charges.
Yes, sir.
Why would you do something
like that, Private?
Corporal Ford thought
it was best.
The number of
enemy troops, he...
He didn't feel we'd be able to hold
them off long enough outside, sir.
Well, your corporal
made a hell of a good call.
I just wish he were here
for me to tell him that.
So do I, sir.
Go catch a breath.
We're gonna fold you
into Charlie Company.
At ease, Private.
Oh, Private?
Did you see anything else
when you were down there?
There's talk about
some kind of Kraut lab.
So if there's anything
down there
that's worth us digging
through all that rubble,
you'd let us know, right?
Just the tower control room.
But there's nothing
left of that, sir.
That's what I figured.
Good job, soldier.
You and your squad.
Thank you, sir.
No wilds.
Matchsticks, five.
Buttons, ten.
Are you ready? Ante up.
Including you, kid.
He throws two,
and I calls me that...
Finally got yourself a friend.
Hey!
Kid's bugging the hell
out of me.
All right. Two to you.
- You look better.
- Thanks.
Now I just got to
convince somebody
how I helped save the war.
Save the war?
All I saw was you missing
a bunch of Germans
with a machine gun.
Are you kidding?
I saved your ass out there.
Is that what happened?
I don't remember that.
Do you remember that?
No? That's what I thought.
Did you get your orders?
Yeah, they're putting us
in C Company.
Jesus Christ,
after all that?
I thought they would just
send us the fuck home.
Got a job to finish.
We got to get
Tibbet to Hitler.
And then pop!
We all go home.
