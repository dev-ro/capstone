Arnold!
Arnold!
Arnold!
Arnold!
Arnold!
Arnold!
Arnold!
LUNCH IS ON THE TABLE!
Arnold!
Where is that kid?
AAH!
AAH!
HA HA HA!
OH! Arnold, What
are you doing in...
I think my biggest problem
is being young and beautiful.
It's my biggest problem
because I've never been
young and beautiful.
Oh, I've been beautiful,
I've been young,
but never the twain
have met.
Not so as anyone
would notice.
A shrink acquaintance of mine
believes this to be
The root of my attraction
to a class of men
subtly described
as old and ugly.
He's underestimating
my wheedles.
See, a ugly person
who goes after a pretty person
Gets nothing but trouble,
But a pretty person
who goes after a ugly person
gets at least cab fare.
I ain't sayin' I never
fell for a pretty face.
But when LES JEUX
SONT FAITS,
Give me a toad
with a pot of gold,
I'll give you
three meals a day.
Ain't no toad
when the lights go down.
It's daylight
you got to watch out for.
A thing of beauty
is a joy till sunrise.
There's another group
you got to watch
your food stamps around.
THE HOPELESS.
They break down
into three major categories--
MARRIED,
JUST IN FOR THE WEEKEND,
TERMINALLY STRAIGHT.
Those affairs are the worst!
You go into them
with your eyes open,
knowing all the limitations,
accepting them maturely.
THEN WHAM, BAM!
You're writing letters
to DEAR ABBY
And burning black candles
at midnight.
And you ask yourself,
"what happened?"
I'll tell you.
You got what you wanted.
The person who thinks
they're mature enough
to handle an affair that's
hopeless from the beginning
Is the same person that keeps
gothic romance publishers
up to their tragic endings
in mink.
What do you think?
Gorgeous, HUH?
GIVE ME A BREAK.
It's still under construction.
For those of youse
what ain't yet guessed,
I am an entertainer,
or what's left of one.
I go by the name
Virginia Hamm.
Ain't that a kick
in the rubber parts?
You should hear some
of my former handles.
Anita Mann.
Fonda Boys.
Claire Voyant.
Fay Ways.
Bang Bang La Desh.
Yeah. I'm Among The Last
Of A Dying Breed.
Well, once the E.R.A.
And gay civil rights bills
have been passed,
me and mine will be swept
under the carpets
like the blacks done
to Amos, Andy, and Aunt Jemima.
That's all right.
With a voice
and a face like this,
I'm not worried.
I can always drive a cab.
You know, there are easier
things in life
than being a drag queen,
but I ain't got no choice.
See, um...
Try as I may,
I just can't walk in flats.
HA HA HA!
You know, there was
one guy once.
His name was Charlie.
He was everything
you could want in an affair
and more.
Oh, he was tall.
Handsome.
Rich.
Deaf.
The deafness was the "more."
He ain't never
yelled at me.
Never complained
if I snored.
All his friends
was nice and quiet.
I even learned me some
of that deaf sign language.
Oh, I...I remember some.
"COCKROACH."
means "FUCK."
Oh, this here's
my favorite.
MEANS "I LOVE YOU."
AND I DID, TOO,
BUT, UM...
NOT...
ENOUGH.
You know, in my life,
I've slept with more men
than are named or numbered
in the Bible,
old and new testaments
put together.
And not once has someone said,
"Arnold, I LOVE YOU."
That I could believe.
And I ask myself,
"DO YOU REALLY CARE?"
You know, the only
honest answer
I can give myself is "YES."
I care.
I care a great deal.
BUT    NOT    ENOUGH.
WHO WRITES THE WORDS
AND MUSIC?
FOR ALL THE GIRLIE SHOWS?
NO ONE CARES?

DAMES?*
You need a lift?
Great, thanks.
Going straight home?
No. Let's get a beer.
What's the dish?
MEN.
My life's work.
What's the gripe?
I ain't got one.
I've got three.
Good night, ladies.
Night-Night, DEAR.
I swear that queen
gives me gas.
OH. HA HA HA!
Let's go to the stud
for nightcaps.
And a quickie
with some stranger?
Count me out.
It's very relaxing.
I want more
out of life
than meeting
a pretty face
and sitting
on it.
Graphically put.
I never enjoy sex
with someone I know.
Our Lady
Of High Standards.
Cab! Night, Girls!
Night, Bertha!
Night, Bertha!
AAAAH, HOT PANTS?
HUH?
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT?
THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT?
HOT PANTS?
SMOKIN'?
HOT PANTS?
SMOKIN'?
TAKE YOUR FINE SELF HOME?
YOU LOOK MUCH BETTER
WITH TIME?
MY FEVER KEEPS GROWIN'?
GIRL, YOU BLOWIN' MY MIND?
IF YOU'RE THINKIN' OF LOSIN'
THAT FUNKY FEELING, DON'T?
YOU GOT TO USE
WHAT YOU GOT?
TO GET JUST WHAT YOU WANT?
HOT PANTS?
SMOKIN'?
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
Come with me.
I know what to do.
HOT PANTS?
MAKE YOU SURE OF YOURSELF?*
Aah! Aah!
Fucking Faggots!
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!
You god damn faggots!
Get lost!
I AM TIRED,
And I want to go home.
One drink.
One look.
I'm not goin'
in that back room.
Who asked you to?
WAKE UP, MAGGIE?
I THINK I GOT
SOMETHIN' TO SAY TO YOU?
IT'S LATE SEPTEMBER?
AND I REALLY SHOULD
BE BACK IN SCHOOL?
I think I feel
the call of the wild.
Oh, don't leave me
out here.
OH, MURRAY!
MURRAY! MURRAY!
OH, I FEEL
I'M BEING USED?
OH, MAGGIE, I COULDN'T HAVE
TRIED ANY MORE?
YOU RAN ME AWAY
FROM HOME?
JUST TO SAVE YOU
FROM BEING ALONE?
Thank You.
YOU STOLE MY HEART,
AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY HURT?*
Oh, god. I'm sorry.
Are you OK?
Fine. Yeah.
No permanent damage,
I hope...To your foot.
No. It's fine.
Good.
Excuse me.
Do you have a l--
GREAT.
Look, um...
Name's Ed Reiss.
My friends
call me Ed.
I'M
A Sagittarius.
HA!
What's so funny?
Some people
like to know
that stuff.
I don't believe
any of it myself.
You have
a great smile.
What's your name?
UH...Arnold.
What do your
friends call you?
Arnie Or Arn?
Arnold.
Well, nice
to meet you, Arnold.
Can I buy you
a drink?
I just, um...
SO WHAT ARE YOU?
Italian?
No. Uh....
Spanish?
Jewish.
Geez--I mean,
I never would
have guessed.
Not with those...
Dark, Romantic Eyes.
You wearing make-up?
No.
I mean,
I didn't think so.
You, um...
You here alone?
No. I'm with a friend.
He's in the back.
OH.
Is he your...
Oh, no! No!
Just a friend.
OH.
WELL...
How lucky for me.
I've got a car.
HA!
If you're going
to laugh
at everything
I say...
We're never going to
get to bed.
You really do
have beautiful eyes.
And you've got
some routine.
Anyone ever tell you
you've got a very sexy voice?
No, really! You do.
Is that natural,
or do you have a cold?
FATE HAS
THE WILL OF A WISP?
CRAZY AS A LOON...?*
I'd ask you back
to my place,
but my roommate
is straight.
He's not comfortable
with gays.
Where does
that leave you?
I date women, too.
I teach in brooklyn.
I keep an apartment
in the city, but I
really live upstate.
I've got a farm
where I spend
weekends, summers.
I grow all
my own vegetables.
You'd love the house.
It's a classic
american saltbox...
Lots of wood detail...
Franklin stove.
I'm restoring it myself.
Sounds beautiful.
So what do you do?
I'm a female impersonator.
Ha! No, I meant
for a living.
I'm a female
impersonator.
Does that bother you?
Not yet.
Wait. I'll
get a light.
No! Just...
You're shaking.
Am I?
Sorry.
Better?
MM-HMM.
We're having
an intimate dinner
at my place.
Why didn't you tell me
you were going out for love?
I better steal steaks
from the kitchen.
Who had time to shop?
Bertha Venatian!
I wonder which
apartment we'll keep.
We hardly need two.
We always be
at the farm.
The farm?
You can't
bring up children
in the city.
Queen Of The Delicatessen,
Virginia Hamm!
MMM!
[BUZZ]
[ALARM STOPS]
OHH...
MMM.
Happy two-week
anniversary.
Oh, Ed,
you remembered!
YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS?
A KISS IS STILL A KISS?
A SIGH IS JUST A SIGH?
THE FUNDAMENTAL
THINGS...?
Thanks, Roz.
AS TIME GOES BY?
That girl is
stealing your material.
You're
The Torch Singer.
THESE DAYS,
I ain't singing
anything bluer
than ZIP-A-DEE DOO-DAH.
When can
I meet him?
Soon.
You met
his friends?
We don't get out much,
if you know what I mean.
SHUT UP!
NO MATTER
WHAT THE FUTURE...?*
IT'S WONDERFUL?
IT'S MARVELOUS...?
Come on!
Watch your head
there.
And this first step
is a little, uh...
Broken.
IT'S AWFUL NICE,
IT'S PARADISE...?
[CRASH]
We got to work on that.
IT'S WHAT
I LOVE TO SEE?
YOU'VE MADE MY LIFE?
Good morning.
SO GLAMOROUS?
YOU CAN'T BLAME ME
FOR FEELING AMOROUS?
OH, IT'S WONDERFUL?
IT'S MARVELOUS?
THAT YOU SHOULD
CARE FOR ME?
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Aggghh!
Whooosh!
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!
Uuhhh!
IT'S WONDERFUL?
[SNORE]
IT'S MARVELOUS?
THAT YOU SHOULD CARE?
THAT YOU SHOULD
CARE FOR ME?
IT'S AWFUL NICE?
PARADISE...?*
I'LL DROP YOU OFF.
I'm Seeing Tom And
Janet For Dinner.
You didn't tell me
they called.
I forgot. Anyway,
I got to see them.
And you're seeing
Lisa and Michael
tomorrow night?
for bridge.
They got a friend in
from out of town.
I'll go as your friend
from out of town.
Only joking.
Guess I won't see you again
until the weekend.
My parents
have the farm.
I told you that.
So we'll hide out
at my place.
I've got to see
my folks.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Ed, why didn't
you call first?
I was worried.
OH!
Hi, Mom.
Happy Birthday,
SHEYNA TATELEH.
I can only
stay a minute.
The girls are in the car.
Charlotte got tickets to
some Off-Off-Broadway Theater.
It's experimental.
They keep their clothes ON.
Your father will call
after his Mason's meeting.
Your brother,
he'll call when he calls.
Are you redecorating?
Ahh, it's easier
than cleaning.
Don't be so funny.
Hey, you don't get
much light here.
I get indirect
semishade.
It's good
for the plants.
So's manure.
Don't shake.
It's cookies.
Ooooh!
Fancy, fancy!
New tablecloth?
I made it myself.
Took a class.
I'm going to make
napkins to match.
Like it?
Nice.
Pretty pattern, huh?
Very nice.
[HORN HONKS]
MAMA, THE LADIES!
What are you making?
Potato soup?
Don't! You'll
burn yourself!
Not like what
I make for your father.
With him...Boil a potato,
throw in salt and pepper.
You called it
daddy's potato water.
[HORN HONKING]
I'm coming already!
Why don't
you come with us?
Leave a note
for your friend.
We'll come back for cake.
You go. Have a good time.
Give my love to the ladies.
Many happy returns,
TATELEH.
Thanks, Ma.
While you're redecorating,
how about this wallpaper?
God damn.
[BUZZER]
Be right there.
NOW IT SEEMS?
THIS IS HOW
THE STORY ENDS?
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Yeah, one minute!
Just a second, um...
I THOUGHT FOR ONCE,
IT COULDN'T GO WRONG?
HI!
Oh...Hi.
My phone was ringing,
and I picked it up
Just in time to hear
someone hang up.
So I was gonna call,
but I figured,
why not come over?
It wasn't me.
Arnold, this isn't
a great time to talk.
I guess that wine
isn't my birthday
surprise.
Your Birthday!
You remembered.
OH, GOD!
Arnold, I'M SORRY.
What's the difference?
We're together
now, right?
Well...
I've got somebody
coming over.
I just want to
see you for a minute.
I understand.
What do you
understand?
You never let me
make the first move.
When I'm going to call,
there you are calling me.
ESP maybe.
Who you got
coming over?
Do I know him?
No.
How do you know?
I know lots of hims.
Battle Hymm
Of The Republic--
You're impossible.
What's wrong, Ed?
Not now, Arnold.
You can't expect me
to wait until you call.
I told you
to go out.
I CAN'T.
Well, I'm not
ready to make
that commitment.
If I have to
accept you going out,
then you have to
accept that I'm not!
You really are crazy!
I miss you.
I think about you
all the time.
I'm so damn horny!
You've got no right
to make me feel guilty.
I'm in love
with you.
If I can't see you,
I can bitch
about it.
[DOORBELL BUZZES]
Arnold.
Please.
Hello.
Hi, Laurel.
This is Arnold.
Of course!
Ed's talked about you.
I'm glad to meet you.
He's told me
all about you.
I've got to run now.
Allergies, I should
have my head examined.
Um, Just...
Arnold, Arnold.
Don't pretend
I never told you
about my relationships
with women.
I thought you meant
like sisters and aunts.
That's not funny.
You are really
dragging me
over the coals!
Why should I
be the only one here
with a barbecued ass?
Look, Arnold!
I am not like you!
Being gay
is what you are.
I'm not happy
living in a ghetto
of gay bars.
We've never done that.
I need to be proud.
HOW CAN SLEEPING
WITH A WOMAN
MAKE YOU PROUD
IF YOU KNOW
YOU'D RATHER
BE WITH A MAN?
THERE'S NO YOU
TO RESPECT!
I DON'T SEE
YOUR SELF-RESPECT.
WANT TO SEE
MY SELF-RESPECT?
HERE! HERE'S
MY SELF-RESPECT!
BUT NOT FOR ME?
THE LUCKY STARS ABOVE?
BUT NOT FOR ME?
WITH LOVE
TO LEAD THE WAY?
Hi. Can I buy
you a drink?
Oh, Fuck Off!
I WAS A FOOL TO FALL?
AND GET THAT WAY?*
Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse Me.
Pardon Me.
Sorry.
Hi. My name's Arnold.
It's my fault,
I'm sure.
OH, MY GOD!
[UNZIPS ZIPPER]
What am I gonna do...
With the beer can?
Well, at least I don't
have to cook
him breakfast.
And with
all the promotions,
mine can't be
far off.
How about
a nice girl?
He'll find one
when he's ready.
They don't come
along every day.
You tell 'em.
I picked a beautiful
girl to be your mother.
You tell 'em.
You want
some rice pudding?
No, Ma.
Nothing
for me, Ma.
Piece of cake?
I'm full.
So what's with
you, Arnold?
I'm not seeing Ed
anymore.
I meant work.
You call that work?
Betty, the boy
has to find
himself.
So let him
find himself.
I'd love a piece
of cheesecake.
Go to JUNIOR'S.
Can you use
some money?
I'm fine, dad.
Just till you're
on your feet.
I'm on my feet, Daddy.
YEAH, IN 6-INCH HEELS.
SOME BIG SHOT!
Excuse me.
They don't mean
anything, you know?
Then why
embarrass me
like that?
I make more
than daddy does.
They have trouble
understanding,
that's all.
There isn't anything
they wouldn't do for you.
Don't be mad at them.
I'm not mad.
I'm jealous.
You realize,
in all the years
that they've
been married,
the only time they
were ever separated
was when ma went
into the hospital
for that operation?
And what
did daddy do?
He slept on a chair
in the living room.
He wouldn't even
get into bed
without her.
And the way
they always
made us feel,
like we were the two
most important,
smartest,
most talented,
handsomest...
And it kills me
to think
that they look at me
and wonder
what they did wrong.
In all my born days,
and there have been plenty,
I never met
a real bisexual.
Please, not in front
of YOU-KNOW-WHO.
I'm not listening.
I'd like to see
a bisexual
who lived with
his boyfriend
and then saw his
girlfriend on the sly.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Is Arnold Beckoff--
You dant to
give them room?
[SPEAKING SPANISH]
Right. Come on.
Bet you
never thought
you'd see me
again, huh?
Hi.
You look terrific.
Really.
You've lost
a little weight, I see.
I'm sorry.
I guess, you're still
pretty angry, huh?
No, I'm not
still angry.
This here's
BRAND-NEW.
What are you
doin' here?
I just wanted
to talk.
Five months ago,
you checked out,
but at least
when you left, you left.
I told you that
I wanted us to be friends.
You mean a lot to me.
Don't get cute
with me, huh?
Maybe I shouldn't
have come,
But as long as
the harm's done,
Can't I just talk to you
until you're finished?
It's important
to me.
Just sit down.
So how's
your sex life?
It's great.
As good as with me?
Arnold,
I'm not so sure
that the sex we had
was always as good for me
as it was for you.
Sometimes it got
a little too
out of control.
And that's bad?
It's not
what I want.
It's funny...
That's what
I pray for.
I thought about
you a lot this summer.
A couple times,
I almost called you.
I even picked up
the phone once.
Yeah, so
what happened?
Well, uh,
I couldn't.
I love her, Arnold.
Oh, um, I had
a dream last night
that I want
to tell you about.
I mean, you like
that sort of stuff.
Anyway, um, I was--
I dreamt I was
at my parent's house,
and I got a rag,
and I soaked it
in turpentine,
put it inside
a plastic bag,
and put the bag
over my head.
UM...
Anyway, the phone
woke me in the morning.
It was Laurel.
Half of me's
listening to her.
The other half's
trying to figure out
this dream.
I felt dizzy,
so I went back to bed,
and there
on the pillow is...
You know,
the plastic bag...
with the
turpentine-soaked rag.
UM...
I couldn't
tell anyone--
You know--
Anybody about it.
I'm...
a little scared.
So what--Do you got
your car with you?
Yeah, um...
Do you want me
to drive you home?
Um, why don't you
get the car,
and I'll meet you
out front?
Oh.
So what now, huh?
Look. If I take him back now,
knowing all I do,
maybe I can
make it work...
With a little
understanding.
Maybe a SHRINK.
I could just let him
drive me home,
And then I could say,
"THE NEXT TIME
"YOU FEEL YOU HAVE TO
SAY I LOVE YOU TO SOMEONE,
SAY IT TO YOURSELF
AND SEE IF YOU BELIEVE IT."
That would go over his head.
I think it
went over mine.
I could
sneak out the back
and leave him
waitin' out in the cold.
If I start in again,
who's to say he's not gonna
keep this shit up, right?
I don't know.
Maybe it's what I want.
Maybe he's treating me
just the way I want him to.
What if it's me using him
to give me that
tragic torch singer status
I admire so in others?
Wouldn't that be a kick
in the rubber parts?
I love him.
What are you gonna do?
But do I love him enough?
What I?
This is enough.
Enough.
D?
? A?
M?
? E?
DAME?
WOO!
WOO!
I LOVE
A LINE OF BEAUTIFUL?
DAMES?*
[POP POP POP]
YAY!
YAY!
Oh, weren't they
wonderful, boys and girls?
YEAH!
YAY!
Especially the BOYS!
[AS MAE WEST]
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
The last time I saw
a basket like that,
it was around
Red Riding Hood's arm!
OH!
One more time.
OH!
I'll see you around,
and I'll
see you around.
Hey, where's Bette?
Bette?
Darling, I don't do Bette
without a cigarette.
Over here!
Oh, you mean Bette
as Baby Jane Hudson?
YAY!
YAY!
YAY!
YAY!

Pull It Out!
YEAH!
HEY, SIT ON THIS!
OH! OH!
GET OUT!
You boys,
show some respect.
Should I
carve a reminder
on your pretty
pink face?
Gregory...
Please.
I wasn't gonna
hurt him anyway.
I wanted
to teach him
a manner or two.
You all right, kid?
WHOA!
ROZ!
Put it in
my dressing room.
Peter, 1, 2...
LOVE?
FOR SALE?*
I see you're
all right.
I'm all right!
OK. Careful
with him!
HE'S A PERSON!
I used to be a person...
Straight
in the back.
It figures.
[MUMBLING]
Come on.
Come on.
God!
All right?
Yeah.
You can
dump him here.
All right.
Here. Thanks.
And close the door
on your way out.
Sure.
Ah...
If you have
an IQ over 30,
then there is no God.
Hi.
Hi.
Who are you?
I've got a better
one for you.
Who are you?
My name's Alan.
Arnold.
Do you remember
anything about
last night?
Not too much.
I don't
usually drink,
but you know how it is
around the holidays.
You and I met where?
Sit down.
I'll give you breakfast.
We met at
the club East 4th.
You seemed to be
having a little trouble.
You were the waiter.
I were
the entertainment.
Virginia Hamm.
Oh, you're kidding?
Anyway,
you're in Brooklyn.
The subway's up the block.
Turn right, three blocks.
And you don't have to
worry about anything.
I was a perfect
gentleman.
Thanks.
Shit.
Um, I have
a photo shoot today,
and I'm late.
Um, hello?
Listen,
I've got to run,
but I'll call you
later, ok?
Hello?
[APPLAUSE]
ONCE UPON A TIME?
IN OLDEN DAYS?
I SPENT MY AFTERNOONS
AT DEJEUNER?
EATING ALL DAY?
GENET?
I GOT SO LARGE?
AS LARGE AS A TRUCK?
THAT MY HUSBAND
THE BUCK?
TOOK OFF LIKE
A FUCK--A DUCK?
AND LEFT ME ALL ALONE?
WHAT BAD LUCK?
MY LIFE SUCK--SUNK?
IN A FUNK?
Boys.
I TRIED DIETS
AND DRILLS?
AND I SWALLOWED
SOME PILLS?
THAT MADE ME
A MANIAC?
I HAD GRAPEFRUIT
AND BROWN RICE?
AND SOYBEANS TO BOIL?
I ATE SEAWEED AND PARSL
AND PEANUTS?
NO OIL?
I EXERCISED MY FLABBY THIGHS
AND WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL?
I LOST SOME WEIGHT?
BUT EVERY SINGLE
BLOODY TIME?
THE POUNDAGE RETURNED
TO THE SCENE OF THE CRIME?
AND THEN
I TOOK IT ALL OFF?
AS EASILY AS
WHEN YOU HAVE A COLD?
YOU COUGH?
[COUGHING]
WHERE DID I BEGIN?
HOW DID I ATTAIN
THE GORGEOUS SHAPE?
THAT I'M IN?
AAH...
I PUKE?
SO DISCREETLY?
I DON'T MAKE A SOUND?
I PUKE?
AFTER DINNER,
I'M NEVER AROUND?
IT DOESN'T REEK
OF POLITESSE?
IT'S NOT THE NICEST THING,
I GUESS?
BUT IT TIGHTENS MY BELT?
AND IT MAKES ME
FEEL SVELTE?*
Exactly what I need.
Hi. You saw me
in the audience,
right?
Every queen saw in Harlem
YOU in the audience.
You were terrific.
A little weird,
but different.
Hello? I'm another person
in the world.
Hi. I hope you don't
mind me saying so,
but I prefer you
in men's clothes.
Well, thanks
for dropping by.
I brought you
something.
I couldn't help
noticing that
you liked them.
That was really
sweet. Thanks.
Look, can I take
you to dinner?
Make up for
last night?
Free chow.
You got my vote.
Maybe another time.
We really got to run.
I never did finish
my christmas shopping.
There's an All-Night
Sale At The Market.
What is wrong
with you?
What is wrong
with you?
You're full
of CHICKENSHIT!
THIS TIME,
THE DREAM'S ON ME?*
I came to new york
to be gay.
I don't have to tell you
the kind of reception
a 15-year-old boy
with cheek of tan
gets in the big apple.
All any guy I met
cared about
was my price tag
for the evening.
I needed affection
more than they
needed the money,
so I took it.
I'm 21, successful...
and still,
every guy I meet
takes one look at me,
and all
he wants is sex.
Every guy I meet
takes one look,
and all he wants
is conversation.
I wouldn't say ALL.
Morning.
What do you think?
Kate Smith, right?
Judy Canova.
I don't do her.
Gentlemen...
Don't worry.
We got cash.
YES!
What do you think?
Fabulous...
For canasta.
Wouldn't you gentlemen
feel more comfortable
in another store?
We're slumming
until Halston opens.
I'll try this.
No! No! Sir!
Don't look now,
but pretty boy
tracked you down again.
My God!
Will you stop?
Would you stop?
'Tis Love.
'Tis Love.
Him looking at you
like a 3-year-old
at his first
ice cream cake.
Honey, my calculus
isn't perfect,
but I can put
two and two together.
What I get is love.
May I help you, sir?
No.
Sir!
Do you have these
in a 16?
Arnold?
Yes?
Sorry.
Arnold?
Oh, My God!
I love the way
this drapes on you.
Arnold...
I can't think about
anybody but you.
I don't want to
see anybody but you.
I don't even want
to talk to anybody
else but you.
SO...
You going to
come out of there?
You want me
to break the door down?
I'm calling
the police!
Let me see that
in HIS size.
There are a couple
of things
we better
get straight first.
A--I want children.
B--If anyone asks,
I'm the pretty one.
Alan, where the hell
are you?
I had to make
a call.
OK.
I'm listening.
All right,
number three--
Wait. Wait.
[MUSIC PLAYS]
All right.
Let's go.
Come on.
Employment, husband.
Employment, wife.
I knew
we'd have to decide.
If we knew that,
we could have
our own kids.
What about age?
Write 54.
Let them break it up.
What aged child?
Old enough to dust.
That's all I care.
...THE STATION THAT'S DEDICATED
TO THE ONE YOU LOVE.
HERE COMES THE KIND OF STUFF
WE REALLY LIKE--
A 3-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.
A SPECIAL SONG FOR
A SPECIAL COUPLE.
For Arnold, with all
THE LOVE IN MY SOUL.
FROM ELLEN.
Alan!
Asshole! Alan!
Was that you?
For god's sake,
don't cry.
SOMEDAY...?
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
Hello, homewrecker.
Oh, hi, MA.
Mama, what's wrong?
Arnold, I'm sorry.
It's your father.
THIS TIME THE DREAM'S...?*
I'll be
right there, Mama.
[SPEAKING HEBREW]
Amen.
Amen.
Thank you
so much, rabbi.
Thank you all.
See you back
at the house.
Thanks so much
for coming so far.
You got off from school,
didn't you?
Thank you for coming
on such an awful day.
I'll be here
between your father
and your grandfather.
Phil, you're here
with your wife and children.
Tateleh, over here
with your wife and children.
A nice girl,
who knows?
Believe me, Ma,
I know.
God doesn't know.
My son knows!
Why are
the mirrors covered?
So we don't see the pain
in our faces.
Why are you
sitting on boxes?
To make sure
there's pain in our faces.
You told me
he was Jewish.
Out-Of-Town Jewish.
What will you do?
Are you going to
keep the house?
I'll teach out
the term,
put the house
up for sale,
and go live
in florida.
Why florida?
Phil and I are here.
That's what we do.
We go to florida.
My mother did it.
That's what we do.
We go to Florida.
I don't care
what "WE" do.
What do you
want to do?
I want to die.
Till then,
I'll go to Florida.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
[RING]
[RING]
Hello...
Oh, I woke you?
Good guess.
[COUGH COUGH]
Is this Arnold?
That's what
they tell me.
Who is that?
I don't know.
Well, speak up.
I'm a drag queen,
not a mind reader.
I don't know
you'd remember me.
We both know Ed Reiss.
We met at
his place once.
My name's Laurel.
Ed and I are lovers.
We thought you could visit us
for a few days.
Hello?
Are you with me?
I'm way ahead
of you.
Sorry, I't into
that kinky stuff.
Ed s
Whose idea was this?
We both like you
too.
But whose idea?
What's
the difference?
Ed values
your friendship,
And you never
see each other anymore.
I don't think this
is a good idea,
but thanks anyway.
We're going.
What? We are not.
Shut up.
We're going.
Isn't this civilized?
Guests up to
our country home
for the weekend.
We've had guests
before.
We can hardly
compare this
to having your sister,
her kids,
or your parents up.
Imagine. Hostess
to your lover's ex
and his new boyfriend.
Would you stop?
[HONK HONK HONK]
This is it.
Hi.
Hi.
You finally made it.
How you doing?
Look at you.
Hi.
Hi.
You look great.
THIS IS Laurel.
Arnold, Hi.
YOU'RE Alan.
Yeah.
You need help?
Oh, Thanks.
You got it? Good.
This is Laurel,
and, uh,
let's go on inside.
Hi.
How are you?
Come on in.
HA HA HA!
YEAH. HA HA HA!
SO...
Arnold, Ed tells me
you're a transsexual.
Transvestite.
I'm sorry.
That's all right.
Actually, I'm just
a Drag Queen.
I'm teaching
my classes computers.
It's an experimental
program.
Really?
He's even tried
teaching me,
but I'm baffled.
Hardware, software,
I can never remember
which is which.
Computers
are the opposite
of people.
With computers,
the software goes
into the hardware.
And with people--
All this food
has done me in.
What say
we hit the hay?
Eh?
Did you see how
he fawned over Alan
at dinner?
He practically cut
his steak for him.
No more than I
fawned over you.
The two of you
were lovers.
Little games and jealousies
are going to pop up.
Did you see how
he made a point
of running off
to bed early?
"ALL THAT FOOD'S
DONE ME IN."
If I had someone
as pretty as that
to go to bed with,
I wouldn't have
stayed up either.
He's pretty?
UH-HUH.
Don't you think
he's a little young?
UH-UH.
You hear the way
their bedsprings
were squeaking?
I think that I
do pretty well
in the squeaking
department.
Oh, you do, huh?
Making allowances
for wear and tear.
It's too early
in the race
to make a plea
for sympathy.
You want to race?
Ok. We'll race.
HA HA HA!
Jesus! Do you
hear that?
[BUMP BUMP BUMP]
Ooh, baby,
talk dirty to me.
Well go outside
and listen at their door.
Give my best
to the bisexuals.
Only he's bisexual.
She's straight.
Too bad.
Mixed marriages
never work.
So what
do you think?
About what?
Seeing Ed again
with me
to compare him to.
Is that what
we're doin' here?
He ain't so hot.
Not hot enough
to be the great
love of your life,
anyway.
I never said he was.
He's got
his good points.
He's Good-Natured,
Good-Looking, Good In Bed.
Good And Boring.
He's not
good and boring.
He's just
plain boring.
But you
loved him, right?
I guess so.
He loved you.
I see the way
he looks at you.
Why did you two
break up?
We wanted
different things.
Like what?
I wanted a husband.
He wanted a wife.
That was delicious,
Laurel.
Isn't she
a great cook...
besides
being beautiful?
Just delicious.
I bet I gained
five pounds.
Ed, why don't you
show them
our new
canning machine
in the barn?
Thanks.
I've seen the barn.
UH, Ed...
Why don't you
show it to Alan?
He's the real can
connoisseur in the family.
I'll stay
and help Laurel
with the dishes.
We need to compare
notes on you.
Uh, just what she's been waiting for.
Mind if I steal the brandy?
Come on.
Stuck with the dishes.
It's right up there.
Tell me about you.
That's the reason
we're here.
Is it?
Sure is.
Wasn't going to let
this opportunity
to meet my competition
go by.
I'm no competition.
I am.
So talk.
Why don't you
ask Arnold?
I'm sure he has lots
to say on the subject.
He says you're
a boring,
insensitive
old fool
who wouldn't know love
if it wore wings, diaper
and shot arrows
at your butt.
Anything you'd care to add?
No. That'll do.
What do you think?
I' think I'll reserve my judgement
until I can make a closer inspection.
Close enough?
You asked me
to sit in the hay,
not roll in it.
I think you're
very beautiful.
I thought
you were reformed.
You want me
to stop...
Just say so.
Do you?
I didn't think so.
Let's go.
I'm sorry you couldn't
stay for supper.
So are we.
Yes. It's a shame.
Laurel, Listen,
I'll call you.
Thanks.
Drive safe, OK?
What the hell's
wrong with you?
BYE.
Give us a call
any time.
Maybe we'll do it
again sometime.
Let's just
get out of here.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
[RING RING RING]
[RING RING RING]
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought
you weren't home,
and I was working
out some frustration.
And I thank you for it.
Come on in.
Is Alan here?
No. He had
some early appointments.
Are you all right?
I could use
some caffeine.
I can't believe
how I misjudged
your relationship
with Alan.
Actually, you're
so perfect together.
I'm certain you'll
work everything out.
I wasn't aware of anything
to work out.
You two didn't have words?
None we haven't used before.
You mean what happened between Ed
and Alan doesn't bother you at all?
What?
You blurted it out?
Just like that.
I thought he knew.
I meant it as a friendly remark.
With friends like her
who needs Divorce Court!
I thought you left him.
I thought it was because
somethin' I said .
You gonna
tell Laurel?
What I do is my business.
Ed told me about it after you
left. He was crying.
I was dumbfounded.
I didn't know which
one of us to comfort.
All you had to do was ask.
Ask you what?
Not to fool around.
And I wouldn've.
But you never asked me?
Cause I wanted you to
feel that you could.
You mean you wanted me
to feel that YOU could.
Just once in my life.
Couldn't an affair
go on the rocks
after the passion
wears off?
Your the one that wanted
this weekend. You wanted to know--
That doesn't mean
that's what I wanted.
That doesn't mean
I'm necessarily ready for it.
You want me
seeing other men?
No, but feel
you can.
I do
and I did!
Just once, I'd like
to be on sure ground
When the blow hits,
instead of crawling
like a baby.
I want to
ask you something.
The answer's yes.
You don't know
the question.
I'm too tired to argue
any more, so my answer's yes.
Good...
Because I love
you, too.
That's it, Alan.
Pour the man
some champagne.
Don't give him
a bath.
Alan, give me a smile.
Wonderful.
Yes.
Hi, Arnold.
Alan, take five.
Shelley, stay there.
Shelley, come
over here.
Yeah. Fix that
little spot over there.
Bad news?
What?
Who's the letter from?
Laurel. They're
getting married.
You're kidding.
"We figured, two years
after that wonderful
weekend, ha ha ha,
"Survive that,
we could make it
through anything,
so we're tying the knot."
I think we should
take their example
and get married.
Yeah. Sure.
Any day now a giant stock is
going to come rapping on our door.
With a bundle
of joy.
I think the kid deserves
legitimate parents.
What are you talking about?
The Institute called.
We're going to
have a baby!
You mean?
Yeah.
We have to find
an apartment fast.
They won't give him
to us
until we have a place, where he
can have a room of his own room.
His name is David, he's 15,
troubled, abused.
He's also gay.
OY!
So, will you?
What?
Marry me.
[ARF ARF ARF]
[CAR HORN HONKS]
[HONK HONK HONK]
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Welcome to
the neighborhood.
Fabulous!
Really terrific
neighborhood
you picked here.
It's barely dark,
and they're
out in numbers.
Maybe we should get an infared
telescope for the living room.
Great way to
bring up a child.
Lift.
Are we going to
have a dog?
Why? What for?
For the kid.
That's a great idea.
What kind
should we get?
The kind that walks
in the park.
You're a funny guy.
Real funny.
Wait. Ok.
Push. Ok.
God, I feel
so butch.
Hey, should you be carrying
this in your condition?
Shouldn't you lying down with
your feet up or something?
You're starting to look
like a mother.
Gray hair and all.
I do not have
gray hair.
I see it from here.
Yeah, well you gave me
every one of 'em.
My old man.
What if
he hates us?
I'm hungry.
Let's go eat.
I'm tired.
Let's go to bed.
Where?
OOPS!
Why don't you
go get some take-out?
I'll see what I can do
with the bedroom.
Dinner in bed.
By candlelight?
Buy candles.
Sorry.
You fuckin' watch
where you're goin'.
Fuckin' faggot.
Hey, not
out here, man.
Alan!
Bring champagne.
CHA CHA CHA?*
What's going on?
Some punks are swinging bats.
They got some old guy cornered.
Call the cops.
They're
beating fags.
Think the cops
give a shit?
Call the cops! Now!
[TIRES SCREECH]
Over there.
Hey!
Hey!
Give me the bat.
Let him go.
Come on.
I said let him go.
Oh, geez.
[SIRENS]
There's nothing
you can do here.
OK.
Move it back.
Hey, you back there,
get back in the car.
Come on.
I don't know
what happened.
You'll read about it
in the morning. Come on.
Let's go.
Move it!
All right,
break it up.
Stop it!
Stop it!
Please, stop it!
STOP!
STOP!
I've called
your mothers.
Don't make a sound
until they get here.
Your mother?
Hey, I didn't say
nothing, lady.
You are going to
pay for this, young man.
How could you get into a
fight today? Of all days.
Believe me young man.
I won't soon forget this.
Yeah well. You think
I'll ever forget
you showin' up
in that outfit?
The called and told me you
were hurt in a fight.
What did you want me to do,
put on a tux?
[DOOR SLAMS]
Looks like he survived.
What are you
doing home?
Brooklyn Day.
My school's closed.
What died?
It's breakfast I
cooked it myself.
Toast for me I'm on a diet.
Since when?
1961.
We got a steak
I could put on my eye?
Use ice cubes.
Uh, and when I think of that kid
hittin' you. And for that
he gets two day's suspension.
I gotta go see
his principal.
What did you
fight about?
He called me
a douche bag.
So, I slugged him.
How Fifties.
Have a seat. Soup's on.
Here we go.
Ok, dig in.
This is a joke,
right?
I cooked.
You'll eat.
Care to join me
apartment-hunting?
What's the rush?
I like having
you here.
Can have
the ketchup?
The couch and I
are not speaking.
It's only
your fourth night.
You'll get
used to it.
Can I have
the mustard?
Is something wrong
with the food?
Not at all.
Very tasty.
How bout the mayo?
Hold the mayo.
Your wife called
in the middle
of the night.
I tried to wake you,
But you were
out of it.
I guess I better
call her.
Help yourself to seconds.
There's plenty.
And I was worried.
David, you finish
cleaning up your room?
Oh, what do I gotta clean for.
My mother. Tomorrow.
Coming here.
Lock the door.
Say it's a closet.
She doesn't know about me.
So why let in my room.
Who's on the phone?
Ed.
All right.
All right.
Yeah.
1:30 AT GREENFIELD'S.
Yep.
Ok. Bye-Bye.
She give you
a bad time, huh?
Four day's of those calls.
You'd think I'd start getting
used to them.
I don't know why
she always has to cry.
I mean, this separation
wasn't all my idea.
Ed! I don't want to hear
what you have to say.
Because believe me you don't want
to hear what I have to say.
Welp, I'd love to chewin'
the fat with you grown-up types,
but I got a life to live.
Take a glass of milk.
I had milk.
Then go brush your teeth.
Oh, Ma!
Don't you "Oh, Ma" Me.
March!
Don't call me Ma
in front of my Mother.
Having a good time,
Leonora?
Oh, Ed, two favors.
My mother wants
to go to the cemetery.
I need the number
of the car service you use.
And David's social worker
will be coming on Thursday.
So could you stay
somewhere else?
I'm good enough
for your mother,
but I'm not good enough
for David's social worker?
It's nothing to do with being
good enough. Ms. Schnabel Frowns
on casual cohabitation.
And I've got enough to explain
without you on the couch.
Casual? We've known each
other for nine years.
Seven of which you spent
with another woman.
But I'm sleeping
on the couch.
OK, maybe I should just
find a hotel room.
And leave me unprotected at
a time like this?
You know my Mother is not
going to exactly feature the
idea of my becoming a father.
Your professional opinion
an an American Educator
will prove invaluable.
She'll say
I'm prejudiced.
She'll say a lot a things,
you'll learn not to listen.
David, I'm leaving!
I'll miss you.
Make sure he calls
somebody for his homework.
No TV till it's done.
And bedtime 11PM sharp.
But, I got no school
tomorrow.
It's still a school night.
We'll be fine.
David!
Get over here!
What the hell is wrong with
you?
I don't get
no kiss good-bye?
Whoa!
I Love You.
I Love You, Too...
MA!
So the new career's
a reality.
Just don't forget who
your friends are.
You know, when I started,
in this business.
I looked like
a young Joan Crawford.
10 years later,
Marjorie Main.
I swear I'm aging about as well
as a beach party movie.
Umm, well I'm happy for you.
You've got it all.
Now, If that idiot Ed
would just settle down...
You must be dying for a slap.
That's about the last thing
I need in my life.
That's precisely my point. Ed
is the very last thing you need.
You've got the rest--
Nice apartment, good job,
money enough to keep your figure,
someone who depends on you.
Now what you need, is someone
on which you can depend.
Ed? Get real.
People change.
Alan DIED, HONEY,
NOT YOU.
BUT SEEING YOU IS GRAND?
AND YOU WERE SWEET
TO OFFER YOUR HAND?
I UNDERSTAND?
I DO?
PARDON MY ASKING,
"WHAT'S NEW?"?
OF COURSE,
YOU COULDN'T KNOW?
I HAVEN'T CHANGED?
I STILL LOVE YOU SO?
How Alice Faye
can I get?
IT'S 7:18
IN THE BIG APPLE.
THIS IS HIGH TIDE
WITH A DEDICATION
FROM BUTCHIE TO JUDY.
Should we wake him?
What if he oversleeps?
I'm not gonna survive!
He's up.
David, What are you doing in
that kitchen?
I cleaned until
5:00 in the morning!
Where am I supposed to eat?
You ever hear of a Restaurant.
They cook for you,
they clean for you,
and best of all My Mother
Don't Go There.
The suit should help soften
the blow.
It's for David's Principal.
What, no bunny slippers?
Ed, the phone number of
that car service?
What time do you
expect her?
I don't know. She said early
flight. I figure around noon.
David! Get over here.
Now listen to me.
I want you to cleanup
that kitchen.
Get your butt
to Murray's.
And don't come home
until I call you. Huh.
Yeah, Ma.
WHAT?
After all this time,
how could you have not
told her about David.
I toldmy mother about David.
But she assumed
he was my roommate.
I didn't bother
correcting her.
Alan had just died. And I never
even told her how he was killed.
She assumed it was a car accident.
I didn't bother correcting her.
Unbelievable.
What is so unbelievable.
You still haven't told
your parents that you're gay.
Bisexual. Thank you.
Yeah well, I told my mother
when I was 13.
You knew when you were 13?
Honey, when I was 13,
I knew everything.
Senility set in
sometime after.
Hello, Murray?
Hi. Listen...
I won't
be coming over today, man.
I got a temperature. And, em
Arnold told me
to stay here in bed.
Yeah, Oh it's terrible.
At least 102.
[COUGHS]
I got to go, Murray.
I'm very weak. Bye.
Is this a playground?
Thank You.
It was a pleasure
meeting you all,
none of whom
would give me a seat.
Thanks to you gentlemen.
I now have varicose veins.
Wait. I got it.
Hey! Help! Mugger!
What, I'm not a mugger.
Then you're a rapist.
Why would a rapist
wear a suit? Ou.
How do I know? Maybe you got
a wedding after.
Arnold had to go
somewhere.
So, I waited for you, incase
you got hear before him.
Oh. I'm sorry I kicked ya.
This is very, very nice
of you to meet me.
No sweat.
Arnold left you
his keys.
I got my own set.
Oh, Really?
This is probably
none of my business, and I
hope you don't mind my asking.
But just who the hell are you?
I'm David.
David.
The neighbor's kid?
I live with Arnold.
Would you like
a drink?
Maybe later.
Come on in.
We've got everything
all worked out for you,
even with Ed
staying here.
Ed?
Arnold's friend.
Friend friend
or euphemism friend?
He used to be
a euphemism.
Now he's just
a friend.
But with you stayin' here.
They'll both be sleeping
on the couch.
Who knows?
Have they got
water here?
Sure.
We cleaned all week
for you.
What do you think?
I think
we should sit down.
David,
you go to school?
Yeah.
Are these oranges
from florida?
Cuba.
We were hijacked.
But, I'm not one
to complain.
Funny.
So...You go
to college?
High school.
High school,
how nice.
Senior?
Freshman.
Freshman.
That's very sweet.
Tell me, David,
just how old are you?
16.
In two months.
Something wrong?
Not at all.
16 in two months.
That's wonderful.
You've got your life
ahead of you.
Mine is flashing
before my eyes.
More water?
More water.
David, darling...
Don't your parents think
you're a little young
to be on your own?
No.
But juvenile court did.
So here I am.
I need to talk
to Arnold.
You could call
the school.
He's with my principal.
Real people know
you live here?
Lots of people
live with their fathers.
Live with their what?
Their fathers!
Hi, Pop!
Tell me about Florida.
Anyone special
in your life?
Not particularly.
This Ed got married,
didn't he?
Right,ahh. So, how come
you're not seeing anyone?
Because the last thing I
need is to become nursemaid
to some ALTER KOCKER.
So, how come he's
staying with you?
He and his wife
are separated.
Separated. How come?
I don't know.
Arnold the man is living with
you. You're both staying
on the couch.
Cause your in my room!
You're involved.
Ma!
You must admit it
sounds a little queer.
A man leaves his wife
and moves in
with his old friend.
I don't think the people who
gave you David wouldn't approve.
You wanna jSust drive.
David is a tremendous
responsibility.
Set him a good example.
Giving a friend
a place to stay
is a bad example?
I knew I should have kept
my mouth to myself.
Anyway. It's only for a
few more weeks.
What?
You said he
was with you
on a one-year basis.
Then he leaves.
No. You misunderstood.
After the one year,
If we agree and
child welfare allows,
I'm going to
legally adopt him.
If I have
anything to say,
David's not leaving.
STOP THE CAR!
You've done
crazy things--
It is not crazy!
It is wonderful.
I am proud of it.
You were too ashamed
to tell your mother.
Everything else
you tell me.
You shove your sex life
down my throat. Every hour,
on the hour.
But all this time,
not a word. Why?
You know your not the easiest
person in the world
to talk to.
Why? What did I say?
Do I tell you how
to run your life.
Listen,to me my son.
I realized a long time ago,
you and your brother
would do as you felt.
You want to know why
you didn't tell me?
Because you knew
it was wrong.
That's not true!
No? Why?
I don't know!
So what else is new?
[RECITING KADDISH]
That's it!
Arnold honestly.
I've had it up to
here with you.
Your father left these plots to
you. This is what you want to do
with them, fine! That's your
business.
But I will not stand here and
watch you spit on your
father's grave!
What?
What do you think
you are doing?
What Are You Doing?
The same thing
you're doing.
No! I'm reciting KADDISH
for my husband.
Your blasfeming your religion.
We were married
for 35 years.
Your gonna compare my marriage
to you and Alan?
I MEAN THE LOSS.
What lose did you have?
You fooled around with some boy.
Where do you compare
that with a marriage
of 35 years?
Come on. I'm not
one of your pals.
I lost someone I loved.
So you felt bad.
Maybe you cried.
35 years I lived
with this man.
He got sick,
I took him
to the hospital.
I gave them a man.
They gave me a place
to visit on Holy days.
How could you know
how I felt?
It took two months
before I slept
in our bed.
IT TOOK A YEAR
BEFORE I COULD SAY
"I" INSTEAD OF "WE."
HOW DARE YOU?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
HOW DARE I?
I COULDN'T KNOW
HOW IT FEELS
TO PUT SOMEBODY'S THINGS
IN PLASTIC BAGS
AND WATCH GARBAGE MEN
TAKE THEM AWAY.
OR HOW IT FEELS
WHEN YOU FORGET
AND SET HIS PLACE
AT THE TABLE.
THE FOOD ROTS
BECAUSE YOU FORGOT
HOW TO SHOP FOR ONE.
YOU HAD IT EASY!
DO I DESERVE THIS?
YOU HAVE YOUR FRIENDS
AND RELATIVES!
I HAD ME.
MY FRIENDS SAID,
"AT LEAST YOU HAD A LOVER."
YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND
IN A CLEAN HOSPITAL.
I LOST MINE ON THE STREET.
THEY KILLED HIM
ON THE STREET.
27 YEARS OLD LAYING DEAD.
KILLED BY KIDS
WITH BASEBALL BATS!
THAT'S RIGHT, MA,
KILLED BY CHILDREN.
CHILDREN TAUGHT
BY PEOPLE LIKE YOU.
QUEERS DON'T MATTER!
QUEERS DON'T LOVE!
AND THOSE THAT DO
DESERVE WHAT THEY GET!
Taxi!
ACTION!
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
I'll get it.
[KNOCKING]
You must be Ed.
How do you do?
I'm the mother.
[SLAM]
Nice to have met you.
Whoops.
"WHOOPS"?
Ed, did you say
"WHOOPS"?
No, Ed.
"WHOOPS" IS WHEN YOU FALL
DOWN AN ELEVATOR SHAFT.
"WHOOPS" IS WHEN
YOU SKINNY DIP
IN A SCHOOL OF PIRANHA.
"WHOOPS" IS WHEN YOU
ACCIDENTALLY DOUCHE
WITH DRANO.
No, Ed.
THIS WAS NO "WHOOPS."
This was an "AAAARGH!"
Come on, David.
We're dining out.
Good idea.
Good Luck.
Round Two.
MAMA!
You can come out now.
We got the whole
joint to fight in.
Enjoy yourself.
I'm going to bed.
Ma, sorry I lost
my temper.
I'm glad
you're sorry.
Mama, we've got to
talk about this.
You want to fight.
Did you ever hear
your father and me fight?
No!
Because all my childhood,
I listened to fights.
my father fought
with my mother.
She fought
with my brother.
When I married,
I said,
"I will talk.
I won't fight."
Did you ever hear
us fight? No!
And don't holler.
People say things
they don't mean
When they holler,
and you've said
quite enough.
I won't holler.
We will not discuss
Alan or Daddy.
Only David.
What do you know
from raising a child?
What's to know? Whenever
there's a problem,
I imagine how you
would solve it.
Then I do
the opposite.
You invited me here
to insult me
and spit on
your father's grave?
Ma!
You live the way
you want.
I don't say a word.
But think about
the boy.
He sees you
living like this.
Don't you think it's
bound to affect him?
David is gay.
He's been here
less than a year.
He came that way.
Nobody comes that way!
What an opening.
Everything by you
is a joke.
The world has
gone insane,
and I'm heading
south for summer.
You make it
difficult to have
an intelligent
conversation.
Do what I do.
Talk to yourself.
David was placed here
to develop
a positive attitude
about his homosexuality.
I don't care!
You won't put me
in my grave
like you did
your father.
Now I killed my father!
No! He was thrilled
his son was a fairy!
You think that's why we
brought you into the world?
If I had known,
I wouldn't have bothered!
God should tear out
my tongue
I should talk
to my child like that.
You're a good person
and sensitive
like your father.
And I try to love
you for that
and forget this,
but you won't
let me.
You haven't spoken
once
without saying "gay."
Because it's
what I am.
You could leave it
where it belongs,
but you're
obsessed with it.
Try and imagine
the world
the other way around.
Imagine every book,
every magazine,
every tv show, every movie
was telling you
you should be homosexual.
You know you're not.
Stop! You're
talking crazy.
After all these years,
I'm trying to
justify my life.
This is crazy.
Life?
This is a sickness,
but it's what
you've chosen.
Look, I'm gay.
I don't know why.
Since I can remember,
before I knew it
was different or wrong...
You haven't heard
a word I've said.
You'd rather
I was straight.
Should I lie?
Ed would never
tell his parents.
Instead, he cut them
out of his life!
Is that what
you want?
No, but it doesn't have
to be every conversation.
I'm not editing out
things you don't like.
Can we end
this conversation?
NO!
GOD...
I have taught myself
to sew, cook, fix plumbing.
I can even pat myself
on the back when necessary
So I don't have to ask
anyone for anything.
There's nothing I need
from anyone
Except for love and respect.
Anyone who can't give me
those two things
Has no place
in my life.
You're my mother.
I Love You.
I do, but...
If you can't
respect me,
You've got no business
being here.
You're throwing me out?
Ma, I'm trying to--
Throwing me out.
Isn't that nice?
Listen, mister.
You get one mother
in this world. Only one.
Wait. You just wait.
Yeah. Hello.
Ed, it's Murray.
Is Arnold there?
Well, isn't he at work?
He left after
the first show.
Where would he go?
Where you goin',
boys?
I just got here.
Hello, boys!
Line forms
to the left.
Arnold, come on.
WHAT?
SAY GOOD NIGHT.
OH, YOU.
I HAD YOU.
I don't want
to go home.
She's there.
Spring And Thomson.
Your mother said
she's leaving.
[PHFFFT!]
She didn't want
to stay the night,
but she couldn't
get a flight out
till morning.
She'd stay if
you asked her.
Why did
you get drunk?
Hello? Anybody home?
Sometimes you really
frighten me, Ed.
You care talk
about it, huh?
I am upset.
I am uptight.
I am up to my nipples
in southern comfort,
And you're trying
to take ntage of me.
Fine.
I want another chance
with you.
Arnold, please listen!
I'm 40 years old.
You know what that
means, Arnold?
It's time for me
to stop jerking around.
The time I've spent
with you and David,
It's been the clost thing
to whatever it is I want.
Are you listening to me?
$2.25
Thanks.
I know you're upset
about your mother.
That's not it.
Maybe it's too soon
after Alan.
Leave me alone.
Then what?
Ed, are you
forgetting
why we broke up
in the first place?
You really think
that you could bring
your friends here?
Could you introduce
me to your parents
as your lover
and David
as our son?
Ed...
Angel, I just threw
my mother,
my mother,
out of the house.
All she wanted was
not talk about it.
You really think
I'm going to ask
less from you?
WE'VE GOT
A DEDICATION NOW
FROM BEULAH TO MICHAEL.
THINKING OF YOU.
I ever tell you
about the time
that Alan called in
one of these shows?
You told me.
And how they read
the dedication wrong?
You told me.
Oh, it was
so romantic.
You told me.
Come on, champ.
Breakfast's on me.
Do we ever get
to have a real meal?
Oh, let's go.
I've got to do
something first.
Listen, Um...
What we talked
about last night.
I think it's time
to find out.
I Love You, Arnold.
Ahem, Um...
David are you coming?
In a minute!
A pleasure
meeting you,
Mrs. Beckoff.
I hope you
and your wife
come to your senses.
Couples must
live with conflict.
A problem is never
as permanent
as a solution.
Thank You.
David!
Well, young man,
it's been
an experience.
Same here.
Sorry I scared you
yesterday.
Maybe someday I can
do the same for you.
I'll be leaving
myself now.
You don't
have to go.
You can stay.
With your brother?
It's better
he doesn't know.
I'll call him
from Miami,
tell him
I couldn't make it.
I'll tell him
what happened.
You want to turn him
against me, too?
You want me to leave?
I'm leaving.
You want me to change?
I'm too old.
Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to,
And I hope
you're satisfied.
Oh!
If I had ever
talked to my mother
the way you did to me,
I'd have a wedgie
in my forehead,
but I didn't raise
my children like that.
I wanted them
to respect me
because they wanted to.
Are we starting
this again?
Yes! Because
it's not fair
to put all
the blame on me.
I knew about you,
Arnold
But I said "no."
I hoped.
I knew,
and I turned my back.
I wasn't the only one.
You turned
your back on me, too.
How could
I know about Alan?
Suddenly you would
have understood?
You never
trusted me enough
to tell me.
So you could have
said what?
"Ah, he's
better off dead."
I could have
comforted you.
You cheated me
out of your life
and then blamed me
for not being there.
About this Ed...
You love him?
I don't know.
Yeah, I think so.
Like you loved Alan?
No.
They're very different.
Anyway, it's easier to
love someone who's dead.
They make
so few mistakes.
You've got
an unusual way
of looking at things,
Arnold Beckoff.
I think it runs
in the family.
Ma...
I miss him.
Give yourself
time, Arnold.
It gets better,
but, Arnold,
it never goes away.
You can work
longer hours,
adopt a son,
fight with me,
whatever...
It'll still be there.
It becomes
a part of you,
like learning to wear
a ring or eyeglasses.
You get used to it,
and that's good.
It's good because it makes
sure you don't forget.
You don't want
to forget him, do you?
No.
So...
It's good.
[TELEPHONE RINGS]
You'd better get that.
It might be something
about that
son of yours.
[RING]
Hello.
Oh, hi, Dav--What?
All right.
Yes, I'm turning.
All right.
I'm turning.
It's David.
Something about the radio.
"Turn it on."
MY PRODUCER TOOK THE CALL,
AND HE HAS CONFIRMED IT.
SO FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,
HERE IT IS.
A DEDICATION
FROM David TO Arnold
WITH ALL HIS LOVE.
SOMEWHERE, SOMEDAY?
You hear that, ma?
Stupid kid.
Oh, God, Mama,
He's such a special--
WE'RE CLOSE TOGETHER?
Ma! Ma, You're
not even listening.
OH, BY THE WAY?
THIS TIME,
THE DREAM'S...?
MA.
ON ME?
YOU TAKE MY HAND?
MAMA!
AND YOU LOOK AT ME
ADORINGLY?
BUT AS THINGS STAND?
THIS TIME,
THE DREAM'S ON ME?
IT WOULD BE FUN?
TO BE CERTAIN
THAT I'M THE ONE?
TO KNOW
THAT I AT LEAST?
SUPPLY THE SHOULDER
YOU CRY UPON?
TO SEE YOU THROUGH?
TILL YOU'RE EVERYTHING?
YOU WANNA BE?
IT CAN'T BE TRUE?
BUT THIS TIME?
THE DREAM'S ON ME?*
