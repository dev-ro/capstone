You're slipping away from me!
You're slipping away from me!
They'll park here. We'll be 'round here.
We'll hit these muthafuckers hard.
Chug, you'll be here.
Bobby? You keep your boys out here.
And you, Nig Heke, you stay
back here by the fence.
Catch them on the way out.
Nig! What's up?
Grunt, he stuck me at the back
like I'm a fucking chump!
Watch yourself.
Loverboy!
Are you coming or what?
Come on, leave it. Don't worry about it.
All they're doing is looking at us.
You're too old for that shit.
You got a problem with your eyes?
I told you, you had a problem
With your eyes, bud?
Here, have a seat.
Mikie!
Who's going to give me a beer. Come on.
Sure. Come on, sing along.
Doesn't matter. Where were we?
What?
What am I doing here?
You know I've got the goods.
- See how staunch you are.
- Fuck you. I've always been staunch.
Keep out of sight.
Driver, how good's my credit?
Good as the time I need to ring the cops.
I'm just trying to be friendly here.
- What do I owe you?
- Nine dollars and eight-five cents.
Nine eight-five.
Here's a tenner, you keep the change.
Buy some curry. And don't fucking crash.
Rita, it's me.
- Jake, what you doing here?
- I've come to see my sweet lady.
I was just going to bed.
That's the best idea I've heard all night.
The door, Jake, the door.
You smell nice.
What are you doing?
I'm cooking your breakfast.
It looks like you're cooking
your breakfast.
Anyway, you'll get fat eating that stuff.
You find a bit, you can have it.
You go and get ready for work, go on.
If that's some Romeo, you tell him
Jake the Muss is here.
Just hold that thought.
Jake the snake!
It's your scruffy mate.
I think you better talk to him.
What the fuck is he doing here?
What's the story? I'm trying to feed here.
It's the cops, they've been around home.
- Did you tell them to piss off?
- It's one of your boys.
Which one, what's he done?
It's Nig, he's dead.
- What happened?
- Gang fight, got shot.
Take my car, do whatever you have to.
I ain't going to no funeral.
The mother Will be doing it all,
some as when Gracie died.
All that Maori bullshit!
Don't look at me like that, I'm not going.
Let me do that.
Fucking gangs!
Lord, let not our children stray
and be taken from us.
Keep them strong with love.
Keep them from harm with love.
Go onto the Lord now, child.
Go onto the Lord. Amen.
Cher, brother.
I'm sorry, Beth.
So am I, Jake, so am I.
- I hadn't seen him for so long.
- No, I guess you hadn't.
- But that was always your choice.
- I didn't come here for a lecture.
Why don't you leave her alone?
Sonny, You're grown up.
Are you happy, filling the cemetery
up with Heke kids?
I've got nothing to do with this.
- You had nothing to do with anything.
- Come on, take it easy.
Don't be talking to me like that.
What are you going to do about it,
smack me over?
That's enough.
Thank you for coming.
Thanks for the song.
You be Nig's brother?
Sonny, this is my mate Mookie.
You be Tania?
You want to ride somewhere?
You want a hand?
- What the hell's that?
- His missus.
Where's your missus?
She's still in the bush.
- No jack there?
- No, nothing.
- It's a little car for a big fella.
- I'll say.
How long do you want us to stand here for?
Want a beer?
How long were you with him?
About a year.
I saw him a couple of weeks ago,
he was thinking about buying a car.
Remember the old V8 he had?
He could cut some dirt up in that thing.
Pity he Wrote it off.
That was me.
Went out to see some of my mates.
Had to Walk miles back into town.
Never even got mad.
So that was Jake the Muss.
That was him, Jake the arse hole.
You sound like Nig.
- So where now, for you?
- We were staying at Gang HQ.
We'll take you there then.
Not going near those bastards.
- It was them killed Nig.
- His own gang?
It was his boss, that dude
Who put the patch on the coffin.
Grunt!
You believe what you like,
'cause it's true.
How was it?
Just how I thought it would be. They suck.
You drunk all my beer again!
I didn't, I only had one.
Fucking bullshit!
The fridge was full before I left.
Dole day tomorrow, I'll fix you up.
Heard it before, go on, piss off.
Sure. Sorry bro, about, you know.
You okay?
You still don't believe me, do you?
- Do you?
- Don't want to believe you.
Any of his bros doing anything?
All that bullshit with the patch going
on the coffin? That's all it was!
They're doing nothing!
Nobody cares.
I do.
Come in.
Door's open.
Are you okay?
- Beautiful!
- You don't look it.
- See any tears, am I crying?
- He was your son.
You wouldn't have known that
if you'd been there, they ignored me.
Sonny accuses me of killing Nig and Grace.
What the hell did I do?
I'm still here, I ain't gone to China.
You've got to come to terms with things.
Terms, what the fuck is terms?
All I know is that I get blamed
for something I didn't even do.
How the hell could I, anyway?
Haven't even seen my kids in years.
- What the hell's that look for?
- I don't know, maybe isn't the time.
You started it, let's finish this!
You're the one who said
you haven't seen them in a While.
- Your kids are your responsibility.
- They all went with their mother!
Have any of them come round to see me?
The hell they have.
She's the one that let Nig join the gang.
I would have kicked his fucking arse!
Here's the key, thanks for the car!
There she is, living in a flash house
With Mr Welfare officer.
- Maybe I should come back later.
- You start an argument and then you go?
Bloody women!
Curse of my life!
Are you coming in?
What's up?
Come on, come inside.
What's happening?
Those bastards!
Come here, come on.
He thought everything was going
to be all right...
I know.
..once he joined, once he got patched.
What about you,
are you still living in the same place?
What is it?
How long since you seen the old man?
Not since we split.
- Why?
- I don't know.
Seeing him there,
all that shit he dumped on us.
He was a better father
than he was a husband.
- At least he didn't hit you kids.
- He hit you was the same.
It's over.
It's history.
Why did you stay with him?
Because I loved him.
Where you coming from?
- You want to see him?
- I want to smash his face in.
What do you want?
- Hello to you too.
- You calmed down yet?
Why would I? That was my brother.
You're Jumbo's boy, Mookie?
Hi, Jake.
- How's the old man?
- Not too bad.
Come inside.
We'll stay out here then.
Why are you here?
Something to tell you.
If it's any more of that shit about me
forget it.
What if I said he'd been set up?
By who?
His own gang!
His own gang, another gang,
What's the difference?
Anybody who join a gang
deserves what they get.
I thought you were a fighter,
Jake the Muss.
What do you want me to do?
Take on the whole gang, get myself killed?
- Another Heke in the cemetery?
- The only one should be there.
- Fucking Watch it.
- And you Watch it.
- You just let him die for nothing!
- He died for nothing anyway!
You live with shit
you get treated like shit!
Just like being a Heke.
Come back here.
- I'm wasting my time, come on Mookie.
- Come back!
Fuck off, then!
Go and se a doctor.
What's going on?
Don't want you anymore, you're barred!
What for?
That scrap the other night?
It was only a fight.
I'm sick of your bullshit,
sick of you Wrecking the place.
You're not welcome, not ever, you're gone.
The way it is.
Fuck you. And fuck you too Mc Clutchy!
I'll take my money somewhere else.
Fuck your stupid pub!
Need an army to get in there.
So we get one.
Not those bastards.
My cousin joined the army, he's a Wanker.
You want to beat an army, you get an army.
- Where are we going to get an army from?
- We'll get another gang.
The Snakes, the ones they were
fighting the other night.
The Snakes!
You two are crazy, how we going to do that?
I got a few ideas.
20 dollars.
A jug.
Sorry, Sir, we don't serve jugs.
What have you got?
Handles, halves, cans or stubbies.
Make it a handle.
Actually, make that two.
27 in the meat raffle.
That's me!
The fella with no jack.
Fella with the pig.
What's the name anyway?
- Jake Heke.
- G'day, Jake. Kohi.
Come and meet my little brother.
Thanks for the other day.
Jake, Gary.
I don't think I've seen you in here before.
I just thought I'd give it a try.
- Where do you usually drink?
- Mc Clutchy.
- That dump?
- What?
That's a dump.
You're right, it is a dump.
You like horses?
- It's just that they don't like me.
- Same here, mate.
Where you working?
Here and there.
Are you like for work?
Might have something for you.
- Who said I was looking?
- I'm just saying.
If you're keen head down to the
site office. New motorway heading north.
That's my coin, my game.
What's it for? A side bet?
To take my turn at the table,
don't get fucking smart.
If you want a game
put your name on the blackboard.
- Fuck the board. There's my coin.
- Come on, take it easy.
- Jake, take it easy.
- They jumped the queue.
- It's only a game, what's the problem?
- I don't have to put up that shit.
People just come here for a drink,
not this.
Where out of here.
Where are you going?
Play your game.
I know you're in there. Open the door.
Not tonight, please.
I told you, you we're in there.
Open the door.
- I've got to go to work in the morning.
- You're always working.
- Give me a kiss. What's up?
- You're drunk, go home.
- You're sexy.
- Go home please.
I'll sleep on the couch.
Don't worry about me.
Just one drink.
You've had enough, I can smell it.
What are you saying, I'm stink?
That's what I'm saying. Go home!
- Don't say it, say sorry.
- Come on, don't do this.
I just want to be treated with respect.
What I see I don't respect.
Now go home!
That's all you are, is Jake the Muss.
Hang on, I didn't mean it.
Why do you think they hate you?
You gutless bastard!
Get out! Go on, get out!
I hope we know what we're doing.
These fuckers look worse than the other.
It's who dares.
- There better be a good reason.
- We want to talk to Apeman.
Wait!
Social call for a Black HaWk?
Ain't a HaWk no more.
Now Why would that be?
What's in the bag?
- It ain't a bomb, is it?
- We want to talk business.
Shut up.
Hoping it's a deal.
Put it up here.
So, what do you want?
That thing the other night. With the HaWks?
That was my brother who got shot.
It was us he was fighting,
so what are you doing here?
He was set up by Grunt.
- I told you to shut up.
- It's true.
So, what?
You want us to hit Grunt?
What about you?
What do you want?
Where's the beers?
You think we're contractors?
- Work for anybody?
- We want to join.
Join?
Do we?
You think money joins you?
Suffering joins you!
I'm suffering, my brother's dead!
So now you've joined.
The beer's over there.
Hang on, what about the deal?
This?
This is just a joining fee.
You do the hit and we'll do the same again.
SWeet.
You never said anything about joining.
Whatever it takes, Mook.
With all the money we gave that arsehole
We could have flown a Mafia hitman in
and still got the change.
Now we've got to do another rammy.
Mulla, my man.
Brother!
Welcome home, you been away too long.
Get the man a drink.
No, give the man a bottle.
For you, bro.
And this!
You took the rap.
You home now!
Snake!
SWeet.
- Come for a dance.
- She's cool.
What's the matter?
Jesus.
You think I've forgotten or something?
Come on, you can't grieve all the time.
- You go, go on!
- Come on.
No, you go.
I don't care.
Fuck you then.
We going home sometime soon?
I want to be around
When things start happening.
- I didn't hear him say he was going to.
- He'll do it.
Give him time.
He likes the money.
Where's the smokes?
What was that shit last night
With ''boy-got the business''.
See that, did you?
No, you didn't.
What are you crying?
He's in a grumpy mood.
What's the matter, no breakfast?
Think I don't know?
Go on, take it.
Buy something to eat.
Don't go buying no smokes with it.
Fucking people don't feed their kids.
Leave me alone, Ape. I just lost my man.
What the dead don't know,
the dead don't grieve.
You know the rules.
Got to earn your keep, sister.
Door down the hall.
- What's happening?
- You see that?
How quick was she?
- What's she doing?
- She ain't arranging the flowers.
I was just looking for someone.
Bald guy with tattoos.
That's half of them.
He was giving my kids some money.
I just want to see him.
Go and get Mulla.
I suppose you don't want to come in.
- Don't think so.
- Smart move.
- What's he like?
- I don't know, a bro's a bro.
Don't I know it.
Can I have a word with you?
What have I done? I'm innocent,
I only just got out.
- I want my lawyer.
- It's about my kids.
You gave them some money.
- Said you didn't give them no breakfast.
- How it is when you're on a benefit?
- You don't eat, you die.
- Don't you think I don't know?
Whole place's full of people can't
feed their kid. Where you been?
You got enough for your smokes.
I don't smoke I die.
Anyway, thanks again, see you.
What did you say your name was?
I didn't, but it's Gloria.
You feel like a party anytime, Gloria
I'll get some McDonalds for the kids.
Whatever.
- Doesn't piss around, does he?
- Just drop it.
What am I supposed to do, say no?
Let him smack me around?
You can always stay round the flat.
You think they don't know where you live?
He claimed me, got that?
Bloody men. You bastards think you're
the only ones who suffer.
- Fuck you!
- Tarns!
Don't call me that.
- What are you looking at me like that for?
- I don't know.
Sorry, I guess.
Just didn't think, you know?
- I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- That's cool.
An about calling me that, Tarns.
- That's what Nig used to call me.
- Cher.
You ever done anything...
..right before in your life?
Not much.
When I was a kid,
I used to go into the record stores
and sing along with the music.
- I used to come out feeling aWesome.
- Must have been choice.
A bit like Karaoke.
Better than that.
I felt like it was me on the record.
Good place.
Just like home.
And just us knows it.
SWeet.
- Go away.
- I just want to talk to you.
- I've nothing to say.
- I just want to talk.
Don't touch me.
You don't have to do anything, just listen.
All right.
I've never really used
to think about it before.
I just thought it was normal.
When I was growing up that's all I saw.
The old man hitting the old lady,
uncles hitting aunties. They hit us.
Sometimes, everyone was hitting everyone.
And I'm sorry.
I said it. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
But I shouldn't have to suffer
the consequences, nobody should.
I know that...
..and that's what I'm trying to say
and I don't want to do that shit.
I just get so mad.
A man can't Win, can he?
That's up to you.
But I'm not going to live with it.
I heard you.
Fuck it! Shit!
Take them off.
Glasses.
Now, look at me.
Take it off.
What?
Are you in the Wars again?
- A bit of an accident.
- How's the job going?
I love it. When do I get
to drive one of those?
Everyone starts at the bottom around here.
Get out!
Come on.
Didn't we get it right?
- Your man in?
- What do you want?
I'm not here to cause any trouble,
I just want Sonny's address.
Why?
I just want to see him.
I'd have to ask him first.
He came to see me and...
Just give me his address and I'll go.
Please.
That's the first time
you've ever said that word to me.
I should have said a lot of things.
I do want to see him.
Wait here.
You sang at the funeral.
I supposed I should have said thank you.
But you didn't.
- I'm Jake.
- I know who you are.
What do you want?
I came to see Sonny.
Thanks for the cup of tea.
- You know what you're doing?
- Sure.
- That's the carby.
- I know that. I've fixed cars before.
- It's the fuel pump that needs fixing.
- Says you. Here's the fuel pump.
- How'd you know where I live?
- Take it easy. I just came for a talk.
Nothing to talk about.
Give him a break.
Are you doing this thing or not?
What's this?
What does it look like?
So you're into gangs too.
Why, do you want to end up
like Nig or what?
No, but I don't want to end up
like you either.
- What are you saying, it's my fault?
- Whatever.
I came around to see you.
Maybe we could have a beer.
Get pissed of by yourself.
Can't you just let it go for once?
- I see.
- You don't see anything.
Why don't you piss off, Jake.
You know where I live.
We know.
We just don't care.
- What do you two want?
- I want to talk about our deal.
- What deal was that?
- Come on, we paid.
Had no deal to go to War with HaWks.
- I thought you were going to do the hit.
- You thought it was going to be sweet.
You two dumb punks.
You think we just go around
shooting each other on sight.
It doesn't work like that.
What about our money?
What about it? You feed the brothers.
- You a Snake.
- What about Grunt?
Fuck him.
What did you expect, interest?
I thought we we're supposed to be
all in it together.
Gangs, brother ain't what
they're cracked up to be.
- want a smoke?
- No, man.
I need some air.
We fucked up!
We fucked up big time!
You're right, we fucked up.
We've just been wasting our time!
He wasn't going to do it.
Come here.
It's all right.
I ain't giving up.
I do that, it's saying Nig was nothing.
He was never nothing to me.
- Coming for a beer?
- Your shout?
I'll loan you till payday.
- Do you go hunting?
- Hunt what?
We hunt pigs and stalk deer.
No, I haven't tried it.
I supposed you don't
even play rugby either.
You kick a ball around
and hunt a pig at the same time?
- That's funny.
- I didn't see you laugh.
You've been saving that one up.
Seven years.
You were almost worth the wait.
Is that what those dots stand for?
- Seven years?
- No, they're borstal.
Did my first lag when I was thirteen.
Ain't hardly been out since.
- Tough guy.
- Tough enough to handle you.
Not scared from you.
We just been making love.
That what we did?
Sure.
Say that again.
We made love.
Don't you get sick of that life?
Why?
Like going in and out of gaol all the time.
Going to keep my head down.
So how are you going to live?
I've got a few things going.
- What kind of things?
- Just things.
Get you taste of the good life.
Me and you.
If you want.
Why did we have to go through all that
to get here?
- It's the way it is.
- You don't feel bad?
Don't talk up a storm.
It was good.
It was.
Are we still going to do this thing?
It's going to have to be just you and me.
We've still got Mook.
We've still got Mook.
Be like trying to hit Apeman.
Always got his boys around.
Not always.
I know some things.
I can show you if you like.
Put that on.
Go find him, Spike.
What about one of those?
- Here's yours here.
- What do I do with this?
You stick it.
- Stick what?
- In the throat. Wiggle it to the heart.
We got to catch him first.
Just show me the pig.
I'll stick in a headlock
and choke it to death.
Get some While you can.
Best you ever tasted.
That's Why we have taps.
There!
What?
Dogs!
What fucking dogs?
It's a big bastard.
- You've got the knife, go stick him.
- I'm not going down there.
You've got the gun, shoot the bloody thing.
Leave it! Leave it!
Get out of there, leave it to the dogs.
Come here, you bastard!
Look at you.
Should see the look on your face.
What the hell did you do that for?
I was ready for it.
This pig was ready for you.
You were shitting yourself.
It's done now.
No way, got to get that thing
back to the jeep, now.
That's me, chuck it on.
That's her.
Grunt's bit of White meat.
Thinks she's a secret, but us girIs knew.
None of his bros did, but us.
They all think we're stupid.
He goes to her at night.
On his own.
Cher.
Give it to me.
Give it to Khoi.
No way.
What's Wrong?
Got some muscles you didn't know you had?
That's for sure.
Thought that pig was going
to clean you up today.
So did I.
You did okay.
Not bad, I reckon.
Can I ask you something?
What do you do when your son joins a gang?
Kick his arse.
Bring him up so he doesn't want to.
Sometimes it doesn't work out like that.
You hear about the guy who got shot?
My son.
I had a missus kick me out,
a daughter kill herself.
Now another son in a gang.
There's a bit of bad luck there.
Bad something.
You got kids?
Three hunters.
Four girIs.
Mind you, mine have left home now.
At least they know where home is.
I just want to do something right.
Just once.
Are you singing or what?
Your man?
He's a mean fucker.
He gives the orders from behind.
We'll see how well he takes one.
Like the one he took from your old man.
What has my old man got to do with Grunt?
Jake wasted him years ago,
people still talk about it.
You ought to know about that one.
Where you been?
Why do you think he blew Nig away?
It was always Jakey.
- You be at flat tonight, you hear.
- What's going on?
Just be there!
Are you going out?
I'm having a party around home tonight.
Some of my fellow workers are coming
With their Wives and girIfriends.
And I just thought you might want...
..try again?
I said what I wanted to say.
Maybe give me a call.
I Will.
- You have a good night.
- You too.
Mook, where are you?
More beer.
- Are you okay?
- He was drunk.
- Where's Mook?
- Didn't come.
Got them?
We're still going to do this thing?
- I hate this.
- What?
Waiting like this in the dark.
It reminds me when I was a kid.
Waiting for the old lady.
- Where was the old man?
- Never knew him.
Probably a good thing.
I don't know.
4 kids, 4 different fathers.
Never saw any of them.
You're family.
Once she was gone for 3 nights in a row.
We got no money, no food.
Not even one Wheetbix in the whole house.
Then Rob, he was 6,
finds this 5 buck note down the back
of the couch, how it gets down there?
So we live again.
I say:
''Sis's going to the shops and buy
some fish and chips. I'll be back soon''.
I wasn't gone for long.
You know how it takes a kid
half a hour to get anyWhere?
When I get back,
the whole house was...
The whole place was up in flames.
There was all these people standing around,
fire engines everyWhere.
Somebody goes to get mum.
And when she comes back, she bashes me.
Like it was my fault.
It wasn't my fault.
I was just a kid.
We was all starving.
That's him.
The fucking bastard.
Bloody murderer!
Just hang on, put that thing down.
- Tarns, what the hell's going on?
- Don't call me Tarns.
What's this shit?
Put it down, I don't even know you.
I'm Nig Heke brother.
You got it Wrong, just put it down.
Shoot him!
- You got it Wrong.
- You killed my brother!
Shoot him!
You fucking little punk.
You bastard!
It wouldn't work!
Slow down!
- We've got to get these things back.
- No way!
You call yourselves pig hunter!
I'm going to bed, don't Wake me.
What are we doing here? We got to get away.
- I can't.
- Why? We stay here and we're dead.
I got to tell Mook,
they're going to think he was in it.
No, we ain't got time.
You stay here!
Here's a safe place, I won't be long.
Because I smacked him? That was years ago.
That's what he said.
- He has done this thing?
- I don't know.
What's going on?
I couldn't borrow the jeep, could I?
- Are you all right?
- I've just got some shit to sort out.
Stay here, get inside.
You want a hand?
No, it's my problem.
Ape!
- Wake up!
- Fuck off.
Call man, it's the HaWkes,
I think you better take.
Talk.
- What's happening?
- Some bastard's shot Grunt!
I want that bitch
and her two dickhead mates.
I want her back now!
Get them, move it!
And I want everybody here.
We've got a War on our hands.
There's something you should know.
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- I'm looking for you.
Did you do this thing?
Nobody else was going to.
- You're going to spend your life in gaol!
- What do you care?
I'm here, aren't I?
It was you who started the whole thing.
Calm down!
- It's what you did to Grunt.
- Don't go there.
- You bastard!
- Calm down!
You killed him!
It's what you did to Grunt that killed Nig.
Cut it out!
We got to stop fighting each other.
I'm sorry.
Easy, boy.
Are you okay?
Just tell me, did you finish him?
I don't know, I think so.
What are you going to do?
- Help me here.
- I don't know.
We didn't think.
We? The girI's in on it?
Where is she?
At a place, I'll show you.
Was that them?
I suppose you've got
both gangs looking for you?
And the cops.
- Are you sure you didn't miss anyone?
- Don't think so.
Where's Sonny?
That all you care about?
Don't you know what's going to happen?
I got a pretty good idea.
It wasn't him who hit Grunt.
It was me.
- You didn't learn the rules.
- Mine I did.
And you can't hurt me.
Why?
We could have been together,
you had my protection.
What's that supposed to be? A life?
Fuck you!
Look at me!
I wouldn't want your face to be
the last thing I see.
Look at me!
Go get her.
Jesus.
You bastard!
Shut up!
Go around to the HaWkes, all of you!
Some guys at Stanton Street.
Go round the back.
They want War? We'll give them a War!
Move it!
Bring me that piece of shit.
Where's your mate, Mr. ''Where's the beers''?
- You didn't have to kill her!
- Wrong answer.
Do you think you're going to make me
look like a prick?
We'll find him.
Do you know what's going to happen?
We're going to cut your heads off,
the both of you.
And then we're going to toss them over
the HaWkes Wall as a little prezzie.
Where are you going?
Look at him, dressed like a Snake.
He's not even a Snake's arsehole.
What are you doing here?
Get up, come over here.
You must be crazy Walking in here.
You know we could waste you just like that.
I ain't here to fight.
I'm here for the boy.
Get up.
Come over here.
Out of the way!
What the fuck is this shit?
We've got no fight with you.
I just want my boy.
It's a bit late.
I'll hit the both of you.
Gangs, brother.
That's enough, stop it!
He killed her!
I know. We're going to get out of here.
Where?
AnyWhere but out of here.
Are you okay?
Come on, I've got you.
A little more.
I'm not going to loose you.
I'm not going to loose you.
I've had enough.
Let's go home.
