Hey.
Uh, hey, Jessica.
Uh, can you send me the Jackson file?
Doesn't seem to be in my e-mails.
I just need to look at it this evening.
Okay, good. Thanks. See you tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
We need to talk.
You can't just show up here
with no warning.
I tried you, I don't know how many times.
But you don't pick up your phone.
What's the problem?
- It's Nicholas.
- Has something happened?
Well, tell me.
This afternoon, they called me in.
The school. Just now.
To speak to the principal.
So he could explain to me
what was going on.
And that's when I found out.
Nicholas hasn't been to school
in almost a month.
What?
I am telling you...
For weeks now he's just been pretending.
- Every morning...
- What are you talking about?
- I'm explaining it to you.
- Back up a minute.
He hasn't been to school in almost a month
and you never noticed anything?
He was heading out with his bag
and everything he needed for the day,
like nothing was wrong.
Except he just wasn't going there.
- And the school, they just...
- They...
They said they sent me a bunch of e-mails,
which I never got.
What was he doing?
I mean, all day. Where did he go?
I don't know. I have no idea.
And he barely answers
my questions anymore.
Uh... Beth, urn...
Sorry, Kate's just here
to talk to me about, um, Nicholas.
We've just found out he hasn't been going
to school for almost a month.
It's not only that, Peter.
He's not well.
You need to speak to him.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He needs you, Peter.
You can't just abandon him.
I'm not abandoning him.
Why do you keep saying these things?
Okay.
Look, the other day, I...
I asked him to...
I don't even remember what,
take his plate out or something, and...
He just looked at me, um...
With, uh...
With so much hatred.
I thought he was gonna...
What?
He scares me, okay.
All right, I'll, uh...
I'll go see him tomorrow.
I'll swing by at the end of the day.
Thanks.
We've looked
into their sustainability policies
and we think that acquiring this company
will be in line with our green strategy.
They have great environmental,
social and governance factors
that will give us great kudos.
And we think a merger with them will be
good for their reputation as well as ours.
Great. I think I have all the information
I need for now.
I'll call Jeffrey,
see if we can get them to move.
- Perfect.
- Great.
Thank you.
Please.
I'll get back to you
as soon as this one's done, all right?
- Thank you.
- Great.
Thanks.
Doors closing.
Thanks.
Come on, boy.
Hey.
What are you doing here?
Is it all right? Am I disturbing you?
How are you?
Okay.
Look, I came by because I wanted to...
I wanted to talk to you.
Do you have a couple of minutes?
Sure.
Your mom told me
you haven't been going to school.
What's going on?
Nothing.
Listen, I know you're having a hard time
at the moment and you're mad at me,
but that's not a reason
for us not to talk to each other.
Why have you stopped going to school?
I don't know.
You don't know?
You can't decide
to suddenly stop going to school.
It's not an option.
Are you having problems?
Why are you sighing?
No reason.
There must be a reason. Tell me.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Nicholas, I can't help you
if you won't tell me anything.
What were you doing all those days?
Where did you go?
I walked.
You walked? On your own?
But why, Nicholas?
You think that's acceptable?
And with your sats coming up as well.
You realize the school
is talking about expelling you?
Hey.
Your mother's at the end of her rope,
you know that?
She wants to send you to boarding school.
- Is that what you want?
- No.
So you have to do something.
You can't just let things go like this.
I can't deal with any of it.
What makes you say that?
Has something happened at school?
Or outside of school?
We can talk to one another,
you know. Just...
It's not that.
It's...
Yes?
I don't know how to describe it.
Just tell me in your own words.
It's life.
It's weighing me down.
What is it that isn't working for you?
I don't know.
I want something to change,
but I don't know what.
And that's why sometimes
I tell myself that maybe...
Tell me.
I'd like to live with you.
- With me?
- Me and mom...
We're not getting along.
She can't put up with me anymore.
I know she can't.
And when I'm here...
I get too many dark ideas.
And I wanna live with my little brother.
Yeah, um...
If you send me to boarding school,
I'll go crazy.
- Of course you won't.
- Yes, I will, I'm telling you.
I feel like my head's exploding.
Come here.
Sometimes I just feel
as if I'm going crazy, dad.
What are you talking about?
I'm telling you.
I don't know what's happening to me.
Come on. Don't worry, sweetheart.
We'll work it out.
Trust me.
Hey, you've reached Kate. Leave a message.
Hi, it's me.
Um, I've just spoken to him. Um...
Can you call me back
when you get this message? Thanks.
Why are you taking it like this?
Taking it like what?
He can stay in the room in the back.
And what about school?
We'll figure something out.
There must be a school that will
take him mid-semester, don't you think?
Yeah, I'm sure. Sure there is.
You've only known him for two years.
And I can see that...
I know you have
a negative impression of him,
after everything that happened,
but he hasn't always been like that.
When he was younger, he was so...
When I went to see him just now he had...
I don't know, marks.
Marks? As in, like...?
Scars, on his arm.
It upset me so much, it just...
He's my little boy.
Hey.
You know, it's true, you're right.
I feel guilty.
I can't pretend
I'm not responsible for the situation.
I left, Beth.
- I left.
- But it's not your fault if he's not well.
He's going through a difficult time.
Anyway, I don't think I have a choice.
I can't just give up on him.
Okay, I understand.
Don't worry. I get it.
And you should talk to a doctor
about the scars.
I know.
Hey, so, you're ready?
- Oh. Wouldn't you...?
- No, thanks.
- So...
- Yes.
And don't forget, I mean,
you know, you can always...
I know. Thanks, morn.
Any time, because...
But don't think it's because...
I know.
I know what you mean. Don't worry.
All right.
Hey, uh...
Call me.
Oh, wait.
- I almost forgot.
- What?
Banana bread.
Thanks, morn.
Love you.
Hey, got everything you need?
Yeah, I do.
Found the towel Beth left out for you?
All right, good.
Okay, I'll leave you alone.
I'm heading to bed.
I'm so happy you're here.
I've missed spending time with you.
How about Beth?
Is she really okay with me moving in here?
Obviously, Nicholas.
We're very pleased to have you,
both of us.
This is your home as well, you know.
Okay?
Come on, you should get to bed. It's late.
Hey.
Good night.
Night, dad.
Dr. Col/ins, it's Peter Miller.
Sorry to call you on your cell, but, uh...
I wanted to talk to you
about my son, Nicholas.
I think he needs to see a therapist.
And I thought
you might know somebody good. So...
If you could call me back. Thanks.
Am I disturbing you?
No, no, no. Come in.
Tell me...
Am I right
you're thinking of going to DC. Soon?
News travels fast.
They say he's running in the primaries.
Is that true?
What exactly is he offering you?
To be part of the campaign team?
He hasn't said anything specific, but...
All right, I'll let you do your work.
But you'll get back to me
when you know more?
Of course. Of course.
Everything okay at home?
What?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's great.
Thanks, Andrew.
And here we are.
Now, in 1776,
when the declaration of inde...
Hi. I'm just interrupting you for a minute
to introduce Nicholas,
who's joining us here today.
I know you'll all give him a warm welcome.
Hello, Nicholas. I'm Mr. Yama.
I'll be teaching you history.
Welcome.
Find a seat.
And come see me when class is over,
so I can bring you up to date
to where we are right now.
Great. I'll leave you to it.
So, as I was saying,
and this would be good to note down,
the sharing of power between the national
and state governments.
Now, in 1776, when the declaration
of independence was signed,
the newly independent 13 states
acted more like quarreling siblings.
Each of them wanting sovereignty.
Does anyone know what sovereignty is?
Absolute power.
Now, of course, on the world's stage,
this wasn't possible.
Is that the original plan?
- Hey, man. How's it going?
- Fine. And you?
Oh, you know.
You meeting the boss?
- Yeah.
- You're in luck, he's in a good mood.
- Good.
- You still in New York?
Still in New York, yeah.
Hey, how's your dad?
I heard he had a little health problem?
Oh, yeah, well, not really.
Everything's fine. Thanks.
Good. Good.
We just haven't seen him in a long time.
- Say hi to him for me, will you?
- Sure.
- All right. See you.
- See you.
We're ready for you.
This way.
Thank you.
Ah, Peter. How are you?
Good of you to come and see us.
Let me introduce you to two of our people
who are working on our...
Nicholas, hi, it's me.
Just, uh, wanted to know
how it went for you today. Um...
Call me. Love you.
Nicholas, are you ready?
Because it's time to go now.
Nicholas, I made you a coffee.
You've got enough time to drink it, okay?
Nicholas, you're gonna be late.
I must have called you at least 10 times.
We cannot do this every single morning.
Do you hear me?
Nicholas!
- Why don't you answer me?
- I do answer you.
- It's time. You have to go.
- I know.
Theo didn't wake you up last night?
God, you're so lucky.
The same as your dad.
Literally nothing wakes him up.
That expression
"sleeping like a baby" really...
It should be "sleeping like a man."
Where is he?
Oh, he already left.
Had a really early meeting this morning.
Here's your coffee.
You've got about five minutes.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Are you in pain?
It's...
It's not that.
Are you unhappy?
- Why are you unhappy?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Does this happen a lot?
That you just start crying like this
for no reason?
I'm not crying.
- Uh...
- Anyways, I have to go.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah, of course.
When you met my dad,
did you know he was married?
- Ah... um...
- Did you?
But he told me right away that...
That what?
Maybe it's better
if you talk to him about this.
You know...
When he left, my mom took it really hard.
She really suffered.
She never stopped
saying terrible things about him.
And the whole time I still worshiped him.
It was like I was being...
Chopped in half.
I understand.
It's just not an easy situation.
And it didn't stop you?
Sorry?
When you met him.
The fact you knew he was married
and had a son, it didn't stop you?
What do you want me to say, Nicholas?
Nothing. You're right.
I don't know why I'm asking you.
It's stupid.
- No, it's not stupid.
- Anyways, I have to go. See you later.
I'll see you later.
Hey, Nicholas, it's me.
Just wanted to give you a hug.
I hope everything's all right with you.
I was hoping we could
get together one day, you know...
If you have some time.
Call me back. I miss you.
If we can prove to them that they
should never have made the first move...
It starts to look possible.
It's all about a matter
of the balance of power.
- Yes?
- Excuse me.
Is this what you were looking for?
Ah, excellent.
Did you find this in the archives?
Oh, great job.
Anything else you need?
Thanks very much.
This is going to be very useful.
- Who's that?
- Who?
Uh, the new intern.
He's French. Very smart.
Why?
No reason.
Okay, see you tomorrow.
Hey.
Hey, Peter, it's me.
Um, look, I...
I don't mean to bother you. But...
I haven't heard back from Nicholas at all.
And I just keep leaving him messages,
and he's not calling me back.
Could we talk?
Thanks.
Nice jacket.
Thanks.
Please.
So, everything's going well
at your new school?
It's okay.
You said you don't feel very close
to people your age?
- Why is that?
- I just think they're stupid.
All they care about is having parties
and having fun.
I'm not interested in any of that.
So what are you interested in?
- What?
- No, nothing. It's...
Anyway...
Things are better now.
You don't like being this age?
That's not what I...
Hey there. Um...
- Hi, sir.
- Hi. Oh, there she is.
Thank you.
- Sorry I'm late.
- No. No problem.
I know how busy you are.
Especially right now, I hear.
- Yeah.
- That's exciting.
- Mm.
- Oh.
- What would you like?
- Um, I don't know. How about you?
Sparkling water, please.
- I'll have a Martini.
- Oh.
Um, in that case, two martinis.
Two martinis coming up.
So, how's it going?
Listen, it's going well, um...
He's started his new school.
And, uh, says he likes it.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah. I had to lean on him
a little at the beginning.
But, um, you know,
I think he's feeling better now.
And, honestly, I think he's on his way.
Has he been able to tell you
what happened at the old school?
Mm. No, he doesn't say much.
I don't understand
where this sadness comes from.
He's a teenager, Kate.
I mean, ever seen
a teenager radiating happiness?
It's not just that.
He's different from...
- The others.
- What makes you say that?
If you ask me,
he's been disappointed in love.
It's possible.
He is so romantic.
Guess where he gets that from.
There we are.
Thank you.
Great. Thank you.
Um...
-Cheers.
And what about, uh...
Beth?
Yeah. How's she taking it?
You can talk to me.
Okay.
Well, to start with,
she was a little, um...
- Hostile, I imagine.
- No, not really. Um...
Maybe a little unsettled.
What with the baby
and she was already quite tired.
She hadn't been expecting to be living
with a teenager right off the bat.
I can understand that.
Yeah. But, all in all, it's going well.
He's not making, uh,
things too difficult for her?
No, no. He's behaving himself.
He's making an effort.
Yeah, he likes living
with his little brother.
Great.
Yeah, I think
that side of things is gonna work.
Kate, what's the matter? Hey.
Nothing. Sorry.
I'm sorry if I...
I mean, I didn't mean to upset you.
I know.
I feel like a complete failure.
What are you talking about?
Kate, you're not a failure in any way.
Sorry.
It's just I never imagined
he'd leave home.
Him too.
- And go live with you.
- Listen, me neither.
I mean, he's the one who asked me.
Yes, but the problem started with me.
- Of course it didn't.
- Yes.
He doesn't wanna live with me anymore.
I call, and he doesn't even pick up.
Oh, come on.
You just have to give it some time.
I am so sorry.
It's all right.
Oh...
Oh.
A few days ago I, urn...
I found this photo of him.
It's, uh, from when we took
that trip to corsica, remember?
Yeah.
When I look at that photo...
I'm devastated.
- We, uh...
- -Rented that little boat, remember?
Yes, of course.
That was the summer
you were teaching him to swim.
His face.
It's so open. Like a little sunbeam.
My little sunbeam.
When you think about it...
There was so much joy
in our family back then.
I don't know what happened.
Come on.
I loved him so much.
And you.
I loved you so much, Peter.
If you knew how much I loved you...
Come on, don't be so upset.
You're a wonderful mother.
It's not your fault
if he's going through a rough patch.
It's just...
Soon everything will go back to normal.
Yes, it will. It will. Believe me, Kate.
Everything will be fine.
You think so?
- All right?
- Yeah. Finally.
He's taken his time.
I know. God, I practically fell asleep
myself in there.
- Here.
- Thank you. That's so nice.
You had a good day?
Yeah. I mean, it was nothing special.
Went to the pediatrician.
Mm-hm.
Other than that, we just stayed at home.
What about you?
What?
- What?
- What?
Why are you looking so...
Smug?
What is that?
Is this your way of saying sorry?
It's to thank you.
- For what?
- You know very well.
I mean, they're very pretty.
You know, I'm well aware... I mean...
I'm just really grateful
for how you've handled all this.
That's what I said.
It's your way of saying sorry.
What I mean is, I'm lucky you're here.
Yes, because you're not here much.
You are at work all of the time.
Not all the time.
Dad, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh, yes, of course.
- I'm disturbing you, aren't I?
- Not at all. Tell me.
It's nothing urgent. I just wanted
to ask your advice on something.
It can wait.
Will you come see me...
- Aften/vards?
- Right.
Great. Thanks.
He looks better, don't you think?
He told me he got an "a" today in math.
- Oh, he did?
- Yeah. I'm really pleased.
I think he's starting
to regain his self-confidence.
And he tells me,
he's been invited to a party.
Oh, that's great.
Yeah. Worries me
he's on his own all the time.
- Anyway, it went well.
- What?
- The, uh, pediatrician, with Theo.
- Oh, yeah. What'd she say?
Just the same as you.
"It's a passing phase."
Soon he'll be sleeping through.
Anyway, as long as that phase is going on,
I'm gonna go cook dinner,
before I fall asleep
right here on this couch.
No, it's okay. I'll go. I'll go.
Hey, Theo.
Come here, come here.
Oh, it's okay.
Well?
I don't know.
- It suits you.
- Yeah.
- It's nice of you, but...
- What?
I'm not really sure
people my age wear jackets.
Are you kidding me?
Everyone's wearing them now, right?
- Yeah. He's right.
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah. It really suits you.
It's French.
Look at you.
You should wear that to the party.
When is it? Next Saturday, isn't it?
You know, I'm not even sure if I'm going.
What? You have to go.
Come on, it's important to see people.
I don't know how to dance.
So that's the problem.
What?
We're home.
Hey, Beth.
Shh!
- He's asleep.
- Oh, sorry.
Where have you guys been?
You have to teach him to dance.
She's the best dancer I know.
- Oh, what? That is very funny.
- What?
The way you dance,
you have the nerve to criticize me?
Isn't he a good dancer?
Uh, I just...
I would say he has his own style.
It's my unique style.
- Did you know we met at a wedding?
- Beth.
And that was the first time
I saw your dad.
He was on the dance floor.
Doing his famous hip sway.
His what?
You don't know his famous hip sway?
No.
Beth, better you just teach him to dance.
He's going to a party.
Watch this.
What are you doing?
- Oh, come on.
- Here we are.
Come on.
Oh, no, no.
Oh, come on.
J“ it's not unusual to
be loved by anyone j“
is this really a good idea?
J“ it's not unusual
to have fun with anyone j“
you're not gonna show us?
J“ but when [see you... j“
I'm afraid to wake Theo.
Come on, dad!
J“ it's not unusual... j“
all right.
At your own risk. You asked for it.
J“ I wanna die j“
J“ it's not unusual... j“
It's the face.
J“ but when I see you out and about
it's such a crime j“
j“ if you should ever want
to be loved by anyone... j“
you see why
I instantly fell in love with him?
- Who wouldn't?
- I'm irresistible.
J“ it's not unusual
it happens every day... j“
when he starts,
everyone else stops in the room.
It's like he just can't help
drawing attention to himself.
J“ it happens all the time... j“
how do you do it?
I have no idea. Come on, I'll show you.
No, no, no, Peter.
- No. Nicholas, don't!
- Come on!
Like this. Ready?
Fohll'
oh, god. Wait, no!
Fingers, knee. Fingers, knee.
Yes! That's it.
That's what you need for your party.
That's it.
God, not another one!
Oh, there's two.
J“ it's not unusual to be... j“
look. Hey, you'll knock them dead.
Look at him move. Yeah, that's my son.
Right, I'm coming in.
J“ but if! Ever find
that you've changed at any time j“
j“ it's not unusual to find out
I'm in love with you, whoa, oh... j“
J“ and we lay low before the night j“
J“ 'cause we found shore when we arrived j“
J“ we put up signs so high j“
j“ we lost sight of 'em j“
J“ and we make lies j“
j“ before the night j“
I'mmj'
j“ I'll be watching you move j“
j“ I'll be watching you move
like it's nothing j“
j“ and it'll be everything
like it always was j“
j“ I'll be watching you move
I'll be watching you move j“
It was under his mattress.
Sorry. Thought I'd better tell you.
You think he's still, you know...?
I don't understand it. I mean...
He seems to be doing well, doesn't he?
He's going to school.
He's smiling. He's better.
- Yes.
- So why is he doing this?
Well, the simplest thing
would be to talk to him about it,
don't you think?
Maybe to his therapist.
Okay.
- You going out?
- Yeah. Get some sun.
- Okay.
- Come here, buddy.
Look, don't worry.
He's probably still a bit fragile.
But he knows you're here for him.
I'm sure you're gonna figure it out.
You think so?
Mm-hm.
Where have you been?
Why?
Is there a problem?
Why have you hidden a knife
under your mattress?
What?
There was a knife under your mattress.
You know about this?
What was it doing there?
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, "nothing"?
It's just there. In case.
In case of what?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
If there was a break-in, or...
Show me your arm.
- What?
- Show me your arm.
Leave me alone!
Nicholas.
Why do you do this?
I don't want you to hurt yourself.
Do you understand me?
I don't hurt myself.
Look at those scars.
That's what I call hurting yourself!
It's the opposite.
What do you mean, "the opposite"?
- Nothing.
- No, no, no. Explain it to me.
Explain it to me, Nicholas!
It relieves me.
Relieves you of what?
It relieves you of what, Nicholas?
When I'm in pain...
It's a way to...
Way to channel the pain.
But what pain?
Nicholas, a way to channel what pain?
I don't want you to do this anymore.
I forbid you to do this.
Is that clear?
- Is that clear?
- Yes.
There are some things in life
you just don't do.
- Was it Beth who found it?
- Doesn't matter.
What was she doing
searching through my stuff?
She's not searching through your stuff.
She was kind enough to make your bed.
Since you never make it yourself.
You took a knife out of the kitchen...
No. At first, I just wanted
to have something to defend myself with.
Defend yourself from what?
What are you talking about?
You realize this makes no sense at all?
Well, you have a gun.
What?
In the laundry room,
behind the washing machine, there's a gun.
That's different. That was a gift.
Who gave you a gun?
My father. A long time ago.
He loves hunting. It's a hunting rifle.
It's not there so I can "defend myself"...
Why did he give you a hunting rifle?
I don't know.
Maybe he thought I'd like it,
or that it was something
we could do together.
But I never even used it.
I hate hunting,
and everything that goes along with it.
So, why do you keep it?
Nicholas, this is not
what we're talking about.
I don't understand
why you're doing this kind of thing.
I know.
What happened at your last school?
This might be the time
to tell me about it, don't you think?
Because something
must have happened, othennise...
Nicholas...
If you don't wanna talk to me about it,
I hope you talk to your therapist.
Please, this is important.
Come on, it's okay.
- I'll go get some disinfectant.
- No, it's just scratches.
You know...
When you hurt yourself...
It's as if you're doing it to me.
And when you hurt mom,
you were doing it to me.
Hi, everybody.
Thanks, everybody, for being here.
We have the pick of the bunch
with us today.
- Steven, can you get me a coffee?
- Yes, sir.
Good. We have a lot to get through, so...
Let's review the items
we've discussed so far.
The first item on the agenda
is healthcare.
And as you know...
That is a subject and topic
that is close to my heart.
So, on the campaign
I will be focusing on that a lot.
Daddy, are there whales around here?
- Whales?
- Yes.
- No, I don't think so.
- And dolphins?
Dolphins, yeah. You see them sometimes.
Sometimes right by the boat.
- Did you see one?
- Yes.
- Peter!
- Dad!
- Quick, it's in the sea!
- What?
My hat!
Thank you. Have a good day now.
Ah, you're early.
- Hello, dad.
- Hello. Come in.
Okay.
Would you like a drink?
Uh, yeah. Why not?
- Ice?
- No.
No. Okay.
No ice.
To what do I owe the honor of this, um...
Spontaneous visit?
No particular reason.
I was just passing through D.C.,
and wanted to see how you were doing.
Don't listen to the rumors
about my health.
There's nothing wrong with me.
Uh, just a minor complaint.
I've never been fitter.
Uh, Maria has, uh,
prepared a little something,
- a little lunch for us.
- Mm-hm.
- Duck. How does that sound?
- Hm.
- Great.
- Good. Cheers.
Cheers.
Welcome.
No, the problem these days is,
people are scared of everything.
Just look around you.
Bunch of sniveling cowards.
Nobody ever wants
to take any kind of a risk anymore.
That's why the west
is not going to last much longer.
And I've been saying it for years,
and the facts are beginning
to bear me out.
You know, if you're looking for energy,
courage, enterprise...
I'm sorry to say this,
but, uh, you have to go to Asia.
The coming decades,
it won't be Washington,
it'll be China, Beijing.
Uh, no, thank you, Maria.
It was delicious.
- My pleasure.
- Thanks.
No, thanks.
What about you? Tell me...
I thought you hated this city.
What are you doing
in this neck of the woods?
- I had a meeting with Brian hammer.
- Oh.
Yeah. He's gonna stand in the primaries.
Yes, I know.
And he wants me to, uh,
help him with his campaign.
- He's offered to take you on his team?
- Yes.
But I haven't decided
if I'm going to accept.
Why not?
Well, problem is, it'll just take up
too much of my time, and...
So it's complicated.
- What's complicated about it?
- It's not a very good time.
Uh, Nicholas is going through
a difficult spell.
He's 17. And, uh...
He's come to live with me,
and he's improving,
but I think he's still a little fragile.
So I just wouldn't wanna be away
when he's, um...
What?
Is that why you came to see me?
To tell me what a good dad you are?
- No.
- Obviously, it is.
You came to show me irrefutable proof
of your moral superiority.
Is that it?
To demonstrate to me that you can give up
your ambitions to look after your son.
As opposed to me, right?
Not at all.
So, you're still at it, huh? Really?
Blaming me for what happened,
what, 40 years ago?
Still trying to show me
what a model dad you are?
Wow.
So, what do you want? Applause?
Bravo.
It's funny you should say that,
because, uh...
Just the other day, I was thinking again
about the time when I was Nicholas's age.
- See.
- Yeah. When mom was ill.
I went to see her in the hospital
every day after school
and sat with her,
and you never showed up.
You were traveling all the time.
I was working.
But the week before she died,
I ran into Tom.
And he told me that he'd had dinner
with you the night before.
I didn't even know you were in town.
You didn't think it was worth telling us,
or coming to see her?
Listen, if it suits you,
I can easily take on the role of monster
and bow to your perfection.
Yes, you have suffered so much. And, uh...
Your daddy was not nice to you,
nor to your momma. Fine.
So what?
Don't you think
it's time you started growing up?
Because, believe me, it is pathetic...
Watching a man of 50
chained to the teenager he once was.
If you want my advice, Peter...
Just fucking get over it,
for god's sake.
Just fucking get over it.
Please.
Excuse me.
Hello, Harry.
The meeting's at four o'clock.
That's right. Four, not four-thirty. Four.
You all right?
Is it a drag going out?
No. On the contrary.
- You eating cereal?
- Yeah.
Wouldn't you like
to do something more exciting?
- It's Saturday night.
- So?
Wouldn't you like to see a movie,
or meet your friends?
I don't have any friends.
Why say that?
Because it's the truth.
You used to have, uh, Michael.
You used to see him a lot.
Hey, what about that party
you told me about?
- All right, dad.
- What?
Can you stop now?
All right.
- Can I?
- Yeah.
I haven't had these for ages.
Oh!
Ready?
-Oh!
- Wait. I'm not ready. I'm not ready!
- Ready?
That's terrible.
They're sticking. Ready? Go.
- Did you get it?
- No.
You guys haven't seen my earrings,
have you?
I literally had them
in my hand just now, and...
Have you looked in the bathroom?
Yes, I have. I've checked everywhere.
I don't understand it.
I think I must be losing it.
Oh. Yeah. Hello.
Yes.
Oh, hey, kiddo. Yeah.
- You haven't seen them, have you?
- What?
You know my earrings, the red ones?
The ones your dad got me.
I literally had them in my hand
a second ago.
God, I just keep losing things.
You changed your dress?
That one looks good on you.
Thank you. That's really sweet of you.
No, it's true. You look beautiful.
Where are you going?
Nowhere special. Just dinner with friends.
Frank. You know frank?
Well, I say "nowhere special,"
but in fact it is pretty special.
It's literally the first time
we've gone out since Theo was born.
Little word of advice,
if you wanna go on having a life,
do not have a kid.
I'm joking.
All right. Bad news. Sarah stood us up.
- What?
- She just called.
- Just now? Last minute?
- Yeah, she has a fever. Sorry...
- Who's Sarah?
- Uh, the sitter.
- Shall I call Jenny?
- I already did. She's not free.
Oh, my god. Oh, great.
The one time we can go out.
What should I do?
Call frank? Cancel, or...?
- Um...
- You want me to look after him?
You?
- You think you could handle it?
- Yeah, if it would help.
- Uh... god, that's so kind of you...
- Why not?
- That's really sweet of you, but...
- Are you sure?
I'm sure. Just call frank.
We'd better cancel.
Okay, whatever.
What?
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Why do you think?
He made a kind suggestion.
I don't know why you refused.
- You don't?
- No.
He's his little brother.
He can look after him.
Okay, I'm just not sure.
- He's a baby and I just don't...
- And what?
You always see things
in such a dark light.
It's better to see something
in a dark light than to not see it at all!
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.
- Tell me. What am I not seeing?
- Nothing. Stop.
You really believe Nicholas is not capable
of looking after his little brother
when he's asleep?
Oh, god. You know very well.
He's been depressed.
He's still unstable. He's even...
I'm sorry if this shocks you,
but I'm not gonna leave my son with a...
With what?
Go on, say it.
You're not gonna leave your son with what?
He's weird. Don't say that he isn't.
In fact, he's extremely weird.
The look in his eye is disturbing.
When are you gonna face up to the fact
that he's not right in the head?
Nicholas. Hey, you, um...
What are you, uh...?
Sorry, we were just...
We were just disappointed
we couldn't go out tonight.
It has nothing to do with you.
Nicholas...
They were in the hallway.
No, Nicholas, please...
Nicholas. What are you...?
Are you all right?
Your dad told me
you're happy at your new school.
Aren't you?
Huh?
He told me everything's okay for you
at his place.
I was hoping that...
But in the end, there's no room for me.
They find me disturbing
more than anything else, and...
He puts so much pressure on me.
Your dad?
He doesn't realize it, but...
He never stops talking about schoolwork.
As if that's all there was to life.
No, it's normal. He worries about you.
No, he doesn't give a shit about me.
I mean, about who I really am.
He just wants me to succeed like him.
The way he has. But...
I have no desire
to become a law student, or a lawyer.
It just doesn't interest me.
You used to dream about being a writer.
Are you still writing?
Huh?
I don't think I'm ever gonna measure up.
What are you talking about?
Nicholas,
your father wants what's best for you.
He loves you. He believes in you.
You're just two very different people.
And he's under
a lot of pressure right now.
All this business with the primaries,
don't you think?
And it's important to him.
You know,
it's a dream he's had for a lot of years.
It's not just that.
I'm not well, morn.
Your dad told me
you'd broken up with a girl.
Yes, that's what I told him.
He didn't understand what was wrong.
He needed a rational explanation.
You know what he's like.
So I told him what he wanted to hear.
I never even went out
with that girl. It's just...
It's just, I'm not made like other people.
Sometimes I feel like
I'm not made for this life.
And I can't deal with any of it.
Even so, I try, every day,
with all my strength.
But I just can't deal with any of it,
because...
Because I'm in pain.
All the time.
And I'm tired.
I'm tired of being in pain.
Oh! Nicholas. Come here.
I'm right here.
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.
And I will help you get through this.
I promise.
Don't cry, my little sunbeam.
It's okay.
It's okay.
What?
Today? Are you sure it was him?
- Nicholas.
- Yeah?
Can you come here for a couple of minutes?
I'd like to talk to you.
- What is it?
- Sit down.
- We need to talk.
- What about?
About your school.
What's going on?
- Nothing special. Why?
- Nothing special?
Today you had your practice test, right?
- How'd that go?
- Went well, I think.
Only, you see, this afternoon,
Beth went to the park and she saw you.
I don't know what you were doing,
but in any case you weren't at school.
So, I'm gonna ask you one last time.
This time I want an answer.
What's going on?
Have you started to skip classes again?
- Is that it?
- No. I...
Then why weren't you in school today?
- Why did she tell you that?
- That's not the problem.
Yes, it is the problem.
She wants to turn us against one another.
The problem is you're fucking lying to me.
Why weren't you at school today?
I'm listening!
I wasn't feeling well.
I couldn't bring myself to go. And...
I'm under too much pressure
from this test.
I'm sorry.
You're sorry?
I called the school.
And you know what they told me?
They told me you'd never been back there.
They told me you were there
on the first day, last month,
and aftennards you never came back.
Never. Not once.
It seems they got an e-mail from me,
saying we'd decided to send you back
to your old school.
You've nothing to say?
So, you've become a world-class hacker,
am I right?
When I think you had the balls
to tell me you were getting a's,
being invited to parties,
and the whole time you were lying to me.
I mean, what did you do all these days?
Just go for walks?
Is that it? You just...
We give you a chance to climb back up,
and what do you do?
You do the exact same thing.
You lie to everybody!
Explain it to me.
What's going on?
Are you on drugs?
Then explain it to me!
I don't know what else to do with you.
I'm telling you straight,
I just don't know.
I've tried to listen to you,
I've tried to be there for you.
I've tried to give you strength
and confidence,
but obviously none of that's any use.
You really think
you can just live your life like that?
Doing whatever the hell you feel like?
Getting out of school, never taking
any responsibility, refusing to grow up.
What are you gonna do with your life,
if you're not doing anything,
what's gonna become of you?
Naturally, you have no answer.
Stop staring at me like that.
Vvhatstheidea?
Are you trying to intimidate me?
That's not gonna work,
I can tell you that right away.
Not with me.
All right.
I'm gonna explain to you
how it's gonna be.
Starting tomorrow,
whether you like it or not,
you're going back to school.
- Is that clear?
- No.
Sorry?
I'm saying no,
I will not go back to school.
What are you doing, Nicholas?
What do you want?
When I was your age, my mother was sick,
I wasn't seeing my father anymore,
I had money problems,
but I fought on. I fought on!
And believe me, most days it was no joke.
And what has happened to you?
What is there in your life
that is so dramatic
you're not able to go to school
like everybody else?
- Answer me. Answer me!
- I can't deal with it!
I don't understand what that means.
You can't deal with what?
Living! I can't deal with living,
and it's your fault!
Sorry?
- If I'm like this, it's your fault.
- What have I done? What's my fault?
- You disgust me.
- What did you say?
You give all these big speeches
about life and work,
and then you abandon us
as if we were pieces of shit.
What?
You think you always do the right thing.
But right from the beginning
you've basically been an asshole!
Take back what you just said, Nicholas.
Do you hear me?
You take back what you just said. Now.
Asshole!
Me, an asshole? Me?
Haven't I always done everything for you?
I stayed with your mother for years
for your sake.
So why are you saying this? Why?
Why? Tell me why?
Is it because I fell in love
with another woman?
Is that my crime?
How is that any of your business?
I have the right
to reinvent my life! Fuck!
It's my life, do you hear me?
It is my life!
I'm sorry, Nicholas.
I don't know what just happened.
Hi. I need the, urn, psychiatric ward.
- Down on the left.
- Okay.
How long you been here?
About half an hour.
They told me
they would be out to see us soon.
But what happened?
I wasn't there. I was working.
It was, um...
It was Beth who found him,
in the bathroom.
He'd just...
We were lucky.
The ambulance arrived very quickly and...
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
You know, I wanted so much to help him.
And then, in the end, I...
Doctor.
Hi. Yes, good afternoon. I'm Dr. Leiner.
I'm looking after your son.
- Where's Nicholas?
- Don't worry.
He's resting.
He's no longer in danger, I assure you.
Please.
Thanks.
Your son was treated very quickly
and the cut wasn't too deep.
So it should heal well.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes. Trust me.
But we do need to make some decisions.
Now I just talked to him.
What'd he say?
He seems frustrated to have woken up here.
Which is very common in this sort of case.
Has he said anything
about what caused him to...?
You know,
we're very used to these situations.
And, I think,
it could be important for Nicholas
to spend some time under observation.
You mean...
I just checked
and we do have a vacancy in our facility.
You just said he was out of danger.
What we want is for him
to become aware of what he's done.
His tendency at the moment
is to minimize it somewhat,
which seems to me dangerous.
We wouldn't want him to try it again.
Um...
And how long would he need to stay?
What's important is for us
to be able to monitor and treat him.
And then there'll be regular visits
with the in-patient psychiatrist
and Nicholas,
so we can all assess his progress.
I wanna see my son.
Just a second, please.
Please excuse me,
I'm needed upstairs.
But a social worker will be in
to help you with the papennork
for Nicholas to be admitted. Okay?
Uh, she'll be able to help you
with any other questions at this point.
All right?
Please don't worry.
He's in very good hands now.
What about that one?
That's a constellation. See?
- You can see little stars in it.
- Is it rare?
- Pretty rare.
- And that one?
That is a saturn.
It's got rings around it.
Peter!
Peter!
Oh, mommy's getting a little impatient.
- Shall we go back?
- Wait, daddy.
- It's split.
- What are we gonna do?
We're gonna have to swim.
I can't. I'm only six and a half.
That's right.
It's just the right time to learn.
You can do it.
Come on.
I'll be with you.
Hey.
Come on, shrimp.
Come on.
- So what have you decided?
- Hm?
Should I move the meeting
to Monday morning?
It depends on what time
you're expecting to leave for DC
next Monday? Uh, no, I can't.
I'm gonna have to, uh...
I'm gonna have to stay in New York.
So, I'll cancel Washington?
Thanks.
Hey.
Hey, Peter. It's me.
Uh, can you talk?
Sure. Everything all right?
Yeah, uh, well,
I just got a call from Dr. Harris
and, um,
I just wanted to discuss it with you.
Is there a problem?
Well, he thinks that it might be better
if we don't go see Nicholas
for a few days.
What?
I know.
But it seems that Nicholas is having
some trouble accepting treatment.
And they've been having
long conversations,
you know, trying to...
Understand why he, um...
It seems he's, um,
been talking a lot about the divorce,
and your new life, and all the, uh,
tension that's between you and I.
And, um...
Dr. Harris thinks
that maybe it's best to just let them...
Have a few days. You know?
Give everyone a bit of perspective.
Take the pressure off.
Listen, he can't stop us seeing Nicholas.
He was just asking,
you know, not demanding.
We still have Monday.
You know, we have our appointment
to just see where everything stands.
And...
I don't know, in the meantime...
I know this is so difficult.
It is for me, too, you know.
But maybe we should trust them, huh?
You think?
Peter?
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- What time's the plane?
- Uh...
I've got a cab. It's about five minutes.
I'll help you down with your suitcase.
No, no, no, don't worry.
Listen, I'm...
I'm sorry about last night. I...
- I really, I had too much to drink, and...
- Just stop.
I just don't understand
why we have to fight like that.
I know.
It's my fault. I'm sorry.
And you...
And you can't come with us?
Sorry, Beth, I can't. I just...
I don't feel like going to the cape,
knowing he's in there.
Just for two days.
You look terrible. And it's not like
you can do anything for him here.
I can't.
Okay.
So when is he cut?
I don't know. I'll know more on Monday.
And then?
I hope I can be a better father to Theo.
Stop it, Peter.
You're a really good father.
What makes me sad
is to have to play a part that I hate
with everything in me.
And these last few weeks, I just...
Keep catching myself saying things.
Exactly the same things my father
used to say to me when I was young.
Things which made me genuinely hate him.
And now it's my turn. And it just...
I don't know, that makes me think
I've wound up being just like him.
Well, what kind of things?
"What are you gonna do with your life?"
"When I was your age,
I did this, I did that."
"What are we gonna do with you?"
If you knew how ashamed
it makes me feel...
I'm sorry.
Um, we have to go.
Before you do, please tell me
you forgive me for yesterday.
I would just really like us
to stop fighting like that.
Me, too.
The last few weeks have just been...
- I know.
- No, you don't know.
Because you're not here.
You're at work all of the time.
And I'm here, and I'm on my own.
- No, you're not on your own.
- Yes, I am. I'm on my own, and I'm...
I'm so tired. And I just...
There's Theo, your other son.
He needs you as well.
Beth, please, let's...
Let's not start again, okay?
Okay.
Okay. Okay.
I'll call you when we get there.
Come here, little man. Come here. Oh!
Give me a hug.
I'm not gonna see you for a week.
I'm gonna miss you.
You're gonna discover the sea.
See how big and beautiful it is.
Say hello from me to granny, will you?
Sorry I can't be with you.
But I really have to stay here.
You understand?
You tell me all about it, okay?
You'll tell me, little man.
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you so much.
I feel like I haven't seen you for months.
We're here now. We're here.
Uh, Nicholas?
I'm gonna leave you alone for five minutes
with your mom and dad,
like you asked me to.
And while it's happening,
I'm gonna look for the doctor. Okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Hey, how are you?
Honey.
It's horrible,
you have to get me out of here.
Hey, don't worry.
You absolutely have
to get me out of here. Promise me.
What's wrong?
It's been terrible, mom.
It's the worst week of my life.
It's hell. You can't leave me in hell.
That's what we're here for.
We're gonna discuss it with the doctor.
He's an asshole.
He doesn't understand anything.
He stuffs me full of medication.
And he thinks I'm ill.
He says I'm gonna have
to stay here for weeks.
But I'm telling you, I can't.
I won't be able to take it.
I feel much worse here than I do at home.
I need you.
You have to take me back home.
Please, dad. Please, mom. I'm begging you.
Okay, calm down.
Nicholas, we'll talk to the doctor.
We're here. We're here with you.
I'm so happy to see you.
- Good afternoon.
- Doctor.
Okay, why don't we all sit down?
It's okay.
Sit by me, please, Nicholas.
I'm gonna ask Michael,
who's been looking after Nicholas,
to sit in with us.
- If you don't mind?
- All right.
Great.
Now...
I guess Nicholas has told you
that he wants to leave the hospital.
Yeah, he said that to me too.
I understand that these last few days
have been tough on him.
They really have. Why is that?
We often get this reaction
in the first week.
I don't wanna stay here.
I understand that you wanna go home,
Nicholas. I really do. But...
It isn't something
that I'd be able to recommend.
You see?
Why not?
Nicholas is suffering
from acute depression.
I think it would be safer for him
to stay in the hospital.
I'm better.
I just wanna come back home.
There isn't gonna be a problem, I promise.
I know that's what you believe, Nicholas,
but in my experience...
You see, he knows
how I'm feeling better than I do!
Calm down, Nicholas.
I am calm, it's this moron
who doesn't understand anything!
Nicholas, please, honey.
Nicholas...
Please, sit down.
Okay.
What do you suggest?
Essentially, we just need some more time.
Suicidal impulses...
They're really difficult to identify,
even for the patient.
But we can't pretend
that they don't exist.
Second attempts are very common.
I think Nicholas is still suffering
from a certain...
Disconnect from reality,
which is causing him
all kind of anxieties,
which we can treat.
We just need to stabilize him first.
And then we can start thinking
about when to let him go.
- And when would that be?
- Mom.
I'm just asking.
You see, Nicholas,
right now you need looking after.
You need the whole medical team.
The doctors,
the therapists, project supervisors.
You think you're gonna cure me
with pottery class?
It contributes to the process, yes.
It's a bunch of crap!
- Maybe it's for your own good.
- My own good?
How can I get better if I'm surrounded
by people who are much sicker than I am?
I've been thinking about this a lot.
About my life.
All these hours doing nothing.
I understand things.
Things I won't do anymore.
Being here has been like
an electric shock.
And now, I feel I'm ready
to return to normal life.
I feel I can go back to school. I feel it.
But you've gotta trust me.
And you've got to take me out of here.
Othennise...
I'm going under.
I mean it. I can't take this.
Dad.
You know me. I know you do.
You always have.
But here, they don't.
I'm begging you, dad.
Please don't abandon me.
Oh, sweetheart.
- Can you?
- Yeah.
What would be the procedure
for taking him out?
As long as he's underage,
Nicholas is your responsibility.
And that would be your decision.
But please listen very seriously
to what I'm telling you.
Your son is not in a state to leave here.
All you have to do is sign the papers
and he can go home.
But it's my professional opinion,
you'd be taking a genuine risk.
What risk?
A risk that I would never take
with my own son.
You can't force me to stay here.
Well, you know, technically, I could.
But I would have to get a judge to agree,
and I really don't wanna have to do that.
I'd rather help your parents
make the right decision.
Mom, dad...
Believe me, I know that this isn't easy,
especially here, right now,
in front of your son. But...
Nicholas needs treatment.
And that's not part of your role,
as parents.
That's a job for a psychiatrist.
Dad, I'm not ill.
If we make the right decision together,
then Nicholas will be able
to come back to you sooner
in much better health.
Lead a normal life.
Mom, I wanna go home.
I know, sweetheart.
- Don't leave me here. I'm begging you.
- Peter, say something.
You have to give me a second chance.
It was a cry for help,
and I'm sorry about it with all my heart.
I just need you to understand my pain.
But I'll never do it again.
I swear to you.
I think your parents have heard
your arguments, Nicholas.
Please.
Now, I'm gonna have to ask you
to make a decision.
Now?
Yes, Nicholas needs to understand
that you support the medical team.
Don't feel guilty.
This is not about
how much you love your son.
It's about protecting him.
In these circumstances,
love is not enough.
Love will not be enough.
Dad.
Mom.
All right, Nicholas, it's lunchtime.
Michael's gonna take you up
to the cafeteria. But first...
It's important that your parents
make their decision in front of you.
It'll help you accept your treatment.
Mom, I wanna go home.
Dad, take me home. I'm begging you, dad.
Dad, take me home.
Dad.
I'm sorry, Nicholas.
You can't do this to me! Dad, not you!
Nicholas, calm down.
What did I ever do to you? Dad!
Don't touch me! Dad! Daddy!
Mom! Mom! Dad! Dad!
All right?
I hope we made the right decision.
He said it was a cry for help.
We have to trust him.
Listen, if he doesn't improve
in the next few days,
- we can always take him back.
- Right.
But look...
I know he's better off here with us.
- All right.
- It'll be ready in a minute.
Okay.
What are you seeing? I mean...
Moving fonnard.
Uh... seems a little optimistic
to hope he'll go back to school.
- It's may already.
- Yeah.
Maybe he just needs to...
Get his strength back, right? And...
Start the next school year fresh.
What's he gonna do during the day?
We can't ever leave him on his own.
Maybe he could go back to live with you?
If that's what he wants. And, uh...
During the day,
I could take him to the office, to work.
I mean, as an intern, or...
You think he'll be interested in that?
I don't know.
In any case, he'd learn a few new things.
And I'd be there, so...
Yeah. But don't you have
so much work going on?
I'm gonna turn down Brian's offer.
Seriously?
Yeah, I don't give a shit
about politics. I just...
I wanna concentrate on what really counts.
And, for me, what really counts
is to be here, for Nicholas.
Here we go.
Hey, thank you.
- That's nice.
- Oh.
Where's your cup?
No, I had a coffee. I needed to wake up.
Sugar?
No, thanks, buddy.
- Dad?
- No.
Thank you.
Thanks, baby.
How are you feeling?
So happy to be here with you.
So are we.
Mm.
I better get the prescription from you.
Oh, yeah.
And I was thinking...
Would you wanna maybe see a movie?
- Why not?
- Yeah?
Yeah. But, um,
I'd like to take a shower first.
The, uh, bathrooms in there were so dirty.
I've been dreaming about having a shower
for a whole week.
Yeah, sure.
- What?
- Nothing.
- Why are you laughing?
- It's nothing.
- I smell bad, is that it?
- No, no.
I like seeing you together.
It's been a long time.
I mean,
since the three of us were together.
That's true.
It's like the good old days.
Right. I'll go take a shower.
I'll wait for you.
I just wanted to say...
I'm really sorry about everything.
And I know you don't deserve it.
I'd like to ask you to forgive me.
And I wanted to tell you...
That I love you.
- We love you too.
- Yeah.
Go on, off you go.
We'll be waiting for you.
- How about that?
- I know.
I mean...
Why don't you come
to the movies with us today?
I'm sure
that would make Nicholas so happy.
I don't know.
What were you planning to see?
Remember when we...
Used to go to the movies
in the middle of the afternoon?
And tell everybody
we had very important meetings.
And then we'd sneak away
and meet at the angelika.
Oh, yeah.
I loved doing that.
It was like playing hooky.
- All so long ago, huh?
- Hm.
Come on.
Come with us.
Come with us today.
Don't you want to?
[Gunshofl
- Oh, god!
- Oh, my god!
What is it?
What is it?
Oh, my god, Nicholas! Nicholas, baby.
Keep your eyes open. Peter! Call somebody!
Please, Nicholas.
Look at mommy. Look at mommy.
Keep your eyes open.
Baby, please, please, keep your eyes open.
That's it. Trust yourself.
And a breath, that's it. Like a froggy.
Come to me. Come to me. Come to me.
Okay, I'm gonna let you go.
You can do it. Come to me. That's it!
Keep going.
Keep going. That's it.
- Daddy, I'm swimming!
- Yes, you're swimming.
I'm swimming, daddy!
Yes, you are! You're swimming! Oh!
- Finally.
- You did it.
- I'm swimming.
- Good boy. Good boy.
I'm real proud of you. You're swimming.
It's good, right?
Shall we go for some more?
Come on. Let's swim out there. Let's swim.
Good. That's it. All the way.
Can you keep coming?
Daddy, wait. I can't do it.
You all right?
I'm just gonna go give Theo his bath.
- You want me to do it?
- No, I'll do it.
- Are you glad they're coming?
- Very. What about you?
Look what I found.
Ah, you haven't worn them in a long time.
I know.
Okay. I'll see you in a minute.
Can I leave the rest to you?
Sure.
Theo?
It's bath time.
- Mom.
- You ready?
Hey. Here already?
- Sorry, I'm a bit early.
- Come in. Are you on your own?
Oh, she's on her way.
Had to see her mother first.
No problem.
Come in.
- How are you? You look good.
- Very good, thanks. How are you?
Good. So, you, uh, got back this morning?
Yeah, it's been months
since I set foot in New York.
- I was starting to miss it.
- And how's Toronto? All going well?
Great. I love the city.
Good. You want a drink or something?
- Uh, no. I'll wait for everyone else.
- Okay. Sit down.
You know, I've decided
to move in with Lena.
- Did mom tell you?
- Really?
Yeah, well, we basically
already spend every evening
at either her place or mine, so...
Congratulations. That's good news.
Yeah, I'm really looking fonrvard
to introducing her to you.
Yeah, I'm really looking fonrvard
to meeting her.
I mean, after everything
you've been telling me about her.
You'll see. She's wonderful.
I'm crazy about her.
That's good.
How's Theo? Is he here?
Yeah, he'sjust having his bath.
Um, we got him a gift.
-Um...
- But Lena wanted to give it to him, so...
- That's nice.
I also have something for you.
For me?
Well, it's more something
I wanted to tell you about.
You should see the look on your face.
Don't worry, I'm not here
to tell you I'm gonna be a father.
Never crossed my mind.
No, it's, um, something more...
Something about me...
That I wanted you
to be the first to know.
Tell me.
Well...
You know how, besides college,
there was always something else I loved.
Writing.
And, uh, recently I've spent some time...
Especially since
I've been living in Toronto.
Everything just seems easier
for me up there.
In short...
Here it is.
What's this?
It's my first novel.
You wrote this?
I didn't wanna tell anyone,
out of superstition.
But now it actually exists.
I wanted you
to be the first person to have it.
Death can wait.
Fantastic.
- When's it coming out?
- In two months.
And if you open it,
you'll see it's, uh, dedicated to you.
Obviously, it talks a bit about
what you already know.
All those really tough years
for you and mom.
But at least it ended well.
And...
I wanted you to be the first person
to have it because...
I know that if it wasn't for you,
I couldn't have...
I'm so proud of you.
My big boy.
I'm so proud of you.
Better wait till you've read it.
You might not like it.
I know you.
I know it'll be beautiful.
And really...
What I wanna tell you
is I'm so proud of you.
- You're not gonna start crying, are you?
- No, no, no. Sorry.
Now I just have to hope
it'll be a success.
Of course it'll be a success.
You don't mind if I go give Theo a hug?
I've missed him a lot, too.
Yes, of course.
He'll be glad to see you.
He's always talking about his big brother.
Peter?
What are you doing?
What's the matter?
Were you thinking about Nicholas?
I should have paid more attention to him.
No, you did the best
you possibly could at the time.
I was trying to think...
He was, uh...
He was so talented.
And he was so intelligent.
And sensitive.
And...
He could have done
so many beautiful things with his life.
And I should have...
I really could have...
It's all my fault.
- No, it's not. You did the best you could.
- Oh, god, it's all my...
No, it's not. Come on.
Come on. Come here.
Calm down.
I know it's hard, I know,
but life goes on, Peter.
Okay?
There's Theo. And you got me.
And we need you.
Even if it's hard, even if it hurts,
life goes on, Peter.
No, it doesn't go on. It can't go on.
Shh, shh, shh.
Yes, it does. Yes, it does.
Shh.
Calm down. Calm down.
Just think about your little boy.
Think about Theo.
He's gonna be four soon.
Think about him
and everything will be all right.
