...whose wicked ambition to
conquer and dominate the...
...whole world, caused pain
and misery to one and all.
And in Kaushala,
a kingdom in north India...
...people prospered under
the benevolent ruler, Dashrath.
However, Kaushala's capital
Ayodhya's biggest concern...
...was that King Dashrath
had no heir.
On the advice of
sage Vashishtha...
...King Dashrath
performed a Yajna...
...the ceremony
to beget a son.
And as a result he was
blessed with four sons...
...from his three queens.
One of them was Ram...
...the hero of this story...
...born of Dashrath's
first queen, Kaushalya.
Whenever there have
been crisis on the earth...
...Lord Vishnu has
descended from the heavens...
...for its salvation.
Lord Vishnu has
ten incarnations...
...and Ram is believed to
be his seventh incarnation.
When Ram turned fifteen...
...Ravan was at
the peak of his powers.
Ravan's relation, Marich...
...along with his mother Tadaka...
...was a terror for sage
Vishwamitra and other hermits...
...who lived in a forest
close to Ayodhya's border.
They disturbed Vishwamitra's
prayers, everyday.
And on one such day...
O Lord Vishnu...
...is there no one who can
save us from this torment?
His name is Ram.
First born prince of
King Dashrath, of Ayodhya.
O sage of sages...
...my court is indeed
blessed by your presence.
What is it that
you desire of me?
Let me fulfil your command!
O noble king of
the Solar Dynasty...
...the demons ruined
the sacred land...
...and we are in great trouble.
I need your...
...eldest son Ram to destroy them.
Ram!? He is but a mere boy.
I, myself, shall wipe them
off from the face of this earth.
This is a command from the Gods...
...O King, do you dare reject it?
Dashrath, send your sons...
...Ram and Lakshman.
Vishwamitra is strong and wise...
...and has mastery
over every weapon.
He will protect your sons.
Ram... Lakshman...
...come here, my sons!
O sage Vishwamitra...
...I leave my sons with you.
Give them guidance and courage.
Bless you, King Dashrath!
You have made a decision
that shall save the world.
We will obey you
like we obey our father.
Your wishes will
be our command.
You know, once this
was a beautiful forest...
...but now it has dried up
because of a terrible cannibal...
...a demoness called Tadaka.
Her son, the evil Marich...
...leads the demons...
...who defile the holy fires.
Ram, you must kill Tadaka.
That is your dharma!
Your duty as a Kshatriya!
I shall teach you Mantras...
They will guide you.
Now... repeat after me.
Stop it!
That mantra tears apart...
Ram, use the mantra.
Recite the mantra!
Many years ago...
...in this very place...
...the Gods rewarded
my long years of penance...
...with the mastery
of supreme weapons.
The time has now come...
...for me to pass
on these weapons...
...to one worthy of them.
Take them, Ram,
and use them well.
They are now yours.
Use them to protect 'Dharma'.
That's him!
The one who killed my mother.
I shall avenge
her with his blood...
...this I swear!
Watch out!
You used the divine weapons!
How did you learn so soon?
These are the weapons of the Gods.
And the righteous one needs
no lessons to use them.
Show me, my Guru...
...how to use this Chakra?
You will learn but only
if you pursue your destiny...
...in righteousness.
Listen all!
This is the great bow of Shiva!
He who lifts it and strings it...
...shall receive a
great reward from King Janak.
The winner shall be given...
...the hand of Princess Sita.
...in marriage.
Next, the Prince Jagtara of Sorav.
Next, the Prince Ram of Ayodhya.
Congratulations on
your wedding, Prince Ram.
Years passed.
Ayodhya grows and prospers.
And the people loved Ram.
Their prince and king-to-be.
The four brothers live in harmony...
...and their future looks full of hope.
My people, this morning I awoke
from a dream full of omens.
Guru Vashishtha sees in them...
...the coming of troubled times.
But my health is failing...
I am getting old and...
...have no more power
to resist those evil forces.
I have, therefore, decided...
...that Ram will succeed me.
He will be the
next king of Ayodhya.
Ram, my son, come forward.
Ram, try to live up
to the people's expectations.
I have faith in you.
I will do my utmost...
...to live up to the
ideals you have set for us.
Long live Ayodhya!
Long live King Dashrath!
Long live Prince Ram!
Get away... get away.
Noisy wretched things!
Manthara, stop abusing the birds.
Aah... Kekeyi, is this the time...
...to beautify yourself?
When great misfortune
creeps upon the kingdom?
Manthara, don't you understand?
Our beloved Ram is to be anointed...
...crown prince tomorrow.
And so I said,
it is a misfortune.
Oh Kekeyi...
...you are so innocent!
So trusting! And look...
...look how King Dashrath
has betrayed your trust!?
Hold your tongue, Manthara.
I will never allow you to
speak of the King in this way.
Why? Why do you think...
...the king sent Bharat away, now?
So conveniently...
... before the coronation! Why!?
Why? I wonder why he did that?
Kaushalya might have suggested it...
...to the king. Yes!
You know you are the
king's favourite queen...
...and Kaushalya hates you for that.
She is jealous... jealous...
...of your youth
and beauty, aah!
What can I do?
Leave everything...
...to this loyal
and clever Manthara.
What's happened?
Why this sorrow, this anger...
...on such an auspicious night?
What can I do?
Come, tell me.
Tell me O King,
do you remember when you were...
...injured in a
battle some years ago?
I drove you to safety...
...and you promised to
fulfil two boons of mine.
You must grant me...
...those two boons, now!
Only two boons!?
You can have more,
if you want.
No, I don't need more than two.
The first is...
No... I cannot grant you...
...those, Kekeyi. Not those!
I will give you all my wealth.
Will that please you? - No.
Do you wanted to be known...
...that a king of Solar Dynasty
went back on his words.
I will be content...
...with only those two boons.
The boons were...
...one, Kekeyi's son,
Bharat, to be made king...
...and two,
Ram to be banished...
...to the forest
for fourteen years.
Brother, can you not hear
the people's voices?
Lakshman, this
is part of my fate.
But are we, on that
account to sit still...
...and do nothing?
This sword...
...is it only an ornament,
just a plaything?
Brother, you are part
of my self, sharing...
...the same soul with me.
Please...
...try to understand me.
My Lord, I am
coming with you.
But Sita, you...
A husband's duty
is his wife's too.
Your fate is equally mine.
- That's right!
And the same soul should
follow the same fate.
And so brother, I, too,
am coming with you.
Thank you!
Mother... take heart!
Fourteen years will
pass very quickly.
And I will be back, seeking your
blessings in not time at all.
Yes, my son. - Ram!
Ram, why don't
you blame me?
Why don't you bear
a grudge against me?
That would ease my guilt.
I don't want the kingdom.
Nor the power.
All I want are your blessings
before we depart. Father!
My son, bring glory to our
great line of kings.
Come back safe.
Who in the world can
boast of a son like you?
Sumantra...
...get ready the chariots,
the elephants, horses and...
...foot soldiers to accompany
Ram to the forest.
Yes, your majesty!
Father, when nature herself
will take care of me...
...what use I have of an army,
of royal pageantry?
Of course, you will
give Bharat this kingdom...
...after draining if
off all its wealth.
Mother, give your blessings
to your departing son.
Ram don't leave us.
Remain as our king.
- Beloved citizens...
You know how
much I love you.
And I know what
love you bear for me.
You will show your
love for me by...
...loving my noble brother, Bharat...
...who is fully worthy of your
love and being your king.
Support him, I beg of you. Support...
...my sorrowful father. People
of Ayodhya, I appeal to you.
Rama... don't go, Rama, Please.
Ram... come back soon!
O my son!
Ram!
Take care...
...Ram, Lakshman, Sita!
You take care too.
And please, look after my father.
I will.
RAM!!!
Six months passed by.
King Dashrath's palace is...
...enveloped in darkness.
Ram...
...forgive your father.
Ram... Ram!
He is free from the
sufferings of this world.
Bharat, Kekeyi's son...
...who was away in Kekeya...
...visiting his grandfather...
...was called back to Ayodhya.
Mother... mother! What is this?
What has happened?
Oh Bharat, you have come at last.
Tell me mother, is it true,
father has passed away?
Oh God!
Then it is true! - Yes.
But he left us a great honour.
- What is it?
What have you done,
you depraved heartless woman?
What perverse tongue
poisoned your mind?
Brother, it is she.
It is this evil hatch
who has sowed the...
...seed of madness
in our mother's heart.
Please...
...please forgive me.
I was only thinking of you two...
...Kekeyi and Bharat's...
- Stop it.
I will cleave your filthy
brain in two. - That's enough.
Don't let her blood
defile our father's soul.
You are no longer my mother...
...let the world know it.
Please forgive me...
...forgive your
poor mother, Bharat...
...please, forgive me.
Forgive me!
What?
What are you saying, Bharat?
Our father is dead!?
Brother...
...I share your grief.
Father... father...
...forgive this poor Ram...
...forgive your son, please.
Ram, I appeal to you...
...absolve me of my mother's sin.
Come, back to Ayodhya and accept...
...the kingdom which is
yours by right. - Bharat...
...what your mother has done
is not in question here.
Remember, the great Emperor
Dashrath has commanded us...
...you to rule the kingdom and I...
...to live in this forest
for fourteen years.
It is our duty to abide
by our father's wishes...
...whether we like it or not.
You have commanded me,
it is enough.
But one thing is certain.
I will not accept
the kingdom for myself.
But for you!
Please bless this
brother of yours...
...to rule the kingdom with
strength and courage.
I will rule for the
next fourteen years...
...but only till you return.
Bharat, my brother. - Ram.
Long live Ram.
Long live Bharat.
What brings my
chief minister out here...
...at this unlikely hour?
Sir, in the forest of
Dandaka and Janasthana...
...they say the holy men are
returning to their ashrams.
They seem to have
gained a new confidence.
Our spies say, it is
the doing of the young...
...prince of Ayodhya,
Prince Ram.
Oh, this boy Ram is
handsome, isn't he?
I've heard this
Ram is a cowards...
...who has been sent into
exile by his own people.
That's right,
my king, but we must...
...do something before
it is too late.
Oh Ram, I can't
wait to see you.
Shurpankha, Ravan's
younger sister...
.disguised as a beautiful
lady comes to Panchvati...
...to entice Ram.
I am Shurpankha.
Ram, you are so beautiful...
...strong and handsome.
I have decided to marry you.
Your wish would be my command...
...were it not for my
wife Sita, there.
Why don't you approach
my brother, Lakshman?
He is also very handsome
and very strong.
Hmm... he is handsome too.
I speak with your interest at
heart. I am only second to Ram.
And I don't think you are the
kind to settle for second best!?
Yes, you are right!
I am the kind to settle only
for the very best.
Come... come. I will introduce
you to... this is my wife Sita.
This ugly one is your
wife!? I will kill her.
Oh... my nose.
My nose!!
Bleeding!
O the Energy which bestows
knowledge to conquer...
...the phenomenon of death...
may please rise... rise...
...and bestow your
blessings! Swaha!
Brother! - What's
happened to you?
O our little sister!
What has happened!?
Ram!? You mean that... that...
prince from Ayodhya!?
Is he the one
who attacked you?
Do not worry, little sister.
I will have these
worms sliced up and...
...and feed the
raybens for breakfast.
Where is my brother Kumbhkarna?
Tell him, I have said, he
must lead the attack.
Just as I feared, my King...
...your brother Kumbhkarna won't
wake up for the next six months.
That Sita... I wish I
could destroy her beauty.
Is she... that beautiful?
There is no one more beautiful
than her in this whole world.
Her waist is slim,
her figure captivating...
...her complexion
like molten gold.
A heavenly made who is
designed for you, my brother.
She is not worthy of that Ram.
There surely is someone
who is worthy of her.
And that someone is you.
Ravan, accompanied by
his uncle Marich...
...sets out to kidnap Sita.
Then... as we planned?
Yes, as we planned!
This is magnificent!!!
And this can
surely deceive Ram.
Oh... how beautiful she is!
Oh! How lovely!
It 'is' real, isn't it?
It's not a dream, is it?
O Ram, won't you
capture the deer for me?
It is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.
For you? I will!
Lakshman, look after Sita.
Brother, remember that this
guy's beauty is Shoorpankha.
Watch out! Watch out for
those treacherous creatures.
All right! Protect Sita.
So, it is a demon,
disguised as a deer!
You might be relieved
that you have killed me.
But you better be worried
about your pretty wife.
What? - Lakshman, Sita...
...help me!
Lakshman, did you hear
that dreadful cry?
Ram is in danger.
He needs your help.
O he will be safe.
Don't worry, sister.
What are you saying?
You wish him dead?
I understand, so,
I will obey you!
Sister, do not step
outside this line.
Within this line you
are safe. I assure you.
Everything goes
just as I planned.
Om Namah Shivay!
(Obeisance to Lord Shiva!)
O virtuous lady...
...I come begging for alms.
Here you are.
Oh, I am surprised.
Somebody has drawn it
to protect you.
I cannot cross it but
you surely can. Come.
No... no.
If you do not feed this hungry
saint with your hands...
...then ruin shall fall upon
your father's and father-in-law's house...
...O noble lady!
Lakshman!? - Ram! - Why did
you leave Sita alone?
Why are you here? - She
insisted I leave when we heard your cry.
Oh no! That was the voice of
demon imitating mine.
I fear the worst. Come...
...let's get back
as soon as we can.
Ram... Ram!
Rescue me!
Lakshman... Ram... help me!
Sita!
You are mine now. - No... no...
Jatayu, help me. No!!
Let her go. She does
not belong to you.
Let me go. Oh!
Jatayu...
Will teach him a lesson.
Jatayu...
Let me go.
No one can save you now.
He tricked me!
He tricked me and abducted my
wife during my absence.
I swear, Lakshman, I swear.
I shall try to vanquish him.
I shall follow that fellow
into the ends of the universe.
I will seek him out.
And I... will destroy him.
Calm down, my brother Ram.
You have always said that...
...anger is not the right
path to justice.
You, who have only the good
of the world at heart...
...must not let anger
plunge you into it.
You are right...
you are right, Lakshman.
Now, it is your turn to lead...
...my little brother
and I will follow.
Lakshman, is this
gentle creature...
...trying to tell us
something about Sita?
It might be showing us
the direction...
...in which Sita has been
taken. Let's go.
Help me! Ram... Ram!!!
Hey, what's this?
Forgive me, Ram...
...I tried to stop him,
but he cantered away.
My old wings were too frail.
Oh Jatayu...
...how can I blame you?
You have given your life's
blood for my beloved wife!
Do not lose heart, Ram.
You will find her again.
Jatayu... Jatayu...
Where are you taking me?
Let me go.
Remember all of you. If anyone
tries to harm her...
...they will die. This lady
here is so noble...
...that even looking at you
makes her impure.
Trijata!? - What is your
majesty wishes me?
I appoint you her keeper.
Whatever she asks for
in the Ashok Van...
...see that she gets it.
- Very well, your Majesty.
She is stubborn. But you must
give her everything she wants.
Except freedom!
Could it be...
...human blood? Yum... yum... yum.
So good!
And arrow!? Painful
if it hits me.
But it doesn't hit me.
I got her!
Thank you! I was a heavenly
creature, cursed to be...
...an ugly demon. And no one
could left the curse.
Only if I were defeated by
a man of justice...
...I could regain my original
self and go back to the heavens.
Thank you, Ram. But...
...there is nothing I can do
for you in return, except...
,,give you advice.
Find Sugriv now.
Sugriv!? Who is he?
It's a lake.
Lakshman, now what do we do?
There seems to be someone over
there. Let's go and...
...ask them about Sugriv.
- That's good idea.
Wait!
And in the great
mother's magic play...
...all of us perform
our little roles.
I never thought I could see a
man of knowledge like you...
...in this wilderness. My name
is Ram and this is my brother Lakshman.
We are the sons of
King Dashrath of Ayodhya.
We come in search of my
beloved wife, Sita...
...who has been carried
away by a demon...
...I know not, where?
Indeed it is a benevolent
destiny that leads me...
...to Prince Ram of Ayodhya.
My name is Hanuman.
And I am minister to
the King Sugriv.
Lakshman, we've been wondering
where to find Sugriv...
...and here is Sugriv's
messenger well coming us.
Indeed kind destiny
has guided us here.
Ram... Lakshman...
...it is indeed an honour to meet
the sons of King Dashrath...
...whose greatness is known in
all four corners of the world.
Under strange circumstances I
heard your name called out...
...Ram!
Not many days ago, a flying
chariot, swift as a wind...
...raced above our heads
and we heard...
...and we heard a lady's
cry for help...
Ram... she cried. Help me Ram!
From the chariot, a small
bundle dropped to the ground.
We've kept it very carefully.
- Where is it? Where is it?
Oh brother, look...
...indeed they are her scarf...
...and the ornaments
in her hair.
Oh Sita... my Sita.
Courage brother, Ram.
You have no time to grieve.
You must act without delay.
I have sworn to rescue Sita
wherever she may be.
Hmm, do well I know
how it hurts...
...to be without one's consort.
My brother Bali, banished
me from my kingdom...
...then used up my wife.
Oh, if only I had the kingdom's
army at my disposal...
...I would send my men to search
the whole world...
...to rescue your wife, Sita.
Look, let us make this
government, O Prince of Ayodhya...
Let us forge our strength in
friendship and swear to relieve...
...the sorrows that have
befallen us both. - Yes, let us.
For the sake of a friend...
...a man should be ready to
give up his wealth...
...and comforts and if
need be life itself.
I will live by this Dharm and...
...help Ram everyway.
I swear it. - I swear it too.
Ram fulfilled the promise given
to Sugriv and forked the mighty Bali.
Bali was defeated and Sugriv
regained his wife and his kingdom.
The monsoon clouds gathered
like a herd of elephants...
...and reclaimed the Rishyamukha
hills for many days.
And when the rain ceased and
the sun shone again Rishyamukha...
...stood like an island.
surrounded by the waters of the flood.
And Sugriv called forth his
great army of monkeys.
When you find my Sita, give
her these ornaments...
...so she may recognize you
as my emissaries.
These are the jewels of my
clan. Please give them to her.
The vanara king Sugriv sent
search parties in all directions...
...keeping his promise to Ram.
Help... it's a tiger. Help!
Look... look... over there.
If a bird comes of it, there
might be some water inside.
Yes, perhaps we will
find some water there.
They have gone inside.
- Gone inside now.
Hey, I can see some light.
That must be the way out. C'mon.
Hanuman, who leads the
party to the south...
...meets Sampaati...
...brother of Jatayu...
...the bird king, killed at
the hands of Ravan.
Where are we?
Are you not Jatayu's
brother, Sampaati!?
Yes, I am Sampaati.
Do you know my brother?
How is my Jatayu?
Is he well?
Jatayu has found a
home in the heavens.
Oh... how sad!
How sad!
My brother to die...
...and I live on.
Old though he was...
...he fought a difficult battle
with an evil demon, Ravan...
...and was slain as he
tried to save...
...Mother Sita from
the demon's clutches?
You said Ravan!?
Ravan is the name!?
If I knew he had
killed my brother...
...I would never have let him...
...fly over this land, unharmed.
He flew over here?
Yes, look...
...across the sea...
...is Lanka.
There you will find...
...and his captive the lady.
If we cross the sea
with all the troops...
...we will need
thousands of boats.
And I am too old now.
Though in my youth I had
circled the earth 21 times.
Now, there is only
one among us...
...who can handle this task.
When you were a boy...
...believing the new born sun
to be a golden fruit...
...you once flew after it...
...meaning to swallow it up.
You had great powers...
...but you did not
know how to use them.
The world was afraid of you...
...and so you were put
under a spell...
...that sealed your powers.
But the time has not
come for me...
...to unseal these
hidden powers.
Only you can cross the sea
with your divine powers.
Only you can reach Lanka
and find mother Sita.
I... can fly!
He has done it... he has done
it! How wonderful!
Farewell prince!
Hanuman rushes towards Lanka...
...but is challenged by the
sea monster Sindhika.
What's that?
Where am I?
I must get out of here.
Now I will cut you up
to little pieces.
After a furious battle Hanuman
tears the monster to pieces...
...and proceeds towards the
island of Lanka.
But on earth do I find Sita?
Ah... you are awake.
My day begins only when I see
the radiance of your face.
And were you... you won't
even look at me.
Do you not see I am starving
for your love?
Perhaps I should make a
gift of Ram's head.
So, you have visited
her again.
Leave her alone, my Lord.
Let's sing and dance over
there. Let's make merry.
There is only a little time left.
The promise, dear, will soon be over.
Huh! How on earth is our
lord attracted by you?
I wonder what he sees in you!?
I would like to see your husband.
I can't imagine anyone...
...more handsome than the
Lord of Lanka.
Go away all of you.
Do not annoy Sita...
...or I will have to
answer to Ravan.
O Ram! Ram, my husband...
...come to save me quickly.
O Ram!
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
I bow at your feet...
...having this great
opportunity with me.
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
O mother, I am
Ram's emissary.
The radiance of my Lord is
like the shining sun...
...and his voice is as soothing
as the moonlight.
You have been
abducted by Ravan...
...and he has called for his
own death by doing so.
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
My Lord remains deep in
thought, each moment.
But he constantly
thinks about you only.
His eyes are always longing...
...to see you, that's
my own knowledge.
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
O mother, I am the
emissary of Ram.
Come with me, mother.
I will take you back to Ram.
I can't go with you. There
are many people in Lanka...
...who have been abducted
and enslaved by force.
It's not only I who
is to be rescued.
Hmm... I understand.
I am leaving now.
But soon your beloved
husband Ram will defeat...
...Ravan and release
the people of Lanka.
Take heart, be courageous, till
the day of liberty comes.
Tell Ram to come and
save me quickly.
I will be hopeful till then.
- I will surely tell him.
Before I leave, I must teach
Ravan and his friends a lesson.
Besides, I need the exercise.
Douse the fire.
The next one promises to be
a better match for me.
Perhaps, if I let myself
to be captured...
...I will be able to see Ravan
himself, face to face.
Help! I can't stand the fire.
You there!? What is
your name and...
...who has sent you to Lanka?
O Lord of Lanka, I am Hanuman.
I come to you with respect as
a messenger of Lord Sugriv...
...the Vanara King and devoted
friend of Ram, Prince of Ayodhya.
You know it was a cowardly act
to carry off Princess Sita.
Totally contrary to Dharm.
This will surely end in
your destruction...
...and the destruction
of your race.
Restore Sita to the prince
and seek his forgiveness.
Kill him.
According to the law of kings,
you may mutilate, brand or whip...
...a messenger, but kill him?
Why? What's wrong in killing a
creature such as this?
If you slay him, what
chance is there...
...of our real enemies
being brought here?
All right, but set fire to his
tail first. Then let him go home.
Oh... it's hot. It's
burning me. Help!
It's hot... it's hot...
it's hot...
...it's hot... it's hot...
- Stop him! Stop him!
Keep moving... keep moving,
friends... move forward.
Victory awaits you!
Friends, keep moving.
With Ram's name on
the lips, move ahead, friends.
Keep moving... keep moving,
friends... move forward.
The ray of the sun
is guiding our way.
Gods believe that the demons
should be finished off.
This is a war for the truth and
removal of the sins.
The God of fire is with us,
move ahead, step-by-step.
Keep moving, step-by-step.
Keep moving... keep moving,
friends... move forward.
The race of the demons is at
the verge of ruin.
Finish off the evil with
the blows of your fists.
