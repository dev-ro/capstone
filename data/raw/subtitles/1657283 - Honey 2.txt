Right?
Uh-huh.
Don't "uh-huh" her.
What?
I know you know better.
She knows better.
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, now, Mrs. Daniels,
you do understand
that as Maria's
appointed foster parent,
you take full responsibility
of this minor?
(CHUCKLES)
Do l €V€l'.
Okay. That's it.
CONNIE: That's it?
Yes, it is. Just follow the
yellow line down to the exit.
And good lu¢l<_
Thank you.
Thank you so very much.
Thank you.
I was talking to Maria.
CONNIE:
All right, follow me.
Going to come out here,
and we are going to
put you to work.
Great.
Okay.
Let'S start
with these.
An right.
And let's set
a couple of rules.
Like what?
Like curfew at 9:00,
and you're not allowed to
hang out with your old crew.
You ain't got to
worry about that.
They ditched me
a while back.
Any more rules?
Well, not a rule,
but I would like you to start
thinking about your future,
Like, what do you
wanna do with your life?
If it was up to me...
VVl'\3ll€V€l".
It doeSr'l"[ matter.
What about your dancing?
You used to love that.
Look, I got to get a real job.
It's not like I can make any money dancing,
Excuse me? Honey built this
studio with her dance career.
We all can't be like your
daughter, Mrs, Daniels.
Well, if anybody
could be, it'd be you.
What have you...
Give me that!
This ain't no
mirror cleaning.
Now, see, your problem is,
you are not motivated,
Now, look at that. That is what a
mirror's supposed to look like.
MR. KAPOOR: No, come on.
Please, Maria.
MARIA: Oh, come on.
Maria, please. Please. What?
I don't think you working
here is a good idea.
Why? You want to heal' me num?
I don't trust you
anymore. Okay?
Mr. Kapoor, you know me.
I messed up one time.
One time!
You know what they say.
Once you go bad,
you never go back.
Wait, no. It's...
it's once you go "black,"
you never go back.
But that makes no sense.
How can you go...
Is that what
they really say?
Hmm. I'll try 10
l'€mEfT'lb€l' that.
Besides, Maria, I'm running a
business here, not a charity, okay?
I'd really like to help you,
but I just can't.
All right, maybe not.
But I can help you out.
Right?
And hows mar?
Hey!
Put it back.
Put what back?
I ain't got nothing.
Yeah?
Damn!
HOW did that
get in there?
I saw you take
the bracelet, too.
Hey! Nobody steals from Kapoor!
Big Lester, grab him!
Grab him!
(EXHALES)
Big Lester,
did you see him?
It was just her.
Oh, God.
These frigging kids.
Now, tell me, how did you
know she was stealing?
When she walked in, I just had
this feeling something was up.
Mmm. Maybe l cound

So, I go! the job?

and I wanted to see you.
Well, you saw me.

You need to

And you can keep it.
Look, I've changed.
I ain't caught up in all

I've been straight since you left.
No hustling or stealing!
I don't believe you.
Then let me

Oh, I was having

That was a joke, right?

That's how much you owe for
the stuff you tried to steal,
the mess you caused
and that bracelet.
You better

What are you going to do?
First, you need to check your tone.
This is my cousin.

I caught her shoplifting.
You did that, Tina?

Who are you going to believe?
Me or this janitor?
I'm sure
the janitor has a name.
Who are you?
Don't worry about

CARLA: Damn!

Carla, really, you got to stop

Quit it while you're behind.
Baby, stop.
Lail"I'll ever seen 8 New York
Clal'1CeF that Could turf like that.
Did you live in Cali or something?

You think you can
teach us how to do it?
Really? What happened to, "I'm
going to break your ass in halt”'?
Yeah, that was before
I saw you dance, though.
Whatever, Lyric.
We don't need her.
I think we do, Tina, because I've
never seen you get down like that.
So, you interested?
No, thanks.
Why not?
YOU'l'€ here an me time.
What you got to lose?
Is cleaning toilets
keeping you busy?
I bet she's going
Crawling back to the 718.
Girl, if I wasn't
on probation..
Ooh! What would you do?
You know what?
I'm just not interested.
Hey, what's going on?
It's the 718.
They're buying everybody slices.
When why?
They always do
stuff like that,
Last time, they handed
out school supplies.
My moms really loved that,
but I'd rather have the pizza.
YOU'l'€jUSI in time.
For whai?
What is all Of this?
What does it look like?
We take care of our own, Ma.
I mean, if not US, who will?
So, this is what you meant

MARIA: (LAUGHS) Do you remember
your cousin's wedding?
Yo, you got so lit.
I wasn'l too buzzed to
catch the bouquet, though.
Right. After you knocked over the
old lady and the flower girl.
Oh, my gosh, it was an accident!
Nobody got hurt.
The flower girl
lost a tooth, Maria.
It was already loose.
And I gave her the bouquet
to make up for it!
True. True.
Okay, then.
Oh, man. You know, after a
while, the DJ wasn't that bad.
We danced for a while
after everybody left.
It was nice, though.
I thought about
that night a lot
when I was gone.
Have you thought about
coming back to the crew?
I'm so tempted.
You know how much
dancing means to me.
Come dance with us
tomorrow.
I know once we get back at it,
it'll be just like Old times.
That's what I'm
afraid Of.
Hey, you know I got you.

I just wish you would've

Are you blaming me

Don't sweat it.

Yeah, what's that?
We get on Battle Zane

Wait, hold up.
You're trying to use us to get revenge?
That, and part of
the grand prize is that
your choreographer
gets an internship.
That'S the kind
of break I need.
Who said you were going to
take over our choreography?
BRANDON: I mean, we
could use the help.
Rigm now,
we're just winging it.
Her Stuff could
push us over the top.
Au right,
so can we get started?
No, see,
you're tripping.
AUdmOl'1S BTS if the end of the month.
Let's do this.
BRANDON;
Tina, Lyric.
Part of the grand prize
is $100,000.
I know we could
all use that money,
but with your grandma's medical
expenses, I thoug ht.,.
Why you got to
put us on blast?
No, I'm not.
Look, you know I
got your back, always.
And if you really
don't want her in,
just say the word
and I'm down.
But I think we should
do it for Grandma. I do.
And if I say no, I'm
the bad guy, right?
Pretty much.
All right,
Fine, she's in.
CARLA: Yeah!
But if she gets in my face
again, I'm going to cut her.
With what?
Your razor sharp wit?
My what?
I just said yes to you

TINA: This is So Stupid.
I'm not into it, right?
Yo, can we just stop arguing
for two seconds and focus?
How are we supposed to know what
we're doing if we can't even see?
That's the whole point.
You guys are using your eyes
and those mirrors as crutches.
You need to learn how to
trust your instincts.
Trust each other.
Think you can do il?
Just turn the damn music on already.

Wow! What is your problem?
I guess I can't
help telling the truth.

Bye,
(LAUGHS)
Don't listen to Tina.
She talks a lot of smack,
but she's a good girl.
Yeah, it's not her smack talk
that pisses me off.
I think
she might be right.
Was Tina right when
she said that you're
trying to win this thing
to get back at Luis?
Notjust Luis.
It's like, most of my life, people
told me I'd never be anything.
So, what is it
you wanted to be?
Honestly?
I want to be a dancer.
And I always have.
I think we
should go somewhere.
Okay. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
You'll see.
We're going to get cleaned up.
(MARIA GRUNTS)
Yeah.
Yeah, watch, watch.
Whoo!
How did you know
about all those places?
I'm a dance major
at NYU.
And part of our curriculum
is to experience the arts.
My head is just busting
with ideas right now.
All the stuff we could do,
like mixing the stuff we saw.
You know what I mean?
Like, if we go...
Barn! Bam! Bam!
Bam!
You know?
(CAR HONKING)
Thank you!
Do you even realize what you
do with your choreography?
It's like you're telling
this beautiful story.
What?
"Beautiful"?
Yeah, I said it.
Beautiful.
What's wrong with that? Nothing.
Just, if that's the way you step to
girls, your game is pretty weak.
You might want to take
some lessons from Darnell.
What? Are you serious? Yeah!
Darnell?
Okay, I would never
do that, first of all.
Second, I bet I do know
what impresses you.
What?
What?
What are you doing?
Yo, yo, what up, Ma?
You dig my swagger now?
Or you still fronting
like you stunting?
I'm just saying, shawty.

I just want to
make you happy.
Oh,
Now what?
Now, I want you to

Come on, guys.
We can do this.
I C3n'l believe they lei

Just ignore him.
Let's see.
HD Crew, right?
You're out of
the Honey Daniels Center.
IS that what
the HD stands for?
No.
No, it stands for "High Def."
Like, clear.
In your face.
JONAS: Well, Honey
Daniels is amazing.
Y'all have got some
big, big shoes to fill.
I could tell you righi now,
you're just wasting your time.
JONAS; What, you
know them, Luis?
LUIS: Just her.
She couldn't quite
cut it with our crew,
SO l cut her IOOS€.
Why you got to lie?
Yo, can we get this
audition going, or what?
(LAUGHS)
Yes, you can.
I do love
the drama, though.
Lei'S do it!
All right.
Come on, y'all.
I'm going to
show you.
(GIRL SINGING)
(HIP HOP BEATS)
(ALL LAUGHING)
Thank you,
but it's a "no," kids.
KATRINA: Sorry.
Maybe next year.
You guys are wack.
(LAUGHING)
I tried to Yell you, Maria,
You're just not good enough.
And those two new dancers ain't
going to save you either.
Now, beat it.
MAN: Get out of here. Get out.
Beat it!
NO!
NO,
Sweetie, don't make this
difficult on yourself.
We're doing it again.
JONAS:
Well, well, well.
Now, this just got
more interesting.
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(PANNNG)
Listen, we've decided
that because of your dancing
and the obvious tension between
you and my boy Luis here,
that this Should make
for great television.
HD, welcome to
the Battle Zone.
(ALL SCREAM JOYOUSLY)
Thank you.
Thank you.
We did it.
That was insane.
It was nuts.
Not just the way
we made the show,
but the way you
stood up to those judges.
I mean, you were like, "Hell no!
Y'all are going to check us out!"
Okay, I just wanted our crew
to have a fair shot.
I give you
mad props for that.
We finally feel like
a real crew, you know?
And that wouldn't have
happened if it wasn't for you.
I respect that.
You're welcome.
You can take that one to them.
I'll get the other one.
Okay.
Make them save me
a slice, though,
I will.
I'm in.
So, where's Brandon at?
I texted him.
He must still be taking his finals.
Finals? He could've skipped
those to come celebrate, man.
You don't skip finals, bro.
That's why they call them finals,
The boy is trying to
get his edu-macation on.
That don't make him any
different than the rest of us.
We all just want to
dance for a living.
Yeah, but we don't all have
filthy rich parents like he does.
What are you
talking about?
His family owns
half Of Texas.
You didn't know?
His family makes the Hiltons
look like the Hammers.
(LAUGHING)
Can't touch this.
Really_ Really?
He's good
with kids, too.
He te8Cl'1€S 3 ClaSS
with kids?
Yeah. Once a week.
You didn't know
that either?
What do you know?
Let me ask you
a serious question.
Do y'all actually ever talk or just bone?
She just be like...
Shake it, baby!
Yo, Carla.
Check it out.
CARLAI Oh, uh-uh.
She is about to be
sleeping with the enemy.
Good stuff today.
Thank you.
Watching you move
was amazing.
Stop it.
Hey, I'm serious.
Tina, is he
bothering you?
No, he was just telling me how
much he liked our audition.
No, I said I like
your audition.
You're the one who brings
the heat to this group.
Tina, did he tell you that
you're too good for us
and that you should be
dancing with his crew?
Yeah, he did, but...
Tina, he's trying
to play you.
Hey, calm down.
I told him I would stay with the HDS.
Wen, good.
But you act like I ain't even
good enough to dance with them.
I diunw say mar.
Sounds like that's
what she's saying to me.
MARIA: You know what?
Stop starting trouble.
Leave our crew alone.
Tina, are you going to
let her dis you like that?
I mean, I know if someone
in my crew called me out,
we'd battle on the spot.
Wow! I am not calling her out.
And if we're going to battle,
we're going to do it as a crew
and take your sorry ass out.
And what's stopping you?
What's stopping you?
(LAUGHS MOCKINGLY)
See that, Tina?
She's scared.
She's scared!
If you were on the 718, baby,
you wouldn't run from nothing.
Whatever.
Maria, we got to
do this, okay?
We're finally getting some props,
and it's time to back it up.
Tina, are YOU sure?
Yeah, I'm as sure as you
were in that audition.
That's pretty sure.
Tina's right. If we aren't going to
knock heads, we got to do something.
Hen, yeah!
That's what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Mmm?
Fine.
Lel'$ battle.
YGS,
Let's go.
LYRIC: Yeah, they

You call this a crew?
Are you serious?
And you actually think you're going
to take us out on Battle Zone?
(scoFFs)
Toys.
Tina, when you're
ready to grow up,
come holler at your boy.
Yo, I was wrong.
We ain't no damn crew.
We're just some posers.
Tina, we tried...
But our try wasn't good enough,
ain't never good enough!
We got humiliated!
Nobody is going to
respect us after this.
Nobody!
Wait, Tina!
Leave me alone!
Tina!
Tina!
(CROWD JEERING)
YOU'l'S IE\€.
Do I have to remind you
what time your curfew is?
I know what time
my curfew is,
You know what?
We made rules
in this house,
and they are going to
have to be followed.
Or what? You're going to
send me back to juvie? Fine.
What is the matter
with you?
I'm just sick of trying.
I try and live by your rules.
I try and stay
out of trouble.
I try and join
a new crew.
And nothing works.
Well, it doesn't mean
you have to give up.
Save it.
I'm going to bed.
Hey,
Where you been?
Sorry I'm late.
I didn't get much
sleep last night.
What's going on?
Tina quit. She said
she's not coming back.
What the hell?
Do you know what this
does to our choreography?
Of course we do!
But I'm...
Bun nothing!
This screws everything up!
Don't take it out
on Lyric.
I'm not taking it out
on Lyric. I'm pissed!
So, what do we do?
You tell us.
You're the choreographer.
You know what?
I don't need this
right now.
I'm out.
Weil, that's messed up.
What?
A Sf feel bafue?
What were you thinking?
Didn't you know losing
would ruin their confidence?
I'm sorry, college boy, I'm not as smart as you.
I didn'1 know that
Well, you should have.
And you should have told me
you were just some rich kid
slumming it down
here for grades.
Now, what does my family's money
have to do with any of this?
Makes ii all
just a game for you.
If things fall apart,
you can just leave,
buf the FSSI Of US SFS StUCk
h€l'S to deal with ii.
In case you haven't
noticed, I'm Still here.
You're the one
that walked out.
Because i'l['S over!
l quit!
We can't win
without Tina!
Fine, If that's the way you
feel, then you should quit.
I'm going to go up there with my
crew, because I believe in us.
Mafia.
Are you okay?
Yeah. why?
Today's your day off.
What can I say?
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.
Oh, Maria.
Let'S talk.
Let's talk.
You got to follow
your heart, Maria.
Is there a problem at home
or with your friends?
Both.
And this is how you deal with it?
Come to work?
Yeah.
Huh. Good.
Why, because you get
free labor?
Of course.
But I was
thinking, Maria,
instead of getting
yourself into trouble,
you chose to do
something constructive.
I like that.
Well, while I'r'r'l
being constructive,
is there anything else
you want me to do?
You go work your register, and
I'll take care of this later,
You said no one works
the register but you,
What, you expect me to take your word
for it that you were going to change?
NO,
I had to wait for you to
prove it, and you have.
So, now I trust you.
Thanks, Mr. Kapoor.
That means a lot.
BRANDON:
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
Try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.
An right.
So, you're back now?
Why new
I still got to do my community
service here anyway.
Right.
Hey,
Hey, nook.
I want to be here,
if that's okay with you.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.
Yo, is that Tina?
Okay, I'm just going to
go ahead and say it,
Shit!
She joined up
with the 718.
That's scandalous, man.
How's she going to play us like that?
Because she only thinks about
her damn self, that's how.
BRANDON: We can't sweat
this right now, guys,
MARIA: He's right.
We need to focus 0l'1 \l'1iS CFGW.
So, let's rock this thing,
all right? Bring it in.
Let's get an HD on three,
an right?
One, two, three...
ALL: HD!
MARIO!
Every S€3S0f1 OD BB"/G ZOITS,
we find Ihe hottest, IT'loS\
il'lS3I'l€ CTGWS OH the SCSIIG,
and last season
was no different.
The 718 set this place on fire
with their off-the-chain routines,
and at the end
of this season,
you're going to
see them perform
against
the last crew standing.
There's already been some
behind-the-scenes madness
with one crew jacking
another for a dancer,
and we haven't
even started yet.
So, what's
jumping off next?
Stay tuned, because you don't
want to miss Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
One of these crews
is going home tonight.
Judges, who will it be?
Well, it's obvious that this
year's talent is amazing,
but, unfortunately,
somebody has to go.
And rumgnr,
it's Fanny Pak.
(SCREAMS JOYOUSLY)
Sorry, guys.
ALL; (DRAMATICALLY)
Ah! Ah,
I'm sorry to see those guys go.
They were a hot crew.
Yeah, but they
weren't the best.
And you have
got to be the best
if you're gonna go
up against the 71 8.
MARIO: Enough said.
We'll see you next
week in Battle Zone.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
Come on,
we just killed it!
Yeah, we're still in.
WE I'1S€d\0 Ialk.
No, we don't.
Look, I know you think you know
what you're doing, but you don't.
You need to stay
away from Luis.
He said you were going to
say something like that.
Trying to get me
back in the crew?
Look, he's right, we need you.
But more importantly,
I don't want to see
you get caught up.
You don't know him
like I do.
I know he's my best chance
at winning that prize money.
Can you
guarantee me that?
Yeah, I didn't
think 50,
Wait.
For what?
I ain't coming
back to your crew.
Then, just be careful.
Can I talk to you
for a second?
What do you want?
Lrll only rake
E SECOHU.
Come on.
Whats up?
Let me take Tina's place.
Right.
I mean it.
I'll come dance with you if
you kick Tina off your crew.
What changed your mind
all Of a Sudden?
I know what I'm getting into with you.
Tina doesn't.
And since when did you become
a teenage crisis counselor?
You know I'm
a better dancer than her,
and I can pretty much
guarantee you another win.
That's true.
There's just one little problem.
\Nhat'S that?
Come here.
Come close.
I don't
trust you, witch.
Ever since you got out ofjuvie,
you've been full of yourself
and treating me like I'm something
you scraped off your shoe.
But,
you see that
little girl over there?
She has stars
in her eyes.
And I can make her
do anything I want.
You're a jerk.
Do you know that?
You used to like it.
You tried to fix it,
didn't you?
You were listening?
I had to make sure
you were okay.
Yeah, I'm good.
Ijusi feel bad.
Tina being with them
is all my fault.
NO,
Til'1a'S SIUbbol'fl.
That's her faull.
But thanks for
trying to protect her.
I just want the crew to go back
to the way it was, you know?
I do, too.
Hey, do me a favor.
Don't be mad at me anymore,
because I'm too tired to fight.
N19 too.
BRANDON: Yeah, the movie
was good, but real talk,
could you stop killing
us in rehearsals?
No, I have to.
We've got to make it
to the finals.
We got to be
strong enough to win.
You can hang, can't
you, college boy?
Oh, I can hang.
Okay, then.
So, say my name.
College boy?
Okay, say it.
(LAUGHS) Okay, okay! Brandon!
"Brandon," all right?
Are you happy now?
Very h3PPY-
(GIRL SOBBING)
Do you hear that?
Yeah.
Just wait rig hi here.
Maria, come here.
Tina, are you okay?
MARIA; Hey, what happened?
Did Luis do this
to you?
No, it was his boys.
They beat you up?
No.
Luis told them
to walk me home,
and then they smashed a store
window and told me to grab stuff.
And did you?
I WGS 100 SC3l'€d.
There was glass everywhere.
I got all cut up.
I'll take her to my house.
It's okay there.
Okay.
Come on.
Come on.
I should've listened to you when you
told me to stay away from Luis.
Yeah, well, sometimes you just
got to learn the hard way.
Yeah, you're right.
So, what are you
going to do now?
I'm not messing with Luis no more.
That's for damn sure.
Word.
VVl"liCl"l ITTSSFIS l C3l"I'll
dal'1C€ with his Crew either.
Right.
You 'think I could
COITIG back to the HDS?
You know that's
not how it works.
Yeah. Hey! Owl
Are you an right?
Yeah.
MARIA: All right.
You guys already
know my vote.
I say we let Tina
back in the crew.
That would be
my vote, too,
MARIA: All right.
Ricky?
Well,
Tina's my homegirl, so,
yeah.
I want her back.
All right. Carla?
Girl, I'm easy.
Ha! We know that.
You don'\!
Anyways, my vote is yes.
Not because I think
you deserve it, Tina,
but because l CENT
Sfind l.UiS and hiS CFSW.
An right.
Well, Tina's crazy.
And you know what they say,
crazy ass is the best ass.
And the best ass
is some crazy ass!
Then that must be
my ass.
HEY, QUYS,
not the rig ht time.
Okay.
Yeah. Lyric,
it's on you.
Carla was right,
you don't deserve it.
Every single one
of us had your back.
You basically spit in our faces.
That was messed up.
Ldidl'1'\ ITISEH ION.
I don't care
what you meant.
I only care
about what you did.
We were like sisters, Tina.
I would've done anything for you.
Then you leave me, and now you want
to come back like we're all cool?
I'm sorry.
I messed up.
YOU messed Up bad.
You're still family,
and I'll always love you.
But if you want my trust,
you got to earn it,
Just tell me how.
I'll do it.
You can start by getting
back in this crew,
and help us
whoop Luis' ass.
I might need a tissue.
(SOBBING) Damn, I think my
allergies kicking in or something.
I thought someone was
chopping onions up in here,
(SOBBING)
(HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING)
Besides 718, who else
we got to look out for?
That's hard to say.
I mean, some of the best crews
from last year will be back.
If.'$ I'1Oll fol' the Weak.
(AUDIENCE BOOING)
(LOUD CHEERING)
We're going to need
your toughness, Tina.
YOU mean thal?
You think I'd give you a
compliment if I didn'1 mean ii?
Aw!
Aw!
All right. Okay!
Get off me!
Th3i'S the bUSif\€SS.
You guys, come on.
You got to loosen up.
Those other crews will

especially the 71 8.
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
MARIO!
Join US fl6Xf week,
because you don? want to miss the
semifinals on Dance Battle Zone.
(ALL WHOOPING)
There was this girl when
I was in juvie, Julissa,
and every time
we would battle,
she'd always come up
with something new,
What was she in for?
She tried to
kill her stepdad.
Whoa. why?
She didn't say,
but we all knew.
Was it scary in there?
Not in a way you
could really imagine
or I could really
describe to you.
It's like feeling alone with
hundreds of people around you.
What did they
charge you with?
Breaking and entering.
Luis thought he knew his way
in and out of a pawn shop.
What he didn't know was sometimes
the owner liked to stay late.
Luis heard 3 noise,
Fan OUT
and left me to deal with a man with
the biggest gun I'd ever seen,
pointed right in my face.
How did you get hooked up with
that guy in the first place?
He used to
COFTIG to the C€I'Tll€F.
He gave me attention.
Ldidrl"t really have 8 lot
of that SS 3 foster Kid.
What happened to
your parents?
They died in 3 Cal' crash.
I was 10.
Shit-
Can we talk about something else?
No disrespect, but,..
An right.
Yeah, lerslake 3 break.
I just need 10
get outside.
Let's go eat.
You all not coming?
We're going to
stay back.
Don't do anything
I wouldn'\ do!
What exactly
wouldn't you do?
Him.
You see, that's messed up.
I didn't even say nothing,
Why you got to
come at me like that?
You're asking for it
all the time!
God!
I asked you to stay
so we could talk.
I mean, there's still a lot
I don't know about you.
What do you
want to know?
Well,
fOr St3l'l6fS,
a dance and
business major?
Whal'S ihal about?
My father is the one that's
pressing me into finance.
He just doesn't think that there's
a future for me in dance.
But the way I look at it is,
if we win Battle Zone,
I could go on tour for a year
just doing what I love.
And I can go back to school
with no regrets.
And it'S like I gave it that shot.
You know what I mean?
I know.
I know what it's like to have
people not believe in you,
Is that why you
want to win so bad?
It's not even
about that, really.
I mean, the people
that really count,
Mrs. Daniels.
You.
I mean, they've always had my
back, even when I didn't see it.
And whether we win or lose,
I'm going to keep dancing.
It's how I say the
things I want to say.

Yeah.

Come here.
RICKY: Hey, if we lose, we lose.
