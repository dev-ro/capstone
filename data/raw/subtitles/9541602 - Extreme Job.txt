Target position secured.
Unit 2 on roof. Device set.
Unit 2, get in position.
Ready to rappel down.
Block all passages.
Go on my signal.
Personal safety is priority.
3…
2…
1…
Go!
You dope head.
When you gonna kick that shit?
I had bloodwork done, dumb-ass.
If you got health problems,
eat cabbage.
Don't shoot up.
Secondhand smoke ruined my health.
Open a damn window.
Gambling doesn't kill gamblers.
Lung cancer does.
That fan over there?
Ever thought to use it?
Aw, shit…
What the… Dammit…
What was that?
What the hell…
Who is it?
Just… hold on.
One second.
No cleaning kit.
So not a window cleaner.
You a cop?
Good job.
You get a sticker.
This is ridiculous.
Is busting a card game
worth all this fuss?
You're sweet.
I won't arrest you.
The rest of you, hands up!
I'm here for the dope head.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.
Let's go, Hwan-dong.
Almost dinner time.
Where you going?
You gonna run?
I don't want dinner.
You know I'm on diet.
I already ate.
We got all escape routes covered.
Guess who's behind door number 2?
For crying out loud...
he's not gonna come this way.
This is exciting. My first arrest!
That means this
window's covered too?
Well, well.
Wait… where you going?
How do you stop this thing?
You partner with her?
Grab my hand!
This is pathetic.
If you rappel down,
you gotta make a clean jump,
break through the window,
roll here,
pull your baton,
and tackle your target
without taking any hits.
Then subdue the target,
slap on cuffs,
and read them their rights.
Isn't that how it goes?
Our policy is to
minimize property damage.
I feel sorry for the cops in this
country. Where's the dignity?
People before money.
That your bumper?
Yep.
You watch too many movies.
It doesn't work.
Really?
Go!
The suspect's getting away!
After him!
He was right! Shit!
Captain Ko!
Go! Just go!
Hey! Stop!
You!
What the hell?
You piece of shit!
Hey! Stop!
Son of a bitch!
Perfect timing.
If you can't run fast enough,
find a fast ride.
You really should use
your brain once in a while.
I know it hurts.
Cuffs will make you feel better.
Now, where'd they go?
Throw me your cuffs.
Shit!
You caught a middle man
then nearly killed him.
Why didn't you just kill him?
You worried about breaking windows
but smashed up 16 cars.
That last car crashed deliberately.
It's true.
It already had a dented bumper.
I saw it.
- Shut up.
- Total insurance fraud.
Whatta lowlife!
I said shut up.
It was only 15 cars.
Did you get CCTV?
I'll get that fraudster.
Shut up. Shut the hell up.
Let them ramble. It's funny.
Sorry, sir.
Oh, look at this.
You made a social media star.
Watch.
“Mrs. Kim” will now be synonymous
with “courageous civilian”
instead of “terrible driver”.
That's incredible.
Think so?
I admire the optimism.
Captain Ko.
Sir?
Aren't you tired of being captain?
I know I am.
Did you hear Choi
got his promotion?
But he's junior to our captain!
Shut your mouth.
While you were dangling from a rope
trying to catch small fish,
Choi and his Organized Crime Unit
reeled in evidence
for a major drug trafficking deal.
They even apprehended an entire
syndicate after 2 months undercover,
confiscating 2 kilograms of meth
and doing your job for you.
So where does that leave you?
Maybe you picked the wrong career…
or maybe I should do
the thinking for you,
you hopeless bunch of imbeciles!
With all due respect...
Get out!
Go!
Out!
- Disappear!
- No need for violence.
Out! Out!
- Have a good day, sir.
- Get the hell out!
I swear I'm gonna quit but,
every morning I come in here.
Maybe I come to work to swear.
What's the point of working so hard
if we can't even eat properly?
And why is that?
Because you disappeared
with the squad budget.
I didn't disappear,
I went undercover.
Pisses me off even
thinking about it.
I'll give you a piece of my
mind, you thief!
Knock it off.
I'll handle the budget
from now on.
- Frisk him.
- Got it.
I said knock it off.
- Get your hands off me.
- Sorry, sir.
Huh?
It's a chip.
A what?
A chip?
A chip.
What chip?
Choco chip.
Choco chip?
Yeah, choco chip.
Swallow.
Go on, do it.
I went undercover in a casino.
I had to blend in.
This isn't important.
About that fraudster…
You bastard…
We're short on money as it is!
Let go! I'll kill him!
Stop. Let him go.
Let go of me.
Get your hands off me.
Captain!
- You talking to me?
- Who else is here?
You should've told me
if you knew 2 months ago.
We could've collaborated.
Why didn't you say anything?
I wanted to catch them.
What?
I wanted to catch them myself.
You have a knack for
screwing up operations.
Remember the Chang case?
I said give it a month, but
you couldn't resist poking around.
I heard a transit bus
caught your perp today.
It was a village bus!
Better than a school bus.
We're outta here.
By the way, there's only one
captain here. I got promoted.
Aren't you gonna congratulate me?
Come join us for dinner.
We're having barbecue.
Keep it together.
Why don't you just eat it raw?
I like it rare.
Leave him alone.
The closest he's come to beef
is beef-flavored ramen.
Not a good flavor.
Do you have any self-respect?
Nope. This is awesome.
Try it.
Yes, ma'am.
Can we get a bottle of Jinro?
The $30 one?
More garlic too!
Keep your chin up.
Hurts my neck.
I wanna give you a tip, me to you.
If you catch Mubae,
you'll hit it out of the park.
It won't get me anywhere.
Don't you want your promotion?
Shit…
Mubae's right hand man, Hong,
was released 6 months ago.
What was he in for?
Thuggery.
What's he gonna do now?
Thuggery.
Yep. And what did
he learn from Mubae?
Life lessons?
Dope trading.
Bingo.
You'd think he'd go back
to his turf, clean it up,
leave a few bodies in his wake.
Believe me, I know.
Get to the point.
After cleaning up his turf,
surprisingly…
he hasn't done a thing.
Should I be disappointed?
Listen…
he's recruited new faces.
Pushers and ex-cons.
He's putting together a gang.
What're they up to?
My gut says they're waiting
for Mubae's return to Korea.
Why are you telling me this?
Offering you a break
one bro to another.
My hands are full right now.
Narc picks up Mubae.
We'll take Hong.
This is just between us.
Why? Lil bro is hurting your pride?
Then forget it.
You're not my bro.
You're a superior officer now.
You're not gonna tell him
he doesn't have to do that?
He's excited.
I'm not gonna ruin it for him.
Let him have some newbie fun.
We'll lay low 'til Mubae surfaces.
Tell that to Ma.
He goes around looking for trouble.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let me come!
Can I come, too?
Hurry! We're running late.
Take a seat.
Let's go!
Our newbie's gonna
build a house today.
They're quiet as a grave.
There's no telling
when Mubae will show.
Why don't we just go in?
I still have the gas man uniform.
I'll go in with Young-ho.
I wanted to stop doing that.
They don't know us yet.
This is our best chance.
Huh?
I'm asking you for ID.
Well, we're actually…
p-I-e-e-s...
Sorry? Say that again?
We're from Mapo.
Okay, sir. You live in Mapo.
But I need your ID,
not your address.
Oh, come on!
Why the hell would
we stalk this lady?
Then why were you
watching me in secret?
With all due respect,
I'm not that low.
Stay back, please.
You look exactly that low!
Creeps me out.
Say what?
I hate it when people
comment on my looks!
I'll say what I see!
Please, ma'am.
Calm down. Please.
You. Are. A. Stalker.
Okay, let's go.
Teach them a lesson!
We're surveying
the neighborhood for viability.
And you accuse us of stalking you?
Come on, let's just go.
On our way to the station.
Stop.
KNPA
Brother Chicken.
Did you order more?
Man…
I wish this chicken was the perp.
We've had tons of this.
Can we order something hot?
I'm about to throw up.
Can we get some hot sauce?
Why do we always pay for this
but of our own pockets?
Because of you.
You spent all our money.
Makes me wanna smash your skull.
Can I ask you something?
Don't.
Do you have a crush on me?
Yes. I am head over heels
in love with you, idiot!
Captain, this is pointless.
Ma blew his cover
by stalking that lady,
and besides,
staking out here is unproductive.
We don't know when Mubae will...
There he is!
That's him, right?
He's that good-looking?
Must have had a makeover.
Get down.
Dammit…
What are you doing?
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Shit…
What a curious bunch.
Here. This is on the house.
On the house? Why?
Because I feel like it.
And you look happy.
Shit!
We've got no time to waste.
We're switching to wiretap.
Not without a warrant.
This isn't an anti-communist op.
Choi and his Organized Crime Unit
aren't getting this case.
Illegally obtained evidence
won't hold in court.
We need approval from Chief.
Forget it.
He doesn't have our back.
If only for internal confirmation.
No one will know.
Captain,
tread carefully or
you could lose your pension.
Without it, we're no better
than part-time cashiers.
Lose our pension or lose our jobs.
I'll take full responsibility.
Get the wiretap.
So cool.
External wiretapping is
made to order and takes time.
I can get cams right away.
How are we gonna get through
that metal door?
Duck.
Sir, do you deliver?
What chicken joint doesn't?
Do you deliver to that building?
Do I deliver there?
It's the only place
I get orders from.
We're in!
Excuse me.
Can we deliver for you?
No wonder you've been
on job sites all day.
You're looking for a new job.
I'm sorry, but
I put this place up for sale.
Today's my last day.
What?
- You can't.
- Why not?
You're asking me?
You're the only customers
I've had all week.
Why else would I give you
free chicken?
We'll buy it.
Ow!
What the hell?
You can't buy the store..
It's not as absurd as it sounds.
What? You wanna sell
chicken to pass time?
He said they're his only customers.
Have you seen anyone walk in
while we were here?
No.
How are we gonna buy it?
I'll put in a request.
Think they'll approve?
Hell no.
Then shut up.
I'm washing up.
Decide who's on night watch.
We need solid evidence
to pin Mubae.
It's absurd to lose him over money.
There's a lot of absurdity
in what we do.
Special Crime's Captain Lee
will be promoted soon.
Another one?
Where does that leave our captain?
Years from retirement
with no place to stand.
I'll buy the business.
I've been saving for my wedding,
but for the captain's sake,
I'll get married in the next life.
Forgive me, mother!
I'm not married yet either.
Don't lose hope.
Let us pray.
Dear Lord…
Our newbie, Jae-hoon…
Fix me some supper.
Gucci…
Chicken….
What?
It's fine.
I can do it.
Captain Choi's wife called.
We used to hang out a lot.
She wants to treat me to lunch.
Should I treat her like
your boss' wife from now on?
Even the community sup
gets promoted after a while.
I don't go to the new supermarket
because it's called “Captain Mart”.
I change the channel
when Chief Inspector is on
because he's been playing
captain for 20 years.
Captain, captain, captain…
I can't stand the word!
Mom, they made me student captain!
Don't do it! Don't do it!
No! No! No!
Is it good?
Fried chicken's always good.
My teacher calls chicken
common people food.
I hope the price doesn't go up
so we can still get it.
Hey, dad can afford that much.
Have some then.
Nah, I'll pass.
Is work tough?
Only because I'm not capable.
You can't be a captain
if you're not capable.
It takes more than hard work
to be a captain.
More than anything,
you need money.
Money for what?
You gotta treat people
from time to time.
And if we're short on money,
I gotta chip in.
30 bucks? Really?
Have you heard of
the anti-graft law?
Civil servants cannot exchange
more than $30 at a time.
You think I'm made of money?
How can I back a squad
that produces no results?
But you can't send me to admin.
The captain of that
team is Ma's peer.
I'll transfer both of you.
That's even worse.
And that changes what?
Chief, you put this team together.
Now I'm disbanding it myself.
Sir… What?
You know me.
I honestly don't
know if I do anymore.
It's not like my
chicken isn't tasty.
It's gotta be bad karma.
You've fried your share
of chicken. Just let it go.
Maybe I'll try selling
plants or trees.
Where do I sign?
What's the matter with you?
Mr. Kim, give us a few days.
We'll take over.
With what money?
I'm selling cheap, and you jobless
bums still can't afford it.
We're not bums!
We're...
You're… what?
Huh?
- Brothers and sisters.
- Brothers-in-law.
What are you saying?
That's right.
These two are brothers,
and these two are married.
I see.
We want to run it as a family.
Help us out.
You should at least
put down a deposit.
You can't just badger.
It's good if a family
works together.
You're right. I'm her husband.
Huh?!
What?
She said she's married to that guy.
I meant ex.
How American.
Uh-huh.
Like in those Hollywood movies.
Exactly.
Wow.
Okay, well…
Yes.
- See you later.
- Yeah, sure.
- Bye.
- Take care.
Thank you.
You okay? Using your
retirement fund for this?
If we don't catch Mubae, I gotta quit
and open a chicken joint anyway.
I'll just say I started early.
My ex rocks!
No one goes home after today.
Young-ho?
We're closed for reopening.
Come in, come in.
I thought there were no customers!
We had 9 tables... 13.
13 damn tables! And not
the ones we're waiting for!
Maybe it's beginner's luck.
Who's frying the chicken?
Because people are gonna order it.
Don't be retarded.
We'll order from somewhere else.
Ahhh...
We don't know how long
we'll need to do this
but we can't keep
turning customers way.
Our cover will be blown for sure.
Let's just sell chicken.
Shut up.
I'd better, right?
Why are they so damn quiet?
Anything recorded today?
Just tons of guzzling and TV.
They got it easy.
Did they go anywhere?
To the supermarket.
What did they get?
Chicken breasts.
Are they trying to be
healthy dope heads?
Motherfucker!
Lock the door.
The boss said don't make trouble.
Why you getting all worked up?
You in love with me or something?
Didn't we decide we'll have
the remote on odd days?
And we'll have it on even.
Then watch YouTube or some shit
instead of flipping
channels on my day.
It was a commercial.
I wanted to see what else was on.
Yeah, but it starts
small then gets bigger.
Think we don't know that?
What did you say?
You want a pretty
smile for your face?
You begging for a Chelsea Grin?
They're good with words.
You're obviously blind. How
about I give you a Lasik surgery?
- Pretty entertaining.
- Scrape out your eyes with a spork.
How do you talk sense to a junkie?
We're narcos, you fucking thug!
Narcs, you lousy scum!
You poison society to
take home 6 figures and fancy cars.
Because we live in a world
where skills are valued.
Wanna see the skills
I got with my blade?
You syndicate types
pretend it's all about honor,
but you take thousands
in hazard pay.
Thousands?
We don't make near that.
What are you doing?
Bringing them in.
For what?
For…
slander?
Against who?
Our profession?
You'll fine them for that?
Why'd they go quiet?
Was it so hard
to keep your mouths shut?
- It's Hong.
- That's him.
Tired of watching TV?
Of voting for your
favorite contestant?
Stick your heads out.
This'll take all day.
Hit yourselves 'til
you get at least 2 cuts.
Seems rational.
Enough. Warmed up yet?
Back in the day, we had
fist fights to rank ourselves.
Remember?
Let's see who's number 1 now.
Take off your shirts.
Ready…
go!
They're at it again.
Their punches are really loud.
Playground fighting is louder.
Come on, Hong. Commentate.
Stop.
Who won? Which side?
Narcs! Narcs! Narcs! Narcs!
Are you ready to hear the winner?
The Narcs!
We won!
- Losers buy chicken.
- Yes, sir.
Unlatch the door.
Get some take-out.
Shit! Lock the door.
Turn off the lights.
Damn.
Are you the new owners?
You can't leave your
trash out front.
Omigod!
It's you people again.
9, 1, 1
Hello?
Wait, wait!
We took over this restaurant.
That's why you've
been lurking around.
I totally misunderstood.
I'll buy some chicken,
as a gesture of goodwill.
Bring me your best.
Well…
we don't have chicken… yet.
No chicken in a chicken restaurant?
Unfortunately, no.
We just opened so…
The boys from upstairs
have come for chicken too.
They have no chicken today.
What a shame.
Here.
Who's doing the frying?
Come on, are you serious?
I said come back and
they said they'd come back.
He meant it too.
There's no point
if they're getting take out.
We can forget the garnish,
then take it later,
enter the venue,
and recon the inside.
Or we could deliver free chicken.
He's right.
We can treat them.
Ma, start frying.
You're from Suwon,
the birthplace of fried chicken.
It's actually the
birthplace of ribs.
Ma's folks run a rib
restaurant in Suwon.
You know nothing.
Then you do it, Jang.
- Yes.
- Really?
Yeah.
Do you remember the stew she made?
The one that tasted like poop?
I remember. I can't forget.
Then you do it.
I'm a surveillance specialist.
I'm from a patriarchal family.
I've never even been in a kitchen.
I'll marry in my next life...
Screw you.
Alright. Everyone does it!
Go! Fry!
But I really...
I don't care. Get in the kitchen.
That doesn't even look cooked.
What the hell?
Did you do this on purpose?
Urgh.
Why's this good?
Whose is this?
Mine.
Notta chance.
No shit.
You're insane.
Succulent.
Alright! The verdict is in.
Congratulations, Ma.
Give it your best.
Wait.
Give it my best?
For what?
Are you open?
It was perfect.
Just do the same again.
Can we get sticky chicken?
With sticky sauce?
I forgot there are
two types of fried chicken.
The only sauce I know is marinade
for ribs, our family recipe.
That'll do. Get on it.
Interesting seasoning.
What's this chicken called?
It's called…
Suwon rib marinade chicken.
Suwon rib marinade chicken?
Oh god!
Wow!
This is so good.
This has become my favorite place.
- So yummy.
- Let's get a picture.
We got it. We got it.
Alright! Nailed it.
Okay.
- #SuwonRibMarinadeChicken
- Ready… say chicken.
Chicken!
Can we get a soju?
Yes.
Okay.
What?
One half-and-half.
Jae-hoon.
Coming right up.
Two people?
Come on in.
Choosing good failure
over inglorious success
would be an honorable thing,
but honey, I'm not ashamed.
You went through a lot for me.
Now, let your hair down and enjoy.
We'll go to nice places.
We'll live a little.
Because you deserve it.
Chicken is the future.
Suwon rib marinade chicken.
Jae-hoon. Jae-hoon?
Can you get radish and salt?
I gotta mince garlic after this.
You should've done that earlier.
This is so not professional.
Actually, my real job is...
What?!
- Check, please.
- Yes.
Just a moment.
It's $88.
Out of 90…
- $2 is your change. Thank you.
- Thank you.
Can I get a Coke?
Coming right up.
Young-ho, come inside
and get radish and salt.
Can I get some dinner?
Wow, Gucci... agh!
What's that?
You said you wanted one.
But it's too expensive.
I got a bonus at work.
Give me a second.
Let me take a quick shower.
Honey?
What do you mean by that?
Why are you taking a shower?
We're not some crooked show.
We don't ask for money.
We don't hire fake customers.
It's 100% real.
So you want our restaurant
to be on your show?
Not just the restaurant,
but you, your wife,
and the chef…
We're gonna put everyone
on national TV.
There's a step!
Don't push!
Good bye.
We have high ratings.
We'll do you good, I promise.
He humiliated me.
A national TV producer!
What a shame.
My folks ran their restaurant
for 30 years and were never on TV.
We can't be on TV.
We're undercover cops.
We can ask them to
blur out our faces.
What?!
Come to think of it…
What the hell?!
Get your act together!
Are we here to fry chicken?
Did you forget who you really are
while cooking and wiping tables?
Let's turn in our resignation
and do this for real, dumbasses.
Chicken never tasted so good.
Is this really chicken?
Thank you for calling
Suwon Rib Marinade Chicken.
A group of 30? … Certainly.
Thank you.
I get diarrhea just thinking
about chicken now. Geez…
What the…?
Dammit.
Possible C-1 sighting.
Possible C-1 sighting.
Hello?
Excuse me?
Coming.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Excuse me?
Hello?
Shit…
Yeah.
Pick up the damn phone.
Mubae!
What the…?
Huh?
Dammit.
Hey!
What the fuck is wrong with
you, man?!
Get out of the car!
I'm sorry, okay?
Where have you been all day?
I could've used some
help with the beer.
There are those who slack off
while others work their asses off.
Are you calling me a slacker?
Why didn't you answer the radio?
Or my call?!
It was pure madness!
I'm sitting down for
the first time today.
Are you doing this as a cover
or are you using undercover
as an excuse?
Calm down, man.
Are you drunk?
Mubae was here.
What?
Mubae?
What happened?
I chased him. By myself.
In that shitty little car of ours.
Then...
I came to an intersection.
Which way did he go?
Left or right? North or south?
Do you know how frustrated I felt?
Do you?
The eternal dilemma
of fried or sticky chicken.
What happened?
What do you think?
I lost him.
And you're proud of that?
You're not the only one
who had a tough day.
I got burned and cut.
Do you know how much that hurts?
A lot! Still very hurts.
Instead of chopping down criminals,
I'm chopping chicken all day!
Who here has peeled
4 sacks of onions,
15kg of garlic,
and 33 bundles of green onions?
Every day is drilling.
$2,340.
That's today's sales.
Suppose each table is $30.
Do you know how many tables
I served and wiped today?
Jesus…
That's my point.
We're not doing this to make money.
Why give it your best?
Why is business flourishing?
Damn this chicken!
How many times did I tell you
to recruit a middleman?
Ted Chang is going around
threatening everyone.
I'm threatening you now,
in case you weren't aware.
I'm sorry,
but I found a guy I can trust.
Unfortunately,
he was doing a one-off job
and got hit by a bus.
I almost laughed there.
The one guy you can trust
had to do a side job to survive.
Like I said,
it's because of Chang...
Chang, Chang, Chang!
You're having fun, aren't you?
Come here.
Let's make it fun for me too.
Hong.
I told you not to carry that around.
It's unsightly.
Because of Chang…
Chang's the reason?
Gimme that.
Hong.
Sir?
Get me some wet wipes.
Yes, sir.
That didn't scare you, did it?
Sun-hee...
Cut off his leg.
Sun-hee, wait!
Why my leg?!
Where should I begin?
At the cut.
At the hemline for Capri pants.
Mubae! Sir! Please!
Please! Forgive me.
I'll do it right.
How?
Why don't we forget the middleman
and sell directly?
It's feasible with your capacity.
Chicken is common people food.
Surely, no one will pay this
for chicken.
No one in their right mind.
Famous rib marinade - $36.
One rib marinade for Table 14.
Coming!
The plates were untraceable.
Want me to tail Hong?
Later. Later!
How many pints?
- Three.
- Gotcha.
Our chicken's famous now. They're
calling it “Emperor's Chicken”.
People keep posting on their SNS.
It's become a must-eat
for Japanese tourists.
Everyone, please come this way.
Welcome!
We only sell 50 chickens a day.
Saying they'd come back
and not coming back is very hurtful.
What do they think chicken is?
Seasonal delight?
You eat hot dogs in summer
and soup in winter.
Chicken's for every week!
Amen.
Let's knock on their door
and offer free chicken
as an opening gift.
With beer and coke too.
We'll mix roofies into the drinks
and knock them out.
We can't wait any longer.
Let's just do it.
We can't drug them.
We're police for God's sake.
No.
You can't take the
high road with them.
They're criminals.
They commit crimes.
They haven't yet.
We could get arrested for this.
I'm already in a prison
of oil and grease.
So slippery.
We never got approval for this.
What's stopping us now?
I say drug them.
Alright!
Let's go.
I can't believe you.
- Jang! Ma!
- Sir?
How can you even think that
as experienced detectives?
We may be frying chicken, right now,
but we're still law enforcement.
If we behave like thugs,
what sets us apart from them?
Are you thugs?
If you're gonna do as they do,
at least make money like them
instead of your measly paychecks.
That didn't come out right…
What're you looking at?
Captain.
What?
Chief's on the phone.
Are you following my orders
or screwing things up again?
We've been submitting reports.
About those… Look.
Stakeout.
Stakeout.
That's all you've been doing.
I can explain.
Stakeout… stakeout…
50 raw chickens?
What the hell is this?
That's a mistake.
Listen.
I'll be straight with you.
In the upcoming reorganization,
the narcotics division
will be disb...
Sorry.
Again.
Come restructuring,
the narcotics squad will be...
Just answer the damn thing already!
Excuse me.
Chicken never tasted so good.
Is this really chicken?
Thank you for calling
Suwon Rib Marinade Chicken.
Sorry?
Where?
Hey! Where are you going?
Where the hell are you going?
You idiots!
- Newbie.
- Sir.
- Cut the power on my signal.
- Yes, sir.
- Detective Jang.
- Yes, sir.
Set up bugs in the
office and hallway.
Yes, Captain.
Young-ho.
Scan the interior.
I'll divert their attention
by stalling with the card reader.
In and out
within one minute.
Yes, sir!
In case of emergency,
Ma and I will go in as backup.
I'm coming too.
It's done already?
It's urgent, so I got to it.
Chicken never tasted so good.
Oh, that?
It's on its way now.
What took you so long?
Hey, chicken's here.
Let's eat.
Okay.
Where'd everyone go?
What?
They moved out today.
What?
I'll get the money.
Great! Power outtage.
We've been eating and
sleeping here around the clock,
and Chief had to pick today
to bring us in?
You think the Chief could be
in on this with Mubae?
Crazy fool…
Stop that.
You're ruining the sauce.
Who cares if it's ruined?
What's the point if Mubae is gone?!
Strike.
Did I tell you
this squad's gonna be disbanded?
That's why Chief called us.
Nevertheless, we're family.
No...
were family.
So let's laugh about it!
It can't get any worse than this!
It's a farewell party!
Hey…
- Captain!
- Captain!
Let's drug them with roofies.
You dumb sons of a…
oh no…
Catch him.
Just a sec.
Captain…
I'm sorry, sir.
We worried things might go wrong.
We knew about the disbanding,
and we got anxious.
I'm the one to blame.
I got a taste of money.
I was sick and tired of stakeouts,
but sometimes, I stayed out
longer to avoid going home,
to avoid my wife's nagging.
But after becoming the owner
of a successful restaurant,
she started showering at night.
That freaked me out a little.
Still, it made going home a joy.
Sir… Captain…
Cut it out.
I feel like I'm really dying.
You sure it was just roofies?
Why does my neck feel stiff?
At least we have the chicken place.
Let's continue tasting money
because this restaurant
is doing so well.
No secrets to Emperor's Chicken.
After gaining popularity
on social media,
this restaurant put a
preposterous price tag
on their so-called
“Emperor's Chicken”
without any changes to their recipe.
But in reality, there was a change.
They ordered from another restaurant
and switched the packaging.
I'm standing in front
of the restaurant
and in the center of controversy –.
Suwon XX Marinade
Chicken in Changchung.
Captain…
Shut your mouth.
You got the entire squad suspended.
You never cease to amaze me.
If you've been frying chicken all this
time, it means Mubae has resurfaced.
Why didn't you report that to me?
To you?
I tipped you off for a joint investigation,
but you only thought of yourself
and screwed up the entire operation.
Why did you come to me
before reporting to the Chief?
Catching Mubae calls for
a multi-divisional task force,
but you didn't want to share
with anyone else.
You planted us there until
Mubae appeared.
Made us your surveillance cam.
The narc squad is still here
because of me.
You should be thanking me!
Oh, yes! Definitely!
I said I was tired
of you being captain,
so you became a cook instead?
Ma is the cook.
I stayed with you
because you're a good man,
but you ran a fake
business during work hours.
Who told you to bring home
that kind of money?
Maybe it's for the best.
Quit the force once and for all.
You ruined your health on
overtime, stakeouts, and fights.
We get threats from crooks
you put behind bars.
People call you zombie as if
getting stabbed is a funny thing.
Not a day goes by I don't worry
you'll get hurt.
Honey…
Let's start fresh.
I believe in you.
You can do anything.
Thank you.
We have no savings set aside,
but there's your retirement fund.
Let's open a small shop with that.
I'm happy with anything but chicken.
Oh, sweetie…
don't cry over something like this.
Stop!
It's okay. Really.
There, there.
Big boys don't cry.
Come on. It's okay.
No… It's okay.
You don't understand…
- Shhh, it's okay.
- It's not.
No, really.
No, you don't understand.
We can start over.
It's okay. Shhh…
Everything will be fine.
Why are you here?
Why are you?
My wife will divorce me if I
don't get my retirement fund back.
What else can I do?
You're not going back to work?
Even if I do,
I'll be sent to a desk.
I'm suspended, but really,
they want me to quit.
Come on, Captain.
Think about what you've done
to catch Mubae.
All the chicken you served…
Work here until your
suspension's lifted.
We'll divide the earnings equally.
Forget it. Why would we
run a chicken restaurant?
He's right. We're detectives.
Police officers!
Welcome!
Hi.
I'd like to speak to the owner.
Salt.
What's this place?
- After gaining popularity on social media...
- Wow.
- This restaurant put a
preposterous price tag - Idiots.
- On their so-called “Emperor's
Chicken” - That street looks familiar.
I know them.
- Without any changes to their recipe.
- What a trash!
We moved out because
it was getting crowded.
Never play foul with food.
We provide a genuine product
at honest quantities.
Sir.
Why don't we contact them?
What?
…did you say you wanted?
I want to open a
nationwide franchise.
Obviously, you missed the show.
Actually,
I saw it and came straight here.
A solid restaurant won't go down
after one instance of bad media.
The public has a short memory.
You can't go around
defrauding people.
You shouldn't do that anyway,
especially here.
You'll thank me later.
You can go.
Yes.
You'll look back and
thank us all one day.
You're so naïve.
Those who don't know investing
think like you,
but for people like me,
we love seeing competitive products
at rock bottom.
People like us can't stand
those who try to profit
off another's misfortune.
Excuse me.
Here.
Run a check on me.
As you please.
With all due respect,
I don't think I can get much
by defrauding you.
That's true.
I'm not asking for
your business license.
I want your brand name, recipe,
and management know-how.
That's all.
I'm Bong-pal Ma, the cook.
Nice to meet you.
Can you get him some tea?
Sure.
Cap...
Bro.
My daughter, Ye-Jin…
do you know what her dream
was when she was little?
To be a suspect.
That way she'd see me more.
My wife is a devoted Christian,
yet she sewed a talisman into
my underwear for protection.
This is my resignation.
Captain!
I wanted to leave honorably,
but I guess it's come to this.
How will you convince him?
For the sake of justice?
If you live by the law,
that's honorable enough.
I'll help him out
'til business settles.
That's right.
A dad you can see
when you order chicken
is better than a dad you can
only meet as a suspect.
Well, I gotta start saving again so…
Okay…
let's look into this
Jung character first.
People who walk around with
a bundle of cash are suspicious.
Yes.
He checks out.
No criminal record?
Should there be?
Yes!
Sorry…
what about his company?
Even cleaner. Employs
various social groups,
was commended
for being a social enterprise.
Why am I telling you this?
Aren't you a cop?
'Re-open. We are sorry'
The flagship store must do well
for a franchise to flourish!
Does your leg still hurt?
No, now my armpits do.
That's what happens
when you get older.
Yeah…
How's work going?
Jung has a good hold on things.
Our only concern is
Ted Chang might attack.
That's why I'll hit him first.
Now?
Shall I round up the boys?
No need.
Let's go, Sun-hee.
Just the two of you?
That's suicidal.
Hey, Chang-sik!
You're all sunny and bubbly.
If you come to me like this,
it renders my efforts
to find you futile.
I wasn't hiding that hard.
I got bored, so I came.
No, no. Back off.
He fights like a girl.
It's just the two of you?
With a girl?
Is there a wedding invitation?
How's business?
What's good here?
It's a pizza place.
Don't get the noodles.
Wanna see our new menu?
Don't worry about paying
since you're not walking out alive.
Pity. I'm taking herbal medicine.
Can't eat flour.
I'll get to the point.
Let's work together.
Suwon Rib Marinade
Chicken Chicken?
A pizza-kingdom-chicken-princess
kinda place?
This has been my mantra.
School teachers,
students, workers,
civil servants,
priests, and monks alike...
I dream of a world where everyone
can buy drugs like cigarettes.
An era of meth for all.
I perfected it,
and I'm giving it to you.
That's too long a last will.
Lose all the hateful
words, Chang-sik.
My name's Ted Chang.
Okay, Chang-sik.
Ted Chang.
Why are you Ted Chang
when your last name isn't Chang?
You don't know how to
make up an English name, do you?
Look…
you can have all of Korea,
and I'll supply you from China.
You win here. I win there.
So should I let you stab me
in the back again?
Business is good?
Come and have a look.
It's on fire.
Excuse me.
I ordered like 30 minutes ago.
What happened
to table 5's order?
Can't you see I'm eating?
Stop pigging out, and
bring the damn chicken!
I'm frying chicken all day.
I didn't sign up for this shit.
You think I wanted to be a bus boy?
I'll shove your face in that fryer!
Good! Your sister
will love it when I...
- You prick!
- Bring it!
Did you just hit me, asshole?
I'll make sashimi out of you!
I'm gonna kill you!
We're a group of 20!
We don't serve groups.
What?
I said we don't do groups.
Then we'll sit in 4's
and pretend to be strangers.
You're hilarious!
Come on, take a seat.
We're not a group.
Don't talk to other tables.
This tastes funny.
I thought the chicken here was dope.
What did you say? Dope?
Are you saying we're selling dope?
That's not what I meant.
They're calling our chicken dope.
What the hell?
Who said that?
Hey!
They crushed us on TV, and
now they're pounding us online.
We'll be finished for good.
This guy's smoking in the kitchen.
And I thought things were
going smoothly.
People management is
the hardest part of this trade.
Jung, that bastard…
I'm sorry.
You ruined our brand,
and you're sorry?
I'll be sure to hire better crews.
Let me tell you this.
If something like
this happens again,
forget the franchise.
I'm bringing you down with me.
Point taken.
Want me to kill him?
Not necessary.
Maim?
No. Mubae secured a distributor.
Keep a low profile 'til he leaves.
We can't sit around.
We'll visit the branches.
Man-gi Chun. 35.
Gwangju Branch.
26 days smoke-free,
3 days added to life expectancy.
Cook. Hyo-bong Jun.
He chops a size 11 chicken
into 17 pieces with
skilled knife work.
Good. Next.
I surveilled the delivery guy
from 0930 to 2300.
He did an average of
20 to 30 deliveries a day.
Visitors dropped dramatically,
but delivery is still popular?
He delivered 20 orders in one go,
I'm worried the chicken
might get soggy.
20 deliveries?
Is he a newsboy?
I saw something even
more suspicious.
A customer dumped the chicken
as soon as she got it.
What the hell's going on?
Deliveries need to be checked.
Young-ho,
you and I will visit the victims…
I mean, customers.
Jae-hoon,
you're promoted to cook.
Sir?
You've done enough as an assistant.
Can you handle it?
I don't know what to say.
What about me?
You'll be in charge of
regional branches.
Monitor and educate the employees.
You're putting me in charge?
- Jang?
- Sir.
You'll oversee this store
and the metro branches.
Yes, sir.
That's all.
Any questions?
I… um…
I'm a little confused. This
isn't a police operation, right?
This is for the business?
Of course, honey.
Chicken delivery!
Excuse me.
Yes?
I'm looking for a man
who ordered chicken.
He's in there.
The next stop?
Billiard hall. Then…
Exactly the same.
The delivery route is identical.
Does this ring a bell?
Delivery.
I'll wire the money.
Sorry?
- I'll wire it.
- What're you talking about?
Bank transfer… agh!
Don't touch me!
Look at me.
Do it.
Good afternoon.
We're from SK Broadband...
We use KT.
And KT,
here for a routine cable check.
My cable works fine.
Just checking to make sure.
We won't be long.
A bug.
How did you get in here?
Your front door was locked,
so I used the back.
Man, this is bad work ethics.
Dirtier than week-old frying oil.
It's still business hours.
He's okay for someone
from the head office.
He's cool.
Haven't seen an ugly face
like his in a while.
I heard the entire head office
will be cleaned out soon.
Really?
Didn't you know?
They'll hand over the company
to Ted Chang and kill Jung.
Makes sense.
Better for the business.
Where'd you hear that?
Chang's right hand
man is a friend of...
You speak Mandarin?
Yes.
Why?
My family's from China.
Ahhh…
Police lieutenant
Bong-pal Ma Damn…
This is no good.
Wasn't this your idea?
Undercover or some sort?
Not me! Never!
I knew this would happen,
so I gotta steel crutch.
Son of a bitch…
No! Please!
Son of a bitch!
Hey!
Want me to bring in the rest?
Do nothing 'til the rendezvous.
We'll lure the cops in
and kill them there.
Kill them?
Yeah, and Ted Chang
will take the fall.
We'll pin it on him,
take the money, and ride away.
Keep your eyes on
the cops 'til then.
Yes, boss.
Are you insane?!
We should report this.
Our franchise branches are runners.
What does that make us?
Surely they won't think
we're involved.
We must catch them.
Look at their size.
We're way outnumbered.
Besides, we're suspended now.
Who in this county is
capable of a deal this big?
Ted Chang or Mubae.
Police officers or chicken men
don't matter in catching a rat.
Let's catch rats!
Where is Ma?
AWOL since last night.
Think he's gambling again?
Text him.
We can't wait.
We'll go after Jung first.
He cleaned out.
Dammit.
Let's go to his house.
I know the address.
A video call now?
He's gotta be kidding.
Ma!
- Mr. Chicken…
- Detective Ma!
Get your ass over here now.
I don't think he'll last long.
I'll text you the location.
Son of a bitch!
What the hell's going on?
Why are they stalling?
A husband tracker app?
Come on. Let's go.
Are you…?
Come on.
We finish this today.
It's gonna be a long night.
Let's bury them.
You might have to stay longer
in China this time.
Gotta get more money then.
- Let's go to mom's house.
- Yes, boss.
Hong, you're such a momma's boy.
Come back later. I'm busy.
You killed way too many this time.
Momma's gonna be mad.
Jesus, man…
You even brought a crew.
Organized Crime vs organized crime.
4 on 4.
We've got no time. Kill them.
Yes, boss.
Cute.
Let's go.
I'm going first.
I think he's trying to do something.
Filthy ass-face.
Well, well…
It won't go like you think.
This isn't a movie.
What are you doing?
They took him far.
Step on it. Come on!
Don't worry.
Ma isn't gonna die.
I'm not worried about that.
I'm worried he might kill them.
People think I joined the force
through a special
admissions program.
What do you think?
No one believes it,
but I was on the national judo team.
Not bad, right?
You think we're on the same side
because we were tied up together?
Stop!
Stop! Stop! Stop!
His location changed.
Let me see.
What the…
He's close by.
It changed again.
Well, goddammit!
Oh, my arms… my arms…
Missed calls: 132.
Shit.
I got a text from Ma.
What does it say?
- Where the hell are you?
- MB.
Main… building?
Military base?
Shit! Shit! Shit!
You brought a whole regiment.
I have zero trust in you.
If you call the cops again,
I'll kill you.
Oh, you're scaring me.
You carrying a blade?
Bet your ass I am.
Good because we got guns.
We do too.
Show me.
I'm not showing you shit.
Just gimme my money.
I've gotta boat to catch.
The goods first.
This is huge.
Shit! Text me. Text me!
- Can't hear you. Where are you?
- They're all here. Mubae. Ted Chang.
- Speak up!
- Text me.
Shut up. Wait there.
We're coming.
What do I do? Think!
911, 911…
You gonna go through
every single bag?
You're spilling half of it.
All grade A, boss.
You're not taking too much?
I'm okay.
I ate a big lunch.
- You good?
- Yes, sir.
Let's have some trust
between friends.
Bring over the money.
- Test more.
- Yes, sir.
You backstabbing mother...
That's an ambulance, you moron!
Your tiny eyes almost popped out.
I knew it was an ambulance.
Must be a fire nearby.
Drop your weapons!
Why did you shoot me?!
I'm such a genius.
Go on. Kill each other.
Do it. Do it. Do it.
I won't let you.
No, you don't.
You're not going anywhere.
- I won't let you.
- Let me go!
Suwon Rib Marinade Chicken.
This just isn't my scene…
You can't get away.
Get the money.
- Aren't you embarrassed?
- Man…
Did you request backup?
They have no one to dispatch.
It's Mubae and Ted Chang.
We gotta get there.
Yes, sir.
Can I fight now, Captain?
Like a real cop!
Wait.
Okay!
You're from the head store.
You gotta present for us.
Take him and leave.
I'll let you live.
Looks like more than 30 bucks,
so I can't take it.
Come with me.
Cops these days have no fear.
Are you… just four?
We're five, dumb-ass!
Back down. You're injured.
I'll just get one of them.
These morons…
kill them!
Narcs will get killed.
It's manageable.
Sorry?
You can talk sense with thugs,
but dope heads are just plain crazy.
Why do you think
the Chief put them together?
Ma is an ex-judo national athlete.
What do you want from me?
You said I'm uglier than you.
Do you know hurtful that is?
Young-ho is ex-UDT.
I've heard rumors
he's killed people.
Jang is a Muay Thai Asian champion.
She was nicknamed.
'Jang Bak' after Ong Bak.
What about that newbie?
High school baseball league.
Baseball?
In this country, if you play ball,
you grow resilient to blows.
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.
It doesn't hurt one bit.
What about Captain Ko?
They don't call him
'zombie' for nothing.
In the 20 years he's been with
Major Crimes Division,
he's sustained 12 stab wounds
and still lived.
He just doesn't die.
Mubae!
Argh… this guy!
Jae-hoon?
Jae-hoon!
Dammit…
I don't go easy on women.
My eye!
I won't die! I won't die!
I will not die!
That son of a bitch…
Hey!
You bruised up his face,
and that's all he's got!
Stop! You'll kill her!
Enough!
Fine…
Jae-hoon…
Don't fuss.
Tying them up is harder
than busting their asses.
Care to help?
Yes, sir.
I'll finish him then get to you.
Okay.
Actually, let's tie your legs first.
- Yes, let's do that.
- Gimme your legs.
This is good.
Thank you, sir.
- We can do this, right?
- Of course.
Oh, good Christ!
I'm not gonna die.
I'm not gonna die.
Come here, you piece of shit.
That….
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Blood!
I don't have a gun, idiot.
I'm not a police officer now.
Then what are you?
Me? I'm a chicken man.
That's what you went with?
Who you are doesn't matter
when catching a rat.
I'll let you go. Just stop.
You can swim, right?
Just jump over.
I can't swim.
Why stick out your neck for nothing?
Because you did wrong.
Here's what you don't get
about small business owners.
We stick our necks out
for what we do.
So fuck off!
You bastard!
Holy shit…
Call an ambulance.
This time it was a gun.
I cannot believe this.
My first arrest
and I don't remember anything.
He took a bullet for you.
You're my father from today on!
Don't…
Did you say something, father?
Come again?
That hurts, you idiot.
Did you mean that?
What?
That good looks is all I've got?
What else is there?
And you installed a husband tracker?
Because you keep getting in trouble.
Aw, aw, aw, that hurts.
Sir!
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Sir?
I gotta shoot someone.
Is it loaded?
I gotta shoot them.
What did you say, dad?
It's not loaded, sir.
Stop them. Stop both of them.
Please….
It was a shuttle bus
that caught Hong?
It was a school bus!
And now the appointment ceremony.
Sergeant Bong-pal
Ma, Narcotics squad,
is hereby appointed lieutenant.
The Chief of Seoul District
Police Department, Sang-il Baek.
Have you seen an entire squad
get a special promotion?
Guess who put together that team?
Arms down. Turn around.
Attention. Salute!
