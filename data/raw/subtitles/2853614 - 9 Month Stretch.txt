9 MONTH STRETCH
My name is Ariane Felder.
I'm 40. I'm a judge.
I work a 10-15 hour day
at the High Court
if you count hearings,
files, reports,
witness statements, notes
and... photocopying.
"High" is too fancy a word.
When your own office is a box,
Imprisoning someone
smacks of vengeance. It isn't.
People are reckless. My job is
to protect them from themselves.
INDICTMENT
I love my job.
I'm single. No kids.
I'm fine without males
and their urges.
A little dance and
everything's hunky-dory.
What's more, working in family
courts confirmed my ideas
about relationships.
Children act out a tragedy
Written by their parents.
My mom was alone too.
But it wasn't her choice.
My dad left when I was kid.
It's an easy step
to call men cowards
and one I have no
qualms about taking.
Especially as Mom died
after bringing me up.
It's New Year's Eve.
Everyone's celebrating.
The lawyers, mainly.
I don't see what's so great
about a new year!
100 to 150 fresh cases
and as many victims to lament.
No cause for celebration.
But lawyers are like anyone else.
Oh, Ariane!
You can't be working!
Come and dance.
Some lookers out there!
Have some champagne.
Just one glass. Just a drop.
It's New Year's Eve.
Sometimes blending in
is the best escape.
That's where booze comes in.
A few drinks and you
don't really care.
Guilty?
Or not guilty?
Guilty!
That's gory!
Happy New Year!
Leave off!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
This is fun!
I'll get a drink.
Wait for me.
Another round for the judge!
THE BAR NEW YEAR'S PARTY
6 months later
Look, my hand did that.
I was in the bathroom. I went to grab
the toothpaste or the shower head.
I had to reach out for it.
My wife came in.
I didn't mean it.
I stuck out my hand.
Next thing she was on the floor.
Why did she throw herself
on my fist? Makes no sense.
It ain't my fault.
I'm innocent. Why me?
Stretching exercises.
To quote the doctor's report:
"Bruised eye, cracked bone."
"Unconscious for 4 minutes."
It wasn't 4 minutes.
1 or 2, more like!
A band-aid and it was sorted.
It happened in the bathroom.
His wife slipped on a bar of
soap and hit the washbasin.
That's obviously no excuse.
No excuse?
Know what it is?
It's fate, judge.
Yes, we must take a wider view.
Right!
Let's hear the soap
and the washbasin.
I shouldn't really tell you,
but I just have to.
If the decision goes through
and there's no objection,
in 6 months you'll be
at the Court of Appeals.
Remarkable at your age.
I'm very proud of you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Bye. Mum's the word!
Hello!
Hello, Godfrey.
- How are you?
- Fine.
Looking good.
Thanks.
- So all's well?
- Very well.
Well, bye then.
Goodbye, Godfrey.
See you soon, maybe.
Yes, maybe.
Goodbye!
What a pain.
He's unbelievable.
Oh, forget it. He's nuts.
I've felt exhausted for
a while and dizzy.
And I'm late so my doctor
suggested I should see you.
Firstly, do you feel stressed:
A) At work?
B) In your love life?
I'm an intelligent woman.
Meaning?
I'm single.
Are you kidding?
No, it's the truth.
You're pulling my leg.
No, it's just... I don't...
The symptoms are a baby boy.
He weighs 23 ounces
and measures 12 inches.
Pregnancy denial.
A violent and unconscious
refusal by the mother.
The fetus develops in secret.
The mind ignores it up
to a certain point.
Then it starts to show.
The baby can't just vanish.
Judging by the size and weight
you're 6 months pregnant,
give or take a couple of weeks.
Abortion's not an option.
Don't you know
it's illegal this late?
You can't remember? Or you won't?
6 months give or
take 2 weeks.
The sentence?
How long do you recommend?
6 months... and 2 weeks!
For a double homicide?
Yes.
That's good.
There you go! You've got talent.
That's kind of you.
I'm better at partying, aren't I?
New Year's Eve?
What a night!
You were...
I was...
Go on.
You know...
You mean that night we...
Oh yes.
All night long.
Never thought you'd be so keen.
So that's why
you keep smiling at me?
Don't be angry.
I wanted to see you again.
Damn!
Shall we?
Right.
One last shot.
See? It's easy.
Relax.
Ready, steady...
Swing!
As hard as you can.
I'm so sorry.
I've really messed you up.
I'm sorry.
Ariane! What brings you here?
I'd like to order
a comparative DNA test.
Why not follow normal procedure?
It's for a paternity test.
A paternity test?
Using the forensic computer?
That's quite unusual.
When did it happen?
Last January.
The DNA's still good?
Yes, it's a recent sample.
You said January.
There's DNA from January
and a recent sample for comparison.
That sure is some DNA!
Put it there.
Hold on.
Give it to me.
There.
No more chat from him.
I've got a friend at the lab.
I'll ask for his help
and discretion.
I'll keep you posted.
I really have to go.
I won't kiss you goodbye.
Bye, Ariane.
Stop by any time!
De Bernard (family history)
Good news. We found the father!
De Bernard?
Who?
No, nothing. Sorry.
No match with that DNA sample,
but they found someone.
The guy's got previous.
He's in jail!
Your suspect is Robert Nolan.
Aka Bob Nolan.
I've looked into him.
No surprises. The usual sob story.
Absent father, alcoholic mother.
Mistook him for a log once.
Put him on the fire.
Got kicked out of nursery.
Got kicked out of an orphanage.
Thrown out by his foster parents.
Thrown out of school.
Got fired from his apprenticeship.
Shown the door so often
he learned to open them.
He became a thief.
He actually became
something of a virtuoso.
But not long ago
he was accused
of a strange murder.
In the middle of a "job" on a flat
he was caught by the owner.
A poor 83-year-old widower.
Imagine, to keep him quiet,
he decided to attack him
and saw him up with a grinder!
A grinder!
And then he gobbled up his eyes.
The doctors saved the old man,
but you should see him now.
Can someone turn on the lights?
I need to pee.
It's not possible.
It's not possible.
It's impossible!
It doesn't suit my... case.
Trust me.
It's not possible!
Not possible!
It's impossible!
Judge Felder?
That's me.
I'm Inspector Edwards.
Here's the DNA report you ordered.
Thank you.
I brought 'im.
I can see that.
I mean Nolan. I got 'im out.
Who?
The crazy Eye-Gobbler!
On day release.
You've got time to grill him
until his lawyer shows up.
What?
It's legal.
His lawyer's on his way.
More legal
than gobbling eyes anyway.
Come on, Madam.
His lawyer'll be here soon.
I'm not supposed to...
Isn't it your case?
No. I mean yes. But it's...
Hurry up then, Madam.
Go on.
Come and have a look.
On his own,
or he might eat an inmate.
There's a monster.
An inhuman beast.
Impressive, eh?
A real beast.
Eye-eating's one thing, but
according to the shrinks' report
he can only go with hookers.
Imagine that! Only with hookers!
Madam?
What are you doing?
Come back. Make him talk.
Near the High Court
on New Year's Eve?
6 months.
We can only keep footage for one.
I know the law
and what really happens.
True. Sometimes we do keep footage
a bit longer.
National security.
Okay. Would you mind?
Not at all, Madam.
Here you go.
Can you give me a rough time?
9 pm onward.
High Court.
9 pm.
It needs to warm up.
Just a second, it's loading.
Lots of data.
Right. High Court about 9:30 pm.
They're compressed images.
We speed them up to save space.
There!
Is that her?
- Let's zoom in.
- No!
We can't see her face.
No need.
I can tell who it is.
That's good enough.
Let's move on, shall we?
She's leaving.
Lost her. I should find her later.
I'll go back onto the mainframe.
She took Desmond St
so she could be in Bank St.
There she is.
I'll blow it up.
Drunk as a skunk!
What am I...
What are you...
Nothing.
She's off again.
Back to the mainframe.
Where is she?
There, look.
Playing soccer.
A different camera.
She's scored a goal.
She's acting pretty weird.
And now, bang, into a post.
Let me switch cameras.
Lost her again. But I'll find her.
I guess she walked that way.
Down the main streets. There!
That's the red-light district
where the hookers are.
Is she lecturing them?
Not a good move.
See, it's hotting up now.
Someone's stepping in.
I'll switch again.
Stop!
A close-up of him!
There you go.
I've lost them again but
I'll catch up soon.
It won't take long.
Wait a sec...
There!
I'll zoom in.
Now from a different angle.
Getting to know each other.
A little cigarette.
A little shimmy.
Now she's dancing.
That's ballet.
Gee, she looked shy
but far from it!
Get it on!
I'll switch cameras again.
Holy moly!
She's a real character.
Woah, she's...
I thought I'd seen it all
but this one...
Do you want a close-up?
No, that's enough!
Put it on a sealed disk.
I'm taking it with me.
- We're done?
- Yes, we're done!
Judge Felder.
That's aw-awfully bad luck.
Really?
She's the f-fiercest.
And the s-smartest.
She'll be head of the Court
of Appeals some day.
But w-w-what's she got
to do with your case?
What about your release
from c-c-custody?
They have to
in-inform me!
This is tur...
t-turning into le-legal
ha-harassment.
I should have been here
this m-morning.
What the p-police did
isn't le-legal.
We won't let them!
Come on!
Your Honor!
Mr. Trolos,
you cannot come in here!
What are the charges?
I w-want the ch-ch...
- The charges.
- And about the cu-cu...
- Custody.
- Thank you!
You want charges? Ok then.
12/29/2010:
Attack on an armored van on the A16.
Gunfire. 2 million stolen.
1 officer wounded. Case open.
Where were you?
Too early for hookers.
Answer me!
At home, I guess.
- In France?
- Yeah.
Doesn't look good.
That's one charge.
W-w-what?
12/23/12...
Soudray Street.
A jeweler's burgled.
Guns, 500,000 stolen. Masked men.
Put this on!
This is absurd.
Put the mask on!
Oh dear!
What a resemblance!
You're in trouble, pal.
We'll investigate that one too.
- I want a lawyer.
- But I-I'm here.
I'm not done yet!
03/15/12, evening.
Sotto Park, a girl found
raped and killed.
Not popular, child murderers!
You were...
On Earth.
What a coincidence!
Well, you wanted three charges.
- There you are.
- You've no evidence.
Who needs evidence?
You've got some charges now.
We'll look into this grim business.
He will stay in custody given
the severity of the charges.
That's ridiculous.
W-why not accuse him of being
Jack the Ripper too!
Not a bad idea.
Maybe he just looks young.
I prefer you without a wig.
Get out!
Get out, I said!
Why these charges?
Hands! Let go of that.
I should have been
informed in a-a-advance.
Wig?
I don't understand.
That wig stuff m-made her mad.
A jailbird trick.
Words that drive judges nuts.
"Wig" is one of them.
Really?
Say "wig" and they go crazy?
Incredible!
Little bastard.
For trespassing
and breaking
into private property,
for occupying the premises
without the owner's permission,
for disrupting
by your presence
the said owner's health,
for expecting
emotional support
for months and years to come,
with no legitimate claim,
immorally and irresponsibly,
this court
sentences you to eviction...
and immediate execution!
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid.
I don't eat eyes!
I just want to talk.
I made you breakfast.
I don't eat eyes, stupid!
Let's talk.
Gently, gently!
Don't hurt yourself.
Can we talk now?
I recognized you yesterday.
I don't care how you
spend your nights.
But I understand you're a top judge.
Which is good because I've nothing
to do with this eye-gobbling attack.
So I won't mention your nights and
you help me with my case. Right?
How?
You find the flaw.
There has to be a snag or something!
Look, it's not my case.
With a good lawyer...
My lawyer's Trolos.
Indeed, that's not...
I came here after breaking out.
That's a sign.
Why is the law
after you for this business?
There must be a good reason.
Your record?
What record?
I'm a burglar,
so I'm capable of this atrocity?
"The thin end of the wedge."
How dare you!
Don't hurt me! For its sake.
You're full of it!
- I know...
- I don't mean that.
You weren't trying
to hurt it last night, eh?
What do you mean?
You know, I've never seen
an abortion like that.
What are you talking about?
Let go of me!
Shh! Or I'll eat your tongue.
Does this ring any bells?
Now and then I do a
spot of cleaning
but I can't recall yesterday.
Cleaning, my ass!
You wanted to abort
by doing belly-flops.
What?
And you a judge.
What's wrong with you?
None of your business.
None of my business?
A judge wouldn't
appreciate that reply.
It's in your books.
It's called
"refusal to provide evidence."
Gotcha!
And I'm in charge here!
Because I'm stronger.
See?
Get it?
How many months?
Five.
And how long is it?
Nine.
Yeah, well,
I don't know that girly stuff.
Excuse me for being a guy!
What are you doing?
I'm deliberating.
4 months in prison!
4 months locked up here!
Because 5 plus 4 is 9.
See, I'm pretty smart too.
"And given the charges
that's lenient!"
Know that one too?
I do, trust me.
"This verdict may be reviewed
under certain conditions."
It means if you scratch my back...
Come on.
"Exercise twice a day
and set mealtimes."
Know that one by heart too!
What have I done?
I made you dinner.
Shepherd's pie and water.
Ta-da!
I'll put it here
in case you want a bite.
Could we talk about my case?
There, there.
A child's not so bad.
Pretty good news, actually.
What about him?
Spared a thought for the father?
See, you're not alone.
He's there.
He's a wacko and a lunatic.
Shit!
Pretty precise definition!
If he heard you!
He doesn't know
I'm having his child.
Not a very bright spark then!
Don't get me wrong,
but is he in your business?
You could say that.
There you go!
Lawyer? Cop?
Neither.
Still a glimmer of hope then!
He can't be all bad!
Can we talk about my case now?
Please?
Don't make me feel sorry for you!
This could take a very long time.
Carry on like this
and he'll be born right here!
Plop on the floor!
Cry if you want,
but there'll be no dinner!
Bye-bye shepherd's pie and all that.
He's an inhuman monster.
He shouldn't be alive.
No animal would do what he did.
Animals kill to eat, not like that.
To be killed is one thing but to have
your organs eaten is unacceptable.
Organs are useful, especially eyes.
They should never let him out.
It's disgusting.
He's a freak.
I'd never heard of anyone
eating eyes before.
He's a degenerate.
Abnormal.
Eye-eating
removes every clue,
even the last thing the victim sees.
Is he still a human being?
Of course not.
Crazy! Weird!
Whatever word you like.
The frenzied world of the killer.
These people are incapable of love.
Such creatures would
fill Darwin with doubt.
Evolution has not affected
these prehistoric beasts.
There's not much I can do.
I'm not the lead attorney.
I don't know the case.
What if you saw it?
- What?
- My case file.
Who is the lead attorney?
His name rhymes with "bastard".
- Ring any bells?
- Yes.
Good rhyme.
Come in.
What do you want?
I came to apologize
for my clumsiness.
Clumsiness? You did it on purpose!
I was angry and I acted stupidly.
Do forgive me.
Stop the slapping.
I won't be intimidated.
I can get angry too.
See?
Please sit down.
Oh, thank you!
I've got a few questions
about the Eye-Gobbler.
Go ahead.
Well...
Bang!
All right then.
Very well...
He who bangs last bangs longest!
Go on.
I wondered if he'd ever been violent
during a previous burglary.
No, but that's irrelevant.
Isn't it odd that a repeat burglar
should suddenly
start butchering his victims?
Caught red-handed,
he panics and turns violent.
Mutilation, eyes. It's logical!
Logical?
Why would he turn violent now?
Needed to freshen up his style.
The facts speak for themselves.
He was on the scene near the time.
He's a pretty obvious suspect.
Could I have a glance at the file?
I draw the line there.
Not this time.
You dance with me and act nice,
then blank me for months.
You come golfing.
Hit me with a club!
Why all the smiles now?
What are you after?
The case file.
Let's keep calm.
I'll do what I like!
It's my office to get angry in.
It relaxes me
to get angry.
I like being angry!
You don't scare me.
Know where you can
shove your request?
It doesn't say "moron" here.
Sorry?
Get out!
I didn't say...
Out! Now!
I didn't say...
Get the hell out!
I don't want to see
or deal with you again!
It's unacceptable!
You have no respect!
Please leave now!
Please!
Godfrey!
Shit!
What did you do?
I didn't do it.
Course not.
I swear it wasn't me.
Nobody else came in here.
Hope your lawyer's good.
- Is he dead?
- No, but...
Come on!
Anyway... who cares.
Madam!
Good to see you!
Y-You had no right
to take my client out of prison!
Th-thought I w-wouldn't find out?
This...
I'm not so stupid!
T-this is going to the t-top.
Wait till they catch him.
I'll m-make sure that
your s-superiors h-have to act!
Wig!
Wig!
I really need a lawyer.
You're looking at me as if I was...
Guilty, yes.
We know that.
Nothing caught your eye?
You were the only identified
person on the scene.
You're sure you didn't...
fly off the handle?
How exactly?
No drink or drugs?
Mind go blank?
Happens to the best of us, even me.
It's not impossible, mind.
It might make sense.
Maybe I thought of my mom.
She had a speech impediment.
She'd say "eat some eyes"
instead of "eat some pies."
Maybe that made me eat his eyes.
You can't be that gullible!
- No, it's the thingy.
- The baby?
You can't do that here.
You said 9 months!
It's way too early!
It's not finished yet.
Tell me what to do.
There!
What are you doing?
I'm scaring him back inside.
It's okay now.
I feel better.
False alarm.
At least he isn't deaf.
Or he's a coward like most men.
Where were we?
You reach Mr. de Lime's at 1 am.
You enter the poor man's house.
Poor?
He can't have been poor
if I was robbing him!
A figure of speech.
Figures of speech won't help me.
The whole jury
will feel pity for him
even though he's stinking rich.
Probably a robber himself.
It won't help being militant,
so let's stick to the facts.
All right.
I enter this filthy
rich man's house.
You break into Mr. de Lime's house.
If you say so.
You're cracking the safe
when he Walks in.
You go crazy.
You jump him with a
grinder at 1:45 am.
The victim's statement says
that the last thing he saw
was his antique clock.
I go crazy... That makes no sense.
If he'd seen me,
I wouldn't have attacked him,
I'd have run off!
How about suicide?
Have you considered that?
How exactly?
He gets up in the night to pee.
He doesn't recognize himself
in the mirror.
Good evening.
Suddenly he realizes it's him.
That old man is him.
Time has ﬂown and life sucks.
He's depressed.
So he grabs a grinder
from his toolbox
and eats his eyes so he won't see,
then chops himself up!
He's blind, so he makes a mess!
He didn't have a grinder.
No grinder? All right then...
He uses an electric saw.
Everyone's got one.
I usually have a few on me.
He saws away.
He saws away by hand because
he's very depressed.
Cuts all over.
He hates himself!
He chops and chops.
He cuts himself again and again
like it says in the medical report!
Even the dumbest experts
won't buy that.
I'm sure the man
was depressed in the past.
An accident?
Some stupid accident? Huh?
- Like what?
- Like an accident!
No one's to blame! An accident!
Same thing. He gets up
in the middle of the night to pee.
He gets up.
He's got to pee.
Wait for it...
Right, got it.
He gets up in the night to pee.
He gets up to pee as usual.
It's night, he's old.
He gets up in the night to pee.
But he's old and half-asleep...
so he takes a wrong turn.
He goes into the kitchen.
It's ultra-modern, full of sharp objects.
I saw them.
He hasn't peed in a while.
He's got problems:
organs, "prospate", that stuff.
It's 3 weeks since he peed.
He takes a huge leak!
It short-circuits the place.
All hell breaks loose.
Gets his feet tangled up
and slips in his pee.
All the sharp objects
start flying around
and fall on him.
Like that!
I know you're going to say,
"What about the eyes?"
It's quite simple.
Pretty obvious for the eyes.
It's the mixer in the kitchen!
All of a sudden the short-circuit
makes it start to feel involved
and it falls down into his eyes.
That explains the eyes!
It all makes perfect sense.
It's simple.
There's got to be something!
These events took place
on January 1, 2013
between 1:20 and 3:30 am.
What the hell? Are you nuts?
Not at all.
I was thinking.
And they say I'm crazy.
You have an odd way of thinking!
Yes?
I'll splash some water on my face.
So I can think better.
Lots of water!
Because...
I really need to think.
Are you done thinking?
After the burglary do you
remember what you did next?
If I'm wrong,
you jump out the window?
Answer my question.
The usual, I guess. You know...
I see what you mean.
Nothing special?
Not that I recall.
Think hard for once!
Take it easy.
When people shout, I go to bits.
That's why I was bad at school.
Hold on.
All right.
The thing is...
It was probably the same as usual.
Saw some girlfriends, you know.
That kind of thing.
I'm sorry.
I feel for you, I really do.
Doesn't look good.
I want to help, but...
I know you're lying.
I know you are!
It'd kill you to say it.
Because you'd have to admit
your system can screw up...
You're wrong.
Totally wrong.
You won't get away with this.
Watch out,
I'll tell them everything.
Without a second thought.
It would hardly be
admissible evidence.
You nasty piece of work!
"Newrotic."
Judge Felder?
It's Inspector Edwards.
May I come in?
Yes, of course.
PATERNITY TEST
Probable father (Robert Nolan)
Got friends over?
I hope that's allowed.
Of course! I'm sorry.
I took the liberty of stopping by
because our man's been seen
in the neighborhood.
We've been doing checks.
I saw you lived here
and I think he's coming for you.
You think so?
I'm sure of it.
Guys like him are ruthless.
Kind of you.
I'll keep my eyes open.
Don't!
If you see him, keep them closed.
Right.
Thanks for the advice.
I hope I didn't scare you.
Goodbye, Madam.
Thank you.
What? I didn't tell him.
No need to freak out!
Nothing.
I was just a bit shaken,
that's all.
Well, well...
Quite emotional for an old hand.
No wonder you get caught.
Too right.
I should get another job.
I'd best be going.
It's crawling with cops,
so now is a good time!
Hide out here for a few days.
What will you do with the baby?
None of your business.
If I may say so,
you should keep it.
Orphanages aren't so great.
Really.
I should know.
You may not.
When you said the father
was a wacko lunatic,
you were just pissed, right?
No, he is a wacko and a lunatic.
In that case better not keep it.
You don't want to raise
a little wacko lunatic.
Plenty out there. No need for
any more wacko lunatics.
You're not a wacko lunatic.
With a bit of luck,
he'll take after you.
Mind your own business.
I am. If something's up with him,
they'll pin it on me.
Because I kept you here.
So...
You're mad!
Wait until it's dark, at least.
Don't worry.
I'm right here.
Ms. Felder, my dear colleague,
I inform you that there
have been no objections
to your appointment as legal
counsel to the Court of Appeals.
Your request will be confirmed
by the next decree
at the end of the semester.
Mr. Bemet, go on. Tell the judge
what you told me yesterday.
Come on, Mr. Bemet.
I... Go on, say it!
Don't be scared.
I... I... apo-apo...
He said, "I apologize,"
Your Honor.
Type:
"I note Mr. Bemet's apologies
for the murders
of his wife and neighbor."
It's a start.
Sounds more like the end.
So you slipped on the soap
and hit the washbasin.
Your partner's innocent
so you want to drop the charges.
That's right.
Just an everyday accident.
Well, yes.
I'm sorry for the trouble.
No problem.
Next time you'll be dead.
And less chatty.
The Eye-Gobbler has been caught.
The moron stayed in town.
Shots were fired.
Is he dead?
Unfortunately not.
Bastard!
They messed up!
I meant you.
Really?
Today a remarkable case in legal
history reaches its conclusion.
The case of Bob Nolan,
the Eye-Gobbler.
Mr. Trolos has the honor
of defending
the lost cause of Bob Nolan.
Society has to be protected
from its own monsters.
If someone craves human ﬂesh,
we must put him on a diet.
C-Chopped him up...
So what?
So what?
Why call him a pervert?
Or a maniac?
Or some sort of f-f-freak?
Let's talk instead about scru...
about scruples
of the mind?
W-what scruples?
What kind?
They're part of-of human nature.
That is my first point!
Now...
an eye-gobbler?
Fine.
Very well.
We shall m-make n-n-note of that!
Did you know that in New G-G-Guinea
people in the highlands
are cannibals,
but n-not the people
living on the coast?
Interesting!
W-Why is that? I a-ask you.
S-Scientists
ha-have identified
the protein needs
of people in the highlands.
Well then,
have we considered
the p-protein needs
of him?
Take that!
F-Further mitigating
air-circumstances.
Turning to the
ps-psy-psychiatrists' report.
He's a b-big kid.
S-Sick maybe
but a-a-a big kid
nonetheless!
Wallop!
Your Honor, my thanks.
Both sides have been heard.
The court will now deliberate...
Please!
Please!
Judge Felder?
Sorry?
Please!
I wish to testify by virtue
of your discretionary powers.
Are you unwell?
I would like to testify.
- Public prosecutor?
- No objection.
Mr. Trolos?
Say yes, say yes.
Yes.
Not to me!
To the judge!
I don't trust her.
Don't! Trust her!
Go on, say yes.
If it goes wrong, I'll shout "wig"!
Forget about that! Just say yes.
Say yes!
Y-Yes!
Thank you, Mr. Trolos.
You may speak.
On January 1, 2013
from 1:20 to 2:30 am
the accused couldn't...
Speak up. We can't hear you.
He couldn't have been
with the victim as he was...
He was...
With me!
W-What?
Sorry?
On what business?
It's personal.
Are you saying that you had
a relationship with the accused?
Yes.
How can you be so
sure about the time?
From 1:45 to 1:57 am
several times
his watch was right in front
of my eyes as we were...
You were...
He's right-handed and we were...
His hand... His watch... My face...
When we were...
Please, Judge Felder,
show some respect for the court.
My apologies, Your Honor.
That night's events
were recorded on CCTV.
With greater care, the prosecution and
defense could have studied the tapes
and in a few clicks they could
have recognized us both.
The time code
shows when it all happened.
If you give me a little more time
I can give more evidence
of our relationship.
Thank you, Your Honor.
During an olfactory parade
the police enabled the victim
to identify the Eye-Gobbler.
A psychopath suffering
from paranoid bulimia
who was out on parole for a
rehab schema for anorexics
eventually confessed
to assaulting Mr. de Lime
and eating his eyes.
Why eat his eyes?
Why the eyes?
A few words please.
Wrongly accused of being the Eye-Gobbler,
Bob Nolan has been released.
He is to start a strict
rehabilitation program.
Judge Felder,
your outrageous behavior in public
has brought disgrace upon the bar.
The Bar Association has been forced
to take disciplinary action.
You Will soon receive
your demotion letter
with the terms of your transfer.
If you protest in public
or to the media
your license to practice
will be revoked.
I thought you were in rehab.
I thought you were giving him up.
Is he...
I mean, he's not...
Not a wacko lunatic?
No.
He looks pretty good!
He seems...
good with his fingers, doesn't he?
I'm not saying
he'll become a criminal.
Could well have your brains.
Better not end up as a cop though.
But if he's got brains
he won't be a cop.
A judge perhaps?
A judge...
All right.
Not perfect but quite all right.
What's his name then?
What do you think?
Don't know...
Kevin? Kevin sounds good.
I'm not a big fan of Kevin.
Don't like Kevin? I do.
Not really, no.
Okay then...
Steve!
Steve sounds pretty good, huh?
Steve's... It's not bad.
Bob and Steve. Not bad!
My brother was called Steve.
- He isn't dead?
- No, he's sleeping.
