Chance got it, dude.
Chance fucking has it.
How you been, man?
Come in for a picture.
Oh, my God.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
I didn't even fucking tell them.
They just started doing that.
I didn't even fucking tell them anything.
Why'd you stop?
What are you doing?
No, Brad didn't... You want a bump?
You want more coke? Cool.
- You guys want a bump? Yeah?
- Yeah.
In your mouth?
Your friend's a pro. You want one?
Let's do it.
- Fucking A, man.
- That was cuckoo.
- You want some coke, Brad?
- No, I'm good, bro. I'm good.
You want a little... Take a little...
Take a little like this.
Put a little on your gums?
- I'm straight, bro.
- Sure?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.
Don't worry about it.
Shit.
Man.
- Shit.
- Leah. Leah. Leah. Come here.
Come in here. Come in here. We got coke.
- You want some coke? Come in.
- I'm cool.
No. What, you wanna do a bump?
I'm gonna take off.
- What are you doing?
- Are you embarrassed right now?
No, man. No.
I'm not fucking embarrassed.
I'm just tired.
Okay, you need to liven up a little bit.
- 'Cause this is a sure thing.
- I know.
Right here, it's fucking...
I know. I'm just not into it tonight.
I love you. I gotta call it a night, okay?
It's about Leah?
Bro, how long are you chasing that?
Fucking...
Fuck off, B.
- Okay? I'm not leaving 'cause of Leah.
- All right, all right.
Dude, this party is
fucking weird as hell anyway.
All right. Tell Mom and Dad I said hi.
- Okay, I will. I love you.
- I'm sorry.
No, no, no. I'm just fucking...
Just don't drive tonight.
Hey! I know you, right?
Me?
Yeah. Hey, I saw you inside.
Do you think I can get a ride?
- Where are you going?
- Not far.
I'm sorry, dude. It's kind of late.
I got to get home.
Come on, man. It's right up the road.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, sure.
Yeah, this is me right here.
All right, hang on a sec.
Let me grab my boy.
- Your boy?
- Yeah.
Look, it'll just take a sec, man. I swear.
Okay.
Fucking kidding me?
Weren't taking off without us, were you?
No. No, no, no. I was just waiting.
- All right.
- Yeah.
All right. Thanks, man.
All right.
So, wait. How do you guys know Colin?
Who the fuck is Colin, man?
He's the kid whose house we were at.
Oh, right. Yeah, it's his boy.
Right, man?
Yeah.
You guys go to Brookman?
My brother goes there.
Brookman? No, man. We go somewhere else.
Just keep driving.
Straight?
Yeah, yeah, man. Keep going.
It's a ways.
I thought you said
it was just up the road.
- We getting close?
- Yeah. Yeah, man. Take a left.
- What, here?
- Yeah.
Listen, guys. I gotta get back home.
Hey, relax, man. We're almost there.
I know. It's just late. Is there
some place close I can drop you off?
- Where do you suggest?
- I don't know, man.
I'm about to turn around
any second, though.
Wait, wait.
Hey, man. What's your problem?
You're freaking out like a little bitch.
Stop being such a baby.
For real, man.
I'm not being a baby, man.
You told me it was just up the road.
I've been driving 20 minutes. Like...
All right. Okay. All right. Pull over then.
Look, man. I'm not, you know...
Stop the fucking car!
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Your hand's shaking.
Okay. What do you guys want? Seriously.
Relax. We're here now anyway.
- Stop! Okay, stop! Stop, stop!
- Motherfucker!
Stop!
Look, you don't need to hurt me, okay?
What do you want?
I'll give you whatever you want.
Okay. Okay.
What's your ATM code?
What?
Tell me your fucking ATM code right now,
or I swear to God I'll fucking kill you.
4-1-1-4.
- Don't fucking lie to me.
- It's 4-1-1-4.
I swear to God, dude, I'm not...
Can you please just let me go?
Shut the fuck up.
Look, I don't have anything.
Shut up. Stop talking.
Okay.
All right. Okay.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Wanna get in on this?
Come on, man. Let's go.
No, no. I'm fine.
- What is this?
- Easy, easy, easy.
Just give me a sec, bro.
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.
I've been driving around for three hours
with a knife in my car,
trying to find these guys.
Chance is coming over with his dad's gun.
I swear to God,
we're gonna fucking kill them.
It doesn't matter, Brett.
Of course it fucking matters.
They're not gonna
get away with this, Brad.
You're never gonna find them, man.
Well, tell me what they look like.
They don't look like anything. Okay?
What the fuck are you talking about,
"They don't look anything"?
Brad. Fuck!
All right.
- So, did they have a weapon?
- No, not that I was aware of.
But they forced their way into the car?
No.
So, you gave two complete strangers a ride
out in the middle of nowhere,
because you're a nice guy...
- No, I told...
- I'm just trying to understand.
I told you that they were at the party,
and that they asked me for a ride home.
- And they tried to steal your car.
- Yes.
I've seen your car.
What I can't understand is
why they beat you up so bad.
Did you say something to them?
Call them something? Resist?
- Provoke?
- Fuck do I know?
You know what I think?
I think you were looking for drugs.
I think you were
trying to buy drugs from these guys
and things got out of hand.
It happens. This I can help you with.
I wasn't trying to buy drugs.
Okay. Not trying to buy drugs.
I don't know what else to tell you.
You go home and get some rest.
We'll follow up.
Fuck.
What are you doing here?
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah, you, too.
- Thanks, man.
- Got you.
So, what you been up to?
Yeah, dude. I'm sorry.
I haven't been back before now.
I've just been crazy busy, you know.
- How you doing?
- Good.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah. Mom said you're thinking
about bailing on school.
I'm not bailing on it.
I just don't know
if I can get all my shit together
before the fall, you know.
But you're already accepted for the fall.
Plus, Phi Sig is only rushing in the fall.
I don't know, man.
I'm not putting any pressure on you.
I'm just saying.
You should come this weekend, though.
We're throwing a huge party at the lake.
I think Leah is gonna be there.
- Yeah, I know.
- I'm sure you do know.
You gonna go ass-grab?
Jesus Christ.
Okay.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'll come for the weekend.
Fuck, yeah!
Just for the weekend, though.
Yeah. It's all you need. Just...
Get right in there and grab that ass.
Jesus.
- It's good to see you, man.
- You too, bro.
Lando!
- How you doing, man?
- How you been?
Hi. You look good. You're good?
You all right? Hey, man. How are you?
- How you been?
- Good.
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.
- Grab a beer.
- Here you go.
Welcome, Lands.
- Thanks, man.
- Say hello, everybody.
- Hey, Brett.
- Brett!
How you doing?
Come over here, you fucking asshole.
Couple of my brothers here.
- Wes.
- Yeah, good to meet you.
So, where you been all summer?
Just had some shit I had to deal with,
back home.
Brad got fucking rolled up on
by some white trash fucking rednecks, man.
Those townie dudes in Dawson
are no joke, man.
They know they got nothing to lose.
These motherfuckers are
literally on their way to jail
and they figure, shit,
they can put you in the hospital
at the same time. All the better, right?
So, what happened?
Just beat my ass, stole my car.
I'm just saying, man, you creep up
on a dude like that behind his back,
you're straight pussy, man.
I'll say this, though.
My boy Brad knows
how to take a fucking punch, man.
Unlike some of us.
What...
Why are you flinching, Baity?
Fuck you.
You piece of shit.
- Baity, why are you flinching?
- I hate all of you.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Do you mind if I sit?
No, no. Please. Got some towel.
Towel here.
I'm really glad you came.
Me, too.
Yeah.
How are you?
I'm good.
Yeah, they found
a fracture in my jaw, though.
I mean, I remember when it happened.
'Cause I could hear it, you know...
I mean, this guy's fist just like...
Kept slamming into my face.
But I remember, I was thinking of you.
What do you mean?
Your last memory of me was
me abandoning you at a party.
- No!
- And...
No, you did not abandon me.
At all. No.
Seriously.
B. You seen my keys?
Shit.
Sorry.
I'm gonna go get another beer, actually.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Cool.
Can of beer. All right.
I thought you said
she had a fucking boyfriend, bro.
You're so drunk right now, aren't you?
Can you just get me another fucking drink?
You...
Just keep your voice down.
Wouldn't want you to drive this way.
That's probably a good idea, buddy.
Probably take a nap
or something like that.
Yeah.
Easy with the fucking mirror, bro.
It's all good, man. We're good.
Yeah, I don't have the keys, bro.
I got it. I got it.
'Cause you had them.
Yeah, here. Right there. Hold on a sec.
- Do you have them?
- Yeah, I got them.
All right.
Okay.
- Hey, Brett. Brett? Hey.
- Yeah? Yeah?
Do you think I'm a pussy?
You're drunk, dude.
Hey, hey.
I don't know why I didn't fight back.
Okay? I don't know.
- I don't know. Okay?
- Okay.
You know, like...
If I had to do it again...
All right. I'm just gonna...
- I'm just gonna get this.
- Okay.
There we go.
I kissed her, you know.
I know. I saw you.
- Don't try to kiss me.
- I won't kiss you.
Just get in the car. You're good.
I'm good. Everything's good.
- That is why you wear glasses.
- Shut up.
I don't know if you remember this.
I didn't look at the fucking sun.
- Fuck you.
- What, did you close your eyes?
I wouldn't be surprised, man.
That's the dumbest game ever.
Could you throw me my hoodie, dude?
When are you driving back?
Next Sunday.
I've been thinking, man. I...
I think I'm gonna go.
Go where?
Like, I think I'm gonna
start school on time.
Brad, that's fucking awesome.
Yeah?
That's...
That's amazing.
- Thank you. Thanks, man. Yeah.
- Yeah.
- You good?
- Yeah, I got it.
Six...
Four.
Dude. This room is way fucking bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.
It's not bad.
All right.
That's a pretty sweet TV.
- Yeah. Good to go.
- Nice.
Hey, what's up, man?
One of you Brad?
I'm your roommate.
Will Fitchley.
But people call me Fitch.
Right on, dude. I'm Brad Land.
It's really good to meet you.
This is my brother, Brett.
What's up, man?
Shit, dude. Are you in Phi Sig?
- I am. Yeah.
- Dude, that's awesome.
So, what's up with rush?
Can anybody come out? Or...
Yeah, of course.
Yeah. We actually
got a party on Saturday.
You should come out. Brad's coming.
Yeah. I will totally be there.
- That sounds awesome, man.
- Cool.
All right. Cool.
We got some more stuff...
Yeah, we got some more boxes, man.
- Good to meet you, bro.
- Yeah, dude.
I'll see you in a second, though, man.
It's good to meet you, Will.
Yeah, good to meet you, too.
Hey, what did I tell you? It's good, right?
It's just fucking chill.
Brett. Brett. It's fucking awesome, dude.
Seriously.
These are some of the best dudes
we'll ever fucking know.
Like, I mean that.
I get it. I got you.
I'm excited. I'm excited you're here.
Good.
What's up, motherfuckers?
Who's this fucking...
Who's this fucking Ellen DeGeneres here?
Dude, that's my fucking roommate.
No!
Fuck, dude. I'm sorry.
Okay.
I'm leaving.
What's up, man? How you doing, dude?
- I'm good, man.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- You feeling all right?
You ready? Hell Week's coming up.
Yeah, I'm ready, man.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Man. I'm not so sure.
Got some hot girls in your dorm?
- One or two. What?
- "One or two."
What are you doing right now?
Where you going?
I'm just going to class.
No, fuck that.
We're going to the bar, brother.
It's kind of early, no?
You're smart enough, man.
Don't be a pussy. Come on.
So, how you been anyway, man?
- I'm good, man.
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'm doing good, I think.
- Yeah.
Fucking trying not to
sleep through class, right?
No, how you been?
How you been since the...
Fucking... Whatever.
Since your accident?
You're gonna be Phi Sig, man. All right?
That shit's never gonna happen again.
First of all, you're never gonna
find yourself in that position again.
Ever.
Yeah, I gotta get in first.
Yeah, you gotta get in.
Yes, you do have to get in first.
Finish that beer, man.
We're doing shots tonight, man.
- You fucking... You serious?
- Me and you, we're doing shots.
We're blacking out tonight, motherfucker.
- Finish that beer.
- When is it?
Phi Sigma Mu, motherfucker!
Yeah, man! Don't stop, motherfucker.
Yes. Yes.
Oh, God.
How you doing?
What?
I think I love you.
- You don't mean that.
- No.
I don't know, I just...
I could love you.
I don't even know you.
Look.
I have to be up really early tomorrow.
I think maybe you should go.
Brad.
Dixon, Brad. Brad, Dixon.
This is my brother I was talking about.
- What's up, Brad? Hey.
- Hey, man.
- One of those?
- Yeah.
Brad, how do you like all the shit so far?
I don't know. It's good times, right?
Right.
So, you're a business major,
like your fag brother here or what?
No.
No, I don't really have a major yet.
I'll probably just wait and see.
Cool. Nice. Good luck with that.
All right, well, I left Chance on the grill.
I got to make sure
he's not fucking the burgers, so...
See you, dude.
- What the fuck was that?
- What?
All that "good times" bullshit?
Bro, they're not gonna let you in here
just 'cause you're my brother. I can't...
Yeah, I fucking know that.
All right. 'Cause they're
weird about that shit.
You need to fucking shake their hand,
look them in the eye,
let them know you want to be here.
All right. What do you fucking
want me to do?
I want you to just have fun.
- Okay.
- And just chill out.
- Okay.
- Right now, though,
take a fucking shot of this.
Some man shit.
Then we're gonna
have a good time, all right?
Come on. Let's go.
There you go. Are you good?
Holy shit. Yeah.
All right.
Who's this up in my motherfucking house?
Shit! Look who it is.
- What's going on, man?
- Chance!
How you doing, brother?
- How are you, brother?
- Man. I'm good.
- You good?
- Good to see you.
Yeah, welcome back. This is Mitch.

Craziest motherfucker

Fuck that, Dad.
Don't call me fucking "dad."

He's back, baby!

Brad got jumped

It's bullshit.
Brad.
That can't fucking happen.
- You hear me?
- Yeah.
You know why?
This is Phi Sigma Mu.
Okay? We're gentlemen.
We don't like to fight,
but if we got to fight, then we all fight.
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Some motherfucker
wants to go through Chance,
they gotta go through all of us.
They wanna fuck with Brett,
they're going through all of us!
It's the same with you.
- Do you hear what I'm saying?
- Yeah.
Punch me in the face.
- What... What?
- Punch me in the fucking face!
- No, dude.

Punch me in the fucking face!

We are brothers till we die!
I don't know. Are you guys sure?
I still think these are too big.
Oh, my God.
Will, relax man. You look fine.
How do you guys feel about Hell Week?
Dude, if one more person asks me
that fucking question...
They're just trying to scare us, man.
I don't know, Baity.
They did say something about a goat.
They're trying to fucking scare us.
Fucking goat.
She's fucking cute, dude.
Have you ever fucking...
Have you ever had sex with a stripper?
No, have you?
All the time.
No, no.
You guys wanna get out of here?
You wanna get out of here?
I have a surprise for you.
All right, you haven't been in here?
- No, dude.
- No, dude.
Pledges aren't allowed
in the fucking legacy room.
You know what else
pledges aren't allowed to do?
Smoke my fucking Cuban cigars.
Shit.
- Holy shit. Is this real?
- Yeah, dude.
My dad gives them to me for my birthday.
Oh, shit.
You got it?
Good?
I'm going places with my life.
We're smart fucking dudes, you know?
Look, we're going to
do shit with our lives.
Big shit.
And these fucking dudes...
I love them,
but they're fucking trashy dudes, man.
They suck.
They're just not going anywhere, man.
Brookman's kind of a shitty school.
No, it's not. It's not.
Stand the fuck up.
This is a celebration.
This is a celebration.
- You're good. You're good.
- No, 'cause we're...
Yeah, man, we got you.
- I've known him my whole life.
- That's true.
- And now we're brothers.
- Fucking brothers.
And now we're brothers forever.
Forever, dude.
You know, my dad...
Fuck that guy, man.
That guy hates my fucking guts.
I'm so fucking glad you guys are here.
I'm fucking glad we're here, too, man.
Yo, you guys...
Dude.
You know, I fucking love you guys.

- I'm good.
Hey.

- Phi Sig for life.
Phi Sigma.
Phi Sigma.
Hello?
Get your ugly goat-ass to the house
in 11 minutes or you're dead.
What?
You started on the wrong foot, goats.
You're all late.
If any one of you are ever late again,
I will rip your shriveled balls off
and shove them down
your fucking esophagus.
Is that understood?
I said, "Is that understood?"
I wanna hear you say, "Sir, yes, sir!"
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.
I am your pledge master.
And you
are my bitches.
Is that understood?
Sir, yes, sir!
Don't you fucking look at them.
You look at me and only me.
When I see Dave Reed,
I don't wanna see Dave fucking Reed.
I wanna see a mesh
of all your faces
in one.
One pledge.
Look at me, goat.
One pledge of the Phi Sigma Mu.
Let me hear your motherfucking pledge!
All my strength is in my union.
All my danger is in discord.
Therefore, be at peace henceforth.
As brothers live together.
Good. Very good.
Welcome to Hell Week, goats!
Now!
Go, go, go, go!
Let's go!
Drink it.
Come on, you fucking faggots.
What the fuck did you swallow?
Go, go, go, go!
Hurry the fuck up.
Drink.
Quick! Drink! Drink! Drink!
Drink.
Drink that shit!
Look at me.
You have no friends.
Nobody's fucking looking out for you.
Nobody fucking loves you.
Say, "I'm a faggot and nobody loves me."
I'm a faggot and nobody loves me.
- Say it again.
- Why the fuck, you ass.
I'm a faggot and nobody likes me.
Say it like you mean it, though.
Say it with feeling.
I'm a faggot and nobody likes me.
Open your fucking mouth!
Turn your head to me right now!
You're gonna drink, motherfucker!
Pushups!
I don't let no
weak motherfuckers in my frat!
Get the fuck up.
Against the fucking wall.
Headstands!
Get your fucking knees up!
Get your fucking knees up!
Spread the fuck out, you faggots.
Get the fuck away from him.
You wanna go on a date with him?
Spread the fuck over!
Get back. Take it, take it, take it.
Are you having a good time?
Sir, no, sir. Sir, no, sir.
On the ground! Face on the ground!
- Just one sip.

You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Get it over here! Hurry the fuck up!
Bring it down. Here we go, Brad.
Sir, no, sir!
Get it, dick-licker.
That was cute.
That's one, you guys.
We got a whole barrel full.
I wanna hear, "Thank you, sir.
May I please have another?"
Thank you, sir.
May I please have another?
Here we go. Nice, cute smiles.
Guantanamo style. There we go.
Got it.
Fitch the bitch.
He's fucking gone.
- You're gonna puke, bro?
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you sure?
- Sir, no, sir.
If you lie to me,
I'm gonna do terrible shit to you.
Sir, no, sir.
That wasn't a question.
All right, motherfucker.
You ready? Don't you puke.
I think he's actually gonna be good.
Not fucking cool.
Get in the cage. Get in the fucking cage.
Get in the cage, now.
Fucker.
Lick that shit off my shirt. Faggot!
Yeah, lock that shit.
That's fucking disgusting, man.
Everybody else, against the wall.
Get against the wall.
Give me that. Give me that.
- Come on.

You thirsty? You thirsty?
You like them golden showers, boy?
Look at those golden showers.
Hey, get that side as well.
Rock a bye, Fitch bitch
Fuck you.
Rock a bye, Fitch
Good night.
Rock a bye, Fitch bitch
Morning, goats.
Time to get the fuck out of our house.
Get the fuck out of our house! Let's go!
Get the fuck up!
Get the fuck out of here!
Brad, get the fuck up!
Get the fuck up!
Let me ask you a question.
What the fuck happened in there?
I don't fucking know, dude.
Okay. Well, Dixon's looking
for a reason to kick your ass out today.
Okay? It's just I cheated for you.
- What?
- This shit cannot happen.
Dude, I didn't fucking
ask for your help in there.
I didn't ask for your help.
Look, I wouldn't do this myself, all right?
They just fucking do this
to weed out the weak ones.
Show them you mean business.
Show them you wanna be here.
Okay.
All right? You got to be tougher.
- You can do this, dude.
- I know. I...
I fucking will be.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Good.
All right.
Hey, man. You all right?
No.
I was gonna go get some pizza
if you want to come.
Okay.
Oh, man. Brad.
I didn't know this happened to you.
Shit, dude.
Sick of feeling scared,
like, all the time, you know.
Hey, I'm sorry
that happened to you, man. It's crazy.
Brad?
Brad?
Bradley?
Wake up!
Get this goat.
You know what goats eat, right?
Goats eat shit.
Go.
What? Go back in your room.
It's time to eat shit, goat motherfucker.
No, no, no, no!
What the fuck, dude!
- Get down.
- Fuck!
Shit. What the fuck are you...
Grab it.
- Grab the...
- Fuck that, dude!
Grab the shit.
Grab it.
You're not leaving
till you taste the shit, bitch.
- Get the...
- Eat.
Get that shit...
It's just a fucking...
You fucking assholes.
Where's your roommate?
Where's Fitch the bitch, man?
I want my goat.
- He's got fucking class, man.
- Yes!
All right. I got to get to class, too.
Just getting started.
You all right?
Yeah.
Thanks, man.
Lando.
What's up, dude?
We're going to the farm. You...
What are you doing?
What's the farm?
What are you talking about?
Getting the fucking goat, dude.
I thought that was a joke.
No, no. Baity found one this year.
It's fucking happening.
Got it. Got it.
Is this pledge getting weirder this year?
Weirder?
I don't know. Harder?
What... Is that a fucking joke?
No, man. It's just...
J-town put a cigarette out on my ass
last year in front of the Tri Delts.
The pledges got to go through hell,
otherwise what's...
What's the fucking point, right?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You're right, man.
All right.
- Hustle, bitches.
- Hurry the fuck up!
You boys are gonna
meet your fucking maker.
Step up! Step up! Step up!
This is just the beginning.
You can't be fucking up this hard.
One too many fucking pancakes.
Move your shit!
You're a fucking goat, man.
All right. Hold up, hold up, hold up.
Jesus Christ, you're fucking ugly.
Good.
Straight fucking line, none of this
crooked fruity bullshit. Let's go.
Straight fucking line.
All right, bitches.
We'll play a little game, okay?
Who was
the first president of the United States?
George Washington, sir.
Wrong! Drink.
Who shot John F. Kennedy?
I...
- I don't know...
- Wrong! Drink.
Fuck.
What are the colors
of the American flag?
Red, white and blue, sir!
Wrong!
Hey, I didn't tell you to fucking drink!
Look at me when I'm talking to you, goat.
I want you to slap Brad in his face.
That's your punishment.
No.
What?
Slap Brad in the fucking face.
Are you deaf?
Slap him in the face.
He won't do it.
Holy fuck!
Are you trying to finger fuck it?
I want you to fucking get in there!
Slap his fucking face!
Jesus Christ!
You're just gonna stand there
and let him slap you in the face?
Your balls drop yet? What the fuck!
There you go. Again!
There you fucking go.
Yeah! Yeah!
There you go.
Okay. The goats are worthy now.
Dixon! Fucking stop, dude.
They did it. They fucking did it, okay?
We're good.
- We're good.
- All right.
You guys are good.
Drink. Both of you.
All right, motherfuckers.
Here's what's gonna happen, okay?
You guys look nervous.
You don't have to be nervous.
This is really simple, okay?
We all did this.
Everybody has to do this, okay?
It's really simple.
Here's what's gonna happen.
First you're gonna fuck him,
and then you're gonna kill him, together.
And then we're all gonna eat him.
You ready to fuck a goat?
You think I'm fucking around?
This isn't bullshit, man.
You ready to fuck a goat?
Take your pants off.
You think I'm fucking around?
Take your pants off.
How are you gonna
fuck a goat with your pants on?
They don't have dicks.
Tell me, Dave. How are you
gonna fuck a goat with your pants on?
I don't know, sir.
You're not.
You're gonna fuck it with your pants off.
Dave's balls are gonna drop today, boys.
You smell like shit.
You guys smell worse than the goat.
Scrub yourself, Dave.
Hey, it's all gonna be worth it.
In the name of Phi Sig, you're cleansed.
Drink out of the fucking bottle.
Go again. Go again.
One more.
A little surprise or a big one?
We got something special in store for you.
That's my limp dick in your fucking face.
You're gonna fucking suck my fucking dick.
Get the fuck out of...
Don't you fucking... Stop!
Don't you fucking push against me!
Come on. Shut the fuck up!
You're good at that.
Suck my fucking dick.
You're good at that.
Look at this fucking faggot.
- You know what's coming?
- A nice little chode.
- You like chodes?
- Does that remind you of high school?
- You like chubs?
- Is that what you did?
Here you go. Come on.
Suck my fucking chode,
you fucking faggot. Come on.
- Open your mouth.
- Fuck this shit, bro.
- "Fuck this shit"?
- Fuck this shit.
Shut the fuck up and suck my dick.
Do it, you fucking pussy!
Come on. Suck my fucking dick.
Phi Sig had a little goat
Little goat, little goat
Phi Sig had a little goat
that you will fuck tonight
Phi Sig had a little goat
Little goat, little goat
Phi Sig had a little goat
that you will fuck tonight
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Get in there. Fucking get in there.
Yeah, lock the fucking door.
All right, you goat fucks.
- On your feet.
- Wake the fuck up.
Let's go. Let's go.
Up against the wall here. Let's go.
Up against the wall.
Get in the corner. Get in the corner.
Turn the fuck around.
That's it.
Looking good.
Look how fucking Lando loves it.
Get him. Go!
Get the fuck up.
Yeah!
Listen up.
You guys have three hours to finish
this keg of fucking warm, delicious beer.
All you gotta do, you gotta
ring that bell when you're done.
Okay?
If you fail,
I can 100 percent promise you
you're gonna have to fuck this goat.
Start the music.
Go!
Fill it up. Fill it up. Fill it up.
Come on, guys.
- Who else? Who else?
- Give me more.
Come on.
Way to go.
I can't fucking...
Do it.
It's fucking tapped.
We tapped it.
It's tapped.
It's tapped!
Two, three...
Yeah!
All right. Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
Listen to your pledge master.
Okay.
You guys just completed Hell Week.
Now you don't have to wear
your pledge shirts anymore.
Thank fucking God,
because you guys fucking stink.
Fuck!
However, you're far from brothers. Okay?
You still have the rest of the semester
to be our little bitches.
As you know, this is your bordelia dochet.
Throw King James out the window.
This is your new bible.
Because of the recent accusations
from our Greek brothers
at the Delta Theta Gamma house,
those fucking pussy-ass retards,
we are obligated to read
a passage from this bitch.
"The bordelia dochet maintains
that hazing is fundamentally at odds
"with the ideals of the Phi Sigma Mu.
"Hazing runs contrary
to our core concepts of brotherhood
"and is prohibited in all forms.
"Any activities intended to produce
harassment, embarrassment, blah blah,
"fuck all, will not be tolerated."
Our initiation is
a rite of passage, gentlemen.
That's all.
Are we clear on that?
Sir, yes, sir.
Okay.
I swear allegiance
to God and in Phi Sigma Mu.
All my strength is in my union.
All my danger is in discord.
Therefore, be at peace henceforth.
And as brothers live together.
You ready?
It was all in good fun, bro.
- Don't worry.
- Sorry.
Tinsley couldn't make it.
Who?
Tinsley, your big brother.
He had, like, a Spanish exam or something.
Where's Brett?
Shit, I don't know. You know Brett.
Good job, man.
Motherfucker. You excited?
I wanna see you smile.
Yeah? There we go.
That's a fucking smile.
Hey, what's up, man?
What's wrong with you?
Nothing, really. It's just...
I don't think they're gonna let me in.
What are you talking about?
Of course you're gonna get in.
We both are.
Why would they give me Chance,
though, you know?
The dude literally hates me.
He said to my face
that I don't belong here.
Fuck him.
It's not his decision, man.
All the brothers vote equally.
I just feel like a pussy.
The dude scares the shit out of me.
Maybe you should just quit.
I can't quit.
Why not?
The same reason you can't quit.
I have no fucking idea why I don't quit.
Yeah, you do. Everybody does.
Dude, if you quit, what else is there?
You know? You're just another guy
that couldn't hack it.
And then, everywhere you go,
everyone's gonna know that.
That's not true.
Bullshit. Yeah, you can't even go to
a party on campus without seeing them.
It's just the way it is.
I'm having sex
for the first time in my life.
You know, I'm not stupid.
Brad, that's not because of me.
You know, if the fraternity goes,
everything goes with it.
Don't give up, man.
Hey, we just got pinned, right?
We're fine. We're fine.
Where you going?
To clear my head.
I'll see you back at the room.
What's up, man?
Hey.
What's your fucking problem, man?
What?
"What"?
Why are you acting like
such a fucking asshole to me?
Whatever, dude.
No, I'm fucking serious, man.
Why, 'cause I didn't feel like coming
to some fucking bullshit ceremony?
Why the fuck was Wes the one
pinning me tonight and not you?
You're lucky it was Wes.
They wanted to give you Dixon
and I stopped them.
What, you think I can't
fucking handle Dixon? Is...
Fuck you, man.
You are un-fucking-believable.
Can you get out of my room now, please?
No. Not until you tell me
what's going on with you.
Nothing's going on. Nothing.
This shit doesn't fucking matter.
That's what you don't get.
Okay? None of this shit matters at all.
This shit fucking matters to me!
- Don't fucking push me.
- What are you gonna do?
You gonna fucking kick my ass?
- I'm not gonna fight you, Brad.
- Why not? Why not?
- Just fucking say it, God damn it!
- 'Cause you don't belong here.
You don't fucking belong here.
This is not for you.
Okay.
- Hey.
- No, that's what I thought.
Give me some room. Give me some room.
Can't let Baity win.
Land, you goat fuck.
You're a dead man.
Get up against the wall.
- No.
- I'm sorry. I think...
There's something in my fucking ear.
What did you say to me?
Fuck you, I'm not doing that.
I'm not asking. You do it,
or you're fucking out of here.
Land, are you being a naughty goat?
Shit!
Head shot, bitches.
100 points. Mark it, Baity, you fat fuck.
Don't just stand there.
- What?
- I think he's really hurt.
You all right, man?
You all right, buddy?
He's fine.
You okay, buddy?
You're a fucking asshole, man.
What the fuck did you
think was gonna happen?
Dude, I'm fine. Dude, it's cool. Come on.
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, dude.
Chill the fuck out, brother.
It's cool.
- Hello?
- Is this Brad Land?
Who is this?
Yeah, this is Detective Burke
with the Dawson Police Department.
Look, I've left you several messages.
We really need you
to come down to the station.
Yeah, yeah. I know. I got your message.
Well, look. I really think we may have
one of the guys that
assaulted you last summer.
Mr. Land? Are you there?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.
Yeah, do you think it would be possible
for you to come today?
Today? No.
Okay. How about tomorrow?
No, I can't.
Brad, listen. I know this is tough. But...
Look, I'm sorry. I just can't.
Brad. What's going on?
Hey. I'll be back.
What's going on, dude?
I got to get back to work.
All right.
The cops found them, Brett. They want
me to fucking come in and ID them.
All right. We'll go back
to Dawson tomorrow.
No, I'm not going.
What do you mean? You have to go back.
No, I can't.
Brad, you have to ID them.
- To fucking punish them.
- No.
Dude, it's taken me six months
to get away from this shit.
I'm not gonna go back now.
Fuck.
I did this.
What? No.
Yeah. I made you fucking come here.
I made you join this fucking fraternity.
- No!
- Yes.
If I would've just
gone home with you that night,
none of this shit would have happened.
What are you talking about?
That doesn't have
anything to do with this shit.
It has to do with you, Brad.
Okay? And how fucked up everything
has been between us since the summer.
I'm not gonna quit the frat, okay?
I'm not letting those guys
lay another fucking hand on you.
Brett.
This is not your decision, okay?
I'm gonna go.
Brad.
Knock, knock.
Errand time, Willie.
Shit. Yeah, I forgot.
What's up?
I need...
I need one egg roll from Yang's Palace.
But not the one on main street, all right?
You gotta go all the way to the airport.
Okay? Don't fuck around.
I can tell the difference.
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
- All right.
You want anything, Baity?
I don't know. Let me see a menu.
How do you pronounce that one?
What are you doing?
Let go of his arms. Let go of his arms.
That's fucking incredible.
You got to go get that egg roll, buddy.
You got an hour.
Go, hustle. Hustle.
Fuck.
What are you doing?
Just cleaning up his shit.
I know. It's crazy, man.
We hardly even knew him, you know.
I knew him.
He was my roommate.
I just feel like
he didn't deserve this, you know.
No, he just had a bad heart, dude.
You wanna stay at the house tonight?
Don't you feel like
that'd be better than being here?
Okay.
Hey, Brad.
Hey, man.
- Hey, man. How you doing?
- Good.
- You doing all right?
- Yeah.
Oh, man.
This must be so hard for you.
I can't even imagine.
I can't fucking imagine, man.
It's been terrible. Buddy, I mean...
Dude, you know,
if you ever want to talk to anybody
or anything like that...
If you ever want to get
anything off your chest,
- you know I'm here for you, right?
- Yeah.
- About anything. I'm here for you.
- Thanks, dude.
Thanks, Chance. Yeah.
Yeah, of course, man.
We're actually doing a little thing.
We're doing a get-together
tonight at the house.
Just brothers only, just to chat.
No drinking or anything. Just to talk.
Just trying to deal
about what we're feeling.
Yeah, I don't think
I can come tonight, Chance.
I just think it's important
that we're all there, man.
That's all. Or else I wouldn't ask.
I just think it's important
that we're with all the brothers.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, all right.
Okay, man. Okay.
Hey, I love you. All right? Hang in there.
- Yeah.
- See you tonight, okay?
- Okay. You, too. Okay.
- I love you.
- Yeah.
- See you tonight.
What's up? Did he call you?
He said the fucking school's
putting us on probation.
What does that mean, man?
What does probation mean?
It doesn't fucking mean anything yet.
Okay? It just means they're
launching an investigation.
We'll all probably have to
go in and, you know,
fucking talk to the provost.
What the fuck?
He wasn't even here. He died on campus.
Yeah, well, someone must have told them
about the concussion. Right, Baity?
No, it wasn't a concussion, man.
We gotta stop saying that.
We need to stop saying that.
He went to the infirmary.
They know that it happened in the house.
- Who's telling them this shit, dude?
- I don't fucking know.
This is serious.
They could kick us out of school.
This is serious.
Okay. I don't know
who's fucking telling them this.
Okay?
- Fuck! Sorry.
- Look...
I'm sorry.
We need to huddle up on this shit.
I know. Yeah.
All right? We can't be telling them
anything that they don't even know.
I'm not gonna fucking lie to them.
If I lose my scholarship,
my dad's gonna fucking kill me.
No one's fucking telling you to lie, Baity.
Look, we haven't been doing anything
that every other fraternity on campus
hasn't been doing for the last...
What?
Fucking a hundred years.
- Yeah, I know, dude. I know.
- A hundred years.
- Right?
- I know.
- Right?
- Yeah. Right.
If you don't have an answer,
just say, "I don't know."
Just keep your fucking mouth shut, Baity.
I'll talk to the pledges.
Hey.
Brad didn't show up to the meet-up.
Come on in, Brad.
How you holding up, Brad?
I'm fine.
You and Will were pledging
together, right?
Yeah. That's right.
What was that like?
I don't know. Just normal stuff.
Were they hazing Will?
Come on, man.
They were beating the crap
out of him, right?
What do you think? I mean...
Just normal pledge term stuff.
You've been here a while.
I mean, I don't understand what...
Right? He was running on the track.
It was a heart attack.
He had bruises all over his body.
He went to the infirmary for
a head injury the week before he died.
Now, it's the school's responsibility
to keep this kind of thing from happening.
It's my duty to make sure
that this kind of behavior stops.
And you know what?
It's your responsibility...
It's my responsibility, it's your duty...
Will's dead. He's dead.
Okay? I don't know what else to tell you.
Brad, just tell me what happened.
Dude. Where have you been, man?
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Okay?
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
What are you talking about?
The fraternity just got suspended
for the rest of the year.
What?
Yeah. Somebody fucking talked, dude.
It's over.
It wasn't you, was it?
No.
I mean, what the fuck was all that for?
Dude, we never even got in.
Dude, I had offers, like, anywhere.
All right?
I could have pledged
anywhere at this school.
I don't even care if it sounds
like bragging at this point.
This is fucked up, dude. All of that for...
Fuck!
Oh, my God!
It's fucking laxatives, dude.
Fuck that, dude.
Fuck!
- Yo, Chance.
- Who the fuck did that?
I don't know what
you're talking about, rat.
- Where's Brett?
- No, no.
You're not talking
to your brother right now.
You're talking to Baity
and you're talking to me.
Okay. Get out of my way.
I need to speak to my brother.
Can I ask you a serious question?
Can I ask you a serious question?
Where do you get the fucking balls
to show your face in this house
after you ratted on me?
I didn't fucking rat on you.
Shit. You're gonna lie to me?
You're gonna fucking lie to me?
We know it was you.
Just fucking admit it.
No.
Admit you're the rat,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.
How about that?
I'm not a fucking rat.
What are you gonna do, dude?
What are you gonna do?
You're gonna lie to me?
What are you gonna do?
- You're gonna lie to me?
- Chance! Chill the fuck out.
No, dude. No. Fuck you.
No, no. Your brother's done, man.
- Leave him alone.
- No, I don't care, man.
He's fucking done.
I love you. But actually
you might wanna go upstairs.
Actually you might wanna go upstairs.
- 'Cause I'm gonna lay in...
- Don't you fucking touch him.
Fuck you, man! I helped his ass
after he got his fucking ass beat.
I got him into this fucking class, man.
I stuck my neck out
for this fucking pussy.
And now, dude, he fucking
ratted on us, man!
Your brother's a rat.
How do you feel about that?
- How do you feel about that?
- No, he's not.
I am.
What?
I fucking told them everything. All right?
What did you say?
This shit doesn't fucking matter.
Okay? None of it.
I don't care anymore.
I just don't fucking care.
It's all fucking bullshit.
Someone's fucking dead.
You're a piece of shit.
- Hold on.
- Don't you fucking touch me.
I'll kick your fucking ass.
- Chill out, bro.
- What you gonna do?
You're a pussy like your faggot brother.
What are you gonna do?
Motherfucker.
Brett, come on.
What the fuck are you doing?
Yo, what the fuck?
- I'm fucking done.
- Come on. Come on.
You okay?
Hey, fellas.
Can I see Brad just for a second?
- How are you?
- Hi.
Hey, listen. Before we go in,
I wanted to show you something.
That's one of the guys, isn't it?
So last week, he makes bail.
That night he goes out
and tries to rob a gas station.
Shot three times in the chest.
The guy's already in there.
Before we go in, though,
I want you to think back on that night.
Any detail you can remember.
Anything about their face,
anything about their body.
Any distinguishing marks
that might help you identify him.
All right?
All right. Let's do this.
Remember. They can't see you.
So just take your time.
When you're ready...
Tell me if you recognize any one of them.
No.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I don't see him here.
Well.
We can actually place one of them
in the vicinity that night.
So are you sure
you don't wanna take your time?
Yeah, I don't see him.
Okay.
Did you let that guy off?
I don't know.
They all look the same, you know.
None of this is your fault, you know.
This is the spot.
