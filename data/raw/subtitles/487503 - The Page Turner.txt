Madame Garnier says
you'll do well tomorrow.
I still find one part hard.
I'm not worried.
I know my daughter.
Whatever she decides, she can do.
What do you think?
Playing should be a pleasure
and I love the way you play.
Thanks, Daddy.
Even if you fail this exam,
we'll carry on paying for your lessons.
No.
Can I play you the whole piece?
Of course.
Later, thank you.
Mélanie Prouvost.
Hello, Mélanie. Go ahead.
You needn't have stopped.
Carry on, dear.
How many more?
Just eighteen.
I've come to see Madame Onfray.
Who are you?
Mélanie Prouvost.
You're Mélanie?
Jacqueline Onfray.
Come in, please.
You'll maintain the database
and the archives.
You'll need to be meticulous
but I'm sure you are. You look it.
Why not take a look?
Let's have lunch together.
There's a good place nearby.
Don't worry, it's on the firm.
- This needs retyping, please.
- Yes, sir.
Sir, this is Mélanie Prouvost,
our new intern.
Nice to meet you. Welcome.
Nice to meet you, sir.
- As soon as you can.
- Yes, sir.
Filing isn't much fun, I know,
but it will give you
an insight into how a law firm works.
Ours has an excellent reputation.
Had you heard of us before applying?
Of course.
I'm the one who processed
the applications.
Your cover letter clinched it.
Plus your excellent high school diploma.
It went well.
Do you know what you want
to do later on?
Not yet,
but this internship means a lot to me.
Hi, Mum.
Fine.
How's Dad?
Everything's fine.
Hi Mélanie.
Everything OK?
Bosses are incredible.
They expect their assistants
to fix everything.
He just asked if my daughter
will be free in November
to look after his son
for the holidays.
Well, I'm sorry.
My daughter's not free.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Come in.
Thanks. We're keeping you very late.
That's OK. My time is my own.
Perfect.
See you tomorrow.
Yes, sir.
I wanted to say...
about November.
Madame Onfray said
you need somebody.
I'll be finished here.
I can watch your son.
I've done it before.
I love children.
But...
Why not?
Good idea.
But it's 25 miles from Paris.
You'd have to move in.
Would you mind?
Splendid.
I'm sure Tristan will be pleased.
My wife, too.
That's a weight off my mind.
- See you tomorrow, Mélanie.
- Yes, sir.
You're Mélanie?
I'm Ariane. This is Tristan, my son.
My husband told me all about you.
In a good sense!
Jean wants to welcome you
before he goes.
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.
I have work to do.
I'll show you around later.
Run along, Tristan.
I need a word with Mélanie.
What about?
Her instructions.
Come.
There's something
I want to tell you before I go.
My wife's a pianist.
She plays in a trio.
They're giving a concert next week.
A very important concert.
You need to know
that two years ago,
she was in a car crash.
Somebody drove into her.
It was a hit-and-run.
Since then, well...
It made her fragile.
She started getting stage fright.
All performers get stage fright
but hers is...
quite crippling.
That's why she needs support.
It's important,
all the time you're here.
You put a lot of trust in me.
I'm sure you'll be happy here.
Has he briefed you?
He likes to control everything.
Off you go.
Don't keep the world waiting!
I'll show you the house.
Tristan took your bags up.
We put in the elevator
for my mother-in-law.
Tristan's practising.
He can be slow
to buckle down, but...
he's very talented.
Do you teach him?
I give concerts. I don't teach.
And it's not good
to teach your own child.
Keep going, dear.
Mélanie will call you for dinner.
My husband's office.
You should put his mail here.
Is that all you wanted to say?
No, it's no problem.
Jean, it's dangerous
to phone and drive.
Love to you, too.
See you this evening.
Bye.
Come in if you like.
You read music?
I used to play the piano.
You gave it up?
That's a pity.
This turn is very hard.
I can't do it myself.
Would you help?
- Looks good!
- Thanks.
We'll see how it turns out.
Do you often cook?
No, but I've often watched.
It's my parents' job, in a way.
What are they?
Butchers.
Listen,
I've just had an idea.
I'm still short of a page turner.
I had a good girl
but she moved away.
Mr Werker, our trio's agent,
sometimes lends me one of his assistants
who reads music,
but it's always potluck.
Playing, you're vulnerable.
The person beside you sustains you.
Would you turn for me
at our next concert?
We could practise together.
During your working hours,
of course.
Okay.
You'd have to enjoy it.
I do enjoy it.
Good. I'm glad.
- I'll get Tristan.
- He's downstairs.
Did you know
Mélanie plays the piano?
Do you?
I did, a long time ago.
Well, she reads music perfectly.
She's turning for me
at the radio concert.
Big responsibility!
A turner
can throw everything off balance.
Horowitz said it, not me.
He knew all about it.
I remember three years ago
at the Theatre Royal in Brussels.
They found a turner
at the last minute.
A professional pianist, supposedly.
Forgive me,
it wasn't your best concert.
Mélanie will be great.
I can feel it.
See what happens
when you marry a top lawyer?
I sometimes feel like I'm on trial.
A top lawyer
can still be in love with his wife.
And admire her.
What's wrong?
- We're off the piano.
- Back to 66.
Can't you see I'm off the beat?
You did it at our last concert, too.
I was off form.
Stop it, Laurent.
- You know I'm right.
- You're wrong to get angry!
It's pointless. Give me an A.
You're a pianist?
Yes... but not any more.
I played when I was a child.
You stopped?
That's a pity.
You could start again.
Ariane could help you.
I could give you some tips.
I started out as a pianist.
Is this a big thing?
- Your radio concert.
- Yes, it is.
It's our agent's
final test of faith in us.
If we stop, Virginie and I
will be OK. We have other work.
Your turner looks nice.
Where did you find her?
Interning for Jean.
At the moment, I need...
Support?
I'm going to ask her
to turn at the concert.
It's a little risky but...
She's quite at ease.
She reassures me.
Notice how she watches you?
How?
Intently.
Good shot!
- What is it?
- A Bach prelude.
The only part I can play.
It's nice.
Got the music?
Can you play the rest?
- You know your mother loves Bach?
- Dad, too.
Why not give them a surprise?
Mum says
playing too difficult things
can damage your muscles.
You can get tendonitis.
- How fast, do you think?
- To the 1/4 note?
120?
More like 140?
I can't play that fast!
Yes you can.
It's worth the effort.
Just raise the speed
a little every day.
You'll make 140. If you try.
But it's a secret. OK?
Not a word.
You're ready?
Not me. I can't stop.
It takes me longer every time.
Which do you prefer?
That one.
You're right.
You don't wear much make-up.
It's nice and... light.
I'd like to wear more
but I only like good quality
and it's very expensive.
Do you know this?
It's fabulous.
Wait.
Take it.
No, please.
It feels nice.
Yes, very.
Careful...
Feeling OK?
Everything OK?
I'll take a few questions,
then over to you.
Come.
This trio by Shostakovich
isn't their usual repertoire.
But I have every confidence.
The Anima Trio has matured.
The audience will love
this marvellous performance.
Without further ado,
let's hear Shostakovich's Trio No 2
performed by the Anima Trio.
I'm delighted to welcome violinist
Virginie Chalter,
cellist Laurent Chalter,
and on the piano,
Ariane Fouchécourt.
It was wonderful! Marvellous!
Ariane, you gave me the shivers.
Truly!
Thanks.
Well done.
I'm bowled over.
Champagne time!
You've earned it.
So have we.
I think you're wanted
for an autograph.
- Your first name?
- Anna.
Are you OK?
Won't you come with us?
Thanks for what you did.
Your support.
Ariane, there you are.
I'm proposing
to present the trio to McGuerman
next week.
Many of my artists
will be green with envy.
Why not play here?
What's a little extra work?
How about it, my dear?
- You'll still be away.
- True, but...
Mélanie, you'll be here, right?
- Yes.
- Splendid.
You've found the perfect turner.
Yes.
Isn't she pretty?
Is she yours?
I raised her.
What's her name?
"Jealous."
People used to treat
black hens like witches.
They tortured them
and burned them.
My grandmother told me.
Did she do it?
She cut their throats.
Look.
You cut a hen's throat here.
Found you!
- Lunch time.
- Not yet!
Mum,
you never play with me.
My turn to count!
Found you!
Come on, let's eat.
I have a pain here.
Don't worry, it happens.
It's a secret.
Not a word.
What's a secret?
What's a secret?
For your husband's homecoming,
Tristan has prepared something
on the piano.
Don't tell me, then.
I like my son
to have secrets like that.
I won't say anything.
Why not see if that's your father?
What's Laurent doing?
Did you notice? Ariane always
gets it wrong at the first turn.
It's not your fault.
You turn beautifully
but maybe you could tell her.
Let me show you.
Here.
See? G - F - E - D...
What happened?
A musical instrument...
A cello.
Is it very painful?
Lost much blood?
We'll soon have you comfortable.
Is our concert for the American
still on?
Are you up for it?
I was going to tell you.
We've postponed it by two days.
Laurent will be up.
Is it wise?
Will the doctors allow it?
Of course they will!
They'll give him morphine.
It's our only chance
before the American takes off again.
It was close.
A whisker away from disaster.
How on earth did he do it?
I've no idea.
Cellos are heavy. He said he
lifted it up to retract the spike...
It slipped, I suppose.
His memory's clouded by the shock...
but I've never heard
of such an accident.
Can we talk about your turner?
I don't feel good about her.
We have to be at our best
for the American.
And thanks to Mélanie, we will be.
If she hadn't been
at the radio concert...
I've never found anyone like her.
Nobody's irreplaceable.
We're not changing her now!
OK. But now you know how I feel.
Yes. Thanks!
Twenty-one. Not bad.
Again.
21...
22...
23...
See?
You beat your record.
My love,
the joy of seeing your face
in that crowd!
Thank you
for finding the time to come.
That evening, I played for you.
Mum, how are you?
Can you put Dad on?
Yes, I'm fine.
Everything's OK.
Everything's fine, don't worry.
This one's pretty.
Can I help you?
We need a dress for a concert.
Can I try it on?
Right over there.
Mathias!
How are you doing?
- Long time no see.
- It's been ages!
What's up? Are you free at all?
I have a job,
but not for long.
Want to come kayaking?
You're still into that?
Doesn't it show?
Yeah, not bad!
You're as pretty as ever.
- I have to go.
- Really? Call me.
That was Mathias, a friend.
Hello, Monique.
Am I late?
Not at all. I'm always ready
hours ahead of a concert.
Have you met Mélanie?
She's filling in for Ingrid.
Dinner's in the fridge.
It's a short concert.
We won't be late.
Not to worry.
Give me a kiss.
Bye, darling.
Mum,
you're beautiful.
Thanks.
I think so too.
Have you seen Mélanie?
I'll go get them.
Any luck?
Relax, we'll find someone else.
No way!
- Will you turn your own pages?
- It has to be Mélanie.
Hello everybody.
Ready to go?
The page turner's gone.
Never mind.
My assistants read music.
One of them will do.
No! I know your assistants.
They always mess up.
McGuerman is waiting!
He can come again.
Listen.
You're a great pianist.
We all know it.
The page turner makes no difference.
It's going to be fine.
All you need do is play.
Let yourself go.
Sorry.
Werker called. He's letting us go.
He won't give us any more concerts.
What does Jean think?
What?
Your husband.
Did you tell him about the concert?
All I told him was...
we're resting
after Laurent's accident.
He takes my career to heart.
Don't you?
Of course I do.
What's the matter?
What's up with you?
I don't know.
Really?
- What do you mean?
- You really don't know?
No.
We can talk.
It's what friends are for.
- About what?
- About what's up with you.
Do you know?
Yes.
I think so.
Is it Mélanie?
I don't know.
It's important
to recognise your feelings.
I have no feelings!
I've no right to.
There's a difference.
OK!
Sorry.
I'm married, I have a child...
If Jean heard anything,
he'd push me out.
None of this is mine.
It's all his, from his family.
He won't hear anything.
Don't worry. I won't say a word.
When is she leaving?
Tomorrow.
We're giving her a farewell dinner.
Toast's ready.
Careful, it's hot.
I've had it since I was little.
I'd like you to have it.
I'm embarrassed.
I have nothing for you.
Don't worry.
But... there's one thing
I'd like to ask you for.
You'll think it's weird.
Go on.
I'd like your autograph.
Sure, if you want.
I'd like that.
Me too.
But I haven't a photo...
I have.
I'll find one.
Thanks.
Here's to you. To your stay here.
I was lucky.
Tristan's a very special boy.
Don't flatter him!
I mean it.
Tomorrow I'll make breakfast.
You can lie in.
Tristan will wake you up.
I'll drive you to the station.
Then Jean will come back.
Mélanie, I want to see you again.
Mélanie, I want to see you again.
I love you.
You've given me a new life.
- Morning, dear.
- Morning, Mum.
How about waking Mélanie up?
She already left.
I heard her this morning.
She can't have.
I'm driving her to the station.
For your collection.
I missed you both.
How's your cellist?
Is the trio back in action?
Yes... I mean soon.
Tristan's the pianist
of the house for now.
He has a surprise for us.
I've overheard things.
Right, Tristan?
Has Mélanie left already?
She left earlier.
Come and warm up for the surprise.
I'll help you.
What's the matter?
I have a pain.
Where?
In my arm.
You have to play for your father.
He needs to see your progress.
Here he is. You can begin.
