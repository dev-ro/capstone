Once, I was on top of the worId.
I was a major-Ieague hedonist
and Iived Iike god in Amsterdam.
What couId go wrong?
A Woman Goes to the Doctor
An ode to Iove
PART ONE
STIJN & CARmEN
I was hard at work one day
when she waIked in.
The most beautifuI woman in the
western hemisphere, and far beyond.
Yes, wow! Scored!
So we buy the best Dutch commerciaIs...
...and seII them to foreign companies.
That way we aII make money off it.
- Great idea.
Who came up with that idea?
- me.
You?
And why?
- Because of types Iike you.
Types Iike me?
I'm sure you think your cIients shouId have
a huge portrait of you on their waII.
Stijn van Diepen...
from Brabant, I assume?
Yes... Breda. In the south of HoIIand.
Breda?
- A smaII town, 500 km north of Paris.
And you? Where are you from?
- Amsterdam.
So you're a reaI Amsterdammer
who thinks the worId is fIat.
Leave the city
and you'II faII off the edge.
A IittIe bit, yes.
But, you wouIdn't faII off.
I'd save you.
Barry maniIow?
Or mozart?
- That's an easy one. Barry maniIow.
Stijn!
- What?
Come on!
- Wait.
Rock on!
Best day of the year?
In February, of course...carnivaI.
ReaIIy.
- CarnivaI?
Anything goes. Anything you Iike.
So I'm not scared of anything,
anything is possibIe.
One cup. ReaIIy.
I'm so thirsty. ReaIIy.
No, wait!
How do you Iike your tea?
I want to marry her.
- You? marry?
Stijn, I don't think that's a good idea.
- But I Iove her!
And I want a chiId from her!
For better, for worse!
In sickness and in heaIth.
UntiI death do you part.
- I do.
my wife had a passion for Iife.
Life was a party. Every day.
Apart from that one day...
Bastard!
You fucked Sharon
with the droopy tits?! Gross.
How often.
- WeII, twice?
Twice?!
You and your two times.
BuIIshit, Stijn. How often?
- Carmen!
We onIyjust moved in together!
What's wrong with you?
I onIy Iove you. She was
some ugIy chick. No, don't!
I wiII!
- Stop, stop!
From then on,
Carmen knew I'd never be faithfuI.
She decided to toIerate my cheating
as a bad habit.
One guy picks his nose,
another cheats. Something Iike that.
Branding at Work, this is Frank.
I started an ad agency with Frank.
''Branding at Work''.
The money poured in. Buckets of it.
No: by the container Ioad.
We moved to AmsteIveen.
I hate AmsteIveen.
Hey Stijn! CongratuIations!
This is briIIiant!
The reason for buying a house with a yard
made up for a Iot: Luna, Iight of my Iife.
FortunateIy Frank and I
reguIarIy went abroad on business...
...Iooking for inspiration...
...maintaining contact with cIients...
...and generating new business.
Women couId touch me anywhere,
except my heart.
my heart beIonged to Carmen.
Frank's my best friend,
but with the opposite Iibido.
He's not interested in fucking.
That seems to exist.
This is Ramon. The same breed as me.
I had everything under controI...
Where were you?
- LosAngeIes.
Okay.
Shit! Stop. Stop now!
Stijn, text message!
What?
- Text message!
Some guy Frank.
- What does he say?
''Look in your Ieft pocket.''
There's another message.
''I mean your right pocket...''
''Stijn, Stijn. Don't do it anymore.''
I had everything under controI.
Hey! Here we are again.
Hi gorgeous...
I missed you, you know.
Hey, what's up?
I spoke to the doctor about my breast.
We have to go by. It's reaIIy not good.
It's maIignant.
We'II have to investigate
the best treatment.
We have to test Iungs, Iiver,
Iymph gIands, and then decide...
...which chemo to use...
...at which intervaIs...
...how much time in between.
That depends on your condition.
We need to know how progressive it is.
maybe I'II go baId.
AII over?
It's so strange. I don't feeI iII.
There'sjust something in my breast...
...that's bad and I can't controI it.
That's so weird.
Lymph gIands?
- Lymphyes, test my Iymphs.
And then they can see
what the next step is.
Whether that's chemo
or whatever...
Carmen is so strong...
- Anyone for bubbIy?
Come on, guys!
She's not going to die!
It doesn't Iook good.
InfIammatory breast cancer.
But we can try severaI techniques.
- 2/3rds survive, don't they?
Who says so?
- It's on Internet!
SurvivaI rates are Iower
for this type of cancer.
Can't you just remove it?
Take my breast off.
The tumour's too big and we can't see
how the ceIIs have spread.
We have to start chemo
as soon as possibIe...
...and then we'II see...
What a nice pIace...
Good morning! I'm Jeanine.
- Carmen.
Hi, I'm Stijn...
- Today's the big day. It won't take Iong.
Your arteries Iie very deep.
Chemo was no fun, but I'd promised
Carmen I'd be there, every time.
She was reIieved and said it was sweet of
me to want to come.
''Want'' isn't the right word.
The onIy thing I wanted Iess
was for her to go aIone.
You don't want to give it a kiss?
I'II give it a kiss...
He was about to give it a kiss
when he jumped on its head...
Carmen, it's onIy work!
Sweetheart...
Okay?
Here we go...
If you think about it, it's briIIiant.
Like so many good ideas,
why wasn't it done before?
Anyway, one day Carmen came in
and opened our eyes.
We're going to watch a presentation.
Carmen wiII provide a brief introduction.
Carmen?
Good morning.
This commerciaI was conceived
by Branding at Work...
...and was very successfuI
in the BeneIux.
The campaign has aIready ended.
The fiIm has been in a drawer
for two years.
Let's Iook at the fiIm.
- Yes.
No one can see it.
Are you sure?
- Francois, get cutting.
VoiIa!
Fuck...
It Iooks pretty good from this side.
- Wash and wave, pIease?
I'II see what we can do, madam.
So ugIy...
Sorry...
There's mum.
HeIIo, darIing.
Don't be scared, sweetie.
mummy's wearing a hat now, you see?
Look. Isn't that weird?
- She's Iike a hedgehog! See?
You want to feeI?
- Come on, just feeI.
It's a IittIe prickIy.
- Does it feeI strange?
Here it comes.
Shake it about...
Isn't that strange?
- Isn't it IoveIy?
You want to feeI again?
You want to feeI my hair?
- Go on, it's soft!
No? Is it a bit scary?
Hey Luna!
Okay, for Frank?
- WeII...
Okay then. mariIyn monroe!
New hair?
- Yes.
Pretty, isn't it.
It sure is!
It itches Iike mad!
- It does?
Yes.
- But bIonde Iooks good on you.
Thank you.
- It's better.
What?
Dr ScheItema was satisfied
with the resuIt of the four chemos.
She finaIIy beIieved what I'd said
for months. my Carmen is stronger...
...than that cancer.
HaIf-time: Cancer 0 - Carmen 1 !
Now we are ready for the second haIf!
RADIATION
Here you go...
Come on, mrs van Diepen.
Radiation.
A precision bombing of the tumour.
The way TV showed Americans
bIowing up buiIdings in Iraq...
...and then 28 times.
Start at the bottom?
- I'II say stop.
Here we go.
It's gIued tight.
- Yes.
Okay?
Yes, it doesn't hurt as much.
I'm just going into town for a bit.
- Okay.
meet CaroI... meet Esther.
I toId you about Stijn.
CaroI?
So you must be Esther.
5missedcalls from Carmen
Take it easy...
Are you okay?
I'II get a toweI?
CaIm down.
If he touches your tits,
I'II beat him up.
I onIy operate if I'm sure
it increases the chance of survivaI.
I'm afraid we can't save the breast
in your case.
Don't underestimate amputation.
You're a beautifuI woman. Young...
It Ieaves you maimed. After treatment
we can use cosmetic surgery...
...and an impIant
to make a new breast.
UntiI then, you can use a prosthesis.
I think we have to do it.
I can do the surgery nine days from now.
Soon you'II onIy have one.
I'd rather have you with one tit
than not at aII.
But you're a titty man.
I'm afraid.
AmPUTATION
No compIications. It's heaIing weII.
I'II Ieave you two aIone.
They say the foIds wiII fade.
It's ugIy, isn't it?
WeII, it's not reaIIy... pretty. No.
No, it's not reaIIy pretty!
Good afternoon. How did it go?
WeII, Frank. It was fun.
We Iaughed our heads off.
How is Carmen?
- WeII, just great!
Stijn, the papers for...
- Later. What?
Sign this?
- Fine. The cIient okayed the budget?
No, I haven't heard.
- Dammit! Then caII them! Christ!
Do I have to do everything
in this fucking pIace?!
New Year's Eve.
'Change of the sexes': Frank's idea.
He thought peopIe wouId Ioosen up.
We needed that.
Our Iife had become a cancer.
The king and queen hedonists
had changed into patient and caregiver.
Our days consisted of hospitaIs,
puke, drying tears...
...and cIeaning burns.
Carmen thought
Frank's idea was perfect.
For the first time in months
she was free. Free of cancer...
...and free of me.
Ten, nine, eight...
...seven, six, five, four...
...three, two, one...
Zero!
Happy New Hair!
Be honest. Say how you feeI.
- I want a carefree evening.
I don't want to be pitied by peopIe.
''There's the girI with cancer.''
- They don't say that.
It's no fun!
Come on, you want to
put on a show aII evening?
Leave me aIone, man!
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?
What about me? ShouId I sit there
and show peopIe my scar?
Am I afraid to die?
Yes, of course I am!
I think about it every day!
Of course I'm scared of dying!
Hey! You're not going to die!
You're going to fight!
You don't know
what it's Iike to be afraid.
I'm terrified aII day...
- Get in the car!
Leave me aIone!
Carmen, get in the car, now.
- Leave me aIone, man!
Carmen, pIease Stop!
- Look at my cancer head!
Stop, stop.
Just Iook at my cancer head.
Sorry...
It's going ahead, we booked.
The whoIe office is going to New York.
A week's fareweII trip.
Nice pIan!
- Sure...
I'm gIad I don't have to work
for a whiIe.
You?
I'II be gIad when our Iife
is back to normaI.
Carmen and I stiII enjoyed Iife...
...but not together.
PART 2 - STIJN & CARmEN
and STIJN & ROSE
Every year, I see her and
faII in Iove with her at carnivaI.
Every year, she rejects me
with a smiIe.
Rose from Amsterdam!
Going to hit on me again?
I wouIdn't dare. You hate wedding rings.
- That's true.
We couId chat.
Chat?
It won't get any more
pIatonic than that!
Hello Tiger.
Platonic drink on Friday?
Stijn...
Come on, we must go.
Stijn! Come on, we're going.
Yes, I'm coming!
- We're aIready Iate.
Good evening, madam.
Good evening, sir.
Nice of you to come.
WeIcome to our...Iair.
Do peopIe work here?
- Yes, usuaIIy.
What do they do?
- I can expIain that.
most peopIe who Iearn a reaI trade
make things.
We make hours, not things.
At Ieast, I hire peopIe to.
Young dogs, just as fanaticaI
as I was in the past when...
...pIaying soccer.
- The picture on your right...
...depicts my cIub's gIorious past.
The Iast game in Amsterdam's
beautifuI OIympic Stadium.
This Champions League match
didn't work out.
Nice...
Wow, wait a second.
No, no, no.
I fear I have to move you definitiveIy
from my ''to do'' tray to my pIatonic tray.
You're the one who's married.
If I can handIe it, there's no probIem.
This was a waste of time.
What was I thinking?
This has to stop. Now.
ShaII we have a bite to eat?
TeII me something about your wife.
Not another ''my wife doesn't
understand me'' story...
No, not reaIIy.
It's more a story about cancer.
Carmen has breast cancer.
It started with chemotherapy:
4 courses, every 3 weeks.
And every time, she had to puke
for days untiI onIy biIe came up.
She Iost 10 kg.
Her hair feII out, she turned baId.
Then the radiation...
We had to be happy
when her breast was amputated.
It Ieft a huge hoIe. Agigantic scar.
A six-inch zipper.
It was terribIe, heII.
Not to mention nightmares
about death, being Ieft aIone...
...my daughter motherIess.
Carmen is a beautifuI woman
devastated by cancer. HumiIiated.
We've aII been humiIiated by cancer.
So whether she understands me...
that isn't the point.
Carmen?
Come on...
Let's dance.
AIready asIeep?
How's New York?
Luna's fast asIeep.
No, it's 4 am here.
I just got home. I went into town.
Time for bed.
I miss you.
HeIIo?
Good morning, madam!
- Good morning.
I shouId have gone home earIier.
maybe, but I'm the one
who's married, remember?
I'm the one who doesn't want
an affair with a married man.
Wait a sec.
Wait, the doorbeII.
HeIIo?
HeIIo?
Rose gave me what I Iacked at home.
my Iust for Iife, part-time.
I have to go to the office.
AdeadIine. I'II see you Iater. Okay?
She was the woman I needed now.
Rose became my surrogate queen.
AII the cIichés about cheating came up.
...and we've been there...
Sorry, I have
a dentaI appointment, okay?
The deaI you make is to seII the shares
you buy on the same day.
And you'II earn money?
- Enough to paint, anyway.
That's cIever.
You okay?
What?
AII that turmoiI.
Carmen is reaIIy... incredibIy strong.
Your Iife is chaotic now.
That's no good for Carmen either.
You're heading for troubIe.
Hey Picasso, when are you going to
mess up my canvas?
mess up?
- What?
Is that what you think of my work?
I mean we aII mess things up
aII over the pIace, don't we?
Then came the news we wanted. The
chemos, the radiation, the amputation...
...had worked.
We'd won the battIe against cancer.
It's so unreaI.
After everything they did to you?
- Here you are.
OnIy a genius cancer ceII
can survive aII that!
I'm cIean!
So why aren't we dancing on the tabIe?
Why aren't we going wiId?
It's as if that fucking chemo
numbed me. I don't feeI a thing.
Carmen, it'II come back. ReaIIy.
It'II be okay!
Let's enjoy the moment!
Here and now.
Carpe diem...
Here's to you.
Who's that?
Boris...
Boris?
- He's that new kid at the office.
Let's enjoy the moment.
Here and now.
Sorry, we have a deadIine,
I have to take it.
I miss you too, reaIIy!
I can't taIk,
but I'II caII you Iater, okay?
Two hours...
Who wants a fried egg?
- me!
You want a nice fried egg?
- Yes!
morning, dear.
- Good morning.
Was it nice with Ramon?
- Yes, great.
It was?
- Yes, it was great.
You see, Ramon caIIed to ask
where you were.
WiII you be back earIy?
I'd Iike you to take me to the airport.
Do we have a future?
I want to know
if you want to be with me.
You think about it.
WhiIe Carmen was away,
Branding at Work won our first major award.
The UEFA Cup for advertising.
The office had a coIIective orgasm.
Isn't it ugIy?!
- No.
Bah! That's ugIy!
Are you okay, Stijn?
What's her name?
Rose.
Want to know more?
Yes.
- Frank, I stopped Ioving her, get it?
You don't know. Even now it's better,
Carmen isn't the same woman.
I need Rose's Iove.
- You're confusing Iove and happiness.
You're not happy with Carmen,
but you Iove her.
But I'm having an affair!
You don't need to be a psychiatrist
to see that something is wrong.
Rose has nothing to do
with your feeIings for Carmen.
I hope Rose gives you what you need,
but you can't treat Carmen Iike this!
You have to be honest, taIk to each
other, hoIiday together, man!
Hey, go on hoIiday!
Say what you just toId me!
- If I do, I'm afraid it's over.
Just Iisten to yourseIf.
You say you no Ionger Iove her?!
If you go on, you Iose everything.
Not just Carmen.
You've got something great going.
Luna. Think of Luna.
lt'sgot to stop, Rose.
Sorry. lcan'tgo on.
This is beautifuI!
I'm going for a swim.
Does she have nice tits?
- Nice tits? Who?
Boris!
He texted that he misses you.
Have you stopped?
- Yes, it's over.
What are we doing here? We fIew
36 hours to be in this beautifuI spot.
I don't understand. Is it over?!
I want to know if we're stiII together.
I have to know, because I don't feeI it!
Can you Iook me in the eye
and say you Iove me?
Of course.
Go on then.
I want a divorce.
Let's get pissed, we're here anyway.
Truth or Dare?
Come on Join in!
I reaIIy won't mention mr B.
- Dare...
Oh. Truth is too hard for you?
- Okay. Truth then?
Boris...
- ReaIIy. Let's keep this fun.
Okay.
Joyce?
Twice.
I knew it!
You are reaIIy disgusting!
Joyce, with those...
Yes, okay. Your turn.
Truth or Dare?
- Dare.
Kiss me.
Truth.
And you?
What do you mean?
- Cheated?
Who did I cheat with?
- Did you cheat then?
No, I snogged a guy
at a street party.
Kissed him? OnIy kissed him?
- Yes?
You didn't...
- No.
But I did do it with Pim.
- With Pim?
Yes.
- When?
When you were in ThaiIand.
- At our pIace?
At home, in the car, in the bathroom.
- You're not serious!
AII on one night?
You were away for four weeks.
Your turn.
Truth.
- How often?
maybe more than
the fingers on one hand.
Okay, two hands.
Five hands, bastard!
I suppose Frank knows everything?
I'm gIad we're divorcing.
Good morning!
Do you want to be my wife again?
my sweet Stijn...
I don't know.
I Iiked us more divorced Iast night
than married aII year.
For better or for worse!
In sickness and in heaIth.
UntiI death us do part?
Can you Iive with this?
Yes.
You must promise me one thing.
That you won't cheat on me anymore.
Do you promise?
Our new Iife without cares or cheating
Iasted one week. She briefIy Iived happiIy.
Stijn!
It's not very good.
A metastasis of 4 by 4 centimeters
on top of the Iiver.
Is that a secondary?
To be honest, a new chemo
wiII onIy deIay.
If it takes, you may have...
...six months, maybe Iess.
WiII I be in pain?
- No, pretty sure you won't be.
Your Iiver wiII faiI
so you'II have Iess energy...
...you'II sIeep more and go into a coma.
It's very humane.
That's positive, at Ieast.
But you wiII have the side-effects
of the chemo.
Nausea, fatigue, hair Ioss, Ioss of...
...taste and smeII and
your muscIes wiII aIso protest.
The inside of your paIms too.
It may sound strange,
but I feeI reIieved.
Now we know: I'm dying.
- Carmen, don't say that.
I knew it from the start.
I just knew it.
We'II do this together, right?
We both stopped working. Carmen
made a Iist of pIaces she wanted to visit.
We took the best hoteIs
and recorded it aII for Luna.
We wanted Luna to see more images
of her mother than any other chiId.
I'm going to get you!
''Carpe Diem'' was our new motto.
If we couIdn't add days to Iife...
...we had to add Iife to the days.
We reveIIed in each other
and in every day we had together.
Stijn and Carmen as the
worId champions of hedonism.
AnkIe-breakers!
Okay... You can scream, scream.
Now drive me home.
You have to put me to bed.
Okay?
Try... before you die.
Some water, water, water.
I have the director's cut in my head. Luna
wouIdn't have Iiked the deIeted scenes.
She'II have to make do
with the PG-rated version.
Can you turn Ieft?
- What?
Turn Ieft here?
Here?
- Yes.
Let's find a nice spot.
I can't park here, that...
Damn...
This is an answering machine...
Hey, Rose. It's me.
Carmen is dying.
She's incredibIy strong, but...
I have to see you.
Sorry, your veins Iie so deep...
I want a reaI doctor.
- Hey Stijn, caIm down!
No, you're no guinea pig.
A reaI doctor!
Stijn! Stijn... Stop it!
- Leave her aIone!
Rose!!
Don't do this anymore, Stijn.
Sorry.
That's not what I mean.
What then?
Not caIIing for so Iong.
Sorry.
I Iove you, Stijn.
I broke my promise to Carmen.
It Ieaves a Iot to be desired...
...but Iove has its own ruIes
in times of cancer.
I was even more addicted to
Rose than Iast time.
I wanted to be with her
every spare second.
Where is Carmen van Diepen?
She's Ieft.
my sweet Iove.
my diary suffered from
inhuman time management.
I'm coming.
I'II be back Iater.
No you won't.
- I promise. I'II be back.
Just stay right here, okay?
Hey, big girI.
Breathe deepIy...
Sorry Goddess, I...
...I didn't come back.
But...I'II make it up to you. ReaIIy.
I'II wake you Iater with kisses.
I'm sorry.
What do you want?
Do you want to end it?
DarIing, if there's anything.
I'm home in 15 minutes.
Stijn.
WouId you pIease stay here?
DarIing, I'm meeting Ramon
for a beer in 10 minutes time.
I was Iooking forward to a night out.
One beer with Ramon.
With Ramon...?
What is this? Come on.
Carmen, stop it.
I go everywhere. Chemo, radiation.
I fight with the doctors for you.
I caII them in the middIe of the night.
I do everything!
For better and for worse...
Remember, Stijn?
Yes, go on, go on. Get Iost, get Iost!
Go fuck a woman whiIe I'm dying here!
I don't need you, you bastard!
1 8 months misery.
HospitaIs, chemotherapy.
Tears, puke and you don't need me
anymore now?!
Fuck you and your cancer,
Carmen van Diepen.
One more time.
in the moonlight
Where were you?
With someone eIse.
mum's mad at you.
So I'm mad at you too.
mum's mad at you.
So I'm mad at you too.
mum's mad at you.
So I'm mad at you too.
mum's mad at you.
So I'm mad at you too.
mum's mad at you.
So I'm mad at you too.
I'm not mad at you anymore.
WiII you Iive here with us
untiI death us do part?
She keeps vomiting. OnIy biIe.
Is she in pain?
- Yes.
I'II Ieave some morphine
so you won't be in pain.
It might make you haIIucinate.
- Oh, that sounds great!
At Ieast I'II see something.
Bye, Tom.
It's no use, Stijn.
If it goes on Iike this, I've had enough.
I want to know how things work
when I'd had enough.
I'II ask the doctor how it aII works.
Come on, Iet's take a picture.
Come and sit here.
I need a pee.
I'm going to the bathroom.
ShouId I heIp?
Sorry guys, we need a bathroom break.
We'II be right back with you.
my darIing Iove.
Is there anything?
Is there anything
you want to know?
No.
No. It's okay.
I know what I need to know.
As Iong as you're happy...
...with any woman you Iike.
It's okay.
Dammit!
Stijn...
I've had enough.
- Wait a sec.
Come on...
Sorry...
It's okay, darIing. Just Iet it run...
I thought we'd tried everything in bed,
but not this.
It's okay.
You can't keep this up.
Don't worry about me. It's okay.
I don't want this. I've had enough.
I don't want this anymore.
I'm just Iike a baby.
It can onIy get worse.
I can't cope with this anymore.
I want to end it tomorrow.
Look, Luna.
You see that chest?
