Is this Reposete?
- Yes.
Please get the bags:
a satchel and two suitcases.
Yes, sir. Give me a hand.
We'll see if I can hire a
carriage from here.       - Yes.
Go on home, then. Bon voyage.
Let's go.
Is the gentleman coming
to the boarding school?
Would you please announce us?
- Yes.
Easy, boy. Take it easy.

Miss Lacienne -
you don't feel like writing?
No... Not especially.
You find dictation boring?
As well as the company
of your classmates?
Perhaps you’d prefer to spend a
week in the discipline chamber? Hmm?
You remember your
experience there, right?
Would like you like to return?
Whatever you wish.
No. Whatever you
wish, Miss Lacienne.
I don't care.
I doubt that.
Do as you please.
Very well. We'll see
about that. Miss Toupain?
Yes, Madam?
Please accompany Miss Lacienne to the
discipline chamber and return immediately.
Take the key.
Miss Lacienne.
May I go alone?
- No.
No doubt I'll see you later?
- Yes, we'll have a talk.
Let's continue.
"In response to his many critics...
"In response to
his many critics, Molière..."
A gentleman has arrived with a girl.
They are in the library.
Girls... Mlle. Desprez
will finish the dictation.
Miss Noel, is it
too much trouble to stand up?
Forgive me, Madam Fourneau.
Give me that key!
Mr. Baldie?
- Madam?
I am Madam Fourneau,
director of the boarding school.
How can I help you?
Pleased to meet you, Madam.
This is Miss Teresa Gravaine.
She is here to enrol in the school.
Is the young lady a relation?
No. I'm a... friend of her mother.
I sent a letter ahead to explain.
A friend recommended you.
I hope she likes it.
Would you like to see the house?
This is the painting,
drawing and sculpture room.
Three times each week the students make
reproductions in oil, crayon and acrylic.
Some of the paintings adorning the walls
of the library are the work of our students.
Let's move on.
Teresa.
- This way.
We set great store by the
spiritual enrichment...
and physical well-being
of the girls in our charge.
This is the music and dance classroom.
Group exercises are required,
but afterwards the girls can
play piano, violin, harp or cello.
The bar and mirror are for ballet exercises.
We don't expect many
to perform in the theater,
but we still expect them to do an
hour of practice per day.
Apart from instilling in the
girls a sense of graceful movement -
don't forget most of our girls are
no longer children -
it also provides them with useful exercise and
prevents them from indulging in morbid gossip.
Do you play the piano, Miss?
I played until I was thirteen,
but then gave it up.
But you still remember how to play?
Yes. I think I do.
Is something wrong?
No. Nothing.
Some of our girls are fascinated by botany.
One of them, Margarita Salgren,
is quite an authority on the subject.
In the library we have many of her essays
concerning botanical specimens.
Some are even
published in the academy...
It was nothing; a plant was knocked to
the floor, probably by the wind. This way.
This park is one of the prettiest in
the region. Naturally, we...
This way, please. Careful on the steps.
Naturally, our girls receive cooking lessons.
As you know, the culinary arts form a very
important part of a cultural education.
There is a very cordial
ambiance between the students,
their ages vary between 15 and 21,
and I'm certain that the young lady will quickly
make good new friends amongst them,
and that she'll soon feel
very much at home here.
This is the dining room.
I can also show you the work room,
and the reading room, but later.
Would you like to see the dormitories?
No, that won't be necessary, Madam.
How old are you, Miss?
- Eighteen.
Have you ever been to boarding school?
- No.
Ah - Maria.
Please accompany Miss
Gravaine to the dining room.
It's after five and she might
like a snack.
We'll see you shortly.
Would you like to
accompany me to the library?
I'd be pleased to, Madam.
Please, take a seat.
- Thanks.
The name of her parents?
Her mother's name is Violeta Gravaine.
She is a good friend of mine,
as I already said.
One of our rules here concerns
maintaining absolute discretion...
regarding the families of our students.
So I was told by Mr. Maribeaux.
Pedro Maribeaux, of Avignon,
recommended your establishment.
Teresa's mother cannot meet the needs
of the girl's education herself.
For that reason she would like
her placed in a boarding school.
The girl may stay
until she is of legal age.
The only things we require are the name and
address of the person legally responsible for her,
and the tuition fee of 300 francs
per semester, paid in advance.
Very well.
Her mother is Violeta Gravaine,
Barco Street, number 8, Avignon.
Avignon.
There you are - for two semesters.
Would you like a receipt?
- That won't be necessary.
Our boarding school specializes
in the education...
of girls who are,
how shall we say? Difficult.
There are few amongst them who, despite
their youth, have lead exemplary lives.
In order to get them
back on the right track,
I must run the school with a firm hand.
Miss...
Would you like something, Miss?
No. Nothing, thanks.
- Are you finished?       - Yes.
Why don't you eat the biscuits?
They're very good.
No, but thanks.
Keep them then.
There won't be much for supper.
"Phanius the True made his way to the fastness
where Apollo rules, enthroned on high,
"into the vast cavern, beyond which is
the awful secret, so-secluded place.
"Here the prophetic Delian God breathes into her
the spirit's visionary mind, revealing things to come.
"They were already drawing near to
Diana's temple.
"Daedalus, according to the story,
fleeing from the kingdom of Minos...

its elaboration, the..."
That's enough, Miss.
You are excused, girls.
What's your name?
- Teresa Gravaine.
You've got guts.
- Maybe I do.
I’ve been here a while.
Stick with me.
Shush yourself!
Misses Toupain, Fragonar and Rigeaux...
Would you come with me?
You can talk now.
What's your name?
Where are you from?
Teresa Gravaine. I'm from Avignon.
Isabelle, Clara, Cecilia.
My name is Isabella.
My name is Margarita.
You'll meet us soon enough.
Can we see at your clothes?
Yes, of course.
Your family must have money.
- No.
What do you mean?
Your clothes are beautiful.
Isabelle, what do
you think of his on me?
All of these
things belong to my mother.
Is this your mother's too?
Yes.
I love it.
I'll trade you for it.
It's a gift.
- Thanks.
Tell me, at your house do
they know all about this place?
I 'm sure they do.
If you write to your parents and tell
them you want to leave, will they let you?
Yes, of course.
Then you won't be here long.
Three girls
have recently run away.
Teresa. Miss Destrais
is taking all of your nightgowns.
Not at all. She is rotten,
though not as bad as everyone says.
Tomorrow when you meet Catalina,
if she isn’t spending another night
and day in the discipline chamber,
ask her what
she thinks of this place.
Who is Catalina?
A good girl.
Well... Given any thought to
your behavior this afternoon?
Yes.
Are you ready
to apologize to your classmates?
Miss Lacienne,
I am speaking. Answer me.
Get up.
Get up!
Your lack of respect and rudeness
has brought us to this point.
I will not continue before
properly disciplining you.
Why not kick me out?
Nothing would make me happier...
but your parents insist that you stay.
This isn't the first time I will have
been forced to punish you... is it?
I'll ask you only once more...
Will you accompany me to the dorm
to apologise to your classmates?
Very well...
Take off your clothes.
You will obey! Take off
your clothes, Miss Lacienne.
You’ll have to do it yourself.
Alright... Do it.
Let go! Let go!
Bitches! Little whores!
Let go of me!
Let's go ladies. It is late.
Protect our boarding school.
Guard our purity and keep us chaste.
In your honor we will
practice peace and friendship...
...and protect our residence,
and keep us safe.
Guard our place of slumber
from nocturnal spirits...
...and protect our bodies from
painful punishment.
Grant that we be not harmed by others,
and that under your protection
we will know no pain...
...and we will follow your
wise commandments,
so that we remain safe in your care.
That's enough...
that's enough!
You may go.
- Good night.
I had to do that...
I can't allow anyone to defy my orders...
not even you.
You know that... don't you?
Try to understand my position.
Okay?
Tell me why you've been following
the new girl all day long?
Answer me!
- I haven't been.
You were.
Tell me why you are always
following the girls around?
I know you're
no longer a boy, Luis.
But that doesn’t give you
the right to think about women.
Listen to me: I forbid you to do it again.
Do you hear me?
I will not permit my own son
to bother one of the students.
Their parents might
very well complain about it.
And with good reason. Do you understand?
- Yes, mother.
Then why do you keep doing it?
I've told you
this again and again, Luis.
But mother, whenever I leave my room...
Don't you understand that none
of these girls are any good?
They are brought to me
on account of their problems.
Yes... Those who aren’t thieves
are prostitutes.
Do you believe me, Luis?
They bring them to me
for correction... Impossible.
One day, my son...
one day you'll meet a woman.
You'll marry,
and have your own home.
But none of these
girls are worthy of you.
What you need is a woman like me.
Who will care for you,
love you, and protect you.
We'll find you one, I'm certain.
We'll find you one.
We'll find you one...
- Good morning, girls.
- Good morning, Mlle.
Good morning, Madam.
She’s not married;
the poor thing is still an old spinster.
Today the beds will be made by
Susana Noel and Catalina Lacienne.
We all know that Catalina isn't here.
I said that the beds will be made by
Susana Noel and Catalina Lacienne.
But since Catalina isn't here,
you will be the substitute.
Me?
Yes, you.
Susana will show you what to do.
Whenever you are ready, Miss.
Very well.
Girls, let us go to breakfast.
There's not much to do: make
the beds and open the windows.
And sweep?
No. The dust is the work of
the cleaning lady,
who also helps out in the kitchen.
You'll see that this won't take long.
Do you have a boyfriend?
- No.
And you've never...
You've never been with a boy?
No.
- Really?
Yes, of course.
- Then you're one of the few.
You'll have an easier time of it
being stuck in here.
For me, it's just awful.
To take little breaks
from them doesn't matter.
But to go for months on end
without seeing a boy...
that's the main cause of
nervous breakdowns around here!
Every three weeks a boy comes here.
- Here?
Yes, to the boarding school.
His name is Enrique.
He’s the son of the village butcher.
Not very cute, but...
He brings us firewood, and
sometimes a special thing for me.
Each time he comes, one of us
gets to go and meet him.
The next time will be my turn.
- Your turn?
Yes. I'll be taking a little
'outing' with him.
You'd understand better if you
had known a boy before coming here.
No, I understand.
I've always assumed that the girls who run away
do it to be with their boyfriends or someone else.
The only girl who probably
won’t try this is Isabelle.
Isabelle?
Yes, Isabelle Delors. She sleeps in
that bed. A l5 year-old redhead.
Oh yes, I know her.
The poor girl is in love
with Madam Fourneau's son.
She has a son?
- Yes, he lives on the third floor.
Just a kid, probably 16 or 17 years old.
A stupid and creepy boy.
He's always spying on us through
cracks in the doors and walls.
He even follows
us around the house.
Isabelle, on the other hand,
claims he's a very intelligent boy.
They see each other?
Yes. It's not that difficult to sneak out of a
class without being seen by Mlle. Desprez.
That’s enough for today.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Have you been waiting long?
- I came after lunch.
So you've been waiting for me
for more than two hours?
It doesn't matter.
Did they see you leave?
- No. I don't think so.
Isabelle, I'm worried we'll be found out.
I'm worried for you, naturally.
And I 'm worried for you.
Is that your dessert from today?
Yes. It's for you.
- Thank you.
One day... you'll see.
We'll leave this place.
We'll leave together.
- And your mother?
I've told you many times...
She doesn’t matter.
I can't stay here.
We must leave to be together.
Every moment, I fear that
we'll be discovered, and that...
Who could that be?
You see? You start
by planting the seeds in here.
When the seedlings are
ready you transplant them.
What should I do?
Prepare the soil.
Like this, with your finger.
All at equal distances.
Then you take a handful of seeds...
Look, here they are.
Put them in the holes and then
cover them up with earth,
and then cover it all with this stuff;
it's fertiliser.
Fertiliser?
Yes, whatever is in the soil
ensures that the plants will grow.
What are the seeds?
Azaleas. They say that both the seeds and
flowers are poisonous, so be careful.
Don't worry about the azaleas...
I'm sure that if the seeds were poisonous,
Madam Fourneau wouldn’t be around anymore.
One of us would have put them
in her soup.
Any word on Catalina?
- No.
How long will the plants need?
Months! For months on end, every
day, you have to water them,
weed them, prop them up,
and transplant them.
Then finally
one day you'll have a flower.
Yes, in the end, the flower is
cut, withers and is thrown away.
Such a foolish way to waste
one’s time. It's called gardening.
Gardening is the poetry of nature.
Teresa, Madam Fourneau wants to see you.
- I'm almost finished.        - Let's go.
Where can I wash?
- Do it later. Let's go; she's waiting.
What does she want?
- I don't know.
Madam Fourneau wishes to see me?
- No, I do.
I've made tea.
Would you like a cup?
This morning you
were alone with Susana.
Perhaps Susana told you how
this boarding school functions?
No.        - Did she speak of me?
- No.
Are you certain?
Yes. Of course.
She didn't speak of Enrique,
nor the childishness
that occurred three weeks ago?
Yes. She spoke about that.
Just as I suspected.
- I don't understand.
I’m in charge of many things around here.
Selecting who gets to see Enrique
on the days that he comes,
as well as access to the
other visitors to the school.
Madam Fourneau requires that everyone
here is properly disciplined.
She depends on me for this.
Would you like tea?
Where have you been?
- In the greenhouse.
Get cleaned up.
I would like your time in the
boarding school to be pleasant.
I can make sure that you eat well,
that you don't work too hard...
and that you meet Enrique.
The only thing you must do is obey me...
obey me in everything I tell you.
...Catalina was with her
the night she ran away...
Yes, but she had the habit of...
Don’t go out dressed like that.
What men are going to see me?
You'll catch a cold. Put something on.
One key is for the dormitory,
the other is for the main door.
I'll wait for you at eleven
in the greenhouse. Luis.
Good night, girls.
- Good night, Mlle.
I’m asking for the last time.
Did anyone see
Isabelle go out last night?
It would be best that you
tell me everything you know.
Be advised that if
any of you tries to escape...
I will punish you exactly as
I did the last girl who escaped.
This morning when Mlle. Desprez
arrived, she found this door open.
Isabelle Delors left this way.
She had to open it with a key,
and that should have made a noise.
I was near the door,
but I didn't hear a noise.
That's very strange, Mlle. Desprez,
especially since...
you are the only one
with a key to the dormitory.
The keys you gave me are never
separated from me.
It is impossible that someone could
take them without my knowing it.
Fine. If any of you intend on following
in the steps of Miss Delors,
then I suggest you do it very well and in secret,
and that you don't let me discover you.
If I catch any of you trying to escape...
well, you already know me... right?
We must change the locks on
the dormitory and the main door.
How many keys should I order?
Three: one for me,
one for you, and one for Irene.
You don't think that Irene Toupain
helped Miss Delors escape...?
Irene? No. Mlle. Desprez, Lock all the
windows on the first floor.
...and if a girl wants to run away?
The school is not a prison.
If it's not, let's make it one.
Go to the village and inquire
whether anyone has seen Isabelle.
Very well. Today is Tuesday.
Who will be in charge of bathing?
I'll do it.
Mr. Brechard! Mr. Brechard! The water!
The water is ready, Madam.
- Thank you.
Let’s go girls.
Let’s go. Let's go. Enter.
Finish. Out you come.
Dry yourselves off. Out you come.
Everyone, hurry up. Let's go.
Miss Lacienne! What are you doing?
Taking this off;
I want to wash my shoulders, Madam.
You can understand that.
Do you have a problem with it?
No.
Finish, girls. Out you come.
Miss Gravaine... Miss Gravaine!
Yes?
Come on out. Leave the showers.
Yes, Madam.
Miss! Please!
I'm in the boiler room.
Please, Miss. Help me.
What are you doing, Teresa?
What were you doing in the boiler
room after everyone else left?
I saw you go in there several times.
You saw me go in there?
If you do anything that
is forbidden by Madam Fourneau,
one of us will see.
You weren't aware of that?
There are three of us who will swear we
saw you alone in there with Luis many times.
We want to talk to you about this.
After class ends, we will await
you in the dining room.
And if you don’t show up, remember:
we will talk to Madam Fourneau.
Let's go.
The boy with the firewood is here.
Do you want a hand?
- No, it's okay...
I'll unload the wood myself, then
let you know when I'm finished.
Okay.
- Goodbye.
Embroidery is a good pursuit for a girl.
Especially when one learns
to harmonize the colors.
It's like painting.
Pardon me, Madam Fourneau...
in cooking class we are
preparing apples for a compote,
and we left the pot on the fire.
Could one of us go and check on it?
Of course.
You go ahead yourself.
If you don't mind,
I’d like to finish this stitch.
Could... Susana go instead?
Go ahead, Miss Noel.
Excuse me.
How does it look?
Good. But it's not quite done.
Do you want me to stir?
Would you? What an awful day!
This compote
and everything else!
Would you mind watching it for a moment?
I must run and do an errand.
Alright, but don't take too long.
- Thank you.
You know I'm not allowed to help
you in your cooking classes.
Yes, yes - thank you.
What are you looking at, Miss Chalgarin?
Nothing, Madam, excuse me.
I just needed to stretch.
Hello.
Hello.
Girls.
Girls.
Girls! You're excused.
Luis!
- What, mother?
What were
you doing in the garden?
I went out to take a little air.
Since the girls are in their music class,
I didn't think you'd mind.
Now? The humidity is
too high for you. Come in.
You know very well you must be careful.
But mother...
No, don't start.
You read until very late,
you don't sleep well
and you don't eat enough.
But mother, I always...
How am I to run this boarding school if
I must constantly watch over you?
You know that you’re not a boy like
the rest. You were always sick.
Remember your asthma?
I know that it's difficult for you
to be inside all the time,
but it is absolutely necessary.
It's either that or a trip to the hospital.
I would much prefer that this were a school
where you could meet boys your own age,
but for the moment that is not possible.
I know, mother.
Luis, you know that there is nothing I want
more than a normal life for you,
but you must help me...
I need your help.
Why do you say that mother?
I do everything you require.
Is that a fact?
I know that you see one
of the girls almost every day.
That’s not true.
Someone saw you.
Who?
It doesn't matter who.
One of the girls.
But one day we’ll
leave the boarding school,
and until that day you must take
care of your health and stay indoors
Luis, I've told you hundreds of times:
none of these girls are worthy of you.
What you need is a woman like me,
who will care for you, love you.
Promise me. You won't
see that girl again - ever.
I promise you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Luis. You'll see...
the day will come, I'm certain,
when you'll meet a girl.
And you'll fall in love with her.
A girl like I was, years ago.
Understand?
Serious and understanding...
who lives only for you.
Just as I live. And who
loves you, as I love you.
Come.
Where are we going?
To the kitchen?      - No.
Then where?      - You'll see.
- Where?       - You'll see in a moment.
Why did you lock it?
Who's inside?
Enter.
Enter.
Was she late?
No. After class ended I got her.
Very well, Teresa. I'm
fond of order and punctuality.
Come in.
This afternoon, after sewing class,
I spoke with Madam Fourneau.
I told her that her son often
meets someone in the boiler room.
Don't worry, Teresa
I didn't tell her it was you.
Come in, Teresa, come in.
You should have seen how mad she got!
She said that she would write to
the girl's parents and expel her.
By the way, Teresa, you
don't have any parents, do you?
Teresa, are you going to answer me?
Do you have any or not?
No. They died long ago.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
- Don’t lie.
No. My mother is on her own.
That's what I meant.
No one knows who your father is.
You have your mother’s name, don’t you?
Answer me.
Is it her name or not?
Yes.
In Madam Fourneau's office,
there is no register of students...
but, being in charge of correspondence,
I have learned many things.
An advantage to having a key.
Prepare the tea.
What does your mother do?
Teresa, we want to get to know you.
We want to learn about
your family. You understand?
Yes.
Does your mother work?
Yes.
What does she do?
She sings.
Oh, she sings?
Yes.
- Opera?
No.
- Where does she sing, Teresa?
In Avignon.
Oh? How interesting. Serve the tea.
So she works in Avignon?
Not exactly a big city.
In which miserable theatre
does she give her concerts?
In which theatre, Teresa?
The... the Tivoli.
The Tivoli? Must be
some burlesque cafe, or worse.
What is the Tivoli, Teresa?
What is the Tivoli, Teresa?
A cabaret.
A cabaret? But only
prostitutes go to a place like that.
Your mother?
Teresa, I'm asking you if your mother
is a prostitute?      - No, she isn't, no!
I think she is.
- She isn't. She's just a singer.
She is a prostitute, otherwise why would she
work in that sort of establishment?
No, she isn’t!
- She is!
No, she isn’t!
She is! Clearly she is.
She is. Obviously!
No, she isn’t!
She is!
No!
And this is the sort of thing
she has to wear in that nightclub.
No!
Why not try on this corset?
Put it on.
No.
Put it on.
- No!
Put it on, just like your mother.
I'll force you to.
I'll put it on myself.
No!
Please, please!
We've never been to one of those clubs.
We only want to see what it's like
inside one.
Why not dress up like your mother and
sing us a song from her repertoire?
You pick which one. Your
mother never taught you a song?
She never sang them around the house?
I'm sure she did at least once.
You can at least try.
Let's go. Sing for us!
Sing, Teresa.
Come on Teresa, sing.
Sing... sing!
He's my love, my darling love...
Louder, Teresa.
He’s my love, my darling love...
- Louder, and smiling.
He’s my love, my darling love...
- That's better, that's better. Sing, Teresa.
He’s my love, my darling love...
- Louder. Smile a little more. Louder.
He’s my love, my darling love...
- Smile. Sing. Sing. Sing, Teresa.
He’s my love, my darling love...
- We still can't hear you!
Come on, smile like your mother.
Louder. Sing, Teresa, sing.
He’s my love, my darling love...
I'm sure your mother smiles much more than that.
Now don't cry, smile. Come on, smile.
He’s my love, my darling love...
Smile more. Smile and sing louder. Come on, louder.
- I can't, I can't.
We can't hear you! Louder! Louder and faster!
Smile, Teresa, smile. Smile, smile!
I can't! I can't! I can't!
Time for class.
Very well, Teresa. We'll
continue this tomorrow. Okay?
"...and so, returning to their house, Lucia and her mother gave
away, piece by piece, everything that they owned to the poor.
"Hearing about this, Lucia's betrothed was furious
and complained to the Consul Pascasio,
"saying that Lucia was a Christian,
and was not obeying the Imperial laws.
"Caspasio, having sent for Lucia to appear, reproached her
for having wasted away her dowry..."
What's wrong?
- Nothing.
"...and demanded that she should offer
scarifices to the Gods."
What's the matter with you?
I'm leaving, Luis.
I can't stay here any longer.
I've come to say goodbye.
Come in.
You're leaving? Where to?
Home. I can't take it here any longer.
Why not?
- It doesn't matter.
Did my mother say something to you?
No. But she knows we see each other.
She knows I see a girl, but not which one.
Not yet, but she'll soon figure it out.
Besides, I'm not going
only because of that.
Why then?
Because this afternoon...
Forget it.
You can't go now, Teresa.
You're my only friend.
I'll miss you.
Me too.
It's not much, but you'll need it.
Thank you. I promise to pay you back.
It can't be easy to escape
from the boarding school.
No. Since the girls escaped, my mother
has locked all the doors.
I know. But I think I could get into the garden
through one of the dining room windows,
and then perhaps I could climb the wall...
You can't do it. It's too high, and the
gardener has covered the walls with plants.
Try to climb over the iron gate.
I'll see. Goodbye, Luis...
and thank you.
What are you doing here?
To get over that wall
without a ladder is impossible.
Perhaps there were some loose bricks, or some
cracks in the wall that she might have used?
No, Madam. The only way out is
over the iron gate.
She didn't go through that door.
Fine. Thank you.
Brechard. Make sure all the windows
in the dining room are locked.
Yes, Madam.
Teresa never left the boarding school.
That's absurd.
Last night I planted
myself in front of the main doors.
I watched them constantly, and
Teresa never went through them.
She could have
escaped before you got there.
I don't think so. This is all
very strange, Madam Fourneau.
What do you find so strange?
I'm thinking of the broken window...
and the light I saw in the dining room...
and the wet patch on the floor.
Five girls have escaped in the last
three months. Teresa was the fifth.
Girls are always running away from
reformatories or boarding schools.
Yes, but we usually
hear about them soon enough.
Their families inform us
about them, or bring them back.
But I'm in charge of correspondence here, and we've
never heard from any of these girls again.
Perhaps they return home, and their
families don't bother writing.
Then why didn't you write to them to let
them know their daughters escaped?
Are you telling me what to do?
I'm saying that there are
strange things going on here.
We both know that.
You taught me some of them.
But there are other things that
I cannot and must not tolerate.
What are you talking about?
I don't know, Madam,
I really don't know.
One... two... three... four...
The only thing I do
know is that I'm leaving.
You will remain here, Miss Toupain... eight...
You cannot make me.
We'll see.
I don't think it would be a good idea
for you to force me to stay, Madam Fourneau.
Remember that I know many things about you,
and about your teaching methods.
There is nothing going on here that's different from
what goes on in any other school.
Are you certain, Madam Fourneau?
Your keys.
"Virgil possessed an exquisite sensibility...
Virgil possessed an exquisite sensibility...
"for the description of his characters...
for the description of his characters...
"who are fundamentally human."
Miss Lacienne!
- What?     - If...
Nothing. Let's continue.
"Profoundly... Romans...
"The Romans considered...
The Romans considered that...
"the Aeneid. The Aeneid.
The Romans considered that..."
The dough is like a barnyard animal.
To make it do what you want,
you must handle it roughly.
I remember that my
mother always used to say,
"The harder you use your hands,
the softer the pastry will be."
Let's see. That one is very good
Yours is fine. You're finished.
Let's see this one.
You need a little more.
The flour must be added bit by bit.
This may seem like a waste
of time, but that's not the case.
And don’t forget the salt.
Remember that even the sweetest
pastries need a pinch of salt.
The dough should be nice and spongy.
Unfortunately, cooking is not
like the things that you learn upstairs.
There are no fixed and simple rules.
I’ve taken care of everything.
What did you do with the packets?
I have them.
- And the window in the kitchen?
It’s easy to open.
- Scared?       - A little.
Do you remember if there is a key
to this door?       - No, I don't think so.
And the kitchen door?
- No, not that one either.
Let’s see.
That’s very good. Very good.
Let's see.
You could do better. Try again.
Not bad.
In the name of the father,
the son and the holy ghost.
Lord, bless this food we are
about to eat. Amen.
Amen.
...and that our hearts
always remain pure,
so that at any moment we
might be received by heaven.
Good night, girls.
- Good night.
Come in.
They have gone to bed, Madam.
Do you require anything else of me?
No. Did you lock all the doors?
Yes, Madam.
- Then go to bed.
Julia?
- Madam?
I would like to
talk to Miss Toupain.
Is she asleep already?
I don’t know.
She just went to bed.
Please, tell her
to come talk to me, and...
that's all.
Very well, Madam. Good night.
- Good night.
Miss Toupain?
What's going on?
Go down to the office.
Madam Fourneau wants to talk to you.
Why don't you just put on your robe?
I’ll be cold.
You have your keys, right?
- Yes... yes, of course.
See you tomorrow then.
- Good night.
Miss Toupain?
Please open up.
Irene?
Irene!
Irene... What happened to you?
Oh my God...
Mama. I'm glad you came. Enter.
I was just about to look for you.
Come closer, mama. Look: there she is.
She was only missing hands.
Irene had hands just like yours...
Slim, but strong.
I took the dress some time ago,
when I decided to make a girl... just like you...
A girl for me.
Now she's got everything.
The hair is just like yours - soft.
The same eyes -
Isabelle had eyes just like yours.
You always said I would find a
girl like you, when you were young.
And now I have her.
See her?
All she needs is to learn how
to take care of me, the way you do.
And to love me, the
way you have always loved me.
Luis! Luis, Luis! Luis!
Talk to her, mother...
Talk to her.
Talk to her, mother...
Talk to her.
Luis! Luis! Luis!
