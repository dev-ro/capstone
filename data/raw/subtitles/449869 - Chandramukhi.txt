Nair, good news.
Your town tender has come to us
Rs 200 crore contract on a
mere 3 lakhs bid difference
Our Ganesh construction has got it
A Rs 200 crore road contract
and we missed out for a mere 3 lakhs...
to Ganesh constructions
We need that contract,
no matter what it takes
Boss, from this moment you may
think the contract is ours
He should not be allowed
to enter this town
Bash him and get me that contract
Where is your boss?
Who are you all? What do you want?
I am engineer Kumar speaking.
Someone has intercepted our
staff vehicle and are threatening us
Who are they? What do they want?
I don't know who they are
and what they want
Come soon sir!
Where are you now?
- 15 Kms from our place
I'll be right there
Catch them! Don't spare them
Saravanan, you!
Are you alright?
I'm fine
When did you come from U. S?
How did you come here?
I was coming from the airport,
I saw thugs chasing women
How could I ignore that?
So gave them few thrashings
How come you are so trim?
If I am obese it may not look nice.
If you are thin it won't look nice
My company staff. I got a call
saying they had a problem
But you rescued them before I did
- Had he not come in time...?
Now that he's back
it's gonna be great!
Where is your beautiful wife
Ganga Senthilnathan?
She is here
Ganga...? Where is she?
She was right here
Scared me
Last year you introduced her to me
as your love
Wasn't she a reserved type?
So mischievous now?
It's her mischief
that I like
Come, let's go home
- Go on, I'll come in my car
Mother is not happy with our marriage
nor with our Vettayapuram trip
You must reason with her
I'll go and see father
Sir, I am a psychiatrist
only because of you
You brought up this orphan as
your own son. I can never forget that
Though you are not with us
you will always live in our hearts
Mom, greetings
Come Saravanan...
so you find time to visit us?
After your last year visit
you didn't even make a call!
I don't care if you are
a great doctor
Don't worry, I am not going to
leave India for quite sometime
I will make you all happy
and I will also remain happy
You will make all those here happy.
But who will solve my problem?
I will do it, don't worry
How did you say, what I had in mind?
That is his speciality
Looking at your face he would say
what is in your mind.
He is not a mere doctor,
he is also an expert mind reader
How else can he treat
confused psychiatric patients?
Shut up
Not a big deal. There is nothing
that cannot be achieved by practice
What makes you think that the people
there will cause problems for Senthil
in his construction work?
- What do you know?
I wanted to reunite his father's family
by getting him married to his cousin
But if they find out that he had
a love marriage like his father...
they might do anything to this girl
You think it's funny?
None of you know about Akilandeshwari
Even her brothers are frightened of her
She is such a terror
She would surely harm
Ganga and take her revenge
I am not going to stay in their house
Then where?
I have bought the Vettayapuram palace
I am going to stay there
What, mother?
- As a kid...
I heard lots about that palace
That is a dangerous place.
For nearly 50 years
no one came forward to buy that
Are you mad to buy that palace?
Don't worry about Senthil or Ganga.
I will ensure nothing happens to them
I shall leave for Vettayapuram today.
My first task would be...
to meet your relatives and console them.
I'll also check the palace thoroughly
Later I will decide whether these two
should stay there or not
'Akhilandeswari House'
Dear, dear!
Have you ever called me lovingly?
You always alarm me! What is so urgent?
- Look! People and cars!
They are coming here
Come on in, sir.
He is a big textile businessman
They have come to seek
your eldest daughter Priya
My sister Akilandeswari takes
all decisions in this house
Though Priya is our daughter
she was brought up by my sister
I'll come after consulting my sister
Kasturi married my fiance, but now she
has forgotten the 30 year animosity...
and seeks my daughter for her son
So I have decided that he will be
my son-in-law
Okay sister.
Where is that businessman?
- They heard what sister said
All the cars have taken an about turn.
- Is it?
It is 8 years since we are married.
In all those I have not seen...
anybody from your uncle's family
- These families parted ways 30 years ago
This wedding will reunite them.
You'll see all of them
Come soon, come
Oh Lordl
Lord of the seven hillsl
Look at us
Our folk, s hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it
When all the powers are harnessed...
this earth would turn a heaven
Oh Lordl Lord of the seven hillsl
Look at us
Think for a while
The tiller would smear legs in mud...
so that we can lay hands on our food
If those who clean the drain...
go on leave for four days,
the town would stink
If we don, t have hairdressers...
will we look handsome?
If there is no one to wash
clothes in river water...
will the dirty linen get brighter?
Which ever job you do,
work is worship
Pattukottai said so in his song
When all the powers are harnessed...
this earth would turn a heaven
Oh Lordl
Lord of the seven hillsl
Look at us
Let people say
anything about you...
just listen through one ear
and push it out through the other
Even if the cloud floats
or the crow flies...
the sky won, t get dirtier
Even if a ball is immersed in water
it would float...
Even if you are sidelined
come on up brother, like a ball
Can the crescent
changing to a full moon...
be prevented by glow worms?
When all the powers are harnessed...
this earth would turn a heaven
Oh Lordl Lord of the seven hillsl
Look at us
Our folk, s hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it
Our folks hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it
Superb
When all the powers are harnessed...
this earth would turn a heaven
We don't know when and
how son-in-law is coming
Who let that bullock cart in?
Who is that?
Stop, stop! I say, stop!
You don't pay heed to
a respectable man!
Don't I look like a man?
- No, no
Who are you?
Why did you bring in a bullock cart?
We are expecting our son-in-law
From Chennai. Kasturi madam's...
- Son-in-law!
We expected you by flight. And here you
come in a bullock cart, like a simpleton
Look, I'm not your son-in-law
Right. Not before the wedding
Are you joking?
I'm not your son-in-law. Well...
- Well, you are here now
Oh, how do I explain?
I'm Senthilnathan's friend Saravanan
Before I could explain over the phone
the line got disconnected
Your mother called us and told us
to expect such excuses from you...
because you would be embarrassed
to stay in our home
My sister has taken Priya to the temple
Son-in-law, stop lying now
Oh! You useless fellow
What are you looking at?
Burn the crackers!
Where is son-in-law?
My wife is also missing!
Excuse me! I am scared of crackers.
- Me too
Where is she?
I feel you are like my sister.
- I also feel...
you are like my brother
What bloody feeling?
She is not the girl
you are going to marry
I have already married her
and she lives with me
It is true we have been married
for 8 years and have no children
So don't shift your feelings
towards him, Swarna
What? You and Swarna don't
have children even after 8 years?
He read my mind!
Good Lord!
Simply gorgeous
Enough. I am telling you once again,
she is my wife
Son-in-law, if you talk to your uncle
he would talk for the whole day
Come here
I burst crackers for him,
but he drops a bomb on me
He is praising her too much.
- I will praise her!
Son-in-law, the bullock cart journey
must've been tiring
Go take a shower and rest
What, what is this?
- Brother, let us not have him here
For what?
- We don't need him here
If you allow him to enter, we may
lose many valuables. Be careful
Don't blabber.
- Am I blabbering?
He is calling me over...
did he hear what I just said?
You don't like me
staying here, isn't it?
On my way here, I asked many people
about Vettayapuram palace
Everyone was scared and
no one was prepared to help me
So?
- Lf you take me to the palace...
I won't stay here, otherwise...
- Otherwise?
I will stay here.
- Oh no! I will take you there
But you should do what you say.
- I will say only what I do
Both are same. Shall we go?
Go inside, go!
Even the gate gives me the creeps
This is the Vettayapuram palace.
Now that you have seen it, let's go
Take off your hands.
- Why? Do you want to ride in?
Come inside.
- Where?
Come on!
- Buddy, I'm not going inside
I won't go inside, I swore to you!
It's not fair to force an elderly person
Had I told you, you wouldn't have come.
That is why I'm forcing you
So informal?
- Right
No good showing respect
to a cowardly old man
I won't go, even if you abuse me!
- Who stays here?
I won't tell.
- Swarna!
A gardener and his grand daughter!
- Really? So why are you so scared?
They don't stay inside palace.
- But we're going in
You may go in! I'll go back home.
- Why is that rope and log hanging there?
Painting work is in process.
- Then, are there painters inside?
Only one guy named Gopal.
He has been painting for a month
A guy staying here alone for a month,
but we both are scared to go in?
But he is from another village.
Had he known he would've fled
It is so dark in here
even in broad daylight
Murugesh, do you know the
history behind this palace?
Does STD mean history?
Inmates of this palace fled 50 years ago
Now some fool has bought it
and is having it painted
They can't hide what is inside
by painting the outside
Let us go now.
- OK, let us go
Not inside but outside.
Look, an elephant is lying dead here
That is a buffalo, Murugesh.
- Buffalo?
What do you think there is inside?
- Ghosts, they say
Fools.
- Evil spirits, they say
Cowards.
- A 30-feet snake, since 30 years!
That is why, that Gopal...
- A snake, really...?
He doesn, t work here beyond 4 p. M
One day he boldly worked after 4 p. M...
And that day, things strangely
started breaking suddenly
Ever since, he leaves the palace
by 4 to 4:30 p. M
Why should a guy with
so much fear work alone?
Groom is missing?
Groom!
He ditched me! Oh God!
He left me alone.
How will I go out?
I've to go 1 k.m. From here.
Gopal, take me along. Where are you?
He came with me,
and ditched me, murderer
A lion!
Brother Murugesh, look at me
Say something... please
Didn't I ask you not to take him there?
Just look at him
He looks like one of those big shots,
frozen with a smile while being arrested
What to do now?
Sister...? Why is there a crowd here?
What happened?
Greetings, I am...
- not the groom
Where is my prospective son-in-law?
When they said, you came by bullock cart...
I knew that you were not my son in law
Because his son wouldn't come like that.
- You said it right
I tried to tell them
I am not the groom...
but they don't believe me
But you've understood it on your own
The groom has decided to buy
'Vettayapuram Palace' in this village
He has sent me for that. I am his friend.
I've been brought up in his house
My name is Saravanan.
- Impossible!
I won't allow him to buy
the 'Vettayapuram Palace'
lt'll be dangerous for him to buy that
For my daughter too,
who will marry him
Well, lady...
I don't know how to say this.
His marrying your daughter...
There he comes
He resembles his dad
You? Son in law?
Priya, come here.
You wanted to see your fiance
He has arrived. Come and see him
Who's that?
She is Ganga
My wife
His mother wanted him
to marry your adopted daughter...
but due to certain circumstances,
Senthil had to marry Ganga
What is this? People from big families
asked for my daughter's hand...
but I didn't agree,
but you have deserted us
Marriages and alliances are decided
by destiny. How can we control it?
What a knowledge at such an young age?
You have Avvaiyar's brain. Shake hand
Let it be
My marriage definitely would have
hurt you
But I've come here only to see you all.
Pardon me
We shall leave now.
- Where?
I've bought 'Vettayapuram Palace'.
We shall be staying there
You mean THAT palace? Please don't
Why?
- I went to see it, and I got a shock
If you buy it,
you'd be inviting trouble
Uncle, you are all elderly,
this is what you believe
Listen to me. Just like my uncle,
you also married an outside girl
However, I won't allow you to stay
in such a dangerous place
Uncle, before coming here
Ganga and I visited that palace
Nothing is scary over there like he said
Don't mistake me, I've been a gardener
in that palace for 40 years
Even I've not gone inside that palace.
Please think and act
I've bought that 50-crore worth
property for 5 crore rupees...
I know that people believe that
it has some problems
But I don't believe it. I want my wife
Ganga to be the owner...
of a palace instead of just a house.
That's why I bought it
In case of any problems, we'll deal
with it. You don't worry
Go stay there
You may go and stay in that house
Why do you stare? I stood against buying
that house. Are you wondering...
why I am asking him to stay there?
Not only them, but all of us
are going to stay there...
until his contract gets over.
- Oh God!
If both of them go there alone and
something happens to them...
his mom will mistake me thinking that
since he didn't marry my daughter...
we had sent him there
despite knowing everything
Hence all of us will go and stay there
until everything is solved
Correct.
- Nice of you. Let's get her blessings
No, Senthil
- Why?
Not now
Complete the contract,
then we all can get her blessings
All these poojas won't be
effective in this palace
I've come along only to see your end
Now that you have come,
just watch what happens
Senthilnathan, we are not staying
just because sister asked us to
I don't want you two to stay alone and
get into trouble, that's why I agreed
We would stay here till the end
only on one condition
Tell me, what is it?
- On no account...
should anyone go to the stairway behind
Specifically no one should go to
the room in the southern corner
You have decided to stay with us with
your family. Won't I do atleast this?
We shall stay away from
that place for sure
Now I am happy
Oh God! What would I do?
Why do they buy trouble
and decorate it nicely?
I shouldn't stay alone in the house.
I should always be with the others
Murugesa!
Such a beautiful name. Why do you
call it in such a scary manner?
Why do you create trouble?
- I have a sore throat
I forgot to ask, what is
your zodiac sign?
Why?
Just tell me
Leo.
- Leo, really?
Only one in a lakh will
have this zodiac sign
You are lucky
Ghosts love that sign!
Does it take so many people
to lift one cot?
This is not any ordinary cot?
It is an antique
Made of Burma teak. It takes
more than 2 people to lift it
Bring your wife and come quickly
We are going to visit the family deity.
It's your dad's temple
In a bullock cart with the groom
Why all of you are
coming in a bullock cart?
Sir is a doctor in the U. S, he likes
to go only in a bullock cart
Mercedes Benz is fine, but
the bullock cart has its own charm
Well said
- Gardener, what are you doing here?
My grand daughter is flying kites
with all the kids
So I am here with her
- Who is she?
That girl in a white sari
with black stripes
I did kite flying at a very young age
- Yes
Are you ready?
- Readyl
Crane, fly fly
Hen fly fly
Myna fly fly
Peacock fly
My Kite, fly away
Fly across the sky
Oh my soull Fly
No bounds fly
This kite leaps and flies,
it will fly splendidly
This is super star, s kitel
Our kite
If you see Goddess Meenakshi...
Pray to do away with money lending
at exhorbitant interest
If you see Sri Renganathan...
Ask Talaicauveri to come often
Don, t know about Yesterday or
tomorrow. But today is present
Fly and dance as you wish
The wind is now favourable to us
Our kite is not a butterfly
but an Eagle
The sharpened kite flying thread...
will duel with anyone
This kite leaps and flies,
it will fly splendidly
This is super star, s kite, our kite
If the ladder is kicked
gratitude becomes meaningless
Nod your head to the wind...
thank the kite flying thread gently
Have not gone to schools,
have not gone to college...
but got degrees
Not even books
teach lot of lessons...
kites teach and kite is a teacher
Who can fence the air?
Let us fly like kites
Crane fly fly
Hen fly fly
Myna fly fly
Peacock fly
Oh My kite fly
Fly sky high
Fly across sky no bounds
Fly fly
This kite leaps and flies,
it will fly splendidly
This is super star, s kite, our kite
Priest, this is my nephew Senthilnathan
He has bought the Vettayapuram palace
Everyone is scared when a mention
is made about the palace
What is there? What happened?
About 100 to 150 years ago...
King Vettayan lived in that palace
He used to make a peculiar noise
when he arrives
He would do anything to attain his goal.
He was such a brutal man
Once when he had gone to
Vijayanagaram in Andhra...
he met a dancer called Chandramukhi
He was lured by her beauty and
wanted to make her his mistress
But Chandramukhi did not agree
Because she already loved
a dancer called Gunasekaran
Even after knowing that, the king
abducted her against her wishes
Chandramukhi without the knowledge
of the king...
made Gunasekaran stay in
a nearby house and met him stealthily
The King came to know about this.
On a Durgastami day...
the king killed Gunasekaran
right in front of her...
in the banquet hall of the palace,
and he burnt her alive
Chandramukhi had an untimely death
not doing anything wrong
Her soul wanted to avenge the king
The king knew about this and brought
all sorcerors from all over the country...
and conducted prayers and sealed
Chandramukhi's ashes in a pot
He kept the pot in a room at the southern
corner of the palace and locked it
After some years the king also died.
But Chandramukhi's soul...
is still waiting in that room
to avenge the king
It is said that there is a
king cobra there too
Nobody knows how much of this
is true and how much is not
12 o'clock? This is the time
at which the ghosts come out
They have all left me alone.
Is it a bedroom?
It looks like a big ground.
I accepted not knowing this
Now my heart throbs while I sleep here
Who is that?
Oh God
I didn't do it, I didn't do it
It is me, Murugesan
Why did you come at this time?
- Could not bear my wife's snores
At nights she walks like a devil,
she lies down like a ghost
From the day I heard the
priest's story I have lost my sleep
Let us hug together and sleep here
No.
- Expected. Are you not a doctor?
Please clarify my doubts.
- What Murughesan?
Do ghosts exist?
Have they ever seen one?
Should I believe it or not?
I want to know this
Why do you turn so often?
It seems the priest is better than you
Do ghosts exist? Is there any
indication of a ghost coming?
There are typical indications.
- Like?
A dog howls at a distance
Really, I can hear the sound there
Did I ask?
- No
The breeze blows wild,
the trees sway...
the windows rattle...
I can hear this sound there
Did I ask?
- No
A faint smell of jasmine...
Jasmine!
- Why are you shouting?
Ok, the wind will carry jasmine smell
Yes I can smell the jamine fragrance
Did I ask?
- No
Just hear the story, no cross questions
If you do... what is this?
- Adam's apple
I will pluck it out
Then...
What?
What?
- Anklet
Oh God I hear the anklet sound also
Did I ask?
- No
Then a smoke like image in
white attire comes up
It's showing up!
Where?
- There
Why do you laugh like a woman?
- Not I. The ghost is laughing
Where?
- There
It's gone
You have mistaken my grandpa's dhoti
swinging in the wind for a ghost
Have you not learnt anything?
- Me scared?
Me?
- Yes
Murugesan and I were rehearsing
for a drama. What is you name?
Why?
- Just to know
Durga.
- Goodness me
What?
What an arrogant girl.
I will take care of her later
It's all because of him
He damaged my image
before a beautiful girl
Having done all this
see how he is sleeping
Stop it!
What is this?
Early morning can't you find...
any other place to teach music?
It has become a big nuisance with you
At nights you walk with anklets,
laugh frighten us, and ruin our sleep
Early morning you sing and wake up
all the those who are sleeping
This is not right. I came here
to rest, I have lost my peace
Kids, why do you scream like this?
Go, watch good movies in TV
Look here, Darga...
- Durga!
If you want to teach music,
go to a temple...
or a hall or river side
don't do it here
My friend has bought
this palace shelling out crores
Is this palace meant for you
to teach music?
No, change your location tomorrow.
If I hear the sound again...
I will drive you and
your grandfather away
Look, what ever you do, the
music classes will be held right here
From tomorrow it would be more noisy
If you have decided to go
from this house what can I do?
If I am to forgo my music
I don't want to live in this place
She's an orphan. A bit short tempered
but doesn't take anything to heart
Until you leave this place I will ask
her not to conduct classes here
I beg of you
Don't
You may be a modern girl and
would like to see what's up there
But in such matters
you should listen to elders
Come downstairs
Who is that?
You?
What are you doing here
at this time?
I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd
come here for some fresh air
Love?
Are you in love?
- How do you know?
It is evident from your face
The day your dad asked you
to come and see your groom...
you were unperturbed and calm.
I knew then itself you were in love
Tell me, who he is?
Viswanath. Dance professor.
He lives there
I see. Good selection.
- Do you know him?
I know him, I also know who
made him stay in that house
Have you expressed your love?
- Yes
What did he say?
- He asked my dad to come
Didn't you tell him about it?
- I am scared
Then how will your love succeed?
What's your dad's name?
Kandaswamy
Your daughter is in love here,
and you are sleeping?
Hey Mustache!
Oh God
Why are you here at this hour?
- Nothing, just came for some fresh air...
Fresh air? Get lost
What are you doing here at this time?
- Alliance
Alliance?
- Ok, research
Research?
- Love
First this doctor should be
driven out of the house, isn't it?
I told you this that day itself.
You are late
He is interested on that girl.
My wife is saved
A bachelor has one worry, whereas
a married man has thousand worries
Look here
1001st worry
He's just so accurate...!
Grandpa, it's 9 o'clock and yet
no one has come
They won't come.
- Why not?
Bommi is here.
Where are the others?
The uncle who scolded you yesterday,
gave us money...
and asked us not to come for classes.
He asked us to go and watch a movie
Until he goes back it would be better
not to conduct music classes
Durga
Because you don't like me
teaching music...
you stopped them from
attending the classes?
You can only give them money
and send them for movies
But can you buy music
with your money?
I have already bought it
My harmonium?
- I bought all these instruments
Except this box. Your grandpa
gave me this trivia, free of cost
Music is like Saraswathy
It's in the blood by birth
Arrogant people like you will not
understand its importance ever
You will never...
understand! You...
- Look here Darga
Don't curse me, it might come true.
Not for the sake of this box!
You may take it.
- This one?
I won't touch the harmonium
used by you
The Civet hill does not dance.
Bommi dances...
This is a lullaby by God.
Hear it, Bommi
My music enthralls, Bommi
lt, s His song that pervades
I have sung the song
bestowed by Lord Shiva
Through the song
I captivated millions
Circular buds bloomed...
when the breeze caressed
Buds...
gently attunes melody
Music must make one dance...
and swing
Music must make one hear
and captivate
Hearing this music the earth
would always orbit
Tying little cradles a mother, s
lullaby is also music
Man and woman on cot
attuning melody of desires...
is also music
Oh mind, get appeased
Who is the mastermind here?
Check what you know
Gather what is not there
There, s no one who knows everything,
who comprehends everything
The Civet hill does not dance
Dancing Bommi, this is
a lullaby by God
Hearing my song mind
would jump in joy
Is there a place
where His song is not heard?
I have sung the song
bestowed by Lord Shiva
Through the song
I captivated millions
Fantastic! You were wonderful
You have made us dance.
- He does everything nicely
What do you think of my friend?
At a time... he can answer 10 different
questions posed by 10 different people
He's not an ordinary man.
He's extraordinary
What are you watching?
Go inside
Why do you look there?
- Super dress
A wiseman does not require advice
A capable man does not
require advertisement
Through your song
you have taught me a lot
Forgive me
A message for doctor Saravanan
You've got an e-mail
What happened?
- One of your patients is serious
Wants you to return.
- Is it a bad news?
Is it not? You said you will
stay here for a month
But within 6 days you
have been called back
Senthil, a doctor can wait
for the patient...
but a patient should not
wait for the doctor. I'm leaving
What Saravanan?
Saravanan will appear
Sir, I am leaving.
- Really? Take this
Now I am happy. Happy that
you're leaving so soon
Go ahead.
- Correct
You are happy that I'm leaving so soon
But I have finished
a 6 month's job...
In...?
- In just 6 days
The other day we talked about love.
Have you informed your dad?
Love?
Doctor, you left your specs in my room.
- In your room?
I'll take that later.
Let me talk about Priya's love
How dare you talk about
my daughter's affair to me?
Who else should I talk to then?
Do you want me to say it all...
to all the magazines and press?
How can you fall in love with
a complete stranger? How dare you!
Don't get excited. I said she was
in love. Did I say with me?
Priya is in love with
dance professor Viswanath
Yes. Viswanathan is a good boy,
a right match for your daughter
The other day I was talking
only about this to Priya
Next day I talked to Viswanathan.
With your consent...
he is prepared to marry Priya,
he said. So think about it
Don't lose a good alliance
on false prestige
However hard you try you may not
get such a good boy
Once the marriage is fixed
send me an invitation
If required, your second daughter...
- I'll surely invite you. Please leave
Really?
- Really
I forget someone... yes, Swarna
I won't allow you to talk to my wife
even at the risk of my life
Look at his dress.
He is wearing the shirt inside out
lt'd be better to tear it to pieces.
- Is it your dad's property?
It's my money, it's my dough
I may tear it, may not tear it.
What will you do?
This maid has such a sexy hip.
Bad timing! Not when he is around
What will I do? Tonight, somehow,
I am going to get her
This is too much
- What?
Too much. Swarna...
The chicken...
- He asked for chicken, I didn't buy
So he wants to complain about me.
- You see...
Sir, Rajathi Raja, Arunachala
Padyappa, Thalapathi, Manna...
you may leave! Don't break
a happy family
You may leave
What did he say?
- Nothing. He wants us to eat chicken
What?
- A small story
Tell me and leave
This guy cannot even stand up...
but he likes to have 9 wives
Wait
Ganga, I forgot to tell you
I was leaving
You said one month, but you are
leaving in 6 days. Liar
You think disease comes with a notice?
What is this?
For you, to eat on your way.
- All this?
Yes, eat nicely
Do you know what is
the best medicine in world is?
What?
- Food
If you eat to a limit it is medicine.
If you over eat it is poison
Wherever I am, I keep people
around me happy
I did the same thing here also
but I was little excessive to you
If you feel so, forget it
But don't forget me
Bye. May I...?
Sorry... bye
Durga come here,
want to talk to you in private
What Madam? - No formalities.
Call me Ganga
Ok Ganga, tell me what is it?
I have a lot of old books with me.
I want to keep them in...
some room upstairs in the building.
Will you accompany me?
My God! Even my grandpa
doesn't go there
He has also asked me not to go there.
Because Chandramukhi's room is there
Old people have that fear.
Why should we fear? Am I not with you?
Let's go
Ok, you need not come, I am going
What about the people at home?
All have gone to meet Viswanathan
regarding the alliance with Priya
In that case I will come
I didn't love your daughter
for her beauty or status
I lost my parents at a young age
But I wanted to live in a joint family,
so I accepted your daughter's love
That is quite understandable.
I also like the groom... you too like...
We have only seen the groom
Shouldn't we finalise the auspicious
dates for the ceremonies?
Sister, today is a good day,
we can finalise them today itself
My daughter's engagement should
not be held in a tiled house
It should be done in the fort
and in a grand manner
I am glad that you have agreed
Coming 16th is an auspicious day.
Let's do it your way
I think this is the room
Why are there so many amulets?
150 years ago, prayers were
conducted here
Chandramukhi's spirit
is locked up here
Do you believe these stories?
Whatelse?
I think this room has valuable
jewels and diamonds
To prevent theft, these stories
must have been floated
If I get the keys to this room
I would open and show it to you
This room has no key,
it has been lost
But my grandpa told me once... that the
key's mould is available with a blacksmith
We will ask the blacksmith
to make the key immediately
You own the house.
You tell him
If you want, I will bring the key
after it is made
I will order right away
What?
- Here, the key to Chandramukhi's room
What?
- Please don't open this door
What happened?
- The guy who made the key...
has died vomiting blood
If this is the end for the guy
who made the key...
what would happen to me,
who brought this key?
I'm scared.
- Yesterday when I placed the order...
he was drunk. A guy who drinks 24 hours,
would die whether he makes a key or not
It's good he died
after making the key
Don't confuse yourself, be brave
You say the old man died because
he made a key for the southern room
But Ganga who went into the room
is perfectly alright
You are right.
Trust me. The old man
died of a rotten liver
I may sound funny... don't know, what
more is going to happen in this house?
Hoil? It's a marwari festival, right?
Please call the ghost gently or else
it might harm us before it leaves
Hey! Wait... come with me.
Patience! Why is he jumping?
Go calmly
Okay... okay...
If we go inside with him, do you think
we will be able to come back?
Already I'm shivering,
whatever it is don't leave me alone.
A 'Pure Dhanyasi' tune, for my sake
Who is that?
It's me. Chandramukhi
Help!
This thin fellow has provoked
all that was lying silently
Dear! Someone is knocking the door
Why have all of you come at this hour?
- The maid saw something
She's scared. Come soon
Don't be afraid. We are all here.
- What's the commotion? What happened?
She has seen a ghost like figure
wearing anklet running. She's scared
Ghost! Nonsense
Dear!
What?
- Look
How did this break?
- On its own
On its own?
Who appointed you all in this house?
- Durga spoke to the madam...
and got us this job
Ghosts and devils are ficticious.
There are no such things
Don't believe any of it
Where are you coming from at this time?
- I heard some voices, so...
Ok, all of you go from here
I am Senthil speaking.
Has Mr. Saravanan come?
I am calling for the 7th time.
Are you not able to locate him?
When there was no problem he was here.
Now there are lots of problems here
We need him urgently. Wherever he is,
give him message and ask him to come
Ganga, what happened?
My sari caught fire on its own.
- How will it catch fire on its own?
I don't know,
it caught fire suddenly
She was the only one with me.
- She?
I have no idea.
- Ok, ok
Save me!
Who?
Who is that?
It's you Saravanan!
Is this the one you were talking about?
Seems to be very violent
Why did you let him out?
Can't you lock him in?
Do you want to lock me up?
Who the hell are you?
Have you forgotten uncle?
My friend Saravanan
Doctor? I don't know any one.
I am afraid of every one in this house
Don't know what they will do and when!
Last time he was in modern clothes
Now he comes back in a head gear!
What?
- Nothing. A small... treatment
What is with the attire? Where were you?
How many times have I called you?
When you called, I was at Sabarimalai.
When I reached Pambai, I came to know
And I flew down
Is he the problem?
I know he is always a tense guy
The problem is not with him
Has he come again?
Staying for 6 days he troubled me a lot.
Don't know for how long he'll be here
Don't worry, I won't stay for long.
But I'll leave after fixing all of you
Right?
- Right
How are you? - No!
She is fine. If something goes wrong...
- I will take care, Murugesa
You will take care?
Go inside!
You change your get up, but you won't
change your character
Suspicious person
The problem is not with
anyone in this house
It's the gardener's
grand daughter Durga
The gardener's grand daughter Durga?
Where is your wife Ganga?
Where did she go?
Priya! Priya
What, brother?
- Where are you dear?
What happened to Priya?
Priya, where are you?
- Try there
Don't!
The sound comes from that room.
- That room?
If you close the door in this room
she would die of suffocation
Senthil, come
What happened to you, Priya?
I went upstairs...
I felt someone was following me
When I started running,
it chased me
In my fear I ran into the
last room and hid myself
Someone locked it from outside.
I don't know who did it
Why did you go upstairs?
- I went searching for Ganga
Who told you she was upstairs?
- Durga
Durga? She saw me going
for my bath
Why did she say so?
Saravanan, this is what
is happening here
Whoever is doing this,
what do they want?
Why are they doing this?
I don't understand. Do you?
When you and Ganga
decided to buy this palace...
I was reminded of a book
written by someone long ago
I read that book and gathered
a lot of information
Only after ensuring there was nothing
in the palace as others feared...
I didn't prevent or stand
against your decision
Last time, I just made you all believe
that I was also afraid of ghosts
After everyone was asleep
I went upstairs twice or thrice...
and saw the room door.
There were lots of amulets hanging
I didn't want to disturb that
and dent the belief of elders
Without opening the door
I came back
I was sure there was nothing to fear.
So I left when I got the e-mail
But from the day Chandramukhi's room
was opened...
this problem has started
As long as Saravanan is here
why do you fear?
Senthil didn't listen to me when I said not
to buy this house... or go in to the room
Day by day the problems
of this house increase
And everyone is suspecting you
Saravanan is the only one
who can solve these problems
That is why Senthilnathan
has called him here
Darga...
Not Darga. Durga
For some time...
can, t you talk fondly?
That time is the evening...
won, t love shower then?
Fondling time...
can, t you cross the limits?
This moment...
will it not extend little more?
Eyes are beautiful,
the beauty in hand is hundredfold
You make the world look beautiful
I am the beauty in you,
you are the beauty in me
Everything is so beautiful
Like Kannadasan, s lyrics...
our love would be immortal
Like Kamban, s Tamil...
it is forceful all the time
and will live forever
If you turn as rain
I, ll become the paddy field
And you would yield
Eyes hook fondly...
lips would peck
To rule all people by affection...
is there a guy like you?
As I don, t know to pretend...
even my desires would stumble
Regards of millions would praise you...
Future would yearn
You are in me, I am in you...
is it not true?
For some time...
Can, t you talk fondly?
That time is the evening...
Won, t love shower then?
Fondling time...
can, t you cross the limits?
This moment...
will it not extend little more?
Who allowed you inside?
Now look...
if you come here without permission,
I will kick you out of this town
Get lost
Who...?
Chandramukhi.
Why didn't you come to meet me?
Because you didn't come,
I have come looking for you
I know who you are! Get up
What do you want now?
- Just checking whether you are at home
At night, other than my house
where else would I be?
This is what is good for a family girl.
- I am happy that you have come back
But you shouldn't come
when grandpa is not here
Whatever it is, we can discuss
tomorrow morning. Now you go
Get lost!
You are my soul,
accept me Lord
Come as the breath
of my breath
Come, come and delight me
Saravanan, get up
What doctor, you are here?
You slept here last night?
I came late in the night
after the concert, so I slept here
What concert?
Carnatic, Bharata natyam, Kuchupudi.
Does anyone learn dancing upstairs?
No, no one is learning dance
Only during day they learn music
from Durga
Who is dancing at night?
Then last night, in the southern room who
was singing and dancing with anklets?
With anklets?
- Yes
Did you hear it really?
I told you, I heard it myself
I tried to open the door,
but it was bolted from inside
Bolted? No chance.
After I opened it
who would have locked it?
Besides, no one goes that side.
- Is it?
Then?
Then was the song and dance
my imagination?
I will have my tea later.
Come, let's go upstairs and check out
Oh God! I am not coming.
- Why?
They say it is because I went there
that all these problems have started
I am with you, why are you afraid?
Come
See, the door is not locked.
- Oh yes
Is this the Vettayapuram king's room?
Seems like he was a romantic
Money alone is not enough
Who is that?
Is he the Vettayapuram King?
He looks evil
Where is his courtesan's room?
- Who?
I mean his mistress
- Chandramukhi? Come, I will show you
This is Chandramukhi's room
Chandramukhi madam...
the fact that the king killed her
is quite understandable
Why?
What an eye, powerful nose!
Slim waist! Look at the complexion
How could anyone give away
such a beauty to anyone else?
Have you seen the room
where the dancer Gunasekaran lived?
Which Gunasekaran?
Oh! Her lover
Come, I will show you
Look... that's the one
So this is from where Chandramukhi
enticed Gunasekaran...
by singing "Come and delight me"
Chandramukhi's dresses and jewellery.
Don't you want to have a look?
My God! So heavy!
- Chandramukhi's sari
I will show you all her jewelry
Waist band
Coin chain
Forehead jewel... The anklets
There is only one...
what happened to the other?
Where will it go?
It must be somewhere around
My tea must have chilled by now.
Come, let's have it
The other day I saw both the anklets.
Where's the other?
I love black
That's my wife's voice
That means you like
your hubby very much
That's the doctor!
He is a gullible guy,
but I still like him
Why the silence?
Aim properly
What...? Aim properly?
Disburse everything first
Disburse? I wouldn't allow that
to happen till I am alive, doctor!
Were you talking about
carom board shuffling?
What else did you think?
- I thought otherwise
Saving all the ladies has become a big
assignment for all the males here
That too my duty is going overtime
You got to work overtime
Either you should be handsome, or you
shouldn't marry a beautiful woman
I can't talk or think about you.
How can I make a living at this rate?
There was a guy in one town...
- That is you!
Why are you still sitting here? Get up!
- I'm only half way through!
What do you want Senthil?
I've been very busy.
I have a severe headache
Please ask Ganga to make some coffee.
- Why Ganga? I will make it for you
I don't know why everyone
likes this doctor
How does he entice everyone?
My chicken. Today somehow I should
catch it and fry it!
For whom are you preparing coffee?
- For Senthil
I'll have it sent
I don't know where
this deaf fellow has gone
Go and get me my B.P. Tablets
I have kept coffee there,
give it to Senthil
Red coin is going
The black coin...
follows. Something's fishy
Who made this coffee?
- Durga
For whom?
- I think it is for Senthil
Senthil, don't drink that coffee!
Why did you do that?
- The coffee was poisoned
Poisoned?
You brought this coffee!
- My God! I don't know anything
Lakshmi madam only asked me
to give this coffee to you
I only prepared the coffee
but I don't know who mixed poison
Doctor, how do you know
this coffee is poisonous?
First you burnt Ganga's sari, now you
laced Senthil's coffee. I will...
Don't harm her. Whoever laced
this coffee, just remember
If anyone wants to harm
my friend or his wife...
as long as Saravanan is alive
it won't happen
Kandasamy sir, I will find out
who mixed poison in this coffee
Let her go... come Senthil.
Go! He said he will find out.
Go and do your work
Who?
What...? Is Ramaswami Acharya
from Chekkulam coming?
I am so happy.
Ok I will take care of everything
What are you thinking?
Are you upset?
Where are you? I have been
searching for you everywhere
No need to worry anymore. Ramachandran
Acharya has promised to come
Who is he?
- Haven't you heard of him?
He has traveled the world around.
He is an expert exorcist
Saravanan reads only the human mind.
He knows to control even spirits!
I told him about our problem.
He said he will come immediately
He is expected tomorrow. I have to go
and make arrangements to recieve him
That's a fraud. He'd ask us to conduct
rituals and charge heavily
It is all mere waste of time and money.
I don't encourage people like them
I am going to stop this.
- No Senthil
We shouldn't underestimate any one
I've heard about Ramachandra Acharya.
He is not an ordinary person
It is good one way, let him come
Welcome, Sire
Yes, we have a problem here
Place the chair facing east
Please sit down. It appears
to me as if God has come
Look...
- Yes, priest?
I may have to stay here for a week.
- By all means
My desciples would do
whatever I require
I would not drink even
water from this house
Another important thing.
During these 7 days...
no one from this house
should stay out
Who is he?
- My friend Saravanan
He is a psychiatrist.
He has no other work
So he was called to solve
the problems in this house
Forget all that. They say there is
someone called Chandramukhi here
Somehow issue a gate pass
and send her out
Where is my room?
- I will show you
Saravanan, I expect that once the
problems of this house are solved...
you should leave this place
You shouldn't come back and play
carom with Swarna
You can't anyway
Because next week I am taking her to
some temple, to shave her head
He doesn't even respond
I can also comb, my hair is
also untidy
I have a comb too, I'll get off now,
comb my hair and then scruffle it up
That's not me
Do you think this Rs 30 lakh car
is a saloon for you, stupid guy?
Why didn't you yell at him?
- This is for him too
He deserted me again!
Where did he go? What happened?
I don't know where I am!
I think I'll have to beg
Where did you go?
I was lamenting in the temple
You brought me here and left me
in the lurch. What do you mean by this?
You don't save the guy
who accompanies you?
Why do you look there? Answer me
Wait, I got hit with food and mud
I won't come.
- I won't leave this place
I'm coming
What a villain! Move it!
What Senthil? Drawing eh?
Just by drawing you earn so much.
What do you do with the money earned?
What happened? How did it break?
I didn't do it
I swear it was not me
It was not me
I don't know
I don't know how it fell
You pushed it down, are you now
trying to act innocent?
I did nothing. I didn't push it
You were the only one upstairs.
How could it fall on its own?
Didn't I warn you? Why did you come?
Why did you go upstairs?
Madam called me to wipe the spilt coffee
I don't know anything.
I've done nothing
I don't know, I...
What you don't know?
No, she must not be spared
She says she doesn't know
how it happened
We have to make sure that she is cured.
We should lock her up in a room, come
Let me go. Please believe me
I don't know anything. Leave me
Please believe me
I didn't try to kill him
Nothing is wrong with
my granddaughter. Please leave her
Because we are poor you have
made such an allegation on her
If you blame her like this
then who'll marry her?
Sir... listen to me sir!
I don't know anything
Whose anklet is that?
How did it come here?
I don't know whose anklet that is
I found it while sweeping
So I kept it there, that's all
Sir, what happened
to my grand daughter?
Why have you locked her inside?
What happened to her?
No tension... nothing to worry
I've given her a small treatment.
She is taking rest
Don't disturb her. Nothing
happens to her, I assure you
Did the coffee spill or
was it you who spilt it on purpose?
What are you doing here now?
What happened?
I am feeling sorry for Durga
Why?
Had I not asked for
Chandramukhi's room key that day...
all this wouldn't have happened to her
I've vowed to donate Rs. 5000 to
Goddess Mookambigai if she is cured
I forgot to tell you something.
You told me an anklet...
in Chandramukhi's room was missing.
It has been found
Where was it?
- In Durga's room
I knew it
This is Chandramukhi's anklet
You mean this was the anklet
used by Chandramukhi 150 years ago?
Yes.
- Then this is not the one
This anklet was made just 5 years back.
- No doctor. It is the same one
I am telling you, I know for a fact
that this is not the one
Don't behave as if
you know everything
I know what I'm saying.
I can prove it anywhere
Ganga, you know nothing about it.
- Me, do you mean me?
Why do you get so excited?
Why should we fight on it?
This belongs to Chandramukhi only
Why is she not listening to me?
Did you tease her?
No, she was feeling sorry for Durga
- For Durga?
Lt'll be alright. Come on
I have come like an angel
Dearl
Hearing the melody of times...
I stood spellboud, come
Youth and age has been endowed to me
I am a young girl
Come to delight me
Come to me
Youth and age has been
endowed to me
I am a young girl
Come and delight me
Come and delight me
Attention pleasel
His Highness Vettaya Raja is arriving
My soul is for you
Come on accept Lordl
You are my breath of breath
Who is it?
- It is me
Vettayan, your Vettayan
You?
- Yes, it is me
Open the door. Open the door, you dog!
How dare you come in here again?
Chandramukhi, what is it that want?
- I want only you
I've come to kill you!
You think you can do it?
- Yes, I can
Then kill me
Not today. If I don't burn you alive on
Durgashtami day, I am not Chandramukhi
But today is not Durgashtami day.
Then why have you come today?
Go from here and come
back on Durgashtami day. Go
I am going
What happened, sir?
- Someone has interfered with my pooja
I was planning to make Chandramukhi
appear in this area
Someone has deviated her
Why is coming unnecessarily
at this hour?
Was it you?
Was it you? You have made a big mistake
No, I've done something good
Don't try to challenge our beliefs
This is not a disease
to be cured by medication
This should be cured by exorcism
Ordinary doctors know nothing about this.
But Senthilnathan refuses to understand
What are you doing?
I've caught a cold,
I am taking an inhalation
Dreadful disease. It'll be cured
in a week if you take medicine
Without medication it goes off in 7 days
Sister-in-law, did you see my wife?
- No
Oh God! Where could she have gone?
You too seem to have a cold?
- Yes, for the past 2 days
This is a superb cure. Come sister,
we both can inhale the steam together
Brother, did you see my wife?
You saw your wife only after I saw her.
- What do you say?
Fool! When we went for a bride for you
I only saw your wife first
Don't press too much, it is suffocating
Sounds like my wife
Pull your legs inside. Close the gap
Oh God! To whom would I tell about
this atrocity? He's incorigible
Today, he plays carrom with her
inside a bedsheet. What can I do?
I'll not spare him today.
I'm sweating
Of course, you will
Doesn't your husband know about this?
- He's a wastrel!
You're right
Whatever it is, a doctor is a doctor
I've done this to so many
It was superb
Got to do this for 7 days.
- I feel much better
Super power!
Power? He is worse than the spirit
Greetings Priest
I've fixed my daughter's engagement
on 15th and marriage on 20th
The first invitation is for you.
Please shower your blessings
Won't the problems in the house
get solved before the marriage?
Don't worry. Your problems will be
solved in another 2 days' time
Thank you
Sister, I heard that you
won't attend the engagement
If I don't come, will you
stop the engagement?
You only asked to keep the engagement
on 16th and celebrate it pompously
Now I am asking you to stop it. Stop it
You could have told me then itself.
All the arrangements have been made now
I should have been the one to arrange
for your daughter's marriage
Not that doctor
I can't come
I bless, I bless the women folk
Mother of the bride, bolster up
Parents of the groom,
ask for the auspicious marriage
For a bright white smiling face...
our sun dynasty... don, t know where
it is foreordained
Broad face like a betel-leaf...
our moon dynasty... it is foreordained
Brother, s song...
come on dance
Listen carefully...
it has hundred canotations
Dance
Do, if you do it splendidly...
do it in a measured way
Yesterday has gone with the wind
Live today itself
That, s the best policy
Get into bondage with love
Forget not the truth
For hundred years...
live prosperously
Her shyness is similar
to plantain flower
But her mind is full of joy
No more sleep during night
The sari may not last on chest any more
That which are unknown...
will be understood tomorrow
In his breath, your saree will burn
A rousing cockerel is caught with a hen
That, s the best policy
Now watch this
Have a clear mind
Have noble thoughts
As long as you live...
respect your soil
Are there trees sans roots?
Stand on your own legs
Town will pay heed after you stand so
Don, t blow your own trumpet before that
At a split second...
anything could happen
I know this, you, ll realise it tomorrow
Place four inside five and tread
on your steps carefully
Brother, s song...
come on dance
If you listen with intent...
it has hundred canotations
Do, if you do splendidly...
do it in a measured way
Yesterday has gone with the wind
Live today itself
Where is Ganga?
Saravanan, where is Ganga?
Let's look for her
What were you trying to do?
I've done nothing, sir
Senthil, Ganga has become unconscious
Go and check on her first
Sir, I don't know what happened here
She only...
I know
I really don't know anything.
She only dragged my hand and...
I know you it's not your fault...
What are you doing here?
You misbehaved with my wife!
Are you trying to act innocent?
- Senthil don't be hasty...
Don't believe him. He has done
a big mistake and come in to the house
You are asking me to maintain
my composure. Get out
No, I didn't misbehave with your wife!
- You mean my wife did?
It was not his fault
It was really not his fault
- Then?
It was Ganga...
You mean to say Ganga advanced...?
Ganga desired?
No!
How could you talk bad about my Ganga?
How, how could you do it?
He chose him as the groom
That is why he is putting the blame on
your wife and trying to justify him
No madam... - Enough,
you needn't say anything further
Don't!
I had great regard for you as a doctor...
- Who, him a doctor?
He came to cheat us. Throw him out
Madam, in 2 days time I will solve
the problems of this house and leave
Who're you to solve our family problems?
We know how to resolve them
Listen...
- Go! Get out from here
Flirting with the womenfolk,
you had fun posing as a doctor
Your friend has realised what you are.
- Listen...
Senthil, don't be hasty.
- We know what to do. Go out
Mr Kandaswamy...
- Go, I told you!
Don't beat him, brother!
- He locked up my innocent grandaughter
Send him away
Wait for 2 more days.
Let me resolve the problems...
I have brought Ramachandra Acharya
just for that. He will take care
Get lost
Whom are you going to send out
from this house? This man?
If he goes out from this house
you'll have to face the problems
He misbehaved with our womenfolk...
- No
Don't speak. I know everything
He's needed here more than me
Wipe off your blood. The blood of a
good person shouldn't be spilt
Mere rituals cannot stop
what is happening here
Only his psychiatric
methods can succeed
That day when I did my rituals,
there was some hindrance
Then he came down the stairs.
Do you remember that?
That day, I could see the
enlightenment in his face
I could see the happiness of having
achieved something in his face
Later I met him privately
to find out what happened
When I heard what happened,
I trembled
If Ravana had ten heads...
he has 10 brains in one head
He is not an ordinary psychiatrist
He studied at U. S and
has got gold medals there
Besides he is the one of the
top students of world's greatest...
psychiatrist Dr. Bradley
You are all trying to send out
such a great man
He's still here after being insulted.
Do you know why?
Sir... - Quiet
Just because he blamed your wife
you decided to send him out of the house
Do you know he has saved
your wife at the risk of his life?
If you want your Ganga to live,
Saravanan has to die?
It's destiny
Is it shocking to you all?
Saravana tell your friend
what you told me
If your Ganga is to survive this
Saravanan should die. That is destiny
Be prepared for what
I am going to tell you Senthil
The person behind all the problems here
is not Durga or someone else
Then who is possessed
by Chandramukhi?
Your wife, Ganga
You called me back here and told me...
that Durga was the one behind
the problems of this house
I immediately realized
that it was not Durga
One night, at about 12 o'clock,
in Chandramukhi's room...
I heard someone
singing and dancing
On hearing my sound
the singing and dancing stopped
I was investigating as to
who could be behind all this
It was then that I went with your
wife Ganga to Chandramukhi's room
It was in the room that I saw a
peculiar change in her behaviour
Waist band and the coin chain
I had never seen
Ganga like that
She was in a psychic vibration
I knew at once, that the person
affected by Chandramukhi was Ganga
To confirm my conclusion, I showed
Ganga the missing anklet...
and lied to her saying
that they were not Chandramukhi's
Ganga you don't know,
this is not that one
At that moment, I saw Ganga
transform into Chandramukhi
Ganga you don't know any damn thing
about this
You mean me? Me, me?
Ok, relax. Why're you getting excited?
Yes Senthil, Ganga often transforms
into Chadramukhi
That is her problem
We have all read in papers that a 20 year
old girl talks like an old woman
A 5 year old boy behaves like his dead
grandfather. Same case
In medical terms, we refer to this
as Split Personality
That is, a stage where a person
behaves like another
a possessive state
Ganga has been affected by this
To find out how a mischevious girl
like Ganga can be affected by this...
I took your uncle to
her village Ellur
We all know only the
happy side of Ganga's life
Ganga has another side.
A traumatic past
This I came to know
only after going to her place
Ganga's father married a
lower caste lady
So he was excommunicated
by his people
When he died, they didn't even allow
Ganga's mother to cremate him
They wanted her to prostrate before
each one in the village
As she had no other choice
she undertook that punishment
She died with that humiliation
Right before Ganga's eyes both the
corpses were burnt by local people
Ganga became furious seeing the
atroctites perpetrated on her parents
And in her rage she
attacked the landlord and fainted
This was her first psychic disorder
Ganga who lost her parents at a young
age was taken in by her grandmother
The orphaned Ganga grew up hearing
her grandmother's old stories
Whatever story she heard,
she fantasied herself...
as the character in that story
I understood from my inquiries
it's a habit from her childhood
When she was in the 10th grade
her grandma fell sick
Without concentrating on her studies
she had sleepless nights
Next day, she couldn't write the exam
The sight of her throwing away her
answer sheets and running like a mad girl.
Was still vivid in the
mind of her class teacher
Her grandma didn't know she had a
problem like this and left it uncured
After her grandma's death, to avoid
her lonliness, she took to mischief
The stories that she heard at her
young age were deeply etched...
in her memories. That was why she
compelled you to buy this palace
Her innate mischievous character
made her enter Chandramukhi's room
Her innate weakness made
Chandramukhi's character enter Ganga
Ganga went to Chandramukhi's room
Ganga stood there as Chandramukhi
She believed she was Chandramukhi
Ganga transformed
into Chandramukhi
This is how Chandramukhi
possessed Ganga
I have never noticed
such a change in Ganga
She knows your sleep cycle. She knows
when you're awake, when you're asleep
To avoid any suspicision against her
she burnt her own sari...
and turned everyone's attention
towards Durga
It was Ganga who chased Priya
It was Ganga who mixed
poison in the coffee
It was Ganga who tried to
kill you with the fish tank
It was your wife Ganga who made
everyone think he raped her
Why? Why?
When Ganga transforms into
Chandramukhi...
she thinks that her lover Gunasekaran...
is this Viswanathan who is now living
in Gunasekaran's house
To prevent Priya from marrying him
she tried to kill her
She alleged him of raping her...
thinking that the marriage will
stop because of this
Why did she try to kill me twice?
When Ganga turns into Chandramukhi
she thinks Vishwanathan...
is her lover Gunasekaran.
The only person standing in her way...
is you. Ganga's husband
So she tried to kill you twice
When the fish tank fell and
everyone was agitated...
I saw Ganga unperturbed
At that moment I saw her
transform into Chandramukhi
To bring her back to reality...
I shouted at Durga and locked her
up inside the room
I told her everything about Ganga
Durga told me she was ready to accept
the blame even a 100 times...
for the sake of Ganga
Durga took the blame and
Ganga was able to roam freely
It was only to find out
Chandramukhi's intention...
that inspite of the priest's pooja,
I stood as the King before Chandramukhi
When I stood before her as the King
she believed me to be King Vettayan
She told me that her intention was to
kill me, the King and take her revenge
If this wish of Chandramuki is
not fulfilled, we will lose Ganga
So the person she is going to kill
on 'Durgashtami' day is...
Yes me.
She thinks I am King Vettaiyan
If Chandramukhi's wish is not
fulfilled, she would destroy herself
And in that process not
Chandramukhi our Ganga will die.
In this struggle, I don't know
whether I would...
save Ganga or lose myself
It's pity that Ganga
doesn't know that...
she is transforming into Chandramukhi
Senthil, open the door
Who locked the door from outside?
- May be Durga
Look... someone has torn my sari
Durga might have done that.
OK, how was the dance yesterday?
I don't remember doctor. I was sleepy
and I didn't know what happened
When did you come?
Did they offer you something to drink?
No, thanks
No one offers anything to
the prospective son-in-law
Wait, I'll bring you some coffee
See, she doesn't even know what
happened. - How horrible!
I tried to destroy you
But you have decided to sacrifice
your life for the sake of your friend
Now-a-days even children are not
grateful to their parents and...
they always expect something in return
But you have decided to sacrifice...
your life for the sake of
your foster parents family
I am so proud of you
So far I have never bowed before anyone
But I bow before you
Pardon me
Even though I have no son of my own...
God has given me a son
I have cured many people...
but have never seen
a case like this in my life
I don't know how you would
save yourself from Chandramukhi
Even the thought of it terrifies me
I can apply psychiatry effectively
to remove Chandramukhi from Ganga
But your pooja alone can
destroy Chandramukhi completely
You should perform a pooja
for the sake of Ganga
Certainly
Today is 'Durgashtami'
The day Chandramukhi is supposed
to take revenge on the king
Today Chandramukhi's
wish will be fulfilled
I'm going to return your
wife completely cured and safe
Didn't you say that you
saw her sleep peacefully?
Go and tell her that you both
are not staying here tonight
Tell her that you are going to the
next town to buy jewels for Priya
Why?
Just call her
Try calling her
Ganga...
we both are going to Madras today.
- Why?
We'll go to buy a gift for Priya
and return tomorrow
Today?
- Yes
Why today?
- To buy jewels...
tomorrow is a very nice day,
that's why we are leaving today
I am not coming.
- You are coming
I am not coming.
- You're coming
You should
Won't you leave me?
Won't you leave me?
You dog, how dare you order me?
If I don't avenge his death,
I'm not Chandramukhi.
What did I just do?
I did something now
I did something just now
No...
- Something is happening to me
Nothing is wrong with you.
- Please forgive me, don't punish me
No dear. You are my child
Forgive me.
- No dear
Forgive me
Forgive me if I've done anything wrong
Don't leave me.
- Oh God! Ganga
Forgive me.
- You are my darling. You are alright
You won't leave me, no?
Enough Saravanan,
please go away from this house
I can't bear my wife's plight
How can I bear the sight of her
killing my best friend? Please go
Will she become alright if I go?
I'll go somewhere far off to
America, Japan or China...
to some corner of the
world and cure her
For her sake, I cannot remain
quiet and let my friend die
I am a doctor. If I run off from
a patient for fear of my life...
then what is the use of my studies?
Even if you take her anywhere...
no one can cure her
Only I can cure her.
Because I know her completely
Don't worry, I am going to use
a new method in psychiatry...
to rescue Ganga from Chandramukhi.
I can definitely cure her
You will save Ganga, no doubts about it
But who'll rescue you
from Chandramukhi?
Why did you ask me to come?
- I'll tell. Senthil, come along
Come
This is King Vettaya's dance hall
This is where many years ago,
he burnt Chandramukhi alive
In that chakra (wheel) made by
Ramachandra Acharya for the pooja...
we should make Ganga sit
Only you can do that
Look at your wife, who has completely
transformed into Chandramukhi
Come, come
Come, and delight me
Come...
torment me
You are my soul,
accept me Lord
Come as the breath of my breath
Every night she dances like this
I have come like an angel...
my love
Hearing the melody of times...
I stood spellbound, come
Youth and age has endowed me,
I am an young girl
Come to satisfy my urges
This is a hot raging youth
Come, come
What is this bondage?
Is this a previous birth bondage?
Dream? Is it a dream?
Is this dance of angel a dream?
Listen to my plight due to separation
Are these stumbles your dream?
Those pleasantries
in my memory...
will I forget them easily?
Is this an unseen union of hearts?
Flirting doesn, t mean obscenity
I am a posh maiden
Come oh lightning beaul
Come, come
Pour the oil
No
Senthil, remember what I said.
Be strong, victory shall be ours
No... no
Bring her here
Who are you?
- I won't tell
Tell me, who are you?
- I won't tell
It is me, Chandramukhi
Go and sit there
Sit down
Why have you come?
- To kill
Whom? - That man!
Today is Durgashtami day,
I'll burn the king and take his ashes
Will you go away from
this body after you kill him?
I will go
Pour the oil on him
Here, kill him
Do it with your own hands
Slowly you, re gaining consciousness
open your eyes... goodl
What is your name?
- Ganga
Your full name?
- Ganga Senthilnathan
Who am I?
- Saravanan
Who is that?
Aunty...
As promised Saravanan has
brought the family together
He won't say. If he says
he'll honour his words
As promised I have handed
over your wife to you
If you like you may change
your bedroom to Chandramukhi's room
Or both of you may go to America
London, Japan...
or anywhere... not on treatment though.
- Then?
To sing a duet
Forget about them,
when are you going to sing?
I too have got one.
- Who is it?
My gosh!
Follow me. - Follow me?
For whom was this whistle?
- For my girl
Durga!
Thank God! My wife is safe
After a long time, a child's voice
is going to be heard in our house
Oh Lordl Lord of the seven hillsl
Look at us
Our folks, hearts are diamonds.
Come on burnish it
Repeatl
