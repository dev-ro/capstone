This story almost remained untold.
However, it deserves praise.
What is the good of telling it?
The water diviner's stick quivers
above the ground.
So severe was the winter of our tale,
frosts as passionate
as the Christianity of that time.
Better to huddle by the fire
and remember old times.
Foolishness is scattered aimlessly.
Why listen to it?
Is there sense in what was written?
For nothing, for poetry's sake...
and at the behest
of a wandering echo
and because the oldest things
lie in the present.
Part 1 - Straba
How two Kozlik brothers
hunted on the imperial road,
how the neighbour,
whose life was saved by piety,
turned this to good account.
Ask him how far it is to Boleslav.
One-armed-man!
How far is it to Boleslav?
How far is it?
Can't you hear me?
He's deaf, he can't understand.
He won't take any money.
He's stupid,
doesn't know what money is.
The idiot doesn't understand.
What's happened?
That one-armed man!
- I said what's happened?
- They stole the horses!
He attacked him, Heinrich!
Watch over the count!
Wait!
- Is he still alive?
- It's that rogue!
Stay there,
don't go with your father.
Christian, come back!
Only caught one hare the whole day -
a German one!
See that mare? Quite something!
They're counts from Saxony -
that one speaks Czech.
He's the old man's footman.
If we don't get rid of them
we can prepare for the chase!
Put him in fetters! Tie him up!
Stop, you beast! Mangy animal!
Greetings, Mr Lazar!
Greetings to you.
The beast's leg is bad.
I took a bit of harness here.
You know my loutish behaviour.
They wanted to know
what was going on here.
Surely not some misfortune?
They have to see everything
for themselves.
I said we had to go on,
but would they listen?
Shut up!
Pray!
God. Almighty God...
...be blessed for bringing hope
at the close of unhappiness.
You break souls like a potter
and mould them again.
For there is mercy
in the depths of Your anger.
You have permitted my sins
but do not allow your servant Mikolas
his mortal sins.
Remember my daughter Marketa
and deliver me from evil.
Without me, she will fall
to the impure worldly might.
About Kozlik,
Lord of Rohacek
who had eight sons
and nine daughters
and about the captive
destined for
the bishop of Hennau.
Jan!
Put the mare in the stable,
I don't need the stallion.
We have no oats to feed them.
Slaughter it!
Mikolas!
Go away!
Alexandra!
Adam, give me back that chain.
Who is that? Who is Lazar?
Carrion-vulture! Mange of dogs!
Where is your reason?
To let yourself be fleeced
by some ghost from the road?
I wasn't. He came and went...
took a few chains...
Why did you let him get away?
Why didn't you murder the vermin?
Without a prayer!
He had no weapon.
And those two,
they didn't have any either?
We can talk of ransom.
And you'll go and get it?
Or you'll invite his relations
from Saxony here?
They must go! Both of them!
If his father hadn't run off
you could've got them all.
Who has escaped?
Come with me!
And you, get out of here!
Why did you hide it from me?
So they escaped!
No-one ever escaped from you!
You dog-head!
Do you know what you've done?
Look! See?
So? You said they had to go.
We're perishing with cold.
Frozen to tatters.
If someone tries to get to us...
...for example...
through the window.
Adam, stop!
- But you said in the yard...
- Do what I told you!
How Kozlik fared in Boleslav
with the captain
of the royal regiment
(this man was once a merchant
who brewed from hops.
They called him "Beer").
Christ, captain, you wanted...
- Did the beasts run you through?
- My son...
The white one... see him?
Do you see them?
The white one!
We'll have nothing to do.
So? Why?
Take the boys and follow the track.
I left my knife and hat there.
You have no reason.
None at all.
- You're as hard as ice!
- I want a drink!
Couldn't Jan go to Boleslav?
You act as if you were 50!
Have them wake Mikolas.
They took your horses?
Where's the captain?
Where's your good man, people?
- What do you want with him?
- Lord...
The master is a noble but he steals.
- I come in good faith.
- No, you shed blood.
- You'll come to a bad end.
- Don't threaten me.
- Have a drink.
- I came to talk.
Too late -
the royal patience has run out.
Since when has the king bothered
with poor yeomen?
Even a king must drive flies
from his face.
You want to trap them, captain?
I'm glad the regiment
doesn't have to hunt you down.
Guards!
In vain do you vaunt, pedlar!
Oh God!
You old hag!
What have you got
against the captain?
I couldn't find...
...the chink in his armour.
God's will was not with me.
About the visit
to the neighbour at Oboriste
and what
Lazar's daughter saw.
Where is the master... wise people?
Come out, Lazar.
Welcome your guest.
Or shall I help you, you fox!
Welcome to Oboriste, son.
Hurry up, things are looking bad.
The king's captain has left Boleslav.
But if we lay in wait
for him together.
- Near the place where...
- Why me?
...where I gave you your life!
I've nothing to do with the king.
I don't kill.
You inherited that?
The king knows about you,
highwayman.
- If his soldiers get you...
- I'll redeem myself!
At confession!
But don't rely on royal mercy!
The king is just.
Those who stop his regiment
will hang along the road!
Gracious God, Mary and Jesus!
If You are all-powerful,
show Your strength at Oboriste.
Make my father change. Do this!
- You scoundrel!
- Thieving carrion!
Stop, that's enough!
Leave him alone!
You've made a mistake,
you scoundrels.
Don't you know that Kozlik
has more sons than sheep?
God, Marketa!
Well, you wouldn't...
I wouldn't be any the richer
for killing him.
Leave him be, let him go.
Let him perish in the confessional!
Such a pagan cannot speak
honourably to the king.
Get out of the way, fool!
Marketa! Do you hear me?
Don't believe him!
I never spilled blood.
Maybe in defence.
To take what a wealthy man leaves...
who isn't weak?
God allows the just to trespass
seven times daily
as it is in Heaven.
And here on Earth,
what you don't take,
you don't have.
Don't be rash with your thoughts.
Even God's love is stronger
than His holy justice.
Learn to forgive.
Learn to forgive.
Ask almighty God to forgive us.
God will hear
the one promised to Him.
He will not refuse you.
About Kozlik's retreat.
From Rohacek
and the fall of his son
and daughter Alexandra.
- Get that horse!
- What is it?
- Lazar's scoundrels!
- All should be killed!
- Father!
- He deserves it!
You look a sight!
- Lazar will pay for this.
- Leave the debts of others!
- Why did he go there?
- He stood against them by himself!
Christian!
Lazar's dogs are scared
of their own wind!
You're going to leave Lazar
to the will of God?
You want revenge?
The captain's after us
and you want to burn Lazar?
Be silent, count.
Be glad they don't see us.
- We'll get you by dawn.
- Lazar won't escape us.
Anger melts with the snow.
It'll be your shame.
Don't call the Grim Reaper,
get to the carts!
You'll fall into
the captain's hands, Jan!
Harness the horses!
- He's on the way to Lazar.
- By the time he gets here...
- He'll never find Oboriste!
- Come out.
Asses!
Where did you see the regiment?
- Half a day away.
- What do you mean?
- In deep snow...
- Go on!
Maybe it'll take a day.
It won't be good
if the captain settles in Oboriste.
Seven, no more!
That's quite enough
for that Oboriste vermin!
And I want Lazar alive!
Do you understand? Alive!
And spare the horses!
Did you kill at least one,
mutton-head?
I didn't expect this of you.
- What are you still doing here?
- Bring the horses...
Move it!
Go on!
You didn't really
do away with a soul?
- This is our affair.
- I want him to go with us.
About the campaign
which became a funeral,
how the captain reflected
on the death of his aide
who fell at the hands
of the sons of Kozlik before Oboriste.
He is buried at Rohacek.
- You can't go into the yard!
- Just to feed the coal-tits!
Don't go into the courtyard!
Have you no reason?
Half the amount of meat
would suffice.
And the spices...
What have I done?
The granary and the larder are empty
and spring is still far off!
In Kozlik's league?
You didn't want that!
What league?
Push the devil out
and the demon slips in.
It's frosty!
The way will be firm.
Like a hammer.
Something is fragrant...
- It's arnica.
- Colt's-foot and butterbur.
The marshes are frozen.
Butterbur is a healer.
- I know, maiden Marketa.
- You're not leaving?
Don't worry, I won't leave
your little nest exposed.
You won't catch up with Kozlik
in the woods.
The king's law is longer
than Kozlik's course.
I'm from a good line.
I know
what my coat-of-arms commands.
Your property and Marketa
are under my protection.
- Dear Sovicka.
- Does it hurt?
- Your hand is blessed.
- Such healers are rare.
- God bless you!
- Not a healer but an angel!
- Who hurt your heart?
- The Angel of mercy.
You can't do that!
A sincere mind does not seek words.
A bird's breast weighs heavily
on the knight's heart!
So longs as some remains
when I signal the attack.
The time has come, captain.
I see you mean business, marshal!
Your advice always was
good for nothing!
What is there to advise, pedlar?
You lead your regiment
like cattle from shed to shed.
- Some heroism!
- The king needs the law upheld.
The king entrusted
the captain's mace to me.
I travel the land
waging a merchant's war.
While your noble words
lead you to the mortuary,
one gabbles on, the other murders.
What did Kozlik want?
- If I sell my horses.
- So you're riding now?
I'm not giving my geldings
mere straw.
They will not last till spring.
You deny us a few oats?
Who knows whose they are?
Royal protection isn't gratuitous -
hunger follows...
You do well,
we know about your tricks.
- Just evil tongues.
- That's as may be.
Don't come to a bad end
like your neighbour.
Catch him! Kill him! Shut the gates!
Stop staring and go to bed!
We didn't come here a courting.
Rohacek is empty, captain.
- The birds have flown!
- Shall we join the trail?
It's fresh.
Haste is not a good helper.
Why do you punish me?
So many people to feed!
- The horses!
- Horses for the cornet!
Where to put them all?
They won't help us!
From mud to puddles.
Some reinforcements!
They're travelling without provisions.
You reproached me
for foolishness and imprudence.
You're waiting for reinforcements?
You count horsemen
like you count groschen.
Well observed, Sovicka.
Wait, that doesn't look like...
But they are not...
The king entrusted me
with his soldiers.
- Your blood has frozen, captain.
- I don't pay heed to it!
- Halt!
- Fear is in command!
Halt, you damned soul!
See that fool?
Won't even take a fur!
- You sniffing around, captain?
- Looking for silver, pedlar?
- Mangy dogs!
- Off to the devil with you!
- But leave us Lazar!
- We're lighting his way!
- Devious pole-cats!
- Run far from Rohacek!
Or we'll slice your veins!
- Just try, swine-murderer.
- We'll make a gelding of you!
Come out, show yourself, wretch!
- I've stuffed myself enough!
- You bloated pedlar!
I'll find you
and shove you on the stake!
I'll get you all
and murder you without mercy!
And I'll cast your limbs
into the woods, whore-mongers!
- You're repulsive!
- Sons of whores!
God will show us the way,
punishment must not delay!
No soldiers will rest,
nor animals, nor arms.
I shall hunt them as never before.
Lf, defending themselves,
they are killed,
I shall take their children!
How Lazar, rid of his worries
with his neighbour
(whom the captain hunts
through the woods)
Gives away his daughter
without a dowry.
Master Lazar.
His reason has been dulled.
His words are unaccountable.
He brays like a donkey.
God has also given you
a graceful daughter.
And a fool instead of an heir.
That is blasphemy.
I give you what is most dear.
She is looking forward to staying.
She has bid farewell to all at home.
Long yearning - great joy.
She will see.
It's not long before Easter.
I also took the habit
before our Lord rose from the dead.
Don't take me for a bad man.
We had a bad year.
The soldiers came
and you know about my neighbour.
Farmers who were not affected
are more affluent now.
God knows her dowry must be fitting.
Her casket is full,
she shall have groschen.
- But my estate is lost.
- We are not your confessors.
When the last snows are gone,
you will be with us.
Come, child.
I shall have sheep, too.
If the cloister waits.
- As the good Lord is above me.
- The just Lord.
The all-knowing.
May your house be filled
with health and happiness.
May your oxen thrive.
Give me a groschen!
- If you've something to give.
- Hear him? Vagabond!
My feet are frozen.
The monasteries used to be poor,
but now?
People only take.
Why are you sorry?
There will be no children
to carry on the line.
You promised me yourself.
It'll be sad here without you.
What have we here?
It could be mended.
The Lord taketh away,
the Lord giveth.
See her? She's a nun!
Slow down!
Praise to the Lord.
The thaw is coming.
For the mercy of God...
Boys, do not act like beasts of prey!
Why do you take revenge?
Mikolas!
Take pity on us!
Remember the Lord!
Lord, have mercy on these wretches!
I'll never forget this, Mikolas!
Have mercy!
Enough!
We are at your mercy
and cannot protect ourselves.
Don't commit murder!
- I'll redeem myself!
- With what?
For God's sake, no!
Take what you want
but don't harm Marketa!
Don't be an animal!
She has been promised to God!
My lord enabled me
to pay back my debt.
Since you're tolerant
and you'll be my creditor,
grant us this virgin.
The good Lord is glad to share her!
You can't do that!
Get up.
Come on.
He is thirsty for blood.
- Why is he crying?
- He mocks people and himself.
They threw his mother to the wolves.
He grew up with the wolves
and became one among people.
Disdain fosters his pride,
dislike breathes hatred.
Scorned by all,
Straba scorns them all in turn.
With a grimace he disgraced
the holy ancestral places.
He does not want
to be a subject of people or God.
He's free like a wolf,
but he has a human heart
and that heart is full of sorrow.
He grew up and the men
would have him cast out.
- Their word is law.
- What happened to him?
He heard the men's counsel
and laughed.
The quiet laugh of a wolf.
He was beautiful -
he chose the most comely maiden.
She was afraid of him,
and of her father even more.
The father decides
to whom you will be submissive.
Straba raged
and spilled blood from her throat.
They flew upon him
and put him in irons.
A terrible punishment awaited him.
The stake, said one,
trampled by stallions, said another.
They could not decide
how he should die.
Then the oldest of the line
pronounced the sentence.
May he have no place among
humans, free as a wolf.
His punishment would be in himself.
Perun cast down lightning,
but there were no clouds.
And Straba?
He laughs
with the quiet laugh of the wolf.
He leaves and bares his teeth
with that laugh.
Arrows had no power over him,
he was free as a wolf.
His life was not measured
by the solstices.
But he was alone.
Delight passed him by,
as it was not paid for by suffering.
Life has no value without pain.
At that time, he longed for pain,
he sought death.
He returned to that line
that cast him out.
But they had all grown old
and did not know him.
The young men flew at him with arms.
One remembered and shouted,
"Keep away from him!"
He has come for death
and we shall deny it him.
All retreated and mocked him.
He returned to die
and death was denied him.
Their mockery burned.
He shook like an aspen leaf.
He sought the place
where his heart was.
He seized the nearest knife
and stabbed into it.
But the knife broke
and no blood was drawn.
He was alone again.
Does he weep?
No. Weeping is the gift of relief.
The men know nothing about it.
Their pride pursues
eternal punishment.
Straba is from their line.
His ancestor came
from the woman he wed.
Shut up, old hag! Don't lure evil.
All of you
bear the mark of his blood.
But the curse cannot
touch the seventh son.
What are you doing?
- Why is there no guard?
- The captain has crossed the ford.
- Look!
- Where?
What disorder there is here!
Where are you supposed to be?
Are you guarding?
Where did that whore come from?
Make her wear the nails.
Let her run to the devil!
Why didn't you bring me Lazar?!
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you do it?
Such dishonour!
Act with chivalry!
Don't torture a defenceless girl.
I offer you
my share of the inheritance.
Christian!
Get away from me!
What are you doing here? Fools!
You whores!
Chains!
Bring the chains!
Part II - The Lamb Of God
Spring was approaching with haste.
Shepherds and wayfarers
began to talk animatedly
for the sun angels
could be heard in the wind.
Who thought now
of a sad maiden's tale?
Who would heed
the mad ramblings of louts?
The Lord, returning
to the welcoming lowlands,
fixes His gaze on the simplicity
of those who address Him.
What are you singing?
What are you muttering?
- A prayer.
- That's no prayer.
It's a sermon.
I don't know, I don't understand...
Are you not dwelling
in sodomitical sin?
You know she's not a woman,
as you are no lamb.
God won't hear that!
If only your voice were as good
as your simplicity is great!
You see?
The Lord is showing us the way.
We'll have milk and warmth,
perhaps a nice apple.
Come on, don't stand there.
We're just in time.
Is it a christening or a wedding?
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost,
Christ's holy intercessors lift their
hands for your sins to be forgiven.
The priest's prayers
rise up to the clouds.
What a wonderful estate
you have here!
Step back a little.
May this house be filled
with health and happiness.
Firstly, my lord...
What is it, my little one?
May your oxen thrive.
Give me a groschen!
If you've something to give,
don't leave me with nothing.
My feet are frozen.
I don't understand you
but you have a nice lamb.
Only a sheep sent to me
by a higher will.
But you've found yourself
a nice sheepfold!
- You got away in time!
- From puddles to mud!
St. George, a just patron.
Where is the master?
You're out of luck.
He was nailed to the gate!
And he dragged the sheep away
on a string!
- What are you muttering?
- That you've come just in time!
How Bernard found a soldier
who robbed him
and what became of the jests
of Kozlik's sons.
Oh Lord, those swines!
God, don't allow...
Thieves... louts... stinking swine!
They've encircled me...
they're strong as oxen...
What are they doing?
Mangy animals!
Swept away to the hellish world!
Keep us away
from those mangy hands!
Murder with terror
until they are silenced!
May they die!
Holy Christ...
my little one, where are you?
Where did you put her?
Did St. George help you?
They'll rejoice
for You have lost an impious soul.
Where is my sheep?
Fool!
My little one...
The impious are preparing
their bows and arrows.
His mouth is full of evil words
and cunning.
Your soldiering is finished,
you swine! My little one!
God... where are you? My little one!
Where the devil?
Come out!
Come out I say!
Foolish beast!
You have no reason.
The devil take you!
Get out of here
and take the mares with you!
The birdie has been caught!
Wretched beast! Outrun him!
You won't escape, you fool!
Faster, beast!
- Kill him, the wretch!
- The mares!
Hold him!
Use the knife!
What about the catch? And the others?
The carts? The provisions?
- Captain!
- What will I give the mares?
He murdered my son. Kill him!
- Stop!
- Where is my son?
Where have you buried him?!
Stop, I tell you!
You won't get away.
Give me a dagger!
You, get up.
That's him!
There's no need for haste.
You belong to the yeoman
they call Kozlik?
Is he dumb?
Tie him to the saddle!
He'll lead us there.
He'll get his due!
- Have him thrown to the dogs!
- Let us continue!
I order you!
What is this supposed to mean?
Why should this dog live?
Let us carry on!
About the scourge on the chain
and Mikolas' awakened memories.
Alexandra's noble beloved
and about the revenge of Adam,
the one-armed man.
Drahus!
Come out!
Give the falcons one each.
And give the buzzard two.
Hasten the beast.
What are you lurking around here for?
Get off home with you!
You hunting without blood-hounds?
He found his hunting-ground
in a mouse hole!
You must know that we are bound
to him with fetters.
Tell him we'll share this suffering.
It is God's wish.
My lord would like
to express his thoughts.
We wish to share with you
the adversity of fate.
It is only courteous.
We hope God will praise us
for it one day.
His blood is poisoned
by an impure deed.
God marked his left arm.
Exorcism did nothing.
Adam will die, Kozlik!
Take him out to the yard,
bring Alexandra.
You will look into
your brother's face until he dies.
Then you will be buried with him.
If he is saved,
you will be protected, too.
God will decide... the outcome.
Stop! Get back, you beast!
Where's he dragged us?
Stop!
Halt!
Give that here!
- Leave some for the journey!
- There's not far to go.
We're nearly at Rohacek.
Give him to us, captain!
That scourge is mine!
I'll do with him what I will!
The king gave me a decree
and you are his servant!
Give the rogue up! I order you!
I tell you, I won't let this through!
Must we beg you, captain?
About the last supper
where Bernard's sheep dies
and about the hour
in which death governs.
Who have you dragged here?
You clown!
And you, come out.
Come out into God's light!
Lament, you boars!
Repent for your atrocities.
Adam sends a confessor!
What are you?
They took my sheep.
I travel the world
and people give us bread.
Who sent you?
God.
They laugh when I speak to my sheep.
God's wisdom
pressed us into the dust.
We recognise love
and the Creator in this lovely world.
- Let us pray...
- Wait!
Not so hasty!
- Pour some wine.
- Where is that urchin?
Don't leave him standing there.
Your Simon's a lot of use!
- Did you rub down the horses?
- There's lots of straw.
- I hope his skull freezes!
- He could do it for Stepanka.
Just look after the spit!
- We have an unchristened child.
- God bless, noble lady!
If your soul is merciful,
do it for us.
I will. Give me grain,
salt, holy water.
Don't you use wine?
Not always.
Come here.
Have some!
- Am I to?
- Drain the jug!
To your health!
- Father, I'll take you.
- Thank the Lord!
- This way, Father!
- Very nice!
He likes his drink, doesn't he?
- You slumber early.
- The fields are barren.
- Like birds in heaven.
- Are you hungry?
Like a meadow lily.
Like a lamb of God.
Have a drink,
you, with the golden voice!
- Think of the children!
- What do you want?
- Am I to give myself up?
- What will become of them?
- Mind your own affairs!
- God's ways are unclear!
What will become of them?
Wolves!
If it weren't for all his aides...
The captain's either died
or he's run off.
Where's he lurking?
At our neighbour's.
- You destroyed his property.
- He deserved it.
May God judge you.
You're calling God - against whom?
- May the saints protect you.
- Why are you calling Him?
- The captain is not far.
- Do I hear you right?
Are you trying to threaten me?
- Think of your salvation.
- Think of yours, you old witch!
- Age has dulled our reason.
- I don't deny my sins.
I held my sword
but I never harmed the defenceless.
Keep quiet!
My deeds will terrify me
at the Last Judgment!
I shall be afraid but not ashamed!
I led wars with men -
against the king's will.
For ten years he rebuked me
with armed men.
I answered them as I would an enemy.
My sword is not shorter
than the captain's.
Get up!
Wake up the Father!
Such rabble!
My little one.
Open up! I want to talk to Father.
- I'm listening.
- I heard the sign of the wolf.
Black beasts and deer
are approaching.
- Get the saddles ready.
- It was a warning!
- Get up!
- Are you not scared?
Stop!
Come back!
Come here!
Throw them the chains as a reminder.
Take the horses
to where the stream forks.
Don't move until I say so.
Take Jiri with you.
No, I'll send Mikolas.
Silence!
Silence, I say!
God be with you and hurry!
Have them take the lamb with them!
Why do you constantly try me?
Why can I not swallow
my sinful saliva?
In the name of God and the king,
yeoman Kozlik, known as "the Goat".
The guardian of justice
speaks with you.
Our lord and king.
Put down your arms -
your iniquity is ended.
Go back home to Boleslav!
My gates are strong
and I've lost the key!
You have wronged
the young bishop of Hennau.
The king demands to know
what you have done with him.
Answer and give yourself up!
The king is the lord of us all.
But war is the lord of kings.
War is the judge of my actions.
I may defeat your troops
and talk with the king's envoy.
Perhaps I will be defeated
and killed.
According to the right of victory.
May your message
be carried away by the wind.
Halt!
War is declared and I have no scribe!
Thieving louts!
If you do not yield,
you will be killed!
And your family will be starved!
Before I storm your castle,
I'll kill one of yours as a warning!
He is my captive,
I'll bring him to the emperor!
I know nothing of the emperor!
- Take him, boys.
- We will bargain!
If you wrong my son,
they'll need a new bishop!
What are you waiting for?
Finish him off!
My son, he lives!
Negotiate with them, captain!
Back - don't move!
I want my son!
Away from him!
Kill him, Father!
Into line!
My son!
Into line. Get back!
Here you are!
Stupid, mangy, foolish!
Cornet!
Kill them!
Get them and come back!
Get what you can! The animals!
What have you got in your hands?
- Make a ladder!
- Change mounts!
Dismount, dismount!
Get them all into one!
Get the ropes!
I'll show you!
See that?
How love guided
the bishop of Hennau
and about
the soliloquy of madmen.
Kill her!
Murderess!
She's a witch!
She has bewitched you
with her magic!
- Renounce her!
- She's having my child.
You fool!
Concubine!
I know you better
than your own heart!
Leave that fury!
What do you want with her?
Her hair is full of lice
and she is evil smelling!
Let her run!
They got you drunk... the beasts!
Have some.
It won't do you any harm.
You haven't got a bit of salt,
have you?
We defend ourselves in need,
like a she-bear
and at another time
we'll fall upon you like a lynx!
Why do you appeal to God?
They made a lout into a lord.
Get up! Let's go and find shelter.
Once they invited me
to supper in a monastery.
It was Easter. Whores of Herod!
Louts with swords
to cast out a beggar...
What was its name?
The monastery
was on the Turnov road.
You don't know it?
Suddenly it was full of soldiers,
I was hungry.
Captain! Cornets... Drums...
Bad farmers clear woods -
bad kings start wars.
Don't make such noble faces.
You're all pagans.
In a Boleslav inn
they tried to stifle me!
Such henchmen they were!
Stop staring like a fish!
Can you hear me?
Stop staring.
Christ! Saviour!
Dear Virgin!
Give him water.
His head was cracked in two.
But he didn't even dismount his horse.
He just put loam on his wound
and rode home!
- The gallows await him.
- You mean the axe!
Noble blood gets the sword.
On the fate of men
and the lot of widows.
Mistress Katerina!
It's master Mikolas!
Praise be to God,
at least you are here!
Come and rest!
We haven't got that horse any more.
- I didn't expect...
- You don't know whether...
What about Jiri?
- And Burjan?
- Did you see mine?
Yes I did.
- Eat this.
- Are you fishing?
- Whatever the flood brings.
- I'd sell some in Boleslav.
What are you thinking of?
We wouldn't get past the gates
without wares.
- Why Boleslav?
- Is he alive?
He's no use otherwise.
I know what Kozlik would command.
We'll go in with a basket of fish.
Like farmers
and we'll charge the prison.
He'd tell you
to hide from the king's wrath
and return later
to build Rohacek again.
Attack the prison with stones?
We two?
One wolf defeats a pack of dogs
when the time is right.
We'll storm Boleslav!
Stick to fishing - with the regiment!
Kozlik is dead.
If not, he will receive the axe.
No power but God's
will drag him from death!
- Then God will guide us.
- He sinned like soldiers.
Wish him a peaceful death
to pay for his sins.
You want the executioner to take him?
We are both old and we await death.
You protect yourselves and your line.
Allow the aged a peaceful grave.
Remember the living!
The young shall sow the seeds.
Continue along this road.
Go, return home.
I took you from Oboriste
against your will.
No-one will reproach you.
Go, soften Lazar and wait.
I know everything that happened,
that you are sad,
that you love me but we must save
Kozlik from dishonour.
Your names are signed in hell -
be accursed!
- Don't blaspheme!
- May you never know peace!
Don't call God. He'll hear you!
Their time had come.
Kozlik said, "Take the arrows."
I went to him,
I couldn't see the way.
They called to each other.
When their time comes,
they battle for a mate.
- To overcome her?
- No, a mate calls his mate.
- And she?
- She submits to the stronger.
Forever?
- Only people know...
- And the defeated?
He knew... our scent.
Kozlik wouldn't have me shoot him.
- Why is he called "the Goat"?
- We always called him that.
- He once beat me hard.
- What happened then?
His antlers were bigger
than branches.
He looked at us without fear.
Kozlik motioned for silence,
we went nearer.
It moved off and we went after it.
Below the hillside was a bare plain.
Grass, stones, lichen...
This valley was more wretched
than a cemetery.
Bones, limbs - a thousand antlers
on white skulls.
He stood alone in the middle.
Defeated, alone.
Kozlik whispered,
"Look, the solitude of death."
He lifted his horn and blew into it.
- Who did he call to battle?
- Silence!
Just a moment longer.
Take Alexandra with you.
Your eyes are far away
where punishment awaits.
What about me?
We haven't given up yet.
I will be judged again and again,
even if I am wronged.
Do not talk of punishment
and prepare the wedding.
My brothers will bring you
a message from me.
God made me love you.
You are my wife.
Welcome...
You are...
Get back...
You whores! Get out!
This is not the time to return.
What are you doing here?
He sent you.
You could have come long ago
but you liked to sin!
You're his concubine!
Look!
I cannot look at you
writhing in ashes.
- I didn't leave of my own will.
- Really?
Who defended me?
You come with reproach
instead of repentance?
I came for you to judge me.
Do not judge
and you will not be judged.
Ask God for more humility.
You have not renounced him.
Go! You broke your vow to God!
You are not fit
even to feed the swine!
You'll be back, the pain will pass.
I'll speak for you
when the time is opportune.
Wait!
What have you done?
- Murderess! My child!
- What are you saying?
You were my guiding light...
Do not abandon me,
Lord, my Saviour.
Remember not my sins,
but remember me, by Your mercy.
Though my parents have left me,
your hand welcomes me...
... for my wrongs have risen
above my head like a stone.
I cannot bear them...
You measured the days,
nothing lies before You.
It is nothing more than vanity
for every man.
Man is transient as a shadow.
He hurries in vain.
He gathers
and knows not who takes.
Judge me, Lord, I abide
and hope in Your sincerity.
Try me, burn my loins and my heart.
The suffering of my heart
becomes greater.
Lead me from my anguish.
Teach me about your path.
Lead me to those who guard me.
Do not give me
to the desires of my enemies.
For he who breathes cruelty
should stand against me.
Do not unite my soul
with the sinful...
... and the murderous man
of my life.
In his hands is ignobleness.
His right hand is full of spoils.
Extend your hand from the heights.
Thunder crashes -
burning coals fall on him.
Throw him onto the fire...
...into a deep pit.
So he can no longer stand.
Remember Your mercy, Lord...
...and the charity
You have shown through the ages.
See my suffering
and wretchedness...
... and do not walk away from me...
Your hand presses down
heavily on me.
Take Your rod away from me.
From Your blows I have perished.
My heart has melted
like wax inside me.
My strength is parched
and my tongue clings to my mouth.
For You have placed me
in the dust of death.
For You have placed me
in the dust of death.
My wounds have festered...
... for my foolishness.
Lead me in justice
from those who watch me.
The dead do not remember you.
For who will celebrate
Your name in the grave?
Extend Your hand from the heights.
Thunder crashes,
burning coals fall on him...
Marketa Lazarova,
do you take Mikolas, son of Kozlik,
to be your true husband?
Yes!
Mikolas, do you take Marketa,
daughter of Lazar,
I bind your hands
with the sanctity of matrimony.
Whom God has joined,
may no man put asunder.
Let's go!
You were my dearest.
What have we here? Greetings.
Just in time,
we'll find something better.
Stand still, my little one...
It was mournful at Oboriste.
Stand still!
I found her, starved.
What are you doing here?
Come on,
let us three wander together.
God will find shelter for us.
It'll be merry in winter.
What do you say?
Where are you off to? Marketa!
Stop, I say! Where are you running?
Wait! I'll beat you with my stick...
Is that all the thanks I get
for saving you from a knife?
Marketa!
Stop, you smelly goat, stop!
Wait! Marketa!
After some time
this lady bore a son, Vaclav.
Alexandra also gave birth
and Marketa nursed both children.
They grew up to be fine boys
but love and certainty fought
with cruelty and doubt
for their souls.
