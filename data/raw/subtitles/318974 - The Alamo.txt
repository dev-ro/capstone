(speaking Spanish)
Gregorio. Gregorio!
(thunder)
They're all dead!
Oh, God, they're all dead!
Massacred!
The Alamo has fallen!
They're dead, all of them!
They're all dead at the Alamo!
(man) Did you hear what he said?
(men shouting)
The Alamo!
(sobs)
(softly) Take the oath for militia duty,
and you will receive 640 acres...
640 acres of your own...
of your own choosing.
640 acres of your own choosing.
That's better.
(? ''String Quartet No.5'' by Haydn)
Smooth.
lf it doesn't burn going down,
how can you be sure it's bad for you?
l'll be interested to see you gentlemen
when you arrive in Texas
and have your first taste of mescal.
ls it true that men and women
imbathe together out in the open?
Cleanliness is next to godliness.
Yes, well... excuse us.
lnvest now, gentlemen,
or lament later.
l'm a screamer.
l got the roughest racehorse,
the prettiest sister,
the surest rifle and the ugliest dog
in the district.
My old man could lick
anybody in Tennessee,
and l could lick my old man.
l can outgrin a panther
and ride on a lightnin' bolt,
tote a steamboat on my back
and whip my weight in wildcats.
Whip my weight in wildcats.
Whip my weight in wildcats. Whip...
- What is it?
- He's here.
- Who's here?
- He is here!
(man) Five minutes!
l'll tell you, these old bones
could sure use a respite.
'Course, the good citizens of Tennessee
may grant me that wish come next election.
- No!
- (laughter)
- Excuse me one moment.
- Yes. Yes, of course.
Sam Houston.
Makin' friends wherever you go.
- To Tennessee.
- Oh, to hell with Tennessee.
To Texas.
(man) lt's sad, isn't it?
A year ago, we'd be looking at two men
with their caps set for the White House.
Now...
What you peddlin', Sam?
Somethin' a certain Congressman
might need before long.
Are you sellin' rockin' chairs?
l'm sellin' Texas.
And what would l want with Norte Mexico?
David, you remember
what Tennessee was?
You come to Texas.
Timber, water, game, cattle,
more land than you can possibly imagine.
You take the oath for militia duty, you will
receive 640 acres of your own choosing.
- My own choosing?
- Mm-hmm.
Sam! You figure this new republic's
gonna need a president?
(music ends)
(man clears throat)
Before we begin tonight's performance,
l should like to acknowledge
the presence of the man
whose life inspired our humble play.
Good evening, Mr. Crockett.
Good evening, Mr. Crockett.
(laughter. applause)
(Scotsman)
You want to call me an opportunist?
Hell, yes, call me an opportunist.
But taking the Alamo
changed everything.
- We're in control now.
- (men) Yes!
We swore allegiance to Mexico
under the Federalist Constitution of 1 824.
Santa Anna tore that document up
personally, did he not?
Named himself supreme dictator?
Well, l, for one, ain't swearin' allegiance
to no son-of-a-bitch dictator.
(several) Yeah!
(man) Neither am l.
(Mexican accent)
Time to go, General.
They are talking crazy.
Drunk back sober.
lt's a miracle of the first order.
Seguin, why'd they put me in charge
of the army if they won't listen to me?
We need to muster and train troops here,
not send soldiers all over Texas.
ldiots. They think Santa Anna's just gonna
hand over part of Mexico without a fight?
(men shouting)
They are gonna want you humble,
General.
l humble myself before God,
and there the list ends.
To march an expedition
between here and Matamoros
- is lunacy!
- (men shouting)
You do not split an army
into vagabond militias
that march off on the slightest pretext
like bloodthirsty rabble.
Do you really believe this war is over?
You opposed Bexar, but victory was ours!
(men) Yeah!
And now you oppose Matamoros,
where victory will be as sweet.
No.
Perhaps, sir, you simply
oppose fighting.
Fighters shall lead the new country
of Texas, sir.
The council will now consider
the removal of General Houston
from command of the regular army.
- All in favor, show of hands.
- (majority) Aye!
The late, great Sam Houston,
former governor of Tennessee
and now former general
of the Texian army.
- Scottish catamite.
- What did you say?
l called you a Scottish catamite, Grant.
One step down from associate pederast.
- All right.
- (man) Remain clothed!
Come for me! Come! Come!
Any excuse to start removin' your clothes,
is that right, Houston?
This is not your concern, Mr. Bowie.
lndeed. This is between me
and the Scottish catamite.
Wanna borrow mine, Grant?
'Cause l'll surely give it to ya.
Buy you a drink?
l didn't know you drank.
You marked the coat as single-breasted,
with a four-inch stand collar?
- (man) As you desired, Mr. Travis.
- Lieutenant Colonel.
And the epaulets are gold bullion?
Should be quite a sight.
Where would you like the uniform sent?
San Antonio de Bexar.
l'll be there defending the Alamo.
Defend against what? The Mexican army
left there with their tail between their legs.
Mr. William... she here.
ln your office, waitin'.
Your wife.
Mr. Bowie!
- Colonel.
- Buck.
Drunken Hottentot.
Two-bit dandy.
(Travis) Well, the choices are
abandonment, adultery,
or cruel and barbarous treatment.
l think abandonment's most accurate.
Any of the choices would be appropriate.
You sure you want to do this?
Well, we-we signed the papers.
l meant Charlie.
l don't intend this harshly, but
he should have a male example in his life.
l've already made arrangements for him
to stay with a fine family while l'm away.
Well, we have a long way to travel.
Your father's becoming a rich man,
and he'll be able to see to your education.
You're makin' a jackass
outta yourself, Sam.
Vindictive sons of bitches.
Texas... wasted on the Texians.
They'll come back.
The Mexicans.
A well-trained army,
against all this handful of amateurs.
Only chance we have
is to fight 'em out in the open.
Forts, they're useless,
useless to us.
What is it about
that damn place, anyway?
What place?
The Alamo.
Every time a sour wind blows through,
everybody runs there and hides inside.
Ain't nothin' but mud.
A caved-in church.
And cannon.
Cannon.
Protects my home, Sam.
You don't have no home,
any more than l have.
(Houston sighs)
lt's a damn shame about your wife, Jim.
Am l still your general?
You know you are.
l want you to return to the Alamo,
fetch the cannon back.
Will you do that for me?
Will you promise that you'll do that for me?
Yeah.
Now, you mind Mr. and Mrs. Ayers.
Don't go causing any fuss.
When l return,
we'll get a home of our own.
l promise.
''One crowded hour of glorious life
is worth an age without a name.''
(oman) Jim Bowie's here!
- (man) Know which one he is?
- Right there.
Welcome to San Antonio, Bowie!
- Welcome home, Jim.
- (oman) Welcome home, Mr. Bowie.
Welcome home, Jim.
(faint voices and music)
(? Spanish music)
(music and voices fade)
(man) You all right, Mr. James?
l have a home.
Sir?
(man) We know you guys
from somewhere?
(man laughs)
(man #2) Whoo, that one's
pretty dandy, that one.
Halt!
- Have the quartermaster secure billeting.
- Yes, sir.
- Where you going, sir?
- l'd like to see what l'm fightin' for.
Dismount!
lt was founded as a mission 1 00 years ago.
The Bexarenos called it the Alamo,
after Alamo de Parras,
a Spanish cavalry unit
that moved in 30 years ago.
As you can see, it is not designed
with military intentions.
She's well armed.
Most cannon of any fort
west of the Mississippi.
l placed our largest, the 1 8-pounder, on
the southwest corner, so it fronts the town.
The north wall is in ruins, so l have
two batteries with five cannon to defend it.
What was the original convento
is now barracks and a makeshift infirmary.
Major Jameson, our engineer,
is emplacing a palisade
between the main gate and the church.
- What was here before?
- Nothing. An indefensible flank.
lt still appears indefensible.
Good riflemen and a 1 2-pounder
should hold it.
The church itself wasn't built till 1 756.
lt has no roof.
Was it destroyed in battle?
The Catholics never quite finished it.
Saints Dominic and Francis.
Francis had two gifts:
prophecy,
and the ability to inspire
passionate devotion.
This fort is the only thing
that stands between Santa Anna's army
and our settlements.
As goes the Alamo...
so goes Texas.
lf the need arises, l recommend you take
my personal quarters on the west wall.
They're isolated,
yet near the primary defenses.
l'm afraid l don't understand, sir.
l have personal matters
to attend to in Mina.
l'm leaving you in command.
l know you fought this posting, Travis.
Forting up is not exactly
a cavalryman's dream.
l'll defend it with my life, sir.
Your biggest task will be keeping
the volunteers and the regulars
from killin' one another out of boredom.
The Mexican army would have to cover
300 miles in the dead of winter
to get here before l return.
(man shouts in Spanish)
(men laughing)
l got one guy around my neck,
l got another guy takin' off half my ear
- with his one good tooth.
- (laughter)
The two that l knocked out are now
wakin' up, realizin' who knocked 'em out.
But l'm fine. l'm fine.
'Cause l know l got my trusty, loyal Ward
right next to me.
So l turn over my shoulder,
and who do l find?
Tortilla lady
and her 1 3-year-old hound dog.
(laughter)
Where were ya?
l hate to tell you this, Jim,
but you were in the wrong.
Exactly. That's when l need you the most.
(laughter)
(Boie coughs)
Oh, God. l love this place.
l love it, too.
Colonel?
You look terrible,
almost yellow right around
the cheeks and forehead.
You a doctor now,
along with everything else?
l've heard rumor that you plan to destroy
the mission and remove the cannon.
- Where'd you hear that?
- Men tend to prattle on when they drink.
Your men tend to drink.
lt would be a great mistake.
l agree.
And any further discussion on this
will be between myself and Colonel Neill.
Colonel Neill left Bexar this morning
on personal business.
lt's my command now.
(chuckling)
Well, my, my, my.
That is a swift rise, Billy.
Might as well break out
those long britches.
Your men exhibit no discipline.
lf matters don't change, it will become
my duty, as colonel of this post...
Lieutenant colonel.
Restrain your men... or l will.
(chuckling)
(branch snaps)
Â¿ Habla inglÃ©s. muchachos?
(man) We got 'em, David.
lt appears to me
that we're all on the same side here.
What you doin' out here?
My name is David Crockett.
Crockett of Tennessee?
Davy Crockett?
He prefers ''David.''
Now, there was this little detail
of a re-election back home.
(crod) Aww!
lt's all right. lt's all right.
- 'Cause you know what l told them folks?
- (man) What'd you tell 'em?
- l said, ''You all can go to hell.''
- (laughter)
- ''l'm goin' to Texas!''
- (crod) Yeah!
- Welcome to Texas, Davy.
- Thank you, sir.
- Put your mark on it, Mr. Crockett?
- (man) Look out. Let me through here.
(Crockett) Absolutely.
''l'm half alligator, half snappin' turtle.''
''l can slide off a rainbow and
jump the Mississippi in a single leap.''
Tell 'em, Davy,
how you can whup your weight in wildcats.
l seen you onstage.
Well, that wasn't me.
Why... Why, sure it was.
No, sir, that was just an actor in a play.
He was performin' a character.
Aw, come on, Davy.
Say the lines.
Davy Crockett, the Lion of the West.
l dare San-tanna to show his face
now you're here.
Well, l understood the fightin' was over.
Ain't it?

(? ''Mockingbird Quick Step'')
(imitating mockingbird call)
(hispering)
(cheers and applause)
Well done.
You don't have the sand to even talk
to two of my men, much less arrest them.
l told you l intended
to restore order.
You've got no command
over my volunteers. None.
l have absolute command.
Break 'em out, boys.
Yeah.
'Cause it's gonna be a cold day in hell
anybody takes orders from a debtor
who leaves his pregnant wife
in the middle of the night.
How about a land swindler
who marries a girl, God rest her soul,
for her father's money?
Whoa, whoa, fellers!
Hey, hey, hey, fellers, now, listen.
Just 'cause we ain't got nobody to fight
don't mean we need to fight one another.
Congressman Crockett has a point.
We should do this democratically.
A vote.
- What about Colonel Crockett leadin' us?
- No, l'm ith you fellers, not above you.
All for the lieutenant colonel,
raise your hand.
Now, come on, men. No repercussions.
All in favor of me commanding.
And all for me?
(softly) All right.
You can command the militia only.
Regulars can't be led by a volunteer.
lt's illegal.
You don't like the outcome,
you change the rule?
ls that it, Buck?
Aw, don't fret about it, Jim.
We all know who's in charge.
You know, l don't know why
we had to tent up outside of town
when there are so many fine houses
with big corn-husk beds just sittin' empty.
Why are they empty?
Apparently some of the folks hereabouts
seem to think the Mexicans is comin' back.
Most of the boys think they wouldn't be
here till late spring if they come at all.
- Figure they know something we don't?
- Mijito. cierre la puerta y ven para acÃ¡.
(bell clanging)
(oman) Tell me what is going on!
(Boie heezes)
We'll never be able to defend the town.
(Travis) Orderly withdrawal
into the Alamo.
- Greys fall in!
- Close up!
Shoulder arms! Forward! Forward!
Orderly withdrawal!
Please proceed to the Alamo in an orderly
manner. Don't run. You're fine.
- (oman) Almeron!
- (man) One, two, one, two.
Almeron!

(Boie coughs)
(man) Let's go, men!
Come on! Follow me!
(shouting)
Come on!
(knocks)
Colonel? l'm sorry to disturb you,
but we got quite a mare's nest out here.
l have to get couriers out
while there's still time.
You and your men
will defend the palisade.
The palisade? You talkin' about
that little old bunch of sticks over there?
You prefer a different assignment?
No, that's the one
l was gonna put in for.
lf you could oversee manning the walls,
it would be a help.
We should have six men to a cannon,
1 8 tubes,
- which works out to...
- 1 08 men.
And we should have a man with a musket
every four feet of wall.
We're gonna need more men.
(military drumbeats)
(men shouting orders in Spanish)
i Viva Santa Anna! i Viva MÃ©xico!
(man shouting orders in Spanish)
To Gonzales, and
to Colonel Fannin at Goliad. Godspeed.
Sir.
Colonel, you should see this.
(men shouting in Spanish in the distance)
(man shouting orders in Spanish
in the distance)
We're gonna need a lot more men.
What is Colonel Bowie doing
on the bridge?
Tryin' to talk us out of the spot we're in.
Fire the 1 8-pounder.
- Sir?
- You heard me.
Fire the cannon.
Prime the gun.
(mouthing)
Fire!
(shouting in Spanish)
Lo siento. Manuel.
l had nothing to do with this.
You out of your mind?
- l'm trying to get us a truce!
- A truce?
lf we broker a cessation, we will do so
from a position of strength, not weakness.
- Goddamn!
- We don't turn belly up and beg.
Otherwise, we have said nothing,
and this conflict means nothing.
Dyin'for nothin' means shit to me.
- Their response?
- Shit! (heezes)
(man) David.
Surrender at discretion... Buck.
Perhaps, Colonel,
they'll only execute the officers.
l think we all just got promoted.
Looky here.
(speaking Spanish)
Within a few days
all of Texas will know our situation.
Tell me, Buck,
in Alabama,
precisely how many is ''a few''?

No. Excelencia.
Ah.
Crockett?
Si. Alteza.
iExcelente!

You know, personally, David,
l'd just as soon take my chances
fightin' out in the open.
Hell, l don't like being hemmed in
any more than you do, but here we sit.
(Boie) Avoid cluster at all times.
Keep your eyes set for crossfire.
Pack plenty of grease wrap balls,
put 'em in your blocks.
You may be a-firin' fast, but not yet.
Load all your muskets and stack 'em,
but don't powder 'em.
Ten minutes in this, they'll be
nothin' but sticks, understand? Oh...
And no more of this, by anybody.
Go to it, boys.
- (coughing)
- Here we go, sir.
Come on, let me help you.
That's right.
- (Boie coughs and heezes)
- Take it in.
(Boie coughs)
lt burns.
- But, sir...
- That's it.
l smell like a skunk's ass.
Jim, what ails you, exactly?
Consumption.
Typhoid. Pneumonia.
One or all.
Exactly.
She's a dandy, all right.
That knife fight you got into,
sand bar over in Natchez...
lt was the one that got you written up.
That all true?
You believe everything you read now?
l didn't read it, l heard it.
And the way l heard it,
he put a sword cane and two shots in you.
l don't remember.
Figure ol' Sam will be
down here pretty soon.
When he gets here,
we'll have a good ol' time.
(coughs)
lt was three shots.
Sword came through my lung
and went through my hand,
and then l cut his heart out.
Those ain't bears out there.
Do you understand that... Davy?
Why in the hell do you suppose
they don't just attack us?
l seen vaqueros spend all day long
just killin' one bull.
(military drumbeats)
(? cavalry march)
You bring a band, you're countin' on
havin' something to celebrate.
Mighty nice of 'em to serenade us like this.
lt's a cavalry march, but l'm told
Santa Anna fancies it for other uses.
He borrowed it from the Spaniards,
the Spaniards from the Moors.
- lt's called ''DegÃ¼ello. ''
- Kinda pretty.
DegÃ¼ello means ''slit throat.''
Now, ain't that pretty.

Notice how you can't really hear it
until it stops?
Until they decide to attack, l suspect
we'll be bombarded on a nightly basis.
Deprive us of sleep.
They want you to
start seeing ghosts everywhere.
Colonel, l became a little heated with you
in front of your men.
lt was ill-advised
and not terribly professional.
Don't worry about it.
Most of my men didn't even understand
the words you were usin'.
lt's important that you and l agree.
For me, though we are poorly supplied,
surrender is not an option.
l submit that we engage and delay
until reinforcements arrive.
(Boie chuckles)
Sometimes, it's just the ay
you say things, Travis, that's all.
l swear to God.
(man) Bring it down! Down! Down! Down!

Down! Down!
To the left. To the left.

Do you notice anything different
about them cannon?
(soldier shouts in Spanish)
They moved 'em closer last night.
This will be the spot.
As our well is dryin',
anytime you find yourselves
not busy with other matters,
l need you to be diggin' a new one here.
Ain't bad enough we got to fetch 'em
the water. Now we got to find it for 'em, too.
David, you said you wanted to see him.
There he is,
the Napoleon of the West.
Which one?
- That's Santa Anna?
- Yeah.
He's quite the peacock, isn't he?

You'll be pickin' that up yourself.
Well, l'll be.
- Cut it to shot and send it back to 'em.
- Yes, sir.
Fire the cannon.
Fire!

(Travis) Fire once from each cannon!
You heard the colonel.
Lieutenant colonel, Colonel.
- You heard the man. Let's give 'em a taste!
- (man) Let's give 'em hell!
(men shouting)
Come on, get up here!
And fire!
Fire!
- Fire!
- Fire!
At this very moment our soldiers are held
in the Alamo against a force of thousands.
They put their hopes in Colonel Fannin.
ho. despite his pedigree.
has proven himself ill-equipped to lead.
much less march. an army.
This is from Colonel Travis.
''l call on you in the name of liberty
to come to our aid with all dispatch.''
''lf this call is neglected,
l am determined to sustain myself
as long as possible
and die like a soldier,
who never forgets what is due
to his own honor and that of his country:
victory or death.''
(Houston) Gentlemen...
l will raise an army.
We will relieve the Alamo.
But only after
we have declared independence
and created a government
that can be legally recognized
by all the nations of the world.
That... is what every besieged man
in the Alamo is fighting for.
(Travis) We have no idea
if any of our couriers made it out.
- You know the land and the language.
- You are asking me to leave my men.
l'm asking you to deliver a message
to Houston and return with a response.
l'm ordering it.
Don't give him too much water.
He's just like me.
He drinks too much, he ain't worth a damn.
l'll bring him back to you, Santiago.
You bring yourself back.
Captain... go with God.
(histles)
(coughs)
Makes a man ponder
the possibilities, don't it?
What happened to your cap?
Crawl away?
No. l only wear it when it's extra cold.
The truth is,
l only started wearing that thing...
because of that feller
in that play they did about me.
(Boie coughs)
People expect things.
Ain't it so.
- Can l ask you something?
- All right.
Now, which was tougher,
jumping the Mississippi
or riding that lightning bolt?
(cannon fires)
Can you catch a cannonball?
lf it was just me,
simple old David from Tennessee,
l might drop over that wall
some night and take my chances.
But that Davy Crockett feller,
they're all watchin' him.
He's been on these walls
every day of his life.
He's burning with fever.
Try to get him to drink
something not whiskey.
Sam, get me some sheets
and cold mud.
l have issued orders for Colonel Fannin
to retreat from Goliad.
John Forbes is mustering more men
throughout South Texas
and bringing them to Gonzales.
l expect 1 500 men
to be there when l arrive.
We will march out,
circumventing Santa Anna's army,
and relieve the Alamo from the west,
withdrawing back to the Colorado
and establishing on a line southeast
from Beason's Crossing to Brazoria.
You will have command
of the regular army.
The militias will have their own command.
No. l will command all or none.
You do your calling, and l shall do mine.
l will lead an army.
You will birth a nation.
Gentlemen, to Texas!
(men) To Texas!

Here they come! Here they come!
Position the cannon!
Muster!

- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Get that first one, right there.
Agh!
Arrgh!

Oh, yeah, Davy. Thatta boy!
Fine shootin', boy.
Muy bien. Muy bien. Muy bien.
(? ''DegÃ¼ello'')
(man) Watch the north wall!
(command in Spanish)
Over there.
What are they working at?
When they come over those walls,
l want you to throw up your hands
and holler,
''Soy negro. No disparo. ''
What's that?
Mexican law said
there ain't no slaves, right?
- Yeah.
- And contract or no, that's what you is.
Now, the Mexicans see your color, you
tell 'em, ''Don't shoot.'' They pass you by.
But Mr. William,
he gonna give me a gun, and l'll...
You clean up their shit, you take care of
their horses, you wash 'em, you feed 'em.
Damn if you ain't gonna die for 'em, too.
(clanging)
(Houston) Where is everybody?
30 men from here in Gonzales
have already left for the Alamo.
Assemble the men that we have.
(Houston) We need more men.
lf they arrive every day,
soon we will have enough.
But for now, we wait.
lf we can't run, we walk.
lf we can't walk, we crawl.
But we gotta go to the aid of those boys.
lt's only right.
General, l'm the man who left Travis there.
l do not enjoy waiting
any more than the next man,
but l will not sacrifice Texas.
These 1 24 men cannot pierce
an army of thousands.
Colonel Fannin is en route from Goliad
with 400 men.
These troops need training.
l suggest that you commence with it.
- What should l tell Travis?
- Nothing. You're staying here.
No. General... Sam.
l gave my word!
Where is everybody?
New line
That's an order.
Dig her deep, boys.
Dig her deep.
(under his breath)
Dig her deep.
Good work, boys.
Always good to have a fall-back position.
About the size of a grave,
ain't it, Cap?
Captain Dickinson...
l'm reassigning you and Private Esparza
to the battery at the rear of the church
so you can be near your families.
And l've arranged for a replacement
for your midnight watch.
Thank you, sir.
Gracias.
Here you go, son.
So, Davy,
in all your lndian fightin',
you ever get into a scrape like this?
l was never in but one real scrape
in my life, feller.
- Yeah, but you was in the Red Stick War.
- Yeah, it's true. l was in that.
l sure was.
l was just about your age when it broke out.
The Creeks boxed up
about 400 or 500 people at Fort Mims
and massacred every one of 'em.
Of course, this was big news around those
parts, so l up and joined the volunteers.
l did a little scoutin', but mostly...
l just fetched in venison for the cookfire,
things of that nature.
Well, we caught up with those redskins
at Tallushatchee,
surrounded the village,
come in from all directions.
Wasn't much of a fight, really.
We just shot 'em down like dogs.
Finally...
what lnjuns was left,
they crowded into this little cabin.
They wanted to surrender.
But this squaw, she loosed an arrow
and killed one of the fellers,
and then we shot her.
And then we set the cabin on fire.
We could hear 'em screamin'
for their gods in there.
We smelled 'em burnin'.
We'd had nary to eat
but parched corn since October.
And the next day,
when we dug through the ashes,
we found some potaters
from the cellar.
They'd been cooked by that grease
that run off them lndians.
And we ate till we nearly burst.
Since then...
you pass the taters,
l'll pass 'em right back.
He's been stabbed three times,
once through the lungs,
shot two or three times.
Cholera, malaria, every two years.
(heezes)
He is already dead.
And this is the place he has been sent.
(hispers a prayer)
(man) We got riders!
(men cheer)
Pull back.
Riders on the way!
Colonel Travis.
Congressman Crockett.
l figure this is just about
every able-bodied man in Gonzales, sir.
Those soldados.
they think they got it all sewed up.
But you avoid the roads, there's this
little sliver you can just ease on through.
And Colonel Fannin is behind you?
He ain't here?
l talked to him three days ago in Goliad.
That son of a bitch said he'd be here.
How many rode with you?
Brung ya 32 good men, sir.
And if it ain't the prettiest bunch
of Texians l ever seen.
Let's hear it for Gonzales, boys!
(cheering and hooping)
Excelencia...
(Santa Anna chuckles)
(? ''DegÃ¼ello'' plays in the distance)
Come on!
Fight!
You're yellow!
(echoes)
We're waitin'!
(echoes)
You look better.
Thank you for tending to me.
And now l want you to leave.
Sam...
You, too.
You giving me my papers, Mr. James?
No. You're my property till l die.
And when l get up off my back,
l'm gonna come fetch ya.
For now l want you both to go.
Santa Anna ain't gonna
make that offer twice.
No. She was my sister.
You loved her.
Her blood was yours.
Your blood is mine.
We're family.
The men need a word from you.
l...
l don't know what to tell them.
My time in Washington,
the fellas in Congress
made a good deal of sport of me.
l learned an awful lot from 'em.
Learned how to dress,
to a certain degree,
what fork to use in polite company,
things like that.
l was never afraid to stretch things a bit.
But l never learned to lie.
These people in here
been through an awful lot.
And l would allow that
they've earned the right to hear the truth.
l have here pieces of paper,
letters from politicians and generals,
but no indication of when,
or if, help will arrive.
Letters not worth the ink
committed to them.
l fear that...
no one is coming.
Texas has been a second chance for me.
l expect that might be true
for many of you as well.
lt has been a chance
not only for land and riches,
but also to be a different man.
l hope a better one.
There have been many ideas
brought forth in the past few months
of what Texas is
and what it should become.
We are not all in agreement.
But l'd like to ask each of you
what it is you value so highly
that you are willing to fight
and possibly die for.
We will call that Texas.
The Mexican army hopes to
lure us into attempting escape.
Almost anything seems better
than remaining in this place, penned up.
lf, however,
we force the enemy to attack,
l believe every one of you
will prove himself worth ten in return.
We will not only show the world
what patriots are made of,
but we will also deal a crippling blow
to the army of Santa Anna.
lf anyone wishes to depart...
under the white flag of surrender,
you may do so now.
You have that right.
But if you wish to stay here,
with me, in the Alamo,
we will sell our lives dearly.
(retches)
Leave it.
The light. l want the light.
What troubles you, Buck?
l spoke to the men earlier about our
situation. You deserve to hear it as well.
l heard, through the door, every word.
My words.
How painful for you.
Good words.
Good words.
We could try to get you out with an escort.
lf you're captured, perhaps, given
your condition, mercy would be extended.
l don't deserve mercy.
l do deserve a drink.
- You got anything stronger than water?
- l don't drink, Jim. You know that.
l gamble, go to whores,
run off on wives.
But drinkin'...
l draw the line.
You know, you live another five years,
you just might be a great man.
l think l will probably have to settle
for what l am now.
Buck...
Did it matter?
l'll see about fetchin' you a bottle.
(? ''DegÃ¼ello'' plays in the distance)
God, l despise that tune.
l just figured it out.
Figured out what?
What it's missin'.
(drums beating)
(plays harmonizing accompaniment)
(silence)
(soldier) Take cover, boys!
Crockett.
lt's amazing what a little harmony'll do.
Well, isn't that something?
(thunder)
Dearest Mary.
I hope someone ith a kind voice
is reading this to you.
If you could see. you'd kno
ho beautiful this land - our home - is.
Kiss all six children for me.
and kiss them again.
(man) The scarcity of paper. together ith
other difficulties I've had to labor under.
has prevented me from riting before this.
and. indeed. it is a matter of claim
hether this letter
ill ever reach the United States.
(man #2)
Please remember me to my father
and tell him to think of nothing but of
coming to this fair country hen it is free.
(man #3) I go the hole hog
in the cause of Texas.
I expect to help them
gain their independence
and to also form their civil government.
for it is orth risking many lives for.
From hat I have seen
and learned from others.
there is not so fair a portion
of the earth's surface armed by the sun.
(Ward) We kno hat aaits us.
and e are prepared to meet it.
(Travis) My respects to all friends.
confusion to all enemies.
God bless you.
Take care of my little boy.

(soldier) They're behind us, boys!
They're behind us!
- Kill as many as you can!
- Kill them! Kill them!
(Susanna screams and sobs)
Get down! Get down.
(groaning)
Micajah.
They've killed me, David. l...
l'm real sorry about all this.
(footsteps approaching)
(yelling)
(Mexican soldiers shouting)
Expliquele.
(translator) Throw yourself
on the mercy of His Excellency,
Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna.
Are you San-tanna?
l thought he'd be taller.
(hispers) Davy Crockett.
You tell the general
that l'm willing to discuss
the terms of surrender.
You tell him,
if he'll tell his men to lay their weapons
down and assemble peacefully,
l promise to take you all
to General Houston,
and l'll try my best
to save most of your lives.
That said, Sam's a might prickly.
So no promises.
Tell him.
Tell him!
Excelencia...
Excelencia!
l wanna warn you all...
l'm a screamer.
Aaarghhh!
(soldier) Burn it all!
(soldier #2) Burn this barn!
(soldier #3) Burn it down.
Don't leave nothin' for the Mexicans.
Move, move, move!
Coronel Morales...
General Gaona...
How far east do we have to run
before we're safe?
You keep retreating, we have to, too.
Gimme one good reason why
we don't just dig in right here and fight.
''Sir, the enemy are laughing you to scorn.''
''You must fight them.
You must retreat no further.''
''The country expects you to fight.''
''The salvation of the country
depends on your doing so.''
''Signed, David G. Burnet, President.''
The man's spineless. How far do we intend
to follow this traitor aay from battle?
lt's time to fight, boys.
(Houston) Break camp.
We continue east.
They massacred our brothers,
and we're runnin'?
They have to pay.
lf not now, you tell me when.
Break camp!
(man) Let's go.
(men shouting)
(Seguin) Sam, if we keep running,
you will lose your army.
20-odd years ago,
Napoleon returns from exile in Elba,
puts together an army
and moves east, swiftly,
before an alliance of nations can occur.
Wellington,
with fewer men, fewer armaments,
stays one step ahead of the French,
teasing them with his presence,
knoing that a large army
ill have to splinter to keep up.
He moves and aits.
moves and aits
for Napoleon to make a mistake.
to fall into a scenario
that condemns him to defeat.
Wellington chooses the setting for victory
before it exists for him,
before he lays eyes on it.
It has an open battleground.
a sloping plain.
cover for encampment.
and an opportunity to flank the enemy.
The Mexican army is splintered,
and though they do not know it,
Santa Anna's troops
subsist on gasps of air and sips of hope.
l share Wellington's battleground vision,
though l do not know
the name of the place that l imagine.
l, sir, do not consider myself Wellington.
Santa Anna, however, does consider
himself to be the Napoleon of the West.
We shall move and wait
until he makes a mistake
and presents us with his own Waterloo.
(distant shouting of orders in Spanish)
Stay back, everybody. Stay back.
(Seguin) Bring him here.
Water!
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.
Water!
Escucha. Escucha.
Deaf captured a Mexican courier.
His letters tell us that Santa Anna's nearby
and separated from the rest of his army.
General...
(faint voices)
Left! Left, march!
Attention!
Back to back. Stay sharp.
(man) Bayonets!
Ready!
March!
March!
Do you have a name?
There is a bridge behind the Mexican line.
Send Deaf Smith and his men to burn it.
Captain Seguin.
You and your men shall guard the camp.
There could be confusion out there.
Men shooting any Mexican they see.
General, you ordered me to stay,
and l stayed.
But this is our fight, too.
You shall join Sherman on the left flank.
(man) Two blades per man!
(man) Company, shoulder arms!
You will remember this battle,
remember each minute of it,
each second,
till the day that you die.
But that is for tomorrow, gentlemen!
For today,
remember the Alamo!
The hour is at hand!
(men cheering)
Form ranks!
Battalion, halt!
Fire!
Fire!
March!
Remember the Alamo!
Forward guns! Fight!
(soldier) Remember the Alamo!
iA la batalla. tejanos!
(man) Dig the plot, boys.
Kill them all!
(all shouting)
- Let's kill him and be done with it.
- (men) Yeah!
l say we hang him from this very tree.
(men) Yeah! Hang him!
(man) Hang him!
No.
You'll settle for blood.
l want Texas.
