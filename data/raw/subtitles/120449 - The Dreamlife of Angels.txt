THE DREAM LIFE OF ANGELS
There's no one.
Sorry to bother you.
I'm looking for Alain Bagnon.
He doesn't live here anymore.
He's gone.
But his truck's outside.
It doesn't work anymore.
He's abandoned it.
He's left for Belgium.
Belgium? Do you know where?
No.
He's working on the building sites.
They change all the time.
He left no address
or keys to the house?
No, he left a month ago.
Why, who are you?
I'm a friend.
I can't tell you any more.
All right, never mind.
Good-bye.
What language is that?
Yugoslav.
I help foreigners.
We make little cards like this...
and make a little money...
to help foreigners coming to France.
Pretty, aren't they? A present
for your kids. You have kids?
Yes, I have a daughter.
Like you, the same hair.
She's gone to the States.
She's working in Boston.
I haven't seen her
for ten years.
She works for the United States.
That's nice. What does she do?
Makes clothes for the Americans.
Lots of clothes.
Clothes for the American army,
uniforms.
For the police?
For the police, too.
All uniforms.
That's not much fun.
- How old are you?
- Me? 21. Why?
- Where are you from?
- A place in the sticks.
Not Boston, that's for sure.
But I get around.
Want to buy a card?
You don't have work?
I'll find you a real job.
You like to work?
You like to work,
I'll get you a real job.
I'll give you the address.
Come tomorrow at 8:00.
What kind of work?
Sewing on a machine.
You know how to sew?
- Sewing with a machine?
- Yes, sewing.
Good job for you.
Here's the address.
Come tomorrow at 8:00.
All right. But it's to sew
with sewing machines?
With a machine.
You know how to sew?
Yes.
Good. Come at 8:00 tomorrow.
We'll try.
Won't you buy a card?
No money?
No, I have nothing.
Never mind. Hello.
Would you like to buy a card?
It's for the elderly.
It's to help children.
That one's nice.
Shit!
Sit up straight!
Gently, watch what you're doing.
- That's no good.
- Of course it's no good.
That's the wrong way round.
Sit up straight.
- Can you sew?
- The machines go a bit fast.
Go on, show me. Straight.
Gently, right up against the plate.
- I'll get the hang of it.
- Don't pull on it.
Break the thread.
Just pull it.
Be careful.
Shit!
Christ!
Where's my saucepan?
- You have to bring lunch?
- No one told you?
What'll you do then?
Can we give her something?
Take a plate.
Take a big one.
- Can I sit here?
- Of course you can.
I've got ham and rice.
I eat cold.
Otherwise I get hot flashes
when I work.
- Enjoy your meal.
- You, too.
Thanks.
- Stretching your legs?
- Yes.
Hello.
Go ahead, I don't mind.
- Are those the toilets?
- No, they don't work.
The ones on the other side work.
At what time does work start again?
At 1:00 you'll hear the machines
start up again.
They're great machines.
I pretended I knew how
to work them, but...
How many do you make a day?
A thousand.
Christ!
How long have you been sewing?
Two weeks.
You'd never sewed before?
No, I'm not a dressmaker.
I'm doing it for the time being.
You learn fast. I don't know
if I'll be able to.
They're sewing machines,
not computers.
Can I have a drag?
What did you do before?
I was working.
What, sewing?
That's right, for Chanel.
No, waitress at The Dukes.
What's The Dukes?
The big hotel in the center.
You didn't like being a waitress?
The boss soon got
on my nerves.
He treated us like shit,
simply because he's the boss.
I slapped him one.
He didn't see it coming.
He was bleeding.
He won't forget me in a hurry.
What had he done to you?
The next day I scratched his car
on both sides.
He was mad.
He got stitches
and a scratched car as well.
I'm only staying here until
I get a little money together.
I don't think
I'm going to stay here...
very long either.
We have to go.
- Bye!
- See you tomorrow!
Can I have an advance?
No money now. Next week!
- But tomorrow...
- Not enough work. Next week.
- But I'll do plenty.
- Next week.
Do you know a cheap place near here?
I need a room.
I don't know.
I don't live here.
I froze my butt off last night.
Can't I stay at your place tonight?
I was counting on a friend. He's away,
and I don't know anyone in Lille.
I don't know.
If you've got nowhere... - 
Thanks. That's kind of you.
It's great!
It looks big.
Can I look around?
You can sleep on the couch.
That's cool.
I'll go to sleep watching the TV.
That's a funny TV.
This flat's huge!
It's great.
- You live here alone?
- Yes.
What are you preparing?
Can I help?
No. Are you hungry?
Help yourself in the fridge.
I'm going out.
I can't spend the evening indoors.
I said I'd never touched a machine.
It's not true.
I was an apprentice for a year
when I was 16, but I didn't stay.
I thought so.
The flat isn't mine.
It belongs to a woman and her daughter
who are in the hospital.
I'm looking after the flat.
- What have they got?
- They were in a car crash.
You've always lived in Lille?
I was born in the suburbs.
And you never moved?
I'm going to make some money
and split!
I don't like the grey and the cold.
It's awful here.
- Concert tickets? Half price.
- Where?
The Plaza. Eighty for one,
160 for two.
Half price, my ass!
We're broke.
- What you got?
- Nothing.
One hundred for two.
Stop waving them in our faces!
We're broke.
We don't want them!
What's the Plaza?
Is it far?
- Let's try to get in.
- How do you expect to get in?
Let's try.
We can always come back.
Hello.
We haven't got any money.
Can you let us in?
If you need money,
get a job, darling.
I know.
But it's halfway through.
Be cool, let us in, will you?
I'll push the barrier.
Put that barrier back!
Put that barrier back.
That's clear enough!
Wait, I'm asking
for permission.
You think I want to fight?
Fredo, it's for you.
- You want to get in?
- Yes.
I'll tell you why
it isn't possible.
The people playing music...
they've worked hard, they've come
a long way, they have to be paid.
We want to see them.
The rental of the hall,
none of it's free.
- Are you paying them?
- No, I'm not paying them.
And there are technicians, too.
Two people, two girls!
Who'll notice in the crowd?
I will! And you're
interrupting me.
Interrupting? We're talking!
What's your problem?
Say yes or no. Anyway, what's it to you?
You're not the boss.
The little brunette can go in.
Not the other one.
What will I do alone?
I'm not going in without her.
Asshole!
- What did you say?
- Let's blow!
Push off!
You want to fight, fatty?
Wake up, Marie.
We're late.
What's that?
- How many have you made?
- I don't know. A lot.
What? Have you seen
what you've done?
How many have you made?
Look at this!
- Shoddy work!
- She's mad!
- We can't use this.
- What's the matter?
We don't need girls like you!
You don't know how to work. Go!
- Tell me what's wrong.
- We can't use this. It's a waste!
Stop it! What's the problem?
Take your jacket and go!
Take your jacket!
Look, she's sewn them inside out.
What is this?
Everything's inside out!
You're occupying a machine
when lots of women are waiting.
What is this?
Stop using the machine.
All right, I'm going.
Go. You're losing us money.
To hell with this job.
I'm not going back.
No, it's work. You have to go.
Have you seen how he treats us?
Shut up and sew!
You can stay at the flat.
- At least we've got that.
- I can?
- Do you have money saved up?
- No, nothing.
When I have no money,
I sell cards. Look.
I make them.
I sell them for
10 or 20 francs.
- To people in the street?
- Yes, you make up any old story.
I'll give you some.
- I don't beg. It's humiliating.
- Why, it isn't humiliating.
- When people refuse?
- You move on.
Look, Fredo, our two little dodgers.
No one told you to sit here!
We sit where there's room.
By the way, which one of you
called me fat last night?
- Fat?
- Fat. I heard the word "fat."
- I don't know. Not us.
- Really? Not you.
- Hi, Fredo.
- Hi, Luis.
What about Manu?
Drop Manu, will you?
Get the message?
What are you doing tonight?
Couldn't we work at your concerts?
Hear that, Fredo?
What would you do?
I don't know.
Look after the singers.
- What do the girls do?
- There aren't any girls.
At concerts, you drink the wine,
load the trucks...
and anything that moves
gets jumped on.
You don't know what you're in for.
- You've never been in the shit?
- Who, me?
You let him jump you
to get this job?
You're lucky you're a chick!
Don't talk like that to Fredo
or he'll do you!
He mustn't talk to Marie
like that.
She's just getting
the wrong message.
I never said I wanted to do you.
Who are you anyway?
Just a bouncer.
You can't get us a job.
All on your own! I'd like to see
in 15 years how you end up!
You think we need you?
Don't bother coming to any concerts.
You're banned.
- The master of the world!
- Calm down.
This is our table. Get lost!
Keep calm, Fredo.
He'll land you one
if you keep insulting him.
I'm not insulting you.
What is this? Enough!
We haven't even introduced ourselves.
- Charlie.
- Marie.
- Charlie.
- Isa.
- Fredo.
- Fredo, he said.
Can I come in?
- I've made breakfast.
- Cool.
Shall I put it here?
- What time is it?
- It's 12:00.
- Shit. Have you eaten?
- No.
Join me, then.
Shall I open the curtains?
I'd been working for a week.
He didn't seem to be
interested in me.
One day when he wasn't expecting it,
I jumped on him.
He was having a nap, and bam!
It was a house I was redoing
down South.
He was living with his mother.
She was great.
She was a painter.
She was doing great stuff.
I ended up almost living
with them.
Then we finished the job.
During the last days, I didn't know
whether to talk to him or not.
Whether he wanted me to stay
or for it to end like that.
We never talked about our feelings.
It wasn't easy.
And then, on the last day,
I packed our gear with the mason.
And I didn't know what to do,
and the fool still said nothing.
So, I said good... bye to him
like to the others.
I walked to the truck...
and at each step
I hoped he'd tell me to stay.
He let me get into the truck...
and that was that.
Later I regretted
not saying anything.
It wasn't up to you.
- You wouldn't have?
- No.
- It was a stupid ending.
- It wasn't your fault.
If he'd wanted,
he'd have asked you to stay.
Maybe he was afraid
I'd invade his life.
Maybe if I'd had my own place
it would have been different.
He slept with you
because you were available.
A girl on the road.
It was practical.
Maybe he was waiting with each step
for me to turn around.
We'll never know.
You're torturing yourself,
and you dream a lot.
Have you got a guy?
- Don't you like the bouncer?
- Are you crazy?
You were in his bed!
I didn't think you'd screw him.
I didn't screw him.
We drank, you went to sleep.
What about Fredo?
He fancies you.
No, thank you!
I don't like him.
He freaks me out. He's weird.
Charlie said they don't only
do the concerts.
They're also bouncers
for this club, The Blue.
He gave me his number,
but I won't call.
I don't get stuck on guys.
They get on my nerves.
You're not answering?
No. It's for them anyway.
Been to see them in the hospital?
I don't know them.
I got the flat through my aunt.
Besides, they're in a coma.
Both of them?
Yes, I think so.
Have you settled in?
Do what I did.
Just move her stuff.
But what if they come back
and I'm here?
We'll see.
We'll say I'm your cousin from Brittany.
You're putting me up.
All right.
I am starting this diary
on a sunny day.
Like a mirror for me
to know who I am.
I feel things inside,
overwhelming things.
I feel my pulse beating.
I'm confused, nervous.
Like something missing,
a desire...
I can't yet control.
On the edge of an abyss,
I feel this crazy urge to jump.
What are you doing,
for Christ's sake?
It isn't a pancake, it's a...
Classy!
It's not a sword fight!
You need practice.
Do you like them?
Yes.
The woman painter
gave them to me.
I didn't expect her to.
Take one.
But they were a gift!
Go ahead. I swear.
I want you to have one.
Choose the one you prefer.
It's yours.
This one.
It's yours.
Thanks.
We'll find you another.
One with a car.
We'll go for a long ride.
Anyway, we'll have a drink.
Let's see.
A guy for you.
He's too old.
Wait, Marie.
He's super sexy.
- There's one!
- He's too good-looking!
Hello. I need to talk to you.
Sorry to bother you, but I have
a message from my friend, Marie.
She's been following you
for several months.
She's shy, but she knows
everything about you.
You're a great guy
and you've got a lot of money...
but she's shy and comes from
a more modest background.
These things happen.
She wants to know if the little detail
of class matters...
or if it's love that counts.
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.
- Marie, she's pretty.
- Pretty name.
Like in a fairy story.
Look at the way he walks!
He's uptight.
Let's follow him.
Come on, run!
Wait, I've got something
to tell you.
Open the window!
We're looking for a chauffeur
for the afternoon.
- Sorry, it's my day off.
- Just a little ride.
I've just cleaned my car.
How old are you?
Got your license?
Hi, Charlie!
Hi, Fredo!
- Stuck outside?
- Did they throw you out?
- Not too cold, is it?
- No, we're used to it. Found work yet?
Still looking.
Got a couple of things lined up.
If you're looking for work...
The Hollywood is looking for girls.
- The what?
- The Hollywood.
Do you know The Hollywood?
A club and a restaurant.
In the shopping center.
Do you know it?
They'll hire us as waitresses?
- Not good enough for you?
- Careful.
Out of the way.
Let us do our job.
- How many?
- Six.
I see!
I get it. You sort out
the good from the bad.
That's right.
- And you'll let us in?
- How much is the admission?
If we let you in, we'll be left
out here on our own.
That's not nice.
If you didn't know me,
would you let me in?
Not like that. She could grow her hair,
you could have yours done...
a little makeup,
you wear a dress...
Try and look like girls.
What a job! You just judge people
by their appearance.
Great!
Not again!
If you want to go in, go in!
In that stuffy joint?
I wouldn't be caught dead!
Here's the boss.
Shit! The guy whose light
I busted!
You're right.
Hi, Fredo. Hi, Charlie.
Everything okay?
Yes, everything's fine.
See you later.
- He's the boss?
- Yes, he's the boss.
Some get an early start!
- He's young.
- That's true.
- What did he do to own this place?
- Easy. He was born into it.
See The Grande Brasserie over there?
His dad owns that.
We're free on Thursday.
Let's hook up.
- We don't know what we're doing.
- You don't know.
- We'll call you.
- Yeah, like last time.
Good... bye, boys. Good night.
Yeah, right, good night.
Walk in the light!
- Is Marie there?
- Yes, she's in.
- I'm her mother.
- Hello.
Come in.
Shall I get her?
Your mum's here.
Why are you here?
I was in Lille.
I tried to call earlier.
You could say hello.
I wanted to see the flat.
As you can see, it's a flat.
It's okay.
Let's go down to the café
across the street.
Wait.
Isa, we're just going for a drink.
I came on my own.
He can't get about easily.
Sure. Let's go.
- Let's have lunch.
- All right.
Rémi, I love you.
Does Rémi know how to say
"I love you"?
Rémi has blue eyes,
white legs, a scrawny neck...
cauliflower ears
and a willie the shape of...
Woke up expecting something
to happen. Nothing.
Excitement.
She'll bring him here
and they'll screw.
She'll say, "Hush!
Sandrine's sleeping. "
What a bummer, my mother
with a guy like that.
If I put a carving knife...
under her mattress, he won't
be able to get an erection.
- I've come to see Sandrine Val.
- Which ward?
I don't know.
She's in a coma.
Neurology then.
Professor Delacour's ward.
Take the lift, second floor, corridor B.
Ask for the nurses' office.
She's unconscious,
she can't communicate.
She can't talk or move.
She won't answer you.
We're watching for any sign
of her waking or of an improvement.
Spend some time with her.
If the sound of your voice
triggers off a sign...
let me or one of the nurses know.
It's very important.
Her mother died a few days
after the accident.
Doctor, please?
Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Hello, Sandrine.
You've eaten well again.
Visits seem to give you
an appetite.
I'II make you comfortable.
There you are.
You'll catch cold like that.
The tips of her fingers
are always cold.
She still has
a slight temperature.
Are you a relative?
One of her friends?
Yes.
Guess what I've just done.
Lent my mother 1,000 francs.
Christ! I'm broke
and I have to give her money!
Because she's married to a jerk!
- Your father?
- Yes.
She says he wants
to see me again.
Has it been a long time?
Four years, since I left.
She seems fine.
She isn't nice, she's a victim.
It's different.
Did you notice?
She never looks you in the eye.
Do you still see your parents?
My mother.
When I can, or I write.
I get on well with her.
What does she do?
She works in a shoe factory
in Valence.
And your father?
They only stayed together
a year.
My father married again
and had other children.
I went to live with them for a while,
but I went back to my mum.
It was cooler with her.
You're lucky
your parents separated.
Mine stayed together.
Maybe in four years
your father's changed.
My father's mad,
that doesn't change.
Now he's really sick
so he's calmed down.
What did you do today?
I visited Sandrine
at the hospital.
Her mother's dead.
She's still in a coma.
They don't know how long
the coma can last.
She could stay like that
and grow old on her bed.
I'll go back and see her.
What for?
She doesn't seem to get any visits.
It might do her good.
What a drag!
If her mother's dead,
we'll get thrown out.
Those of you who've just arrived,
fill in the forms...
and attach your photos.
Think of your favorite star,
Lauren Bacall, Dietrich, Garbo...
If you've already been a waitress,
say where and for how long.
Two on the photo.
How can we tell who's who?
Who's Isabelle Tostin?
There are two on the photo.
I'm Isabelle Tostin.
You worked at The Dukes,
like Marie Thomas. You're Ms. Thomas?
You're inseparable,
like lovebirds.
Does the idea of working at
The Hollywood make you feel like stars?
Yes, absolutely!
Who's your favorite star,
Isabelle?
Madonna.
Madonna, okay.
Could you do something
like Madonna?
Yes.
Like in concert?
Like on TV?
All right.
Or "Like a Virgin."
Okay, very good.
Marie, who's your favorite star?
No one.
I just came with my friend.
You must have a favorite star.
Yes, Marie, Lauren Bacall.
- She doesn't know me well enough.
- You said Lauren Bacall.
Lauren Bacall, go on, Marie.
There you are, Lauren Bacall.
All right.
You aren't very affectionate,
are you?
I am.
Well, you've had me.
You should be glad.
Yes.
Why do you say that?
You've had me, too.
- Well, no.
- What do you mean, no?
I don't want you.
So you make love to a guy
you don't fancy, is that it?
- You just screw around.
- That must be it.
With all of them?
I didn't expect to end up
in your bed.
I didn't expect to end up
with a fat guy.
A fat guy. I don't think
of myself as fat.
It's just a question of vocabulary.
You okay?
What about you, not flattened?
Did you sleep with Fredo?
He fancies you a lot.
Are we going?
On the bikes?
Shit, my scarf.
- What are you doing?
- I've forgotten my scarf.
Hurry up, we'll be late.
Shall I see you tomorrow?
I don't want to go too fast.
Can you say that to my face?
Have you got any money?
I'm fine.
Here.
- He gave me 200 francs.
- Cool!
Coming!
Could you wait outside?
I have to finish this.
I won't be long.
Just outside.
Follow my finger to the left.
Good, you did it well today.
Follow my finger again. Go on.
Go on, continue.
Good. Well done.
Again.
To the left. Follow my finger.
No, don't move.
You can talk to her.
She'd like that.
She's sleeping,
but she can hear you.
January 10
You've been in the hospital...
in a room...
for a month.
Your mother's...
dead.
My name's Isabelle.
I'm 21, I live in your flat.
I have a friend: Marie.
Do you have a receipt for this?
I wouldn't do that!
Look at that.
You'll have to pay.
Do you have any money?
Take if off and follow us.
I know her. I'll pay.
- You're going to pay?
- That's what I said.
- 1,000 francs.
- That much!
I don't want it.
I won't wear it.
- Quiet! You steal clothes!
- Where do I pay, please?
Follow me, sir.
You aren't the grateful type.
I have no money.
I can't pay you back.
What do you do
when you aren't shoplifting?
I work.
Really? What do you do?
It depends.
- Do you live alone?
- What do you mean?
- Do you have a fiancé?
- That's none of your business.
I've got a club
on Carnot Square.
The Blue.
Do you know where it is?
Carnot Square.
I'd like to see you again.
I'm not interested.
You can find me at The Blue
or at the Grande Brasserie.
Drop by tomorrow afternoon.
I'II buy you a drink.
I said no.
Pity.
This is the last time
you'll see me.
Who do you think you are?
You don't get it.
I'll explain.
Are you crazy?
It was just to see.
Now you know.
Christ!
- I could do the same thing.
- Just you try it!
I'll take you home.
Where do you live?
That's worth 1,000 francs.
- You're forgetting something.
- I don't want it.
Never mind.
It'll be fine for someone
on my staff.
Have a look around,
then we're quits.
Isa...
I don't know his name.
Go ahead, look around.
That's the bedroom.
It's private.
He's got a cheek!
What's he doing here?
I met him in a bar.
He wanted to see the flat.
- He didn't mention the light?
- No.
- He didn't recognize you?
- I don't know.
How do you like it?
You expected a dump?
There's a bathroom
and a kitchen, too.
I've made a chicken curry.
Does he want to eat with us?
I prefer a restaurant.
I'II treat you.
You've got money to spend!
I'm not leaving my friend alone.
Never mind.
If you change your mind,
drop by The Blue or The Brasserie.
Didn't they teach you
to close doors?
Spoiled rich kid!
Asshole!
We're going on tour
for two weeks.
- When?
- This coming Thursday.
- Can't we come with you?
- No, we can't bring anyone.
But when I get back,
I might have work for you.
- On the concerts?
- Yes.
In the meantime.
Thanks.
Half of it's for Isa
from Fredo.
- He doesn't dare tell her.
- She doesn't fancy him.
That's their problem.
Let them sort it out.
January 4.
First visit to Sandrine.
What are you doing?
Nothing. Just drawing.
I'm fed up. Let's go out.
No, we're fine here.
I'll be with you in a moment.
Come to see what my place is like?
It's your turn now.
Yes, I'm looking around.
Like it?
It's all right.
It's just a bar.
I have to go.
I've got something to do.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
Come with me.
Where?
In town.
For a walk.
Coming?
I'd like a room, please.
Just for one night?
Room 302.
We'll take you to your room.
Jean-Luc!
Hello, sir.
Miss.
Come on, this is becoming
embarrassing.
Come on.
"The grass smelled of damp wood...
because it often rained.
Very old, tall trees.
The sound of the river
hidden beneath the brambles.
The black crows...
their yellow beaks.
The fresh air stinging
our cheeks.
February 18.
Sunshine at last.
School excursion to Honfleur.
We left all together.
I felt completely with the others.
At one with them.
I was Lau, I was Marc,
I was Rémi.
Maybe it was the strong wind
on the beach which mixed us.
In the coach,
I sat next to Rémi.
I fell asleep...
and when I woke up,
my head was leaning on his shoulder.
He was asleep, too."
Christ, you scared me!
What are you doing in the dark?
Nothing. I just got home.
What time is it?
11:00.
Charlie called.
He'll call back.
Their tour seems to be going well.
What did you do?
Nothing. I just hung around.
I'm dead beat.
I'm going to bed.
I wonder if she can hear.
You know, when you speak,
if she understands.
Yesterday I tried something.
She has a diary.
I found it in her desk.
I read it to her.
Maybe she can hear?
What came over you?
She gave you permission
to go through her things?
She's completely unconscious.
She hears a strange voice
tell her story!
She'll think she's hearing voices.
I don't believe it!
She must have been petrified!
What did you do?
Sit down next to her,
open her diary and read it?
You thought she'd answer,
give a sign?
No, but...
I don't know.
What? The Hollywood?
Hello.
Really? Why?
We aren't hired? Why?
Marie Thomas, yes, she's here.
Hold on.
It's to hand out fliers
on roller skates.
Roller skates?
Yes, we're interested.
I'll take down the address.
On roller skates is fine!
Okay, no problem.
Good-bye.
It's not bad.
Why didn't they take us on
as waitresses?
- I'm Isabelle Tostin.
- Isabelle Tostin, okay.
I have two outfits.
You're the other one?
No, I'm just accompanying my friend.
Isabelle, put this jacket on.
The skirt, this under it.
The skates.
Some warm tights...
and a cap.
Go and change behind the car, please.
I've got two skates
for the same foot.
- In the car?
- No, outside, behind it will do.
- Is that okay?
- You look like a turkey.
Very funny.
Ready, Isabelle?
I'd like to explain to everyone.
- I have to lace up the skates.
- Do it here.
Don't forget, it's free for girls
on Fridays and Saturdays.
Isabelle and Soléne, you do the station
and the shopping center.
Back here at 12:00.
I'll give you some more fliers.
Don't put any in letter boxes!
I'd like to talk to Chris, please.
This is Marie.
Do you know when he'll be back?
All right, I'II call back.
We were at the bottom
of this huge slope.
This guy on a scooter goes by...
and says, "Hang on to me."
So I hang on and put out my hand
for Soléne to hang on...
But you were already far.
No, I wasn't.
You were too slow.
- But I don't know how to skate.
- Good... looking pizza boy.
I didn't get a chance to see him.
You should have been there, Marie.
Want to sleep here?
I don't know.
If it's no trouble.
- It's a long way home at this hour.
- Can I use the phone?
It must be in the living room.
Are you angry?
It's just that someone like that...
Why did you bring her here?
But she's nice.
Nice! She's wet!
It's to help her out.
- What about the sandwich boards?
- Shit, the boards!
I'll be able to go out
in the evenings.
I want to make the most of it.
That's great.
How did you get the job?
Caroline's father, the agency.
I think he likes me,
that's why he took me on.
We won't see each other.
I'II be back for two or three days
between trips.
Where are you going?
Martinique...
then Senegal, I think.
You'll send me a postcard?
Where to, here or your place?
What is it? Wait.
You okay?
Yes.
Who are your friends?
Want to meet them?
Coming to Marc's?
I don't know.
They can do without you
for an afternoon. Come on.
Stay if you want to chat her up.
Sometimes you're not too choosy.
What did you say?
Not too choosy.
Now, if you take it personally...
- Are you talking to me?
- Not to you, I don't know you.
She's crazy! Who's this bitch?
Calm down. Go to Marc's.
Right, go to Marc's!
You're completely crazy!
What's your problem?
What's the matter?
I'm screwing you.
You want me to screw you?
Gently.
Are we going to see Charlie's guy?
It's been two days.
Shall we go this afternoon?
I don't know, I'm not free.
You go if you want.
- It looks like a good job.
- Great.
Plenty of sunshine and great pay.
- How are you going to eat?
- I'II go hungry!
What's the matter?
Nothing. Mind your own business.
Get off my back!
Don't talk to me like that!
Calm down. What's the matter?
I can see something's wrong.
Talk. You've been moping indoors
all week.
Do you want to be alone?
Say it.
At least that's clear.
I'm going to see about the job.
I screwed that guy. Chris.
Twice.
He came to see you?
No, I did.
I don't know why. I'm stupid.
You just fancy him.
He's an asshole!
I don't want to see him anymore.
Anyway, he hasn't called.
You know, guys like him... - 
He owns a club.
You're probably not the only one.
Did he say he wanted
to see you again?
Let's go out.
We'll go and see about the job.
You don't care, you've had him!
You've been with the guy from The Blue!
There they are!
How are you?
Hi!
- Cool.
- Great!
Great weather, a great ride!
We're kissing now, are we?
What are you doing?
We're going back to the barge.
Coming?
Yes. Marie, shall we go to the barge?
Come on.
Don't look so pleased!
Come on.
I have to work.
I'm not into screwing in a hotel.
All right?
Better than yesterday.
I had to clear up on my own.
You could have said you were leaving!
Charlie called.
I said you were tired.
You have to call him today.
What are you doing?
I thought he was an asshole!
Not now!
- He doesn't care about us.
- What do you know?
And Charlie?
So what? I do what I like.
He suspects something.
Why, have you told him?
I don't want him
to know who it is.
What about Fredo?
Have you told him where you stand?
That you won't go to bed with him?
- Yes.
- Really?
So, why do you take his money?
He's a poor sap, is he?
A fool?
What's your problem?
Is it his contempt rubbing off?
Hasn't taken long, has it?
Hi.
- Is there any coffee?
- It's there.
- Can I have some...
- Sugar?
Yes, and a spoon.
Does my presence bother her?
No.
Well, yes, but it doesn't matter.
What are you doing at the weekend?
Nothing.
We've got a house by the sea.
I'll take you there.
Have you got any cigarettes?
We've run out.
Yes, I've got some.
Keep them.
I'm going to see the T-shirt guy.
Are you working on Saturday?
I won't be here on Saturday,
nor on Sunday.
Where are you going?
Somewhere.
Don't forget to call Charlie.
She's opened her eyes.
She has? Are you sure?
That's good, it's a first sign.
But it's a little sign.
It doesn't necessarily mean anything.
We have to look out for other signs.
The doctor will be here this afternoon.
Will you be here?
I'll tell him to stop by
so you can talk about it.
There's someone else?
Yes.
It's the real thing?
I don't know him well enough.
What does that mean,
"the real thing"?
He makes your heart beat faster.
When that happens,
you mustn't miss your chance.
Marie, what are you doing?
Stop it.
Leave me alone!
Think! What will you say to him?
Open the door!
- In the street you were crazy.
- I don't care!
Mind your own business!
Open the door.
Don't humiliate yourself.
You're not his dog!
I don't mind.
I've been humiliated before.
A shitty life, treated like shit!
You go around with boards
with shit written on them.
Get him out of your head.
Stop it!
Out of my head, that's what you want?
Hurts, doesn't it?
I don't believe it!
Are you crazy?
This guy's everything?
Can't you think of anything else?
Go ahead, just try!
This girl's almost dead, you're lucky
to be alive and you run after a jerk.
So, what can we do?
Let's call Charlie and Fredo.
Let's go and see them.
You poor sap!
Go ahead and suffer!
- Get lost!
- Go and get hurt!
You're a pain!
Can I go in?
- Are you looking for Charlie?
- No.
You want to go in? Go in.
I don't know.
He's coming.
Can you leave us alone?
You don't look too happy.
No, I'm fine.
It's Marie, she's with this guy.
He's taking her for a fool.
He's driving her mad.
She doesn't realize.
For him, she's just another girl.
She doesn't realize it.
- Who is this guy?
- A guy, you don't know him.
I don't care about him,
he's a jerk.
What is it then?
Well, it's...
It's her.
The way she is,
the way she talks to me.
How does she talk to you?
It's as though she was ashamed of me.
Talk to her about it.
I have. That's all I ever do,
but she won't listen to me!
I've tried talking to her.
- Won't you talk to her?
- To Marie?
No, it's over.
It's already over.
You've forgotten her.
No, not "already."
She's going to be on my mind...
for a long time, you see.
But I'll forget Marie.
What I have to do
is get her out of my thoughts.
You're thinking of yourself.
Can't you help her?
No, I don't want to do that.
She wouldn't listen to me
more than you.
In fact, you don't love her.
You didn't love her.
She was right to leave you.
That's not it.
I don't get it, is that it?
Right, you don't get it.
I don't understand,
I'm a fool.
Hello.
I'm Mrs. Val's brother.
You're looking after the flat?
Well?
- It's not bad, is it?
- Yes, it looks fine.
Come in, come in.
Without the furniture,
a little paint...
No, it looks fine.
- How many rooms are there?
- One living room, two bedrooms.
Have a look around.
The flat has to be empty
by the end of the month, we're selling.
And Sandrine?
Sandrine, you know...
in her state...
she'll never come back to live here.
Will you be in on Tuesday afternoon?
Yes, certainly.
Can you let a workman in,
to evaluate the work needed?
Well?
10,000 francs per square metre.
Say 650,000.
Like it?
They're selling the flat, we have
to leave by the end of the month.
You can go and stay
with Charlie and Fredo.
I might be working at The Blue
as a waitress first, then a barmaid.
They're selling the flat,
we're out at the end of the month.
Are you coming?
- She isn't in.
- I know.
I'm going to leave her.
I want you to tell her.
It's not for me to tell her.
You're her friend.
What should I tell her?
It isn't her fault.
She's a nice girl, but...
it's over, I'm stopping.
Why did you go out with her?
You're an asshole!
Don't count on me.
Is Chris in, please?
Please tell him Marie called.
Can he call me back? He has my number.
Thank you, good-bye.
I only went out for cigarettes!
Are you paranoid?
How can I know where you're going?
Shut the door!
- Any calls?
- No calls.
- I've cooked something.
- I'm not hungry.
We're becoming awful to each other.
I never wanted that.
I have to tell you...
- Put that cigarette back!
- You're crazy.
Put it back in the packet.
I don't go to the tobacconist's
just for you!
Keep them, you poor fool!
I'd like to see you when you realize
you need other people.
I'II send you a photo.
You're living in her flat
and you don't even know her.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
You disgust me.
I think we should each go
our own way.
I'm leaving.
Right, go ahead.
You think you're perfect?
You're just a hanger-on.
What can you do by yourself?
Sell cards!
That'll get you far!
You're screwed up
and you don't realize it.
I've found someone
and I'm happy.
That's what you can't take.
You think Chris
is going to help you?
He doesn't want to see you.
- You know what he's thinking?
- I saw him, he told me.
- What did he say?
- He said it was all over.
When did you see him?
- Three days ago.
- He came to see you?
He came to see me
because he doesn't dare talk to you.
Call him if you don't believe me!
Why didn't you tell me before?
I didn't because I couldn't!
You'd better be telling the truth!
I am, you just won't listen.
You went to see him.
Stuck your nose in my business.
- What did you tell him?
- You're crazy. You've got to calm down.
It's impossible. He didn't say that!
You don't know
what's going on between us!
Go to that dead girl!
That's all you care about, dead bodies!
- Don't you dare say that!
- I'll kill you!
It's over between us!
Shit!
Excuse me, where's Sandrine Val?
She's going to intensive care.
She has a respiration infection.
Is it serious?
Yes, either she recovers quickly...
or we'll lose her.
She's next door.
You can go and see her.
Visits won't be allowed later.
You'll have to call for news.
In that room.
I'm staying.
20fh February.
It's good you've come.
Sandrine's much better.
She's out of danger,
she's showing signs of communicating.
You can talk to her,
she'll hear you.
A familiar face will help her
get her bearings.
You can go to her,
she's in room 225.
I don't want to wake you up.
Sandrine is getting better,
she's going to live.
I hope you find the kind of life
you're looking for...
the one you dream of.
Each day, each second.
Your friend, Isa.
There are different colors
for each contact...
and a connector with holes
numbered 1 to 78.
You have to plug the contacts
into the connector...
matching the colors...
with the numbers on this list.
Go ahead, I'II watch.
You must have done this all your life!
Continue.
