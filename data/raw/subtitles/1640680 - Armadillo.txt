Dear hussars and ISAF Team 7.
This is it.
ls the task important?
Is it still relevant for us Danes?
These are obvious questions
that you may be asking you elves.
Your predecessors
in Helmand have pushed forward -
and made a huge effort
in aid of a civilian population -
that has lived
under miserable conditions.
For this, several of our colleagues
have paid a high price.
lt's your duty to continue
unhesitatingly in their footsteps -
now that your government has
charted its political course.
Yes.
- When are you going to Jutland?
To Jutland?
That will be on... Thursday.
And the exercise will last for...?
- Ten days.
That's it, l think.
lt hasn't really dawned upon me
that you're actually going.
lt doesn't strike you
until the goodbyes.
l've spent months trying to figure it
out, and l gave up. l just don't get it.
You could say it's like football.
You learn so and so much
through practice -
but you learn more
by playing matches.
You also enjoy the comradeship.
- Of course. That's part of it.
It's a challenge and an adventure...
- And that's what hurts!
An adventure? l can't...
- But l want the experience.
What's up?
Did you get home, or what?
No...
l'm here now.
Thanks for calling.
Bye.
What a trendy hairstyle, Kim!
Not bad at all.
Is that our own logo?
- No. It says ''Spearhead.''
The Asian guy with the T-shirt...
He's the medic in my group.
- Okay?
What does he do?
- Patches us up, if necessary.
Does he go on patrol with you?
- Oh, l see. Yes, he does.
l think l'll head upstairs.
- Okay.
See you, Mom.
Goodbye.
- Behave yourself.
l want you to make sure -
that you pay attention
to your surroundings.
Even if you think
it's safe and sound.
Forget about yourself
and what you look like.
l'm going to miss you.
- l'll miss you, too.
l love you.
- l know.
See you.
- Take care.
See you.
Bye, Dad.
See you.
- l'll hold you to that, Mad's.
Promise?
- l promise.
Welcome. Welcome.
Did you have a good trip?
- It was a bit long.
We haven't been bored
in Armadillo.
400 shells were fired yesterday.
It was fairly...
- 400?
A Taliban mortar fired on us,
and we sent off 260 120 mm -
and 120 105 mm.
Air support and Apaches
were called in. It wasn't boring.
The Taliban are much more
on their toes than l had thought.
They are just 800 m away
from Armadillo and on the ball.
So we'll confront them fairly soon.
- It's good there's work for us.
You can count on some action.
l promise it'll be interesting.
Six months without women.
You're awfully cheerful.
- After a long night.
You have M&Ms?
- Hands of. It's my dinner.
Your dinner?
- What's your problem?
Mini wears size 3 in jackets.
ls that why his helmet says
''King of the Green Zone''?
Welcome. Grab some water.
l have a few pointers.
Gun line is shooting.
That's why it's so noisy.
lf you hear what sounds like a
rocket, it's the launchers firing.
lt's fired at anytime of the day.
There was one. That's normal.
Here are the shower containers.
That's the Green Zone.
Observe as much as possible.
When there's combat,
you're obviously more exposed -
so don't just stand there staring.
''Walk-ins'' stop just over there
and call for an interpreter.
lt doesn't take long to figure out
if they're decking around -
or if it's something useful.
You had some questions.
- Yes.
How far north
from Armadillo can we go -
before the Taliban get active?
About 800-1000 m
north of Armadillo.
From up here we can draw a line
almost up to the Helmand River.
This area here is basically ours.
His objective is to move south
and isolate us so we can't get out -
and to diminish our influence on
the locals. That's what he wants to do.
Our patrolling forces him to meet us
here and fight in this narrow pass.
These people are former mujahedeen
and used to fight the Russians -
in the exact same area, so they're
used to fighting a superior force.
They're not afraid.
Ten men might attack form.
Being outnumbered doesn't
stop them. Not at all.
They've got big balls
- That's for sure.
Did you treat the ones who were killed
and wounded in December?
Unfortunately me and J were the ones
who found the dead on 12.19.
We were first on the spot. l grabbed
a detector and started sweeping.
As we went around the vehicle, the
fucking beam from my headlamp -
caught this guy right in his face.
He was staring, but dead, of course.
l closed his eyes
and covered up his face.
And the last guy...
There wasn't much left of him.
l collected body parts for six hours.
Everything.
Fingers, a hand in a glove,
a knee joint, a heart lying around...
lt's hard to describe what
it looks like in a place like that.
You also have to
keep an eye on yourself.
You're not wacko, just because
you laugh at some irrelevant stuff.
You need normally, 'cause this is so
meaningless that you can't grasp it.
Susanne speaking.
- Hi, it's Mad's.
Hi, Mad's.
l was hoping it was you.
How are you?
- Fine. How about you?
That's much more interesting.
l'm fine. We're in Armadillo.
- Okay.
What's Dad up to?
- He sitting right here.
l'll let you talk to him.
Hi, Mad's.
- Hi, Dad. How are you?
We're fine, Mad's.
But yesterday
your mother had a fright -
when the phone rang
in the middle of the night.
l didn't hear it, but she did.
It scared the daylights out of her.
Your first thought is that
something terrible has happened.
But it was a business call from India
about something they're printing -
and they forgot
about the time difference.
Since we left Denmark,
the enemy's objective hasn't changed.
The Taliban's objective is
to destabilize security in Helmand -
and undermine the locals' trust
in the ISAF forces.
lt's important to get
into Haft ran and Astrakhan -
to establish contact with the people.
When you eat your field rations -
and there's something
you don't like -
l suggest you save it
and bring it on patrol.
Give it to the children
as a sign of goodwill.
Rules of engagement.
Remember that self defense
can apply prior to being fired upon.
Such as by confirmed weapons or
people moving into a position to fire.
Yes. Go get ready.
Listen up. Line up, so 6-5 can take
our picture before our first patrol.
l don't have anything.
l can see why the wad is
are dangerous.
They can easily hide an IED.
The thought is sickening.
We're most likely to go around it -
so it would be stupid
to put one here.
905, l saw a man run through
the fence on the eastern side -
of the row of bushes
that run from north to south.
Welcome to Nam.
Hey, interpreter!
- Follow me. Come.
Ayatollah, hurry.
Don't let them onto the poppy field.
This way. Not in the field.
l will show you.
9-0 here. Civilians are showing us
the route around the field.
Salaam Aleichem.
How are you? Alright?
Read your book.
- Are you reading? Yes.
It's a madras.
- Are you studying the Koran?
Have things been calm?
- How is the situation in the area?
Calm?
- No, where is it safe?
Are the Taliban in the area?
- They've taken the whole area.
How could you not know?
They're everywhere.
Tell us if you see anything.
So we can get them out
of the area.
We cannot cooperate with you.
You come with all your weapons,
and then you leave.
We're staying here, and then the
Taliban will come after us.
But if you don't cooperate,
we cannot secure the area -
and then we can't build
a school for your kids.
You have guns, they have guns.
If l talk, they'll cut my throat.
First patrol reporting!
- Look at my back!
Look cool, man!
Just a sec.
First patrol reporting.
lt didn't feel like anything.
Not really.
l probably will,
when we get into the shooting.
But this is also part of it.
It's not all fighting.
Right, we're also here
to help these poor people.
lt's like going to the fun fair
without tying the rollercoaster.
Alright, let's start the debriefing.
The patrol itself. How did it go?
individual skills really sucked.
Seriously.
How many fell to their knees
on short stops?
So, eight men out of 50.
Do we agree that
this has to be improved?
Get into the habit now.
Get your fat ass down on its knees -
because at some point
if you don't, then paw!
So kneel, damn it!
Right. Anything else?
l think l ought to say what l got out
of this patrol. And it wasn't a lot.
Remember this is an agricultural area.
The peasants have just sown their
wheat. And we're sloughing it down.
l could only say that our security out
there was to trample their fields down.
Nothing's happening out there yet.
The good old classic. The coolest
thing about porn is the stay line.
l'd like doctors like that,
if l go to hospital.
Strangely enough it helped him!
lt's weird, don't you think?
You volunteer to sleep on a tiny cot -
and eat crap food for six months.
l know there's more to it.
- l'm doing it for the team spirit.
Team spirit and adventure.
- Yeah.
How do your parents feel about it?
- They're not overjoyed.
My parents were like:
''Don't go on missions.'' -
So l decided to go to Kosovo,
and on my first day at the garrison -
l still thought
l was going to Kosovo.
But at the meeting we were told
that Kosovo wasn't an option.
Here it's all 'Afghan'.
l called my mother afterwards -
and told her l was going
to Afghanistan after all.
She cried her eyes out.
Fucking hell, Erasmus.
What time is it?
41 minutes past.
- What's this? A little mullah?
Are those animals? Two foxes?
- They sure aren't hedgehogs.
What the hell was that?
Was that mortars?
- Call in and find out.
You know what's going on?
Over.
l have a good idea.
l'll just check it out.
lt's probably the person digging
from before that we engaged. Over.
lt's cool they bombed the idiot.
Too bad we can't see him.
You'll be an easy target now.
It's doing a race.
- Nice.
lt's our eyes out there.
lt's cool that it can check out
suspicious things in a compound.
Right.
l'd like to see some action now.
l don't know
what my first reaction will be.
We haven't got a chance to know what
it's like, when we haven't tried it.
And the thought of these
'foreign fighters', you know.
l can imagine that the first contact
will be rather spicy.
He could be Taliban.
Just like anyone
of the l billion people out there.
Too bad we can't tell them apart.
- The only difference is the weapon.
He could be hiding it
under his clothes.
But it's clever.
Imagine we could do the same.
Do you think anyone
is watching us?
Someone's always watching us.
- Right.
There's bound to be someone
in these compounds -
who is on the Taliban side
and keeps an eye on us.
What are you seeing?
What does he want?
What now, Billy Bob?
Hang on a sec.
Who?
- This guy.
Is it the informer?
- No, he's lighting a cigarette.
They don't always do that.
There's been an uproar on the net
about the 40 Pakistanis -
who are said to be entrenched -
but their presence hasn't been
verified. It could be a spook or real.
We're going on a domination patrol -
which is a matter of preventing him
from moving 1reely -
and denying him the upper hand
or being master of the domain.
We've got your back.
Any updates? Over.
- Enemy forces have been sent out.
Roger that.
Who are you?
British? Canadian?
Danish.
- Danish?
Are you Jewish or Christian?
- Jewish?
No.
We're Christian.
Why are you here?
Look what you've done to our soil.
Look!
You shot it up.
You killed our cow.
And you've wounded our family.
- Why did you do that?
The Taliban are way over there.
- They have lots of big weapons.
And they'll shoot you.
903 Victor, October-fest Carlsberg.
Over.
Roger. When the civilians are gone,
they'll open fire. Correct?
Get down!
l have impact.
Scan the area!
Did you see where it came from?
- Signaler, let's go.
What was that?
90, any report on that smoke?
Was it incoming?
What did you say?
- The Taliban are ready to attack.
It's jammed.
- Shit.
Cover us, so 6 can get up here.
- This crap isn't working.
Hurry, Mini.
Allah Akbar.
- Signaler, into the water.
They're behind the two compounds
in a hollow.
Two shooters.
- Knag, ready to go over the top?
Between the two compounds
in the hollow. Ready?
Over there! Can you see them?
- No.
They're in the hollow.
- Yes.
Between the two compounds.
Red smoke. 500 m.
Get ready to fire the recoilless gun.
- Firing!
Reload, reload...!
Everybody out!
Way to go!
Super.
- Well done.
lt's a nice big hole.
What do you think, guys?
- That's what l call a gun slit.
We can see the whole terrain.
He was near the ditch.
The Taliban are ready to fire.
- Careful! Stay down!
The Taliban have reported
they can see five of us.
Signaler, let's move away.
- l'm coming.
Hit the deck!
5, get down!
- Hey! Isn't it over?
No! Get down!
Whisky reports, ''Get down.''
The people standing could get shot.
- Whisky sees ninjas everywhere.
Yes, the guy's a bundle of nerves.
Did you see those guys running?
Where...?
l've got them.
lt's just some kids.
2-5.
Roger. Out.
That was an annoying message.
The locals asked the Taliban
not to shoot -
so they can evacuate the wounded
women and children. Not good.
That's gross.
- Is that a wounded or a dead person?
lf they really are cowards,
they might be carrying weapons out.
The thought did cross my mind.
- It's a good excuse to stare at us.
And they can move weapons to a new
position, when we're on our way back.
Maybe it's just a civilian casualty.
That guy's got balls.
- l hate those damn Taliban.
You can't tell who's who, and the
dicks shoot from civilian compounds.
There's not much we can do.
- No, but it's messy.
What's up, Signaler?
- Well done. Your baptism of fire.
It was a good start for beginners.
- l was about to say that.
It was a good start for beginners.
- Everybody out, everybody home.
Mini?
How much 12.7 ammo did you fire?
A lot.
- You're damn right.
This is a bit heavy.
When l got into the barn,
the chickens attacked me.
When is the bread done?
Why do we have to do this shit?
Ranger.
Look at this, Mad's.
Even if you have a gun,
l'd still win.
It depends on how far away you are.
- Here.
Let's see who draws first.
You have to release yours,
l just have to swing this.
From down there?
Can l Cary it...?
- No. Then l'd be like this.
Kim, you can lift it with one hand,
right? Or do you need two hands?
Ready?
- Gotcha.
Three shots to the chest.
Quite cool...
- It doesn't get much better than that.
See you later, Mad's.
- Send my regards.
Alright, Mad's?
l'll close off those streets.
- Fine.
Mini, over there with Kim.
Why are you with them?
- He's American.
Why are you with them?
- He's red, too.
Get out of the military. Leave.
Leave?
- Yes. Go home.
Do you have a home?
l don't owe you any money,
if that's what you're saying.
He has funny eyes.
He is slant-eyed.
They look pum.
He took it in the ass.
l regret your losses,
but you all know -
that we have to walk in the fields.
How should we know?
Is it our fault, maybe?
Last year they bombarded our house.
l swear by God l don't even
have any clothes to wear.
And my sons cannot help me.
Then we must leave our villages.
What can we do?
What can we do? It's not you
or the Taliban that gets killed.
We are the ones who get killed.
The civilians get killed.
We sit in our homes and get bombed.
The Taliban shoot, and then
they run away. They escape.
We're sory, but we try
to move the war up north.
That would be good for us,
for this ruins everything.
You can't.
People fight, because they're poor.
Including the Taliban.
Come on, you faggots.
- Look who's talking.
You planted bombs, you ape!
So far we know that a civilian car
approached the gas station -
on Highway 1 towards the desert,
the route we usually take home.
The car hit something
and detonated.
There was an explosion.
Our formation is vehicle 1 in front..
Primarily observe
from the rifleman's position.
We'll see how bad it is
when we get there. Okay?
Flip your night vision down
and keep a lookout behind.
On our way back from there
l heard a huge explosion.
l couldn't believe it.
l ran back down -
and 7-5 and 3-5 ran right into me,
so l went flying.
Everybody was running
all over the place.
Then l heard, ''There's
blood everywhere. 2-5 is down.''
l said, ''For fuck's sake, 5.
You should keep your head down.''
Then he said, ''l know.
How about a dance?'' l cracked up.
''This isn't a good time.''
Then l gave him emotional first aid.
He had a huge gash here.
Turned out to be a fractured skull.
Damn.
No fucking fun.
- l'll say.
l heard a massive boom,
and evemhing was sand and dust -
for a few seconds.
l tried to feel if my teeth were broken
with my tongue -
and l tried to wiggle my fingers.
l couldn't tell if my teeth were okay -
because l had so much gravel,
sand and blood in my mouth.
l only felt splinters and stones.
l didn't know what was what.
l tried...
l don't remember clearly -
but l looked down
and saw two trickles of blood.
lt wasn't until l was
in the helicopter -
that l started to get
really uncomfortable.
That's when l had time
to think about it.
''What do l look like now?
Will l ever recover?''
''Will l talk funny for the rest
of my life?'' All those questions.
l have to go back to Armadillo
and stand in front of them all -
and say, ''You can't
get rid of me that easily.''
2-5 here.
- Raven has something.
Three men are walking south.
62.7, 31.4.
Can Alpha 1-7 see them running?
Get the coordinates.
They're splitting up.
- 64.5, 32.0.
Aim at the place
that's been used as a firing point.
Do they have to assemble
the gun first or what?
9-0. Pancake.
Alright!
- About bloody time.
Do you want everyone to meet up?
- Yes...
2end platoon, at the vehicles.
There he is! Our man.
Alright?
- You bet. l'm in great shape.
Hi, guys.
- You smell good, too.
But you don't.
- Hello!
Nice to see you.
- Hey, man.
l'm sick of hugging sweaty guys by
now. Who else? Jesus Christ.
Hey, guys.
Are we all here?
Hey, man.
l'm glad you grew that beard again.
- l thought you might feel that way.
Here's group leader 1.
- Well, for the time being.
lt's fucking great to see you guys.
Any questions?
Great. Let's go.
Signaler, the locals say the Taliban
bugged out north and south -
when they saw us arrive.
Signaler, will you cover me
if l run out in the field?
Probably not.
- This is damn depressing.
All dressed up
and no one to blow. This won't do.
Danna bet?
- Nothing will happen.
Nothing will happen?
It's no fun betting when we agree.
Daniel, how about stripping
and running naked across the field?
That might kick things up a notch.
- His pink body will scare them off.
Shut the fuck up.
The other day...
My house was bombed.
My cow was killed,
and two calves.
They didn't die,
they were wounded.
A cow was killed.
Two calves were injured.
Our guard dog
was also blown to bits.
Look.
The animals were tied up in here.
There are 19 of us.
The cow gave us milk.
Now we have nothing, no money.
- We can compensate you for it.
Hello. How are you?
Can you come to the camp
this evening or tonight?
lt's vey difficult.
People get killed. They're afraid.
But it's important
that we collaborate.
So we can make peace here.
God willing, we can bring peace
to this place. Rebuild the county...
Exactly, but we'll see.
God will provide.
We... the county is exhausted.
2-1, can we move forward,
or do we wait?
Having a nice time?
- We don't have to cuddle up.
