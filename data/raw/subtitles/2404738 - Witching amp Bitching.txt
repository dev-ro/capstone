Green soldier.
A Child. This is The Chosen One !
- A yellow sponge?
Shut up, Mother.
The fourth man riding a white horse
with a green head light.
Either one , or two .
- It is a taxi.
Sun. Lots of sun .
The great work .
I see gold.
The gold is the key.
Gold ? Gold.
Gold.
Gold.
The great whore of Babylon
with seven heads
is here among us.
She tries to cheat us
with her lies.
The only thing she wants
is to devour our souls.
Do not let this whore
seduce you .
The only thing she really wants
is to restore pagan power.
Gold , gold paid in weight.
We're all here .
You moved. You moved, I saw you .
Mom.
Good afternoon. How are you, lovely?
What blue eyes .
There you are . Here ...
Will you go to the little room with me?
Say something to me,
these are so good Nati
20 grams, 400 Euros .
- But they're my mother's!
I think only about you
I swear.
Done.
It's open.
Everyone on the floor.
This is a robbery!
Put everything in the bag.
Quickly !
Sergio , take everything.
- The clocks too ?
No, they're not worth anything . Get the rings.
They are real gold.
Sergio, get the pips.
Let's go .
Certainly!  You have no shame
to put a child in the middle of this.
One more word and
I kill you.
He is reasonable.
This child needs to be in school.
Shut up, bitch !
Keep your head down !
What 's going on ?
We're almost done, almost done.
- You brought the boy are you crazy ?
I take him on Tuesdays and alternate weekends.
I will not lose one day for a robbery.
Anything could happen to him .
It is not done this way.
He had to walk in and take the money, and
I am doing this for him.
so we can be together .
Sergio, come here.
You understand that I'm doing this for you, right?
- Sure, Dad. I see.
Who do you want to stay with?
Mom ?
Or with me?
- With you , Dad.
He wants to be with me.
I do this for my son.
And if I have to go to jail, I'll go to jail .
I am up to my testicles in paying compensation
to these judges and his witch of a mother.
Jesus is right.
The judges are always on their side.
Between the child support,
and what I must pay
for school and insurance
and I have no money for rent.
Have you ever thought
she thinks you ran off with another woman?
How will I run away with someone if I'm sleeping in my car?
That's enough!
You!  Don't move .
Son of a bitch!
Run! Run!
Watch out!
Let's go
You son of a bitch!!
Get out of the way! Run motherfucker!
Come on ! Run!
Let's go!
Out of the way, lady.
Run Jesus!  Run for your life!
I don't know where he is.
Sleeping, probably.
Take the child Jesus !
What did you tell him?
Are you stupid.
?
Listen,
I have to go.
Run!
Sonia !
-Stop bitch!
Don't think that I don't hear you.
Sonia ! Sonia!
Where are you going ? Stop!  Stop!
I'm behind the wheel.
- Stop!
Do you know her ?
- That's my girlfriend .
That has taken the car for herself?
You son of a bitch !
To the M-30. Step on it!
Where do you want to go?
To Mendez Alvaro or through the tunnels?
Wherever you want , asshole .
- Shut up .
Whichever route is convenient .
Are you a dickhead ?
- Me?
Why did you tell your girlfriend where the car was?
- I did not tell her anything motherfucker.
She knows everything. I don't
have to tell her, she just guesses.
The other day, at the club  - I go out and
she's there at the door waiting for me.
Dad, there's a man here.
- Not today, champ.  Not today.
You'll live better without her. You'll be more calm.
Help! Help!
Get down!  Get down !
Jesus!
The cab is occupied .
- Should we wait for a free one ?
Since it does not seem bad,
its better to go by the Vicente Calderon .
I say this because at this time there is less traffic .
Fuckers! Bastards !
- I do not see anything!
" Armageddon ."
.
Here, its your mother.
Mom.
- How are you, son?
Great!
- Have you had lunch?
No lunch.
- Why not?
And I still have not done my homework.
- Why?
I'm riding in a taxi with Dad .
- Where are you going ?
The police are chasing us
- What?
Give me the phone .
- We held up a shop.
Give me the phone please .
- We have a bag full of gold.
Give me the phone fucker.
- Give it to your father.
Hi, Sylvia, how you doing ?
Yes, I'm...
Playing with the kids in the park. Yes. Yes.
Well, now... now...  we do
homework and lunch, and ...
everything else.
Sorry, but I have to go. Sorry, sorry.
Jose ? What 's going on?
Let me off here .
Please, Help! Police! Help! Police!
- What are those shouts? Jose?
Get me out of here, please !
Police!
Get back here asshole !
Can you lock the doors ?
- Yes, the child locks.
Jose, by the gods, what's going on there?
- Excuse me, Sylvia.
Are you listening?
- Yes.
What are you going to feed your child ?
- We have a few sandwiches and cola.
Do I ask you what you give him for lunch?
Don't be nasty!
- I'm not being nasty
as it happens you get on my nerves, asking
what I do with the kid.
-What did you say?
I don't have to give you explanations.
And because I 'm his father,
With me is perfect!
Accelerate or I'll smash your head.
I have to leave you. I'm going. Bye bye .
Step on it !
Step on it !
Sergio , are you okay ?
- This is just like Grand Theft Auto San Andreas !
Now where to? To the Burgos highway,
the Zaragoza, the Extremadura or go south?
To the south! To the south!
- To the south , why?
Because they always escape to the south. To Mexico .
That is in the movies.
- To Portugal ?
Let's go to France.
- Why France?
Because I'm going to live in Disneyland,
its in Paris.
I did not say exactly that we would live there, Sergio.
We'll go visit,
and then we'll see, Right?
- Can you picture me in Disneyland ?
You can go wherever the hell you want.
- Yeah, but this is not right.
You take your child to a robbery
and now he decides where we escape?
We can not give in to his every whim.
Don't get carried away.
Tell him!  Tell him!
- Excuse me .
If we are to go to France
I need to call my wife
and tell her that I will not be home for dinner.
- Give me the phone.
She will be furious. She'll be furious.
Put your hands where I told you sir .
Watch your hands!
He won't take my call.
he can't even answer his telephone.
May be his phone is out of range .
- Really? His conscience is out of range.
Do you know how much alimony he owes me?
For three months.
Three months he pays nothing
for his son !
The child has an old uniform.
Would it break his back to go to work?
Have you thought about shared custody?
I thought about sending him
to jail for non-payment.
And to you I'm going to give a sedative,
You seem very nervous.
- But I'm fine .
Shared custody...
I have filed a lawsuit with Family Court.
and then the next time
he sees his son will be from behind prison glass.
Maybe then he'll wake up .
Take this man!
Do you not see this is very serious ?
25 000 gold rings
were stolen by armed bandits
from pawnshop
Puerta del Sol .
The whole idea came from Jesus.
- Who is Jesus?
What did he say?
- I do not know .
How do you not know ?
Are you a translator?
He said, " I do not know ."
No one knew
the names of others.
Tell them to drop the masks.
Now!
Come on !
Fuck.
We only met them in the shop . We took
no money and I sold what little I got.
St. Jude Miracle Worker .
Patron saint of hopeless cases.
The job was a piece of cake .
Lots of gold, little security,
We had to enter the shop ,
without drawing attention.
I got it.
- You'll see I catch on.
Are you all street entertainers on the plaza ?
He says " no."
- How not?
Are you fucking with me? . Is that what you wear?
- Work clothes?
Sergio . Sergio ?
What 's going on?
Are we together in this , huh?
We're together.
That's what we wanted , right?
He's ten years old for the love of the gods!
He's been in an extreme situation.
He's in shock ,
traumatized for life .
Do you have children?
- I think not .
Then shut up about it. You have no idea.
- But if this is by the book, it's going to ruin his whole life.
-What book?
You haven't read a book in your whole bastard life.
Take care please. Weapons are very dangerous
in tight spaces, you know.
I do not want to be a nuisance,
you've had enough already
But I urgently need to go to Badajoz
I have to go to work there.
I'll cry because I haven't done my homework.
- We'll do it when we get there . Okay?
Mom told me that I have to
to do homework first .
Do what I say.
You're not with Mom, you're with me.
With Mom you do what she says,
and with me, do as I say.
We're going to do homework
but not right now.
Later, you hear?
Cops!.
Okay, there, there.
Let's see Sergio , what do we do now?
What do we do now?
I left my backpack in the shop
with my homework inside
on the counter.
Say what?
- What do we do? Do we go back?
One moment, one moment, one moment.
Remember when you started
the school year
and got your textbooks
what I told you?
Yes.
- And what did I say?
To write my name, address
and phone number on the first page
in order not to lose them .
- Did you do it?
No.
YES !
Sergio Fernandez Avenida Logio no 5
Mom : 690 389689  Dad : 646 704334
Yes, it's me .
Yes, that's my son .
No, he's with his father.
What happened?
Where did you say?
No, no . It can not be .
You must have a made mistake. Are you sure its him?
Yes.
Yes. I get it.
I get it.
This is not good , ma'am . What are
we to do? This one is very damaged.
This was taken at our wedding.
- But we can't see his face.
I kept one wedding photo
because my father is in it.
We need one where we can see his face
for identification .
This is what I have.
This is from when we opened a video store .
And then this one when we opened a convenience store.
- For food?
We were selling cartridges for printers.
I told him it was a bad idea,
but he never listened to me...
And this is when we opened a Chinese restaurant.
And the Chinese burned it .
This is dad's funeral .
The poor man could not last long.
He was covering our expenses.
You'll have to do a composite photo .
Of my father ?
- No, of your husband .
Keep in mind he committed a robbery in a public place
with the help of your son.
What? With my son?
- What are you telling me?
I'm sorry, I thought you told her.
- You can't say things like that
We have to wait for the psychologists Jaime!
Come here .
- Calmly
Here , here. Take it easy.
Sit here for a moment.
Calm down, okay? Calm down.
Right here. Look .
He's naked?
- ah no, he's dressed as Jesus Christ
with silver paint like a street performer.
-Or that's what we all thought .
Sergio!
- Sylvia ! Sylvia ! Calm down !
Sylvia , calm down !
We are doing everything possible
to find your son .
Sylvia !
Talk to her!
Give us a photo of the boy she raised!
I've gone too far and said too much.
I don't want to upset her.
We need to be able to contact you.
If he calls, tell us immediately. Okay?
Listen!  You are in no condition to drive.
We need to follow her.  Send someone to watch
her house and follow her around the clock.
Send someone?  There's no one Jaime.
We have to follow her.
Run and get the car keys .
Go on, fucker .
Sergio. Sergio, my dear,
Pick up the phone , please.
I have already forgotten your faces , I swear it .
In addition, what have you really done?
Stealing?  Who doesn't steal these days ?
Please leave me at the road side
so I can to go to Badajoz .
I will not tell nobody nothing .
Dad, I'm hungry .
- We can not stop
before we cross the border, Sergio .
- Mom says to eat 5 times a day.
Mom tells you what she wants .
- Jesus, the child is entitled to eat .
We're not going to make it to France hungry and tired.
We'll have to stop soon.
We have to stop soon to eat and talk.
Can you hear me?
He's seen our faces.  It's stupid to think that Badajoz
won't remember us.
This is not a sightseeing trip.
The police have seen us.  And I'm not Jesus.
And what should I call you? Mohammed ?
- And I'll call you toy soldier right?
Fine .
- His name is Jose.
Jose Fernandez Cuesta . And he's divorced.
He wants joint custody.
but my mom refused because he is irresponsible.
- Now listen to me .
Your mother is right. Sorry, Jose.
But this is not right.
I am Tony, dude.
- Fuck off. I don't care .
I'm Manuel.  -It's nice to meet you.
- My name is Manuel Sanchez Garcia.
I have three children and live in Aluche .
- Whatever. Okay?
This is Marquitos.
He cries when I go to work.
This is Alejandro, my oldest
And my daughter Laura .
She loves me so much, she has put my picture
next to that of Justin Bieber .
Why are you telling me this ?
- It's nice, no?
Because I do not want to be murdered ,
just because you do not know me,
like a man of Badajoz.
- Who's talking about killing anyone?
And we have a lot in common.
Women have destroyed my life.
My mother my sister and my wife are friends, you know.
They were staying in the cafe Corte d'Ingles
to gossip about me .
In school its the same, some tell everything to others.
- They are like a coven, sharing information.
Come on .
Let's not become male chauvinists, please.
On the other hand, I confess
that I adore women.  Adore them.
- Me too.
For example, my Sonia who I live with.
She's amazing .
- The one who took our car?
She did not know .
How could I tell her I was taking it for a robbery ?
And the car is hers?
- Yes. Yes.
And the car , the house , the dog ...
It's an awesome boxer named Lollipop.
Lollipop? What do you do besides robberies ?
- Me?
You, who else ?
- Public Relations at Club Sperm.
Now the club is closed .
Some fool died in the toilet.
What is Club Sperm?
- Disco .
Because it closed, I had to do the robbery.
I don't dare tell Sonia I'm unemployed.
She 's a lawyer. Handles many tough cases .
She works hard and then when she comes home
she wants to fuck and not listen to my
problems . You know ?
Or, you're afraid of her.
- Afraid ?
Well, yes , I guess I'm afraid of her.
Sergio .
Sergio , pick up the phone , please.
She is very strong and super smart.
Fuck, I never even got my GED.
I am not good enough for her.
I'm a complete failure.
And at work, at home,and in bed.
She's very good, she blows me away.
You have a problem in bed?.
- You didn't say you were good.
I'm under too much pressure
She comes home from the court and says :
" Tony, what's for dinner? "
And I don't cook
because I do not understand the stove.
It has all these buttons.
And I put the frying pan on the stove
and it does not warm up.
You know what I'm saying?
Then we go to bed.
She grabs me by the throat like a beast
until I can not breathe .
All the blood goes to my head,
and goes around and around...
And not to my...
- Cock?
Sergio !
- Did you know that 52% of men over 30
are unable to complete intercourse ?
- Did you learn that in school ?
No, I read it
in Mom's " Cosmopolitan".
Listen to me , this is a lie .
They make up whatever statistics as they want .
- I'm only 26.
And it happened to me once.
- Go on.
She was a perfect woman .
Breasts, thighs. Everything took
my breath away .
Just like in a porno movie.
We were fooling around ...
and I was simply not able to perform.
I was getting scared..
Finally I was able because I covered her with a blanket.
- What if she dumps me ?
And finds someone better ?
- They are like a curse .
They're like demons.
They leave you a madman.
Because they leave you, because they stay ...
because they don't stay
Dude, they get into that place
in your brain and...
You kill yourself for one of these!
And when she catches you,
its better to cut off your finger .
We're taking it up the ass!
I've put up with this for too long .
I'm with you guys . If I've not
robbed a bank is because I never had the balls .
Thank you.
- and one more thing.
No need more to keep me
at gunpoint . Tony. Jose.
Consider me part of the gang.
- And why is that ? You want a share of the gold?
No, I just want to say that ...
- Why should we believe you ?
Dad , the police are chasing us .
No, wait . I'll get us away.
Buckle up , guys.
Jose.
- Do not pull on it, do not pull .
Then it will be stuck.
Sergio, help him.
I'm going to put my balls into this.
Hold on .
Be careful.
- Trees !
Hold on .
- No.
Did we get rid of them?
- Let's do it again !
Are you okay?
- Let's do it again!
Sergio .
- Again !
A few hours after the Politbuto announced
the opening of the Berlin border ,
all residents rushed to break
the wall and dispose of visas ,
as they no longer need them .
What are you doing, you wretch ?
Get out of here .
- Booze , booze .
How many times have I told you not to touch
that drawer. That's not for you .
Booze , booze , booze, booze .
Booze, booze .
You'll get your booze .
Give me that bottle.
And get away from the bar.
The horse of swords...
- Somethings wrong with the television!
Then put a tape in.
Can't you see I'm busy .
Maritxu !
Already dry, are you ?
i'll say something more.
You have no sense of humor .
This program gives me the ability
to laugh at you with impunity .
What are you complaining about?
You will become more young and beautiful .
I'm going to make you a brunette.
It rejuvenates . Blonde
is no longer in style. It's so over.
I don't want brunette.
- Tempermental!  You're too tempermental.
Hello. I don't want to be a brunette
Marixtu!
Marixtu! Listen to me,  I don't want brunette
I don't want it . Wash it out now .
I don't want brunette
Do you have any soup?
Yes.
Three soups then.
- Where is your bathroom?
Take a Right and left.
- Thank you.
Goodnight .
Dad, can I go play ?
- No.
Thank you.
- Sergio .
Jose. Jose Jose.
- What is it?
He died right ?
He happened to be drunk... drunk... drunk...
- Jose Moreno ?  -Yes.
Bitter as always
- When was this?
She's not very young, is she?
One day the television went out.
Poor reception .
These are tapes, no one watches them,
so I'm playing them .
They're my memories.
On the night of the festival, a special night
boys and girls, so happy.
- Don't you have cable ?
Once a gentleman came by to tell
us I don't know what
But he couldn't cheat me.
He wasn't going to suck my blood. .
To get to the village, go up the hill
and right after it, you're at the border .
What's its name ?
- What?
The village.
- Zugarramurdi .
The village of witches !
- What witches ?
There was a witches sabbath or something, no?
And then they burned them .
I have no fear of witches.
I fear only sons of bitches .
They are numerous and everywhere.
This is good soup, right?
- Yes , it's very tasty .
Gotcha!
He enters the mouth
and comes out the ass .
I said Ass. Ha ha ha!
I thought you'd be scared,
but you seem to like it.
When you come out, you're never the same .
- Why?
Baga, biga, higa ...
(A popular old Basque folk song...)
Laga, boga, sega ...
(written as a witches' incantation)
Zahi, Zohi, bele...
Harma, tiro, PUM!
I do not agree with you.
- Because here they've given  you a delegation, Mr. Macho.
There's sherry,
ham,
and what is that other flavor?
Soup is soup.
What is it? Are you okay?
The demon does not have a tail,
but she's got a cunt like a cave.
My advice
Do not think I say nonsense without thinking.
Never say anything to contradict them.
- Who ?
Agree with everything she says
It's for the best.
The one who warns you is not a traitor.
- What are you telling them?
Shut up!  You talk too much
Get in the kitchen!
And do not eat up today's special.
Come on, everything's okay.
Let's go!.
Look here a minute!
I shit on your whore mother!
Bastards! Sons of bitches !
What is going on ?
Hi! I wanted to say something else.
Thank you man.
Let me out, please!
Bastards!
Hey, friends!
Let me ride with you! Where are you going?
Do you want to be my friends?
Good bye!
Sons of bitches!  I can't take this anymore!
On the night of the festival, a festive night.
Boys and girls are happy...
They're definitely working together!
They steal the gold
she creates a distraction,
then they meet up in Paris
and live it up.
You think? I think she just wants to get
her son back. She's a worried mother.
It seems they never think
what they seem to think.
And what do they think?
- I do not know, but they think differently .
They are spiders
They weave their webs around you.
Webs are comfortable,
pleasing, we feel safe
in the bitch's web and then, Bang!.
They inject you with their poison.
- Problems with Rachel ?
-With Rachel, none.
She changed the PIN codes
on the credit cards.
Alfonso, has she left you without money?
I learned it from the bank statements
I can not go home.
She changed the locks?
- And threw my clothes in the trash.
Didn't you have a girlfriend?
- Me? Girlfriend?
or something like that .
Leave her before she leaves you.
Because once she finds out
she has your balls,
she takes them,
She rips them off!
" Zugarramurdi - 2 km. "
I don't want to go here.
- What is it?
I will not go there.
- Don't fuck with me now
Jose, this village is cursed.
Here they celebrate the witches' sabbath, you know>
What is witches' sabbath?
- Like a party, but in the Middle Ages .
Shut up.
- Listen . We're in no condition
at 5 in the morning. Right?
This is serious. Look ...
I didn't say this,
because I didn't understand at the time,
But in their toilet ... There was a man.
- And ?
But if it was a girl ...
- It was a man. He was inside the hole .
Where?
- Fuck, It is so hard to explain.
In the hole.  One eye.
Looking at me!
Listen ... Manuel .
Manuel.
It's a cry for help, no?
First thing, relax.
You had a tense moment
and it is not easy, not easy.
Do we agree?
- We agree, and we're all very tired.
And we're going to drive through the village calmly.
After half an hour we will be in France.
And nothing more will happen to us.
Nothing more.
Nothing else will happen to us? No, Jose.
How do you not understand?
Witchcraft, the practice, it was born here.
Right here, in a cave.
Demons, human sacrifices, everything.
Really. I'm not making this up,
It's historical fact.
And where have you read this, in Weekly World News?
- No, in Great Mysteries.
I've spent hours reading at
the airport, the taxi stand ... It is my obsession.
On top of that, all this bad karma we have.
- The gold? What's wrong with the gold?
It is not the gold, It's the rings .
The wedding rings.  You said it before!
This bag is filled with
thousands of broken promises
Lost dreams, contempt, hatred,
failures, infidelities, deceptions, lies!
Fuck, you're giving me bad vibes, Manuel .
- Or ... are you saying?
-that this is Mordor
and we carry the precious?
On the road I saw two witches.
Look what you've done. You scared him !
- If that is...!
Start the car .
Take it easy.
Sergio, relax, okay?
We're going to a lovely village,
with charming people and ancient traditions.
Pay attention!
- And nothing else is going to happen .
Look out!  Look out!
Did you see that ? Did you see her ?
Fuck!
Sergio, get in the car.
- But Dad...
I said get in the car!
Boy, what happened?
What happened? Boy!
20 years of driving a taxi,
and I never had a single scratch.
But this was such a minor scratch.
Looks fine, right?
Why didn't I stay home, Fuck!
Let me out you bastards!
We should call an ambulance.
- Sure. And the insurance company and police. Right, fucker?
Don't touch her!
- Damn! You've spooked me, fucker!
Why? We had an accident,
We're helping her, right?
Let's see if she's dead or alive.
- If she's dead, then... it doesn't matter.
No, that's not what we're going to do,
it's not,I told you!
I told you!
- We'd better go before someone comes .
From the bar!
What's she doing here ?
No pulse .
- Dear god, I've killed her !
I've killed her, I've killed her, I've killed her!
What the hell is this Jose ?
No! Don't! Don't ever open it!
- But why?  Why?
Can't you see ?
She's a witch !
If not, how else is she here before us?
- It's true! We're getting in the car, dude.
Leave her.
- I want to know what the fuck's inside.
Jose, leave it, let it go.
- No,  I want to see what the fuck's inside.
Drop it dammit!  Just drop it!
- What a pair of children. Drop it .
Leave it, let it be !  Drop it!
- What's this shit inside... ?
What was inside?
I got some in my mouth!
This can't be!
What is it?
- The old woman disappeared!
I'm going to go fucking crazy
Sergio, Sergio ...
Sergio, did you see anything ?
- She flew away.
What a little joker.
No, really, what did you see ?
Maybe it was an amulet for protection.
Or a potion.  Or poison,
we don't know the side effects...
Shut your damn mouth.
I don't want any more bullshit.
This dude is too much, Jose.
Yeah, bullshit. But where's the old lady, eh?
- She's like that ghost lady
who appears on highways and warns of danger
She warns people because she died there.
- But she didn't say anything?
Because we hit her.
but later, in time, she will appear to others.
Sure, and she'll tell them she was hit by a taxi from Madrid.
- This.
As soon as we get to France
we'll stop at the first place we find, split the rings,
and leave separately.
-I don't want to see you guys ever again.
We're in Zugarramurdi.
Good, well that's it, no?
Nothing has been good for us
What's this?
Holy shit!
Drive!
Swerve!  Swerve!
- What should I do, hit her?
Swerve!
- Stop the fucking cab!
Good evening.
- Good evening.
I'm sorry to bother you at this hour, but
Have you seen an old lady
in black, with long, loose hair?
No. No.
- Nope.
She is my mother.
She's a bit crazy, you know?
We're not from around here, ma'am.
We're going to France, just passing through.
Usually, she's okay,
Even at her age, she still works...
But sometimes she forgets
to take her medicine ...
Sorry, ma'am,
but we can't help you.
Well then,
I guess I'll keep looking .
Pardon me.
- No need.
I know this is a lot to ask, but ...
would you be so kind as to
to take me home?
Surely she's there.
- We are in a great hurry, ma'am .
You have no idea the rush we're in.
- And the meter is running.
Don't worry yourselves, I can go alone.
I had hip surgery,
But my doctor told me
a little exercise would not be harmful .
I'm sorry. Good night.
- Good night.
And you are? Don't you talk?
Has the cat got your tongue ?
What is your name, handsome?
Sergio .
- And I'm Graci.
I'm actually Graciana Barrenetxea.
Like my mother, grandmother and great-grandmother .
- You are Basque?
Barren-etxea ... " sweeps the house ".
I had a girlfriend from Basauri
and I learned a bit, you know?
Here it is.
My husband did not like
to come here much.
And finally we got divorced.
After the divorce, he became a priest.
Can you believe that?
Eva!
I found nothing. She wasn't at the bar or
anywhere else.
She's probably inside.
The door looks broken.
She probably forgot her keys.
- Good, we'll we need to be going.
There's no hurry, right?
I mean an elderly woman, alone,
anything could happen to her .
Like being hit by a car, or something.
Why a car?
It could be a tractor.
Well, we gotta go,
it's very late and the child needs to sleep.
Sergio ! Sergio !
I am Tony, princess.
Sergio ! Sergio !
Sergio !
Wow, please pardon this mess,
we did not expect guests.
That boy is up to something.
Children are like that.
My brother and I drove them crazy
in this house when we were little.
It's like a maze.
- You have a brother ?
Yes, a younger one.
But my mother keeps him chained and locked up.
Fuck, that's a great idea.
It's the only way. Lock them up
to make them do their homework.
Come on.
I do the same with Sergio
no television,
no internet and no cell phone, you know
This is Francisco, my great-grandfather .
He was a shepherd. He built this
place on an ancient altar .
He had to sell a lot of sheep to build this, no?
- One day he woke up and they were all dead.
As he was very superstitious
he got on a boat and left for Cuba.
To buy sugar?
- No, slaves.  It was legal back then.
And this goes down to the cellars. There are tunnels,
that join the caves
from the village to France.
We move tobacco, weapons and such.
Gotta make a living, right?
Begonia disappeared down there one day
but returned after a month.
What do you think happened?
- I have no idea.
Mama loved to scare us, she told us she was a witch
and that they buried her face down.
Face down?
- Yes, face down .
Instead of face up in the coffin, like everyone
else, she was face down.
And so if your try to dig out with your fingernails,
you'll be digging further down .
Understand?
- Yes, that makes sense.
Free admission .
- What is it?
Public Relations.
Come any time.
Haven't we already passed this?
-He was here.  And my grandmother.
Kids and old people are so much alike.
- They're playing together.
It is possible,
Sergio is very affectionate. He chatters with anyone.
You are an indulgent father.
- Indulgent?
It's because he's divorced.
- Yes, but Sergio takes it very well.
You hardly ever see him.
Spends all of his time with mother, poor boy.
Precisely for this reason, you know?
I want him to be with me, so he does not lack a father figure.
This is very important for his development.
- I love children .
I'm like a child.
I just love to play .
You do? And what do you like to play?
- Doctor .
And you?
- The PSP.
FIFA, Monster Hunter, Grand Theft Auto ...
Me, I love to play with food.
I love food.
If you want, I'll cook you something now.
You can't even fry an egg.
And it comes with ulterior motives... no?
Want me to show you my room ?
All my toys are there .
I think that's a tremendous idea.
But first, don't you have to find your son?
Yeah, right.
- Yes.
He seems a very bright child.
- Yes, When you get to know him, you will love him.
He is very smart . And mature, and good.
He's cheerful, loving, sensitive .
Where has this son of a bitch gotten to now?
Fuck!
You don't know how sorry I am .
It's all my fault.
I didn't need to distract them
with my problems.
You're not responsible, ma'am.
The child should have been with his mother from the start.
What are you doing Mother?
- What I want to do.
Does it matter?
-My dear, I see what you're doing!
Get away from there!
No!
Sergio !
No, this is wrong.
Mom, this is wrong, understand?
- What are they doing here?
I'm so sorry,
she is not right in the head .
She's in psychiatric treatment,
and is on a lot of medication.
When she takes the pills she becomes disoriented.
Disoriented? What did she say?
-Forgive me!
Please, Please, Jose.
Forgive us .
What's important is
nothing has happened to the child!
Open the door, give me the boy.
Give me the boy!
Drive, Manuel !
And you mother, we 'll talk later.
Talk to me with respect,
I breast fed you .
Do not you realize who they are?
- The taxi driver, soldier, Jesus...
And the Chosen one.
You almost ruined everything.
I almost roasted him!
-They caught you just in time, Mother...
Fortunately, his father pulled him
out of the oven in time.
I like him a lot mother.
- And you've done nothing to make him stay?
What do you want me to do?
- What you do always.
Not this one.
He is different.
I called my brother-in-law about a replacement
and I have to miss work!
Why? I'm a good person.
I want to go to Badajoz !
One question.
I want to go to Badajoz!
Do we have a plan for this one?
I want to go to Badajoz !
Thank you. Friends,
thank you.
Maybe you're human after all.
Shit.  What is it?
Can we talk about this?  Can we talk man?
Bastards !
There.  When they find him,
we'll be with Mickey Mouse.
Wait!
- Dad, my back burns.
Don't scratch.  Don't scratch it, Sergio.
- Jose, it's going to peel.
Look, Sergio, look.  Here's the border.
Once we cross, I'll buy you aspirin and skin cream.
A French one is best.
- And bottles of Moet et Chandon.
Fine, let's not blow it in the home stretch.
- Okay?
Have we changed the license plates?
- Yes.
We hid the guns?
- Yes.
Where is the bag ?
- Bag ?
The bag with the rings .
- You had it!
Shit.
- What?
For the bag.
- Why?
Turn the car around, we have to go back. I left it.
- the bag ?
No, no, no, no, not the bag, please!
- Fucker.  I lost my head looking for Sergio.
I'm sorry, we have to go back.
- If we go back, will we see the man from Badajoz?
I'm sorry to have offended you.
But I was angry .
I just lost my temper .
Wait, wait . Again?
Please no.
Please. Cut me loose!
Sons of bitches !
Fuck!
Graci ! Eva !
Wait, Jose.
- What what what what?
You can not do this.
It can't be done.
Look, look
Tony , right?
Ever since I met you ,
you've constantly been telling me
it can't be done.
It can't be done.
What the fuck do I do, you see?
Well, I don't know .
I so don't, you know?
Now we have to deal with the daughter
- and what a shame that is .
What? Me? But what have I done?
- So much for that lawyer of yours. Lets go.
And you, indulgent father, "I want him to focus."
You are making that child crazy!
There's the door. Come on.
What is it?
- Nothing.
Is the bag in there?
- Yes. No. Wait ...
No bag, I don't see it.
Out of the way, let me look.
- Quiet .
Wait dickhead.
- Dickhead?
It's very dangerous!
Holy crap ... Mamma mia, mamma mia .
What 's going on?
- Honestly, I don't think I can explain it, Jose
but its not what I expected.
And I thought I'd seen everything at Club Sperma.
We should go get the bag
That's what we came for.
Yes, you go.
I 'll wait .
Jackpot! Jackpot!
- Get out of the fucking way .
What a babe!
- What's she doing with that broom?
Not sweeping, that's for sure .
Go there, go there sweetheart.
We need to focus a bit, you hear?
Yes, I hear you. We need to
remember why we came back here.
We have not come for this. Come on .
Come on.
You're going to ruin the upholstery.
Can't you sit quietly for a moment?
I can't stand this!
Will they be much longer?
They have failed. My lord, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit ...
It's in is there!
What's going on? Who's there?
What are you doing here?
Weren't you going to France?
Why did you come back here?
- Easy, lady.
You came back to rob us?
But we have nothing.
To rob your ass!
You two against the wall!
Lady, against the wall!
- Why do you have guns?
Because of my mother?
But she is harmless.
She has...
- Turn around, Lets go!
... Alzheimers!
I'm not buying it!
Let's get out of here, away from these shitty hosts!
Help me , God Almighty ...
Hold on, Sergio ! Hold on!
Run, Sergio !
If you're going to kill me, kill me already!
I can't stand it anymore!
Please miss ,
Might you tell me what's going on?
Stay back spawn of Lucifer !
- What are you doing ?
I have no idea .
Good evening.
Good evening.
Would you like a splash of sherry ?
- No, thank you.
What's this? I go out for a minute
and you're all over her.
Don't you see that this is a lady?
Now get back in the kitchen!
It seems there's no phone coverage.
- Here there is no coverage. No signal, nothing .
A lot of people must pass through here,
but would you remember
a man of about 30, vulgar
and not handsome with a boy?
I have not seen them .
- The boy is my son .
A blond boy... looks a lot like me.
No.
- He doesn't look like me?
I said that I did not see anything.
A vulgar man, not very handsome ...
- Sound familiar?
Is he your husband?
- How did you know?
Because I'm a witch.
Then have you seen him?
- No.
Can I use your bathroom?
In the back, on the right.
Senora .
Yes.
- Do you have a cigarette ?
What?
- Give a smoke and I'll tell you .
What?
- That I want to eat figs!
Go away. Leave me alone.
- Your son, I could just eat him up.
You saw him? Where'd they go?
- Cigarette .
Will you tell me now?
Are you there?
Fuck.
Attention, this is Inspector Alfonso Calvo,
accompanied by Jaime Pacheco ...
in persuit.
We need reinforcement units
at the  border crossing.
- We need at least two patrol cars .
Repeat. This is Inspector Alfonso Calvo
and Jaime Pacheco .
We need two patrol cars .
The bread, bread ane wi-... No.
It's the bread, bread and wine, wine ...
What are you doing?
Go and grab a box .
Go on lazybones, you are such a lazybones!
I don't know how I stand you.
One day...
Let's go old woman, let's go!
It's not working.
Fine, Try calling on the mobile.
I already tried, there's no signal.
Moreover, the radio is for official use.
Man, the official thing to say is
"Inspector Jaime Pacheco."
But I said that.
- No Alfonso, you said Inspector Alfonso Calvo
and Jaime Pacheco .
I am also an inspector.
No, no, no, no, no, I said two inspectors .
I said, "Inspector Alfonso Calvo
and Inspector Jaime Pacheco."
- You did not! Inspector Alfonso Calvo and then...
accompanied by ...
- Enough!
I'm sure they never even heard us.
- It's just a detail.
Because you think I'm going to accompany you everywhere.
- No, not as a companion...
Jaime, but as a partner.
- I am the same as you, neither more nor less .
You don't notice and just give me orders .
You say only start, pull out, faster, slower, you see?
I guess I'm just the one that drives.
while you sleep, and gets the gas
and brings you donuts, and puts in the CDs.
I don't know, Jaime, what do you want me to say?
- What?
A word of thanks, at least, a gesture.
Something affectionate.
Something affectionate?
No, do not call her,
she always talks too much.
This girl, I do not know her. It is luck.
Our destiny.
We thought we had lost them,
and they suddenly returned.
Yes.
Bah!
His father and a couple of friends.
as you can imagine...
Yes.
Yes, yes . It's better than missing the whole thing.
Jose.
Yes, you're right.
Entrees, we already have.
I said yes to the Urdangoitis,
and told them to bring the bread. And bring ice.
Jose, Jose , listen.
- Shut up
-First dinner...
I entrusted you with my son, and you lose him .
- At least he's not here, he managed to escape.
This can't be fucking happening.
- Maybe we're dreaming?
It's not a dream. All three of us can't have the same dream.
- We're not dreaming, it's a hallucination.
They drugged us .
Do you remember the old woman's sack?
Nightshade, henbane, mushrooms,
natural psychotropics.
Really, Is this a game you learned at the airport?
I must go to Badajoz ...
Badajoz, Badajoz...
So according to you, this is not real ?
- No. It is only in your head.
-These men are obsessed.
Drugs or dream, it is clear
that she prefers you.
Easy, Tony.  Pure suggestion.
For a dinner or a party?
For a dinner, no more than 30 people.
And for the party ...
just imagine... thousands!
No, the boy is not here.
But they have gone to look for him. I don't know how late...
Mom ! Mom !
Over here! Over here! Over here!
Did you see that ?
- See what?
I don't know, a malnourished wild boar without hair.
- No, that would be a suckling pig .
Something more rare, you think?
- No, no, who's going to fucking stop!
Keep going or we'll lose her.
- See? You're giving orders again!
Drive!  Come on!  Drive!
Want me to take the fucking wheel, Jaime?
Stop!
There are witches in a house.
My father is with them.
They tried to bake me in the oven .
And they threw a man as if he was a ball.
Get in the car. Get in.
No! No! No!
Where are you going, pigeon?
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!
In the car!
-Party night, a special night
What 's happening?
My whole body hurts.
I think I broke something.
Where are we?
Open!
Just a moment...
All right.
Another second.
Fuck.
- Done.
Good.  Now I need only the balls of a priest
and tears of the innocent.
I swear that I am innocent of nothing.
I'm a thief .
Practically a murderer .
- Really?
You know who is a very good person?
Him.
He is smug.
Because he has a heart too big for his chest.
Liar! I drink a lot.
I have no good qualities.
It's true Eva.
I'm really bad person.
See? This 'tears of the innocent' thing is screwed.
But the testicles...
He's not a priest,
but he seems like one.
I've never even been confirmed.
I don't want to quarrel
- There's no quarrel.  It's him. He started it.
Can you not shut up?
- Come, let's kiss and make up.
Yes, there is food for everyone.
Of course, as always.
We'll expect you.
Eva , how many times have I told you
not to play with your food.
And the tooth does not work,
it must be from a hangman.
No, my daughter.
Fooling about as always.
What? Yes, I'll tell her .
but I understand
its her age ...
Hey! I'm not worth it, no?.
I'll leave you to talk amongst yourselves.
What are you up to?
Hello Eva !
- How are you?
Some wine.
- Thank you.
Come in, come in .
- Thank you, darling.
Hello, how are you dear?
Look what I brought .
- that's rich. come in .
Good evening.
I hope we are not early.
- No, you came! What did you bring?
A few little things to nibble.
- As you don't know us well, I'm glad you came.
Look, do you know who this is?
- Eva !
How you've grown up!
Your mother told us that
you had gone to study abroad .
- Yes, in Germany.
With the priests?
- Yes, at the University of Tubingen, theology.
You've already passed them all, right?
- Well, I do what I can.
You said yes. Fucks like a bitch, lies about everything
and deceives men.
You are at that age,  Right?
Obviously. I love what you've done with the house.
- You like it?  Mom's behind it.
Hello. How are you?
-Very nice, such detail.
There! there! there! there!
What is it?
- There. She stopped there.
You stopped too fucking close .
Shit!
They're coming. Don't do anything.
- Here's fine.
Did you give me an order?
- Yes.
Let me go!
Sergio !
I want to go home!
She's pulling out, and is going.
What are you up to?
- You'll see
Jaime.
Fuck, Jaime. what are you doing?
- You take the steering wheel.
I'm not your driver, Miss Daisy!
- This is not the time or the place.
Get in the car and drive, for the love of Gods.
- Very well. I do it because I want to,
Not because you ordered me.
- What crap are you giving me, Jaime!
I know you've been following me since
I left Madrid.
Let's say we are steering the investigation
in the same direction as you.
It does not matter!
Do you have guns?
Lady, you're not the one who asks the questions.
- Don't you see?
My son is not with my ex-husband.
Can't you see that he's been kidnapped ?
Fuck!
Run!
Run! Come on!  Let's go!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey!
- Police! Police!
Hey ! Police!
-Alfonso!
- Damn, Sylvia !
Sylvia !
Hey, I forgive you
but you're hurting me very much.
Will you shut up?
- I might fucking cry.
If you're going to cry, cry. But do it quietly. Got it?
- Got it.
Sylvia !
- Sylvia !
You should wait here,
it might be dangerous.
Moreover, I think we all
should wait here .
Secure the perimeter
and call for help.
It doesn't seem right,
the way we are dealing with this.
Alfonso, Look out!
Come, Let's go.
Sylvia get behind me.
Eva, what have you made?
- Fingers .
Not so much fried food,
our guests will be too full for the second course
- Mom,really. Do you have to find fault with everything?
Oh this girl, this girl.
They're eating the man of Badajoz .
- It looks good to me, but pay attention to what I'm saying.
What scares me is that she walks
on the ceiling like its nothing.
Remember that we've been drugged.
- Yes, indeed. I'm not here and my head doesn't hurt.
and they are not eating this guy,
I'm home, relaxed.
Drugs or not,
one thing is certain, Eva likes Jose.
Are you two crazy ?
They want to kill us, and you're thinking about fucking?.
- What you have to do is leave her wanting.
I'm just saying Jose. Do us the favor.
- Manuel is right.
You've been dry, she wants to bag you,
Is that so hard ?
- She almost strangled him!
We're not doing this right, we should follow protocol .
- Exactly.
First secure the perimeter
and then organize the operation. Not like this, its crazy.
Watch out!
- What happened?
I thought I saw someone .
Fuck, you gave me a scare, Alfonso!
- Let me go first .
Senorita , please
What are they going to do to me?
Dad !
- Sergio !
Sergio , are you okay ?
- They brought me a frozen meal,
but with arms and legs, Dad.
- Let him go!
The things this child says...
He's damaged from television .
Here we eat the people,
but with kisses.
We're a little ... clique-ish ,
but then already...
When we know each other,
we give it all.
We like to eat well,
but not dear little boys like you.
Take him to the kitchen.
Quietly, quietly, please.
- You see, eh?
Look out, be careful , please.
Hey! Look out!
Ladies,  A moment of silence, please .
The sauce is so smooth, isn't it?
Silence!
Like every year,
we gather again
to celebrate the end of this civilization,
ridiculous and so stressful
that it overwhelms us with its vulgarity.
We give thanks to the Great Mother
for these gifts
she has bestowed
in her infinite evil .
Because here time passes for no one.
- Be quiet!
What's up there, Sylvia?
What's up there?
The envy corrodes us.
We lie, we cheat, insult out neighbors ...
Vice and lust are our daily bread.
But all this, my daughters,
is not enough.
The False Prophet still
governs on the surface,
And she, despite our efforts,
remains hidden underground.
For centuries, we wait for our Messiah.
destined to die and rise again
through the womb of the Goddess
to lead us to our final victory.
This is not the first time we've tried...
We had 30 boys before this, Graciana .
Not one or two, thirty.
Chubby, precious,
I do not understand how it all went wrong .
Perhaps mother, it was not a matter of quantity,
but quality.
To choose the Messiah is not
like choosing a bingo card.
Certainly, your mother did everything she could.
- More could not be done.
The past is very easy to criticize.
- Thank you,darling.
Very well. The past is past.
The truth is,
we need a miracle.
I hear voices. They are there below.
we celebrate the ritual, after so much time...
Here, here, here!
Where ?
Everything is perfect .
The stars are with us.
Quiet!
The pain and misery that
live in these rings
will give us enough strength,
so the invocation of this year will be a success.
and she will arise from the depths,
the one who reigned in the beginning.
What did she say/
- I do not know such a ritual.
What did she say about a ritual?
Didn't you notice she was talking about a ritual?
Senora, give me the bag.
It will be spoiled!
Who wants to leave with me?
Crush them!
Jose, I see you!
And I will not forget it !
Do you hear ?
Why is your wife here?
- She should run off with your fucking lawyer!
Do not compare them.
At least mine didn't sell us to the police!
You didn't worry much about the police today.
You have to get the rings!
- Are you crazy?  Is this the apocalypse?
We'll see about that.
- Get ready to run ! One, two ...
Where to run?
- It does not matter!  Three!
Hey, are those nettles?
- From the Provincial Institute of Welfare
in Navarra.
- Now you tell me!
I'm glad she found this precious woman.
- She suffered so much with her mother's illness and all.
Poor thing, poor thing.
- How are you feeling , dear?
Has she eaten anything?
Careful, it can be fatal on an empty stomach.
I think I have some antacid.
-No, it's better to give her something hot.
Like lime or mint tea .
Eat, eat, eat, try just a little.
Open. Wider.
This is half-assed.
- It is normal,
she had a stressful trip,
and her head's full of worries...
about these men and her family.
But that's all over, honey.
Don't worry, today you will be treated like a queen .
- Yes, and you're among friends, you'll see.
Follow the corridor to the end,
you'll find a staircase on the left...
Listen to me!  Always go to the left.
When you get to the wine cellar below
you will see a door on the right.
You got that?
Wait for me by the river.
- Got it.
Wait!
And the others?
- What about the others?
They're coming with us, right?
Am I not enough for you?
Yeah, but leaving them like that seems...
Would you rather be with your friends
instead of me?
No, no, no !  What should I say?...
What should I say... What I want is...
If everything goes well... for all of us...
we can all be okay
Do you see?
One minute, tell me you're not saying
what I think you're saying.
Yeah, right . I mean, I'm not quite sure
what to say,
but I will say whatever you want to hear.
You are giving me the logic of fools!
- No. No.
Not that. I would never.
- Do you love me ?
What?
- I betrayed my whole family for you.
I am giving you everything .
- I like you a lot,
very much.
- Yeah!
If you want, I will forget my friends.
But understand,
asking me to leave my son is too much .
- You're just looking for an excuse to dump me .
Dump you? Not for anything in the world,
I'm crazy about you!
But I'm not the most important thing in your life.
Now see here, think about it.
If you're the most important thing in my life,
then...
Should I exclude everything else?
I think its possible to perfectly combine them.
Where is Jose ?
- I don't know.
What do we do ?
- Run!
Run! Run! Run for your life!
Manuel, the bag! Give me the bag!
- I can't go on, Tony.  What do we do?
It has to be here! I remember perfectly!
The patron saint of lost causes!
-What?
Here it is! Here it is ! St. Jude!
Keep running!
Here, Tony !
It's me or nothing.
- It's you, my love.
You forever.
- Lies.
You're just afraid of me.
That ... I will not deny.
It may not be the best time to say this,
but I love you.
You don't love me!
You think I'm a monster.
- What monster? You are my love .
Don't contradict me!
- Fuck! I don't know what to say, nothing is right!
I can't take this!
Do not you think you're taking things
a little too emotionally?
This is incredible.
- and I stopped believing in saints!
Well done, Tony. Things as they are,
we have thrown some eggs.
With two sets of balls!
- What a rush!
This.  This is how its done.
Right now, I could
conquer the fucking world.
I feel alive.
I feel ... like a fucking man .
When I tell all this to Sonia,
she'll be blown away, Manuel.
And you'll also tell her you're unemployed, right?
- Yes, for sure.
and then I'll tell her what I want.
I'll take the bull by the horns
and open my own night club.
It will be my car
my house, my dog.
and I swear it won't be called Lollipop.
And not even the gods will stop me .
Hello?
Hello? Who's there?
Help , I'm ...
Fuck!
I have read the complete works
of Marcial Lafuente Estefania.
- What?
The Cathedral of Burgos.
I made it out of frog bones.
16,000 of them.
- That would take a long time, no?
Almost 15 years.
- yes.
And... have you always been here?
- Yes, I've been here,
And I like it very much.
When you get used to it, it's very cozy.
And that door is always locked.
Let's go this way.
Wait .
Can you feel the air?
- Yes, we must be near an exit!
Tony!
- Manuel!
Shine the flashlight there.
Can you see anything?
- No.
No... I don't know what I'm looking at.
Should we turn back?
- Turn on the light, take another look.
Please.
Don't do anything to us, please.
My sister is the only one who takes care of me.
She brings me the novels.
But now, now its harder
because they do not publish them anymore.
Your sister is charming.
A little quick-tempered,
but charming .
- I'm Luis Miguel .
I am Jose. Jose Fernandez .
My skin falls off,
because of the moisture.
No, it's okay.
I don't mind it.
No?
Come on, take it easy.
There, there, there, its okay.
We are followers of evil, forever.
Shame on you.
- It won't always be this way, lovely.
We'll talk after the ceremony.
- Mother, please.
Do you know the grief you have given your grandmother?
She's more crazy than evil and doesn't remember a thing.
This house has never seen
something like this.
Girls your age
should be doing drugs...
and not wasting their time
with such bullshit.
When I was your age I would put out my ass all day.
-As it should be!
The only purpose men serve
is to extract their money.
Why don't you practice dirty sex
like your friends do?
Sadomasochism, incest,
- Coprophagia, fetishism...
bestiality.
- golden showers, fist-fucking, bondage...
Bondage? What's bondage?
- Please, Conchi, you're behind the times.
The sacrifices we made to send you
to the worst schools,
and now you tell me you like this man,
because he is a good person.
Let's go, please!
But he looks at me with those eyes...
- What eyes?  Pull them out!
What you must do is use him
as if he was a sex toy.
And what would I play with him?  Scattergories?
And when you go, he will start to cry.
- Seriously?
He seems a real ladies' man .
- That's nothing.
Some time ago, in Cosmopolitan
I read that men are becoming more impotent.
I know. You're right.
Why is this happeneing to me?
I'm sorry mother, but...
but whenever I think about him,
I feel butterflies in my stomach.
What does she feel?
- Butterflies.
-Please...
- I think I have fallen in love.
You have what?!
-My grandmother is screaming,
Do you hear it?
No.
- I can hear everything that happens in this house.
Can you hear my son?
He's crying, but its normal,
because they are bringing him
for the sacrifice.
Sacrifice ?
Where is this cave?
Where is this cave?
If you don't want them to see you,
there is a tunnel that goes under the cemetery.
In chapter ten,
The Attitude of the Stupid Sheriff,
this is what happened.
You'll spoil everything,
said the inspector .
Bingo.
They say God created man
in his own image and likeness.
Who the hell do they think they are?
God created woman in her
image and likeness.
Yes !
Some of you swallowed that stupid
story of Adam and his rib?
No!
Where is paradise?
- In Hell!
Who is God?
- The Great Mother !
Who are are we?
Witches !
Men live in fear of us,
because we know the truth.
God is a woman and they can not
bear it.
Enough of good and evil,
of Heaven and hell.
of virtue and sin.
There is only one truth
in the entire universe,
A great almighty goddess,
a cruel mother,
merciless daughter
and pure spirit!
They uprooted our instincts
they fouled us with guilt on our souls
and they spit on our sex.
The time has come for vengeance.
She will return and justice will be done.
Justice!  Justice!
Justice ! Justice !
Justice !
- What are you saying? Are you and idiot?
I do not know .
I got carried away a bit .
She's going to eat him, that's the point.
- Who is she?
If the child survives, he will be reborn.
Like me.
How will he survive if she's going to eat him?
You see me? I managed.
- I prefer not to think to think about it.
Do you hear that?
- What is it?
Rapid breathing, fingernails scratching
wood, there is too little air.
Luismi, don't screw with me, okay?
Fuck!
- Help me . Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Fuck.
- Go ahead.
Did Mom do that?
It's as if I knew.
- Luismi, what are you doing here?
If mom finds out you've left your room...
You were being punished!
I was naughty.
- Untie me .
No fucking way!
You're too much like your mother.
Jose. Don't say that to me.
I thought we had something between us.
Why has your mother chained you?
- I can't tell you that.
She's in love with you!
Luismi .
- You told mother and
she tried to have you buried.
- Luismi, I took care of you!
As soon as I am out of the chains,
I'll kill you both!
And you!  Why? Aren't you going
to say anything?
Say something!
I'm ... sorry, Eva .
I just got out of a relationship.  I'm sorry.
Don't you have the guts?
I don't want to get involved again with
women that make me crazy .
All of the unbalanced ones find me!
I want someone normal,
to go to the movies and to dinner...
- But I'm a very normal person.
Luismi, let's go.
No, no no! Where are you going ?
To stop your mother from destroying
Western civilization .
Do you mind?
- Jose.
You can not talk to me like that.
Luismi! Luismi dear, tell me to come back.
- Luismi, come on.
Luismi! Who loves you more than me?
Luismi, Luismi , I will lock you in your room!
Luismi !
What's that smell?
- I think its sulfur.
No, the hair on my legs
is burning.
How long does it take to burn someone?
- I don't know, its the first time I've been burned,
I think it takes about an hour.
- An hour ?
So long?
- Yes. But first we'll asphyxiate from the smoke.
Ah good, that's less horrible.
- We've got twenty minutes at most.
Alfonso. Alfonso !
- What?
Before I die, I want to tell you that its been
an honor working all these years with you.
And for me too, Jaime .
- I want to tell you something more.
Tell me.
- It gives me great shame.
Come on, Jaime .
We've known each other our whole lives.
But here? In front of everyone?
- It's not like I'm going to run and tell everyone.
Have you never noticed?
- Noticed what?
I did not understand what?
- Even the other day when I fell on you
in the karaoke ?
Come on, tell me now,
you have us on tenterhooks .
I like you.
- What?
As a man, I mean.
Shouldn't we already be burning?
Jaime. I appreciate you very much.
but I think that it is neither the time
nor the place to talk about these things.
Damn you, I'm dying of shame.
- Yes, I understand.
Cheer up, man!
It's not the end of the world.
I'm not sure.
Is it so hard to say something nice?
For the twenty minutes we have left...
- Leave me alone!
I'm uncomfortable and
I need to think!
Why am I here, damn it !
I have not done anything!
Damn! Fuck!
Damn!
Shit!
Sergio! Sergio!
Get me out of here!
Get me out of here!
Papa! Help me!
Help!
What are you waiting for?
See?
He's alive.
He is The Chosen One,
the fruit of the womb of the Great Mother,
The androgyne,
This man who will betray the man,
The Avenger,
our Trojan horse.
Dad!
Dad, I'm fine.
It's okay.
Luismi!
No!
Did I just see that?
Oh, God !
She swallowed him!
We gotta get out of here right now .
- Do you have a plan?
Jose, you have to trust me.
- You know her weak spot?
Yes.
But I need your help .
- What do I have to do?
You alone have to distract her.
- How shall I distract her?
Jose !
Do not let her swallow a morsel!
Stall her, turn over!
- I'll try!
Lower her head!
this way, no, to the right.
Anything else?
- No man, No!  Not like that!
Like that! Like that!?
What are you doing?  This way!
Lower her head!
Do you trust me?
To death!
- I love you!
Me too!
Eva !
Eva !
Great mother!
Eva !
Do you really think
Eva will take care of your son?
What did she promise?
That she will change?
I don't want her to change.
I like her as she is, with character.
Get back!  Get back!
- Get back!
Get out!
Someday when you least expect it,
I'll rip your heart out .
We'll see about that.
Do you mind if I take my son?
He was born again in the Goddess.
Now he is ours.
Sergio, Sergio, tell her.
With whom do you want to be?
With your father or with these ladies?
With these ladies.
- Come on, I'm taking you home!
Manuel! Manuel!
Manuel, help me please!
Don't you dare touch him!
Dad !
Manuel, Manuel,
the rings, by God!
Manuel, help me!
Bloody hell!
The rings!
- Now is not the time, Tony! Behind you!
Let me go!
Mom?
- Sylvia, you're just the person I want to talk to.
Me too.
I'm going to sue you for this.
- You have every reason. I'm not a good father.
I'll give you a case that will make your head spin!
- Take it easy .
Yes, I brought my son to an armed robbery
And now he was eaten by a monster.
I agree this is not the best thing for a child.
What do you want me to say?
I needed to see him.
Help me, Manuel !
Your hands are burning!
- Of course they are!
We have to come to an understanding.
He needs both of us.
Let go of me, damn witch!
Your kingdom is gone, Mother.
The war is over.
What do you want? I'll give it!
You are not able... to meet... the needs...
of our... son!
Run! Run! Let's get out of here!
Daddy, Daddy, let's go!
Run!
Alfonso , what ...
what I said back there...
- Yes ?
Don't hold it against me.
Relax Jaime.
I liked it just fine.
Really?
ONE MONTH LATER
He's on next.
Maybe I should not have let him do this.
- but it doesn't hurt anybody.
Besides, you know what the psychologist said.
he can't stay inside all the time,
it could be counterproductive.
Whatever you say, my love.
Yes, you tell her to make the claim, and file it.
I'll take the counterclaim.  Tell her.
Pardon me,
these are not office hours.
this woman is very tired,
and needs some time for herself.
Well done!
This kid will be someone important,
I told you, Manuel .
A banker, right?
- Yes. it seems so.
Look, its "Gray Hair."
- Hey, should we go out tonight to see The Lion King?
Sounds good to me, I love musicals.
No, I'd rather to go to Disneyland.
I've never been there.
Fine, but we'll charter a plane, okay?
That's right, how could I forget,
We're millionaires.
Yes, we're millionaires.
I can not stand happy endings.
Then I get very emotional.
You are such a fool...
Look.  The happy family.
The have money, a car, a house, a dog,
a garden...
And all of that..
It will destroy them
little by little.
And when all that happiness suffocates them,
they will return to us.
