No, that's not it, stop!
Shit, I'm goin' to crack up!
You're never together, What are you doing !?
Estelle, it's you that's wrong
Go, music: 1, 2 ...
1, 2, 3, 4, there!
It's coming. That's it!
Stop the music.
Take a break, girls.
Out already?
I was released two months early for good conduct.
That surprises you, Danseur?
No.
That bothers you?
On the contrary.
It's nice, that.
I have a couple of questions to ask you.
I'm listening.
Where is Lola?
Lola?
Yes, Lola.
Eh, she left a while ago.
With whom?
I don't know
What's it to me?
With whom?
With a bloke
What bloke?
On my word, I don't know him
Where will I find them?
They often go to the Adrien, you know it?
Who squealed on me?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
You surely don't think..
.. that it's me?
Yes
So, he said to me:
.. "If you like me,
then you like them rough "
Hello, my dear.
You want to come uptairs with me? You can see the sea
Hey, you could answer!
You don't like my girlfriend?
Lola, do you have any matches?
Yes.
Pardon.
This is the place.
It will be there between 2 and 3 am
Everything ok?
Very good.
You're not alone?
Who is?
Mario.
Good!
Now, I'm off
We said F 5000, Mr. Boccace
Sure, I know
We were told ...
Half in advance, yes.
It's all in there
Fine.
I must dash.
So, 'til Monday.
'Til Monday, Mr. Boccace
Hello, Lola.
Hello
How are things ?
I'm fine, yes.
It's been paid for ?
Yes, yes.
Put on your hat,
get your bag and come.
Where are you going, Lola?
Me? Nowhere.
Well then put down your coat,
your bag, and go and sit down.
You heard what I told you?
So?
What are you doing, Lola?
Nothing, I ...
You're going somewhere?
It's Siffredi.
Hm.
Get rid of him.
Hey ...
Siffredi.
Roch.
Francois.
Capella.
I put in a few chives.
I know you like them
Ah yes, chives.
You've made it well
Lola has always liked to eat well.
That's rare among women.
And that's not the only thing she's likes
Yeah ...
She is someone of good taste,
.. discreet ...
Faithful.
Hm ...
Can I have a little sauce?
This is really good.
Delicious.
You forget how good it can be
That must change you.
Hm.
Say, how long were you in ?
Four months.
Why?
A lot of crap, it was my own fault
It makes you think, prison.
Now ...
Now?
I've more time to lose.
Someone's coming.
Oh!
Hi.
He's here?
Yeah. Where have you been?
We looked for you everywhere.
I've sprained my ankle.
I have weak ankles.
Especially when there's work.
Can I ask you an indiscreet question?
What kind?
That could earn you money?
I'd have to see.
How's that?
Ok ...
we'll do heads or tails.
Ok.
Choose.
Heads.
You've lost.
That's normal, I'm always lucky
What do I have to do?
Take Mario's place.
What's that? An accident?
Go and see, it's probably a drunk.
It wasn't difficult,
I told you so
What's in the back?
Have a look.
A horse?
It's a champion,
"Wonderful", you know?
No.
One of the favourites for
tomorrow's Grand Prix
The other is Rouge-Gorge,
which belongs to Boccace.
The drinks guy?
Exactly.
This gentleman would like to win, so, he removed Wonderful.
And you are going to bet on Red-Gorge.
With the money from Boccace
Hey, that's not bad
Oh no.
He's not going to make it
Who won?
Vanina 2.
You know who owns Vanina 2?
Sure, Boccace
No, it belongs to Rinaldi.
That wouldn't be your lawyer by chance?
Oh, the twisters
Hello Capella, how are you?
Sir?
Roch Siffredi.
My partner.
Well, sit down.
We don't have much time.
A cigar?
We're in a hurry.
I must congratulate you, it was perfect.
The two men you scared have recovered the truck, bravo!
I've worked out what I owe you: 2500 F.
Plus the 2500 I lost on Red-Gorge.
You bet Rouge-Gorge?
Not just me.
Capella, don't play the horses
Do I bet?
You should have won ..
.. the wad on Vanina 2?
Vanina 2 doesn't belong to me
I am pleased that my friend Maitre Rinaldi has won, but ...
Oh hold on, I'm going to be generous
I'll cover you for your losses, here's another 2500F.
Ok?
You'll have a glass?
A Boccace!
And my share?
How's that?
He's my partner.
I know.
So, you share.
I would never take a share from a friend.
Question of principle.
Hello, Roch.
In Italian:
No.
Go.
A punch
You've done a bit boxing, eh
A little.
That's good.
The one that you put down, this is my friend, Mario.
He has fragile ankles.
This is my cousin, Kid Maurice.
You know?
No.
That doesn't matter
We've been looking for a guy like you
What would you say to fighting him in the ring?
Really?
Not completely straight
But there has money to be made
and I'll take care of everything.
So you're called Hans Petrus
and you're champion of Bavaria.
From Bavaria?
Where is it?
It is ...
It's where, Bavaria?
In Germany?
I don't speak ..
.. German.
I am delighted to see you.
You know Kid Mauritius ..
.. and here's Hans Petrus, champion of Bavaria.
28 fights, 21 wins,
.. including 17 by way of knockout and 4 draws
Hans Petrus lives in Munich, and is married with 2 young daughters.
Please, Herr Petrus ...
Listen, we are in France, so speak french.
I asked the name ..
..of his two daughters.
Bertha and Marlene.
Ladies and gentlemen!
Here, you hold it.
On my right, Kid Mauritius.
Kid, start slowly.
There's Capella.
The judge for this fight ...
You're enjoying yourself, eh, ?
I told him to go hard for a round or so
Like that, they're going to get their money's worth
Petrus,he's only faking.
We haven't boobed
Get up!
Oh, Kid!
Oh, Kid!
One minute! Kid, hey!
No, I disagree.
So, that's it?
What were you doing??
You've messed up a great show.
He has been K -O'd
K.-O. ?
K.-O'd
Enter K..0
Good evening.
This is Capella and Siffredi.
Let me present Maitre Rinaldi.
We know each other a little.
Your little business is settled
The fire insurance ..
.. All taken care of, we won't talk anymore about it
Thank you.
Well, you can be proud of yourself
Well, you can be proud of yourself
Only,the gloves,you can hang them up, finished!
And you, you go back to the docks.
family!
I invited a few friends tonight, would you like to join us?
We'll celebrate the victory of Petrus.
Petrus?
My friend Simon Boccace
.. has just signed him up
It seems that it was you who discovered him, bravo.
Until tonight.
You want some?
Who's that?
It's Marello, with Poli
he run's Marseilles.
They're old school, but bigshots
Well established.
What's he doing at Rinaldi's?
Boccace without Rinaldi, is nothing.
And Rinaldi without Marello is no big thing
You have everything you want?
The big guy, that's Poli.
Good evening, pleased to see you, come.
Simon told me about a job you did for him.
Skilful,intelligent.
and well paid, it seems.
Reasonably
That's not the question, money is secondary.
Ah, you're here, come
These are the two young men ..
.. whom  I told you about
Gentlemen.
Madame.
M Escarguel controls 60% of the fish markets in Marseilles.
And he has a little problem which he would like to talk to you about.
My husband goes out very little.
And this is not the ideal place to talk about these things.
Could you come to the house one day this week?
Why not?
Excuse me, I'll leave you to it
Would 10 am Wednesday suit?
Yes.
Perfect.
Good evening, Madam.
Good evening.
Why did you wait in your car this afternoon?
I hate boxing.
I'm Siffredi.
Roch Siffredi, I know.
You've been in prison: breaking and entering.
You also spent two years in a battalion in Tunisia.
You do not have money ...
and you are looking for some
I am Mrs. Rinaldi, the wife of Maitre Rinaldi.
This is my place
I should know the people that I invite
at least that, no?
Your name?
Simone.
Your fragrance?
"God forbid."
They say that I put on too much perfume, but I'm afraid of smelling of fish.
Simone ...
Hello, I would like something expensive and beautiful.
For a woman of the world.
Roses.
The roses are nice?
Very nice.
I'll go for the roses.
Hm ...
Very well.
A dozen?
A dozen.
I'm Capella.
Funny name.
Why?
I don't know but it's funny.
I interest you?
I'd like to see you again.
Good idea.
You play tennis?
What's that?
Tennis.
Ah, tennis, yes.
I played a long time ago, I would have to get fit.
Would you rather go on a boat trip?
Ok, right away.
Ah, right away, I have an appointment
In 5 minutes.
Your bouquet, sir.
25 francs.
For your business appointment?
No, these are for you.
Hurry up!
See that, that's my car.
We could go to the Alcazar one night, or to the cinema.
I don't know if my father would agree.
What does your Father do?
He's in business too
I'm Ginette, bye.
I'll accompany you,
.. the streets of Marseille are not safe.
I don't mind, I have a car too
Really?
Tell me mate,  Madame Escarguel's office
At the top of the staircase.
We couldn't wait for you any longer.
Your friend is punctual and he brought me flowers.
Ah yes, eh I got a puncture
Let me introduce my husband.
Mr. Capella, my husband.
Sir.
My husband had an accident,
.. it is hard for him to speak and move,
.. but he he still has all his faculties
Being the only one to understand this I must take care of everything.
It's not really a life
Oh, and all those smells ...
I explained to your friend ...
M. Escarguel has two competitors, the Pradel brothers
They should be discouraged.
I see.
He wishes to supply all the fish markets.
That's very clear.
Yes, it is
You explain things better than me.
And ..
For this collaboration?
Well, I thought ...
10%.
This pleases my husband very much
Have you any idea?
An idea?
How you're going to proceed?
We'll think about it.
It's not so urgent.
As seeing you again
I would like very much to have you to dinner soon.
If you think of something in the weeks ahead
.. but above all, keep ... be...
Discreet.
My husband is very keen.
That this works, but ...
Discreet.
Come on, ladies, set to it !
Very well.
Go.
Say! this fish is not fresh!
Not fresh! ?
Smell it
Eh, it smells fine, it was caught last night.
Last night?
Yes.
Ladies,
Smell that for me.
What horror!
An infection.
An infection?
This fish is not fresh!
My fish is not fresh?
It's tail still moves, not like yours.
It is rotten.
It ain't fresh, no doubt about it!
I've seen you, you threw out your fish ..
.. from your basket, no buts this time!
So it's not fresh! ?
Hop it you.
But what's happening?
He says that it's not fresh.
It seems ok to me
Come on, ladies, let's go.
Oh, barmy!
Please.
The bathroom
Very good
The bedroom.
You have a phone?
Yes, sir.
In the bedroom and lounge.
Perfect.
The salon.
The salon, very nice
And tell me, for my friends?
Two small rooms, but on the same floor.
Perfect.
You put me on a canopy bed.
With columns.
Fine, sir.
Then some pictures with forests and naked women.
Certainly, sir.
There is a safe?
Of course.
What make?
A Durox, model 44-S.
44-S?
Well, put this in it
Right sir.
Oh!
My respects,
Ms. Escarguel ..!
They are charming.
Yes.
Go, go!
Oh, my hat!
Go!
Go!
Slowly, guys!
Listen!
Head there
Ah good, let's go across there
Ah!
It's amazing.
Huh? That feels good.
Ah yes.
wait, it's deeper here
I'm going to change in the rocks.
I'll leave you my umbrella, I'll come back.
I always want to talk to you, but we never have the time.
You're right.
You could make a killing like the one with the fish,
.. but bigger.
Explain.
Poli.
What, Poli?
The butcher's shop
That doesn't interest me, the butcher's shop
Why?
I like ..
.. butchers.
You can have it, Poli.
He is like Marello, finished.
A little push and he will fall
No, I'm not interested.
Let me at least explain it to you.
Huh?
I'm going to do heads or tails.
Tails.
You lost.
Don't play with me
Your friend seems angry.
Is it because of me?
No.
Who is the young girl?
I would like to get to know her.
She's Poli's latest, Ginette.
What?
Poli's new girl.
It seem's he's crazy about her.
You're sure?
As much as one can be
Where you going?
I'm going to say hello to them
Where is the basket?
There.
I'm taking off my jacket.
I'll open the rosé
I'm going to set the table.
There.
I've marked my jacket.
Here are the tomatoes.
There.
The other plates.
Hello.
Hello.
Hi, Capella.
Hi.
Hi.
You know each other?
More or less.
Want a pastis?
No.
Your father's not here?
He couldn't come.
Business, you know what it's like.
I was going to suggest a little boat trip
That would be a good idea, one of these days
Why not right now?
Huh?
I'll follow you
You think maybe it is dangerous for him
Women are dangerous
This is nice.it's beautiful
You often go sailing?
Attention.
That's it.
Ah, they've left us behind
Yes.
What will your father say?
No more bets
Banco, anyone
No.
No.
To the bank.
Banco.
Place your bets.
How are you?
Well, and you?
A friend.
Good evening, Miss
Got a place?
At the main table.
Follow me.
Baccara, there.
Francis is there, he's waiting for you
Excuse me.
I didn't want to return to the hotel like this
I came here.
You've done well. What's been happening?
I can stay?
For as long as you want.
Rest yourself.
Roch.
I wanted to tell you ...
About the butcher shop, it's ok
Pff!
The butcher ...
What's this idea you wanted to talk about?
I'd would rather have not heard anything
The butcher shop...
The butcher shop...
Have you lost your head or something?
You know who runs the butcher shop?
Poli.
And so?
You know him?
You know what he is capable of ?
That doesn't scare you?
No.
So listen to me.
You've made your place in the sun, very good.
You've got some nerve, Capella and you, you're not blunderers,
.. Bravo.
We left you to enjoy yourself with the brother-in-law's fish.
He is very tired.
Then my sister insisted.
But don't go rubbing up against the real bosses.
Do you understand?
I don't see why you're taking Poli's side
You are rather tied to Marello, No?
I'm not tied to anyone
I'm his lawyer, that's all
And I'm going to tell you,
.. Poli and Marello have run this city
for four years.
No friction, no setbacks.
It works.
Don't go meddling in it.
I was 7 years old when I ate meat for the first time.
François, don't go there, they're waiting for you!
François?
François!
François!
Everyone out!
All right?
Yes, I'm all right.
Oh, take that.
Ok.
Damn, a flat !
Lets go, quick!
You won't make it
You see we did
Francis, head for my Mother's
Gunfire.
Tell me, Francis.
You haven't spoken about it ..
To Ginette ..?
Go to the hotel.
But ...
Do what I say
Ginette was coming tonight.
Ah, you're expected.
This way.
You still think about Ginette ?
Was it serious?
You would have left with her?
What do you mean left?
I don't know, leave, go somewhere else
With her? Maybe.
Mario, we weren't able to go his funeral, it's sad.
Say,are we going to stay here for a long  ?
--However long it takes.
I don't mind, I love the countryside.
Looks like the Fada is coming.
They've come from Beziers, they're looking for a hideout.
For?
A stickup
Any trouble?
A little.
Look after them.
All went well?
Fine.
Here are the newspapers.
-Let's see.
And the rest?
It's there.
Ah, help me.
No, leave
Hey!
Ah, they're not new, they come from Morocco.
But they've been verified.
This is what you wanted?
Exactly.
You have them...
In the other case
Good,show me.
Tell me, has master Rinaldi been appointed deputy Mayor ?
He didn't lose this time
He has nothing on us?
Poli thinks you're out of circulation
Good, we'll let him go on believing that
Hello?
Who?
At Poli's?
Now? But listen ...
Good.
Well, I'll get on.
Ok, I'm coming
You wait for me, are you coming or will we meet up at the theater?
I'm come with you.
We shouldn't be long.
It rings.
What's this?
What's happening?
Good evening, maitre.
We learned of your appointment.
We wanted to congratulate you, bravo.
Where were you going?
To the theatre.
To see what?
"L'Aiglon."
You look surprised, Maitre
To see you here? Yes, a little.
Like us, this evening at the slaughterhouse
We were surprised to see that they were waiting for us
I had warned you, but don't infer from...
You'll be late for the theatre.
It may have even finished.
What do you think?
We've thought a lot about you.
But you can be useful to us
Yes, we intend to buy this place
You want to buy?
Yes.
But where is Poli?
He died,
.. at the restaurant.
A quarter of an hour?
Twenty minutes.
Dead?
Whether the angels ..
.. lead you to paradise.
That martyrs
welcome you on your arrival.
That the angels receive you, that you enjoy eternal rest ..
.. with the one who was once the poor Lazarus.
Amen.
Mr. Marello ..
.. would like to talk to you.
About what, Danseur?
It's simple: you take over from Poli.
But Poli never touched what belongs to Mr. Marello ..
.. and you will not touch it
So?
I warn you.
You took Poli by surprise, I am a naturally suspicious.
Very suspicious.
And Rinaldi is my friend.
If you touch him, you touch me too.
Why would we hit him?
Moreover, Maitre Rinaldi isn't looking after your business anymore
I don't like being spoken to in that tone, Danseur.
Chauffeur.
Obviously, Mr. Poli had his accounts in there
In love as in business, some things are not written down.
Of course.
Mr. Poli had interests all over Marseilles.
Of course, there are hotels, restaurants,
.. the downside of drinking.
You are invaluable, M. Martial.
Always by the percentage system
You know, I have been in business a long time
I started in '94 with the Valabres brothers.
You are too young to know them
Tell me ...
It comes straight from Chicago.
Good, put it there.
250 like that,it's going to be mad
Go! To yours.
Ouch!
Well, Lola, the disc.
You like that?
It's opulent.
Designed by Leleu.
Because
Now, you ...
Wait, look at that.
A beautiful Guyot bronze
Chinese, very rare color: beef blood
Coromandel, 18th century
Come see.
Hi, Maurice
Hi, Roch.
Lydia hi, how's it going?
Leave us.
How's it going.
All's well with the business?
There's a future in business.
There's a future in everything.
How could one not pay tribute to the success of
The new ..municipality?
When we see our beautiful city Marseille.
A gateway to the East ..
each day ..
more modern, prosperous.
And happier.
It is therefore with deep conviction that I say to you:
.. next month by voting for me,
.. you vote for progress.
For justice.
And for peace.
We don't see you much at the Casino.
You've become such a busy man
And Marseille owes you a lot.
Answer me frankly, my husband has done something to you
Tell me what.
Please I need to know.
He had talked about your projects to Poli, is that it?
Don't ask these kind of questions
It's funny, whenever I meet you,
.. you never seem satisfied
Should I be?
You have all that you want.
You think so?
You don't like these elections much?
Rinaldi MP, Marello behind ...
It would lack
.. more than that.
What can be done?
No.
Not during the election that would be awkward.
Ah!
What a set, eh?
Come on, let's have another one
Here, roughly, these are the expenses
The salaries, management fees, good works ...
Good works?
Yes, orphanages, asylums.
Tradition calls for it
Taxation is overwhelming today.
The police are here.
--So?
An inspector's asking for you
An inspector?
Yeah.
M. Capella?
Yes.
Inspector Teissère.
Please follow me to the police station.
--Ok
Inform Maitre Rinaldi.
That won't be easy.
Why?
Because he has two bullets in his body.
He's in hospital in a serious condition.
This way.
Let's go
Monsieur the Commissioner.
Sit down, Mr. Capella.
As long as things are kept between yourselves,
.. we do not get involved
When wolves devour each other it is the shepherd's business
Master Rinaldi is the deputy Mayor of Marseilles,
.. even our future MP so we intervene.
I was at my office all day.
I have witnesses.
Of course, you've a watertight alibi.
I've haven't even asked you, I was sure of it.
All the same I'm going to ask you the usual questions
But beware, do not go too far.
Who shot him?
That would be an interesting question if you were asking it..
to Mr. .. Siffredi.
So?
Nothing special, they were released, of course.
But there is a little friction between the two.
How's that?
Siffredi perhaps made his move without informing Capella
Possibly.
Are you waiting for them to break once and for all?
You warned them not to touch Rinaldi ..
.. and they have
It beginning to be said that they scare you
Listen, Danseur,
.. Let people talk
They're just small cons, there's nothing to lose by waiting
You know that?
Firing on Rinaldi and missing him
.. they made a Member of Parliament of him
You understand ?
It's me who came up with this headline
With two bullets in the body, he is sure to be elected.
It was agreed we shouldn't touch Rinaldi
Especially before the election.
I haven't touched Rinaldi.
Someone's trying to cause trouble
I know.
Not Marello himself.
No?
I don't see..
.. his interest.
I don't agree with you.
He stands in your light.
What are you saying?
He bothers you.
Everyone bothers you.
I'm telling you it's not me!
Do you want something else?
Nothing more.
It's not often that I have the opportunity to see you.
Come on, Tchin.
Go.
How's Roch?
Always the same.
Hey, play for me.
I really like this place.
Do you remember the boat,
the evening ..when you brought Roch back?
You've come a long way since then
I still like to cook for you
A woman sings.
I don't like my memories
I spend my whole life lying
If you leave,it is a little death
Long live the great sea and boats
Take me, Sailor
La, la, la, la ...
Since I was 20 years old
I 've had lovers
Who passed by Marseille
The time of night
I do not have much to offer you
It is four francs for a sigh
And if you want to please me
Don't forget, dear, your little present
Take me, sailor
Listen, Rinaldi has been had, for good this time.
At the hospital?
Yes, stabbed
Who did it ?
We don't know
Where is Roch?
We have to find him
Come on, come with me.
Roch?
Roch?
Where's Roch?
I don't know.
But someone's waiting for him
I wanted to see Mr. Siffredi.
It is about the death of my husband.
I know who killed him.
Where is the boss?
In his office.
Yes?
Ah, François?
He's here, you want to talk to him?
Someone's trying to start trouble between us and Marello
Why?
So they can take our place.
A bastard shot down Rinaldi..
.. To make Marello think it was us
I knew that.
Someone recognized you
At the hospital.

You're quite right.
What do you want?
You're wrong about Rinaldi.
Possibly.
No, that's for sure.
It's Danseur who shot him
To put us against each other ..
.. and profit from it
Capella knew this and did what he had to do.
You had no reason to call it.
You knew that.
I know what I had to do.
But you're wrong.
And so?
It is a mistake which is hard to forget
You're getting old, Marello.
There are things which escape you
And it is serious.
You should stand down
Is this what you came to tell me?
You shouldn't have bothered
I wanted to tell you.
Hear me well.
I know what I'm risking
You could shoot me down now easily.
You haven't had it for a while, Marello.
I wanted to tell you to your face
5 to the second.
Gentlemen, no more plays
Place your bets.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
Games marked.
No more bets
Gentlemen, no more bets
Card to the first,
Card to the second
Card to the second, 9 to the bank.
6 to the first, 3 to the second.
3 everywhere.
Gentlemen, place your bets.
Ah!
Come on, down the bottom, let's go!
I hope this time, he understood.
Don't worry, he understood.
Obviously, you have an alibi, you were here
I suppose you've had your wallet stolen?
You should complain.
I did.
Try to find them.
In mine, there were photos of my mother.
You didn''t recognise the men who did this?
No.
No.
And the death of Marello,
.. no tips?
None.
He must have slipped and fallen..
.. on his paper-cutter
That seems very strange
Surely.
This face mean anything to you ?
No.
Yes, but I don't know his name.
He was called Danseur.
Ms. Rinaldi has identified him as her husband's killer
As he is also dead another case is closed.
You are the little kings of Marseilles.
There is nobody else
.. in front of you.
It's the time to be very careful
We have a new mayor. A nice business
Capella and Siffredi support him, it may be good for us.
You think so
His face tells me something.
Charming, this soirée.
Thank you.
Good evening.
Roch.
Hm?
Things going the way you want it?
Fine
And you?
What do you have?
Nothing.
I'm off
You've time.
Not so much
I have a train to catch
What?
In one hour.
Where are you going?
To Nice.
From there, I'm going to Italy.
You're going alone?
No, I'm taking Lola.
You're going?
I told you.
For long ?
Perhaps.
I'm going to the hotel to get my luggage.
Francois
Why are you going?
Because we are two
I don't understand
It's simple.
First we had Poli
.. then Dancer, then Marello.
There is no reason for it to stop.
One day or another, there will be only one of us
It's better that I go now
It will finish by bringing us down
Maybe I will start it
It's the way things are, we can't help it.
And you know it
And what if I left ?
Instead of you
You would do it?
Immediately.
I'll play you for it
If you lose, you go
Agreed?
Agreed
What's your call?
Heads.
This time, you've won, Roch.
You knew it ?
A coin in each pocket.
Before that used to amuse me.
But not tonight.
Bye, Roch.
Chance, it doesn't exist.
François!
Hey, Roch ...
Roch ...
Chance ...
You see, it doesn't exist.
