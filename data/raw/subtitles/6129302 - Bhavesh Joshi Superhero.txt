'Before the setting sun'
'his dark silhouette stood'
'looking over the city.'
'The wind ruffled his hair.'
'This city was once his..'
'The city he was born in.'
Krrish..
'The city he was born in,
grew up in.. One that he loved.'
'That city was now a nightmare.'
Pal..
What does 'dark silhouette' mean?
First let me tell the story,
then you may ask what it meant.
But it won't make sense
if we don't understand it.
Publish a Hindi
dictionary along with this
then I'll understand it.
I'll publish one after you hear
it, then you won't even need it.
How will I understand it if
you use such complicated words?
I won't understand it.
So then..
But what is this?
It's a graphic novel.
Mumbai's first super-hero.
What are you saying?
Wasn't that Ra-One?
No, it was G-One.
That was Ra-One.
The movie was Ra-One.
But G-One was the hero.
Ra-One was the villain.
Then why was the movie
called Ra-One?
How does it matter
Ra-One, G-one, anyone?
I spent my life writing this
and you won't even listen to it.
Sorry..
- You're on some other tangent.
Okay.. Read.
Don't feel bad. Go on.
'Corruption had eaten into
the city like a pest.'
'Every policeman was in
the gangster's pocket.'
'Every minister was
doing his bidding.'
And the superhero and the
gangster's daughter were fiddling.
'I met Bhavesh and Siku in 2011.'
'There was hope everywhere.'
'It was like the entire country
was standing against corruption.'
'People were preparing
for a new era.'
Why have you come to this protest?
Look, we think corruption is shit.
Yes. And shit stinks.
Shit stinks!
That's it?
'In this chaos, these two clowns
just wanted to get arrested.'
Sir, please..
Sir, please..
I told you..
Sir, I swear on Gandhi..
I swear on Gandhi. Sir, please.
I said no.
It must end..
Docu!
This guy hasn't done anything.
Hey, shoot a video of us!
Can you call the cops?
Can you call the cops please?
I don't want to go to jail.
Don't cry just yell,
'I praise thee Mother!'
"Come on.
Live your life."
"Live your life.."
We shall overcome..
We shall overcome.. Louder!
I do believe..
We shall overcome..
'The police got a kick
from Bhavesh and Siku.'
'Even I had never imagined'
'that being in a lock-up
can be so much fun.'
All praise Lord Ganesha!
Sachin! Sachin!
- 'Truth be told..'
'It was the best day of my life.'
Sachin! Sachin!
Hey, Docu!
What's up?
Rajat.
- Bhavesh.
Siku. - 'Perhaps Bhavesh
and Siku saw it'
'and that's why they
took me in after that day.'
Corruption..
- Must go..
'Back then, a lot of middle class
messiahs with brooms appeared.'
'But Bhavesh and Siku believed'
'that the movement didn't
need a messiah with a broom.'
We pledge..
'They believed'
'that the ones who spread dirt
should clean it.'
People will post photos of
their marked fingers on Facebook
but after that no one
will lift a finger, man.
Not one freaking finger.
I've seen people raise their
fingers to point at others.
His fault, his responsibility,
the government's failure.
They won't walk to the trash can
to throw their trash.
But when it comes
to waste management
they'll be the first to write
a disquisition on social media.
Disquisition? Bro, nobody
uses words like that anymore.
Why?
- Joshi
the country is making progress,
what are you doing?
'Progress!'
- What are you doing?
India's population is the highest.
But pal, what are we doing?
Meaning?
Meaning we're just getting
drunk and then complaining.
Right?
So we should do something.
But what?
And when?
I have an idea..
Hey, mister!
Why are you cutting this tree?
Pal, leave now. Let me work.
Cutting trees is illegal!
- Illegal!
I have permission from the law
the municipal corporation,
and everyone else, understood?
Get lost.
- To hell with your permission.
The tree has feelings.
Did you ask the tree?
Did you?
Just cut it.
Hey!
I said cut.
- Stop!
I said cut!
Shit! Behind you! Look!
Run, Siku..
- Hey.. Stop..
Run.. Siku, run!
Stop!
Insaaf!
- Insaaf!
We are Insaaf..
We are Insaaf..
We are Insaaf..
We are the revolution..
We've been trying to save
these trees for so many years.
But no one was listening,
no one was interested..
You guys saved our trees
thanks a lot.
Listen carefully.
From now on,
this society should have
no internet problems. Understood?
Hey? You're threatening me?
- Catch him!
Look.. Siku, show him.
Look at this photo.
How did you get this?
Thank you, Insaafers, for
solving our internet problems.
Thank you, ma'am..
Insaaf!
Thank you, Mr. Arif,
and thank you.
@shruti @priyanka
@farhan and Mrs. Sharma.
Who thought of us when they
had nowhere else to turn to.
Please don't thank us.
It's our duty.
Awesome. Cut?
- Got that, pal.
Sure?
'These crusaders were
becoming a rage.'
'Bhavesh played
the masked crusader.'
'And Siku handled the backend
with his technical knowledge.'
Joshi.
Joshi, wake up.
What are you doing?
- Check this out.
'Whenever or wherever
injustice rears its head'
'and Insaaf is summoned'
'Insaaf will be there to fight it'
'and we will risk our
lives to deliver justice.'
'Insaaf Punch!'
Too good, my friend.
'Brothers, sisters, uncles,
aunties and children, remember..'
'If someone wrongs you'
'or anyone around you'
'just hit us up on
Twitter @theinsaaf'
'or use Facebook, Orkut,
Skype, Tumblr, LinkedIn'
'MySpace, Pinterest,
iMessage or WhatsApp'
'and remember.'
'We don't use Google Plus.'
'No Google Plus.'
Oh my God! This is so cool.
We're basically like the
Indian Justice League.
So, you are like Spiderman.
No.. That's Marvel.
We're DC.
We're cooler, we're darker,
we're edgier.
So how did you start doing this?
You know,
I used to be like everyone else
but there comes a time
when you must heed a certain call
when the world must
come together as one.
Because there are people dying
you see, and
sometimes you need to
lend a hand to life.
"The greatest gift of all!"
"We are the world.."
Michael Jackson..
Do you really think
that by singing Michael
Jackson's lyrics on YouTube
you can sweet-talk any girl?
How are you this small-minded?
We are a movement, okay?
Oh really?
Yes. It's a movement.
Yes. I totally get it.
It's such a noble cause.
She totally gets it.
It's a noble cause.
There are some people who
care for their country
their city
and their people.
So will you please get off your
high horse and stop judging people?
Hey! Stop the car! Stop the car.
Stop now.
What happened?
- Reverse.
But what happened?
- Reverse the car now.
But tell me.. - Reverse it now,
you jumped the signal!
Yes.
- What?
He jumped the signal? - The rascal
jumped the signal, now reverse!
How did I jump the signal, man?
It's empty..
Reverse..
- It's 12 in the night..
It's 12 a.m. and it's raining,
so will you jump the signal?
There are no cops..
So will you jump the signal?
I'll take you straight
to the police station.
What is this..
Get it out of my face.
Straight to the station..
Reverse the car.
Just for this?
Come on, now reverse.
Reverse the car.
- I'm reversing..
I'm reversing the car, sir..
What happened?
What do you mean what happened?
The signal is there for a reason
it's not an exhibit.
Darn! Oh my..
Green.
Now you may go.
I know.
Is this your father's property
to pee on?
Sorry..
Darn the sorry..
Hey..
I'm done..
You can't burn waste!
You can't burn waste!
Insaaf!
Run..
Why aren't you in school?
You're entering a 'No Entry' lane.
Get lost.
Asshole..
Why are we learning karate, pal?
We'll have to, pal.
Otherwise morons like that guy
can't be stopped.
Next time, we'll karate chop him.
You're right.
But do we have to wear
a robe to learn karate?
That's how you feel it.
Okay. Insaaf punch.
On the floor. Right now.
Left, right..
Good..
He's treating us like animals, pal.
Pal..
Even Bruce Lee couldn't
have done this.
You two!
Keep quiet.
Move forward.
Yes, sir.
- Go!
Bhavesh. Bhavesh..
He'll run over you, pal!
Are you insane?
Hey, French Beard.
Go back. It's a one-way.
Siku, I think he's scared.
He's going away without his car.
Why's he reaching into the boot?
Oh shit.
Hey..
- Two shit.
Put your stick back, bastard..
Siku!
Sorry, man.
For what?
Only you got beaten up
and I couldn't even do anything.
What are you saying, man?
Either one of us gets beaten up,
it's the same, right?
We're in this together, man.
We'll win, get beaten, together.
Tell me something.
You like re-arranging
your body parts for fun?
For how long will you continue
this drama?
It's not a drama.
It's the wave of change.
We'll change the country
surfing this wave.
Both of you need to
understand one thing.
You aren't changing anything
through Facebook and Twitter.
You're advertising your stupidity.
And you'll die.
You'll go down.
How are we going to
change the country?
With small steps.
Today it's us
tomorrow it'll be thousands.
We just have to promise each other
that we'll never leave Insaaf.
Insaaf Punch.
- Insaaf Punch.
'Today,
silence has befallen the cities'
'that were torn by
nation-wide protests.'
'Mumbai's empty MMRDA ground'
'mirrors the Jan Lokpal bill's
failure.'
'The government has silenced
the cries against corruption.'
'This marks the tragic end
of the Jan Lokpal movement.'
'When reality hits a man,
he changes.'
'Something like that
happened to Siku.'
'After that day, the fight against
the system seemed pointless.'
'Dreams of the Insaaf Show
and a changed country..'
'Appeared to be shallow.'
'The city grew. Five years passed.'
'Bhavesh still believed'
'that things are
not beyond repair.'
'But Siku..
Siku had fully given up.'
'After getting
an engineering degree'
'he became a corporate slave
just like millions of others.'
'He spent eight hours
a day coding for an MNC.'
'And then a call came
that changed everything.'
Sir.
The company wants to open
an office in the US.
And to work on the setup there,
they want
someone from here.
Will you go?
Where in the US?
Atlanta.
They want me to lead the
development team there.
You're seriously going?
What about Insaaf?
You'll look after it.
It's a serious question, man.
And I'm seriously telling you,
Bhavesh, you're here.
What have we changed in the last
five years with Insaaf?
What are you talking about?
We..
Mr. Arif.. We took care of him.
And after that every
cable and internet
operator has been straightened out,
right, Bhavesh?
Things don't change overnight.
They take time.
Everything takes time.
Bhavesh, people don't care
about their own lives.
Why are we wasting ours? Man..
On all railway platforms in Mumbai,
there's an announcement blaring
'Do not cross the tracks'.
Do people listen? No.
They cross the tracks to save
one minute, then get knocked down
and then? Then what?
- Stop..
What happened?
- Stop the car.
But what happened?
- Reverse.
Reverse. You jumped the signal.
I'm trying to say something,
Bhavesh.
You're trying to say something
so will you jump a signal? Reverse.
Reverse.
- First listen.
Reverse!
- No, I won't.
Just stop the car, man!
You're showing me this?
Relax, guys..
- You're showing me this.
You're going to America so
you'll jump the signal?
You'll show me..
- Reverse!
Reverse!
- Siku.
'But Bhavesh..'
'Remained Bhavesh.'
'Mumbai's keeper.'
'Malad's famous Insaaf Man.'
Hello?
This is Insaaf.
Your application is
at the small station.
You'll have to clear it there.
But, sir, the policemen came home
two weeks ago and verified it.
But it hasn't come here.
Sir, if you could just
read this message.
It says 'Passport
Application under process'.
This came three weeks ago.
That's fine.
But it hasn't come here.
So what do I do now?
Talk to them.
- The passport office?
No, pal.
At the small station.
In your area.
Our guy came to your house.
- You weren't home.
Sir, I was at home. I spoke to him.
See what's written.
Your door was locked.
You weren't home.
Bring your original documents
and submit them again.
Sir, I was at home.
I offered him water.
Giving water to your
guest is your duty.
Sir, that's right
but if I wasn't home how
could I have given him water?
Cold water?
Yes, cold water.
You have a refrigerator at home?
Yes, I do.
Which brand?
The signal is red, are you blind?
Why don't you just bribe
them and get it over with?
You'll have your
passport in no time.
Are you saying this?
- Yes. For your sake.
Sneha, I can't give a bribe.
I never have.
And if I give one now, Bhavesh
won't let me inside the house.
Then don't go to Atlanta.
Stay here with me.
You always talked about change.
About fixing things
and going on a world tour.
I'm not happy here, Sneha.
The time to change
the world is over.
Come with me to Atlanta.
Be serious, Siku.
I am being serious.
What will I do there?
I have my internship here.
Your internship will
be over in six months.
You can study there.
You'll study, I'll work.
We'll buy a house
with a white fence outside.
Driveway, backyard..
Even an outdoor garage.
With a convertible in it.
We'll take it on long
drives on the weekends.
We'll get married.
In an American style.
I do. I do.
You do?
Are you proposing?
Thank you.
Why don't you take it off, dear?
I can't take that risk.
Dear, I don't know to what
extent you can help me.
I've already complained
approached some journalists.
But no one can see
the crisis in this.
At least tell me.
There's a water crisis everywhere.
It gets worse in the summer.
But in our area, in our colony
no matter what the season
water crisis has been
worsening for the last two years.
The BMC promised us
water supply twice a day.
But it comes once a week.
And randomly.
I tried talking to
the ward officer.
He said he had too much
to deal with already.
He would put it off
saying that he was busy.
He finally met me
when I filed an RTI appeal.
He said, 'It hasn't rained
in Latur for six months'
'and you're complaining? Latur
hasn't had rain for six months.'
'You want to complain?'
When did I tell you to submit this?
Sir.
I've been asking you since..
- Excuse me, sir.
Sir, according to the
official announcement
there should be water supply
four times a day?
Ward 6 gets water for
only a few hours every week.
Who are you?
How did you get inside?
Sir, I even made a complaint, but..
What is that? Are you shooting?
No.
- Tawade!
How are people supposed
to live without water?
How did he get in, Tawade?
- Why aren't you answering me?
Are you sleeping?
You aren't.. - Sir..
Get him out. He's shooting. Out!
- What happened to those 4 hours?
Out. - Answer me.
It's a simple question.
There's no point talking to him.
Don't waste your time.
What are you staring at?
It's for your own good.
Complaining here won't help.
They've sucked out all the water.
How will it come to you?
What does that mean?
Even the higher
officers are involved.
It starts here.
It's a scam.
The city's water suppliers
have dissected
the main pipelines into illegal
pipes and mini pumps.
First, they cut the BMC water
supply and create a crisis.
Then the water
that's for the people
is stolen and sold to them at
exorbitant prices. Openly.
'Their business is thriving because
no one is questioning them.'
'But now, we're here.'
'We're asking questions
and they must give us answers.'
He said, 'It hasn't rained
in Latur for six months'.
'And you're complaining? Latur
hasn't had rain for six months.'
Yes, sir.
- 'Did you see the video?'
Yes, sir.
I saw it.
'Want to spend your life in the
dance bar or have you woken up?'
'What?'
- Yes, sir.
'Find out who the old man is.'
Okay.
Ikandar Khanna?
Sikandar Khanna, sir.
That's what it says here. See.
Actually, sir..
The roof was leaking
because of the rain.
Look, with this document your
passport will read Ikandar Khanna.
But, sir
it's just a little water.
It's the same document.
The name is clear.
Sikandar Khanna.
It's an original document.
I've submitted
it before and you've checked it.
You'll need new documents.
These are the originals.
They won't do.
Sir, I submitted these
documents a month ago
and they were approved.
The same ones.
That's what you're saying.
Is it written here?
Because everything
on this is a lie.
They came home,
did the verification, everything.
Just tell me what
you want from me.
What's going on?
He's scaring me, sir.
He's trying to make me approve
these for his passport clearance.
But the ink has spread.
No..
Sir, there was a leak in my roof.
A drop of water fell on
it but the name is clear..
Stop shouting.
How can we pass these?
- Exactly. - They won't do.
But why, sir? I submitted the
same documents a month ago.
They have it on record.
Apply for them again
and submit them again.
If you leave original
documents lying around
who will face the consequences?
You or the police?
Sir, you aren't listening..
- No, you aren't listening.
Go.
Get him out.
The corporator's inside,
send him tea.
Okay. Go on, get out.
Kamble, get some tea.
Sir!
Sir!
Sikandar.
Is your passport done?
No.
What?
Then hurry it up.
I can't wait.
Get it done or I'll have
to send someone else.
Good.
You'll get your passport.
You went through so much
when you had
the original documents.
You could have saved time.
Sir! Sir!
Sir!
Are you okay?
Careful. Careful.
Careful. Get up.
I am responsible for all this.
Not at all, dear.
You did the right thing.
You did something that was
everyone's duty.
My son is coming next week.
He'll take me with him.
The rest is up to you, dear.
Just be careful.
They were asking about you.
I said nothing.
I said nothing.
Is your passport sorted?
You bribed them?
Answer me. Did you bribe them?
What else could I do?
What else could you do?
Seriously?
You could have made a complaint.
Lodged an FIR, you could have
contacted the anti-corruption
people, you..
Shut up, Bhavesh.
- You could have fought.
Don't lecture me. It's done.
I'm lecturing you?
What about those slogans, Siku?
'Never bribe, nor be bribed.'
What about that?
Was it just for the sake of it?
You're disgusting, man.
What happened?
What happened? He bribed
the Police for his passport.
I'm the one who had
to wait there in a queue.
I'm the one who'd get insulted.
I'm the one who
went through so much
just to be humiliated
in front of everyone.
Do you know how that feels?
You don't.
I don't know?
- No.
Your head's in the clouds.
You don't know what's
happening in the outside world.
Don't make lame excuses because
you don't want to fight the system
or the police, don't
put it on me. Okay?
Do you know what's happening
in the outside world?
Do you know what happened
at this police-station?
They beat an old man
because he had the guts to come
on Insaaf and speak the truth.
Do you remember Insaaf?
Our show, your show which
you used to be a part of.
Have you forgotten?
- Sit down.
How can I sit when
he's talking nonsense?
What happened?
Who got beaten? - Barve, man.
They beat him at the police-station
because
he spoke about the water scam.
All of them,
even the local corporator..
All the villains of
the city have united.
They had an itch.
So they got up to something.
They stole water.
They've wasted everyone else
so they went for an old man.
That same world famous old man
who starred in world famous Bhavesh
Joshi's world famous Insaaf show.
Just let it go.
- What will you do now?
You'll fight everyone?
You'll stop everyone?
Here, speak.
- What's he doing?
How will you stop them?
Speak.
- Siku, stop this please.
Please just shut up.
- Speak up, Insaaf man.
Put it down please. Stop.
I thought you were Insaaf man!
You'll deliver justice?
- Have you lost it?
What are you doing?
Want to be a hero? - Bhavesh!
- Psycho.
Tell us your next move.
Are you done preaching?
I'm not preaching,
I'm going to do something.
I'll show them,
I'll break all of them.
I'll break the corporator who beat
Barve. I'll break the policeman.
Every corrupt minister in this
country should be broken.
What's the point of living here?
Run away to America.
The country is crumbling anyway.
Does anyone make a difference?
No one.
All of them are cowards like you.
Siku, do you know the
difference between you and me?
I love this country
and I can't watch it suffer.
So I'm going to stay
here and change it.
Insaaf has made you crazy.
Everything is a conspiracy to you.
But I'm not running away. I'm
standing my ground and fighting.
What are you fighting?
Insaaf has gotten
400 views in 5 years
half of which are mine
and Rajat's, ask him.
Do you seriously think
it's all about views?
Why else are you doing this?
Because I can't sit and watch like
the rest. My fight will continue.
Understood?
- Do you have to shout..
Hiding behind a mask,
and making videos of yourself..
Die, corruption, die!
Grow up, Bhavesh Joshi.
You're not a superhero.
You're an unemployed loser
from Malad. - Siku!
Are you mad? What are you doing?
Just go, please.
Please leave.
Siku..
I am.. Really sorry..
You think this is funny?
No.. It's not funny.
It's not supposed to be.
But it's a big.. Hey.. Listen..
Hang on.. Listen..
I hit you really hard. Hey, Siku..
Sorry.
Siku..
Siku.. Sorry, pal.
I didn't know my
punch was so hard.
Sometimes the Insaaf Punch
gets hard.
Open the door. Siku..
Come on, man.. 'What will you do?
I'll break everyone.'
'I'll break the corporator
who hit Barve.'
'I'll break the cop..'
Open the door. Pal..
Bhavesh Joshi..
- Down, down..
Bhavesh Joshi..
- Down, down..
'We are standing outside a middle
income society where Bhavesh Joshi'
'who uploaded a video
slandering the police, lives.'
'Mr. Subodh is here with us.
Let us know why he's here'
'and who actually
is Bhavesh Joshi.'
'Mr. Subodh..
- It's the era of social media.'
'The government makes the best
use of social media'
'and takes its schemes and
services to the people.'
'Whereas anti-national
people like Bhavesh Joshi'
'use it to tarnish the image
of the people, police'
'and the nation.'
'Such people who have links with
Pakistan must be taught a lesson.'
'We won't tolerate it anymore.'
'This is the consequence..'
- One moment.
'As you can see, the crowd
is shouting pro-India slogans'
'in this locality in Malad..'
Hail Mother India..
- Hail..
'He was dragged out of his house.'
'The same Bhavesh Joshi who had
uploaded the controversial video'
'in which he was
bad-mouthing India.'
'Yes..'
- Enough.
'The public's fury..'
Come on, now.
Bhavesh Joshi..
- Down, down..
Bhavesh Joshi..
- Down, down..
Bhavesh Joshi..
- Down, down.. - Move..
Move it..
- Move..
Bhavesh Joshi.
Your game is up.
Wearing a mask
playing the phantom..
It's all over.
If you ever utter a word
against me or the police
if I ever see you
within a kilometre's radius
I'll shoot the next video with you.
In the ISIS style.
Bhavesh, stop this now please.
Is your passport sorted?
Congratulations.
Come on.
- Where to?
Come on.
- But where..
You'd clown around with him
wearing that mask, right?
Would you not?
Would you or would you not?
Leave this place as
soon as possible.
Take my advice. Stay in America.
It's good for you.
There are no problems out there.
Everything is top notch.
Because if you team up with your
friend and try some funny tricks..
We know everything about you.
Your residence,
the people you meet..
We know about your.. Girlfriend.
Got it?
I've thrown my mask away.
Because I don't need it anymore.
My name is Bhavesh Joshi.
Now you know the consequences
of coming out with the truth.
Our fight for justice will
continue. I will continue.
They are stealing our
water and selling it
back to us. This is the truth.
Calling me an anti-national
won't change the facts.
I don't make stories
for the camera
nor do I spread rumours.
I don't have the proof,
but I know where to get it from.
You may not think it's a big deal.
Today they're draining
our water, tomorrow
they could take our oxygen,
then our life force.
That's why we have to fight.
Nothing matters to me
more than the truth
and I will risk my life for it.
Insaaf.
Hey.. Who are you?
No one.
- How did you get inside?
It's nothing.
Stop.
Hey..
Give me your bag.
Give me your bag..
Get him!
Hey.. He's underneath.
There..
Grab him.. That side!
Grab him, get the bag!
This was in the bag.
The doctor says he was crossing
a road and was hit by a truck.
A case of accident.
Sign.
How did it happen?
The police say it
was an accident.
He used to attend your classes?
- Yes.
Regularly.
He never missed a class.
'Just stop the car, man!
- You're showing me this?'
'You're showing me this?
You're going'
'to America so you'll
jump the signal? - Reverse!'
'Reverse.. Siku.'
'They are stealing our water
and selling it back to us.'
'This is the truth.'
'I don't make stories
for the camera'
'nor do I spread rumours.'
'I don't have the proof,
but I know where to get it from.'
'I don't care what the media says
about me, or what you think of me.'
'Nothing matters to me
more than the truth'
'and I will risk my life for it.'
'Insaaf.'
"I've pledged.."
"I've pledged.."
"I've pledged.."
"I've pledged.."
"I'll bid farewell to my dreams"
"and embrace the harsh reality."
"I'll endure the darkness"
"which endangers
the light of truth."
"I'm off..

"What do I do with

"when my share of Earth
lies barren?"
'What's the point of living here?
Run away to America.'
'The country is crumbling anyway.'
'Does anyone make a difference?
No one does.'
'All of them are cowards like you.'
"Why should I be"
"an onlooker?"
"This thought.."
"Is my very flaw.."
"Paradise is something..
- Paradise is something.."
"That eludes me..
- That eludes me.."
"Because complaining
is in my nature."
I want to learn.
Martial arts is for self-defence,
not to fight others.
I didn't start the fight.
Go. Go home. Sleep.
Teach me.

I'm going out to eat.
How many times will she call up?
Tell me. Where do you want to..
When they ask who did this
tell them it was Bhavesh Joshi.
What will you say?
Bhavesh Joshi.
Our game
our name
are one and the same..
Insaaf.
His face was covered..
My jeans are too tight, pal.
Don't shake it.
- I'm not shaking it. Go.
Mr. Pawan!
- Bhavesh!
How are you?
- Very good.
What is this, man?
A model of corruption.
An abandoned 5-star hotel
built using black money.
The court imposed a stay
and it's been empty ever since.
Pal, where have you brought us?
Don't do this,
I'm telling you please..
I'm kidding.. - Please don't..
- I'm kidding..
It's not like I get a kick
out of scaring people but..
Pal.. My whole family has
blood pressure issues.
Both my parents have
high blood pressure.
Guys! Welcome to my 5-star den.
This is the sea-facing balcony.
That's the queen's room.
Sleep where you want to.
There's a sea-facing sofa.
And that's the washroom.
Pal, I'm using the washroom.
- Sure.
Listen. If you find a commode,
let us know.
Meaning? What?
Connect me to the Immigration.
Hello?
Take this name down please..
Sikandar Khanna.
Khanna, yes.
Yes, hello?
He's boarded? Alright. Thank you..
Hello?
- Anything? - Not yet.
Keep looking.
And update me if
you find anything.
Stop all the depot work.
Yes..
- Start working on our next plan.
'My name is Bhavesh Joshi.'
'You saw what happened
to me when I spoke the truth.'
'But our fight for
justice will continue.'
'They tarnish this country's law
and order, government, police'
'and its reputation.'
'Such people who have links with
Pakistan must be taught a lesson.'
'Sir, according to the
official announcement'
'there should be water supply
four times a day?'
'But Ward 6 gets water for
only a few hours a week.'
'Why?
- Why does Ward 6 have..'
'Hail Mother India..
- Hail..'
'We are standing outside
a middle income society'
'where Bhavesh Joshi'
'who uploaded a video
slandering the police, lives.'
'We have Mr. Subodh with us..'
"Here comes the damsel,
swaying to the beat.."
"She steals your heart
and enchants you.."
"Here comes the swaying damsel.."
"Here comes the swaying damsel.."
"Here comes the swaying damsel.."
Take this..
Will it work properly?
- 100 rupees.
I need four of these.
Useless..
Who is it? Hey..
I'm going to ask you
a few questions.
If you so much as whimper,
I'll kill you.
And leave you here to rot.
Name.
Speak up.
Subhash Mhatre.
- What do you do?
Assistant Officer, Ward 6.
Bhavesh Joshi.
Remember him?
- Yes..
No.
I don't know him.
- Don't lie.
When he got beaten by a mob,
you were there.
No. I don't know anything.
I haven't done anything.
I really don't know.
Who killed him?
Patil. Mr. Patil killed him.
Who is Patil?
Corporator of Ward 6.
Why did he kill him?
Bhavesh Joshi shot
a video of the tankers
and Patil's whole operation
and how Patil steals the government
water using the tankers.
He was going to give it
to the news channels.
What is Patil planning?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Who is Patil working for?
Speak up.
Help! Hurry up!
- What is Patil's plan?
Tell me!
- Help, help!
Who does he work for?
- Tell me!
What is Patil's plan? Say it!
- Get this psycho away from me!
Say it!
- Save me!
Break all his bones..
- Get him.. Don't let him go.
Hit..
- Untie me, quickly. Quickly!
Untie me, quickly.
You fool, untie the rope!
Untie me!
Come back here!
Hit him! Hard!
Hit him..
Darn you..
You.. Get up.
Hey..
Get him!
He jumped!
Get him. Get him.
Get him..
- Hey..
Hey.. My car!
Spare my car.
- Come..
Come on.
Come on..
Where is he?
There!
- There..
Get him!
Darn you!
Get up..
- Get up. - Up..
'Name?'
'Subhash Mhatre.'
'What do you do?'
'Assistant Officer, Ward 6.'
'Who killed Bhavesh Joshi?'
Listen.
How do I delete a video off YouTube?
Depends on whose channel it's on.
Someone else's channel.
We need his login ID and password.
Give it.
I don't have it.
You'll have to send a request on
the site. The process takes time..
I don't have time. It's urgent.
Why, man? Is it porn or something?
Porn sites are safe,
the rest may have some viruses.
Darn.
- What?
'As you can see,
the ward officer'
'is exposing the water scam.'
'After all, who is Bhavesh Joshi,
the one who recorded the video'
'and why is he breaking the law?'
'You thought I was dead.'
'You said I was a terrorist'
'an anti-national..'
'I told you that they're
stealing your water'
'and selling it back to you.'
'Now, I'm telling you again.'
'This time, I won't be beaten.'
'My name is Bhavesh Joshi.'
'And I'm still alive.'
'Today, Mumbai's Bhavesh Joshi
case has taken a shocking turn.'
'Mumbai's Ward 6 Municipal
Corporator, Hemant Patil'
'has been summoned to Malad Police
Station for further questioning.'
'Sources say that Bhavesh Joshi..'
- Do you know what's happening here?
'No. What's happening there?'
Someone is impersonating Bhavesh
and posting on the Insaaf channel.
'There's a video of an assistant
ward officer's confession.'
'He acknowledged the water theft
conspiracy'
'and named corporator Patil.'
The same scam Bhavesh
was involved in?
'Obviously, man.'
It's good that someone's
exposing it, right?
'Siku, you have to understand
how dangerous these guys are.'
'Messing with them
is a death wish.'
Sir, Mr. Rana is on the line.
Hello? - 'I'll handle
Mhatre and the media.'
'I'm sending someone,
you'll work with him.'
Okay.
The plan needs to work this time.
Find a permanent solution.
'Ward officer Subhash Mhatre's
corpse was found in Wadala today.'
'He is the one whose confession
video went viral overnight.'
'According to the police sources,
it was a suicide.'
'He slipped into depression
after the video went viral.'
'Police sources also tell us that
he has left behind a suicide note'
'which says that he was
forced into confession'
'blackmailed and that
everything he said was false.'
'Perhaps the disgrace caused by the
falsehood drove him to suicide.'
'They found no
evidence against me.'
'What evidence would they find
against an innocent man?'
'You tell me.'
'The real criminal, if any'
'is Bhavesh Joshi.'
'Or whoever it may be behind
the mask, hiding and running..'
'He's the one.
I think he's a terrorist'
'who is trying to spread fear'
'in our city, and our country.'
One!
Two!
Three!
Four!
Five!
When the tanker depot exploded
I knew you were the
lunatic behind it.
What do you want?
I want to finish
what Bhavesh started.
Again.
Stronger. Again.
One, two, three down..
Four and five.
Siku?
Patil goes to various
pipelines in the city.
He always has two bodyguards
and a guy with a ponytail
and glasses with him.
They do some checks,
test every pipeline and then leave.
You'll do it?
Go.
His tanker depot is shut, but
the tanker filling is happening.
What? - He fills water from
the BMC filtration plant.
Patil isn't selling
the water in the tankers.
He's sending the tankers
outside the city
to a plot in Dahanu.
There are 400-500 tankers
full of water, parked there.
Who knows how many plots
he has with tankers parked on them?
He goes with his gang to
chill at a dance bar at night.
"Even the cops tease me.."
"Everyone who meets
me shows generosity.."
"Can someone help me out?"
They have a VIP room at the back.
They were discussing something..
He was planning something.
Again.
Again.
Again.
Yes.. Again.
Again.
Again.
Didn't get me anything
from the US?
How did you find me?
I kept an eye on Sneha.
I figured I'd spot you around
and there's this place.
Siku, Mhatre died because of you.
He chose to side
with the devil, Rajat.
This is real life.
Things aren't black and white.
People like Mhatre can't always
choose between good and evil.
Are you defending him?
He's dead.
And Bhavesh?
Just because Bhavesh is dead,
will you kill everyone?
Then what do I do, Rajat?
Should I honour them?
And all this will
bring Bhavesh back?
Patil and his men are planning
something with this water.
And I have to stop them.
You can do nothing.
- Then don't leave me alone.
Work with me.
You used to write so many stories.
About super-heroes, corruption..
Were they just stories?
You aren't a hero, Siku.
I know.
I'm doing what I think is right.
Did you think about Sneha?
They will kill her.
You as well.
You're scared?
"My heart is singing.."
"My name is Bebo.
Steal my heart.."
"It's up for grabs.
Take it away.."
"My name is Bebo.
Steal my heart.."
"It's up for grabs.
Take it away.."
"Neither any rhyme.."
"Nor any reason.."
"For no rhyme or reason,
I was awarded death.."
This place.. Here, here..
But which area is blocked?
- This area is pretty blocked
you take care of the rest.
Only this area?
Or here and here as well?
Only here.
What do you use as a detonator?
Cellphone.
When?
Day after tomorrow.
- Day after tomorrow?
Done.
Sure?
- Sure.

Give me some water.
Hey!
What are you doing here?
Stop. Stop!
"Your kiss is very energising.."
"Your kiss is very energising.."
- Get him..
"Your kiss is very energising.."
"Your kiss is very energising.."
Where is he?
Glasses, he was wearing glasses..
He just went towards the right!
Run..
Where is he?
Go..
Go!
Start the car, go!
He has the guts to
come to my bar..
He's on a black bike..
And spy on me?
- Red-coloured headlights..
V-shaped headlights..
- He's dead.
He's wearing black clothes.
- Drive faster.
Link road..
- Drive faster!
One minute!
Where are you going?
Get him.. Now..
What are you doing? Go..
Start it now..
- Yes, sir.. - Come on..
Please come on..
Come on..
He's approaching, sir.
Shut it.
They are coming, sir.
He's gone up, sir!
What happened?
He went up.
Up? Up where?
- The railway station.
Hey.. Stop..
Stop!
Come on, come on..
There.. Come on!
Check everywhere.
Look in the carriages.
Hey..
Stop him!
Move!
Come on, now..
Hello?
- What have you done?
What happened?
- Have you lost your mind?
But what happened?
Put the news on.
On your marks! Salute!
Brothers, sisters and friends.
Our Mumbai is under threat.
Today,
someone tried to attack it again.
But what that person doesn't know
is that Mumbai's heart beats
with the millions of its people.
And when one of them bleeds
the rest become stronger.
Wow!
The strength to withstand
the chaos that reigns
the bloodshed
comes from Yogesh Sahu's sacrifice.
Yogesh Sahu watched over
Mumbai day and night.
He never took a day off on Diwali.
Even on the day of Ganesha
Chaturti, his uniform stayed on.
He stood on the beach and made sure
no child walked far
away from his family.
His sacrifice won't go in vain.
He will have justice.
Incredible.
Bhavesh Joshi is the name
of the terrorist
who is an agent of the enemy
and is here to destroy our
Mumbai and Mother India.
Not only must you stop this agent
you must also wipe out his
presence from the land.
I implore the CBI, NIA.. Every
government agency there is
to help us purge the city.
If you want a cleaner
and safer India
you must act on a cleaner
and safer Mumbai.
Only then can we cocoon
our Mother India.
And then
no Bhavesh Joshi can cross over
into our country.
Long live India.
Long live Maharashtra.
They're going to
blow up the pipeline.
That's why they're
collecting water in tankers.
They're going to sell
it back to the people.
Go to the police.
No point. They won't listen.
Then what are you going to do?
Siku..
It's not your job to stop them.
You need to leave this place.
They may get to you
while searching for me.
You will need me, Siku.
Your son needs you more than I do.
Hello?
If I don't call you tomorrow
then take my laptop
from the basement.
It has a video.
You'll understand
when you see it.
Where are you going?
Hello..
'Sneha, I'm sorry.'
'I lied to you about
going to Atlanta.'
'It's true that Bhavesh
died because of me.'
'And I did nothing about it.'
'I'm not a hero.'
'But I won't remain quiet.'
Tomorrow..
The one accused for this
will be you.
Have you heard the story of Icarus?
It's Greek mythology.
You don't know it?
- No.
There was once a king named Minos.
He kept Icarus and his father
prisoners on an island.
Deep water surrounded
the island on all sides
and there was no dream of escape.
Icarus believed
that his father was
such a good craftsman
he could build wings
for both of them
that would carry
them off the island.
Icarus's father relented
and made beautiful wings
from wax and bird feathers
which they used to fly away.
Icarus was ecstatic.
His father warned him
that if he rose too high,
the wax would melt.
But Icarus was in his own world.
He rose higher and higher..
The wax melted
and he fell.
Icarus died because he flew
too close to the sun.
Do you know why I'm telling
you this, Sikandar Khanna?
I am the sun.
It's done.
Take him.
Get up, Siku.
Come on!
Siku, hang on.
Siku, talk to me.
We're there, we're almost there.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Step back..
- Step back a little, sir.
Check his pulse, please.
Yes, sir.
It's bad.
He's lost a lot of blood.
We've given him painkillers.
Ma'am?
Ma'am?
- Yes?
I need to inform his family.
There's a landline at the reception.
Tell them
I'm dead.
Move please. Move aside.
His name?
Mohan.
Mohan Kher.

has been hit badly.'

on Mumbai in history.'
Tell me.
Sir..
I can take care
of all the city's water problems.
Without getting into the details
let's just say there'll be a
water tanker where you need one.
Free of cost.
But on one condition.
Any further pipeline contracts..
Any further contracts to do with
the city's water infrastructure..
'Hundreds of water tankers
are distributing water to the city.'
'Hereafter, these tankers will make
rounds of the city every day.'
'The Chief Minister has dealt
a masterstroke'
'against the water scarcity.'
'The people of Mumbai'
'expressed their gratitude
towards the Chief Minister.'
'Sneha, I am sorry.'
'I lied to you about
going to Atlanta.'
'The truth is that Bhavesh
died because of me.'
'And I did nothing about it.'
'I'm not a hero.'

'I don't know if
I'll see you again..'
'Meet you again..'
'I'm sorry.'
'I love you.'
Well..
I have got some of your stuff.
Laptop, camera, bag..
I'll meet you in the evening
after work hours.
Rajat!
Thank you.
'Siku, do you know what's the
difference between you and me?'
'I love this country
and I can't watch it suffer.'
'So I'm going to stay
here and change it.'
'Before the setting sun,
his dark silhouette stood'
'looking over the city.'
'The wind ruffled his hair.'
'This city was once his own.'
'The city he was born in.
Where he grew up..'
'He loved it.'
'Rajat, superheroes aren't born,
they are made.'
'Even they have a terrible life
just like we do.'
'But they don't make compromises.'
'They take their
problems head on.'

we should never give up.'
