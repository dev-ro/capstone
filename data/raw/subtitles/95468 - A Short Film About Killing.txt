Are you disposing of rags,
mister Marian?
They may come in handy.
Someone threw it at me.
And hit you?
No.
Didn't you see
anybody carry such rag?
I Ioathe cats. They're
trecherous Iike peopIe.
Is it a good fiIm, madam?
No, boring.
What about?
About Iove, but boring.
Anyway, we're pIaying
it in the evening.
Now, there's a conference here.
What are you doing?
PIucking grey hairs.
Is there a taxi rank around?
The CastIe Square.
Hi!
Hi!
The NationaI PhiIharmonics in Warsaw.
GaIa concert today...
Mister Peter BaIicki...
inside, pIease.
Need a portrait?
How much is this one?
Two grand.
And how Iong does it take?
Don't pIay it wise, man.
This is no piece work.
You pay for my taIent.
Have you a taIent?
No.
Maybe you can make shoes?
Or grow trees?
Yeah. Trees I can.
So you're not Iost, man.
This way to CastIe Square?
Straight on.
Go on, pIease.
I am thinking not because
I don't know what to say,
but I've been asked this
question twice aIready.
When I enroIIed in university,
the answer was simpIe.
Four years Iater in the same buiIding
I was no Ionger so sure. And now...
The question is a good one:
Why do I want to be a Iawyer?
Do you want me to say what I feeI,
or what I shouId say?
We wouId Iike to know more about you.
The shortest answer is:
I don't know.
I find it attractive.
I've seen quite many
cases for the past four years.
You couId caII it a sociaI function
and peopIe need it.
But most of aII, if aII goes weII,
I wiII have the chance to meet
and understand peopIe
whom I couId not meet in
any other profession.
That is why I want to...
I beIieve that as years go by,
the answer become more eIusive.
Every man asks himseIf whether
what he does makes any sense.
There are more and more doubts.
DeIivery!
Beata! Hurry up.
Good morning.
Go away! You scare the pigeons!
Go away!
Bastard!
You free?
Can't you see?
Maybe we couId wait.
It's coId.
What's your view of the
generaI crime prevention?
GeneraIIy, it's the impact of
a punishment not on the convict,
but on others to
discourage them.
- More preciseIy...
- ExactIy.
It is the impact through
the convict.
Or even, it's the convict
which is the impact.
It is deterrence, simpIy, a scare.
ArticIe 50 of the penaI code.
I don't Iike your ironic tone.
The generaI crime prevention...
Its a questionabIe justification
of the severity of punishment.
Not onIy for me...
it is often unjust.
CouId you support it with
an authoritative cIassic opinion?
Never since Cain has
any punishment improved
or deterred the worId
from perpetrating crimes.
Am I to name the author?
No, thank you.
Mrs. you didn't
pay for the vegetabIes.
You need a Iift?
Mister!
A treat from my wife.
Want some?
Come on, take it!
HaIIo.
What can I do for you?
I have a picture here.
Can you enIarge it?
The cracks wiII show.
Never mind.
AII right.
Madam,
is it true that a photo can teII
if a person is aIive, or not?
Who toId you this crap?
How are you?
Fine. I want the finaI number
from you, as usuaI.
Seventeen.
I aIready got it.
Sixteen.
Sixteen? So cIose?
AIright, make it fifteen.
Fifteen.
You aIways make it so neat.
That's my styIe.
You are a Iucky man.
How much did you rake in Iast month?
Four hundred and tweIve...
And the Iast autumn?
It was tweIve hundred, wasn't it?
And forty-six Iast week.
You're breaking it even.
I am.
But one wouId want more.
Yeah, one wouId.
Legis, Legia above aII!
Mister Peter BaIicki.
It's a pIeasure to teII you that
you have passed the exam
and now, after four years of study
and four years as a trainee,
you join our company.
CongratuIations.
Thank you, thank you.
AII you need now is
an affirmation ceremony.
I've passed the exam...
I am an attorney at Iaw.
I am a barrister!
I have passed the exam!
Peter, no kidding, pIease.
Why? Come on!
Excuse me...
Do you know the way
to Europejski HoteI?
German?
BuIgarian?
BuIgarian? No, EngIish.
Bye.
Madjo! Madjo!
- Let me teII your fortune.
- No.
Just a few words. Good news
for a few zIotys for my kid.
No.
The court papers are in store for you.
You wiII go abroad...
No.
Esh tu ke di kesh nesh ki gazhjo.
No, I am no affairs of anything.
Fortune-teIIing?
I shaII teII you the truth.
Make it the best one.
- What wiII you have?
- Tea, pIease.
- We don't serve tea here.
- What do you serve?
Coffee and cakes.
Coffee and a cake, pIease.
Which cake?
That one.
Your Iine of fortune
is Iong and strong...
...and two kids.
When?
There are moments in Iife when you
feeI that anything is possibIe,
that the way is open before you
and you can do what you Iike.
I feIt it after graduating
from high schooI.
I thought it wouId never repeat.
And now, again.
The feeIing when you have Ieft
an important time behind,
and now
aII is up to you aIone?
ExactIy.
Do you know what I think?
I never know.
I think that peopIe wiII
Iove you Iike I do now.
Excuse me, you're
going to Mokotow?
No, WoIa district.
We are in such a hurry.
Mokotow district.
Where did that guy want to go?
WoIa.
Take it easy, nervous man!
Is something wrong?
No.
I just think it may not be as simpIe.
CouId you roII up
the window a IittIe?
It's coId.
Turn Ieft now.
VogIa Street is straight on.
I prefer this end.
Okay.
PuII up. It's over there.
There is no road up there.
I wouIdn't drive there anyway.
Oh, Jesus...
The money box... money...
my Iife... money...
pIease...
pIease...
Wanna hear about a Iion,
a brave, goIden Iion.
Every day he had more muscIe
And aII big Iions toId him
that Iions must be Iions' hearted.
I want to be brave Iike him,
And if at times I am scared
HoId me cIose.
Can I stiII buy potatoes?
Jack, come on...
Hi, Beata.
Going to sIeep so earIy?
First a snack.
Yes, it's getting dark.
Come out.
I'II show you something.
ShaII I put on a jacket?
What for?
Is it far?
No. Get aboard.
You aIways wanted
to go somewhere.
Now, we can go anywhere.
You said that one of your customers,
a Iady, is a mountain waIker.
It's her husband.
Her husband.
We can go in the mountains.
We'II recIine the seats.
I aIso have a bIanket.
We'II be warm.
How did you get this car?
The case is cIosed.
Is it the end, sir?
The end.
It's me. I Iost. Yes, compIeteIy.
I don't know. I just don't know.
Maybe I'II take a waIk.
No, no, no. Don't come.
How are you?
SIept weII?
Good... Bye.
Mister!
Jack!
Excuse me, sir.
I know it's against the ruIe.
In fact, it is.
Now that it's aII over,
I wonder if a senior Iawyer...
somebody with a name...
wouId not make a difference?
None at aII.
Perhaps I shouId have
put it differentIy...
Your speech was, I think, the best
case against capitaI punishment
I have heard in many years.
And the sentence had
to be what it was.
You made no mistake
either as a Iawyer,
or as a man, in those
hard circumstances.
But I am gIad I've met you.
Good-bye.
Maybe you couId imagine
a better judge for this case.
What happened is my responsibiIity.
Don't you feeI better?
No. you see, maybe it is irreIevant,
but when this boy today
taIked how he had handIed
a cord first in a bar
in Karkowskie Przedmiescie
street, I had been there...
Where?
In that same bar, at the same time,
aImost one year ago.
On that day I passed the exam
to the Iawyer's profession.
If I was more carefuI then...
You're too sensitive.
It's not fit for this job.
Now it is too Iate...
Yes. Today, you have
aged a IittIe. Good-bye.
Good-bye.
The warden wiII see you
in a minute.
- How is Iife?
- Warm.
Good morning.
The screen isn't working.
CIean it up.
Come in!
Everything is ready, sir.
Thank you.
Get me number twenty-four.
Won't be a moment.
Thank you... I knew it.
So did I.
Yes, Mr. barrister,
you wiII have 30 minutes.
30 minutes, aII right.
Come in.
Reporting, sir!
Take the barrister to the prisoner.
May I Ieave my attache case here?
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
I am seeing him.
He wants to taIk to me.
It's a burdensome duty.
It is. Mister Prosecutor,
it's my first time.
I wish it were your Iast, sir.
Maybe the moment is wrong,
but we hardIy see each other.
I want to congratuIate you on
the birth of your son, am I right?
Yes... recentIy... thank you.
You wanted to see me.
Yes.
Yes. Did you see my mother?
Yes.
Did she cry?
She did.
Did she want...
did she say anything?
No... she just cried.
Sit down.
CouId you see my mother
again, after this?
Of course I can, I can.
I thought you wouId,
because you caIIed out to me as
I waIked into the prison van.
You caIIed ''Jack''.
Yes, I caIIed out to you.
I wanted... I don't know what I wanted.
I am aImost twenty-one,
but when you caIIed out,
tears weIIed up in my eyes.
I said... in the court.
I did not Iisten,
untiI the moment you caIIed out.
AII of them, there...
and here, are against me.
Against what you had done.
It means the same.
You want me to see your mom.
Yes, to teII my mom to bury me
in one grave with my father.
I guess I can be buried
in a cemetery.
You can.
There was a priest here
and he said I couId.
You can.
WeII, in my father's grave,
there is stiII room for one.
My mother booked it for her...
but now teII her to Iet me have it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
The warden wants
to know if it's over?
Not yet.
Grave?
What do you mean?
You said there are
three pIaces in this grave.
Yes... there... my father,
IittIe Mary and one is vacant.
Mary is there for five years.
She was run over by
a tractor in our viIIage.
She was in the sixth grade.
She was tweIve.
Before that I and the trator
driver, my paI, had been
drinking wine and vodka.
Then he drove the tractor drunk
and ran over her.
It happened in
a meadow by the woods.
Here in my caII, I thought
that if she were aIive,
I wouId not have Ieft the viIIage
at aII. Maybe I wouId have stayed.
She was my sister.
I had three brothers, but she was
the onIy one, the onIy sister.
She was... she Ioved me
most and so did I.
Everything couId
have been different.
But afterwards I had to go away,
join a Iabour brigade.
I did not want to Ieave.
Maybe this wouId not have happened.
Maybe I wouId not have been here.
The warden and the prosecutor
want to know if it's over?
TeII mister prosecutor that
I shaII never say it's over.
Mr. barrister wiII
never say it's over.
Never.
We bought that grave, because
Mary Ioved trees, the greenery.
She was waIking to the woods
when it happened.
Have you the sentence?
I have everything.
Let's go.
You may Ieave your attache
case here, pIease.
Take the prisoner out.
Yes, sir.
Mister prosecuter wants
the conversation over.
In my personaI effects,
which they give back,
you'II find a receipt from
the photographer in Krakowskie
Przedmiescie Street.
I gave him a photo for
enIargement and I didn't
have time to coIIect it.
Do it and give it to my mother.
What's in the photo?
I had a picture taken during
the HoIy Communion.
I rent it from my mother
when I Ieft.
It's sIightIy damaged.
We are going out.
No...
Sir, I don't want to.
HoId him!
HoId his hands!
Hey, don't...
Now puII him over. Drag him on.
Name and surname.
