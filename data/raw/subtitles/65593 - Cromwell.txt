Is that him?
Yes.
Oliver!
[ECHOES]
God be with you, Oliver.
And you too, John.
This is Henry Ireton,
a good friend.
Good day to you, sir.
Mr. lreton.
l've just been taking
a last look at my land.
We had heard you were
leaving, Mr. Cromwell.
We came from London directly.
You could have saved
yourself the effort, Mr. lreton.
If we could discuss it,
Oliver, I'm sure--
There is nothing
to discuss, John.
Well, come back to my house.
You've got a long journey back.
You must forgive
the manner
of our table, Mr. Pym.
Our best crockery
is packed for the voyage.
Bridget, fetch the bread.
Yes, Mother.
We had hoped to
persuade your husband
to change his mind
about going
to America, ma'am.
l should have thought
you would know Oliver
better than that, Mr. Pym.
lt was not
an easy decision, John.
This is my country,
my land. God has
been good to me here.
Then, sir, why are you leaving?
l have a family, Mr. lreton.
l owe it to my sons
to make a better life
for them.
England is no longer
a country for a young man.
l recall you often
spoke out strongly in
Parliament for the rights
and privileges
of the common people.
Ah.
That was a long
time ago, Mr. lreton.
I had a vision then.
A great nation.
Prosperous, God-fearing,
good laws, strong,
respected throughout the world.
That was the England
I dreamed of.
Well, sir, you are a squire now,
a man of property.
Perhaps you no longer care
for the common people.
Perhaps I've been
misinformed, sir.
l thought, as a Puritan,
you would see it
as your God-given duty
to do the Lord's work
in this land, regardless
of sacrifice.
Mr. lreton, l was
fighting for the liberty
of the common people
when you were
in knee breeches.
Then why
are you leaving?
l am leaving because
this country crawls
with greed and corruption.
It is governed by adventurers
and profiteers
who think more
of their pockets
than their principles.
l am leaving, sir, because
we have a king who taxes
the rich beyond its means
and steals land from
the poor to maintain
his lavish court
and his Catholic wife.
Now, when Parliament
objected against
these injustices
he closed
his Parliament down.
And our man
dare not speak his mind
for fear of imprisonment.
Oh, yes.
All my life l believed
it was God's work to fight
against such tyranny.
But God has turned
his back upon this nation,
and we are leaving it.
And what if Parliament
should be recalled,
Mr. Cromwell?
And why should a king do that?
He needs money, Oliver.
What? To build another palace?
No.
To fight a war.
A war, John?
A war against whom?
The Scots have assembled
and army on our border.
They may invade us
at any moment.
The king needs money
to raise an army.
Ah.
By the king's own decree,
Parliament has not sat
these past 1 2 years.
And now the king needs money.
Once Parliament has assembled,
it will lie within
our power to change
the whole structure
of government
in this country.
John, how many times
did we sit in Parliament
in the old days
and how many
resolutions
did we pass?
And how many times
did this king overrule us?
Oh, the king can have
his war with Scotland.
We will be in America.
There will be a war, Mr. Cromwell,
but it will not be with Scotland.
Henry.
With whom, Mr. Ireton?
Henry, we have argued
this matter many times.
I'm convinced of it.
A war against whom, Mr. lreton?
Against the king, sir.
The king?
You mean a civil war?
In England?
[CHUCKLES]
You know not the ways
of this nation, Mr. lreton.
Such things do not happen here.
And in my opinion,
it is long overdue.
l will not have
such talk in my house.
It is common enough talk
these days, I fear.
Then it is treasonable talk!
And I will not have it
in my house!
l mark the time when you
were much against the king
and never feared to say so.
In truth, there is much
in this king that
does offend me.
Yet, with all, I would not take up
arms against him, and I would
oppose any move to do so.
ln such a cause,
our swords will be
in God's hands.
It's an odd thing, Mr. Ireton.
Every man who wages war
believes God is on his side.
l warrant God should
often wonder who is
on his. Good evening, sir.
Well, if I did give you offence,
sir, I beg your pardon.
You're a young man, Mr. lreton.
lt's fitting a young man
should want to change the world.
Not the world, sir.
Only England.
With a civil war.
Good evening, Mrs. Cromwell.
Good evening, Mr. lreton.
I'll get your cloak,
Mr. Ireton.
I hope you'll forgive him.
Goodbye, John.
God be with you, Oliver.
[YELLlNG]
[COWS MOOlNG]
You've no right to do this.
Leave them animals be.
This is the common land.
[GRUNTING]
Any man who raises a hand
against the king's men
will be arrested.
You have no right to do this.
This land is ours.
Well, now it belongs
to the Earl of Manchester.
By whose authority?
By the authority of the king.
Then l say the king is a thief!
You're under arrest.
Take him away!
Bastards!
Look at him, now. What's he done?
He's done nothing.
Release that man!
Who the devil are you?
This man works for me.
Whatever he has done,
l will take full responsibility.
He has spoken treason
against the king. Will you
take responsibility for that?
The rights to pasture belong
to the common people.
By what authority,
Lord Manchester,
do you take that away?
By the authority
of His Majesty's
commissioners,
granting me and my friends
full rights to this land for
the purpose of improvement.
Such a contract cannot
be legal. lt is in violation
of the law of this land.
As a magistrate, you should know
the king is the law of this land.
On the contrary, my Lord
Manchester. lt is the king's
duty to maintain the law.
This is common land.
lt belongs to the people.
This is my land,
and you are trespassing.
It's only out of respect for your
rank I don't have you arrested
for obstructing the law.
Captain Lundsford!
My lord?
See that no unauthorized
person enters this area.
Yes, my lord.
Remove these people.
[CHATTERING]
[CHURCH BELL RINGING]
MAN: Good morrow to you, squire.
Good morrow, Mrs. Cromwell.
Squire, have you news
of my husband?
It's in God's hands,
Mrs. Carter.
And in the king's.
Aye.
PRlEST:
Let us pray.
Almighty God, look down
upon this thy house and we,
thy humble servants.
Grant us the spirit
of thy grace through
Jesus Christ, our Lord.
Amen.
Who has done this?
Answer me. Who has done this?
An edict, squire,
from the archbishop himself
and by order of the king.
By order of the king.
Is the Church of England
not a Protestant church?
Would the king
turn the house of God
into a Roman temple?
Mr. Cromwell, l beseech you.
Does the king think that God
can be bought with gold,
trinkets and gilded rubbish?
l know only
that l have
been instructed.
Has this king
forgotten
the Reformation?
[CRASHING]
Mr. Cromwell--
Away with it.
Popish idolatry!
[CLATTERING]
Did the Lord not say
unto Moses:
"Thou shalt not
make unto thyself
any graven image
nor bow down to them''?
Has this king forgotten
the Spanish lnquisition?
ls the Roman Catholic Church
to have a seat in Westminster?
[SCREAMS]
Oh, my God.
My God.
Oh, my God!
Goddamn this king.
MAN:
King's guard, attention!
Here we are, my lord.
[GRUNTS]
That'll do, damn it.
l'm not a damned cripple.
Me sticks, where are
me sticks? Come over
here, boy.
BO Y: Here they are, my lord.
Give me the damned things.
And who the devil are you?
Edward Hyde.
Ah.
Let's in to His Majesty.
Where is he?
He's at prayers, my lord.
Aye.
He might do well to pray and all.
We're gonna need some help.
First the lrish
and now the Scots.
You doesn't turn your back
on either of them.
Let us give thanks to our
mighty God, that he has
seen fit to bless this table
with the fruits of his bounty.
In the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ, amen.
Amen.
I did remark, madam,
with some distress
that His Highness,
Prince Charles, was absent
from prayers this morning.
He was with me, my lord.
He did pray with you?
In your chapel?
Yes, my lord.
l am most displeased.
lt is not fitting that
a future king of England
should make his devotions
in a Catholic chapel.
Your private beliefs are respected.
But this is a Protestant country
and as head of both church
and state, it is my God-given duty
to see that it so remains.
His Highness found the whole
business so boring, my lord,
that he fell asleep.
Didn't you, Charles?
Yes, madam.
I believe you will find
your church as solid
as ever, my lord.
Nevertheless, you will kindly see
that it does not happen again.
Yes, my lord.
Your Majesty, the Earl
of Strafford awaits
your pleasure.
My good Lord Strafford,
welcome back to England.
Thank you, my lord.
Your Majesty.
Your Royal Highness.
Most noble sovereign.
A chair for his lordship.
Thank you, my lord.
I'm sorry to see
you in pain.
lt is the agues from
the bogs of lreland,
my lord. Godforsaken place.
Saving your presence,
my lord bishop.
We would not have
summoned you, Lord Strafford,
had the situation here
not been of
a greatest urgency.
You've doubtless heard
that the Scottish rebels
are marching on Newcastle?
Aye, my lord.
You will whip
these barbarians
to their senses.
But what of lreland, my lord?
We'll deal with lreland in good time.
You'll march an army on Scotland.
Army. What army?
Most of your army lies rotting
beneath the bogs of Ireland.
What's left of it
is hard-pressed
to keep law and order.
Then we will raise
a second army.
I fear Your Majesty may find
that easier said than done.
What? l guarantee l could
raise 3000 men under arms
inside a month!
But could you guarantee
their loyalty, my lord?
Is there an Englishman living
who wouldn't draw a sword
against his king's enemies?
There would be many
Englishmen, my Lord Strafford,
who would more readily
draw swords against the king.
My God, who is this jackanapes
that mouths such treason
in your presence, my lord?
You've been away
a long time, Strafford.
Much here has changed.
Aye, I can see it has.
l fear Sir Edward
but speaks the truth.
To put an effective army
in the field against the Scots
will cost almost a million pounds.
The Crown does not
have a million pounds.
Are we just going to sit here
then and do nothing?
Then l will summon
Parliament and instruct
them to provide money.
Parliament?!
The king of England
go cap in hand to
the common people, like a--?
A beggar.
Aye! A beggar?
l have no choice.
l say take the money.
You, my lord, are absolved
before God and before man
from any such action.
For in extreme necessity,
the king is acquitted from
all rule of government
and can do all
that his power permits.
Power? Where is the power
of a king without an army?
l'll warrant you,
l'll raise an army.
We'll reduce this kingdom
to submission in one summer!
Do you mean, sir,
that l should declare war
on my own people?
Aye!
Before they declare
war on you.
Well, sons, there it is.
Parliament House.
Upon that place
rests all the hopes
of this nation
for a settlement
of its ills in peace.
Do you think it could
come to war, Father?
Well, Oliver,
when men run out
of words,
they reach
for their swords.
Let's hope we can
keep them talking.
MAN: The king demands
money to raise an army.
[YELLING]
MAN: This House demands
redress for grievances.
Grievances which the past
12 years have laid heavy
upon the nation. l say that--
Might l be heard? l say, therefore,
this House is resolved that we'll vote...
Welcome back
to Parliament.
...no money for the king!
Order! Order!
Neither will we take up
arms against our Scottish
brethren, unless...
Unless this Parliament
is allowed to function
as the true voice
of the people of England.
And not as a gathering
of lackeys to the king.
[CHEERING]
Sir Edward Hyde,
Your Majesty.
Well, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty.
l believe the House
will grant a loan to the Crown.
But only on
certain conditions.
Conditions?
What do you mean,
conditions?
What are these conditions,
Sir Edward?
In essence, sire,
that the Crown relinquishes
all authority over Parliament.
And who put forward
this proposal?
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden.
The Puritans.
They were well
supported, my lord.
And they call
themselves Englishmen?
My God, it's enough to make
a man deny his birthright.
Yet, withal, they still
be Englishmen.
They make a mockery
of the Crown!
They abuse the privilege
of free speech with sedition
and treason.
You're too loud,
Lord Strafford. lt is most
unpleasant to the ear.
So it has come to this, my lord.
That you now bargain for your Crown.
What would you have me do?
Arrest every man
who opposes me?
Hang them?
Would you rather make
a gift of the Crown of England
to the rabble in the street?
lt lies beyond my power
to arrest a citizen without
proper charges.
Charges are immaterial.
Such an act would subvert
the fundamental laws
of this land, madam.
Such an act might
save the Crown
of England, my lord.
l've governed this
country justly and
fairly these 12 years
without reference
to any Parliament.
You may be assured,
l do not intend now to be
schooled in my high office
by illiterate farm
hands, cobblers
and basket weavers.
My Lord Strafford,
you will rid us of
these troublemakers:
Pym, Ireton,
all of them.
l'll arrest every one of them, my lord.
As you will.
l shall need a warrant.
That is imperative.
And what will the
charges be, my lord?
You're an experienced officer
of the Crown, Strafford.
You do not need
to be instructed
by me.
Mr. Speaker.
May l have permission
to address the House?
SPEAKER: By all means, sir.
Gentlemen.
A matter has come
to my notice, which is
of deep concern to me
and will, l am sure,
be to every single
member of this House.
The Earl of Strafford has,
this day, put his hand
to a warrant
for the arrest
and impeachment
of myself
and four other honourable
members of this House
upon a charge
of high treason.
[YELLING]
Though Strafford's hand
be upon this warrant,
l see in this business,
not the hand of Strafford,
but that of the king.
My lords!
l beseech you,
do not condemn
this king too hastily.
For l am persuaded
he has been ill-advised
upon this course.
Is not a king to be judged
by those from whom
he seeks counsel?
He is not!
lt is not the function
of this House to sit
in judgement upon this king.
The fault lies with those
very people from whom
the king has sought counsel.
l therefore move
that this House demands
the arrest and impeachment
of the Earl of Strafford
upon a charge of high treason
against the people of this nation.
Silence! Order!
The motion has been proposed.
Let it be put now to the question.
Is the motion agreed?
MEN: No!
In favour of the motion?
MEN:
Aye! Aye! Aye!
The ayes have it.
l think my Lord
Strafford's condition
will soon be far
happier than mine.
[PRAYING IN FRENCH]
Do you see, madam?
Do you see now what
you've made me do?
[CONTINUES PRAYING]
Gentlemen, His Majesty.
Pray be seated.
Your coming is
nothing if not timely.
My Lord Strafford's head
has but barely fallen.
Now, gentlemen,
it is for you to speak.
Your Majesty, you see here
the leaders of all parties
of the House.
And though we be divided
on many issues, we are
of one accord.
ln that we place above
all else, our allegiance
and loyalty
to our most
gracious sovereign.
For which reason
we are deeply anxious
for a settlement
of the differences
between us.
I share your sentiment,
Sir Edward.
The issue be this,
my lord.
Parliament is persuaded
that without the right
to govern this nation
by the will of the people
and with God's guidance,
we be not a Parliament at all.
And that unless some
constitutional reformation
be brought about,
we would as well
go back to our homes and
our farms as pursue this
mockery of a government
one more day.
In short, Mr. Pym,
you're asking me
to relinquish my sovereign
power over Parliament.
It does amount to that,
Your Majesty.
l do swear that l hold
this England and its laws
dearer to my heart
than any here.
But gentlemen, if you were
to reduce me to a
figurehead, a puppet king
manipulated by Parliament,
how then would I serve
my country?
What manner
of king would l be?
I am persuaded,
Your Majesty,
that England must move forward
to a more enlightened
form of government
based upon
a true representation
of a free people.
Such an institution
is known as democracy, sir.
A democracy, Mr...?
Cromwell, sir.
Democracy, Mr. Cromwell,
was a Greek drollery
based on the foolish
notion that there are
extraordinary possibilities
in very ordinary people.
lt is the ordinary people,
my lord, who would most
readily lay down their lives
in defence of your realm.
lt is simply
that being ordinary,
they would prefer
to be asked and not told.
You know, as l do, that even
as we sit here, the Scots rebels
are invading this land
and not an English sword
is raised against them. l beg you,
therefore, let us bury our differences
in defence of both
our church and kingdom.
The Scots invade our land
and all is urgency and alarm.
ln the past 12 months
our lrish colonists
have been slaughtered,
our churches desecrated,
our clergy persecuted.
The Crown has been
oddly reluctant
to defend our church
and kingdom over there, sir.
By my guard, l would
as soon take up arms
against Rome
than against the Scots.
Would you have me
declare war
on the entire Catholic
world, Mr. Cromwell?
lt is your duty to
defend our church, sir.
We are speaking now
of a matter of
international policy.
ls Your Majesty sure
that it's not a matter
of domestic expediency?
Come, sir!
l would remind you, sir,
that you are
addressing your king.
Mr. Cromwell,
you are impertinent.
Such issues are beyond
good manners, sir.
Catholicism is more
than a religion, it is
a political power.
Therefore, l am led to believe
there will be no peace in lreland
until the Catholic Church
is crushed.
Your Majesty.
CHARLES: These gentlemen
are from the Parliament.
Your Majesty,
Parliament has drawn
up this document
in which are set out
our main grievances.
lt is our belief that
the demands made here
are only those
that are just and lawful
and in the best interests
of both Crown and kingdom.
I shall examine these proposals
most carefully, Mr. Pym.
Gentlemen.
It is not too late,
my lord.
You have the power still.
And with God's help,
the strength to use
that power.
Oh, my dearest Charles.
I married you as a king
and as a man.
l beseech you,
do not disappoint me
in either aspect.
''This House has
time and again
expressed its
wholehearted loyalty
to the Crown.
Yet...
doth Parliament await
in vain for a gesture..."
The king is coming with
a warrant to arrest you,
John Hampden, Henry lreton,
Sir Arthur Haselrig
and Oliver Cromwell under
charge of high treason.
l suggest you
leave immediately.
''--that if the issues
that divide the king
from his country
be not soon resolved,
then these issues may
soon divide the nation."
[CHEERING]
The king is coming
with a warrant
for our arrest.
What?
We must leave at once.
Oliver, your name
is on it.
Come!
My lords! My lords!
Gentlemen! The king comes.
He comes with 100 men-at-arms.
The doors! The doors!
Bolt the doors!
Stand aside, gentlemen, if you please.
MAN: Halt!
Open in the name of the king!
Mr. Speaker.
Gentlemen, you must
pardon this infringement
of your privilege
but I will not detain you long.
Mr. Speaker, I must
make bold with
your chair.
l have here a warrant
for the arrest of five
members of this House.
John Pym, Henry Ireton,
John Hampden,
Oliver Cromwell
and Sir Arthur Haselrig
upon a charge of treason.
I see that the birds
have flown.
Mr. Speaker,
where are
these gentlemen?
May it please
Your Majesty,
I have neither eyes to see
nor tongue to speak
except as this House
gives me leave.
Well, sir, l have eyes.
l see that one of them is here.
Captain.
CAPTAIN:
Take him!
Any action against
a member of this House
is a breach of privilege.
I move this House declares
as public enemies
any who lay hands
upon its members.
And I further move...
l further move that any
such action against this House
be considered a crime
against the people
and treason against
this nation.
[CHEERING]
So be it.
Mr. Speaker, you will inform
the members of this House
that their presence is no longer
required by the nation.
This Parliament is, by my authority,
terminated, dissolved.
Your Majesty!
Are you aware
that by your action
in this House today
you may have pushed
this nation to the brink
of civil war?
Now do we see
in what contempt
this king holds this
House and this nation?
It be either your king
or your Parliament.
Honourable members,
the decision is yours.
But l beseech you,
in the name of God,
think well on it.
Fairfax.
Gentlemen.
I move that this House
demand the control
of the militia
and that this country
be put in an immediate
posture of defence.
Mr. Speaker.
My lords.
Honourable members.
This nation is now
in a state of civil war.
And let us pray
that God in his mercy
will give us strength
in this terrible
and most unhappy hour.

Your men fit, colonel?
My men are ready, my lord.
You seem damned eager

Cromwell.
We all enter this reluctantly,

Is that not so, Lord Essex?
You are right.
Well, to your position.
Let no man move

And may God look kindly

Amen to that.
Missed my breakfast.
Damned tricky things,

Well, Essex, are you prepared?
We are. Shall we begin at 10?
Make it 9, my lord.
l'm positively starving.
Then in God's name,
let's to it.
lt is agreed then, 9:00.
And by my faith, which l have not,
I swear that within the hour,
this field will be strewn
with English dead.
If this be so, they will have
been killed by Englishmen.
For we have not seen fit

mercenaries into our ranks.
I will mark you well

are we waiting for?
Ireton!
l thought we came here to do battle.
We're waiting for the appointed time.
The appointed time?
Colonel Hampden, commence firing!
Fire!
What the devil
is that fool doing?
Artillery, commence firing!
Fire!
O Lord, thou knowest
how busy I must be
this day.
lf l forget thee,
do not thou forget me.
MAN:
Fire!
Fire!
You'd better send Fairfax in.
Mm.
Bugler, sound
the charge.
[BUGLE SOUNDING]
Troop at the gallop.
Advance!
[YELLING]
[GUNS FIRING]
Signal Astley to advance.
Bugler, sound the advance.
[BUGLE SOUNDING]
The sport begins.
Tallyho!
Troops rear left.
At a gallop, charge!
[YELLS]
Give fire!
[GROANS]
Advance!
MAN:
Advance!
MAN:
Fire!
Advance pike!
Charge pike!
[YELLS]
Fire! Second
rank forward!
At the gallop!
It's getting too damned
close for my liking.
Sound general retreat.
Sound general retreat.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
My lord, why in the name
of Christ did you sound
the retreat?
Colonel, you've countermined
my orders once today. You'll
do as you're told, sir.
Hold your ground,
in the name of God!
Hold your ground!
Well, Uncle, did you
ever see a quarry
so swiftly put to flight?
The king will forever
keep this field and
this day's service
in grateful remembrance.
[MEN CHEERING]
[HORSE NEIGHING]
Come nightfall,
we shall bury our dead.
And then, by God,
we shall bury this army.
With such pitiful men
in our ranks, it were better
this war were never fought.
Not a drop of English blood
soiled this English land.
lt's a bad officer who
blames his men, Cromwell.
I blame them not, my lord,
for they are simple men.
But what match are farmer's boys
against gentlemen's sons?
The battle is not
yet lost, Cromwell.
This battle were lost
before it began, my lord.
And in like manner,
so will this war.
ln the morning,
l'm returning to Cambridge.
If you desert the field,
I'll have you arrested.
This war will not be won
with untrained ploughmen,
apprentices,
old, decaying serving men.
We need men with fire
in their bowels who fear
the Lord, but not the enemy!
As God is my witness,
l am resolved that
this battle will be won.
Therefore, it's my intention
to return to Cambridge,
and raise an army
of handpicked men,
the like of which this nation
has never seen!
With or without
your permission,
my Lord Manchester.
[MEN YELLING]
[CLANKING]
Bristol will not be permitted
to fall. lt is our only seaport
in the west,
and if General Goring
is incapable of holding it,
then I will dispatch
someone who can.
l've a mind to see Bristol,
my lord. lt is a fair city, l hear.
Then I shall place Bristol in your
command, nephew. Now, my lord
general, should our forces--
Your Majesty.
Yes, what is it?
News of Cromwell's army,
Your Majesty.
Come forward.
At last, Old lronsides ventures forth.
Well, speak, man.
They're about six miles
away, Your Majesty.
Just south of Naseby.
By my reckoning,
there be about 1000 horse
and 2000 afoot.
And what news of Manchester's army?
l saw no other army, Your Majesty.
Was not Cromwell
to join Manchester's
forces at Naseby?
That was our intelligence,
Your Majesty.
Then Manchester
be still in Lincoln.
So Cromwell comes
with his army of 3000
to our 7000.
By your leave, Uncle. Your Highness.
General Astley, sound the alert.
l want every man
in full battle order at once.
[BUGLE SOUNDS]
By God, we have him!
Manchester!
[ECHOING]
Where in the name
of Christ is he?
Know you not
we are at war?
ln God's name
l do swear we fight
this war single-handed.
Oliver.
What bloody
treachery is this?
We came to meet
Manchester and instead
we find the king's army.
Well, I shall take
on the king.
And after that
if needs must, l'll take
on Manchester as well!
Before you stands the enemy,
his three to every one of us.
And where, in God's
name, is Manchester?
My Lord Manchester will rue
the day he has not joined us here.
And now to your positions.
These tactics we have
practiced often enough
these past six months
now let us put them to the test.
For upon this field
of Naseby, we'll turn
the tide of this unhappy war.
God be with you all.
ls this wise, Oliver?
We're heavily outnumbered.
Was not Gideon outnumbered
by the Amalekites?
It is not numbers that count,
but speed and surprise.
Let no man move, except upon
the word of his commander!
Though we be outnumbered,
we shall win this battle!
I promise you!
So now put your faith in God
and keep your powder dry.
[MEN CHEERING]
Halt!
Attack order.
Double line abreast.
Forward.
MAN: Forward!
The man must be mad.
Prepare to attack.
Prepare to attack!
[DOG WHIMPERS]
Our swords
are in God's hand.
And our faith
is in the Lord.
Charge!
Fire!
Forward!
[HORSES NEIGH]
Colonel!
Regroup! Regroup!
After them!
Advance!
To the rear!
Forward!
Come on, lads!
At the gallop!
Your Majesty,
may l suggest
that we withdraw?
No.
[CHATTERING]
MAN:
Who goes there?
RlCHARD:
Captain Cromwell, 3rd Cavalry.
Richard.
Thanks be to God.
Where is Oliver?
The outrageous incompetence
and inefficiency
of the high command
have tried my patience
and that of my hard-pressed
army long enough.
By my faith, l swear
it would be better that
those gallant generals
Essex and Manchester,
took up swords with the king.
For then might we be
assured of victory.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
For by their reluctance
to pursue this war with
the intensity it demands,
they have proved
treacherous both to our
cause and to this nation.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
If we beat the king 99 times,
he will still be our king
and we his subjects.
If he beats us but once,
we shall all be hanged.
lf that is so, then why
in the bowels of Christ
did we take up arms against him
in the first place?
Gentlemen,
honest men
have served us faithfully
and many have died
that this House may sit
in freedom and this nation
live in liberty.
In the name of God,
I beseech you,
do not desert them now.
Unless Parliament supports
this war to the full,
l am bound to say,
in all conscience, that
l will lay down my sword
and let this House make
its peace with the king,
be that peace ever so base.
[MEN YELLING]
Then, it is for
this House to decide.
l move that this
House demands
the immediate resignation
of the high command
upon the grounds that
they be no longer competent
to command the armed forces
of this Parliament.
Order. Order. Order!
The motion has been proposed.
Let it now be put to the question.
Those against Cromwell's motion.
MEN: No!
Those in favour of the motion.
MEN: Aye!
The ayes have it.
The motion be carried.
I move...
l move that Colonel
Cromwell be appointed
commander in chief
of the army.
MEN:
Yeah!
Bristol. We must dispatch aid
to Bristol with all possible speed,
for as long as Rupert holds
Bristol, this war be not lost.
General Digby, if you can
detach your forces in this area
and approach Bristol
from the east--
To do that, my lord,
would be to expose this
city to immediate attack.
Then we move the
Marquis of Huntly's
army southward.
The marquis, my lord,
surrendered to Cromwell's
forces yesterday.
Cromwell. I hear nothing
but Cromwell, Cromwell.
My lord, it is but
a game we play here,
a game with wooden armies
and paper flags.
'Tis but a block of wood
you hold in your hand.
My lords, all l ask for is a little time.
Time, my lord, costs us heavily.
lf we can hold on here
in Oxford for six weeks,
the Scots have promised
an army of 20,000 men.
Her Majesty is in communication
with my cousin, the king of France,
and I have good reason to hope
for support from Ireland.
An army from Ireland,
Your Majesty?
I would as soon join forces
with Cromwell himself
as take up arms with the Catholics!
I am the king and defender
of my people
and l maintain the right
to seek relief from
no matter what quarter.
As king, my lord, it is
your God-given duty to
defend the faith of this nation.
I do what I think
to be right, sir.
Catholics as allies!
lt is unthinkable!
My God, if it
has come to this,
let us rather sue for
an honourable peace than
fight a dishonourable war.
I will not countenance defeat.
Rather than abandon
my kingdom to Parliament,
I would come to terms
with the devil himself.
Since you came
to the throne, Your Majesty,
your armies have
persistently persecuted
our Church in lreland.
And yet, now that
your need is great,
you turn to us for help.
The king's actions
in lreland, Your Excellency,
will seem as nothing should
these Puritans come to power.
lt is not only
the Crown of England
that is in peril, Excellency.
All institutions
of established order
throughout the countries
of Europe are threatened.
An Irish army of 20,000 men,
even 1 5,000,
would forestall such a threat
and bring this wretched war
to a speedy end.
I am instructed to say
that His Holiness
would permit
an lrish force to take up
arms in this country.
But there are certain conditions.
First, the Catholic Church
in Ireland must be
completely restored
and permitted to
practice freely without
interference or oppression.
Secondly, all Protestant
churches in lreland must
be closed
and all Protestant bishops
and ministers removed
from office.
Oh, there are one or
two other minor conditions
of little consequence.
What you demand, Excellency,
would be a betrayal
of my coronation oath
as head of the English Church.
You have a duty, Charles,
to the Crown.
For without that,
you will be head
of nothing!
May I tell His Holiness
that you will agree
to these conditions?
You have something
to say to me, Sir Edward?
Your Majesty, His Highness
Prince Rupert attends
in the council chamber.
Rupert? Here in Oxford?
Yes, my lord.
I fear Bristol has fallen.
[ddd]
Your Excellency will excuse me.
Your Majesty.
My lords,
His Majesty.
Do you not rise, sir,
when your king approaches?
Rise, sir! Or to
your knees in shame.
You did give me
your most solemn promise
that you would hold Bristol
for four months.
Yet you have not held it
for four weeks!
You promised mountains,
yet you perform molehills.
You make a knave
of your king.
My lord,
we were besieged
on all sides.
Our men are foot-weary
from battle, ailing with
plague and sickness.
Yet you contrived
to escape with your life.
I have brought you
an army, my lord.
An army 2000 strong,
ready and willing to fight
on for their king!
ln exchange for all the corn
and stores you held in Bristol
and 200 cannon.
That was the price
of your freedom, sir.
I did what I considered
to be right!
You deserted
your command, sir.
I made a military decision.
A decision that may have
cost us this war.
Your action in this matter
is of such affliction to me, sir,
that it is the greatest trial
that has yet befallen me.
My conclusion is
to desire you to seek subsistence
elsewhere, not in my kingdom.
Most gracious lord,
l do not crave forgiveness,
for by all as l hold most dear,
l do solemnly swear that
l acted only in good faith!
The matter is at an end.
I will hear no more.
My lord!
My lord, I beseech you.
ln God's name, allow
that l may die with honour.
Condemn me not to live.
Captain Lundsford.
Do not put upon these
shoulders the terrible shame
of exile and dishonour.
I beg you, take my life,
most noble lord.
Good Uncle,
for pity's sake!
His Highness is to be kept
under close guard
until such time
as he is deported.
Very well, Your Majesty.
Father, Mother says
I'm to go with her
tonight to France.
ls that your wish, Father?
Yes.
My duty is to stay here
with you and fight beside you.
Your place now is at
your mother's side, Charles.
You will help her raise
money, perhaps an army.
Should l meet my death,
and you are safely in France,
then England will still have,
in you, a lawful king.
You will go
with your mother.
I love this land.
And when this great
responsibility becomes yours
then l pray that
with God's help,
you will reign more happily
than I have done.
Now go, with God's speed
and your father's blessing.
Oh, Charles.
I love you.
[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING]
Your Majesty, it is
my most solemn duty
to place you under arrest.
By whose command, sir?
By the command of Parliament, sir.
I know of no authority
in England above that
of the king.
lt is upon that issue
that this war was fought.
Whither am l to be taken?
To London, sir.
You must grant me a little time to--
We leave for London at once.
And my children, what of them?
We will take care of your children.
His Majesty will have
all the time he requires.
As for your children, sir,
you may take them with you.
I thank you, sir.
PEOPLE SlNGlNG:

His praise foretell
Come ye before him
And rejoice
The Lord ye know
Is God indeed
Without our aid
He did us mak e
We are his flock
General, John Pym
is dead.
And for his sheep
He doth us tak e
When did it happen?
This morning.
What is it?
John Pym is dead.
Parliament is discussing
peace terms with the king.
Does the army
have no say in this?
The army has been
ordered to disband.
ln God's name,
did we fight this war
that the politicians should
take over behind our backs?!
If Parliament has decided
the army will disband,
then the army will disband.
l say we take the army
and march on Parliament.
The sword will
not rule this land.
We fought to institute
a parliamentary system
and overthrow the very tyranny
which you now propose.
And who is talking
to the king? Parliament?
l doubt it. l warrant
l know who is doing
all the talking.
I have these past three days
been in consultation with
His Majesty the king.
And l am pleased
to inform the House
that the king is now prepared
to discuss peace terms
provided that the army
stand down.
l have given this House's assurance
that his wishes will be complied with.
Further, in recognition
of the very great debt
this House owes its commander,
General Cromwell,
it is proposed to award him
a pension of 3000 pounds a year
together with certain estates
in the county of Cambridge.
[MEN APPLAUD]
It is further proposed that
the sum of 2000 pounds--
Such low treachery
is not worthy even of you,
my Lord Manchester.
Am I to believe my ears?
Did this nation win
a bloody civil war
in order the king should
dictate the terms of peace?
l have already discussed
the matter at great length
with His Majesty--
You have discussed it?
lt is a matter for this House
to discuss.
MEN:
Hear, hear!
The king will not come
to terms, sir, until
the army stand down.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
And the army will
not stand down until
the king comes to terms.
So if the king
will not talk to this House,
then let the king
talk to the army.
Out of the question.
The king would never agree.
Parliament is behind us, sir,
and on this occasion,
we have the majority.
Sir Thomas Fairfax.
MAN: He's bringing in the army!
SPEAKER: Order! Order!
Order, I say!
Order! Silence! Order!
Order!
Silence!
Order!
I believe, my Lord Manchester,
that now I have the majority.
This is dictatorship.
lt will mean a new civil war.
SPEAKER:
Order!
Honourable members,
l swear before my God
that you give me no alternative.
When those liberties for which
this army and this nation
have fought so hard
are most solemnly guaranteed
then this army
will stand down.
And upon that, you have
my most sacred promise.
[MEN CHATTERING]
[CHILDREN LAUGHING]
[BELLS RINGING IN DISTANCE]
[CHARLES LAUGHS]
And who have we here?
lt is l, my lord.
You were supposed to
have run, Sir Edward,
not let me catch you.
l'm afraid l'm getting
a little too old for
such games, my lord.
Cromwell is here to see you.
Oh.
You must play on
your own now, children.
Your father has
other games to play.
Prince Henry, you will be
good enough to give me
back my hat.
Sir.
Gentlemen,
His Majesty.
We came to present
our terms, my lord.
If Your Majesty will be
so kind as to study
these proposals.
Has Parliament approved this treaty?
Parliament no longer truly
represents the people
of this nation, Sir Edward.
And you, Mr. Cromwell,
do you truly represent
the people of this nation?
I represent the army, sir,
and the army is the heart
and conscience of the people.
So having failed to come
to terms with Parliament,
you would now
negotiate with the king.
l am not bound
to negotiate with anyone.
With 50,000 men
under my command
I could impose a government
on this nation overnight.
One is given to wondering,
Mr. Cromwell, why you do not do that.
I am deeply convinced,
my lord, it be the duty
of Parliament
to frame a constitutional
government, and not the army.
Then l do not see that
you have any need of me at all.
On the contrary, sir.
An England without
a king is unthinkable.
But withal, a king
that can command respect
a monarch who governs,
not from fear,
but by the affection
of a free people.
Such a king could reunite
this great nation of ours
and make the name of England
the noblest in all Christendom.
Should you adorn
that inheritance, my lord,
all Englishmen would
be proud to call you king.
Mr. Cromwell, l do confess
that l did greatly misjudge you,
for l did mark you
as an ambitious man.
To these ends, my lord,
I am ambitious.
Then you have
my respect, sir.
Thank you, my lord.
We shall return in the morning, sir.
l shall require a little longer to study
this document.
Perhaps a week.
As Your Majesty pleases.
I sincerely hope that our
future relations may be
equally amiable, sir.
That is my hope also,
my lord.
A cunning fellow.
l believe him to be
a sincere man, my lord.
Indeed.
If these proposals
be acceptable,
there never was
a Crown so nearly lost,
so easily recovered.
Whatever these proposals
may be, Sir Edward,
they are not acceptable
to the king.
MAN: Cromwell has betrayed us!
CROWD: Aye!
We have given our blood
and our lives in this war
to put down this king!
lf Cromwell comes
to terms with him now,
what price our freedom then?
Get back, will you?!
l have served General
Cromwell faithfully all my life,
and l reckoned him to be
a man who feared God
and did honour his word!
But in this business
he has shown himself to be
a man of no honour!
MEN:
Aye!
We fought this war
to remove this king,
not to put him back
on the throne!
MEN: Aye!
l say, let us march on London,
let us take Parliament,
and then let the king
try to negotiate with us!
MAN:
Make way for Cromwell.
Traitors! Mutineers!
l don't have to tell you,
any of you, you could all
be hanged for this.
We are not serfs, general,
nor mercenaries.
We fought for the Lord
in our cause, and now
we have a right to speak.
You have no rights
to preach revolt and mutiny.
As for you, John Carter,
l did expect a greater degree
of loyalty from you.
l am still loyal to what
l fought for, sir. Can
the same be said of you?
l have not betrayed
my God, country, Parliament
or my conscience.
Where was your conscience
this day, when you parleyed
with the king?
I tell you, all of you,
l do most honestly believe that
we have taught this king a lesson.
And he will prove most honourable.
Upon that I would stake my life.
Traitor! Traitor!
This is a military camp, sir,
not a debating chamber.
Under military law,
any man inciting mutiny
can be hanged.
Colonel Harrison.
Yes, General.
These three men
will draw lots. One
of them will be hanged.
Captain Lancing, get a length of rope.
Yes, sir.
You, man.
Yes, sir.
Pick up some straws.
General, there is
a Sir Edward Hyde
to see you.
Sir Edward, has the king
considered our terms?
The king, sir, has not
even read your terms.
Nor, will l venture,
has he any intention
of so doing.
He has, this day, drawn up
a secret treaty with
Manchester and Essex
to raise a Scottish army
against the Parliamentary forces.
He has already consented
to a Catholic army from lreland.
While you negotiate
a settlement with him,
he is planning
a second civil war.
l do confess that l have
these many years given
my allegiance to a man
not worthy of the title,
king of England.
Colonel Harrison!
I will have this king's head..
Aye, and the Crown upon it.
This obstinate king,
this man of blood,
whose heart God
has hardened, can
no longer be trusted.
For in prodigious treason,
he has revealed himself
to be a traitor.
A man of no honour.
A man unfitted to bear
the title, king of England.
MEN:
Hear, hear.
l demand, therefore,
in the name of the army
and the people of this nation
that Charles l, king of England,
be brought hence
to stand trial for his life
on a charge of treason.
Oyez, oyez, oyez.
All manner of persons
having anything to do
with this court,
come forward
and give your
attendance.
Every man to keep silence
upon pain of imprisonment.
God save the king.
Let the prisoner be brought in.
[CHATTERING]
The clerk of arraigns
will read the charges.
"Charles Stuart,
king of England,
you stand before this court
charged with high treason.
ln that being admitted
king of England, and
therein trusted with power
to govern according
to the laws, you did out
of wickedness and design
erect and uphold
in yourself an unlimited
and tyrannical power.
To rule at your will
and overthrow the rights
and liberties of the people.
And that you did
traitorously and maliciously
levy a cruel war
against Parliament
and the people.
And are therefore guilty
of all the treasons,
rapings, burnings, spoils,
desolations, damages
and mischiefs to the nation
committed in the said war.
Thus, on behalf
of the people of England,
this court impeaches
you as a tyrant,
traitor, murderer
and public enemy to the
Commonwealth of England."
God save the king!
JUDGE:
Silence!
Sir, you have heard
the charges against you.
The court expects
an answer.
First, l would know
by what authority,
l mean lawful authority,
l am brought here
and carried from place
to place, and l know not what.
And by what authority
you presume to sit
in judgement on me.
Remember,
l am your lawful king.
Think well upon it.
I have a trust committed
to me by God, by old
and lawful descent.
Therefore, let me know
by what authority
I am brought here,
and I shall answer.
It is not for the prisoner
to question the court.
I am no ordinary prisoner, sir.
An answer, sir,
the court demands
an answer.
Then I refuse an answer.
Sir, you are before
a court of justice.
Well, sir...
l see that l am
before a power.
[CHATTERING]
JUDGE:
The court will keep silent.
Mr. Solicitor General,
are your witnesses prepared?
They are, my lord.
Then let them be brought forth.
Call Sir Edward Hyde.
And you saw the king
and his wife alone
in their chambers
with this Catholic
Archbishop Rinuccini?
I did.
And what did you
assume was the
purpose of this meeting?
You are obliged
to answer, Sir Edward.
To raise an Irish
army, my lord.
To fight against
the Parliamentary forces?
And at this time, was
the king in communication
with any other
foreign power?
Yes. Yes, with the king
of France and with the Dutch.
For the same purpose?
Yes.
To raise a foreign army
to invade this country,
and to perpetuate
the war against the
people of this kingdom.
Sir Edward?
Yes.
[CROWD YELLING]
To the block with him!
[GAVEL POUNDS]
Sir, throughout
the three days
of this hearing,
this court has patiently
awaited your pleasure
to hear what you have
to say in answer to the
charges against you.
Yet you have declined
to speak.
l am most willing, sir,
to answer before Parliament,
but not before
this assembly
whose authority
l refuse to acknowledge.
Sir, what answers you may offer
the commons can be given here.
For this court does
sit in the name of
the House of Commons.
Sir, if, as you have said,
you do love the liberty
of the subject,
you will grant me, your king,
a hearing before Parliament,
which is the lords
and commons assembled.
Sir, l submit you seek
only to delay the course
of justice.
By your favour, sir,
l seek only those rights
which, as your king,
I would grant to any
one of my subjects.
JUDGE:
Silence!
Sir, this court requires
to know if you have
anything to say
before judgement
is passed upon you.
I have nothing to say to you.
Then this court will
retire to judgement.
What ails thee?
Art thou mad?
Have we come thus far
that you would betray us now?
There is nothing in
the Constitution of
this land that entitles us
to bring a king to trial.
ls he not answerable to his subjects?
The trial is clearly
illegal, and l will have--
ls not the king
answerable to his subjects?
The king, sir,
is answerable only to God.
Then, by God,
when he dies, he shall
have much to answer for.
We have gone too far in this matter.
This commission has no authority--
MAN 1 : Our authority
lies with the Parliament, sir.
MAN 2:
Parliament is the law in this land.
lf the charges against
this king be not proven,
what terrible retribution
may he not bring down
upon our heads?
In the name of God!
What are we all?
Men?
Cowering and quivering
like downtrodden serfs.
The king is not England,
and England is not the king!
lt is not the survival of
the king that is at issue here.
It is the survival of England.
And this king,
by his dishonesties,
by his treasons,
and by his secret treaties
with foreign powers,
has shown himself
to be ill-fitted to govern
this great nation!
As God is my witness, Oliver,
I desire not the king's death,
but the settlement
of this nation in peace.
Do you think l don't desire that?
Go back to my farm and my family?
Very well. Go again
to this king.
Offer him once more
our terms.
Though God knows,
he should be well acquainted
with them by now.
Tell him he may sit
upon his throne,
but that this country will be
governed by Parliament,
and Parliament will be
elected by the people.
Now, Sir Thomas,
if you can achieve this
where we have failed,
this trial will end.
Here is a warrant
demanding the death
of the king
upon the charge of high
treason against this nation.
lt will require all your
signatures. Sir Thomas.
I have come thus far with you,
Oliver, in our great cause...
but I will not sign
this warrant.
Oliver, l cannot.
ls he guilty or not guilty?
He is the king.
ls he guilty?
Yes.
Sign it.
Charles Stuart,
king of England...
you have been found guilty
of high treason
against the good people
of this nation
represented in Parliament,
by whose authority
this court does sit
in judgement upon you.
Upon this charge, it is
the sentence of this court
that you be taken
hence to an...
appointed place
and put to death
by the severing of
the head from the body.
And that is the sentence
of the whole court.
[CROWD YELLING]
Remove the prisoner.
MAN: Silence.
Will you hear me a word, sir?
No, sir, you are not to
be heard after sentence.
By your favour, sir.
l know as much law
as any man here. l have
the right to be heard.
No, sir. Guard!
Remove your prisoner!
I demand to be heard!
I am your lawful king!
MAN:
Blood for the traitor!
General.
Sir Thomas.
I have been this past night
to the commissioners.
They have instructed me
to lay before you
this warrant
for 40,000 pounds
in return for
the king's life.
How little you know me
that you think you can
buy my principles.
You insult me with
that cheap bribe.
Will you not
think on it?
l have thought
on it. And well.
By my God,
l have thought on it.
PRIEST: ''Then the soldiers
of the governor took Jesus
into the common hall.
And they stripped him
and put on him a scarlet robe.
And when they had platted
a crown of thorns, they put it
upon his head.
And they bowed the knee
before him and mocked him
saying, 'Hail, king of the Jews!'
And they spit--''
Your Majesty.
ls it time?
No, Your Majesty.
Her Royal Highness,
the Princess Elizabeth,
and his Royal Highness,
Prince Henry.
Elizabeth, sweetheart.
Don't grieve for me.
Henry.
Now, both of you...
mark what I say.
They will cut off
thy father's head.
Shh, there now.
Henry, pay careful
attention to what l say.
You must not let them
make you king,
not while your brother
Charles is still alive.
I would be torn to pieces first.
That's my son.
Today, your brother
will be king.
Elizabeth, now.
It's a glorious death
to which I go.
Tell your mother...
that my love for her
was the same to the last.
And remember me
in your prayers.
The king's escort, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
God bless you both.
What kind of morning
is it, colonel?
Indeed it is somewhat
chilly, Your Majesty.
Then l was wise
to put on a second shirt.
For if l trembled with
the cold, my enemies
would say it was from fear.
I would not expose myself
to such a reproach.
Please keep them.
Oh, Your Majesty.
I do not fear death,
Sir Thomas.
lt is not at all
terrible to me.
l thank my God
l have prepared for it.
Are we to ride to
Westminster, or walk?
My orders are that
we walk, Your Majesty.
Admirable. The morning
air will do me good.
[BELL RlNGlNG]
[HORSE NElGHlNG]
MAN:
The king's coming.
He's coming now. The king's coming!
Hey, you. Stop him!
Gentlemen, the king comes.
MAN 1 : Traitor!
MAN 2: Execute him!
MAN 3: Execute him!
And a true, urgent sword in our hand.
God bless, Your Majesty.
God bless you.
Escort, halt!
[CROWD CHATTERING]
[CHATTERING STOPS]
Well, gentlemen, are you
afraid to kill your king
with an open face?
l will not delay you long,
but will say only this to you:
As God is my witness,
l have forgiven those
that have brought me here
and pray that my death
be not laid to their charge.
For I do endeavour,
even to the last,
to maintain the peace
of my kingdom.
I go now
from a corruptible
to an incorruptible crown.
To everlasting peace.
Will that suffice?
Permit me, sir,
that l may pray a while
before the blow is struck.
Then when I put out
my hands so:
That will be the sign.
Lord, let us now,
thy servant, depart in peace
according to thy word.
For mine eyes have seen thy
salvation which thou has prepared
before the face of all people.
Glory be to the Father
and to the Son and
to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning
is now and ever shall be.
Behold the head of a traitor!
[PEOPLE YELLING]
We did not assassinate.
Nor was this thing done
in a corner, it was done
in the face of God
and of all men.
The office of king
is now abolished.
Long live Parliament.
Long live the Republic.
MEN: Aye, long live the Republic.
Richard, l want to
go back to Cambridge.
Will you come with me, son?
lf you wish, Father.
lt will be peace
and quiet there now.
God knows, my soul
craves a little peace.
You must not
think on it, Oliver.
'Tis over now.
The war, everything.
'Tis over and done.
Oliver, you're home now.
There's nothing more
to think on.
Save that we two
may grow old
together in peace.
Peace.
Father.
Henry lreton is at
the house with some
men from Parliament.
I'll be along shortly.
Tom.
Arthur.
Henry.
Well, you all seem
solemn enough.
lt is a solemn business
that brings us here, Oliver.
Well, speak of it.
The country needs
a head of state, Oliver.
lt must be governed.
ls it not governed by Parliament?
There must be a figurehead.
lt is our tradition.
The country needs
a king, Oliver.
God knows, you've said
so many times yourself.
The country will be
ruled by Parliament.
Now, in the name of Christ,
how often must I say that?
And who will control Parliament?
The people, the people, the people!
lt's not practical. lt won't work.
lt will work and it must work.
We are here, on behalf
of Parliament, to offer
you the Crown.
To offer...
Me, king of England?
King Oliver I of England.
Elizabeth, tell me,
do you see before
you a king?
This tired, sickening man,
this country oaf,
crude in speech
and manner?
This rough fellow,
does he display
the bearing of a king?
You are the one man
who can govern this country.
In the name of God,
did we cut the head off this king
only to steal his Crown?
This hollow golden ring,
this worthless trinket.
Give it to a whore
for the price of her bed!
If you would find a head to fit it,
let it adorn some court jester
or some strolling player
that he may play your king,
but not l.
Power must be absolute,
or it be no power at all.
lt was not for power that
we did this thing. Have you
not understood that yet?
Now, Ireton, mark me,
and mark me well.
That you be hard-set
upon ambitious courses
has not escaped me,
and if you seek to use me
towards such ends,
though l love you
like a brother, l swear,
l will destroy you.
Every freeborn Englishman,
be he the lowest of the lowest,
is entitled to a voice
in the governing
of this country.
But there is no vote
for the poor, for the
underprivileged,
no vote for all those
who took up arms
to put down the very autocracy
that this Parliament
now imposes upon us.
You did not vote
this Parliament into office.
This gaggle of buffoons,
these villains!
Much has been said
in this House about
the so-called inequity
of certain members
being financially involved
in national projects.
Members have ascribed
to this state of affairs dark
and sinister motives.
I say if we in Parliament
cannot gain from ruling
the country,
there's really very little point
in our being here at all.
MAN: No member of this
House should be permitted
to profit from his office.
MEN:
Hear! Hear!
MAN: lf this House knew
its duty to the nation,
it would terminate its sitting
and let a new Parliament
be elected.
SPEAKER: Order!
Gentlemen, l move that this House
be given power to remain
in office a further three
years without re-election.
[CHEERING]
In my opinion, a committee
of inquiry should be set up
to investigate
the financial involvement
of certain members.
SPEAKER:
Order!
Mr. Speaker. May I have
your permission to
address this assembly?
By all means, sir.
My lords,
honourable members,
l have always desired,
above my life, a free Parliament
sitting by the authority
of the good people
of this nation.
A Parliament open
and visible, to be seen
by all men.
lt is six years since
l handed over to you
this great responsibility
in the hope that you would make
good and wholesome laws
which the people of this nation
expected of you.
I must confess to some
abatement of my hopes
for what has happened
in my absence.
Instead of uniting the good
people of this nation
with righteousness
and peace,
which would have been
a glorious and Christian
thing to have done,
what do I find?
Anarchy, corruption,
division and dissatisfaction.
I say that the enemies
of this nation
have flourished
under your protection.
You were from the beginning
a provisional government
not truly representative
of the people.
For have the people
elected you?
Has this House gone once
to the people it purports
to represent?
No, it has not! And after
six years of misgovernment,
what do we find?
Sir Thomas Fairfax moves
a bill to give this House
a further lease
of its worthless
and dishonourable life!
Gentlemen, an immovable
Parliament is more obnoxious
than an immovable king!
You are drunkards, tricksters,
villains, whoremasters,
godless, self-seeking,
ambitious tricksters.
You are no more capable
of conducting the affairs
of this nation
than you are
of running a brothel!
[MEN YELL]
You are scum, sir,
and not truly elected
scum at that.
This is no Parliament.
I shall put an end
to your sitting.
l hereby declare this
Parliament dissolved!
Colonel Harrison!
Yes, sir. Troops forward!
Rubbish.
Remove them!
Come on, get them out.
This is dictatorship,
sir! Dictatorship!
Dictator!
Dictatorship!
MAN: This is illegal!
Come, sir.
l refuse to quit this chair.
By your leave, sir.
Away with this bauble!
I seem to recall
that we cut off
a king's head
for such as this.
You are a traitor, sir.
lt is the likes of you who
have turned my hand to this.
l have sought
the Lord's guidance night
and day in this matter.
lt is not idly done,
for this nation will
be justly governed.
I will give this nation back
its self-respect.
We will walk in this world
with our heads held high.
l will liberate man's souls
from the darkness of ignorance.
l will build schools
and universities for all.
This will become
the golden age of learning.
l will bring the law
within the reach of
every common man.
There'll be work
and bread for all.
This nation will prosper
because it is a godly nation
and because we walk
hand in hand with the Lord.
I swear by the name
of the living God
that I will see this nation
properly governed
if I have to do it myself.
Dear God, give me
the strength to do it...
alone.
NARRATOR: Oliver Cromwell
ruled the nation as lord protector
for five years.
In that short time,
he raised England
to be a great power,
feared and respected
throughout the world.
Under his hand
were laid the foundations
of a truly democratic nation.
In 1658, he died.
Three years later, Charles,
prince of Wales, was crowned king
and a monarch sat once more
upon the throne of England.
But an England
never to be the same again.
