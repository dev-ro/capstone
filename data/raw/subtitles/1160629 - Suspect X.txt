Turning to the cruiser ship explosion
that killed a medical school director...
Coast Guard examiners have found
no evidence of a bomb onboard.
Examiners believe the explosion may
have been caused by a freak accident.
But several weeks ago,
the director had received a death threat.
Could someone have fired
on the boat from shore?
That would be physically difficult.
Sinking a boat that size...
would require a large
military weapon of some kind.
It would leave definite tracks.
And it could easily be traced.
I find it highly unlikely.
"Unlikely"?
There is an explanation to everything.
Take this simple experiment
using a Gaussian acceleration device.
A steel ball rolls along a rail,
striking a row of stationary balls.
As you can see,
the last ball is pushed away...
at the same speed as the striking ball.
The law of energy and
momentum conservation.
But now let's add to the rail
a powerful neodymium magnet.
Watch.
Prior to impact...
the rolled ball receives
instant acceleration from the magnet.
That speed gets transferred
to the ball at the end.
What would happen if we multiplied
the magnet's strength by many times?
The ball at the end would become
a high-speed projectile.
In short, this tiny steel ball...
would become a rifle bullet.
A superconducting accelerator.
Let's harness the power of a
super-conducting magnet.
Stand by!
Right.
Extinguish!
I'm guessing the perpetrator used
a device like this to sink the boat.
But who could build such a device?
Super-conducting magnets are found
in large MRI and CT scan equipment.
Umeyashiki Medical Systems?
They do have a research facility
near the Haneda coast.
How did you know?
Electromagnetic noise.
There were reports in the area
from local residents...
of clocks stopping and
disrupted TV signals.
Evidence of a magnetic field
generated near the lab.
So the death threat
was from someone at Umeyashiki?
That's for you police to answer.
I've no interest in that.
Yeah, yeah.
You're only interested
in how it happened, right?
Precisely.
Now go lead your investigation.
Wise guy.
I bet you're clueless when it comes
to questions science can't answer.
Such as?
Such as...
love.
Love?
Yes, that is irrationality at its best.
Why don't we insert it into an equation?
ax² + bx + c = "love"
Can't be solved.
No kidding.
The area of a triangle?
Base x height / "love".
Or a circle would be radius² x "love"?
Very funny.
"Love" is a construct, therefore...
Forget I asked. It was a waste of time.
Precisely.

Hurry and get up, Misato!
You'll be late!
I know.
I'm going. Don't forget to lock up.
Okay.
See you later.
Bye.
Don't skip breakfast.
< SUSPECT X >
Thank you. Come again!
Good morning.
Lunch special.
One special!
600 yen exactly.
Thank you, as always.
Here you go!
It's getting cold out.
Man, it's cold!
Morning!
Winter's here.
Thanks for waiting.
Early bird special!
Have a good day!
Misato?
Don't you have a key?
Ow, ow, ow!
Surprise!
How'd you?
Can't hide from your ex-husband.
Get out!
Brought your favorite cake.
I'll call the police.
I found work.
I'll work hard this time.
Let's give it another shot.
No way.
Now leave.
I saw your shop.
Congrats. That was your dream.
Hostess savings?
None of your business.
I beg you to leave.
Honey...
Don't touch me!
I'm home!
Hi, Misato!
To your room.
Show some manners!
Lower your voice!
Bad attitude.
Just leave us alone.
How rude.
Fine.
I'm going.
What're you doing?
Saying hello to my daughter. Hey, Misato!
She's not your daughter.
She'll be a beaut.
Get her working at a
night club in a few years.
You'll never shake me.
Stop trying.
Misato!
What did you do? Give me that!
Misato!
Let go!
That wasn't smart, was it?
You wanna die, kid?
Is that what you want?
Stop it!
Get up! Let me see your face!
Run, Misato!
Move!
Come here.
No!
Stop it!
Oh my God...
what've we done?
Misato, get in your room. Quickly.
Who is it?
Ishigami, from next door.
Just a minute!
I'll be right there!
Is everything okay?
Were we noisy?
I'm sorry... a cockroach.
My daughter and I...
Killed him?
The roach.
Yes. We're fine now.
I'm really sorry.
Ms. Hanaoka...
it wasn't a roach.
Media got here fast.
Brass has arrived.
Sir!
Chief Kusanagi!
How've you been, Utsumi?
Are you heading this?
Yup. This here's Sgt. Kakimoto.
Utsumi... Kaizuka Precinct.
Who found him?
Kids playing baseball.
Effects?
Nothing yet.
That bike could be his.
Probably stolen.
And that?
His clothes were burned.
Coroner?
Arrived 30 minutes ago.
Who's handling the media?
That bird's a nuisance.
I'm cold just looking at him.
Heat pad.
You sure?
I've more.
You come prepared.
Prints were burned?
Yes.
Face is crushed, too.
Just great.
Forget dental records.
It'll take time.
Victim's name...
Shinji Togashi, 39, unemployed.
From Hamamatsu City.
Blood type: A.
Time of death...
between 6 and 10 p.m., Dec. 2nd.
Currently lives in Kawasaki City.
Behind in his rent,
he's been staying in boarding houses.
How'd you identify him so quickly?
The day he went missing,
he was at an inn in Ota Ward.
The proprietor filed
a stolen items report.
He wasn't in his room.
I hate having keys stolen.
Quiet!
DNA from hair in the
room matches the victim's.
Prints also match those
found on the stolen bicycle.
We can assume the body
is that of Shinji Togashi.
What about the weapon? Crime Lab?
It's been identified.
He was strangled to death.
No vital signs.
Post-mortem damage.
Cervix.
Deep markings from twined rope cord.
Just like the one you have here.
Heater table cord.
Next, Togashi's associations.
Investigation team?
Yes!
Investigation!
The victim was married.
6 years ago to a bar hostess.
They divorced after 2 years.
Ex-wife is Yasuko Hanaoka, 35.
She has a teenage daughter.
No relation to the victim.
She runs a box lunch shop
called "Misato" in Hamacho.
Yasuko Hanaoka's residence?
Yes.
Do you know a Shinji Togashi?
Had you seen him recently?
No, we never spoke.
Thank you.
Were you home the night of Dec. 2nd?
December 2nd?
Several days before his death,
Mr. Togashi showed up at the club...
where you used to work.
He left with your shop address.
Did he visit you there?
No.
Nor here?
No.
Where were you the eve of Dec. 2nd?
Let's see.
We went to a movie.
I met my daughter after work.
Misato, right?
What theater?
The Scala in Hibiya.
After that?
We ate dinner and went to a karaoke box.
Different kind of heater cord.
She has an alibi, too.
I don't buy it.
A movie and karaoke on a week night?
Good point.
What's more...
she's pretty.
What?
Excuse us.
Know this man?
No.
This your usual return time?
Usually but...
not when classes end early.
Classes?
I'm a high school math teacher.
"Ishigami". Unusual name.
If you'll excuse me.
What time did you return
last Tuesday, Dec. 2nd?
"Teito University"
I'd say I was home by 7.
Hear anything next door?
Next door?
Like a visitor.
No, I didn't.
I see.
Thank you for your time.
Hello?
It's Ishigami.
Yes?
The police came, right?
Yes.
That was quick, wasn't it?
Don't worry. That's expected.
Just respond without emotion.
Okay.
Don't show them movie
stubs unless they ask.
Where are they now?
In a drawer.
Stick them in the film program.
Not a drawer, but the program.
Okay.
From now on, I'll call
only from a public phone.
They might tap mine.
Yes.
Um...
Yes?
Mr. Ishigami?
Are you sure this is
the right thing to do?
Yes, I'm sure.
Logic is on our side.
What is logic?
When Einstein posited
his particle theory of light...
he added logical beauty
to Planck's constant.
As usual, lots of girls.
Cretin.
Obviously, logical thinking
demands calm analysis.
Going on "impulse" or "hunches"
will lead you astray.
Get that?
Who, me?
I don't always go on hunches.
What brings you here?
We were just passing by.
I think logically, too.
Not here for my help?
Don't flatter yourself. We manage fine.
Actually, yeah.
See the news about the body
with the pulverized face?
Our lead suspect has a strong alibi.
So we're stuck.
It happens sometimes.
No, it doesn't.
Okay, it doesn't. Help us.
No thanks.
There's no science in a strong alibi.
There might be. A person can't
be in two places at the same time.
Explain that.
The suspect's a real beauty.
Want some coffee?
Where's the cable?
I gave it to you!
No, you didn't.
Nitrogen coming through.
We're ready, Professor!
What's the beauty's alibi?
That she was at a movie
in Hibiya the time of the crime.
With her daughter.
Professor Yukawa, we're ready.
Then dinner and karaoke afterwards.
Staff at both places corroborate.
At issue is the theater, then.
This beauty...
What's with your "beauty" trip?
It's important. She is, right?
Frail but sexy.
Whatever.
Any proof this frail
but sexy beauty was at the movies?
She had some.
I bought a film program.
May I see it?
Sorry for intruding again.
Ticket stubs would help, too.
- Ticket stubs?
- Yes.
"Little Santa... Dec. 2, 7 p.m."
She's innocent. Why doubt her?
A cop's hunch.
Aha! An illogical and groundless hunch!
And then you say
she had to be in two places at once.
Well, that's impossible.
Indeed.
In 1854, a Latvian teacher named
Emilie Sagee split in two during class.
What?
Students were shocked to see
two Emilys writing on the blackboard.
No way.
It's called a "doppelganger"
or "bilocation" phenomenon.
There've been many reports.
By occult freaks.
Can't happen. There's always a reason.
But alas, not one by physicists.
Right! Having ticket stubs
doesn't put her in the theater.
She could've left early.
Or bought the tickets in the day.
We know that!
But if that beauty is the culprit,
you're in for a hard time.
How so?
An average person wouldn't think about
where best to store ticket stubs.
If she did that to strengthen her alibi,
you're up against a strong mind.
And an interesting one.
Okay, lab time, Professor.
It's the job of cops,
not physicists, to solve crimes.
I enjoyed it, though. Good luck.
By the way...
her next-door-neighbor is an
alum of ours. Maybe you know him.
So what? Hurry, Professor.
Ishigami, was it?
Ishigami?
Professor!
Tetsuya Ishigami?
You know him?
I don't use the word "genius" lightly.
But Ishigami is one.
Really?
How is he?
He seemed aloof and antisocial.
He's only interested in math.
Math?
Yes, math.
It's not a hard derivative.
It just takes a little
creative substitution for alpha.
The police came to Misato's school...
asking about the movie plot.
I'm sure she did fine. Don't worry.
If she followed my directions.
Mr. Ishigami?
Yes?
Why are you helping us?
That man made you suffer, right?
Yes, but...
I'd hate it if I could no
longer buy your lunches.
Yes?
Thank you... very much.
I'll call tomorrow.
Yes.
Amazing, huh?
It's going just like he said.
Let's eat.
Still passionate about math, I see.
Our staff doesn't even
have material like this.
Please, over here.
Sit anywhere.
Take a cushion.
Thanks.
You can move that.
A friend, you say?
"Bento Misato"
Who gave you my address?
A cop who talked to you.
He's an alum, too.
Oh, I see.
This is all I got.
It's been 17 years.
What high schooler could solve
the Four Color theorem?
Wasted breath.
Yet nothing could be more fascinating.
Absolutely.
Why high school math?
Hits the spot.
I thought you'd stay and do research.
I planned to.
But my mom was bedridden.
I had to leave the university.
I see.
But math research can be done anywhere.
True.
Still climbing?
Occasionally.
Mountain climbing is like math.
One summit.
The trick is to find the simplest,
most logical route to it.
And math has many peaks to be conquered.
Hodge Conjecture,
Yang Mills Theory and the Mass Gap...
the P not = NP Problem.
- The Riemann Hypothesis, huh?
- That's from the Math Dept.
This tries to disprove it.
I'd like you to assess the proof.
This'll take some time.
I can wait.
Don't forget breakfast, Misato.
I won't.
Bye.
Still working on it?
I figured it out.
Sadly, this refutation is flawed.
Prime number distribution.
Admirable try, though.
Just six hours.
The genius has still got it.
I'm glad.
I hear your neighbor's a murder suspect.
Seems so.
You friendly?
No, we just exchange greetings.
I buy lunch from her shop.
Too bad. I hear she's pretty.
Interesting route to work.
The scenery never changes.
Their lives are like clockwork.
Freed from the clock,
humans live more regulated lives.
Interesting.
Yukawa...
how do you stay so young?
I envy that.
That doesn't sound like you.
Sorry I couldn't be a better host.
You kidding? It was great.
- Take care.
- Take care.
What's taking so long to get her?
She's our perp, right?
Still missing key evidence. Sorry.
It's Kusanagi's weakness
for pretty women.
Yoo-hoo! Hey, Miss!
Utsumi.
Coffee, please.
We're looking into a possible accomplice.
She may have acted alone in the killing,
but not the cover-up.
As a former hostess,
she's doubtless known enough men.
Watch it, or you might upset
the nation's hostess union.
"From Manabu Yukawa.
Meet me where the body was found."
Meet me where the body was found.
What kind of batting stroke is that?
Hit with your gut.
When the pitch comes,
coil your gut and release!
Totally illogical.
By "gut", you mean
generating subumbilical...
Professor?
Well, good luck.
What took you?
I work too, you know.
Where was the body found?
So why the sudden interest in this case?
What's your rundown of the murder?
Ms. Hanaoka...
"the suspect" was
meeting the victim here.
The victim came here by stolen bicycle...
and was murdered.
Why assume a bicycle?
It had his prints all over it.
Why were prints on it?
I don't know.
Wouldn't the killer
try to wipe them away?
She was flustered.
But she wasn't too flustered
to burn his clothes and fingers.
What're you driving at?
That the killer intentionally
left prints on the bike.
For what purpose?
To make it look like the victim
came by bicycle, and was killed here.
Wait a second.
So Togashi was killed
elsewhere and brought here?
The bike was stolen here
that day between 4 and 11 p.m.
Why that time frame?
The owner reported it stolen.
A report?
The owner says she tied the bicycle here.
Why choose that particular bike?
Lots of bikes aren't locked up.
This one, for instance.
Want my hypothesis?
That bike was brand new, was it not?
Why target a new bicycle?
To ensure it'd be reported stolen.
That would be convenient to the killer.
Convenient how?
I have no idea.
What's up?
I was musing what to eat,
and remembered your box lunch place.
So you came all this way?
When I get an idea in my
head, I can't let it go.
Hello.
Hello.
It's cold.
Still teach differential equations?
Not anymore.
Physics students could really use it.
Math students, too.
Thank you.
Welcome!
Afternoon.
Afternoon.
What do you recommend?
What's his usual order?
Mr. Ishigami gets the lunch special.
Really?
Then so will I.
One special!
They all look great.
I can see why you come every day.
Hello!
Welcome!
Long time, no see.
Mr. Kudo.
You look well, Yasuko.
I heard you opened a shop,
and figured I'd help boost sales.
Thank you. What a surprise.
Lunch special!
So you're the boss.
Excuse me.
Your special.
Here you go.
600 yen exactly.
Shall we go?
Thank you.
You haven't changed a bit!
I'll eat this at home.
You're going to take that
on the train with you?
Call me eccentric.
I'll part ways here.
Thanks for your company.
Ishigami?
I've a challenge for you.
A new math problem.
Which is more difficult?
Inventing an unsolvable problem...
Or solving one.
And there is an answer.
Intriguing. I'll think on it.
I hope you will.
Sorry for surprising you today.
Yukawa's a classmate from college.
He's a very smart man.
Be careful with him.
Understood.
Um...
Yes?
That customer that came
into the shop today...
Oh, an old acquaintance.
He helped me out once.
Why? What's wrong?
Nothing. Never mind.
We need to play our next card
to stay ahead of Yukawa.
Our next card?
Put Misato on the line.
Misato... it's Mr. Ishigami.
Hello?
What friend did you run into that night?
Kurumi... Kurumi Morino.
You haven't told the police that, right?
No, you told me not to.
Okay, then listen carefully.
Professor Yukawa?
What're you doing?
Burning old reports.
I don't trust the shredder.
Did you find out something?
Like what?
You went to her shop.
Just to buy lunch.
Ishigami told me it's good.
Don't be cute.
You suspect her, right?
No comment.
I'm doing this out of interest,
not to help the police.
- I've been feeding you info!
- Please go.
Or arrest me for obstruction.
What's his problem?
Personal interest?
Dr. "Galileo" Yukawa?
Says he's not helping the police.
I don't get it.
I do.
Personal interest, right?
She's pretty.
I don't think that's it.
It's all about that.
I bet a lot of regular customers
go just to see her.
A lot of cops come here
as an excuse to see me.
Regular customer.
Yum, this is addictive.
You're investigating the math teacher.
You're not getting my help.
He goes to that shop.
It stands to reason that he likes her.
That would give him a motive to help her.
She has other regular customers.
And Ishigami has no alibi for Dec. 2nd.
Not conclusive evidence.
There's more.
Like you said,
the culprit has to be extremely smart.
He's a "genius", right?
Shinji Togashi's killer...
is most likely Yasuko Hanaoka.
And Ishigami helped?
No, he's not directly
involved in the murder.
Not involved?
By the time he came along,
Togashi was already dead.
How can you be so sure?
If she had sought his help,
he'd have devised another plan.
He wouldn't choose murder.
He's not capable of it?
He wouldn't find murder
a logical solution.
He's no fool.
Once he learned of the murder,
he could help by covering evidence.
He could devise ways
to throw off the police.
Give Yasuko an alibi and instruct her.
Like when to provide evidence,
how to respond to police.
I bought a film program.
Ishigami created her alibi?
And left prints on the bike,
as well as clothing unburned.
