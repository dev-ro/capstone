Shh shh shh.
This is a story
from long ago...
when the great mammoths
still roamed our lands.
It's the story
of my two brothers and me.
When the three of us
were young...
we were taught that
the world is full of magic.
The source of this magic...
is the everchanging lights
that dance across the sky.
The shaman woman
of our village told us...
that these lights are
the spirits of our ancestors...
and that they have the power
to make changes in our world.
Small things become big.
Winter turns to spring.
One thing
always changes into another.
But the greatest change
I ever saw...
was that of my brother...
a boy who desperately
wanted to be...a man.
-Get down!
-What?
Get down - get down!
Kenai!
Aah! Uhh! Whoo!
Uhh!
Never try to milk a caribou.
Uhh!
No, no. Don't, don't.
No. Come on, don't. No, no, no.
Hey, will you two knock it off?
That's all right, Sitka.
After today, he won't treat me
like that anymore.
Oh, right--
the big manhood ceremony.
It doesn't matter
what the spirits say.
You'll always be
our baby brother.
Oh, yeah?
Well, wait until I get my totem.
-Baby brother.
-Aah!
Hey, I said knock it off.
Now, the quicker
we get these fish...
the faster we're going
to get to your ceremony...
so let's all just try
and get along for a few hours.
-OK, Denahi?
-Whatever you say.
-OK, Ke--
-So, what are we waiting for?
Aw--
Uhh.
-Whoo!
-Whoo!
Uhh!
Whoo! Ha ha ha!
Ooh!
-Yay! Kenai's back!
-Kenai!
Kenai , are you excited about
getting your spirit rock today?
It's not a rock.
It'll be my totem.
Ooh.
Yeah, I'll probably get,
like, a sabertooth tiger...
for bravery or strength
or greatness.
You know,
something that fits me.
How about a mammoth
for your fat head?
Just make sure
you get that basket tied up.
Don't worry.
No stupid bear is going to get
anywhere near this fish.
Just tie it up.
Just tie it up.
She's back!
Hey, everybody, Tanana's back!
Come on!
Come on, Kenai, let's go!
Come on, come on.
Tanana's got your rock!
Come on!
-Tanana.
-What?
-Tanana.
-What?
Tanana. Ha ha ha!
Well , hello there, sweetheart.
What a big girl.
When each of us comes of age...
the great spirits
reveal to us...
a totem that helps guide us
through our lives.
Some of us use courage
to guide us.
Ha ha.
Others, patience.
And some of us, beauty.
Kenai...
you nervous?
Whew. Excited.
Ooh, you should be.
It's a good one.
Kenai,
I have been to the mountain...
where the lights
touch the earth...
and the great spirits have
revealed to me your totem.
To become a man, your actions
must be guided by one thing.
Your totem is...
Love.
-What?
-Yes, love.
The bear of love?
A love that connects and unites
all living things.
-Who wants to trade?
-There is no trading!
Uh, Kenai...
Love is the most precious
of totems.
It reveals itself
in unexpected ways.
Let love guide your actions.
Then one day, you'll be a man...
and will place your mark
next to those of our ancestors.
and will place your mark
next to those of our ancestors.
Yeah!
Oh...
-There he is.
-Ohh.
Ha ha! Come here, loverboy.
-Uhh. Leave me alone.
-Aw, Kenai, wait.
-Uhh.
-I'm sorry.
What?
Your totem--
I think it's really great.
-You do?
-Yeah.
-And I made you something.
-Really?
Now when you skip around
loving everybody...
you'll smell so sweet.
-Ugh. Uhh!
-Well, isn't this nice?
Instead of fighting, you're
giving each other flowers.
Yeah, isn't it lovely?
He's so in touch
with his totem already.
Uhh!
Hey, dog breath,
go take care of the fish.
Sure.
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Kenai.
Someday, I'm going to just...
He's just such a--
Hey, bonehead, just because
his totem is wisdom...
doesn't mean he's wise.
I mean, look at him.
Kenai loves me, he loves me not.
Hey! Whoa!
Hi, Denahi.
Oh, hi. Ha ha.
-Aah!
-Ooh.
-Let go!
-Yeah...
I guess the spirits messed up
on both of our totems.
You know, I felt the same way
when Tanana gave me mine.
-Get out of here.
-No, really.
I said, "the eagle of guidance?"
What does that mean?
Ha ha.
But now that I'm older...
I know it's about
being a leader...
and keeping an eye on you two.
I just want to get
my handprint on that wall.
Just be patient, Kenai.
When you live by your totem,
you will.
-Really?
-Guarantee it.
-Really?
-Guarantee it.
But, come on. The bear of love?
I mean,
a bear doesn't love anyone.
They don't think. They don't
feel. I mean, they're--
They're thieves.
You didn't tie it off, did you?
Uh...
You should've got
the totem of pinheads.
Knock it off.
We'll just make another basket.
We? Oh, no.
No. It took me two weeks
to make that basket.
You get loverboy to do it.
He's the one that's
messing things up all the time.
Typical Kenai.
All right.
I'll go get your basket.
Kenai, wait. Kenai!
What?
Uhh. Unh! Unh!
Unh!
Kenai!
Kenai!
-Where'd he go?
-lf we're lucky, far away.
Huh.
Aah!
Uhh!
Kenai!
Kenai!
Sitka, no!
You got to get out of here!
-What?
-The bear!
-Look behind you!
-Aah!
Hey, bear, come on! Over here!
Come on, bear! Come this way!
Uhh.
Aah!
Denahi! Uhh! Hold on!
Come on, pull!
Uhh!
Unh!
Aah! Uhh!
Sitka.
Sitka!
Sitka?
Come on!
-Sitka!
-Sitka!
-Sitka. Sitka!
-Sitka!
Sitka, where are you?
Kenai!
No.
Sitka!
Sitka!
Help us find you!
Sitka!
Sitka, where are you?
Sitka!
-You ready?
-For what?
We're going after the bear.
I know what you're feeling,
but killing that bear is wrong.
Wrong?
Our brother is dead, and
it's because of that monster.
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.
I see.
Killing that bear
won't make you a man.
Oh, now you're trying
to be wise.
I'm trying to follow my totem.
Why can't you do the same?
You really think love has
anything to do with being a man?
A man wouldn't just sit here
and do nothing.
Kenai.
Don't upset the spirits.
Spirits.
Thanks for your wisdom.
I've got to stop him.
You left too soon, Sitka.
Your brothers
need your guidance.
Ha.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah! Aah!
Kenai.
Uhh.
Aah!
What?
Sitka?
Unh! Ooh!
Uhh! Oh!
Uhh! Unh!
Unh!
No.
I don't blame the bear, Kenai.
A man wouldn't just
sit here and do nothing.
Uhh.
So, Kenai, you've decided
to join the living.
Whoo, that's quite a bump
you've got there.
That must've been one heck of
a ride down those rapids, huh?
Tanana?
Uhh. Ohh.
Ooh.
Nana, you won't believe this.
I was at the top
of this huge rock...
and all of the sudden, this--
Kenai, honey,
shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
I don't speak bear.
Huh?
No.
No, no! No!
Aah!
All right, all right.
Aah! Will you settle down?
-Kenai!
-Oof!
Kenai. Kenai, Kenai.
This isn't going to work.
Kenai, listen to me.
Sitka did this.
Hmm. Strange.
Spirits don't usually make
these kind of changes.
Oh. Oh, my, my, my.
Sitka must have something
really big planned for you.
Yep, yep, yep.
You're going to get a whole new
perspective on things.
Oh. Do you see
in black and white or color?
Hey, listen to me.
You got yourself into this mess.
If you want to change, take it
up with your brother's spirit.
You'll find him
on the mountain...
where the lights
touch the earth.
He'll help you make up
for what you've done wrong.
But I didn't do anything wrong.
Tanana?
Tanana! W-wait!
I didn't do anything wrong!
I don't even know
how to get there.
What happened to them?
I don't know.
Well, they were
right here a second ago...
and now they're gone.
Yeah.
That's pretty weird, huh?
So, you're telling me...
you didn't eat them , and
you have no idea where they are?
-Uh-uh.
-Hey, hey, you.
You just talked.
J-just back away...
real slow-like.
How'd you do that?
-Aah!
-Aah!
Are we there yet?
Don't make me
turn this formation around.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Come back!
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Come back!
I'm trying to find
where the lights--
What's he getting
all worked up about, eh?
Gee, I don't know. Maybe
the gulls pooped on him, eh?
Oh, gee, I think
he's looking over here.
-Let's beat it. This way.
-No, no, no, this way.
Aw...
-Thank you very much.
-OK, just stay still, eh.
Hey, you two.
Head down, head down.
Oh, gee, I think
he's seen us, eh. Now what?
Act like we're not here.
-Oh, we're not here.
-Shh! What are you doing, eh?
-Well, you said to tell--
-Don't say anything. Shh.
-OK.
-I said don't say anything.
-Um, excuse me.
-Aah!
-Please, don't eat us!
-You wouldn't like us, eh.
We're really gamy.
Yeah.
Eat hoof-for-brains over there.
Oh, nice, eh, pine-cone breath.
-Crusty tail.
-Twig legs.
-Sorry.
-You went too far that time.
-OK, I'm sorry.
-Guys.
Besides,
yours is bigger than mine.
I'm not eating anybody.
-Oh.
-Whew!
That's mighty decent of you, eh.
Yeah. Hey, my name's Rutt.
This is my brother Tuke.
How's it going, bear?
Don't call me that.
Sorry, uh, uh, Mr. Bear?
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.
I hate bears.
Well, gee, eh?
You're one big beaver.
No kiddin', eh?
Do either of you know where
the lights touch the earth?
Y-y-y-y-yeah...
No. Uh, no.
Sorry, bear. Or beaver.
I'm not a beaver.
I'm--I'm a bear.
No, I mean, I'm not a bear.
I'm a man.
-Excuse me?
-Ha ha ha.
I was transformed
into a bear magically.
I--I was lifted into the sky
by my brother.
Uh-huh...
You're crazy!
Gesundheit.
No, a fruitcake!
Are you OK?
No! That bear...
over there! He's crazy!
I am not crazy!
Well, who ever said you were?
-We understand.
-You do?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, you see,
we're not moose, either.
-We're--we're not?
-No. Heh.
We're like, uh...
we're like squirrels. Yeah.
Oh. Oh, yeah. Beauty, eh?
Yeah, well, he--he's actually
the squirrel, eh?
I'm more of
a pure-bred wolverine.
Look at these cuspids.
Rrrrraahh!
Give him a little room.
Uhh. Why am I even talking
to a couple of dumb moose?
No, we're squirrels, eh?
Wolverine.
I'll find it myself.
-Oh, I wouldn't go that way.
-Why not, eh?
Uh, well...there was a reason.
You brought it up.
I'm trying to,
but you're talking--
Aah! Uhh! Ow! Uhh!
Aah! Unh! Ow!
So, you think of it yet?
Uh, no, but it's
drivin' me nuts, too, eh?
Ow.
Uhh.
Psst. Hey.
-Is the coast clear?
-What?
Are there any hunters around?
Uh, no.
-Aw, good!
-Aah!
How you doin'? Guess you didn't
see the trap, huh?
I saw it from a mile away.
Ha ha.
You must be pretty embarrassed.
Don't worry.
I won't tell anyone.
What?
You need to get down.
Let me help.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
-Ow!
-Hold still!
No, just--ow! Stop that!
Uhh! If you just--ow!
Give me--Stop it! Uhh!
It's no use.
The only way to get down
is to chew your own foot off.
I don't need
some stupid bear's help.
I just need the stick.
-OK, here.
-No, no, no.
I'll do it myself. Put it back.
No, where you found it.
-Oh.
-To the left.
By the little rock.
-Here?
-Yes!
OK.
Boy, that tree is strong, huh?
You know, when I was little...
I was really into climbin'
trees--all kinds of trees.
I climbed pine trees,
oak trees, fig trees...
maple trees, uh, birch trees,
willow trees...
My eyes were watering,
and my tongue was swollen...
and from that moment on, I was
more careful about what I lick.
Ha! Ha. See?
It's all about--uhh--
using your head.
Ohh! Uhh!
Ooh! That was funny!
Do it again!
Don't you have someplace to go?
-Yeah, the salmon run.
-Uhh.
Hmm. How about this?
I get you down,
then we go together. Deal?
Yeah, OK, fine. If you can
magically get me down...
I'll go with you to this--this--
-Salmon run.
-Whatever.
But if you can't...
you turn around, walk away,
and never come back...ever.
-You swear?
-Yeah.
-Pinky swear.
-Yeah, sure, fine. Pinky swear.
But this is a human trap, and
you're just a dumb little bear.
So there's really no way
you're gonna be able to--
Whaaah!
Whaaah!
Uhh!
OK, so, what I'm thinking is...
we travel by day
and sleep by night.
My bedtime is an hour after
sunset. Or I think--
Run!
Yeah, good riddance!
Uhh.
Denahi? Denahi, you found me!
You wouldn't believe
what a nightmare this has been!
Denahi? It--it's me--Kenai!
Aah! Aah!
Is he gone?
-I think he was going--
-Shh!
Whew.
Hello? I can't breathe.
Why is he chasing me?
That's what they do.
But it's not like him.
Yeah, well, lucky for him
he didn't find us...
'cause when I get into a fight,
I go all crazy...
and I'm a raging ball
of brown fur.
Uhh!
I mean, I don't want to brag or
nothin', but I got some moves.
-Oh, really?
-Yep.
This first one--well, it's just
a little thing...
I like to call...
"The Slasher"!
And this one I like to call
"Flying Fury of Death"!
Uh-huh.
-He's coming back!
-Where?
Typical.
Ha ha. Yeah, well, the next time
we run into that hunter--
There is no "we," OK? I'm not
taking you to any salmon run.
What?! But you pinky swore.
Yeah, well, things change.
See ya, kid.
Um...
Wait. Uh...
The truth is...
I got separated from my mom...
and now
with this hunter around...
Kid, I got my own problems.
Come on. Please?
Can't we just go together?
There's a lot of bears
and a ton of fish...
and every night
we watch the lights...
touch the mountain,
and last year--
Wait, wait,
what'd you just say?
There's lots of bears
and tons of fish.
No. You know where
the lights touch the earth?
Yeah, it's at the top
of the mountain...
right by the salmon run.
You're kidding me.
No, no.
They're practically next door.
Come on, I'll show you.
It'll be great.
I promise to help you escape
from every trap you walk into.
I'm not gonna walk
into any more--uhh!--traps.
Come on.
What do you say?
You're sure you can take me...
to where
the lights touch the earth?
Yeah, no problem.
If you slow me down--
I won't. I promise.
All right.
We leave first thing tomorrow.
Phew.
And keep all that cuddly bear
stuff to a minimum, OK, kid?
My name's not kid. It's Koda.
-What's your name?
-Ohh...
Good day.
Hey, how's it goin', eh?
-Beauty.
-Beauty.
Oh, so, we got a lot
to get done today.
You want to get started?
Yeah, just give me one sec, eh?
OK.
Whoo-oo-oo.
Could you just
help me crack this?
Oh, yeah.
-Uhh.
-You ready now?
-Uh, almost.
-Oh, jeez.
Just want to do, uh,
dog facing forward.
-Oh, come on!
-Uhh! Good. OK.
And...go!
Mm...mmm!
This is a nice patch here.
Oh, gee. Don't--don't--
don't go near this patch here.
Somethin' went here.
Hmm.
Ahh...
Skinny, fat, skinny, fat...
Hey, I've got a mountain
to get to. Come on, kid.
I told you before,
my name's Koda.
Say it with me. Ko...da.
Sure your mom didn't ditch you,
Ko...da?
Hmm.
R-Rutt?
Go away, eh? I'm eatin' twigs.
-R-Rutt?
-Go away.
You're breakin'
my concentration, eh?
W-we should start running.
-How come?
-Like, now!
I can't.
I'm still digesting, eh?
I'll get cramps.
Ptoo! Whoa, gee! He's after us!
Come on, little brother!
Ow! Ooh! Cramp!
Actually,
if you really want to know...
Actually,
if you really want to know...
how me and my mom
got separated...
I was saving this story
for the salmon run...
but I'll tell you.
It was probably
the fifth or sixth...
most coldest day
in my entire life.
Oh, this sounds good.
You should definitely save it.
-You think so?
-Oh, yeah--for your friends.
Oh.
Well, I have this other story--
Uh, tell you what.
How about no talking?
-OK. Then I'll sing.
-No, no, no, no, no.
Tell everybody
I'm on my way
Will you stop it?
New friends and new places
to see
Shh! Koda, stop singing.
With--
Yes, I'm on my way
And there's nowhere else
that I'd rather be
Uhh.
-Whoa!
-Aah!
Hey! Hold on, eh!
Wait--wait up.
-How's it going , bear boy?
-And , uh , smallish bear.
Gee, I didn't know
you had a little brother.
-He's cute, eh?
-Well, actually, he's just a--
OK, there's this hunter, eh...
following us, and I was--
we was thinking.
If we could maybe just kind of
hang out with you guys--
Yeah, just hang out.
That's right.
Yeah. It'd be fun, you know?
I mean, if the hunter,
who's going to catch up--
Then you eat him.
Right. Well, that's what
we was thinking.
We lost the hunter
back under the glacier.
So, you don't think
he'll follow those?
They are quite nice.
I've got an idea.
OK, this is really weird.
Get out, eh. I'm driving.
When can I have a turn, eh?
It's not as easy as it looks.
Now, just watch what I do, OK?
Well, let's get
a backseat or something.
I look like you hunted me.
Hey, come on.
Beauty, eh?
Beauty, eh?
OK, here's how I remember it.
If the snow is white,
then it's all right.
Yellow or green,
it's just not clean.
I learned that one
the hard way.
Oh, that reminds me.
Last year at the salmon run...
Oh, that reminds me.
Last year at the salmon run...
my friend Bucky
totally dared me...
but I'd heard about
this other cub...
who stuck his tongue
to an iceberg...
and then he started
to float away.
And so, to save him, they had
to, like, rip off his tongue.
And so now he has to talk...
Iike this all the time and--
Do you ever stop talking?
Whoa, look.
The night rainbow.
You can see the spirits
from here.
You know about
the great spirits?
Yeah. My grandma's up there
and my granddad.
Mom says the spirits...
make all the magical changes
of the world...
Iike how the leaves
change color...
or the moon changes shapes
or tadpoles change into frogs.
Yeah, l--I get it.
You know, for a change...
maybe they could just
leave things alone.
-What do you mean?
-My brother's a spirit.
If it wasn't for him,
I--I wouldn't be here.
You have a brother up there?
What happened to him?
He was killed by a b--
by a monster.
What's your brother's name?
Sitka.
Thanks, Sitka.
If it weren't for you,
I would've never met Kenai.
I always wanted a brother.
So, you want to play I Spy?
So, you want to play I Spy?
All right. I'll go first.
-OK.
-I spy something green.
-Tree?
-Aww.
-My turn?
-Yeah.
OK, I spy something tall.
-Tree.
-OK.
Uh, I spy...something with bark.
-Tree?
-Aww.
OK, I spy something...
uh, a vertical log.
-Tree.
-Yeah.
-OK, I spy--
-Tree.
-Ohh.
-OK, my turn.
-Tree.
-No, I got--
-Oh, it counts.
-I didn't even spy anything.
-lt counts.
-OK.
Tree.
Uhh. Let's play something else.
Uhh.
Koda, uh...come on.
-Koda, wake up.
-Two more months, mom.
Uhh.
Hmm.
So, where are we?
Um...
Hmm.
Well, which way?
Um...I think it's that way.
You think, or you know?
Uh, that way?
Uhh. Why wasn't l
turned into a homing pigeon?
Come on.
Hey, riding mammoths
was your idea.
Thanks for the ride, guys.
See you.
Lucky for you I've been lost
worse than this before.
Last summer, I was digging
for roots with Bucky--
Uhh. Enough with the stories.
I don't care about the time
you and Binky found...
you know, the world's biggest
pine cone ever.
First of all,
his name's Bucky, not Binky.
Second, it wasn't a pine cone.
It was a pine nut...
and it was huge--
even bigger than your fat head.
Oh, gee, our big guardian bear
is leaving, eh?
Yeah, yeah, we better follow.
Come on.
I--can you swing your leg...
-I can't--I can't get off.
-Me, neither.
OK, you guys! I guess we'll--
I guess we'll just catch up
with those guys later, eh?
-Ahh. Good trip, eh?
-Beauty.
You know, I was thinking. Now
might be a really good time...
for me to drive, eh?
Just relax and enjoy the ride.
Yeah. OK.
Whee.
I'm sorry we're lost, OK?
Even though
it's pretty much your fault.
My fault? Uhh. That's it.
Just remember,
if it weren't for me...
you'd still be hanging
upside down right now.
Yeah, well,
better than being stuck...
in the middle of nowhere with
you and your blabbering mouth.
"I'm lost.
I can't find my mommy.
Will you take me
to the salmon run?"
Why don't you just grow up?
Fine.
I'll just go on my own, then.
Fine. Go ahead.
-Fine.
-Fine.
Fine.
Aww.
Koda?
Koda.
Whoa.
Those monsters are really scary.
Especially with those sticks.
Come on. Let's go.
So, you recognize anything yet?
So, you recognize anything yet?
Or maybe you can't see
past my fat head.
So, do you really think
I have a fat head?
Well, if you hunched
your shoulders a little...
it wouldn't seem so big.
Oh, you mean like this?
Or like this?
Ha ha! How about this?
Oh, my. That was good.
Hey, maybe they can
give us directions.
-Uhh! Ohh!
-Uhh! Ohh!
Oh, that clears up the sinuses.
-Oh, it does.
-OK, OK, OK.
-OK.
-Hit me again.
I think she's looking.
Hello, sweetie. Ha ha ha.
Oh, yeah. She's
checking me out, all right.
-What?
-Hey, baby.
No, no, no. Come on, you nitwit.
Are you out of your head?
She's looking at me.
Look at that.
Right. Like she's looking
at your ugly mug?
My--excuse me, miss.
One second.
-It's go time, baby.
-Oh, you want to go?
-Yeah!
-Come on, bring it on.
-Horns up.
-Hey.
-Hold on.
-Excuse me.
What do you want?
-What is that? Who is that?
-Just a minute, bear.
-Hey, shut up!
-Hey, shut up!
-No, you shut up!
-No, you shut up!
-No, you shut up!
-No, you shut up!
-Hey, will you shut up?
-Hey, will you shut up?
-No.
-Just shut up!
Ha. I think their horns
are screwed on too tight.
Ha ha ha ha.
Hey, wait a second.
-I know this place.
-You do?
Yeah.
The salmon run's not far.
Ha ha ha.
We just have to go through here.
What?
Hey, are you sure you know
where you're going?
Yeah, yeah, follow me.
Uhh!
Koda!
Koda!
Koda?
Where are you?
-Yaah!
-Aah!
-Don't do that.
-Scared you, didn't l?
There's scared,
and then there's surprised.
And you were both. Ha ha ha.
Whoa.
Baah! Roar! Raah!
Nice try.
Uh, you got a little spit
right there.
Kenai!
You're not getting me this time.
-No, Kenai, look out!
-Uhh!
Uhh!
-No.
-Come on!
Waah!
Aah! Uhh!
Kenai!
Kenai, where are you?
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh!
Left, left!
No, no, no, the other left!
Uhh! Uhh!
Kenai!
-Uhh!
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Unh!
-Unh!
Aah!
No!
What are you doing?
We got to get out of here!
Aah!
Aah!
Uhh!
-Why do they hate us, Kenai?
-We're bears.
-So?
-So, you know how they are.
They're--they're killers.
Wait a minute.
Who's the killers?
-Bears.
-What? Which bears?
I'm not like that,
and you're not like that.
Well, obviously not all bears.
I mean, you're OK,
but most bears--
most bears will look for
any excuse to attack the human.
But, Kenai, he attacked us.
You know,
you're--you're just a cub.
When you're older,
you'll understand.
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fish!
Huh?
We made it! Ha ha! We're here!
-Come on!
-What? Koda--
-Fish, fish!
-Hey, what are you--
Hey, get away!
Ow! Go on, shoo!
Uhh! Uhh.
Aah!
Aah?
Hey, you're stirring up
the water, dude.
Yeah. Try not to scare off
the fish there, buddy.
-Uh...
-Tug!
Hey, Koda, come here.
Ha ha! Look at you.
Hey, Tug,
have you seen my mom yet?
No, as a matter of fact,
I haven't seen her.
Ha ha.
Me and my friend Kenai beat her.
He's with you?
Uh, heh. Uh, hi.
Aah!
Huh. I've never seen you
at the run before.
Where are you from?
Er, uh...well, l--I mean...
And, see, Kenai?
There's the mountain...
just like I promised.
The lights touch the top
every single night.
Ha ha! It's going to be
a lot harder getting up there...
than it was
riding those mammoths.
-Mammoths?
-Are you kidding me?
That's kind of weird.
Yeah.
He does a lot of weird stuff...
Like the way he drinks water
with a leaf.
He never sharpens his claws
on a tree.
He's never hibernated before.
Koda. Koda!
Ha ha. Ahem.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Excuse us.
Hmm.
He's kind of jumpy, isn't he?
OK, OK.
Koda, l, uh...
Uh, I got to get going.
Well, when you come back,
we can go and--
I--I won't be coming back.
What? Why not?
Because...
Well, it's hard to explain.
-You're leaving?
-Aah!
No. I--I mean, yes.
Uh, well, it's just that l--l...
I don't belong here.
Don't belong?
Every bear belongs here.
Ha ha! Come on, buddy.
Let's have some fun!
Whoo hoo hoo hoo!
Yeah.
All right, all right. Settle
down, everyone, settle down.
We--hey, don't throw
your fish bones over there.
Somebody could choke on that.
Look, OK, I'll go first.
OK, let's see.
The most interesting thing
that happened to me this year.
Hmm. I'd...
Oh, I know, I know, I know.
Listen to this.
I'd say it was when I finally
knocked down that tree...
that was blocking the view
from my cave.
Now I got a family of chipmunks
staying at my place.
Ahem.
Um, yeah. All right,
all right, everybody...
come on, let me see
some paws in the air.
Who's going to be next?
Come on.
Tug, Tug, I got one!
Watch me, watch me.
Ha. Hey, got you.
This year,
I lost my dear husband Edgar.
Quit telling everyone
I'm dead!
Sometimes
I can still hear his voice.
I'm getting the next one.
Hmm.
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah.
This is it.
I got it, I got--uhh!
I guess it's our turn.
This is the year
I met the most gorgeous--
No, you're gorgeous.
You're gorgeouser.
Get a cave.
Uhh.
If only Edgar was alive.
I told you, woman!
I'm right here!
I love you, buttercup.
-This has got to be it. Uhh!
-Heh. Here you go, Koda.
-You got to tell it, Kenai.
-What?
That's right, Kenai.
You caught it, you tell it.
Didn't you play this game
when you were a cub?
-Uh...
-Come on, Keno.
Ha ha. OK, all right,
already, all right.
Uh, you want to know
what I did this year?
Yeah!
I went on
the longest, hardest...
most exhausting journey
I've ever been on...
with the biggest
pain in the neck I've ever met.
Heh. What do you expect
from a little brother?
Aww!
-Ha ha.
-OK, buddy, your turn.
Ha ha. Let's hear it, Koda.
OK, OK. Here we go. Ahem.
This year I watched my mom
in a life-and-death struggle...
against all odds
battling possibly...
the most fiercest creature
on the face of the earth.
-OK, who's next?
-What?
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
I think we all want to hear
the rest of that one, Koda.
I thought you might say that.
Hmm, let's see.
It was probably the fifth
or sixth most coldest day...
in my entire life.
Me and mom were eating fish,
having a great time...
when all of a sudden,
she pushes me into the bushes...
and tells me to be real quiet.
She says, "l smell something,"
so I started sniffing.
There was something
in the woods...
running right towards us,
getting closer and closer.
-Ooh! Ahh!
-Hmm.
And then, out of the trees,
jumps the hunter!
Ahh!
And now there's nowhere
for mama to go.
The monster has her backed up
against this giant glacier!
Ahh!
The monster attacks--pop!
But mom's too quick for him.
And before he can do it again,
she stands up real big...
and yells, "Go away!"
Aah! Aah!
Then mom smells more of 'em.
There's a whole pack
comin' right at us!
Sitka, no! The bear!
She runs out to stop them...
before they can get to me.
And all around they're
poking her with sticks.
The whole thing broke,
and they fell into the water.
There was ice everywhere!
She couldn't hold her breath
any longer before--pow!
She burst out of the water.
I've never been so scared
in my life.
I'm going after the bear.
-Koda?
-Aah!
Whoa! Fell off a glacier?
I've never seen anything
like that.
Can you imagine?
Kenai.
What's the matter, Kenai?
Koda, so what happened next?
Was she OK?
-Unh!
-Hey, Kenai, what's wrong?
Where you going?
She got out of the water OK,
but that's how we got separated.
Right after that, I met Kenai.
Kenai?
Rargh!
-Scared you again, huh?
-Uh-huh. Yeah.
Where have you been?
You look horrible.
Koda.
My mom says
when you eat too much fish...
-you should just lie down--
-Koda.
There's something l, uh...
y-you know that story
you told me last night?
Yeah.
Well, l--I have a story
to tell you.
Really? What's it about?
Well...it's kind of
about a man...
and kind of about a bear.
But...mostly
it's about a monster--
a monster who did
something so bad...
Koda,
I did something very wrong.
I don't like this story.
Your mother's not coming.
No.
Koda!
Koda!
Koda!
Koda, I wish I could...
If there was--if there
was just some way...
I--I'd give anything if...
I could just...
I'm sorry, Koda.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Kenai.
I don't know
what I'm doing anymore.
I need help.
Sitka?
-Ohh!
-Look, I am sorry.
If I was driving,
this never would've happened.
Just stop it.
You never let me drive,
you never let me do nothing.
Oh, trample off, eh?
I said I was sorry. Let it go.
I can't believe
you totalled a mammoth, eh.
Oh, come on. That mountain
came out of nowhere.
I'm afraid I cannot
accept your apology.
It was in my blind spot.
-Hey, look.
-Wh-what?
It's that little cub.
Gee, eh,
something's bugging him.
Yeah, what's wrong,
smallish bear?
Nothing. I'm fine.
Oh, good. Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah. You're a big
selfish, reckless hoofer...
and you're never gonna change.
-What?!
-I'm fed up with it, eh.
From now on,
he's my new brother.
You can't do that!
Sorry. You've been replaced
with my dear brother...
Gee, I forget your name. What's
your name again, little bear?
I don't want any more brothers.
See, he's had enough of you,
too, eh?
Aw, come on.
I promise I'll change.
Trample off.
You'll never change.
Being a brother
means nothing to you.
-Of course it does, eh.
-Oh, yeah? Like what?
What about the time
your hooves froze in the pond?
Who sat with you
all winter, eh?
You did.
And who showed you
where the good grazing is?
I mean the really tender stuff,
all covered in dew?
Now, why do you think
I did that, eh?
Because l...
because I love...dew.
Excuse me? I don't believe
I heard what you said.
I said I love...dew.
I love dew, too, eh.
-Hey, I can change.
-Go away, eh.
-Come on. I can change.
-Go away, eh. Don't touch me.
I can change!
Hey! Not--not there.
That's the spot.
Like, we'll see you later,
smallish bear.
Yeah. Good day, eh.
Hey, you know
what this calls for?
A pile of delicious
barley and amberweed...
on a cool bed
of malted hops, eh?
I like it.
Sitka! Sitka, are you there?
Sitka!
Please. Please, Sitka.
I don't know what else to do.
Sitka?
-Denahi.
-Aah!
Sitka, hurry! Change me back!
Where are you, Sitka?
Aah!
Aah!
Raar!
Denahi.
Denahi, please.
Koda?
No!
Leave him alone!
Koda! Uhh!
Kenai?
Sitka?
Koda.
Koda, don't be afraid.
It's me.
He needs me.
You know,
he did look better as a bear.
But...Denahi.
It's all right, Kenai.
No matter what you choose...
you'll always be
my little brother.
Ha ha!
Oh.
Did I say "little"?
Kenai!
Ha!
My brother Kenai...
went on to live with Koda
and the other bears.
He taught me
that love is very powerful.
And I passed on
the wisdom of his story...
to our people--
The story of a boy
who became a man...
by becoming a bear.
Hyah! Kwanzaa!
So, like, what are you
doing there, smallish bear?
I'm practicing my moves.
Want to see one?
Sure, eh.
This ought to be good, eh?
Listen to me.
-Uh-huh.
-Uh-huh.
I was a man that was changed
into a bear. No beaver.
Man into bear. That's it.
Oh, yeah. So...
before that you was
probably, like, a goat, eh?
Hey, what about
a water buffalo?
No, no, no, he's a rabbit, eh.
Look at his ears
and his furry little feet.
-Watch out for the rabbit, eh.
-No way, eh.
OK, now, everyone.
Take a--
big inhale, eh?
And then on the--
on the exhale...
shift into
salutation to the sun.
-No, you shut up!
-Uhh! Uhh!
-No, you shut up!
-Uhh! Uhh!
-Aww...
-Uhh.
Heh heh.
How you doing over there, Koda?
Oh, pretty good.
-Uhh...
-Arr!
Uhh.
Ahem.
In accordance with...
all federal and state
wildlife regulations...
no fish were harmed during
the making of this film.
Aah!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
No! He's going to eat me!
Aah! Aah!
Heh heh heh. Cut. Cut.
Somebody help me!
Ooh!
