A fiddler on the roof.
Sounds crazy, no?
But here, in our little
village of Anatevka...
you might say...
every one of us
is a fiddler on the roof...
trying to scratch out...
a pleasant, simple tune...
without breaking his neck.
It isn't easy. You may ask...
why do we stay up there...
if it's so dangerous?
Well, we stay because...
Anatevka is our home.
And how do we keep our balance?
That I can tell you in one word:
Tradition!
Tradition
Because of our traditions...
we've kept our balance
for many, many years.
Here in Anatevka...
we have traditions
for everything:
how to sleep, how to eat...
how to work...
how to wear clothes.
For instance, we always
keep our heads covered...
and always wear
a little prayer shawl.
This shows
our constant devotion to God.
You may ask...
how did this tradition
get started?
I'll tell you.
I don't know.
But it's a tradition.
And because of our traditions...
every one of us knows who he is...
and what God expects him to do.
Who day and night
must scramble for a living
Feed a wife and children
Say his daily prayers
And who has a right
as master of the house
To have the final word at home
The papa
Tradition
Who must know the way
to make a proper home
A quiet home, a kosher home
Who must raise a family
and run the home
So Papa's free to read
the Holy Book
The mama
Tradition
At three I started Hebrew school
At ten I learned a trade
I hear they picked
a bride for me
I hope she's pretty
And who does Mama teach
To mend and tend and fix
Preparing her to marry
Whoever Papa picks
The daughters
Tradition
- The papa
- Mama
- Sons
- The daughters
Tradition
And in the circle
of our little village...
we've always had our special types.
For instance...
Yente the matchmaker...
Reb Nachum the beggar...
and most important of all...
our beloved rabbi.
Rabbi, may I ask a question?
Certainly.
Is there a proper blessing
for the czar?
A blessing for the czar?
Of course.
May God bless and keep the czar...
far away from us.
Then there are the others
in our village.
They make a much bigger circle.
We don't bother them...
and so far, they don't bother us.
And among ourselves...
we always get along perfectly well.
Of course, there was the time...
when he sold him a horse...
and told him it was six years old...
when it was really 12.
But now, it's all over...
and we all live
in simple peace and harmony.
- It was really 12 years old.
- It was six.
Tevye knows it was 12.
Twelve!
It was 12!
Tradition
Traditions, traditions.
Without our traditions...
our lives would be as shaky as...
as a fiddler on the roof.
Mama! Yente the matchmaker
is coming.
Maybe she's finally found a match
for you, Tzeitel.
From your mouth to God's ears.
Why does she come now?
It's almost Sabbath.
I want to talk to Yente alone.
But, Mama, the men she finds.
The last was so old,
and he was bald. He had no hair.
A girl without a dowry
can't be so particular.
You want hair, marry a monkey.
Even a poor girl has to look
at her husband sometime.
A husband's to get, not to look at.
I'm not yet 20...
Do you have to boast
about your age?
Do you want to tempt the evil eye?
Out, all of you.
There's work to be done
before the Sabbath. Hurry!
Golde, I have such news for you.
Not every day in the week news.
Once in a lifetime news.
Such diamonds, such jewels.
I'll find a husband
for every one of them...
but you shouldn't be
so picky, right?
Of course right,
because after all...
even the worst
husband, God forbid...
is better than no husband,
God forbid.
Who should know better than me?
Since my husband died...
I've been a poor widow,
all alone, no one to talk to.
All I do at night
is think of him.
Even that gives me no pleasure.
- Is Tzeitel in the house?
- Go in and find out.
Thank you, Bielke.
- He never raised his voice.
- Good afternoon.
Is Tzeitel here?
She's busy. Come back later.
- I'd like to tell her something.
- Later.
Later. Oh, all right.
What does that skinny tailor
want with Tzeitel?
They've been friends since they
were babies. They talk, they play.
Play? What do they play?
I don't know. They're children.
From such children
come other children.
Motel is nothing.
Yente, you said
you had news for me.
Children.
They are your blessing
in your old age.
But my Aaron, may he rest in peace,
couldn't give me children.
To tell the truth,
Golde, he hardly tried.
But what's the use complaining?
Other women enjoy complaining.
Not Yente.
Not every woman
in the world is a Yente.
Well, l...
I have to go home now...
to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.
So good-bye, Golde...
and it was a pleasure
talking our hearts out.
You said you had news.
Oi, I'm losing my head.
Someday it'll fall off altogether...
and a horse will kick it in the mud...
and good-bye, Yente.
Of course, the news.
It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher.
A good, fine man...
and I don't have to say
he's well off, no?
Yes. But he's Ionely, the poor man.
He's been a widower all these years.
Of course you understand.
So, to make it short.
Out of the whole town,
he's cast his eye...
on Tzeitel.
- My Tzeitel?
- No, the czar's Tzeitel.
Of course your Tzeitel.
Such a match for my Tzeitel.
But Tevye wants a learned man.
He doesn't like Lazar.
Good, so Lazar won't marry him.
He wants the daughter, not the father.
Listen to me, Golde.
You send Tevye to him.
Don't tell him what it's about.
Let Lazar discuss it himself.
He'll win him over.
He's a good man and a wealthy man.
Let me know how it went.
You don't have to thank me...
because aside from my fee,
which Lazar will pay anyway...
it gives me satisfaction...
to make people happy.
True? Of course true.
So good-bye, Golde,
and you're welcome.
Good-bye, Yente.
Come, children, get changed
for the Sabbath. Hurry.
- Hurry with your work.
- I wonder if Yente found you a husband.
I'm not anxious for that.
- Unless it's Motel the tailor.
- I didn't ask you.
You're the oldest.
They have to make a match for you...
before making one for me.
Then after her, one for me.
- So if Yente...
- Yente!
Well, somebody has to
arrange the matches.
- She might bring someone wonderful.
- Someone interesting.
- Well-off.
- And important.
Matchmaker, matchmaker
Make me a match
Find me a find
Catch me a catch
Matchmaker, matchmaker
Look through your book
And make me a perfect match
Matchmaker, matchmaker
I'll bring the veil
You bring the groom
Slender and pale
Bring me a ring
for I'm longing to be
The envy of all I see
For Papa, make him a scholar
For Mama, make him rich as a king
For me, well, I wouldn't holler
If he were as handsome as anything
Matchmaker, matchmaker
Make me a match
Find me a find
Catch me a catch
Night after night
in the dark I'm alone
So find me a match
Of my own
Since when are you
interested in a match, Chava?
I thought you had
your eye on books.
You have your eye
on the rabbi's son.
Well, why not?
We only have one rabbi...
and he only has one son.
Why shouldn't I want the best?
Because you're from a poor family...
so whatever Yente brings, you'll take.
Right? Of course right.
Hodel, oh, Hodel
Have I made a match for you
He's handsome, he's young
All right, he's 62
But he's a nice man
A good catch, true, true
I promise you'll be happy
And even if you're not
There's more to life than that
Don't ask me what
Chava, I found him
Will you be a lucky bride
He's handsome, he's tall
That is, from side to side
But he's a nice man
A good catch
- Right
- Right
- You heard he has a temper
- He'll beat you every night
But only when he's sober
So you're all right
Did you think you'd get a prince
Well, I'll find the best I can
With no dowry, no money
No family background
Be glad you've got a man
Matchmaker, matchmaker
You know that I'm
Still very young
Please take your time
Up to this minute
I misunderstood
That I could get stuck for good
Dear Yente
See that he's gentle
Remember you were also a bride
It's not that I'm sentimental
It's just that I'm terrified
Matchmaker, matchmaker
Plan me no plans
I'm in no rush
Maybe I've learned
Playing with matches
a girl can get burned
So bring me no ring
Groom me no groom
Find me no find
Catch me no catch
Unless he's a matchless match
Dear God, was that necessary?
Did you have to make him lame
just before the Sabbath?
Ah, that wasn't nice.
It's enough you pick on me...
bless me with five daughters,
a life of poverty.
That's all right, but what
have you got against my horse?
Really, sometimes I think...
when things are too quiet
up there...
you say to yourself...
"Let's see.
What kind of mischief...
can I play on my friend Tevye?"
Aha! So you're finally here,
my breadwinner.
I'll talk to you later.
- So why are you late today?
- His foot went lame.
Hurry. The sun won't wait.
I have something
important to say.
- I still have deliveries.
- You'll be late for the Sabbath.
I won't be late.
You'll be late.
I won't be late.
If you ever stop talking,
I won't be late!
You can die from him.
As the Good Book says...
"Heal us, O Lord,
and we shall be healed."
In other words,
send us the cure.
We've got the sickness already.
Well, I'm not really complaining.
After all, with your help...
I'm starving to death.
Oh, dear Lord.
You made many, many poor people.
I realize, of course,
it's no shame to be poor...
but it's no great honor either.
So what would have been
so terrible...
if I had a small fortune?
If I were a rich man
All day long
I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work hard
If I were a biddy biddy rich
Idle deedle daidle daidle man
I'd build
A big, tall house
With rooms by the dozen
Right in the middle of the town
A fine tin roof
with real wooden floors below
There would be one long staircase
just going up
And one even longer coming down
And one more leading nowhere
Just for show
I'd fill my yard
With chicks and turkeys and geese
And ducks for the town
to see and hear
Squawking just as noisily as they can
And each loud
Will land like
a trumpet on the ear
As if to say
Here lives a wealthy man
If I were a rich man
All day long
I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work hard
If I were a biddy biddy rich
Idle deedle daidle daidle man
I'd see my wife, my Golde
Looking like a rich man's wife
With a proper double chin
Supervising meals
to her heart's delight
I'd see her putting on airs
and strutting like a peacock
Oh, what a happy mood she's in
Screaming at her servants
day and night
The most important men in town
Will come to fawn on me
They will ask me to advise them
Like Solomon the Wise
If you please, Reb Tevye
Pardon me, Reb Tevye
Posing problems that
would cross a rabbi's eyes
And it won't make
one bit of difference
If I answer right or wrong
When you're rich
they think you really know
If I were rich
I'd have the time that I lack
To sit in the synagogue and pray
And maybe have a seat
by the Eastern wall
And I'd discuss the holy books
With the learned men
seven hours every day
And that would be
The sweetest thing of all
If I were a rich man
All day long
I'd biddy biddy bum
If I were a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work hard
Lord who made
the lion and the lamb
You decreed I should be what I am
Would it spoil
some vast eternal plan
If I were
A wealthy man
Where's your horse?
Well, he decided
to take the day off.
- Have a good Sabbath.
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Tevye, you're late.
- Where's your horse?
- It's almost the Sabbath.
- You kept us all waiting.
What happened to your horse?
Look at this!
Look what it says in the paper!
- Look.
- What's the matter, Avram?
Sha! Quiet!
Stop braying like a pack of mules,
and let a man talk. Talk, Avram.
My paper came to the post office
today like it does every week.
Usually it comes Thursday,
but sometimes...
Avram, that's not talking.
That's babbling.
- Tell us the news.
- What does it say?
Quiet!
Talk, Avram.
Well, I was reading my paper.
It's nothing very important... a story
about the crops in the Ukraine...
and this and that.
Avram, talk.
And then, I saw this.
All right. We all see it.
What does it say?
"In a village called Rajanka...
all the Jews were evicted...
forced to leave their homes."
For what reason?
It doesn't say. Maybe the czar
wanted their land. Maybe a plague.
May the czar have
his own personal plague!
Amen!
Why don't you ever bring us
some good news?
It's not my fault.
I only read it.
"An edict from the authorities."
May the authorities
grow like onions...
with their heads in the ground.
What good will your cursing do?
You stand around, curse and chatter,
and you don't do anything.
You'll all chatter your way
into the grave.
Excuse me.
You're not from this village.
Where are you from?
Kiev.
I studied at the university.
The university.
Tell me, is that a place
where you learned...
how not to respect your elders?
That's where I learned
there is more to life than talk.
- You need to know the outside world.
- Careful, my paper.
Why should I break my head
about the outside world?
Let the outside world
break its own head.
Well put!
He's right.
As the Good Book says...
"If you spit in the air,
it lands in your face."
Nonsense.
You can't close your eyes
to what's happening in the world.
He's right.
He's right, and he's right?
They can't both be right.
You know, you are also right.
He's too young
to wipe his own nose.
Good Sabbath, Tevye.
The university!
- Here. Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath, Tevye.
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
I apologize. Here.
Tevye, the rabbi's order.
Of course.
So you are from Kiev, Reb...
Perchik.
So you are a newcomer here, huh?
As Abraham said...
"I'm a stranger
in a strange land."
Moses said that.
Forgive me.
As King David said, "I'm slow of speech
and slow of tongue."
That was also Moses.
For a man with a slow tongue
he talked a lot.
Here, Reb Perchik.
Have a piece.
I have no money,
and I'm not a beggar.
Take it. It's a blessing
for me to give.
Very well. For your sake.
Thank you.
You know, it's no crime
to be poor.
In this world,
the rich are the criminals.
- Someday their wealth will be ours.
- That would be nice.
If they would agree, I would agree.
Who will make this miracle
come to pass?
People. Ordinary people.
- Like you?
- Like me.
Until your golden day comes,
Reb Perchik, how will you live?
By giving lessons to children.
Do you have any children?
I have five daughters.
Five!
Daughters!
Girls should learn too.
Girls are people.
- A radical!
- Go away.
I'd be willing to teach them,
open their minds to great thoughts.
I'd like them
to know the Good Book.
The Bible has many lessons
for our times.
Perchik...
I'm a very poor man...
but food for lessons, huh?
Good. Stay with us for the Sabbath.
Of course, we don't
eat like kings...
but we don't starve either.
As the Good Book says,
when a poor man eats a chicken...
one of them is sick.
Where does the Book say that?
All right. It doesn't
exactly say that...
but someplace it has something
about a chicken.
Good Sabbath.
- Did Yente find somebody?
- I don't know.
- Good Sabbath, children.
- Good Sabbath, Papa.
Children, this is Perchik.
Perchik, this is
my eldest daughter.
Good Sabbath. You have
a pleasant daughter.
I have five pleasant daughters.
This is mine, and this is mine...
and this is mine...
and this is mine,
and this is mine, and...
Well, this is not mine.
This is Motel Kamzoil.
So, you did us a favor
and came home.
Well, this is also mine.
This is Perchik from Kiev.
He'll be staying the Sabbath
with us. He is a teacher!
- Would you like to take lessons?
- I'm a good teacher.
I heard that the rabbi who must praise
himself has a congregation of one.
Your daughter has a quick
and witty tongue.
The wit she gets from me.
As the Good Book says...
The Good Book can wait.
Wash.
The tongue she gets
from her mother.
Motel, you're also eating with us?
Of course. Another blessing.
Tzeitel, get the small table.
Chava, the two chairs from outside.
Children, finish dressing.
You can wash at the well.
Hurry. Hodel, help them.
It's almost the Sabbath. Hurry!
Tevye, I have something
to say to you.
Why should today be different?
I have something to tell you!
Tzeitel, I have
something to tell you.
- Yente was here.
- I saw her.
If there's a match,
it will be too late for us.
But I've found someone who will
sell me his sewing machine.
So maybe in a few weeks
I can buy it, and then your father...
That might be too late.
Lazar Wolf wants to see you.
The butcher?
What is it about?
I don't know, only
he says it's important.
I have nothing
for him to slaughter.
After the Sabbath,
talk with him.
About what? If he's thinking
about buying my new milk cow...
he can forget it.
I want you to talk...
I want you to talk to...
What else can I do?
You could ask my father
for my hand tonight.
Now.
Why should he consider me?
I'm a poor tailor.
I'm only a poor milkman's daughter.
Just talk to him.
Tzeitel, if your father
says no, that's it. It's final.
He'll yell at me.
I'm just a poor tailor.
Even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness.
That's true.
Amen. A man sends you an important
message, you can talk to him.
- I don't want to...
- Talk to him!
All right!
After the Sabbath I'll talk to him!
All right. I'll talk to him.
Well, it's getting late.
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, Papa.
Children! Come down, children!
We are lighting the candles.
Not now, Motel. Hurry up, children!
Not now, Motel.
The sun is almost down.
What is it?
Yes?
Well, Motel, what is it?
Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye.
Hurry up.
Hurry, children.
It's getting late.
May the Lord
protect and defend you
May he always
shield you from shame
May you come to be
In Israel a shining name
May you be like Ruth
and like Esther
May you be deserving of praise
Strengthen them, O Lord
And keep them
from the stranger's ways
May God bless you
And grant you long lives
May the Lord fulfill
our Sabbath prayer for you
May God make you
Good mothers and wives
May he send you husbands
Who will care for you
May the Lord protect and defend you
May the Lord preserve you from pain
Favor them, O Lord
With happiness and peace
Oh, hear our Sabbath prayer
Amen
Is Reb...
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?
He's in the back.
Oh. May l...
- Come in.
- Oh, thank you.
And all this from
killing innocent animals?
- Don't touch anything.
- All right.
Well, Tevye.
You're here.
- Well, sit down.
- Thank you.
- Have a drink.
- I won't insult you by saying no.
Well. How goes it with you,
Reb Tevye?
- How should it go?
- You're right.
- And you?
- The same.
I'm sorry to hear that.
How is your brother-in-law
in America?
- He's doing very well.
- Oh, he wrote you?
- No, not lately.
- Then how do you know?
If he was doing badly,
he would write.
Yes?
I suppose you know
why I wanted to see you.
Oh, yes, I do, but...
there is no use talking about it.
I understand how you feel...
but...
After all, you have
a few more without her.
Ah, I see.
Today you want one.
Tomorrow you may want two.
Two? What would I do with two?
The same as you do with one.
This is very important to me.
Why is it so important to you?
Frankly...
because...
I'm Ionely.
Lonely?
Reb Lazar, what are
you talking about?
How can a little cow
keep you company?
Little cow?
Is that what you call her?
What else should I call her? That's
what she is. What are you talking about?
- Don't you know?
- We're talking about my milk cow...
you want to buy from me.
A milk cow?
A milk cow so I won't be Ionely?
I'm talking about...
your daughter Tzeitel.
My daughter Tzeitel?
Of course.
Your daughter Tzeitel.
I see her every Thursday
in my butcher shop...
and she's made
a very good impression on me.
A very good impression.
I like her.
Why don't we just shake hands...
and call it a match?
And...
I'll be good to her.
l...
I like her.
Well?
- What do you think?
- What do I think?
I never really liked him.
Why should I? You can have a fine
conversation with him...
if you talk
about kidneys and livers.
On the other hand...
not everyone has to be a scholar.
And with a butcher...
my daughter will
surely never know hunger.
Maybe I misjudged him.
He's a good man.
He likes her.
And he'll try
to make her happy.
What do I think?
It's a match.
- You agree?
- I agree.
- You've made me a happy man.
- Good.
- Let's drink on it.
- Why not?
- To you.
- No, my friend. To you.
- To both of us.
- To our agreement!
To our prosperity.
To our good health
and happiness.
And most important of all...
To life, to life
Le'chayim
Le'chayim, le'chayim
To life
Here's to the father
I've tried to be
Here's to my bride-to-be
Drink le'chayim to life
Life has a way
of confusing us
Blessing and bruising us
God would like us to be joyful
Even when our hearts
lie panting on the floor
How much more can we be joyful
When there's really something
To be joyful for
- To Tzeitel, my daughter
- My wife
It gives you
something to think about
Something to drink about
- Mordcha!
- Yes. What is it?
- Drinks for everyone!
- What's the big occasion?
I'm taking myself a bride!
- Who's the lucky one?
- Tevye's eldest, Tzeitel!
To Lazar Wolf
To Tevye
- To Tzeitel, your daughter
- My wife
May all your futures
be pleasant ones
Not like our present ones
It takes a wedding
to make us say
Let's live another day
We'll raise a glass
and sip a drop of schnapps
In honor of the great good luck
that favored you
We know that when good fortune
favors two such men
It stands to reason
we deserve it too
To us and our good fortune
Be happy, be healthy, long life
And if our good fortune
never comes
Here's to whatever comes
Heaven bless you both
To your health
And may we live
together in peace
Thank you.
May you both be favored
with the future of your choice
May you live to see
a thousand reasons to rejoice
Hey! I like it!
Drinks for everybody!
To life!
After...
the marriage...
we will be related.
You will be my...
papa.
Your papa?
Lazar Wolf...
I always wanted a son.
But I wanted one
a little younger than myself.
Good night.
I hear that congratulations
are in order, Tevye.
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
Yes, Your Honor?
I have news I think
I should tell you as a friend.
I'm giving you this news
because I like you.
You're an honest, decent person,
even though you are a Jew.
Oh, thank you, Your Honor.
How often does a man get
a compliment like that?
And the news?
We have received orders
that sometime soon...
this district is to have
a little unofficial demonstration.
What?
A pogrom? Here?
No. Just a little
unofficial demonstration.
Little?
- How little?
- Not too serious.
Just mischief so that if
an inspector comes...
he can see that we did our duty.
Personally, I don't know why there has
to be trouble between people.
But I thought I should tell you.
Thank you, Your Honor.
You're a good man.
If I may say so...
it's too bad
you're not a Jew.
That's what I like about you.
You're always joking.
Congratulations again
for your daughter.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Oh, about the other matter,
it won't be too bad.
- I wouldn't worry.
- Of course not.
Dear God...
did you have to send me
news like that...
today of all days?
I know, we are the chosen people...
but once in a while,
can't you choose someone else?
Anyway...
thank you for sending a husband...
for my Tzeitel.
Now, after Jacob had worked
for Laban for seven years...
do you know what happened?
Laban fooled him and gave him
his ugly daughter Leah.
So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced
to work another seven years.
So you see, children...
the Bible clearly teaches us...
you can never trust an employer.
And that is what
the Bible teaches us?
That is the lesson of Jacob...
if you interpret it correctly.
- Is your papa up yet?
- No, Mama.
Enough lessons. Back to the house.
There's work to be done.
Go on, children.
Another story tomorrow.
That was a very interesting
lesson, Perchik.
Do you think so?
Although I don't know if the rabbi
would agree with your interpretation.
Neither, I suppose,
would the rabbi's son.
My little sisters
talk too much.
What do you know about him,
except that he is a rabbi's son?
At least I know
he doesn't have strange ideas...
about turning
the world upside-down.
Good day, Perchik.
- You have wit, even intelligence.
- Thank you.
Perhaps. But what good
is your brain?
Without curiosity,
it is a rusty tool.
- Good day, Hodel.
- We have an old custom here!
A boy talks
respectfully to a girl.
But that is too traditional
for an advanced thinker like you.
Nothing must change. Everything
is perfect exactly as it is!
- We like our ways.
- Our ways are changing all over.
In the city, boys and girls
can be affectionate...
without the permission
of a matchmaker.
They hold hands together.
They even dance together!
New dances, like this.
I learned it in Kiev.
- Do you like it?
- It's very nice.
There.
We've just changed
an old custom.
Yes.
I mean... thank you.
I mean...
good day!
So, my prince is finally
out of bed.
- Not now.
- Open your eyes.
- Go away.
- The day's half gone.
Well?
Well, what happened last night
besides your drinking like a peasant?
Did you see Lazar Wolf?
Well, what did he say?
What did you say?
Where...
Where's Tzeitel?
She's in the barn.
Do you have news for me?
Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?
Well, what happened?
Woman, patience.
As the Good Book says,
good news will stay...
and bad news
will refuse to leave.
- And there's another saying...
- You can die from such a man!
Did you see Lazar?
Was it friendly?
- Sha, woman!
- Are you still drunk, or what?
Here she is.
Tzeitel, my lamb, come here.
You are to be congratulated.
You are going to be married.
Married?
What do you mean, Papa?
Lazar Wolf has asked
for your hand.
I knew it!
- The butcher?
- Dear God, I thank thee.
- I thank thee!
- Why do you have to...
What do you say, Tzeitel?
- What can she say?
- Let her say one word.
My firstborn, a bride.
May you grow old with him
in fortune and honor.
Not like Fruma Sarah,
Lazar's first wife.
She was a bitter woman.
May she rest in peace.
Not like my Tzeitel.
And now I must thank Yente.
My Tzeitel, a bride.
A bride! I thank thee!
Well, Chaveleh?
Mazel tov, Tzeitel.
"Mazel tov, Tzeitel."
What kind of
a mazel tov is that?
You, Reb Perchik, aren't you going
to congratulate her?
Congratulations, Tzeitel...
for getting a rich man.
Again with the rich.
What's wrong with being rich?
It's no reason to marry.
Money's the world's curse.
May the Lord
smite me with it...
and may I never recover!
"The world's curse."
My Tzeitel knows
I mean only her welfare.
Am I right, Tzeitel?
- Yes, Papa.
- There, you see?
I see. I see very well.
Well, my child...
why are you so silent?
Aren't you happy
with this blessing?
Papa...
What is it? Tell me.
Papa, I don't want
to marry him.
I can't marry him.
What do you mean you can't?
If I say you will, you will.
Papa, if it's a matter of money,
I'll do anything.
I'll work as a servant.
- Just don't...
- But we made an agreement!
And with us, an agreement
is an agreement.
Is that...
more important than I am, Papa?
Papa, don't force me, please!
I'll be unhappy all my days!
- I don't want to marry him.
- All right.
I won't force you.
Oh, thank you, Papa.
"Thank you, Papa."
It seems it was not ordained...
that you should have
all the comforts of life.
- Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?
- Later.
- But I would like to speak to you.
- Not now.
I have problems.
That's why I want to speak to you.
I think I can help.
Like a bandage can help a corpse.
Good-bye, Motel.
At least listen to him, Papa.
All right.
You have a tongue. Talk.
I hear you are arranging
a match for Tzeitel.
He also has ears.
Well...
- I have a match for Tzeitel.
- What kind of a match?
A perfect fit.
Like a glove.
This match was made
exactly to measure.
"Made to measure." Stop talking
like a tailor and tell me who is it?
Please don't shout
at me, Reb Tevye.
I won't shout.
Who is it?
It's me.
Myself.
It's him. Himself.
Either you're out of your mind
or you're crazy!
He must be crazy!
Arranging a match for yourself?
Are you everything? The bridegroom,
the matchmaker, the guests?
I suppose you'll
perform the ceremony yourself!
Please don't shout at me.
Being my own matchmaker...
I know it's a little unusual.
Unusual? It's crazy!
Times are changing, Reb Tevye.
Over a year ago, your daughter and I
gave each other our pledge...
that we would marry.
You gave each other a pledge?
Yes, Papa.
We gave each other our pledge.
They gave each other a pledge.
Unheard of, absurd.
You gave each other a pledge
Unthinkable
Where do you think you are
In Moscow, in Paris
Where do they think they are
America
And what do you think you're doing
You stitcher, you nothing
Who do you think you are
King Solomon
This isn't the way it's done
Not here, not now
Some things I will not
I cannot allow
Tradition
Marriages must be arranged
By the papa
This should never be changed
One little time
you pull out the prop
And where does it stop
Do I still have something to say
about my daughter?
Doesn't anyone have to ask
a father anymore?
I've wanted to ask you for some time.
First I wanted to save enough
for a sewing machine.
You stop talking nonsense.
You are just a poor tailor!
But even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness!
I promise you, your daughter
will not starve.
He's beginning
to talk like a man.
On the other hand...
what kind of a match would that be...
with a poor tailor?
On the other hand, he is an honest,
hard worker.
But on the other hand...
he has absolutely nothing.
On the other hand,
things could never get worse for him.
They could only get better.
They gave each other a pledge
Unheard of, absurd
They gave each other
a pledge
Unthinkable
But look at my daughter's face
She loves him
She wants him
And look at my daughter's eyes
So hopeful
Tradition!
Well, children...
when shall we make the wedding?
Thank you, Papa!
You won't be sorry.
- I won't be sorry?
- No.
I'm sorry already!
Thank you, Papa.
All right.
They gave each other a pledge.
What shall I tell Golde?
You were wonderful!
It was a miracle!
Wonder of wonders
Miracle of miracles
God took a Daniel once again
Stood by his side
and miracle of miracles
Walked him through
the lion's den
Wonder of wonders
Miracle of miracles
I was afraid
that God would frown
But like he did
so long ago in Jericho
God just made
a wall fall down
When Moses softened
Pharaoh's heart
That was a miracle
When God made the waters
of the Red Sea part
That was a miracle too
But of all God's miracles
large and small
The most miraculous
one of all
Is that out of
a worthless lump of clay
God has made a man today
Wonder of wonders
Miracle of miracles
God took a tailor
by the hand
Turned him around
and miracle of miracles
Led him to the Promised Land
When David slew Goliath, yes
That was a miracle
When God gave us manna
in the wilderness
That was a miracle too
But of all God's miracles
large and small
The most miraculous
one of all
Is the one I thought
could never be
God has given you
To me
Good day.
Hello, Sarah.
- Mazel tov, Chava.
- Thank you.
- Soon it will be you.
- I hope so.
- Give my best wishes to Tzeitel.
- I will.
No, don't... Please.
I just want to pass.
All right, stop it.
What's wrong with you, Fyedka?
- Just stop it.
- We're just having a little fun.
Good-bye, Sasha.
I said good-bye.
I'm sorry about that.
They mean no harm.
Don't they?
Is there something you want?
Yes. I'd like
to talk to you.
I'd rather not.
I've often noticed you
at the bookseller's.
Not many girls in this village
like to read.
Would you like to
borrow this book?
It's very good.
Thank you.
Why?
Because I'm not Jewish?
Do you feel about me...
the way they feel about you?
I didn't think you would.
And what do you
know about me, eh?
Let me tell you about myself.
I'm a pleasant fellow.
Charming...
honest, ambitious, quite bright...
and very modest.
Go ahead.
Take the book...
and after you return it...
I'll ask you how you like it...
and we can talk
about it for a while.
Then we can talk about life...
how we feel about things.
Here.
Thank you.
Good day, Chava.
Good day.
- Help!
- Tevye, what's the matter?
- Motel, Tzeitel, help!
- Wake up! What is the matter?
Wake up!
- Where is she?
- Where? Who?
- Where is she?
- What are you talking about?
Fruma Sarah,
Lazar Wolf's first wife.
She was standing here a minute ago.
What are you talking about?
Fruma Sarah's been dead for years.
Sha!
- You must have been dreaming.
- Yes.
Now...
tell me what you dreamt...
and I'll tell you what it meant.
- It was terrible.
- Tell me.
All right...
only don't be frightened!
In the beginning...
I dreamt that...
we were having...
a celebration of some kind.
Everybody we knew...
all of our beloved departed...
were there.
All of them...
even your
Great Uncle Mordechai...
was there...
and your cousin Rachel
was there.
And in the middle of the dream...
in walks your grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace.
Grandmother Tzeitel!
How did she look?
Well, for a woman
who's dead 30 years...
she looked very good.
Naturally, I went up
to greet her.
A blessing on your head
Mazel tov, mazel tov
To see a daughter wed
And such a son-in-law
Like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Kamzoil
A worthy boy is he
Of pious family
They named him after my
Dear Uncle Mordechai
The tailor Motel Kamzoil
Tailor?
She must have heard wrong.
- She meant the butcher.
- I'll tell her.
You must have heard wrong, Grandma
There's no tailor
You mean the butcher, Grandma
By the name of Lazar Wolf
No, no, no
I mean the tailor, Tevye
My great-grandchild
My little Tzeitel
who you named for me
Motel's bride was meant to be
For such a match I prayed
In heaven it was made
A fine upstanding boy
A comfort and a joy
The tailor Motel Kamzoil
- Stop it!
- We made a bargain with the butcher.
A blessing on your house
Imagine such a spouse
And such a son-in-law
like no one ever saw
The tailor Motel Kamzoil
- But he's a butcher!
- The tailor Motel Kamzoil
His name is Lazar Wolf!
The tailor Motel Kamzoil
- Look
- Who is this
- Who comes here
- Who, who
What woman is this
by righteous anger shaken
- Could it be
- Sure
- Yes, it could
- Why not
Who could be mistaken
It's the butcher's wife
come from beyond the grave
Oh, here she comes.
It's the butcher's dear
darling, departed wife
Fruma Sarah
What is this about your daughter
marrying my husband
Would you do this to your friend
and neighbor, Fruma Sarah
Have you no consideration
for a woman's feelings
Handing over my belongings
to a total stranger
How can you allow it, How can you
let your daughter take my place
Live in my house, carry my keys
And wear my clothes, pearls
How can you allow your daughter
to take her place
- Pearls
- House
- Pearls
- Keys
- Pearls
- Clothes
Such a learned man as Tevye
wouldn't let it happen
Tell me that it isn't true
and then I wouldn't worry
Say you didn't give your blessing
to your daughter's marriage
Let me tell you what would follow
such a fatal wedding
If Tzeitel marries Lazar Wolf
I pity them both
She'll live with him three weeks
And when three weeks are up
I'll come to her by night
I'll take her by the throat
This I'll give your Tzeitel
This I'll give your Tzeitel
Jump!
Here's my wedding present
If she marries Lazar Wolf
Oh, spirit, away!
Such an evil spirit.
May it sink back into the earth.
Such a dark and horrible dream.
It was brought on...
because you went
to see that butcher.
My grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace...
took the trouble to come
from the other world...
to tell us about the tailor.
All I can say is that it's for the best
and couldn't be any better.
- But, Golde...
- Amen.
Amen.
Do you like
these troublemakers?
- These Christ killers?
- Of course not.
I just meant that things have
been peaceful here.
I have other
villages to visit.
If you don't want to follow orders,
we shall get someone else who will.
No, sir.
I'll take care of it,
of course.
Quiet down!
Is this the little girl
I carried
Is this the little boy
at play
I don't remember
growing older
When did they
When did she get to be
A beauty
When did he grow
to be so tall
Wasn't it yesterday
When they were small
Sunrise, sunset
Swiftly flow the days
Seedlings turn overnight
To sunflowers
Blossoming even as we gaze
Swiftly fly the years
One season following
Another
Laden with happiness
And tears
What words of wisdom
Can I give them
How can I help
to ease their way
Now they must learn
From one another
Day by day
They look so natural
Together
Just like two
newlyweds should be
Is there a canopy in store
For me
Quiet down!
That was really beautiful.
Take your places, everybody.
Quiet! Quiet down!
The newlyweds.
Friends...
we are gathered here
to share in the joys...
of the newlyweds,
Motel and Tzeitel.
May they live together
to a ripe old age. Amen!
And now I want to say...
Please! Not here!
Now I'd like to announce
that the bride's parents...
are giving the newlyweds
the following:
a new feather bed...
two pillows...
Goose pillows.
A Sabbath tablecloth...
and a pair of candlesticks.
Quiet!
Now, we are just here on earth
for a short visit.
Even the great
and wealthy must die.
In fact, if the rich could
hire others to die for them...
we, the poor, would all
make a nice living.
Well put.
Lazar Wolf.
Talking about the rich.
There sits our
good friend Lazar Wolf.
Lazar has everything
in the world...
except a bride.
But Lazar has
no ill feelings.
In fact, he has
a gift for the newlyweds...
that he himself
wants to announce.
Come on, Lazar.
Just like he said...
I have no ill feelings.
What's done is done.
I am giving the newlyweds
five chickens...
one for each of the first
five Sabbaths...
of their wedded life.
Reb Lazar Wolf,
you are a decent man...
and on behalf
of my daughter...
and her new husband...
I accept your gift.
There is a famous
saying that...
I am not marrying your daughter.
I don't have to listen
to your sayings.
- If you would only listen...
- Why should I listen?
A man who breaks an agreement...
I have a right to talk!
What right?
It's not your wedding.
It should have been!
But it's not, thank goodness.
- Don't shame Tevye...
- He shamed me...
in front of the whole village.
He shamed me!
Rabbi, say something.
I say...
Yeah.
I say let's sit down.
Yes. Well, we all heard
the words of the rabbi.
Let's sit down.
Now I'm going
to sing a little song.
I don't want that.
Leave me alone.
You can keep your
diseased chickens!
You leave my chickens
out of this!
- We made a bargain!
- The terms weren't settled!
We drank on it!
Just sit down, all right?
Once a butcher,
always a butcher.
- Once a liar, always a liar.
- Sit down!
Those happen to be my chickens.
That man...
I had a sign!
Quiet, I'm singing.
Quiet!
What's all
the screaming about?
"They drank on it."
"An agreement."
"A sign."
It's all nonsense.
Tzeitel wanted to marry
Motel and not Lazar.
A young girl
decides for herself?
Why not?
They love each other.
- Love?
- Terrible.
- He's a radical.
- Musicians, play.
It's a dance. Everybody dance.
- It's a wedding!
- Some wedding.
- What is he doing?
- Who will dance with me?
- That's a sin.
- It's no sin to dance.
- But with a girl?
- Yes!
That's what comes of taking a wild man
into your house.
He's not a wild man!
He is a little bit different.
- Come on.
- It's a sin.
It's no sin.
Ask the rabbi.
Go on, ask him.
Well, rabbi?
Dancing?
- It's not exactly forbidden, but...
- Well, there you see!
- It's not forbidden!
- And it's no sin.
Now, who will dance with me?
He's asking her to dance!
It's only a dance, Mama.
Play!
Say something.
She's dancing with a man!
I can see that she's
dancing with a man!
And I'm going to dance
with my wife!
Mama, no!
- No, I will not.
- Tzeitel!
See that? You are
responsible for that...
and I can't stand it!
I tried my best!
Everybody dance!
Come on!
Dance, rabbi, dance!
All right! Enough!
I said enough!
Come!
Orders are orders,
you understand?
Well...
why are you all
standing around?
Clean up!
Tradition
Troubles, troubles.
That's all you hear from me, right?
But who else
can we simple people...
take our troubles to?
You know, sometimes I wonder.
Who do you take your troubles to?
Go away.
Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel
have been married for some time now.
They work very hard.
And...
they're as poor
as squirrels in winter.
But they're so happy
they don't know how miserable they are.
Motel keeps talking
about a sewing machine.
I know.
You are very busy now.
Wars, revolutions,
floods, plagues...
all those little things
that bring people back to you.
But couldn't you take a second
and get him his sewing machine?
And while you're in the neighborhood...
as you can see,
my horse's leg is...
Am I bothering you too much?
I'm sorry.
As the Good Book says...
Why should I tell you
what the Good Book says?
So you must go away?
Yes.
So soon?
Yes.
Tomorrow morning.
- Alone?
- No. With a few friends.
We'll be joining others.
- Where?
- In the city... Kiev.
Hodel, there are some things
I cannot tell even you.
I see.
Don't be upset.
Why should I be upset?
If you must leave, you must.
I do have to.
- So you've told me.
- Great changes are about to take place.
Tremendous changes.
But they can't happen
by themselves.
So you feel that you personally...
Not only me!
Many people!
Jews, Gentiles... many people hate
what's going on. Don't you understand?
I understand, of course.
You want to leave.
Then good-bye.
Hodel, listen to me!
I have work to do.
The greatest work
a man can do.
Don't you understand?
Yes, Perchik.
Wait!
There's a question...
a certain question
I wish to discuss with you.
- Yes?
- It's a political question.
- What is it?
- The question of marriage.
Is this a political question?
Well, yes.
Everything's political.
Like everything else, the relationship
between a man and a woman...
has a socioeconomic base.
Marriage must be founded
on mutual beliefs.
A common attitude
and philosophy towards society.
And affection?
Well, yes. Of course.
That is also necessary.
Such a relationship
can have positive social values.
When two people face the world
with unity and solidarity...
And affection!
Yes, that is an important element!
At any rate, l...
I personally am in favor
of such a socioeconomic relationship.
I think...
you're asking me to marry you.
Well...
in a theoretical sense.
Yes, I am.
I was hoping you were.
I'm very happy, Hodel.
I'm very, very happy.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.
I have some bad news.
- What?
- I must leave here.
- When?
- Tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry to hear that.
- We'll all miss you.
- But I also have some good news.
- Good.
- You can congratulate me.
- Congratulations. What for?
- We are engaged.
- Engaged?
- Yes, Papa. We're engaged.
No, you're not.
I know. You like him,
and he likes you.
But you're going away,
and you're staying here.
So have a nice trip.
I hope you'll be happy.
- And my answer is no!
- Please, Papa. You don't understand.
I understand.
I gave permission to Motel and Tzeitel,
so you feel you also have a right.
I'm sorry. I like you.
But you're going away.
So go in good health.
- And my answer is still no!
- You don't understand.
And you are not listening.
I said no!
Reb Tevye,
we're not asking for your permission.
Only for your blessing.
We are going to get married.
You are not asking
for my permission?
But we would like your blessing, Papa.
I can't believe my own ears.
My blessing? For what?
For going over my head
Impossible
At least with Tzeitel and Motel
They asked me
They begged me
But now, if I like it or not
You'll marry him
What do you want from me
Go on
Be wed
And tear out my beard
and uncover my head
Tradition
And not even asking permission
From the papa
What's happening to the tradition
One little time
I pulled out a thread
And where has it led
Where has it led? To this!
A man tells me he's getting married!
He doesn't ask me. He tells me!
But first he abandons you.
He's not abandoning me!
As soon as I can,
I'll send for her and marry her.
I love her.
He loves her.
Love.
It's a new style.
On the other hand...
our old ways
were once new, weren't they?
On the other hand,
they decided without parents...
without the matchmaker!
One the other hand...
did Adam and Eve
have a matchmaker?
Yes, they did.
And it seems these two
have the same matchmaker.
They're going over my head.
Unheard of. Absurd!
For this, they want to be blessed
Unthinkable
I'll lock her up in her room
I couldn't
I should
But look at my daughter's eyes
She loves him
Tradition
Well, children. I've decided to give you
my blessing and my permission!
Thank you, Papa!
- What else could I do?
- Thank you, Papa.
What am I going to tell your mother?
Another dream?
Perhaps if you tell her...
that I'm going to visit a rich uncle!
Perchik, please!
I can handle my own wife!
- Hello, Golde.
- Have some soup.
I have something
very important to tell you.
Have the soup.
It's warm.
- I've just met Perchik and Hodel.
- Well?
Well, they seem to be
very fond of each other.
So? What do you mean?
So...
So, I've decided to give them
my permission to become engaged.
- I'll eat later...
- What?
Just like that?
Without even asking me?
Who asks you?
- I'm the father!
- Who is he?
A pauper! He has absolutely nothing!
I wouldn't say that!
I hear he has a rich uncle.
A rich uncle!
Golde, he's a good man.
I like him. He's a little crazy,
but I like him.
And what's more important...
Hodel likes him.
Hodel loves him.
So what can we do?
It's a new world.
Love.
Do you love me
Do I what?
Do you love me
Do I love you
Well?
With our daughters getting married
and this trouble in the town
You're upset, you're worn-out
Go inside, go lie down
Maybe it's indigestion.
No, Golde.
I'm asking you a question.
Do you love me
- You're a fool!
- I know.
But do you love me
- Do I love you
- Well?
For 25 years
I've washed your clothes
Cooked your meals
cleaned your house
Given you children
milked your cow
After 25 years
why talk about love right now
The first time I met you
was on our wedding day
- I was scared
- I was shy
- I was nervous
- So was I
But my father and my mother
said we'd learn to love each other
And now I'm asking
Golde
Do you love me
- I'm your wife
- I know!
But do you love me
- Do I love him
- Well?
For 25 years
I've lived with him
Fought with him
starved with him
Twenty-five years
my bed is his
If that's not love, what is
Then you love me
I suppose I do
And I suppose I love you too
It doesn't change a thing
But even so
After 25 years
It's nice to
Know
Halt!
There is no authority
above the will of the people.
And we are the people!
We are Russia!
The time has come,
and the time is now.
We stand here before you,
not one, but many.
Many, like you...
students, workers...
striving for a better life.
And I urge you, fellow workers...
to band together with us.
Join our movement.
In the factories!
In the schools!
In the army!
The winds of freedom...
are beginning to blow
all over Russia!
Halt.
Wait! Stand!
Wait, fellow workers!
Don't let them break up our meeting!
We have our rights!
- So I found a girl...
- Good day to you, Esther.
She didn't like her.
Just a minute.
Tzeitel!
- Good day, Yente.
- Tzeitel!
I happened to stop in the post office
today to say hello... see what's what.
It doesn't cost anything
to be friendly.
So few people are like that.
People! I tell you,
if God lived on Earth...
people would break his windows.
- So you went to the post office?
- The postman told me...
there was a letter
for your sister Hodel.
- Thanks. I'll go get it.
- I got it.
It's from her intended, Perchik.
Hodel will be so happy. She's been
waiting to hear from him for...
- But it's opened.
- So it happened to be opened.
You don't have to wait
for the train.
You'll be late for your customers.
It's all right.
They'll just have to wait
for a while.
Is he in bad trouble...
that hero of yours?
Arrested?
- Convicted?
- Yes. But he did nothing wrong.
He cares nothing for himself.
Everything he does
is for other people.
But if he did nothing wrong,
he wouldn't be in trouble.
Oh, Papa. How can you say that?
What wrongs did Joseph do?
And Abraham? And Moses?
And they had troubles.
Yes, but...
But why won't you tell me...
where he is now,
this Joseph of yours?
It is far, Papa.
Terribly far.
He is in a settlement in Siberia.
And he asks you
to leave your father and mother...
and join him in that frozen wasteland...
and marry him there?
No, Papa.
He did not ask me to go.
I want to go.
I don't want him to be alone.
I want to help him in his work.
How can I hope to make you understand
Why I do
What I do
Why I must travel
to a distant land
Far from the home I love
Once I was happily content to be
As I was
Where I was
Close to the people
who are close to me
Here in the home I love
Who could see that a man would come
Who would change the shape
of my dreams
Helpless now
I stand with him
Watching
Older dreams grow dim
Oh, what a melancholy choice this is
Wanting home
Wanting him
Closing my heart
to every hope but his
Leaving the home I love
There where my heart
has settled long ago
I must go
Who could imagine
I'd be wandering so
Far from the home I love
Yet
There with my love
I'm home
And who, my child will there be...
to perform a marriage...
there in the wilderness?
Papa, I promise you.
We will be married under a canopy.
Yes.
No doubt, a rabbi or two...
were also arrested.
Papa!
God alone knows
when we shall see each other again.
Then we will leave it in his hands.
Take care of her.
See that she dresses warm.
Even though she only
burned his cooking...
he is permitted to divorce her!
- Just for supper?
- That's what it says.
- I'm sorry, Rabbi...
- Yes, of course.
What news of the outside world, Avram?
- It's terrible!
- Then don't tell me!
If I want bad news,
I'll read about Noah and the flood.
Tell me, Avram.
Surely somewhere
there are good things happening?
Can't you buy a paper
that prints those things?
It's not my fault!
I only read it!
- Rabbi! Did you hear the news?
- More bad news?
No! Good news!
At Motel and Tzeitel's! A new arrival!
We just heard the good news!
Mazel tov!
Thank you very much.
- It's a nice thing.
- Yes, it is.
- Very nice.
- Thank you.
- What is it?
- It's a sewing machine!
It can work twice as fast.
You got it!
I got it!
- It's beautiful.
- I know.
- Have you tried it yet?
- Look!
- Beautiful!
- I know!
And in less than a minute!
See how close and even the stitches are?
- It's beautiful!
- I know!
From now on my clothes will be perfect!
Made by machine!
No more handmade clothes!
Look, Mama!
It's wonderful!
The rabbi!
Rabbi, is there a blessing
for a sewing machine?
There is a blessing for everything.
That's your new arrival?
What is it, a boy or a girl?
Well put.
Yankeleh!
Why isn't he asleep?
Oh, Mama. But he's wonderful!
He never cries or any...
Do you want to invite bad luck?
Well, Motel!
I never thought
you'd amount to anything.
But look at you!
A baby, a new sewing machine.
You're a person.
- I'll show you how it works.
- Go, children!
First you put the cloth in, like this.
It's an amazing thing. You work it
with your foot and your hand.
Your father is coming.
Chava, let me talk to him.
Let me tell him about us.
No, Fyedka.
That would be the worst thing.
- But let me try!
- No!
I'll talk to him.
I promise.
Good afternoon, sir.
Good afternoon.
It's a cold day, isn't it?
Well...
Good day, sir.
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.
What were you and he talking about?
Nothing. We were just talking.
Good.
Papa!
Fyedka and l... We've known each other
for a long time now.
Chaveleh...
I would be much happier...
if you would remain friends
from a distance.
You must not forget who you are...
and who that man is.
- He has a name, Papa.
- Of course.
All creatures on Earth
have a name.
Fyedka's not a creature, Papa.
- Fyedka is a man!
- Who says he isn't?
It's just that he's
a different kind of man.
As the Good Book says...
"Each shall seek his own kind."
In other words,
a bird may love a fish...
but where would they build
a home together?
- The world is changing, Papa!
- No, Chaveleh.
No.
Some things do not change for us.
Some things will never change.
We don't feel that way.
"We"?
Fyedka and I.
We want to be married.
What? Are you out of your mind?
What?
Don't you understand what that means,
marrying outside of the faith?
- But, Papa!
- No!
I said no!
Never talk about it again.
Never mention his name again.
Never see him again.
Never.
Do you understand me?
Yes, Papa.
I understand you.
You're finally here!
Let's go home. It's late.
I want to see Motel's new machine.
See it another time!
It's late!
Quiet, woman, before I get angry!
Because when I'm angry,
even flies don't dare to fly!
I'm very frightened of you.
After we finish supper I'll faint.
I am the man in the house!
I'm the head of the family!
And I want to see
Motel's new machine now!
Now let's go home!
What are you doing here?
What do you want?
May I see His Honor the Priest?
- The Reverend Father?
- Yes.
Why do you want to see him?
It's a family matter.
A personal matter.
- My daughter.
- Yes? What about your daughter?
Please, if I could speak with the pr...
If I could speak with
the Reverend Father.
Please!
Wait here.
What is it?
It's Chava.
She left home this morning...
with Fyedka.
What?
I've looked everywhere for her.
I even went to the priest.
He told me they were married.
Married?
Yes.
Well...
go home, Golde.
We have other children at home.
You have work to do.
I have work to do.
- Go home.
- But Chaveleh!
Chava is dead to us!
We'll forget her.
Go home.
Little bird
Little Chaveleh
I don't understand
what's happening today
Everything is all a blur
All I can see is a happy child
The sweet little bird you were
Chaveleh
Little bird
Little Chaveleh
You were always such
a pretty little thing
Everybody's favorite child
Gentle and kind and affectionate
What a sweet little bird you were
Chaveleh
Papa.
Papa, I've been looking
everywhere for you.
Papa, stop!
At least listen to me.
Papa!
I beg you to accept us!
Accept them?
How can I accept them?
Can I deny everything
I believe in?
On the other hand...
can I deny my own daughter?
On the other hand...
how can I turn my back on my faith?
My people?
If I try and bend that far...
I'll break.
On the other hand...
No!
There is no other hand!
No, Chava!
But, Papa!
Golde, here they are!
The boys I told you about!
Wonderful boys!
From good families!
Each of them a prize, a jewel!
You couldn't do better
for your girls.
I don't know, Yente.
My girls are still so young.
So what do they look like?
Grandfathers?
True, the marriage can wait.
But meanwhile their future
will be all signed and sealed!
Which one for which one?
What's the difference?
Take your pick.
They're both wonderful boys!
Yankel, the fat one,
is apprenticed to a carpenter.
- I'm Yankel.
- Did I ask you?
- Yankel, the skinny one, is...
- Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?
He's in the barn.
Is there trouble?
Stay inside, children.
What is it?
What's the matter?
Tevye, have you seen
the constable lately?
- No. Why?
- There's some rumors in town.
We thought since you knew him so well...
maybe he told you what is true
and what is not.
Rumors? What rumors?
Quiet! Talk, Avram.
Someone from Zolodin said an edict
was issued in St. Petersburg that...
Welcome, Your Honor.
- What's the good news in the world?
- I see that you have company.
They are my friends.
It's just as well.
What I have to say
is for their ears also.
How much time do you need
to sell your house and household goods?
Why should I sell my house?
Is it in anybody's way?
I came to tell you
you have to leave Anatevka.
And how did I come
to deserve such an honor?
Not just you.
But all of you.
Stop it!
I thought you might be spared because
of the marriage of your daughter.
My daughter is dead.
I understand.
At any rate, it affects all of you.
You all have to leave.
But this corner of the world...
has always been our home.
Why should we leave?
I don't know why. There's trouble
in the world! Troublemakers!
- Like us?
- You aren't the only ones.
Your people must leave
all the villages: Zolodin, Rabalevka...
The entire district must be emptied!
I have an order here!
You must sell your homes
and be out in three days.
Three days! It's impossible!
The children!
And you!
You who have known us
all your life...
you'd carry out this order?
I've nothing to do with it!
Don't you understand?
I wish you wouldn't say "me"!
I understand.
Suppose we refuse to go?
You will be forced out!
- We will defend ourselves.
- We'll stay in our homes.
- We won't move!
- We'll keep our land!
- Fight!
- Against our militia? Our army?
- I wouldn't advise that!
- I have some advice for you.
Get off my land.
This is still my home...
my land.
Get off my land.
You have three days!
After a lifetime...
a piece of paper,
and get thee out.
Let's get together
with the people of Zolodin.
- Maybe they have a plan.
- We should defend ourselves!
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth!
Very good. That way the whole world
will be blind and toothless.
Rabbi...
we've been waiting for the Messiah
all our lives.
Wouldn't this be a good time
for him to come?
We'll have to wait for him
someplace else.
Meanwhile, let's start packing.
Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been
the Garden of Eden.
That's true.
After all, what have we got here?
A little bit of this
A little bit of that
- A pot
- A pan
- A broom
- A hat
Someone should have set a match
to this place years ago.
- A bench
- A tree
- What's a house
- Or a stove
People who pass through Anatevka
don't even know they've been here.
A stick of wood
A piece of cloth
What do we leave
Nothing much
Only Anatevka
Underfed, overworked
Anatevka
Where else would Sabbath
Be so sweet
Intimate, obstinate
Where I know
Everyone I meet
Soon I'll be a stranger
In a strange, new place
Searching for
An old familiar face
From Anatevka
I belong in Anatevka
Tumbledown, workaday
Dear little village
Little town
Of
Mine
It's just a place.
Our forefathers have been forced out
of many places at a moment's notice.
Maybe that's why...
we always wear our hats.
Golde, darling!
I had to see you before I left.
Because I have such news for you.
You remember I told you
I didn't know where to go...
what do to with these old bones?
Now I know. You wanna hear?
I'll tell you.
All my life I've dreamed
of going to one place.
Guess where.
You'll never guess.
Every year at Passover,
what do we say?
"Next year in Jerusalem."
"Next year in the Holy Land."
You're going to the Holy Land!
You guessed.
Good-bye, Yente.
Be well...
and go in peace.
So good-bye. And sometime maybe
we'll meet on a happier occasion.
Meanwhile we suffer.
Oh, we suffer!
We suffer in silence.
Right? Of course, right.
Where are you going?
You don't know where you're going?
Come, Golde. We have to leave.
Leave. It sounds so easy.
Golde, we'll all be together soon.
Motel, Tzeitel and the baby...
they'll come too.
You'll see. This Motel is a person.
And Hodel and Perchik?
When will we ever see them again?
Do they visit us from Siberia
every Sabbath?
You know what she writes.
He sits in prison. She works.
But soon he'll be set free.
And together they'll turn the world
upside-down.
She couldn't be happier.
And the other children will be with us.
Not all.
AII!
Come, Golde.
I have to clean up.
Sweep the floor.
I don't want to leave a dirty house!
I'm on my way.
Where are you going?
Chicago, in America.
We are going to New York, America.
We'll be neighbors.
My wife, Fruma Sarah, may she
rest in peace, has a brother there.
- That's nice.
- I hate him!
But...
a relative is a relative.
- Good-bye, Tevye.
- Good-bye, Lazar Wolf.
Well, my old friends.
It's time to say good-bye.
The farmer Busenko
will be coming for you later.
He's not a bad sort.
If you are good to him,
he'll be good to you.
Take care of your leg.
Thanks for everything.
- Papa will see you.
- I want him to.
I want to say good-bye to him.
- He won't listen to you.
- But at least he will hear.
Maybe it would be better
if I told Mama.
Papa?
We came to say good-bye.
We're also leaving this place.
We're going to Krakow.
We cannot stay among people
who do such things to others.
We wanted you to know that.
Some are driven away by edicts...
others, by silence.
Good-bye, Papa.
Mama.
Come, Chava.
Good-bye, Chava, Fyedka!
And God be with you.
And God be with you.
We will write to you in America
if you like.
We will be staying with Uncle Avram!
Yes, Mama!
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram"!
The whole world
has to know our business!
Stop yelling, and finish packing!
We have a long way to go!
Golde, I don't need your advice!
Tzeitel, don't forget the baby!
Good-bye, Papa.
Work hard, Motel.
And come to us soon.
I will, Papa.
I'll work hard.
All right, children.
Let's go.
