You're listening to Tyneside 247,
England's number one radio station...
...with the very best in American sounds.
If you've just arrived in town,
you may be wondering, "What's going on?"
I can tell you, this is America Week,
day four, with lots more fun in store.
All right, Thursday afternoon
at St. James' Park, there's a lark.
I'm talking a real American rodeo...
...followed by the US Marine Band...
...with their tribute to John Philip Sousa.
After that, the Marine Strike Unit
in combat simulation. Should be fun.
Coca-Cola is sponsoring an exhibition of
space technology at the science museum.
"A giant step for mankind?"
Is that a question mark? No, it's not.
There's American football every day
on the town, as well as basketball...
...volleyball, handball, baseball.
Children, it's gonna be a ball.
The history of the American patchwork quilt
is at the Women's Institute.
The City Art Gallery is running an exhibition...
...called Hopper to Pollock.
Sounds like a train.
Hopper to Pollock, Hopper to Pollock.
- Hello?
- Kate?
Who is this?
This is Bob. We haven't met yet.
I just took over from Elliot Johnson.
What happened to Elliot?
He's back in New York. It was a sudden thing.
I've been trying to contact you since last night.
I was at work.
You have anotherjob?
I have no record of this. No contact number.
Elliot has my number. What is it you want?
Mr. Cosmo rang. He has a job for you.
It's tomorrow.
He says to buy a new outfit. Everything new.
I can't. I need more notice than that.
I have to work tomorrow.
Kate, I understood from Mr. Cosmo
that you were one of the team.
That's what Mr. Cosmo said,
"Kate works with us," right?
I guess so.
Every movie theatre in town
is showing American movies...
Take your pick from Oklahoma,
West Side Story, On The Waterfront...
...The Girl Can't Help lt, Jailhouse Rock,
Invasion Of The Body Snatchers...
...Cat On A Hot Tin Roof, I, The Jury,
Casablanca, Some Like It Hot...
...Chinatown, In The Heat Of The Night,
The French Connection I and II...
...Godfather I and II, The Blob,
A Night At The Opera, The Big Country...
...Citizen Kane, Giant, Bonnie and Clyde,
Saturday Night Fever, The Long Goodbye...
...Easy Rider,
and the first road movie, Stagecoach.
Any shop with an American Week poster
in the window will sell you at half price...
...any item made in the USA
if you're wearing your "I Love America" badge.
- Do you take credit cards?
- Yes, we do.
I'll take this one also.
Sorry.
News headlines: One of the key figures
in the America Week festival...
...Texas businessman Francis Cosmo,
was at the center of another political row...
...when opposition councilor Stanley Higgins
accused both Mr. Cosmo and the mayoress...
...of showing callous disregard for local heritage.
Mr. Cosmo heads IBBD consortium,
which plans...
...to redevelop several prime riverside properties.
In their rights, my ass.
In their rights? You must be joking.
I'm within my rights.
That's my right!
Bastard!
Here's an oddball item.
Positively the only place in town
that's not going American...
...is the Key Club down on the Quayside.
Maybe they're trying to tell us something,
because on Saturday night...
...for one night only, the Krakow Jazz Ensemble...
...that's Krakow, Poland, not Pennsylvania,
will be doing their only UK gig.
To be honest with you, boys and girls...
...this is one group I'm not familiar with.
This is a track underneath me
from their current album, but...
...unfortunately the sleeve notes are in Polish,
so I can't tell you what it's called.
Here they are, the Krakow Jazz Ensemble...
...with Schneeski, Schnorski, Schnitski.
And that's just the drummer!
- Hello. Can I help you?
- Yes, is Mr. Finney in?
- What?
- Mr. Finney.
- He's on the phone. What was it about?
- It's about the cleaning job.
- The cleaning job?
- The cleaning job.
To me, drumming ought to be
a subtle and delicate art.
Shouldn't sound like
falling down the stairs with a drum kit.
Has he listened to Dave Tough?
- It's someone about the job.
- Show her in, Jean.
- Actually, it's...
- Show her in.
I'm sorry, Roy, I know I penciled you in,
but that's why it was a pencil.
No, I won't change my mind.
Don't lose your sense of humor.
Wanker.
- Who the fuck are you?
- I've come for the job.
"Key Club, cleaning person wanted."
If I wanted a bloke, I'd have said so.
Farewell Blues.
- What did you say?
- Farewell Blues.
Eddie Condon, Wild Bill Davison, Dave Tough.
Who was on bass?
- Jim Lanigan?
- Wrong! Jack Lesberg.
Hello, Finney, Key Club.
Mr. Slominski.
I wasn't expecting you till Saturday,
Mr. Slominski.
Sit down, would you?
Couldn't you stay the night in Amsterdam?
It's American Week here in Newcastle.
Everything's booked up.
Get into a couple of cabs,
I'll pay for them down here.
What do you mean?
Christ. Put him on.
Hello.
Mr. Brown of Customs and lmmigration here.
I have with me a Mr. Slominski...
...who assures me that he and his colleagues...
...have a contract to appear
at your nightclub for one night.
Unfortunately,
they don't have any documentation.
Somebody will have to present
documentation to me...
...here at the airport
before I can release their baggage.
Thank you, Mr. Finney.
Jesus Christ.
Jean!
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't. It's Brendan.
- Got a driving license?
- Yeah.
Jean!
I'll give you two jobs.
You can clean the club,
which is a dubious privilege...
...but first I need a band picking up
from the airport.
The Krakow Jazz Ensemble?
- You've heard of them?
- I just heard them on the radio.
- You like them?
- Yeah. They're good.
I think so, too.
Jean!
What?
The frigging Poles have landed a day early.
My God.
- Where am I going to put them?
- Not with me this time.
- Where am I gonna put them?
- Royal Station Hotel, 50 pounds a night.
What the hell? Do it.
Give Brendan the keys to the Transit,
a Xerox for the contract...
...and some money from petty cash for petrol.
- Thanks.
- Get a receipt for everything you pay for.
This is a security announcement.
Please do not leave
your baggage unattended at anytime.
If you see an unattended bag,
do not attempt to move it.
Contact airport security immediately.
Thank you.
- Did the boys from London show up?
- Not yet.
Did you speak to Kate?
She'll be there at 1:00.
We're going to be late.
She'll wait.
Mr. Cosmo, this is Peter Reed.
He's responsible for the overall planning.
How do you do, Peter? It looks fantastic.
Looks wonderful. We need more flags.
A lot more flags. More stars, more stripes.
On this wall, what do you say...
...we put a large photograph of
the President of the United States?
Over here, perhaps,
another one of your own Prime Minister.
- Great idea.
- Good man. Do it.
Let's have a look at the ballroom.
Nice chandelier, Peter. French?
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
We are the Krakow Jazz Ensemble.
- Do you have any reservations?
- Yes, Mr. Finney, from the Key Club.
- He phoned about an hour ago.
- One moment please.
- She's nice.
- Lovely.
Is everybody coming?
Anybody turn down the invitation?
Only three.
Chairman of the Housing Committee.
That bastard, good.
Alderman Thorpe is in the hospital.
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- Terminal.
And Mr. Ferguson is on vacation.
- Who's Ferguson?
- The union guy, the helpful one.
Yeah, right. You're late, baby.
I've been waiting for an hour.
I went for a cup of coffee.
Then I should apologize.
We were held up at Heathrow. Fog.
It's all part of the British tradition.
Let me look at you.
Katie, you look beautiful.
Bob here tells me
you've been having a good time.
New friends, different faces.
You haven't met Bob, have you?
Katie, this is Bob.
Bob, this is my little Katie.
Been trying to picture you from your voice.
- Pretty as a picture, isn't she, Bob?
- She sure is, Mr. Cosmo.
Bob's taking over for Elliot.
Elliot did something very stupid.
Went to bed with a journalist.
Bob here's taken over,
and Bob always sleeps alone.
- Don't you, Bob?
- Yes, sir, Mr. Cosmo.
Don't get me wrong, Katie.
This guy's no faggot, are you, Bob?
No, sir.
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.
Alone.
What time are we supposed
to meet what's-his-name?
Councilor Perry's
waiting for us in the office now.
Katie, can it wait until tomorrow?
Until after the lunch,
then you and I can go someplace...
...nice and intimate and talk and talk?
Okay?
Mustn't keep what's-his-name waiting.
More flags, Peter.
Talk, talk, talk.
- What's the guy's name again?
- Councilor Perry.
- No, his first name.
- John.
John.
- John, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- How was the flight?
- Tedious. The usual.
Keep your seat.
We sit on ceremony in this office.
Bob has filled me in on the report.
It looks good, John.
Excellent work.
I'll read it carefully tonight.
Is there gonna be any problem
with the Housing Committee?
I'm absolutely sure the vote will go in favor.
The job re-creation angle is enough to ensure it.
There were three or four holding out against it.
But we did a deal over central heating
in the tenement buildings.
I think it will be a blanket vote.
- You're sure of this, John?
- Absolutely sure.
That's good work.
Anything negative at this point and...
...the project becomes
another British "almost happened."
The company takes off for Rotterdam orAntwerp.
Quite so. I'm sure it will never come to that.
And is our friend still being difficult?
Goddamn it, let's have some champagne.
No deal yet, Chris.
Tell him to go fuck himself. Good-bye.
Wonderful, isn't it?
I can't understand how someone
could turn down so much money.
I've done the floor, Mr. Finney. What's next?
You're late. If you can't make it on time, leave.
- It's a job. Turn up on time.
- I tried to get a cab.
Don't give me any crap about a cab, okay?
You're late, we're busy.
Get changed. This is happy hour.
Okay.
Can I have the clam chowder, please?
I wouldn't, it's not very good.
- Hi.
- Hello.
- What do you recommend?
- The steak's good.
Right, I'll have a steak.
- English?
- What do you mean?
- Burned?
- Medium.
- French fries?
- Yes, please.
- Side salad?
- Yes.
- Beer or California wine?
- Beer.
Schlitz, Bud, Pabst, Colt,
Carlsberg or Heineken?
- Guinness?
- Nope.
Bud.
It'll be ready in about ten minutes.
I'll bring you your beer first.
There you go, sir.
- Clam chowder, is it hot?
- It can be.
- Is there plenty?
- I can give you a double portion.
Do it.
- Would you like anything on the side?
- A couple of large whiskeys, ice, no water.
Bring them straight away.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Sit on my face.
- They want it hot.
- Put a couple of drops of that in it.
You get through to the Yank?
It's tomorrow afternoon.
- We hit him at the Key Club?
- That's where he's at.
To hurt him or kill him?
Hurt him. We need his signature.
I don't bother with jerks. They never tip well.
I'll get you your change.
I'm off at midnight.
- Hey, Brendan.
- Yeah.
- Is Mr. Finney in?
- He's gone.
He's at his other club, The Precinct.
- Where's that?
- It's around the corner on the Quayside.
Right.
It's important I talk to Mr. Finney.
He's my boss. I work for him.
- Are you a member?
- No.
I'm afraid you can't, it's members only tonight.
Besides which, you're not wearing a suit,
so we wouldn't let you in anyway.
Improperly dressed, to be precise.
Good night, sir. Good night, ma'am.
It's very important I talk to Mr. Finney.
Are you gonna fuck off,
or is he going to plant you?
I do hate violence.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What do you want to do?
Can we go around the corner for a drink?
Something's come up.
Have to see this guy, my boss.
Sounds complicated.
Do you not want me to come?
Of course I want you to come.
- Shall we sit at the bar?
- Sure.
- What's your name?
- Brendan.
- Kate.
- Suits you.
What would you like, Kate?
I'll have a malt whiskey.
- Hi, what can I get you?
- What malts do you have?
Aultmore, Cardhu, Clynelish, Glenesk,
Glen Elgin, Glenleven, Glenury Royal...
...Lagavulin, Linkwood, Lochnagar, Oban,
Strathconan and Talisker.
Glenleven.
- Two?
- Yeah.
- With ice?
- No, thank you.
Gosh, what a day.
I like it here.
Cheers.
It's hot in here.
We should try a different one each time.
Okay, you choose.
I'm sorry I knocked you over.
You did, didn't you?
Actually...
"Actually." It's very British.
Actually, that was one of the nicer things
that happened to me today.
What was bad then?
- Those two guys in the restaurant?
- No, I'm used to jerks like them.
Two Taliskers coming up.
They're probably easiest to deal with.
If it wasn't me, and it wasn't them...
I have this otherjob, and I'm under contract...
...and it's gotten kind of heavy.
I don't know.
I'll tell you about it some other time.
What about you? What do you do?
I work at the Key Club.
Just around the corner, jazz club.
It sounds nice.
What do you do there?
I look after the band, that sort of thing.
- Have you been there a long time?
- Yeah.
How long?
About 14 and a half hours.
I'm the cleaner...
...but I'm looking after
this Polish band for a couple of days.
- The Krakow Jazz Ensemble?
- That's right.
I heard them on the radio this morning.
They sound kind of crazy.
What part of the States are you from?
I've lived in New York for about a year now.
What did you do there?
I was a waitress. An actress between jobs.
- And here, in between being a waitress?
- Sort of an actress.
And before that?
New Ulm, Minnesota, okay?
- New what?
- New Ulm. N-E-W U-L-M.
- That makes you Norwegian.
- Half, my mother.
That's very perceptive of you.
How did you know that?
I've been around.
I traveled across the States a couple of years ago.
I stayed two weeks in Minnesota.
- Yeah? It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It's fantastic.
If I had the money, I'd go back tomorrow.
So would I.
- Do your parents still live there?
- No, my parents are dead.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Great record.
Wanna dance?
I haven't danced like this for a long time.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
It's Finney.
- Will you wait for me?
- Yeah.
Good luck.
Paper, sir?
Did you notice a bloke
just come out of there with a blonde?
Do you know where he's gone? Thank you.
Sir, it's Brendan, Mr. Finney.
- What do you want, Brendan?
- Could I talk to you for a minute?
- No, I'm busy.
- It's very urgent, Mr. Finney.
Tomorrow, Brendan.
Some men are going to try and hurt you.
Something to do with an American.
Come to my house in the morning.
About 8:30. That's my address there.
Get a cab. It's a matter of timing, you know?
Thanks.
Say good night to Brendan.
- Good night, Brendan.
- Good night.
- Brendan?
- Yeah?
Don't forget the receipt.
- Did you find him?
- Yeah, but he was busy.
Let's go, folks. We're closing up.
- How much do I owe you?
- It's done.
- Did you pay?
- Maybe.
Good night.
See you again.
Nice place.
- Would you like some coffee?
- No.
I'm kind of tired. Are you?
Yeah.
Do you have a shirt, or something I could wear?
Yeah.
Do you mind if we just lie here together?
No, I don't mind.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.
It's nice.
Can I turn the lights out?
Yeah.
Can I see you later?
I have to work. I don't know when I'll be done.
If I can, I'll be at the restaurant.
What if you can't?
Then I'll find you.
One moment, please. Mr. Reed?
Telephone.
Hello, Peter Reed speaking.
Yes, we're expecting them this morning.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Absolutely tragic.
How awful.
I hate to ask you this,
but do you have a replacement?
I see, right.
Thank you for letting me know.
They've crashed on the motorway.
We don't have a band, and it's too late
to find a replacement. Great.
There is a band staying in the hotel.
They checked in yesterday.
I'm afraid they're foreign, though.
Hello, I've come to see Mr. Finney.
He said to come about 8:30.
Wait here.
He'll be down in a moment.
Come through.
Breakfast, sir.
Come in.
Mr. Slominski, good morning.
I wonder if I might have a word with you.
What was it you wanted
to talk to my husband about?
It's something that came up last night.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
There's fresh coffee.
Talk to me.
No thanks, sir.
After I left the club last night, about 8:30...
...I went around the corner for something to eat.
A place called Weegees.
I know it.
It was quite full at the time.
At the table next to me,
there were these two heavy-looking blokes.
They mentioned the club.
They mentioned your name.
One of them said,
"It's tomorrow, in the afternoon."
The other one said, "Hurt him or..."
Or what?
"Or kill him?" It was a question.
"Hurt him or kill him?"
- What was the answer?
- There was a lot of noise.
- Are you setting me up?
- No, Mr. Finney.
Do you know who that is?
No.
- What do they want?
- They want me to sell the club.
I don't want to.
I just don't like being pushed around.
The band is playing the Polish Club tonight.
Jean's got the address.
I want them there by 8:00, no later. Okay?
Right. Okay.
John, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
Councilor, I'd like you to meet Katie.
Katie, this is John.
- Hello.
- Pleased to meet you.
Katie's one of my best friends.
- Mr. Cosmo?
- Yeah?
Excuse me, I've got a lot of fires to put out.
Drink?
It is a great honor...
...to be asked to welcome
ourAmerican friends today.
It is also a great pleasure.
I am confident that we are ushering in...
...a new era of transatlantic...
...cooperation and friendship...
...and, last but not least, of prosperity.
The qualities that have made America...
...the richest, the most powerful...
...and, in my opinion, the most benevolent
superpower in history...
...those qualities will, I hope, be transmitted...
...to our own British initiative...
...and contribute towards
a re-emergence of this once-great nation.
One of our most misrepresented...
...or shall I say misunderstood,
presidents once said:
"When the going gets tough,
the tough get going."
And when I look at England...
...in particular this area, this once-great area...
...I can see that the going is tough.
I can also see that it is time
the tough got going.
This area requires major surgery.
The surgeon's knife may seem crude...
...but you ask any cancer victim
who has survived...
...and he will sing a little song called
God Save the Surgeon.
You can sign for me, or you can sign for him.
Sign, please.
You shouldn't have damaged the desk.
You shouldn't have done that.
Tony!
Come in, Brendan.
It's time you had an education.
I know who you are...
...Tony.
You were in Durham eight years ago.
Did you make these in the workshop?
Search them.
That's a nice car, Tony.
Brendan, give this man a pound, would you?
Go on.
You just sold him your car.
Patrick.
I hate guns, Patrick.
If you come back here...
...l'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Billy, bring the van round the front,
would you?
Right.
Let's get it over with.
Sounds tough, but it is tough.
I think it's true that any man
who wants to provide for his family...
...wants his children to have a good education...
We have a 20 percent
unemployment situation here.
- Is it as bad in the States?
- No, everybody who wants to work can.
I think a realistic figure would be eight percent.
A lot of people just don't want to work at all...
...even ifjobs are offered.
You can't live on handouts or social benefits.
Is it cruel?
- What the hell's going on?
- They are a reputable band.
Reputable band, my ass.
You shut those motherfuckers up.
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the guard speaking.
This is the retimed 1720
from Newcastle to London King's Cross.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen.
I've got to go somewhere tonight.
I want you to come with me.
Can you do that?
Can I please have the night off?
Sure, take a year off. You're fired.
- I'm fired?
- Fired.
- I've been a bad, bad girl.
- Get in the car.
- Where did you get the car?
- I've been a bad, bad boy.
- Where'd you get the car?
- Just get in.
I'll tell you on the way.
It's so strange.
Cosmo?
Yeah.
Mr. Cosmo, it's Tony. I'm back in London.
Finney turned us round.
Get Bob.
That was pretty good for a Norwegian.
My father was Polish.
I used to spend a lot of time
with my grandparents.
And that place reminded me of all of that.
- I'm not a very nice person to know.
- Yes, you are.
You don't know what you're getting yourself into.
I don't care.
What do you want?
I want you.
Why?
Andrej, we're going.
- Okay, I think I'll stay for a while.
- Okay.
Let's go home.
Brendan, what's this?
With one day left to the America Week festival,
record profits have been reported by shops...
...possibility that the festival
could become a regular event...
All the major airlines report higher than average
bookings on the main routes.
Both British Airways and TWA
are fully booked until next week.
Your tire!
Your tire's running down!
- Why are we stopping?
- The tire.
Where'd you get the car, you fuck?
Get up.
What are you doing?
Let go of me!
They're in this together...
...your Kate, and Finney's man.
His name's Brendan.
He's a pro. They seem real close.
Nobody said anything about guns.
They've got guns, and I think we need guns.
That's smart thinking, Bob. Real smart thinking.
All the money I spend,
and you want to play Al Capone...
...with some fucking meatball.
You fucking juvenile!
Grow up, Bob. We're gentlemen.
We can't be shooting people.
We're supposed to improve
the quality of life, create jobs...
...and make a lot of money.
First thing you do is lose the body.
Throw it in the river.
He never existed.
Next thing you do, go to the club.
Say I want to talk to Finney.
Set up a meeting.
And be polite.
Don't fuck up, Bob.
Andrej Slominski's key, please.
- One of the musicians, is he?
- Yeah.
- Please?
- 109.
Thank you.
Good night.
Thanks for coming, Mr. Finney.
I truly appreciate it.
I'm sure we can resolve this misunderstanding.
Cut the crap. I'm not the Council.
I know all about you, Cosmo.
I know about the legitimate business
in New York...
...the not-so-legitimate business
in New Orleans...
...the Senate inquiry.
I've done my homework, Mr. Cosmo.
- You have not done your homework.
- You're right. That was foolish of me.
Maybe you thought it wasn't necessary.
You come here
with a bank full of money to launder.
I heard the stories.
You worked your act and I thought:
"Sooner or later,
he's gonna come make me an offer."
I was prepared all along to consider.
So what do you do?
You send two employees.
They were insensitive.
So I said no.
Then what do you do?
Councilor Perry? Pressure.
I have a photograph of Perry
with a friend of mine.
He's in my pocket.
You've made too many assumptions
about the people in this town.
They're taking you for every penny
they can lay their fingers on.
Hell, I know that. I'm playing them, too.
The trouble is, I can't do everything myself.
It's difficult to find the right partners.
Maybe we can discuss some kind of cooperation.
Do we understand each other?
- I think we're getting there, Mr. Cosmo.
- It's Frank.
- I'll stick with Mr. Cosmo for now.
- Fine.
If you want the club, make me an offer
that doesn't insult my intelligence.
- Mr. Slominski?
- Who is it?
It's the chambermaid here.
Can I clean your room?
Did you mean what you said?
What did I say?
- I meant it. Did you?
- Yeah.
Did you know those guys?
They work for Cosmo.
Do you?
I did.
What'll happen now?
They'll try to have us killed.
Do you want to come to Minnesota with me?
- I don't have any money.
- I have money.
I don't think that they'll try and do anything here.
I'll take the car and I'll get our things.
What time does it get dark?
9:30? 10:00? I'll meet you at 11:00.
Brendan.
I don't have to tell you
what kind of trouble you're in, do I?
You're a smart girl.
You can figure it out for yourself.
What's-his-name is still singing soprano.
I kind of enjoyed that.
And you've got yourself an Irish boyfriend.
You love him, don't you?
Don't you?
Yes.
Well, then...
...you want to keep him alive, don't you?
Yeah.
So get him out of town.
Take your Brendan...
...and the red car, and drive to London tonight.
There are two tickets to New York...
...and one to Minneapolis, St. Paul...
...in your name at the TWA desk.
Use those tickets, Katie.
Use them because life is short,
and because we have to live it.
We were close, weren't we?
Don't.
Ladies and gentlemen, before we start tonight,
I'd like to say a couple of words.
I opened the club 10 years ago now.
Everybody said I was crazy.
I'd just like to say that we've proved them wrong.
I've had a great time, and it's thanks to you.
Outside is American Week.
This is my personal contribution to that festivity.
A band that are doyens of the Warsaw Pact.
They're John Paul ll's favorite band,
the Krakow Jazz Ensemble!
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.
- Is there something wrong?
- No.
Everything's going to be all right.
I've seen Cosmo.
- Do we have to buy tickets?
- No, they're paid for.
We just have to pick them up at TWA.
- TWA?
- Yeah.
There's nothing on TWA.
We heard that on the radio last night.
We can transfer to another airline.
- Turn the car around.
- What?
Christ, they're setting us up.
Turn the car around.
- Andrej, is Finney in?
- He's in the office.
- Can I borrow your carjust for a minute?
- Sure. Give him the keys.
- Kate.
- Cosmo.
Where's the car, Kate?
Jesus Christ.
Andrej!
Mr. Cosmo's leaving town, Brendan.
Things haven't worked out here,
have they, Mr. Cosmo?
I hate guns.
Give us the gun.
Katie, you need a ride somewhere?
You're lucky I wasn't holding the gun.
I always keep my receipts.
If anything should happen to my friends...
...l'd be really upset.
Have a pleasant flight.
Come on.
Let's go inside.
