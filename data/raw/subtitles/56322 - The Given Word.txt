Look at this clown!
That must be it
What now?
It's too early, let's wait until it opens.
- I have blisters in my feet.
- And my shoulders are in living flesh.
Now you will learn, i told you to put a cushion there.
It wasn't right. When I made the promise,
I didn't say anything about a cushion.
So, you could have put, the saint
wouldn't say anything.
No, with this stuff about miracles,
we need to be honest.
If we deceive the saint, the other time
the saint will look at us and say:
"So, you're that who deceived me?"
"So go make your promises to the devil!"
What are you searching for?
Anything written, so I can know
if this is the church of Saint Barbara.
Of course it is, don't you remember
what the priest said?
Small church, in front a  wide and fine stair.
If only we could ask someone.
Listen Zé, since the church is closed,
we could look for a place to sleep.
A bed now would be a greater good.
And the cross?
Leave it here, tomorrow morning...
-It could be stealed.
And then i'd have to make another and
came with it in my back.
But you already paid the promise.
You brought the cross.
Here is the church of Saint Barbara,
this is it. Now, let's go home.
But where we're standing is not the church,
the church is in the inside.
Oh shit, the door is closed, Saint Barbara
must know this.
I could talk to her and explain the situation.
Then, talk.
- I can't, i can't.
- Why not?
I said i'd carry the cross to the church,
so I have to do it.
And because of that i have to sleep
here on the floor.
You came because you wanted.
When i made the promise i didn't tell
anything about you.
Only about the cross.
Now you say this, you should've said
before.
I didn't remember, and you didn't
complain either.
I'm your wife, I have to go where you go.
Let's stay down there until the door opens.
Piss off.
Come here women.
When i call, you come here fast,
don't keep talking with the men.
- Hello Handsome, my dress is new. For you.
- You brought what i ask?
-Let's talk about this at home.
- No way, let's solve this right here.
- Leave me alone.
- Come on, let's cut the crap.
Give me the money.
- The night wasn't any good.
- Just this????
Yes.
The brothel was vacant.
Asshole, i needed that money.
I own two months of rent, and the owner
is looking strange at me.
That's your problem, i have a lot to think already.
- I know, I know what you think.
- I think that in the last 3 months, you're earning shit.
- The other girl is earning the double.
- How did you know?
She asked me if I was in need of money.
Handsome! You didn't accept money of that
bitch, did you?
What if I did? I have to live to.
And what I give isn't enough?
You understand. I have my needs, and it's fair that
I live thinking about them.
I haven't give you anything you ask me?
And if you want, I give more.
Don't think that I fear losing you.
But I like to see you with a nice suit.
With a lot of money. I'm proud, you know.
So, in the next time, don't hide the
money in your breasts.
Go home, Marli.
You won't come with me?
Go ahead and I'll go there later.
What you'll do in the streets at this time?
Go Marli.
- I'll be waiting you.
- Go now.
- It's yours?
- Yes.
- Delivery?
- No, promise.
- Haha, that's strange.
- I don't think so.
Sorry, i didn't want to be rude.
I'm a devotee too. Once i made
a promise to Saint Anthony.
- Marriage?
- No, she was married.
And you got what you asked?
Yes, I did, her husband spent a
whole week traveling.
- And you paid your promise?
- No, so I would do any harm to the saint.
You understand. Saint Anthony would feel bad
if he knew that he made the asshole go on a travel.
- What is it?
- Nothing, i was just looking.
This bed doesn't look very comfortable.
And you deserve a better thing.
Say that to him, my husband.
Do you know what time is it?
4:05.
- Do you know what time the church opens?
- It's not my business.
Six o' clock it must be a mass.
Today it's Saint Barbara's day.
Six o' clock! And I have to
wait two more hours on this hard floor.
The door of the sacristy must be open.
The priest wake up early.
- But at 4 AM?
- Well, he have to prepare himself to the mass.
Why don't you take a look?
Rosa, take care of the cross...
You can go calm, i'll help taking care of the cross.
Both of them.
Yes, but one he carries on his back.
And the other one have to follow him.
And you're not a woman to walk with any men.
You're a cross that anyone carries with pleasure.
Don't do that, mister. I just want to sleep.
I'd give my life for a bed. White sheets,
and a bowl with hot water to put my feet on.
I could find a hotel near. Without second intentions,
just so you can rest.
- I don't want any trouble.
- There is no danger, everyone knows me.
- Everyone respects the Handsome.
- Handsome?
Just a nickname.
The hotel has a bathroom. For a tired person
a hot bath and a spring mattress.
There is a spring mattress?
- I never slept on a spring mattress.
- It's very good.
It closed, there is no one in there.
And I have to stay on this hard floor.
Patience Rosa. So you will receive a
gift.
From who? Saint Barbara?
I didn't made a promise.
Better, tomorrow when you make,
the saint will be in debt with you.
I never saw a saint paying a debt.
You must have more faith.
What if Saint Barbara is in the process of
paying this debt?
And who knows if i'm the one who's going
to pay.
You?
Yes, because in 5 minutes I can
find a good hotel with a spring mattress.
Thanks, but I can't.
I have to wait until the church opens.
If I knew that no one would steal the cross.
You shouldn't leave it here.
- This place have a lot of thieves.
That's what I think, I won't get
out of here.
And besides, the hotel isn't included
in the promise.
And your wife? She's in the promise?
Rosa? No!
So, if you want, I can take your wife.
At least, she can rest while she
waits for you.
Do you want that Rosa? You want to
wait for me at the hotel?
It's the ABC Hotel?
- What are you talkin...
- I'm sorry, i've always heard about...
- Trust me!
- It's far from here?
No! It's up the street.
Ideal Hotel.
I'll go with her and introduce her to the janitor,
then, I'll come back and tell you the number of the room.
Well, it would be a great favor.
Ze, I think it's best for me to stay with you.
Don't be shy, so you don't need to stay
on this hard floor.
Saint Barbara! It's going to rain!
Zé
Ok. Here's the money.
I walked 7 leagues, and I have to walk all this way?
In kilometers, how much is this?
I don't know, but I know that I cursed 7 times
the day that i stealed cashew with him.
So, this is how it happened, huh?
- Do you think he will find his way?
- Of course he is.
This streets are complicated.
We make a lot of wrong decisions in our lives.
I thought that because he had a farm...
He would give me all that I wanted in my life.
A man, and a house.
When were very honest, we do a lot of bad things.
So, he has a farm.
Now it's just a little place. He divided it with
the poors.
- What an asshole!
- It was part of the promise.
- What they will think?
- Nothing, I will take you to the room and that's it.
-Give me a room, with a view to the sea.
- Payment in advance.
I'll pay.
Listen, what's that?
I don't know, maybe he was with
the procession.
But Saint Barbara's procession
hasn't started yet.
And have you ever seen someone
carrying a cross in a procession?
- It's day already.
- Yes, it is.
What are you doing?
I'm talking to this man.
I'm waiting for you to help
me with the mass.
Priest! I'd like to talk to you.
Now it's the time of the mass.
I'll talk to you later.
But I come from a long way.
- What do you want?
- I walked 7 leagues.
- Just to talk with me?
- No, to bring this cross.
- And how did you brought it? In a truck?
- No, in my back.
Let me see your shoulder.
- Promise?
- Yes, for Saint Barbara.
I was waiting for the church to open.
You must've received a great blessing.
Thanks to Saint Barbara,death hasn't
taken my best friend.
Even so, don't you think that your promise
it's a little exagerated and pretentious?
Not at all. A promise is a promise. If we
buy something, we have to pay.
When Nicolau got sick, you don't have
any idea of how sad I got.
- So, you made the promise because of this Nicolau?
- Yes, Nicolau got hurt for a tree who fell on a storm.
- It fell on him?
- Just a branch. On his head.
When he got home, he was bleeding a lot.
My wife and I treated him. But the bleeding
couldn't be stopped.
A hemorragy. Come with me.
Let's go, we're late.
So, it was an hemorragy?
It just stopped when i got cow shit
and put in the wound.
- But my son, you can't do that.
- The doctor said that when he arrived.
He told to get that shit out of there,
otherwise, Nicolau would die.
Without a doubt.
So i removed, and the hemorragy started
again, like a waterfall.
And the doctor put cotton, but wasn't
doing any good.
The blood couldn't be stopped.
So, he said to me:
"Go and take more cow shit,
otherwise he will die"
- And the hemorragy stopped?
- Yes, it is a great medicine.
- You didn't knew?
- I'm not interested in this kind of medicine.
Well, the hemorragy stopped, but Nicolau
got a fever.
In the next day, something happened.
I left my house alone, without Nicolau.
Everyone found it strange. Because everywhere
I go, Nicolau is with me.
- If I was in the mass, he was outside waiting.
- Outside?
Why? He isn't catholic?
He does have a good soul, but that's not
the reason.
It's because the priest don't allow.
Just because Nicolau it's a donkey.
A donkey? So this Nicolau is a donkey?
And the promise was for him?
Yes, when I saw that the prayers wasn't
helping.
Prayers? What prayers?
Forgive me, but i tried everything.
The priest i know, is very good in healing.
Dogs, cats, cows.
He can heal all of them just with a prayer.
- Everyone says that.
- So, this man is a wizard.
- Wizard? But his prayers are meant for good.
- It's not to heal. It's to tempt.
And you fell into temptation.
Yes. But nothing could save Nicolau.
I was losing my hope.
That's when a friend said to me:
"Why don't you go on a house of witchcraft?"
Witchcraft?
Wait a minute.
Witchcraft?
Yes, it is 2 leagues away from my farm.
I know that you don't like this.
Of course. This is a bad thing.
Like macumba.
But poor Nicolau was dying.
I had to try.
So I did go there, and the a woman said to
me that was a thing from the God of Thunder.
And the only way to save Nicolau.
Was making a promise, to the Iñasã.
So, i remembered that she was Saint Barbara.
And then I promise that if Nicolau lives.
I'd carry a cross to her church.
On the day of her party.
A cross heavy as the cross of Christ.
- What? And you promised that to...
- Saint Barbara.
- Iñasã?
- It's the same thing.
No no, it's not the same.
This confusion cames from a long time.
Since the slavery.
The slavers said to his owners that they were
worshipping catholic saints.
But they were worshipping their own gods.
Not only Saint Barbara. Other saints were
victims of this farse.
Go on.
I promised to divide my lands too.
- Divide?
- Yes. With other peasants.
- Equally?
- Yes.
I see. Rest.
- And the donkey?
- Healed faster than you can think. A miracle.
The next day he was walking, neighing.
And the next week, everyone was saying:
"There goes Donkey Ze, with his donkey."
I didn't care, Nicolau neither.
Only both of us knew about the miracle.
Me, him and Saint Barbara.
In the first place. Even though Saint Barbara helped.
This is not a miracle.
Only a grace.
The donkey could've healed without
divine intervention.
How? If he got healed in one day.
And besides, if Saint Barbara was to help,
she wouldn't do this in a witchcraft house.
In my chapel there isn't a Saint Barbara.
But in the witchcraft there is a Iñasã.
But this is not Saint Barbara. Saint Barbara
is a catholic saint.
You invoked a false idol, and promise this
sacrifice to him.
No, it was for Saint Barbara.
I promised to carry the cross to her church.
And in the front of her altar, i will fall on
my kness to thank what she did for me.
Ok. And after you fulfil your promise?
I'll go back to my farm.
In peace with my conscience and
with the saint.
Just this? You don't want
to be seen as a new Christ?
- Me?
- Yes, you.
You carried a cross just like Jesus Christ.
You want to imitate the son of God.
But i didn't want to imitate him.
You said that would carry a cross
as heavy as the one who Christ carried.
And this is a proof that you falling into a
greater temptation.
You want to be like the son of God.
No, father.
So why are you doing this? To save everyone?
No. To save your donkey.
And he's a donkey with a christian name.
But Father, it's wasn't God who created
the donkeys?
But it's not the same thing. The donkeys aren't
here to save his sons. But to help us.
For you, for me, for the humanity.
But Nicolau isn't a simple donkey.
You don't know him. He has the soul of a man.
He can have a soul of an angel.
You're not allowed to enter here.
Let's go. Let's go.
Father, listen.
I promised to take the cross to the altar.
I have to fulfil my promise.
You should've done this promise in a church.
Not in a witchcraft house.
But you can't do that. I walked 7 miles.
The church isn't yours. It's God's church.
You will disrespect my authority?
Between you and Saint Barbara.
I chose Saint Barbara.
Close the door, let everyone enter
through the sacristy.
He can't enter with the cross in that door.
Good morning.
You article about the game sucked.
You need to learn the new rules.
We don't want a good article.
We want an article that sells.
Understood. BUt it's not everyday that
we have a good subject.
Make one.
- Can I go?
- Not yet.
Not yet, I want you to find a devout who carried
a cross around the city.
He came from a farm.
Where is him?
I don't know. Find him.
It must be a crazy guy. But is news.
And this story about the devout?
It's within the new rules?
Who knows.
It depends on you.
- What is it?
- He want me to follow a guy who think that is Jesus Christ.
Good Morning Blondie.
Thanks.
- Good morning my child.
Good morning.
Good Morning Blondie.
I never seen a day like this one.
Today i will salute Iñasã.
Please lend me, 2 $.
You and your verses...
Did you see that guy?
He's crazy. For sure is a crazy guy.
He's wants to do a epic. An Iliad.
One where Troy is the Moon.
And the Trojan Horse it's Saint Jorge's horse.
I prefer the other one.
"The Black Emerald"
Another masterpiece.
Like Castro Alves's pieces.
White and red flags. Iñasã colors.
And you say that don't believe in witchcraft.
- I'm only a salesman.
- We're both are.
That man is still in the church?
Yes, it is. And doesn't look like
he's going away.
But i can't let him in. If I do, this wouldn't
be the house of God. But the house of false idols.
It would be a chaos. The end of religion.
- And he walked 7 leagues with that cross.
- Did you see his shoulder?
It's in living flesh.
Hello! This is for the procession of
Saint Barbara?
And what you're doing? Waiting for
the party?
It's too early, and you're stopping the vehicles
- I can't leave here.
- But you have to. Let's go.
I want to understa...
I want to understand you, and everyone.
But no one here seems to understand me.
- So, what do you want?
- I want to put this cross inside the church.
Then I'll go. I'm very tired.
- It was a promise, a promise he made.
- Promise?
To put a cross inside the church? What's
hard about that? Speak to the priest and do it.
I can't help you, because i don't
speak with that priest.
Who wants? "The Black Emerald"
Father, i'm not saying that you have
to open the door. I'm just saying...
I know, I know. But i told,
I can't do anything. Don't you understand?
I do.
I think you have to take him out of here.
But how? Arresting him?
You decide.
- Ok Father, I'm sorry.
- No problem.
Zé, the church isn't open yet?
It is, but the priest doesn't let
me enter with the cross.
- Why?
- I don't know, Rosa.
It looks like they're seeing all wrong.
Heaven in hell, God in the place of the Devil.
I agree. Sometimes we see that we're
someone else. It's horrible.
But this isn't possible Rosa.
I was always faithful to God.
It looks like a punishment.
Punishment? Why? Just because I made
the promise for Iñasã?
If Saint Barbara didn't like that, she
woudn't have healed the donkey.
- Zé, forget Saint Barbara, think about us.
- Us?
Think about me, your wife.
What do you want? Are you tired yet?
- Zé, let's go home.
- I can't I wouldn't be in peace with myself.
- You're too much of a believer.
- You say that because you don't about what can happen.
More than it did happen?
There he is.
Good Morning, friend. Congratulations, you're a hero.
7 leagues carrying this cross.
Heavy, isn't? And in a few hours everyone
will now about that.
- What is the weight of this cross?
- I don't know, I didn't weigh it.
Even though, it's a record.
It's a proof of physical resistance
and dedication.
But how this started?
The donkey got sick, so he the promise to carry
the cross, and share his land with the peasants.
Donkey? What donkey?
- Why? You also think that he isn't worth of that?
- Not at all.
Fabulous. Share his lands.
Do you want an agrarian reform?
Agrarian reform? What is that?
Is what you did with your farm!
Wants an agrarian reform.
What if the government took all the abandoned lands,
and share with the peasants?
It would be a very good thing.
It's against the exploration of the men
by the men.
You're from a political organization?
Once upon a time, they want to make me
city councillor.
- But this time, mister...
- Donkey Zé, at your service.
Donkey Zé, you will be elected with
donkey and everything.
Imagine you walking through the city.
In a truck, everyone applauding you.
Mister, are you crazy?
This is not going to happen.
Yes, because my newspaper will do it.
And you receive a little amount of money.
Mister, you misunderstood me.
Nobody understand me.
I couldn't convince the priest.
He said that he will not open, and i believe him.
This is great. This gives us the time to
organize everything. Trucks and all.
Mister, i came walking and that is
the way i'll go.
-Don't be an idiot, he just want to help.
- So, he can help saying to the priest to open the door.
I will talk to him.
Hey, could you take a picture of my store?
You know, publicity is good.
- Thank you.
- No problem. Let's make an interview with the priest.
Go in the sacristy door.
I guarantee that now the priest will open
the door. Everyone is afraid of the press.
I'll go to the store and take a cooffee.
Don't you want?
A double.
Coffee.
- Did he suspect of anything?
- Nothing.
He just thinks about the cross and the promise.
- I went home to sleep, but i couldn't.
- Why?
- I kept thinking about you.
- You better not.
- Do you regret?
- Yes.
- Now it's too late.
- It isn't. I can forget one night.
We can forget a lot of nights.
I don't know how he didn't suspect.
Makes me angry, I want to tell just to make him angry.
It isn't a bad idea. He's not a violent man.
Let's sit.
He could leave you here in the city.
And go back to the farm alone.
- That would solve everything.
- Solve what?
- Your life. You have a future.
It's no use, that's my life. And besides,
that's the way he is.
- But he has a donkey.
- Asshole.
I wasn't comparing you with the donkey.
He is a great man, you know.
If he is, why are you so "thirsty", huh?
Listen, do you think that the priest
won't let him enter?
Didn't you hear what he was saying?
He is satan.
Satan. Satan disguised as Jesus Christ.
It's a little harsh to me.
This priest is a rock. But he will give up.
Now, this is our cause too. The newspaper's cause.
Close the door.
My son, i'm from a house of witchcraft.
And i know you made a promise to Iñasã.
I'll take to my house, and you leave the cross there.
No, i want the church.
But this priest won't let you.
Let me help you.
No, isn't the same thing.
What do you want?
- It's you who came to talk to me.
- You make me want to do things that i'm not allowed.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
Journalist, huh?
Yeah. They took my picture. Do you think
that they're going to publish it?
Well, if you were naked. For sure.
With your clothes on, I don't know.
I knew it.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to know why didn't you come home last night.
I was feeling sick, so I went to my hotel.
I'm seeing how sick you are.
Go.
- Want to play a hard man around her, huh?
- I don't have nothing with her.
- You spent the whole night with her.
- Let's go home.
- First, I want to solve this problem
- Let's go home, I said.
Leave me, Handsome. I want to stay here.
I want this peasant to know that
you're mine.
He's mine, did you hear?
I give him everything. Even his clothes.
- Shut up!
- He's mine, did you hear?
He's mine.
