Wake up, come on.
We're in Milan
Get up, Luca, we're here.
At last!
Come on, Mamma.
Are you tired?
Rocco, the basket.
Ma, got everything?
- You tired? - You're
sure you have everything?
- Where's Vincenzo?
- l don't know.
- Why isn't he here yet?
- Maybe he's outside.
Why isn't Vincenzo here?
- Why isn't Vincenzo here?
- l can't see, you look.
Here!
Ma, want me to look for him?
- Don't get lost.
- Sure!
There's nobody here.
How beautiful!
- Ciro, look how nice!
- Big, isn't it?
What a city!
Rocco, look at those
shops, the lights.
lt's like daylight.
Listen!
What stop is near
this address?
- Last stop.
- Last stop?
Last stop, end of the line.
At Lambrate.
- What then?
- Get off at Lambrate.
- My son.
- Your son?
- The oldest...
- Oh, the oldest.
We're going to see him.
Let's toast the fiancés!
Best wishes! All the best!
One always ends up drinking
too much at these parties.
Here we are!
Thank you, thanks.
They decided on their own.
Parents don't count anymore.
We had to start sometime.
Besides, l don't feel
like going back down there.
l want to raise my family up here.
Why don't you get married too?
Me? Only my sister's that dumb.
He's worried about supporting us.
But we'll manage on our own.
- That's right.
- Right, Vincenzo?
Thanks.
- We're not looking for anything.
- Oh, Lord! Please...
This is Aldo.
l'm going to the movies.
- Have fun!
- Bye!
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye. Have fun.
Thank you.
Always the movies!
He lives on bread and movies.
lt's a fixation with him!
Sunday l went along too..
..and immediately fell asleep.
Hello.
Do the Giannellis live here?
l'm Mrs. Parondi.
Vincenzo,
come and see who's here.
- Come in, come in.
- Thank you.
Mamma!
Oh, my son.
Luca, how are you?
Rosaria, dear Rosaria.
Your family?
Oh, God bless you!
This is Rosaria, everybody.
They're your brothers?
- This is Luca.
- Hello.
Simone. She's my fiancé.
- Good.
- Rocco..
..and Ciro.
- Hello.
Leave everything here
and come inside.
Come on.
Come inside.
lt's her, Vincenzo's mother!
What a long trip.
Offer her some wine.
Come on, boys!
Offer them some wine,
they must be freezing.
Handsome boys, huh?
The picture of their mother.
Ginetta, pass the cookies around.
Really handsome boys.
Tired, huh?
lt's true, they're very similar.
They're dead tired.
Such a long trip!
- What a nice surprise!
- What's in there?
What misfortune
came upon us, my dear son!
What is this?
Don't you wear mourning
for your father?
No,..
..it's just that...
She's Ginetta. l wrote you
about our engagement.
You arrived
just in time to bless us.
Marriage?
You're so rich that you
can marry? Especially now..
..with your whole family
depending on you?
lf only you'd written..
..and let me know!
- We did write!
Yes, but that was
when Papa died.
l answered: ''First l have
to find them a job''.
lt's not that easy here in Milan.
- Have a seat.
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- Tell us about yourselves.
- Let's hear.
Make yourself at home.
- He's shy.
- Probably tired.
- Not really.
- No? Naturally, he's young.
Were you cold?
- No.
- Some candy?
And what have you got there?
Oranges.
Amelia!
Oranges from our hometown.
- Would you like one?
- Thank you.
Just smell!
Thank you.
Listen, Rosaria, l thought
you came for their engagement.
And that Vincenzo said nothing
because he wanted to surprise us.
My heart's too heavy
to think about parties.
And now what?
You came here straight..
..from the station?
- Yes.
So where
are you gonna sleep tonight?
My son won't leave us
in the street.
He'll take care of us.
Listen here, Rosaria.
l can understand your being
worried about your boys,..
..but what about my girl, huh?!
She arrives just like that,
and ruins everything!
- Mamma, what are you saying?
- Mamma's right.
- You don't understand.
- l'm nobody's fool.
- There's no need to shout!
- Mamma's right!
Let's get out of this house!
Rocco! Simone!
- Mamma, no!
- You're all crazy!
- Come to your mother. - l'm not
crazy. l've understood, all right.
They want to keep you
from helping your mother.
They've no respect
for your dead father! Heathens!
How dare you!
- Let's get out!
- No, no.
Quiet, you, you're one of them!
Let's, boys, hurry up!
God will punish you,
for He judges everyone.
No, wait. They didn't mean
to offend you.
- Move it.
- Leave me, leave me!
- You keep quiet, jerk!
- Think l'm afraid, do you?
Leave my house!
Hear that? What are you
waiting for? Come on!
Get out!
Armando!
- Armando!
- Who is it?
lt's Vincenzo.
Let me in.
What's wrong?
How come so late?
l'll explain later.
Hurry up! lt's cold!
So why are you here
at this hour?
To sleep, if possible.
lt's almost day already.
Let's hear, boy,
what've you done?
l can explain everything.
Down!
Come on in.
You're afraid of the dogs?
Here there's wood, a stove,
all the comforts!
So explain.
My whole family arrived
unexpectedly, like an earthquake..
..And then argued
with my future in-laws.
l had to give up my room,
my fiancé and everything.
For you, a room and a fiancé
are the same thing?
- lt's no joke.
- No.
How can l support
my whole family?
Where'll they stay?
l managed something for tonight,..
..but tomorrow?
Good God!
What's the problem?
Milan's full of empty houses.
Apartment buildings are
shooting up like mushrooms.
What about the rent?
Listen to me, do what all
you Southerners do.
- Know what l mean?
- Not exactly.
You rent a public housing
apartment and..
..if you can, you pay.
but after a few months
you stop paying.
- How is that?
- Wait!
A month later they evict you.
- How can l....
- Wait!
Then you join
the other evictees where you pay..
..almost nothing and there's
central heating, electricity, etc.
Milan's City Hall
leaves no one on the street.
Couldn't we go straight there?
No, you have to be evicted.
- Ah, right! - That's
the secret, understand?
- Good evening.
- Don't be such a knucklehead!
Porter!
Porter!
Huh?
l'm Mrs. Parondi, open up!
l'm coming! Hold on!
- What's the big rush?!
- ls this the place?
- There.
- l'm Rosaria Parondi.
Yes, Parondi, it's over there.
Downstairs, lower level.
Get a load of them.
Good morning, Signora Maria.
Did you see those dreadful people?
Zulus!
- Where are they from?
- Lucania.
Lucania? Odd name! Where's that?
Never heard of it.
Down South.
Ahh!
The land of do-nothings!
Wake up!
Ciro.
lt's snowing.
Rocco!
There's work for everybody.
Simone! lt's snowing.
What happened?
Nothing.
Today there's work for us.
The snow.
lt's sticking to the ground!
Luca, look, it's snowing.
- The snow!
- Get up.
Move along or we'll be too late.
The Milanese don't like
their streets with snow.
Hey, sleepyhead, get up!
Look at the snow!
Simone, darling, get up.
lt's snowing!
How wonderful!
There should be work
for everybody.
Look, the others are almost ready!
Get up, get up!
- Get a move on, Rocco.
- We're coming.
Simone!
Rocco, you've been sick.
- Wear one of my sweaters.
- But it's a woman's.
Let them tease away. Listen
to your mother. Put it on.
l'll get some breakfast.
Simone!
Come on, Simone,
we're working today.
- Luca! - Luca,
you'll make us late. Quit it!
- Careful not to fall.
- Off you go!
- Hurry, boys!
- Move it, Ciro! Simone!
- The coffee's almost ready.
- Here l am.
Drink the eggs,
they're fresh and healthy!
The coffee's boiling hot.
Put in lots of bread.
Fix some for your brother too.
Oh, thank God,
there's work here for everybody!
The Lord is merciful.
He sent us the snow.
- You wearing my sweater?
- Yes.
Simone, dear, hurry. Come on!
- Poor baby, he has to go to work.
- lt's freezing. You even left..
..the window open.
l don't get hot flashes.
Come on, the city's waiting
for us, lazybones!
That guy will never change.
Finish your coffee.
l'll get lunch ready.
Luca, my satchel!
- Yes, Mamma.
- No, l'll get it.
- Luca, my satchel!
- lt's here, under the bed.
- l'll get it for you.
- Hurry up!
Here are your coats.
Rocco, cover up.
Don't take chances,..
..you've been sick.
lf you had a chill...
Here, everything's ready.
Come on, hurry!
Hey, lazybones,
l'll help you with your coat.
Cover up, you loafer, you.
God bless this city!
You happy now?!
Rocco, my angel.
- This coffee's boiling hot.
- Come on, Ciro.
Hurry! lt's stopped snowing.
There's enough for a day's work.
Don't forget your hats.
Hurry it up!
Dear God, you can't be late!
Hurry, Mamma's kicking us out.
- Be quick!
- Coming, Mamma.
Move, l'm freezing here.
- Give me a kiss.
- Ciao.
Ciao, Rocco, God be with you.
You be careful, Ciro.
Go on, Vincenzo!
Good work!
By all the Saints, if you
don't come back with money..
..you're no longer sons
of Rosaria Parondi!
- Ciao, Mamma.
- Good luck!
- Simone!
- Yes?
- Are you coming too?
- Where?
- To the delegation.
- Where's that?
l don't know.
Simone, Rocco, hurry!
- Ciao.
- You see him?
- He's gone now.
- How are you?
- You haven't been around.
- l can explain everything.
- Ciao, Ginetta.
- Ciao.
Let's go where we can talk.
l can't come to your house anymore..
..and you're always chaperoned....
Our families are against us.
- What chance do we have?
- l keep hoping.
- You're a born optimist.
- Ciao, Ginetta.
- Ciao.
- We'll manage.
We've got a place now.
And Mamma says one must take....
- Ciao!
..a woman without asking,..
..anyone's permission.
- One what?!
What's wrong?
One takes her, like one
takes a woman, without asking.
With me you have to ask
every time!
- l'll ask.
- Ciao.
You whore!
Miserable bitch!
Shut up! l'm going!
- What's going on?
- Quiet!
lt's my father.
We don't get along.
Who are you?
You live here?
Wish l could,
but they don't want me. Hear that?
Why not?
Oh, the same old stupid story:
..you know, a girl's honor, etc.
They think it's important.
What's a poor girl to do?
Can you imagine if all girls like me
suddenly disappeared? Just think....
Yeah....
There'd only be us men left.
- To do what?
- Quiet!
- Hear that?
- What'll you do?
Go away. What else?
Wait.
Come inside.
Maybe my mother..
..has something warm
for you to wear..
You're sweet.
l'm what?
You're sweet.
Let's go.
- How far?
- Right there.
Come in.
- That's you, Vincenzo?
- Yes, Ma.
Were they shouting at you?
No, not me,..
..at this poor girl here
who's got a problem.
Do you have something
she can cover up with?
- A girl?
- Yes, Ma.
- Where is she?
- Here, look.
- Sorry, if l'm disturbing you.
- Close the door, it's freezing.
Come in. l don't know
what l can give her.
There's your father's old coat.
Whatever, but hurry,
she's shivering.
Let's see.
Evening.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Your brothers, huh?
Yes, we're all brothers.
lt's much colder down here.
You're Milanese?
Nearby. From Cremona,
to be exact,..
..like the pickled fruit!
Southerners, huh?
You work here?
Today we shoveled snow.
Good for you!
He brought us.
We've been here a month.
Work's hard to find.
That's why we shoveled snow
today. Sit down.
Big boys like you find work
immediately, if that's..
..what you want.
Your family?
Yeah, l'm in the middle.
So you're in the middle.
And that's you?
- This one is....
- He's Rocco.
- Which one is Rocco?
- lt's him. - Yes, it's him.
And that's the other one.
And who's the boxer here?
Vincenzo.
Who's Vincenzo?
But he's got no feel for it.
Why not?
lt's a shame. l know a champion.
He was just a nobody.
And now he's rich,
made piles of money!
l swear he drives a car
as long as a bus.
Better than shoveling snow!
You see!
He's against our trying out.
- What's there to lose?
- No?
You're right.
lf you're so convinced,
then do it!
You don't need his permission.
You heard what she said.
Baloney! My great career's
already come to an end.
lf you're lucky,
they pay your lunch.
Because you're not a champ.
You don't become one overnight.
Maybe Simone and Rocco just might.
They're stronger than you.
They'll still end up
with cauliflower ears.
The guy capable of knocking
Simone out hasn't even been born yet.
Mamma's right, Simone's stronger.
l almost forgot,
here, put this on.
l couldn't find anything better.
Thank you.
l'll bring it back tomorrow.
Wait, it's my friend,..
..the Sergeant who lives
in this building.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
- Could you accompany her?
- Yes.
She had a bad fight
with her father.
- You can change in the bathroom.
- Thanks.
She's all we needed!
Come here,
and close that door!
What's got into you?
Bringing her here!
You know her?
She could even be a whore.
- She's beautiful.
- Beautiful?
She had goose pimples,
the weakling.
Learn how to look at women.
She had goose pimples
because she was cold.
No, she's anaemic,
she's got Northern skin.
She's gone.
And my coat?
She went out the window.
Gone? Run off?
A thief!
Her dress.
You're kidding...
l'm sorry,
l bothered you for nothing.
That's all right,
don't worry about it.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Disappointed?
l don't care.
You worry about yourself.
And clean those lentils.
You see, Ginetta is not
the only girl in the world.
Time to eat, boys.
The soup's ready. Come on!
Rocco, come and eat.
#Maria Donata,
what beautiful flower is this!#.
#Let me give it a kiss.#
#Oh, it's your mouth,
your nose.#
#My love's a rose, a rose.#
Turn round.
Your right!
Hold it!
Lift that right!
- Merli, hold on, l'll come back.
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?
- Just looking.
Sorry, they're my brothers.
lt wasn't my idea.
Colli, have them change!
Parondi,
get your ass back here.
You heard him?
Move it!
Well?
What are you doing?
Need an invitation?
- Wait a minute, you.
- You calling me?
Yeah, you with that cigarette.
Put some trunks on.
Hurry it up!
These hicks...
They wanna box and smoke too.
Get changed.
- Where are you from?
- Lucania.
- Where's that?
- Oh, it's a long way from here.
- You came up here to box?
- Why not?
- lt's tough!
- We can try.
Quiet!
Vincenzo!
Vincenzo!
Vincenzo!
- Vincenzo, where are you?
- l'm up here.
- They've come to evict us!
- At last!
Ma doesn't know what to do.
You coming?
l can't.
Tell Mamma the City Hall
will give us a place now.
She needn't worry.
Do like l said, go on!
Jab, again!
Jab! Again!
Jab! Jab! Jab!
Where you going? Come here!
Jab! Jab!
Come here! Jab! Jab!
Jab! Jab!
Ciao, Duilio, how's it going?
Fine, fine. He's new?
3 months.
He's slow, but solid.
- Go take your shower.
- Okay.
Hey!
Not bad.
Good horse teeth, but stained.
Cut out the cigarettes,
if you wanna box.
No offense, but if he stays
here, he'll get nowhere.
Got a minute?
Don't start taking
my best recruits now.
You'll see,
you'll be going with him.
''Cerri's Gym'',
where the champs work out.
Let's hope they release me.
But if they don't,..
..l'll go anyway.
They think l got the goods.
They never wanted Vincenzo.
What about you?
l guess
l don't have the goods.
Wait up,
l'm gonna shower too.
Age?
Twenty one.
Military service?
l'm 4-F,
because of an accident.
We'll get round that.
You willing to work?
To work?
ln a gym. To get..
..into shape.
We're forming a stable
of newcomers.
You're not that young,..
..but we'll see.
Coke!
Beer! ''Chinotto''!
Throw him out!
Go! Scram!
A light heavyweight
three-round match. Between..
..Parondi, representing Milan,..
..sponsored by the Aurora Club....
- l'm leaving!
- Sit down!
- Let me go!
- Parondi, traitor!
- They're razzing me.
- Just worry about Simone.
They're Ginetta's brothers.
....and Vitolo,
representing Virtus Club, Lucania.
Go, Vitolo,
teach him a lesson!
Quiet.
The Parondis are all traitors!
Ferri, from Genoa.
Seconds out.
First Round.
Parondi!
Parondi!
Go, Simone, go!
- Bluff!
- Cut it out!
Phoney!
By a knockout..
..in the first round,
the winner is Simone Parondi.
May l?
Hello, everybody!
Good, very good!
What's this?
Nothing.
Anyway... he didn't go the limit.
lsn't he modest? ''Didn't go the limit''!
You're a champ!
Purple, the color
of champions and showgirls.
l'll train him myself.
l know what he needs.
We'll eat out tonight
to celebrate.
l'll be waiting in my car.
Right?
- Sure, thanks.
- Ciao.
Good evening.
Simone!
- There's a fight going on outside!
- A fight?
- Yeah! - But where?
- Come on! Quick!
Trai-tor! Trai-tor!
Cowards!
Cowards!
Come away.
Move!
- Move!
- Vincenzo!
- Let me go!
- Come away!
Alfredo, wait!
We have a score to settle.
l've already settled everything.
l'll be the one to settle it.
- Wait! l'll handle this!
- Shut up, and go home!
- Move!
- Ginetta!
l said go home!
- Leave me alone!
- Ciro!
Trai-tor! Trai-tor!
Remember me?
Of course.
Well?
- You coming?
- l'm coming.
So you decided to box.
A good idea. Yeah!
lt's a nice profession.
Taste good?
lf l'm not mistaken, you box..
..the way l put out.
For money.
No, l box with feeling.
With feeling?
Yeah, well,
l work with feeling too!
And your brother?
Which one?
The oldest. The one
who called the police.
What a day!
First it snowed, then my father,..
..then running away....
l never could stand the police.
Even as a kid.
You can imagine now!
l'm tired.
l'll sleep and you'll disappear.
- No.
- Yes, you will.
Because l'm telling you to.
l like sleeping alone.
That's why l left home.
When l was little,
my father..
..took sick,
and was hospitalized,..
..and we ended up
staying with an uncle.
After the war,
houses were hard to find.
l remember we were
all together,..
..crammed in one room.
Like your house.
On summer mornings,
once school let out,..
..we'd play in the courtyard.
l was big for my age..
..and didn't like kids' games.
So l'd just watch.
The dentist from the ground floor..
..beckoned to me.
After that,
l started going there nights.
A great improvement.
Now we were only two in a bed.
- How old were you?
- 1 3.
lt's not true, it's not true
about the dentist.
l was happy as a child.
The trouble started later on.
Please, l'm so tired.
l already told you, go!
What is it?
Again?
l'm over here!
Coming!
- Well?
- Here...
These are the notices
for night school.
They were free,..
..but you need an elementary
school certificate.
l have one.
- Here!
- What's that?
Stop wasting your money!
Simone gave it to me.
Ah, Simone!
Did he go to work?
He was sleeping when l left.
He never works mornings.
Yeah, and who knows
what he works at?
Something good! He gave
Mamma 2,000 liras yesterday.
And what're you doing?
l'm a delivery boy for the grocer
near our house.
As soon as l turn twenty,
l'll show you all!
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Are you sure you know
how to read?
Everything's such a mess
since you've been here.
- lt's not this one.
- lt is. Look!
- No.
- That's not true,..
..lt's always been a mess.
- No, it hasn't.
Give me the receipts,
and l'll check.
- They're all scrambled up.
- Now, let's see.
The boss said
she's got a headache.
She probably didn't sleep
last night, poor thing.
Can't you remember his name?
Try, at least.
He's only been here a month.
A year wouldn't be enough
time, huh, Rocco?
Our ''Sleeping Beauty''!
lda, give him a kiss,
that might wake him.
My boyfriend would kill me.
l'll do it.
Oooh, a customer!
- Hello? Signora Ubaldi?
- Who's he?
My brother.
Tell him to come round
the back or clear off.
The boss doesn't want
relatives visiting in the shop.
- Good morning, you girls.
- Good morning.
Just what l need!
You never said
it was such a nice place.
You hang your clothes
there, and....
Can't you read?
You come in, undress..
..and go out brand new.
Exactly what l wanted!
How fast can you do it?
lt's expensive.
So who cares?!
What's going on?
They said they'd make me
over in 5 minutes.
- You want proof?
- Yes.
- ln the booth. Giannini,
take care of him. - Thanks.
- Rocco, you're still here?
- lt's his brother.
Show her the package.
There's no receipt.
lt belongs to your relative...
what's-her-name....
lt's Signora Brighetti!
Here are my trousers.
And wait, here's my shirt.
- Ma'am!
- Yes?
Can we do this shirt?
No, not the shirt.
- lt's too frayed.
- What a shame...
- Then what'll l do?
- l can't.
Let me see what we can do here.
Rocco, hurry!
You'll be late.
Come here.
We gotta talk.
The rest was just for fun.
Pardon us, my friend.
Rocco! l got something
important going.
Did you get paid yet?
- Tonight.
- l need the money now.
Tell them at the gym.
l'll be gone 2 days.
Rocco,
don't lend him anything.
l thought you liked me.
l'm protecting Rocco,
he should be wary of you.
- You'll do it?
- Sure.
What should l give him?
Half a month's wages?
- Yes, Signora.
- After taxes, that is.
- Of course.
- Fine.
- Does Mamma know?
- She knows.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Rocco, come here.
Your trousers
are almost ready.
May l have the jacket?
Just a couple of minutes.
- Ah... here.
- Thanks.
Sign this.
The trousers!
- That was fast.
- l told you so.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
Here's the coffee
and aspirin you ordered.
l feel like l'm brand new.
Thanks.
Drop in again, sir. Goodbye.
- Here l am.
- Look at him, will you!
You could use a new shirt.
Like those.
They're Dr. Fossati's shirts!
They'd look better
on someone like you.
But that's life:
luxuries always come too late.
Your brother's 5,000 liras.
You owe me 700.
Don't have it.
Rocco will pay you.
Ma'am, good day
and many thanks.
- Good day!
- See you soon!
Well?
No, please... my head!
Go on! Faster!
Close the door, boy.
Did you hear me?
What do you want?
Well?
My brother, Simone, is sick.
He won't be coming.
Great!
Sick? They saw him in town.
l wouldn't know about that.
There's a draft, come in!
You know nothing,
but l'm on to him.
You're his brother?
Then listen.
lnstead of helping him,
l should have hung him.
That's it!
That's enough, all of you...
Clear out!
l shouldn't have
brought him here.
l admit it: my mistake.
Never again!
That's it for today.
- So you're Simone's
brother, huh? - Yes.
Your brother's got a nice
build, a good punch..
..but he's slow. He should
work out more than the others.
My office.
They trained with me,
fine boxers.
Thanks to me.
Close the door.
Want to help
before it's too late?
Come to the gym together,
you and him.
- Me?
- Yeah.
Stay with him, never let him
out of your sight.
- Your name?
- Rocco.
Like Rocco Mazzola.
From Lucania, like you!
You're a good kid.
lt won't cost you anything,
just look after your brother.
And stop him from hanging out
with certain people.
Boxing's a serious thing..
.. you've gotta lead
a clean life. Like them.
Good morals are the first
requisite of an athlete.
Meaning that... women,
cigarettes, drinking..
..and many other things
are taboo.
Absolutely taboo.
Look at that motor-boat.
Let's go, come on!
- 'Bye, now.
- Happy Easter.
What's that?
A hotel,
first class, sweetie!
- Can we see it?
- Why not?
lt's called
''The Great Britain''.
English tourists used
to crowd here to Bellagio.
People are here now
because it's Easter.
lt's got 200, 250 rooms....
- See you around.
- 'Bye, now.
A garden!
And it's fabulous.
You should see it inside.
l was in there once.
- You were in it?
- lnside! lt's fantastic!
You should see the rooms,
not like our pension.
The place is super, really.
So are the prices.
- Know what they ask? For a room?
- No.
10,000 liras, just for the room.
10 times 30....
300,000 liras a month
just for a room?
That's a lot!
They're crazy.
How's it possible?
Anyway,
very soon we'll come here.
Want to bet?
When l turn professional.
- Got a cigarette?
- What a place! Gee!
- Want one?
- Oh, no, no. l shouldn't.
The boxer!
l'll keep them.
What'll you earn?
Plenty.
But l gotta train hard.
lt'll be a sacrifice.
For you too.
Why for me?
When you're in training,
you can't....
Let's get something straight.
We're not married.
We just go out sometimes.
We may not go out
for another year.
But now we're together.
l needed a change of air.
Without attracting
too much attention.
After each affair,
a nice clean break.
Scram!
You get me?
- Miss!
- Are you talking to me?
You can't stay here.
l'm sorry, but....
ls it reserved?
What's wrong, we got lice?
- l'm sorry.
- That's the limit!
We gotta pay?
l just follow orders.
He follows orders!
Well, l happen to like it here!
Good day, sir!
My regards to the manager!
You want money,
you little twerp?!
- Bye, Rocco!
- Ciao.
- Rocco!
- What is it?
Seen my brother?
He just left.
Didn't you bump into him?
No, we didn't.
Who's there?
Just me.
l'm Rocco's brother.
l have a package here.
l'll come by tomorrow.
l'll leave it with
the janitor.
Leave it in the shop. Come on.
Through there.
The door on the left.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
May l?
- Anybody here?
- Come in.
- Ah. Well, how are you?
- Oh, it's you.
One of the girls said
l could leave this package.
She didn't say you were here.
Just as well.
What is it?
Try to understand...
lt needs washing.
lt's not mine.
lt's one of the shirts
that were there.
l only wore it once.
You said it would look better
on someone like me....
What? Have you gone mad?!
Answer me!
And stop laughing! You come in
here asking favors..
..and then ridicule
our courtesy..
..with your insolence!
- Thief!
- l wasn't really stealing.
That's hard to believe!
You take advantage of people's
kindness and generosity.
l'm so gullible, ready
to believe everyone and everything.
lt's a struggle for
a woman alone,..
..to keep track
of everything.
What do you want?
No, don't...
Why do they suspect you?
l don't know.
The boss keeps watching me.
She's a little crazy.
That's true.
But the girls
keep watching me too.
- Tomorrow let's go to the police
and straighten it out. - Yeah.
Parondi!
Parondi,
you're wanted at the entrance!
They've come to arrest me!
Who's calling our name?
- No, l'll go.
- Yes, you go.
- What's up?
- They want Vincenzo Parondi..
..upstairs.
- Vincenzo?
He's not here.
You know where he is?
What do they want?
l don't know. l'll go.
- Yes.
- Goodnight.
Do you know what they want
with him and at this hour?
- lt's not that late.
- What time is it?
- lt's only 10.
- Oh.
Go back to bed.
Shall l come?
You stay here with Mamma.
- Ciao, Rocco!
- Good night.
What's wrong?
Go to sleep.
What about you?
When'll you finish?
l still have to study.
l'll wait up for Rocco.
All right.
Simone isn't back yet...
Neither is Vincenzo.
Oh, these boys!
Hey, you! Hurry up.
- Am l the one you want?
- You're Vincenzo?
No, he's with Ginetta.
They're engaged,
but Mamma doesn't approve..
..so they meet outside
otherwise she makes a scene.
l don't want your family history.
- Who are you?
- Rocco.
Oh, yeah...
l have to talk to you.
Hop in.
Not here. The other side.
lf l don't practise driving,
l'll never learn.
ls that street one-way?
- l don't drive.
- Oh, great!
Yup, it's one-way.
The whole world's
a one-way street.
- Where we going?
- Where l won't meet anybody.
This is good.
l asked for Vincenzo because
l know him better,..
..but you'll do.
Do you recognize this?
Simone says he bought it,..
..l say he stole it.
And l don't care where.
l've got enough troubles.
l can't take risks.
Do you understand?
Great!
- Why steal...?
- To make me happy.
Seems l'm worth it.
l'm not?
What are you wearing under there?
l was already in bed.
You're nice and warm.
Don't worry, l don't bite.
Tell your brother that
l'm giving back this stuff.
Thank him, but tell him not
to come looking for me.
You understand?
''Nadia's left.
She's gone forever''.
What are you staring at?
l look strange, or something?
No, you're not strange.
You're very considerate.
- Why did he do it?
- Why do you think?
Good night, little boy.
l'm glad you find me considerate.
Sorry l can't drive you back,
it's late.
Stop being so scared.
Now beat it!
Hey!
You're back!
Who'd they want, you or me?
They wanted me, at the shop,
for the keys to the storeroom.
- The keys to the storeroom?
- Yes.
And the theft?
There wasn't one. She found
the pin. lt wasn't stolen.
- She's crazy.
- l told you.
- l'm quitting.
- But it's a good job.
Not any more.
You should find something
better before quitting.
l did.
See this?
lt's my draft card.
lt came this morning.
But with everything going on,
l forgot about it.
- l've been drafted.
- Good luck, then.
You hear that?
lt's his turn now.
Good night.
- Simone?
- What?
l'd like to talk to you.
Coming back from the shop,
l ran into a girl.
The daughter of that family
at Lambrate, remember?
Yeah.
She said she's leaving,
going away.
- When did you see her?
- Just now.
Going where?
She didn't say.
You know her too?
What's she want?
What's with her, anyway?
She's just another girl..
..trying to be a lady.
Who needs her?!
l got better things to do.
From now on,
l don't know who she is.
lf you see her tell her that!
''We finally moved into
the new apartment.''
''Everyone knows us since Simone
won that fight in Genoa.''
''They treat me with respect.
lt would have been a good year..''
''..but Vincenzo got Ginetta
pregnant and had to marry her.''
''Now he's gone, and you're off
doing military service.''
''Simone can't work, because
he has to keep training.''
''Ciro has a new job
at the Alfa Romeo plant..''
''..thanks to his night
school diploma.''
''He's the only one bringing
any money in. And the expenses!''
''lf you have anything left
from your pay, send it.''
''You can't spend it anyhow.
We're all well.''
''l hope you are too. A big hug
from, your loving Mother.''
Hey!
l wasn't wrong, it's you.
What's with that getup?
l'm a soldier.
That's pretty obvious.
Since when?
l've served 1 4 months.
Me too. More or less.
ln this same town.
Buy me a coffee.
l'd like to, but l just sent
money to my mother.
l'll buy, you chump!
Better yet, we'll hire
a carriage and ride through town....
l'll take your bag.
....and have coffee
in a decent place.
Driver, put the top down,
we need some air.
- You didn't understand?
- No.
1 3 months and 8 days.
No suspended sentence
because of my record.
Was it bad?
Fairly but bearable.
Time flies
when every day's the same.
Wouldn't seem so but it's true.
Hey, wake up!
Does knowing
an ex-inmate bother you?
lt's not that unusual.
There wasn't only me.
But l'm the first one you've met?
No, some friends in my home town,..
..my own age,
poorer than you could ever imagine.
They were lead to believe
they could farm some land.
But the land was arid, and the work
backbreaking, and it took hours..
..to reach the place. Then one day,
they spoke up, and rebelled.
They were arrested..
..in Matera, in Potenza.
My town was like that.
l understand.
That's why you all came North?
l'd have stayed.
You don't like Milan?
lf only we had the means
to live decently,..
..here where we grew up.
l'm lost in the city.
l was neither born
nor raised in one.
Not only me,
but my brothers and my friends.
Some get used to city life,..
..and seek
the pleasures of city people.
Not me.
l don't think that's right.
l mean,
l want an automobile too.
But after the things
that come first,..
..a steady job, a home,
and eating every day.
Do l make myself clear?
Your opinion of me?
Nothing.
Aren't you curious?
Speak up.
l was wondering...
How old are you?
That's easy,..
..25, so what?
You said:
''Aren't you curious?''....
Nothing else interests you?
l offended you.
Did you?
You keep staring at me...
Forgive me.
But, somehow,
l feel great pity for you.
How nice!
Actually, l'm very tired.
l wasn't exactly on vacation,..
..and what's to come is worse.
Don't say that.
One can live as he likes,..
..if he chooses to.
But you shouldn't be afraid
and you seem to be.
You're really something.
Say no more. Look
at the effect you have on me.
You want me to go?
What a dope!
Take me to the station,..
..but enough talk about me,
it's depressing.
What's your cure?
Have faith and have no fear.
Great faith...
ln what?
l don't know...
in everything.
ln you?
ln me too.
- Can we meet in Milan?
- Yes.
Maybe you can teach me
not to be afraid.
Sure!
Yes.
Rocco.
Mamma's boy Rocco.
Oh, my boy, you're so handsome!
Come on!
l was just
getting your bed ready.
They delivered it yesterday.
Look at him, he's just back
from the service!
Let them see you.
How handsome my boy is!
See, not much furniture,
but we'll get there.
Ah, but Saint Rocco
is always in my bedroom.
You look good.
Oh, but my teeth are troubling me.
You like it here?
Yes, but....
Where's everybody?
l purposely came on Sunday
when everyone's home.
- l even wrote.
- l know but....
l kept saying: Ciro will surely
meet me at the station.
They'll be here at noon.
Don't be upset.
Tell me where to put your bed.
Come on!
l sleep there with Luca.
You three'll sleep here.
Simone, Ciro,
and you, my sweet boy!
You know...
Ciro's been so wonderful,
you can't imagine!
They're at the Baptism
of Vincenzo's baby.
- And you're not going?
- Not me. No.
- Why is that?
- You were arriving.
That's no reason,
l could've joined you.
- Let's go now.
- No, it's too late now.
You're not still angry
with Vincenzo?
No, he always comes
to visit me.
- And Ginetta?
- Not Ginetta.
Not even now
that she's had the baby?
Do you think her folks invite
your brother?
Let me go.
l'd like to see them.
Go ahead.
Thanks.
- Ciao, Mamma.
- Ciao.
- Ciao, Luca. Ciao, Vincenzo.
- So, you're back!
Ciao, Ginetta.
He's so handsome!
- We named him Antonio.
- Antonio, like Papà.
- May l hold him?
- Why not?
Antonio.
What a lovely baby! Antonio!
Move!
Get the lead outta your legs!
Pure lead!
Don't make me use gloves
just before the fight.
l know what's best.
l can't get him to understand
what he's up against.
- Someone who hits hard.
- l told him.
- That's what you always say.
- This time it's true.
A guy's got a chance
if he's fast. But you're not.
Well, then it's your fault.
l never sparred
with anybody fast.
Sure, sure!
l'll find the right guy.
Put some gloves on.
Come on!
- Me?
- Yes.
- Very funny.
- Let him try.
Yeah,
try staying on his feet tomorrow!
Put some gloves on!
Jab! Left! Left!
Look,
l'm up against clowns!
Sacks of potatoes,
that's all they are!
We'll be a laughingstock tomorrow.
Shitheads!
What a brainless bunch.
l'm through!
l've had it!
l want real boxers,
who care!
You're clodhoppers!
These Milanese are right.
Dirt-pushers. l can do without you!
Hey, come take a look, come on.
- Cerri!
- What's up?
- Come and take a look.
- l don't want to see anything....
- Come on!
- ....nothing.
- Come on out, Cerri.
- No, l don't feel like it.
- lt's worth it.
- What's there to see? - A real show.
See that?
Ain't it wonderful?
He woke up.
Great!
Good, work him like that.
Listen to me.
That's it.
l'm coming.
Use your left.
Come on, Simone! Wake up!
- That kid, you know,....
- He's not bad.
He's not bad at all!
He's okay.
Look how he dodges punches.
Go on, get him!
Leave things up to me
before a fight.
l get nervous!
You get up there with Rocco.
Your turn, Dal Piaz!
Time!
He boxes real nice.
Simone, watch it,
or he'll grab your place.
Tomorrow, huh?
Yeah, tomorrow we'll see
if you do like l say....
Well done!
You've made progress, kid!
ln the army,
we'd work out together..
..l even fought a few matches.
- How did you get on?
Two draws and a win,
but it's....
- Ah!
- ....not for me.
- You don't like it?
- No.
l'm going now,
lt's late...
- Have a massage first.
- Okay.
- What's up?
- Nothing.
Clod,
Get back on the farm!
l can't take anymore.
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't give up now, you fool.
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't give up. - l can't take it!
Listen to me. There's only
one thing you can do,..
..use you left,
understand, your left!
- l can't take it.
- Not the right.
- Throw in the towel.
- Don't quit now,..
..you damn fool!
- 5, 6, 7,..
..8.
- The towel!
Breathe deeply.
Damn! lt was a draw up to now.
He loses a round: ''The towel!''.
- l shouldn't have thrown it in.
- After seven rounds,..
..the winner is Webster.
Don't blame me.
What's the use?
l'll blame who l damn please!
My fault anyway!
Who gives a damn about him?!
My reputation, my interests
are at stake here..
..not his!
- lt's all over now.
Great show, your brother!
l found him changed
when l came back from the service.
Stop defending him,
we both know how things went.
As things stand now
you can't say no to me.
You're indebted for the trouble..
..your brother put me through.
Agreed?
- How come your boy lost?
- Eh!
You're mincemeat.
Shut up!
Your attention, please.
Did you hear what they said?
That was nothing.
Cerri threw his usual fit.
He wasn't wrong
but he calmed down.
He even said
he'd try your brother.
Who? Rocco?
lf your brother accepts
he'll have to cool it too.
With the hookers, l mean.
On that score,
he's the world champion.
What about that bloodsucker
who beat you to a pulp?
Don't tell me you don't know?
The whole town knows
about your brother..
..and his great love
they've been seen together.
l checked.
He hangs out
around the Ghisolfa, at night.
With Nadia.
Don't tell me now
that you didn't know?
No, l didn't.
They say she's in love.
Rossi's the one who told me.
Nino, you remember?
Nadia was crazy about him.
Now she turns her back on him
and everybody else.
She's going
to some secretarial school.
A real Saint Agnes.
Stop that!
- Who's paying the bet?
- Pay up. l won.
And one coffee, l'm freezing.
- One coffee!
- Laced with grappa.
So?
So l followed him,..
..he was with a blonde.
- Whereabouts?
- Over by the viaduct.
They all go there,
near where the train passes.
We could be wrong,
maybe it isn't her.
Don't be a chump,
it's her, all right.
Okay. Let's go.
And Camisasca? Riguttini?
They're following them, who are
probably at the sanatorium by now.
l'll get my bike and show you.
How can they make out
in this weather?!
Move it.
Hey, Romeo, over!
- Are they there?
- They're there. Let's go.
lf it's not them, you've had it!
They went down,
by the shack, just now.
You go along the river.
l'll go this way.
And wait for my signal.
- You're going alone?
- Yes.
Hear that? What was it?
lt's nothing, probably a cat.
Don't move.
Don't move!
What's wrong
being with whom l like?
Not with her, she was mine.
l'm not taking that from you.
Understand?
That's all over.
You haven't seen her in 2 years.
Come on, Rocco.
What's going on?
Huh, Simone?
What do you want?
First, Rocco's apologies.
Why?
You coward!
Look,
he lets a woman protect him.
The rat!
Ask my forgiveness!
- Can't you see? He's drunk.
- Ask my forgiveness, l said!
Stop!
- Don't, Simone!
- l'll do what l want.
- No!
- Being cheated on for him!
Take a look at your Nadia!
At how she makes love!
Let him see what you are!
Hold on to him!
He'll watch.
- He has to learn.
- Rocco! Rocco!
No, Simone, don't do it!
Rocco, help me!
- Rocco! Rocco!
- Simone, don't!
- Grab....
- Rocco!
- ....and kiss them if you can.
- No! Rocco!
You only know how to make love
with these.
No! Rocco, help me!
Simone, don't!
Simone!
Rocco!
Rocco!
Say something. Tell me it's....
Rocco, tell me it's....
You learned your lesson!
We'll discuss it at home.
You disgust me.
l dare you to repeat that.
You disgust me.
Simone, that's enough!
You're my brother,
l can't help that!
But that didn't stop you.
lt does now because you're afraid.
l'm not afraid.
Then, come on. Show me.
Simone, you crazy?
Supposing someone shows up?
Scram!
Simone, cut it out!
Come on, get in.
Vincenzo, the doorbell.
- The doorbell.
- Go see who's there.
Go on!
Rocco!
What happened?
- Ginetta, look.
- What happened?
Rocco!
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
- Vincenzo, let me stay here
with you. - Okay.
Let them know at home,..
..otherwise Mamma will worry.
Oh, God! He's fainted!
Ginetta, some water! Hurry!
How could l know
Simone loved you so much?
l knew something
had changed in him....
....in his good nature.
But not that you were the reason.
lt's not true.
Only a man
who's become desperate.
He's vile, cruel. l love you.
Don't you believe me?
Then it's all useless.
l can't believe anything.
lf you keep on
like this, l'll jump.
l'll kill myself!
- Stop!
- No!
- Listen to me.
- Let go.
- l want to die!
- Nadia!
- Listen.
- Leave me alone, l beg you.
You helped me understand..
..my life was loathsome.
l learned to love you.
And now, because of the brutality
of a louse..
..who humiliated me in front of you
...to bring us to his level.
All of a sudden,
nothing is the same.
What was beautiful and right
has become wrong.
We're both guilty.
Especially me.
- Go back to Simone.
- Are you serious?
Simone needs you.
He needs me, l know.
Then what?
Don't l count for anything?
What'll we do?
Help Simone.
This is madness!
We thought we were starting anew.
lnstead we were only doing harm.
l'll go
to church for my sermons.
l love you.
You love me.
What'll become of our love?
Why torture me like this?
We must stop.
lt's not possible.
You can't mean that, Rocco.
lf you do you'll regret it..
..and it'll be too late.
l hate you! Hate you!
l hate you! l hate you!
No luck tonight.
The house wins.
Place your bets. Your bets.
Rien ne va plus.
One card.
Let's hope this time, huh?
The bank pays. Pass.
Quiet! We're playing here.
And me,
like an idiot, up there,..
..with Madonnas and Saints,
crying away, in despair.
What a bummer!
Poor Nadia.
You'll get over it.
Forget all about it.
Forget, right!
l'm hurting.
And there's someone hurting
just like me.
Look who's here! He's
the cause of all our hurts.
The ''real'' victim!
What's with her?
We brought him to ruin.
We brought him to ruin,
can you imagine?
l beg your pardon.
You crazy?
l'm crazy...
...must be!
But it's your brother's idea.
Yes, Rocco, his brother.
Know what he said?
To go back to him,
to console him.
He's unhappy, the poor thing.
He can't make it alone.
He needs someone's help.
l don't want trouble.
lf she's drunk, take her away.
l beg your pardon? Ask nicely.
l'm a lady,
so treat me accordingly.
- You can't just give me
the boot. - Calm down.
- Hear him? Kicking me out.
- Calm down.
lt's not the first time
someone's tried that.
- You keep your mouth shut!
- Calm down.
So you're coming back?
l'm ready if you are.
Back with you, never!
l hate you.
l hate you.
Never!
l'd rather die first!
l warn you, come near me
and l'll spit in your face.
ln front of everybody
l'll spit in your face.
Cut it out, you two!
- Stop making trouble,
both of you! - Let go.
Don't come any closer.
- What do you want?
- Come here.
- Let go!
- Come on.
Sure, with Rocco's permission.
Let's go.
For an hour or forever?
- Even forever.
- Why not?
You or someone else,
makes no difference.
Let's go.
Let's go, huh!
Come on!
No, forget it,
l never loved you.
Seconds out.
Keep your guard up
and hit his bad eye..
..where the cut is.
Bash him! Understand?
Round three. Last round.
Rocco! Rocco!
Your attention, please.
By a knockout,
the winner: Rocco Parondi,..
..representing the ltalian team.
Rocco! Rocco!
You all right?
Are you okay, Rocco?
Winning came easy, Ciro,..
..because
l wasn't fighting him..
..but someone who drew
out of me the hatred..
..that has grown inside me
without my knowing.
lt's a bad feeling.
You can't imagine how bad.
How's that possible, Rocco?
There's nothing bad in you.
Come on, Rocco, cheer up!
You'll be great.
A real champion.
Ciro, that's enough,
my Father's waiting.
- Come on. - Ciro, that's enough,
my Father's waiting..
l have to tell you something.
What is it?
- You love me?
- Yes.
Give me a kiss?
Here, Ciro?
Why not?
Papa's waiting.
Hi, Papa.
What fun!
- Hi! - Good evening.
- You told him?
l forgot. Papa said to come
over tomorrow night.
He wants to know
if our intentions are serious.
l can answer right now.
No, tomorrow. Let's give him
a chance to escape.
- Ciao, Ciro.
- See you tomorrow...
- Yeah, a nice boy.
- Ciro!
- You won't go back
to the dance hall? - Of course not.
Go straight home, huh?
No dancing without me, ever!
Get in, it's cold.
Ciao!
Ciao, Franca.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
You're the fourth, huh?
We've already met.
Remember?
She's Simone's woman.
He's back too. He's inside.
- Ciro, come here a minute!
- Coming, Mamma.
No knives in this house?
Here they are.
Here's the cure
for your brother's hangover.
Ciro, my son....
Rest now. We'll settle
everything tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
There's no tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
There is no tomorrow.
Ciro, my dear son, tell me:
is all that's happening my fault?
Taking my strong, handsome
sons here to better themselves,..
..and not toil a thankless land
like their father..
..who died a thousand times
before giving up...
You did well!
Your father couldn't bring
himself to leave the land.
But during the 25 years
we spent together..
..l thought of nothing but
leaving, leaving, leaving...
l wanted it for Vincenzo,
Simone, Rocco and for you.
Nothing seemed beautiful there.
That world was so small.
Here l feel
as lf l could touch the sky.
People on the street called me
''Madam'', imagine....
..me, ''Madam'',
here, in this big city.
Thanks to my wonderful boys.
But now,
everything's gone wrong
Rocco's left home, and acts
as though a curse is on him.
And Simone, my dear Simone,
lives with a whore!
- Want some?
- No.
Yeah, it's pretty revolting.
Don't cry.
l'll think of something.
Leave it to me.
l must talk to my brother.
You're irresponsible.
A little respect for our mother.
Look, l'm fed up
with all your preaching!
This is my house too,
and l bring who l want.
l already
owe the hotel 60,000 liras.
Wanna pay it?
Anyway, there's room here.
Rocco's with Vincenzo.
That gives us an extra bed.
Any objections?
- Leave me alone.
- We'll discuss it tomorrow.
We'll discuss it
when l feel like it.
Don't blame me now.
The only one who's losing out is me.
Let's get that straight.
You got a cigarette?
l don't smoke.
He doesn't smoke.
l should've known.
He doesn't smoke, but l do
and l'm out of cigarettes.
Poor Mamma, she even has
to make that woman's bed.
l know
l'm more ashamed than you.
Whether brothers or not..
..we're seeds taken from
the same sack meant to bear fruit.
A seed gone bad must be weeded out.
..like we did
when cleaning lentils.
And all this
isn't good for young Luca.
Simone hasn't changed,
he's just demoralized.
His pride has been wounded
Let me try again, just once more.
l know what to do.
Cerri's very interested in me.
l'll fight for him,..
..he knows l might leave
if he lets Simone fight too.
l wouldn't do it if....
Let me try,
l'll manage somehow.
Do it for me.
lf only
we had never left home...
But it was our destiny
yours and mine,..
..and Simone's.
lmagine all the misery
had we remained there.
But we'd still be close.
Rocco!
We're here to work out!
l'm coming.
l'll never understand you.
l know.
See him?
...that man in the car?
- Tell him l'll be waiting
at the bar. - All right.
A cognac.
No fight? You're scared?
l don't feel good.
Then why hang out here?
Snap out of it!
How about a drink in a nice
quiet place, huh?
All right.
Simone, it's late.
Go away.
Leave me alone!
Got a cigarette?
These are for later.
Feel better?
l will, far from here.
Got the jitters?
lt happens when you realize
that punches ruin your profile.
Where we going?
Your place?
l was sure
you'd ask me one day.
- How much?
- 200 liras.
Thank you.
l see
your courage is coming back.
Better late than never.
You like my place?
Come in, don't worry.
lt's your first time here?
Feeling better?
Calmer now?
Sit down.
l need money.
Lots.
l understood that.
lt's not the first time,
is it?
The Champ!
l predicted it.
You couldn't last.
And to think..
..when l first saw you
at ''The Lombard Club'', you were....
An Apollo.
A real Apollo.
You're through..
..as a boxer.
And as a man.
Only somebody like me
can use a wreck like you.
l need money.
To pay for your whores?
That's one way..
..to save face,
isn't it?
Let me drink.
Guzzle it.
Nobody's weighing you in.
l'll tell you straight off:
..you're a shit!
Don't pull that one.
Not on me!
You can't talk
like that, understand?
- Ciro!
- Yeah, Ma.
- Come here. Hurry up.
- l'm coming.
What is it?
Get a move on!
- What's happened?
- They're looking for Simone.
lt's the police.
lt seems they have a warrant.
What's it all about?
Go to your room.
Don't worry.
My brother Simone
didn't come home last night.
He rarely sleeps here,
hardly ever.
- Take a look.
- Never mind.
Why do you want him?
We're here to bring him in.
There are charges against him.
That's all.
- l'd like to know more
- Come along.
Come in. l'll get dressed.
This is Simone?
Yes, my brother,
when he was still boxing.
l'm ready.
l'm going to the police station.
The police want him.
What'd he do? You know?
No, not this time,
but l can imagine.
He's rotten.
You know it's true.
How can you say that
about others? What nerve!
With you here, l'm ashamed
to show my face.
You allowed me to stay only
to keep Simone with you.
l've been rotting here!
No, squatting here
is what you've been doing!
Take your rags, and go!
He said he'd keep me.
He can't keep a woman like me.
He's a bum!
He can't work,
can't even steal.
Yes, steal!
You whore!
You ruined him.
The son everybody envied.
When he's rid of you,..
..he'll be his old self.
May you be damned! - Don't do that!
Don't worry, l'm going.
No, he must tell you
when to go.
No, why should l stay?
Simone has hit the bottom.
That's exactly what l wanted,
l'm happy now.
Make Rocco understand how
useless our sacrifice was.
l've no desire
to tell him myself.
l want to go, and never see
any of you again.
Out! Out! Get out!
He thought l was afraid.
l told him:
..''You touch that money
and l'll report you''.
He started laughing.
l watched him break open
the drawer.
Tell them you found the money,
that you misplaced it.
l'll sign an lOU.
Cerri will guarantee for me.
You think l'd risk
going to the police..
..for a lousy 60 or 70
thousand liras?
For a year now he's been
speculating on my generosity.
Tell me what he owes you,
and that's it!
lt's not just the money.
l stuck my neck out..
..covering for him..
..with a band of smugglers.
l asked you how much he owes!
400 thousand.
l'll pay with notes
in 3 months.
You crazy?
We'll be ruined.
Don't count on me,
l can't help.
Ginetta's expecting and
we've got furniture installments.
This concerns only me.
You can't, where'll you find
all that money?
He doesn't make sense,
you tell him.
l told him,
l can't help.
l got a family,
you know that.
You sure Cerri will guarantee
for you?
You ask him.
lt's still crazy,
even if Cerri agrees.
How'll you pay him back?
He promised me good money
if l sign for 10 years.
We'll go to Brussels, London...
besides, what do you care?
Hello, is Cerri there?
Tell him it's Duilio.
You didn't want to box..
..yet you're ruining your life
for that delinquent.
Then tell me..
..another way to save
Simone from his fate.
Yes, hold on.
lt's Cerri. He's on the line.
Rocco, think it over.
Wait. He's coming.
Cerri? Rocco.
Yes, of course. l understand.
Whatever you say.
We did what we could,
Ciro. Our conscience,..
..is clear.
When Rocco's set on something,
there's no stopping him.
ln fact, l'm....
ln fact, l'm accepting
your terms.
Agreed.
Alright.
All right, tomorrow.
Yes, tomorrow.
Fine.
Four, five.
This is for you,
but get out of Milan for a while.
You got no job to lose.
Besides, any place
is the same to you.
Stay out of the house!
Did the ''Court of Brothers''
decide that?
- Who needs them?
- Just as well.
Let's make a pact.
Since you have money
for that bastard, Duilio,..
..maybe you've some ''change''
for your brother.
200 thousand,
and l'll split for good.
l'll personally see you get
another 100 thousand..
..as soon as Rocco collects.
He'll get another payment
after his next fight.
Then l'll wait.
We're going. Come on, Luca.
Let him go!
- No!
- Cool it.
l don't have measles.
Get off your high horse.
Who are you, anyway?
Mr. skilled worker
at the Alfa Romeo plant?
Some career!
He's even proud of it!
- You're pitiful.
- Get outta here!
- Hear that, Luca?
- Yes.
He said l'm pitiful.
Luca, let's go!
Rocco! Rocco!
He's coming.
Did you sleep?
How you feeling?
- Ciao, Rocco.
- Ciao.
How about a rubdown?
A light massage.
Just a quick rub.
- He won't feel a thing.
- Rub his legs, too.
- My left arm aches.
- lt's nothing.
Simone!
Tickets for the fight?
You promised!
Got it in for me?
l promised nothing.
l'm not going either.
Yeah, and it's killing you.
Poor guy,
he's not going either.
Ever since he quit,
boxing makes him sick.
You quit? You don't throw
punches anymore?
No, got tired of it.
You know the story about
the fox and sour grapes?
- No, l don't.
- Poor guy, he doesn't remember.
Then let's refresh his memory.
What's going on, guys?
- Ciao.
- Ciao, lvo. - Ciao.
You want a cigarette?
Hey, some of us here..
..saw with their own eyes
how he tamed..
..Rocco the champion.
Those who saw it will never
forget that night.
- l was there.
- But l'd like to see..
..the brothers now
facing each other.
- Who'll get the brunt this time?
- That's a thought!
But now, we've got
to stage it..
..over by the canal.
l heard..
..that Nadia's working together
with a woman near Ravizza..
..who rents out rooms and cars.
''Nadia, the motorized hooker,
who does her clients..''
''..in a car, along the canal!''
lvo, are you sure?
Look, his ears perked up.
lf we wanted,
we could organize another night..
..like before.
ls your brother still pining
for the motorized hooker?
Or does he aim higher?
Simone, where you going?
Come back here.
Where you going?
Simone!
Simone!
What a crowd!
All the champs are here!
You show them, Rocco!
Give me some water. l'm parched.
No, it bloats the stomach.
Then give me some lemon.
Well...?
What is it?
Money? You want money?
l haven't any.
See, it's empty.
- l'm not interested.
- l don't want....
You can't say no.
Come back to me.
With you l can start
over again.
- Us two?
- Yes.
- Together again?
- Yes.
lmpossible. Go, go away!
- Nadia!
- Go away!
Help!
- Help!
- Nadia!
Wait! Don't shout!
Sir! Don't leave me.
Don't leave me alone!
Nadia, cover yourself,
it's cold.
Don't shout. Why are you
shivering?? You're afraid?
Look how l'm shivering.
Don't be afraid.
l'm not afraid,
leave me alone!
Honey, no! Nadia!
Why doesn't he cover himself?
He's bleeding again.
Get that left up!
Cover yourself!
Cover up, it's cold.
l made you suffer.
Say it,..
..my love....
You've no idea how much l hate you.
You're a beast.
Everything you touch
becomes foul,..
..vulgar.
l hope never to see you again.
Or hear of you again.
You ruined the only beautiful
thing of my life.
You! You criminal!
l spit in your face all
the loathing l feel.
Do what you want now.
l don't care anymore.
l don't want to die!
''The winner:
Rocco Parondi!''
Boy, l was scared when he
clipped you. Did it hurt?
For a while l couldn't see him.
lt was like shadow boxing.
You could have come too, Mamma.
lt wouldn't have scared you.
- You happy?
- Delighted.
- To the future champion
of ltaly! - ....and the world!
l'll be truly happy the day..
..when all my sons
reunite around this table..
..like the five fingers
of my hand.
Drink up
to the health of my Rocco.
To your success.
Some sparkling wine!
We must celebrate.
And you, Vincenzo,..
..have to make a nice toast.
- Stand up, Vincenzo!
Maria!
Signora Lucia! Come along!
The whole neighborhood is out!
Come in, come in.
Come on, everybody.
Go on, Rocco!
Go on! Your health!
Your health!
Come in.
Have a seat.
Make yourselves at home.
Quiet...
Vincenzo is going to make
a toast.
- Go on, Vincenzo!
- What can l say?
Let's see....
''Before l lose this rhyme,
let me think,..''
''..bottoms up,
with a sparkling drink!''
Vincenzo, that was lovely.
''This wine, so fine
and wonderful..''
''..l drink to your health.''
Shame on you, Ciro!
They'd have shot you back home.
He's changed.
He's become
citified like Ginetta.
- lt's your turn, Rocco.
- Forget it!
- No way!
- Come on..
All right,
everybody outside, let's go.
Thank you, thank you!
''This glass l raise..''
''..and drink to your health..''
''..hoping you're all happy
to share in our wealth.''
Quiet, just a moment.
l thought somebody rang
the doorbell.
- Go take a look,
l'm certain. - No, Ma.
No, Ma, there's nobody there.
- No one?
- No.
No one.
Finish your toast. Let's see
if you're better at it.
No one's better, Ciro.
l'm not better than you.
What l'd like to toast..
..is the day, still far off,
when l'll be able..
..to go back home.
lf l can't, l hope..
..one of us
will one day return to our land.
Maybe you.
l'd go with you.
Remember, Luca, ours is the land
of the olive tree,..
..the moon
and rainbows....
Do you remember, Vincenzo?
before building a house,
the head mason threw a brick..
..at the shadow
of the first person who happened by.
Why?
As a token of sacrifice..
..to have the house
come up solid.
This time someone did ring.
Wait, l'll go.
l knew it. My heart said
it was you.
l'm happy now. Come on!
Your brothers are all here.
Come on!
Have you eaten anything?
l'll heat something for you.
Tell me what you want.
- What now?
- Ciro, don't!
l have to ask you to leave.
l'm sorry.
What's wrong, Simone?
What's wrong?
l was so happy.
Tell her to shut up. Tell her!
- Come, we have to talk.
- l know...
But in front of everybody!
No! To me, only to me.
Only to me.
Speak up!
l'm not here because you won.
l don't give a damn.
l need money.
l need it now!
- We made a pact!
- Get out, Ciro!
Come to me for whatever
you need, understand?
Only to me.
You're hurt.
What is this?
- lt's blood.
- Blood?
She kept hanging on to me.
- l couldn't shake her off.
She didn't want to die! - No!
- Simone!
- l killed her.
No!
Don't worry,
no one saw me.
- lt's all over.
- No!
You happy now, Champ?
lsn't that what you wanted?
lt's my fault, l know.
My fault!
My boy! Simone, my son!
Rocco...
l left her there,
down by the water.
lt's all over, Rocco, all over.
Mamma....
Jealousy, that's the reason.
lt blinded him!
- Turn yourself in!
- He's your brother! - Unfortunately!
l don't believe
in the justice of men.
lt's not for us to judge him,
but to help him,..
..to save him.
l'll take care of everything.
That's not helping him!
- What happened?
- Where you going?
- What is it?
- l know what l'm doing.
lt's useless!
He got rid of that curse!
Have you gone crazy too?
Shame on you,
turning on your own Mother!
Christ will regret
the suffering he visited upon us!
Don't curse!
lt serves no purpose.
We're no longer in God's grace.
We're our own enemies.
We've all become enemies.
Why curse? We're all to blame.
We must pay for our faults.
- Ciro's gone...!
- Ciro!
Wait!
- Ciro!
- Ciro!
Stop!
For Papa's sake, don't do it!
- Ciro!
- Ciro!
There's no hope now.
Well? What is it?
They took him away
this morning.
They found him on the roof..
..hiding behind
the water tanks.
He spent 3 nights there.
Satisfied?
You wanted to turn him in.
You're the big shot
of the house now.
When you're older you'll
realize how unfair you've been.
How unfair
you've all been to me.
No one loved Simone
more than l did.
l was a kid
when we left home,..
..and it was Simone, not
Vincenzo who made me understand,..
..that in our home town
we were beasts of burden,..
..confined to work
and blind obedience.
We are not slaves,
he said, but we must not..
..neglect our responsibilities.
But he forgot all that.
And, in so doing, ended up
the way he did,..
..ruining himself,
and bringing shame on us all.
He hurt Rocco, and you too,
our youngest brother.
Simone once had good roots.
But he let weeds overtake him.
Even Rocco's goodness
and generosity are misplaced.
Rocco's a saint, but what
can he do in this world?
He won't defend himself.
He's so forgiving.
But one mustn't always forgive.
lf Rocco goes back,
l want to go with him.
l doubt he'll see
our home town again.
You might, some day.
But what do you think
you'll find there?
Things will change
there too.
Even there, they realize
that things must change.
Many have little faith
in a changed world,..
..but l do.
You, Luca, will lead a more
upright, honest life.
The siren.
l have to go back.
- Give Mamma a kiss for me.
- Uh uh.
- Ciao, Luca.
- Ciao.
Ciro!
Ciro!
- Ciao.
- How are you?
- Fine.
- Why did you come?
- Ciao.
- Ciao, how are you?
- Hey, it's late.
- l'll be right there!
l came to tell you
l love you.
l do too... forever!
Ciro!
What is it?
Come home tonight!
We'll be waiting. Ciao.
l'll come.
#ln my home town
where l was born,..#
#..l left my heart
there forlorn.#
