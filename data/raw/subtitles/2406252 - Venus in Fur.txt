MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND
THUNDER
 No, no. This does not exist!
A young sexy guy who knows how to express himself...
..
classical training with a vague talent and just a bit 'of the brain in the head.'
Not one who knows how to pronounce "inextricable"...
.. without having done a course in diction.
Well ', listen... THUNDER
 (Marie-Cécile) Why do you say that?
Turn to some agent.
 These actresses, young and brave.
- Yes  I can handle it.
At that time a woman was married at Vanda's age.
...
.. had five children and had come down with tuberculosis.
Instead today all girls talk like they're ten years old...
.. and have breathed helium:
"Too, too cool!"
"It's one thing that rocks!"
I have a parade of more than thirty bitches...
..
Half dressed as bitches and the other half as lesbians.
Vanda or I would be better
than most of those girls.
Just put on a dress and a pair of socks
you're done.
Hello? Hello, darling?
Oh, damn... Hello?
- Fuck!
 (Vanda) Knock, knock.
I arrived late, right?
Oh shit!
 Holy shit! - If you are coming
for "Venus in Fur"...
.. everyone left half an hour ago.
I'm sorry, but I was
on the other side of Paris.
My phone was charging,
I broke a heel...
.. on one of those ventilation grilles
that no one knows where they are.
And then there was a guy on the subway
who rubbed himself on me...
.. Everything's this way.
And finally, the storm came.
I'm soaked to the bone!
Holy cow, it's
my day.
Holy shit bitch!
Maybe there's a Valium in the medicine cabinet, want to look?
No, it's just my luck.
Thank you, Lord,
for making my life easier.
By the way, let me introduce myself.
- Vanda Jourdain.
- Who? Vanda?
Do you understand?
I even have the right name.
Do you know a lot of girls who call themselves "Vanda"?
I was made for that part...
.. and she takes the subway stop in the tunnel with the
turn.
- And your name is?
- Thomas Novachek.
Pleasure... Hey, wait a minute!
- You are the author.
- Yes, well... no.
I did the script.
- Yes, but you are also the director, right?
- Yes, I would say yes.
I love your work
at least the ones I know.
"Anatomy of a shadow," great!
I saw it twice!
Not me.
Oh! But that was stupid.
- I meant that other one.
- What other? 
- What a shame.
However, this one is too radical,
at least from what I've read.
Er 'rather risqué, right?
Sexy in my opinion.
Or erotic, kind if you like
humiliation and stuff like that.
I do not usually go around
dressed in leather wearing a dog collar...
.. I'm a reserved type.
But I thought that I would help me get into the
part.
- It's S & M stuff?
- Not exactly.
- It's set in 1870.
- Ah, I see.
- Not much of this in 1870, right?
- No, not really.
- Perhaps the sadomasochistic ones dressed
like this. 
- Yeah, I'll go find out.
- I brought a photo and a resume.
- Very well, thank you.
Where are they? Here...
- Here's the picture... and the script.
- Thank you.
True, it's a bit short
but I was made for this part.
I starred in Hedda Gabbler
and they said I was fabulous.
- The Theatre of the urinal?
- Yes
I have not had the pleasure of following
their last season.
You had an appointment for this audition?
At 2 pm or 3... a little 'time ago.
- Vanda... what did you say?
- Jourdain?
Everyone always asks me if it's a stage name.
I don't see your name here.
Really? 
My agent swore that it was all right.
- I'm not on the list?
- Please, leave.
Fuck! Well, thanks, sir.
- But since I'm here...
- Wait, what does?
I also know the scene!
- No!
- Wait!
- I even have a costume.
- It's useless.
- You don't want me to audition?
- I do not want to do it. No!
- Since I'm here we might try.
- They're all gone.
- There is no one to run your lines.
- You can do it.
For me it would be an honor to have the author do the scene with me.
- The author.
- Fantastic!
- Directly from the author.
- Okay, stop!
- To tell the truth, Miss...
- Vanda.
-
Try something different. 
- Oh yeah?
- Who do you want?
- Someone a bit more...
.. how to say...
Okay, don't try so hard.
Someone who is not me.
Too short, too tall,
too old, too young...
My resume is too short,
okay I understand.
- But no, wait.
- I've pissed you off.
- Calm down.
- It's not fair.
Really, I've had enough.
My day was a nightmare.
You can arrange other auditions.
I'm here now, I'd avoid
having to come back tomorrow.
Even my day was very stressful too.
I auditioned an army of failures.
One even had braces on her teeth.
- Now would not be the time.
- Okay. - I need to rest.
- Then I'll have some for dinner.
- Yes, I understand.
It will be better to do it when I'm less tired.
Thank you for coming and congratulations on the dress.
- I'll see you soon.
- I wish it were so, but it's nice to say it.
You look like a decent person.
This is a shitty job...
.. not to mention the thirty euros
for this shitty costume.
- Do not you find this face
"1800 something"? 
- Of course!
- It is very Vanda, right?
- Very lovely.
I think wearing a dress this long...
.. because at that time everyone hated asses.
- This is a misstatement.
- I see how it is.
CELLPHONE RINGS Please, be nice!
- Yes?
- Thank you.
Oh, I must have lost track of the time.
No, no!
I am not speaking to you,
someone has just came in.
No, No. I don't know.
Then I'll take the sushi
just get takeout.
Hello.
Can you help me close it?
Thomas Novachek in person will give me the lines.
It won't be much help,
I'm not an actor.
Come on, you're perfect.
You'll crush Kowalski.
- No, Kushemski.
- Kushemski.
- You are Kushemski.
- OK, all done.
At your service, sir.
Where do we start?
You choose. I don't care..
Let's try the first scene.
Okay.
- It has its fair share?
- Yes
- It's a bit the worse for wear.
- Is that the full text?
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know.
- I got it from my agent.
- And where did he get it?
Is this a problem? Is it top secret?
Should not I see it?
It's not important.
- Have you read it?
- Yes, in passing, on the subway.
I have seen that is adapted from something.
From a song by Lou Reed
"Venus in furs?"
No, it is taken from a novel by an Austrian author
"The Venus in Fur" by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
I bet you know how to read Austrian
and have read it in the original version.
Actually yes.
The book caused a scandal when it was published in 1870.
I believe it!
It's a porn BDSM.
- This is not a porn BDSM.
- You don't think it's porn?
Not even a little?
Since it was written in the Middle Ages,
in 1800 or something?
"Venus in Fur"
is a beautiful love story...
It's a masterpiece.
It's one of the great texts of world literature.
Ah, yes? For me, it's a porno.
Sadomasochism, I know what it is, I work in the theater.
The term "masochism" comes from Sacher-Masoch and
from this book.
Ah! Masochism-Masoch.
I get it!
So this guy has given his name to sadomasochism.
Cool.
- It was not his intention.
- I see.
He believed he had written a good novel
and they all said it was porn.
- You have plagiarized the book?
- No, I adapted it.
I reinvented the dialogue, the situations and...
- There is so much of me in here.
- Great!
Genius! Where does it take place?
In a hotel that is located on a remote
mountain in the eastern part of...
.. the Imperial Austro-Hungarian Empire.
- Let me remember.
- It's complicated.
- It's a nice place?
Yes, it is a spa for wealthy people...
.. a luxurious place.
The curtain rises and Kushemski is in his room.
He is reading his book while drinking coffee.
And then... knock knock! Cue Vanda.
It is symbolic from the point of view 
of the character?
No, but there are still people who read the book.
- Sometimes even the real book, on paper. 
- Ah, you caught me.
This fellow, what's his name?
Sevran, Severan, Savrìne ..
- Severin Von Kushemski.
- That's it..
What kind of person is he?
Young? Tell me some adjectives.
Something. What?
Rich, idle, typical of his era,
smart traveler, cultured.
- An intellectual.
- So to speak.
- Ah, "so to speak." I love it.
- I haven't heard anyone talk like that in a long time.
- I wouldn't know.
- So she is a distinct type?
- You want me to talk about the character?
Yes, I know it by heart... but
yes, please, if you like!
I would say that from many points of view
she is a young woman of her time...
.. in spite of the principles she professes, but...
- In spite of what?
Of the principles she professes.
At first glance she is a person
in place, poised and very cultured.
As you say! Anything else?
Something that I do not already know?
Never mind, I'll manage.
- Will it bother you if I change lighting?
- The lighting!
It's a bit' too much, don't you think?
Please,
make yourself at home.
Is that better?
Not bad.
Wait.
I don't know how to work that.
OK. That's much better.
I guess this is the sofa.
Yes, it's the sofa.
A desk?
The book that is discussed?
There is a postcard, fantastic!
What is this?
- A phallic symbol?
- There are remnants of the previous show.
A Belgian production of...
.. "Stagecoach"
adapted to musical comedy.
Where would you like me to stand?
Where do you prefer...
.. less at the center.
 Side yard?
- Garden.
-Garden?
You want to re-read the text before you start?
No, let's begin. Up to where?
- End of page three.
- Okay. And then throw me out, right?
- You want me to to try?
- And then throw me out.
- Look, I...
 Ah, yes! I forgot...
- The phrase that on the first page,
The citation.  The epigraph?
Yes, that one.
"The Lord Almighty
struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."
Is a quote that appears in the novel,
It's taken from the Book of Judith.
 It's in the Bible?
- In the Apocryphal books of the Bible, yes.
I do not know anything about that.
- Ah, yes.
Don't you think it's sexist?
"The Lord Almighty
struck him and put him in the hands of a woman."
I just mentioned the novel of Sacher-Masoch
.
 Yes, but since you put it on page
zero...
It does not matter, does not concern me,
I'm just an actress. But you...
 Forgot the fur!
- She's wearing a stole, right?
- Yes, indeed.
Fur, fur...
soft fur...
Maybe not...
This...
Good ..
(she begins voice warmups)
The socks are dry and the Duchess is
arch-dry.
The socks are dry and the Duchess is
arch-dry.
Ka ke ke ke.
Ka ke ke ke.
- When you're ready.
- "The tea has cured your stubborn cough?"
"If you will not leave the role."
(Blows rasberries)
 Toc toc.
- She enters.
 Herr Doktor von Severin
Kushemski?
I'm sorry if I'm bothering you.
My name is Vanda von Dunayev.
I am in the room above you.
Last night I found this book,
a copy of "Faust"...
.. with your bookmark inside.
I was sitting under the birches,
near the statue of Venus.
Thank you very much.
I had just asked the waitress to look for it..
I found it and there is a postcard inside.
This is a Titian, right?
 Yes
"Venus in the mirror,"
one of my favorite paintings.
Your Venus looks to be well used...
.. just like your book.
She is faithful?
- Excuse me?
- Original?
Yes, it is a copy...
faithful to the original.
I understand your infatuation,
it's a ravishing picture.
Thanks for having troubled to bring it back.
I could not help noticing the strange
poem written on the back.
"Venus In Fur".
Did you write it?
- Those are poor, poor verses.
- Shoddy? really?
"To love and be loved, or as a charm..."
".. yet, stronger, more beautiful still .."
".. is this torment that consumes me."
"I will kiss this woman
I am a victim..."
".. the slave miserable..."
".. submissive, the footrest."
"My goddess, my dictator..."
".. my Venus in Furs."
 The sentiments are interesting.
If I were you, I'd take better care of this.
I appreciate your discretion.
Want to sit for a moment?
Thank you.
- May I take your coat?
- Very kind of you.
This fur is a tartar, right?
A sable of the Caucasus?
I would say of Kazakhstan.
Yes, a tartar sable from Kazakhistan, exactly.
Kushemski, standing, observes
the fur between his hands.
But you are trembling Kushemski.
Yes, I pray you to forgive me.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Gladly.
- A coffee would be perfect.
- Then take mine.
How kind!
- Two lumps, please.
- He serves coffee...
I hope the noise above doesn't bother you
when I walk in heels.
I'd give anything in the world.
To hear you walk so well in your heels.
So you're a poet,
Herr Kuskhemski?
A waste of time.
And a passionate expert on fur?
The love of fur...
- Skip this measure, the following is
... - No, read it.
The love of fur is innate.
a passion given to all by nature.
Put in a little more effort.
The love of fur is innate.
a passion given to all by nature.
Caress a soft and thick fur...
.. hear that particular crackle, that electricity...
I think that it is not only a gift of nature.
Your mother
wrapped you up in a sable when you were little?
But that's indiscreet.
 I beg your pardon.
- No, I...
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.
- So that explains it.
- We are all easily explained.
- But we remain intractable.
- Inextricable?
- What do you mean? 
- Life makes us what we are?
End of page three.
THUNDER
Actually yes...
- That was going very well, Vanda.
- I was looking for footholds.
- I did what I could.
- Seemed very solid.
That's what it means to be
able to create an atmosphere.
- I am a professional.
- Really, it was...
- Stop it, I'll blush.
- I did not say it was perfect.
- No, of course.
- Let's go on a little more.
Kushemski - After that he makes his big speech...
.. you go to...
- Read, it helps me to get into character. Please recite.
- You read well, Thomas.
- No, it's an impression.
You read really well.
- Have you already thought of someone for Kushemski? 
- Not really.
- I have several options.
- You could do it yourself.
- Yes, of course!
- I think so seriously.
- You would be very good.
- No, it's quite difficult.
- Does the director inflict this on all the actors?
- It is his job.
- I'm directing for the first time.
- Doesn't look like it.
I decided to do this because
directors never understand anything.
- You have no idea what I have endured...
- That's why it's perfect.
- You know what to do.
- I have everything in my head.
I want to use the "Lyric Suite"
by Alban Berg for the transitions...
- a great idea!
- He knows the "Lyric Suite"?
No, but you understand what I mean?
You know the story of the inner life,
of the characters, everything! - Yes.
What accent Kushemski should have...
.. or something of the kind.
- He's a distinguished man.
Yes, distinguished 
- And with that, I don't know...
.. an aristocrat.
he moves like this...
Or is that just stupid?
a little.
It's silly but it is fantastic.
- For this scene he would wear
a dressing gown? - Yes
- You're joking!
- Want to try it?
Buck up, I'll help.
But it is magnificent.
- Am I wrong or is it vintage?
- So I'm told.
Siegfried Mueller...
.. Vienna...
.. 1869.
I hadn't seen that.
40 euros at the flea market.
Seems tailor-made for him.
- How does it look?
- Very good.
It is close to my size.
- You look great.
- Yes
Hello, sweet guy.
And the dog collar?
It is a reminder of the period in which I beat the pavement.
Joke!
Let's pick up a few lines back.
Your mother
wrapped you up in a sable when you were a little baby?
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.
- For him it is tough to say this.
- Yes, it's no wonder.
- Then take courage.
- Yes
That was indiscreet,
please forgive me.
It was one of my aunts
who had a real passion for fur.
- So that explains it.
- We are all easily explained.
But we remain inexplainable.
Inexplainable?
What do you mean?
Life makes us what we are
in an unpredictable moment.
Is the coffee to your liking?
I just tasted it. It's excellent.
This is symbolic, right?
The coffee is...
.. and she has just tasted
but is already excited.
Ln fact, I was suprised.
Have you ever experienced such a surprising moment
Mister Kushemski?
In reality, yes, but I will not bother you.
On the contrary, it fascinates me.
Like one of those English detective novels
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.
- We could skip this part.
- No, read it. I want to hear it.
He had a mysterious aunt who loved fur.
I was a child from hell...
.. spoiled and cruel.
Mean to our maids and our cat.
I behaved very badly with one of my aunts.
The Countess was a woman
majestic, voluptuous and terrible ..
- What is it?
- Nothing.
just saying aloud the words that I wrote
...
.. two in the morning on a screen
looked different.
You're doing great!
What did your aunt do?
One evening he is avenged.
She came into my room...
.. with her big black Russian fox coat
In her hand she held a rod,
a branch of birch...
..
With her were the cook and the maid.
She took off her coat and she rolled up his sleeves...
.. I tried to escape...
.. but the other two women
took hold of me,..
I lowered my pants and she threw me on the fur.
I held still while my aunt
punished me with the rod.
My buttocks and my
naked thighs were on fire.
The maid encouraged her.
She made fun of me, treated me like a sissy
I danced away but my aunt continued to hit me...
.. until such time as
I begged her to stop...
.. out of pity.
When she finally stopped,
she forced me to thank her...
.. and kiss her feet.
Then she left room
threatening to come back.
And all this in the presence of the
maids...
.. and our cat.
From that moment...
.. fur to me more than simple fur...
.. nor a birch branch
a simple branch.
In a moment she made me who I am...
- And she came back?
- Yes
In my dreams, with her black fur
and her rod.
She comes to visit me again,
night after night.
- My poor friend.
 Poor?
She taught me the most valuable thing in the world
- And what did she teach you?
- That nothing is more sensual than pain.
That nothing is more exciting
than degradation.
The Countess did her job well.
It has become my ideal.
From that day I seek her double.
And when I meet this woman I will marry her.
This step is sensational!
Thanks, it took a lot of work.
In practical terms, it's like a play
child abuse?
It has nothing to do with it.
What the fuck does the maltreatment of children 
have to do with this story?
Holy cow, this craze nowadays...
.. bring everything to a social problem of cock.
- The abuse is not only...
- Do not follow stereotypes!
Do not talk about anthropology or sociology!
- Let's make theater.
- Yes, but...
Here there is much more at stake than
the issue of corporal punishment.
Okay, I'm sorry!
Most of the world live impoverished
and dull lives!
Why do we always try to bring
everything to something else?
What else will we pull out now?
sexism, racism, class struggle?
Well, you're certainly unique,
Herr Kushemski.
If I were you, I would be careful.
Your ideal woman could prove
more cruel than desired.
I am ready to take the risk.
I know what she is...
A supersensual person.
An ascetic of pleasure.
And you, Frau von Vanda Dunayev,
who or what are you?
I am a pagan.
Does that mean I'm young,
beautiful, rich...
.. and by that account able to derive 
more benefits than possible to others.
I do not deny anything.
I have the utmost respect for your principles.
I beg your pardon, but I do not care
for your respect.
I shall love the man in whom I take delight...
.. and take pleasure from the man 
who will make me happy...
.. but only until he ceases to
make me happy and then I'll find another.
For a man there is no greater cruelty
than the infidelity of a woman.
For a woman, it gets worse:
forced loyalty.
- I can move?
- Yes, yes... go ahead, move.
In our society...
woman can have power except through the intercession of a man.
What will become of the woman,
when she becomes equal to men?
When she becomes herself?
The Little Vanda is way
ahead of her time!
How do you know all the lines?
- I don't know. I learn quickly.
- You know all the text by heart!
You had said that Vanda
is very much in place in spite of what?
- Of the principles she professes.
- There are those. - Yes
According to her Vanda does not believe in all these stories.
'what it says...
Women's Rights, blah blah blah...
But she does, jerk7,
She has character, a mind of her own.
As said: "
the principles she professes" and not "her principles."
I think I very much liked the alliteration:
"of the principles she professes."
I see!
He sold his soul for alliteration.
'true, I plead guilty.
Just between us, Thomas,
she is a true tomboy.
If you allow, I would say that...
You are better than a pagan.
Seems to me you are a goddess.
- Really? And what?
- Venus.
And Vanda?
Is Venus really me or am I making this up?
Venus took the likeness of a 
human to come to haunt him?
Not really.
- Or rather, not exactly.
- Okay, it's so, and she wanted it.
- She wants it to be ambivalent.
- Ambiguous. - Yes, that one.
In fact it is the story of "The Bacchae."
Exactly.
What was "The Bacchae"?
- It's an old play, right?
- It's a very old play.
"Citizens of Corinth.
I stand before you a Testiculus...
.. a poor mortal cursed by the gods for his offenses...
.. and totally fucked up till the end of time."
- It's this kind of play?
- Yes
Dionysus descends to Earth and is the arrogant king of Thebes...
A quivering jelly dressed as a woman.
- It looks exciting.
After that, the wild women of Thebes
The Bacchae, broke him in pieces.
- And Dionysus returns to his home, triumphant.
- I think I saw it.
In our case, however, it is not
Dionysus but Aphrodite.
Of course.
Who is that?
- She is the Greek version of Venus.
- But it is the same person.
 The same goddess.
- Hail Aphrodite!
Hail, oh Aphrodite.
Am I unbearably pedantic?
Yes, but I find it cute.
Yes.
What do we do?
Seems to me a goddess...
Really? What?
Venus.
But Venus can rule only in a world of slaves.
 Then I'd better find one.
 Would you like to be my slave,
Kushemski Herr Doktor?
I already am.
I became your slave
the moment you entered this room.
Really? Are you already in love with me?
Deeply.
I am suffering as if I knew it all along.
- Submit to me.
- Stand up straight and turn away from me.
I must confess this intrigues me.
I love your frankness and the clarity of your thought.
From a physical point of view,
You have charms, no doubt.
But if a man submits himself to me, I set a trap...
I don't care about traps. 
Love me!
- You see? He has already begun to give orders. 
- Marry me!
I am a frivolous woman,
Herr Kushemski.
To love me, you will have to give proof of great courage
.
- I have already explained my principles.
- I do not care.
- I want you to be my wife.
- You do not know anything about me.
- I submit to you
- That's absurd.
I'll give you complete power over me,
for eternity.
Do with me what you wish.
- I submit, hit me if you want.
- This is unexpected news to me.
- Let's try it a new way.
- What way?
- Put yourself center stage upstage.
- No, I'm fine here.
You should move there!
Take the power and stand in a position of power.
OK. Continue.
- This is unexpected news to me.
- This isn't working.
Do not move, try it here.
I'll give you complete power over me
for eternity, unconditionally.
Do with me what you want.
I submit.
Hit me if you want.
- This is unexpected news to me.
- You don't even pretend to try?
You wanted me to go here,
So I went here.
It's just an audition.
I am listening also to see if you agree.
Do what I say and stay there.
I'll give you complete power over me
for eternity, unconditionally.
Do with me what you want.
I submit.
- You can hit me if you want.
- This unexpected news to me.
- You're right, it's better.
- Continue.
What do you want in the depths of your heart?
To belong to you...
..
to disappear in essence sublime...
.. to dress you and undress you...
.. to offer you stockings,
to put on your shoes .. .
.. to no longer have my own will.
 And that you call that love?
- It's the only love there is.
In love, as in politics
only one of the parties must have the power.
One must be the hammer and the other the anvil.
I gladly accept
to be the anvil.
Enough.
Go on, I like it!
Thomas, you are intelligence,
especially with regard to women.
- You really understand women.
- Yes, yes... years of study.
- Where was I?
- You are an anvil.
Vanda, I try
my pain is your pleasure.
You should not ever let
the feelings of others dominate.
The servant of his mistress lives to serve her.
I submit, squeeze me like a lemon.
You are incredible.
If you do not want me as a husband,
take me as a slave.
Treat me with divine cruelty.
Why should I mistreat those who love me?
- But I'd love it even more.
- I do not want to be adored.
All women want to be worshiped, as our Creator.
I am created! I am ruined!
I am reduced to a thing!
CELLPHONE RINGS
One moment, please excuse me.
 Hello? Yes
No, they are not out yet.
It's all right.
It's all good just...
I don't know.
At times, eh?
I'll call you when I get out?
Yeah, me too, my love.
- Yeah, so...
 Yes, all right.
Excuse me, huh?
You're not listening.
 This time it's a temporary agency,
maybe they have something for me?
A typist? Night work
in a major law firm.
The contract is for tomorrow.
Blah Blah Blah
 I don't know!
What will be, will be.
That's life. That's life little one. Bye!
- Crazy!
- Your better half?
 You think so?
- What did you call him?
- I don't know... asshole?
- Ah, okay.
- You wonder why I lied to you?
- No, it does not concern me.
Why do you say that Vanda?
"I do not deny anything,
There are other fish in the sea."
- Why do you talk like that?
- You're the hammer, he's the anvil.
What should I say?
"Yes, dear, whatever you want"?
This has nothing to do with love, but with
my ass.
If I say so,
You have to take it.
- This is dialogue from the play.
- Oh yeah?
You're making fun of me?
- I do not know, do you think I am?
- Will you stop pretending.
For once I cannot tell
what you are thinking.
Talking with you is more complicated than
doing the tango.
Want to go for a coffee?
Why do you say that?
- You're hitting on me?
- Absolutely not!
I'm just offering you a coffee.
- But it's symbolic coffee.
- No, no, it's a real coffee.
What would she say if your wife saw you give me a "real coffee"?
- I'm not married.
- Ah yes...
I thought so before the phone call.
- It was my fiancee.
- It's the same thing.
You would think that?
In an interview you said:
"The theater is the best way to get girls into bed."
Don't tell me that you read that stuff.
I was young,
it was my first interview.
- You have never been married?
- Never.
- You still live with your mother?
- I'm weird, but not that weird.
I fox fur her passion?
- No, it's love.
- She is really strange.
 And I want my woman to be my muse.
So your girlfriend has a pair of wings and everything else?
In the vision of love one must jump completely in.
 And she dives right in?
- Yes, like a fish...
.. with fireworks,
dizziness and thunder.
So, coffee yes? Or no coffee?
I can't conceive of a man giving me
his life only by becoming my slave.
I would say that we are not at all compatible
Herr Kushemski.
We will cancel each other out.
And I would say that we are made for each other.
Is that not what he feels, Vanda?
Is not that what you feel?
I propose we try a contract, as in business.
You will have a year to prove
you are the man I need.
- A year is a long time.
- I have not finished yet.
- I beg your pardon.
- You will be my slave for a year.
So you prepared everything.
You planned everything before entering here.
- Do you believe that?
- Stop being naive.
- It's you, you're the author of this. 
- I'm not sure I had everything ready.
I'm being sincere, I swear.
So you wanted this? You seem ambivalent.
- Ambiguous.
- That yes.
Or is it a slut you crave,
ready to enjoy everything.
A craving whore?
I had never thought of you as that.
It can be even more complicated.
"Be my slave for a year
and then I'll let you fuck me."
- She is always ambivalent, right?
- Ambiguous.
- Ambiguous. - From my point of view, rather than 
Kushemski's...
This could be his last chance. Maybe the only one.
And to do what?
- To live.
- Ok, good.
He loves the whip and wants to know if
she likes it too.
- He told her this?
- She understands him.
He is a weirdo and she is an object,
like all women of the 1800s.
What?
Who is she, then,
Frau Vanda Jourdain?
- I am a pagan.
- No, I'm serious.
Try again.
Where did you get this?
What is your story?
Daughter of the military, grew up around soldiers,
An orphan.
Where have you been? ln which cities
and which countries?
I will write a contract stipulating
that you will be my slave for a year.
- I'll be at your command.
- Done deal.
Let's shake on it.
- There's a real Greek at the hotel.
 A Greek? - Yes
He's from Athens.
Mounts a stallion as white as snow
wearing boots and black leather.
I want you to get me the number of his room.
- But, Vanda...
 What is it?
- Already reluctant to obey me?
- I beg your pardon.
Tomorrow I'll wait in the birch forest, near the statue of Aphrodite.
- At what time?  
Wait for me until such time as I decide to come.
- Very good. - Don't come
without the room number of the Greek.
Now kiss my foot.
And he kneels and kisses her foot.
I love this part, it is very direct.
Pass me my fur now.
Séverin, how will it end?
This depends only on you, Vanda
Frau von Dunayev, not on me.
Thanks for the coffee, slave.
OK, I'm leaving right now.
A coffee sounds good.
That was intense.
The handshake was electric.
The happiness of a time when people were more introverted.
A simple conversation emanated eroticism.
Conversation.
The only thing to put between your teeth.
The book begins like this, right?
- The book?
- Yes
Where is the beginning scene...
.. when Venus appears to be naked
wearing fur in front of the fireplace?
- You've read "The Venus in Furs"?
- I looked it over.
When you said you did not know about it
you lied.
OK, I lied a little.
- Why didn't you keep that scene?
- I did not know how to use it.
Just put it at the beginning, before the
guy with Vanda.
You can not think of doing
"The Venus in Furs" without Venus.
You can use the same actress
for Vanda and Venus.
- Naked on stage? That's no problem.
- Yes, I'll think about it.
- Why don't we improvise? 
It'll give you some ideas. 
- How?
You have to change the lights.
- Where we are at the beginning of the play?
- In Kushemski's room...
.. in the middle of the night.
Ok, middle of the night, two in the
morning.
Let's turn them down a little...
Fire in the fireplace,
side garden. There!
Yes, very well.
Kushemski What are you doing?
- I do not know... is he in bed?
- What a fantasy!
Too obvious?
He is reading
when he meets Vanda.
Do not read too early,
we are not in the library.
Perhaps he could be writing in his diary.
I like that.
Yes
OK I'm Venus.
Ah shit, who cares?
 Face me as if you were naked.
- You're hitting on me?
Imagine that I'm your girlfriend
and this is unexpected.
- Ah, it's the first time I've done this.
- You say that to all the girls.
Yes, but for me it is the truth.
The fire in the fireplace comes to life, we see Venus naked...
.. lasciviously wrapped in a fur coat...
- Uh huh
Now wrap me in fur.
You're the director.
I said "lascivious."
Now you go to the desk.
Become the character.
Write in his diary.
- Really write.
- I'm doing it.
But out loud, we are in the theater!
If not, how do we know who he is?
We are at the beginning of the play.
The scene is illuminated little by little...
We hear the ticking of a grandfather clock.
Tic tac...
.. tick...
.. tick...
.. tic tac!
October 22, 1870.
Two in the morning.
Living in a spa...
.. surrounded by forests and mountains.
It's a moonless night,
darkness and silence reign.
(VANDA WHISTLING)
A Moment! I hear a sparrow.
- A nightingale.
- A nightingale.
VANDA MEOWS
And the cry of a cat in heat.
I feel terribly alone...
.. unhappy, unfulfilled.
(In German) Good evening Sir.
Well, the Germans have invaded again?
 I hope I did not disturb you.
Absolutely not.
Hail, Aphrodite.
- So now you have not forgotten me?
- Forget?
My most dear old enemy?
- You're too kind.
- Yes
I do not have a right to a little kiss?
- That's better, but Thomas...
- Oh! - I told Thomas? Oops!
It's so cold in here!
Every time I come to visit you,
I am cold.
(SNEEZES) See?
I already catching a cold.
If you dodidn't pass the time
walking around naked...
However, I am Venus,
I have to be naked.
It is part of the job.
Do not you want to take off those rough clothes
and come here and hold me close to you?
There is so much room here under my fur.
No, thank you.
I brought this vision to you,
directly from Olympus.
It is divine!
- Do you not see the label?
Made in Olympus.  
Why should I care about your vision?
I know your small flaw.
You're not interested in women.
You just like their fur,
should marry an otter.
I understand it better with an otter
than with a woman.
But if I spread legs under my mink...
.. would you refuse a little love?
 Is it t 'a little' love you suggest?
No, it is the power that interests you.
- Dare you resist me?
- Yes, I dare.
Séférin, I want you on the ground,
at my feet.
- Beg me.
- Never.
You already belong to me and I will belong
until the end of time.
- Never.
- (In German) Goodbye my friend.
I'll be back.
And then, poof, she disappears.
 Whew!
- Not bad, eh?
- Not bad?... - You could 
write it down and put it in a play.
That's a good idea.
- In this context... - her accent 
could be like Marlene Dietrich.
Yes, that would work very well.
This gives a different picture of Kushemski.
Yes, in the middle of the night there is
a vision of Venus...
.. and then the next morning with Vanda:
"I saw her, I beg you."
We conclude by
lowering the lights...
.. and then when you get up in the morning again comes
knock, knock...
.. and then Venus reappears
disguised as Vanda.
- To take revenge.
- But yes, it's great!
 So are you?
- What?
 Are you he?
Kushemski - Novacek,
Novacek - Kushemski.
- No, not me.  
You said that there is a lot of you in there.
Then maybe you are Vanda?
- The play has nothing to do with me.
- Sure, you're just the author.
Oops, the adapter.
Type: "If a critic says that
that's me, kill him."
- I have the right to invent characters. 
- Of course adapter Novacek.
Just by chance you came across in the characters in a novel
about sadomasochism.
No, it's a famous book and I...
Didn't you experience this "unpredictable moment"
at the age of twelve?
- No.
- ln the library...
- No!
- With a cat.
No.
She's still waiting for your "big moment"?
It's not a damn bit like that!
I find the relationship between the two characters
both fascinating and complex. Very rich.
- Of course! 
- I love the emotional depth of the characters.
Don't you see more of
this kind of thing nowadays.
Don't you see more of this kind
rage nowadays.
- I should submit it some friends of mine.
- Okay.
Very well, then I don't understand
anything about anything.
When you return home, your fiancee doesn't
tie you to the bed and whip you?
No.
You should ask her and see if your fiancee will do it.
- Stop calling her "fiancee."
- Excuse me.
Should I call her your better half?
- I don't like that very much. 
- Would you tell me if you were afraid?
This is not about us.
Let me guess about your...
Marie-Cécile.
Marie-Cécile. I bet she's younger than you.
Good deduction.
Definitely grew up in a nice little house
a good family in Provence.
- I bet from La Baule.
- Nantes, actually.
But I bet her family
spent the weekend in La Baule...
.. in a beautiful villa with a garden.
She goes sailing and loves seafood.
Yes, it's true.
She is tall, slightly authoritarian,
but without being disagreeable.
with wonderful hair...
.. Long legs and a nice pair of...
.. eyes.
A mind to be respected.
She went to preparatory school in Paris, of course
to Louis Le Grand.
Am I wrong?
 Henry IV, School of Economic Sciences
- And she has a doctorate?
- She is finishing her thesis in sociology.
- She has a dog?
Let's see... I would say a labrador.
It's called...
It has an unusual name that is a little 'intellectual.
- Bourdieu?
- Derrida.
You are not lacking in culture I see.
I bet that she's a blonde...
.. she likes a small seedy theater and has a Belgian cactus...
.. Not exactly the Comédie Française.
No, there is taste in her family.
Am I right?
Of course, I'm right. Good.
But she is an artist and you lost your head
over this Marie-Cécile...
.. and her sensitivity.
"You're perhaps the first man I have ever met...
.. who has a real sensitivity."
She loves books, the opera, the ballet
things like that.
In the evening, watch and talk about the Arts
last Goncourt...
.. and then fuck quietly.
Nothing is better than a quiet sex session
to relax.
But there's a voice that echoes in his head...
.. a voice that demands other things.
I do not know what it is but it echoes.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
In the meantime you are happy.
You truly, truly love her...
.. and spend a quiet life looking Arty...
.. and talking about the latest Goncourt.
You will have children who will live
just like you and then you will die.
Shall we continue to read?
Yes, let's continue.
 The meeting in the birch forest? 
- Okay.
Let's pretend that's the statue of Venus.
Hail, Aphrodite.
Hail, Aphrodite...
re-read the text quickly?
No, Séverin.
No, no, this is not good.
All these stories of bondage and domination...
You have corrupted me with all this talk.
I am convinced that she would feel pleasure to dominate a man.
- No.
- Maybe even to torture.
- No.
- Admit it.
Not for me.
- How can I make you see reason?
- To hell with reason!
Séverin, do you really not understand?
You will never be
safe in the hands of a woman...
.. whoever she is.
But this play is sexist.
I want to yell!
What is so sexist?
"You will never be safe
in the hands of a woman."
- But it's in the book...
- you can't change anything?
- The book is sexist.
- The book is not sexist.
- On the contrary, it is something...
- A classic of world literature.
- That's what you were about to say?
- Not exactly.
And this?
We do not have a certain Titian here, sweetheart.
- It's a nice BDSM porno.
- What the...?
This story is nothing more than a big cliche. 
- And why is it a chiche?
He is spanked and suddenly
he likes to be whipped?
- It's what happened to the author.
- And it happened to you? 
- No!
Then what?
For me it is a play about two people who are
united eternally.
their hearts are handcuffed to each other.
- Shackled in perversion.
- No, handcuffed in passion.
- Yes, but it's his passion!
- They have a chemistry...
.. it's the meeting of two people
lighting fire to the powder.
This is the struggle of the sexes, and classes.
Vanda is an innocent woman who runs into a pervert.
- But then you do not understand anything!
- Vanda says: "He has corrupted me!"
And what if if her thirst for domination
was asleep inside her?
Kushemski? If he was to awaken it?
And if she was simply a woman?
This text brochure looks like it was written by
an old Austrian misogynist.
He forces her to a game of power
and then blames her.
- That's not it.
- That's exactly it!
- How?
- Look at the end for example. 
- Yes?
Vanda tells the Greek to whip him...
Kushemski .. then leaves him there with his cock in hand...
.. and it would be her fault even though he was the one to want it?
No, I think that little Kushemski
has the hots for the Greek.
I wonder how you can be so bitchy at this point.
How can you interpret Vanda so well...
.. and then be bitchy at this point?
Stupid cocksucking actress!
What a cunt!
Shit!
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me?
 I'm sorry, I screwed up.
Yes, but what is said is said.
Let's say that the meaning of the play is
"beware of your desires."
Since you knock on this door...
here is the argument of the play...
.. you do not take the piss out of a goddess:
.. so to speak.
 So to speak.
What is the modern way of saying "so to speak"?
"asshole".
If you say so.
Luckily goddesses do not exist
otherwise we would be in deep shit.
Okay, you're right.
I accept everything you said.
Can we... can we continue?
Please Vanda.
You do not understand that you
will never be safe in the hands of a woman?
Whoever she is.
We are two adventurers, Vanda.
Let's explore the limits of human nature.
You're sick.
You have been poisoned by the countess and 
now suffer the effects.
- But she adores effects like me.
- No. ..
You like having complete power over me. 
- No.
Your desires are my orders.
I beg and crawl at your feet.
Do with me whatever you want.
You are a mad visionary, a fanatic.
Who is willing to do anything,
to realize his dream.
- But my dream is you.
- Get away from me, Séverin.
Before it is too late.
- Do you love me?
- I do not know.
Decide, do something
to be convinced.
- How? - 
Do what all lovers do.
- Let me suffer.
- This disgusts me.
And I hate to pretend.
I'm not the countess, your aunt.
I am myself.
Repeat the line, the challenge.
I'm not the countess, your aunt.
I am myself.
- Again, get angry!
- What do you want from me, Thomas?
I'm not your fucking aunt,
I am me! What do you want?
- I don't know!!
- This time it is no longer the play.
- I want a lot more.
- But you're not her.
I'm just a poor bitch who needs the work.
And I'm not your aunt, I am me.
Okay so?
Yeah, okay. Very well.
I can't do this part.
It's too hard.
Don't go, please. Vanda. Stay here.
Say "I beg you."
I beg you.
- You're bad.
- I'm completely in your power.
Liar, you are not in my power, 
I am in your hands.
You're supposed to be my slave
but it is you who dominates me.
- It's true isn't it?
- What?
You never stop saying that I have the power
but you've got it.
The more he submits the more he dominates.
It's complex, yes.
Here is the contract that we talked about.
It establishes that you agree to a test
of total submission.
You will be my slave.
Completely give up your own identity.
Your body, your soul,
your honor will all belong to me.
Forever.
Sign at the bottom.
Well?
I thought my commitment would be for a year.
- What? You are trying to dictate conditions to me?
- Can I re-read the contract?
Why? Maybe you don't trust me?
Sign.
Good.
From now on you will call me Madame...
.. and you will speak only when allow it.
You will serve me meals
and await my orders in the hallway.
In the morning you will dress me
and you will dress me in the evening.
Bring me my socks
and put on my shoes.
- I'll call you Thomas.
- But I'm Gregoir in the text.
I changed it. Henceforth, I will call you Thomas.
You will serve as my valet and bring my coat with my coat of arms.
And as a gentleman... 
- You have to keep your word.
Don't we have a signed a contract which states that you are my slave?
- But I'm not your slave, I'm your valet.
- The difference escapes me.
- Is it a game?
- This is what I am.
I'm Stubborn, strong-willed, greedy...
.. and when I start something,
I see it through to the end.
The more you resist, the more I persist.
But, deep down, your nature is noble.
What do you know about my nature
aside from what you think you know?
Please forgive me, I was despicable.
Give me your passport and your money.
- But ..
- give it to me!
Tomorrow we leave for Florence.
I will travel in first class, you in third.
- In third class?
- You will eat and sleep with the servants.
- What is it, Thomas? You have something to say?
- Where will this end?
End?
We havn't even started.
But Vanda, I...
She slaps him...
.. kisses him...
.. and caresses his cheek...
Did I hurt you, my dear?
Yes, you are deliciously evil.
Well.
What did you learn about the handsome Greek?
His name is Alexis, he is a count.
- He's beautiful, isn't he?
- Ah, he's fascinating.
Kushemski, you said you had a crush on the Greek.
I have to take a room next to his tonight.
I will allow Count Alexis to seduce me.
Ah, but Vanda...
What is it?
Am I not free to do what I please?
- You turns me on.
- Silence, dog!
Bring me a rod of birch wood.
He takes the branch to her...
Listen to this hiss?
This sound vibrates my nerves
like a tuning fork.
I have only one desire:
to hear you groan under the blows.
Feel Herr Doktor Kushemski what I crave...
.. crying like a little girl,
my heart leaps in my chest.
The air is hot.
What have you done? What have you done?
Bla bla bla bla bla bla!
How bla bla bla?
- No. What do you mean?
Vanda turns into evil witch.
Air glowing,
my nerves are a tuning fork...
Let's have lightning and drum rolls while we're at.
Tomas, I really, really love it so much.
I like it too, 
but this has already been seen and reviewed.
What do you mean?
The play is... my play!
It's a superb play
and no one will make me change my mind.
Damn!
You don't know anything...
I do not believe, I refuse
to demolish my work...
.. Whether you are in the play or not!
Go to hell.
Okay, it's you who decides.
She takes a knife and puts it to his throat.
God, how I hate you.
What are you doing? What's going on?
Do you think I don't understand your game?
Do you think you can use me, I could subdue...
I do not want anything of the kind,
I swear.
If you only knew how delicious this sensation is.
You know what?
I'll go to the Labour Court...
- I'd like to give you the part.
- Now you say this.
Will you put it in writing?
CELLPHONE RINGS
Wait, I'm sorry.
- Yes?
- Fuck you, Marie-Cécile!
No, I'm still here.
- I have things to finish.
- He's fucking me Marie-Cécile! 
He's buggering me on all fours on the stage. 
- Soon.
He fucks like a Labrador in heat!
Yes, soon.
You start eating without me, then I'll come. OK?
But it's leftovers?
Leg of lamb from yesterday?
I'll call you when I leave and then...
Later, yes.
Yeah, okay.
I don't know.
I'll be back when I get back, okay?
Fuck you. Ciao.
- Excuse me. -
There was no one on the line, right?
 What?
- You pretended.
- You pretended to talk to someone.
- I was talking with my sweetheart.
- Who is this guy?
- Who says it's a guy?
And why did you pretend?
 According to you?
I didn't like that I had to answer the phone.
Type  "female revenge"?
Or something like that?
 Something like this, yes.
Any other director I would have already jumped on him.
- I am not "any other director."
- Bullshit.
If you thought you could, you would have already done it.
Not true.
 Though I him I allowed?
How did you know all those things about Marie-Cecile?
 I met her at the gym.
- You saw her!
She seemed very nice and very beautiful. Really.
We were talking while we were changing in the locker room...
.. Series "talks between girls."
I told her I'm an actress...
.. But I also am a private detective, 
on the side.
And she told me about her boyfriend.
A very mysterious type, a writer.
She gave me a bit 'of money
to investigate you...
.. to find out who you are, if you
seriously love her, things like that.
I do prenuptial agreements...
I do research on criminal record and financial status.
I have to meet her later at a hotel...
.. and give her a full account.
She has a nice body, huh? Congratulations
You're amazing!
- When a man tells me that I sniff a trap. 
- Ah, touché.
- Marie-Cécile never showers at the gym.  
 - Ah, no?
Yet she was wet.
Let's finish?
Yes
 Put this on.
 Thomas, you made me wait.
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
I cleaned the silverware.
You really look stylish wearing your uniform.
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Turn around.
Oh yes. Definitely irresistible.
I might even forget that you are a valet.
- But something is missing.
- Where's this coming from? It's not on...
I'm improvising.
 Something's missing.
Yes, really chic!
The icing on the cake.
- You like it?
- It is very nice my lady.
I could almost fall in love with you when I see you with this collar.
"Almost fall in love"?
This means that you don't love me!
I get bored, I whine constantly.
Your Count? Is he?
You're in love with him?
He followed me to Florence!
He does not love you. He just wants you,
as he wanted a thousand others.
Insolent animal!
How dare you speak to me in that tone?
- Bring me my boots.
- Yes, ma'am.
Not there. In the bag... idiot.
Yes, ma'am.
From now on you will call me Mistress.
It is more degrading.
Yes, Mistress.
 Do you like my boots?
Yes, Mistress.
 Do you like them?
Yes, Mistress.
And my legs.
Yes, Mistress.
Tomorrow maybe I will tie you
to the fig tree that stands in the garden...
.. and sting you with my golden clasp.
Or I could attach you
naked to a plow...
.. and lash you.
Would you like this?
Yes, Mistress.
I am very pleased with you, Thomas.
I might even give you a piece of candy.
Will there be anything else?
Yes, one last thing.
Call your Marie-Cécile
tonight and tell her you are not coming home.
- I can't do that.
- Ah, no?
You can't?
No, I can't.
Don't lie to her.
 (Marie-Cécile) Hello?
- Yes, Marie-Cecile? It's me.
Tonight I cannot come home.
- Tonight I cannot come home.
- Do not explain why.
- No, I can not tell you why.
- Tell her goodbye.
Goodbye.
Hang up and turn off your cell phone.
Don't you feel great?
Colluding here the two of us together...
This place is so nice.
And also so quiet.
I do not know even where I am. 
- But think about it.
A new life ahead of you, of us.
There's just us.
We and your friend, the Count.
Stop bothering me by speaking about him.
Haven't I punished you enough?
here's the problem.
Just when I wanted to take you in my arms.
you were going to... really?
Come on.
Come here.
Take me in your arms.
You see?
For an hour I'll let you imagine you are free.
In the end you will understand that you are
what I want.
An animal.
An object.
An empty space to fill.
No, I will not allow it.
- I will not, I refuse.
- I beg your pardon?
- I wrote you a letter.
- A letter?
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps.
"The degradation is too much,
you have already become unbearable."
The degradation claiming you...
I can not recite this passage.
- I do not see that happening.
- How would it be?
Yet it is clear enough.
What should I do?
In your head as you see the scene?
But it is the time when...
What was the line?
- "I wrote you a letter."
- A letter...
A "Dear John" letter, perhaps?
- The degradation claiming you...
- Lay down a bit '.
The degradation claiming you,
you've already become unbearable?
You have to listen to her for days...
.. you have been afraid to show it.
So? Where is it?
Show me this masterpiece.
A little 'fun
would not make me sick.
That's great, Tom.
Are you strong.
You should do you Vanda.
No, no...
But yes!
You have to be Vanda.
You understand her character better than me, you created her...
.. you know her intimately.
- I do not know her lines.
- But of course you know them.
- Pay attention, Séverin.
- I do the best I can, Mistress.
But as usual your best is not up to par.
- Bring me my coat.
- Yes, Mistress.
Prepare a bottle of champagne and two cocktails.
The Count Alexis will arrive
at any moment.
- But mistress...
- If you don't like it, you can leave.
Far from my sight.
Your fur, Mistress.
You will marry the Count Alexis, Mistress?
I will not lie anymore, Séverin.
That man makes me shudder.
Great!
Wait!
Sit down.
It lives in my thoughts,
I can not drive it away.
It lives in my thoughts,
I can not drive it away.
- I'm suffering.
- You're magnificent.
- Still you love this suffering.
- Get up and come back a little later.
If you ask me to become your wife, I will say yes.
You are magical.
You know it's very jealous of you?
I told him everything about the two of us.
He probably has threatened to kill you.
In fact...
- The Count hit you?
 Yes
- You liked it?
 Yes, it was sublime.
More intense.
- Yes, and it was sublime.
- Even more intense.
- He slapped you in the face?
- Yes
 And it was sublime.
- Oh!
- I'll kill you, both of you.
I tear out your heart,
throw it to the dogs!
You are cursed!
- What curse?
 Yes, kill me Séverin!
I'm sick of this comedy.
What comedy?
But how can you love me?
I was terrible with you.
I have done everything to save you...
.. to heal,
to show you how much I love you.
All to no avail?
None.
It was just a game?
A play? And the contract?
Oh, the contract...
My little, sweet, silly...
Séverin,
I loved you from the first moment.
I could not tell you why. I am not who you think.
I am weak, and lost... 
don't you understand?
Not bad.
It is I who should be submissive.
I who should be whipped and tied up.
 I think I will tie you to the statue
with a pair of your socks.
 That's What you want, right?
- Yes, I beg you.
Do with me what you wish.
- Promise to never leave me.
- I'll never leave you, I swear.
Turn around.
The hands?
I've dreamed of this moment ever since I met you.
Louder, louder.
I humble myself.
Mortify, subdue me, I implore you.
Very well, Tom.
This should be really good.
This is great.
But you know what is the problem?
Whatever we say or do,
this piece is degrading.
It is an insult to women.
Your pornography.
- But what are you saying?
- A damsel in distress...
.. a poor defenseless
bitch who humbles herself before a man:
"Beat me, hurt me,
I'm just a woman."
Holy cow!
- Damn!
- Are these emotions too strong?
That's good.
"I don't see this kind of anger these days."
But Vanda...
Thank me.
Thank you.
Thanks to whom?
Thank you, Mistress.
You thought you could dupe the stupid starlet, huh?
- To use her to satisfy your sick inclinations?
- No.
Like Frankenstein build yourself a little female of your own?
- You believed you could use me to humiliate you? 
- No, Vanda.
I swear!
- Thank you, Mistress.
- Thank you, goddess.
Thank you... goddess.
