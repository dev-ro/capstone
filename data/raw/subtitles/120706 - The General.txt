Martin!
Tango One is down!
They got the General!
Don't you touch him!
Where were you this morning
when he needed you?
They killed him.
That's my da!
You did this!
Is he dead, is he?
Get off!
Unknown assailant.
Congratulations, sir.
They got the General.
This is no victory for us.
- Inspector Kenny...
- Stand back.
The IRA are claiming responsibility.
Have you any comment?
There's nothing to say
at this time.
Can you give us any information about
the circumstances of the death, sir?
Inspector, the press want to know
why was there no Garda in presence.
They're trying to suggest
we were in collusion with the IRA.
Hey, stop there!
- Run!
- They're after us.
- Run!
- They're after us.
- Hey, stop there!
- Come back here!
Oh, no!
- Martin, wait!
- Faster!
Jesus, look at the size
of that bleedir dog!
Pick on someone your own size!
They're only bleedir kids!
Get out, you scumbag!
Where did you get those?
Jesus, you're shamir me, Martin.
- I'll bring 'em back then, will I?
- Jesus, Martin.
Yeah, that's my boy.
Ma, look.
It's fresh, Frances.
I only nicked it half an hour ago.
You'll get caught one day, Martin.
Not me.
Got ya now, Cahill!
- Why did you bring Frances?
- She wanted to see you, Martin.
- She is your girlfriend.
- She's not!
You said you'd never get caught.
I promise you,
I never will again.
They're evicting us.
All of us.
Got six months to get out.
No. They can't do that, Frances.
We won't leave Hollyfield.
- No way do we go.
- They've got us a flat in Kevin Street.
Kevin Street? That's a deliberate
insult to a criminal.
Them flats is right opposite
the cop shop.
They're nice flats, though.
What's nice? Neighbors
that'll cover for you. That's nice.
Look, Frances, we're the dregs.
We're the lowest of the low.
That's why we stick together.
That's why we belong in Hollyfield.
It's us against them.
Yeah. Four kids
in one little room.
Yeah, but happy.
Arert our kids happy?
Werert we happy there as kids?
Werert we?
No. I won't go.
I'll drag them through the courts.
As your lawyer, Martin,
I have to advise you against it.
It will be expensive,
and you'II lose in the end.
I don't care what it costs.
I pay you, don't I?
And I know you charge me twice
what you ask civilians.
Yeah, you rob me
without breakir into me house.
You break in
through the freakir letter box.
Come on, you lot.
- What's your name?
- Martin Cahill.
Get in there.
I haven't got all day. Go on.
Okay, you're free to go.
Keep your hands off me!
Come here.
- How are you, Tina?
- How are you?
Don't worry, Orla. Your da's here.
We're goir nowhere. Don't worry.
- They better not touch our stuff.
- They haven't.
The children will be better off.
Lovely park, schools, everything.
Hey, Kenny, you fat slob!
I see you! Get him!
Kenny, you're behind this!
We'll deal with you!
You're a big man now
with your men behind you.
- I'll have you anytime, Noel Curley!
- Get off!
You dirt bag.
Martin, you mad devil, ya.
Don't lose the rag, Martin.
Don't give him the satisfaction.
Oh, they let you out, did they?
Nice to get out
of this sewage and filth.
Young man, here's a 20p.
Get away from my kids.
Come here.
You're a clever fellow.
You're not like these thugs. You're
clever, and there's a responsibility.
You don't want your children
to grow up with your troubles.
You can get out of this cesspit,
get a job...
leave this behind.
Think I could get a job
in the police?
Throwir women and children
out on the street.
Throwir people out of their homes.
I'd love that.
Wreckir the family kip. And you
better not touch any of my stuff.
And you're not gettir me out of here,
neither. My appeal is pending.
Come on, Frances.
Let's go home.
The law's on my side.
You happy in the gutter?
Stay there, then.
Stay in the gutter.
Martin, you can't stay here.
Please!
Look, I'm beggir you,
on me hands and knees.
I can't, Frances.
I got me principles.
Principles!
You're lovir it.
Selfish thing, you.
Me sister's too good for you.
Get lost!
What can I do for you gents?
On the failure of your appeal,
I have to inform you, Mr. Cahill...
unless you vacate this site
within 48 hours...
you will be forcibly removed.
Well, let me inform you
that I'm havir you lot...
before the European Court
of Human Rights.
You dumped us here
when it suited you.
Now you want to sling us out
when you feel like it.
I know the hardship
suffered in this parish.
Push off, the lot of you.
You are all oppressors of the poor.
Civil freakir servants.
Garda freakir Sichona.
Who are these Parish priests?
Get out of me house.
Why do you always come in the mornings?
Don't you know I'm a night worker?
I'm the chairman
of the Housing Committee.
I've come myself to ask you
to back down quietly...
so we can start building
much needed houses on this site.
Well, I won't go to Kevin Street.
I told you that already.
I'll tell you what.
Give us a flat in Rathmines...
and I'll fold me tent.
Well, wouldn't you sooner live
closer to your own kind?
No, I'd sooner live
closer to me work.
All the big houses.
I'm only jokir.
- Where's my football?
- Why can't I ask Da for a new bike?
Because you can't.
You want a new one every week.
- The one you have is fine.
- No, there's two holes in it.
Unless you did it, there isn't any.
I looked at it the other day.
- There is.
- I told you not to leave it out.
- Do you want some tea?
- No, I'll eat out.
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. See ya.
Anybody want anything?
Well, you know Orla's
mad for a train set.
- Train set.
- Put it away.
Was that you, Orla?
If you spent less time
nagging about your schoolbag...
you might get
some of this food in you.
It's your own fault. You're supposed
to put it away every time.
Two holes! There is not,
unless you left it somewhere.
Just use the one you have until...
Just use the one you have until...
Look, if I buy a house,
the tax people will get me.
And welfare will stop
me dole money.
You could put it in Tina's name.
We could go there with the kids,
and she can stay here.
She needs her own place.
- Is that what you want, Tina?
- It'll be the same, won't it?
You'll come over here when
you want to get away from the kids...
and I'll help Frances there.
And you can have your own pigeon loft,
like you always wanted.
How much do they want?
Eighty grand.
It's a beautiful house, though.
I'll go around me hidir place tomorrow
and see what I can scrape up.
Oh, Martin, thanks a million.
You're great.
There's only one thing.
- What?
- They won't take cash.
Jesus. What's wrong
with this country?
Do they not trust
paper money anymore?
Everything's fake today.
Look at this.
Gold record?
- Hello. How are you?
- Can I get a banker's draft here?
Yes, indeed. How much
would you like it for?
Eighty grand.
- Eighty thousand?
- Yeah.
Good day at the races.
- Now, there you go.
- Is that it?
Yes, it is.
Thank you. Good-bye.
It's terrible how they make you wait
for your own money, isn't it?
I'd like to see Sergeant Kenny.
- Inspector.
- Oh, promotion.
- Name?
- Martin Cahill.
Excuse me, missus.
How's it goir, love?
We'd like to make a withdrawal.
That looks about 80 grand.
What do you want, Martin?
Come to confess a few crimes?
Just want to welcome you
back to the neighborhood, Inspector.
It's nice and peaceful now,
isn't it?
You know why they
sent me here, don't you?
- Not because of me, I hope.
- Yes, because of you.
Because they think I know
your wiles and your ways.
And I do.
It can only end one way, Martin,
if you keep on like this.
I know.
- Move! Out of the way!
- Oh, my God!
I'm a poor fellow.
I haven't much.
Debts up to here.
But I can sleep at night.
I've seen you outside me flat
there a few times.
No, you should drop in
the next time you're passir.
Have a little jar.
Bank robbery, across the street!
- Come on! The Celtic Bank!
- Come on! Hurry up!
Disgraceful the profits
these banks are makir.
You've made a right patsy
out of me, haven't you?
Congratulations.
Isn't it gorgeous?
It's great, Da.
- You're happy, huh?
- Go out and play in the back.
Oh, I love it.
You'll be playir golf next,
I suppose.
Now, don't be stupid, Martin.
It's still us against them.
Better get some curtains up.
What's gonna happen to the flat
when she gets a bloke?
She says, where'll she find one
as good as you?
Yeah, well.
Get your hands up!
Come on!
Let's go! Hurry up!
Come on! Pick it up!
Let's go!
Go!
Tell all mobiles keep a distance.
These men are armed, and we're not.
Suspects are armed.
Keep your distance.
Message received.
Suspects heading for Charleville Place.
We get a car to block them off
at Charleville Place.
- Throw the bag on the road!
- Why?
- Just do it!
- All right.
Jesus, sweet Jesus!
- Come on.
- We lost 'em.
- Dump the gear.
- Right. Let's go!
Jesus!
I don't even know the place.
I was only walkir down the street.
- You better sort it out.
- All right.
My client informs me that he was walking
quietly along the street...
when he was brutally assaulted
by Garda.
You have no witness
to connect him to this crime...
and I must insist
you release him immediately.
Well, you've had your reasonable access,
and we have the evidence.
Door!
Feeling better now, Martin?
Remember the slight collision
in the arcade?
Get that stuff!
When you scraped the helmet.
Careless.
Amateur.
We have the weapons.
We have the money.
We have the bike.
Armed robbery.
You're lookir at 12 years.
And for what?
For pennies.
When I'm inside, I'll have to admit
I was sent down for stealir 10p
coins.
- It's humiliatir.
- Too true.
You're a creeper.
It's in your nature.
You'II always be a bleedir creeper.
Give up out of that, will you?
Lt'll always be me hobby.
But I want somethir big.
Humiliate them.
Besides, I've got a family to support.
So has Noel.
If we go down for 12,
it's gonna take a lot of money.
Here's what we're gonna do.
- We're gonna take O'Connor's.
- O'Connor's the jeweler?
Two million in gold and jewels,
waitir for us.
Doesrt matter to me.
I'm goir down with you.
So gettir nicked for another job
makes no difference, but...
The IRA cased O'Connor's...
and even with their firepower...
they walked away from it.
The place is a fortified fortress.
You better believe it.
Get in here, will ya?
Who the hell is this?
- Why is he wearir that in here?
- Go lie down for a bit, please.
You don't need to know this bollix,
and he doesn't need to know you.
This gentleman works in O'Connor's.
- He's kindly offered to help us out.
- That's very nice of him.
Now, if word of this plan leaks out,
I'll know who done it and he'll
suffer.
You all know the rules.
This is the Penzance cock, isn't it?
He's won everything.
Yeah, he won five races
for me last year.
Still waitir for him
to bring home the trophy, though.
It's gonna be hard
to leave them all.
People in our profession
shouldn't have families.
Makes us soft.
No way. I'm not gonna let them
put me away again.
Not this time.
It'll be a hard rap to beat.
That woman can't identify us.
Not with the helmets on.
It's that forensics bollix.
What's his name?
Donovan. Clever boyo.
Get out!
I don't care if it is your birthday.
Get out of here with that cake.
Hey, I'm gonna get you.
Here, Martin, have a bite.
Go for it!
You're bad!
I beg the court's indulgence
in asking for an adjournment.
I'm assured that Dr. Donovan will
recover and is determined to testify.
The perpetrator
of this heinous crime...
will be hunted down
and brought to justice.
If this wicked person
happens to be in this court...
let me remind him that sentences
for perverting the course of justice...
are some of the severest
that this court can inflict.
- I don't want to talk to you.
- No, I don't want to talk to you.
- We know the type of bomb.
- I don't want to talk to you.
You got it from the paramilitaries,
probably a renegade.
The IRA won't like this.
They make their own inquiries.
You know what that means.
The next time your door is kicked in,
you'll be prayir it's the police.
I don't want to talk to you.
That's good, Martin.
You'll talk to him, then.
Right, Martin.
Let's talk your own language, then.
Get up!
Come on, get up!
I'll burn your house.
Higgins has a black dog.
You touch my dog,
and I will bloody kill ya.
- What have they done to you?
- You all right?
I'm passir blood.
Sound pad, yeah.
Now, this came from our man inside.
It's not good enough.
Willie, I want you to go to the alarms
company that fitted the system...
and rob the plans, all right?
Yeah. No worries.
- Is that the manager?
- 7:55?
- Yeah.
- On the dot.
They disarm the alarm between them.
Each of them has half of the code.
It's freezir.
- Next. Thank you.
- How are you?
And that's their weak spot?
Yeah, but look.
- How many?
- Just under a hundred.
That's a bit of a bollix.
Electrified.
All the windows are alarmed,
apart from them three at the top.
There he is! There's Cahill!
What do you know about the attempt
on Dr. Donovars life?
Show us your face.
Take off the balaclava.
- Take it off.
- Come on, Martin.
- Come on.
- Give us a look, Martin.
Now, that is an unwarranted
intrusion of that mars privacy.
- True.
- What's the problem?
- There they are!
- Over there!
This way, lads.
Before the adjournment...
several members of the jury complained
of being followed and watched.
For the remainder of this trial...
I order the jury to be sequestered
in a hotel...
under the armed protection
of the Garda.
Jeepers, I'm running out of ideas.
- Now, go again. Harry?
- I nick a car on the North Side.
- Shea?
- I take one in Terenure.
- When?
- 10:00.
- What kind of motor?
- Nothir flash, just reliable.
- You all right?
- No problem.
- Stuff fit ya?
- Like a glove.
- Got the van?
- Got it in me garage already.
- Tuned up.
- What are we wearir?
We're goir as a soccer team.
Track suits and trainers.
Burn them afterwards.
And?
Wear our own clothes under.
What's in the bags?
Cuttir equipment.
Hang on. Do you know
what's in the bags?
I know what's in the bags.
Well, what's the panic?
There's no need for panic.
- Any gun that's fired?
- Get rid of it.
Make sure your alibis
are rock solid.
And don't expect a woman to lie for you
if you're playir away from home.
That's me.
What about your alibi, Martin?
Just have to hope we can keep
the old case goir. We'll be in court.
- Will it be tomorrow?
- I'll let you know, Gary.
I want you to pull a little stroke
for me in court tomorrow.
Exhibit nine.
You will see that the analysis confirms
that the paint on the helmet...
is identical to that
on the metal grille in the arcade.
Martin Cahill's a murderer,
drug dealer and a dart board!
He deserves to be sent down
for life!
Order! Order in this court!
What's this about?
I never seen him before in me life.
It's gotta be a mistrial, hasn't
it?
Mr. Mackie,
I will not tolerate...
this kind of outrage.
I am as outraged as you,
Your Honor.
However, my client claims
no knowledge of this man.
And I must point out that
the accusations made just now...
could influence the jury
against my client...
and therefore I must ask you
to declare a mistrial.
Members of the jury,
this is a cynical ruse...
and I direct you to disregard
what was said.
Are you taking up study
of the law, Mr. Cahill?
Are you taking up study
of the law, Mr. Cahill?
See, I've been doir
a bit of reading tonight.
It seems that if you werert
in fear of your life...
when we took the money from you,
they can't deal me.
What? Oh, Jesus.
So if you say in court...
that you were
in fear of your life...
I'll have to make sure
that you are in fear of your life.
- Have you got that?
- Yeah.
- You sure?
- Yeah.
Yvonne, have you got
somebody with you?
Go back to sleep, Ma.
Good shot.
Somebody should fix that.
Pardon?
Somebody should fix that.
Me?
Whoa.
Right. Over. Up.
All right.
It's gonna be a long night.
Right. We're in.
Good luck, lads.
Opening gate.
Good morning, Mr. Smidtz.
- Not a bad day.
- Not bad, no.
Don't move, right?
Shut your mouth!
What's goir on?
Come on!
Jimmy, off you go.
What's up?
Just a problem with the alarms.
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
- You're new, aren't you?
- Yeah, me first day.
- Nice.
- Just my luck.
What's going on?
Something wrong with the alarms.
It's gonna be a couple of minutes.
- What did he say?
- What's goir on, lads?
- What's everybody out here for?
- Are we to stand out here all mornir?
Just a little delay.
It'II be fine. Don't worry about it.
- What was that?
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.
- It must be a test or something.
- There's something going on.
Is the shop open yet?
Looks good. Very good.
Looks very good.
I know we'll be inside
in a couple of minutes, okay?
Hurry your self up!
What's the problem here?
Hold it!
Don't come out.
What the hell is his problem?
What's the problem with the gate?
Shut up, all of ya!
Shut up!
- Look, it's no problem.
- I'll take a look for you.
It's an alarm thing, you know.
No, look. It's grand.
- It's beir sorted out.
- You sure?
It'll just take a couple of minutes.
No problem.
All right, sirs.
Take it easy. See you.
Right.
Now.
Out of the way!
Get out of the fuckir way!
- What's wrong?
- Get out of the way!
Here.
Divide it up.
Everyone gets the same.
You're the General.
You should get more than us.
I will. When you've peed it
against the wall...
or stuck it in your arm
or up your nose, I'll still have mine.
Left, right, left, right.
Me and Noel have to go. Stay here.
The bags'll be hidden safe later.
- All right?
- Where?
Better you don't know.
One of them's mine.
I've got a right to know.
You don't have a right to live
unless I say so.
- Where's the freakir helmets?
- Sorry, Martin.
Do you realize it's against the law
to ride a motorbike...
out on a public thoroughfare
without a freakir helmet?
Want to get me arrested?
In God's name.
What?
Wonder where all the press is today.
Down at O'Connor's, I suppose.
- You left the key in there.
- What bollix is gonna rob my bike?
- Come on. We're late.
- It's absolutely disgraceful.
Your Honor,
could we finish early today?
I have to draw me dole.
So, afraid for your life,
you handed over the money?
Objection.
Leading the witness.
- Sustained.
- I'll rephrase that.
With this gun
pointing at your head...
why did you give them the money?
- Well, wouldn't you?
- So, you were afraid you would be shot?
Not really.
I'm used to it.
It's happened a few times.
They never shoot.
But they would if you
did not give them the money?
I don't know.
I always give it to them.
But surely a terrifying experience.
Well, I wouldn't say that.
Your Honor...
I refer to section 23
of the Larceny Act of 1916.
If the state cannot show that
the victim was in fear of her life...
then the charge
cannot be sustained...
and I thereby call
for an acquittal.
Well done, men!
You beat them again!
You fellas should be out
catchir the big criminals...
instead of botherir
us little fellas.
We'll catch you yet, Cahill.
We'll take you down.
There's roughly 1,000 carats
in diamonds...
and 3,000 carats of sapphires...
rubies and sundries.
The whole lot's won'th
around ¡Ì1million.
I'II give you ¡Ì50,000 for the lot.
- 50,000?
- It's the best I can do.
No, it's not. We won't take
less than ten percent of its value.
- Oh, ten percent.
- It's the standard rate.
We won't haggle.
It's beneath us.
So, like, you know,
if you want to leave here alive...
Done.
Mr. Beavis has also
made an offer for your gold.
Twenty grand a man,
so it's up to yourselves.
To be delivered to me
in London, of course.
- So, are you pleased with it?
- Oh, yeah.
We thought it was a bit fancy
when we seen it goir up...
but she's state of the art,
all right.
You've got great height there,
you know. You need that.
Yeah. What's the story here?
She's got stamina.
She's brave.
That's pedigree there.
That's a winner.
What are you askir?
A lot of money, but you
can have her for what I paid.
I wouldn't take a profit.
Not from you.
How often do you take the ferry?
You know, with the pigeons.
Flyir them or buyir them.
Every couple of weeks, at least.
Sometimes I might go over
twice a week.
- Is she due?
- Yeah, any minute now.
- Where's the race from this week?
- Milton Keynes.
I don't know if it's a poet
or a place.
- Good luck, now.
- Yeah. See you.
Thanks.
I can't see it.
Where will it be comir from?
There. There he is.
He's comir in.
- Oh, there it is, yeah.
- My pigeons don't fly, they flutter.
Amazir, isn't it, they find their way
back from a place miles away?
Ah, Penzance, you little darlir.
Come here to me.
Hurry up, Da.
What's on the clock, Da?
- Thanks. See ya.
- No problem. Best of luck next week.
- Thanks. See ya.
- No problem. Best of luck next week.
- Yeah.
- Hi, Martin.
- How are you, Katherine?
- Is it okay if I get nappies off you?
- That's what they're there for.
- That's great. Thanks. See you later.
Havir a little party
at the creche with the kids.
- Tryir to raise some money.
- You're Mrs. Flannigan?
- Yeah.
- What's the eldest now?
- Seven now.
- Oh, Jesus! Seven.
- Tell Mick I was askir for him.
- I will. Thanks, Martin.
Good luck.
Half them fools are havir you on.
They're lyir.
It's my way of payir taxes,
you know.
Listen, I heard
about your brother Anthony.
- I'm sorry for your troubles.
- Died in jail.
Was it the wardens?
Brutality, was it?
No, it was the smack...
which you're fond of yourself, Jimmy.
You drug addicts
are always short of money.
I've got that under control.
Yeah. Johnny!
There you are.
You were a gold bar short
on your last run. Where'd you forget it?
Martin, I never would.
I swear
on me mother's life.
So, did it grow legs
and run away?
Honest.
Own up, and I'll leave you off
with a hidir.
Martin, please, no!
This isn't right.
There's some kind of mix-up.
I'm gonna nail down this problem
once and for all...
so it doesn't come back to haunt me.
Martin, I swear. I swear to God
I'd tell you if I knew.
You're a filthy liar.
Only for the pigeons, I wouldn't have
let you join in the first place.
Okay, listen, I might have pulled
a few strokes now and again...
just to feed me habit, you know,
but I wouldn't rip you off.
- Merciful God!
- You're going to know how he felt.
Talk.
I don't know.
Whew!
The bollix is innocent.
Nobody could take that much pain
without talkir.
Hello. This man here.
You came through with flying colors.
I'll see you never want.
You're my man, right?
All right?
- Hello!
- Take a seat. I'll be right with you.
Here, come on.
Hello, Doctor.
Excuse me, Doctor.
Hello, Doctor,
this man is very sick.
He's bleedir to death, ain't he?
See ya, Jimmy.
What have you done to yourself?
I was playir snooker.
We don't trust the IRA.
They're not proper criminals.
Just hear what they've got to say.
What do you want? Been up all night
dealir with one of me own men.
Yeah. The crucifixion.
Fair play. You've got your ear
close to the ground.
- Congratulations on the O'Connor job.
- Thanks very much, yeah.
It was too tough
for the IRA, I hear.
So, you're gettir
into drug dealir, huh?
Nah, not me.
I don't hold with it.
Some of your men
have been buyir up heroin.
Now they're flush with money.
It's for themselves, isn't it?
We all have our hobbies, you know.
I'm into pigeons myself.
Well, you let them know that the IRA
will be taking measures against
them.
Paddy, you could have sent me
a postcard, you know.
We want half the O'Connor haul.
If you want your own gold,
you get your own freakir gold.
- Rob your bleedir own, all right?
- Keep your voice down.
You pull your strokes,
and we'll pull ours.
Come here! You're not gettir
a penny, you dossers!
Go away! There's nothir as low
as robbir a robber!
Martin, just calm down.
There's no point aggravatir them.
What's the matter with you?
Walk away, why don't you?
I have a lot on me mind.
The IRA's on me back.
I hurted Jimmy
when I shouldn't have.
Half me men are drug addicts.
You're not like them.
You're a good man.
How many other men do you know
don't drink or smoke...
or hang around with other women?
Why don't you go around the flat
and see Tina?
We've had a chat about it,
me and her. I don't mind.
Keep it in the family, what?
I've been thinkir about it.
That's settled, then.
I don't know what
you're lookir so sad for.
What?
Yeah, he did.
And that.
Enough of that.
Tell Frances to come over here
instead of talkir behind me back.
Did you hear that, Frances?
They've taken Gary.
Lifted him off the street
in broad daylight.
- IRA?
- Yeah, for pushir drugs.
- Was he?
- No, not really.
Bit of dodging and weaving.
Personal, really.
Leave me bike.
But they're namir all of us,
even those who don't do drugs.
They're whippir the people up against
us. It's flamir mayhem out there.
Here, let me get me dole money,
and we'll see what can be done.
Right.
95 Anders Road.
Yeah, it's pandemonium.
You can hear them. Listen.
No, of course not.
Youse police are never here
when you are needed.
I'm a friend of Ned Kenny.
Get out, Curley,
you bleedir drug pusher!
We don't bleedir want you
around here!
There you are, poisonir
our bleedir kids. Out, out, out, out!
You're ruinir our kids
with your drugs.
We're throwing you out.
You people know me.
I'm not a pusher,
and I'm not a user.
Which one of you has ever
seen me sellir drugs, eh?
Come on!
Which one of you?
We know what you are,
Noel Curley.
A filthy crook
who'd stoop to anything.
You're out of here in two days.
Two days, do you hear?
Two days and you're out.
Gary says what they were really after
was where the O'Connor loot is
stashed.
This anti-drug campaign is all bollix.
It's just a smoke screen.
He said they threatened to nail
his hands to the front room floor.
Well, you know, imitation is
the sincerest form of flattery.
All right, boys.
All right.
Now listen, all of you.
Stay away from the drugs.
This is a battle of wits.
We have to let the people know
that we're not dealers or pushers.
The IRA think
they own the neighborhood.
They're trying to turn
our own people against us.
They're comir back
for Noel again tomorrow.
They're tryir to toss him
out of his own house.
We'll be waitir for them.
- Pushers out!
- When do we want it?
Now!
- What do we want?
- Pushers out!
- When do we want it?
- Now!
You know who the real pushers are.
Why don't you go after them...
instead of molesting
ordinary, decent criminals?
If you know who they are, why don't you
go after them if you're so concerned?
Get the hell away
from me house!
Get the hell away!
You all right?
Gee, you left that a bit late.
Timing.
Good. Right.
We get back down to business.
I've had an idea.
Do you know anything about art?
Art? No. Do you?
No, I don't know anything about art,
but I do know what I like...
to steal.
Apart from one other
owned by the Queen of England...
Apart from one other
owned by the Queen of England...
this is the only Vermeer
in private hands.
It would probably fetch in excess
of ¡Ì20 million on the open market.
Sir Alfred Beit has recently
announced his intention...
of gifting it
to the National Museum of Ireland.
If you'd like to follow me, please.
How would anyone get the kind
of money that would buy all this?
I don't know.
This Alfred Beit has a hole
in South Africa full of diamonds.
Pays blackies about ¡Ì2 a week
to dig them out for him.
I seen it on the telly.
He has them x-rayed on the way out
in case they swallow one.
What's she writir?
It's got to be a love letter.
It's a shoppir list. She's sending her
woman out for a package of corn flakes.
¡Ì5 each.
It's robbery.
Look at the knockers on that one.
See this?
Twenty million.
Twenty million for that bollix?
I can't see it.
Ah, it's class, Gary.
You wouldn't know anything
about that.
I'll tell you what is class, though.
The freakir security system.
Armed police here in ten.
I've got it worked out.
Now, that's
a good picture there.
See?
See the way the eyes follow you
around the room. Look.
That's a nice chandelier, isn't it?
All cars,
proceed fo Russborough House.
- Emergency alarms friggered.
- They're on their way.
We'll have a cup of tea.
There's sugar in that.
No sugar in that.
Come on, lads.
Check around the back.
Check out the grounds there.
Look for any signs
of forced entry.
You see anything out there?
Check all the windows.
We need more men on the grounds.
- It's all right over here.
- She's clear down this way.
- No, there's no sign of anything.
- They can find nothir taken.
Okay, sfand down. False alarm.
They're callir it
a false alarm.
- All clear, Sarge.
- Out of here.
Let's go. Come on.
All right. Slow down.
Here. Hang on.
Back up a bit. Come on.
You wrecked the front of that car.
What's your problem?
They're not our cars, are they?
All right. Shut up.
Get the paintings out.
Let's go.
Put those there.
Okay. Now, the rest of you,
away you go. Good luck, Gary.
Why?
Because if you don't know
where they are, if they go missir...
you won't get blamed.
- Who'd you say did that one?
- Reubens.
Where is it?
Are you sure you're going
to be able to find it again?
I've this one well marked.
Havert I been up here breakir me back
diggir it out?
Well, we didn't find any of that
fine silver you buried up here.
They won't notice the paintings are
missir till the mornir.
- This is my alibi. You go on home.
- Right.
What do you want this time, Cahill?
I'm makir a complaint.
Police brutality.
- I want to see Inspector Kenny.
- He won't be here till mornir.
- I'll wait.
- All night?
- Yeah.
- You pull another stroke?
- Garda, I need a lift home.
- Ah, Paddy.
- I'm not fit to drive.
- You're not fit to live, boy.
- Get out and leave me alone.
- Don't talk to me like that.
It's been a long night.
I'II slap the head off you. Get out.
- Mornir sir.
- Quiet night, Mick?
Just himself.
Did you sleep well, Martin?
I can sleep at night, you know?
I have to take my hat off to ya,
do I?
You're the General, is it?
Up there amongst the famous criminals
in the record book.
What? What do you mean?
Now you're an art connoisseur as well.
Do you think there's buyers out there
for that kind of stuff?
If anyone does come after it, you'll
never know if it's a sting or not.
- And maybe that'll be the end of you.
- Hang on. What did I do?
I been here all night.
I want to make a complaint.
Police harassment.
You're not welcome.
I hear O'Connor had to close down.
A hundred people lost their jobs...
ordinary, decent skins,
because of you.
Man of the people.
They can go on the dole,
like I have to.
Robin Hood, is it?
You scumbag.
I've been asking for a team
to keep you under 24-hour surveillance.
They wouldn't give me the funds.
Now, with this, they will.
We'll be all over you. You won't take
a leak without us knowing about it.
And now it's 7:45.
You got your alibi,
if that's what you came for.
I know what stroke it is
you're here to pull.
Get out.
Excuse me. How do you feel about
the police following you all the time?
There's no police following me.
I never see them.
I never see them.
Now, seriously, I don't notice them.
- No interest in the police.
- Do you deny you're Martin Cahill...
crime boss known as the General?
- There must be another Martin Cahill.
- Then who do you think the General is?
Some army officer.
Then why have the police circulated
notices about Martin Cahill...
known as the General,
wanted for armed robbery?
I think I do know.
There's an Inspector Ned Kenny.
He's always trying fo blacken me.
We made a complainf againsf him.
You look great on the telly, love.
My God, is that set adjusted right?
Makes me look fat.
You're not fat. Just cuddly.
Can't see your face, though.
I was covering up, wasrt I?
The hand over fhe face...
why is this?
Well, Defective Ned Kenny said
he was gonna puf someone somewhere...
fo identify me
for somefhir I didrf do.
So I've had fo do this
in public places ever since.
Why are you on the dole?
I didn't know Gary was in it.
Desperate, isn't it?
- You're awful.
- Good, isn't it?
Well, what's this about?
Have to take care of them paintings.
How can we? Them crawlir all over us.
My nerves are shot to bits.
Ignore them.
They can't keep it up.
They've 90 men following us.
We'll shake them off anyway.
- How are you, Mrs. Harney?
- What? In this?
Hey, Cahill.
Which sister did you screw last night?
- Both?
- Yours.
Three hundred miles up.
We've been drivir...
We've been drivir
for about six, seven hours.
Wort be long now.
How are ya, lads?
Fuckir getting fed up
with these sandwiches.
What's in them?
You know, banana, peanut butter
and jam... Elvis sandwiches.
He used to like them
pan fried though.
- Do you want one?
- No. Seen that sheep before. Look.
Does she know you?
Stalking ya, is she?
Barbara.
What's he doir?
He's got a spare can
of fuel.
- We're nearly out.
- Bollix.
- What are we gonna do?
- Call control.
They've run out.
Ready? Come on. Back up.
Sorry, lads.
We'd give you a lift, but we're not
goir anywhere near Harcourt Street.
How long do you think we got?
About 20 minutes at least
before they can get another car up here.
Right.
Somebody's whipped
the painting.
I wonder what fellow would do that.
That's mildew, Martin.
Ah, so it is.
Ah, there she is.
Still at the old writir.
Right.
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Stupid bleedir...
Easy, all right?
Probably wasrt that expensive,
that one.
I didn't like that picture.
Did you see what was on it?
I know.
What were you up to tonight, Cahill?
That was a clever old stunt
you pulled there all right, Martin.
Chalk that one up. But, by God,
when you fall, you will fall heavy.
You're a great sportsman, Higgins.
Arert you the golf champion?
Wasrt it you who fought for that
private golf course for the Garda?
No crooks allowed,
just crooked cops.
Well, you'll have no problem gettir
a hole in one in future.
You bastard!
Lousy bastard!
You rotten, conniving,
lousy bastard!
There will be a new level
of public cynicism...
There will be a new level
of public cynicism...
when if becomes known fhaf fhe noforious
Marfin Cahill has acquired...
an ¡Ì80,000 house...
as well as a Corporafion flaf
while every week drawing fhe dole.
Martin, they're every five minutes now.
We have to go.
Yeah, you're right.
Unless it is fhaf neifher properfy is
large enough on ifs own...
fo hang his collection of painting.
- I'll just get the bag, right?
- Perhaps he needs the fwo houses...
so fhaf he can gaze af his ease...
af his collecfion
of 17fh century Dufch Masfers.
He can't accuse me of that.
There's no evidence.
He can, Martin. They can say what they
like in the Dail and get away
with it.
Is that right?
Why don't I get elected?
I'd get the criminal vote.
Fifty percent of the country.
You can't.
You've got a criminal record.
- How do you know all this?
- School.
- You'd know if you'd ever gone.
- Martin, come on. Let's go.
There was a general welcome when fhe
Minisfer for Social Welfare announced...
Marfin Cahill's unemployment assistance
was being suspended...
pending an investigafion
info his financial situation.
- What?
- Come here.
Mary Harney urged the Revenue
commissioners fo gef involved.
She reminded fhe Dail fhat
Al Capone was jailed for tax evasion.
Let's go.
You all right?
Another little thief
comir into the world, Martin?
- How many little rats is that?
- Get off!
That's a pregnant woman!
Did you see your man O'Malley comir up
here all the way from the country...
givir out about us, huh?
With a head on him,
from stab city?
They went and got television.
- Was that all right, Martin?
- Well done, Nick. You better scarper.
Every whore in the land
wants to bother me. Follow me.
- Hold on tight.
- What?
- Bloody hell.
- Jesus.
Martin. Bloody hell.
Are you all right, Tina?
You prick.
You seen that, didn't you?
I want compensation, right?
I have a woman givir birth, and these
boorheads are bleedir harassing me!
She nearly gave birth in the road.
Whiplash... me neck is splattered.
Right. Holles Street, maternity ward.
- Put the siren on there, will ya?
- Cahill, you filthy crook.
Garda, what is going on here?
What is this?
- Garda, come back here.
- All right, Gary?
Look, we can't pull no strokes
with them watchir, Martin.
- They're tryir to starve us out.
- Treat it as a game.
Don't let them get to ya.
Go on in.
- Here ya go.
- Look.
Ain't she gorgeous?
That she is.
- Thanks. How are you? Great.
- What are you gonna call her?
Charlotte.
- Isn't she lovely?
- Who's the mother, Martin?
- Beautiful.
- Isn't she gorgeous?
You'll frighten her.
The heat's because of the paintings.
Why don't we just take
the 50 grand reward?
Maybe they'll let us
go back to normal.
Gridlock. Look.
- I had an offer.
- Is it kosher?
Let's find out.
Right, boys.
Here's the story.
There he is.
I'm off.
That can't be him.
There he is now.
Go on, follow him.
That one, after him. Go on.
Hey, there's another two.
- Which is which?
- I don't bloody know, do I?
Come in, Tango Three. Tango One is
outside 95 Anders Road. Over.
- All right?
- Get on.
Oh. Yeah.
All right. Go.
Them paintings have brought us bad luck,
Martin. We should get rid of them.
- I've had another offer.
- From who?
- The Ulster Volunteer Force.
- Oh, my, don't mess with them lads.
- Why not?
- They're loyalist, paramilitary...
butchering, murederir sorts,
that's why.
I don't give a fig about them,
or the IRA.
Anyway, it's the only
genuine offer I got.
All right, Johno?
See ya, all right?
Follow him.
The boys are back
with a warrant.
Better make them a cup of tea.
What?
This isn't my house.
Belongs to me sister-in-law.
She lets us stay here sometimes,
you know?
You have made other
quite substantial acquisitions...
that we would like
to talk to you about, Mr. Cahill.
- What?
- An expensive motorbike, for instance.
Ah, that was just
a good day at the races.
Would you excuse me a minute?
I've got a bowel problem.
It's probably nerves,
seeing you and all. Thanks.
- More tea?
- No, thanks.
Do they pay you extra
for home visits?
We do get mileage allowance, yeah.
- How much a mile?
- 75p a mile.
You must make a profit on that.
And, of course, you pay tax on it
if you do, I'm sure.
I was sittir on the toilet there
and it came to me.
Now, the whole of Ireland's
in crisis.
You know, with tax evasion,
drugs, vandalism.
I put it down to a lack of respect
for politicians...
civil servants,
people like that, you know?
That's not your car, I hope.
There, now. You see? That's exactly
what I'm talkir about. Bloody vandals.
Oh, Martin Cahill, you're mental!
What's the matter with you?
Martin!
- No. Stay.
- Is he all right?
- I hope so.
- They're all out to get me.
I never should have
bought this house.
You don't own things,
they own you.
- No, stay. You'll be all right.
- Just relax.
- We're not free like we were.
- Tommy, run down and get the doctor.
- You'll be all right, Martin.
- Quick!
What's wrong, Dad?
Yeah. You'll be all right.
You'll learn how much insulin you need,
night and morning...
depending on how active
you intend to be.
Diabetes is controllable...
if you're sensible.
- He'll be fine.
- Thanks, Doctor.
And I was the one that didn't
stick needles in himself, huh?
You beat the whole world,
your own body turns against you.
- It's a bollix.
- And no more cream cakes.
Noel's here.
Come in.
How you keepir, Martin?
Never better.
I want you to ride shotgun for me
when I meet these UVF fellows.
I can't.
- Are you nicked?
- No.
I confessed to the post office job.
I have to get away
from the strain of it.
To go inside for a few months,
you know?
Peace, recuperation.
I've lost me appetite for crime.
Noel.
You're all desertir me.
Shea and Jimmy were
caught last night.
They got careless.
They're up in court next week.
Better take these.
They're the keys to the garage.
Was there somethir else?
They shot Willie last night.
He was doir a stroke.
Just a supermarket.
He snuck out late.
Thought he'd slip the surveillance.
All he was lookir for
was food for his young ones.
If the supermarket had been open
he'd have paid with his own money.
They shot him dead
on the way out.
The Gardas have
more guns than us, Martin.
It's becoming decidedly hazardous
for us to ply our trade.
There's no one left.
There's plenty of young fellows.
They worship you. They'd die for you.
They're not Hollyfield.
The only ones I trust
are Hollyfield.
There's Gary.
Yeah, right.
There's Gary.
We had a good crack,
didn't we, as kids?
We're not freakir Italians.
Ah, Maeve.
Jesus, the size of you.
I suppose you hate people sayir
that to you. Do you?
Get them out of here, will you?
Yeah, right.
Martin, come on in.
To bed. Come on.
Quiet them down, will ya?
She minding them on her own
since the missus died?
It won't do her no harm.
The granny comes in during the day.
Have you still got
surveillance, Gary?
They gave up on me.
That a paintir, Martin?
Have you still got
that fold-away piece?
Yeah, under the floorboards.
- Get it, will you?
- Why?
Is this it?
If you don't mind me saying, Martin,
I don't like it.
Are you a Republican, Cahill?
Criminal. What are you?
Loyalists.
Oh, I'm into loyalty.
Loyalty to what?
- The Queen.
- Ah, great.
I identify with her.
Her ancestors tortured and murdered...
and grabbed every bleedir thing
they could.
And she doesn't pay any taxes.
She's my hero.
Ah, you're very sure of yourself.
Got cover, you know?
Is that it?
I'm displaying my wares.
"Bank van Ma..."
South African, is it?
It's where our weapons are coming from.
Your money's there...
once they authenticate the picture.
I trust you.
Why would you do that, Cahill?
Because if you let me down...
I'll tell the Queen on you.
Tango One just crept out
from under a stone.
You stupid thug.
You're creepy and you're crawly,
Cahill, you slimey slug.
Get up, Cahill, you filthy knacker.
Da. Is that you, Da?
There he is, Tommy.
What are you doir out, Dad?
It was a nice night, son.
Had a notion I might sleep outside.
It's bloody freezir.
You mind your language.
This is a respectable neighborhood.
Worse bleedir luck!
Are you out of your mind?
- It's a game.
- A game?
Thanks, son.
Gonna get some evidence, Da.
Turn the radio on, Martin.
This is the firsf of the Beif painfings
fo be recovered.
Three members of the ferrorisf group
fhe Ulsfer Volunfeer Force...
were arresfing in possession
of fhe painfing in a sting operation...
What are you doir?
Come on, son.
Gonna finish feedir them pigeons.
You're killir yourself
with your pride.
We've got you now, Cahill.
I didn't think even you
could sink so low.
Your own crowd will lynch you
when they hear...
you've been dealing
with the Protestant subversives.
Give me land, lofs of land
under sfarry skies above
Don't fence me in
Lef me ride in fhe wide open country
that I love
- Traitor!
- Dorf fence me in
Let me be by myself
in fhe evening breeze
You bum.
- Dorf fence me in
- Ya traitor!
- What's the problem?
- They coppers followed you?
I didn't have time to slip them,
you're that desperate. What is it?
What's the matter?
- I can't tell you with them watching.
- Calm down for a second.
- I can't.
- I can tell you what's bothering him.
He's been charged.
Rapir and assaultir
his 14-year-old daughter.
- They're tryir to break us, Martin.
- That's who you're holding, you poof.
Run, run, run!
Although Ulysses describes
every inch of Dublin...
Joyce himself fled to Paris...
escaping what he called "the daily spite
of this unmannered city."
To the right is the home of...
- You done it, didn't you?
- Look, Martin...
if I'd done that,
I'd sooner kill myself.
It was after that night
with the Proddys.
Me nerves was in pieces.
I got dead drunk.
I forgot me wife was dead.
I thought it was her.
I don't know
what I've done to Maeve.
You're a pervert.
Criminals don't molest kids.
Leave that to the priests, will you?
Look, Martin.
You've got to help me.
The Garda will beat
the living lights out of me.
You know what they're like
with perverts.
Get away from me.
I don't know what
I'm going to say, Martin.
I'd be in that much of a state.
Mrs. Duggan.
Save your breath
to cool your porridge, Martin Cahill.
I condemn him for what he done,
Mrs. Duggan.
As God is my judge, I curse him.
May he die roarir for a priest.
But don't turn that girl into a tout.
You're from Hollyfield.
We'll settle this ourselves.
Hollyfield people don't go to the cops.
It'd betray everything we stand for.
What? What do you stand for?
Thievir and killir
and scarir people to death.
Well, we don't live in Hollyfield now,
thanks be to God.
Think about what you're sayir,
Mrs. Duggan.
You don't scare me.
I lost me daughter, and I seen
this happen to me granddaughter.
Go on and kill me.
Geez, you'd be doir me a favor.
Hand washed.
We've a washer-dryer now.
Here's me offer.
I'll buy her a little house.
I'll give her 20 grand
to help her along.
She'll be under my protection.
And her uncles can give Gary
a hammerir.
Hi, Maeve.
Just come over
to give you a hand, you know?
Sorry for your troubles.
Your narll tell you about me offer.
Think about it, will you?
I know you don't want to be a tout.
Are you a worm, Cahill?
Why don't you use your front door?
Stay away from Mrs. Duggan, or we'll get
you on perverting the course of justice.
You could get 10 years for that.
We don't have to follow you anymore.
Your own kind are reporting on you.
Get off my wall.
You're trespassir.
It's a party wall,
and Mrs. Harney here is having a party.
She's invited us in.
Get those cops out of your place,
Mrs. Harney, or I'll burn them out.
I'm warnir ya.
If you want to live next door to me...
if you want to stay alive,
toss those whores out.
That's it, Cahill.
We're takir you in.
I like you, Martin.
God knows why, but there's nothir
I can do for you here.
Look at your situation.
Gary will talk,
I guarantee.
Those three UVF fellas, we'll make
them a deal to testify against you.
The IRA are not going to be too happy
about you helping Loyalists buy weapons.
Higgins is a child molester.
Where's me lawyer?
The muck is up to your neck
and rising.
Is it time to use
other means, Martin?
You know my method.
I'll have him, Pat.
That's it.
Right, sir.
Bye-bye, Higgins
Bye-bye, son
Bye-bye, Higgins
Here comes another one
How's your pigeons, Martin?
Listen to me, Martin.
You're in a deep, deep hole.
I'm gonna put you away.
I'm gonna stitch you up
for your own good.
Kenny's gonna frame me.
He's gonna plant something on me.
- Listen to me.
- Kenny the stitcher.
Can't you sense it, Martin?
It's all around.
Can't you feel it?
There's a bullet comir.
Kenny's a murderer!
He's gonna shoot me! Get me out!
Listen!
Why can't you just listen?
No, please!
Not any more! Please, don't.
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, don't hit me.
See, your problem is...
that you're doir stuff to me
that'd bother you.
But I'm not like you.
Water off a duck's back.
But I'll tell you what.
You're gettir to be like me.
Trespass, harassment,
intimidation...
beatir people up.
You've had to come down to my level.
That's right, Martin.
You brought me down with you.
I'm in the gutter as well.
You used to be a straight cop...
a good culshie boy from Kerry.
Always did what the priest told him,
knew right from wrong.
Now look at you.
The Church let you down, did it?
Nobody believes in nothir anymore...
except me.
Would it suit you, Martin...
if it was my bullet?
Sergeant Patrick Higgins, sir...
Sergeant Patrick Higgins, sir...
attached to Rathmines Garda station.
Sergeant, can you
identify the accused...
despite the silly disguise?
Yes, sir.
It's Martin Cahill.
And do you give an undertaking to desist
from threatening your neighbor?
I do.
And will you tell Inspector Kenny
to stop threatening me?
You're bound over to keep the peace.
Here he comes.
Take off that mask.
Come on, Martin.
Show yourself.
Ha! Show myself?
I'll bleedir show myself.
He's makir a right heel of you!
Just give me another month, sir.
He's cracking.
Cracking? Is he?
It's tomorrow, Martin.
She's gonna testify.
I think I lost 'em.
I seen your photograph
in the paper, Martin.
Tomorrow's the day, Martin.
She's determined to testify.
You were done by that parish priest
when you were an altar boy, werert you?
Yeah. He done all us lads.
That's gonna be your defense.
You say it screwed up your sex life.
Something like that.
Jesus.
I wouldn't like to grass on him.
He was a nice young fella.
It didn't hurt too much.
He enjoyed it.
- What?
- And he let us drink the altar wine.
Are you all right, Martin?
If we can just get it adjourned
for two or three months...
it'll give her time
to change her mind.
We've tried every avenue.
We'll stage a break-in.
Rough the place up.
Why?
I'll give you a flesh wound.
That'll do it.
- You think so?
- They'll have to delay it.
They'll have to.
What do you think?
- Good, isn't it?
- Yeah, Martin. It's good.
Mind if I have a drink
to dull the pain?
Martin.
That was my favorite mug!
Put your leg up there,
will you, Gary?
Martin, did you
have to smash my flippir kneecap?
Sorry, Gary.
Me aim has all gone to pots
since I got this "diabollix."
Still, it'll look more genuine.
Give us a couple of minutes before
you call the ambulance and the law.
Thanks, Martin.
Good luck.
What is it?
- What's wrong?
- Do your insulin.
Come on, what's wrong?
It was on the radio.
They found the paintings.
They couldn't have.
Only myself and Noel knew
where they were.
It's Noel.
He touted on me.
That's why he went inside.
He knew I'd find and kill him.
- He's a traitor.
- No, it was an accident.
- Everybody's rattir on me.
- No, they're not.
There was a fire in the garage next door
and the fire brigade had to
open it up.
- It was just bad luck.
- Do you believe that?
- They put that out to protect Noel.
- Noel wouldn't.
Where's Tina? I seen her
talking to a copper yesterday.
- I wasrt, Martin.
- You were. I seen ya.
He was only asking me
how the baby was.
- Yeah, that's how it starts.
- What are you on about?
Can I trust nobody now?
Ah, he's one of the best.
But he has to go to work now
fairly soon.
Orla, come here.
Come in.
Havert I told you not to play
with the neighbor's kids?
Don't worry, Da.
They won't play with us.
Why don't we go out tonight?
Just you and me and Tina, hm?
Go to a restaurant or somethir?
Show them they're
not gettir to us.
Go on.
Feed your pigeons.
- How's it hanging there, Martin?
- Any of them left alive?
Any chance of a bit of pigeon stew
there, Martin, huh?
That's a queer hairy looking pigeon
you've got there.
It's all right.
Penzance.
Stop.
I want you to smile.
Do you hear me?
We have to go out there in a minute.
They're gonna be watchir.
Better smile. You hear me?
Right.
What's black and brown
and looks good on a solicitor?
A rottweiler.
A bleedir rottweiler.
That's a good one now.
I was told that they were
two mighty good ferrets.
- Oh, this is lovely, isn't it?
- Mmm, that's nice.
Ah, gorgeous.
I'm stuffed.
Look at this.
Ah, Martin, your favorite.
Them days are gone forever.
Remember when you stole me
a cream cake?
What was I, ten?
I loved you then.
I love you still.
Good times.
Where was I?
Probably changir your nappy.
Us against them.
That's what you said.
Still is.
Martin, come here.
Look. They're gone.
You've beaten them.
They're gone.
