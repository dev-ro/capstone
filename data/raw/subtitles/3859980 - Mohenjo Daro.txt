At that time there was a clever coming to that place.
This girl ..
blessing of the mother Sindhu.
This is the beauty of Mohenjo daro.
The future of this town ..
in his hands.
A time will come

Surjan is a great leader for Mohenjo daro
Maham is a guard for the sale.
and he did a transaction with Sumerian secretly.
and he spoke at that time ..
Sindhu river when the water drain
and he will go to a place that contains gold.
With the sun shining.
and this does not happen everywhere.
I wish at this place.
we build dams so that the water could be stopped.
and we can pull out the gold from its place
dam.
so how the river will flow with water.
It was still flowing.
and for it.
we will dig the ground here so it opens a new way.
which will meet again here.
We should not be doing that.
Sindhu river is like a mother to us.
And if we stop the flow.
They will be angry.
and with the construction of dams create a new stream of water.
and water to be brave and drink from where we can get.
Sindhu river instead of a small river.
premises of a small dam, could not change the flow ..
but due to the gold.
all the foreign merchants who came to Harappa.
Next to Mohenjo Daro.
We will benefit greatly from them.
and make people here a huge advantage.
All the nice house, nice clothes.
Mohenjo Daro will be more powerful than Harappa.
Maham, by making a home in the air
You don't try to affect us here.
That supports me, please raise your hands to open.
and participating with Maham show your fist.

and then..
They began building a dam on the Indus River.
and the citizens support it.
All understanding of the consequences of Maham.
Maham make all sorts of ways to confront the insurgency.
and who do not follow the rules
and they will be killed
He met with robbers on the Kiardar hill 
For Maham but also to keep in the city.
The new track is made for the river.
And the water began to dry up and rocks in it shine.
and your father was still thinking about the dam problem.
Maham has betrayed us.
The dam was so strong that the water will dry up.
We must stop it.

Dams that you make will make the river flow changes direction

and manifests himself as a leader.
and he started to replace all trade regulations, taxes and others.
and all that was said by Surjan.

As a result of these dams throughout the region experienced a drought and no water.
and they began to leave their villages and come to Mohenjo Daro.
The city is developing 
Population increase.
