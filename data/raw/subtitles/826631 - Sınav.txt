Some of the events that have been
told in this movie hopefully have...
nothing to do with
actual people or institutions
Where the hell am I?
- In the exam.
- What exam?
What exam do you think?
The Student Selection Exam.
Which of the following is the right
indicator for a surgery to start?
Yes ... I am giving you the choices
What on earth is going on?
Who is this Hamurabi? Speak!
What do you think will happen
when you cannot pass this test?
They are going to get
you married to a man.
Who the hell is this man?
He came to ask for your hand.
What did you do professor?
You've cut the wrong vein.
What is this x issue?
X is the unknown,
sometimes also be y or z.
This could go up to three unknowns.
Aysel, are you match-making again?
Who are you working for?
Who could I be working for;
I am working for myself.
- Let go.
- Dad.
It's my fault that I trusted
you, and accepted this operation.
Stop spitting, there is an open
wound here. You'll be infected.
Shut up, you jackass. I'm
already out of anesthesia.
Who is going to suture me?
What do you mean? I
don't know how to do that.
What do you mean, I don't know!
I didn't study that part thinking there
wouldn't be any questions about it.
What are you doing dad?
You are now considered to be
one of the martyrs of the SSE.
It's God's will...
So you're nervous, heh?
System of education
would be very pleasan
handle, if we didn't have the schools
Age of Decline for the Ottoman
Empire General Minister of Education
This is the last week for applications
to the Student Selection Exam...
which has turned into a
nightmare for both the students...
and their parents.
Different from previous years,
students will now be responsible for
the subjects they were taught during
the last year of high school too.
The system renown for its
frequent changes has changed again.
The only thing that hasn't changed
is that what we learn in school
is not enough for us to be successful
in the Student Selection Exam
Are the kids supposed to determine
their future in 180 minutes again?
Does this mean that
life equals 180 minutes?
We have already extended
it for another 15 minutes.
Every year, we work really
hard to make system more fair.
We are not pushing him that much; we
just want him to be in a good school.
Do parents really know that it's very
difficult to achieve a good result?
It is cruel to expect the students
to get a result about their lives
and careers in just 195 minutes.
Parents, not knowing what to do,
enroll their children in so-called
preparatory courses.
We offer special services based on
the skills of our beloved kids...
I should also point out
that last year's winner...
attended our course.
Successful students are
already offered free courses.
Has there ever been a winner among
the students who have paid millions?
This is the most reliable and the
most fair system in this country.
The exam is on Sunday, June
18th. Good luck to everyone.
I'd like to know what you think
about this year's new exam system.
- Do you have some time?
- Isn't time what we all are short of?
Yes, as you can see, the excitement
of the exam has already...
surrounded the students.
Defne Deliormanli. Beykoz, Istanbul.
I had all sorts of
nightmares last night.
What kind of nightmare?
Dude, my dad had me
arrested by some men, okay?
- Good morning.
- Hey, don't laugh.
Come on dude, you should listen too.
He ordered that I be taken to the
station. Rafet was one of the men there.
He had me questioned about all
that I've learnt from my studies.
Dude, in my family, it's always
my dad who has the nightmares.
He is obsessed with some tribal issues.
When my mom passed away, my
grandpa wanted to take me to Urfa.
My dad didn't send me, insisting
that he'd educate me himself.
Now, he's stressed out worrying about
me not being able to pass the exam.
And how about my parents, man?
They don't even see a doctor thinking
I'll get into medical school anyway.
Hang in there dad. Next year, we'll
have a supporter in the hospital
You'll be the parents of
a doctor. Isn't that right?
Yeah, yeah! Last night, I
saw what a good doctor he is.
I passed away. I don't
want a doctor like him.
I woke up covered in sweat. Jackass.
Thanks to my dad, I am
like German made watches.
Every minute has been
planned and scheduled.
If they could, they wouldn't
even let me take a dump.
What the hell are we
going to do like this?
Where have you been girl?
You weren't here when I came.
How many times do I have to tell you
that you shouldn't call me "girl".
Obviously, Gamze had
some beautiful dreams
last night and she's not awake yet.
I've strived against
match-makers all night.
Professor Fatma came to ask for
my hand in marriage for her son.
I've sent my parents too with flowers
and chocolate. Didn't they come?
In your dreams...
The Principal's here.
Pull yourselves together.
He comes every morning.
Where did she come from?
Professor Candan is always with
him these days. What are they up to?
Well, she's a musician
and he is a psychopath.
And music heals the soul, right!
Candan is mine, don't even think
of saying anything bad about her.
It's so stuffy here. Have
you been smoking again?
Hey mom, give me a break.
Come on son, aren't you
getting up yet? It's 9 o'clock.
God damn it!
You stay up late at night, and
can't wake up in the morning.
I don't know how you will be
successful at school like this.
What school? I am late for work.
You said you'd work in the afternoons,
wouldn't fall behind in school.
Come on Mom! They'll give a good
bonus this month, if sales are good.
So I changed my shift to the morning.
There aren't any customers at night.
I don't like this at all.
Mom, it's just to make things better.
School is finished too, this summer.
You've been in high school
for 5 years, Mert. 5 years!
Mom, I need to earn money too.
Why are you talking like that?
There are many jobless graduates.
Look how my Guler is smiling!
Just trust in your son for once.
Take your keys. I won't
be home if you come early.
We're going to the
hospital with Aunt Ayten.
Are you going to tell
me something? Tell me?
There was a Hodja that you busted
with the TV crew the other day.
We arrested him, then
freed him. What happened?
When did you set him free?
Are you sorry? Was I
supposed to bring him home?
No, not home, but I was thinking, if
he is really good with sorcery stuff ...
we could take our son to him.
Neighbors say he might be possessed.
Possessed by who?
His studies are good, but when it
comes to exams, he can't do well.
He, somehow, gets nervous.
Come on! Stop pissing me off
early in morning! Genies, huh!
I'll possess him before genies do
and that'll teach him a lesson...
The bastard is not studying,
simply not studying!
Good morning Uncle Metin. You
aren't wearing your uniform today.
- Mr. Mert. You aren't either.
- There is no school today.
No school!? There's school
everyday, but you're not going.
We don't have a father like
yourself to take care of us.
Regards. Say hi to Sinan,
I'll be passing by tonight.
Yeah, don't be late you
crazy boy. Come on, Zeki.
They used to leave the seniors alone,
so that they could study for the exam.
Yeah dude. Last year, they
all had sick leave reports.
They didn't even come to school.
What are we supposed to study
for? SSE, or finishing the school?
Since it is a selection exam,
they should let us select too.
Who are you to select?
You are still a student.
Isn't our real issue the SSE?
We only have a few more
months until school is over.
I agree. From now on, we shouldn't
deal with school and tests.
We should concentrate on the
SSE and cheat at the tests.
Actually, we should find a way
to steal the test questions too.
What's going on?
What are you guys up to?
You should tell us too.
You mind your own business dude.
Don't "dude" me! And don't
mess up my mood. Okay?
And why are you guys always hanging
around together? Are you a gang?
Yes, we are. Any problem with that?
Hey, I don't want any trouble here.
You stay out of it Seyfo!
There won't be a gang out of these
guys, but you could be my medicine.
I'm crazy about you.
You're just my kind of girl.
I will take your kind and!
How are you talking with
your sister like that?
We all know how she's
interested in older guys.
We still haven't
forgotten about Mert but
his days are over. I am the king now.
My God. Let me go, he's
still calling me "girl". Offf!
I changed my shift to the
morning to make some extra money.
Good for you, what about school?
Don't talk to me about school. It
gives me the creeps thinking about it.
He's still talking about Mert?
He's giving me the creeps.
He's giving you the creeps
but if he were with us now...
he'd beat the crap out
of Turan and his gang.
Wouldn't it be good
if Mert were with us,
if we were to steal
the test questions?
You are good friends with him. Have
a chat with him and see what he says.
Hey man, if you think that he might
help us with stealing the papers...
you are totally wrong.
I can get them all by myself,
and without help from any of you.
Stealing the test questions?
I was kidding when I said that.
Congratulations dude, well
said. It's a brilliant idea.
Come on dude, you too?
And your dad is a cop...
What does that have to
do with it? This is life.
If the system screws
you up, you screw it too.
- Nice quote! Whose words are they?
- They are Levent Lemi's words, dude.
Do you even know
what his real name is?
I don't know.
"Armless Levo." Years ago, he used to
be a student in our school, alright?
One day he puts his arm in a cast
and comes to school like that.
Everyone feels sorry for him.
But he is enjoying himself.
He makes everyone sign his cast. Of
course, it's discovered later on...
that he was just fooling around.
He was writing down cheat notes on.
There're so many things written on the
cast that people don't
see the cheat notes
He was putting on another
cast for each test.
This is how he passed all
his subjects finished school.
Then, people started
calling him "Armless Levo."
What a cunning person! He was a jackal.
That's it guys! Look at him, he has
played the game by the rules, and...
what happened? Now he is where he
wanted to be, a respected businessman.
I don't want to be respected like that;
He fooled everyone. This is dishonesty.
They are actually fooling us.
They've been
filling our minds with multiplying...
dividing subjects, and predicates.
We are sleeping. Is this education?
Yeah, you are right. We should
have already decided on...
what we want to do in the future.
How can that be? If by chance
you don't know the date of the...
Mercidabik War in the SSE you
will not have a future or even a past.
Okay, when you think of it that way
You are right too, but
stealing and stuff is not right.
No dude, it's nothing like that.
I'll steal the questions from the
ones who steal my youth. No worries!
As you can see, we are following
the path of our idol, Levent.
Oh, sir!
Mr. Levent, right? Welcome,
sir! Welcome! We are honored.
I am the school principal, Rafet.
We've spoken on the phone before.
Oh please, don't. There's
no need to bend down.
Very well said; good advice.
It's our salaries that bent
us down. Please, go ahead sir.
Welcome to our school Mr. Levent. I'm
the guidance counselor, Zeynep Erez.
Thank you.
Mrs. Erez is our new
assistant principal.
She's a very innovative teacher.
All the Career Days events, and...
inviting you here was
her idea. Slowly! Good God!
Oh, Mr. Lemi right?
How nice to meet you!
I am the music teacher, Candan.
Are students still being taught how to
play the block flute in blocked lessons?
Nice joke!
Mr. Lemi, I am against the idea of
playing the flute as being complex.
I am trying to make the
kids love to play the violin.
Of course, in Yozgat, they used to
call the flute the shepherd's pipe.
Students being treated as sheep, how
could that be! It's just for the...
stationery stores to make money.
Sir, I also wish to
release an album...
and want to donate the entire
proceeds to our school.
Shall we talk about this?
We will. One minute. Can you please
show him around the school Mrs. Erez?
- Please, this way Mr. Levent.
- We are coming.
What are you doing?
You are all over him.
What does your old school look like?
There isn't much change. The building is
the same, the teachers are the same...
but it would be unfair to expect them to
change when the system doesn't change.
Were you able to change?
Your notoriety during your student
life is still being spoken about.
So, you heard it too.
A person doesn't change.
As I can understand my old notorious
days will never leave me alone.
That's why I was actually
hesitant about inviting you here.
I mean, I don't want to introduce my...
students to a man whose
past is full mistakes.
Since I am here now, what is
it that has changed your mind?
It would be unfair to them if I
didn't introduce them to a loyal and...
devoted graduate. Isn't that right?
Years ago, you used to be a student
like us in this school, and now...
you are giving scholarships to many
students, especially from our school.
Are you going to continue doing this?
Now, let me interpret what
our friend has just said.
We have intensive courses being offered
on the weekends for students to catch...
up for the student selection exam.
As you know, this is a bit costly
and expenditure is very high.
I guess what he's trying to say is
that will you be providing help...
for this problem.
Isn't that right, son?
Okay, but what do you mean by intensive?
Something that is accelerated.
On the weekends, we go over the things
that students haven't understood or...
couldn't cope with during
the lesson; very rapidly.
Interesting, but you have to be careful
about these intensive courses because...
they may get out of hand like
the high-speed trains of my country.
It would be a pity for these kids
if it one day runs off the rails.
- Alright, watch Rafet's face now.
- What are you going to ask him?
Yes, Sinan. Tell us! He is one
of our very successful students.
His father is a police officer. If
you ever have any kind of business...
with the police, please let me
know. Go ahead, son. Ask your question.
Professor, if you'd let me,
I'd like to ask you something.
Alumni of the school used
to call you "Armless Levo."
Is this in anyway true?
How could you be armless?
That's right. I had an accident. I had
to go around in a cast for some time
I was given that name by my
friends, during those days.
Little devils! Sit down, Sinan.
Your days with the cast went on for a
very long time because
the cheat notes...
written on the cast are still being
spoken about. You should know better.
You are taking it too far, son.
You asked
your question, what else do you want?
You are said be the biggest
cheat of this school.
Do you have anything to say for those
who would like to follow your path?
Kid, you follow that way
over there and get out.
I am really sorry. It's hard
to understand the youngsters.
Please, forgive these
inconsiderate students.
Oh come on, they are brilliant kids.
They are right too. I
finished school by cheating.
What do you mean? The cast
stuff... You must be joking.
No, I am not. The cast thing is true.
I wasn't only writing on it, but I
was also squeezing in some papers.
It's impossible. A reputable
businessman like you...
I will have to ask you not to
talk about this story anywhere.
Oh for God's sake, don't talk
about being reputable. Don't bother.
Besides, if the system
has screwed you up, you...
screw it up too. Do you
know how many defeats this...
system has gone through
while trying to defeat us?
That's right, sir. What happened?
Mr. Rafet, you have
to sign the papers.
Okay, I will.
Would you accompany him, Mrs. Erez?
Thanks a lot, Mrs. Erez.
I wish I weren't right with my
concerns about asking you to come here.
I can't really say that it's been
an ethical meeting with the students.
The audience will have to determine
whether the talk was an ethical one...
or not. I think you should think
about it in this way. Thank you!
Do you mean Crime and Punishment?
Yes. Besides we have 8 years of
elementary and 3 years of high school.
That makes 11 years.
Did you ever consider
why these kids are never being...
asked to read Dostoyevski
during those years?
So that they are not
awakened. Have a nice day!
I'm really sorry. Excuse me, can
you please open it for a second?
I'm really sorry. Driver, can you open
it for a second. I am really sorry.
I was about to say
something and was cut off.
As you'll remember, we were
talking about it from before hand.
We had some business with donations
scholarships, if you remember...
Mrs. Erez, leave this intensive
course nonsense to the side...
and build a proper library
with this check. Here you go.
I will pass it on to her.
Watch out for Rafet too. He might
fill the library with encyclopedias...
collected from newspapers.
You know where to find me.
You're always more than welcome.
Have a nice day, Mr. Rafet.
Have a nice day, sir. Regards!
God bless him! The library, okay?
Very good, congratulations.
He's such a great guy.
Did you see how he made
a fool out of Rafet?
Now you must have a talk with Mert.
How may I help you?
It's my wife's birthday today
and I've forgotten about it.
I wanted to take care of it during my
lunch break but couldn't find anything.
Actually, I think the blouse you're
holding in your hand is fabulous.
And is the color nice? Do
you think she'll like it?
I think brown is a perfect
color for a geography teacher.
Hey lad, I think you and
I will get along just fine.
For example, there was a
geography teacher in our school.
She always used to wear
dark colored clothes.
We used to think she was
a part of the map hanged.
In fact, there were some friends
who thought her boobs were like...
mountains.
My wife is a teacher.
Don't tell me she's
a geography teacher!
Such an inconsiderate person!
How was I supposed to know
she was a geography teacher?
She wasn't only a geography teacher,
but a geography teacher in our school.
How was I supposed to know that?
Are you serious? You have
the luck of a Bedouin.
Tell me about it. That was bad. I
received a warning from the shop too.
Now, she will always be on
my case at school too, right?
Do you even go to school? What
happened to your medical report?
It will be over on the 20th. I should
be looking around for a new one too.
Dude, forget about the new
report and get school over with.
Thanks brother. I will finish it.
Just wait, everything has a sequence.
Since you have left, nothing
has been the same; we are bored.
There are some new bullies that have
emerged and they are picking on us.
You should come back to
school so that we can relax.
Here come your friends. Hey guys!
Hello.
Where are you going? I
don't want to hold you up.
- We are going to study, as usual.
- The selection exam, right?
I've read something.
Have you heard about it?
This year, they will choose not by
looking at the outside but inside.
Whatever dude, may it be easy!
Thank you dude.
Come on, go and study.
I will see you...
when you guys get your
diploma. You diligent people!
Hello, Aunt Ayten, what's the matter?
What are you saying?
Your mother came here complaining
about the lumps on her neck and armpits.
We have diagnosed her with lymph
cancer as a result of tests that she has
undergone.
Since this typical kind of
cancer isn't easily detectable...
early diagnosis is really hard to
do. There's nothing to worry about.
We are not late for anything. She
will be getting better with the...
treatments that will
start right away. Believe me!
They called you in so
quickly and made worried.
How could I not be worried, mom?
You will be staying for another 2 days.
I'm not allowed to accompany you.
So, I brought some
underwear, towels and soap.
My dear son...
if you were to continue your
studies, could become a doctor too.
Come on, mom! How did
you come up with that now?
Look at where we are now.
We don't know what will
happen to us tomorrow.
If I could just see you going
to a university before I die.
Mom, what kind of talk is this...
Mom, please. Don't say things like
this. You are going to be fine.
We have gone through many
things together, and...
everything will be fine.
Dude, you look terrible!
Hey brother, I have to register
for the selection exam, right away.
- Who is it?
- It's Mert, dad.
- Good evening.
- Good evening.
I don't like my son being
friends with this crazy kid.
What's the matter? You never used to
interfere in these kinds of things.
My time has come to go and
do my military service duty.
They won't postpone it
anymore. I have to pass the exam
We'll take care of that, dude.
You're lucky, we have two more days.
I'd like to invite you in,
but you know my parents.
I know.
- I thought I was late for it.
- Not at all, dude. You just relax.
Thanks. I will call you.
Sinan, how am I supposed to get
ready? Do you think I can succeed?
Of course you will. Why shouldn't
you? Be here tomorrow morning at seven.
At seven? Why is that?
We'll have you in training camp.
It'll be a heavy duty training camp.
Alright, good.
Good morning, Zeki.
The long awaited miracle has come
true. Mert's coming back to school.
How did you convince him?
I didn't have to. They called
him for the military service.
If he can't finish high school and
pass selection exam, he'll be enlisted.
I congratulate the military service.
And why do we care if he's a deserter?
We've already talked about this.
- Hi guys.
- Welcome, bro.
Don't call me bro. We are now
considered to be on the same team.
I'll go and think over this 5 strangers
on the team business. Enjoy your work!
What work?
- Good morning, Uncle Metin.
- Good morning.
Can I borrow your lighter?
Perfect timing. Hey, we won't bring
the subject up right away. Okay?
We aren't going to mention
anything about cheating or stealing.
I know the guy. He'll start acting like
a brother and will start lecturing us.
First, we're going to go through
the method of giving him a hard time.
Great. We'll give him such a hard
time that he will understand what...
- we have been through.
- Wait a minute.
Where are we going?
The road that leads to success.
Really? So, is this the road to success?
We're the only ones walking this
road. Doesn't anyone know about it?
Exactly. See, these are your rivals.
Go and get your
application form right away.
Come on, dude. The line is
moving. It's been half an hour.
There are extra classes at
school on Saturday and Sunday.
We have to come to
school 5 days a week and
stay behind for extra lessons 3 times.
Besides this, you still have a lot
to catch up with from past years.
I've made a list of
books that you should buy.
Be sure to get them as soon as possible.
Preparation for Student Selection
Exam, The Exam Questions of the last...
10 years, Writing Guide,
Turkish Texts 1, Applied Math 2...
Dictionary of
Idioms. What's all this?
Perfect for a start. We should
get started in an easy mode.
Easy?
Yes. I got the Lotto
Papers. What do we do now?
Fill it out right away. We
don't have much time left.
Hold on a second.
Let's catch our breath.
You have a maximum of one
minute for each question.
Pay attention to the questions.
The choices are full of tricks.
Which of the options below is
not meant in this paragraph?
Which of the following
is not even there at all?
Be careful with negative
and reverse questions.
They will do their best to make us fail.
Bastards! I never knew there
were so many tricks involved.
I'm exhausted. Let's sit down
somewhere for a few minutes.
Unfortunately, there is no time rest.
Come on, dude. We'll also
have something to eat.
There are only 100
days left for the exam.
Do we even have time to eat?
If I have to calculate; we have 6 hours
of school everyday that makes 18 days.
We have 82 days left. If we take an hour
or an hour and a half lunch break...
that makes 9 days, 73 days left.
But hey, I thought we'd solve the
problem we've been dissolving ourselves.
What is this dude?
8 hours of courses on the weekends,
makes 5 days. We now have 68 days left.
We sleep for about 8 hours a day.
That makes 34. We're left with 34 days.
Extra lessons for 3 days a week 3 hours
each; adds up to 6 days. 28 days left.
We spend a lot of time on the road...
We also have to shower, go to the
bathroom, wash and iron clothes.
We should also count the homework
and these meetings too; 5-6 hours a...
day. We have 3 days left.
For your information, in 3 days,
he'll say, "Let's steal the questions."
You can't imagine how
happy you have made me.
So, I'll be able to see
you as a university student.
Of course you will
mother. Why shouldn't you?
Hey guys!
Hello man. You look great.
You look just like one of us.
Hey, you look really smart.
It's not enough to just
get dressed in a smart way.
Hi girl, you are back!
Dude, rule number one; we
will stop calling her "girl."
Really? Why is that? We used
to say it before, what happened?
Things have changed. Watch your mouth
if you don't want to mess up our mood.
What are you saying?
Dude, we barely convinced
him. Take it easy.
Okay, fine. I won't say
anything. We're blessed.
What's up with your hair? Tie it up.
Hey 3012 Mert.
Sir, I give up. I've forgotten
the way of the school, but...
you haven't forgotten my school number.
Do you really know all of our numbers?
Shut up, you ill-mannered
wretch. Sure I do.
This is 6024 Sinan, 5947
Kaan, 6813 Gamze, 5018 Uluc.
Fix your tie. Well done!
Let's hope for the best, sir.
You were a businessman; what
happened? What happened with your job?
I took a medical report,
sir. I'm on holiday.
We'd better go to our class, sir.
As you know, the bell has rung.
Really? Are you serious?
Oh, please do. Go ahead.
I shouldn't keep you longer. Students
who are willing to go to class!
This way, Mr. Kaan.
You'd better cut your hair. I don't
want to see it like this again.
Who could give us the multiples of this?
Yeah, take your time. Take the chalk.
But I didn't raise my hand Professor.
- Excuse me?
- I didn't raise my hand.
You'd better answer this question before
I divide you up by your multiples.
Come on kid, come on.
Sit down!
Hey listen; I have the
voice of a dramatic soprano.
I am now an alto and do you know why?
Because I've lost my
voice while making a demo.
But my album is being
delayed. How could this be?
Alright! Move it, move it. I beg you.
Dude, don't these teachers ever change?
Do they always choose the ones
who don't raise their hands?
That's their tactic.
In Professor Fatma's
class if you raise your
hand, you're safe.
Really? We'll see about that.
We're now doing geometry.
Is there anyone
remembers where we left off last time?
Actually I need to go to the bathroom.
Quiet! First, come to the
board, then you can go.
Take a piece of chalk from there.
I took the chalk.
Draw a trapezoid for me.
No way, Professor, I don't trap
people. I don't do things like that.
I said draw a shape, a trapezoid. Did I
ask for something else? Sit down, zero!
You, you are a dead man!
Hey you, the one with
the hood. Stop there.
Come here. Come here.
Take your hood off.
Take if off, take it off.
How wonderful! Very nice! It's
high time you have a makeover.
Yeah, it's high time.
From now until the day
you cut your hair...
I will be taking away some of
it in small bunches like this. Ok?
Now, have a great lesson. May
God help you through the lessons.
Again, a question from
2005 goes like this...
The engine of my car doesn't start.
So, I take it to a
mechanic to see what...
is wrong with it,
and he says nothing.
If p is, qpurely and simply...
If p is, qpurely and simply,
this man could be a dishonest guy.
The car has broken down.
Why is he saying,
"There's nothing wrong with the car?"
I'd personally not
propose him to anyone.
You've become such a malign person.
Forget about this proposition and go
check what it is that the girls want.
You're an impolite student who leads the
way and never stays behind. Sit down!
Mom, you shouldn't
have troubled yourself.
It was no trouble at all, my dear son.
My point of view in life had changed.
According to my birth certificate,
I was 20 but I had already lost...
my joy in life. Now I
can only dream of the days...
when I was filled
with joy and happiness.
My writing has received a
lot from my mother's illness.
Which of the following could be said for
the person mentioned in the paragraph?
He has become a different person because
of the things he's lived through.
Dude, he chose the
correct answer which was B.
He's actually answering the questions.
Hey man, how are your studies going?
Good. I am studying.
How many correct answers did
you get from Math and Science?
Around 67.
67? I was getting 82
just for Math and Science.
You should also answer the questions
on Social Science. How much did you get?
He can't even answer that question.
He's totally bad in Social Science.
But, if you ask him
about the top 10 he'd
answer instantly. He'll
become a pop star.
Look, both your brother and sister
have entered the best universities.
Kaan, if you tried a bit
harder, you could succeed too.
He's got no discipline.
How was life in Germany?
It was like a ticking clock.
You grew up
there too but this
rascal isn't like that.
Once he lifts his head away from the
books, he instantly
thinks of his guitar.
I can't control you all the time.
You have to want it yourself.
I agree dad, you are absolutely right.
I feel ashamed instead
of you. It's such a shame!
Is this behavior suitable for you?
Don't you want to attent to university.
Of course There are many universities
I can be registered at with my scores.
What do you mean? How are you going
to get into the Faculty of Medicine?
Stop pushing him. Maybe, he would
like to study something else.
Is that so?
Don't you remember fantasizing
when you were a kid?
You kept on saying you'd become a
doctor like Aunt Nesrin's cousin.
- Who's Aunt Nesrin's cousin, mom?
- Don't you know? What was it?
Mesut. Yeah, Mesut. He
graduated from medicine.
Dad, he didn't finish medical
school. The school finished him.
Don't you remember him looking
like this every time he came to us?
Now, he's calling him an ox.
Dad, have you ever asked me
what I really wanted to do?
How dare you talk to my dad like
that? Get up and go to your room.
You are acting as if these
people want the worst for you.
Did you see that?
I have just said one word
and he has spoiled my dinner.
I'm ashamed of you. You're vile!
I didn't do anything to
make anyone feel ashamed.
All animals are lions, in fact...
all people are animals,
isn't that right, sir?
Yes, it is. Then, if all living
things that are lions are animals...
animals that are living are lions.
Then, if p is to q or q is to r...
All lions are animals.
All tigers are lions.
The bottom line is that all living...
What's important is to be human.
Be a man! This is what you
should always try to learn.
Dear children, live life
as a way of documentary.
How much time do we have
till the break? Damn it!
Kaan. Come here.
He's going to give the questions again.
You take this and go to the
stationery across the street.
How many copies do you need?
Make 40 copies of it. Tell them
to charge it to Professor Rahmi.
I bet that he won't even open
it to check the questions.
What do you mean? The teacher gives him
questions and he never looks at them?
Do you know why I gave them?
So that he could photocopy them.
And, do you know why
I gave them to Kaan?
Because I trust him. If you
ever ask me how I know that...
because the animal didn't
even look at questions once.
Come in! Give them to
me. Go to your seat.
Did you ever check the questions?
Don't talk nonsense! Of course I didn't.
Are you crazy? And he says he didn't
check them with no shame at all.
Don't tell me, "Don't you feel ashamed?"
- What happened to you?
- I am answering, (e) gone crazy
You drove me crazy. It's enough,
enough. Did you get that? It's enough!
Don't shout. She's studying.
Did your daughter's success
just occur to you now?
I'll get her married to a man and it
will be over. Do you understand that?
You'll get her married, huh?
Whose daughter are you forcing to marry?
My daughter will finish her studies.
Then she'll marry the man she loves.
So, she'll marry the man she loves
and live a miserable life like I do?
I am going to divorce you!
Divorce me! Do as you wish!
I am going to divorce
you! I will divorce you.
That's enough! Stop bringing
my name up in your fights.
Get divorced as soon as possible.
Besides, after seeing you fight like...
this, I'll neither get
married nor fall in love.
God damn it!
Between parentheses, x equals 2x cube.
You should write too. Minus x equals...
Sinan? Is Gamze still angry with me?
Minus x
I don't know, dude.
She may have told you
some things, right?
You know that she's a tough one. We also
know the problems between her parents
Seeing her parents like that, she's
totally being drawn away from love.
We cant deny that she liked you too.
And you gave her hope.
Then you didn't even come to school.
So, she's angry...
Can't we just solve these
questions first, and then talk?
What about you guys? Look man.
My dad is calling.
Hello! I am at my friend's
house. We're studying together.
Of course not dad. Why should
I lie? Ok, dad. Right away.
My dad is really angry with
me. I have to get going now.
Before you go, you
were saying something?
I was wondering if they'd removed the
pool problems from the course outline.
You look beautiful.
Actually, if you leave
your hair loose...
and put on some make up,
you are a beautiful girl.
What's Ozgur doing? He's clinging on
to his lessons, studying like crazy.
Mert is failing. Do you know why
I'm saying that Mert's failing?
Because he's not studying.
I swear to God, I am
studying. You see me studying.
He's lying.
It's not enough to study, Mr. Mert.
We do. But having to
study for school and
selection exam both is very difficult.
What are we going to do then? We should
at least find a solution for the school.
I thought everything would be okay if
I came to school, but this is worse.
Actually, you know what? We should
just steal the test papers...
and get it over with.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything, dude.
This is it man! This is the first time
you have ever said something sensible.
So, are you suggesting that
we should steal the papers?
Are you crazy? Actually,
I've been meaning
to tell you this for a long time...
but I wasn't sure if I should or not.
I love it when you talk like this.
Why are you making us struggle?
You should have said
it from the beginning.
This is great. What are we going to do
about Turan and his gang?
They've been...
watching us closely
for a very long time.
Who? These guys?
Excuse me!
What are you looking
at? Give me that ball.
Come on, get out of here!
Yes, is there anything else?
Then we are all in, aren't we?
Why are you asking me,
dude? I am already in.
You were the ones who were waiting
for Mert. Her you go. He's here now.
You've been on my case since I came.
You're angry, so I am
not saying anything.
- Who are you to say anything anyway?
- Gamze, it's enough.
Look, it's more important for me than
anyone else here to finish school. Okay?
You won't understand this.
So, don't drag it out.
Let's get down to business
if the old issues are over.
Kaan, you are the only one who
could plan this whole thing.
Dude, I've never done anything
shameful in my whole life. Alright?
But my family is calling
me a "shameless man."
Okay, I was really angry the other day.
The questions that Professor
Rahmi gave me for photocopying...
- Did you look at them?
- Well, I did this time.
So, you were just
going to help yourself?
I couldn't say it,
okay? I couldn't say it.
Whatever, it doesn't matter.
Let's not talk about that now.
You are the only guy who's
organized systematic on the clock.
And we need you on this issue, okay?
Okay, but I'll only do the planning.
I won't interfere with the rest, deal?
Fine.
Are we going to rob Professor Fatma?
No way.
It's fine with me.
You're the ones who are having
difficulty in math, not me.
But it's the most problematic
one for all of us.
I think it's ideal for a start.
Sure, I think so too. She irritates
me anyway. Let's just start from there.
How are we going to do this?
She was telling us to draw a trapezoid.
Now, we'll make the best one.
Listen to me. We'll steal the
questions a day before the test.
Professor Fatma has a
bag with a code, right?
She keeps all her files and
grading books in that bag.
The day before the test, our
questions will be in that bag.
How are we going to find the password?
The code is with two digits. So,
there are 100 possible combinations.
It is really hard to guess.
But Kaan has an amazing idea...
When the day for stealing comes, we'll
arrange for Gamze to
be the guard on duty.
When Professor Fatma is in our
class, you'll make your move.
I can't. I get panic attacks.
You will not panic, sweetheart,
you will only attack.
Professor, there is an urgent phone
call for you that you have to take.
- Really? Who could it be?
- I don't know, professor.
I am coming right away.
Don't make any noise.
When Professor Fatma leaves the class,
I'll go next to the table and pretend
to be looking at the attendance sheet.
The bag will most probably be open...
I'll get the password
without anyone noticing.
- They have hung up the phone.
- I don't know professor.
Sure you don't. When one day
they come to ask for your hand...
how are you to start a family
and raise kids? So irresponsible!
How are we going to get
the questions from the bag?
I am answering. A) During lunch break.
Meaning, while there is no one in
the school or the teachers' room.
Kaan and I have been watching
her for the last few days.
She never goes out with that bag.
She always leaves it at school.
Meaning in the cupboard of her room.
Congratulations! Correct answer.
Every afternoon, her grandson comes
from school and she goes to meet him...
across the street. She stays there for
an hour and we can relax at that time.
Who is going to sneak
into the teachers' room?
It has to be someone
that no one would suspect.
Someone who nobody believes would
steal questions even if he were caught.
Someone that teachers trust enough
to hand him the questions themselves.
Because he's a trustworthy
and honest student.
No way! The fool you are calling
cannot reached at the moment.
I've made the plan. That's all from me.
I'm not interfering with the rest!
This is what we call virtue and ethics.
Before the lunch break, Kaan and
Sinan will hide in the boys' bathroom.
When the school is empty, Kaan
will go to the teachers' room.
Sinan will watch the stairs
from the end of the hall.
Gamze will already be on duty at the
gate. Whoever arrives early at school...
will call us and inform
us if they see any teachers.
What am I doing?
You're a civilian. You're going to
watch out for Professor Fatima outside.
If, for any reason, she returns
early to school, you'll let us know.
I'll be at my computer
at home, ensuring
that you can communicate
with each other.
You saved the best for yourself.
Sitting safely at a desk and at home.
Well, suit yourself.
It's okay. Don't be
absurd. This is a team game.
How are we going to
communicate with Uluc?
A) Since Mert will already
be out, he communicate easily.
He'll be on the phone the whole time.
B) Uluc's messenger will be on and
I'll communicate with him through...
a mobile device.
Uluc will be like a
telephone switchboard,
giving me news about all of you.
C) Gamze and I don't have
a phone with messenger.
How will we communicate? By farting?
Planning needs money, and we don't
have that much. What can we do?
No, that can't be.
If we're going to do this,
let's do it right.
I'll take care of the phone business.
Super! The operation will take
60 minutes. Good luck everyone.
Everything is okay. We can start.
Guys, it's your turn.
What's going on?
- Hello? Kaan?
- Where are you, man?
- I got cut off and can't connect.
- Great, and I can't get in.
What happened?
What do you mean by what
happened? Yours is here.
I am talking about Professor
Candan. She is here.
What's she up to? What's she doing?
I don't know. She's playing the violin.
Hold on, Mert is calling. Hello?
Hello, everything is fine here.
She got the boy from the bus.
- Good. Hold on a second.
- One minute. They aren't going home.
- Where are they going?
- How should I know? Wait a minute.
Hello? Sinan?
What are we going to do?
Shall we get out of here?
Candan is inside playing the violin.
One's here, the other's there.
Wait a little, just wait.
I don't know, do something. Follow them.
Follow them? I said they
got into the cab and left.
Good, okay.
Hello? Uluc? I am going to kill you.
We're going to follow that car.
What are we going to do now?
How the hell should I know?
Besides, why did you come here?
The line got cut and I freaked out.
What's up with the violin sound?
What's going on?
What could it be? We're
waiting. Gamze came here too.
The three of us are waiting.
What's Gamze doing there?
May God watch over you guys.
Did we buy those devices so the
three of could stand together?
I congratulate you guys.
Is this all you can do?
Ok, dude. Calm down a little.
Now, put your phones on silent
and wait until you hear from me.
We won't give up. We still
have time. We will keep waiting.
Uluc says we'll wait. Come on.
Hello? They arrived at a shopping
mall. I am following them...
Is everything alright with you guys?
Things are a little bit complicated
here, but you keep following her.
My dear Candan, it is such
an untimely devotion to music.
Here's your mobile number.
Now, I need an address
for a recording company.
Pick it up, pick it up.
Hello?
- Am I speaking with Professor Candan?
- Yes, speaking.
Professor, I am calling
from Bemol Records
: -This is Cevat
Ceyhan. - I am listening.
We are after talented musicians at
schools, especially after Candan...
- Ercetin's popularity.
- Yes.
And we have come across
your thing your name.
You are very kind, Mr.
Ceyhan. Of course, we can meet.
Is it necessary to meet today?
Well, right away if possible.
The studio is free at the moment.
We could do some recording...
My partners are here too. So,
we could sign a contract too.
Well, if you say today is
necessary. I am listening to you.
Then ... let me give you the address.
Okay, I am writing it down.
It's IMC Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek,
Bemol Records, Cevat Ceyhan.
Which bazaar did you say?
Ma'am, it's the IMC
Bazaar, opposite Zeyrek.
There aren't any mistakes
with the address, right?
Of course not. What kind
of a mistake can there be?
Alright, sir. So, that's your place.
Come on. We are waiting for you.
My accent always works
within the music sector.
Oh God, my voice is gone. God damn it.
Hello? Kaan? Take Sinan and
get out. Candan is coming out.
I can't believe this. What
was it? I can't believe it...
I have lost my voice too.
Try a little harder, Candan.
Hello? Candan just left.
Okay. Continue with the operation.
God damn it.
Is it okay? Did you get it?
Yeah, you wish. We are
screwed. It's a different bag.
What do you mean "a different bag"?
I'm saying that it's a different bag.
The old one had 2 digits and this has 3.
Why is she changing her
bag? Okay. Wait a second.
What is it?
They've finished. They're
leaving. How are things with you?
It's not good at all. Try and
delay her. I'm hanging up ...
How am I going to delay her? Hello?
Okay. We will add numbers to the
beginning and end of the old number.
Try all the combinations.
What's this? If it were a test, I
could skip the questions I can't answer.
Excuse me, ma'am. Can you
come down to the cashier?
Why? What happened?
This way, please. The alarm went off.
It's almost one o'clock. Where are you?
I tried. I tried them
all. None of them worked.
That's impossible. I am out
of here or we'll get caught.
No, wait. Try again by
putting them at the beginning.
Ma'am, there was a little
misunderstanding. Please forgive us.
There's no need to apologize.
Actually, I was kind of in a hurry.
You've wasted my time. Come
on, baby. Let's get out of here.
It's not working. None of it's working.
Come on Uluc, work your head.
What password would a mathematician use?
Guys, I'm giving you the password
of geometry. Pi, meaning 3.14.
I got it. Try
it first. 3-1-4.
Or
4-3-1.
Try them all.
This is it!
I couldn't delay her any longer.
She dropped off the grandson too.
We are almost at the street
of the school. What did you do?
We'll be done in 2 minutes.
We found the questions.
Come on, get out of there.
What are you still doing?
Questions for physics and
history. This is heaven!
Get out! You'll get caught.
Forget about history and physics.
What happened?
CSI Urfa operation has been
completed. Let's hope for the best.
This is it! This is what I call
killing three birds with one stone.
Oh, come on. That can't be. They
wouldn't dare do such a thing.
Don't you think I will be able
to understand from their answers?
This is the first time in my life
I've passed a math exam so easily.
As I said yesterday, you all
solved it in a different way, right?
If we all get a full mark, we
will mess the whole thing up.
How about you?
I've just looked it over.
That's enough for me.
What's up my young bull?
What? If things don't go well as
planned, have your immediate family...
and I have my tribe,
in Urfa, waiting for us.
Oh, get out of here. You
have Candan's phone number.
You're just kidding us
talking about tribes and all.
Why don't you go after women your own
age just like all the other people?
I'll say this knowing Gamze won't
be offended. Our generation sucks.
How do you know. Did you try?
I have a bachelor dad, that's how.
Talking about fathers, we have
been using your house like a cell...
I hope that we're not being disgraceful.
Not at all! I was talking
about something else, here.
There's food in the oven, Uluc.
You can warm it up and eat it.
Having a child means having
problems. But I still love him...
Candan is a totally different woman.
I know that the answer key of the
selection exam and a
treble clef don't...
mean the same thing to you guys, but
knowing about music
will make you think...
systematically and will
help you heal your soul.
Sometimes, I feel like
she's lecturing only me.
How did that happen? She
doesn't even know you exist.
Fine. That's what you think.
I have her number though.
I'll now take private
lessons from her.
What lessons?
Violin lessons.
Is your violin tuned up well?
Yes, but I first have to admit
something to you, professor.
Tell me. What is it, Uluc?
I am really bored with this violin.
Shall we just move on
to another instrument?
Another instrument?
Yes, professor. I don't
know. Something more popular.
For example, we have some
entertainment nights in Urfa.
Entertainment nights?
Haven't you ever heard of it?
For example, the Mici of Kahta...
or may God rest his
soul, the Boiler Bedih...
Yes, what do we do now?
- What do you mean by what do we do?
- Meaning, what's our new plan?
It's the fatal exam robbery, Chapter 2.
Are you doing this on
purpose? Speak in Turkish.
- That means we'll rob a bank.
- What bank?
The question bank. The test
exams for intensive courses.
Come on. Why are we stealing them?
It's just a test exam as we call it.
Because every week, their
results are being mailed home.
When our marks are low, our
parents at home start nagging.
I can't take that anymore.
Every time my mom receives a paper,
she tells me to get my dowry ready.
Is she nuts?
That's exactly what my father says,
and that's when the fighting starts.
Whatever, if everyone agrees, let's
sneak into the materials room and get
the answer keys for the rest of the
weeks, which will put an end to it.
What's the plan?
First the keys. Rafet has one of the
keys, and Seyfo has the other one.
Seyfo has one key chain
that has all the keys in it.
Gamze, Seyfo is a big admirer of yours.
What's up, Seyfo?
Hey, welcome Gamze.
I'm going to get some ice-cream.
I'm burning from inside...
I'll give you it. Which one do you want?
Don't bother. I'll get
it, but it's locked.
Can you throw me the keys, Seyfo?
You continue your work, Seyfo.
Hey Seyfo, are you ok?
Thank you. What's up?
Can you give me some water
or something? I am thirsty.
There's no water.
Drink from the fountain.
But the selling still continues.
Gamze is getting an ice-cream there.
What the hell is this? Are
you planning a robbery or what?
Of course not. It's the key
to the girls' locker room.
We'll just have some fun.
Help your brother a little bit.
You sneaky person...
Here are the answer keys. I've
made two copies, just in case.
When do we sneak in?
Tomorrow. On Career Day caricaturist
Yigit Ozgur will be here.
Everyone, including the headmaster,
will be in the conference hall.
We'll sneak into the room at that time.
To become a caricaturist, what major
am supposed to choose for the exam?
As far as I know, there is no
major like that in the universities.
If there were, I would have
been studying there now...
but if you must decide on a major
Hello? What's the situation like?
Be very careful because
Rafet is not around.
Okay. We are going down.
Okay. See you later.
Uluc said that Rafet isn't around.
If he comes out from
somewhere, we will be screwed.
Don't be scared. God knows
where he is or what he is after.
Besides, if you're not caught red
handed, you can't be considered guilty.
I said stop. Slow down a little bit.
I passed the last
exit before the bridge.
One minute. Weren't you supposed to
make an album for me with the extra...
money from the parent
teacher association?
Weren't you going to back
me up and be my producer?
I will. Did you ever see
me not backing you up?
I always back you up. Why do you think
I started with these intensive courses?
Ask me why?
I'm telling you I'll
make an album for you.
- Really?
- Of course, it's real.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Ooh, look who's here.
Yes, Mert. 3012 Mert. Rafet.
Actually, 69 Rafet.
What are we doing here?
We'll leave, professor.
Don't be ridiculous. Don't you see?
I've been thinking of giving
Rafet a nickname for a long time.
- 69 Rafet is super, professor.
- Give me that camera.
You take this camera and
get lost. Close the door too.
Photo... What are you
doing? Sinan... the camera...
What do you guys want?
What are you doing here?
Well, would you believe me if
I said we were just passing by?
What are you doing here?
We were just checking the inventory
here, and I felt hot in the jacket.
To do, you know, the
warehouse is stuffy.
We, Rafet and I, will be married
soon and build a happy house.
Isn't that right, Mr. Rafet?
Sure. The one who gives less...
We'll talk about that later.
I will prepare your house for
you with pictures that just left.
Excuse me, I'll be back soon.
Bro, I have some good news
for you and some bad news.
The bad news is that Rafet's here.
Good
news is that Professor
Candan's on his lap
What lap? Don't exaggerate guys.
Of course, we might say
that it's bad news for you.
What's she doing on his lap?
Mr. Rafet was giving her something
but we came in at that moment.
I thought I'd ask you about
what to do with these lovebirds.
There's nothing going on.
Decision made. She's dead for me
now. She's got no taste at all.
He's very depressed.
He's very angry... And his
grandfather is from the tribe...
What happened? What
do you want? Tell me.
All you have to do is give me the answer
keys of all the remaining test exams.
That's one... if this matter leaves this
room, I'll make sure the record you...
die for goes public. And that's two.
Have some water. Come on, son.
If anything goes wrong, I
know you and you know me.
- Don't get anyone else involved.
- Deal.
And stop bothering me about my hair.
We're
interfering with your personal life?
I'm closing it ... relax.
God knows what he'll start
thinking in his head now.
Hey, what happened?
- There is nothing wrong, man. Relax.
- Not that. What about the booklets?
I've solved that problem.
He'll send them home.
69 Rafet. It's super.
Come on, I will take care of this.
It was obvious that something
like this would happen.
I'm telling you, I'll take
care of it. Don't do this.
Oh, this is bad. Can you
please put yourjacket on?
Ok, I'm putting my jacket
on. Wait, I'll end this issue.
What's this guy's name? Mert!
Yes?
Hi, this is Zeynep Erez. I'm
Mert's new guidance counselor.
If you have some time,
can I have a word with you?
Don't feel sad dear. If he wants
to get divorced, then divorce him.
Don't say it like that
dear. It just hurts.
You keep struggling through the years.
Then a day comes and you find
yourself locked outside the door.
Thank you! Sorry for the trouble.
You know, Mert has been in school for a
long time and he still hasn't graduated.
Do you, or his father, ever
talk to him about this matter?
He doesn't have a
father. We're separated.
No matter how much you care, guys
are guys. Aren't they all the same?
One day, he just left us... Mert
was 11 years old when he left.
Didn't he ever call his son after that?
Never.
We started a life with
Mert. Just like a friend...
Look at Mrs. Guler, she's
never had a happy day.
Just when she brought her
son up, this is what happened.
Having a mother like you, why
did Mert turn out to be like this?
Mert isn't the child you think
he is. He just wanted to work.
He said the streets are filled with
unemployed people and wanted to start...
earning money as soon as possible.
Does he work?
Yes. But he's studying really
hard now, he's back in school.
He'll enter the selection exam too.
He doesn't want to hurt me anymore.
I think my illness
played a big role in that.
What did the doctors say?
I hope it's nothing serious?
The doctors have said
she'd be alright, but...
I have cancer.
This is cancer. It's not easy.
Look, it's more important for me than
anyone else here to finish school, OK?
All I want is to see him go
to a university before I die.
I've kept you busy with my problems.
You've come to talk about
something. Did Mert do something bad?
No! What could he have
done that's that bad?
I am sure that whatever he
is doing right now is for you.
As it seems, you are taking this
studying business really slowly.
You're going to make me break
that guitar and then relax.
- Are your lessons finished?
- Dad, I just wanted to take a break.
When did you study hard
enough to take a break already?
Will it be bad if you go and
solve a few more extra questions?
Dad, I did. I finished all
the tests of the previous year.
Even my dead father can do those
previous tests. Are you going to be...
able to do the tests of this year?
Do you see that? He doesn't even care.
The guitar in your hand doesn't even
look like one. We paid lots of money...
but it only has 4 strings.
Dad, it's a bass guitar. It's
supposed to have only 4 strings.
Look at him. Look! I am
talking about other things...
he's sitting there enjoying
himself. Look, look at this!
Alright then, so even enjoying
oneself is not allowed?
Yes, it's not allowed. It's
forbidden. I'm not allowing it.
Get up and study. As if I'm the one
who's going to get into a university.
- What's going on?
- Come here.
- Yes, dad. Is there something wrong?
- You shameless prick...
What are you doing
Metin? What's going on?
They called from school. Your
geography paper was the same as Mert's.
- Are you guys cheating?
- Of course not. What cheating?
Didn't I tell you to stop
seeing that crook called Mert?
Dad, we are studying together.
That may be why our papers look
the same. We're not cheating.
: I swear to God, I
will break your bones.
Are you going to be a dishonest man
with no dignity? You ruined my dignity!
It's enough! Enough! Enough!
Let go!
Go to your room.
Get out of my sight!
The best mother of all mothers.
Come on, it's medication time.
You have to take these on time
so that you can get better.
My beautiful mother.
Have your water too.
Once we get this exam over with,
let's go visit some warm places.
- What do you think?
- Where did this idea come from now?
It's been ages since you've swum.
We'll buy you a swimming
suit too, huh? Maybe a bikini?
Silly!
What is it woman? You're a stunner.
You'll put your bikini on
I will hold you on my arm and...
we will have long walks on the beach.
How am I going to leave you and go?
Where are you going, leaving me behind?
Hey, we have to put an end to
this stealing exam questions thing.
Today they called Sinan. It
could be you or me next time.
Don't panic so much.
We've just been looking for you, Kaan.
As Professor Rahmi says; do you
know why we've been looking for you?
Because we think that you took a few
extra copies of the exam questions...
you were photocopying...
Do you know why we think like this?
I don't have the questions.
I don't look at the questions.
How can you not have them?
There can't be an answer like that.
Write it down.
Write down whatever it is you know.
You keep on saying that you don't know.
How is Mert getting high grades, then?
What are you doing to our
friends? What's happening?
Who the hell are you? Come on, let's go.
Where are we going? We've just started.
Hey, his dad is a cop.
My dad is paying the salary of his dad.
Can you even hear what you are saying?
Come, come.
What the hell are you saying?
You are an ass! Let go of me!
What the hell is going on here?
What the hell are you doing here?
So, you play the bully when
I am not around, do you?
What's the matter? Get up!
So, the three of you are
beating up this good guy?
You bastards!
What's good about him?
He's stealing the questions.
Hello? What do you want,
mother? Of course I'm in school.
What Hodja? Alright. I am coming.
By the way, thank you.
- Your son has been possessed by genies.
- Possessed by who?
The genie has overtaken his body.
But don't worry, I will get rid of it.
Now that the genie's already
inside me, can you ask him...
if he would enter the student
selection exam instead of me?
What does this genie look like?
What kind of a thing is it?
Mom, I can't believe this.
I can't take this anymore.
Mom, how can you bring me here
thinking about genies and all?
Say, "in the name of God",
you are going to be warped!
What do you think I am?
In 1979, I knew the place of
the university exam. Heathens!
You've already been warped by
this man. How much did you pay him?
I repent! What money are
you talking about, son?
We paid a lot of money for the
doctor too but it didn't work, did it?
Besides, if you go on
like this, your dad
going to kill you in front of my eyes.
Enough is enough! What's he killing?
You're on one side, he's on the other.
I'm going to my father, now. I'll
talk to him about all these things.
May it be easy, Murat. Is my dad in?
The Chief has a guest with him, now.
Come and sit down. How are things?
Not bad, not bad! Will he be long?
You never know. Actually, it's
nothing serious. It's just Mr. Selcuk.
Who is that?
He's Turan's father;
Your friend from school.
My father's paying his father's salary.
Sinan, you stay here.
I will be right back.
I don't know how much
longer I can keep doing this.
We have some deputy friends involved.
Just try and manage for a month.
They're going to settle the
issue with the Prime Minister.
Actually, it's been a little
contrary to the rules in your office...
Thank you, Mr. Selcuk. You've
made me feel embarrassed.
Come on, what are you embarrassed about?
These days, it's not
easy to bring up a kid...
educating them is even.
Let's get together more often.
Sure, sir.
Has anyone called?
Sinan was here, Chief. But he was gone
when I came back from the archives.
Are you guys cheating?
Actually, it's been a little
contrary to the rules in your office...
Are you going to be a dishonest man
with no dignity? You ruined my dignity.
Don't behave as if it's the first time.
You've made me feel embarrassed, Sir.
Nothing is left unpunished.
What the hell happened?
Just let me have some water.
It's just finished.
Math is great but I flunked
again in Social Sciences.
The same with me.
Every year, they invent something new.
We are supposed to deal
with numbers not with words.
We have been doing it wrong since the
beginning. Exams at school and whatever.
Isn't our real issue the
student selection exam?
Let's just steal the questions of that
and get this whole thing over with.
Sure. As if the questions of that
exam are in Rafet's warehouse.
What the hell are you saying?
Even if we do steal the questions,
everyone else has worked so hard for it.
- Yes, it's not fair at all.
- This exam is fair, according to what?
What is right? This is our life, man.
Hold your horses, Sinan.
Why are you so angry? What's going on?
Why would I be angry? Look at us.
The whole day, we work like hell.
And for what? To enter the exam.
What's going to happen in the end?
They are going to ask you for
your future, in just 3 hours.
Then, time is going to run out and
they'll say, "Raise your hands."
And you are going to
surrender. It's that simple.
I have no intentions of surrendering.
We're losing a year from our lives.
I say that we shouldn't
leave it to luck.
Let's steal the questions and get it
over with! Are you in with me or not?
Hold your horses, man. We
already had a terrible day.
- Let's think about it over night.
- Yes, think about it.
But think carefully.
We have 8 weeks left.
Don't forget to think about this too.
Guys, we have 8 weeks left for the exam.
I know how hard you've studied.
But, you should also prepare
yourself for all its consequences.
There are no consequences.
If we don't pass, we are dead.
Come on, Kaan. You
are aware of the quota.
Some of you may need to
wait for another year.
This is not the end of life.
Don't forget that it's neither the
first nor the last exam of your lives.
What are you doing, Oguz?
I'm not doing anything, professor.
Have you realized that I am talking to
you and your friends about something...
that's really
important in your lives?
All those people that you just said
are friends, are actually my rivals.
I might be able to gain something
even if I answer one extra question.
Besides, the exam is our
life. What if we fail?
Does this mean that you'll fail if you
don't know the ratio of Ayse's babies...
to Ali's marbles?
You cannot measure your abilities
or disabilities according to these.
Life is much more than
a question booklet, Oguz.
I am sorry, professor.
Don't be. The people who've put you
in this state are the ones who...
should apologize.
Damn, she was good.
She spoke really well.
I don't know. I don't think
we should trust her that much.
She came to our house the
other day to talk to my mom.
- What did she say?
- I have no idea.
But, I went crazy thinking
that something was up.
- How's your mother, Mert?
- Fine. Why do you ask?
I just asked liked
that. No reason. Say hi.
Let's leave that now. Let's go back
to our real subject, the robbery.
That was a bit loud. Let's go
to the side and talk about it.
Our real issue is about the
student selection exam, right?
- Did you think over it?
- I did. I don't think we should do it.
Neither do I, because it's not
the same stealing from school.
Even in school we had lots of
problems with little things.
How are we supposed to steal
from the exam center, anyway?
Why don't we go and see Levent Lemi?
He's said to have almost stolen the
questions of the student selection exam.
What the hell are we going to tell him?
Are we going to say, "We're going to
steal the questions. Give us advice."?
We don't necessarily have to say it
like that. He's an open-minded person.
We'll just talk to him as if we're
having an interview for the school.
One thing will lead to another
and we might get him to talk.
Let's make an appointment.
Who's going to call?
We can't reach him by phoning.
I think it's better to write. It'd
be more proper and more formal.
I came without any notice but you've
said that I was always welcome.
- I guess I trusted that.
- Don't mention it. Sit down, please.
I have a student with problems.
His name is Mert Yildirim.
Mert Yildirim. His mother has cancer.
Their financial status isn't good.
I don't know under which
conditions she's being treated.
I thought that you may be of some help.
I received an e-mail
from your students today.
They want to interview me
for the school newspaper.
I told them they are welcome to come.
Yes, Mert Yildirim is also
with that group of students.
But we don't have a school newspaper.
Mr. Levent, your 4 o'clock
appointment is here.
Alright. Have them wait for two
minutes and then let them in.
Your students are here. Don't go.
You can wait in the room next door.
And let me find out
what their problem is.
What they want is obvious.
If you go around being proud
of your memories as a student...
they'll come and try to
learn some new methods from you.
Don't be so sure. It can be
worse than what your are thinking.
Besides, it's high time you start
trusting me a little, alright?
These are the students
who gave me a hard time...
with their questions.
Aren't you a little crowded
to conduct interview?
How are things at school after my visit?
Everyone is still talking about
you. Especially the broken arm trick.
We weren't only cheating. We
used to steal question papers too.
But now, there are the photocopy
places. You take them from there, right?
Us? How did that come about?
You're said to have almost stolen the
questions for the
student selection exam.
What do you have to say about that?
Not everyone can sneak
into an exam center...
to steal the questions.
You have to be a genie for that.
During that time, there
was a Hodja in Beykoz.
In Beykoz?
In 1979, I knew the location
of the university exam.
We gathered together with some
friends to go and see this Hodja.
Take a left from the
hall. That's the room.
Go inside and take it.
Did you take it? Perfect.
He was drowning in his own sweat. He
could see where the questions were...
in the water, and was sending
his genies there to get them.
Now, come out. Cross the street.
No, leave it. Leave it.
I'm telling you to run away. Run away.
But the next day, when I saw the
question booklets scattered...
in front of the building, I
got it. The exam was cancelled.
If he hadn't fought with those
genies at that time, they could...
have brought the booklets to us.
You will be writing this down in
the school newspaper too, right?
That's not the issue. So, is it an
impossible thing to steal the questions?
Are you guys thinking of stealing
the questions of the exam?
What does that have to do with anything?
Well, if you are, let me
tell you this right now...
this is not something
that 17 year olds can do.
The guy who stole the questions in
1999; when the exam was cancelled;...
was caught 2 years later trying to
get into Turkey with a fake passport.
What could a terrorist do
with the exam questions?
- How the hell am I supposed to know?
- Of course, you can't.
Printing all the exam booklets
means 4 billion Turkish Liras.
And if the exam was to be cancelled,
that meant another 4 billion Liras.
In this country, whenever the
questions stolen, be sure that...
there are some people
making a lot of money out of it.
- And these are not students.
- But we...
Are you guys fooling around with me?
You are actually thinking that you
are able to fool me, aren't you?
I have been there and done
that with all the adventures.
You came here. I told you a few
stories. We laughed a little bit.
But, that's all there is to it.
If you ask me, I would say don't do
something that will get you in trouble.
Don't get into ridiculous
things like this.
: Come on, I have some
important business.
How are those supposed
to watch over these kids?
I hope that this talk
will be enough for them.
- No. They're not going to give up.
- Why?
Because, at the time,
we didn't give up either.
What are we going to do then?
Sometimes a mistake you make can take
away all the good things in your life.
I guess they are about to make
the mistake of their lives.
But, don't worry about
it. I will help you.
Hey, how are you today?
I am well.
I am taking my medication and
the chemotherapy is continuing.
I've done some research and have spoken
to some doctors for your treatment.
Other than this, they have also said
that you always have to be under...
supervision. You have to be admitted
into the hospital as soon as possible.
That's impossible. You know that
it's possible in our situation.
If you won't be angry with me, I have
actually spoken to someone about it.
He's a previous student of our school.
Promised to help in your treatment.
Money is not the issue here. Mert has
an exam. He shouldn't see me like that.
I don't think there is anything more
important in his life than your health.
Even though, it's an exam that's
going determine his future?
I can't just pretend not to notice
the mistakes you're both about to make.
Please don't insist. Try and understand.
Thank you.
Gamze's still angry with me, isn't she?
Where's Mert? Have you seen him today?
Yes, it's finished. This is it.
This is where it ends. We quit.
Yes, we've heard what he
said. He sounded right too.
It has always seemed impossible to
me anyway. The only way is to study.
- There must be a way.
- Are you?
There must be a way to
steal those questions.
I guess you didn't listen to him.
He said that it's not something a 17
year could do. It would cause trouble.
I am not just speaking for myself.
I am thinking about all of us.
Can you imagine what would
happen to us if we got caught?
Let me tell you what.
A) We end up in an A type prison.
B) We end up in a B type prison.
Forget about the prison. Uncle Metin
would beat the hell out of us first.
What does my father have to do with it?
If you ask Levent, we couldn't
steal questions at the school either.
We've already come so far and
it'd be stupid to back out now.
It'll actually be stupid
to continue. I give up.
We have to think of every single detail.
We could come up with a great plan.
This is it for me too. This
is too much for me to handle.
I am out.
Great man. Great. I
thought we were friends.
Weren't we supposed to be together
all the time? You're such a fickle man!
The other day, you told us that the
exam meant the world to you
and that you wouldn't surrender.
- I have no intention of surrendering.
- What does it have to do with that?
We got into this thing all together
and we're leaving it all together.
- It's that simple.
- No, it can't be that simple.
I don't think that
you want to understand.
What is it that I don't want to
understand, Sinan? What are you saying?
Why don't you understand? Because...
Military service.
Because you don't feel like it.
They're
going to call you in
for the military duty
That's all you care about. Sorry, man.
You should have thought of this
before things got so far ahead.
I've been making you uncomfortable
since the beginning. Sorry for that.
Let go!
What the hell did you do?
His mother has cancer. Cancer!
I'm out.
That was his mother's last wish.
Did we just hear the same thing?
Where are you going?
Go back! Don't disappoint your friends.
I am not going back. And stop telling
me what to do every two minutes.
I am not your little sister.
I am already depressed. Don't
push it. Come on, go back!
I know everything!
What do you know?
The reason why you
decided to take the test...
your mother, her illness, everything!
- How do you know?
- That's not important.
- How do you know?
- What importance does it have?
Why do you think I forgave you?
Because, I've seen the things
you could do for the ones you love
even though you dumped and left me.
Now, you are telling me that you can
turn your back on me and leave again.
Go ahead, go then!
I thought you were with Sinan.
What did you think? Stupid!
I still love you so much!
Gamze was really a girl.
We are unfortunate.
He doesn't have a father
and I don't have a mother.
Don't be so dramatic all of a sudden.
Guys, what you see in my
hand Oh, he is sleeping.
Whatever. The cup you see in my hand,
is in remembrance of an adventure
that your brother Uluc
had with a British thief.
British?
I was just a little boy then.
I was playing in the stables, and
there was a man hiding at the back.
He said, "Shhhh!" And
I didn't make any noise.
Suddenly, two men entered the stable.
They looked at me. They
said, "Did you see anyone?"
I didn't say anything out of fear.
Then they left. And the man came out
of his hiding place and came up to me.
I don't really remember his
face but he stroked my hair.
In broken Turkish, he
said, "What's your name?"
And I said, "My name is
Uluc." Then he took off.
Alright, but what was a British
man doing in a stable in Istanbul?
That's what we found out
after we got this cup.
Actually, he was one of the special
thieves working for
the Queen of England.
My dad always talks about it.
These guys would go around stealing
back all the valuable things that were
once stolen from the Royal Palace.
What did they come to steal?
You know that the British horses are
the most valuable horses in the world.
They are a special breed. They
are a mixture of the Arabian and
the Middle Asian Turkish horses.
Don't they have horses in Britain?
Why are they stealing from here?
The Royal Family has them
specially bred in Caucasia.
The Russian Mafia hears of this
and they replace these foals with
pseudo-English ones.
And they sell the genuine
ones to the rest of the world.
And one of those ended up in our stable.
So, then they use their own man to
get their own horses back, right?
When he sent me this gift two months
later, my father saw it and asked me
what it was. I told him the whole story.
When my dad searched to find out the
bloodline of the foal
everything was clear
That's great. What does it say here?
Let me see. Give it here.
'My dear friend, Uluc, I owe
you one. Thank you, Charles.'
Now, you guess the rest of
it. He said he owes me one.
So, what's the deal
then? What are we doing?
Gmail, hotmail, yahoo...
I'm trying to find Charles' address
by checking all the names that are
registered under the name 'Charles'.
Then what? Are we going to e-mail
him? What are we going to say?
We need the selection exam questions.
Stop. Come with the first flight. Stop.
Is this the plan?
I know that it seems ridiculous. But,
what if one them ends up to be Charles?
Let's say that he
remembered you and replied.
Do you think he would come here?
Well, I don't know that. But you
saw it, he said he owes me one.
Besides, does anyone
else have a better idea?
This is something like throwing a
bottle in the sea with a help message
Dude, get your feet off my bed.
We are going to export something
and we don't know any English.
I told you that my English would
be enough to write him an e-mail
but you insisted on using
a dictionary. Well, here it is.
Tell him that it's a
matter of life and death.
Is it dead or death?
Isn't it D, E, A, T, H?
There are too many people named Charles.
I sent about 17 thousand e-mails.
But, that's normal.
Then, it must be a very common name
there, like we have Hasan and Huseyin.
Apparently. That's what I
figured out last night as well.
Hey, any news?
What are you looking for, dad?
I am looking for the
printout that has the
results of the final race.
Do you have it?
What could I possibly be
doing with your printouts?
I'm begging you, please get
out. I'll clean it. Get out.
As of today, we only have
7 weeks left for the exam.
I told you that it wouldn't
work. It's hopeless.
He's going to come. You'll see.
I'm going to try something else tonight.
What's going on, Uluc?
Please stand up, son. What's going on?
What are you telling your
friends? We'd like to know too.
Then why do you blabber as if there
were something important? Butterball!
I've found the e-mail addresses for
the Royal Palace and all the embassies.
Tonight, I will send an
e-mail to all of them.
Sinan, quick! Come here. There's
an e-mail from Charles. Come on!
Come on. Hurry up! - Hey
there's an e-mail from Charles.
Get up! Get ready! Uluc wants us
back in the base as soon as possible.
I love the way you say,
"My dear little friend."
Look! He started his mail by
saying, "My little friend."
And finished it by saying,
"Lots of love, Charles."
He wrote really intimate
words, didn't he my love?
He says here, Send me all the details'.
I've already written down everything
and sent it to him, before you came.
You've improved your English, huh Uluc?
What did you tell him?
I told him that I know who he is
and how good he is with these things
told him the reason why we need
the questions and things like that.
Ok, let's say that this guy comes here.
But, what if he asks us to do
things that we can't handle?
What's the maximum he could ask for?
I don't know. A)He might
require a private plane.
: B) He might require a fake
ID. C) He might ask us for money.
What money are you talking about?
He says that he owes me one.
Guys, a mail from Charles!
What's he saying?
My dear friend, Uluc. I owe you one
Your situation...
hey, what does 'sensible' mean?
Let's look it up in the dictionary.
It means 'delicate'.
I can understand that you're
in a very delicate situation.
I would be grateful to be
of some help to you guys.
He's coming here. It's wonderful.
Guys, hold on a second. We're screwed.
- Don't be so happy!
- What happened?
The writing continues. I'll
cover all of my own expenses.
As a principle, I require 2000
sterling that I took from my firstjob.
No need to pay me for anything else.
Give me a call when you transfer
the money. Full stop. Charles.
So, what is it? It's not good to
get carried away so fast, is it?
You're so annoying, always predicting
misfortune. Should I kill you?
Hey, wait a minute guys.
I'm the one who got you into this
thing, so it's my job to find the money
Yeah, sure. As if you can pay it.
Guys, with the exchange rate today,
it adds up to 4000 Turkish Liras.
So, don't give up hope yet. We
still have 5 weeks until the exam.
Listen to what I've got to say, love.
Why don't you arrange a job for us?
I seriously congratulate him.
He's seriously a man like a king.
He directly made him a
lion king. Congratulations.
Gamze, you look wonderful
in that rabbit outfit.
Don't you think we
should get it a size
bigger, so she can
wear it next year too?
I'll bring you the biggest size
so she can wear it all her life.
We could only collect 300 Turkish
Liras. We need to work harder.
- Would you like to taste our product?
- Would you like to try our new product?
I have just done this one.
How is it?
Is this big enough?
You are very beautiful. Can
I ask you a few questions?
Can I ask you a few
questions about our store?
I don't understand.
I prefer it because of it's price.
Yes, I'm using it because it's cheap.
I am burning!
Oh God, it's enough! Here
you go, sir. Thank you.
3 billion 2 hundred million.
Yeah, but it's not enough for Charles'.
I say that we send it anyway
whether it's enough or not.
You know your friends on days like
this. And if he doesn't come, I'll...
Alright then, let's send it.
Yes, Mr. Rafet. You have called for me?
There is a complaint
about you, Mrs. Erez.
It's said that you have been telling
the students to forget about the exam
that life is more
important than that.
Not exactly the way you
put it but what if I did?
What do you mean by "What if I did?"
Parents have been calling in and asking
their kids to be removed from the
intensive courses. They want their
money back. We hit the bottom.
Students don't need intensive
courses. They need to be conscious.
Stop talking nonsense, lady.
Do you have any idea
what we'd do if we
didn't have the money
from those courses?
What do you think the school runs on?
Is that money used
to run the school...
or to run other businesses in the
school? We'll find out about that soon.
Hey, what the hell are
you trying to tell me?
I'm an honorable man, okay?
You can't prove anything.
I'll start a fire in this room, and
there won't be any documents left.
I'm the Assistant Director, Mr.
Rafet! Not a bus driver's assistant!
You better watch your words.
I'm not watching them. So what?
I'm astonished! Are you
an anarchist or what?
Guys, Charles accepted
the money. He's coming.
"I didn't know that you
were so short on money."
He said, "If I had known, we'd have
thought of something else. No problem."
And how did he say that in English?
You deserve a slap, you know.
Stop it. When is he coming?
On July 14. Wednesday
of the week of the exam.
It's exactly the time when the
question booklets are being distributed.
Everything is going as we planned.
How are we going to recognize him?
Where are we going to pick him up?
He's coming with a private plane.
He asked for some cryptic sentences
for our first conversation,
and I gave them to him.
What cryptic sentences?
Don't you know this man?
He asked for a code and I told him
something that we'd all understand.
Is this his plane?
I don't know. It's time.
He actually really came, huh?
Where did the car come from?
Private plane, private car.
What have we brought like this?
He must have tons of money.
If you were to give me 3.5 billion
Liras, I'd have tons of money too.
Stop reminding me about it. Thief!
He looks like Van Damme!
How is this? Is this Charles?
I don't know. I haven't
seen him in such a long time.
Look carefully. Are we mistaken?
What are you looking for?
This is definitely Van Damme!
No way! If that's Van Damme
then I am Sharon Stone.
Our life has turned into a movie.
No, he has nothing to do with Van Damme.
I have remembered. This is
Charles. He hasn't changed at all.
And you're thinking he's Van Damme
No, he has nothing to do
with Van Damme. He's Charles.
He looks very British, doesn't he?
- Where the hell is he going?
- He is going.
Hey, he looks so much like Van Damme.
Can this be a hidden camera show?
You're going to kill me one
day. Who the hell is this?
Hello. I'm Mr. Charles'
personal interpreter.
Don't get me wrong but our
issue is a bit confidential.
I never get things wrong. I know 12
languages, and it's not my firstjob.
The booklets have been printed
already tomorrow night they'll start
distributing them
to the exam centers.
The Exam papers have been
printed already and tomorrow night
they'll go to the exam centers.
Will you do the job at the printers?
I mean, is this what he'll do?
You've said no one in the printing
room can leave until the exam hour.
The room will be crowded and risky.
Will we steal the questions
from the exam centers?
How are the booklets carried?
The booklets are hidden inside a sack.
But the sacks are sealed. If
those sacks are cut or opened
or if the seal breaks or a booklet's
stolen from the sack
the exam's cancelled.
I am a professional. When my job is
done, that place will have never been
entered, the sacks never
touched and nothing will be missing.
The booklets will have reached the exam
center in Istanbul, the same night they
leave for distribution; tomorrow.
This is the building that
we'll steal questions from.
There's a 24 hour security guard.
They check everyone who goes
in and out. Just so you know.
Doors, I never use doors.
Thank the Lord who has brought you.
The questions are
being kept in one room.
We kind of found out about which rooms
they're being kept in from the students.
There are surely no
cameras in this room.
There is only one guard
waiting for the exams and
he is not really paying attention.
Did you arrange a phone?
What's he saying?
He's asking if it's clean or
not. You fool. May God punish you.
What's wrong?
He's asking if the line's clear or not.
Yes, the line is clear, of course.
Shall we give the number?
You write it down, 536
I will steal the questions
tomorrow and then give you a call.
Yes, you will give us a call
and then we will do this thing.
The operation is completed!
Thank you.
It's a good thing that
we've taken the questions.
Who is the boss here?
- What the hell is it to you?
- Don't talk.
What are you doing here?
Hey, there's an envelope in his hand.
Give me that envelope.
Get the hell out of here.
What do you have to do
with an envelope? Move it!
Let's see what we have here. A CD?
They've been after some things
lately. We'll find out about it now.
If Mert hears of the things
we did, he will kill us.
Nonsense! School is over. Mert is past.
Other than us, there are no
more heroes around here anymore.
What's this?
This is Van Damme!
Yes, and I am Al Pacino.
Let him come. We'll meet him.
Here you go.
And this is a family souvenir, a gift.
I bow with all do respect.
We are dead if they ever open that CD.
Let's go to the neighborhood.
Maybe we can find it there.
I thank the Lord who brought you.
You did beat them up, right?
I don't believe this! We have the
booklets and no one knows about it.
Charles is a peculiar man. He's great.
He brought the questions.
- Yes, he really was a peculiar man.
- What do we do now?
We have 2 more days. We
have to answer the questions.
This is it for me, man.
What do you mean?
Don't be ridiculous. We've
worked so hard on this.
I can't look at those
questions. I can't do that.
I can't take away the rights of
all those people. Forgive me...
Kaan, are you crazy?
Here are the questions.
Yes, Gamze. This is where it ends.
Have I ever let you guys down before?
Have I ever broken out of the team?
Now, you have to respect my decision
I'll do whatever it is I know, in the
exam. I'll be more at peace like this.
Kaan, are you really serious?
Come on, please.
Congratulations, Jean Claude.
You've played your part very well.
I would have loved to see their
faces when they realize that it's the
booklet of the previous year.
We can now see all the correspondence
that the children will make, from the
- address they used to mail you.
- Good!
This is going to be really hard on
them when they learn this in the exam.
Life can sometimes be
like a mean teacher.
It'll test you first
and then teach you.
Belgian actor Jean Claude Van Damme
who caught by surprise by the reporters
last night, gave ambiguous answers
to questions and left Istanbul quietly
with his private plane
and the special team that
he brought along with him.
