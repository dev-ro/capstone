Music should be public taste.
But Sir, l hope you like our music?
lt*s good.
but it would be better,
much much better it could be.
A nice item,
And l*ll take it out from you,
now suppose
from October to January it*s a
wedding season,
To take a hit wedding song we*ll make
it*s rock remix,
But Sir, Wedding Remix in Rock album?
Why?
ls it written in lndian law that it*s
impossible.
everything works, the main point is
album should be hit.
Your slow song we will take out that
song it won*t work,,
What*s that?
whatever it is,
Sir! it*s just a soft and romantic
ballad,
what giving some dept in this album,
lt doesn*t work in these days,
Public wants tempo, today*s youth
wants a tempo song
lf you agree with me then here it
is your contract,
Look!
We have to do some understand, some
compromises in life,
from 8 to 7 songs of your wish,
one from my wish,
And there is no shortage of talent in
market.
Well done,
Congratulations,
But Sir!
there is one more thing,
We have a friend Debbie,
she styling costume modes,
We were hoping that you can use her
for our music video.
You relax, now you are the
responsibility of this company
forget all these people,
Sir! please meet her once,
you do your work in recording studio
and leave rest for us,
l am really feeling bad they reject
Joe*s song,
lt*s not a matter of my song,
this band....
To include a cheap remix song in our
first album.
l think we are doing a big
compromise,
ln that case we shouldn*t sign that
contract.
but when we signed that then....
if we won*t then someone else would,
l*m sorry Debbie that they are not
allowing you to styling,
they were saying that they already
have somebody else.
but did they saw a Debbie*s work?
l mean it*s not a bad that our 7
songs are selected from 8,
but it*s fine that unfortunately we
need them this time,
once this album become a hit then
we*ll see whatever we want,
You*re recording your first album,
what more you want,
Joe!
lt seems nothing,
do something,
then tell me what to play,
l*ll play whatever you say,
Joe!
You worked on many albums,
l*m telling you,
Subhash Jee*s movie Karz.
You all out,
Now we will take close to Aditya
You shot has done,
you guys just went,
We looks joker in these clothes, it
will be good if they will allow
you to style
What*s wrong?
You should see the matter clearly but
you have to remove this rockstar
shades to see that.
May be you didn*t notice but this
director is just focusing you.
and he put us in background in
like extra,
and in these contumes.
What do you think l am happy in these
clothes, forget it Joe,
Aditya is lead singer of this band,
they must focus him most,
Please! whatever is happening it*s
not going good,
Nobody take over the magic,
You told me, today we got a chance to
become famous and you forgot all
principles today,
Let*s talk in makeup room, come on.

gonnabe happening,
But l am professional, and you also
have to be.
You sold your self,
that director was treating us so
badly, did you stop him once,
Hello!
What*s going on here?

You keep your attitude to home,
You signed that contract, now you

Let*s do one thing, let*s go to
my home,
Will somebody come to help me,
l am not 25.
You were right that l*m angry with
my life,
but if you*ll be sad like this then
my relationship with life will go
more bad.
You were right that l*m living
incomplete life.
but if you will go like that then
that incomplete life won*t more,
you were right that l kept you away
from me.
but distance will become more increase
that l*m talking to your answering
machine not you,
l never think about it.
Please come back home.

Her husband pete,
He is a chef on blue line cruise,
Their ship is going around the world
for six months.
They need musicians,
money is very good.
Pete talked to them,
just contact them,
You are planning me to send out
of city.

them audition.
Audition?

they will love it.
But it could be much much much better.
Remember! we have to go Charlie*s

forms and formalities.
Rob, are you okay?
Nothing just a headache.

Actually! we were on brake,
now we are back.
To see you again on stage,
it will be pretty cool.
And look at your luck, this time
