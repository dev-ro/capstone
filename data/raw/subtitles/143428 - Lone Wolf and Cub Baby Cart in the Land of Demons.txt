Lone wolf with cub
The way of hell
Directed by Kenji Misumi
Forgive me my directness,
but regarding the picture on your
rag you are searching for
the lone wolf
Is that you ...?
People use to call me so.
This is the skill of the 
lone wolf,
the former Kaishakunin
of the Shogunate, ltto Ogami.
Here's 100 Ryo.
One says you cahrge 500 Ryo
for an assassination.
I have here
a fifth
of this amount.
Please take it.
You wanted to test my skills?
16 of the best swordsmen of our
clan are spread in the country.
All wear the picture of the devil
on them.
We have spread among the roads and
rivers.
l serve the Chikuzen-Kuroda-Clan
My name is Ukon Ayabe.
I can only accept when you tell 
me the whole story.
I know.
After I and four others
have tested your skills,
and you got 100 Ryo from each
of us,
you'll also get a part of the
story from each.
Thisone should be ...
Your identfication to them ...
Take it ...
Please ...
As Ukon Ayabe,
I serve the Kuroda-Clan
My name is
Kazuma lzumi.
l am ltto Ogami.
This is a message to the next
or our man.
Please accept our offer.
l am Shusuke Mogami, vassal
of the Kuroda-Clan.
Even though my skils are limited,
I'd like to test you as well.
l am ltto Ogami.
If you defeat me, please,
take the 100 Ryo,
take this necklace and
walk on. - O.K.
The Lord of the Kuroda-Klan isn't
Prince, but a princess
of five years.
The old ord told the Shogunate
she were indeed a prince.
The first visit to the Shogunate
has been delayed so far
due to her youth to a point
after her initiation as a Lord.
The former Lord, Naritaka,
already resigned.
If the Shogunate will find all this
out, the Kurda-Clan will be lost.
Please,
Save our Clan ...
... and kill the princess!
Kill the princess!
Are you the third?
My name is Hachiro Mawatari, I am
a vassal of the Kuroda-Clan.
The 100 Ryo are in my pocket.
Take them!
I agree.
There's little life left in me.
Til the last breath I'll tell you
The whole story.
Lord Naritaka loves his concubine
Otae a lot.
She gave birth to a princess,
Hamachiyo,
but he passed her off as his son,
Prince Matsumaru.
He keeps his true son Mastumaru,
from his first wife,
locked up although he is his
Descendant as well.
Lord Naritaka
There is a written document
signed by Lord Naritaka,
Whcih proves all.
Lord Naritaka gave it to
Wajo Jikei,
To keep it.
Wajo Jikei is the Chief-priest
of the Sofuku-temple,
where the shrine of the family
is kept.
He is well respected by the Lord,
the people,
and the Shogunate.
There is a certain danger that
the document will fall into the
hands of the administration, 
which will be a great threat
to the  Kuroda-clan.
Please:
destroy this document.
The document ...
One moment.
over there at the pond there's
a strange felow.
He's lying in wait for a ronin
with a baby cart.
Is it you he's waiting for?
I will help you.
That's not neccessary.
l am Yamon Kikuchi, vassal
of the Kuroda-Clan.
If you are the former Kaishakunin,
ltto Ogami, 
you must be master of the
Suio-Style.
Could you show me the mysterious technique of wave cutting?
I'd like to see it with my own eyes.
Wajo Jikei did...
Wajo Jikei is on his way to
Kamakura for a requiem.
A Monk of the Sofuku-Temples
became suspicious.
Just as in the past,
afzter Wajo Jikei received the
document,
he departed inexpectedly to
Kamakura,
Although he already cancelled.
his participation in the requiem
in the Zuizan-Temple.
to get certain, the monk risked
his life and searched for the
document.
The result of our investigations
is that Waji Jikei is the leader
of a spy-ring who rules
the territories around
Saikaido.
Apart from that he belongs to the 
Yagyu-Clan.
We assume,
he is delivering the document
to Retsudo Yagyu.
l don't need no help as I
already said.
I'm in no hurry and the case
looked interesting.
My name is Kanbei Sazareishi.
As I thought, this ronin was
after your Life.
l watched you and I am quite
impressed by your skills.
You must be exhausted. Would
you like some tea?
The tea is hot. It's my invention.
Too bamboo-tubes, sticking in
one another keep him warm.
So I can have some hot tea 
whenever I want to,
without getting poisoned.
So, here it is.
It's very hot today ...
l accept.
Master ltto Ogami?
So you do have weaknesses?
There was a high dose of poison
mixed into the tea. 
We wanted to test every aspect 
of your skills.
Forgive me.
l, Kanbe Sazareishi from the 
Kuroda-Klan, will kill you!
Please, kill Wajo Jikei
and save the document!
He keeps the document in his Sutra-
Role-Container.
Nobody except him is allowed.
to touch it.
Plase, Master Ogami.
In the name of Chief
administrator Wakita
and the Kuroda-Clan ...
For our Clan ... even when we
have to sacrifice our lives ...
Master Ogami ...
Please ...
... he wanted to meet his father
so much ... - Oh, yes!
What you see here,
is our precious family-sword ...
This is the proof ...
- Come look!
As if our desire had been listened 
too ... - Yes!
... There was one who came from the,
mountains, wanded in black.
The flower in his right hand.
They crossed the bridge 
to the village,
to visit the graves.
The story of the child who bears,
the sins of it's parents ...
Come here!
This is Miss Hana.
Miss Hana will sing for us.
Please donate afterwards.
Grown ups 18 Mon, children 9 Mon.
carplingse ...
... Goldfishes and turtles!
... Goldfishes!
- Watermelons!
sweet, deliciouse Watsermelons!
Sweet Watermelons!
Look!
Your life is mine.
You can't kill the "Mu",
the void and nothingness.
Unite your object and your
subject,
Forget yourself and melt with
the nothingness.
You can't kill me because my
inner self is now part
of the whole.
If you meet Buddha,
kill Buddha.
If you meet your parents,
kill them.
Nothingness is on the way
to murder.
If you can't kill me,
you can't walk through the gate
of murderer.
Ouch!
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt?
That should be enough for a while.
- Don't be silly.
This wasn't worth the trouble.
You're Right, mistress Oyo!
Hokuro, raise the courtain!
- Yes.
You are the well known investigator
Senzo Sinnoji.
l heard from your skills.
l am honoured. l was on my way
to introduce me.
And you're after Oyo
and her companion Tomekichi?
- Yes.
There must have a "Wanted" circular
arrived. - Right.
They are using the summer 
festivities to steal purses.
She's able to change from a nun to
a whore in one minute.
Nobody's ever seen her true self.
Pardon.
- No problem.
Ouch!
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
You wanna excuse yourself.
- Pardon.
Bitch!
Pickpocket!
Pickpocket! Pickpocket!
Shit!
This is Senzo Shinnoji.
Hey little boy, would you keep
this for me?
Don't say anything to anyone!
Promised?
This is my purse.
Rascal!
- Heh, one moment!
Hey litle boy,
Could you tell me who gave
the purse to you?
Be a good boy
and tell me who she is.
I'll give you whatever you want. 
Sweets, a flute...
Usually children talk when you
offer them such things ...
That's suspicious.
Maybe he's her relative?
Tie him up!
Senzo, he's a child.
No need to tie him up.
It's very well possible that
she uses children for her work.
l am coming from Edo,
to catch her. I'll have to save
my face.
You can rely on my instincts.
Look, what a cute little boy ...
Poor boy ...
What did he do?
Really ... That must be a case 
of misunderstanding.
You can't tie up a child like that.
It makes no sense.
You'll have to catch the thief.
If she turns herself in, it'll
all be O.K.
I'll whip this brat!
- What?
l don't like doing it,
but we'll have to take our measures
against crime. Otherwise it spreads.
l'll have to catch her today.
Pardon.
This child was arrested,
because it had to help the
pickpocket Oyo.
It won't be spared.
Following Paragraph 17 of the 
book of laws,
we'll have to whip it.
- Leave him alone
As soon as Oyo turns herself in,
we'll release it.
This is evil. And you pretend
belonging to the adminitration?
Shut up!
Won't you turn yourself in Oyo?
l blieve you have a conscience.
l know that you are somewhere
down there.
You know what you have to do to
save this child.
l think,
every human
has something good in him..
That's why I don't hate the people, 
but only what they do.
Are you listening, Oyo?
But if you don't save the child,
I'll hate you.
For the first time I will hate you
and I'll hunt you down to the
end of days.
It doesn't show no fear.
It doesn't bat an eyelid.
Poor boy ...
- What a brave child!
Go!
Start.
Mistress!
One moment!
l am Oyo. Please release him.
That's honourable, Oyo.
The administration will take that
into account.
This child is innocent.
l don't even know it.
But I gave him the purse to
keep it for me.
Well.
Little boy, somebody gave you
the purse.
Was that she?
No.
- What?
No.
Why are you saying that?
No.
If you lie,
you'll get whipped.
It was she, wasn't it?
- No.
Boy.
It's O.K.
Tell them, it was me.
No.
Why do you protect me?
Please.
No.
Are you really Oyo?
I am.
I don't understand that.
l can't imagine this little boy
lying.
As you see,
I am Oyo.
Impressive ...
There are other pickpockets
apart from Oyo.
There must be something behind
it.
I'll whip the truth out of you.
Master!
l'm asking you one last time ...
No!
- Little boy, why?
Oh, Master ...
l am Oyo.
The pickpocket.
- Shut up!
Please, please tell them
the truth.
Stop, please.
Why do you put up with it?
Just to protect me?
It wasn't you.
Boy ...
Oyo,
What did you say when you
gave him the purse?
l suppose, he feels obliged 
to you.
l told him ...
to keep it for me
and not to say a word to anyone.
He had to promise it to me.
The promise not to tell anyone
about it ...
He didn't say anything to
keep his promise.
That's how it must have been.
I believe now that you are Oyo.
It might be the child of a tramp,
otherwise his parents 
would have done something ...
Or they have other reasons ...
My dear little boy,
I'll never steal again, that's 
what I promise to you.
Thank you.
It's over now.
You may go.
Dad.
Wild geese fly above us.
The bigone first ...
the litle one behind her ...
peacefully passing over our heads.
l am Shiranui, guardian of
Lord Matsumaru.
l have already met the five 
of your people.
l know.
- Then there's nothing to talk.
Why do you atack me?
Tell me the reason for this
attack.
After you killed Wajo Jikei
and saved the document,
I'd like you to hand it over
personally to the lord.
Will you do so?
- l refuse.
l will do the assassination. After
that the job is done...
and I won't care what you do 
afterwards.
These are 500 Ryo.
There's anotherone you shall kill
for me.
I agree.
Tell me the whole story.
The persons are a five year old
child, his mother,
and his father.
Master Ogami,,
father...
of a motherless child ...
Can you kill them?
We, father and son,
are going the way of hell,
Nothing can scare us, 
we are prepared for all 
that may come...
These three persons
are our masters ...
From now on the,
Ura-Yagyu will escort you.
Lord Retsudo awaits you at the 
other side.
Daigoro,
now we enter the way of hell again.
You, who walks the way of hell,
pass the border...
The boat is sinking!
Dad.
Damned ltto Ogami.
Kill him!
Master Ogami,
leave them up to us and run!
The masked warriors from Kuroda.
Master Ogami,
I will take care of the document.
Come to Kuroda as fast as possible,
I'll follow with the document.
Give this to Lord Retsudo.
Leave me alone now.
- Aye!
Damned, ltto Ogami ...
He still has the document!
We are vassals of the Yagyu-Clan
and want to pass.
ltto Ogami, you, who resists the
Yagyu-Clan
and supports the Kuroda-Clan,
Be sure:
l will hunt you til the
youngest day.
lt's me, Shiranui.
l followed the spy until he
reached Retsudos home.
There I witnessed your great
skills, Master Ogami.
I have only one favour left to
ask from you.
Would you listen to me without
asking for details?
We, the chief administrator Wakita
and myself think, we act right
to let our clan survive..
Please, Master Ogami.
Speak.
Be it ...
Please take out the document,
you haev with you.
Open it.
Master Ogami,
Bring it to our Lord the way it
looks now.
l am talking to ltto Ogami,
former Kaishakunin of the Shogun.
We, the masked warriors are 
impressed by your skills,
you showed at the river.
We have come to take the document
you got from Wajo Jikei.
I refuse.
What?
l heard the masked warriors of the
Kurode-Clan are well known for
their spear-fighting skills.
They wear masks when they battle,
to cover the grimace faces show,
in the moment of death. 
Let me speak to you.
l feel an obligation to the vassals,
who sacrificed their lives
to bring back this document,
to Lord Matsumaru,
I would like to hand it to him
personally.
We agree.
We will be your escort.
Master Ogami, we will do the 
fighting. Hurry to Kuroda!
Damned ltto Ogami.
He enters Kuroda territory.
l am ltto Ogami,
the lone wolf.
This here is my only son,
Daigoro.
l bring back the document.
Please take it.
Master Ogami,
How dare you to come her with your 
sword at your side?
Forgive me,
but this sword, Dodanuki,
is a battlesword.
l thought that if you see that
I sealed it with my own hair
you would let me in.
You wanted to show that you 
come in peace?
Yes.
Then why did you refuse to hand
over the document?
l wanted to hand it over to the 
Lord by myself.
Where is Master Matsumaru,
Lord of the Kuroda-Clan?
He sits right in front of you.
Thats Princess Hamachiyo.
Guards!
Master Ogami,
why this sudden aggression?
The Kuroda exist since the emperor
Uda and the Genji.
Your ancestor Nyusuinyudo 
conquered Saikaido,
and his son Kanbei spread your
name throughout the whole country.
People praise and fear your clan.
You are the force of Saikaido.
A clan of warriors,
supporter of Bushido.
That's what you stand in for.
In love of the lord's concubine
you passed her daughter, 
Hamachiyo as the son,
Matsumaru.
And you locked up the true son
of your first wife.
What a cruel thing to do.
How could this ever happen?
- Shut up, ltto Ogami!
Don't move, or the masked warriors
will kill you!
l am Naritaka,
former Lord.
Father of Matsumaru.
l will take the document
Give it to me!
I agree.
This ... this is ...
Kill him!
- Yes, kill him!
Lord, better move back. - Yes.
Kazuma lzumi, Leader of the
Lord's guard! Get ready!
l am talking from warrior to
warrior.
Please, spare my Mask.
We ...
We fought for our Clan, sacrificing
our lives.
Save the clan and it' values which 
have survived for generations.
Since it is you I beg you for,
another favour.
The coup de grace.
Be it.
My Lord!
- No!
l won't. I won't commit
Seppuku.
My Lord, please ...
Commit Seppuku.
Away, away, move away!
Away!
My Lord,
do it for your people.
Please.
No!
- My Lord, please.
Kill him!
My Lord, commit Seppuku!
Kill him! Kill this lout!
Commit Seppuku, please.
- Kill him!
My Lord.
- Kill him!
Lord!
- Kill him!
Commit Seppuku!
- Kill him!
How he behaved in an exemplary
manner, our Lord.
He committed Seppuku just as
he had to do.
the ancestors will be our witnesses,
that our clan will prosper again.
Shiranui,
You committed Seppukun?
Master Ogami,
I follow my dead Lord
and acompany him on his way
to the other side.
ENDE
