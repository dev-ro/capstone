IA'
- FIRE ONE ACROSS
THE BOW, MATES!
- ONE ACROSS THE BOW!
- ONE ACROSS THE BOW, IT IS.
IA'
IA'
- ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN,
WE'RE LEAVING NOW.
I WANT YOU TWO TO PLAY NICELY,
AND DON'T FIGHT.
- IT ALL STARTED THAT
FIRST THURSDAY IN JULY.
MOM AND DAD WERE
GOING ON VACATION.
WE WERE STAYING HOME.
MOM WAS SUPER WORRIED,
BUT DAD CALMED HER DOWN.
HE SAID, "DON'T WORRY.
"THE CHILDREN WON'T
REALLY BE ALONE.
"THEIR OLD FRIEND,
PIPPI LONGSTOCKING,
"HAS PROMISED TO KEEP
AN EYE ON 'EM."
- OKAY, KIDS,
HAVE FUN AT PIPPl'S.
- YOU WOULD SAY THAT, SVEN.
NOW, I'M STARTING
TO WORRY AGAIN.
- GEE, WHAT ARE YOU
WORRYING FOR?
- THAT'S WHAT I SAY.
ANNIKA.
BYE, TOM.
- GIVE US A KISS.
- SEE YA.
- SAY HELLO TO PIPPI FOR US.
- OKAY, BYE.
- I WILL.
- SO LONG.
SEE YA!
HAVE A GOOD TIME!
- WE WILL!
BYE!
SEE YA.
- SEE YA!
- IMAGINE, LIVING AT PIPPl'S
FOR A WHOLE THREE WEEKS.
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
- GREAT!
HI, OLD MAN!
- HI, OLD MAN.
HOW ARE YOU?
WANT A PIECE OF SUGAR?
OKAY, THERE YOU ARE.
CHEW IT CAREFULLY.
HOW IS IT'?
GOOD?
SURE.
- PIPPI!
- PIPPI, WE'RE HERE!
PIPPI!
- PIPPl!
- PIPPl!
- PIPPl!
- WHERE ARE YOU, ANYWAY?
- PIPPl!
- I FOUND HER ON THE COUCH.
SOUND ASLEEP.
WAKE UP!
- PIPPI, WHERE
HAVE YOU GONE?
- WELL, YOU JUST
TRY TO FIND ME.
- SHE'S OUTSIDE
IN THE YARD.
PIPPI!
- WATCH OUT!
I'M COMING IN
FORA LANDING!
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU CAN'T FLYA BED-.
- NOBODY CAN FLY A BED-.
- IT lSN'TA BED.
THIS IS A--
MMM...
lT'SAZEPPELIN.
- AW, THAT'S NO ZEPPELIN.
- SURE, IT ISAZEPPELIN.
I SHOULD KNOW.
I BUILT IT, DIDN'T I?
IA'
EXCUSE ME, MY BEARD
NEEDS A LITTLE TRIMMING.
NOW I LOOK JUST
LIKE PIRATE FABE.
- PIRATE FABE?
WHO'S THAT?
- HE WAS MY GRANDFATHER.
CAPTAIN FABIAN LONGSTOCKING.
MOST DANGEROUS PIRATE
OF THE SEVEN SEAS.
HE ONLY ROBBED
BIG SHIPS
BECAUSE THEY CARRIED
LOTS OF TREASURE.
AND ALL THE TREASURE HE
BURIED IN A SECRET CAVE,
ON A FARAWAY ISLAND,
WHERE IT REMAINS HIDDEN
TO THIS VERY DAY.
- IMAGINE, THE TREASURE
OF A PIRATE.
- THEN THAT'S WHERE
YOU AND YOUR DAD GO
TO GET THOSE GOLDEN COINS.
- UH-HUH.
GEE, THEY DONT
MAKE BEDS LIKE THEY USED TO.
PIPPI, THE PIRATE
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD,
DOESN'T IT?
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GOING TO THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
- OH, SURE, YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN GOT A BOAT.
- WHO NEEDS A BOAT?
I'LL JUST WALK
ON THE WATER.
- WALK ON WATER!
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY.
- OKAY.
IA'
- WELL, NOW WE KNOW
YOU CAN'T WALK ON WATER.
- BUT THEN I
HAVEN'T PRACTICED.
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE
TO DO ANYTHING WELL.
- I SEE A BOTTLE OUT THERE
WITH A NOTE INSIDE.
- HEY, YEAH.
I THINK, YOU'RE RIGHT, ANNIKA.
DON'T WORRY.
NO SECRET MESSAGE EVER GOT AWAY
FROM PIPPI LONGSTOCKING.
- IS IT REALLY
A BOTTLE MESSAGE?
- I THINK SO.
THERE'S A PAPER
INSIDE IT, ANYHOW.
- ISN'T THIS EXCITING?
- HERE, YOU TAKE IT, TOMMY.
YOU'D BETTER READ IT,
'CAUSE I STILL DON'T KNOW
ALL THE LETTERS.
- PIPPI, FROM YOUR PAPA!
- WELL, HURRY.
READ THE WORDS.
- "PIPPI, COME HELP ME
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE."
- READ THE REST, FAST!
- WELL, IT SAYS, "I'VE BEEN
CAPTURED BY PIRATES."
- OH, PAPA,
HOW COULD YOU?
- "THEY'VE TAKEN
MY SHIPAND CREW,
"AND PUT US ASHORE
ON A DESERTED ISLAND-.
"ME, I SEEM TO BE IN
A SMALL PIRATE'S TOWN.
"BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHERE EXACTLY,
"'CAUSE I WAS BROUGHT
HERE BLINDFOLDED.
"REMEMBER THOSE TWO NEW
MEN I WROTE ABOUT'?
"WELL, THEY GOT TOGETHER
WITH A BAND OF PIRATES,
"ORGANIZED A MUTINY,
"THEN BECAME PIRATE
CHIEFS THEMSELVES,
"CALLED BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE."
"THEY HAVE ME LOCKED UP
IN A MUSTY OLD FORT,
"AND THEY PLAGUE ME
NIGHT AND DAY
"TO TELL THEM WHERE
THE TREASURE IS.
"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, PIPPI,
COME HELP ME BEFORE I STARVE.
"ALL THEY GIVE ME
IS BREAD AND WATER."
- BREAD AND WATER?
MY POOR PAPA.
- CHUBBY.
HEY, CHUBBY.
ARE YOU WEAKENING,
CHUBBY, EH?
- STOP CALLING ME CHUBBY.
CHUBBY.
CHUBBY, HUH?
- KEEP LAUGHING,
ROSALINDA.
SEE?
- EH?
- A MESSAGE.
NOW ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS WAIT.
- YOU JUST WAIT, CHUBBY.
YOU JUST WAIT.
- I DON'T WANNA WAIT!
I DON'T WAN NA WAIT!
I WANNA GET OUT!
- I'VE GOTTA GET UP A
RESCUE EXPEDITION, FAST.
- WE'LL GO WITH YOU, PIPPI.
- MOMMY WON'T LIKE THAT, TOMMY.
WE'D BETTER STAY HOME.
- OH, I THINKALL THREE
OF US GOING TOGETHER
ISA NEAT IDEA.
- I DON'T.
- DIDN'T I PROMISE
ON MY WORD OF HONOR
TO LOOKAFTER YOU
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE?
- WELL, YES.
- IF I LEFT YOU HOME,
I WOULDN'T BE KEEPING
MY WORD, WOULD I?
AND WHO KNOWS WHAT COULD
HAPPEN TO THE TWO OF YOU
WHILE I WAS AWAY?
TERRIBLE THINGS, MAYBE.
- THAT'S TRUE.
- NOW, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
WE'RE GOING TO NEED
ON THIS EXPEDITION.
WE'RE GONNA NEED
ATELESCOPE...
A REAP'. --...
A SEXTANT...
AND THIS.
THIS IS GREAT.
- WHAT'S SO GREAT?
- FIRST, IT WAS PURCHASED
IN ACAPU LCO.
IT'S A MAGIC BALL.
NO FOOLING.
IT BELONGED TO
A FORTUNE TELLER.
CRYSTAL...
CRYSTAL BALL.
WHAT'S BECOME OF PAPA?
GOOD BALL...
FAMOUS BALL...
WHERE'S PAPA?
SHOW ME WHERE HE IS.
AW, THE STUPID THING
DOESN'T WORK.
WE'D BETTER TAKE THIS GUN.
" WOW!
- I KNOW MOM WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT A THING
IF SHE KNEW YOU WERE
PROTECTED WITH A GUN.
- SURE, SHE'D BE GLAD.
- IMAGINE, GOING TO
A REAL PIRATE'S TOWN.
HOW EXCITING!
- CRYSTAL BALL...
CRYSTAL BALL.
OH, IF ONLY THAT CRYSTAL BALL
WASN'T SO STUPID.
I WAS SURE IT WOULD SHOW US
WHERE MY PAPA IS.
- PORTO PILUSE.
PORTO PILUSE.
- GOODBYE, OLD MAN.
" BYE!
" BYE!
- DON'T EAT ALL
YOUR OATS AT ONCE.
SAVE SOME FOR LATER.

I BROUGHT THIS ALONG,
JUST IN CASE.
- WHAT KIND OF BOOK
DID YOU BRING'?

WITHOUT SUCH KNOWLEDGE,
IT CAN BE DANGEROUS TO COME
TO AN UNINHABITED ISLAND.
YOU READ, TOMMY.
- "FIRST, YOU CUT DOWN
A LOT OF TREES.
"NEXT, YOU--"
- OOP!
WE DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE ALONG AN AXE.
MMM...

DOWN ALL THOSE TREES FOR US.

SAY, TOMMY,
BEAVERS HAVE TO HAVE AWFUL
TASTES IN THEIR MOUTHS.
HOW CAN THEY
STAND IT'?
I COULD NEVER
BE A BEAVER.
- ARE BEAVERS DANGEROUS?
- ANNIKA, I TOLD YOU,
THERE ARE NO DANGEROUS
ANIMALS ON THIS ISLAND.
- PIPPI!
I FOUND YOUR COMPASS!
- HEY, THAT'S GREAT!
GEE, WASN'T THAT LUCKY?
- WHAT IS IT, PIPPI?
- IT'S MY PAPA.
I DO WONDER HOW HE IS...
OUT THERE.
IA'
- WELL, CHUBBY, HAVE YOU
DECIDED TO SPEAK UP'?
- LOOSEN HIS TONGUE,
BLOD-SVENTE.
- ROSALINDA'S RIGHT.
UNLESS YOU TELL US WHERE
YOU BURIED THE TREASURE,
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOSEN UP
YOUR TONGUE A LITTLE.
- OH, BLOD-SVENTE,
ABOUT LOOSENING THAT TONGUE.
DO YOU, UH, SUPPOSE WE
COULD DO IT BEGINNING NOW,
WITH THIS?
STEEL WORKS BETTER
THAN BREAD AND WATER.
- TRUE.
- WAIT TILL PIPPI SHOWS UP.
BOTH YOU RATS
ARE THROUGH.

YOUR PIPPI IS ALL

WINDY TODAY, lSN'T IT?

NOW LOOK, CHUBBY.
PIPPI DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT WE'RE HOLDING YOU HERE.

SEE THAT?
THAT'S FLASK-POST.
I SENT HERA NOTE
EACH MORNING.
PRETTY CLEVER, EH?

DON'T YOU BE AFRAID.
- HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA
GET OFF THIS ISLAND?
- GOOD QUESTION, ANNIKA.
- BEFORE, YOU SAID NO BOATS
EVER PASS THIS ISLAND.

THAT WAS SILLY.
- WHY?
- FOR ALLI KNOW,
A SHIP MIGHT BE HEADING
THIS WAY RIG HT NOW.
- SURE.

WHAT'S THAT?
TOMMY, ANNIKA,
COME OUT QUICKLY!
- WHAT'S WRONG?

IT'S COME.
THAT SHIP I MENTIONED
LAST NIGHT.
- HEY, WAIT!
THAT'S A PIRATE-SHIP!
- BUT, PIPPI, BLOIIFSUENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE
MIGHT BE IN CHARGE.
- WELL, THEY'VE
SAILED IN OUR PORT!
- HEY, WATCH OUT, PIPPI!
SHARKS, SHARKS!
- THE OCEAN IS FILLED.
IT'S FILLED UP
WITH BIG SHARKS.
COME BACK!
- WHO'S AFRAID OF
SOME OLD SHARKS?
GETAWAY, YOU OLD SHARK.
I HAVE TO GET THROUGH.
THAT'S THE WAY.
THAT'S A GOOD SHARKIE.
- WELL, GOOD MORNING.
ONE-EYED OSKAR,
WHAT GETS YOU UP SO EARLY?
- WELL, LOOK, KALLE,
A MAN HAS TO SLEEP SOMETIME.
EVEN IF HE IS
AN ADVENTURER.
WELL, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'LL SAY
AFTERWARDS ABOUT US?
- WHAT?
- THAT YOU AND ME,
KALLE THE FOX
AND ONE-EYED OSKAR,
ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS
PIRATES ON THE SEVEN SEAS.
WE'LL LAUGH AT THOSE PIGS.
THAT BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE.
MOVE OVER, BOYS!
MAKE ROOM!
- AND ONCE WE GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT LONGSTOCKING GUY,
WE WON'T BE JUST THE MOST
DANGEROUS ON THE SEVEN SEAS,
WE'LL BE THE RICHEST!
SET SAIL, LADS!
TO PORTO PILUSE!
TO PORTO PILUSE!
WHAT WAS THAT?
- OH, THE WATER'S
ALIVE WITH SHARKS.
LOOK, YOU JUST
LEAVE BLOD-SVENTE
AND JOCKE THE KNIFE TO ME.
WITH MY OWN HANDS,
I'LL PUT 'EM RIGHT ON THE PLAN K,
AND THEY'RE FINISH ED.
- AND THAT LONGSTOCKING GUY
GOES RIGHT DOWN TO THE HOLD,
AND THERE HE STAYS
ON BREAD AND WATER,
TILL HE SQUEALS ABOUT WHERE
HE'S BURIED HIS TREASURE.
- QUICK, GET OUR THINGS OUT!
- WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO, PIPPI?
- WE'RE GOING TO BECOME PIRATES
AND TAKE THAT SHIP.
- HOW WILL WE BE
ABLE TO DO THAT?
- AS GRANDFATHER USED TO SAY,
WE HAVE TO BE CLEVER.
- POOR BLOD-SVENTE.
I'M GLAD I'M NOT
IN HIS SHOES.
- AND NOT IN
JOCKE'S EITHER.
COME OVER HERE.
- OSKAR!
- OSKAR!
- OSKAR!
- WHO IN THUNDER
CAN THAT BE?
- OSKAR!
- WILL YOU TELL ME
WHO KNOWS ME OUT HERE?
- DON'T ASK ME.
- OSKAR!
- COME, OSKAR!
- THE lSLAND'S UNINHABITED,
ISN'T IT?
GHOSTS, YOU THINK?
BUT WHAT COULD
THEY WANT FROM ME?
HELLO!
WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME THERE?
- OSKAR!
OSKAR!
COME AND GET THE
TREASURE, OSKAR!
- PIRATE TREASURE.
- DON'T WORRY, OSKAR.
WE'LL ALL GO WITH YOU.
EVERYBODY IN THE BOATS.
- RAFAEL, YOU REMAIN ABOARD
AND KEEP A SHARP WATCH.
- HEAVE!
HEAVE, TOO,
ME HEARTIES!
HEAVE!
- OSKAR!
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S GET THAT TREASURE!
- OSKAR!
- I HEARD IT OVER HERE.
OVER HERE.
OVER HERE SOMEWHERE.
- OSKAR.
YOU SEE THAT?
- A MONKEY WITH CLOTHES ON.
HEY, THAT'S SCARY.
- DUMB MR. NILSSON.
YOU MAY HAVE RUINED
OUR WHOLE ESCAPE PLAN.
- HEY, YOU THINK
THE MONKEY CALLED?
- NAH.
I KNOW THEY'RE
NOT THAT SMART.
- BUT THIS ONE LIVES ON
AN UNINHABITED ISLAND,
DRESSED LIKE A PERSON.
- EH... COME!
- MR. NILSSON,
COME DOWN!
- WELL, THEY GOTTA
BE HERE SOMEPLACE!
- WHO SAYS SO?
MAYBE THEY'RE BLASTED SPOOKS,
IS WHAT THEY ARE.
- SPOOKS, MY FOOT.
THEY'RE HERE.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
IT SUDDENLY GOT SO QUIET.
WHY DON'T THEY SHOUT
OR CALL OUT,
SO WE CAN TRACE
THEIR VOICES?
- LISTEN, SOMETHING FISHY'S
GOING ON AROUND HERE.
- OOH.
- HELLO, HELLO!
BACK TO THE BOATS!
BACK TO THE BOATS, EVERYBODY!
- WHOA!
- YOU, JUMP INTO THE BOAT
BEFORE THE SHARKS GET YOU.
- HELP!
KALLE!
OSKAR!
KALLE!
OSKAR!
- OSKAR! OSKAR!
- HEY, OUR SHIP, OUR SHIP!
IA'
- PIPPI, I DO FEEL SORRY
FOR THOSE PIRATES.
HOW ARE THEY SUPPOSED
TO GET OUT OF THERE?
- BUT THEY HAVE
BOATS, ANNIKA.
AND THEY ALL CAN ROW,
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.
- HEY, THAT RHYMES!
BUT ARE WE ALLOWED TO TAKE
THEIR BOAT AWAY FROM THEM
LIKE THAT?
- IT ISN'T THEIR BOAT.
THEY CAPTURED IT,
AND THEN TOOK IT RIGHTAWAY
FROM SOMEONE ELSE!
- WE'LL BORROW IT TILL WE GET
HOME TO VILLA VILLEKU ILA.
THEN THE FIRST
THING I'LL DO
IS STICK AN ADVERTISEMENT
IN THE PAPER.
"FOUND, ONE PIRATE SHIP.
"MAY BE CLAIMED BY
GIVING DESCRIPTION."
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
HOW FILTHY YOU CAN GET
ON THESE EXPEDITIONS, TOM.
- GOOD THING
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
- BETTER GIVE
YOUR SHIRT TO ME.
PIPPI, GIVE ME YOUR APRON.
- HERE, ANNIKA.
IA'
- HA-HA!
- THERE YOU ARE.
- AW, NO!
THERE IS THE PIRATE FABE!
DREAD MENACE OF
THE SEVEN SEAS.
HA-HA!
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT,
"HA-HA?"
- WELL, HAVEN'T YOU HEARD,
THAT'S WHAT ALL PIRATES SAY.
HA-HA!
DON'T YOU JUST LOVE PIRATE
SHIPS THAT ARE FULL OF GRUB?
L'! I ill h'! E
I'LL STAND WATCH.
GO GET SOME GRUB, MATE.
- SO, PIRATE FABE HIMSELF
WILL BE AT THE HELM.
- YUP.
- GOOD.

YOUR LEVEL MUCH,
BUT AT LEAST
IT'S A START.
- GOOD.
- POOR MARCO.
- IT WASN'T MARCO'S FAULT,
YOU BIG, OBJECTIONABLE BULLY.
IT WAS COMPLETELY THE FAULT
OF THOSE TWO DEVILS.
AND SINCE THEY'RE BEHAVING
JUST LIKE-LIKE CHILDREN,
THEY SHOULDN'T
BE OUT SO LATE,
'CAUSE THEY'LL WORRY THEIR
POOR MAMAS AND PAPAS.

SOUNDS AWFUL.
IA'

- NEEDS TO BE OILED.
- THOSE CANNONS
THAT I CALLED FOR
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELIVERED
HERE A LONG TIME AGO.
WHERE ARE THEY?
THIS IS DISGRACEFUL.

PIPPI.
WHEN SHE DOES,
I'M GONNA LET HER HAVE IT
RIGHT IN THE KISSER.
THAT BRAT IS GETTING
ON MY NERVES.
I'M SICK AND TIRED.
I MEAN IT!
- WELL, YOU'D BETTER TRY
OUT THE CANNONS FIRST
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE
WORKING RIGHT.
- AYE-AYE, CAPTAIN.
TEST ALL CANNON.
WHO DID THAT?
- WHO FIRED?
- BATTLE STATIONS!
- OH, MY!

TOMMY, ANNIKA...
LET'S GET GOING.
WE ONLY HAVE
A FEW SECONDS .
- WHERE WE GONNA GO?
- WE'LL HIDE IN THE WELL.
- THIS I KNOW MOMMY
WOULDN'T LIKE.
SHE GETS HYSTERICAL
EVEN IF WE GET OUR FEET
A TI NY, LITTLE BIT WET.
- I THINK SHE'S
A BIT SQUEAMISH.
- LET'S CHANGE
THE SUBJECT.
LOOK, PIPPI, HOW LONG
ARE WE GONNA STAY HERE?
- I THINK UNTIL TONIGHT,
WHEN THE PIRATES GO TO SLEEP.
- AND FIRE!
AND FIRE!
AND FIRE!
- "AND FIRE" MEANS
QUITE AN EXPLOSION.
GEE, IF I ONLY KNEW WHERE
THEY WERE HOLDING MY PAPA
AS THEIR PRISONER.
I THINK I'LL GO UP THERE
AND HAVE A LOOKAROUND.
- CAREFUL, PIPPI.
- ARE YOU WEAKENING
YET, CHUBBY?
I'M WEAKENING.
I THINK I'VE
LOST ALL COU RAGE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT
PIPPl'S EVER COMING.
I GUESS SHE NEVER
GOT MY BOTTLE NOTES.
- BRAVO, BRAVO!
- YOU ARE THE MEANEST PAPAGAYA
I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE
TO MEET.
- KISS ME.
KISS ME.
- NO, I CAN'T.
I CAN'T.
MUST HANG UP THIS HANKY
TO DRY OUT.
- I KNOW WHERE
THEY'VE GOT MY PAPA.
HE'S IN THE EAST TOWER.
I SAW HIS BIG HANDKERCHIEF
HANGING OUTSIDE.
- ARE YOU POSITIVE THAT IT'S
HIS HANDKERCHIEF YOU SAW?
- SURE, I GAVE IT TO HIM MYSELF
AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT,
YOU SEE.
IA'
- WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
- I DON'T KNOW THE WORDS.
IT'S A SCANDINAVIAN
PIRATE SONG.
GRANDFATHER FABIAN
USED TO SING IT, TOO.
- PROBABLY BRAGGING ABOUT
HOW GREAT THEY ARE.
IA'
- OH, PIPPI,
I'M SO HUNGRY.
- I AM, TOO.
- WELL, WE'LL FIX THAT.
- STEP OVER HIM.
WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.
- IT LOOKS LIKE-LOOKS
LIKE JOCKE THE KNIFE.
- YES, IT'S JOCKE,
ALL RIGHT.
BUT HE'S KNIFELESS.
THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE
MY PAPA'S A PRISONER.
- WE CAN'T GET
UP THERE, PIPPI.
THERE'S JUST NO WAY.
- YES, I KNOW THAT.
BUT BY FABIAN, I TELL YOU
THAT I MUST GET UP THERE.
YOU TWO WAIT HERE.
- BUT WHAT'LL WE DO
IF THE PIRATES WAKE UP?
- HIDE IN THE CANNONS.
YOU'LL FIND IT
QUITE SAFE THERE.
- COME ON.
IA'
OH, PAPA.
LOOK, HE'S BEEN CRYING.
OH, PAPA.
PAPA, CANT YOU JUST FEEL
THAT YOUR PIPPI ls HERE?
PAPA, PAPA.

PERCHED ON THE BED.
OH, PIPPI, THIS IS
THE NICEST DREAM.

EVERY HOUR, THERE ARE
GUARDS WHO SHOW UP.
HOW DID YOU
GET IN HERE?

IF YOU HADN'T
GAINED WEIGHT.
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.
IMAGINE, I'VE GROWN
