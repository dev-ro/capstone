Orthodox. Solid fighter.

[Laughing]
Hey, but he do got a good jab.
He overreaches though.
He tore his labrum last year

"Diamond" dame Anderson!
Yeah.
Let's get it, boy.
Let's get it, man.
What did I tell you, huh?
What'd I tell you?
I sat that boy down.
That straight right, it's clean.
Bro, but when
you put him to sleep, though,

- [Chuckling]
- [Snoring]
- [Laughing]
Man, the first thing
I'ma do, man...
The first thing I'ma do,
I'ma get me
one of them big-ass diamonds.
- Hey.
- [Dame chuckling]
I'ma get you one too,
little homey.
Hey.
Yes, sir.
- Appreciate you.
- [Chuckles] No doubt, man.
- For real.
- No doubt.
You know, actually,
I got you something too.
It belonged to my pops.
It's original.
[Dame] Rumble in the jungle?
Yeah.
[Chuckles] Yeah.
I'ma get there one day.
Yeah, I'ma get there.
I'ma win nationals,
taking home
the gold at the Olympics,
and then I'm turning pro.
Don't trip.
You'll be right there with me.
Shit, someone gotta
carry my bags.
Bro, why you gotta
play with me like that, bro?
[Adonis] I already know
what I want. What you getting?
- [Dame] Cherry pie, apple pie.
- [Adonis] Cherry pie?
- Got you. Chili cheese fries?
- Yeah, come on.
- Pineapple soda?
- All that.
All on you, boy. Big money.
Leon?
Huh?
Don't remember me, do you?
[Scoffs]
Am I supposed to remember you?
- Not so little anymore.
- [Grunting]
My name's Donnie.
You remember me now?
[Announcer]
We're live, round one,
as Adonis creed
battles his old rival
in what creed has said
will be his final fight.
Todd Grisham
alongside the champion,
And right out of the gate
with an impressive combo.
Is Conlan looking this good
or creed looking this bad?
[Mccaskill] If he doesn't
do something fast,
he's going to end
his historic career
with another loss to Conlan.
- There we go.
- Put that jab in his face.
Okay. Same creed.
Ain't nothing changed.
[Grisham]
Conlan stalking his prey,
pushing creed
towards the corner.
[Mccaskill]
You've got to wonder
if the moment
is getting to creed here.
Conlan is banging away
with the right hand.
[Trainer] Look to your right.
[Grisham] Seems to be
the same combination
he's throwing over and over,
and creed can't stop it.
[Grunting]
[Grisham] Creed,
getting out of the corner.
Good jab,
but Conlan not fazed at all.
[Trainer]
Keep that in his face.
[Mccaskill] Big left
from Conlan.
[Grisham]
Oh, he's got him on the ropes.
Creed taking quite a beating.
- [Bell rings]
- And wow.
Next round's gonna hurt, champ.
[Crowd cheering, murmuring]
You okay, Donnie?
Come on, Donnie.
You gotta work, baby.
Yo, what you smiling for, dawg?
He over there beating you worse
Like, is something I miss
that's funny?
Yeah, man. Checkmate.
Checkmate? Oh, okay.
You sure about that?
I ain't never been scared
of a little contact.
I'm going out how I came in.
Man, you're crazy, all right.
Stop playing, knock him out.
- How you feeling?
- Looking great.
He had a good run.
But it's time
to take back what's ours.
[Sighs]
[Crowd cheering]
[Mccaskill] Creed's had
a remarkable career,
but you wonder if father time
has finally caught up
This is getting dangerous
for creed.
[Grisham] Ooh, the champ
finally lands one.
[Trainer]
Come on, Donnie. Work this.
Beautiful, Ricky.
Beautiful. Just like that.
One more time.
[Grisham]
And down goes Conlan!
What a moment!
And I don't think
Three, four, five,
six, seven,
eight,
nine,
ten.
Yeah!
[Grisham]
And that's it, folks.
- It's over.
- [Crowd cheering]
What a chess move
from Adonis creed.
[Mccaskill] Just incredible.
What a turn. What an ending.
That's how you go out.
[Grisham]
Who would expect anything less
as he takes his final bow
on the world stage?
What an exit.
Respect, Conlan.
Hell of a fight.
[Grisham] And that means
we've got a new, undisputed
heavyweight champion
of the world
for the first time
in two decades,
and his name is Adonis creed.
[Snoring]
[Gentle music playing]
[Adonis grunting softly]
[Sniffs]
[Adonis grunts, coughs]
What's up?
You don't remember.
Remember what?
C'mon, daddy. You promised.
[Mutters]
Five minutes.
Okay, okay, okay.
[Grunts]
Yes. All right.
[Groans]
Would you like
some more tea, Princess?
Yes. Thank you, kind sir.

This is hot.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
This the track you've been

- Yeah.
- Okay.
We had a good session,
but I don't know.
What you mean you don't know?
Can you send this to me?
- Yes, yes.
- I need this in the car.
How was today?
- It was good. Yeah.
- Yeah?
Thank you for holding it down.
Did you get her to bed?
- I did.
- Mmm.
So, I'm not gonna lie.
I had to bribe her
with about six scoops
I don't even know how she sleep.
Retirement made you soft,
you know that?
I can't tell that girl no.
I think you had
a couple scoops too
- Mmm.
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, that's bad.
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
Take that off
before it stains, D.
Oh, I see
what you're trying to do.
What's that?
You're trying to get me naked.
Oh, no, no. I'm definitely
not trying to do that
I see what you were

No, you can just own it.
It's okay.
I know you just wanna

Mm-mmm. Okay.
Okay, let's go.
Okay, I just... I have, like,
about 15 minutes
because I have to send

How about 12?
[Bianca] All right.
Twelve will do.

[Bus announcer]
Next stop, Leimert park.
- [Boxers boxing]
- [Indistinct talking]
[Person]
Body, head. Body, head.
Efficiency over power, baby.
Give it to him.
[Grunting]
[Speaks Spanish]
[Trainer]
Technique. Technique, Felix.
You can't just punch
your way through Drago.
We got a plan, so stick to it.
- Come on.
- Make him work for it.
It's not only about power.
It's timing, speed.
- Shit, you're telling me?
- Come on now.
Keep drilling into him.
[Trainer]
Technique. Technique.
- Time.
- [Bell buzzes]
Hey! Time!
[Person] Felix. Get over here.
These guys are trash.
We need a new batch,
and we need it fast.
It's hard.
You've chewed through
You want me to pull back?
You know Drago
[In Spanish] We're here
to train, we're here
You taught me that
and that is what
Okay...
[In English] Hey, Felix.
Ven aqui.
What's up, champ?
You wanna help me
What, and mess up this suit?
I don't think so.
I'm trying
to get you paid, Felix.
We can't get you paid
if you keep knocking out
all these sparring partners,
okay?
You gotta be ready
to fight Drago in four weeks.
You're the champ.
We know you got power.
But it's not always about
how hard you can hit.
- It's about control and focus.
- You're right.
Listen to Duke.
Yes, sir.
See? You play too much.
- Listen to Duke.
- [Duke] Did you hear that?
"Listen to Duke."
Those three words.
Not "I love you."
Not "take it easy."
None of that.
"Listen to Duke."
I understand
exactly what they're asking.
Drago's got a bigger name,
that's true,
His split's got to be bigger.
I don't care
if they don't like it.
Hey, let me call you right back.
Hey, my man.
Can I help you?
- Let me get an autograph.
- No, I ain't signing
Would you get off my car?
Oh, homey.
You don't remember me, huh?
You come a long way
from bumming rides
Dame.
- [Exhales] Boy, you had me.
- [Dame laughing]
Damian.
Yeah, just got back to the hood.
Stopped by the old gym,
but, uh...
Yeah, we upgraded
a couple years ago, you know?
I see.
- Damn, it's, uh...
- It's been a minute.
Been a minute.
Hey, I don't wanna take up
your time or nothing, man.
I just wanted to let you know
what's good.
I'm around.
If you wanna catch up, you know,
Where you about to head now?
Shit, back to the crib.
You got time to get some grub?
[Dame] Thank you.
- Thank you.
- [Server] Enjoy.
I'm surprised
you still come here
I mean, when I can.
There's a lot of things
I used to do
Busy living that high life, huh?
Yeah.
Guess it comes with the job.
All right.
Yo... easy, easy. Damn, bruh.
You know how long it's been
since I had this shit?
How long?
Eighteen years, bro.
You've been down
this whole time?
Had a few years tacked on,
but... yeah.
[Sighs]
Just got out last week.
Well, congratulations on that.
Thank you.
Wrote you a few times.
- You did?
- Where'd you send 'em?
She still up in Bel Air?
Yeah, she's still there.
Same house.
But I never got 'em.
You know I watched
every one of your fights
You finally
made it to Africa, huh?
- You seen that?
- Saw that.
Made me proud
how you ended your run.
Look like you still remember
some of them moves
You know what I remember?
You knocking my ass out.
[Dame laughing]
You know what I remember?
Helping your big ass back up.
Remember that?
- Yeah, you did.
- All right, then.
You got work?
I got plans. [Chuckles]
Keep my nose clean.
Keep my po off my ass.
[Adonis] Mm.
Listen, if there's anything
I can do for you,
if I can help at all, just ask.
What am I talking about?
You just came home.
Whatever you need. Aight?
Don't hesitate, bruh.
I'm straight, bro.
I'm good.
I got it all situated.
I ain't come to see you
for no handout.
Nah, I didn't mean it
like that. It was...
Respect.
So, what's the plan?
Same program
last time you saw me.
I wanna be champ.
You still wanna box?
Hey, I know I've been
away a long time.
I kept myself in shape.
I got some moves
you ain't seen yet.
Yeah. You...
- You looking diesel.
- I ain't joking.
I'm ready.
I still got gas in the tank.
And I gotta get me that chain.
Can't be "diamond" dame
looking bum my.
- "Diamond" dame.
- [Dame laughing]
That's right.
All right.
Come by the gym.
Get you set up with Duke.
- For real?
- Yeah.
For real.
All right, then.
Thank you.
[Ominous music playing]
[Grunts]
Yo, yo, yo!
[Grunts]
[Gun cocks]
- [Bianca laughs]
- What's so funny?
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to convince your mama
so I can have
my own live-in braider.
[Bianca and Adonis laugh]
Yeah.
Careful what you wish for.
- Oh, I'm not worried.
- [Mary-Anne chuckles]
It's actually not a bad idea.
And how you feeling, mama?
You good?
I'm good.
- [Adonis] You sure?
- [Mary-Anne] Oh, yeah.
Okay.
I'd be better if my son
showed up on time for dinner.
Ouch. Uh, sorry.
- Mmm.
- I just got caught up.
Mm-hmm.
There. Look at that.
Who's the real champ
in this family?
You are.
No. You.
Go see for yourself.
Thank you grandma. I love you.
You're welcome.
I love you.
Hey.
No TV.
[Mary-Anne snorts]
Fine. I love you.
[Laughing] You're gonna have
your hands full with that one.
We already do.
- No. She's the best.
- Yes, we do.
She is.
- You're the worst.
- Oh, come on, mama.
- You're the worst.
- [Chuckles] Stop...
- Here, ma.
- Thank you.
B, think that's a good idea?
[Bianca] Baby, not tonight.
[Adonis] But we talked
about this.
- [Bianca] One thing at a time.
- [Adonis] Okay.
Okay. We are not doing this
this evening, okay?
And just so we're straight
and everybody knows,
I am not leaving my house.
Understood?
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.
- [Bianca] Okay.
- [Mary-Anne] Okay.
And I really am fine.
I promise you,
I am not gonna have
Okay?
Have it tomorrow night.
- Mom. That's...
- [Bianca and Mary-Anne laugh]
That's not funny.
[Bianca chuckling]
It's a little funny.
And you're not helping.
You know
that we're worried about you.
- That's it.
- We can leave it now.
And we wanna be careful
after the last one.
I am fine.
Okay?
But what about you?
What's up with you?
Yeah. Where were you, D?
Just ran into
this guy named dame.
Damian.
Who's he?
[Grunting]
Think you might've
checked with me?
And homey older than you.
I'm just trying
to give him a break.
No! This ain't the YMCA.
Look around, Duke.
You see anybody lining up
to get in the ring with Felix?
All I'm saying is, let him spar.
Felix got a fight coming up,
and we have zero bodies.
I mean, absolutely nobody
wants to get in the ring
I know what you doin', Donnie.
You don't owe this dude shit.
Nothing.
But let's spar.
Let's do it.
Felix, Felix, yo. Listen up.
Adonis brought somebody in
for you to spar.
[Adonis] Hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Huh?
- We on.
Lot of young cats in here.
Young man's game.
Don't worry,
Duke's gonna take care of you.
[Dame] We back to ground zero.
Champs gotta start somewhere,
right?
[Duke] All right.
Felix, meet Damian.
He gonna spar with you.
You still remember
how to do that, yeah?
You got this.
[Duke] Felix, stay focused.
Work on timing.
[Tense music playing]
[Thud]
Why's this kid picking on her?
Well, I'm just asking.
Sign.
I'm sorry.
I think...
She probably wants
to get some attention -
hold on. Why is my daughter
in trouble and not her?
She can't protect herself?
Obviously we're concerned
about Amara.
Feeling comfortable here
is important.
Of course.
But we understand fighting
isn't the way to handle things.
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.
Look, we love Amara.
She's an academically
exceptional child...
She's thriving.
She just... fights.
So, you wanna
teach her how to fight?
I didn't think I had to,
at a deaf school like that,
- but maybe I was wrong.
- Wait. [Sighs]
What does that mean,
"at a deaf school like that,"
I mean,
what did you expect, Adonis?
[Adonis] Then she should learn
how to defend herself.
Okay, first of all,
I'm not saying that
she shouldn't know
how to defend herself.
I'm just saying
what that means to me
is different
than what it means to you.
What if she's someplace
she's supposed to be safe,
She won't know
how to protect herself.
Where's that coming from?
Nowhere. It's just a fact.
Okay.
Another fact is that,
I think, as parents,
it's actually our responsibility
to teach her
how to assess her emotions.
So you want Amara, right,
to hold hands with this bully
and start talking
about her feelings?
That's not real life.
Okay, what do you
want her to do?
You want her to never talk about
Not even to us,
and all she can do
Look, I know that you think that
but now that you don't have
an outlet anymore,
you should think about
maybe talking
If not to me, to somebody.
Or, I don't know, D.
Get a hobby.
- Okay, I'll get a hobby.
- Oh, yeah?
Yeah, you.
I'ma go down to the studio.
I'ma start
That's not funny, D.
Look, I know that you think that
but she has got to know why
she wants to fight,
And the only solution
to every problem
Yeah, you're right.
And sometimes it is.
[Doorbell ringing]
[Adonis] All right,
let's just have a good time.
Okay,
I see you made it all right.
Oh, yeah. I just asked him,
"where the black family"
[All chuckling]
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?
There's other ones around.
I ain't see none. Here you go.
Thank you.
- Nice to meet you, Ms. Bianca.
- Pleasure.
You never bought me no flowers.
- Nah. I'm okay.
- No, no, it's all right.
Hey, y'all got a beautiful home.
Hey... dinner time.
[Dame] You got
the see-through floors?
Oh.
Whoa. All right.
Amara.
- Amara?
- [Adonis] Mm-hmm.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
[Bianca] She says, "you too."
[Chuckles]
Ah, hell yeah.
Need water?
Thank you again.
Thank you very much.
[Dame] Dawg,
I still can't get over this.
This square
got him a whole mansion.
Married a... a genuine rock star.
- Yeah, I did.
- Mmm.
How many gold records you got?
- I have a few. [Chuckles]
- [Adonis] She bein' modest.
She bein' real modest.
No, but it's mostly
artists I produce,
- And she produces?
- She does.
Donnie. You punching up.
So, Ms. Producer,
when's your next show?
I don't really
perform like that these days.
Yeah, I took a break,
'cause I was...
I was having some issues
with my hearing on stage.
Now I'm trying to be careful
and preserve
so, I'm producing.
Yeah.
Not any time soon. [Chuckles]
Still hard
to give that part up, though.
Yeah. It's not
the only thing I love,
[Adonis] It's an adjustment...
[Adonis] ...For the both of us.
So, how long
have you known each other?
- [Sighs] I mean...
- We go back. Way back.
We was like...
We was like brothers.
Shared a room for two years
at the Jeff.
Yeah, something like that.
You know how it went.
He went off
The Jeff, right.
Yeah, the group home.
You remember them bedbugs?
I try to forget 'em.
[Chuckling] Yeah.
I can't forget them bugs.
- I'm gonna get her to bed.
- [Adonis] Okay.
- You two stay, catch up.
- [Adonis] Okay.
Oh, invite him
to the label party.
- Definitely will do that.
- Yeah.
I heard that. I'm invited
to the label party.
[Laughing]
- You're invited.
- [Dame] Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you so much for coming.
- Yeah, no doubt.
- My pleasure to meet you.
[Dame] I can't believe
you moved back out here
You used to love
coming out to the hood.
What?
- Domesticated and shit.
- Ah, come on, man.
- [Dame chuckles]
- See what happens
- Yeah, all right, bro.
- Aight?
- The women run this household.
- I just live here.
That's what happens, man.
You get married, a family.
It's crazy.
Pour up.
Can't believe you traded it in
for a monkey suit.
Oh, you know,
a suit has some advantages.
You saying that like I got soft
Like I lost this sneak-attack.
Okay, I see.
The champ's still got
All I'm saying is,
I left boxing,
See,
that's what I'm saying, bro.
I mean, look,
I know you got a ship to run,
but I ain't keep
my stuff together
just to be some punching bag
for some chump.
You feel me?
Don't sleep on Felix. Aight?
He got it the hard way.
He earned it.
I did 18 years
the hard way, bro.
Maybe I ain't make myself clear.
I want a title shot.
Dame...
[Chuckles] I don't know
what you think,
Felix so cold,
what he got to lose?
You think I can snap
my fingers and make you
Ain't that what happened to you?
[Scoffs]
It's like this, bro.
I respect you...
But my clock tickin'.
It's now or never for me.
And I wanna help you,
like I said I would.
But, man,
what you asking me, it's...
It's kinda impossible.
You don't know
what it's like, bro.
All that time in them...
In them walls.
Impossible?
They take your name.
And they give you a number.
That's how it start.
I was the best, though.
Yeah, you were.
I was, bro.
But I never got a chance
to prove that.
Look, all I'm saying, bro, if...
If Apollo creed
could take a chance
Why can't you?
Did you sleep okay?
[Adonis] Mm-hmm.
[Bianca] You were
grinding your teeth.
How was the rest of last night?
[Adonis] Mm...
- It was, uh... it was good.
- Yeah?
Just catching up.
Hey, why didn't you ever tell me
There wasn't a lot to say.
[Bianca] Hmm.
How old were you?
Uh, I was around Amara's age.
You don't wanna talk about it?
It's okay.
- No. [Stammers]
- It's okay.
Nah, it's dame.
You know he asked me
to fight Felix?
- For real?
- Yeah. [Chuckles]
Heavyweight champion
of the world,
So what'd you say?
I said no.
It's impossible, you know?
People wait their whole lives
for a shot like that.
- And he's not even a pro.
- Yeah.
Why does it look like
you're still considering it?
[Felix grunting]
Right. All right.
Work him against the ropes.
Work him.
Stay in front of him, baby.

[Dame] Okay.
[Both grunting]
[Duke]
Okay, baby, come on. Come on.
[Felix] Okay.
Let's go, grandpa.
Not enough.
[Grunting]
Stay focused. Jabs, jabs.
Give it to him.
Work yourself out the clinch.
Let's do it.
- Hey! You keep it clean, huh?
- What was that? Hey.
Yo, man.
What you trying to do,
Walk it off. Little man,
you ain't built like that.
This is my gym, bro.
All right, coz. All right!
[Gym member 1] Get in there.
Hey, hey, hey.
[Gym member 2] Nah.
Get back, Damian. Let him go.
[Adonis] Hey!
What's going on down here?
That was intentional.
- You handle this.
- I am gonna handle this.
[Adonis]
D, talk to me. What happened?
Me doing my job.
Hey, come here, man.
Come on. Hey, hey, hey.
Use your head. Okay?
Use your head. Leave all that
other mess outside.
I told you what I want, D.
And I told you
it was gonna take some time.
All right.
All right? Go take a walk.
Get some air.
Aight?
[Duke] Hey, Adonis.
No... hey, Duke. Calm down.
- This was a mistake.
- I got it under control.
I told you right away
it was a mistake.
- I got it.
- You don't!
You let him come in here
with a chip on his shoulder.
That's exactly...
Well,
don't get quiet now, duke.
It's okay.
Relax. I know, I got you.
I got it under control.
He's telling you
who he is, right?
Believe him.
[Foreboding music playing]
[Rousing music playing]
What you up to, rascal?
Oh, I was...
I was cleaning.
That's not what
uncle Duke told me...
[Sighs]
I don't want to get in trouble.
Mom doesn't want me to fight.
How 'bout
it's our little secret?
Yes!
Want me to show you
all the other stuff?
Yes!
[Mellow music playing]
That's called a straight right.
That's how you
knocked out Wheeler?
Who taught you that?
You.
You watched that fight?
I've watched all your fights.
Show me something else.
Most people think
it's about violence
It's timing and focus and...
Control?
[Both grunting quietly]
Perfect.

Hey, don't worry about them.

[Adonis]
Look at my two killers.

You know I'm always ready.
You don't have to ask.
Okay. Save it for fight night.
We got the venue.
We got the money.
[Bianca] Will you send me

I can't wait to hear them.
We'll talk next week.
It was so nice to meet you.
Congratulations too.
You made it.
- Yep.
- Thank you for coming.
You having fun?
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Good. Me too.
I'm tired of
working the room, but...
It's what you do.
Yeah, sometimes.
- Guess that's what y'all do.
- Look at him over there.
Getting his Don King on.
[Chuckles] Minus the hair.
- Thank god. [Chuckles]
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
You know, that's growth for him.
He used to hate
coming to these things.
So...
- How does it feel?
- What's that?
Having somebody else
sing your song?
Mmm.
It feels good.
I mean,
if it's gotta be anybody,
Yeah, I almost believe you.
[Both chuckle]
How about Donnie?
Think he misses boxing?
No. Not that he tells me.
But would he?
Speaking of,
you know, there's something
Curious what happened
with you two.
Oh, you wanna know
how I got locked up.
Yeah.
Boring story really.
Got into a fight.
I had a few priors.
Pulled a gun.
Donnie was there.
He can tell you.
You know.
Donnie pop off...
And I ain't even saying
dude ain't deserve it, but...
Who is "dude"?
- Okay. Uh...
- [Chuckles]
His name was Leon.
The rest of it, we gonna leave
Ain't really my place.
Feel me?
But it's like you say.
You know, it take work
to look at the past.
- [Security 1] Yo, stop him.
- [Security 2] Drago!
[Security 3]
Hey, hey, get that guy!
- [Crowd screaming]
- [Grunting, groaning]
- [Bones crack]
- [Screams]
[Reporter]
The LAPD took this man,
[Adonis] No.
No, we're not
canceling anything.
He's seeing a specialist
right now.
They're saying...
At least six months.
I know. I know.
But we'll figure it out.
Do not move the date.
All right. All right. Bye.
[Reporter]
High-profile event.
Drago, who's currently
recovering at cedars-Sinai,
suffered a concussion,
as well as multiple fractures
to his right arm and hand.
And his injuries
now throw into doubt
his participation
in next month's...
- [Cell phone ringing]
- [Sighs]
Highly-anticipated title fight
- against Felix Chavez.
- Hello?
Yes,
everything is gonna be fine.
We'll figure it out.
We'll find another fighter.
It's not about just finding
another fighter.
I know, and I understand
your frustrations.
So, what are you gonna do?
He wants to fight Drago.
But we can't wait six months
for him to be cleared.
These windows
don't last forever.
All right, there's one,
maybe two other contenders
There's Ortiz,
and then there's Sporino.
And he's recovering
from his last fight.
Okay, so then who?
I got an idea.
It's risky,
but if we pull it off,
What do you have in mind?
He wants you to fight dame.
Dame?
[Chuckles]
He's not even a real fighter.
He was real enough
when he was sparring with you.
Hey, Felix, people talk.
Champ, he's older than you.
- Huh?
- [Adonis] You're right.
But dame
will fight tooth and nail.
Right now, we gotta think
[Duke sighs]
Oh, you don't like it, huh?
Damian ain't a boxer.
He's fighting the world
and he's trying
No, I don't like it.
I think it'd be a circus.
What he means is
he's gonna put on a show.
We gotta play the cards
that we're dealt.
But the thing here is,
will people come?
Oh, people are gonna show up.
I can promise you that.
Everyone loves
an underdog story.
You know
how many people tuned in
People are still talking
about that fight today.
Champ, listen.
I know it's not
what we promised, okay?
But if it was me, I'd do it.
[In Spanish]
What do you think?
Do you trust him?
Yes, of course.
Ok so let's go.
[In English] Let's do it.
Just let your boy know,
I'ma beat his ass
when I'm in that ring.
Felix, all I want you to do
is your job.
- Hmm?
- Let's get it.

Boy is explosive.

[Crowd cheering]
[Song playing in Spanish]
[Crowd cheering]
[Commentator 2]
This guy is a true product
Chavez made his presence felt
when he stormed onto the scene
with a string
of devastating knockouts.
A proud fighter,
he had one prediction
for this evening's
Victory.
From the Crypto. Com arena,
it's time for the main event

- It's okay.
I got it. Thank you.
[Announcer] Introducing
to you first, on my right...
Making his professional debut,
in an unprecedented attempt
at a world title,
here is the former
golden gloves champion,
"diamond" Damian Anderson.
[Sparse cheering]
And his opponent across the ring
is the defending world champion.
With a record
of 15 wins and one loss,
he has 14 wins
coming by way of knockout.
Introducing
Felix "El Guerrero" Chavez.
[Crowd cheering]
[Referee]
Center ring. Center ring.
Gentlemen,
we went over the rules
[Muffled] I wanna remind you
to protect yourself
Obey my commands.
God bless you both.
[Normal] Touch up.
[Crowd cheering]
Dame needs to start strong.
It will be quick.
Because Felix is a beast.
[Crowd chanting]
Chavez! Chavez!
[Commentator 2]
The bell and the start
here at the Crypto. Com arena.
- Chavez starts out aggressive.
- On the hunt.
Sending a very clear message
to Anderson
But Anderson is keeping
a tight guard.
[Grunting, groaning]
Come on, champ! Let's go.
Don't lay off. Keep that
pressure there, baby.
[Commentator 2]
Chavez paws
but Anderson's showing
good movement.
[Crowd member] Whoo!
[Commentator 2]
Chavez walks him down...
- Oh, wow!
- What an awkward punch.
[Commentator 2]
That looked intentional.
Where all that power go?
It ain't nothing. Let's go.
Hands up, baby. Hands up.
You ain't got nothing
I ain't seen, boy.
[Felix] Okay, grandpa.
No tienes nada.
You soft. You soft.
[Crowd cheering]
[Commentator 2]
Anderson clinches.
Get off the ropes.
[Commentator 2]
Before shelling back up
[Commentator 1]
Dame may be new to us,
but he may have
some tricks in his bag.
- Come on, ref.
- Didn't you see that?
[Bell ringing]
[Commentator 2]
Some dangerous punches
Anderson might need
to freshen up
[Duke] Let's go, Felix.
[In Spanish]
Son! Listen to me.
[In English]
He thinks he's got you.
[In Spanish] Everything's
going to be alright.
[Laura in English]
Stick to the plan.
- I know what I'm doing.
- [Duke] Listen,
you fight the fighter,
I fight the refs.
Don't let this
turn into no kind of brawl.
That's what he wants.
He's trying to agitate you.
- [Felix] I got this.
- [Duke] Let's get out there.
[Trainer] You stole that round.
Don't get caught up...
- Water.
- In their stuff.
It's the first round
and you got bruises
Come on,
you better than that, champ.
You get out there
and fight the fight
- [Bell rings]
- [Commentator 1]
And Chavez is already
back on the attack.
There we go, champ.
[Commentator 2]
Feels like Chavez
[Grunting, groaning]
[Commentator 2] Mamma Mia!
Anderson swinging to separate
Chavez's head
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
- Yo! What is this?
- [Commentator 2]
- You! Time!
- [Commentator 2] The ref needs
to get control
before this gets out of hand.
- Can you continue?
- Yeah, I'm good. Let's go.
- Stay right here.
- [Commentator 1] The only
that cut
is so far below his eye...
- But it's still dangerous.
- Two-point deduction.
It's about time, ref.
Two-point deduction.
Intentional elbow.
Listen, you keep this up
and you're gonna
- Do you understand?
- Right. Right.
- Stay right there.
- [Crowd booing]
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.
- [Commentator 2]
- If anyone was wondering...
What kind of fight
this would be,
it seems like Anderson is out
This is a fight for your life.
[Commentator 1]
Let's hope Chavez can make it
[Commentator 2]
Big right hand
and Chavez
sends Anderson to the corner
Way to finish.
Way to finish strong.
Let me get that mouthpiece.
[Groans]
Keep grinding, champ.
Round after round.
Hey, champ.
You good? Can you still go?
Yeah, I'm good.
Okay, he's good. Let's go.
He said he's good.
Listen, pain is temporary.
- Say it back to me.
- Pain is temporary.
He a bum! Okay?
And you the champ, right?
I'm the champ.
Let's go, champ.
Keep your hands up.
Bring it in.
- [Coach] That's good.
- Let's go. Vamos.
- [Bell rings]
- [Commentator 2]
But it's clearly not the fight
any of us expected.
Stay in it, mijo.
[Commentator 1]
Another shot to that left arm.
Things are starting
to get very ugly.
Chavez is in
some serious trouble.
- I gotta take her, D, okay?
- Okay.
We gotta go.
There's no such thing
as defeat. Let's go.
[Commentator 2]
This is dangerous.
Anderson swinging
like a wrecking ball...
- Move. Move!
- And Chavez
[Speaking Spanish]
[Commentator 2]
Oh, what a shot by Anderson.
Chavez is not getting back up.
[Commentator 1]
Oh, no.
Chavez is down
and appears to be badly hurt.
- [Laura] Felix!
- [Bell dinging]
- [Announcer]
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- [Laura] ¿que Paso?
- Our referee in charge,
Russell Mora, stops the contest.
- [Announcer]
- He is the winner...
By way of spectacular knockout
and he is the new unified
heavyweight champion
"diamond" Damian Anderson.
'Sup, bro? 'Sup, bro?
Right? What?
[Sighs]
[Grunts]
All right, Duke.
We gotta make this right.
- Whatever I can do...
- No.
Ain't no making nothing right.
Ain't no "Duke" nothing.
- I can fix it.
- No!
- [Siren wailing]
- You can't.
You stay away from the gym.
You do that.
[Cell phone beeps]
[Door closes]
[Mary-Anne sighs]
Hey, ma.
[Mary-Anne] How's Felix?
[Washing hands]
He's still at the hospital.
He's stable.
I figured I'd get out of there
and give him some space.
Mm-hmm.
May be smart.
[Adonis grunts, sighs]
What's all this?
They're from Damian.
[Somber music playing]
You kept these from me?
To help you move on, yes, I did.
Mama, how could you?
I was trying to protect you.
Protect me from what?
Damian was my brother.
No, Donnie.
Not in that facility
where you were caged
Did you think that I was gonna
You made him think
I abandoned him.
Do you know
what we went through?
I know who that man was
the two of you beat up.
You know Leon?
[Sighs]
[Sniffles] Yeah.
Then you know Damian
had my back before
Dame treated me more like family
ever did in this house.
And you took that away from me.
None of this would've happened
if it wasn't for you.
You're absolutely right.
None of it.
You hit hard, Donnie.
And you can't see.
There may have been a time
when Damian had your back.
But that's not
what he's doing now.
[Ominous music playing]
[Exhales shakily]
[Hip-hop music
playing on speakers]
Excuse me.
Yo, dame. Dame.
- Hey, man.
- Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me!
[Crowd exclaiming]
[Person] Hold up.
[Music stops]
It's aight. Cool out, bro.
Give me that.
That's what we on?
What's up, Donnie?
You all right?
Man. Nah, nah,
you tell me, bro.
You've been playing me
this whole time.
Guess you did
get them letters, huh?
Why'd you lie to me?
I vouched for you.
I brought you into my home, bro.
I put money up for you.
Put the gloves on your hands
like you asked.
You feel me? [Laughing]
You put the gloves on my hands?
Oh, homey. [Chuckles]
You must be punchy.
[Dame, crowd laughing]
'Cause if memory serves,
you used to carry my gloves.
Get your shit
and get out the gym.
Oh, Donnie, hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.
You think I need you?
No. When I got locked up,
I needed you.
[Chuckling] When I came home,
yeah, bro, I needed you.
But look around, bro.
- I'm the champ! [Laughing]
- [Crowd] Yeah!
And I don't need you
for nothing or... or nothing.
[Laughing]
Who alone now?
Yeah, that's right. Run away.
Run away.
That's the one thing
baby creed.
[Crowd laughing]
[Sighs]
What was that?
- What'd you call me?
- Oh, you mad?
You mad?
Try spending
half your life in a cell
watching somebody else
live your life.
You turned your back on me,
homey.
Hey, but look, don't trip.
[Chuckles]
Hey, come here.
Remember this?
This title?
All this? [Chuckles]
Hey, I'm just getting started,
little brother.
I'm coming for it all.
And what's that
supposed to mean?
Are you threatening me?
[Adonis grunts]
Ain't no threats here, bro.
Just promises here, homey.
[Tense music playing]
Come here. Let's see.
- Get your hands off me.
- Oh, you all right.
Yeah.
Help yourself up for once.
See how it feel.
[Tense music intensifies]
Aloha!
[Sighs]
[Bianca]
Where were you all night?
You didn't get
any of my calls then,
What happened to your eye?
Nothing.
Are you okay?
[Scoffs] Not today.
I ain't got time
Okay. Well, then
what do you have time for?
Let me know.
Because I have been trying
to talk to you for
All right?
Please, can you tell me
what is going on.
Is it me?
No.
It's nothing to do with you.
[Bianca sighs]
Is it about Leon?
What? Who told you that?
Dame.
Is there something else
you wanna tell me?
[Bianca sighs]
D, you have got to
open up at some point.
I don't know what else
to tell you.
What do you want me to say?
What do you wanna hear?
Some sad story?
You're trying
to feel sorry for me
I don't wanna
feel sorry for you!
I wanna know
what is going on with you
There's nothing to talk about!
I don't wanna
I've been trying to forget it!
It's dead! Leave it! Leave it!
Let it lie!
I'm not talking
about that shit no more.
[Bianca sighs]
[Somber music playing]
You figure out your shit, D.
Because what cannot happen
is her seeing you like this.
Do you understand?
[Softly] Yeah.
I love you.
[Leon] Hey, what y'all doing
in there?
Dame! Adonis!
- [Young Adonis] Stop!
- [Leon] Come on! Fight me!
[Young Adonis] Leon, I'm sorry!
[Leon]
Y'all are so tough, huh?
- [Young Adonis] Leon?
- [Leon] Huh?
[Young Adonis]
Don't remember me, do you?
Hey, get off him!
Yeah, you know what it is,
homey.
[Sirens blaring]
- [Young Adonis] Dame!
- Step away from the gun.
- Step away from the gun.
- It's down.
It's down! It's down.
[Breathes deeply]
[Cell phone rings, buzzes]
- Hey, mama.
- [Bianca] Adonis, baby.
You gotta get here right away.
Mama had another stroke.
They're saying
multiple organ failures.
I don't know, D.
I think it's...[Sobs]
I think it might be time
to say goodbye.
[Inhales sharply] Mama?
Mom, I'm sorry.
- What?
- I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it. [Sniffles]
Mm-mmm.
- [Adonis mumbles]
- The day I met you.
Ooh, that face.
Mmm. You were so mad.
Gonna knock everybody out,
one by one. [Chuckles]
Just like your father.
That's why he fought so hard.
You know that, right?
Yeah.
But you... you don't have
to do that.
You can find another way.
Yeah.
[Adonis sniffles]
Yeah, another way.
Another way.
I was angry.
I was so angry
when you left me, Apollo.
Why did you leave me alone?
Adonis.
That's his name.
[Voice shaking]
I'm right here.
He saved me, Apollo.
He helped me to forgive you.
Mom, I'm sorry.
[Crying]
Just tell me what to do.
[Sniffles] Okay?
[Whispers] Adonis.
Adoni...
[Sorrowful music playing]
I'm sorry.
I know.
It's okay.
No, it's not.
It's just...
When dame came back...
All this shit came back too.
I didn't know how to handle it.
But you were always
really good at that.
Feelings.
It comes easy to you.
Doesn't come easy to me.
Doesn't.
I still got a lot of stuff
that I'm trying to figure out,
and I don't always know
how to talk about it either.
You know, Mary-Anne
was the closest thing
I've had to a mom
in a really long time.
I could talk to her.
Now she's gone.
And when I stopped performing,
it was really hard to accept
that my dreams didn't turn out
the way that I imagined
And that still hurts me.
A lot.
But I just made a choice
to try to move on
and be happy
about what I do have.
But it's not easy. [Chuckles]
I just try.
Leon...
Was the dad at the group home
where I lived with dame.
I'm not saying me
and dame were angels.
Okay? But...
No kid deserves
to get beat on like we did.
You feel me?
That night at the liquor store,
And I snapped.
And I hit him.
I kept hitting him.
And his boys jumped on me.
So dame pulled a gun.
Cops pulled up.
We tried to run.
Dame got caught. I got away.
I ran.
You were a kid.
You were scared.
Anybody would've run.
And dame had a gun, Adonis.
That's not on you.
Yeah, but when he went down,
I didn't reach out.
I never called.
I didn't write.
[Stammers]
After a while, it felt easier
to pretend like I forgot.
You know, just...
Act like it never happened.
But that doesn't
make you responsible
You are a good man, Adonis.
I don't know anymore.
You have got to try
to forgive yourself,
so that you can begin
to believe that you deserve
Because you do.
Don't let him destroy
everything you've built.
But, B, he's not gonna stop.

dame is talking about you dirty,
Hey, turn that up.
To anybody who'll listen,
