'My mother always said, never
break anyone's heart.
'So I broke everything else instead.'
'She said, I should always be honest.'
'So, I spent all my life
getting into trouble.'
'But finally, I think
I've met my match.'
He was right here.
Look that way.
Greetings. 
- Bless yöu.
Are yöu...going to settle
for that colored drink?
Or would yöu prefer something stronger?
I would prefer something stronger.
Then, that's where yöu will get it.
Om Namah Shivay!
Cheers! 
- Cheers!
I am Rudra.
Nandini's first cousin.
And yöu? 
- Well, actually, I'm the second cousin.
But I'm closer to her than the first cousin. 
- I see.
Everyone knows that.
There's just one temple
of Lord Brahma in Pushkar.
Why not?
That's because Lord Brahma
committed a big sin..
That's my uncle's Man Friday.
Lallan Tiwari.
He's been raised in this house.
Cheers.
The heroine's here.
The hero's here!
Amazing. Great.
Can I tell yöu something?
- What?
I'm a gate crasher. I wasn't invited.
I got into trouble this morning.
Some gang was chasing me.
I saw the wedding procession and
just joined in to lose them.
I thought as much after
seeing yöur attire.
yöu didn't look like a guest.
Wow, buddy.
She's seriously flirting with yöu.
I just danced with her. I
didn't do anything else.
And who's stopping yöu?
Go ahead.
Brother Rudra. Aunfs calling yöu. 
- Coming.
I'll be back.
Hello.
Name?
What's yöur name?
Raja.
Raja Mishra.
Raja Mishra!
yöu've been ogling me all day!
If I tell my people they'll thrash yöu.
Go ahead, I am not scared.
yöu're not scared?
Do yöu have a girlfriend?
They don't last too long.
- I don't want to either.
Just a minute, hold on.
First tell me yöur name? 
- What for?
To note it down in my list. Number 155.
yöu're a big hunter.
Hunters kill animals.
I awaken the animal inside us.
I see. 
- Right.
All set? 
- Yes.
We have to finish this job in 30 minutes. 
- Yes.
Our plan is, we barge into the house.
..and kill every member of
the family. Do not hesitate.
But, I will kill Parshuram personally.
Look. We won't get this
opportunity again.
Listen! Hey! There's going to
be an attack on this house!
Lallan Tiwari is on his way
here with 10 to 15 gunmen.
What? 
- Rudra!
Listen.
Get in! Rascals, come on!
Go that way.
Brother. 
- Move back!
Lallan! yöu traitor!
Don't run!
Shoot!
Sir, he's my friend.
I invited him. 
- Fine.
But people say he arrived here
with the groom's procession.
What does that mean? 
- Look..
Sir. I'm neither a guest
nor am I family.
Yesterday I..
I got into a fight.
Some gang was after me in a fight.
I mingled with the procession
to lose them and came in.
Fine. Come with us to the station.
SP sir, we should be showing
gratitude to this boy..
..and yöu're arresting him instead?
I've a question, son..
Why risk yöur life for me?
Rudra and I became friends.
yöu risked yöur life for
a friend yöu just made?
And that traitor Lallan..
I raised him in this house
since he was a child!
I have a question, sir.
If Lallan was yöur loyal Man Friday.
Then, why did he do such a thing?
Uttar Pradesh's politics has
wiped out everybody's loyalty.
Now, those who risk
their lives for us..
..are the only loyalists.
I was completely prepared, sir.
Jagjivan's men were with me too.
There was no room for mistake.
Yet, those two boys
outmatched yöur army!
Why are there always two?
What do yöu mean? I didn't get it.
There were two in 'Sholay'
as well, remember?
Stop joking, sir.
I've been humiliated, and yöu're
ranting about 'Sholay'.
Hey loser! yöu said yöu will
eliminate that entire family.
But yöu couldn't even kill a fly!
And yöu got four of my men killed.
Sir, if only it wasn't for these two..
Bipin! 
- Yes.
Come here.
Find them.
Sir, I give yöu my word.
yöu will surely reap marijuana..
..in Parshuram's fields.
If not, yöu can behead me.
Anytime yöu want.
And what will I do with yöur head?
Right, it's useless.
I'm more useful alive.
First, I'll take care
of those two boys.
Sir, I never did hotel management.
But I'll learn.
If yöu prefer, yöu can appoint me
on a temporary basis for a month.
He'll wash dirty plates.
Please father, I'm getting a job.
Couldn't yöu find one earlier..
- No, not to yöu.
Not to yöu.
Yes, sir. I already sent
yöu a bio-data yesterday.
Yes.
Thank yöu, sir.
The police are here.
What's wrong?
This is yöu, right? Come down.
Where will yöu take him?
He's finally just found a job.
Everything will be ruined.
We'll just take him down to the station
and get acquainted, that's all.
Tell them we're on the way.
Why did yöu do it?
yöu were inviting trouble for yöurself.
It was just self defense, nothing more.
Come on, now yöu're in
this mess for good.
Come on.
6...7.. 
- May Allah bless yöu.
Keep it. 
- Bless yöur family and children.
Rudra.
Deliver this parcel on the
way. It's on yöur route.
Why did yöu give him all that money?
Because he needed it more than I.
I can always earn more. 
- I see.
Sit.
Excuse me.
Does Rudra Tripathi work here? 
- Yes.
We're from his village.
That's him, the one riding that bike.
Rudra.
He left. yöu can meet
him here tomorrow.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Get down.
Get down.
If it were up to me, I would've
kept yöu in the zoo, not a jail.
But, they called from up high.
Now go. Go.
Leave!
Here yöu go.
Get lost.
Down there. Come on.
Catch him.
King Yudhishtir was a righteous king.
King Yudhishtin.
yöu can't go out now.
Son, there's trouble brewing.
I'm fasting for yöur well being.
Pray with me for a while.
How long is it going to take?
We fast for the children.
And then, they try to boss us around. 
- Here yöu go.
Hello, uncle. 
- Hello.
He was the eldest of the Pandavas.
Aren't yöu coming?
Here, take my bike and go ahead.
I'll join yöu soon.
Pun“!
I think that bullet
had yöur name on it.
It was meant for me? 
- Yes.
Two men came looking for
yöu after yöu left.
Hello. 
- Hello, Raja?
Call for yöu.
Hello. 
- Hello, Raja. This is Rudra.
Rudra, I was waiting for yöur call.
My phone's shattered.
I'm using my SIM card
in a different phone.
I called to ask, is everything okay? 
- Not at all.
The police attacked me! Did
anything happen with yöu?
Where are yöu?
Uncle, I want this mess to end.
So, we can continue our life normally.
What was normal?
yöu're a postman.
And him. He's looking for a job.
Even if he finds one,
how much can he earn?
Rupees 10,000? 20,000?
So, what do yöu suggest?
I suggest that yöu join my gang. 
- yöur gang?
yöu two are made for this.
Stop it.
How many times will I have
to do it? It's paining.
yöu're educated.
It's difficult to find educated
gangsters these days.
Shut up!
Uncle, this isn't possible.
Please find another way.
Fine, then go to jail? 
- Jail?
I've spent few days in there earlier.
When this matter calms
down, yöu can come out.
At least I'm not cleaning dirty plates. 
- No need to tell anyone.
Tell them I've found a job.
And I've gone to Delhi.
And the ambience here is better.
It's not my fault. 
- No danger.
Even/thing's okay.
Better talk to uncle
and explain to him.
The food's warm, eat it.
What a mess we're in!
What? 
- What a mess we're in!
So, would yöu like some entertainment
to be organized?
Another dance, perhaps?
Should I arrange for that?
Should I send yöu some pictures?
Just leave.
yöur wishes can be fulfilled
for just Rupees 5000.
I said leave.
Life's bad enough and..
There's one man that can
solve yöur problem.
My rate's 2000 rupees.
They're really furious.
I suggest that yöu apologize.
Otherwise.
Will yöu hold on?
This is for yöu.
Yes, sir.
Better take his case, otherwise
he'll get the next date.
Hokum Singh.. 
- Mr. Srivastav.
Yes. 
- This is Rudra and he's Raja.
I'll call yöu back in half an hour.
Thank yöu, sir.
Sit.
Akhand Veer's gang is after us.. 
- Hold on.
Yes, Jaggi.
I know there's an enquiry ongoing.
There was an enquiry against me too.
And I came in here. To follow
High Commands orders.
I became the scapegoat.
I don't want to talk about it.
Don't call me again.
What were yöu saying?
Akhand Veer's men are after us.
Especially, Lallan Tiwari.
I know. Kill those rascals.
Sir, we don't want to resort to
violence. We're not outlaws.
yöu aren't outlaws.
yöu two are...political commandoes.
Just like the army that
protects the country.
Similarly, those running this country.
..need protection as well.
Bureaucrats and politicians,
they also need security.
Do yöu agree?
These days, yöu two are
the talk of the town.
We don't want to be gangsters, sir.
Think about it.
Greetings, sister-in-law.
- Welcome, brother.
Why didn't sister come along?
She's still upset because our daughter just left. 
- Okay..
I apologize... for staging
an attack on yöur home.
That's okay, but yöu
chose the wrong day.
It was my daughter Nandini's wedding.
It wasn't my plan. It
was Lallan Tiwari's.
I know.
Where is Lallan Tiwari?
Bring Lallan out.
Let me go. 
- Come on.
Let me go.
If anything happens to
me, there'll be a riot..
Brother. This man's a
bigger traitor than me!
Get lost.
Take him away. 
- Forgive me..
Where are yöu taking him'? 
- It's my first mistake. Forgive me.
Leave his punishment up to me.
How about a drink now?
It's getting warm.
yöu still like drinking
sugarcane-juice.
I can have it any time of the day.
Before I leave, I would like
to see Lallan's body.
Yes, of course.
Look, that's him.
Few men stopped Divya at college and..
How many were they? 
- Five.
Around five boys.
What were they asking?
yöur whereabouts.
Thank God, her Professor
saw everything.
..otherwise, I wonder what.
I'll see what I can do.
A few men cornered my
sister in her college.
Are the arrangements okay?
ls everyone there?
So, when do we have
to leave? I am ready.
What's going on?
Are yöu going somewhere?
Lallan Tiwari has killed
uncle and his men.
And, we aren't safe either.
Now?
I know where he is.
He's gone hunting in the jungle with
Akhand Veer and his sycophants.
That's where we'll kill him covertly.
What's the point in killing
them silently now?
It's important that everyone known.
..that Raja and Rudra killed them.
This is my personal battle.
Look, they misbehaved with my sister.
The police barged into my home!
They made me run like a
dog. Tried to kill me!
So, this is my fight too.
Well, I can forget...but
my anger won't let me.
Remember.
A rogue Brahmin...is a devil unleashed.
Come back here after
yöu finish the job.
I like what I am seeing.
Stop. Stop. Stop.
Have yöu heard the story of Lord Brahma? 
- Do tell us.
yöu see...He's got just
one temple, in Pushkar.
Because he committed a grave sin..
..for which he was cursed.
How did the tyre burst?
Don't run.
yöu need to tell everyone this story.
My name is Raja Mishra.
And, the other gunman is Rudra.
Raja and Rudra.
From today, we'll be notorious.
Get up.
yöu killed my uncle.
And my friend too.
Now, it's yöur turn. Say goodbye.
This isn't like the movies where yöur
guns have unlimited ammunition.
Recognize him?
He's Lallan the traitor.
So, how are yöu going
to tell this story?
There was once a traitor
called Lallan..
..who betrayed his own benefactor.
Now go, run away.
Get lost.
Where are yöu going?
He's all yöurs.
What are yöu doing, Rudra?
Forgiveness is the best policy.
Forgive me. 
- Hold on. Hold on.
Don't yöu tell that story
about Lord Brahma?
Now, finish that story.
Raja, have yöu lost it?
Now, yöu're going to
hear stories from him?
Of course.
Before he dies I want to know
what Lord Brahma's sin was.
Tell us..
Why don't we pray to Lord Brahma?
Lord Brahma's..
And.. 
- And that's why he was cursed.
What. 
- Shoot him.
Now, pray to Lord Brahma.
Say it aloud... Hail Lord Brahma.
Hail Lord Brahma.
Say it louder, Hail Lord Brahma!
I can't tolerate vulgarity
in religious matters.
Right, buddy.
yöu never said anything wrong.
And, what was that yöu said.
Raja and Rudra the notorious.
That's nice.
Get some rest.
We don't want to rest.
We want to kill Akhand Veer next.
Don't get so impatient.
There's a difference between.
..a gangster and a political commando.
yöu two need political protection.
Hello, brother. 
- That's yöur job.
I am not a politician.
I am a political adviser.
A consultant.
To kill Akhand Veer..
...yöu'll need asylum with
an influential politician.
And I know of just such a politician
who needs yöu two.
Who?
Rambabu Shukla.
Rambabu is the most influential
Minister of the Opposition.
He's highly respected.
He wants to get rid of Minister
Nathuram permanently.
She's getting married.
Nathuram is a big pervert.
He gave Sumer Yadav, the assassin,
a contract to kill him.
And, Sumer's famously known for..
..never missing a target.
That's how accurate his aim was.
Was? ls he dead?
The police are after him.
So he's playing a charade
of pretending to be insane.
He says "I am Radha". 
- What?
Hare Krishna!
Hare Krishna!
Hare Krishna!
Sumer Yadav is delaying
Rambabu's contract.
So if yöu two can kill Nathuram.
Then, Rambabu will give yöu refuge.
And Akhand Veer's all yöurs.
And the entire security
of Uttar Pradesh.
...will be in the palm of yöur hands.
Make a plan.
We don't need a plan to press
the trigger, we need guts.
And we've no dearth of it.
Just arrange for some Holy Water.
Holy Water?
What's this mess outside my house?
Mr. Sharma, when yöu can't
even clean my house.
..how can yöu keep the city clean?
Clean it up. 
- We'll do it now, sir.
It'll be done.
Don't worry.
Watch. 
- Excuse me, sir.
Wait. 
- Sir.
I'm from Delhi, Breaking News TV. 
- Yes.
Yes.
If we can get just 15 minutes
with Nathuram sir..
...we'll interview him for our
TV show 'Walk the Talk'.
And, if yöu want to get anything
done in Delhi, just tell us.
Well, sir. Tell us the point.
..of making a statue of
yöurself and yöur family?
History will remember..
..Nathuram's sacrifices for his state.
Can yöu make a sacrifice? 
- Of course.
I can do anything for the country.
Great.
By the way, where's yöur cameraman?
He's shooting from afar. Wait. 
- Why?
Yes. 
- Bring him back.
The tree's blocking my view.
Sir, we'll head back. 
- Back?
Why back?
yöu see... we passed yöur
sacrificial ground.
What the...
Do one thing...take him
a little further back.
I'll shoot him from a
distance of 100 metres.
What's going on..! 
- I want to break Sumer Yadav's record.
Raja, we can break records later.
Let's just kill him first.
We'll get more chances to make a record. 
- What..!
Just shoot him. 
- This isn't a bad opportunity either.
Raja, what are yöu doing?
Just measure the distance!
- What's going on!
What are yöu doing, Raja? 
- This stick must be around one metre.
Stay there. 
- Yadav shot him from 100 metres.
It'll take us all day to
measure that distance.
Shoot him. 
- No, this'll only take five minutes.
Just count. 
- Raja.
They're firing.
Don't be too loyal for yöur own sake.
For the sanctity of yöur soul. 
- What's this?
Holy Water.
No need to sacrifice yöur
lives for this useless man.
Goodbye.
yöu shot him? Oh no.
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.
We still need to break
Sumer Yadav's record.
Hail Bajrang Bali.
Walk the talk!
yöu two have fantastic coordination.
Ra“ .
Who's it now?
Hello, sir.
Sumer, yöu're truly
good for nothing now.
yöu can pose as Radha forever.
yöu've been replaced.
Soon yöu will hear their names.
Let me tell yöu one thing.
yöu're no longer needed.
My job's done.
Don't ever take this off.
It will protect yöu.
Now yöu've Rambabu Shukla's
permission.
..to kill Akhand Veer Singh.
From today, the entire state
of Uttar Pradesh is yöurs.
The barricade's closed.
It'll take some time.
Stop on the side, under that tree.
Increase that volume.
Make me a glass of sugarcane juice.
Don't forget to squeeze the lime.
Do yöu think we'll be
there in half an hour?
This isn't right.
yöu've shot an unarmed man.
Here, yöu also shoot me.
I am unarmed too.
Shoot.
Shoot!
Rudra, run!
Due to the absence of four
MLA's from the Parliament.
The Reservation Bill
could not be passed..
Madam! We're talking about
the Reservation Bill!
Move aside!
Four MLA's of Ekta Party
have been exposed.
All four were caught with prostitutes.
Raja brother.
Raja brother.
Please include me in yöur gang too.
yöu're an artist, stay that way.
There's a job.
A meeting will be held
in two days time.
..in Sumaria village, next
to Sitapur, at 9pm.
Where Akhand Veer's
marijuana business.
...will be distributed amongst us.
Our job is providing security
to the entire consortium.
yöu two will go as my representatives.
This job is under the supervision
of Mr. Bajaj.
yöu...Two will stay quiet,
behave yöurselves.
Everyone knows our agenda tonight.
Seven months from now..
..there will be elections
in four states.
A year later, there's election
in Uttar Pradesh.
Correct.
I am a businessman, and
a stingy one at that.
We need a friendly government.
Right, Mr. Yadav?
This is why, I convinced five
of my business friends.
..and brought them to this meeting.
..to donate Rupees 100 crores
each to the party fund.
But, this isn't enough.
We need more money.
And this shortage will be covered by..
..Akhand Veer's marijuana business.
Which will be under
my control from today.
And for that I'll need protection.
Which will be provided
by Rambabu Shukla.
yöu all know Mr. Saxena.
The government will support us too.
And in return, we'll donate
20% to the Police fund.
Mr. Saxena!
So, the opposition. 
- Mr. Saxena!
Hey, sir!
Weren't yöu the Inspector
General in Agra?
My good name is Raja Mishra.
He's Rudra Tripathi. 
- Hello.
If we lose this elections.
- Did yöu recognize him?
Wasn't he caught in that
Agra girl's hostel scam?
Yes, he was!
yöu look healthier than before, sir.
yöu're healthier, aren't yöu?
By the way, what are yöu doing here?
We're in-charge of the security here.
What can the police do here?
Hello! Bajaj sir.
Bali] sir!
yöu haven't even introduced
us to anyone here.
yöu two...
yöu two are here only to show yöur
faces silently, not to give advice.
Bajaj sir, we were just. 
- What?
Are we cracking jokes here?
If yöu want to crack jokes,
then do it someplace else.
Stupid monkeys.
He called us monkeys.
I feel insulted too. 
- It's been a long time since I felt like this.
This scoundrel Bajaj.. 
- Go on.
No, yöu go first.
But, I already know what
yöu were going to say.
What?
Exactly what I was going to say.
Take the car to the airport
and pick up my wife.
No, I don't need anyone.
yöu can all go.
Hello. Yes.
Speaking. Fine.
Where is she? 
- In the room.
And the room booked under? 
- My name.
I can never make a mistake
regarding that.
Good.
Sir, here's her medical report.
It's absolutely clear.
Sit.
Nice.
Why do yöu look so worried?
I put my faith in yöu
and called yöu here.
And when I saw yöur
photograph, I knew..
..that, yöu're not just beautiful,
but also smart.
Emotional as well.
Aren't yöu?
Yes, sir. 
- Come closer.
Sir, there's not much I can do.
I can just kiss yöur cheeks.
Will that do?
Ok?
Close yöur eyes.
OK ?
Come on.
Who is it? 
- Room service.
I ordered for it. Papaya. 
- I see.
We'll make a huge film with yöu.
Big one.
yöu two? How dare yöu..
Sir, who are they?
Who are yöu?
I don't know him.
I just came here to ask for
work. Please let me go.
yöu chose the wrong time to
be here. yöu can't leave now.
Come on, Bajaj. Get up.
yöu two are venting out yöur frustrations
about the other night?
Have yöu two lost yöur mind?
Who do yöu think yöu are?
yöu don't boss us around anymore.
So listen carefully, Bajaj.
Don't do anything to humiliate us.
Right now we're only kidnapping yöu.
But if yöu provoke us..
...we'll first beat yöu to a pulp.
then kill yöu.
A hungry Brahmin...is gentle.
A rogue Brahmin...is a devil unleashed.
Hello, Mr. Bajaj. How are yöu?
Hello. Hello. 
- Walk faster. Come on.
Please walk faster.
Come. Come.
Come. 
- Don't misbehave.
Sit.
Please let me go! I promise
I won't tell anyone.
We'll decide what to do with yöu
after this operation's over.
Sit comfortably.
Don't misunderstand us.
We respect women.
Do yöu two know what will happen next?
This operation is personal.
No one else is involved.
So, there's no room for compromise.
Get it.
Make the call.
Don't yöu play cricket. 
- He sponsors the cricket team.
He just plays all games with his mouth.
How did yöu get mixed up with him?
Useless.
Listen, Dibakar.
The Treasury House ruins.
..behind the Residency, Museum House..
Just listen what I am saying!
Put Rupees 50 million in a bag..
..and leave it there in two hours time.
I want to donate it to someone.
Disconnect the line.
yöur silence...could've
cost yöu yöur life.
We're going to collect the money.
No, no. I'll go. 
- Why are yöu always competing?
Fine, yöu go. Go on.
Yes, I will.
Don't hit on the girl.
Are yöu accusing me? 
- Let go.
Are yöu accusing me? 
- Rudra!
Hey Shaukat. 
- Yes, sir.
Get the fertilizer from
the plant nursery.
And get some new rose plants.
Hey, we're in Kaiser Baug.
That's the Police Inspector
General's bungalow.
What do we do? It's
a bad habit of ours.
We like to sin standing
by the gates of Hell.
Hello. Madam. Are yöu enjoying this?
Sorry, I didn't mean to make it louder.
yöu women watch a lot of TV serials.
They are all the same.
What do yöu watch? 
- Me?
We watch the news.
The Animal Channel.
National Geographic.
All news channels are same.
Animals are not the same.
Did yöu know that a crow
never deceives his mate?
They have the same partner
all their life.
I mean... even crows are better
than the likes of him.
I'm telling the truth..
Take the other car.
Are yöu Bengali? 
- Yes.
I love Bengali sweets? 
- Really.
I can make them.
Really? 
- Yes.
That one... What's it called? 
- Rosogulla?
No. They're smaller? 
- 'Sandesh'.
'Oham-cham, Malai cham-cham',
'Lady Ginni' Misti Doi.
Wow. And yöu too. 
- What?
Stop. That's the car.
Did yöu see anyone get down from this car? 
- No.
Ruby Tailors, Rai Bareili.
It's the Rai Bareili gang.
Let's go to Rai Bareili.
Wrong. It all seems wrong.
The yellow leaves falling in autumn.
The blossoming of flowers in monsoon.
The white drops falling
from the black clouds.
Without yöu, even the moonlight
scorches my body.
And the light.
Hold on.. I'm really sorry.
This is the first time
this has happened.
yöu made me very emotional.
What are yöu both doing here?
- Nothing, just some nonsense.
The man yöu spoke to, Bajaj..
..was very smart.
ls it all here? 
- Yes.
He guessed something fishy
from yöur silence.
And his men were there.
Then? 
- Then what? I played them.
Thank God yöu didn't come along? 
- Why?
Otherwise yöu would've just shot them.
And complicated the matter. 
- Right.
Thank God I didn't go.
Come here.
Did yöu "Fire" yet? 
- Yes, But I missed the target.
How do yöu know?
Because, my "Bullets" don't kill..
They awaken the animal inside others.
Fine. Come on.
Heera, take the bag and leave.
I'm leaving yöu two here.. 
- Leaving us?
Why are yöu leaving us? I paid yöu.
Lower yöur voice. 
- I paid yöu..
Quiet.
yöu can leave after an hour.
My man's watching the door.
If yöu leave earlier than
one hour...he'll kill yöu.
Shall we go? 
- Hold on.
Lover-boy.
Go home. yöur mobile's with me.
Buy a new one.
Goodbye.
Listen. 
- Yes.
Can I come with yöu two?
I don't know anyone here.
- yöu can't stay with us.
She didn't ask if she
could stay with us.
And what if I do?
His bullet's hit the target.
There's always danger
in staying with us.
We're dangerous people. 
- That's okay. It'll be fun.
yöu can be a threat to us.
We cannot trust yöu.
If l, as a girl, can trust yöu,
then why can't yöu trust me?
yöu two are such cowards.
We're being decent and yöu're taking offense. 
- Rudra.
Let's take her along.
And if she bungles up I'll
be the first to shoot her..
Get lost.
Hello. 
- Hello.
All okay? 
- Yes, go on.
So, this is our house.
Go, get some rest. yöu must be tired.
No girl's ever entered in here.
I mean...before we did everything in
that department outside the house.
Meaning?
Hello.
I'm going to get some sleep.
I guess yöu will take care of
her sleeping arrangements.
No, no it's not like that...she'll
sleep down here.
I don't care.
I'll stay up there..
I wasn't chosen for such a
big mission for no reason.
yöu didn't use yöur brains.
yöu can't even handle the
security of the bungalow.
Did yöu realize how we came in?
Listen. I let yöu in because
yöu're still a friend.
Otherwise, there would've
been a loud bang.
..and yöur body would be..
...lying on the grass somewhere.
What are yöu doing?
Knead the dough properly. 
- Yes.
Pass me a 'Puri'. 
- It's tasty.
Puri's are called Lucchi's in Bengali.
And, we temper the vegetables
with 5 spices.
That's why it tastes different.
This doesn't taste like regular
curry. It's got a special touch.
Let's change our profession.
Open up a Bengali confectionary.
What do yöu say?
Get up. yöu can't stay here. 
- What did I do?
yöu didn't do anything. yöu just
can't stay here, that's it.
Come on.
- What're yöu doing? Let go.
What're yöu doing, Raja?
Why do yöu always misbehave?
- What are yöu doing?
yöu don't like her. So,
she won't stay here.
Sorry, okay. 
- No, no, it's completely my fault.
I shouldn't have brought her here.
Why? She's nice.
She likes yöu too.
But, yöu don't like her.
Stan the car.
Come on. - Hey...
Hello...
Listen.
yöu just fell head over heels for her.
I thought yöu'd find a girl,
introduce me to her..
..and I would approve of her for yöu.
But that process didn't happen.
So, can't I be a little angry?
yöu sound like a nagging relative.
Listen,
Where are yöu going?
Listen.
No one's going anywhere.
Now, I'm going to treat yöu
to the culinary delicacies.
..of Uttar Pradesh.
I don't want it.
I thought yöu two would
make good friends.
We are all good friends.
Raja, apologize.
And listen...be decent.
L...
I am..
I love yöu!
This is my apology and my promise.
Of love.
It's Rambabu.
What am I hearing?
yöu two kidnapped Bajaj.
Didn't anyone tell yöu how
rudely he behaved with us?
Fine, what's done is done.
He wanted security for
his business, right?
Consider it a demonstration
of our capability.
Remember one thing.
yöu never harm a milch cow.
Just scare her. Get that?
She's refusing.
He's said we need to lay low
for a while. Leave town.
Where can we go?
Delhi? 
- Almost everyone knows us in Delhi.
We can't sit holed up in a room.
How about Mumbai? 
- Yes.
Mumbai's okay.
No one knows us there.
I'll show yöu two around Mumbai.
Just him.
I'll take yöu..
I love yöu too.
First time flying.
Small kids are travelling along too.
This is an experience. 
- yöu call this an experience?
Are yöu more experienced than I am? 
- Fine.
If anything happens.
Sir, that's the adjoining room, like yöu requested. 
- Yes.
And that's the bedroom.
I'll take a look.
Come in, buddy.
I hope yöu booked me a different room.
That's the first thing I did.
Yes, that's more like it.
Have a nice day, sir.
How about we get some food. 
- Get some food?
How about I buy the
entire place for yöu?
Nonsense.
Anything else, sir? 
- No.
Where do yöu hail from? 
- Mumbai, sir.
Vinod Mohite. Maharashtra.
Have yöu heard about Rani Laxmibai? 
- What, sir?
The Queen of Jhansi. 
- What, sir?
She was a Maharashtrian as well.
I didn't know, sir. 
- Yes.
She was born in Benaras.
Benaras? UP?
I didn't know, sir.
A lot of Maharashtrians.
..have been living in Benaras
for the last 300-400 years.
And we all live together like a family.
Keep this. 
- No, sir.
Take it. 
- No, sir. Thank yöu.
Yes, sir. 
- We want to meet, Mr. Mishra.
Raja.
Will yöu keep playing with guns
all day or can we go out?
What's so great about this city? 
- Yeah.
It's our first time here, but it
seems like we've seen it all.
Look!
They're shooting a film there! 
- Where?
Which one? 
- Where? Where?
There!
Yes.
Emraan! 
- Emraan!
Emraan Hashmi. 
- Emraan Hashmi.
Emraan.
Goodnight. Goodnight.
Now, get lost. 
- Fine.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Are yöu going to sleep here?
What will she think?
I have a problem.
Problem?
What's the problem?
Look, when I..
Got it. Go on.
I always take a different girl's name.
Few times...we were at the verge of..
Then?
But the girl got up in a rage and left.
I've no regrets about those who left.
But if she leaves, I'll
be really upset.
It's all because yöu close yöur eyes.
Do it with yöur eyes open.
And.. 
- Look at her.
yöu won't get distracted.
What are yöu saying?
Now go.
And listen. 
- Yes.
Keep yöur eyes open. 
- Yes sir.
Hare Krishna!
Hare Krishna!
Hare Krishna! 
- Brother Sumer.
Hare Krishna! 
- Someone's here to see yöu.
Hare Krishna!
Fantastic.
The feelings fantastic.
..when I devout my entire day to God.
I don't see the negativity
in this world.
It took me time to recognize yöu.
All okay?
I am just like I've always been.
I'm still a man.
But sometimes yöu do get
distracted from God.
And when yöu do, yöu feel
like killing someone.
Raja and Rudra have been distracting
yöu a lot these days.
yöu got me. yöu got me.
Bajaj got me. Very good.
Now, what do yöu expect to do with me?
Rape me?
Look, yöu came looking for
me because yöu need me.
Sumer Yadav, yöu're an exhausted gun.
No one needs yöu.
Raja and Rudra will kill yöu someday.
And I will decide what
day that will be.
I'm a shrewd businessman.
I know how to utilize a torn note.
Do yöu have any virility left in yöu..
..or is it all gone?
Try me, I'm still the man I used to be.
What's the job? 
- Gather around yöur men..
..and bid goodbye to the Lord.
All I need is yöur support
Then, watch how I explode.
Hello. Hello.
Hello. 
- Hello.
How are yöu, Mr. Engineer? 
- All good.
Why don't yöu ask Mr. Shukla to
get his son-in-law promoted.
It's due for two years.
Change yöur name and
yöu'll be promoted.
What is everyone doing here
away from the house?
Brother Rudra said..
Yes. 
- Why did yöu send all the boys here?
Divya's getting engaged. yöu
had to invite everyone.
It's a happy occasion, that
doesn't come too often.
I'm leaving now with Mitali as well.
Mitali.
Let's go.
Sudarshan, get the car..
No, no...don't make that mistake.
No, no, no.
Small things can do impossible feats.
And Marwaris can go a step beyond.
Looking very handsome.
And let me.. 
- Mister.
How about we talk in Hindi.
I'm still a little patriotic at heart.
Do yöu know him?
Where's the girl? 
- What girl?
The one yöu snatched from me.
These days she's been flying around
like a butterﬂy with yöu two.
Find her. Find my star.
Son, come join us for food. 
- Coming.
yöu've a huge collection of books.
What's this?
Keep it back, it's not for yöu.
I can see that.
I only read religious texts.
'Saaya Mein Dhoop.'
What does it mean?
There's no girl here, but
we found this mobile.
She's here. She's right here.
Find her. Find her. 
- Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.
yöu want the money, don't yöu?
I'll give yöu the money,
but let Mitali go.
I will certainly take my money.
But today I've come here
only for pleasure.
First I'll taste that Bengali sweet.
And then...send yöu away.
After that, yöur partner.
A rogue Brahmin...is a devil unleashed.
Deal with him.
Mister, just get it over with..
Forgive me, Bajaj sir.
It was all that Raja's plan.
I really respect yöu.
As much as I respect Bhagat Singh..
Let me show yöu.
Watch.
Watch, sir..
Rascal.
Son. Food.
Please come.
Yes. 
- Raja's just left.
Sumer. Stop.
Raja's coming. 
- Let's take care of both today.
yöu can't even handle one.
If he arrives, these two
will spell trouble for us.
He's alone, we'll kill him. 
- He can take yöu on alone. Get in..
yöu don't understand. 
- yöu will end up dead yöurself.
Listen to me. 
- Let's go.
Let's go.
Stop the car. Stop. 
- What's wrong?
Hurry up. 
- Come on, Sumer.
Hurry UP..
Why yöu.. 
- yöu want to shoot me.
Shoot me. Shoot me.
Listen.
Dare to barge into the
house and kill my target.
Hurry UP...
Then kill me.
Hurry UP...
Kill me.
I'll call Raja! 
- No.
There comes my friend. 
- Raja.
Who was it? 
- It was Bajaj, there was another man with him.
..whose voice I couldn't recognise. 
- They fled.
Heera!
How was Divya's engagement?
- Forget that.
Heera! Call the ambulance!
I'm leaving yöu, buddy.
It was the best time of my life with yöu. 
- What?
How can yöu leave me?
No!
Long live Rudra.
Long live Rudra.
l, Raja Mishra, son
of Ramsharan Mishra..
..caste Shandilya, district Azamgarh..
..swear to avenge yöur death,
before sunset tomorrow.
Otherwise, I'll burn myself alive.
Get yöurself arrested
for minor felonies.
Stay behind bars.
The situation isn't safe outside.
What about yöu?
I'll take care of this situation.
We won't let yöu go alone.. 
- I must!
What have yöu decided?
To take care of Bajaj, what else?
yöur anger is justified. But, not yet.
Then, when?
This is personal.
There's no politics in this.
There was another man who
helped Bajaj kill Rudra.
I am looking for him too.
Going against Bajaj means going
against the entire system.
The system, or yöu?
I've always supported yöu.
So ask the system to be careful.
Because I've lost my mind.
And I will strangle the whole system.
I'm not going to listen to anyone.
This is going to be big.
Now it is Raja's turn. 
- Move the car.
I'll take care of him for good.
What's going on, Shamsher?
Hey idiots, get out.
Who is it? 
- How are yöu, Bajaj?
Brother, spare me some alms. 
- Get lost.
Have yöu lost yöur mind?
Stop, Raja. Stop.
Look.
No, Raja.
Look, Raja. Everyone has seen yöu.
yöu cannot escape. 
- I don't want to escape.
Raja.
Look, Raja. yöu cannot escape.
Look, Raja. No, Raja.
Brother!
Here yöu go.
Hey...look. No. No.
The gun should disappear.
- It'll be done.
yöu made a big mistake by killing
the artist inside yöu.
Keep in touch. 
- Yes.
The businessman Jatin Bajaj, who
was also called the 'Kuber'..
..was murdered in broad daylight
at Hazrathganj Square.
This incident has sent waves
through the political world.
Even after the continuous investigations
by the police.
The people of Lucknow refuse
to speak about this murder.
Mitali, I told yöu.
Go back to Kolkata, back home.
If I had wanted to leave, I would
have done it a long time ago.
What's this?
This is mine.
From today. 
- Have yöu lost yöur mind?
If anything could measure our anger..
Then we would be at
the same temperature.
Don't distance me from yöurself.
I cannot replace our friend Rudra.
But I will do anything for
yöu, at any time yöu want.
I'm here to talk to
yöu, not arrest yöu.
yöu killed Bajaj. In public.
People are so scared of yöu..
..that no one's ready
to testify against yöu
They aren't scared. They respect me.
Whatever it is.
I want yöu to lay low for a while.
Lay low? yöu mean run away.
If yöu lay low everyone will
think yöu've calmed down.
Otherwise, Bajaj has many well wishers.
And they are all furious for revenge.
Are yöu threatening me?
Because let me make it clear,
Inspector General sir.
Threats don't scare me.
And I'm a Brahmin.
I was born intelligent.
Tell Bajafs well wishers to
stay in mourning for him.
And not to get too furious.
Otherwise, all their families
will be mourning for them.
If yöu leave, it will save the
reputation of the police.
I am not going anywhere!
If yöu value yöur reputation,
then arrest me.
Otherwise, employ a sharp shooter.
..that has the guts to aim at me.
Fine. Rambabuji sent me to talk to yöu.
I'll tell him that yöu've
lost yöur mind.
Tell him...l lost my brother.
And our tradition is
'an eye for an eye'.
We don't follow corporate culture.
And cover up our losses
in the next deal.
The one who makes a mistake has to pay.
And I won't spare him
till the next deal.
That's my culture.
He isn't listening to me.
- yöu try explaining to him.
Mr. Tripathi, let me talk to him. 
- Let's go.
Bless yöu.
We're here to tell yöu that.
..we won't live for too long.
If anything happens to yöu..
Son. No one dares to face us
because they're scared of yöu.
But everyone's looking for a..
What if something happens to yöu?
yöu two have made a lot of enemies.
They won't leave us alone.
If yöu want to see us alive,
then leave town for some time.
Look, uncle.. 
- Look, son.
Think about Rudra's family.
Now, they are yöur responsibility.
Come with me to Kolkata.
Sister.
She went to Mumbai to become a heroine.
Go. 
- Go.
We want to go this way.
Fine, go. 
- Go.
No, it's not possible. Acting is fine.
We encourage talent like
any other Bengali family.
But marrying outside the
community... Impossible!
Pardon me.. 
- Mom.
It's okay.
What do yöu do? 
- I work in a bank.
Assistant Manager.
And salary? 
- A lot.
yöu want to know his
salary? Bad manners!
yöu brought a stranger to this
house without informing us.
Isn't that bad manners?
Uncle, why don't yöu say something?
Aren't yöu a communist?
That's surprising.
What has being a communist
got to do with it?
A communist is a communist.
Family's family.
He'll be our son-in-law.
I can tell from the face.
So what if he isn't Bengali. 
- Greetings.
My granddaughter will marry only him.
Mother, what are yöu doing?
He's my son-in-law. So handsome.
I respect him too.
That's why I am quiet.
Everyone please request Rambabu..
...to stop supporting Raja Mishra!
Bajaj's death has sent waves through
the business community.
Look, Bajaj supported us and yöu too.
Now that he's dead, how am I..
..going to contest in the
elections, and how are yöu?
Raja doesn't just have
my support alone.
All the Brahmins and Muslims.
..of the state support him too.
yöungsters idolize him as their hero.
Look.. 
- Some decisions should be taken.
..beyond loss and gain, Balram Yadav.
Fine. Fine. yöu're taking me lightly.
..so yöu can talk to Srivastav.
Only he knows where Bajafs money is.
Talk to him.
Stan the connection, son. Open it.
Hello, Srivastav sir.
This will be our last conversation.
..if yöu don't do something
about Raja Mishra!
No one will get a penny
for the election.
And, yöu can decide the outcome
with a wrestling match.
And look, don't try to use force on me.
Because, I know the secrets
of every VIP in this country.
And the day I expose them.
President's Emergency Rule will
be applied in the country.
I've no news about Raja.
As soon as I find out
I'll send him to yöu.
He'll apologise to yöu.
Apologise?
This isn't a childish
mistake, Rambabuji.
Kuber's been murdered.
Do yöu understand the
meaning of 'Kuber'?
'The God of wealth'. Bajaj.
yöu need to decide how
to deal with Raja.
I'll read the news in the papers
and release yöur election funds.
Goodnight.
At this age, I cannot
change profession.
Better do the right thing.
Come on, get the car.
Inspector General sir. 
- Yes.
Why don't yöu join politics
after retirement?
Take advantage of..
..finishing off an outlaw
gangster like Raja Mishra
Look, all our betterment lies in it.
Find a fearless man..
..who can silence Raja quietly.
Come on. Come on down.
When are yöu bringing
sister-in-law home?
I'm going to my in-laws next week.
I'll see how she's feeling.
In two months, I'll be
transferred from ltawa.
I'll be going to London on deputation.
Give me some good news before I go, Darshan Singh. 
- Yes.
How much further do we have to go?
Hail Bhawani!
Hail Bhawani!
Now yöu know the hardships
we have to face.
yöu had to face a little of it too.
Did yöu feel it? 
- Yes, I did.
What are yöur conditions
for surrendering?
Firstly, yöu disrespect me..
..and on top of that are
trying to boss me around?
I hope yöu know yöu're
in Chambal territory.
Police officers go missing here often.
yöu're upset.
So, what are yöur conditions?
First, my entire gang will
stay in the jail together.
OK?
And second, our children back home..
...should get free education.
Anything else?
And one day before we surrender..
..Bipasha Basu will perform
here for us. Right?
That will be fantastic, chief. 
- Bipasha Basu?
We're making a big sacrifice.
Can't we have some fun?
Sir, the government will accept
all yöur conditions.
But if Bipasha doesn't agree,
we cannot force her.
Try. Don't try to be a spoil-span.
We'll try, sir.
Call us back after two days.
Let's go, Darshan. 
- Hey.
He can't leave.
He'll stay here. And, Bipasha's
going to dance here.
If that doesn't happen..
Then a week later yöu can
prepare for his funeral.
No, no, sir... I cannot stay here.
Blindfold him.
Where are yöu going, sir?
I'll be back. 
- Sir, please don't leave me.
Sir, please don't leave me here. 
- Hey. Stop.
Sir.. 
- Stop.
Stay with us.
Sir, I cannot stay here.
My wife's in labor. I cannot stay here.
yöu aren't delivering the child.
Don't worry. We won't
kill yöu before a week.
Can I take a leak?
yöu can consider one
of them as Bipasha..
..and have some fun in jail. Let's go.
Come on, enough singing.
yöu're an insult to renegades.
The real renegades used to
be back in the old days.
Madho Singh. Malkhan Singh. 
- Paan Singh.
I've a question for Arun Singh sir.
Single-handed.. 
- Come, Darshan.
Come on.
So, Mr. Arun.
yöu single-handedly and in one day..
..how did yöu eliminate
such a dangerous gang?
Because I fight with emotions,
not strength.
Take America for instance.
They're so strong.
But did they ever win?
Because, on the other side is emotions.
That's fine, Arun Singh sir, but.
Please handle them. 
- Okay, okay.
Were yöu present there? 
- Yes, I was present there myself.
Yes, sir. 
- We need yöu in Lucknow.
It's important.
I'll be there tomorrow.
Not just for a day or two.
We'll have to get yöu transferred here.
I've already passed the orders.
If yöu've already passed the orders
then I'll be there soon.
Good news, sir.
In two months, I'm going
to London on deputation.
Sir, just two minutes. 
- I'm sure..
..yöu will finish this job before that.
Sir, we're losing time.
We need to file a report.
Just give me a minute, sir.
Sir, what's yöur message for the yöuth?
Look, yöu're awakening my emotions now.
If I slap yöu, yöu'll be the front
news for the rest of yöur life.
Do yöu want a message for the yöuth?
Do yöu want a message for the yöuth?
Sorry. 
- Get lost.
A demon warrior is afoot here..
..that only a brave warrior
like yöu can kill.
Who?
Raja Mishra.
Then, I better pay my family a visit?
Family? 
- Yes. Allahabad.
Why?
yöu see, when it becomes necessary
to commit a sin..
Then one should ask
for forgiveness first.
He's really smart.
He's got yöur mom on his side.
He's really sly. 
- Enough, dad.
Don't utter any more
nonsense about Raja?
Boys look better if they're bad boys.
It's better for this era.
Take a look at yöurself.
So, I'm unfit for this world
because I am an honest man!
I can't understand what yöu're saying.
Nonsense.
I guess yöu couldn't figure me out yet.
Whether I am good or bad.
My Mitali's fate would
not be that unfortunate.
I don't know.
yöu borrowed money from us.
And promised to return it in 15 days. 
- Slowly.
Slowly, brother. 
- But it's been more than 20 days.
..and I haven't received
a single penny.
Don't just stand here.
Arrange for the money.
If we don't get the money today.
...we'll take yöur wife's jewellery.
He?..
Listen.
Here.
Pay him.
Pay him.
Why do yöu interfere?
yöu can see I was talking to him?
The daughter's back home.
He must be her guest.
What did yöu say?
What did yöu just say?
What did yöu just say
about my daughter?
I said yöur daughter's
really beautiful.
She's back home.
Now, yöu don't need to
borrow any more money.
Hey...
Go on, who threw the first punch.
He did, sir. Sir, he did.
Hey...boy!
How are yöu two related?
What did yöu say? 
- yöu aren't Bengali?
No. I am not a Bengali.
But, yöu police are all the
same in the entire country.
Ask him to step out with me.
Sir. He's trying to bribe yöu. Bribe.
Bribe won't work. Bribe won't work.
Sir. Please listen to me.
This is Bengal. No corruption.
India is a country of migrants.
The Opposition that
rant about Hinduism.
Greetings. 
- Where are yöu?
Ask someone to call Bada Bazaar
police station, Kolkata.
Kolkata? 
- They arrested me for no reason.
When are yöu coming back? 
- Soon.
Still.. 
- When I come back, the temperature will rise.
Everyone will get to know.
Hello, sir.
Okay, sir. Okay.
Let's go. 
- I see.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Why didn't yöu tell me who yöu work for earlier? 
- It's okay.
How about a cold drink? 
- No.
Fine. How about some tea or coffee? 
- No, thank yöu.
yöu will have to drink some
mineral water, I insist.
No, it's okay.
Pachori.
Call Balwan.
Yadav. Raja is in Kolkata, but
he can return at any time.
Very good.
Inspector General sir. 
- Yes, sir.
Be alert. Raja can come back any time. 
- Yes.
Glory to.. 
- Sumer Yadav!
Sumer Yadav! 
- Stop!
Stop.
Glory to.. 
- Greetings to all of yöu.
Before yöu start asking questions.
...I would like to say,
I'm surrendering myself.
Because, my life's in danger.
There are witnesses against yöu..
..in the CMO murder case.
yöu shouldn't say such things.
..about great personalities, son.
He's here to create history.
He's surrendering himself,
didn't yöu hear?
Bring him here.
The court's right here.
Bring him in front of me.. 
- Raja!
Who's stopping yöu?
That's the voice I heard that day.
Raja! This is the man that
was with Bajaj that day.
I am not crazy.
I am a religious man, I read religious texts. 
- Sumer Yadav!
He must have fired the
shot that killed Rudra.
Bajaj just gave the orders.
'I am going back, Mitali.'
'This happiness is futile, because..'
'..the murderer of my friend is..'
'..is still hiding somewhere
and smiling.'
'But I promise...l will meet
Sumer Yadav just once.'
'And we'll meet again soon.'
'Wait for me.'
Yes, is everything okay?
I'm in Lucknow.
Where are yöu going to stay?
Hello. 
- Hello.
Shall we go home? 
- Not home. It's dangerous.
As long as we don't kill Sumer Yadav.
I don't want to get entangled
in any petty trouble.
It's not strong.
It will blow-up in a single shot.
Hello.
Hello, brother.
This is yöur home.
yöu can stay here as long as yöu like.
Downstairs is my family and
up here, is yöur abode.
yöu won't face any problem.
Do yöu visit the temple?
- Every Tuesday.
As long as I'm here,
every day's a Tuesday.
From home to temple, and back.
No other work will happen.. 
- Yes.
Listen. I don't want to get caught
for anything foolish yöu do.
Understand? 
- Yes.
I'm planning an operation.
And I will leave as soon as it's done.
I'll never forget this favor.
If the yöuth of Uttar Pradesh
protest against Raja's death..
Then it will be yöur
job to contain them.
In return, I'll nominate.
..six of my weakest politicians
to stand against yöu.
After Raja's death, the people of
Uttar Pradesh won't listen to me.
Listen to me..
Politics and prostitution
are really old professions.
And both include maintaining
peace, carefully.
The shooter yöu're calling
to kill Raja..
...will also have to sacrifice
his life later.
ls that Raja's file or erotic
stories that yöu're reading?
Raja and Rudra's stories
should be published, sir.
They have such a colourful past.
But, one thing is clear.
They couldn't have done
all this without.
...the support of someone powerful.
Who's supponing Raja?
Rambabu Shukla.
He's a senior Minister.
Sir, if yöu want Raja to
be arrested or finished..
..then understand that from now
on I am the senior most here.
I don't care what yöu've decided..
But I'll release the election funds..
...only after Raja's dead.
Raja's not the only one who will die..
..many others will lose their lives.
I don't care.
One of them will be yöur men. 
- Who?
Sumer Yadav.
He's in yöur jail.
Raja will come out of hiding
when he's out in the open.
yöu couldn't control yöurself either.
yöu're here to see the match too.
I am not here to see the match.
I am not interested.
I am here to warn yöu.
- Why? What's wrong?
Raja is in Lucknow.
What?
I heard that yöu're the
only thing on his mind.
So, what can he do?
I am in jail.
He's been in this jail for a long time.
We don't know who's working for him.
Catch him. Catch him. 
- Catch him.
Hold his leg. Catch him.
Come. Come. Come.
Come. Come. Come.
Come. Come. Come.
Come. Come. Come.
Come. Come. Come.
Come. Come. Come.
Come. Come. Come.
What the... Who was it?
Who was it? Who was it?
Who tried to kill me?
Who was it?
Greetings. 
- Bless yöu.
There's toothpaste. Oil. And
four packets of biscuit.
That's what yöur family sent for yöu.
Stop.
Stop. Stop.
Get lost.
Who sent yöu in jail? 
- What are yöu doing, Sumer?
He's under trial. 
- Who sent yöu?
He's been sent to jail today.
How can he be yöur enemy?
He was staring at me.
yöu're the superstar of this jail.
He must be a fan following yöu around.
Right, I am being followed
around a lot.
I won't spare anyone.
Get back to work.
People are questioning yöur courage.
They think yöu're scared.
Sir... 
- Media.
People vote only for those
who are media-friendly.
Go out of the jail.
Once yöu do, Raja will come after yöu.
yöu can finish him off
with Munna's help.
ls this why yöu called me here?
yöu cannot kill Raja alone.
For that, yöu need a intelligent.
..and strong ally like Sumer Yadav.
Get that.
I've arranged for yöur bail.
Sumer Yadav.
Brother Sumer, greetings. 
- Bless yöu.
Sumer Yadav.
Isn't yöur life in danger now?
I am fearless now.
Now, I'm connected with
the Lord. Glory to..
Hold on, sir. 
- Get that.
Sir, have yöu been given
bail or acquitted.
..of such grave crimes.
yöu will have to tell us.
yöu will have to tell the media, sir.
yöu just saw Sumer Yadav
has been granted bail..
..and he has left.
Let's go.
How are yöu? 
- Even/thing's fine.
All okay. 
- Greetings, chief.
Welcome everyone to the
cycle competition.
This year Suresh from
our neighborhood..
Make a 'Paan' for me.
What are yöu making? 
- Here.
yöu imbecile.
Make it very spicy.
Beautiful.
Its too sharp.
Want one?
Have it.
Sumer's really smart.
He finishes a job and
hides in the temple.
I've been following him for three days.
He goes at least twice.
Sometimes by day, sometimes at night.
Night's best, brother. 
- No.
We'll kill him during day.
It's very crowded during the day.
I will let everyone know..
..that I avenged Rudra's death.
So what if it's crowded.
That's where I'm going to kill him.
It's the tradition of Raghu clan.
Lay down yöur life, but
never break a vow.
See..
I'll slap yöu.
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
Greetings!...  
- Greetings!...
Stop. Stop.
I'll slap yöu.
Move.
I had to kill Rudra.
yöu know this happens
in our profession..
Just forgive me.
I swear, I will never
forget this favor.
I want to kill yöu every
day, Sumer Yadav.
Three times a day.
Arrange for something like that.
And I'll be indebted to yöu forever.
Are yöu completely dead?
Who are yöu?
yöu're way too excited on this matter.
How much did Sumer Yadav pay yöu?
I'm still on the government pay list.
The name's Arun Singh Munna.
Chambars watch guard.
- So, yöu recognized me.
Look. I did what I had to.
yöu can shoot me now if yöu like.
I won't kill yöu. yöu're
a fantastic guy.
Look. Either yöu let
me go, or fight me.
Look, there he is.
Rambabuji, except for the Prime
Minister and President.
Ministers like us, are not
too secure as we grow old.
Neither the family nor
the Party supports us.
The only thing that
supports us is money!
Now all the industrialists
will run away.
Raja Mishra is.. 
- What can I do?!
Sir..
l...
Yöur aim was bad.
- Sir, I tried.
That's why he escaped.
He has become even more popular
after killing Sumer Yadav.
Just once, tell me.. 
- I don't know where Raja is.
Rambabuji, please.
Just find out once...where Raja is.
Did yöu call them?
No, sir. I didn't. 
- Stop.
Excuse me. 
- yöu fool.
They are from the press.
Let them through.
How are yöu? 
- It's yöur grace.
It's okay, son. 
- Hello, brother.
Raja wants to talk to yöu.
Here.
Hello. 
- Greetings sir.
Where are yöu? 
- Do yöu want to know that.
..or tell the world about it? 
- Meaning?
I mean, only yöu knew that
I was back in the city.
So how did Sumer Yadav
get police protection?
And from that was Chambal
watch guard, Arun Singh.
Anyway, I took my revenge.
And the police couldn't
do anything about it.
I just called to tell
yöu that I am leaving.
To start a new life.
New address...new name, new profession.
And if I find out, that
yöu were responsible.
..for sending that police
officer after me..
Then I'll come back in this form.
And spread havoc!
And I won't spare yöu either.
I never saw yöu in Raja's gang before.
He met me a little later.
By the way, these days
he trusts me the most.
yöu're being loyal to someone..
..who doesn't have too long to live.
Meaning?
I mean...this is the reward
for being loyal..
..to the Lord's devotion and politics.
Come here. 
- Yes.
Are yöu coming? 
- Yes.
Look after yöurself.
Here's yöur passport
Ok?
Please see if it is right or wrong
I don't always know what's
right or wrong.
But whatever's happening now is right.
All of yöu head back to yöur villages.
Thank yöu for yöur support brother.
And yöu, Mr. Artist.
yöu won my heart. 
- Don't embarrass me.
yöur gun? 
- I don't need it anymore.
Why is he coming this way?
No one can narrate yöur story
better than me, Raja.
Come on, get out of here.
The investigation is going on..
..and the police have been
posted here since morning.
These images are of a Lucknow highway..
...where gangster Raja
Mishra is believed.
..to have died in a car bomb.
If Raja Mishra's death...
Where are yöu? At the airport?
Yes, sir. I'm heading to Delhi.
Call me when yöu come back from Delhi.
I'll receive yöu personally.
What's the occasion, sir?
The government has allotted
yöu a piece of land.
Sir, yöu're too kind..
I'll take yöu to see the land myself.
Okay, sir, definitely.
Yes, sir.
In two days time, I will take
Munna to show him the land.
He's a smart officer.
We'll need to be careful.
Make arrangements for yöurself.
Thank yöu.
Good afternoon, Ma'am.
'Mr. Artist. yöu won my heart.'
'yöu're embarrassing me.'
'yöur gun'? 
- I don't need it anymore. '
'So...Rambabu took yöu
under his wing too.'
'And what did he ask in return?'
'Mr. Artist, Raja can forgive most
mistakes, but not betrayal.'
'This is the reward for being loyaL.
...to devotion and politics.'
'From today, yöu're responsible.'
'..for the security of this country.'
'When yöu leave for the airport.'
'..Arun Singh will kill
yöu on the way.'
'And then...l will kill Arun Singh.'
'That's the plan.'
My yöunger brother, Param.
- Hello, sister-in-law.
The gun that he keeps waving around..
'The government yöu're
risking yöur life for..'
'..is humiliating yöur integrity.'
'yöu will kill me, and the
public will get enraged.'
'And to calm them down, yöur
life will be sacrificed.'
'My job was to finish Raja.'
'And Raja will be finished.'
'It's not safe for yöu here.'
'Come with us to Malaysia.'
'Brother, yöu spared me.'
'Brother, I will never forget yöu..'
'It's not me, the Lord's doing it all.'
'Why is he coming this way?'
This air travel is always the
most challenging for me!
Why are yöu holding my hand?
Sir, please be seated.
Don't move, sir. Please. 
- I'm scared, need a window seat.
Now yöu make my fears go away.
What the...
