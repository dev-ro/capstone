Welcome, Mr. Shamsher Singh.
It was really sad to hearabout your dad's sudden demise.
He was a nice man.
Sad...
Sad for what, Mr. Shamsher.
My dad didn't do anythingunusual by dying.
You die...when you got to die.
Please, sit down.
You've raised the securitya notch on the base, Balwinder.
Even the guards are alert.
They even frisked me,and that too on my own base.
No need to feel bad, Mr. Shamsher.
These people even friskme when I come here.
And as for this base...
...you still own this place.
But after you leave...
...this entire property...
...and infrastructure will be mine.
I am all ears, Ballu.
Go on.
From today,I'll take 20% share of the profits.
And, as a token of my father's20 years of loyal service...
...you'll have to transferthis entire property to me.
And, what if I refuse.
Then be prepared to facelosses worth millions of dollars.
You supply arms to allthe biggest countries in the world.
And I know, as well as you...
...how many are licensed,and how many are unlicensed?
I just have to leak thisinformation to those countries.
And they will immediately...
...cancel your ordersworth millions of dollars.
You've completely cornered me, Ballu.
I can't let my ego take over andlet your greed shut down my business.
Give me the property papers,I'll sign them.
Nice pen!
Pier Crown!
Price, only $20,000/-
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Keep it.
You know, Mr. Shamsher Singh.
I never imagined youwould be convinced so easily.
I thought you'll first get angry.
And then, I will haveto convince you in my own way.
But you just agreed.
My older brother used to say.
Any decision when taken ina fit of rage is never profitable.
So first I took a decision...
...and now I am getting angry.
Very angry!
There's a saying back in my hometown,in Handia.
"When the lion hunts his prey,he feeds on it first..."
"...then the vulturesand the scavengers."
"The worms and insectsfeeds on the leftovers."
And to me,you're smaller than an insect.
Shamsher Singh!
Maybe you can control your anger...
...but not me.
And, don't forget that you're unarmed.
You might want toguarantee your safe return.
Calm down. Calm down.
Those toys which your menare holding are manufactured by me.
And as for my safe return...
...maybe you're not aware that,I never do anything without insurance.
Don't try to touch the pen.
It's touch sensitive.
This $20,000 pen is lacedwith 20 grams of gelatin.
And the detonator's in my hand.
Tell your men...
...don't even breathe heavily,and don't move a muscle.
If I press this...
...it will trigger a smallexplosion near your heart.
"Poof!"
And it will all be over.
I warned you, Ballu...
...don't mess with this man.
He's dangerous.
For God's sake, do something.
- Hello, sir.- Cyrus...
Now you will look after the base.
Thank you, sir.
Give the phone to Balwinder.
Hello.
I forgot to mentiona small detail, Ballu.
The deal is off.
'This is Shamsher Singh.'
'He owns the biggest armsfactory on Al Shifa island.'
'25 years ago,he was accused of manufacturing...'
'...and supplying illegalarms in his hometown Handia.'
'But he escaped withhis family to this island...'
'...before he could be arrested.'
'Now he operates from here.'
'This is Raghuvendra Sinha,aka Raghu.'

'This is Rana Singha.Shamsher Singh's arch enemy.'
'He's got his hands in everyillegal business on this planet.'
'He's Powerful...
Evil...
...and Dangerous.'
'Sanjana...Shamsher Singh's only daughter.'
'Her passion is extreme sports.'
'Also highly trained inthree forms of martial arts.'
'She has got sharp moves,and a sharper mind.'
'She's bold,smart, and very ambitious.'
'This is Sanjana's twin-brother,Suraj Singh.'
'He flies into a rage,faster than his cars.'
'Which is why his social life completelydepends on the money he splurges.'
'He has a specialty.'
'He acts first and thinks later.'
'This is Yash...'

- Target in sight.- Good.
Make sure you get him this time.
That's better. You don't worry.
The consignment willreach you on time.
Raghu, we're in trouble.
They are Rana's men!
Stop! Stop!
Move, Raghu!
Get me closer! Get me closer!
Go left. Left! Left! Left!
Rana sent you, didn't he?
Didn't he?
Yes, Raghu. Tell me.
There's been an assassinationattempt on your dad, Suraj.
What?
- How is dad?- Now don't worry.
He's safe.
He's with his medical team.
Luckily the bulletjust grazed his shoulder.
Tell me who did this.
Who else can it be other than Rana?
Rana is a dead man.
What was Suraj saying?
He sounded really angry.
I think he's goingto Rana's warehouse.
That boy's an idiot.
I am sure Sanjana'salso gone with him.
Find out...
...where's Sikander.
Sikander's been already informed.
This always came to myaide when I was in trouble.
And it's one of theclosest thing to my heart.
My lucky mascot.
And now it's yours.
Really?
Thank you.
She's beautiful.
Keep it.
Sexy uncle,you must be feeling a little jealous.
Actually,he must be feeling very jealous.
Not jealous, I am happy.
I had my eyes on it.
But you deserve it.
Thank you.
Raghu,...
...tell Suraj and Sanjanato meet me in my den.
And find out how farour lawyer has reached?
Welcome, my lawyer friend. Welcome.
- Hello, sir.- Hello.
- I hope you're okay.- Nothing, just a...scratch.
Did you recognize him?He's our family lawyer.
- Srikant Verma.- Hello.
- Hi, sir.- Hello.
Come.
Where do you think you two are going?Sit down.
He's here especially for you two.
- Any tea/coffee, Srikant?- No.
Thank you, sir.
Then shoot, Lawyer.
A few weeks ago,you two celebrated your 25th birthday.
So I am here to executeyour mother's will.
Ohhh...
Nice.
Your mother, Sumitra Devi...
...divided her propertyof Al Shifa in two parts.
She gave 50% of thisproperty to Sikander...
...which I already transferredin his name a few years ago.
And she transferred 50% to you two...
...and, the time has come to execute it.
25% each.
So here's the Will...
...and, I'll need yoursignatures here, son.
- Do I sign here?- Yes.
Congratulations, children.
Now you two are 50%partners of this property.
Okay sir, I'll take your leave.
See you soon.
- Thank you, sir.- See you, sir.
- Bye.- Bye.
What was this, bro?
Like seriously?
We get 25% each,while he gets 50.
Really dad.
Even mom treated us the same wayyou've have been treating us.
Are we your children, or is he?
You are my children,...
...and so is he.
Your cousin.
Sikander's like your brother.
Your cousin.
When did this happen, dad?
He's my older brother...
...Rannchod Singh's son.
'27 years ago,we owned a small arms factory...'
'...in our hometown of Handia,in Allahabad.'
'The arms we made in this factory...'
'...were only suppliedto the Indian Army.'
'Handia's local politician,Gajendra Pathak...'
'...and his son Narender,...
...wanted us to illegallysupply them weapons.'
'I've said this before,...
...I will never do anything illegal.'
- Goodbye.- 'But my brother refused to comply...'
'...and we ended upmaking them our enemies.'
Do you know who you're talking to?
- I'll set this place ablaze.- Shamsher...
Shamsher.
'This incident alsotook a toll on our family.'
'Sumitra,who loved her son Sikander a lot...'
'...was very concerned.'
'A week later our arms consignmentwas being transported by road.'
'We rode with the trucks...'
'...because we had informationthat Gajender was planning...'
'...to hi-jack our trucks.'
'And that's exactly what happened.'
'His men had us surrounded.'
'We ended up killing Gajender'sson in that encounter.'
'Son's death drove Gajender crazy.'
'Gajender swore to ruin our family.'
'And his first target was my brother.'
'But, this feud didn'tend with my brother's demise.'
'Gajender used hispower and influence...'
'...to prove that wesupply arms to terrorists.'
'Our factory was sealed.'
'We were deemed as traitors.'
'And our entire family'slife was in danger.'
'I immediately sent Sikanderto Beijing with Raghu.'
'And I came to Al Shifaalong with Sumitra.'
'My brother had already boughta small island out here...'
'...in order to expand his business.'
With my hard work,I started an arms factory out here.
I took Sumitra under my refuge accordingto our family's rites and rituals.
And married her.
A year later you two were born.
Sumitra's health started todeteriorate after you two were born.
And soon she passed away.
If we hadn't killed Gajendra'sson in a fit of rage...
...then we would stillbe living in our country.
But I promise you...
If you two are with me...
...then soon we'll return to our home.
We'll go back to Handia.
And live togetheronce again like family.
They are gone,it had no effect on them.
They will change.
What the hell is happening, bro?
- What happened?- Nothing...
First mom gave 50% ofher property to Sikander.
And now dad wantsto go back to Handia.
Who wants to go to Handia, man?
Calm down, Suraj.
I was angrier than youafter hearing mom's will.
But I controlled myself.
And whenever dad praisesthat Sikander,...
- ...my blood boils.- I swear.
But, I don't show it.
And, if you want tosolve this problem for good...
...then Sikander must never get awhiff of what's cooking in our minds.
I hope you can do that much, Suraj.
Of course, bro.
- Good.- Of course.
"Come a little closer,and hold my hand..."
"Walk with me,and just sit there."
"And share yourthoughts with me, baby..."
"Just for once be selfish, baby,and live for yourself."
"Just for once be selfish, baby,and live for yourself."
Wow... very nice, bravo.
- Thank you.- Cheers.
Cheers, bro.
- Lovely, lovely.- Cheers, Sikku bro.
- Oh my, God.- What happened?
- We're all such big losers.- Why, bro?
- We have everything we need.- This?
Correct. We have everything we need.
But we don't have what they have.
Yeah man.
...everybody has a girlfriend.
Bro, they are all in love.
Shame on us.
Not all of us.
- Just the three of you.- What?
Meaning I met a girl a few days ago...
- Really?- And I've fallen in love with her.
And soon she'll be coming over,at their party.
It's a done deal.
- Signed, sealed, and delivered.- Really.
With a kiss.
- Yes. Cheers.- Cheers.
Cheers.
Happy for you, bro.
Why are you so sad?
Don't you have abeautiful girlfriend too?
I did.
Again?
Yash, I've got to dosomething about my temper.
I scared her.
It wasn't your temper that scared her.
It was your face.
That's really mean Sikku bro.
Chill, bro. I am there.
That's my sister. That's my sister.
Come here.
I saw that.
It's just not my day today.
You three have raisedthe bar so high...
...that they alllook like idiots to me.
I agree.
The day I find that boy...
...I'll go straight to dad.
And tell him I am in love.
Then get married.
Have couple of children.
And I am done.
Cheers.
- Cheers.- Cheers.
- Cheers, bro.- Cheers.
Come on.
Tell us.
Well, since everyone istalking their heart out...
...so let me sharemy experience as well.
- Hold on. Bro...guitar.- Why?
Background music is important.
- There you go, bro.- Exactly.
- Really?- Of course.
Go on.
So, during my time in Beijing...
...I saw this gorgeous girl.
Beautiful.
Where are you?
I've been waiting for half an hour.
What... You're ditching.
Bye.
Indian!
Be careful...
She's Indian.
We love India.
Best of luck then.
- Hey...what are you drinking?- Sorry...do I know you?
No?
- We'll get to know.- No thanks.
Okay listen,you guys need to leave right now.
No, seriously.
I don't want to make a scene,But I will call security.
- Lovely...- Please leave.
Don't touch me.
- God...- Goodbye.
Hello.
Hello...and thank you.
You are very welcome.
Ahh-Ahh... excuse me...
So now you're goingto officially hit on me.
Men are all the same.
Explain me this to me.
Three guys come over,they praise you...
...but, you don't like that.
An Indian comes to afellow Indian's rescue.
But you don't like that either.
- Isn't that kind of...- Wa...wa...wait!
Weird.
Weird! Yes, weird.
I was born weird.
Oh.. I like that.
So why don't you tell mewhere you were born, what time...
...and what for? What's the purpose?
So that when I have kids,I will avoid all these things totally.
You are so weird.
- Thank you.- That's not a compliment.
Really.
I am weird.
Bye, weirdo.
Oh no.
Are you following me?
Following you...
- I came down this aisle...- Weirdo.
"I'll never...stop following you,sweetheart..."
Listen, this is too much.
I guess I'll haveto call the security.
I...
You know, sweetheart.
This is a very common coincidence.
This two-bedroom suite belongs to me...
...and, that common room belongs to you.
Yeah, right.
I am so stupid!
Yeah...
...very stupid.
Can you hear me?
Actually no...
I am trying to guesswhat you're going to say next.
Sorry.
Fine. These things happen.I understand.
By the way...
...my name is Sikander.
Sikander Singh.
I am Jessica.
Nice to meet you, Jessica.
Nice to meet you, Sikander.

- What happened then?- Then...
I waited for a couple of days.
Then I waited for another week.
And then I found out...
...that she's disappeared.
Awww...
I feel ya, bro.
I felt it too, bro.
I found my true love.
So I'll pray thatyou soon find yours, bro.
What the... it's Birju.
Brij my friend.
Where are you?
How are you?
I am absolutely fine, Shamshu.
- I just landed in your city.- So why call?
Drop by at my mansion.
I came all the way here to meet you.
But this matter is a little sensitive.
I've booked room no.1001 at the Intercontinental hotel.
1001... understand.
Can you meet me in an hour?
It's really urgent.
I can get there before you andwelcome you personally with flowers.
- Just say the word.- Then get there immediately.
Great. See you in one hour.
"Sweety..."
- Shamshu...- Brijwa...
- It's been 10 long years, Brij.- Yes.
But you haven't changed at all.
Enough praising me,and look at yourself.
You still look dashing-fantastic.
If you stand outsideMishra's dairy even now...
...girls willfall head over heels for you.
Don't talk about home,it's depressing.
What's the job?
Shamshu, you know that my boss,Johnny Srivastav...
...owns a 7-star hotel in Manali.
I do... It's really amazing.
But you don't knowwhat goes on in that hotel.
The top politicians and businessmenof India patronize that hotel.
Not because it's exclusive.
But because it's the centerfor every kind of debauchery.
- Brothel.- Yes, a brothel.
And only a handfulof VIPs know about it.
This place offers everykind of sexual perversion.
But these politicians didn't know...
...that Johnny had installedmultiple spy-cams in every room.
And he would record their indulgence.
Only Johnny and I knew this secret.
But somehow thisinformation was leaked...
...and Rana found out about it.
A few days ago Johnnycame to Al Shifa for a deal.
But Rana's men kidnapped him.
Rana's men started torturing Johnny...
...and wanted to knowwhere the hard disk was.
Poor Johnny would'vetold them everything anyway...
...but he died of a sudden heart attack.
- The guy's heart shut down.- Hmmm...
- Due to the torture.- Yes.
And where are the videos?
The videos are on this hard disk.
If we can get ourhandson this hard disk...
...then you can't imaginethe possibilities.
Oh, my...Yash, did you see this?
Dad, this is mind-boggling.It's a gold mine.
But where is this hard disk?
The hard disk is locked away in lockerno. 7003 of the SRL Bank in Cambodia.
All you have to dois steal that hard disk.
Wow... you're a true friend.
You told me about the bankand locker before naming your price.
Great...just great.
I know its great
But the disk is passwordprotected, Shamshu.
And only I know the password.
The password panel is touchSensitive and pressure sensitive too.
So it's very important for me tobe alive while entering the password.
Yeah...
That's even better.
"Sweety..."
Son, Brij wants $1billion in bearer bonds...
...and $1 billion by cheque.
We must speak withthe banker for a loan.
And Interpol Officer Khannawill blackmail the politicians for us.
$2 billion!
1 billion officially,and 1 billion in bearer bonds.
All for a hard disk.
And we're resorting to blackmail.
Through that Interpol officer Khanna.
That sleazy Khanna.
Sleazy deal.
I don't understand the motiveand outcome of this deal.
What did you say?
Waste of time.
Waste of time?
Though you studied at Oxford...
...but, you don't haveeven an ounce of brain.
He wants to knowthe motive and result...
I would've even paidhim $10 billion for it.
I would've sold everything to pay him.
What do we have out here?
What is this?
No one supports me.Not even my own throat.
What are you looking at? Do your job.
Get those two damn boxes here.
Sit...
My intention is to clearyour father's and my name...
...which was discredited years ago.
And the result will bethat we'll be able to return home...
...to Handia, with pride.
That's the motive and the result.
I accepted this jobbecause I have faith in you.
I promise you...
...that I'll risk my lifeto get that hard disk for you.
So that I can send you backto your home in Handia with pride.
I am really homesick, son.
Just send me back home.
So that I may never needRestyl and Calmpose again.
"Sweety..."
- Welcome. Welcome.- Hello.
- Greetings.- Greetings.
Nice party, Raghu.
What's the occasion?
Mr. Khanna has arrived.
- Yeah...yeah...- Excuse me, sir.
Officer Khanna has arrived.
These are our politicians.
They have stooped so low.
They can do anything for debauchery.
And officers like ustake orders from them, sir.
Shameless people.
Some of them, Khanna.
They give a bad nameto all the politicians.
But I must admit, sir.
This hard disk is like a guidedMissile from Al Shifa to India.
And you will launch this missile.
Raghu will give yousoft copies after the party.
And I'll tell youwhat to do with them.
$1 billion... it's a big amount.
- For you, Mr. Goel.- Yes...
Yes...
It must be a pretty big business deal.
Sorry, sir.
We don't tolerate anyoneinterfering in our business.
Our business is our business.
None of your business.
It can take some time.
And Singh sir, you might haveto give some collateral for this loan.
Obviously...
Don't let me catch you again.
Yes... Sorry, sir.
Jessica, you're already here.
I can't believe my eyes.
How can I break your trust?
And you should know me by now.
I never break a promiseor a commitment.
Oh... the man himself. My hero.
He's the guy I work for.
He's like a brother to me.Sikander Singh.
Hi, nice to meet you.

Sikander played it well.
Careful with him.
Guy's out cold.
He can't even handle too much booze.
How will he handle Jessica?
Exactly, Sanju.
How will he handle Jessica?
Listen...you look really happy.
I am... but, nothing's confirmed yet.
Let me confirm,and I'll let you know in the morning.
Ohh...
After you. Come, sis.
Hi.
Hello, weirdo.
Why do you want to meet someone...
...you don't even trustor have faith in?
You're still angry.
He's a great guy.
Yash.
When did you meet him?
When or how, or what'smy relationship with him...
that's none of your business.
You've no right toask these questions.
And, if I'd knownthat you're Yash' boss...
...then I would've never come here.
You were such a jerk.
You're right, I was a jerk.
I made a big mistake.
I am really sorry, Jessica.
I tried to find you after that day.
Yeah, right.
Come on.
I am sorry.
It's over.
Jessica...
I know I went overboard last night.
And I am sorry about it.
That's not the point, Yash.Just leave it alone.
Try to understand, Yash.
Jessica.
Keys, please.
- Stop acting like a child now.- You grow up.
- Yash. Jessica.- Oh god!
Going somewhere?
Not me, she is.
- To stay at the Marriott.- Marriott.
Why? Any special reason?
I am not comfortable here.
- Here?- Yes...
Ohhh...
I wouldn't want to interferebetween boyfriend and girlfriend.
Your thing.
- Congratulations on the girlfriend.- Thank you.
- Bye, Yash.- Enjoy.
- Bye.- Jessica.
Look at them...how they've grown up.
But when will they mature?
Brij must be waiting forthe bonds at the Intercontinental.
You go, Sikander.
Yes...
Great.
Good.
Nonsense. I don't believe this.
And you shouldn't.
Anyone who believes inhear-says are very gullible.
And you're not thatkind of a guy, Yash.
You run around that Sikku all day.
You even took a bullet for him, Yash.
And now he's making a fool out of you.
Bro, this time open your laptop,and not your heart...
...and show him proof.
- Then he will believe you.- Sure.
Wait, wait, wait.
I want to see that hug again.
What passion, bro. What passion.
I can understand the hug.
Even friends hug.
But smooch.
Yash, hi.
Where are you going, Yash?
Yash, come back here.
Yash!
What's wrong, Yash?
What are you doing?
Yash!
What are you doing, ya...
God!
Yash.
- Where is he?- Yash.
- Where is he?- Listen to me.
Where is he?
- Yash, please.- Here I am.
Right here, Yash.
Right here.
Yash.
How could you do this to me, man?
How could you do this to me?
Relax.
Relax?
Sikander.
Every coin has two sides.
On one side is my dear friend...
...and on the other side is the girl.
But remember...
Nothing comes beforefamily and loyalty.
You're 100% right, Yash.
100% right.
But in this situation...
Girl.
But you're so shocked, thatyou're starting to sound very preachy.
Now listen to what I have to say.
Every coin has two sides.
Two...
But this one has four...
She's the same JessicaI met in Beijing.
Six months before she met you.
What do you think?
She just fell in our lap?
A miracle?
You think this is a coincidence.
I said stop it.
- This beautiful...- I said stop it, Sikander.
- Please.- Jessica...
...this is between brothers.
I can't lie to him.
And Jessica, when the foundationof any relationship is based on a lie...
...how's that bloody ever going to work.
And you think I betrayed you.
For what?
For a girl?
For a girl?
Do you want to know the truth?
Forget it.
Bring it on.
Then listen...
That morning when I woke up,I found a note left by Jessica.
It said;
"He babe, I am going tobe out for a couple of days".
"Something urgent has come up."
"I will call you. Love, Jessi."
When I went back for my laptop...
...I noticed that mybag of money was missing.
I found Jessica's airticket from the dustbin.
- Yes?- You will have to come with us.
Thank God you're here.There's been some confusion.
They think I've stolen something.
Is she the one?
Unfortunately.
- I didn't steal anything.- Ma'am, please...
Sikander.
- Please, ma'am.- You know me.
- And when I returned to the hotel.- Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.
I believe this is yours.
Please check the contents.
Our security team apprehendedone of our junior staff's with it.
I am really sorry,sir, for the inconvenience.
- Was there a female involved with him?- No, sir. He was working alone.
- Thank you.- Sorry, sir.
So Jessica didn't steal the bag.
She's very complicated.
After the lady was arrested,I went back to my hotel room.
Feeling like crap.
I thought of doing someinvestigation on my own.
Since you can't even trust love,how can you trust anyone in business?
You know that I always hide a spy camwith all my documents and money.
When I saw the spy cam,imagine what is see.
Jessica, in a green top and red pant...
So Jessica stole the bag.
Yes...
But then I realized something.
Her beautiful hands weren'tthe only ones involved.
- I went down to the Police station...- Let's go.
...and bailed her out.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Listen to me.
I don't want to hear anything.
You suspected me.
How could you?
And I...
And I thought ourrelationship was special.
- I never want to see your face again...- Please be quiet, Jessica.
Stop this charade.
Over-bloody-acting.
I know you stole the bag.
So, weirdo, you met meunder very unusual circumstances.
Very nice.
And I just couldn't helpbut fall in love with you.
Then another situation was created...
...where I doubt you,...
And I am proven wrong.And I feel like crap.
If I hadn't hidden a spy cam...
...then I would stillbe feeling like crap.
Now I just want to know one thing.
You did everything willingly,and why?
I don't know why I was askedto do this, nor did I ask.
When the money is that good,why ask questions?
Who hired Jessica?
Who hired Jessica?
Who hired Jessica?
Suraj and Sanjana.
I must admit theyhave a wicked mind.
I know.
But why are they doing all this?
They want us to butt heads.
Which is why in the securityroom we showed the twins...
...what they wanted to see.
But Yash, you must tell them that...
...all the misunderstandingsbetween us have been cleared now.
And Sikander has promisednever to interfere between us.
You must clear anothermisunderstanding between us.
Whose side are you on?
I am sorry, Yash.
Yours.
It's cool.
But what is their plan?
I don't know.
Those two fools are tryingto eliminate me from this race...
...but they don't know that the'Champion' of this race... is me!
So ladies and gentlemen,as you all know...
...the whole world hasdeclared a war on drugs.
According to ourrecent Interpol reports...
...the drug industry has taken over...
Excuse me...
Hello.
You must be really busy, Khanna.
I called you a couple of times.
But you didn't answer.
Sorry, Shamsher sir,I was busy in a conference.
But please go ahead.
I've texted you thenames of eight politicians.
- You know what to do.- Consider it done, sir.
Great. Great.
Speak to you later.
Raghu, one joker,and eight politicians.
Now watch how thisjoker turns the tables.
Hello.
Mr. Chauhan,this is officer Khanna from Interpol.
Interpol?
It's evident fromthese photos and videos...
...how sensitive is this situation...
These photos and videosshouldn't leak out at any cost.
I am willing to pay any price.
I've been instructedto tell you that...
...you must come toAl Shifa in a few days.
The deal for these photosand videos will go down there.
Okay... Okay, I will be there.
Who do I have to meet?
The place and timewill be texted to you.
Hello... Hello...
Oh my, God.
Napkin.
What's wrong with you, Yash?
Nothing, it's just that Sikander...
I mean I was thinking about Jessica.
Think, Yash, think.
In fact, that's all you cando for the rest of your life now.
You got yourself agirlfriend and her ex-lover.
In a package deal.
It's not funny, Suraj.
Sikander has promised hewon't come between Jessica and me.
And you believed him.
Bro, Yash is so naive.
There are two pointof views to see this situation.
A male and a female.
The male point of view.
Sikander knew thatyou're serious about Jessica.
Still he called Jessicato the security room at 2 am.
Why?
And if Jessica andyou ever get married...
...you'll never be ableto get those two out of your head.
And if that happens,which I think it will...
...what will you do then?
There's nothing you can do, Yash.
Because Sikander's your bro,your mentor, he's everything for you.
Including your wife's lover.
Jealous.
- Now... the female point of view.- Enough!
What do I do, dammit?
- What do I do?- Simple...
Quit 'team Sikander'and join 'team Twins'.
We're willing to offer you10% partnership in our business...
...and Jessica will be 100% yours.
How much is that?
110%
So, Mr. Yash,the ball is in your court.
Bro...
Here's the layout of themunicipal plans for this area.
You book the nightclub...
...and I'll go open an account.
Please come, sir.
Once again thank you so much, sir...
...for opening a bigaccount in our bank.
- You're welcome.- Please come.
This is your locker.
Please take your time.
- Thank you so much, sir.- Thank you.
Sexy uncle, see you later alligator.
See you.
Did you sell your loyalty?
Forget 10%, I wouldn't join handswith them even for 100%
But if someone tries to buyme with love, then that's different.
They don't make men like you anymore.
What is their modus operandi?
They have a wicked mind.
Didn't tell me anything.
It's in our genes.
Runs in our blood.
And every inch of our body.
In the entire family.
Sir, Sikku and everyone else mustbe waiting in the premiere room...
...we called them at 12 sharp.
Coming, Raghu, coming.
And the blind school peopleare here for the donation.
Just fill in the name.
Yes, Khanna, what's the update?
Shamsher sir...
You let a cat loose amongst pigeons.
All the politiciansare ready for a meeting.
Great.
So we meet exactly after 8 days.
Yes, sir.
So...
The street layout of theSRL bank is on this digital screen.
Okay.
Uncle, I've only one condition.
This heist will be onlycarried out by family.
Better, much better.
Correct, dad.
Family members will do it together.
Yeah, bro.
We'll steal the harddisk on Saturday night.
This is SRL Bank,and here's the basement.
Sorry, dad. I am hungry.
The locker room's inthe basement of the SRL bank.
The hard disk is in locker no. 7003.
There's a nightclubadjacent to the bank.
There's a drainage thatconnects the nightclub...
...and this bank's wall.
Sorry!
Suraj, Sanjana, Yash.
You three will arrive in Cambodiaon Saturday night by flight.
Here you'll find a yellow vanin the airport's parking lot.
Yellow van, guys.
How tacky.
Twins, just hear him out, guys.
We are listening.
And Yash, we are born winners.
Even if you two run alone in a race,you'll still come second.
Understand?
And I'll arrive inCambodia by helicopter.
Give me your hand please.
Don't worry,I am not proposing to you.
That hurts.
Good.
Please...
Doesn't matter, your loss.
- This is a micro-fluid tracking device.- Show me.
Through this, we can track each other.
Micro-fluid tracking device.
Nonsense.
Think twice beforeyou ask for my hand again.
I guess Cambodia's getting to you.
Your humor's getting better
- Weirdo.- Let's go.
Come on, guys.
Let's go.
Yash. Come in, Yash.
Yes, Sikku.
Come on, guys.
It's show time.

No... Help me, please...
Move.
Come fast.
Move.
Dad.
Suraj.
Your hard disk.
God job.
I knew I could trust Sikander.
Great. Great.
Let's have a party tomorrow.
Sure, dad.I'll get it organized.
Where are the others?
Sikku's taking the long way home.
He'll arrive tomorrow evening.
And as for Yash and Sanjana.
They will be herein a couple of hours.
Whose calling? Jessica?
Dad's calling.
Dad?
Yes... your dad.
He's trying to make a video call.
Should I answer it?
Dad and all, huh.
Why don't you tell him about us first?
I know.
I feel bad about it.
Once we're out of this stress...
...then I'll talk to Suraj and dad.
I love you, Yash.
What are you thinking?
You know what...
The way you pulledoff this entire plan...
I am shocked.
Why?
A; You planted Jessicain Sikander's life.
B; On your instructions, she toldSikander that Suraj and I planted her.
And the best part...
C; That smart-alec gotso engrossed in all this,...
...that he never suspected about you.
Genius, huh!
Rana? Why is he calling you?
Chill, Sanjana.
In our business,the fewer the enemies we have...
...the more our business grows.
Cambodia is Rana's fortress.
I can have Sikanderkilled right there.
But your mother's Will saved him.
Mother's will?
There's a clause which states that...
...if any one of you diesan unnatural death,...
...then his share will go to charity.
- Oh no.- And I can't let that happen.
But there's only onething that's bothering me.
Jessica. She knows everything.
Jessica. Jessica.
How much do you make ina year by conning people?
$300,000.
I'll give you one million.
What's the job?
Two things.
One, you must do exactly as I say.
Second, no questions.
That's it?
Deal.
Job over, game over.
Do I even know you, Yash?
I always thought of youas a very loyal and honest man.
I am...
...but only for us.
Nowadays, if you wantto live on your own terms...
...you got to be a little selfish.
"Come closer and hold my hands."
"Walk with me and sit with me."
"And share your thoughts with me."
"Just once, baby,be selfish and live for yourself."
"Just once, baby,be selfish and live for yourself."
"Just once, baby,be selfish and live for yourself."
"Don't ever...think..."
"...that I am misleading you."
"I know...that I am..."
"...no one to you."
"But you've done...done so much for me."
"And I have a rightto be selfish for... you."
"Just once baby,be selfish and live for yourself."
"There's a smile...on your face."
"But why are your eyes...moist?"
"I am very happy..."
"...and yet...there's something lacking."
"Let's fill this void forever."
"Let's rely on each other."
"Just once baby,be selfish and live for yourself."
"Just once baby,be selfish and live for yourself."
- Hello.- Captain.
I smell some good news.
No worries,he will be here for 50 years.
And if you want,I can kill him right now.
No, no. Let him stay alive.
- Soon you'll get the rest of your money.- Okay.
God protects you...
...and keeps you from all harm.
Explaining.
Now this.
What happened?
God protects you andkeeps you from all harm.
What?
Explaining.
Catch him.
Take your positions. Catch them.
Catch him.
There. There.
Shoot him.

Take him out. Shoot him.
- Catch him.- Catch him.
- Close the gate. Close the gate.- Stop him.

Everybody fire, go now.
Perfect timing.
If it wasn't for me...
Then it would've been someone else.
- Idiot.- Oh no.
Sorry.
What?
Sorry.
It's okay.
So many obstacles and hurdles.When is this going to end, man?
These hurdles and area part of the race of life.
They start before we're born.
But don't end after we die.
Too deep. Bouncer.
In short...
I won't spare those rascals...
...Whoever is bloodyresponsible for this.
Oh no.
Do I have to dress you up as well?
Suit up. Wear your gear.
Need some help.
- Thanks.- Watch out.
Okay, all set.
Cheers.
"We're coming back to the race."

What am I hearing, Suraj?
I don't know, dad. I swear.
This is ridiculous.
We're not responsible for whateverhappened with brother in Cambodia.
And what's her name...
Yeah, Jessica.
What's this Jessica angle?
There is no angle, dad.
I can't figure out who putsthis filth in Sikander's mind?
Okay, Suraj.
You try to hide it your way...
...and I'll find out my way.
And if turns out to be true...
...then you'll have to answer for it.
And then I'll deal with it.
Deal with what, dad?
Do you even see us?
I mean you can't see beyondyour blue-eyed boy Sikander.
Sikku.
Who will run the business?
Sikku.
Who will look afterthe administration?
Sikku.
Who's the smartest andmost intelligent amongst us?
Sikku.
I am sick of this Sikku, dad.
But enough is enough.
What's on your mind?
What do you want?
- Split.- Split?
We'll handle the business...
...he can take his share and leave.
We've no problem. But...
...for good.
You two will handle the business.You two?
Exactly, dad.
You always underestimate us.
What?
Underestimate?
I didn't expect this from you two.
Expectations.
Dad, you shouldn't betalking about expectations.
I know what's good and what's bad.
And as long as I am alive,there will be no split.
Don't be so difficult, dad.
Like you always said...
Love grows when you share.
I do...
Love grows when you share,but not split.
But dear...
You could neither learnour language nor the emotion.
I trust Sikander completely.
And until this deal isn't sealed,you two won't mess things up.
Is that clear?
Is that clear?
- Sure, dad.- Yes, dad.
Mr. Goel called from the bank.
He's sanctioned theloan against our property.
You three will signthe bank documents.
Goodnight.
Sad. Very sad.
Unfortunately...
There's no cure for stupidity.
What's the matter, uncle?
You're still awake.
Thinking about home?
Shall I get Calmposeor Restyl for you?
You're my Restyl and Calmpose.
Come, nephew.Walk with me.
I never imagined thosetwo hated you so much.
What should I do withthis bloody power and money?
Should I shove it up my...locker.
Now I am completely determined.
I just want to seal thisdeal and go back to Handiya.
This deal isn't going anywhere, uncle.
But can I give you an advice.
You handled thismatter completely wrong.
If you give so much love and alwaysbe partial to me in front of them...
...then obviously,those two are bound to hate me.
You're absolutely right, Sikku.
I wish I had realized this earlier...
...then my familywould've never split up.
This family will never split up.
This is my challenge.
Our family will neversplit up or scatter.
Relax uncle...I am always there for you.
Hey, Jessica.What are you doing here?
The job's done.
When are you planning to end my game?
Isn't that what Yash said,...
...on the yacht?
Bugs.
And, not the ones that bite.
Micro transmitters. For listening.
- Listen...- No, you listen, sweetheart.
You and Yash hired me becauseyou two thought I am a con woman.
That was my cover.
But I am a government agent.
I have a full briefon your entire family.
I came here to investigatethe illegal distribution of arms.
But it was a completelydifferent ballgame out here.
Hard Disks.
Politicians blackmailed.
Big money.
Relax.
Your family's secretsare safe with me.
Cheers.
Ouch!
Yash, leave.
Yash.
Stop it!
How much do you want?
Have you lost it, Yash?
You're not paying this damn woman.
Sanjana, please.
Don't behave like your brother.
Let's just get over with this.
Speak.
I want $50 million.
In bearer bonds.
Tomorrow at 12...
...leave the bag underthe Marina Lamppost.
And don't be late.
Or else it's game over for all of you.
- Sam.- Yes, sir.
As soon as Jessica orone of her men grab the bag...
...follow them.
Sir, here are the mortgage paper.
Please sign them.
I'll just inform the head office.
The funds will be transferredto your account in half an hour.
Thank you.
This sucks man.
- Yes, Khanna.- Shamsher sir,...
...the politicians have arrived.
Okay.
We'll be there in half an hour.
Shamshu, complete!
Complete!
You know, son.
There's a saying in Handiya.
"Nothing happens before time."
I am truly overwhelmedtoday by your gesture.
This story which began years ago...
...is finally comingto an end because of you.
What to do, Bhaiji?
Every time I look in your eyes...
...I can't help but miss my father.
I did all this for my family.
And, if I've to kill for my family...
...I won't hesitate.
Come on.
Sikander deserves all the praise.
He's pure gold.
Pure gold.
I wish he was my son.
History has a bad habit, Raghu.
It always repeats itself.
Poor son died thesame way his father did.
Brother must be really happyto finally meet his son today.
God bless their souls.
Let's go, Raghu.
The politicians must be waiting.
"Sweety..."
All good, dad.
I've got a bad feeling about this.
Please stand up.
Some time back, my nephew Sikander...
...whom I loved like my son...
...unfortunately died in a car accident.
One minute of silence, please.
Thank you, gentlemen.
But the show must go on.
Please be seated.
I'll come straight to the point.
In exchange for the videos...
...I want 25,000 sq.ft of sez area in each of your state...
...where I can shipmy arms as well as drugs.
- What is he talking about?- Cocaine.
Meow Meow. MDMA.
Mandrakes.Etcetera. Etcetera. Etcetera.
Come, kiddo. Come.
Meet, Rana. My new business partner.
Come.
Only fools butt headsin a profitable business.
Isn't it, Raghu?
Give them the details of the deal.
Everyone knows thatdrugs are very harmful.
But their demand keepsrising at 300% every year.
Just imagine the amountof money we can make.
And you'll get $50 millionevery year for this job.
Yash.
Now you take over.
Show them this hard disk.
It will make it easierfor them to make a decision.
Come, come.
Rana, let's celebrate ourbusiness partnership together.
Sikander.
Mom.
My son.
By the time you get this tape,...
...you would've turned 25.
I have faith in my blood.
You'll fulfill thetask that I will give you.
Your father wasn't killedby any politician of Handiya...
...in fact he was murdered byour distant relative Shamsher Singh.
The same Shamsher Singh...
...whom your fathertreated as his brother.
I was pregnant whenyour father passed away.
Pregnant with Suraj and Sanjana.
I trusted ShamsherSingh and came to Al Shifa.
After Suraj and Sanjana were born,I found out that...
...Shamsher Singh was the mastermindbehind the entire conspiracy.
Now he's slow poisoning me.
But before I die,I've made an impenetrable Will...
...so that Shamsher Singhcannot harm my children.
You're the eldest of your siblings,Sikander.
I entrust you with the responsibilityof saving our family.
My blessings are with you.
How did this videoget on this hard disk?
How?
Yash!
Sit down.
Sit down!
Now that you know thatyou're not my children.
I'll tell you I did this for my child.
My kid.
My real son...
Is Yash.
- Lets go- I am going to kill you guys.
Both of you.
I am going to kill you.
By signing the mortgage papersyou've already failed your mom's Will.
For me, you'll are finished.
We're so unfortunate.
We treated our brother like an enemy.
And our real enemy as our father.
Missing your brother, are you?
Why don't I send you two to him?
Suraj!
I am really missing Sikku today.
I wish brother was here...
You wished...
God protects you andkeeps you from all harm.
Missed you, bro.
- We missed you.- Missed you too.
I can't leave you twoalone for even a moment.
Why do you look so surprised?
Did you see a ghost, bhaiji?
Give me some time.
All my life I called you Bhaiji.
It will take sometime to call you rascal.
Rascal.
I've known the truthfor the past 10 years.
And in these 10 years...
And every day,every moment, I died many deaths.
Every time you caressed my cheeks...
...it would remind me howmy mother suffered to death.
Every time you sang...
...it would remind mehow you killed my father.
And whenever you hugged me...
...it would remind me...
...how you kept us,brothers and sister, apart.
And you...
...let your father's love corrupt you.
Sikander...
...there are two ways.
First...
When your kin makes a mistake,...
...you leave him.
Second...
Even if your kin makes a mistake,...
...don't ever leave him.
And you decided not to leave him.
Your job is to takerevenge for your family.
And my job is to protect my father.
Wait...wait...wait...
Son...stop this stupid melodrama.
Sikander knows...
I never do anything without insurance.
What have you done, Raghu?
It contains 50 grams of gelatin...
...and I've alreadypressed the detonator.
I know.
Sexy uncle.
I've been looking for an opportunityto repay your father's debts.
And today I got one.
And for the first time, youaddressed this man by his right name.
Rascal.
Sikander.
He was offering you paradise.
- But you kept chasing after hell.- Raghu!
- Let's go together.- Raghu!
Is this what you call insurance?
This wealth, the weapons, drugs!
I see... And for you?
Family. Humanity. Love.
Go.
Cover from all sides.
Cover from all sides.
Team 2; Z-formation.
Block him. Block him.
All eyes on Sikander.
So what were you saying?
I should avenge my family.
And you'll protect your father.
So protect your father.
This is the time, bro.
Why did you save me?
What you did to us was wrong.
In fact very wrong.
But you did it towin your father's love.
But I know...
...you must be feeling worse than me.
And what's the pointin punishing someone...
...who has alreadyrealized his mistake?
Never again.
Come on.
Remember what I said.
Our family will neverBreak up or split.
There's another thing I said to you.
I will send you back to your home.
With respect, to Handiya.
Take him.
Son, this isn't over yet.
I know.
But your chapter's over.
Take him outta here, baby.
There's still time.
I know you all have alot of doubts in your mind.
And questions too.
Bring it on.
How did you do this?
I mean how did you know that...
...that Yash has planted Jessica.
Because Suraj and Sanjanawere never so close to me to know...
...that I always hide aspy cam along with the money.
Bad habit,but now I'll take another name.
Shoot.
And that name is Yash.
But that hard disk was always with me.
Fake hard disk.
And what about the money thatJessica blackmailed us for.
Cheers.
Jessica's money is nowback along with Jessica.
I have an offer for you.
This is Johnny's hard disk.
- And you must unlock it.- And my money?
Here is $50 million in bearer bonds.
And mom's video?
Here.
What is this?
Your mother asked meto give you this today.
Take a look.
Sexy uncle.
What a man.
So this was your plan all along.
It was always my planto keep my family close.
What can I say, officer?
I've done some thingswhich I am not proud of.
I killed my brother,killed my sister-in-law.
Syphoned from my own children.
Pushed my son down the wrong path.
How can a father do somethinglike this to own his son?
And all that for what?
Money?
Power?
But where is that money?
That power?
All that gets left behind, officer.All of it.
Anyway...
I've heard that your wifeShakuntala hasn't been keeping well.
She has a problem with her kidney.
And she's on dialysis.
And your daughter, Kusum, isn't it?
She wants to be a doctor.
The medical seat would easily costyou at least 10 or 20 million rupees.
And I also heard you'reretiring in 6 months.
Think about your family.
This race isn't over yet.
Because Shamsher is still...
...alive.
So there's going to be another 'race'.
Of course.
- But...- But...
Who will be the Sikander of that race?
The Sikander of that race...
How would I know?
- Cheers.- Cheers.
Cheers, Sikander.
