No, sit down. Sit down.
Laura!
-Say, uh, that's the back door, ain't it?
-Yeah.
I-I was about to put up a bottle
on the house.
- Yeah, that'll be the day.
Get the pipe. Get the pipe.
-Was he wearing a gun?
-Sure didn't stay very long.
He ain't goin' nowhere.
Just gettin' somethin' out of his pack.
Say, do you know what kind of gun that was?
That was a Swedish kind of gun.
Uh, Swedish.
Get a rag.
So cheap, he squeezes out the bar rag.
Wet enough for you, mister?
Starts raining up here,
it doesn't know when to stop.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
-I got a 20 and –
-You got a 20?
What are you doing, Coyle?
I brought that chair over here.
You're lucky you got a gimp leg,

-It comin' back to you, Frank?
-Yeah, we got it.
What you give me?
-Gentlemen.
-Where'd you get all that money?
Wanna take a look at these?
I'll put in 10.
Say, Professor.
Didn't you say somethin'
about a bottle on the house or somethin'?
Sheehan wouldn't say that.
That's what he said.
Yeah, that's what he said.
- Yeah, I'm, uh –
- Shh!
I'm Patrick Sheehan. This is my place.
Shouldn't we make a deal?
Uh, well, um, how much a bottle?
- Three dollars.
Three dollars?
Yesterday it was two dollars.
Well, look, uh, how about
we go 50-50 on that?
-I share your profits?
-You want to share the losses?
I supply the place.
Yeah, but, uh,
I think I supply the customers.
Nobody's bought nothing yet.
Tell you what, you give these boys
a two-dollar bottle on me,
and then I'll stand my own losses
and you can make your profit on the whiskey.
That's good.
-One three-dollar bottle, Pat.
-Bring it on.
Forty, fifty.
Two-sixty. Two-sixty.
Well, there's 52 there.
-Throwin' away good liquor on him.
-Might as well wave good-bye to your flask.
Well, you boys don't know nothin' about me
and I don't know nothin' about you.
So what do you say we make this
a nickel game, huh? To start off with.
Nickel? Let's make it a dime.
I thank you very kindly, sir.
Now, what I'd like to do,
I'd like to make this a five-card stud
with a, uh, three-bet roof on the card.
And then maybe we get to see, uh, 15 cents
on an open pair and the last card.
Unless you have
no objections about that, I'd –
-That's good. I'm in for five.
-Fifteen and the open pair? I'm in.
Comin' to kick your ass, boy.

I'm a whore and I know

And I know that if you had a house up here,
you'd stand to make yourself a lot of money.
Now, this is all you gotta do –
put up the money for the house.
I'll do all the rest – I'll look after the girls,
the business, the expenses,
the running, the furnishing, everything.
And I'll pay you back any money
you put in the house
so's you won't lose nothin'.
And we'll make it 50-50.
Excuse me. You know I already got
a whorehouse operating up here.
Can't call them crib cows whores.
I'm talking about a proper sporting house
with class girls and clean linen
and proper hygiene.
Well, I don't think you're gonna
find my clientele up here,
uh, too interested in that sort of thing.
They will be, once they get a taste of it.
I'm telling you, with someone up here
to handle all them punters properly,
you could make yourself at least double
the money you'll make on your own.
What makes you think I ain't thought of that?
Them tents, you know, they's just temporary.
What do you do
when one girl fancies another?
How do you know
when a girl really has her monthly
or when she's just taking a few days off?
What about when they don't get their monthlies?
'Cause they don't. What do you do then?
I suppose you know all about seeing to that.
And what about the customers?
Who's gonna skin them back
and inspect them? You?
What you –
If you don't, this town will be clapped up
inside of two weeks, if it's not already.
What about when business is slow?
You just gonna let the girls
sit around on their bums?
'Cause I'll tell you, when a good whore
gets time to sit around and think,
four out of five times she'll turn to religion
'cause that's what they was born with.

Why you guys
so against taking a bath?

'sides go home and play

- Oh, shut up, Maisie!
You ever know a Chink
wanna fuck another Chink
when there's a white woman around?
-Come on!
-Stop whining or I'll scratch your eyes out.
Get in there.
Cor blimey! How they do go on.
You said in your letter there was
a house here. You call this a house?
I had to get something out of it.
You stole that from Christine!
That's a goddamn rotten lie.
I paid $13 for it.
Aw, shut up, Eunice.
You're always bloody well complaining.
-Dollar to you, Jack.
-Call.
- Riley?
Say, do you know what I heard?
I heard one of them girls they were bringing up
was an authentic Chinese princess.
Do you think that's true
what they say about Chinese girls?
Horseshit. If that was true,
their legs would fall off.
Oh, come on!
It's true.
You see, if you notice their eyes,
the way they slant, you know,
- and the way they tip up at the side,
well, that's –
that's true for their whole –
that's true – that's true
for the rest of their bodies.
A friend of mine, Amos Lindville,
down in Sacramento, California,
he once spent five dollars to find out.
Five dollars he spent just to have a look.
And he said it's true. It's true.
A guy like Amos Lindville
isn't gonna spend five dollars
just to find out something
that isn't true.

Fourteen and eight. Fourteen and eight.
--Get out of here!
Why are you always in such a lousy temper?
Because, my dear Mrs. Miller,
I not only built you
your gooseberry ranch,
I've paid for a bathhouse I don't need,
I've paid for transportation,
I've paid for towels and linens,
an enema bag.
I've paid for things them chippies of yours
don't even know how to use.
But I have not sold a full bottle of whiskey
in here today, and that's a fact.
And that, my dear Mr. McCabe,
is 'cause every geezer in this town
was taking a bath in your bathhouse
or having it off with a girl in your whorehouse.
Well, I ain't seen none of that money, and what
my books tell me I need most right now is money.
Whorehouse, bathhouse money
for the first week.
We're short on the bath money
'cause of the first night's rush,
but I'll see it doesn't happen again.
Well, I'm not surprised you don't know how much
money you've got and how much you ain't.
You've got your credit column
on a different page from your debits.
Hey, I'll thank you to keep your little nose
out of things you don't understand.
-What's 14 from 23?
-What?
You heard me. Fourteen from 23.
Nine.
Nine plus 16?
-Twenty-five. Five and –
-My dear madam!
I can hold my own in any game of chance
with any amount you can count
and figure out payoffs
before you can blink an eye.
Don't give me them horse puckies just 'cause
it takes me time to write it up formal.
Well, if you're so bloody smart,
then you'd know
that if we bought the windows
and doors for the whorehouse,
you'd make twice as much money!
Or perhaps you like the idea of screwing
with the wind whistling up your Khyber!
How come whenever you talk about
spending money, you say "we"?
I say "we," Mr. McCabe,
because you think small!
You think small
'cause you're afraid to think big.
I'm telling you, you have to spend money
to make money.
You want to spend the rest of your life
shuffling cards in this dump? Fine. I don't!
There's gonna come a time –
There's gonna come a time when I sell you
me half interest, go to San Francisco
and buy me a legitimate boardinghouse.
But right now I don't want no small-timer
screwing up me business!
Boardinghouse, huh?
Like to get a good look at them boarders.
Hey!
Where do you think you're off to?
Money and pain.
Pain, pain, pain.
Hey, Al, look at this!
-Hey, hon, you work at Mrs. Miller's?
-That's my wife, you son of a bitch!
- Come on! I'd pay her!
- Goddamn you!
Bart!
You son of a – You young –
Grab him. Grab him.
For Christ's sake. Hold him, will ya?
-Come on! Hold him!
-Shit, Bart.
-Come on. Hold it.
-Easy, easy, easy.
-Bart?
-Jesus Christ.
There's blood,
and his head's all busted open.
Come on, let's pick him up.
-Come on. Pick him up. Come on. Get him up!
-Get the other leg.
Take it slow.
I don't have much time.
Hey, who's with the bottle of gin?
-Well, it's – That's in my room.
-Kate!
-Kate!
-I'll get it.
Alma, you go and get it. Where is it?
Under me pillow.
It's under her pillow.
Booze stays down here, Blanche.
Girls, she's gonna be in in a minute.
-How are we doing? Nearly finished?
-Well, I took some of the pink off.
Well, you think you could
write "Birdie" there?
-Think you can do that?
-Mmm.
All right.
You like this?
You like this? Pink and white.
Yeah, very pretty. Tasty, yeah.
Thank you very much.
I'll get back to you later.
Mr. McCabe?
Mr. McCabe?
Excuse me.
My name is Sears. Eugene Sears.
Oh. And I'm Roebuck.
Who's watching the store?
I'm, uh – I'm with M.H. Harris
and Shaughnessey Mining Company.
We'd like to have a talk, if we could.
No shit.
Truth of the matter is, Mr. McCabe,
we're interested
in the mining deposits up here.
Well, the truth of the matter is
that I would like to have a little drink.
-Would you care to join me?
-We'd like to buy you a drink, Mr. McCabe.
Wait a minute. You got a turd in your pocket
or something? Who the hell is "we"?
This is Ernie Hollander. He's with me.
-Ah. You want a drink, Ernie?
-Sure, I'd like a drink.
-But my stomach can't handle it anymore.
-Hmm.
Look, Mr. McCabe,
I don't want you to misunderstand.
Oh, no, there's nothing to misunderstand.
You want to buy out the zinc, go ahead.
I don't own any goddamn zinc mines.
Hey, Robbie,
get us a bottle up here, will ya.
Hey, you boys know about the –
you boys know about the frog
who got ate by the eagle?
Here's this, uh, big old eagle.
He swooped down
and gobbled up this little frog, see?
And the little frog is inside the eagle
and they're way up in the air,
and the frog is working his way back
in the eagle, working his way back.
And he looked out of the eagle's ass
and he says, "Hey, eagle!"
He says, "Oh!"
He says, uh, "How high up are we?"
And the eagle says, "Well," he says,
"we're up about a mile, two miles."
And the frog says, he says,
"Well, uh, you wouldn't shit me now,
would ya?"
That's good.
That's really good, Mr. McCabe.
- I'll have to remember that.
Now, Mr. McCabe, uh,
we know you're a businessman,
and we're businessmen, so, uh,
what we'd like to do is
make you an offer –
buy out all your holdings
here in Presbyterian Church.
All right. How much?
-I'd like to point out a few things first.
-Why don't you just tell me how much.
Then you can point out all the goddamn things
you – What the hell kind of coat is that?
-That's seal skin.
-Oh.
Uh, the company won't go
over $5,500. I know that.
Well, that, uh, ain't high enough, is it?
Now listen, we just bought out
Sheehan down there for 1,600.
Hotel, his livery stable, the whole works.
Well, now, you certainly got
fucked there, didn't you?
Listen, uh, Mr. McCabe,
if we can't talk this over reasonably –
We were empowered to work with you
because we were led to believe
that you were the town's leading citizen,
a man of good common sense,
if you know what I mean.
Roebuck, uh, you know,
if a frog had wings
he wouldn't bump his ass so much.
-You follow me?
-What?
Well, I got better offers than that
from Monkey Ward.
So if you boys wanna talk business with me,
what you gotta do is, you gotta get your offer
way up there in the air where it belongs.
Uh, Smalley, fill up that,
uh, no-limit game for me, will ya.
Well, now, what do you think of that?
He's a real smart-ass, he is.
Let's go.
Happy birthday, Birdie!
Oh, look at the beautiful cake!
Oh, it's –
Did you make that, Lily? It's beautiful.
Oh. I could never blow 'em out.
Oh! Well, Mr. McCabe isn't –
Don't worry about McCabe.
I don't think he'll be over tonight.
- Uh, well, he was tying one on.
-Oh.
-Come on.
- No, you got to make a wish.
- Um –
What'd you wish?
I –
Don't!
I can't do that.
-Take them all out.
-I want the one with the flower.
Bend my head down.
No, thank you. I'd just like a piece of cake.
It's just so exciting!
I want the one with the flower!
Oh, Connie, aren't you gonna
stay and have a piece of my cake?
What's wrong with her?
She's gotten into one of them quiet times.
-Who's that?
-Uh, uh, it's... me.
-What do you want?
-Well, uh –
O-Open the door. Come on.
Listen, don't think you can fool me
with that Bay Rum again,
'cause it won't work.
You had a bath?
Madam, I've been in the goddamn water
so long, my ass is wrinkled up.
Now, open the door.
You make me sick sometimes.
Couldn't you even turn up
for that poor little girl's birthday party?
I'll tell you something, little lady.
A couple gimpers come in the saloon tonight
and offered to buy me out.
My whole spread.
Who'd do a dull thing like that?
Well, uh, uh –
It's, uh, "Harrison," Shaughnessey,
something like that.
Offered me $5,500.
Take your hat off the bed. It's bad luck.
$5,500. 'Tain't bad, eh, Mrs. Miller?
I played it smart as a possum. I give 'em a "no"
and went right on about my business.
Just turned them down flat as a pancake.
See, what's gonna happen is,
they're gonna come back with a better offer.
And, uh, I think your share
is gonna be, uh –
-Well, let me see.
-"Think."
What did you say?
I should have known.
Huh?
You turned down Harris and Shaughnessey.
You know who they are?
Of course I know who they are.
Well, you just better hope they come back.
They'd as soon put a bullet in your back
as look at you.
Shh! It's Kate and Mr. Anderson.
-Is Mr. McCabe in there with her?
-How would I know?
Get out. A dollar doesn't give you
the right to get dressed in here.
I don't have a whole lot of time.
- You just got no respect.
- Two gentlemen downstairs
to see Mr. McCabe.
--Is he in there with you?
Yes.
Now, our Mr. McCabe'll be with you in just
a wee minute, so you wait right there now.
McCABE:
You're, uh, spending your profits, huh?
Fantastic.
- Ah, gentlemen.
- Oh, Mr. McCabe.
-You gentlemen smoke cigars?
-Uh, no. No, thank you.
-Uh, Mr. McCabe, Mr. Hollander and I –
-Here, here, here.
-Put one in there.
-Thank you.
We appreciate you wanting to take
a strong position on this thing.
In fact, we admire it.
-Ernie, uh, do you want to –
-No, no, you go right ahead, Eugene.
Well, what we'd like to do is,
we'd like to make a new approach.
Oh? Okay.
Well, you remember,
uh, our offer this evening?
Uh... an offer...
No.
-Well, it was $5,500.
-Now, that's why I don't remember it.
$5,500.
Well, Ernie, I think we can get the company
to come up with another $750.
That would make it 6,250, yeah.
Of course, we'd have to have
an immediate answer on that.
Well, Mr. Sears, uh,
the immediate answer to that would be no.
--Aaah! No, no.
I have to tell you the rest of my story.
Come on.
Excuse me. If I may intercede here.
Mr. McCabe. May I call you John?
-Of course.
-I have a son called John, not unlike you.
You've done a wonderful job here.
You've built up a beautiful
little business in no time at all.
And here we are, ready to give you
a substantial gain in capital,
an offer from one of the most solid
companies in the United States.
And you say no.
Well, uh, frankly, I don't understand.
Uh, I guess I don't have to tell you
that some of our people
are going to be quite concerned.
You know what I mean?
Well, the way I feel about this is
that you gentlemen come up here
and you – you want a man in my position
to sell off his property.
And I think there's got to be
a good reason.
Now, I would think
that a pretty good reason
would be $14,000, $15,000.
But why don't you gentlemen come on over
to my place tomorrow morning for breakfast,
and we'll just talk about it.
Say about 8:00?
Blanche, Birdie. Come on over here
for a minute, will you?
Now, this here is Mr. Sears
-and Mr. –
-Hollander.
-Mr. Sears, how are you?
-Hollander.
Now, you just take good care
of these gentlemen.
You look lovely tonight.
Would you like to have a drink,
or would you like to go upstairs?
Everything's on me.
-Is that your pleasure, upstairs?
-We haven't had dinner yet.
You don't need it.
Come on, Constance, open up.
Constance?
Come on, Constance.
Goddamn, I never knew nobody in my life
spent so much time behind locked doors.
-No –
-Oh, what a nice velour.
-Look at that.
-No, I'm sorry.
Does it go on this way?
Ah, isn't that nice?
-Ah, come on. Did you want to play?
-No, no.
-Sure, you do. Look at this.
-They have to go now.
What do you mean?
You're no fun at all.
No, we haven't had dinner.
We're going to go eat.
Well, see, when you get yourself
in a gambling situation,
you've got to know
when the other fellow's bluffin'.
Didn't I tell you them two gimpers
would come back to me, huh?
I told you. You see, once in a while,
if you could just learn to trust me, Constance,
everything gonna be a lot easier.
You'll find that out.
How high do you think they'll go?
I don't know.
Tomorrow morning at breakfast
is gonna tell the tale.

-Well, 6,250.
-I don't think so.
He hasn't the brains.

-What you want?
-Wait a minute, mister. I don't mean no –
-Then what you come up here for?
-I heard you had the fanciest whorehouse
in the whole territory up here.
Gee, it's been so long
since I had a piece of ass.
Well, you come on up here,
I'll show you what you're looking for.
What's cooking? I sure am hungry.
-What the hell is that?
-It's a carpet vacuum machine.
Oh, yeah?
Well, who wants to be next?

Ah, hell. Don't make no difference.
I'm gonna have you all.
Eh –
Goddamn.
Blanche, some mail come in today.
This here's for Mrs. Miller.
Oh. Oh, that must be
the new petticoat she ordered.
Oh, hi. Boy, they sure
weren't kidding about this place.
-What's that? Is that a letter for me?
-Uh –
That's for me.
I'll just take this on up to Mrs. Miller.
Mr. McCabe. She's got company.
Well, I'll just leave it here then.
Well, it just hurts so much.
I guess maybe I'm small?
No. You've just got to learn
to relax, that's all.
I think maybe this will do.
Stand up. Take your top off.
You've got to take your mind off it.
Think of something else, you know?
Look at a wall.
Count the roses in the wallpaper.
What are you doing?
There's nothing to hide.
See, the thing is, it don't mean nothing.
You never know.
You might even get to like it.
I mean, you managed it with Bart,
didn't you, eh?
Oh, yeah. You really are small,
aren't you? Just like me.
I'll get a few pins.
Oh, but with him, I had to.
It was my duty.
Turn around.
It weren't your duty, Ida.
You did it to pay for your bed and board.
And you do this
to pay for your bed and board too.
Only you get to keep a little extra for yourself
and you don't have to ask nobody for nothing.
Just more honest, to my mind.
Don't worry.
You're gonna do just fine here.
A dollar?
- Then I'm out.
-Okay, I'll bump you a dollar.
-Make it five.
-Quit looking at my damn cards.
-You don't got it.
Okay, I'll call you.
Got the aces.
Shit, you little fart.
You've been looking at my damn cards.
No, you don't know how to bet.
Anybody can tell what you got.
Come on. Get in.
Deal this hand for me.
McCabe, Webster's going down
the mountain today in his wagon.
What's that got to do with me?
Blanche says there's still time
to get on that boom around Portland.
She says that you can open a business
there for no money at all.
Somebody's gotta go there first, have a look.
I think you should go today with Webster.
I'm your partner.
You gotta listen to me.
What are you planning to do
about them blokes up there?
You talking about them boys up there?
Smalley's up there talking to 'em now.
He's gonna bring 'em down.
I'm gonna make a deal with them.
-What if they don't make a deal?
-Then I won't make a deal with them.
I'll just have a drink.
Would you care to join me in a drink?
You shouldn't worry what people think.
They won't even know.
Webster's covered his wagon now.
He found all this canvas,
and he's just covered his wagon.
He's covered his wagon.
No one would even –
Anyway, what the hell do you
have to answer to anyone for?
I mean, you bloody well own
this town, don't you?
I appreciate you warning me.
I appreciate that.
But there ain't nothing to be scared of.
I tell you the truth.
They're the ones that got
to make a deal, not me!
I feel sorry for 'em.
Them old gimpers been working that company
20 years. They don't know what to do.
The company says, "Get on up there
and make a deal with McCabe,
and don't come back till you done it."
Hell, when they come upside
a mule like me, I feel sorry for 'em.
I do. I really do. I feel sorry for 'em.
I know what I'm doin'.
I know what I'm doin'.
What's he carrying around
that bloody blunderbuss with him for then?
I don't know. Maybe he come up here
to hunt possum.
You want a drink or not?
Uh, they said there was nothing to talk about.
-Who said?
-His name's Butler.
Christ, the son of a bitch
must be seven feet tall.
Well, uh, did you invite them here
for a meal, or –
Yeah.
But they said they were
gonna eat at Sheehan's.
Smalley, give me four or five
of them stogies, will you?
They couldn't make a deal if you wanted to.
They get paid for killing, nothing else!
McCabe, you gotta go with Webster –
Thank you, Smalley.
I'll tell everybody you've got business.
I'll tell 'em you got business
with the company, if you like.
Well, I guess if a man's fool enough
to get in business with a woman,
she ain't gonna think much of him.
You don't even know
where the wealth of this town is.
Chinkyville. That's where it is.
Right down there in Chinatown.
--I'll be with you in a minute.
Up in Canada right now,
they're blasting tunnel under $10 a foot,
all done with the pigtail.
They've got some new explosives up there.
Fantastic stuff!
They give it to Johnny Chinaman,
send him in,
down comes 45, 50 tons of rock
and one dead Chinaman.
But you, sir. Do you know what the fine is
for killing a Chinaman?
Fifty dollars, maximum.
The inspector's working for the company.
Four times out of five, it's an accident.
You could do this right here
with your own zinc.
All you gotta do is to
give the bugger a box of this stuff,
put him down the hole,
up to the rock face –
--and there's your zinc.
Sixty-five cents a ton.
Uh, you must be Butler, huh?
Sir?
I'm John McCabe.
I think we got some business to talk over.
-Do you smoke cigars?
-Yes, I do.
-Oh.
-Have one of mine.
Oh.
Uh, shall we step into the bar?
We can get a little privacy.
No, we're fine here.
Uh, Sheehan,
set up a bottle on me, will you?
Bottle.
Uh, about that deal –
You know, uh, when them –
when them gentlemen come up here
and make me that offer,
there were a whole lot of things
that we didn't take into consideration.
How much did they offer you?
McCABE: Well, uh, $5,500.
Well, they came up 750 from that,
so it's, uh, 6,250 they offered me.
Got that.
6,250.
Yeah, but how much did you ask them for?
Uh, well, we never got around to that
'cause, uh, I –
Oh, I might have mentioned something
like $12,000, $10,000, something like that.
It was just to get 'em bargaining,
you know.
And to, uh –
Well, just so's they'd talk sense.
Yeah, but how much did you really want?
Uh, well, that depends.
I mean, they's talkin'
about all my holdings, um –
8,000?
$8,000.
Well, uh, 7,500.
Probably more like it – more right.
You weren't very far apart, were you?
Oh, hell, no!
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I don't know what they mean
by all my holdings.
All my holdings – Does that mean, uh,
my horses, my clothes, my underwear?
I don't know what it means.
Uh, well, the fact is, uh, shit,
I'd be willing to make a deal for 6,250,
if they don't count my personal property in that.
I mean, that's provided that they
buy my inventory separately.
How much is that?
Well, 350.
300. 300.
And so you've got, uh, your 300, 6,250 –
So that's...
6,550.
6,550.
Well, let's just make that an even 6,500,
and you've got yourself a deal.
I don't make deals.
Uh, well, what you doing up here
if you don't make deals?
I came up here to hunt bear.
- I hear it's very good around here.
- Oh, get off!
Bear.
Uh –
Uh, y-y-you don't work
for Harris and Shaughnessey?
Sometimes.
Only when they can't make a deal.
Well, look,
that's what I'm trying to tell you.
This here deal can be made.
Not with me.
Well – Hmm.
I guess what I got to do
is get in touch with this fellow, Sears.
I'll see you boys later.
McCabe.
Were you ever called Pudgy?
A long time ago. Why?
My best friend's best friend
was Bill Roundtree.
Did you kill him?
I was in a poker game when he got shot,
but, uh, I didn't kill him.
Are you calling his best friend a liar?
Wait a minute.
I ain't calling nobody a liar.
Bill Roundtree got caught
marking the queens.
He went for his gun
and he got shot, that's all.
I'm going to count 10.
If you are not on that bridge
by the time I'm finished,
I'm going to get very cross with you.
All right.
I just want you boys to know
that, uh, I ain't wearing no gun.
Patty, come here.
Who the hell was this Bill Roundtree?
Well, uh, he was real well-known.
I mean, who said he shot him?
I told you, everybody says
he shot him with a derringer.
That man?
That man never killed anybody.
All the time making me feel like
I'm gonna make a fool out of myself.
Now we're gonna see who the fools is.
Son of a bitches.
Never did fit in this goddamn town.
God, I hate when them bastards
put their hands on you.
I tell you, sometimes,
sometimes when I take a look at you,
I just keep looking and looking.
I wanna feel your little body
up against me so bad,
I think I'm gonna bust.
I keep trying to tell you
in a lot of different ways.
Just one time you could be sweet
without no money around.
I think I could –
Well, I'll tell you something.
I got poetry in me.
I do! I got poetry in me, but...
I ain't gonna put it down on paper.
I ain't no educated man.
I got sense enough not to try.
Can't never say nothing to you.
If you'd just one time
let me run the show, I'd –
You're just freezing my soul,
that's what you're doing.
Freezin' my soul.
Well, shit! Enjoy yourself, girl.
Just go ahead and have a time.
What the hell.
That's just my luck.
The only woman that's ever been one to me
ain't nothin' but a whore.
But what the hell.
I never was a percentage man.
I suppose a whore
is the only kind of woman I'd know.
Uh, excuse me, ma'am.
Um, is this fellow,
Eugene Sears, still here?
No, he left this morning.
Mm-hmm. Uh –
Another fellow was with him,
uh, by the name of Ernie.
-Mr. Hollander.
-Hollander. That's right.
-Uh, I wonder if, uh, he's still here.
-No, he went with him.
Well, thank you all the same.
The law is here to protect
the little guy like yourself, McCabe.
And I'm at your service, free of charge.
-Free?
-That's what I said.
You don't have to pay me anything.
It would be an honor for the next senator
from the state of Washington
to be your servant
before the scales of justice.
Oh, that's mighty decent of you.
I don't know what –
When a man, McCabe –
When a man goes into the wilderness
and with his bare hands
gives birth to a small enterprise,
nourishes it and tends it while it grows,
I'm here to tell you that no dirty sons of bitches
are gonna take it away from him.
-Now, ain't that right?
-Well, I – I –
You're damn right it's right.
Now you take that there company,
Harris and Shaughnessey.
They have stockholders.
Now, do you think they want
their stockholders and the public
thinking that their management
isn't imbued with all the principles
of fair play and justice,
the very values that make
this country what it is today?
Uh-huh.
Busting up these trusts and monopolies
is at the very root of the problem
of creating a just society.
Damn it, McCabe, I'm here to tell you
that this free enterprise system
of ours works.
And working within it,
we can protect the small businessman
and the big businessman as well.
Well, I'll just didn't want to get killed.
Until people stop dying for freedom,
they ain't gonna be free.
I can see it now on the front page
of The Washington Post,
right next to a picture
of William Jennings Bryan.
"McCabe strikes a blow for the little guy."
You're gonna become
a famous man, McCabe.
We can find ourselves having dinner
with William Jennings Bryan.
-Well, I –
-You're gonna be a hero.
Aw, come on.
You're gonna stare 'em down
and make them quake in their boots.
Mm-hmm. Well, uh –
What do we do?
We get the marshal and, uh –
-No?
-You don't need the marshal.
We're gonna do this through the courts.
Well, now, I guess
what you're saying is that
we get this thing in the papers
and in the courts and all that,
well, they just can't afford to kill me.
-Is that right?
-You're damn right that's right.
They won't be able
to lift one little finger against you.
There comes a time in every man's life,
Constance, when he just...
got to stick his hand in the fire
and, uh – and, uh, see
what he's made out of.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about busting up
these trusts and monopolies.
That's what I'm talking about.
Somebody's got to protect the small
businessman from these big companies,
and I'm gonna be the man.
Constance, just 'cause
we ain't never talked about it
don't mean I ain't got,
uh, certain principles.
I know it don't mean nothing to you,
but I got a reputation in this town.
-These people –
-What's Presbyterian Church to you?
You're just gonna sell out!
Just sell out and go someplace
where people are civilized.
They'll get you, McCabe.
They'll get you.
And they'll do something awful to you.
Now, now, little lady,
ain't nothing gonna happen to me.
Don't you give me
any of that "little lady" shit!
I don't care about you!
Just give me my $1,500! I wanna make a deal.
If you're not gonna make a deal with them,
then I'll make a deal with them!
Make a deal?
You can't make no deal.
Bye, honey.
-I'm gonna miss you.
-Yeah. I'm gonna miss you too.
-Have a nice trip. Be a good boy.
-Don't worry. I will.
Bye. Say bye to Mrs. Miller for me.
Okay, good-bye.
Look after yourself.
--Be careful.
Oh, yeah.
Come back.
- Bye, cowboy. Come back!
- I will.
There's Shorty! Come on.
- Bye, cowboy.
I wasn't trying to hit it.
The trick is not to hit it,
but to make it float.
-Hey, hold it, sonny.
-What?
Hold up on your target practice a minute.
I don't wanna get shot.
Well, then get off the bridge,
you saddle tramp.
I want to buy some socks.
I've got a long ride ahead of me.
What's wrong with the socks you got on?
I wore 'em out running around half naked
in that whorehouse over there.
That's really quite a place.
You been there yet?
Take off your boots and show me.
You're joshing me.
I said take off your boots
and show me, you egg sucker.
I ain't gonna do that.
What are you wearing that gun for?
Nothing. I just wear it.
Can't hit nothing with it.
Well, that don't make no sense.
What kind of a gun is it?
-A Colt.
-Them's good guns.
That's what I got.
-There must be something wrong with it.
-No, it's me. I just can't shoot good.
Well, let me see it.
Come on. Maybe I can fix it for you.
Okay.
Constance?
You're the best-looking woman I ever saw.
And I ain't never tried to do nothin'
but put a smile on your face.
I ain't no good at saying I'm sorry.
I, uh –
I don't know what it is.
I guess I ain't never been
this close to nobody before.
- Hey.
Why don't you get under the covers, huh?
-Hey, Constance.
-Yeah, yeah.
You don't need to say nothin'.
I'm sorry.
Come on.
