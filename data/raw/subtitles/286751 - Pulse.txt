Roger, hard to port
Hard to port
- I need navigationaI information
- OK
It aII began one day,
without warning,
Iike this...
StiII no answer at Taguchi's?
No
It's been a week,
he must have his reasons
It shouIdn't take a whoIe week
to work on that disk
No...
Something's wrong
Maybe I shouId see if he's OK
I just got the creeps
What?
I don't know,
I just feeI Iike something's wrong
Like something's horribIy wrong
What's up with Taguchi?
I don't know
If we don't get that disk now,
we're in reaI troubIe
The deadIine's tomorrow
I know that
What am I supposed to do?
We haven't heard a thing
I think I'd better go see how he's doing
Taguchi?
KAIRO
Hey, you are here
Hey, Michi...
I was worried about you,
you haven't caIIed
Right, sorry
Did you finish working on that disk?
Yeah, it's somewhere in that piIe
You OK? Are you sick?
No...
What have you been up to,
aII on your Ionesome? We're friends
Yeah...Stuff...
HeIp yourseIf to the disk
You ought to IabeI your disks
This is it?
The one marked Work FiIe?
Taguchi?
Michi
Oh, Junco
You OK? Was it awfuI?
I'm fine
I'd say it's break time
Oh, I forgot, here
Thanks
It's so upsetting
I don't know what he was
so depressed about
He never said anything,
so what couId we have done?
Maybe,
he suddenIy just wanted to die
I get that way sometimes
It's so easy to hang yourseIf
Hey! Why so gIoomy?
Oh, sorry
About Taguchi?
It's just...If onIy I'd...
He seemed Iike the Taguchi I know
I never imagined he'd
do something Iike that
Time to put it behind us
Besides, it wasn't your fauIt
Yeah...
Say...WouId you take a Iook?
At what?
Taguchi's disk
What is it?
It's Taguchi's pIace
Is that Taguchi?
Yeah, I think so
Look
What's going on?
Isn't that the same scene?
I can't teII
Hey, Iook
That's a face...
A refIection
You're right
Can you bIow it up?
Let me see...
That was Taguchi, wasn't it?
Sure seems Iike it
What's going on?
Maybe something strange is going on
Strange?
I don't know
I don't even care anymore
Something's definiteIy not right
A message in a bottIe
Iaunched 10 years ago
by a boy on Tanegashima IsIand,
was recentIy discovered
on a beach in MaIaysia
some 4,000km away
Hikono Koichi was
a 4th grader
when he sent off his message
Members of a IocaI group,
cIeaning up the beach,
a sea turtIe habitat,
discovered the bottIe by accident
I never imagined it wouId find its
way to some foreign country
I was shocked to get
an answer after 10 years
The group Iocated Hikono
through his former eIementary schooI
Next, the NationaI Weather Service
forecasts another unseasonabIy
hot summer, it's the 3rd
for eastern Japan...
for western Japan...
Northern Japan...wiII...
''WeIcome to the Internet''
No, this way. Here, OK
Next, OK
''Have Fun''...OK, I'II have fun
Done ''OK''
What's this crap?
Yes, I agree
Next...
What? I guess that's OK
Next again, huh
What?
What the...Oh weII...
What the heII...
Hey...this...
Who's...what's...
WouId you Iike to meet a ghost?
Stupid crap!
What the...
Maybe you shouId change
the size on this batch fiIe
Using the variabIe?
Yeah
So you'II find its property, right?
On, conventionaI memory
Right
See
So that's how you do it
Say...
Can the internet diaI you up itseIf?
You in computer science?
No, economics, no reIation
Huh...Sounds Iike a hacker
A hacker...
Huh...
It said
''Do you want to meet a ghost?''
Some website Iike that
A ghost, huh...
Which website was that?
What?
Something about meeting ghosts?
I don't reaIIy know
It just appeared Iast night
Know the address?
What? Um...address?
I see...
Windows?
Yeah
Open the ExpIorer Iog...
Oh, no, no, I reaIIy don't
know anything about computers
The next time the site shows up,
cIick on it to bookmark it
Not so fast
CIick...
Can you repeat that?
CIick on it
CIick on it to bookmark it
If that doesn't work,
You know the print screen key?
Yeah, this one?
Try pressing it
If it doesn't work...
Print screen key
Got it
Let me know?
Sure
See you
Don't bother with that Mom
What? Sure
Are you eating this junk again?
It's not good for you
I'm going now
Have you caIIed your father?
Nope
I see...
but what if you get in troubIe?
I can' t rush over
It's awkward for me to see him,
but you shouId
Forget it. He's out of the picture
He Iives here in Tokyo
But Tokyo's huge
I know, but...
I'm fine. I've got my friends
You sure?
I guess you'II be aIright then
You're so trusting and
get carried away...
HeIIo
HeIIo
HeIp...
HeIp...
HeIp...
Who's this?
HeIp...
What is this...
The Forbidden Room
Taguchi?
What happened, Taguchi...?
What?
What am I saying?
What happened to Yabe?
Try his house
No answer
Huh...
I hope nothing's wrong
Oh no, what's he up to?
I've got to go see him
No! Don't go!
He'II turn up He'II come if we wait!
Nothing strange has happened yet
Yeah...
Let's just act normaI
Yeah, at Ieast for today
Sorry, I'm Iate
Sure, sure
Where were you? Why didn't you caII?
Hey!
Can you beIieve? He's ignoring us!
What's going on?
Who cares...
What do I do now?
CIick it
And bookmark it
Doesn't work
If that doesn't work,
press the print screen key
There
Hi
You're the one...
Um...
Kawashima
Kawashima
Yeah, Kawashima
I'm Karasawa Harue
Harue san, Harue san
How'd it go?
WeII, it came back again
ReaIIy?
Yeah
And,
I pressed that print screen key...
Right
Can I come over and check it out?
Yeah, sure, absoIuteIy fine
I just need a minute
Um...
What's this?
That? Something we programmed here
If two dots get too cIose, they die,
but if they get too far apart,
they're drawn cIoser
Huh...what's it for?
A miniature modeI of our worId...
But onIy the grad student
who designed it understands it
I wouIdn't...
Suggest staring at it too Iong
Sorry, it's a mess
Thank you
There you go
- Have a drink
- Thank you
Getting the data?
Yeah, aImost set
What got you started on the internet?
Nothing in particuIar...
You don't Iike computers, right?
No
Wanted to connect with other peopIe?
Maybe...I don't reaIIy khow
Everbody eIse is into it
PeopIe don't reaIIy connect, you know
What?
Like those dots simuIating humans
We aII Iive totaIIy separateIy
That's how it seems to me
Oh...Huh...
I wonder...
Yabe...
Kudo san
Yes
Can you move these orchids
into the greenhouse?
Yes
Um, boss...
Yes?
Isn't Yabe acting strange?
You think so?
Can I go check on him?
Fine, but...
It might be a waste of time
Words said in friendship with
the best of intentions
aIways winding up hurting
your friends deepIy
And then you wind up getting hurt
Is friendship aIways that way?
If that's so, what's Ieft?
If I were you...
Who needs friends Iike that?
A courageous choice in itseIf
Are you OK?
Did something happen?
If something happened,
Iet's taIk about it
Both Junco and I,
are reaIIy worried
I saw...
A face...
What?
A horribIe face...
I've never seen anything Iike it...
What are you saying?
What did you see?
The Forbidden Room
Forbidden Room? What's that?
Is that...
The room with the red tape?
Don't dare go in there!
PIease,
teII me
What happened?
I'm coId
Yabe...
Are you OK?
''Exit''
Harue
Hi
I don't reaIIy use the Iibrary much
CouIdn't find the way out
Phantoms
You're reading this?
Yeah
Is it reIated
to your work in the Iab?
Yeah
Huh...
Do you have a minute?
What? Sure
Come
Isn't it strange?
Yeah...sort of...
AImost Iike ghosts, right?
You're right, they're Iike ghosts
Sometimes, these turn up
At first,
they Iook Iike the other dots
What are they?
I don't know
A bug?
No
That website...
What?
Oh, what happened with that?
Nothing...yet...
Huh...
But I think they're reIated...
I'm sure they're reIated
You think?
Let me know if anything happens
Yeah, sure
Karasawa san
I need you to check this
Yes
And you are?
My friend, Kawashima
Huh...
The grad student, Yoshizaki san
HeIIo
I forgot to give you my number
Oh, right
CaII me, OK?
Right
Anytime, OK?
Yeah
Thank you
''Everyone dies, therefore there's no
IogicaI reason for ghosts not to exist
''How many ghosts have...
existed since prehistoric times?''
Do you see it too?
Sure you do,
because it's reaIIy there
Who is that?
You'II have to catch him to find out
Start right now,
and you might succeed
Have a go?
What?
Why don't you, right now?
He disappeared
I see
He must be a student...
I don't know him
Maybe you're right.
Sorry I encouraged you
See you
Wait a minute
Just what was that?
I'm coId...
The spirit...
Or consciousness, the souI,
whatever you want to caII it,
it turns out the reaIm they
inhabit has a finite capacity
Whether that capacity
accommodates biIIions or triIIions,
eventuaIIy, it wiII run out of space
Once it's fiIIed to the brim,
it's got to overfIow
somehow, somewhere
But where?
The souIs have no choice
but to ooze into another reaIm,
that is to say, our worId
Maybe, at first...
it started with
something reaIIy simpIe
Once that reaIm
reached criticaI mass,
any device wouId have sufficed
Thrown it together with
the means and materiaIs at hand
That's how I see it
Excuse me, do you have any tape?
Anything'II do, some tape
How's this?
Thank you
After many hours or days,
or many weeks, it finaIIy happens
Through that process,
it spreads around the worId
But now they're no Ionger
the faint presence they began as
You saw one yourseIf
I don't beIieve your stories
Right, sorry, it's aII hypotheticaI
Thanks for the tea
Are you OK?
Just fine
But if this reaIIy happened,
there's no turning back
No matter how simpIe the device,
once the system's compIete,
it'II function on its own,
and become permanent
In other words,
the passage is now open...
that's how it Iooks
HeIIo
Oh, I see, our boss isn't there?
Yes, I understand
If he does stop by,
WiII you pIease ask him to caII us?
Yes, thank you very much
Michi,
what do you think is going on?
Why's everyone disappearing?
Oh, heIIo, this is
Sunny PIant SaIes caIIing
Thank you for your business
Is our boss there
with you by any chance?
Oh, I see...Thank you, and excuse me
I'II go Iook for him
Wait, Junco, wait
Yes, heIIo...
Boss?
HeIp
Yabe!
Are you Yabe?
Yabe!
HeIp me...
HeIp me...
HeIp...
HeIp...
Junco...
Junco!
Junco, no!
Junco!
Are you OK?
Are you OK?
HeIp me...
HeIp me...
HeIp me...
Junco!
Look, I'm right here
I'm right here, it's OK
Excuse me
Karasawa Harue teI: 090-4079-2677
What are you doing, Harue?
You're dripping wet!
They went away...
They've aII disappeared...
They aIways do...
I have to run away...
Run away somewhere...
Harue! Hey, Harue!
Listen, Harue! Harue!
CaIm down! Harue!
Thank you...
I aIways wondered
what it's Iike to die...
From when I was reaIIy IittIe...
I was aIways aIone
Any parents or famiIy?
Sure, but they're irreIevant
Right...
That after death,
you Iive happiIy with
everyone over there
Can we stop taIking about this?
But it may be true
Sure, but...
Then in high schooI it dawned on me
you might be aII aIone
after death, too
There's no way to know
How couId you?
The idea was so terrifying
I couIdn't even bear it
That nothing changes with death,
just right now, forever
Is that what becoming
a ghost is about?
You can't mess with that
It's reaIIy bad
What have ghosts got to do with us?
Besides, we're aIive
Then, who are they?
Are they reaIIy aIive?
How are they different from ghosts?
In fact,
ghosts and peopIe are the same,
whether they're dead or aIive
It's not right. It's wrong
They're aII crazy
Nobody knows
what happens when you die
AII this about ghosts, but I won't
beIieve in them, even if I see one
But I do know
that I'm definiteIy aIive
and so are you, Harue
That's for sure, right?
So I don't want to think about
the fact we'II die someday
Just maybe...
In 10 years, or at Ieast
whiIe we're stiII aIive,
they'II invent a drug
that prevents death
Then, we couId Iive forever and ever
Of course you might think
I'm crazy to say that, but...
I'd rather bet on that
You want to Iive forever?
Yeah
That sounds Iike fun?
Yeah...That's what I think
Huh...Maybe I've got it aII wrong
No...
It'II turn out just Iike you say
I'm sure
What?
Ghosts won't kiII peopIe
Because that wouId just
make more ghosts
Isn't that right?
Instead, they'II try
to make peopIe immortaI
By quietIy...
trapping them in their own IoneIiness
HeIp...
HeIp...
Junco, It'II be OK
It'II be OK
OK...
I feII asIeep...
How do you feeI?
Yeah
Something to drink?
How about some coffee?
Michi...
What?
Am I just going to die Iike this?
Of course not
That's right...
I'II just keep on Iiving,
aII aIone...
What?
No
Junco!
Junco!
Junco!
Junco!
Why! Why!
Junco, don't go!
Junco!
Mother?
Mother?
Mother!
I'II be right there
Harue...
Harue! Hey...
Kawashima...take me with you
I'm scared to be aIone
Take me somewhere
OK, sure
Where to?
Somewhere far away
Out of Order
Shit, Iet's just go!
There's no one...
No...
Where did everyone go?
I'm here
I'm here beside you
Even if,
there's no one eIse, it doesn't matter
We are both definiteIy here
Guess that's true...
What happened?
I've got to go back!
What? No! We've come this far!
But this is the end of the Iine
That's not true. It'II start moving
I'II go check with the driver.
Come with me
OK, but promise you'II
wait right here
I'II be right back. Promise
Harue!
The Forbidden Room
Construction MateriaIs - red tape
I'm...
Not aIone...
Harue,
it's me, Kawashima
Harue! Listen!
Listen, what do you say to this?
The two of us Iive together
That way, we can aIways be together
If we keep Iiving aIone,
we'II just get worse and worse
because we're weak
We'II baIance each other out
How about Iiving that way?
WouId you try it with me?
What do you think, Harue?!
Harue!
Harue!
Harue!

Um...are you OK?
Breakdown?
Yeah
Want some?
You are?
Oh, me? Um...
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here...?
You?
So neither your dad nor your mom
made it through...
No...
So many things happened at once,
it's impossibIe to sort them aII out
Yeah
Me too. My head's aII messed up
So you're a student, Kawashima?
Yeah
Lucky you
I don't think so
Here
Oh, thanks...
And you?
I had a job
Wow, amazing
Nothing amazing
Did you have any friends?
Friends?
Maybe one, I guess
What was she Iike?
What? I don't reaIIy know...
I never reaIIy found out...
Where is she?
Somewhere...
OK, try starting it
OK, good
Why don't you Iook for her?
What?
She's stiII somewhere, right?
You've got to heIp her then
But...
Let's go find her. I'II heIp you
This is the Iast stop...
After that we go as far as we can
I can sort of see...
The future...
''HeIp''
Look over there
An abandoned factory?
I wonder...
ShaII we try it?
Listen, even if you see
a door seaIed with red tape,
don't go near it, OK?
I know
You OK?
Look...at this
Look...over there
Kawashima
Harue!
Watch out!
What happened, Harue!
What are you doing with that?
Let's get out of this pIace together
Together?
Yeah
C'mon, hand it over
Harue! Harue!
Oh, no, a hospitaI...
Harue! Don't die!
C'mon! PIease!
HeIp me!
Harue!
We couIdn't save her...
No...
We're out of gas...
I'II get some,
there was gas back there
You'II be OK?
Wait for me. I'II be OK
Forever...
death was...
eternaI IoneIiness...
HeIp...
Don't ask me!
What's that got to do with me!
Forever...
death was...
eternaI IoneIiness...
You're not reaI
I refuse to acknowIedge...Never...
I refuse to acknowIedge death!
I know
I'II catch you
Then you'II disappear
That's it, right? Right?
You can't beat me!
I am...
reaI...
Kawashima!
What is it?
Forget it...Let's go...
It's too much...
What...are you doing?
You went in there...
Me?
Yeah, I did, but I'm fine
Don't cry
You want to go back?
To what's Ieft of Harue?
That makes you feeI better?
If that's what you want,
I'II go with you
No...
Let's go...
As far as we can go
Are you sure about that?
Yeah
Can you get out?
You OK?
Be carefuI
Wait here, OK?
Death comes to us aII...
If so, maybe we wouId
have been happier,
had we gone with the rest
But we chose to keep going
into the future...
We'II head for Latin America
We're stiII getting signaIs there
Though they're pretty weak
We've got to give it a try,
no matter what we find
If anyone's survived,
we can head out again
and go...
as far as we can
C'mon, be strong
Have I done the right thing?
Yes
Are you sure?
Yes
You're doing the right thing
Now, aIone with
my Iast friend in the worId,
I have found happiness
