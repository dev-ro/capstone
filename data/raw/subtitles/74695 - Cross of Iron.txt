This is Regiment 2 headquarters
calling Corporal Steiner
Can you pick me up, Steiner?
Steiner, can you hear me?
Good kill!
Look, my new weapon
Not for yourself
They're ammunition
Your hat
Ralf
Look at that
Nothing we haven't seen before
Steiner
Look what I found running around
in the back. A Russian fledging
Put it down
Quickly!
We go
If you can get Meyer, tell him
we need transportation from
Checkpoint 7
Right
Bring him with us
Push, push, push, push!
Come on, come on!
Quickly!
Alright, stop
This damned country!
It's certainly new adventure but
I have a feeling that one of
these days this land will swallow us up
Captain Stransky, sir
I'm Brandt, you're welcome
Thank you, sir
This is my adjutant
Captain Kiesle
Captain, how are you?
Thanks for asking, Captain
I feel terrible. I've got diarrhea
How are you?
You should meet your adjutant
Lieutenant Triebig
He's also a new arrival
Won't you join us
in a glass of wine?
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir
Take my coat, please
Yes, sir
My respect, Colonel
A 1937 Moselle in the
southernmost corner of Russia?
Remarkable!
A bottle of Mosells is no more
out of place in this region
than we are ourselves
Your health, gentlemen
I'm not gonna drink to my health
It's not worth drinking to
To the end of the war?
Colonel, why does our presence
here strike you as so absurd?
Captain, why did you ask to be
released from duty in France?
I want to get the Iron Cross
We can give one of mine
No, no, I'm just joking
Actually it's exactly what my
commanding officer in France
asked me, I can't stop you
he said
Since I'm convinced that
without you
the eastern front would collapse
in a matter of days
Go ahead, you heroic horse's ass
Heroic horse's ass!
His exact words!
I withdraw my toast to the
end of the war
To heroic horse's asses
everywhere
To the patient flash
Colonel, I would like to make
something quite clear to
Captain Kiesle?
I volunteered for this campaign
because I feel that men of
quality are needed here
It is time to destroy the myth of
Russian invincibility
Just how do we do that?
Reinforcing morale, punishing
those who're insubordinate
and rebellious
instilling a new respect
for ranking officers
Low morale goes hand in hand
with defeat after defeat
followed by impending defeat
Now you are new to our
Russian fronts
I don't blame you for talking
like a horse's ass
Of course, sir, I'm not familiar
with the Russian front yet
but I firmly don't believe that the
ideals of the German soldier even
The German soldier does not
have any ideals
He's not fighting for the country
or the rest
not for one formal government
at once
not for the stinking parties
He's fighting for his life
God bless him
But sir, I am a solder and as
a soldier I feel it is my duty to
subordinate my own ideas
to the principles of my country
right or wrong
Colonel Brandt, Lieutenant
Meyer, sir
Yes?
Steiner's on his way back
What sort of the shape are
they in?
The usual!
Very well, I see
I want a briefing as soon
as they're rested
Yes, sir
And Meyer, Captain Stransky
is here
He's informed of our situation
Yes, sir
Steiner's back
Of course
Who's Steiner?
To you in some ways
he could be a problem
but he's a first rate soldier
So we look the other way
Anything to add to that, Kiesle?
Steiner is a myth
Men like him are our last hope
and in that sense he's truly
a very dangerous man
Well, I' II see
Colonel, with your permission
Well, what do you think of
our new captain?
I think he think he's on
some kind of a special mission
that is to achieve spiritual
domination of the battalion
thereby symbolizing the purity
of the great German Weimarer itself!
Everyone going down in the feast
If they're the last of Steiner
then God help us!
Captain Stransky, welcome to
the second platoon
Lieutenant
Meyer, captain
My, Captain, I'm to show
you your quarters
brief you on our current situation
Where's my bunker?
Down there, in front of
the factory, sir
The second platoon has got
here first
Where are they?
They're just returning from
reconnaissance, sir
Who's in charge of it?
Corporal Steiner, sir
Ah! What is so special about
this Corporal Steiner?
Early in the Novorssysk attack
Corporal Steiner saved
Colonel Brandt's life
Ah!
And mine, too
Interesting
Corporal Steiner!
I'm Captain Stransky
I'm your new commander
Yes, sir
Who' s this?
Corporal Schnurrbart, sir
And the other one?
That is a Russian prisoner, sir
You know as well as I do
that there are orders that
no Russian prisoners are
to be taken
Get rid of him
How, sir?
Well, shoot him!
You shoot him, sir
I will, on this spot
Then I' II deal with you
No need, I' II see that
he's taken care of, sir
I want to see you in
my bunker, one hour
with your full report, clear?
Of course, sir
Corporal Steiner?
I'm Lily Marlin
Come here, son
Steiner! I want to show you
what our new army looks like
What' s your name, son?
Private Dietz, sir
They're sending us babies now
Hello, chap?
Private Dietz
How long have you been
soldiering?
Six weeks, sir
I volunteered, sir
Don't volunteer for
anything around here
Kern and Kruger here
and myself
Do exactly what we says and
you' II be wearing your boots
up to your ass for a long time
Clear?
Yes, sir!
And don't call me sir
Excuse me
Go with this foul smelling one
over here
Show his bunker
Kern, see if you can find a
jacket or a blanket
something for the boy
They must have something
over there
Yes, sir!
Oh, excuse me
Stand at ease
Thank you, sir
Here's the report
Thank you
I regret the incident
this afternoon, Corporal
but orders are orders
We have enough trouble
with feeding of our own troops
without taking prisoners
Anyway, it's bad for security
I've read your preliminary report
It gives me great pleasure
to inform you that
Colonel Brandt and I have
agreed to recommend you for
promotion to Senior Sergeant
effective at once
Your promotion doesn't seem to
have made much of an impression
No, it doesn't
Alright, I read your report
Anything to add to this?
Russians, sir, we should be
hearing from them very soon, sir
Offensive?
Yes, I should think so
Starting when?
Soon
What about your platoon?
Two killed, one missing
Two killed, how?
Bullets, a lot of fire, artillery
heavy salable, bad luck
general misfortunes
usual things, Captain
The missing man, did you
look for him, Steiner?
No, sir
Why not?
I felt that it would have been
irresponsible of me to risk
the safety of entire platoon
for the sake of one man
You felt what?
Noncommissioned officer
does not permit a missing men
in such a case, in any case!
I' II try to do better next time, sir
I'd like to have that in writing
If you wish
You know, Corporal, Sergeant
I have a feeling you somewhat
overestimate your importance
At the moment, I am free
of any such illusions, sir
Well, may I suggest you that
you do not underestimate
your present company?
Everything you are and
may become is dependent
upon this present company
No, I would not forget that, sir
but may I add man is generally
what he feels himself to be
Of course, of course
You're dismissed
I should be back soon, sir
Is that a salute?
Yes, sir
Triebig!
Yes, sir
You must be careful, Steiner
He's taken strong dislike to you
I' II survive
You're not dealing with just
another Nazi party diver
This one is pure impression
of military aristocracy enriched
Hey, why are you bringing
in the apples?
To eat it, you idiot!
You know the ruling classes
Come now, lieutenant
What's left to rule?
Don't be naive
Stransky will survive
this war one way or another
and he' II still have
his land his wealth
and his status
But it will be very
dangerous in defeat
Be careful, Captain
He doesn't live in
the same world we live in
I know, he's living in
my world now
Yeah, sure
Lieutenant!
Yeah
Please, would you come
inside for a minute?
Something I'd like
to show you
Kern, don't just stand there
drinking, help us!
Thank you, I didn't realize
You forget we're in
reconnaissance platoon?
Happy birthday,
Lieutenant Meyer
Yes!
Happy birthday!
Explain that to Captain's orderly
so that he doesn' t make
any mistakes, will you?
Be careful with your uniform
Russian vodka,
German wine chickens
Oh, Maag, I don't know how
I stayed alive so long
He's the best scavenger
in the entire regiment
Cheers to all of you
Cheers! Cheers!
Here's to the last Russian bullet
Yeah!
Here's to survival
Yeah, yeah
Here's to your wife,
girlfriend women!
Yeah! Women!
Here's to the women
of Follybassier
To the girls of Rivavant!
Oh la la!
Gently, gently
Come on, fill it up
Here's to Dietz's virginity
May your cause ride with him
as a new assistant to Triebig
All you have to do is
just play noble
Oh, yeah, here comes the cake
Oh, cake!
Captain Stransky should see this
Captain who?
Here's to the cake
Cake!
Stop it! Stop it!
What's everyone doing here?
What do you think
we're doing here?
Playing birthday games right
in the middle of all that shit?
Come on...
You shut up! I'm talking!
You want a party?
Okay, fine! Catch on!
Take it easy
Okay, there's a bullet for you
to fire up your assholes!
Come on!
You don't touch me
You stink like a shit!
Come on Let's don't
spoil everything
He's still gonna have
his birthday
Happy birthday, Lieutenant
Have a good party
I' II have some more vodka
Yeah, fill it up
Here's some vodka for everybody
I'm sorry
It's alright
Alright, now Lieutenant Meyer
is to have a meeting with
our lustrous new commander
Captain Stransky
whom we' II all meet shortly
This is not a funeral, gentlemen
This is a birthday party
Now let's drink! We' II have
a song, what the hell!
Thank you, sir
Where were you stationed
before you joined the battalion?
In the south of France, Biarritz
I know it well, sit down,
sit down tell me about it
Such a beautiful country
And being transferred
must have come hard?
I applied for it as you did, sir
As I did?
That's interesting
And your orderly?
We served together
In the south of France?
Ah, those French girls!
Comme elle sont delicieuses
Those French girls, Triebig!
I did not have much time to
think about those French girls
Really? And you Keppler?
Did you enjoy the French girls?
On occasion
Sur le pont d'Avignon
on y danse, on y danse
Let me ask you a question,
Triebig you like soldiering?
Certainly, I like it, sir
but it's strange at times
It is indeed a very
different world
A world of danger
and a world of men
a world without women
hm, Keppler?
Yes
A world without women
Thank you
It's an old theory of mine
Men can get along without
women easily, easily I tell you
A man's true destiny is not
just breeding children
child birth, and chocolate
but to be free, to rule
and fight, in other words
to lead a man's existence women
are no more than nuisance
sometimes, sometimes necessary
I'm a solder, sir. If I have to
I can do without women
Really?
And you Keppler?
Can you do without women?
I do as I am ordered, sir
I like that! I like that answer
I do as I am ordered
I like that
What is your first name?
Josef
Josef, Josef
If it will help you I' II put your
thoughts into the right words
You prefer a society of men
to that of women
at any and all situations
I don't understand, Captain
Come on, Triebig
You don't have to
put up a front with me
With me of all people
What I said was right, wasn't it?
You prefer a society of men
to that of women
Come on, we're all soldiers
There's no harm in it
Say yes, for heaven's sake
man, say yes!
Possibly
You said yes, you said yes!
He said yes, didn't he,
Keppler? He said yes!
You said yes, didn't he, Keppler?
He said yes, didn't he, Keppler?
Yes
Louder! Didn't he, Keppler?
Louder! Say yes, loud!
Yes!
Louder!
Yes!
Louder!
Yes!
I can assure you of this
If you get caught
you' II be hanged slowly
both of you!
Together!
Now get out of here
Ammunition supply's running low
Sector 3 needs more 9 millimeter
Service platoon not secure
Their own tech in short
Has 47 O casualties
By the way we didn't get the mail
It's a big one
Thank you
Oh, I see
Get your hands off my lice!
Melt!
Oh, not again!
Melt before body,
that's the rule
Sector 7, no activity
Get him outside
Kern, get yourself outside
Come on, quick
No, no, no, the Russians might
think it's mustard gas
The Geneva Convention forbids
the use of mustard gas
Goddamnit, Kern!
What type of exhaust
pipe do you have and
when was it broken?
I'm well organized and
without problems
Aren't you feeling guilty, Kruger?
Is that your natural smell?
Yes, yes I stay
dirty for a reason
If you've been in the field
as long as I have been
you'd know why
Explain
I learned after Stalingrad
Natural body oils combined
with dirt
can keep you waterproof
Waterproof?
Sure
How is it?
Quiet
Too quiet
Yes
Wait till the first light
What are we doing here?
We're spreading
the German culture
throughout a desperate world
Didn't someone say war is
the highest expression in life
of a truly cultured people?
Yes, a foolish wise man named
Friedrich von Bernhardi
Right!
Yeah!
And Clausewitz said?
Clausewitz? Uh, Clausewitz said
war is a continuation of
state policy
By other means!
Yes, by other means
Do you ever think about
your children?
Sure, always
Where are they?
I don't know
Take off one uniform, there's
always another underneath
Go!
It's all an accident
an accident of hands
mine, others-
all without mind
one extreme to another
and neither works
The will ever!
We stand in the middle
in no man's land
Go home, go home!
Steiner!
Yes, sir! Yes, sir?
This is a prox, Stransky
A prox, sir? It's an-
No, sir! It's an attack
the forest!
Sir, counter fight is
needed at once
We'd rather run,
pull him out!
I need help!
Stay calm, Stransky
You're not alone
What do you mean
I'm not alone, sir?
I am alone!
I am alone!
Steiner is gone
Triebig is gone
I don't know where
Lieutenant Meyer is
I don't know!
Dead? Is he dead?
Go to the battalion
sector and find them
And stand by and prepare
a counterattack as quickly as possible
Yes, sir! I will be
counterattacking, sir!
Stay in your position!
Damn it!
Get your all ammunition!
Where's Meyer?
On the wall, sir!
Get the ammunition!
Pull back! Get down, you fool!
You, get over there!
Get back to your post!
Get that phone fixed
Yes, sir
Put it back
Keep your positions!
Everybody keep firing!
Fire, Whitman, fire!
I need a headcover! Fire!
We're winning
We're winning!
Fire!
Where' s my headcover?
Where are my tanks?
Phone is ringing!
Meyer!
Captain Stransky
Where's your counterattack?
We are attacking!
We are defending!
We're counterattacking!
I'm wounded, sir
Can I continue?
I know what to do, sir
Don't worry
But I need ammunition!
Get Meyer!
Hurry up!
We must cover Steiner!
Look at me
Follow the light
with your eyes
Very good
Now look at me again
Sergeant!
Alright
Did you sleep well?
Reasonably
Smell?
Nothing
Any sense of taste?
Lmproving
Quite usual in concussion
You've been like this
for a week
The smell will turn soon
Your records indicate multiple
wounds over the last few years
Any residual effects?
Headaches, blood vision
I can't urinate out of my
left ear any longer
but otherwise I feel quite well
The doctors recommended
you stay with us
for another three weeks
until they've completed
your tests
then recommend home leave
Home
Schnurrbart?
Schnurrbart?
Attention!
General Fontessel!
Hello, soldier? How are you?
Tell me how you feel
This man has severe
concussion, sir
He's been army decorated
I want sixty five percent of
these men returned to active duty
in three days
Ah, food! Delicious!
Take the pig, the meat and
wine into the private dining room
Come! Eat! Eat, eat,
everybody! Everybody!
Vegetables are good for you
They're with the compliments
of the high commander
Everybody looks like someone
else around here
Did I have a bad spell?
Yeah, you were very violent
Violent?
Violence should stop
It must stop
Say violence must stop?
Let's have a celebration
Bring out some wine!
Oh, no, I'm on duty
Have a drink
No, I couldn't
They' II throw me out
Do you dance?
Hold my bottle
I' II hold your waist
and we dance
Listen, this is ridiculous
It's nice, very nice
Schnurrbart!
What the hell are you
doing here? Lost?
No such luck, bro
I got it in the leg same time
you got it in the head
Schnurrbart!
My vacation's over
It's back to the bad side of
old mother Russia
They took us all from
our hospital
It looks like we're picking up
some of your boys as well
You want to come along
or are you doing alright?
Attention, men!
Prepare to leave
Oatbrook! Hold this truck
What the hell are
you talking about?
That's an order, goddamnit!
Rolf, what is it?
What?
What's the matter?
I'm going back
I thought you were going
back home
I have no home
My home, our home
Do you love the war zone?
Is that... ls that what's wrong
with you, Steiner?
Are you afraid of what
you' II be without it?
Long live Germany
I said hold it!
I said hold it, right?
Steiner, I didn't mean
it you're crazy!
Schnurrbart
Rolf!
Son of a bitch!
Schnurrbart!
Hello, Kern!
Hartwick
Hello, Sergeant
Hartwick
Schnurrbart, how are you?
Caught you with your
pants down again, huh?
Anselm
Welcome back, Sergeant
Kruger!
You're back too soon
I don't want to talk to you
Leave me alone
Missed you, missed you, yeah!
My, my, my! What is this?
That's Zoll
That's a party member
It's a compliment of
Captain Stransky
He has special actions quote
You still a party
member Holibach?
Well, I' II dance with a party
member if I can find one
Hey, silence! Party's convinced
we're winning the war
Yeah, sure, we're
winning the war
I hope you've memorized
our serial numbers
our mothers' maiden
names correctly
I wouldn't want them to come and
rescue a wrong man, a woman or a child
I don't care what you
believe what you've done
Your duties to us,
the platoon and me
Fulfill those responsibilities or
you' II have our banners
up your ass, clear?
Yes, sir
I'm playing nursemaid
to Cersquot
Anyone volunteers?
Dinner, Steiner!
Not me
No time
Go along with Steiner
Thanks a lot
What have we here
a hawk and a hare?
I' II take it
Come on, have a drink
That's your bottle, cheers!
Some papers to sign, Captain
I' II sign them later
Stop that!
Be careful with my JJ
Yes, sir
Have her treated correctly
Sergeant Steiner reporting
as ordered, sir
Come in
Thank you, that will
be all gentlemen
Welcome back, Sergeant Steiner
Thank you, sir
Please sit down
Make yourself comfortable
Now that you're back
and I'm glad you're back
I think we should make a
fresh start together
but the main point is the
regiment feels or believes that
I deserve the Iron Cross now
And they've asked me to produce
two witnesses to the fact that
I led the counterattack and threw
the Russians out of their positions
I have named Lieutenant
Triebig and you
especially you
Lieutenant Triebig has already
submitted signature
You'd like to believe this is a
private conversation
That would occur to
you wouldn't it?
Alright, have some
wine a 37 Moselle
I' II have some
Thank you, Sergeant
But still remember that in civilian
as well as in military life
the distinction is made
between people
Is that what you meant
when you said all you are
and may become is dependent
upon this present company?
Well, the difference is
a matter of ethical
and intellectual superiority
which is caused whether
you like it or not by blood
and by class difference
If I remember correctly
Kant was a son of a saddle maker
and Schubert's father was
a poor schoolmaster
Perhaps talent, sensitivity
and character are no longer
privileges of the
so called upper class
But Kant and Schubert
were exceptions
We' re talking about
general concepts
not individuals
But I am one and so are you
Didn't Afior say that all class
distinction would be abolished?
I'm an officer of the Weimarer
I've never been a party member
I'm a Prussian aristocrat and
I don't want to be put into
the same category!
So we agree for once
Good!
But it is still Afior
Fortunately
It's a different question, Sergeant
That's not up to us to judge
Why do you want it so badly?
It's just a piece of
worthless metal, look!
It's not worthless to me
Why is it so important to you?
Tell me, Captain, why?
Sergeant, if I go back
without the Iron Cross
I couldn't face my family
Personally, sir, I don't feel
you deserve the Iron Cross
Where are you going?
I'm going to Point 124
Corporal Kruger's over there
Are you crazy? No one could
survive this kind of assault
Get out of my way!
Tell them I'm going out
Steiner!
You get me some
stretcher, damnit!
Steiner! Steiner!
The others?
Dead, all dead
God, listen to me
We're going to leave now
You're gonna get up and
follow me out of here
Alright?
The others
The others sat there
I by myself
I don't ever want to be
alone again
I don't ever want to be
alone again
You won't, you won't
Come on
Yeah
Why the hell wasn't I told
that Steiner has returned
to the battalion?
That was not priority, sir
There were more
important things to do
I want him here at once
A lot of predicament of which
I'm sure you don't want to be
reminded, clear, Stransky?
Quite clear, sir
Now we shall see
I don't like the tone
of his voice
I'm fed up with
the whole situation
Doesn't matter any more
I know from reliable sources
that headquarters had
already written off
to burn bridgehead
and soon the whole Crimea
will be a cul de sac
Report to Brandt
You have the choice, Triebig
between Biarritz and Siberia
What would you choose?
Steiner
Colonel
Sit down please, Sergeant
How was hospital?
Oh, interesting
I recommend it
Did Captain Stransky
lead the counterattack
the day Lieutenant
Meyer was killed?
Lieutenant Meyer led the attack
Captain Stransky was
nowhere in sight
You're sure of that?
I saw Lieutenant Meyer die
Fetch Triebig
Stay, I want you to listen
Sir?
You signed your Captain's report
Were you present when Captain
Stransky led the counterattack?
I accompanied Captain
Stransky to the field
and saw him calling several
men around him
Then he sent me back
to the command post
Then how do you know Captain
Stransky led the counterattack?
You've signed a statement
to that effect, Triebig
I wasn't there I learned of it from
wounded men who were returning
Can you give me the name of
one of these wounded men?
They weren't staff men
just company men
I knew them only by sight
Beside the slope and the
puddle have been on fire, sir
I want you to know, Triebig
that I have had your
statement checked
Captain Kiesle will inform you
of the results of our investigation
Our investigation
so far has disclosed
the men in second company
who took part in action
declared unanimously the action
was led by Lieutenant Meyer
None of them saw Captain
Stransky or Lieutenant Triebig
To my mind there is nothing
more contemptible than
stealing the laurels which
properly belong to the man
who was killed in action
If Sergeant Steiner stands by
his last testimony
I should be compelled to
institute disciplinary proceedings
against the Captain and you
Yes, sir
Do you stand by your statement
that Captain Stransky was
not with the company?
Would it be possible for me to give
my answer in three or four days sir?
Did you see Stransky or not?
You may go, Triebig
You're no longer needed
What in God's name has got
into you, this is your chance!
You are the only person who
stands between Stransky
and his Iron Cross
and you could be called as
a primary witness against him
in the court of honor
My differences with Captain
Stransky are a personal matter
Now listen to me
You know I've always shown a great
deal of understanding for you
but I'm becoming tired of
battling with your superiors
I never asked you to
Didn't ask me to?
You never asked me to?
Are you out of your mind?
Steiner, why are you
so ungrateful?
What do I have to be
grateful for, Captain?
Your tolerance?
Don't think that just because
you and Colonel Brandt are
more enlightened than most
officers that I hate you any less
I hate all officers, all the
Stranskys, all the Triebigs
all the Iron Cross scavengers
in the whole German army
Have you any idea
what you're saying?
Do you know how much
I hate this uniform
and everything it
stands for? God!
Get out! Please just get out!
Regimental headquarters
Ammunition headquarters, sir
General Von Canik talking
Colonel Brandt
Yes, General
Yes, it was as bad as that
I'm very sorry to hear
Well?
We're heading back to the
bridgehead in Kuman
No rear guard, not even
the second platoon
We' re not retreating
We're running
Captain Stransky
Yes, Captain Kiesle
I was just about to leave
Don't leave just yet
Now listen to me
Regiment feels that it is
unwise and also suicidal
to leave behind any rear guard
platoons including Steiner's
I want them to join the
evacuation immediately
You understand that?
Yes, Captain
Triebig, all real guard platoons
to join the evacuation immediately
Shall I notify Steiner's platoon?
Yes
Give me Steiner
Calling Regiment
Regimental headquarters
come in, please!
Regimental headquarters!
Come in, please!
Regimental headquarters
come in, please!
B company, can you hear me?
Anybody come in, please!
Tanks!
Can you hear me?
Kruger!
All the lines are out
Move! Down the tunnel! Out!
Fire!
Zoll, grab some mines
Pick them up, quick!
On the tracks
Put them on the tracks
Hurry, hurry!
Get into the factory!
Over to the factory!
Move, damnit!
Hurry, coming in from
both sides
Kern, up above!
Kruger, up on the catwalk!
Down the tunnel!
Anselm, dynamite!
It's coming in!
Shit!
Jesus Christ!
Steiner, let's go!
It's clear
Come on, move!
Captain Pukher reporting, sir
Ah, yes, Captain
You have your orders?
Yes, and a letter for you
to be delivered personally
Thank you
You can guess what
this is, can't you?
A transfer
Yes, exactly
Our Stransky is to report to
Paris within a week
Captain Pukher, my orderly will
arrange for your billeting
But don't unpack everything
We might be going away
Captain
Stransky, without Steiner
to contradict him
he will get his Iron Cross
and stroll all around Paris
Arrogant and bloody bastard
Stransky in Paris and Steiner
God knows where he' II be
Jesus! What, 22, 23 kilometers
between here and Annaville
Marshland, wilderness
If the same trap's behind
the Russian lines
they get you, get you
Here take their gun
Let's try the road
We' II never get over
this, this road
Don't you worry, kid
We' II get out of this
in time for the next one
Steiner! Steiner!
It's clear now
Come, move it, move it!
Anselm, move your ass!
The cattle cars or whatever
they're sending are due to
arrive at 12OO hours
provided of course the Russians
have not blown up the track
Any questions?
No, sir
Dismissed
Carry on probing and aggressive
action all along the front
They're not listening
You, too
I beg your pardon?
Who needs railroad track?
When we break out of here
we' II push on to Pitzkrieg
Stalingrad and up to the
outskirts of Moscow
What will we do when
we lose the war?
Prepare for the next one
Do you think he' II
get through?
Steiner? I don't see
how he can
Anselm, stay solid
What is it?
Bridge
Just bring what you
need to kill with
It's a game
Game?
It's a kid's game
it's bad luck to
step on sunlight
I thought perhaps if
I miss the beams
we would all come
through this alright
Come on
Come on, come on
Over there, get in the corner
Jesus Christ!
Get these weapons out of here!
Kruger, upstairs!
Schnurrbart, perimeter
Check the railings!
Come here, in the corner
In the corner!
Come on, you hear me?
Don't hide from me
Check the radio
Get the party out
of here Anselm!
Stay there!
Keep your hands off
Anselm, stop it, damnit!
Leave me, Steiner
Stop, damnit!
Stop your fucking silly game!
This isn't a brothel!
This is a war!
Rolf, look what I found
Everything clear out here
What is this?
It shows their basic positions
in front of the land
Good, we' II have way home
Thank the ladies and tell them
to take their clothes off
And what shall we do with
the bodies?
Who's gonna keep them warm?
Tell them we want their
tunics and trousers
We're going to do it anyway
Do it!
Let me eat one
Major, major!
She's dead
Dietz, Zoll! Watch them
Yeah
The rest of you, put these
uniforms on
Come on, go over there
with the rest of them
Pick up your weapons
Up, up, out!
Get that uniform and
take it inside
Hey, go away!
Come on, pick it up!
You want to play? Alright
That's my little girl
That's good, come on!
I' II give you
something to play with
I'm gonna be busy
for a while
Come on
How would you like to-
That' nice
Steiner!
Oh, Dietz
God!
The girl...
Do you believe in God, Sergeant?
I believe God is a sadist
but probably doesn't
even know it
Zoll!
Stupid man!
Steiner! God!
Get the women outside
We're leaving
Come on, go!
All of you get inside
Inside!
Now we're even
And there's one other thing
you could do for me
There's a man here I would
like to get out quickly
I spoke to you
about him before
If there is a chance he could
leave with your headquarter staff
I' II be most grateful
Thank you, sir
There really is
nothing but Chaos
That will no longer concern you
You're to report at once to
general headquarters
You're being evacuated
I can't leave the command, sir
Well, I'm still in
a condition to issue orders
Those orders will be obeyed
I'm prepared to disobey
that order, sir
You've been around
to stand it too long
Come, listen to me
for a moment
For many of us Germans
the exterminator is
long overdue and I have
decided that you, I will save
But I'm part of all this
There are better people than me
Most of them are
being killed out there
There's nothing wrong with you
except you snore too much
You're a brave man
braver than you think you are
One of these days there will
be a need for brave civilians
Have you thought of that?
In the new Germany if such
a thing is allowed to exist
there will be a need for
builders, for thinkers-
Of course we can't see now
what your job is to be
I' II make this my final
order to you
You' II search out
and contact all of these
better people you call them?
And together you' II take on
the responsibilities of those
of the survivors
Now you must leave
Please leave
Fone, take Captain
Kiesle to the railroad
Go!
Steiner, how do we get
through the Russian trenches?
Basically a matter of time
They' II be building them
for a thousand years
If not here, somewhere else
In Germany
Germany
Do you think they' II ever
forgive us for what we've done?
Or forget us?
We' II make it, we' II
make it with your help
To tell you the truth
I'm beginning to enjoy it
What do you want?
Digging some
mudholes some place
waiting for the top of your
head to be blown off?
At least here we're free
Steiner, Steiner
Sing it!
Go! Go!
Here, Sergeant
Here's your weapon
All we have to do is to hope
the Russians don't get us
Or the landmines
Somebody ought to
lead us to go
Anselm
Yes
Try to read somebody
with the radio
Tell them we're
coming in at dawn
With a password
What's password... uh...
Reconnaissance patrol with
several Russian prisoners
and no shooting
Password, Kruger
Goddamnit!
Demarcation
Why not? Demarcation
Demarcation
Sign it Steiner
Captain, special password
Demarcation, signed Steiner
He's coming in with prisoners?
Looks like a trap
My thought exactly, sir
They have been captured
Roth!
Sir?
Did you recognized the voice?
No, sir, it was in code
Good code, demarcation
Triebig, if in the dark
you saw a half dozen men
some with the Russian
uniforms advancing on you
could anyone blame you
if you opened fire?
No
Will you check
the situation for me
and take care of it?
You do like Biarritz, don't you?
You do like the south of
France, don't you?
Come on
Oh, shit!
Kern
Yeah
You and I share the weapon
The rest of you make sure
you have it clearly placed
behind your heads
I' II go first
No, goddamnit, Schnurrbart
It might be some asshole
who didn't know
what the message is
No, I go
Rolf!
You've been responsible
for all of us
This time I'm
responsible for you
Take us in
Sir, look here
Welcome, Sergeant Steiner
My passage home
We're Germans!
Steiner! We're coming in!
Demarcation! Demarcation!
Steiner's coming in!
Demarcation!
Demarcation!
Russians coming
Schnurrbart! Move!
Stand by, fire!
Go, go!
Fire!
Demarcation!
Steiner!
Don't stop, fire!
Demarc...
No!
Goddamnit!
Sergeant, they don't
look like prisoners!
Stop it!
Captain, they have
German soldiers with them!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Fucking idiots!
We're German soldiers!
Fire!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Keep firing!
Fire!
Oh, my God!
It's Steiner!
You, stop!
Go get my men, go!
Bloody lousy swines!
Swines!
It's all Stransky's orders!
I had no part in it
We're sorry
He's dead
I had no part in it!
Private Dietz, sir
You're on your own
I don't find a need of
another officer
another platoon
This is it, I don't care
It doesn't matter any more
Where are you going?
To pay my debts
You are our platoon leader!
This thing isn't over yet
You're the new platoon leader
And Anselm is your platoon
Should make you happy
you old pirate
Steiner! Steiner!
Steiner!
Yes, Colonel Brandt?
Situation is worsening here
You're needed
My orders are here
And they are here, sir
In fact the replacement
is running with the company
You may leave, Stransky
Your Triebig is dead
It doesn't work, Captain
I live, and you're dead
Lieutenant Triebig has not been under
my command for several hours
He has been transferred
Aristocratic heir of
Prussian take shit!
Leaving without your
Iron Cross, Captain?
Just a matter of time
Where's the rest of
your platoon?
I said where's the rest of
your platoon, Sergeant Steiner!
You are, Captain Stransky
You are the rest of
my platoon
You know how to use it?
Yes, of course
Steiner, I accept
I' II show you how a Prussian
officer can fight
And I' II show you where
the Iron Crosses grow
Now!
Come on, man!
Don't stand there!
Stoten!
Ersine, with me!
Captain!
Stransky, goddamnit!
Get off your ass!
How do I reload?
How do I reload? Steiner!
