              DON'T FORGET THIS.
  THAT WAS A PRESENT FOR YOU.
        I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE
        HOLDING ON TO IT.
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH IT?
                  THROW IT AWAY.
     FINE.
         WE WERE AN "IT" COUPLE.
NOT REALLY.
    LIKE WHEN WE'D GO TO PARTIES
    AND THERE WAS DANCING,
              WE'D START DANCING
              AND EVERYONE WOULD
         MAKE A CIRCLE AROUND US
         AND WATCH US DANCE.
  OKAY.
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME
WHAT YOU NEED, SHIRIN?
      I NEED MY GIRLFRIEND BACK.
DUDE, I REALLY THINK
YOU JUST NEED TO MOURN THIS
AND MOVE ON.
          I REALLY WANT TO EAT
          MY FEELINGS RIGHT NOW.
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THAT'S AN AMAZING IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE ORDER
ALL THE FATTY, DISGUSTING FOODS
WE NEVER LET OURSELVES EAT?
                     OKAY.
          HEY, GIRLS.
      HOW YOU DOIN' TODAY?
                          HEY.
FANTASTIC.
AND YOU?
UH, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
             BRENDAN.
BRENDAN.
HEY, I'M CRYSTAL.
         HEY, CRYSTAL.
   WHAT CAN I GET YOU TODAY?
UM, LET ME SEE.
I WOULD LOVE AN...
UNSWEETENED GLASS
OF ICED TEA.
           NO PROBLEM.
THANK YOU.
    AND CAN I JUST HAVE ONE
    OF THOSE COMPLIMENTARY MINTS
        I SAW BY THE ENTRANCE
        AND A GLASS OF ICE WATER
       AND A LITTLE BIT OF LEMON
       IN THERE.
             OKAY.
              THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANKS, BRENDAN.
                    MMM, DELISH.
MMM, CAN'T WAIT.
                I'M DEAD INSIDE.
           CAN YOU TELL
           JUST BY LOOKING AT ME
           THAT I'M DEAD INSIDE?
I REALLY THINK
YOU HAD TO END IT.
I MEAN, SHE WASN'T EVEN
FUCKING YOU TOWARDS THE END.
           MAYBE IT WAS A PHASE.
THANKS, BRENDAN.
HOW ABOUT "GIRAFFE"?
         WHAT ABOUT "SAFE WORD"?
LIKE THE WORD "SAFE WORD"
AS OUR SAFE WORD?
    LET'S CUT OUT THE MIDDLEMAN,
   'CAUSE WHAT HAPPENS
   IF YOU FORGET YOUR SAFE WORD?
OKAY, THEN,
THE SAFE WORD IS "SAFE WORD."
                  GREAT.
                  LET'S DO THIS.
            WHAT'S THE SCENARIO?
I'M YOUR TAX AUDITOR.
                    OKAY.
   MISS?
                      YES?
CAN YOU PLEASE
FILL OUT THIS FORM?
                      ALL RIGHT.
                       MISS?
  YES?
           I'VE BEEN A BAD
           SMALL-BUSINESS OWNER.
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM?
              I DON'T HAVE
              ANY OF MY RECEIPTS
         FROM JUNE UNTIL AUGUST,
            AND I'M GONNA
            HAVE TO BE PUNISHED.
THAT'S ACTUALLY
EASILY REMEDIED.
IF YOU'LL JUST FILL IN
THE LARGER EXPENSES IN SECTION C
AND CROSS-CHECK THEM
WITH SECTION B.
                     MAXINE.
  WHAT?
       YOU ARE KILLING THE SEXY.
I'M JUST--
I'M NOT INTO ROLE PLAY.
           THAT'S-- THAT'S OKAY.
I'M VANILLA.
                 DON'T SAY THAT.
IT TRUE.
I'M NOT KINKY.
                      HEY.
LOOK AT ME.
I LIKE VANILLA.
     I'M NOT REALLY IN THE MOOD.
                   I'M SORRY.
IT'S OKAY.
BANAL SEX
SHOULDN'T START
UNTIL AT LEAST A YEAR
INTO A RELATIONSHIP.
            I MOVED IN TOO SOON.
WHEN ARE YOU GOING
BACK TO WORK?
                    I'M NOT.
    NO!
   THE ONLY REASON THEY HIRED ME
   IN THE FIRST PLACE
           IS 'CAUSE THEY WANTED
         A MIDDLE EASTERN PERSON
         ON STAFF.
                NOW THAT YAVAH'S
                IN EDITORIAL,
         EVERYONE'S GUSHING
         OVER HOW SYRIAN SHE IS.
I'M NOT LETTING YOU FALL
INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT
OF DESPAIR AND UNEMPLOYMENT
ON MY COUCH.
          NOTHING BRINGS ME JOY.
WELL... I THINK THIS GUY
I KNOW IS HIRING.
LET ME TALK TO HIM.
AND ARE YOU GONNA GO LOOK
AT THAT APARTMENT
IN BUSHWICK LATER?
              I CAN'T. I HAVE TO
              GO SEE MY PARENTS.
OH, MY GOD!
CAN I COME?
YOUR DAD IS SO HOT.
I JUST WANT TO,
LIKE, PAINT HIM.
                   UGH, NO.
            THAT IS EXACTLY
            WHY YOU CANNOT COME.
SO, UH...
SO, IN THE AFTERNOON,
I TOOK AN APPENDIX,
AND I REWIRED IT
ON THIS KID
WHO HAD NO CONTROL
OF HIS OWN URINE.
                         STOP.
 WOW.
          NO, NO, NO,
        WE MADE HIM DRY.
     BUT NOW HE HAS TO PEE
    OUT OF HIS BELLY BUTTON.
PLEASE STOP.
THIS IS FASCINATING.
    NOT WHILE WE'RE EATING.
            YEAH, IT CAN WAIT
            UNTIL AFTER, RIGHT?
   OKAY.
DID YOU SEE
ALI'S PICTURE
OF THE SEX-REASSIGNMENT
SURGERY?
         NO, I DIDN'T, 'CAUSE
         I DELETED IT THE MINUTE
       I READ "INTESTINE VAGINA"
       IN THE SUBJECT.
             THEY'RE INTERESTING
             PICTURES.
         YEAH, THEY ARE.
SHOW THEM.
      PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
          I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
                    HE HAD TO GO
                   INTO UROLOGY.
     IT'S BECAUSE HE LOVES
      THE PENISES SO MUCH.
FUNNY, DAD.
          HERE YOU GO.
         CHECK IT OUT.
                            UGH!
OH, MY GOD.
               WHAT?
       TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
 YOU'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING AT IT.
           PLEASE PUT THAT AWAY.
         I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT.
                SHE DOESN'T WANT
                TO SEE IT.
                    PUT IT AWAY.
      OKAY, SUIT YOURSELF.
             LAYLI.
                         YES?
 ALI SAYS THAT YOU JUST STARTED
        YOUR FELLOWSHIP.
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
        PLASTIC SURGERY.
                     MM-HMM.
    ISN'T IT WEIRD, THOUGH?
       LIKE, HE'S DEALING
 WITH LIFE-AND-DEATH SITUATIONS
           EVERY DAY,
      AND THEN YOU'RE WITH
  THESE MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIVES
     WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM.
LAYLI IS A PEDIATRIC
RECONSTRUCTIVE
PLASTIC SURGEON.
                I ACTUALLY--
                UH, I SPECIALIZE
              IN BURN TREATMENT
              AND SKIN GRAFTING.
                         COOL.
        I HEARD YOU ARE WORKING
        AT "THE BROOKLYN PAPER."
                      YEAH.
                UM, I'M ACTUALLY
                THINKING
             ABOUT TRANSITIONING
             INTO ANOTHER FIELD.
SO, LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT.
YOU GOT A MASTERS
IN JOURNALISM,
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA DO
JACK SHIT WITH IT?
SHE CAN STILL USE
HER DEGREE.
SHE'S SO TALENTED.
           THANK YOU.
SHE WAS THE ONLY FRESHMAN
IN HIGH SCHOOL
WHO COULD SWIM
ON THE VARSITY TEAM.
AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN
TAKE LESSONS.
WOW, THAT'S A REAL
RESUME BUILDER RIGHT THERE.
     YEAH, THIS BODY'S MADE
         FOR SWIMMING.
     LOOK AT THESE SHOULDERS.
                  THAT'S ENOUGH.
                      THANK YOU.
AND LOOK AT THOSE HANDS.
                    PLEASE STOP.
AREN'T THEY STUNNING?
        THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL HANDS.
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD GET
INTO HAND MODELING.
                          AH.
BUT I JUST DON'T KNOW
HOW PEOPLE GET STARTED.
              IT'S WHO YOU KNOW.
A MASTERS IN JOURNALISM,
THAT'S HOW YOU GET STARTED.
       I WOULD LITERALLY LIKE TO
       TALK ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE.
OKAY, HOW'S YOUR LOVE LIFE?
       ANY BOYS WE SHOULD
          KNOW ABOUT?
                 NO.
                 NO BOYS AT ALL.
 OH, THANK GOD I DON'T HAVE TO
   GET MY SHOTGUN READY THEN.
GOOD ONE, DAD.
OH, GOD.
KEN?
HEY.
                    GINNY.
  SHIRIN.
                      SHIRIN.
          WHAT IS THAT? LIBYAN?
          ARMENIAN? ARGENTINEAN?
  IRANIAN.
                   OH, IRANIAN.
                     WOW. IRAN.
        WHAT DO YOU THINK
        OF THAT WHOLE SITUATION?
IT'S A MIXED BAG.
A LOT OF VERY
GOOD-INTENTIONED PEOPLE
DEALING WITH SOME
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.
              YOU GET OVER THERE
              VERY OFTEN?
YEAH.
ACTUALLY, I GO IN THE SUMMERS
TO VISIT FAMILY.
                        WOW.
               OKAY, SO TELL ME,
          WHAT IS THE SCENE LIKE
          IN TEHRAN?
                I JUST READ
                THIS BIG ARTICLE
        ABOUT THE UNDERGROUND
        HIP-HOP SCENE IN "VICE."
   YEAH.
        SO, YOU'RE PART OF THAT?
NO. UNFORTUNATELY, I SPEND
MOST OF MY TIME IN IRAN
WATCHING DISNEY VIDEOS
WITH MY GRANDMOTHER
WHILE SHE
UNTANGLES JEWELRY.
YEAH, I GOT MYSELF
SOME COFFEE.
DO YOU WANT SOMETHING
TO DRINK?
                   NO, THANKS.
            I AM BUZZED ON SKUNK
            RIGHT NOW.
  NICE.
            SO, CRYSTAL TELLS ME
            YOU ARE AN ARTIST.
   YES.
YEAH, I AM.
          YOU'RE A VIDEO ARTIST.
  MM-HMM.
                       GREAT.
      SO, I DON'T KNOW
      WHAT CRYSTAL HAS TOLD YOU,
     BUT I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
     RELIABLE TO TAKE OVER
               AN AFTERSCHOOL
               FILMMAKING CLASS.
      IT'S WITH A BUNCH OF KIDS,
      AND THEY'RE REALLY GREAT
         AND SO SMART
         AND, UH, JUST CREATIVE.
              AND REALLY,
              ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
           IS JUST SHOW THEM
           HOW TO HOLD A CAMERA.
I CAN DO THAT, YEAH.
             SO, WHAT IS
             YOUR SCHEDULE LIKE?
COMPLETELY OPEN.
                       PERFECT.
        ALL RIGHT, WELL,
        MAY I SAY LET'S DO THIS?
   OKAY.
                     GREAT.
             DON'T FUCK ME OVER.
   OKAY.
              YOU TOLD HIM
              I WAS A FILMMAKER?
YOU SAID
YOU NEEDED A JOB.
               HOW DO YOU KNOW
               THIS GUY ANYWAY?
HE'S THAT INVESTMENT BANKER
IN MY PARENTS' BUILDING
I USED TO HOOK UP WITH
IN HIGH SCHOOL.
                  OH, MY GOD.
                  HE'S THAT GUY.
MM-HMM.
YEAH, SO HE LOST HIS JOB,
BECAME A STAY-AT-HOME DAD,
AND GOT INTO LIGHT DRUGS.
                   GOOD FOR HIM.
SO, DO YOU HAVE
A LESSON PLAN?
          WHAT IS THIS, GERMANY?
       THEY'RE PARK SLOPE TEENS.
      I COULD LOCK 'EM IN A ROOM
         WITH A HALF-EATEN APPLE
         AND A TIC TAC
             AND COME BACK
             TO THE "MONA LISA."
WH-- WHY ARE WE STOPPING?
         OH, I HAVE TO TAKE CARE
         OF SOMETHING.
              YOU WAIT OUT HERE.
NO, NO, NO, WAIT.
OH, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
YOU SAID THAT NO AMOUNT
OF WHOLESALE SPELT SUSHI
WAS WORTH THE EMOTIONAL TOLL
OF BEING HERE.
        SHE'S HERE ALL THE TIME.
THEY DON'T EVEN OFFER
PAPER BAGS.
IT'S SURPRISING HOW,
UH, LONELY IT GETS
WHEN YOU'RE SINGLE AGAIN,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU LIVE
WITH SOMEONE.
YOU GET SO USED
TO THEIR HABITS
AND THEIR LIFESTYLE
AND THEIR SMELLS,
BUT, UM, I REALLY
JOINED THE CO-OP
TO SPEND TIME WITH HER,
'CAUSE, LET'S BE HONEST,
IT'S NOT THE MOST PLEASANT
PLACE TO WORK IN THE WORLD.
BUT IF I REALLY WANT MAXINE
BACK IN MY LIFE,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES,
AND THAT MEANS GETTING BACK
ONTO HER CO-OP SHIFT,
AND THAT'S
WHERE YOU COME IN.
       IT-- IT SAYS IN YOUR FILE
         THAT YOU HAVEN'T WORKED
         A SHIFT IN FOUR MONTHS.
EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES.
I'VE HAD A VERY
BROKEN HEART.
               LOOK, ALL MEMBERS
               ARE ENTITLED
            TO ONE FREE PASS
            AFTER A DELINQUENCY,
            BUT I CANNOT GET YOU
            ONTO HER SHIFT.
                IT'S ALL BOOKED.
I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR NAME.
                     JACKIE.
HI, JACKIE.
UM...
THE LAST TIME I CHECKED,
THIS IS A COOPERATIVE.
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND COOPERATE WITH ME,
AND I'LL COOPERATE
WITH YOU.
    BUT HOW DO YOU GET THEM
           SO CURLY?
LET'S GO.
         IT WAS SO NICE
          MEETING YOU.
SHIRIN TOLD ME
YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
LANDSCAPING
OR PORTRAITS?
I SPECIALIZE IN
EXPERIMENTAL INSTALLATIONS,
AND JACQUES IS CURRENTLY
FOCUSING ON SANDCASTLE WORK
INTEGRATING
FOUND OBJECTS.
WE'RE DONE WITH THE BOXES.
          I'M COMING.
         IT WAS SO NICE
          MEETING YOU.
THERE'S NO TOILET PAPER.
HEY, YOU GUYS CAN GO.
I FEEL LIKE I'M 17
AND YOU'RE MOVING ME
BACK INTO COLLEGE.
       I WISH.
       THAT DORM WAS MUCH NICER.
THIS IS WHAT IT IS
TO FIND A PLACE
ON SHORT NOTICE
IN BROOKLYN.
               AT LEAST YOU HAVE
               A SEXY ROOMMATE.
FELICIA? I FIND HER
A BIT TERRIFYING.
           NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
           THE BOY-- JACQUES.
              YOUR NEW ROOMMATES
              ARE FREAKS.
HEY, IS THIS
HOW YOU SAY HELLO?
                       HI.
CAN WE TELL HER?
         TELL ME WHAT?
                   I'M PROPOSING
                   TO LAYLI.
              WHY?
                         HEY.
 SHIRIN.
         I'M NOT SAYING
      YOU SHOULDN'T DO IT.
          IT'S JUST...
        HE'S VERY YOUNG.
            HE'S 33.
     I WAS ONLY 19
     WHEN I MARRIED YOUR FATHER.
  WELL, THIS ISN'T THE ISLAMIC
     REPUBLIC OF IRAN, MOM.
       DO YOU SEE A HIJAB
          ON MY HEAD?
         WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
           NOTHING.
      YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A BRAT.
      STOP IT.
        YOU'RE BRINGING
    A LOT OF NEGATIVE ENERGY
       INTO MY NEW HOME.
OH, THIS IS NOT A HOME.
         THIS IS A REFUGEE CAMP.
        SERIOUSLY,
        WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
   YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A COOL
   BROOKLYN LOFT LOOKS LIKE.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU LEFT
YOUR OLD APARTMENT.
        THE NEIGHBORHOOD
      WAS SO MUCH BETTER.
     IT GOT TOO EXPENSIVE.
       WE WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU.
THIS IS MY NEW HOME,
AND I LOVE IT.
             OKAY.
           ALI, COME.
    HELP ME IN THE KITCHEN.
              OKAY, BUT I'M NOT
              TOUCHING ANYTHING.
        I'M SURE THE GIRL
        WHO LET ME IN HAS HEP C.
    DAD?
               YEAH?
     I'M WORRIED ABOUT ALI.
      I THINK HE'S JUMPING
         INTO MARRIAGE
       BECAUSE HE THINKS
           HE HAS TO.
        HE'S GOT CLASSIC
     OLDER CHILD SYNDROME.
       HE'LL DO ANYTHING
   TO MAKE YOU AND MOM HAPPY.
SHE HAS NO GOALS
OR ASPIRATIONS.
SHE TAKES NOTHING
SERIOUSLY.
SHE'S BECOMING A LOSER.
               LOWER YOUR VOICE.
SHE HAS THIS, LIKE,
YOUNGER CHILD THING.
I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU NEED TO BE ON TOP OF THAT.
              YOU DON'T THINK
              I'M DOING MY BEST?
                 SHE'S NOT EASY.
HE'S, LIKE,
BURYING HIS EMOTIONS
DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE,
AND, LIKE, ONE DAY,
HE COULD PULL A GUN
ON HIS COWORKERS.
I THINK SHE HAS
SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES.
       YEAH, NO KIDDING.
     WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
      SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND?
THAT VIRGINIA TECH KID
WAS JUST TRYING TO PLEASE
HIS STRICT KOREAN PARENTS.
IT'S NOT LIKE SHE'S DUMB
OR SUPER UNATTRACTIVE.
I MEAN, SHE'S PERFECTLY
CAPABLE OF BEING NORMAL.
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO FIND HIMSELF,
LIKE, TEN YEARS FROM NOW,
FAT, BALD,
AND IN A LOVELESS MARRIAGE
BECAUSE HE WAS
RUSHING TO BECOME
THE WORLD'S BEST
IRANIAN SON.
           THE MEN IN OUR FAMILY
           DON'T GO BALD.
OH, I DON'T NEED
NEW READING MATERIAL.
I'M ONLY UP TO BOOK TWO
OF THE "TWILIGHT" SERIES.
                  I'M BROADENING
                  YOUR HORIZONS.
THIS IS SOME
PRETTY SERIOUS STUFF HERE.
          I'M ASKING YOU TO READ
          SOME BOOKS.
           YOU DON'T NEED TO GET
           YOUR SEPTUM PIERCED.
                      YET.
OH, HEY.
UM, EXCUSE ME,
THIS IS ACTUALLY
THE BROOKLYN KIDS
MOVIE MAKER CLASS.
I THINK YOU HAVE
THE WRONG ROOM.
                 NO, THIS RIGHT.
         I'M A MOVIE DIRECTOR.
        SEE YOU AT FIVE.
             AND I'M GONNA POOP.
NO! DON'T!
KUJO, COULD YOU
PLEASE HOLD--
PUT DOWN THE TRUCK
AND HOLD THE CAMERA.
STOP THROWING.
         I DON'T THINK
      YOU CAN FIT IT ALL.
HEY, KUJO, THE LENS IS
WAY TOO CLOSE TO YOUR BUTT.
          OH, YOU'RE ON OkCupid.
       MY TAXIDERMIST MET
       HER HUSBAND ON THAT SITE.
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
TO MAKE MY GIRLFRIEND JEALOUS.
WE'RE ON A BREAK.
                    GOOD LUCK.
    FELICIA?
                       YES?
YOU'RE IN A LONG-TERM,
SEEMINGLY HEALTHY
RELATIONSHIP.
CAN YOU TELL ME,
HOW DO PEOPLE MEET,
AGREE THEY LIKE
EACH OTHER,
AND THEN... KEEP ON
LIKING EACH OTHER?
               SHARED INTERESTS?
              JACQUES AND I MET
              AT OCCUPY CHELSEA.
I'M GONNA LIE HERE
AND TRY TO FORGET
WHAT IT FELT LIKE
TO BE LOVED.
COULD YOU PLEASE
TURN OFF THE LIGHT?
                  FEEL BETTER.
THANK YOU.
                     HEY.
    HI.
           YOU WANT A CIGARETTE?
I DON'T SMOKE.
               YEAH, ME NEITHER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT HERE?
SOCIAL ANXIETY.
                 WHAT ABOUT YOU?
MORE OR LESS THE SAME.
                    I'M SHIRIN.
  MAXINE.
          IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.
                   I LOVE DYKES.
  NICE.
                     I MEAN IT.
YOU KNOW THAT-- THAT WORD
IS INCREDIBLY OFFENSIVE.
       OH, I'M BISEXUAL,
       SO IT'S OKAY IF I SAY IT.
NO, IT'S STILL OFFENSIVE.
        YOU KNOW HOW I MEANT IT.
DOESN'T MATTER
HOW YOU MEANT IT.
              TOMATO, TO-MAH-TO.
WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
      I FILLED THIS WATER BOTTLE
      WITH TEQUILA.
CLASSY.
                 I'M DRINKING
                 WITH A PURPOSE.
  YEAH?
THIS GUY
            WITH WHOM I RECENTLY
     HAD AN UNFORTUNATE SEXUAL
     ENCOUNTER SHOWED UP,
               AND NOW I FEEL
               UNCOMFORTABLE.
               I JUST HATE
               THE WAY DUDES GET
        WHEN THEY CAN'T MAINTAIN
        AN ERECTION.
WHAT DO THEY GET LIKE?
        OH, ARE YOU A GOLD STAR?
NO, I'VE HAD SEX WITH MEN,
JUST, UM, NOT THE KIND
WHO GO SOFT.
                   TOUCHÉ.
                 IT'S THE WORST.
                 THEY SHUT DOWN,
          AND THEY GET
          ALL MOPEY AND OFFENDED
            WHEN YOU MAKE JOKES.
YEAH, IT'S SO WEIRD
THE WAY MEN DON'T ENJOY
HUMOR AT THE EXPENSE
OF THEIR PENISES.
               DO YOU WANT SOME?
  SURE.
             I THINK YOU'RE HOT.
THANKS.
        I KNOW THAT I DON'T LOOK
        LIKE I'M INTO GIRLS
     AND THAT I WAS JUST TALKING
     ABOUT BEING A BONER KILLER,
           BUT I AM SUPER SEXY
           AND SUPER INTO GIRLS.
REALLY?
                     YEAH.
          I LIKE GIRLS LIKE YOU.
LIKE ME?
          YOU KNOW, LIKE, MANLY,
           BUT ALSO A LITTLE BIT
           LIKE A LADY.
NICE.
THANK YOU.
UM...
                  ARE YOU HAVING
                  LADY PROBLEMS?
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M HAVING LADY PROBLEMS?
                  BECAUSE IT'S
                  NEW YEAR'S EVE
          AND YOU'RE HEADING OUT
          BEFORE THE COUNTDOWN.
MAYBE I'M HEADING OUT
TO MEET THE PERSON
I'M GONNA KISS AT MIDNIGHT.
                 YOU'RE GONNA BE
                 HELLA LATE
              'CAUSE IT'S LIKE,
              TWO MINUTES AWAY.
                WHAT'S HER NAME?
 LINDA.
         SHE SOUNDS LIKE A CUNT.
WE'RE GOING OUT
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS,
AND WE DECIDED
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.
                      NATURALLY.
AND FOUR DAYS
AFTER I BREAK MY LEASE
AND SELL EVERYTHING I OWN,
SHE TELLS ME
SHE MISSES HER EX,
AND WHAT THE FUCK
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO
WITH THAT INFORMATION?
                     THAT SUCKS.
JUST HAVING TROUBLE DEALING
WITH, LIKE, BROOKLYN PARTIES
AND EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT
THEIR KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGNS,
AND DID YOU SEE THAT GUY
WITH THE WAXED DALI MUSTACHE?
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT GUY'S PROBLEM?
WHO THE FUCK
DOES HE THINK HE IS?
               I FIND YOUR ANGER
               INCREDIBLY SEXY.
REALLY?
             I HATE
             SO MANY THINGS TOO.
                      WOW.
KEN. HI.
                    OH! HEY, HI.
                    HOW ARE YOU?
I'M GOOD, THANK YOU.
                 CARRINGTON,
                 THIS IS SHAYLA.
I'M SHIRIN. HI.
                   OH...
                 SORRY, MAN.
                 I'M STONED.
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
                   WANT A J?
NO, I'M COOL.
THANKS.
LISTEN, UM...
I'M A TERRIBLE TEACHER.
                      NO.
YES, I AM.
UH, THE KIDS HATE ME.
THEY'RE A GOOD
TEN YEARS YOUNGER
THAN I THOUGHT
THEY'D BE,
AND I CAN'T GET THEM
TO LISTEN.
               YOU CAN'T TAKE IT
               PERSONALLY, DUDE.
                  THEY'RE FIVE.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.
    I HAVE THREE KIDS.
    I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
               IT'S JUST FAKE IT
               'TIL YOU MAKE IT.
         I'VE LOST CARRINGTON,
         LIKE, WHAT, FOUR TIMES?
                     RIGHT, BRO?
        JUST DO YOUR BEST, OKAY?
  OKAY.
                      HEY.
         I BELIEVE IN YOU, CHER.
THANK YOU.
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
YOU'RE BISEXUAL?
I'M SORRY, WHAT COUNTRY IS IT
   THAT YOU GET STONED TO DEATH
             IF YOU'RE CONVICTED
             OF BEING GAY?
                 OH, YEAH.
                 WAIT, I KNOW.
                   IT'S IRAN,
       THE COUNTRY THAT MY
       ENTIRE FAMILY COMES FROM.
YOU CAN'T KEEP PLAYING
THE PERSIAN CARD
EVERY TIME
WE HAVE AN ARGUMENT.
                 YOU NEED TO SEE
                 FOR YOURSELF
       HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BE
       THE CHILD OF IMMIGRANTS.
I WOULD LOVE TO.
                      GREAT.
     THEN YOU'RE COMING
     TO A PERSIAN NEW YEAR PARTY
     THIS WEEKEND IN NEW JERSEY.
AM I COMING AS YOUR DATE?
                   GOD, NO.
        YOU'RE DEFINITELY COMING
        AS MY WHITE FRIEND.
            DO YOU THINK
            I HAVE A DEATH WISH?
           YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
           HAVE TO WEAR A DRESS.
  NO.
                GOOD. NOW YOU'RE
                GONNA SEND 'EM?
    YES.
IT'S LIKE WE JUST STEPPED
      INTO LIBERACE'S WET DREAM.
ISN'T IT SPECTACULAR?
        YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE
        BEING IN ENCLOSED SPACES
         WHERE I CAN'T DETECT
         ANY VISIBLY GAY PEOPLE.
WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE
UNCLE NEEMA'S HARBORING
SOME BI-CURIOUS
TENDENCIES.
                 YOU TALK TO HIM
                 ABOUT IT?
OH, GOD, NO.
PERSIANS COMMUNICATE
MOSTLY THROUGH GOSSIP.
SHIRIN?
OH, MY GOD! HI!
              HI!
                        HI!
MAXINE, THIS IS MITRA,
YASSI, MEENU, AND YASSI.
GUYS, THIS IS
MY FRIEND MAXINE.
                      HEY.
        HEY. OH, MY GOD,
       YOU LOOK AMAZING.
RIGHT. NEXT TO YOU, I LOOK
LIKE A BUSBOY FROM CHILI'S.
          OH, NO WAY.
  YOU'RE PRACTICALLY A MODEL.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
LIKE A "BEFORE" MODEL
FOR ACCUTANE.
        UH, I WOULD KILL
        FOR YOUR HEIGHT.
AND I WOULD SELL MY FIRSTBORN
FOR YOUR SKIN.
            STOP IT.
YOU STOP IT.
           WE NEED TO
       GET TOGETHER MORE.
    I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE
  YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S FUNERAL.
       HOW'S YOUR FATHER?
YOU KNOW, HE'S OKAY,
BUT THEN SOMETIMES
HE'LL CRY OUT OF NOWHERE,
AND I'LL BE LIKE,
"DAD, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?
YOU'RE EMASCULATING
YOURSELF."
OH, MY GOD! ROYA?
             WHAT JUST HAPPENED?
          YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE
          OF A SENTENCE.
YEAH, EVERY TIME
I SEE HER,
SHE COMPLIMENTS
THE WAY I LOOK,
SHE ASKS
ONE PERSONAL QUESTION,
AND THEN SHE WALKS AWAY
WHILE I ANSWER.
                 AND WHO'S SHE
                 TALKING TO NOW?
THAT'S ROYA.
HER FATHER JUST MADE A LOT
OF MONEY IMPORTING SAMOVARS.
              LET'S GET A DRINK.
                 WHEN ARE THEY
                 SERVING DINNER?
MIDNIGHT.
                      SERIOUSLY?
GOD, YOU KNOW,
I SHOULD HAVE TALKED
ABOUT HER DAD'S
COSMETIC DENTAL PRACTICE.
          YOU WERE BEING HONEST.
DO YOU THINK THEY WANT YOU
TO BE HONEST AT THESE THINGS?
           OH, GET A GRIP.
           YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN.
         YOU'VE BEEN TO HOW MANY
         PARTIES IN YOUR LIFE?
I DON'T KNOW.
A LOT.
   AND WHAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT
             PART
                OF HAVING A GOOD
                TIME AT A PARTY?
DRINKING.
                        AND?
DANCING.
        AND WHO'S VERY GOOD
        AT BOTH OF THOSE THINGS?
I AM.
                   THAT'S RIGHT.
TWO VODKA TONICS,
PLEASE.
THAT WAS AMAZING.
I'VE NEVER HAD SO MUCH FUN
AROUND PERSIANS BEFORE.
        I'M SORRY, I KNOW YOU'RE
        HAVING A BREAKTHROUGH,
       BUT CAN YOU FIRST EXPLAIN
       TO ME THIS FIRE THING?
YEAH.
SO, THE WEDNESDAY
BEFORE NORUZ,
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO
JUMP OVER FIRE
TO EXORCISE YOURSELF
OF EVIL SPIRITS
AND START THE NEW YEAR
FRESH.
ONLY WE'RE DOING IT NOW
'CAUSE EVERYONE HAD WORK
AND WE'RE
HALF-ASSED IRANIANS.
            GOD, IT'S SUCH
            A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE.
UGH, YOU ARE
TOTALLY HAVING
ONE OF THOSE "I'M DATING
AN IMMIGRANT" MOMENTS.
LIKE, "ISN'T LEARNING
ABOUT OTHER CULTURES
SO FUN AND ENRICHING?
I FEEL LIKE I'M--"
          HI.
HI.
SO, THIS IS
WHERE YOU'VE BEEN?
    YEAH.
WE JUST CAME OUT HERE.
WHERE WERE YOU?
YOUR FATHER GOT LOST.
        I TOOK THE SCENIC ROUTE.
THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
THIS IS MAXINE,
MY FRIEND.
MAXINE, MEET MY PARENTS.
                      HI.
HI, MAXINE. OH.
                        HI.
SO, HOW DO YOU
LIKE NORUZ?
         I'M SO SORRY.
I THINK I LEFT MY PURSE INSIDE.
        I GOT TO GO RUN
          AND GET IT.
         I WILL SEE YOU
          REALLY SOON.
- NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH.
-                       S
NICE TO MEET YOU.
               NICE TO MEET YOU.
         IT SAYS ON YOUR PROFILE
         THAT YOU'RE AN ARTIST.
YEAH, I DO A
STAND-UP/FOLK MUSIC HYBRID ACT.
              I HAVE NEVER HEARD
              OF THAT.
YEAH, MY ART
DEFIES LABELS.
                 SOUNDS LIKE IT.
WHY DOES COMEDY
ALWAYS HAVE TO
BE SO MEAN AND AT
SOMEBODY'S EXPENSE?
I WANT TO USE MY COMEDY
TO BRING ATTENTION
TO SOCIAL-JUSTICE ISSUES.
             YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.
THANK YOU.
       WHY DON'T YOU GET TO WORK
       ON THAT DRINK?
               CAN I GET A GLASS
               OF WATER?
COME HERE.
CLOSER.
YOU HAVE
REALLY NICE HAIR.
                    THANKS.
YOU CAN BE ROUGH WITH ME.
TELL ME WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO.
                 LIE ON THE BED.
  OKAY.
FUCK!
COULD YOU PUT THESE ON?
  WHAT? YOU'RE-- YOU'RE THE ONE
  WHO WANTED WEED.
WELL, I REEK OF SEX.
IT'S GONNA TRIGGER
THE DRUG DEALER'S BRAIN
TO CALL IN
HIS RAPIST BRAIN.
                   YOU'RE LUCKY
                   I VEER MACHO.
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE AMAZING.
LADIES FIRST.
     I'M NOT SO GOOD AT
     SMOKING WEED AROUND PEOPLE.
    CAN'T HOLD MY THOUGHTS STILL
    LONG ENOUGH TO THINK THEM.
           I HAVE TO CHASE THEM.
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
THE OTHER DAY,
I HAD A REALLY GOOD IDEA
FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK
WHILE I WAS SMOKING WEED,
AND NOW I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT IT WAS.
             KEEP SMOKING.
             YOU'LL GET IT BACK.
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THAT EPISODE
OF "SEX AND THE CITY"
WHERE CARRIE HAS TO PITCH
A BOOK FOR CHILDREN
AND SHE PITCHES
THIS IDEA
ABOUT A LITTLE GIRL
WITH MAGIC CIGARETTES?
AND IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
             I HATE
             "SEX AND THE CITY."
YEAH, BUT YOU
HAVE TO ADMIT
IT'S PRETTY FUCKING
ENTERTAINING.
            I THINK IT'S BORING.
WHO THE FUCK
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU
INTO "LORD OF THE RINGS"?
          YOU KNOW,
          THE OLDER MY DAD GETS,
   THE MORE HE LOOKS LIKE GOLLUM
   FROM "LORD OF THE RINGS."
MY DAD, HE'S ALWAYS
MAKING THE WORST JOKES,
BUT THEN THIS ONE TIME
HE LOST HIS WEDDING RING,
AND HE WAS LIKE...
"I NEED MY PRECIOUS."
AND WAS LITERALLY THE FUNNIEST
THING I'D EVER HEARD.
            WHEN I WENT TO SEE
            THE FILM "PRECIOUS,"
THERE WAS A MENTALLY HANDICAPPED
GUY SITTING NEXT TO ME,
   AND HE PUT HIS HAND ON MY LAP
   DURING THE MOVIE,
               AND IT REALLY
               FREAKED ME OUT.
THAT'S HORRIBLE.
           DON'T MAKE FUN OF ME.
           THIS IS SERIOUS.
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S VERY SERIOUS,
AND I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT LIFETIME HAS NOT MADE
THE MOVIE VERSION
OF THE TIME SOME DUDE
FELT YOU UP AT THE MOVIES.
             YOU'RE SUCH A JERK.
YOU LOVE IT.
                    SHIRIN.
   YEAH?
             WE'RE THE SAME KIND
             OF STONED PERSON.
THAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL.
NO HOMO.
               WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
               "NO HOMO"?
OH, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT "NO HOMO" IS?
OKAY, SO "NO HOMO"
IS THIS THING
THAT RAPPERS SAY
TO EACH OTHER
TO, LIKE, NULLIFY
THE GAYNESS OF THEIR WORDS.
             THEY COULD BE LIKE,
      "THOSE ARE SOME REALLY FLY
      JEANS, MAN. NO HOMO."
       OR "YOUR SONG TOUCHED ME.
       NO HOMO."
LIKE "I LIKE THE WAY
YOUR DICK TASTES IN MY MOUTH.
NO HOMO."
                        EXACTLY.
             I FEEL REALLY LUCKY
             TO HAVE MET YOU.
NO HOMO?
                       HOMO.
            I LOVE HOW NONE
            OF YOUR WHITE SHIRTS
             GET THOSE REALLY
             ANNOYING PIT STAINS
            THAT MINE ALWAYS DO.
I LOVE THAT YOU
NOTICED THAT.
I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY MIND,
BUT IT FEELS TOO SCARY
TO SAY OUT LOUD.
                    SAY IT.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ON YOUR MIND?
                      MAYBE.
  WHAT?
               DON'T BE A PUSSY.
OKAY, LET'S SAY IT
AT THE SAME TIME
ON THE COUNT
OF THREE.
  ONE...
                      TWO...
  TWO...
             I'M FALLING IN LOVE
             WITH YOU.
I'M THINKING OF
TRANSITIONING INTO A MAN.
OF COURSE I'M FALLING
IN LOVE WITH YOU.
         HI, EVERYONE.
  I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU ALL
  TO "WITH JUSTICE FOR SOME,"
        WHERE WE LOOK AT
  THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
            AND ITS BIAS AGAINST
            THE QUEER COMMUNITY.
   NOW IF ANY OF YOU ARE HERE
   FOR THE DYKE KNITTING CIRCLE,
     IT'S BEEN MOVED TO BABELAND
     ON RIVINGTON.
         UM, WE HAVE SOME COPIES
         OF THE CASE STUDY
              TO GO AROUND,
              SO PLEASE TAKE ONE
               IF YOU DON'T HAVE
               IT ALREADY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
                        OH, HEY.
     YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
     WHO CARES ABOUT GAY RIGHTS.
THIS IS MY EVENT.
I MARKED IT ON THE CALENDAR.
           HEY, GUYS,
    LET'S HOLD THE SIDE TALK
  UNTIL AFTER THE DISCUSSION.
SORRY.
WHY DON'T WE START BY
    INTRODUCING OURSELVES, HMM?
         I AM SASHA, AND I AM
         A LAW PROFESSOR AT NYU.
HI, I'M MORGAN.
I'M AN INTERN AT QUEER AID.
MAXINE.
WHAT?
              IS THAT SHIRT NEW?
YES.
                 IT LOOKS REALLY
                 GOOD ON YOU.
     I'M JOSEPH HENDERSON,
       AND I'M EXTREMELY
 DISAPPOINTED WITH THE READING
   MATERIAL YOU'VE PROVIDED.
ABSOLUTELY NO REFERENCE
 TO CRIME AGAINST NATURE LAWS.
IT'S WEIRD SEEING YOU IN
     SOMETHING I DON'T REMEMBER.
TRUE, UM, THIS READING
          DOESN'T REFER TO--
      I WAS ARRESTED AT 18
   FOR HAVING CONSENSUAL SEX
 WITH MY 16-YEAR-OLD BOYFRIEND.
              I SPENT FOUR YEARS
              IN JAIL,
     AND AFTERWARDS FORCED TO
     REGISTER IS A SEX OFFENDER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING LATER?
GOING HOME.
              REMEMBER WHEN THAT
              WAS MY HOME, TOO?
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.
I'M A SEX OFFENDER.
EVERY TOWN I MOVE TO,
EVERY JOB I APPLY FOR--
MY LIFE IS RUINED.
                  HAVE A DRINK
                  WITH ME LATER?
NO.
            I JUST WANT TO TALK.
NO!
...AND I THOUGHT
      WE WERE GOING TO BE
   TALKING ABOUT MARGINALIZED
       WOMEN HERE TODAY.
              YES.
              MY NAME IS SHIRIN.
               I AM AN IRANIAN
               BISEXUAL TEACHER,
        AND I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE
        YOU OUT FOR A DRINK.
            N-- NOW?
               RIGHT AFTER THIS.
             I WOULD LIKE
             TO BUY YOU A DRINK.
             UM...
        EACH FRAME IS A PICTURE.
               THAT'S WHAT YOU
               CALL IT, A FRAME.
         AND, UH, WHEN YOU WANT
         TO HAVE THE CANDY MOVE,
     YOU'RE GONNA TAKE A PICTURE
     OF IT WHERE IT IS,
                  MOVE IT VERY,
                  VERY SLIGHTLY,
                 AND THEN TO
                 THE NEXT PLACE,
     AND THEN YOU TAKE A PICTURE
     AND YOU HAVE IT THERE,
                AND THEN MOVE IT
                A LITTLE BIT--
          HE TOOK IT!
               DO NOT EAT THOSE.
         THOSE ARE FOR
   THE STOP-MOTION ANIMATION.
                       JUST ONE.
    YOU JUST SHOVED LIKE 40
    INTO YOUR MOUTH AT ONCE.
  I GET 40, TOO.
ME, TOO!
 I NEED TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
            ME, TOO!
    ARE YOU OLD ENOUGH TO GO
          ON YOUR OWN?
         I DON'T KNOW.
     ALL RIGHT, WAIT HERE.
     ALL RIGHT, FIRST SHOT
          OF THE DAY.
  WE HAVE THE FLOCKS OF BIRDS
       SWARM INTO FRAME,
 EVIL-LOOKING RAVENS AND GULLS.
      HOW'S THAT LOOKING,
        ART DEPARTMENT?
EXCELLENT.
           AND SOUND?
       IS EVERYTHING SET?
              HI.
      SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
                  NOT A PROBLEM.
           WE WERE JUST PREPPING
           FOR TODAY'S SHOOT.
  GRACIE, WOULD YOU MIND, UH,
       BRIEFING OUR GUEST
      ON TODAY'S PROJECT?
          WE'RE DOING
          A SHOT-FOR-SHOT REMAKE
                 OF A SCENE FROM
                 "THE BIRDS."
          I'M SHIRIN.
    I TEACH ACROSS THE HALL.
         HI, I'M TIBET.
  THIS IS THE ADVANCED CLASS.
             I HAVE A REAL QUICK
             QUESTION FOR YOU.
              YES?
               SO, YEAH, MY KIDS
               ARE REAL YOUNG,
           LIKE FIVE YEARS OLD,
           AND ONE OF THEM NEEDS
            TO USE THE BATHROOM.
              YES?
     WELL, DO I HAVE TO GO IN
     WITH HIM, OR IS THAT PERVY?
        ARE YOU SERIOUS?
                            YES.
   JUST STAND BEHIND THE DOOR
   AND ASK IF HE NEEDS HELP.
                             OH.
OKAY, THANKS.
         NOT A PROBLEM,
           MY FRIEND.
             HAVE WE MET BEFORE?
       I DON'T THINK SO.
   I USED TO BE A HAIR MODEL,
   SO YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE ME
           FROM THAT.
       YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY IT.
THANK YOU.
     ALL RIGHT, SECOND SHOT
          OF THE DAY.
        WE HAVE, "SHE IS TRAPPED
        IN THE PHONE BOOTH
       AND THE BIRDS ARE
       FLYING IN TO ATTACK HER."
       HAIR AND MAKEUP FOR THAT,
       HOW ARE YOU DOING?
    THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING
    ALL THE WAY OUT TO BROOKLYN.
  IT IS SO NICE THAT YOU FINALLY
  GOT TO SEE THE PLACE.
WELL, THE RUG LOOKS
QUITE NICE IN HERE.
                      THANK YOU.
   WHY IS THERE ONLY ONE BED?
                   IT'S EUROPEAN
                   AND THRIFTY.
                   THERE'S A LOT
                   OF BENEFITS.
           AND HOW--
      HOW'S THAT EUROPEAN?
        I HAVE AN ITALIAN FRIEND
        NAMED CECILIA,
                AND SHE HER
                BEST FRIEND, UH,
                  SHARED ONE BED
                  FOR YEARS,
           AND THEY SAVED
           SO MUCH MONEY ON RENT
                  THAT THEY WERE
                  ABLE TO AFFORD
            VERY BIG WEDDINGS
            TO THEIR BOYFRIENDS.
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
MAXINE?
NO, I DON'T.
            ALSO, IN
            THE MOVIE "BEACHES,"
          THESE TWO BEST FRIENDS
          SHARED A BED,
                 AND IT WAS VERY
                 INEXPENSIVE.
             SO, THANK YOU
             SO MUCH FOR COMING.
NICE TO SEE YOU
BOTH AGAIN.
       WELL, BYE, GIRLS.
              BYE.
            LET ME WALK YOU OUT.
OH, MY GOD.
                YOU...
                YOU'RE AN ANGEL.
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM
ABOUT US.
                         I KNOW.
                            YES?
                      HI.
              HEY.
CRYSTAL, DID YOU
SEE MY PARENTS?
             OH, YEAH, WE JUST
             PASSED IN THE HALL.
                    HEY, MAXINE.
   HI.
      MMM, DON'T MIND HER.
       SHE'S UPSET 'CAUSE
   I'M NOT OUT TO MY PARENTS.
     OH, WELL, YOU GUYS LIVE
     IN A ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT.
      I'M PRETTY SURE THEY KNOW.
DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL.
                  YOU KNOW WHAT?
          IT'S A PROCESS,
          AND I'M WORKING ON IT.
OKAY, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY LEAVE.
THINK I'M GONNA BOW OUT.
            MAXINE, YOU PROMISED
            YOU'D GO.
            CRYSTAL'S A FRIEND
            WHO'S GONNA DRESS UP
        LIKE A FARM ANIMAL
        AND TOUCH HERSELF, COME.
I CAN'T HANDLE
AN ART SHOW RIGHT NOW.
                           OKAY.
I LOVE YOU.
              BYE.
BYE.
                    BYE, MAXINE.
         BYE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
ACCEPTING MY INVITATION.
   WELL, I COULDN'T HAVE REFUSED
   EVEN IF I WANTED TO.
               ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WILL INVITE THEM ALL
TO OUR WEDDING.
UM, WHAT ARE YOU DRINKING?
               IT'S KIND OF LIKE
               AN OLD FASHIONED.
                 WANT TO TRY IT?
  YEAH.
YOU KNOW, I CAN UM,
TIE A CHERRY STEM
INTO A KNOT
WITH MY TONGUE.
                          REAL--
                         UM...
             YEAH,
             THAT'S A GOOD LOOK.
THANK YOU.
I FEEL VERY SEXY.
I'M SURPRISED BY HOW
QUICKLY THEY SPRUNG INTO ACTION.
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
THEY EXPECTED ME
TO MAKE A HUGE MESS.
     OH, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
     A CONSPIRACY ON YOUR HANDS.
YES, I DO.
THIS IS NOT A CASE OF ME
BEING A CLUMSY OAF.
I AM A VICTIM
OF A LARGER FORCE.
             THE BAR AND ALCOHOL
             INDUSTRY.
YES.
                 OUT TO GET YOU.
YES, 'CAUSE THEY NEED A GIRL
LIKE ME TO, YOU KNOW,
HUMILIATE HERSELF, SO THAT
THE OTHER PATRONS
CAN FEEL
MORE CONFIDENT.
           YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY GET
           TO GO HOME
        WITH A DRINK AND A SHOW.
YEAH.
                       OKAY.
ARE YOU HORRIFIED?
IS THIS LIKE THE MOST
EMBARRASSING THING
YOU'VE EVER WITNESSED?
       I DON'T EMBARRASS EASILY.
I LIKE THAT.
              IT'S GETTING LATE.
   YEAH.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE MY PLACE?
I LIVE WITH THIS WOMAN
WHO MAY OR MAY NOT
BE PRACTICING WITCHCRAFT.
I'D LOVE TO INTRODUCE YOU.
        CAN I TAKE A RAIN CHECK?
YEAH, SURE, OF COURSE.
UM... GET THE CHECK, PLEASE?
THIS IS ON ME, LITERALLY
AND METAPHORICALLY.
       NO, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
NO, I SAID I GOT IT.
                 I GOT--
                 I GOT THIS ONE.
THANK YOU.
NO, I'VE--
LOOK, I GOT IT.
    I SAID I GOT IT.
       I'M NOT TAKING THIS BACK.
I INVITED YOU OUT.
                      OKAY.
  WHAT TRAIN YOU TAKING HOME?
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA STAY
AND USE THE BATHROOM.
YOU SHOULD JUST GO.
                  NO, I'LL WAIT.
NO, IT'S OKAY.
JUST GO.
               YOU ARE STUBBORN.
   YEAH.
THANKS FOR COMING OUT
WITH ME.
                 WELL, THANK YOU
                 FOR ASKING ME.
OKAY, BYE.
                            BYE.
              HI.
UM, CAN I HAVE THE CHEAPEST RED
          YOU'VE GOT?
           THANK YOU.
                  CAN I ASK WHAT
                  YOU'RE HAVING?
THE CHEAPEST RED THEY HAD.
                      HOW IS IT?
ALCOHOLIC.
WITH AN OAKY FINISH.
                    SOUNDS GOOD.
SORRY, I'M NOT WELL-VERSED
IN WINE TALK.
               "OAKY FINISH" WAS
               A NICE TOUCH.
THANKS.
                        I'M TED.
SHIRIN.
                     SHIRIN. HI.
     HI.
UM, DO YOU LIVE AROUND HERE?
                           HI.
              OH, HEY,
              WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?
        THIS IS SHIRIN.
              SHIRIN, I'M MARIE.
     HI.
 YEAH, WE UH, LIVE A FEW BLOCKS
      FROM HERE, ACTUALLY.
                          MM-HM.
COOL.
        HEY, DO YOU WANT TO COME
        SIT WITH US?
OKAY.
   I'M LIKE ONE BAD ROMANTIC
         ENCOUNTER AWAY
     FROM MOVING TO FRANCE
   AND CHANGING MY IDENTITY.
HMM.
DO YOU WANT AN OLIVE?
         NO, I'M OKAY.
   BUT MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO,
             LIKE,
  A LESS GLAMOROUS PLACE, LIKE
     SLOVENIA OR SOMETHING,
 WHERE MY CHANCES OF POPULARITY
       WOULD BE GREATER.
HMM.
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD.
I'M OKAY.
       WOULD YOU LIKE SOME WINE?
                 YEAH.
     WHY ARE YOU GIGGLING?
I'M JUST--
I'VE BEEN PLOTTING ON HOW
TO GET YOU EAT
ONE OF THESE OLIVES,
BECAUSE THEY'RE
COVERED IN GARLIC,
AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME.
              OH.
     I GUESS IT'S SORT OF AN ALL
     OR NOTHING KIND OF THING.
        PROBLEM SOLVED.
             YOU SHOULD SHOW HER
             YOUR LATEX OUTFIT.
    YOU HAVE A LATEX OUTFIT?
YEAH. YEAH, I HAVE TO
OIL UP TO PUT IT ON.
              WOW.
   YEAH, PLEASE PUT THAT ON.
OH.
            THANKS.
                          DRINK?
             YEAH.
   UM, SO IN WHAT SITUATION DOES
   A PERSON FIND THEMSELVES
        IN NEED OF LATEX OUTFIT?
BURLESQUE SHOWS,
PLAY PARTIES,
ALL KINDS OF PLACES,
REALLY.
                         AH.
         UM, OKAY, BUT--
         BUT HERE'S MY QUESTION.
                WHY DO THE WOMEN
                HAVE TO DRESS UP
           LIKE SLUTTY CUPCAKES?
           WHAT ABOUT THE DUDES?
WELL, I HAVE
A LATEX OUTFIT, TOO.
         THAT'S SOUNDS HORRIBLE.
OH, IT'S REALLY CUTE.
          I'LL HAVE TO TAKE
          YOUR WORD ON THAT ONE.
                      THANKS.
CHEERS.
                         CHEERS.
                   ARE YOU OKAY?
   YEAH.
I'M SORRY, I-- I JUST GOT
A LITTLE IN MY HEAD
FOR A MINUTE.
           NO, IT'S-- IT'S OKAY.
                      IT'S OKAY.
SO THIS IS MY FIRST TIME
DOING THIS.
      WELL, WE CAN TAKE IT SLOW.
THANK YOU.
                     I LIKE YOU.
                         A LOT.
THANK YOU.
I LIKE YOU, TOO.
          YOU KNOW WHAT?
          WE DON'T HAVE TO FUCK.
           YOU KNOW,
           WE CAN JUST HANG OUT,
     PLAY MONOPOLY OR SOMETHING.
THAT ACTUALLY SOUNDS
LIKE A LOT OF FUN.
        GREAT.
        I HAVE THE CLUE VERSION.
   OH.
                        YEAH.
THAT'S REALLY COOL.
                           YEAH.
IT'S AWESOME.
                          HONEY.
YOU TWO CAN STAY AS YOU ARE.
UM, I SHOULD GET DRESSED.
                      NO, DON'T.
IT'S OKAY.
UM, I SH-- I SHOULD GO.
                         NO, NO.
               TED, TED,
               TELL HER TO STAY.
                         THANKS.
I REALLY DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE THE LAST TIME
THAT WE SEE EACH OTHER.
                    ME, NEITHER.
HOW COME NO ONE SAID
    YOU HAD TO COME DRESSED
    AS ONE OF YOUR
    FAVORITE CHARACTERS FROM
    "THE LITTLE RASCALS"?
THAT'S THE GREAT THING
ABOUT PRIDE.
      PEOPLE HERE LOOK LIKE THEY
      DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE.
YOUR ATTITUDE IS REALLY
PISSING ME OFF.
                          SORRY.
     DID YOU SEE THE DRAG QUEEN?
     THAT'S MY FRIEND.
HOW COME THE ONLY ASPECT
OF GAY CULTURE
THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU
IS DRAG?
         HEY, WHAT AM I GOOD AT?
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT?
           DRINKING AND DANCING,
           REMEMBER?
                 LET'S HAVE FUN.
FINE.
                        KISS ME.
TWO VODKA RED BULLS,
PLEASE.
                      THANK YOU.
THANKS.
   AAH.
CAN I GET ANOTHER ONE?
YOU HAVIN' FUN?
                         SURE.
LOOK, BEFORE YOU ASK, NO,
I'M NOT AN F TO M TRANSSEXUAL.
UH, SORRY TO DISAPPOINT.
        WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
MY SISTER AND I MADE A BET.
           I'M GUESSING SHE WON?
AH... CORRECT.
                     I'M MAXINE.
  GEORGE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.
         I CAN SEE YOU.
                   SHIRIN, STOP.
           FUCK YOU.
           I'M SORRY.
  I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
                  WHAT THE FUCK?
HE'S A MAN.
IT WAS LIKE KISSING
A BABY.
                        WHAT?
IT'S JUST LIKE LIPS TOUCHING.
           I HATE YOU SO MUCH
           WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING.
I'M SO--
                DO NOT TOUCH ME.
   WHOA.
                   ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SHOVED ME OFF,
LIKE, REALLY VIOLENTLY.
              YOU CHEATED ON ME.
YOU HIT ME.
I FEEL SICK.
               PLEASE DON'T CRY.
DON'T.
         I'M SORRY.
         YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
WHO IS HE?
       JUST SOME GUY AT THE BAR.
       WE WERE JUST DRINKING.
AND YOU WERE LIKE,
"WANT TO KISS A LESBIAN?"
        IT ONLY LASTED A SECOND.
I WAS WATCHING YOU.
IT WAS FOREVER.
                     HEY.
                     I AM SORRY.
         YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
               WHO SPENDS $300
               ON A GARTER BELT?
        MAY I HELP YOU?
         UH, WE'RE JUST LOOKING.
ACTUALLY, YES.
UM, I'M LOOKING FOR
THE GROWN-UP UNDERWEAR
OF A WOMAN IN CHARGE
OF HER SEXUALITY
AND NOT AFRAID OF CHANGE.
         I'VE GOT THAT.
THIS JUST CAME IN
FROM FRANCE.
                IT'S A BIT PINK.
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
TRY IT ON FOR YOURSELF?
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU NEED,
AND I'LL GET A ROOM READY
FOR YOU.
  I ACTUALLY NEED TO STOCK UP
          ON PANTIES.
        MY EX-GIRLFRIEND
    UH, CUT UP MOST OF MINE,
    SO I'M GONNA NEED MORE.
WHAT ABOUT BRAS?
      I DON'T WEAR THOSE.
WHY NOT?
   JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH
         TO WORK WITH,
          SO IT FEELS
        A LITTLE SILLY.
      YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN
   LITTLE GIRLS CARRY PURSES.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
                       SHIRIN.
   SHIRIN.
YOU ARE A WOMAN,
AND YOU HAVE BREASTS,
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH THEM.
YEAH, I KNOW.
YOU DESERVE A SEXY,
SUPPORTIVE BRA,
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER
WOMAN.
             OKAY.
YOU WERE WITH A WOMAN
FOR HOW LONG,
AND SHE DIDN'T HELP YOU
FIND THE RIGHT BRA?
            A WHILE.
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR EX--
WHAT'S HER NAME?
            MAXINE.
SOUNDS LIKE MAXINE WAS
DESTRUCTIVE TO YOUR PANTIES
AND YOUR SELF-ESTEEM.
                   I'M SO SORRY.
       IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
           I'M FINE.
 I JU-- I JUST NEED UNDERWEAR.
JUST BECAUSE YOUR BREASTS
ARE SMALL
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE NOT LEGITIMATE.
            I KNOW.
IT'S OKAY TO BE ANGRY.
                     OH, MY GOD.
LET'S TRY THAT ON.
  YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T
    THINK I DESERVED A BRA,
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE MYSELF
AS A REAL WOMAN.
IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN
JUST FABRIC.
  YEAH, AND I'VE BEEN WEARING
   BIKINI BOTTOMS FOR MONTHS.
WELL, THAT'S BASICALLY
INVITING PEOPLE
WHO DON'T RESPECT YOU
INTO YOUR BEDROOM.
   THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID,
  AND NOW I'M LIKE SEEING HER
    AT A PARTY ON SATURDAY,
   AND HOW DO I EXPECT ANYONE
      TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY
   IF I AM NOT WEARING A BRA?
           I TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.
      THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
           STUNNING.
       GOD, I HATE YOUR FRIENDS.
MY FRIENDS ARE MY FAMILY.
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT'S LIKE,
TO HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN
FAMILY BECAUSE THE ONE
YOU WERE BORN INTO--
     OH, COME ON, ENOUGH OF THIS
     LESBIAN ORPHAN PROPAGANDA.
        YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL BORN
        INTO SHIT FAMILIES.
                WE DEAL WITH IT.
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
    MY PROBLEM IS I HAVEN'T BEEN
    FUCKED IN LIKE THREE WEEKS.
I AM NOT GONNA TALK
ABOUT THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY.
            ON YOUR BIRTHDAY?
            WHAT ARE YOU, EIGHT?
     SO YOU HAPPENED TO BE BORN.
     BIG FUCKING DEAL.
OH, I'M SORRY, ALL ATTENTION
MUST REVOLVE AROUND YOU
100% OF THE TIME.
I FORGOT.
            NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
            I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I GET
SO SHOCKED WHEN YOU
DO SHIT LIKE THIS.
YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN
IN A CREEPY,
CO-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR PARENTS.
            IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL,
            AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
       WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
       BECAUSE YOU COMPLETELY
       ABANDONED YOUR FAMILY.
IT WASN'T A CHOICE!
       OF COURSE, IT'S A CHOICE!
SAYS THE CLOSET CASE!
     THEY KNOW I KNOW THEY KNOW.
       I'M WAITING FOR THE RIGHT
       TIME TO BRING IT UP,
        OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEM.
I THINK YOU AND I SEE THE WORLD
TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY.
      WE DO. YOU KNOW, YOU THINK
      THAT I'M A BAD PERSON
      BECAUSE I'M NOT COMING OUT
      ON YOUR TERMS,
    AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.
THAT IS NOT TRUE.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
            THAT'S TOTALLY TRUE.
 YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.
       I'M LISTENING TO YOU, AND
        EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING
      IS PISSING ME OFF
      AND COMPLETELY INACCURATE.
YOU ARE RUINING MY BIRTHDAY.
     YOU'RE RUINING MY TWENTIES.
I CAN'T--
I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE
TO DEAL WITH YOU.
          THAT'S FINE.
        LET'S BREAK UP.
                           FINE.
       OKAY.
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO, JUST GO.
YOU DON'T GET TO TAKE THINGS.
I GOT YOU THOSE PANTIES.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
FUCK YOU.
                WHAT THE FUCK IS
                WRONG WITH YOU?
I GOT THESE FOR YOU.
                YOU'RE A FUCKING
                CRAZY PERSON!
                YOU WANT TO PLAY
                LIKE THIS?
DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS?
OKAY.
I BOUGHT ALL THE BOOZE
FOR THIS PARTY.
ARE YOU HAPPY?
IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?
  YOU KNOW WHAT-- DON'T BOTHER
  TELLING YOUR PARENTS ABOUT US.
        I KNOW YOU, AND THE MORE
        THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,
 THIS IS PROBABLY JUST A PHASE.
              GOD, THIS WAS SUCH
              A WASTE.
              HEY.
         HI.
           NICE HAIR.
THANKS.
      THIS IS JON FRANCIS.
                 THIS IS MAXINE.
         JON, SHOW HER
       YOUR CHEST TATTOO.
    IT TOOK THEM FOUR HOURS
           TO DO IT.
           IT'S A GIANT SQUID
           BITING A SPERM WHALE.
    COOL.
          HOW ARE YOU?
I'M OKAY.
YOU?
             GOOD.
YOU SHOULD MEET MY DATE.
         WHERE IS SHE?
AT THE BAR,
GETTING US DRINKS.
             GREAT.
      SHE SOUNDS AWESOME.
    SHE IS.
GOD, LOOK HOW THINGS WORKED OUT
        FOR BOTH OF US.
     YOU HAVE YOUR LADY WHO
  FETCHES YOU DRINKS AT A BAR,
    LIKE A MAID, AND I HAVE
  MY HUNKY REBEL WITH A CAUSE.
OH, WHAT'S THE CAUSE?
 JON'S SPEARHEADING A CAMPAIGN
       TO BRIDGE THE GAPS
 OF GENTRIFICATION IN BROOKLYN
 THROUGH MASS KOMBUCHA BREWING.
THAT'S NOT A THING.
       YEAH, WE'RE GONNA
         GO DANCE NOW.
 JON'S KNOWN ALL OVER BUSHWICK
       FOR HIS VOGUEING.
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.
T's AN AMAZING DANCER.
          OH, IS SHE?
YEAH.
SHE GOES TO HER WEST AFRICAN
DANCE CLASS RELIGIOUSLY.
         IS SHE BLACK?
    NO.
          SHE SOUNDS AWESOME.
            SHE IS.
                          TIBET?
          HEY, SHIRIN.
              THIS IS YOUR DATE?
YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER?
                   YEAH, WE WORK
                   TOGETHER.
             TIBET,
      THIS IS JON FRANCIS.
         JON, SHOW HER
       YOUR CHEST TATTOO.
UH, TIBET'S
A FORMER HAIR MODEL.
YEAH, I HEARD.
   MAXINE AND I USED TO DATE.
        CAN YOU IMAGINE?
                           NOPE.
            WHY NOT?
    I THOUGHT YOU WERE STRAIGHT.
              FUCK YOU.
WHOA, THAT IS UNCALLED FOR!
   YOUR HAIR IS UNCALLED FOR.
BABY, LET'S GO GET HIGH.
   I DON'T WANT TO GET HIGH.
                       WHATEVER.
WHAT IS UP WITH YOUR PASSIVE
DISINTEREST IN EVERYTHING?
SERIOUSLY, WHAT HAPPENED
AT WESLEYAN
THAT DID THIS TO YOU?
  MAXINE, MAYBE WE SHOULD GO.
             OH, SHUT UP, TIBET.
               NO ONE CARES WHAT
               YOU HAVE TO SAY.
         YOU HAVE THE SEX APPEAL
         OF A FERRET.
                    I'M IN HERE.
IT'S MAXINE.
                        GO AWAY.
THE DOOR WAS UNLOCKED.
      I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD
      TRY TO REPLACE ME
                WITH THAT FETUS.
I'M NOT TRYING
TO REPLACE YOU.
                     I HATE JON.
I KNOW.
TAKE A CAB HOME.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
        ALL RIGHT, OKAY,
   EVERYBODY PLEASE COME SIT.
         I HAVE A FILM.
EVERYBODY STOP PLAYING
       AND COME WATCH THE MOVIE.
         ALRIGHT, SO THIS IS ONE
         OF THE FIRST FILMS
              THAT WAS EVER MADE
              FOR AUDI--
IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE
FOR OUR AGE.
           WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
           LIKE THAT?
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
      KUJO, GROUCHO, WHY ARE YOU
      NOT SITTING HERE?
           I'M SCREENING A FILM.
         WE'RE WATCHING A MOVIE.
              YES!
   NO, I WANT YOU RIGHT HERE.
WHAT HAPPENED?
   OKAY...
DO WE GOTTA CLEAN
ALL THAT UP?
               THERE'S TOO MUCH.
                      HEY, GUYS.
                       LEAVE IT.
                  JUST LEAVE IT.
                       NEW PLAN.
   I SAY FORGET THE STOP MOTION.
           WHAT MOVIE
   DO YOU GUYS WANT TO MAKE?
          I WANT TO MAKE A MOVIE
          ABOUT FARTS.
        ALRIGHT, GREAT.
          LET'S DO IT.
                   FARTS.
      ZOMBIES!
                        ZOMBIES?
                        AWESOME.
            BOOGERS!
          WHAT ELSE HAVE WE GOT?
          IT'S A GOOD START.
      WHAT ELSE DO WE HAVE HERE?
     I WANT BOOGERS IN MY MOVIE.
            BOOGERS.
          THERE WE GO.
                 BUTTS.
BUTTS.
   YOU GUYS ARE IN THE ZONE.
        KEEP IT FLOWING.
NAKED NINJAS!
               I'M NOT A ZOMBIE.
               I'M JUST A BOY.
        BUT YOU'RE MAKING
        THE ZOMBIE MASK.
       IT DOESN'T MATTER
    IF IT'S YOUR CHARACTER.
   YOU'RE JUST MAKING IT UP.
           CAN IT HAVE MORE EYES
           THAN TWO?
              YES.
   ZOMBIES HAVE AS MANY EYES
   AS YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE.
  WELCOME TO THE "BROOKLYN KIDZ
         MOOVIE MAKER,
        FINAL SCREENING."
             FIRST WE SCREEN
             THE ADVANCED CLASS,
  AND THE NON-ADVANCED CLASS.
     THANK YOU FOR COMING.
      I WROTE THAT SPEECH.
        I LOVE FARTING.
         I CAN'T FART.
OH, YOU GUYS.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
YOU'RE WELCOME.
          YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
SHIRIN.
                   HI, KEN.
SO, THAT WAS...
                   DISGUSTING.
                   I'M SO SORRY.
ACTUALLY, I THOUGHT
IT WAS HILARIOUS.
                      SERIOUSLY?
YEAH.
I WAS CRACKIN' UP.
               THANK YOU SO MUCH
               FOR SAYING THAT.
 YEAH.
LET'S FACE IT,
FARTS ARE FUNNY.
                I AGREE.
                FARTS ARE FUNNY.
                      THANK YOU.
HAVE YOU SEEN CARRINGTON?
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?
                         HIDING.
        I'M SORRY I'VE BEEN
        SUCH A DICK ABOUT LAYLI.
AW, COME ON,
FORGET IT.
COME ON, LET'S GO INSIDE.
    MY OLD ROOMMATE MAXINE AND I
    WERE IN A RELATIONSHIP.
AH, SO YOU'RE A LESBIAN.
        I WAS PRETTY INTO
        ALL THE GUYS I WAS WITH,
        SO I THINK I'M BISEXUAL.
AND THAT'S A THING?
                  I'M AFRAID SO.
ALL RIGHT.
    HOW DO YOU THINK MOM AND DAD
    ARE GONNA TAKE IT?
OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
TELL THEM NOW THAT IT'S OVER.
   SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG THING
   TO NOT BE HONEST ABOUT.
FINE.
JUST UH, WAIT UNTIL AFTER
THE WEDDING, ALRIGHT?
            YOU ARE SUCH A DICK.
WELL, AT LEAST I'M NOT
A SEXUALLY CONFUSED NARCISSIST.
CAN WE PLEASE GO INSIDE?
                  HEY, CAN I BE
                  YOUR BEST MAN?
NO,
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I ATE BEFORE I CAME.
OW, FUCK!
OW! SHIT.
I'M SORRY I RUINED
YOUR SCARF.
MOM, I'M A LITTLE BIT GAY.
YES, I AM.
AND I WAS IN LOVE
WITH MAXINE.
                            SHH.
           SHIRIN, ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY.
         STOP BREATHING SO LOUD.
OKAY.
HAS YOUR MOM
MENTIONED IT?
                             NO.
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEANT.
          NO, SHE KNOWS FOR SURE
          WHAT'S UP.
            I'M GONNA BRING IT
            UP IN ABOUT A MONTH.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
                         THANKS.
        THERE'S A PARTY
        AT THE LOFT ON SATURDAY.
           YOU SHOULD BRING THAT
           WAITER, BRENDAN.
UM, I WOULD, BUT I KINDA
WANT TO SEE IF JACQUES
AND FELICIA TRY TO SEDUCE ME.
        IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.
      I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU THINK
      THEY'RE SWINGERS.
I JUST GET THAT VIBE.
YOU SHOULD INVITE
THAT GAY LAWYER.
DID YOU GUYS TOUCH TONGUES?
                  NO, WE DIDN'T,
            AND IT ACTUALLY HURT
            MY FEELINGS.
NO, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD
WHO GO ON FIRST DATES
THAT ARE PERFECTLY GREAT,
AND THEN THEY WAIT A WHILE
BEFORE THEY ENGAGE
IN SEXUAL CONTACT.
              THAT'S DISGUSTING.
I KNOW, I THINK IT ALL HAPPENS
OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK.
             MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHEN HE TEXTS ME,
IT'S LIKE HE ONLY TEXTS ME
USING EMOTICONS.
WHY CAN'T YOU
USE YOUR WORDS?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I THINK THAT HE THINKS THAT
THAT IS LIKE CUTE.
I AND LIKE...
