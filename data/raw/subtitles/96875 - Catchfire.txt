That is Miio' s investment
We just play the dice
The price will go up to roof
Huh... - who cares? Never learns... -
Yeah, anything you want
I only want information
How cold is this trail?
Thirty hours... - thirty fucking hours
i think we' ii stop for some food
I hate to call him a man
I hate him
Are you hungry?
Have you eaten enough butter?
Some... - some we haven' t thought of yet
You' d better think of your stomach
How we find her?
Hi, Milo, what do you think?
Ha... - you' ii get a view... -

You' ii get upstairs
If you find out that wig

i' ii get you a fucking boat
What do you think
Can you work here alright, Milo?
Yeah... - by noon tomorrow
I need a list of names of friends... -

I need a phone company inside there
to trace any long distance calls
I need three computers
for cross reference
on certificate duplicates
and security applications
new in last few days
i can' t think of anything eise
that I need by now
Simple, my man John Napoli will get
anything that you need
Right, John? He is my lawyer
Who is De Helinis?
Prosecutor from the Justice Department
His name is Paulie
Paulie is lousy, Mr. Coreilli
That's good
Passions are hard things that you can seal
Passions are hard things that you can seal
Yes
My client is getting nervous, Milo
Yeah, don' t biame them
So many things need to clean up
i' ii get it... -
will take me awhile
It gotta be all night long
for this ballistic thing
We really need a strong hit man
something like an automatic machine
0nly ballistic
How about you?
You' ve got any idea or what?
Am I having any idea?
You may get out of my department
You' ve been on it aimost 2 months
The trail is cold
and nothing' s achieved
Yeah, what my colleagues
are looking for?
I get to nail down the three cities
from Seattle to Washington DC
and find out that Model of the Duke
Ah... - visual aspects
This concerns with preferences
in the state of concept
as well as the concept itself
Conceptual art... -
concerns just with the concept
Known... - unknown... - unknown
known... - unknown... - unknown
Known that would be unknown
known... - unknown... -
What the fuck am I doing?
Why should I bother?
What the shit... -
Hey, I like that... -
Protect me from what I want
What the hell is this?
Protect me from what I want?
I have got you
Hello, Margaret
Hurrah, a baby is being born into the world
Your life that day will be a success
That' s aii i have to say for now
Don' t worry about me
Everything will be fine
Anne Benton... - Anne Benton... -

Take your men around that way
Could be across that bridge
Go over there
God damn son of a bitch

You put me in a world
with such a product
Hi, Margaret, I have to move again
Travel the last two days
I am tired
The art teacher finds a place
for me to stay
i can' t teii you where i am
We will keep in touch
After the door, clear the mud
You leave it there too
0h, i don' t know what i' ii do
This place belongs to a Ionely
art collector from El Pasa
He never comes up here
He just ships his stuff up
from time to time
And I suppose to keep the house
for all this
0nce a time i' ii come
to pick up the mail
i' ii get out of the city for awhiie
i' ii be back in a few weeks
0h, there' s a very nice bedroom
right up those stairs
You' ii feei very comfortabie here
0h Jesus, i' ve been here
for a long time
A form like this is impractical
What did you say you' re working it for?
I work for banks in America
I need a hundred pieces
for lobbies up and down in the stadium
I really need to talk them in
The bank stuff is not really good
too distracted and too servile
It is not the business as usual
There is something less distracted and abstracted
My friend Firnelli Dill... -
he works on concrete
I used to work in concrete too... -
sur"' or"'
What an artist... -
You know, if I see you again

Pay this

Get in the fucking car
Hi, Margaret... -
Getting away from my work these days

What are you looking at?
Well, a picture shows the same place

Angei 0' Ciiff

She usually paints flowers that I like her much
Yes, you get it
Very pretty, I like them
Nice to meet you
Must be scared driving a thing like this
Well yes to start with

If you use your brain like you use your ass,
you did genius
Come on, Rody
Hi, Margaret, may I guess... -
Now I may believe that I am safe
No one knows where I am
Actually everything will be forgotten
I shall be forgotten too
i don' t know if i can with peopie again
...- i don' t know
I am not fit for anymore
To be cut off like a movie action
I do have the fantasy
that there' s a man in the dark
I see his face
which seems like a scar round my neck
I know that I am going to die
Nothing will make any difference
Dino, tell the boys no red wine in my friger
Are you kidding me or what?
We are already busy with the job
and you tell me to bother
your fucking garbage, uh?
Don' t take your shit out on me, Dino
Get the fuck out of here
and get to your head or something
Your fucking ass
Boss, I am just thinking... -
Boss? This fucking job
I told you guys many times
You get to make me like a boss
But now, how can I be a fucking boss?
All this fucking what?
Making me only a fucking kingpin
Boss, more bad news... -
nobody has seen Milo since yesterday
Where is he
He is in New Mexico
You can see the postmark there... - NM
i don' t know what is going wrong
with this guy
He is not a team player
I can get my fucking finger on him
Let me go after him, boss
i am sorry... - i won' t fuck up
I am a team player
What the fuck you laugh at?
We can afford to let him go
Let him go
You think it right
That' s right
Take fucking one
You get to go... - you get to go
Your wife mentioned no red wines in the friger
Hi, cowboy
What are you doing here, uh?
What are you doing here?
It' s not very smart
You' re taking off without ieaving
a word to any of us, including me
Including me uh, Milo
Get in there
How did you get here?
Teii me you didn' t find out
You didn' t give me caii
Teii me you didn' t do that
What did you expect me to do?
Now police must know we are here
That means everybody knows
we' ve been here
You dummy asshole
i' m not dumb
i' ve been watching you spy on her
You' re supposed to kiii her
But you' re just watching
Did I say it right?
I will kill her
We have not had a serious murder
like this in seven or eight years
You will have another one
if you don' t move fast
You know this woman?
You know what I am here to do
I know everything about you
You know nothing about me
All you need to know about
is I am giving you a choice
Either I finish you now
or I let you live
If I let you live, your life is mine
and you belong to me
If you go against me in any way
I will finish you
The choice is yours, make it
I want to live
Do you understand?
Where? Who killed him?
Who killed... - where is Milo?
Where is... -
They killed the fucking kid
They killed the kid
Who is Milo?
I don' t know
We lost him
Who is fucking Milo?
Morning
No, to the lady, we like to have
grape fruit, dry hot wheat toast
orange juice and a glass of lemon tea
We don' t have iemon tea
Then red tea with lemon in
Did you forbid the proposition?
Hey, I would like a hamburger with steak
medium rare
green salad plus a cup of black coffee
Fine
Thanks
You like simple food
You had six Mustands
in the past eight years
You got scars in your knees
in a car accident when you were a kid
You said things in letters
Your favorite movie is "The Last Tango in Paris"
You are allergic to certain kinds of cosmetics,
especially Max Factor
0h no, be good
Thank you
Yeah
May I ask you a question?
Sure
Is it kidnapping or what?
Well, you could call that
Then what would you call it?
I don' t know
Why didn' t you kiii me iike you kiiied Bob?
I didn' t kiii Bob
I keep on asking that
But you wiii kiii him, won' t you?
It would have killed you
Well then, make yourself comfortable
Put on your night gown
Anne, you like a coke from the machine
or something?
I always thought you are pretty
but I never knew
How beautiful you are?
Did someone say to you?
There' s something going on here
that i reaiiy don' t understand?
But I like it... - oh shit
But you know what I mean
I know... - did you know what I mean?
I am not just good to talk
0h God, look at you
okay, you can trust me
Could I be able to trust you?
Because I never loved anybody before
But I love you
You need some breakfast?
No
You get to eat some
I am not hungry
Come on, you can jump later overboard.
Anne, you get to cheer up
i don' t think you can understand
the situation just like that
The moon changes and the sun is down
The moon is red, the sky is green
the sea is pink
But we are the world here
If you are thinking of an escape
you are thinking to die
You have made the choice
it' s the oniy choice that you had
and you made it
i don' t know whether you' re a murderer
or a rapist
0ne way or another you' re just
a fucking asshole
i don' t think you reaiize
what i' ve done
i can' t go back
Just think the police and they
are looking for you,
probably harder
Please understand they want to
kill us both now
You get to face the hard reality here
The probiem is you' re an artist
You have no sense of hard reality
You know you live in a dream world
Milo... -
Ivory towers... -
But me? I am an opportunist
You get to learn sense of reality
You just can' t sit in and dream
Get out and you count the pavement
You know, are you really listening
what i' m taiking, aren' t you?
Shit, God damn it, you get to teach me
or something
and you get that fucking scar
I can hear you... - Anne, come on
Anne, it is obvious of you... - come on
I guess I owe you that one
Come on... - come on... - come on
You are afraid of me
Afraid of you? I am not afraid of you
Why should I be afraid of a guy
trying so hard to kidnap a girl
and yet have sex with her?
Anne... -
Don' t touch me
Jesus Christ... -
Already days and years
sex... - i don' t iive with
I have done it
i' m not so hard feeiing for it... - you know
Maybe you could... - you know... - teach me
You think you could do that, Anne?
Could you teach me?
I can' t beiieve you bought aii these
Did you go to all my stores?
I thought you would look nice with them
Is it that it is all about?
You want me to put these all on
for you, uh?
Why not?
I thought it would be fun
I gave up my career for you
I gave up my life
You could just do this little for me... -
You put the shit on... -
Fine... - big man with a gun
Here... - here
Hey, not in there... - here... - come on
Huh, no problem, I can afford it
You are a hooker, Milo
A little playboy set for low class
Is this what you want?
That would be nice... - oh... - slower
Let me tell you something
about men, Milo
They have no imagination
You have no imagination
I do have imagination
I do a lot of things
You like it?
You reaiiy iike this, don' t you?
I know... - what about I tie you up?
That will be exciting
Huh... - I like that
Maybe we may then know
each other better
Chicken... -
It seems our friend Milo has left his friends
of the circle
I think he is taking the girl
and bed with him
It is impossible
Milo is a professional
We don' t even have his prints
nor do we have any hints of his victim
I bet you will get me new jeans
Don' t iook so bad
Milo... -
What... what...?
What is it like?
What is what' s it iike?
What' s it iike being with me?
It is job... - i don' t think much about it
What do you feel like doing it?
No, i don' t feei iike it today
You just make sure don' t do it again
Come on... - you don' t feei heated?
Let me put to you this way
i don' t go out ever right after
big meals
i' d rather say it this way
Miio, you can' t keep thinking
i' ii do anything you want
That is not fair... -
that is not right
This is my life, not yours
No, this is not your life... -
this is not mine either
This is our life, Anne... - under the table
At the front door
That' s the back door
At the front door, Anne
They are coming at the back
Hey... -
They had no head
Want a bite?
Come on, you bastard
Maybe you pull over, let me drive
do you good
Here it is?
Yeah, I guess it is
Go... - go move the car
Go out of here
Milo... -
What is the matter?
There' s a baby goat or iamb or something
It got stuck in leakage... -
...we must help pull it out
Where... where...?
Come on... -
This is the Rocky Mountain... -
No... -
This is the back of the Himalayas
The what?
This is Casamero Pueblo Ruins... -
the Chaco Canyon
It was a communal village dwelling of
abode and stone
as built by American Indians in Mexico
Can you see everything?
Look, over there is Chicago
Tell me some secrets about yourself... -
something you never told me before
You already know me everything
0h, come on... -
0kay, i' ii teii you secrets
I never told anybody before
Actuaiiy it' s very embarrassing
Yeah, embarrassing?
And disgusting too
Disgusting? Alright... -
it' s a very embarrassing experience... -
Well, I was sitting in a cafe in Paris
I had my vegetable salad, mineral water
Caribbean scallop and a glass of white wine
And suddenly I took the hostess
to my room
doing something I had never done before
You naughty girl
You' re right, it is disgusting
You know the safest place for us?
Where?
New Zealand
Milo... -
I am serious
New Zealand... - that is the place
There are lots of people and views... -
you will love it
We' ii take a carnivai boat... -
somewhat like a sea cruise
0niy it' s better with fewer asshoies
We' ii meet new friends
simply by taking little cruise, uh?
I do fix it
I love it... -
but iet' s get reai for a second
I can do everything
since I started killing people, you know
I am old now... -
it' s time for a change
I can do electrical work
I can do carpentry
0h, that is fine for you
Then, what about me? I mean... -
I need people... - I need museum... -
I need galleries... -
I need cultural environment... -
0h, cultural environment... -
Yeah... -
who is the proper asshole now?
Don' t give me the crap
Crap? I mean... - that' s my work... -
that is my iife... - i' m an artist
Hello, thank you an artist... -
Let me tell you my art, baby
You' re teiiing me about art?
Don' t you know art is iike a symboi?
Art is Charlie Parker
Art is whatever his name it may be
You call yourself an artist
But your art doesn' t exist
without the wall suckers plucking in to
0h my God, Moran... -
You are Moran and Frankenstein... -
you know that?
Yeah, but I get the idea for you
Why don' t you just go right back
to the fucking wall sockets?
Maybe I will
Fine
Fine
Fine, here are the fucking keys, go on
I am going
Take all this with you... -
you miserable creature
Milo, listen... -
how could they find us?
It is impossible
They must have got my employer
0kay, I admit it, I fuck up... -
are you happy now?
Where is your Himalayas?
Just right down here
Alright, stop
0Id, thank God
You want to try with that thing?
No
In that case, I do
Get in there
You alright, Milo?
Yeah, i' ii be airight
Wait here a minute
Fuck you all, son of bitches
It is old Casamero Pueblo Ruins
down here
used to be a city
where thousands of families lived in
It was like fucking L.A. Today
All the reefs over here used to be
a waterfront
They had the largest navy in the world
They were all in the water
Then one day the Rocky Mountain threw in the ocean
It all happened over
two hundred million years ago
0h shit... -
Milo, how much petrol we have left?
Forget it
0kay
You didn' t smoke
i don' t
Milo, we are okay
i' m afraid there' s nothing eise
we can do
What do you mean?
This is as far as we are being allowed
Why?
You don' t know these peopie
like I do... - shit
I was the one living in the dream world
I can hardly believe... -
You are a hit man
What is that supposed to mean?
You hit people... - hit them
0h, sure
Just take a couple of them
and a couple of lawyers
Exactly, why not?
Dino
Piease, if you don' t get fuck

I expect some consideration from Antonio
What do you want?
I want to talk
Get him here... - get him here
We want to talk too, Milo
Why don' t you come on over here?
We would just sit down for once

No, that' s out of the question, Miio
Why don' t we meet in my office?
Wouid you think i' m stupid?
