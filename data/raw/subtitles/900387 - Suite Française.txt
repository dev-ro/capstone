PARIS, JUNE 3rd 1940.
BUSSY,CENTRAL FRANCE.
ONE WEEK LATER
It begun with the storm
in June.
In the days before German
bombs had fallen
on the outskirts of Paris
for the first time.
Terryfying the people leaving the city
anyway they could.
But deep in the countryside
the war still felt far away.
And I remained preoccupied with the one
I was already fighting much closer to home.
Not dressed yet?
We'll be late.
Do you really think we
should go out today?
Why not?
My mother in law,
Madame Anzhelier.
refused to accept the
prospect of defeat.
Even as the first refugees from Paris
started to arrive.
Three years before I had married
her precious son,
in my father's insistence
and moved to Bussy.
With Gaston away fighting, she felt I
should learn how to run his properties.
So, every month we visited
our tenants.
On a Sunday, because madam knew
the farmers would be home.
Don't make any noise, that way you
see how they really live.
She liked to catch them out.
I hated every minute of it.
- Have you heard anything from your son?
- No. Not for over a week. And you?
- No, nothing from either of our boys.
- People say Paris is going to fall.
People say a lot of things.
This Is everything?
Madam, it's a big farm,
and it's been difficult
without my brothers.
Put down what they owe us
for the next month.
If I make any exceptions
then Gaston
wouldn't  have a home
of his own to return to.
And then what would he
have been fighting for?
Come along, Lucille.
Good morning.
They won't pay the rent,
but they don't think twice buing silk
stockings for that daughter of theirs.
You see?
I know it seems harsh, but if you show
them any weakness, they'll bleed you dry.
When Gaston comes home he'll see he has
a wife he knows what it is to be a land...
Stop! Stop the car!
- You should turn back.
- No.
We've got potatoes to buy
four more rents to collect...
Mad men...
- It looks heavy.
- He can manage.
- How much do I owe you?
- 4 francs.
Thank you.
There are more cars on the road,
from Paris.
My father always said:
If you want to see what people are
trully made of you start the war.
What is this?
Go and see how long they are on foot.
Excuse me, madam! I wouldn't ask
for me, but my wife is very tired.
We walked all the way from Paris.
Could she rest in your car.
Yes! Yes, of course!
Oh, Lord.
- That is ours?
- These guys are always theirs.
 Anna! Anna!
- Thank you.
- Lucille.
- We have to get out off the road.
- Could you take us to the nearest town?
Hey, you!
Get away from my car!
Lucille, get in the car!
When I tell you to do something
damn well do it.
So this was war.
Paris had suddenly
descended on Bussy.
Women and children escaping the bombs
looking for food and shelter.
But the enemy had
followed them here.
- Move, move!
- Madam Caren?
It's Lucille Anzhelier...
Gaston's wife!
Get out of my damn way!
You've got to leave
they are coming!
Abandoned populations.
Trust the German soldiers.
And so, France is formally
recognized for occupied.
However, you should not
be discouraged.
The occupation will not
affect of everyday life.
The most important thing is to go the extra
mile not prove unnecessary resistance.
Be polite to the
German soldiers,
and they will respond
to you with the same.
Remember that soldiers
are people.
Respect them,
and do not be afraid.
Fear had ceased the town.
Rumours spread that a regiment
was heading to Bussy.
I left no valuables
in Gaston's office.
Madame Anzhelier would rather
see his things burned,
than in the hands
of their soldiers.
Reverant of Bussy!
A great tragedy has
befallen our nation.
Millions have left their homes.
Many thousands have lost their lives.
And the fate of a whole generation of
brave young men still remains unknown.
Only God knows what's
in stow for all of us.
And the country that we can
no longer call our own.
We must hold firm together.
We must put aside anything
that would divide us from our neighbor.
We must unite into one being,
one family,
under God.
They are here allready.
Let us pray.
 Our Father, who are in heaven.
Hallowed be thy name,
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done, on earth
as it is in heaven,
Give us our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespassies,
as we forgive those who trespass,
against us,
Thy us not into temptation,
and deliver us from evil.
Amen.
Under the authority and the
signature of Marshal Pétain.
the new constitution of the
french state has signed
Guarantee your right to freedom,
Live and work.
You are defeated.
And we are now in charge.
All firearms must be surrended
to german headquarters
tomorrow morning.
According to the plan of the Führer, this
region is our beachhead. This means...
- How long they will be here?
- I do not know.
Damned if I am living
by german time.
Those who have been
billeted an officer,
should return home
and prepare for their arrival.
We do not look at him
we do not speak to him.
Good afternoon.
Madame?
Madame Anzhelier?
I'm Fon Falk. Bruno von Falk.
You have been told to
expect me?
Madame?
I'll try not to
inconvenience you.
I only require room
and somewhere to work.
Excuse me.
I hope you do not mind.,
I can't be late.
He didn't say anything
about the dog.
Attention!
Curfew!
Dear Lord bless these gifts
we are about to receive.
May he bless those unable
to share his bounty with us.
Guide them from danger.
Keep them safe.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Madame?
I kindly request the key
to the piano, and the desk.
I give you my word that they will
be treated with outmost care.
Marthe will give you the key.
Good evening.
They will be playing Deutschland
Uber Alles before we know it.
- Did you find somewhere to stay?
- Yes, thank you.
 Beware of nasty Jewish omen.
Did you see this one?
We must use german money.
We can't go out after nine.
And God help you, if they found
you listen De Gaulle on the radio.
- Have you got anyone?
- An officer.
Surprised if you didn't have in the
best house in the village I suppose.
- And you?
- Nobody.
The only benefit of
having the worst.
Why did she look
at me like that?
You do not know?
Your mother in law moved her
and her parents into a barn.
Then she put a refugee
from Paris into their home.
And doubled the rent.
Next.
Name, occupation, address?
Benoit Labarie, farmer.
Manmoro state.
Next.
- Contess?
- Benoit!
Excuse me! Your wife and children were
in church yesterday, where were you?
Working. Not that you know
anything about that.
Benoit, please, be careful
what you say to them.
They are tennants for generations
and if there is anything...
Bonnet, you will find a home.
Do you understand me, I have a request.
If you can, of course.
What is your request?
Could we discuss it
how to say it... alone.
Bonnet, leave us.
Thank you.
- I'll go.
- Sit.
- Please.
- Thank you.
I understand that officer Bonnet
was sent at Chateau.
Yes, really.
That's true.
Seems to us that it is more comfortable
to accommodate at the center.
- I understand.
- They see you, banner a translator.
And it is good to live in
the house of the mayor.
You know, this isn't my request.
The lady of the house is very scared,
troublesome, but wealthy.
If you could choose another
address another house,
- Where then send the Lieutenant?
- To the farmers. There the air is clean.
He'll like it.
For exaple farm Labarie.
I will not stay debtor.
Get inside.
That it is to I'm afraid
along with everything else.
There have been no men outside
for so long.
The mothers of French soldiers
looked on with disgust,
and begged God to curse them.
Can I help you?
 - But the young women just looked.
- You are beautiful, what is your name?
 Celine.
C-e-l-i-n.
Celine, can I have a
word with you please?
Can I carry those bags for you?
I'm going that way anyway.
Say no, thank you.
That's not for in here.
You are not going to let this.
Makes you feel any better?
Everybody can afford he is doing it.
My mother in law pretented
we were united in war,
But the well off continued
 to eat their own wheat
and count their own money
into hell along with anyone else.
Others, like Benoit Madeleine, wouldn't
have eat it  even if they had the chance.
This is for you.
It's just we have food to spare.
If you know what I mean.
You must miss Gaston?
Not having someone else to talk to.
Yes, I do.
- Do you write to him?
- We do not know where he is.
You should write anyway.
Make you feel better.
Oh God, Benoit would do anything
to swap places with Gaston.
- To have faught like a man.
- Really?
Yes. If you do not believe me,
you can ask him for yourself.
- Can we help you?
- Madame...
There has been a change of plan.
I have been billeted with you.
I apologize for
the inconvenience.
But they said we were too far from
the village to have anyone.
I was surprised myself.
I was staying at the Chateau.
- You're an officer?
- A Lieutenant.
Because this is just
a farmer house.
The rooms we'll be give,
we haven't even got running water.
You need not to
worry about me.
This will do nicely.
Come to me.
This young officer relished his power to
disrupt Benoit Madeleine's lives,
As if their life weren't
diffycult enough allready.
And what about our soldier?
Every night I heard him.
Always the same
unfamiliar music.
I was meant to resent him,
though there was relief in his
presence after months of silence.
Dear Gaston, Nadal,
when you will read it...
Run!
Sorry to disturb you.
The dog isn't mine.
We found him in an abandoned village.
At least, he is a Frenchman.
May I?
Your house is beautiful, madam.
It isn't mine.
It's my mother in law's.
The piano is yours, I imagine.
What makes you say that?
I don't believe your mother
in law is a music lover.
My father gave that piano to me.
- Do you play?
- I do.
But madam doen't want
any music in the house
until my husband is
at home to hear it.
You mind if I sit?
The piece you keep playing...
- I don't recognise it.
- You wouldn't.
- I've studied music you know.
- Not this.
You wrote it?
I was a composer, before the war.
When I first got married.
- You're married?
- I have been married four years.
And a soldier four years.
She must miss you.
No, not really.
Not anymore.
Hello.
Come here!
- What are you doing here?
- I thought I left something.
So you come in without asking?
I can't hear you!
I'm sorry.
- Did you look at any of these?
- No.
- No?
- No I promise.
Read one!
Out loud!
To whom it may concern monsieur Blank
is a married father of five children.
For several months
he's had...
sexual relations with a young
woman half his age.
He should be charged with
public indecency.
Monsieur Dubua is selling
food in the black market.
Mr. Renkar is a communist,
a liar and a homosexual,
The refugee at mass
pretends to be a Catholic,
when she really is
a dirty Jew.
What are they?
They are from your neighbors.
They were waiting for us at the
town Hall when we arrived.
They are gossip. Nothing more than
these people settling old scores.
They should be burned!
If I had my way
they would.
My major has ordered me.
It's my job to read them.
You can go.
I don't know why you've married him.
Was it the land?
Your father lost all of his, and he
sent you looking for someone else's.
No, my father was dying.
And wanted to...
find me...a good man!
A rich man!
What have I done?
I see everything that
goes on in this house.
Please, he only asked to go
into the garden.
You should have stood up and left.
Do you expect me to be
confined in my bedroom?
- I expect you to be a faithful wife.
- I am!
Then how can you speak
how can you even breathe
when you know that your husband
is been hunted down
by these animals, when I hit...
rip their eye....
What has happened?
We've just heard that...
Gaston's unit is in
a labor camp in Germany.
Your husband is a prisoner of war.
This German is our enemy!
Do you understand?
Yes.
Madame?
I can not talk to you.
I should have believed you.
I think this is why
you came to my room.
I'm sorry.
Remember you are doing
the rents today Lucille.
Come on, we will be late.
I'm going for swim.
Can you swim?
The handicap doesn't mean
you can't swim with a leg.
Sorry, I didn't mean...
I meant with your
infirmity can you?
- What happened?
- My horse fell.
My leg was trapped.
Otherwise you would have faught?
Right?
Yes.
I would.
Nietzsche said, a man
is made to be a warrior.
Have you read Nietzsche?
He also said:
A woman is made to
please the warrior.
His leg... did it happened
before or after you have married?
After.
Beautiful scent.
Perhaps I could buy a bouquet
for my bedroom.
- Cheer it up a little.
- Madeleine!
You are going to bring
the animals in.
Hey, a vase by my bed.
If that's no trouble?
It's all there madame Anzhelier.
You'll get double that next door now.
I learnt that
when I was young.
My father taught it me.
Her father taught it too.
- Is he...
- He got sepperated from us.
But they'll be joinning us soon.
That's enough practice for today.
Why don't you go
outside and play.
Stay close to the house.
- She is lovely.
- Thank you.
Madam, can I ask you
for a piece of soap, please?
To wash up.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
It's just hard with them
living so close to us.
Fucking.
Fuck you!
Benoit, please.
- Didn't you handed your gun?
- I did, the one that was registered.
- What you think you can ask?
- I need him.
- What will you tell him you are here?
- The German...
In my home... is
chasing after Madeleine.
The officer that lives here
put pressure on him.
- I do not speak to him.
- That's what I've heard.
I'm not here
to criticise you.
I just want him moved.
Please.
You have a complaint about
a German soldier, I apologize.
- So you'll do something?
- I have no influence of him.
We are all of equal rank.
So it's one role for us,
and another for them.
That's not what I said.
We lost the war we don't have
to lose our women as well.
Then perhaps, you should have thought
of protecting them earlier my friend.
Please...
I will try.
- But it might only make it worse.
- Tell him to leave her in peace.
I will not ask again.
Our regiment can
leave at anytime.
I couldn't stand a think...
that you hated me.
I don't hate you.
Then invite me for tea.
It's hardly any left.
- Your men have taken it too.
- A wine?
I will talk to Bonnet.
In return, I only ask that
we'll be descent to one another.
- Where's the harm in that?
- My mother in law will scream.
- Come and rest me.
- She has church tonight.
She'll be another
half an hour.
Just one drink.
How did you become a soldier?
I am from a military family.
It was expected I was.
My brothers and I, signed up
on the same day.
Your brothers?
Where are they?
One was killed in Poland.
Another one in Normandy.
The youngest has just left
for Africa.
People shouldn't be
sucrifised like this.
- I mean none of us.
- I can't think like that.
Questioning only makes
things more difficult.
Do you believe in the war?
Let's say, I believe,
in the communal spirit.
None of us like to admit it
but single actions on the own
don't mean anything.
Why is it that whenever I see you,
you are always on your own.
When do you see me?
Forget all this
for two minutes.
Come on.
Lucille!
Madame is on the way back.
Go into the garden.
Quick.
I 'm supposed to be the one
everybody is afraid of.
But she could easily
scare th plague away.
I just wanted to thank you.
You're very kind.
It's been a long time since
I talked to anyone like this.
I thank you.
Good night.
Lucille! Well, I suppose
you'll tell everyone now?
It's allright for you you,
all I do is work.
If I ddn't have love...
I don't care where he was born.
They are human, just like us. And they
didn't turn my family out of their home.
- You did that.
- That was my mother in law.
- It's not me.
- Open your eyes Lucille...
Our men are not better than them,
some of them are much worse.
Ask your officer,
he knows.
Ask him, what he's read
in those letters.
Ask him, what he's read
about your husband.
You need to know,
everybody else does.
I do not understand
why we behave here.
It does not mind...
Sometimes you have such a holiday.
Thank you.
Actually, what's
wrong with that?
They allow us to feel the power.
We are winners.
Is it so?
Not only that,
but we must feel it.
That's great!
Anything else?
This is the case for you?
Someone complained?
- Don't go near that close.
- Here they all are amoral.
And you know what are
the plans of the Führer.
- What are they?
- Destruction.
They are animals and only
occupy our land.
- Leave her alone.
- And you do not care.
I'm Lieutenant.
How long have you known?
- I don't feel entitled to tell you.
- Lucille!
You knew, didn't you?
That your perfect son
is been having an affair
that was going on
before we even met.
You should see how
many of those are about you.
You always say how much
you want a grandchild.
But you've got one.
Her name is Simon.
You can keep your stupid
little secrets, I couldn't care less.
Can I play you something?
It's very beautiful.
What is it?
I married a man
that I only met twice.
I tried to convince myself
that we were in love.
Not much if I had been dead.
It's not possible.
- Lucille.
- I'm coming.
Madame wants to
see you straightaway.
You remember Madame Perrin?
Yes, of course.
What brings you back from
the freezer, madam?
My son died in Normandy
as the Germans advanced.
I just received permission
to visit his grave.
I am sorry to hear.
- How are things in Lyon?
- Bad.
At least you do not have
a German living in your house.
Yes.
I heard about your officer.
He is friendly!
I won't have anything to do with him,
but Lucille does, don't you?
Oo but that's good.
We had to leave in such a hurry,
that certain things were left behind...
The Germans are using
our house now.
Could you go there
and get them back?
Attention!
Attention!
Why so scattered?
As pigs are.
Is this your house?
Arrange!
So this is what it means to be
protected by the German army?
Lucille.
Wait.
Look at me.
What happens in there,
is indefensible.
I have nothing in common
with these people.
 Lieutenant, as instructed,
everything tidy. What else?
- Gather all in order, I am coming.
- Yes, Lieutenant.
The only person I have
something in common with...
- is you.
- No.
As set of false teeth,
a china dinner service,
household items of
purely sentimental value.
I clawed back what crams
I could from the enemy.
The air was thick with whispers.
Some saw me the collaborator,
others admired my bravery.
But none knew what
I was really filling.
Most of it it's here.
I apologize for any damages.
Well done! At least you 've got
the nerve to stand up this scum.
I think she is going
to visit her sister.
Which will leave us
to ourselves.
Allright.
Come back here!
Benoit Labarie, so you're the one
who's been stealing from us.
- You're a thief.
- What you expect us to do?
- You treat us as we are suff!
- How dare you speak to me like that?
I'll speak to you how I like.
I'm not the only one who
comes here, we all do.
- But it's only going to get worse.
- Get out of here.
Chickens...
Give me my fucking chickens!
You'd better pray your German
friends stay long time,
because the day they'll leave...
I caught him.
It's Labarie.
- I told you to let it lie.
- He still has a gun.
So does half the town
including myself.
He tried to shoot me
with it.
You need to do something.
Where are you going?
In Africa.
- All you taking?
- Who are not slay them.
They even almost no men here.
Why do we care about this?
Not at all.
That's better. Anyway
they will ruin the horses.
- And so will at least serve for something.
- Officer Bonnet!
I'll Have to leave everything to you.
For three months we have
lived alongside eachother.
Now there would be no more
holding back.
Not everyone else fight
eachother, hate eachother.
Just leave us in peace.
I thought you said you were going to
take the horse yourself.
What have you done? Go!
I'll distract them.
Guys, quick now.
Don't move.
I have a warrant for the arrest
of  Benoit Labarie. Where is he?
He is on the field.
You walk toward the field.
The rest search the house.
I don't know what's
wrong with you farmers?
Always station your guns
in the same places.
Come down. You won't be
in the labor camp for long.
If you come back for leniency
likely to be a year.
Plenty of time for me to fuck your wife
while you shovel frozen shit in Buchenwald.
Fuck you!
Stay there!
Don't move!
Where shot?
Here. It rather was here.
The farmer there.
Shoot.
- Madeleine?
- Is madam home?
She is away for the night.
What happened?
- How do you know where he is?
- There is no hunting lodge in the woods.
No one has offered to take him in?
That's why I'm here.
Me let me go,
but they are watching me.
If they are watching...
- You shouldn't have come here.
- Benoit was a good man.
No one else is going to help him.
He can't move very fast.
And they'll hunt him,
and they'll find him,
and when they'll do they will
kill him. Do you know that?
You're the only one that
can help me now, please.
I...
Sorry, I don't...
I thought you said
madam was away.
Your officer will not
 be coming, you know.
I past him in the square.
He is in the search party
for my husband.
Shame on you.
What was I thinking? My friends and
neighbors were hunted like animals,
while I was living
out of fantasy.
A disgraceful madness.
Labarie!
What are you doing here?
The dogs are going after your scent.
Put these, and come with me.
Yesterday, an officer of
the German Wehrmacht,
was killed by one Benoit Labarie,
resident on the Monmare estate
Any person guilty
of providing him with shelter,
aid, or protection,
or who knows of
where he's about,
is required to report this information
to German headquarters
within 48 hours
of this notice.
Or, they will incure
immediate execution...
by firing squad.
Vaughn Falk we must talk.
Viscount, you come too.
Major, I'm sure that
after such a speech,
they will announce him
in the shortest possible time.
We believe that he is a communist,
and it was a well-planned action.
Do you know what will happen
with the mayor for the settlement,
if there is a red infection?
Whether I'll catch him or not,
you are under the knife.
But Major, I 'm the Viscount
you can't...
I have nothing in common
with you.
Mayors are responsible for the
population of their city.
If you do not find him within 48 hours,
we will shoot you.
Take him.
Major! I'm not
guilty, Major!
Major, please...
Major before killing Bonnet,
I talked with him.
And he told me about
your strange behavior.
It was not so
as he guessed it?
No.
Surely not.
Continue the search.
Find him.
This is your chance to be justified.
Do you understand?
I do not want to lose you,
you are a good officer. Come on, go!
Yes sir.
Search there!
How romantic. I 'm get to have
to talk to his commander officer.
No you won't.
- Who knows?
- No one.
- Not even his wife?
- I couldn't risk it.
You should ask me first.
My grandfather put this
here during during the last war.
Get in.
Quickly.
Don't make a sound.
Why are you doing this?
Seeing him dressed in
Gaston's clothes, made me think...
he could be my son.
They are here.
Madam, we are looking
for Benoit Labarie.
Lucille!
Lucille, I couldn't get back.
- No!
- Stop!
Stop...
- We were searching the woods all night.
- I know.
- Lieutenant.
- Yes.
- We are ready to search the house.
- Very good.
Lucille tell me
something's wrong?
We made a mistake.
What is this?
What is this? Is it yours?
Where is your daughter?
- Where is your daughter?
- With her father.
We'll come back for her.
Your feelings changed?
- Yes.
- Why?
Lieutenant, upper
floor is clean.
Wake is been held for officer Bonnett,
but we do not have enough taper linen...
- So, could we borrow some of your's?
- They belonged to my mother.
I trust you will return
it in its original state.
- Of course.
- Take cover.
Anna!
Open it.
Search it.
Hurry up.
Take her.
Don't be afraid of us.
There is still time.
Somebody might
give him up.
- You know Benoit...
- I know, I know.
You did the right thing.
God can see into
our heart.
I love you.
I love you, too.
Take position!
- Amen!
- Amen!
Ready.
Fire!
Free.
I have told myself they are
just like us afterall.
But they were not.
We are different species
irreconcilable.
Enemies forever.
I will not hide
till the war is over.
I'm not afraid
of dying.
- I just want It to be for a reason.
- What can you do?
- I know people, in Paris.
- Who?
People are getting organized.
Fighting back.
You 'll never pass the check points,
they are everywhere.
- What if I take him?
- Lucille you can't do that.
I'm taking you.
What about the travel pass?
Where are you going,
fucking german whore?
He is safe.
What are you doing here?
I need a travel pass.
I have to travel to Paris.
One of our tenants needs
medicin.
His daughter is very ill.
You heard about
the Viscount?
- Yes.
- You must hate me now.
I would, if I were you.
This tenant...
has he come to the house?
- No.
- That's a shame.
My orderly says he could smell
a different man's tobacco.
He thinks you're
hidhing someone.
And you?
If I had, even the
slightest suspicion,
it would be my duty
to react.
I know that.
Let's say, it was mine.
A gift from my wife.
I'll instruct my orderly
to issue the pass.
Thank you.
We'll see eachother again.
Not as a soldier.
You won't even recognize me.
Becareful.
For your life.
This is precious to you?
Yes.
It is precious to me.
Lieutenant, there is an order.
Please.
Can I go?
Yes.
French suite.
This is everything you'll need.
And...
Gaston left us this.
Just in case.
Thank you.
Gaston will come back.
I'm sure of it.
Thank you.
Do you know...
that scent of tobacco.
I'm sure that the house of Labarie
smelled the same way.
More than that,
I intentionally went there.
So, in the most thorough manner
to search the house Anzhelier.
It is possible that there is a
secret room or something.
Very good.
Major, we are ready.
Shall we start?
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.
Where to?
- Where to?
- Paris.
Papers.
Come here.
What to do Gustav.
Let the woman.
Get out of the car.
Out!
Open the trunk.
Open.
Hurry up.
Get down.
Benoit!
Hold on to me.
Help me.
Open it.
Hardly aware if our true feelings
had ever been spoken.
Not a single word about love.
After the war, I heard,
that Bruno had died.
But may be he
just disappeared.
 Like me.
I drove Benoit to a farm house,
and a week later we made it to Paris.
We fought for what
we believe in
and four years later
France was free.
Over time I try to forget
the people I lost.
But the music always
carries me back...
 to him...
"Suite francaise" was written in secret
as the Nazies occupied France.
It was never completed.
In 1942 its author Irene Nemirovski
was arrested, for being Jewish
and died in Auschwitz.
Her handwritten manuscript lay unread
in a suitcase for nearly 60 years
until it was rediscovered
by her daughter.
"Suite Francaise" was finally published in
2004 and became a worldwide bestseller.
"It is an extraordinary feeling to have
brought my mother back to life".
It shows the Nazis did not
trully succed in killing her.
It is not vengeance,
but it is a victory. "
Denise Epsten Duaple.
The daughter of the author.
