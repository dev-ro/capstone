Mr. Gorbachev
tear down this wall!
In November 1989, after 28 years,
the Berlin Wall fell

BERLIN
NOVEMBER 1989
Oh my
- James damn Gascoigne ...
- How did you find me?
"Maybe you're such a good spy."
how much she thinks.
It was Satchel, was not it?
Satchel betrayed me.
I always thought that if I got caught,
it would be for the best
But are not you the best, Bakhtin?
You're the biggest bastard in the entire KGB.
Stones and sticks, Jimmy.

ATOMIC BLONDE
What an ugly black eye.
Where is C.?
Given the recent events in the world,
C. will not join us.
Yes of course.
The recorded voices are as follows,
I, senior director and officer Eric Gray,
our American guest Emmett Kurzfeld,
the CIA,
and returning British operations
Officer Lorraine Broughton.
Before you begin Lord,
I formally request
that Mr. Kurzfeld be removed
the meeting.
Request rejected.
"What I have to tell you,
is not intended for the CIA.
Lorraine, you're the subject of this meeting.
You have no control.
- I get it.
"I was there in Berlin.
I am here with full executive power
of Langley.
If it makes you more comfortable, I can stay
behind the mirror with everyone else
But it's a little crowded there.
Sucks cock
What did you say?
I said nothing.
Sorry, did you say something, Lorraine?
"Did you hear me say anything?"
"I thought you said something."
What she said?
- What?
Good...
Do you want to hear the recording?
Well then,
Let's start?
Berlin.
- What happened?
Yes...
Hm, Berlin ...
Shit.
THE BEGINNING
Ah, Lorraine,
"Sorry for bringing you last minute."
- You know C.
- Yes.
- We were looking at your file.
"Your Russian is excellent."
"You're a specialist in running away."
Proficient in data collection
and hand-to-hand combat.
It is an impressive set of skills
And knowing the reasons I know
Is she going to need all of them?
I think straight to the point
How well do you know James Gascoigne?
Enough to greet you.
We work in Instanbul in 85.
He is dead.
Gascoigne was killed last night
during a mission in Berlin.
The West German police fished
Spree body this morning.
The coroner extracted a
7.8 mm Tokarev bullet
of the skull base.
Soviets.
- Yesterday Gascoigne had a meeting with
a Stasi officer codenamed Spyglass.
We promise Spyglass immunity in
exchange of a document in microfilm,
codename The list.
Hidden in a Swiss watch.
The list contains all the official
active clandestine
all their suspected cases.
It's an atomic bomb full of information
which could extend the Cold War
for another 40 years.
- And we believe that the man who
killed Gascoigne, now he's got it.
Our sources point to Yuri Bakhtin,
a KGB killer with more than a dozen
of confirmed murders.
"So you want me in Moscow?"
- No.
Bakhtin never stepped on the plane.
So he's still in Berlin with the list.
Everyone is hunting her,
the Yankees, the French.
"The Soviets, of course.
"And our man, Percival
"Who is Percival?"
- David Percival.
He's our number one in Berlin.
He is your contact there.
 The store is open! 
 Money is good, information is better. 
 And you? What do you have for me? </I>
Straight from the breast of the Virgin Mary.
EAST BERLIN
A Jordache was not easy.
It's for my wife's birthday.
- This is really cool, but
Where's the fucking list?
I gave the microfilm to Gascoigne
last night.
James did not show up.
I did my part.
I gave the list to him.
You have to cross me and my family,
it is not safer for us here.
The Russians have an eye on me.
No list, no agreement.
- I risked everything.
- No list, no agreement.
Listen to Spyglass well without this list
Why should not I take you outside?
and shoot the shit out of your head?
Are you going to kill a Stasi officer?
One that is about to run away
to the west? Yes.
"Without the embassy taking care of him,
Percival became a little native.
- Totally wild.
"Berlin is the wild west."
When this cursed war begins,
We do not want to be around.
"If the Russians get this list,
we are all in trouble
- On both sides.
You're Elisabeth Loyd.
Lawyer graduated from Cambridge,
sent by the family of James Gascoigne
to recover the body and the possessions of
his late deceased son.
Your mission is to contact
with Percival
and do whatever it takes
to bring the list home.
"And remember, Lorraine,
This is extremely sensitive.
Trust no one.
Follow me!
Come on, come on, come on.
Quick here.
"You told me you made a copy."
I memorized it.
- You remember?
Each of the agents on the list!
All the friends you visit.
The Penny Lane brothel,
His favorite girl is margot
The real name is Maria.
Maria?
- Okay, I'll take you across the border.
"You're a good person, Percival.
Fuck you!
I just want the list. As soon as I...
 curse.
- Stop it!
- I'll get in touch.
- You...
- Good night people.
- Good night and papers.
- Papers ... Oh, you ...
Stop now!
"Did you see him?"
- Faster here!
Get up!
Oh, it's so late.
WEST BERLIN
 Welcome to Tempelhof Airport 
Miss Broughton,
Mr. Percival was late,
he sent me to get it.
- Luggage?
"No, they were sent.
Please follow me.
 Parking for the
terminal is prohibited. 
 Shipment and disembarkation only. 
CENTRAL AIRPORT
"So it's your first time in Berlin?"
- Yes.
Well, it's an extraordinary time.
to be here.
Incredible music,
great nightlife.
Beautiful restaurants.
You must know the Café Central
for a drink.
You'll need it later.
"Do you remember Mr. Bremovych?"
- Of course yes.
- Because he is very curious to know
what he came to do here in Berlin.
"What the hell are you doing?"
What the hell are you doing?
Welcome to Berlin, I'm David.
Where the hell were you?
"Do not shoot, I got your shoe.
I'll help you with your bags.
- Come on.
- For God
- The Russians are so fucking heavy.
Five minutes after landing
and I was discovered.
You were not discovered.
"They knew my name.
- This is worrying.
- And yours.
- Hardly surprising.
What an excellent start, Percival.
So what was your first impression?
From David?
He was handsome, over 30,
hair disaster Sinéad O'Connor.
Irish singer.
I asked him which
the business, and he told me.
It's mixing.
Do you want to feel?
You must blend in the east.
By the way, he was stuck at the gate.
I mean, how the hell,
the bosses think you can
help me find this list?
Once you recover
the Gascoigne body,
Your visa is void and you
back on the first plane.
- I will find out.
- This is Checkpoint Charlie.
My office is back there.
- I'm not here to collect
Postcards, Percival.
Just take me to my hotel,
in the corner.
I thought you said never
to have come to Berlin.
I can read a damn map!
This will only take a minute.
SOVIET COMMERCE MISSION
What are you doing?
Sending a message
for a fascist pig.
Send my regards to Comrade Bremovych.
BACK TO THE EAST
 So what do we have here? 
 Mr. Bremovych, 
 we arrest them doing
party last night. 
 - The future of West Germany. 
 You. 
 Get up.
Get up, I said! </I>
 Come here. 
 So you want to have fun, right? 
 Let's have fun. 
 What we have here. 
Come on, dance for me.
 The song is playing, right? 
 Give him a round of applause! 
 There was a man here last night ... 
a traitor
 Tell me where he is! 
 Where is Bakhtin? 
 Where is the list? 
 He never showed up,
Comrade Bremovych. </I>
 Capitalist bastard,
it will sell the list. 
 Find it! I want this list. </I>
 - Boris, give me that picture. 
Pay attention! 
 This man is a traitor. 
 Do you know him? 
 Tension is high in East Berlin 
 while civil disobedience
continues to increase. 
 These youth leaders in Berlin protest
through tear gas and water pistols 
 And there are countless
police reports 
 attacking peaceful demonstrators
with batons. 
I was sent to arrange the
return of a British citizen.
- The body is identified
by his attache.
"Yes, I believe that, too."
This was not a question,
was a statement
Was he your colleague?
Different departments.
Which department?
 - A different one.
Do you have the transfer papers?
You know the movies in which
images start to get slower
and melt ...
And then they catch fire?
Good...
this is Berlin.
- The passport number is not correct.
I will not release this body
without the correct information.
It's a simple mistake.
Miss Loyd, we're in Germany.
we do not make simple mistakes.
I will not lie. I'm impressed.
You have a lot of balls
to invade here.
You should see my balls and stay
truly impressed.
I'll take your word for it.
I see you've figured out a way to stay,
You write 16 miniatures at 76.
That's right.
 I'm not going anywhere.
I stay here for at least another week.
- Lucky me.
They will not release the body now, not until
investigate the whole bureaucratic nightmare
How the hell did you get in here?
You know, I'm in Berlin for a long time.
and I believe, that I know every doorman
each decent bathroom
on both sides of the wall.
So you know Spyglass.
I never talked to the guy.
He heard about James.
What do you know about the woman who
Follow me from Tempelhof.
I'd say you're a
attractive woman and ...
and should imagine the rest.
If I followed you, I mean,
how it should be,
You'd never know.
It's a piece of art, right?
Just like walking, playing or bagpipes ...
You can do it or you can not.
Your party.
I would like to buy a watch.
I need access to
a network in East Berlin.
Come back tomorrow before we close.
East Berlin is with short wick
tonight
while members of the Communist Party
have trouble maintaining order.
How well do you know James Gascoigne?
He is dead.
 The coroner has found
Tokarev 7.62 mm bullet 
 at the base of the skull. 
Soviets
We know who Satchel is.
We have to get away.
You hoped to find the list
in the Gascoigne apartment.
Did you realize that I was
late for the party
The Russians before anyone
they should have ransacked the place.
- Yes.
But the list was not our only problem.
Before I leave,
he told me one more thing.
That's why I did not want the CIA
was present.
Spyglass revealed that this list
would unmask a dual agent
called Satchel.
- I want Satchel, dead or alive.
This traitor has been a thorn
on our side for years.
He is a point of shame
to the Crown.
And the biggest point of leaked information
in the history of MI6.
You're going to expose that bastard, Satchel.
And we'll hang you for treason.
Who knows, you find yourself drinking
tea at Buckingham Palace.
- Then no.
I did not just look for the list
in the Gascoigne apartment.
-  Go ahead, bring it back. 
-  Action! 
Percival and I apparently had one
different definition of cooperation.
- ... on third floor.
"Climb up the stairs quickly!"
- What do you mean by that?
He was the only one who knew that I had gone
to the apartment of Gascoigne.
If I had known he would call the police,
I would have worn a different outfit.
Different clothes ...
 Fast. I heard something. </I>
- Hey! Stop it!
 With repeated calls for change
on the streets 
 and the protesters every time
more confident 
 Time is running out for
Government of East Germany. </I>
 Public opinion is that the communist party 
 can not maintain leadership
for much longer 
 And if there is no change soon 
 today's calm protest 
 can be seen as the
calm before the storm. 
 It is not only by new faces that
they ask 
 but perhaps the complete demolition of the wall. 
May I take your coat?
Make yourself at home.
Holy shit ...
"You want Gin?"
- Feel free.
His library includes Larry Flint.
Freedom Champion
of expression.
What did you think about Bakhtin?
If Bakhtin wanted the Russians
get the list
he would have delivered it.
We just have to wait.
until it comes into play.
I can not wait.
This is your city, Percival.
You only know janitors and toilets.
And what you found
in the Gascoigne apartment?
What the German brand.
Passports in white, travel visa,
and a picture of you two together,
some years ago.
I did not mention that we were friends.
- No.
- No?
"I must have forgotten to say
OK dear.
I'm going for a walk.
Look, we are all
exposed by this list.
Save the world is cool and everything,
but my main goal is
keep me alive.
I'm now ten years old.
the location of Berlin.
You know that I'm the only one here
which can help you get that list.
Yes, I read your file.
I also read your DOG file.
So, let's cut the crap?
This hangover game,
I do not know what is up or down,
I'm not buying it.
I trust you so far.
as far as I can throw you.
"It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver."
Niccolò Machiavelli.
It's on your bookshelf.
-Oh my God. I think I love you.
- It is a pity.
If Percival was telling the truth
about Bakhtin,
I had to find out what the Russians knew.
Stoney with ice.
 Good evening, miss. 
"I'm not speaking German tonight.
So you're British.
 Did you expect me to be Swedish? 
Very impressive.
"This can not be your only talent.
Talents are sometimes overrated.
But devotion and loyalty are
very rare nowadays.
Everyone here is looking for something.
- What are you looking for?
All well considered,
you would not say that deep down we are
looking for the same things?
I leave you alone for a moment.
 and you start attracting admirers?
Sir, three are not always too many.
But tonight, it is.
French women
What about the British?
Maybe we can come to an agreement?
We have not seen each other for a long time,
and we really have to talk about it.
Alone.
Ladies, Berlin is a small place.
I'm sure we'll meet
again.
Excuse me.
It seemed like you needed to be saved.
I appreciate the gesture, miss.
Lasalle ...
Delphine Lasalle.
Nice to meet you.
And what do you do, Delphine?
I am part-time interpreter,
who really wants to be a poet
 or maybe a rock star.
My friend has a club nearby.
You want to meet?
Now?
- Of course.
I can not.
"Well, I'll give you the address anyway.
Then we'll see you there tomorrow night.
You will come?
Perhaps?
You are ruthless.
- Yes.
David Hasselhof is in town.
- Lucky us!
Berlin is really doomed.
Your watch is ready.
He is at the desk
on the blank envelope.
I believe you will find my
very helpful contact.
-  Your watch is ready. 
 He is at the counter.
on the blank envelope. 
 I believe you will find my
very helpful contact. 
 East Berliners invaded
Embassies of West Germany 
 in Czechoslovakia
earlier this week, 
 now the Czech government
began to pass refugees 
 without many questions for
control points. 
 You have to ask how long
the government of East Berlin 
 can stand the tide of workers
which continue to come out. 
Bakhtin and the list had not yet
appeared in the west.
I had to talk to my new contact
and find out what I was up against
in the east.
You should have requested a
visitor card.
- What kind of job do you do?
- Legal Affairs.
If you do not return before 6 am,
You will be arrested.
Did you understand that?
I get it.
Right now I'm not much.
convinced of its history.
- Why did not you use the contacts
of Percival in the east?
- You told me...
to trust no one.
 - Hello. 
 I'm not sure, but
I believe it to be her. </I>
 She's on her way to Alexanderplatz. 
Bring it to me.
 You're coming with me. 
 Are you crazy? 
 He just wants to talk. 
- Come on, on the side!
You're late.
And it is being followed.
I'm late because I was followed.
I missed them 20 minutes ago
near the Platz of Republik.
You're as good as your reputation.
Are you sure this is the best
to meet us
Keep your enemy close.
I'm an effort now
for them.
The Watchmaker said that there is a lot of
black market interest
on this list in the last few days.
"Any sign of Bakhtin?"
- No.
This figure of Satchel leaves people
on both sides of the wall worried.
Yes.
What network did you gather?
There are many dissatisfied young
on this side of the wall.
They are like ...
new books.
If you find the right spark ...
Continues.
I want to sell a watch.
What do you have for sale?
It is extremely valuable,
the highest quality and ...
full of secrets.
Would you mind if I inspected
the merchandise?
Of course I would mind.
Tell only potential buyers,
Bakhtin is open to business.
-  Ladies, Berlin is a small place. 
 - I'm sure we'll meet
again 
 Sorry. 
 It seemed like you needed to be saved. 
 My friend has a club nearby.

 Do you want to meet? 
I did not think you'd come.
Stoney with ice.
You're paying attention.
I seek pleasure in the details.
Now that we're talking about it ...
I really want to ask you something.
Let's find a quiet place.
Why the gun, Delphine?
You're not so well disguised.
How much do you think?
I know who you are.
You are Lorraine Broughton, MI6.
And you're here because of the
 death of Gascoigne.
What do you know about Gascoigne?
Anything.
When someone is killing
allied officers
Should not we all care?
Whatever you have on this list ...
people are willing to kill for it.
- It's my first job.
of the French secret service.
I'm only here for a year.
- I'm scared, okay?
I went into it because it was exciting,
but this was never the case in Berlin.
You should have become a poet.
Or a rock star.
So you made contact
with a French agent.
- Of course.
- Because?
I thought they would have information
which I could explore.
Nothing else.
"And she had?"
Did she have information, Lorraine?
"I need to tell you something."
It has to do with your friend, Percival.
Lorraine ...
Did she have information, Lorraine?
Did she give you information?
She did not give me anything.
David Percival!
- Are you following me?
"Maybe you're not such a good spy."
as she thinks.
That was for James, you fucking bastard.
And now give me that damn list.
We had to send a message, Lorraine.
-For several days on a mission without a
single track
and with many distractions.
- You had to be reminded of what was
in Game.
Oh I got your message.
- What vision!
110 km of barbed wire,
310 guard dogs, 65 anti-vehicle trenches,
40,000 trained Soviets,
heavily armed borders.
All this
and still five thousand Citizens of the GDR
they had the courage to escape.
You left MI6 so worried
that they called the CIA to put
Judgment on you.
Eric Gray called me.
Of course.
I do not have to remind you.
How fast does time go by?
When this list is made public,
a lot of good working people,
brave men and women,
will appear dead.
Including you and me.
I swear to you that in the last weeks
I'm afraid to wake up every morning.
I understand the gravity of the situation, sir.
and the pressure of time.
See, I did not come up here just to give you
a vibrant speech.
So I get right to the point.
Last night you met a woman.
- Delphine Lasalle is in debt
Given the weather, I'd hate to see an order
businesswoman
which is not in their interest.
Of her disinterest?
What do you mean, her disinterest?
Do not offend my intellect Lorraine
You know exactly what I mean.
I hope you can get a picture.
Next week, it could be a photo
totally different.
 This call can change your life! 
 - Satchel was compromised. 
 PERSONAL PROFILE 
 SATCHEL
Double Agent 
-  Come to the Rough Trade Bar, Oranienstrasse. 
 - We need to talk. 
"Look at all those lovers of life.
Just a beautiful woman who
went wrong. Great!
Yuri Bakhtin emerged again.
The police found him with a
hole in the skull.
In any case, we have
that deal with Spyglass.
Come to think of it, he has little time there.
- Our priority is with the list.
"We must not make mistakes.
- Come on. say it!
He is not the most trustworthy person.
that I have met or the most intelligent.
Wait, you said you did not know him.
I lied.
He says he memorized the whole list.
He's ready to make the leap.
"He believed he had recorded the thing
all in memory?
All.
If I had known this before,
I would have prioritized Spyglass.
His knowledge made him
as valuable as the list.
I could grab it any second.
but Percival kept it a secret,
putting us in a delicate situation.
The KGB will have some very brave bastards.
out there looking for Spyglass
we can not trust any of the
paths or methods.
- It is not so difficult to cross
frontier today.
It is if you are as wanted as Spyglass.
We need to cross the border
in full view
with him personally
to ensure their safety.
- Or use tomorrow's rally.
This is crazy.
- All those demonstrators will be a
great distraction.
Spyglass is my face, we're going
do it my way.
OK.
But we used my contact to put
the papers in order.
Right.
We have a deal?
I consider that to be the case.
You know...
I got a call from David Percival.
That night, Lorraine.
He said he had the list.
 - I had little time
to finish. 
"And he knew Satchel's identity.
Oh, I'm very close to Satchel.
And no one thought to tell me?
Shit!
You brought a lot of friends.
"I heard that Bakhtin had
a small accident.
I heard he slipped and
fell on a stick of ice.
"Berlin is a cruel teacher.
"Especially for traitors like Bakhtin."
Do not be such a damn Communist.
You have a problem.
- Yes I know.
"You have the bloody list."
We've been in the trench long enough.
to know that in
in times like these, Berlin has
their own rules.
Can I give you information
which will maintain the balance.
So, are you in or out?
Percival is trying to arm me.
Are you surprised?
Not really.
These relationships are not real.
 They just means to an end.
When you tell the truth, it's different.
Your eyes change.
Thank you for the warning.
- What do you mean?
"I'd better not do it again."
Because?
Because it will be my death someday.
NO ENTRY
EAST
Well, I'm impressed.
Marco here was just
a good bartender.
You smell like a Stasi officer.
Scratch your mustache.
Use soap and perfume.
They are from the west
You can not bring anything from the east.
Marco will give you clothes.
This is Mr. Spyglass.
 Bremovych says
that the traitor is in that building. 
 Stay alert. 
That should have been easy.
The plan was good.
What went wrong happened
because someone wanted to.
Someone inside.
"You were betrayed by a colleague."
"You mean Satchel.
Would not that be unprecedented?
Upon your request.
"You will not need it."
It only gets worse
if they meet you.
Is everything better prepared?
Yes, everything you asked for.
- I'm ready.
What do you think of your shirt?
I would not want to die in it.
But for him it's perfect.
Come here.
"Now look like a free man.
-  Youth leaders in East Berlin
organized this week 
 A protest at Alexanderplatz. 
He told you that I memorized the list
all in my head?
Yes.
I realize that for some
people can have little value
Some people want me.
even dead, but ...
What choice do I have?
"You have no use for me dead.
And ... I've never lost a package.
I know that.
- It's his family.
That was not part of the plan.
Part of mine.
- Please.
"I'll take your wife and son,
You only care about Spyglass.
I do not know if I have enough passports.
Percival.
Your golden boy.
 You should listen to your mother. 
 Be a brave girl. 
 - I love you. 
We have to go.
See you in the west.
Good luck.
 They are leaving the building now. 
 WE REQUIRE FREE ELECTIONS 
 40 meters and is approaching. 
 I can see them. 
 What's happening? 
 I lost them! 
This was not part of the plan.
It was part of mine.
 Are the umbrellas,
I can not see anything. 
 I do not either. 
 Who can see them? Report! </I>
 There are too many people. 
 I can shoot. 
 Has the target been reached? 
 No visual, we need to move. 
Stay down.
Here inside.
We have to solve this now.
Otherwise, we will never cross the border.
- I do not wanna die
- You're not going to die.
Stay here.
 Call on the radio! 
 I'm trying! 
 Fast! 
 She's here. Quick! </I>
Shit.
- Two more.
 Wait! 
 Do not shoot! 
Go!
You need to stop this bleeding.
Look for anything,
alcohol, rags.
 Take this, bitch! 
Am I your whore now?
 Stop, what are you doing here? 
 One moment, please. 
 Hands behind your head! 
 On the ground! 
 Now! 
In between.
In between!
You need to do something about your German.
It's terrible.
You fucking bitch!
Put on your seat belt.
Are you alright?
Yes.
We fear that ...
- It's so cold!
- Open your door!
- My foot ... is trapped!
- I can not move.
Just breathe.
... my leg.
"You want to take a break?"
- No.
So...
Yes, I believe I understand everything.
You made your plan.
You failed
in bringing a valuable asset from the west.
You sent me to a
damn wasps nest
I was discovered by the KGB
the moment I stepped on the ground.
Maybe even before.
But you did not know that.
You had doubts about Percival.
And you used me to grab it.
Ready when you are.
It's me, it's me.
- He is dead.
Spyglass is dead.
"And you live."
You're not understanding me.
They knew.
"The KGB knew everything.
I have to cross the border.
- Jan.
 I need the car. 
 Good morning, ambassador. 
 Thank you. 
 - My condolences. 
I expected more from the British
than a real fiasco.
I know. Sorry.
Do not wait. You do not have your own
Stasi agent, is not it?
Not one with a photographic memory.
We should see Broughton.
Let's agree.
We need that list.
Now, more than never.
Broughton.
She managed to escape.
Oh really?
Do you know
A beautiful Italian girl said
for me once, David
You can not let go of what was screwed.
Women are always on the road to
progress, is not it?
 What nobody in Germany believed
be possible happened tonight. 
 The wall is falling.
The wall fell. </I>
 We have lived here with the wall since 1961, and ... 
 and I think it's time to take down
the wall, you know. 
 The wall is crumbling. 
 The hammer hits the hands of men who
they were born with him, they overthrow him. 
 From him, Eastern soldiers try
for the wave </I>
 water guns were used, but
the West Berliners are determined. </I>
 In the west, Berliners use
jets of champagne. 
 If I followed you, I mean,
as it should be, 
 You would never know. 
 It is the moment that Berliners
have waited 28 years. </I>
 Even the East Germans
they look animated. 
 A symbolic crack in the structure
which cost hundreds of lives 
 and separated friends, families and couples
for decades. 
I found a French UHF device on the
my coat after Spyglass's death.
I believe now that it was Percival
who installed it
and made it look like it was Lasalle.
Why are you here?
You need to get out of Berlin.
"When I did not hear anything about you,
I was worried.
How naive can you be?
"We chose this life, Delphine.
It just ends in a way.
What are you talking about?
- He betrayed us.
You have to leave while you can.
 - Yes. 
Do not underestimate me, Percival.
-  Lasalle, listen to me carefully. 
-  You have no idea with
who is dealing. 
 - You set me up. 
You...
Come on, this is the game.
 - I know your secrets, David. 
-  And I can play this game
better than you think. 
-  Percival is tempted
arm for me. 
 - Are you surprised? 
Not really.
 These relationships are not real. 
 They are only means to an end. 
-  When you tell the truth,
It's different. 
 - Your eyes change. 
 Thanks for the warning. 
 - What do you mean?
"I'd better not do it again."
 Why? 
-  Because it will be my death someday. 
 - I need to tell you something. 
 -It's about your friend, Percival. 
-  He ... 
 - Ssh. 
- Sorry dear.
This is how it is.
Shit!
 Celebrations continue on the streets
tonight. 
 At the moment the first wave of
East Germans crossed to Berlin 
 they were bathed in champagne and
applauded by a crowd of thousands. 
 It's clear. This will be one of the
most dramatic days in Berlin. </I>
 East Berliners are surprised
when crossing the border 
 which was closed for 28 years. 
 West Berliners are changing
the wall that marked his city and climbing it. 
 No more police interference 
 Unified, Berliners make the
symbol of peace </I>
 Millions look to the east
singing, "down the wall". 
There's just one more question ...
Who won?
And what was the damn game?
after all?
 I thought the wall
would never fall. 
The German peaceful revolution
Let's take a little break, and we'll be back.
and talk in detail about the controversy
musical of the year, "sampling"
Is it art or is it just a plagiarism?
Stay with us.
To win...
you need to know first
Which side are you on
In our line of work ...
That's right, darling, there were black holes.
or exists or does not exist.
You are doing the fair and
so you wake up one day
and realize that you were only
a helper of the devil.
 - Ironic. 
 News reports will not say
there will be more secrets. 
 But we both know
This is not true. 
 The world is commanded in secrets. 
 Whoever has this list has power. 
 And without that, you're just
another fucking target. 
 So, what I learned,
after all? 
 After all the sleepless nights.

 Lying to friends,
lovers, myself. 
 Play this miserable game
in this miserable city 
 full of traitors
and four-faced liars. 
 I'll tell you what I learned,
just one thing. 
I love Berlin, damn it!
You did not have to kill her.
- Suddenly you decided
develop an awareness
After everything you've done?
Did you notice that everyone
who you are approaching
they end up dead?
"You gave Bremovych the details of the plan.
You wanted the KGB to catch me.
- Yes.
You were too cowardly to do it yourself.
Smart, actually.
If those KGB shit had
made apart from them
I would be on my way to a
masturbation with the Queen.
- I read that list.
Lorraine.
Actually, you were a girl.
very disobedient.
Spyglass was a risk
for all of us.
I could not risk leaving him with you.
Where's the list, David?
I do not have it.
He's on his way to MI6,
where it belongs.
"Are you going to lie to the end?"
Truth and lies ...
people like us do not know the difference.
Oh, we know the difference, David.
We chose to ignore it.
Is not that right, Comrade Satchel?
So, this is how it works for you?
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver. 
Well played.
Did you kill David Percival?
The papers are in order for the
bodies of James Gascoigne and David Percival.
You killed the head of our office,
an officer of the Crown.
You'd better have a valid proof
or a good statement.
"Who are you to judge my actions?"
- I'm your superior.
My superior ...
This was never about stopping the war.
It was about saving her ass.
You could not bear the shame
of sins committed in the Cold War.
And I was stupid enough
to give my life for it.
- Yes well...
- This is your job, right?
I did my job.
Despite their efforts
and incompetence
I succeeded where you failed.
I unmasked your traitor, Satchel.
I gave him the only justice he deserved.
A bullet.
Percival with Bremovych. On the day
Spyglass was killed.
-  Maybe we can do some
kind of agreement. 
 You must know that I'm the only one in this
city that can help you have the list. 
 Very impressive. 
 Dedication and fidelity
are rare things nowadays. 
It is a double pleasure to deceive the deceiver. 
 Do we have an agreement? 
 What about the British? 
 - Do you trust Gray?
- No. 
- What about C.?
 C. is an arrogant puppy that
does not leave the desk. 
Percival was Satchel.
Where's the list?
Where's the list, Lorraine?
I do not know.
Ah, balls!
The prime minister will pass
Bad bits of it.
We chose to bury this Broughton
"Your mission never occurred.
- This conversation...
never happened.
"You immediately leave on leave.
- Let's start the next decade, easy.
- W.
- What should I use?
In my tea with the Queen?
THREE DAYS LATER
PARIS
 Comrade Satchel. 
 Comrade Bremovych 
 The list! 
 Good girl. 
 Can I? 
 Tonight, we celebrate. 
 Seriously? 
 For a moment, I thought that you
wanted to kill me. 
 Percival told me who you are. 
Be professional ...
stand on the plastic.
- You really thought that I would
would you give the list?
Before I die, I want you to
Put this on your primitive hard head.
I've never worked for you.
You worked for me.
Every false information I gave you
was a feature on the Iron Curtain.
All the information you gave me
It was a bullet in my fucking gun.
- I want my life back.
Good trip.
-  Estimated flight time for
Langley, 11 hours and 37 minutes. </I>
 - Ready for departure. 
- Let's go home...
It sounds good.
Let's go home.
Sucks cock
- Oh really?
Glad to have been convincing.
