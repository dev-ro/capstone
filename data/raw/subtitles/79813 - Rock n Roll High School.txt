              Thank you, Johnny.
              There she is, Tom.
I had somebody else in mind.    
      Oh, Tom, my files indicate
      she's perfect for you.    
I know, I know,                 
but I was kinda hopin'          
That you'd set me up            
with Riff Randell.              
                Riff Randell?   
        How about a cheerleader?
        Nice set of pompoms.    
No! The only girl I ever        
dream about at night is Riff,   
But I always keep waking up     
just before the good part.      
        Well, how are you set   
        for large amounts       
        of hard cash?           
 (snaps fingers)                
 I have a major credit card.    
                Uh, Norma, dear?
      Yes, Mr. Eaglebauer.      
              Yes, would you    
              draw up a contract
              for Tom Roberts   
              And Riff Randell?

What's that thing               
in your ear, Randell?           
                Um, it's a...   
      A hearing aid.            
    Be careful, Miss Steroid.   
          She's very sensitive  
          about it.             
Oh, I'm sorry                   
to hear that, Randell.          
                        What?   
Sorry to hear that,             
Randell!                        
              Fine. How are you?
Oh, I'm fine, thank you!        
         Oh, I'd say            
         about a quarter to two.
         Come on, Riff,         
         let's go.              
        But I just had lunch.   
        So young.               
                      (giggles) 
That was close.

        Ok, now come on down.   
        I'm stuck.              
          Nonsense.             
          There's nothing to it.

  You're ok, Rambeau.

Go and monitor                  
the halls.                      
     Since assuming office      
     this morning,              
     I've noticed a number      
     of peculiar incidents      
      Among the members         
      of the student body,      
    All having to do            
    with rock-'n'-roll music.   
    Miss Togar, I have          
    no particular love          
    for rock-'n'-roll,          
But it doesn't seem to me       
that listening to it            
         Actually hurts         
         the students.          
             (laughs) but that's
             where you're wrong,
             Mr. Mcgree.        
    Recently,                   
    I have been doing a study   
         Of mice subjected      
         to rock-'n'-roll music.
     Here we have a picture     
     of this mouse,             
  A typical member              
  of the genus rattus rodenti,  
     As he appeared             
     before the start           
     of my investigation -      
      Clean, good-natured,      
  Content to scamper playfully  
  about his cage.               
      This is a picture         
      of the same mouse...      
One week after the introduction 
of rock-'n'-roll music.         
I never dreamed.                
                 Oh, the results
                 were dramatic. 
            He lost all interest
                  In keeping    
                  his cage tidy.
        How scientific.         
             He played          
             his electric guitar
             far into the night,
             Keeping the other  
             test animals awake.
He did?                         
              And he met        
              this female mouse,
      And they have been sharing
      a cage together           
                 Out of wedlock.
That's fascinating,             
Miss Togar.                     
                     Yes, it is.
         Is she crazy?          
She's a principal.              
            Monitor the hall,   
            monitor the hall.   
         I am sick              
         of monitoring the hall.
        Yep.                    
                Let's go monitor
                the freshman.   
        Good idea.

          Spread 'em.           
All right, what the hell        
do you think you're doing       
out here?                       
I was just getting

     Listen,                    
     you have a hall pass?      
Well, no.                       
      (both) no hall pass?      
            Hit him, hit him.   
Guys, I'm allergic to violence. 
I break out in blood.           
                 Hit him anyway.
     Calm down.                 
     Let me see some id.        
     I haven't got all day.     
I need it

        The sock hop.           
        Who'd dance with you?   
    All you have is a buck?     
                 I'll have that.
         Is this you?           
Well, I take                    
a bad picture.                  
    Tell me about it.           
             (both) ugh.        
Listen, I'm gonna give you      
a demerit.                      
What's a demerit?               
     If you get enough of 'em,  
     you wind up in Miss Togar's
     office.

            Hit him now.

it's calisthenics.              
     Where are their books?     
      This is a gym class.      
    They're exercising          
    their bodies.               
                         1, 2...

              All right, girls.

         (all) whoo!            
               (blowing weakly) 
        Uh, Cheryl, do you think
        Tom Roberts is cute?    
Yeah,                           
but he's such a dork.           
            No, he's not.       
            I think he's a fox. 
                          A fox?
Tom Roberts is so boring,       
his brother is an only child.   
            He's not half as hot
            as Joey Ramone.     
Who's Joey Ramone?              
        Where have you been -   
        Mars?                   
      Earth calling Kate.       
     He just happens            
     to be the lead singer      
     of the Ramones.            
          I wish we could       
          see them this Thursday
          at their concert.     
    So what's stopping you?     
We can't cut classes            
to stand in line                
for tickets.                    
                That's right.   
         Oh, please.            
      Ten years from now,       
      no one will care          
If you've ever been             
to high school, much less       
skipped a few classes.          
You all act                     
as if everything's              
so important around here.       
      Just because Togar        
      is stuck in the '50s      
    Doesn't mean                
    there isn't life            
    after high school.          
     I've got my own future     
     to think about.            
    I know I can write          
    for the Ramones.            
    All I've gotta do           
    is get my songs to them.    
     They won't be in town      
     for another year,          
         So I've got to         
         see them now.          
Hey, we wanna go                
as much as you,                 
But we can't all                
cut classes.                    
      Well, I guess             
      it's up to me, then,      
      But you'll have to        
      cover for me, Kate.       
    I'm gonna take              
    a three-day leave           
    from Camp Lombardi          
     And be first in line.      
If anyone wants to join me      
at front-row center,            
Why, you just let me know.      
 (girl) ok.                     
                 (girl #2) yeah.

                     Come on in.
Hello, Mr. Eaglebauer.          
              How are you doing?
Great, thank you.               
            Please, sit down,   
            sit down.           
                  What can I do 
                  for you, Kate?
Well, I wanna go out            
on a date.                      
          Say no more.          
          Eaglebauer enterprises
          has a man for you.    
      Tell me, have you had     
      much experience with boys?
Well... Once I played nurse     
with a boy next door            
And got sued                    
for malpractice.                
I wish part of Riff             
would rub off on me.            
Everything's so easy for her.   
    Did you have                
    any one particular person   
    in mind?                    
Well, I was kind of hoping      
That you might fix me up        
with...                         
With Tom Roberts.               
                    Tom Roberts?
        Yeah.                   
            I love him.         
            He's a great guy.   
            I love him.         
Well, can you do it?            
This will never work.           
Tom will never like me.         
I don't know who I'm kidding.   
What possible reason            
could there be                  
To put myself                   
through all this?               
  Sex.                          
I must admit,                   
as far as reasons go,           
It must be one of the best.     
Kate, I've known Tom            
ever since he was a freshman,   
            When I sold him     
            his first touchdown.
Believe me, you're just         
the type of girl he goes for.   
       (%% "did we meet

How's my would-be Romeo?        
         Eaglebauer, what are we
         doing up here?         
         I thought we were gonna
         start training today.  
This is the perfect spot        
for it.                         
Most romantic setting           
in the city.                    
Just you, the skyline           
and your training partner.      
            Training partner?   
            Hi, Tom.            
         I was kind of expecting
         Riff Randell.          
Eaglebauer, I don't know        
whether I can go through        
with this.                      
Couldn't I just practice        
with myself?                    
    You done too much of that   
    already.                    
 Yeah.                          
 Now, for the next three days,  
     You two are gonna have     
     nothing but fun.           
    Now, the first lesson -     
    necking.                    
The place - lovers' Lane.       
      (turns on tape deck/      
      crickets chirping)        
          The reason -          
      Well, you're young.       
  Now, what's the first thing   
  you guys do?                  
      Aw, no, no, no, no.       
                     (yawns)    
                     (yawns)    
    Now, this next step         
    can either make or break    
    a successful date.          
      One-handed approach       
      to strap unfastening      
     Is a basic skill           
     that must be mastered.     
    Now watch closely           
    as I demonstrate.           
    There's the hook.           
         The snap.              
There is the double hook.       
     There is                   
     the dreaded minihooks.     
    And, if you play            
    your cards right,           
 The easy-open frontal assault. 
      Isn't it sad when a family
      has to suffer so much?    
Isn't it.                       
         (buzzes)               
      Good morning, Joey.       
        Excuse me,              
        but I think it's obvious
         I'm first in line.     
Not anymore.                    
             Hey, look,         
             I been waiting here
             for two days.      
             I'm first in line. 
So you wanna be                 
ahead of me, huh?               
         I don't wanna be. I am.
Apparently you don't know       
who I am.                       
                         No.    
I'm Angel.                      
Angel dust, the Ramones'        
number one fan?                 
I followed 'em                  
on every stop of their tour     
from Cleveland to Pittsburgh    
To Tucson to Charlotte...       
          Ohh, you're a groupie.
            Yeah, well, I happen
            to be a songwriter--
Honey, you're not               
a songwriter,                   
You're a cheerleader.           
             I am first in line.
I'm first in line.              
             I'm first in line. 
Hey, what do you think          
I am - filth?                   
You think I'm just spit         
on the sidewalk for you         
to walk on,                     
Scum under your feet?           
      I don't know what you are,
      but I am first in line.   
I am first in line.             
             I am first in line.
I'm first in line,              
and if you don't like it,       
You can put it                  
where the monkey puts the nuts. 
               (mouths/writing) 
By the way,                     
who do you like?                
              Oh, I think Joey's
              kinda cute.

      These things always happen
      in threes.                
Oh, really?                     
    I want 100 of your best     
    Ramone tickets, please.     
                         $1,000.

      Here they are -           
      the Ramones tickets.      
There's many more of them.      
You'll get one.                 
There you go.                   
All right,                      
I know you want one, too.       
                 What's all     
                 this commotion?
     There you go.              
        Excuse me.              
        What's going on here?   
Here you go.                    
I'm giving out tickets          
to the concert.                 
                    The concert?
Yeah.                           
    I had no idea the students  
    were so interested in music.
Wanna go?                       
Complimentary ticket?           
                Why, thank you. 
                I love concerts.
                But, uh, who are
                the "Ramoneys"? 
      (freshman wheezing)       
 The Ramones.                   
They're the best group          
in the world...                 
          ...Oxygen.            
    So, three members           
    of your family are dead?    
     Oh, we know for a fact     
     that you are lying.        
Go and show her the proof.      
      What do you have          
      to say for yourself?      
                Hey, got better.
      Got better nothing.       
I suppose that her parents      
are still alive, too.           
        Should I check on it,   
        ma'am?                  
         No talking.            
  Kate, I am really surprised   
  at you.                       
  I thought                     
  you would serve as a model    
  for the rest of the school,   
      Not as an accomplice      
      to delinquency.           
Well, she's my friend.          
  A friend that will lead you

    against me..."              
                     (gasps)    
Miss Randell, just what is      
your problem?                   
                     (gulps)    
All right, who else has tickets 
to this concert?                
                    Uh, just us.
            We're the only ones.
     Miss Togar, perhaps we're  
     taking this a bit too far. 
    After all, the concert is on
    their own time, and it's--  
Nonsense! They should           
be made an example              
for the whole school.           
All right,                      
give me your tickets.           
I will give them to Charity.    
                         No way!
    Very well.                  
I'll have my hall monitors      
take them from you.             
       (both) body search!      
Hey, Riff,

          thanks for the ticket.
        Yeah, we couldn't       
        have gone without you,  
         And everybody's        
         gonna be there.

Hey, and whatever you do,       
don't worry.                    
Since Riff lost her tickets     
to the concert,                 
You can move right in.          
She'll be a pushover.           
Besides, look how far           
you've come in three days.      
    Yeah, but the question is   
    how far will she go tonight?

Look at your math book.         
It looks brand new.             
I bet you've never              
even opened it.                 
        I only use it

Yeah, I've gotta                
get home, anyway.               
I'm expecting Tom               
to call me tonight.             
            You really like him,
            don't you?          
Mm-hmm. I've been seeing

                    You have?   
 Mm-hmm.                        
Eaglebauer says we were made    
for one another.                
                     Oh, he did?
I think tonight                 
could be pretty special.        
 (phone rings)                  
                          Hello.
    She's on the line.          
            Great. Just remember
            what I told you.    
Yeah. Hello. Hello, Riff?       
         Hi. It's Tom.          
                        Tom?    
       Yeah, Tom Roberts.       
       Football player?         
                         No.    
    I talk about                
    the weather a lot.          
  Oh, yeah. Hey, Kate,          
  it's Tom Roberts on the phone.
Tom? Why would he               
call me here?                   
            So how's it been?   
              Oh.               
       Little dry lately.       
         Yeah,                  
         but I hear it's raining
         cats and dogs in Idaho.
    Yes. Yes! Oh, man,          
    it's goin' great.           
            Great. (mutters)    
  Listen, I'm just lying here   
  in my new van,                
On my beautiful waterbed,       
Listening to the Ramones'       
brand-new album                 
     On this fantastically      
     expensive stereo           
Wondering if you'd like to maybe
go out tonight and get drunk?   
                      All right.
    Listen, I really wish       
    you'd reconsider-- what?    
            Sure, I'll go out   
            with you tonight.   
You can't do that.              
He's mine.                      
        You will?               
             Just find a date   
             for Kate, ok?      
     Great, I will. Listen,     
     I'll pick you both up      
     in about an hour.          
        We got it!              
Riff, how can you               
go out with him?                
    I never thought about Tom   
    until you mentioned him.    
  What?!                        
        It'd be a change for me,
        don't you think?        
            I never went in much
            for the jock type.  
Oh, cut it out.                 
What about me?                  
What about tonight?             
             Don't worry. You'll
             be in the back seat
             with Eaglebauer.   
               He's lots of fun.
               (gags)           
I don't wanna have fun.         
I wanna be with Tom.            
         (chuckles) hey,        
         I'm only kidding, Kate.
              I wouldn't do that
              to you, huh?      
I'll take care of Eaglebauer.   
                You can have Tom
                all to yourself.
                    Hmm?        
Shouldn't kid like that,        
Riff.                           
               (mocks) shouldn't
               kid like that.   
You know how hot I am           
for him.                        
                         Hot?   
Yes, hot.                       
                      Whoa.     
    "hot," off the lips of Kate.
    My goodness. Ha-ha.         
            Ha-ha, we did it!   
            We did it.          
            I got you a date    
            with Kate. Whoo-hoo.
         Hot equals Joey Ramone.
No, hot equals Tom.             
                    Ehh.        
         Aw, I can't believe it.
         I can't believe it was 
         that easy.             
  He looks like a little cherub 
  or something. Looks like      
  he's gonna fly away to Heaven.
        He's so sweet-looking,  
        kinda like a cream puff.
That's why I like him.          
    I like Joey Ramone 'cause   
    he's tall and handsome.     
     He looks like a poem to me.
A poem?                         
          We get them drunk,    
          we go in the back,    
          we hit the waterbed...
We gotta take turns             
in the back.                    
        All he eats is pizza.   
    I just love the way         
    he holds the pizza          
    dripping above his mouth.   
    He slithers and slides it   
    into his mouth.             
      It's so sexy the way it...
      (slurps)                  
 Gross.

What about Tom?                 
Oh, come on. How often do you   
get to see the Ramones?         
Oh, but tonight we were gonna be
meant for each other.           
        This is my big Chance   
        to get my songs to them.
        We have to go.          
                You'll have     
                a great time.

 Hello? Tom?                    
Kate and I can't                
make it tonight. We've been in  
a horrible seven-car accident.  
We've gotta go to               
the hospital for immediate      
blood transfusions.             
We'll see you tomorrow          
in school. Bye.                 
              Aah!

Let's go get dressed.           
            But I am dressed.   
Yeah, but not for the Ramones.  
I got clothes that'll           
make you fit right in.          
Come on, sexy.                  
  The only thing I'll ever lay  
  is a carpet.

You gotta crash that concert,

        Hi, gang!               
    This is                     
    screamin' Steve Stevens     
    Steamin' your way           
    over station 666            
 With                           
 the screamin' Steve show.      
 (man) oh, wow!                 
     (gunshot sound effect)     
      We're comin' at ya,       
      alive and kickin',        
With the hottest band this side 
of the iron curtain -           
          The Ramones!          
 (man) you know it, Steve.      
           (woman)              
           we love you, Ramones!
            Dig it.             
But first, I'd like to          
introduce the two winners       
  Of the Charity ticket raffle  
    Donated by the principal    
    of Vince Lombardi high!     
         (man) Togar eats it!   
 (woman yells)                  
    Sister Maria Teresa         
    and sister Teresa Maria.    
      (concert over radio)      
Now, that's a step              
in the right direction.         
And to keep this administration 
moving forward,                 
I've made a list                
of new school policy,           
Which I would like              
instituted immediately.         
Take this down.                 
    Girls - skirts              
    below their knees           
      And boys' hair            
      above their collar.       
  And I think it would be tidy  
  if they wore neckties.        
  And lunch is to be cut down   
        To half an hour         
    Because I am doubling up    
    on silent study hall.       
Well, I think that              
should teach them a lesson      
in deportment.                  
      How do you spell that?    
D-e-portment.                   
     Now I want you to meet     
     the two winners            
     Of the screamin' Steve     
     ticket contest -           
    Riff Randell                
    and Kate Rambeau!           
           (cheering)           
     (all) yay, Riff!           
    You're live                 
    on the air, girls.          
 Why don't you say a few words  
 to the folks at home? Go.      
    On behalf of the students   
    from Vince Lombardi high    
    who are here tonight,       
      I'd just like to say      
      one thing -               
    Screw you, principal Togar. 
    We made it to the concert,  
    anyway! Yeah!               
Who says today's youth          
has nothin' to say, huh?        
      (inaudible yelling)       
Those girls have turned         
the whole school against me.    
Hansel, Gretel.                 
 I want you to crash            
 that concert.                  
I want Randell and Rambeau      
brought back here immediately.  
  So you're Kate Rambeau, huh?  
                          Yeah. 
 I just loved your latest       
 scientific American.           
                    Thanks.     
    Hey, would you two          
    lovely ladies               
Like to see                     
screamin' Steve in action       
        As he interviews        
        the Ramones?            
Oh, great. I know               
just the questions to ask.      
That's beautiful, 'cause        
I can't think of a thing.       
I've waited so long             
to see them. I know             
they're gonna love my songs.    
     I can believe it.          
     Ya ready? Here we go.      
     Hey, you wanna keep it down
     out here?                  
              They're tuning up.
How'd you get in there?         
      Professional secret.      
      What's this stuff?        
Stuff is gonna prove            
to the Ramones that I can       
write songs for them,           
So out of my way, dew drop.     
        I'm sorry, but          
        the Ramones' manager,   
                 A personal     
                 friend of mine,
        Put me in charge        
        of keeping everyone out.
    What's all the trouble,     
    Angel, baby, huh?           
        Screamin'.              
  Well...                       
            Good to see ya.     
  Long time, right?             
          Uh, who are these two?
  These are screamin' Steve's   
  contest winners.              
Oh, uh, sorry, girls,           
you'll have to wait outside.    
             Oh, man...         
Can't we just watch?            
    Angel dearest, why don't you
    see these sweet young things
    to their seats?             
We'll go ourselves,             
thanks.                         
    It's gonna be ok. Yeah.     
      Screamin', I was wondering
      if you could give us      
      a little more airtime.    
I'm hittin' it                  
once an hour.                   
                You can do

    for us.                     
                        Oh, wow.
        This is the happiest day
        of my life.             
    Gabba gabba, hey.           
     (birds chirping)           
And I say to you parents,       
        This high school        
        is a failure.           
     The past semester          
     has been a black Mark      
    On the proud tradition      
    of Vince Lombardi high.     
Student Riff Randell alone      
has disrupted classes...        
They can't say I haven't        
contributed anything.           
...And banded the students      
against me                      
      To attend a concert       
      of the Ramones.           
            Hey, yeah!          
                  That's right. 
      ...That awful             
      rock and roll music.      
      You see before you        
      my first major step       
In putting this school          
back on the winning track.      
         I give you...          
      The final solution.       
     (students gasp)            
 Those are our records.         
            Hey, gimme those.   
         (all complain)         
And this is what we think       
of the Ramones...               
 (boy) we've gotta stop her!    
    Somebody stop her!          
    She can't do that!          
                   (boy #2) hey!
          Miss Togar,           
I cannot stand by               
and allow you to do this.       
            Then stand aside,   
            Mr. Mcgree.         
        Let me through.         
 (Eaglebauer) she's             
 burning our records!           
 We gotta stop her!             
     (Tom) I'll get the hose.   
             Togar!             
That's the last straw, Randell.

        since we got kicked out

Oh. Where are you going?        
          To Mr. Mcgree's class.
Well, I'm happy                 
to see some students            
still are interested            
In their studies.               
      We're not students.       
      We're the Ramones.        
Ramones? You're responsible     
for making that horrible

 (Togar) attention, students.   
Hey, quiet!                     
Quiet, everybody! Listen!       
        This is your principal -
        Miss Evelyn Togar!      
                I wanna speak   
                to Riff Randell.
        Quiet! Come on.         
        Into my office.         
             I don't think      
             it's working.      
I know how to...                
You don't think it's working?   
     Start talking, Togar.      
     It's your dime.            
Ok, Randell. I know we've had   
our differences in the past,    
  But I think it's time we tried
  to understand one another.    
I think the problem is clear.   
        I am a reasonable,      
        well-educated, mature   
        adult member of society,
        And you are a spoiled   
        heathen punk who has    
        taken over my school.   
           (applause)           
So let's make a deal.           
I can have you expelled         
and turned over to the police.  
But I'm gonna                   
forget about that               
And just put one black Mark     
on your permanent record        
That will follow you throughout 
the rest of your life...        
          (all murmur)          
  ...If you'll just             
  come out of there right now.  
         (all protest)          
I don't think one more          
black Mark is gonna make        
too much of a difference.       
Eaglebauer, your partner,       
comes through again.            
        All right.              
   (screams)                    
Here's what I think about       
your school records, Togar!     
     You handled that very well,
     Miss Togar.                
              What's that?      
I don't know. I...              
          Miss Togar!           
         (both yelling)         
Well, now they've done it.      
Destroying government property. 
    I think ya failed,          
    Miss Togar. I think we're   
    gonna have to do it my way. 
I think you're right.           
Randell, I just talked          
to the chief of police.         
You're not out in five minutes, 
he's going to Storm             
the building.                   
Well, you heard it, folks.      
     Miss Togar has just        
     given the students         
     of rock-'n'-roll high      
         An ultimatum.          
A classic confrontation         
between mindless authority      
    And the rebellious          
    nature of youth.            
     The moment of truth        
     is at hand. What will      
     these kids do next?        
Boy, this sure is               
rock-'n'-roll high school.      
    Yeah, we liked it so much,  
    we're gonna play it         
    on our next album.          
    To show our appreciation,   
    we're gonna make you        
    an honorary Ramone.         
      (students cheering)       
          (girl yells)          
    Hey, guys, people say       
    that your music is loud     
      And destructive           
      and lethal to mice,       
  But I think you're            
  the Beethovens of our time.   
            That was a good one,
            Mr. Mcgree.         
     (timer ticking)            
            Kate, is it a go?   
         It's a go.             
        All right!              
        Everybody follow me.    
        We're gonna evacuate.   
              I guess we should 
              rush the building.
    Not so fast. Look.          
        They're coming out.     
        It's over.              
            We won.             
     Ladies and gentlemen,      
     school is out.             
It appears as if the final bell 
has rung for these students.    
Has Riff Randell given up?      
    Has she and her             
    fellow classmates           
      Failed Miss Togar’s       
      final exam?               
     Is this the end            
     of rock-'n'-roll high?     
    Just what do you            
    have to say for yourself,   
    young lady?                 
     I have seen the errors     
     of my ways.                
I'd just like to say            
to all students everywhere      
 That you may think the school  
 is yours for a while,          
    But it's always             
    run by the principal        
    and her administration.     
             That's nice.       
Vince Lombardi high is...       
  Is your school, Miss Togar,   
      So you can have it.       
Well, I'm very happy to see     
that you've come to your senses.
  And what would you have done  
  with the school, anyway?      
Rock the roof off it.
