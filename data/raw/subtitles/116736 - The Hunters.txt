THE HUNTERS
At this time we should remember- 
- that justice was Axel's lodestar.
We who are older will always recall
him as he was in his prime:
A real bastard!
Cheers!
Hello, Erik.
To hell with it! Cheers!
Cheers, Erik.
After waiting over three hours I saw
this enormous elk.
He had huge antlers!
The range must have been 270
metres. Are you listening?
l took aim and was about to fire
when the bugger walked away!
Alll could see was his bum!
You can't shoot an elk in the arse
from 250 metres!
May we see the scar?
Come on, Erik, show us the scar!
- The scar! - Come on, brother!
Show us the scar! Let's see the scar!
Show us the scar
Leif!
You nearly died, eh?
A toast to the scar!
So long, Erik! lt's great to have you
back!
Look after yourself! You're a bloody
good fellow!
To Dad!
What a bloody diference!
When Helena took the kids and got
a divorce, nobody cared.
Up here all the lads turn up
- lt's fantastic! 
- Well, the drinks were on us!
l'm tired of people
who don't care.
l'm moving back home. My kids will
soon be grown up.
- I've had enough of all that! - What?
There's a job going up here. If I get
it, l'm moving back home.
- What the hell are you saying? - l'm
coming home, if there's room.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Will the kids visit you before term
starts?
No. They're off to freece with
Helena and her new bloke.
l'm glad you were chosen rather
than an outsider.
I've never had to lock my bike
before! What are things
coming to?
Fill in this form. Hand it in to
reception before you go.
- Nilsson, this is Erik Bäck ström.
- Pleased to meet you. Welcome.
this is Lasse Bengtsson. -  Erik
Bäck ström is joining us.
You two will be working together.
this is the duty list.
Per-Olof Blind phoned this morning.
There's been some more poaching.
Go and check it out. Idon't want
any more newspaper articles.
MORE RElNDEER-POACHlNG
WHAT ARE THE POLlCE DOING?
''l always report poaching to the
police and yet it continues. ''
''Are the police turning a blind eye?''
''Wel l, it's just a few reindeer and
we're only Lap ps. ''
They must have died a few days
ago.
lt can't have been more than a week
ago in this heat.
Here they are: give six seven of
them.
- Bloody poachers! - How do you
know it was poachers?
lt must have been -  unless
Someone scared them to death!
You'll report that there were seven
of them, won't you?
l bet they chose the seven skinniest
and did it themselves!
- This is a knife-point. - Let's get
back and write a report.
- shouldn't we look for tracks? - lt
was someone filling his freezer.
The Lapps always get compensation
from the governement. Come on!
I've got to pick up my grandchildren.
Can you write and file the report
Here's my signature.
So long. See you tomorrow.
Have you caug ht anything?
lt's a b if on e!
Hel l's bel ls!
this is freedom, brother!
With a voice like that you could
have been an opera- singer.
- You'd have been a prima donna.
- l'd have been a poof! No thanks!
Seriously! Remember how Mum
wanted you to have singing lessons?
- She changed her mind.
- She didn't.
Dad changed it for her.
When you sang, the old ladies in
the church became ecstatic!
The old man wasn't impressed.
He wanted you to stay at home and
dig ditches and shovel shit.
Did he beat you a lot?
I've always felt bad about leaving
you to face it on your own.
But if l'd returned, l'd have started
hitting him back.
- l'd have killed the bugger 
- Give over.
lt's too late to get mawkish.
A thrashing never did anyone any
harm. Not me at any rate...
Mint freen?! That's a bit poogy,
isn't it?
That's right.
We just need battens for the
cupboards now.
l'm Gunnar Söderberg from the
local newspaper.
The council have voted you
''returnee of the year''.
You're a returnee! You'll be called
on stage to receive a plaque.
We usually print a supplement and
we'd like to have you on the cover.
Not you, Leif. I'd like a photo of Erik
on his own.
- How do you want me? 
- Like that will be just fine.
One more. Than k you. Hold it.
You may not know it, but you're
viewed as a hero round here- 
- after killing that robber in
Stockholm.
l'm sure our readers would like to
hear more...
There's been enough publicity.
Did getting shot scare
you in some way?
- Is that why you've mo ved up here?
- He doesn't want to talk about it!
l looked th rough that file. There
were a hell of a lot of reports.
lt can't be normal: 15- 20 poaching
incidents in the past year.
- Hundreds of reindeer have died.
- It might sound like a lot.
lt evens out over a decade though.
What the hell ?
Hi, Erik!
Getting down to work are you?
- We heard some shots.
- It was only us.
We were calibrating the sight.
- And looking out for poachers.
- there are lots of elk here.
- We want to h u nt them this autumn.
- Keep us informed.
Bloody idiot!
- Let us know if you see anything.
- Sure. -  So long, Erik.
- Say hello to Karin. - l will.
Are you usually free in the middle of
the day like this?
l'm not free exactly. I'm off sick.
Back trouble y'know...
l hurt my back working in the forest
last winter.
What have you got there?
Nothing. Why?
May I have a look?
What's that?
Salt isn't illegal, is it?
That's okay, lads.
So long, Erik. See you around!
lt's good to get rid of all that old
rubbish!
Since we're painting the exterior
why not put a new roof on it?
- Here you are. - Throw it away!
What do you think?
How do Tomme and Ei lert and the
other lads support themselves?
Eilert is on a training course for
welders, Tomme is off sick.
Look at that!
You made this for me at school! lt
made me so happy!
We're not th rowing this out!
l'm going to keep it!
Dad would go crazy if he could see
us burning everything like this.
We couldn't take anything from that
bloody wood-pile!
lt was as if has the roof too! He'd
say: '' It might be useful  ''
''If it gets really cold some time''!
What a skin glint he was!
No thanks.
- Let's go. - You're in no state to drive.
Don't worry, brother. There isn't a
policeman for m i les.
Come on! We'll go and look at the
Filipino girl!
Okay, you drive!
Let's have some fun!
Hello, lads! Did you wet yourselves?
What do you reckon? Four-wheel
drive and 143 horsepower!
Come on, Erik! Let's go for a spin!
That's enough boasting! Come and
have a beer!
- How can he afford it? - He fiddles
his taxes.
Bloody great!
We need more beer!
- lt's true! Don't you believe me?
- No.
How much did she cost you, Raimo?
- A paraffin lamp. - l told you so!
My treat.
- It's been a while.
- Your beard has grown.
How does it feel to leave Wimpville?
- Wimpville? 
- Stockholm!
Stockholm isn't worth having!
Look at those stockings!
Britt went mad when I got her some!
She's too fat to get them on now!
She'd have looked like a sausage!
That's good.
May I have a look?
- Wh o's this for? - Leif.
- Stop it! - Get an eyeful of this, Leif!
- Stop it, or else! 
- Or else what?
What were you going to do?
Tell me what you had in mind.
Let me go!
Don't make me angry!
I've got a present for you :
I've an extra pair of 
those stockings!
Then you can give me a present!
What do you say to that?
- Spit on me, would you?! 
- Let her go.
- She spat in my gace! 
- Let her go.
Only joking. Okay?
l know who she is! I saw her on
cable Tv!
Three guys at once! I knew I
recognised her!
- But you'd already come by then.
- Nol hadn't!
l want to see your knife.
- lt's no joke. Get your knife out. - l
don't get you.
Show me your knife!
Are you deaf? Get your knife out!
What the hell do you think you're
doing?!
You're trespassing.
This smirking arsehole treats me
like an idiot!
- Do you think I'm an idiot? 
- Tomme isn't grinning, he just...
Isn't he? What's that if it isn't a
smirk?
Let's go home and forget this.
Like hell! First l'm going to see if
he's got al icence for these.
lf he hasn't, l'm going to wipe that
smirk off his face for good!
Hello. What's going on?
Tom me and his gang are poaching
with unlicensed guns.
You're being a bit drastic. That
doesn't prove they're poachers.
What does he want a silencer and a
night sight for?
Erik...
Erik, listen to me.
We've no major crimes like you're
used to in Stockholm.
We have to work closely with the
people here.
You're puss yfooting with them and
they're la ug hing at you!
You're wrong.
Hunting and the forest are his life.
What happens if you take that away?
What happens if we don't?
You're so bloody stubborn!
Come on, Zorro!
- Hello. Where have you been?
- Working.
- What's all this? - A power of
attorney.
lt's so I can examine all the papers
that were kept in the bank.
- Can't we sort this out ourselves?
- No.
A third party has to value everything
before we can inherit the estate.
Zorro! Come here! Come here, I
said!
Get out!
Don't shoot! We haven't done
anything!
Open up!
We've been picking blueberries,
that's all!
Well, l'm through here.
l'll be in touch in a week or two.
Zorro! Come here! Come here, l
said!
Come here!!
Zorro! Come here. Heel!
Come here, Zorro!
Come here, I said!
Come here, Zorro! Heel!
Come here I said! Heel!
- Hello. - Hello.
Hello. You were a long time.
The army built it during the war.
l think it belongs to the civil defence
now.
- Well, well 
- ''well, well''
What happened to Zorro?
He was disobedient. A disobedient
dog is no use in the forest.
There are marrow- bones in it 
as well : elk-bones.
How come you get so many letters?
l advertise.
Lots of women want to move to the
country- 
- and be with ''a nature- lover who's
romantic and fond of animals. ''
- ''Financially independent farmer ''
- That's right!
l get lots of letters when it says that
l sing in the church choir.
Let's see what we've got...
Sh e doesn't look too bad.
''N u rse, div orced, two kids ''
Wants to make a new life for herself.
Not here, sweetheart
Forget your missus in Stockholm!
See if you want any of these.
They don't know who I am. they
won't notice any d igference!
l was thinking about the weekend.
Why don't we go fishing again?
No. I haven't got the time.
enough is enough! this has got to
be stopped! Now!
The municipality has convened this
meeting- 
- So we can talk about the situation
that has arisen.
- Do you want informers? - No.
But we need a change of attitude
before this gets out of hand.
We've always tolerated a little
poaching- 
- but thanks to the attention of the
media, the district risks disgrace.
Are you blaming the media- 
- for this gang of poachers? Have I
understood you correctly?
Söderberg! There's no evidence that
organised poaching is going on.
Nobody says the poachers are
locals.
They might be outsiders.
That's absolute rubbish! this has
been going on for years.
They've shot animals worth
hundreds of thousands of Kronor.
A reindeer is worth 3,000 Kronor.
An elk is worth 10,000 Kronor. You
know that as well as I do!
And what are the police doing?
Nothing at all!
lt's al most as if you're involved and
don't want to do anything!
Shut up, everyone!
l have a proposal. Isuggest a
reward of 20, 000 Kronor- 
- to any one sup plying enough
information to catch these
poachers!
I valued chattels at 35,000
Kronor-
- and buildings at 450,000.
450,000? Surely that's too little!
Yes. I wanted to reduce the
inheritance tax.
There is a bank loan to payoff- 
- and in heritance tax.
1 00, 000 Kronor goes to a charity:
Children of the District.
- ''Children of the District''? - A charity
started by your father.
He wanted the recipient to remain
anonymous.
- What? Can he do that? - It would
seem so.
- What about the forest? - l checked
on that.
There is no forest belonging to the
estate.
The forest was sold piecemeal- 
- in '76, '81, '87 and '93.
What happened to the money?
Dad and l needed it to live on.
- That's a lot of money! - It costs
money to live.
- Don't talk crap! - Dad spent his
money as he wished.
He was senile! Nowl know how you
paid for your lifestyle.
You've been away for 20 years- 
- but think you can just come home
and collect!
- Pull yourself together. - Don't give
me that crap!
You should have gone elsewhere to
find a purpose in life!
l'll get 200, 000 Kronor and buy you
out. Then you can go to hell!
So long. See you tomorrow.
The lawn-mower's broken again.
l'd like to get a new one, but they
cost 15,000 Kronor.
l'll fix it for you at work, free.
Stop chatting and get carrying!
Be quiet!
the window's broken. Close the
door. There's somebody in here!
Get him!
- High-class visitors, eh? - take it
easy, Tomme.
- What select company we have!
- take it easy, Tomme!
take it easy, Tomme!
Calm down, Tomme!
You're not so tough any more...
 Stockh ol m cop!
take it easy, Tomme! Calm down!
He's a cop!
She says they cleaned the place out
yesterday- 
- But Tomme was home by nine.
They all have alibis from nine
o'clock last night.
But they knocked me out! They're
protecting each other!
You should have thoug ht of that
before tangling with Tomme.
Of course a policeman should not
be assaulted like that- 
- but they have alibis, and you have
no evidence for your allegations.
l saw the rifle! It was the same one
with the same stock!
this certificate says the weapon
was destro yed th ree weeks ago!
You were there, weren't you?
Where do your loyalties lie? You're
related to Tomme!
- Are you calling me a criminal?! - No.
l just wonder why we never catch
them or find any evidence!
- That's enough! - Calm down!
Don't lose your judgement now!
Don't get pig- headed about this!
Söderberg...
The returnee festiv aI is nigh. 
Residents past and present will
celebrate the unity of the district.
Hidden conflicts have surfaced,
however.
A policeman asserts that there is
organised poaching.
The accused wouId not comment but
the policeman alleges-
I have the commissioner with me,
- Are the police involved? - Reports
are exaggerated, 
There is no evidence that any
policemen are involved.
Weapons confiscated by the police
are in circuIation again,
There is no evidence for that! 
Weapons have been confiscated- 
- but I have a certificate to show that
they have been destroyed, 
The Weapons might have been used
for poaching. 
Despite e vidence of poaching, no
cuIprits have been caught. 
It's just slander and lies! 
Go to hell!
What's the mood of the district- 
- given the poaching contro versy?
Everything is just fine, 
Troublemakers like you are the
problem! 
- You're upset. - You 're impertinent!
If you're in dire straits- 
- you're entitled to go hunting. 
- What do you know about poaching? - 
Nothing. 
People are fright ened and angry. 
This issue has caused dissen sion in
the area. 
What does the chief of police say?
Any suspicion that police may be 
involved must be investigated. 
I'm setting up an enquiry to see if
there's any truth in these rumours, 
Let's shoot them and get it done
with!
Sit down and sh ut u p!
Bugger it! there's a payment due
on the car next week!
Leig here. We've got a problem.
So you saw it Can we wait a
week?
No!
How about four days?
O kay. I understand. Good-bye.
l need 40, 000 Kronor for the car!
- Give the car back then! - Give your
satellite dish back!
Be quiet! Shut up!
this is all your brother's fault!
Sort him out,l don't care how!
Want a lift?
l'm Anna Sivertson, the prosecutor.
l 'd like to see the com m issioner.
Do you real ise what you've done?
The whole district is up in arms!
l'm Anna Sivertson, the prosecutor.
- Can you prove the gun exists?
- Prove?
- Why should I? - You say the
police are involved.
In order to prosecute a policeman I
must have firm evidence.
lt's your word against Bengtsson's- 
- and com plaints were made against
you in Stockholm.
A cop who doesn't hide behind a
desk gets complaints.
Except up here, where they don't
like informers.
A full in vestigation will be needed
before I can proceed.
- It will also include you. 
- Be my guest.
- Cheers, lads! - Cheers!
Have you seen anything? 
Not yet.
Reindeer to the right!
- We can head him off. - We've seen
him!
There he is!
- He's dead! - Who is he?
- Tomme, it was an accident. - l shot
him !
- Listen to me. - No!
Snap out of it!
Pull yourself together! Listen to me!
We've got to fix this.
think of Britt and the kids!
You won't see them again otherwise!
ls that what you want?
- Answer me! Do you want that? 
- No.
Then pull yourself together. Snap
out of it.
Chuck e verything in the car! 
Here 's your h at. 
What the hell have you done?!
- Don't worry about that. Let's go.
- What have you don e?
l'm out of this! We've got to go to
the police.
There's Stig, Tomme, Eilert- 
- and their kids and gamil ies as wel l.
- What the hell have you done?
- Tried to save our necks.
You don't need to get your hands
dirty, just keep your mouth shut!
Bloody hell !
Go to the cops if you want to, but
go now if you're going!
Håkan...
Listen to Leig.
Bloody hell!
Bloody hell !
That's how it's done: they're cut up
and melted down.
And that's what happened to the
two gu ns?
- And you had no fun that night?
- No. They'd taken what l had.
I've no licence any more.
You didn't borrow a gun, did you?
Not that I recall.
What are these premises used for?
We butcher elks during the autumn
hunt.
We have parties occasionally too.
- You might like to come along.
- Pardon?
Maybe you'd like to come to our
next party.
No thanks.
- You'd meet some real men.
- Excuse me?
Maybe you'd like to be fucked
properly, lady cop- 
- or maybe you'd like to dance first.
I doubt your ability either to fuck me
properly- 
- or even to spell the word.
Hello.
well ?
l met the witnesses.
They are lying to protect each other,
as you said.
We have no evidence of cou rse.
this is due to the...
 cursory investigation at the scene
of the crime.
l shall criticise this in my report- 
- but I can't start proceedings yet.
Getting witnesses is hard.
They all know each other, and that
goes for you too...
You come from rou nd here and
know them al l...
l intend to say this to the cou nty
police comm ission er.
- l shall suggest to him - What?
that I keep in vestigating until
something happens.
We need an i nformer, you mean.
Evidence or testi mon y is ou r only
chance.
Britt, you've got to h elp me. You
said that Tomme was home b y
nine.
You're giving them an alibi.
You make it look as if l'm a liar.
ls that what you want?
No. I don't mean you any harm.
Tell me.
- Go now. I can't help you. - You've
got to help me, Britt.
- Let me go! - They beat me u p.
l don't care what they did!
- Cal m down. - Leave me alon e!
You swine!
Britt! 
Britt! They'll be caught sooner or
later! 
Go to hell!
lf you lie to protect them you're
guilty of perjury.
You can go to jail for that.
- Can you hear me, Britt? - Shut up!
Don't make things worse than they
are.
Trust me. Come out so we can talk.
Hell and dam nation!
I've got on e of the gu ns. lt's the
same one.
Yes, l'm qu ite sure.
l'll expect you in ten m in utes then.
l was in a h urry. Ihad to getch m y
g randch ild ren.
l sig ned the form and gave the gu n
to Ei lert.
He prom ised to destroy it. Itrusted
him.
You're suspended u ntil gurther
notice.
this matter may end up in court.
I've been waving that dam ned bit o g
paper on television!
And you knew about this all along!
Why did you want to meet me?
lt isn't that I don't like you- 
- but we can't serve you any more.
How can you let them treat you the
wa y they do?
- They treat you like a whore. - l'm
not a whore!
l work hard. Iknow what l'm doing.
Do you intend to return home?
After C h ristmas...
 ma ybe.
- What will you say to Raimo? - lt's
none of his busi ness.
l thought...
 he had bought me for a paraffin
lamp?
Dad must be turning in his grav e.
A Chinese whore in the kitchen!
- What are you saying? Go to bed.
- Do I have to put up with her now?
You're drunk. Go to bed.
The zoo is filling up:
Get a few Gypsies, Albanians and
Negroes.
make the place a regugee camp! I
don't want a whore in my house!
What are you then, Filipino? Go
home to the jungle and climb trees!
- l don't want any baboons here!
- Shut up!
Touch her again and l 'll kill you!
Do you understand?
RETURN FESTlVAL
What do you intend to do?
Don't back out now. Some people
th in k you're doing the right thing.
Ogg you go. l'll wait for you here.

- to show that you've been voted the

- Do you know where Nena is? - No
idea.
- Haven't you seen her? - Not since
yesterday.
Andl don't care what happens to

Cheers, Leig! -  Come on, Håkan,

l left home at nine. She was gone
when l came back.
- why was she at your house?
- Does it matter?
Ask them where they were.
l can reg ister her as a missing
person and that's all.
- We must be going. - To hell with
those dead reindeer!
- l know something has happened!
- Cal m down.
No crime has been committed.
We'll follow our usual procedure.
Understand?
We've gou nd a dead woman!
l recognise her.
Ove! Hello, Ove.
How are you? Are you scared of
me?
Eh?
You don't need to be scared of me.
Has something happened?
Come on, Ove, tell me.
Has someone been nasty to you?
Did you see somebody being nasty
to someone else?
May I come in?
Hello. -  ls it to do with that dead
woman?
You sit and whittle in that tower,

Did you see who did it?
Ove, l promise that

Did you h ear me?
He's lo vely.
Who cut the woman's throat?
Tell me, Ove.
Ove. Ove!
Leif.
What?
Leif Leif!
We've got a witness to the murder
of the berry-picker.
Who was it?
He could n't see.
- Then what use is he? - He says
there's another victim.
Don't you remember anything that
mig ht be of use?
- Drive him home.
- Shouldn't he be guarded?
What for? Nobody saw him. Take
the lad home to his mum.
Ove, are you quite sure that nobody
saw you?
Ove!
Come on.
Tomorrow morning l'll getch you.
l'll getch you tomorrow. Lock the
door and don't let in an yone but

Promise me that. Promise.
See you tomorrow. Good by e.
There's a large exit wou nd, so it

lt could have been a hunting rifle.
lt's hard to say without the bul let.
What's the matter?
Look at this!
What the hel l's the matter with you?
My own kid brother!
What shall we do?
- What's all this? - 200, 000 Kronor.

Eh? your own brother!

You ran after the woman, caught

To hell with you and your proof!
Leif!
Hel l! You know us!
We aren't mu rderers!
Hell !

now and again, but people!
this is crazy!
lt's like a nightmare! Have you any
idea how it feels?
l don't u nderstand who could make
such an al legation!
Whoev er it is, h e's lying!
lt's ap palling!
ls it H åkan? Eh?
ls it Håkan?
No, it isn't Hå kan. What made you
th in k that?
Calm down. Nothing will come of it.
- What are you saying? - there's
nothing to it. lt's Ove.
l told them he's tried to get at you
before- 
- but nobodyl istens to me any more.
Hello, Ove.
You look terrigied. Are you scared of
something?
Are you sure??
We thoug ht we'd try to shoot an el k.
would you li k e to come along?
Now you can shoot with a realg u n!
That's right, Ove.
Here's a bul let for you as well.
Don't worry about your mu m.
We know where there's bound to be
a great b if elk waiting for us.
That's a top- quality rifle you've got
there.
l n you get!
- ls Ove up yet? - l'm glad you came,
Erik.
You can help me with something l
don't quite understand.
Someone has sent Ove 500 Kronor.
lt must be a mistake. I haven't
cashed it.
We got one last month as well.
this money is from my gather.
Come on, Ove. There you are. Put
this on.
this will be fun.
Have you shot an elk before?
We'll make sure you get a big one.
We know where they are. That's
where we're going.
Let's see, Ove.
We thoug ht you could stand behind
that hill.
l got a big elk there last year.
Off you go.
Just keep going.
Carry on.
No!!
You bloody idiot! You've killed your
own brother!
lt was an accident. You've got to
bel ieve me.
Hell every one knows that Ove- 
- has nagged us and nagged us for
the last ten years.
He's always wanted to go hunting
with us.
So we let him, out of kindness.
l lent him one of my rifles, l admit
that.
Ask the others! lt's true!
We let him be the marksman.
The rest of us went off to d rive an
el k towards him.
We moved off a kilometre or so.
There was a rustling in the bushes
and something rushed out.
l swung my gu n rou nd, not really
seeing what it was.
l thoug ht someone said it was a
bear.
l gired  ev eryone gi red at once.
And it turn ed out to be him...
What the h ell was he doing there?
We'd told him to stay down there.
We'd no way of knowing it was him!
Ask the others.
Can you can establish which of us
fi red the shot that killed him?
We'd be glad to know.
You can't convict all of us, can you?
You have to prove who did it.
lsn't that right?
Good God! Yes...
Yesl understand.
He's right!l can't get a court to
convict give people of murder!
Get them for com pl icity.
l'll never prove conspiracy either!
Five men shot him! of course they
planned it!
Prove it! Can you prove it?!
There was a bullet fragment in the
Russian.
That would do, if we had a weapon
to compare it with.
We've no witness either!
How could you be so bloody stu pid!
So bloody stupid !
Look...
 if it was Leig...
 my own brother...
l wanted to be sure.
l wanted him to tell me himself...
Erik, that's gross dereliction of duty.
How could they know it was Ove?!
this building is like a sieve!
lt's your fault that Ove is dead.
lt's your fault l can't get them for it!
You're no longer welcome here.
- What the hell did you say? - You're
no longer welcome here!
Go to hell, you bastards!
l  l'm sorry.
lt's my fault.
Can you get them for it?
Not for Ove. Maybe for the Russian.
- Really? How? - lf we could gind the
rifle.
- That's not enough. - It is.
They gound a bullet fragment in the
Russian. That's enough.
I heIped you get the Filipino onto the
plane home, 
That's enough! lt's not just you now.
l 'm involved.
As is the whole district. The police
found a bullet.
lf the rifle still exists, get rid of it
once and for all.
Chuck it in a lake. make sure
nobody finds it. And shut up!
l don't want to know any more.
Have you u nderstood whatl said?
Bengtsson!
l'll kill you, you bastard!
Haven't you had enough, Tomme?
Tom me!
Wasn't the Russian enough? Do
you want to kill me too? Do you?
What will happen then?
What will you say to Britt and the
kids?
Scared now, are you?
- Are you scared, you shit? - The
berry-pick er was an accident.
Do it! I swear!
Do it! I swear!
lt was Leif. It was Leif!
That's enough, Erik!
lt's all o ver.
Just tell me on e more thing : what
d id you do with Nena's corpse?
l don't know.
l don't know...
You don't know?!
- What do you mean by that? - l don't
know.
You swi ne! Where is she? 
Tell me!
Answer me!
Leig Leig...
l swear, Erik, l don't know where
she is.
l haven't murdered her.
Erik...
 do me a favou r as my brother.
l want to do it myself.
l want to turn myself in.
l promise to turn myself in. Just let
me do it myself.
Please...
You've got one hour.
- Then they'll be coming to get you.
- Thanks.
l'll be there. I promise.
Well...
l\I hope to see you on duty on
Monday.
