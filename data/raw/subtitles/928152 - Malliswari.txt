of Bhavani Shankar, father.

But it's very difficult to find
who was the shooter.
But one thing l

They are losing the case
That's why, they are planning
to kill Malleeshwari.
Can't we do anything?
We can't do anything till

One more will make
it a silver jubilee.
By the way, is your brother
fated to marry or not.
l don't know about his fate,
but he's mad about marriage.
He used to pester my mother to dress him

without offering prayers for marriage.
Hail Lord Venkatesha.
Hail Lord tirumala.
Lord of Lords! l'm in ecstasy.

Not a thing works here properly.
Would you like to have
coffee or tea?
lf you don't mind, l'll take a loan
-certainly.

Memorizing me with

Don't lit the passion of fire
overwhelming me.
Suddenly, available of bones
have befallen on me
Shall l play the music
of love my dear?
oh my dear!
My beauty is all yours
How strange this feeling is.
Every cell of mine is excited.
Clam down my ruffled
passion a little.
What's this shivering
of your lips & hips?
Shall l drench you in
the rain of rises?
lsn't that the greatness
of martial relationship?
Every moment is a bliss.
Shall l give you all
the life my bliss of love?
l've become your slave.
Why are you crying sir?
Any bad memories?
Suddenly l felt like crying.
-Manager is calling you.
Okay, come.
Please talk to him and...

Please come & sit.
-Coffee?- No please.

She have and her husband in
Hyderabad are facing difficulties.
He's also working
with the same bank.
So, if you accept for mutual transfer
and go to Hyderabad.
He'll come here.
Both will live here
like love birds...
They'll stop working in office
and start romancing.
No Mr.Prasad...
lnstead of bringing him here,
why can't you transfer her to Hyderabad?
Headache will get rid
once for all.
She owns a house here,
it's difficult to leave...
Finding a house for rent in
Hyderabad is difficult for me too.
Are you a married man?
What's your problem?
That's the problem.
l was born & brought up here.
No one is ready to give his
daughter in marriage to me.
Who'll be ready in Hyderabad?
What's the solution
to this problem?
Simple! Tell her to
divorce her husband,
and marry a local man.
This is good idea.
-You keep quiet sir.
lf you separate ideal couple
like Rama & Seetha,
You'll never get married
in this life.
Silly lady!
My photographs.
Who is he?
ls he your husband?
-No.
Thank god
My future husband.
He's also intrested to
open an account here.
You needn't do anything.
he'll take care of everything.

Do you need any documents?
One passport size photo.
Tenth class mark sheet.

No, l'll not see another girl.
This is the last.
-Don't get disappointed Prasad.
ln another month
the bad mouth starts,
Let's fix this proposal by then.
What couldn't happen in 10 years?
How can it happen in one month?
You'll not say like this
on seeing her.
Don't think l'm exaggerating.
l'll tell about her in 3 sentences.
She's beautiful like
Aishwarya Rai.
She sings like
Lata Mangeshkar.
And dances like
Madhuri Dixit.
No need of marriage to her.
Let her try for heroine's chance.
How can a girl with so many
bad habits become my wife?
Why do you get irritated
for simple things?
They say god has created
all of us with a partner.
The boy will be here
and hide the girl elsewhere.
When the time comes
he'll make them meet.
Likewise you'll also have a
partner fated to become yours.
Who's that? where's she?
How am l to know
she's the girl?
Will it rain flowers
when l meet the girl?
Will the sky be
lit with lighting?
Will l hear any music
from back ground?
Tell me about proposals?
l don't want tales
Why are you doing
all this work?
My wife will take care of it.
No problem..uncle

You are too much. why are you
praising me before a girl?
Oh Did you take it like that?

Yesterday you made her

Today, you've made her

No. no, they don't have good
relationship between themselves.
Brother is short tempered and
sister-in-law has great strength.
So, naturally they are always
at loggerheads.
They think of divorce
before every argument.
They are not bothered about
their daughter's future.
That's not a home,
but a 900 sq . ft. hell.
What can you do?
Locket is very good.
This is not locket, but
Lord Anjaneya's amulet.
My mother tied it when l

ls the girl fair?
-How did you find it?
why would you buy a
costly fairness cream?
lt's the problem you.
You give an inch of liberty,
you take to a mile.
ls she beautiful?
-Beautiful?
She'll be like a mixture of
Aishwarya Rai & Kareena.
lf she's that great beauty,
will she marry you?
Let's try, if she marries,
it's my luck.
ls she refuses...
-lt's the girl's luck.
l mean did you speak
with the girl?
Speak? we had an ice-cream
together in beach yesterday.
Today also we'll meet
and eat something.
How can you be so sure sir?
Asking me how!
l'm a born genius.
l left my bag with
Maleeshwari yesterday.
You're studying 2nd class.
Don't you know to borrow one from
side to subtract 9 from 8?
You told it's wrong
to take loan, daddy.
Nothing short in this cleverness.
Do your home work.
Are you Varaprasad's brother?
Did he do anything to you?
He left this bag in
my house yesterday.
Why did he come
to your house?
Unable to come to your house
Are you going out?
-Yes.
Can l talk to you for a minute?
Sorry, l'm getting late
to my bus.
You can get another bus
if you miss one.
But, you can't get a life
if you miss one.
Your quotation is right.
But whose life?
Why are you so stubborn?
This is not stubborness
but punctuality.
l can't do my work if i don't
go at right time.
lf you can't do one work...
l can do another work.
But why are you
telling all this?
because you are doing
a wrong thing
Who gave you the right to play]
with your wife's life?
Am l playing with her life?
She's playing with my life.
Why are you still hiding?
Look. How she is crying?
Are you crying?
-No, l was cutting onions.
Don't tell lies,
You'll beget girls.
No way, she had an operation.
-Don't change the topic.
Who are you? why did you come here?
what do you want?
l want you both to be happy.
We are happy.
-No Varaprasad told me everything.
Can't you live together at least
for your daughter?
What will you achieve
by divorcing each other?
Divorce?
Why are you studying so sincerely?
lsn't your father in station?
Take the chocolate.
Chocolate must be big like this
-Okay.
Sister-in-law, get me hot water,
l'll take bath & go out.
lf l refuse...
l'll go out without
taking bath.
Why is she so serious?
Why are you roaming like
a rowdy with a belt around neck?
Did Maleeshwari come here?
You said said you'll be
going out of station.
l've postponed it.
l've little work outside.
l'll come immediately.
You postpone it.
l think it'll not be good to
fight before sister-in-law.
No problem, it'll be fine.
Dolly will get scared.
-She gave me the belt herself.
l'm a little boy...
That's why did you
tell her big lies...
Brother no..-Stop.
Give me a kilo eggs.
One dozen? -Yes.
How much? -Rs.12.
lf one is Rs.12 then...
Rs.144 for a dozen eggs!
l didn't ask...she gave herself.
-will you take if she gives?
Leave him.
why are you sparing him
rhough he's lying?
Didn't l spare you?
You mean did l lie to you?
Did l lie to you?
You mean, did l lie to you?
Okay, l did .
Do you know why l lied?
So, l can't speak about
cricket or movies with you.
Fate and holy scripts
is out of question
What else can l talk with you?
Give me the bag.
Whether l told you
lies or truths
But it did help you in finding a
good friend like me, didn't it?
They eat & throw away on road
banana peals.
On road!
what if anyone slips & falls on it.
Whatever l do never
hurts anyone.
My sister-in-law or brother
are no ideal couple
Sister-in-law sometimes
do beats my brother.
after hearing all this.
You might feel you've
misunderstand this peace.
But, l don't feel for anything.

Won't you listen to me?
That's all. ls it the final.?
Are you the only to get angry.
l too get angry.
l'll never show my beautiful face
to you in this life.

Your smiles...
are moonlit nights.
are jasmines...
are rainbows...
Let anyone say anything...
what am l to say they are
nothing compared to your smile.

Won't gold lose it's color
seeing your complexion?
Won't hibiscus consider lucky to
bloom ad reach your hair?
make a life size statue
in milk & flowers,
Applying the bright
moonbeam on the body
And giving it life
with honey.
Won't Brahma, the creator feel proud
of himself for creating you?
You never turn back to see me
though l chase you all the day.
You'll never leave me a minute
all night with mischief dreams.
lt's you everywhere l see.
You'll trap in your love
Making me numb.
You hug me with your smile.
why are you tempting me
so much?
Accept the crimes you've
committed on me.
Are you blaming me after
committing crimes yourself?
make it little bigger...
-Okay.
Tomato gravy is good.
Come, l'll give you also.
No, sister-in-law, but brother is
satiated on seeing you like this
My finger got cut.
Finger got cut?
Then, eat with a spoon.
lf you can't then stop eating
You shouldn't behave like this
with a young bachelor around here.
Why are you so angry?
lf you get a wife in future,
she'll also feed you like this.
You've been saying this
for the past 7 years.
leave about marriage not even
my firs night happened.
l meant...engagement.
Time must be
favourable for anything.
You should've intrest.
My father refused your proposal as
your people couldn't dowry.
l fought with him and
got you both married.
Now, there's no dowry problem,
luckily father is also no more.
But still he's doing nothing.
Think over it.
Why did a girl come home
with brother' bag?
Why did he go to ger house?
why did he forget this bag there?
Why did he lie to
her about you?
ls he in love with that girl?
That's why he took all this trouble?
Did you think about asking all this?
-No.
l didn't know who she is...
That's her address and her
name is Malleeshwari.
Her parents are also here.
Settle this issue quickly.
we don't have any idea about
her marriage in near future.
tell us, when are you planning.
we'll wait till then.
We never thought about it.
Do you've any other proposal?
-Nothing like that.
is she in love with anyone else?
-No.
What's your problem then?
maleeshwari is not daughter.
That's the problem
You mean...
She doesn't have parents.
She is an orphan.
lt's good that she has got
such a good proposal.
You don't think any more.
What are you saying sir?
Do you know who is maleeshwari?
l'm talking to then, ain't l?
you go inside.
She has brought her from
native place to help her.
You mean...maid servant?
yes
Then?
You keep quiet.
l think we've embarrassed you
wiyhout having details
Please forgive us.
-No problem.
Bye...Bye...
Whaere's prasad?
-He is inside.
What's this man?
lt seems some one has loaned
Rs.10 lakh to our bank.
Rs.10 lakh & Rs.15000
Giving loan to bank?
-That is...
Don't come to bank from tomorrow.
l'll send your salary home.
l want to talk with you.
Come yes sir.
Please come ....Sit here.
What do you think of yourself?
-what happened?
Will you send your people with
proposal just for talking with you?
did my brother & sister-in-law come?
They came with a priest
to fix date & time also.
Sorry brother, l misunderstood
you all these days
l never thought you're
such a rogue.
l behaved normally
feeling pity on you.
And you're taking undue advantage
and behaving crazily.
l got insulted for your doing
in my house., ls it?
Do you consider yourself
a great hero?
will girls fall for your
toothy big smile?
that is...
l thought mad men were only
in vizag mental hospital.
Now l know they're on roads
also after seeing you.
Look, if you come to my house again,
you'll lose your respect.
Do you want me to come to the library?
-Don't you've any sense?
l've but, l'll use it limitedly.
-Don't unnecessarily incite me.
l'm sparing you with
a warning this time.
Next time, l'll beat you.
-All right wait for it.
Fro me...
Okay...l'll definitely take you
be ready.
What is she saying?
She's creating a scene to
take her to a movie.
l couldn't take her yesterday,
that's why she's angry.
Movie? lf such a girl request,
l'll go to graveyard also.
He's an accountant
with Andhra Bank.
Look he's here...
he has long life.
My brother.
-Greetings.
Prasad, one minute
Boy is like sword.
He was like a dagger
he's on diet now.
He's raghava rao from
Bundar to see you.
What about maleeshwari?
Forget her.- Brother.
At last we've got a good
proposal on it's own
You don't have any second
thoughts...just say yes.
l'll take care of other things.
Brother, listen to me
-Dear...-Coming.
Greetings sir.-Greetings.
My daughter's photo.
She's good.
lf you tell him about
your dowry demands...
l've to tell you about an
important thing above all.
Go ahead.
l love a girl.
l don't have any objection to
marry your daughter.
What's in love?
After bank closes at 5 pm,
l'll go around with her for a hour
and reach home at 7 pm.
After that it'll be with
your daughter only.
What's her name?
Name is also wonderful.
What are you looking at?
he says he loves some one else.
You've suspecting will l take
care of her properly.
We've a black & white Dyanora T.V.
We brought a color T.V. Recently.
Did we throw away the old T.V?
we are using it in bed room.
This is also the same.
That is love...this is marriage.
Both don't have any connection.
lF you understand that,
You needn't get worried
about public comments.
Discuss other details with
my brother.l'll take leave.
He has told you
everything clearly.
Shall l fix the date
of marriage?
Will he marry my daughter
loving some other girl?
Not some girl, she's Maleeshwari.
She's very beautiful.
did you bring this proposal
knowing everything?
lf l see you again in
my street, you're dead.
Where's he?
-He has left.
Left? why?
what will happen? your brother
told him about Maleeshwari.
What's it brother?
-what did he tell him?
You may also beat
me if you hear that.
That concept is so new.
For god's sake leave me.
At last we got
a good proposal,
ls this the way to treat them?
-What did l do?
Didn't l tell you to forget
about Maleeshwari?
What's so great about her?
No parents, no property,
no caste, or race.
She's a mid to them.
How can you be happy
marrying such a girl?
When l fell in love with her,
l didn't know she was an orphan
and had no property.
You know it now, don't you?
-So what?
Will a lover of sweet, lose intrest
on knowing he has diabetes?
lt's true Maleeshwari
doesn't have parents.
But women don't have parents
after marriage. Husband is everything.
That isn't a problem with me.
Coming to property matter.
Character is the biggest
asset to any girl.
Maleeshwari is wealthy in that.
Coming to caste.
Caste which is used only to
fight and divide people.
Caste which can't help
two lovers to unite,
l hate it.
People ask bride to be if she
can cook & do household work.
But my future wife is very good
in that before marriage.
You call Maleeshwari
as maid servant.
l call her as one who
knows to work.
l can tell people who can listen.
what am i to tell people who argue?
Do as you wish.
l've found Maleeshwari.
You'll get her body
by tomorrow morning.
l want to talk to you about
an important thing.
My life depends on
your decision.
Good book! ln that book the
hero kills the heroine.
But it's revealed in the climax.
lt's suspence.
why are you not talking to me?
what have l done?
What do you want sir?
-Come later.
l know your problem.
You don't have any money, do you?
- l have.
You know one thing.
My salary is Rs.9000 after cuts.
Even if we spend lavishy,
it won't cross Rs.5000.
l'll give the balance to you.
l'll leave to you. Buy gold or
bungalows. l'll not interfere.
What would you like to have sir?
ldli...dosa...
She gave 5 minutes after
chasing her for a week.
Can't you wait?
will you die if you?
Talking about idlies & Dosas...
This problem will not arise
if wee get married.
We can prepare idlies at home.
l'll tell you a secret.
l've booked a flat in MVP Colony.
My brother also doesn't know it.
Nothing, they'll feel jealous,
That's why l didn't tell them.
lt'll take one and a half minute
to walk from corner to corner.
just say yes, l'll look after you
like a Princes.
A foot of jasmine garland every day.
A movie every week.
A picnic every month
A trip every year to Ooty or
Kodaikanal on LTC
there's nothing rich people
like us can't do.
No need to say it now
l'll come tomorrow evening.
Think over it and
say yes. Let's do it.
Hey, two people are sitting here.
won't you ask or love about them?
Are you a waiter or a jogger?
Go and get 2 coffee.
Food items here are fantastic.

you are saying nothing.
ls the book more important than me?
Give me the book.
l'm balaji speaking.
have you sent the
body to Hyderabad?
No sir, l've just come
out of hospital.
You failed to kill a girl.
But claim yourself as
great professional killer.
A man hit me at
a sensitive place.
My hand fell into hot soup.
l hit a pillar and as the door opened...
l couldn't complete my job.
Listen...tell me if you can do it
or else l'll send another one.
No need sir.
l'll kill the girl.
l'm not sending to kill her...
but to kill you.
Aunty, it's me prasad.
Call Maleeshwari please.
She's not at home.
Today is her birthday so...
-who's that?
varaprasad, brother of people who came
here with a marriage proposal.
Look Varaprasad,
l don't know who you are.
l told your people then
and now to you.
Never come to my house
or call on phone.
Don't ever try to
meet maleeshwari.
Will you tell her where abouts
to him? -That's...
Why are you talking to him?
How can l stop talking if any
one calls on phone?
You mustn't talk to him if he calls
on phone or comes here. Got it?

There was a fire on
the tip of his finger.

l saw his legs in the light
of burning pyres.
Every thing was normal but his feet
were facing other side.
Bloody fool wants to
hear stories.
Lord Anjaneya protect us.

My lover's beauty is
like tender young leaf.
her words are little harsh.
Don't consider yourself as
Legendary poet Kalidas.
Don't follow me.
How long do we've to keep fighting?
Am l not in troubles
because of you?
How soft you are
in anger too
You complain that l've
opened my heart.
But never give a serious
thought about it.
Am l not the only way to you?
You claim to have
been born for me,
and say you'll die for me.
What right do you've on me?
lf you ask l'll give my life.
why don't you believe me?
Why do you refuse and
keep away from you?
Don't say again and again same thing

When l go away,
you get scared.

a beautiful girl.
l didn't find her, she found me.
-Really? -Yes.
Knowing well l'll be in
library everyday.
She used to come to library
at 5 correctly.
Once finding library closed,
she came to my house.
Later she came to
my bank directly.
She came to my friend's
birthday party on a ship.
l had to gave in at last.
l was surprises at her perseverance.
-l'm also surprised.
What's so great in you that
made her chase you?
Sir, Maleeshwari is going
away in that auto.
She'll not take a step
also without me.
Sir, madam who went in that
auto gave this to you.
Thanks for giving lift
to Hyderabad and to,
'Unmarried' Prasad for
accompanying me.
Don't search for me.
-maleeshwari.
Shall l drop you in Jubilee
Hills Bus station?- why?
You'll get bus
to go back to vizag.
Will l go away in bus seeing
her go away in a auto?
Maleeshwari is my life.
l'll not have a drop of
water till l find her.
No sugar in tea.
Get me sugar please.
How can you find a girl
in such a large city?
This is phone bill, a call Maleeshwari
made to Hyderabad.
Let's find the address
from this number.
You are very clever.
Tell me the truth.
Getting rid of you is
very difficult
Uncle
Do you suspect anyone
in vizag?
No uncle, nobody knows
about Maleeshwari there
Who told you that she's
going to Hyderabad?
l told about a bank employee Prasad
saying Maleeshwari, didn't l?
His office peon informed me.
So l came here immediately.
why are you still pondering?
Let's file a case against
Bhavani Shankar
lf we file a case now,
till the case is settled.
Court will grant a stay on
transferring the property.
You mean we've to escape
if he plans an attack.
And get killed if caught.
Even then we mustn't squeal.
lf we do it'll be heard by
the law of court.
ls that all you say?
-No sir.
What no sir?
we are committing a mistake by
hiding Maleeshwari from public.
What she needs now is
publicity not security.
That's why let's arrange a
press conference.- After that.
Let's announce about
the property.
Let's announce about
the property.
And reveal the assassination
attempts on her.
But tell them you don't know
about the killer's identity.
They'll understand and
take a break.
This is good idea uncle.
-This will definitely work out.
Even if Maleeshwari slips,
people will decide it's handiwork
of bhavani shankar.
Arrange a press meet.
May be we are at wrong address.
-No, we are at correct address.
You asked me to find the address.
l found it l'll take leave now.
why are you scared?
Will they beat or
kill us if we enter?
l'll stay here only.
You go in and find out.
Let's go together.
What if anyone steals your vehicle.
-lt's insured, but l'm not,
Keep those chairs there.
why don't you understand?
Come on get going.
Keep that on it.
-One minute. -Do it.
Hold this mike for a minute.
why did you call me sir?
Get my cigarette
pack from upstairs.
Get lighter.
Who'll bring the ash tray?
Give me that ash tray.
-who wants it?
l've a husband, haven't l?
Expecting he'll ask l was carrying
cigarette & lighter in pocket.
l forgot ash tray and
he asked that only.
Like 'Bharata Ratna' award, he should
be given 'King of lazy'
Even that will be a waste,
He'll feel lazy to go
and forego it. My fate.
Should l be awarded
as 'King of Lazy'?
l'll remove your limbs
after the conference.
How could you hear all this?
Where's the mike?
where did you go away?
You go to the gate...stop.
What'll you do there?
Don't allow everyone inside?
Find out from which newspaper
and then send them in. Go.
Go.
Don't be afraid.
Which newspaper?
-'Eenadu'.
Come quickly.
May be they wouldn't have allowed if
we bought English paper. -Joke?
What would she be doing
in such a big house?
Teaching little children
for taking care of old
She must be do something
for her livelihood.
You must marry
and give her a life.
Let her come before me,
l'll remove all her difficulties.
You know about
Mirzapur Princely state.
You know a legal battle for property
is going on for 20 years.
To introduce the legal heir
of the property to you,
This press meet has been arranged.
Come let's go.
How nicely she cheated you?
She gave a brilliant performance
as poor girl though she was rich.
That's not cheating.
Though she's so rich,
she moved with us normally.
That's her greatness.
But still isn't it wrong to lie?
Maleeshwari didn't lie,
l lied to you that she loves me.
But your love for her
is true, isn't it?
Wrong, we must wish to see Taj Mahal.
we shouldn't wish to reside in it.
What's the meaning of this?
To publicize us as their enemies
What's their gain?
lf a rat announces there's
a cat in my house.
lf the rat dies, everyone will
suspect the cat.
You mean us.
What should the cat do now?
Should it stop eating
non-vegetarian food?- No need.
lnstead of killing openly,
You can poison her to death.
So, you say knife must be ours
but not our hands.
We mustn't be blamed
Maleeshwari must die.
Bobby, buy a organdy sari
a cotton blouse for this knife. -why?
Weather report
Cyclone warning
A low depression has formed
in bay of bangali.
lt may strike the
coast at any time.
Leave me.
l wished your welfare only.
l'm going away
from you, that's why.
l'll change the station.
This is the fate of heart.
This is the fate of man's life.
A man's heart will never
be happy. - l'll stop it.
You are always happy and
make others cry.
l'm not able to see you sad.
Listen to me and
forget Maleeshwari.
l forget her long back
you've not yet forgotten her.
Don't you feel like going back.
lnitally you'll feel like that only.
Once you get down 2 steps,
you'll get used to it.
Come.
Auto stop
Do you know Jubilee Bus stand?
-Do you know?
No.-Get in
Prasad, get into the car.
l've some work with you...go.
Lakshmi hasn't come.
She's sick she has sent her
sister's daughter.
Okay, tell her to clean it.
Clean it.
Uncle
l told about a man saving
Maleeshwari is Vizag.
He's the man.
Greetings sir. -Greetings.
Thank you very much-
No problem.
Did you see those rowdies
any other time in vizag?
No sir, their slang reveals they
were from Hyderabad.
Can you recognize them?

Keep it with you and get it washed
ironed and bring it tomorrow.
Balu, one glass of milk
Bring it quickly.
Why a flower vase here?
They don't know where
a vase should be.
This is more lazy than me.
Throwing down Rs.1000 worth pant
for Rs.10 worth flowers
They don't have any sense.
You? -Forgot me so quickly.
who allowed you inside?
-who will allow me?
Like drought to Anantapur and
power cut to Andhra Pradesh,
l've come on my own.
lf my grandpa comes
to know, he'll kill you.
Your grandpa BEGGED ME TO
STAY HERE, YOU KNOW THAT?
You're lying.
That's the boon given to you
by god, l can't lie.
Did l say anything wrong?
Did you ever tell one truth?
Your name is a lie.
Your plan is a lie.
Your phone number is a lie
Your claming orphan is a lie.
Did you tell truth any time?
Didn't you lie about your
brother & sister-in-law?
Whenever l lied,
it was for good only.
Unable to bear your
criminal intelligence,
No body dared to give his
daughter in marriage to you.
You can talk about anything.
But never talk about my marriage,
you'll lose your respect.
What will you do?
-why are you coming on me?
What'll you do?
Hey' Unmarried' Prasad, this is not
your Vizag. This is my place.
l'll get you lynched
here with my men.
Bloody Vamp!
l saved you from rowdies.
Will you get me
beated up by rowdies?
Shut up and wear your pant.
How much you'd teased me?
l'll take revenge.
You're not Maleeshwari.
You should've been named Ghost.
Food is ready.
-Bring it here.
No way, we've to go.
Rule or request? -Order.
How long do we've
to go further?
l don't like you calling

digest food eaten
Coming.

Not a wastrel.

How are sister-in-law and Dolly?
They are fine.
Tell sister-in-law to

She's not just wiping it clean,
in fact she's washing it daily.
Dolly is worried about you.
Talk to her.
Uncle
why are you worried dear?
l'll come back in a week.
Why did then mummy say

Rich people can never understand

You carry on sir. l've work.

l got little confused.
Can you guide me to my room?
What work do you've in that room
after Maleeshwari has slept?
Why are you silent?
Balu talks more and work less
But you're not like him.
You talk less and work less.
You are very dangerous.
Oh ! This one.

The window was on

Most importantly it's mouth and
the saliva it let out.

On this auspicious occasion,

Foolish man
Like allowing Veerapan to

They've allowed me
to enter this place.
Come in brother-in-law...
Food is getting cold.
You must be here tomorrow and
arrange everything personally.
Sir...no problem.
l'll carry it.
They are like that only.
Only their homes are
large & spacious
lnside very small and congested
The man who tried to
kill madam till now
Suddenly he has
become a relative
You risked your life to save her
but you've become a burden.
What sort of people they are?
Even madam didn't thank you.
You're wrong balu.
You can work and ask for salary
You can lend money and ask interest.
But never ask thanks
after helping someone.
l'm working here for
the past 10 years.
l never saw a king here.
First time l am seeing
how a king would be.
Go away sir.
People like you shouldn't be here.
l'll go away.

Maleeshwari's room.

You came in and say some
one else had come in
Door is locked.
How did you enter?
True, some one had
entered this room
What's he doing here
at mid night?
Don't act smart.
He told me he'll kill
Maleeshwari tonight.
What are you blabbering?
Are you drunk?'
Just think over it.
They stage managed the accident.
They tried to kill her using
professional killers.
Will you believe them or me?
Tell me sir.
Malleeshwari, you tell them.
First you tell us.
why did you enter the room?
l don't mind if you
don't believe me.
But please don't believe him.
He'll never allow her to live.
malleeshwari, he's like a snake.
Never trust him.
Shut up.
-Calling him disrespectfully.
why are you talking with him?
Throw him out. -Go.
Sorry, l lied last evening.
Go man. go man.
Please listen to me sir.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
lf l'd beaten the day you came
with a marriage proposal.
Things wouldn't have
reached this situation.
lt's our mistake to allow street
people into the palace.
Leave him
-You don't brother.
We mustn't spare him.
we must kill him.
wrong we, don't have any right
to kill another man.
lf you shout like this,
my son will wake up.
He'll ask why are you
beating him?
we've to tell him everything.
tomorrow we've a function
Do we need this trouble now?
lf you want to enter a room,
knock & then enter.
Don't break windows to enter
lt's wrong.
Come.

when and in whose heart you'll
enter as the flowing season?
why do you wipe out smiles from
the couple that trusts you?
Nobody knows it.
unsolved puzzle.
That's why your story

Love without banks

A temple with deity

Separation is a hell.
Grief is the lamp.

Consecration of tears.
Dispair the offering.

oh my love.

No dream ever crossed
the boundary of eyelid.
No shine of lighting ever
remains on earth
Moonbeam is a mirage
deceiving eyes.
Through the wild forests,
lnto the lanes of
cheat & deceits,
ls it sin to travel with you?
Oh my love!
whose name should l offer
special prayers?
Greetings to everyone
Today is Maleeshwari's birthday.
A candle will increase as
the cake for anyone on this day.
But, on this birthday Maleeshwari's bank
balance will grow to Rs.750 crores.
Bhavani Shankar who had the
property under him for 20 years,
will legally handover
everything to her.
Likewise he's making Malleeshwari
his daughter-in-law too.
From now you're the legal heir
to the property with all rights.
Please sign it madam.
The property my father
bequeathed to me,
the property for which my grandpa
knocked the doors of law.
Few people tried to
kill me for this.
Failing in it, they're trying to
make me their daughter-in-law.
Allow me to speak, grandpa.
l'm a girl before
l bacame a Princess.
l too have a heart.
l too have desires.
They are not
bothered about it.
l've great wealth
everyone wants it.
