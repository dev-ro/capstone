Welcome!
"Welcome, Mr. Manager."
Thank you.
Well, are we keeping the schedule?
"Mr. Eberfrø, I assure you ..."
Just a moment. Those are kids.
- Yes, and you're an interpreter, right?
- Yes, but you can't do that.
It is quite common in
Thailand that children work.
But you're a Dane. We don't do this.
If I don't, someone else will.
And if you don't interpret for me,
someone else can make that money.
How can you stand this heat.
Could I get something to drink?
"As you can see,
everything is under control..."
Shit, man.
My... My scarf...
- Mr. Chang, stop it.
- Sorry.
Look... this... I want no part of this.
- I'm out!
- So I'll see you next month?
Yeah, alright then.
Good boy.
To the airport, please.
Leif, do we have any more real bears?
These chinky-beers taste like fox piss.
I know what I'm talking about,
from my time as a cross-country runner.
Leif?
Whoa. A stowaway?
What are you? What?
I know just who'll be happy to receive you.
Good morning everybody
and welcome back to my channel.
Several of you have asked, "Aske,
can we see how you brush your teeth?"
Sure, I can show you that.
I have this toothbrush.
I put some free toothpaste from a
sponsor on and then I just brush.
I start at the back of my mouth
and get well out into the corners...
- Hey, Laske.
- Sune, would you please get out?
- Sorry, it's time.
- Sune, honestly...
I know your birthday isn't until Saturday,
but I have a gift for you in ten...
nine, eight...
Sune, seriously!
six...
Hallelujah!
- Good morning, mom.
- Good morning, sweetie.
- Do you want breakfast?
- Yes please.
- Do we have any?
- Oh, you.
- Oh, there you are.
- Good morning darling.
- Good morning, Aske.
- Good morning, Jørn.
Sirene, I borrowed your card.
I couldn't find my wallet.
Didn't we agree to have
porridge on weekdays?
Yes, but it's a bit too much for Sune.
New home, new family, new eating habits.
Okay. Then, of course, you
can have some too, Aske.
I've only bought four, but sure, go ahead.
- You've washed your hands, right?
- No. There is no soap.
- It is in the starfish.
- That little gray lump? Is that soap?
Yes, it has no parabens or animal fat.
But maybe you don't wash
your hands either, Jørn?
You never know when
you'll need a lead pipe.
- One! Two!
- Wait a minute, Karl.
Hi.
- Hey, Jessica.
- Hi, Mie and Fie.
I'm Fie.
Oh my God, your sweater is so nice.
- Aske, my man!
- Hey, Odysseus.
High Five.
Dab!
- Are you tired?
- Yes, extremely.
I can't sleep.
Sune snores insanely loud.
Fuck off!
You've got something on your glasses.
Take that.
Crazy sick, bro.
- That shitty Glenn.
- Come on.
Thailand is a holiday paradise,
where everyone relaxes.

Are you coming to the Children's Climate
Congress in the Royal Library on Saturday?
No, Pelle. Are you coming to my
place to drink gasoline on Saturday?
- I'm having a birthday party on Saturday.
- Without us?
For the family. You wouldn't want to come.
My mom will bake.
- Shit, I'd rather drink gasoline.
- But my uncle Stewart is coming.
Stewart? The drunk one?
Yessirs!
It's time for shore leave, Goddammit.
Aske my boy!
- Welcome home, uncle.
- Yes, thank you, lovely girl.
- Well, where's the bastard?
- Come on, be nice.
Mom needs half a menthol smoke.
- Terkel, it's been a while.
- Hey, Uncle Stewart.
Beatriz, dark meat.
- Hands off.
- Hashtag MeToo.
- Hey, Leon.
- Dad, can I play games on the iPad?
Hi, Søren.
And, Rune, still a growing boy, huh?
Here, Grandma.
See if you can chew this.
- What are you eating?
- She's having toast.
It's hot today, huh?
Your throat gets all dry.
There's organic iced tea
with rose hips and hawthorn.
Let's not talk about it anymore.
Actually, I have a little gift for...
There is also one for Sune.
I think the boys should be treated equally.
There's already quite a big difference
between them. You know, physically.
- A rock'n'roll flower?
- Yes, do you remember those?
Nah.
Grandma, let's dance!
Samba!
Yes, that's not bad.
- Wow, Super Dario 3! Thanks dad.
- You're welcome, Fnuggi.
- Can I go up and play now?
- No, play on your iPad for a bit.
I also have a gift.
To Aske, whose birthday it is.
- Thanks.
- Congratulations, my boy.
Wow, a... it's a...
What is it?
- Yes, it's one of those...
- A ninja?
- Exactly.
- Ninjas usually aren't checkered.
And boys your age
usually don't weigh 80 kilos
but hey, there you are.
- Look, Mom.
- Wow, it's nice.
- Let me take baby Dorit.
- What is this funny thing? Is it Harlequin?
Good one, Terkel.
Harlequin as a bank robber?
- It's a checkered ninja, can't you tell?
- I've never heard of a checkered one.
That's what makes it so rare.
And Precious. Boy was it expensive.
Just getting it out of Thailand was a pain
because of the sword.
Danny, my big boy, spent five years
in a Thai prison for 10 grams of cocaine.
- 10 grams?
- Just for his own consumption.
Aske, remember that well.
Prisons in Thailand will
make you wish you were dead.
- Okay.
- Speaking of death...
- What the hell is in these?
- They're completely wheat-free.
You could have told me.
John, how's the business going?
It was something with nuts, right?
Thechestnutmakery.dk.
We're not talking about that.
- The chestnut makery?
- Dot dk.
- But it didn't work out.
- You don't say.
- I've gotta go make "chestnuts" in a moment, Jonas.
- Jørn.
Come on, Stewart.
It's good that Jørn has some initiative.
And as long as you're happy to
pay for all his canned compotes.
Stewart!
Alright, I've gotta go home anyway.
Aske, my boy, come over
to the bog one of these days.
Happy birthday.
And as we said out in Thailand:
"Super Dario 3 is a girl's game."
Get it?
Smell you later!
- A checkered ninja?
- Yeah, it's super rare.
- Ninjas are black.
- Actually, they used indigo blue.
But only on missions.
In reality...
Jesus...
Are you coming to the party? Here you go.
Here, Bjarke. It's on Saturday.
You can bring a friend.
- One friend each?
- No, one friend between you.
- What do you think?
- Yeah, what is it you think?
- Can't I see it?
- Sure, but I...
Is that Jessica? Why
don't you go talk to her?
Should I get her to come over here?
Jessica!
Jessica, come over here.
Aske needs to ask you something.
- Aske wants to ask you something.
- What?
Uh, uuh, uhm...
What's up, Moley? Did
you see? He's got no eyes.
- Jerk!
- What did you say?
- Uh, I said...
- Give me that.
Glenn, come on. Give me those.
I just wanna see the mole.
Can I see your paws?
Stop, you fat jerk,
or I'll kick your ass!
I'm not sure I heard that right.
- What's the problem, Glenn?
- He's just so...
- There's no problem.
- Then beat it. You two as well.
Damn kids.
- Thank you, Aske.
- I didn't say anything.
"Or I'll kick your ass."
You've got some nerve.
- But it wasn't...
- Pretty cool, Aske.
Uh, yeah, right?
He's not stepping on my friends.
I won't stand for that.
- See you, Aske.
- Yeah, see you.
Hello?
Say something. Say something.
- What should I say?
- Hi, Glenn.
So you wanna kick my ass?
And I'm a fat jerk?
Yeah. I mean no.
I didn't say that.
If you say anything about me again,
I'll break your nose.
- Got it?
- One hundred percent.
Fuck off, loser.
Beat it, before I break your ugly mug...
you son of a destitute whore!
What?
I think you should go.
He's right behind you. Step harder.
- You're not supposed to be able to talk!
- I'll decide that for myself.
Come on, crater face! Faster!
- Stop it. I'm sorry!
- You're dead!
- And you're ugly!
- No you're not!
- What the hell is going on?
- What's going on is that you'll be killed soon...
if you don't step on it.
Unless we help each other.
- I help you, you help me.
- But you're not alive.
Now I've got you!
- You don't want my help?
- Yes Yes! Help me!
- Then you'll help me too.
- Yes, yes!
- Say that you'll help me.
- Yes, I'll help you!
- What are you doing?
- You just ride.
Way to go, asshole!
You're dead! Dead!!
Mmm, there's food in this.
Do you want?
But, what are you?
Argh, not again.
If you call me Harlequin, I'll stab you.
- Hey, Laske Lard-ass.
- Sune, I'm in the middle of something.
Why does your toy have
an egg sandwich in his hand?
- It was hungry.
- I know the feeling.
- Do you know what I'm doing on Saturday?
- Uh, no.
- I'm going to a party at Jessica's.
- I see.
You know, Jessica,
who you're crazy about.
You're so lame.
Is this a poem?
"You're a princess."
- How sweet.
- Give me that.
- Of course. Once I get my book report.
- What do you mean?
It's for tomorrow.
"Lord of the Rings" 1 to 3.
You can do it, can't you, Aske?
And you'll work hard on it, right?
Otherwise this goes viral.
Thanks, Bro.
I wish you were dead.
Wow, well said.
You're a damn coward, you are.
You may only be a child, but so is Sune.
And that crater face.
Glenn! Do you realize what you've done?
Yes, I stopped him. You're welcome.
He's gonna kill me.
Oh, you wanna cry?
As if you have any real problems.
Don't I have problems?
I'm talking to my teddy bear.
I'm not a teddy bear, fuckface!
I'm a warrior.
- And I find it difficult to take your drama bullshit seriously.
- Drama bullshit?
You can keep sticking your tail
between your legs or you could fight.
- I can't fight.
- How do you know, when you haven't tried?
- I'll help you.
- But who are you?
I'm your new best friend.
I've promised to help you.
- And You've promised to help me.
- What could I possibly help you with?
- You can read, right?
- Yeah. Can't you?
- I can do other things, right?
- Yeah, sure.
What does it say here?
It's a credit card.
It belongs to Phillip Eberfrø.
He's the one I'm looking for.
Eberfrø? That's the same as Jessica.
- What do you mean?
- Her name is Jessica Eberfrø.
That chick you're crazy about?
What's her father's name?
- I don't know that.
- Then who knows?
- Mom?
- Hi, sweetie.
I have my group tonight, so Jørn will
look after you. So no sneaking out, okay?
- I bought buttermilk dessert for you.
- Awesome, but...
- Sune is going to a party on Saturday.
- At Jessica's.
Do you know if her parents will be there?
They will. I've talked to Linda and...
be there both of them.
- Hi dear. How did it go?
- They weren't interested.
They couldn't tell the difference
between ordinary lunch boxes -
- and the Kixi-Box system.
They'll come crawling back,
just wait.
So you talked to
Linda and ...? And?
- And?
- And Jessica's dad will be there too.
Jessica's father, Phillip? That clown.
He thinks he knows everything about toys.
He got my Nixi-Dixies thwarted.
Jessica's father.
Your father-in-law, right Aske?
He's crazy about Jessica.
Ooh! Believe in yourself, Aske.
Ow!
Can't you move your shit?
So, Sune.
Pure speech makes a pure heart.
- I think Jessica is a nice girl.
- Sure. But Aske is just so... Aske.
Jessica is like a little snacky-pack.
Snacky-Pack? Not bad.
- Wait.
- You're so slow. Come on.
Jørn doesn't want me going out at night.
- Too bad for Jørn.
- He gonna totally flip. You hear?
I wrote it down in my book of
fucks not given. It's getting thick.
- I need to get close to Jessica's dad.
- Can't we just give her the card?
No, it must be handed over to him
personally. It's a question of honor.
- Is it here?
- Yes.
This is the building site.
I built that one with Odysseus.
You should become an architect.
Look. Gross.
- Give me that. We can use it.
- Use? How?
A ninja takes advantage of every
opportunity. Always ready to improvise.
- So we have no plan?
- Sure we do. We're going to Jessica's party.
- She only invites the cool kids.
- And Sune.
He's in the 8th grade. That counts as cool.
- And then we have Glenn.
- Who wants to kill me.
We'll put him in his place.
Then I think Jessica will say:
Aske, you're cool.
- Stop it. It's super creepy.
- Yeah, but also a little cool, right?
- Let's pretend I'm Glenn.
- You want me to fix him?
- What's the problem?
- I can't.
Do you know why you can't?
Because you think you can't.
- And because he's bigger than me.
- You're bigger than me...
right now. But not now.
- Can you aim for the wiener?
- That was the groin. Come on, your turn.
- Below the belt is cowardly.
- You're already a coward, so use it.
Here, kick me, as hard as you can.
Come on, chickenshit.
Ow!
- You say that a lot.
- It hurts a lot.
Okay. But does the whole
world need to know? Suck it up.
Nice try.
Up.
See? It's getting there.
So, where are the tools?
- They're locked in at night.
- Then we'll get them tomorrow.
- What are we building?
- One thing at a time.
- You have to go home and do homework.
- But I don't have any homework.
You have a book report
due tomorrow. Did you forget?
"'Lord of the Rings'
is Tolkien's famous trilogy...
about the struggle of good
against evil." Way to go, Aske!
- And my notebook?
- You mean this?
Jerk.
Aske, you went out last
night. You have to obey!
Jørn! What in the world is this
that was on your bedside table?
Uhm...
"Grandma's Nasty Fun-bags"?
Alright, I'll get tools
while you distract the teacher.
- What do I do?
- Get him to help you.
With something difficult.
Can you make a sword sheath for me?
- I can't have this fluttering around.
- How should it look?
It needs to fit the sword lengthwise
and have strings to tie on the back.
And it needs to have a hole in both ends,
so it can be used as a snorkel.
- Do you want diamonds on it too?
- Do I look like a bitch? Go.
Siberius, could you help me?
Aske, what can I do for you?
Is it true that you can make anything?
People do say that I'm a real handyman.
Then can you help me make a sheath?
"sheath" also means "vagina"♪
- A what?
- A sheath. Preferably checkered.
I've never seen a checkered sheath,
but black is so common.
You want me to help you build a ...?
Sheath, please.
It doesn't have to be very big.
The important things is that you can breathe
through it and tie it onto your back.
- You didn't give me much time.
- I guess we're not allowed to make weapons.
Never mind, I got it all.
You just explain to the principal
how Gandalf filled his hat with diarrhea...
pissed in Gollum's mouth
and vomited all over four orcs.
Yes, but he...
I mean, that's how I understood it.
- Damn kids!
- That's how I understood it too.
Enjoy your life until the recess,
where Jessica gets your little poem.
- You mean this?
- Did you think I didn't take a copy?
Give me that!
Give it to me!
Now, you two. Stop that!
Sune, you come with me.
- Fuck my life.
- It'll be fine.
You heard him.
Come recess, I'm toast.
- Do you mind?
- It's super embarrassing.
Then man up and do something about it.
One, two, one, two.
This is Arne with announcement.
A message for everyone
who has signed up for extra music class.
The little choir is Tuesday from 1-3...
and the big ensemble
play is Thursday from 2-3.
Show some spirit, friends.
Everyone has the right to rhythm.
That was all.
Sorry to interrupt.
Damn kids.
And here's a message
from Aske from Grade 7...
to a very special girl, to tell
her how ridiculously fine she is.
I think she should know that.
Yes, indeed.
And if you're wondering who Aske is,
I'm a desperate little boy...
with a pretty big mouth
and a completely flat nose. Well, anyway...
The girl in question is...
You can almost hear my heart pounding...
Jessica from the 8th grade!
- This is not happening.
- Yeah, you heard it right.
I'm crazy about you,
and the whole school needs to know it.
You're a spicy enchilada full of hotness!
That's all.
Sorry for the interruption.
Please stop that.
It's strictly forbidden.
But brave, I have to say.
Believe in it, Aske.
Woohoo! Jessica, way to go!
- Jessica!
- My love!
- Your traitor.
- What? The problem is solved.
- You call that solved?
- What's up, Casanova!
Yeah.
Now you've done the thing you feared most.
Now the chick knows how you feel.
And Sune can wipe his ass with his copy
and drink piss for dessert.
- The whole school is laughing at me.
- Stand tall. We're going to the cafeteria.
- But then we'll run into Glenn.
- Exactly.
Climb onto the trash can.
Trust me. Get up.
What's up, lover boy?
Oooh!
I'll do the talking and you mime.
Can you whistle? Then do it now.
Hey, everyone! Listen up!
Here you see the biggest
jerk in the whole school...
Glenn from the remedial class!
What?
How many of you have
been bothered by this bastard?
Here!
- Me!
- Me!
Me too!
That's why I, Aske from 7B,
in the name of justice...
am challenging you,
Glenn crater face.
7 o'clock on Saturday night at the
building site. You and me, if you dare.
Are you insane? If I dare?
I'll destroy you.
And the loser comes to
school naked on Monday!
It's a deal. You won't be
able to walk on Monday.
- Chickenshit!
- But he's right.
- Come down from there.
- Glad to.
It'll be really entertaining!
Everyone is welcome at the building site!
Saturday night at 7!
Over.
Cool, Aske! I'll come and film it,
so you can see it when you wake up.
What's up, Tarzan?
Do you have some list of crazy things
you need to do because you're dying?
- Of Ebola maybe.
- Maybe Ebola.
If you're still alive on Saturday night,
you can come by. I'm having a party.
Uuuhm...
- "Cool. We'll definitely come."
- See you. Maybe.
Will you tell me
what the plan is?
Instead of waiting to get beaten up,
we've chosen the battlefield ourselves.
- Does that even matter?
- Yes, we're on our home turf.
And now you'll be left in peace
until Saturday at seven.
Unless Glenn won't wait.
You challenged him in front of the whole
school and promised to make a fool of yourself.
So he'll wait until Saturday and
think he's in for an honest fight.
Isn't he?
Are you an idiot?
He has made other films, but "The
Nightwatchman" is his only success.
- I've got a splinter.
- Should I kiss it and make it better?
You bum, I'm unraveling.
This is real cashmere.
- Are you really a real ninja?
- What do you know about ninjas at all?
They lived in Japan in the old days, right?
Especially in the Iga area. They lived
hidden in the forests on the mountains.
They were spies and hired killers, right?
It had nothing to do with money.
They protected their secret communities.
- Who was after them?
- The Samurai.
They felt threatened by the
ninja's religion and way of life.
Their most powerful duke sent 40,000
fighters out to slaughter the clans.
- How did it go?
- A few escaped.
Most died. And then there was one
who somehow did both.
- Taiko Nakamura.
- Who?
Taiko Nakamura
is in a cabin, hiding
with the children of the ten clans,
whose protection he's providing
when enemies stormed the village
he was made a guardsman
an honorable job, given
by the head of the clan
The same wretch who's now
betrayed the sleeping children
and guided Nobunaga's warriors
right to the building
Nakamura meets death.
His courage is indomitable
Determined to
take as many with him as possible
He cuts down 16 samurai
but the 17th gives him a deep cut
and he hears the screams
as they torch the hut
He has failed his mission
and while the cabin burns down
he promises his soul in exchange
for revenge and justice for the town
lightning strikes at the moment
when he commits hara-kiri
And according to the story
his spirit leaves his body
and goes looking for revenge
before the next day
the guards find the traitor
his body pierced by ten blades
and ever since then
it's been said in those parts
that Nakamura's spirit is at work
when clouds are getting dark
His soul wanders
restlessly around, unforgiving
striking down like lightning
into things dead or living
to punish those who are up to no good
When children suffer
and there's trouble afoot
He is forever out undertaking lonely quests
Taiko Nakamura, a
guardian of justice who never rests
- A vengeful spirit?
- According to the story.
The spirit can appear anywhere,
even in a fabric doll.
Rrraaah!!
- Jerk.
- You should have seen yourself!
- Aske, did you eat the last eggs?
- No, Jørn.
I could have sworn we had eggs.
Well, then it'll have to be yogurt.
How are you going to
spend you Saturday, Aske?
Aske has big plans.
He has challenged...
Ow!
Something poked me.
It's definitely one of those longhorns
that Aunt Beate talked about.
I'll give you a deep immune
defense massage, Sune.
- And then early to bed.
- But I'm going to the party.
Not after eight hours of treatment.
Jørn, have you seen my bio-dynamic
massage oil? Then it'll have to be yogurt.
- Dad!
- It's for your own good, Sune.
You gotta go over to
the other side, you bum.
- He's not coming.
- He's scared.
Crater face!
Did you come to get an ass-whooping?
- Come on down, if you dare!
- Fair enough.
He got an egg in his face.
What the hell are you doing?
- I'll break your head!
- That's the way. Come on, ugly.
Aske! Aske!! Aske!
Peekaboo!
Now I've got you!
Yes!
Argh, shit.
- Shall we get a move on?
- I'll kill you!
Hey.
That'll teach him!
Legit bad-ass, bro.
Aske! Aske! Aske!
Come on, chickenshit!
- Right in the wiener!
- Technically, it's the groin.
Ow, damn it.
Come on.
Ow, damn it!
Ow, let go!
- Was it an apology?
- Ow! Yes Yes!
- What do you say?
- I'm sorry.
What?
Way to go!
What's up, champ?
So how does it feel to have won?
I'm here with Aske...
Meadow Path number 19.
- We'll be there!
- Who dialed up Harry Potter?
- As if. Come on, Fie.
- Yeah, Mie, come on.
- Well, Aske.
- I think we've become cool.
When you really wanna party,
yo, remember to make Pesto
So come and be my guest bro
, then you can taste my pesto
It's awesome.
We're at Jessica's home.
Yes, it's great. Duty first.
We start by finding her father.
Oh that pesto
What won't they do for that pesto
in swimsuits or party shoes, yo
there is no dress code for pesto
There he is!
- Hey, Aske.
- Way to go today.
- Really?
- Yeah, it was super awesome.
- You're so cool.
- High five!
Thanks. I did what I could.
- Karate Kid!
- Yes that's me.
- You won't hit too hard, right?
- No, this is my dangerous hand.
Well, I have to say hello to the hostess.
Hey, Champ! Nice fight.
The party is jumping.
- Jessica was just here.
- Did you see where she went?
- Argh! What about her parents?
- They're in the kitchen. Her mom's hot.
- What about the dad?
- No, it's mainly her mom.
- Is he out there too?
- Yeah, they're keeping watch.
- I gotta go pee.
- It's the other way.
- Haven't we seen each other ...?
- Talk to head hand, ginger.
- In stereo.
- And surround sound.
Remember to get her mom out of there.
Just do it.
The bathroom is in the hallway.
Uh, someone threw up on the carpet.
Oh no, not again.
And then there was just...
Pardon?
That, oh...
Phillip Eberfrø!
At your service. What a shock.
I just wanted a bite.
- What have you got there?
- I think this is your card.
Ho-ho, platinum card.
Yeah, if only that was mine.
I'd have to earn little
more per month, I think.
Isn't your name Phillip Eberfrø?
Yes, but with an 'ö'. And I
'm changing my name in the 1st.
My numerologist has suggested Micky O'Reo.
There's a lot in the media about that
toy tycoon. The card's probably his.
You have to go over to Ham Avenue.
- Aren't you Sunes little brother?
- Yeah. Half-brother.
Then say hello to your stepdad.
I guess he's still upset, -
- Because I did not grant municipality
support for his Nixi Dixi dolls.
- Do you want a sandwich?
- Yeah, why not? Ouch!
No, I'm just gonna...
Nice to meet you.
It needs pesto.
What's going on with you?
Why did you yell at him?
I was anxious.
I have to hand over that card.
Alright, relax.
- Aske.
- Hey, Jessica.
- You're awesome.
- I am?
I thought you were just a
little kid with a ninja doll.
No, no, it's just a gift for my cousin.
- You're kinda cute, you know.
- Takes one to know one.
- Shall we Dance?
- Uh, yeah, sure.
I just have to pee.
- Will you wait here?
- Sure thing.
Yes!
- You're not gonna dance now, right?
- Yeah.
Man, I helped you,
and you promised to help me.
- Not right in the middle of the party.
- Fuck the party, this is important!
- Jessica...
- Ditch that bitch!
I'll help you. Just not right now.
- Your lying shit!
- Relax.
- You owe me everything.
- Get a grip.
Get a grip?
You're only popular because of me.
You don't have to make it sound
like I couldn't breathe without you.
- It was totally cool, man.
- Especially when he flew through the air.
- There he is. Crazy fight, Aske.
- Yeah, you hadn't seen that coming.
- Especially that kung-fu at the end.
- Actually, I came up with that myself.
- Cool, man. See ya, Aske.
- Yeah, see you in there.
Oh, so you can take care of yourself?
Take care of this!
No! Wait!
Sorry.
Help, I've peed my pants!
No, it's not... Ow!
Now I need to take a shit as well!
No no! I just want to emphasize...
Jessica, it's me, Aske.
I don't wanna dance anyway.
You not good enough for me.
What?
I'm way out of your league.
You'll have to settle for Odysseus.
What?
- You're out of my league?!
- No, no, I haven't...
I'm not good enough for you?!
What was that you said
about pissing your pants?
No, it was the ninja.
It's all because of my ninja doll.
So I mean, my cousin's. Jessica...
See you, "major leaguer".
- Odysseus, wanna make out?
- Hmm... Let me think.
Yes please!
- Get home safely.
- Odysseus?
The lady wants to make out.
If I don't do it, someone else will.
Well, did you dance?
What are you doing?
I promised to help you.
- I need your help now.
- So you're destroying my life?
Sorry, I crossed the line.
It's just that this thing is important.
How can that card be
at matter of life or death?
It's a ninja thing. A question of honor.
Man, if you help me now,
I'll make everything fine again.
- Do you promise?
- Believe me.
Okay. I just have a hard time seeing,
how Jessica will be fine again.
Yeah that was some weird
stuff you said to her. Lets go!
- Don't you think he's sleeping?
- We can only hope. Come on.
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm secret. Come on.
Don't ring the doorbell.
He hates that.
- Luckily he has a cat.
- A big cat.
Are you afraid of big cats?
You think this is okay?
He'll be so happy about
getting the card back.
- Can't we just put here for him?
- I want to make sure he's here.
- Shit. I think he's out.
- A suitcase. Maybe he's traveling.
Because there is a suitcase here?
Are you related to Glenn?
- Maybe he's going to travel.
- We'll just have to find out.
Bingo!
- What did you say?
- Bingo!
- A plane ticket to Thailand.
- He's gonna visit his slave factory.
- Can you see when he'll go?
- What's this about?
I won't pay a penny if it's not okay.
Yes, we'll go over it out
there. Great. See you.
Do you need something, big boy? Hello?
Anyone here? Hello?
- Gotcha!
- What the hell?
- Stop!
- Let go of me!
- Shit!
- Help!
- What are you doing?
- He's getting away, fuckface!
Hello, it's here! Save me!
- I'm glad you came.
- What going on, Mr Eberfrø?
- They're throwing knives.
- We'll go up and check.
Block the door quickly.
- Are you gonna explain yourself?
- Shouldn't we get away first?
What the hell is going on?
It has fuck all to do with the card.
Phillip Eberfrø is evil.
He killed a boy.
And he uses child slaves to make his toys.
- You wanna kill him?
- Something like that.
Did you see the flight times?
Remember them. And take the collar.
- You mean from that?
- Yes, unless you're wearing one yourself.
It's called Bingo.
- Come on and help me!
- Here, just behind the ear.
- It's the guard! Open up!
- I just need put some clothes on.
What are you doing?
We'll break down the door!
Give me the collar.
Grab on. Come on, over the balcony.
What? I can't.
Bingo!
Way to go, bingo!
- It's you, right? Taiko Kamakura.
- Nakamura.
- You took advantage of me.
- You promised to help me.
To hand over a card,
not to kill people.
- He killed a little boy.
- And now you want to kill him?
It's called justice!
- And what about the other child slaves?
- That kind of thing happens all the time.
Well, then everything is just peachy.
Just tell me when he is leaving.
No. I don't want anything to do with this.
Tell me!
No. Do what you want.
I'm out.
Man, I can't kill you.
We've been through too much.
But maybe it would be easier with...
Sune.
- You won't.
- You wished him dead.
- That's just something you say.
- For me, it's something you do.
No, stop!
Wait!
- Damn kid!
- Sorry.
Sune!
Sune!
What's up? Time to eat?
Stop! No!
Aske, stop! Aske!
What are you doing, Aske?
Dad!
Are you okay, Fnuggi?
Aske, put that pillow down.
- Put the pillow down, Aske.
- It wasn't me. Is that what you think?
It was the ninja.
He's out there somewhere!
He wants me to help,
but I won't be a killer.
- What's going on, Son?
- Mom, you have to believe me.
The checkered ninja is
alive and he's gonna kill Sune!
But...
Stress. Simply stress.
He just needs complete rest.
- But for how long?
- A couple of weeks maybe.
We can't just leave him.
We also can't have him
going around trying to kill Sune.
- I don't think so either.
- It was the ninja!
Hello!
Give him this dream catcher
to take the edge off the tension.
Now then, go home and get some sleep.
Aske is in good hands here with us.
Aaw, poor little Aske.
So you went and lost
your marbles. Poor boy.
It must be stress.
Where are you?!
What?
Peekaboo!
Great room.
It's so cozy.
- Tell me when he leaves.
- Never!
- You wanted to kill my brother!
- Stepbrother.
You accepted my help,
but you won't help me.
You're out of your mind!
You think you're too good
to get blood on your hands?
Try to blaming your teddy bear for this.
- Doctor, come here please.
- I'll be there in just a minute, Aske.
Are you gonna kill an innocent man?
It's him or Eberfrø.
Come on, Doctor! My bed's on fire!
Eberfrø should be punished,
but you don't have to kill him.
You think I'll by happy just
throwing an egg in the guy's face?
I want to see him dead.
He should get the hardest punishment.
Punishment? Um...
Well, why not punish him even harder?
What if we can make him wish he was dead?
We can get one over on Eberfrø, but
we need to hurry. He'll be leaving soon.
Come on! I can't avenge
a child killing without blood.
Can't? That doesn't sound like you,
the great Kamakura.
You just think you can't.
That's what you told me.
And you were right. I could.
You made me dare to do it.
- And now you don't dare to do it yourself.
- What don't I dare to do?
I'll just tuck him in.
You don't dare to change your view of things.
Why have you been haunting people for 400 years?
- You don't even dare to trust me.
- Don't say that I don't dare!
Then prove it. Trust me.
We'll put Eberfrø in his place.
Now, Aske, it's bedtime.
I think you're ready
to let us out now, right?
Yes.
Yeah, you know, we're a little busy.
I'll tell your parents that you
just need complete freedom.
And lots of buttermilk dessert.
Yes, that'll help.
I'll call them right away.
Super-duper,
Mr. Copper, party trooper!
- What's the plan?
- He's leaving tonight.
- We have to stop him.
- No, we need to find a farewell gift.
- One he's gonna bring to Thailand.
- I don't get it.
- We're going out to my uncle.
- The drunk one?
Yessir!
I'm bad at canasta
and rummy and whist
I always lose at UNO,
oh man it makes me pissed
It's never ever me
who plays the last trick
But I'm the best in the
world at playing with my...
I'm no good at tennis,
I can't play squash
I can't play football,
because I can't toss '
As for basketball, I
can't even roll and pick
But I'm the best in the
world at playing with my...
Who's knocking?
The world's best at playing with my...
I'm on my way
The world's best at
playing, at jacking, at jerking
at playing with my...
- Hello!
- Alright then.
Hi.
Aske my boy, how nice.
I was about to sing "dick".
- Can I come in?
- Sure, come in.
- Are you okay?
- Sure.
Do you want a fried egg?
- No thanks.
- Make yourself at home.
I just came to ask
if you can help me with something.
We have an assignment at school
about drugs.
- I don't take that kind of shit.
- No, but you're so knowledgeable about life.
Yes, that's true. I've been around
the block a few times, as they say.
I move in certain circles. I
can spot a louse by his trot.
Yeah, I know where David bought his beer.
I have to investigate how
people get their hands on drugs.
You just make a call
and then it's delivered to your door.
- Really?
- That's how it happens.
- I mean, I think. What do I know?
- But who do you call?
I don't know, Aske.
And even if I did...
I couldn't just tell you that
his name is Scooter-Schrødder.
And what do you say to Scooter-Schrødder?
You say, "What's up, Square?"
I shouldn't have said that.
That's his code name.
- And then you just order?
- Yeah, kinda covertly.
"Can you look over?
I'm baking, but I've run out of flour."
- And then he brings it?
- Not to anyone.
You couldn't just call. Well yeah,
maybe if you said hello from Stewart.
Sure, maybe on a single festive occasion...
or two.
Three at most. And never on a weekday.
Unless it's summer.
Do you have a number,
so I can call and talk to him?
No, I can't damn well give you his number.
It's safely written down
in my little black book,
- which only I have access to.
But this is an interesting assignment.
Want a can of mackerel or something?
Aske?
Hm, I could have sworn I had guests.
Well, to hell with it.
Yessirs.
Snowman Pat, Snowman Pat,
Snowman Pat and his big, white bag
My white flour is for you to devour.
Call me and I'll bring within the hour.
Bitches in my bed, powder in my pocket
Drinking that Dom Perignon by the bucket
Moving that 'cain,
pushing that snow
Yeah?
What's up, Square? It's...
I mean, I'm Glenn.
- Stewart says hi.
- The drunk one? Okay.
Yes, I'm about to bake.
You know, cinnamon rolls or something.
- But I need some flour.
- Where are you?
I'm in my room.
I mean, I'm in the bath.
What? Are you stupid or what?
Yes.
Okay. I need to run a few errands.
Meet me in EFKA's parking garage.
Hi, big boy.
Do you want a buttermilk dessert?
Not right now.
I mean, right now is fine.
How much do you need?
- We can make it to-go.
- I don't need anything.
- Can you make up your mind?
- Just let me know.
Okay, Aske?
- Hello?
- Sorry, one kilo.
- It's a bad connection.
- One kilo.
- One kilo? Like a thousand grams?
- Exactly.
- What are you doing?
- It's part of the plan.
Turning down buttermilk
dessert? Great plan.
- Can you afford all that flour?
- Sure.
Otherwise, there'll be smoke
in the kitchen. Get my drift?
- Yeah, of course.
- See you soon.
On cloud nine, I'm on a roll
Pushing that snow
I'm pro fuckboy,
I've tried it befo'
pushing that snow
Your dick shrinks
and my wallet grows
Hi, Square.
I'm Glenn.
- You?
- Yes.
Okay.
You probably shouldn't take it all at once.
You have no problem with me being a kid?
If I don't sell to you,
someone else will.
- You got money?
- Hell yeah. Here you go.
- Does it say "idiot" on my forehead?
- Yes.
- Give me that money, man!
- That was stupid.
Really stupid.
- Don't leave me here!
- Don't worry, the police are on their way.
Help! Let me out!
Somebody!
Be so polite, so it's open.
Are you sure that is enough?
Yes. When they find it, they block
him inside and throw the key away.
Beware of the needle.
It's real cashmere.
- I have had handwork since then.
- Beautiful, so then you should be an architect.
- I have something for you.
- To me? A gift?
No, one... What is it?
A Steiner binoculars?
Turn around. I thought,
You must be ready for your mission.
You can't go
and flutter with it there.
- You made a...
- Of cardboard, so it can't tolerate water.
- I have nothing for you at all.
- I've had so much.
It's been fun.
Yes, it does.
Yes, give it a slip,
tos. We're going to war.
For security reasons
and because of the risk of theft -
- Must baggage and other belongings
not left unattended.
Good when Eberfro comes,
he must check his luggage in there.
When he looks away,
you jump into his bag.
Hello?
What are you doing with my phone?
I just had to find my sword.
Is he there?
There, it's him.
This is it.
What? Oh no!
He went directly to security!
He will take the bag on board.
Sorry, passing through.
- No!
- Fuck. So what we do?
You have to get in there
and then change in Bangkok.
Okay, now.
- Good luck.
- Yes, go now.
- May I help the next one?
- It must be me.
I'm gonna play golf.
It's nice to travel a little.
Head full of thoughts
but the body feels empty
I have reverse homesickness
because I know it will never be
like before I met you
Suddenly the race was I over
and I lost it
It was a brief moment
I just found out you came
before you left
Before you left away from me
away with you
up and off you are on the way
I'll be back and as you say
I'll straight my back
I know it's over
there's no more to say
Because you are one of them
never looking back, only forward
I hope you find your home
Sniff it, fuck!
Taxi!
Will pay cash.
- You're done, child murderer!
- What's going on?
I really don't know...
It is not...
It's not mine.
Help me.
I want to call my lawyer
That hurts!
Think he does.
Take a look here.
- Show it to Aske.
- Aske, look at Glenn.
- Nice ass, anyway.
- It's nicer than his face.
- Hey, Aske.
- Hi.
Thanks for the sweet message. I was
really touched by what you said.
- What message?
- Just listen to it. You will die.
Hey, it's me.
I just want to apologize for
all I did to you.
You're the best person
I've ever met.
You taught me to dare
trust someone again. Goodbye.
- Isn't that sweet?
- So nice. That's incredible!
I was fainting.
It really came from the heart.
- Shh, he's behind you.
- Yes, he's standing behind you.
- No way!
- Oh my God!
What just happened?
Hashtag dream prince.
Hashtag summer wedding.
Here, Aske. Buttermilk for you.
- With lots of biscuits.
- Go ahead, Aske.
Jørn, you haven't
touched your quinoa.
Sune, want to go first?
Uh, delicious. Thank you, Sirene.
I'd like to propose a toast for Sirene.
And one for you, Aske.
Thanks for taking
so good care of us.
You are so cute, Jørn.
And congratulations on the patent.
Yes, Snacky-Pack.
EFKA has bought 6000 pieces
so I can help a little bit
with the bills.
Toy tycoon Phillip Eberfrø
was arrested today in Bangkok.
Eberfrø was charged with drug smuggling,
and bloody fingerprints on a teddy bear -
- also led to the arrest
of the factory manager.
- Damn.
- Tough world.
You heard about the drug dealer
found in the trunk of a car?
- Was he caught by a superhero?
- You can call it that.
- It's a vigilante.
- Yes, but it was well done.
- What does such a person do?
- Yes, wonder what he's thinking.
The pathwalks are
ravaged by purse burglars.
Glostrup Police is powerless.
I guess he thinks:
"If I don't do anything,
no one will do."
Aske, where are you going?
I'm just going out.
Child help services, Stewart speaking.
Hello, my name is Rasmus,
and I have a big problem.
It's that I'm deaf.
Does that mean you
can't hear anything at all?
So, you can't hear anything at all?
Hello?
Child help services, Stewart speaking.
- Hi, my name is Solralf.
I'm calling because my stepfather
spanks me.
It's terrible though.
How can an adult
and responsible person -
- to do this to the poor young Solralf?
Tell your stepfather he should spank
your mother or a lamp instead.
What's her name, Gurkemina?
Can you feel good, kid.
- Child help services, Stewart speaking.
- It's Kirsten. I'm calling...
You know why?
Because my rabbit just died.
My Goodness. I would like very much that
you could talk more about that.
- Oh, would you?
- No, April fool's!
But it's not April 1st.
Why are you saying that?
Oh I can see. December.
Well, I'm actually sincerely
interested in your dead rabbit.
- Are you?
- No, not at all.
Now I just simply lied.
Have a good one.
- Child help services, Stewart speaking.
- Hi, my name is Mikkel.
Good morning, Mikkel.
What's on your mind?
In a party not long ago
someone asked me, -
- If I wanted to sniff lighter gas.
And then it's escalated. Now I am
addicted on cocaine and heroin.
Well, don't you tell me.
I was thrown out of school, and my
mother don't want me living with her, -
- Because I'm stealing so much.
And I'm being questioned in the church.
- You are in a big trouble, no?
- Yes, my life is a nightmare.
- We should do something about it.
- You think you can help me?
I know I can. We must elaborate
a good plan of action.
The authorities must also be involved...
- The egg timer. Time for lunch.
- But the action plan...
My action plan right now is
goulash. Sesame seeds!
Baaaah!
