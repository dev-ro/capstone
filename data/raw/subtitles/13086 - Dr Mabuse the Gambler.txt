Important Secret Agreement Stolen!
The Dutch courier who was to have brought to Geneva the
secret trade agreement between Holland and Switzerland, has
been found assaulted and dazed in the express train. The
briefcase containing the trade agreement is missing. The culprit
has left no trace. It is feared that if the agreement is made public,
Switzerland will back out, which would leave the involved Dutch
coffee and cocoa firms facing a virtual disaster.</b>

must be bad!"

"I have the pleasure, ladies and
gentlemen, to introduce to you the

Miss Cara Carozza!
"The Hotel Excelsior reserved
a box for me."
Box 3, Seat 2
Edgar Hull, only son of the
industrialist Paul Hull, 90
million, member of
'17+4' club.
"Don't let me interfere, gentlemen. I'm
going home. My headache is killing me."
"Good evening, Mr. Hull!"
"Don't you know me--?!"
"Yes--! You do know me, Mr. Hull--!"
"You wanted to go to the club, Mr. Hull--?
May I join you--?"
The club "17+4" --
"Balling..."
Hotel Excelsior, Room 111, is reserved
for you. You will find further
orders there.
"Hull is losing like crazy-- --"
"A Mr. Balling is holding the bank."
"-- -- the gentleman is playing with the
cards provided by the club itself -- --"
"I would advise you, Mr. Hull, to stop
playing for today."
"Consider my embarassment. Mr. Hull is a
guest of your club; permit me to hold the
bank for a few more rounds!"
"Gentlemen, it is five o'clock. I think
it is time to stop."
Va banque!!!
"I have lost again -- --"
"Until tomorrow afternoon, you will have to
content yourself with 20,000 marks and a
promissory note for 150,000 marks. May
I ask for your address?"
Hugo Balling
Excelsior Hotel
112.
"I have played -- and lost -- but to whom?"
"To your friend!"
"Friend? -- -- I've never seen the man
before! Who actually brought him to
the Club-- --?"
"I think you've been drinking too much, Hull.
First you play va banque despite your bad
luck, and then you claim to not know the
man whom you yourself brought here -- !"
"You play va banque -- hold the highest cards
in your hands -- and throw them away!?"
"What's going on with me --?!"
Hugo Balling
Excelsior Hotel
112.
"Excuse me -- I must have mistaken the
door. I'm looking for room 112 --"
"Then Mr. Balling must have given me the
wrong room number."
"My name is Balling -- Hugo Balling."
"Did you write that?"
Hugo Balling

"Then I don't owe you 150,000 marks
from gambling?"

<b>State Attorney von Wenk.</b>
"I'll come straight to the point, Mr. Hull:
I have come to tell you that as of today,
you are under the direct protection of
the police!"
"For about six weeks, the authorities have
been receiving complaints about
some rapacious gamblers. In no case could
any card-sharping be proved. But their
luck in the game is so extraordinary
that something fishy must be going on."
"It is always somebody different -- one
time a young gentleman, at another a
respectable petit bourgeois, today a
blond American, tomorrow a black-
haired Russian--"
Hugo Balling
Excelsior Hotel
112.
"Perhaps he is one of them."
"Your experience with that mysterious
Mr. Balling, which Karsten told me
about, prompted me to request your
assistance."
"Am I really nothing more to you than
an instrument?"
"You should have been with Hull for
ten minutes!"
"-- He will present the promissory note
when you least expect it -- then,
you shall put me on his track! One more
thing, Mr. Hull. Please treat my visit as
completely personal and confidential."
<b>State Attorney von Wenk</b>
"She's here now -- !!!"
<b>State Attorney von Wenk</b>
"What dangerous acquaintances have
you been making lately?"
<b>State Attorney von Wenk</b>
"He would like me to introduce him to
a few gambling clubs."
"Gardi, do nothing foolish! Don't get us
into the soup with that State Attorney
of yours!"

An honest trade has a gold lining.
"I will gladly introduce you, but you will
have to forego her name -- -- none of us
know it. In gambling circles, she is
called "Lady Passive" as she herself
never gambles."
"Madam, allow me to introduce you to
Mr. von Wenk -- a fervent admirer of
your beauty."
"Gentlemen, who will take over the
bank?"
"How does a woman like you get into
such company -- among pushers,
gamblers, and prostitutes?"
"I have become sluggish, Mr. von Wenk!
To rise to life, I require strong
sensations."
"But tell me, why don't you gamble?"
"I prefer to observe the passions of
others triggered by gambling, without
getting too close to the gamblers
themselves."
"You will accept it? Cost $50,000 at
Tiffany in New York! Against the
bank--!!!"
"Will you accept -- ?
"Four --"
"Do you want character studies? Then
look at that Russian woman -- when
she is losing, she is fabulous!"
"I had only three -- I wanted to buy --
but I could not! He looked at me with
his evil eyes -- like a devil!"
"Yes -- he had evil eyes -- like a beast
of prey -- "
"When gambling, nobody looks like a
saint!"
"If you are the gentleman I take you
for, please help me leave the room
unnoticed!"
"What does that mean!?"
"Is a Mr. Hull here?"
Edgar Hull
I confirm that I owe Mr. Balling
150,000 marks - one hundred and fifty
thousand. Payment due by November
21st at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
E. Hull
You are warned. It is entirely my own
affair that I did not collect the 150,000
marks. A game is a game. A matter
between you and myself and not the
business of any State Attorney!
The next morning.
<b>State Attorney von Wenk</b>
"Disguised as a gaming-crazy pusher in
secret gambling clubs, I will try and lure
the "Great Unknown" to my track -- and
you shall help!"
"Please go at once to La Carrozza and get me
from her a list of the secret gambling clubs,
which I then will visit every evening."
Dear Mr. von Wenk:
Since I believe I that owe you an
explanation and do not wish you to
regard me as a woman seeking trivial
adventures in gaming clubs, I would
ask you to take tea with me at five.
Yours obediently,
Countesse Told
"I thank you--"
"You have saved me from an embarassing
dispute and my husband from the bitter
discovery that his wife seeks relief from
the dead atmosphere of his house in
night-spots and gambling-dens."
"I need life, the strong breath of the
unusual-- sensations -- adventures
-- but I am afraid they are extinct!"
"You are incorrect, Countess. Adventures
still exist -- and I am right in the middle
of one of the most interesting! Would you
like to take part in it?"
"The enemy I pursue -- I do not know him --
I only know he is there."
"For the first time in my life I am frightened
for you. Be wary of Wenk -- I want to
warn you!"
"Give me convincing proof your "Great
Unknown" is real and I will become your
ally in the fight against him!"

opportunity you fail like a little girl and

"Hull must disappear! And above all --

"Georg will do it -- both of you will help him.
La Carozza will engineer it."
"I've just dropped in, Gardi, to tell you of a
marvelous new club that's being opened
tonight. We absolutely have to go there!"

"In any case go there with La Carozza, but
behave as innocuously as possible so that
she doesn't become suspicious. There is
no danger -- I will be there first!"
"The Countess very much regrets that she
is not able to receive the State Attorney but
the ladies and gentlemen have been invited
to a spiritual seance at Councillor Wendel's
tonight--"
11 Haydn Street.
"You seem to possess the 'open sesame' to
all secret doors, Mr. State Attorney!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have the honor
and the great pleasure to declare the Petit
Casino open in your esteemed presence!"
"The Petit Casino has set itself the task to
satisfy your most discriminating demands
in every respect. Among the most modern
settings and decorations you shall be
transported back to that Golden Age whose
only motto was: 'Everything that pleases is
allowed.'!"
"Ladies and gentlemen, I have thus
explained to you the inestimable merits
of the Petit Casino -- but what if the
police were ever to try and interfere in
our affairs and disturb us at our game?
Well, then--"
"She is no good! She has no talent!"
"Now, ladies and gentlemen, you are
informed about everything -- play
may commence!"
The other world.
"An alien element is among us!"
"I am afraid, ladies and gentlemen, the
troublemaker is me!"
"Do not be disturbed, ladies and gentlemen,
I will be happy to keep the Countess
company!"
"I fear that there is nothing in the world to
interest me for long -- Everything that
can be seen from a car, from an opera box,
or from a window is partly disgusting,
partly uninteresting, always boring!"
"You are right, Countess -- nothing in the
world is interesting for long -- except for
one thing--"
"Playing with people and their destinies!"
"See to it that La Carozza does not notice my
leaving -- I am going to telephone the police
and have the party raided. On no account
leave Hull alone!"
"I have asked Dr. Mabuse to give us the
pleasure of his company Thursday night..."
"But where is Wenk?"
"Listen, the whole thing is bad news. If that
State Attorney sends the police chasing after
us, we will be in the soup!"
"The cars are parked in the side street--"
"The woman! Arrest the woman--!"
"Shouldn't we do something to rescue La
Carozza?"
"What do I care about La Carozza now? Let
her go to hell!"
"I give you one more week to liquidate Wenk,
so you can plan everything reliably -- but
not a minute longer -- I want to be rid
of him!"
"Would it be very impolite if I -- cancelled
that Dr. Mabuse's invitation...?"
"I cannot really explain it! I don't know why I
invited him nor why I now want to withdraw
the invitation -- I --"
"State Attorney von Wenk wishes to know if
the Countess receives!"
"The other day, you promised me your help
-- today I come to ask for it."
"You would have to volunteer to join that
Carozza woman in prison, as if you too had
been raided in a gaming club. I am
convinced you would succeed where we men
have failed to get La Carozza to talk!"
"Think: this is about getting a lead on one of
the most dangerous criminals of all times.
You would be doing your duty for society!"
"What! He is in the round room -- Where
Carozza used to stay - ?!"
"This room shall be put in order
immediately, Spoerri!"
"All right, tonight at police headquarters!"
"Miss Carozza - what a coincidence!!! Just
think, they arrested me! At Schramm's!
Then they dragged me to this place. I
am outraged -- beside myself -- !"
"I have heard that they connect you with that
terrible murder story! Ridiculous-! How
do they get such an absurd notion! Were
you even in the vicinity when the murder
took place...?!"
"Are you not ashamed of yourself?"
"He's at his wits' end, this State Attorney!
And now he's expecting help from me - !
Me, who is more miserable and lost than
a stray dog - !"
"But after all, he did not mean to leave you -
-- he is dead --"
"Who is dead -- ??!"
"Hull."
"Who could kill him? He can't even destroy
himself."
"Who are you speaking of?"
"Who he is -- nobody knows! He is there!
He lives! He towers over the city! He is
damnation and eternal bliss! He is the
greatest man alive! And he has loved me!"
"How can this be?"
"And now tell me, what could force me to
betray such a unique man to you miserable
creatures -- !"
"Forgive me, Miss Carozza. I did not know--
that you love him --"
Dear Mr. von Wenk,
I agreed under false pretenses to sound
out Miss Carozza in prison. I thought
that I would find the paid tout of a
notorious criminal -- only to find a
woman full of love, before whose simple
and unconditional feelings
I am not suitable to be your ally.
Please forgive me if for that reason I
have to disappoint you.
Yours,
Dusy Todd, Countess
The Great Game--
"What is your attitude toward
Expressionism, Doctor?"
"Expressionism is mere pastime -- but why
not? Everything today is pastime --!"
"Since everything is a pastime, Doctor, I
hope you will not hold it against me if we
now go over to play poker..."
"Your husband has luck in the game!"
"I have encountered something which until
recently I did not believe existed -- something
of greater value and more deeply stirring
than even the strongest sensation --!"
"Love--"
"There is no love -- there is only desire!
There is no happiness - there is only the will
for power!"
"Told seems to have almost incredible
luck -- !"
"Shall I give you some evidence of the power
of will?"
"You Cheat!"
"Mine---!!!"
