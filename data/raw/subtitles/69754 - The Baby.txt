- Hi, there.
- Hi. Is this the Wadsworth House?
- Mm-hm.
- Thank you.
Can I help you?
Mrs. Wadsworth?
Oh, you're from Welfare?
- Come on in.
- Thank you.
- What you say your name was?
- Mrs. Gentry, Ann.
- Go right in.
- Thank you.
It was nice of you to call first.
Most of you workers just pop in.
Please sit down,
make yourself comfortable.
This is just a routine visit,
Mrs. Wadsworth.
But I'm sure you're an old hand
at this sort of thing.
You might say so, after all these years.
Let's see... When was the last time
you saw a worker?
Oh, about six months ago.
We usually see one of you county people
about twice a year.
Well, you know, er...
a worker will be glad to come more often,
if there's a need for it.
We're a very self-sufficient family.
Are you going to be Baby's new worker?
I don't mind telling you, Mrs. Wadsworth,
I... I made a special effort
to get this assignment.
You did? Now, why is that?
Well, I heard about the case
from one of the other workers,
and it was impossible
not to be interested.
I see.
What is the composition
of the family now?
Same as before.
No changes to speak of.
In other words -
you, your two daughters and your son?
Baby, mm-hm. We've been living
in this house ever since he was born.
I notice you call him Baby,
and the case history
doesn't show any other name.
- What is his real name?
- Just Baby.
- I'm Germaine.
- My daughter. This is Mrs. Gentry, honey.
She's going to be Baby's new worker.
Nice to meet you.
- Now, what about the family income?
- Just what the county gives us for Baby.
Your daughters, are they employed?
Uh, my daughters?
No. They help out the best they can,
but it doesn't come to too much.
Alba gives tennis lessons
in the afternoon, and Germaine...
Once in a while, I do a TV commercial.
Sometimes, I don't know
how we make ends meet,
but we always seem to manage.
Isn't there any money
from your husband's pension?
- Or his Social Security?
- Well, how could there be?
She thinks he's dead.
That man didn't die!
No such luck!
It happened just before Baby was born.
When I needed him most,
he ran off and left us.
- But then, all that's in the record.
- Oh, I'm sure it is.
My husband was a very weak man,
Mrs. Gentry.
- No character.
- None at all.
And you've had no contact with him
since he left?
As far as I'm concerned,
he might as well be dead.
I understand how you feel,
Mrs. Wadsworth.
Well, like all things,
some good came out of it.
We got used to being without a man.
- I'd like to see Baby before I leave.
- Do you have to?
Well, yes. I see all my clients.
Why? Is there any reason I shouldn't?
No, of course not.
It's just that Baby's taking
his afternoon nap.
Unless you think it's important.
Oh, I'll be careful not to wake him.
Besides, I'm sure you know
that it's one of the basic requirements
of my job that I see everyone.
Of course. As his new worker,
you should see him.
Don't you think so, Germaine?
Nursery is this way.
He gets the best care
in all the world. We all see to that.
Mm, chocolate!
Mind if I feed him?
Hi, Baby. Are you hungry?
Now, open up. Whoopsie!
Are you hungry?
Are you hungry? Yes! Come on...
You do this every day,
Mrs. Wadsworth?
Have to, or the muscles will go bad.
His legs seem perfectly normal.
I'm surprised he doesn't walk.
You must have, er, quite a few clients,
Mrs. Gentry.
Seems like Baby's one of your favorites.
What gives you that idea?
Well, this is your third time here
in a week.
I guess you're right.
He is of special interest to me.
But then, he's a pretty special baby.
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Foley?
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, please sit down, Ann.
- Thank you.
Oh, I see you've been reading
my Baby file.
Under the circumstances,
I thought it would be best.
What circumstances?
Ann, I've been going through your reports
for the past few weeks.
You're not spending nearly enough time
with your emergency cases.
You've been devoting yourself almost
exclusively to this Wadsworth baby.
Well, maybe I have,
but with very good reason.
Ann, I'm not telling you to drop it.
Just ease off.
Compromise.
Mr. Foley,
this case is full of compromise.
And indifference.
And criminal negligence.
And we're responsible!
Ann, you exaggerate.
Other workers have put time in
on this case,
and they've come up
with no significant results.
None of those other workers spent enough
time on the case to accomplish anything.
- That's not true! One did...
- Yes, one did.
And just when she was beginning
to make progress, she disappeared.
- People drop out of sight. It happens.
- Not very often.
Well, the police looked into it.
They were satisfied.
But I'm not.
Don't let him go too high.
- He might fall out and get hurt.
- You're having a ball, aren't you?
Yeah! Well, I am, too.
You know, he seems so intelligent,
Germaine, so alert.
Maybe, but when you've been
around him some more,
you'll realize how limited he is.
You think so?
- I ought to know.
- Ooh!
I have to clean up after him.
Hey! That was fun, wasn't it?
Let's play another game. I know what.
Let's play with the ball.
Let's play with the ball, yeah.
The ball, yeah! That'll be fun!
Uh-huh? OK.
Get ready. Get ready.
Get ready to catch it.
I'm gonna throw it!
There it goes!
Well, that's a good job!
That's good! That was good! Good boy!
You caught it, didn't you?
Hey, let's try something else. OK?
I'm going to roll the ball...
and I want you to get it!
That's the way!
He's a good Baby! He knows!
Now bring it back to Ann!
He's so smart.
Come on, bring it back to Ann. Please?
Go on! Bring it to me, please! Please.
Bring it to Ann!
Oh, yes! That's a good Baby!
He's such a sweet baby!
Oh...
- Oh, he's a smart baby.
- What's going on?
Oh, I've just been playing
with your brother.
You know, some of his responses
are really surprising.
Any kid a couple of years old can do that,
but he can't do any more.
Well, I'm not so sure.
Alba, isn't it time for Baby's nap?
Mm-hm. I'd better take him inside.
Come on, you.
- He likes you.
- Well, sure.
I like him.
I know somebody
who's not going to like it, not any of it.
Now, come on, let's get inside.
I'm getting sick
of this moth-eaten old thing!
Come on!
Does she mean your mother?
Pay no attention to Alba.
She's always saying dumb things like that.
Now, I'm sure you have other clients to see.
I'll walk you to your car.
Thank you.
You dress so beautifully, Ann.
How do you do it
on a social worker's salary?
Easy. By spending my whole salary!
Of course, you have a husband
to pay all the other bills.
Your husband, tell me, what does he do?
Uh... Roger was an architect.
He, uh... He created some
of the finest buildings in the city.
Did you say "was"?
Ann?
Uh... When was the last time
Baby, uh, had an examination?
Why do we have to talk about Baby
all the time?
We don't.
I'd like to find out more about you.
Well, there's really
not much to find out. I, er...
I lead a pretty conventional life.
Let's see, I live in a nice house
with a marvelous husband,
an understanding mother-in-law.
That's about it.
Do you like physical exercise?
Sometimes.
I love to go hiking up in the mountains.
Do you ever do anything like that?
Unfortunately,
I don't have much free time.
Well, maybe on a Saturday
when you're not working.
Oh, I usually spend Saturdays with Roger.
Besides, I don't think
it would be much fun for you.
I mean, you'd probably wind up
having to carry me!
You never know what you're missing
until you try it.
Well, maybe, but I'm a Scorpio -
we're very cautious.
Bye-bye.
Oh, when was the last time
Baby was examined by a psychologist?
A psychological test to determine
his mental range and physical reactions?
We had all those tests when he was a baby.
But he must have had more tests
since then.
No. There didn't seem to be
any reason for it.
Why'?
Oh, nothing in particular.
It was just a thought.
You know, Scorpios really aren't cautious.
Just dangerous.
Bye-bye.
It's late, Ann.
Don't you think you should go to bed?
Not yet. I want to finish these.
He was so beautiful!
We were so beautiful together.
Why did it have to happen?
I just cannot accept it.
Ann!
I won't let it be this way!
Your son...
Your son was everything to me.
I know.
It should have been me.
It should have been! It was my fault.
No, Billy, you can't come over.
You know about the freak.
They don't like outsiders coming by.
I'd only get in trouble, and you know it.
Is that all you guys ever think about?
A girl likes to feel
like she's something special.
What kind of a question is that?
Of course I'm wearing panties.
Don't I always?
Oh, cut it out!
Well, I should be off around midnight.
I suppose I could drop by your place
on the way home.
Listen, I have to go see about the baby.
Oh, he's not so bad,
once you get used to him.
Yeah, alright!
Just for you, I'll make sure they're off.
Alright! I'm coming!
What's the matter, sweetheart?
Did you have a bad dream? You OK?
Oh, well, you got a wet diaper. No wonder.
OK. We'll feel so much better
in a minute. Yes, we will.
OK.
Let's get rid of this nasty old diaper.
OK? Put some powder on it.
Oh, that'll be so nice.
OK? There we go.
That feels so much better, doesn't it?
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that wonderful?
We like that, don't we?
There.
OK. Goodnight, sweetheart.
Goodnight.
No, no, no, no, Baby. No, no.
On, Baby!
No, no, no, no.
It's time to go to sleep.
Come on. Come on, now.
Lay down here.
Lay down! Come on, now.
What is the matter? What do you want?
Oh, I'm sorry. You can't get out.
Come on, Baby. Alright...
Alright. Alright.
Just for a little while, though, OK?
OK. Come on. Here we go.
OK. That a boy. There we go.
OK.
Baby! No, no, no.
Baby, what are you doing? No.
No, sweetheart.
Come on, let's go play with Teddy.
Come on.
Come on, Baby. Over here.
That's it, Baby.
Right over here, come on.
Oh, Teddy feels so much better!
Isn't he fun?
Oh, I know! Go get him!
Come on.
Go get the Teddy!
Oh, sweetie. Let me see!
Let me see it. Let me see it. Oh!
Oh, sweetheart. Let me kiss it.
We'll make it all better.
Yes, we will.
Are you hungry? Let me get you a bottle.
OK?
No! No, Baby. No.
Baby, no! Don't.
Baby, let me get you a bottle.
Baby! Baby?
Don't, Baby.
Baby, don't. Don't. Baby.
Baby. Baby.
Oh, that's funny!
Oh, why does that babysitter
always have to leave this damn TV on?
Mama, I ate too many egg rolls!
You're always making
a little piglet out of yourself.
- Where is she?
- Probably upstairs with Baby.
Hey, we came back just in time
not to pay her extra!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
We were just fooling around.
Nothing really happened, honest.
Nothing happened?
With your damn tit in his mouth
and you call that nothing?
- You lying bitch!
- You have to believe me!
We never did anything.
You lying bitch!
You bitch!
Get away from me!
He's a baby
and you had to put your hands on him.
You want kicks?
Well, I'll give you kicks!
Please!
OK, Mama. Baby's watching this.
Let her go.
Get her out of here before I kill her!
If you tell anybody about this
we'll press charges.
You were abusing a mental case
and it's a criminal offense.
Do you understand?
Baby, Baby. Don't cry.
Hello, Alba.
Is your mother inside?
Off playing bridge again?
Every Tuesday and Thursday,
but I think you know that by now.
Do you mind if wait for her?
Suit yourself.
Hi! Hi, how are you?
Hey!
Look what I got. See?
It's a tiger. Yeah.
It's a tiger! Yeah!
You like it?
Yeah, yeah, you like it, don't you?
Yeah!
I don't think you like me very much.
- I don't know you.
- Well, you could get to know me.
Actually, I'm a very easy person to know.
I'd like to be your friend, Alba.
In a way, there's more to it than that.
I really need your friendship.
Why'?
You know how much
I want to help your brother.
So?
I can't do it without the cooperation
and support of the whole family.
Has anyone been giving you any trouble?
No!
But that's not the same as having
your complete trust and confidence.
Baby was born backwards.
He's been that way all his life.
That's all there is to it.
Stop that, Baby,
or I'll have to punish you!
- How do you punish him?
- When he's bad, he gets a spanking.
I think he's just hungry.
I know he's hungry.
How dumb do you think I am?
But I have to wait for Mama to get back.
Why don't you get him a bottle?
I'll keep an eye on him.
I'm sure you would,
but I'm not supposed to leave him alone.
Well, he wouldn't be alone. I'd be here.
You did say your mother
was coming home soon.
Mm-hm. You'd better wait.
Mama wants to see you
as much as you want to see her.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Guess I'll have to.
Hey', Baby. Hey.
Yes, it must get lonely in there
all by yourself.
I bet you'd like playmate, wouldn't you?
Yes, you would.
Let me be your playmate.
Yes, thank you. Yes!
Let's try something
more grown-up today, OK?
You're a bright fella, anybody can see that.
You wanna try to stand up?
Yeah! Wanna stand up?
Want to try? Give me your hands.
Give me your hands. That's my boy!
That's my boy!
UP We go!
OK, hold on.
Come on. Let's try it. Up.
That's right! That's right!
QOpS!
But that was good! Yeah!
It was fun, wasn't it? Yeah!
Let's try it again.
Let's try it.
You just trust me.
I won't let you fall.
Let's go. Up! Good!
- That's right. Hold onto me.
- Mrs. Gentry!
Just what do you think you're doing?
Just trying to test his balance
and coordination.
Yeah, well you shouldn't be trying
anything with him. He's much too delicate.
And you had no business
leaving him alone!
Phone rang,
and I thought it might be important.
Nothing's that important.
I didn't mean any harm, Mrs. Wadsworth.
I just want to help Baby
reach his full potential.
Are you sure that's all you want,
Mrs. Gentry?
What more could there be?
Baby's happyjust like he is.
He loves being a baby.
NOb0dy's asking for your opinion,
young lady.
Give me the bottle
and get back in the house.
Let's you and I have a little talk,
woman to woman.
- Do you have any children, Mrs. Gentry?
- No, unfortunately.
Well, I've raised three children,
and believe me, I ought to know
what is best for my own child.
Oh, I'm sure you do.
Mrs. Wadsworth,
if I could convince you that Baby
is capable of growth and development,
you wouldn't stand in his way, would you?
Of course not. What mother would?
Well, then, I think you should consider
putting Baby into a special clinic
for the retarded.
A clinic? You mean like a hospital?
Oh, no. Not like a hospital.
It's a day clinic.
More like a school, where Baby could be
with other young people like himself.
It's really the best way.
Maybe the only way.
Well, I never thought about it,
but I don't think it would work.
Why not?
A lot of reasons.
It'd put a real hardship on the family.
Besides, I don't drive a car.
But that's no problem!
I could take Baby to the clinic for you.
You mean take him there by yourself?
I'd be happy to. It's part of my job.
No.
Nobody takes my Baby anywhere
without me.
I only thought...
Well, maybe you think too much.
When it comes to Baby,
I do all the thinking.
I see.
Besides, we...
we could never afford
anything like a... a clinic.
But you could, Mrs. Wadsworth.
For someone like yourself,
these places are cost-free.
What about the cost to us
in heartache and disappointment
when it all comes to nothing?
But we still have to try!
Just give your son a chance,
and I know he won't disappoint you.
- Are you that sure of yourself?
- Yes.
Well, I'm willing to keep an open mind.
Show me! Show me why you think
Baby has a chance.
But I'm no therapist.
Well, I'll make allowances for that.
Show me.
Alright.
Baby! Baby!
Come on. That's a boy. Come on.
Yeah, come on!
What do you do with the ball?
You remember the ball!
Now, come on out.
Come on out. That's a boy!
That's a good boy!
Okey doke. Come on.
Come on up here.
Yeah! We're gonna play with the ball!
We're gonna play with the ball!
Look at the ball.
I'm gonna throw the ball!
See the ball? It's fun.
There it goes!
Now, get the ball, Baby.
Go on, you remember!
You remember! It's fun!
It's fun! It's fun!
Get the ball! Get the ball!
That's the way.
Get the ball and bring it back.
Get the ball and bring it back, Baby.
That's the way!
Get the ball and bring it back, Baby.
Baby, bring the ball back!
Bring it back! Baby?
Bring it back! Baby?
You call that progress?
Even a dog can do a trick like that.
That's my failure.
Mrs. Wadsworth, don't make him pay
for my inadequacy.
Well, I'm not making any promises.
But I will think about what you said.
You won't be sorry.
- Bye.
- I'll call you.
Mama!
Damn you!
Get inside!
Baby doesn't walk!
And Baby doesn't talk!
And Baby doesn't stand!
Baby doesn't walk!
And Baby doesn't talk to strangers!
Alba! You've punished him enough!
If you use this thing on him, you'll cripple him!
- It's better than using a belt, Germaine!
- I ain't used it in two months!
He has to be disciplined or else he'll
do things he shouldn't and hurt himself!
You'll end up killing him.
When he's naughty,
it's the best way to teach him obedience.
Don't kill him!
You know Mama doesn't want him to
stand up and he shouldn't trust strangers!
Baby doesn't stand
and that's what keeps baby safe!
Stop it! He's your brother, not an animal!
Argh!
Maybe that'll teach you some discipline.
Now, just get him in the closet.
Get him in the closet!
Yes, Mama.
Mama!
I hope you had a chance
to look over Baby's file.
Yes, I have.
Ralph, what do you see?
I know you'll agree
with my recommendation.
What's your special interest in this case?
Can you think of anything more horrible
than being buried alive?
Well, that's what happened
to this client.
He's been imprisoned
by a kind of sick love.
There's a normal, full-grown man -
trapped, with no way out.
There's something here I don't understand.
If he isn't seriously retarded,
then how do you account for the fact
that he can't walk or talk?
Negative reinforcement.
Some kind of consistent punishment
to discourage him from normal learning.
That's a pretty serious charge.
Well, they're a pretty strange family -
especially the mother.
Each child is by a different man,
and all of them abandoned her.
Now, the last one she was married to,
Baby's father,
and I think when he left,
she just never got over it.
So she's taking revenge
on the only male member of the family.
Well, that might be a partial answer,
but there's probably more to it
of a pathological nature.
Ann, if you're convinced
Mrs. Wadsworth is an unfit mother,
you should turn the case over
to the Public Guardian.
I thought of doing that,
but I'm hoping I won't have to.
Suppose it's necessary?
Well, I know enough about them,
more than enough,
but to prove it with solid evidence,
no chance.
I just don't understand it!
They should have been here
over half an hour ago.
- Maybe they misunderstood you?
- No!
I was very precise about the time
and the place.
- May I?
- Of course.
Hello?
'Germaine? This is Ann Gentry.
I'm here at the clinic with Dr. Sutton.
- 'Is Baby on the way over?'
- We're not going there today.
'Why not?'
Mama changed her mind.
She changed her mind.
Germaine, I'd like to speak
with your mother, please.
She doesn't want to speak to you.
'Have you talked
to your supervisor today?'
No. Why?
Maybe you should.
Without their cooperation,
there isn't much you can do.
We'll just see about that.
- Mr. Foley, extension 360, please.
- Ann.
I think you should forget this case.
What about Baby?
What's going to happen to him?
- Ann...
- Mr. Foley, this is Ann Gentry.
Germaine Wadsworth suggested
that I call you.
What kind of complaint?
Surely, you don't believe
all that garbage?
Yes, but...
But...
But Mr. Foley,
can't we at least talk about this?
- 'I'm telling you to drop it.'
- Alright, Mr. Foley.
Ann, I'm beginning to worry about you.
That damn woman!
- That whole damn family!
- Ann, I'd like to know what's happening.
So would I.
Well, what the hell
brings you back here again?
I can understand your surprise,
Mrs. Wadsworth.
After going behind my back
and telling ridiculous lies,
you were expecting someone else.
You're damn right!
You're not our worker anymore.
I just wanted to face you one more time
to tell you that you're sick.
You're the one who needs help, not Baby.
OK, you said it.
Now, get off my property.
- She causing trouble again, Mama?
- You keep quiet.
Now you, get away from here,
or I'll call the cops
and have them take you away.
I'm going to fight you, Mrs. Wadsworth,
with the only weapon I have - the law,
for the legal custody of Baby.
Now, you just go ahead and try, honey.
There's an agency
that works to protect people.
It's called the Public Guardian Office,
and you will be hearing from them.
- They can't do anything to us.
- They can investigate everything.
Mrs. Wadsworth, do you think your
treatment of Baby can stand up to that?
That's just so much horse shit.
You want him for yourself.
Well, agency or no agency,
you ain't gonna get him.
Cos Baby belongs to us.
No, to me.
He belongs to himself! He's not
the sub-human thing you've made him.
And once I report what I know,
it's just a matter of time
before Baby is taken away
from all of you.
You damn bitch!
I'll be seeing you, Mrs. Wadsworth -
in court.
Judith? I'm home!
- Judith?
- You're late today.
I know.
- Everything go alright here?
- As usual.
Did you have a hard day, dear?
Oh, my feet hurt!
Among other things.
Did the men do much work here today?
The contractor swore you'd have
the water in by the weekend.
Good.
The sooner the better.
Thank you.
Ann, Mrs. Wadsworth called.
- What did she say?
- You're to call back.
Anything else?
No.
I'll call her right now.
- I'll take it on the extension.
- Good.
Hello?
'This is Ann Gentry.
My mother-in-law said that you called.'
Well, I just wanted to apologize
for all that happened today.
There's really no excuse
for the way we acted.
We're willing to cooperate with you,
if you just give us another chance.
OK. Uh...
'Let's forget about what happened'
and make a fresh start.
Right. So there's no reason
to bring in the Public Guardian.
Maybe not.
We'll have to see about that.
'Suppose we...'
meet tomorrow sometime at my office?
Well, I have an idea.
Baby's having a birthday party tomorrow.
Come then.
Well, I appreciate the invitation,
Mrs. Wadsworth,
'but a party usually
isn't the best time to...'
Well, that way, you can also see Baby
in a real family situation.
It might give you some more ideas
on how to help him.
Alright.
'I'd be happy to come.'
Goodbye, Mrs. Wadsworth.
Goodbye, Mrs. Gentry.
When you do something, Mama,
you sure don't screw around.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, isn't that lovely?
Look at that!
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, everybody gather round now.
Oh, here we go.
Baby's gonna make a wish
and help Mama blow out all the candles.
Come on. One, two, three - blow!
Hooray!
Now, the rest of you
just fend for yourselves.
Go on! Eat up! Have a good time!
Hi. I'd like to pay you
a sincere compliment.
You've got beautiful skin.
Don't tell me you're a dermatologist.
No, just a skin freak!
I'm Dennis.
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I'm alone.
I'm solo, too.
Would you like to go for a ride?
No, thanks. I'm married.
Well, don't let that depress you.
I've got just the cure.
I'm happily married.
Shh! Don't let happiness hear you!
How come your old man
ain't here with you?
He was hurt in an accident.
I see. I see.
And he's still out of action, right?
Are you trying to say something?
Lady, there's only one thing I see
in those big, beautiful cat eyes - hunger.
Buzz off, creep! There's a difference
between hunger and starvation.
Wow! You must be president
of the women's lib.
Next time I'll wear my iron jock.
- One of my sister's many beaus.
- Dennis the Menace.
You need something
to get you in a party mood.
- No thanks. I'm not drinking tonight.
- Why not?
Well, I'd like to be sober
when I talk to your mother.
Maybe you two should get loaded together -
instant communication!
Come on, big sister.
Happy birthday, Baby! And many more!
Hey, you must have really liked your cake!
Yeah!
That's better!
Come on. Give me your hand.
That's a boy.
Having a good time?
We could have that talk now,
Mrs. Wadsworth.
Later. Look!
- This will help you get with it.
- Oh, no, I'm not drinking, thanks.
I would like to talk to you about Baby
before it gets too late.
There's plenty of time for that.
Why don't you just hang loose
and have a good time?
Elliot, let's work out.
- You don't mind, do you?
- Lead the way!
Yes!
Here. I've had it.
- Wanna play?
- Sure.
- Can I play?
- No, Dennis.
You can sit down here
and hold the prize.
You really play to win.
When you're a winner, Alba,
the possibility of losing doesn't even exist.
- I think you're getting old!
- I know, I know I am.
On, Baby!
Hi, Baby.
Baby loves Mama
more than anyone else in the whole world.
- Mama, you're one hell of a woman.
- I'm a mother.
A special kind of mother,
to sacrifice yourself all these years.
Most people think it's pretty sad
having a child like Baby.
And maybe it is.
But it can be a blessing.
Mama, you mean it, don't you?
Gives me something to live for.
No, not something.
Everything-
Anybody can get lucky and win for a while.
I believe in making my own luck.
You know, most children grow up
and they go off on their own.
Well, that's life and it's only natural.
But I find real comfort and joy in knowing
my Baby will never have to face
all that hurt and ugliness out there.
Here, his life is perfect.
HaPPY-
Are you sure this prize is worth it?
It depends on how badly you want it.
Formidable!
Congratulations.
It never happens
when you stay with grass.
Why don't we get her to bed?
She can sleep it off.
I knowjust how to help.
I'll be right back.
That's enough, Dennis.
We can handle this.
Wait for me at the bar.
I'll make it worth your while.
What are you doing?
No. You can't get away with this!
People know I came here.
And people saw you drunk,
and on your way home
you had an accident.
Tie her up and gag her!
Alba, sweetheart!
Come on out of there!
Go away, Dennis.
After you make it worth my while!
Come on out of there
and dance with me.
Alba, will you go up there
and shut that idiot up?
- What were you doing down there?
- Do you want to dance or talk?
Help me!
Baby!
Help me!
Help! Help me get loose!
Help!
- Baby!
- Oh, baby. How bad do you want me?
Oh, I want you a lot!
Will you do it the way I like it?
- Oh! Does a cannibal eat raw meat?
- OK, cannibal.
Let's test your appetite.
Will you beg for it?
Crawl for it?
Cry like a little puppy dog in bed?
I've got a better idea!
Give me your lighter.
- What the hell for?
- Just give it to me, OK?
Put your hand in the flame.
You gotta be kidding!
Just one finger -
for one little old minute?
- Alba?
- Uh-huh?
I'll do anything to get to paradise,
but does it have to be in an ambulance?
Just think - what a trip!
_ (BabY be '
9M8 to
Baby, it's OK. It's OK. It's alright.
Just be quiet.
Done it!
I did it!
Only for a few seconds, lover.
Nowhere near a minute.
You little bitch!
Call me tomorrow.
Maybe I'll have some free time.
Yeah, bye! Goodnight, Al!
Come on, Baby. Here we go.
Alba, we're waiting.
Come on, Baby.
Come on. Let's go.
Baby, let's go!
What are you doing?
Now, come on! We have to go.
Come on!
Now, be a good little cannibal and just go
find yourself another midnight snack.
Alba, one of these days you're going
to turn me into a vegetarian.
Uh-huh. Well, bye-bye.
Now...
OK, let's get it over with.
My God! Baby!
She took him!
What the hell? Alba, take a look!
- That tricky bitch!
- She punctured it.
She thinks of everything.
- It's been almost two hours.
- How much longer do we have to wait?
No phone calls. No police.
Nothing's happening.
I'm beginning to understand that girl.
Why wouldn't she go to the police?
Why should she?
She's got what she wants.
- She means to keep him?
- What for?
Bubbles!
- You like the bubbles, don't you?
- Yeah.
Nice to get all clean.
Oh, thank you!
You're a sweetheart, aren't you?
You sure are.
Baby? I have a surprise for you.
Not bad.
I think this will do just fine.
Your first pair of long pants,
and it's about time.
Oh, don't worry, honey.
You'll get used to it.
Oh, yes. Poor Baby.
Mama?
Mama?
- Mama.
- What is it?
Well, your bridge group's
on the phone.
They want to know
if you're available.
No, tell them when I'm feeling better.
And if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.
Mama?
It isn't worth it.
We should have let them take him.
Alba, you're not talking about
that circus?
Mm-hm.
They wanted to put him in a side show.
We should've said yes.
Are you calling your brother a freak?
No, Mama.
I just thought it'd be better that way.
She didn't mean it, Mama.
Never!
Never let me hear you say that again.
I'm sorry, Mama.
They're almost finished.
The men are ready to use the gunite.
Tell them to hold off for a few days.
We'll call them when we're ready.
Ann, darling, are you sure
you want to go through with this?
- There's no other way.
- You're not having second thoughts?
Not anymore.
You're not afraid afterwards
that we'll be just like them?
Judith, we could never be like them.
OK.
OK, Baby.
We're going to take your picture now.
You're going to like that.
This is going to be
a very special picture.
But you have to stand up
straight and tall like a big man.
That's it, give me your hand.
UP you go!
That's a good boy!
You just stand there.
OK, Baby. OK.
Come on, give me a little smile.
Go on! Smile for the camera.
Come on, please?
That's good.
Come on, just a big smile!
Just look at that!
It doesn't even look like him.
"Wadsworth family.
"I am in the process
of making Baby into a grown man.
"As I have always suspected,
"his responses are those
of a sensitive and intelligent person.
"His progress, so far,
proves that beyond a doubt.
"In a short time, the Baby you once knew
will no longer exist.
"Even if circumstances beyond my control
force him to return... home...
"...it will be too late
to reverse his transformation.
"Your Baby is lost to you forever."
Good Samaritan!
What a lie!
We've got to get him back
before it's too late.
Just tell us what you want, Mama.
We'll do it.
First, we have to find her.
That's her car.
Look around, girls.
If you see any signs of Baby,
don't go in there.
Suppose we know he's in there for sure?
Then we'll all go in together.
I expect you back in five minutes.
Both of you.
Quiet, Baby.
Alright. You asked for it.
Germaine?
Germaine?
Germaine?
Germaine?
Alba?
Germaine?
Alba?
Germaine!
Oh, my baby!
Germaine!
Germaine!
- Mama?
- Alba.
Mama.
Alba!
Oh, my God!
Alba!
Alba!
Oh, my legs!
Oh, they're broken. I can't move!
We've got her now.
No, wait!
It's better this way.
Get some rope to tie her hands.
You killed my daughters.
You killed them.
My Baby!
What have you done to my Baby?
Why do you want my Baby?
Why do you want him?
Now what's going to happen to my Baby?
What's going to happen to him?
You won't harm him?
Tell me, I have to know!
- What's going to happen to my Baby?
- Nothing!
You won't harm him.
You want to have him.
We'll love, cherish and protect him.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You bitch! You murdering bitch!
Bitch!
Oh, my girls!
Oh, my girls!
Alright, Baby. Had enough?
Gonna be good?
OK. Come on.
- How do you feel?
- Fine. I'll make some coffee.
Good.
Come on.
Where's my best worker?
There he is!
Are you putting up a new building?
Hi! Were you lonely all by yourself
last night, sweetheart?
I know. Wifey loves
her big baby husband, yes.
Hey. Look who's here. Look!
It's your playmate. He's come back!
And now he can stay with you always.
Come on. Come on, Baby.
Say hello to Roger. Yes!
You two like each other, don't you?
Oh, yes!
Oh, my two big men!
Waitjust a minute.
We'll save some for later.
Surprise!
Look what I've got!
One for Baby, and one for Roger!
These are great fun!
These are for our brand new pool!
And just as soon as it's filled,
we're all going to go in it...
