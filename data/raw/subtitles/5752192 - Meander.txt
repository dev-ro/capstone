I don't know, man,
I saw it like I see you.
It was a huge object,
like a bright light.
Stayed in the sky, not moving.
Hallelujah, and never forget,
always listen
to the voice of the Lord.
The two girls were stabbed
two hours apart,
and their attacker
fled the scene
before the police arrived.

Are you okay?
I'm lost.
Well, it sure seems that way.
If you like, I could
drop you off somewhere.
- I'm good.
- You sure?
We're literally
in the middle of nowhere.
I'm fine, I'll walk.
Suit yourself, but it's
a good six or seven miles
to the nearest gas station.
At least it's simple.
Just keep going straight.

What do you do for a living?
Waitress. Kitts Rock.
I know that place,
it's a cool bar.
I suppose.
You?
I'm a night watchman.
The most boring job
in the universe.
But, you know,
it pays the bills,
and no one is there
to hassle me.
I, uh, I don't like people.
I know how you feel.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm Adam.
Lisa.
I like your accent.
Europe?
France.
Cute.
So are you here
on a holiday or...
Are you a night watchman
or a cop?
I'm sorry.
Crying is for kids and losers.
The asshole
who called himself my dad
always used to say that to me.
Difficult childhood?
Oh, you have no idea.
No idea.
Well, that's one thing
we have in common.
You have kids?
Today's my daughter's birthday.
- How old is she?
- Nine.
She would have been nine today.
Is that why you were
laying in the road?
I don't want to die.
I just want to see
my daughter again.
There's nothing after this.
We're all alone.
All the time.
The suspect has not yet
been formally identified,
and the police have confirmed
that the two murders
that took place this morning
are linked.
The suspect is a white male
with short hair.
He has a tattoo of a cross
on his right hand
and was last seen
driving a brown truck.
The bodies of the victims
were covered with terrible...
MEANDER
Ah.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Oh! No, no, no, no!
Fuck, what is this?
What the hell is this?
No, no.
No.
No!
I can't.
I just want to go home.
Hey.
Is someone there?
Oh, shit. Shit!
Okay.
No!
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't take it anymore.
I can't... I can't do it.
- Hey.
- Come here, I'm here!
Ah! Oh! Oh!
Okay.
I'm almost there.
Come here!
Please!
Come here!
Help me!
Hey!
Help me, please!
Help me.
- Hey.
- Help!
Help.
I can't get through.
- We're stuck.
- Help me!
We have to stay calm
and find a solution.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm s... so sorry.
It's okay.
It's not your fault.
We haven't done anything.
Hey! Look at me.
I haven't gone through
all this shit to give up now.
Whoever put us in here
wants us to die like rats.
We have to help each other.
Right?
Please help me.
What is there on your side?
On my side?
Nothing!
The tube! The fucking tube!
That's what's on my side!
Just tube!
You've been here for longer
than me, right?
I've got to be quiet.
Shh.
You remember anything?
They're gonna come back.
They're gonna kill you.
Who?
Who is they?
Oh, we're gonna die,
we're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Oh, we're gonna die!
We're gonna die.
Oh, we're gonna die!
You're gonna die!
You're gonna die, you bitch!
Get out, bitch!
Get out!
No!
Look out!
You're gonna die, you bitch!
My hand!
My hand!
You cut...
Adam.
No.
Why are you doing this?
No! Arrêt!
You don't want me to die.
A diamond, a cross, a diamond.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What was it?
Diamond, cross, diamond.
Diamond...
It's her.
I know it's her.
Nina?
Nina?
Papa.
It's me. I remember that.
Nina?
Nina!
No...
I'm sorry.
I wasn't there.
I wasn't there for you.
Stop.
Let me go.
Let me be.
Let me be.
Wait.
Left, right, right, left,
left, right. They're arrows.
It's under my bracelet.
Won't you help me take it off?
It needs to work.
Right, left, right, left, left,
right. Right, left, right,
left, left, left, right.
Alright, I need to go right.
Left.
Right.
Right, left, right, left, left.
Shit.
Mom?
Where were you?
Why did you leave me all alone?
Don't you love me anymore?
I'm so sorry.
Don't cry, mom.
We'll stay together.
- We'll stick together.
- Yes.
Forget about time, mom.
Come.
Come with me.
Come, mom, follow me!
- It's this way.
- No. Wait.
What's wrong, mom?
I don't want to lose you.
But you're not real.
Mom.
Mom!
Mom, stay with me!
Mom, stay with me!
Forget about time!
Mom! Mom!
This is my way.
That's where I need to go.
I can't come with you.
Does it mean we're never
going to see each other again?
I'm proud of you, Lisa.
We all are.
I made it.
"Forget about time."
I don't need you anymore.
Two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three...
One, two, three...
It's impossible!
One, two...
One, two...
I did everything
you wanted me to do.
I had no chance.
But I made it to the end.
I did it. I did it.
I did it.
Did I die?
Your body did. Many times.
But there's nothing left to fear, now.
You're safe, here.
What do I have to do?
Live.
