Whoops.
My bad.
I want to let you rest, but it seems like we don't have the time for that.
The forces have made contact with the targets.
That's right.
Rude and the others, head straight for the scene as planned.
The rest of you, head back to Headquarters for now.
About the targets' current location...
Like an average soldier can take me on.
Right?
There they are!
What a bunch of persistent guys.
Like it'll hit me.
72 hours ago...
We, the Investigation Sector of the General Affairs Department, alias Turks,
were ordered to pursue the samples that\nhave escaped out of Shin-Ra's facility.
The samples that escaped were two fully grown males.
One of them is an expert in combat, who\nwas once ranked as a SOLDIER 1st Class.
I have been involved with these two guys who are my current\n targets, from the incident that occured five years ago.
If that incident from five years ago never existed,
it is more likely that their fate wouldn't have been changed.
Only if that man never existed...
The ultimate soldier that was once known as a hero...
Sephiroth...
W-Why are you guys... doing a thing like...
I'll go pick you up now...
Father, where are you?!
If you're there, please respond! Father!
It's Master!
Master!
Tifa! What are you doing here?! Get out of here now!
What on earth is going on?
Why did things turn out like this...?
It seems like Sephiroth was behind all this.
Huh? Sephiroth...?
Impossible...
Why would Sephiroth do a thing like this?
Master, have you seen my father?
He's nowhere to be found!
Your father was at the Mako Reactor in the mountains...
D-Don't go...!
Sephiroth is in the mountains...
Are you all right?
Hey! Hang in there! I'm getting some...
Wait, Tifa!
You can't do anything even if you go!
TIFA!!!
Targets confirmed! Targets confirmed! Currently at point 137.
Repeating: Currently at point 137.
Geez, making a big fuss over just the two of us.
Well then...
What should we do now?
We're in each other's line of fire! We're shooting each other!
Engage this situation with close combat weapons!
He's strong...!
So this is the strength of a SOLDIER...
P-Pursue him!
To think that he would abandon his friend.
SOLDIER 1st Class.
Zack...
Hey geezer!
Oh, it's you! You better be sane!
Like I could stay sane in a situation like this.
Sephiroth...did this, right?
People have called him a hero and such in society...
But, he's just a homicidal maniac!
How cruel...
What happened to you Sephiroth?!
Oh yeah! You go on and rescue Tifa!
Did something happen to Tifa?
She headed for the Mako Reactor in the mountains in search for her father.
That Sephiroth is there too.
What?!
That girl won't have a chance against him.
His opponent has to be a SOLDIER like you--
I'm not an ordinary SOLDIER.
What?
I'm a SOLDIER 1st Class.
You go and help the geezer out.
Yes, sir.
I'll head there as soon as possible too. I'll leave Tifa to you.
Leave it to me.
The Turks, huh.
Target sighted. Our order is to seize or terminate the targets, but...
Bring him back in a living state as possible as you can.
Roger.
Surrender quietly. If you do, we will assure you your life.
Those Turks... making an appearance out of\nnowhere and doing as they please.
We will secure the sample ourselves.
Every one of them, doing things as they please...
I don't need an assurance of my life.
What I want...
IS FREEDOM!!
What is it?
Father!
Where are you, Father?
Father!
Hang in there, Father!
Tifa...
Father!
Tifa...
Run away... now...!
Hey! Hang in there, Father!
Sephiroth, right?
Sephiroth did this to you, right?
Sephiroth...
SOLDIER...
Shin-Ra...
Mako Reactor...
I hate... I hate it all!
Mother...
I came to see you...
Sephiroth!
How dare you do this to Father!
How dare you do this to everyone in the village!
In spite of you promising me that...
you would come when I'm in a pinch...
Cloud...
Hurry it up! Still?!
What is it?
The target has acquired a bike.
The enlargement of the escape scope hereafter is expected.
Y-You're... Zack...!
Sorry for keeping you waiting, Cloud.
Hey, don't be so angry.
There's no way that I would ever leave my friend behind.
Geez, the military surely likes to give them things uncalled for.
See ya later!
Targets have been lost. They have entered the underground tunnel.
So, they're planning to enter Midgar, huh?
I understand.
Setup posts in the outskirts of Midgar.
Understood.
Tifa...
Tifa..!
Tifa!
Zack...?
Sephiroth did this to you, right Tifa?
Yes...
You guys...
came to this village... just for an investigation, right...?
That's why I guided you guys here...
It was just for that...
But why did it turn out like...
Tifa...
I hate it...
Shin-Ra, SOLDIER, and you too...
I hate it all!
I'm sorry.
I won't ask you to forgive me...
But...
Let me put an end to this.
Mother.
Let's take this planet back together.
I came up with a good plan.
Let's go to the Promised Land...
Mother.
SEPHIROTH!!!
Why did you kill the villagers?!
Why did you hurt Tifa?!
Answer me, Sephiroth!
Mother, those fools came again.
Mother was supposed to become the ruler of this\nplanet with her superior power and knowledge.
But, those fools...
Those worthless fools...
snatched this planet away from you, right Mother?
But, please don't be sad anymore.
Come with me.
We finally meet, Mother...
Sephiroth!
What the hell has happened to you?!
You traitor...!
Sephiroth! And I trusted you!
No... You're not the Sephiroth I once knew!
I was the chosen one.
I am the chosen existence that is to become this planet's ruler.
In order to return this planet from you fools to the hands of the Cetra's,
I was born.
For Mother's sake.
It's all right now, Mother.
Who are you...?
Return my mother... Tifa... and my village!
I... respected you... and admired you, but...!
Y-You bastard...
Tifa!
Cloud... so you really did come for me...
Yeah.
So you kept our promise, huh.
You really came here when I was in a pinch...
I'm sorry. I was a bit late on getting here.
Not at all.
It's fine... Cloud...
Mother.
By the likes of you...
Cloud...
Finish him... off...
By the likes of you...!
SEPHIROTH!!!
Don't push it, kid!
By the likes of you human beings...
You really thought you could defeat me?!
Remember carefully...
My family...
And my home town...
You've done it all right!
I will never... forgive you!
Impossible...
What the hell are you...?
Mother... come to the Promised Land with me...
Sephi..roth...
I just hope that they make it out alive...
This one... take him down to the Shin-Ra Mansion's basement.
Yes, sir.
Sephiroth... you've surely done it this time.
Oh, it's you. Is Mr. Veld doing well?
Yes.
I see. How's the disposal of the village going?
We have already begun the operation.
But, is there really a need to go that far?
Hah! You're still young.
Your opinion and such doesn't matter at all.
Hurry up with the disposal.
Hmm... Just wait a second...
This guy finished him, huh?
Interest... It really is interesting!
I can use him as a new sample.
Leader, we have received a notice that the\ntargets have been trapped at the posts.
All right. I'll be there immediately.
Are we planning to snatch their freedom away from them again?
The targets have passed point 48 just now.
In addition, the bike used has been left behind because it ran out of gas.
It seems that they've hitchhiked in a truck.
Leader has this serious look on his face once again.
We've rescued them five years ago, but they\nwant us to capture them this time, huh?
What a fate.
If you think about it, how pitiful of them.
It makes me want to sympathize with them.
Wow, you guys sure are nice.
Whatever the mission may be, we will always carry it out, that is our job.
Let's go.
Yes, sir.
It's time to go on a sortie.
Hey newcomer, hurry it up.
I'm coming...
Hey...
What are you doing once we reach Midgar?
Well, first of all, we need to get some money, huh.
Hey pops, do you know any business that I'll be able to do?
What are you saying? You need to try out everything while you're still young.
Go through many hardships while you're\nstill young, and find that path of yours.
"Everything", so he says.
Not much of a help, huh?
Oh yeah, that's right!
I have a lot of knowledge and skills that other people don't have, right?
All right, I've made up my mind! I'll open up a business that does everything!
Hey, you... were you listening to anything what I've said?
Troublesome things, and dangerous things... I'm going\nto do everything depending on the reward.
I'm going to make a fortune!
Hey, Cloud...
What are you going to do?
I'm just kidding.
I won't do a thing like abandon you.
We're friends, right?
We're going to open a business that does\neverything. Do you understand, Cloud?
The targets have passed point 12. They are about to enter our firing range.
All right, let's do it.
But, we were told by the Turks to wait for their arrival.
There's no need to let them handle this.
Just fire it.
Hey pops, we're not there yet? This piece of junk...
Take cover!
Cloud, get out of here!
