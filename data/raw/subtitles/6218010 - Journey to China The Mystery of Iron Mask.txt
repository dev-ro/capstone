Far, far away,
in the south of the Heavenly Empire,
there lived the Great Dragon.
His eyelashes went down
deep into the ground
and came back up as beautiful plants,
healing the souls and bodies
of those who suffered.
People called the leaves
of this plant "tea."
The glory of this drink
spread far and wide.
Soon, the Great Dragon
found men to take care of his eyelashes
and preserve
the healing properties of tea.
They were called the White Wizards.
The Great Dragon made a magical seal
and gave it to the wizards
he trusted the most...
the Master and his daughter,
the Princess.
Merchants from all over the world
traded great riches for this tea.
But then, some of the wizards got greedy.
They went to the evil side
to control the Dragon.
These Black Wizards were led
by the Two-Faced Witch.
She raised an ancient army,
and they took the dragon's cave.
To get more tea,
they stopped trimming
the Great Dragon's eyelashes.
His eyes became heavy,
and he fell into a deep sleep.
The White Wizards fought back
to free the Great Dragon,
but the Black Wizards were too powerful.
The evil forces captured
the Master and the Princess.
They then put them into prisons
on opposite sides of the world.
Feeding time, you lazy maggots!
We should hang the half of you lot!
Hands off!
That's not enough for breakfast. Give me...
Sod off! Come late, get nothing!
One... two... three.
All in attendance.
Of course you are! Where would you go?
It's the Tower!
The years fly, but the jokes
are still the same.
We'll never escape this place.
But we won't live long anyway.
Hmm?
How do you survive
if you don't eat anything?
The sun that rises
in the East nourishes me.
Give it to me.
Little birdie, pretty little birdie.
I'll have water, too!
Damn it!
I will tell you where I've hid my treasure
for a tiny piece of this bird.
Please, give it to me!
I've got you, you white little beauty.
You see how easily I caught him?
That's a homing pigeon.
Not afraid of people.
Please, give it to me!
Yeah, I can see what you mean.
I don't understand.
It's... bloody nonsense!
It's a secret code.
It's written backwards.
Backward?
"Dear Miss Dudley,
I'm missing you immensely
and every day I recall your silhouette
in the moonlight.‚Äù
It looks like it's somebody's
private correspondence.
So, you think we still should read it?
Oh, yes, we should!
- Mm.
- So listen.
"Once again I am apologizing
for my sudden departure.
I would never leave you, Miss Dudley,
if not for the disagreement
with your father.
Debauching yourself in your father's
house, and with a common teacher!
I'm not just a teacher.
I'm a bachelor of geography
and cartography!
Set the dogs on him!
Run, darling! I love you!
I love you too, darling! Believe in me!
"Your father, Lord Dudley
was absolutely right."
Your father, Lord Dudley,
was absolutely right.
I have indeed spent all of my fortune.
I've not wasted it, but invested it
in my invention.
I've managed to produce
a revolution in cartography.
With the help of the fifth wheel
of the coach,
I can measure distance precisely.
Meanwhile, the rest of world
is still doing it the old-fashioned way.
My fame reached the Russian tsar,
who ordered me to map the borders
of his European possessions.
Yes, right! I remember him!
The clever scientist!
I met him
during my embassy trip to England.
"I crossed the whole of Europe..."
I crossed the whole of Europe
and after passing over the mountains
of gloomy Transylvania,
I reached the wild forests
of Little Russia.
There, I encountered phenomena
that cannot be explained by science.
It was as if ancient legends and tales
told at night to frighten children
came to life before my eyes.
I saw an ancient creature
with countless eyes.
Its name was Viy.
With a single glance,
it could read your mind
and know your innermost thoughts.
The locals, called Cossacks,
suddenly turned into strange beasts
during their nightly feasts.
And flying monsters could appear
as if from nowhere.
These are the unfathomable
adventures, Miss Dudley,
that I experienced on my way to Moscow.
These strange visions still haunt me,
and it seems they shall haunt me
as long as Il live.
I was certain, dear Miss Dudley,
that a reward from Peter the Great
awaited me in Moscow,
but that is not what happened.
Oh! I brought the map, as we agreed.
Mr. Jonathan Green needs no introduction.
And I am Sasha Menshikov.
All right, follow me.
Maps are delightful objects.
We do appreciate them.
That's wonderful!
We've heard about your fifth wheel,
an original invention.
Such detail!
I've never seen such a detailed map.
Oh, look, my dear Denmark
is here! So small!
And this here is my dear Holland!
- So very small, as well.
- Be careful! My map!
Everything in Europe is small.
Here, Russia, everything is so big.
Hear! As the eagle is our national bird...
none may defecate while in an eagle pose!
I was led to believe that I would have
an opportunity to meet him.
- So where is he?
- What do you mean?
Here he is, simply go and meet him.
That's not him.
Whoa!
Are you certain the one you met was Peter?
Yes.
The First?
The Great?
Music. Everybody, stand up.
Dance! Dance now!
I met him at his embassy.
The court scientist,
Isaac Newton, and myself.
Well, we saw...
You were in Europe!
How could it have been the Tsar?
- Guards, send him to the dungeon!
- My eyes!
Move, pig!
My eyes. My... my eyes.
And these, dearest Miss Dudley,
are my latest tidings.
This shall also be my final letter to you,
as I only have a single pigeon left.
Hmm...
I suppose Mr. Green
requires my assistance.
May I use your feather, Master?
Thank you.
This pigeon is our only chance
to get out of here.
If Miss Dudley loves this Jonathan true,
we can expect to have visitors soon.
Now, the long-barreled musket.
So, shall we close the book...?
- Father! Look at this!
- What?
It's from Jonathan, he's in trouble!
Don't tell me.
From that lunatic scientist
of yours, is it?
Mm, what's he done now?
He's been taken hostage
by a house full of witches?
Father, please stop!
- He is the father of my child!
- I hardly need reminding of that.
- Please, we want to hear more.
- Go and play for a bit.
"Dearest Miss Dudley.
Now, I'm coming to Moscow."
Now, look at this.
It's not Jonathan's handwriting!
"I, the Great Sovereign,
the Tsar of the Great and Small
of White Russia,
to the one who reads this message,
announce that I am held prisoner
in an English dungeon
known as Tower Grey Prison.
I am the one and only rightful ruler
of the Russian lands.
Peter I."
What's this nonsense
about Peter I being in prison?
Is this some secret code of yours, hmm?
I don't understand it myself.
That that womanizing swindler,
Baron Charles Whitworth,
in his role as Her Majesty's ambassador,
is about to embark on a diplomatic mission
to the Russian tsar.
Get the pigeons ready.
They go to Moscow, immediately.
Ambassador of Her Majesty Anna,
Queen of England and Scotland
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.
All my ancestors had beards.
Thank you, boy.
Give this Chinaman 30 lashes,
and then we're sending him off to Siberia.
That's barbarous.
Leave him alone, he's just a boy.
And here is the Englishman.
By the order of His Majesty,
I order you, ignorant peasants,
not to wear beards.
Cut your beards.
Finally, you will live
like civilized people.
- What is happening here?
- Peter's reformations.
Building up a civilization.
I am a subject of Her Majesty,
the Queen of England!
Here he is, and you'll notice,
in perfect health.
Let him go.
Jonathan, you are forgiven
and fully pardoned.
Lord Dudley sent you these pigeons.
I have a great idea.
You could go to the Far East
and chart a new map of our borders.
And listen here. Don't even think
about running off to Europe.
And keep what you see to yourself.
- It's less trouble.
- I'm going East?
Then there's a condition.
I'll need an assistant. I'll take the boy.
- You want this little fool?
- Did you not hear, you brute?
Take him, he is yours.
Let's get you out of this madness.
Once you're free of here,
you can do what you like.
Over here.
Meet the Englishman outside the city.
Make him disappear, and the Chinaman.
You all right?
What's your name?
Cheng Lan.
We're gonna have to get out
of Moscow as soon as possible.
I'm going East,
but it's a perilous journey.
I owe you my life.
I am going to the East as well.
I owe you.
Look, come with me. I need an assistant.
I don't want to bother you.
I'll travel on top... of this carriage.
On top? Uh... right.
Well, then you need this...
and, uh, and this.
Thank you.
- Fancy fur coat here.
- Where is his wallet?
Monster!
They're devils! Run for your lives!
- You all right?
- I'm all right.
Don't worry, boy. You are safe now.
Can you see what I see?
A tiny Kho Tchai.
It cannot be.
Am I drunk?
Tough guy.
I told you to stop tormenting the birds.
Stop!
Come on, you. Out. Out!
Fly safe. Don't even think about it!
My darling Miss Dudley,
it seems that some kind of conspiracy
is going on in Moscow.
The real Peter the Great
never came back from England.
Halt.
Why are you here?
I have an appointment
with the prison chief.
Using my maps,
Lord Menshikov has blocked all the roads.
Until the real Russian tsar
returns to his throne,
I can only go East.
I would like to see Mr. James Hook.
Milady, sorry.
Mr. Hook is temporarily engaged.
What's going on here?
It's a fight with the prisoners.
Is that Mr. James Hook?
I heard he has a savage temper.
At this very moment,
the prisoner is beating Mr. Hook.
Well, it wasn't your day.
It's the only way out of here.
Anyone who can get to the top is free.
Who is next?
It seems the Master's not here.
We must return to China.
Cheng Lan will need our help.
Milady, Mr. Hook is kinder and fairer
than you might think.
Go, go! Go and fight it out!
This man won his freedom
in an honest fight.
Let him go. He is free.
I won't abandon my brothers.
We will fight or leave together.
All right, I respect your choice.
Let them all go.
Blimey!
He really did it!
They were fighting like tigers.
Enough for today. Break down the ring.
Go back and exercise, gentlemen.
Perfect your bodies!
Remember, a healthy body
houses a healthy mind.
Mens sana in corpore sano.
Exercise!
Allow me a moment, miss. This way.
There's a pretty lass.
You're a nice-looking lady.
Such sweet little thing. That's it.
Come on down here.
Come to me, my beauty.
For tomorrow, could you
change your routine?
My right arm
is twice as long as my left.
I'll soon be able to touch the river.
I'll never learn that, Master.
If you don't get it,
you'll wear your mask forever.
You have an influential father,
Miss Dudley.
Otherwise, I would never let
a woman come to this tower.
Please, sit down.
Mm...
I hope you enjoy all the antiques
that I've collected over the years.
Here, this is the helmet of Charlemagne.
And this is my pride and joy... Spartacus.
And here is the sword of king Arthur.
Think about that. King Arthur.
Now, I could go on with this for hours.
What can I do for you, milady?
Mr. Hook...
Um, uh... I have been informed
that one of your prisoners
is the real Russian tsar, Peter I.
He hasn't been able to come home
for many years, and I...
We don't have any tsars
or kings in our prison.
We do have a... a Russian prisoner, yes.
But he's a spy, Peter Mikhailov.
Well, I can show you.
But be very careful, Miss Dudley.
Don't walk any closer
to the prisoners than this line.
They can be very aggressive.
Could you please leave us alone?
I need to speak to them.
Just scream if you need help.
Please!
Let me touch you!
Please, please, just one touch.
Bring your beautiful little ear over here,
and I'll tell you my secret.
It will be our secret.
You're too old to be king.
Please...
You don't look like a Russian.
So, it must be you.
Are you the Russian tsar?
Of course I am. Don't you see that?
My husband's life depends
on you getting your throne back.
He is supposedly in Russia, heading East
with some Chinese boy.
Have you received a new letter?
Here it is.
"My assistant is very young and childlike,
but he has great strength,
courage and unprecedented skills.
I would have taken him
for a girl at first glance,
if I hadn't seen Cheng Lan
with my own eyes
dealing with a whole pack of robbers
in the woods."
Cheng Lan is my daughter.
Daughter?
Cheng Lan is a girl?
Jonathan is traveling with a girl?
I'd never have come here if I'd known.
- He's traveling with a girl.
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, my God!
- Wait! Wait.
It says that he thinks it's a boy.
- Maybe nothing happened yet.
- Yet? Nothing happened?
Can you help us?
Just make sure the gate is open.
Why would I believe you?
My daughter will lead him to China.
Do you really wanna see
your husband alive again?
Of course I do.
It seems that the old man
has already got his freedom.
Good heavens. What happened to him?
Is he dead?
The soul of one of your prisoners
has escaped!
That's impossible.
He's dead indeed.
How peculiar.
Well, at least he died happy.
Why do you think so?
As far as I know,
he hasn't seen a woman in 30 years.
All right, take him out.
One mouth less to feed.
- The gate.
- John, the old man died.
Let's go get him out of here.
Now [I have to tell you,
we do have some impostors
in here.
We have one man who believes
that he's Christopher Columbus.
And another one
who thinks he is Don Quixote.
Oh, think about that.
Stay back.
So now you won't tell us
where the buried treasures are.
This man was like a legend.
He's been here all his life in the Tower.
Oh, shit!
Your hand, Master.
Don't move, or I'll shoot!
There's something happening.
- Oh!
- Raise the ladder!
Take my hand, milady.
Don't move!
Come on, the Dragon Fist!
Whoop, sorry. Go!
Come down.
Please, don't let go of me.
In 500 years, no one has ever escaped.
Go back to your cells.
Do you wanna jump?
Come on, go back to your cells.
Do they think I'm joking?
Stop, or I'll shoot!
Everything is fine, calm down.
- I said, calm down.
- Don't shoot!
I'll deal with them.
You're free, my friends.
Oh, you little prick. Come on, get down.
Master, I'm in trouble!
You want me to hold this?
Oh, you little snake.
- You need to leave now.
- I'm so afraid.
- What are you doing?
- I want to find something.
We don't have time!
That's enough protection,
you're too rough.
That's enough.
Get back.
- What are you looking for?
- A seal.
- This one?
- Like this.
Take that!
- Look up there!
- Don't move.
It's been a while since I had
a sword in my hand.
Hurry up, Master!
Stop!
Stop it!
- You can't stop here.
- I said stop here.
You can't stop here!
Now stay here.
I found it!
Push it harder! Damn it! It's stuck!
Give this to Cheng Lan.
- How will I find her?
- The seal is magic.
If you have it, it can help you.
- I swear to find her.
- Get out of here!
I said you can't stop...
- Over here!
- Faster! Go!
Take aim! Fire!
Stop the carriage!
I've been waiting for this
for a long time.
You will make a fine specimen
in my collection.
- You're a great fighter.
- You're very strong, too.
Just remember, we are still
chained to each other.
So you are not going anywhere.
No one has ever escaped the Tower!
So, I'm going to be the first!
After him, quick! Faster, faster!
You look better this way.
Ah... You look younger.
Hm.... Do I?
No, no! No! Don't touch this.
This is the helmet of Genghis Khan.
Helmet?
Yes.
This is an incense pot.
So stupid.
No!
This is the spear of Alexander the Great.
No, don't touch that one.
No, this is the sword
of the Turkish sultan!
No! No! No!
No, no, no! No, no! No!
So, what should I do?
Good. That's fair.
Damn. Where did you come from?
You won't get away from me that easy!
Gentlemen, please stop now,
or we'll be killed!
Goodness, are you all right?
Can I help you?
- What's going on there?
- He escaped from the Tower.
Hey, big guy. You are only helping me.
You're helping me get down.
Huh?
Not today!
And where is the Chinaman?
You escaped together.
He said he'd bring Jonathan home.
- I'll be doing that for him.
- Sure you can do it?
Yes, I need to return the seal.
I gave him my word.
Give it back here, sir.
Are you going to China?
Hey! Take me with you.
Hey!
Get out of my way.
A Russian ship, we're in luck!
- Where is it headed?
- To China.
- And who are you?
- Are you blind?
Why I don't remember you?
Throw it near the barrels.
Put the grain barrels
at the stern, by the water barrels.
Move faster. A tortoise
could do it quicker'n you.
- Oh, hey there, darling. Oh!
- Don't touch me!
Take your hands off me!
Excuse me, ladies, could you tell me
how to book passage on the Russian ship?
This is the Russian ship.
Stop it! Stop it!
- Get off!
- Get away!
We don't need you around here!
- Get out!
- What are you doing?
- You've had enough!
- I'll go when I damn well please.
Ladies, I'll be sailing soon.
So, I'll need something to drink
and someone pretty to share it with.
Well, it looks like I have no choice.
That's a ruble. I could buy a fine mare
in Moscow for that.
Hey, Russian!
- Mm?
- Mm?
Will you take me to your ship?
A woman on a ship means trouble.
- I'm in a hurry.
- I'm in a hurry, too.
Quickly then. Let's go.
Hey!
Where is the captain's
case of whiskey?
And who are you?
This gentleman hired us.
Yes, let them through.
What's that?
Stop. This is mine.
Come with me, sir.
Where are you going?
Come back here!
Stop! And put it down.
- Is this single malt?
- Yes, sir.
- So you know your whiskeys, do you?
- Yes, I do.
Makheev, are you sure this is the captain
who will take us to China?
Pour me.
It's written all over his face.
- Appreciate.
- "World cruise."
Now you.
I found him at the port tavern,
haunt of all the old sea dogs.
Cast off the lines, you landlubbers!
Clear the moorings!
Stop! You forgot me! Stop!
I want a view of Russia!
You forgot me! Don't leave me here!
Wait! Wait!
Sail on.
Faster! Spread the sails!
Let's see how you train this time around.
Dear Miss Dudley,
I proceed on my journey to the East.
The longing in my heart for you
grows with the distance between us.
My way is filled with dangers
and leads me anywhere but home.
Now we are crossing the Baikal,
the most beautiful lake
in the entire world.
I leave Russia heavy-hearted.
The future of this country
without the real Peter the Great
is gloomy and unknown.
What's the captain's name?
And which port does this ship belong to?
What did you drink,
Captain Scarecrow, huh?
The bucket is used for completely
different purposes on this ship.
How dare you laugh, dirty servants.
- Kneel before your Tsar.
- What?
And you, call the captain.
He's right here.
- Where?
- Here.
Where? I don't see him.
Here!
- What is it?
- Where the heck is he from?
Ah, figures!
Throw this trash in the hole.
And you are...
Well done. Smack on the gob.
Boatswain, there's a storm up ahead!
Captain, look over there.
There's a storm coming!
Take command.
Lower the topsail and the topgallant sail!
Raise the headsail!
Move faster!
You're all moving like tortoises.
A woman!
- Lady's bloomers?
- A woman!
Everybody search!
Here. Check all the cabins. Go!
Ha! Let's find her!
Looks like the captain's
assistant is a girl!
- Help me!
- What are you doing here?
The London police were looking for me
because of you.
Give me the keys.
Don't touch me!
Hey, stop it!
Or I'll show you the Dragon's Fist punch!
Hold on tight!
Everybody! On deck!
Where's the captain?
Oh, God Almighty,
with your Heavenly power,
help me overcome this storm.
Rocks ahead!
Oh, Lord!
- I'll go between!
- We can't, can we?
Zhong Zhe, hold on!
I see the light!
Well, everyone alive?
I don't see the captain.
What is it? Who is there?
‚ô™ Yo-ho-ho
and a bottle of... whiskey! ‚ô™
Oh, he's alive.
The storm has its perks!
It tipped the bottle right over
into my mouth,
and gave me a snack!
Lock him up.
- And no more whiskey for him.
- Hey! What are you doing?
Hey, put me down,
or I'll throw you to the sharks!
Three cheers to the Tsar! Hurrah!
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!
I've never seen
such seamanship.
Only Peter I could have saved us.
Dear Miss Dudley,
I miss the touch of your gentle hands.
I often recall the quiet evenings
we shared in England,
when you and I, alone,
would study geography.
They were, in a word, magical.
My journey follows the Silk Road.
Once it was the whole world's
primary trading route.
Soon, we will see the Great Wall of China.
I wish you could stand next to me
as we see this wonder of the world!
My assistant has stayed on the roof
of the carriage the entire way.
Despite my efforts, I have not managed
to persuade him to come down
and ride in the carriage with me,
where it's comfortable.
The boy is strangely unyielding.
It's the last of the water, Cheng.
Here, take it.
- No, thanks.
- Take it!
We have crossed the whole of China
to reach Cheng's village.
There, on the edge
of the Celestial Empire,
is a port where merchants
from all over the world sail to buy tea.
If I am fortunate,
I'll find a British ship there.
My village has changed.
I don't recognize it anymore.
There are dark clouds over Dragon Cave.
And there's a fortress wall
that wasn't there before.
- What can you see?
- Oh, God, Cheng!
There-there are soldiers
beating up the farmers.
Come! Look!
Something is very wrong.
My people are suffering.
- I must help save them!
- I'm sick of this!
Let's find another port.
There's nothing but trouble there.
Let's turn the carriage around
and go the other way.
But I cannot leave.
I am the true Princess.
Goodbye, dear Jonathan.
That tofu we took...
- Should we get more today?
- Of course.
Buy some tea? Half-price today.
We sell our tea for a pittance
to pay the Princess' taxes.
We can't go on like this!
Shh. Be quiet.
They have ears everywhere.
- No, no. Cheaper.
- That's my lowest price.
Half that price. I will take everything.
Fine, sold.
- Deal.
- Did you all hear that?
He bought all the tea.
We'll eat meat tonight!
Here, quickly!
Hurry, hurry! Quickly! Here!
Make way!
Spread out! Surround the square!
Filthy peasants. Pay the gold and be gone!
We do so much for you,
begging to the Dragon not to be angry
and to grant us the Healing Tea.
Please accept this, Lord Treasurer.
Hm?
Play on.
Gold... Where did you hide the gold?
Just hand it over
if you value your own homes.
You know, the tea isn't what it was.
My customers spill out
most of what they buy.
Hm?
That's all I have.
And this... what is this?
You thought you could even
shortchange us, imbeciles?
You stupid nitwits still don't understand
that we have magical powers
to always know what is real gold.
These tricks with iron
won't work on us, you buffoons.
Ah, and who do we have here?
How long?
For how long are you going to rob us all?
The tea has lost its power!
You'll make us all sick!
- Please, don't.
- Oh!
So we have a rebel on our hands.
Arrest him. The Dragon
will deal with him tomorrow.
What are you doing?
What are you doing? No!
Stop, no! Stop! Grandpal
Let him go!
Oh...
Got you. How could you? You traitor.
The moon has come down to the earth!
Happiness has graced our village!
You've finally returned!
Li Hu, you have to leave.
It's too dangerous.
Get down!
It hurts! Oh, Princess,
I've seen the error of my ways!
I saw you robbing these people.
Whatever happened
to being a White Magician?
You swore to serve the people
and the Great Dragon.
- Princess, what are you doing here?
- Li Hong?
Do you think you can
walk around unrecognized?
You are my friend.
I don't want to fight you.
Why are you torturing us like this?
Left, right, left, right.
Princess!
Princess. Here you go.
This is all for you.
My Moon. Oh, my Sun.
- I think I saw her.
- Who?
- The real Princess.
- What?
So did you, or did you not
see the Princess?
I'm not sure if it's really her.
Oh, Great Sovereign of the Lands.
You are the sun.
I mean the moon, mm...
Shut your mouth.
Get off!
Gather the people, immediately,
and make everyone see
that the Dragon obeys me!
I'll have to put on that vile mask
of her face again.
Such a shame to hide my beautiful face.
Yes, Princess. So pretty.
Soon the time will come
when I finally recover the Dragon Seal,
and show them all my true face.
Allow me to introduce the Princess,
the true beauty,
and great ruler chosen by the Dragon.
She is always delighted to greet
and welcome the foreign guests.
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Jonathan Green.
I'm a scientist and a cartographer.
I draw maps of the places
that I've visited.
Here you go, my Princess.
- Mm?
- Oh...
This map shows the lands
all the way from here to Europe.
We could ship our tea there
by land, not just by sea.
What is the purpose of your visit?
Um, I took a detour from my journey
to see your famous Dragon.
Are you the legendary
princess of the White Wizards,
and the keeper of the secret
of the Healing Tea?
Yes, I'm the Princess,
the Master of the Dragon.
Uh...
I have an assistant, Cheng Lan. He has a...
He has a remarkable resemblance to you.
I mean, you could be twins.
It's uncanny.
You're not related, are you? Hm?
Indeed...
We do look alike.
Can we show him the Dragon?
Hm? Hm?
The Witch has taken your appearance.
Everyone thinks she is the chosen one.
She forces the Dragon to execute people.
If the Master has the Dragon Seal,
how are they able to control him?
Look, isn't that you?
Now I understand why the overseas sculptor
made a bust of me.
They used it as a cast.
Kho Tchai? What are you doing here?
Where's Jonathan?
Jonathan Green. He is my friend.
We have to warn him
that he's in danger.
Today we are blessed on Earth.
Our lovely Princess,
beautiful as the moon,
comes down on Earth
to bless us today
with her pearly, glowing,
bright countenance.
And now, you'll be forever so grateful!
Behold!
This witch has been lazy
and failed to pick
her quota of tea leaves.
Surely, she can work better,
and is worth keeping alive.
But her fate may only be
decided by one will...
the Dragon!
Sorry.
Be careful,
you're in mortal danger.
We need a map
of the palace to save you.
As an Englishman,
grateful to his gracious hosts,
I wonder, would the Princess be interested
in me making a detailed map
of the kingdom?
You may commence work
at your convenience.
Well, I suggest
we commence immediately.
Hm...
She has everyone fooled.
It looks like she's using
the ancient magic,
but that isn't the real
Dragon Seal at all.
Oh, great Dragon!
Save my grandfather!
Grandpa!
What's happening? What is this?
How is this possible?
How could she force
the Dragon to do this?
This place is no different
from a prison.
Once you come to this village,
you can never leave again.
We've tried to handle the guards,
but the Dark Wizards are helping them,
so it's useless.
Sister, are you hurt?
This girl's grandfather
was executed today,
her mother was sold into slavery.
Here.
Please, don't cry.
I promise, we'll get your mother back.
Do you know the "Dragon Song?"
Sing it for me.
Silence! Enough singing!
You will sing a different song
on the plantations tomorrow.
And left.
Frightening, but quite impressive.
These are Russian traders,
here to buy our tea.
They want to buy
all the tea in the village.
Let them in.
Oh, thank you.
Please come. This way.
Oh, finally, ground.
I'd love to eat something
as long as it's not seafood.
Scorpions! Live scorpions!
So delicious!
Live scorpions! Try some.
Uh, I'm not really hungry.
Thanks!
Try this tea.
Mm... Hm?
Why are you doing this?
I'm looking for the Princess.
Look, he has the Dragon Seal.
Sister, I saw the Dragon Seal!
Some foreigner has it!
He's with the guards!
A-mazing.
This isn't magic. It's just science.
Well, I'm wondering
if you have forgotten
that you promised me
to search for my husband.
Well, I would really appreciate it
if you could stay focused on that
and not let ourselves be distracted.
And stop behaving like an idiot.
And for goodness' sakes,
stop showing this thing to everybody.
- Where's Tsar?!
- Where is the Tsar?!
- Where's Tsar?!
- Where is the Tsar?!
- What happened?
- Where is Tsar?
Don't move, or I'll break your arm.
What did you do to my father?
How did you get the Seal?
Who are you?
- Cheng Lan?
- How do you know my name?
Hands up!
Thank you, darling.
I am not your darling.
So, I want to hear your story now.
We've arrived here from Moscow.
A wonderful man saved me
from certain death.
His name is Jonathan Green.
- Jonathan.
- Wait, wait, wait.
I suppose it was
the best journey of his life.
Full of wonderful discoveries.
Just two of them.
A lot must have happened, I would think.
Yes, there were different situations.
But I must say,
I always felt good and safe around him.
Where is he?
Miss Dudley, please.
I'm sorry, Princess.
This is his fianc√©e.
- His wife. Mother of his son.
- Oh.
- Anyway...
- I don't need any excuses.
You chaps know where the bathroom is?
I'm a servant of the Queen. Unhand me.
I'm a British...
Huh?
Do you still not understand
where you are?
I'm the law here,
and my power is boundless.
What powers?
I have seen your inventions.
Spears, arrows...
These are brass toys
from a bygone century.
You're a blind man,
just exactly like all the others.
I didn't resurrect
any ancient army.
I just put my soldiers
in invulnerable armor.
We've learned to control lightning...
And we can control the power of sound.
And very soon,
when I have the Seal of the Dragon,
I will rule the world.
And you are the perfect bait.
When she finds out
I've decided to execute you,
she'll deliver herself
right into my hands.
Take him away.
Move it.
Where the hell did you bring us?
I believe it's my turn to ask questions.
So... how did you get my father's seal?
I'm very grateful to your father.
Both of us were imprisoned
in the Tower of London.
All those long British evenings
he kept teaching me
the secrets of his amazing art.
And I learned a lot from him.
Should I believe you?
You don't believe me.
Well, watch.
What are you laughing at?
I broke the chains and I stopped
a storm like this.
Give them back their weapons.
Thank you.
Now you actually do believe me.
I can say that you are the true Princess.
Take it. This is yours.
I'm very grateful to you.
- Chinese monster?
- The map.
You may not believe this,
but these creatures are from Russia.
This is Jonathan's handwriting.
Do you know what it is?
Do you understand?
I know how to read it.
We need a...
- Mirror.
- Mirror.
Oh, my rising sun,
the moon has come down from heaven.
I have good news.
I have brought them... here.
Princess, please forgive us.
We were unable to find your father.
I swear to serve and protect you
for the rest of my life.
Is this really all you have to tell me
about your long trip?
We have found the Dragon's Seal.
You've found it?
- So, give it to me!
- A nobleman has it.
The Russian tsar, Peter the Great.
Zhong Zhe, stay here.
And you, bring me the Russian tsar.
Princess! But how are you...?
Who... Who's in the palace?
She's an evil witch.
She uses a mask with the Princess' face
and rules in her stead.
Our brother just swore to give his life
in service of that witch.
She tricked all of us.
Princess, he's only in love with you.
He never would have been faithful
to her if he knew.
The Witch and her servants believe
that the palace is inaccessible.
He made a very accurate map.
We can get in
through the cave under the water.
My Cossacks can do a lot of things.
They will release Jonathan Green,
and you will get to your Dragon.
My people can also attack
the palace by air.
What do you mean, by air?
Jonathan Green
is not only a great cartographer,
he's a great scientist.
He has calculated everything precisely,
according to the flight of a bird.
Please, go gather all
the umbrellas in the village.
- Yes, tell them.
- Okay.
I will get to the Dragon,
show him the Seal
and hope he recognizes
that I am the true Princess.
We also need to come up
with new weapons
to break through their defenses.
I suggest we use pepper.
We will answer their spears and arrows
with pepper from our crossbows.
It remains to be seen
how we will deal with the Magicians.
She thinks that I have the Seal,
so it will give us some more time.
I'll go and prepare myself, too.
I need to change my dress.
I can't fight in this.
Hm.
The battle's commencing.
Help me with my corset.
I'm not your servant, lady, but all right.
Take me with you. You won't regret it.
I'll think about it.
Whoa, you wanna kill me?
You bastard. I'll kill you.
Good luck.
What about me?
Hey, stop. What do you need
that many umbrellas for?
It's gonna be hot today.
Will it be that sunny?
Your Highness, what brings you
to my domain?
Dear Princess,
I have a very important mission to pursue.
Perhaps we should talk privately, then.
- Come with me.
- That was fast.
There are legends about me in Russia.
Don't let her break your heart,
Your Majesty.
Stay there. I'll be right back.
Come with me.
Mm, what beautiful chambers.
What in God's name is happening?
And now, let's have another
fair and just execution.
Let the Dragon decide the fate
of the foreign traveler.
- That's my husband!
- Is he your husband?
Please, have mercy!
Uh... if this is your husband,
then it's a completely different story.
Now I see things differently.
Well, then arrest her too.
- Take their weapons away!
- Let me go!
They are lying to you!
She is not the real Princess!
Tie her up with the other foreigner.
The white-skinned woman is a witch!
Hm.
Mmm. Mmm, delicious.
No! Let me go!
Who's there?
Go right.
Now, open the mouth at him.
Pull back the rock.
That's-that's not the real dragon.
Let's take it all down.
Hurry up! Rip the other line!
Who... Who is that?
Who is it? I can hear you,
but I-I don't understand you.
Speak clearly.
Open the mouth wider!
Huh?
Wait! What do you want?
How many are there?
We were waiting for Cheng Lan.
Now we have to fry you up
as an appetizer.
This one is done.
Search him and bring the Seal to me.
I'll prepare to meet with the Dragon now.
Pump the bellows!
Get the blower ready!
That's it.
Hurry it up!
Prepare the lightning charge!
More!
Open the mouth wider!
- Shh.
- Where did you come from?
Everybody swam, so I swam too.
Hey. All right.
Cut this one, too.
And here comes the surprise.
What's happening?
Hello, beautiful. Still regret me?
Now you're free.
Emma‚Äù?
Run.
Oh, sorry.
It's you. It's really you.
My father was right.
Why didn't I listen?
What did you do that for?
Now do you understand?
You are upset. I can... I can see that.
Of course I'm upset!
You traveled in the same carriage...
- What?
- ...with that... girl.
- What girl are you talking about?
- The most beautiful girl in China.
I love... you.
- Get away.
- Not now.
Faster!
Shields! Spears!
Archers ready!
Shoot!
Get ready... shoot!
Come here.
Give me your hand.
Oil
Dragon.
I command you to obey.
I am here to save you now.
And now...
Your Majesty.
What? Where is the Seal?
Your Majesty, this is everything we found.
I've got to do everything myself.
Let's go!
Get the sheet ready!
Oh...
Bring us two more!
There's nothing left!
They destroyed the laboratory.
Where is the Seal?
For your information,
people have been trying to poison me
right from my birth,
so now there is no poison
that affects me.
Get us up if you don't
want me to kill her.
Come on!
Here!
Oh, my incomparable Princess,
we are finished.
The forces are running out, and the rebels
will soon take over the palace!
- Let her go.
- And they have defeated the Magicians!
What should we do, my Princess?
What should we do?
I've already actually shaved today.
I have a plan. As I already said,
we should run.
You're right. Go gather up all the gold.
Kill him now.
Zhong Zhe, no.
She is not Cheng Lan. She's the Witch!
What are you waiting for? I said kill him!
Zhong Zhe, trust us.
We are your brothers.
Gold, gold. My precious gold.
Stand by your oath.
What are you waiting for? Kill him now!
Don't listen to her! You swore your oath
to Cheng Lan, not this witch!
Is it true?
Don't listen to them. I'm Cheng Lan.
Zhong Zhe!
Finally, you'll be mine, Your Majesty.
You're too heavy.
The boat can't carry the two of us.
Definitely, a witch.
So long, fools! Ha!
Ah...
Mistress! Mistress!
My Princess, my sun.
Our mistress needs help!
I'll take your mask off.
And I will take the Dragon Seal
away from you!
You are not worthy of the Seal!
It only goes to those
chosen by the Dragon.
Look!
Let's go! This way! Quickly!
Stop it.
Spare yourself the humiliation.
Maybe people will forgive you.
How are you doing this?
Take the Seal away from her!
I don't need you anymore.
Your Majesty, why are you doing this?
Come!
Perfect timing. She's the impostor!
Take her away!
What did she say?
This is the true Princess.
I gave her the Seal myself.
Then, this is the fraud!
That's an impostor!
She's not the real Princess!
Silence her.
Here is Kho Tchai.
Wait, wait! Don't hurt her!
She is Cheng Lan.
He recognized her. He can't be wrong.
She's my friend!
She's the real Princess!
Please, don't die, Jonathan!
Not when I've just found youl!
Please, don't die.
You silly foreigners.
Now I control the power of the Seal.
And I am the Chosen!
Dragon, come to me!
I command you to fly to me!
I command you!
I have a...
Nasty creature!
Ah!
I command you to save me!
No!
Please, don't die, Jonathan.
Your son is waiting for you.
- My son?
- Yes!
You have a son.
Please... Please! Please, don't die. No!
Now you have to defend.
Fight with me, Daniel. Fight with me.
Fight with me, Daniel.
Oh, oh, a pigeon.
Dear father,
please forgive the smudged writing.
I've been crying so much
in the last few days.
I cry from happiness.
Finally, I've found him.
- You saved my life.
- That's true.
The one person who could
really help us right now is the Master,
the one who is jailed in the Tower.
I ask you to employ all of your influence
to arrange for his release,
so that he can return to China
as soon as possible.
By the will of Your Majesty,
you are now free.
It's unfortunate to lose you already,
because I've just started
to learn about your art.
You are the strongest opponent
I've ever had.
Free him.
Oh, by the way.
Lord Dudley mentioned something
about "A dragon is free"?
Come with me to China.
I will show you everything.
Did you really swear
you were going to protect her
for the entire rest of your life?
Yes, but I thought she was you.
It's a pity I didn't hear it.
If you swore it, protect me.
You see, it wasn't the Seal
that gave power over the Dragon.
It was love.
He sees our hearts.
He knows who is good,
and he helps people with pure intentions.
That's why he gave us the Healing Tea.
So, that's it for today. Go study.
Get ready!
Start!
One. Two.
I'm so happy you've finally
got out of your prison.
Well, where is the dragon?
I left the Tower to come all the way
over here to see the dragon.
He's here, he's everywhere.
He's always among us.
But where?
Look.
He's everywhere.
He is in the mountains...
the sea...
and the sky above us.
