"The Girl By The Lake"
Make sure you go straight home.
You're going to school tomorrow.
Promise.
I promise, auntie.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Good morning, Maria.
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Marta.
- Hi, Silvia.
Anna.
It's late.
I was dreaming.
You shouldn't have woken me up.
Hi, Mario.
I can't.
Mom'll get worried.
All right.
Bye, Alfredo.
"My darling, I've been longing
to write to you for ages..."
- Lorenzo!
- Paola, what is it?
- Marta's gone missing!
- What?
We've been looking for her
for the past hour!
What'll I do?
Calm down.
Tell me what happened.
I've looked everywhere for her!
When I'm on night shift,
she sleeps at Lucia's,
and if she skips school,
she comes home by herself.
But this morning...
- Maybe she's with a friend.
- No!
She only stops to feed
Mr. Armando's dog.
I'll help you.
They're looking for her
out of town too.
Out of town?
Why?
Why would she go out of town?
His name's Hercules.
He's sick.
But he's my favorite.
He's the oldest of them all.
You can stroke him,
if you like.
My father would like to fry him,
but I won't let him.
I've made a grave for him
nearby for when he dies.
I'd rather fry my father.
Can I use your toilet?
It's over there.
Yes?
Yes, it's me.
Since when?
I'll be down in ten minutes.
The little girl?
Mario,
I asked you where the girl is!
She's gone.
Are you happy now?
Where did you leave your jacket?
I lost it.
Inspector, I'm sorry to bother you for
something so silly.
Is that her?
Yes, she was on her way
into town.
- Did she say where she'd been?
- To see Mario's rabbits.
- Who's this Mario?
- A weirdo, but he's harmless.
Everyone's harmless
till they turn nasty.
And who are you?
I'm Giovanni.
Your mom called me.
She was worried.
- Is she mad?
- I don't think so.
We'd better go.
She's waiting.
Mario's worried that his dad
will take Hercules
and fry him.
- Who's Hercules?
- A rabbit.
I wanted to take him with us,
but Mario said
that he'd be frightened
at the Lake of the Serpent.
It's a small lake near here.
There's a legend.
A snake lives in the water,
and if you look at it,
you fall asleep forever.
Do you believe that?
It's not a legend!
Today the snake came
and cast a spell.
Nonsense, sweetheart...
Will you tell me what happened
at the lake with Mario?
Marta!
Maybe we should
leave them alone awhile.
Inspector.
Holy God.
- You know who she is?
- It's Anna.
Anna Nadàl.
Can you be quiet, please?
Siboldi, who are you calling?
Sorry, I've finished.
- Seen anyone from the station?
- Yes, Prosecutor Giani is here.
I don't see her anymore.
- You want the jacket kept on?
- Leave her as she is.
When you've taken enough photos,
remove the jacket.
- How did she die?
- Respiratory failure.
She could've drowned,
but there may be another cause.
- Seen the marks on her neck?
- Yes.
Body temperature: 30 °C.
She's been dead a few hours.
- I have to take her away now.
- Wait.
Let me look at her
for a bit longer.
Siboldi, clear the area.
Move away, please!
Take the jacket off.
Where does this Mario live?
Down there, over the hill,
but we'd better take the car.
All right, let's go.
Inspector, Mario's a screwball,
but he wouldn't hurt a fly.
You've told me.
I know he's your friend.
He's everyone's friend.
Okay,
but I want a word with him.
- Can I?
- Of course.
Good.
Alfredo, go into town,
get some info on the girl.
Where she lived, with whom,
who saw her last...
Here's the law.
Wait a minute.
Everything okay?
You need to have guts
to do this job.
I don't,
not at the moment.
I'm going.
Alfredo will help you.
Alfredo, your trusted assistant.
I'll go talk to him.
He's heading into town.
If you hurry, you'll catch him.
Okay.
You see that man?
If you keep lying,
he'll lock you up.
- Not locked up!
- He will!
- Go easy, Siboldi.
- I don't want to be locked up.
No, Mario.
Don't worry.
But we need your help.
Tell me why you're so scared.
What are you scared of?
Is it something you saw
at the lake?
Are you scared of me?
Of your father?
Please, leave me alone
with Mario.
- Why?
- Just for a few minutes.
- But why?
- I don't need to explain.
Don't you?
Won't you explain?
You just waltz in here...
like it's your house!
No need to shout.
I'm not deaf.
Who are you,
an inspector?
I'm just doing my job.
Keep this dog away.
If he attacks me,
I'll shoot him!
Be good.
Please, go into the other room.
Come on, Siboldi!
Come with me.
- Need a hand?
- No, I don't need any help.
So, Mario,
that girl you saw at the lake,
was she lying like that,
or did you move her?
She was like that.
You didn't touch her?
Where did you touch her?
- Here.
- Why?
To talk to her.
I asked her if she was sleeping, but she
didn't reply,
so I whispered in her ear, quietly.
What did you say?
That she shouldn't have swum
in the lake
because
this is the season of the snake.
The snake
looked her in the eyes,
cast its spell,
and put her to sleep.
How do you know
the snake looked at her?
Because she was under a spell.
Why did you put your jacket
over her?
I thought she was cold.
My jacket's very warm.
Mario, that girl's dead.
That's a bit soon.
I agree.
Did you know her well?
Yes, she used to pass by here
when she went running.
I was there when she won
the hockey medal.
- Were you fond of her?
- Yes, quite a bit.
How much?
I always wanted her to win.
Apart from you,
who else was fond of her?
- Her father.
- Of course, her dad.
- And apart from her dad?
- Everyone.
- No one disliked her?
- No.
You're sure?
If I tell you,
what'll you do?
Nothing.
It'll be our secret.
My father hates her
because Anna
has long, slim legs.
Instead he...
Anna had an older boyfriend,
Roberto Biasutti.
He works in a factory near here.
The girl's father
is Davide Nadàl.
He's a widower.
He went to visit
his brother in Tarvisio today.
He has another daughter,
Silvia, a student.
She's trying to get hold of him.
Yes, thanks.
The Mayor is letting us use
some spare rooms.
Roberto lives with his mom.
She's a housekeeper.
- And his father?
- There's never been a father.
Never been a father...
There's always a father.
Anna was the only decent thing.
The only one.
If you don't feel like talking,
we can come back.
No, I'm all right.
You want some water?
Something stronger?
I don't want anything.
Your mom told me
you stayed home all day today.
- I didn't go to work.
- Why?
It's no fun working
in the factory.
I call in sick
every now and then.
When did you last see Anna?
This morning.
This morning?
At what time?
I left her house
just before 8:00.
Were you having sex?
- Why do you ask?
- I need to know.
That's private.
Isn't there a law on privacy?
Yes, but there's been a murder.
Well?
Of course
we were having sex.
I won't be back tonight.
Can you stay at Agnese's?
I'd rather you stayed
with Agnese.
All right, bye.
We've talked
to her neighbors.
She went out at about 8:00,
as usual.
There's a man outside
who met her in town.
- Who is he?
- Corrado Canali, a local.
He has a shop in Udine.
But his wife runs it now.
They split up...
- Fine, show him in.
- Yes.
- May I?
- Come in.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I just heard about Anna.
It's awful.
I knew her well.
She was Angelo's babysitter,
my son.
- Where did you see her today?
- Outside the coffee shop.
She was going in,
and I offered her a coffee.
- Did she accept?
- No, she had to go.
- Did she say where?
- No.
That's all for now,
but as I've told everyone,
don't leave town.
We may need
to speak to you again.
All right.
- Good-bye.
- Bye.
Is there anything
that didn't belong to her?
No, it's all hers.
I don't want to identify her.
I can't do it.
Don't worry, Mr. Nadàl.
Your daughter Silvia did it.
- She's not my daughter.
- Sorry?
When I met my wife,
she'd just lost her husband.
Silvia was
just over a year old.
- Her phone's missing.
- Forensics has it.
Where's her backpack?
You're sure
she had it with her?
She had it when she left.
How can someone die like this?
How can this happen?
I want to be able to cry alone.
- Not in front of you.
- We won't be long.
What was in Anna's backpack?
It's gone.
The usual, I think,
nothing special.
Did she keep a diary?
I don't know.
She wouldn't have told me anyway.
Why not?
Anna was different.
She was totally different
from me.
You're beautiful, and Anna?
Didn't you see her?
I did.
Didn't you see
how beautiful she was?
Can I go now?
I want to take my dad home.
Would you help us try to find
some clues in Anna's room?
- Now?
- Yes.
- All right.
- Come, Silvia.
Can I give something to her dad?
He keeps crying.
He keeps saying,
"My little girl!"
What can you give him?
Some medicine?
What medicine, what medicine...
"My little girl"...
- Whose watch is that?
- Roberto's.
They used to swap them occasionally.
They stayed here last night.
Did you see them?
No, maybe when
they came upstairs.
I was sleeping.
They met secretly
because my dad hates Roberto.
He says he's a loafer.
- What's Roberto like?
- Like that.
If everyone hated loafers,
we'd have to hate
half the world.
You want some spaghetti?
Whatever's easiest.
You've got a burn?
No, it's atypical dermatitis.
What does that mean?
That they don't know the cure.
Come on,
film something else!
Come on, Dad.
Stop it.
It's a difficult age.
I'm used to it.
Eight months ago,
she told me she didn't want
to compete anymore,
that she only enjoyed
running on the hill,
by herself.
"It's not fun by yourself,"
I said jokingly.
- Jokingly?
- Yes, to make her laugh.
- Did she laugh?
- No, she never laughed!
What did you do?
Laugh by yourself?
Maybe you don't understand.
- Did you try it on with Anna?
- Why do you ask?
Did you or didn't you?
If I say yes,
will I be a suspect?
You already are.
You've got a record.
You've been sentenced.
Unjustly.
Read the verdict again.
I will.
Now just answer my questions.
Anna was a beautiful girl.
At that time,
she wasn't with Roberto.
I thought
we could get it together.
At that time, she was 17.
She was a minor.
Yes, but I didn't want...
You're twice her age,
"get it together" how?
We didn't do anything.
We were just friends.
Even after she'd left,
she'd come by for a chat.
Ask the others what Anna
was like with me.
I enjoy flirting with girls.
She knew that.
I even took her to Udine
about a month ago.
- What for?
- To pick up some test results.
- She'd missed the bus.
- What were the tests for?
I asked her, but she said
it wasn't any of my business.
I thought Roberto
had gotten her pregnant.
But that's how she was.
That's why
I chose her as captain.
- When did you last see her?
- Yesterday morning.
- Where and at what time?
- Near the coffee shop.
I drove past her.
She was with Corrado Canali.
Be more precise.
Did she stop him?
Did they meet by chance?
I don't know.
They were talking.
If we had more officers,
I'd have him followed.
- Why?
- Just because.
I went to...
Did you find any medical test results in
her room?
- I don't think so...
- Yes or no?
No.
Here are the printouts
we requested.
These are people
who Anna called frequently.
It'll take a few days
for the rest.
They're Persian.
They're from Baluchistan,
southern Iran.
Is it true kids make these?
In some areas, yes.
Because
they have small fingers?
Yes, they're better
at knotting.
Actually, it's the little girls
who have smaller fingers...
It doesn't matter.
Those are not made by kids, though.
Why didn't you tell me
Anna called you every day,
at any time, day or night?
I wanted to.
Why didn't you?
You'd have got the wrong idea.
Did you have a relationship?
Did you arrange to meet yesterday?
No.
I told you.
I just bumped into her.
She had a sort of crush.
She thought
she was in love with me.
She knew I was sad
after I left my wife,
so she'd call me.
You can't have any secrets
in a town like this.
Everyone knows your business.
Ask around.
You'll see it's true.
Alfredo and I
are going back to the city.
I need to sleep.
I'm exhausted.
Good night, sir.
Bye.
Getting a D in History is worse than
getting an F in Latin.
What's that on your arm?
Atypical dermatitis.
I've had it for a month.
24 absences in a term
are a bit much.
I don't feel like
studying lately,
so I skip school.
Everyone does.
You have to copy
everyone else?
Yes.
- Where do you go instead?
- Around.
- Around?
- I'll be late.
Francesca,
who do you go around with?
I go by myself.
Finished with the third degree?
- Make sure you go today.
- Bye, Dad.
Prosecutor Giani asked me
lots of questions.
She doesn't understand
how we ended up here
after 20 years in homicide.
What did you say?
"For me and the Inspector,
all places are the same."
That's a good answer.
What did you think
when you saw her that day?
She looked
like she was sleeping.
Why go to all that trouble
to put her in that position?
Put the criminal part
of your mind to work.
It's too hard.
I don't know.
I thought...
that they'd undressed her
to make it look
like a sexual crime.
Perhaps.
But then they couldn't just leave her lying
in the mud,
so they placed her on her side,
as if she was asleep.
They wanted it to look peaceful.
Then they glanced back
and saw Anna's eyes
watching them.
They thought that image
would torment them forever,
so they went back
and turned her head.
There are sentiments involved.
Whoever put her in that position
was fond of her.
They're beautiful.
Carlo will love them.
You're so kind.
It wasn't my idea.
They're from Francesca.
Francesca?
You see, right now,
I'm a bit confused.
Is she someone
I should know?
Is it important?
No, not at all.
Carlo had to go home.
It was awful.
The doctors said
he'll be back soon.
They promised.
- You miss him?
- A lot.
When he's here,
I don't feel alone in the world.
Of course, there's you too.
It's sweet of you
to come all this way.
Taking those early flights,
leaving your students,
your wife.
You're very kind.
It's just that Carlo
makes that feeling I have
go away,
that feeling of sadness.
He tells me
I'm beautiful.
I know it's not true,
but I could cry with joy
when he tells me.
That's enough about me.
Tell me your secrets.
What secrets?
I have none.
Some time ago, I noticed
you kept a gun in your drawer.
I don't remember
where we were.
At the beach house?
I don't know.
So I thought,
"Why does
an English literature professor
have a gun in his drawer?"
Isn't that a secret?
How's your wife?
Worse.
The doctors warned me
she'd get worse.
She thought I was her brother
from abroad.
She no longer remembers
she has a daughter.
How can I explain that
to Francesca?
Inspector,
I've got the search warrant
for Roberto's house.
I'm going.
I'll come
as soon as I'm done here.
See you later.
The girl knew the murderer.
She trusted him.
Was she raped?
No, she was a virgin.
- You're sure?
- She'd never had sex.
How was she killed?
He held her head underwater.
She has marks on her neck.
How long does it take to die
like that?
Anna was an athlete.
She had
an excellent lung capacity,
at least seven or eight minutes.
My God!
No traces of skin
under her nails.
She didn't try to scratch.
It didn't take
much effort to kill her.
Could it have been a woman?
It's possible.
Yet Anna was strong.
Yes, but she didn't fight back.
She let herself die.
Maybe Anna was in agreement
with her killer.
That's not possible!
She was so full of life!
Anna was ill.
She had a brain tumor.
- Was it treatable?
- I don't think so.
She had at most a year to live.
When will I get
my daughter back?
Soon, very soon.
I need to know.
Why won't you tell me?
I need to organize her funeral.
Her relatives are waiting.
What shall I tell them?
Tell them in two days.
You swear?
Yes.
Listen, that doctor came
and sat down here just like you.
He asked me what medicines
Anna was taking.
- Why is he asking me that?
- Listen...
Statements have to be accurate.
Maybe she just had headaches.
Of course,
like everyone.
What's that got to do with it?
We're asking these questions
because there's something
we don't understand.
Why did Anna give up hockey?
She was a strong girl.
Maybe she wasn't well,
maybe there was something wrong.
No...
Anna left the team
after that little boy died.
What boy?
Angelo,
Chiara and Corrado Canali's son.
The one she babysat?
He was three years old.
After that,
Anna cried for a whole week.
And that's why
she stopped playing.
If there'd been something else,
she'd have told me.
You're sure Anna
told you everything?
I'm her father.
I knew her.
- Do you have kids?
- A daughter.
Don't you know
what goes through her mind?
You didn't go to work today either.
Mom, please!
Don't you start too!
You know what's happened, right?
Yes, but they'll pretend
they don't know.
If you don't go in tomorrow,
they'll fire you!
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
What are these?
Anna gave them to me.
She didn't want them
at her house.
You didn't ask me for them.
You think we're stupid?
If you'd said you wanted
medical tests,
I'd have given you them
and avoided this mess.
We'll tidy up.
I'm taking these too.
Those are Anna's.
Something else
you didn't tell us about.
You can explain it
to the Inspector.
I'm shaking all over.
Inspector, can you come?
It's just for a minute.
It's there.
We haven't touched it.
Seen this before?
- It's Anna's.
- I know.
- Where was it?
- Outside.
No, that's not true.
- You have to come with us.
- Why?
Because I said so.
What do you want from me?
You want to frame me?
It wasn't me.
- What did you do, Roberto?
- Mom, please!
Roberto!
And now what?
He had Anna's medical tests
and her backpack.
I wanted to arrest him,
but the shit ran away.
He knocked Binacci down.
He's a new recruit.
But you're not!
Did you want me to shoot him?
He went down there.
- What's down there?
- The river.
I've called the patrol cars.
He won't get away.
- Where the fuck are you going?
- Go easy, Siboldi.
I didn't do it!
It wasn't me!
I'm not the one you're after.
You have to believe me!
I loved Anna!
I didn't do it!
- So why run away?
- Take him away.
- I nearly had a heart attack.
- That's enough!
Come,
before it gets cold.
I'm coming.
- What's this?
- Reheated soup.
You should've said
you'd be back.
- Her name was Anna, right?
- Yes.
Was she beautiful?
We've arrested her boyfriend.
- Was it him?
- Maybe.
- Why would he have done it?
- I don't know yet.
What if it wasn't him?
Not only has she gone,
but he's banged up,
worrying you'll get it wrong
and give him a life sentence.
Don't you ever worry
about being wrong?
All the time.
The soup's fine.
I'm just not hungry.
Francesca...
Why did you give up piano?
Again?
- Your fingers are so long...
- I told you.
- But you never explained why.
- Because I don't know.
- There must be a reason!
- But I don't know it.
I got bored.
I don't get it,
all of a sudden...
Dad, I said I don't know!
Leave it.
- I'll do it.
- Forget it.
Go and eat.
I'll do it.
I've almost finished.
Why do women
always turn their backs
when they argue?
Someone has to explain it to me!
- Did you see her today?
- Yes.
How is she?
Better.
- When can I see her?
- Not yet.
She'll get upset
if she sees you.
You'll see her here.
- Here?
- Yes.
Will you bring her home
even if she's not better?
No, I'll bring her back
because she will be better.
You just need to be patient.
Mom will be back,
and we'll all be happier.
You wonder
why I'm angry at you.
You never tell me the truth.
You treat me
like a five-year-old.
There is no cure
for Mom's illness.
What do you know?
I know.
I looked on the internet.
It's progressive.
There's no getting better.
You become a...
Stop.
That's enough.
That's enough.
Why did we come here?
Why don't you get a woman?
Just tell me why!
This is the Criminal Code,
Article 575, read it!
It says "homicide."
It's got nothing
to do with me.
I didn't do anything.
Why did you have Anna's CDs?
- I told you.
- Tell me again.
Her computer wasn't working,
so she used mine.
Why did you spend all day
looking at them?
- To see what was on them.
- Why?
To find some clues,
to find out who killed her!
- That's our job.
- Then we're in good hands!
I don't think you understand.
Your situation's serious.
So stop fooling us around.
Stop acting like an ass
and stop being a dickhead.
- I'm telling you the truth.
- Don't take me for a fool!
If you carry on saying
that you didn't know
about her backpack
or what those tests
were about
or that you only found out
after she'd died,
you'll get 30 years!
I told you the truth.
You just don't believe me.
You tell me
what the truth is then!
I'll tell you, all right.
Well?
What?
- Tell me the truth then.
- I've changed my mind.
Son of a...
Don't insult me!
Or you'll be sorry.
Let's keep calm.
Let's talk about the CDs.
You wanted to erase them.
It's not true.
It's not true...
Could tea be the cause
of this rash?
I've thought of everything
but not tea.
You found the password
for the CDs?
Not yet.
Was it her boyfriend?
It's very likely.
How did
Corrado Canali's son die?
An accident,
it was terrible.
He choked on a biscuit
during breakfast.
When they realized,
it was too late.
Have you noticed
that nowadays
pregnant women don't show?
Isn't that better?
No.
It's not better.
He says he was home
all day yesterday,
but he can't prove it.
He got a call at about 11:00,
but he didn't answer.
He says he had headphones on
and didn't hear it.
What do you think?
Well, I don't know.
We don't get on.
He doesn't like me.
- I have to get a statement.
- He's all yours.
I saw the video of Anna.
Those shots were pretty sick.
The way the father filmed her,
following her around.
They're all of Anna,
just Anna.
You can hear her sister's there,
but you never see her.
The father ignores her.
Did you get that impression too?
Yes.
- Let's talk to Nadàl again.
- Then what?
We accuse him of loving
his own daughter too much?
They say you're married
and have a daughter.
Is your wife pretty?
How did such a grouchy man
find himself a pretty wife?
Maybe I wasn't so grouchy.
Nice, aren't they?
They look perfect,
yet each one has a flaw,
an imperfect knot.
Is that intentional?
A Persian poet says,
it's so the goddess of the weave
can free herself.
You didn't come here to talk
about rugs, did you, Inspector?
You know me.
Don't be offended,
but I could tell right away.
No offense taken.
She wasn't like other girls
her age.
She was kinder,
more sensible.
She was strong and brave.
Why didn't anyone want
to look after your son?
The other girls preferred
looking after normal children.
Wasn't Angelo normal?
I thought you wanted
to know about Anna.
I'm just trying
to get the whole picture.
I thought you'd ask me
more routine questions.
- Like if I have an alibi.
- Do you?
No.
You're not the only one.
Angelo was ill.
He was in a world of his own,
constantly battling
with his fears.
The only thing the doctors said
was that he wouldn't
improve with age.
He could never sit still.
He never slept.
He cried all the time,
since he was born.
He'd cry inconsolably.
Angelo was a difficult child.
Only Anna
knew how to handle him.
She was patient.
He'd calm down with her.
He adored her.
I even felt jealous sometimes.
Jealous in what way?
Like all mothers who can't deal
with their kids' problems
and take it out on those
who are better at it.
I'll walk you back,
if you like.
Is that your boyfriend?
His name's Simone.
Why is he in Canali's shop?
He's a restorer.
He's picking up a check.
- Are you happy with him?
- Some days, I am.
What's happened to you?
The other day,
you were distraught.
Now you look much better.
How come?
I just stay away from pain.
That's easy to say.
I left home.
I'm staying with him.
You left your dad alone?
He's alone anyway,
alone with Anna.
And he's not my real dad.
My real dad died.
And those who knew him
say I'm not missing anything.
You can't choose your father.
You just make do
with what you have.
That's true.
I have to go.
Among the things
you confiscated,
there's a small bronze angel.
- I'd like it back.
- An angel?
Anna was very fond of it.
All right, I'll get it back
as soon as I can.
This is the way Anna
might have taken that morning.
What way
did she go to school?
The bus stop's here.
Her house is there.
So she went this way.
- Why did you lie?
- Still this question?
How many times
have you asked me?
Hundreds and thousands?
Why did you lie?
I wasn't thinking.
I was embarrassed.
If I told you I slept with Anna
without having sex,
you'd think I was mad.
I'm not mad.
I have no sexual hang-ups.
What would my motive be?
Why would I kill her?
Anna and I
cared about each other.
Why would I kill her?
Listen to me.
You don't know this,
but I do.
Murder victims are usually found
in awkward positions.
Anna wasn't.
It's as if death freed her
from suffering.
That's why we thought of you.
What do you mean?
Anna told you that
she didn't have long to live.
Maybe you cried together,
and you asked her
to die together.
But she asked you to avoid
doctors and clinics,
to let her die in silence,
without bothering anyone,
and you did that.
That's not true.
I only found out
she was ill yesterday.
I told her everything.
And she told me nothing.
His provisional arrest
needs validating.
Did you hear that?
I'm talking to you.
You're under arrest.
Do you have anything to say?
Fuck off.
Good lad.
We've unblocked the CDs.
Print what's on them.
I want to read it all.
What was the password?
"Angelo."
Inspector,
you can't smoke here.
Arrest me.
"My angel"
"School's just started,
and I'm exhausted already!
"Sometimes I wish
they'd understand me,
"that with just a glance,
"they'd understand
my melancholy...
"I need to realize
we're growing up
"and each of us is trying
to find our own identity.
"I fell asleep in class today.
"It wasn't the first time.
"I get overcome by exhaustion...
"I think your eye color
depends on your life.
"If someone's happy,
their eyes are bright.
"I imagined Angelo,
all grown-up and unshaven.
"He'll be hot with the girls,
and I'll be very jealous.
"I wish certain days
didn't exist,
"that they'd never existed.
"Everyone should express themselves in
their own way.
"Sometimes the team commitments
are draining,
but taking part
means a lot to me."
"When I go running on the hill
and head down to the lake,
"I always feel
Mario is watching me.
"He has kind eyes, but his dad's
stern expression scares me.
"His wife left him...
"Sometimes,
I'm just like my dad.
"I struggle to accept
I'm growing up
and that
I'm changing so much."
"When I go running on the hill
and head down to the lake,
"I always feel
Mario is watching me.
I'm not scared, but his dad
gives me the creeps."
What are you doing?
I'm digging a grave
for Hercules.
Dad says
he died of old age,
but if he poisoned him,
I'll smash his head in.
I know...
I shouldn't say that
about my dad, but I...
Where is he?
Where he always is,
damn him!
- I want a lawyer.
- You'll need one in court.
Answer my questions.
- You can't treat me as if...
- I'm not.
You're intimidating me
because I'm in a wheelchair...
Answer my questions!
Or would you
rather do it in a cell?
What can you do unaided?
Can you walk?
Can you drive your truck?
I can,
but I don't.
Why are the commands
on the steering wheel then?
I used to drive it
ten years ago.
- Squeeze my arm.
- What?
- Squeeze it.
- Why?
Just do as I say!
Harder.
Harder.
Squeeze it harder.
All right, that'll do.
Are you seeing
if I'm strong enough
to break a rabbit's neck?
No, if you could drown a girl.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know.
So you wouldn't
see her running by?
So Mario wouldn't look at her?
You hate Mario,
don't you?
I hated him when he was a boy
but not now.
He keeps me company.
It's just the two of us up here,
a paralytic old man
and a weirdo.
Why did you hate him?
You wouldn't understand.
Your children are probably healthy and
intelligent.
- Try.
- I can't.
I can't explain.
You hate yourself.
You think it's your fault.
Everything becomes black.
You can only understand
if you've been through it!
If this is about Anna again,
I've nothing to add.
It's not about Anna.
It's about Angelo.
Why?
If you don't feel like it now, I'll come
back tomorrow.
What's Angelo got to do
with Anna's death?
I don't know.
Ask me what you want,
then go.
Did you split up
because he died?
We couldn't cope with the loss,
with the guilt.
It was worse for Corrado.
Angelo was with him that day.
After months of tears, pain, madness,
we went our separate ways.
How did Angelo die?
He was having biscuits and milk when he
choked.
Something was stuck
in his throat.
He suffocated.
He couldn't shout.
What do you remember
about that day?
Everything.
I was in bed.
I hadn't slept all night
because Angelo had been up.
He cried till
5:00 in the morning.
Then he fell asleep,
but two hours later,
he was up again.
I couldn't take it anymore.
I was exhausted.
So Corrado went to him.
You stayed in bed?
Yes.
Were you sleeping?
Sort of.
Did you hear anything?
Their voices
as they had breakfast.
Nothing out of the ordinary?
Just Angelo screaming.
Angelo was screaming?
He always screamed.
He'd bash his cup on the table
for hours
until he got what he wanted.
You'd dress him,
and he'd instantly
undress himself.
You'd give him medicine.
He'd spit it out.
What about your husband?
Did he scream too?
What do you want from me?
Yes,
they both screamed.
But it was normal.
He was always like that.
My husband
went into the bathroom,
and Angelo kept on screaming.
So what did you do?
I put my head under the cushion.
You'd have done the same.
Anyone would have.
Then I fell asleep.
Could you still hear
from under the cushion?
What was your husband
screaming?
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea.
Tell me what he was screaming.
I won't get the wrong idea.
Never.
I'll never tell a living soul.
When I saw you out here
the other night,
I thought you were coming here.
Did you think so?
I think you hoped so.
Yes.
I hoped so.
Everyone hopes so.
It gets to a point where they can't hold it
in any longer.
And they need to talk, right?
I knew the other night.
But I needed more information.
I couldn't answer
the simplest question.
"Why?"
Anna and I
were seeing each other.
It had been going on
a few months.
Then she started making
ridiculous requests.
She wanted to live here.
She wanted me to tell Chiara.
She had become obsessive.
So you killed her.
Yes.
Yes.
My throat's a bit dry.
Want me to take you inside?
No, let's wait.
In different circumstances,
I'd have been offended
about such a big lie.
Don't you believe me?
No, I don't.
What else
do you want to know?
I told you.
She tormented me.
That morning, when I met her
at the coffee shop,
she insisted
that we had to talk.
We arranged
to meet at the lake,
but she wouldn't
listen to reason.
She was freaking out,
and I lost my temper.
And you threw her backpack
behind Roberto's house.
Yes.
You weren't having an affair with her.
She was a virgin.
She wouldn't have made
any plans.
She had no future.
She had a few months
left to live.
That's why
she didn't put up a fight.
Why are there no photos
of Angelo?
Why do you ask?
Why don't you just arrest me?
Answer me.
What do you know
how it feels to lose a child?
What do you know?
I can't imagine it.
You go to the bathroom,
and you find his toothbrush
or his rubber duck
on the bathtub.
Months go by.
Then you find more toys
under the sofa.
So you put everything away.
But every time, you feel like
you're committing a crime.
You know how long
a child's smell
lingers on their pajamas?
Who called the ambulance
the day Angelo died?
The operator says
it was a girl's voice,
in such a state
that she didn't leave her name.
A girl who came past here
every day,
right past your window.
Anna told him what she'd seen,
that Angelo
had stopped breathing
and no one
was trying to help him, no one.
And she also saw you.
You heard Angelo coughing, but...
You did nothing.
That's enough.
That's enough.
From the day Anna found out
she was ill,
she'd become obsessive.
Her glances, her calls...
accused you
and wouldn't let you forget.
I've just confessed a murder.
I killed Anna.
That's enough.
All right.
My husband said he doesn't want
to be there during the birth.
I was disappointed.
Were you at
your daughter's birth?
I opted out too.
See what you men are like?
And your wife?
She was disappointed too.
Now, after all this time,
do you regret it?
Yes.
If I invite you to dinner,
will you tell my husband?
What?
That you regret it now.
Of course.
Are you being serious?
Of course.
I came to say
we made a mistake.
Your mom's outside
waiting for you.
We never know what to say
to people we've wrongly accused.
I'm sorry.
You've been very strong.
Maybe you should have
a good cry now.
But not on your shoulder.
Right.
Does she really love him?
That's what the doctors say.
What about him?
He adores her.
Did you see that?
She smiled at you.
