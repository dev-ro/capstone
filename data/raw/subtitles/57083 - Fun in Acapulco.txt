Shh, shh.
Everyone's asleep. Siesta.

Hey, amigo, what's your name?

See you later, Mike.
The natives are restless
this morning.
So are you.
l'm always restless.
Why don't you go back to bed?
l'd rather be with you.
Come back when you've grown up.
You mean l'm going to get
any more grown up than this?
How old do you think
l am, anyway?
l don't know, but l'm
sure l've got neckties
that are older than you are.
Nobody understands
that women mature younger
these days--
just nature at work.
Well, nature
doesn't do my work.
So, why don't you
be a nice girl
and just, uh, run along now.
lt's my dad's boat, you know.
l could get you fired.
Why don't you?
Go back to your dolls.
Why?
So you can go back to yours?
Ha!
Ha.
Torito's al izquierda.
Gracias.
¿ Cuanto es?
Tres pesos.
Keep the change.
Thank you very much.
Señor, you wish
to go dancing?
Sorry, l'm going
to El Torito's.
That's the place.
Tell them l sent you.
Would you like to buy
beautiful jewelry?
No, thanks.
Beautiful ring? Bracelet?
For your girlfriend?
l don't want it.
l got nobody to buy it for.
l'm sorry.
Viva el dinero
Viva, viva...
Dance, one peso?
No, thank you, not right now.
Viva el vino
Viva el dinero
Viva, viva, el amor.
Hey, amigo, you remember us!
Sure, l remember you, Sam.
-No, he's Sam.
-l'm Sam.
-Oh, hi, Sam.
-Bienvenido.
He's the skipper of a boat.
No, l'm not the skipper.
Cinco tequilas.
No, quatro tequila and one beer.
Si, señor.
We're going to sing a song

Viva el vino!

You're rich as you can be
So, lift up your glass
Let's sing it all together

And now,

Salud.
Salud!
Señorita.
Uh, you dance for un peso?
No, l don't. Do you?
l'm estupido.
Please forgive me.
l don't speak Spanish,
and l'm a little confused.
Will you have something?
Why do you drink cerveza?
A man like you
should drink tequila.
ls that what separates
the men from the boys?
Wait here-- l'll be back
in un momentito
and then, you will
join us for a drink.
Why not?
Hey, you're a lucky fellow.
She's a beautiful girl.
That's Dolores Gomez.
You know her?
Everybody knows her.
Si.
Oh, then l might as well,
uh, join the club.
We're going to sing
a song for you.

Señor
you will join us?
That's right.
Salud.
Bien hecho.
Delicious.
l am Jose Garcia.
Mike Windgren.
Uh, Rico...
Julio, Juan, Pepe...
Mucho gusto.
...and of course
you have already met Dolores.
Tell me, why is everyone
toasting you?
You mean, you weren't
at the bullfights
this afternoon?
No.
You didn't see her kill
the biggest bull?
No, but l know when
l'm getting it.
You don't like
lady bullfighters?
Well, l thought all
bullfighters were men.
Well, if Dolores looks
like a man to you
you need glasses, amigo,
thick ones.
Shall l throw him out?
No, not yet.
Now, these men are good matadors
and courageous
but courage
is expected of men...
but a beautiful girl
like Dolores fights the bull--
ay, fantastico!
Enough, Jose.
The offer of a peso a dance
is still good?
Sure.
No, thanks, l wouldn't want
to lose my amateur standing.
So we dance anyway.
Who leads?
We'll take turns.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Jose talks a lot.
Too much.
Your husband?
No, he works for me.
That's all?
You've got, uh...
how do you say?
The big nose.
Uh-oh... trouble.
Would you excuse me
for a moment, please?
Your wife?
You've got, uh, how you say it?
The big nose.
Not hardly.
Be right back.
What are you doing here?
This is not a malt
or a hamburger joint.
You're here.
lt has to be respectable.
And that better be
co-cola you're drinking
or your dad'll go
right through the roof.
Uh-oh...
back to the convent.
What are you doing here?
How did you find
a place like this?
You're manufacturing
cholesterol
by the quart, Daddy.
Answer my question!
He brought us.
Now, wait a minute, monster.
And he ordered the drinks, too.
lt is Coke, isn't it, Daddy?
You ought to be ashamed
bringing my daughter here,
ordering liquor.
But l didn't bring her here.
She engineered this
all by herself.
Of course we did.
Now, how could we ever
find a place like this
without his help?
That's what l thought.
You're fired! And you're lucky
l don't have you arrested
for contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.
She was a delinquent long before
anyone contributed anything.
Señor!
Hey, Señor, what you
going to do now?
Hey, why are you mad at me?
Why don't you be a good boy
and just run along home, huh?
Want a shoe shine?
No, l don't want a shoe shine
or bracelets or pictures
or anything.
Just go home.
No madre.
Well, then go to your padre.
No padre.
Nobody.
l'm sorry, kid.
ls all right.
You sing pretty good
for a gringo.
With my help,
you're going to be okay.
l be your manager.
Look, kid, l don't
need a manager.
l get in enough trouble
without your help, believe me.
Then l be your amigo--
for free.
Well, an amigo l
could use right now.
My name is Raoul.
Ra-oul.
Mike Windgren.
Okay, now what we going to do?
Well, amigo... l don't have
the money to get back home.
So, uh, we better find us a job.
No good.
Why not?
To work in Mexico,
you have to be an imigrante.
What is an imigrante?
When you have a permit to work,
but that takes long time.
And how am l supposed to
eat while l'm waiting?
l have another amigo
who might help us mañana.
Well, let's worry
about it mañana.
Okay, amigo, l see you
in the morning, 10:00
in front of the church,
in the plaza.
l go there to pray for you.
l can pray for myself.
We need all the help we can get.
Buenas noches.
You can't come in here.
You... my cousin...
would stop me?
For 50 centavos, your cousin
will turn around the other way.
Put it on my bill.
Buenos dias, Señor.
Shoeshine boys are not
permitted in the lobby.
l have business here.
What do you want?
To see the manager.
The manager?
You ask him. Go on.
l have to know
what it is about.
lt's about l want
to see the manager.
He is my amigo.
We'll see.
l'm sorry to bother you, Señor
but there is a boy
insisting on seeing you.
What is your name?
Raoul Almedo.
Raoul Almedo.
Yes, sir.
Right away, sir.
You can go right in.
What can l do for you, amigo?
You know, for a cousin,
you ask me many favors.
ls El Trovador giving you
trouble again, no?
Oh, El Trovador, the
plumbing, the guests...
One group complains the music
at the pool is too loud.
l turn it down.
Another group complains
the music is not loud enough.
So, turn it off.
That way,
everybody'd be unhappy.
l did.
How did you know
that El Trovador
was giving me trouble, eh?
You're not the only
cousin l have
that works here.
Every time he thinks he should
have a raise, he gets sick.
l should close the big room
because he's going to have
a small headache.
l have an amigo who is a better
singer than El Trovador
and he's very healthy.
Do l know him?
No, but you will.
l bring him to meet you.
l could not hire him.
El Trovador will get mad at me.
ls El Trovador running
this hotel?
Certainly not.
lf you say so, Señor.
Okay, Raoul.
l will meet him.
Hasta luego.
¿ Como esta, amigo?
Muy bien, gracias.
Come, we go now.
l thought you were
going inside to pray.
Today, l prayed outside.
Okay. Now, where are we going?
l think l have a job for you,
at the Acapulco Hilton.
Doing what?
They have a great big room
with beautiful drapes
and beautiful tables
with lots
of beautiful people
and beautiful music.
Only, the people come
and see and hear
a not beautiful singer.
He is El Trovador.
l've never heard such
a long, sad story.
When he sing, sometimes
El Trovador has headaches.
lt's better him
than the audience.
His headaches
is cured by this...
Uh-huh.
ls no good he should work
when he is so sick.
l take you now
to make sure he don't.
l got a feeling l'm
heading for disaster.
With my help, never.
Mexico-o

You arrange that?
Some of my cousins.
Some of your cousins.
We'll live it up
and love it up, amigo
Life begins
When you're in
Mexico!
Hi.
Beautiful dive.
Gracias.
Glad you liked it.
Are you
the only lifeguard here?
Si, just me.
¿Raoul, como estas?
Así-así.
Mike, this is another
amigo, Moreno.
Moreno. A cousin?
No, Moreno is one champion diver
of all Mexico.
The champion diver.
He dives from the cliffs
at night, holding a torch.
136 feet.
Zoom!
You mean you work here
in the daytime
and you dive
from the cliffs at night?
Si.
When do you siesta?
l don't. No siesta.
An important man like you
has no siesta?
Mm-mm.
We go now, Mike.
Just a minute.
Hasta la vista.
Hasta la vista, Moreno.
Señor Ramirez,
this is my amigo, Mike.
Ah, claro!
-El cantante.
-Hello.
And what makes you think
he can fill in for El Trovador?
l heard him last night
at El Torito's.
They clapped like the thunder.
l got a real fan in Raoul.
lf you'll take a chance,
Mr. Ramirez
l won't let you down.
He'll make
your customers forget
all about the one
that gets sick all the time.
l don't know.
People who come to the big room
expect a big name.
So, we change your name
to a big name.
Well, better a bad show
than no show.
Oh, it won't be a bad show.
All right.
l'm crazy.
l'll take a chance.
How much you pay us?
Just a minute, Raoul.
l'll fill in for El Trovador
if you give me a job
as a lifeguard during the day.
No.
lt would be against the law.
l can pay you for singing
but l cannot pay you
for lifeguarding.
lt is impossible.
l'll tell you what, then.
l'll work as a lifeguard
during the siesta
for room and board, no pay.
That way, l'll be here to sing
when El Trovador is sick
and no law is broken.
l don't know.
Moreno wouldn't like it.
Can Moreno sing
when El Trovador is sick?
Maybe if l'm here, El Trovador
won't be sick as often, huh?
Okay. Check
with the desk clerk.
He'll assign you to a room, eh?
Thank you.
You're welcome
and thank you, Raoul.
Thank you, cousin.
Hasta luego.
l'd like to send
a telegram, please.
Certainly.
There you go.
''Mr. and Mrs. Jack Windgren
''2201 Robert Road,
Tampa, Florida.
''Dear Folks,
l am in Acapulco.
''lt might be the place
to solve my problem.
lntend to try.
Love, Mike.''
How much?
That'll be 25 pesos,
or two dollars.
You have a problem, Señor?
Anything l can do?
No, thank you.
Thank you.
Let's go to the beach.
All right, let's go.
Excuse me, l know
this is not the time
to talk business, but...
What kind of business?
Oh, please, go ahead.
l'm not a guest. l work here.
Then we've got something
in common
'cause l work here, too.
You do?
Yeah, that's what l want
to talk over with you.
See, the manager thinks
that you've been working
too hard.
So, he gave me a job
as your relief man.
Why are you so worried about me?
lt's only
during the siesta hours.
Look, Señor--
whatever your name is--
l told you l don't
take a siesta.
Oh. The name is Mike Windgren.
Marguerita Dauphin.
How do you do?
l don't know yet.
How do you think it looks
to the world
when the diving champion
of Mexico doesn't take a siesta?
The hotel is only trying
to protect him
and his reputation.
And how many hours
of reputation protection
does the hotel think l need?
Well, say from 1 :00 to 4:00.
We'll see about that.
We have laws, you know?
See you at 1 :00 tomorrow,
Moreno.
You, too, señorita.
l hope.
Hello.
Hi.
This is a nice surprise.
May l join you?
You got a reservation?
This table is, uh, kind
of small for two people.
lf you feel that way,
l can find another place.
Oh, no, no.
lt would be an honor.
Thank you.
What did you order?
l've forgotten.
My waiter went north
for the winter.
Be patient.
You're in Mexico.
They like to prepare food well,
it takes time
but it's worth waiting for.
You're not Mexican, are you?
No. Where are you from?
The United States.
l could tell that.
l wish that waiter would hurry.
l've got some rehearsing to do.
Did you say ''rehearsing''?
For lifeguarding?
No, l go on
for El Trovador tonight.
You're an entertainer
plus a lifeguard?
Why not?
Two jobs?
You are ambitious.
Say, what do you do around here?
l'm assistant social director.
Oh. l might just get over
being antisocial, then.
Thank you.
lt's good.
Hey, doc, is it catching?
Outrageous.
Vichyssoise must be served
at 40 degrees
not warmer and not colder.
He's only help,
not a paying customer.
Food is food for everybody.
Besides, he's also a guinea pig
for the paying customer.
Go on, get it changed
and get it right!
Hurry up!
''Must be 40 degrees.''
ls he always like that?
Usually worse.
He's got to be kidding,
the old goat.
He isn't kidding
and the old goat is my father.
Oh, l-l-l'm sorry.
Why didn't you introduce
me to the old goa...?
Why didn't you
introduce me to him?
l probably was waiting
for you to trap yourself...
and you did.
l see.
He'll be back.
Much better.
Exactly 40 degrees.
The king's had official tasters.
Why shouldn't l?
Good.
Papa, this is Mike Windgren.
How do you do?
Maximillian Dauphin, chief chef.
Your food's great.
Yes, l know.
Excuse me.
l have work to do.
-Oh, uh, sir.
-Hmm?
You might need this.
Oh, oh.
Thank you.
Modest, isn't he?
He's just stating a fact.
The king used to say
that he kept the best table
in the country.
The king came
to your restaurant?
Our castle.
Oh.
You see,
Daddy's really an amateur.
He was a grand duke
before our country went
behind the lron Curtain.
Well, then you must be
some kind of a duchess
or something.
No, call me Maggie.
All right, Maggie.
But what my father
would call you
isn't said
in polite company.
Why? What'd l do?
Rule of the house:
Finish your food.
Yeah, all right.
Mm-hmm.
We regret to announce that our
feature entertainer is ill...
...but to replace him tonight
we have been fortunate enough
to obtain the services
of that famous North American
singing sensation--
Mike Windgren!
There's a legend
of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought
as he had never done before
He could not beat El Toro
The bull, El Toro,
brought him defeat and pain
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...
And to his sorrow,
the matador knew shame
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...
They said time would never heal
the many scars
Brought by the great El Toro
And the bitterness that burned
deep in his heart
Caused him to hate El Toro
The bull, El Toro,
brought him defeat and pain
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...
And to his sorrow,
the matador knew shame
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...
Shame
-So one night
-Ooh...
-When no one was in sight
-Ooh...
-The matador
-Ooh...
-Went to settle the score
-Ooh...
-ln the lonely fields
-Ooh...
-Beneath the pale moonlight
-Ooh...
-He sought the bull
-Ooh...
-And they fought once more
-Ooh...
When they found the matador,
they saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now, they say that on the spot
where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro
The bull, El Toro,
brought him defeat and pain
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah...
Pain
-And to his sorrow
-Ah-ah-ah
The matador knew shame.
Ah-ah-ah-ah, shame.
Mike!
No pictures, please.
But Mike, publicity pictures
cost us nothing.
You heard what l said--
no pictures.
You were very good, Mike.
Thank you.
But that wasn't very nice.
l just don't like
having my picture taken.
l'm one of the FBl's
most wanted men.
Where are we going?
Stick with me.
l'll show you.
El Trovador
will be fully recovered
by the midnight show
after he hears about you.
Probably.
ls that what you do in the
States for a living, sing?
No.
l didn't think so.
Otherwise,
you would like photographers
but, uh, being lifeguard
is not a profession.
Now, look, princess...
''Princess--''
you've promoted me.
What did l do to deserve it?
lt's not what you did.
lt's what you're about to do.
Señor Mike?
Yeah.
You'll be singing
here from now on, no?
Uh, l don't think so.
Not regular, at least.
Too bad.
Dolores, she likes you.
Oh, Marguerita Dauphin,
Dolores Gomez.
l already know Miss Gomez.
You do?
By reputation.
How nice.
Hello.
You stay at this hotel, Mike?
Si.
How nice.
What are you doing, amigo?
Don't tell anybody, pal.
l'm learning to dive.
ls a little loco.
Well, like you say,
''the crazy gringo.''
Why don't you ask Moreno?
He's the best cliff diver
at La Perla.
La Perla?
Can anybody go and watch?
Why do you think they dive?
l'd like to go.
When?
Tonight.
Si. Tonight, you come with me.
Do it again!
Can l bring a friend?
lf you got to.
Hello.
Hi.
We're going to La Perla tonight.
Would you like to come along?
Sorry, l can't.
l have to work tonight.
But l have two hours off
for dinner
and the sunset
from there is beautiful.
Dinner it is, then.
No, we can have dinner here.
Otherwise, Papa would
never forgive me.
Whatever you say, princess.
And we'll go there
for a drink later.
Uh, 6:30 okay?
We don't see the dive then.
You're younger than l thought.
You see the difference
between watching divers
and having a pretty girl
show you the sunset...
Come to think of it, Raoul,
you don't have to come along.
l come along anyway...
unless you don't want me to.
-Of course we want you.
-Of course we want you.
First, l go finish my business.
Adios!
Adios.
Me, too.
See you later.
When you lifeguard,
you keep your eyes on the pool.
Now, Moreno...
you know nobody ever drowns
without first yelling, ''Help!''
Just because l let you work here
don't think l also
let you take my girl.
Your girl?
l think you forgot
to tell her that.
She's my girl,
and you keep away.
When she tells me that--
if she tells me that--
l might believe her.
Oh!
Oh...
l was asleep, you... you...
how you say?
You shake me up.
Yeah, you shake me up, too.
Can l buy you a drink?
What time is it?
lt's, uh, 4:00.
l'm off duty now.
Oh, l'm late for an appointment
at the beauty shop
but l have a drink
with you later, at 6:30.
Oh, l can't at 6:30,
l've got a date.
With our amigo here,
you don't make a date;
you make an appointment,
like at the beauty shop.
l go now.
l go now, too, Moreno.
Free! Free! Free!
Free! Free! Free!
Go to La Perla!
Could we have this table,
please?
Of course.
You crazy?
We see better from here.
Of course.
¿ Que va usted a beber?
Una margarita, por favor.
He's asking your name?
No, margarita is a drink
made with tequila.
Oh, good.
Well, any drink
named after you
is good enough for me.
Two margaritas, please.
Two margaritas.
¿ Y usted?
Cerveza, por favor.
Lemon soda for him, please.
Cerveza!
No beer.
Life is full of
disappointments, Raoul.
Lemon soda's for kids.
Lemon soda.
Lemon soda.
Margarita...
it sounds like it
was named after you--
mysterious, intriguing...
lt's also sneaky,
salty and dangerous.
Raoul, tell Mike about the dive.
What's to tell?
Later, we come back to watch.
Look!
Someone's going in the water!
An amateur.
He climbs too slow.
Are you all right, Mike?
Oh, me, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, l'm all right.
Good. l be right back.
Lady Maggie,
Señor Perez.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
Señor Mike Windgren.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
l told him you will sing, now.
''Marguerita.''
''Marguerita.''
You're pretty sneaky, amigo.
Have to get you job, Mike.
Have no chicken enchiladas
for a long time.
Excuse me.
Ah...
Who makes my heart beat
like thunder?
Who makes
my temperature rise?
Who makes me tremble
with wonderful rapture
With one burning glance
from her eyes?
Marguerita... ah... ah...
Ah... ah...
Once l was free as a gypsy
A creature too wild to tame
Then suddenly l saw Marguerita
And l was caught
like a moth in the flame
Marguerita...
Ah...
ls her name
Marguerita-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah...
Her lips have made me a prisoner
A slave to her every command
She captivates me
and intoxicates me
With one little touch
of her hand
Marguerita-ah-ah-ah-ah...
Ah... ah... ah...
Sweet Marguerita
Ooh...
Sweet, sweet Marguerita
Ooh... ooh...
Ooh...
Ah... ah...!
Throw it over.
Let's have some lemonade, amigo.
Si.
Jose... two lemonades, please.
Mike, what will you have?
On the house.
Oh, l'll have a...
a Marguerita. You.
Oh!
l'll have a lemonade,
too, please.
Three.
l enjoyed last night, Mike.
Thank you.
lf l seemed a little uneasy...
You did.
lt's because l haven't had
enough experience with girls.
l am sure.
Are you off duty or on?
This is my man break.
Man break?
What's a man break?
Well, in the United States
for the employees,
you have coffee break, no?
Yeah, but, uh...
But l don't drink coffee,
so l visit with a man.
That's a practical woman.
Actually, l have news
for both of you.
El Trovador is sick again.
l'm sorry to hear that.
And this time
he's sick for real.
¡Caramba! l had us set to sing
at the Ambassador Club tonight.
Well, l'm sorry, old buddy, l
can't be in both places at once.
lt's okay. l fix it.
Tonight, l bring the manager
of the Ambassador Club
here to hear you.
Same difference.
That's very clever of you,
Raoul.
Of course.
Why don't you come with me,
just for luck?
Sorry, l can't.
l have a date tonight.
Moreno?
What's with Moreno anyway?
He gets all shook up
every time he sees me
just talking to you.
Well, Moreno's been good to me
and he's fun.
So is a cocker spaniel.
But it's more than a Latin
temperament in him, isn't it?
And Señorita Dolores Gomez,
isn't she Latin, too?
Now, what's she got
to do with it?
l can come tonight
if you don't mind
Moreno coming with me.
That's okay, if you don't mind
Dolores coming along with me.
Please, Señor, Señorita,
it's very mixed up.
So will you say everything again
only this time in Spanish?
l present to you,
Señorita Dolores Gomez
and mi amigo
Señor Mike Windgren.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
Señor Delgado is the manager
of the Ambassador Club.
lt is a great honor, Señorita.
Gracias.
l shall look forward
to hearing you, Señor.
You go on soon.
Thanks.
And thank you
for coming over here.
Would you join us?
Muchisimas gracias.
But l will watch from the bar.
Con permiso.
Raoul...
l know, now l get lost.
Buenas noches.
May l take your order?
Tequila.
l'll have a margarita.
Uh... two tequilas.
Since you asked me
to come here tonight
l forgive you.
What's to forgive?
The other girl.
You like her, no?
l also like you.
How can you like Dolores
when you don't see
enough of her to know?
l've seen enough of her to know.
Mike...
Dolores, she likes you.
Thank you.
That's a beautiful ring.
lt belong to your husband?
l've never married.
Your sweetheart?
l have too many sweethearts
to wear their rings.
Excuse me, that's me.
Damas y caballeros...
again tonight we have
the great pleasure of presenting
the North American
with that exciting voice...
Mike Windgren!
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
¡Ole!
Pedro the bull was a killer
King of the bullfight arena
He'd wipe up the floor
with each brave matador
Then have matador stew
for his dinner
He heard the crowd
shouting, ''Ole!''
¡Ole!
But he met his master that day
The bullfighter was a lady
And it was true love
at first sight
Her red cape was waving
but Pedro was shaving
He wanted to date her that night
Ah...
Ah...
Ah...
¡Ole!
Pedro the bull, he was smitten
First time the love bug
had bitten
He once was a mad bull,
a wild and a bad bull
But now he was mild as a kitten
The people were starting to hiss
But Pedro just wanted to kiss
The bullfighter was a lady
And Pedro, he liked what he saw
He floated on air
with a rose in his hair
As he waltzed
with that sweet matador
His fate was a bad one
His tale is a sad one
lt's hanging right over...
Her...
-Door...
-Aah...
Aah...
Aah...
¡Ole!
-Bravo!
-Ole!
Bravo!
Bravo, bravo.
Thank you.
Ready to go?
We just got here.
lt's too hot in here.
l mean, it's too cold.
But... you wanted to come.
Hello, Princess.
Ah, buenos noches.
And good evening
to you, Señorita.
You're not leaving already.
Will you join us for a drink?
Thank you,
but l have to get home.
lt's too hot and
too cold in here.
Don't you think Mike was good?
ln which performance?
Why do you leave so soon?
We just start to have fun.
lt's time for a working girl
to be in bed.
ls there any special time?
l wish you would stay.
Sorry. Good night.
Good night.
Good night. Night.
Good night.
We just turned down
his very low offer.
What was the offer?
An insult.
But it was union scale.
ls no generoso, this man.
You don't expect me
to pay him top money.
''You don't expect me
to pay him top money''?
Tomorrow night we
try the Tropicana.
The manager isn't so cheap.
Nobody will pay more.
Chihuahua!
What's the use, pal?
l sing, they offer me
a job and you turn it down.
Tomorrow night's the last one.
Then we deal.
l hope you know
what you're doing.
-All the time.
-All the time.
Now, let's talk
about Dolores, hmm?
Ay-yi-yi, Dolores.
Ay-yi-yi, Dolores.
Why don't we go
out of here, hmm?
Okay. l'm with you.
lt's a lovely night, no?
Everything's so clear.
Very.
l will show you
a view of Acapulco
you never seen before.
ls, um, how you say,
Lover's Alley?
Lover's Lane.
Better known as a make-out spot.
Make-out spot?
l didn't know
you had them in Mexico.
You think
it's an American invention?
No, but l think we perfected it.
l have been all over
and love is no
difference everywhere.
l'm with you.
Do you want to get marry?
No man really wants
to get married.
Not even algun dia?
Algun dia?
Someday.
Oh, sure, someday.
l don't.
lf a Señorita wants
to cook and clean
and get fat, for her is okay.
But Dolores, she doesn't
want to wipe the nose
of a crying baby.
Now, wait a minute.
You're getting ahead of me.
l fight the bulls and...
sometimes l play house.
But the ring is
for the bull's nose.
Well, let's play house.
You want to be the
Papa in my house?
That's my best role.
Oh.
That's better, no?
No... oh!
Whoa!
La proxima ves traigo
mi camioneta.
Yeah. What?
Next time we'll bring
my station wagon.
This was gonna be
the night tonight
l was gonna get
to hold you tight
But l guess we didn't
plan it right
l never stood a chance
We couldn't dance
'Cause there's no room
to rumba in a sports car
You can't move forward
or back
There's no room to do
what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine
outta whack
And a little kiss
l want to steal
l hit my head against
the steering wheel
Now l know the way
a pretzel feels
All l can do is shout...
Hey, let me out!
'Cause there's no room
to rumba in a sports car
You can't move forward or back
There's no room to do
what the beat tells you to
Without throwing your spine
outta whack.
Afraid of the high one?
Don't worry about it.
lt's very easy.
lt must be--
you can do it.
Look, l'll show you.
Don't bother.
Good morning.
Sleep well?
Do l detect a cool breeze?
Of course not.
Uh, l've got an audition
again tonight.
-Will you come along?
-As a chaperone?
At the Tropicana Club.
Don't tell me you had enough
of the flavor of old Mexico.
lt may be
your last chance.
Raoul says
it's my last audition.
l hope it will be
memorable experience
Look, l don't want to go alone.
-Maggie...
-Why should you go alone?
There aren't any bullfights
until Sunday.
You know, when you're mad,
Princess, you remind me of...
Of you.
No, of El Toro, the bull.
Oh, you!
Mm...
You don't like me
in the daytime?
Uh, um, not in front
of all these people.
People?
What people?
Somebody might just walk
by any minute, you know.
You're ashamed for somebody
to see Dolores kiss you?
lt's a crime or something?
ln Acapulco?
Okay.
Mm!
Where you take me tonight?
l bring my big car.
Automatic transmission.
Well, uh, l'm not too
sure about tonight.
Uh, uh, l'm a little
nervous about a job.
And l'm late now.
l'll see you later.
Nervous?
ls good for the nerves.
l said, take it easy, baby,
l worked all day
And my feet feel
just like lead
You got my shirttails flyin' all
over the place
And the sweat poppin'
outta my head
She said, hey, Bossa Nova, baby,
keep on workin'
For this ain't no time
to quit
She said, go, Bossa Nova, baby,
keep on dancin'
l'm about to have myself
a fit
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
l said, hey, little mama,
let's sit down
And have a drink
and dig the band
She said, drink, drink, drink,
oh, fiddly-dink
l can dance
with a drink in my hand
She said, hey, Bossa Nova, baby,
keep on workin'
For this ain't no time to drink
She said, go, Bossa Nova, baby,
keep on dancin'
'Cause l ain't got time to think
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
l said, come on, baby,
it's hot in here
And it's oh-so-cool outside
lf you lend me a dollar,
l can buy some gas
And we can go for a little ride
She said, hey, Bossa Nova, baby,
keep on workin'
'Cause l ain't got time
for that
She said, go, Bossa Nova, baby,
keep on dancin'
Or l'll find myself another cat
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova
Bossa Nova.
Did you see who's out there?
Si, both of them.
What you do now?
Follow me, come on.
The crazy gringo.
How else am l supposed
to get out of here, huh?
That's how we came in.
You're too young
to understand, anyway.
Si, and when l get older,
l won't understand either.
Oh, yes, you will.
Oh, yeah, you will.
You know what you have
to do, amigo. So hurry.
lt's very low for an agent.
Come on, go!
l go, but l don't have
to like it.
Raoul.
Señorita, you are
very pretty tonight.
ls that what he
told you to say?
No, l say that.
He told me to tell you
to meet him outside pronto.
And he told you to tell
Señorita Dolores
she's also pretty tonight?
De todo corazón.
Just you.
Well, you can tell
your friend...
No, it's better you tell him.
l will.
Raoul, where is Mike?
This lady is Señorita
Dolores Gomez, the bullfighter.
Oh, l'm so excited.
lt's kind of like meeting
Mrs. Luce.
We don't meet many bullfighters
in Atlanta.
Gracias.
You have nice talk, yes?
Uh, tell us, Señorita
when do you fight
the bull again?
Next month in Mexico City.
Oh... now isn't that a
shame? We won't see it.
We leave for home,
day after tomorrow.
He wouldn't go anyway.
He gets sick
at the sight of blood.
Oh, Señorita,
if you do come to Atlanta
you must look us up.
Uh, here, it's, uh,
Dr. and Mrs. John Steeps.
l'm a surgeon.
Doctor?
And you can't stand
the sight of blood?
Oh, human blood
doesn't bother me.
Oh.
Oh, isn't she sweet?
Your matador is waiting
for you back there.
And the stubborn burro
is out here.
Out here and going home.
l asked you to
come over tonight.
And you ask her, too.
You won't believe
this, but l didn't.
You don't have any right
to be angry
not as long as that
saltwater Tarzan's around.
At least he doesn't make
a spectacle of himself
kissing her like that.
Oh, that.
That was just a reward
from Dolores--
maybe she liked the song--
and if you hated me
as much as you pretend
you wouldn't be angry at all.
How is that again?
l'll tell you about it later.
Now, we deal.
What? ln the middle
of the night?
Nobody civilized is up yet.
l am up.
You got no right to be.
Good night.
What's the matter with you,
amigo? lt's morning.
Did you meet both señoritas
after all?
You awake now?
No, l'm sound asleep.
What club you want to work in?
Do l have a choice?
The Tropicana, l guess.
We save that for the last, then.
La Perla, por favor.
La Perla.
Señor Perez?
Si.
l am manager of the singer,
Mike Windgren.
He's sorry
you couldn't afford him.
Another club offered more.
Who said we
couldn't afford him?
How much they're paying
him at the other club?
350 pesos.
We would have paid 500.
Thank you very much,
Señor Perez.
lf he changes my mind,
we let you know.
Ambassador Club, por favor.
¿Bueno?
ls Club Ambassador?
Si.
This is the agent
of Mike Windgren.
He is very sorry
you couldn't afford to pay him
what he was offered at La Perla.
What?!
We can't afford?
How much La Perla offered?
7 50 pesos.
Ha! We would have paid 1,000.
Now l'm not so cheap, eh?
Thank you very much, Señor.
You are muy generoso,
but not muy enough.
Tropicana, por favor.
Are you sure you're not
a 40-year-old midget?
Bueno?
Tropicana? Si.
ls speaking Raoul.
Raoul, manager of the singer,
Mike Windgren.
He is very sorry the Ambassador
offered more than you can pay.
He wanted to work for you.
And how much is the
Ambassador paying him?
1,250 pesos and all the cerveza
his agent can drink.
We will pay more.
How much more?
1,500 pesos.
lt's not very much more, Señor.
l think it's enough more.
And all the cerveza?
And all the cerveza
if the agent is old enough.
l call you back.
Tropicana offered 1,500 pesos.
ls that a lot of money here?
Over $100.
You get 7 50 pesos,
and l get 7 50 pesos.
You get half?
Si, only half.
That's kind of high for
an agent's commission.
l work all this time
for nothing.
Yeah, l know,
but 50% for a kid...
Look, Raoul...
l'm not a kid!
l'm your partner.
Well, l hope l don't have
to deal with you
when you're grown up.
l tell them
we start tonight, Mike?
No, wait, wait.
Wait? Why wait?
l'm not ready to
leave this job yet.
Mike, you could quit
lifeguarding.
You buy your own pool soon.
Tell the Tropicana
l'll start in two weeks.
Two weeks?!
You crazy, Mike?
Okay, one week.
One week? But, Mike...
You heard me, one week.
Okay.
So l starve
for one more week.
Tropicana, por favor.
Well, well, the
Tarzan of the South.
Good morning.
And the Casanova of the North.
What's troubling you today?
You. Again?
Don't you understand English?
Why do you see Maggie
when l told you...
That's right.
You told me. She didn't.
Who do you think you are
to come here and get
in everyone's way?
-Not everyone's, just yours.
-When do you leave?
l think my tourist card is
good for about six months.
The tourist card only applies
to live tourists.
So? Kill me.
Ay.
Dos daquiris.
The North Americanos
have an expression:
Busman's holiday.
Which means?
When a lifeguard has time off
and goes to another
swimming pool...
...he's loco.
Well, sometimes, it's nice
to have an assistant.
Ah. What's his name again?
Mike Windgren.
Very nice fellow.
Yeah, very nice.
Maggie likes him.
So does Dolores.
Everybody likes him.
lt doesn't bother you?
Why should it?
He was out with Dolores
until 3:00 in the morning.
3:22. lt was Wednesday.
Oh, l see,
he doesn't bother you.
Of course not.
He doesn't bother me, either.
Why should he...
even if Maggie does like him?
l am talking
with a friend of mine
from the States the other day.
Yes?
And he mentions
a funny coincidence.
Go on, Jose.
A family of the
same unusual name
was with a circus up there.
The Flying Windgrens.
Something happened to them.
Some tragedy.
Yes?
What else?
Nothing else yet.
This amigo of mine from
the States is very slow.
You know how they are
in the States.
Everything is mañana.
He will find out more?
lf he does, l tell you.
Mike!
l see you at the cabaña.
Hey, lindo dia, no?
Si... and your Spanish
is getting better.
Gracias.
Rub me, por favor.
Sure.
Where should l start?
Well...
Hi.
There's just no end to the
services the hotel provides.
Uh, life of a lifeguard.
lt's getting--
how you say--
like Grand Central Plaza.
More, Mike.
l want to have a party
to celebrate my last victory
in the bull ring
and since this is
your department, Señorita
you might arrange it.
On behalf of the hotel,
l thank you.
How many people will there be
when and how much money
would you like to spend?
l do not bother with details.
That is why l have Jose.
Jose!
Oh! Vengo.
¿ Si?
Jose, tell the
Señorita Social Director
about the plans for my party.
Party?
l want to have a party Saturday.
Saturday.
But that is tomorrow.
l know that, Jose.
How many people?
l don't know how many people.
You work it out with her.
Go. Go somewhere together.
Go plan it.
You will excuse us.
Rub me again, please.
Okay, yeah.
Good morning, Papa.
Good morning, my darling.
Aren't they pretty?
l'll let you know in a minute.
Mmm! They are pretty.
Mm, l've spent two hours
on them already.
Ooh, save some of them.
Señorita Dolores Gomez
is giving a party here
tomorrow night
and you are to cater
a very fancy buffet.
Oh, Dolores Gomez,
th-the bullfighter?
Oh, she's a very
beautiful girl.
lf you like beautiful girls.
l think she likes Mike.
So maybe we can poison her.
Hmm...
You like Mike better
than all the others, huh?
Maybe l live
to see a grandchild yet.
l'll start working
on it right away.
Oh-oh, you marry first,
young lady.
Oh, it won't be easy
to leave you, Papa.
Darling, who is talking
about leaving?
Higher mountains
l could use, too.
America is a vast wasteland
crying for the culture
of fine food.
The day of the hamburger
and hot dog is over.
Poor Papa, you don't know it
but Maxim's will soon be serving
hamburgers and hot dogs.
Nevertheless, a good chef
can get a job anywhere
and a genius with food
can be a hero
in a country
that just conquered its lndians.
The sky is the limit.
So, my genius, my hero
you are suggesting
that l marry Mike
so l can get to that wasteland?
Of course.
What about our visas?
Oh, darling, that's just it.
You marry Mike,
which gives you your visa.
l am your Papa,
the only living relative.
America is
a very sentimental country.
They will give me my visa, too.
l thought so.
Nothing matters but our visas!
Darling, if you love him,
what difference does it make?
Ah, now we're getting
around to love.
lf l love him
and if he asks
me to marry him...
lf, if, if, if.
l am too old for all these ifs.
lf.
Oh, Mike, l'm glad you're here.
What's the matter, princess?
You seem upset.
Oh, let's get away
from the hotel
for an hour or so.
Great. Where should we go?
Oh, anywhere,
just so we get away from here.
l'm with you.
What's the big problem?
Why are you so nervous?
lt's nothing important.
Sometime, l forget
what a difficult life
my father has had
and l lose my patience with him.
Royalty is rough.
lt has been for him.
Tough being the head
of a royal house
and to lose everything
and now have to work
in a kitchen.
l wonder if you
or l could have adjusted
as well as he has.
Well, you seem to have done it.
l'm younger than he is.
You're prettier, too.
Now, what about you?
How did you enjoy living
in the States?
l was a part of a circus
act with my family
and then the act
broke up on accou...
on account of an accident
and l couldn't go on with it.
l lost my nerve.
You can't blame yourself
for an accident.
l can--
it was my fault--
and then, when l got fired here
l thought this might
be the place to...
straighten myself out.
lf l do, well,
then l can go back
and pull the act together again.
lt's all my folks know.
l wish l could help you, Mike.
You can.
You can.
You can't say no
ln Acapulco
With every beat,
your heart will answer yes
Where lovers sing
instead of talk
And dance instead of walk
together
ln a night that's filled
with stars and strumming guitars
You can't say no
ln Acapulco
Where romance blooms
and love is in the air
So kiss me tender,
love me true
Darling,
feel this magic, too
Don't say no,
you can't say no
ln Acapulco
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
You can't say no
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh...
ln Acapulco
Where romance blooms
and love is in the air
So kiss me tender,
love me true
Darling,
feel this magic, too
Don't say no,
you can't say no
ln Acapulco
Don't say no,
you can't say no
ln Acapulco.
Tell Moreno to get ready.
Mike.
Good night.
''Good night''?
Are you leaving?
No, it's my party,
and l just got here.
Oh, well, then you
say, ''Good evening.''
Señor, you don't
understand Spanish.
''Buenos noches''
in English is ''good night,'' no?
Yeah, but, uh...
So, l say, ''Good night.''
Very funny.
Bravo! Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo!
Muy bien, hombre.
Gracias.
Muy bien.
Gracias.
She is in the kitchen
where she be...
Don't say it.
Okay, she doesn't belong
in the kitchen.
Beautiful party, Señorita.
And a beautiful dive
for my guests to enjoy.
Yeah, beautiful dive.
Thank you.
l hear that Señor Mike
can make beautiful dives, too.
Excuse me.
Hey, what's the matter, partner?
Aren't you enjoying the party?
Well, l worry about you.
l told you before,
but you don't listen.
What?
Girls are trouble, Mike,
and if l'm your partner
half the trouble is mine.
Well, like l told you before,
Raoul
you're too young to understand
about girls.
Ah, everyone say that
but l understand better
than you do.
What are you trying to say?
Maggie wants to go
to the United States
mostly to help her father.
She'd marry you to get there.
How do you know this?
l have a cousin who works
in the kitchen.
Amigo, if you know something...
As l was saying
l hear you can dive better
than Moreno can.
Ask him to dive
from the high board, Señorita.
Would you do it for me, Mike?
Moreno's the diver.
Let him dive.
Oh, he used to fly up there.
That's what they call him--
''Flying Windgren.''
That's what they call him--
''Flying Windgren.''
Now they just call him
''gallina''-- chicken.
ls this true, Mike?
lf he says so.
He seems to know more
about me than l do.
Oh, l know all about you,
Mr. ''Flying Windgren.''
They used to fly like birds...
until he lost his nerve
and dropped his brother...
killed his brother.
Now he's afraid to climb up
on the high diving board.
He shakes when he looks down.
You feel better, Moreno?
And for him l was willing
to bring my station wagon.
How long have you been
swimming and diving?
Ever since l was a little boy.
You are not a little boy
any longer.
How good it is for the body--
strong.
Mm-hmm.
Bullfighting is good
for the body, too
and it takes great courage.
You have courage, too, Moreno.
l hope won't disappoint you,
Señorita.
l tell you if you do.
Ah, it will be wonderful
to see New York.
And l always wanted
to see San Francisco.
Maybe we will.
And soon, too, hmm?
l hope so, Papa.
All America.
Ah-ah-ah.
What are you doing here?
Right now,
l think you need an amigo.
So, now you go home.
lt's not nice to read
other people's mail, Raoul.
l didn't!
l have a cousin
in the telegram office.
Blood is thicker than tequila.
l find another nobody
to build into a somebody.
Don't worry, Raoul,
l'm not leaving here yet.
l got something to do first.
But when l do go,
would you like to come with me?
Still partners?
Still partners.
lt's a deal.
Hi.
Hi.
You disappeared
early last night.
My visa was up.
l had to get it renewed.
Your visa at midnight?
l have to protect
my United States citizenship
for you, don't l, princess?
Not for me you don't.
Angry young men
soon develop ulcers.
ls that an old
European proverb?
Hmm. You North Americans
will never learn
to take your time with eating.
You're supposed to enjoy it.
We can always depend
on the foreigners
to point out our faults.
You are a foreigner here,
also, my friend.
What are you so angry about?
What kind of daughter
did you raise anyway?
A charming one, l hope.
Yeah, charm for using people.
She used you?
She tried.
lt didn't quite work.
She thought l was her
passport to the States.
You young people.
You are so overly sensitive.
By now you should know her
better.
lt was l who wanted
more than anything else
to spend my last days
in the United States.
And Maggie tried so hard
to please me.
Maybe l prodded her into
using you, as you put it.
Where is she now?
With the astronaut's party
at the La Perla.
Thanks, Pop.
l'll see you later.
Hey, you didn't eat your food!
Aah, that peasant.
Maybe she shouldn't marry him.
Oh, my friend,
are you rushing to fly--
forgive the expression--
back to your home?
And make your life a pleasure?
You know me better than that.
Oh, must be a very
important mission
that sends you off
in such a hurry.
lf you must know, l'm on my way
to La Perla to see your girl.
Oh, what a coincidence.
l'm going there, too,
to make a beautiful dive
for your North American
astronaut.
We can share a taxi.
Thanks, but no thanks.
The chicken wants to get to
the other side of the road.
You'd better move.
Why don't you move me?
You fight pretty good
for a coward.
Oh...
Oh! Oh!
Excuse me.
Hey, amigo,
l want to get in here.
So do all these people.
But my girl's in here.
So is your famous
astronaut.
After the dive, when he leaves
and the people clear out
then you'll be admitted.
lt may be too late then.
l'm sorry, Señor.
Mike!
What are you doing here?
Your astronaut,
all the important people
they come here
just to see Moreno dive.
You hurt him, Mike!
Will be no dive today.
Ladies and gentlemen
señoras y señores
in honor of our most
distinguished guests
we present the champion diver
of them all, the great Moreno!
Señoras y señores
en honor de nuestros
distinguidos huespedes...
...el gran Moreno!
What are you doing?
You crazy?
Maybe.
We'll soon find out.
Mike, you'll get killed!
Mike, you did it!
You're not crazy after all.
Now l can go home to Florida.
You still want to come along?
Si! Si!
Partners?
No. Amigos.
Here's Mike.
Asi, asi, muchacho.
Hey, Mike!
l hear you take my job away.
Here we go, Mike.
Felicitationes.
Congratulations.
Anyone who can dive like that
is not a coward.
lt's the best dive l ever made.
Congratulations again.
Thanks, champ.
You also have a hard jaw, amigo.
Congratulations.
Bravo.
Uh, that was just a reward
from Dolores, that's all.
Can anybody get in the act?
Only the regular customers.
