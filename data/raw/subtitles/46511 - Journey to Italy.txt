VOYAGE TO ITALY
Where are we?
Oh, I don't know exactly.
How far is it to Naples?
About a hundred kilometers, I think.
Do you mind if I drive?
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep otherwise.
Alright. Fine. If you wish.
Did you see that? It's incredible
the way some people drive here.
Like madmen.
They should amuse you.
What noisy people. I've never seen
noise and boredom go so well together.
Oh, I don't know. Uncle Homer lived
here for 40 years without getting bored.
Uncle Homer was
not a normal person.
I must write to my mother.
How long do you think we'll be here?
Only a few days.  If what that Burton
fellow wrote me is true, we shouldn't...
...have any trouble disposing of the property.
I'd never have come on this trip
if I didn't think we could...
...clean up this inheritance
mess in no time.
Well you know that Burton. He seems
to be such an, an attentive...
...orderly person. How would he be
such a good friend of Uncle Homer's?
I can't say. I only know that he
was with him for a number of years...
...and that Uncle Homer
trusted him completely.
Oh, is... is that a streak of blood?
No, that's just a bug,
squashed against the glass.
The air is full of insects.
Do you think there's any
danger of catching malaria?
They say not.
You know, I was just thinking what
a fool I was, 3 months ago in London.
It would have been so easy
for me to solve the Louis deal.
There were at least three solutions
that were better than the one I chose...
...and I just couldn't think of them.
And you think of them now?
Now they seem very clear to me.
Ah, but what a shame John and
Dorothy couldn't come with us.
Yes, it is.
If only you'd listened to me, we
could have come by plane. We would
have been back home a week ago.
But I wanted you to take a rest.
It didn't occur to me that it would be
so boring for you to be alone with me.
What's that got to do with it? I'm just
bored because I've got nothing to do.
This is the first time that we've been
really alone, ever since we married.
Yes, I suppose it is.
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, madam.
Good evening, sir.
Uh, good evening. We have a
reservation under the name of Joyce.
Yes, Mr. Joyce.
Will you come this way, please?
- Good evening Mrs. Joyce. Good evening, sir.
- Rooms 317 and -18.
Follow me, please.
Excuse me, sir.
There is some mail for you.
Oh thanks.
Good evening, sir.
Shall we have something to drink?
Yes, but not here. Let's
go down to the bar.
At least there'll be some
other people around.
Why? Would it be so terribly boring
if we were to remain alone?
No, I was thinking of you. I don't 
think you're very happy where we're alone.
Are you sure you know when I'm happy?
No. Ever since we left on this trip,
I'm not so sure.
I realize for the first time that we...
we're like strangers.
That's right. After 8 years
of marriage...
...it seems we don't know
anything about each other.
At home, everything
seemed so perfect.
But now that we're away and alone...
Yes, it's a strange discovery to make.
- Yes, sir.
- Will you send off this wire, please?
- At once, sir.
- Thank you.
Now that we're strangers, we can
start all over again at the beginning.
Might be rather amusing,
don't you think?
Let's go down to the bar.
- Well, I don't see why...
- Oh, look!
- Judy! How nice to see you.
- Hey! Alex! Katherine!
- Are you here?
I've been here for the day. I've been
living in Capri for the last 3 months.
But what are you doing here?
Just a business trip.
Yes, a pleasure trip too.
Oh, how nice. Look, we're just going
to dinner. Won't you join us?
- Oh, this is Leslie Harris.
- How do you do?
- Miss Restelli and Paul Dupont.
- Hello.
- Hello. Miss Sinibaldi
and Miss Notari.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Well, uh, shall we have a drink first?
Yes, come on. Have a
drink with us, huh?
I never dreamt I would,
I would run into you here.
Angelo, a glass of mineral water.
You know she broke her
leg a month ago?
We brought her to Naples to
have the cast removed.
She'll be alright again tomorrow.
A dry martini.
Let's hurry with those drinks.
I'm starving.
Wake up, Alex. 
Wake up.
It's terribly late.
I called that man, Mr. Burton.
He'll be here in a little while
to take us to the house.
Wake up! It's late!
I must say, one sleeps well
in this county.
I was dreaming about something.
I can't remember what it was.
Maybe the charming Judy we were
so lucky to meet last night.
Maybe.
I've never seen you in such good
form. Do you know her well?
Yes. Well, I must get up.
Any tea?
It's on its way up.
How silly of me:
I never realized you were so
interested in other women.
Oh you didn't, ay?
Hello? Oh, tell Mr. Burton that
we'll be down in a few minutes.
And send up a porter. Thank you.
He's already here.
There are two people who are
interested in buying the property.
Too bad you want to sell it, though.
It's such a beautiful place.
Yes, so I understand.
But we must sell.
I've become very fond of the place.
You see, I arrived there during the war.
It was all locked up, practically deserted.
The moment I saw it, I requisitioned 
it immediately. It kept it from being
robbed and ruined.
One day, Uncle Homer arrived. He
had taken refuge in Capri...
...where he was constantly being
watched by the police...
...practically interned, poor fellow.
That's right. We had no news from
him for the whole duration of the war.
It was madness to want to
stay here in an enemy country.
Oh, I don't think he had such a
bad time in Capri, really.
He had many friends.
Everybody liked him.
Homer was the kind of a man you,
you couldn't help liking, you know?
After the Allies had broken
through the Gothic line...
...I was transferred to Venice.
That's where I got engaged.
Homer had become just... just like
a father to both of us.
Ah! There's the house right up there.
The white one.  Do you see it?
They're here!
Madam, they've arrived.
-  Welcome. 
- Welcome.
-  Welcome. 
- This is Natalia, my wife.
- How do you do?
- Please go on in.
I'll take care of the baggage.
Please come in.
This way, please.
You see, this is one of the drawing
rooms where your uncle dined when he had guests.
And we used to set up a
large table right here.
I never knew my uncle
had such good taste.
And now this way, please.
Oh, this is beautiful, isn't it?
Oh, in there are the kitchen and
the pantry. Please.
Look at her, Tony.
Doesn't she look like Lydia?
Oh no, I don't think so.
The profile. Much better
looking, of course.
Aren't they lovely?
Those are French porcelains.
Tea the old Paris way.
Come! I want you to see the terrace.
There's the Vesuvius. Ever since
the eruption of 1944...
...there's been a period of calm. Ah,
but the temperature is beginning
to rise a little, though.
That white back there, behind the
hill, that first hill, is Pompeii.
There's Castellammare...
...Torre Annunziata...
...Resina is over there.
And Naples... There's Ischia...
...the isle of Capri. And that large
strip down there is the, uh, Sorrento peninsula.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Oh yes.
- Right.
This way, please.
A Neopolitan painter of the 19th
century. Palizzi. Quite famous.
Here, we have sunshine all day long.
It was your Uncle Homer's
favorite corner.
And here are your bedrooms.
And this will be your
room, Mrs. Joyce.
Oh, very nice.
- Ah, the baggage.
 Put it here, eh?
- Thank you.
Good.
Are you having your lunch here?
Yes.
I'll have things ready in an hour.
Thank you very much.
Do you like it?
Yes, delicious.
Of course, if you're going to
stay here for a while...
...we'll have to do something
about getting servants for you.
Well, if you can find somebody.
Just for a few days.
Only a few days?
We can't stay very long. Our
government doesn't make it possible...
...for us to stay abroad for very long.
10 pounds a day for a month, you know.
Yes, I know. I was very lucky.
I came here right after the war...
...as soon as I got out
of the army.
Then we got married.
This wine is excellent.
Then Uncle Homer gave us
hospitality here in the hunting lodge.
I found something to do in Pompeii.
The excavations, you know.
I had taken a course in archeology.
You, you must come out there someday.
We certainly will. I'm so anxious
to see Pompeii.
I don't seem to be able to quench
my thirst.  How about you?
Me? No. Did you notice, I
hardly touched the food?
I can't understand what it is.
Perhaps it's all this garlic and oil.
I've quaffed down a
whole bottle of wine.
- Watch yourself. It might
make you ill.
- No.
Where's everybody gone to?
I heard somebody talking inside the house.
I think I'll go and see
what's going on.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
I'm sorry to trouble you.
Well, uh... I'm terribly thirsty.
It's this food, you know.
I'm not used to all those sauces.
 But what do you want?
Something to drink.
If you're feeling sick, go
have a bicarbonate.
Eh, well, but I just want
you to fill it up.
I understand. You're feeling sick.
But what do you want me to do?
This wine is excellent, you know.
But I'd just like you to fill it up.
Take a bicarbonate. I can't give you
one. I don't have any.
But, uh, you misunderstand me.
I want, I want to fill it up with wine.
He doesn't understand you.
What confusion!
Take him to Signor Tony. He will
understand what he's saying! Go!
Okay. We don't have any.
Come with me.
Come! Come!
How dare you speak to me like that.
Come with me to Signor Tony.
Come! Come!
Come. Come with me. I don't
want to be responsible for this.
 Yes, what is it?
Excuse me. The gentleman doesn't 
understand me. He's feeling sick.
I think he wants a bicarbonate.
She says she doesn't understand you.
I'm dying of thirst.
I'd like to have a drink.
The gentleman would like some wine.
How am I supposed to understand
him? Waving that bottle around! I thought he was sick.
Obviously, the poor woman couldn't
understand you.
It seems you weren't making
the right gestures.
Well what gestures should I make?
- Well...
- Picking up a bottle, you
should do like this.
- Yes.
Well, what do I do for a bottle
of mineral water?
That's simple.
The gentleman would like
a bottle of mineral water.
Alright?
I'll close it.
Everybody's asleep. It might be
the middle of the night.
Are you asleep too?
Almost. Oh, it's so nice in the sun.
Why don't you sit down too?
Temple of the spirit. No longer
bodies, but...
...pure ascetic imagenes.
Do you remember poor Charles?
Charles who?
Charles Lewington.
Lewington?
He died two years ago.
Oh, and uh, you just heard about it?
No, I knew the day after his death.
Two years ago.
Lewington. I don't seem to be
able to remember the fella.
Where did we meet him?
At the Hoooper-Smiths.
Was he a lawyer?
No. No, he was a poet.
He was thin, tall, fair...
So pale and spiritual. He was
stationed here in Italy during the war. 
Right here, as a matter of fact.
Oh, yes, I think I remember him.
He was at, uh, one of, um, Arthur's concerts.
He had a fit of coughing and had
to leave the auditorium.
Oh yes, he was very ill. 
Something he caught during the war.
You know, that young man started
me thinking about something.
About what?
That you can learn more from the
way a man coughs than from the way he speaks.
What did Charles's cough tell you?
That he was a fool.
He was not a fool. He was a poet!
What's the difference?
Charles wrote some wonderful poems.
I must get one of his books.
Well you won't find any. He was too
young to have any of his books published.
Then how did you know about them?
He read them to me. 
I even copied some.
Temple of the spirit, no longer
bodies but pure...
...ascetic images, compared to
which mere thought seems...
...flesh, heavy, dim...
He wrote them here in Italy,
while he was in the war.
I never knew you were
such great friends.
Oh, I knew him before I met you.
Were you in love with him?
No. But we got on terribly well
together. I saw a great deal of him at Copping Farm.
Then he got desperately ill.
I couldn't even visit him.
For almost a year, I didn't see him.
Then on the eve of our wedding...
...the night before I left for London.
I was packing my bags when I heard a sound...
...of pebbles on my window...
And the rain was so heavy that
I couldn't see anyone outside.
So I ran out, into the garden,
just as I was.
And there he stood.
He was shivering with cold. 
He was so strange and romantic.
Maybe he wanted to prove to me
that in spite of the high fever...
...he had braved the rain to see me.
Or maybe he wanted to die.
How very poetic. Much more
poetic than his verses.
Alex! Alex, may I take the car?
Why yes, of course, go ahead.
- Good morning, Mrs. Joyce.
- Good morning.
Where are you going?
To Naples.
Well what's your hurry?
No, I'm in no hurry.
Well what is it then?
Well if you need the car
I can borrow Mrs. Burton's.
I've already told you I don't need the
car. I'm waiting here to see the people...
...that are interested in buying the
villa, and I think it might be a good idea if you were here too.
Oh, but why?
Well, I don't know, I think it might
be a good idea. You can leave after they've seen it.
No, then I'd be too late.
I want to go to the museum...
...and they close at 4 o'clock.
I, I don't want to miss anything.
Aren't you going to have some lunch?
I've had a sandwich.
Well, I better get started.
Is this the museum that your friend,
uh... What was his name?...
...described in his verses?
Maybe.
I hate him.
The brute!
Watermelons, very fresh and cheap!
He thinks he understands life. He
ought to be punished for his pride, his self-assurance.
Ah, this must be it.
Come! Come up to clean!
'Morning. Do you have a guide, Madam?
No. I haven't got one yet.
Do you wish to visit the art gallery?
Yes, that would be fine.
- Very well. Did you buy a ticket?
- No.
You go inside. I'll get the
ticket. Just a second.
This way, please.
Many years ago, this was
a cavalry barracks.
In 1700, King Charles made
a museum of it.
The museum is very important.
At one time, there were secret
rooms, with paintings of Pompeii.
There are groups of sculptures here
from many famous collections:...
...Capodimonte, Herculano, Pompeii, and so forth...
This is the famous group of dancers.
They were found in a villa at Herculano.
Observe the harmony of their movements.
The fourth one looks just
like my daughter, Marianna.
This satyr was in the villa at Pompeii.
It is a pagan divinity that
was found in the woods.
It is a good thing they exist no
longer. They were very dangerous.
This is the drunken faun.
He is about to fall asleep.
Sleep is a wonderful habit.
Here, we have a young discus
thrower. A Greek.
And here are the emperors.
This is Caracalla.
Be built the famous public baths in
Rome. He killed his brother...
...right in his mother's arms.
This is Nero. You must have
heard of him.
He had the face of a baby,
but he was a madman.
He burned Rome and killed his
whole family, even his mother.
Tiberius. He spent almost all his life
on the isle of Capri, because he liked to live well.
He was a little crazy too.
He used to feed his slaves to the
fishes. Funny emperors, don't you think, lady?
This is the Venus I like most.
She is not as young as the others.
She is more... more mature.
Don't you agree, lady?
Perhaps. I wouldn't know.
And over here is the marvelous
Farnese Hercules.
It was found in the Baths
of Caracalla in Rome.
It is over ten feet tall, and two
thousand, two hundred years old.
It shows Hercules resting on a club.
It looks like everybody takes
a rest around here except me.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Down there is the
famous Farnese bull...
...carved out of a
single block of marble.
It's over 12 feet high. And it was
restored by Michelangelo.
It's said to be the largest
marble group in the world.
This group represents 
the sons of Antiope...
...Amphion and Zethus, who
to avenge their mother...
...tied the cruel Queen Dirce to
the horn of an angry bull.
To think that those men lived
thousands of years ago...
...and you feel that they are
just like the men of today.
It's amazing.
It is as if Nero or, or Caracalla,
Cesar or Tiberius...
...would suddenly tell you what
they felt.  And you could understand exactly what they were like.
Then they're not ascetic figures.
No, not at all. Poor Charles. He had
a way all his own of seeing things.
What struck me was the
complete lack of modesty...
...with which everything is
expressed. There was absolutely no attempt to-
- Come in.
- Come in.
I'm so sorry to trouble you, but an
old friend of your Uncle Homer
phoned, his dearest friend, in fact...
...the Duke of Lippoli.
He would like to meet you.
'Course I told him that you weren't at
home and could he please call later.
Oh, well, when he calls again,
I'd like to talk to him.
- Might be rather fun to meet him.
- Yes.
- Very good, then. Good night.
- Good night.
Let's go and eat.
Why don't we try to enjoy our vacation?
Well if we don't, it's your fault.
You don't realize how mean
you can be sometimes.
It's more than anyone can stand.
Did those people come to see the house?
Yes.
What did they decide?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
They're going to make me
an offer on Thursday.
What kind of people were they?
Rather talkative.
What... What was that?
How dare you say that!
Quiet! Get out of here!
They're getting married in a week
and they're always fighting.
It's jealousy.
How could anyone be jealous
before marriage?
Well, the time just before marriage
is a very delicate one. Oh!
- Duque de Lippoli? 
- Yes.
- Second floor.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- Good evening.
Very happy to meet you.
- Hello.
- How do you do? 
- Please, do come in.
- Please.
I'm so glad you could come.
We've been looking forward to meeting you.
I didn't know Homer
had such a beautiful niece.
These are all friends of Homer.
I want you to meet the Duchesses...
...of Montalban...the Duke of
Marino. Come, Mrs. Joyce.
Would you like something to drink, Mr. Joyce?
And may I introduce the Count and
Countess of Trebisonda, Prince and
Princess Melissa...
...Mrs. Joyce.
- Won't you sit down, please.
- Thank you.
That old joker Homer...
...kept it a secret that he had
such a beauty in the family.
- He had a mania for keeping secrets.
- Even his death.
Yes. We found out about it quite a
while after he'd been buried.
We'll get even with him up there someday.
We'll pay him a surprise visit.
And I bet he'll pretend to be
really surprised.
What an unusual home you have.
And so comfortable.
That sounds to me like
one of those compliments...
...that hide the usual reproach:
Dolce far niente.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
How do you say in English,
Dolce far niente?
It is impossible to say it in English.
Perhaps I could translate it,
"How sweet it is to do nothing."
Oh, I understand.
They say that all Neopolitans
are loafers.
Now I'd like to ask you: Would you
say that a shipwrecked man is a loafer?
In a certain sense, we're all shipwrecked.
You have to fight so
hard just to keep afloat.
Well, it looks like a very
pleasant shipwreck to me.
Especially when I
look into your eyes.
They're like stars in the night.
Do you like Naples?
Well, I haven't seen very much yet.
When did you arrive?
Three days ago.
Did you come by plane?
No, we, uh, motored down.
Like something to drink?
Alright.
Brandy?
Yes, please.
Have a good time?
No.
That's strange. It's a long time
since I've seen you in such a good mood.
You seemed pretty gay yourself.
Well, what did you want me to do, look bored?
Why don't you admit that you
did have a good time?
I don't even want to talk about it.
All those Italians milling around you.
What were they doing, telling you
funny stories?
Jealous?
Is that what you think?
Ever since we realized how little we
meant to each other, you...
...you've done everything you could
to make things worse.
And what about you? You haven't
said a word or made a gesture...
...to try to save what little is left
of our marriage.
But why should I make the effort all alone?
Because it's your fault. 
The whole thing is your fault.
I think you ought to know that it
didn't take me long after we were married to realize what was wrong.
There was always criticism in your
eyes, criticism until it crushed me.
Nonsense. But it is rather surprising
to hear you say that what I felt was important to you.
What do you mean?
Exactly what I say. You accuse me of
criticizing you. Well, it isn't true.
'Course there are a few things
which I don't like about you.
I know that.
Your lack of a sense of humor,
your ridiculous romanticism.
But when I was reduced in rank from
your wife to a mere hostess for your friends...
...then to handling your public
relations, you seemed quite pleased.
Now look, I don't want to talk
about this anymore.
You know, I'm getting absolutely
sick of this crazy country. 
It poisons you with laziness.
I want to get back home.
Back to work.
Oh, at last that big word. I haven't
heard you mention it for some time: "work."
I expect you to be talking about duty next.
Do the words "work" and "duty"
mean nothing to you since you've been here?
Don't be a hypocrite.
Now that's enough. I think the best
thing for us is to stay away from one another.
I'm going to Capri to wait there for
the answer of the people that are interested in the house.
I'm sure you'll find Capri terribly
exciting, now that your friends are there.
Now you have such lovely friends.
Alex!
To Capri. To have a good time.
If he thinks he can make me jealous...
- Who died?
- Don Pasquale. A good man.
He thinks I'm going to give in.
Think's I'll run after him.
He's mistaken.
I've learned a great deal from him.
He'll see.
He'll see.
To the left of the Acropolis
is the cave of the Sibyl.
After the Greeks and the Romans,
this place was transformed into a fortress.
Ah, a fortress.
Yes, a fortress, that's what I said.
After abandoning...
...the ancient city of Troy, Aeneas
landed here on this very beech.
In the last war...
...the British troops landed here.
Really? British troops landed here?
Yes, right here.
And where did they stay?
All around here.
This is the entrance to the caves
of the Sibyl, the Cumaean Sibyl.
Oh, but it's enormous!
Listen to the echo.
Yes, I hear it. Wonderful.
In ancient times, you could 
hear it much louder...
...when the walls were
covered with bronze.
It's extraordinary.
Now at the end, there are
the rooms of the Sibyl...
...and these were her baths.
This way, lady.
The Christians made them over
into catacombs.
You see lady, it is here that
lovers came...
...to question the Sibyl,
when they wanted to know...
...what the course of
their love would be.
Temple of the spirit,
no longer bodies...
... put pure ascetic imagenes.
Lady... Lady... Don't you want to
visit the rooms of the Sibyl?
No, thank you. Some other time.
Excuse me, lady. You see these holes?
It is there that the Saracenes
tied their prisoners.
Allow me. This is the way they would
have tied a beautiful woman like you.
What's this crazy woman doing
Where is the temple of Apollo?
It's up there. But I'm not coming, 
it's too windy.
Goodbye.
Silly old fool.
All men are alike.
I hate you. Cynical. Cruel.
Anything needed here? Have a
sandwich, Judy? Some more?
And for you?
Thank you.
There.
When I decided to leave my
husband, I had no problems.
The only important
thing was my freedom.
You seem to have a lot of problems,
a lot of questions on your mind.
It's because you love her,
and you're jealous.
Jealous?
- What time is it, darling?
- 10:30.
10:30? It's late.
Come on, everybody.
We have a rule here never to
go to bed later than 10:30.
Oh. Well, thank you... very much.
I had fun.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Come on, honey.
- Come along, now.
- Let's go.
- Thanks for coming, Alex.
- And you must come again sometime, ay?
Thanks for the party.
Good night.
- Hey, wait for me.
- Well come on, then.
- Good night.
- Bye.
- Are you taking Marie home?
- Yes, of course.  
Alright. Good night.
Do you mind if I lean on you?
No, not at all.
Thank you.
Do you want to go home right away?
Yes. What a beautiful sky.
Yes, it is.
It's a pity that I can't
leave my window open.
- Night air is bad for me.
- Oh.
But I leave the shutters open.
And when I wake up in the night...
...I can see the stars
through the window.
Well, that's a very lovely way
to look at the stars.
This is where I live. Good night.
Shall I see you tomorrow?
-  Oh yes.
-  What time?
At... eleven?
- Alright.
- Good night.
- Good night.
This way, Madam, please.
This little crater formed
during the last eruption.
You can see the boiling lava. On this
part, Madam, the crust of the earth is only 12 feet thick.
But isn't it dangerous?
No. Now I'll show you something very
interesting, the mystery of ionization.
What is it? What does it mean?
Well, it's a very
interesting phenomenon.
If you will watch now, I'll show you.
All you have to do is light a torch and the smoke increases everywhere...
...not only where we are now...
...but in all the craters.
Wait, I must take a photo for my husband.
Yes, yes, as you wish, Madam.
I'm ready.
There, here we are. 
Now you see. Look!
- Look at the smoke in that corner.
Did you see what a cloud of smoke?
- Yes, that's right!
- The smoke increase is not only here...
- And way over there, too.
- ...but everywhere, all over the hill.
Oh, that's...that's incredible!
Extraordinary.
Isn't it? And look over there.
Observe down here.
All right now: stand over there, please.
And now, Madam, I'll show you the
same effect of ionization produced by a cigarette.
Yes, feel the heat at this opening.
- And now, watch. Watch!
- It's hot.
Now look. Look. 
You see? Not only here but all over.
All over the hill, at the same time.
The smoke increases
over all the area.
Once more.
May I try?
- Of course, try yourself.
Let me hold it.
- Thanks.
This way, Madam, please.
This is another site you must not
miss. This is the small Vesuvius...
...called "the Pocket Vesuvius."
It is one of the most interesting
spots in this area.
In that corner, there are the boiling
cinders and lapillus. You'll see.
 Young man, come here. Stir there.
Now look at that corner. Look, look!
The lapillus, you see?
- Pompeii, you know, was destroyed
by a rain of burning lapillus and cinders.
- Like these?
Exactly. And now, if you will come
this way. Follow me, please.
Good morning!
Bonjour! I'm a little late.
It doesn't matter. I'm very patient.
Where are we going?
Well, would you like to go for a little walk?
It'd be good for my leg.
Which way should we go?
- Let's go this way.
- Alright.
Feeling better?
Yes, thank you, although I slept
very little last night.
Oh? Why?
Oh, I don't know. I feel
so alone in my house.
It seems kind of dead without
that disorder or something...
...that a man leaves behind.
The doors and the closets
creek strangely...
...seem to make sounds
I never heard before.
And even the noises outside
seem louder, clearer.
Footsteps in the streets...
...or, or a voice, or a child shouting,
or a radio in the distance.
Fate is really strange. Such a big
world. To think that I might never have met you.
You know, when I first saw you,
I hardly noticed you.
And now, your happiness is
really quite important to me.
But I am happy. Very happy.
Everything is alright
with my husband now.
I've been so nervous for the past few days.
You can't imagine the
letters we wrote each other.
You see, he doesn't
write very much but...
...when he wants to really hurt
someone, he can do it with one phrase.
But everything is alright, now.
He is coming back to Capri tonight.
- They'll bring the hot water for
your tea right away.
- Thanks.
Did you have an interesting day?
Oh yes, very.
Did you see anything new?
Well, I saw the sulfur springs.
Strange place, isn't it? Tell me, did
you imagine that Naples was like this?
Oh, I can't say. Not quite as
it is, perhaps.
You haven't the faintest idea
what Naples is like.
I must show you.
Tomorrow, if you wish, we can go
together to visit the Fontanelle.
What is that?
It's a... it's a catacomb, where they
gather skeletons from ancient cemeteries.
Sounds very dismal.
Dismal? Quite the contrary.
These are the skeletons of people...
...who died two, three, and even four
hundred years ago. Can you imagine?
I don't think it sounds very amusing.
But that's because you've
never been to the place.
You wouldn't believe it but
quite a few people go there.
There are many people
who have chosen a skeleton...
...assembled it properly,
take care of it lovingly...
...bring fresh flowers every so often, 
and keep a lamp in front of it.
But what is the meaning of all that?
Oh, it's pity, I guess.
These poor dead are
abandoned and alone.
They have no one to look after them, 
no one to pray for them.
Well, I don't understand.
I just can't understand it.
I know, it's difficult to understand
but... but you'll see for yourself.
That must be the boat from Capri.
Oh yes, that must be it. Is your
husband coming back tonight?
Oh, I don't know. I don't think so.
He didn't phone me. Oh, I have a
terrible headache.
Ah, it's the siroco.
The dampness in the air.
Now if... if they would bring me the
water for my tea, I could take an aspirin.
I'll see what's delaying them.
There doesn't seem to be much that
a foreigner can do to amuse himself in this town.
There are a few nightclubs, sir.
Yes, I've tried them but, uh, I'm
not much impressed.
Did you visit the one on the left as
you go out of the hotel, about two blocks?
No, I haven't seen that one.
There is a floor show there.
It's a little better than the rest.
I must investigate.
How much do I owe you?
That will be 3000 liras, sir.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Do you want me?
I'm afraid I don't understand Italian.
Okay.
You shameless, brazen hussy.
What did you say? If you speak fast,
I don't understand.
Slowly. What did you say?
Oh nothing. Nothing important.
Cigarette?
Thanks.
Two night ago, a friend died.
A woman friend.
32 years old.
In a nightclub. She put her head
on the table. And she died.
But how? What of?
It was her heart. She had
a baby 7 months ago.
I'm sorry.
If you didn't call me just now...
...I think I would have
thrown myself into the sea.
Isn't that a little extreme?
Maybe, but it is what
I would have done.
Now look here. After all, 
there are lots of-
Listen. Where do you want to go?
To your home?
Are you in a hotel?
Where do we go?
Nowhere. Just forget it. I'll 
take you for a drive...
...and then I'll drop you off
wherever you want to go.
Alex!
Alex! 
Yes? What is it?
I... I just wanted to
make sure it was you.
Who did you think it was?
I was sound asleep. I... I had so 
much sun and air today that I was...
...dead tired.
I fell asleep almost immediately.
How well one sleeps here.
Well uh, then uh...
I... I woke up with a start when
I heard a noise. I didn't know...
I... I didn't know that
you were coming back tonight.
Well as you see, here I am.
Did you have a good time?
Not bad.
What boat did you come back on?
The one that leaves at 5:00.
Oh. 5:00? What did you do until now?
- I was in Naples.
- Oh.
Anything else you want to know?
Of course not.
Then I... have your permission
to go to bed?
Of course.
Thank you. Good night.
Good night.
Will you do me a favor?
Yes.
Have someone call me at
11:00 tomorrow morning.
And don't let anyone
disturb me until then.
I haven't been sleeping very
well the last few nights.
Alright.
- Good night.
- Good night.
I can't remember if I was supposed
to wake Alex before leaving.
I guess not, though. He said
something about wanting to sleep until 11:00.
Sleep is always good for one.
Let him sleep.
Oh, by the way, did he enjoy Capri?
Not very much, I'm afraid.
Oh, what a beautiful Madonna!
Ah, there's some marvelous ones.
Oo, let me tell you about a foreigner...
...who was standing on the sidewalk
one day here in Naples.
Suddenly, he noticed that everybody
was tipping their hats...
...and waving to him. He couldn't
understand his sudden popularity...
...until he realized he was standing
in front of one of those Madonnas.
How many expectant mothers you see here.
There are hundreds of them
in the streets of Naples.
Count them in this space alone.
2...3...4...5... and
another one down there: 6.
Now I'm sorry I took the car.
Maybe he needed it.
Oh, look there. Look at that donkey.
Oh, what a load he's carrying, and he's so little.
But they're very strong.
It's a tough breed.
The food here is spicy
isn't it? Hm?
Why? Aren't you feeling well?
Oh yes, I was thinking
of my husband.
How beautiful the children are.
I really think they are
very beautiful here.
Is your husband also fond of children?
Oh, I don't know. I think so.
But one never knows what he's thinking.
My brother died in Greece,
during the war.
He was buried there, so I
often come here to pray for him.
It consoles me a little.
I pray for something else, too. 
I want so much... I want so much to have a child.
- You understand me, don't you?
- Yes.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.
- See you later.
I see you took the car.
I didn't know you needed it.
Well you might have asked.
I didn't want to wake you up.
And I was in a hurry.
Why? What could possibly be so
urgent? Another ruin, immortalized by Charles?
I'm getting thoroughly sick of 
these love-
How can you make such a fuss,
just because I took the car?
It's not only that. 
Everything you do nowadays...
...seems so utterly senseless. 
You've become quite intolerable.
Alright, then. If that's the way you
feel, let's do something about it.
Alright. Let's get a divorce.
Good morning!
I've come to pick you up.
We should be leaving for Pompeii immediately.
Oh, well that's impossible. I, uh...
Oh, but you can't miss this.
It's a special occasion...
...something that's happened very
rarely since they've been excavating at Pompeii.
They're going to make a cast of the 
hollow place that has been left...
...in the lava by a human body!
I'm sorry, but we --
Oh, please, you must come.
Imagine that you actually
see the shape of a man...
...just as he was then, the moment
he was surprised by death.
It's an extraordinary experience.
Very few people ever get a chance to see it.
I must insist. I'm sure that you'll...
you'll thank me for it afterwards.
All these are new excavations.
It's on this spot that they
found a hollow space.
When the men find hollow ground...
...they make a number of holes, and
through these, they pour plaster.
The plaster fills out the hollow
space left in the ground by the body...
... which has disintegrated.
The shapes of bodies or objects...
... buried for over 2000 years
are reconstructed this way.
Look, you can begin to see something!
What is it?
Let's see.
It looks like a leg.
Yes. 
There's an arm.
There are two more legs.
It must be a group.
In the house of Menandro, they
found the remains of 9 people.
There's the head. 
You can see the skull with
the plaster clinging to it.
And now the skull bones and the
teeth, both remarkably well-preserved.
Two people, just as they were
at the moment they died.
A man and a woman.
A man and a woman.
Perhaps husband and wife.
Who knows?
May have found death like this together.
What's happened to Mrs. Joyce?
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
No, I'll talk to her.
Catherine! What's the matter?
What's happened to you?
Oh, Alex, this is too much.
I can't stand it anymore.
Please take me home. I want to go
home. I don't want to stay here any longer.
Well, if that's what you want, but...
We can't really leave these people like this.
They've been very kind, and this
isn't something they do every day.
We owe them some kind of explanation...
Well you explain to them.
Say I'm sick or something.
Alright.
Look, my life isn't feeling very well.
If you'll excuse us, I think I'll take her home.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Do you
want me to go with you? 
Do you know the way out or... or
would you like me to take you to somewhere...
...where she can rest?
Come, I'll show you.
No, no. I think it's much better
if I go myself.
She doesn't want anyone around just
at the moment, if you understand.
But, uh, she'll be alright, and we'll
probably be back in a few minutes.
Alright.
Is this the way out?
Yes, that's right.
You know, I understand how you feel.
I was pretty moved myself. But you
must try to pull yourself together.
Oh, did it affect you the same way?
I... I've seen so many
strange things today...
...that I didn't have the
time to tell you about.
There are many thing I didn't tell you.
I'm sorry I answered you in such a
stupid way when I came back this morning.
Why? Our situation is quite clear.
We've made our decision.
You don't have to make any excuses.
Don't you want to look around a little,
as long as we're here?
No.
Nothing here that brings
back old memories?
Oh, stop it! Must you continue
to... to harp on it?
I'm sick and tired of your sarcasm.
We have decided to get a divorce and that settles it.
Life is so short!
That's why one should make the most of it.
Look, I've been thinking.
Perhaps I ought to leave immediately.
You seem to like it here, so why don't
you stay on until you've sold the house?
I'll take the plane back to London.
I think the best thing to do...
...is to talk to a lawyer
and start proceedings.
Maybe what is wrong with our
marriage is that we... we didn't have a child.
Well you didn't want a child.
And now I agree with you.
You were quite right. You had
much more foresight than I did.
Imagine what it would be like
to have a child involved in this.
It would make the divorce
even more painful.
Painful? Is it going to be
painful for you?
Well... more complicated.
What in the world is going on?
Look at all these people.
Look at the children.
Ah, this is awful. We won't
get through for hours.
Alex, listen. Are you sure
we're doing the right thing?
Are you suddenly getting sentimental?
Listen, Cathy. We've been honest
with each other up 'til now.
Don't let's spoil everything.
How can they believe in that?
They're like a bunch of children.
Children are happy.
- Alex, I don't want you to hate me.
I don't want it to finish this way.
- Oh, Cathy.
What are you driving at? What game
are you trying to play?
You've never understood me.
You've never even tried.
And now this nonsense.
What is it you want?
Nothing. I despise you.
Well, come on. Let's get
out of this crowd.
A miracle! It was a miracle!
Alex! Alex!
- Alex, I don't want to lose you!
- Catherine.
Catherine, what's wrong with us?
Why do we torture one another?
When you say things that hurt me, I...
try to hurt you back, don't you see?
But I can't, I can't any longer...
...because I love you.
Perhaps we get hurt too easily.
Tell me that you love me.
Well, if I do, will you promise
not to take advantage of me?
Yes. But tell me. I want
to hear you say it.
Alright.
I love you.
