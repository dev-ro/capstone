TALES OF THE FOUR SEASONS
A WINTER'S TALE
You're taking a risk.
36, rue Victor Hugo.
That's easy to remember.
In Courbevoie, I forget the code.
Never mind, it's right near Paris.
I'll write to you when I arrive, OK?
Write to me, huh?
TOWN OF LEVALLOIS
FIVE YEARS LATER
Féllcie:
It's 8am.
AIready:
Morning.
Come to NicoIas's tonight?
I'm dining at Mum's.
And tomorrow I may go
to my sister's untll Monday.
OK, have a good day.
Thanks, you too.
Sure. Happens every day.
No, Iast night.
You're right.
I've really no cause for compIaint.
OK. Tuesday, then.
No, I thank you:
Who was it?
What's happened?
I've done it:
Done what? Jullette gone?
I'm going:
I'll drive. I'm expected at two o'cIock
for the inventory.
AIready? You didn't tell me:
I found out Iast night.
I couIdn't tell you on the phone.
Besides, I was sure
you were with whatsit.
I toId you it'd happen
before New Year's, and it did.
You'll come back when?
I won't be back. I'll stay down there.
I can't cIose the shop
over the holldays.
What about me?
Take the appointments here
today and tomorrow.
You must be here Tuesday
to receive the new manager.
Then... you join me soon as you can.
And my daughter?
There are schooIs there.
With the Christmas vacations,
you've time to enroI her.
Does Jullette know?
I toId her yesterday.
She wasn't too...
No. I thought she'd make a fuss,
but not at all,
she threw me out.
Good for her.
I preferred that.
I packed up and drove to a hoteI.
Suppose I don't come? You'll be aIone.
Why say that? You'll come.
I haven't said yes.
You wanted to Ieave Paris.
It's partIy for you I'm moving.
PartIy. A small part.
Don't put me on.
You doubt my Iove:
You doubt mine, so you don't trust me,
don't consuIt me.
We taIked for months:
OnIy vagueIy.
It wasn't vague to me.
It was to me:
You scared?
I haven't said yes,
but I haven't said no.
Since I have to make a decision...
I'll say... yes:
I'm surprised, too,
at how fast it's all happened.
I wish we couId Ieave together.
I can't go before Christmas:
there's Ellse, Mum, my sister...
I couId come down for a Iook Sunday.
Is it far?
A two-hour train ride.
You Ieave Saturday night
and return Monday afternoon.
Why didn't I think of that?
Now I've got to run.
You took your car. I hadn't seen.
Don't catch coId.
See you Saturday.
Watch out for ice:
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Am I too earIy?
- Not at all.
Give me your coat.
We shouId aIready be open,
but the other girI's Iate.
Here's Armelle.
- Shall I do highllghts?
- If you llke.
Maxence has gone to Nevers.
His new saIon. He starts Tuesday.
- And you?
- I'm staying, for now. Tell you Iater.
Maxence Ieaving?
But the saIon's not cIosing.
You staying?
No, I'm Ieaving.
- Hi, Mum.
- Hello, dear.
Ellse in bed?
Just went. Hurry, her llght's stllI on.
Give me a big kiss.
I have my big padaboom-boom-boom.
I've finished sIeeping.
How'd today go?
I pIayed with Anna.
We pIayed Daddy and Mummy,
yellow mouse,
pink mouse and green mouse,
I pIayed the mallman didn't come,
and the thief.
Fine. Now you go sound asIeep.
- Lie down.
- I want the llght out.
Go to sIeep
and we'll turn out the llght.
What?
To sIeep, Ellse.
What?
No tickllng.
Yes, tickIe:
Leave my rabbit or he'll hit you.
All right.
I Iove my bunny:
Go to sIeep, OK?
It's not Christmas yet,
but I got stuck in traffic.
Don't worry,
dinner wllI be ready in five minutes.
Not tonight.
Besides...
I've made a decision.
You know Maxence is moving to Nevers.
He Ieft today. I'm going to join him.
Right away?
I'm going Sunday to Iook it over
but I'll be back.
After Christmas,
Ellse and I go for good.
I thought you and Max had spllt up.
No, I waited untll he quit llving
with that woman.
To keep the steam up.
Why Iet him step on me?
Féllcie, don't taIk llke that:
He knows you're going?
I haven't toId him.
I onIy found out this morning.
It's a matter of how to break it.
He'll be shattered.
I don't think so.
He's aIways expected me to Ieave him,
that's nothing new.
In a way, I prefer him to Maxence.
If I stayed here,
I'd want him as a friend,
but he wouIdn't accept that.
He'd be right. Why not marry him?
You won't find a better man,
he's crazy about you.
Personally... I much prefer him
to your hairdresser.
You, maybe, but not me.
Mentally? What's wrong with him?
Nothing, but...
he's too much of an egghead.
That's OK in a friend,
but I feeI diminished.
I dunno... he's too sweet.
Sweet men are nice. They're rare.
Not as rare as you think.
With your character,
you disllke being dominated.
I do. I don't llke peopIe
I can bIow over.
I won't be dominated mentally,
but physically I llke it.
I llke strong men, not bookworms.
Some men are both.
I know.
But he Iearned it from llfe,
not from books.
Not Maxence.
Maxence...
he has taste,
he llkes beautifuI things.
He llkes IoveIy women
and I llke handsome men.
For me, a man's beauty lles
in his intelligence.
He's not as dumb as you think.
His intelligence is llke CharIes's,
but more rough hone.
Rough hewn.
Hewn. See? Maybe I'm no sharper
than he is.
- You didn't bring much.
- For two days...
You may stay on.
This the oId town?
No, the shopping district.
The saIon's on the corner.
Terrific Iocation.
It's darllng.
It's chic:
It's huge:
Like it?
It's fine. Room for at Ieast
five peopIe to work here.
For now, we're onIy three.
- We can decorate it Iater.
- I llke it. 1 900-styIe.
Nice sinks.
Infrareds, too.
It's really equipped.
That's not all. Come see the Iove nest.
I'll carry it.
Go on up.
I'm impressed.
I'll Iead the way.
It's roomy.
- Like it?
- A Iot. You've got furniture?
They Ieft some.
We can junk it if you want.
No, it's comfortabIe.
- Your books won't fllI the sheIves.
- We'll use knick-knacks.
There are the cIosets.
Handy.
This is the kitchen.
And here's the bedroom.
I know, it's not your styIe.
This is the room I'd paint first.
We'll dump the cherubs.
Aren't they cupids?
- No regrets?
- No.
Antique ceramics...from Nevers.
BeautifuI.
Those are cupids.
Really?
See the arrows? They're sons of Venus.
Isn't that the Venus by...
what's his name?
Botticelli.
ARCHAEOLOGICAL MUSEUM
Look at these twisted jars.
That's pretty.
Like perfume jars.
What's a rellquary?
It's the gIass coffin
that's used to exhibit her.
She has a straight nose:
''Street of pretty mittens''...
In the street of pretty mittens...
There are pretty llttIe kittens...
But no stray cats:
I've got my llttIe kitten.
And me my big tomcat.
I Iove you.
In the street of pretty mittens...
BREAKNECK STREET
BeautifuI walls.
I Iove them.
Up we go:
- Don't run.
- I'm not.
I'm worn out.
Come on:
LoveIy. The Loire River?
Before the bridge was bullt,
a patroI heIped pllgrims across.
They waIked across?
Sure.
What's that tower?
Part of the oId walls. Shall we go see?
What's weird is he never gave you
his address.
He was offered severaI restaurants,
and had to go inspect them.
He must've llved somewhere.
I don't know.
He didn't say where he was going?
Yes, but I forgot.
It's not a famlliar name.
I just know it's in America.
North?
I assume so.
Maybe it was South America.
No, it was the United States.
North or South, I didn't care,
I'd have followed him anywhere.
I never thought
I couId Iouse up my address.
How dumb can you be?
You didn't know where you llved?
Yes, but I said one word
instead of another, as I often do.
What's that called?
- A sllp of the tongue.
- That's it, a sllp.
I meant Levallois,
and I said Courbevoie.
Why? It just happened.
Think so?
I noticed it six months Iater.
I made the same sllp
on the maternity-cllnic forms.
That's when I knew
I gave him a bum address.
Before that,
you thought he'd forgotten you?
No, I thought he was dead.
Never thought of getting rid
of the chlld?
It never occurred to me.
It's against my convictions.
Not rellgious convictions...
Rellgion and I don't get aIong,
But convictions that are...
PersonaI...
Intimate, I'd say.
That's it, intimate.
I disllke what's contrary to nature.
I'd Iost CharIes, but...
I had his chlld.
A chlld and some photos.
He had neither.
I bet he thought you'd dumped him.
No.
He must have,
if you gave him a faIse address.
I know what he thought:
It's an assumption,
but as good as yours:
What'd he think?
When I reallsed my sllp,
I was pregnant but stllI working.
When my Levallois house
was condemned, I moved to Mum's.
I went to the post office
in Courbevoie.
They were nice enough,
but knew nothing.
They keep no records.
If there's no return address,
they throw it out.
And generaI dellvery?
I tried it, thanks. Nothing.
I noticed there was aIso
a Victor Hugo Street in Courbevoie.
I went there,
in case someone found a Ietter.
And guess what:
I dunno. There was no such number?
There had been a No.36,
but it was being demollshed, too.
I figured if CharIes
had Iooked for me...
and I'm certain he did...
he'd think it wasn't my fauIt
that his Ietter was returned:
That's assuming a Iot.
It's perfectIy IogicaI.
Anyway, it gave me courage.
He wrote to Iots of organisations,
but I had a major handicap:
I didn't know his name.
His Iast name?
At the restaurant he was CharIes.
He was moonllghting, so no pay sllp.
He had a Danish or Dutch name,
with an ''en'' in it
or an ''er''... den, den, der...
He knew your name.
So what?
I aIways llve with someone.
Mum uses her maiden name,
my sisters married.
I'm the girI no one can find.
Poor kid. You were really out of Iuck.
I was dumb:
Stark, raving dumb:
Stark, raving mad.
We don't say ''stark, raving dumb''.
See, I'm inarticuIate.
It can happen to anyone.
All that's over,
I don't want to dwell on it.
Forget it.
I want to think onIy of you.
I want to Iove onIy you.
You want to Iove me?
Don't ask too much of me now.
I Iove you,
but I want to Iove you more.
A llttIe more.
A llttIe?
Yes, it won't take much,
but it can't just come, right away.
ReIy on me. I'm patient. I can wait.
I understand, I won't push.
Trust me?
Yes, or I wouIdn't be here.
It's me:
Mummy's here.
FIowers.
Pretty, is that for me?
- It's for Mummy.
- For everyone.
That, that and that, for everyone.
That's a princess.
It's a doll with a crown on her head.
I see the crown.
Your mind stllI made up?
More than ever. It's nice there.
Ellse wllI llke it.
When do you Ieave?
Right after Christmas.
I have to stay to hand things over.
I'll be swamped in work.
I'm not partisan.
He sure doesn't favour women.
''You're morally unfit
for marriage,'' he says.
Men and women are the same.
- OK, but he...
- They're equaI...
Not all of them,
he stllI protects Rickie,
says he's ''physically unfit for marriage''.
Because he llmps... And he says,
''Women assert nature's rights,
''but nature's not worth a hoot,
or maybe just a whimper.''
We're having a discussion.
Féllcie, meet Quentin.
Have you read The Longest Journey?
I read it so Iong ago
I've forgotten it.
You haven't,
we were just taIking about it.
Their discussion
about the cow and reallty.
When he strikes a match,
they're in the room in Cambridge,
and a character mentions a cow...
That's phllosophy...
There's more in the book than that.
It's important
to expIore the existence of reallty.
- So you saw that?
- He says so in Chapter 1 .
But how do you see Rickie,
who wllI experience reallty?
Rickie appears gradually in the story,
first against the phllosophicaI taIe
at the start...
So you think he's the...
The key character.
Not to me.
Leave it, Féllcie,
I'll take care of it.
You OK?
I'm fine.
Can we heIp?
No, thanks, Edwige. Dinner's ready.
We've all llved
an incaIcuIabIe number of llves.
Think so?
I'm certain.
You're at Ieast in your 500th llfe.
500's impossibIe.
How do you know?
You're not just some mineraI growth,
you didn't reach your spirituaI IeveI
in onIy a few years,
three or four llves.
But I did:
Cats have nine llves...
It's a maximum for us.
If one can belleve such things...
Edwige aIways goes overboard.
who rejects the supernaturaI.
That's not supernaturaI,
it's superstition.
It's not superstition.
There's no difference between
your supernaturaI and mine.
You make one, but backwards.
You buy the supernaturaI in everything
but Christianity, and get suckered.
By whom?
CharIatans.
No charIatan has suckered me.
I don't beIong to a sect.
I have no guru.
I don't give away money.
I buy books, but onIy in a saIe.
You're hooked by the charIatanism
of the Church.
You accept the miracIe of Lourdes
but reject my ideas.
My faith doesn't rest on miracIes.
I may not be a perfect Cathollc,
but they turn me off.
- Yet you're a bellever?
- Of course.
Without the supernaturaI,
there's no rellgion.
Your supernaturaI isn't reaI.
What's reaI supernaturallsm?
Yours is magic, not rellgion.
Magic? All rellgions have belleved
in reincarnation.
It's compatibIe with Christianity.
- I say it isn't.
- Why not?
It's not a moraI idea.
It ellminates responsibllity.
You can onIy be responsibIe
for one llfe.
You'll never shed your morallsm.
Why shouId I?
I disagree.
If a spirit llves in many bodies,
it gradually grows perfect.
Responsibllity is preserved.
That sounds fine,
but to me it's meaningIess.
I know, I'm ignorant.
He's the ignorant one:
He can't see
beyond the GospeIs.
All great minds have belleved
in metempsychosis,
meaning reincarnation.
IncIuding poets. Victor Hugo:
''So a beast comes and goes,
''Roars, screams, bites.
''A tree is there,
its branches bristllng,
''A paving stone collapses
''In the road that carts crush
and winter ruins.
''Under those thicknesses of matter
''and of night, tree, beast, stone,
weight that nothing raises,
''In that terribIe depth,
''A souI dreams.
''What does it do?
It dreams of God.''
Well done:
When wllI we meet again?
After the holldays.
If you llke. Well, good karma:
Happy Karmic Year.
- Your purse.
- My purse:
Happy New Year.
And to you.
Karmic or not.
It wllI be.
Take care, Féllcie.
Have fun, you two.
You didn't expect a crowd.
Were you bored?
I tried to tell you on the phone,
but you hung up.
Sorry, I had a customer.
I'd have come anyway.
I had something important to say.
Very important.
What?
Something that couIdn't wait.
So spit it out.
I've reached a decision.
What decision?
Wait, making a decision
is not aIways easy.
There are pros and cons.
Then you decide because you must.
Come on, tell me:
I'm Ieaving with Maxence.
For his hick town?
He has his beauty saIon.
It's no hick town.
Nevers is big. Know it?
Yeah, you toId me, it's his home town.
He's dumped that woman?
I hope so.
You hope:
An expression.
You know it ended Iong ago.
And Ellse?
She'll go with us.
When do you Ieave?
Me, in a week. He's aIready gone.
So soon?
And you're onIy telling me now?
You act first and tell me Iater.
You needn't have toId me.
Why'd you bother to come?
He toId me about it Friday morning
and Ieft at once.
I went there Saturday to visit him,
and got back Iast night.
I guessed from your message
something was up.
You're not a good llar.
I didn't lle. I said
I wasn't sure I was free.
Not for the same reasons.
Anyway, you've known for five days:
I couIdn't say it on the phone.
I wanted to break it to you gentIy,
now I've had to spring it
on you at bedtime.
Sorry, I Ioused it up.
I'd llke us to spllt up peacefully,
since we'll remain friends...
even if we see llttIe of each other.
You're opposed, it hurts me
to Ieave you, too, but I must.
You don't have to llve
with a man you don't Iove:
I Iove Maxence:
I aIways toId you I did.
That's why I insisted he Ieave that girI,
since he said it was over.
You never toId me.
I'm telling you now:
That's new.
You said you Ioved onIy
your daughter's father.
There's Iove and Iove.
I Ioved CharIes, stllI do, totally.
I Iove Maxence another way.
I Iove you, too.
It's not reaI Iove.
It's not reaI with Maxence, either:
Making Iove with him
doesn't mean I Iove him.
I don't know if you see.
I Iove him as a man I can llve with
even if I'd rather llve
with someone eIse who's absent.
Many women wouId rather
llve with some other man,
but he's not reaI, he's a dream.
For me, the dream was reallty.
An absent reallty.
Listen, perhaps I'm going
because of CharIes,
so that he'll be just a dream,
maybe that's better.
I thought I saw CharIes
in the street Friday.
You thought?
I'm sure it wasn't him,
but I have visions.
There's a tiny chance I might find him
in Paris: it obsesses me.
In Nevers, there's no hope,
so my mind's free.
Who knows, he might go there,
just llke you?
Don't put ideas in my head.
I can get a job in the sticks, too.
You mustn't sacrifice yourseIf for me.
It's no sacrifice if I'm with you.
Nothing eIse matters.
You need a woman who Ioves you
as you Iove her.
I'll never Iove you enough.
You know that.
Go with your Maxence,
he Ioves you and you Iove him:
I sincereIy wish you happiness.
Stop it: I hate sympathy:
If we're breaking up, Iet's do it fast,
I was getting my hopes up.
Better a cIean break.
I'm sad, maybe sadder than you.
Sure:
I'll miss you as a friend.
I can't repIace you.
But you won't miss me Iong
as a woman, I hope.
If I'm here, you won't meet
the Iove of your llfe. She exists.
You're Iucky I'm Ieaving.
I'm not kidding.
I mean it from the bottom of my heart.
I belleve you mean it
from the bottom of your heart.
Because you're beautifuI,
but that's not enough.
Why?
Because I feeI I can read your heart.
One can rareIy read peopIe's hearts.
Sometimes I lle.
Not about important things.
I won't find that in another woman.
Don't say that.
Why?
It'll keep you
from Ioving someone eIse.
Then you'll be to me
what CharIes is to you.
Don't joke about CharIes.
That's different.
You don't Iove me
as much as I did him,
and I don't Iove you a tenth
as much as he did me.
I don't want to go home.
Can I sIeep upstairs?
I'll go up, it's unheated.
You stay here.
No, I'm going up.
Don't fuss, I'm warm-bIooded.
As you wish.
No kiss?
SIeep well.
I'll try.
Féllcie'll be away for January 1 ?
- Here's the YuIe Iog...
- There's a squirreI.
Want the squirreI?
And the Christmas tree.
There's a Santa CIaus.
You want a Santa CIaus, too?
I know he's here.
There he is:
This interest you?
No, but I'll give it to Coralle.
Taking that with you?
Yes, why not?
Your boyfriend might not llke it.
Too bad. It's none of his business.
Ellse has a right
to her father's photo in her room.
Maybe, I dunno.
What?
ShouId you tell her so much
about her father,
now that she's getting
a foster father?
She knows he's not her reaI dad.
I'm Iucky to have the picture,
so why hide it?
A chlld shouId know
what her dad's llke.
But he's disappeared.
He couId reappear, maybe after I die.
You can't count on that, as you know.
You give her faIse hopes.
It's frustrating for a kid.
Hope's better than nothing.
Then she can tell the kids in schooI,
''I have a daddy, too, he's away,
but he's handsome...''
At her age,
she can't tell if a man's handsome.
She tell you that?
I toId her, and she belleves me.
You're overdoing it.
She belleves me because she knows.
A matter of taste.
I Iove nothing about him,
the whoIe or the parts.
I don't Iove his nose,
his eyes or his mouth.
Your nose is rather llke his.
Yes, and I've aIways hated my nose.
Yours is straighter.
I have proof...
No, a sign that I don't Iove him.
I wouIdn't want chlldren with him,
but I couId with Maxence.
I don't know, we'll see.
- What is it?
- Nothing, I just said, ''Ah.''
Anyway, I've hardIy seen
your hairdresser.
To you he's beefy.
But I don't llke skinny men.
I llke 'em well-padded.
I can't say he's bad, he's just too...
Too handsome?
Too pretty boy.
What's wrong with that?
He's too reguIar.
I llke cIassic beauty.
Don't forget I'm a beautician.
Beauty's my business.
He's too llke a maIe modeI.
Say it, llke an aftershave ad:
I didn't mean that.
More llke the sallor of my dreams.
He's no sallor, he's a cook.
In a grand hoteI.
No, in good llttIe restaurants.
My Prince Charming is a cook.
If I'd saved enough money
I couId check
every restaurant in America.
No chance of that now?
Now I've made my choice.
Good or bad,
I don't know, but I had to choose.
You don't know?
If you know, then it's not a choice.
There's aIways a risk.
Therefore, go sIow.
You decided in a fIash.
You llke it there?
Yeah... I couIdn't really judge,
it was Sunday.
But Nevers is a big, llveIy city.
You can stllI change your mind,
you're not gone yet.
Why wouId I change my mind?
You don't seem very fired up.
About the city?
The city or the guy.
A guy fired me up once. That's enough.
That's your imagination.
and I'll be happy with Maxence.
Life wllI be peacefuI with him.
I really need that.
Nevers is 1 49 mlles from Paris,
I can visit you.
You can visit us.
We'll tour the area.
He's not here, we'll take a cab.
Wait.
With you in a minute.
Had a good trip?
You all right, Ellse?
Give Maxence a kiss.
We'll put that there.
Let's go up.
Sorry, I'm busy
for another 1 5 minutes.
I couId've come, but...
Forgive me?
Doesn't matter. Come upstairs, Ellse.
This is Maxence's and Mummy's room.
I'll show you yours.
See your big bed?
Like it?
What's the matter?
Mind llving over a beauty saIon?
No, we have our apartment.
It'll be nice and quiet...
I'd have carved the chicken.
No probIem. It's easy.
You OK?
I just didn't expect company.
I couId've heIped you.
Leave it: Take that in.
Thanks, Madam.
Call me Féllcie.
No, call her Madam, she's the boss.
I've an appointment.
Michelle, I'm going up.
I'll be back.
You OK?
What's wrong?
Why's there no garden?
It's on the terrace.
That's not a garden.
It's not llke Grandma's.
Why?
That's how it is.
There's a garden over there...
You saw it when we got here.
Sharp girI. It's too coId now.
I have my coat.
I can't take you. I have to stay.
- Why?
- I've work to do.
Oh, it's a sIow morning...
Put your coat on, we're going out.
Make up your mind.
We're going out for a bit.
Don't be Iong. We'll get busy Iater.
Fetch the ball.
Go on:
We're going home now.
Come on, Ellse.
It's a church?
It's a cathedraI.
Let's go.
Now what?
I want to see the Nativity.
What's the matter?
I want to see the church.
We haven't time now.
We do:
OK, just for a moment.
See llttIe Jesus.
Recognise him?
Come aIong now.
I want to stay:
You can Iook, but don't touch.
You have customers waiting:
Sorry, Ellse needed air.
You said a coupIe of minutes,
that was two hours ago:
You called me the boss.
I'll do my part.
Go up to your room.
This your coat?
The chlld's hungry,
I'm going up for a whlle.
All right.
- Happy holldays.
- Thanks, you too.
The llttIe man was very nice,
and the witch's famlly was wicked...
Lunch.
Why was it wicked?
It was mad at the llttIe boy.
Féllcie, you hear me?
I'm in the kitchen.
It was mad at him
and so it was mad
at the bear and the llttIe boy.
Why was it mad?
'Cause the llttIe bear
and the llttIe boy...
heIped all peopIe with probIems.
What's up?
I've been thinking.
We need to get organised.
You can't tend to Ellse
and work during the holldays.
We shouId hire a temp,
or a nursemaid.
How about it?
You decide.
It's beside the point.
So what's the point?
Eat:
Come on.
Sorry. I didn't mean to offend you
calling you the boss.
It's a matter of organisation.
I'm going back home.
What?
I've decided to return to Paris.
Why?
What have you suddenIy got against me?
Nothing speciaI. Nothing's changed.
I Iove you as I did before,
no more, no Iess.
Well, then?
Not enough to llve with you.
How much is ''enough''?
Enough: I can onIy llve with a man
I'm madIy in Iove with.
I'm not crazy about you.
This is insane:
It's mad to be mad
about someone.
But I'm mad.
You have to take me as I am.
You can't devote your llfe
to a nut:
You're not crazy.
My fIash decision
to come was mad.
You decided in a fIash to Ieave:
That's different.
I don't see why.
It is...
My first decision
was made just to decide,
I wasn't seeing cIearIy.
You see cIearIy now?
Very.
I've never seen so cIearIy before.
SuddenIy things became very cIear.
What's cIear?
What I said: I can't llve with a man
I'm not mad about:
To you, that's just words,
but not to me.
Seeing doesn't mean I understand.
But that's how it is:
What is all this?
I don't get it at all.
You can't understand.
I'm the one who saw, not you.
- Let me go:
- Listen:
Let go, it hurts:
Tough:
I rareIy Iose my temper,
but when I do, watch out:
It's Iousy, with things going so well.
You're tired.
I'll hire a temp for a week,
Ionger if you llke.
Forget the saIon.
You'll have time to fix this pIace up.
I'm going back to Paris:
Let go or I'll sIug you:
Sorry, but it's physicaI.
I won't be heId by force,
especially today.
I'm Ieaving anyway,
so Iet's part friends.
I can't Iove you in these conditions.
Conditions can change.
I mean they're so finaI.
Don't come near me:
Grant me one thing.
You can do as you pIease,
but wait a bit.
Give me that token of trust.
I won't taIk to you of friendship,
much Iess Iove.
No, it wouId be pointIess.
I'm ashamed to do this to you.
It puts you in an awkward spot.
Questions wllI be asked.
- Well?
- You covet respectabllity.
So don't Ieave.
The faster I go,
the fewer questions there'll be.
Don't worry about me.
I'll tell the truth.
That you're depressed,
but you'll be better soon.
Anyway, you're tired.
What're you doing for Iunch?
Come on, I'll take you out.
Not across the street, it's noisy.
We'll go to the fancy pIace.
Don't touch me again, Max.
All right. I'm going out.
I need some air, too.
You can't say I get in your way.
See you at the restaurant.
Finished?
No chicken?
I'm full.
OK, eat your fromage frais and we're off.
We're going to Grandma's.
We're not staying?
No, we'll take the train.
Why?
Like that. Basically,
you're pIeased, no?
What's basically mean?
Down deep. I know you understand.
What's going on?
Hi, Mum.
Nothing wrong. I changed my mind.
Did you quarreI?
No. He was sweet,
didn't try to stop me.
I feIt gullty:
he introduced me as his wife.
It dented his respectabllity,
but he doesn't care a damn.
How do you know?
He said so.
- Put your coat away.
- The llghts aren't bllnking.
Go on. Come back Iater.
He doesn't care a damn for you,
either?
No, he understands.
Understands what?
Don't llve with a woman
who doesn't Iove you.
You toId me you Ioved him.
Not enough to llve with him.
OK, why shouId I defend him?
I aIways thought you chose wrong.
There are no good or bad choices.
Choice shouIdn't come into it.
You'll have to choose someday.
OK, I chose. That's past now,
Iet's forget it.
I want my mind cIear.
I'll find a two-room apartment
for Ellse and me.
A job's no probIem:
the Saint-CIair saIon wanted me.
At Ieast I hope they stllI do.
And Loïc?
Oh, Loïc...
That's not bad.
Féllcie:
Haven't you Ieft yet?
- Yes, now I'm back.
- Back?
Am I in the way?
Come into my office.
And Maxence?
He stayed. I Ieft him.
That so?
Sit down.
It's weird, we didn't even quarreI.
He said something that hurt me.
It was the Iast straw.
What happened before that?
Nothing... a feellng.
It was coming apart.
What was?
Everything. The first time
I went to Nevers, it all worked:
the town, the house, the peopIe.
The second time it was Iousy.
First I saw the pIuses,
then the minuses.
Yes, absoIuteIy...
Thanks for calling.
He didn't just Iet you go:
He did.
I thought we'd argue for hours.
I saw it coming: take your time,
think it over,
there's no rush.
He said it all,
then turned and went out to eat.
I see.
You didn't hoId me back, either.
I couIdn't hoId you by force.
And arguing with you is useIess.
You usually argue.
With me you argued Iess than usuaI.
I thought that
because things were really serious,
I couId onIy hoId you
by Ietting you go.
It didn't work.
You came back.
But not to you.
Well, maybe a llttIe.
What do you want men to do?
Use force? GroveI at your feet?
Threaten suicide?
You know I don't.
I'm dellghted
you were both so sweet to me,
but I stllI think it's weird.
Why weird?
Because it is. You start out yelling,
then suddenIy stop.
That's normaI. We controI ourseIves.
With me it was too easy.
When peopIe don't resist, I feeI...
Confused?
That's right. I drift.
It's an odd feellng.
It figures,
if you keep changing your mind.
What wllI you do now?
You Iost your job.
I found another...
I'll get the answer today.
The pay's better than at Maxence's.
I can rent a small pIace
for me and Ellse.
- Where?
- I'll find one.
Move in with me.
We can fix up the room upstairs.
I didn't Ieave Maxence
to go back to you:
I'm just suggesting
a friendIy arrangement.
That's sweet. But you don't mean it.
I do mean it,
but I thought you'd say no.
Then why'd you ask me?
Maybe I couId persuade you.
I'm not starting again.
If I ever llve in a man's home,
it won't be yours.
Don't Iook so sad. You know why?
I Iove you. Not enough to llve
with you, onIy to ruin your llfe.
You're not:
Don't start again:
At Ieast my Ieaving cIarified things.
Now we can be reaI friends.
You don't want to?
OK.
OK for reaI?
OK for reaI.
I feeI llke being with you. Got pIans?
I'm going to the theatre.
AIone?
Yes. If we get there earIy,
we can get you a ticket.
I don't know if you'll llke it.
- What's on?
- Shakespeare.
I know Romeo and Juliet?
What's it about?
I've read the pIay.
It's pretty far-fetched.
Compllcated?
No. But Iots of...
Lots of fantastic things happen.
PeopIe who were thought dead,
exlles,
who reappear resurrected.
I can't tell you the pIot.
OK. If it's llke Romeo.
I'll llke it.
See you Iater.
See you tonight.
''O Paullna,
we honour you with troubIe.
''But we came to see
the statue of our queen:
''Your gallery
have we passed through,
''not without much content
in many singuIarities.
''But we saw not
''that which my daughter
came to Iook upon:
''the statue of her mother.
''As she llved peerIess,
''so her dead llkeness exceIs
''whatever yet you Iooked upon,
''or hand of man hath done.
''Therefore I keep it IoneIy, apart.
''But here it is:
''prepare to see the llfe
as llveIy mocked
''as ever stllI sIeep mocked death.
''BehoId...
''And say 'tis well.
''I llke your sllence:
it the more shows off your wonder.
''But yet speak:
''First you, my llege.
Comes it not something near?
''Her naturaI posture:
''Chide me, dear stone,
''that I may say indeed
thou art Hermione.
''Or, rather, thou art she
''in thy not chiding, for she was
''as tender as infancy and grace...
''There's magic in thy majesty,
''which has my evlls
conjured to remembrance,
''and from thy admiring daughter
took the spirits
''standing llke stone with thee.
''Give me Ieave,
and do not say 'tis superstition,
''that I kneeI and then
impIore her bIessing.
''Lady, dear queen,
''that ended when I but began,
give me that hand of yours to kiss.
''O, patience: The statue is but
new fixed, the coIour's not dry...
''Do not draw the curtain:
''No Ionger shall you gaze on't Iest
your fancy may think anon it moves.
''Let be: WouId I were dead,
but that methinks aIready...
''See, my Iord,
wouId you not deem it breathed
''and that those veins
did verlly bear bIood?
''MasterIy done: The very llfe
seems warm upon her llp.
''The fixture of her eye
has motion in't
''as we are mocked with art.
''I'll draw the curtain.
My Iord's aImost so far transported...
''Let't aIone...
''StllI methinks
''There is an air comes from her.
''What fine chiseI
couId ever yet cut breath?
''Let no man mock me,
for I wllI kiss her.
''My Iord, forbear.
''The ruddiness upon her llp is wet:
you'll mar it if you kiss it,
''Stain your own
with olly painting...
''Either forbear,
quit presentIy the chapeI,
''Or resoIve you for more amazement.
''If you can behoId it,
I'll make the statue move...
''Descend, and take you
by the hand...
''It is required
you do awake your faith.
''Then all stand stllI.
''Those who think it unIawfuI
business... Iet them depart.
''Proceed. No foot shall stir.
''Music, awake her.
''Strike:
'''Tis time:
''Descend, be stone no more...
''Strike all that Iook upon
with marveI. Come,
''I'll fllI your grave up.
Come away...
''Bequeath to death your numbness,
''For from him
dear llfe redeems you...
''Start not:
''her actions shall be hoIy
as you hear my spell is IawfuI.
''Do not shun her...
for then you kllI her doubIe.
''Nay, present your hand.
''When she was young
you wooed her.
''Now, in age, is she become the suitor?
''O, she's warm:
''If this be magic,
Iet it be an art IawfuI as eating.
''She embraces him.
''She hangs about his neck.
''If she pertain to llfe,
Iet her speak too.
''Ay, and make it manifest
where she has llved,
''or how stoI'n from the dead.
''That she is llving, were it but toId you,
shouId be hooted at...
''But it appears she llves,
though yet she speak not.
''Mark a llttIe whlle.
''Interpose, fair madam: kneeI
and pray your mother's bIessing.
''Turn, good Iady,
our Perdita is found.
''You gods:
''Look down and from
your sacred viaIs pour
''your graces upon my daughter's head:
''Tell me, mine own,
''where hast thou been preserved?
Where llved?
''How found thy father's court?
''Thou shaIt hear that I,
''knowing the oracIe gave hope
thou wast in being,
''have preserved myseIf
to see the issue.''
Want a drink?
I don't know.
Shall I take you home?
Let's go to your pIace,
I'll take a cab home.
Too expensive. I'll take you.
I'll take a cab:
We'll see.
I'm surprised it upset you so.
I react llke a llttIe girI.
When the statue moved
I aImost screamed.
I aImost screamed,
you squeezed my hand so hard.
I didn't reallse.
The pIay's not pIausibIe.
I don't llke what's pIausibIe.
One ambiguity bothers me.
Does magic bring the statue to llfe,
or hadn't she ever died?
You don't get it.
Faith brings her to llfe.
I'm more rellgious than you.
From some viewpoints.
Even from yours. I'll tell you
something that'll startIe you.
Yesterday I prayed in church.
- Where?
- In Nevers.
I had sort of a row with Maxence.
Something he said hurt me.
I went out to get it off my mind.
We passed the cathedraI,
Ellse wanted to see the Nativity.
Mum tells her about God,
and sets up a Nativity at home.
So we went in.
Whlle she Iooked, I sat on a chair.
And prayed?
Yes... but not llke
I was taught as a kid.
In my own way.
It's more refIection than prayer.
Meditation.
That's it.
When you have something on your mind,
when you've sIept badIy
and face a decision,
a kind of excitement in the brain
makes you think faster.
That's what I feIt,
but a hundred times stronger.
SuddenIy, everything was cIear,
it was...
Dazzllng?
I wasn't dazzIed,
I saw everything cIearIy.
What did you see?
It's hard to say.
I didn't think, I saw my thoughts.
All my reasoning on whether
to Ieave or not came in a fIash.
And I saw it,
I saw what I had to do,
and saw I was right.
You mean return to Paris?
Before, I'd tried to choose,
then I saw there was no choice.
I didn't have to choose
something I didn't want.
See? I know it sounds trite,
but suddenIy it seemed obvious.
It's hard to expIain.
I understand.
I've had Iucid moments,
aIthough not that cIear.
PeopIe who convert
sometimes have these llIuminations
in church, llke you.
But I didn't convert.
You belleved aIready.
If I were God,
I'd cherish you particuIarIy.
Why?
Because you were unjustIy unhappy,
and you can sacrifice
your happiness, your llfe
to a Iove that's out of reach.
Then God shouId
give me back CharIes.
Whoa:
That may not be
the right request.
I'm not asking him for anything.
I didn't think of God,
though I do sometimes.
In that second that was
so full of things, I saw
I was aIone in the worId:
it was up to me to act,
and not be pushed around
by anyone or anything.
That won't heIp you find CharIes.
I won't do things
that keep me from finding him.
Besides...
I thought of something eIse
in that second...
Maybe you're right:
finding him's unllkeIy,
he may be married,
or doesn't Iove me.
But that's no reason
for me to give up.
If even you admit
your chances are nearIy nll,
why ruin your llfe for...?
Because if I find him, it'll be so...
a joy so great
I'll gIadIy give my llfe for it.
And I'm not ruining it:
not everyone llves with hope.
You mean that?
I belleve it,
even if it sounds stupid.
It's not stupid.
Someone very bright said it earller.
AImost word for word.
I doubt if you've read it.
Shakespeare?
No, PascaI.
- A phllosopher?
- In a way.
He calls it the wager:
if you bet on immortallty,
the stake is so huge
it makes up for the Iong odds.
Even if the souI isn't immortaI,
belleving it is
Iets you llve better.
I belleve the souI's immortaI,
more than you do.
You belleve in it onIy after death,
I say it exists
before birth.
Maybe Edwige soId you on it,
but not me.
I don't need her to belleve in it.
To me it's obvious.
If the souI llves on afterward,
why didn't it llve before?
What's a souI with no identity?
Who are you
if your previous llfe's a bIank?
I'm aware of mine. It exists.
It's dim, but it exists.
You are, too,
but you don't reallse it.
Why am I certain I Iove CharIes?
How can I be absoIuteIy sure?
When I met him,
I feIt I'd been through it before.
How do you expIain it
unIess we'd met in a former llfe?
Stop, you're kllllng me.
It's not crap:
It's instinctive science:
But it's not PascaI this time.
Victor Hugo?
PIato.
He's all we needed.
He belleved in reincarnation, too.
Yes and no. But that's another story.
The point is he reasoned just llke you
to prove the souI's immortaI.
It's called reasoning
by ''recollection''.
You don't agree?
I don't share the Greeks' rellgion.
PIato may not have, either.
''Cebes added: Your doctrine,
that knowIedge is simpIy recollection,
''if true, aIso implles a previous time
''in which we have Iearned
that which we now recollect.
''This wouId be impossibIe
unIess our souI...''
- CarefuI, it's hot.
- Thanks.
''..had been
''in some pIace before existing
in the form of man.''
That quote was on my college finaIs.
I haven't forgotten it.
But I see
PIato's reincarnation doctrine
as what's called a myth.
Yeah, mythoIogy.
No...
It means he didn't really belleve it
as objective truth.
It was a convenient notion
for his time, which doesn't prove
the souI is immortaI as a substance,
but affirms the presence
in our ''Iearning''
of something anterior to experience.
That's why it's so modern.
I'm boring you.
No, you amuse me.
You've taught me a Iot.
I feeI much Iess ignorant.
You gave me a yen to read.
But I don't have your mentallty.
What mentallty?
You can't do without books.
If I say I Iove you, you'll check
to see if that's in a book.
To you, onIy what's written is true.
It's a guIf between us.
It doesn't bother me.
It does me.
You said you're gIad
you Iearned so much from me.
Yes, but I'll never be an egghead.
I don't want to be one.
I want to be me.
In the cathedraI yesterday,
I feIt entireIy myseIf.
Five years ago, I feIt llke me, too.
With you,
I feeI good, but different.
Maybe we knew each other
in a former llfe, too.
Yes. You'd have been
my brother, maybe, not my Iover.
There must've been some affection.
Maybe I was your dog or cat,
or you were mine.
I don't want to go home.
I'd llke to sIeep with you,
but I'll go right to sIeep.
All right.
Wait, Ellse, don't run:
Wait for me, we'll get the tickets.
Look at its llttIe tall.
Look at the llon in the cage...
Nice work.
I toId you so.
Now I've seen it for myseIf.
Wait for us:
Why... I can't go through.
HeIp her through.
We'll take the metro.
You can go straight home.
Come to my house.
You can phone your mother.
We're going to Loïc's.
Look at my beautifuI castIe.
It is beautifuI.
They destroyed everything.
I'd llke to llve in a castIe llke that.
Maybe you can someday.
No, never.
Why not?
I don't know.
It's OK, a bit cramped,
but... she sIept better than I did.
I think we're staying here today.
She was tired, and so am I.
We'll go for a drive with Loïc.
Take care, Mum. I'll put her on.
Ellse, come here.
How are you, Grandma?
I'm fine.
I sIept with Mummy in a big bed.
I knew there was a Sunday market.
It's great. Come here often?
Not in 1 0 years.
Hasn't changed much.
Behind those trees
is a pretty llttIe church.
The church:
Yes, behind the trees.
Today's Sunday. The church.
You mean I ought to go to mass.
No, I'm with you.
UnIess you want to go, too.
CertainIy not.
You went the other day.
On a weekday. You're Cathollc.
You shouId go to mass.
Maybe. If I was aIone.
But I won't bother you with that.
It's no bother. Don't sacrifice
your convictions for me.
You come too.
I won't sacrifice
my convictions for you, either.
My convictions...
You know how to pray. Pray for me.
What'll you do, meanwhlle?
The shopping. And we'll go to the park.
I'll go some other day.
No: Today: And you'll pray for me.
I aIways pray for you.
This time really do it for me.
I mean, as if you were me.
What'll I ask for?
What I'd ask for.
Even if you don't agree.
I'm very demanding.
I do pray for your happiness,
even if it's not mine.
Do it from the bottom of your heart.
I'll try.
What do you mean, you'll try?
You do ask a Iot of me.
See you Iater.
We going shopping?
I don't have to go away tomorrow.
I saw the famlly at Christmas.
For us, Christmas is what counts,
not New Year's.
If you stay, what'll you do?
Whatever you say.
FeeI llke spending a day at the shore?
I'm tied up.
We're having a party at home.
At Christmas I was about to Ieave,
one sister was away...
Now they're all coming.
What if you'd stayed in Nevers?
I'd have come up with Maxence.
You can come, you know.
As your fiancé?
Of course they'd think that.
It'd dellght them at home.
I can't see myseIf
at your foIks' pIace.
Why not? Come.
You kidding:
I'm not. My brother and sister
are coming, with their famllies.
I Iook sllIy there by myseIf.
I'm not your wife: What wouId
your parents say? They're so Cathollc.
Yes, but broad-minded.
If I introduced you,
they'd think I want to marry you.
They want their son marrying
an unwed mother?
These days...
I'm neither widowed nor divorced.
CharIes might appear at any moment.
At any moment: No one belleves that:
You said you didn't either any more.
Any sensibIe woman is more llkeIy
be seduced by a stranger,
than you are of meeting Ellse's father,
even assuming he stllI Ioves you.
That's how everyone figures it.
They're wrong:
They onIy see things from outside.
CharIes reappearing
is not what matters.
He remains in my heart,
so I can't give it to anyone eIse.
You say you're inarticuIate,
but sometimes
you say things beautifully.
Because my feellngs are speaking.
We'll go up.
Good night.
Give Loïc a kiss.
- Coming back down?
- Why?
It's earIy.
You won't sIeep right away.
There are Iots of books.
You can read here.
I'll wake Ellse when I go back up.
There's a bed here.
But you're in it.
I was on Friday, too.
That was different, I needed
consoIation. The day was speciaI.
And on ordinary days?
We didn't sIeep
llke brother and sister.
Why not continue?
You ask God for that this morning?
It's up to you, not to God.
He can't object to your being my wife.
If I don't want to,
God doesn't either.
Now good night.
I'm feellng weak,
don't take advantage of it.
Come on.
Sometimes I'd rather be you.
Don't say that.
I mean it.
Don't want me to come?
No, I have to shop,
I've Iots to do.
All right.
Have a nice New Year's Eve.
You too. Happy New Year.
So Iong, Ellse.
No, I wanna kiss Mummy.
Kiss Loïc.
OK, we're off.
A kiss, Mummy.
Say goodbye.
Maybe we can buy him a teapot.
Pretty, aren't they?
Let's see your mouth.
CIose your mouth.
Sit straight.
Féllcie:
You're in France:
Haven't been here Iong.
That your daughter?
If you knew how dumb I am.
If you'd toId me.
I'd have understood.
It's not what you think.
I toId you the wrong town:
What?
The wrong town: I said Courbevoie
instead of Levallois.
Like that, stupidIy. A sllp.
Féllcie, this is Dora.
CharIes has spoken of you.
What a terribIe thing to happen:
I was so dumb
I gave her no address at all.
Why not?
I was moving around.
I couId have given her a mall drop.
You think others can't make errors.
This was a tremendous error.
If I'd Ieft an address,
I wouIdn't have had this probIem.
You're funny:
Give me your address.
I'll call you.
You're crazy:
You're crazy: Give me your address:
But your wife....:
She's not my wife, she's a friend.
At Ieast take my address,
so I can't intrude on your llfe.
Not scared I'll intrude on yours?
No, I've no woman in my llfe now.
No chlldren, either.
No wife? No chlldren?
Why wouId I lle to you?
I belleve you've no wife.
About the chlld...
This is my daughter?
Doesn't she Iook llke you?
And you tried to run away:
You're crazy:
I thought you were taken.
Even if I was married, or whatever...
I couIdn't have stood it.
What's her name?
Ask her.
- What's your name?
- Ellse.
Ellse:
Ask her what your name is.
- And my name?
- Daddy.
This is impossibIe:
I showed her your photos.
I had none of you.
You recognised me anyway.
You llve near here?
No. I have to take a bus
to my mother's.
What are you doing now?
Nothing speciaI.
I'll go with you if you llke.
UnIess...
Now that I've got you, I won't Iet go.
Let's catch the bus.
Mum?
I've brought you a cook.
A cook?
Why, it's...
- It's CharIes.
- It's Daddy.
We met on a bus.
On a bus?
Really? How amazing:
On a bus.
Ellse know?
She recognised him at once.
Happy you found your daddy?
My llttIe daddy...
I'm thinner than I was.
Not too much, you're stllI OK.
Even without photos,
I didn't forget you.
You've had other women
in all this time, right?
It never jelled. There were two,
and I Ieft them with no regrets.
I knew Dora
before I met you.
We date when I'm in Paris,
catch up on each other.
I won't have to tell her this bit.
You must have someone, no?
I Ieft him for someone eIse
two weeks ago.
And the ''someone eIse''?
I Ieft him a week ago, for you.
For me?
You didn't know we'd meet.
I had a premonition.
- I'm settllng in France.
- In Paris?
On the Brittany coast.
You coming with me?
- To do what?
- HeIp me.
In the kitchen?
As cashier, manager, whatever.
So I'd be the boss.
I'd llke that with you.
Then you'll come?
Wait:
RecentIy I said yes right away,
without a reaI commitment.
This time it's a Iot more serious.
I agree.
What's wrong?
Féllcie, are you crying?
I'm not... They're tears of joy.
Got a tissue?
What's the matter, sweetie?
Mummy wllI be back. She's with Daddy.
Aren't you happy to have your daddy?
You mustn't cry:
They're tears of joy.
Never mind, Mum, I'll get it.
Coming:
- Can I open it?
- It's for you.
The sallor's back.
- The sallor?
- It's what we called you.
You? Amazing: You found our address?
My sister, my brother-in-Iaw.
We met on a bus.
No kidding: That's astonishing:
The things that happen:
But Féllcie has premonitions...
I feIt you feIt something
was in the air...
