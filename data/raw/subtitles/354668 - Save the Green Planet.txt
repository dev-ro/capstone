You probably think I'm crazy.
At first, I couldn't believe it either,
thinking that it only happens in movies
Sly bastards! They are the ones
Who made all those movies.
No one believes me anymore.
I believe in you, honey...
No, you too will think I'm crazy
If you watch this.
No, you're not!
Do you really want to see this?
You're not crazy...
Name: Kang, Man Shik
Age: 45
CEO of Yuje Chemical
That's him.
He's the leader.
I'm positive.
The only one
with the royal genetic DNA code.
A respectable job...
a materialistic bitchy wife...
and spoiled kids.
They are all just disguises.
The sly dog!
He pretends to be an ordinary family man.
But, ugly feature is hidden
underneath that skin.
In fact, he's an alien
from Andromeda!
It smells fishy...
He's getting in touch with other aliens
more and more these days...
A sign that something's up.
The alien prince will soon come from
Andromeda at the next lunar eclipse.
No time to waste!
I must get him first.
Otherwise it'll be a huge disaster.
Then no one will survive.
Not a single person.
Nobody knows...
We must save the earth!
Why are you crying?
I'm so scared, honey.
Sooni!
Honey!
Save the Green Planet!
The Earth
7 days before lunar eclipse
Sir? Sir! We're here, Sir!
Get out, please!
Oh shit! Are you okay, sir?
Is this your place?
Huh? Right.
My house! All mine!
I built it all myself.
Yeah, you're a big shot.
Thanks for today. Now go!
Yes!
Sir! Your fare...
It's $40. Thank you sir.
Sir! This is only $20.
Hey! Why do you charge $40
for just a 10 minute drive?
Well, it was over 30 minutes,
but anyway it's a fixed rate.
It's your fault! Get lost!
Do you have any idea how much
it costs to gas up this car?
That's because your directions
weren't clear and...
Shut up!
Now get out of my face!
If you want to keep your job,
shut up and leave!
Shit! Fucking bastard!
Money-grubbing son-of-a-bitch.
Thinks I'm made of money...
Where the hell is my
regular driver today?
Why does his mom's birthday
come every year?
Sir! Mr. Kang!
Now what?
You're Kang Man Shik, right?
Yes. Who the hell are you?
Don't you remember me?
I'm from your hometown.
My hometown?
But I'm from Seoul!
Not...
Andromeda?
What?
I said Andromeda!
You lousy alien!
My eyes, my eyes...
Help me!
Somebody help me!
Now what, honey?

Perfect!
Absolutely no alien traits!
He stands out from the others.
Now he really looks like an alien.
Not looks like!
He is a real alien!
By the way,
why did you cut his hair?
They use their hair to
transmit telepathic signals.
Like the antennas
at broadcasting stations.
He seems to be coming to...
Already?
See! He's an extraordinary one.
No! God! It's dangerous!
What're you doing?
I told you never to take it off.
Are you crazy?
Honey...
Sooni, his telepathy is still strong.
Even from this distance,
he can still hurt you bad.
Honey, I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.
Okay. Always be careful!
He's particularly dangerous.
Then, I have to wear this?
It causes headaches.
Just a little bit longer.
Until his nervous systems weakens.
Really? How?
< Super Mentholatum Rub >
Strangely enough, their genetic
structure is the same as ours.
But their nervous system
is totally different.
The antihistamine in this mentholatum rub
reacts with the neurotransmitters
in their nervous system...
and shuts it down,
breaking it down.
Then he becomes helpless.
Can I rub it anywhere?
No, they have 3 weak points.
Three?
Eyes
Feet
And... and...
We'll start with the feet.
Do I just rub it in?
First, to help it absorb,
we need to remove some skin.
This will do.
How am I doing?
Is this too much?
No, that's okay.
It's working, honey!
Spread evenly!
Honey!
Breakfast is ready!
Good morning.
This is YTN news at 9.
Mr. Kang, CEO of Yuje Chemical
and son-in-law of the Chief of Police...
has been missing since yesterday.
The police suspect it's someone...
who knows Mr. Kang and
is currently questioning his acquaintances...
Hey! Detective Chu!
What are you doing here?
Smell money?
Don't get in my way...
...if you value your life, got it?
Crazy jerk!
Search the place top to bottom.
Don't miss a thing!
Find me something.
Evidence!
Chief Chu! Chief Chu!
It is you!
You really look rumpled
in person...
You've found something, right?
I know it!
I don't know who you are but
get the hell out of my face.
Don't hang around with me.
I know you're framed and it was a trap.
Fuck off, boy...
What?
You're the graduate from
Seoul National University?
Yes, I'm Kim from the Violent Crimes Division.
I'm a huge fan of yours...
I remember the gas station case
from when I was 15.
Ever since then...
you've been my hero.
So you want my autograph?
You want this case, right?
I can help you.
I don't need any help.
Beat it.
Fine! But I know that
you won't drop this case.
Chief Officer Lee
isn't going to like it.
Are you threatening me?
No! Just helping.
You made me what I am today.
It's called "Intenz,"
a kind of methamphetamine.
Like crystal meth.
3 of these and the world is yours.
Even better when taken with alcohol
There was no other evidence.
This might be a good clue.
Really?
It takes only 5 seconds to kick in.
Then I'll start with hospitals
that use those pills.
So will you arrest every single
taker?
Don't you get it?
This is no ordinary psycho.
Think he'd bother with prescriptions?
Then you mean they're stolen?
Aren't you jumping to conclusions?
It's too early to conclude...
This lottery ticket,
just two possibilities.
Jackpot or not.
Guilty... or not.
Think simple.
50/50.
Son of a bitch!
You're a threat to this earth!
No wonder aliens look down on us!
Get it?
Yes...
Why aren't you answering me?
Why so many metholatum sprays?
Did you get beaten up again?
It's for bee stings.
You must have gotten stung a lot.
Damn! Nothing's easy.
I was thinking of keeping bees.
Is ignoring me funny?
We were in middle school,
high school, and the factory together.
We haven't seen each other for
so long, and you don't even say "Hi"
Be polite, bastard!
OK... Nice to see you...
Nice? Yeah, you'll see me more
often from now on.
I got laid off last week.
Hey moron, be careful.
I don't know what you're doing
up on that mountain...
but I'll be watching you.
Okay.
Get out of here.
What's wrong?
Who's that?
That loser always ruins my day.
Did you get them?
It's funny, that someone like me
is doing this...
As if I still have something
to live for.
But that will change soon.
People will know
who really saved the Earth.
They'll know who the real hero is.
What's going on here?
Where... am I?
You're such a liar.
Stop acting!
I know everything.
What do you know?
I know why you came here
from Andromeda.
I know what you're up to!
And I know what you did
to my mother!
I know your real name is
#@% #&#$&@ +%
I know it all!!
Surprised?
You'll be even more surprised
when you see your alien Prince
sitting right beside you.
P... prince?
You're the only one who can contact him.
The royal genetic DNA code!
Royal what?
Just let me meet him.
I'll take care of the rest.
What the hell are you talking about?
What Andromeda? What prince?
What kind of bullshit
are you babbling about?
Oh! You don't know?
Then I'll make you know.
Your kind is tough
Humans die easily at 100 volts.
But you're different.
Your kind can withstand 200 volts
Sooni!
Higher.
More.
Honey...
Higher!
Everybody is the same.
At first, you say you don't know a thing...
but eventually you all confess.
Because... pain is something
you can never get used to.
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you know who I am?
I know very well.
What do you want?
Money? I'll give you money!
I even have secret accounts
and can get you money that's untraceable.
Money?
Money!
Money?!!
Do you think I'm doing this
just for money?
This isn't for the money!
You terrible extraterrestrial freak!
N... no!
It must be for the money.
Jechun branch of Nonghyup Bank.
2 minutes and he disappeared.
How much?
$4,000.
Only $4,000?
Kidnap the CEO of Yuje Chemicals
just for $4,000?
Maybe he's small-minded.
Will he keep withdrawing like that?
A genius or an idiot?
What do you think?
Well, I don't know.
Don't cancel any of the cards.
If the chief's daughter becomes
a widow, we're done for.
Yes, sir.
Wait!
Rewind it a bit.
From there.
Can you darken it?
Yes.
Just a little more.
Stop.
Enlarge it.
Focus on the license plate.
Can you read it?
Yes, a few numbers.
Good job!
Now, get back to work!
- Alleged involvement in stock fraud-
- Not guilty-
- Kang Man Shik's not guilty
judging manipulated? -
- Unfaithful?
Exec caught with top actress. -
- Kang Man Shik assaulted-
Is it for tomorrow?
Boiled? Fried?
I prefer boiled.
I warned you already
to stay away from me.
It won't do you any good
to hang around me.
This is the list of hospitals
that reported stolen pills.
You're out of your mind.
Don't worry.
This might be easy.
I got this because he withdrew
$4,000 yesterday, using Kang's card.
I said be simple, not stupid.
Think and use what I taught you!
Do you know how hard it is to kidnap
a rich bastard like this?
The walls around him are thick,
and he does nothing by accident.
The kidnapper has invested tons of
time and effort on this.
You think he'd show his face on
camera for a measly $4,000?
The crazy bastard I'm looking for
isn't that stupid.
Why do you think all these cases
were done by the same person?
Just a hunch.
It's a gift... look into it.
Well, well, well.
Makes me jealous.
What have we here?
Secret meetings?
They say you should never get your hopes up,
because you'll just be disappointed.
Look at yourself, leading kids astray.
Tired of cooking lessons?
Hey, Earth, my little dog.
Why didn't you eat much?
You want alien meat?
I'll give you a treat soon, just wait.
Earth's house
Honey!
See? You're still alive.
I told you that you're an alien.
Now will you help me meet the Prince?
Now I remember who you are.
Do you know what my I.Q. Is?
Do you think I can forget guys like you?
You were the one who
threw eggs at me!
Lee, Byung Goo. You worked
at the Gangneung factory, right?
Why are you doing this?
Is this about your mother?
I paid you enough, you bastard!
What more do you want?
What the hell am I supposed
to do about it now?
Or is this about your girlfriend?
I didn't kill her, you crazy shit!
It's not my goddamn problem.
Where are you running to?
Untie me right now!
Untie me, you demented fuck.
Byung Goo, honey...
Leave me alone!
Honey.
That sly alien!
Mom, do you remember
those tiny umbrellas
that you used to make
when I was young?
I used to get all wet.
Can't you remember?
The umbrellas that saved us...
Oh, my Byung Goo.
It must be hard for you.
Still, you have to endure.
Only you can...
...save the Earth.
Mom...
Sooni... Sooni!
5 minutes later
It's weird, I can't stop.
Sooni!
You think I'm an alien, too?
Byung Goo's crazy.
He's out of his mind.
He must have watched
too many movies.
Sooni... you know it in your heart, right?
Sooni, you must help him!
Help him not to hurt anymore.
I miss my kids.
Sooni! Don't go.
Come back and untie me!
He doesn't love you!
There was somebody else.
This is revenge
for his dead lover!
He's using you!
He never loved you!
You're being deceived.
Sooni! What's wrong?
Sooni...
Honey... I...
Say it.
Honey, do you love me?
Sooni... I...
Have a drink.
People do this after breaking-up.
Drink it. It will make it less painful.
How did you make her leave?
Telepathy?
What? Who made who go?
Good!!
It's better that she left.
She was too fragile...
...to endure this anyway.
3 days before lunar eclipse
Oh, don't make me remember that.
We were all nearly fired because...
$20,000 worth of drugs were stolen.
Highly restricted medicine.
Even the director was sacked.
When was this exactly?
Well, around this day, about 5 years ago.
Do you have any patients
related to Yuje Chemicals?
Employees?
She's been in the same state
for 5 years.
As good as dead.
A vegetable.
What's the diagnosis?
Well, I'm not sure.
It seems to be some kind of poisoning,
but even the doctors don't know.
Can I have some information
about her guardian?
There's a son who refuses to
take her off of life support.
He's been looking after her
for the past 5 years.
Let me see... the last payment
was quite late but...
Look here, June 28th, $3,700,
payment received.
He's the best son ever.
You can't find anyone like that
these days.
What's wrong with your face?
What are you up to?
I'm not up to anything.
I can't even breathe.
I think I'm dying!
Don't worry.
You're not dying.
Your kind doesn't die easily.
This is going in
until it reaches your intestine.
No one is strong enough
to stand it for more than an hour.
It might kill you, but you know...
The lunar eclipse is getting close.
This is useless.
You can't beat me.
Do you know why?
Because I've never lost
to dumb-fucks like you.
I know your kind very well
useless fucking morons.
Never taking responsibility.
Always blaming others.
You still are scared of me,
aren't you?
You can't even come near
without those pills.
Cowards like you always
lose eventually.
So stop acting crazy and give up,
before more terrible shit happens.
I think you're the one
who's going crazy.
You never shut up, even though
you have no idea what's going on.
Can you guess
where this is going to go?
Oh, shit!
You will never beat me,
you crazy fucker.
You son of a bitch!
Do you know how hard it's been for me
because of fuckers like you?
You ungrateful creatures!
How dare you challenge me,
you psychotic freak!
Do you think
I'm just going to give up?
Tell me, you bitch.
If I don't get out,
you don't get out either.
You're trapped now too.
Help! Somebody help!!
Help!
Here I am!
Help!
Help!
Over here!
Help!
Die, you insane freak!
What? Speechless because you were tricked
by an insane freak?
Don't you get it?
No one can save you.
Hello? Anybody home?
Anyone home?
Anybody home?
Who... are you?
Oh, I am... a detective.
Is there something wrong?
No, I was just wondering
if you could put me up for the night?
I was tracking poachers.
But now it's getting very late.
Too late to head back so...
People told me about your place.
If you don't mind,
could I stay the night?
Of course not. Come on in.
It's very late. It's better to stay.
Come in.
You're not the first person
to stay here.
The mountain is too much
for one day.
I like your house.
I wish I could give up everything
and live in a place like this.
Mind if I look around?
No problem.
Did you build it yourself?
Yes. It's been 5 years,
but it's not finished yet.
People call this place the
"bath house."
It used to be a bath house
for miners.
Right where you're standing.
You mean, you built a house
on top of a bath house?
To use as a workshop.
I make mannequins, as a hobby
and for some extra money.
I thought they were made in factories.
Most people think so,
but they're all handmade.
Oh, is that right?
Do you want to see my workshop?
We can go down and
check it out.
There's a secret path.
Maybe next time.
Look! A UFO!!
A UFO?
Where... Where is it?
It's already gone.
Here you go.
You put glue on
the factory director's penis?
Real strong glue...
Stuck his penis to his belly...
It's funny now,
but I was so mad then.
Especially after what happened
to your mother.
I was so angry,
I wanted to kill everybody.
Strangely, my anger made me hungry.
So I ate. Then threw up, and ate again...
So you ate and threw up...
ate and threw up...
Until you had nothing left.
Ah, life's a hell of a thing
Shit! This feels good.
Let me do it.
What's all that?
Do you believe in... aliens?
Aliens?
Actually, I've been studying about aliens.
That's why I live here.
Like in the movies?
Where space aliens attack the Earth?
That kind of stuff?
No, aliens are not that aggressive.
People just feel scared out of ignorance.
In fact, aliens send messages of hope.
They're trying to enlighten us,
help us evolve into righteous creatures.
Read this carefully.
It changed my life.
The Road to Space Humans
- Message of Love and Peace-
Freeze!
Mr. Chu, what's wrong?
Oh. I heard noises.
You gave me quite a scare.
I'm sorry if I did so.
I couldn't sleep...
What's that?
Oh, this?
It's just a transmitter.
Transmitter?
Yes, to send messages to aliens.
