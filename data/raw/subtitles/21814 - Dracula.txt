"Among the rugged peaks that frown
down upon the Borgo Pass...
are found crumbling castles
of a bygone age."
- I say, driver, a bit slower.
- No, no!
- We must reach the inn before sundown.
- And why, pray?
It is Walpurgis night,
the night of evil.
Nosferatu...
On this night, madame,
the doors, they are barred...
and to the Virgin we pray.
I say, porter...
Don't take my luggage down.
I'm going on to Borgo Pass tonight.
No, no, please.
Put that back up there.
The driver, he is afraid.
Walpurgis night.
Good fellow, he is.
He wants me to ask if you can wait...
and go on after sunrise.
Well, I'm sorry, but there's a carriage
meeting me at Borgo Pass at midnight.
- Borgo Pass?
- Yes.
- Whose carriage?
- Count Dracula's.
- Count Dracula's?
- Yes.
Castle Dracula?
Yes, that's where I'm going.
- To the castle?
- Yes.
No. You mustn't go there.
We people of the mountains
believe...
at the castle there are vampires!
Dracula and his wives.
They take the form
of wolves and bats.
They leave their coffins at night...
and they feed on the blood
of the living.
Oh, but that's all superstition.
Why, l...
I can't understand why...
Look... the sun.
When it is gone,
they leave their coffins.
Come. We must go indoors.
But wait!
I mean, just a minute, l...
What I'm trying to say
is that I'm not afraid.
I've explained to the driver that
it's a matter of business with me.
I've got to go. Really.
Well, good night.
Wait. Please.
If you must go, wear this,
for your mother's sake.
It will protect you.
The coach from Count Dracula?
Hey, driver!
I say, driver, what do you mean
by going at this...
I am Dracula.
It's really good to see you.
I don't know what happened
to the driver and my luggage and...
Well, and with all this, l... I thought
I was in the wrong place.
I bid you welcome.
Listen to them.
Children of the night.
What music they make.
The spider spinning his web
for the unwary fly.
The blood is the life, Mr. Renfield.
Why, uh...
Yes.
I'm sure you will find this part
of my castle more inviting.
Well, rather.
It's quite different from outside.
Oh, and the fire, it...
It's so cheerful.
I didn't know but that
you might be hungry.
Thank you. That's very kind of you,
but I'm a bit worried about my luggage.
You see, all your papers were in...
I took the liberty of having
your luggage brought up.
Allow me.
Oh, yes.
Thanks.
I trust you have kept
your coming here a secret.
I've followed your
instructions implicitly.
Excellent, Mr. Renfield.
Excellent.
And now, if you're not too fatigued,
I would like to discuss...
the lease on Carfax Abbey.
Oh, yes.
Everything is in order...
awaiting your signature.
Well, here. Here's the lease.
Why, uh, I hope I've brought
enough labels for your luggage.
I'm taking with me
only three, uh, boxes.
Very well.
I have chartered a ship
to take us to England.
We will be leaving...
tomorrow evening.
Everything will be ready.
I hope you will find this comfortable.
Thanks. It looks very inviting.
Ouch!
Oh, it's nothing serious.
Just a small cut from that paper clip.
It's just a scratch.
This is very old wine.
I hope you will like it.
Aren't you drinking?
I never drink... wine.
Well.
- It's delicious.
- Now I'll leave you.
Well, good night.
Good night,
Mr. Renfield.
Master, the sun is gone!
You will keep your promise when
we get to London, won't you, Master?
You will see that I get lives?
Not human lives, but small ones...
with blood in them.
I'll be loyal to you, Master.
I'll be loyal!
Must be a Scandinavian ship.
That's what it looks to me like.
Here now, here now,
get back.
Nobody goes aboard this here
boat but the authorities.
The captain dead,
tied to the wheel.
Horrible tragedy, horrible tragedy.
Master, we're here!
You can't hear what I'm saying,
but we're here!
We're safe!
They must have come
through a terrible storm.
What's that?
Why, it's come
from that hatchway!
Why, he's mad! Look at his eyes.
Why, the man's gone crazy.
Violets! Violets!
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole, sir.
Flower for your buttonhole.
Here's a nice one.
And after you deliver the message,
you will remember nothing
I now say.
Obey.
- Dr. Seward?
- Yes?
- You're wanted on the telephone.
- Thank you.
- Well, excuse me, dear.
- Oh, Father, if it's from home,
will you say I'm spending the night
in town with Lucy?
All right, dear.
Pardon me. I could not help
overhearing your name.
Might I inquire if you are
the Dr. Seward...
whose sanitarium is at Whitby?
- Why, yes.
- I'm Count Dracula.
I have just leased Carfax Abbey.
- I understand it adjoins your grounds.
- Why, yes, it does.
I'm very happy to make
your acquaintance.
May I present my daughter Mina?
- Count Dracula.
- Miss Western.
- How do you do?
- And Mr. Harker.
How do you do?
Count Dracula's just taken
Carfax Abbey.
Oh, it'll be a relief to see light
in those dismal old windows.
It will indeed. You'll excuse me,
I'm wanted on the telephone.
The abbey could be very attractive,
but I should imagine...
it would need
quite extensive repairs.
I shall do very little repairing.
It reminds me
of the broken battlements...
of my own castle in Transylvania.
The abbey always reminds me
of that old toast...
about lofty timbers.
The walls around are bare,
echoing to our laughter
as though the dead were there."
- Nice little sentiment.
But there's more,
even nicer.
Pass a cup to the dead already,
a round for the next to die...
- Oh, never mind the rest, dear.
To die, to be really dead,
that must be glorious.
Why, Count Dracula!
There are far worse things...
awaiting man...
than death.
It reminds me...
of the broken battlements...
of my own castle in Transylvania.
Oh, Lucy.
You're so romantic.
Laugh all you like.
I think he's fascinating.
Oh, I suppose he's all right.
But give me someone
a little more normal.
Like John?
Yes, dear, like John.
Castle... Dracula!
Transylvania.
Well, Countess,
I'll leave you to your count
and his ruined abbey.
- Good night, Lucy.
Good night, dear.
The park seems to be
closing down a bit, sir.
- Another death.
- Dead.
Dr. Seward, when did Miss Western
have the last transfusion?
About four hours ago.
An unnatural loss of blood...
which we've been
powerless to check.
On the throat of each victim,
the same two marks.
He probably wants his flies again!
- No, Martin, please!
Please don't, Martin!
Oh, Martin, please!
Please, Martin!
No, Martin!
- Oh, Martin, please! No, no, no, Martin!
- Here, give it to me!
No, Martin! Martin, don't!
Don't throw my spider
away from me. Oh, Martin.
Ain't you ashamed now?
Ain't ya?
Spiders now, is it?
Flies ain't good enough?
Flies? Flies?
Poor, puny things.
- Who wants to eat flies?
- You do, ya loony.
Not when I can get nice, fat spiders!
All right. Have it your own way.
Read where I have marked.
Gentlemen,
we are dealing with the undead.
Nosferatu?
Yes, Nosferatu,
the undead, the vampire.
The vampire attacks the throat.
It leaves two little wounds,
white with red centers.
Dr. Seward, your patient Renfield,
whose blood I have just analyzed,
is obsessed with the idea...
that he must devour living things...
in order to sustain his own life.
But, Professor Van Helsing,
modern medical science...
does not admit of such a creature.
The vampire is a pure myth,
superstition.
I may be able to bring you proof...
that the superstition
of yesterday can become...
the scientific reality of today.
But, Professor, Renfield's cravings...
have always been
for small living things.
- Nothing human.
- As far as we know, Doctor.
But you tell me
that he escapes from his room.
He is gone for hours.
Where does he go?
Well, Mr. Renfield,
you are looking much better than you did
this morning when I arrived.
Thanks, I'm feeling much better.
I am here to help you.
You understand that, do you not?
Why, of course. And I'm very grateful.
- Keep your filthy hands to yourself!
- Now, now, Renfield.
Oh, Dr. Seward,
send me away from this place.
Send me far away.
Why are you so anxious
to get away?
My cries at night,
they might disturb Miss Mina.
Yes?
They might give her bad dreams,
Professor Van Helsing.
Bad dreams.
- That sounded like a wolf.
- Yes, it did.
But I hardly think there are wolves
so near London.
He thinks they're wolves.
Me, I've heard 'em...
howl at night before.
He thinks they're talking to him.
He howls and howls back at them.
He's crazy!
I might have known.
I might have known.
We know why the wolves talk,
do we not, Mr. Renfield?
And we know how
we can make them stop.
Aaah!
- You know too much to live, Van Helsing.
- Now, now, Renfield.
We'll get no more out of him
now for a while.
- Take him away, Martin.
- On your way, old fly eater.
I'm warning you, Dr. Seward.
If you don't send me away,
you must answer
for what will happen to Miss Mina!
- All right, Martin.
- Come along, now, come along.
What was that herb
that excited him so?
Wolfbane. It is a plant
that grows in central Europe.
The natives there use it
to protect themselves against vampires.
Renfield reacted
very violently to its scent.
Seward, I want you
to have Renfield closely watched...
by day and night, especially by night.
Yes, Master.
Master, you've come back.
No, Master, please!
Please don't ask me to do that!
Don't! Not her!
Please! Please don't, Master!
Don't, please!
Please! Oh, don't!
I lay in bed
for quite a while, reading.
And just as I was
commencing to get drowsy,
I heard dogs howling.
And when the dream came,
it seemed the whole room
was filled with mist.
It was so thick...
I could just see the lamp by the bed,
a tiny spark in the fog.
And then I saw two red eyes
staring at me,
and a white livid face
came down out of the mist.
It came closer...
and closer.
I felt its breath on my face,
and then its lips.
- Oh.
- Dear, it was only a dream.
And then, in the morning,
I felt so weak.
It seemed as if all the life
had been drained out of me.
Darling, we're going
to forget all about these dreams,
think about something cheerful,
aren't we?
Allow me.
Oh, certainly, Professor.
Think for a moment.
Is there anything that might have
brought this dream on?
No.
Doctor, there's something
troubling Mina,
something she won't tell us.
And the face in the dream,
you say it seemed to come
closer and closer?
The lips touched you? Where?
Is there anything the matter
with your throat?
- Oh, no, but l...
- Permit me.
- No, please!
- Yes, yes.
How long have you had
those little marks?
Marks?
- Please.
- Mina, why didn't you let us know?
Do not excite her.
When, Miss Mina?
Since the morning after the dream.
What could have
caused them, Professor?
Count Dracula!
It's good to see you
back again, Doctor.
I heard you have just arrived.
And you, Miss Mina.
You're looking exceptionally...
Pardon me, Dr. Seward,
but I think Miss Mina should
go to her room at once.
Professor Van Helsing,
I don't believe it's as important
as you seem to think it is.
Excuse me.
Count Dracula, Professor Van Helsing.
Van Helsing.
A most distinguished scientist
whose name we know...
even in the wilds of Transylvania.
I had a frightful dream
a few nights ago,
and I don't seem to be able
to get it out of my mind.
I hope you haven't taken
my stories too seriously.
Stories?
Yes.
In my humble effort to amuse
your fiancée, Mr. Harker,
I was telling her
some rather grim tales...
of my far-off country.
- I can imagine.
- Why, John!
I can quite understand
Mr. Harker's concern.
I'm afraid it's quite serious.
My dear, I'm sure
Count Dracula will excuse you.
You must go to your room
as Professor Van Helsing suggests.
Oh, but really, Father,
I'm feeling quite well.
You had better do
as your father advises.
Very well. Good night.
John.
Miss Mina? May I call later
and inquire how you're feeling?
Why, yes. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Doctor.
My visit was so ill-timed.
Not at all.
On the contrary, it may prove
to be most enlightening.
In fact, before you go,
you can be of definite service.
Anything I can do. Gladly.
A moment ago,
I stumbled upon...
a most amazing phenomenon,
something so incredible...
I mistrust my own judgment.
Look.
Dr. Seward, my humble apology.
I dislike mirrors.
Van Helsing will explain.
For one who has not lived
even a single lifetime,
you are a wise man, Van Helsing.
- Whew.
- What on earth caused that?
Did you see the look on his face?
Like a wild animal!
Wild animal? Like a madman!
What's that running across the lawn?
Looks like a huge dog!
Or a wolf?
- A wolf?
- He was afraid we might follow.
- Follow?
- Sometimes they take the form of wolves,
but generally of bats.
- What are you talking about?
- Dracula.
But what's Dracula got to do
with wolves and bats?
- Dracula is our vampire.
- But surely, Professor...
A vampire casts
no reflection in the glass.
That is why Dracula
smashed the mirror.
I don't mean to be rude,
but that's the sort of thing I'd expect
one of the patients here to say.
Yes, and that is what
your English doctors would say,
your police.
The strength of the vampire
is that people will not believe in him.
Professor, vampires only exist
in ghost stories.
A vampire, Mr. Harker,
is a being that lives after its death
by drinking the blood of the living.
It must have blood or it dies.
Its power lasts only
from sunset to sunrise.
During the hours of the day,
it must rest in the earth
in which it was buried.
But then, if Dracula were a vampire,
he'd have to return every night
to Transylvania, and that's impossible.
Then he must have brought
his native soil with him, boxes of it.
Boxes of earth large enough
for him to rest in.
Renfield?
What are you doing there?
Come here.
Did you hear what we were saying?
Yes, I heard something.
Enough.
Be guided by what he says.
It's your only hope.
It's her only hope.
I begged you to send me away,
but you wouldn't.
Now it's too late.
It's happened again.
What's happened?
Take her away from here.
Take her away before...
No, no, Master!
I wasn't going to say anything!
I told them nothing!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
What have you to do with Dracula?
Dracula?
I never even heard the name before.
You will die in torment if you die
with innocent blood on your soul.
Oh, no.
God will not damn a lunatic's soul.
He knows that the powers of evil
are too great...
for those of us with weak minds.
Oh, Mr. Harker!
Mr. Harker, it's horrible!
Oh, it's horrible! Dr. Seward!
- Miss Mina, out there dead!
- Where? Where?
- Out there!
Thank heaven, she's alive.
Thank heaven for that.
Alive, yes, but in greater danger,
for she's already
under his influence.
It's horrible, Van Helsing, horrible!
Incredible.
Incredible, perhaps,
but...
Further attacks on small children
committed after dark...
by the mysterious woman in white
took place last night.
Narratives of two small girls,
each child describing...
a beautiful lady in white
who promised her chocolates,
enticed her to a secluded spot...
and there bit her slightly
in the throat."
- Ghosts.
- Vampires.
- And then, Miss Mina?
- Well, how could she know...
anything about
the woman in white?
It's bad enough for her
to read it in the newspaper...
Please, please, Mr. Harker.
And when was the next time
you saw Miss Lucy...
after she was buried?
I was downstairs...
on the terrace.
She came out of the shadows
and stood looking at me.
I started to speak to her.
And then I remembered
she was dead.
The most horrible expression
came over her face.
She looked like a hungry animal.
A wolf.
And then she turned
and ran back into the dark.
Then you know
the woman in white is...
Lucy.
Miss Mina, I promise you
that after tonight...
she will remain at rest,
her soul released from this horror.
If you can save Lucy's soul after death,
promise me you'll save mine.
Darling, you're not going to die,
you're going to live.
No, John. You mustn't touch me.
And you mustn't kiss me...
ever again.
What are you trying to say?
You tell him.
You make him understand.
I can't.
Professor?
It's all over, John.
Our love, our life together.
Oh, no.
No, no, don't look at me like that.
I love you, John.
You.
But this horror, he wills it.
Miss Mina, you must come indoors.
You must.
You know what you're doing to her,
Professor? You're driving her crazy!
Mr. Harker, that is what
you should be worrying about.
The last rays of the day's sun
will soon be gone,
and another night will be upon us.
Dr. Seward, I'm taking Mina
with me to London tonight...
or I'll call in the police.
- But, John...
- Mina, please get your bags packed.
Seward, I must be master here
or I can do nothing.
- Right.
- Miss Mina,
both this room and your bedroom
have been prepared with wolfbane.
You will be safe
if Dracula returns.
She'll be safe, all right,
because she's going with me.
Mina, I'll be waiting
for you in the library.
Oh, John! Father, talk to him.
Please don't let him go.
Oh, Briggs.
Miss Mina is to wear this wreath
of wolfbane when she goes to bed.
Watch her closely, and see that
she does not remove it in her sleep.
- I understand, Professor.
- And under no circumstances...
must these windows
be opened tonight.
Very well, sir.
You will recollect that Dracula cast
no reflection in the mirror.
Yes.
And that three boxes of earth
were delivered to him at Carfax Abbey.
Quite.
Knowing a vampire must rest
by day in his native soil,
I am convinced
that this Dracula is no legend...
but an undead creature whose life
has been unnaturally prolonged.
Well, Dr. Seward, what about it?
Is Mina going with me or not?
If you take her from under
our protection, you will kill her.
Now, John, please,
please, be patient.
Mister Harker, please, come here.
Well.
John, I know you love her,
but don't forget she's my daughter,
and I must do what I think is best.
Mr. Harker,
I have devoted my lifetime
to the study of many strange things,
little-known facts which the world
is perhaps better off not knowing.
I know,
but, Professor, all I want is
to get Mina away from all of this.
That will do no good.
Our only chance of saving
Miss Mina's life...
is to find the hiding place
of Dracula's living corpse...
and to drive a stake
through its heart.
Isn't this a strange conversation...
for men who aren't crazy?
Renfield, you're compelling
me to put you in a straitjacket.
You forget, Doctor,
that madmen have great strength.
Dracula has great strength,
eh, Renfield?
Words, words, words.
Oh, Martin. Didn't I warn you
to keep a strict watch?
What? What? Again?
Yes, sir. At once, sir.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
Here. The doctor's
pet loony is loose again.
He came and stood below my window
in the moonlight.
And he promised me things.
Not in words,
but by doing them.
Doing them?
By making them happen.
A red mist spread over the lawn,
coming on like a flame of fire.
And then he parted it.
And I could see...
that there were thousands of rats...
with their eyes blazing red,
like his, only smaller.
And then he held up his hand,
and they all stopped.
And I thought he seemed to be saying,
Rats. Rats.
Rats!"
Thousands,
millions of them.
All red blood,
all these will I give you...
if you will obey me."
What did he want you to do?
That which has
already been done.
Strike me down dead, Doctor.
He's got me going.
Now he's twisted and broken
them iron bars as if they was cheese.
- Dracula is in the house.
- In the house?
Doctor, this time he can do no harm.
We are ready for him.
Martin, come with me. I'll show you
where we can put Mr. Renfield...
where he won't escape again.
All right, but I have me doubts.
Come along, old fly eater.
You mustn't get out of it this time.
I'm awfully sorry,
but you've got to stay in your room.
Van Helsing.
Now that you have learned
what you have learned,
it would be well for you to return
to your own country.
I prefer to remain...
and protect those
whom you would destroy.
You are too late.
My blood now flows through her veins.
She will live through
the centuries to come,
as I have lived.
Should you escape us, Dracula,
we know how to save Miss Mina's soul,
if not her life.
If she dies by day.
But I shall see
that she dies by night.
And I will have Carfax Abbey
torn down stone by stone,
excavated a mile around.
I will find your earth box
and drive that stake through your heart.
Come here.
Come...
here.
Your will... is strong,
Van Helsing.
More... wolfbane?
More effective than wolfbane, Count.
Indeed...
Open the window and let in some air.
The odor in the room
from that horrible weed is stifling.
But the professor gave orders.
Oh, never mind the professor now.
Now, please, go back to bed at once.
I'm going to call your father.
- What is it, Briggs?
- Oh, I don't know, Mr. Harker.
I felt strangely dizzy.
And when it cleared away,
Miss Mina was up and dressed
and out on the terrace.
- And I can't get her to go to bed.
- Well, let me see her.
- Tell her I'm here.
- John.
Oh, John, I'm so glad you're here.
Well, what have they
been doing to me, dear?
Locking me in my room.
And the horrible smell
of that awful weed.
It's been like a nightmare.
What's been the matter?
Why are you looking at me like that?
Mina.
You're so... like a changed girl.
- Oh, you look wonderful.
- I feel wonderful.
I've never felt better in my life.
Oh, I'm so glad
to see you like this.
- I've been awfully worried about you.
- Mr. Harker.
You better bring Miss Mina inside.
That's all right, Briggs,
now that I'm here.
Run along, Briggs. Don't worry.
John. Look, the fog's lifting.
- See how plain you can see the stars?
- Yes.
Millions of them.
I've never seen them so close.
Why, it looks as if
you could reach out and touch them.
Would you like me to get you a hat...
Why, what's the matter?
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.
Come.
Let's sit down.
Van Helsing.
Seward, that which I feared
from the beginning has happened.
What?
Dracula boasts that he has fused
his blood with that of Miss Mina.
In life she will now become
the foul thing of the night that he is.
But, Van Helsing...
Come, Seward. There's
not a moment to be lost.
Oh, but I love the fog.
I love nights with fog.
But only yesterday you said
you were afraid of the night.
But, darling, I could never have said
anything so silly.
I couldn't. I love the night.
That's the only time
I feel really alive.
- There's that bat again.
Yes?
Look out.
He'll get in your hair.
Yes?
- My, that was a big bat.
I will.
You will what?
Oh, I didn't say anything.
- Yes, you did. You said, I will.
- Oh, no, I didn't.
John, come. Sit down.
There must be some way,
some way to save her.
- There is only one...
- John.
That funny little old professor,
he has a crucifix.
Now, I want you to get it
away from him and hide it.
But why, dear?
Oh, he'll be wanting
to protect me again...
from the night or Count Dracula
or whatever it is.
Well, I don't know.
He may be right, Mina.
Your eyes.
They look at me so strangely.
Mina.
- Mina, you're...
- No, Mina, no!
Give me that. What's the idea?
Have you gone crazy?
Are you trying to frighten her
to death?
No, I was trying to save her.
Save her? That's a fine way.
It's all right, darling.
Oh, John, darling,
you must go away from me...
The cross... put it away.
After what's happened,
I can't bear to look at it.
- What's happened?
- I can't tell you. I can't.
Ah, but you must. You must tell me.
I have a right to know.
Oh, John.
You can believe everything he says.
It's all the truth.
- Dracula, he...
- Dracula?
Well, what... what's he done to you,
dearie? Tell me.
He came to me.
He opened a vein in his arm
and he made me drink...
What is it? Who is it, Martin?
It's that big gray bat again, sir.
It's no use of wasting
your bullets, Martin.
They cannot harm that bat.
No, sir.
He's crazy.
They're all crazy.
They're all crazy, except you and me.
Sometimes I have me doubts
about you.
Yes.
That's Renfield.
What's he doing at the abbey?
Come, Mr. Harker.
Master! Master, I'm here!
Where else would he be going
but to Dracula?
What is it, Master?
What do you want me to do?
Look, here's an opening.
Mina!
Mina!
I didn't lead them here, Master.
I didn't know. I swear.
- No! No!
- Wait!
I'm loyal to you, Master.
I'm your slave. I didn't betray you.
Oh, no, don't! Don't kill me!
Let me live, please!
Punish me, torture me,
but let me live!
I can't die with all those lives
on my conscience!
All that blood on my hands!
Mina! Mina!
He'll kill her if we don't get to her.
We must not be too late.
We have him trapped. Day is breaking.
We have him trapped.
- He's killing her.
Mina! Mina, where are you?
Mina. Mina.
Mina, where are you?
Mina!
Mina! Mina!
Harker! Harker!
- Yes?
- Come.
Where? Where are you?
Here. Here, Harker.
I have found them.
Get me a piece of stone, anything.
It will help me drive the stake
through their hearts.
Is she... How is she?
She is not here.
Then... Then she may be alive.
Mina! Mina!
Mina!
Mina!
Mina!
Mina! Mina!
Oh, John. John, darling.
I heard you calling,
but I couldn't say anything.
We thought he'd killed you, dear.
The daylight stopped him.
Oh, if you could have seen
the look on his face.
There's nothing more to fear, Miss Mina.
Dracula is dead forever.
No, no, no. You must go.
But aren't you coming with us?
Not yet, presently.
Come, John.
