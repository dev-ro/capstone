- This is not a playground, huh?
- Fuck you, you drunk fool!
Morning.
Hi, boys. Stop that, man!
Those partridges, it has
to be some real matured partridges.
Not some of that crap
like they sell here.
A lot of meat on the chest and good legs.
They will be stuffed with roasted almonds
and fresh spices -
and then in the oven,
until they are juicy tensed.
And then my own rosemary sauce.
There was fuckin' no dry eyes.
Simon Spies was a
fuckin' great man.
- Yes, he fuckin' was.
- He was a capitalist by heart.
I remember once,
he sent a plane to China, -
just because they had some mushrooms,
I couldn't get here.
- He exploded people.
- You don't know shit, man.
- He abused his power.
- Oh shut up.
Connie's sister has known
his Jannie.
Yes, they worked together in Fotex.
Can't you imagine that?
I would fuckin' like
to see you cook.
I haven't cooked food since Simon
died, and I never will again.
Then we'll miss this
"tornerio rossini".
- Stig, go get some beers.
- Do it yourself, Kaj.
- Stop it, Connie.
- You jump and dance for him.
- That's fuckin' none of your concern?
- Relax.
Just because you started school,
you are not in charge.
It's damn well me,
who decides, what Stig must do.
Shut up, Connie.
It doesn't mean a shit.
Cheers.
Okay. Bye. It was Jens.
- The captain is on the way.
- The meeting is dissolved.
I'll vaporize too.
- I just had my beer.
- The captain is on the way.
- Come, Kaj. Let's go.
- That's my goddamn own decision!
You know the captain.
I can fuckin' decide myself,
when I've finished my beer!
Hell, Kaj. You are well aware
that you may not drink during work hours.
- I'll pull a day off your salary. - Not
fuckin' 10 minutes before knocking-off time!
You can drink all the beers
you want after 4 pm.
You ask for it yourself.
Have I asked to be together
with you, little schoolteacher?
- I don't want to discuss this with
you. - What the hell are you
standing around here for then?
- I've been working for 25 years...
- You'll be withdrawn for a day!
I've been working harder
than you ever will in your whole life.
Such a schoolteacher!
Just wait here.
- Yes?
- I'm looking for Kim Hansen.
- I don't know anything about that.
- We had an appointment at 11 am.
I don't know anything about that,
I said.
- Mum?
- Come, lets unload. Come, Jonas.
Fuck you, you drunk fool!
Excuse me. Kim Hansen, is that you?
Yes.
I'm Liv.
We spoke in the phone this morning.
So you're coming tomorrow.
No, we agreed today at 12.
Kim Hansen.
Shall we... Then it's today.
- You are here now, you can say.
- Come, Jonas.
Haps!
Then it's here.
This is how it looks.
I can quickly get...
I can quickly move those things,
that needs to be moved so you can...
But I've changed...
No, I haven't...
I've just started that,
and then it's something else now.
But what I wanted to say, is...
I can just...
Ali Dogan.
Liv Beckmann Larsen.
Hi, I just left my husband,
so now I need a place to stay.
- You can try the crisis center...
- I'm not going to a crisis center.
I just need a place,
where I can live with my son.
Careful, man.
This is fuckin' good paint.
- How much do you want for the paint?
- At least 400.
I'll pay 200. Hold on.
- How much is in this one?
- Careful, it's good paint.
- And how many litres is in that one?
- There's ten.
So there is 15 litres of paint.
You can have 200.
200. I don't want to discuss it.
Hi, dad!
Do you know what it's worth?
Stig, will you buy it?
Yes, you fuckin' should.
Give it to him for 400.
Lars, stop it!
- Far, stop it!
- Lars, let me go!
Put down that bag!
- Relax.
- Yes, yes. I'm relaxed.
What the hell are you up to?
If it happens one time,
it'll keep on.
Smack her one!
You have no right to
smack anyone ever.
Kaj!
He's so fuckin' antisocial, man.
- So you're clearing out again.
- I'm working with him.
- See you, Connie.
- I'll come by to get the 200.
- That's expensive, isn't it?
- No, not for a football.
You can get some that are very expensive.
But then you can't take them out
in all kinds of weather.
- Was it one like that you wished for?
- Yes.
Kaj!
What the hell are you doing?!
You are destroying the flowers!
So, so, old man.
That's amazing.
Such amateurs they send.
- If the city doesn't son...
- No, Kaj. What the hell?
Will you stop that immediately!
Stop, I said!
I'll call the city!
I can promise you that!
I'll come after you.
- I won't put up with that.
- Kaj!
Kaj!
Here, Jonas.
Your lunch is in your lunchbox,
and there is milk and juice.
I'll be back in 5 hours.
I'll show you.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
When the big pointer is at 12,
and the small pointer is at 2, -
then I'm coming home, right?
The number for my work is there.
Else you just ask Kim, OK?
- Yes, I can manage.
- Your such a big boy.
Have a nice day, bye.
Hi, Jonas.
- Come on, Bo. Make some space.
- Don't touch me.
Stig, come over here.
Kaj, I just got a bill from
Nandrup of more than 2000 kroner.
- What will you do about that?
- I wouldn't fuckin' pay it.
I am so tired of you two, -
and I'm specially tired of
always having to discuss with you.
Go down and give Nandrup an apology,
then I'll withdraw the 2000 from your salary.
It's fuckin' him who should give
us an apology.
It's quite simple. Either you give
the man an apology, -
or you will be dismissed from
the Environment patrol.
- What the hell are we supposed to live from
then? - That can hardly be my problem.
You can't fuckin' get fired
from an activating-project.
Either you give that apology,
or it's out of here.
Kiss my ass, man.
What the hell are you standing there for?
Move your ass, man.
We should have ourselves
a real job.
Moron. Do you really think anyone
would hire somebody like you?
That's not what I mean.
We should be self-employed.
Then we'll make a goddamn catering firm.
Hell, You must fuckin' believe me.
I know a guy at the vegetable market.
A guy who works there.
There is day-old fruit and vegetables, -
that just lies.
Tomatoes and peppers just get thrown out.
That we can get for... nada!
Can you see it?
Stig, damn you,
I don't cook food anymore. It's over.
I fuckin' can't afford
them withdrawing my welfare.
Connie goes completely bananas, man.
She'll freak out, Kaj.
Hi.
I can't get in.
My shark fell out,
and now the door is latched.
- Isn't there anyone up there?
- Kim, but he don't bother to open.
- Where is your mother?
- She's working.
Do you know when she comes back?
When the big pointer shows 12,
and the small pointer shows 2.
Then you'll have to sit here
until your mum comes back, right?
Yes, Hi. It's Liv.
Yes, long time since.
I wondered if you know somebody
who can look after Jonas?
Okay, be well. Bye bye.
He's a lovely boy... Jonas.
I can see that right away.
Yes, he is.
And that I will tell you, Liv.
You are a lovely...
It's a lovely way
you handle him... in fact.
And that is important.
You need to take care. There's
some subjects out here, that's a little...
And a girl like you...
Well, what my point is...
- Keep an eye...
- Thanks, Kim. I will.
- I just got us 500 kroner.
- What have you?
The new girl with the kid
needs to have some furniture moved.
What are you talking about? Why do
you think she wants us to help?
We get half a grand for it.
That's because she's fuckin' afraid
of getting beaten up.
- What has it got to do with us?
- Well, I am not going out to fight!
- We'll just take Bo along.
- No way.
Kaj, it's 500 kroner!
Let's see, Bo.
Here is 40 for diesel.
- And then the 200, you owe me.
- Shit, I forgot that.
Stig, damn you.
- You could give a helping hand, Bo.
- I'm the driver.
If you put it there, it's fine.
- Where do you want the rest?
- Just put it there.
That was pretty fast.
Here you go.
No, because right now
I'm in the middle of...
Well, cheers and thanks for the help.
Well, but then...
Could I make one of you
look after Jonas - just tomorrow?
There is not really any one of
us who is a pedagogue.
I'll pay.
That we can certainly work out.
That's no problem.
- Would you do that?
- Clearly.
- That's really sweet of you.
- Don't worry about that.
Come on, Jonas. Shoot.
Ouch, my goodness.
No, Jonas, I can't anymore.
Now you goddamn take over.
You must be crazy.
I won't nurse children.
No, but...
- Are you getting old, Stig?
- Okay. Then we take a calm game.
We shoot to each other.
Ouch, for the devil!
Come on. Stig.
Come in.
- Is he sleeping?
- Yes.
- Do you want a glass of wine?
- No thanks.
- Not tonight, I'm a little tired.
- A little tired, Yes.
I already have... opened up.
You don't have to drink anything.
- It's more just to say "Cheers".
- Okay.
I am Soeren Kierkegaard...
I mean, it's him,
I write about. as dissertation.
But that, many before
me, have done.
If you take Michael Strunge...
In fact I have a script
lying around.
- About Kierkegaard?
- No.
There is an...
Olesen-Larsen who has achieved
a special reading of Kierkegaard, -
which demonstrates a modernity,
which is striking for its time.
And not to forget... It's that, that...
Kim, what is this?
Well... that is that we have a pleasant time
and say welcome.
I think it works quite well.
And I'm very happy that you
moved in. Cheers and welcome.
Cheers. Thanks.
Come on, Denmark! Come on, Jonas!
- There is goal post.
- 1 - 0!
- What the hell. That's a changer.
- I'm just a goalkeeper.
- Peter Laudrup.
- You are Peter Laudrup?
- Master tackling. Go on.
- There must be something, referee.
- There is penalty.
- It was clean.
- Stop it, you pussy.
- He takes...
- No, he doesn't. Did you?
- No.
You see.
Have you had a party?
- You could say that.
- Was it because you had birthday?
Come, sit here.
Then he wanted to climb trees.
Before we knew it,
he was all the way to the top.
He is bold. He doesn't grumble.
- Can you write it?
- Kaj, it's already 900 kroner.
- Haven't you had your welfare?
- No, they made a mistake.
I'll call them.
- Be well, Ali.
- Same to you.
Do you know which car is the
ugliest ever made?
- Suzuki Wagon. It's so fuckin' ugly.
- Yes, it's the little one.
It should be forbidden
to make such an ugly car.
Mercedes, that's a car.
I'll buy a Mercedes.
I'll go to Germany to buy it.
So you'll buy it down there.
You must buy it south of Frankfurt.
There they don't use salt on the roads.
What are you talking about?
An old Mercedes,
that has run 250.000 kilometers.
- It's almost as new.
- How the hell will you pay for that?
It doesn't matter right now.
Then you'll buy it for 3.000 D-mark.
You can't even afford a bus-card,
and then you talk about buying a car.
Connie's brother-in-law has one. It's not
an idea I get out of thin air.
He must have had some money then.
Stig, you are dreaming!
The standard down there
is air condition and leather seats.
- Ouch, hell...
- What the hell is wrong, Kaj?
- What the hell is wrong, Kaj?
- Get my pills.
Which ones of them is it?
- Should I call an ambulance?
- No, it's over in a little while.
God damn, Kaj.
No, Stig!
Stig!
Mum!
- Hi.
- Hi, mum.
- Dad, hi!
- Jonas.
Lars, that is Stig and Kaj.
They are taking care of Jonas.
They don't need to do that.
He can get in a kindergarten.
- Don't you want to get in a kindergarten?
- Yes.
- I bought you something.
- Here you go.
- Just say when, if there's anything.
- That's fine.
- Are you coming, Liv?
- Se you.
Yes, it's Liv.
Hello?
Anybody there?
Lars, is it you?
- Jump then.
- No, Jonas.
It smells great.
Yes. This is then Kaj's Corner.
Everything out here
looks the same.
It looks delicious, really.
- Can you guess where you are to sit?
- There, cause it says Jonas.
Yes, that's exactly right.
Lars knew one who had worked
in the restaurant, and then I got the job.
It wasn't exactly
what I had in mind, -
but now I can provide
for me and Jonas.
Then we just need a place to live.
You can't keep living with the lunatic.
Don't you know someone else?
It's just a little difficult,
cause all my friends live in Aarhus.
All my old friends live in Aarhus.
You must not live out here.
It's the asshole of the earth, Liv.
- Mum, I want ice cream.
- You shall not have ice cream.
You are going on treasure hunt with me.
- Is it a real treasure?
- Yes, of course.
Mum, won't you come along?
- Are you a sissy?
- No.
- Then we don't want to have girls come
along. - I'll make coffee meanwhile.
Bring your clothes.
It's dark and cold there.
Liv, why don't you take a look at this,
while we are gone.
What's that?
Just some old photos I think
you should see.
Come on sailor, lets ride.
Quiet. Careful. What does it say?
- "Hi, Jonas".
- It certainly does.
Try to take that away.
Then this must be for you.
Wow, a bike!
It's a bike.
Mum, look! It was a new bike.
That was lucky for you, Jonas.
Now we'll have ice cream!
It was really sweet of you.
The one at home is way too small.
- Isn't it true, Jonas?
- Yes.
Will you take the cups?
Ice cream is served.
- Liv...
- I forgot the milk.
We also brought chocolate,
right, Jonas?
Where the hell is it?
- Jonas, have you taken...
- Never mind.
Liv!
Mum, where are you going?
Liv? That wasn't my intention...
Who the hell do you think you are
indulge yourself with my son!
You have known it all along,
and you didn't say shit!
- I just said it.
- You haven't said shit!
You put an old box
with letters in my hand.
It doesn't matter.
Now you know.
You can't even look me in the eyes,
when you will tell that you are my father!
You haven't let hear from you
for nineteen years!
How do you think I feel?
I couldn't have a child!
You knew, I stood alone, 14 years old,
with my mothers funeral.
- Not even then could you be there!
- I can't be a father to anyone!
No, the hell you can't.
come, Jonas.
But, mum.
- I want my bike!
- Jonas, not now.
I want my bike.
I want my bike.
My bike!
Jonas, I'll be right back.
For my sake you can drink yourself to death!
Just stay far away from us!
That's fine. If you think.
You have never grasped a shit!
You are so fucking cold-assed!
It's your-fuckin'-self,
who wants it like that!
Didn't she say,
why we shouldn't look after him?
Kaj, damn you, I have 200 kroner.
I don't know what to do.
- Bo was about to knock me down yesterday.
- Shut up, Stig.
We damn well have to go down
and give the old guy an apology.
You are so fuckin' stupid, man.
Have you no pride at all?!
If they say run, you run!
If they say stand, you stand!
If they say sit,
You fuckin' sit down!
You are so fuckin' stupid, Stig!
You are not a human!
You are a dog! Vuf!
- Kaj?
- Get lost, moron!
Mum?
Mum. I want to go home.
- Mum.
- Could we have coffee please?
- Mum!
- Two seconds.
- White wine, Club Soda and coffee.
- Lars just called again.
Thanks.
- Mum.
- Jonas, two seconds.
- Excuse me one moment. Come, Jonas.
- Could we have that coffee please?
Stop it, Jonas!
- Jonas, please stop!
- I wanna go home to dad.
- Not right now, Kim.
- No. don't you want a glass of wine?
- Not right now.
- There is something you must see.
- If you would be so kind.
- I don't.
No, that's obvious. If you just...
But I don't just!
Get out now, Kim!
- Kim, stop it.
- You must just...
Wouldn't you like to sit down?
I have something you must see.
- Mum!
- Sit down please!
- Then I have a gift for you.
- No.
- I am not...
- But it's for you.
It fits your finger well.
It's you who are the one.
When I finish my dissertation,
we can get married.
- Kim, we are not getting married!
- I love you.
- But we are not getting married.
- I love you!
I hear very well!
I can hear what you say.
No, you don't like me. Sorry.
Sorry too then...
It's all wrong.
- It's damn good for you.
- I got it on bargain.
You look like a whore,
I once fucked in Spain.
- Why do you never say anything nice?
- I remember she gave me the crabs.
Don't sit there and
pour your vomit over me.
They tried to sell her,
as if she was a virgin.
With the crabs.
There we have the little doggie, who
has been wagging the tail for the captain.
- Good little doggie.
- He's so fucking provocative.
Vuf, uf, vuf.
Now you'll goddamn fucking stop, Kaj.
Go to hell
with the bad vibes.
You are goddamn dogs all of you.
Fuckin' pekineses, man!
What did you say?
- Fuck off, Kaj!
- Do you know what I said? Shut up, man.
You are a big, empty-headed,
well-performing poodle.
What the hell are you doing, Bo?
This is too fucking much, this.
Just come on, you stupid, big...
Stig, man. Do something.
Are you finished now?
Now you'll goddamn stop it, Kaj.
Do you want some beating, you big...
Stop it, goddamn!
You go berserk on him, man!
Stig, come on.
- Get up, Kaj.
- Go to hell!
- Can I help you with something?
- Bug off, man.
- Hi, we are on the way home.
- I would like to talk to dad.
No, don't come.
I'll call you later, okay.
- I would also talk to dad.
- We'll call him later.
Stupid mum.
Can't you make him control himself?
He has been playing like that since morning.
Yes, of course.
Kim!
- Kim, goddamn it.
- Mum, he's in the toilet.
...not at least you must relate
the systems of sight...
Whether it was a coincidence that
our eyes met after the sentence.
I doubt.
And then she is a bashing blonde.
Further there has been too many
incidents/coincidents.
Fairness and honesty
is something I appreciate.
Go away!
Go away from here!
Go away! Go away!
Then you can start all over!
All over!
Kim, no!
When it gets so far, that a person
can become master of the sleep, -
- the physical and psychic side
of the part itself, -
then it can become a question of
the coordinating betrays coordinates!
No, Kim!
When others make themselves master of
the physical and psychic part of the sleep!
Yes, hi. It's Liv.
Is it fair?!
Everything has gone shitty.
Will you please come and pick us up?
I simply don't know what to do.
Is it honesty?!
Is it fairness?!
Come.
- Tarzan. You haven't got a beer, do you?
- You bet I have.
Here.
- Have you got any money I can borrow?
- I'm completely broke.
Completely.
- Is he happy to come home?
- Yes, he really missed it.
It's good to have you both home again.
- Aren't you happy to be home?
- Yes, I'm just a little tired.
I think you need a holiday.
Shouldn't we pack the car
and go to southern France?
It would also be
good for Jonas.
Eat orderly.
I fucking want to know who it is!
There isn't anybody! Relax!
Don't tell me to relax!
And don't humiliate me
in front of my son!
There is something! I know there is!
- Hell!
- Lars, stop!
...and Everhappy got wet toes,
and therefore she was knocking -
on the snails tiny roof.
Therefore Søren shouted loud: "Come in
to shelter for thunder, rain and wind."
Badr!
- Yes?
- Hi. Is it you?
Yes.
Kaj, are you there?
Yes, goddamn it.
It's Liv.
What do you want?
I'm lying in the hospital. Bispebjerg.
You have to pick up Jonas.
There is nobody else I can call.
Goddamn...
- Who are you looking for?
- Liv Beckmann Larsen.
- Who are you?
- Kaj Beckmann Larsen.
- Are you the boys father?
- I'm his...
I'm her...
She has goddamn
called me herself.
She is going to X-ray now,
but we can't get the boy away from her.
There is visit.
- Hi, Kaj.
- Hallo, Yo.
Will you be nice
and take Jonas out for a moment?
- Come, Jonas.
- No.
You can do it.
- I'm coming out.
- We'll go out and find some sweet.
- No, I wanna be with my mum.
- Kom nu, sailor.
Just a minute,
then you can come in again, right?
Have you turned him in?
I can't.
Then he'll have nothing.
Turn him in and move back to Aarhus.
There is two things I remember
from the time you lived with us.
When Jolly died, you gave me comfort
and said we should put him in the garden.
Then an angel would come at night
and bring him to the end of the world.
And there it would wait for us
until we came.
Then we would be together again.
You and me and mum and Jolly.
And everything would be so good.
And next morning it was gone.
And you know what?
For many years I actually believed
we would meet at the end of the world.
The next I remember is, -
- that you were kicking mum
and pulling her arms, -
and she has to say sorry.
She can't say anything at all.
She's screaming,
and you just keep on kicking.
And the more you kick,
the more she screams.
And that scream has burnt in me.
Jonas is not going back to Lars.
Will...
Will you take care of him,
until I get out of here?
- Of course.
- Will you?
What are we doing now?
Now we go home to me.
We have to do something.
Maybe he's dead.
- Then let him die alone.
- You don't mean that.
You can fuckin' believe I do.
That's peoples own matter.
- He's fucking not dead.
- You don't know that.
The old guy down at Carstens
they didn't find until he was rotting.
- Connie, give me 100 kroner.
- Why?
Give me 100 kroner, Connie.
What do you need them for?
Stig, man.
Then we won't have dinner tonight.
Shut up, Connie!
That is goddamn unimportant with food.
You stay here.
- Where is my wife?
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You know damn well?
- Who the hell do you think you are?
I just want to know where my wife is.
You know where she is. Tell me now.
Come on. I'm asking you something.
Are you listening?
I want my wife.
She will never come back to you,
you coward.
You'll be allowed to sit and
rot in your own vomit.
- Who is it, Kaj?
- Jonas, stay out there.
- What the hell are you doing, man?!
- Jonas, run.
Jonas, run now!
Open god damn it!
Hell!
Ouch, damn it!
For the devil and hell...
Hey!
Where are we going?
I want to go to mum.
Your mum is in the hospital.
- Where have you been?
- I want to go to my dad.
What the hell is going on?
- I want to go home to my dad!
- Jonas, stop it now!
You are stupid!
I want to go home to my dad!
Your dad has just beaten
your mum half to death, -
so he is surely the last one
you are going to. I that understood?
Are you afraid?
No, I'm just thinking.
- What do we do now?
- Now we walk around for a while.
Then we go home again.
Train to Copenhagen Airport
in Kastrup from track 6.
- I'm thirsty.
- You'll just have to wait a little.
I have to go to the toilet.
Just stay right here,
then I'll be right back.
InterCity from Soenderborg
11:48 from track 1.
What the hell are you doing?
Stop doing that.
You come along.
Kaj?
Have you seen someone named Kaj?
I don't know.
How does Kaj look?
He is such a guy with jeans,
then he has wrinkles and smell of beer.
Have you no idea,
where he went?
- He said, he went to the toilet.
- Then we better check if he's there.
Is there anyone here named Kaj?
Nope. I'm afraid he's not here.
You haven't seen a little boy
with blond hair?
I would like to advertise for a boy
who's name is Jonas.
He's approximately this high.
We bring an announcement.
It's concerning
Jonas Beckmann Larsen, -
that has been lost.
Jonas is wearing a green jacket.
Hi, Jonas.
You lied.
You wasn't at the toilet at all.
I'm very sorry.
I found this.
Then she brings them home,
and it shows out, -
that all of her house
is built of candy.
Mars bars and pancakes and winegum, -
then she lets them into the house,
and she slams the door...
It's the Police. Open the door.
Jonas, stay here.
It's the Police. Open the door.
I know he's in there.
- Who is it?
- Sscch!
- Who is it?
- Quiet, Jonas.
Jonas, you need to put this on.
We are leaving.
Come.
Come, Jonas.
- Are you holding tight, Kaj?
- You need to get down and stand here.
Come on, Jonas.
Hold very tight.
Don't worry, we don't do anything.
We just need to get through.
There are some criminals with
pistols outside our door.
I need to pee.
- Now?
- Yes. I need to pee now.
Then go out here.
Hello? This is the Police.
Jonas! Come!
What's happening? He probably flees.
- Have you seen Stig?
- No. He's at home I guess.
- Yes?
- It's Kaj.
Stig. I need a place to stay
with Jonas for some days.
Stig, god damn it.
I'm damn sorry of that, -
I said about,
you being a dog, right?
- Yes, cause I'm no dog, Kaj.
- No.
It may be that I fetch beers,
but I'm not a dog.
You are so fucking negative.
Why don't you just take your own life?
You don't want anything. You think,
that everything is pissing indifferent.
Why don't you hang yourself,
and give the rest of us peace?
Stig.
If you don't help me,
I don't know what to do.
There is Police in the whole area. People
think you want to kill the fucking kid.
- Who says that?
- The Police.
- Bo had seen you go over here. - He hasn't
got too many lights in the cookie.
- Kaj can't beat a fly out of course.
- That we may just explain the Police.
I have promised not to deliver Jonas
to others than Liv.
Climb up there.
This way.
Here is shelter.
What do you think, Jonas?
Don't you think it will be cozy?
You haven't tried this before, have you?
Then we'll just make a bed for you.
Stig. You have to get in touch with Liv.
She's in Bispebjerg hospital.
Stig!
Thanks.
So.
Goodnight, Kaj.
You can sleep now, Jonas.
Stay right there.
Then it's this one...
- Mum!
- Hi, Jonas.
- Hi, honey.
- What the hell are you doing, Kaj?
I can't feel my fucking legs.
Shit, Kaj. Where are your pills?
He can't fuckin' breathe.
- Call an ambulance, Stig.
- He need his pills.
- He need... Where are they?
- You call an ambulance now!
He just need his fuckin' pills.
Yes, hello. It's Stig Jakobsen.
I need an ambulance.
Boegevej number 110.
- No, Boegevej.
- We just need to get order in this mess.
You can just live in my flat, then...
- I'll just find something.
- It's okay. We are moving to Aarhus.
He has such... cramps.
What the hell shall I call it?
What then, if this jerk finds you?
It's over. I have turned him in, Kaj.
Yes, and it was Stig Jakobsen.
That's fine.
I...
The ambulance will be here shortly.
I'll just go down and get them.
Come, Jonas. We also go down.
- Must Kaj stay up there?
- Yes.
But just until tonight. Then an
angel comes and picks him up -
and takes him to the end of the world.
And there he will wait for us,
until once we also come.
And then we will all
be together again.
