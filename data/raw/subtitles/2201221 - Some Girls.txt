Hi there.
Hi.
Hey. Hi.
Hey.
So, this is pretty nice.
Oh, uhh...
I've never been here before.
No? Uhh, yeah, they're good.
They're good. They got 'em
all over the place now.
I guess why would I, right?
Live in town,
how often are you going to
stay at a local hotel, right?
No, it's true.
I mean, unless...
What? Unless what?
You know.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
You know what I'm saying.
No, I don't, truthfully. What?
Unless you were
seeing someone illicitly.
Oh. Right, that.
Yes, that.
Uhh, do you want anything?
Like a, uhh, water or something?
No, I'm fine.
Might have some nuts,
if that's all right with you,
cashews.
Go for it.
Even though they're, like,
$600.
Geez, not even salted,
I'm not big on that.
Oh.
I... I read that thing you did
for that one magazine.
It... Someone emailed it to me.
It was pretty good.
It's funny how much
you know about women now.
Anyway...
Anyway, so, yeah,
uhh, I know this is sort of
out of the blue and all.
And I just, uhh...
Look, I needed to see you.
Why is that?
I only cut to the chase
because, you know,
my kids get home at 3:00.
Oh, right, sure. Sorry.
Okay, umm...
I'm going to get some water,
actually.
These really do parch your
throat after you eat a few.
Listen,
you're probably wondering
what I'm even doing back here,
back in the, umm, Seattle area.
It did cross my mind, yes.
Right, sure.
Of course,
although I do get back here
every couple of years or so,
to see my folks,
that sort of thing.
Oh, they're still in town?
Yep.
But I am... I'm not here
for that, to see them.
No?
No.
I'm here, uhh,
because I just want to
do something here,
uhh, right a wrong or whatnot,
make... make things okay.
Huh. All right.
Does that make sense?
Umm, not really.
Well, what I mean is, umm,
we had a really nice
go of it back then.
High school.
Yes, yes, school, uhh,
great times back at
Central Valley,
and a lot of fun.
And then we sort of...
Well, you ended it.
Uh-huh, right.
You broke up with me.
Yes, I did. That's true.
Was there something else
you wanted to go over?
Are you mad at me?
(Laughing)
Seriously though, are you?
I can't believe you'd say that.
Well, I don't know. You can
carry stuff like that around.
You'd be surprised.
No, I wouldn't.
Uh-uh, I would not
because I do think about it,
what happened between us.
Good. Let's talk about it.
Now?
Yeah. I mean,
I know you got to go.
But we could at least
air a bit of laundry,
or however that saying goes.
You want to air this stuff now?
Yeah, only if it's okay.
Instead of 15 years ago?
You flew here to do this today?
Yes, I know it
seems strange but...
Okay, fine, good. Go for it.
Okay.
You are angry.
Maybe just a touch, yep.
Okay, all right, Sam, I'm going
to be open with you here,
totally upfront, honest.
I think the reason
that we broke up back then...
There was no "We". It was you.
You ended it.
I know. I know that.
I do know it.
But it wasn't any one thing
that prompted it. It wasn't.
And... And...
For some reason,
I always had the idea that
you thought you'd done
something wrong, something...
No. I... No.
Okay, good, 'cause I just
wanted you to know...
as in better late than never...
that it just,
it wasn't anything of the sort.
I know. I know that.
Why would I think that?
I didn't.
Okay, then I am just reiterating
for you, albeit a bit late
in the game,
that you did nothing wrong.
Great. Fine. Good.
It was me. I needed to...
Okay.
Tell me. What did you need?
Felt like, at the time,
I wanted to have my freedom
or maybe do the college thing
somewhere other than
over at community,
and, uhh, maybe pursue
my writing stuff, whatever.
And you were a girl that
I could sort of look at,
you know, uhh,
take a glance at and
maybe see her whole future.
Really?
A bit, yeah. And that's not a
bad thing or anything. It's not.
I just think,
if I can say this...
Oh, go for it. You're on a roll.
History has proven me right.
It has.
I mean, you ended up pretty much
like I figured you would.
Oh, really? Have I now?
Well, kind of, I mean,
with your husband doing
what I would have guessed
he'd be doing.
Any, you know, back then,
when I'm just
this scared teenager
staring eternity in the face,
I could see myself with that
produce manager's vest on.
And, you know,
I suppose I got nervous.
And I backed out of
the situation
the best way I knew how.
He's not the produce manager.
He runs the store,
the whole store.
Oh. All right.
He's the store manager.
There's a difference.
Granted. Sorry.
Forget it.
Is it... I mean, is it time
for the kids or...
You're not mad, are you?
No, fine.
'Cause I didn't want to...
No. I said I'm fine, so just...
I believed you.
So, why don't you just
go ahead and believe me?
All right, yeah, fine.
Okay, fine. Take care.
Good to see you, I guess.
And that's it?
That's the whole reason
why we suddenly ended like that?
Because you had a vision
of spending your life
working in some Safeway?
Pretty much, yeah. I mean...
Not some other girl?
No. I mean, I don't...
I don't recall anybody else.
No, you don't?
Uh-uh.
Okay, 'cause I always had this
vague, you know, worry about
that back then, back whenever.
No.
We were going out for, like...
Two years, a little more.
And you never went to prom
with anyone else, right?
No, I even worked that night,
on prom night,
after we broke up,
it was during...
You, you broke it off.
Why can't you just say that?
Oh, I don't even want to be
thinking about this shit,
not at all. I don't. I'm...
I'm a mother now. I'm...
I'm a wife and a mother.
And this is all like
Ancient Greek history.
Why did you have to
call me about this?
Why... Why would you
do this to me?
I wanted to, I don't know,
to just make sure
that we were okay.
Yes, we are okay. We are a-okay.
Is that what you needed?
Is that... Is that enough
for you to go back
to your something special
life in...
Uhh, where...
Where was it again?
New York.
I have a place in Chelsea.
But I teach at... Doesn't matter.
It's all New York City.
I wasn't talking about our prom.
The one I was referring to
was the one at North Central,
that prom.
Oh, okay.
So, did you go there
with someone to that prom?
Not that I... I mean,
this is, like, 15 years ago.
Please.
No, I did not ask anyone
to that prom. I didn't.
Okay. That's not what I heard,
but okay.
I... I think there was,
uhh, some girl,
some senior friend
of, uhh...
Remember that guy I knew from,
like, kindergarten, Tim?
Somebody?
Anyways, him, and he did,
he asked me to, uhh, just drop
in, really just stop over
with this one girl
who was his date's friend,
some tall girl,
played volleyball.
See, now this is what I heard.
Nothing else, no.
We didn't even do pictures or,
like, a corsage or anything.
It was not at all like that.
It was, like, more like a, uhh,
you know,
whatever you call it.
I don't know. I'm dying to hear.
Uhh, a chaperone.
It was more that, really.
Her chaperone?
Yeah, basically.
Okay, she was a senior.
I mean, you were a senior.
And she was a senior.
You know when your brother
takes you to something,
like a company...
Listen. I left here there.
I didn't even drive her home.
I thought we even talked about
this once, over the summer.
No, we did not...
Before...
Not ever. We talked about
getting engaged, but not this.
Oh. Okay, my mistake.
Yeah, apparently so.
And, no, I...
I overheard it once,
just a mention of it,
one time, in the store.
You know, the store you almost
ended up at in your vision.
I was in there,
dropping off a lunch
for my husband.
And I was looking at...
I don't remember what now,
some new endcap display,
cookies or whatever.
And I hear a voice,
this voice that I recognize,
this blast from the past.
It is your mother, your mom,
standing in the juice aisle,
talking to some woman,
some neighbourhood lady
or from church.
And they are going on about the
good old days like ladies do.
And, somehow, they get
on the subject of prom
came up.
So, off they go
about this and that and...
I didn't mean to.
I just kept standing there
and listening.
And, boy, did I get an earful
about you and us and lots...
lots of stuff.
And part of that stuff
was about how nice you looked,
how well you cleaned up, as she
called it, for your big night,
prom night.
So, imagine me standing next
to the Hearty Fudge Crunch,
thinking "What night?
I didn't have a big night.
We didn't go to prom."
But of course, she wasn't
talking about me or us.
She was talking about you.
The night she was referring to
was all about you and her,
some girl.
Yeah.
I got to go.
Look, it's good to see you,
honestly.
Yep, take care.
Okay, and if you want to...
What?
Nothing. I was going to say if
you'd like an email address or...
Do you tweet?

That suddenly felt overdue,
couldn't help myself so...
No, that's all right.
I mean, I...
I'm just watching the news.
What page is she on, all right?
Huh? What do you mean?
In the yearbook,
in the North Central yearbook.
I don't... I mean... Why?
Just because. My husband was
a Titan. So, I have his.
He graduated from there?
Yes.
What page is she?
I mean, I'm not even...
Just tell me, please.
Near the back, I think,
last name was Tate, maybe.
Fine. Thank you.
Bye. Oh, hey.
Did I mention
I'm getting married?
Uhh, no. You...
You didn't.
Well, I am. I'm getting, uhh...

the same year.
Mm-hmm.
I just got to say though,
you just never struck me as the,
you know,
type.
Well, I think I was a bit
different when I was here,
unfocussed. I don't really think
I was at my best in Chicago.
I'll bet she's hot,
if I know you.
Umm, yeah, you know, yes,
a very attractive woman,
uhh, I mean,
quite pretty like you or...
She dark?
Excuse me.
Colouring, I mean.
You always seemed
to go for the brunettes, mostly,
a redhead or two,
but mostly dark.
Uhh, no. Actually, she's blonde.
Well, highlights.
"Blonde", huh?
A little change.
An appetite for adventure,
I'd say.
Uhh, I don't know about that.
Come on.
You totally did, always had
an eye for the toys and whatnot.
Remember?
You even wanted me to try
one of those, uhh, strap-ons.

Excuse me?

Yeah, but
I need to display
some fidelity here.
You sound really thrilled
about it.
Shut up. I am.
Yeah.
I can tell.
Come on, seriously.
No, this is very hard.
What? This?
Hey, Tyler, honestly, don't.
You shouldn't do that.
I know I shouldn't,
completely aware of that.
But I hardly ever do it
when I'm supposed to.
That's why my friends have
a bunch of kids. And I have fun.
Don't you like fun?
Of course. Sure I do, yes.
Hey, come on.
I've sort of taken
this vow thing here.
I need to stick to it.
I see. Okay.
What you're saying is you want

Right.
I don't want to let her down.
Even if it just happens here
with nobody the wiser?
I think so, yes.
Can I smoke in here?
Uhh, yeah, I think.
It's a smoking room.

Isn't that funny?
Yeah, I guess.
It is to me.
I mean, no offence,
but you weren't, like,
this amazing person or anything.
Oh.
You were just this dude.
We spent however long together.
And yet, I think about you.
Okay, see, and that was, uhh,
a part of the deal here,
why I got a hold of you.
Uhh, I just wanted to see
if we could talk.
Absolutely.
Great, okay.
So, uhh...
This ought to be good.
Yeah, let's hope, right?
Umm, here's the deal.
Do I want to hear this?
Sure, it's no big.
What I've done is
start to travel around a bit
here and there
and, umm, stop in on
a few old girlfriends...
Okay.
Uhh, do a check-in, you know,
get caught up to date with them
and make sure we are, uhh,
you know, no harm, no foul.
How many?
What?
I'm saying how many little stops
are you making?
You can round it off
if you want to.
Uhh, just...
just three for right now,
maybe four. It's expensive.
So, I'm just doing the, umm,
pulse work on everybody's
schedule and all that, so...
Huh.
Interesting.
Figured it would be a good way
to start my new life, this whole
thing I'm about to embark on.
It's not a cruise.
True, "Embark"
probably not the exact word
I'm looking for.
What are you looking for?
I don't know, some other word.
No, I mean by doing this.
What are you trying to do here?
Hell, I don't know,
right a wrong or whatever.
I just...
It's just this general sense of
this that keeps gnawing at me,
a kind of faint memory
of hurting, of me hurting,
or being hurt. I don't know.
No. I... I don't... Nope.
Good.
That's good because I do feel it
in a strange way.
I don't know how to
articulate it. But it's there.
That's the deal when
you're a writer, I guess.
Doesn't matter
how much it stings
or how painful it is for
the other people in your life,
you just can't let shit go.
You got to turn it over,
study it, poke it, you know?
Sell it?
No. I mean, not always, no.
Well, yeah, at times,
some scrap of life might
find its way into a story.
And that may get sold.
But, hey...
Anyway, no.
It was nothing like that.
I mean, unless you
did something
to me in my sleep or...
What's that mean? I...
I'm only joking around.
Okay. God.
Must be nerves.
Shit. Hope she's worth it,
this fiancée person.
I think so, yes.
Hmm. You think? Or you know?
Well, that's just it.
I don't know.
With you, it just feels...
Oh, forget it.
No, go ahead. I can take it.
Well, I'm sorry if
this hurts you at all.
But I'm not so sure my being
here is about us or anything,
I mean, the relationship
I had with you.
This hurt thing I mentioned
a minute ago
that I was just
talking about is...
Oh, God.
You know what.
What?
I think it's about her.
Who? "Her" who?
Umm, nothing, no one, some girl,
this person before you,
the girl I left for you.
See, I think I came here feeling
like I did something to you,
all this hurt stuff. But it's
really her I'm thinking about.
I think I felt so shitty about
what I did to her by leaving
that I... I plunged in
with you physically.
But that whole time,
I was really feeling...
I don't know, something bad,
I guess,
about her. Wow.
I suck.
Well, that answers that.
What?
I wasn't always stoned.
There were lots of phone calls
you made
in the first few months,
I mean, lots.
I'd catch you doing it sometimes
right after you hung up.
And you would make up
this elaborate lies about it.
But I knew
what you were doing. Look.
It's never cool to be second
in a relationship, you know?
It's not. And I was
a distant second for a bit.
But then you started
coming around.
So, what the hell, just go on
and let things happen.
It's fine.
But, yeah, I think you're right.
That shit hurts.

This is the part where you say

That's how it works. That's why

Right.
It's fun to be back here,
in our old room,
427.
Uh-huh, that's true.
Lots of memories, lots.
Yes, you're right about that.
I do have a number of memories
about this room, this place.
And some of them didn't even
end up in your article.
It's astonishing to me
how vampiric you people are,
how cannibalistic, writers, God.
It's just fiction, Lindsay.
Well, whatever lets you
sleep at night.
It was...
What was the name of it again?
"The Calculus of Desire".
Oh, right, nice, lyrical.
And is there anything new out
there that I should be aware of?
Uhh, no. But I'm...
Hey, well,
the movie rights just sold.
Oh, goody.
I do remember this fondly
though, being here.
Me too.
I never even liked Boston
until I met you.
Really? That's a shame.
At the time, just out of school
and at my first teaching gig,
I was...
Lost? That's what you
used to say to me.
You were lost.
I was.
I think I was too young.
That was part of it anyhow.
I was just way too young to be
teaching some grad Lit course.
I was a year younger than you
when I started here,
with a dissertation to finish.
But still, can you imagine that?
No, it's wild.
Well, it was a different time,
yes, a different era at least.
We all cared a bit more.
We were all a bit more committed
or something.
That's what they say, the '70s.
I started in the '80s,
in the late '80s.
Oh. Sorry.
'89.
Right.
Doesn't matter. It has nothing
to do with this, actually.
I'm just going on here because...
Why are we here?
Because of this wedding?
Yeah, and, uhh,
anyhow, I felt the need.
Well, that's nice, I suppose.
It's lovely to know that
our time with one another
meant something more to you than
paycheque from a publisher.
It is that...
Listen. I know you have
no reason to trust me here.
It's certainly been
a while but...
Well, that's...
That's part of this.
That's part of
the confusing side.
You called me at work, my work.
My point is
you didn't need to do that.
You're getting married.
I'm still married.
I know. Believe me. I know.
Well, then why do it?
After everything that happened,
all we went through,
why risk that? Huh?
Why do that to me?
I don't know. I'm sorry.
I thought that...
He still works there, right?
Yes, of course. He's...
He's the dean now.
Right, and, you know,
I thought I might
run into him or whatever,
sort of see him in the hallway,
make a scene.
And I didn't want that for you.
You left at the end of
that second semester.
So, you...
You probably have no idea,
no real sense of
how hard things were for me
back there for a while,
after we were spotted.
Not really, no.
You never called to check,
not once, not one single time.
True enough.
I did ring you a coup...
But I would always hang up
before, so, yeah, yeah.
We got caught.
And you
ran off,
leaving me behind.
I did do that, Lindsay.
I'm very sorry.
And that's kind of why I'm here,
back in the area,
before I go off and get
all married myself.
To become the jealous husband?
The cuckold?
Well, I hope not, but yeah, yes.
I deserve that.
(Clearing throat)
Can I get a drink of something?
Of course, sure. Geez, I'm an
idiot for not, uhh...
Water? Is that...
Yeah, fine.
It's Fiji. Is that all right?
I have nothing against Fiji.
Well, not the islands, anyway.
(Chuckling)
I'm glad you came.
Me too. It's important.
Yep. I agree.
No, I... I don't mean for us:
for him.
Who?
For my husband.
It's an awfully big step,
his letting me come here.
I don't follow.
He urged me to see you.
He's waiting downstairs for me.
Huh?
Sitting out front in our Subaru.
Oh, shit.
Yes, he really wanted me
to do this.
He felt that I needed to.
So, you told him what?
Everything,
about you contacting me,
about you wanting
to meet me here.
You did?
Yes. Well, he already knew
about before.
Wow. May I ask why?
Not really,
not if you're asking me
if you have the right to ask.
Then I'd say no, you don't.
You lost most of your rights
with me when you took off.
And you lost the rest of them
when you wrote about it.
Whereas he stuck with me.
He stayed in a relationship
that I had completely
and totally betrayed
with a man that he had hired,
given a job to.
I know that.
The big question now is
why are you here?
So that I can say that I'm...
You know, to let you know
that I am sorry.
Oh. Okay, fine.
Well, why don't you
go down to the car
and tell him that?
I don't... probably not prepared
to do that at this time.
No, I didn't imagine
that you would be.
It's not why he came, anyway.
No?
No. He came to support me.
I think older men are
very giving in that way.
Yes. He's quite special.
God, that probably sounds really
bad coming out of my mouth,
doesn't it?
Pretty much, yes.
I could tell as I was saying it.
Well, at least you felt it.
That's something.
Now, what exactly,
if you don't mind,
are you sorry for?
For all the... What you said,
for running off...
And I did get another job
so it was not
technically running... but
took off when things came out.
So, not for doing it? Not that?
Uhh, no. I mean, yes, that was
probably wrong too but...
So, mostly, you're just sorry
for us getting caught?
Being found out?
Overall, mostly that,
and for the
leaving you hanging part too.
I see.
I never meant for anyone
to get hurt by it.
That was not my intention.
Very rarely
is that the intention
behind an affair.
But it's almost always
the result:
hurt, someone being hurt.
Yeah, I think I've...
Okay, listen.
Maybe we should just...
Oh, you want to get going,
right?
That's your M.O., isn't it?
When the going gets tough...
Tough get going, right?
No, I was going to say "Run away
and hide like a bloody child."
Listen, Lindsay.
I know you have
every right to resent me
and resent how I left things.
But I am here to make amends,
some sort of complete reparation
for all my behaviours.
I told him that I'd do that.
Getting back to this
making-it-all-better notion,
that deal...
All right.
What do you propose?
Well, I... I mean, I hadn't given
it too much, uhh...
the specifics...
I didn't imagine that you had.
This is just a big idea to you,
isn't it?
This hoping to
make it all better?
A grand gesture...
I do want to though.
You want to? Or you're going to?
I will, yes.
Because I don't want you
just to try.
It only works if you actually
do it, no matter what.
No, you're right, okay.
I'm going to.
Good. That's very good.
So, how do we go about it?
How do you help me get back
some of the dignity that I lost?
Just a little piece of it back?
You know,
I suppose I could go out there
and, uhh, to the car
and talk to him, you know,
if that's what you
really, really want,
uhh, something like that.
No, I... I think you're right.
It doesn't really even out
after all this time.
Yeah, I don't see what we gain
by it. So, I don't know why...
Do you want to know
what, uhh, he thinks,
my husband, what he thinks
you should do?
No. What?
This woman that you're marrying,
you haven't said much about her.
Well, there's nothing much
to tell, really.
She'd probably be surprised
to hear that.
Well, I just mean not...
not so much.
You know,
she's studying to be a nurse
and just, uhh, some girl,
this girl that I'm...
I mean, she's terrific.
She's definitely that but...
What? She's what?
I'm just not really so keen
to drag her into this.
I see.
She's younger than me, right?
Hmm?
Younger than me?
Uhh,
yeah, yes. She's 23, in April.
How nice,
youth.
Back when it was over,
I was sure that
that was one of the reasons,
well, the main reason
that you didn't stay,
that you left me, my age.
No. I... No.
That's what I told myself
anyway, what I imagined,
that it wasn't for
a real reason,
some reason
that actually mattered,
but because I was
older than you.
I liked your age.
I did.
And the fact that your
bride-to-be is younger
kind of nails it for me.
Lindsay...
I mean, sort of.
Lindsay, it really wasn't.
Tell me something.
What do you think would be
the most hurtful thing
that we could do to her?
Listen. I don't even want to...
What if you cheated on her?
What? I mean, she'd hate it.
What do you think?
That's what my husband thinks.
He said the same thing.
And I agree. I agree with that
because it...
because it's the other person
who feels the pain.
Right, right.
Maybe we should just...
And since you have promised
to make everything all better,
that's what we'd like you to do.
I'm not following you.
We would like you
to sleep with me again now.
What? Why?
Because you don't want to
and she wouldn't want you to.
But I don't see where that...
Do you want the drapes
open or closed?
Lindsay, look, I realize
that you're mad, okay?
I get that now.
Oh, good. I'm glad that's
coming across for you.
Yes, I understand. But I...
I cannot do this. No, I can't.
Yes, you can.
No.
I said yes.
And I said no, okay?
I mean, I could do this
all day long if you'd like.
But I do want to
do something here. I do.
You said you would.
You said you'd make it up to me.
I know. I know I did.
But I can't.
You can. And you will.
You will do this
while my husband
sits downstairs in our Outback
and waits for me.
Why would I do that?
And you, why would you want to?
Does she know about this?
What? Does who know?
This little tour you're doing,
all these stops you're making.
What do you mean?
You know very well what I mean.
Does your girlfriend
know about this?
No. God, no.
Shall we call her?
It's Alex, isn't it?
My husband tracked her down.
Lindsay, Lindsay, no, hey, stop.
Oh!
Well, then I'd get my pants off
if I were you.
But I can't do this.
Yes, you can.
You are quite capable
of fucking me.
You used to do it all the time,
every moment that I'd let you.
I really...
Always here, in this room...
our special place,
where'd come in between classes.
Do you remember?
We were nice as a couple,
I think.
But it wasn't that
that kept me coming back.
It was your promise
of a future,
that you'd whisper about,
lying there,
with our eyes closed.
That's what I was in love with,
tomorrow.
All those tomorrows
that you kept offering me.
I remember them.
I'm sure you do.
All of that comes very easily
when it's a complete lie.
It's simply a fiction and as
whimsical as a fairy tale.
Oh, God, you were good at it.
An expert at making an honest,
practical woman like me
fall for it, gobble it up.
And then one call, one single
call from a colleague,
could make it all go away;
your courage, your bravado.
I guess that's why you teach it
and write it;
fiction.
It's what you deal in
as a person.
He's not going to come up here
in the middle of this, is he?
No.
For pictures or anything?
Not come bursting in
in the middle of all this?
I promise.
Because that would suck.
Will you tell her?
What are you...
of course not.
Good. Then you'll have to
live with it, like I did,
carry it around.
Until I came clean.
(Sighing)
(Sighing)
I can't believe this.
Shh...
We can talk later...
later, when we're done.
After...
you can tell me all about it.
All about what?
The future, the future
that I'm about to miss.
Come on.
Here.
I know you care.
Close your eyes,
let yourself go.
Tell me something.
Tell me something
that you remember
about us, here.
Keep your eyes closed.
Okay.
I can see us, uh...
I mean, recall us on Thursdays.
On each Thursday
that first, uh...
that semester before Christmas.
I was going off at the holidays
It was killing us for me
to have to do that,
but I promised my folks
I would.
And the two of you,
you and your husband,
who was on sabbatical
in the fall
and you'd agreed to meet him
over in England.
Right before I had to leave,
like an hour before we
both had to fly out,
we met here.
Rolling around in the sheets,
no idea if we could
make it out to Logan
and not even caring.
God...
We weren't worried
about the future.
No, it...
It was so perfect.
It was just...

(Thunder rumbling)
You're right. It's a really
nice view from here.
I thought so.
Corner room makes
all the difference.
I bet it does.
Hey...
I gotta say,
I really wasn't expecting
to hear from you.
Well, I was your brother's
best friend.
I mean, Kelly and I
were always really close.
Not lately though.
No, that's true. Not so much
in the past, uh...
Fifteen years.
Right, right. Yeah,
not for awhile.
Not for, uh, a decade or so.
But this is... I mean, it isn't
by happenstance
or however they call it, right?
Is that a word,
"happenstance?"
Yeah, I think so or
something like it,
very close to that.
Well, you're the big time
writer.
Teacher, really.
I... well, both.
Now I am both.
Anyhow...
You're not here by "that-chance"
or anything are you?
I mean... you're here in Seattle
for me, aren't you?
Isn't that what you said?
That's true. I did
say that.
Anyway... I didn't tell
him the whole thing.
I fibbed a little.
When I talked to Kelly,
I told him you called me up
out of the blue.
Which is true.
Yes.
But it just made him
ask more questions.
Like, "why hadn't you
called him in so long?"
You know...
brother crap.
No. Sure, that's
natural.
Yeah.
He said he'd wanted to
talk to you,
ever since you had done
that story he read.
He even emailed me a copy.
And I guess he wrote you
or something,
to your agent maybe?
And he never heard back,
which bummed him out...
a lot.
He asked me to...
give you this.
Here. It's his work number
and stuff.
Oh, thanks.
No. I never... I would
have seen it, if...
It doesn't really matter.
He was just surprised,
that's all.
Well, I'll check with...
Maybe I'm mixed in with
a bunch of other, uh...
(Sighing)
I have not been so good about
keeping up with everyone
from school.
Gosh, you want to
know a secret?
I'm not even on Facebook.
It's no biggie.
It gets hard. I'm only 26,
it's already hard.
Is that what you are?
Are you 26?
Wow! Wow, time just,
you know?
Yup. It flies.
That's the one.
(Chuckling)
You look a lot older.
Yeah, yeah, I suppose I do.
I must, though. I mean,
sure.
You do too,
although not...
Yeah, well, I was a kid.
I mean, a child, really.
But you were...
I can remember exactly what you
looked like back then, exactly
And I just always had this...
image in my mind of you.
I mean...
Yeah. No, no,
I get it.
And so, for the last few days,
I've been imagining you, but...
it's a much younger guy
that I knew back then.
Sure.
I'm not keeping you
from something, am I?
No, no. God, no.
I forgot the date
and I have...
stuff.
Ah...
You're not really good at
making stuff up, are you?
Not really.
No, not for some man who makes
a living doing it.
Exactly, no. I stand before you
an accused man.
Not yet.
What?
Nothing.
I'm kidding.
(Sighing)
You... want anything?
Um, I'll take a beer,
if they have one.
Uh, Corona or Bud?
Pretty generic selection,
I'm afraid, for such a swanky...
Corona.
Okay.
Oh, super cold.
Hope that's okay.
Hey, I'm not English.
I turned out to be a
complicated girl,
but at least I don't drink
warm beer.
Right, yeah. No wonder
the colonized the world.
"Some ice, some ice! My kingdom
for some ice!"
That was dumb.
I'm sorry.
No. I just don't get it.
What's that from?
Richard III,  Shakespeare.
Right.
"A horse, a horse,
my kingdom for a horse."
Why's he want it so badly?
Oh, uh, he's about to be killed
for all the bad stuff
he's done,
so he's trying to escape.
(Chuckling)
How appropriate.
That's a good one.
I'm lost. What are you...?
He sounds a lot like you.
Or at least you in your story.
So, you've read, uh... a
That email, remember?
Right.
Your character in that,
all those run-ins with women
and his defence is just
to run away,
get out through a window,
whatever it takes to save
his own skin.
Right, but mostly that's
for comic effect,
irony and all that, uh,
the repetition of a motif.
The hasty exit, it's
a classic, sort of, uh...
Still, I don't think that
you just made it all up.
Mostly I did, yeah.
It's satire and it's a send up
of sexual politics as well.
It's based on Candide.
Got it.
Whatever you say, Shakespeare.
"Shakespeare..."
That's a good one.
Well, you always did want to
be a writer, didn't you?
Yeah. I mean, I think so,
yeah, in some ways.
But you can't possibly
remember that, no way.
You'd be surprised.
I remember a lot of things.
Sure, but I don't
even...
I used to watch you.
You were my favourite
of Kelly's friends.
And so, yeah,
I'd follow you guys,
spy on you.
I overheard a bunch of things
you wouldn't even remember.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
(Whispering:)
I was really stealthy.
A regular little Mata Hari.
Well, don't... you forget
what happened to her.
She was killed or something.
Yeah, she was executed
for being a, uh...
for being a spy.
Yeah, but, like, a sexy one.
Uh, sure.
Like me. I mean,
I turned out kind of sexy.
Don't you think?
Just like, objectively
speaking.
Um...
Damn, come on.
Give a girl a little
credit here.
Of course you are,
Reggie. I just...
You're my friend's little
sister, you're Kelly's sis.
That never stopped you before.
Look...
Listen.
Yes, Reggie, you have
turned out
to be a very beautiful
woman, okay? You have.
But you're not just
some gal here.
You and I are...
Connected?
No. I was going to say...
I mean, yes, we are that,
grew up together in the same
neighbourhood and all.
But no, we...
You said you were thinking
about getting a hold of me.
Yup, that's right.
Yeah? How come?
Seriously.
You know.
I guess so.
But why now? Why so much
later in life?
Just cause. I even wrote
about it in my journal...
back then.
Yeah, I've promised myself
we would talk about it one day.
I was looking at it
not too long ago
and it said that "We'd better
talk about it or else!"
"Or else" was even underlined.
Really?
Hey, I was a kid.
What can I say?
I didn't even know you kept
a journal at eleven.
Yup. I wanted to be
a writer too,
because of you.
No.
It's true.
But, I mean, isn't that
what you do now? Or...
Sort of. Journalist anyway,
but mostly freelance.
Yeah, still.
That's...
It's whatever.
It pays the bills.
I do mostly human interest
stories, stuff like that...
stories like ours.
What do you mean?
Nothing.
No, I mean,
I'd never do it, but this would
make a hell of a story;
us meeting again after
all of these years,
what you ended up doing, me,
how things affected me,
who I turned out to be.
You know...
(Sighing)
like you did
in your story.
Except without all the...
what do you call them?
Motifs?
Reggie, I...
I think maybe we should talk.
We are.
This is what we're doing.
Talking...
Yeah, I know that,
but...
just like I promised
we would in my journal,
"or else."
Uh-huh. We are talking about
the same thing, right?
When I was...
Yeah. What happened
the night you slept over,
my twelfth birthday.
Yeah, that's...
'Cause my mom wanted Kelly
to have you stay with us,
so that he wouldn't bug us
girls during the party.
That's when it happened.
All that we... I mean, it was
just a kiss, that's all.
That's all?
Yes.
I'm sorry. I can't
help it.
I'm a journalist, so I sort of
stick to the facts.
You know, I didn't mean
anything by it.
Wow.
Not that it wasn't good.
You enjoyed it?
No, no.
Um...
You didn't?
I did.
No, I mean,
I didn't...
did I enjoy it in some
sexual way or whatnot?
No. But of course
it was nice.
It was nice?
Yeah.
I... I mean, it only lasted
for a few...
It was a kiss, a full kiss,
on my mouth,
twelve year old lips.
Eleven, technically.
I was still actually only
eleven years old.
I know that.
Good. I'm glad.
And what else?
Else?
What else do you remember?
Or should I take this up
with someone else?
You know, my mom or Kelly,
the authorities?
Please don't do that.
I need some closure.
Fine, fine.
Then, okay.
I will, yes. But just
don't do that.
Then tell me.
We... it was so long
ago that I...
You know, I guess...
Why did you come here?
Tell me that.
Why did you come here
to Seattle?
Because I felt like
I wanted to...
I needed to maybe...
What?
What?
What did you need?
To maybe...
I needed to get this
off my chest with you.
Before I get married
and everything,
I just, I wanted to talk
about things
and say, "Yes. I think
about this,
"play around with it in my head,
so she must too.
So, we ought to..."
And then that's about as
far I ever got with it,
but I do think about it,
Reggie.
I do, often.
Well, that's good.
That's good to hear.
And this is the truth.
I was in town recently,
a week or so ago,
for this conference thingy
I attend
and I happened to see you,
just crossing the road
in front of me,
like something out of a movie.
I just... I couldn't
stop thinking about it.
I called and I flew back
here, so that we could...
whatever, maybe have
a moment like this one.
I get it.
Do you remember
touching my ass?
No. Reggie, honestly,
no. I don't.
Because you did,
that night when everybody
else was asleep.
You and I were in the kitchen
and we were talking
and laughing.
You were probably making
fun of me, like usual.
And then somehow, I don't know,
just all of a sudden,
you were right there,
uh, in my face.
And I was scared,
but I didn't leave,
I didn't pull away or anything.
And, um, it was a like a
truth or dare or something,
like in spin the bottle,
no big deal.
But then...
I kissed you.
Yeah, we kissed.
Suddenly, I was aware of...
things,
of... of me.
And I kissed you back.
Just for a few moments,
but we were doing it
like... like some couple.
(Chuckling)
We were kissing and
you whispered,
"I'm going to marry you
someday."
You said that and then I felt
your hand on my, um...
down on...
I didn't mean to, Reggie.
Your hand was there,
slipping into my panties
and you... I...
You made me all, um...
That was too much.
(Sighing)
You did that to me
and I looked at you...
I can remember looking
right into...
those beautiful eyes of yours
and um...
I...
Anyway, afterwards,
I went back up to my friends,
to all my sleeping friends...
who were still just girls...
some girls I was never
going to be like again.
Not ever.
And the next day,
I was looking for you,
just to see what you
were thinking,
talk to you, smile at you,
something.
But you had already gone home.
You snuck back down
the street to your place.
You ran away.
Jesus, Reggie...
I am so, so sorry
if you feel like
I'm responsible.
What?
I don't know.
I didn't even get to the end
of that thought.
I just figured I would get
it out there
while the getting was good.
At least you're funny.
(Chuckling)
Sort of.
(Sighing)
You're always funny.
Thanks.
It's a very...
thank you.
(Sighing)
We were just...
It's okay, I think.
You know, I mean, we probably
shouldn't have done it,
let it happen, but...
you know, we were just kids.
Don't say that.
Don't-don't-don't say it
like that, "kids."
What do you mean?
I was a kid, me.
I was a little girl,
but you weren't.
You were not a child
at all, uh-uh.
You were sixteen.
No, I-I...
September, 23rd of September,
my birthday, remember?
Three days from now.
You were already sixteen.
Yeah, I know,
but...
You were a man.
I don't care.
No matter how you spin it,
you were a man.
Okay, so maybe you couldn't
vote or go to war,
but you had a car
and everything.
You totally knew what
was going on.
You had no right doing
that to me.
Not that night or ever.
Reggie...
No, you're right.
I guess I just need to
tell you about it,
what happened then
and how it affected me.
It's just, um, damn hard,
I don't know, to
let it go, I suppose...
(Sighing)
to let you go.
I get it, I do and I'm so glad
you did this,
told me that.
So, that's it?
We're just gonna, like,
walk away?
Listen, I don't care what you
do to me, I'm saying.
If you want to call someone,
your brother
or the police even, then
that's fine, so be it.
I swear to you, at the time,
I didn't realize.
You know, you're laughing,
we're laughing
and it's your birthday
and so, I decided to...
give you this kiss, this little,
innocent kiss, but it...
(Sighing)
So forgive me, please.
That is what I would like,
is for you to find some way
in your heart to forgive me,
because...
I'd just really appreciate it.
Okay, then.
It's off the list.
(Sighing)
You're free to go.
That's what a woman
kisses like.
You feel the difference?
Yes, I do.
Then good.

It wasn't tomorrow, was it?
I left the paper there with the
details on the counter
and then when you answered
at the door
with your hair all wet,
you know...
Sorry. No, no.
You're just a bit on the
early side, that's all.
Anyway, hello.
Oh, you look great.
Hi...
there. You do too.
You're...
Thanks.
Oh, God!
It's...
Hello.
Hi, stranger.
Yeah, stranger. That's
a good one.
No, it was today.
Good.
This is it, yes. Yup.
(Sniffing)
Is that Dior or something?
That's great.
Jeez, you look...
well, you know, fantastic.
Thanks.
You really do.
Your hair, it's...
Uh, the same as always,
highlights.
But it's longer though.
My, uh, whatever you call it,
my fiancée, she's got those.
Oh, really?
Well, not exactly like that.
She's just got some right here,
calls it "framing her face."
That's...
hmm...
Not as stylish as yours though.
Your boyfriend...
I mean, if you're with anyone
now, must really love...
I'm not.
You know, on the way over here,
I had a crazy idea that
she'd be with you,
the two of you and I'd
have to, you know,
be on display or something.
I don't know.
No. God, I would never
do that.
Well, I didn't know
what to think.
You calling me up
and my parents
and then that email
with all those details?
I don't know.
I'm sorry, but I would
never do that, uh-uh,
make you feel all
uncomfortable.
So, I was one of them, huh?
The lucky ones.
Well, I don't know about lucky,
but, uh, yes, Bobbi.
You came all the way here
to L.A.,
just because you dreamed
about it once? That's why?
Not just that, just a dream.
I'm saying that I, you know,
I really considered it
there, for a moment,
pursuing that.
My sister?
Yes, pursuing that.
But we're... I mean,
we're the same.
Well, not exactly, no.
We're twins, identical twins.
I understand.
So, it would be
like the same...
But...
It'd be the same.
It couldn't be. I mean,
not exactly the same.
No, but, like,
almost identical.
We're twins.
I know that.
I get that part.
It's weird.
I just...
It is hard to explain.
And that's how I ended up here,
by you just dreaming about it?
Basically.
(Sighing)
It felt wrong when I started
to think it through,
so I figured I would just come
down and let you know that.
It's been awhile.
Yes. I'm not great with
letters and stuff.
No, not for a writer.
(Chuckling) True.
I heard you had a story
in something recently?
Yes.
I never saw it.
No, you didn't?
Uh... it went over well,
yeah.
I was very well received.
Um, I'm sure I've got
a copy in my...
No, that's okay.
No?
I don't read much, not anymore,
except x-rays.
Right.
So, anyway, yes. You start
to make all these plans,
wedding plans and your life
begins...
part of your life, anyways,
begins to come back up for you.
Like vomit?
(Chuckling) No.
But it kind of eats
away at you,
as your picking out your tux
and your Cancun tickets.
So I just thought I would
try to jump in there
and try to right some wrongs,
be proactive about it.
So, how many people are
you seeing?
You're the fourth.
Well, no. I actually...
No, yeah. This is
the fourth stop.
And I'm sorry, I'm a
little slow here.
But I'm here because of...
Because of the Billie thing?
No, because you're
important to me.
See, I started by
making a chart.
Um, are you sure you
want to hear this?
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
I realized pretty quickly that,
well, basically, I had
a fair number
of women to choose from,
a group of many.
Do you understand?
Lots.
And I wrote down the
names of the ones
that I felt remotely responsible
for our problems.
After a bunch of revisions...
Yeah?
I narrowed it down
to, like, the finals,
the top five or so,
the ones that I felt were
truly instrumental,
pivotal.
Huh...
I mean, essential...
to me and where I'm at
now as a person.
I see.
Well, I'm glad I made the cut.
What are you...
Bobbi, I mean,
you were easily
up near the front.
You-you were the front.
Do you... I'm a little...
do you want anything?
So, you never heard about her?
Who?
My sister.
No. I remember she was
going to go
do that internship over
in Europe.
Mm-hmm, she did.
That's great.
She went for a couple
of months.
Nice.
She came back and went
to Stanford, actually.
That's a good school.
And then she got the...
She got cancer.
Shit. What?
Yeah.
Really?
Leukemia and died.
I think that's what drove me
to get into medicine.
I... Jesus, Bobbi.
I'm sorry.
The funny thing was,
of all the, you know,
people she knew,
because she was a really
popular girl, Billie,
those last few days, when she
was rolling in and out of...
Billie was asking for you.
She wanted you.
What?
She did.
I don't... why would she?
I don't know.
And that's what I could
never figure out.
But then when you emailed
and said that...
Bobbi, nothing... I'm telling
the truth here.
Nothing happened.
I never...
Are you sure?
No. I mean, yes,
absolutely, of course.
This is a horrible shock.
Oh, my God.
Well, don't take it too hard.
I'm just messing with you.
(Chuckling)
She lives up near
Santa Barbara.
What are you...
I mean, wh...
Look, I'm sorry, but I
couldn't help it.
I mean, why the hell
would you do that?
Oh, come on, please.
Listen to yourself.
"Right some wrongs?"
I am.
You are...
I mean, I'm trying to.
You're looking up old
girlfriends,
that's all your doing.
No, I'm not.
Don't, seriously.
I mean, we're grownups here,
for the most part,
at least I am.
Jesus! That is not
a nice thing to do.
Don't do that!
God!
Cancer?
Look, you're an okay guy.
I liked you a lot,
back however many years ago,
but I don't want this
other memory,
this thing you're doing here,
to be the last image
I have of you. I don't.
I just wanted to say that I've
really been thinking about this
and I had to see you to
look in your face...
See me, talk to me,
ask for my sister's number,
shit, I don't care.
Just don't do some
pathetic thing,
like pretending to
smooth things over...
I'm not.
... as if you're
just dying inside
to make it all good
between us.
I am.
Don't do that.
I really do want to.
I do. Bobbi, I've
always wanted to.
This is not one
of those moments
where I'm really hoping that
you'll kiss me, okay?
What I was trying to do in this
case, was to let you know
that I never did that,
okay? Went after your sister.
Or anybody else for that matter,
because I liked you so much.
I respected you.
I see.
And did you lose respect for me
when you got out there
to Chicago or something?
Because all that respect
you had for me...
No, not at all.
Then how come I didn't
hear from you?
That's the one thing
I never could quite...
I mean, you just took off.
Because I...
I met someone.
Oh.
Yes. I met this
other, uh...
I sort of hooked up with
another girl out there
and well, you know how I feel
about the whole monogamy
thing, so...
You were supposed to be
being monogamous with me.
Right, but I...
So, you just ran off with her?
I mean, who was she?
That you would just...
Just a girl.
Just some...
Some girl, that's all.
Some girl that you...
Yes, that I did that
to you with.
It was a mistake.
I have a little bit of a history
there, doing that kind of thing.
See, now I get it.
After all this time, I now get
what one phone call would
have taken care of.
I should have called you.
You know, I tried to
dozens of times...
That would have helped.
and I kept
hanging up.
I would ring you and then
I would chicken out.
I didn't want you
not to like me.
But you didn't really want me
to like you though either.
True?
Sort of.
It was complicated.
So, you sort of, just
disappeared on me there.
I mean, I figured it out
that you must have...
Yeah, I went with
a clean break.
I didn't want to muddy it up
with a bunch of talking.
(Sighing)
Okay.
Um... I think...
well, I think we're probably
done here, aren't we?
What? No.
Here.
It's a gift certificate
for Williams-Sonoma.
No, I can't accept...
You said you're registered
there.
Stop it. I can't
accept it.
Just take it.
Look, please don't be an asshole
about this too, all right?
Listen, listen,
listen.
Just take it.
What I said before was true,
my reason for being here.
Yeah, really?
Yes, absolutely.
I can't go forward in whatever,
my life or any of that,
without us first getting
to the...
(Sighing in exasperation)
Listen, listen.
Bobbi, please don't let a
misunderstanding from the past,
this sort of rotten behaviour
on my side,
ruin our reunion here.
I do feel bad about what I did
to you, my part in all that.
Which part? The fantasies
about my sister?
Or the dumping me for some
other girl at random part?
Probably all of it.
What?
If I was to really examine it,
to really, really
get down...
You never really do, do you?
The work, I mean.
Not ever.
Well, what is this if it's
not me trying to?
Oh, this isn't work. No,
not what you're doing here.
Don't say that.
I am trying...
You're making sure you haven't
missed out on something.
That's exactly what
you're doing.
No, I'm not.
Yes, you want to know that
this nurse of yours...
isn't that what you said
she studies?
That she's the best
deal you can get,
that she's the nicest,
the sweetest, the prettiest.
No, that's not true.
Bullshit!
Bullshit.
I know you.
I'd just love...
Ew.
What?
To know how many you
actually had on your...
Seriously, how many?
How many girls?
I mean, I bet the sum total
is pretty staggering.
Think whatever you want.
Oh, I will.
Okay, go ahead, do.
I do and I'm going to.
Fine. Jesus Christ, can we at
least be civilized about this?
I mean, God, even if we
just end up as, you know...
Friends? You were not just
about to say that, were you?
Huh?
What... I don't need
any friends.
Or, let me be more specific.
I do not need you.
Well, that is not very nice.
Well, I wasn't trying
to be nice, not at all.
I'm serious.
I mean, why would I want
to be pals with you?
Huh? Buddies?
Especially now.
I barely wanted to see you.
(Chuckling) God!
You were always this
grandiose guy,
but I had no idea,
not until this moment,
that it might actually be
pathological.
So, no, I think friends
is off the list.
Shit. Look, I...
What?
I always meant well.
Fuck you.
That's pathetic.
Oppenheimer meant well,
Pol Pot meant well.
It's not about the meaning.
It's about the doing.
Guys always mean well,
right before they
screw somebody over.
Come on.
What?
That is not, uh...
Not what?
Not what?!
You think it's all right,
just because it's one person
rather than a dozen
or a million?
When-when is hurting okay?
Only when you say so?
Or is it just open season?
All of us going at it,
in any way we see fit?
Look, I am not saying
it's okay to hurt...
Seriously...
But you can't,
you cannot equate, like,
some war with me
not calling you.
Why not? Who says
I can't?
In fact, I already did,
just now
and I'm going to
stand by it, I am,
because when you do
what you do,
which it sounds like
you've done a lot,
people get hurt, injured.
A bit of them, some piece,
it dies.
They lose something that will
never come back, not ever,
this part that you decide
you just take from them
and damage,
piss on.
I didn't take
anything.
You did!
From me you did.
Maybe not what you thought,
but you did do that.
And you didn't care.
You didn't even
look back. And that,
it makes you more than
just an ex-boyfriend.
You're like a killer
or an assassin or some
emotional terrorist, who...
No. You know... you know
what the truth of it is?
All the stuff you do,
it makes you a not
very nice person.
And that's as bad as it gets,
as far as I'm concerned.
Bobbi, this is not what
I wanted to happen.
Well then, surprise.
Wait a second. Wait,
wait, wait, wait.
Just wait a second.
Please don't leave.
Listen, I ran away and all
that shit. Yes, I know that.
But I did look back.
I have been searching for
a way back ever since.
Bobbi, my entire life
since knowing you,
it's been devoted to finding
somebody like you.
It's so obvious to me now.
Look.
Look.
She's pretty.
No, what I mean...
thank you, but no.
What I mean is, a little
similar, huh?
Yeah, she's even in medicine.
I've been deluding myself
this entire time.
What we had...
have,
what there is between us,
it is undeniable.
Then why didn't you come back?
I mean before now,
huh? Why?
Yes, that is an
excellent question
and the truth of it is,
I just wasn't ready.
The best thing in my life
comes over to me in the
student union one day
and sits down across from me
with her lunch.
I'm twenty years old.
It's my only defence.
I was a kid and I just...
I messed up.
Bobbi, I messed up.
I just... what can I say?
No, I can't... I do not
accept that.
But it's the truth!
I don't care!
No. No.
Just wait, just wait.
Don't.
Wait. Okay, just
hang on.
Wait a second.
Stop.
Don't do that. Just listen
to me for a second.
Don't do some last
ditch, shitty thing
that we're both going
to be sorry for.
Just listen, I just
want to talk to you.
What the hell is that?
Hmm?
It's just a... this is
just a...
it's just a mic.
A mic? Like a...
like a microphone?
Why is there a...
Because, I-I...
Are you recording this,
what we're saying
to each other?
Yes, I am taping,
but it is not...
Why? Why? Why
would you...
But it is not...
Don't!
I will sit here while
you explain, I will.
Go ahead, try.
Yes, I am taping,
but it's for work.
I'm writing this piece
for Esquire
and that's it, that's all.
It doesn't really have
anything to do with...
what I said about seeing
you again is true.
Yeah?
All my feelings for you,
completely.
Yeah? Really?
Yes, absolutely.
Wait, wait. Look, look,
I know this seems bad.
I know that, but I just...
will you just give me
a break here
and hear me out?
(Sighing)
All right, okay.
Good.
First off, I acknowledge that
you may not agree with this.
You may feel that what I do
is pornography almost or...
but either way, whether
I am a shit,
or a fearless cartographer
of the soul...
I mean, I had a review that
said that very thing, I did.
But no one is in anyway exempt
from screwing up
once and awhile.
So, okay, I've done
a host of things that,
if you nitpick, absolutely,
they look awful stacked up
end on end.
But... I don't want to keep
getting all sidetracked here.
The point being, I really did
desire to see you again, I did.
And maybe you'd make a buck
or two off of it, right?
Okay, you smoked me out.
So, bully for you.
I sometimes use the people
around me to get story ideas
and help further my career.
Well, Bobbi, that makes
me an American, frankly.
That's about it.
Look, I write amusing
little tales,
while changing the names of
everybody that's involved
and I don't see who's hurt
by it, I really don't.
I'm not, you know, doing this
all haphazardly or something.
It's for Esquire.
Now, just because I am
an author,
does not mean I am not capable
of having human... stuff.
I can't help it if I'm complex.
But I'm not sick.
I'm not evil, Bobbi.
I may be a bunch of things,
but I'm not that.
And I'm not trying to take away
anything from what I did.
I did such a stupid thing back
so many years ago,
but I was just...
young and goofy
and you know, those were
my good qualities.
Bobbi, I am a guy.
I am bad at this.
I found the single
greatest person
I could ever imagine
being near,
I mean standing near even.
And she liked me, me
and that just...
it didn't compute.
It did not make sense,
no matter what she said to me.
So, I just... I made myself
believe it wasn't true
and I ran away, like some
three year old child would do.
But I've grown up since then,
I have.
All this being with other women
and writing about it
and telling myself I should go
visit my past before I marry,
that's all about you.
I don't care if you buy that
or you laugh in my face
or you hate me.
I need you.
No way I'm going to top that,
so I will just leave it off
right there.
It's you, not your sister,
not anybody else I've
ever known,
not even this girl I'm
supposed to marry, no one.
Just you.
I wish you'd say something.
It's very late.
Okay. Is that
metaphoric or...
It's kind of all encompassing.
It's, um...
It's late.
Yeah, but we got...
What are you saying here?
Nothing.
I have to go.
It's for $100, the gift.
(Sighing)
No, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah.
Work was good (Unclear).
Yeah, yes.
But guess what?
I am catching a flight
right now.
Why? Because I miss you,
that's why.
Hey, I love you too.
Yes, I do.
I do so much.
Well, always and always
and always, yes.
(Chuckling)
Always.
I got to go.
Okay, bye.
