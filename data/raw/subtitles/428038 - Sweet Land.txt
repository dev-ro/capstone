Ja. Ja. Olaf, come on.
[Man Speaking Norwegian]

- [Man 1] Nice day though.
[Woman Speaking Norwegian]
[Man]
Those fancy shoes are not for traveling.
Be happy. Uh-
Olaf, how do you-
- Lykkelig.
- "Lykkelig" is happy?
- Yeah.
- I thought "glede" was happy.
No. That's more like "delighted. ''
[Clock Ticking]

Lykkelig.

I'm sorry for your loss, Lars.
I can pay you 2.2 million...
And put up 1,200 homes on this land.
It's what your grandparents would want.
[Banging]
- Lars!
- Dad told me to bike over
and wait for the contract guys.
I didn't want to wake you.
[Stomping]
- Frozen.
- [Chuckles]
- Come in.
- Nah, nah, I don't want to take my boots off.

The president has been resting up after
10 strenuous days ofhis Far Eastern tour.
Tomorrow, he and Mrs. Johnson begin their
official two-day visit in Bangkok itself.
[Man Continues, Indistinct]
You're up.
[Groans]
Olaf Torvik was a caring, giving man...
And I know we'll always remember him.
- He came from Norway in 19-
- Very peaceful.
- 1910?
- It has lovely sunlight.
And homesteaded his farm
the next year.
He cleared the land
with the resolution...
- Welcome, everyone.
- of a pioneer.
[Chattering]
A true settler in the best sense
of the word...
creating civilization
out of the wilderness.
- [Man 2] Inge?
- Most of all, we remember his great love for Inge...
- Did you make this pie?
- his wife of 48 years.
No, this is not mine.
You know that pie?
Olaf died, Frandsen.
You remember?
[Shudders]
Mom, Palmquists are coming to pick up
the casket for the burial tomorrow.
- Now?
- Yeah.
Where does he stay for the night?
I suppose down at the-
[Sighs]
I don't know what they do, Mom.
He belongs here with me.
Well, that doesn't make any sense.
I can't stay here.
We've got the chores-
I don't need you to stay.
He belongs here though.
Lars?
- [Sighs]
- What's filling your head?
Ah.
[Sighs]
What?
I'm not sure what to do.
Lars.
Get yourself and Frandsen a piece of pie.
It's you?
Why are "lykkelig"...
And "glede'' different?
Different kinds of happy.
It's really good.
[Inge]
Different kinds ofhappy.

Just sign this. There.
Immigration?
Do you have farms in the area?
Hello.
Ah.
[Chuckles]
Do you know about our organization?
Well, you should.
'Cause it's in your best interest.
We are suffragists.
- Immigration? [Norwegian]
- It should interest you.
- Suffragists.
- Suffragists.
Yeah. We're unified to ratify
the 19th Amendment to the Constitution-
The American Constitution-
so everyone can vote, especially women.
- That's what it's for. Here you go. Just sign this.

Thank you. [Chuckles]
Just sign your name.
This is very important.
We all have to able to decide on how
we participate in our community, right?
We were opposed to the war, of course...
But we don't try to say that too loudly here
because people might get the wrong idea.
Might think that you're a sympathizer,
or something worse- a lousy German.
- Yes.
- Yeah. [Chuckles]
Okay.
Mister, you... read?
Yeah, sure.
Uh- "Dear Else...
I write to you with bad news."
Uh- "The bank has foreclosed...
"on my farm, and I have been evicted.

Inge from Snasa.
OlafTorvik?
[Sniffles]
Ah.
Thanks.
[Man]
Long trip, eh?
Ships are hideous.
Give me dry land any day.
I was just five years old
when we came across.
- When I came, they checked us
for sickness at Ellis Island.
- Ellis Island?
Yeah. All the doctors were German.
All they said was "tak. ''
Working in the United States of America,
you'd think they'd learn English. Tak.
They rolled my eyelids back
with a matchstick.
Did they do that to you?
We didn't have a picture of you,
so we didn't know what you look like.
Inge from Snasa!
You could've looked like anything, eh?
I think you ought to like waking up
in the morning and looking at your wife.
I said to him, "If we don't know what
she looks like, she shouldn't come."
We should have a photo first.
You're ducky.
I got it.
- No regrets!
- "Ducky"?
Uh, it's a made-up word, like, uh-
- It means "good."
- [Norwegian]
- [Norwegian] Duck, good.
- Yeah.
Yeah. Anyways, uh, here is the place.
[Norwegian]
I'll get it.
Thanks.
That's too heavy for traveling.
[Norwegian]
[Norwegian]
Do you speak any English?
- English?
- Ah. That much.
Deutsch? Talk Deutsch?
No! No. No German around here.
Welcome. Welcome, Inge.
Inge from Snasa.
- I'm Minister Sorrensen. Welcome.
- Hello.
- Frandsen.
- Hello.
Olaf. OlafTorvik.
Are you ready?
- [Grunts]
- Olaf?
Ja. OlafTorvik.
- Olaf?
- Mm-hmm.
Uh, Frandsen. Alvin Frandsen.
- Alvin Frandsen.
- Just Frandsen.
Just Inge.
I thought she understood.
Come in. Come in.
Inge, even though
you've never met this man...
Olaf...
Are you ready to get married?
[Norwegian]
No, no. Only English in
the church. Only English.
Um, she only speaks this much English.
- Uh-
- Well-
Yes?
[Muttering In German]
Spricht Deutsch?
- Deutsch?
- [Speaking German]
[Crowd Murmuring]
[German Continues]
[German]
English only in the church. English.
Your parents sent you a girl to be married,
they didn't tell you she was German?
- I didn't know.
- How could you not know?
My parents wrote me that there was a girl
who would be good to marry.
- We were at war with Germany.
- [Murmuring]
Yes, Frandsen?
Martin Luther was German.
[Chuckles]
German.
[Chuckles]
She is not one of us.
We speak a common language, we have
a common background, common culture.
She is not one of us.
- Do- Do you have papers? Papers?
- [Norwegian]
- Immigration?
- Immigration?
Ja.
But this says that you're
a member of the Socialist party.
- Ja.
- She's a member of the Socialist party!
- [Murmuring]
- Olaf! This is-
- No, no. No, I'm sorry.
- No?
There can be no wedding ceremony today.
Not today. No.
What you need to do immediately
is to go and seeJudge Sundby.
Come.
There will be no ceremony
this afternoon at all.
The judge. That's all the way
over in the county seat.
It'll be okay. Uh-
Maybe we can stay with my wife's cousin.
You hungry? Hungry?
[Inge]
Uh, I could eat a horse.
Come, Inge Altenberg, to eat.
[Horse Whinnying]
Ja, Olaf. Judge Sundby.
[Olaf]
Ja. Okay. Thank you.
[Frandsen]
Hey, look.
My cousin, Hanse, lived there
after the bank took away his farm.
After a week, he came out
onto those steps and blew his head off.
- Boom!
- Boom?
Yeah.
German. What were
you thinking of, Torvik?
- I didn't know.
- [Scoffs]
With a name like Altenberg,
how could you not know?
- Where's that herring?
- I didn't-
Mmm. Did you hear the one...
About the man who went
to the man with no pants?
- No.
- Frandsen, how is the crop?
- Good. Good.
- Good. And the family?
Like the crop.
[Chuckles]
She doesn't look German.
Pretty eyes.
But bewitching.
Devious.
That's the giveaway- those eyes.
[Scoffs]
Mmm, judge?
[Choking]
[Frandsen]
Uh, banker.
But he also owns
the, uh, grain elevator...
and the insurance.
My friend- Um-
My wife's... cousin.
Judge?
[Chuckles]
That'll be the day.
But I do own the only steam tractor in the state.
Full of hot air.
But we will go to the judge tomorrow.
For sure, for sure, for sure.
"For sure, for sure"?
[Norwegian]
Means, "for sure, for sure, for sure."
[Norwegian]
Never bless the day until it's done.
Charming for farming,
but in business...
You've got to make plans.
Business and farming don't mix.
[Laughing]
[Chuckles]
I'll get the bags from the car.
[Laughter Continues]
[Door Closes]
How's the crop, really?
Really good.
It had better be.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Okay.
"Women are considered chattel
of the husband or father, and it is assumed...
That citizenship is the same
as the husband or father."
Immigrations Code 623.3.B.
We just want to be married.
I don't know who this woman
is without the correct papers.
So give us the papers.
We'll go home. I have work to do.
I didn't write 623.3.B.
[Closes Book]
[German]
[Norwegian]
[Norwegian]
[Tapping]
Yes?
- Can we see the judge?
- Judge.
She'll have to take
a literacy test...
And for that she'll need
to know English.
- Was that Norwegian she was speaking?
- She is German.
German?
I'll see ifJudge is available.
[Horses Trotting]
[Door Opens, Closes]
Anyways, the judge says we have to be careful
about this sort of thing.
- What sort of thing?
- German nationals.
German nationals engage in prostitution,
they encourage polygamy...
They harbor dangerous
political convictions.
Are you aware of
the Espionage Act of 1916?
You think she's a spy?
Well, I'll tell you
what's in her favor-
She's not Chinese.
Nice day though.
- [Grunts]
- [Frandsen Mutters]
Olaf, come on.
Help the lady.
- [Norwegian]
- Ja.
- Ducky.
- Ah, ducky.
Hey, let's make a photo.
- No, I have work.
- Oh, shut your trap about the work, Olaf.
And give me the whole shooting match with
the Kodak dingus. You know it won't work for me.
It's just here. You got it?
We're gonna make a photo. Uh-
- Fotographie?
- Yeah, yeah. Come on, Olaf.
Come on.
Here.
- Uh-
- Move your hands, Frandsen.
Here. I want your mug, Olaf.
- [Norwegian]
- Those fancy shoes are not for traveling.
Uh, be happy.
Uh, Olaf, how do you-
- Lykkelig.
- "Lykkelig'' is happy?
- Yeah.
- I thought "glede''was happy.
Uh, that's more like "delighted."
Oh. Happy. Delighted, eh?
- Happy. Delighted.
- What's the difference?
- There's no difference.
- So, why have two words then?
Hmm?
[Inge]
Happy. Delighted.
What about "ducky"?
That's a good word.
- Ducky? Ja.
- Ducky. [Chuckles]
Uh, now, Olaf, put your mug here.
[Film Clattering]
[Groans]
You balled up. I only have one piece of film.
Yeah.
- Not ducky.
- Not ducky?
No. Come on.
No, no, no.
[Norwegian]
Uh, no. You, uh, sleep.
Olaf, tell her.
- [Norwegian]
- Frandsen? No.
- Olaf, no.
- [Norwegian]
Are you sure you want
to marry this one?
Maybe she's right. She just wants a bathroom.
What difference does it make?
Do you have any idea
what your neighbors would say?
Where will you go to church? You'd have to
drive clear to Minneapolis to buy your seed.
Goddamn this whole goddamn mess!
Until we get married, you go with Frandsen.
[Norwegian]
[Norwegian]
You are, uh-
- You are- [Norwegian]
- [Norwegian]
- Behaving badly.
- You are behaving badly.
You are the one who is doing that thing
that you are telling me I am doing.
- Okay, okay, okay.
- [Both Shouting]
Okay, okay.
Olaf! You gotta start my car!

Especially after all you've been through.
Uh, Inge, a bigger, better,
faster way to farm.
- Big-
- Bigger, better, faster.
- Bigger, better, faster.
- That's right.
You hungry?
- Hungry?

- We can find that.
- After you.

[Frandsen]
Uh, Inge.
Her mother's mother, uh- German.

My mother's father was Irish.
My father had Ojibwa blood.
But l- I'm an American.
Mmm... tysk?

Okay. Who would like

Whoo-hoo.
