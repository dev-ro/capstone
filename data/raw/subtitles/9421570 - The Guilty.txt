Breaking news from California,
as wildfires burn
across the Los Angeles region.
The president has declared…
911, fire, medical dispatch.
Fires keep on raining
down the state.
- What's on fire?
- This horrible chemical smell…
A smoky layer in the air.
He's firing a gun.
Will you fucking get
your ass out here now?
Fire and medical dispatch…
The trees are on fire.
Is there a way
you can evacuate your house?
Someone stole my truck with
my three-month-old daughter in the back.
I need
to get my kids outta here.
Whew.
Damn fires.
The air is so bad.
Help me.
- 911. This is Emergency Operator 625.

- Help me.
Okay, sir. Am I speaking to Dru Nashe?
- Yeah.

No, no, no.
- Okay. Where are you then?
- It's dark, and I can't breathe.
- I need to know where you are.
- Fuck, no.
- I show you're in Pacoima.
- Oh fuck.
- What did you take, Dru?
- What?
Did you take drugs, Dru?
- Yeah, I did.
- You shouldn't do that. What did you take?
- Speed.
- Shoot it up or snort it?
- Take a deep breath and answer me.
- I can't breathe. I'm fucking scared.
I understand,
but it's your own fault, isn't it?
- Dru?
- Yes. Just send the fucking ambulance.
Give me your address.
I'll send an ambulance and the police.
No, no! Fuck! No, no, no!
Fuck!
Dru?
This is Joe.
Joe, hey,
do you have time to answer
a couple questions about tomorrow?
- Who is this?
- I just have some questions.
- I asked who's calling.
- It's Katherine Harbor.
Are you a journalist?
I thought I said I was.
I'm with the Los Angeles Times.
Is this a bad time? I can call back.
Shouldn't you introduce yourself properly
before you ask questions?
- I wanna get your side of the story.
- How'd you get this number?
- I'm writing about your case...
- How'd you get this number?
As I said, no comment.
- You have my number…
- Baylor. No calls. I already told you.
Thought that was a fucking job.
Hello.
I'm sorry. I'm back. Yes. What is…
- 911. This is Emergency Operator 625.
- My dog…
- What is the address of your emergency?
- Is this the fire department?
No, ma'am, you've reached 911.
I can connect you to fire. Hold the line.
- I can see the flames up the hillside.
- I understand.
Hold one moment. I'll connect you to fire.
{\an8}I need an actual address, yeah.
911. This is Emergency Operator 625.
What is the address of your emergency?
My name is Matthew Fontenot.
I'm friends with the governor.
I'm here on important business.
I've been robbed.
Sir, I need to know where you are.
Last name, Matthew?
- Fontenot. Matthew Fontenot.
- How do you spell that, sir?
F-O-N-T-E-N-O-T.
- Where are you?
- I'm in my car, man. Come quick!
Are you in downtown Los Angeles?
I… I… I think so. I'm here on business.
- I understand, sir. Where are you?
- Bro, doesn't your computer show that?
- No, unfortunately it's not exact.
- I need the fucking police!
I need an address. Get out of your car.
Read a street sign or give me a landmark.
I just told you I just got robbed!
I'm not leaving my fucking car!
{\an8}- What happened, sir?
- What…
{\an8}A woman pulled a knife
and took my wallet and computer. Okay?
It has all my work.
- And did this just happen?
- Yes.
- On the street?
- Yeah, no.
- In my fucking car, man. I just told you.
- How'd she get in your car?
I… Does it matter?
Um… Excuse me? I…
She just jumped in, okay?
Mm. "Jumped in."
Get the fuck outta here!
Give me back my fucking computer.
- Uh, do you see the Wells Fargo building?
- I'm on the phone with the police.
- Sir?
- Yes, I'm right below it.
You are on Bunker Hill
in the Financial District.
- I need your license plate number.
- I don't know it. It's a rental.
- Is there a door?
- This is fucking crazy.
On the car? Yes, there's a door.
Okay. Open it, get out,
and give me your plate number.
I told you,
I'm not getting out of the car.
Then it should be on the registration.
That should be in your glove compartment.
Can you tell me how long it's gonna take?
Aren't you supposed
to fucking protect me, man?
- Hmm.
- Jesus Christ. Where on the registration?
Okay, I've got it.
"2DTN35S."
- Make and model of the car, sir?
- It's a blue 7 Series BMW.
What does she look like?
{\an8}She was young, tall,
dark skin, pink hair, in heels.
Um…
- Race?
- Mexican. Uh, Hispanic.
Other details you can remember?
She was, uh, voluptuous.
I mean, you know, she was...
Hold the line.
I'm gonna get you a dispatcher.
A physical address.
That's perfect, thank you.
LAPD Communications.
This is Sergeant Miller.
This is Officer Baylor.
I have a robbery on Bunker Hill.
- Suspect is armed, and...
- Oh, Officer Baylor!
- Are you kidding me? It's Bill.
- Wait, Sarge?
Management rotation thing every week.
- What? Sarge?
- Yeah.
What in the fuck
are you doing at dispatch?
Equal latitude initiative. Every sergeant
mans the phones twice a month.
Oh. That's a good use of resources.
Yeah, political geniuses with ideas
about how to do our fucking job.
This phone duty is shit.
You think so? I… I think it's fantastic.
Tomorrow,
you're going to be back on the street.
Can't wait.
We better get on with this.
What do you got?
I got a, um, Matthew Fontenot
robbed by a prostitute on Bunker Hill.
- Some Hispanic broad, pink hair.
- Lovely.
Uh, plate number is California
two-David-Tom-Nora-three-five-Sam.
All right, roger.
We'll get somebody out there.
Uh, you can let him sit
and stew in it for a bit.
Lovely.
Hey, Sarge. I heard about
that pinch at Harbor Division last week.
Yeah, it was wild. Like 13 kilos.
- AK's stash?
- Yeah, we got him.
- You bring Major Narcotics?
- Yeah, of course.
Yeah, it was, uh, Chayney and Hunt.
They brought SWAT.
Nice.
Everything okay with Rick?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't it be?
- No reason.
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah. He's good.
- Right.
I'll get the unit en route.
Talk to you later.
- Later, Sarge.
- Bye.
911 Emergency Operator 125.
What is the address of your emergency?
- See what he looked like?
- Hello?
- I'm back, sir.
- Jesus, finally!
Hey, I've got a wife, man.
She's an angry woman.
She's very strong physically.
She doesn't know. I'm just on business.
- Officers are on their way, sir.
- And…
Try and settle down
until the officer arrives.
No. A steak knife duct-taped
to a broom handle is not…
Yes. In five minutes. Yes.
Sir, you still there?
Where are you right now?
And what is the address
of your emergency?
Can you read the street sign?
Okay, good. Is there a cross street?
Cross street.
{\an8}Okay. Did you get a look at the car, sir?
What color was the vehicle?
Sir, did you see the direction
the car was moving?
Okay, down Slauson. Okay, sir.
Please hold. Please… Please hold.
911 Emergency, Officer 136.
What is your emergency?
Can you have her try
and lie down and wait for help to arrive.
- Hey, can I take a quickie?
- Yeah.
Hey, it's Jess.
You know what to do. Leave a message.
I know that I'm not supposed to, um…
But if Paige is awake,
uh, could I say good night?
It would mean a lot.
Bye.
It's ringing! Jesus, man.
911. Emergency Operator 625.
What is the address of your emergency?

Emily, does the person

I don't know.
Have you been abducted?
Yes.
Okay.
Emily, try and keep calm.
We need to figure out where you are.
Right, I show that
you're outside city limits.
Try and stay calm. Keep pretending
like you're talking to your child.
Talk to me like I'm your child.
Um, Mommy's gonna be
home soon, okay, sweetie?
Good. Are you on the freeway?
- Yes.
- The I-10?

- Okay, you're going east.
- Yes.
- Okay.
Hey, give me the phone.
Stay on the phone with me, Emily.
Say your child's upset.
- She's upset. She's upset.
- I have to put you on hold.
No. No!
I have to. Hold the line.
Act like you're comforting your child.
Come on, Emily.
Don't be upset. I'll be home soon.
Good. I'll be right back.
Fucking pick up.
California Highway Patrol.
This is Officer Joe Baylor.
LAPD Communications.
I have a woman who's been abducted.
She's traveling in a vehicle somewhere
eastbound on the I-10, east to downtown.
- You have any units available?
- I'll check.
Find one? Hello?
- I have some nearby.
- Then send them east.
You have a plate number?
No, but the woman will tell me when
she sees the officers pass. Hold the line.
- Okay, sweetie.
- Emily, I'm back.
CHP is looking for you.
When they pass you, you tell me.
- I'll have them pull you over, okay?
- Okay.
- Okay, let's wait, Emily. Okay?
- Yes.
They'll be there soon.
Yes, yes, sweetie.
Shit.
What?
- Emily.
- What?
Emily. Emily, act like
you're comforting your child, okay?
Mommy's gonna be home soon,
okay, sweetie?
Tell her to go to… Tell her to go to bed.
It's bedtime, sweetie.
I'm sorry.
- It's bedtime, sweetie.
- There you go. Come on. Yeah. Good.
Just keep it up.
Keep it up. We're on our way.
You just leave the light on, okay?
Come on. That's enough.
Give me the phone. Let me talk to her.
She only wants to talk to you.
Tell him that.
- She only wants to talk to you.
- Give me the phone.
She only wants to talk to me.
She doesn't want to talk to you.
I'm sorry.
I need the color of the car.
When I say the right one, say it's fine.
Red, blue, black, white...
- It's fine.
- White?
- Yes.
- Is it a car?
{\an8}- No.
- Truck?
- Van.
- What?
No, just yes-or-no answers, Emily.
- What was that?
- Sorry, I have to hang up.
- Emily. Don't hang up.
- I have to hang up.
- Put the phone on the floor, in a pock...
- Who're you talking to?
{\an8}Anywhere he can't see it.
Keep it on so we can track you.
{\an8}If you can't, call me back.
- Joe. I'll be waiting.
- I have to hang up.
Do you hear me?
I'll be waiting. My name is…
Fuck!
It's Joe. I lost her.
She exited city limits.
You have air support available?
Air support
is grounded due to fire weather.
High winds, heavy smoke, no visibility.
Have the officer
call me on the inside line.
- What are you trying to do...
- Just have him call me!
God damn it.
Stand by.
This is Officer Joe Baylor,
LAPD Communications.
This is Officer Rodriguez with CHP.
I was told to call you.
- What is your location?
- We're I-10 eastbound in the Fontana area.
- What's your speed?
- About 90.
- What are we looking for?
- A white van.
- Sorry, say again?
- A white van.
- They're looking for a white van.
- Okay.
- There's a van just ahead.
- What color?
Can't see yet.
There's wind and smoke everywhere.
- Pull up next to them.
- Don't tell me what to fucking do.
- Okay, that must be him, right?
- Man, so much smoke.
He's turning off.
He must've seen us.
- Pull up next to him.
- Can't. He took the exit.
- Pull up next to him.
- Can't.
Fucking follow him!
- There he is.
- Okay.
- Okay, he's pulling over.
- Is it white?
Can't see through all the dust.
- Is he armed?
- I don't know. It's possible.
10-4.
Okay, here we go.
Highway Patrol!
Let me see your hands!
- I didn't do anything.
- Where I can see 'em!
- Keep 'em on the wheel!
- What'd I do?
Step out
of the vehicle. Step out!
Stop. Let me see your hands.
Let me see 'em!
I am. I put them up. They're up!
- Any weapons?
- No, man.
- What are you carrying?
- Officer, what's the matter?
Watch him.
Watch him, I got it.
Wrong van, LAPD. No woman.
What?
Are you sure?
Yes.
Is it white?
It's white or silver.
It's hard to see. The sky's on fire.
- California Highway Patrol.
- This is Joe. They stopped the wrong van.
I'll advise all units.
What are we looking for?
- A white van.
- That's not enough.
- I have six patrol cars up here.
- I know, I know. License plate.
All I have is a driver's license
and address, but I keep looking.
Look for a plate number,
then I'll inform the officers.
All right, I'll keep looking.
What about closing the freeway?
Hold.
Watch commander says negative.
We don't have enough...
Just fucking find a car
and block the freeway.
Come on!
- We don't know where they're headed.
- Quiet, Baylor!
We've got officers dealing with
multiple fire-related incidents.
Fucking fire.
Look for a plate number
and I'll inform the...
It's not me.
Mommy?
- Mommy?
- Uh, this is officer Joe Baylor, LAPD.
Is your mommy or daddy home?
- No.
- What's your name?
- Abby.
- How old are you?
- Six years and nine months.
- Six years and nine months.
- My brother's home too.
- Good. Can I talk to him?
He's a baby.
Abby, what is your mommy's name?
{\an8}Is it Emily?
- They're not here.
- Who is not here?
- Mommy and Daddy.
- Where'd they go?
They just left me.
Does your daddy have a white van?
Does he have a big white car?
Uh-huh.
What's your daddy's name?
What's your mommy call your daddy?
Henry. I call him Daddy.
He says I can call him anytime I want.
Abby? Abby?
- Abby...
- I call Daddy.
What were the numbers you just pressed?
213-100-72…
Wait, 72-what?
Abby, can you say those numbers again?
213-100-7200. 
That's good. That's good.
Oh…
Henry Fisher. Perfect.
Daddy helped me remember.
He showed me the numbers.
{\an8}That's good. You're very smart.
Do you know that?
{\an8}Uh-huh.
{\an8}Plate number.
Does your daddy live with you, Abby?
I go there.
- I… I want Mommy.
- Abby.
I want my mommy.
Abby. Abby, don't cry.
Abby?
Everything's gonna be all right. Okay?
The knife scared Oliver.
What?
Daddy yelled at Mommy. She was crying.
- Is Oliver your little brother's name?
- Yes.
And your daddy had a knife?
I want Mommy.
I know. I just talked to your mommy.
She's gonna be okay.
- Do you promise?
- I pro… I promise.
I promise. Okay?
Abby, we're the police.
- Do you know who the police are?
- Yes.
We're protectors.
No.
We protect people that need help.
You hurt people. You took my daddy away.
Where's my mommy?
I'm gonna find your mommy.
I'm gonna bring her back
to you and your little brother.
You want me to do that?
- I want Mommy.
- I know.
I get scared of being alone too.
You know what I do when I'm lonely?
I turn on the TV, and I have company.
Why don't you go do that?
It's broken.
Why don't you go sit
with your little brother?
- He's sleeping.
- It's okay. Just go in there.
Dad said don't wake him up.
You won't wake him up
if you're very, very quiet.
In the meantime,
I'm gonna send some officers over there
to look after you and Oliver, okay?
I don't wanna talk anymore. I want Mommy.
Someone's going to be with you soon.
If you need help, then call 911.
Can you say that for me?
911.
You press those numbers,
just like you call your daddy.
- 911.
- That's right.
And my name is Joe. Can you say that?
911. Joe.
Good. Good girl, Abby.
Okay, bye-bye.
What's going on?
What the… Mind your own fucking business.
Has anyone gotten a call
from Emily Lighton?
What's going on, Baylor? What do you need?
Just… have you gotten
a call from an Emily Lighton?
- Well, how about you, Manny?
- No.
- California Highway Patrol.
- It's Joe.
{\an8}Plate number is California
two-Frank-Tom-David-twelve-King.
Two-Frank-Tom-David-twelve-King.
I'll pass it on.
She's with her ex.
Henry Fisher. He took her.
- 10-4.
- The suspect has a knife.
- I'll pass it on.
- And a history of assault.
I'll relay the plate number.
Is there a unit you can send to her house?
- I have to relay the plate now.
- Right, but what's your plan?
- To wait until they find the van?
- Yeah, but you need a plan.
- Joe.
- There's a little girl...
The quicker they get the plate number,
the faster we'll find them, right?
No, no, no. Listen.
- You have to make sure...
- Thanks for the plate number.
Listen, I was thinking
that if you could send a car...
No, you listen.
Listen!
I am up to my ass in calls.
Wait for her to call back.
Do your job, and I'll do mine. Okay?
Okay?
Yeah.
Good.
By the way, I...
16-Adam-71. 16-Adam-71.
Welfare check
on 5800 Regis Street, Apartment 6.
Two juveniles home alone. Respond code 2.
16-Adam-71, roger.
Be advised,
we're stacked up on multiple fire calls.
You can show us en route
with an extended ETA.
16...
Shit.
Jess?
Joe, I want you to be able
to tell your side. It runs tomorrow.
- Who is this?
- I just have a few questions.
Who is this?
Katherine Harbor
from the Los Angeles Times.
- Katherine Harbor, stop calling me.
- Listen to me.
Hey, Manny. Oh, it's…
Hey, is it cold in here?
Feels all right to me.
- Manny?
- Yeah?
I've been an asshole.
- Not just today, but in general.
- Yes, you have.
We should get a beer sometime.
That sounds good, man.
Hey, I got a technical question.
Sure.
Uh, if I log out of my computer
and I log into another one,
will I still get the same calls?
Yes, they follow your login,
not your computer.
So your system can go anywhere you go.
Where you going? We're off in 15.
What about the beer?
LAPD Communications.
This is Sergeant Miller.
Hey, Sarge. It's Joe.
Hey. Christ!
Do you ever go home?
Am I interrupting something?
No, God, no.
This is more boring than taking a shit.
Not if you're constipated.
Well, yeah, that's true.
You got a sec?
Sure, man, it's calm down here. What's up?
I need you to do me a favor.
Sure thing. What do you need?
{\an8}Could you send a car over
to 5800 Regis Street, Apartment 6?
{\an8}- It's urgent.
- All right. Yeah, you got it. Why?
I'm working a convicted felon,
kidnapped his ex-wife,
left two kids at the mother's house.
I need someone to send a unit over there.
Okay, uh, how do you know
the kids are in there?
I spoke to a girl, Abby.
All right, and are the parents home?
No. He took her and they're mobile
somewhere east of the city.
- And did you talk to CHP?
- Yes. But CHP is looking for the vehicle.
Sarge, look…
…they don't live together
and both of their residences
are in our jurisdiction,
so I need you to send
a unit over to the mother's house.
And I need you
to send another unit…
over to his house.
Well, is there anyone at his house?
I think he lives alone, but there might be
clues to where they're going over at his.
- Mm-hmm. I don't know, Joe.
- We need to hurry.
Get a unit to the mother's house
and one to his.
Kick his fucking door in if you have to.
- Hmm. What… What was that?
- Kick his fucking door in.
Joe, excuse me?
I talked to a terrified six-year-old girl,
and I promised her
that her mother would come home.
I'm assuming that
there's no warrant for his residence.
So I'm gonna send someone
to the mother's house to check on the kid.
No. I need you
to send a unit over to his house,
and I need you
to send a unit over to her house.
- Joe, it's too much...
- No, God damn it, Bill!
There is a scared little girl
whose mother has been abducted.
That's enough! It's enough!
What are you trying to do?
You are in enough trouble already.
I will send a car to the mother's house,
but I'm not gonna have
anyone kicking in any fucking doors.
It's not your job.
- I know that.
- Yeah, well, apparently you don't.
Does this have
anything to do with tomorrow?
What? No. I'm just trying to…
- You want to talk to a new psychologist?
- I'm just trying to help.
- Do you need to do that?
- No.
I mean, I know
you didn't get along with the last one.
No. I'm fine.
- What's that?
- No, I'm fine.
Okay. All right.
So then, when are you off?
I don't know. Uh, ten minutes.
Okay, good.
You're gonna go to court tomorrow.
Afterwards, you'll be back on the street,
and you'll be off the phone.
- That's what you want, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Isn't it, Joe?
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
All right. Okay.
- Send my love to Jess.
- She's not here.
When you get home.
- I'll talk to you later.
- Yeah.
This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…
Stop it.
Leave me a message,
call later, or send a text.
- California Highway...
- It's Joe. Find the van?
No, not yet.
Why are you calling? You have an update?
No.
Jess?
Hello? Hello? Are you…
I… I wake you up?
You gotta stop doing this, Joe.
- You're up late.
- Come on.
We've been separated for six months now.
I'm not gonna keep doing this with you.
I just wanted to say good night to Paige.
Okay. Well, she's asleep, Joe.
Well, I was thinking about her.
It's two o'clock in the morning.
Listen to me, Joe.
You can't keep doing this.
Okay? It's confusing to her.
Don't you get that?
- We agreed on times...
- I want to talk to my daughter.
- Paige needs rules.
- I don't und...
- Do you get that, Joe?
- Come on, Jess.
Because it's like, you keep doing
whatever you want time after time.
You don't even give a shit
about what's best for anyone else.
All right. Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ. Okay.
Know what? I'm not doing this with you.
No, Jess, just hold on. Hold on.
Wait. Wait. Wait. Just wait.
How was, uh, um… that job interview?
The, uh… the…
the one at the, uh, that art place?
It's next week.
Oh.
Oh.
Look, I'm just… I'm, like…
I'm, like, losing, uh, track of time.
I just, like…
I just can't sleep in that Airbnb.
And I just keep… Watch too much TV.
Yeah.
Okay, Joe, uh…
Look, I'm gonna
go back to sleep, okay?
Wait.
- Just try to…
- Wait. Have…
Have you, uh…
Did you talk to Vikki about… about Rick?
- Jesus, please. Please, Joe.
- Come on.
You said you wouldn't do this to me.
God.
Uh, yeah, Vikki said that there were…
federal officers over there the other day,
offering him something…
Maybe. I mean, I don't know. Joe, please.
Were they over at our house?
Stop. I'm not… I'm not doing this, Joe.
Why did you just call me? Tell me that.
- They weren't over at our house?
- No. Nobody came to our house, all right?
Okay?
Are you coming tomorrow?
I don't really think
that's such a good idea.
'Cause you know it would look really good
to have the wife there, you know?
Right. Yeah. Okay.
- I'm gonna go, Joe.
- What did I… What did I say?
- I'm hanging up.
- Why you got to be… What...
- Good luck tomorrow.
- Jess.
- Yes?
- Barrakuda now!
- Let's just go.
- The doorman just attacked us.
- Get the police down here now!
- Where are you?
At the fucking Barrakuda! I told you!
- I need an address.
- Hey! Get away from him.
Sir, are you in the Valley?
Get away from him!
- Fuck this. I'll figure it out.
- No.
- You need to let the police come there...
- Fuck you! Forget it.
What, fuck me?
- Fuck me?
- Yeah, fuck you! Go to hell!
- Yeah, fuck you!
- Go to hell!
Henry.
Who is this?
This is officer Joe Baylor, LAPD.
Sorry to call so late.
You know your daughter
and son are home alone?
My wife and I are separated.
We're separated.
Do you know where your wife is?
No.
When was the last time
you saw or talked to her?
I don't know.
Well, don't you think you should
go check in on your children?
I can't do that right now.
What? Well, are you busy with something?
Yeah.
I know Emily is with you.
You don't know shit.
Where are you going?
- What?
- Where are you going?
What are you talking about?
Well, I know you've been to LAC, huh?
I know you've done time at LAC, huh?
- What?
- You want to fucking do more?
- Huh? You wanna do more?
- Uh…
- This is Henry.
- Fuck. Fuck!
- What's up, partner?
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. Something wrong?
- Where are you?
At the station. I just got off duty.
Bueno. Do me a favor.
Sure. What is it?
- Is your car there?
- At the station?
I need you to go to Foothill.
I'll explain to you when you get there.
- Yes.
- Rick?
You're not at the station, are you?
Yeah, I am.
You don't sound like you.
You sound strange.
Have you been drinking?
I'm not strange.
- You haven't been drinking, have you?
- Nope.
Joe…
You don't drink, Rick.
- You don't drink.
- I know.
How many times are you gonna say that?
- You're my witness tomorrow.
- I know. I know.
I can't have
you coming to courthouse hungover.
No, of course not.
- It's just that…
- What?
Just… I'm fucking afraid.
This isn't gonna go our way.
I had the feds at my house this morning.
You understand?
I'm afraid I might say the wrong thing.
- Hey, hey, I know, you...
- Joe, I'm afraid it...
You're not gonna say the wrong thing.
- After tomorrow, we'll be back at it.
- Joe?
I'm tired of this. It's been eight months.
I know. Me too, homie. I know.
- I know.
- Yeah. Yeah.
How much have you had to drink?
I'm sorry. Just one or two.
All right, so you can still drive.
I need you to go…
{\an8}to 1605 North Tujunga
in Foothill, all right?
A Henry Fisher lives there, all right?
Baylor.
- You got it?
- Got it.
Okay. All right, just drive safe.
All right, and hurry.
What, am I not
supposed to talk in here either?
No, in here's fine. You could do something
about your attitude, though.
What?
You got a phone call, a little girl.
- Abby?
- She didn't tell me her name.
- Do you want me to put her through?
- Yeah, put her through. Yes!
You want to try that again?
- Sorry.
- Okay.
Abby?
{\an8}I'm not supposed to open the door.
It's okay. All right? They're my friends.
- It's the police. You can let them in.
- Mommy said not to.
It's okay.
They're gonna stay with you
until your mommy comes home.
- Hi, my name is Tim. This is Nadia.
- Hi.
We're police officers.
- Is that for me?
- Yes.
Hello, Officer Tim Geraci.
This is officer Joe Baylor,
LAPD Communications.
Hi. We're checking in on two kids?
Yes. Abby and her little brother.
I have to keep the line open
'cause her mother might call.
- I think probably you can find...
- Did you hurt yourself, Abby?
It's not mine.
She has blood
on her hands and shirt.
What's going on?
Check on Oliver.
Abby, do you know
where your little brother is?
He's sleeping.
Okay, well,
just wait here with Nadia, all right?
Wait here with me.
Oh, this place is a wreck.
- Hello?
- Just find Oliver.
- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know. Just look around.
I'm in the kitchen right now, it's…
- There's the bedroom.
- You find him?
This must be it.
- Tim, are you there?
- Hold on. Hold on.
There's bloodstains on the floor.
Oh my God!
LAPD, we need medical immediately.
What's going on?
Oh. Oh!
- Tim, what's going on?
- Oh my God!
Nadia, get in here! 
- Tim?
- All right, I'm coming!
Are you there?
Just check
if he's breathing, all right?
- All right, I'm on it.
- What the fuck is going on?
- What's wrong with you?
- Don't let her in!
- I don't think he's breathing.
- Stay outside!
- Dad said don't wake him up.
- Nadia, close the door.
- Get back.
- Is he okay?
- Tim?
- What's wrong with Oliver?
- Stay with him.
- On it.
Abby, just come with...
Yo, Tim? Tim?
Joe, shift is over.
Day watch is here. We're off.
Uh…
I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.
Joe, is everything okay?
Yeah.
Well, look, um, good luck tomorrow, huh?
Don't call me.
I know what you did to the baby.
Shh. Don't call me.
Abby saw what you did to Oliver.
Are you gonna kill her now too?
I told her not to go in there.
- She shouldn't have gone in there.
- She's six years old!
What do you think she was gonna do?
She is covered in his blood.
Henry, this stops here, right now.
You stop the car, and you tell me
where you are. I will send help.
- I can't do that.
- You have to.
What if I do…
Yes?
- What will happen?
- To you? You go back to prison.
Yeah, no, that can't happen.
That can't happen? That can't happen?
What do you want me to say?
That you're a victim?
Huh? You think you're a victim?
You're not a victim. Emily is a victim.
Oliver is a victim. Abby's a victim.
You're not a victim. You're a…
You should be fucking executed!
This is Henry, leave a message.
This is Henry, leave a...
{\an8}- Rick.
- I'm at the address.
{\an8}Some courtyard apartments. Looks like
nobody's home. The lights are out.
{\an8}Kick the door in.
- What?
- Just trust me.
Stop fucking around. Tell me why I'm here.
The man who lived there
killed one of his kids, a baby.
He abducted his ex-wife.
We need to know where they're going.
How'd you get this?
Answering a 911 call.
Of course you did. Fucking shit magnet.
Hello. Hello? Police.
Hello, this is the police.
- What's going on? Rick?
- Shit!
Rick, what's up? Rick?
Big fucking dog on a chain in the house.
Fuck.
All right, you get in?
- You get in?
- Yeah.
- All right.
- Door was open.
- Yeah. He must have been in a hurry.
- Look around.
There's not much.
Place is practically empty.
There's a mattress, some toys, unopened.
There's something's else.
A stack of letters on the floor,
an address book.
Damn. A lot of bills.
DWP, parking ticket, parking ticket…
- There's five parking violations.
- What else?
Come on. I can't, Joe.
There's so much shit here.
Rick, Rick, please.
It'll take me hours. Do you realize
how many letters and papers there are?
- She'll be dead by the time I'm done.
- What is that supposed to mean?
Nothing. Time is against us.
Right. So get going.
All right? You got it?
Yeah.
Emily?
Emily, you listening? Do you hear me?
- Abby.
- Okay.
Hey, give me the phone.
- Emily…
- Give me the phone.
Is your seat belt on?
No.
- Does Henry?
- Come on.
- No.
- Put yours on.
Come on. Give me the phone.
I need to talk to her. Now.
Is it on?
Yes.
Okay.
Now listen,
I need you to pull the handbrake hard.
Pull.
No, no, no!
- Emily?
- This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…
- Emily? What?
- I crashed my bike and hurt my knee.
- Uh, hello? I crashed...
- I can't talk now. Call back later.
- Emily?
- I crashed my bike and hurt my knee.
Sir, I'm sorry. I can't talk right now.
What was that? Are you kidding me?
When you call, you get the same operator.
- Just please call back later.
- Excuse me? Just send an ambulance.
- What? For your knee?
- Yeah.
Call an Uber,
and don't bike drunk, asshole.
Emily?
I did the thing
that you said, but it didn't work.
- I can't get out.
- Okay. I know. You're headed toward…
You're headed towards San Bernardino.
- Do you know where?
- I can't see anything.
{\an8}I don't want to get locked up.
No, but where are you going?
I'll get you out of the car.
I don't want to get locked up.
- Emily.
- I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
No, nobody's gonna die.
Nobody's gonna die.
- I have to put you on hold. Okay, Emily?
- Please, help me.
Emily, if I'm gonna help you…
- Just hold the line. I'll be right back.
- Please.
LAPD Communications,
Sergeant Miller.
It's Joe.
- Joe, what? You're still at work?
- Oh shit. Bill?
- I meant to call CHP.
- Didn't I tell you to go home?
- No. I can't right now.
- What the fuck, Joe?
- California Highway Patrol.
- It's Joe.
I have Emily on the other line.
She's in the back of the van.
It looks like they're headed
somewhere near the 10 and the 210
towards San Bernardino.
- No, I need a better location.
- Shit!
Fuck, shit! They just…
It switched cell towers.
- I have her on the other line.
- I told you, I need a better location.
I'll get it. Just… Just…
Just send units up the 210 from the 10.
- How will you get it?
- I'll get her out of the car.
- Emily?
- Oh God. Please don't hang up.
- Emily, I'm back.
- Please don't hang up.
I won't. All right.
I just want to go home to my kids.
- They shouldn't be alone.
- All right, now just listen.
He put me in the back of the van
and I can't see anything.
- No. Emily, listen to me.
- I don't know why he's doing this.
Listen to my voice, Emily.
All right? I'm with you.
- He's gonna lock me up.
- You're not alone.
All right? Do you understand?
I don't want to die. 
Okay…
What does Henry do?
Why does Henry have a van?
- I'm gonna die.
- No, you're not. Emily. Emily...
- I'm gonna die.
- Emily, take a deep breath.
Now, I'm gonna get you back to Abby,
but I need your help. All right?
I need you to find something in the van
to defend yourself with.
- Is there anything back there?
- I can't see anything.
Just feel around you.
Use the flashlight on your phone.
There's a cardboard box. A heavy box.
- Bricks.
- Okay. Okay, good.
Good. Okay. Can you pick one up?
I have one. I have one.
Good. Okay, good. Okay.
Now, listen, Emily.
When he stops the van
and he opens those doors,
I want you to hit him
in the head as hard as you can.
- I can't do that.
- You understand?
- You can.
- I can't do that.
- Emily?
- Oh no.
- Emily, you can.
- I can't.
Then you take his knife
and then you tell me where you are,
and I will send help.
I can't.
Yes, you can, Emily. Emily.
- I don't know why he's doing this.
- Emily. Emily, breathe. Emily, breathe.
Come on. Come on now.
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm gonna die.
Just like this. Just like this.
Come on. Just like… Come on, Emily.
- Emily.
- I'm gonna die.
You're not. Emily, breathe with me.
Breathe. Breathe, Emily. Breathe with me.
Emily, what's your favorite…
what's your favorite food?
Emily, what's your favorite food?
Cherry…
cherry Slurpees.
Cherry Slurpees.
I don't know if that's a… a food.
What… What do you like
to do with your kids? Huh?
What's a nice thing…
Keep breathing with me, all right?
- I like...
- What do you like to do in your free time?
I like to be with Abby
and with Oliver, but Henry… 
Henry…
What do you do with your kids, Emily?
What's a nice thing you do? Come on.
Come on.
We like the aquarium.
Where?
San Pedro.
Have you been there?
No, I've always meant to,
uh, take my daughter there,
but we never had a chance to.
Tell me about…
Tell me about the aquarium. Is it nice?
Abby… Abby likes the turtles.
She doesn't even look
at the sharks. 
What do…
What do you like? You like the sharks?
I like all of them.
I usually walk behind Abby
with Oliver in the baby carriage,
and then I just look
and feel.
Feel what?
Seems so peaceful.
What does?
Under the water. Like…
Like quiet.
Like being held.
No distractions.
Just water flowing around you.
Very quiet,
like a big,
blue silence.
Yeah.
I forgot your name.
My name is Joe.
I like you, Joe.
I like you too, Emily.
Would you like to come with us?
I'd love to.
He's stopping.
- I'm scared.
- Okay. All right.
- Take it easy, Emily. Just…
- I'm scared!
- Put your phone in your pocket.
- I'm scared.
And when he opens those doors,
you take that brick and you hit him
in the head as hard as you can.
- He deserves it.
- Oh God.
- He deserves it.
- That's right.
Now put your phone away.
- Put in your pocket.
- He was so angry.
- I know.
- He was so angry.
I know. I know. Emily, put the phone away.
- Oliver's fine. Oliver's fine.
- Just put the phone away when he opens...
Oliver's fine. He isn't even crying now.
What was that?
The snakes.
Snakes? What snakes?
He was in so much pain.
They were… in his stomach.
He kept crying
because he had snakes in his stomach.
And I just took them out.
I just took them out.
Was it… you?
He's… He's not crying anymore.
He's much, so much better.
He's fine, isn't he? Joe? 
Joe? Please tell me he's fine.
Please just tell me, Joe.
Hey, hey, hey!
He's gonna lock me up.
Get away from me! Stop it!
Hey, hey, hey!
Stop it!
Hello?
Hello? Are you there, Joe?
I think there's something wrong
with my phone. Hang on.
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.
I think I found something.
They went to court over custody.
Henry has letters from a lawyer.
Looks like he lost visitation rights.
It's about his criminal record
and his sentences for assault.
No fucking wonder.
Joe?
Joe?
Yeah? Yeah?
Sorry, I'll get to the point.
The only thing from San Bernardino are
unpaid bills from Patton State Hospital.
Uh, she was a patient there.
Joe?
Patton State Psychiatric Treatment Center.
Does that help any?
She doesn't want to be locked up.
What was that?
She doesn't want to be locked up.
- God. Shit.
- You lost me there, brother.
Joe?
- Henry?
- Hello?
{\an8}Joe from LAPD.
Are you at… Are you at Patton?
- The State Hospital?
- Oh. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, uh, where is Emily?
- God.
Uh, I don't know. I think she hit me.
Okay, I'll send help.
- Do you need an ambulance?
- No, no, no.
- No police.
- Henry, I have to.
- I have to.
- God, I haven't done anything, man.
No.
I know. I know.
Why didn't you tell me?
You should have just called the police
and let us take care of Emily.
- Why?
- I wanna help her.
Huh?
- You wanna help her? Fuck.
- Yes, that is my job.
Let me tell you something. Nobody helps.
We get doctors, lawyers, social workers.
Nobody helps, just fucking nobody.
You trying to tell me
a cop's gonna help me? 
I'm trying to help.
Oh yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you!
She killed my son.
Killed my son. My son.
My son is dead.
Last November…
we, uh…
Discount ran out, man.
We said we'd try,
that we'd try to do it without her meds.
Oh my God! Oh my God!
I couldn't pay for them,
you know, like, because I…
Oh my God.
Henry? What are you doing?
Oh my God, Abby.
I should never have left her.
No, no. Henry,
the police are with her. Hen… Hen…
Henry. Henry, I'm gonna
need you to try and calm down.
She's just a little baby…
just a little baby girl.
I told her not to go in there.
Oh my God. I need to get Abby.
No, Henry. Henry, listen to me.
Henry, the police have her.
The police. She is safe. She is safe.
She is fine. She is fine.
- Where is Emily? We have to find Emily.
- I don't know.
- Henry?
- I don't know where she is.
Henry, do you think
that she could harm herself?
I don't know.
I don't know. Listen. Just listen.
Listen to me. Okay? Listen.
She has no idea what she's done.
She… she thinks… Oh my God.
She thinks that she helped Oliver.
I didn't have
the heart to tell her that she…
Oh God, she wasn't always like this.
She's just sick.
And I just…
I needed to help her. She's just…
Henry?
This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…
No.
Joe? Joe?
We have a caller who wants to talk to you.
What?
A caller wants to talk to you.
She says you talked before.
- Her name is Emily...
- No. What? Where is she?
Yes, now! Now, man!
- Now!
- What happened here?
- Just put her through!
- I'll patch her through.
Emily?
Is that you, Joe?
Yes, Emily, I'm here.
Where are you?
I'm gonna go find Oliver and Abby.
I'm gonna take them to the aquarium.
No, no, no. No, no, no.
We'll show you the turtles.
Oliver loves the turtles.
No, you're not…
You're not gonna find Oliver.
Oliver's not there.
Emily. Emily, I need you…
- He's better now.
- Emily, I need you to look around you.
Okay? Where are you?
Where are you? I hear cars.
Uh… Uh… Can you see what's around you?
I…
I see…
I see…
What? Emily?
Cars.
What is this?
I…
- I have blood on my hands and my shirt.
- Emily.
- Where? I have blood on my hands.
- Emily, Emily, okay.
- I can see in the light.
- Listen.
- Listen to me.
- I have blood on me.
- It's okay.
- Where is this from?
It's not yours. Okay. Just look up.
Okay? Look up and tell me where you are.
What can you see? I hear cars.
Is that… Is that right?
Are there cars nearby?
Way down below.
What, the cars are?
Emily, are you on the freeway?
Are you… Are you on the overpass?
- Joe.
- Emily.
Joe, is it Henry's blood?
Joe, is it Henry's blood?
No, Henry's okay.
If this isn't my blood then,
Joe, whose blood is this?
No, Emily…
- Whose blood is this? Whose blood is this?
- Emily. Emily.
Tell me where you are
so I can send someone to help you.
- This isn't my blood.
- Emily, just tell me where you are.
- Emily. Please, listen to me.
- What did I do, Joe?
- Emily, please.
- Oh my God.
No. Is this Henry's blood?
Is this Henry's?
Hey, call CHP dispatch now!
I know. Henry knows. Henry knows.
Tell them it's Joe!
Tell them I have
the abducted woman on the 210 overpass.
Dispatch now. Now!
Emily? I'm here.
- I know. I know.
- What did I do?
- I know.
- You have to tell them I didn't mean it.
No, Henry knows. Henry knows.
He was just trying to help you.
We were all just trying to help you.
We're all just trying to help you. Just…
You said that he deserved it, Joe.
I was wrong.
It's my… It's my fault.
It's my fault, Emily.
It's my fault that you're on the overpass.
Okay? Just please,
please don't do anything stupid.
Do you understand? Please.
There are people who love you.
Okay? Abby… Abby loves you.
Abby needs you.
Okay? Abby is waiting
for you to come home.
Just please, Emily,
please just talk to me.
- Talk to me.
- I'm gonna go now.
- I'm gonna go be with Oliver.
- No.
Joe, I'm gonna go be with Oliver.
I killed a man.
Do you hear me? I… I killed a man.
Do you hear me?
I killed a man. A boy actually.
Nineteen years old.
Joseph. Still… still a boy.
 Why? Why?
- Why?
- I don't… I… I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know because I… I could.
I just wanted to punish him.
I wanted to punish him
because I was angry.
I'm just so, I'm so angry,
and I… I… I just…
He… he… he did something
and he hurt someone.
He didn't… Did he hurt someone?
Uh, he… I don't know.
He hurt someone. Just please.
Uh, my… My… My…
My dad…
Uh…
Just please. I can't kill you, too, Emily.
I can't kill you too.
Joe?
Why?
Was it snakes?
Yeah.
Yes, it was snakes.
Just, I…
I promised Abby
that you would come home.
I promised her that you would come home.
- She needs you.
- Abby.
- Abby.
- Yes.
Please, I promised her. And so does Henry.
You have people who love you.
Please. Please.
Please, Emily.
Joe. Joe.
Yes?
I see the lights.
Okay, Emily, just…
go over to the officers.
I'm gonna go now.
Just go over to the officers.
I'm gonna go be with Oliver, Joe.
Emily?
This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…
Stop it.
Leave me a message,
call later, or send a text. Bye.
No.
This is Emily Lighton.
I can't come to the phone right now, so…
Stop it.
Leave me a message…
- California Highway Patrol.
- It's Joe.
We have her. She came down.
Wait. What? You… you…
Mm-hmm.
We have her. I'm on with the officers now.
She came down off the overpass.
We got her.
Good job, Baylor.
Oh, uh…
You got a message from Tim Geraci.
- Who?
- The officer who went to the Lighton home.
He wanted you to know the baby
is in the ICU at St. Helen's.
Sorry, what?
The baby is in the ICU at St. Helen's.
- Oliver?
- Yeah, I guess.
- He's alive?
- Yeah.
Broken people save broken people.
Hello.
Hey, partner.
- You find her?
- Yeah.
That's good. 
Are you home?
No. I'm in my car.
Thought you might need me.
Go home.
I think I'm gonna shower at the station.
Go straight to the courthouse from there.
You okay?
Hey, what's up, man?
Joe, you good?
You there?
Just tell… tell them what you saw, Rick.
Today in court.
Joe, we… we have a plan.
Just tell them the truth.
Just tell them the truth. Tell them…
What, Joe?
What the fuck are you talking about?
I can't change my statement.
You can.
No, I can't. I can't. They'll burn you.
We stick to our story.
I can't… I can't fucking change it, man.
Rick.
I need you to give me your word.
Joe.
Give me your word.
Joe, brother.
It's okay, Rick.
You won't see your daughter
for years, man.
I'll talk to you… I'll talk to you soon.
All right?
This is the Los Angeles Times.
How can I direct your call?
Can you connect me to Katherine Harbor?
Yes, sir.
Katherine Harbor. Yes.
I'll connect you now.
Good morning. It's Katherine.
This is Joe.
