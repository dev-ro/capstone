Aww...
Watch it! Watch it!
Frank, no!
I told you not to do that.
Spare any change?
I'm sorry, man,
I don't have any money.
Yeah, right.
Whoa! Sorry, bro.
Watch it, man.
- Stop global warming?
- So sorry, no speak-a Engrish.
- Okay.
- So sorry.
Shut up!
- She's back?
- Out!
I'm not sleeping in my car again.
It smells like Hot Pockets and feet.
- Get out!
- I just want clean underwear!
It's my room too.
Oh, my God. Answer me, Ryan.
Oh, my God. Answer me, Ryan.
What?
Oh, my God, you gotta
get here right now, man!
...creepy. Oh, my God.
You're not gonna believe this!
Fool, I understood 2% of that.
Dude, just come now!
Where?
Dude. Dude.
What?
You need to get
in here right now.
- This better be good, man.
- It is.
Whoa!
Right?
.7 millinewtons of energy?
God, that's-that's like huge.
When?
Yesterday, 12:01 a.m.
Damn, this is crazy, man.
Yeah, but Ryan, we have no idea
what set the device off.
Like, lab was locked.
It's almost like it
decided to fire on its own.
That's it! I've had it!
Oh, shit.
Hey, where you guys going?
- It's churro day at the cafeteria.
- Nom nom.
Dean Bronson, hi.
Love the tie. Are those cats?
Turkish Angora.
D-Don't change the subject!
- What subject?
- That!
We've had four
rolling blackouts,
fried electrical circuits,
broken bulbs all over campus,
and it's all because of
your little science project.
It's my thesis project.
It's an abject failure.
This university's
Science Department
prides itself on pioneering,
forward-thinking ideas
that yield results.
Results that lead to patents.
Do you see how it works?
So, it's just about money?
Yes, Mr. Phan, I hate to
shatter your illusions.
But somebody has to keep
the lights on around here.
Something you seem
hell-bent on stopping.
Literally!
Consider this joke of a project
suspended effective immediately.
- What?
- That's right.
- I've already called Professor 'Boner'.
- It's pronounced 'Bonner'.
And he's in total
agreement with my request.
I'm sending security to
come and collect this
energy-sucking
doohickey by 6:00 today.
- You can't just take her!
- Watch me.
I suggest you wrap up whatever
business you have left here.
Capiche?
Hello?
Hey, shitbags!
While you're out playing games,
our project got shot down.
I hope you're happy.
What is wrong with you?
Why are you sneaking up on me?
I was bringing you a...
Well, now it's covered
in bacteria, so
that's two dollars wasted.
So ungrateful.
Ah!
Frank, no!
Ow!
Dude, what's your problem?
I'm so sorry, man, I...
So sorry.
Dick.
Sorry, bro.
Shut up!
Out!
Ryan.
Dude.
I am trippin' right now.
Yeah, no shit.
No, no, seriously.
I'm having that thing, you know?
What's it called?
When you felt like you already
lived through something before.
Deja vu?
Yes, that.
I felt like I've totally lived
through this day already.
Oh, my God, answer me, Ryan.
Oh, my God, you gotta
get here right now, man.
Creepy, oh, my God...
I gotta call you back.
Okay, just breathe.
Just breathe.
Listen to me.
The day reset when
you died, right?
Yeah, some psycho dude in
a baby mask attacked me.
But it was just a dream, right?
- Tombs is dead.
- So is Lori.
Then who's the killer this time?
Uh, hello?
Will someone please explain to
me what the hell is going on?
Okay, recap.
So I was stuck reliving the same
day, Monday, the 18th
over and over and over again
until someone wearing
a Bayfield baby mask
murdered me on the
night of my birthday.
I had no idea who it was
because I was such a crazy bitch.
And so many people hated my guts.
So, at Carter's suggestion,
I made a list of suspects.
Turns out,
it was my roommate Lori
who kept on helping a serial
killer escape from the hospital
hoping it would look
like he murdered me
when in fact,
it was her all along
and all because she was jealous
of an affair I was having
with my college professor,
Gregory, who was married.
Yup, I know, pretty shitty.
But anyways,
I finally kicked Lori's
crazy ass out a window
and killed her
which broke the loop
or so I thought
but now it only looks like
I passed the loop onto you
and you're gonna be
stuck reliving this day
until we figure
out how to stop it?
Of course.
I'm still dreaming.
Wait, what?
It's like Inception.
It's a dream
within a dream.
Bro, you're not dreaming.
- Ryan, what...
- Shhh.
I'm trying to wake myself up.
There, see, you're not dreaming.
Why'd you hit my penis?
Why you acting like this?
You smacked my dick.
- That's rude.
- I barely touched you.
Okay.
Show me where you died.
Back there, storage closet.
Hey, gimme that.
I can handle myself.
You've died enough, haven't you?
Mmm.
Bash his head in.
Shhh.
Samar, you asshole!
Why'd you hit me?
Why do you keep
sneaking up on me?
Oh, I think my cheekbone's broken.
What is happening in here?
Ryan broke my cheekbone.
Was it him?
No.
He was here when I died before.
What?
Where'd you get that mask?
It was just laying in the hallway,
somebody must've dropped it.
That's it! I've had it!
W-Wait! Where you going?
- Uh, churro day at the cafeteria.
- Nom nom.
We've had four
rolling blackouts,
fried electrical circuits,
broken bulbs all over campus,
and it's all because of
your little science project!
Wait.
What science project?
The Sisyphus Quantum
Cooling Reactor.
We call it Sissy for short.
You see all these?
They're proton lasers.
And when they fire,
they go to the
centrifuge right here
to almost below one nanokelvin.
So basically,
we're trying to prove that
time can be slowed down
on a molecular level.
It hasn't worked yet,
but we did find
some promising data
after the device
fired the other night.
When?
12:01 a.m. yesterday.
Monday, the 18th.
Mm-hmm.
What?
You created the time loop, dummy.
That's impossible.
That's not what Sissy
was designed to do.
I don't know what to tell you.
Well, maybe we're just
discovering what it actually does.
An unintended reaction.
Maybe we thought we
were slowing time,
but what if we
looped it instead?
Now, you're stuck in this day.
Congrats.
Oh, and by the way,
you're gonna die
again,
and again, and again.
Carter, tell your girlfriend
to stop trying to scare me.
Oh, she's not my girlfriend.
Oh, wait, are you my girlfriend?
Kinda.
Hey guys, are you done talking
'bout your relationship status?
Because she just said
I'm gonna die.
Then you need to figure
out how to close the loop
before the killer
finds you again.
But I don't know
how it happened.
It just... fired on its own.
Oh, God.
Danielle, hi.
- Where were you?
- What do you mean?
You ditched our house meeting.
It was canceled.
When?
Um, after I kicked my murdering
roommate out of a window.
Exactly.
Who's gonna pledge Kappa,
now that we have a death curse?
We're in crisis mode, Tree.
Ew.
Who are these people?
Hi. Uh, I-I'm Samar.
Hey, Samosa,
my head's the middle one.
Anywhoo,
call me as soon as
you're done with your
creepy little Comic-Con meeting.
Ugh.
- Did she just call me samosa?
- Yup.
- You think she likes those?
- Nope.
Guys, focus.
I don't wanna die.
On the bright side,
you'll come back.
I died 11 times.
11? Hell, no.
That shit hurts.
Wait a minute.
Guys, I have an idea.
We just need to find the
safest possible place
and wait it out there.
Where?
What?
There's
safety in numbers.
More like hiding in plain sight.
Who picks a creepy baby
as a mascot, anyway?
I knew I should've gone to MIT.
Is that you and your mom?
That's cute.
You know, I was thinking,
it's ironic.
Here, I thought I was
stuck in the same day
for some big cosmic reason,
for facing my mom's death.
But it had nothing to do with her.
Turns out it was just
some big scientific fluke.
That doesn't make it
mean any less, does it?
Guess not.
You got a little somethin' there.
Yup.
Yeah.
Sorry.
You're such a grandpa.
Well, you fell for it, so.
Please make your way
to the nearest exit
in an orderly fashion.
This is not a drill.
Please make your way
to the nearest exit
in an orderly fashion.
This is not a drill.
Guys!
Wait up!
Don't push me!
Help! Help! Please!
Help!
What was that?
Down here!
Oh, shit!
You okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Well, damn. Good job.
I've had a little practice.
What the hell?
I thought you were the killer.
You shoulda said something!
I was looking for you.
Well, who is it?
Only one way to find out.
What the fuck?
You sure you-you
don't have a twin brother?
Maybe you were
separated at birth.
Of course, I'm sure.
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit is right.
Who are you?
Who you think I am, dummy?
It's you.
- Duh.
- Duh.
What the hell is going on here?
Look, I was trying
to close the loop
but somehow I got knocked
into a parallel time loop.
We're all in serious danger.
The longer we exist
in the same dimension,
the worse things will get.
It's a butterfly effect.
You have to kill him!
Me?
He's going to create
bigger problems
if you do not stop him.
Kill him, now!
No, screw that. Kill him.
You're wasting your time.
Do it!
Dude, I'm your friend,
not him.
You know what, screw this.
I'll just take care of it myself.
Stop him!
Wait, Ryan, maybe
you should stop.
Look at him, he's crazy.
I'm the one who designed this.
I know what I'm doing.
You don't understand
what you're doing!
Shut up, fake Ryan!
Ryan, this doesn't feel right.
Ryan, stop!
But a parsec is a measure of
distance, not time.
Okay, so now you're gonna
call Han Solo a liar?
No, see a normal Kessel Run...
Dre, help me!
Come on!
Whoa.
Dude, did you dose
my Yoo-hoo again?
What did I tell you about
turning that thing on?
Turn it off now!
Turn it off now!
Just get him, get the man,
get him!
Back up!
Ryan, just turn it off, man!
Ryan, what are you doing?
Guys, take the wrench from him,
he's a failing student!
Get the wrench!
Don't be scared of him!
Just unplug it!
Unplug the machine!
Unplug it!
Whoa!
Shut up!
Oh, hey, you're up.
I wasn't sure if you wanna
sleep in or not, so I...
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪
Tree?
No
fucking way.
Hey, I folded you clothes for you.
Ryan, get in here right now!
Wait a minute,
you two know each other?
- No.
- Yes!
Ryan, you dumbass!
You sent me back!
- What?
- It's Monday, the 18th!
I don't believe this.
I just got out. How could you
do this to me?
Uh, who's this crazy white girl?
Maybe it was a bad dream
or somethin'.
You're right, it is a bad dream.
It's a nightmare!
This sucks!
It sucks the biggest megaballs
in the history of
shitty ball suckery!
I'm okay.
- You sure?
- Yes.
He just needs to fix this now.
This is a joke, right?
Oh... I wish.
Ryan, we need to go to your lab,
turn on Sissy and figure out
how to send me back!
Uh, how'd you know about Sissy?
Oh, my God, just...
Let's go.
Andale, people!
Hey! Stop global warming?
A simple "no, thanks" would do!
Sorry!
Same day, same day,
same day, same day!
I can't hear you!
Take one down, pass it around.
Keep going!
Hey, you haven't returned...
You are gay.
Wait, where you going?
The lab's back that way.
I have some business
to take care of first.
You sneaky little biotch.
That's weird.
What?
She was supposed to be here.
Who?
Uh, never mind.
She finally rolls in.
Where is it?
Where's what?
- Oh, hey, Carter.
- Hey.
- Where's the cupcake?
- What cupcake?
The one you made
for my birthday.
The one you poisoned.
Oh, that cupcake.
I'm serious.
Look, I don't know what stupid
joke Danielle put you up to,
but there's no cupcake.
Sorry.
I gotta go.
Pulling a double for Jen.
She's got the flu.
Happy birthday, though.
Toodles!
Something's wrong.
What?
I don't know.
It's different.
There were two of me?
Yes.
That is how this
whole thing happened.
You know, this kinda reminds
me of Back to the Future II.
- Totally.
- Right?
Mm-hmm.
With Marty McFly?
Doc?
The DeLorean?
Sorry.
Are you serious? You've never
seen Back to the Future?
No, I...
- How do you...
- Wait.
Oh, my God.
Does this mean that...
Does this mean that
there are two of me?
I highly doubt it.
It's almost impossible to
create a holographic universe.
You're probably stuck in a
quantum cyclic dimension.
There's only one of you here
because the other you
got knocked into
a parallel dimension
somewhere in the multiverse.
Okay, Ryan,
thanks for clearing that up.
That was super helpful.
You've never heard of
the multiverse theory?
Do I look like someone who
knows what a multiverse is?
Okay, look,
this is our universe.
Okay, but look...
In theory, the universe
has six dimensions.
Now, if what you're
saying is true,
then maybe you woke up
on the same day,
but not in the same dimension.
That would explain the anomalies.
So, how different
are we talking here?
Well, it depends.
Oh, shit, I forgot
our house meeting.
Danielle, I'm sorry, I just...
Hey, babe.
You doin' alright?
Hi, Ry.
Hey, Danielle.
Did that look real?
I'm auditioning for this year's
production of The Miracle Worker.
Did you know
Anne Frank was blind
and deaf?
Um, Helen Keller.
Excuse me?
Anne Frank was in the attic.
Oh.
Whatever.
All I know
is acting blind
is probably harder than
actually being blind.
I mean, the skill set it takes...
Meryl Streep taped her eyelids
shut just to prepare for a role.
Uh-huh.
Well.
Somebody missed our
house meeting today.
Oh, um...
- I'm sorry, I...
- Totes kidding.
Birthday girls get a free pass.
Anywhoo, we picked
this year's charity.
Are you ready for it?
We're doing the special needs
art fair again.
Nice.
You do so much good, Danielle.
I-I really admire that.
Oh, please.
It just warms my heart seeing
all those little faces.
I mean, don't get me wrong,
sometimes they try to
hug you too long
and it gets a little uncomfortable.
But you just get used to it.
And at the end of the day,
there is no greater gift in life
than the love of a child.
Thank you.
Tree?
You okay?
Uh...
Yeah, I...
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪
♪ And I ain't gotta
pick up the phone ♪
Hey, Dad, um...
Uh, yeah, yeah, sorry.
I'm on my way.
I'll be there in a little bit.
I have to go, um...
Wait, what, you're leaving?
Uh, yeah, I have to meet up
with my dad for lunch. It's a
birthday thing.
Meet me in the lab at 3:00.
We are figuring this out
before it gets any worse!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay, sweetie.
It's just been a weird day.
Everything okay?
Uh, yeah, it's just
stuff, you know?
How's school?
Um, it's fine, Dad.
- Are you ready to order?
- Not yet.
We're still waiting on one more.
One more? I...
Okay, I'll be right back.
Mom?
Mom!
Whoa!
Hi.
You're here.
Are you really here?
Well, of course, I'm here.
It's our day.
Are you okay?
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh, God, I'm fine, I'm just...
It's good to see you.
Okay.
Try it now.
20 seconds.
Yo, is this normal?
Don't worry, it's not
gonna blow up again.
- Again?
- Ten.
Nine.
Eight.
Seven.
Six.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two!
Stop!
Leave it.
- You told me to...
- No, I-I know, I changed my mind.
This must be the crazy white girl.
Hey, Tree, wait up.
Hey.
Why the change of heart?
Everything's different.
Different, how?
Wait, when were you
gonna tell me?
Tell you what?
About Danielle.
What about Danielle?
Apparently, you guys are dating.
Wait, I thought-
I thought you knew that.
I mean, you guys live
in the same house.
Uh, no, I definitely
didn't know.
But the bigger question is,
does she know?
Does she know what?
One of her closest friends
woke up in your bed this morning.
You don't think that
that's newsworthy?
Nothing happened.
I slept in Ryan's bed last night.
So why take me home?
Because you were-
you were wasted.
I was afraid you were
gonna fall or
choke on your own vomit,
like Janis Joplin.
Ugh!
Okay.
It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.
It's fine, this is how
it's supposed to be.
My mom's okay, Lori isn't
trying to kill me.
I mean, this is like the better
version of my life, right?
What are you...?
Wait a minute... In this...
- In this other dimension, are we...
- I...
I can't do this right now.
No...
Tree!
It's all good.
And...
Oh, my God!
That's so weird.
I want to see the menu.
I don't think we have
to get another one.
None of these memories are mine.
I know.
I'm just borrowing it for tonight.
What time are you
going to the party?
Um...
I, uh, I can't make it.
Something came up.
What?
I mean...
We've been planning this for
weeks, Tree.
No, I know.
I know it's a surprise party.
I'm sorry, it's just...
You know, my parents are
in town and I need to...
Ugh.
Our tuition dollars at work.
Anywhoo,
who told you about the surprise?
Was it Lori?
I swear, that girl really needs
to learn how to keep a secret.
I don't know what's going on...
You know what, Tree, I'm just
gonna come out and say it.
I have been feeling so extremely
unappreciated by you.
- That left on officer dead.
- Hello?
I'm still talking to you.
This is why I feel so...
A nationwide manhunt that ended
after a five-month pursuit
across four state lines
that left six people dead...
Oh, my God.
He's still here.
He's going to escape!
Call the police!
- Who?
- John Tombs! Just call the police!
What?
Wait! Don't go in there!
Shit!
What are you doing?
Whoa.
- Drop the axe.
- Wait, I can...
Drop it now.
He's escaped,
he's gonna kill someone.
Face up against the wall.
No, you don't understand, Lori...
I'm not askin' again!
Please. Listen to me.
My roommate works here.
She set Tombs free because
she's trying to blame him.
But she's gonna kill me!
Don't know what kinda
shit you're on, lady,
but Tombs is down at the OR right
now, nurse just took him.
Was she tall, dark hair
in a ponytail?
Ow!
I know you think I'm crazy,
but you've gotta believe me!
Dispatch, this is Officer Monroe.
Have an 1155 at hospital,
need immediate assistance.
I know it's you, Lori!
Oh, my God.
I thought you were dead.
Oh, my God, are you okay?
What the hell's going on?
Who was that?
Tombs escaped,
he's trying to kill me.
No, Tree, that's not possible.
I just took him down to the OR.
- What's happening?
- I-I don't know.
Oh, my God, he cut the power.
Just stay calm.
Stay calm.
Shit!
Okay, come on.
Come on.
Where the hell are we?
This must be one of the floors
under construction.
Come on, there's an emergency
exit on the other end.
Wait.
Where then?
Okay.
Come on.
What?
Did you hear something?
All right, asshole,
let's see what you got.
Ha!
Shit!
Aaah!
Shut up!
Dorky move, Tree.
Oh, hey, you're up.
What dimension am I in?
Huh?
Danielle.
My girlfriend?
Uck... same one.
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪
Okay.
♪ And I ain't gotta
pick up the ph... ♪
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm never better.
I... folded your clothes for you.
Look, no offense,
but how could you
possibly end up with her?
With who?
Danielle.
Uh, she's nice.
Oh, nice. Pkkf.
Wait a minute, isn't she like,
your best friend?
You hit the fine vagine, or what?
Huh... interesting.
Nah, I wasn't trying to do any...
Not as innocent as you look.
What? No, I... I...
You, meet me in your lab
in an hour.
Huh?
I've got to get out of
these disgusting clothes.
Listen to me carefully.
I need to stay here in
this dimension, okay?
So just close the loop.
Look, we have no idea how this
even happened in the first place.
Well, you're all brainy
science people, right?
So you'll figure it out.
You realize we're
messing with things
we have no business
touching, right?
Well, maybe you
shoulda thought of that
before you built
the big, dumb thing.
Just...
Just, please do me a favor
and try to figure this out.
Okay?
Please.
Look,
this is gonna be
a trial and error situation.
We have to rule
out every variable
in order to narrow down
the correct algorithm
that will close the loop.
Okay.
Uh, it's days,
maybe weeks of work.
And if what you're saying is true,
there's no way to keep
a record of our progress.
I'm not following.
Okay, um...
Say, we test, like
dozens of variables.
By the end of the day,
the loop will reset, right?
So everything we learnt,
gets...
erased.
There's no way for us
to track our progress
simply because we just don't
remember anything we learnt.
We'll be back to square one.
Great.
I'm screwed.
Wait, no, I got it.
You said everything resets
but your memory, right?
- Yeah.
- All right, well, then...
You're just gonna have to be
a living record.
Wait, you mean memorize everything?
Yeah.
That's genius.
- Yeah.
- No.
No, no, no, no.
That's not genius.
I'm not a scientist.
And, hello?
I mean, you do realize there's
a killer after me, right?
That means I'm gonna have to die
over and over again
until you guys figure out
how to close the loop.
I mean, I guess
you could just kill yourself
before they find you.
Wow.
Another genius idea.
Better than being chased by
some crazy guy in a baby mask.
I mean, do you have
a better idea?
Ugh.
I knew you were gonna say that.

Oh, hey, you're up.
"I wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not."
"I folded your clothes last night."
"I wasn't sure if that
material gets wrinkled."
Anyway, what the hell
are you always looking for
under that desk?
Oh, see, my mouthguard.
Yeah, I...
I grind my teeth at night.
Mystery solved.
♪ Yeah, it's my birthday ♪
Okay.
Ow.
You okay?
Yup, never better.
I don't know if you remember
my name or not.
You were uh...
You were pretty wasted last night.
- I'm Carter.
- Ow!
Hey, are you sure you're okay?
You're...
looking kind of pale.
I'm fine, I...
Mmm.
Actually, I'm probably
gonna pass out.
What?
Yup, definitely passing out.
You hit that fine
vagine, or what?
Is she dead?
- Ryan, a little help here, man.
- Okay.
Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's just me.
You okay?
You really gave me
scare back there.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
You still came.
Yeah, of course.
Why wouldn't I?
Oh, we got a
hold of your parents.
They're on their way.
No.
They can't come here.
It's not safe.
Jesus.
Can I help you?
Oh, it's okay.
He's a friend.
Sorry, visiting hours are over.
Oh. All right.
Thanks, Carter.
Feel better.
I guess now you know why
I wasn't in your class today.
Pardon?
Advanced Bio.
Uh, I'm sorry.
Are you in my class?
You don't look familiar.
I'm s-sorry, my mistake.
Right.
Well, I'm Dr. Butler.
Nice to meet you.
Ms. Gelbman,
I've been having a hard time
pulling up your medical records.
I know, I should be dead.
My results,
they don't make sense, right?
Yes.
They're highly alarming,
to be honest.
Wait...
What time is it?
Almost 9:30.
She's about to die.
- Who?
- Lori.
He's gonna kill her.
- What?
- Listen to me.
You need to stop her from
going down to the OR.
I'm sorry, I don't know who
you're talking about.
Oh, really? Well, maybe
your wife does.
Go! Go!
Sorry.
Lori.
Who set you free?
Who are you?
All right.
I go, you go.
Oh, hey, you're up.
Wasn't sure if you wanted
to sleep in or not.
Shut up!
I am so done with this shit.
Then you multiply
the Euclidean vector
by the square root of pi
to the 17th power
which then gives
us an axiom point
of .004
which then gives us a
linear plane vector of 8.2.
Boom.
Damn.
If these are all the
failed algorithms...
Then there's only
one possibility left.
- Holy shitballs.
- Oh!
- You did it!
- It worked?
- It worked?
- Oh!
Oh, my God! It worked!
I'm so excited!
We barely know her!
Honestly, I-I don't know
what just happened, but
that was impressive.
Thanks.
Let's do this.
Just so we're totally clear,
one variant closes the
loop in this dimension,
and the other one sends you
back to your original dimension
and closes that loop.
It's final decision time.
Stay here or go back.
I'm staying here.
Final decision.
Okay.
Here we go then.
Stand back.
What happened?
Oh, the vector's off.
You said this was the right one.
No, the math is right,
something else is off.
Guys, I have literally
been killing myself
to memorize this shit for you.
Failure's not an option.
What?
There's something
in hard drive.
Must be a virus.
Dude, did you open spamporn
again on the computer?
No!
Great. I have to manually
reenter all this code.
Okay, how long?
Six, seven hours.
Ryan, look at me.
I am on borrowed time here.
Understand?
Get it done.
Uh, yeah. I'm on it.
Tree, wait up!
Hey, are you sure about this?
Of course, I'm sure.
Okay, what about the killer?
I mean, you said people
are gonna die tonight.
If you close the loop
and we don't help,
then they're dead
for good, aren't they?
I have to stay alive.
I can't go back to that hospital.
It's way too risky.
Okay, so that's it?
You're just gonna walk away
and let a bunch of
innocent people die?
People die everyday, Carter.
I can't be responsible for
everyone, okay?
I know how selfish that sounds,
but it's true.
Yeah. No, that sounds
incredibly selfish.
Are you serious?
That's not fair.
You have no idea how
hard this is for me.
I don't wanna have to choose
between you and my mom
but I have to.
What do you mean choose?
Carter, we're together
in the other dimension.
I woke up in your
bed every morning
just like this morning.
I did it over and over
and over again until
I fell in love with you.
My bad version of
this is back there
and my mom is alive here.
So, I've made my decision.
What if you're wrong?
What if you're wrong?
What if this isn't the life
that y-you're supposed to have?
So what?
I'm just supposed to go
back to some dimension
where my mom's dead?
I can't.
I can't lose her again.
You already did.
And none of this is real
if it erases that.
You're just...
You're living someone else's
life that doesn't belong to you.
It's your pain, that loss...
That's...
That's what makes you you.
When you have the
chance to do something
other people only dream of.
What?
You could say goodbye.
Hoo-hoo.
Your girlfriend's calling you.
You better go.
What's her problem?
She just ditched
our house meeting.
Hello?
What were you guys
talking about?
Nothing. We were just...
We were going over school stuff.
Babe, don't forget.
I still need help with
my American Lit paper.
I'm... I'm really busy right now.
Carter.
You promised.
I won't pass the class
without your help.
All right, y-yeah, that's fine.
You're the best.
There's the other birthday girl.
- Sweetie, what's wrong?
- I'm okay, I...
You don't look okay.
I'm okay, I... Mom!
You're cold as ice.
Maybe we should go to the hospital.
No!
No.
We can't go there.
Look, I don't wanna
freak you guys out, but
I need you guys far away
from campus as possible.
Theresa, what is going on?
Dad, please.
I promise to explain
everything later
but I need you to trust me.
Okay.
We'll go.
Let's go.
Come on.
Yeah.
Done!
Finally.
You guys ready?
Okay, let's close this
loop once and for all.
Hey...
You know what I'm
craving right now?
What?
You know those
giant cinnamon rolls
from that bakery in Morro Bay?
From our birthday last year?
You don't remember?
You ate two of them!
That wasn't me.
What, sweetie?
Hey, girls, it's gettin' kinda late.
What do you say we find some
place, turn in for the night?
Okay, sounds good.
I think we're all pretty pooped.
Lori!
Shit.
Aaah!
No, don't shoot! Don't shoot!
Hey, girls, I'm gonna go get
some ice. Be right back.
Okay.
Just tell me one thing.
Are you pregnant?
What?
No! Mom, I...
Okay, sorry. I just had to ask.
It's not like that.
But it's a boy, isn't it?
No.
Yes.
I don't know. It's complicated.
Trust me.
I can do complicated.
What is it?
Have you ever wondered what
your life would've been like
if you couldn't be with Dad?
What? No.
What if you had to choose?
You know, what if...
What if being with him meant
that you would lose someone
that you were really close to,
that you would never see
that person ever again?
What would you do?
Well...
We all have to make hard
choices, Tree. That's life.
And sometimes the past is
pulling us in one direction and
the future is calling
us somewhere new.
But of course, if I had to
choose, I'd pick Daddy.
I mean, without him,
I wouldn't have you, right?
But how did you know
that he was the one?
I didn't.
I took a chance.
I followed my heart.
That's kinda how
love works, Tree.
It's a leap of faith.
Bayfield University hospital
where a terrible tragedy
continues to unfold.
Details are still coming in,
but so far,
we can confirm three victims:
A nurse and a police officer.
The third victim, a student
was killed while attempting
to subdue the suspect.
Back to you, Dave.
No.
What's wrong?
Come on, Ryan, come on.
Hey, Samar, can you check
22, 97, 39 right there?
Oh, yeah, will do.
You know the
vector's readjusted?
Yo, it's Ryan, leave a message
at the beeep!
Ryan, don't close the loop.
You can't...
- I'm sorry, this voice mailbox is...
- Shit!
Tree, what is going on?
I can't let him close it.
You know, I'm not sure
about this ice,
kinda smells like pee.
Tree! Tree!
Where are you going?
Tree!
Come on, come on,
pick up your phone!
- Yo, it's Ryan...
- Shit!
Here we go!
Where is it?
Come on, come on!
Oh, my God, please!
Aaaah!
Oh, hey, you're up.
Shut up!
I wasn't sure if you
wanted to sleep in or not.
That is the last time
I'm dying for you.
What?
How much longer
is it gonna take?
Thanks to your crazy memory,
it shouldn't take long at all.
I can have Sissy ready to go
in just a few minutes.
I need a little more time.
There's something I need to do.
Tree.
You sure you wanna go back?
Can't spend my life
living in the past.
Gotta take a leap of faith.
She finally rolls in.
Um, Lori, hi.
- Big night?
- Mm, you could say that.
Um...
Look, Lori, I...
It's good to see you.
Wha-?
It's good to see you too, Tree.
He's not worth it.
I mean, trust me.
I've been involved
with a married guy.
I know what's like
living a double life,
always feeling like shit
about yourself.
But it's never too late to change.
Well, someone once told me that
every day is a chance
to be someone better.
Maybe this is your day.
Okay.
Thank you.
Take care of yourself.
Tree.
Hey,
um...
Look, Danielle,
I feel really bad.
I've totally been misjudging you
and it's completely on me.
I'm so sorry that I've, like
made this...
Nice.
A threeway.
He's kidding.
No, I'm-I'm not.
Nick's, um, shower
was broken, so I said
he could use mine.
Right, Nick?
My shower's fine.
Right.
Um, you know what?
Never mind.
Sorry for interrupting.
Byeee.
Byeee.
Ow!
What was that for?
For being dumb as a rock,
that's what.
Oh, really?
How can rock be dumb?
The don't even have brains.
Ouch.
There's the other birthday girl.
Hey, Dad.
Um...
Do you mind if I talked to
Mom alone for a minute?
- Just some girl talk.
- Oh.
Well, sure.
I can go over some work calls.
Thanks.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, it's fine.
Everything's fine.
Oh, shit, how do I do this?
Do what, sweetie?
What's wrong?
Mom.
I really want you to know
how much I love you.
Aww, I love you too, sweetie.
No, Mom, I'm serious.
You know, people say
"I love you" all the time, but
it's not until you can't say it
to that person's face anymore
that you really realize
how much you mean it.
You are so beautiful
and so amazing.
And I just hope I can become
half of the woman
that you are one day.
Are you kidding?
I'm the woman I am
because I had you.
You know, I never really
told anyone this before, but
when I was pregnant with you,
I was scared shitless.
- No!
- But then,
the moment I held you,
something inside of me changed.
Instantly.
The best kind of love does that.
It changes you.
It make you a better person.
God, I'm so stupid.
I really thought I could
have it all, but I cant.
Honey, nobody can.
But guess what?
That's okay.
You'll get what you need.
I hope so.
Aww, come here.
Am I crushing you?
Nope.
You're always gonna be
my little girl.
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Make a wish.
You ready?
Wait.
Um...
Look...
I know this is probably
pretty confusing.
I mean,
you guys have only known
me for a couple of hours,
but I've known you for weeks.
You've all worked really,
really hard to try
to send me home.
So, thank you.
Well, jury's still out on whether
you're totally nuts, but uh...
Glad we could help.
Okay, Ryan, light her up.
S-So, in this other dimension,
do we...
Do we know each other?
You could say that.
17 seconds!
16,
15,
14,
What did I tell you about
turning that thing on?
Uh-oh.
This isn't supposed to happen yet.
You're not supposed
to come until tomorrow!
Turn that thing off now.
No, don't!
Please, you can't do this.
And who are you?
I am a student here.
Oh, well, keep this little
attitude up and we'll change that.
Get that thing outta here.
No, please, don't...
Hey, watch it, beefcake,
we spent 18 months on that!
Please, don't!
Don't manhandle her.
Taking our project.
Where are you taking her?
My office, where it will remain
under lock and key.
Okay, it's a setback.
I get it.
We just reset the day
and try again.
No.
You don't understand.
I keep getting weaker
every time I come back.
I don't know how many
chances I have left.
For all I know,
this could be it.
If I die again,
I could stay dead.
- Hm, that's a problem.
- No shit.
Unless...
Unless we steal it back.
Steal it?
Well, I mean, you know, it's not
even technically stealing, is it?
It's your property.
Whoa, whoa, guys.
I don't know about this.
Like, if we get caught
and I get expelled,
my parents are gonna hang me
- by the nutsack.
- I'm with him
except for the nutsack
part, obviously.
Are you kidding me?
No, I'm sorry to throw a bag of
dogshit on your front porch here,
but... this is all on you guys.
You created this mess,
so you're obligated
to help her out of it.
Besides, if she dies again tonight,
that's blood on your hands.
That's a little dramatic.
He's right.
This is our fault.
So we fix it.
That's what scientists do.
We solve the problem.
So, Dean Bronson's office
is in this building here
and the fastest route
back to the lab
is this path here.
And check this out, guys,
Dean Bronson spends
every evening knitting
in the faculty lounge, here.
Wait, what?
- He knits?
- I think he used to smoke
and then his wife made him quit
and, oh, by the way,
shockingly hot.
Samar.
Hmm?
Can we do the-the thing
we're doing right now?
Right, sorry. Um, okay.
So, we need to get
the keys to his office,
sneak over to Admissions,
break into the dean's office,
grab Sissy,
wheel her back to the lab
without anyone from
security seeing us,
get Dean Bronson's
keys back to him
without him ever
knowing they were gone,
power up Sissy,
run diagnostics,
flip the switch and bang!
Tree's back in whatever
whackass dimension she came from
and we, well...
we just saved the damn day.
Okay.
Sounds awesome.
How do we do that?
I don't know.
Ugh, of course.
Okay, well, we obviously
need a diversion.
So, we just gotta find a way
to distract Dean Bronson.

She picked the ringtone, all right?
Hey, babe.
Yeah. You okay?
With Ryan and...
Danielle, hi!
So, we have a
little favor to ask.
Suspect at best.
Let's just put our face in.
Hi, baby.
- Okay.
- Okay, sorry.
Clearly, she's a little on edge.
Mm-hmm. That's right.
Preach.
Can I help you?
Oh, perdon.
I appear to be, eh, very lost.
Roger Bronson, I'm the
dean of the school.
Oh, bonjour.
My name is eh...
Amerie... Le Pew.
Oh, you must be with
the exchange program.
Ah, oui, oui.
Monsieur, may I know your face?
I'm sorry?
Oh! My...
Oh, man.
What strong features.
Thank you.
You must be French.
Your hand smells like cheese.
I don't eat cheese.

Oh, you must mean the cafeteria.
I'm happy to show you. Here.

Marbles everywhere.
Go, go, go, go!
Oh!

- Oh!
- Oh, ho-ho!
Pretty quick there.
Hold on now,
just stay put, okay?
I just need to,
uh, grab my keys.
Whoo!
Oh! Not the tapestry!
Oh! Jeez!
It's so dark!
Move toward the light!
Sorry, that was insensitive.
- C'mon, c'mon, c'mon...
- I'm trying!
- Stop rolling.
You're not helping!
The other way.
- Sissy.
- Go, go!
Okay, here we go. Up, up.
Oh, God!
You really must stop
wandering around.
- Gracias.
- Okay, shall we?
Ah! Forgot my keys!
Ah!
Oh! God!
Oh, no, monsieur!
Oh, that's a lot of blood!
Jesus, be careful
with that thing!
I am so sorry!
I don't think the cane
is a good idea for you.
You need a seeing eye dog.
Checkmate.
- Hey, how's it going?
- We're on it.
Guys, we've got less than three
hours to make this happen.
I'm not gonna lie.
It's gonna be close.
Shit.
If I don't stop the killer,
Lori's gonna die.
- Stay here.
- What? Why?
Just promise me you'll stay here.
Can I borrow this?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Okay.
Wait, where are you going?
Tree!
Sorry. Bad timing.
Okay, okay.
Okay, you can put it away.
Come on, put it away.
Okay, now slowly turn around.
This is a really bad idea.
There's a killer
on the loose here.
Go get help.
- What?
- Go!
She's got a gun!
She's got a gun!
Lori, move!
- What?
- Come on, we've gotta move.
- What's happening?
- I'll explain later. Move!
What is this?
You're not blind!
Gonna kill them.
I'm... going... to kill them!
He's onto us.
Babe, can you all take
my sunglasses back?
I just got those.
Okay.
Get it open, now!
Bash it in!
Keep 'em out!
We're trying!
Get 'em open, now!
Oh, my God, if get expelled,
my parents are gonna disown me!
Tree, will you please
tell me what's going on?
At first, I thought he was
trying to kill me,
but it's you he's after.
Who?
It's over, Gregory.
What? Why?
His wife found out
about your affair.
So he stole a page from
your old playbook.
He set Tombs free knowing
that everyone would think
that he killed you.
The secret of you affair
would die with you.
Bravo.
Well, done, indeed.
Once a douchebag,
always a douchebag.
I'm sorry, do I know you?
Stay back, asshole!
Put your back into it!
Harder!
You guys gotta get back
into the gym, man.
Ryan! We can't hold 'em
much longer!
Come on, come on!
You hear that?
You're gonna rot in prison.
I don't think so.
You see, there's one little detail
you've failed to realize in all this.
Oh, really? What's that?
Me.
Lori!
You really think I was gonna let a
little whore like that ruin my life?
Gregory! Kill her!
Would you like to do the honors?
Don't mind if I do.
Oh, wait. I almost forgot.
I want a divorce.
Now, where were we?
Hey!
Aww.
Look who brought a
screwdriver
to a gunfight.
Wait!
Something I need to tell you.
What?
You're screwed.
Aaah!
Turn it off, you bitch!
No! No, no, no, no!
Wait!
There you go. I got ya.
I got ya.
You're fine.
Yup.
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
Guess this is a pretty good
place to get shot, huh?
I'll lift you up now.
- You're good.
- You're gonna be okay.
We have a crash cart.
I can't find the beeper.
Lori...
I'm so sorry.
For what?
You just saved my life.
I just...
I wish things
could have been different.
I'm sorry,
but we need to move her.
Hang in there.
Hey.
- Hey.
- You okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. I...
I thought I told you to stay put.
Yeah, well...
Sorry, couldn't help myself.
I think it's time.

This doesn't make any sense.
Yes, it does.
It acted like a slingshot.
When she jumped back
into this dimension,
the vacuum created by the
centrifugal force closed the loop.
Who throws away a
perfectly good churro?
Oh, no, don't.
Uh, oh.
This looks bad.

Uh, maybe.
I'm Dr. Isaac Parker.
I'm here on behalf of DARPA.
We'd appreciate it if you'd come

- All of you.
- Are we in trouble?
Please. Right this way.

Dr. Kalibato to Robotics.
Holy shit!
Sissy!
Hope you don't mind
us borrowing her.
What you've created here
is truly remarkable.
Suck it, Dean Bronson.
We've been having
some difficulties
understanding how
the device operates.
We figured you could help.
There are so many
different algorithms.
It'll be tough to find the
right one to make it work.
I might be able
to help with that.
Great.
So we just need to
find a test subject.
Wait, you...
You want to trap
somebody in a time loop?
Well, that's messed up.
Unless they deserve it.
I think I have the perfect recruit.
Aaaah!
