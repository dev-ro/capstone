Where the hell were you?
Hey, let's just drop your bags
off at the desk
and I'll run you right over
to the Grizzly...
Vernon, what's the fucking hurry?
We're not even playing
there until tomorrow.
You gotta meet X- ray
I told you.
He can wait for five minutes
can't he?
We don't want him
on our backs.
- So, why do I even bother coming...
- Vernon, please don't start that shit.
- He's not a bad guy.
- He won't pay us.
But it's an influential venue
and it has history...
We're just droping off the bags
We'll be back in an hour...
Excuse me...
Hey! Hey! Gotta meet the man!
Vernon, show them around.
I'll be yours in a minute.
Do you want a drink?
Beer?
Regarding the new stuff...
the best I can do is Crux.
They're pretty excited. There're this
new label out of Austin, Texas...
The advance is pretty much symbolic,
but I can get you a good percentage.
And what's their distribution?
Round Austin, at the back of
a van or something?
No, all over the continent
in alternative record stores.
And if it turns into a real...
if it really breaks out
there's nothing stopping them from
signing over to a major.
Hang on one second.
Wasn't I doing that deal?
Yes, you were supposed to be
three months ago.
I told you. I'm in discussions with
two major labels here.
Well, I think it's time we took
what we can get.
You're hocking Lee's music...
at bargain basement prices...
and you don't give a fuck...
I'm not hocking anything.
I'm being realistic, I'm being real world.
What do you mean by that
'the real world'?
Well, I mean as opposed
to some psychedelic
junkie fantasy world just
for instance...
I'm being straight with you.
Do you realize what this bullshit deal
will do to Lee's career?
It's as good as he's gonna get.
What? I can do better than that
in two phone calls.
Two phone calls! Really?
Be my guest! Make your fucking phone calls!
Go ahead, make your phone calls!...
It's not my fault
his reputation is shit.
- Are you trying to say that it's mine?
- Yeah, I am.
So keep out of my way or
I will slap you down.
You understand what I'm saying?
Vernon, you're going to regret this.
No, I don't think so
'cause you're not even here. Ok?
I don't even see you.
I don't talk to you.
I'm talking to Lee about
his life and his work
and his wife's ego is
his fucking problem.
Thank you.
We're Metric.
- I saw Lee.
- Yeah, he just left.
He can't wait five minutes?
He's with Emily.
It's my fault.
She pissed me off.
And I scared them away.
When is he going to get rid
of that woman?
Well, I don't know.
Maybe if he stops shooting up for a day.
It's not gonna happen
as long as he's with her.
She's a junkie to the bone.
That girl's a curse.
She's been bringing him
bad luck for five years now.
What's the kid's name?
I can't remember...
Jay... Jay?
Jay, it is.
Where is Jay?
Jay is in Vancouver
with Lee's parents...
What the hell are they doing
in Vancouver?
That's where they're from,
Lee's dad, they just moved back.
What's the point in having kids
if you just dump them?
Tell him you got
this number from Lewis.
Cheers.
- Is it working?
- No. It's not working.
- Oh how come?
- I don't know.
Try Hello. Yes...
Lewis gave me your number and...
Alright...
Hold on...
Yes, yes, yes...
Right... Go on...
I got that... I'll be there...
Now?
Like in fifteen minutes...
OKay, I'll be there... Bye.
- I'm just going out for a bit. Alright?
- Yeah... alright... See you.
- You got what you wanted?
- Yeah.
I didn't like the way you spoke
to Vernon you know.
You liked the way
he spoke to me?
No, I didn't,
but you know he's right, don't you?
Come on...I told you, I'm waiting for
Dreamworks to get back to me.
They don't give a shit
at Dreamworks.
Come on...
that little slut Susan,
she'll go down on you anytime
anywhere darling...
It's not Susan's decision who gets
signed to fuckin' Dreamworks, is it?
Then whose is it then?
I don't know who makes
the decisions.
I don't know anyone
there anymore.
How long ago did you send
her those tapes anyway?
I said how long ago?
- I don't know maybe like two months.
- Two months.
And you still can't figure out
why I had to get Vernon to sort it out.
Actually I don't.
If you want me to give it away
to some bullshit label I could
anytime no problem.
I think It's pretty bloody obvious now
that the problem is the record
it's not the fucking record label...
Where is the bottle opener?
Look... I'm 42. No one expects
anything from me anymore.
If I do something now
it's gotta be absolutely exceptional
or no one's gonna give a fuck.
And this record is anything
but exceptional.
It's just a lazy, shoddy
average piece of shit.
And right, I may be off my face
half the fucking time
but I know what I'm doing
you know.
And I've done better than this.
I fucking hope I have.
Well then do better again.
Look. What I'm saying is simple.
Maybe next year,
next week, next month
I'll do something better than this
but right now all I'm worth is this
pathetic little bunch of songs
just absolutely fucking nothing.
You think it's my fault?
It's my bad influence?
Why do you always think
everything's always based around you?
Did you read that article in Q?
Forget about it. Fucks.
I can't stand this shit anymore.
Did you see what they wrote about me?
How am I supposed to take that?
We've been through this
a million bloody times.
Do, yourself, and do me
a favor and
just forget about them for
five fuckin'minutes right?
If you want to talk about drugs,
let's talk about drugs.
That's all we ever talk about.
I was just trying to
talk about something else
for a fucking change.
You're just like Vernon
you think the minute
you get rid of me, everything
will be fine, right?
You're a fuckin' pain
in the ass, Emily.
I'm out of here.
I will leave in peace to make
your music to rebuild your career...
- alright?
- Do what you fucking like.
I couldn't care less.
Just leave me in peace.
Really do it.
No, No, You can't be in here.
Let go, let go! I'm his wife!
Let go!
I need to see some lD
please madame.
Alright...
Get back.
Stop.
Let go!
You've no right to do this!
- Mam
- Let go!
- Calm down
- Let go off me! You're hurting me!
You're hurting me!
Let go! No,no, no...
Please, madame.
Alright miss Wang...
You admit to knowing about
Lee Hauser's drug problem?
Yes.
Did you supply him with the heroin
he overdosed with?
No.
The heroin that you're caring on you
at the time of your arrest?
Where did you get it from?
I got it from Lee Hauser.
And where did he get it from?
I don't know.
Right. He died at 4 a.m.
Where were you then?
I was sleeping in a car
by the lake.
And did anybody see you there?
I don't think so.
Alright. Do you admit yourself
to be addicted to drugs?
Yeah.
And for how long have
you been using heroin?
Several years.
- How you doing?
- Hi.
We're looking for Mr. Hauser.
- He's on a boat over there.
- Thanks guys.
- You fellows'd like some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?
- We're fine, thanks.
Ok darling, here we go...
Albrecht! Show granpa...
Albrecht!
Are you okay?
What's wrong?
Come on darling,
get your knapsack...
I'll call you for afternoon tea.
And you finish the drawing for grandpa.
Rosemary...
Rosemary, No!
No! Rosy!
Hi.
The hotel clerk's deposition is
pretty much in your favor
he said he saw
you leave way before Lee died.
And you didn't provide the drugs.
If you plead guilty for possession,
you should get off pretty lightly.
Don't expect to go home tomorrow
Are you with me here?
Yeah... I'm not feeling too well.
I'm on methadone.
Hits you pretty hard off the top.
Does it get better?
Depends on the person.
Not for me.
What did the lawyer say?
Worst case, six months.
- And best case?
- Six months.
Oh and... yeah, I forgot to tell you...
I signed a contract for Lee's record.
He's obviously more interesting
dead than alive...
Plus he got a ton of press.
way more than I would have expected.
He was on the cover of Mojo.
Thanks for not sending it to me.
Well the general tone with regards to you
wasn't particularly flattering.
So I fielded a bunch of offers
and I accepted the most prestigious.
Of course, I'm joking...
I mean the most lucrative.
It will pay some debts...
and your lawyer's fees.
Thanks.
Don't thank me.
I did it for Lee.
You won't have to pay
for a thing.
And in return.
I don't want you to ask me
for anything ever again.
When I walk through this door
I no longer exist.
Just tell me this.
Were you there when he died?
No.
Have you been fighting?
Yes.
Did you buy the stuff?
No.
Six month later
Your keys. You can go off the door
to your left or to your right
to the right side of the building spot 5...
Thank you...
Here's your salad sir.
Everything over there
vinegar, salt and pepper, thank you.
Wouldn't you have prefered
somewhere more private?
I'm really grateful that you came.
You didn't have to.
I've been taking care of
Lee's unfinished business.
And it's... mostly debts
as you know.
I had to sell your apartment in London
to pay them off.
Of course, I had it emptied.
And...
the receipt of where
I put your things.
It's in your name.
And the address is right on it.
I'm not going back to London.
Not right now.
I'm going to go to Paris.
Is that where you lived
before you met Lee?
Yeah.
I have worked things out
with Barclay's.
And what was left of your joint account
is now in your name,
and your credit card is
working again.
How much is left in the account?
Well it's not much.
It's enough to pay your way back...
Maybe get by for a few weeks,
not much more.
- If you want, I can...
- No, thank you. I'm fine.
Hamburger half fries half
onions is ready.
I've been trying to work out
Lee's contracts the different record companies...
the different record companies...
the compilations...
but it's like reading algebra.
There's still a lot of unpublished stuff...
mostly from the late eighties.
There's this friend of Lee...
He's been very helpful... This fellow Tricky...
- He's famous.
- Yes, I've heard.
A huge star.
I don't know his music
but Lee liked him.
He's been faithful to their friendship.
It's very unusual.
Since Lee died, he...
I'm sorry,
it's hard for me...
Are you alright?
Yeah.
I'm taking methadone.
It's a heroin substitute.
I'm sure your lawyer told you.
The court handed down
its decision yesterday.
Jay is staying with us.
Father dead...
mother in prison...
No home, no job,
nothing.
Do you intend to appeal it?
No, of course not.
I can't take care
of him right now.
You see the motel sign...
It's right there.
Thanks for the ride.
You know your way back?
Well...
- More or less.
- More or less?
Well, don't get lost.
Emily... There's something
I'd like to ask you...
It's a bit delicate...
You see it was difficult to explain
his father's death to Jay.
I don't know what he thought
or what he felt. But...
He's a well adjusted boy
but he's sensitive. I'm scared...
I'd prefer if, for the next few years...,
you'd agree not to see him.
Rosemary and I have
done everything
we can to give him some kind
of stability.
A home... a sense of belonging...
And I'm afraid of unsettling him.
I understand.
Legally,
you have the right to see him.
But I think you should
give him some time.
We'll keep in touch.
Ifyou have any problems
we'll help.
Goodbye.
Paris, a few weeks later
Steamed duck.
Chicken saute.
Chicken curry.
White rice.
Enjoy your meal.
White rice?
All done?
Careful. Everyone knows.
They want to tell Mr. Li.
You'll get us all in trouble.
And with the pills
you're totally spaced out.
Fried noodles,
white rice,
stir-fried shrimp,
and Peking duck for two.
Another fried noodles.
I'm here.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I'm sick of this shitty job.
I couldn't get your prescription.
And I'm worried.
Alexis hasn't answered for 4 days.
I'm all out!
I know. And I told you
I'd do my best.
We better get going.
Who's she?
Aline. Alexis's ex-girlfriend.
She still has the keys to his place.
We haven't spoken in over a year.
This is a pain in the ass.
I tried before.
It's chained from inside.
See what I mean?
Don't bother. I already tried.
Allow me.
Let's clean up
then we'll call the cops.
Give me a trash bag.
- You should lay off that stuff.
- Fuck you.
It's none of my business.
It's your life.
- Are you coming or not?
- Watch your tone!
You asked me for a ride.
Now I have to help Aline.
What should I do?
Go sit and wait for the cops?
I can drop you off somewhere
or leave you here.
I don't need your help.
Do you pity me? I don't need pity.
Emily, just shut up.
You're only here
because I'm Lee's wife.
- Fuck off.
- Get lost! Get lost!
No need to say it twice.
Jean-Pierre!
Jean-Pierre!
What's going on with Tricky?
His manager is putting you
on the guest list.
Who the hell cares
about the guest list?
I want 5 minutes with him.
I know.
I'm waiting for an answer.
I need to talk to him.
You think he'll help
get your son back?
Wake up.
Look at you.
You think you can raise a kid?
Want some money for a cab?
I know we're not Limp Bizkit,
but for once
I'd like to do a sound-check.
The band before you screwed up.
I can't be everywhere.
Don't take it so personally.
It's the club-owners who suck.
They care about the beer they sell
not the music.
I don't like being yelled at.
I'm upset.
I had to get it off my chest.
This morning I got the demos
I did with Gloria.
Who's Gloria?
I told you about her.
I met her in prison.
- Are You angry?
- You bet your ass I am.
In prison who was the punk
you or her?
No, it's like that for the men.
For us, the problem was trying
not to get raped by the guards.
But... if you care...
I managed just fine, thanks.
Thank God for your letters.
Everyone else forgot about me.
Come off it.
Except the press
who wrote tons of crap.
Yeah, here too.
Skip the first two tracks.
They're mediocre remixes.
Start with the third.
You do the vocals?
I wrote the lyrics too.
Gloria did the music.
Come on, Elena...
That was an easy shot.
Is Gloria still in jail?
She was involved in a hold-up.
A guy got hurt.
She's been in over a year
and hasn't gone to trial yet.
How many tracks do you have?
About ten.
I know it sounds pretty rough,
but obviously
the conditions were lousy.
Not good, not bad.
I can't say.
Like a lot of other stuff.
You mean it sucks.
I didn't say it sucks.
Let's get out of here.
Hello.
I'm lrene Paolini's assistant.
- Hello.
- This way.
She shouldn't be long.
With her you never know.
I'm always apologizing for her.
It's a real pain.
I know. I used to work with her.
- I know.
- Really?
I watched you
every week on the cable.
Introducing video clips, MTV-style
dressed like a total bimbo.
I watched the show for you.
I was a huge fan. I still am.
Thanks.
When was it...
at least six years ago...
- How old were you?
- Fifteen. I was in high school.
I wore my hair and clothes like you.
Thanks.
- You want a coffee?
- Yeah, I do.
My name is Sandrine.
- We spoke last week.
- Oh yeah?
I put your call through to lrene.
I haven't stopped
thinking of you since.
Last night I dreamt of you.
Was it a good dream
or a bad one?
A little of both.
I went to a hotel.
I had to see you.
They wouldn't let me in.
It wasn't even a fancy place.
I told them
'I'm a friend of Emily Wang's.'
They didn't believe me.
I became hysterical.
I was crying.
It got later and later.
Fortunately Lee Hauser was there.
He recognized me and let me in.
But when we got up to your room...
you'd disappeared.
The bed was left unmade.
- And?
- Nothing. I woke up.
Are you in Paris for good?
I don't know.
It depends on a lot of things.
Does it depend on lrene Paolini?
I need to find a real job.
To do something with my life.
Right now, things aren't great.
It's true that I'm counting on her.
Did she offer you
something serious?
No, nothing.
We just spoke for a minute.
How typical.
All she cares about is herself.
The heyday of cable is over.
The network
doesn't give her much freedom.
It's a police state.
I wanted to work with lrene Paolini
because she used to try new things.
I guess that's sort of true.
She's given up now.
You're being harsh.
You had your share of blows.
You've lashed out too.
People badmouth you
but you haven't given up.
That's why I respect you.
And not lrene Paolini.
Are you okay?
Hey it's you.
I couldn't get hold of him.
They came late
and went to do the sound-check.
But I got you a ticket.
- But no backstage pass.
- You said you would.
Yeah, but they're being control freaks.
I could barely get one for myself.
Tricky has to convince Lee's father.
I want to see my son again.
At least once in a while.
It's only human.
I'm not asking much.
I wrote him a letter.
Will you give it to him?
Call me on my cell phone
after the concert.
I'll tell you where we're eating.
Come meet us.
Did you get to see lrene Paolini?
No. She stood me up.
I'm waiting for another appointment
Hello.
He got your letter.
Someone else gave it to him.
Hold on...
Excuse me tricky I have Emily.
She's on the phone.
And she's on the street outside.
What should I tell her?
- Nothing... OK...
- Apparently, it's not a great time.
What I suggest is that...
Meet us at the stage door.
It's on Rue Caumartin.
Go ahead.
Mr. Li wants to see you.
I called to say I'd be late.
Take care of this.
She's your niece.
Follow me.
- No use coming back.
- What did I do?
You know.
You didn't keep your word.
You must respect your family.
If they respect me.
My mother won't speak to me.
I was like a father.
I lent you money.
I gave you a job.
- What a job!
- It's not good enough for you?
Yeah, yeah...
Ashamed working
with other Chinese?
I never said that!
We had an agreement:
no drugs here.
- I respected that.
- Liar!
They could shut down my restaurant.
Give me a light.
I'm gone for good.
And I'll pay you back.
Don't bother. Keep the money.
London, a few days later.
- Would you like a tea or coffee?
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
Oh I'm so sorry.
I thought I was on time.
- No... You're on time
- Come this way.
So, are you staying long
in London?
My wife is sick.
She has to have some tests.
It depends on the results.
- Nothing serious, I hope...
- No, no.
Here's the first drafts for the cover graphics
for the re-releases.
A friend of Lee did them, Morris Ort.
Do you know him?
No.
He's very talented. He's a painter
who's doing extremely
well these days...
He doesn't normally do this sort
of things anymore but
for Lee, he made an exception.
We're thinking of releasing
all three albums
at the same time
in September next year...
As we agreed, nothing is definite
until we get your approval...
I think he'd like that...
and... if it was a friend of his...
A friend of Lee's did them.
- Who?
- Oh god, I can't remember.
A friend from London, I think.
Is that supposed to be Lee?
Yes, it's...
stylized.
But I think it's pretty good.
Doesn't look like him.
No. I think it does.
When? When did he look like that?
Well... When he was young
when he first left and went to London
and we didn't hear from him for a while.
I read the liner notes
they want to put with the CDs.
So did l.
- I didn't think much of them.
- No.
They give a false image of him.
As if there was nothing
but drugs in his life.
And misfortune...
- It's not true at all.
- No...
It's journalists, they have
this romantic idea of self-destruction.
Lee wasn't self-destructive.
Well...
he did everything to excess.
Less than the friends he hung around
with back then...
they're all complete alcoholics.
It's good they're re-releasing his records.
Yes, I'm happy about it.
Despite the stupid liner notes.
I think they would have
made him laugh, too.
Yes.
- I wasn't gone too long?
- No.
So what did you get up to?
Did you watch cartoons?
Yes.
What did you do
when the cartoon was over?
I read.
You read!
- What'd you read?
- I read MD Geist.
I thought you read that already.
No, I meant the new one.
I have to tell you something.
We're gonna have to stay in London
a bit longer than I thought.
Are we going to stay at the hotel?
Yes. Do you remember
how I told you that
the specialists had examined grandma
Rosemary because she had a very sore back?
Yes.
Well they don't know what it is
that causes the pain.
So they have to keep doing these tests.
So she's gonna stay in the hospital
and we're gonna stay together.
Are we gonna live in the hotel?
Yeah.
The two of us gonna stay in the hotel.
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes.
Now, tomorrow you'll come
with me and
we'll go visit Grandma Rosemary
at the hospital.
Okay.
Sorry, the other day
I was with the head of programming.
I know... it's the same old thing.
I detect a note of reproach.
Not at all.
It's just that I know you.
- You're angry about the past.
- No.
I'm still angry with you.
You really didn't treat me that nice.
We don't have to see each other.
I can leave now if you like.
- No, don't.
- If you act up, I won't stay.
Stay.
So Sandrine says
you're moving back to Paris...
I can't go back to London.
Too many memories.
What are you going to do now?
I wanted to discuss it with you.
A drink?
The same thing... a whiskey.
As I was saying
I thought I'd talk to you.
I thought maybe you could help...
Maybe, but times have changed.
Sure, but times seem to be
treating you okay.
Yes, because...
I'm good at my job...
good at corporate politics.
But if I had a little freedom...
No, please... forget about it.
You're busy
but I wanted to thank you
for the show. It was great.
Thank you. That's so nice of you!
- See You soon, I hope.
- See you soon.
Lee didn't leave you anything?
We weren't married.
We had a joint account.
Almost empty.
And your son?
If I want to see him
I need to turn my life around.
Meaning?
I need a job, for example.
- And to stop shooting up.
- That's history.
- I doubt it.
- I said that it's history!
I was on methadone
but I stopped taking it.
Do you know how often
I hear that in my office?
I've known you long enough
and I've heard all your lies.
- I've changed.
- People don't change.
That's your opinion, not mine.
Sandrine said
you were stoned out of your mind.
You can level with me.
I don't care. It's your life.
She's pretty, Sandrine.
- Do you sleep together?
- No.
She dumped me two months ago.
- Do you still love her?
- Two days ago I followed her all night long.
- Did she know?
- Yes. She pretended I didn't exist.
She was with a woman
her new lover.
I've known for a while.
I couldn't care less.
This woman has
a restaurant near Beaubourg.
It's doing okay.
Not too pretty, but very maternal.
Unlike me.
I did something incredibly stupid.
And it's too late to yell at me.
Sandrine stopped by
to have me sign something.
I got her into the bathroom
locked the door and left.
I swear!
It's not funny!
You're not a kid anymore.
You can't do that!
- I know.
- Pathetic.
Is lrene here?
Come here.
Come closer.
Yes, I'd like a taxi.
Thank you.
- What Did You tell her?
- That it's over.
- Are You serious?
- Dead serious.
- You just killed her.
- I doubt it. But I really hope I did.
This way.
Through the courtyard.
It's lrene.
She'll call all night to apologize.
- You want a whiskey? I do.
- Sure.
Then I'll be going.
Is it true you and lrene were lovers?
It's too much. I'll get drunk.
So what?
Before Lee, you were with lrene.
Not with her.
But yes...
We were lovers.
- Did Lee know?
- Sure he did.
Sorry for all the questions.
No need to apologize.
It's no secret.
Emily?
Emily!
Emily!
- I got it.
- It's heavy.
I'll manage.
Yann and Henri are friends of Jeff's.
- Hi.
- Want to see your room?
I thought you'd call last night.
I saw lrene.
- Any luck?
- No, a dead end.
I told you not to count on her.
I crossed that bitch
off my list ages ago.
You can unpack.
You can stick the crates in the closet.
- Like it?
- It's great.
The bathroom's that way.
If Jeff's dog bothers you
just hit him.
Beat it!
Are you two coming?
- We're finishing something. Later.
- Later.
I told Jeff I'd stop by rehearsals.
Here are the keys.
For the house and for the gate.
You can always reach me on my cell.
Make yourself at home, okay?
See you later.
Emily.
What's wrong?
Want a painkiller?
I took one.
I wish Lee were here.
To take me in his arms.
To tell me it'll be okay.
I'm sick of being alone.
I keep screwing up.
Why did he leave me all alone?
- Hi.
- I didn't see you yesterday.
It was my day off.
That's why you were here on Sunday
and I'll be here again next Sunday...
Oh good.
I haven't been to see Mrs. Hauser yet.
Well, they've promised
they'd do a scan today.
What did the doctor say?
I don't know, I have a bad feeling...
- Are you sure the scan is today?
- That's what they told me.
And that's what they said yesterday
and the day before... same thing...
Listen, I don't know
All I can do is repeat what they tell me.
- I wasn't complaining.
- I'm sorry.
It's me I'm feeling tense...
Let me get it.
- How are you doing with Jay?
- Fine, fine.
It's the first time
you've spent any time with him.
Yes. Even with Lee, I didn't take
much interest until he was...
until he was already a little grownup.
Kids intimidate me.
- Why?
- Because they understand everything.
they read your thoughts
they know what you're going to
say even before you say it.
So...
what conclusions has Jay come to?
He thinks that I'm shy,
a bit awkward, pretty boring...
not that smart
But I'm smarter than he thinks.
- Are you?
- Yes...
He takes coins from my pockets
and he doesn't think I notice...
but I do.
Other than that, he wants to
see his grandmother.
Let's wait until tomorrow.
I spoke to Emily.
- Who?
- Your daughter-in-law.
She lives in Paris.
She says she's off the drugs.
She's getting a job...
I think she's having a hard time
I don't know, I feel sorry for her...
- Albrecht.
- Yes.
I don't want to talk about her.
Of course, but she is
Jay's mother...
and one day, we're going to
have to talk...
One day, Not now.
- Ronaldo Demachy.
- Hi.
Sorry about the wait.
I'll be frank. I'm seeing you
because lrene Paolini insisted.
She's someone I respect a lot.
I won't waste your time.
I want things to be perfectly clear.
I think they are.
Right.
We're opening a boutique
in the Printemps department store.
You'll have certain responsibilities,
but it's a step above salesgirl.
I understand that.
It's very hard work,
and to be honest
not very well-paid.
I've thought it over and I want it.
Do you know our line?
Of course.
We target active women with
limited means but who expect quality.
Not exactly your profile.
But the store
attracts a lot of tourists,
Sure. No problem.
many of them Asian, so speaking
several languages is a major asset.
Come meet Madame Gregory.
She runs the show here.
She's busy overseeing
our new lingerie collection.
Obviously
you'll have to fit into our mold.
- Meaning?
- You can't dress like you are now.
Or like you did on your cable show.
It would look bad.
- You saw the show?
- It was my generation.
It was a lot of fun.
It was before cable TV caught on.
It was for the happy few.
The cool set.
There's Madame Gregory.
- Are you home?
- I'm going out soon.
How was it?
Awful.
- It didn't work out?
- Yeah, it'll work out.
I don't exactly have a choice.
I learned that in prison.
- Learned what?
- To adapt.
If I want to see Jay
I have to change my life.
Even if the new life sucks.
It's the life most people live.
- Yeah, but it's grim.
- Being a junkie was better?
I don't know.
I honestly don't.
- You went shopping.
- A little. For Jay.
He can sleep downstairs.
Don't bother. I'll make room
with me. He'll be fine.
It's no bother for a weekend.
Exactly. If I only have two days
I want him near me the whole time.
Don't get carried away.
What do you mean?
What happens when he has to go?
Back to London. Then back
to Vancouver. It's far away.
I'm sorry to be harsh.
You're right.
Maybe it's better if I don't see him.
I don't know.
Why is Albrecht coming?
I wrote him to say I'm doing well
that I found a job.
I guess he doesn't believe me.
He's checking.
Are you up to the test?
I'm trying to change...
But I don't know
if I can take care of a child.
I want a coffee.
I'll meet you inside.
Got any change?
Remember I told you about Gloria?
- The girl you met in prison?
- She's out.
I thought she was in for a while.
It turns out the case was dismissed.
She called last week.
She wants me to join her.
- Where?
- San Francisco.
She found a label.
They like our demos.
Be careful.
Do you have a contract?
She didn't mention one.
Is there any money in it?
They're willing to pay for sessions
with a real producer.
- What's his name?
- David Roback.
- Got a light?
- No.
He has a group called Mazzy Star.
Excuse me, do you have a light?
Sorry for bothering.
Thank you.
They did a few albums.
Good stuff.
I remember Mazzy Star.
But he's only free next week.
To record on Monday
I'd have to leave on Sunday.
I'm not going.
I don't know how to tell Gloria.
She'll be disappointed.
Tell her you'll come later.
It's now or never.
And Jay comes first.
If I go to San Francisco
I'll fuck everything up.
I've done enough of that.
I won't do it again.
Excuse me.
There you are...
Now, did you do what I said?
Did you set your stopwatch?
Oh yes.
Good
How long have we been in the tunnel?
4 minutes 35.
4minutes 35.
You're right.
What are we going to do in Paris?
I've already told you three times
we're going to see your mother.
- Do I have to see her, too?
- Yes.
- Can't you go by yourself?
- No.
Coffee please.
You didn't tell me, I was going to
spend the week-end with her.
She's your mother.
- She killed my dad.
- No, she did not!
Yes, she did.
Grandma Rosemary told me so.
Jay, you know it was an accident.
No, it wasn't.
He died because
he took the drugs she gave him.
Come on.
I have to talk to you.
Your grandmother and I are old
We won't always be here.
What's gonna happen when we're gone?
I haven't finished timing.
Stop.
She's your mom.
She loves you and you
have to get to know her.
I don't love her and
she doesn't love me either.
You're alone.
Jay didn't wanna come.
What do you mean,
you promised me...
No, I didn't promise you anything
I said I'd come to Paris and we'd talk.
No, you said I have him all weekend.
If he doesn't want to
I can't force him.
It's not good for you either.
He doesn't want to see me.
He doesn't know you.
He hates me.
I don't know
He never talks about you.
I know but...
If you'd told me earlier...
I wouldn't have gone my hopes so high.
I'm trying to do my best
It's not easy.
I know. Me too.
We have to stay in London.
Maybe for a few weeks
Give him some time. I'll talk to him...
You can come over and see us.
I'm sorry I can't do this
Let's meet another time.
Albrecht!
- Hello.
- Hello, a table for two.
- Smoking or No smoking?
- Smoking.
Step this way, please.
Thank you.
Jay is here, he's with me in Paris.
He's at the hotel, it's not far from here.
His grandmother
she thinks we're in Scotland
she doesn't know he came with me here.
How is she doing?
They'll do a little operation
next week.
After that, it just depends
on the tests.
She seems to think...
Well, to be honest, I can't even mention
your name in front of her.
Because she thinks that I'm responsible
for what happened to Lee.
Yes.
that and everything else, his decline.
How about you?
I believe in forgiveness
People change.
If they need to, they change.
But I don't want to hurt Rosemary.
If she thought I'd brought Jay
here for one second
it would tear her apart
I called you back because
what you wrote in your letter
really moved me.
But you don't trust me.
Does that make any difference?
I mean, Emily, I'm old
I won't always be able to look after Jay.
You mean... by yourself?
Yeah, that's it... that's exactly it.
Without Rosemary...
So, have you started your new job?
Yeah I sell clothes for active women.
At Printemps, it's a department store
but I get the weekends off.
Printemps
somehow I can't imagine you.
It's better than nothing for now.
You'll find something you'll love
you'll find something else.
- I hope so.
- Oh, you will.
Wait for me
I have to talk to him first.
If he doesn't want to, then...
No. No. No
Of course... Of course.
I am completely in your hands.
If you choose to,
you can run off with him.
You're his mother.
You don't risk much.
I won't.
And you will bring him back by 3:40
train tomorrow afternoon?
Yes.
I'm sorry Emily,
I need you to give me your word.
You have my word.
Okay.
- Have you been on a scooter before?
- No.
Would you like to try?
Come on, you'll see...
It's really fun, come!
- Are you scared?
- No.
Since you didn't say anything
I thought you were scared.
I'm not scared.
- Maybe you're scared of me?
- No.
- Your granddad said you were scared of me...
- No.
I'm glad to hear it
Hold on tight! Let go!
Come on.
When I was a kid
I only liked tigers and monkeys.
- Do you like monkeys?
- Depends which ones.
How about the gorillas?
- I have seen gorillas.
- Where?
In Canada
At the Vancouver zoo.
Oh come here, look!
Is it nice the Vancouver zoo?
- Much better than this one.
- Come on, look at the zebras
This one's lame
What's it called again?
It's the Vincennes zoo.
That's the name of the town.
- We're not in Paris?
- No.
In Vancouver there are grizzly bears
elks and beavers.
Maybe they've got some here.
We can ask.
No. I've seen enough
of them in Canada.
They're everywhere.
Once one tried to bite me.
- One what?
- A beaver.
- Are they dangerous?
- No, they're really dumb.
Look, there's a baby.
So what do you want to see now?
I want to see a snow leopard
with white spots.
A snow leopard,
that's a very rare animal.
I'm gonna ask the guy over there.
- You wait for me here?
- Okay.
Thank you.
Jay...
Jay!
Jay!
Jay!
- Do you think that's funny?
- No.
Me neither.
I don't want to spend the weekend
with you now.
- Why not?
- Because you killed my dad.
- Is that what you think?
- I'm not the only one.
- Who else?
- Everyone.
- I didn't kill your dad.
- You gave him drugs that killed him.
That's not true.
Then why does
everybody say you did?
- Because they don't know.
- You're a liar.
Come on.
Let's just get out of here.
It was me who went and brought
the drugs that night.
He tooks some, I took some...
That's the way it was
always between us...
What's the difference
who bought them...
Anything could have happened...
It could have been Lee losing me...
And you know what?
Drugs are more complicated than
what most people think they are...
Some people need them because
they're suffering because they don't know
how to live any other way...
your dad was like that...
And me too...
Because you're weak.
No, your dad wasn't weak.
He did some really great work
but it wasn't easy for him...
You have to be
very strong to do that...
You should be proud of him.
Then how come he needed drugs?
They gave us some really good times.
But afterwards, you always have to pay
the price and it's very high.
- Look at me I'm still paying.
- You're not on drugs anymore?
- I gave up Mainly for you.
- Why for me?
Because otherwise I know
I'd never seen you again.
Hi Sniff, that's Jay.
Anyone home?
Elena's gone out.
- Here's the box.
- Thank you.
I'll show you upstairs our room...
It's on your left.
So this is the room Elena lends us.
She is really nice.
You gonna meet her later.
You don't have your own room?
It was in London.
Why don't you live in London?
- Too many memories.
- Memories of my dad?
Yes.
You don't want to remember him?
Yes, but not for now
it's still too painful.
- How about later?
- Yeah... Maybe later.
And how about you?
Do you like London?
Yes.
- More than Vancouver?
- Yes.
Albrecht and Rosemary are nice
but they're old and sad.
- Because your father died.
- Because Rosemary is going to die.
- She told you that?
- Yes.
I'm gonna make some hot chocolate.
Do you want some?
Okay.
Look over there
there's some DVDs.
Choose if there's one you
wanna to watch...
Go upthere.
Hey, it's Gloria.
Are you there?
No? I'm in San Francisco, at
the Triton Hotel on Grant Street.
Remember, I told you about it...
Please, please, please, call me back.
David put the sessions off
48 hours to give you
one last chance to get here.
I don't know what else to say.
I'll give you the number...
Just a minute it's...
Can I watch this one?
No way. That's not for kids.
Are you going to San Francisco?
I don't know... I don't think so...
That's where I was born.
Yes.
What's San Francisco like?
It's a beautiful city by the sea.
There's a big bridge
you must have seen it in photos, no?
If you go, can I come too?
Try one of these, they're really good.
Are you sure there's not another film
that you'd want to watch?
There must be something...
Oh look! Robbie le Renne,
have you seen that?
- You hurry up, alright?
- Okay.
- I wait here.
- Okay.
Emily!
You're bringing him back already?
No, he forgot something.
- What?
- His hat.
His hat?
I thought he had it with him.
- So how's it going?
- Very well.
- Has he adopted you yet?
- Well...
I forgot to take my magazine.
And your hat...
- But now you have it.
- Yes.
Pull it down over your ears
otherwise you'll get cold...
I've get to talk to your mom, OK?
Let's go inside...
In you go.
What did he get from upstairs?
His passport.
I thought so.
Where's he going?
He wants to come
to San Francisco with me.
I got offered to record some songs
there and it's a chance
that's never gonna come back.
So you're giving up...
Clothes for active women
at Printemps, yeah.
Good... Glad to hear it...
Thanks...
Come on...
I think it's brave of you...
It's easy to be brave
when things are going well...
But when life is more difficult
it's unusual... And special.
I'm sure that's
what Lee would advise you to do.
I have a deal for you.
- Do I have a choice?
- Of course you have a choice.
He's your son.
You're his mother.
Rosemary is not going to live very long.
I want him to stay with her.
So she can see him now and then...
So, you go to San Francisco
and then come join us
in London afterwards...
Is that okay with you?
Of course...
It's going to be a very difficult time
for me... and for Jay...
He's gonna need his mother...
to protect him...
And I'll try and help
rebuild a life,
...a new life
if that's at all possible...
for both of you...
Okay?
Go.
Chris, stand by.
I think she's ready,
go ahead and roll it.
I saw her
coming to me
You will leave here tonight
everybody
is in ocean
drinking wine from the bar
Going home with the stars
up in the sky
Me
I am down in the light
There's a rhythm
Don't ya know it
Right here, for everything
There's a lady
She's a killer
Silver mountain in her eye
Going home with the stars
up in the sky
Me, I am down in the light
Me, I am down in the light
Emily, maybe we should
take a break for a few minutes.
Emily, I really liked it.
I think we should go on
and do another song.
Alright.
That was so great...
- You're not tired?
- No, I'm fine.
OK, great.
