Joan Elizabeth Stanley?
You're resident at this address?
- Special Branch. You're under arrest.
- What's going on?
You are being charged with 27
breaches of the Official Secrets Act.
You must come with us now.
In other news,
the investigation is continuing
into the death of former head
of the foreign office
Sir William Mitchell.
A statement will be made
to parliament on Friday.
Sit here, please.
I don't want a lawyer.
I haven't done anything wrong.
- Mrs. Stanley, you're being charged with treason.
- What?
Unless you can prove
to the contrary
your name will be released
to the House of Commons
on Friday.
Why?
There's a case against
Sir William Mitchell
which strongly implicates you.
If you're going to present
a defense
then you must do it
before Friday.
I've nothing to defend.
There's a file on you
starting in 1938
when you went to
Cambridge University.
Mrs. Stanley?
My room's on the third floor.
Can't climb that high.
I have been out on the razzle.
Are you also a first year?
- English literature?
- Uh, natural sciences. Physics.
I was fooled
by your cushion covers.
Modern languages.
Can I borrow a dressing gown?
If a bulldog catches me, I can
say we were drinking cocoa.
Is that a mink?
Hideous, isn't it?
My mother's cousin bought it by.
No, it's not hideous.
It's different.
I'll bring it back tomorrow.
Thank you so much.
Oh, just a second.
Hey! Hello.
That's the girl
I was telling you about.
It's all been
a bit of a scramble.
My mother was so busy
ordering me my college trousseau
that we didn't buy any of
the practical science equipment
let alone the set texts.
So, were your parents
against you coming here?
My father was delighted.
Yours?
I'm an orphan.
Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry.
No, it happened a long time ago.
Flu. Russia.
So, I went to live with
my cousin, Leo, in Germany.
He had just moved there.
Then when Leo came here,
I followed him.
He's a student here, too?
St. John's.
You know, I guess
I'm just making up excuses
why we're older
than everybody else.
Russia. Germany. That's where
modern language is.
After the first three
it all gets really easy.
We're Jewish, by the way.
Oh, I've never met a...
Mazel tov.
Pardon?
Would you like to come to
a film night with me tomorrow?
Mm... Oh, I'd love to
but I have my tutor
Sherry evening.
Let's go.
That's William.
William Mitchell.
He's a... He's a viscount
or something.
Kharak is a maharaja.
Are we the only ones here
without a title?
William, Kharak.
Wonderful to see you.
That's my cousin. Leo.
Fancy for film night.
Socialists can't have glamour?
You must be Joan. I'm, uh, Leo.
Oh.
Sonya says you saved her life.
Oh.
Eh, not exactly.
Hope you enjoy the film
then... Joan.

Mrs. Stanley?
At Cambridge you were known
to consort with communists
and attend their meetings
and their film showings.
Oh, is that
what all this is about?
Well, everybody did it
back then.
Even if the films were dreadful,
not like you could say it.
It was the in thing.
The world was so different then.
You've no idea.
So, tell me, Mrs. Stanley
would you describe your father
as a socialist?
Goodness.
Well, he was the headmaster.
He cared for the ordinary man.
Well, he'd seen the Jarrow
Marchers pass through the town.
But a socialist? No.
So, who politicized you, then?
It's a peculiar way
of putting it.
My family escaped anti-Semitism
in Russia to settle in Germany.
Not the best decision.
By the time I was at university,
Hitler's thugs were
unstoppable.
But I would not hide from them.
Not because I was a hero
but because if I did not
stand up to them, who would?
Well said, sir!
My small action could join
with a small action of another
until we had a movement.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Compelling, isn't it?
All of us have to decide
which side we are on.
Warmonger!
The war has already begun.
While they are saying
peace at all costs
we are being dragged into
the future by dark forces.
- We have to stand together.
- Yeah!
Finish our enemies
of apathy and hatred.
Rally our allies of hope!
- Yes!
- Courage! Honor!
- Yes!
- Take action.
- Yeah!
- Join us!
- Great speech, Leo.
- Well done, young man.
They tried to drown him
you know?
The Nazis?
They beat him up and threw him
off a bridge.
What did you think?
- Very moving.
- Moving?
- I wanted it to be rousing.
- Extremely good show, Leo.
- Thank you.
- Yes, well done, old chap.
If I hadn't already,
I'd sign up on the spot.
"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times.
"It was the age of wisdom.
It was the age of foolishness.
"It was the epoch of belief.
"It was the epoch of
incredulity.
"It was the season of light.
It was the season of darkness."
"Tale Of Two Cities."
Book one, "Recalled To Life."
That's communism.
That's Dickens.
I'd have thought far too English
for you.
So, uh, what... what made you
want to read physics?
The clever answer
is that when in 1932
they discovered the neutron
and the whole world changed
and I wanted to be
a part of that.
But the reality is tadpoles.
When my sister and I
were little, we used to go down
to our local pond
and take them home with us.
They were a bit smelly, so we
gave them a nice hot bath.
And accidentally
burnt them alive.
- You are a monster!
- No!
It made me want to understand.
Now I'm here studying physics.
I want to show you something.
Let's go.
This way.
Tell me, if all of this... whole
world is going to be destroyed.
What would you save?
The pyramids,
the Eiffel Tower, perhaps.
Oh, why those things?
Why any of them?
Maybe it's a chance to rebuild
a civilization from scratch.
A completely new way.
My little comrade.
See you at the meeting.
Mrs. Stanley?
"I, Zinoviev,
would like to repeat
"that I am fully
and utterly guilty.
"I'm guilty of having been
the organizer
second only to Trotsky, of the
attempted killing of Stalin."
Do you think Stalin forced him
to confess?
Of course not. His confessions
are freely given.
The only people
who claim otherwise
are members of
the Western press
out to discredit the USSR.
But surely you can see
why they say
some of the confessions
aren't credible.
- Who's they?
- Most people in England.
Then they are playing
into the hands of criminals
and enemies of the state
who plant confusion.
The final words of his
co-conspirator Kamenev say it all.
"Whatever my sentence may be,
I consider it just.
Together with the people,
follow where Stalin leads."
How funny about you and Leo.
What about us?
Are you sleeping together?
Sonya!
What are you waiting for?
We're in love, but...
I think people should be
in love.
See?
You silly goose.
Love? That's not how Leo works.
If you wait for him to say he
loves you, you'll die a virgin.
Anyway, it doesn't matter now,
does it?
What do you mean?
He's going next week.
Where?
Russia! For three months!
Oh, we can write.
Well, I think
it's a wonderful opportunity.
I'm... I'm giving a lecture
and th... and then I'll be
taking a tour of the factories
for my thesis.
Oh, Leo. I'll miss you.
My little comrade.
- Hello.
- Oh.
Mom?
Mom!
Ah! There you are. Listen,
I heard the strangest thing.
I've been calling you.
Is your sciatica back?
I got a call in chambers.
It's a tip-off from the CPS,
who'd somehow heard this from MI5.
It's utterly ridiculous.
You'll laugh.
I don't suppose you've heard
about a man
called Sir William Mitchell
who died recently?
Mm-hm.
Well, they think
that he was a communist
and might have been part of
some Cambridge spy ring.
But that's not the funny part,
this is.
They think that
you might be involved.
It's nonsense, isn't it?
Isn't it?
What's the matter?
What have they done to you?
It's like a nightmare.
Can't believe
it's happening, Nick.
They've put me under
a control order.
What?
Sir William, I knew him
at Cambridge.
We were there at the same time.
This is an absolute disgrace.
I'll talk to Bernard directly.
I'll take them to the bloody cleaners.
How dare they put
that thing on you!
The Home Office has announced
that all foreign nationals
must report immediately
with their passports
to their local police station
for registration. Initially...
- Darling!
- Hello!
So sorry I'm late.
You know what Allister
can be like.
Allister?
I thought it was Angus.
Kinda was Angus.
This is Allister.
Afternoon.
What would you like, ma'am?
Uh, tea and crumb bread please.
Coffee, please.
Have you heard from Leo?
I've not heard a word for weeks.
They will let him back in,
won't they?
Don't worry about Leo.
Our passports
make it difficult for us.
But he can be very persuasive.
This is war, Sonya.
And his beloved
Stalin's in coots
with the Nazis
who tried to kill him.
You mean the pact?
That's just tactics
to buy his time.
Not us. You.
We're not on the
same side anymore.
Jojo!
Oh, Leo!
I missed you so much.
Did you miss me?
Yes, uh, not as much as
the roast beef at the Eagle.
- You rotter!
- What?
How did you get back in?
Well, I... I told them
I had to finish my studies.
But I, I might be
on borrowed time.
Communist International.
Comintern.
That was the name of the group.
- I was never a member.
- Of the group?
- Of anything.
- Why not?
I didn't agree
with what they said.
When are you gonna realize
you're wasting your time?
Because we're not.
Are we, Mrs. Stanley?
Mr. Leo Galich. You've been termed as an
enemy alien under the Emergency Powers Act.
- Come now.
- He's on our side.
- Can I take anything?
- One case.
Don't you know anything?
The Nazi's tried to kill him!
I have been expecting this.
Do not...
Young lady, he's a German.
- You...
- Joan! Joan! Joan!
Oh, can we have a moment?
We'll be outside.
You, you should be ashamed
of yourselves!
Joan.
Come here.
Please, do not take this
so hard.
I can't bear it.
Hey... this is not the Joan
I know.
When this is all over, we'll...
...we will be together.
In 1940,
Sonya went to Switzerland
and Leo was interned briefly
on the Isle of Man.
I lost touch with him then.
No, you corresponded regularly.
Right up until you started work
at the Tube Alloys Project
in Cambridge in '41.
So, did Leo Galich
get you that job?
Bag please, miss.
Joan Smith. Very punctual.
I'm Max.
Alright. Follow me.
You come highly recommended.
First Class Certificate
in the Natural Sciences.
Specializing in
theoretical physics, professor.
Oh, we're gonna be working with
the Yanks here, so just Max.
Do you have any idea
what we do here?
No, I just had a letter telling me
to report here for an interview.
Hm. Yes.
We recruit by personal
recommendation only.
This way.
So, I'm looking for a personal
assistant.
Typing, filing, you know,
that sort of thing.
But crucially, someone
who understands the science.
Now that's important 'cause you
could be a party
to everything that goes on here.
So before we go any further
I'm going to need you
to sign one of these.
It's, uh, an undertaking that
binds you to absolute secrecy.
Do you have a pen?
So, our name, Tube Alloys.
Any idea what that means?
I would assume you're developing
non-corrosive metals
for oil drills or gas pipes.
But I don't know how it fits
in with secret war work.
Tube Alloys is a code name.
Even some members of the cabinet
don't know what we do.
Am I allowed to know
what you do?
Our aim is to break the machine.
- Touch the ghost of matter.
- And that means?
After your probation.
It can't be right.
235 with the radius is...
Mmm...
I'm sure we'll get
a better answer
as soon as we have
the data on 235.
But getting enough of
the damn stuff is tough.
Centrifuge?
I'm so sorry,
I... I studied gases.
- Say that again.
- I studied gases.
No, the, the other bit.
Oh, well, I'm sure you've
already thought of this but...
...a centrifugal force
could separate
a gaseous mixture
of the two isotopes.
That's good.
Well, it's an interesting
theory.
Uh, go and have a chat
with Spencer about it.
Um...
This is exactly why I wanted a first
class science graduate as an assistant.
Not a pretty face.
I mean, of course you're not
not a pretty face.
- Can we start again?
- Please do.
Um... imagine if it were possible
to separate the two isotopes
and you had a critical mass,
pure uranium 235 in isolation
and one atom split.
That would produce
more neutrons.
And then... more uranium nuclei
would split.
The result would be a
self-sustaining chain reaction.
- A bomb?
- A super bomb.
If we have a chance in hell of
winning this damned war
we have to beat the Germans
to it.
Now, I want you... to read
these summaries
see if you can create
a... a basic diagram
for the layman to understand.
Now we... we don't have
much time.
We have an important delegation
arriving.
Not just scientists,
Deputy Prime Minister Attlee
as well as Sir James Chadwick.
- James Chadwick?
- That's right.
Noble Prize winner for discovery
of the neutron?
Hope you're good at drawing.
Joan!
William! Hello!
You're a long way
from the foreign office.
Came to see my old tutor
before he pops his clocks.
- You heard from anyone?
- Well, Leo writes.
Sonya has my new address
but no word.
The cat that walks alone.
Enjoying your job?
Working in science is all
I ever wanted to do.
- Which is, exactly?
- Research.
- Into...
- You know I can't say.
Come on, Jojo.
Now, we've reconnected,
I could pop up next week
maybe you could show me around
your office.
- Laboratory.
- And we could have lunch.
- I... I can't.
- Come on.
They're going
to send me abroad any moment.
- We might not have much time.
- William, I...
I just have to say that...
Well, I don't think
of you that way.
What way?
- Husband material.
- Oh, God.
Joan, I'm already spoken for.
Remember Kharak?
We've been together for years.
So, William knew what
you were doing
at Tube Alloys, didn't he?
- Did you tell him?
- No, I didn't tell him.
I didn't tell anyone.
Who's there, Ms. Smith?
It... it's just my cousin,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick.
He's here to, um...
Make passionate love to her.
...help me build a bookshelf.
Well, you can't
even tell me the basics.
No, I can't. It's the rules.
We're on the same side now.
- Even Churchill says so.
- I'm not telling you.
I've left the party.
- Did they make you?
- No.
It's easier for Comintern.
I can continue my work
in Canada
and not be considered
as security risk.
You're going to Canada.
I need your help, Jojo.
That's why I'm here.
I thought you're here
to see me.
Well, come on.
That goes without saying.
Well, try saying it sometimes.
My little comrade.
When the USSR came into the war
Churchill had promised that
all technological advancement
will be shared.
He's not kept that promise.
We need documents, designs.
Research.
How do you know...
...about the project?
It's nothing to do
with you and me.
It's about saving
the revolution.
You want me to smuggle
the research out?
- To steal it?
- No, I want you to share it.
No, Leo. No, I won't.
This new weapon, it, it is
on a completely different level.
Is it not?
- Help us.
- Absolutely not.
You know, Jojo, I really
expected more from you.
Do... do you not... do you
not see it my way?
In a special position
you can change the world.
Oh, for God's sake,
another one of your rallies.
- Jojo, listen!
- No, Leo!
I won't! I won't do it!
You shouldn't have asked me.
Just leave. I've had enough!
You are being principled an...
an... and stubborn
for no reason.
Just go!
I have to take this.
The time's now is 12:31 and this
interview is suspended.
You never told me
you worked on the bomb.
I couldn't tell you.
I'd signed
the Official Secrets Act.
I'm not angry, mum, I'm...
I'm... I'm just surprised.
I mean...
I thought you were over-educated
for a librarian.
It's like I don't know you.
I'm your mother.
Did you know what
the bomb could do?
Well, we knew that we had to get
it before Germany.
Just imagine
if they got it first.
We knew we were doing
something worthwhile.
You know, for the long term.
- The uses of its energy.
- Did dad know?
Yes, that's why
we moved to Australia.
I thought you met
on the boat going over.
Well, you...
We, um, we... we did know
each other beforehand, but...
...we thought it would be better
if we pretended...
Is anything you've ever told me
actually true?
Is everything relating to you?
Deputy prime minister,
Professor Chadwick
this is Professor Edwards,
Professor Jenkins.
- Good morning.
- Professor Thurow.
- Good morning.
- Professor Holloway.
- And this is Donald Hastings.
- Good morning.
He's in charge of quantitative
and qualitative analysis.
And are you in charge of
the tea?
Come a long way.
Not far enough, sir.
We need to build a reactor
to breed plutonium.
- The Canadians.
- Exactly.
- If we could share with them...
- We'll need to go there.
With your permission, sir.
Agreed.
If you succeed, you understand
what it means.
A seat at the table.
How will we sleep at night?
At the moment it's, it's only
intended as a deterrent.
All the more reason
to develop one of our own.
Otherwise the Yanks
will control everything.
We need one now
and we need it with
a bloody Union Jack on top.
Sonya!
You're late, so the landlady
let me in.
- So lovely to see you.
- And you.
Three years.
Thanks for looking after
my trunk.
Mm. That's alright.
- Oh!
- I'm married.
To Jamie.
Met him last winter
in Switzerland.
Thanks to William.
He is a pinko...
...and he is English.
Is that why you're back?
- Where will you live?
- Ely.
Ah, ah! Look!
Do you know what happened
to my mink coat?
It disappeared.
I'm going to Canada.
- I hope you're in a convoy.
- In a destroyer.
It's terrifying.
Well, with some
handsome scientists?
Anyone a catch?
They're all married.
- So?
- Sonya!
Ah, come on.
You know, Leo's in Montreal,
at the university.
- You could see him.
- Montreal. I don't think...
Imagine how annoyed Leo would be
to discover
you're having an affair.
Oh, stop it!
It's a hell of a journey.
What else is there to do
except have marvelous sex?
I thought I'd take a book.
- ...becomes explosive
- Well, then...
So, that's why
the backup reactor
is, uh... uh, a breeder reactor.
The thing is there's
also chemicals
and you see, if mixed...
Are you alright?
...uranium 233
from thorium or....
Boring, um, Christ!
Listen to me, I'm sorry,
I haven't stopped talking shop
since we left.
There's plenty of time
to go through all of this.
Wouldn't your wife miss you
for five weeks?
I'd be surprised if she even
noticed that I'd gone.
To not being torpedoed.
Yes, receiving.
We married too soon.
- But you were in love.
- Yes.
No. I don't know.
I don't think so.
Have you ever loved
anyone enough to...
There was someone.
I loved him
and I think he loved me.
I thought I was going
to marry him but...
...he never asked.
He sounds like an idiot.
- Professor Davis.
- Ah.
- Taylor Scott.
- Good to meet you.
- Please, this way.
- Thank you.
They'll, uh, take you
to your cabins later.
- Cabins?
- Uh, your quarters.
First, you should meet Kierl.
Oh, no, I met him once before.
Uh, in London, I think.
Oh, that makes it even easier.
And there's something
for the little lady.
It's called a tumble dryer.
- For isotopes?
- No, for laundry.
Not that you'll have any time
to do it.
We're all on 18 hour shifts.
Are there any
American scientists here?
No, no. They stopped sharing
research with us
when they started
the Manhattan Project.
They think all us foreigners
are a security risk
and they got in into their heads
that we Canadians
wanna bring the Russians
into it.
Yeah, well, it might not be
such a bad idea.
- Excuse me?
- Well, the Russians saved us.
We couldn't have stood much more
of the blitz.
Thank God Hitler invaded them,
not us.
Don't let anyone else here know
you think that.
They're our allies.
Now, we've cut them out
of research.
It's hardly surprising it's
making them even more paranoid.
The Yanks want
to get there first.
They don't trust anyone now
and they're looking
for any excuses
to see us shut down.
Ah, uh, Professor Kierl,
this is Professor Davis
and, uh, his assistant, um...
Joan Smith.
- We've met once before.
- Yes. Yes.
I admire
your work at Cambridge.
One, we won't know
if we have enough plutonium
until we have our, uh,
pilot reactor
at criticality
using heavy water.
I'll leave you to it. We all eat
dinner together every night
so I'll see you then.
Two, we are planning
to closely follow
uh, DuPont, Oak Ridge, using
chemical separation techniques.
Uh, bismuth-phosphate process.
Now, about that tumble dryer,
it really is fun. I'm sure...
If I'm gonna get up to speed,
I'll need the help
of first class Cambridge science
graduate with one
of the quickest minds
in atomic physics.
So maybe your,
um, tumble dryer could wait.
Peter Kierl is a genius,
but he's utterly exhausting.
I don't know why the man
can't just talk normally.
Thank you for sticking up
for me today.
You know it's the truth.
It's nice... working together.
Joan...
Don't... don't worry,
I... I promise I won't tell...
No, that isn't it.
I love you.
Don't... don't be silly.
I've loved you from
the moment...
...from the moment I said, "You
are not not a pretty face."
But my wife...
...she'll never divorce me.
And that's why
I don't want to have
just an affair with you,
not like this. Do you see?
I love you.
You deserve more than that.
Maybe, one day...
Thanks.
Uh, one last thing, my, uh,
colleagues would like
to show you around
the University of Montreal.
The university?
Well, no!
Well, I... I mean,
we don't have time.
I have asked them to put
together a tour for you.
Uh, there's been, um, tension
between the university
and us. Uh, you know, funding.
You... you must, please,
meet the dean.
Well, yes, thank you. Goodbye.
- Hello. Good to meet you.
- Very good to meet you.
- Max Davis.
- Please, this way.
- Professor Smith.
- Max Davis.
Mr. Jones.
I'm Professor Jones.
Jojo.
What are you doing in here?
Well, I was told by our friends
that you were visiting
the university.
I meant lurking in the ladies.
Well, uh,
we can't be seen together.
Oh!
You are on a research trip.
Mm-hm.
- Dare I ask?
- No.
Jojo, I... I had to find you.
Oh, hell, I can't stop
thinking about you.
My little comrade.
The bomb must be shared.
The Russians,
they deserve to know.
Or the, uh, the Allies
are going
to do something
dreadful with it.
Do not be naive.
Joan.
I... I'm sick
of your poison kisses.
Has any of it...
us been real?
Joan?
I'm fed up of being picked up
and let down.
You pop back whenever
you want something
and never when I need you.
Is everything alright?
They're waiting
to start the tour.
Coming.
You've got me all wrong.
If you change your mind...
...call Sonya.
Did you meet Leo in Montreal?
And what about after the war,
back in Cambridge?
Mrs. Stanley.
One hundred and eight long tons
releasing the equivalent
of 22 kilo tons of TNT.
Successful detonation
in New Mexico!
Oh, one chance to get it right
and they did it!
Congratulations!
- Now, what?
- They'll use it.
Japan.
Well, they... they will
warn them first. Won't they?
Well, I went to the pictures
last night
and saw the newsreels
of the death camps.
We should've used it
on the Krauts.
No, but... but unlike
the Germans
the Japanese,
they'll never surrender.
It would mean the death of
hundreds of thousands of people.
Don't think like that.
We're scientists
and our... our job is to get
the physics right.
Leave the politics
to the politicians.
Now, listen, it's not a secret
that America has the bomb.
It's bound to come out
that we're trying to make one.
Stalin will want one, too.
Ah, well, what are they gonna do
about that?
They'll bring Russia in on it.
They will.
- Won't they?
- I don't think so.
- But we're allies.
- For now, but who knows later?
Yeah, but when we were
in Canada, you said...
They won't want Stalin having
a weapon like this.
Why? In case he uses it
like we could?
Uh, look, I... I tell you what
scratch your list.
Uh, pub lunch on me
and the afternoon off.
What do you say?
The first atomic bomb
has been dropped
by United State aircraft
on the Japanese city
of Hiroshima.
President Truman has said
that the device
was more than 2000 times
more powerful
than the largest ever bomb
used to date.
President Truman has announced
a second bomb
has been dropped
on the city of Nagasaki.
Seventy-four thousand people
have been killed...
This is what Hiroshima
looks like after the blast.
Four and a half square miles
of this heavily populated city
completely burned out.
One hundred and thirty-five
thousand dead
either killed instantly
or from the effects
of radiation in the aftermath.
Nobody yet knows how many more
thousands will die
in the coming years
due to radiation.
The world has never witnessed
destruction
on this scale before.
- Gili 436...
- Sonya!
- Joan.
- I've got something for you.
Preparing exhibit E.
Can we wrap this up,
we've been through all this
she's denied everything
you've alleged.
Passing exhibit E
to the accused.
Do you recognize this?
No.
This report was produced
by the Cambridge division
of Tube Alloys in 1945
just after
the end of the war.
It's classified material.
Yet somehow it found its way
into a KGB file in Moscow
attributed to Agent Lotto.
Who's Agent Lotto?
We have this file from a
recently defected Russian agent.
Well, what's it got to do
with me?
Joan!
Oh!
I've become so English.
I'm desperate for a tea.
- Sonya.
- What?
- Congratulations.
- Oh, this.
I thought it was about time.
It's been so much easier than...
Than what?
Than I expected.
Jamie's been wonderful.
So, have you got something
for me?
What if it goes wrong?
The KGB will have me shot.
I mean here.
The British hang you
for treason, don't they?
Stop scaring yourself.
You're going to be fine.
I'm not brave like you.
Nobody would suspect us.
We're women.
I almost forgot.
- Happy birthday, darling.
- But it' not...
I know it's a little early
so do not open it here.
Save it.
What happens...
...after I give it to you.
I tell Leo.
and some of it, I can radio.
Can't people listen in?
I'll encrypt it first.
Behave normally.
Don't look nervous.
- Thank you.
- Thanks.
We need files, reports
drawings, diagrams...
I'm so sorry.
You should always meet
in public places.
It's too dangerous
to come to my house.
A new material,
make an extra copy.
Don't conceal it.
Keep it with the real filing
until you are ready
to bring it to me.
If you must hide anything
do it in plain sight.
Be prepared to improvise...
- Oh!
- Sorry!
And if you think
you're bring followed
go into a ladies shop.
No man will follow you there.
Hello, Katya.
Agent Lotto.
You did this. Didn't you?
What did you think?
- Nick...
- How could you?
Why?
Everyone in my office, now.
I have been informed by MI5
that Peter Kierl, the scientist
who Joan and I worked with
in Canada
has been uncovered
as a Russian spy.
Now, he's given
the Russians a windfall
which could accelerate them
making their own bomb.
So, everyone, please,
extra precaution
extra vigilance.
Thank you.
Joan, could, um,
can I have a word, please?
What's going on?
Well, it seems Kierl wasn't such
a wet fish after all.
Um, I've been given a list
of potential suspects
identified in Canada
that might've been
Kierl's contact.
One of them is, uh, Leo Galich.
Now, I know that from your file
you were associated with him
while he was here...
He's not the one, is he?
On the, on the boat
when you said
that there was one who...
He didn't...
It was a long time ago.
I still think he's an idiot,
by the way.
I haven't mentioned him
in my report.
There's no need to, is there?
The police are here.
It's some sort of inspection.
Goodness, what a palaver!
Karen, um, I don't suppose
you've got any
spare sanitary towels?
I've been caught out.
I left a box in the cupboard
in the lavvy.
Thanks.
Excuse me, miss. The professor
said you might be here.
We need to examine some files.
- Tea?
- Pardon?
Well, you must be parched.
Not on duty.
Well, you don't need me.
Mind if I take a look?
Of course not.
I... I'm sorry, miss.
Don't worry.
Excuse me.
Don't be scared.
It's only me.
I don't know
how you can be so relaxed.
The police searched
Tube Alloys today.
He was one of yours, wasn't he?
He fell more easily than you.
He was angry
at how the Soviet Union
had been excluded from research.
They're onto you.
MI5, they have your name
on a list.
Well, I'm part
of the establishment now.
I'd look pretty slack
if they hadn't spotted me.
I've... I've been given,
given a research post
at King's College in London
on Soviet Planning Policy.
That's why you're back then?
No.
For you.
I want you to be careful.
I am careful...
Jojo, be more...
...more careful.
You have no idea
how important you are.
There's a key in there,
my London address
telephone number.
Call me... any time.
You better go,
it's getting late.
I rather thought
I could, um, stay.
I'll get some blankets.
The sofa's a bit lumpy,
but there's some cushions.
I have something for you.
It's the patron saint
of scientists.
Are you...
...religious?
We all have one.
Mine is St. Christopher.
Patron saint of travelers.
Curare.
You place it
in the crack of your elbow.
It's untraceable.
Keep it with you at all times.
Will I need it?
So, your affair with Leo Galich
started again?
You saw quite a lot of him
over the next few months?
I'm sorry I have got
a terrible headache.
The time's 15:23,
interview suspended.
Very well, we'll take a break.
We'll see what we can find.
I'm so sorry, Nick.
For what you did
or for getting found out?
No, about all this.
Sorry doesn't quite cover it.
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.
Could you, would you
speak for me
when this goes to court?
I'll plead guilty, I'm not
asking you to lie for me.
Good, we'd both end up in jail
if I did.
Your only chance
is mitigating circumstances.
Well, I knew you'd understand.
I don't!
How could you have done this?
Nick.
You became a barrister
because you believed
in what you were doing.
Well, so did I.
So in your arrogance,
you decided you'd save the world
by sending
our classified documents
to a murderous dictator?
We didn't know that then.
Sonya and Leo and I,
we had no idea.
- They were using you.
- No!
So... Nick...
...will you speak for me?
I don't know.
I don't know if I can.
I've been thinking
of going away.
Where?
Not Russia.
I want you to come with me.
Look, I'll never go there.
Think of what they can offer us.
Years and years ago
you told me
if there was total destruction
which we've had
you communists
would build up civilization
from scratch in a new way.
How is Russia doing that?
All I see is repression.
Somebody will help us.
To make a just world.
An equal place.
I'm not doing it for them.
I'm not doing it for everyone.
God, you are so blinkered.
That's... that's...
that's believe.
And what about my beliefs?
The purity of science,
you've ruined that for me.
And us?
Smokescreen.
Fog.
I've been a fool.
That's not what love is.
Get off.
Excuse me.
Come on, Leo. Answer.
Pick up.
Leo?
The police ruled it suicide.
Our files suggest
the KGB were involved.
I should never have
walked out on him.
What else did he have?
Poor Leo.
I think that's enough for now.
We'll give you a few minutes.
Time's 11:32,
interview suspended.
They'll weigh you out.
It was only a blackout.
I've still got all my marbles.
Did you tell Alisson?
- A... and the child...
- Alisson, yes.
Don't know what to say
to the boys.
Maybe I can.
There's one thing
you have to tell me
and I want the absolute truth.
How much did dad know?
Enough.
What are you doing here?
This is bigger
than one person, you know?
Have you already
whitewashed him from history?
Well, that's what you lot
usually do, isn't it?
Doesn't anyone care why?
Of course, we do.
You know what I felt for him.
Sonya thinks
he'd lost his way.
He was questioning
Stalin and the whole system.
That's rubbish.
He wanted to go to Russia.
I think...
The last thing
I said to him was...
...was that I didn't love him.
And then I found his body.
Look, everyone thinks
you did all this for Leo.
But I know that wasn't true.
I can't start again.
We're not allies anymore.
The war's over.
Yes, with 80 million dead.
20 million of them Russians.
Do you want that again?
- What happens if I get caught?
- You won't.
But, if it looks like you might,
I can help.
- I can get you out.
- How?
I'm pretty high up in
the Foreign Office these days.
For some reason
they rather like me.
Did Sonya tell you
I'm getting married?
She's my secretary. Lovely girl.
It's a good cover
for Kharak.
Listen, Joan...
...we need you.
Let me tell Sonya
to expect your call.
Please connect me
to E-4-3-6.
I'm sorry, caller.
That line
is no longer in service.
Would you like to try another?
No.
No, thank you.
Now boarding!
Now boarding!
Excuse me.
Do you know where this is?
- Thank you.
- Madam.
Sonya?
Sonya?
Sonya?
Are you here?
Oh, Joan.
Come and have a drink with me.
- I have to go.
- Joan.
I thought you said
you didn't want an affair.
I don't.
Then, then why...
I've asked my wife
for a divorce.
I've... I've been asking her
for years, you know
ever since
we... we got back from Canada.
But she's always refused.
You know,
it's the social embarrassment.
But she can't hold out forever.
I've offered her,
well, everything.
I need to be responsible
for my own happiness...
...and that means
being with you.
I still love you, Joan.
Tell me you feel the same.
Yes, sir.
We're from Special Branch.
We're here to see
Professor Davis.
One moment, please.
Max, the police are here.
I mean, how my... thieves
come from us?
The Russians, they've done it,
they've tested.
I mean, how the hell could they?
I mean, they were
nowhere near us.
So, someone must've...
Everything I've worked
for, it's gone!
It's, it's...
I can't believe
this is happening.
Professor Max Davis.
Special Branch.
You're under arrest.
I haven't done anything.
We've received a report
from the Canada Research Unit
about your Russian sympathies.
How could you
let them arrest him?
I thought he was safe.
There was no evidence
against him.
I knew something was wrong.
I had no idea
it was all built on lies.
Oh, what lies? My love for you?
For your father?
You clearly had no love
for your country!
Oh, oh! How dare you?
You've no idea what it was like.
War after war after war!
All the dead, the grieving.
The heartbreak.
We were saturated with it.
I would have done anything
to stop that happening again.
It wasn't about
communism or fascism.
They were using you
and you still don't see it.
Who was using who?
Alright, I was a shadow
in a man's world, invisible.
B... but in the end, powerful.
Betraying your own country,
God, I'm ashamed of you.
I loved my country!
Alright, I was frightened
out of my wits most of the time
but I knew I had to do it.
I knew I had to carry on.
Why can't you understand?
Use your heart for once, Nick,
instead of your head.
- You're a traitor!
- To what?
To millions more dying?
I was fighting for the living.
I thought if both sides
had the same weapon
that could destroy each other,
then neither side would use it.
And I was in a unique position.
I could defuse their bomb,
so I did.
And I was right, wasn't I?
They haven't used it,
not for 50 years.
Have they?
Have they?
Alright, you can call me
a traitor to my country
but at least I was trying
to save the world
from mass destruction.
You're just twisting words.
You gave Russia the bomb.
I'm finished
when this comes out.
I can't.
Can't what, Nick?
I can't do this.
You mean...
You mean,
you won't stand by me...
...your own mother?
Well, I can't do this, Nick.
Not on my own.
You came?
Of course, I came.
Keep your distance, Ho-ho.
The service around here
is terrible.
I, uh, I brought you
some cigarettes.
I've got some news.
I had a letter from my wife.
If I'd known all I had to do
was get myself arrested...
Why are you crying?
I can't marry you, Max.
- Of course, you can.
- No, I can't.
I'll get out of here.
I haven't done anything.
I know you haven't.
Two minutes alone.
Hey. Hey. Come here.
It was me.
What?
The secrets.
Secrets?
I'm so sorry.
I'm going
to tell them everything.
The bomb.
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.
You?
How could you?
Why?
Hiroshima.
Oh, my God.
Why?
I'm going
to tell them everything.
There's a boat to Australia.
I'll get on it, confess,
and then you'll be free.
- No!
- Please.
Just for a few days.
No!
Don't you see
what's the point of that?
I love you.
I... I can't live without you.
I...
I don't want you
to go to Australia.
I love you.
- Do you feel the same?
- Of course, I do.
Max, what have I done?
We go to trial.
There's no evidence.
I'll clear my name.
No, then you'll have to lie
about me in court
and I can't let you do that.
Even if you're acquitted,
everyone will remember this.
You won't be
able to clear your name.
You won't be able to go back
to your old job, your old life.
But don't you see,
I don't want my old life.
I want a new life
here with you.
- There might be another way.
- What?
Time.
What other way?
I will not be put off
any longer.
I have been sat there
for a whole bloody hour.
Now, you tell Mr. Mitchell that
I want to see him right now.
I demand to see him.
It's completely unexpec...
I'm so sorry.
Dreadful misunderstanding.
Did you have to make
such a ghastly scene?
Did you have to ignore my calls?
Everything's falling apart.
Kharak has been posted to the
Indian Embassy in Washington.
It should be a coup,
except he's a terrible lush.
Falling out of clubs.
I think the pressure's
got to him.
That's not why
you're here though, is it?
How could you let Sonya do it?
I can't stop Sonya
doing anything.
Well, you run all the op, right?
My dear girl, Sonya does.
Always has.
I didn't know she denounced him
until it was too late.
Do you think I'd let anyone
hurt him?
Who's this?
- Leo.
- Turn it over.
- Ah!
- Who is it?
Leo's son.
With Sonya?
So that's why she suddenly
went to Switzerland.
Everybody knew except me.
He must think I'm such an idiot.
He felt deeply for you,
you know?
He just didn't have the words.
Listen, I can organize
a full defector program.
Not Russia. Australia.
That's where I want to go.
You're right, Sonya's gone back
to Moscow
and that might be awkward.
Australia...
Alright, but give me
a week or two.
No. There's a boat,
leaves in three days.
And I need two tickets.
You have to get Max
out of prison.
- The professor?
- I told him everything.
Why?
Because I'm not going to let him
rot in jail
for something he didn't do.
No, I can't.
It's too risky.
Uh, you'll have to leave him
and go alone.
You wouldn't.
I have one for your wife
and one for the "Daily Mail."
Two tickets.
Two new identities.
Britain's last spy
from The Atomic Age
has finally been exposed.
Joan Stanley's name
was released
to the House of Commons
yesterday.
She was personally responsible
for providing Russia
with British's atomic secrets.
Joan, have you got
a statement for us?
"I have been accused
of passing information
"to the Russians in the 1940s.
"Information which
accelerated their ability
"to build an atomic bomb.
"I've been accused of deceiving
my colleagues and my family."
This I don't deny.
"But I've also been accused
of deceiving my country."
I'm not a spy.
He moved to Russia...
I don't believe in working
against one's country.
I wanted the Russians
to be on an equal footing
with the West.
I'm not a traitor.
I... wanted everyone
to share the same knowledge
because...
How much
did the Russians pay you?
...because only that way
could the horror
of another World War
be averted.
And I think if you
look back at history
you'll see I was right.
You should be
ashamed of yourself.
- Red Joan!
- Red Joan!
Mrs. Stanley has nothing
to be ashamed of.
She has made real something
which we all talk about
but have no idea
how to achieve.
Peace.
Now, if you have any further
questions for Mrs. Stanley
would you please
address them to me?
I am her lawyer...
...and her son.
