Who is this guy?
Obama
Whose mama?
Obama...Barrack Obama...
What is he saying?
He is saying...yes...
we can do it..
Even we can... do it!!
But you have to admit that...
America has progressed a lot...
even kids speak in English there!
Yeah?
America is heaven...
look at its life, its people,
its ladies..
Too good...too good.
And brother Obama...
is a mixture of Superman and Hanumaan (Monkey
god)...
So why donit you go to your brother Obama in
America...
why wasting time in lndia then? Planning to buy Taj
Mahal?
lt is time of recession..
our Bhaisaab is broke already..
So it is best that you go to America ... to brother
Obama
l will go one day...
Make fun as much as you want..
but mark my words, you will come to see me off at
the airport !!!
Oh! has a dog has barged in..
Oh! You forgot... Bhaisaabis secret code for entry!
Oh! Sallu get up... Bhaisaab is here...getup..
Who called the merchant?
l did, Bhaisaab.
Call him again now.. l want to speak to him
we will have to call from a public phone...
outgoing on mobile is blocked...
... is yours still working?
What did he say?
Hmm...what?
He is willing to pay only Rs.10,000
We had asked 200,000 and he is offering 10,000...
is he paying ransom...or charity?
has the merchant gone crazy?
or he doesnit give a damn for his son..
He said, can't pay the amount due to recession!
Damn!! Recession!!
Bloody recession!!
... Havenit seen recession like this in my entire
career...
Can't even get ransom for kidnapping!!!
demand protection money and they want to borrow
from you!!!
this recession has really spoiled our reputation
lf you donit mind, can l say something Bhaisaab?
We had to lose our reputation...
We only threaten.. but donit do anything..
if you want to expand the business then we must kill
a few people...
this will create fear in them..
You are just chattering for nothing...
Let him speak
He is right...
what were you saying? About business...
Expand...
...meaning progress...
Scientist!
What an educated man... must learn from him...
he is right..
shoot the merchantis son!
we also have a reputation to keep...
who will do it?
l will do it Bhaisaab...l
lf you permit, shall l do it Bhaisaab?
this will get me started as well...
You haven't murdered anyone yet?
Bhaissab...never got a chance..
There was a time...
when even our cooks and gardeners had committed
3-4 murders each...
and now...our own kid is completely dry...
go, you do it!
why risk it with a first timer?
Anni will do it.. You got that!
itis been a while now.. wonder why is Anni taking so
long...
lt was hardly any job...
Donit know about Anni, but why are you screwing
up the fun?
What did l do?
You farted!
Why do you eat so much that you canit digest..
l ate just fine...
lt is just that l am a bit constipated...
there he goes again... how disgusting...
why don't you see a doctor?
l didn't commit a crime guys!
completely ruined our drinking
we're here to do a job... not to smell your farts
..next time we are not bringing him along..
who will decide that?...
you will do what Bhaisaab (Boss) orders...
lts because of your Bhaisaab (Boss)
that we have been sitting here since morning
why did he have to assign this to a novice like
Anni...
sometimes Bhaisaab behaves so immaturely.
Had it been for me we would be home by now...
wonder what Anni must be up to over there...
What happened?
There...
Lets go
its Anni who is crying
Be careful...Watch it!
Watch it!
Oh god! What did you do?
l am hurt badly...
Where the heck is the boy?
He ran away
Hmm... where did he go?
My gun blew up .. My gun blew up...
Oh god..
lts all because of Bhaisaab...
Donit blame it on Bhaisaab
Tie his wrist ..
Stop the bleeding..

Spoke with many people... even requested them..
but everyone says the same thing.. recession!!!
where the heck did this recession come from..
it came from America Bhaisaab!!!
yeah ?
yeah. from America !!!
America???
Why did they have to send their disease to us??
that's what they do Bhaisaab. first they create a
disease
and then put it in a plane and send it to the world...
half the problems of the world are the gifted by
America!!!
is it?
is this what your America is like?
You used to praise a lot about it..

a few days!

kidnap?

he is the one who would take you to America.
tell me one thing, why do you want to go America?
want to make dollars? Right?
And what if the dollars come walking right at your
doorstep
Then why would you want to go to America?
You can keep watching brother obama on the tv.
And keep counting your dollars like this..
This is not right Bhaisaab...Let him go.
Let him go? Are you out of your mind?
l have waited seven years for this man
for how long can we survive with small ransoms?
I hava a dreamto make it big. To be part oftheaaIite.
my whole life is almost gone..
now you want to snatch away my retirement
insurance?
have you gone nuts? Yeah.. Wait..
do you know who is this guy?
Dhananjay Singh!
Dhananjay Singh!! Minister!!
we both started our careers at the same time...
he runs the biggest gang of the state, with respect
& pride.
Donit l have the desires?
to roam around in car with red beacon?
To contest elections.. To break chairs in the
parliament...
will l fulfill my dreams by kidnapping beggars?
50 crore.. Om Shashtri is worth 50 crores at least..
even if we get 5 crore, our lives will be fine
l am thinking about our future, And you want me to
let him go?
but Bhaisab?
No ifs and buts.. Take off your American fantast!!!
And listen you guys..
l donit want any problem in this deal.. do you
understand?
And if someone blows it... then you will see..

how would this ransom money come?
will it be in rupees or in dollars?
l hope it comes in rupees only... what will do with
the dollars...
l think this amount will come direct from the
American embassy!
You think so? Yes.
lsnit it Anni?
Anni, you talk to Mr. Shashtri
get the number and call America so we can move
the matter ahead
yes Bhaisaab, we should start threatening them..
Threats wonit work here..
lt's not that easy...
lts America! Here we threaten and they will send
FBl on our tail..
What FBl ??
FBl is America's Police..
once they come after you.. they donit leave you...
you remember Saddam?
Who? Shakeelis son? You know what he was
saying the other day...
Saddam.. one from lraq!! Hussain!!
he tried to hide in a gutter.. but FBl dragged him out
of that too..
He is absolutely right. FBl is very notorious.
actually Saddam Hussain had a family feud with
that guy...????
what was his name??? The one who was hit by a
shoe??
Bush!
Bush & Saddam had enmity for generations
Bush's father too had issues with Saddam.
father's name was also Bush? Right Anni? yess!
Then Bhaisaab, entire world tried to stop Bush
but he sent the FBl behind him, and one day they
found him...
first Bush got him checked by a doctor, and then got
him hanged.
Who.. bush?
lt was Saddam .. Saddam Hussain..
Take this away..
so how are we going to get the ransom?
Bhaisab.. it is simple. will have to request.
will have to deal with him like qualified people..
we will have to make him believe that...
there is no other way out except paying the
ransom..
only then will we get the money..
it will take some time but it will get done.
What an intelligent kid. lf you had met me before...
l would have atleast become an MLA...
you request, take your time, but remember ...
See he is an American, the news has reached Bush
already!
soon people in underworld too will come to know
then the vultures will soon come to feast on the kill.
So do take time, but do it fast.. you get it?
Take time but do it fast..
Correct.. correct.. Here take some salt..
keep it.. and listen... today give him some veggies
too..
come on take a seat and eat..
Oh what happened Sir? Did you fall from the bed?
what happened ?
what?... Water?
Hope you are not pretending so you can scream..?
l am trusting you. Donit let me down.
remove the strap from my eyes... it is very irritating..

you wont feel good after seeing me!
...the moment l heard your voice.. l knew it was
you..
so this is what you really are! Kidnapper! Criminal!
that day you were begging me so badly..
is this what you will do in America?
its a long story, you wont get it!!!
l don't want to understand anything. lts your choice!
Please let me go. l am in lndia for a very important
work.
nothing can be done now. even if l want.
There is only one way out, pay up the ransom & go
home!!!
how much you want?
Bhaisaab is expecting 5 crore.
but if you bargain well, we can seal it for 3 crore!
you don't know the reality.
l don't have money...where will l get 3 crore from?
where will u get the money from????
call America & transfer the money here & go!!
lf l had this much money why would l come to
lndia...
my family must be worried...please let me go.
Why are you wrecking my brain.. this late at night..
what do you think? You will tell a story & we will
believe you?
do you know Bhaisab has been waiting for you for 7
years.
you are his dream. His future. His bank balance.
His car.
why would he let you go?
Tie me up.

Yeah! Put strap on my eyes

How is that possible, Mr. Shashtri is broke?
That only we know Ali Bhai thinks that he is a rich
man

you
let everything go to hell...do what you want!
