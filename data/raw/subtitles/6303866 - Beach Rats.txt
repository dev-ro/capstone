[MUSIC PLAYING]
Um, hello?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Hey. How's it going?
Are you there?
Hello? [SNAPS FINGERS]
Sound off.
Are you just gonna watch?
Maybe.
Turn on more light. I can't see you.
Come on, let me get a better look.
Pretty. Real pretty.
Thanks.
Do you like what you see?
I don't really know what I like.
Do you want to meet?
No, I don't do that.
- You're wasting my time.
- Wait.
What?
- Let me see it.- It?
Come on, you gonna make me say it?
Say it.
[CHUCKLES]
Let me see your dick.
Sure you don't want to meet?
[ZIPPER UNZIPS]
Hey.
Glad you could be on time for a change.
- You good?
- Yeah.
- What's up, boy?
- I'm good.
P.A.: This is Coney Island, Stillwell Avenue.
Transfer is available
to the D, F, and the N train.
[CHATTERING]
Yeah, that's some fine shit, though.
[WOMEN CHATTERING]
Great seats.
[PEOPLE SCREAMING]
[FIREWORK WHISTLING]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
Aren't they beautiful?
They kind of look the same as they did
last week, and the week before last,
and pretty much the same thing
every fucking summer.
Hater.
You know, this is exact firework show
happens every Friday at 9:30 p.m.
I think they're romantic.
Fireworks are like the opposite of romantic.
So, what's your idea of romance?
[MAN HOOTS]
Let's see.
[MUSIC PLAYING OVER PA]
[SIREN WAILING]
Hey!
[WOMAN SQUEALS]
[GROANS]
Oh, my God!
Whoo!
[BELL DINGING]
[GAME WHOOPS]
Yeah.
- See you later.
- Where are you guys going?
- They're going home, right?
- No, come.
We can chill in the back. I have more weed.
- I don't think she wants us to come.
- He's very busy
for the rest of the night.
We'll take the bud, though.
[HEART MONITOR BEEPING]
Wait, don't look. My place is a mess.
[SNORTING]
[MUMBLES]
Are you too fucked up?
Yeah, kinda.
Besides, I bet you didn't
bring any protection.
Usually the guy has the protection.
What year is this?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Are you fishing for compliments?
No.
Well, I think you're very sexy.
You have these nice, soft lips...
like pillows.
These sad blue eyes.
You kind of stink, but it's turning me on.
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do you think I'm pretty?
You're an asshole.
WOMAN: Get up.
I'm up.
You okay?
- Yeah, I was just out late.
- I know, but are you okay?
Yes.
You have a perfectly nice bedroom upstairs.
It's cooler down here.
Why are you wearing your bathing suit?
I'm going to the beach, asshole.
WOMAN: Knock it off.
Was that a girl I saw creeping out
of my house early this morning?
Maybe.
You could invite her to stay for breakfast.
She had to get home.
- Did you get her car?
- No.
Is that how you treat your girlfriend?
She's not my girlfriend.
Excuse me?
Here you go.
- You good? Working hard?
- Hardly working.
Oh. Sorry.
Let me get one of those.
You want one?
- Oh!
- [LAUGHS]
What the fuck are you guys doing, honestly?
Uh, 2-1.
My bad.
Come on, play.
Yo, ain't that the girl that bopped you off?
Yep.
Maybe he wasn't fucking her right.
MAN: Nah, she pissed I didn't call her.
MAN 2: Yeah, that looks like
her new boyfriend over there.
Where you going?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Please, just a second?
I'm sorry about the other night.
I was fucked up.
I got a lot going on right now,
and I didn't mean to insult you.
Hey, I'm trying to apologize.
Okay.
I got some family stuff going on right now.
[SCOFFS]
My father has this cancer, and, um...
and he's been suffering for a long time.
I've been a little more fucked up than usual.
I wanted to say sorry.
Okay?
Okay.
You, uh, want to come smoke
with my friends and me?
[CHUCKLES]
I think you're pretty. Very pretty.
Intimidatingly pretty.
I have to go to work.
Well... can I walk you?
Yeah?
Let's go.
MAN:
Yo, why don't you invite us over more often?
Shh, yo, keep it down.
Why, you ain't allowed to have friends over?
You guys? You're not my friends.
You got anything better than this?
Nah.
- Come on! Stop playing, boy.
- You got anything?
- [LAUGHS]
- He's lying.
Oh, you thinking about it.
I see you thinking about it.
- Don't hold back on us.
- Come on!
All right, hold up.
Yeah, boy. Come on, go get that, boy.
Shut the fuck up.
Here we go.
30mg Oxycodone? Yo, you got roxys.
This shit's going for, like, $25 a pop
if you get it on the streets.
Yeah.
They're not for sale, though.
- [MUMBLING]
- Yeah. You first.
Yo, how'd it go with that girl?
Booty, big? Small?
She doesn't look like she had a big butt.
[CHUCKLES]
Yo, I wouldn't wife that if I were you.
She just looks... I don't know, man. [LAUGHS]
Will you be seeing her around?
MAN: We have, actually.
I heard she give crazy...
- [LAUGHS]
- [POUNDS TABLE]
Shh, yo, keep it down.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
School is starting soon,
and I'm kind of excited.
I have, um, no classes with my best friend,
but I'll see her during
lunch and gym, so that's okay.
But...
Why don't you go on in?
I will, I will.
I'll go with you if you want.
No, I'm fine.
I promise, I'm fine.
...and new techniques.
Um, I'm excited.
So, that's gonna be fun.
[CHILDREN CHATTERING]
If my dad were here with us today,
he'd want everyone to be happy.
I know that sounds so weird,
but that's what he'd want.
If he were here, he would be cracking
jokes, making fun of the priest,
and trying to make everyone laugh.
He always put everyone else before himself.
That's just the kind of person he was.
If he were here, he'd look
around the room and say,
"What a good-looking family. I'm so lucky."
Do you wanna go up and say something?
No, I didn't really prepare anything.
It's okay, just speak from your heart.
Please rise and sing "Be Not Afraid."
[ORGAN PLAYS]
# We shall cross the barren desert #
# We shall not die of thirst #
# We shall wander far in safety #
# Though we do not know the way #
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry.
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry.
Hello, big boy.
Thank you guys for coming.
What does a porcupine say
when he gets a kiss?
Ouch.
You looking for something?
Yeah, it's just a headache.
Do you want some aspirin?
Got it, thank you.
Hi.
Yo.
I can't really see you.
Better?
- [ZIPPER UNZIPS]
- You look great.
You, uh, you wanna meet up?
When?
How about tomorrow?
Not tomorrow. Tonight.
I don't think I can do tonight.
[CHUCKLES] What's wrong with tonight?
Okay. Where?
You tell me.
[GRUNTING]
[KNOCKING]
So, you like older men, huh?
I don't really know what I like.
[CHUCKLES] Yeah, you seem really unsure.
So, what if I am?
You like this?
[PANTING]
[WATER SLOSHING]
[TELEPHONE RINGING]
Don't answer it.
What are you doing?
Machine's not working.
[RINGING]
Try it again.
[CLICK, BEEP]
MAN: You've reached 941-6352.
We can't come to the phone right now,
but if you leave a message,
we'll call you right back.
- Have a wonderful day.
- [BEEP]
You should take a walk or something.
I will. Where were you last night?
- I was out.
- I know you were out.
I heard you come home at 5:00 in the morning.
- With who?
- [TELEPHONE RINGS]
You're gonna meet her.
That'd be nice.
[CLICK, BEEP]
MAN: You've reached 941-6352.
MAN: Yo, you work here?
Obviously you know I work here unless
you shop at women's clothing stores.
I'm kidding.
I just wanted to say thank you.
- For what?
- For coming.
- It was nothing.
- It wasn't nothing.
- How's your family?
- Coping.
Listen, can I take you out to say thank you?
- You don't have to do that.
- Come on.
- When?
- This weekend.
Give me.
MAN: Don't matter how you cut your hair.
- You're not getting no pussy.
- [LAUGHS]
You guys watching this?
Who's been getting more pussy this summer?
- Me.
- MAN 2: He's kept...
- He's crushing it, Frankie.
- Yeah.
You guys been playing handball?
Yeah. Oh, man, they suck.
I just abuse them every time.
MAN 3: We suck?
- Shit.
- Yo, you about to look like a handball.
- What's the occasion?
- I got a date.
Oh, yeah? What's her deal?
You know, at first I thought
she was pretty basic.
Maybe I was wrong. I don't know.
WOMAN: Oh, you got a haircut.
Oh, you don't like it?
Good thing it's not permanent.
- Come on.
- Where we headed?
Oh, a couple blocks from here.
Oh, I thought we were going into the city.
Why would we go all the way into the city
when there are plenty
of good places around here?
- Okay.
- Come on.
Hey.
- I let you win.
- [LAUGHS] Shut up.
That's true. I didn't want to be rude.
- Oh, really?
- Wipe the floor with you.
Can I ask you something?
Sure.
Do you think that girl over there is hot?
WOMAN: She's fine.
Why, you wanna fuck her?
Me? No. No.
Have you ever made out with a girl before?
Why are you asking?
FRANKIE: Have you?
Sure, lots of times. What's the big deal?
- No, I'm cool with it.
- There's no "it,"
it's just hot when two girls make out.
I'm not arguing.
Okay.
You think it's hot when two guys make out?
No, it's not hot, it's just gay.
What do you mean?
Two girls can make out and it's hot,
but when two guys make out, it's gay.
- You wanna check your email?
- No.
Then why you looking at my computer?
I'm not the kind of girl that's
gonna look through your stuff.
Hold on, I'm gonna pee.
Uh, this is Simone.
Mom, look.
It's nice to meet you.
Uh, can I get you some coffee?
SIMONE: Yeah, thanks.
How old were you when you got that done?
I did it myself when I was 15.
Mom, look at it.
I see. Don't be rude.
- Can I get one?
- No.
But it got infected.
- GIRL: Please?
- FRANKIE: No.
So, uh, where did you two meet?
[CHUCKLES]
On the boardwalk under the fireworks.
Romantic.
I guess you could say there were sparks.
[CHUCKLES]
WOMAN:
Joe and I met there for the first time.
- SIMONE: Really?
- Actually I saw him
on the subway going out there,
but he tracked me down, and he asked me out.
SIMONE: Aw. You take after your old man.
- Bye.
- Bye.
I like this. A lot.
Yeah, me too.
Don't fuck it up.
That would've won a comp, bro.
- MAN: Yo.
- Yo.
- Where you going?
- I got plans.
- He's whipped.
- Maybe. See you later.
Yo, hold up, we're coming with you, man.
- ALEXEI: Yeah, for real.
- Nah, fuck off.
Yo, fuck off.
[BOTH MUMBLING]
[LIGHTER CLICKING]
[KNOCKING]
Hey.
Hey.
You wanna take a walk on the beach?
Are you a cop?
No.
You have to tell me if you're a cop.
It's the law.
That's not the law.
Prove to me you're not a cop.
Get in.
[MAN CHATTERING ON RADIO]
[BLINKER CLICKING]
MAN: You smoke?
Yeah.
[LIGHTER CLICKS]
[CHUCKLES]
Let me see your hand.
Why?
I can tell a lot by looking at your hand.
Like what?
You already know the size of my dick.
You read palms?
[CHUCKLES]
I can tell if you're really gay
by looking at your hand.
I have a girlfriend.
Then let me see your hand.
Are you afraid to find out?
In gay men, the pointer finger
is almost always longer than the ring finger.
And in straight men, the ring finger
is almost always longer
than the pointer finger.
That sounds like some bullshit to me.
Look.
Your pointer finger is longer,
and so is mine.
I'm not buying it.
[CHUCKLES]
[LAUGHS]
[WHISTLING]
Hello?
Mom?
I didn't know you have a little brother.
I don't.
- MAN: Whose room is this?
- Mine.
Uh, I stashed this here for
a rainy day when I was, like, 12.
One stale joint?
Wow. Great.
Let's go.
[GIRL LAUGHS]
[BOTH CHATTERING]
What is he doing here?
I thought you were at the beach.
- I was.
- Tell him to go home.
No. What are they doing in there?
- It's none of your business.
- Are you high?
No. Get that guy out of here.
Fuck off! Stop it.
- Yo, get his clothes.
- BOY: What the fuck?
- Get off of me!
- Let's see how small his dick is, huh?
- Yeah, take his clothes.
- GIRL: Let go of him!
Get off of me!
These belong to you?
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm buying them back, though.
- You wanna pawn it?
- Yeah.
- I'll give you $200.
- $200?
Yeah, $200. Take it or leave it.
All right.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[ALEXEI SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
[BOTH SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
- What do you want?
- Vodka Red Bull.
Excuse me, can we order some drinks?
Hello?
What would you like?
Uh, two vodka Red Bulls.
- On the house.
- Thank you.
Pretty girls drink for free.
No, I got this. How much?
Why argue? It's on the house.
- Because I got it.
- I know, but it's free.
It's on the house.
Did you, uh, make friends with the bartender?
No, it's a mistake.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
# One, two, three, blow #
[CHOKING]
You okay?
Don't follow me.
Let me look at you.
[DOOR SLAMS]
I'm freezing.
Are you on drugs?
Right now? Yeah.
I'm fine.
What drugs are you on?
Good ones. The best.
Do you need help?
No, I feel so fucking good right now.
I just wish I felt this way all the time.
You can't live here and act this way.
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.
Why can't you just let me be?
[FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING]
Hey, I just wanted to check
on that stuff I brought in.
Here, just to let you know
I'm coming back for it.
You got 60 days.
Sixty days?
Fifty-nine left.
Hey.
I can't talk now.
Please, let's just talk. It's important.
- I have a job and stuff.
- Please.
I don't think we should see each other.
Why not?
It's kind of like this.
You're a fixer-upper.
What does that mean?
It means you need a lot of work.
So, you don't wanna see me anymore?
I need newly renovated.
Okay.
- I'm sorry.
- I don't care.
Excuse me, can you refill this?
There is no refills.
What do you mean? There's two left on there.
It does not work.
All right, there has to be a mistake.
There's definitely two refills left on there.
No mistake. I cannot do anything.
You need to check the insurance.
- Okay, thank you.
- Sorry.
Hello.
- Yo.
- How's it going?
Bored as fuck.
Me too.
What are you doing later?
Nothing.
Uh, you smoke?
I have really good weed.
It's from Colorado.
Okay.
Where are you?
Uh, Z and 21st.
- There's an Avenue Z?
- Yeah.
It's like the other side of the galaxy.
Yeah.
But like...
will you make it worth my while?
Yeah.
Cool.
What are you assholes doing?
MAN: Waiting on you.
I have plans, sorry.
I thought that girl dumped you.
Yo, keep her name out of your mouth.
Let me bump a cig.
All right.
Yo, we getting something?
You know I can't function right.
I found something online, but...
Yo, you holding out on us?
Let me ask you all something.
How do you feel about
getting high with a gay guy?
The fuck do you mean, bro?
Like, sometimes I can't find anything,
so I go online and meet up with guys
who, uh, have weed.
And then what happens?
I pretend I'm gay and I smoke their weed.
What do you do when they try to hit on you?
They already tried to hit on him, stupid.
What do you think I do?
Yo, does he have enough for everybody?
I don't know. I'll ask him.
All right, we'll come with you, then.
All right.
All right.
[MUSIC PLAYING]
[WHINNIES]
Don't forget to act gay.
- Hey there.
- Hi.
How's it going?
- Good with you here.
- Yeah, you get here okay?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, um...
thanks so much for coming
all the way out here.
It's cool.
[CHUCKLES]
Sorry, but I ran into a bunch of friends
- on the way over here.
- Are you ditching me?
No, no, no, they wanna hang with us.
Hey, what's your name?
Jeremy.
Jeremy. Cool. So, we getting high?
Um, can I talk to you for a second?
Why you being so unfriendly?
They just wanna party with us.
I'm sorry, I'm not into this.
Hey, come on. Yo, stay.
- [KNOCKING]
- Please stay.
MAN: Yo, you got played. We all got played.
What happened? He wasn't attracted to you?
I guess he wasn't attracted to us.
Yo, what's plan B?
Let's find another guy.
[ALL SNICKERING]
Yo, if you want it,
you have to be serious, okay?
MAN: Hey.
Yo.
What's up?
Chilling.
Good. Good. You look good.
Thanks. So, where you from?
Jersey, what about you?
Brooklyn.
Yeah? All right.
- Are you tight?
- What?
I got a big cock.
Nah, nah, nah, nah. Change, change, change.
Yo, yo, yo, you gotta be joking, bro.
Turn this shit off, like...
I'm telling you, I can get it.
You just gotta control yourselves.
[DOOR OPENS]
Let me do this. All right?
Mom said you've gotta get
your friends out of here.
These guys? No, they're not my friends.
[ALL CHUCKLING]
[SIGHS] You guys can't hang out here, sorry.
Fine, we'll go out back.
No.
- What's the problem?
- You gotta go.
- Mom.
- Can I speak with you, please?
ALEXEI: Ooh.
[ALL LAUGHING]
- I want them out of here.
- They're harmless.
I know exactly who they are.
We aren't even doing anything.
Well, then do nothing somewhere else.
- Fine.
- You have five minutes
to make them disappear.
Yo, bro, you got a message on this site.
FRANKIE: Get up.
Oh, it's just that guy again.
MAN: What'd he say?
He wants to get high with me. Alone.
That's bullshit.
Sorry.
Let's just take it from him.
Yeah.
Why would you get high
with this guy, anyways?
And why you even prowling this site?
Nuh, I'm just looking for weed.
What's the plan?
Where do you wanna meet this guy?
Uh...
what if we brought him to the beach?
Yeah, I like that.
- Yeah, all right.
- Let's do it.
Let's do it. [SIGHS]
[TYPING ON KEYBOARD]
[LIGHTER CLICKING]
[FRANKIE KNOCKING]
- That was quick.
- Yeah, come on, get in.
Let me just smoke this first.
I don't wanna stink up your car.
You know, it actually didn't
take that long to get here.
- No?
- Yeah, it's, like,
a 15-minute drive at this hour.
- Makes sense.
- Yeah, I took the BQE
even though it said it was longer.
Did you bring the weed?
Yeah. Where we going?
You don't do this much, do you?
Why?
- Well...
- No, I do.
[CHUCKLES]
- What?
- Nothing.
Am I your type?
No.
What's your type?
Older.
Why?
So, then they don't know anyone I know.
So, you're not out.
I don't really think
of myself as gay, I'm, uh...
But you have sex with men.
Yeah.
Will you have sex with me?
- Maybe.
- [CHUCKLES]
That's okay. I like a challenge.
FRANKIE:
You're gonna wanna take the next right.
[FIREWORKS POPPING IN DISTANCE]
You're free.
JEREMY: I wish I'd brought my sweatshirt.
[CHUCKLES]
This is actually really nice.
Yeah.
You okay?
Uh, yeah.
Do you have papers?
I think I left my pipe in the car.
Uh... maybe we should just go
back to my place and smoke it.
No, this is nice.
What's going on?
Yo, he got it?
FRANKIE: Yeah, he's got it.
- Yo, just give them the weed.
- Fuck you.
Just give it to them.
FRANKIE: Check his pockets.
[MUMBLING]
Yo, I think he dropped it.
Hey! Hey, I found it.
WOMAN: Please tell me what's going on.
Just spit it out.
Please.
What is it?
