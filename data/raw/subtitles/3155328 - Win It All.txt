Cubs parking!
Easy entry and exit!
How is it going?
Forty.
"Here, sir."
- Easy money.
Money comes in every day.
Cubs parking!
Hey, Ronnie!
When I come back?
I will call you. I'll let you know.
- Good.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
A lot of people today? Yes.
It was good?
- Let's say $ 60.
- All right.
Double! Yes.
Kings and sevens. Kings and sevens win.
- Very good hand.
- Thank you gentlemen.
- You play to win.
- Yes, well ordered.
He asked for three letters.
Here the new hand begins.
I did not see him coming.
Well, it's $ 25 per head.
Thank you.
Fifteen. It happened.
- That's twenty.
- It's okay.
Good morning, Eddie. Bad night?
- How are you?
- Fine and you?
- All right.
- I'm glad.
All good?
Yes, all right. What happened?
Nothing. I can not pay you now.
- It's not enough.
- Wait. Hears.
- Do not!
- I know.
- Stop. Every day...
- Adrian, Mira.
No, that's enough.
Adrian, please.
- I was making $ 200.
- Do not.
- Enough, Victor.
- Yes please.
Do not.
I'll do? Do not pay you.
- I am sorry.
- Good.
I will starve.
- I do not care.
- How come? If you care.
- Do not.
- Do you mind.
- No, not anymore.
- All right.
I'll pay you by the end of the week.
Guaranteed.
- Stop it, Victor!
- I'll pay you.
- Yes please.
- Victor!
Cone!
Very good.
Good heavens!
- I scared you?
- What are you doing here?
- Forgives. I did not want to scare you.
- What are you doing here?
I came to say hello.
You were not home and I went in.
I do not owe you anything.
- Not a penny.
- Who said yes?
You owe me nothing.
Come on. Enter the dining room.
Come with me.
- How are you?
- A little scared, but good.
What was there?
I have a business proposal.
- I hear you.
- Very good.
I will be away for a while.
I'm sent to prison.
While not,
there is something here.
I need you to save it.
I do not want the police to have it.
Neither my friends nor
anyone, you understand?
I understand.
I'll be out.
About six or nine months.
We do not know yet.
When you leave, you give me the bag.
And I give you $ 10,000 in cash.
$ 10,000?
What's in the bag?
Do not worry about it.
Do not open it. Do not look at her. Do not
touch her. Do not even think about Ella.
Hide it and forget it. That is all.
Shit, Michael.
It's an interesting opportunity.
One could say, yes.
Yes?
- Done deal.
- Very good.
- Done.
- Done.
- All right. Ray!
- I'm your man.
Eddie, it's Ron.
I do not know if you remember me.
I left your mother's
vagina before you.
We grew up together. I am your brother.
Hi. Where are you?
We have not seen you in weeks,
and we'd like to see you.
We miss you. Your nephew misses you.
Call us. Let's dine together. Bye.
Hi.
Do what seems right to you.
Follow your instinct.
- Trust your instinct.
- It's a great decision.
Very well, I will.
Yes!
- Special caramel!
- All right.
- Uncle Eddie...
- Nice to see you.
How are you?
Very good.
Yes? Yes.
What have you done lately?
Work, have fun, save and...
Do not you park cars?
Are you parking cars? Yes.
- Not every day.
- Look!
Last season you said
it would be the last.
But this year the cubs
are doing very well.
People want to go and see them.
There are more opportunities.
And I do not reject the
money, so I accepted the job.
- In fact...
- Were you working...?
Were not you going to
open a restaurant or bar?
Arthur and I were going
to open a private bar.
We are still talking about it.
- Follow.
- We care about your career.
That you can keep
it economically.
I know. Actually...
I started a business. Thanks for asking.
- You started a business?
- A storage business.
Storage?
Yes, I started... I already have...
It is not an idea. It is real.
I have a client.
- Look!
- What?
What do you say?
I have a client who
paid me for six months.
I'm looking for more customers.
What are you talking about?
- It's strange.
- What is strange?
- Help me.
- I need a job.
Help me with the trash.
I did not come to talk about it.
Good...
- I came to be with you.
- Very good.
Do not get mad.
- No but...
- Look.
Do not let it affect you. He loves you.
And I her. You know that.
I know you know it.
Yes, but almost... you know?
I know. We care about you.
A lot.
At some point you will have to mature.
And act as an adult.
I'm serious.
You will not be able to
continue at this rate.
Listen to me.
I know I repeat myself.
Come and work for me.
Please. He would have loved to
have his children work with him.
Come on. He would have loved it.
- I do not want...
- Security and stability.
You would have a salary.
You would spend money as you wanted.
- You would have a support.
- I will not work at the chip company.
- You must build your life.
- Ron, shut up.
- It's great!
- I do not want to be a gardener.
I do not want to make a career there.
What is wrong with the company?
They built it!
I love what dad did.
It's not what I want. That is all.
You can not give me a
joint and then a sermon.
- That's how you are.
- I do not smoke so much...
- "Stop!".
- Stop.
"I can not smoke and think about my life."
Me drugs.
And now lecture me.
Shit.
Makes some delicious cookies.
Do not.
Do not do it, idiot.
Do not do it.
Do not get into this.
Do not do it.
- Did Jake hear anything?
- No, I look at things.
Bodybuilding and all that.
- Oh, my god.
- Wow...
- I am sorry.
- It would have been the end.
It's a great story.
It was not a story.
It really is.
What do we have here? A sandwich?
Twenty.
More a sandwich.
I need to buy gas.
Good shot.
Do not do it.
Do not.
Do not.
Gross.
What's up?
Shit.
Do not.
Do not.
Do not.
Do not.
What the fuck.
Do not.
This is not good.
It is not...
Fuck.
Pancake house and restaurant.
The fact that you are
considering this plan.
Means that in three weeks there
will be no money left in that bag.
Is not true.
This is going to have a happy ending.
There will be no happy ending.
Yes.
You never have a happy ending.
It's a loser attitude.
Every story you've told
me since I met you.
It's about how you were
here and you ended up here.
Because you're my best man.
Am I going to boast?
Most are victories.
- Who's your godfather?
- Your.
I?
Is not true.
- Yes.
- I'm not your godfather.
You have not been to a
meeting in six months.
Here is a system,
with concrete rules.
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm a guy you take to coffee shops.
Tell him the nonsense
you're going to do.
You expect me to accept them
so as not to feel guilty.
My godfather.
Did you learn that in the program?
What I said...
So you think he's a godfather?
I just want to get $ 500
off the bag and bet.
As soon as he wins,
I will return the $ 500 to
the bag and I will keep it.
You are a loser. You never won.
You always lose.
- A top-notch loser!
- Is not true.
That is what you are.
Pure flesh of a loser.
- You're not going to make any money!
- Maybe yes.
- Do not...
- If I return it,
and is feasible, what is the problem?
If you get $ 500, you'll get another $ 500.
- No. My limit...
- You will do it.
My limit is $ 500.
Then I do not touch it.
90% of what you said since
we sat down is nonsense!
Gene, it's an opportunity
like I've never had.
I've never had so much cash.
The opportunity you have is to
leave the bag in the closet,
do not do shit.
And collect money at the end, without risk.
Do you see it?
- You see?
- Yeah, I'm glad I called you.
I will not touch money.
Will not you touch it?
Thank you. I will not touch it.
- Fabulous.
- It's over. I needed it.
Thank you.
It's okay. I see.
Twenty one! Very good!
Nine.
- Any beer.
- Right now.
Yes!
I told you!
All this is for you.
Leave it close. Immediately
i come for more.
- Yes.
- Thank you, Paul.
Yes sir!
Let's drink! All night.
I invite. Yes.
I was scared. He was terrified.
But it was fixed.
I returned everything and won two.
Now that I've won two, it's like...
- I can jump.
- It's easy money.
Of course you can.
If I lose, I will be the
same as when I started.
Let's celebrate. Thanks for coming.
I'm glad they left.
I needed this. It feels...
- You deserve it.
- I deserve it.
Thanks guys.
Take another. All night.
Tell them what I pay.
Paul, I paid tonight.
- Yes!
- Paul!
- A beer.
- Other?
- Yes.
- A bag of cookies.
- Sorry.
- Sorry.
Forgives.
Agree. Sorry.
After you.
The location is the key.
My uncle has a place...
Ahead. Call your uncle.
Tell him it's for real. We will do it.
- Hello.
- What's up?
Serve another round of
drinks to those ladies.
I invite.
Your? That good. Yes.
You have to go and take them.
- I'm not at the tables.
- Do it for me.
Do it. When they
ask from whom...
The bar is full.
It will take you a minute.
Are they going to demand that
you serve them right away?
Do me the favor.
How many times have you come? When did
i leave the bar and take the tables?
I'll ask you... I'll pay you.
I'll give you $ 20.
I'll give you $ 20 just for that.
And I'll pay for the drinks, too.
No. We did not ask for that.
I know. They are on his side.
- Do you know him?
- Do not.
I'm going.
This is because I almost killed you.
Careless.
How are you? I've never
seen them here before.
These are my friends.
- Gentlemen! Introduce yourself.
- Hello.
We may be many.
Tonight, I pay for the drinks.
- All right.
- Totally.
Why not? If you say it.
- Eddie.
- Hello. Eve.
- Nice to meet you, Eva.
- Equally.
- Sorry about that before.
- I'm sorry.
All!
- Play here.
- Agree.
- It is normal.
- Very good.
Touch it. Yes.
And so...
Heavens!
- What is that?
- Seriously.
It's huge, is not it?
You have a sweet heart. Noticeable.
- It comes from music.
- Really?
Your way of dancing to the beat of music.
That's what changes everything.
Thanks for saying so.
No one had told me.
Press it. Come on.
- Go with the black woman.
- Which do you like?
Which do you like?
The black one.
Tell me about your friend Eddie.
Mary...
- Eddie? What do you want to know? Look.
- I don't know.
He's talking to my friend. Yes.
True?
You. Are they nurses?
They work together.
- Yes.
- Great.
- Interesting.
- I know.
Why do you like to take care of people?
I always wanted to.
Yes? Yes.
You have a huge muscle.
You can do whatever you want with it.
I don't know. I like to
take care of people.
And I like... the best... yeah?
What I enjoy of my work.
Is to teach people to
take care of themselves.
- Interesting.
- It's an attractive quality.
Well, friends.
Yes.
Yes?
You must go home. I am sorry.
- Agree.
- If it's late.
I've always been here
since high school.
Really? Yes.
Can it be to take away? Yes.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
I'm a nerd .
A very disciplined nerd.
- Have you always been disciplined?
- Yes always.
How good.
Do you believe? Yes.
Why did you go out tonight?
My friends insisted.
- They said I'm bored and...
- Yes, but why today?
- Because today you went out.
- I don't know.
You decided to go to that bar.
Why tonight?
It's a nice coincidence.
I do not believe in coincidences.
Really, I do not believe in them.
I think everything happens for a reason.
Yes me too.
I was very lucky today.
And so,
you decided to leave and you never go out!
And you went to that shitty bar.
Yes.
Really. What is the probability?
I do not know, but it was great.
It would not be repeated
in a million years!
I don't know. I find it exciting.
Sometimes, the world is perfect.
- I know.
- Other times, no.
Most of the time, no.
But when it is...
- You speak like crazy, but...
- Yes?
- I like it.
- Very good.
I had a great time.
I know.
- I had a great time with you.
- I also.
- We could repeat it.
- Of course.
- You want?
- May l...
I can give you my number.
- Yes.
- Yes?
I'll give you my phone. Mark it,
and I'll call you. Yes.
We could have breakfast one of these days.
I'm not very early riser.
Do you ever go out to lunch
or have a drink? Or...
I am very busy.
- Yes?
- So...
I'm only free in the morning. I am sorry.
- That is all? Only in the morning.
- And very early.
- How early?
- At 7:00 or 7:30.
- It's okay.
- Yes?
- It's okay?
- Yes cool.
- Agree?
- Then yes.
I'm impatient for... yes.
See you in the morning.
I will call you. We'll meet.
We'll pick one day.
- Perfect.
- Very good.
Today is the day, Eddie.
Today is the day.
They should run on the
lawn, but not today.
- They run on sand.
- All right.
- Should not have problems.
- Great.
Kit's in the fifth, right?
Yes.
All right. In the seventh...
Hi. How are you?
Come on!
Do it!
Just!
Yes. You know what? I'll bring it.
- Come on! Run!
- Go!
Heavens.
Maybe we will win.
Come on!
Nicky.
Hi.
I need a favor, my friend.
Do you still have the keys to my house?
- What about the rain?
- A storm is coming.
- Will they postpone the race?
- They 're suspended.
Yes? Shit. It's a joke?
Agree. Thank you. Shit.
It's a nightmare, damn it!
I can enter?
Yes.
Two three four five six seven...
You want it all in chips? Yes.
One, two, three, four, sir.
- Yes, give me three.
- Three?
One, two and three.
Show them. We match.
- Damned...
- Kings and three.
Double pairs. Nothing?
We have another $ 250.
- They all match.
- Another one.
I also match.
- The well is fine.
- What, not even?
How many letters?
A. If you give me the one i
need, I'll take all the money.
- The biggest hand.
- I put everything.
- Motherfucker.
- Couple of nines.
You're good. Quiet.
I stay and I get it back.
All in chips? Yes.
- He is okay?
- Great.
Give me the chips, please. Thank you.
- He passed.
- He passed.
Four up.
Pair of eights.
Pair of aces, that wins.
- I see.
- I see.
It is the parallel well. $ 500.
Two.
- One two. You want letters.
- Three.
And three nice letters.
Someone sees and climbs.
We have $ 400 plus $ 1,100.
The bet is $ 1500.
It's too much for me.
The bet is $ 1,500.
Wait. I have not seen it yet.
Do you see it or do you retire?
We see the hand. He shows them.
Yes. Strong bets.
- Damned.
- It's a joke?
It has a full, gentlemen.
Amazing.
This is yours, my friend. All yours.
I had never seen anything like it.
Amazing.
Eva: "Is breakfast still?"
Looks like you rested.
Did you have a good night? What did you do?
If I...
I took my daughter and watched
television with my mom.
So yes.
Great.
A daughter. Yes.
How...? How old are you?
Seven.
Seven?
It's already big.
The father...?
Are you married to him, or...?
Do not.
She... that is, he...
He got lost in Mexico forever.
What?
Is that normal in Mexico?
Get lost forever.
It's awful.
- He's not with us.
- No this...
It is there, and it will never come.
We have no contact.
That is a relief for someone.
For me, I suppose.
But maybe not for you, and I'm sorry.
Really? Because three women...
Its a lot...
- Yes it is much.
- To assume it.
You are ready? I do not think so.
How about if we eat breakfast
and see if we like the food?
Then we'll think about all that.
You're right.
- Sorry for the wait.
- Thank you.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Yes please. Just coffee.
You, lady?
- Orange juice. Thank you.
- To you.
I think it's great that you
start breakfast like this.
I was not entirely honest that night.
I do not have my own business.
I do not spend much.
I do not usually have that much money.
Agree.
So...
And if it's not what you
expected, I'm sorry. I cheated.
How do you win the life?
How do I make a living? Yes.
It is difficult to know today.
But after passing...
You do not seem shy at all.
Not really.
Because you are different.
I do not know why.
When you meet someone,
you are extroverted.
Yes, exactly.
If I do not know them, I'm very shy.
- I am sorry.
- Gene, do not do that.
Please.
That was a week ago.
- Gene...
- We talked a week ago.
I am sorry. I should not laugh.
I should not laugh.
- Gene.
- I am sorry. Is that...
- I'm at my worst.
- I know. I am sorry.
Help me, I beg you.
- Agree. I know.
- You're laughing at me.
Are you willing to change?
Yes, 100%
- really?
- Yes, 100%.
Are not you going to stay
here complaining and saying,
"i made bad decisions,"
then rejected my advice?
- This is different.
- But do you understand why I say it?
Do you understand my restlessness?
Yes.
Because you did it 4268
times in the past.
This is... yes.
I am totally willing to change.
I'm scared.
I never thought this would happen.
- Please.
- Good.
Lets start by the beginning.
You must admit that you're an idiot.
I admit that I'm an idiot.
I need you to say:
"My name is... and I'm an idiot."
Why?
Because that statement is real.
It becomes real.
If you are willing to humiliate yourself,
i will know that you are serious.
My name is Edward Garrett
and I'm an idiot.
All right. And now I want you to say:
"My name was Edward Garrett
and my friend gene was right."
- I'm addicted to losing.
- Why do I have to say this about you?
Agree.
My name is Edward Garrett and
my friend gene was right.
I'm addicted to losing.
- That was easy for you.
- Yes, you were right.
You must have serious problems.
Yes.
Agree.
If you laugh after all
that, I'll kill you.
Gene, this behavior is inappropriate.
I am sorry.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It makes me laugh.
- You're a bad person.
- It is not my intention. Is that...
It's not funny.
All right. We'll fix it.
I do not understand. We'll fix it.
We'll do whatever it takes.
We'll get you up.
- Agree?
- Yes thanks.
How many did you throw?
Six? All right. Nothing happens.
We can do it.
I have to ask for them.
Do you want me to go out?
No, it's no problem.
Julio is leaving.
I'll ask you to do it.
All right. Bye, Kim.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- How are you?
- No good.
What's going on?
I...
I'm in a shit situation
and I feel ashamed.
And I... what is it, Eddie?
I ended up losing money I did not have.
I owe more than $ 20,000.
- I do not have $ 20,000.
- I know.
- It's ridiculous!
- I'm not asking for a loan.
I'm not begging you.
That ended. Yes?
What did you come for?
I'm going to go to meetings
and I'm going to change.
I want employment.
I want to work for you.
Do you want to work for me?
Seriously? Yes.
- Very good.
- I need...
- Bottoms out. I know.
- Agree.
This is what we will do.
- I'll offer you a job.
- Thank you.
You will start from below, as
you would have wanted chips.
- Clear.
- Yes?
No weekly rest. Yes.
I will not give you anything.
I'll make you work hard, okay?
Yes.
If you do well, no problems
or excuses for six months,
I will lend you the part of the debt
that you do not cover with labor.
It's more than I ask, Ron.
It's what I give you, what
you take and what there is.
Are you going to work for me?
Yes.
- Seriously?
- There will be no problems.
I'm sure there will be no problems.
Yes?
Very good.
Let's do it. Yes.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Thank you.
- Seriously, no nonsense. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
You're welcome. Good.
It is done.
Because I can not take it anymore.
My heart can not stand it.
- It's the last time we do it.
- It's over.
If I'm sure.
I get it. Yes.
Very good. Shut up.
Here's the guy.
Here it comes.
Here is my man.
How you feel?
Come here. Very good.
Gentlemen, my friend Eddie.
- My brother.
- Hello.
They are Freddy, Tony and Alex. Yes?
Yes.
He is nervous.
Because he never saw the light of the day.
Or yes, but usually before bed.
Hey, he's my brother,
but that does not mean that
you can not be hard on him.
Do not be soft.
Make it work.
Agree.
Looks good. You're good? Yes.
- What is this?
- What?
It's sweat. I've never seen it before.
You've learned something.
He does not know how to
use the rake or anything.
I used another kind of rake.
This is worse.
If you cut your lawn better than you play
bowling. It's okay. Giving me a call.
- All right.
- Giving me a call.
That's my man.
- He's my man.
- Back.
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.
This is great.
Hey, I'll introduce you to Eddie.
Maybe they recognize it.
He has not come for a long time.
The important thing is that he returned.
- Yes.
- Glad to be back.
Are you coming to work?
Yes, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, lunch killed me.
You can!
- Ends.
- You must throw again.
- Again?
- Yes!
You will see.
- Well done.
- You're up!
- Good shot.
- Thank you.
Did you want to use that one?
Yes.
- Use it.
- Use the girls' ball.
My thumb got stuck.
Well, I'm going to pitch.
That hurt.
How good.
He cared about you.
That's what's important.
- Right.
- Just like my dad.
Chips cared... whatever happens,
he loved my brother and
me more than anyone.
There may be success at
the end of this tunnel.
But, for me, it was an
incredible feeling.
You feel like a child again. So.
Not even as a child.
Sometimes you feel like a baby.
As if someone else had to
take care of the situation.
"I can not do anything. What I do?".
You could go to work and make money.
But people expect things from you.
They want you to do other things. And me...
I was being childish.
- Hello.
- Hello.
I think I'm going home.
I want to see Jude
before she falls asleep.
Show me what to do with this order.
I want to do it right.
You enter in quickbooks.
You organize them, and we can
process them and send the invoices.
So, is this no longer useful?
- Yes, that is no longer used.
- All right.
Great.
I'm proud. Well done.
- Thank you. It's important to me.
- This helps us a lot.
When you're done with that,
you can throw it away.
- Great. I love.
- All right.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Greetings to all of you.
- I will do it.
Hi.
- How are you?
- What happened, Victor?
Are you going to pay today?
I'm going to pay now!
- Friend!
- That's for you, my friend.
- Agree.
- Thank you, Victor.
- The last.
- Thank you, Victor.
- My name is Eddie.
- Eddie...
- It's okay. Thank you.
- All right, Eddie.
- Thanks friend.
- All right.
- All in order.
- Very good.
- Bye. Thank you.
- Very good.
- Goodbye friend.
- Bye. I love you.
- And I to you. Bye.
- All right. Bye.
- That's why.
- Why?
Because in Mexico there
are no large tortillas.
There are only small tortillas.
How do you make a burrito
with the big ones?
- But...
- I mean, little...
They can make large tortillas.
It's not that they do not have
the technology to do them.
You are right.
In Mexico there are only small tortillas.
You are good.
We always pretend it's time.
- It's time.
- It's always beer time.
I have to go. Tomorrow, I'll get up early.
- What?
- I have to go.
He has to work in the nursery.
- Yes, art. See you, pat.
- Bye, James.
- Eddie.
- Goodbye friend.
I do not like to think that i
am addicted to the game, but...
I keep betting and losing, so...
I'm not an idiot. True?
And the feeling of having nothing, being
a loser and being without a penny.
You get into the body and...
That's the feeling I chase.
I do not want to pursue her anymore.
Because it's a horrible feeling.
And I'm here to stop chasing that
shit and straightening the course.
- My favorite part.
- Thank you.
- You earned it.
- Thank you.
I'm proud of you. Well done.
- I gave you some more.
- What is this?
I give the boys an
extra every week.
Listen, have fun on the weekend.
- Treat yourself.
- Thank you. I will do it.
See you Monday.
- Good friend.
- Very good.
Do not behave yourself.
- I have $ 200. I am rich!
- Yes!
Watch out.
- Hello.
- Hello.
You look great.
- They're for you.
- You look great.
Thank you.
Are you ready? Yes.
You know? I like the business
more than I thought.
I thought I would not like that part,
but I like it.
It is structured so that Ron owns
all of the capital of the company.
But by contract, half is mine.
His dream, and it begins to be
mine too, is that we both own 50%.
I'm going to work and
save to buy a part.
Some extra work.
We will count them as
capital up to 50%.
Then we'll run it together and
we can do whatever we want.
The business is doing very well, in fact.
But I think it could improve.
They could inherit our children and...
They want dessert?
I'll leave you some menus.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
What do you think? Do you want dessert?
- Do not.
- Do not.
- Do you like this place?
- Is not my style.
Mine neither.
I just came to impress you.
Really? Yes.
I did not know, I did not know it.
Yes.
- You know what?
- What?
I'll take you to a place I like.
Very good. Yes.
It will be fun.
- Eva, I do not want to do this.
- If you want.
- Really, I do not want to.
- You are going to do it.
- Very good.
- Not seriously.
- You have to dance!
- Very good!
All right. I'll try... dance.
- Yes?
- All right. Let's dance.
- Come on!
- Very good!
One two three. So?
- One two three.
- Yes.
- One two three. Very good.
- Yes.
- You dance very sexi.
- You say that to say.
- Is not true.
- I know. Are you ready?
- You go.
- Do not.
- Only you.
- Come on.
You go.
I have to go.
Invite me in.
You can not.
- I will not make noise.
- Do not.
Are you crazy?
"Please, let me in."
My mom and my daughter are inside.
I know, but I will be so silent
that they will not notice.
I'll leave right away.
I'll come in and leave very quickly.
- Please.
- Oh, my god. Do not.
Do not ruin it.
- Do not.
- Is soon.
- I know.
- Yes?
- I have to go.
- Wait.
Hi. What is wrong with this image?
- I don't know.
- This is in my hand, not in yours.
- I did not have the gas.
- I know. That's why I came.
That's why I spent an hour in western.
To bring you gas.
- Is that a joke, shit?
- Do not.
Are you blaming me?
- The lawn mower has gas.
- It's not my job!
I have to go to five more jobs.
Julio was at school
with a broken mower.
And the lawn in half!
It looked like an alien work!
Do not look at me like that.
It's your fault.
- Put the fumes down.
- I am sorry. Hears.
Cut me the salary.
I'm sorry I was wrong!
- Yes?
- Thank you.
I thought I had done everything.
I guess it was not like that.
I will come early and ask
as many questions as I can.
- Thank you.
- I will strive.
Thank you. I'm fucking with you.
I'm fucking with you.
I'm not mad at you.
Do you see the smile? I'm kidding.
This is what is happening.
Get the gas.
Freddy! You forgot the gas.
I brought her!
- Great.
- Very funny.
You smell a little.
- You're an idiot.
- I know.
- That goes in...
- I know where it goes!
- Jude, you can.
- Your turn.
- You can do it!
- Throw them.
Come on, Jude!
I like this.
I have a good feeling.
Very good!
- It diverts well! Is going to give it!
- He's drifting.
Yes!
All right, Ron!
Do not! Ron!
You ruined it!
Give me time.
Do not!
- I have trouble throwing with the arm!
- Do not!
All right, uncle Eddie.
Are you ready? Yes.
I think so. I see.
Go where you want to begin.
- It's okay.
- I mean...
- Amazing.
- You gave it all.
You've been in a very good mood.
You're doing a great job.
The team adores you.
Yes, they are good guys.
- Yes.
- Good guys.
It's not as bad as I thought.
You see? You just had to try it.
Working is not difficult.
- Not bad.
- It's fun.
You can do it. It's good.
Do I want to work every day?
- Do not.
- Do not.
- I understand.
- I'm glad when the day is over?
Yes. Yes.
I like to collect my salary?
Yes. Yes.
It's partly the girl you date.
It shows that you like it.
It has you spellbound.
Ron, it's fabulous.
Has it all. Yes.
Is incredible.
I had never felt this way before.
She's smart and fabulous.
Let's go slow.
We are getting acquainted.
I imagine everything with her.
I imagine everything. Yes.
- I've never felt it. It is different.
- Great. Yes.
Great to hear. Noticeable...
It helped you recover.
- Definitely.
- But it has happened before.
Something raises the mood,
but it does not work out as you would like.
Suddenly you're...
But this time it's different.
- Agree.
- That's what I'm telling you.
I'm just saying that
you've said it before,
and it could be... maybe it's different.
Eddie, you got that look and...
You're giving me a fucking lecture.
Shut up.
Shut up.
For.
Stop it, shit.
Good.
I just want to make sure you're
on the right track. That is all.
And if it's different with her, I'm glad.
And it probably is.
Maybe you should introduce us.
That would be great. Yes.
- Yes?
- Great.
- Would you like it?
- Clear.
I don't know. Anything. A dinner.
Why do not you invite her to dinner?
Could be.
We will have wine and good food.
We could meet her. I would love to.
Let's dine together.
We will go to your house.
That's what I say. Great.
Its what I say.
I'm glad you said it.
Great. Can we stop talking about this?
- It is done. Fact!
- Done!
I should have hit that half-dead.
You are so bad that you failed.
- I'm good.
- Is not true.
It's nothing serious.
- It's just fun.
- Very good.
- That's.
- I'm going to have fun.
Wait, I have to park well so you
do not laugh too much at me.
Agree.
All right. This is
what is going to happen.
Agree.
We'll go to the gate.
He will make fun of how I parked.
Then he will make fun of my clothes.
The joke will not be funny.
Then he will look at you, he
will have a revelation and say,
"you look adorable".
And you have to say, "thank you."
Then he will exaggerate and say,
welcome to the Taj Mahal.
Eddie, can you get farther
away from the sidewalk?
Very good.
Ron, she's Eva.
- My brother.
- Hello.
Eva, delighted. Welcome.
Did you buy it at ugly cost?
Great. Fantastic. Yes.
You look spectacular.
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.
Welcome to the Garrett mansion.
He has a sense of humor. How good.
- Yes.
- Welcome. Come in.
- Welcome to my humble abode.
- Very good.
Why are you trotting like that, Ron?
- I'm excited.
- Dresses?
It is exciting!
- For us too.
- I am glad.
- Our dad...
- I bet a lot.
He played a lot of
cards and lost a lot.
And while playing with friends,
papa always shouted, "chips!"
Until finally they said:
"Hey, chips, let's go to the casino."
He accepted, and so he got chips.
- Yes.
- Maybe I'm lucky.
Yes? Yes.
I do not think I'm such a good mother.
- Is incredible.
- She's an amazing mom.
Of course.
Insurance. It is difficult
to be a single mother.
Thank you. Yes.
But he sure loves Eddie.
They sure get along.
Good...
- Ahead. I do not care.
- You still do not know him.
- You have not met her?
- They do not know each other?
- Agree.
- All right.
I don't know.
Are they going slowly?
I think we have to overcome many filters.
When you have kids, so...
- I agree.
- Yes, definitely.
If this is genuine,
Eddie will have time to
get along with Ella,
but I've never introduced her to my
boyfriends or the people I date.
- Very smart.
- We think that's a good idea,
- but I wish I knew her soon.
- You would be the first.
You're a smart woman.
I will be glad to meet you.
I do not introduce Jude
to the men I go out with.
- Very good.
- It is a ruler.
I only know what is strictly necessary.
Those are tomatoes.
Look, there's a mature one.
Really? Yes.
- Is incredible.
- So is. I like very much.
Do not ruin it. I love.
- I do not mean to.
- I already know it.
I'm just saying I like it. Yes.
- Me too. It's great.
- A lot. Yes.
- It's going to be good.
- All right.
He was not scared of you.
Look. I'm not a mafioso.
Thanks for coming.
I loved it.
- Really?
- Yeah. I had a great time.
All right. I also.
I do not usually have fun
with my brother.
- But it was great.
- I know.
Thank you.
Very good.
This is the situation.
Yes?
My mom and Emma are watching a movie.
And will return in an hour.
Maybe we can...
Wait.
Maybe we can...
I do not know where I'm going.
- Here.
- Very good.
Good.
Hi.
Has a collect call from the
convict's cook county prison...
Michael.
If you want to accept
the charges, check one.
If you want to reject...
Hi, Eddie. I have good news.
What happened?
I will be released soon.
When?
In eight days.
What?
Yes, administrative things, but
they let me out of here. So...
I hope everything is fine there.
Yes cool. That's...
Are good news.
And neglect, our deal is still standing.
I'll give you your share.
Yes, I certainly would. Great. This is...
What a good day.
I wanted to get rid of
it, so it's perfect.
Very good. See you next Monday.
Yes.
Are you okay, Eddie?
I? Yes, I'm excited.
Agree.
Very good.
Beware.
- Hello friend.
- Eddie.
What's up?
You should be in ravenswood.
- You got a minute?
- Five.
- I get it.
- You're at my desk.
I know. I do not want to be here. May l...?
I do not want you here either.
- What do you do?
- Ron, I...
You must know that this is
the last thing I want to do.
There was an unexpected
and unfortunate event...
Yes, something unexpected and unfortunate:
A cutter that is not cutting.
- I'm missing a worker.
- Ron, I need you to listen to me.
What are you doing here?
Listen to me.
- The deal we made...
- Yes?
It is coming out very well.
Until now.
But it was...
I kept everything I promised.
Is not true?
Is not it true that I changed?
Yes.
Did you see a change?
- Eddie, come on...
- Listen to me!
Do not put that face. Listen to me!
I'll pay for it.
Only it will take longer.
- The same conditions.
- At six weeks?
Are you asking me to pay you
what we agreed for six months?
- Are you kidding?
- Do not!
I do not care if you
give me back quintuple.
- You think I want to do it?
- Do not! Do you think I do.
Do you know how I feel ashamed?
- Listen to me.
- Do you know how much I hate this?
- Yes. Eddie...
- Please!
- Eddie...
- Say yes!
- Say yes, Ron.
- I'm screwed up.
Say yes, Ron.
Eddie...
Do not.
The answer is no.
I am sorry. I will not give you money.
That's not the deal. It
does not work like that.
Every year hundreds of people
disappear in national parks.
You could take your car to the
rocky mountains national park.
It is not far away. You leave
it open with a lit cigarette,
- and you disappear.
- I like it.
I'll pick you up.
You go to Canada and you do whatever.
And then? What do I do the rest of my life?
It depends on you.
It is an option. Yes.
Go to Guatemala.
- What ties you here?
- All right. Stop.
- Short the grass.
- Stop.
I do not want to fake my own death.
I'm just asking for ways
to raise this money.
A good friend of mine made
$ 10,000 in two hours.
- How?
- In las Vegas. He has abs.
- If we paint abs...
- Arthur, shut up.
I'm serious.
You have money.
We bought a package.
We fill it with talc and things
like that and we sell it.
We are not going to dedicate
ourselves to selling cocaine.
- Do you want to live or die?
- I...
What's wrong with selling Coca?
Nothing.
You sell them to executives from
the Chicago stock exchange.
Yes. Those guys are expendable.
Do not push it!
We are not going to sell Coca. Stop!
I need a realistic option.
- Come on the offensive.
- Agree.
He bursts into his house. Come on.
- When he arrives at night.
- Good idea.
- It's the worst idea.
- Three rabbits in a row.
- Dead. With blood on his face.
- Yeah, it's crazy.
Point out that you are a
worshiper of the devil.
Laugh, but it's the
best idea I've heard.
- The best that has come to us.
- If that's the best...
Make an application.
Those guys make a lot of money.
- An app?
- The business is saturated.
- What?
- The business is saturated.
What does that mean?
Too many people are making apps.
There are too many applications.
Make a good one.
Yes? How?
He does not know anything about technology.
- Cut the grass.
- It was an idea.
Make an application for that.
- What a good idea.
- Not bad.
- I like it.
- It is not good.
- I'm screwed up!
- Good...
- I hear you.
- I'm sorry, but I'm fucked.
Lower your voice.
- I hear you.
- Gene.
- Listen to me.
- I hear you.
- Hears!
- I hear you.
- I'm scared.
- I hear you, but lower your voice.
You must lower your voice, okay?
I have neighbors and a son.
You must lower your voice.
- And you must listen to me.
- I hear you.
- I did everything you said.
- Take it easy.
I'm calm.
I'm calm? Yes.
- Just relax.
- Very good.
I did everything you said.
I did everything my brother said.
- I went to meetings.
- Damn it, Eddie.
But I've never been so fucked up before.
And I need a plan b now.
Now, gene. I have no idea
and I am very scared.
Very good. Listen out.
Whatever the problem, it
will not get worse tonight.
It's 2:30 A.M. m. It will
not get any worse now.
I need something already.
Now I can not give you anything.
I can not. I'll give it to you
tomorrow at the meeting. I promise.
- The fucking meeting.
- Fuck that.
No, fuck it. Look at me.
Fuck the meeting.
Call me at 7:00 A.M. m.
- And we'll think about it.
- I'm calling you now.
You can not call me now
because I have a son.
I have neighbors.
I can not get you inside.
- Good.
- Yes?
I have recomposed my life.
- I got it back.
- Agree.
- Yes? Listen out.
- All right.
- Listen out.
- All right.
Wait until the meeting
- and we fixed it.
- I'm sorry I came.
I'm fine.
We are fine.
Hi, Eddie.
- Do not!
- Shit, Eddie!
- Do not!
- We gotta get you out, Eddie.
We must expel you.
- Two weeks.
- Do not!
- Stay away for two weeks.
- Do not!
- We gotta get you out, Eddie.
- Do not!
Go home. You're drunk.
Eddie, get out of here.
- Come back in two weeks!
- Do not!
Yes? Get out of here.
Get out of here. You're drunk.
Go home. Eddie.
Go home.
- Fuck off.
- Long.
Fuck off! Yes.
What do you think? Eddie
Eddie.
Eddie, can you hear me?
What was he talking about?
To have dinner together.
Yes.
- I would love to.
- With Emma?
Yes.
When?
Weekend.
East? Yes.
When? What a night?
On Sunday.
All right. What time?
- For dinner.
- Tell me to what time.
- Hour.
- At 7:00?
- At 7:00.
- Maybe.
- Well, I'll be there at...
- You want?
Yes, of course I want.
- I'm dying to meet her.
- Very good.
What good news.
I'm excited too. Will be great.
It seems perfect.
- Very good.
- I'm impatient.
It's good that you had that time.
Yes, it was great. Yes.
- Yes.
- Fabulous.
Take care.
- Nice to see you.
- Bye.
- Beware.
- I'm glad to see you.
Very good.
Are you hungry?
- Yes.
- Let's go from here.
Yes.
We are going to eat something.
Yes?
I must say that I like to have a job.
I like to go up in that company.
I like having a girlfriend.
I like to feel like an adult.
And not as if he were a degenerate.
I do not wanna bet.
I do not feel the need.
I do not want to be...
I do not want to be in that world.
And even if I wanted to, I could not
because I can not go to my casino.
I was forbidden to enter.
I do not know how, but I have to earn
all that money before Monday and...
I'm lost, gene.
Agree.
I'll tell you right now.
The worst thing a godfather can tell you.
There's a game I can get you into.
It's my old game.
The stakes are very strong.
You can make lots of money very fast.
But you can also
lose much as fast.
Yes?
I must tell you.
Believe me that, from what you told me,
if you lose, you will
have to leave the city.
Do not... yes.
Do not go through the exit box.
Do not go to your house.
- Very good.
- Go away.
I guess I'm telling you...
You know...
If you want me to call, I will.
Call. Yes.
- I do not see what other option...
- I do not want to, but call.
Yes.
It looks like a scary picture.
Where we are?
In the residential area.
We left the city.
This is very scary.
When we enter,
you will be my collector, my muscle.
- Yes.
- It is important.
That you always stay to my right.
And hold the bag.
When I go get money, you give it to me.
It must flow very well.
Many guys will have one.
It is important that it seems
that we have done it before.
- Very good. Yes.
- Do you understand?
We look like the men in black.
Now I have doubts.
I do not want to be a man in black.
We dressed smart.
We know what we do.
Do not say that in there.
I do not want them to think about it.
Tomorrow at 7:00 I have a dinner.
We have 24 hours to earn that money.
Grand appliances and TV.
I feel good.
Proof. Yes.
Hi.
- They're just appliances.
- I already know it.
I have no idea.
Yes.
Eddie Garrett.
- Who is he?
- My collector.
- What is a collector?
- You do not know?
The one who takes all my money.
We do not have anyone else on the list.
Come on, man.
We drove from the city.
I thought I might come in.
Come on.
Thank you.
Hi. They want to drink something.
Yes. A whiskey.
They play hold'em, right?
Yes it is.
Why at that table?
It should be in the long run.
The owner decided.
But it's not a hold'em table.
It's strange, is not it?
I don't know. It is the
table that the owner likes.
I would not worry.
I do not worry, but it's
not a hold'em table.
There is a free place.
Yes.
- Do it fast.
- It's $ 500.
Are they dollars?
- Five.
- Yens.
All right. Bet.
The blues brothers!
They still owe you money.
Very good.
- I like your shoes.
- Thank you.
It's 15.
It's $ 15,000.
The bet is $ 15,000.
I thought there were five of them.
Not tonight.
- Fifteen.
- Are they 15?
Game for adults.
- We played like that the last 24 hours.
- All right. Save me the seat.
They say that they are 15.
Fifteen more, or in total?
- What?
- Fifteen more or 15 in total?
They said that... I already put
five, so there are ten more.
- Very good.
- And they act like imbeciles.
Guy said something about
the blues brothers.
- Do you want us to leave?
- Do not.
I will not leave now.
Get your hands off.
I can not spend so much time doing this.
Besides, you should have everything ready.
It is part of the matter.
The guy runs like a god.
Tokens, please.
He also lies now.
- Yes.
- You lied to that?
- It's $ 15,000. Luck.
- Thank you.
- Yes.
- Well done.
You can cut your hair with that money.
Pitbull is not joking.
Welcome, sir. Yes.
- I'm Brad.
- Hello. I am Eddie. Charmed.
- The chips and the money.
- Small, big.
- How much is it?
- At $ 1,750.
Equal.
I go up.
It is cheaper to retire.
If you retire, you do not win.
All right, I'm leaving.
- Small, big?
- You had a four. It was no use.
- Did you have a king?
- Do not.
With a partner, you had the best hand.
I had it. Shit.
They are good letters.
Thank my lord.
Straddle?
Yes.
Let them be $ 1,000.
Well, we have a well.
It has to be a joke.
I retire.
Can I enter the end?
- Clear.
- All right.
Fifteen, Nick.
Fifteen fewer.
- Ten.
- Very good.
The bet is $ 700.
That's five.
Records!
Fifteen.
It's $ 15,000. Good luck, sir.
Thank my lord.
I'm going with $ 4,000.
$ 4,000? Yes.
- $ 4,000.
- $ 4,000.
It is a very good card.
I'll go ahead and bet whatever it is.
What is that?
Are you betting on some logic?
Or simply...?
You bet on everything? Yes.
Do not you even think?
You throw a coin in the air.
Two for $ 10,000.
Do not fuck with me.
You do not have a queen.
Find out for $ 10,000.
I go with everything.
All.
I cover it.
- Let's see.
- By...
- I am sorry.
- Good hand.
Save me the seat.
Seat saved.
Motherfucker.
They are playing like crazy, and I do
not want to toss one coin at a time.
I can not do it.
I'm too scared.
If I had known, I would not have come.
Damn... this is...
So...
I have to flee.
I must leave the city.
I have money to start.
I do not know where the
fuck I'm going to go.
Hi, Eddie, it's Emma.
My mom and I...
Well, technically, my mom...
Ask if you prefer chicken or steak.
I want to meet you.
Send me a message, okay?
Tell me what you prefer.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Let's play the cards.
Tokens, please!
- How many?
- A lot!
He is Jamie. It is at your service.
Jamie! "How are you, knight?"
I walk up and up.
If Stan bet, me too.
I told you. King, nine.
That gave you problems.
That's why I smiled.
Very good. I'm going to take a break.
Brian will replace me. Luck.
This is for you.
- Health.
- Health.
I had a ladder.
You should retire.
Do you walk or bet?
He passed.
The Ace is here.
He passed.
You are next.
We must see it.
- Let's see.
- You want?
Take it off.
Check it out.
How sensual.
- Yes!
- Come on!
- I win! The highest color!
- And the last!
Yes!
Of doses and tens...
- Amazing. - Shit!
Yes. I got the lost back.
I did it.
I did it. That time was $ 6,000.
- Let's move on.
- I've got 100 more. I did it, shit!
You should have seen that hand.
I made them dust.
Let's move on. Take the money.
Yes.
I find it hard to breathe.
- Ray...
- What?
- If I were...
- Let's move on.
Yes I go. Hold on. One second.
- Give him his money.
- Do not!
Wait. I did not say that.
- Do not...
- I enter.
- It will be right back.
- Cover it up.
- I feel strange.
- Let's move on. You did.
We have a lot of money.
Give him the money.
Wait. Do not! I did not say...
- Wait! I do not want to go out.
- Give it...
I do not want...
Hears. It's over.
It is a mistake that I leave now.
I'm serious.
- Two more hands.
- Do not.
I play a couple more. If I lose...
- Come on.
- I feel like I have...
- You have the money.
- I know.
And I have 100 more.
So I play until...
Just a moment.
- Shit.
- Are you crazy.
- I had...
- Give it...
Give him the money.
He's giving me a heart attack.
He's giving me a heart attack!
It hurts a lot, shit!
I'm dying.
Help me, I'm dying.
Can you call 911?
Give her your money!
Do not die.
Please! Faster!
I can not exceed 80 km /
h in this neighborhood.
I do not want to die!
Not yet!
Do not!
Do not!
Heavens.
How are you?
All right. I mean...
You will be fine.
They say you'll get well.
- Yes?
- You're good.
I'm fine? Yes.
All right. Nicky told me.
I'm not that person anymore.
I swear, I'm not like that anymore.
I know.
- Really, it's not like before.
- Agree.
I want to go to work
and enter the company.
And so it will be.
- I'm sorry.
- Really?
- If it is okay.
- All right.
Do you say it because I'm in the hospital?
Maybe a little.
Because the robe suits you.
I'm taking you by the hair
I'm serious. That's me.
You're good. Everything is fine, okay?
I'm glad you're back.
- Do you know what time it is?
- 6:30.
- What's going on?
- Can you give me my phone?
I must call Eva.
I should see her at 7:00.
Today I will meet your daughter.
The phone was not there.
They are the wallet, the
keys and the chain.
But not the phone.
- It's okay.
- Not well.
I call it. Is nothing. Just relax.
Do not give you another attack. I call her.
What is your number?
I do not know by heart.
- Do not?
- It's on my phone.
Do not you remember her number?
- What's wrong?
- This is not the time to bother me.
I remember my girlfriend's high
school number. I am sorry.
- I can take. Come on.
- We have to go now.
- Right now.
- We'll be late anyway.
Careless. We're leaving.
I carry you. You're going to look elegant.
- Leave the gown.
- I'm not going to leave it to me.
- Leave her alone.
- Do not.
Well, right there. Yes.
Perfect.
Hey, Ron. Thank you.
- I love you.
- And I to you.
- Very good.
- Very good.
- I will explain you.
- Seriously?
- Let me explain you.
- You're 45 minutes late.
I did not want to be late.
- I called you...
- I know.
But I did not have the phone.
My phone was in one
place, and I in another.
- No more excuses.
- I do not...
He had a heart attack.
- What?
- He had a heart attack.
I had... I had a problem with the heart,
I fell to the ground and
was taken to the hospital.
Oh, my god.
Here is the proof.
- Yes.
- You're good?
Physically I'm fine.
- I must follow up...
- Enters.
Missing analysis.
- Do not...
- Tell me later.
Agree. But no...
- Agree. - Good.
- Look who's here.
- Here they are. Hello!
- Hello.
- How are you?
Nice to meet you.
Equally.
I heard you speak very well. Yes.
Thank you.
- How are you?
- Fine and you?
- Nice to meet you.
- Equally.
I was dying to meet you.
Did you die? I'm dying to meet you.
I've wanted to meet you for a long time.
I can not believe I'm seeing you.
It's great for me. Thank you.
Do I sit here? Yes.
Very good.
There's $ 400 more.
What?
It's all money.
I counted it twice.
But there are $ 400 more.
How?
- I do not know.
- How it happened?
Has no sense.
If you like, I'll tell you again.
- Yes, tell it again.
- Very good.
Fuck, man.
