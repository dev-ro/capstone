(Waves crashing)
(Seagulls crying)
(Heavy panting)
(Helicopter whirring)
(Shop doorbell rings)
- Hi Mr..
- Zabek.
- ...Zabek.
- Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.
- Find it alright?
- Yes, I'm so sorry. I was...
No, don't worry. Traffic's
murder around here.
Did you find somewhere to
park?
Yes, yes I did. Yeah.
Well, take a look around,
you know.
Yes it's er...
It's quite a place here, innit?
Look at these two, eh?
Oh my. Are they real?
Yeah. They're Indonesian.
(Reptile hisses)
See they're a couple.
- They're a pair.
- Oh yes.
Oh yeah.
They come together.
You know what I mean.
The big ones have been
known to eat sheep.
And they have eaten kids.
How do they get them in their
mouths?
Well , you know, they just open
their mouth and ...
I like them
I just -
I have to admit I'm really
nervous.
Why you doing it then?
Oh it's not for me.
It's for my kid.
Oh okay. Obsessed is he?
- Yes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
They're like that,
aren't they, little boys.
They get obsessed
with things.
They're obsessed with spiders
and then lizards and..
- Guns
- Guns, yeah, all that.
Here, look at this.
What can we see in there?
That is my big fat snake.
Oh yes
Looks quite slimey doesn't it.
But it's not.
It's very smooth.
Do you want to touch it?
No.
Right.
Say hello
to my little fat furry friend,
- Penelope.
- Well you see my son's eight.
And...
I think really he'd like
something very special.
Well I can show you
my private collection.
If you like.
Yes?
- Yes please
- Yes.
OK ...
Watch the maggots.
Horrible, horrible little
things...
What do you think?
I - I don't know what I'm
looking for.
She's pregnant
- Like me
- Like you.
Beautiful ...
Now I can't make you hold her,
but, there's one down here
which you will be holding ...
Where are you, little bitch.
Come here.
Come and say hello.
Come on.
Is she dangerous?
Yes ...
Come on.
Where are you?...
Come out and get on with it.
(Groaning)
(Groaning)
(Thudding)
 Listen, Mummy.
 That's how I was made.
 You can forget about that
 ever happening again.
 Selfish bastards.
 No considerations.
 We may as well not exist.
 But shh,
 I'm here.
I have mascara days like that.
Very smudged.
(Humming quietly)
This is not going to hurt one
little bit.
- They said that last time.
- Did they?
It did hurt and I had
a massive bruise.
It was, like, here to
about there.
Oh poor you.
That's not very good is it.
Probably not in control of their
apparatus like nurse Jennifer.
Lovely. So,
I managed to track down
your records,
you're not very easy
to track down.
I felt a little bit like
Sherlock
and you was like the
disappearing woman.
Lady Lucan I think we'll
call you from now on.
Yeah, can you just call me Ruth?
Yes, of course. Ruth.
So ...
Did you know that if you hear a really
high pitched sound later on in pregnancy,
you can just start spurting
milk from your boobs?
Like two rockets. It's like
boom, boom, pow!
It's quite magical.
Why are you telling me that?
Just so that you know
you have absolutely no control over
your mind or your body any more.
This one does.
She's got all the control now.
She'll be coming ...
OK, so I didn't have much time
with the notes.
Phyllis gave them to me this
morning.
What does your partner do, Ruth?
(Humming)
... Oh.
Oh.
I'm very sorry.
I didn't know, I wasn't aware.
Well how would you know because you
don't actually know me do you?
No.
It's very important to let the
past stay in the past.
It's just nature's way.
I think nature is a bit of cunt
though, don't you?
Oh, negativity is not good for
the baby's spirit.
- Do you think?
- Yes,
I think it's good to try to
stay positive ...
And at the end of the day
you've got this force of
nature now inside you.
Baby knows what to do.
Baby will tell you what to do.
I think she already does.
Erm, it's just here.
(Loud disco music)
Scream if you want to go faster.
It's DJ o'clock.
 Empty. Dead
 Like a graveyard.
The atmosphere in here
tonight is electric.
Can I get a big oy- oy? ...
Remember, guys, tickets
available for halloween.
Raise your hand if you want one.
They're available at the bar.
Any requests, come up to the
booth.
I've got nearly every song.
Alright?
Y'alright?
- Do you want a drink?
- Eh?
Do you want a drink?
No, I'm alright. I don't
drink on Tuesdays.
- You don't drink on a Tuesday?
- No.
Why?
No, I have a code. And I don't
drink when I'm up there.
- Are you a pussy?
- What?
Are you a pussy?
Jesus Christ.
If it will shut up.
- YOLO
- What?
YOLO.
- What's that mean?
- You only live once.
That's actually something I
always say to people.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's something
of a motto of mine.
So yeah, I'll drink to that ...
Actually tasted like water.
Do you want another one?
You trying to get me drunk?
Yeah.
You're a bit forward aren't you?
Some might say.
Alright, I'm just going to lay
my cards on the table here
because
I don't want to lead you up
the garden path.
But I'm not after a relationship
and I'm not after any sort of
girlfriend
or any baggage to carry round
with me.
So, I'm sort of a bit too young
for all that sort of stuff,
you know? I'm still playing
the game, I'm, you know,
still a weekend warrior.
If you're after something a bit
more serious
because your body clock's
clicking on and all that
sort of stuff..
Then it ain't me, I don't want
any part of that.
You couldn't be more wrong.
- Oh really?
- We're the same.
You don't know anything
about me.
I know enough. I've been
watching you
- Oh have you?
- Yeah
What do you see?
I like what I see.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
John, can I get another -
actually I tell you what,
let's get four.
Couple of shots there, girls?
The thing is I want to get
the girls beyond there a drink
as well, you know.
Just so I'm not putting all my
eggs in one basket ...
Girls, come on.
That's it. Lovely. Look at that.
1, 2, 3. Here we go ...
That was nice wasn't it.
Oh gosh. I'm so sorry.
Fucking hell.
What's wrong with them?
They're both really pretty.
I mean, definitely prettiest
girls in here, but,
neither of them want to... You
know, they've just like got no
banter, have they?
They don't know what they're
missing out on, do you know
what I mean?
Yeah, I mean, I was thinking of
that in my own head.
Yeah, well I love your music.
- Do you?
- Yeah
- Do you like 70s music then?
- I love 70s, 80s
- Do you?
- Yeah.
It's my favourite too. 70s is
where my heart is.
You know what I really admire
about you?
Go on.
You know your onions.
Well that's a really nice
thing for you to say.
I thought you were probably
going to say something about
my clothes
or my face or something.
You look a bit familiar.
- You from around here?
- No, no.
Met you before?
Don't think so. I'd have
remembered.
Shall we get another drink?
No, no that's good. Get her a -
- Red wine
- Really?
- I'm on the dark side.
- Well if it's fun that
you're after,
you've come to the right place.
Show me what you've got.
(Funky disco music)
(Funky music continues)
(Slow dance music)
I fucking love fat birds.
You know?
Fucking really like them.
You've got a little bit more
about you.
You're a little bit more open
minded.
You don't mind what people
do to you, do you? ...
(Wretching)
(Wretching and gagging)
(Groaning)
(Burping and spitting)
Fucking hell.
Don't know why that made me feel
all -
Sort of weird, it turned me on.
Being sick.
It's probably the gag reflex or
something like that.
Sorry did I get some on your
face?
I thought I had beer here but -
Do you think every human has
needs, Dan?
We haven't got any beers. I
thought I been out and got some
but I must have drunk them
before.
There's half an egg sandwich
there if you want it though.
Do you think that every
individual needs food,
sex,
love?
Of course. If you don't have all
those things, you're going to
die, aren't you?
Would you die without love, Dan?
I'm too young to die.
Have you got anyone who loves
you?
Yes, of course I have.
I've got my mother, haven't I?
She loves me.
- Does she?
- Yes, of course she does.
Mums love sons, that's how the
world works, innit?
Parents love their kids.
Didn't you know that?
It's not rocket science.
This is all getting very
serious.
You're putting a downer on the
evening.
I was really looking forward
to getting back here
and having some fun.
I tell you what, I'll put on a
bit of music for us.
What sort of stuff do you like?
Dirty dancing, do you know that
one?
Course I do, I'm not retarded.
What about Grease? I like
Grease. That always puts me in a
good mood.
- A bit of summer lovin'.
- It's not summer, is it?
And you're not Olivia
Newton- John. You
look more like Elton John.
Glass houses.
A right weird fucker you, aren't
you?
A strange bod.
Right, I tell you.
Here's one for you.
"I got it bad. You
don't know how bad I got it."
What's this song? You know it? I
love that fucking tune.
It's one of my favourites.
"I got it bad. You don't know
how bad I got it."
"You got it easy. You don't
know when you got it good.
It's getting harder, just
keeping life and soul together.
I'm sick fighting, even though I
know I should."
"It's getting harder, just
keeping life and soul together.
... spirit is frozen to the
core...
I don't wanna be here no more...
Do you want kids, Dan?
God! What's wrong with you?
What about kids?
What about them?
No, I fucking hate kids,
they're annoying,
they're small,
they get in the way of stuff.
I've got things to do with my
life.
Don't you want to share
your life with anyone?
No, not with kids, I don't.
I don't know.
I'm DJ Dan.
I'm at the fun -
the fun bus.
That's what I'm all about. Get
on there.
Let's stop fannying around
and let's have a look at your
fanny.
Let's have a little butchers at
what you're holding down there.
You're very selfish aren't you?
No, I'm not. How am I selfish?
We said we wanted the same thing
when we was back at there.
- You're selfish -
- Who are you?
Fuck me, she's all I need.
I'm Paula.
Give me a second would you?
Sort this bag out.
Come on.
Come on, you.
Let's just get you to bed,
shall we?
I've got to do the washing.
No you haven't. Last thing you
need to do at this time of night
is the washing.
That's why I've got no clothes,
you've washed them all to
bugger, ain't you?
Get in there, get in bed.
Finish your chores tomorrow.
This place is a shit tip. Get
in bed, I don't want to hear
another word out of you.
 You see. These are the sort of
 people we're dealing with.
You never said your name was
Paula.
Where were we? I tell you what.
I cannot wait to see you naked.
Cramps your style a bit,
doesn't she.
No, she just lives here.
We get on, you know?
Oh yeah. You smell like a
stripper.
I fucking love that smell.
Fucking slutty and dirty.
You're filth aren't you?
Do you always talk to her like
that?
Yeah, the sad thing is you know,
I'm an only child so
I get everything when she's gone
and that won't be too long.
She's at that moment and
everything's going, you know?
I'm going to come at you
like a dog.
Do it.
You're bad ain't you. You're
a really bad girl.
Oh! Something moved down there.
That's not right.
Are you fucking pregnant? ...
Fuck!
What you fucking doing?
What've I done?
It's messy isn't it?
Relationships,
kids and
responsibilities.
What would you know though?
You avoid all that, don't you?
Need a bit of bleach on there.
Who are you?
I'm Ruth.
So, let's get you into bed, mum?
I've got to do the washing.
Danny's run out of knickers.
Don't worry, I'll put the
washing on.
Aw, you're lovely,
you're an angel.
Michelle.
- Yeah.
- I think you should leave
Danny.
You're too good for him,
Michelle.
I know.
Come on, let's get you in.
Pop your feet in then.
- Thank you.
- Nice and cosy. Got your
teddy.
Thank you.
Do you not want a hot chocolate
or anything?
No, thank you. I'll go to sleep
now.
Alright
Good night, darling.
(Singing quietly)
Ungrateful bastard.
 - You're getting better
 at this.
- Do you think so?
 Oh yes
I do too
I think I'm changing.
Into something else.
It's because of you.
 I'm tired.
Knock, knock ...
Don't do anything.
It's you who needs to act Ruth.
 Remember.
 Remember what they did ...
 They're out there.
 The rest of them.
 They cut my daddy down in his
 prime.
 With only a thought for
 themselves.
 People think babies are sweet.
 But I'm bitter.
Hello, good evening.
Hi, I'm here to see Ella
Harding.
- Thanks so much. Could you
tell me what floor she's on?
- She's on the second floor.
 These people.
 They make decisions
 about who survives
 and who dies.
 Some of them
 are women.
 Oh yes.
 We can be the worst.
 The coldest.
 The most merciless.
 The most
 ruthless.
Any questions, just...
Hang on.
Okay sorry. Take your time.
To be honest,
I don't know what we were
thinking.
Thanks for seeing me by the way
so late in the day.
It's not because it's the
end of the day...
Siobhan.
Is it this? Is it the pregnancy?
Not directly.
- But it's a tricky decision
for a company.
- I understand.
I mean you'd be taking your
maternity leave as soon as
you've unpacked your stapler.
- Which isn't a problem per se.
- What is the problem per se?
I just - well I don't know,
I just don't...
Maybe I've got a wrong star sign
or something.
Yeah, you're not a Virgo are
you? ...
No, listen.
We've clients come in and I'm
not like this
but we have clients come in and
they're so stupid.
They'll be thinking stuff like -
is she going to turn up at the
courtroom or is she going to be
off giving birth in a teepee?
You know, stuff like that.
- People are such idiots.
- Yeah, I guess I was being
a bit naive.
- We need the money.
- Well it's a cutthroat world.
Yeah.
I've actually had to make cuts
already, very, very harsh cuts.
And it's been awful,
really awful.
 I told you -
 she's a merciless,
 frigid bitch.
Anyway, sorry but I've got to
get on.
Do you always work late,
alone?
Yes.
Well I've got my priorities.
Don't you do anything else?
Well of course.
Well
I've got a dog.
Walk him.
Do my food shop - I've got to
eat.
I go on an odd activity weekend.
- I don't take them seriously
or anything, but...
- Why would you?
- I'm so busy.
- You must be.
I let my friend convince me to go
on one of those skydiving things,
I mean can you believe it?
Who does that? I mean it's
crazy, but I did it! I did it!
- Skydiving!
- Yeah!
- Oh right.
- It was mental.
Who pays someone to throw them
out of an airplane?
It's not a substitute for a
personality is it?
 Sad,
 lonely
 woman.
 Be ruthless, Ruth.
Anyway, I'm sorry
I wasted your time.
A little word of advice.
Get it out of your system, the
motherhood thing. You know?
Sort out your own business
before you interfere
in other people's.
Oh I will ...
(Gasps)
I'm sorry, Ella. I've had to
make some really harsh cuts.
It's a cutthroat
world, you know?
You know you should
get out more and have more fun.
I really believe that.
Because activity weekends -
you're never going to get a shag
on those.
Might see if I can...
It's a nice chair actually.
Where can I get one of these?
(Classical music playing)
 That
 was perfect.
(Classical music continues)
 Don't get too cocky.
 You'll stand out from
 the crowd.
 Remember who's the mastermind.
 You wouldn't have done it
 without me,
 would you?
 Would you?
 It was a group decision.
 It was a matter of life or
 death.
 It's a tragic
 incident and people are aware
 of the dangers but just...
 We were unlucky today. Very
 unlucky, you know.
 In these situations there's
 nothing you can do really.
Nothing you can do.
Dead eyes.
Dead eyes.
- Tom, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Hi!
- Hi!
We spoke on the phone.
Ah, yes. Yes, how are you?
- I'm good. How are you?
- Well.
Yeah, I'm just here for the
induction, so...
What sort of level were you
interested in?
Well, I'm a beginner but I feel
quite confident actually.
I feel like I'd like to go quite
advanced.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Your first time.
So you wouldn't know what to do
with this equipment?
You know, I'm kind of - I've
been reading up about it, so..
Um, I mean, this is um, like,
this is a kind of safety rope,
isn't it?
It's a rope.
Kind of think you wouldn't put
more than seven people on this.
Sorry, what are you getting at?
Are you here for a lesson?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Yeah.
The thing is that I couldn't
teach you,
because of your
current condition.
Alright, look, don't worry about
that. Because um,
the thing is I am really fit.
I have been up to all sorts. You
would not believe what I've been
doing recently.
Sure, but if something were to
go wrong
then I'd be to blame, you know?
You'd be to blame,
yeah.
Have you been to blame many
times before?
Sorry, my 8pm is here.
Sorry I couldn't teach you.
That's alright.
- Didn't have a problem
earlier, did you?
- I didn't... I'm sorry.
You knew I was pregnant, you
were still going to teach me.
It's very slippery.
No.
No!
I'll do it.
I promise.
I'm trying ...
You fucking do it.
I'm trying.
Just bring you up a little bit
today, Ruth.
So I can have a feel around.
See how the baby is.
Oop, there we go.
Sorry, that's -
that a bit better?
Bit far down now.
I'll pop you back up.
All these new technical things
do bother me. How's that?
- Yeah, that's good.
- Lovely.
Alright, so I'm just going to
lift your top up.
There's a - I like to do this.
Get my hands warmed up. My mum
taught me this.
Don't learn that at college.
Okay
I'm just going to press here,
down the side.
There you go.
Ooh, there you go.
She doesn't like that.
I'm just feeling for the head.
Well it's in this area.
It's in the stomach area.
Even I know that.
Yeah
Don't worry, she's got a head.
She's thinking all the time, a
bit too much.
We discussed blood pressure
didn't we last time.
To monitor your blood pressure.
So are you looking after
yourself, eating well -
how are you sleeping?
Well she's not really letting me
sleep, so..
- No?
- No.
And that's affecting your
mind,
your rationality.
Just have to
make a few notes, you see,
I have to monitor this.
It's my job to
keep track of everything.
What do you mean?
Well if there's anything
untoward or anything difficult
occurring,
I need to get in touch with
social services.
No! I don't want you to report
it to social services.
- Well...
- Why would you report it to
social services?
Only if there's something that's
bothering you but we need to
make sure that you're...
No, no, no. I don't want you to
becontacting social services.
At all.
It's not personal, we do it
with everybody.
It's just so that we can see
that you're alright and...
No, no, no. They interfere
and mess around, I mean what we
talking about here?
We're talking about, what
we talking about?
We're talking about like
adoption, aren't we?
- No. Not at all.
If you tell social services
about me, we're talking about
adoption.
- Look, you're alright.
- And I know what they do.
Take a seat.
What they do is they give your
baby, they steal it from you
and they give it to some fucking
child- hungry middle- class
couple
and then I won't get to see
the baby again.
Do you know what it's not even
going to happen
because this baby is attached to
me with a fucking cord.
She wouldn't even let it happen.
That's not going to happen,
Ruth.
You have to trust me.
You have got to start thinking
about what's best.
It's all about you and your
choices.
Sit down.
What do you mean?
What I mean is
nobody
is going to take this baby away
from you -
if you make the right choices.
You have to decide what is right
and what's wrong.
Send me a sign.
(Thudding)
 Loneliness,
 it's the worst.
 But luckily, you'll never be
 alone. Because you've got me.
 Isn't that great?
 I despise crowds.
 Look at this lot.
 Out on the rape.
 The next morning they'll all
 be "It wasn't me".
 Animals.
 A fucking zoo this town.
 A kind soul
 is as rare
 as a unicorn.
Claire?
Yeah.
I'm Josh.
Oh, hi.
Not who you're expecting?
No, but that's fine, so...
Come in anyway.
This is lovely!
Yeah, welcome.
The spare room's upstairs.
There's extra rooms up there as
well.
Zac's room's up there.
Yeah, Zac's buddha's in there.
Pride of place for some reason.
- OK!
- Look, I'm just in the middle
of cooking.
Do you mind if I stop it
burning?
- Go for it.
Is it OK if I just put my stuff
down?
Yeah, yeah of course, make
yourself at home ...
- This should be alright.
- Really lovely.
Thank you.
Yeah it's quite, it's all
chilled out, it's a nice spot.
Yeah Zac isn't here I'm afraid.
No rush.
He's not here much to be honest,
OK.
Which means he never cleans,
but...
- That's a bit annoying.
- Oh no! It's never messy,
I do it.
OK.
- Yeah. He's...he's lovely,
he's lovely.
- Yeah.
- He's just kind of a bit away
with the fairies.
- Fickle.
- No, he's kinda
head- in- the- clouds.
- Flawed.
- He's always got projects...
- Bit of a pig.
- No no no he's a lovely boy
to live with really.
- OK, great
Yeah. I mean do you want to sit
down?
Erm, yeah.
Sorry I don't mean to pry, but
what's, you know...
Yeah, ok, I -
I was with someone
and you know we were committed
and everything and he said he
was ready
and then about a third of the
way into the pregnancy he
changed his mind.
And he ran off with
a 23 year- old...
- Shit.
- ...TV researcher with tattoos
and you know it was his flat so
I had - I got chucked out
basically.
Yeah.
That's horrendous.
No I mean, don't worry, don't
worry about it obviously,
- 'cause people have been
really kind so...
- Have they?
It doesn't sound very kind.
I'm sorry but people can be just
so fucking selfish.
Yeah, they can.
Sorry, makes me feel sick.
Well I, I like kids. So, you
know.
Yeah I've got a little niece
actually.
That's her - I look after her
all the time. And that little...
- Oh that so sweet.
- I'm mad uncle Josh,
and yeah I love it.
I love it yeah.
I mean it's a bit different
living with one though,
isn't it.
I mean they just take over your
life, really.
Then you have to kind of
hand yourself over
like some kind of a human
sacrifice to their will.
Look I think Zac'll be back
soon.
Do you wanna, I mean,
well if I could just carry on
cooking, you could have some,
you could stay,
- I wouldn't wanna...
- Yeah, I'm bloody starving.
...eat you out of
house and home...
No, well,
I mean you could eat
- Zac's portion as far as I'm
concerned. Right? That's fine.
- Yeah.
I don't know about you but
I just think if you put an egg
in something, it immediately
tastes nicer.
- I wouldn't know 'cause I
don't really cook, so...
- Or anchovy,
An anchovy... Just thinking does
Claire like anchovies?
Right.
You're speaking to yourself in
the third person, is that what
we would expect
from a prospective flatmate?
- No, no, no, I
ok, I've just never had an
anchovy, so,
- Are you being serious?
Yeah! No, I've never had one.
Right ok, we need
to change this.
I don't like
the look of them.
Oh God. Don't get them out.
Cause I think they're horrible.
Yeah, these are amazing.
It looks like the eyelids of old
men that that have died.
That's what I always think.
Tasty though.
Here you go...here's a tiny
smudge.
No, no, no, you're not
going to make me...
- Try it. Try a smidge...
- Why is it hairy?
It's just - These are...these
are luxury hairs, there are
hairs of luxury,
this is good living, right here.
- Oh my god...
- Tastes amazing,
It's acquired tastes. We will
sophisticate you if you live
here.
- Ugh.
- No?
- You've poisoned me.
- No..
- You've poisoned my unborn
child.
- No, no. These contain
omega 3, I think you'll find,
iron, calcium, probably,
vitamin D.
- Are you a doctor?
- I am doctor anchovy, and this
is the only thing I prescribe...
Next week I'll get you...
- Are you alright? You ok?
- I don't feel very well.
- Oh Christ, I'm sorry, Is it
the anchovy..?
- Is it alright if I sit down?
- Please yeah lie down, just
put your feet up.
I don't know what's wrong with
me, I just...
Can I get you a glass of water
or,
I'm just really, I'm just really
tired.
Of course you are.
You've been through shitloads.
On your own, I mean anyone would
be tired.
You're really kind, aren't you?
Do you want a,
a cushion or anything? ...
Oh my God...
- Did you see that?
- Yeah I saw the baby moving.
Aw that's nuts...
Give me your hand.
- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah.
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah that's amazing.
No one else has felt her, so..
Seriously?
Well I'm very privileged,
thank you very much.
She's saying,
"hey mum, I learnt how to do the
boogaloo,
self- taught."
 No I'm not, I'm saying
 fuck off. Can't you see
 he's just pretending?
I think she's actually telling
me to get on with it.
Stay there, stay there, don't do
a thing, I'm gonna go get you
some food, alright?
You just don't move a muscle.
It'll be the best thing you've
ever had, excluding anchovies...
(Key rattling in lock)
 He's coming....
 Do it. DO IT NOW!
(Groans)
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!
Fuck.
 That's it.
 Yes.
It was completely unnecessary to
kill that man, he was really
nice.
 He was a sop. A hipster sop.
Shh. The sacrifices I've had to
make.
 - What sacrifices?
- Children these days are
really spoiled.
Like, mummy I want a
playstation, mummy I want you
to kill that man.
 - I don't want a new...
- I know you don't want a new
daddy
but there was no possibility of
that so stop going on about it.
 - He saw everything.
- I know he's a witness but
there's a chance he might not
have told anyone.
 - His name was Josh.
No you're right.
No one called Josh is not gonna
tell the authorities.
He would have been like all the
 rest.
 - Inherently evil.
- Look stop going on about it,
I'm serious.
I'm the mother, I am in control.
 You regret it.
 You regret killing them.
I'm doing this because you're
making me.
 Oh no.
 No, please no.
 "Now, I want you to let
 a feeling wellbeing wash
 over you.
 A feeling of love for your
 fellow man.
 I want you to say to yourself,
 'I am Love.
 Everyone is kindness.
 Everyone loves me.
 Everyone loves my baby.'
 And I want you to imagine
 everyone you have ever met
standing around you in a circle
and placing their hands on your
 bump.
 Placing their Love upon your
 baby.
 This is The World.
 And they are saying,
'we are here to protect you..."
 Listen to the sound of my
voice.
 You feel better now.
I feel a lot better now.
Hey...
Excuse me, excuse me?
Hello?
Excuse me?
(Gasping)
Oh fuck.
 He knows.
He's onto us.
Can't believe it, he's fucking
onto us.
 He hath slipped from the net
 whom we chased.
 He hath 'scaped us
 who should be our prey.
 O'ermastered by slumber we
sank,
 And our quarry hath stolen
 away...
Zabek...
He was creepy.
Creepy little man.
 Slimy. Dumb. Like a lizard.
Dan...
what a dickhead.
He was a pig.
A total pig.
 He just didn't have
 the balls .
Ella
 Poor leadership skills!
- Cold- hearted bitch...
 - I agree.
Done her.
Very efficient with that one.
Zac...
didn't speak to him much but I
could tell he was a gobshite.
Total little twat. But it was
a shame about Josh.
Len...
 Len...
 Len...
(Knock at door)
Hi...
Hey...
I was wondering if I could
talk to you about Child Charity,
it's a local organization that
is working for children living
in poverty.
I already give to charity...
Do you? Which charities do you
give to?
I do sponsored runs.
- Oh wow, you must be really
fit.
- Yeah.
Oh I'm terrible,
I'm just like...
- yeah so do you have five
minutes?
- Not really.
Can I come in?
- No.
- Do you have a toilet?
You know I have a toilet.
Can I use it?
It's upstairs.
Thanks.
Looks like I'm gonna fall over.
Oh this is nice. Sports
equipment everywhere!
Sorry about that, I got a
bladder the size of a pea.
I need to piss every 11 houses
or something like that.
- What are you doing?
- I thought we could discuss
your donations.
I told you I already give to
charity.
Not to Child Charity though.
I couldn't give a fuck about
child charity, I just want you
out of my house.
Ok,
if you don't care about
children.
For what it's worth, you're
missing out on a really
worthwhile cause.
Yeah I'll try and live with
that.
So I saw all the climbing
pictures upstairs.
- So what?
- So I'm not leaving without what I came for.
Ah for fuck's sake,
let go, you crazy bitch.
 This is a farce.
 Are you fucking this up
 deliberately?
What are you doing?
Fucking hell.
I've called the police.
Shit.
Better get on with it then,
hadn't I?
Stop doing that.
No.
I'm gonna cut you.
Look I told you I already give
to loads of different charities.
What do you think this is, like
some kind of new initiative..
You never know with charities
these days,
you can't trust anyone.
Well that is true. I mean,
everyone's out for themselves.
You're insane.
I am a working mother.
It is not easy, meeting your
kids' demands these days.
Stop moving forward or I will
hurt you.
Tell me this like, why do people
pay for like sporting
activities,
- I mean I just don't get it.
- It makes you stronger.
Does it though? It's just like
following an instructor like a
bunch of sheep.
It's kind of weak- minded.
A lot of people searching for a
purpose,
I've already got one.
My baby...
Oh, Oh I'm really sorry.
Are you ok? I'm...
Do you know what really helps
with pain...
if you relax.
So if you sort of do some
breathing.
Yeah, that's it.
That's better right?
(Police siren)
Shit.
Shit!
(Knocking at door)
 Open up!
 Police! Open up!
(Banging on door)
(Banging continues)
Go away you're not helping.
 Open up!
(Police sirens wailing)
(Police sirens continue)
(Police sirens fade)
What happened to your eye, Ruth?
It's fine, I just knocked it.
Ok!
Perfectly healthy little baby in
there...
So, we're not out to get you.
What?
Well there's no
bad fairy trying to put a curse
on her.
No, I don't think so.
I would swap her
to have him back.
That's not an option.
I know but I wanted you to know
that.
Okay, she can't hear you.
That's not what the baby manual
says.
Well, but she can't understand
English.
She can, she's very articulate.
Ruth,
you missed your scan.
Don't wanna know what's in
there.
I'm scared of her. I mean, I'm
not even in control,
it's like I'm some crap
banged- out car
and she is driving, I'm just the
vehicle.
Honestly, it's like a hostile
takeover.
You missed your scan and that
was a very important scan, she
could come early.
No no no no no, no no no.
- No, I need more time.
- She comes when she wants to
come.
I've held back on telling social
services.
I've put my job on the line,
Ruth, for you.
I'm very sorry about your loss
and I know it's been very, very
difficult for you.
But you're going to be ok.
And the baby's gonna be ok.
I'm here to help you.
What's going on?
Whatever it is,
it's got to stop.
(Bell tolling)
I can't do it Matt ...
Don't make me do it.
I don't know what to do
 ... And reach over your head,
 stretch out that side.
 Keep your sitting bone on
 the floor to really
 create a stretch.
 Now inhale,
 Arms up.
 Exhale, hands to heart centre.
 Couple of breaths here.
Lovely.
Now for your favourite part.
Get down onto your backs for
Shavasana.
I'd like you all to scrunch up
your fists as tight as you can.
Take all the tension in your
body and put it into your fists.
Hold that for five counts.
5- 4-
3- 2- 1
Release.
Let your whole
body relax.
With that release, release
all your worries.
Any concerns of what's to come.
Relax.
It's very important to let the
past stay in the past.
You have to decide what's right
and what's wrong.
 I know what you did.
 You betrayed me
 to that bitch.
You understand?
 You can't shake me.
 I'm Fury.
 I'm in you.
 Look.
 Mummy
 Look!
(Screeching)
I succumb to your will.
Baby knows best.
 The instructor.
 He tells people what to do.
 But he won't control me.
 I'm not his puppet on a
 string like the others.
 Oh look, how funny, he's going
 to a Halloween party.
 Dress to distress.
 He won't need a costume
 he's already got blood on his
 hands.
 Get on with it.
I'm doing it.
I can't go any faster.
Ground please.
 What did I say would happen?
 If you don't do as I say.
 Blood will be shed.
 One way or another.
 Monsters.
 All of them.
 Monsters.
(Party chatter)
(Gagging)
No no no
that's not the deal.
I can't put her in the same
position...
 He was the only one who ever
 loved you.
 If you loved him,
 finish the job.
(Groans)
 It's an act of love.
 It's all you have isn't it.
 What else is there?
 No family no faith no friends.
 No future.
 Look at you.
 In love with the past.
 Kill him.
 Or I kill you.
Jess!
I thought I recognised you.
Oh yeah, from that climbing
center.
This is what I really look like.
From the inquest.
- I knew it was you.
- Oh the inquest.
I didn't know...
You didn't know about this.
Not many people know.
I kept it quiet.
Did he know?
You're having a baby, aren't
you?
Yeah, two months.
Yeah, you see,
your baby was born of pleasure,
my baby is born of pain.
I found out on the day he died.
That's terrible.
You're grieving.
I'm not grieving.
I'm gestating. Fucking rage.
Look,
I went through this,
over and over again.
- There was nothing else we
could do.
- We?
It was a group decision.
- You were in charge though.
- I had to think of everyone.
It was a matter of life or
death.
- It was unavoidable.
- It was easy.
- No.
- You made a selfish decision.
That suited all of you without a
thought for anyone else,
and you got away with it, scot
free.
Who cut the cord?
- I'm sorry.
- Who cut the fucking cord?
- I'm so sorry.
- It's not good enough.
Not good enough.
Please.
This isn't helping anyone.
I spoke to him before he died.
- What do you mean?
- I know that things weren't
great between you two.
- I know that he was thinking
about leaving you.
- No!
(Sobbing)
Let me help you.
Jess!
Let me help you.
 I'm about to take my last
 voyage.
 A great leap in the dark.
(Gurgling)
(Gurgling continues)
(Knock at door)
Good morning, mummy.
We managed to collect your
things for you.
She's just normal.
She's just a normal little baby.
Well of course she is. I told
you.
And you're just a normal mummy
too.
Look I know the cesarian
wasn't meant to happen
but when it's life or death we
have to make that cut.
I understand that now.
Just be grateful you've got a
happy, healthy little girl.
I know it wasn't in your birth
plan, Ruth.
I hadn't really
considered the birth in
terms of the plans.
OK.
Well we've got that far now,
haven't we?
It's all change.
All about what is best for baby.
I've done some really terrible
things.
I've done really bad things,
I've got it all wrong.
Look, we all get it wrong.
Always.
It's fine.
You see I thought I was
doing it all for her,
but I wasn't, I was doing it for
myself.
And I've only just realised
that.
'Cause she's not talking to me
anymore.
OK.
Well I'm gonna go and get your
health worker and bring her in,
and you can have a chat.
You can tell her how you're
feeling.
And you can chat all this
through with her.
How does that sound Ruth?
OK.
(Door opens)
(Door closes)
(Seagulls crying)
(Wind howling)
(Screeching)
(Baby giggling)
(Funky disco music)
