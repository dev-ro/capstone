So, Williams...
How does it look?
How's the star doing?
Are you done?
I'm going to do Leila's
at the Pussycat.
Okay. Have a good one.
How does it work?
They're lining up
to see that bitch dance.
It's all good.
Keep up the good work.
I can't stand the sight of her.
Nicky! Matty!
How are you?
How's it going, guys?
You in shape, kid?
I was looking at your doll...
You've got the jackpot there.
She knows how to heat up a club.
Hey, I don't want to die stupid...
tell me how she looked in bed?
Don't plug it in,
he's been unbearable
since they broke up.
There's plenty, isn't there?
What are you doing standing there?
Come down and sit
in the front row!
Mikey, we're here to work.
Work?
Work!
Sure thing! Let's have a drink.
Let's go to the office. Do you prefer
which poison? I've got a little...
Aren't you forgetting something?
I know, I know, I know.
I swear, it kills me.
About my mother,
I give you everything on Friday.
You're a month late.
I'd give anything
to be able to pay you tonight.
Give me a little time...
When you were in trouble,
I did present
your daughters, didn't I?
I've got you off the hook.
Those were the days,
but not anymore.
I helped you guys...
I ask
until Friday.
It's always Friday
with you.
I swear... on my knees.
I swear...
on my grandmother's grave.
Stand up.
Friday!
I knew I could count
count on you. Have a look!
Straight from Italy.
Latte di Suocera!
Milk that flows
from the breasts of your mothers-in-law.
75°. I unearthed it
especially for you, Matty.
Let's have a drink!
Isn't she wonderful,
our starLoretta?
Leila, what are you doing here?
I wanted to see
your last performance.
- You were great.
- I was?
You were really good.
Leila, I love you.
I love your breasts.
I'd kick his ass
all the way to the river.
She left
and found another.
- What can I get you?
- Another drink.
How about another drink?
Matt, you're kind of handsome.
You could get
a girl a night.
Why do you put yourself
like this?
Is it really worth it?
Yes, it's worth it!
Honey will be working at Mike's
Friday and Sunday, 9 a.m. to 1 a.m,
and from 3am to 7am on Wednesdays.
And put Bijou back in Latino
for the week.
- What's this rat poison?
- It's brandy.
- Where did you get this?
- Mike gave it to us.
That's right, it was sherry.
Why didn't you take off your thong
yesterday at the Cup?
How come
that you kept your thong on?
I had my period.
You went to a full-body nude
with your period?
No, not you, Mrs Johnson...
If you burn me at the Cup,
you'll be working a year for nothing.
Valid for everyone!
Then we'll be working
a year for nothing.
You want to work at Métropole
this weekend?
I'd love to.
- It's a good club, isn't it?
- Good tips.
I'm very grateful.
Thank you very much.
- And where's my fucking money?
- Sit down! Sit down!
You think that's all I have to do?
Shut up!
I don't have your fucking money,
but here's your salary.
It's all the same.
Don't be smart.
You remember,
you owe me 20 bucks.
Since when? Wait a minute, wait a minute!
I've got another one.
Call me back later, okay?
I'd like to speak
to Nicholas Piachenza.
It's himself.
This is the police.
- Where is she now?
- St Vincent's Hospital.
Good. Thank you.
Matt, Harry,
stay on the phone.
We've got Honey
after her performance yesterday.
And they knocked it out of the park.
Who?
I don't know anything about it.
She's at St Vincent's hospital.
I think it's time to go.
Hello, darling.
We brought you your favorite flowers.
Aren't they beautiful?
I'll put them here.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
Honey, if you need
anything,
Matty and I
are here for it.
How do you feel about it?
Do you want to talk about it?
Have you seen it?
He came up from behind.
He was like an animal.
He put a belt around me and started
hitting me on the head
and stab me.
I tried to run...
but he took my hands,
forced me to open my fists...
and started
cutting off my fingers!
I screamed...
I could see what he was doing...
And I shouted:
"Don't cut off my fingers!"
"Please,
not my fingers!"
How are you, Jimmy?
I'll pour you a drink.
Hi, honey.
Isn't that Matty over there?
Right this way.
Do you know everyone?
Coco, come here.
Jack Daniels, understand?
No ice.
Why isn't Nicky here?
Is he resting?
While the others work?
Holy cow!
We work hard and he rests!
What do you think of the sound system?
It's strong.
What is it?
- J.D... ? What the...
- J.V.C.!
Quadraphonic!
They're even in the crapper.
500 bags each.
Incredible, they love it...
They're crazy about it.
By the way, I almost forgot...
Friday night...
Go to the kitchen and get me
the envelope for Matty.
In the right-hand drawer,
it says Matty.
You can read, can't you?
What are you waiting for?
Didn't I say no ice?
- Here I am speaking Chinese!
- I'll drink it.
No, you drink it.
Honey, bring another one,
no ice!
You know it, though.
Get her ass out of the bar.
Wheeler...
How are you, Matt?
He's coming on Friday,
the best day.
You want to kill my business?
She better haul ass,
or I'll shut you down!
- You're not at La Mondaine anymore.
- You're looking for me!
Tell me something...
Are you in Homicide now?
You got anything you want to tell me
about that messed-up girl from yesterday?
I have so many girls...
I'm in.
Don't get smart with me, Rossi.
I'm not here
for handjobs.
A girl gets robbed, and...
I'm not talking to you.
Then who the hell are you talking to?
I'm not talking to you!
We didn't strip it.
We found $200 on her.
And that bothers me, Rossi,
especially when I think
the people she works for.
But I think a kingpin
like you must know things...
You're thinking wrong.
Well, think again.
If you value your job,
you'd better
to be cooperative.
Am I making myself clear?
Dagos like you
hang on by a thread.
Let's get out of this cesspool...
What a charming boy!
He couldn't find his cock
in his hand, and he's in Crime!
So much the better. At La Mondaine,
he spent his time
to close the clubs.
Just look at him!
He checks the license date!
What an asshole!
With these wops,
there's always a catch.
Do you think Rossi
know anything?
Yes. The whole thing
stinks of gang warfare.
Someone must be angry with him.
If I could
take them all to the hole!
Yes, but if ever
it's clean...
Nobody's clean!
Loretta...
Hello.
Can you lend me 10 bags?
Look in my wallet.
There's nothing in it.
You're broke.
Right, then. In the drawer, then.
Thank you for this. I'll return them tonight.
- What the hell are you doing?
- The last two at the Latino.
Your favorite club!
Last time,
a guy came on himself
before I took off my dress!
And they wonder what we have
against men!
What you have
against men!
- Haven't you had your fill?
- No, I haven't.
I'll be nice
and bring you a cup of coffee.
Would you rather it be
one of your dirty Italians?
Please, I can't do anything
before my coffee.
Guys seem kind of bland
when I'm around, don't they?
That's right.
That's what I like to hear
from my Loretta.
Do you love me?
I love this mouth.
I like your mouth.
I'll take care of the coffee...
Let's hear it for Loretta...
I've come to take you home.
I promised Leila
to pick her up at the Latino.
She'll do fine.
Have you decided to see me again?
Does noise still
from sleeping?
Have you stopped using powder?
Have you seen other people?
Does it help?
Don't you get it?
I'm afraid to sleep with you again.
I loved you too much.
You should have talked to me more.
Sometimes I just can't
to find the words.
Sometimes there isn't one.
Thanks, Matty.
"The reader must be warned
that all this really happened.
"The subway made her shiver.
Then the approach... and the blow!
"She screamed, wriggled
to escape the steel.
"Blood spurted onto the dock,
smelling of salt and plasma.
"It was 3:15 a.m.
at Herald Square station."
What can I say?
I'm glad she's alive.
Is this the same guy who attacked
our other dancer?
The same one?
I can't say for sure,
but it's possible.
The wounds all have
the same precision.
The killer seems to have some knowledge
knowledge of anatomy.
It always avoids arteries
and large vessels.
In both cases, it seems...
that he did everything he could to prevent death
was not immediate.
Thank you for your help, Doctor.
You know where to find me...
Hey, monkey!
Don't touch my car!
A funny way
to talk to friends!
What a joke!
I'm sick of dealing
with such a bastard.
Well, stop and do your job.
That's the second girl.
We're mad at you. You want to talk about it?
It's to protect your daughters,
asshole!
When do you start?
I hate nothing more
than macaroni in a Cadillac.
Get your shit over here.
Come on, hurry up!
She doesn't move from her dressing room.
What do I do
to work?
Okay, I'll talk to her.
They're going to ruin
the house in the air
if it doesn't come out.
I pay you
to supply me with girls.
If you're not happy,
pick them up at Goldstein's.
I'm all right,
but business is business.
I'm in deep shit.
Are you in trouble?
What about me?
I came to see...
if you needed anything.
Mike says you refused
to continue.
Give me time
to find a replacement.
No, I'll keep going, Matt.
- Matty... is she going to die?
- I don't know. I don't know.
She'll be fine.
Forget the money
Mike owed us,
I was forced
to slide over it.
- He's got reasons to gripe.
- Who doesn't?
This asshole must have already ordered
Goldstein some girls.
A good idea.
What, good idea?
We're his friends, Matt!
You're forgetting who endorsed it,
with all those sharks!
It was for work.
A poor job...
A really bad job!
Another cancellation...
These bitches are crazy.
They're scared.
Who's not afraid?
If this knife-wielding cocksucker
continues,
we're screwed.
What are you going to do?
What can we do?
This!
Blow his
his fucking brains out!
- Put it away.
- Damn it!
What, you got no backbone, Matty?
Do you have any?
You gonna put that
to a guy's head?
If you've got the balls
to do it... do it!
I don't want to see this anymore!
I'm sorry, but...
I didn't mean to...
Come on, forget it.
We've been buddies
for too long.
MAT ROSSI
AGAINST RIO-LE-KID
RIO IN A COMA
RIO IS DEAD
ROSSI ABANDONS THE RING
Carmine wants to know
whether to intervene.
Tell him no.
It's about Goldstein.
- Forget Goldstein.
- Forget it?
He has everything to gain
our girls are afraid to work.
You should think about it.
He needs to know that
his daughters are vulnerable too.
Carmine wants war
with Goldstein?
It's not that the sight of blood
scares you, does it, Matteo?
This way!
Why doesn't he stop
the fight?
The referee won't make you cut it.
Get up and kill him!
Take it down!
Good night, Mr. Goldstein.
I want to talk to you.
- Come in
- No, outside.
Hey, take it easy...
I want to know if you're involved.
I'm not a gangster.
I've heard things...
You've got the wrong enemy, Matt.
Look elsewhere.
It's already done.
Why do you think it's me?
You have a lot to gain.
Tell me something
that keeps me from shooting.
I'm telling you you've got the wrong
wrong man.
If you lied,
I'm dead.
Hurry up, you're late.
I'll pick you up
at 5 a.m. sharp.
Don't forget
to order the calamari.
Ruby, listen to me.
I don't want you to work anymore.
The boss's wife,
a fine example!
Do you know that I love you?
Come on, get out.
Lock yourself in.
Here's your coffee.
No cancellations?
Yes, two.
I replaced them.
Well done, Harry.
I want to speak to the director.
This is Carla Stark,
some news.
I would like to interview
interview you about
by Leila Powers
and Honey Washington.
When did they
started for you?
We need this!
- Who is it?
- The press!
What do they want?
I've got nothing to say to you!
ANOTHER DANCER
BALAFRÉE
Looks like she's doing better,
huh, Matty?
Yes, I think so.
Thank you for coming.
That's normal.
Let's go somewhere.
That's all we've got.
A white man.
He was using some kind of razor.
He seems to know
martial arts.
Apart from him,
it's a black hole.
I put every computer
in Washington on it.
I'll let you know
as soon as they've spotted it.
It doesn't look good.
If you were a hoodlum
and you wanted to kill someone,
how would you do it?
I'd shoot him.
Why?
It's fast, clean and radical.
Why don't they go after Rossi
Rossi directly?
Maybe they just want
just to scare her.
If he was the target,
he'd already be dead.
We started from the assumption
that it's a gang war.
But what if we...
the wrong way?
Do you realize what this means?
An entire city...
full of suspects!
I'm on my way.
It's been a long time
since we've been here.
I come here by myself
quite often, but...
it's not the same thing.
By the way, I almost forgot...
- What's your birthday?
- It's your birthday.
Go on, open it!
You spin it like this.
I LOVE YOU
You would never have given it to me
a year ago.
I was a fool, wasn't I?
Thank you.
You found the whisky!
Sorry, I don't have any bourbon.
Everything is as it was before.
I won't regret it,
will I, Matty?
No, you won't regret it.
As long as it's not
for the past.
Not at all.
It's for the present.
- What's the matter?
- It's nothing.
It's going to stop.
Another tragic night:
young dancer Silver Chavez
died as a result of the attack
the Butcher of New York.
Silver Chavez is the first
of his victims to die.
More details
from the university hospital.
I'm sending you two men.
Ask them what you want.
I don't need
anyone, Carmine.
I trust you, Matteo,
but this has got to stop.
It's a dirty business.
We're talking about it on the radio,
there's too much commotion.
I understand.
Accept men,
they could be useful to you.
20 years ago, I wouldn't have needed
needed to call you.
We would have taken care of that by now.
Yes, I know.
And remember
what you have to do.
He waited 24 hours
before calling!
It looked like an elephant!
And when Bobby
hit him with the brooch...
Shine on, Matty.
He went to impale himself
on the hook!
And he was screaming!
This is what inspires me
Carmine and his gang!
Loaded?
Let's go. Clear the way!
Come on, Leila, come on.
It's ruined.
Jorge, it's me, Loretta.
There, Loretta, I've served you well.
See you soon.
She's so ugly
it hurts my eyes.
She wouldn't even give
a rapist hard.
Loretta could have
at least called.
Why don't you
call the agency?
He has to do
something.
They sent me a monster
instead of Loretta.
This is me.
I have here the filthy sow
you sent me.
To attract the customer,
you can't show it from the front.
I'm not asking for a pin-up,
but still!
Send me one... a skinny one!
I'm going to kill that fat girl
and put her out of her misery.
Mike, I'll call you back, okay?
Can you believe it?
He hung up on me!
I'm screwed!
I'm ruined!
I'll never get out of this hole.
Loretta, wake up!
It's me, Ruby.
You missed your job,
and everyone got worried.
- What time is it?
- It's late!
I'll run you a bath.
"Chapter eight...
"With every criminal,
every whore,
"every useless life that dies,
"man advances
on the road to purity.
"The bones cracked...
"the muscles were tearing...
"Her eyes
begged for mercy.
"There is no mercy!"
- Do you mind if we take a picture?
- No, not right now.
- Any leads?
- No statement.
She worked for Goldstein,
not Rossi.
And now...
Our maniac
takes it out on others.
Firecrackers will be back
soon.
What are you talking about?
Gangs?
Come on, there's no such thing.
Keep your boys at home,
I don't want any trouble.
When your daughters were attacked,
you suspected me.
Now they're mine.
Don't you understand?
Here's my plan:
We organize a shuttle service
from club to club for our girls.
We hire detectives
to track this guy down.
Our offices remain open
just in case...
And club owners are forced to
to hire guys
for protection.
It won't be easy.
We'll help financially.
What do you mean by that?
I estimate the entire operation
at $2,500 per week.
For both sides!
We walk.
Well, let's go get
this fucker.
Nadja, be careful!
Tell your buddy I don't want
guns on the street.
Let him behave:
at the first sign of violence,
He and his Italian friends
are finished!
I'll give you 24 hours.
- What do you do for breakfast?
- I don't know yet.
How are you, Jimmy?
So, what's new?
Give me a double scotch
before I stay.
What a night!
Sugar, double bonus here.
- Has Matty been here?
- He came and went...
Where's Frank?
- Do you want me to ring it?
- What are you waiting for?
Pour me another.
I have to go to the bathroom.
And there you have it.
Nicky, how are you?
Any news?
- See that guy sitting in front of Bibi?
- That fat guy over there?
I've been seeing him for ages.
He's got a blade
in his pocket, a razor!
- What's up?
- Just a minute!
Call Bibi.
What's up?
See that guy sitting there?
- Don't turn around.
- What, what guy?
That fat man staring you in the face...
Ah yes, so what?
Suit yourself,
but lure him into the kitchens.
Do as he says.
Come on!
- How are you feeling?
- Not bad.
Hey, you, beat it!
Go clean up the sidewalk. Zou!
Where's the switch?
Turn it off!
- You've got a lucky star tonight...
- If you say so.
Come here, big boy.
Do you think
you're a man for me?
You'll see.
- Can you do it?
- And how!
What's going on?
It's your turn to talk.
- What's in your pocket?
- None of your business.
Don't touch me!
Assassin!
I've got it!
Nicky and Frankie light a guy
in the kitchen.
Matty, it's him!
I'll kill the son of a bitch!
It's not him!
It's not him, Matty, stop it!
Here's his ticket,
it arrived today.
This pig is an architect!
He's from Chicago.
Are you trying to tell me
that it's not him?
Look at my face!
And it's not him?
Throw that shit out.
No one is above the law.
Think about it, Sergeant.
We are the last protection
for honest people.
I called the agency,
Rossi isn't there.
We'll find it.
Matty, it's me.
I'm in the Village.
We just found Cindy
dead in front of the Pussycat.
Matty?
Matty, we won!
Why didn't you
stop the fight?
Hey, where are you going?
The show's not over yet!
A show?
What a rip-off!
I'll give you 50%
on your next ticket.
Just a second...
They're really hot...
I've seen better...
The guenons at the zoo
are more fuckable.
- I'll give you a discount...
- Shove it up your ass!
It's the fucking agency!
I'll call them.
Of course it's me.
- What's on your mind?
- I told you this would happen.
I have no one left!
Isn't Loretta here?
No Loretta,
or any of your chickens!
I'm losing everything.
You'll have a girl
in 30 minutes.
Bijou, it's Nicky.
Can you do
the second part at Mike's?
I no longer work
until we get this guy.
Hi, Bijou.
Delete them from the board.
Who, Bijou?
And Loretta with it.
You haven't given me
my check this week.
I wanted to tell you...
you don't have to pay me.
I know you're
in a bad way.
I appreciate that, Harry,
but you'll get paid.
Are you in trouble?
And I'm ruined!
I don't even have a glass anymore.
I serve them drinks
in cups!
Can you tell me what you're sweeping?
Go sweep over there.
What's it for?
There's nothing to wash.
I know what's bothering you,
and I'm sorry.
But don't take it personally.
We made a mistake.
I'll tell you what,
we're gonna get this motherfucker!
It's just a bad time.
You know what
Tommy Flingers said to me?
What the hell?
- Hands up!
- What's going on?
Shut your mouth! Get outta here!
- Listen, Zorro...
- Shut the fuck up!
Move your ass!
I saved myself the trouble
of fishing you out of the sewer, you wretch!
You're under arrest
for assault and battery.
A little assault and battery?
I warned you not to
in my way.
Cuff them,
and tell them their rights.
You can remain silent.
All will be retained by justice.
Shit!
Ruby, are you waiting for me?
You, come here!
Someone call
an ambulance.
Assault with a weapon
causing death.
So, you're a tough guy?
You fucked wops in the ring,
but you won't fuck the law!
Talk to my ass.
This little guy
needs a lesson.
Take off the handcuffs.
Lesson number one:
these handcuffs represent
the power of the law.
They remind
little shits like you
what honest people
are capable of
to curb anti-social
behavior. Get it?
Get it?
I think your mother
is being partouzée,
and she loves it!
Lesson number two:
a police officer
is the living embodiment of the law.
I will not accept
disrespect.
You're pissing me off!
Look at that door.
We are here
for a while.
One of your friends from the Italian Quarter
bailed you out.
Then you can go.
By the way, Rossi,
your partner's in hospital.
Let's hope the operation
will have stopped the internal bleeding.
The best thing to do
right now is to pray
and wait.
Follow me, please.
Here's the boss.
It's good to see you here.
I hope you're hungry.
Vito prepares
scarola and cannolini...
Would you prefer something else?
That is...
I'm not very hungry.
You're wrong.
Work should never be
interfere with love
or food.
You'll live longer.
Tell me, what's the big problem?
I want this guy so bad,
I can feel his blood in my mouth.
Don't let rage
by rage.
This man is serious.
I took it seriously.
I did everything I could to stop it.
Like being persuaded
by Goldstein to buy
your $2,500 security?
I'm surprised at you,
you've been fooled.
He didn't budge
when we had problems.
You didn't want to use
the men I sent you.
I thought you'd understand...
that this guy has to be caught,
not just prevented.
Terrorism cannot be prevented.
You have to look for your roots,
and destroy them.
An intelligent man
learns from his enemies.
He studies them, appreciates them...
But what did you learn from him?
You know nothing. You know nothing
about your opponent.
Study this man.
Respect him.
He's your enemy.
Can you do it?
Look at me!
And think before you answer!
Can you do it?
Yes, I am.
Great!
I've trusted you
for as long as I can remember.
Remember, this is a business
to be taken in hand.
Forgive me for the sin
I'm about to commit.
It's just not possible.
Even God cannot forgive
what has not yet been committed.
What are you referring to?
Nothing, Father.
You can hide it from me,
but not from the Lord.
Ask Him to guide you.
If that's all,
recite twenty-five "Our Fathers".
and twenty-five Hail Marys,
and repeat after me...
O my God,
forgive my trespasses...
Yes, it's me.
- Where are you?
- Close by.
I need your help.
That's right, I need you!
Can you tell me where you are?
I wanted to tell you
that I love you.
I love you, Matty!
Matty, I beg you!
Give me credit, just this once.
I've always paid...
I'll bring you the money tomorrow.
Bastard! Open the door! Open the door!
Fucking loser!
Don't ever call me a bastard again,
I don't like it!
Harry's been looking for you
like a madman.
What happened to you?
I'm in trouble.
I need some money.
Take 10 bags and go home.
I'll join you as soon as I'm done here.
But promise me
you'll go straight home.
