Thomas… Thomas!
Horror Hunters
He has contributed to the reorganization of the precincts …
… streamlined Homicide …
- I do not know what he's talking about.
… and he started Section Q…
…where the first results were almost miraculous.
And their only results.
They are known as the "Arab" and "drunkard".
Funny. Very funny.
Congratulations, Marcus. Good work.
- Speech!
- Shut up.
Where the hell were you?
The Bicycle Murder is not right.
Someone force-fed her pills.
- Carl, our new secretary is there.
- Okay. Then the Tornby case.
Frank hasn't been seen since the 21st,
but the phone was not used from the 19th.
Except for to a call to a market garden.
I want you to meet her. I like her.
We can not keep losing secretaries.
Look it's the Smurfs? Welcome.
Hello.
Rose?
Rose is our new secretary.
- Hey, Carl.
- Hello.
- Welcome.
- Thank you. This is gonna be good.
Assad and I already have a good chemistry.
Yes, we have.
Is he always the life of the party?
Don't worry about him.
Carl prefers his work to people.
Carl Mørck. That's you?
- I recognize you from the newspaper.
- Okay.
Did you not get my letter about Thomas and Marie?
- I do not know what you're talking about.
- Look at me. Tomorrow is Sunday.
Today is Thursday, so I don't think so.
Have you not looked at my case?
I'll do it when I get time.
Not today, okay?
Go home and sleep off the alcohol.
Hello? Wait.
Hey, Carl.
Your phone rings all the time.
I can't sleep.
- I thought you were with your Mom.
- I've been here for three days.
Carl here.
Did you know him?
- I have met him.
- Police Inspector in Næstved.
He retired in the 90s
after his two children were murdered.
- Did you say something about a package?
- In there.
TO CARL MØRCK SECTION Q
- What the hell is this?
- Is he yours?
It belonged to a retired police captain who died.
So you are all alone in the world now?
What is he called?
Cat.
Did you buy food, cat litter and toys for him?
- Of course.
- Good.
Come on, Cat.
Thomas and Marie Jørgensen. Twins.
Were stabbed to death. Marie was raped.
Here it says that the case was resolved.
Bjarne Thøgersen turned himself in and confessed.
- I don't understand?
- Henning Jørgensen, their Dad.
He continued the investigation
and was forced to retire.
Because he was crazy.
This is a madmans box.
How would you feel if it was your children?
Why this case, Carl?
We have 50 unsolved cases
that should have been cleared long ago.
Carl! Section Q is hanging by a thread.
We have become a fucking joke.
The father came to me yesterday after the party.
He wanted my help. I threw him out.
Two hours later
he commits suicide in his bathtub.
Maybe he was crazy
but I have to look at the case.
Okay?
Do we even know where to start?
Bjarne Thøgersen got five years.
Was released after three, for the double murder and rape.
What?
Claimed insanity and drugs.
His defense lawyer was Bent Krum.
- Krum?
- Never heard of him.
A lawyer who only works for
celebrities and rich people.
For 20 years he has represented millionaires …
Except in this case.
- Bjarne.
- Bjarne Thøgersen.
Let's go.
Goodbye.
20 YEARS EARLIER
I've had enough!
You're a pig and the whole room stinks of smoke.
Hello?
- Your pussy smells.
- What?
That's why guys avoid you.
Everyone says it stinks.
You're sick in the head!
Ditlev is a 10. Look at him.
Rich, hot and his final year. My prince.
Imagine being Ditlevs girlfriend.
- Where are we going?
- Far away from this shit hole.
Dybbøl, where the hell is Bjarne?
There he is.
- Hey, Bjarne.
What have we here then?
Bjarne …
Dybbøl.
- I havn't seen you before.
- He is Bjarne …
He lives in the real world, right?
- Should Kimmie get first puff?
- Give it here.
Leave my girl alone.
Bjarne Thøgersen.
We have some questions
about Marie and Thomas Jørgensen.
Have a nice trip back home.
Is Rikke home?
I would like to ask her about the rape.
Does this ever end? I was 16 years old.
I have served my sentence.
Really?
Three years for rape and double homicide?
I'm not the same person. I wasn't myself.
You said you hung out with Marie and Thomas.
You were high on mushrooms and cocaine.
Toxicological report shows
that Marie and Thomas drank beer.
But you sat opposite and took a lot of drugs,
and when they looked at you?
Do we have to do this again?
It's the same issues.
What the hell do you want me to say?
How did you get Bent Krum to be your attorney?
Your father was unemployed.
Your mother was a housewife.
Bent was not really in your class?
My parents took out an additional loan
they had until they died.
A Maserati 1968?
It's my hobby. I buy and restore them.
A used Maserati? They are very expensive.
- How can you afford it?
- Stocks.
Stocks? Do you have any good tips for me?
I don't care if you believe me or not.
I studied economics in prison
and when I came out there was a boom.
- I was lucky.
- Really?
Thank you.
It seems that everything he said is correct.
His parents took out a loan.
Bjarne was in stocks & equities.
So, he wasn't lying…
Where did he get his start-up capital from?
Bjarne was in prison.
His parents were in debt.
Two young, fit people against a guy
who was high on mushrooms.
I hear you, but we have 50 unsolved cases.
Tell me how Bjarne did it alone
so we can forget the case.
Here and now.
I …
I want a coffee now.
Two hours later, Thelma left.
Frank stayed on.
I wish there was better news, Ditlev.
I recognize him…
Frank Helmond, the mayor's PR guy.
Media bastard.
Thelma … So predictable.
Should I do something?
Thank you.
What do you want, Bjarne?
The police came.
They asked about what happened.
Glad you called.
- Hey.
- What are you doing?
I categorized the box.
Here are Marie and Thomas's murder.
Different abuse cases
and this is random stuff.
- Did I asked you to do this?
- No.
- So don't do it.
- Why not?
In the beginning
Henning only focused on the murders.
Then Bjarne got that crazy short sentence.
- So Henning starts looking at more cases.
- He thinks Bjarne has done it before.
Yes. He is fired from the police
and admitted to a mental hospital.
Then he fills in Sundays, zodiac signs
and full moons on this calendar.
What is this?
"Anonymous 911 call, Kirsten."
Henning says police received an anonymous tip…
…an hour after Marie and Thomas were killed.
7 km from the cottage.
- It does not say that in the report.
- Have you identified Kirsten?
I found this in the box.
Kirsten Marie Lassen,
Griffen Holm Boarding School.
- Find out who she is.
- She may be dead.
- Or married.
- What's the difference?
He's crazy about you.
- In the summer of '94?
- June 12th. Næstved precincts.
Expect nothing exact.
We keep most things like a museum.
- Tape?
- Do you want to borrow a tape player?
Who gave you that dress?
Rikke Hartmann gave it to me.
It is an Elise Gug.
It does not leave much to the imagination.
Don't you like it?
- Did you have fun Saturday night?
- Yes.
- And that was last Saturday?
- Yes.
- You and Rikke?
- Thank you.
It was fun to see her.
She has lost weight.
Beautiful, Thelma.
- Dybbøl here. Hey, Pram.
- Thelma is cheating.
- Oh. I know who it is.
Meet me in half an hour
Are you serious?
- Jørgensen has committed suicide.
- Shit.
Bjarne rang.
The police are snooping around.
Why is that?
I don't know.
Bjarne is paranoid.
No lights.
Is that him?
Now.
Get up!
- Hello there.
- Hey.
- How is everything?
- Good. What is that?
An old tape recorder.
- It's been a while since we talked.
- Yes.
- Should we have dinner tomorrow?
- Okay.
- I'm back at 7:30.
- I'm buying dinner.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- It was the black bastards.
- We will send a car. Stay calm.
Calm? They have smashed the place up!
- How old is she?
- 64, and she's in bad shape.
- Are you coming?
- The ambulance is coming soon.
Hey, it's the police?
It was the waiter who did it.
911. Is anyone there?
They were unhappy little angels.
Black fragments from the oily sky
dripped into their eyes.
- Who is this?
- Kir…
- Calm down.
- We … They're both dead.
What is your name and where are you?
They are both dead.
What is your name and where are you?
Help me, please.
His kisses tear me in half and destroy my dream.
- Is anyone there?
- They were unhappy little angels.
Black fragments from the oily sky
dripped into their eyes.
- Who is this?
- Kir …
- Kirsten?
- Calm down.
We … They're both dead.
We what? We killed them?
- What is your name and where are you?
- Help me, please.
What happened in that cottage?
We tried to find Kirsten Lassen
but she's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?
- Away.
She has no registered address.
No name change, nothing.
Her only relative, a stepmother,
hasn't seen Kirsten in 20 years.
A step-mother?
Yet another missing person, Carl.
- They're both dead.
- What is your name and where are you?
Help me, please.
Want to play with the kids?
But you have to eat.
Eat something, dear. You do not eat enough.
You do not eat enough.
Hey, Kimmie.
One of my tricks gave me a bonus
if he got to beat me.
Then he puts a plastic bag over his head
while I jerk him off.
Do not remove the plastic bag next time.
Hello. Can I help you?
Don't touch me.
Why do you ask me?
I have not seen her in 20 years.
- You are her only family.
- I was married. Not blood relatives.
Kirsten was extreme.
She went around half naked when we had guests only…
…for a reaction. She played hooky and stole our liquor.
Did you send her to boarding school
after her dad died?
- You say it like it's a bad thing?
- When did you see her last?
The week she came back from boarding school
Kirsten moved back into her Dads old room.
One night she came home and had a party.
It was really messy in her room.
- After that, she was gone.
- And she never came back?
Why didn't you call the police?
She had emptied our bank account
- And I thought she'd run off to the US or India.
- Do you know this man?
- No.
- Have you ever seen him before?
- No.
- Friends? Boyfriends?
- She never told me anything.
I heard about the Physics teacher
but only when the school called me.
- Physics Teacher?
- The one who raped her.
Thank you.
- Klaus?
- Yes.
- What's it about?
- Kirsten Marie Lassen.
- Hey.
- Can I come in?
I went for a walk
and the rain took me by surprise.
Kirsten? Why are not you in your room?
My roommate has a visit from her boyfriend.
They'll finish in 20 minutes.
Can I borrow a towel?
I can drive you home.
It only takes three minutes.
All the girls in school are in love with you,
you know.
This is not a good idea.
I won't tell anyone.
Fuck me! Fuck me!
Leave me alone! Help!
- Klavs, what's happening?
- Stop, please!
- She accused you of rape?
- Yes. I was cross-examined.
Then I was accused of yet another rape.
Some rape in Fensmark Forest.
How did you avoid prosecution?
- I did as they said.
- Like who said?
The school, of course.
Half of Denmark's business leaders
went to Griffen Holm.
They could not afford more scandals.
Kirsten dropped the charges…
…they accepted my resignation and I kept quiet.
It ended there.
If you speak the truth, why did she do it?
I have asked myself over and over again.
I don't understand this case.
He talked about another rape in Fensmark Forest.
- Henning mentioned it in his papers.
- In his box of madness?
A toast to our host!
Ulrik, old friend.
Thank you for letting us use your wonderful home again…
…despite our bad luck with the weather.
Cheers for Ulrik.
We have the usual hunt
but this year we have a special hunting.
This year's prize is a cottage in Provence.
Be on your guard, gentlemen. Ulrik.
Let the hunt begin!
- Ditlev, Ulrik, we need to talk.
- Now?
Okay, us three will go together.
Section Q?
Apparently they have asked
the fraud division to investigate Bjarnes finances.
Can they do that without prosecuting him?
I can't do anything to stop it.
As Bjarne's former defense attorney,
I am too involved.
What's going on, Bent?
What is it?
Let me clarify that you did not
hear this from me.
They are looking for Kirsten Lassen.
It's best that I do not hear from you again.
There could be many reasons
why they are looking for her.
- Shit.
- She may be dead.
- I'll put Alberg on it.
- Ditlev …
We must bury this, once and for all.
It is not our fault. They're just stupid.
Are you cold?
We can make hot chocolate when we get home.
What are you doing?
Don't be afraid.
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.
Everything will be all right.
Leave us alone.
Leave us alone.
Leave us alone.
Rape, Fensmark Forest. May 15, 1994.
They pulled a hood over her head.
She lost all track of time.
She saw nothing.
She heard at least two people who giggled.
One of them was a girl.
She fainted.
She woke up an hour later.
Nude.
All her clothes were gone.
May I see.
Carl?
Sunday. Well done, Henning.
What do you know about boarding schools?
That's where you send the kids
when you want to get rid of them.
They live here,
go to school six days a week…
…and their only day off is Sunday.
Thomas and Marie were killed on Sunday.
The girl in the woods?
Also a Sunday.
Back to the box of madness.
Sunday, October 24th.
A man is beaten nearly to death. 1993.
- Who made the coffee?
- Rose.
Perfect.
Sunday, November 6. Assault.
The perpetrators wore hoods.
Did you go to Griffen Holm boarding school
from 1993 till 1996?
Do you remember a girl
named Kirsten Marie Lassen?
Sunday again. May 15
The girl in the woods attacked.
What a bunch of crap cases.
Kirsten was sweetheart with Ditlev Pram.
- The Ditlev Pram?
- Yes, he left final year. Good Chap.
- Who is it?
- A sexy magnate.
He owns the largest hotel chain in Scandinavia.
Private hospitals, pharmacies …
Not a guy you just call.
- Anything else?
- She was a loner who played truant.
No one knew her
but everyone has mentioned Pram and Ulrik Dybbøl.
- Bjarne then?
- No, but I'm not finished.
People have just stopped working.
Stay until you have talked with everyone.
Good work, Rose.
- Call her whole class.
- Bite me.
I'll take that as a yes.
Assad. Here he is.
DITLEV PRAM OPENS HOTEL CHAIN ​​IN NORWAY
Some employees work part time
at my private hospitals.
I heard a rumor…
…you're spreading lies
about who you think did this to you.
It's a mess, Frank.
Congratulations.
My PR firm just hired you as a consultant.
You do not have to lift a finger.
Sign the contract…
…then you get a nice, big amount
in your account every year…
…for the next six years.
You can focus on the good in life.
And never think about me …
…or Thelma again.
Here let me adjust that!
Do we agree?
Say Cheese Frank.
Honey, the police are here.
All right. I will come.
- Carl Mørck.
- Ditlev Pram.
- Assad.
- Ditlev Pram.
We want to ask about your classmates
at Griffen Holm.
Exciting. Can I offer you something?
- No, thank you.
- Coffee, please.
Sit down.
- Did you sleep? Are you feeling better?
- Yes.
And a snack.
- Have you ever heard of the phone?
- Sure.
- Shoot.
- Did you know Kirsten Marie Lassen?
Kimmie? Sure. Her you do not forget.
- Kimmie?
- Kimmie.
- Were you sweethearts?
- Yes, a few months.
What was she like?
Completely crazy.
Yes, that about sums it up.
- In what way?
- Kimmie was wild.
She got really drunk, passed out,
was extremely jealous…
…then she became violent, and I had enough.
- Have you seen her since?
- No.
- Are you all right, darling?
- Yes.
I can help her with the coffee.
She'll appreciate your help.
Bjarne Thøgersen?
Sound familiar?
Everyone talked about Bjarne that summer.
- Did you know him?
- We shared a joint sometimes.
It's scary, considering what happened.
- Hey.
- Shit! Sorry.
- Are you OK?
- I'm just a little tired.
What can I do for you?
I just came to say … Milk.
- I don't take milk.
- Okay.
I dropped an entire aquarium once.
It was not funny.
- I'm serious.
- Sure …
You don't seem like the aquarium type.
Why not? I like fish.
- But not milk.
- No. Not milk.
I hope I have been helpful.
Please contact the office if you need me again.
- Wow.
- It was a good day.
- Is that Bent Krum?
- He is my family's lawyer.
- Do you know him?
- I know of him.
And also there is Ulrik Dybbøl
another student at Griffen Holm.
Exactly.
You have done your homework.
- That's what you pay us for.
- And we do that gladly.
Ditlev and Bent Krum.
You said he was the wealthy lawyer.
But still.
Ditlevs wife was scared.
Hey, Rose. Really?
- What?
- I'll put it on speakerphone.
- Need help?
- No.
Come on.
Not the …
Next.
Carl. Let me show you.
It doesn't work.
How long ago?
- Thank you.
- What did she say?
An old classmate saw Kimmie recently.
- Where?
- At the central station.
She is alive.
Tell me who to talk to.
THANKS FOR DINNER
- JESPER
PR MANAGER ATTACKED BY IMMIGRANTS
We are not the only ones looking for Kimmie.
A guy with a tattoo
has been asking for her in the last few days.
- She has a prostitute friend. Tina.
- I'll take care of her.
The day after we find out that Kimmie is alive…
…others also start to look for her.
What's going on, Carl?
- Either it's a coincidence …
- Or someone is watching us.
You.
I missed you.
I have.
But now I'm at home.
Now I'm home.
I told him you would leave us alone.
- Kimmie?
- I need somewhere to sleep.
Tina, where have you been
where did all this drug come from?
Where did you get it from?
Who have you been talking to?
I was just trying to help you, Kimmie.
Tina, do you remember his name?
Do you remember who he works for?
He said you were old friends.
That is all.
He was so damn nice.
I froze, Kimmie.
No name?
I froze.
It's my Dad's.
Here.
It's loaded.
Everything in that circle is yours.
You decide if it lives…
…or dies.
My princess.
I love you.
- Fuck, it's a prefect.
- Who cares?
I do! I can be expelled from school.
Do you think my Dad knows that I took his rifle?
We thought you could use some pocket money.
I don't want your money.
Honest I don't, I might get expelled.
Why you were playing with weapons
on school grounds?
- Idiots.
- What did you call us?
You little shit!
Come on!
Do not do it … No!
Are you looking at my girl?
Do you think she's hot?
You gossip, you're dead.
- Are you sure it's here?
- Yes …
Dammit! Press them all.
Carl!
Freeze! Freeze!
Turn around.
Turn around. Stay there.
Hands up. Show your hands.
Show your hands! Drop the pipe!
Drop it!
Okay …
Okay, okay.
I will not hurt you. I won't.
I am here to help you.
Put it down.
Kimmie.
- Who sent you?
- I'm with the police.
Liar!
You tried to kill me.
- You tried …
- Thomas and Marie …
You tried to call to tell us what had happened.
Leave me alone, everybody.
- They will kill her.
- Who will kill who?
Kimmie Lassen was witness
to a double homicide in 1994.
- She wasn't just a witness.
- She tried to clear herself.
She tried to kill you.
- She has been on the run for 20 years.
- So what?
- You understand nothing.
- Do you have any evidence at all?
In addition to a homeless
and a prostitute who took an overdose?
So good. No suspect either, I guess?
Possibly students
from Griffen Holm boarding school.
Ditlev Pram and a guy named Ulrik.
Ditlev Pram? Have you gone mad?
Ditlev and Kimmie were together.
- It's all we know now.
- Disgusting!
Call Rose and find out …
Turn that off. Call all the hospitals.
- Marcus!
- Carl …
We need to … Kimmie …
Carl!
- I told you what she was capable of.
- When I find her…
Don't be an idiot.
Lay low for now
and erase all traces of our work.
- What the hell, Ditlev.
- We have not seen each other and will not again.
- What if they find her?
- She has dug herself into a hole.
Finally she disappeared altogether.
- What if they find her?
- Then we do it.
I have had 20 years to prepare.
Okay?
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I have never met anyone as destructive as him.
I don't think I can handle this.
Rose …
We need you.
I need you. Okay?
How do you stand him?
I'm the only one he has.
- What is this?
- An old hospital record. June '94.
What the …?
What is it?
I have received two fails.
I think I have failed physics.
It's that fucking teacher
- Klavs Skovgård.
I know how we can get rid of him.
If he has sex with a student …
…against her will …
But I can not.
What do you want me to do?
Just do what you do with me.
You are a fucking genius.
My Princess.
Good morning.
- You snore.
- Did we find her?
Carl, calm.
The doctor has just gone …
Did we find Kimmie?
No, and we're still looking for the guy
with the tattoo.
The fetus then?
Gentofte's Hospital, 16th June, 1994.
A young girl came running
into the emergency room all bloody.
She had been beaten and raped.
She did not give her name
or say who beat her.
The doctors notes say that she was four months pregnant
but the baby died.
When they took the baby out
she escaped from there.
They never managed to identify her.
June 16?
Four days after the murder of Marie and Thomas.
- We need to find her.
- Carl, there's one more thing.
I asked for more men to search for Kimmie
but was refused.
- Damn, Marcus.
- I do not think it's Marcus.
I have a traffic campaign.
Against drunk driving…
…speeding, bike lights. I have no cars.
- Traffic Campaign!
- You know how it is.
- You wanted to see me?
- No, we wanted him.
- Griffen Holm, graduating class '81.
- Look.
- The chief of police.
- He went to the same school as Ditlev Pram.
Yes, but ten years earlier.
Are you implying
that he is involved in a murder case?
No, but he and Pram
are sitting on the same board…
…and he hunts with Dybbøl.
They have the same tie pin.
Pupils from the school are closing ranks
and being of service to each other.
So now tell us that the police chief's decision
not to give me help…
…has something to do with a traffic campaign?
All right.
And he has asked you to monitor my department?
Which cases we work with
who we're looking for?
Yes, he wanted to see your files.
I knew nothing about this.
And now there is someone out there
trying to assassinate our only witness.
- If I …
- You get five cars with two men each.
Traffic campaign was just canceled.
- Thank you, Marcus.
- Just find her.
We'll check the north side again.
We were just there, Carl.
Carl, I'm driving home now.
- What are you talking about?
- What is it with you?
She does not deserve this.
She is an accomplice to a double homicide.
She is just as guilty, she said so.
- She tried to kill you.
- Kimmie tried to tell the truth.
She has lost everything. Her children, her family.
She has nothing to live for.
She does not deserve this.
I'm driving you home now.
What the hell!
- I know what I'm doing.
- Calling 16-11.
16-11.
The suspect was seen at Øbro bathhouse.
- Have you found her?
- No. But someone saw her there.
A Dark Brazil, please.
Do you mind if I bathe first?
Do you like to play the clean lady?
I think I probably won't once we get started.
All right.
Do you think I don't know who you are?
You're finished.
You killed Tina.
Climb over … Climb over.
Climb over.
- Do you work for Ditlev or Ulrik?
- Ditlev.
Let go.
Let go!
Let go.
- Carl. I called you when …
- Who is it?
Tim Alberg. Former soldier. A year in Iraq.
Has his own business. TA Security.
He was pushed.
A witness heard a woman's voice on the stairs.
Come on. You need to see this.
Frank Helmond was attacked by immigrants.
- It looks like …
- Thelma.
There is our link between Ditlev and Alberg.
- Have we got his mobile phone?
- No.
- Kimmie.
- Track the mobile.
Let me see it again.
Yes?
All right.
It's moving north of Copenhagen.
What is it?
Fuck. We lost the signal.
- She is on the motorway to Hellerup.
- Or Vedbæk.
Ditlev.
Do it …
Do it!
Put the gun down!
Kimmie.
Kimmie, it's okay.
It's okay.
He can not hurt you.
You never stop?
You do not care if it's right or wrong.
What are you talking about?
We have her, Ditlev.
She will tell us everything.
And you can not do anything.
You smile, but you know I'm right.
That's it, Carl.
- You are finished. It's over!
- Enough!
Pack a large bag!
What is happening?
"I want to taste your blood.
Your bloods taste drowns my soul."
"You torn apart. You screaming."
What is this?
Letters Kimmie wrote to Ditlev.
Bent Krum gave us them just now.
How bad is it?
She wants to stick a screwdriver in his eye.
It's fucking bad.
- And we are confident …
- Yes, that it's her handwriting.
I have met with the prosecutor.
Whatever Kirsten says…
…no judge will accept the case against Pram and Dybbøl…
…based on her testimony.
Not after those letters.
- We have Alberg.
- It's not illegal to work with Pram.
They found hair on the carpet and fingerprints…
…that puts Kirsten in Albergs apartment
at the time of his murder.
The only case we have right now
is a murder case against Kirsten.
What will happen to her?
Witness reports and Krums yelling about his client's rights…
…means she will be placed in psychiatric care.
I don't blame you
because you don't trust anyone.
I do not trust anyone.
In my job we see all the lying and stealing…
…and the secrets.
You see people smile…
…playing with their children,
buying a house and one would think …
…that it might be so…
…one day..
Maybe it could be that one day.
Some days I decide between getting up…
…or taking a jar of pills to end it all.
You know why I don't?
Because of you.
People like you need me.
The only thing that matters
is that you get your life back.
So that you don't need to run anymore.
Your daughter…
Was Ditlev the Father?
I promise I'll get you out of here.
But you must help me.
I know what Ditlev and Ulrik did…
…but I can't prove it.
Ulrik …
He collects things.
Jewelry, clothing, hair.
- From his victims?
- Yes.
He sleeps with it.
All right.
You must meet with the judge tomorrow morning.
I'll drive you there.
Do you promise?
Yeah.
- We must enter Ulrik's house.
- We're the fucking cops.
We can not break in based on a hunch.
I'll get a search warrant afterwards.
- Don't go too far, Carl.
- Did I ask you for help?
I do not need you.
What is your plan?
You don't have a plan.
- Who are you calling?
- I'm doing this for your sake.
If Ditlev knew I was here …
If this works out, Thelma,
you'll never see him again.
Ulrik is a loner.
He only leaves home to go to work.
- But he has a weakness.
- What is it?
Me.
- Dybbøl here.
- It's me.
- Thelma. Is something wrong?
- I need you, Ulrik.
- Where should we meet?
- Same as last time?
I'll be there in an hour.
The woman who broke into the family Pram…
…36-year-old Kirsten Marie Lassen …
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting Rikke. I have to go out.
If I call Rikke
and ask if you are on the way …
Do it then, Ditlev.
Good, Carl.
- I'm glad you came.
- Of course.
What can I offer you? White wine? Champagne?
Something stronger, perhaps?
I missed you.
Same here.
I feel so detached from him.
It's over between us.
It is six months since we …
Yeah …
- Dybbøl here.
 Effurdurm Security, one of your sensors were activated.
- Where?
- East side. Should we send a car?
No. It is only a tenant.
I'll take care of it.
- How many fucking rooms does he have?
- Did you look here?
- No.
- There must be a bedroom.
- Take it easy.
- Quite Now!
- Do you speak French?
- Yes.
Nihla, is Ulrik sleeping in here with you?
He comes every night
but it is not his bedroom.
Is there a locked room that only Ulrik uses?
- Upstairs.
- Yes. Thank you.
Hell.
They are in the house.
- Maybe it's a false alarm.
- No, this is bad.
Milo, where are you?
Assad.
Shit!
Hurry!
This way!
Carl!
- Why didn't you say something?
- I wanted to be absolutely sure.
- So you're OK?
- Yes.
You can't see it, but I am four months gone.
- Do you want to touch it?
- No.
What is it?
That hottie Marie is alone at home
with her brother tonight.
Coming?
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!
Can I go first?
Hold her down!
- Dybbøl.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck!
- 911, who is it?
- Kir …
- Is anyone there?
- We … They're both dead.
What is your name and where are you?
Help me, please.
- What are you doing?
- I never want to see you again!
- What is going on?
- I'm fine.
I have to go now. Or I will be late.
No!
My baby …
Is my baby okay?
You'll see the judge in about an hour.
Against the wall.
- Where is Carl Mørck?
- He did not come.
Stand up. Face to the wall.
There is a bridge half an hour away.
But if it goes wrong …
- It won't.
- No.
His case goes wrong. He gets drunk…
…they drive off the bridge, he and his partner drown.
We will not stop until you drink it all.
Open your mouth.
Open your mouth.
Good boy.
Kimmie…
Don't do it.
Kimmie, listen to me. Do not do it.
- We have to get out of here!
- Milo.
Milo!
Kimmie, put down the gun. Put it down now!
Are you okay?
- Cover me.
- No, Carl!
Carl, what now?
Kimmie!
Pram!
Kimmie …
It's me.
- Kimmie.
- Stop!
Help me … help me.
Help me.
Kimmie …
Don't do this.
It's over now.
We have them, okay?
Can you hear me?
You did it, okay?
You have to put the gun down.
Come on.
Do you remember what we talked about?
It's not too late to get away.
Good.
I love you.
My Princess.
No … No!
No.
No!
Carl! Enough is enough!
Enough is enough.
A 20-year old murder case is finally resolved.
Two senior managers died
during the investigation.
They had a history of violence
together with Bjarne Thøgersen.
The lawyer Bent Krum is involved…
…in regards with Ditlev Pram and Ulrik Dybbøl.
Krums relation to the two are under investigation…
…to see if he knew Pram and Dybbøl were guilty of murder.
It is not clear how many crimes …
