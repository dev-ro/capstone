It's Deshannah.
Do you know where
they were going?

they were here

Well, did you see them together

This is, uh... this is Tony.
I'm Katherine's father.

Walked away,

right here, okay? Gonna just...
She's not complaining of any
pain, but she's disoriented,
which can happen
with head trauma.
We're just gonna
take a look over here.
DR. JAFFREE: Okay, very good.
Thank you, Joe.
Now we have to do one last
portion of the exam.
It's a little bit uncomfortable.
These here,
these are called stirrups.
And, Dad, if you're okay, this
is the more sensitive part.
Just gonna change my gloves.
Hey, babe, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna see you
in a few minutes, okay?
If at any point
you feel discomfort,
please let me know.
You're gonna feel
a little bit of cold jelly
and lots of pressure,
but no pain, okay?
Just a little bit
of pressure, okay?
I'm just gonna be
taking a few samples.
DR. JAFFREE:
I'm looking to see
if your hymenal ring
is still intact.
Sometimes when people are
touched inappropriately,
those things can be damaged.
-DR. TAJ: We are all done.
-DR. JAFFREE: Here you go.
Yeah, you got it. Good girl.

they got lost on the way back,

30 miles down the road

Tonight, you're going to die!
-You're all going to die.
-TONY: Do something!
Demon, your voice
must be silent.
See you in hell.
Submit to God, resist the devil,
and he will flee from you.
I command you to obey me
to the letter.
I, who am a minister of God.
You're the whore of God.
ANGELA (demonic voice):
Killer of your own child,
who cries out for mercy in hell.
No.
-Whore!
-No!
-You are the whore of God.
-No.
You were to honor your mother
with a child in her name.
(crying)
Did the power of Christ
compel you?
(demonic cackling)
MIRANDA:
We need to try something else.
Something different.
Something new.
(demonic laughter)
"All things are passing away.
God never changes."
"He is my fortress
and my refuge."
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come...
-Thy kingdom come.

Let's see what root work can do.
DR. BEEHIBE:
Put the bowls at their side.
This is our end
and our beginning.
"It is you who will trample
our affliction,
healing in atonement
for our sisters."
DR. BEEHIBE:
It was the hyssop branch
that was raised
to quench the lips
of the lamb on the cross.
What are you doing?
DR. BEEHIBE:
Vinegar offered in jest
-that became our salvation.
-(demonic groaning)
-She knows what she's doing.
-REVANS: What is she doing?
I mean, what-what is that?
"I will sprinkle clean water
on you,
and you will be clean.
I will..."
"And I will cleanse you
from all impurities
and from all idols." Ezekiel.

the flesh of the lamb,
it was water and blood
that poured to the earth.

VICTOR: Our Father,
which art in heaven...
...hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...
(voice shaking):
You never wanted me.
You made your choice
when my mother was dying!
DOCTOR:
Your wife has serious injuries.
Anything we do to keep her alive
will endanger your child,
and we cannot save them both.
Save my wife.
(Victor's voice):
Then save my wife.
DR. BEEHIBE:
Don't listen to it, Victor.
Don't, Victor.
(demonic voice):
Let them kill the child.
You wanted Mother.
Victor.
God played a trick on you.
(normal voice):
The baby lived instead.
What?
The one you never wanted.
So we ripped her from the belly
of your dying bride!
(demonic voice): Now you
have to make another choice.

One girl lives.
One girl dies.
REVANS:
Deceiver!
Do not offer that which is
already belongs to God.

you should have made then.
Choose me!
No, Mother, choose me.

Protect her.
Choose me.
Choose me.

your forked tongue of lies.

-Choose me.
-Choose me.

KATHERINE (demonic voice):

You must choose,
or both girls die.
I won't choose.
We can't choose.
ANGELA (normal voice):
Choose me.

the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.
Amen.

defend us in our battle against
principalities and powers,
-against the rulers...
-ANN: Thank you, Father.
...of this world of darkness,
against the spirits of
wickedness in the high places.
-(demonic wheezing)
-Come to the assistance of men
whom God has created
in his likeness
and whom he has redeemed
at a great price
from the tyranny of the devil.
(demonic wheezing continues)
I charge you, Satan.
I charge you, Satan,
enemy of human salvation,
acknowledge the justice
and goodness of God the Father,
who, by his righteous judgment,
has damned your pride
and your envy.
Depart from
these servants of God
whom the Lord has made
in his own image,
who are adorned with his gifts
and adopted as daughters
of his mercy.
I charge you, Satan,
prince of this world,
acknowledge the power and
the strength of Jesus Christ,
who defeated you in the desert,
overcame you in the garden,
despoiled you on the cross,
-and in rising from the tomb...
-(wailing)
...transferred your spoils
into the kingdom of light.
-Depart through this sign
of the holy cross... -Depart.
...of our Lord Jesus Christ...
Depart.

The lion of the tribe of Judah,
the offspring of David,
