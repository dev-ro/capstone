.... To Her
An independent film by
Zeki Demirkubuz
I'm Yusuf Günes,
born in 1965 in Erzincan.
I've been in prison
for ten years.
And there're only three days
to my release. .
I lost my whole family at the earthquake.
I have no one left in life.
There is nowhere I can go,
no job, no profession.
So, I beg you to help me spend the rest of
my life here in prison.
Otherwise
I'll have to commit a crime. .
...in order to extend my sentence.
I believe that
you understand me.
I kindly inform you of my situation.
Your photo... .
Are you threatened
by your enemies?
I have no enemy.
Then?
I just fear.
A long time passed.
Don't you have any relatives?
Only my sister and
her husband.
I heard they moved
to another town.
Have you no contact?
Sister's sometimes sends
me some money.
You say there is no way?
I had a friend in Prison.
Orhan who is from Istanbul.
His father ran
a coffee house there.
He wanted me to go and
work with him.
Do you have an address?
Yes. But Orhan was exiled
to another prison
and I lost contact with him.
so many years passed.
If we don't let you stay here,
will you commit a crime?
what kind of crime will it be?
Have you decided?
After I read your petition,
I looked your file.
You seem a quite person.
There is no disciplinary punishment.
You're said to be
an introvert by the guards.
It's apparent that
you are a good person.
Plus, very young.
Your fear is normal.
But your wish to stay here
along your life is nonsense.
If there is a danger, tell us
and we'll help you.
But this 's unacceptable.
Even the president can't do this.
If you insist to crime,
it's your decision.
Then you'll lose your rights.
You get eight more years
plus the punishment of new crime.
it may be too late
to change your mind.
Trust and listen to me
as your senior and don't do it.
It makes unhappy
you and us.
Don't panic. You know nothing.
Go and try! If you fail,
do as you know. Am I not right?
Don't hesitate.
If I'm being unfair, say so!
I N NOCENCE
Hey you! Get up!
What's the matter?
You'll tell it
at the police station.
Come on! Get down.
Hurry up!
They have any baggage?
No sir.
OK. Move on then.
Welcome, what happened?
They talked behind me again.
Who are they?
Everybody. I can't resist anymore
I'll shot up them.
Don't say anything.
It can incite them.
My life is hard enough for me.
Have a seat, I'm just coming.
Did you come honey?
I sold the ring.
Welcome.
There was a broken bed.
I had to fix it.
What the hell did he do on it!
This child's sick. She has fever.
Her parents 'll be here in soon.
They're always late.
A doctor has to see her.
She's wet with perspiration.
Your identity card.
Where do you come from?
Adana
The place of destination?
Istanbul
How long will you stay
I don't know?
OK. Anyway,
we have some free rooms.
Prize's for one person,
If you prefer to share; 2 75
There is a quiet boy,
you can stay with him.
That will do.
I take in advance
for the first night.
If you need something,
I'll be downstairs...
All right.
The child isn't well.
Her parents aren't in yet.
What shall we do?
To take her to a doctor.
is that far?
Yes. To take a taxi...
She is burning with fever.
The room's full. Wait here.
This is too thin.
I get another blanket.
They wouldn't be this late
without informing me.
Let's get out. You're so tired.
I'm looking for Hasan Adali.
Who did you say?
Hasan Adali.
Wait a minute.
This guy is looking for you.
Yes?
Sister's.
Yusuf?
It's finished is it?
It's finished sister's.
When did you come?
Last night.
Come, come in!
Did you say" Hello"
to your uncle, son?
Come on! Say" hello"
and kiss his hand!
She made the kid
just like herself.
Every night he is in front of TV,
she is in the room...
No sound! Not a word!
Come on,
You should be hungry.
One would go mad here
without this.
I always look for
this hour of the day.
Welcome.
Come on boy,
eat your dinner.
Come on! You want
an invitation?
You pigheaded!!
Sit down here.
They want to punish me.
Get up! Fuck you
It's same for years.
As if I'm their enemy.
When I come home she goes
to her room, he to the TV.
come and say "Hello"
ask "am I hungry or sick?"
No, never... A dog or me...
What have I done to them?
I may say it's better to be in jail.
After you've gone to prison,
the hell fallen over us.
The earthquake has taken everything we
had.
You should have seen
the poverty.
Hunger, misery... the people
who had money left town.
Only people like us stayed.
No one looked after us.
We lived a life of misery
among the ruins for years.
Let's take it as the will of God,
but what about her?
She acted worse
than the earthquake.
I was accused
of being a pimp.
Everyday a bunch of bastards are in
front of home...
They're looking for her.
cause we have the reputation!
Get up! Go to bed!
Come take him to his bed!
Look at her. As if you killed
her mother not her lover!
Don't brother! Don't do it.
She didn't even cry after
your mother and father died.
She didn't go to the funeral. Anyway
they save by death...
This is your brother,
he was in prison for the sake of you.
Brother!
You ate nothing.
Don't be like a stranger.
Then I decided to go
where ever I can.
And at last
I came to this town.
No matter What I did
I couldn't soften her.
I thought of suicide many times.
Tell me, say so!
What have I done to her?
It's me who lost his pride!
It's me who was deceived.
For how many years
I couldn't face my relatives.
I ask you, what is my crime?
cause I behaved like a human being?
took care of her?
What have I done,
so she acts like an enemy to me?
You merciless! You bastard!
What have I done to you? . .
You dump bitch! You where!
You buried me in the grave!
You destroyed my life!
You finished me up! You killed me
Good morning brother.
Am I disturbing you?
No, I just woke up.
Hotel keeper told me.
You took care of our girl.
Thanks. So nice of you.
Don't mention it.
How is she now?
She is better this morning.
It's nice.
Come have a look at her.
Look.
I'm happy to see you well.
Did you have breakfast?
No.
You came from Adana?
Hotel keeper said so.
Yes
You'll head for Istanbul?
Yes. If God allows...
What for?
There is a job... If I may...
What's your profession?
I've none. I'll look around for.
What were you doing
in Adana?
I was in prison.
Did you stay there long?
Ten years...
That's a long time.
But you look well though.
What do you do here?
I came to visit my sister.
before I head for Istanbul.
And you stay in the hotel?
You?
It is a complicated matter.
What do you do today?
I just walk around...
Right. What can one do
in a strange town?
I saw you on the bus
the other night.
They called us for a party.
We quarrelled with them.
The bastards gave us away
Sari, give me one more.
What do you do?
There's a filthy club.
We make a music program.
Give me a soup,
and some cold water.
Did you lick off salt?
Come on, Sari!
How he thinks of selling
these goods?
We share the same room.
He has beautiful posters...
Sari! Soup?
Thanks. Have a good day.
What are you going to do?
I'll look around...
Then, back to the hotel.
I would say "join me"
but you may get bored.
No. You go your way.
But I invite you
to the club tonight.
We sit and talk.
OK.
On the Istanbul street.
The restaurant Orchid.
I'll be there...
OK. See you, bye...
Bye...
Hey! Brother.
I forget to ask your name.
Yusuf.
And me, Bekir.
You're like a good friend.
Thanks...
Bring us Raki
Thanks...
Dear guests
After ten minutes break...
...we'll be together again.
Welcome
Thank you sister.
Sit down.
Your name was Yusuf?
I heard what you did for my girl.
So nice of you.
I did nothing.
Anyway, you go enjoy...
I have something to do.
What did you do today?
I took walk in the town.
They haven't serve you yet!
You will ex cuse us Yusuf.
Don't mention it brother.
Bekir, How Are you?
Fine brother Mehmet.
What about you?
All the same. Just working.
Would you drink tea?
If you have it's nice...
Sure.
Hello
Hello. Is there anything?
We're waiting for Mrs. Ugur.
She's upstairs. Shall I call?
She knows we're waiting.
Come sit here.
Would you like to have tea?
Thanks, we'll have it.
What's the matter?
Nothing's the matter.
Do something?
What?
He wants me to go to him.
Who wants that?
The interrogating magistrate.
The interrogating magistrate?
He is going to take me to him.
Just a minute.
Let him alone.
I said stop!
What are you doing?
He's doing the interrogating
magistrate's orders...
You're not going anywhere!
Get out of my way Bekir!
Don't interfere you two!
Go out and wait for me.
I won't send you
to those pimps alone!!
Bekir get out of my way!
Don't do this to me Ugur!
I' II make you regret it!
Get out of my way you bastard!!
Ugur, I said I' II make
you regret it!!
Do what you can pimp!
Let's see what you can do!!
You ungrateful bitch!
I ate my life for you!
Now you say pimp ha?
Bekir, don't do it!
Stop there you bitch!!
Wait for me in the car!
Shoot me!
Come on, shoot me!!
Shoot me,
you son of bitch!
That's the way! Don't forget this,
or take your shit off!
I'I I come back.
She was threatened.
All of them denied it
In realty, they are cowards.
But nobody has courage
to be opposed to them.
You're the only person
who can do that.
Bekir, drink this.
Take this too.
Try to sleep. If you need us,
we'll be downstairs.
Sertan.
No mom, please go away.
Let me see him. .
Oh, my god, Sertan!
What have you done, why?
Please forgive me.
I'm grateful to you for my happy
childhood and my youth.
But in return for your sacrifice, not to be
impotent I had to suicide.
It was the only thing
what I could do. I just did it.
If you want me to be in peace,
you must married soon.
The only wish I have is to call
if you have a son, Sertan.
Mom, Daddy...
My son...
Oh what a pity!
This a film Mehmet brother.
They do it to make us cry.
What the hell! It 's too much...
A Turkish professor discovered
"the meaning of life."
It's beginning of a new period for the
science and the philosophy.
He is nominated
for the Nobel award.
"The meaning of life" is soon
without any censorship.
How are you?
Are you feeling well?
What's your name?
Çilem, She's mute and deaf.
Wake up, Yusuf
lt' s time for soup.
I take the girl out.
You too are coming.
Where?
To the Hidden Heaven,
It 's a nice place. You'll like it.
This is his store house!
In fact, he's setting
background with these.
Really he is from
the intelligence!
What do you talk about?
I'm saying that
he is watching us.
No, brother.
He is a poor fellow like me.
What about Istanbul?
Are you going?
I haven't decided yet.
Don't linger on here.
You'll get used to it. Come on!
Don't forget her there
drinking too much!
As if she is a lighter
to be forgotten!!
No one can trust you.
Come on. Yusuf 's waiting.
Bekir, don't forget
for the breakfast.
Good morning Yusuf.
How are you?
Thanks, we're going out.
Please take care Çilem.
I can't trust this crazy man.
OK. Sister. Don't worry.
This machine isn't working!
Take it, and try once! Come on,
No brother,
I don't know noting about guns.
You just pull the trigger,
that's all.
No brother, no!
Why not?
Was it a murder?
They don't put one in a jail
for ten years with no reason.
Who did you kill?
My best friend.
The day when we came back home
from the military service.
Was it because
of jealousy?
My sister was married.
They have ran away together.
I found them that night.
And your sister?
I shot her too.
The bullet hit her mouth
and tore her the tongue.
Then she moved here
with her husband.
Why is the child mute?
By birth
When Ugur was pregnant,
she was beaten by her father.
Where is her daddy?
In Sinop.
The guy in prison?
The other day
I saw Ugur going to prison.
Her lover.
Are you in this town
because of him?
And you?
It 's a long story. So murky.
We're grown up in the same
neighbourhood with this bitch.
Her father was an alcoholic.
He died early.
She's left with her mother.
They were extremely poor.
My family got some wealth.
And there was this Zagor.
His father was working
in the film companies.
He was a thief for pockets.
but the bastard was attractive.
Ugur fell in love with him.
I was a well behaved guy.
I was going to school then.
We were grown up just so.
What the shit! I waited for the military
service!
Then It was the time.
I was drafted.
My parents seemed
to wait for it.
When I came back home, they clanged
to me like leeches.
They found a girl.
We were married.
Dad gave me two taxis
and opened a shop.
I used to sell furniture.
One day this bitch came
into the shop.
I can't forget my heart's aching
with her love.
She wore a printed
skirt knee length, no stockings.
Her blouse was showing
beginning of her breasts.
She was like a jewel
as you can guess!
She made fun of me and
I was totally taken aback.
I had her in my mind
from that day on.
The day after,
I asked about her.
No man left in the district
who hasn't fucked her.
But she was in love with Zagor
who has been in prison.
One day,
she passed by my shop.
I started to follow her.
After shopping, she took a bus.
And we came to the prison.
There was a pain in
my heart. I got the idea:
she was visiting Zagor.
I was so jealous.
But not very long, I heard that
they ran away together.
By that time
Zagor got out of the prison.
About a year, they were lost.
But the bitch was always
in my dreams.
I couldn't forget the day
she came into my shop.
I couldn't even touch my wife.
Then we heard Zagor had killed two men.
One was a police.
He cut their throats.
He was tortured by the police
for five days.
They were taking
the revenge of their friends.
They did the same
to the bitch too.
First it was said Zagor was dead.
Then he was in coma.
These happened
in Ankara.
The bitch one day came
to the neighbourhood.
Zagor was inside. At best,
he was sentenced to lifetime.
One morning in the shop,
I saw the bitch sitting there.
I couldn't recognise her
at once.
Then I felt as if a screw was
pushed inside my heart.
Her face was white,
and sunken with despair.
But she was still beautiful like
arabesque songs.
She stood upright
and said she needed money.
It was for lawyer of Zagor.
I' II pay you later" she said.
Without thinking,
I asked her "How?"
"A whore or I may even be
your mistress." she said
Something settled inside me. I began to cry.
Oh! How I cried!!
And that day I believed the bitch.
20 years have passed.
Zagor was sentenced
to a lifetime penalty.
But he didn't stand still
even in prison.
He always crimed.
So he went from one prison
to another in years.
The bitch followed him.
I followed her too.
First I lost the shop.
Then the cars... My wife left me.
Dad closed the doors at me.
I set off on a journey
for the sake of love.
I have no trade, no skill.
The bitch doesn't care.
First she started small prostitution,
then became used to it.
She was closing her eyes
and lay with anyone.
I begged her to go back
so many times
I' II convince Dad and
we'll look after Zagor.". . No.
She followed him to where he went like a
dog. I couldn't see what he did to her.
How many times
I came back to Istanbul.
Doctors, hodjoas...
nothing helped...
Each time I found myself
on the way to her.
Once I saw that
she was married and pregnant.
We deceived her husband saying
I was her brother.
Thought I was saved.
She seemed fine. The only thing
interested her was her child.
These happened in Sinop.
I returned back to Istanbul.
Zagor tired an uprising in prison
towards her birth.
He was sent to Diyarbakir prison.
Not long after, the bitch became uneasy
and went to Diyarbakir.
For three days she was lost.
When she came back,
her husband beat her terribly.
The girl's deaf and mute
because of this.
Then she gave birth to her.
When she realised the truth...
one night she took opium and
stabbed her husband,
She ran away to Zagor with child.
Luckily, the husband didn't make
a complaint against her.
I was working in my taxi
in Istanbul at the time.
Again in all my dreams
It was her.
I had heard that
Zagor was in Diyarbakir prison.
One night
after I drank a bottle of raki,
I opened my eyes
I saw snowy mountains.
And young boy says
"Get up, we're in Diyarbakir."
I was really there.
I asked about her.
I found her there in a slum.
She wasn't surprised to see me.
We didn't say anything...
but said to myself.
"My son Bekir, there is no way.
It's useless to fight.
This is your fate.
Keep your head down
and walk on this way quietly".
From that day on,
I walk on this way quietly...
Nobody loved me like you did.
Help me to find a job. I can be a salesgirl,
a worker, what ever else.
I don't want to return to lzmir.
I want to be with you.
I want to be with you too...
...but if you stay with me the people
will talk about you?
If you marry me, they can't.
You want tea Yusuf?
Yes. I put the child
into bed and come.
Ex cuse me.
No brother, come in.
Mrs. Ugur wanted
you to go to her room.
All right, I' II go.
Ah Yusuf! Come in.
Sorry. I made a haste,
In case you go out early.
Are you busy today?
No.
Now I have to go to Aydin.
But Bekir has gotten drunk.
Really I' II go alone
but I am scared a little bit.
If you're not busy,
do me a favour.
Of course sister. But. .
Never mind Bekir. In truth,
I don't want him to know it.
If he asks you say
you had been somewhere.
All right sister.
Then let's get going.
We have to hurry.
Bekir got mad again.
He drank all the day.
Where is he?
He went out. He asked of you
for a few times.
He shouted out all day long.
Where is Çilem?
She's in bed.
He attempted to beat her once.
The pimp! Yusuf, If he asks you, say "
I didn't see her."
If he provokes you, be still.
OK. Sister.
He looks for trouble.
He drank a big bottle of Raki.
And smoked two cigars of opium... like this.
Brother what's the matter?
Fuck you! You bastards
That's all right brother.
Fuck your brother!!
Where is that whore!
Go out bitch!!
You finished my life
You ate me you!
OK. Brother Mehmet.
I' II take care of him.
Leave me you bitch!!
You ate my life out!!
Come on! Come give me
what you give to others!
Leave me you!
son of a bitch!
Who am I here to you?
All time with other men.
Enough! I give whom I want to!
Got it.? Mine it is!
You bastard fuck you!
Don't hang on me!
Whore!!
I'm a whore!
You are a whore!!
I'm a whore!! So what?!
Brother don't do it!
You're a whore too!
I' II shoot the hell out of you!!
No sister, don't do it!
Get out of my way!!
Sister, don't do it, I beg you.
A whore!! A whore!!
I will fuck you me too!!
Let's get out and
let him sleep.
Shall I wait here?
Don't worry. He is used it.
We just poured hearts out.
He was jealous of you,
Never mind him.
Sometimes even I can't stand.
You want a smoke?
No sister, thank you.
My neck is stiff I guess.
Can I ask you to massage?
Those parts are like stone
Yeah! Just there...
You're worried
what happened?
Bekir drank too much.
Do you like him that much?
He is like a brother to me.
He is nice.
Yes. But he is a fool.
See him in the morning.
As If nothing has happened.
He'll say Yusufcuk, Ugurcuk...
Be careful when he drunks.
All right.
Not that he will do a shit,
the fool can't a kill a chicken,
but sometimes he loads
himself. Then I get scared.
I'm as mad as him.
I help provoking him.
I couldn't get used to this
for 20 years.
When you went into prison were you
married?
No.
Your fiancee? Or a lover?
None.
Better No.
It would be harder then.
Thank you.
Now I feel better.
you could massage me
But it's too late now.
I'm tired.
I' II be up early tomorrow.
I take your leave sister.
Thanks. Goodnight
Goodnight.
Come to breakfast morning.
I' II come sister.
Brother Mehmet, hurry up!
They're using up the kid again!
Alo, alo, Brother Güven... fuck...
Sit down, sit down.
I'm already late.
Brother Mehmet, we're leaving.
Good evening Ms. Ugur.
You take Çilem to the room.
I' II try to come back early.
A man came to see you.
He told you to visit them.

Who is he in the prison?
My husband.
They'll cause trouble.
Let them do.
It's you whom they want.
No, why should it be me.

What do they want then?
Maybe they get bored.
Why the hell

Going against everyone,
not caring for anything?
Eat your soup.
Don't bother me.
I'm thinking of the child.
What the hell is she to you?!
I want your well being.
Shut up.
You're acting like Bekir.
I told you not to interfere.
I' II manage it.
How?
Was it you settled it for years?
There was Bekir then.

we're going to be happy.
Are you sick?
Are you sick? I asked.
No.
You have a problem?
No.
So what is this face?
There is nothing wrong.
Well then
Sister

happen to you!
Where to?
Anywhere. They closed the club.
There is no life for us here.
Your job is finished here.
Leave tomorrow morning.
I can't. .
Why not?
Because of you. .
What the hell that means?

You want me to take my slip.
Shall I break your heart?
Every man tasted it.?
Come man, Come and taste.
I beg you sister stop it!
Why stop it?!
We haven't started yet!!
Why didn't you say at the start.
Why 's this sudden act of bullying,
fakes of jealousy.
I loved you, sister.
What's wrong with it?
What the hell love is?!
Stop these actor's words,
you pimp!!
What can I do sister?
Is it a crime?
Surely it's a crime!
What did you think?!
Why did Bekir kill himself?
Why am I on these fucking
roads for 20 years?
Why am I under the men
who can't even fuck their wife?
I want it to come to and end.
What the hell will end?
Why are you so confident?
They are fucking the man there.
All of them 're fucked for money.
Am I the only whore you think?
You're doing it to yourself.
Fuck you! This is a penalty.
for whom the judge gives
a death sentence?
Who is beaten and tortured?
Who is made a whore
and who is killed of hunger?
Who blasts his brains out?
The ones with no honour,
sacrificed like sheep?
Or the pimps who sell their lives for cheap
comfort?! Tell me who?
Twenty years passed.
There is no place to go.
Nothing to say anymore.
You either let go to
where ever it can.
Or take your baggage.
You're really leaving ha?
I wanted to see Ms. Ugur.
Who shall I say?
She's waiting for me.
I' II call her.
Ms. Ugur told you to see her.
Come downstairs later.
There is a good film.
You want some?
I' II go to Aydin tomorrow.
There is a man from the past.
He wants to talk about a job.
If everything goes well,
it might be a new door for us.
Any way I'm bored here.
Perhaps we can move there...
What do you think?
You know for the best.
Was I too hard on you?
Any how, I wouldn't say
I wasn't impressed by you.
I believed in your sincerity.
I never showed but it was the
same with Bekir too...
I liked his madness and jealousy.
What a filthy creature
this human being!
You look like you're ill.
Go to bed, I'll take care of Çilem.
I'm scenarist.
Scenarist, please forgive me
Brother, What time is it?
Eleven thirty.
Don't worry. Perhaps
she stayed in the night.
Where is the whore?
Speak Goddamn speak!
Where did she go?
Speak you bastard!
Lie down. Don't move.
How is your foot?
The onion relived the pain.
Remind me to change it.
Let's put in salty water too.
So it wouldn't be swollen.
OK. How is Çilem?
She is fine. She watches TV.
What did Police ask you?
For Ugur.
Nothing else?
No. What did she do to
provoke them so?
Mrs. Ugur's lover ran way
from the prison.
Ugur told me not to tell you.
She left you some money.
She told you to wait
till the police calms down.
Then you'll go to Aydin
with the child.
There is a hotel, hotel Sercan.
that you have been before;
You will wait for her there.
They'll meet you
"Be careful of the police"
she said.
Where is she now?
She didn't tell me. It wasn't right.
You mustn't act hastily.
Ms. Ugur is a brainy woman.
She's being careful for
she guesses what might happen.
You too, be careful.
The hotel is under watch.
Don't worry, let time pass.
Sister... I'm leaving tomorrow.
Who is looking after here?
Yes?
Are you in charge?
Wait a second.
You have a room?
For how many?
Me and the child.
For how long will you stay?
We haven't decided.
Your identity card?
Who is there?
Sorry, just a minute.
Hey! It's for you.
The club's closed Brother?
Don't you have any business?
I was looking for Mr. Gonca.
He went away last night.
Why do you look for him?
I came to see him.
One of his friends sent me.
Where did he go?
To heaven...
What you got to do with him?
I was going to ask him
about someone.
Whom?
Ms. Ugur...
Are you her relative?
No. Child is hers.
She wanted me to bring
her here. So I did.
Is she her child?
Yes.
Do you know her man?
No, I don't.
He just ran away from prison.
He was here last night.
They were talking inside. Suddenly
the guns were fired.
The bastard riddled Gonca
with bullets and ran away.
Exactly 14 bullets. The pimp unloaded
the whole drum!
Gonca has 7 brothers.
They're strongly supported.
They start looking
at everywhere in Ankara.
They wouldn't stop
without finding him.
Get lost as soon as you can.
Leave Ankara immediately.
If they find you, they wouldn't even
have pity for the child.
Who is the owner of this place?
Just a minute...
May I help you?
I'm looking for
Orhan Kaya's father.
Uncle Mevlüt... He must be the
owner of this place.
Did you say uncle Mevlüt?
Yes.
It has been years
since he left this place to us.
I think he moved from here.
Did you ever see him?
Who is this uncle Mevlut?
Remember the man
working in the films.
I didn't see.
I just remembered him
Didn't he have a son
in the prison?
Orhan Kara.
I don't know him.
The man was ill.
He wanted my father to buy
the place. So we did.
I haven't seen him till then.
Maybe he is already dead?
Nobody knows brother!
Why don't you look for him
in the film companies?
They would surely know him?
You're right.
Kopil 'll show you the way.
Kopil!
Yes brother.
Show him the street of
film makers.
OK. Brother.
Thank you.
I hope you find him.
Good evening.
Are you Uncle Mevlut?
Here, son. It's me.
My name is Yusuf.
I'm a friend of Orhan
from the Prison.
You always tried.
You always lost.
Let it be. Try again.
Lose again.
Be a better loser.
