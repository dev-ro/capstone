SIFU: Kung fu is more than
a system of fighting.
It's a system of thought.
You must out-think your opponent,
whatever form he takes,
because some of them
will be more than just men.
BRUCE:
What else could it be, sifu?
SIFU: We all have
inner demons to fight.
We call these demons fear
and hatred and anger.
If you don't conquer them,
then a life of a hundred years
is a tragedy.
If you do,
a life of a single day
can be a triumph.

He might die.
He was making trouble.
He started it.
He's the nephew of the assistant

I can hide out

You don't have

(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
Oww!
The cops will be back.
I should get out of here.
Sit down.
I've thought
a lot about this...
For a very long time.
You'll have to
leave Hong Kong.
For how long?
Forever.
This is a joke, right?
You're joking.
Listen to me, Sai-Fon, you'll
die in Hong Kong. I've seen it.
You're too superstitious,
Ba-Ba.
You're a man now. Almost.
You have a right to know everything.
You had an older brother.
He died in childbirth.
The demon took
him away from us.
The firstborn
man-child is very valuable.
So when you were born, I name
you Sai-Fon, a girl's name.
We dress you in
dresses so the demon
wouldn't know I
had another son.
I made you speak English,
all so we could fool him.
But now he knows.
And he's coming for you.
You must leave tonight.
Where, Ba-Ba? Where can I go?
You love American movies.
You love American cars.
You go to America.
America?
I was in America on tour with the
Canton Opera Company in 1940.
San Francisco.
Doing The Drunken Princess.
November 27th, you were born.
That morning I got you
and three good reviews.
I was very proud.
Come here. Come here.
This
is your birth certificate.
"Bruce Lee."
It sounded very American.
It sure does.
(LAUGHING)
You were born there. Show
this to the immigration man.
They have to let you in.
You need money
to go to America.
It's yours.
I saved it for you
for a day like today.
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll do better.
Tell me you'll make a big noise in
America, so I can hear it over here.

James Dean.
French fries. The sky's the

Not a Chinaman's chance.
They say that too.
You ever hear that?
No.
You know, the Chinese,
we built the rail roads there.
The Americans, the gwailo,
would lower chinamens
over the cliff in
baskets to set the dynamite.
Get pulled up too slow, bang!
Rope break.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Americans say,
"Not a Chinaman's chance,"
and round-eyed
gwailo would laugh.
We're not human to them.
How do you know?
I'm a history teacher.
Things are different now.
It's today.

I'm different.

Can you teach us?
Can anybody do it?

It's secret chink stuff.

All right.
All right.
WOMAN: Hi, guys.
GUYS: Hi, Linda!
Hi. Hi.
Hi.
Um,
is this class only for guys?
'Cause it looks like
you only teach guys.
I teach whoever wants
to learn. Usually guys
are the ones
interested in fighting.
I've dated some
of these animals.
I've done plenty of fighting.
Ha ha.
But seriously,
I'd like to take lessons.
How about Friday? 3:00?
That's a date.
(CHUCKLES) No,
that's an appointment.
There's a difference.
See ya, Bruce.
Bye, guys.
GUYS: Bye, Linda.
BRUCE:
Emotion can be the enemy.
If you give in to emotion,
you can lose yourself.
Be at one with your emotions,
because the body
always follows the mind.
This is not about winning.
This is about perfection.
Then why all
those colored belts?
The only thing belts are good
for is to hold your pants up.
Okay, let's spar, shall we?
Urn, Linda?
Linda and...
(CHUCKLING) Linda and me, I guess.
Come, Linda.
Go get 'em, Linda.
(LAUGHS)
Remember reference? Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Set?
You're open.
I saw it coming.
Uhh!
Yeah!
There you go. You see? It isn't
size or strength that matters.
It's focus. You all have
a chi, an inner spirit.
Focus and then there's nothing
you cannot bend to your will.
Like you just saw.
Find your reference
points and square off.
Good.
I kinda like this position.
Then say "yes" to a date.
All of us?
No, just you and me.
Why?
Why?
Yeah, why? Why me?
'Cause I already fell for you.

I don't think I could kiss
somebody who wasn't white.
I... I just don't
think I could do that.
I'll try and live with
that thought. I really will.
You'd kiss him?
Kiss him? At least.
You'd let him put his tongue in your mouth.

Who knows? Maybe more.
You are so low, Emery.

Okay. Thank you.
Okay.

Have you ever

What do you think
I've been doing?
No, but I mean really going for it.
In the American way.
Making a business.
A chain, like McDonald's.
(LAUGHING) I like teaching,
but...
Oh, sure, it's fun to throw
helpless girls on the floor.
Seriously, I like
the way it changes people.
You can't change people with your fists.
I've learned that.
See,
they see something strange,
something they
don't understand,
and they get afraid.
Teach them the beauty of that strange
thing and they're no longer afraid,
because it's
become part of them.
Well, sometimes strange things
can be very beautiful.
Excuse me.
It's been half
an hour and I still see
people being
seated ahead of us.
Come, don't exaggerate.
It's been barely 20 minutes.
Like to have

What were you thinking?
I'd like to take

someplace good.

We wanna have children,

Ah. But what will they be?
They won't be white

They'll be some

So we've got a little trouble.
This is more than
a little trouble!
Okay,
so we've got big trouble!
You're always going on about the
beauties of your Chinese culture!
Let me tell you
about the beauties
of my culture!
We love big trouble!
That's what you say now!
In six months,
you'll be looking
for the back door!
Oh, no, it's never
gonna be over
between you and me!
You get it?
Go back to your mother, Linda!
I'm finished!
Tell her I made
a mistake. Do it!
You hear me? Tell her you made a mistake!
Don't touch me!
I don't want you here!
I don't want you! Get out! Go!
Leave me alone!
Don't look at me like that!
(CRYING)
(THUNDER)
(RATTLING)
Who is it? Who's there?
(SIREN WAILING)
(CLICK)
Who is it?
Who's there?
Hi. I thought I'd
improve the view.
Oh,
look at the big kung fu man.
First sign of trouble
and all he does is quit.
Shut up! Shut up!
See this notebook? Looks like the
ones we had in school, right?
Wrong. This is your future.
I don't have any more future.
Sure, you do.
You know, all I keep hearing
is the fight took too long.
Too much tradition,
too much classical mess,
too many fixed
positions in Wing Chun.
You know everything
that's wrong, so fix it.
Stop whining and
start fighting.
Fight back with your mind.
I can't write, I can't move!
You talk, quitter. I'll write.
I'm waiting.
It would take forever.
You goin' anywhere?
I'm not.
Oh, yeah,
there's just one more thing.
I'm pregnant.
The great mistake is to anticipate
the outcome of the engagement.
You ought not to be thinking of
whether it ends in victory or defeat,
but let nature
take its course,
and your tools will
strike at the right moment.
The consciousness of self
is the greatest hindrance
to the proper
execution of all...
The knowledge and skill you have achieved
are meant to be forgotten.
So you can float...
To obtain
enlightenment in martial art
means the extinction
of everything which...
The way to transcend karma lies in the
proper use of the mind and the will.
Jeet kune do is not to hurt,
but is one of the avenues through
which life opens its secrets to us.
Relaxation is essential for faster
and more powerful punching.
Let your lead punch
shoot up loosely and...
(GRUNTING)
And what? "Loosely and" what?
Loosely and easily!
"Easily." okay.
Do not tighten up
or clench your fists
until the moment of impact.
Aah! Aah.
Okay, come on. Come on.
All punches should end
with a snap several inches
behind the target.
Okay.
Morning, ladies!
Congratulations, Mr. Lee.
Thank you.
Yaaoow-toh-unh! Wah!
Hey, kiddo.
He's too young to shave.
They aren't shaving mirrors.
They're called pat kwa.
Pat kwa?
They're like
gargoyles on churches.
You put them around to
ward off evil spirits.
I wanna call him Brandon.
Brandon.
That's good.
Do you wanna hold him?
(BRANDON CRIES)
Oh, look at daddy.
Hey, big guy.
Come on up here. Shh!
He's so tiny.
Hi, baby.
Don't be afraid.
He's so tiny.
You're beautiful.
Bruce?
Bruce, come here! It came!
Yeah?
Look! It's here,
it's here, it's here!
Oh.
Open it! Open it up quick!
(LAUGHING)
Whoa!
It's your book!
It's your book.
LINDA: Look at that.
(LAUGHING)
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
Okay, hold on. I'll get it.
Hi.
(SIGHING) May I come in?
Why?
I like your hair.
Come on, Mom, I don't
wanna chitchat with you.
What are you doing here?
I came to see you and...
Did you come to see me,
or did you come to
see the yellow baby?
I think maybe I
made a mistake.
Brandon, it's Grandma!
Grandma's come to see you!
Come on in, Grandma!
There's someone
you ought to meet.
Come on.
How are you feeling, Mr. Lee?
Oh, like half-man, half-car.
Glad to hear it.
Linda, your mom's got
great legs. Great legs!
He looks...
Well, he...
He looks like both of you.
May I?
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
There you go.
Hello. Yes.
You're such a handsome fellah.
He's gorgeous.
MRS. EMERY: He's so sweet.
Oh, yes, you are.
You did good, sweetheart.
You sure did good. Gosh, yes.
Look at you!
(BRANDON comma)
Brandon, you're a strong one.
Only you could do this.
BRUCE: The art of jeet kune do
is simply to simplify.
It favors formlessness so
that it can assume all forms.
Kung fu, karate, tae kwan do.
All the classical
styles are attempts
to arrest
the flux of conflict.
But in actual combat, the opponent
doesn't wait for formalities.
He's not a robot, but a human being,
fluid and alive.
(CROWD BOOING, CHEERING)
(BOOING)
For instance... For instance!
Like a sculptor who doesn't
keep adding clay to a statue,
but strips away the inessentials
until the truth is revealed.
I have developed a way of
fighting with no fixed positions,
with no set movements.
(BOOING, CHEERING)
(BOOING CONTINUES)
The fancy mess of martial arts
solidifies what was once fluid.
It is nothing but blind devotion
to the systematic uselessness
of routines that lead nowhere.
(BOOING, SHOUTING)
MAN: Calm down!
(BOOING CONTINUES)
Calm down! Calm down!
(BOOING GETS LOUDER)
Tell him to prove it!
Yeah!
Tell him to prove it!
Mr. Lee is not
here for competition.
CROWD: (CHANTING) Prove it!
Prove it!
All right, calm down, calm down!
Keep it quiet! Mr. Lee...
Prove it! Prove it!
Prove it! Prove it!
Okay!
Okay, I'll prove it.
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
I'll need
someone to prove it on.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
I'll beat any man in
this room in 60 seconds!
(CROWD BOOING)
What?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
MAN: I'll fight him!
I beat him before!
I beat him again!
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE CONTINUES)
What are you, crazy? The
doctor said no more fighting.
They told me I'd
never walk again, too.
When will you be happy?
When they're right?
Bruce, I'm begging you.
If you love me...
This isn't about you and me.
Fine!
But I'm not going through this
again, do you understand me?
You get hurt,
you're on your own.
Don't go too far, hon!
It'll be over in 60 seconds.
(CHEERING, BOOING GROW LOUDER)
This is a challenge match
to prove Mr. Lee's
theories on jeet kune do.
Sixty seconds.
(YELLING, CHEERING)
Bow to the judges.
Bow to each other.
Begin!

Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Bruce Lee! Bruce Lee!
Yeah!
Hey, Mr. Lee!
Bill Krieger's the name. You looked
pretty great out there today.
No, he didn't. He was too slow.
He took too long.
(LAUGHTER)
You looked pretty fast to me.
You think you can do some of
that stuff in front of a camera?
I'm a TV producer and...
Right, and I'm Marvin Gaye.
(LAUGHTER)
I'm casting my new series.
It's called The Green Hornet,
and I think we could use you.
So, d'you hear I bought
a house on the beach?
Right in Malibu.
I'm tellin' ya,
I got 120 yards of
sand as my front yard.
That's too tight.
I can sell the stunt.
You don't have to cut
off the circulation.
Cal, run him
through the scene.
As soon as you get your cue light,
you come through that door.
Then you work your way
down this catwalk here.
Be real careful as you
negotiate this corner.
I want you to get down these
steps as fast as you can.
(CHUCKLING) Not too fast.
I don't want you to tumble. I don't
want to lose you on the first show.
When you get to this landing,
do you think you could take
these five steps all at once?
I'll try.
Atta boy.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR:
First positions, everybody!
(BELL RINGING)
Hey, can you tell it's me?
I just talked to the network.
They love the dailies. They love 'em.
Don't they always?
Yeah. Listen, there's, uh...
There's one small problem.
Lemme call you back.
Yeah, what is it?
Uh, it's this guy Lee.
You know, he's awfully...
Oriental.
He's supposed to be oriental.
Yeah.
He's playing an oriental.
I know, I know. What?
Kato is oriental.
I know, I know.
Uh, can you just make sure
he keeps the mask on?
Roll sound! Roll camera!
And mark it!
Action!
All right, Green Hornet,
where's the secret formula?
Where it belongs.
Okay, have it your way.
(FLAME IGNITING)

Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Good work, Kate.
Thanks, boss.
Huh? Ah, cut, cut, cut!
(ALARM BUZZES)
That's a print.
Thought that'd be
a little more exciting.
BRUCE: If he came from Hong Kong,
he'd end up in San Francisco.
KRIEGER: I don't
wanna do the urban thing.
BRUCE:
We helped with the rail roads.
How about the Wild West?
Okay, great. The Wild West.
Okay.
Chinese immigrant
wanders the land.
He's a good guy, a hero.
Of course he's a hero.
He's the star of the show.
He wanders
the land solving problems.
Every week he
solves a problem.
With no gun. Just his hands.
That's good.
That's great. No gun.
He's looking for something.
His father. He lost his
father who came ahead of him.
No, no, not the father.
The father thing has been done to death.
He's searching
for his brother.
Good.
Searching for his brother.
He never finds him.
Not until the fifth year.
He wanders the land,
searching for his brother,
solving problems with no gun.
And he has something
no one else has ever seen.
Kung Fu! Starring Bruce Lee.
Kung Fu! Uh-huh.
He remembers
what he was taught
in the old
country by his teacher,
and teaches
people his culture.
After he's kicked the shit
out of everybody. Fantastic!
We've got action, culture!
It's a western!
But it's an eastern.
It's an eastern.
Right. It's an eastern.
They're gonna love it. This
thing's gonna run forever!
- Kung Fug
- Kung Fu!
(MAKING FIGHTING SOUNDS)

BRUCE: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
So what are they saying at
the network about Kung Fu?
Right.
And when do you

Oh, Bill, Bill, Bill.
What about dinner?

They still haven't made

BRUCE: It comes, it goes.
SIFU: In your dream?
BRUCE: No, I'm always awake.
It's not a dream, sifu.
When your father first brought
you here, he told me everything.
He wanted you to
learn wing chun
to protect
yourself against man
and other forces.
I thought that was
all superstition.
Superstition is a name the
ignorant give to their ignorance.
You were special then,
and you're special now.
That's why
the demon wants you.
(REPLACING SWORD IN SHEATH)
We have spent a lot of time
together, preparing you for this.
Good. Good.
(CHUCKLING) Very good.
What if I won't fight him?
You have no choice.
You're fighting for
more than yourself.
What are you saying, sifu?
As I told you, this
demon is your inner fear.
It doesn't matter how
many men you defeat.
If you don't
conquer your own fears,
you will pass your demons
on to your children,
as your father
passed his on to you.
No.
You will fight him.
When you are at
your absolute peak,
he will come to you.
When the monsoon blow,

I'm on the level.
You're Kato, and over here, Kato

Something we can build on.
(PANTING CONTINUES)
They don't call your show The Green Hornet.
It's called The Karo Show.
Did you know that?
Well, it's true.
When I hear Kato is in town,
I consider it a good omen.
I've got to get
back to my family.
Leave tomorrow.
I've been away for so long.

No, Fred's got a script.

No. Here is where

I want you to come with us.

I worked in America for 10 years

It got me nothing.
It got you me.
Oh, man.
They got such

"It's for everybody!"
Yeah, it's for everybody white!
But they don't tell you that!
You gotta read the small print!
If you can read.
I am not America.
Your kids are not America.
Don't push us away.
We're going.
I want you to come with us.
I want the kids to

Don't lay any

I'm not taking

I thought we were partners.
I made you my partner!
We are partners!
I told him
without you, no deal.
"A co-production in
association with Philip Tan"?
That's an insult!
You could get more.
It's not about getting more.
We don't need them!
Yes, we do.
It's Warner Brothers,
big budget, in English,
with

Don't sell me, Bruce!
Don't sell a salesman!
Do you have an aspirin?
I don't know, man.
I don't know

You want their love so bad.

When I was a kid,
I had all these crazy ideas.
I wanted to show the world the beauty
of our culture, to give them a hero.
But a Chinese hero.
You have.
Don't you see that?
I want something else now.
I want to stop
breaking my wife's heart.
I want to play

LINDA: Three weeks before the
opening of Enter the Dragon,
the film that brought
him international fame,
Bruce fell into
a mysterious coma and died.
He was 32.
Over 25,000 people attended
his funeral in Hong Kong,
but I buried him back home in
America to be close to us.
All these years later, people still
wonder about the way he died.
I prefer to
remember the way he lived.
