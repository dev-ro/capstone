25.000
The island of Cyprus, madam.
World famous for beauty
and long, tragic history.
Been conquered many times.
Conquered by Phoenicians, Assyrians,
Persians, Macedonians.
Also conquered by Greeks, Romans,
Byzantines, Turks.
Purchased from Turkey
by your esteemed self, the British Empire.
All Cyprus most fond of the British.
I'm an American.
Fond of Americans also.
We Cypriots are fond of everybody.
Shall we go through the castle now?
No, I've changed my mind.
Then maybe the Tower of Othello
at the harbor of Famagusta.
-It's included in the tour.
-All right.
What's the matter here?
Prison ship has arrived
full of Jews for the camps, madam.
-What camps?
-Detention camps out at Karaolos.
You see, the Jews, they charter a ship
from Europe to get to Palestine.
Then the British catch the ship
and send the whole bunch here.
The Arabs don't want them in Palestine.
The British don't want them here, either.
-But they got them.
-Stop!
Get him!
Maybe you can back up
and drive me to this address.
House of the British Commander.
Now, then.
-Get his feet.
-Right.
Up.
Mrs. Fremont?
The General's expecting you in the garden.
How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?
I'm very glad to see you.
Please sit down.
Found that here in the garden.
From the color,
I'd say it belongs to the Byzantine period.
The Byzantines occupied
Cyprus for centuries.
Gives one an idea how temporary
our claims to the world's real estate are.
I'm ashamed to say I really don't know
anything about archeology.
Few people do.
Didn't you once publish something
about the Roman ruins in Cheltenham?
A very obscure something. How did you know?
Tom mentioned it in one of his letters.
He was very proud of your friendship.
As I was of his.
Will you have tea, or something livelier?
Something livelier, please.
-Is that ice I see?
-Surprised?
Tom got me into the habit.
Now I use ice in practically everything.
There we are.
May we drink to Tom?
Of course.
I'm extremely sorry circumstances
compelled us to bury him in the field.
Even sorrier I was
transferred from Palestine...
...before I got the chance to see you.
It wasn't your fault.
It took me almost a week to arrange passage.
But your letter was waiting there for me,
and Tom's things.
I really shouldn't have let him go with us.
It was only a border affair.
One of the Jewish undergrounds
had blown up half a dozen bridges.
It really wasn't important enough
to lose one's life for.
Is anything?
In my opinion, yes.
I've known many soldiers, Mrs. Fremont,
and war correspondents...
...and news photographers,
such as your husband.
But I think perhaps Tom
was the bravest man I've ever met.
We have a saying in Indiana:
"The braver the bird, the fatter the cat."
Perhaps.
Do you recognize this photograph, General?
Of course. It was his last.
Do you remember how Tom got that shot?
We were together.
I must confess, my eyes weren't on him
when he snapped the shutter.
The aircraft came in low.
We were both in the truck.
I jumped down on one side to take cover,
and Tom jumped down on the other side.
Tom couldn't have taken cover
and photographed the plane as he did.
I dare say you're right.
He had a strong sense of duty.
He also had a strong sense of death.
I felt I had to confirm what I suspected
about the last photograph.
I'm very grateful to you.
That's over a year ago.
How have you been occupying yourself?
-After I lost the child I was-
-The child?
Didn't Tom tell you we
had a child on the way?
Men like Tom are often quite reticent about
things that are nearest to their hearts.
I understand.
It was quite late in my pregnancy
when Tom was killed.
Apparently the Palestine trip was too much.
I lost the baby in the
hospital at Jerusalem.
And then I went back
to my old profession of nursing.
I've just completed my tour of duty
with the US Public Health Service in Greece.
Very good. What are your
plans for the future?
I haven't quite decided yet.
I may travel a while before I go home.
I have passage booked on a freighter
that sails next week to Istanbul.
From there I may go to India.
I've always wanted to
see the Vale of Kashmir.
It's probably the most
beautiful spot on earth.
Mrs. Fremont, may I introduce Maj. Caldwell?
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
-Have a drink.
-Thank you. I'd love one.
-How did your disembarkation go?
-Smoothly.
We're really up to our neck in Jews, sir.
Karaolos bursting at the seams
and more to come.
I still say we should send them back
where they came from.
Two loads were shipped out of Haifa
bound for Hamburg.
I don't see why we can't do the same thing.
I shouldn't like to have a hand
in sending a Jew back to Germany.
Squeeze them in as best as you can.
They're squeezed in.
Short of bed space, supplies...
...short of nurses, short of temper,
short of everything.
Mrs. Fremont's a nurse.
Why don't you lend a hand at Karaolos?
No, General. I'm afraid I couldn't.
I've really been quite tired lately.
And I don't know anything about them.
About the Jews?
I feel strange among them.
In what way?
Now that you mention it, I can't think.
It's just a feeling I get.
-Will you have another drink?
-Thank you, no. I really must leave.
I'm touring the island
and my guide is very firm with me.
-I'll take you to your car.
-Thank you for the drink and the talk.
Drive by Karaolos on your tour.
Ring me if there's anything I can do
to make your stay more comfortable.
I will.
I'm very fond of the
old man. One of the best.
Makes it all the more difficult
to explain his little quirk.
Quirk?
About the Jews.
You caught it all right. I was watching.
Almost makes one believe the story
one hears now and then.
Probably nonsense, but still...
What story?
That if you gave a good shake to his
family tree, you'd find a Jew up there.
Please tell Gen. Sutherland
I've changed my mind.
I'll be happy to work at
Karaolos for a few days.
-Goodbye, Major.
-Goodbye.
-Do you need any help?
-No, thanks.
-Good night, then.
-Good night, and thanks for stopping.
Ari! Ari Ben Canaan!
-Reuben. How are you?
-Fine.
The car's up there.
Good. We'll go directly to Mandria.
We can't, Ari.
He's on the other side of the island.
-He won't be back until tomorrow.
-He should be on this side of the island.
British checkpoint, Jewish checkpoint.
We don't allow our military personnel
in the camp area...
...unless something extraordinary occurs.
We handle the outside.
The inside's up to them.
-Lieutenant, this is Katherine Fremont.
-How do you do, Mrs. Fremont?
American. Authority Gen. Sutherland.
Pass her at all times.
-Very good, sir.
-Thank you.
These Zionist organizations,
or whatever they call them...
...send their own people over from Palestine
to administer these camps.
Jews seem to respond
better to their own kind.
Perhaps we all do.
We even give them the privilege
of approving all Gentile personnel.
-I hope you don't mind.
-Not at all.
-Good morning, Ben Ami.
-Good morning, sir.
This is Mrs. Fremont,
an American friend of Gen. Sutherland.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
Ben Ami is one of the Palestinians
who run this camp.
Mrs. Fremont has a few days to while away
in Cyprus, and being an experienced nurse...
...the general thought you may find
her assistance valuable.
We find all assistance
of value, Maj. Caldwell.
-Would you show him your passport?
-Of course.
Any friend of Gen. Sutherland's
is always welcome.
Convey my respects to the general,
and thank him for us.
Of course. Goodbye. Good luck.
-Call us if you need us.
-Thank you.
-Would you care to come with me?
-Surely.
Yesterday's shipload
will double our hospital capacity.
It's very good of you
to help us get organized.
-Leave me alone.
-You're burning up with fever.
If you don't let us clean out the infection
you'll die, that's all.
After coming so far, you'll die
without ever having seen Eretz Israel.
I'll see Palestine before
you. Now leave me alone.
This woman is trying to help you.
-Do as she says.
-Who are you?
He's the Palestinian commander, that's who.
A Jewish policeman, working for them.
I know your kind from Auschwitz.
-You can't tell me what to do.
-We'll see.
-I'll hold him.
-Just try.
Dov! If you don't let
them help you, you'll die.
I want to die.
You don't know what you're saying.
I'll take them off myself. It won't hurt.
Keep away from me, all of you.
Excuse me.
I think I can talk to
him better if we're alone.
We came on the Star of David together,
and I know him. He's just shy.
Don't get too close to the glass.
Dov Landau, you ought to be
ashamed of yourself. Put that down.
I won't.
That hurt.
Not half as bad as it will hurt.
I'll teach you. I'll beat you all over.
Well? Do you let them
take care of you or not?
Not them. But if you want
to do it, well, all right.
Thank you.
And don't you ever spit on me again.
Just remember.
-It's all right, I'll do it.
-How did you change his mind?
Just patience and kindness.
Yetta will show you around.
Don't hesitate to call on me if I can help.
Thank you.
Now, this is pavilion number two.
Excuse me.
This boy has a skin
infection called impetigo.
-He needs sulfathiazole on those scabs.
-lf the camp has no such drug?
Leave him alone.
That will spread it all over his body.
-You think so?
-I know it. It's terribly contagious.
My dear, it's this way.
If you have no sulfathiazole...
...and no ammoniated mercury ointment...
...which was the earlier pharmacology,
you soften the scab with soap and water...
...and gently remove it like this, you see?
Then expose the lesion
for five minutes to the sun.
That's also a cure.
-You're a doctor.
-By coincidence.
It was stupid of me to interfere.
I'm a nurse. I'll be working here
for a while. Please forgive me.
Dr. Odenheim, it's time for you to rest.
You've been up all night.
I know how to do this.
-He taught me on the ship.
-Thank you, child of light.
I'll find you something to wear
over your dress, a gown or an apron.
Thank you.
My name is Katherine Fremont. I'm a nurse.
-You can call me Kitty.
-My name's Karen Hansen.
Hansen?
-Then your mother was Jewish?
-Yes, and my father.
-Reuben.
-Shalom, Ari.
-David, how are you?
-Shalom, Ari.
-Mr. Mandria, this is Ari Ben Canaan.
-Welcome.
Very pleased to meet you.
We've heard good things
about you in Palestine.
-Rumors. But I like them.
-So do we.
Please sit down.
-Cigar?
-No, thanks.
Well, David,
how many people have you got by now...
...in that barbed wire jungle of yours?
Over 30,000.
And they're building for 30,000 more
on the other side of the island.
How many arrived yesterday
on the Star of David?
Six hundred and eleven.
We're going to take the same 611 off
the island and land them in Palestine.
-Six hundred and eleven?
-He thinks he's Moses.
We haven't been able to break more
than 10 or 15 at a time out of Karaolos.
This will be a new experience.
One thing more. There's a time limit.
Today is Tuesday.
We'll stage the break next Monday.
-Next Monday?
-Why not tomorrow?
Ari, we cannot do it.
The United Nations
will vote on the Palestine issue...
...before the end of this session.
Between now and then
we have to show the world...
...thousands of homeless European Jews...
...are not going to accept any solution
that bars them from Palestine.
A mass escape of the very same people
who arrived on the Star of David...
...is worth more than a million speeches.
But this isn't the Red Sea, Ari.
It's the Mediterranean.
Right. Smite these waters as you will,
they do not part.
That's why you'll have to get us a ship.
I want a legitimate freighter...
...with legal registry and real cargo
we can unload here in Cyprus.
A ship for six...
That's a wonderful idea.
Brilliant.
But the expense will be brilliant also.
Not too brilliant.
You know, our treasury
is based on donations,
and right now we're rather low.
-Well, can you deliver or not?
-I'll do my best.
We Cypriots are with you.
For the Jews, Mandria will do everything.
The Jews have paid you well
for your efforts, Mr. Mandria.
-Ari, you've got to understand-
-No, Reuben. I say it.
Do you believe that l, Plato Mandria,
would do this for money?
Do you think I'd risk
10 years in prison for money?
I tell you, it has cost me over £5,000
since I work with the Haganah.
You owe him an apology, Ari.
I do apologize, Mr. Mandria.
It was a stupid remark.
Not necessary.
If I apologize each time I get stupid,
I'd spend a lifetime on my knees.
-Also, we'll need 14 lorries.
-14, he says. Why not 1,400?
The British have requisitioned every car,
truck and lorry on this island.
Haganah makes mistakes
just like anybody else.
This is one of them.
David, I want to hear every objection,
every criticism, every
suggestion, but only once.
-Now the boat project is under way, right?
-Almost accomplished.
I will send a telegram
to a shipbroker in Athens.
-Don't the British monitor telegrams?
-Naturally.
But some of the monitors are Cypriots.
They'd like the Britons in Britain,
the Jews in Palestine...
...and the Cypriots in Cyprus.
Not, mind you, that I'm anti-British.
If I must have a master,
the British are far the best.
But the problem, my dear friend, is,
why have a master at all?
Shouldn't have hurt him,
Ari. He's a real friend.
Maybe, but don't let the Mandrias fool you.
They work for us and say
how terrible it was...
...that 6,000,000 Jews went into the oven.
But when the showdown comes,
we always stand alone.
Mandria will sell us
out like all the others.
We have no friends, except ourselves.
Remember that.
You're wrong,
but you'll have to learn that for yourself.
Now tell me, how is Jordana?
I think she's in love.
You've had this letter
since last night-
I forgot about it.
He's in love with her,
so he thinks everyone is.
He's right.
She mention me in there?
Thank you.
-No, thank you.
-None for me.
How did you know I postponed my departure?
Central Intelligence has a great talent
for spying on the innocent.
It'll interest them to learn
that I have a plot under way.
Good. Can you tell me about it?
There's a child at the camp
I'd like to take out for a holiday.
Just for luncheon,
and perhaps to buy her some clothes.
Then I take it
some of the strangeness has worn off?
I know it was foolish to say that.
But I can't help it. I do
feel strange among them.
Except for this girl.
Somehow she's entirely different.
Her point of view, the way she works...
...she acts, feels and speaks
almost exactly like an American.
I can think of no higher praise.
You're laughing at me, and I deserve it.
I'm not laughing. I'm simply glad it worked.
-What?
-I wanted you to get interested...
...in something
beside your own troubles, and you did.
It's interesting that you saw it so fast.
-Of course, you were absolutely right.
-I'm glad you weren't offended.
I shouldn't like you to become a woman...
...who drifts through
life, "fair to no purpose...
"...artful to no end,
young without lovers, old without a friend."
Do you have a solution?
If I were 20 years younger
I'd offer myself as a solution.
The Vale of Kashmir is no good
unless you share it with someone.
Places don't mean anything.
Only people are important.
Fill your life with people.
Let Tom return to the
grave where he belongs.
Fred!
-Yes, sir?
-There's a child out at Karaolos...
...Mrs. Fremont would
like released for a day.
What's her name?
Karen Hansen.
-See to it for me, will you?
-Very well, sir.
-Isn't it a little irregular?
-Extremely.
That's why I want your signature on the pass
instead of my own.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Isn't she a beauty?
You must have towed it across.
All right, she's no beauty,
but her heart is solid oak. You'll see.
Ari!
Hank, how are you?
Hank Schlosberg from Cincinnati.
He's run more ships through the blockade
than anyone.
This is Mr. Mandria, who
arranged for this tub.
-Not a bad ship.
-Not a good one, Mr. Mandria.
For the money we pay,
every ship cannot be the Queen Mary.
Can this abortion make it to Palestine?
On my mother's honor,
she has made 300 trips...
...from Cyprus to Turkey
under her last owner.
That's just the trouble.
We can hold her together for one more round.
I want a loudspeaker system aboard.
Get me a power unit
and six Almec-Thorston speakers.
There is no such equipment
for sale in Cyprus.
If you can't buy it, steal it.
Stock it with provisions for five days.
-For a two-day trip?
-Five days.
All prepared foods,
either canned or packaged.
The most expensive, naturally.
-Have you got my jeep yet?
-I told you, it's impossible.
A jeep is out of the question, absolutely.
-Need someone to overhaul the engine tank?
-No, my gang can take care of that.
-Mr. Mandria?
-Yes?
What about that jeep there?
That belongs to His Beatitude...
...the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Cyprus.
Steal it. Paint it. Hide
it till I'm ready for it.
The water's wonderful.
May I have another swim before my steak?
Just once more,
because we're due back at the camp.
-Is that the girl?
-Yes.
Swims just like an American.
-I'll buy you a drink if
you'll forget that joke.
I just had one.
She is nice.
Would it be too difficult to arrange
for me to take her back to America?
Not from our end.
We'd be glad to let them all go.
So long as they don't end up in Palestine.
Let me know when you've decided.
I'll get Maj. Caldwell
to arrange it for you.
Thank you.
Karen.
Coming.
Would you like to go to America?
Of course. Everybody likes to go to America.
Then you will go.
I'll cancel the rest of my trip,
and I'll take you with me.
And you can go to school there,
and later on to the university.
And if you like it, and want to,
you can become an American citizen.
You mean, go right away?
Perhaps. In the next week or two.
Meanwhile, I may be able
to get you out of camp.
I'll speak to the general tonight.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
You do want to go, don't you?
Yes, but I mean...
I must think about it a little.
-What is there to think about?
-I don't know.
But it's so important,
and I need a little time.
You know, to think.
Take all the time you wish.
-Kitty?
-Yes?
-Don't be mad at me.
-Of course not.
It's getting late. You
better finish your steak.
Fine thing, what you want to do for Karen.
She told you?
She is worried about her father.
I didn't know that her father was alive.
When Karen was six,
he smuggled her out of Germany to Denmark.
After the war she went
back to find her parents.
The Jewish Agency had records of the dead.
She found her mother on the Dachau list...
...together with her two younger brothers.
About the father there was nothing,
so naturally she hopes he is still alive.
Maybe in Palestine.
As a matter of fact, there
is such a possibility.
He was a very important scientist.
The Nazis could have spared his life...
...in order to use his brain.
But of course, who knows?
It's curious
that she didn't mention her father to me.
You must understand something
about these children.
Their past is scarred.
They're ashamed of it.
To have a parent who has been persecuted,
or killed in a concentration camp...
...is a reproach to them.
They feel guilty for having survived.
So they pretend the bad
things never happened.
To take such a child is
a great responsibility...
-...even a sacrifice.
-It's no sacrifice.
I'm alone. The insurance I got after
my husband's death is more than enough.
I didn't mean financial sacrifice,
although it's a good thing to have money.
No, what I meant was,
you will have to make
a sacrifice of yourself.
These children who have lost everything...
...spend their lives
searching for new parents.
Their need reaches out to your heart
as naturally as a flower turns to the sun.
And they trap you.
Because they've been so long without love,
they demand all the love you have.
Karen will drain you of
love. She'll exhaust you.
That's exactly what I need.
I'd like to go with you, Kitty.
If you still want me.
-Morning.
-Morning.
-Bowen, 23rd GT Company.
-What can I do for you, sir?
Afraid I'll to have to
draw rather heavily on you.
-Please have a chair.
-Thank you.
This does draw us down a bit.
Excuse me a moment.
-Operator.
-CO, please.
Won't take a minute.
I hope not. As you can see, I'm in a hurry.
-CO speaking.
-Hall here, sir.
I've an order at transport
pool, sir, for 14 lorries...
...4 motorcycles, 18 drivers and 18 guards.
Estimated use four hours, sir.
-What's this for?
-Transport from Karaolos, sir.
-Who is requesting this?
-Capt. Bowen.
-What authority?
-Sir Cecil Bradshaw, of the Colonial office.
-Yes.
-Countersigned Lt. Gen. Sutherland.
-Well, allocate it then.
-Yes, of course, sir.
-What's the query?
-I thought you might want...
...to draw extra transport
from headquarters.
-Don't babble on, man. Give it to him.
-Yes, sir.
And get on with it.
Very good, sir.
Smithers. Take this and
get it filled at once.
-Yes, sir.
-We'll have you taken care of in a jiff.
Can I order tea for you?
Rather prefer a gin and
tonic, if you don't mind.
-Bowen, 23rd transport company.
-Lt. Arnold, sir.
I want to see the
Palestinian camp commander.
Right this way, sir.
This is the Palestinian commander,
David Ben Ami.
-How do you do?
-How do you do?
We are relocating all the internees
from the Star of David.
Here are your orders.
Where are you taking these people?
Their destination is not
included in your orders, Mr...
-Ben Ami.
-Yes. Thank you.
These people have not recovered
from their last journey.
I cannot permit them
to travel again so soon,
just because of a piece of paper.
Piece of paper?
-This seems perfectly clear to me.
-Sir, some of these people are sick.
You will turn the internees over at once.
I'm sorry. I just cannot
accept that responsibility.
I'll take the responsibility.
-There, does that satisfy you?
-Of course, I don't approve, but...
...I guess it makes the record perfect.
Would you order him
to place all his Palestinian...
...administrative personnel at my disposal
while loading?
-Did you hear?
-Yes, sir.
You can call on me
if you run into any trouble, sir.
Thanks, old chap.
Well, let's get about it.
Attention.
All passengers from the Star of David,
listen carefully.
We have received orders
to evacuate you immediately.
I repeat. All those who arrived
on the Star of David...
...are to be evacuated at once.
{lease prepare to board the British lorries
now passing through the camp.
Report at once
to your nearest {Palestinian guard point.
What does this mean? HMJFC?
His Majesty's Jewish Forces on Cyprus,
what else?
-What's going on?
-Military police.
They're blocking the intersection
for through traffic.
I don't understand.
Go and find the commanding
officer, will you?
I'd better look into this myself.
Excuse me, Mrs. Fremont.
Stay here.
-Sergeant, clear the way for my car.
-Yes, sir.
I'm afraid this is most unusual.
We've had no warning.
I'll check with headquarters.
These orders are perfectly clear.
Signed by the Colonial Office
and countersigned by Gen. Sutherland.
What's this? The whole area's tied up.
-Who's in charge?
-O'Hara.
Permit me. Bowen, 23rd GT Company.
Special detail, orders of Gen. Sutherland.
Here are the papers, sir.
Well, Bowen, I see you're going to be
getting rid of some Jews for us?
-Yes, sir. Shipping them back to Hamburg.
-That's where they belong.
It's a German matter.
Let the Germans handle it.
Apparently the general's
had second thoughts.
Why do you question these orders?
I didn't question.
I just wanted to check with headquarters.
Countersigning is not the responsibility
of junior officers.
The acceptance of responsibility...
...is what makes senior
officers out of juniors.
-Let them through.
-Yes, sir.
Should have started this
policy two years ago.
I don't care about the
Jews one way or the other.
-But they are troublemakers.
-No question about it, sir.
Get two of them together,
you've got a debate...
...and three, a revolution.
Yes. And half of them are Communists anyway.
Yes, and the other half pawnbrokers.
They look funny, too. I
can spot one a mile away.
Would you mind looking into my eye?
It feels like a cinder.
Certainly.
You know, a lot of them
try to hide under Gentile names.
But one look at that
face, and you just know.
With a little experience,
you can smell them out.
-I'm sorry, I can't find a thing.
-Must've been my imagination. Thanks.
Maj. Caldwell, are they taking everybody
who was on the Star of David?
-Yes, ma'am, we are.
-Then Karen's on one of those trucks.
Karen?
Karen Hansen.
I have Gen. Sutherland's permission
to take her to America.
-We were on our way to pick up the girl.
-How old is she?
Fourteen. She was assigned to the hospital.
Yes, it seems to me...
Is that the girl that the...
...forgot his name, the camp commander,
was talking about?
David Ben Ami? Yes.
He knew she was supposed go with me.
I remember. He told me
the general had made arrangements for her...
...so I left her behind,
on my own responsibility.
-Very good, Bowen.
-Thank you very much.
I appreciate your help.
Convey my respects to the general.
That I will.
-Bit of a Jew himself, you know.
-Not really?
Good luck, sir.
Remember, I've been in Palestine.
I know what kind of life
she'll live, if she lives.
I grant you that.
Besides, she must have been forced,
otherwise she would've left a note.
We'll get her back for
you, one way or another.
With her consent, of course.
Who was in charge of this evacuation?
Chap named Bowen, sir. Capt. Bowen.
-What did he look like?
-Look like?
A well set up sort of chap.
Proper bearing, decent decorations.
Spoke like any of us.
-From what command?
-23rd GT Company, sir.
-Is anything irregular?
-Could be.
We don't list a 23rd GT Company on Cyprus.
You should have known that.
Yes, I should.
-Perhaps I made an error.
-It's human.
Who issued Capt. Bowen's orders?
They originated with Bradshaw
of the Colonial Office.
And, of course, you signed them.
-You examined the signatures?
-Well, naturally, and I countersigned.
I signed no such order.
Neither have I seen such an order
from the Colonial Office.
Well, those signatures must've been forged?
We can't exclude the possibility.
With one exception, of course.
-Your signature was genuine, wasn't it?
-Someone had to take responsibility, sir.
And you took it. Now you've got it.
What do you propose to do with it?
That boat...
That Olympia...
She's not going to Hamburg.
She's probably heading for Palestine.
Undoubtedly.
Telephone control, tell
them to block the harbor.
Take a look at the situation yourself.
Very well, sir.
Mrs. Fremont. Sir.
Let me have the microphone.
Attention, Olympia. Attention, out there.
This is Maj. Caldwell speaking.
Attention, Olympia.
You have no chance to escape.
The destroyer Zebra is moving into position
to block the harbor entrance.
Return to dock.
Otherwise we will board you.
We're bound for Palestine
with an American captain and crew...
...and a passenger manifest of 611 persons.
We're carrying 200 pounds of dynamite
in the engine room with fuses attached.
You let one British soldier step aboard
this ship and we'll blow her up.
Have you heard me, Major?
Message received.
Where would they find
200 pounds of dynamite?
-Get me Gen. Sutherland.
-Operator.
-Connect me to Gen. Sutherland.
-Yes, sir.
In an ammunition dump, you blithering idiot.
-Sutherland here.
-Caldwell here, sir.
The Olympia threatens to blow herself
out of the water, sir, if we board her.
I'm convinced it's a bluff, of course.
Boarding party en route, sir.
Call your boarding party back.
Signal the Olympia.
I'm asking London for instructions.
If she stays where she
is, no one will molest her.
They've threatened to dynamite
the Olympia if we board her.
Do you think they mean it?
Nearly two years ago, a Haganah ship
which we were detaining
in the port of Haifa...
...did blow herself up. 236 refugees died.
General, I simply must
get Karen off the ship.
Would you care to go on board the Olympia...
...and learn from the child
exactly what happened?
-Will they let me?
-I'll try and arrange it.
If I succeed, you can
do me a favor in return.
I'll do anything.
If force, or coercion of any kind,
was used to get that
child on board the ship...
...you must promise me to
tell the entire story...
...at a press conference
which I shall arrange.
-Do you agree?
-I'll be glad to.
Reuben?
Send this every 10 minutes,
and keep on sending it.
-Could we interrupt, please?
-Yes.
This is Dr. de Vries. We elevated ourselves
into a medical committee.
Good.
It's our opinion the sanitary arrangements
on this ship are hopelessly inadequate.
Unless we make some additional
bathing and toilet facilities...
...we'll have a serious health problem.
All right, we'll try to take care of it.
There he is. This is Mrs. Fremont,
from Gen. Sutherland.
-How do you do? Hank?
-Yes.
We have enough scrap lumber
to build privies on deck?
I guess so.
Ten-holers. Knock some
showers together, too.
Okay.
-Anything else?
-Not for the present, thank you.
This one to Haifa.
You wanted to see me?
Yes, Captain.
"Yes, Captain." His
Majesty's Jewish Brigade.
North Africa, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine.
The decorations are real.
Is that what Sutherland
sent you to find out?
You lied to me about the girl.
She's not at the camp, she's on this ship.
And you forced her to come aboard.
-We don't force anybody. Tel Aviv yet?
-No.
Go on.
You're not listening.
I heard every word you said.
I lied to you about the girl. What else?
I'm taking her off this death trap.
Don't tell me what you'll do on this ship.
You'll do exactly what I tell you.
-Tel Aviv beginning to send.
-Fine.
How do you know the girl wants to get off?
I am trying to save a Jewish child.
Can't you understand that?
Don't you have any respect for human life?
Don't expect me to get hysterical
over one Jewish child...
...and don't you get hysterical, either.
You're late, lady. You're 10 years late.
Almost 2,000,000 Jewish children,
butchered like animals...
...because nobody wanted them.
No country would have them.
Not your country or any other.
And nobody wants the ones who survived.
Jewish flesh is cheap, lady.
It's cheaper than beef.
It is cheaper, even, than herring.
You and your respect...
Tel Aviv complete now.
If you can find the
girl, if she wants to go,
take her. Take a dozen if you want to.
Kitty!
It happened so fast,
I couldn't even leave you a note.
I had to go, Kitty, to find my father.
When you asked me to go to America,
I didn't know, and...
Kitty, we're going to Palestine.
Karen, you don't know what
it's like in Palestine.
And the British won't let you go, anyhow.
They'll have to, Kitty.
They'll just have to.
Because we're not going back to Karaolos,
not ever.
Then let me take you to Palestine.
I can find a way.
The man in charge, Mr...
Ben Canaan?
Yes.
If you want to come with me,
you have his permission.
I couldn't leave now, Kitty.
I don't know how to explain it
to someone like you.
But we all came here together,
and now we're trying to do something.
And I must stay here, Kitty.
Gen. Sutherland calling the Olympia.
This is the Exodus. Come in, General.
I have received instructions
from the Colonial Office in London.
No attempt will be made
to board the Olympia...
...but the harbor will remain blocked.
You may return to
Karaolos whenever you wish.
If you choose to remain in the ship...
...provisions and medical supplies
will be sent to you as you need them.
Message completed.
Not even now?
Kitty...
...I couldn't.
It's like leaving your
family when things are bad.
I know.
If you want anything, let me know.
Yes. Gen. Sutherland's your friend.
Tell him to let us go to Palestine.
They're just going to turn this ship
into another concentration camp.
Go back? Nonsense.
Did we escape for just ourselves alone? No.
We've done it for hundreds of thousands
of Jews all over Europe...
...who couldn't get out.
Also it makes news. World news.
I want your attention for a minute.
Now you all heard Gen. Sutherland
on the loudspeaker.
You must now make a decision.
You can go back to Karaolos...
The only way to go back to Karaolos
is by crawling!
...or you can stay aboard this ship.
Who are you making the propaganda for?
Them or us?
Quiet, please. There's another possibility.
You were picked by Haganah for this ship...
...so that your escape to {Palestine
would have some meaning to the world.
If you still want it to have some meaning...
...if you want to finish what we began,
you can go on a hunger strike.
Now you're beginning to make a little sense!
We shall tell to the British,
"We spit on your food."
And the little food we've got here,
we shall throw overboard.
We are going to Palestine,
or we're going to die right here.
Listen, please.
Now just stop and think for a minute.
To go on a hunger strike
is a very serious business...
...because once you strike...
...it can only end when you have won
or when you are dead.
What is so unusual about the Jews dying?
Is that anything new?
I stay right here.
There is no excuse for us to go on living...
...unless we start fighting right now.
So that every Jew on
the face of the earth...
...can begin to start feeling
like a human being again.
You heard what I said.
Fight, not beg!
Fight!
Wait a minute.
Everybody aboard this ship...
...agreed to accept Haganah discipline.
I am now giving an order.
We will sit down...
...and we will maintain
silence for 20 minutes.
Each one of us will
listen to his own heart...
...and to his brain, too.
And then we will vote.
We will now maintain silence.
I saw the people on that ship.
They're not dangerous.
They're just poor, miserable people.
Why can't you let them go?
You must understand that we British
have shown, throughout our history...
...an extraordinary talent
for troublesome commitments.
Palestine is a British
mandate imposed upon us...
...by the League of Nations...
...which makes us responsible
for keeping peace in the area.
The Arabs simply won't keep the peace
if we allow further Jewish immigration.
I don't know much about the mandate.
But I do know the Jews
were promised a homeland in Palestine.
During the First World War,
Britain needed and
accepted Jewish support...
...from all over the world.
In return...
...the Balfour Declaration of 1917
made such a promise.
That promise was reconfirmed
during World War ll.
This chap Ben Canaan probably wasn't lying
when he said he fought with us.
Thousands of Palestinians did.
How can you promise something
and then not deliver it?
England was fighting for her life in 1917.
Nations are very like people
in such circumstances.
They make promises
they're not immediately able to fulfill.
During that same crisis,
we made the Arabs certain assurances.
Hence, they have their claims, too.
The Arabs are fanatics
on the subject of Jewish immigration.
Just now, we need their goodwill.
-How is it ever going to end?
-I don't know.
The whole question now
is before the United Nations.
I hope they solve it.
The sooner I stop operating detention camps,
the happier I'll be.
That goes for every British officer
and soldier I know.
Thank you.
Yes?
The devil.
Of course.
Send a boat alongside at once.
I'll join you in 10 minutes.
They want to send 23
people back to Karaolos.
The rest have declared a hunger strike.
-Can I drop you at your hotel?
-Of course.
...a few news bulletins,
and an announcement.
The evacuation of 2,000 British women
and children from {Palestine...
...was ordered today by
the High Commissioner.
The United Nations Commission on {Palestine
still has not submitted its report.
The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem...
...who sat out the war as
Hitler's guest in Berlin...
...has met in Aley, Lebanon,
with representatives of the Arab nations...
...to coordinate action
against {Palestinian Jews...
...in the event {partition is granted.
The UN Commission on {Palestine
has arrived at Flushing Meadows...
...and is now preparing its final
recommendation for the assembly.
News of the hunger strike
aboard the Exodus...
...received front-page treatment
this morning throughout the world.
The British embassy in Washington
is already being picketed.
Now Dr. Odenheim has something to say to you
for the medical committee.
It is very important
that we save our supply of fresh water.
So we must ration it.
Every four hours, one cup.
On the other hand,
everyone must wash his body daily.
This will be done with seawater.
Your platoon leader will call
when your turn comes.
It is advised to conserve your energy.
So all necessary physical work
should be divided...
...among as many people as possible.
If at any time you should feel lightheaded
or dizzy, do not be frightened.
It is, in no respect, serious.
Just sit down
and lower your head between your knees.
All of us, of course, feel stomach pangs.
-They are uncomfortable, but not dangerous.
-That's right.
Final point...
...people can live a long time without food,
a very long time.
Attention, everybody.
Here is the news,
and some of it, I'm sorry to say, not good.
Dov Gruner and three other leaders
of the Irgun in {Palestine...
...were hanged today in Acre prison.
The United Nations Commission
on {Palestine is still delaying...
...its recommendations
to the General Assembly.
Winston Churchill has called on
the Labor government to end what he calls...
"...this squalid war against the Jews, "
with all possible speed.
-500 Americans picketed...
-Your water, gentlemen.
...UN headquarters in Flushing
Meadows, demanded release-
Your platoon's turn to bathe, Mr. Lakavitch.
Your turn to bathe.
Mr. Smolikov, will you please do me a favor?
Refresh yourself with my bath,
and then, little bit later, I'll take yours.
-All right.
-Thank you.
Sorry, Mr. Lakavitch. You know the rules.
-Can't you see the position?
-No exceptions.
I think you carry this bathing too far.
-No exceptions, Mr. Lakavitch.
-Fanatics!
...establishment of a Jewish state
in the Holy Land.
Thirteen leaders of our
National Committee in Tel Aviv...
...have begun a hunger strike
in sympathy with the Exodus.
When more news comes in, I'll report it.
That's all.
Have you time for me, Ari?
Always, Dr. Odenheim. What can I do?
We made a mistake...
...a bad mistake in letting the children
be a part of this.
A child's body grows every hour.
They need food more than adults.
Their blood requires more sugar.
What should we do about it?
When a mistake is made, you admit it...
...you analyze it, and you correct it.
Doctor, don't you feel well?
Who cares if an old man feels well?
Major!
-Who the devil are you?
-Jorgenson, of the UP.
-Thanks, Major.
-All right.
What is this?
-Information, sir.
-Information for whom?
For the tourists, of course.
One of our many special services.
And I suppose these are tourists?
No, sir. These people are contributors.
We are collecting
donations for the Red Cross.
Forgive me.
What did you say?
What were you two talking about?
I said to him:
"These are nice fat ones,
for this the archbishop will bless you."
He said to me, "l do my share."
Word for word, a literal translation.
Don't try to deceive me.
You're collecting all this for the Olympia.
-You see through me like a piece of glass.
-Complete waste of time.
They won't accept food
from us, nor from you.
True, but they will accept
from the Red Cross when they sail.
Perhaps you're right.
What do you mean, "when they sail"?
It was my poor way of expressing
confidence in British justice.
Good day.
You'd better go up and tell them.
Give me a hand here.
Let us through, please.
It gives me great pain to inform you
Dr. Odenheim has suffered a heart attack.
He is dead.
Shall I send it out?
Why not?
Professor Dr. Samuel Odenheim...
...head of the first clinic
for Internal Medicine...
...at the University of Vienna,
author of many medical textbooks...
...died today in the harbor of Famagusta...
...on board a cramped
freighter going nowhere,
because there wasn't room
for him on this earth.
Ought to make news somewhere.
Attention, please.
{prepare all children under the age of 13...
...for return to Karaolos. This is an order.
-Out to the ship once more?
-Yes.
You know, they're in their 92nd hour,
and starting to crack already.
-I didn't know that.
-Fading fast.
They never would have
started this nonsense...
...if Ben Canaan hadn't held a gun to them.
-Do you really think so?
-Undoubtedly.
Poor, ruddy beggars.
I don't see how you stand them.
Then let me ask you this, if I may.
Do you have the power
to call off this strike?
I have.
If a compelling reason turned up. Why?
Then call it off.
I've been talking to Gen. Sutherland.
He's a humane man,
but there's nothing he can do.
You've made the issue so flatly
that no one can help you.
I know it, I feel it.
Either you compromise, or you lose.
We won't lose.
If the British give in
and let us go, we've won.
And if we starve to death aboard this ship,
we've still won.
They'll wait.
They'll wait until you're too weak
and then come aboard and take you off.
It doesn't take much strength
to set off 200 pounds of dynamite.
You'd still set it off, knowing you've lost?
Of course.
Without any regard
for the lives you'd be destroying?
With every regard in the world for them.
I don't understand.
Each person on board this ship is a soldier.
The only weapon we have to fight with
is our willingness to die.
But for what purpose?
Call it publicity.
-Publicity?
-Yes, publicity.
A stunt to attract attention.
A letter to the newspapers.
A help-wanted ad to the official journal
of the United Nations.
"Wanted by 600 men,
women and children, a country...
"...a native land, a home."
That's all they're dying for.
Just to call attention to Israel...
...without ever having seen it themselves.
Does the vulgarity of it shock you?
You can't fight the whole British Empire
with 600 people.
It isn't possible.
How many Minutemen did you have
when they fired...
...the "shot heard round the world"?
-I don't know.
-77.
Look, please understand me.
I wish you could win.
I wish it were possible for you
to have a country of your own.
But it isn't.
You're offering the
lives of all these people
for something that can never happen.
I know. I've been in Palestine.
-When were you there?
-A year ago.
Mr. Ben Canaan, even if you get a partition
and a free Jewish state...
...the Arabs won't let you keep it.
500,000 Jews against 50 million Arabs?
You can't win.
You think I'm a fool.
But I came to appeal to you
to call off the hunger strike...
...and avoid a tragedy.
Why don't you appeal to Gen. Sutherland?
What can I tell him?
Tell him what God said to Moses:
"Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him,
'Thus saith the Lord:
"'Let my people go,
that they may serve me."'
Exodus, Chapter 7, Verse 26.
We have been asked to talk to you,
Mr. Ben Canaan.
-Do you have time?
-Of course.
Excuse me.
We have made a decision among the mothers.
To send the children back to Karaolos now
will show weakness.
The British will see that we are
not serious people aboard this ship.
It doesn't matter what the British think.
I cannot take the responsibility
for letting children starve to death.
We will take the responsibility.
We will not send them back,
and we will not go back with them.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Frankel.
The children must go back.
You go back if you want to with them.
Now, that's a Haganah order.
You're an important man,
Mr. Ari Ben Canaan, but you know nothing.
Look at these babies of mine.
Born behind barbed wire.
For the first time they don't have to
look out through a fence
like little animals.
They are free now, and nobody...
...no Englishman, no Haganah,
will ever lock them up again.
Look at Mrs. Hirschberg here.
Hers will be the first,
when she has no more milk to give.
-Tell him.
-I will not take him back to Karaolos.
He will go to Palestine with me,
or here on this ship, we will die together.
I will not take him back.
When are you going to stop this thing
and let them go?
Unfortunately, I can't answer that.
The affair's entirely
in the hands of London.
But you don't like what's going on.
You know how wrong it is.
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you make a
public statement about it?
I can't do that, Kitty. I'm a soldier.
I know you're a soldier,
but you're also a Jew...
...and all these people
out there are Jews, too.
I don't like to disappoint you,
but I'm not in any degree a Jew.
-But I thought...
-I know the rumor.
There had to be some explanation...
...for my attitude
towards this unpleasant business.
-I'm sorry for flying off like that.
-You're getting to be quite a Zionist.
As a matter of fact,
I'm glad you did fly off.
You asked how l, as a Jew,
could let this happen to other Jews.
Now I find myself asking
how can any man let it happen?
Jew, Gentile, Buddhist, Mohammedan...
...no matter what he is.
Signal the air base.
I'm flying to London within the hour.
You know, you're an interesting woman,
Mrs. Fremont.
Sutherland won't let one member
of the press come aboard...
...and you shuttle back and forth
like a carrier pigeon.
I know you suspect me,
and I know nothing I say
can make you trust me.
But I wanted to tell you
that Gen. Sutherland has left for London.
He understands your situation,
and he is trying to help.
Thanks.
Is that all?
I heard of Dr. Odenheim's death.
I'm a trained nurse,
and I worked with him at Karaolos.
If I can be useful, I'd
be glad to stay aboard.
Without food?
I think I can go without
food as long as you.
I'm glad to have you on board, Mrs. Fremont.
Glad to be aboard, Mr. Ben Canaan.
Whatever move you make,
you were dead 10 minutes ago.
I asked for an opinion from Romania?
Do you think the British will give in?
We'll give in first.
These schlemiels.
Maybe they think they've been hungry
once in a while.
They don't even begin to know
what real starvation is.
If you hate these people so much,
why do you want to go
to Palestine with them?
Because there, Jews fight instead of talk.
When I get there, I'm
going to join the Irgun.
They know how to do it.
I'm going to blow up every
British installation I can find.
I'm going to kill Englishmen...
...and kill and kill them...
...till there won't be any more.
-But the British aren't all bad.
-They're rotten, the whole bunch of them.
The British, all the
Russians, the Poles-
-Not the Danes.
When I was there-
Them, too. Don't tell me.
That's not true.
The Hansens were Christians,
and they adopted me.
One little exception. That proves something?
There are lots of exceptions.
You just listen to me for a minute.
When the Nazis marched into Denmark...
...they ordered every Jew
to wear a yellow armband...
...with the Star of David
on it. And when they-
-That's the worst thing that can happen?
-I said, listen!
You don't know what you're talking about.
The next morning, when every Jew in Denmark
had to wear his armband...
...King Christian came out of
Amalienborg Palace for his morning ride.
And do you know something?
He wore the Star of David on his arm.
-But why
should-
And you know something else?
By afternoon,
everybody was wearing Stars of David.
Jews and Danes, and, well, just everybody.
Why'd they do that?
If you don't just know
why they did it, Dov...
...well, maybe that's what's wrong with you.
-Get the Olympia. I want to talk to them.
-Yes, sir.
Control Headquarters calling the Olympia.
-Do you hear me?
-This is the Exodus.
Stand by for Maj. Caldwell.
You are no longer interested
in your last rook, Mr. Lakavitch?
We pause for politics?
Gen. Sutherland, at his own request,
has been relieved of his duties on Cyprus.
I have just received a message
from the Colonial Office. I quote:
"His Majesty's Government,
having no desire to witness
needless suffering...
"...grants permission
for the Olympia to sail to {Palestine...
"...and to disembark its passengers
at the port of Haifa. "
That is all.
Ari Ben Canaan!
Well, happy landing, Mrs. Fremont.
-You'll find your luggage at customs.
-Thank you.
Have you seen Mr. Ben Canaan?
I want to thank him for
letting me on the ship.
He and the other Haganah guys
went over the side two hours ago.
Too many British soldiers
on the reception committee.
-Karen?
-Have you seen Dov?
No, not since he left the ship.
-He was assigned to Gan Dafna.
-He'll show up.
I'm going to the American consulate
and then to the Jewish Agency.
As soon as I find anything,
I'll come to Gan Dafna.
Gan Dafna, all aboard.
-Bye, Karen.
-lf you see Dov, tell him where I am.
Inside.
This is no accident, he's got the address
written down. Fetch the car.
Here, you dirty little Irgun swine.
Hello?
Shalom.
Yaov, take the dog out.
Again?
A boy about 17 just went into Asa's house.
They took him in a police
car. Get a look at him.
-What's your name?
-Karen. What's yours?
Edna. Come, we'll go up and eat something.
Now, if you will please
resume a little order...
...I will introduce a man
who has done more than any other...
...to establish our village of Gan Dafna.
Only 10 days ago...
...he was in London,
negotiating with the British.
Today he is home again.
I have the honor to present
Mr. Barak Ben Canaan...
...member of the Executive Committee...
...of the Jewish Agency for Palestine.
My dear young friends,
I know you're very tired.
You've had a long trip,
so I'm not going to make speeches.
It's good to have parties like this.
But it's also good to
know what you're here for.
You are here to learn. You are here to work.
You are here to build
a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
It says on the banner
"young heroes." Very fine.
But here at Gan Dafna you will find
that even the biggest hero...
...must work in the fields,
just like the littlest coward.
Boys and girls,
when I came to Palestine 47 years ago...
...it was not a musical reception
with little cakes served.
I came walking, with my little brother...
...all the way from Russia.
And over in that valley,
the swamps, and mosquitoes so big...
...they were picking
fights with the sparrows.
Now we have changed those swamps
into such fields.
On a quiet night, you
can hear the corn grow.
Oranges so big...
...five already make a dozen.
Over there you see the
Arab village of Abu Yesha.
In those days, my old friend Kammal...
...may God rest his soul...
...was mukhtar of the village.
And then one day,
he donated to us this ground...
...on which you stand, for a youth village.
So, we began to build this place.
And again it wasn't a matter
of little cakes and music.
It meant more sweat, more work.
Look about you.
You will see Arab children here.
Three of them, grandsons
of that same Kammal...
...the mukhtar who gave us this land.
It grieves me that he isn't with us today
to see all this.
But he's been gathered
to the bosom of Allah.
Speak always that name with respect.
With us, instead,
we have the son of Kammal, Taha...
...an honor to his father's memory.
Raised part of the time in my house,
with my own dear son, Ari...
...and with my dear daughter, Jordana,
who sits beside him in this place.
I want you to give particular attention
to what he's going to tell to you.
Here is Taha, son of
Kammal, since five years...
...mukhtar of Abu Yesha.
Thank you, Barak Ben Canaan.
Village president, Dr. Ernst Lieberman.
In this valley of Jezreel,
we dwell together as friends.
It is natural that we should live in peace.
Since even our words for it
are almost exactly the same.
We say salaam...
...and you, shalom.
Let us seal our friendship forever
with that most beautiful of Hebrew toasts.
L'chaim, to life.
L'chaim!
Come on.
Dov Landau.
Immigration says you're legal,
so we've no reason to keep you.
The Jewish Agency sent a bus ticket
and lunch money.
You're assigned to Gan Dafna.
You take my advice and go there.
Don't hang around Haifa.
You'll get in trouble.
Don't wander into the Arab section.
Or you'll run into the Mufti's gangsters
and they'll kill you, son.
They'll slit your throat.
And keep away from the Irgun.
-And then, after the ghetto was destroyed?
-I hid in the sewers for five months.
Eating what?
When I couldn't sneak out at night
and steal garbage, I killed rats.
And then one night they caught me.
-And they sent you to Auschwitz?
-Yes.
To what work were you assigned in Auschwitz?
I told you that twice already.
It was mostly clean up.
-Cleaning up what?
-The camp area.
That's all there was to do.
That and working in the kitchens.
And when Auschwitz was liberated,
you walked to Germany?
You asked me that already, too.
May I talk with the young man for a moment?
So you want to blow up British installations
for the Irgun?
