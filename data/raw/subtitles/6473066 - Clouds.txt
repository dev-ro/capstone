[BOY NARRATING]
Wanna know a little secret?
Most teenagers out there
feel like they're invincible.
Not the Superman kind of invincible.
The kind of invincible
that tricks you into thinking
tomorrow might be a better day
to start chasing your dreams.
Or, like you have an extra ten minutes
to get somewhere when, clearly, you don't.
- [MOM] Okay. Front door service.
- [BOY] Thanks, Mom. I owe you.
[MOM CHUCKLES] I'll put it on your tab.
- [BOY] Hey, could you grab my crutches?
- Yep. Got 'em.
- Have fun up there, okay?
- [BOY] All right.
- Thank you.
- [MOM] There you go.
- Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
- [BOY] It's okay. Leave it!
[MOM] Okay. Go, go, go.
I'll see you in a minute. Have fun.
- [MALE STUDENT] 'Sup, Zach?
- Hey.
[ZACH NARRATING]
The truth is that even after four years
and, like, 20-something rounds of chemo...
I'm still figuring it out.
[MC] Thank you.
Thank you means leave. Stick to football.
- Hi, Zach.
- Hey, Mr. Reed.
[WHOOPING, CLAPPING]
[MC] I don't wanna see
some of y'all in a skirt again.
Don't clap for them. Don't do that.
Sorry about that. You know
that was uncomfortable to watch.
They didn't rehearse.
Let's give it up for some students
that actually rehearsed
to put on a show for us.
Give it up for
the Stillwater High Topaz Dance Crew!

- [SONG PLAYING]
[ZACH] And while there's a lot
that I don't know at my age,
what I do know is this:
What some people take for granted,
others are fighting for.
And believe me, I'm a fighter.
[SONG CONTINUES]
[ZACH GRUNTS]
- Zach?
- Hello.
Where have you been?
You know I like to make a big entrance.
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm gonna throw up.
We've been through this. Just breathe.
I know. I know. It's just everyone...
Everybody's killing it out there.
Look at Amy. She doesn't even have to try.
She was born graceful.
I was born to fall on my face.
[ZACH CHUCKLES]
You are painfully awkward.
Shut up. Sammy. Hey.
You sang it for me, and it was awesome.
[SCOFFS] That's nice,
but you are my best friend,
so you are morally obligated
to say nice things to me.
Everybody else out there
is not my best friend.
If everyone else doesn't like it,
then they're idiots.
Sorry.
- Just don't screw it up, all right?
- Ha, that's not funny.
[SAMMY EXHALES]
God, this stage fright thing is so stupid.
It's not stupid.
Look, if you're not ready to go,
then I will.
- [SONG ENDS]
- [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING]
- You will?
- Yes.
[MC] That's right. Keep it going.
Come on. Let me hear y'all.
All right.
- Knock 'em dead, good sir.
- You'll get 'em next time.
[MC] I'm not gonna hold you guys...
Hey, hey. Awesome performance.
Really liked that leg flippy dippy
spin move you did. Great form.
Well, I really liked that flippy dippy
thumbs-up thing you did.
That was cute.
[MC] Give it up for Sammy Brown,
everybody! Sammy Brown!

Hello, Stillwater. Whoo!
[CLAPPING, WHISTLING]
Thank you. Thank you.
Okay, so, um...
I know I can easily be mistaken
for Sammy Brown.
[AUDIENCE CHUCKLES]
But those of you
who are paying attention...
um, may notice that
she has slightly more hair than me.
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]
Actually, pretty much everyone
in this school has more hair than me,
now that I think about it.
- Even Mr. Weaver.
- Okay.
Ah, ha ha ha ha ha!
That's funny that he would crack that joke
'cause I actually volunteered
to shave my head off for you.
So you shouldn't be talking about me.
And I'm not gonna lie to y'all.
I won't do that for nobody else.
I'm not getting paid for this.
Just play your song.
Yeah, I'm special.
[MALE STUDENT] Yeah, Sammy!

They were definitely in my desk drawer.
Which I have to open

Anyway, the point is...
I really like them.
Cool. I'm glad you enjoyed them.
It was seriously nothing.
I was just bored.
Not trying to be Ed Sheeran or anything.
"Ed" who?
Oh, is he that little redheaded fella?
- You're hopeless.
- [LAUGHS]
Anyway, I'm just glad
you're not trying to be Ed or anyone else.

I can clean my own room.

wanna go out with me in the first place.
Are you serious?
[GASPS] You're bald.
Among other things.
Well, hair grows, first of all.
And she knows you beat it last time.
This round of chemo
is basically just a formality.
Yeah. [EXHALES]
Wait. How does she know that?
Oh, she, like...
She, like, messaged me or whatever.
Just making sure that it was fine
that you guys hung out, I guess.
Why wouldn't it be?
She's probably just trying to be nice
'cause she knows that we hang out a lot.
Okay, well, you told her
that we're basically like family, right?
We've had our diapers changed together.
You've wiped your boogers on me.
I haven't done that in, like, weeks.
So I'ma need you to calm down.
- Feels like yesterday.
- Well,
I lied and I told her that
you're super cool, so you're welcome.
Anyway, I wrote a song.
Okay. Can I hear it?

Yeah.
Okay. [CHUCKLES]
- What's it called?

You can't judge it.

- Oh, yes. Goodbye, trusty hound.
- [ZACH COUGHS]
- Rob, you're taking her to the groomer.
- You didn't ask me to do that.
Uh, yes, I did. On Tuesday
when I made the appointment.
- I asked you if you were free.
- [ZACH COUGHS]
No, sorry. It's not on the calendar.
I'm gonna take Grace to practice,
and then I'm going straight to work.
Well, I'm taking Zach to his date
and then picking up his meds.
I would take Daisy,
but if I don't hit the road right now,
- I'm not gonna make it to school in time.
- What about Alli?
I can't. I'm waiting on a call from Colin.
- Sam!

I haven't seen him in weeks. The base

I don't like the sound of that cough.
- [ROB] Grace, let's go.
- I'm fine.
The hospital's on the way to the park.
We'll just pop in and make sure.
No, Mom. Seriously, I'm okay.
No. Alli, your call's gonna have to wait.
I need you to take Daisy.
- But Mom...
- Alli.
Sorry, kiddo.
- Come on.
- Can we just go after the picnic?
- No. Absolutely not. No!
- Please, please, please?
- We're not having an argument about this.
- It's not that serious.
- I'm fine. I'm seriously okay.
- We're going to the hospital. Stop!
[SIGHS] All right.
[WOMAN] Drop it at the post office.
[COUGHING]
[DOCTOR] Okay, the scan shows
Zach has got a collapsed lung.
But luckily, the pediatric surgeon has
been able to move some things around,
and we can get you in right now.
Now? Can't we wait until later?
It can't be that big of a deal.
I feel fine.
Your lung is leaking air
and putting pressure on your heart.
If we don't relieve it right away,
you could go into respiratory failure
- or cardiac arrest.
- Mom?
Okay, babe, it's gonna be okay.

[ROB] But you said the surgery
was successful.
[DOCTOR] We were able to fix the collapse,
but I'm sorry.
They show that the cancer
has reached Zach's lungs.
[LAURA] I don't understand.
We were just given the all clear.
[DOCTOR] As you know, osteosarcoma is
very unpredictable and very resilient.
- [ROB] Then let's do another treatment.
- [LAURA] Yeah.
[DOCTOR] I'm afraid Zach's cancer
no longer responds to treatment.
[LAURA] Wait, what are you saying?
[DOCTOR] Zach is terminal.
[ZACH] How long?
[LAURA] Oh, my God. Hey, babe.
[ZACH] How long?
Every case is different.
There's no way to really know.
Will I make it to graduation?
[DOCTOR] If graduation is end of spring...
It's hard to say.
We're giving it six to ten months.
I am so sorry.

Ooh. Tess, I'm digging the new color.

What's going on, playboy?
It's good to be back, old man.
- Just hope there isn't a pop quiz.
- Well, guess what?
There might be a pop quiz 'cause
you called me "old man." Have a seat.
All right. And for your information,
I'm middle-aged. Big difference.
All right, everybody,
put those phones down.
Let me holla at y'all real quick.
I know when you woke up this morning
you wasn't sure what today was gonna be.
But guess what? It's a special day.
Today is the day
we craft your college essays.
Yay! [LAUGHS]
Now look, I'm not trying
to put no pressure on you at all.
I'm lying. It's a lot of pressure.
I mean, these essays can determine the
whole trajectory of your life. [LAUGHS]
And I'ma help you with that.
Mr. Weaver's gonna help you write
some of the best essays in the state.
My classroom. Nobody else gonna care
but us, but it'll be a big deal to me.
So I came up with three questions to help
you write the perfect college essay.
Question number one: What
do you hope to accomplish in college?
What do you wanna do once you get there?
Do you actually wanna go there to learn,
or do you wanna just go there
and play around?
Beer pong, physics? Think about that.
Number two:
What special attributes do you have
that should qualify you for consideration?
Why should a university accept you?
What do you have to offer?
And not even just to a university,
to the world?
What are your best attributes?
And finally, the last question,
and it comes from
one of my favorite poets, Mary Oliver.
What do you wanna do with your one,
wild and precious life?
Mary Oliver,
one of the greats to ever do it.
Think about that.
You got one life to live.
What are you gonna do with it?
Now get to it.

In Mr. Weaver's class, we were supposed
to write a... a college essay.
Mm-hmm.
I mean...
what's the point
of writing a college essay
when I'm never even
going to make it to college?
What's the point of anything now?
Hon, what you're facing...
knowing that your time is limited,
it is... scary.
And awful, and I hate it.
I've been thinking lately that none of us
are really promised tomorrow.
We all just assume it's gonna be there.
Maybe it's kinda like a painting.
When you're standing too close to it...
you can see dark bits,
and you can see light bits, but...
you don't really know what you're
looking at until you take a step back.
So maybe, as much as this sucks...
maybe this is some
kind of weird chance for you.
To forget about all the superficial stuff
that people waste their time on.
You get to decide what matters most now.
You get to choose
what your painting's gonna look like.

Catherine Latapie was the first person
to be miraculously cured at Lourdes.
She was healed of paralysis in 1858.
Physical miracles
are an extraordinary phenomenon.
But many other pilgrims
make their way to Lourdes
for moral healing or spiritual comfort.
Less spectacular miracles, perhaps,
but nevertheless,
important for those Catholics...
[ROB SIGHS, GROANS]
What's that?
Oh, it's...
- Where were you?
- Work. Just trying to catch up.
What are you watching?
I was thinking our family
could really use a vacation.
Vacation? Now?
When else?
Zach's always wanted to see the world.
There's...
There's a place in France, Lourdes.
People say the water
can be really healing.
- That it's been curing people...
- Water, really?
He had 24 rounds of chemo.
Yeah, I think I know how many rounds
of chemo he's had.
Well, then you know how much
disappointment he's already had,
- and taking him and dragging him...
- We've all been disappointed.
That doesn't mean
we just give up on our son.
[WHISPERING]
I'm not giving up on our son. Okay?

in quality time with the Moulin Rouge.
Dude, that was supposed to be a secret.
You're kidding, right?
- So does that mean we can't go, or...
- Come on, Grace.
Are you sure we can't take Daisy?
Honey, I promise the Schimnowskis
will take good care of her.
I just feel bad that we're going
to be having fun without her.
Geez, Grace, Daisy can have more fun
shredding a roll of toilet paper
than anyone's ever had in France.
Hey, you leaving without saying bye?
Amy, what? Uh, hi.
Hey, Zach. Your hair looks good.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's surprising how fast it grows
when chemicals aren't being pumped
into your body.
Here's the thing. I like you.
And I know your diagnosis
complicates things, but I can't help it.
I don't care. So, um...
- Amy, I don't think...
- Do you like me?
- Yes, I do, but...
- Even though I don't have cancer?
- Come on, Zeke.
- Make your move, Romeo.
- Be nice.
- Sam!
Maybe we should just kiss?

Oh, no, the people do not want that.

How about you just text me

Zachary David Sobiech,
I've only waited eight years
for you to ask me that question!
Oh, okay. Yes. Calm down.
It's not that serious.
It's not like I'm asking you
to prom or anything.
Well, good, 'cause I don't wanna
limit my options too soon.
You never know. Tom Hanks might walk
right through that door in a white tux
looking for someone to eat baby corn with.
Just how many times
have you watched Big now?
Still not enough.
Anyway, Amy told me that she was hoping
that you would ask her to prom.
- Crap.
- What? I thought you liked her.
Yeah, I do, but prom proposals
are such a huge deal.
First of all,
it's called a promposal, okay?
Second of all,
if you ask her, she's gonna say yes.
I just want it to be memorable.
Jason Mraz.
What about him?
Well, I might've gotten tickets
to his show at the Metro.
- But, like, maybe...
- What are you talking about?
Maybe instead of taking me,
you take Amy and ask her to prom there.
- Well, can't we get an extra ticket?
- For who?
For you, dummy.
There's no way I'm going
to see Jason Mraz without you.
That's just not gonna happen.
I don't think you want a third wheel
around for your big promposal.
Stop saying that word. They are
two separate words. Prom and proposal.
And you're not a wheel,
you're like a wing.
- And Amy's becoming like my other wing.

Yeah, I know. Couldn't sleep.
- You wanna make an album?
- Like a real one?
Yeah. Why not see if people
actually wanna listen to our music?
I was thinking
we can make music videos too.
- Put them up on YouTube, right?
- Yeah.
Right, Governor Bear?
Oh, yes, Zachary David Sobiech.
Right you are.

- Give him back.
No. Zach, stop!

I wasn't trying to get you to confess

- It's just...
- It's fine.
I guess I just thought that we'd...
I don't know, like,
have our first loves, and...
go off to college, and then
there'd be boyfriends and girlfriends.
But then maybe one day when we're older...
we'd, like...
find our way back.
Realize it was us all along.
You know, I've thought about it too.
You know, if...
we were normal,

But...
We're not normal.
No, we're not.

[MALE ANNOUNCER] In today's video, we're

It does zero to 60 miles an hour
in 2.9 seconds.
- [KNOCKING]
- It is aggressive. It's exhilarating.
It's scary...
[DOOR OPENS]
Hey.
Is for horses.
I've always wanted a horse.
I never have, but if you want one,
you shall have one, my dear.
[CHUCKLES]
Oh, I missed you today at school.
[SIGHS]
[EXHALES]
- What should we name it?
- What?
Our horse.
Um... how about Felicity?
[ZACH] Mm.
I was thinking Roger.
[LAUGHS]
- A horse named Roger?
- Yeah.
And that way,
we can name our daughter Felicity.
Our daughter, huh?
Our first daughter.
How many daughters are we having?
At least three, and then three boys.
I always liked how even my family is.
Six kids is a pretty tall order.
I wonder when we should start trying.
Amy Adamle...
I would marry you today, if I could.
It's not fair.
I love you.
You do?
I do.
I do.
Z?
[PHONE RINGS]
[LAURA] Hello?
Yes, I'm his mom.
- How can I help you?
- Yeah, you got it.
What? How?
Good morning.
Good morning.
[ALLI] Wow, you are so grounded.
- [LAURA] That could work.
- We fell asleep.
Yeah, right.
I need to think about it.
Can I call you back?
You too.
Uh, Mom, did you know
that Amy spent the night?
It wasn't on purpose.
I'm just gonna head home.
My mom keeps on calling me anyways, so...
All right. Thanks a lot, Alli.
All right.
I'll see you. Bye.
Geez. What is the big deal?
We were tired. We cuddled.
"Cuddled"?
Zach, Colin always stays in the basement
whenever he's in town.
Yeah, maybe Colin's
less of a gentleman than I am.
I think you mean more.
[LAURA] Zach.
- Mom, I'm sorry...
- Have you looked on YouTube?
- What?
- Look at that. Look at it.
- You have 20,000 views?
- No way.
- Seriously? For... For what?
- Sammy... Sammy posted our video.
I just talked to a journalist
who said she saw your video
- and she wants to interview you.
- Why?
Must be a slow news day.
- Shut up.
- [BOTH LAUGH]
Does she know about the cancer?
She'd like to make it part of the story,
which we can talk about.
[ZACH] I dunno. I just...
I don't wanna be some kind of sob story.
[SAMMY] Nobody sees you like that,
and if they did, I would tell you.
Yeah, but if this interview does happen
that is what people will think.
If you don't wanna do the interview,
you don't really have to.
Without doing anything,
the video's already up to...
- Holy Toledo.
- How much?
Fifty-one thousand.
Are you serious? What are people saying?
"They harmonize so well together.
More songs please. Are they dating?"
That was timely.
The Internet's so weird sometimes.
- What does that one say?
- That one doesn't say anything.
- Show me.
- No, it's... It's kind of a dumb one.
"You're not so special.
Lots of kids have cancer."
Yeah. That guy's obviously
a very sad, lonely jerk.
But you don't know that. He could be
a very happy and popular jerk,
like that guy from Grease.
♪ You're not so special
Lots of kids have cancer ♪
[SCATTING]
You don't always have to do that.
Do what?
You know, try to make something funny
when it's not.
No? Tough crowd.
Zach.
How's this for not funny? He's right.
- There's nothing special about me.
- That's not true. You should be happy.
- This is a good thing.
- Why? Because we have 51,000 views?
- Who cares?
- Because this is just the beginning.
And what's the end?
I thought this is what you wanted.
What I wanted was to make an album,
and then go on tour and then write
more songs and make another album.
But it doesn't really matter what I want,
because it's not gonna happen, is it?
Is this what you wanted?
I mean, come on.
What I want is to not have
to lose my best friend.
[EXHALES]
It's cool people like the video.
[SCHOOL BELL RINGS]
You go, okay? I'll catch up.
Just gonna sit here
and bask in my newfound success.
[EXHALES]
[SAMMY CRYING]
[AMY] Sammy?
Are you okay?
The honest answer is...
not even a little.
Do you wanna talk about it?
[DISTANT CHATTERING]
[EXHALES]
So what are we looking at?
Don't you have class?
Yeah, I do.
I mean, I'm a teacher. [CHUCKLES]
But you know something? Screw that class.
They can teach themselves.
This is comfortable.
How are you?
I mean, I don't know
if I've said this to you, but you...
You look amazing
with this head full of hair.
Like, for real. You look like a model.
[LAUGHING]
Even though I miss you
without eyebrows, though.
There's something
about you just having an alien face.
You know, no eyebrows.
Nobody could see your expressions.
They don't know if you're surprised,
or, "Is he happy?"
- Do we know if...
- It's a pretty good poker face, right?
It's a great poker face.
You should play in a bunch of
poker tournaments, without eyebrows.
They should do a poker tournament
where everybody don't have no eyebrows.
- That would be crazy.
- [CHUCKLES]
That would be the longest game
of poker ever. [LAUGHS]
I'm off chemo.
Is it because it worked, or...
Or.
You said "or," right?
Or.
You know you don't have
to keep coming here, right?
Um...
Like, if you're not happy coming
to school and being around all of this.
You want me to quit?
[EXHALES]
You know something? No.
[GRUNTS] Come here.
Yeah. That's right.
I'm not saying you need to quit.
Quitting is not an option, no.
I'm just saying you need to re-prioritize.
Look here, man.
Look, you got something in there, right?
You got so much in there
that the world needs to hear.
Now do me a favor.
You go show Mary Oliver what's up.
[LAURA] That's good.
Does everybody have enough?
- [ALLI] It's really good, Mom.
- Thanks, honey.
Ooh. Sour cream noodle bake?
What's the occasion?
Sorry if yours is a bit cold.
It's been sitting there for a while.
Zach, you want some broccoli?
- I'm okay.
- Hi.
[SIGHS]
Oh, the cheese is perfect on this.
Look at that. Look at that.
Can you not look at me like that?
Like what?
Like your every happiness rests on me
eating all the casserole.
Like if I do, everything will be fine.
News flash, everything is not fine.
Zach.
- Get up.
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- I'm in a weird mood. I didn't mean it.
- I was gonna wait till tomorrow,
but I think you need this tonight.
Come on.
Need what?
Dad, come on. I'm sorry.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Where are they going?
It's a surprise.
I don't like surprises.
- No way. No way!
- [LAUGHS]
No, no, no, no, no.
What? Are you kidding me right now?
Is this really happening?
Oh, my...
This is insane. Did I just, like...
die and go to heaven?
- Uh, that is not funny.
- I'm not trying to be funny.
I'm trying to wrap my head around the fact
that there is a GT-R
sitting in our driveway right now, Alli.
- You like it?
- Do I like it?
Are we, like, rich and didn't know it?
- No, we are not rich.
- Don't worry. I didn't buy it.
I borrowed it from Mike,
from the dealership.
He cleared it so we could drive it
for a week.
So you could drive it for a week.
Just don't scratch it, okay?
No way. Thank you so much.
[ZACH GRUNTS]
- This is so cool. Thank you.
- Yeah.
Can we take it for a spin?
Can you wait till the morning,
or at least grab a coat?
- Please.
- It's a performance car with a heater.
Besides, I need a ride.
I have something I really need to do.
Can I go next?
No, honey. Not now, all right?
No way! Oh my, gosh. This is so cool.

You didn't think about me.
This is about you now? Are y...
Yes. You know what? It is about me.
And it's about you,
and it's about the fact that you haven't
said one word to me in months

- Yes. KS95. KS95.
Do you have a radio?
Just change it to KS95, please.
I can do it. No. You got it?
[SONG PLAYS THROUGH SPEAKERS]

I'm on the radio! I'm on the radio!

Oh, my gosh. We're on the radio.

[TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]
- Hello, relatives.
- [ROB] Hi.
[GRACE] Hey.
Well, well, well. What have we here?
I see you got a new jersey.
- Yeah.
- It's a pretty interesting number choice.
- Shh.
- That's actually my number.
So what?
Weird coincidence. Grace, are you trying
to tell me that I'm your inspiration?
It's just a number.
- You can just come right out and say it.
- [PHONE RINGING]
- Alli, phone.
- [ZACH] You can just tell me.
- I'm just gonna pause the movie.
- [ZACH] You, starts with an "I",
- ends with an "ove."
- Hello?
- [GRACE] Love this movie.
- Put 'em together.
Yes, I do. So, how about
you be quiet and we watch it?
- Or you can just admit that I'm your idol.
- [ALLI] Zach. Zach.
It's for you.
- [WHISPERING] It's the Metropolitan.
- [GRACE] It's the Metro?
- Wait, what?
- Why are they calling you?
I don't know.
Hello?
Yeah, this is Zach.
- Wait, what?
- The Metro, Metro? Oh, my gosh!
- [LAUGHS]
- [SAMMY SCREAMING]
- And guess what?
- What?
They also want you to play.
Hello? Sammy, are you alive? Hello?
[CHATTERING]
[GIRL] Are you him?
You know...
♪ Up, up, up
But I will fly a little higher ♪
[ZACH CHUCKLES]
Yeah. That's my...
That's my song. I'm Zach.
- It's my favorite song.
- Oh, yeah?
Are you gonna die?
Uh, yeah. I am.
My cat died, but it's okay.
He's come back as a tree.
Oh.
Janie, hey. Come on. It's time for class.
Amy, look, it's Zach. He's famous.
He is, huh?
So famous my mom dropped me off.
Rock and roll, baby.
Bye, Zach.
- Bye.
- Bye, Janie.
[SIGHS]
- Hey.
- Hey.
I know I don't really have
the right to be asking for any favors...
but I kinda need a ride somewhere.
Um... what are we doing here?
[ZACH PANTING]
I'm apologizing,
and hopefully you're listening.
I couldn't stand
to see you in so much pain...
and knowing that I was the reason.
I just thought
that if I gave you space that...
I know you were trying
to protect me but...
you really hurt me.
I'm so sorry.
[INHALES]
I can be really dumb sometimes.
[CHUCKLES] I love your song.
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, I do.
It's about this girl.
She's all right, I guess.
So, the Metro wants me to play.
What? Well, are you gonna do it?
I can't do it without you.
I need you.
And I know it's selfish
after everything that I put you...
It isn't selfish, you nerd.
And if it were, then I'd be the most
selfish person on the planet because...
[LAUGHS]
I am in love with you...
on, like, an exaggerated level,
Zach Sobiech.
I love you too.
[MAKES PUCKERING SOUND]
[LAUGHS] What are you doing?
[CONTINUES PUCKERING]
[LAUGHS] What?
[HORSE WHINNIES]
It's a baby horse. Come here!
- [AMY LAUGHS]
- His name is Roger.
Hi, Roger.
- Should I go in? I'm going in.
- Hey, you. Yeah. Go for it.
I'm touching it. Hello.
[GASPS] Oh, my gosh.
[THUNDERCLAP]
[GRUNTS]
- Is that better?
- Yeah.
- Comfortable?
- Yes.
Besides the itch on my nose.
Oh, where? Where is it?
Mom, I was kidding.
I can still scratch my own nose.
[CHUCKLES] You brat.
Okay.
Should we just get this over with?
What?
This fun little list the doctor gave us.
We don't have to do that now.
You still have time, hon.
It's not that bad. Come on.
[SIGHS]
[WHISPERING] I don't wanna do this.
I don't wanna say goodbye.
I think goodbyes can wait.
Okay. Good.
[GROANS]
Okay. [SNIFFS]
"How and where do you wanna die?"
Skydiving in Florida.
[LAUGHS]
And if that doesn't work out,
is there a plan B?
Gee, I hadn't really thought
about a plan B.
Mm...
I wanna be alert enough
to say a proper goodbye.
And I don't wanna be in the hospital.
I just feel really disconnected.
Maybe I could just be here.
On the couch.
- So I can play Xbox.
- [CHUCKLING]
Okay. [SNIFFS]
Um...
Organ donations?
Yeah. Whatever they can use.
Have you thought about your funeral?
- We don't have to do this, we can...
- Bagpipes.
What?
I want bagpipes.
Okay.
And no Psalm 23. It's overdone.
I want the gospel about the talents.
That one makes sense to me.
Yeah.
And no suit. I feel like
it would just be too uptight-looking.
Maybe, like...
tie and my vest.
- I like your vest.
- Yeah, me too.
[SNIFFS]
And maybe these.
[LAURA LAUGHS]
I think they really make my eyes pop.
Oh, my word.
Okay. What next?
- Did you shoot any three-pointers?
- [GRACE] Yeah.
[SAMMY] Did you shoot any touchdowns?
- No, I got a hole in one. Yeah.
- A hole in one?
[BOTH LAUGHING]
- [ROB] All right. Here, have some salad.
- He's too tired to come up.
Oh.
Um... do you guys want me to leave?
I can...
What? No, Sammy, course not.
- Water?
- Thanks.
What's... What's going on?
We spoke with the doctor today,
and he thinks...
He's not sure
if Zach's gonna make it to prom.
That's, like, a month away.
I know it's hard to hear.
We wanted to discuss it with you,
uh... [INHALES]
...because we all know how much Zach
has been looking forward to prom.
Right? Especially since
he and Amy got back together,
and we were hoping that maybe we
could find a way to still give him that.
How?
Well, we thought we would
throw him a party.
[LAUGHING]
The best party ever.
Birthday, graduation, prom.
Everything he's ever gonna miss,
all rolled into one.
[CHUCKLES]
What do you think? Sounds good, right?
- I mean, he loves a party. Right?
- Yeah.
What if we did it at the Metro?
It's only a couple weeks away.
- Yeah.
- That's a great idea.
Yeah, maybe you and Amy
could get the whole school to come.
- Yeah.
- We can get the whole town to come.
[CHUCKLES] I could call the radio station,
get them involved.
He'll love that.
- [ALL LAUGHING]
- He will love it.
- [LAURA] Everyone's coming. Okay?
- He'll like that.
He's gonna love it.
- Great. Pass the potatoes?
- [ALLI] Yeah.
[LAURA] Thank you, honey. Okay.
Okay, great. So we'll see you there?
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.
["AMES" BY A FIRM HANDSHAKE PLAYING]
Michelle? Hi. Laura Sobiech.
Yeah, I wanted to let you know
we're having a celebration for Zach...
[SAMMY] Hi.
Okay, this is for you.
I think this one is yours.
You got this.
We're gonna learn this tonight.
Thank you guys so much for coming.
How did you do that many? I don't...
- Are you struggling?
- Yeah, a little bit.
Sorry. Sorry, guys.
Can we start from the top one more time?
[SONG CONTINUES]
Shh.
Uh, they wanna know
if we need to cancel the show tonight.
[SONG FADES]
We have two hours.
I'll let Sam know.
He should be on his way.
Zach is a fighter.
But his body is shutting down.
Could be days, or sooner.
At this point, it's hard to tell.
The best thing we can do
for Zach right now
is to make sure he's comfortable.
Okay. [CRIES]
- Thank you.
- You call me if you need me.
[ROB] Thank you. Thank you.
[LAURA CRIES]
- It's not fair.
- I know it isn't.
All right, I'm gonna call Sammy
'cause she needs to go on without him.
Okay.
[SOBS]
I gotta let Amy know.
Okay, love.
[GRACE SOBBING]
Oh, Grace.
[LAURA EXHALES]
Have you gone down to see him?
I can't.
We don't know
how much time he has left, sweetheart.
- Mom, I can't.
- You can. You know what?
- Just you go sit with him.
- Please don't make me.
You don't have to say anything.
You just go sit with him.
It will be okay. Okay?
Go on. Go on, honey.
It's okay. Go on, honey. It's okay.
[LABORED BREATHING]
Hey, dork.
[SOBBING]
What am I gonna do without you?

Watch whatever you want.
[LABORED BREATHING]
[TV PLAYS QUIETLY]
[LABORED BREATHING CONTINUES]
I love you.
Hey.
Hey.
He made us promise we'd still go.
Thank you for staying with him.
[TV PLAYS QUIETLY]
[ZACH] Hey.
Help me with my tie?
Zach.
What are you...
- Zach, you're...
- [LABORED BREATHING]
You're supposed to be in bed.
What are you...
You're going to get your prom, Amy Adamle.
Are you sure? I don't need a prom.
We're going.
[CHATTERING]
Zach! Good luck, my man.
You're gonna crush it tonight!
Hurry up!
This is all you.
Okay, it's cold. [CHUCKLES]
This time it's your name in the lights.
- You ready?
- Yeah.
- [STAGEHAND] Have a great show.
- Thanks so much.
[MAN] Kick ass, Zach.
[STAGEHAND]
Okay. Yeah, we got Zach stage right.
[CROWD CHATTERING]
[EXHALES]
[SAMMY] Hey, gimpy.
- You made it.
- Yeah. I made it.
Right. Just don't screw it up.
[CROWD CHEERING, CLAPPING]
[MR. WEAVER] Yes. Yes.
Yes, yes.
Well, first of all,
I'd like to welcome you
to the Zach Sobiech Osteosarcoma Fund
Prom Party and Concert!
[CHEERING]
That's right.
This is the party of all parties!
This beautiful and amazing occasion
reminds me of a quote
from the great Sadie Delany which says,
"Life is short,
and it's up to you to make it sweet."
And, honestly,
I don't think anything is sweeter
than seeing all you guys come together
for Zach. Yeah.
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
Now, without further ado,
coming to the stage
is the other half of A Firm Handshake.
Give it up for Sammy Brown, everybody.
Sammy Brown!
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]
Wish me luck.
Go get 'em.
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE CONTINUES]
Um...
Thank you, Milton.
[CROWD] Ooh!
[MAN IN AUDIENCE] Don't take that, Weaver!
So, um,
Zach's family asked me to sing a song,
and this one's called,
"How to Go to Confession."
Wrote it for a friend.

Never in my wildest dreams

how I'll be remembered after all this.
And for a long time,
I thought that I'd be remembered

looking at all of you...
I know I'm gonna be remembered

[BAGPIPES PLAYING "AMAZING GRACE"]
[SIGHS]
[ZACH'S VOICE] Wanna know a little secret?
Most teenagers out there
feel like they're invincible.
Not the Superman kind of invincible.
The kind of invincible
that tricks you into thinking tomorrow
might be a better day
to start chasing your dreams.
Now, look, I know it probably seems weird
for me to write a college essay
when, most likely, I won't make it there.
But I wasn't about to let a little thing
like cancer earn me my first F.
So, if by some miracle
I get the chance to go to college,
I will coax every ounce
of experience I can out of it.
But if I don't, that's okay too.
[MOUTHS] Rob.
Because I plan to get as far as I can
with my limited time.
See, we all have limited time.
So, what is it I plan to do
with my one wild and precious life?
It's really simple, actually.
I just wanna make people happy.
As much as I can, for as long as I can.
And in the end, I hope my story
helps everyone to realize...
that you don't have to
find out you're dying...
to start living.
