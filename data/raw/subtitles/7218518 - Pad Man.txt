America has Superman...
Batman...
Spider-man...
But India has...
Pad Man!
Superhero, superhero, superhero...
Superhero, superhero, superhero...
You thinking... I mad...
But mad only becoming famous!
No shooting bang bang
No dramatic entry
No breaking bones
Big man, strong man...
not making country strong
No jumping from high-rise buildings
No fancy dialogues
No cool dance moves
Woman strong, mother strong...
sister strong...
then country strong!
Who gives such a thing to sister?
No one does...but everyone must!
I made a promise to protect you...
I am keeping my promise!
We women...
would rather die of illness 
than live in shame!
Hold on to your shame 
and drown in diseases!
Why is Pad Man not flying high?
Salute Pad Man!
He is a mad mad mad...
Pad Man!
I not study IIT...
but IIT study me!
