'No matter how troublesome
a marriage is...'
'It's still called "holy matrimony".'
'Everyone has his or her own
reason to get married.'
'Some get married to make
their mother get some rest.'
'But it's the daughters-in-law who rests.'
'Some get married for entertainment.'
'And then, there are some who don't
even want to walk on its path...'
'But marriage finds a way
to cross their path.'
'One such person is Kumar Shivram Kishan.'
'Don't mistake him to be single
just because he is smiling.'
'He too is married.'
'Not once but thrice.'
'All of them happened without his consent.'
'This happened around a year ago.'
'So, let's have a look
at the first accident.'
Are you okay?
I am fine.
My father is in the hospital.
He is very serious.
I was taking these medicines for him.
Can you please help me?
No problem.
Don't worry. Come with me.
Your daughter is here.
We've brought your medicines, uncle.
Now, you will get well soon.
Now I'll have no regrets even
if something happens to me.
I had just one concern.
That before I die, I should
give my daughter's hand..
..into a suitable boy's hand.
Any way..
Yes?
Take care of her.
What?
Hello? Uncle?
Brother? Hello?
Uncle?
Now he won't say anything.
He can at least hear me, right?
Hello? Uncle?
I am sorry. He is no more.
How can he just die?
He was alive a minute ago.
Papa!
Papa!
Papa, no!
He was a fortunate one, to die after
getting his daughter settled.
Settled? Who got settled?
Yes, son.
You have fulfilled a dying man's wish.
I didn't do anything.
Look, he left with a smile.
You are a great soul, son.
Here's your wedding gift.
Come on, everyone. Give him your gifts.
'As wedding gifts, he got...'
'Rs. 45, 2 bananas, 2 oranges, a few
change and a bottle of saline.'
'THERE'S A SAYING: Once bitten twice shy.'
'But when your time is bad, you
end up biting your own self.'
'Shivram Kishan also loves to..'
'..bite into ice creams
served at the weddings.'
'He went to his friend Ballu's wedding.'
How much does she give in year?
What?
I mean how many marriages
does she attend in a season?
Sir, she is a very lucky mare.
The one who touches her gets married.
Her name is "the runaway mare".
No. I don't want to get married. My
friend Ballu is getting married.
Okay. No problem.
He always said that he will
settle down in Canada.
But he didn't have the money.
Then I advised him to get
married and settle down here...
Close to his own people.
And look, he is getting is married today.
Kumar!
What happened, Jojo?
- There is a big problem.
- What happened?
Ballu was drinking and driving.
Police arrested him.
So, what do we do now?
Now only you can help me from defamation.
Wear this and get on the mare.
But how can I take Ballu's place?
I am not asking you to get married.
It's just for a while.
I'll get him released on bail by the
time you guys reach the bride's house.
Please. Please, I beg of you.
You don't need to do that, but..
Please. Please.
Be there on time.
I will go like this...
and I will keep going.
Go slow. Are you the one getting married?
- What's the hurry?
- No problem. We will go slowly.
Hello?
We have reached the bride's house.
When are you coming?
We are just leaving the police station.
- Hurry up.
- Okay.
Ballu, have you switched
off your mobile phone?
- Yes, brother.
- Come on, get in. Hurry up.
To the airport.
It's time for the wedding vows.
Get the bride.
I'll get her right away.
Oh God, they are getting
ready for the vows.
Why is his phone switched off?
Sir, start walking around the fire.
Hold on, can I just talk
to you for a second?
Hurry up.
Look, we cannot get married.
Why?
Look at me.
Aren't you surprised?
Why would I be surprised?
Because I am not Ballu.
I know. You are Ballu's friend.
Right. You were supposed to be
getting married to Ballu, right?
Ballu had shown me your photo.
I liked you as soon as I saw your photo.
Ballu showed you my photo?
Yes.
And we are the ones who sent the Rs.
50 lakhs needed for your business.
- 50 lakhs?
- Yes.
Ballu!
So he's off to Canada.
Look, I have been deceived.
I cannot get married to you.
What are you saying?
All the guests are here.
Then find a suitable one among
the guests and get married.
But I cannot get married to you.
Look, I have already been
through one tragedy.
I am the one who has
gone through an tragedy.
I am a model.
While walking on the ramp
accidentally all my clothes came off.
Because of that I have
face a lot of humiliation.
My marriage has already
been called off thrice.
Please don't say that.
If you don't marry me, I will jump
into this fire and kill myself.
Look, I can understand your problem.
But you too should try to
understand my problem.
- You cannot marry me.
- No, I can't.
But I can kill myself.
Hey! Hello!
'Do something good and get
something bad in return.'
'This is what has been
happening in Shivram's life.'
'But in spite of that he didn't change.'
'So far he would personally
come forward to help others.'
'This time someone came
to him to seek his help.'
'What could the poor guy do?'
Help!
Help! Please help me.
Those goons are after me.
How can they be after you?
There is something called as
law and order in this city.
Let's go and handle them.
There are 10-15 of them. - 10-15!
Hop on. Hurry up.
- Let's follow them.
- Yes.
Hello?
Hello, Anil? I ran away from my wedding.
Who asked you to run away?
They were getting me
married to someone else.
It doesn't matter to me
where you get married.
What are you saying, Anil?
You said you love me.
That was before I knew that
you were a don's sister.
So please, it's over.
Anil! Anil, please don't do that.
Where will I go, if you don't support me?
Just go to hell.
Hello?
Hello.
Anil...
Look, I don't know who you are.
But please, don't cry.
Everything happens for a reason.
Hey, hello.
Where are you going?
What are you doing? Have
you lost your mind?
- Get down.
- Just leave me.
- Get down.
- Let me die.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Then what should I do?
You want to die because a guy left you?
You have just one reason to die?
But have you ever thought how many
reasons you can have to stay alive?
You can live for the one
who is made only for you.
The one you cannot tolerate
a single tear in your eyes.
The one who never let go of your hand.
Come, let me take you home.
Let's go.
Now how will I face everyone?
My brother... he will kill me.
He is your brother, not an executioner.
I will talk to him.
- Tiger-bhai.
- Brother.
- He is your brother?
- Yes.
'That's Tiger-bhai, the
infamous don of this city.'
'Everyone fears him.'
'He hates only one thing, dowry.'
'He seeks double from
those who seek dowry.'
Let go of my hand, please.
You made your brother see this day?
Let's go home.
Everyone in this city gets
scared of me and runs away.
But when you ran away, I got scared.
Stupid, how can my anger ever be
more important than your happiness?
I will do whatever you say.
Yes, sir. That's what I was telling her.
A brother will never wish
bad or evil for his sister.
But you are a don, and also her brother...
Anjali, you don't need to run
away with the boy you like.
You should rather settle down with him.
Yes.
I like this boy.
What?
Tiger-bhai!
Tiger-bhai!
Move aside! I want to talk to him.
He doesn't listen to anyone.
But he will have to listen to me,
otherwise I will be in trouble.
Tiger-bhai is deaf. How
will he listen to him?
Tiger-bhai!
Look...
I am not the boy for whom your
sister ran away from her wedding.
Look, I was on the road and
your sister was running.
And your goons... your staff was after her.
So I thought I should save her from them.
I saved her from committing suicide.
Please forgive me, sir. I am a married man.
Why are you folding your hands like this?
I will hold my hands while
sending off my sister.
Sir, you don't understand.
I already have two wives.
Yes, we will get you married right here.
Like you, I too am in a hurry.
Look, you are misunderstanding me.
I have nothing to do with your sister.
You won't take dowry?
That's so nice of you. I too
am completely against dowry.
But remember one thing, my
sister shouldn't lack anything.
Because here, there are plenty
of guns but only one sister.
Priest, you may begin.
'This is how tragically Kumar
Shivram got married thrice.'
'His wives brought him good luck.'
'Now he has money and is also the
CEO of the Provogue company.'
'What he doesn't have is peace of mind.'
He always come to me to find that.
Look carefully at this man!
This man who looks innocent,
is married to three women.
Out of the fear that his wives don't
meet each other accidentally...
He has kept one in Borivali, one
in Andheri and one in Bandra.
He has also told them that he spends
one night at home and two on duty.
So that he can spend a
day with each of them.
Out of the fear of getting caught he
has saved his wives numbers as....
Head office, Branch office and Area office.
In the disguise of three offices,
he runs three household...
And yet, he roams around
in a carefree manner.
With cameraman Karan, it's me, myself.
Are you done with your shooting?
I was just joking.
My life is in a mess and you are joking.
All my three wives say that it's okay
if I spend two nights in my office...
But I should wish them good
morning before I go to office.
I should say bye to them.
All three of them want a good morning kiss.
Now for one kiss I have
to travel 30 kilometers.
I am more like a local train now.
I don't know who all should I love.
How do I love them?
If this is creating so
much problem for you...
Why don't you keep them at one place?
At one place?
Who made you a lawyer, you dimwit?
If they even got a hint of
each other's existence...
They will either kill me or themselves.
I am not asking you to keep
them in the same house.
Keep them in the same building.
Keep them on different floors.
So they won't find out about each
other if they are on separate floors?
Do you know Jatin Matre?
No. Why does he too have three wives?
No. He is not that ill-fated.
He just has one wife.
He stays in your Bandra
building, on the same floor.
- Really?
- Yes.
When you don't know who stays on
your floor, in your building...
Then how will your wives find out
about who stays in the other floors?
It's not a bad idea.
But it is not easy to get three
flats in the same building.
My love, this is Mumbai.
Everything is possible here.
Look over there. Cocktail Tower.
It's a new building. Forget three,
you will get ten flats in it.
The one who made you a
lawyer did the right thing.
Three wives on different
floors in the same building.
And you on the top floor.
Me? Why?
I will use you as an excuse
to meet the three of them.
No one will get suspicious.
I am anyway not getting any case
and you are making me spend more?
I will bear the expenses,
why are you cribbing?
- But..
- Welcome to Cocktail Tower.
Welcome to Cocktail Tower, my love.
But I don't want to stay there!
'Shivram Kishan took my advice..
..and brought three flats
in Cocktail Tower.'
'Now let's see how peaceful is his life.'
Two wives serve me and this
one make me serve her.
Anyway, whatever God wills.
Simran, I am getting late.
You take more time to bathe
once than I take in a year.
You will wither one day.
The tea is also...
What will you have?
Hot tea... or me?
Sweetie, you make it difficult
for me to go to office.
Then why do you leave me and go?
Come on, Shiv. At least
be a little romantic.
A little everywhere becomes a lot for me.
What?
I mean, you give me a lot
of love, little by little.
Now what do I tell you.
No, I will show you. It's just a trailer.
Bai (MAID).
Say bye when I let you go.
Our maid.
Behind you.
Champa, can't you knock before entering?
Can't you lock the door?
First dust the bedroom.
No, I will go the kitchen first.
The bedroom takes a lot of time.
It's always very dirty.
Sorry, it fell.
Anyway it was old.
Let it be, sweetie.
I don't think Champa is
in a good mood today.
Some other time.
Anyway, you are always in the mood.
I'll go meet Karan and then leave.
Okay? Bye.
Okay. Bye.
Rude!
"Rude!"
6th floor.
Hi.
What is this, sweetheart? You
are always playing video games.
Then what else should I do?
You don't have time for me.
You have brought such a
big house for only me?
Of course, sweetheart.
It's for both of us.
We are together only for one night.
You are on duty for the other two nights.
I am on duty only for namesake.
Actually, I am with my wife.
What?
I mean, I am always thinking about you.
Ram...
Don't you think there should
be a child in this house?
Whose child will we get?
Not someone else's child.
- I am talking about our child.
- Okay.
I really wish to play with the kids.
You are a grown up. Why do
you want to play with kids?
You don't understand anything.
Let it be.
I rather meet the ladies in
this society and spend my time.
Have you lost your mind? You will
meet the ladies of this society?
Here no one meets anyone.
No one disturbs anyone.
That's why I have come here.
You know what happened in that building?
A woman came to sell soaps.
She hit her on the head with a
stick and stole all the jewelry.
You better stay away from the women.
Actually, I don't want
anyone to come between us.
You are so possessive about me.
That I am, baby.
- I love you.
- I love you too.
Can I go now?
No.
Okay then, I'll get going.
No.
Okay then, I'll get going now.
Fine, go.
- Okay, baby. Bye.
- Bye.
Let's rock on 4th floor.
Yes!
Simran! Anjali! Juhi!
Good morning, darling.
You are late. I have been waiting for you.
Can't help it, darling.
First the head office, then the branch
office and now the area office.
Area office?
I will go after I meet you.
You work so hard.
And still you take such good care of me.
I pray everyone gets a husband like you.
How sweet.
Look what I have here.
Wow. Sweet porridge, fried bread
with chickpeas. My favorite.
Where did you order from?
I haven't ordered it from a hotel.
I made it.
- You?
- Then what!
We don't have a maid.
Don't worry, darling. I will
get a nice maid for you.
But the way, what's the occasion?
You forgot? It will be a year today.
Oh God, how can I forgot!
It's been a year since we got married.
Happy anniversary, darling.
No. I haven't made it for our anniversary.
- It's for papa's death anniversary.
- Oh.
He too had left this world on this day.
Yes, there is not much difference in
his death anniversary and my marriage.
He departed and I got stuck.
What?
He was a nice man. I am missing him.
Wait. First feed papa.
- Papa?
- Yes, I have hanged his photo.
Look, over there.
Oh.
How is it?
Very nice.
It looks like he is laughing at me.
Should I go feed him?
Yes. I'll go and get water.
You are laughing and displaying
your 8 inch long teeth.
If you would've waited for another
five minutes on that day...
I would've escaped this fate.
But you kept her hand in mine and exited.
You didn't give your daughter
to me, you made my life...
Now what do I tell you?
You messed up my life and now you
want to have these delicacies?
Right, old man?
"Right, old man?"
Cute old man.
Such old man are hard
to find in the market.
Again old man?
Papa, darling.
Do one thing, feed papa.
I am leaving. Okay?
But at least eat some from his plate.
I'll eat it in the evening, darling.
I already have too much in my plate,
and she wants me to eat that.
Don't be so surprised.
Apart from these forced wives, Shivram
Kishan also has a girlfriend.
'Deepika. She is very religious.'
Do you have any idea how much I missed you?
You missed me, huh?
I came back from London after a year...
And you didn't even come to
receive me at the airport.
Deepu, now what do I tell you?
Work always keeps me busy.
You know I opened three
offices in the past one year.
Wow, Kumar! That's great news.
Dad too will be very pleased.
No, I cannot show my offices to your dad.
- What do you mean?
- Your dad is such big businessman.
My three offices are nothing
when compared to his.
I want you to have ten
offices, instead of three.
For God's sake. Please, don't say that.
Why?
Then how will I spend time with you, Deepu?
I don't just need your time.
I need your companionship for a lifetime.
You know, God have already given a
lot, without even asking for it.
But if there is anything I
have asked God for myself...
It's you.
I love you, Kumar.
When are you going to meet my dad?
I will meet your dad. I will
meet him anytime you want.
Not anytime, today, right now.
Do one thing. First show your
dad a good photo of mine.
If he rejects my photo, I'll go
meet him to get myself selected.
Baby, the thing is, it's not nice
to get insulted on the face.
Don't take my father lightly.
He has a very different philosophy of life.
Have you brought your documents?
Yes, sir. Here are my documents.
Your degree is fine. Have you brought
your life partner's photograph?
No, sir. I don't have her photo.
That's what is important.
My boss lives by the principle
that, character comes first.
Here, each staff's desk should contains
his or her life partner's photo.
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.
Go and get your life partner's photo.
Sorry, sir.
Have you brought his photo?
Yes sir, I have.
Okay, you wait. Sir is saying is prayers.
He will send for you.
Uncle... Is dad inside?
Yes. He is praying.
Dad...
Dad, I have to go to my rehearsals.
I am getting late.
I am keeping Kumar's photo on the desk.
If you have time to spare,
you can have a look at it.
Yes, tell...
Hey! She left.
Oh no.
Stop Deepika.
She left, sir.
Oh God.
Sir, candidates are here for the interview.
- Shall I send them in?
- Yes, send them in.
She got angry once again.
May I come in, sir?
- Come in.
- Thank you, sir.
- Good morning, sir.
- Please have a seat.
Thank you, sir.
You had asked me to get my fianc's photo.
So I have...
Sorry, sir.
Here you go, sir.
I am going to get married to him.
What does he do?
He works at a security agency, sir.
Are you sure he is the one you
are going to get married to?
Yes, sir.
Fine. Take this photo and
keep it on your desk.
Yes, sir.
Get this straight, if you change the photo,
you will also have to change your job.
- Remember that.
- No, sir. The photo won't change.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Vicky. I got
the job because of you.
Who is he?
'If you change the photo, you will
also have to change your job.'
'Remember that.'
No. The photo won't change.
Deepu!
Deepu!
Deepu!
Deepu!
Hey sweetie...
Sweetheart...
- Baby!
- Uncle...
Uncle, at this age you are teasing a girl?
Don't you have any shame?
Come here.
She is my daughter.
Sweetie!
How much more will you make me run?
You should have stayed there
for another two minutes.
I was just about to finish my prayer.
Two minutes?
You pray for two hours.
I don't understand what you
ask for all this long.
I ask God for your happiness.
What else can I ask for, dear?
- Oh really?
- Yes.
So, did you have a look at the photograph?
I see God's photograph every day.
Not God, Kumar's photograph.
You didn't have a look at it, did you?
No, I didn't. Sorry, dear.
What will I know from the photograph?
Do one thing, invite him
to our house tomorrow.
We will meet face to face.
- You are sure?
- Sure.
There is a call from the enquiry office.
Now which is this fourth office?
Don't answer it. I'll take it.
You came running as if it's
your girlfriend's call...
And you don't want me to answer it.
This is the problem with you women.
You can think about nothing but love.
Can you do me a favor?
- What?
- Will you remove the clothes?
- Really?
- My clothes. From the wardrobe.
Here's your phone.
Hello?
You take so long to answer your phone.
I was busy with work.
Forget about work.
Dad wants to meet you in the evening.
In the evening? Okay. I will be there.
Okay, bye.
Hey, how can you just say bye.
I gave you such a good news.
Won't you even give me a kiss?
Listen... I...
I won't hang up otherwise.
Give me a kiss.
Who were you kissing on the phone?
I was kissing my phone.
You should kiss it as well. I
have got a very big assignment.
- Really?
- Yes.
This is called black magic.
I got a black dress for you
and you got the assignment.
Anyway, you look very hot in this dress.
Champa, you always come at the wrong time.
You should change your timings.
You should change your timings.
This is the only time that suits me.
Shall I go and wear this black magic?
- Sure.
- Okay.
Champa... come an hour late...
And I will pay you 500 rupees more.
I will give a thousand, if you
finally manage to kiss him.
This maid...
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Look who is here.
- Why is he here?
- What do you mean by why?
When did brother come?
Hello, Tiger-bhai.
Tiger-bhai...
Welcome.
After a long time.
Your face has shrunken.
Have you been running?
No, brother. I just keep going
up and down the stairs so...
You don't need to ask.
You are my brother-in-law.
I will give you whatever you want.
I wasn't asking for anything.
What I was saying was...
I am not going to listen to you.
I am thinking of buying him
Sachin Tendulkar's music album.
But Sachin doesn't sing.
And he too doesn't listen.
Don't fight.
Look what I brought for you two.
Don't you think it's a
little too small for us?
Shut up. It's not for
us, but for our child.
I am the only uncle, but
I have a lot of desires.
Brother too wants to hear a child's
laughter echo in this house.
He wants to hear a child's
laughter echo in this house?
But he never listen to the child's father.
The pickle? It's nice. Home-made.
And he wants to hear the laughter.
- You are always...
- I am joking, sweetheart.
Anjali, get him something to eat.
In the meanwhile, we will talk.
Sure, brother. I will get it right away.
- Have a seat.
- Okay.
Say something.
Should I?
You will be infested with worms.
You made me marry your sister at gunpoint.
You know there is no difference in
you and the old man downstairs.
- He keeps eating delicacies with a smile on his face.
- Yes.
And here, you too are eating
delicacies with a smile on your face.
I am done eating.
Anyway, I am on a diet.
- You are on a diet.
- Yes.
Why are you alive?
So many diseases get launched every year.
- Why don't you get yourself infected with one and die?
- Yes.
You know because of you I have three wives.
Not three, you should
have only two children.
Oh God.
Look, he is feeling shy.
He talks a lot. He's so funny.
Don't you guys tell him that he is deaf?
He knows.
But he doesn't want to show
others that he is deaf.
Okay.
Don't worry.
Happiness will soon knock at your doors.
The One above listens to everyone.
The above does listen, I know.
You don't need to accompany
me, I will manage on my own.
Okay? Bye, Anjali.
Bye, brother.
Since when is he like this,
without a sound system?
Actually once he was cleaning
his ears with his gun...
And by mistake he clicked the trigger.
Doctor managed to save his life,
but he couldn't save his ears.
Why are you crying?
- Oh God.
- Oh shit.
I am so sorry. I ruined your shirt.
- Go and quickly change it.
- Yes.
No. Why? Why change? I will clean it.
- Why not? Come with me.
- I will clean it.
I will get into trouble if I change.
This is looking so nice.
And look, it's matching my dress as well.
True. But how will the one above...?
- The one above?
- God.
How will I face Him, when
He will question me...
I have got such a loving wife
but I don't give her time.
How will I face Him?
- Oh! How sweet!
- Yes, sweet.
Tell me, not just your time, you
have given her your whole life.
Yes.
Let me go. Stop hugging me, Anjali.
- Anjali?
- Geetanjali.
But I heard you say Anjali.
The Geeta stayed inside
and only Anjali came out.
It happens, sometimes.
Well, I was thinking, should we
shop from Geetanjali for you?
Oh...
I thought for the first time you said
a name and that too the wrong one.
See, I made a mistake as
soon as I took a name.
That's why I affectionately call
you darling, sweetie, sweetheart.
I pray everyone should
get a husband like you.
Don't say such things, baby.
God does answer ones pray sometimes.
Yes. What's troubling you now?
I am in trouble.
Anjali changed the shirt which
Simran has made me wear.
Now I am getting out of the building.
If Simran sees me, she
will start suspecting.
Please take care of it.
Hey, hello. Listen to me.
Take care of it.
But what should I...
- How did Shiv's clothes change?
- Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law, give me the papers.
I will get the test done.
Forget that.
First tell me, Shiv left the
house wearing a black shirt.
And now when I saw him downstairs,
he was wearing a blue shirt.
You mean the black shirt
appeared blue to you?
What do you mean?
It was blue.
No, sister-in-law. It happens.
You must have studied in science.
- No.
- Superb.
Then you will understand it better.
The sky is black in color, right?
But because of sun's ultraviolet
rays it appears blue to us.
It happens because of the distance.
But the distance wasn't that much, Karan.
I say there shouldn't be any
distance between you and Ram.
Not Ram, Shiv.
Shiv. Ram. Kishan. All are the same.
There is no distance between you two.
Where there is distance, there is love.
Where there is love, there is acceptance.
Where there is acceptance, there
is no scope for suspicion.
So, give me the papers. I
have to get the test done.
Fine.
Case solved.
Champa... sister-in-law
doesn't understand science.
Did you understand?
I understood.
But Mrs. Gupta didn't.
Once similarly Mr. Gupta's shirt changed.
- So she threw it down...
- The shirt?
No, Mr. Gupta.
Saw! Mr. Gupta would've survived if
his wife could understand science.
Science is very important.
What happened, dad?
Why are you staring at him?
I think I have seen him somewhere.
Where did I see him?
Dad, he owns a very big
business at such a young age.
You must have seen his photo
in a business magazine.
Yes, correct.
- I have seen his photo.
- Yes.
Where did I see his photo?
Are you married?
What are you saying, sir?
Marriage... I never got
married, even a little.
Young men these days are
always so tensed...
That they looked married
in spite of being single.
Don't worry. You are my future son-in-law.
I like him.
Thank you, dad.
Love you.
During our time, girls used to..
..run away when they heard
about their marriage.
And sir, nowadays don't even feel shy
when they run away from the house.
He is a funny guy.
Here, have some sweets.
Deepika's dad likes me.
Congratulations. Now your
funeral is confirmed.
Not funeral, you evil one. The fourth one.
You are getting happy as if
this is your first wedding.
Yes, it is my first one, happening
willingly. The others were...
Mother?
I seek your blessings, mother.
Bholu. God bless you, son.
How are you?
I am fine. How are you?
How can I be fine?
You got married a year ago.
When will you come to the village
with my daughter-in-law?
Mother, I'll come as soon as I
can spare some time from work.
If you cannot come with her then
at least send me her photograph.
If you don't send her photo..
..then I'll come there and take
her to our village with me.
Take her away, mother. I will at
least get rid of one trouble.
Idiot, you are address
your wife as trouble?
Remember... never break a woman's heart.
And never ruin a family.
I haven't, mother. You can
ask anyone you want to.
Who do I ask? That idiot
also stays with you.
- He is right here.
- Say hi.
He says hi.
May God keep him happy.
Mother wants you to consume poison and die.
What?
No, mother. I am just joking.
Fine.
Send her photo as soon as you are free.
Okay, mother. I will send it.
Take care of yourself. Okay, bye. Love you.
- What happened?
- Mother wants my wife's photograph.
Then send it. Send any one
of the three's photo.
A few days ago, father had called.
He said he wanted my wife's photo.
The problem is, I don't remember
whose photo I had sent him.
So what difference does it make?
Anyway your parents stay separately.
They got divorced 15 years ago.
Send anyone's photograph.
It won't make a difference.
Whose shall I send? Anjali or Juhi?
Simran is too much for a village...
Send Juhi's.
I should send Juhi's? Mother will like her.
Excuse me.
Your cap.
- Your cap.
- Thank you so much.
You are welcome.
I see you cycling here every day.
Oh yeah. And I see you jogging.
Right.
Would you like to have some juice?
- Yeah, sure. Come.
- Let's go.
By the way, where do you stay?
Cocktail Tower.
No ways! Really?
I too stay at Cocktail Tower.
- Shut up! Which floor!
- Which floor!
- Fourth floor.
- I live on the eighth floor.
We stay in the same building and
we met each other only today.
I know. Actually my husband says...
"In such big societies everyone
is busy doing their own thing."
"No one disturbs anyone."
- My husband too says the same thing.
- Really?
Our husbands think alike.
Then we should get them together some day.
Now that we have met, they
too will have to meet.
- Right.
- What will you have?
I always have Indian gooseberry juice.
One watermelon juice and one
Indian gooseberry juice.
Sorry, madam. The Indian
gooseberry juice just got over.
I have just one glass left.
And she has ordered for it.
You can have it.
I will have something else.
No, it's okay. Really.
I just heard you saying that
you always have that one.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
One orange juice, please.
- Give this one to her.
- Okay, madam.
Oh my God.
- It feels so good to talk to both of you.
- Right?
I wish we have met sooner.
I get so bored at home.
I am facing the same problem.
You know, same here.
But I have joined a ladies' club.
In fact, our club is having
an annual function next week.
It is going to be a very big event.
I am telling you, you should join it.
You two should join it. We
will have a lot of fun.
It will help us kill some time.
And we will also get a
chance to meet each other.
- Not a bad idea.
- Yeah, actually.
- By the way...
- Simran.
- Juhi.
- I am Anjali.
Sweetheart, why don't you go
and do it in the balcony?
Okay.
Oh God.
Listen...
Yes?
How come your underwear fell from upstairs?
Upstairs?
Yes, it fell from one of
the floors above ours.
How is that possible?
That's what even I am wondering...
How can your underwear fall
from someone else's house?
I am not the only one in this building
wearing underwear of this brand.
Someone else too can wear
one of the same brand.
Yes, I know.
That's why I embroider a
star on all your underwears.
What?
Here, look at this.
Why did you have to show your
talent on the underwear?
Forget that.
First tell me how did it fell from
one of the floors above ours?
What do I know? You should
have been more careful.
You remember your father's
death anniversary...
But you don't know where your
husband's underwear keeps wandering.
- Father's death anniversary?
- Yes.
- Whose father's death anniversary?
- Whose...?
If you had one, you would
have remembered, right?
You want to play with the kids.
You don't know where the
underwear has been playing...
And you want to play with the kids.
What are you saying?
"What are you saying?"
Madam...
Madam, my sir's underwear had fallen down.
This underwear belongs to
the owner of this house.
No, it belongs to my sir.
Hey, won't I recognize
my husband's underwear?
And won't I recognize my sir's underwear?
I am the one who always removes it.
What?
I mean I wash it and keep it for drying.
So I am the one who will remove it, right?
Today as usual, I was
removing it but it fell down.
- Now give it back.
- I told you, it belongs to my husband.
Why are you looking the other way?
Tell her whose underwear it is.
Tell her.
- Sir!
- What sir?
It is mine.
Yes, it is yours.
It's mine, and I have taken it.
Now go away from here.
But sometimes you...
Why sometimes? I wear it every day.
Have you ever seen me without an underwear?
Oh God.
Why God? It's my underwear. I am taking it.
Now go away from here. Go.
How did this happen?
Oh Lord.
She ruined my mood so early in the morning.
Go and get a cup of coffee for me.
Go.
How do I tell her?
Thank you so much, sister-in-law.
You took such good care of my underwear.
Give my underwear to Ram.
I mean give my regards to Ram.
Coffee? No.
Oh, you have already made it?
Fine, then I will have some.
She is stupid.
She doesn't recognize her
employer's underwear.
She is just his maid, not his wife.
True.
But I still don't understand...
How did your underwear fell from
one of the floors above ours?
Like it fell from above... some day
it must have fallen down from here.
And this stupid maid must've
thought it's her employer's...
And took it upstairs with her.
Again if falls down, something similar
will happen. Up and down, this is life.
Don't try to think about that.
Think about this. Look at this.
The marital fast. Heavy discount.
Wow, discount.
You will come with me for shopping?
- Definitely.
- Awesome.
I will buy four new underwears for you.
- Sure.
- Throw this one away.
I wonder who all must have worn it.
Disgusting.
When did sir go downstairs?
Champa?
What happened? Why do you look so baffled?
Mr. Karan, I just don't understand.
What is it that you don't understand?
Look, I was removing the
clothes from the balcony.
Sir's underwear fell Slipped from hands.
I saw it landing on the sixth floor. Okay?
When I went down there,
sir was already there.
- He was already there?
- Yes.
Champa, he was bound to be there.
Have you studied science?
I never went to school.
Superb. Then you will
understand this even better.
Scientist Newton has said...
If you throw two things from a height...
The one with more weight
reaches down first.
Now tell me what weighs more
your sir or his underwear?
- Sir.
- So who will reach down first?
- Sir.
- So you are so smart.
Yet you look baffled.
Don't tell your madam about this.
She will think that you are stupid.
I am not that stupid.
I know Newton.
I work at his place as well.
- Yes.
- Okay, bye.
You know, here there is an offer
of buy one and get two free.
Really?
There are many places
where you get three free.
- Really?
- Yes.
Here you go.
Thank God, we became friends.
Otherwise I would have to
come for shopping alone.
Seriously.
By the way, this idea of yours
of doing shopping was great.
And your idea of embroidering a star
on the underwear was mind blowing.
Stop it.
Why should I stop it? When
I wear a tight pants...
It has got imprinted on my...
Which floor?
- First floor. Let's go.
- Come.
Let's also buy a watch.
Who needs a watch, baby...
when one's time is going bad?
I want to buy lingerie.
Are you coming with me?
No, I want to buy some bangles.
- Second floor.
- Thanks.
- Sweetheart listen...
- Yes?
Nothing. Go ahead, I will
go and get the trolley.
- Okay?
- You are just too much. Hurry up.
Kishan!
Juhi! What are you doing here?
I came here for shopping.
But how did you get the
time to visit a mall?
I didn't get the time. I came
here with my boss for some work.
You don't have time for your wife.
And you are visiting a mall with your boss?
Come with me, let's do some shopping.
Shopping... No. Let's go this way instead.
Why over there?
My boss is over there.
He will get angry if he
will see you with me.
Is he your boss or your wife
that he will get angry?
Nowadays boss think that
they are the wife, darling.
Come, let's go there and shop.
Over there, we don't have to fear anyone.
Only if your office will leave you alone.
Give it to me. Let me talk to them.
I will tell them...
I disconnected it.
Why is he disconnecting my call?
Look, you will get Everything over here.
Go and check it out. Go. Go. Go.
Excuse me.
I need your help.
Yes?
Actually, I am here to buy
clothes for a newborn.
But I have no idea what kind
of clothes suit on babies.
Everything suits well on babies.
But just remember that the
material should be soft.
Money is not a problem.
I have a lot of money.
I just want the clothes to be good.
Hold on... Look over there.
That's the best brand for kids.
I don't use credit cards. In my
business we always deal with cash.
I think you can't hear me properly.
I mean yearning to hear...
a child's laughter.
I am making preparations for that.
You don't understand... hold on.
Let me call my husband.
He will help you. Okay? Have a look around.
- Listen...
- Yes? Are you done? Shall we leave?
Please help him.
I am unable to help myself and
you want me to help others?
- It will take just two minutes. Please help him.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me?
Strange. No one is ready to help me.
- Let's go. Let's go from here...
- My bangles.
They sell secondhand goods here. Let's go.
- We won't buy anything from here.
- Secondhand things in a mall?
Here it is, Mr. Gulabchand.
Please check it.
Can you see properly?
- Are we doing shopping or jogging?
- Let's go.
I can see everything very clearly.
I can see everything really very clearly.
I will get into trouble
if my boss spots me.
Oh no.
What's he doing over here?
What happened?
I'll go and drink some water, okay?
Hey...
Okay. So he is his boss.
Who was that guy with you?
He was my husband.
- Husband?
- He brought his wife here for shopping.
Do you have a problem with that?
No, I don't have any problem.
But you should stay happy, dear.
How can I be happy?
He doesn't come home for two
days at a time because of you.
Because of me?
You have made one man
in-charge of four offices.
I... - And then you also ask him
to accompany you to a mall.
When did I...
You should come here with
your wife for shopping...
And not my husband.
- But...
- Are you gay?
- I have a daughter.
- Move aside.
Fraud.
He is already married.
And he wants to marry my daughter as well.
Sorry, sister.
- Sister!
- Anjali!
- Where were you?
- Where was I?
- Where were you?
- You have been calling me.
I have been disconnecting your calls.
Where have you been?
I have been looking for you.
You had gone to take a trolley, right?
I found a tractor instead...
I met my boss up there.
He made me go crazy.
- Your boss?
- Yes.
- He followed you here?
- Yes.
And if he sees us here, he
will take me back to office.
Let's get out of here, quickly.
Are we shopping or running?
The discounts will get over.
I am so dead.
He will not leave me alone here either.
Oh, so he is your boss.
He has made our lives miserable.
I will teach him a lesson.
Who was the guy who was
just talking to you?
- He was my husband.
- Husband?
Do you have a problem with that?
No, I don't have any problem.
But you are going to have a problem.
He has two...
Not two, he is handling
four offices for you.
Because of you he doesn't get
any time to spend with me.
We have a crib at home but no child.
Crib? Child?
- I am...
- You are his boss. But I am his wife.
Let me warn you, tomorrow we
celebrate the marital fast day.
If you don't send him home
before the moon rises..
.. then I'll be your worst enemy.
Got it? Move aside now!
The first one doesn't know that
he already has a second one.
And the second one isn't aware
of the first one's existence.
You!
What are you doing over here?
Surprise!
You give a lot of surprises.
Now I can give only what I get, darling.
Look what I bought for you. How is this?
Is this of my size?
Size? It will fit someone or the other.
Look at the color, baby. Look at the color.
How's the color?
Forget that. Come with me.
Let me show you what I have selected.
Come with me.
Stay here. I will be right back.
Where did that scoundrel go?
He was here just a moment ago.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.
This girl pulled me inside.
What do you mean by pulled you?
My husband was standing here.
So he is your husband as well?
What do you mean by yours as well?
Excuse me... what do you want, sir?
Oxygen.
Then why are looking for it over here?
Go outside.
Three wives?
Instead of marrying such
a boy, I'll be happy..
..if my daughter stays
Unmarried all her life.
Where is he? Let me get hold of him...
He will spend the marital
fast day in prison.
No. No, dear.
Okay, take it.
May I help you, ma'am?
- Yeah, please.
- Yeah. No problem.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- No problem.
I will help you take this outside.
Hello.
When is her birthday?
Actually, we came shopping
for her birthday.
Fourth wife?
That too with a child?
She will cut the cake today.
Stop. Stop.
Stop. Stop.
She too is your wife, right?
Excuse me. He is not my husband.
He is just helping me.
You shouldn't have told the truth.
You should have lied like
the other three did.
The other three girls lied
because I asked them to...
Together we fooled him.
You ruined it for me.
Come, let me help you get outside.
April fool.
You...
Mind blowing.
April fool?
Good that he fooled you.
But...
You are suspicious about him, right?
That's why he did this to you.
- But... in front of everyone in the mall...
- But what?
How could you even think that
one man can marry three times?
Stop laughing. Please. Stop laughing.
Stop laughing.
The boy who can make an April fool
of me in the month of October...
He can do anything.
Stop laughing...
Stop laughing.
I am expressing my sorrow
and you are dancing?
Sit down.
Sit.
You know what happened today?
All the three stumps
where balled away, boss.
My three wives fought
with Deepika's father.
But you know, your brother
still didn't get stumped out.
I took the fourth one in front
of him and said April fool.
Brother, you are sloshed.
So far I just have three.
The fourth one is yet to come, my brother.
Fourth is pending.
You know everything.
But fourth is not actually fourth.
She is the first.
You know everything.
She met me first.
She loved me first.
She wanted to marry me first.
But before we marry... I was buried.
You know everything.
I met with three accidents,
got three wives.
And not in a very big gap.
One after the other, boss.
One after the other.
I was attacked thrice.
The earth moved away from below my feet.
But I am still standing.
Do you understand?
You know everything.
I understand, my brother.
What do you understand?
What do you understand?
Do you understand what happens
when Anjali changes..
..the shirt Simran had made me wear?
Do you understand what happens
I address Juhi as Anjali?
He says he understands.
He understands.
Have you ever seen a star
embroidered on an underwear?
She makes such a big star with a
thick thread on my underwear.
I cannot tell the second one
that what is hurting me...
Because it has been made by the first one.
Do you understand?
When my three wives affectionately
feed me, I love that.
It's love, emotions.
But...
Do you understand the motions
caused because of those emotions?
You only understand Newton.
Call your Newton here.
Call him here. Forget three,
get him married just twice...
You can change my name if your
Newton won't take a u-turn.
He understands.
Tomorrow is the marital fast day.
All my three wives have said
that they want me before..
..them when the moon rises.
Face to face.
Ask... ask your uncle.. what is his name?
Ask Newton, does he have any formula...
Is there any idea to produce one man
at three places at the same time?
Is there any science?
He understands.
Man...
You know...
You know...
What do you know?
But You know everything, Boss.
You got me trapped in three marriages.
Now You are the one who will
get me out of this mess.
And You are the one who
will help the moon rise.
And You are the one who will
help me rise out of this mess.
Otherwise, I will be dead, Boss.
Please save me.
I am like your younger brother.
The one up above...
Hello?
Hello!!
All across the country married woman..
..are fasting for their
husband's long life.
Woman got all decked up and are
ready in the morning itself.
And as the dusk arrives..
..they all have either gone to the
terrace or are near the windows.
Now they are waiting for the moon to rise.
The moon rise is expected
in another half an hour.
There is only half an hour
left for the moon to rise.
How will you show all three,
your face at the same time?
Have you thought of something?
I have.
The moon will be seen and so will I.
Hello?
You are waiting for me, right?
But I am not coming.
- What?
- What?
Your husband does everything
differently, sweetheart.
As we got married in a different manner...
We should end your fast
also in a different way.
The name you are hiding in your palm...
Go and look out from the balcony...
He has brought the moon
in this palm for you..
Listen...
Where can I find Shivram Kishan?
Go straight, on the right
there is a temple.
You will find them there.
Go and call him here. Tell
him his father is here.
I should call the Gods?
Are you drunk?
You are joking with a senior citizen?
- Shivram Kishan is my son's name.
- Oh.
Listen...
I don't like drinking.
I drink to drown my sorrows.
This is what Rishi Kapoor said.
Oh no, Rishi Kapoor didn't say that.
He was the hero of the film.
Anand Bakshi said it.
I listen to the radio 24/7.
I know everything.
You remember the names of the
people in the film industry.
Uncle...
- You are a watchman.
- Why did he come here?
You should know who all
stay in this building.
Uncle...
Sorry.
Karan!
I seek your blessings.
God bless you.
How are you?
I am absolutely fine.
Tell me where in this labyrinth
does our Bholu stay?
Come with me.
What bring you here all of a sudden?
It's not sudden, son.
I've been planning to meet my son
and his wife since a long time.
So I came here today.
Come on, quickly take me to their house.
House? Which house?
I mean which wife's photo had he sent you?
Which wife?
Does he have many?
No. I mean which photo of
his wife did he send you?
Actually, the security of
this place is very tight.
You have to show the
owner's photo at the lift.
Only then does it stop at that floor.
I am telling the truth.
Strange.
This is the photo he has sent me.
Oh, sixth floor.
Come with me. Come, let's go.
Even the army doesn't
have such tight security.
This is how it is here.
Son, will I need to show
the photo every day?
No. Once it is logged into
the system, I mean stored...
You just have to come and press
on the 6th floor button..
If you press any other button,
it will ring the alarm.
Oh. Fine.
We have reached.
Your Bholu stays here. And
your nave daughter-in-law.
From Kumar Shivram Kishan to Ram Kumar?
People make a big name in the city
and he has cut his name short.
That's because he does big things, uncle.
Yes, Karan?
Your father is here.
Father is here? Where is he?
- He is here.
- Here where?
Here, at your house, on the sixth floor.
What? Father has come from the village.
Mother...
Not your mother, your father is here.
Mother too is here.
She is standing right before me.
What do I do now?
What will you do?
Do one thing...
You had sent her Juhi's photo, right?
Quickly take her to the fourth floor.
Then we will decide what we should do.
I... will meet you in some time. Okay?
Vishal, how do I know where
you can find fried bread.
Mother!
Mother!
- I seek your blessing.
- My Bholu!
Always be happy, son.
You have gone fat.
- Fat?
- Yes.
You are the first mother in this
world to call her child fat.
Usually all mothers say,
"You have lost weight."
Son, I thought I should say something
different as I am in the city.
Otherwise you will think that
your mother is orthodox.
Okay. But, why did you come
here without informing me?
- Why? Did you feel bad?
- Yes, of course.
No, I mean if you would have informed
me I would have sent one or two...
Sent one or two... where? Why? How?
- What do you mean?
- My office staff.
To receive you.
- I know how busy you are.
- Yes, mother.
That's why I came here
without informing you.
Come on, introduce me to your wife.
- You did the right thing.
- Come on, let's go.
You did the right thing, mother.
Come...
It's a big house.
Juhi, look who is here.
Why did you bring her? Couldn't
you find anyone younger?
- Younger?
- Yes.
What work will a maid of
this age be able to do?
Maid?
Not a maid, she is my mother.
Your mother-in-law.
Come here and seek her blessings.
Mother! I am sorry.
- I am sorry, mother.
- God bless you, dear.
God bless you.
I know females in the city
only wait for their maids.
But dear, mothers and sisters
too pay a visit sometimes.
Wow. Well said, mother. You are amazing.
Shut up.
Go and keep my bags inside.
But why didn't you inform us
that you are coming here?
From where I am, we only
inform when someone leaves...
Not when someone arrives.
Father didn't come with you?
Your father left 15 years ago.
I am so sorry, mother.
- I didn't know that father is no longer..
- He is alive.
He is very much alive.
And he is having a lot of fun too.
After he married a fair-skinned
female from Kashmir we parted ways.
But father, why did you
and mother separate?
Now what do I say, dear?
A breeze blew and a flower
fell off from the branch...
It's either the fault of the
breeze nor of the branch.
I didn't get you.
Let me explain.
The thing is, uncle liked to recite
poetry when he was in the army.
The army man part of him has retired
but the poet in him is still active.
This was a poetry?
Yes.
Father, you should stop reciting poetries.
I am sure mother will come back to you.
When are you giving me "the good news"?
Mother, I will go and meet Karan.
- Okay.
- Mother, Karan will give you "the good news."
He spends me time with him than with me.
Did you hear her taunt?
Son, your father was in the army.
Yet he spared enough time to make it
possible for me to see your face.
Mother, you have started talking
about children as soon as you came.
Sit, relax. Enjoy your breakfast.
I will back in a jiffy. Okay?
He has not one but four offices, uncle.
Why does he need four offices?
Why doesn't he combine all four
and get them under one roof?
Have you studied science, uncle?
No.
Superb. Then you will
understand this even better.
When sulfate, oxygen, nitrogen and
hydrogen are filled into a cylinder...
It doesn't just burn a stove
but the entire house.
It causes a blast.
Are you married?
No.
Then you will understand this even better.
A house runs on home-science
and not science.
Okay, uncle.
Father, when did you arrive?
I seek your blessings.
Father! Where are you these days?
Your wife told me that you
don't come home at night.
Are you a businessman or a watchman?
What do I do? I have a lot of work to do.
I don't get the time.
You need to balance your
work and your home life.
- Because a house..
- Runs on home-science and not science.
Heard that?
He is not even married
and yet he understands.
You too should understand.
You should spend some time
with your wife as well.
You should keep her happy.
I keep her happy. Now do you
want me to crack jokes to her?
You keep me happy?
Tell me, what's so special about tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Forget whatever it is.
Tomorrow we are going to give
father a tour of Mumbai.
He is leaving the day after tomorrow.
Who said I am leaving?
I have just come here.
I want to meet my old friends.
I am not going anywhere
for another 20 days.
Dear, you were saying something, right?
What's so special about tomorrow?
Father, tomorrow is my birthday.
- Really?
- Did you remember?
Yes, of course.
A man can lose his memory but
never forget his wife's birthday.
Tomorrow I will celebrate your
birthday in such a way...
You will feel as if it's
your first birthday.
Bholu, have you made all the arrangements?
Yes, father. I am on it.
Okay, listen, I am going to the market...
To buy a gift for Anjali.
- Don't cut the cake until I come back.
- Okay.
Sweetheart, I must say... you
don't look like 35 years old.
Hey! Shut up! I am only 26.
Heard that?
If I had asked a direct question
she would have said 21.
Now she at least mentioned
somewhere close to her real age.
Karan, check who is at the door.
Doomed!
Simran and Juhi.
What?
Your two wives have come
to meet the third one.
Why have they come to meet her?
What do I know?
Open the door. Someone is ringing the bell.
It's the kids, darling.
- They are just ringing the bell and running away.
- Yes.
I don't think it's the kids,
my friends must be here.
I have invited them as well.
- I'll go and answer the door.
- Friends?
When did they become friends?
I am so dead.
Yes, actually.
- Hi!
- Hi!
Hi Juhi! Hi Simran!
- I was waiting for you two.
- I am hiding myself.
- What are you doing?
- Happy birthday.
- There is no place to hide here.
- Many many happy returns of the day.
Thank you so much.
- Move aside, Karan.
- Why didn't you tell us beforehand?
We would have brought a gift for you.
Your husbands didn't accompany you?
My husband is on a night duty.
Mine too.
Luckily my husband is at home today.
- He is on my duty today.
- Back off.
Come, let me introduce you to my husband.
Let's go.
- I am going to jump down.
- Have you lost your mind? You will die.
I just got lucky.
- What have you...
- Let me explain.
To you, to you and to you too.
And me as well. You have
ruined everyone's cake.
And your face is also
completely unrecognizable.
Really?
Happy birthday to you.
What's wrong with your voice?
I swallowed the candle along with the cake.
The candle keeps flickering inside.
I cannot speak properly.
But why did you put your face on the cake?
It's your birthday. Everybody would
have applied cake on your face.
I thought I should apply
it on mine instead.
You are just too much. Go
and quickly wash your face.
Then I will introduce you to them.
No. Today is your birthday.
This is your birthday cake.
I will stay this way all day long.
Let me meet your friends.
Hello, Simran. Hello, Juhi.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Wait a minute. How do you know their names?
Sister-in-law, you took their names
when you met them at the door.
Oh.
The cake is on my face
and not inside my ears.
Karan, what are you doing over here?
I.. sister-in-law, I am a lawyer.
I handle all the legal matters.
Sister-in-law, she is my sister-in-law.
And sister-in-law, she is my sister-in-law.
All married female in this
building are my sisters-in-law.
I have 32 sisters-in-law and 30 brothers.
Why are there 2 less brothers?
There are two extra sisters-in-law.
Idiot!
Have you come here to celebrate
my wife's birthday or..
..count your brothers and sisters-in-law?
Happy birthday to you.
Thank you, sweetheart. Come,
let's click a selfie.
Superb idea.
I too will click a selfie
with my hubby on my birthday.
Go ahead, click it. I didn't stop you.
- With you?
- Yes.
All husbands look the same when
they have cake on their face.
My God, your husband is so funny.
- I know.
- I think we all need a photo.
- Yes. Let's take a selfie. Come.
- Yeah.
Come, my sisters-in-law.
Come, come.
I'll show this photo to everyone
at the club's function tomorrow.
Smile!
Rukmani?
You?
I am seeing you after ages.
How are you?
See for yourself...
How incomplete your soldier is without you.
You had brought a fair-skinned
female from Kashmir, right?
I fell in love with her because
I missed you, Rukmani.
I could see your face in hers.
I was a fool not to be able to see your
face in a doctor or an engineer's face.
And I kept waiting for you.
You don't know...
The day that female came before me...
That night the temperature
had gone below zero.
Even if the temperature falls,
a person resistance shouldn't.
Please forget about it.
Please forgive me.
That girl from Kashmir passed
away after five years.
That was bound to happen.
Not everyone can survive
a soldier's attitude.
You are just too much.
You know that our Bholu got married?
Yes, my Bholu's wife is so sweet.
She is really well-cultured.
She takes good care of me.
- She takes such good care of me.
- Of me as well..
When did you meet her?
I am staying with her.
Who are you staying with?
- She is with me.
- What are you saying?
- On which floor are you staying?
- On the fourth floor.
And I am on the sixth.
This means... this means..!
Your son is just like you.
He too got married twice.
Today it's either him or me.
Wait, Rukmani.
I have seen happiness in my
daughter-in-law's eyes...
And loyalty in my son's eyes.
I too noticed that.
We will talk to him.
But until then, we will let
things be as they are.
We will meet the mornings and
evenings, here, in the garden.
Will you come to meet me, Rukmani?
I have been waiting for you
since the past 15 years.
And still you ask me that question.
Father?
Mother?
What happened? Why did you two stop?
Hurry up.
If we are late, the performance
in the club will begin.
That's my friend.
Fantastic!
Come on, let's go meet her. Let's go.
Sure.
Hi!
Superb performance Deepika.
We thoroughly enjoyed it.
Meet my friends, Anjali and Juhi.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We loved your performance.
- You were stunning.
- Thank you.
Thank you isn't enough.
You will have to come to my place for tea.
- Sure.
- And have lunch at my place.
And dinner at my place.
We three stay in the same building.
Oh wow. In the same building?
So cool.
So tell us, when are you coming?
Actually, I am soon going to get married.
I will come with my husband.
Promise?
Promise.
Thank you.
- Give it to her.Okay.
- Thank you.
You know, I always have an ice-candy
from here whenever I go from here?
It's yummy, you know.
But you shouldn't consume so many calories.
Husbands keep their arm around
your waist only till its slim.
I think you shouldn't fall in
love looking only at the waist.
Love should be forever.
Like them, you know.
- My mother-in-law.
- My father-in-law.
What?
They are your mother-in-law
and father-in-law?
I am so sorry. I thought
they are husband and wife.
What is this my mother
doing here, in Mumbai?
And my father-in-law too.
You are here and the brightness is back.
Otherwise, the lamps were
losing their luminance.
At this age one should be lighting
lamps in front of the photo.
And you want to bring light
back into your life.
Stop your nonsense. Have
you lost your mind?
I am telling the truth. Your
father is romancing at this age.
Who will he romance with at this age?
You know my friend Juhi, who
stays on the fourth floor?
He is having an affair
with her mother-in-law.
You mean mother and father have met?
Mother and father?
Our father and their mother have met?
Yes. We saw them together twice today.
The first time we saw them, They were
hugging each other in the garden.
And the second time at Bandstand,
drinking coconut water.
Is it?
One heart tells to the other.
I have fallen in love, again.
Father is back.
Ask him where was he.
Father...
Where were you?
Dear, I had gone to the army
club to kill some time.
Oh really? But there is
no army club over here.
Yes, there isn't.
I searched hard, but I couldn't find it.
And you, come inside.
I want to discuss something
very important with you.
Can I finish a small task
and then join you, father?
- Do come back.
- Sure.
Listen... why was he staring at you
as if you are doing something wrong?
This is the problem with senior citizens.
They do something wrong and pretend
as if you are doing something wrong.
Just make sure that he
doesn't call up mother.
- Mother?
- Their mother... the one he is having an affair with.
Not my mother.
Yes.
"For the first time, I have seen
love in my beloved's eyes."
Mother...
You were not in the garden.
Where were you?
I met a lady of this
building in the garden.
I went to attend a spiritual
discourse with her.
Okay.
You really enjoying attending a
spiritual discourse, don't you?
Dear, at this age one enjoys
attending spiritual discourses.
Make me a cup of tea, please.
Should I give you coconut water instead?
I already had coconut water.
At the spiritual discourse?
But the coconut water is
found in the coconut.
I think you are tired.
Let me make tea for you instead.
- Where is mother?
- Kishan, come here.
You should send mother back to the village.
Why? You cannot serve her anymore?
No. You don't know.
Mother is having an affair.
- What nonsense!
- Honestly.
She is romancing sixth floor's
Anjali's father-in-law.
Oh really?
- You aren't surprised.
- I am surprised.
A lot, from within. But what can we do?
When someone stays away from
someone for a long time...
This happens.
But this is wrong.
Why? Don't you get upset when you
have to spend two nights without me?
Mother got separated from
father 15 years ago.
It is possible that mother
sees her husband in that man.
Oh really?
- In how many woman do you see me?
- Three.
Two of them are married
and one is still single.
If you ask stupid questions
you will get stupid replies.
Just make sure she doesn't call up father.
Their father.
Do I have to explain everything?
When did I ask that?
But you were going to.
You know darling, I love you.
So I know what you are about to ask.
I love you too.
I pray everyone gets a husband like you.
Okay. Okay.
'What does he do?'
'He works at a security agency, sir.'
'Are you sure he is the one you
are going to get married to?'
'Yes, sir.'
- I just spoke to Anjali.
- Okay.
She is coming with her husband.
Let's take her along.
I keep dreaming about having a child...
Whereas you don't even have
time to love your wife.
There is a time to love, sweetheart.
You want me to love you
now, in front of everyone?
Love you, sweetheart.
Anjali?
Strange. You just said no to love.
It's a completely different feeling
to love after refusing to.
I won't let you go.
You are so sweet.
Her husband is so romantic.
He started in the compound itself.
So sweet.
I pray everyone gets a husband like him.
I am late once again.
What lie will I say today?
Sir?
Champa!
Madam!
- Who is she?
- My maid.
It doesn't feel right.
Now I have loved you in front of
everyone because you insisted.
What will people say if
they see us like this?
Go. Your friends must be waiting for you.
Go on.
How does he know?
I sometimes don't understand
what he says or does.
- Disgusting.
- What happened, Champa?
Sir, I don't understand what
is going on in this society.
Sir was hugging some other woman.
And madam was watching it. And
she didn't even say anything.
- It's nothing.
- It's nothing?
You say it's nothing?
Now if someone else gets "the good news"...
Don't tell anyone that I told you
that sir was with someone else...
Champa... Have you studied science?
Does this too involve Newton?
No, this is medical science.
What he was doing was..
..called mouth-to-mouth
artificial respiration system.
What?
I mean to breathe into someone
else's mouth through your mouth.
Champa, it is possible that that
lady was having a problem breathing.
So he was helping her.
Sir, I know what I saw. He was hugging her.
Now he can't go breathe into
every woman's mouth, can he?
Wouldn't he be considered characterless?
- What are you saying?
- Yes.
Instead of mouth-to-mouth he must
be giving chest-to-chest science.
Oh. Now I understood. I understood.
Don't tell that to sister-in-law.
She will think that you are stupid.
Sir, I am not that stupid. I
understand mouth-to-mouth.
But sir, I got confused because
it was chest-to-chest.
Sir, will you do me a favor?
Yes, Champa?
Can you accompany in the lift?
Why?
Because sometimes I have
problem breathing in the lift.
- Please come with me, sir.
- Get lost.
Yes, I do.
Yes, Deepu?
Kumar, dad just called me up.
He was saying strange things about you.
I fought with him.
Really? What did he say?
First come and meet me. And
also bring Karan along.
I want to discuss something very important.
What? Court marriage?
Yes, there is no other option left.
My dad keeps having strange
suspicions about you.
Today, once again he said there
is already someone in your life.
Oh really?
- Did he say that?
- Yes.
But I swear, Deepika. You
are the only one I love.
I know.
That's why I want us to get
married as soon as possible.
She is right. Quietly go to
the court and get married.
It won't create a scene. And
it is better for you as well.
Try to understand.
Of course. And I will also
escape from facing any music.
I mean the music played at the wedding.
Okay then, done.
- You come to the court with your witness.
- Okay.
You come to the court with your witness.
I will get you two married.
- Perfect.
- Cheers to that.
Cheers.
Oh wow.
Somebody's looking hot today.
I'm going to meet a foreign delegation
that's why I am wearing a suit.
I'm not going to get married.
When did I say that you
are going to get married.
No...
I thought when you are going
through a bad phase...
Anyone starts suspecting
you for no good reason.
That's why I said all that.
Oh come on, Shiv.
Your love doesn't lack anything.
Why should I be suspicious of you?
You mean the world to me, baby.
Bye.
- Where?
- Not the maid, baby. I am saying bye to you.
I am in a little hurry.
You can note this one down. I
will settle the score tomorrow.
- Can I go now?
- Okay.
Thank you, baby.
- All the best.
- Bye.
Father, I am going to do
something very important.
I cannot do it without your blessing.
Son, I met your mother.
- Mother?
- Yes. Your mother.
What's this scene about having two of them?
- Well father, these two...
- What two?
Two 'Laddoos' (SWEETS). Offer
two of them Lord Hanuman.
And two at the Shani temple.
- I have pledged something.
- Okay, father.
He must have prayed for that old woman.
What else could it be?
Listen... brother has sent
clothes for the kids.
Come, I will show them to you.
I'll be right back, father.
Kids?
What all is he hiding?
Where are they?
- Yes?
- Where are you?
You won't be able to get married
if the judge leaves. Hurry up.
Okay, Anjali. See you in the evening.
Okay.
Bye, father. I am going. I am getting late.
Bye, sweetheart.
Bye.
He already has two wives,
now he wants a third one?
He is one step ahead of me.
I am going, mother.
Stop. Sit.
What's this scene about two marriages?
Look mother, the two...
Yes, mother. I will offer two 'Laddoos'.
Two to Lord Shani and two to Lord Hanuman.
- 'Laddoos'?
- Yes. That...
Yes. 'Laddoos'. Yes, do offer them.
Why are you offering 'Laddoos', mother?
For the peace in this house and
for him to come to his senses.
Doesn't everyone need to come
back to their senses, mother?
Yes, of course. So then I will
offer two for you as well.
I know why she is offering 'Laddoos'.
I am sure she must have
prayed for that old man.
Give me your blessings, mother.
So far I have only
accidentally done good deeds.
This time I am going to do a good deed...
Just pray that no accidents take place.
My blessings are always with you.
Just remember... never
break a woman's heart.
And never ruin a family.
Because of this I am going to end
up fulfilling 28 vows of marriage.
There are 7 vows in a marriage, not 28.
Yes, but for a person who
loves you four-fold...
For him 4 times 7 is 28.
What? Four?
You heard that, mother? That's why I say...
I pray that everyone
gets a husband like him.
He is. God is slowly giving it to everyone.
See you, mother.
Bye.
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.
Sorry, I got a little late.
You reached at the
accidental weddings on time.
And here when you were given a
specific time, you are late.
Forget about it now.
Where is Deepika, Karan?
She was here. She has
gone to get her witness.
We are so dead, brother.
- What happened?
- Look over there.
Oh damn. When did all four
of them meet each other?
What do I know?
Do one thing... I am
leaving, you handle them.
Why do you always get me trapped?
Say the witness met with an accident.
- Say something. Say anything.
- What will I say?
No, you take care of everything over there.
I will explain everything to them.
They will understand.
- I know. I trust them.
- What happened?
I will call you back, brother.
- Deepika, actually...
- Karan, what are you doing here?
What are all three of you doing over here?
Do you know each other?
He stays in our building.
Yes, and he handles our
husbands' legal matters.
Not just your husband, sister-in-law...
I also save her future husband.
I mean save his tax. It is my job.
But why hasn't Kumar reached as yet?
Actually, he just called me.
His witness met with a small accident.
What?
And Kumar is with him at the hospital.
But I am feeling really bad.
I am really sorry.
You have been troubled unnecessarily.
No. What can one do when
it's an emergency, right?
Yeah, actually. In fact, I am happy
that your boyfriend is so nice.
He thought saving someone's life is
more important than to get married.
I pray everyone gets a husband like him.
Of course, He will. He always does. I know.
I suggest, I'll take another date for
your wedding, say after two days?
Okay? Will that be fine?
Yes. I think that's perfect.
We too will come here on that date. Right?
- Yes, absolutely.
- Sure. No problem.
Okay, Deepika. Take care. Bye.
- Bye.
- Bye. Come with me, sister-in-law. This way.
Come, let's go and check.
I think you misheard him.
He is already married twice.
Why would want to get
married the third time?
After all he is our son,
and not some wild bull.
I am telling the truth, Rukmani.
He is here. Let's go
over there and enquire.
Mother?
Father?
What are they doing here?
Excuse me?
Where do couples get married?
They are getting married?!
They are in such a hurry!
They fell in love yesterday and today
there are in the court to get married.
Anjali, with the speed at
which they are going...
I think your husband will have a sibling
before you two can have a child.
Oh my God. I will go and inform Kishan.
And I will inform Ram.
Please check and let us know.
Look sir, no one by the name of Shivram
Kishan is getting married today.
Are you satisfied now?
Let's go now.
- Hi.
- It's good in a way.
- Hey..
- Hi.
- You are here.
- Yes, I am here.
You didn't go to the hospital
to save your friend's life?
I had. He survived so I came here.
You friend barely survived today.
So, shall we get married now?
But my witnesses have already left.
- Oh.Shall I call them back?
- No. Why?
Court marriages anyway don't last for long.
Let's do one thing... Let's
get married in a temple.
You reach at the temple with all the
things required for the wedding.
- Okay?
- How will I know what are the things required?
- Go.
- I am lawyer. What do you think I am?
Let's go. We will go to a temple
and get married over there.
Dad.
What did you think? You'll go to the
court and I won't come to know about it?
Then what else could I do?
You left me no choice.
So, this is your choice?
He is a cheat. How many times
do I have to tell you that?
He is a scoundrel. He is engaged.
No, he is not engaged.
Oh really? You are not engaged to anyone?
No, sir. I never got engaged to anyone.
Okay. I will show you.
Pooja!
Yes, sir?
Tell them. Are you engaged to him or not?
What will she say, sir? Let me tell you.
This is the first time I am meeting her.
And you say that I am engaged to her.
I didn't say that. She
is the one who told me.
Tell them.
Tell them.
Yes, sir.
- Saw?
- No.
- He is telling the truth.
- What?
I am not engaged to him.
Heard her, dad?
Hey, but...
Then why do you have this
photograph pinned up on your desk?
Wait a minute.
I had left this photo
of Kumar on your table.
- You?
- Yes.
- But this...
- Yes, sir. I too had brought my fianc's photograph.
But I don't know how it got changed.
I didn't want to lose my job, sir.
Hence I didn't say anything.
- I am very sorry, sir.
- What sorry?
Because of your mistake I
suspected my future son-in-law.
I broke my daughter's heart.
You are fired. Find a new job.
Get out.
Spare her, sir.
Anyway, a person only lies
when he or she is helpless.
And no one can know that better than me.
Let it be, sir.
Yes, dad. Please forgive her.
Fine, I will forgive her
because you have asked me to.
- Go.
- Thank you.
Thank you, sir. Because of
you I didn't lose my job.
No problem. I anyway have a bad
habit of rescuing girls...
Even if by doing that I end up trapping
myself. No problem. Please carry on.
Thank you, sir.
Now I shall never doubt you.
And I will also get you two married.
That too in a grand manner.
- Nice?
- Friends, relatives...
Everyone should get an invitation.
- It should be a grand wedding.
- Sure.
And distribute all these
invitation cards today itself.
Daddy, these are my personal invites.
- I will send them.
- Okay. Not a problem.
Hey... welcome. Come in.
Wow, papa. The preparations
are going on in full swing.
Sister-in-law, let me know if
you need me to do anything.
Yes, there is something.
Sweetheart!
Karan, you stay at the
Cocktail Tower, right?
- Yes, sister-in-law.
- Three of my friends stay there.
I have already called them up. You
just need to give them these invites.
Okay? Thank you.
Brother, your three wives will
be attending your wedding.
Now how will you get married?
The date is fixed. The invites
have been distributed.
Don't worry, I will get married.
You just wait and watch.
It's going to be your funeral.
- Papa, I wanted to say something.
- Yes, son?
- You are doing a lot for our wedding.
- Yes.
I too have a small desire.
Tell me, what is it? I am
ready to do anything you say.
Because one gets married
just once in a lifetime.
It's not like one gets married 3-4 times.
So, tell me.
Yes. At my wedding, I want
everyone to recall their wedding.
Let me not be the only groom present there.
Let Deepika not be the
only bride present there.
Every boy should be a groom and
every girl should be a bride.
Son, I am getting you two married.
I am not organizing a group wedding.
No, we are the only ones who
will be getting married.
But you know, every boy
should be dressed as a groom.
Every girl should be dressed as a bride.
You know, it's going to be a theme wedding.
Each couple looks like a newlywed couple.
- Wow. What a great idea!
- Yeah.
Isn't it, dad?
Yes.
Of course.
Get my wedding dress.
Priest, you are going in slow motion
and that is causing me loose motions.
- Please hurry up a little. Please go.
- Sure.
My brother! My brother! My brother!
You have come up with an amazing theme!
No one knows anything.
Since morning two sisters-in-law
have kissed me...
They thought I am their husband.
No one's father can recognize
who is the real groom.
Where is Kumar?
He has made so many
idiots dressed as grooms.
Kumar!
Sorry, sorry. Hello.
Kumar?
Uncle, your groom is over there.
What made you come up with
such a strange scheme.
No one is able to recognize anyone.
Papa, I am over here.
Saw? No one is able to recognize anyone.
Thank God the brides aren't hiding
their faces under the veil.
Otherwise I would've been
slapped 40 times since morning.
Papa, before a few more brides join us
why don't you call for my bride, please?
Son, that's why I am here.
Deepu has been...
Look there she is.
Deepu!
Look dear, here he is.
Kumar, it would've been so nice if
your parents could've joined us..
..to celebrate this joyous occasion.
- They wanted to come, but they suffer from joint pain..
- Hernia.
Hernia?
Actually the joint pain is so
bad that it is causing hernia.
And that is why they cannot walk around.
Yes.
But it's not like we wanted
to them to do a parade.
They would've sat on the sofa..
..and gave their blessings to
their son and daughter-in-law.
But papa, they cannot even sit.
Actually, their piles have also swollen up.
Piles have swollen up?
But I had heard that
villagers are very healthy.
You have heard it right.
We consume pure clarified
butter and we have a lot fun.
Brijmohan!
- How do my parents know him?
- I don't know.
Congratulations.
I knew you would come.
- Hello, sister-in-law.
- Hello, brother.
I am so happy to see you here.
As you are here Deepu will
also get a mother's blessings.
Come with me.
Dear, seek their blessings.
Hello.
God bless you, dear.
He is my childhood friend Brijmohan.
Hi.
And he is my future son-in-law.
Seek their blessings, son.
God bless you, son.
He is well-cultured.
He is indeed well-cultured.
Your son too stays in
this city, doesn't he?
Why didn't he come with you?
He is handling four offices.
He doesn't have time to spare.
What a co-incidence!
- My son-in-law too handles four offices.
- Oh really?
Then son, always remember this.
You need to balance your
work and your home life.
- Because a house..
- Runs on home-science and not science.
Correct.
Who said that?
Today you won't come to know.
Today, everyone looks the same.
Come, let's go and meet our friends.
I mean let's go and find them.
Let's go, sister-in-law.
Look, my friends are here.
Come, let me introduce you to them.
Go ahead. I will be right back.
- Where are you going?
- I'll go and meet the priest.
Forget all that, come with me.
- You go ahead.
- Come with me.
Hi!
Simran! Anjali! Juhi!
- So good to see you guys.
- Hi.
- Congratulations...
- Leave, I'll handle them.
I am so happy for you, Deepika.
You are looking so beautiful.
Thank you, guys. Thank you.
Hey, won't you introduce
us to your husband?
Yes.
Please show us your face.
Why are you feeling so shy?
Let me show it to you.
He is my Kumar.
Karan!
No. There is some confusion.
Actually, you mistook me for
Kumar and dragged me here.
I too didn't stop you. The
excitement shouldn't end, right?
Where is Kumar?
I will go and find him.
Priest, why is it taking so long?
Quickly start the wedding.
First let me get all the things place.
It's not like you are making a barbeque.
You just need to add four sticks.
Quickly start the wedding.
Look, I will be starting the wedding
at the said auspicious time.
If you are in a hurry you
can elope and get married.
The marriage will only take place
after I let go of the groom.
You wanted 2 crore rupees as dowry, right?
Now, if you want the groom
back, give me 5 crore rupees.
And listen, if you want to
say something, message me.
Because I don't listen to anyone.
Hey... the groom ran away.
- Let's catch him.
- Yes, let's go.
We will get the ransom money
by day after tomorrow.
Until then, you two take
care of this groom.
- Tiger-bhai, the groom ran away.
- The groom ran away.
- Tiger-bhai!
- Tiger-bhai!
- Tiger-bhai! The groom ran away.
- He ran away.
Tiger-bhai... the groom ran away.
- He ran away.
- Police has come?
- Not the police. The groom ran away.
- He ran away.
The groom ran away and has entered
the wedding take place next door.
- The groom ran away.
- Yes.
Hello.
Hello.
Hello. Look, this is a theme wedding.
Please wear a groom's attire.
Don't worry, we won't leave without eating.
We are from the groom's side.
You didn't get me. You
should change your dress.
You don't understand, papa.
If it gets even a little late
then it will be too late.
Don't worry at all.
- I was talking about something spicy and tangy, right?
- Yes.
Sister-in-law, you should try this.
It is very tasty.
Quickly eat them and then go home.
This wedding will take a while.
We are not in a hurry. We
have a lot of time to spare.
Yes. We will enjoy the entire wedding.
Don't worry. I have
permission till midnight.
Mr. Verma.
This man will be the death of me.
- Shiv!
- Ram! - Kishan!
Sister-in-law! Sister-in-law!
Sister-in-law!
You should try these first!
They are mind-blowing.
I swear they are delicious.
Forget about this. I just
saw Kishan over there.
What are you saying, sister-in-law?
- Yes, and I saw Shiv.
- And I saw Ram.
Oh I understood, sister-in-law.
You are dressed as James Bond..
..but you cannot handle
four glasses on your own.
This is a limit. I'm already so worried..
Okay then, tell me. Where is he?
- He isn't there, right?
- No.
That's it, sister-in-law. This is
happening because of hallucination.
- I am sure you three have studied science.
- No.
Superb. Then you will
understand this even better.
This is what happens during hallucination.
When we love someone from
the bottom of our heart...
His image is so well engraved into our
minds that we see him everywhere.
This is what happens during hallucination.
Okay, tell me, can you see your husband
in the man standing with Deepika?
Yes!
Come on, sister-in-law.
How can you three see Shiv, Ram
and Kishan in the same person?
Look, now look at him again. Do
you see him in that man now?
- No.
- No.
So that's hallucination.
Science is a very complicated thing.
Forget about it. Enjoy the wedding.
Now come on, enjoy these.
I'll go and arrange for some more snacks.
Tell me what will you have?
The one with fritters or the one with curd?
Anyway, I will get both of them.
- Aslam...
- Yes?
Everyone here is dressed as a groom.
How will we find our groom?
Don't use your brains.
Think of a way to find our groom.
Idea.
We'll apply vermillion on everyone's
forehead and look at their faces.
Yes.
Where is he?
Priest, I am the one who
is getting married.
So why are you feeding yourself?
- Watch where you are going!
- You are having 'Laddoos' (SWEETS)?
Deepu has been looking for you.
- Okay.
- Go on now.
And why are you having these 'Laddoos'?
Have you come here to eat these
'Laddoos' or to get them married?
You are strange.
Your three wives are looking for you.
Quickly get married and leave.
Did you hear what I said?
You...
Who was that idiot?
You have already applied it four times.
Brother-in-law, what are
you doing over here!
Are you a wedding guest?
Yes. What brings you here?
I am here for business reasons.
I was holding a groom on ransom.
- But he ran away and came to this wedding venue.
- Oh.
I wonder which idiot
came up with this theme.
Everyone is dressed as a groom.
If I find the person who
came up with this theme...
He will be the first person I'll shoot.
No, brother. A wedding is going
to take place over here.
You should stay calm.
Enjoy yourself a little.
Brother-in-law, you may go.
I will go and find him.
- Okay, brother.
- Go.
Let's go.
Go and stand at the gate, so
that the groom doesn't escape.
Only one wedding is taking place, but
there are many grooms present here.
I think it's time for some fireworks.
Understood?
Everyone come forward for
the garlanding ritual.
Hey!
Here as well?
I think they couldn't get
married in the court.
Have they come here thinking that
a group wedding is taking place?
Bride and groom, exchange
your garlands, please.
Brother?
No one will move.
I am looking for my groom.
Everyone, remove your turbans.
Remove them. Otherwise I will shoot you.
All of you too should remove your turbans.
Are you deaf?
Remove your turban.
Remove it.
Remove it or I will shoot you.
Remove it, son.
- Remove it, Kumar.
- He will shoot you.
- Remove it.
- Remove it.
- Remove it.
- Remove your turban, son.
Remove it or I will shoot you.
Remove it.
- Boss, we found the groom.
- Remove it.
Remove it.
Boss, we found our groom.
Where have you been!
I am very sorry for troubling all of you.
All of you can wear your turbans
now and enjoy the wedding.
Priest, you may begin.
- Let's take him away.
- Let's go.
- You barely escaped, brother.
- Yes.
Priest, why are you wasting our time.
Why don't you put all of it at one go?
Come on...
Bholu!
You?
You are getting married again?
But you already have me.
What are you saying? Not you, he has me.
How does it affect you? He is my husband.
He isn't your husband. He is my husband.
Have you two lost your mind?
- He is my husband.
- What?
Hey! Enough of this nonsense.
You started joking again?
Dear, they are the same three
women who fooled me at the mall.
They said that he is their husband.
Hello. He is my husband, Shiv.
He isn't Shiv. His is Ram, my husband.
No Deepika, I am telling the truth.
- He is my husband, Kishan.
- Shut up.
Have you three lost your mind?
He isn't anyone's Shiv, Ram or Kishan.
He is my Kumar.
Hold on.
Answer the question I ask you in yes or no.
Are the three of them your wives?
- Mother...
- Yes or no.
Yes.
Shameless!
You are already married three times...
And you were about to get
married for the fourth time!
Why didn't you just die before
doing such a shameful deed?
I wouldn't be as sad on
your death as I am now.
You ruined the lives of four girls.
Is this what I taught you?
Is this what I taught?
You remember what I always told you?
Never break a woman's heart.
And never ruin a family!
You broke everyone's trust.
You ruined everyone's life. Everyone's!
Rukmani! That's enough.
Stop it.
I always said that my Bholu is very nave.
But I was wrong.
You are a cheat.
A beguiler.
No, mother.
Your Bholu is not a cheat.
I have not cheated anyone.
Juhi, tell me..
..your father placed your hand in my
hand at the hospital and passed away.
Did he ever ask whether I
already had anyone in my life?
And Anjali, you?
You were going to commit suicide, right?
I saved your life.
Your brother forced me at
gunpoint to get married to you.
Who was the one who cheated?
And Simran, you?
I had told you that my friend fooled
me into getting at the wedding venue.
But you weren't ready to listen to me.
You wanted to jump into the
holy fire and kill yourself.
Should I have left you to die?
How have I cheated you when I
held you hand to save your life?
Yes, I did make one mistake, mother.
I didn't tell these three
of them about each other.
Because if I had told them, then
they would have killed themselves.
Mother, now you tell me, how can I kill
the ones whose lives I have saved?
If there is anyone whom I have
cheated, then that is you, Deepika.
I didn't tell you that I
got married three times.
Now you tell me, what should have I done?
People try to forget tragedies.
But I have been truthfully
living with them.
I didn't want three families.
But I thought if I have
been through tragedies...
Then these three have
also gone through one.
It's not their fault either.
I just wanted one family.
There was just one person that I love.
You, Deepu.
And I didn't want to lose you.
"Never break a woman's heart."
"Never ruin a family."
To keep my promise to you, your Bholu...
Shivram Kishan got divided
into three parts, mother.
I've been running faster than a clock
so that I can give time to everyone.
I have kept everyone happy.
I showed everyone my face
before I left in the morning...
..so that there is a smile
on their face all day.
I tried to keep everyone happy.
Ask them, mother. Ask them.
Have I not been honest in the little
time that I've spent with each of them?
Have I cheated them even a little?
Ask them, mother.
If I would've rejected them
and led my own life...
Then neither you would
have been happy nor God.
If you still feel that I am wrong...
Then you can punish me however you want.
You have given me life.
Even if you wish to take away
that life, I won't say a word.
I won't say a word.
My son.
What have you decided, Deepu?
A person who can love the
tragedies that happened to him...
His love should never
suffer from any tragedy.
This is good, brother.
All four of them stay on separate floors...
But they have accepted each other.
Karan, there is something
that I don't understand.
What happened to me, was
it comedy or a tragedy?
Consider it to be comedy. You
will be able to digest it better.
Anyway, you don't need
to fear anything now.
Everyone knows about your four marriages.
You are right.
But if Tiger-bhai finds out
about it then he will shoot me.
He won't be able to understand the comedy.
Tiger-bhai!
From his forehead I can foretell
that he doesn't listen to anyone.
Even his medical reports say that.
How are you, Tiger-bhai?
- He is Mr. Daruwala.
- Hi.
He will look at your hand tell
us when will you have a kid.
Strange.
In science one can know that
through ultrasonography...
You will tell us just by
looking at his hands?
I am an astrologer. I'll
first tell how good is..
..the relationship between
the husband and wife.
If that is good then only
will they have kids.
Come on, show me your hand.
Oh my God.
What happened? Is this the first time
you are looking at a naked hand?
No, you are destined for four marriages.
Four kids! That great news.
Four marriages.
- It will take four years? Yes. It takes that long.
- Yes.
- I have no problem with it.
- Marriages. Four. Four.
You want 400 rupees? You will get it.
- Take him back to where we got them from.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- You may leave. - He is destined for four marriages.
He doesn't listen to me.
Look, he said that you will have four kids.
But I would still say
that two kids are enough.
He has four wives.
If each wife has two kids, he
will have eight kids for sure.
Not eight, it should take nine
months to deliver a child.
Otherwise the child born is weak.
Have you not studied science?
I think you were on in seven months.
If you had stayed in for
another two months...
..then you would've got
two working ears as well.
You don't need to apologize.
Don't worry. I will bear all
the expenses of your child.
Remember what I had told you?
I am the only uncle, but
I have a lot of desires.
Sir!
Congratulations.
Sir! Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Many, many congrats.
Please have some sweets.
What's the occasion?
He didn't invite me but of course
I'll offer sweets to everyone.
My employer got married
for the fourth time.
She too knows about the four kids?
What? Sir, you have four kids as well?
No, you are misunderstanding him.
Come on, sir! You hid your
wives from everyone...
And you also hid four kids.
Now I will tell everyone.
- Madam! Madam, listen!
- Champa!
- There is good news.
- Have you lost your mind? Listen to me.
He is going with her to
distribute the sweets.
A child does makes you that happy.
When are you getting married?
Brother, I am still just a kid.
I know you are a lawyer.
But you will get married, won't you?
There is a girl whom I
consider to be my sister.
All her talks about marriage
has given me earache.
But look, she too found a groom today.
Really? Who?
You.
Me?
Congratulations.
Saw that? Tragedies can happen to anyone.
Just pray that no one gets
married accidentally.
No harm is done to the other person.
All it takes is a 'Laddoo' (SWEETS).
