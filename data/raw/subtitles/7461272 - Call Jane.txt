We hope all DNC delegates
have enjoyed your stay.
And we look forward
to seeing you next time.
Happy hour for all delegates
has been extended one hour
each night of the convention.
Yo, Bennett, cover that door!
Yippies are rounding
the corner, so hold that line.
Surround the northwest corner.
Step back, ma'am.
Everybody,
we have barricades standing by.
What are they chanting?
Yippie stuff.
We got eyes on them.
They're coming
from the south and the north.
About a block away now.
About 100 feet
off the east corner!
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!
- You all right?
- Hmm. Yes.
Okay. Let's go. Valet's got
the car out back. Hey.
On the ground.
They were barely older
than Charlotte.
Baby, Charlotte's not going
to get mixed up in a riot.
How do you know?
Because she's our daughter.
"The whole world is watching."
That's what they were chanting.
WCHA, Chicago.
I'll, uh...
Okay.
All right, watch your step.
- Thank you.
- Do me a favor.
- Don't be long.
- I'll be quick.
I love you.
- What's that?
- It's an egg.
A square egg?
One of the girls
must have a square egg wig.
I don't get it.
Maybe you have to be
drunk to get it.
It's really funny, Mom.
These rich people from New York
move to this
broken-down farmhouse.
The wife is from a made-up
country and talks really funny.
Hungary is not
a made-up country.
Oh, thank God you know that.
And her hair is beautiful.
You have fun tonight?
Mm.
Small talk with lawyers' wives.
Hotel food.
Endured a cha-cha
with the senior partner.
- Yippie demonstration.
- Huh?
It was... It's a lot of...
It was like a...
You could, like, feel...
a shifting current there.
The cops are
as young as the Yippies.
All right, slowpoke. Come on.
- Oh, Mom.
- It's time.
Erin will fill you in
in the morning.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you for
keeping her indoors.
- Good night, Erin.
- Night.
You okay?
Joy?
Again?
Should you see the doctor?
I see him again next week.
Can you rub my feet?
My ankles are as big as Dumbo's.
- No, they're not.
- Oh, my God.
Just raise it.
You okay to look at
the Kramer brief for me?
Best editor I ever had.
- In college.
- Ever.
Yes, of course, but...
can it wait?
There's something
that can't wait.
Come here.
You should become
partner more often.
Come here.
Talk to you about something.
Oh, yeah.
- Oh, honey?
- Yeah?
Just... the baby.
It's okay.
Doctor said it was fine.
No, I know. It's that... I just...
I feel... I feel huge.
- All right.
- I'm sorry.
No, don't be sorry.
Don't be sorry.
Mm, you know,
it's just that I don't...
I guess I could be convinced
to do something else.
What's that?
When you have a big brain...
- Ah.
- ...why don't you use it?
Oh, I... I think I have an idea.
- It's just that...
- Oh, you do?
Yeah. Yeah.
- You let me know.
- Okay.
So far, I like the idea.
Oh, go easy
while I'm on the job.
It's not a job
if you're not getting paid.
Is that any good?
I wanted to read it
when it came out,
and then, you know, life.
Hmm, I don't know.
Woman cracking up.
- No love, nowhere.
- Group therapy.
It's a Christmas gift
from Roy's mother.
Right?
I mean, your own mother-in-law
giving you a book like this?
What is it?
Beats me.
Doctor's orders.
For when I feel, um...
nothing.
Hmm, I better not.
When Roy died,
people started
looking at me funny.
Cocked their heads,
you know, in the way people do
when they can't
look you in the eye.
Or the way people do
when they think
you might swan dive off
the Wabash Avenue Bridge.
"Oh, Lana..."
is all anyone could manage.
An incomplete thought.
That's me.
Those swan dives.
- Mrs. Griffin?
- Hmm?
Did you go blonde
for Mr. Griffin?
No, but I'm sure it didn't hurt.
Erin and I are gonna do it.
Your hair is beautiful.
Blonde is so much prettier
and cleaner.
My hair looks like dirt.
She won't even let me
get my ears pierced.
I don't want you giving
the impression to people
that you're... fast.
- She's a woman now.
- Hey.
And women make their
own decisions, Mrs. Griffin.
- Shut up.
- Right?
Charlotte.
- You got your period?
- Jesus Christ. Stop it.
Honey!
Why didn't you say something?
That's embarrassing. No, stop.
You know it happens to everyone.
No, I just don't want to talk
about it. Stop. Stop. Shut up.
Did you find the supplies?
Oh my God.
Erin, I'm sure you knew
everything there was to know
when you got yours.
I'm sorry, Erin.
That was very rude.
I had to figure it out
on my own.
My dad had just died on us.
- And then my mom, she...
- No, I know, honey.
I'm... I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.
All right, you put the casserole
on the table
and grab the green beans
for me, Erin.
Something smells good
in here. Hello?
Hello!
- Okay, that's...
- Can we say Grace tonight?
Oh, we only do that when...
- On certain occasions...
- I'd like to tonight. For Erin.
Okay.
Uh... God is good. God is great.
May He bless...
May He bless
this house and the... this food.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
- Amen.
Erin, pass me your dish.
Honey, will you
go get the water?
I forgot the... the water.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I just forgot the water pitcher.
How's your mom doing, Erin?
She's doing good.
That's good. Is that enough?
- Oh, it's terrible. Okay, I...
- ...I knew it.
Well...
I should have
laid off the adjectives.
Baby.
You have not lost your touch.
What you did,
you made me sound like
Clarence Darrow.
- Don't go easy on me.
- I'm not.
- Really?
- Really.
It's beautiful.
Oh, you okay?
I truly don't want
to be the kind of guy
that makes his wife cry.
No, it's the hormones.
Okay.
What are you doing?
Making dinner. Come join me.
That's Lou Reed. No one cooks
to the Velvet Underground.
- Wanna join me?
- Okay.
All right.
Are you all right?
Too old to keep up?
Mom!
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Where is she?
- She's up.
She's...
She's actually doing well.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's okay. She's okay.
- Okay. She's... Okay.
- Uh, Charlotte... Did Charlotte...
- They're up in the cafeteria.
Okay. Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.
- What about the...
Is the baby okay?
Oh, I don't know. I'm sorry.
She's... She's just in there.
Okay. Okay.
Hey.
Mrs. Griffin's cardiomyopathy
of pregnancy
in the first trimester,
it's very rare.
But it is, without question,
the cause
of the congestive heart failure.
Okay, so, uh,
what's the treatment?
To not be pregnant.
And if she weren't,
the condition would
reverse itself over time.
There's...
There's no other treatment?
There's got to be something
we could do, right?
We, um...
We could ask the board
for permission to perform
a therapeutic termination.
What?
That's the only option?
I'm afraid so.
Charlotte's gonna spend
the night at Lana's.
Mm-hmm.
Don't you worry.
You let me do that.
We're gonna be...
I'm gonna make this work.
I still have so much left to do.
The doctor said
there was a chance.
We have to hold on to that.
Why?
We don't have a choice.
Maybe your firm could help us.
They have powerful bosses.
I'm a criminal litigator.
How can I possibly...
I don't cut corners.
I... I'm not a rule breaker.
I... I follow rules. I don't lie.
Will...
How... How did it get to this?
How... How the fuck
did it get to this?!
We do everything right.
I'm not leaving Charlotte.
I want you here
with Charlotte, with me.
Are you kidding me?
But I don't know what...
What do you want me to do?
You know, I...
I wish we still went to church.
Let's check this.
- There we go. Dr. Falk.
- Oh. Hi.
- How are you?
- Good.
Hello. Um, I baked cookies.
Uh, gentlemen,
you're all familiar
with the details of this case.
Mrs. Griffin has
petitioned the board
to make an exception
to hospital policy
so that she might proceed
to an emergency termination
of her pregnancy.
She understands that
this request is extraordinary?
She does, yes.
Is there a chance that
she can survive the pregnancy?
A chance? Of course.
Percentage of patients
who survive a pregnancy
with this condition?
It's difficult to say.
Maybe 50%.
Is there a percentage
that would sway you?
20%, 30%?
This hospital has approved
termination of pregnancy
once in the past ten years.
Was Mrs. Griffin aware of that?
No, she was not.
I'm... I'm here.
I'm... I'm right here.
I am comfortable with the data
compiled in such cases.
Full-term pregnancy resulting
in the birth of a healthy child,
well within reason
for such a patient.
- Therefore, I vote "no"...
- I...
...to the termination.
Gentlemen?
A healthy baby, that's it?
No regard for her mother?
- No.
- No.
- No.
- No.
No.
Excuse me.
So, um...
So, there's always insanity.
If you can convince
two psychiatrists
that you're suicidal,
the hospital
will have no choice.
You'll get your abortion.
Joy... do you think
you might be suicidal?
Yes, Doctor.
I might be.
You know,
shotguns are very long.
You'd have to place
the barrel under your jaw
and pull the trigger
with your toe.
You know, like...
Like Hemingway did.
Yes. Yes, that's...
That's my plan. Mm-hmm.
If the other psychiatrist
doesn't agree,
this is your Plan B.
See you then.
Hi. Come here.
Just fall down a staircase.
It worked for me.
Dr. Campbell's office? Mm-hmm.
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Mom?
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
- What did you do? What did you...
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
I just slipped.
I just slipped.
I just slipped.
I just slipped. I just slipped.
- Are you sure?
- I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
He sees you.
Best not to keep him waiting.
Oh.
Good morning.
I would like to cash this check
for my husband, please.
Of course, Mrs. Griffin.
One moment, please.
Would you like to
recount yourself, Mrs. Griffin?
No. I'm sure it's fine.
Thank you.
Hey!
Playing those games, huh?
It's gettin' time to
get you outta that skirt,
little lady.
Can't let
those legs go to waste, huh?
I'm here for the,
uh, for the service?
Uh, I'm... I'm sorry... I'm sorry.
Looking good!
Where are you going?
How can you do that?
How can you just keep going?
It's what I do.
It's what I've always done.
It's what I will always do.
I don't know how to fix this.
I do.
Hello, this is Jane.
Jane who?
We're a service
for women who are expecting.
- Hello, this is Jane.
- I'm sorry.
Everyone hangs up
the first time.
So, how... how does it work?
- Joy?
- Yes.
Get in.
No, this is not a taxi.
You sit up front with me.
Oh.
Right.
So, uh, you must be Jane?
I'm Gwen.
Oh.
When do I meet Jane?
It's hard to say.
How did you find us?
Bus stop. Wicker Park.
Wicker Park? No kidding.
You got family there?
All right.
Put this on. Cover your eyes.
Can't take any chances.
I got you.
Hold onto my arm.
It's a short walk.
Hey. Careful.
You can take
the blindfold off now.
Thank you.
Don't worry about it,
and I'll take the cash now.
- Thank you.
- Six... Six hundred.
- It's... It's all there.
- I know.
Okay.
I thought about bailing too.
But I didn't.
And he's the best that we have.
A capitalist pig, but still...
You cool with this?
- Yes. Yes.
- Good. Okay.
I'll be right outside that door.
No, you... you...
- You're not gonna stay?
- That's between you and the doc.
Okay.
She's ready.
Just a minute, please.
- What are you doing?
- Oh. It...
- It just... It wasn't tucked.
- Thank you.
But, you know,
someone comes in and does that.
Are you a cop?
- What?
- Please answer the question.
No.
I'm not...
I'm not a cop. No.
Okay. Great.
So, remove your skirt,
your underwear,
put on this smock,
and, uh, lie on the table,
please. Thank you.
Please.
- All right, scooch forward.
- Oh.
There we go.
- Oh. So cold.
- Yeah.
Police have to tell you
they're police
if you ask them directly.
Lean back.
Password?
Sanger.
The password is overkill.
Overkill is keeping
our asses out of jail.
- Uh, it's Joy, right?
- Yes.
Just have a seat right here.
Virginia's making spaghetti.
And there was
going to be a salad,
but my spinach went slimy.
Some women
get the chills afterward,
but it passes quickly.
Okay, this is for your cramps.
- Oh. They're not that bad.
- It gets worse.
So, um,
which one of you is Jane?
Nobody's Jane.
We're all Jane.
Virginia started it.
Help yourself.
Uh, I didn't mean to.
A friend called.
I found her a safe doctor.
And then her friend called,
and then her friend's friend,
and, uh, here we are.
This will get
your blood sugar up,
and then you're gonna rest
for a few hours.
Oh... I'm... I'm...
I'm really... fine.
You're one of those.
One of what?
Uh, I'll-be-home-in-an-hour-
and-I-don't-need-help type.
Um, you could've
used some salt or something.
- You know, it has basil in it.
- There's not enough.
"Hoaxy" is not a word,
you cheating sack of shit.
Where's our dictionary?
You're kidding me, doll.
How do we not have a dictionary?
Because by the time
I finished haggling with the mob
to get a decent rent on
this place and the other place,
and paying for it with money
scrounged from rich ladies,
no offense, Joy,
a dictionary was not a priority.
- Well, excuse me.
- Okay, let's ask Joy.
- Okay.
- Joy. "Hoaxy."
Resembling or pertaining
to a hoax.
That sure is hoaxy.
Come on.
- No. Come on.
- Right. See? No.
All right.
Pregnancy fills you
with hormones.
Over the next few days,
they're going to
leave your body.
You're going to feel
really, really sad.
It's okay. It's normal.
Thank you.
- For everything.
- Eat.
Eat and then sleep
and then scram.
Okay, trust me.
I don't trust you.
Last night I started cramping,
and, uh, I took some
of the pills Dr. Falk gave me.
Um, the cramps were gone
this morning.
But then after lunch,
I went to the bathroom...
and there was... blood.
There was a lot of blood.
It happened very fast.
I lost the baby, Charlotte.
She's in heaven.
Don't say that.
Sweetheart, it's only natural
to feel this way...
Stop that!
Stop telling me how to feel.
Leave her be.
Miscarriage?
I'd like to talk to the doctor.
I'm so sorry, Will.
It's not your fault.
It's nobody's fault.
Have some of that, all right.
Help with the... pain.
A man who has spent years...
I got it.
Hello?
Yeah, hold on one sec.
It's Fran from the PTA.
- Hello?
- How's the bleeding?
Remember,
if it's stopped already,
it will start again.
Soon.
Well, say something.
It's Virginia.
Uh, yes. Uh, I know.
We do our first checkup call
on day three.
What, is he
standing right there?
Uh, well, I agree
that the playground
needs to be remodeled.
I just don't think a bake sale
is gonna raise enough funds.
Ooh, you are good at that, Joy.
You got potential.
So, are you taking
your antibiotics?
- Of course.
- Any chills? Fever?
No, he's gone.
I want to be sure you're healing
on schedule and coping.
Uh, I... I think I am.
How will I know?
Well, you can't, but you'll know
when you're better.
So, listen,
I know it's short notice,
but, um,
since you're feeling okay,
I got a bit
of an emergency down here.
Our morning driver came down
with food poisoning,
and it's a mess.
I got a girl waiting
not far from you.
Can you pick her up
and run her in?
No, that...
That's not a good idea.
You do have a car,
right? Hubby takes the L?
Well, he... he does, but...
Onetime deal. Drop her off.
Never hear from us again.
Virginia, I am...
Thanks. You are a lifesaver.
Gwen's gonna call
with instructions.
No. I...
All right.
Did you take a bite out of this?
No.
I hope the doctor is handsome.
Does it matter?
It's kind of
embarrassing, the whole thing.
So it might as well be
something to look at.
Wouldn't it be funny if I fell
in love with my abortion doctor?
I'm supposed to collect the fee.
Oh, right.
Only date men with money.
He was my boss
at the bank. He's married.
I asked him to pull out,
but I don't think they can
at a certain point, can they?
He said, "I'll take care of it."
And he did.
Have you ever done this?
No.
You're very tightly wound, Joy.
- It's a lot of money.
- Not as much as having a baby.
Virginia ran out
of our activist dykes?
I'm doing her a favor.
We've met, actually.
I'm Joy.
Right. Sure. Yeah.
I had a slightly different view
last time. Excuse me.
I'll just have you lie down
for a while.
Well done, Jackie O.
I'm sorry if that wasn't
the morning you expected.
You read my mind, doll.
Mmm-mmm-mmm. I'm trying to quit.
Why?
Maybe I wanna sing opera
for my next life.
We have organizing meetings
on Thursdays.
That's the address.
I don't agree with
what you're doing.
That girl...
What about her?
She's having sex
without protection.
She's sleeping with
a married man
who paid for the procedure.
- She's so...
- ...unconcerned.
We help women.
We don't ask questions.
And if we judged everyone
by how they present themselves,
I might write you off
as a lightweight housewife
who bakes
mediocre snickerdoodles
and gets plastered
on four o'clock martinis.
It's chocolate chip, usually.
Thanks for helping out.
I really do appreciate it.
I make the best coffee.
Well, well, well.
Look what the Sister dragged in.
Cookies! Thank Christ!
Are those snickerdoodles?
Uh, they're not my specialty,
but I had a request.
We were just about
to start the cards. Have a seat.
- How you doing? Okay?
- Mm. Yes. I... Yeah.
My husband offered me ice.
- Oh, God. Ice.
- Take it away, Maeve.
Uh, Joanne, 29.
LMP eight weeks ago.
She has the money,
but she's got Catholic guilt.
Um, Millie, 32.
She's got three kids
and can't handle another one...
This is you, Liz.
Uh, and she's on blood thinners
for a congenital heart defect.
Uh-huh.
I will ask Dean
what he thinks. I'll take it.
Um, we have Rose, age 31.
LMP five weeks.
Um, she's in Forest Park,
and she has 200 dollars.
You have a daughter?
Yes. Uh, my pride and joy.
Charlotte. She's 15.
Well, the service is
my daughter.
And I don't trust her
with just anyone.
Are you just anyone?
Because I don't need tourists.
I don't need
some housewife on a guilt trip
snitching to the cops.
Are you a snitch?
No.
Hey.
- Hi.
- Where you been?
Art class at
the community college.
Uh, yeah, I... I told you.
It's been so good for me, Will.
I... I forgot
how much I love to paint.
I'm not so hot at it,
but it keeps me active.
And, uh, you know,
it keeps my mind off of...
You wore a good dress
to an art class?
They have smocks.
How was your day?
Uh...
the Kramer case is killing me.
Barry's up my ass
to put in even more hours,
and I come home
to an empty house, and...
...don't know where anyone is
or what they're doing.
And I'm sick of frozen meatloaf.
We have it three days a week
because my wife
goes to art class.
I...
I need to be
with other people...
who think and do.
I'll make you a drink.
How about a Manhattan?
Sure.
You don't have to
tell my mom, right?
That's between you and your mom.
- It was my first time.
- I should hope so.
I didn't even know
I could get pregnant like that.
I mean, we were standing up.
I just don't really know
how everything works down there.
Joy, you must have
explained this to your daughter.
Want to take a stab?
Oh, uh... Well, uh...
Izzie, uh,
you...
- You have...
- ...a vagina...
Okay, just hold it. Hold this.
Okay.
Here is your vulva.
This is the labia.
Inside here is the vagina.
This is the vaginal canal.
That looks like a rabbit.
Above that is your cervix
and your uterus.
These are the ovaries.
- That's where the eggs are.
- Mm.
Please tell me you at least know
what the clitoris is.
She knows.
No, no.
Uh...
Joy?
What?
This girl is shaking
like a poodle at the groomer.
I can't give her her shots.
She's so jumpy.
Can you help out?
Please.
- It's Marion.
- Thank you.
Marion.
I can't do this. I can't.
- I know I need to, but...
- I know. I was so scared too.
You did this?
I did. Well, Dr. Dean did.
- Yeah.
- Did it hurt?
It did. But you know what?
It was over in 20 minutes.
Twenty minutes out of all
the minutes of your whole life.
You can do anything
for 20 minutes, can't you?
Okay.
And... And I'll stay here
with you. Is that okay?
As long as you can
keep her steady.
I can do that. Okay.
Twenty minutes,
then we're going for spaghetti.
Okay?
Hey, stranger.
You're starting early.
No time like the present.
Come join me?
Oh, I can't.
Uh, art class.
I've... I've just been so busy.
What's really going on with you?
Nothing I can't handle.
Okay.
You know where I am.
Come find me if you need me.
Six hundred dollars?
Is there anything
you can sell, Mrs. Burr?
I don't think so.
My husband would notice.
Is there any other option?
A payment plan or something?
- Maybe...
- Uh...
I'm... I'm sorry.
You'll get used to it.
They borrow, beg,
sell everything they have,
tap the boyfriend.
- How can Dean charge so much?
- Because he can.
- We should be able to help her.
- We should.
But we can't help
anybody who can't pay.
Do you smoke?
Everybody smokes.
Puff, puff, pass, Joy.
This is so good.
I'm gonna send you back
to your old man high as hell.
I miss you.
Just give me a second
to wake up.
- Lana?
- Hi.
Uh, Joy's...
She's still not home.
I made an extra
and I figured, "What the hell."
I was just gonna put it
in the freezer anyway,
but you and Charlotte are
probably hungry for home cooked.
So pop it in the oven at 350.
- Just... Just pop it in there.
- Oh, my gosh.
You've never even opened
an oven, have you?
Let me show you
how to warm it up.
Okay.
So, we're set.
Dad, you want to help?
Oh, no, honey,
I've got it under control.
Now, where does your mom
keep the good china?
You know,
we only use that on holidays.
Oh, I use mine every day.
It makes me feel,
I don't know, rich.
It's silly, right?
Yeah.
No, not at all.
In fact, Charlotte,
let's use
the good china tonight.
- Every day is a holiday.
- Yeah. That's the spirit.
- Where is it, honey?
- The dining room.
Can you go get it?
Why not?
- Thank you so much for this.
- Anytime.
Lynette, 40. LMP ten weeks.
She has 37 dollars.
- Next card.
- This is bullshit.
Well, these women need our help
just as much as
the ones with money.
We can't change
what it costs, Joy.
It's economics.
It's interesting how economics
always seems to mean
that Black women get screwed.
We're screwing
plenty of white women,
if that makes you
feel any better.
Please, can we not
make this about race.
Look around the room, Virginia.
We are a bunch of
white ladies. Yes.
You know, that's not the intent.
I don't care about intent.
I care about results.
You did not try hard enough
with the Panther Sisters.
And then you insulted
the Black Feminist Alliance.
They were batshit,
screaming at me about abortion
and Black genocide...
They are not batshit.
God, I knew
you would do this. I just...
How can you still be
so oblivious?
Black genocide,
that is not batshit!
I should not have
used that word.
How dare you!
Come on, Gwen.
We fucking marched together
in Memphis.
Oh, here we go again.
Well, I don't know
what to do about this.
What do you want me to do?
Pay for every
Black woman's procedure myself?
Why not? Go for it.
- Liar. Drink.
- Give me a break.
Wouldn't you rather me
take off my belt? Huh?
- Drink.
- All right. To you.
Mmm. Mmm.
- Whoo!
- Your turn.
How old are you?
You sly son of a bitch. Hmm...
Good. Take off your shirt.
You don't get to tell me
what to take off.
That's not how
the game is played.
You know,
you're a real ballbuster.
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.
- Okay, my turn.
- Okay.
- Um, what's your IQ?
- One eighty-four.
- Huh? Really?
- Mm.
Is that the Stanford-Binet
or the Wechsler test?
- You liar!
- Goddamn it.
You know, let's stop, uh, flying
through all the questions. Yeah?
How about, uh,
let's take everything off
and watch you admire me.
You know, besides, older broads
really do it for me.
Oh. Good to know, Dean.
- Uh-huh.
- Good to know.
- Oh my God.
- I'm all yours.
- Put him away.
- Okay.
Yeah.
Why don't you tell me
what you want?
- A favor.
- Mm-hmm.
I know you came down
by a hundred.
It's still out of reach
for a lot of women.
Will you give it a rest, please?
Seven years in med school.
Do you know what that costs?
I support my mother and the mob.
I mean, they're
gouging me for their cut.
- I'm making peanuts as it is.
- What if you made more money?
I'm listening.
What if we guaranteed you
ten procedures a week?
Every week.
- At my full rate?
- At your full rate.
And every week,
you do two for free.
One, and you take off
your panties. I won't look.
I just want to know
that they're off.
Two, and I'll take off
my blouse right now.
Are you wearing a bra?
- It's a deal.
- Okay.
- Now we got a party, huh?
- Hmm.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Oh yeah! Turn around!
Turn around! Hey! Hey...
Hey... Oh, come on!
You said you weren't
wearing a bra.
I'm not. I'm not.
Deal's a deal, Dean.
I took off the blouse.
Go fuck yourself.
Good night, Deano.
Take the vodka with you.
- Good deal.
- You're unbelievable.
Two for free every week.
That's the deal.
- What's the catch?
- There's always a catch.
We find more women who can pay.
- And sisters get priority?
- That's the idea.
Yes.
That's it.
Great.
I need to use the bathroom.
Can you handle the Ergotrate?
Mm, just like
you taught me last time.
- Yes?
- Great. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, Judith, one more shot.
Well, this one...
is gonna keep you
from bleeding too much.
- I hate shots.
- Oh, we all do.
The good news is this one
just goes in your thigh. Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.
Okay. Take a deep breath.
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.
And exhale.
- That's it.
- I... I didn't even feel it.
Okay.
Dr. Dean is
gonna dilate you now.
Thank you.
I need to dilate your cervix
before the extraction
can begin, okay?
We're halfway through.
- Okay.
- Okay.
It's kind of a shame.
You got a knack for this.
Could've been a nurse.
I could've been a doctor.
It might not be a bad idea
if you started assisting more.
I mean...
maybe if a lady was helping,
they wouldn't all tense up
so much, you know.
- Well, what do you think?
- It's a great view.
Okay. Give me five years
for the corner office.
It's... It's got
a spectacular view.
Open it.
- What?
- Mm-hmm.
What do we got here?
I just felt like
you deserve a non-frozen meal.
- Wow, babe, wow.
- Mm-hmm.
And you know
I'm lousy at Italian, so...
You're not lousy
at Italian, but...
Yeah, but I don't
do those meatballs
like they do the meatballs.
Come here.
- Honey, the door.
- It's fine.
It's locked.
How's art class goin'?
Oh, ah, goodness.
So much work.
Ah, but it's wonderful.
How come
you never bring anything home?
Oh, honey, I...
Nothing I paint is worth
bringing home. Believe me.
Well, maybe I'd like one of
your paintings for my room.
I mean, it's okay
if you don't want to.
Thank you
for making me feel like Picasso.
Don't push it, Mom.
I want to learn
the entire procedure.
You're gonna teach me.
Sure. Yeah, why not?
Maybe after that,
you can ask someone else
to teach you open-heart surgery,
brain surgery, you know?
Sure, why not?
Do you think just anybody
can pick it up on a whim?
Well, you obviously did.
Because you're not a doctor.
You want me
to show you my medical degree?
- Well, that would be a trick.
- Excuse me?
The university has no record
of you ever attending
medical school there,
which makes sense
when you think about it.
Why would a real doctor
risk his medical license
performing illegal abortions
out of a run-down apartment?
Hey!
I keep a very pristine shop.
Thank you very much.
Maybe I care about
the women, huh?
You ever think about that?
If that were true,
you would charge a lot less.
My fee is entirely reasonable.
You have a swimming pool.
I'm the best you've got.
Don't make me tell Virginia
you're not a real doctor.
You're going to teach me...
please.
Please.
Lesson one.
You ever scoop seeds
out of a pumpkin?
Uh, sure.
It's like that.
For most of the procedures
that I do.
...age 35 in Chicago...
Are we havin' a party?
A bake sale. Uh... you know.
Did you make extra for us?
Sure. Yes. Let's...
I'll get you a plate.
Okay, terrific.
They look delicious.
Okay, one more shot.
This is to keep you
from bleeding too much.
It's a nice, easy one.
- Ready?
- Hmm.
Okay, let's take a deep breath.
Breathe in... and out.
That's it.
It takes a minute to kick in.
Come here.
- Like that?
- Mm-hmm.
Don't make me regret this.
It's not that hard, Virginia.
I could do it myself.
You could do it.
What are you smoking?
We're not doctors, Joy.
- Neither is Dean.
- What?
Oh, shit. Oh, I promised
I wasn't gonna tell you that.
- Holy shit.
- It's not rocket science.
It's a 20-minute procedure
that a man with
no medical training
taught himself.
- Safer than a tonsillectomy.
- Which is done by a surgeon.
We could do this.
We could do
the procedures for free.
No. No way. It's too risky.
We take on risk
every time we answer that phone.
No, we minimize risk.
We're careful.
We pay off the right monster.
So you think it's an accident
we haven't been busted?
You're right.
But we are entirely dependent
on one man who is not a doctor.
If I were to let you do this
and you screwed up one time,
if even one woman
died on our watch,
I mean, think about that.
Not to mention,
it's felony homicide.
Okay?
I'm not scared of jail, Joy.
I've been to jail.
I'm scared there won't be
anyone left to answer the phone.
It's supposed to be
a shepherd's pie,
but it's more like
hamburger noodles.
Mmm, it's delicious, Char.
- Don't you think so, Joy?
- Mm-hmm. Perfection.
I tell you what, I wish...
I wish I learned to make
hamburger noodles in school.
I don't think
you mean that, Will.
You're saying it to be nice,
and it is nice.
And it's also true
that it tastes good.
But...
we're pretty sure you don't wish
you'd learned it in school.
Because as a man,
Home Ec would have been
a waste of your time.
You had, um, wrestling shop
and grooming for law school,
which is fantastic.
But our daughter's spending
her school hours
learning what order
to do the dishes in.
Did something happen today?
Something upsetting?
No. I had a great day.
I like Home Ec.
So did I,
but that's not my point.
Uh, in case there's any doubt,
I'd like to
go on record and say...
women can be
whatever they want to be.
As long as you don't have
to eat too many TV dinners.
- Okay, that's not fair. Come on.
- I totally agree.
I'm gonna heat up
the pumpkin pie. All right?
Just get it in the oven.
What are you laughing at?
Oh.
These are the people
who can pay.
And these are the people
who cannot pay.
We need an answering machine.
Or I don't know what.
I mean, there are only
two free a week.
How are we going
to get through them all in time?
How are we gonna decide
who gets the freebies?
Oh, this one. We have to do her.
She was raped.
All of the free slots have gone
to rape victims lately.
- So what?
- I mean, is that it?
Is that the deciding factor?
If you were raped,
you get a free slot?
Are you saying
they don't deserve the slots?
Of course not.
I'm saying that this
11-year-old girl deserves it.
Oh, my God.
And this mother of eight
who's being evicted deserves it.
She was raped.
Okay, I can't have this fight.
Well, this lady has cancer
and she can't continue her chemo
while she's pregnant.
- Yeah, that's noble.
- I vote for Rita.
She's finishing her dissertation
on homelessness
in American cities.
Think of the good she could do.
- She was raped!
- Okay.
This is just fucked up. I mean,
at least before we just got rid
of everybody who couldn't pay.
Look, it has to be random.
We are not making
value judgments
about these women.
- That's not how we work.
- That's bullshit!
It's life or death
for some of them.
It's life or death
for all of them.
You get one shot.
Have you seen my keys?
Why are you so jumpy?
I'm not.
It's Sunday. Relax.
Did your father
happen to mention
when he's coming back from golf?
Okay, where are you going?
Well, I told you, honey,
a few of us from art class
are meeting up to,
um, do a life study.
You said lunch before.
Then why did you ask?
All right,
I'll see you this afternoon.
Spaghetti for dinner.
Prepare a hot bath
in a shallow pan
to sterilize the instruments.
Where's Joy?
Ay, ay, ay.
It's 11:20. Do you...
Do you think she chickened out?
I will beat her to death
with a rolling pin.
Should I call Dean?
We thought you got cold feet.
Oh, ye of little faith.
Hope you've had your coffee.
Where's the doctor?
You've got to be kidding me.
It wasn't some
kind of statement.
She was just the next card.
Karma.
Thank you.
I remember you.
I remember you too.
For the bleeding.
I want to be a mom someday.
You will be. Just not today.
All right.
I'm gonna dilate you now,
which means opening the cervix,
so I can perform the extraction.
Are you really
doing this yourself?
Yes, but you know what?
This is the first time
I've done it alone.
You understand that, right?
Who was your
first-grade teacher, Sandra?
I don't...
I can't remember. Um...
Oh, I think she was...
Miss Milligan.
What did she look like?
Uh, she had gray, curly hair,
like little tight curls that
looked like a helmet.
And all of her sweaters
were green.
No kidding.
How are you doing?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
- Just relax.
Breathe.
I'm gonna use the curette now.
You'll feel some pressure.
Uh, how do you know
where everything is?
I can't see it, so I visualize
what I know is there,
and then I feel for it.
Here we go.
Deep breaths.
He notices me.
He makes me feel so... fine.
He says if I love him,
I'll sleep with him.
And if I don't,
it's the worst bummer.
And I want him to love me,
but he just gets what he wants
and he walks away.
I'm so stupid.
You are not stupid, sweetheart.
But he sounds like a jackass.
I'll go.
It's okay.
It's okay. You're doing great.
I was... There's a... I'm just
setting up the life model.
I told her.
You got there all...
All by yourself?
I know how to use
public transportation.
It's not hard.
And you wrote down
the address in your planner.
I thought that you
might be having an affair.
What? Oh, God. No.
No. Never, Char. Never.
I wish you were.
I will answer any questions.
I don't have any questions.
I don't want to know.
It's just... I don't want
to know about babies dying,
or people getting shot,
or periods, or Vietnam.
It's an answering machine,
so we don't miss
a single message.
This thing is cutting edge.
I told Dean
we don't need him anymore.
You what?
Yeah. You know,
I have devoted
a lot of my life to causes.
You name the cause, I was there.
Marches,
protests, sit-ins, and mostly,
it was a bunch of guys screaming
Marxist theory at each other
on the steps of City Hall
drowning all the women out.
We did not have a voice.
Turns out, the rats are
bigger pigs than the pigs.
Do you think you can handle
20 procedures this week?
- Yes.
- Yes?
Yes!
Okay.
So, tell me
how you ladies came to be...
Jane.
Joy.
My wife's name
is Joy, Detective.
Yeah, you told me that.
But a person contains...
multitudes.
Isn't that right, Joy?
Maybe.
Like you.
- Hmm?
- How?
- Vice.
- Hmm.
Radicals.
- Addicts.
- Hmm.
You see, I enjoy the variety.
And these threads? Just a means
to gettin' the job done.
A mask, right?
You wear a mask,
don't you, Joy?
And we have a mutual friend.
Helen Burr.
No, I... I...
I don't know
anyone named Helen Burr.
Well, my old pal Carl,
he's married to Helen.
He gives me a call.
He says that
she contacted you ladies
for a you-know-what.
And it didn't work out.
Couldn't afford you.
Now, Helen,
she's a... good lady.
She didn't give up any names,
so nothin' except
that it wasn't... your fault.
You see, she...
stuck somethin' up her privates,
somethin' that
didn't belong there.
So she ended up in the hospital.
Almost died.
I don't know
anything about that.
Sure. I didn't think you did.
But there's this doctor
over at the hospital, Falk?
Yeah,
he's my wife's obstetrician.
He also happens to be
my brother-in-law.
So, if I hypothetically
ask him to say
that one of his patients
is up to somethin' shady,
somethin' that almost got
another one
of his patients killed...
Look, officer, my wife has not...
Has gotten so much
as a traffic ticket.
I assure you,
she would never involve herself
in something like this.
Well, that's too bad.
This woman...
is going to call Jane,
and Jane will provide her
with a service.
She's a friend of mine.
Lots of cops have friends,
you understand?
Look, Detective, my wife,
she doesn't know anything
about this, okay?
There's a fee.
- Five hundred, right?
- Six hundred.
Just make sure that...
Jane gets this message.
Thank you, Mrs. Griffin.
Oh, no. No.
I can see myself out.
Is there any point
in me asking questions,
or you're just gonna lie?
Ask me whatever you need to ask.
You...
arrange illegal abortions?
- Safe abortions.
- Oh, I don't even know...
I don't even know.
Do you want to end up in prison?
- No, of course not.
- Joy, this is...
You're an accessory
to multiple crimes.
Maybe I think
we could get you immunity
by giving up the name
of the doctor who does the...
I can't.
Why the hell not?
Why not?
Because...
I'm the doctor.
I'm the doctor.
You're operating on people?
It's not... It's...
It's not an operation.
It's... It's a simple procedure.
Joy, what are you doing?
You're operating on people?
- I had to.
- How fucking stupid can you be?
I had to. I...
You should have stopped, Mom.
I told you that.
You dragged our daughter
into this?
You don't even see me.
You don't pay attention!
Charlotte. Charlotte!
Charlotte? Charlotte!
She's at Lana's.
Virginia, it's Joy.
Would it be all right if...
If Charlotte stays the night?
Yeah. Of course.
They're fine up there.
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about it.
We can talk about it
if you want.
It's not...
You think
you're in control of your life,
and...
just like that,
you realize that you're not?
When Roy's boss called to
tell me about the heart attack,
and that there was nothing
anyone could do...
...I remember staring
at the wallpaper thinking...
it just looked like
it was melting.
Like the entire house
was just...
falling to pieces.
There's no worse feeling
in the world.
So whatever you're
going through, I'm...
sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm...
I'm so sorry.
What am I doing? I'm so sorry.
No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
No, no, no.
Why... Why are you sorry?
I'm the one...
I'm the one who did it.
I... I don't know.
It's because I... It's what I do.
I apologize.
I've always done it.
I... I will always do it.
Forgive me.
Please.
Charlotte needs you.
I need you.
Will... I... I need
to tell you something.
No. You don't.
Nixon won.
He did?
Mm-hmm. They called it
about an hour ago.
I voted for him.
Roy would have
voted for him, so...
I meant to vote for Humphrey.
But I forgot.
You're a Democrat?
Don't tell Will.
I'll break it to him gently
one day.
I... I really wish
that I had been, um,
helping you through this,
you know, this whole time?
I don't know,
with the pliers and wrenches,
instead of being wrapped up
in my own...
It's okay.
It's okay.
Thank you for saying that.
But there's no need. I...
Did you say pliers?
Seriously?
What are you doing? Huh?
What I'm supposed to be doing.
You know what happens to
pregnant women over time, right?
They get more pregnant.
Charlotte, go to Erin's, please.
Why? I already know everything.
The kid's right, you know?
We have something that works.
We are of use.
Yeah, it's not perfect,
but it works.
And since you just stopped
answering your phone,
I have a hundred women lined up,
waiting for the doctor,
and you're it.
You're all I have.
You are all we have.
Come on. You can't just garden
and go to your PTA meetings.
That's not the Joy I know.
Oh, here,
so you know exactly
who you are walking out on.
I'm sorry about the '60s, kid.
Hello, is this Jane?
I need help. Please.
I don't know what to do.
I have 43 dollars.
This is my fourth message...
I'm losing my grip. I thought
you were supposed to help.
Hello? Um,
my friends gave me this number.
I'm... I'm 15.
I'm from Riverside.
I... I took two buses
to get to Chicago.
I'm staying at the Travel Lodge
on Roosevelt.
Um, room 116.
I... I can't tell my parents.
I'm... I'm alone here.
Mom?
You have to go back.
- Hello?
- Mm-hmm. Got it.
I found this one guy
who can do 800 dollars,
but he has
a terrible bedside manner.
- But he's never lost anyone.
- Okay, that's a start.
Good work. Yep.
The Baptist ministers
are running
a network up in New York.
I think we can send
some people north.
It will cost more
with the train ticket.
Wonderful.
Lateral thinking.
I love it. Keep it up.
You're back... with a pumpkin.
I'm going to teach you.
Anybody who wants to learn.
And I'll stay
as long as it takes
to make you as good
as anyone can be.
And then I'm going
to leave you to it.
I will raise as much money
as I can to keep you going,
to keep you safe.
Because that's what
I can do for you,
in return for all
that you have done for me.
And as it turns out,
I know plenty
of stuffed shirts with money.
Okay?
Let's get to work.
We performed almost
12,000 procedures
in the years before the raid.
We didn't lose a single woman.
Not one. Let that sink in.
You know who made that possible?
You... and you...
and even you. All of you.
But there was one of you
who was courageous enough
to take us right off the map...
...and show us
what we were capable of.
Who knew that we could
get this done ourselves?
And we did.
And yeah, she also bailed us out
and never gave up the fight
to clear our names.
And yeah,
she happens to be married
to one hell of a criminal lawyer
who got us out of hot water
and helps her smooth talk
a lot of old capitalist bastards
into parting with their cash.
And I think he'd tell you
the same thing I'm telling you.
He's lucky to have
Joy Griffin by his side.
And so are we.
And you know what?
Thank God for those seven men
on the Supreme Court, right?
The other two? Fuck 'em.
God, did I ever think
I would publicly thank
seven men for anything?
Anyway, we did it all
because you showed us we could.
You know, this is a...
a strange occasion.
We are shutting down
because we're redundant.
And I could not be happier.
So...
this is goodbye.
But also, I hope hello...
to new battles, right?
And now I would
very much like you to
burn the first card, kiddo.
I'd be honored.
Geraldine T., 15.
Sally, LMP eight weeks.
- So, what's next on our list?
- Oh.
Pay parity? The ERA?
Equal pay.
Piece of cake after this, right?
It's gonna be.
I mean, nothing could be harder
than this, right?
Right?
Let's go make some trouble.
You got it, Jackie O.
Leticia, 14.
Kate, 30.
LMP eight weeks.
Sally Anne, age 25.
LMP four weeks.
Age 19. LMP nine weeks.
Allison, 29.
LMP six months critical.
