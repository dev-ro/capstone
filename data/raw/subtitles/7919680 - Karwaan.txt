Careful, mister!
Will you take us to Godbefore we get to the temple?
Bus travels are no less tediousthan a pilgrimage.
Are you a writer?
Is this your first timeto Gangotri?
No.
I hear it's beautiful.
It's the sourceof the river Ganges.
No. Actually...
it begins from Gaumukh.
Nineteen kilometers aheadof Gangotri.
Really?
I had no idea.
I'll surely visit and thengo see my daughter.
My daughter stays in Kerala.
I have a granddaughter too.
She's very smart.
Tanya.
Your family?
Family?
I have a son.He's in Bangalore.
Really?
I hear Bangalore's nice.
Is he married?

Shall we get a beer?
Where have you been?
The office keeps me busy, so...
When's your next show?
We have the venue...

When you first exhibited,we were just starting out.
Let me know...
if you have new photographs,I'll set up a date for you.
Photography?
Start playingthe traditional drums, too.
Offer a package deal for weddings.
Avinash?
Just give me a date.
I've given up photography.

But sir, if you've downloadeda pirated version of our software,
it can't be covered under warranty.
Pirated or not...it's still your software.
But, how can we guaranteepirated software?
I don't care.
Your software, your responsibilty...now give me a solution!
I'm sorry, sir.We can't do anything.
Next time, buy the original.
Hey, mister.
I can sue you.
Unbelievable!
You've committed a crimeand you'll sue us?
My uncle's a senior lawyer.
-Wait and see what I can do.-Yeah, we'll see.
Is this our customer-relations policy?
-Sir, he wasn't a customer.-Company guidelines... number 14.
He who isn't already a customer,is a potential one.
Sir, he's...
It's protocol to speakto a customer politely.
Now I understand why we getso many complaints.
You aren't interested in the job at all.
-Sir, it's not that...-Really?
Why didn't yesterday's reporthave the cover sheet?
Sir, the cover sheet is pointless.It's a waste of paper.
And you're a waste of space!
Don't forget that you're herebecause of my dad.
He held you in high regard.
I don't know why.
But if you want to continue working here,then pull up your socks, dammit.
Sir, there's a call from theservice provider.
Buddy, we're an IT companyand our internet's always down.
What's the problem?Is this a joke?
I've told you a hundred timesto get this problem fixed.
Okay?Problem... fixed!
Get it?
What is this?
Every month we have the same complaint.We are an IT company...
Our WiFi is shit!
I'm Amey, by the way.
Hi... Avinash.
Why didn't yougive it back to him?
He can't multitask.He can either listen or understand.
Are you happy with this job?
I've made my peace.Are you happy here?
-Actually... I've just joined.-I've got my answer. Coffee?
So...
-Goodnight.-Thank you.
Hello?
Hello. Sir, I'm callingfrom Aaja Travel.
Can I speak to Mr. Avinash?
Speaking.
How is Mr. Prakash Rajpurohitrelated to you?
He's my father.
Sir, your father is dead.
What?
He booked a tourwith our company.
That bus met with an accident.Extremely sorry for your loss, sir.
Mr. Avinash?
Yeah?
Your father had listed youas an emergency contact.
We've sent the body to youat our expense.
It should reach your local airportby tomorrow.
Collect it from there.
The cargo bill numberwill be sent to you via SMS.
Can I confirm the number?
9845373547?
Yes, but...
Thank you for your time.
Hello?
Hello, sir.This is your friend, Ranjan.
What's your dream destination?
I just got a call from someonefrom your office.
She mentioned a bus accident...
That's why I recommend flying.
I'll offer you reasonable packagesto the Far East.
Awesome places, sir.So... shall I book it?
Listen to me.
Let me speak to the ladyI had spoken to earlier.
Sir, this is the company's call center.
There are thousands of employees here.
What was the lady's name?
Name...
I'm sorry I don't know.
A bus to Gangotri has metwith an accident...
Sir, I handle bookings.
I'll transfer your callto customer service.
Please hold.
Have you no ambition?
Arts students just talkabout changing the world.
Live a pauper's lifeoff their parents' money.
And they consider it a revolution.
Bloody frauds!
Shastri uncle has offered you a job.
People die to workin the IT sector.
Just accept it.
They buried us alive,to destroy us.
Little did they knowthat we are seeds.
Our burial is our redemption.
And love, don't be in such a hurryto bear fruit.
You haven't come of age.
You'll be taken to a bigger space...
and you can spread your wings there.
Alright?
Shaukat...
Shaukat.
Buddy, what a surprise!
All okay?
My father's no more.
(Prayer) We belong to the Almightyand to him we shall return.
But... how?
Accident.
He was goingfor a pilgrimage and...
He went to visit the Almighty...and He kept him forever!
Buddy, it'll be okay.
Don't cry.You're a brave child.
May you find the strength.
I'm... I'm fine.
We're both orphans now.
But remember one thing, Avinash.
I'll never let you feelyour father's absence.
For now,I don't need a dad.
I need your van.
His body will beat the airport tomorrow.
I want to borrow your van.
What's to ask?
I've never even met my dad.
Your dad goneis like my dad's gone.
And why just the van,I'll come, too.
I've never even met him.
Sir, please hurry up.
I've been waitingfor a while.
I'm working, too.Just a minute.
Doesn't seem like it.
Sorry... sorry.
Bye.
Name?
Avinash Rajpurohit.
Reference number?
-SAPB... 3212.-SAPB...
Hey...
get coffin number two.
Rascals spendall their time on their phones.
Identity card.
Why?
We need photo identification.
What if you're a thiefand sell off a kidney?
Here's my driving license.
Must say,you've lost a lot of weight.
Are you following a diet?
Can I please take the coffin?
What should we do?
I'm not keen ona prayer meeting or ceremonies.
No one knows him here.
True.
There's an empty plotbehind the service station.
It's a perfect spot to bury him.
What rubbish?
Why not?
I'll vouch for it.
He'll chill there.
We can even keep an eye on him.
We cremate the dead.
What the...
You guys torch the body.
Alright.Wood it is, then.
Should we burn him there?
There's some diesel, too.
I'm not particularly close to him.
But, the last rites...should be done right.
Fine.
I wanted to make an inquiry.
Where's the closestelectric crematorium?
Can't we see the body burn?
No, sir.
So, how does one feel the loss?
It's quite a lame system.
What the...
Now I get why you wantedto torch the body.
What?
I didn't know this side of you?
-What do you mean?-You'll be cursed by the dead.
How much for a kidney?
I have no clue what you're saying.
Really? You don't?Come.
Is this your dad?
Sir, shall we proceed?
You've given me the wrong body.
-It's your fault!-No... yours!
You should've checkedbefore leaving.
Before you leave a store,don't you check your cart?
The coffin was sealed.The paperwork was right.
You guys messed upsuch an important delivery!
Mess up?
We haven't messed up anything.
And listen... our cargo companyis the best.
Your goods have reached you.Now, leave.
What do you mean he's busy?It's urgent.
Now, who the hell is this?
-Yes? What's the problem?-Where's my sister's stuff?
How the hell should I know?And who are you?
I'm Latha Nambiar's brother.
Now, who the hell is that?
My sister.What a question...
Look, my sister died in a bus accident.
Sir, I have your sister...
I mean... her body.
But the travel agency said thatthey couldn't find her body.
Just some personal effects.
Oh. I have an entire body...
-What nonsense is this?-Exactly.
Please calm down,both of you.
Enough!
Both of you... sit!
And give me the reference code.
Damn the reference code.
FLPM7818.I know it by heart.
That's it!
Both of you will remain calm.
[Alone, this journey I tread,you joined along to take this caravan ahead.]
-Where's this gate?-I don't know.
Let's ask him.
Excuse me?
We seem to have taken a wrong turn.
Where's the departure gate?
Why don't you guys bathe?
Sorry?I'm afraid I don't understand.
Cannabis has made you brain dead.
How will you understand?
Cannabis?He's selling us stuff.
Yes... cannabis.Always ready, aren't you?
Junkies.
If the whole world heads to Goain search of peace,
who'll do real work?
Chill.
Why is he getting agitated?
How will the world function?
I see a cop.Wait there.
I'll be back.
Did you see that?
He ran away.Chicken!
No.
We have nothingmatching that name.
No... no.
Look, they're my sister'spersonal effects.
Please check properly.
I just checked in front of you.
This consignment had only two bodies.
There was nothing else.
You guys are unbelievable.
First, you told me to goto Kochi to collect a parcel.
I went there... they said,"Pick the parcel from Bangalore."
Is this a joke?
Calm down, sir.
You're getting breathless.
Let's not burden the familywith two deaths.
What nonsense is this!
Bloody liars!
I'm going to report this.
Sir, I was just concerned.
I'm going to report this!
He doesn't understand.
I checked in front of you.
Sir, you mentioned thatyou've received only two bodies.
I have someone else's body...
that means the other personhas my father's body.
Where was that body dispatched?
Kochi.
Kochi?
Here's the number.
-Fine?-Thank you.
Why do you dress so scantily?
What will you dowith the remaining fabric?
Are you saving itfor poor kids in Africa?
Africa?No, Europe...
Shaukat, come on.
Just a minute.Let the lady respond.
I'm waiting.
Dad's body may be in Kochi.
Please excuse me...
There's a corpse at stake.
How did he reach Kochi?
There was a mix up.
Why don't you checkif he's even dead?
Are they playing a dirty joke?
The cops didn't understandwhat I was saying either.
Don't worry about it.
This guy is nice... Shaukat.
He told me the directions.
We have to go that way.
Shall we take a photo with him?
Come, come... photo.
Fantastic.
Perfect.
Thank you.
Live large!
Bye.
Hello?
Ms. Tahira Moidenkutty?
Speaking.
This is Avinash from Bangalore.
-I think my father's coffin is...-With me.
Thank God you called.
I didn't know what to do.
I have receiveda wrong coffin, too.
My mother's.
So, how do we do this?
I run a hotel in Fort Kochi.
Right now, I'm stuck here.
But...
Can your husbandor a relative come to Bangalore?
I wish.
But you see,I'm a single mother.
Besides my motherand daughter...
now... even mom's gone...
She's crying.
Say, "I love you."
She's vulnerable.She's yours.
Alright. I... please calm down.
I'll meet you half way.
Where should we meet?
Coimbatore?
Coimbatore?
Coimbatore isn't half way.She's playing you.
Never trust a crying womanor the milkman.
Okay.
I'll work out a planand get back to you.
Okay, thank you.
Take care.
So, Avinash...
What plans for the long weekend?
I'm going to Coimbatore.
Coimbatore?
Nice.
To pick up my father's dead body.
-Hi.-Hi.
Going somewhere?
I'm going to Coimbatoreto drop off a...
package.
For a client.
I see.
I've secured the corpse down tightly.
We can go as fast as we want.The coffin won't budge.
-It's not what it sounds like.-No...
Goodnight.
I can explain...
This building complex is nice.
Good you decided to move.
Ever since you moved out,we face so many problems...
Water shortage...
It's a long list!
Uncle... uncle.
Get away!
Mr. Rehmat, Shaukat has vamoosed.
I think he's leaving the city.
Tell me, what I should do?
I want to hold an exhibition.
Is this the age to experiment?
And with somethingyou aren't sure can pay the bills.
But I know that I can bea good photographer.
So, was software engineeringto while away time?
You were on the merit list.
Dad, I love photography.
Alright.Do as you please.
If you've decided anyway,why this discussion?
Go on, then!
Invite everyone.
Make a spectacle of yourself.
And of me too.
Hello?
Avinash...
Tahira, what happened?
My daughter... Tanya...
was going to reach here today.
But, she's missing.Her mobile's switched off, too.
Okay.
I even called the college.
But, everyone's awayfor the long weekend.
No one answersthe office phone at night.
I don't know what to do.
When did you speak to her last?
Last night.
I told her about mom.
She was very upset.
She was very close to mom.
And, now...
Oh God!
Tahira, crying will achieve nothing.
Tell me, where's her college?
What the...
Ooty. SFS College.
How about this...
-I'll go to Ooty.-What the...?
-It's on our way.-Ooty's not on our way.
I'll go to her college and find out.
It's the absolute opposite direction.
Don't flirt on a funeral trip.
-Could you do that?-Sure.
Don't cry.
I've reached Mysore already.
Ooty is three hours away.
It could take four hours, too.Depends on the driver.
I'll call you from there.
Thank you, Avinash.
I'll message you Tanya's details.
Take care, Tahira.
Take care?
Have you taken responsibilityof the entire world?
Are you the Mandela of South India?
We're already ferryingan unknown aunt's body in our van.
Now, you'll go to a collegeand pick up an unknown girl?
Dude, she was crying.What could I do?
Think about it, Shaukat.We'll earn blessings.
My van runs on diesel,not blessings.
She'll have to pay up.

As per records, Tanyahasn't left the campus.
Every student has to sign outwhen they leave.
By the way, Tanya didn't even mentionthat she wants to go home.
There she is.
-Tanya?-Tanya.
No. Not this one.
Tanya Moiden something.
-Moidenkutty.-Yes?
Sir.
Excuse me.
Your mom's waiting for you at home.
You were to leave yesterday?
What the hell are you saying?
Okay. Come with me.
Why should I go anywhere with you?
Who are you?
Listen, mister... I'm not gettinga good vibe from you.
I'm calling the security...
-Security!-Chill... chill.
You're very strange.
There's been a death at homeand you're behaving like this?
Excuse me?
Death?
Don't you know?
What?
Your... grandmothermet with an accident.
Your mom called you the day before?
You're Tahira's daughter, right?
Yes.
Oh, no.
How could I forget?
You forgot?
Mom did call.
-But I had had too much to drink.-You were drunk?
My phone died.
I kept it to charge...
But, who are you?
My dad was in the same accidentas your grandmother.
Oh. I'm sorry.
The travel agency sent the body.
But, not to me.
To your mom.
And I got your grandmother.
I'm going to meet your momfor an exchange.
-To Coimbatore.-You mean...
Grandma's bodyis here with you?
Yes.
The body's decomposing rapidly.
We might need some dry ice.
I'm sorry.I should've...
We'll buy it along the way.
Sounds good.
I'll get my bag.
This girl can't ride with us.
Why not?
Buddy, her legs are fully bare.
What?
I can't allow suchexposure in my van.
Please, don't do this.
No, bro.Rules are rules.
Tell her to cover up.
Talk to her, bro.It's very important.
This is my van.Not a strip club.
Tanya...
It might get cold en route.
So?
Why don't you...wear something longer?
I can't believe this.
Creep.
Don't misunderstand.
Tanya...
Let's go, driver.
Bloody hell...
Excuse me?
What the hell did you just say?
Miss, if you cuss again in English,
I'll stuff you in the boxwith your grandma.
Listen...
-I can't do this.-What happened?
Get rid of her.
Bro... Shaukat.
I'm not taking her along.Make her go.
You insisted we leave at night.I agreed, didn't I?
It's your turn now.
Let her ride in your van.
Please. For me.
-For you?-Yes.
For you, I'd even eat my vegetables.
Come.
Listen, miss.
I'm not a driver.I own this van.
You're a guest in here.
-That's why, I forgive you.-Whatever.
Come on.
Yes, Tahira.
Tanya's with me.Nothing to worry about.
Thank you so much, Avinash.But, where was she?
She was... very upset aboutlosing her grandmother.
She had locked herselfin her room.
Everyone has their wayof dealing with grief.
-Why don't you speak to her?-Avinash...
I was so stressed,I haven't left yet.
I can leave in an hour.
But you'll have to wait a little.
It will take me aroundfour hours to reach...
We'll come to you.Take care of the hotel.
Buddy, you take care of yourself.
Are you sure?
Yeah. No problem.
Are you kidding?It's such a long drive.
I can drive.
I'd rather die!
Why don't you speak to Tanya...
-Hi, mom.-Hi, Tanya.
Are you okay?
I'm okay.Are you okay?
What's gotten into you?
It's my van.Let me have a say.
The van might give up!
You wanted us to go on a drive...spend time together...
This drive's gotten slightly longer.
-That's good, isn't it?-Slightly?
It feels like I've been drivingsince my teens.
So, what's this Avinash fellow like?
He's okay.
He seems to be a sweet guy.
How will theyget down from there?
I'm speaking in Hindi, madam.
What's this box?
Latha Nambiar...
It's a Kottayam address.
Oh... this is here!
What is it?
That... Nambiar's sister.
Nambiar's sister?Fit in such a small box?
Is this guy for real?
Blabbering in English again?
What?
What do you mean?
The box still has space.Careful.
Let me measure...how tall are you?
Hello.
I don't want a new mobile plan.Hang up!
-He hung up.-Let me call him.
I don't wanta new mobile plan!
Hello... I've kidnapped your wife.
And she's bawling away.
Now, listen carefully.
Hello.
Sir, I had collected a coffinfrom you yesterday.
I found a box in it.
In the name of Latha Nambiar.
Did her brothercome back to collect it?
No...
What should I do with it?
Do what you think best, sir.
But, where's my wife?Please tell me.
Wife?
Throw it away.
It's an unidentified parcel.Could be a bomb... you'd know.
Is my wife alright?Is she eating?
She has a blood pressure issue.If she doesn't eat, she'll faint.
What a weirdo!
-He keeps talking about his wife.-Ignore them.
There's no more place in the van.
What do we do with this?
Let's open it.
If there's anything of value,we'll split it.
What?
No.
This doesn't belong to us.
We should return itto its addressee.
Shall we go to the post office?
Long weekend.
It won't open for another three days.
Anyway, this addressisn't far from Kochi.
On our way maybe...
What?Not again!
Enough of this South India tour.
Let's get about the jobat hand and leave.
Shaukat, she's right.
It has sentimental value.
She's right...but that doesn't mean I like it.
I've to claim a fortunefrom your mother for fuel.
I'm keeping an account.
He's got a good heart.

Thanks for handlingthat with mom.
You're dealing withthis very bravely.
I should be practical like you, right?
If you were close to your grandmother,the tears make sense.
My dad and I weren't... so...
I'm going to get somethingto drink. Need anything?
Just keep an eye.
Cash.
Cash.
Cash.
Gas...
Stop! Thief!
If you don't getyour hands dirty...
how can youtruly taste life?
Hello.
Nambiar?
Nambiar.
Is anyone home?
Nambiar.
Right.
Nambiar.
Can we speak to someone?
-Nambiar.-Allow me.
Sir, greetings.
Who came first?The chicken or the egg?
Nambiar.
-He doesn't understand Hindi.-Genius!
You're from Kerala.
Don't you know Malayalam?
We aren't originally from here.
You're useless.
You're from Bangalore.
Do you know Kannadiga?
Kannadigas are people of Karnataka.
The language is Kannada.I know that.
This argument is pointless.
I know a little Pashto.Should I give it a shot?
Sir...
Mom speaks Malayalam!
Hello.
(Speaks in Malayalam)
He's gone.
With the phone...
Don't be silly.
You came to deliver the box,now you've lost your phone.
Hello.
Okay.
What?
But...
Okay, fine.
Buddy, what just happened?
Tahira said that he needed it...to buy new shoes for his child.
-And you gave it?-Yes.
Did you getany information?
Yes.
There's a place ahead,Kumarakom.
They've gone for a ceremony.
-A party?-Yes.
Free food? Bring it on.
Let's go.
"He has a good heart."
Funny!
What grace!
It's a wedding ceremony.
What's this?
My wedding look.
-I'm not going in like this.-It's not your wedding.
Why would you godressed like this?
Thanks.
Shaukat.
Shaukat.
So beautiful!
Where are the bride and groom?
Wonderful.
How's it my fault?
Everything was readyfor the wedding
until your dad decidedthere won't be one.
Please try and understand, Rajat...
The bride and groom...
I think I've beendamn understanding.
-This is just impossible.-Forget it.
It's my fault, okay?
My aunt diedand screwed things up, right?
Did I say that?
Just... just give me a break.
My wedding just got canceled.
Mine, too.
And rescheduled...not canceled.
Look, I don't want to fight.
Do me a favor.
Tell your friends there'sgoing to be a prayer meet instead.
They need to cut the noiseand show some respect.
Lakshmi, please understand.
They've come from Europeto attend a wedding in Kerala.
To party in 'Incredible India'.
And I hate to say this,
but your aunt's deathmakes no difference to them.
And the bar's been open...half of them are sloshed.
How do I control them?
I understand, Rajat.
And honestly, it doesn't reallymatter to me either.
But we have to managethe situation for now, don't we?
-Please do something.-Alright. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'll talk to them.
Excuse me?
What is it?
Is Latha Nambiar a relative of yours?
Sir, we met at the Bangalore airport...
Hey.
Hi.
We've come to deliver yourfiance's aunt's personal effects.
Oh, really?
Thank God.
My father-in-law wasquite hyper about it.
I'm sure.
Oh, that's a relief.
If you're up for a drink,the bar's open.
-Okay.-Okay.
Go ahead...I'll join you.Be there in a minute.
Maestro...
Do you have to play all day?
All day long.
I remember my first timein India.
What a wonderful summer!
It was beautiful back then.
Not quite so anymore.
More?
You've taken away everything.
What more do you want?
Sorry?
What's the point of apologizing now?
You divided the country.
Took all our jewels.
You're still living off them.
What?
You duffers invented cricket,but we still beat you at it.
-Did he say duffer?-Did he say cricket?
Yeah...cricket.Let's play a game right now.
I have my bat.
We can play there.
Hit that wall for two runs.
That pipe for four.
Into the lake... and you're out.
I'll whack the ball so hardthat you'll forget how to bowl.
Get up.
You scared?
I respect the occasion,or you'd be buried right here.
What?
Sir, please...
No, buddy.
I feel sick thinking about it.
Do you get it?
Don't fight.
They're guests.
Oh God!
What in the name of God?
Oh God!
What are they doing?
Oh, she's drinking alcohol.
Good Lord!
Forgiveness, O Lord!
Shaukat.
Buddy, we should get out of here.
What?
This place is the secret lairof the devil.
What's the matter, Shaukat?
Avinash, you are too naive.
Look what's happening there.
Look.
What the...?
Exactly. What the...!
Let them be.
Maestro!
Seriously?
You're drinking?
Again?
Yeah.
Hi. I'm Avinash.
And we're going to meetyour mother.
Will you remember that?
Of course.
You want a drink?
I'm fine.
You don't drink?
Not too much.
Not before sunset.
Avinash...
It's cool to breakthe rules sometimes.
Come, have a shot with me?
Maybe you've forgotten thatwe're not here to party.
Our situation is a bitmore grave.
You said that you weren'tclose to your dad.
Why so serious suddenly?
True.What's your excuse?
Grandma would'veapproved of me drinking.
-Really?-Yes.
She hated tearsand all that shebang.
Shall we?Come on, Avinash.
Stop being a party-pooper.There's no office tomorrow!
Come on, buddy.It's my wedding day.
Yeah, but we don't know you.
Was my wedding day...
It's okay.
-Easy.-Bro.
Come on.Let's have some shots.
Shots for all of us.Bring it on.
-You guys drink.-No... no.
You have to.For me.
Come on... cheers... to weddings.
To weddings!
One more... one more.
Just two's fine.
To funerals.
To funerals.
God, I needed this.
It's doom's day!
The world has turned topsy-turvy.
That's my friend.
He'd set out for his father's funeral.Wine has now seduced him.
God save us.
Is there no other way to be happy?So much intoxication!
They are all slaves to revelry.
I'm tired of playingthe shehnai at weddings.
Sir, then come with me.
I won't let you sufferany longer.
Come.
-Now?-Let's go.
Look away.
What's up?
I have a headache.
Shaukat's sermon gotsomething to do with it?
No.
He's another extreme.
But, life isn't all fun and games...
We must be true to our responsibilities.
Are you calling me irresponsible?
Maybe.
-What the hell?-How can you argue?
You didn't even rememberyour grandmother's death.
You think I'm not affected by it?
No. Because you werejust drinking... again.
You've moved on swiftly.
Can you please juststop judging me?
Don't teach mehow to live, oldie.
This pointless rebellion.
What's your problem?
Why such angst?
No love from the family?
Let me guess...your dad left you.
Or... some stupid boyfriend...
My dad had cancer...when I was eight.
He died soon after.
But mom loves me like crazy.
I am who I ambecause of my choices.
How's your trip, Shaukat?
Mr. Rehmat's asking if youfeel like returning his money.
Yes, I have to return it.
Immediately, in fact.
When exactly?
You've missed the deadline.
And you left the city...for a picnic.
The person who was to give methe money went offline.
Now when he comes online...I don't have money here.
Bro, you're picnickingwithout any dough?
No picnic! We're out for a funeral.The van's the pallbearer.
How I wish for such a funeral.
Here's what we'll do...we'll take your van.
No!
Hey, stop!
Avinash, stop him.
Get out of the way.
Stop!
Maestro... greetings!
Oh God!
The Almighty has spared you.
To be honest...
the way you tumbled...
I thought we'd neverhear you play again.
Thank the Lord for this bonus life.
Congratulations.
Dear Lord!
What rubbish you speak!
(Speaks in Malayalam)
Hello.
Yes, Tahira.
Okay.
Thank God.
Take care.
She says that he's saying...
that the van was spotted20-30 miles from here.
We'll know by morning.
What do we do now?
There's a hotel nearby.
I'll find out the details.
You get Shaukat.
Careful, nurse.
Do you know what it meansto be a nurse?
You've downloadeda butcher’s app instead.
Delete it.
She can't understandwhat you're saying.
At least she gets the emotion.
Aziz Hussain?
Shaukat, let's go...we've to wait till morning.
We're staying the nightin a hotel nearby.
Hotel? No way.
I'm still sore.
I need to stay the night here.
Okay.
Nurse... please!
I can't sleep.
Can I chill here for a while?
You've got full network?
Yes, why?
The uploads are too slow.
What are you uploading?
Just some picturesI took on the drive.
Can I see?
Sure.
Nice.
But you could frame them better.
How?
Like here,what's your subject?
That girl.
But you have unnecessaryelements in your frame.
If you had zoomed injust a little bit...
focus is on the girl.
That's an easy fix.
-On Instagram?-Yes.
Right.
What's your issuewith Instagram now?
Such apps are killing photography.
Click, swipe in a filterand everyone's like...
"Wow!"
So, that's a good thing, isn't it?
Everyone can becomephotographers.
Everyone thinksthey can become photographers.
This isn't photography.
This is just... lazy.
In that case, Snapchatwill give you a heart attack.
That's even crazier!
You're very old school.
I'd learnt that photographyis all about capturing a moment.
Not about creating a momentout of anything.
Editing it later, putting a filter...
Sure, the picture looks good.
But, the science behindtaking the photograph,
the joy... that's lost.
A string of four-five sentences?
Who knew you could talk so much?
But, you said thatyou learnt all of this.
I was interning witha senior photographer for a while.
You wanted to bea photographer?
Yeah.
Didn't work out.
Why not?
Long story.
I have time.
What a couplet, sir.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Another one, please.
Absolutely.
If I may...
Real beauty seeks no compliments.
Real beauty seeks no approval.
One appreciative glance is aplenty.
Fantastic.
What a couplet!
But then why didn'tyou fight with him?
You could've put your foot down...
Things were different back then.
Being a rebel was notcool in my circles.
And to pursue real photography...it's not cheap.
A middle class man's bank balance.
And a middle class boy's ethics.
Together, they don't...
Wait.
-Don't move.-What is it?
Just... stay.
Is it a lizard?
Listen, I hate lizards.
Give me your phone.
Hold still.
The light is great.
Okay...Now take a drag.
Wow!
You're damn good.
That's capturing a moment.
Now, don't mess with iton Instagram.
I can't upload iton Instagram anyway.
Mom will know that I smoke.
Ah.
And please, don't mention itor offer me a cigarette in front of her.
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.
And yours, with me.
What secret?
That you sometimes smile.
And such a rare occasioncalls for a selfie.
Uh... I need to get a toothbrush.
What?
I forgot to pack a toothbrush.
There's a 24-hour chemist here.
Oh, nice.
I need some stuff, too.
Come.
Please go on.
Go on.
If I may...
These sensual eyes makea sweet promise...
Is this a couplet?
No, a song.
From a film.
-A very good song.-I don't watch films.
Please recite a couplet,if you can.
Here goes...
listen carefully.
Some emotions are so consuming.
Some emotions are so pristine.
That they can't be snaredin the web of words.
What sort of couplet is this?
All that the heart wants to saymay not form a couplet.
Some words justflow from the depths.
What's this?
Sorry?
What is this?
Pregnancy test.
Yes, I can see that.
But, why?
To test for pregnancy?
I do know, but...is this for you?
I'm an adult.
It's cool...
I'm not so sure it's "cool".
What are you... 18?
You know at what age the average girlloses her virginity?
-Just take a wild guess.-No, thanks.
There are no linesleft to be crossed anymore.
This is normal. And it's healthyto be open about it.
And who gave you this advice?
Believe it or not, my grandma.
She was way coolerthan you'll ever be.
Or just crazy like you.
-What's your problem?-Nothing.
The way you livewill only attract problems.
Oh, wow.You're saying this?
After all the choices you've made.
What do you mean?
I don't want to live my liferepressed, like you.
Repressed?
Just 'cause I'm not loose like you?
Loose?
If you'd be more open-minded,you'd be happy.
You wouldn't haveso many problems.
You're a typical Indian manin this respect.
If a girl tries to be friendly,doesn't mean she's easy.
You're awkward becauseof your raging hormones...
Excuse me.
The girl with me...have you seen her?
The girl who came with me,did you see her anywhere?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I really shouldn't have...
and I wasn't going to...
I rarely share personal stuffwith people.
And I did with you.
That's why I was awkward.
Not because of...
hormones.
I know.
I was angry and I snapped.
Sorry.
So we're cool?
Cool.
Avinash... Purohit?
Rajpurohit.Is this about Shaukat?
Shit.What did he do now?
Who's Shaukat?No, this is actually about you.
You graduated from BCET, right?
Yes... you, too?
But I don't remember...
No. I wanted to be a doctorso I went to medical college.
Of course.
I'm sorry...
You're actuallymy wife's batch mate.
In fact, her friend.
At least, I hope so.
You're in all her college pictures.
Your wife?
Rumana Salim.
Rumi!
Exactly!
You'll hung out together, right?
Yeah.
I've met the rest of them.
You don't come to the reunions...
He has a problem with crowds.
He can't handlemore than three-four people.
How's Rumi?
Come home and ask her yourself.
Home?
-No... our friend's here...-And he's absolutely fine.
Anyway, he won't get dischargedtill tomorrow morning, right?
But, we're expectinga call from the police.
Boon of a mobile!You can be reached anywhere.
Let's go.
Rumana makes memind-blowing breakfast.
And breakfast before sunriseis the best...
I'm ready.
I'm a little hungry, too.
The canteen here's a bit dodgy.
Yes, best avoided.
Cool.
Done then, let's go.
Come guys.
Rumana?
In the kitchen.
Please come out for a minute.
I've got a surprise for you.
Raghu, if you've gotsome sick puppy again...
Avi...
Rumi.
-Hi.-Hi.
Hi, I'm Tanya.
Hi... Rumana.
You guys... I mean...what are you doing here?
We can catch upover breakfast too.
I'm starving.
-I'm... getting it.-Yes, come.
By the way...tell me something.
You guys are...friends since college.
Yeah.
Actually, we weren't at first.
Avi seemed to be the serious,creative type.
He still gives that vibe.
A friend in our group said thatAvi is actually very cool.
So... we decided to give the poor soula chance to join us.
He turned out to be a lot of fun.
You'll weren't too many, right?
No... because he has a problemwith crowds.
Nice...
Come on, guys.
I'm going to take a quick nap.
I've to go back to the hospitalin an hour.
We should leave, too...
At least let the food settle.
And if you don't tryRumana's coffee,
then you’ll regret it forever.

Has she dozed off?
She talks so much.
Must have tired herself out.
Let's sit out.
It's a beautiful place.
We love it here.
Coffee okay?
It's great actually.
Raghu was right.
Rumi...
On graduation day...
the way I left...
We don't have to talk about it, Avi.
No... I want to.
I know I did you wrong.
It was such a long time ago.
Honestly, the joy of seeing you hereovershadows all sadness.
I'm so sorry.
Apology accepted.
Thank you.
And... how's life?
Work?
Your dad?
Dad's... no more.
I'm so sorry.
When... did it happen?
A few days ago.
In fact, we're going to Kochito collect his body.
Are you okay?
Dad and I hadn't spokenfor many years.
So, how does it matterif he's around or not?
Let go of this hate now.
It's not hate.
At least, not anymore.
That maybe a bitbecause of her.
She seems like a lovely girl.
Isn't she a bit young for you?
I mean... whatever makesthe two of you happy...
Rumi, she's not my girlfriend.
Dad's body wentto her mom by mistake.
And we were takingher grandmother's body.
And all this happened...
Huh?
It's quite messed up.
Let's not go there.
Fine... maybe not a girlfriend.But a companion?
Stop it, Rumi.
Seriously, how did she help?
It's strange.
I'm interacting witha young person after very long.
It's very tough.
And sometimes, when I talk to her,I react exactly like dad.
Angry, unreasonable,old-fashioned.
It's a never-ending cycle.
It's often said...
"By the time a son realizesthat his father was right...
he has a son who tells himthat he's wrong."
Must be from the police station.
Do you speak Malayalam?
A little.
Hello.
I will keep your daughtervery happy.
She'll live the good life.
I'll take her shopping.
Take her to the movies.
I'll even give you dowry.
Sure?
Greetings.
Greetings.
Sir...
May I have a word with you?
With me?
The doctor has saidto take these medicines.
Okay.
Shaukat, allow me to introduce you...
This is my wife... Tasneem Bano.
Wife?
Yes, my third wife.
Praise the Lord!
Yes... medicine?
You were saying something.
Where are you going?
Hello?
You're looking fresh.
Didn't know you werea morning person.
Shut up.
See you...
Has she dozed off again?
Take care of yourself.
You, too.
-So?-So...
You're bad with goodbyes, right?
Let me help you?
Bye, Avi.
Bye, Rumi.
Take care of yourself.
You, too.
Good morning.
A good morning indeed.
Why?
Well...
I was nervous to come out here.
Why?
I thought there wasa one percent chance I'd come out
and not find you.
That can happen only after I die.
You're a doctor's wife.
I won't let you die so easily.
Is he okay?
Yes.
Did they find the car?
So, now?
I think he's on a journeyof self discovery.
Wow.
He has a perfect name for you.
-Rumi.-Come on...
Give it.
-Let's go.-Where ?
We need to make a pit stop.
Just a second, Shaukat.
Let it be.
Tahira's waiting for us.
Half an hour morewon't kill anyone.
I mean, no one else will die.
We were to go to Kochi.
You said,"Let's go to Ooty, instead."
I detoured.
Madam said, "Go to Kottayam."
I detoured, again.
Now, if I say we have to makeone more stop,
we've just got to!
Hello, Mr. Rehmat.
It's me... Shaukat.
I didn't have the money,so your boys took my van.
The money's been arranged.
Where do I drop it?
And where will I find these boys?
Message me the address.
Yes, I'm coming.
Mr. Rehmat's dogs!
This world is an unjust place.
You push arounda helpless one like me.
Are you happy vandalizing my van?
Give me my bat.
Wag your tails before him.
Lick his shoes.
He'll reward you with scraps.
He's spewing linesfrom an action flick!
I'll take you to court!
You'll pay for this!
Start the car.
Why? Don't you wanna fight?
Not today.
Then why did you get us here,you fool?
Misguided anger.I was sore about my heartbreak.
What happened withthe shehnai player's daughter?
Who?
What did I miss?
I'll tell you on the drive.
Start the car...let's get out.
Shit.
Shaukat, apologize.
Sorry?
Listen to me.
Apologize.
Take one slap...
and we get out of here.
Do they look likea women's activist group?
They won't stop at one slap.
What other choice do we have?
You had to go act all macho!
Back up the car.
Brothers, fighting has neverachieved anything.
Start backing up...
For example,take the situation in Kashmir...
Shaukat, now tell me...
what are you involved in?
A long time ago my fatherborrowed a large sum
from the wrong kind of people.
-I'm paying that price.-What?
Father?
But, you said that you'd nevermet your father.
He was a drunk.
He used to beatmy mother and me.
If I'd resist, he'd shut me upsaying that it was his right.
People abuse their relationships...they don't care to nurture them.
My mother thought it her dutyto take the beating.
One day,I gave it back to my father.
Instead of thanking me,mother threw me out of the house.
She was used to the insults.
She couldn't live without them.
I never met the father hiddenbehind that drunk guy.
So, I tell peopleI've never met him.
My mother...
Sorry, Shaukat.
What a vile guy.
He's troubling meeven after his death.
The father departmentis tragic for all of us, isn't it?
And what's the angle withthe shehnai man's daughter?
Couldn't form an angle.
Could have...if she were his daughter.
Turned out to be his wife.
-The third one.-Wife?
The third.
If he wasn't so old,I'd chop him and donate his organs.
-Hi, mom.-Tanya!
-Hi.-Hi.
-We finally meet.-We finally meet, yes.
My friend, Shaukat.
Hello!
Absolute pleasure to see you, Shaukat.
Here's a lovely woman!
So sorry... I've troubled you a lot.
No. You haven't troubled us.
She has.
I'll tell you at length.
Sure.
Where's mom?
Ma's on Nano.
-Excuse me?-Nano, the car.
She didn't fit inside.
Need some help?
That's okay.
The right one's yours.
So far, I was withthe wrong one.
You must bein a hurry to return...
but, I've organizeda prayer meeting for mom.
It's an informal affair.
-If you...-We'll stay.
Nice.
If you don't mind, could you saya prayer for my dad, too?
Sure.
I don't know how this works.
Avinash!
Some of your dad's things.
Thank you.
Hello.
There's both,good and bad news.
Which one first?
Bad news.
I'm not pregnant.
And... the good news?
That I'm not pregnant.
The best news is thatyou've smartened up.
Some of my goodnesshas rubbed off on you.
Please! Not at all.
Of your countless sermons,
I've only learned thatthere's a difference...
between rebellionand recklessness.
That's very deep.
Very Sufi-type!
I think you mean Rumi-type.
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for coming.
It means a lot to me.
The shortest and most beautiful wordin this world is... mom.
Some are engineers... doctors,others poets... painters.
But, for her child, a motherhas to be all of these.
Then one day,the child grows up.
And becomes cleverand worldly wise.
Leaves the nestand takes flight.
This too, the mother accepts.
Then she spendsthe rest of her life worrying.
My mother was just like that.
Like every mother in the world...
just... perfect.
Hello, Brij. How are you?
Hope you're in the best of health.
Heard that your son Rahul,is running the company now.
Good to hear.
How's Avinash?
I haven't spoken to him in days.
To be honest... we don't talk.
He's upset with me.
He thinks that I've ruined his life.
He wanted to pursue photographyand I forbade him.
I too, wanted to learn the pianoand pursue a career in music.
But, I had seen so many hardships...that I gave up.
I thought I'd comeand meet him...
to tell him that he could worka few years and retire early.
Then he could pursue photography.
But, I'm unable to.
I'm scared of his hatred.
Till I muster up the courage,please take care of him.
He's all I have.
And I hope that whenthe time comes,
my daughter sayssuch words for me, too.
In the same accident,
a friend also lost his father.
We'll say a prayer for both...
The second most complicatedand beautiful word is... dad.
I spent yearstrying to figure him out.
And he spent years judging me.
But, neither of usunderstood each other.
We had a strange relationship.
We never expressed our love.
But time is the greatest teacher.
And now, when I do understand...
we've run out of time.
Fact is...
I don't know if my fatherwas a good man.
But I know now that he wasn't bad.
And these days,even "not bad" is pretty great.
For you.
What's this?
It's called a camera.
It's used to click photos.
Click good onesand email them to me.
I'll teach youhow to color correct them.
Oh?
Thank you.
Where's Shaukat?
Someone called me?
Yes.
Did you ask for me?
-This is for you.-Why? What's this?
You'll need musicfor your return journey.
And with these, this grumpy guywon't get disturbed.
-Thank you.-You're welcome.
Girl, you're quite alright!
Thanks, buddy.
If you ever need anything,give me a shout.
I'm very resourceful.
I'll get your work done in a jiffy.
Why are you traveling at night?
Leave in the morning.
We're already quite late...
Please.We'll have dinner together.
It'll be nice.
I make excellent lamb.
On!

You should... come with me.
Come...
Avinash... Tasneem.
Hello.
The Maestro's missus...has come to file a complaint.
A complaint?
The old man isn'tas noble as he appears.
She says that he hits her.
So?
So... she's coming with us.
Wait...
What?
She's eloping with me.
Shaukat, we won't do anything illegal.
We roamed all of South Indiawith a dead body.
And it's illegal to helpa girl in trouble?
Shaukat...
The most celebrated love storieshave met with resistance.
But everyone doesn't need to diein the name of love.
A soulless body is betterthan an empty heart.
I don't know what that means.
That means... start the car.
Stop!
Don't go, sweetheart.
Stop!
Avinash, stop.
Stop... for a minute.
Aren't you happy?
You don't understandmy situation.
You don't understandmy passion.
-Look...-I'm looking...
I'm scared.
This is a sin.
To bear torture is a greater sinthan to commit it.
Shaukat...
This world is ruthless.What will people say?
People are ruthless.The world bears the brunt!
Don't repeat my mom's mistakes.
What?
I'll explain later.
Right now, say the wordsand free yourself.
Please listen to me.
Tell me.
I want a divorce.
Step on it!
Wait... stop!

Goodnight.
I couldn't care less aboutyour goddamn reasons, Avinash.
I clearly said that I wantedall the reports on Monday morning.
With a cover sheet.
Yes!
Because that's protocol.
So where the hell are they?
I've given you a lot of chancesbecause of dad.
But, this is just impossible.
Decide if you wantto keep this job.
I don't...
-I'm sorry?-I don't want this job.
I quit.
Don't walk away!
Come back here... Avinash!
Also you're a terrible boss, Rahul.
You should take a pagefrom your father's book.
Hey! Don't you dare tell mehow to run my own company.
And the network speedthat you keep complaining about...
is because you surf porn sitesduring office hours.
Dude, you're the headof an IT company.
You should knowthose sites are full of malware.
How dare you?You know what... you're fired.
Yeah... you understand that?You're fired!
Just a second, Rahul.Hold that.
It's a lovely frame.
Check it on my Instagram feed.
Are you out of your mind?
Listen, you son of a...
you can beg, fall at my feet,you're not getting this job back.
Yeah...
I'll make sure this is the endof your IT career!
What? Back to your seats!
Bro.
How?
Wow... how did you...?
It's very easy.
You should try it.
What are you looking at?
