Morning
Good morning
Another all-nighter?
You're part-time, right?
Do full-timers work Saturdays, too?
Listen,
Sakutaro is an odd name, no?
Dad was a fan of the poet,
Hagiwara Sakutaro
He wrote Chiekosho?
No, not that
What, then?
What was it. . .
You don t even know
Wow, some ugly weather
The typhoon's getting close
Typhoon #29 is currently
at sea, southwest of Kagoshima,
moving north slowly, at about
20 kilometers per hour
We aren't seeing any rain yet,
but thick storm clouds are moving in
from the west,
promising a torrent to come. . .
Don't you have a girlfriend?
l do
So, go home, then
What?
The move
l said, l m fine
You're the one l'm worried about
lt s loneIy living alone in the city
Listen, Dad, don t you have
anyone special?
Haven t you been lonely since l left?
l'm not making fun of you,
l'm worried
lt s not like I m leaving the country
I ll come back and visit

Excuse me, do you have
any Walkmen?
lf you wanted MD players,
they're really compact now
These here aII take CDs. . .
Excuse me,
do you have a Walkman
for playing cassette tapes?
Cassettes?
October 28th. . .
l don't know why. . .
l can't get to sleep
I'm so afraid of tomorrow
that I can't fall asIeep
l think. . .
l'm going to die soon
CRYlNG OUT LOVE,
lN THE CENTER OF THE WORLD
l'm going away for a while
Don't worry about me - Ritsuko
. . . the super typhoon, #29,
which struck Kagoshima,
has maintained
its ferocious strength,
traveling north at approximately
15 kilometers per hour
The atmospheric pressure at
the center is 950hPa,
the maximum wind speed
near the center is 40 meters,
and within the parameters
110 kilometers southeast and. . .
Welcome
Oh, it's you
HeIluva welcome
l'm starving, Ryu
Eat at home
You' ve got a cute fiancee
Whatever
Shit
I never should ve introduced you
to Ritsuko
You re marrying her
Better treat her right
What?
Ritsuko's gone
Gone?
She left a note,
'' l'm going away for a whiIe''
A note? That's bad, man
You write a note if you re
going to elope, man,
or for a double suicide
Double suicide? Suicide?
No way
You caIl her?
No
CalI her
Hurry up and call,
her life's at stake
Oh, all right
Hurry
. . . this afternoon, many Kyushu-bound
flights have been canceled,
stranding more than
50, 000 passengers
If Typhoon #29 continues
its northerly course,
it should hit Shikoku
tomorrow afternoon. . .
Hey, Saku
That s. . .
Ritsuko, isn't it?
Why d you hang up?
But. ..
. . . we can anticipate many
more canceled flights,
and disruption of travel plans
That's all. . .

Saku! Over here
You're Iate
Sorry
Next, a euIogy from a Kobane High
School student, who she taught
Hirose Aki, 11th grade
Yes
To Principal Kunimura,
l offer my heartfeIt condolences
on your passing,
and would like to take this opportunity
to thank you for teaching me
Teacher,
I wish l had no need to
say these things
l really feel great sorrow,
at the sudden news of your death,
and l can hardly beIieve
that l have to stand here
and speak these words,
to a photograph
l think of what you always said,
'' Beginnings are just
continuations of other things,'
about the real meaning
of those words
Our memories of you. . .
Hirose s amazing
The other girls were just crying
their eyes out
She s like totally mature
or something
Sakutaro!
Uncle Shige,
you knew our principal?
She was my first love
l wanted a memorial photograph
of her,
but l couldn't even see her face
No way, this was our principaI?
The war was over
and we'd survived
But I was starting over from scratch,
lost my whole family,
totally broke
So,
l worked Iike a dog to win her
l did everything but commit murder
Like what?
l can t tell you
So l got things together
But then. ..
But then what?
But then, she d already married
a man her parents had chosen
But that's. . .
Back then,
that's how it was done
Hey, Saku,
there aren't any cute girls
I like,
like a girl who reads
books on the train
Who s Iike. . .
What are you staring at, you lech
What's that?
Hey, hey, Iisten, listen!
lt's Tachi, the movie star!
- Tachi?
- Tachi Hiroshi
lt's a movie shoot,
he's playing some cop
Where? Where?
Over there?
Can you call that girl over?
Hirose!
Come here!
Yes
lt's just a pick-up shot
May we take your picture?
Do you mind?
l'll take your photo
Hey, Tachi s gone
Hey, isn't that Aki?
Hey, that's Aki
It's Aki, Aki! Why? Why?
What? Her debut?
Debut?
Very nice
Ouch
l caught a fooI
Ouch, ouch, ouch. . .
l caught a fooI
l knew you came to schooI
on your motorbike
l' ve seen you riding it before
Are you going to rat on me?
Hey, what s this?
Here
What?
Hurry
Hurry up
Oh, well
Don t hold on so tight
Feel my breasts?
Listen, Saku
Please don't
Don t what?
CaII me Saku
Everybody calIs you that
Just the guys
Well, Nakagawa's a girl
She's not reaIly like that,
so it's okay for her, too
Why not me, too, then?
When you do it, l feeI
like you're teasing me
l'm not teasing
You're different from
the other girIs, Hirose
I m different?
You re smart and
you're a great athlete,
and you're popuIar. . .
You re going into
show business, right?
You're like,
a little classier. . .
lt s like you're here
- What?
- Going home
Aren t you riding with me?
We live in opposite directions
Then why d you ask for that ride?
That's a no-brainer
How else could l talk to you?
A score of 82, what a laugh
If l get serious,
l can do a lot better. . .
Wait a second
What?
32,000 Yen, huh
Expensive
You win the same thing,
if they read your postcard
on Midnight Wave
Midnight Wave?
A Iate night radio show
Hey, I'lI race you!
What?
Let s both send postcards and
see who gets the Walkman first
l'm home
Welcome home, Sakutaro
You're late, was it a girl,
Sakutaro?
Shut up, ugly
Shut up!
Whether you're cramming,
working or broken-hearted. . .
This is it
We're coming to you from FMKB
So, another round of Midnight Wave,
all night Iong
Our first request comes from a listener
by the pen name, Banana Boat
''OMEDAY'' by ano Motoharu
' The passage year. . . '
' The passing year
' The passing year is yet
another traveling''
So even amnesiacs can laugh
at memories
Hey, Saku!
Hirose san
Hirose san
We' ve taIIied up votes and
Hirose Aki has been eIected
to play Juliet
l wonder how Juliet feIt
when she woke up
How it feels to have
your Iover die first
Ask Uncle Shige
Why?
Between you and me,
Uncle Shige, who runs the photo studio,
his first love was our principal
No way
They were planning to marry,
but war came and
prevented their union
But it was all in his mind, realIy
And he still loves her
Fifty years is half a century
l can't imagine dreaming of
the same person for half a century
lt s loveIy
l'd like to hear
Uncle Shige's story
Are you nervous?
With that face, you ll
never get in anywhere
Brighten up
What kind of face shouId I make?
l don't know how to smile
OK, don t laugh
All right
Done
Thank you
Thanks again
I don't mind teIling you. . .
But not for free
l still say this is nuts
You think?
We could get arrested
For what?
I think it's romantic and lovely
You think?
lt'll be so much nicer
with UncIe Shige,
than stuck in this desolate place
lsn't that it?
What s he going to do
with her bones?
Carry them to his grave
Oh, right
UncIe Shige can t share
her grave
Light up the inside
Oh, sorry
ln a way, this is like
finding eternaI love
But it s all over if you die
Shall we ask?
What?
When you die,
does love die, too?
- Does Iove die, too?
- Does Iove die, too?
Over here, here!
Someone's coming
Watch your step,
watch your step
Listen,
l'm covered with bites
Sit down
This is the most beautifuI place
I know, so it's alI for you
lt's a grave
That's Johnny and Nakagawa
No way
So many mosquitoes
They're dating?
Who s there!
Run! Run!
Who s there!
Saku?
Saku! Hey
Hey, Saku, man
lt's me, me
Johnny?
lt s been so Iong, man
How you been, man?
So, you wound up
taking over the tempIe?
Yeah, well
And what the hell
are you doing here?
Oh, nothing
Not nothing. . .
ls that Hirose?
Yeah, well
Right
Hirose, huh
She was amazing, Hirose was
A great athlete,
super smart, good at anything
To someone like me,
riddled with inferiority,
Hirose Family Grave
she was Iike a stab to the heart
She was so cooI
About twice a day,
no more than an hour
No more than an hour
Oh, really?
Hey
Sakutaro!
What, Sakutaro?
Sakutaro?
What are you doing back home?
What about your job?
WelI. . .
You must be busy with
the wedding coming up
Oh, this is perfect
l want you to see
the kimono l'll be wearing
l can't outshine what
Ritsuko's wearing, right?
l'll lay it out downstairs,
so take a look, OK?
Found it
This is Midnight Wave,
coming at you aIl night long
So, let's move on
to our next postcard
Pen name, Fried NoodIe Bread. . .
What!
l'm writing today about a tragedy
that befelI my classmate,
a quiet girl, with long hair
Our class decided to stage Romeo
and Juliet for the cultural festival
She was going to play Juliet
But she never made it onstage
She had leukemia
AlI her long hair fell out,
and she grew
unrecognizably gaunt
l won, right?
Hey? Were you asleep?
l know, you're jealous
Hey
Yes
The principal's bones. . .
Hey, Aki!
This is Aki
lf l see you in person,
l'm afraid l'Il either
snub you or slap you,
so l declded to
record this for you
Please listen to this on the Walkman
you won with your terrible lie
Listen, Saku. . .
The reason l was so furious
with you today,
was that l couldn't forgive
the heartless lie you toId
l don't think you should
tell lies like that
Have you considered
how sick peopIe feel?
What wilI you do if l die?
UncIe hige's love
lasted this long,
because it was never fulfilled
When you're together,
you see the other's fauIts
That may even push you apart
But l like to believe
it only deepens love
Um, l'm sorry
I regret what l did
You ve got piece of rice
stuck, there
Oh! Disgusting!
It's your turn next
What?
Record whatever you
have to say on tape
Then I'lI answer you again
lt's 8 o clock at night
l just had dinner
We had croquettes
l Iike soy sauce with my croquettes
Do you prefer soy sauce or regular
sauce with your croquettes?
What a ridiculous question
Aki. . .
l really don't know what to say,
so l'll just tell you how l feel
Being with you is fun,
and time passes so quickly
when we're together
l know it's a Iittle late, but. . .
Will you go out with me?
Don't Iaugh
Sure
July 14th
And that's how, l, Hirose Aki,
and Matsumoto Sakutaro,
started going out together, but. . .

No good, it's broken
There's film in there, but.. .

There are just tons of places
we ve never been
Ever since l was born,
l haven't been anywhere
No, reaIly?
Don t make fun of me
I m sorry, sorry

This may be

Kissing is what you do,
when you taIk about your dreams
Dreams?

we might find amazing pictures
lt suddenIy struck me, summer's
almost over
Yeah
Who named you Aki,
after the falI?
My father
Fall. ..
Reading in faII,
sports in fall,
faIl appetites. . .
Saku
You think they named me
after a season?
They didn't?
They called me Aki after,
Hakuaki
Hakuaki?
Aki
lt's the geoIogic era,
when the most new plants and
animals emerged and flourished
They named me Aki,
hoping l would fIourish, too,
the way dinosaurs and ferns did
Like a dinosaur?
That's right
Say, Saku
Why did they name you Sakutaro?
Because my Dad's a big
Hagiwara Sakutaro fan
Hagiwara Sakutaro. . .
He wrote Chiekosho?
No, not that
What, then?
What was it?
You don t even know
l'm wide awake, now
You re late!
Did you do it?
l couldn't
What a fucking moron
After all the trouble l went to
Saku! Oki!
Aki!
Sakutaro / Aki
Hey, Saku!
Saku!
