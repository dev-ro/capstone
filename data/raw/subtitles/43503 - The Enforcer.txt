All clear, Governor?
OK, Rico.
Come on out.
Let's go.
Check it.
There's nobody out there.
How do you know?
Flank him on the left.
If you get it, I'll get it.
Come on.
Yeah?
- They're here, Mr. Ferguson.
- OK. Be with them in a minute.
How's our witness?
He's falling apart.
I hope he holds
together until morning.
I'll put him on the stand
the first thing.
Send him in.
All right, Rico.
Listen, Ferguson,
I've made up my mind.
I... I ain't gonna testify.
You got to get yourself a new boy.
Sit down.
Stop telling me to sit down.
"Take it easy, Rico."
"Relax, Rico."
Well, it's my neck.
He tried once in the farm,
once in the jail,
and once in the hotel.
He's going to get me.
Nobody's going to get you.
That's why
we brought you here.
Sleep tonight over
there on that cot.
Tomorrow morning,
we'll take you down
in the elevator
to the courtroom.
You don't even
leave the building.
You get on the stand and
tell us what you saw.
That's all you have to do.
Mendoza'll be there, won't he?
Uh-huh. Well...
he won't let me talk.
He'll find a way to kill me,
even if it's on
the witness stand.
It's a courtroom, Rico,
filled with police.
All I want you to do
is identify him.
I won't do it.
You go on the witness stand
tomorrow morning, 10:00.
I won't talk!
All right, if you won't talk,
I'll send you to the chair.
But you don't
want me in the chair!
You want Mendoza!
Please, Mr. Ferguson,
don't make me take the stand.
Well, what I've got on you, Rico,
I could burn you a dozen times.
But I'm... I'm letting
you squirm out,
because you're right.
I want Mendoza more
than I want you,
and you're going
to help me get him.
Do you think Mendoza
would let me fry him?
You don't know him!
He'll kill me tonight
with all your uniforms around.
He's locked up in
a cell, 9 stories below.
He's got organization.
That's busted.
How do you know?
Maybe he stuck a guy
in a cop's uniform!
Nah...
well, there's something
on it's way to kill me.
I can feel it coming.
Maybe from... there.
Or there...
there, or there.
I got a feeling
it's on its way.
He got away!
See, there's another.
I can hear, I can hear.
He's busted out!
See? The call to tell you.
Yes?
Oh, anytime tonight will do.
Oh, say, quillen,
what's that siren?
Uh-huh.
It's the Mayor.
He's late for an appointment.
You're lying. It's Mendoza.
He's busting loose.
I tell you he's
locked up in his cell!
He got out! He's coming
to kill me! He got out!
You want to see him?
All right, I'll show him to you.
Bring him along.
Here. See for yourself.
He's in there, huh?
You wanted to look, look.
I don't want to see him.
Here, take a look.
He's smiling at me.
Mendoza. Call him off.
I'm not going to the court.
I swear I won't!
Tell him I'm not squealing.
Rico!
You're going to talk,
do you hear me?
You're going to talk!
You're not blowing up this case!
It took 4 years
to put him in that cell,
and when he walks out,
he's going to the chair.
So, you're going to talk.
It's the only chance
you've got to live.
I'm afraid.
He'll never die!
He'll die. He's got to die,
and you're going to kill him!
I can't! Nobody can.
He ain't human.
Tomorrow morning at 10:00,
you go on the stand.
Take him back upstairs.
Now what's eating you?
I don't know.
Take a look around outside.
Like a cemetery.
Sorry, captain.
There's the window...
the one that's lit up.
Give me a cigarette.
And a light.
Now!
Rico!
I ain't going
to be shot to pieces
like no pigeon.
I'm getting out of here!
How bad is it?
I'm all right, sir.
It's only a flesh wound.
- Whitlow...
- Yes, sir?
Where did those shots come from?
I think they came from the roof
of the hotel across the street.
Uh, take him to the hospital.
Get me central control.
- Hey, doc...
- Yes?
Put this guy to sleep, will you?
OK.
Put him on the cot in my office.
Nelson speaking.
Block the exits to that hotel
across the street.
Search every room. Send a squad
up to check the rooftops.
300 rooms in that hotel.
We haven't got a chance.
Oh, Whitlow...
Yo.
Stay with him.
Don't leave him for anything.
How is he?
Everything ok?
Yeah.
Got some more coffee?
You got a big day ahead of you.
You better go home
and get some sleep.
Sleep?
Whoever was on that roof
is still loose.
They won't try anything else.
They shot their bolt.
Got Mendoza locked in a cell,
an air-tight indictment
for murder,
and an eye-witness to the crime.
It's what the law books
call an open and shut case.
Nothing can happen.
Yet...
here, drink your coffee.
We want you in that
court room tomorrow, too.
Where are you going?
I don't feel good.
OK. In here.
I'm right with you.
OK, Rico, that's enough air.
What, again?
Nelson!
He's out on the ledge below us,
trying to make the fire escape.
You can't make it, Rico.
You can't make it!
It's too far!
You're right. I can't do it.
I'm getting dizzy.
I'm coming back.
Take it easy, now, Rico.
Now, don't look down.
Keep your face to the wall.
Here.
Reach my hand.
Come on.
Take it easy, now.
A little more, now.
Wait a minute.
Get a good grip, there.
Can we take him?
Yeah.
It's crazy.
We had it all sewed up.
It's crazy.
Heh.
We could protect him against
everything but himself.
Send the boys back
to their precincts.
Nelson.
Well, can you go
to trial tomorrow?
No, sir.
My case is right there.
You shouldn't have gone to
trial with just one witness.
You should have waited.
Waited for what?
Every day Mendoza is free,
people are getting murdered.
The city spent hundreds
of thousands of dollars,
tied up the whole police force.
Months.
I pledged my word to the people
that Mendoza was
as good as convicted.
Now what do I say?
Mr. Mayor, if you want
my resignation,
you can have it. That'll give
you something to say.
Wasn't his fault.
Shut up, Whitlow.
If you want a goat, I am it.
I don't want a goat.
I want a conviction.
What do we do about Mendoza?
Are there any other witnesses?
If there were, don't you
think I'd have them?
It doesn't make any sense.
A man commits murders,
and there is nobody around
to testify against him.
I had somebody.
All right, what's
our legal position?
Mendoza's lawyers
will go to court
tomorrow morning,
ask for dismissal,
and get it. Like that.
There's nothing
we can hold him on?
I couldn't even
give him 30 days.
In 7 more hours,
Mendoza walks out of that court
room a free man.
How can that be?
What's wrong with the law
that we can't touch him?
Oh... I know.
Our kind of laws are designed
to protect the innocent.
It's not enough that
we know a man is guilty.
We have to prove it.
Ever have a tune
run through your head
and you can't
remember the words?
What are you getting at?
How many people did we
speak to on this case?
Oh... I'd hate to remember.
How many pages of testimony
do you suppose we took?
Enough to fill
a nice-sized room.
Heh.
Somewheres in that testimony,
somebody said something
that stuck in my brain.
It got lost in the shuffle
because we didn't need it.
We had Rico.
But now...
if I could only remember...
what was it?
Well, we got nothing else
to do tonight.
Let's try and dig it out.
Well, we can start from
right to left or left to right.
No, let's take it just
the way it came to us,
right from that
first crazy day.
Yes?
They made me kill my girl.
What's that, fella?
They made me kill my girl.
What girl?
What's your name?
Are you drunk?
I killed my girl.
What's her name?
Nina.
Nina what?
Nina Lombardo.
They made me do it.
They made me.
All right, they made you.
Now, where is the body?
They buried her.
I saw them.
Homicide.
Down here a little further.
Back over behind those trees.
All down through here.
Go past the grove.
Why did you pick
this place to stop?
I don't know.
- Was it here?
- I don't know.
Now, think.
Are you sure
it was around here?
They took her out of the
car after I killed her.
They had a shovel.
They dug a grave,
and they put her in it.
Where is the grave?
I don't know.
That's when I ran away.
I knew I was next.
Where's the car?
They must have junked it.
Way I figure is,
something's missing.
Maybe you're right, maybe not.
What were you doing way out here?
They brought us in a car.
What kind of a car?
A station wagon.
We parked.
That's when she knew
I was gonna kill her.
I told her it wouldn't hurt.
It didn't.
She didn't even know
when it happened.
I was kissing her.
You say you loved her.
In the same breath,
you say you killed her.
I don't get it.
I had to.
She was a hit.
A hit?
What's a hit?
I had the contract.
Oh, this guy is a
straightjacket case.
What do you mean?
What kind of a contract?
A contract.
I wanted to break it,
but they made me do it.
Who made you?
Who are they?
Big Babe, Philadelphia,
and Smiley.
Smiley ordered me.
He runs the troop.
What kind of a troop?
What are you, a boy scout?
Philadelphia and Babe
were there...
but it was Smiley
who made me do it.
I killed her.
I killed my own girl!
Hey, sergeant!
I think they found something!
They stole her!
They got her!
They took her away!
Book him.
For what?
Murder.
We can't book him on
murder without a body.
I'll give you odds we find it.
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.
Start checking the moniker file
on some guys named Philadelphia,
Big Babe, and Smiley.
Take him on to the station.
I'll meet you there at 8:00.
Sergeant, let's go.
Come on.
I loved her.
Come on.
I loved her, and I killed her.
I want to die.
Evening, captain.
Where's Duke Malloy?
Three.
Open up, quick!
When we got there
and cut him down,
he was dead.
Tell me again, what
was it he said about...
contracts?
Was that the word he used?
Yeah, he said it was a contract,
and that she was a hit.
You got any idea what he meant?
I never heard it in connection
with a killing before.
Have you?
No, sir.
Heh. Have you got
anything on this guy?
Who was he?
There's his sheet.
Mmm... that's nice.
James Duke Malloy.
14 arrests.
Everything from robbery
to assault and battery.
You got anything on those
names he mentioned?
Big Babe, Philadelphia,
and Smiley?
Well, I'm waiting for a report
from the alias file now.
Small-time hoodlum walks
into a police station
and gives himself up
for murdering his girl,
then hangs himself.
Did you believe
his story?
No, sir, I didn't.
Yes.
Heh.
Well, I can't blame you.
He talks about
contracts and hits
and being forced
to kill her, and...
and there's no body.
- Oh, Joe?
- Yes, sir?
Missing persons come up with
anything on Nina Lombardo?
No, sir.
No one by that name
is listed as missing.
She got a criminal record?
No, nothing on that.
Hmm. OK.
Well, Nelson, what
do you think it is?
Insanity?
Jealousy?
Revenge?
I don't know, but I'd say
it's none of those.
I believe Malloy.
Somebody made him do it.
Why, I don't know,
and who, I don't know.
There's one thing I do know.
He didn't have
an ordinary motive.
'Cause if he had had one,
we would have found a body.
What about that station
wagon he killed her in?
It's my job to start
looking for it...
as soon as I get out of here.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Excuse me, sir.
Captain, the railroad squad
picked up a fellow
by the name of
Tom Zaca this morning.
- Well?
- Well...
he was busting
all the windows of the train
as it was pulling
out of the station.
So?
Well, we checked him
against the alias file.
He is known as
Philadelphia Tom Zaca.
What jail you got him in?
No jail, sir.
They shipped him back
to the insane asylum.
He's only been released
from there 2 weeks.
Zaca...
there's someone here to see you.
Hello, Zaca.
I'd like you to try
to answer one question.
Why did Duke Malloy
kill his girl?
Ah, this is hopeless.
The other times he was here,
did he have any visitors?
None listed.
No contact at all
with the outside?
Here's a notation from
the mailing department.
He used to receive a
weekly carton of cigarettes
from Olga Kirshen's lunch stand.
Have you got an address on that?
Olga Kirshen?
Who are you?
We'd like to ask
you a few questions.
Do you know a
Philadelphia Tom Zaca?
Is he out?
Was out, he's back in again.
You had me scared.
If he scares you, why do
you send him cigarettes?
I only send him cigarettes
so if he gets out,
he won't come here
and make trouble.
How long have you known him?
Oh, from when he was a kid.
Um, would you like
a glass of water?
No.
From when he first moved here
from Philadelphia.
He used to come in and take
cigarettes without paying.
Once I tried to stop him.
Broke my arm.
He's strong like a bull.
You know anybody
named Duke Malloy?
Duke?
I don't remember no Duke.
How about a Big Babe
or a Smiley?
Big Babe...
Heh. On this block,
there's lots of Big Babes.
I know a Smiley.
Smiley Schultz.
Oh? Where does he live?
Let me think...
I once delivered him some
sandwiches when he had the flu.
Oh, it's around the corner.
The third or fourth house.
The one that has the Tailor Shop
on the first floor.
Thanks.
Um, about Philadelphia.
If you find out when
they're gonna let him out,
I'd appreciate it
if you'd let me know.
Sure.
Hello, Nelson.
What are you doing here?
We have to see
someone in the house.
What's burning?
Nothing important.
Someone clogged the furnace,
and it's smoking up the place.
We'll be out of here
in a few minutes.
Hey, chief! We found a body
burned in the furnace.
I'll give you a 6-2 and even
the body's name is Smiley Schultz.
Hey, Tailor...
you know a friend
of Smiley Schultz's,
a fellow they call Big Babe?
Don't bother me.
Who knows Big Babe?
I know him, mister.
He lives around the corner.
I just saw him.
Where?
He jumped into his car
and yelled at his wife
he was on his way
to st. Anne's Church.
Thanks.
This is Martin Ferguson.
Dispatch a car to
st. Anne's Church.
Pick up Babe Lazich,
wanted for murder.
Hold.
What would he be doing in church?
Robbing the poor box
or copping a plea.
Always worries me
when these hoodlums get religion.
Don't take me out here!
Let me stay inside!
They won't do nothing
to me in a church!
Leave me alone, put me down!
They'll burn me, too!
All right, let 'em through, there.
Let 'em in there.
All right, go on home.
Ahem.
Yeah, what do you want?
Is that fat hooligan
called Big Babe?
Yes, sir, Big Babe Lazich.
He lives in the neighborhood.
Have the squad take him
down to headquarters.
Ferguson's office.
Yes, sir.
That's all.
What do you make of this?
The lunatic's the only one
who makes sense.
He said something went wrong.
It certainly did.
What are you, an ice man?
Answer him.
What do you carry this around for?
I just carry it.
You just carry it.
Who burned your friend Smiley?
I don't know any Smiley.
You're lying.
You know him,
and you know he's dead.
I don't, I don't.
Then why did you say you
didn't want to burn too?
You know, they burned him.
I don't know.
Get the box.
You see this?
This was Smiley's.
He carried an ice pick, too.
Do all your friends
carry ice picks?
Take it away.
I don't want to see it.
Who is Duke Malloy?
I don't know him.
He said he knew you.
He said you made him
kill his girl.
I don't know what
you're talking about.
You know what a contract is?
Do you know what a hit means?
No, no.
You ought to know.
Duke said you belonged
to the same troop.
What is a troop?
What kind of a troop?
I can't talk.
I can't tell you.
I'm afraid.
Who are you afraid of?
I can't talk.
I can't.
Yes?
They're here, Mr. Ferguson.
I'm sorry to have to bring you
here at this hour, Mrs. Lazich.
What do you want with me?
This isn't good for the baby,
waking him up so late.
What's your name, son?
Louis.
Oh, Frank. Give Louis
a drink of water.
Your husband is in trouble,
Mrs. Lazich.
Oh...
how much trouble
has Babe got into?
How long have
you been married?
5 years.
You got any money?
Whatever he brings home,
we live on.
Tell me, what did Babe do?
What's the matter?
Mrs. Lazich, your husband is...
facing one to 20 years in jail.
How long he goes in for
depends on you.
Me? What can I do?
I'm going to bring him in here.
I want you to talk to him.
If he tells me
what I want to know,
if he tells me the truth,
I give you my word
I'll go easy on him.
Babe!
Babe, what did you do
to get in this mess?
I didn't do nothing.
What did you bring
her here for?
Why are you getting her
mixed up in this?
Babe, what did you do?
Tell him, he'll help us.
I can't talk. What do
you want me to do?
I can't talk!
Tell him what he wants to know.
What do we do if
they put you away?
Am I better to you
in jail than dead?
I can't tell him!
Oh!
What are you bawling for?
You're always crying!
Oh, Louis!
Let them go.
They had nothing to do with this.
You ain't got anything on me.
Louis...
Hey!
That car you smashed up
was a stolen car.
All right, I stole a car.
You got nothing more to say?
No, nothing.
Lock her up.
$5,000 bail.
Her? What are you
locking her up for?
She didn't do nothing.
She's a material witness.
Witness to what?
She heard you confess
to stealing a car.
Don't take me away.
What about the baby?
We'll take care of him.
This man will take your boy
to an institution
where he will be
well taken care of.
Oh, no.
No, no!
No!
OK, OK, I'll tell you.
Let them go.
I'll talk.
OK, let her go home.
You, over there.
Take this down.
What do you want to know?
- About Duke Malloy.
- Who was he?
He was a schlammer.
You know, a strung-out.
Who did he work for?
For the troop.
For them.
Who's them?
Talk sense.
- Where do you hang out?
- At Olga's lunch stand.
- Anybody else there?
- We all hang out there.
- Duke, too?
- Sure, that's how I got in.
Duke was the one
who took me there.
It was a big day for me.
They had seen me
in the neighborhood,
and now they were
sending for me.
But I wondered why Duke
was taking me to Olga's.
I was sure excited,
because now I was finally
getting in with the real boys.
It's me, Duke.
Back room was just like what
you'd expect of the back of a store.
Shorty, that dope...
and Philadelphia,
he wasn't all there.
But nobody ever said that
when he was around.
Vince, a bundle of nerves
with no brain.
Then there behind the desk,
all nerve and all brain,
Mr. Rico.
Is this the guy you wanted?
Sit down.
Over there.
What are you looking at?
Open up, it's Digger.
- Digger!
- Hi.
When did you get back?
Just now.
How did it go?
Took a few days to get
the sucker in position.
You know, I think he had
a feeling he was gonna go.
Always stayed in crowds.
But I nailed him one afternoon...
Bijou Theater, back row.
Quick.
That checks.
The Miami cops found him
in the Bijou Theater.
Here's your bonus.
Say, who was this guy?
Did it make the papers?
Any time you want to know,
I'll have the cops read it to you.
Sit down.
Hello?
Where has it got to be done?
Can't they handle it?
Mmm.
When?
Yeah.
Right.
Right.
Who calls him on the phone?
If you're a good swimmer,
you can ask the guy
who found out.
He's at the bottom of the river.
Digger...
you ever been in St. Louis?
No.
I've been to St. Louis.
I didn't ask you.
I ain't had a contract
in 2 months.
You're getting paid.
But an out-of-town
contract is extra dough.
I got expenses.
You need a rest!
You're coming apart.
You capiche?
So-so.
The finger don't
speak much english.
He can point, can't he?
Here's a yard.
You grab a plane...
at midnight.
When you finish,
don't hang around to
see any ball games.
You all set?
Let me see that.
Who told you you
could carry a gun?
It's mine.
That's fine.
Makes it easy for the
cops to identify you
if they grab you.
You know what to use.
Use it.
Now get going.
When is he gonna talk to me?
Pick up the cards.
Leave them there.
You pick up the cards.
What's your name?
Big Babe Lazich.
You sent for me, remember?
I'm forgetful.
Sometimes I meet a guy,
and then I never see him again.
I got a big turnover in friends.
A blimp like you ain't got
a girlfriend, have you?
I got a wife.
Well...
if anything happens to you,
we take care of her.
You get in a jam,
we get you a lawyer.
If you get in jail,
you're on the payroll
all the time you're in.
There's your first week's pay.
Thanks, Mr. Rico.
Now I'm ready
for the big stuff.
Maybe even a killing.
Don't ever say that.
A murder's a contract.
The hit is the sucker
that gets killed.
Remember those words
and use them.
Then, even if the cops
tap a phone,
they don't know what
you're talking about.
- Got that?
- Yes, sir.
- Anything else?
- Yes.
Burn that tent you're wearin'
and get yourself a suit.
Get this through your head,
you're new here.
You're nothin'!
Takin' orders from everybody.
From him, and him, and me.
Now, pick up the cards.
Well, that's what I was:
A nothin'.
I've never been anything
but a nothin'.
Nelson speaking.
Send out an A.P.B.
On Joseph Rico.
Stamp it number one.
Pick up Olga Kirshen
and move in on that
lunch stand quick.
Check the telephones.
Get all the long-distance
toll sheets.
Find out who the landlord is
and check who pays the rent.
So, you're just a nothing?
Then how did you make Duke
kill Nina Lombardo?
Me? I didn't! I didn't
make him kill her!
You better tell me,
or I'll hand you an
accessory to murder rap.
Me? I didn't do nothin'!
I didn't kill anyone!
I just drove away with the body.
Where'd you take it?
Where'd you take the body?
Where they told me.
I'll show you.
- Woman.
- Woman.
- Caucasian.
- Caucasian.
Age, early twenties.
Weight, about 110 pounds.
110 pounds.
Height, 5 feet, 3 inches.
5 feet, 3 inches.
Hair, black.
Eyes...
- Brown.
- Brown.
Is that Nina Lombardo?
Don't make me look.
Is that Nina Lombardo?
That's her.
Hey, captain,
here's something I found
on the steering wheel.
Car's registered
to Thomas O'Hara,
1510 Elm Street,
Fort Morris.
That's over the state line.
Yeah, about 60 miles.
I'll get in touch
with their police.
Have 'em pick up O'Hara
and hold him for us.
Mr. Ferguson.
Did you pick up O'Hara?
Right off the sidewalk.
He was shot.
- Is he alive?
- Just about.
Something...
went wrong.
I had a feeling...
something was...
wrong.
Duke...
it was all Duke's fault.
- Duke...
- O'Hara?
- Duke.
- O'Hara?
He got me in all this trouble.
What was Duke's fault?
Tell me about Duke.
He should've filled a contract.
I found her.
I did my job.
He should've done his.
I showed him the hit.
I took him to see her.
Just muscatel.
There's the hit.
The dame?
Does it make any difference?
No difference.
Did you get a good look at her?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Listen, I'm going down
after the cleaning.
And I washed your socks out.
They're hanging in the bathroom.
Oh, thanks.
That's her girlfriend.
They live together
up on the second floor
and work over at
edison's leather goods.
When this dame goes,
it's very important
that nobody should know about it.
She just disappears, see?
You got a quiet spot
for that around here?
A couple of nice, romantic lakes
just outside of town.
You shouldn't have any trouble,
good-lookin' guy like you.
I'll go in a couple of days.
Don't crowd me.
A job like this is gonna
take a little time.
Where you been?
I ain't seen you in weeks.
I gotta talk to you.
Slip in here.
Long distance want action?
Yeah. I want
action, too.
You been here
3 weeks, kid. Go on.
Who do you think
you're talking to?
Local talent?
You know how many
contracts I've filled?
I keep the number
right in my head.
Would you like me to tell you?
No. I don't want to know.
15.
And I never left
a trace. You know why?
Because I handled 'em
my own way.
Nobody tells me how.
Or when.
OK. Handle it your own way.
I like you.
You know something,
I really like you.
- Yeah, that's great.
- Me, too.
I'm gonna buy you a drink.
You love that grape, don't you?
We're gonna be friends.
Stop worryin'. She goes
tomorrow night at 11:00.
Wait downstairs.
You didn't do it.
Why didn't you do it?
What'll happen to us
when they find out?
They're not gonna find out.
You fell for her.
You're gonna call long distance.
You're gonna say I did the job.
You're never gonna
get away with it.
And you're gonna say it
so they believe you.
They'll get you.
They'll get both of you.
They'll have to find us first.
But they'll find me.
What about me?
Here's 1,000 bucks.
You can run a long way with this.
Now, make the call.
No.
Make the call.
I did what Duke asked.
I called long distance.
Then I ran.
We all ran.
But we didn't get very far.
They caught up with us.
With Duke.
With the girl.
And with me.
That's enough.
A young girl.
A nice girl.
Working in a shop,
bothering nobody.
Why would anybody want her dead?
Why?
Maybe her roommate can tell us.
Nina dead?
How did it happen?
Was there an accident?
No, it wasn't an accident.
She was murdered.
Did you ever see this man before?
That's the man
she went away with.
They were going to be married.
Well, he killed her.
Do you know why anybody'd
wanna kill nina? Can you think
- of anybody who'd have a motive?
- No. No, I don't know.
I'm sorry to upset you
like this, Miss Davis,
but we think perhaps
you're the only one
who can help us.
What do you know about Nina?
Who was she?
Where'd she come from?
She came from out of town.
I met her at the store.
We like each other. We
took this room together.
She ever tell you
anything about herself?
About her past?
About her friends?
No.
She never talked
about anything personal.
Come to think of it,
there was something.
Her name.
Well, what about her name?
She changed it.
I think it was Vetto.
Angela Vetto.
Do you know why
she changed her name?
No.
There was something
she was afraid of.
She never did tell me all of it.
It had something to do
with her father.
Yeah?
What about her father?
He's dead.
That's all I know
about it. That's all.
Thank you, Miss Davis.
Sorry to have troubled you.
Oh, uh,
Miss Davis, uh,
I wouldn't leave town.
I might want to talk to you.
Yes, of course.
Here's the only Vetto
we've got: Tony Vetto.
"Tony Vetto, presumed dead.
"Reported missing 2 years ago
by his daughter Angela Vetto."
Well, that helps.
Any criminal record
on Tony Vetto?
None.
Wait a minute.
Here's something.
Once reported a murder he saw.
A man named John Webb.
Ran an all-night diner
over on 25th street.
Happened 10 years ago.
Tony and his 12-year-old
daughter Angela
saw the killing take place.
Murder weapon was a carving knife.
Listed as unsolved homicide.
Well, looks like Miss Davis
is telling the truth.
Her story checks.
Want a copy of this?
You send it to my office.
Get me Whitlow.
Well, now, we know why
Tony and Angela are dead.
They saw a murder.
Whoever did it was making sure
they'd never talk.
That happened years ago,
and there doesn't seem
to be any motive.
Whitlow? Nelson.
You got a lead on Rico yet?
How about Olga Kirshen?
Well, keep after 'em.
They gotta be someplace.
Why would a gang like this
kill a fella who runs a diner?
Doesn't make sense.
Well, we're making headway.
We know a contract means a murder,
and a hit means a victim.
Now we've gotta find out
who gives out the contracts.
Rico?
No. He takes orders.
This is big, well-organized.
An organization of killers.
A business built on murders.
Mm-hmm.
Murder for profit.
Yeah?
Who?
Oh, yes, doctor.
Oh, say, do me a favor.
Don't release him to anybody
until I get there.
That was the asylum.
Someone's tryin'
to spring Philadelphia.
Look, doc, I can't
go with those guys.
I got no family. I got no friends.
I got... I got nobody
to take me out of here
and put me in a private place.
I-I-I can't go.
It's a trick.
They're tryin' to get me.
I won't go.
Well, you don't
have to go with them,
but the city has to release you.
You're perfectly lucid.
If I walk out of here,
I'm a dead pigeon.
They'll get me.
You tell me
what I want to know,
and I'll hold you as
a material witness.
If you don't, we'll let you go.
Now, I asked you once before,
why did Duke Malloy
kill his girl?
I don't know.
What do you know
about Angela Vetto?
I never heard of her.
Rico? Tony Vetto?
I don't know any of them.
OK, doc, kick him out.
Now I done something.
You can lock me up for assault.
That won't work, Zaca.
You can't let me go out
and get killed.
You want us to help you,
you help us.
Start talking.
That last name you mentioned...
Tony Vetto...
I do remember.
But I just drove
the laundry truck.
I had nothin' to do
with nothin' else.
Now, what about
the laundry truck?
I picked up the truck
and drove it to where
Rico told me to.
Get back there.
We're not ready.
I just want to tell you
I got the truck outside.
Mr. Rico, listen to me.
You can't pull anything in here.
Who says I can't?
This is my shop.
And you're runnin' my book in it,
so you'll take my orders.
There's a customer
on his way over.
An old customer.
- Tony Vetto.
- No.
Not Tony.
It's too late for him.
I was closing up when...
we know he's on his way over.
You'll stay open for him.
Please. Please.
When he comes,
he'll sit in this chair.
He'll buy his regular
saturday night shave.
You'll put the apron on him.
You'll put hot towels on his face.
Remember that I'll be right there.
Start to strop the razor.
- Then I take over.
- No.
No, no.
I can't do it.
He's my friend.
You'll do it.
Here he comes.
Am I too late for a shave, Louis?
It's late.
Aw, come on.
You got time for one
more for an old friend.
You know, a funny thing
happened this morning.
Who do you think
gets into my cab?
I could swear
it was the same guy
that killed poor Mr. Webb.
You remember the coffee shop of
where I saw it happen, me and Angela?
You think I ought
to go to the cops?
You must have made a mistake.
It couldn't be the same guy.
It was no mistake.
It was him, all right.
Listen, I could
never forget that face.
I think he remember me, too.
Yeah, I think I better
go to the police.
Philadelphia.
Step on it.
We got to meet the undertaker.
How can a guy get that way?
They ain't all that strong
like you and me, kid.
I just ain't been
feeling well lately.
Barbara took it better than you.
I'm all right now.
Yeah. I'm all right.
Sure. I ain't worried
about you, Vince.
We used to go to
the same p.s. Together.
That's right.
I knew you wouldn't
forget about things like that.
Nah. With a guy
going to pieces like you,
can ruin the whole
discipline. It happens.
You know, Vince,
I think there's room
for you in that basket.
You got a package for me?
2 of them.
Busy night.
You keeping count, you...
get going.
That's the truth.
I had nothing to do with it.
I just drove.
What about Louie the barber?
Was he one of your gang?
Nah. He's dead and
buried 2 years ago.
Legitimate.
Who's the man
you delivered the bodies to?
The undertaker.
What undertaker?
Our undertaker.
He worked for us exclusive.
- What's his name?
- I don't know.
We called him sad eyes.
Where do we find him?
If I tell you, you won't make me
leave here, will you?
What's the address?
261/2 12th street.
Have your men cover the front.
Wait a minute.
Try the window.
No shooting.
I want him alive.
Answer me straight,
or I'll blow your head off.
Where are the bodies?
In the marsh.
Cuff him up,
sergeant.
He says the bodies
are in the marsh.
Get the city
engineers over.
Have them send out
steam shovels
and dig up
that whole area
where we found
the station wagon.
How many bodies
do you think we'll find?
I'm afraid to guess.
Any outfit that has
its own undertaker
is operating on
a pretty big scale.
Identify any of the others?
Whoever did these jobs
is very thorough.
An attempt has been made
to remove all identification.
Here's the list of victims
we know so far.
Doesn't make any sense.
They were all kinds of people.
No connection.
Just doesn't make
any sense at all.
Well, one thing makes sense.
If you haven't got a body,
you can't prosecute for murder.
Somebody went to a lot of trouble
to make sure these
would never be found.
Murder for profit.
I want the guys
who got paid for all this.
The boys in the press room
are getting restless.
What'll I tell them?
Give them the story.
Give the papers their names,
addresses, and pictures
of everybody we've identified.
Spread it around.
Blast it over the radio,
and make them think
we got 100 leads.
Give somebody a bad time.
Somewhere, someone will crack.
But I got to get out of here.
I got to get out of the country.
But they found the bodies.
They're still counting them.
Now they can pin murder on us.
Sure. It's a great hideout
until they find it.
And if they find me,
they find you, too.
Yeah.
OK.
OK. If that's what you want.
I'll stay right here.
Yeah.
Right here.
Digger...
what was that call about?
Long distance again.
What'd they want?
There's a contract to
be filled right away.
A contract now?
- Where?
- In the city.
The cops'll be on our neck
before we get over the city line.
The heat's on too heavy.
I said there's a contract
to be filled in the city!
Shorty and I stay here
and take care of the chickens.
All right.
I'll fill it myself.
I'll take care of
you 2 when I get back.
Car coming!
Rico?
I can't tell, but if he
wants to make trouble...
we'll give him trouble.
- I'm going upstairs.
- Sit down.
Help me out.
Sit down.
It's Herman and B.J.
From Kansas City.
Light the light.
Rico, open up.
Herman, come on in.
What are you doing here?
Hello, Digger.
That's Olga and shorty.
There's a lot of heat on.
Where's Rico?
We got to see him.
He had a contract.
He went into town.
This is no time
to be filling contracts.
Has he flipped his lid?
Yeah. That's what I told him.
You told him?
- Yeah. We told him.
- Didn't we, shorty?
You see? Everything's coming apart.
The country's on fire.
Yeah. We're going to stay here
until somebody
puts out that fire.
I don't blame you.
You see, there's been
a change in the whole setup.
Everything's coming
out of Kansas City now.
What do you mean Kansas?
What happens to us?
You don't have to worry.
You're going to be taken care of.
Aah!
Hello, District attorney's office?
Let me speak to Ferguson, quick.
This is Joe Rico.
Yeah. That's what I said.
Joe Rico.
Hello, Ferguson.
I hear you been looking for me.
Never mind where I am.
I got something to say to you
that you want to hear.
And if you want to hear it,
meet me at pier 16 in...
in an hour.
Yeah. 9:00.
And listen...
no guns, no cops, no tricks.
If you're smart,
you can be a hero.
If you're dumb, you can be dead.
Ah, it's 2 minutes to 9:00.
I'll get going.
Don't you think
I better go with you?
He said alone and unarmed.
That means you get in the car,
and get out of the neighborhood.
Hold it!
You followed us pretty good.
What's on your mind, Rico?
Not so fast.
First, we got to make a deal.
No jail.
What's your offer?
How do I know I can trust you?
You got no choice.
Suppose I give you the top man?
Your boss?
The man who calls you on the phone?
You know about that, eh?
Who is he?
I take orders from a guy
by the name
of Albert Mendoza.@
And I can give him
to you for murder.
That's what I want.
I want him in the chair.
I'm the one guy
that can put him there.
Go ahead.
You ever hear about a poor slob
named John Webb?
What about him?
That's the one mistake
Mendoza ever made.
He killed him personally.
Can you prove it?
- In spades.
- How?
I was there.
Mendoza and me are very close.
I've been with him
ever since the beginning.
At that time, I was just a crumb.
I was working for the bookies.
You know, keeping things
nice and peaceful.
This guy Mendoza was chiseling in
on my boss.
Trying to run
a little book of his own.
I was sent around to have
a little talk with him.
Now, listen.
Here's the message, Mendoza.
Stay out of this neighborhood.
The boss don't want
no competition, understand?
I've been gone over by experts,
but you're the best.
What's your name?
What's the matter?
You want some more?
I think I can use a guy like you.
You kidding?
Help me up.
I'll make you a rich man.
You must be nuts.
I'm glad I ran into you.
You're just the kind
of a guy I need.
Come on.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
I still got a dime left.
When you get to know me better,
you'll find out I'm a great man.
My only trouble is
I was born too late.
By the time I came around,
everything was sold up.
The only chance for a guy like me
is to start a new racket.
And I got one.
A brand-new one.
One nobody ever
thought of before.
I must have kicked you
in the head.
I've given it a lot of thought.
The business I got
needs no investment.
You can carry it
around in your hat.
All you need is a telephone.
I don't see no money
in a hat and a telephone.
What job always
pays the highest?
The most dangerous one.
Yeah.
Today, I went into the most
dangerous business in the world.
What's that?
The murder business.
But I'm taking
the danger out of it.
You're really nuts.
Look...
how do the cops always
catch a murderer?
They find a motive.
Once they find a motive,
they've got the killer.
I don't get it.
All right.
Take this guy here.
Who'd want to kill him?
- I don't know.
- Who?
Not many people.
His partner, if he's got one.
Guy who owes him money,
fellow he had an argument with.
Maybe his wife.
You see, it's easy for the cops.
They've only got 4 or 5
people to look for.
4 or 5 people
who have got a motive.
But any one of them
might want to see him dead.
That's where we come in.
We service these people
with a killer who's
got no motive.
He won't even know the guy,
so how can the cops find him?
Yeah, but who pays?
The customer.
That's where it goes wrong.
How can you trust him?
He's got you.
No.
We got him.
He is the one with the motive.
That's how we get big.
Once you do a favor
like that for a man,
he's in your hands forever.
He's like a bank.
You're talking through that head
you got your business in.
Yeah?
What do you think I'm doing here?
This is my first contract.
I'm getting 500 bucks to...
you'll never have 500 bucks
as long as you live.
Huh? Unh!
Let's get out of here.
Aah!
Don't run! Walk!
We gotta get out of here.
If you run, then
somebody runs after you.
Walk! Slowly.
But they saw us.
They'll tell them
what we look like.
Can you describe them?
Sure. A man and a kid.
They'll say 2 men.
They'll come after us.
Why us?
We got no motive.
We didn't even take anything.
But they saw us!
They'll know us!
That kid...
lookin' at us
with her big blue eyes.
She'll remember.
They don't know us.
We know them.
Their names will be in the papers
tomorrow morning, not ours.
He had nerves like iron.
He never even lost a night's
sleep over that killing.
Then one day a few years later,
he got into a cab.
And who was driving?
Tony Vetto...
the guy who saw him kill Webb.
He knew by the way that he looked
at him that Tony remembered.
It was a cinch
to stop him remembering.
But that scared the kid,
and she ran out of town.
It took us a little while
to find her.
She had grown up
and changed her name.
But we did.
And then there were
no witnesses left.
Only me.
And do you know why?
Because I'm smart.
I'm even smarter than Mendoza.
That's why I'm
the only guy alive
who can give him to you for murder.
And he's dead.
Mendoza had quite an idea.
A lunatic idea, but it worked.
Outside's a great big country.
Mendoza has robbed it
and murdered its citizens.
We can't touch him.
Heh.
I guess it was just a wish I had
running through my head.
Yes, sir, that butcher
is going out of here a free man.
Right over the bodies
of his victims.
On the way out, he'll
spit right in our eye.
Heh.
Maybe, but for
the next few hours,
I've still got my hands on him.
He's not gonna spit in my eye.
If you came here
to tell me about Rico,
you can save your breath.
I already heard.
I've got a few souvenirs for you,
pictures of some people you killed.
Little memories
you can hang on to.
I'll have a better memory.
You, looking like a chump
in that courtroom today.
If you think you can get away
with this, you're crazy.
You think you can shut people up
by killing them, but you're wrong.
Even the dead can talk.
Maybe not in a courtroom,
but they'll be talking
to you, Mendoza...
tonight, when
you're trying to sleep.
I don't have to listen to you.
Get out of here.
Sit down!
Look at these faces.
Faces of the dead, Mendoza.
Olga Kirshen, shot.
Duke Malloy, hanged.
Tony Vetto, poor taxi
driver, stabbed.
And Angela Vetto,
a little girl you hounded from
childhood until you killed her.
Look at her, Mendoza!
Maybe this is a face
that will haunt you!
Maybe these are the eyes
that will drive you crazy!
Guard! Guard!
I want to get in touch
with my lawyer.
I want to get in touch
with him right away.
Hello?
Just a minute.
It's Mendoza's lawyer.
He wants you.
Hello?
Yeah.
Yeah, ok.
Right away.
We got a contract in Fort Morris.
A rush job right
from the head man.
They were standing
in the doorway...
a cab driver and a kid.
They saw him do it.
The knife was still in his hand.
And Mendoza saw them, too.
Still playing that thing?
I was just imagining
how nice it would be
if Rico were on the
stand saying this.
Well, he's dead.
That thing isn't evidence.
...dirty, fat face.
And the girl...
staring at him
with her big blue eyes.
He threw down the knife,
but I was already running
for the door.
I ran out in the street.
He caught up with me
and grabbed me by the arm.
Cab driver
with a dirty, fat face
and the girl staring at him
with her big blue eyes.
...girl staring at him
with her big blue eyes.
He threw down the knife...
her big blue eyes.
Where's that coroner's report
on Nina Lombardo?
Woman, caucasian, aged early 20s.
Height, 5 foot 3.
Weight, 110.
Hair, black.
Eyes, brown.
Brown eyes!
That's what was running
through my head!
Nina Lombardo had brown eyes!
Angela Vetto had big blue ones!
Brown, blue, what are
you getting at?
The finger man pointed out
the wrong girl,
and Duke killed the wrong girl!
The one they wanted
was her roommate,
the one we talked to.
I knew she was lying
about something!
She's Angela Vetto!
Hey, this is Ferguson.
I want a postponement.
4 hours.
Yes, I've got a witness,
an eyewitness!
We can put Mendoza in the chair.
Is Teresa Davis in?
I'd like to speak to her.
Teresa?
Well, she just left.
Which way did she go?
Down the street.
There was a couple
of other men here
a few minutes ago
looking for her.
What did they look like?
I didn't notice.
Just 2 men.
There's 2 guys after her.
Get moving.
We'll never find her this way.
Get out of the car.
You take that side.
Can you hook up a mic
to that loudspeaker
so I can talk through it?
I beg your pardon?
Attention, everybody.
Attention.
This is the police.
Angela Vetto...
I repeat, Angela Vetto...
your life is in danger.
Wherever you are,
get off the street.
Angela Vetto, get off the street.
Do not come here.
Go to a telephone.
Call temple 2-3-1-1.
I repeat, temple 2-3-1-1.
Angela Vetto,
get off the street.
Your life is in danger.
Call temple 2-3-1-1.
Stay where you are.
Call temple 2-3-1-1.
We'll come and get you.
The hoods heard that, too.
We pick up Angela,
we lead them right to her.
We'll have to take that chance.
Yes?
Yes, this is the police.
Where are you?
Repeat that.
Stay there.
I'll be right over.
Where's the Talbot building?
Up in the next block.
You take these men
and go in the opposite direction.
Circle around the block.
That'll draw them off.
I'll wait here a few seconds,
and then I'll pick her up myself.
But suppose they don't
fall for it and follow you?
I'll have to risk that.
Here, you better take
a friend with you.
OK, come on, break it up.
Go on home, the lot of you.
It's all over.
Go on. Break it up.
Don't come out.
Stay there.
All right, Miss Vetto, come on out.
You have a date in court.
I want to see that smile
fade on Mendoza's face
when he looks into those
big blue eyes again.
