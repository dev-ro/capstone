Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie! Eddie!
In the summer of '63, On The Dark Side
was the number one song in the country.
It's even bigger now.
That's Joann Carlino.
She was Eddie's girl.
Sally plays the bass.
Wendell on sax.
Kenny on drums.
Guy on piano was Frank Ridgeway.
He wrote all their lyrics.
Called him the Wordman.
Wendell...
That was August of 1963.
Died of a heart attack.
He was only 37.
March 15, 1964.
It was a little after 5 a.m.
Eddie's car went off the Raritan Bridge.
Must've been a hell of an accident.
Who says accident?
You saying he was murdered?
Could've been a suicide.
All right, so what's our hook gonna be?
What about the idea that Eddie's still alive?
You mean "Eddie lives"?
It's possible. They never found his body.
I get it.
Eddie swam away from the car,
Had Jim Morrison waiting for him on shore,
And then Amelia Earhart
flew them both to Paris
Where they're all living together in sin.
Look, there are a lot of holes in this story.
Now, something was
going on with that group,
something that nobody
knows anything about.
Get to the point, Maggie.
Did you ever hear of a poet
named Arthur Rimbaud?
French lit. 105. It was required.
OK, kiddies,
You want to sit back
in your seats and listen?
Sure.
"A season in hell.
"A spiritual and
confessional autobiography.
"Arthur Rimbaud was a genius.
"His writings were a quest.
"A search for perfection.
"An attempt to find totalfreedom.
"At the age of 19,
"Arthur Rimbaud committed suicide,
Not of the flesh,
but of the mind and soul."
What's that supposed to mean?
It means he never wrote another word
and disappeared off the face of the earth.
He was not seen nor heard from again
for nearly 20 years,
until he reappeared in a hospital in Marseilles
on his deathbed.
Maggie, it's a terrific story.
I just don't see
what this has got to do with Eddie Wilson.
You know where Eddie was coming from
the night of the accident?
He was coming from a recording studio
where he just finished taping an album.
You know what thename
of that album was?
A season in hell.
So what you're saying
is that Wilson's pulling a Rimbaud?
I don't know, but if he is,
we've got ourselves one hell of a story,
don't we, guys?
You think you can get your hands
on those tapes?
I went to Satin Records yesterday.
I figure that the master had to be sitting
in their vault.
I wondered why they never
released this album.
You know what I found out?
The tapes are missing.
Someone checked them out on March 16...
1964.
The day after Eddie supposedly died.
And that's going to be our hook.
... On the Jersey side of the Holland tunnel,
The Jersey turnpike, and the-
Back on the charts again,
Eddie and The Cruisers,
doing Wild Summer Nights
from their hit album, Tender Years.
And this is Scott Muni at N.E.W.
Hey, mr. Ridgeway!
Hey, nice catch.
"... And so I dared to hope...
"Though changed,
no doubt, from what I was
"when first I came among these hills.
"When like a roe,
I bounded o'er the mountains
"by the sides of the deep rivers
and the lonely streams,
"wherever nature led.
"More like a man
"flying from something that he dreads
and one who sought the thing he loved."
So, what's Wordsworth getting at?
He's saying that places stay the same,
but people change.
OK, do people change, or don't they?
Now that's worth talking about.
All right. Have a nice weekend.
And remember, I don't want
to see any of your faces
for at least 48 hours.
The Big Time!
Hi.
Hi.
Can I help you guys?
Yeah. Tell Tony
Eddie and The Cruisers are here.
All Right!
Yeah! All Right.
Wendell, you're on
the keyboards on this one.
Hey, Big Bopper, where you going?
You gotta listen to my new song.
You're the one who knows whatgoes.
Hey, Sally, never bullshit a bullshitter.
You make the music. I make the deals.
Get some sleep.
Let's get on with the music.
1, 2...
1, 2, 3, 4!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
What's the matter?
Where you racing to?
Where's the fire?
No fire. That's the way the song was written.
It goes that way-
upbeat.
What's the problem?
The problem is I'm just saying words.
You know, you gotta give me a little room,
So people know what I'm singing about.
You lose the beat, people miss a step.
We want 'em to dance.
Lose a beat, miss a step...
What are you, a moron, Sal?
You believe this guy?
Look, Sal, I like your stuff,
but it just ain't what I was looking for.
You understand?
Forget it. You had your mind made up
before you even started.
So what am I knocking myself out for?
Look, I don't want to argue with you, Sal.
You want to get another
opinion on the subject?
No! Forget it.
Joann, what do you think?
What are you askin' her for?
Why not ask her?
She's got a brain.
I don't know anything?
She knows, huh?
Everybody you bring in this
Band's an expert except Sally.
Sally's just a dumb guinea, right?
You dumb guinea.
Hey, kid, come here.
Who, me?
Yeah, you. Come here.
Now, you heard what we're talking about.
What do you think?
Well, I think he's right.
I think it needs a caesura.
See? My way, with a caesarean.
A what?
Tell him.
What's your name?
Frank.
Tell him, Frankie.
A caesura?
That's a timely pause,
a kind of a strategic silence.
That's exactly right.
If you want, I'll give you an example.
Ahem. OK.
"One evening
"I took beauty in my arms,
"And I thought her bitter,
And I insulted her."
Sounds like shit, right?
OK, wait a minute.
Now I'll do it with the caesura.
"One evening I took beauty in my arms...
"And I thought her bitter...
And I insulted her."
Now, that's got class.
Does that have class, Sally? Right?
Hey, kid, you can stay.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Can I help you?
Maggie Foley.
I work for Media Magazine.
I'm doing a story on Eddie Wilson.
I thought you might be of some help.
Well...
What do you want to know?
Well, I'd like you to tell me about the past.
I want to know what it was like
to be a Cruiser.
Miss, uh...
Maggie.
I'm sorry. It's nothing personal in this.
I'd like to help you.
I really would, but...
Frank, there are a lot
of unanswered questions
about that day.
Yeah, well, I understand
what you're up against,
but that was then, and this is now.
I don't care to be interviewed.
Look, Frank,
I'm not here to make
a carnival out of your life.
Now, I have something
very different in mind.
I am going to do a tribute
to a group of guys
who were ahead of their time.
You don't understand.
The night Eddie died,
The Cruisers died with him.
Frank, what happenedthat last night
at the recording studio,
the night that Eddie died?
There's no way on earth
I'd go into that with you.
Frank, why not?
Maybe...
Maybe because Eddie's dead,
And I'm alive.
He was my friend,
and you, I just met.
Hello.
Wordman!
Who is this?
This is the Master of Voices,
Maker of Choices - your old buddy.
You don't remember.
Doc?
Hey there, Wordman,
Say there, Wordman,
whatever happened to you?
What you been up to?
It's been a long time, Doc.
It sure has, Kid.
So, uh, what's up?
You need me, Wordman.
You need me bad.
Is that right?
We got to talk.
How soon before you
get your ass over here?
Well, where are you?
Right back where we started, Kid -
Asbury Park.
All Right, you Near-Beer Fans,
remember Mock-Bird, Ing-Bird,
Charlie and Inez Fox, summer '63?
Well, James Taylor and Carly Simon
are betting you don't.
My man, my man, the Wordman!
Long time, Kid.
Doc, how you been?
The hits just keep on coming.
Hey, you haven't changed much.
Still a kid.
Don't bother returning the compliment.
Give me that stuff, will you, Frank?
Sit down.
Hey, man, this joint
ain't as bad as it looks.
I mean, the pay ain't bad.
You can't beat the hours.
Besides, there's a College nearby.
They're telling me I'm becoming
quite a cult figure around here.
Doc, that's great.
So, did you ever write that book?
No.
I never got around to it.
So, what did you ask me here for?
What's so urgent?
You talk to that chick from Media Magazine?
Guessyou know what's been happening
with The Cruisers lately.
Something's busting, Kid,
and it's busting fast.
The way I see It, Eddie's my ticket out...
and yours.
Doc...
We did one album, 12 Cuts.
You're making a big deal out of nothing.
I'll tell you about nothing.
Nothing's what we got on
the reissue of the old album.
After Eddie died,
I sold the rights all back
to Lew Eisen, that bastard.
Remember him?
There's nothing I can do about that now.
But this movie thing, man...
You heard about the movie deal, right?
The Eddie Wilson Story.
The way I see it, they got
to have a script, right?
They got to have locations,
period stuff, stuff like that.
That's where we come in-
Technical Consultants.
They got to come to us.
I mean, who else they got?
And there's more.
There's got to be parts
in there for both of us.
I mean, not that we should
necessarily play ourselves.
Doc, it sounds like you can't miss.
I wish you all the luck in the world.
Hey, Kid...
I guess I lost my touch.
I can't convince you, who can I convince?
Listen, Frank, give me a ride home.
My car's kind of out of Commission.
Besides, there's something
I wanna show you.
Sure, Doc.
Any way you wanna play.
I was thinking, Frank.
Hmm?
I mean, it's just an idea.
I know you're Ggonna hate it.
What is it?
I was thinking about bringing
the group back together.
"Eddie and The Cruisers,
featuring Sal Amato,
appearing nightly at 8:00 and 11:00."
Dig this.
I checked him out last week.
He's got this Eddie Wilson look-alike.
No, he ain't half-bad.
He's starting to make a little
noise, but you know Sally.
The kid's a nickel and dime operation.
Now, here's my plan.
I figure we get rid of the losers
and bring on The Cruisers.
You, the clone, Sally, Kenny,
some dude on sax, and the chick...
Joann.
Yeah, right, Joann.
I hear she's back, you know?
She was out in Vegas.
Caesar's Palace.
Where is she now?
Over around Wildwood.
I hear she's choreographing
at one of the big hotels
on the Boardwalk.
I get the group back together, right?
Get a little seed money,
get some publicity, right clothes,
open up at the right joint
at the right time,
and, Frankie, we come back big.
Eddie and The Original Cruisers.
Hey, why not do a James Dean?
Hit the Junkyards,
blowtorch Eddie's car into little pieces
for the tourist trade.
Only do me a favor.
Leave me out of it.
I'm sorry, kid.
It's OK. Forget it.
Shit.
They may look like shacks
on the outside,
But you'll be surprised at the interior.
Maid's day off.
This was waiting for me
when I got home last night.
Looks like we got
the same decorator, Doc.
They got my place this morning.
It's like the old joke.
Hmm?
We might be paranoid,
but it don't mean they ain't after us.
Who is they?
Music lovers.
Why?
We must have something they want.
What?
Can't you figure it out?
No.
Well, try.
What could we have that's worth stealing,
my Robert Hall suit?
Your Wilkinson blades?
Oh, come on, Doc.
Give me a break.
What are they after?
The tapes.
Season In Hell.
A touch of class for Tony Mart's.
Thanks.
What's this?
Poetry?
Yeah.
Rimbaud.
You know anything about him?
Sure.
Um...
He was quite disreputable.
Mean...
Perhaps even ruthless and perverse.
"A tortured soul..."
"But still..."
One of the greatest poets
that ever lived.
Would you like it?
No, thanks.
I got to go.
Here.
Take it with you.
A present.
I'll just borrow it.
OK.
See ya.
Joann was telling me you write music.
Thinks you might be good.
I'll give you a try.
What I want is songs that echo.
The stuff we're doing now is like...
somebody's bedsheets-
spread them out, soil them,
ship them out to laundry, you know?
But our songs...
I want to be able to...
fold ourselves up in them forever.
You understand?
That's the most you'll ever
get out of me, Wordman.
Ever.
Ladies and gentlemen...
The Holiday Inn is proud to present
a group that's been bringing us hits
for nearly 18 years.
How about a big hand
for some Jersey boys
who really nade good -
Eddie and The Cruisers,
featuring Sal Amato!
Hi.
Oh, hi.
I have a table down front.
Would you like to join me?
No...
If Sally knew I was here,
he's just crazy enough
to call me up on stage.
Didn't you tell him you were coming?
I wasn't sure what
his reaction would be.
I interviewed him between shows.
He said some very nice
things about you.
He told me that you were
some kind of genius with words,
regular Whiz Kid.
Frank, why did you come here tonight?
I just wanted to see
how things turned out
for an old friend of mine.
Is that all?
I guess I also wanted to see
how things might've turned out for me.
Can I buy you a drink after the show?
Maybe.
OK.
Not bad.
What?
I said not bad.
Not bad?
Eddie, what's with you?
The kid can't play. He can't sing,
and he can't write.
So what's not bad?
He's got something we need.
Like what?
Words and music, Doc.
Words and music.
All right. Now let's get on with the music.
See what I'm doing?
Do it like I'm doing.
It's rock 'n' roll.
Right? Do that.
No, no. Like this.
Like this.
Relax, loosen up.
Did he say not bad?
Ha ha ha!
All right?
Come on.
Oh, they're right.
I can't do this.
No, man. Now come on.
Just concentrate.
It's easy. It's like getting laid,
Or riding a bike.
Come on.
See? Loosen up.
Get your hands up there.
That's it, come on.
Go!
Go, go!
You got it, Frankie. Yeah.
Yeah!
You got it.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Get down there.
You on vacation, or what?
That was the memory lane
voice of Eddie Wilson,
the original sound of The Cruisers.
I'd like to take you
on another little journey now.
How many of you remember
that old feeling-
sand in your shoes,
ants in your pants,
secret weapon in your wallet?
That's you, right?
Yeah.
How about the feeling
of that magic, magic night?
The first time.
How many of you remember that?
I want to see a show of hands.
Come on.
Ah.
Slow dancing, submarine races...
Hickeys.
How about those wild nights?
You were cruising with your favorite girl.
The top was down, and the music was blasting.
Hmm?
That was the inspiration behind
Wild Summer Nights.
1, 2, 3, 4!
All right.
All right!
All right!
Eddie Wilson is a part of yesterday, sure he is,
But he's as much a part of
this group today as I am.
You know, we're still together, him and me.
And never a day passes
that I don't think he's around somewhere-
out in the street, around the corner,
not far away at all.
The Cruisers with Sal Amato.
Let's give 'em a big hand
once more for this really great group.
Ladies and gentlemen, here they come.
Here they are.
Take a bow, Sally.
OK. Thank you very much.
Don't go away.
Stick around.
There'll be dancing till dawn
to the keyboard sounds of
our very own Regina Lewis.
Thank you.
Son of a bitch.
Son of a bitch.
Look what comes walking
through the door!
Wordman himself!
Just like I've been telling everybody,
When you're hot, you're hot.
Where have you been
hiding yourself, Wordman?
Teaching high school in Vineland.
I never left the Garden State, Sal.
No lie?
No.
Sit down. Sit down.
I used to wonder about you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Ifigured maybe you moved to California,
were writin' for movies
under an assumed name, or somethin'.
Want a beer?
Hey, Thanks.
Mmm... Wordman?
Hmm?
I just got interviewed for television
by Media Magazine.
Yeah.
They had a whole crew here.
They had lights and cameras. Everything.
That's great, Sal.
What did you talk about?
Me.
Are you hungry?
Want a slice?
Nah.
No, no, no, no.
You know what she really
wanted to talk about?
Those old tapes...
Season in hell.
She said something about 'em being missing.
Wanted to know if I knew where they were.
What'd you tell her?
For all I care, they could've
gone down with Eddie.
You understand?
Sally, you were on those tapes, too.
They find those tapes, what's in it for me?
I just about broke my fingers
trying to play that stuff.
Well, they must be worth money.
Somebody's willin' to pay for 'em.
But we ain't gonna see a dime from that.
They'll find a way to screw us.
They always do.
Guys like you and me,
they strike oil under your garden,
all you get is dead tomatoes.
I get the picture.
It's still Eddie, isn't it?
They could care less about me.
It's more Eddie they want.
Ah, Sally.
Hey.
You ever wonder what it
might have been like
if he was still around?
I used to wonder.
It ate me up.
I figured Eddie was
my one shot at the bigs.
I thought we could go
all the way together.
After he died, I got crazy.
Some nights it's like Eddie's still alive...
and I get mad at him all over again.
I'm mad at him for living.
And I'm mad at him for dying...
the dumb way that he did.
Sure, it gripes me
When I think about how
big we could've been.
We signed a $50,000 contract
to do another album.
That was a lot of money in those days.
They gave us a $10,000 advance,
and the offers started pouring in.
They all wanted the Cruisers.
We were on such a high.
We thought we'd never come down.
Anyway, one night Doc was reading off
the list of potential dates,
and I heard him mention Benton College,
my old school.
Nobody wanted to go,
and the money was short.
Also, Eddie felt that it wasn't our kind of place,
that we wouldn't fit in.
But I wanted to go.
Oh, God, how I wanted to go.
Do you believe this?
Oh, man.
I didn't know we were
going to summer camp.
You know, there's 600 guys here
that haven't seen a girl since New Year's.
They bring them by train,
by car, by the busload.
Cattle cars, they call 'em.
Sounds like zoo parade.
Moo!
Whinny!
Round them up!
Move them out!
South Philly was never like this.
Come on, you guys.
Get off my back.
Strike one!
Hello, girls.
Stop it, stop it.
Look at this.
It's an ice cream convention, man.
Oh, they're going to sacrifice a cricket.
No. They're gonna sacrifice you.
How does it feel to be home, Frankie?
Look at this.
What do we have here?
A real group of pistoleros.
Hey, Wordman.
This shindig tonight...
how are we supposed to dress?
Hey, wait a minute.
What's the big deal?
We've played colleges before.
Yeah, sure.
We played St. Something
Down in Delaware,
fairly ridiculous up in Madison,
but we ain't never played
no finishing school like this.
This is a mistake.
We don't belong here.
These people are different.
I'm telling ya, they're gonna eat us up.
They're just a bunch of college kids,
no better than you.
Hey! I didn't say better.
I said different.
You ought to remember that.
What do you think?
What do I think?
I'm scared to death.
Aw, hell, Joann.
Come on.
When I graduated from high school,
I asked my guidance counselor
what he thought I should do.
He talked about being a beautician,
or a typist, or a nurse.
That was already reaching for the moon.
The whole time, he was checking me out.
"Here's a ripe one.
"Doesn't matter what kind of job you get
"Because in a year you'll be
married and pregnant
"With the first of six,
"And they won't be college material
Any more than you are, cookie."
Case closed.
Hey, listen.
These people, they're way behind you.
I don't think they think so.
Hey, Ridgeway! Frank!
What are you doing?
Livingston, how are you?
OK. This is Frank Ridgeway,
My old roommate.
This is Lois Wilkes.
Hi, Lois.
Joann Carlino.
How you doin'?
Keith Livingston.
Nice to meet you.
So, what, are you up for the weekend?
Yeah.
Rites of spring?
Yeah.
Well, that's perfect.
Know who's playing tonight at the dance?
They've got the cruisers.
You know, the mean-assed
black group out of Newark,
The Cruisers.
Oh, yeah.
I heard of them.
You know, when that Lois girl
Asked me where did I go to college,
I didn't know what to say.
You told her you work in the city. Fine.
And whether we were
pinned or lavaliered?
Hey, look...
You're good enough to be here.
You mean I'm good enough for you.
That's it, isn't it?
Sometimes I think you're too good.
How do you know I'm not?
I didn't mean that.
Eddie said "different."
Yeah.
Thanks for the date.
Are you being sarcastic?
No.
You're welcome, then.
Let's go back.
Showtime yet?
I'll just change into my other stuff.
No.
It'll only take a minute.
I said no. You stay like that.
Hey, man.
You got some fine college here.
All the advantages.
You got ivy walls,
lecture halls,
full-dressed balls,
and you got The Cruisers
for the nasty stuff.
For the get-down music
and the hanging tough.
Better grab a woman.
Don't mention your name,
Because after tonight,
she'll never be the same.
When lights go out,
and the clock winds down,
better find me a woman
to go downtown.
No hand-holdin' baby
who'll nip and tuck.
I want a girl up the street
who knows how to...
Do you like rock 'n' roll?
Do you need rock 'n' roll?
All right. Cool out.
Sit down. Sit down.
Come on. We gotta cool out
before we can get runnin'.
I wanna thank you people for making the scene.
The show's just startin' now.
I'm gonna come clean.
I'm gonna present The Cruisers one by one.
On drums, just going through a phase,
Kenny Hopkins.
On sax, the bruiser...
mr. Wendell Newton.
On bass, long, tall Sally Amato.
And last but not least,
your favorite and mine...
Joann Carlino!
Hey, Eddie, you forgot somebody!
Who did I forget?
The guy on the piano!
Ridgeway!
Oh! Oh, yeah.
On piano...
We got, uh...
Toby Tyler.
Stage name, show business nom de plume.
He's that little boy who ran away from home
and joined the circus, isn't he?
He snuck into the tent without a ticket
so he could see all the wild animals inside,
the savage beasts, the clowns, the freaks.
Let's hear it, everybody,
for Toby Tyler!
All right, here we go!
Light up those lights!
The next day,
I told him I was leaving,
And I'd take the bus back.
What did he say?
He said, "OK. Sure, go ahead.
"I'll just call up the union
and have them send someone else over."
Like so much busted plumbing.
Then he asked me to take a walk with him.
He didn't say anything for the longest time.
Then he turned to me, and he said...
"Wordman...
"we need each other.
Words and music."
Then he crossed his fingers
showing how they go together.
"Remember...
words and music."
So you stayed.
Yeah.
I stayed.
But Season In Hell...
Frank, how much influence
did Rimbaud have on Eddie?
Looking for ghosts?
Maybe.
You don't really think Eddie's still alive, do you?
I guess not.
But what about the coincidence
of Season In Hell?
Frank, what happened to those tapes?
Hey, look.
It didn't work.
The record company hated it.
They never released the album.
Frank, I want to get ahold of those tapes
and play them on my show.
Let's let them be heard.
Let the people decide
whether they're any good.
I don't know where they are.
Honest.
I'd like to find them as much as you would.
Frank...
Is that why you stopped writing?
Because they told you
you weren't any good?
Words and music, remember?
Without Eddie,
there wasn't any more music.
Good night, Maggie.
Good night, Frank.
I'm serious.
Doc wants to get Sally's band and us
to go back onthe circuit again.
The guy's out of his head.
It's them old songs, old memories.
They'll make you crazy, man.
Just a phase, huh, Kenny?
Yeah, sure.
We had some fun times for a while, huh?
I liked being on top.
What's not to like?
You're out there in the back of the caddy,
balling some chick, you know.
One of our tunes come on the radio...
Whoa! I mean, who was
better than me, right?
There was something special
about that time, you know?
I miss it.
You don't fool with
the memories, huh, Frankie?
I'm not so sure I can stop.
OK.
OK, but if you're gonna do that,
then you gotta take a look
at the whole story, man.
I mean, there were bad times, too-
the fights, the arguments,
the hassles.
I mean, things, I'm sure,
you've forgotten all about...
Toby Tyler.
Did he play Hell With You that night?
Yeah.
Yeah, right. You remember Sal and Doc
at each other's throats?
Eddie and Joann
not being able to talk to each other.
Nobody talking to each other.
Remember Wendell dying?
Remember that?
I remember.
Yeah, right.
Heart attack, right?
Man, you still don't
know what went down.
What are you talking about?
Where the hell have you been?
Heart attack, my ass!
What, you live in a cloud?
It's time you grew up.
Let's go.
Wendell.
Come on, Wendell, let's go.
We've got to go, man.
Wendell.
Hey, Wendell.
Hey.
Stupid son of a bitch.
Uh...
The other day, I buried
one of my best friends.
He was the best sax player
I ever heard.
And they tell me I gotta come up here
and entertain you people now.
I don't think I'll be able to do that.
Hi.
Hi.
God, you look great.
I just came from a rehearsal.
Still, you look terrific.
I'm so glad youcalled.
I wanted to so many times, but...
Now, this revivial of our music...
I couldn't help thinking about you,
remembering the good times we had.
I just had to see you again, Joann.
We had fun, didn't we, Frank?
Yeah.
You know, I've never
been able to let go.
To let you go.
I'm glad you're here.
Hey! You know, I've seen all the guys.
You did?
Yeah. Kenny's in Atlantic City
dealing blackjack in one of the casinos.
Really?
Yeah. Doc's a DJ back in Asbury Park.
Did you see Sally?
Oh, Yeah. Yeah.
He's knocking them dead
with the oldies but goodies.
Can you believe he's
still playing Betty Lou?
Only now he's finally
doing it his way.
Without the caesura.
Yeah.
How do you feel, them
playing our old songs
on the radio again?
I guess it's fun, but, you know,
the strangest things
have been happening lately.
I keep getting these phone calls.
I pick up the phone,
and someone plays Tender Years.
Then they hang ap.
A couple times a day.
And last week, somebody
broke into my house.
They got my place, too.
And Doc's.
What's going on?
Who is it?
It's got to be those old tapes.
Season In Hell.
What the hell are you doin'?
I've heard enough.
Just relax.
There's nothing can't be fixed.
Am I right?
This won't Ffix.
This is a disaster.
You wanna be a poet?
Try Greenwich Village.
Lew, listen.
Another couple of weeks.
We can work-
Doc, take 6 weeks.
I still wouldn't know what to do with it.
You want to know
what you can do with it?
I'll tell you what you can do with it,
you son of a bitch!
Hey, I put up 10 grand,
and I expect something for my money.
This is what I've been
waiting a year for-
a bunch of jerk-offs
making weird sounds?
You're not gonna see a red penny.
Easy, Eddie.
Now, hey, wait, come on, man.
Hey, listen, Lew,
He's under pressure since Wendell died.
Let me talk to him.
You ain't talkin' to nobody!
Look, we'll work somethin' out.
Bullshit!
Doc, don't do me any favors.
I don't need this.
Lew! Lew! Lew!
Shit!
Are you crazy?
We had the money
in our hands, and you blew it.
You blew it!
Hey, come on!
Eddie...
You're wrong.
You're wrong!
Now listen to me.
I love you.
I've known you
longer than anyone else.
But you're wrong.
They want On The Dark Side!
What are we giving 'em,
some damn opera?
I don't even know what you're after.
I want something great,
I want something that nobody's
ever done before.
Why? We ain't great.
We're just some guys from Jersey.
If we can't be great,
then there's no sense
in ever playing music again, Sal.
I blame this on you.
It was you!
We were doing good
till you came along,
and you got us all screwed up!
Eddie, wait!
Eddie, the music's great.
Those guys are wrong.
It really is.
Eddie, what is this place?
I used to hang out here
when I was a kid.
There used to be this old guy
who owned the place.
What a dreamer.
He would sift through the garbage
and put aside bits and pieces.
Come on. I'll show you.
Come on.
He actually believed
that you could build a castle
out Of a bunch of junk.
What a crock.
Holy shit.
What a phony.
Here we are, guys.
Right where we belong.
You got your Edsels...
Norges...
Dumonts...
and Eddie Wilson.
Together at last,
creating our own incredible monument...
To Nothing.
Here's To Nothing, Fellas!
Here's To Nothing!
There were so many things
I wanted to say to him,
so many questions I wanted to ask.
But Eddie and I, we had a deal.
We never talked about the future.
We thought the present was so fine.
Why ruin it by planning ahead?
But as Eddie drove off,
I knew...
I knew it then...
there wasn't going to be any future.
In the morning,
they told me Eddie was gone.
They hadn't found his body.
That was always
the hardest part to accept.
I know you're gonna think I'm crazy,
but I have to tell you something.
Last night there was a car
sitting in my driveway.
A '57 Chevy.
Just like Eddie's-
Joann, that car was destroyed
in the accident, remember?
I know, but whoever it was
must've seen me
looking out the window.
He blinked his headlights
high, then low, then high again...
just like Eddie.
It can't be.
It can't be him.
Well, who then?
Who?
It's not Eddie.
Whoever it is that's watching
is looking to cash in on those tapes,
but it is not Eddie.
Frank...
I know where those tapes are.
After the accident,
I had to say good-bye
in my own way.
I went to Satin Records,
got the tapes,
and drove back
to Palace Depression.
Take me there.
Watch your head.
Are you there?
Yeah.
Hold my hand.
Come on.
There.
Give me a light.
See it?
I feel something.
It's in a box.
A wooden box.
I got it.
Let's go. Come on.
There's gonna be a left soon.
Just past the gas station.
There's some of you, you know.
Yeah, I see.
That one was always my favorite.
Hello.
Who is this?
Damn it, who is this?
Oh, Frank.
Oh.
No, don't.
It's OK.
It's OK.
That's it!
Huh?
It's Eddie!
He's coming over.
That's our signal.
It means get ready.
I...
I have to go.
He'll be here any minute.
I got to go.
Oh, Frank, I'm sorry.
I got to go.
Eddie.
It is You.
Yes. Yes.
Sure, I have them.
Yes.
I'll be waiting.
Yes. Yes. Eddie.
I'll be alone.
Yes. Oh, hurry.
Please, hurry.
Frank?
Frank!
Hey, Baby, what's the holdup?
Eddie?
Come on, let's
get on with the music.
Frank!
Frank!
What are you doing?
Frank, don't! Don't!
Son of a bitch!
You... you!
OK. OK.
OK, OK.
Why did you do this?
Short cuts, kid.
I never could do things
the easy way.
Oh, Doc.
Why this whole game?
The car business?
I figured...
Joann had the tapes.
I knew she wasn't
gonna give them to me.
Maybe you, Wordman.
Maybe she'd give them to you.
What would you do if you
had the tapes, Doc?
Try me.
Just try me.
I'd have it made.
For once in my life...
I'd bring home a winner.
I'd like that.
I once asked Eddie
why he kept you around.
You know what he said?
He said, "Doc's a dreamer.
and the world needs dreamers."
He was the only
real friend I ever had.
Yeah.
Here.
Go on, kid.
Your ticket to the bigs.
Come on, take them.
I'm gonna do this for all of us.
I mean that.
I'll make you proud of me.
Listen, I'm Gonna
Make The Sweetest Deal
You ever heard.
They don't know it yet,
but they're gonna be
dealing with Doc Robbins,
The big bopper!
And I'm gonna be coming
on strong, staying long.
Talking loud and drawing a crowd.
Hey, man...
Eddie and The Cruisers, coast to coast.
I ain't just talking Jersey!
Go get 'em, Doc!
Let's go inside.
The innocence of the fifties was over,
and so was rock 'n' roll As we knew it.
We were entering a new age.
An age of confusion,
an age of passion, of commitment.
Eddie Wilson saw it coming.
Season In Hell
is a total innovation for its time.
It was a signal
of greatness yet to come.
Eddie Wilson was a step ahead of us,
and I don't think we've
caught up with him yet.
Eddie's been dead for almost 18 years,
but his music is as alive today
as the day he recorded it.
For me and for everyone
who listens to music,
Eddie Wilson lives...
and always will.
Eddie! Eddie!
