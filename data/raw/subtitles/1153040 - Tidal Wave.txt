The Indian Ocean near Indonesia
Keep your eyes open!
Hurry up, guys!
One, two three!
Did they find them?
The Eok-jjo, right?
You're sure?
Don't let them die out there!
Did they find my father?
They did. Don't worry!
- We've got great news, everyone!
- Are they all safe?
Let's get the fucking hell out of here,
you motherfucker!
Man-sik...
Stop it and go.
Just hold on for a little longer!
Sons of bitches! You're not gonna help?
Man-sik!
Yes.
Please take care of Yeon-hee for me, okay?
Don't say that.
I'm getting you out of here.
Get out of here.
Hurry.

Come on, son. Sing. One, two, three.
P/aying is a/ways fun
Gather up, friends
Attaboy, Seung-hyun!
/t's a/ways fun
Yeon-hee! I'm starving!
- Uncle...
- Seung-hyun, here we go.
- Pulling out his tooth?
- Sorry, son.
I won't do it.
- Where's Yeon-hee?
- On deliveries!
Promise!
Man-sik!
- Come out now!
- What?
Yeon-hee!
- What about Yeon-hee?
- Come out!
Hurry!
I told you not to sell here!
I told you very clearly!
Step aside!
Where do you get off trying to sell fish
in front of someone else's
seafood restaurant?
You're right.
What are you doing?
Aren't you gonna apologise?
You got nothing to say, do you?
- You've got nothing to say for yourself?
- No, nothing.
Orphaned children all seem to act like that.
Don't talk that way.
How dare you look at me like that?
Stop glaring at her.
What? You know I'm right!
- When did I ever act like that?
- Stop talking back!
What did you just say?
Did you ever support me
when my parents died?
What? This bitch just doesn't get it.
Say it again!
Stop it, Mom!
Yeon-hee, calm down!
Did you allow her to sell here?
You bastard!
You stupid fool!
You're the chief of the
Prosperity Association!
Why do you always side with her?
That's why she acts like this!
That's not it.
What do you mean, that's not it?
I'm not gonna put up with this any more!
Let's see this till the end.
Mom! Stop it!
Sit!
Everyone, sit down!
I told you not to do that around the arcade.
People see this, you setting up shop
in front of their arcade,
how do you think
it will affect my reputation?
Anyhow, you should show
some respect to your elders.
Your mom should know
how to behave, too!
Yeah, I know.
But even though I want to
give you every convenience,
I never asked for any favours.
I didn't mean it.
Stubborn girl.
Like you representatives all know, Haeundae
is already a world-class resort area.
It doesn't make sense not to have
a single mall in a place like...
Hey, you bastard!
You already made tons of money.
Now you want to destroy this place!
You damn jerk!
Let go, you damned jerk!
Let's move to the next block.
Let go of me! You motherfuckers!
I hate that scumbag.
Professor Kim continues to persist
with his talk of a mega-tsunami,
can we get more specific information?
Before we do that,
you'd better define tsunami jargon.
Would you mind refraining from
using the term "mega-tsunami"?
It makes everyone very uneasy.
In your hypothetical scenario,
a large chunk of islands
break off into the sea,
causing a tidal wave
of unprecedented proportions.
Do you think this is really possible?
I'm suggesting that
because there's a possibility.
Didn't you see what happened
in Southeast Asia and China?
Do natural disasters warn us
that they are coming?
Some say that Korea is
a safety zone from earthquakes.
How many earthquakes above 3.0
do you think we have each year?
An average of more than 30!
Is that what you call
an earthquake safety zone?
Other experts say that
the possibility is very faint.
But you insist there's
a strong possibility of such an occurrence!
All I'm saying is we should
at least form a committee!
Can't you understand what I'm saying?
You should've just married
your earthquakes, not me.
When did you get back in the country?
- Do you actually have some interest in me?
- When did you get here?
Last year.
You could've at least called me.
Oh, what, you've got no hands?
You haven't changed a bit.
You've got me beat.
Heard you're in charge of
the Haeundae Cultural Expo.
You really are a competent person.
- How's Ji-min?
- Now you ask!
She'll be in third grade next year.
Mommy!
Ji-min!
Who's that?
This is a professor that mommy knows.
Say hi.
Hello.
Ji-min, go ahead
and wait in the car with Hae-chan.
Bye.
He's just someone that I met back
in America. We're not together or anything.
I didn't tell her about you.
It's better that way.
There's no need to confuse her.
Hope you understand.
I'd better get going.
- Take care of yourself.
- Okay.
Freak!
You're embarrassing us.
Why don't you just study at home
instead of tagging along on our vacation?
Why didn't you just study harder
on your second try, loser?
People who can't study always act like this.
Stop your nagging!
Get rid of the book now!
The guys aren't approaching us.
That's too hot.
Stop posing like that, dork! Get back here!
How can you be so senseless?
Can't you feel the guys checking me out?
- Who?
- I'm done!
Is it just the three of you?
What do you think?
Is this worth your time?
What number am I, if you add up
all the girls that have been on this yacht
- before me?
- You're the first
to be so stuck up and haughty
on my yacht.
Well, you're not so polite yourself.
Shut up, bitch!
Do you wanna do a round shot?
Nobody better break it up.
Help!
Boy, I feel dizzy.
Help!
Somebody!
Hold tight!
Help!
- Help!
- Let go!
Let go of me!
You're crazy! What are you doing?
Don't! Stop! Stop!
Because you kept grabbing my head.
Who are you?
Yeon-hee!
Yeon-hee!
Yeon-hee!
- What's all this?
- There were some veggies left at the house.
- Where can I put this?
- I don't need this much.
- Just take it.
- Here.
Doctor!
There's been another earthquake
on the sea bed.
- An earthquake on the sea floor!
- Where?
35 km off the west coast of Hokkaido.
- Intensity?
- 3.6.
- Depth?
- An estimated 30 km.
Since it's quiet in Japan,
it's unlikely there'll be a tidal wave.
But something's strange.
What?
The epicentre's been moving toward us
since the beginning of this year.
- I'm sorry to bother you with this.
- No, it's okay.
I'll trust in you, Congressman Park.
I'll go ahead and do all that I can.
But don't think
that everything is settled just yet.
Sometimes things work out,
and sometimes they don't. Am I right?
Let's get going.
- You got everything together all right?
- Yes, I put it in the car trunk.
Crazy bastard!
"Some things don't work out"?
There'll be no approval for
the Haeundae Golden Beach, right?
If that's approved,
we're not going to just watch.
You should ask
the construction division about that.
Don't worry.
The ward head swore on his position.
And you believe that?
Choi Eok-jo's not a pushover.
I told you not to talk about that guy!
Bottle's empty.
Yeon-hee, bring some more drinks.
That's all there is.
Again? You need to run your business right.
- Keep some in stock.
- Shut up, you jerk!
I'll buy some and be back in a flash!
No, no, you stay here.
I'll go and borrow some.
Sit, sit.
Sit down, man!
Hey, isn't it about time
you two lived together?
It's easy to see, so stop denying it.
When her father died,
he left her under your care.
- Knock it off!
- Stop talking and just drink.
Why?
How could you say that
to someone who has a wife?
What do you mean, "wife"? Shit!
It was just a one night stand.
She doesn't deserve it.
Even so, she gave him Seung-hyun!
So what? Right after his birth,
she ran off with his money.
Hey! I told you to stop!
Every time someone talks about his wife,
he gets defensive.
To be frank, your wife...
I said shut up!
Sit down.
What kind of grades does your son get?
Sit down, man!
My son's a moron, your son's a genius,
you must be fucking proud.
Why are you being like this?
Stop acting weird!
You're having a grand old time here.
You! Give me back the plates
that you borrowed. I need them too.
I'll return them
as soon as these gentlemen leave.
What are you talking about?
Our place is full of customers.
I need them now!
You've got to have a sense of dignity
before doing business.
Mom, please. The chief is here.
She said she'll return them
as soon as we're done.
Crazy fool! Shut your mouth!
Got no place that'll serve you,
so you've crawled here?
Okay, I got it. Let's go.
Chief, let's move to the restaurant up there.
- I'm all right.
- Are you happy now?
Yeah, I am. You jerk!
- Sorry about that.
- It's too much.
What's wrong with you today?
Don't hold it all in,
just tell me what's going on.
I'll fix everything for you.
Is it because you're lonely at night?
What do you think of Man-sik?
Man-sik?
- Choi Man-sik?
- Yes.
- He's terrible.
- Why?
He leaves a bad impression.
And on top of that, his eyes slant.
And your eyes are that great?
Enough.
When he was younger,
he was really handsome.
Handsome? Can you see out of those eyes?
Are you insane?
Why do I have to come with you?
You've been eating on the house.
Now it's time to pay the price!
- Is this why you fed me?
- I told you I'm paying.
- Paying what? 10,000 won?
- Do you think money just grows on trees?
You're really out of your mind, aren't you?
Stop messing around. We're leaving.
Christ!
Yeon-hee!
Yeah?
Wanna go see
a baseball game later?
- Baseball?
- Right, the Giants game.
I'm going with
people from
the commerce association.
You can join
and get to know everyone.
No, I'm fine.
- I'll go! What time is it?
- You just shut up.
How fortunate to get
to see a baseball game.
Yeon-hee! Come with me!
He's lost it.
Please! Yeon-hee!
Jerk!
Come on! You came here to get drunk?
You're supposed to drink
in these kinds of places.
You want some?
No!
- You son of a bitch!
- Are you insane?
Lee Dae-jho hits the ba//,
Park catches it reaching first base.
He's out. Doub/e p/ay out again.
What the hell?
Is it that hard to hit like this?
This is how many today?
What happened to your lips?
This?
- It's nothing.
- Well, it can't be nothing...
Give it to me straight.
Who's this crazy girl
who sucked on your face?
You're not gonna tell us?
I'm not crazy, all right?
Throw to first base! He's out.
/t's the third time Lee Dae-jho is
caught out in a doub/e p/ay.
Consider yourself lucky
I came in person
and not sued you instead.
You understand?
What do you mean?
Did you think
you could get away with this?
You see this?
Don't you think you should
feel responsible for my eye?
How are you going to compensate me?
Compensation?
- How much you get per life?
- What?
Don't they pay you by the person?
We get a salary.
Then how much do you make per month?
About a million won.
Just one million?
- Yeah.
- That's how much they pay
- for you to save people's lives?
- Well, I can't say...
/ am the prince of the sea
Excuse me.
Yes, this is Choi Hyung-sik.
Yes, sir, I will return to base immediately.
Hello.
Your employee won't be leaving
because he's made some commotion.
How the hell do you train these guys?
Jesus, you are not allowed to... Hello?
Wow, it's breathtaking!
What did you say the name of this place is?
I-gi-dae!
I-gi-dae? Is that someone's name?
It's an interesting name.
It's not a person's name.
Two geishas embraced an enemy general
and threw themselves
into the water below with him.
- That's why.
- So?
"L" means "two" and "gi" means "geisha"!
So?
"L" is "two", "gi" is "geisha"! Two geishas.
Is it that hard to understand?
- Yes?
- JWhere are you?
Who are you with?
Me? With the Prince of the Sea!
You mean the comedian Park Myung-jsoo?
- J/s he in Busan now?
- Idiot.
Hey, Joon-ha is pissed off.
He won't hang out with us.
Get your ass over here, now!
No! I'm going to stay here
and go back tomorrow.
What?
Does the idea of sleeping with me
make your heart race?
You're ridiculous.
Don't get carried away!
I'm gonna go back later!
I know. I thought so.
Your face turned red.
It's because I'm drinking. It happens.
You know what? You're very good-looking.
But when you open your mouth,
your accent ruins everything.
Actually,
I can speak without an "assent".
It's not "assent".
It's "accent", got it?
Do you usually suck at talking?
Don't worry!
He'll get out soon.
Thank you so much!
I'm sorry to bother you with this.
It's no problem.
We've all got to look out for each other.
Dae-ho's coming to see me!
Man-sik?
You idiot!
- Mom!
- I'm not your mom any more.
You'll be the death of me, boy!
Do I still have to wipe your ass too!
Don't talk like that in front of my friends.
If you like baseball that much,
shut down the restaurant!
Starting tomorrow, just play ball then!
Mom, you don't know a thing.
We're Busan citizens, aren't we?
A Giants victory should be
more important than our lives.
Don't you know how to bow to your uncle?
Anyway, he's one major human fuck-up.
If I had a gun,
I'd have shot him on the spot.
Hey, get me some food.
Go to your own house and eat!
What am I, your wife?
Where am I gonna go eat?
From now on, don't borrow from anyone.
And if you lend these out to someone else,
I'll be pissed.
It's definitely blocked by something.
Don't think it'll work.
Use my hands?
Hello?
Hello?
How are preparations
for the event coming along?
I'm not sure we'll be able
to even do the event right.
It's that bad?
Now it's going down just fine.
What kind of luxury hotel
has clogged up drains?
Thanks, anyway.
What? Is there a problem?
It's just that...
The hotel isn't paying you?
Usually I get my travel cost covered
on a late call.
Hello!
I'm sorry. Never mind!
Unbelievable!
Do you think this'll take
the water pressure?
This measuring unit could have given
early warning of the tsunami five years ago.
- Are you ready?
- Yes.
The only thing we can do is
counter-calculate Japan's figures
and just take a wild guess.
If we wait for the Japanese to act,
it's going to be too late.
I agree.
But do you think it'll work?
Stop slacking, don't you want
to beat the Japanese to it?
Stop crying
and answer the questions, okay?
You sit down, boy!
I came with my mom and her friend.
Mom's friend? What about your dad?
No, but I know Mom's phone number.
We plan to restrict access
and have teatime here.
Coming out into a space like this
will leave an impression.
- Excuse me.
- When seeing this side...
Yes. This is she.
What?
Incoming call: Yoo-jin
Professor.
We're getting continuous reports
of radon gas leaks!
What?
Hello?
Ji-min!
Are you Ji-min's guardian?
Yes.
She said that she didn't have a father.
Her mom told me she'd be late
and asked me to come.
Would you mind waiting here
for a moment?
We can only hand her over
to the official guardian.
I see.
What's this?
Use that to help you move your business.
That's all right. No use trying this on me.
People died on the Eok-jjo,
the families are all our members.
No matter how much you offer,
they'll never leave their stores.
Don't waste your energy.
Was it all my fault?
You forced the ship out of the port
knowing a typhoon was coming.
The bodies weren't even found.
What? Does it sting a little?
Don't contact me again!
Do you think you know
all there is to know about the world?
Don't be fooled.
The only reason I'm not forcing
anyone out is you and Yeon-hee.
Go ahead and force us out then.
You can't come in here.
- Please leave!
- Let me just sell one.
Did you have anything to eat?
What do you want me to get for you?
Excuse me!
What can I offer you?
Give us a kimbap and a doughnut.
- All right.
- How much is that?
4,000 won.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much!
- Have a nice day.
Thank you, officer!
- Ji-min!
- Mommy!
- What happened? You okay?
- I got lost.
I told you to stay right next to Hae-chan!
Why you gotta go get lost
and make me sick with worry?
Hey, this is your doing!
You don't get to cry.
Can't you see Mommy's busy working?
Listen carefully!
I don't care who you meet or who you date,
but if something happens to her,
I'm not gonna sit and watch.
Now you're the father of the year,
after all those years of not caring?
- What?
- Don't worry about it!
We won't be meeting
under these circumstances ever again.
I've got to leave.
Let's go.
Thank you.
If you were relocated,
you should have at least told me that!
I spent my whole day looking for you!
What are you doing? Come out!
That's not going to be easy.
We know each other too well.
I'm asking you to do it
because it isn't going to be easy.
You just have to persuade Man-sik.
Don't worry about Man-sik.
I can handle him.
All right, then
I won't say anything any more.
If you handle this well,
I'll make sure you get your own store.
You're looking really pretty today.
It took you long enough!
It's about time you got married.
Why don't you introduce me
to a good man first?
Really?
Should I find a guy for you?
Enough of that!
I'm serious.
You know the chairman
of the fishing village, Jin-seung?
He has a good education
and his personality seems pretty good.
Wanna give him a try?
- Are you serious?
- Huh?
Are you being serious?
No, I mean...
That's upsetting.
Hey, bro!
It's been a long time!
It's time for you to clean up your act.
You're getting old, aren't you worried?
I'm actually planning
to start up my own business.
That's why I'm here,
to ask Man-sik for some help.
By the way,
your father's memorial date is
coming close, right?
You even remember
the date of my father's memorial?
That's really touching.
It's no big deal.
I was at his side when he died,
of course I remember the date.
Thanks to Man-sik,
we were on that fishing boat that day.
Bugger off!
What brought you to Haeundae?
My name's not "you".
It's Kim Hi-mi!
And why do you ask
such cliché questions?
I came to have a good time.
You said that you go
to Ewha Women's University, right?
- That's right.
- So, your major is...
I'm going to be in the theatre programme.
I mean, I'm in the programme.
Then you must be good at acting.
I'm not that great.
You wanna see?
No, that's all right.
You son of a bitch!
It's no use trying to persuade me!
Is love just a game to you?
You did everything to win me over
and you're ending it?
Are you human?
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm never giving up our baby!
No, I can't!
I will keep it!
I'll raise it on my own.
If you're going to go, just go!
Get lost!
My baby...
No, it's not what it looks like.
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Please, don't!
Let me have some.
You're a big girl now!
Drinking booze and everything.
Do you still see me as a child?
If not, then what?
See, that's why it won't work.
What?
Do you remember?
What?
When you came to see Dad
on your first deep-sea vessel ride.
Of course I remember!
I was a freshman in high school then.
Was it that long ago?
You didn't see me before you left, right?
Were you home then?
- Yeah.
- Really?
But I was too shy to come out of my room.
- Why?
- I don't know.
I guess I was going through puberty.
Whenever I saw you,
my heart would beat so fast.
Your heart?
What are you up to tomorrow?
Tomorrow? Why?
Would you like to come with me
to my dad's grave site?
I need to trim the grass around it
before the memorial ritual.
Sure. I'll go with you.
Fix the cage, right now!
Man-sik! You have to grab this one first!
This is the one that we have to fix first!
If you undo that one,
the anchor will break!
On land, you're the elder.
But out here, I'm your boss.
Just do as I say!
Don't you see that?
You've got to release this right now.
Why do you keep talking?
Just do what I say!
What are you doing?
Aren't you gonna help?
Don't go there!
We don't have time! Hurry up!
Don't pull that!
Daddy, I'm scared.
It's all right.
It's all right.
You're still mad at me? Christ!
That's an interesting watch.
- Can I have it?
- What?
Wanna switch with me?
Mine is a really expensive one.
No way. I really need this on rescue.
All right, I don't want it.
Do you know what they call
people like you?
No, what?
- You're just like three o'clock!
- What?
You're very borderline.
Just like three in the afternoon.
Too late to go anywhere
but a waste not to do anything.
What do you mean?
What?
Wait! Don't! Don't! Let go of me!
Just stay there like that!
Oh, my God! Crazy bitch!
- I'm so embarrassed.
- The "off to Seoul" Hi-mi is here in Busan.
Maybe her identical twin?
Slow it down!
The figures are too similar to 2004
for it to be just a coincidence.
In 2004, the epicentre continued
to move to the right just like this.
Starting six months before the tsunami,
we measured instances of earthquakes
at a depth of 30 km on the sea floor.
How many earthquakes has it been
so far this year?
More than 50.
Before the Southeast Asia tsunami,
it was over 50 as well.
What's the median severity?
3.0.
There's been another
earthquake on the sea floor!
- Where?
- East of Tsushima Island!
- What's the magnitude?
- 5.6.
They're getting bigger.
Sir.
This is a serious situation.
This is really serious.
Look.
There's a million gathered
at Haeundae right now.
If a tsunami hits
under such circumstances...
Are there any chances
of a tsunami hitting Korea?
I have never heard about
something like that.
How many earthquakes you think
occur around Korea per year?
About three or four?
30 of more than 3.0 in intensity.
So far this year, we've already had 50.
And what's more important is the
epicentre's moving closer to Korea.
If Tsushima Island,
between Korea and Japan, collapses,
the chances of a mega-tsunami
are extremely high.
A mega-tsunami?
Let's say that the bubbles are
about the size of a wave that would arise
in the event of an earthquake.
If the western part of Tsushima
sinks into the water,
the shock from that would create
a wave of an unimaginable height.
That is a mega-tsunami.
The waves of the 2004 tsunami
were three to four metres.
If Tsushima Island collapses,
the waves will top 50 metres.
Is that a real possibility?
I'm talking about a minimum of 50 metres.
A wave over 100 metres is possible.
Then what is it we've got to do to prepare?
If the tsunami warning goes off,
we've got to evacuate people
within ten minutes.
Within that amount of time?
A tsunami causes a tidal wave
that travels 700 km per hour.
700 km?
If a tsunami starts at Tsushima,
- to get to Haeundae it would take...
- How long?
Less than ten minutes!
Did you fight with my father?
What are you doing there?
- Get over here.
- All right.
Father,
I brought your favourite,
Man-sik, here with me.
I wanted to tell you
something very important today,
so I brought him.
He's taken care of me so well.
Now I wanna return the favour.
Sometimes,
he even takes care of me
better than you did.
Well,
I keep dropping hints but
that dullard never gets it.
So I've been a little frustrated lately.
But I can't just bare my heart to him first.
I don't wanna lose face.
So you coach that man over there.
You were always popular with the ladies.
Hey, you listen to what
my father tells you, all right?
I'll be back in a sec.
How are you holding up?
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
What do you mean?
What if
in the future,
Yeon-hee became my wife?
How would you feel?
How much did you drink?
Show some respect.
Are you serious?
Listen carefully. If there's a girl from Seoul
who goes to a good university
and is so hot
and from a rich family,
could I go out with a girl like that?
That make any sense?
It does not.
Right? It doesn't, does it?
Don't drink too much.
Think about it carefully.
What Yeon-hee's father's
last words were.
Run to the restaurant in 10 minutes,
or you'll be dead and so will I.
Can I be out for
about an hour?
Where are you going this time?
I have an important appointment.
Choi Hyung-sik?
The fireworks display
of the World Culture Expo.
You're a natural.
How many girls did you get with that act?
But I cannot forgive you
for flirting with my fiancé.
What?
You should know who she's with
before you flirt with her.
She's not the kind of girl within your reach.
You're a real classy guy.
I hope this is the last time that I see you.
If I catch you again,
I'll beat the shit out of you.
You look as if something good
has just happened to you.
Yep, that's right.
What happened?
Today finally,
Mipo Golden Beach has been approved.
But you don't need to worry about it.
I promised your dad I'd take care of you.
Drop by my office tomorrow,
I'll set you up with a good spot.
No, that's all right.
You've already helped me out a lot.
You leaving now?
Do you want me to call a taxi?
No, no. I'm fine.
Eok-jo!
I will send the rent fee for the boat
in a few days.
I don't spare money when it comes to you,
so don't work too hard for money.
All right. Goodbye.
Why did that old man come here?
Just to have dinner.
Don't serve him next time.
He pisses me off.
- What brings you so late?
- Oh, right!
What's the special occasion?
Wait a second.
Yeon-hee!
I love you!
I want you to be the mother of my children!
What are you doing?
I'm proposing.
Why aren't you answering?
- Answer what?
- Say you will marry me.
Let me think about it...
Think about what?
You have to give me time to think.
If it's a yes, it's a yes.
What's there to think about?
Early tomorrow morning,
come to my restaurant.
If there is a red ribbon tied
to my boat, it's a yes.
- Don't expect too much, though.
- Why don't you just give me an answer?
Come, look!
Are you playing with me?
I have been waiting for you all day.
If you can't keep promises,
you shouldn't make them.
And if you can't keep a promise,
you should at least explain why.
Hey. Are you going to keep ignoring me?
Hey, you!
Hey!
Don't fool around with me.
Don't come to see me.
I don't want to see you again.
What?
What?
Interview?
It's a small company,
but the salary's almost two million won.
I had a really hard time getting
someone I know to arrange it.
Stop it. How can I be doing
job interviews at my age?
Are you going to live
without a job for your entire life?
Who said I would be jobless
for the rest of my life?
Stubborn jackass!
Anyway, I won't go.
Don't try to persuade me.
I'm begging you.
I don't even have
an acceptable pair of shoes.
Will you go if I buy you shoes?
Just forget about it!
Why is it so hard for you
to go to a job interview?
Go and try, at least.
Why don't you go?
I'm too old for that.
That attitude is the reason
you don't have a woman.
Shit. I'll burn your mouth.
Moron, you say that all the time.
My skin doesn't look right.
Are you insane?
Why are you in such a good mood?
Why? Do you want to know?
No way!
Do you want me to tell you?
I didn't say I want to know.
In fact...
Today, Man-sik proposed to me!
- What?
- Isn't it funny?
I was so shocked.
I'm embarrassed.
Why? Do you feel jealous?
- This just isn't right.
- What do you mean?
What's he thinking?
What are you saying?
Do you know how your dad passed away?
We've got major problems here.
The path of the typhoon
has already shifted toward us,
and underwater earthquakes are
occurring once every two days.
Another earthquake happened
off the shore of Tsushima Island!
This time, it's 6.5.
Doctor! We are connected to Japan!
This is Kim Hwi.
What? Has a tsunami warning
already been issued?
Under sea near Tsushima Island
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
You must be waiting for Yeon-hee,
but she won't be coming.
What?
Thanks to you, Eok-jo cussed me out.
You act like you don't care
about justice at all,
so I told her the truth!
Since I was a kid,
my nickname was the guardian of justice.
You son of a bitch!
You get here!
You scumbag!
You killed her dad. Isn't it true?
Take your hand off!
What?
Has he gone crazy?
Wait up. I'm coming right now.
What are you talking about? How can
we evacuate one million people right now?
On top of that,
the Culture Expo opened today.
If we put a halt to it,
we'll be the world's laughingstock!
Do you want all the people here to die?
In Japan, the cautionary warning
has already been issued.
In Japan, earthquakes happen a lot.
Do you have proof a tsunami
will be coming here?
Last night's 6.5 earthquake
occurred near Tsushima Island.
There is a high chance
a stronger earthquake will hit soon.
Moreover, if an earthquake over 7.0
occurs off the shore of Tsushima,
Haeundae will be in grave danger.
Didn't you see what happened
in Southeast Asia? 300,000 died in an hour!
You're driving me crazy.
Why are you doing this to me?
Do you want to ruin my life?
I never wanted to interrupt your work!
I just told them because it is
a terribly dangerous situation.
For the last year,
I've been risking my career over this!
You think you are the only one
who is working? I do too!
Even if you try to get in my way,
I will continue.
I'm not ignoring you,
so just calm down.
Why don't you send Ji-min to Seoul first.
Don't boss me around.
I'll handle Ji-min on my own.
She's with that strange jerk, isn't she?
Watch your mouth.
He is more reliable than you'll ever be!
Stay out of my life, all right?
