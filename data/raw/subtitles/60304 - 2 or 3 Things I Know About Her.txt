2 OR 3 THINGS I KNOW ABOUT HER
HER: THE PARIS REGION
On August 19th an act was published...
...concerning the governmental
organization of the Paris region
Two days later, Paul Delouvrier...
...was appointed Prefect
of the Paris region...
...which, according to the
official communiqué...
...now became a new and distinct
administrative unit
Her: She is Marina Vlady, an actress
She is wearing a midnight blue
sweater with two yellow stripes
She is of Russian origin
Her hair is dark auburn
or light brown, I'm not sure
Yes, speak as though quoting the truth
Old father Brecht said that...
...that actors should quote
Now she is turning her head to the
right, but that's not important
Her: She is Juliette Janson,
who lives here
She is wearing a midnight blue
sweater with two yellow stripes
Her hair is dark auburn
or light brown, I'm not sure
She is of Russian origin
Two years ago in Martinique...
just like a Simenon novel
I don't know which one...
oh, yes, Banana Tourists
I've got to manage somehow
I think Robert earns 1,100 francs
a month
Now she has turned her head to the
left, but that's not important
I conclude that the Gaullist
government...
...under a mask of modernization
and reform...
...is merely regularizing the
natural tendencies of capitalism
Also that, in systemizing planning
and centralization...
...the government is further
disrupting the nation's economy...
...not to mention its
basic moral fibre
18 LESSONS ON INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY
I'm just looking at the floor,
that's all
I can feel the tablecloth
- It's fantastic!
- What can you hear?
The Saigon-Washington circuit
- Who's talking?
- Johnson
Johnson? What's he saying?
In 1965, to force Hanoi to negotiate...
...it was with a heavy heart
that I ordered...
...my pilots to bomb North Vietnam
It was tremendous...
...but Hanoi would not negotiate
In 1966, again with a heavy heart...
...I ordered my pilots to bomb
Haiphong and Hanoi
Let me listen
It was tremendous, but Hanoi
would not negotiate
In July, 1967, still with
a heavy heart...
...I ordered my pilots to destroy
Chinese nuclear bases
It was tremendous, but Hanoi
would not negotiate
In 1967, to force Hanoi to negotiate...
...and still with a heavy heart...
...I ordered my pilots to bomb Peking
It was tremendous, but Hanoi
would not negotiate
Now, my missiles are aimed at Moscow
President Johnson says that Hanoi
must understand...
...his patience has limits
Damn, I can't hear now
Would you like me to wear tights
designed to look like knee-socks?
They make daring dresses decent...
and flatter young, slender legs
Stop talking rubbish
- "Madame Express" says so
- Never heard of her
You're so unsophisticated
Now it's the American generals
They say they want to send the
Vietnamese back to the Stone Age
"Stone" means the same as pierre,
doesn't it?
How did you pay for your Mini?
Juliette found it; she has
a real nose for bargains
Dear George Washington, what
madness made you a William Pitt?
Pax Americana: Jumbo-sized
brain-washing
A sort of "message from beyond" thing
I was doing the dishes
I started to cry
I heard a voice saying:
"You are indestructible"
I, me, myself, everybody
I don't know really...
it's so confused
I don't really know what time is
It may not be definable
Roger is leaving
We often try to analyse
the meaning of words...
...but are too easily led astray
One must admit that
there's nothing simpler...
...than taking things for granted
Undoubtedly, the planning of
the Paris region...
...will favour the government's
policy of class discrimination...
...and allow the monopolies
to shape the economy...
...without reference to the needs
of its eight million inhabitants
The eyes are the body...
...and sound is...
Do you ever dream, mummy?
- You'll be late for school
- But I want to know
In my dreams I used to feel that I
was being sucked into a huge hole
Now I feel I'm being scattered
in a thousand pieces
Before, even if it was a slow process,
I would wake up all at once
Now I'm afraid there'll be
pieces missing
I had a dream last night, you know
I was walking all alone
at the edge of a cliff
The path was only wide enough
for one person
Suddenly, I saw two twins
walking towards me
I wondered how they would get past
Suddenly, one of the twins
went towards the other...
...and they became one person
And then I realized that
these two people...
...were North and South Vietnam
being united
What is language, mummy?
Language is the house man lives in

INDUSTRIAL SOCIETIES
Electricity, Madame.
Where is the meter?
I'm afraid it's fifty francs
Enjoying facilities they
never had before...
...people use gas and hot water,
without thinking of the bill to come
This means money for the rent...
...or else doing without TV,
a car, or holidays
A change from their usual standards,
in other words
Only seven more minutes
I've brought you Solange,
Monsieur Gérard
Aren't you forgetting something?
This is all I have, but
I'll do better next week
Only three more minutes
Can we come in?
I'm a bit short
Go over there with the other children
Come and play. Let's read a story
Picky Pouc is walking by a river
There, hatching her eggs...
...Madame Pelican...
Always the same story:
She trains as a dressmaker
and is hired by a small firm
She meets a boy, gets pregnant,
he leaves her
Next year, another guy, same thing
At the maternity home
she gets sermons...
...but also useful tips
on how to support two kids
So she does her job by day,
and becomes a prostitute at night
One day a nice guy falls in love
with her and marries her
They set up house
Too expensive, of course.
A third kid arrives
And the husband asks her
to go on the streets
Is it cotton?
Have you dresses like this?
I finish at seven; I'm meeting
Jean-Claude at eight
We'll eat, then go to the pictures
Yes, I know how to talk
Let's talk together
Together is a word I like
Together means thousands of people,
perhaps a whole city
No one knows what the city
of the future will be like
Part of the wealth of meaning it once
had will undoubtedly be lost
Undoubtedly
Maybe
The creative and formative roles
of the city...
...will be taken over by other forms
of communication
Maybe... television and radio...
Vocabulary and syntax,
consciously and deliberately
No lunch yet and it's three
Navy-blue Shetland sweaters
A new language is needed
I got up at eight o'clock.
I have hazel eyes
PYSCHOLOGY OF FORMS
May I try this on?
In this room there is some blue,
red and green
Yes, I'm quite sure
My sweater is blue
White should suit you
I'd like a cotton dress with sleeves
Because I can see it's blue
But what if blue had been called
green by mistake?
This is fine, but...
When do you close?
- Seven
- Keep it for me
I can't do that. You'll have to
see the...
Will you put this aside
while I go to the bank?
- Very well, but only until six
- I'll be back before six
That's why my feelings haven't always
a specific object
Desire, for instance
Sometimes you know the object
of your desire, sometimes not
For instance, I feel I'm missing
something, but don't know what...
...or else I feel afraid
with nothing to fear
Does any expression...
...not refer to a specific object?
Oh, yes... order, logic
For instance, something may
make me cry, but...
...the reason for my tears
is not contained...
...in their traces on my cheeks
In other words...
...you can describe what happens
when I do something...
...without necessarily indicating...
...what makes me do it
I'll be back at six
I examine the city, its inhabitants,
and the bonds between them...
...as closely as a biologist
examines...
...the relations between individual
and race in evolution
Only thus can I tackle problems
of social pathology...
...and formulate the hope for
a genuine new city
To define myself, one word:
Indifference
How are you?
I arrived this morning.
I'm waiting for Jean-Paul
I'm staying until this evening
I see you have new shoes
I live in the big block
near the Autoroute du Sud
I come to Paris twice a month
You know: The big blue and white
buildings
- They're American shoes
- To trample Vietnamese with
To trample South Americans, too
We've met i think. Consider
my offer, I only take 10%
You don't say
- Heard about Isabelle?
- Yes, a razor-slashing
You're not scared?
The war's over, and anyway I'm only
doing this temporarily... I hope
This is how Juliette, at 3.37 p.m.,
watched the turning pages...
...of that object known in
journalese as a magazine
And this is how, 150 frames later,
another young woman, her twin...
...saw the same object.
Where, then, is the truth?
Full-face or profile?
But first, what is an object?
Perhaps it is a link enabling us...
...to pass from one subject to
another, therefore to live together
But since social relations
are always ambiguous...
...since thought divides
as much as it unites...
...since words unite or isolate
by what they express or omit...
...since an immense gulf separates
my subjective awareness...
...from the objective truth
I represent for others...
...since I constantly blame myself,
though I feel innocent...
...since every event transforms
my daily life...
...since I constantly fail
to communicate...
...since each failure makes me
aware of solitude...
...since...
...since I cannot escape crushing
objectivity or isolating subjectivity...
...since I cannot rise to the state
of being, or fall into nothingness...
...I must listen, I must look around
more than ever
The world... my kin... my twin
The world alone...
...today when revolutions are
impossible and wars threaten me...
...when capitalism is unsure of its
rights and the working class retreats...
...when the lightning progress
of science...
...brings the future terribly near...
...when the future is closer
than the present...
...when the distant galaxies
are at my door...
...my kin, my twin...
Where is the beginning?
But what beginning?
God created heaven and earth. But
one should be able to put it better
To say that the limits of language,
of my language...
...are those of the world,
of my world...
...and that in speaking,
I limit the world, I end it
And when mysterious, logical death
abolishes these limits...
...there will be no question,
no answer, just vagueness
But if things come into focus again...
...this can only be through
the rebirth of conscience
Everything follows from this
I don't know where or when...
...just that it happened
I have tried all day
to recapture the feeling
There was a scent of trees
I was the world...
the world was me
A landscape is like a face
This is for Jews only...
because it's a one-star hotel
I don't want you to watch me
undressing
- You'll be naked anyway
- That's different
I'm a Parisian
I work in the Métro
There are two million other
Parisians down there, too
You never see them, because
the police don't allow photographs
Mind if the mirror's there?
I can't help it if I tend to be passive
Having sexual intercourse...
Why should I be ashamed of
being a woman?
If I am, it's of being happy
or indifferent
Yes, that's what I'm ashamed of
sometimes
He's going to put himself
between my legs
I feel the weight of my arm
when I move it
Perhaps I should leave Robert
He doesn't want to get ahead in
the world, he's content as he is
It was the same in Martinique
- Why the lipstick?
- What's it to you?
- How do you want it?
- I don't know
- Italian-style?
- What's that?
You stand and I kneel,
so you can see me
The idea of being sexually
independent of a man is tempting...
...but in practice I'd hate it
Humility isn't really a good thing...
...because it's sad
I'd say the same about shame...
...as a way of stopping people
quarrelling
Because shame determines
everyone's actions...
...on the basis of other people's
approval or censure
So it's sad, too
Therefore it's bad...
...like self-contempt...
...and all such feelings
- Want it this way?
- Certainly not
I was offered...
...thirty francs a day to work
in the Madeleine area
Do you understand?
I'm a secretary
I speak English and Italian
But no job because I'm too old
No, nothing for you, they said
at the agency yesterday
What is art?
Form becoming style;
but the style is the man...
...therefore art is the humanizing
of forms...
I look at the wall, at objects
Now... Never... There
At the moment I'm looking out
What a tan! Where have you been?
In Russia
- Where?
- Silence. In Leningrad
Are the Russians nice?
Happiness. They're like anyone else
- I was just asking
- They're pleasant enough
A few sounds
Seen the Duperrets lately?
I saw them briefly near
the Gare St. -Lazare
It's true, though, that people
never know each other...
It's broken
Blue exercise books
How goes it?
Not to have to make love
It's better than the factory
I wouldn't like to work in a factory
How are the children?
Words never say what
I'm really saying
They're fine, but not too
well behaved
I wait...
I watch...
This one?
My hair
The telephone
It's for you, Marianne
- Isn't Yvonne here?
- No, she's sick
Can I leave half an hour early again?
If Paulette agrees
I'm very careful crossing the road
I think of the accident
before it can happen
...putting an end to my life...
Unemployment...
...sickness... old age...
Death... never
I've no plans for the future,
all prospects are closed
My name is Paulette Cadjaris
I didn't make the grade as a typist
No, I don't believe in the future
I wander around, I don't like
being shut in
I do a bit of reading when I can
Yes, I like to study people's
characters
I like walking and climbing...
...and going cycling, just for fun
Movies? Two or three times a month,
but not in summer
I've never been to the theatre,
though I'd like to
I prefer reading... biographies...
...studying people's lives,
their character...
...their work...
...books on travel...
...ancient history
A tree
Later, when François and I
are married...
What else have I done?
Just ordinary things
There is increasing interaction
between images and language
One might say that living
in society today...
...is almost like living in
a vast comic strip
Yet language in itself cannot
accurately define an image
For instance...
For instance, how do you
render events?
How to say or show that at 4.10 p.m.
That afternoon...
...Juliette and Marianne came to the
garage where Juliette's husband works?
Right way, wrong way...
...how can one say exactly
what happened?
Of course, there is Juliette,
her husband, the garage
But are these the words and images
to use? Are there no others?
Am I talking too loud,
looking too close?
For instance, there are leaves...
...and although Juliette is
no Faulkner heroine...
...those leaves are as dramatically
valid as the wild palms
There's another girl...
- even that
one can't say completely honestly
There's also a cloudy sky,
if I turn my head...
...and words on the walls
Why all these signs which
make me doubt language...
...by drowning reality rather than
detaching it from the imaginary?
In images, anything goes:
The best and the worst
Before my eyes, common sense repairs
the break in my reasoning
Objects exist...
...and if we pay them more attention
than we do people...
...it is because they exist more
than those people
Dead objects live on
Living people are often dead already
I'm looking for reasons to live
happily
And if I now push this analysis
further...
...I think there is a reason for
living simply in memory...
...and in the facility for
stopping to enjoy the present...
...that is, to catch a fleeting
reason to be alive...
...and to have kept it
a few seconds...
...and after it has been unearthed
from the circumstances surrounding it
To bring into the world of man
the simplest things...
...to see the human spirit
take possession of them...
...to create a new world where man
and things exist in harmony...
...that is my aim
As much political as poetic, it
explains this passion for expression
Whose passion? Mine:
Writer and painter
It is 4.45 p.m.
Should I have talked about Juliette
or the leaves...
...since it's impossible
to do both at once?
Let's say that both, on this
October evening, trembled slightly
THE GREAT HOPE OF THE 20TH CENTURY
- Been here long?
- Three years
- Where are you from?
- Algeria
You like it better here?

- One of each
- And your parents?
- They're back home
What's your father's job?
He's in aviation
- Your mother?
- She doesn't work

of three civilizations
The era of leisure, the era of
the key-ring...
...and the era of the bum

I thought it was 150 francs

150 francs for the whole night?
You're crazy
He's not here
I don't know why, but I was
thinking about things
It's a big place, isn't it?
There's even a bathroom
Thought meshes with reality
or calls it in question
Calls it in question
Where's this guy, then?
- What's he saying?
- We undress here
I'll wear it after. It's from Chez Vog
Have you seen Paco Rabannes' dresses?
They're super, all made of
little metal discs
They're terrific; for evenings,
of course
I could speak French
They're all crazy down there
A dead Vietcong costs the
U.S. Treasury a million dollars
Johnson could get 20,000 girls
like you for that
I existed, that's all I knew
That's all I could tell
Your tee shirt is very
America uber alles
Yes, cities are constructions
in space
The mobile elements of a city?
I don't know
The inhabitants...
Yes, the mobile elements are
as important as the fixed ones
Even at its most commonplace,
a city is a pleasant spectacle
No event has an autonomous life
It's always limited to things
around it
Perhaps the observer of
this spectacle...
...is simply me?
Each inhabitant has ties with
certain parts of the city
And with what?
With the image, usually steeped
in associations
The physical clarity of this image
Paris is a mysterious city...
...asphyxiating... natural
What's going on? He's crazy
He enjoys it better if we don't look
No, not that
Never mind, I'll do it
It's strange that a person...
...in Europe on 17th August, 1966...
...can be thinking of a person
in Asia
Thinking, meaning to say...
...are not activities like
writing, running or eating
They're inside you
If someone asks me to go on
with this song...
...I could, yes, I could go on
What sort of process is this...
...this knowing one can go on
with something?
I don't know
For example, I can think of
someone absent...
...imagine him...
...or find him evoked by a remark...
...even if he is dead
For example, I say:
"I'm hot"...
...or rather, "I'm impatient"
Now I understand the thought process
It's substituting...
...an effort of the imagination for
an examination of real objects
To say something, to try to
say something...
Perhaps they are manifestations of
the nervous and muscular systems
For example, I say:
"I'm going to meet Robert
at the Elysée-Marbeuf"
Now I try to think it without words...
...neither out loud
nor under my breath
- Waiting for someone?
- Yes, my wife
I'm waiting, too, but he may not come
- A note for her?
- No, it's for myself
Too bad, it's raining

...as though Miss Calendar
could open doors for her
- You've nothing else to say to me?
- No, nothing special
How about you?
Want me to tell you what I'm doing?
You just did, you're writing
But it's very special. I pick up
messages from the beyond
I saw a film where someone did that
Tell me again what you said
about the rain
I like rain
You didn't say that
No, I didn't
I said rain made me sad
Isn't that rather commonplace?
No, because rain doesn't make
everyone sad
Tell me something else
you find interesting
People never really talk in films.
I'd like to try with you
You want to talk with me really?
Only because you're a stranger
I like talking to strangers
Well, talk then
- Do you know what it means to talk?
- It's saying words
And what is saying words?
Saying words... is talking...
...to say stupid things
or interesting things
How could we talk together?
Really talk, committing ourselves
totally
Well, by picking an interesting
subject and discussing it
- All right, let's talk about sex
- As usual
Are you afraid to?
I think you're afraid
Think what you like, but I'm not.
Why should I be?
Why are people always scared of sex?
It doesn't scare me
Well, I'm going to ask you to say
something, and I bet you refuse
Go ahead
Promise you'll say it
It depends whether it's silly
and whether I want to or not
- See? You're scared
- It's not that at all
All right, I'll tell you
My sexual organ is between my legs.
Go on, say it
We're not in school
No, but you said you weren't
scared of sex
- I'm not
- Say it, then
Why? It's stupid
It's as simple as lighting
a cigarette
No, I light a cigarette
because I want to smoke
What's the point in saying
something obvious?
You have a sexual organ just as you
have eyes. Why not say so?
Because I don't talk about my eyes,
shoulders or sex, that's why
You should; you have lovely eyes.
A lovely mouth, too
Isn't that man the Nobel Prize winner?
Ivanov? Could be
What will communist ethics be like?
The same as they are now, I expect
Meaning what?
Look out for one another,
work for one's country...
...Love it...
...Love the arts and science
What will the difference be, then?
It will be easier to explain
when communism comes
Oh, yes, I understand, it's money
It's a great evil, because
you steal without realizing it
Can I ask you a question?
- Should one be honest with oneself?
- At your age, definitely
And at yours?
At my age... as often as possible
No, always
You're right
One must always be sensitive to
the intoxication of life
Can I ask you another question?
Is poetry formative,
or simply decorative?
Everything that decorates life
is formative
You mentioned intoxication:
Did you mean beer or vodka?
Neither. Just intoxication
I've never tried either.
What is the intoxication of life?
I think that you know what it is
I often get depressed and I cry.
It's terrible
Haven't you time to talk about me?
Actually, it might be better done
in writing...
...but that would be even worse
than it is now
Please don't look at me, I'm so
ashamed. But only you can advise me
- Why me?
- I don't know
- Why me?
- I don't know
Don't you have friends...
...a tutor, parents?
Yes, I have
Aren't they good people?
Some of them are
Intelligent people?
Yes, intelligent
Then why me?
Have you read my books?
Not really read... but we study them
in school
Don't you think it's strange, then,
that it's me you want to talk to?
I thought you had more courage
It's not a question of courage...
...but of competence
Then we'd better stop
I'll go away
What have you been doing all day,
clever?
This morning I worked... at my garage
- Do you own it?
- No, I don't
Then why is it "my" garage?
At "the" garage. Right
You're not listening
How do you know it's a garage?
Are you sure the word isn't
"swimming-pool" or "hotel"?
I suppose it could be
Exactly. How do things get
particular names?
They're given them
Who by?
You know a lot, but do you know
yourself?
Not very well
Gilbert frowned slightly.
Martine noticed, and blushed
Crowned by dualism, the Hungarian
success was national...
...but the rise of Italy and Germany
was international
Another egg mayonnaise and
a chocolate mousse
Involuntarily, my fingers moved.
"He'll talk", said a voice
The water stopped, the gag was
removed. I could breathe again
In the darkness the two officers
hit my stomach...
...to pump out the water
I'd swallowed
Thought, however, is not merely the
investigation of non-thought
- What for you, Monsieur Pécuchet?
- A surprise
I'm out of surprises
Thought as such is bound to
the coming of Being
Being, inasmuch as it is the coming,
is the end of thought
Being is, inasmuch as it is the end
of thought...
SOCIOLOGY OF THE NOVEL
Hurry up, I haven't all day!
- Why not there?
- There's no room
No need to wait on events now,
to photograph and kill people
Go back to the ABC of existence
Nor when?
I only remember it happened
Maybe it's not important
It was on the way to the hotel
with the chap from the Métro
- I've thought
about it all day
A sense of my ties with the world
Suddenly I felt I was the world...
...and the world was me
I would take pages and pages,
whole volumes, to describe that
A landscape is like a face
I wanted to say, I simply see a face
with a particular expression
But that doesn't mean it's
an extraordinary expression...
...or that you'll try to describe it
Perhaps you want to say it's this
or that
She looks like Chekhov's Natasha
Or she's Nanook's sister
in Flaherty's film
But you'd be right to say
it can't be described in words
Yet I feel the expression on my face
must mean something
Something standing out from
the general outline
I mean from the sort of form
outlined which...
As if it were possible to say...
...this face has a particular
expression... and then...
...and then... in fact,
this is what it is
For instance, weariness
Our apartment in the best part of
town was sold, and we were stuck here
It just isn't the same
What are we to do?
We'll start over again
It's nice here, we have lots of fun
No games, though
The ladders over there
are dangerous
SOLD HERE
They took away the roundabout
and swings
It's nice, if only we had
something to do
Go and find the children.
What about the key?
Hello. What are you doing?
My homework
- What's it about?
- Friendship. I'll read it
In my new school, the boys and girls
are all together
This makes it co-ed
Is friendship between boys and girls
possible? Yes and no
Yes, because some girls are very nice
Maryse, Martine, Ghislaine, Roseline
With these girls we can talk
"Hello kid", I say.
"Hello", they reply
Then we talk until we disagree
"Be quiet", he says.
"Yes, but you said that"
If I agree, we go on talking
In this case friendship is good
because the girls are nice
With Maryse and Roseline we have
more serious discussions
"What is your answer to this problem?",
Roseline asked
"A over B equals AOB..."
Here again friendship is possible
and desirable
No, because the other girls
are mean and sneaky
The ones with glasses we don't talk
to, we quarrel with them
Oh, anything is possible
Can I go on, please?
"You're impossible", she says
I kick her, she throws an ink-ball
at me, teacher comes in
In this case friendship is not
desirable or possible
I'd rather be electrocuted
with my feet in water
Both nice and nasty girls
are quite clean...
...and most are nice,
so I feel better about it
Well, we got there
- Where?
- Home
- So what now?
- We go to bed. What's up with you?
- And then?
- We wake up
- And then?
- Same again
We'll wake up. We'll eat
And then?
I don't know
Die
And then?
Can I read for a bit?
What does it mean to know something?
Robert, fetch Solange, please
Show my eyes...
I know they're my eyes
because I see with them
I know they're not my knees or
whatever, because I've been told so
Suppose I hadn't been told?
How would life be?
If Hitler came, I'd shoot him
How can I be sure?
I'd be waiting for him
As soon as he came in, I'd shoot
No, I don't know where he is
When I don't know, I imagine
How can I imagine, when I don't know
where he is?
No, I don't know if he's still alive
Yes, perhaps I'm confusing thought
and reality
Yes, I'd be inclined to say that...
...since real objects don't always
exist...
...to vouch for the truth...
...the truth of our thoughts
Our thoughts are not the substance
of reality...
...but its shadow
I'm not sure
The children are asleep
To define oneself in a word:
Not yet dead
- 
average practical intelligence...
...involving wide-ranging interests
and the ability to make decisions
Richardson, Buloz and Henry
discovered that...
...among the 2,589 persons
employed by their clients...
...the practical I.Q. Score
for executives was 84...
...for managers and foremen, 78,
and for manual workers, 74
The successful man is self-confident,
but not aggressive
Did you underline that?
The successful man is prepared
to acknowledge his failings
He is not afraid to say "I don't know"
Only a man who is sure of himself
can admit defeat
I don't agree
Read something else
if you don't like it
Do you know the difference between
true and false love?
False love leaves me as I am. Time
changes me and the person I love
Do you think I've changed?
I'm just tired
No, not you. Me
I've changed and I'm still the same.
So, what is it?
I don't know
In that case, give me a cigarette
Listening to the commercials on my
transistor, and thanks to Esso...
...I drive off without a care
on the road to dreams
I forget Hiroshima, Auschwitz,
Budapest...
...I forget Vietnam,
the housing problem...
...the famine in India
I forget everything except that
I'm back at zero...
...and have to start from there
