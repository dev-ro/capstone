YOU'VE GOT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.
THIS IS A SEX CLINIC...
WE DON'T DEAL WITH THE

I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

HEY MAN THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. AND I
WANT-- YOU KNOW, LIKE, UH, THANK YOU.

NO GUTS.
NO SPINE. NO...

SHE SAID SHE
THINKS SHE'S IN LOVE.
SHE REALLY SAID THAT?
- HMM.

I'M HERE
TO SEE MRS. CLOONEY.
AND YOU ARE?

Dr. Zuckerbrot: WHICH BRINGS US
TO TODAY'S SUBJECT --
PREMATURE EJACULATION.
PREMATURE EJACULATION
MEANS ALWAYS HAVING TO SAY
YOU ARE SORRY.
THERE ARE
MANY SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT
ON HOW TO PACE YOURSELF
AND MAINTAIN SELF-CONTROL.
SOME ADVOCATE KEEPING A BUCKET
OF ICE WATER BESIDE THE BED
AND DIPPING YOUR TOES INTO IT
AT THE CRITICAL MOMENT.
OTHERS RECOMMEND
THAT YOU CONCENTRATE
ON SOMETHING PROSAIC.
TRY TO THINK OF THE NAMES
OF THE SEVEN DWARVES
IN "SNOW WHITE."
TRY TO REMEMBER
YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.
EXCUSE ME, COULD YOU TELL ME
WHERE THE LIBRARY --
SORRY, NOT NOW.
MY FIANCéE HAS A SLOW LEAK.

- HI.
- VICTOR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME.
I SAID?
HE SAID THAT YOU SAID IT.

COME ON. PACK YOUR THINGS.
WE'RE GOING TO GO HOME.
YOU'VE HAD YOUR FUN.
FUN? YOU THINK
I'M DOING THIS FOR FUN?
THIS HAS BEEN
THE MOST MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE
OF MY LIFE.
LOOKING AT DIRTY PICTURES?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK IT IS?
THIS IS BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.
COME OFF IT, WILL YOU?
FIRST YOU WERE INTO FERNS,
AND THEN IT WAS WHALES.
ARE YOU AWARE, FOR INSTANCE,
THAT A WOMAN HAS 89
DIFFERENT EROGENOUS ZONES
IN HER BODY?
OH, 89!
WHO SAYS SO?!
THAT PYGMY DOCTOR OF YOURS?!
TO ME, HE'S A GIANT.
HE'S A GIANT!
HE'S A GIANT PHONY!
QUIET!
I AM AFRAID YOU HAVE BEEN
TOTALLY BRAINWASHED.
NOT TOTALLY.
I'VE ONLY REACHED
THE FOURTH PLATEAU.
THE FOURTH WHAT?
DR. ZUCKERBROT'S
THEORY OF SEXUAL AWARENESS.
A FEW LUCKY ONES
MAKE IT ALL THE WAY UP
TO THE NINTH PLATEAU.
WHAT'S HAPPENING UP THERE?
The ultimate orgasm.
OH, I KNEW IT. I KNEW THAT
WAS COMING! THE "O" WORD!
THAT'S WHEN THE EARTH MOVES
AND THE SKY BURSTS OPEN
AND THE WHITE-HOT FLAMES

THAT'S ENOUGH. I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR ANY MORE!
I DON'T WANT

A STRESS SITUATION.
AHHHH.

WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN EATING?
IT'S NOT WHAT I'M EATING,
IT'S WHAT'S EATING ME!
VICTOR, YOU MUST REALLY LEARN
TO DEAL WITH YOUR HOSTILITY.
IT'S POISONING YOUR SYSTEM
AND CORRODING YOUR MIND.
YOU'RE NOT LIVING, VICTOR.
YOU'RE JUST USING UP TIME,
USING UP SPACE, USING UP AIR.
WHAT PLATEAU ARE THEY ON?
WAKE UP, VICTOR. YOU CAN'T JUST
BLEEP OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY.
YOU'VE GOT TO GO
WITH THE FLOW!
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR WEDDING RING?
I HAD IT MELTED DOWN
AND MADE INTO A CHARM FOR HUGO.
HUGO?
DR. ZUCKERBROT.
HE WEARS IT
ON A CHAIN AROUND HIS NECK.
THE SON OF A BITCH
IS WEARING MY WEDDING RING
AROUND HIS NECK?!
[ GROANS ]
I HAVE NO MORE USE FOR IT.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW, VICTOR,
I'M FILING FOR DIVORCE.

CELIA,
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?
WHERE
HAS ALL THE MAGIC GONE?
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR 12 YEARS.
THAT LONG?
WELL, MAYBE THEY WEREN'T
12 GREAT YEARS,
BUT WE HAD A FEW GOOD WEEKS
HERE AND THERE.
LET'S THE TWO OF US
GO BACK TO THE HOTEL, HUH?
IT'S ALL SET UP.
I GOT A BUCKET OF ICE WATER
AND I'LL SET IT NEXT TO THE BED.
WHAT KIND OF A CRAZY IDEA IS THAT?
WELL IT'S NOT MY CRAZY IDEA.
IT'S YOUR CRAZY DOCTOR'S
CRAZY IDEA!
HOW SHALL WE HANDLE THIS --

NO.
NO?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?
THERE WILL BE NO LAWYERS
AND NO DIVORCE.

A HARD TIME?
THERE WILL BE NO DIVORCE
BECAUSE A WIDOW
DOESN'T NEED A DIVORCE.

TWO HOURS AGO.

DON'T LET IT
GET YOU DOWN.

NO, NO, NO. JUST MET HIM
THIS MORNING. NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.

ABOUT THEIR SEX LIFE...
NOT THAT THERE'S

UP THE WRONG GUY.

FOR YOUR OWN GOOD!

AHHH!
OAAHHH!
WH-O-OA!
WE MADE IT.
NOT YET!
YOU BETTER DRIVE, SHIT HEAD.
HAVE I DONE SOMETHING
TO OFFEND YOU?
GET IN THERE.
[ TIRES SCREECH ]
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
A SPARE DICKEY, WOULD YOU?
[ TIRES SQUEAL ]
[ HORN ]
STOP THAT CAR!
STOP IT!
OH, CHRIST.
SORRY.
BOY AM I GLAD I CAUGHT YOU.
[ Irish accent ]
ARE YOU, NOW?
I'VE GOT A DYING MAN
OVER HERE.
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DENOMINATION HE IS,
BUT JUST TO BE
ON THE SAFE SIDE,
WOULD YOU MIND SAYING
A FEW WORDS?
OF COURSE, MY SON.
THAT GOES WITH THE JOB --
TO GIVE LIGHT IN DARKNESS,
COMFORT IN DESPAIR,
TRANQUILITY IN STRESS.
HE'S RIGHT UP HERE
ON THOSE STEPS.
Psst. I'll wait for you.
GET OUT OF HERE.
BEAT IT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
NEVER MIND.
SAVE YOUR OWN ASS.
WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN?
YOU HEARD ME. FUCK OFF.
FATHER,
YOU SAID THE 'F' WORD.
TEMPUS FUGIT. HABEAS CORPUS.
E PLURIBUS UNUM.
IPSO FACTO. CAVEAT EMPTOR.
IN FLAGRANTE DELICTO.
NOLO CONTENDERE. ADESTE FIDELES.
HASTA LA VISTA. AMEN.
TRABUCCO!
WHAT DID HE SAY?
IT'S LATIN.
IT MEANS FORGIVE ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.
REST IN PEACE, MY SON.
HE'S OFF AND RUNNING
WITH THE 50.
DOWN TO THE BALTIMORE
40-YARD LINE.
YEAH, BABY!
GO! GO, BABY!
GO! GO! GO!
GO! GO! GOT IT!
THE PLAY, MADE BY DOUG NETTLES,
WHO SHOWED...
DID YOU SEE THAT CATCH
AND THAT RUN?
...THEY MARK THE BALL
AROUND THE BALTIMORE 26.
TEMPERATURE 29 DEGREES
AT KICK OFF...
AND THE SNOW IS FALLING AGAIN
AT THREE RIVERS...
BRADSHAW IS BACK
DEEP AGAIN. LOTS OF TIME.
GOING WAY DEEP
FOR STALWORTH.
AND IT IS CAUGHT
FOR A TOUCHDOWN.
TOUCHDOWN. TOUCHDOWN.
BWAK.
[ SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ]
[ MOAN ]
[  MOAN ]
HELP!
GOT TO WONDER WHY IT DIDN'T
GO OUT OF BOUNDS...
MISTER. MISTER. COME QUICKLY.
MAN IN BOAT. MAN IN BOAT.
SHUT UP! NOT NOW!
ALL RIGHT, BRADSHAW.
COME ON.
[ GROANS ]
GARY'S RUNNING WITH THE FOOTBALL.
OOH OOH OOH OOH OOH.
THAT'S IT. HEY LOOK AT THAT...
HE SLID ABOUT 5 YARDS.
[ SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ]
SECOND DOWN AND TEN YARDS
TO GO. THE ROOKIE...
[ CLICKS TV OFF ]
[ MOANING CONTINUES ]
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
AHHHH!
OH! OH! OH, GOD!
I THOUGHT
I'D NEVER FIND YOU.
JUST WHO ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR?
WHO AM I LOOKING FOR?!
YOU! TRABUCCO!
THERE'S NOBODY HERE
BY THAT NAME.
[ Chuckles ]
THERE'S NOBODY HERE BY --
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO
TO ME?
I'VE BEEN TO 93 ISLANDS.
IT'S TAKEN ME MONTHS.
I'M SORRY.
YOU GOT THE WRONG ISLAND.
FIX UP HIS BOAT!
GIVE HIM A GALLON OF WATER,
AND AWAY HE GOES!
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE!
DON'T YOU RECOGNIZE ME?!
VICTOR CLOONEY! THE TURKEY!
THE PISS BRAIN!
OH, YEAH. THE SHIT HEAD.
THAT'S THE ONE.
NOW YOU GOT IT.
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SO.
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY.
TOO MUCH SUN OR SOMETHING.
WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
I CAN'T LEAVE. I'M WANTED.
NOT BY ME.
BY THE POLICE.
I'M A FUGITIVE.
THEY CAN'T PIN
GAMBOLA ON YOU.
GAMBOLA NOTHING. I BLEW
UP THE WHOLE FREAKING CLINIC.
WITH YOUR WIFE
AND THE DOCTOR?
YEAH. WHILE THE DOCTOR'S
BACK IN EAST BERLIN.
CELIA RAN OFF WITH
THE RECEPTIONIST.
HERE I AM.
I ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT.
ALMOST DOESN'T COUNT.
IT'S A GODDAMN TROPICAL
PARADISE. HOW'D YOU FIND IT?
I PICKED IT UP CHEAP.
11 HUNDRED DOLLARS.
IT USED TO BE A LEPER COLONY.
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEPERS?
THEY MOVED THEM OUT WHEN
THEY STARTED TESTING THE A-BOMB.
THERE'S LOTS OF RADIATION
AROUND HERE... AND SHARKS.
...AND MAN EATING TURTLES.
[ CRACKING ]
[ CRASH ]
[ CRACKING CONTINUES ]
WELL, I GUESS YOUR STUCK WITH ME.
WHAT HAVE I DONE
TO DESERVE THIS?
AWWW
I'M GLAD
TO SEE YOU, TOO, BUDDY.
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO GET EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.
HUH?
[ BLOWS ]
LUNCH -- IT IS READY!
JUST A MINUTE. THERE'LL
BE ONE MORE FOR LUNCH...
AND DINNER, AND BREAKFAST.
WHERE CAN A WASH UP?
OH, WHEN YOU FIX MY BED...
WOULD YOU PUT A BOARD
UNDER THE MATTRESS -- BAD BACK.
YOU KNOW. WHEN DOES
THE RAINY SEASON START?
TELL ME, TATUPU.
DIDN'T YOU GUYS USED TO HAVE
HUMAN SACRIFICES AROUND HERE --
TOSSING PEOPLE
INTO THAT VOLCANO?
YES,
BUT NOT FOR 200 YEARS.
EVER THINK
OF REVIVING THE CUSTOM?
WELL, FOR THAT YOU MUST HAVE
A LEAP YEAR, AND A FULL MOON,
AND A VIRGIN.
WE DON'T HAVE TO BE
THAT NEAT.
