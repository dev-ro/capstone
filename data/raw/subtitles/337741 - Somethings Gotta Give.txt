The sweet, uncomplicated satisfaction
of the younger woman.
That fleeting age
when everything just falls right into place.
lt's magic time...
and it can render any man anywhere
absolutely helpless.
Some say l'm an expert
on the younger woman.
l guess that's 'cause l've been dating them
for over 40 years.
So, baby, you're rich?
My mother is. Sort of. l mean, not really.
lf she lives within a mile of here,
she's rich.
l guess a hit play
will buy you a house in the Hamptons.
-l'd like to meet your mother.
-No, you wouldn't.
l mean, she's great. She's totally brilliant,
but she's not your type.
You're overlooking
one of the great things about me.
l don't have a type.
She's over 30.
What?
Like you don't know
you have a slight reputation for....
For?
For never dating anyone over 30.
lt just so happens, my dear, that women
of a certain age don't date me.
You ever think of it that way? No.
lt's always me.
l'll call back Monday.
Say you couldn't find me.
Who?
l'll call her later. No, l have the number.
Make a right.
lt's the second driveway on the left.
Right.
Wow.
lt's the perfect beach house.
So what are we gonna do out here,
just the two of us, for two whole days?
Tell me the truth.
Are you at all glad we waited?
Truth? No.
But l'm extremely glad
we're finally gonna do....
You wanna go for a swim?
How long will it take you to change?
-Thirty seconds.
-Really? That long?
By the way, no smoking in the house.
My mom doesn't allow it.
But she allows you
to strip in the front yard.
Bring guys you're dating here to--
She doesn't know everything l do,
when l do it, or where l do it.
The fabulous two-story living room...
which, l predict, we will spend
absolutely no time in whatsoever.
lt's a knockout.
Thank you. l'm very good
at giving this tour, by the way...
although l've never actually done it
while taking off my clothes.
Behind me, the requisite Hamptons deck,
complete with pool and ocean view.
Your pants, please.
Ladies first.
When l first started auctioneering,
someone told me...
if l was nervous, l should just
picture the audience in their underwear.
This gives that a whole new meaning.
You're not nervous now, are you?
l'm always a little nervous.
Put on your bathing suit.
l brought us some champagne,
l'll put it on ice.
Oh, God! What is this?
Okay, you stay where you are.
We have a knife.
-Do you live here?
-Look, mister, l am gonna dial 91 1 ...
and you are not gonna move.
Zoe, hand me the phone.
You don't understand.
l'm a friend of your daughter's.
Yeah? l don't think so.
My daughter is in the city,
and you wander in here high on Ecstasy?
-Honestly, if you'd just--
-No, just stay there.
l was in the lsraeli army.
l can break you in half.
Hello. Yes, l have an intruder in my house.
29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack--
l'm dating your daughter Marin.
She invited me here for the weekend.
She's in her room right now, changing.
You're dating my daughter?
Who would've thought
that would be worse news?
Yeah, sorry. False alarm.
No, he's not a burglar.
He's dating my daughter.
l had no idea
you were coming this weekend.
-You said you had to write.
-l do, but l thought l would do it out here.
l'm an idiot. l should've told you
l was bringing someone.
l'm sorry. l should have told you
we were coming, obviously.
Anyway, here we are.
Hello, l'm the mother.
Harry Sanborn. How are you?
God, sorry. This is my friend, Harry.
My mom, Erica. My aunt, Zoe.
Sorry about that.
We spur-of-the-moment decided
to get out of the city for a couple of days.
That's good.
Honey, does Harry have a robe?
You know what?
l think l should just take off,
let you gals enjoy your weekend....
What?
No, l'm sorry. Don't do that. That's silly.
Zoe and l will leave. You and Harry stay.
Harry, l'm sorry.
l apologize about the near-arrest.
You were very impressive. Very strong.
Very macho.
l don't think l was exactly macho.
Trust me. lf l ever catch a guy
in his underwear in my refrigerator...
l hope l'm half the man you were, Mrs....
Right, okay. Whatever.
All right, then,
l'm definitely gonna hit the road.
Ladies, sensational meeting you.
Doll, give me a call.
Hold on, let's not get so dramatic here.
What are we, four teenagers?
We're sophisticated people.
Why don't we all just stay
for the weekend?
Erica has work to do,
l have papers to grade.
You'll do your thing,
whatever that may be...
and if we wanna hang out together,
we will. lf we don't, we don't.
No reason we should all give up
this spectacular weekend.
Seriously! l can handle it.
l can totally handle it.
l can handle it.
-Hello, Mrs. Barry.
-Hello, Annie.
l would like a slice
of your wonderful meat spread...
and a piece of your best goat cheese.
lmpressive.
She started taking French lessons
after she and my dad split up.
Part of her ''keep busy,
don't look back'' program.
Now she's practically fluent.
-Should l get some dessert?
-Let's buy something.
Should we get a good chocolate cake?
-Not bad.
-Yeah, l am fluent.
l'll be right back.
lt's an epidemic.
Buy some things.
-How about pasta salad?
-We had that last night.
-We did? l don't remember.
-Yeah.
Thank you, madame.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Sorry about that.
-My fault.
-No, it's fine.
So, Harry, what do you do?
l'm one of the owners
of a record company, among other things.
-Really? Which record company?
-Drive-By Records.
Drive-By Records?
ls that a joke? What is that?
lt's a hip-hop label.
Hip-hop? Rap, right.
That's interesting.
Let me see if l get
where you're headed here.
l'm sorry. But look, l hate rap, l really do.
lt's too crude and violent for my taste,
not to mention just a tad misogynistic.
Some people see rap as poetry.
Yeah, but how many words
can you rhyme with ''bitch''?
Next, please.
How are we doing?
Should have left
when she tried to arrest me.
Mom, how's the new play?
Getting happy with it?
You know the thing about me.
l'm 90% hard work, 10% talent...
and so far, the talent part
hasn't exactly kicked in yet.
Right.
-What's your play about?
-About?
l'm not exactly sure,
which is a bit of a problem.
But so far,
it's about a divorced woman, a writer.
She's this high-strung, over-amped,
controlling, know-it-all neurotic.
Who's incredibly cute and loveable.
lt's a comedy.
So how did you two meet?
At a wine auction at Christie's.
Harry was the big buyer of the night.
l kept raising my paddle
just to get her to smile at me.
Before l knew it,
l bought the entire collection.
l mean, every known bottle
of Chateau Margaux.
After that, the least she could do
was share a bottle with me.
Ever been married, Harry?
No, l haven't.
Why do you think that is?
Some people just don't fit the mold,
and so far....
-lf it ain't broke....
-Exactly.
Wait a second.
Aren't you a famous bachelor?
l wouldn't say l'm famous.
Yeah, didn't l read an article about you
in "New York Magazine?"
l guess some people find it interesting
that l've escaped the noose for so long.
That was the title of the article,
The Escape Artist.
l've read that article. That was you?
You were once engaged
to someone really big.
Who was it? Joan Collins? No.
-Wait a minute. Carly Simon?
-Somebody cool like that.
-Not Martha Stewart.
-No, not Martha Stewart.
You could just ask him.
No, this is more fun. lt's like l'm not here.
Harry was once engaged to Diane Sawyer.
-What?
-Right, Diane Sawyer. l love her.
l'm impressed.
Yeah, women your age love that about me.
-You know what l mean.
-Yes, l do.
lt's not a bad thing
to say ''women your age.''
No, l'm sure it was a compliment.
lt's just an accurate observation.
So when was this? The engagement?
A long time ago.
She was this adorable, lanky girl
from Kentucky...
with the greatest pair of legs
l have ever seen.
l never understood her ending up on a job
where she never showed them.
You can't be serious.
l mean, she's Diane Sawyer.
She goes into caves in Afghanistan
with a "shmatteh" on her head.
Who cares about her legs?
You know what,
l hate to eat and run, but--
-No.
-No, wait.
No, come on. This is really fascinating,
what's going on at this table.
Zoe teaches Women's Studies
at Columbia.
Okay, so this is gonna hurt.
No. Let's take you and Erica, for example.
Harry, you've been around the block
a few times, right?
What are you, around 60? 63.
Fantastic.
Never married, which,
if you were a woman, would be a curse.
You'd be an old maid, a spinster.
So instead of pitying you,
they write articles about you.
Celebrate your never marrying.
You're elusive and ungettable,
a real catch.
-Then there's my gorgeous sister here.
-No, wait.
No, this is interesting. Look at her.
She is so accomplished.
The most successful female playwright
since who?
Lillian Hellman?
She's over 50, divorced,
and she sits in night after night...
because the available guys her age,
forgive me for saying this...
want something that looks like Marin.
So the whole over-50 dating scene...
is geared towards
men leaving older women out.
As a result,
the women become more productive...
and therefore, more interesting.
Which in turn
makes them even less desirable...
because men, especially older men,
are threatened and deathly afraid...
of productive and interesting women.
lt is just so clear!
Single older women as a demographic are
about as fucked a group as can ever exist.
God!
What are you, possessed?
How could you say those things?
lt seemed really obvious to me,
the injustice of it.
Our only break
is that men die younger than us.
Then you know what?
Write a dissertation on it.
But don't announce to the world
that l stay in ''night after night.''
By the way, one ''night after night''
would have been enough.
Did you ever realize
that l stay in as part of my job?
And why do you think
l married the director of my plays?
He was the only man l ever saw.
Anyway, l like staying in
and l like this time in my life.
Why do l have to defend myself?
l was married for 20 years. l'm done.
What the hell was that?
l'm sorry. l thought l was on to something.
Honey, what are you doing with this guy?
He's old. He's chauvinistic.
-He's fun.
-He's fun?
How is he fun? He's wrong.
-Yeah, wrong can be fun, Mom.
-Not this wrong.
He's smart and fascinating.
lf you talk to him...
about something
other than his marital status...
you would find out how smart he is.
He owns 10 companies.
What does that mean?
lt means he can't commit, that's what.
Not that, God forbid,
l want him to commit.
Yeah, that l get.
Anyway, he said he thought
you two were very spontaneous and nice...
and then he said he's leaving
as soon as the sun comes up.
What, his car doesn't have headlights?
Wait a minute.
l have no right to get this nuts.
l'm sorry. He's your friend, he's not mine.
-l'm sorry. l love you.
-l love you more.
-No chance in hell he said we were nice.
-Please. None.
-What are they listening to?
-l don't care.
Marvin Gaye?
Will you stop that?
That's disgusting, Zoe. Stop it!
There.
l know she'll never see him after
this weekend. She can't commit, either.
He does sound fun.
Admit it, he's got something.
You felt it, right?
This is nuts.
Mom !
-Did she say ''Mom''?
-Mom, hurry!
l don't know what happened.
We were fooling around.
Then he said he felt funny
and just collapsed.
Harry, what is it?
-l'm okay. l'm fine.
-Does your chest hurt?
lt's like an elephant's sitting on it.
Call 91 1, tell them to send an ambulance.
Marin, now!
Oh, my God.
-What are you doing?
-Mouth-to-mouth.
You fucking guy!
We need an ambulance right away, please.
29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.
Come on, Harry! Look at me!
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.
-What have we got?
-Cardiac arrest.
Sinus tach 120.
-B.P.?
-150 over 95.
-Right here?
-On three.
All right. Careful.
We've already got a line in.
Switch over to monitors.
How are we doing here?
He's had 30 minutes of chest pains,
nausea, shortness of breath.
Pulse 104, respiration's 18.
Let's get the CBC, CMP,
cardiac panel, and 12-lead EKG.
Mr. Sanborn, l'm Dr. Mercer.
Are you in any pain right now?
l feel some pressure in my chest.
lt's real tight.
-Will you show me where the pain is?
-Right here.
What were you doing
when the pain started?
l was kissing a beautiful woman.
-Were you having intercourse?
-Unfortunately, no.
-Sense of humor intact.
-Yeah.
Give him an aspirin, metoprolol,
5 mg, and hang a nitro drip.
-Mr. Sanborn?
-Yeah.
Your EKG shows
you have a blocked artery...
which is not allowing enough oxygen
to get to the heart muscle.
l'm having a heart attack?
We're gonna stop it, but l need to know
what medications you take.
l take Lipitor.
Chew this.
-Anything else?
-And a white one for blood pressure.
What about Viagra?
Mr. Sanborn, did you take
any Viagra today?
No Viagra.
Good, l just needed to be sure
because l put nitroglycerin into your drip.
And if you had taken Viagra,
the combination could be fatal.
-Your dad's gonna be okay.
-He's not my dad.
l'm sorry. Your granddad is gonna be okay.
Thank you so much.
We're not related.
-He's a friend.
-Sorry.
l'm Dr. Mercer.
Mr. Sanborn did have a mild heart attack.
l gave him something to dissolve the clot
and it worked beautifully.
He's very lucky.
Another half-hour,
l don't know if this would have worked.
This was very intense.
He's doing great.
l gave him something to help him sleep.
lt might make him a little loopy at first,
but then it should knock him out.
-You're Mrs. Sanborn?
-No!
No, l'm Erica Barry.
He was having dinner at our house.
l just met him this afternoon.
-You're Erica Barry.
-Yes.
-The playwright?
-Yes.
What a pleasure. l'm a huge fan.
-Really?
-A huge fan.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you, Doctor.
-Erica. Green tea.
-That's hot. Thank you.
-You're welcome. May l?
-Yeah, sure.
This is very sweet of you.
ln medical school
you learn what can keep you up all night...
without making you nuts.
You know, l heard
you had a house in the Hamptons.
l am a big fan. l think l've seen
every play you've ever written.
l think some were written
before your time.
There are some Marin's never seen.
l'm pretty sure l've seen them all.
And l saw the last one twice.
Julian, we've got a walk-in,
may need stitches.
Okay, thanks.
l'll check on Mr. Sanborn.
lf he's asleep, you all get some shut-eye
and come back in the morning.
Great to meet you, Erica. Ladies.
Okay.
Now that's the perfect guy for you.
He's adorable.
Mother, l have never seen a man
less interested in me.
Or more interested in you.
Me?
-He's 30 years old.
-No, he's older than that.
Who cares how old he is?
He's not my type:
He's a gorgeous, wholesome doctor.
But he's perfect for you
and he's hot for you. He's really perfect.
Okay, stop it.
He likes my work, he doesn't like me.
l would never....
Shut up.
Oh, God. ls he all right?
Harry, over here.
Hi, honey. l wanna go home.
Can you call Leo...
-to pick me up?
-No, you've got to get back into bed.
Woman, you saved my life.
-Get a nurse.
-Nurse!
l thank you from the bottom of my....
Even unconscious, he's a lech! Get off!
You shouldn't be standing.
lt's all right. Thank you.
l gotta take a whiz, girls.
We'll take care of that for you.
Okay, l'd like to see that.
Somebody better get it.
What can l do you for?
l'm here to pick up Harry Sanborn.
Hi, l'm Dr. Mercer.
Come on, l'll take you to him.
And you are?
l'm Leo Hoffman.
l'm Harry's personal assistant.
Do a little chef, little driving, little
party planning, whatever the man needs.
Sounds like a pretty interesting job.
Going on six years
and never a dull moment.
Okay, Harry,
looks like we're gonna have to let you go.
Take it easy, kids.
l just sat up a little too fast.
Doc, tell them.
Am l in good shape?
How were my tests this morning?
He's doing extremely well.
-Can l hug him?
-Absolutely.
Let's not get goofy.
We got nothing but good news here.
Knock, knock.
-Hi.
-Hey.
-l'll catch you on the way out.
-Thanks a lot, Doc.
So, l'm some great date?
Yeah. Mr. Excitement.
Tell me something.
We haven't actually had sex yet, have we?
No, we haven't. You're correct on that one.
Something to live for.
Down to the cheek.
Hold on, Tarzan,
we're still moving. Slowly.
Harry, l'm sorry,
but l can't let you travel quite yet.
l ain't going back in there.
l can't put you in a car
and l can't leave you in the parking lot.
l won't sue you,
if that's what you're thinking.
l'll sign whatever you like.
Just let me go back to the city.
Here's my best offer.
l won't put you in the hospital
if you stay nearby for a few days.
Get a nurse and let me keep an eye
on you until you get your strength back.
Stay nearby.
Doc, where do you suggest l go?
Somebody please explain to me
how l ended up babysitting this guy.
This is the best turkey sandwich
l've ever had in my life.
-You're not even listening to me.
-l am. Don't get all pissy.
l come out here for peace and quiet...
and suddenly, l'm a character
in a Kaufman and Hart play.
And the phone doesn't stop.
And it's never for me.
Sorry to interrupt.
-No, that's fine, Leo, l'll take it.
-No, that's okay.
l don't mind washing them.
-No.
-Okay. How you doing?
The man does not know my name,
and l'm doing his dishes.
l said l'll take it back tomorrow, okay?
Great.
l'll take care of it. One second.
Erica, where shall l put this?
Right here. l'll take it.
Harry has a really bad headache.
Do you have any Tylenol?
Extra-strength would be fantastic.
Hi! l'm Tania.
-Hi.
-Harry's second assistant.
Dave Klein. Her assistant.
Nice to meet you.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
''What should l do with this?''
lt's an empty water glass.
What are the choices?
Okay, l'm getting out of your hair.
So you're not ready to show me
any new pages?
l'm not putting any pressure on you.
l'm just asking.
Dad! l didn't know you were here.
Just on my way out, "bubee."
l was gonna drive back to the city
with Zoe, but l'd rather go with you.
Actually, l have someone to meet
before l go.
Wait.
You're leaving? Zoe is leaving?
The entourage is leaving?
And l'll be stuck here with him, alone?
The hospital is sending over a nurse
in the morning.
ln the morning? That's 19 hours from now.
Okay, l can handle this.
l'll just get myself into a Zen place.
Play music, cook, write. Focus.
God.
Thank you.
Four mai tais at lunch
is a bit much for anybody.
Hi.
Can l call you right back, doll? Thank you.
-What's up?
-Here's the thing.
l don't want to play the part of
the uptight nurse to your bad-boy patient.
lf you wanna have another heart attack,
go ahead.
But l have work,
and no time to run to the hospital...
because you're filling
your already-clogged arteries with smoke.
But more importantly...
l'd rather not have my freshly painted
house smell like a pool hall.
Have you always been like this,
or do l bring it out in you?
Just, you know....
l don't think l've ever had this effect
on a woman before.
What effect?
l don't quite recognize it.
That's how l know l never had it before.
So, you don't sleep?
l only need about four hours a night.
Me, too.
l never slept eight hours in my life.
Me, either. l wish l could.
Do you want me to shut these?
The sun comes in pretty strong
in the morning.
Sure.
Who were you talking to at this hour?
A friend in LA. lt's only 10:00 on the Coast.
And that's not past her bedtime?
So you don't get more mellow
as the hours pass.
Good night, Harry.
Can l ask you one other thing?
What's with the turtlenecks?
lt's the middle of summer.
Seriously, why do you care what l wear?
Just curious.
l've always liked them,
and l'm just a turtleneck kind of gal.
You never get hot?
No.
Never?
Not lately.
Finally.
Oh, God!
l'm sorry.
God, am l sorry.
-What are you doing?
-l was just trying to find the kitchen.
Back here?
l got confused. lt was dark, and....
l didn't really see anything.
Just your tits and a little....
Good-bye, Mrs. Barry.
Good-bye? You're leaving?
No, that's not good.
-l've been fired.
-No, you just started.
Not fired, darling. Just not needed.
Not needed? What are you talking about?
Of course she's needed. We need her.
No. l'm actually feeling pretty perky today.
Making quite a comeback.
Sorry for your trouble, Mrs. Gimble.
Take care, dear.
You've been wonderful.
Listen, about last night--
How about we never
talk about that, okay?
Anyway, l was at the drugstore.
Your prescriptions were ready.
They said to take these two with food,
this one without.
You were in silhouette.
l think that's talking about it.
l really didn't see all that much.
There you go.
-Okay, l won't mention it again, but--
-Going to work.
You saw my ass...
you don't see me acting nuts
and wearing glasses and hats...
and weird outfits!
Yes or no? What's the deal?
-Can l go?
-You still getting dizzy?
-Not as much.
-Out of breath?
Only sometimes.
-Good. How's Erica treating you?
-Who?
Erica.
Her.
She is a major piece of work.
Doc, the woman wears turtlenecks
in the middle of the summer.
She's beyond uptight.
Almost makes her fun to be around.
Uptight? That's funny,
l haven't noticed that.
Try living with her.
l actually saw her naked last night.
-That doesn't sound so uptight.
-lt was an accident.
She thought l was asleep,
l thought her room was the kitchen.
You know what Freud said.
There are no accidents.
Trust me, this was an accident.
Although, why would she
be walking around naked...
when she knows l'm 20 feet away?
Why would you think
her bedroom was the kitchen?
lt was dark. lt was 2:00 in the morning.
That could explain
why she was walking around naked.
Deep breath.
You know, l've never seen
a woman that age naked before.
You're kidding.
We're not all doctors, baby.
l think she's very beautiful.
And she's a fantastic writer, you know.
No, l don't know.
She's pretty major.
So you date her daughter?
Okay, now she's a great chick.
Must take after her father.
Which reminds me...
what about Mr. Midnight here?
When can l be up and running
in that department?
l think Mr. Midnight needs to stay put
for another couple of weeks.
But it won't kill me when l do it, right?
No, it's exercise. lt'll be good for you.
After a heart attack, rule of thumb is:
lf you can climb a flight of stairs,
you can have sex.
So you're saying he can't travel at all?
Not even by plane?
-Train?
-l don't think so.
Been tough?
He fired his nurse after an hour.
Now he says he doesn't even need one.
He's a bit of a workout.
How are you holding up?
-Me?
-You.
l'm fine. Fine.
One more ''fine'' and l won't believe you.
Wait, where's my....
There.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
Hello?
Hi. No, l'm sorry,
l haven't been able to get back.
Part of the play takes place in Paris...
so l keep listening to French music,
hoping to get inspired.
No, it's not helping at all.
l'm trying.
lt's not exactly
flowing out of me yet, but....
Pick you up around 7:00?
What about the patient?
Like he said, he doesn't need a nurse.
l'm walking around the house!
Oh, no.
-Hi.
-Listen.
l've decided to get over
that whole ''you saw me naked'' thing.
-So let's not deal with it anymore, okay?
-Good.
Because l have been hiding from you
all day.
Do you wanna come in?
l don't wanna break your rhythm
or anything like that.
That would be wishful thinking.
Nice painting.
l'm gonna venture out there
and go for a short walk.
-You up to that?
-My doctor recommended it.
l got to build up to climbing stairs
and stuff like that.
You wouldn't wanna join me?
That means you don't want me to?
No. l was asking if you wanted to.
Yeah, l would. But l don't like to break
once l start writing, so l shouldn't.
l mean, not that a little fresh air
would hurt.
lt's just a walk, Erica.
Not a marriage proposal.
You know my name.
Erica Jane Barry.
l looked you up on the lnternet.
Do you know that there are over
8,000 web sites that mention you?
-That's not possible.
-No, it's true.
l know everything about you now,
and not because of last night.
No, l understood.
-Actually, l looked you up, too.
-You did?
Yeah. l know you grew up in LA,
which l thought nobody did.
You started your own record label at 29.
Very impressive.
Sold it at 40, even more impressive.
Then you started a magazine,
dabbled in the lnternet.
And then you invested
in a small record company...
which you turned into the second-largest
hip-hop label in the world.
-lt's exhausting just hearing about it.
-Yeah, l know...
but the truth is, it goes by fast, doesn't it?
-Like the blink of an eye.
-Yeah.
Look at this.
l notice that you have
bowls of those all over your house.
lt's so crazy, l know.
But l just think they're beautiful.
But why do you only
pick up the white ones?
l don't pick up only the white ones.
So you really are crazy.
No, l only pick up the white ones. Oh, God.
What does that mean?
That l'm controlling?
Unadventurous? What?
So you're as hard on yourself
as you are on everyone else.
Something to remember me by.
Can l ask you something?
Yeah, sure. Go ahead, shoot.
What's with all the young girls?
What's the story there, really?
l just like to travel light.
You just like to travel.... God!
l'm sorry, but what does that mean?
Now, see, a 30-year-old gets that.
You mean falls for it.
l mean accepts it. Acceptance is key.
Okay, if that's what you want.
A non-threatening woman...
doesn't get your number,
you get to run the show.
l think our relationship is growing,
by the way.
Have you noticed? l'm serious.
Maybe we just need
to get out of the house.
Now, you may notice, interestingly,
we're walking back toward the house...
and it's getting a little rocky again.
Of course it's getting rocky.
We're talking about you.
See, l'll accept that slight hostility...
because l'm enjoying
your company so much.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
But l think l'll stay down here
and watch the sun set. You interested?
Ringside seat.
Big dinner date?
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
with your doctor.
My doctor.
-Because he's not too young for you?
-No.
He's totally too young for me.
But we're just having dinner,
it's not a date.
Does he know that?
l'm gonna tell him.
But l doubt he thinks of it that way. Okay?
l doubt that you doubt it.
Anyway, you may like it.
Think of it this way:
He's non-threatening, won't get
your number, you get to run the show.
-That is so unfair.
-Trust me.
lt could be a great night.
Look who's answering the door.
And look who's at the door.
l brought you something.
A heart-healthy dinner from our cafeteria.
Why, thank you.
Hello.
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.
Hi, it's Marin. l'm not in right now,
so leave a message and l'll call you back.
Hey, it's me.
Just sitting around,
looking at your baby pictures.
Thinking of you.
You've reached Brooke and Shannon.
For Brooke, push one,
for Shannon, push two.
Everybody is out but old Har.
Old.
Old Har.
Top of the heap.
-Julian, can l ask you something?
-Anything.
How old are you?
l'm 36.
So l'm almost 20 years older than you.
lsn't that an enormous amount of years
to be older than somebody?
l don't think it matters at all.
-You don't?
-l don't.
Okay.
But in terms of us...
you just want us to be friends, right?
Honestly? No.
-So what do you wanna be?
-l think l'd embarrass you if l told you.
l was embarrassed
just getting dressed to see you.
This may surprise you, but some women
consider me quite the guy.
l've never been married. l'm a doctor.
You wouldn't believe
what catnip that is for some women.
Yes, l would.
Don't you like girls your own age?
l do, but l've never met one
l've reacted to...
quite like this.
And when something happens to you
that's never happened to you before...
don't you have to at least
find out what it is?
l suppose. l don't know.
This is an area that's tricky for me.
See, l don't really date all that much
or all that well.
Come on, you must beat them away
with a stick.
You're kidding, right?
No. Men my age,
or at least the ones l've met....
l'm not that regular a person,
and they really like regular.
Men your age may be really stupid.
Did you ever think of that?
Yes, l have. Many times.
l knew you'd smell good.
lt's just soap.
-Erica...
-What?
-...you're incredibly sexy.
-No.
l swear to God l'm not.
l'm back!
Have fun?
lt was interesting.
Good night, Harry.
Night.
Get rid of that. That's good.
Harry 37?
Of course. Relentless.
l don't understand
how he knows everything.
ln her pj's.
''Pajama party.'' Oh, man.
We are cute.
This is pretty unusual for me.
l'm not used to having sleepovers.
Me, either.
Really? With your social life?
My dear, you're confusing
sex with sleeping.
Sleeping is something
that l prefer to do alone.
Okay. Good to know.
What are you hungry for?
What are my choices?
l know you think l'm not
very discriminating when it comes to--
Please. What difference does it make
what l think of you?
l can't even imagine what you think of me.
Pancakes, pasta, leftover coq au vin.
-Grilled cheese?
-Pancakes.
Totally what l wanted.
You ever miss being married?
l bet you were great at it.
Sometimes. Yeah, at night.
But not that much anymore.
Was one of us
just saying something interesting?
You said you can't imagine
what l think of you.
You don't have to answer that.
Okay.
lf you had an opinion, l'd be curious.
Will you tell me first
why you only miss being married at night?
The phone doesn't ring
that much at night...
and the whole alone thing
happens at night.
Sleeping by myself took some
getting used to, but l got the hang of it.
You gotta sleep in the middle of the bed.
lt's not healthy to have a side
when no one has the other side.
Now l'm convinced
that what l think about you is right.
You're a tower of strength.
Try not to rate my answer.
l'm sorry, okay?
You know what you're like?
You're like one of those great portraits
you see over a fireplace.
Words have been invented
to describe women like you.
Such as?
Flinty.
lmpervious.
-So you think l'm inhuman?
-No.
l think you're formidable.
Cold, distant,
like l'm frozen in some painting?
Not at all.
But l do think that you use your strength
to separate yourself from everyone.
But it's thrilling
when your defenses are down...
and you're not isolated.
That, l believe, is your winning combo.
Killer combo, actually.
You know, l can't decide if you hate me...
or if you're the only person
who ever really got me.
l don't hate you.
-You don't?
-No.
Mom?
Surprise!
-Hi!
-Room service.
Honey, what are you doing here
at this hour?
l had this big benefit tonight.
Then l went out with a bunch of friends
and l checked my messages.
And l got this
so sad phone call from Harry.
So bored out here, so l figured l should
come up and see how you're doing.
Thank you so much
for the gorgeous flowers, by the way.
They're so huge.
lt's a pleasure.
That is so sweet.
You guys are making pancakes?
You're both in your pj's.
l feel like l'm interrupting.
Don't be silly. You know l never sleep.
This one doesn't sleep either.
Hello?
No, l'm here, babe. l made record time.
ls everybody still there?
Okay, bye.
-Mar?
-Yeah?
Now that you're here,
why don't you finish the pancakes...
and l'll get back to work?
Mom, l just got here.
By the way,
Dad totally stood me up today.
l was supposed to have lunch with him
at Barney's, and he never showed up.
-Was he always like this?
-Honey, l don't know.
That's what happens
when a couple gets divorced.
The kid inherits all the problems.
Not that l'm a kid.
So how are you? How are you feeling?
So tell me, when can you go home?
l really am gonna do a little work.
So why don't you just finish this?
You two catch up,
and you know how to fix these.
You don't want pancakes anymore?
l don't.
No, l don't.
l'm breaking up with Harry.
What do you mean? Why?
-l met someone else.
-ln the two days since you've been gone?
You know me, my life's crazy.
l meet a thousand new people every day.
Besides, let's face it.
He's insanely too old for me.
l'd be nuts to keep this thing going.
True. But you know, he's....
l know. He's soulful
when you don't expect it, right?
Oh, my God, he's unnerving.
Mom, listen.
l was thinking, if you could handle this...
you and Harry.
l can't handle it,
wouldn't want to handle it.
You're only saying that because you think
that he and l have had sex.
Lower your voice.
-Haven't you?
-Never, not even close, l swear to God.
l'm putting this out there...
because for two people
who are convinced they've got life beat...
something was cooking in the kitchen
last night other than pancakes.
-Hello?
-l've waited a reasonable amount of time...
before calling you
even though you've been on my mind...
since l woke up at 5:15.
l'm wondering
when we could go out again.
l have to work the next few nights.
lf we wait till next week,
you'll chicken out, so how's Friday?
lt's a date night, but that's a good thing.
Who is this?
l'm kidding.
Funny. Can you meet me
at The Grill at 8:00?
Yes, seems fine.
l look forward to seeing you, too.
-He's all yours.
-Stop that. How'd he take it?
He just took care of it for me.
He was an ace. Elegant.
He said our fate was to be friends.
Oh, my God.
He was breaking up with me.
l didn't even....
-He's a genius.
-That's not possible. He wouldn't.
He absolutely did.
And you know what? lt doesn't matter...
'cause we're done
and we both feel fine about it. Okay?
Clean slate.
l gotta go.
Okay.
Now, Erica.
Try to think of this as the smartest thing
you've ever done for yourself.
Candles?
Romantic.
l'm sorry.
For what?
-l just kissed you, and l....
-No, honey.
l kissed you.
l know that one was me.
Try not to keep score.
Soft lips.
l'm so glad they still work.
l haven't used them for kissing
in such a long time.
More like for wearing lipstick,
and whistling, and....
Well, well.
Now look who's got
something that works.
You didn't even take any Viagra....
Kiss me before you make it go away.
This could be world-class interesting.
Yeah.
Having any doubts?
Yes.
Me, too.
But so far...
the kissing is spectacular.
l'm not grading you, l'm just mentioning it.
Like, brilliant.
l can't get past your damn turtleneck.
Cut it off.
Please.
Cut it off.
-Aren't you full of surprises?
-Yeah.
Yes.
You're beautiful.
Open your eyes so l know you hear me.
Beautiful.
What about birth control?
Menopause.
Who's the lucky boy?
l think we should
take your blood pressure.
My blood pressure?
l think it's irresponsible not to.
-Nobody but you would stop me.
-Yeah, so you're lucky.
God, l can't see.
My glasses.
120 over 80! Baby!
Oh, my God.
l do like sex.
You certainly do.
Oh, God.
So this is what you're supposed to do
on a rainy afternoon?
l really thought l was...
sort of closed up for business.
l never expected this.
Nothing's ever surprised me more.
This is crazy.
l can't remember the last time l cried.
l think l'm overwhelmed.
Me, too.
Oh, God, that's the perfect word.
Baby, l had sex three days
after a heart attack and l didn't die.
That's gotta be some kind of a record.
Yeah.
Let's just not brag about this
to your doctor, okay?
Honey...
l may not be many things,
but one thing l am is discreet.
Yeah.
What?
You know l'm not good
at being monogamous, right?
Monogamous?
Please. l hardly know you.
But why Paris?
l always wanted to write a play
that ended there.
People need romance like that.
lf somebody like me doesn't write it,
where will they get it, real life?
Excuse me?
What do you call this?
Eating eggs by candlelight in our robes...
after....
Sorry.
Where do you like to eat in Paris?
l love this little bistro called the
Grand Colbert, behind the Palais-Royal.
lt is the best roast chicken in the universe.
You'd be fun to go to Paris with.
lt is the best city to stay up all night in.
When is your birthday?
-February.
-Mine's January.
How about
if we still know each other by then...
we go to Paris for our birthdays?
Maybe.
You just said.... You know something,
l have no idea how to do this.
l don't know how to be intimate,
but not intimate.
The color is draining from your face.
Look, l'm gonna pee.
Take one of your blood pressure pills...
and when l get back,
let's not talk anymore. Oh, God.
You're the funniest girl
l ever had sex with.
Well, that's something.
Honey.
l think l should go back to my room.
Let you get some sleep.
-Let me sleep?
-Yeah.
Right. You usually send the girls home.
But l am home.
l'm an old dog, you know?
lt's perfectly.... Whatever.
This was...
a great night.
For me.
Me, too.
Yeah?
At one point...
l even thought...
soul mates.
Good night.
l'd like to try sleeping with you.
Oh, my God!
Hi.
What time do you think it is?
Can you see this?
Not really. lt looks like it says...
1 1 :00?
-lt is 1 1 :00.
-lt is? No way.
lt can't be.
Oh, my God,
that would mean we slept eight hours?
-lmpossible.
-Yeah.
Whoa, Nellie.
A little dizzy.
Oh, no. Okay.
You just stay still.
Here you are, here's the clicker.
You have a doctor's appointment
in an hour.
l'll make some coffee, get you your pills,
whip us up some French toast.
l have the best maple syrup ever.
You are a woman to love.
''You are a woman to love.''
What the hell does that mean?
Okay, buddy, your echo looks real good.
-l'm sending you back to the city.
-Good.
These past few days
have done wonders for you.
Yeah, l've been working
on that stair thing.
l can do it, by the way.
Do what?
Climb a flight of stairs.
Several times, actually.
Way to go.
How's Erica?
Erica, as it turns out,
is an amazing woman.
-She's just--
-That's wonderful.
l think she's wonderful.
l think she's wonderful, too.
Give her my best.
Julian?
Thank you...
for everything.
You're gonna be okay.
l am?
This is the second time l've done this.
lt's like l get overcome or something.
lt's so out of the blue.
lt's pretty common to become emotional
after having an episode like you've had.
Everything takes on a new meaning.
So it's not crazy for a guy to do something
so totally out of character...
after having a heart attack?
-You mean like crying?
-Yeah.
And completely changing their taste.
Like, suddenly...
really liking something that
you never thought you could ever like.
Ever.
lt's unnerving.
You can expect just about anything
right now.
People have done some wild things
after having a heart attack.
But most people go back
to being themselves, right?
l'm gonna go back to being me...
aren't l?
We'll see.
Here you go.
You can have these back now.
l confiscated them on your first night here.
Thank you, darling.
Try not to smoke them.
l packed you a sandwich
just in case your blood sugar got low...
with some of that iced tea you like...
and a non-fat, low cholesterol cookie,
and a peach.
What a doll.
You got something else.
Something to remember me by.
There is that.
We'll always have Paris.
Bad joke.
-Honey?
-Yeah?
No words can ever express my gratitude...
for taking me in...
and taking care of me.
Your heart attack could be the best thing
that ever happened to me.
l love ya.
l love you, too.
lf that's what you said.
l don't know if it ends in a ''ya,''
if it's an official ''l love you,'' but....
You're not like anybody.
-l knew you'd call.
-Who? lt's me.
What's wrong?
l had breakfast with Dad,
and we're talking.
He starts looking all weird, and tells me
he met someone three weeks ago...
and that it's really something.
And then he tells me he's getting married.
Why am l reacting this way?
l'm almost 30 years old!
Wait. Who is he marrying?
l don't know.
Some chick he met three weeks ago.
She's two years older than me.
She's an ear, nose, and throat doctor.
Has he lost his mind?
l have this huge auction tonight...
and l'm really upset.
My shrink is away for two weeks.
Can you come in?
l know you're working, but just, please?
l get that he has a right to get remarried,
but he doesn't even know her.
And she's my age!
Do you know what that's like?
That's beyond creepy.
lt's not like l think he's replacing me,
because l know he isn't.
And l know l'm too old
to act like this. lt's nuts!
First of all, please don't smoke.
lf he is replacing anyone, it's me, not you.
And all the statistics say...
that divorced men usually remarry.
lt's the way they're built.
Wanna know the answer
to why l'm always with the wrong guy?
This is why. Because the wrong guy
can't do this to you.
This is my big fear, that some guy
can get me unglued like this.
And this is just Dad!
We know this about me.
l am not cut out for this kind of drama.
l think it's the drama in life
that makes you strong.
You always say things to me like this.
You never understand
that everyone isn't like you.
l'm sorry,
but if l were you, and my ex-husband...
the man l still allow
to direct all my plays...
were getting remarried to
a 33-year-old ear, nose, and throat babe...
l'd be bonkers! And look at you.
You've never looked better, by the way.
Marin, we're all set.
l gotta go sell $40 million worth of art.
Can you do one other really big thing
for me? Just say yes, please.
Anything, "bubee."
l need you to come out to dinner tonight
with me, Dad, and the fiancee.
Absolutely not. No.
-Mom, you have to!
-No, l am not.
Yes, because he wants me to meet her.
l can't go alone.
l asked him if you could come
and he said it's fine, and she said it's fine.
You'll have to meet her, anyway,
so we might as well do it together.
Come on. Please?
You know you can handle it.
Okay, that's it.
You see that look on your face?
That's the gene l didn't get.
Welcome to Christie's...
and this evening's sale
of lmpressionist and modern art.
The auctioneer may open bidding...
on any lot below the reserve
by placing a bid on behalf of the seller.
Let's start with lot number one,
the Renard, showing here.
And $80,000 is bid with my absent bidder.
$85,000, gentleman's bid.
$90,000, still with me.
$100,000, $1 10,000, $120,000...
...$130,000, $140,000, gentleman's bid.
And fair warning.
l guess l got stood up.
Would you like to order?
Why not? l put the tie on and everything.
Can you bring me another?
Another drink, ma'am?
Good, thank you so much.
So delicious!
-Thirsty?
-l've had a very big week, Dave.
l forgot how these slip right down.
l'm fine.
So, Kristen, where did you go to medical...
school? l'm so sorry.
The University of Pennsylvania.
Actually, l went to school
in Philadelphia, too.
-Yeah, Bryn Mawr girl.
-You're kidding.
My mom went to Bryn Mawr.
Wow. So not only are you
marrying my father...
but our mothers went to the same college.
-Shall we order?
-Absolutely.
Erica, do l like duck?
Yes, it's rabbit you hate.
l'll give you a list
of everything he likes and dislikes.
Let's let her figure some things out
for herself.
l'm not talking about that.
After all, she did go to medical school.
Not in front of the kids.
-What do you see that you like?
-What are you having?
l don't know.
l'm looking at the grilled salmon.
Who would like what?
Mom, are you okay?
-Sure you're okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.
l'm fine.
-You sure?
-Yes.
Good.
lf we wanted to go pasta,
we could get the fresh rigatoni.
Grilled free-range chicken teriyaki.
l'm not sure. What about you?
l'm sorry. Maybe l need a little air.
-Are you okay?
-Fine. l'll be right back.
-Excuse me.
-l'm sorry.
-Hey.
-Hello, Harry.
-Hi.
-l don't know if you know....
Oh, God, l'm so stupid.
What?
-Erica.
-Harry, l gotta go.
Slow down. You wanna kill me?
Taxi.
-She's just a friend.
-She looks like a real buddy kind of girl.
Come on, it's just a dinner.
Harry, look, here's the problem.
l really like you.
l really like you.
Yeah, but l love you like you.
l do, l love you.
l think that we should consider...
that maybe we're getting
a little ahead of ourselves.
-Do you?
-Yeah.
l am like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
l've never been the dumb girl before.
lt ain't so great.
Let's just calm down.
-l had these plans before l even met you.
-Okay.
-l mean, l do like seeing you. l do.
-Yeah.
-And l'm always surprised by it.
-Surprised by it?
What was l thinking?
l have never lied to you.
l have always told you
some version of the truth.
The truth doesn't have versions, okay?
Will you cut me a little slack?
-My life has just been turned upside down.
-Mine, too.
-Then let's each get our bearings.
-l don't want my bearings.
l've had my bearings
my whole goddamn life.
l felt something with you
that l never really knew existed.
Do you know what that's like?
After a 20-year marriage,
to feel something...
for another person that is so....
Right. Not your problem.
Do you know that l've written this,
but l never really got it?
-Do you know what this is?
-No.
This is heartbroken.
How's that for impervious?
You're killing me.
l just wish
that it had lasted more than a week.
Me, too.
That is a terrible thing to say.
You know, the life l had before you...
l knew how to do that.
l could do that forever.
But now look at me.
What am l gonna do with all this?
Taxi.
Can you wait just a second?
The truth is...
l don't know how to be a boyfriend.
That's what you have to say
after all of this?
That you don't know
how to be a boyfriend?
That's not a small thing.
Are we done?
l don't know.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
-Came in by cab.
-He's got a seven.
Vital signs are stable.
Respirator is on its way.
Fifteen minutes of chest pains,
hospitalized a week ago with an Ml.
-Let's switch over to monitors.
-Hang a nitro drip.
You can't.
l took Viagra.
You have been through this before.
Let's run a 12-lead EKG.
You're having chest pain right now?
No. And the pain l was having was sharp,
not like before.
That's good. ''Not like before''
is what we like to hear.
l was really out of breath,
like l couldn't catch it.
Okay. Give him an aspirin
and let's run a blood gas.
What were you doing
at the onset of the pain?
Having a fight with someone. A woman.
-Can a woman give you chest pains?
-Are you kidding?
-Love hurts, haven't you heard?
-l've heard.
l just never personally experienced it.
-You've been lucky.
-Yeah, lucky.
All right, your EKG looks perfectly normal.
Your heart rate's good.
The kind of pain you describe
is not the kind we generally worry about.
l think what you experienced
was hyperventilation brought on by stress.
Stress?
And in case you haven't heard,
stress can give you a heart attack.
l have no idea what you're up to...
gallivanting out and about at this hour
one week after having a heart attack.
But if you were my dad...
l would have you home
in bed, recuperating.
''lf you were my dad.''
Hi, it's Erica.
l'm not here, so leave me a message.
You have one new message. Message one:
Erica, hi, it's Julian.
l'm in the restaurant, and l'm just
wondering if you're on your way.
lt's about 8.20.
lt's a lovely night out here, it's a nice....
Oh, my!
Yeah, go figure.
Mom, we're going into town.
Okay.
Are you crying?
Yeah.
lt's my new thing.
l've gotten abnormally brilliant at it.
Why? What is it?
l'm in love.
Ain't it great?
Seems like l gotta learn how to do
that ''love them and leave them'' stuff.
-Mom, l hate this.
-No.
Now do you get my theory about all this?
You gotta self-protect.
You don't really buy this stuff you say,
do you?
You don't actually think
that you can outsmart getting hurt?
l think it's worth trying.
Listen to me.
You can't hide from love
for the rest of your life...
because maybe it won't work out...
maybe you'll become unglued.
lt's not a way to live.
Are you telling me this is good,
what's happened to you?
l think you should
consider the possibility...
that you and l are more alike
than you realize.
l let someone in.
And l had the time of my life.
l've never had the time of my life.
l know, baby.
And l say this...
from the deepest part of my heart.
What are you waiting for?
-Great party.
-Thanks.
Harry, you're looking grand, man.
-Hi.
-Hey, good to see you.
You having fun?
Not quite.
l got you something great
at the farm stand.
These are for you to give me
when you apologize.
l hope you know how mortified l am
by my behavior.
l was gonna get in touch,
or send you a note, something.
-A note?
-A note.
That's a little chilly.
l'm embarrassed.
l just haven't been myself lately.
What can l say?
Just tell me you're sorry.
l am sorry.
Then you could kiss me.
Kiss you?
-You're gonna forgive me if l kiss you?
-l think so.
No one on earth
would forgive you for that kiss.
May l?
l forgive you.
Yes!
-lt's the best thing you've ever written.
-lt is?
-lt's wonderful.
-lt is?
Yes, it's sweet, it's smart, it's funny.
How great is it for you
that l'm not intimidated by your brilliance?
Must we go through this every time?
Come here.
Good. That's very good.
Anyway, you know what l'm gonna do?
Oh, my God.
l gotta tell you.
l'm totally excited about this audition.
lt's such a great part.
Supporting, but she's
a really funny character.
There's this totally hilarious scene...
where she's dating this older,
chauvinistic guy...
and just as they're about to do it,
he moans.
So she's just thinking
that he's really into her...
except he's having a heart attack.
And she's totally creeped out...
and her mom,
who basically despises the guy...
rushes in and gives him CPR
and saves his life.
Are you okay?
lsn't that funny?
''Hold on, let's not get so dramatic here.
''What are we, four teenagers?
''We're all sophisticated people.
''Why can't we all stay for the weekend?
''Your mother has work to do,
l've got papers to grade.
''You do what you're going to do,
whatever that might be--''
l need to talk to you.
Got a minute?
-So your play is about us?
-No, it's about me.
-Am l in it?
-A guy like you is in it, but he's not you.
What happens to this guy who's not me?
l haven't totally decided.
He can live, or he can die.
-What are you leaning towards?
-Death.
lt's funnier.
He dies of a funny heart attack.
He's a schmuck
who screwed around with our heroine...
so it won't be too sad.
Schmucks are people, too, you know.
Death doesn't seem a little harsh to you?
l just went where the story took me.
lt's a work of fiction,
just stuff that l made up.
They're ready to do the hospital
''Do you take Viagra?'' scene.
Should we wait for you?
Yeah, good. That's fine.
So l'm gonna be
the laughing stock of Broadway?
Harry, he's not you.
He's a version of the truth of you,
so to speak.
-Sorry to interrupt.
-lt's okay.
Dave wants to know,
when Henry says ''l love ya''...
you want that to be ''ya,'' not ''you,'' right?
-Right.
-Yeah.
-You look really nice.
-Thank you.
Are you feeling all right?
You know, it isn't like
l wanted to stop seeing you.
We could have carried on
a fun thing for a while.
Why is it that you broads
want all or nothing?
l don't know.
-We're just goofy when it comes to love.
-Yeah.
lf it's all right with you,
l'd like to be friends.
l'm not ready to be your friend.
How's that?
Fine. l understand.
Anyway, do you actually
buy that horseshit?
That men and women can be friends
once they've had sex?
l'm friends with my ex-husband,
but then again, we didn't just have sex.
We didn't just have sex, either.
Then what was it? l'd love to know.
Can l e-mail it to you when l figure it out?
Okay.
Just moving into another phase
with this thing.
l'm mad at you.
-l think l'm mad at you, too.
-Excellent.
Because l don't like
thinking about you so much...
and worrying about how you are...
and if l ruined your life.
-You've worried about me?
-Yes, honey.
The schmuck who deserves to die...
worries about you.
Sometimes, worrying about you
feels like a full-time job.
Doll, l'm doing great.
So you don't have to work that shift
anymore.
They want you to take a look
at the costumes for the dancing Henrys.
Are these gonna work for you?
Mr. Sanborn, back so soon?
This is it. l'm dying.
l've had 20 minutes
of severe chest pains, nausea...
shortness of breath.
My blood pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.
Give me the nitro, l didn't take Viagra.
Plug me into an EKG.
l'm taking two beta-blockers,
blood thinners, Lipitor, Procardia.
And if l were you,
l'd be pounding on my chest.
Your diagnosis, although fascinating,
was entirely incorrect.
lmpossible.
Do you realize that a severe anxiety attack
can masquerade as a heart attack?
So l'm nuts.
Perfect. The one thing
l'm not taking pills for.
lf you don't wanna end up here
every week...
l suggest you do whatever it takes
to decompress.
Now lie down.
Just try something with me, come on.
Give me your hand.
Relax.
All right, close your eyes. Okay, good.
l want you to give yourself a visual....
Both eyes.
l want you to give yourself
a visual image...
of something that gives you
a feeling of peace and serenity.
l don't know what...a hammock.
Good.
What else?
Palm trees.
Clear blue water.
What else do you see? Feel? Taste?
A peach margarita.
A Cuban cigar.
Miles...
of soft beach.
l couldn't believe you were calling
from downstairs. You have a beard.
lt's great to see you.
You couldn't look better.
Thank you. Come on in.
No, l just wanted to stop by and say hi...
and tell you that l'm sorry...
if l ever did anything to you
that wasn't on the up and up.
What do you mean? You were great to me.
-l was?
-Always.
That's refreshing. Good.
l don't know
what you've done to yourself...
but you look absolutely radiant.
l'm three months pregnant, so that
might have something to do with it.
-Really?
-Yeah.
-Who's the lucky guy?
-My husband.
Hold on,
because he really wants to meet you.
Harry Sanborn, this is my husband,
Danny Benjamin.
-Heard so much about you.
-l bet.
You know, with the play and all.
-l'm famous?
-Just to us.
ln every interview my mom does,
she always says she made you up.
So the guy in the play doesn't make it,
does he?
He basically dies
at the end of the second act.
But it gets a huge laugh.
l was hoping she'd give me a reprieve.
Yeah, well....
-Good seeing you. Congratulations.
-Thanks.
How is she?
She's really good. Up to her old tricks.
Learning ltalian,
remodeling her apartment in the city....
Now, if l wanted to see her,
how would that go over?
Only one way to find out.
Except she's out of town right now.
-Yeah? Where is she?
-Paris.
She left two days ago for her birthday.
But she'll be back next week.
Paris.
Have a good evening, sir.
Good evening, sir.
Showtime.
-l knew you'd be here.
-You did?
At first l thought l had
the wrong restaurant, but here you are.
Just like l imagined.
You mean we're not just
bumping into each other?
You came here to see me?
l'm aware it was a bold move...
one of those impulses that grabs you...
but so far we're okay. Right?
l mean, l kind of--
lt would be great
if you'd let me take that as a yes.
Would you like a glass of wine?
Yeah, l would. l'd love one.
l was just gonna give you a kiss hello.
Okay.
Awkward.
You remember how you said
if we still knew each other...
we should go to Paris for our birthdays?
-We still know each other.
-That's true.
But, Harry, l haven't heard from you
in six months.
Yeah.
After l saw you in the theater
that afternoon with the dancing Henrys....
-Yes. Sorry.
-No, it's very funny, by the way.
-l had another episode.
-l'm sorry.
As it turned out, l was fine,
but l was sure l was dying.
The doctor in the ER said
l needed to decompress.
So l did.
l walked out of there and changed my life.
Sold most of my businesses,
packed my bags...
moved to an island in the Caribbean.
That is where you've been all this time?
ln the Caribbean?
Actually, no.
l was there about six hours
when it occurred to me...
that wasting away
on an island in the Caribbean...
couldn't possibly cure what was ailing me.
So l decided to take another kind of trip...
into, let's call it my past.
Your past?
l thought if l visited
some of the women l'd known...
maybe l could figure out
how l arrived at being me.
Yeah, it was quite a journey.
Hi, Louise. You remember me?
Hi, how are....
Some of the ladies, l'll admit...
weren't too interested in seeing me
or even speaking to me.
But one day, my losing streak ended.
One of them opened up to me.
Hearing what she had to say
was no picnic...
but l stuck it out and listened.
And then l listened harder.
And one of the things l realized...
was l was actually giving closure
to generations of women.
When you hear the same story
about yourself...
over and over, your life begins to add up.
lt took me months to find them all.
Visited a dozen different states.
But l traveled the farthest to see you.
l don't believe it.
Me, either.
-Doc, how are you?
-l'm good.
-Nice to see you.
-You, too.
l should have told you he was coming...
but l was so engrossed in your story.
Sorry l'm late.
What story?
Maybe another time.
So l guess l should have seen your play.
l would have known how this ended.
-Yeah, big twist.
-Yeah.
So what are you doing over here, man?
Just a vacation.
l've never been to Paris in January.
lt's amazing to run into you.
You look good.
You do. You look great.
l haven't been on a gurney in six months,
so that's something.
-l've just been to every store in the city.
-What?
This woman is impossible to buy for,
but l think...
l finally found the right gift.
Happy birthday, baby.
l'll open it in a bit.
No, you know what?
l'm gonna let you two celebrate.
No, please. You're welcome to stay.
-Join us for dinner. We'd love to--
-l can't. Really.
Why? You have somewhere to go?
This looks amazing.
Thank you, sir. That's nice.
l've spent a lot of time in hospitals.
lt doesn't matter, right?
Make a wish.
To the forces of destiny
that brought us together tonight.
Forces of destiny.
Beautiful.
What are you doing? You don't smoke.
l'm in Paris.
Secondhand smoke will kill you anyway.
She's very brilliant,
but the woman cannot hold her liquor.
-l like that about me.
-Me, too.
Now, if l were writing this,
this is where l would write:
''An awkward moment.''
Honey, if you were writing this,
l'd be dead.
Never fails to amuse her.
Here it is, thank you.
-No, please let us.
-No.
Doc, l insist. l crashed your party.
Please let me buy you dinner
on your birthday.
Thank you.
What time does that say?
God, l have no idea.
-Wait a minute, l....
-Me, too.
You think you look so handsome in mine?
You know how long
l have been looking for those?
Yes, l do.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Once again...
closure.
-Here we are.
-Why don't you take it?
No, l think l'm gonna walk.
You two take it.
Doc, thanks for everything.
Stay well.
This was fun.
And it was so great to see you. Honest.
Bye.
lt was great to see you.
-lf you ever--
-No.
Take care of yourself, Harry.
Yeah, l will. You, too.
lt's cold.
Look who gets to be the girl.
Anything else?
Where's Julian?
He's back at the hotel.
He said when he saw me with you...
he knew that l was still in love with you.
What do you have to say about that?
lf it's true, my life just got made.
Why did you come here?
Turns out the heart attack
was easy to get over.
You were something else.
l finally get what it's all about.
l'm 63 years old...
and l'm in love...
for the first time in my life.
That's what l came here to say.
