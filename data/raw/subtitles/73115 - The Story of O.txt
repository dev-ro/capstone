STORY OF O
One day, O's lover takes her
to a place they've never gone before.
Park Monceau, Park Montsouris
somewhere around there.
They stroll along illumius roads
surrounded by dark endless forrests.
Twilight is approaching,
and autum is in the air.
Once in the car, René tells her to take
off what she's wearing under her dress.
Not knowing where they're going
she doesn't dare ask questions.
She's afraid the driver
may turn around.
Now your panties.
Your flesh and the seat
have to be touching.
You must never cross your legs,
knees open.
Well, here we are.
Now listen to me.
You must get out of the car
and ring the doorbell.
You'll follow whoever answers,
you'll have to do whatever they say.
- You will obey?
- Oh, yes.
- And you?
- I'll join you.
Go on.
Another version of the same beginning
had been more simple but more brutal.
O had been driven somewhere, by her
lover and a friend of his unkown to her.
And it was his friend, the stranger
who had explained to the young woman...
that her lover had been instructed
to prepare her.
O was very surprised
of having her hands tied,
as she had every intension
of obeying her lover.
But it was undoubtedly René's wish,
like her waiting here alone had been.
Wait here pointlessly for half an hour,
or an hour. Or two. Who could tell.
It seemed a century.
You mustn't keep your legs together,
it's forbidden.
Well now. Turn her around.
- Has she been chained?
- Not by me.
Or whipped?
If you had
it might have given her pleasure.
What we have to do
is get tears out of her.
Here, when we whip you,
you'll always be blindfolded.
Only this evening, you're permitted
to see yourself whipped.
So she's proud as well!
I want to hear her scream.
Right now!
No! Please!
No. It marks her too much.
And the whip can make the pain
last much longer.
I ask that you use only the whip.
Get me the whip.
René!
- You see I managed to stand it?
- You did well.
For you, René.
Yes, very well.
Don't try and get up, stay as you are.
Tomorrow you'll wear clothes like this.
They are very practical.
Show her why.
The women you see in the chateau
and even in the park -
- all dress in this manner.
So you remain constantly to disposition
of anyone who wishes to use you.
Anyway he wants, whenever he wants.
However, before I inform you
of the rules you will have to obey,
I want to remind you that you came here
willingly and you can still back out.
No one forced you,
and you're free to leave.
If you wish to you may go.
Don't look at me like that, we have
the means to force you to regret it.
Now for the last time,
do you wish to leave?
In that case,
you'll be told the rules which
you must obey while you're with us.
You're in the wing
that overlooks the park.
- Your valet is named Pierre.
- Valet?
It's he who chains you up to sleep
and unchains you.
And whips you when you're punished.
You know, the valets can use us.
But Pierre, he's...
You must not look at his face.
- Really? Why?
- Don't look at my face, huh?
Get her ready and I'll come back then.
The two young women,
Jeanne and Andrée, asked her name.
- Did your lover bring you here?
- Yes.
You're very lucky.
They'll be be more severe you.
- But why?
- You'll be finding out soon enough.
A so lovely lady.
O wondered why there was so much
sweetness mingled with her terror,
or why she found her terror
so delicious.
Get up.
Turn around.
Once you've eaten, if you want to,
you'll be allowed to sleep till noon.
How did you know that?
How much sugar you take?
Oh, I've been told many things.
That will do.
We're not supposed to be talking.
- Come, Andrée.
- But explain why...
My darling.
Come now, let us see you.
Obey.
O felt defiled and guilty of having found
pleasure in the arms of a stranger.
- that he felt the more he gave her
to others, the dearer she was to him.
The fact that he could, was the proof
that she belonged to him.
One can only give only
what really belongs to him.
No, don't speak.
You heard yesterday...
...that as long as you are here,
you are not to look a man in the face.
Nor speak to him.
From now on, you'll observe
that rule with me as well.
You are mine.
But before enter the world of silence,
it's important to me
you say two words, no more.
The name of the person
for whom I brought you here,
and that you'll meet soon, I swear.
Sir Stephen.
Sir Stephen.
Sir Stephen.
It's the enclosure.
What's that?
I didn't say anything!
I swear it! No, I beg your pardon!
Forgive me, please!
Please! I'm sorry!
No! I beg of you! Do whatever
you want to me but not that!
Please! I'll do anything for you,
anything you want! But not that!
Had Jeanne broken some rule
by speaking of the enclosure?
And where was the enclosure?
O never found out.
Monique, come here.
Come here!
I'm leaving. And I wont be coming
back here till I come to get you.
- How soon?
- Not to long.
- How many days?
- Now if you want.
They whipped me and you looked on.
I wanted to, when I'm away I can
imagine seeing it all again.
You will like that?
I will.
It's difficult to understand me.
I wasn't supposed to speak to you.
Or look at you either.
Look at me.
I told you it's difficult understanding
me. But you seem to have, right?
Yes.
In what way?
A little girl once walked in a field...
when she passed a huge white
rabbit carrying a watch.
Her name was Alice.
The rabbit said they we're late
and should hurry.
It might have surprised
a lot of people, but not Alice.
And so?
So she goes with him.
What does she find?
She falls in a deep well.
She's not hurt by the fall.
And she has many adventures.
Continue.
Who else does she meet?
Sir Stephen.
My hands.
I love you. I love you.
She won't look up.
She will.
No, she will never look at you.
You're excited because she's new here.
She's proud.
That sets me... on fire.
Let her be, Pierre.
Pierre is starring at you.
You look embarrassed?
Yes.
You like Pierre?
Unbelievable.
What she couldn't believe, was that...
O loved everything that came
from her lover, even Pierre.
It was her lover who possessed her
through these strangers...
to whom he had surrendered her.
I've got to prepare you.
You won't be dining
with the others tonight.
Would you wait outside
for a little while?
What for?
Because I'm used to a door
in a bathroom.
The Masters don't permit doors.
Look at me.
Look at me just once
and I wont beat you again.
I'll only pretend to.
Did I take you by force
in the staircase?
O lost all track of time.
The grass became black.
Day was nolonger day.
Nor was the night, night.
The lights we're never extinguished.
And then, after days,
time stopped being motionless.
In that velvet night,
her chains we're removed.
I've come back.
We must go.
Take it, wear it on your index finger.
It should fit you.
Goodbye.
It fits well.
Roissy.
Like that, right.
Move your head to the left.
Now trow your head back. That's good!
Swing it around.
That's fine. Keep it going. Come on.
Perfect! Yeah, keep it going!
Move your haed, go on. Again.
Start moving, like that, that's good.
Go on like that. Keep it up.
You're doing great.
We're gonna keep on going.
Just hold that a minute now.
You're doing just fine.
Good. That's nice.
More wind, more wind.
That's good, that's great!
That was beautiful!
Okay, that's fine. That'll be it.
Will you make some copies for me?
Of course I will, I promised.
You look so virginal and pure.
It's fantastic how you've changed
since you got back.
But those garters...
they're bad for the circulation,
why wear them?
They're practical.
O made about fifty photographs
of Jacqueline,
none of which we're anything
like what she'd taken before.
She had never captured such a provocative
quality in a face or a body untill now.
René, darling.
Look I have to leave immediately.
But I'll be back in an hour.
You have one hour
to make yourself beautiful.
A chauffeur will come and pick you up.
And you must be all dressed in black.
And you better wear your fur coat.
It's terribly old my fur coat!
Now a days it's very chic.
Come on, you do understand?
Very chick, like a widow.
Please,
it's very important to me.
Okay.
You look lovely, my dear.
I want to present, Sir Stephen.
René didn't lie to me.
A dry Martini, please.
- That's what you like, isn't it?
- Thank you.
Sit down.
If you agree, we'll dine
downstairs, it's more pleasant.
And then we'll take coffee at home.
Sit on the sofa.
René will pour coffee.
I don't know if René has spoken
to you about his family.
Long before he was born,
I was brought up by his mother.
Untill the day she
abandoned my father.
We are therefor unrelated.
But if you wish, in certain fashion,
we're brothers.
And all along we've shared everything.
In principal, the ring you're wearing
gives me a right to you.
Just like anybody else
who knows it's meaning.
However, that implies a temporary bond.
What we expect
is something more lasting.
If you accept, I'll tell you of
Sir Stephen's preferences.
My dear René,
not preferences. Demands.
Since I belong to René
I'll do what he wants.
No, you belong to both of us.
You must say:
"I belong to both of you."
"I'll be whatever both of you
want me to be."
I want to hear from your lips
that you consent to belong to me,
as totally as you belong to René.
You'll continue
to have only one master,
a most exacting one.
Because I have a
preference for rituals.
I think you'll learn quite a lot.
Well?
Both of you, get out!
No!
I accept.
Do your demands include whipping me?
Sometimes.
The two men discussed her body
in the crudest and most obscene terms.
She felt emerged in shame.
But beyond her shame
she felt as one does in the night,
in the grip of a dream which one
recognizes as having begun again.
I leave you now to Sir Stephen.
Stay as you are. He'll send you
back home when it suits him.
I'll see you out.
Thank you, René.
Will you take the car?
You longed for the dream to stop,
because of the fear
of being unable to bear it.
And yet you want it to go on
in order to know how it will end.
Turn around.
- Would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you.
I wish to see you naked.
Slip the dress of your shoulders.
You'll make-up these darker.
When I see you again.
Undress now.
You are easy.
Does René realize you want every
man who desires you?
He gives you an alibi,
for your sensuality.
It's a lie! I love René.
You love René.
But you're an easy conquest. Stay!
Caress yourself.
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know very well what I mean.
Play with yourself.
No, I can't! I can't!
Is that that how you obey?
I'm afraid René has trained
you very badly.
I always obey René.
You're confuse love
with obedience.
You will obey me without loving me
and without my loving you.
My room is next to yours.
Good night.
Just a second.
You left this.
Keep it. It's made of iron
like your ring. Iron suits you.
Or should I say irons suits you.
Please!
You musn't tell René I disobeyed.
I shall obey you, I swear.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
The chauffeur will take you back
when you're ready.
The Master has a message for you.
René telephoned to say he'll be by to
pick you up at the studio this evening.
The whip is for your next visit.
Okay, that's enough.
That's something that holder,
you're a femme fatale.
For who I wonder.
She should have liked to think:
"For Sir Stephen".
But she was afraid.
Afraid of he might have told René.
Afraid because René had not come.
If Sir Stephen didn't love her,
René would stop loving her.
Of that she was sure.
You've seen Sir Stephen?
We talked.
Look at that!
He gave it to you?
He did?
I'm proud of you! You are marvellous!
That makes two of us who thinks so.
I wanted to know
if you had developed my photos.
I'm so sorry, I haven't had the time.
Okay, sorry, just wanted to know.
- No, don't leave.
- No, come on back.
Well, all right then.
After that, Jacqueline
spent a lot of time with them.
René enjoyed it, he found her,
beautiful and no doubt wanted her.
A short time ago
O would have been jealous.
but she was too
preoccupied by something else.
The ever increasing hold
Sir Stephen had over her lover.
What are you angry about?
You're being foolish.
I'm not angry.
But I never see you!
You never touch me anymore.
And when you do get around to it,
it's to prove your lord and master
has left his sign.
It's him you love, not me.
Don't be childish!
There's the proof! Had I said that a
while ago you'd have gotten furious,
You would have hit me so hard
I wouldn't dare to answer.
I belong to you René. I swear!
First you belong to Sir Stephen!
- Listen to what...
- No!
I see it all now.
Phone him, tell him it's impossible
tonight, that I'll go tomorrow.
Invent a reason why.
But tonight I want to be with you.
That's out of the question.
And I'm going to tell him
every word you said tonight.
She didn't believe he would do it.
But he took her to Sir Stephens house,
and stayed only long enough to betray her.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you, René.
Seeing him as pale as she was herself,
O could almost believe, that
he had begun to love her.
And then too.
He'd never kissed her before.
But he punished her
for her disobidience that night.
So cruely, that
she lost consciousness.
- Is that you?
- Wasn't it me you we're calling?
I'm not quite sure about a decision
I have to make. I can't do alone.
I ran in to Pierre, the valet.
- And where does he want to take you?
- To a hotel or something.
Would you like to go with him?
Well, yes I would.
Take a taxi and go straight home.
Don't you want to see me?
I want you to obey me, that's all.
Is that you, René?
René had a key made for me.
I see you obeyed me.
You're a big girl, now.
So I invite you for lunch.
But first, I would like you to answer
some questions.
Sit down.
After you returned from Roissy,
have you belonged to any man
other than René and myself?
No.
Have you wished to belong to any man?
Except for Pierre, evidently.
A girl, maybe?
Is it a girl you desire?
I'll show you.
So this is the Jacqueline
whom René told me about?
And you desire her...
Jacqueline's life is really incredible,
I must say it's really marvelous...
Sir Stephen was making her talk
about Jacqueline.
But was he listening?
She felt with delight that he was
only aware of the sound of her voice...
and the movements of  her lips.
Thank you.
The things I will tell you I've already
discussed with René.
Can you remember the first evening
you came to my home?
I gave you an order
you didn't obey.
Would you obey me now?
Oh, yes. And whenever you like.
Drink your coffee.
You also realize that nobody,
not even René,
has taken you in front of me.
That does not mean that...
somebody, a man who doesn't
love you, will not take you,
in front of the man who does.
He spoke for a long time,
but she was nolonger listening.
She was to remember only
those few words:
"the man who does love you".
What other confession did she need.
You're not listening to me.
I'll do whatever you ask of me.
I'm yours.
Are you?
Absolutely. And René's.
René accepts you belong to me,
I've asked him to.
And if you agree,
I want more than just words.
If you agree to be mine as you say,
then you will accept a definitive mark.
- A mark?
- A permanent one.
Finish your coffee.
Nothing will be
inflicted on you by force.
You can always refuse.
You can leave.
In any case, you have time to decide.
The time needed for
Jacqueline to surrender.
Jacqueline? But why?
I could answer like so many lovers
that I wish to see you with a woman.
But it wouldn't be the real reason.
If I want Jacqueline to be yours,
it's because you would have to
take her to Roissy.
Absolutely impossible!
You can do it.
No, it's impossible.
I don't want to be in Renés debt.
So when she leaves Roissy
we'll bring her to him.
To René?
He's in love with her?
In love with Jacqueline?
Well is he?
He wants her. She doesn't want him.
So to begin with, find a way
to make her share your apartment.
No, don't.
If the closet's too small here
there's another one downstairs.
It's all yours.
René doesn't care
that I'm taking his room?
But not at all. He's overjoyed.
You see? You just had to invite her.
That doesn't mean anything.
Sir Stephen was right.
If she gives herself
to anyone it's you.
Good night.
Come and say good night here.
Sit down and talk a minute.
Are you sure René will come back?
No, not tonight.
What have you done to your hair?
Let it down.
That's better.
You're beautiful.
Say it's what you want.
I want to.
It went very well.
I'll tell you about it.
What?
You mean now?
Rightaway.
- René?
- No, it wasn't René.
- Are you so happy on our account?
- No.
In fact, yes.
It is on account of us.
You better hurry, it's getting late.
Wont you kiss me?
No.
- See you tonight.
- Okay.
When O came to Stephen's house,
Norah took her upstairs.
First to undress then prepare her.
O never got used to being naked
in front of the woman
who never spoke to her
and hardly looked at her.
But this time she was lead directly
to Sir Stephen,
waiting for her in a room
she had never seen before.
Well, I did it!
I was quite sure you would
manage all right.
Let's take this off.
- I'll tell you how it turned out.
- No, let me tell you.
And you can correct me
if I make a mistake.
You're looking very beautiful today.
I know how it was with Jacqueline,
- You undid her dress.
- Yes.
You took off her belt.
And you talked to her all the time
as you looked into her eyes.
He made no mistake.
Without knowing Jacqueline,
except from her photograps,
he knew that she loved pleasure.
And that she would give herself all
the more easily to O,
that she found it safe and agreeable
to be given pleasure by a woman.
Roses... for a man?
Why not?
When I love you.
Norah!
Norah!
Take these, they're for you!
You spoke of
marking me the other day.
- You accept it?
- I'm here am I not?
Soon.
We're going to mark her in a few days.
I presume you will be present.
Yes.
Come I'll show you
all around the house.
This will be your room during
your stay with us, pleasant?
Very nice.
Take your clothes off and
let me see you.
Lovely.
While you're here
I shall give you a corset.
Very tight. Every day we will
make it a little tighter on you...
so that your waist
will be even narrower.
Take off your stockings too.
Those garters are a bad idea.
Who made you do that?
The boy who gave her to me.
René, you've met him.
Kneel down.
Do you agree to accept freely...
to bear the goldrings
and the initials of Sir Stephen...
in any way
we place them on you body?
I will, yes.
I'll show our friend out if I may.
You wait, all right?
You're really mine that way.
O, here's company.
Yvonne, Claire,
- Andrée...
- We know eachother.
- And Thérese.
- So de we.
We we're buddies in the army!
All right, Thérese. Just calm down.
Yvonne,
put this on her, please.
- Help her, Andrée
- Of course.
- It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you.
Lace it up for her.
It's tight, it's terrible.
You'll see how lovely you will be.
Overhere now.
Have you been beaten recently?
Two or three weeks ago.
You will not be beaten here.
Only this once.
For your arrival.
At Anne-Marie's O rediscovered
a way of life...
...that took her back
to her childhood.
I warn you, I'm a bad loser.
Well, but I'm check mating you there.
- I'm not going to play!
- Now, now. What's the matter here?
She's a cheat!
You're a big lier.
You bet you are! She played fair.
Now you'll all stand around me.
Except for you, O.
We're going to draw a lots
to see who will whip you.
Ready everybody?
Then here we go.
Who has the queen?
You didn't do it on purpose?
It just came out that way.
You know better.
Go ahead. Take her away.
You can cry all you like
since nobody can hear.
And if you get too loud...
I can always drown out your voice.
All right, Yvonne.
Faster and harder.
I want her to scream!
She had come to understand
that her feelings for René,
the stay at the chateau,
the ordeals she had gone through,
were nothing but faiths way
of leading her to the man she loved.
- Who do you think about?
- Stephen.
And she told herself...
that if she was strong enough
to bear it to the end...
everything would be given her.
She would finally have conquered him.
I've asked Claire because there's
something she has to show you.
- Will you please, dear?
- Why of course.
Sir Stephen has informed me
that he wants you to wear rings...
like those you just saw,
with his name on them.
Once they're on,
it's impossible to remove them.
Will they hurt me?
No worse than having
your ears pierced.
Unfortunately for you that's not all.
You might foolishly
try to have the rings removed.
That's why Sir Stephen would like you
to be marked in another fashion.
A truly permanent one.
What mark do you mean?
You promised not to ask that.
On the last day I will tell you.
Today it is your turn.
Well, pick it up.
But we didn't draw lots yet.
I have decided
that you must do it once.
Obey.
But I can't beat her.
Well, she whipped you.
Punish her now for that.
It's about time you learn.
Sir Stephen mentioned
a certain Jacqueline.
You'll have to whip her some day.
Go ahead.
And don't hold back.
Or you will be whipped yourself for it.
Harder!
Enough!
Forgive me.
Pardon me.
You must I didn't mean it.
- Is she asleep?
- She is.
- She loves you.
- No.
She loves you, I can tell.
How did you make love to her?
I've gotta know everything.
Tell me everything!
You're smart aren't you?
So smart.
You know what they're
gonna do with you?
They're gonna brand you
with a hot iron.
Sir Stephen's arrived.
Thanks, Andreé.
I may be leaving,
you wont see me anymore.
What will you bet?
This.
O. You may still refuse.
No.
- Shall I tie your hands?
- No.
Don't touch me.
I don't want to stay here!
I know I couldn't bear it!
- I want to go home!
- Then you may.
Sir Stephen's chauffeur
will drive you to Paris.
It was a golden afternoon
when he told her that he loved her...
and also that he would give her
to others who did not love her.
Would he do it?
And what did he want to prove by it?
- Thank you.
- Thanks very much.
I think I prefer you without the hat.
Wait a second.
It looks better on you.
- Your daughter is very kind.
- That's right, she is.
Would you also like
to be my daughter?
Anything at all.
Would you hand me my robe?
What on earth are those rings?
I'm surprised, it's the first time
you've notice something...
besides your beautiful self.
Why are you wearing them?
- Would you really like to know?
- Yes.
- You really would like to know?
- Yes.
I belong completly to Sir Stephen.
And to nobody else.
It's incredible!
Totally incredible!
Are you dreaming or what?
It's unheard of.
Sir Stephen,
René,
Anne-Marie!
Me.
Unimaginable!
In your story there's a person
I really don't like.
I mean that girl
who beat you so hard.
Admit you invented that girl.
No there's nothing invented at all.
What if I wanted to go to Roissy?
For me, why?
To see what it was like.
Just to see.
Only if nothing happend.
They wont allow a tourist.
I'll even make love to René,
I'll do it.
That's what you want.
You musn't yet.
Stephen come to Brittany,
I'll organize a great party...
in O's honour.
It's agreed.
Come closer.
Turn around.
A brand!
Splendid.
Would you like to see, lvan?
That's all right.
Take it away.
Must you go Stephen?
Yes, I must.
Then Ivan took O to a hotel and
kept her there until the evening.
O's submissiveness...
and the marks which he had seen
on her body touched Ivan profoundly.
But above all he recieved from her
freely and naturally...
all that he had never yet
dared to ask of any woman!
The Master's in the garden.
Anything the matter?
I want to tell you something.
Long before I met you.
I promised myself that,
no woman would ever mean to me...
more than a pebble
picked up on a shore.
But you, my darling, you would go
with me as far as I wish you to go.
But Stephen, I didn't know
what love was before we met.
You may put me through any test.
And I'll come through.
What do you look so sad for?
Ivan has fallen madly
in love with you.
He came around this morning
and begged me to set you free.
He told me he wanted to marry you.
He wants to save you.
You know I treat you as I do,
because you're mine.
And as long as you're mine, you are
not free to refuse my commands.
But you are always free to chose
if you're mine or not.
I explained this to Ivan
and he's coming at three.
But you're mad, both of you.
If Ivan weren't coming,
what plans had you made for me?
I wanted to... I'll show you.
It's just like Anne-Marie's house!
There's a degree of childishness in
everything we hold close to the heart.
It's really an exact copy!
But when did you have this done?
After your return.
I've been waiting for the right time.
I didn't want to show it to you
untill I'd given you to others.
But you've done nothing
I can punish you for yet.
Poor boy.
He must learn the realities.
And this is the way.
I must see Norah for half an hour.
Norah! Norah!
Norah!
Sir Stephen's expecting me.
He's waiting upstairs, sir.
Sir Stephen decided
to take O to Brittany
to attend the commandeur's party.
He invited
Jacqueline and René as well.
Jacqueline, hurry up.
I'm coming.
Hey, wait for me!
It's marvellous!
The beach, the sky... being with you.
Hey, what are you doing with that?
Would you like to be
a pebble on a beach?
Yes, if picked up by you.
That way I'd always
stay with you in your pocket.
I'm delighted to se you again.
I don't know if it's the fresh air
but you're lovlier than ever.
The commandeur is organizing
a party on his boat tonight.
He's brought things
for you to choose from.
- No, thank you.
- Thank you.
But on the other hand
Bali it quite different.
There, everything is in the same dish.
How long were you there?
It's fascinating.
I would have liked to show it to you.
You must have met
some fascinating people.
- Yes, especially touring around.
- I envy you.
O could feel René's
terrible desire for Jacqueline,
and the suffering
that this love caused him.
- But I'm sure you've heard enough.
- No go on.
I don't want to bore you. But I met
a young lady at a point.
- Was she beautiful, more than I?
- Different, she was attractive.
Seeing René this way,
he who had always been so careful,
O was neither sad nor jealous.
But she felt a new wave
of resentment towards  Jacqueline.
O can get Jacqueline
to give herself to you.
But you'd only have her
a night or two.
And that wont mean much.
O is right, she must be persuaded
to go to Roissy.
And if she doesn't want
to go along with it?
You've always
had confidence in me, René.
Jacqueline will be handed to you
the way I have decided.
That is how O was handed to me.
But you don't owe me anything.
I do.
I love her.
And it's all due to you.
My obligation to you is increasing.
Come in.
What do you want?
About this afternoon.
I only did it because I was jealous.
I can't bear you not speaking anymore.
You wont look at me.
I'll do whatever you want
I swear it.
Or I'll kill myself!
I could learn to be like the others.
Help me to learn.
The others have been to Roissy.
And that's where they learned.
Then I'll go to Roissy.
Take me there with you.
Having accomplished the mission
Sir Stephen had assigned her,
O chose a mask,
seeing herself as a bird of prey,
a bird carefully trained to retrieve
her victim and bring it to her master.
I regret this, O.
I'd like to cancel, but it's too late.
Because of the other guests the
commandeur would never forgive me...
for not keeping my word.
Don't regret anything.
I'm yours
and the whole world may know.
Can't you guess what I feel?
I'm proud of what I am!
Was she made of stone? Of wax?
Or was she a creature
from another world?
Sir Stephen watched O triumphant
in her insolent nudity
and was enthrolled
by the measure of his power.
Some days later,
O drove Jacqueline to Roissy.
See you inside?
You go ahead, I'll follow.
And a few days later,
I drove Jacqueline to Roissy.
And Jacqueline asked me:
"See you inside?"
And she stopped.
So I said: "Go ahead, I'll follow."
And she did go?
Well yes.
I love you.
Why do you smile?
You say to me you love me.
But just say I demanded...
that you bear as I did, only a few
of the same punishments...
You would accept it, wouldn't you?
I believe so.
But one of the things in life
that a man in love learns is--
The end.
