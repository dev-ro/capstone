Terri !
You cIean up
the tub ring?
I'm still in here,
UncIe James.
Did you?
Last night you said
you'd cIean it up.
l can't clean it
because l'm still
in here, okay?
You'll be late
for school, Terri.
Do you want me to go
to school or do you want me
to clean the tub,
because l can't do both.
l'm hungry.
You cook us up
some steaks.
No. Those are
for dinner, okay?
How about l make us
some beans on toast?
How's that sound?
Hey, guys, come on.
Let's go.
Why didn't you
pass it to me?
Go.
All right.
Yeah, wait up.
Zach, wait up!
Hey, slow down !
For aII you peopIe who
want to bIame the camera
for your bad yearbook picture,
recent freshman's shot.
But don't Iook
for us, though.
Because we naiIed
our pictures!
Yeah! I know I did!
UntiI tomorrow, peace!
Peace!
Peace.
All right,
people, l got a couple
of announcements to make.
Want to remind you
that those large, round,
metal receptacles
you see around campus?
They're for trash.
Use them.
Hey!
National Honor Society essays
and applications deadline
is next Wednesday.
You can give them to me,
or there's
a designated box. . .
Yo.
. . .in the main office.
Trash heap.
You know this?
The Pioneers will be playing
three away games this month
and the team needs drivers.
You know this.
Shit is old school.
And if anyone's parent
can volunteer,
please have them contact. . .
Old school?
Hip-hop.
Go Pioneers!
Rappers get all the pussy.
We're instituting
a no-tolerance policy. . .
. . .against cell phones.
Okay.
lf you're found texting or. . .
Yes, Terri.
May l go to the restroom,
please?
You just got here.
Absolutely not.
lf you're found texting
or using your phone
in class,
phone will be confiscated
and returned to you at
the end of the school day.
You may use the phone
during nutrition and lunch.
You know about
eating pussy, right?
The library
will be closed
intermittently next week
while construction's going on.
And if your study hall
is being relocated,
there will be a notice
posted by the door.
Why are you
doing this?
We're all aware
of the false. . .
Players be choking
to death on the pussy.
. . .disruptions to
the entire school,
as well as. . .
Okay, l get it. Okay?
Do not take it
lightly and, then, the
authorities will not either.
You know about
eating butt holes, right?
- l said l get it!
- Terri !
Chill out, titty-balls. Damn !
Titty-balls.
. . .has reminded
me to ask you not to leave
food in your lockers.
Mr. Ribis,
l see you brought
a hat to school today.
Yes, l did, sir.
You know that
l collect hats.
l have a large collection.
lf you would like your hat
to stay yours and not mine,
l suggest you put it
in your backpack
and keep it there.
Go to class, Mr. Ribis.
You got it,
Mr. Fitzgerald.
We have mice
in the attic.
We have to do
something about this.
We have valuable
documents up there.
Feeling better,
Uncle James?
Up and down.
l'm gonna go to the market
and get some traps
and some cheddar.
You can set
the traps tonight
before bedtime, okay?
l don't want to do that,
Uncle James.
Well, if l set them,
l'll forget to check.
l can remind you.
No, Terri.
You have no chores.
You have no one
breathing down
your neck.
l mean, you live
a prince's life here.
You know that.
l know.
Good.
l'm gonna set up the ladder
next to the crawl space.
I want to taIk to you
about my boyfriend.
Well,
I don't want to
taIk to you.
Oh, you tango divine!
l don't know
if you have heard,
but there's going
to come a time...
How did
we do up there?
Terri?
Five mice!
That's not bad.
Well, we'll put them
in the marsh.
Let the other animals
pick them off.
Just think of it as
feeding the animals, Terri.
l'm hurrying as fast as l can.
l just really don't want
- Mrs. Vick to. . .
- All right, class.
Now today
we're going to learn
how to crack an egg.
Do you know how
to crack an egg?
No.
l'm sure you think you do,
but there is a special way.
Now what you do is,
one, two, three, crack.
lt's all in the wrist.
One, two, three, crack.
Wrist.
lt's so easy and a way. . .
l just
want to be with you.
This is just
the perfect moment.
All right, come on, come on.
l know you guys
think you'll never lose
your memory,
but believe me, you will.
One, two, three, crack.
Ms. Hamish,
pIease send Terri Thompson in.
Terri Thompson.
l had hoped we wouldn't
have to meet like this.
ln fact, l was sure
we wouldn't have to.
Do you know
all the students' names?
No, it wouldn't be
possible for me to know
all the students' names.
No.
Why do you. . .
l mean,
how do you know mine?
Well, every year
there's two groups of kids,
who stand out here.
Okay?
There's the
good-hearted kids.
And there's
the bad-hearted kids.
And those are the ones
whose names l learn.
And which one am l?
Don't you know, dude?
l don't know if l know.
Well, you strike me as one of
the good-hearted ones, Terri,
which is why l'm upset
that we have to meet
here today,
for reasons
of discipline.
Sit down, Markson !
Sit down !
ln the chair!
There's something wrong
with that kid.
ls he one of
the bad hearts?
No. With him,
we're dealing with
a third category.
As yet,
unnamed and unknowable.
Where were we?
You were getting mad at me
about my tardies.
No. Um. . .
Listen, you want
a Malt Ball?
Yeah. Thank you.
l'm not mad, but
we have a real problem here
on our hands,
and l'm for
dealing with it head-on.
What do you think
about that?
Okay.
Good.
Well, what's the deal?
Your grades are dropping.
Your teachers are
telling me you won't
participate in the lessons,
you've begun to wear
pajamas every day.
Do you understand,
from my perspective,
how those things could be
categorized as red flags?
They're just
comfortable on me.
Why are you late
to school every day, Terri?
lt's getting harder
to be able. . .
Okay.
Okay.
Stop right there.
You all right there,
Ms. Hamish?
Fine.
You're just clearing out
the old pipes, huh?
Dynamite.
Listen, do me a favor.
Set aside my Monday mornings
for Terri Thompson.
Terri Thomp...
Thomp... Thomp...
And if you could also let
Mrs. Davidson know
that Terri is mine
on Monday mornings, please.
All right?
T-H-O-M...
So here's what
l'm proposing.
We meet once a week
and check in with each other.
See how we're faring
against the world.
You know what l mean?
Really?
What is weird about
two guys sitting down,
sharing snacks and
shooting the breeze?
Nothing, l guess.
Nothing is right, dude.
And by the way,
you get out of homeroom
at the beginning of
each week.
Come on !
Are you kidding me?
Up high !
Fitzy needs a high five.
All the traps were
empty this morning.
That's very good, Terri.
We won't be seeing
those boys anymore,
will we?
No, l think
they'll come back,
probably next week.
l bet they'll come back.
Mmm.
l don't think so.
Once you dispatch
that front line,
the troops always fall back
for safer ground.
You know, they got
to find their food
in the woods like before.
You got plans
for the weekend?
A hummingbird in fIight
has the highest metaboIism
of aII animaIs
with the exception
of insects,
which is necessary
to support the rapid
beating of their wings.
Incubation can Iast
two to three weeks.
After hatching...
What's this about
cheddar cheese?
When did you start
liking that?
l don't understand.
l need you
to explain this to me.
You enjoyed
hurting these animals,
is that it?
l don't know.
Well, l'm so ashamed.
l didn't even know
you were capable of
doing something so ugly.
lt's like l went crazy
or something.
l've never done
anything like that before.
lt's bloodlust, dude.
lt can be a hard habit
to break, they say, once
you get started in on it.
l think l'm going to
become a vegetarian.
Whoa.
Wait a minute now.
Let's not get carried away.
l mean, you are remorseful.
And that's a positive.
l knew a kid growing up
that used to tie flaming
tennis balls to cats' tails,
and loved
every minute of it.
Apparently,
he's a cop now.
Anyway, the thing about
this mouse scenario is
even if your uncle says
he doesn't understand
why you did it,
guess what, he does.
He does and so do l.
All right?
Now, that's not to say
that it's not wrong or weird
because, believe me, it is.
But it's important for you
to get that we get it, okay?
We get it!
Right?
Open your legs. Okay?
What the hell
is your problem?
You promised me.
Open your damn legs.
Terri, can you do
the French toast?
Hello, Earth to Terri.
What?
You're on
French toast, okay?
Yeah, sure.
Oh, my God.
What, Terri?
What? What?
Guys.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Seriously?
l can't believe
they're doing that in class.
Oh, my God.
ln class. ln class.
So gross.
Hey, guys,
come over here.
Do you see that?
Right below the desk.
You stud.
ls he so desperate
to get some?
l'd say.
Damn, dude.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God !
What is it?
Tell me what it is.
Come here.
ls it true?
ls it true?
Yeah. Yeah, here.
lt's true.
lt's true!
Watch the finger.
l'm sorry.
Let me see it again !
Let me see it again !
Watch it! Watch it!
Come on,
use your traps.
That's it. All right.
l got a nose down here,
so don't. . .
Don't kick back. Push !
Hey!
Mr. Thompson,
we've been waiting for you.
l'm sorry, Mr. Flemisch.
There was a hold-up
last period.
A what? A hold-up?
What do you mean,
like a robbery?
Like a bandido-esque. . .
You know,
let me ask you something.
This is something
that's been bothering me
for quite a while now.
Why do you bear so blatant
a grudge towards physical
education and wellness?
Hey, Mr. Flemisch.
l don't think grudge
is the right word.
Oh, l'm sorry.
Well, let's get it
right, then.
How do you feel
about physical education
and wellness, Terri? Hmm?
The feeling is no feeling.
All right, Terri.
Well, l got some
news for you.
After warm-ups today,
we're going to start
working on the high jumps.
Now, will you or
will you not participate?
And l encourage you to
think before you answer.
l will not.
Well, then you get
out of my gymnasium
and don't come back!
Shit!
Ms. Miles!
Mr. Ribis,
you are in deep doo-doo!
No, l'm not mad.
l am furious!
l am disappointed
because l just lost
two average students.
This kind of thing
is punishable by law!
What's wrong, Marcus?
Are you out of your mind?
Those guys got in trouble
and it made my meeting stop.
Don't worry, Marcus.
You'll be back in there soon.
l don't know how much more
these two lovebirds can take.
Do you meet with
Mr. Fitzgerald
every Monday?
Who all comes
into these meetings,
Ms. Hamish?
Well, let's see.
On Mondays,
there's you and Marcus.
And on Tuesdays,
Amber Zane.
Amber Zane?
That's right.
And on Wednesdays,
there's that little boy
in the wheelchair.
l can never
remember his name.
Donny Washburn.
Oh ! Donny.
That's right.
And on Fridays,
there's Chad Markson.
lt's quite a group.
Terri? What's up, dude?
You all right?
Good hearts my ass!
Fuck.
Nice pajamas, man.
Uncle James?
Are you okay?
Terri,
what are you doing here?
Did you take
too many pills?
l just need to be
near some bodies.
Come on,
let's get you home.
Okay.
Terri?
Check it out.
Double D's got
a shit slip.
People, hush !
Terri, go.
What did you do?
l cut school yesterday.
Donny, wait out here
one second, will you?
- Hey, dudes.
- Hey, Donny.
You already done in there?
We're taking five
so he can see you guys.
Why are you
wearing sunglasses?
What? Oh.
These things?
Seriously, what do you
guys do in there,
play volleyball?
Cool Breeze Club.
Members only.
Get your butt in here!
Right now!
Uh-oh ! Watch out.
What is it with you?
lt's always something,
isn't it?
What did he do?
Do you know?
lt's bad, dude.
He's not too happy
with you ditching
either, Terri.
You're off the creek, pal,
and that's three detentions.
Count them,
one, two, three.
Now, get out of here.
Geez!
Mr. Thompson,
we've got a problem !
Get in here.
Close the door.
- Have a seat.
- Here it comes.
What can you be thinking?
The school is not
a country club.
Heads up.
l'm not
really mad at you, okay?
Just go along with me,
all right?
Not an option
for you to be coming in here
and try to do
that kind of thing
in my school !
Sorry, Ter.
That was a little show
for old Ms. Hamish out there.
She loves it when
l lay into you kids.
lt's keeping her going.
You yelled and screamed
at me for her?
Sounds bad, l know.
Yeah. Um. . .
The thing is
she's not doing so hot.
Truth is she's dying.
She's dying now?
Not this second, no,
but soon.
What is she dying of?
She's dying of cigarettes.
Okay? She's dying of death.
Was it all a joke
with Chad Markson, too?
No, dude.
lt's always
something with that kid,
and today he outdid himself.
l will show you
in pictograph form
what l'm talking about.
This is what he said
to Mr. Flemisch in front
of the entire class today.
Yeah. Yeah,
he's a tough one.
Very smart and very angry.
But, Terri, l didn't
call you in here today
to talk about Chad, did l?
No.
l called you in to
talk about what you said
in the hallway there.
l was mad.
And l don't blame you, dude.
But l think you
misunderstood the facts.
What's to misunderstand?
l'm a part of a group
of monsters, you know?
l'm going to
show you something,
and it's something
that l've never shown to
any other student, okay?
Come on, Terri.
There's something in there
l think might help.
Do you recognize that guy?
Cute little baby,
happy baby.
Simpler times, right?
Moving right along.
And what could go wrong?
lt's a Shangri-La.
Boom.
Now, whenever l'm
down or depressed,
l take a look at that
and it clears me right up.
This picture makes you
feel better?
Of course.
Because you see, Terri,
l thought l was
a monster, too.
And believe me
when l tell you,
l was treated like one.
l like this person.
l look forward to these days
and l look forward to my life.
Do you understand
what l'm saying to you?
Mr. Fitzgerald,
you were treated
like a monster because
you were a monster.
Wait a second.
l'm treated like a monster
because that's what
l am to them.
Terri.
This morning,
they asked me
if l suck on
my own breasts.
Mr. Fitzgerald?
Are you okay?
l'm just tired.
You know, sometimes l think
l should just leave you kids
on your own.
The way these
other kids treat you,
maybe that's preparation
for the real world.
l'm just trying
to help you, right?
l'm just trying to
give you some help, Terri.
l guess l just wish
l didn't need help,
you know?
Coming at you.
So, what about
the ditching?
Don't worry about it.
l mean, l already
yelled at you, right?
Am l right?
You were so freaking scared.
l wasn't that scared.
Oh, dude,
you were scared.
Heather MiIes and parent
to see you, Mr. FitzgeraId.
Thank you, Ms. Hamish.
Just ask them to have
a seat, please.
We're just about
finishing up here.
What are you
going to do with her?
What can l do?
Ribis is out.
lt wouldn't be right
if she got to stay on.
Where will she go?
She will transfer
to Hollyfield,
l would imagine,
like Ribis did.
All right, Terri,
we will see you
next week, yeah?
Okay, Heather, Mrs. Miles,
if you could join me here?
Have a seat.
Could you tell
Mr. Fitzgerald that l need
to see him right away?
What?
Tell him it's an emergency.
Mr. Fitzgerald,
Terri Thompson says
he wants to see you.
He says
it's an emergency.
Dude, l have
an important conference here.
What is up?
l know, sorry.
lt's about Heather.
What about her?
Terri, l'm in the middle
of a. . .
lt just seemed to me
like Dirty Zach was
making her, you know?
That is not
what l heard.
lt's my understanding
she was a willing
participant.
Maybe once they got started,
but l saw it from
the beginning,
she was shaking her head
and holding him off.
l'm telling you,
she didn't want
to do it.
You can't kick
somebody out of school
for something that
they didn't want to do,
Mr. Fitzgerald.
Terri, can l ask
where this is coming from?
This sudden concern?
What do you mean?
All l know is that
she didn't want to do it.
That's the truth.
No bull.
Okay.
Chad?
Just wanted to come over
and see what you're
doing today, okay?
Oh !
Everything all right?
Best ever.
Thanks, Uncle James.
Yeah, it's great.
Thanks.
Where's your mom?
l don't know.
Where's your dad?
l don't know.
You don't like the beans?
l like the beans, Terri.
l'm glad you're
having a good time.
This is super fun.
I'm Joe HoIIywood
and I can make you
and I can break you.
So, don't forget to IM me
because I'm hemorrhaging
money here and the 1 01 's
a freaking parking Iot.
The humane thing to do would
be to take the set outside
and put it out of its misery.
I might have
mastered Iife.
Yeah, baby.
Joe HoIIywood.
So, what did Fitzgerald
give you for ditching?
Uh, he was. . .
He was. . .
He was pretty mad.
Yeah, he was mad.
He was mad.
He's a weird dude.
Half the time,
l think he wants to hit me,
the other half,
l'm scared he's gonna
kiss me or something.
He wants to
help us, Chad.
lt only creeps me out.
This one time,
he shows me this picture
of him as a teenager
with hardly
any clothes on.
He kept putting his
hairy freaking mitts
on my shoulders,
going on
about my good heart.
l think it's some
straight up weird shit
l don't even want to. . .
He didn't show you
Yesterdays.
Yeah, that was it,
Yesterdays.
"l've never shown this to
anyone before in my life."
Chad, you have to go.
Why? What's wrong, Terri?
l've got homework to do.
l need to be alone.
Please go, Chad.
lt's Sunday.
What are you
talking about?
Chad, please
just leave me alone.
Terri, what's wrong?
Just leave, Chad.
Whoa! Dude, Terri.
Chill out, man. All right.
You need to go.
Terri, what the hell
is the matter with you?
What are you?
Faggot fucking psycho?
Fucking big-titty
piece of shit?
What the fuck's
the matter with you?
Where'd your
friend go?
Home, l guess.
l'm glad you're
having visitors.
l do understand it.
Well, you're
underestimating me.
Wait. How could you. . . How. . .
Well, how could you think
that l don't understand it?
Because it's got nothing
to do with aesthetics,
that's why.
No. lt's basic mathematics.
lt has to do
with incoming money and
outgoing expenses, Janet.
Hello?
The woman wants to
cannonball into a pool of
ltalian high-heeled shoes.
You tell me something, Terri,
is there anything wrong
with my aesthetic?
What's up with you,
Terri Bear?
Don't call me that.
All right,
let's have it.
Come on,
tell me what's wrong.
Me and Chad Markson
hung out this weekend
and my uncle made us
beans on toast
and we talked.
Beans on toast?
What, you live
in a hobo village?
You guys go off
on your donkeys
after that?
He told me that
you showed him Yesterdays.
Oh, l see.
Yeah. "Oh."
Fitzgerald.
Where?
The same handwriting?
All right,
l'm coming down.
Let's take a walk.
l don't even
understand this.
Well, a zombie is
someone that's died
and comes back to life.
Yeah, l know
what a zombie is, Bob.
l don't see
the connection.
Well, go get the paint.
l'm sorry, Terri.
Come sit down
over here with me.
Did you notice
the new secretary
in my office?
A temp agency sent her over
to help out while Ms. Hamish
was in the hospital.
Her name is Samantha.
She's a really sweet girl.
She's a newlywed,
she lives here in town.
And. . .
l could tell
from the moment
she got here
that she really wants
to work here permanently.
l mean,
it's a five-minute commute,
very convenient for her,
right here in town.
lt'd be a great job
for her, you know?
Anyway, this morning,
she was trying to figure out
through a series of
sideways questions
exactly how serious
Ms. Hamish's illness was.
And she was acting
concerned, of course,
but l could see
in her eyes, you know,
she doesn't know Ms. Hamish.
She can't help it.
There's a part of her
that wants Ms. Hamish
to die.
lt'll get her the job.
So?
So, Ms. Hamish
is dead, Terri.
l got the call
about an hour ago.
l'm sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Don't say things
you don't mean, Terri.
You're not sorry
she's gone.
You barely knew her.
Sorry.
Now, after l got
off the phone
with the hospital,
l called the temp agency
and l told them,
you know, we're gonna hire
Samantha permanently.
And they thanked me and
they said they'd call her
and give her the news.
And l said, "You know,
if you don't mind,
l would rather do it,"
because l kind of wanted
to spring the news on her.
You know, what a great way
for she and l to start our
working together, right?
But now,
l have to tell her
she's got the job
and l will have to watch
while she pretends to be sad.
Life's a mess, dude,
but we're all just doing
the best we can, you know.
You, and me,
and Samantha,
we're just doing
what we can.
So, if l hurt you
or if l lied to you,
all l can tell you
is l'm sorry,
and l will try
to do better.
Maybe l will do better
or maybe l'll do even worse.
l don't know.
l screw up all the time
because that's what
people do,
you know?
Okay, Mr. Fitzgerald.
Ms. Hamish's funeral
is this Friday.
She doesn't have any family
or even any friends.
l was going to
go over there alone
and pay my respects,
but l got to be honest,
it is starting to feel
like a real downer.
l just don't know. Uh. . .
Do you want to come with?
You can come sit
over here with us, Terri.
l'm okay. Thanks.
What a jerk!
Enough, people, enough.
This is something that
we're going to have to
get through together,
as a group.
Now, there will be
a test this Friday
where you will be
asked to showcase
your mucho sewing skills
with a traditional
Mexican poncho.
Take them off, Heather.
Take the sunglasses off,
Heather Miles.
Take them off,
Heather! God !
Hey, everybody,
look at me,
l'm Joe Hollywood.
l am successful.
You should come
because l'm going
to help you out.
l'm hemorrhaging.
l'm on a parking lot.
Oh, Joe Hollywood.
Very nice, Terri.
Would you mind
if we continue
with the lesson?
l'm sorry, Ms. Vick.
Now,
the traditional
Mexican poncho
is centuries
and centuries old.
And what makes it
extraordinary
is the individuality
of all the design,
and that's where
you all come in.
Each one of you
is going to leave
indelibly your own imprint.
The traditional
Mexican costume
is exquisite.
And because they do not have
the kind of industrialization
that we have,
they've been
able to maintain
this ancient
and traditional
culture and dress.
You're all capable
of going on the computer.
l want you all
to look and decide
where is your
particular poncho from.
Think about
what towns,
is it going to be Minatitlán?
ls it going to be Oaxaca?
ls it going to be
San Miguel de Allende?
What have we got?
We've got yarn.
Look at those colors.
And the Mexican flag.
Look how brilliant
that flag is.
l want you to incorporate
these with bright, basic
colors into your ponchos.
And for people
that are shy,
this will be excellent
to start coming out
and wear bright colors
and say to the world,
"Here l am. This is me."
Bye, guys.
Oh, my God,
that was so funny.
Bye, Heather.
Hey, hold on a minute?
Um, hi.
Do you have a second?
Yeah, sure.
l guess l just wanted
to say thank you
for doing
that thing in there,
with the sunglasses.
Okay, yeah.
Can l ask you something,
though?
l mean,
why did you help me?
l'm. . . l don't know,
why not?
l don't know.
Since last week,
it seems like everyone
has decided to hate me
except for you.
Do you know
what l think
it is, Heather?
l think that there's
good-heart kids
and that there is
bad-heart kids
here at the school.
But when l look at you,
when l really look at you,
l know that you're
a good-heart person.
And l guess that
makes me want to help you
or be nice to you or. . .
Because that's what
good hearts get.
l don't know.
Well, thank you, Terri.
l'll see you tomorrow.
Bye, Heather.
Hi, Chad.
Terri Thompson,
the man with the plan.
Terri T, super kid.
Hi, Samantha.
Terri ! Terri !
Terri Thompson's
here to see you.
Yeah, just one second.
Look, l'm sorry
l freaked out
on you, okay?
Why?
Why'd l freak out on you,
or why am l sorry?
Why?
Okay.
l freaked out on you
because you made me feel
bad about Mr. Fitzgerald.
And l don't want
to feel bad about him
because he's my good friend.
And you can think l'm. . .
All right.
Who is ready to mourn?
Samantha, why wasn't Chad
told that his Friday meeting
was canceled?
Um. . . Right.
Just. . . One second.
l'm sorry about this, Chad,
but you must have heard
about Mrs. Hamish's passing.
Well, Terri and l are
just going to the funeral
to see her off, so. . .
Yeah.
We'll make it up next week.
We'll do Thursday and Friday.
How about that?
Mr. Fitzgerald,
could Chad come with us?
l was just going to say
the same thing.
To the funeral?
You know,
l really liked
Ms. Hamish.
She was. . .
She was my friend.
Yeah.
l don't know, Chad. . .
Yeah? l can go?
l'm really going
to miss her.
l'm going to need you
to cut out any kind of
weirdness there, Chad.
Can l have your word
on that?
Oh, yeah. Totally.
All right, boys.
What? What?
Please write down
the schedule,
Thursday and Friday.
Terri, check out her skull.
Gracias. Thank you.
Please don't make me laugh.
Boys, have some respect.
There's a dead person
right here.
We're just. . .
This is us.
Sure.
All righty.
Please. Please.
Amen.
Amen.
Um. . .
No baked beans
in this whole place,
if you can believe it or not.
l just never know
what to get.
What are you getting?
Are you guys
ready to order?
You know,
we're going to need another
minute, if that's all right.
Of course.
Hey, that reminds me.
What's up with you
and that girl Heather?
Oh ! Did you see that?
That did look like
something, yeah.
Nothing.
We've just been talking.
She's coming over tonight.
Wait, like, tonight?
As in tonight, tonight?
7:00, she said.
And it's a date?
She didn't say.
What are you guys
going to do?
l don't know.
l guess l'll. . .
l'm going to show her
around and l'll show her
my paperbacks,
and introduce her
to Uncle James.
And he's got some old records
and l think she likes music,
so. . .
ls your heart breaking
right now?
Mine is.
All right, Terri,
no offense,
but it's time
to take your head
out of your ass, okay?
Chad, watch it.
Sorry, Mr. Fitzgerald.
You have the biggest set
of tits in the entire
school, besides yours,
coming to your
house tonight.
Chad.
She says she just
wants to come over
and see where l live.
Oh, you're going
to blow it.
lf you do, she won't.
Get it?
What is wrong with you, Chad?
Honestly.
Right here. Stop.
Okay.
Listen, Ter,
thanks for tagging
along today, Ter.
lt was weird.
lt was really weird.
lt was awesome.
And good luck tonight, Terri.
You look out for yourself,
okay?
Thanks, Mr. Fitzgerald. Bye.
Don't touch the radio.
What's with the face?
Someone steal
your crackers?
Are you. . .
You look pretty good.
No rhyme
or reason to it.
l don't want to be rude,
but l want to take
advantage of this window,
if you don't mind.
Yeah, sure.
l'm going to go
clean for a bit.
Oh.
Hey, Terri.
How's it going?
What are you
doing here, Chad?
Look, l don't want
to break up a party
or anything.
ls she here?
No, but she's going
to be here any minute,
and l just put
Uncle James down.
Are you gonna get
out of here or what?
Yeah, totally.
Listen, though.
Can l use your restroom
real quick?
No. Go pee in the woods.
l'll see you tomorrow
and l'll tell you
all about it.
l'm afraid it's
a little more serious
than that, Terri.
Are you almost
done in there?
What? Who is it?
Terri? Terri Thompson?
l never liked you, Terri.
Why are you so mean?
Delivery!
Delivery, Terri.
Ooh !
Hi, Terri.
Terri?
Um. . .
ls that your uncle?
lt's my friend Chad.
He'll be gone in a minute.
Terri.
What's wrong with him?
A few different things,
l think.
Have you been
drinking alcohol, Chad?
A little bit.
lf you honestly think that
l'm going to kill the buzz
of a $200 bottle of whiskey.
$200 for one bottle?
lt's not $200, Chad.
lt is so and it is
fucking delicious.
You want. . .
You want me
to go get it?
l don't want any, Heather,
but if you do, you should
go ahead.
Yeah? l should go?
l'm going to find it.
Never mind, Chad.
You know, he's probably
not going to find it anyways.
Hey, do you want to go
see your uncle?
Can he hear us?
l'm not sure.
Anyways, even if he could
hear us, he wouldn't
remember it later on.
He looks sad.
Maybe he can hear us,
but he just doesn't care.
What are you doing?
There's no use in pretending
you're thinking of anybody
but yourself.
Why do you say that?
Heather, he's sick.
Does he talk to you
like that?
No.
Last one to puke
is a rotten egg.
Hmm.
Meet you in the shed then,
fuckers.
Come on. Let's let him rest.
You can go have a drink
with Chad.
l propose a toast,
to good times
and friends.
That's not how
you're supposed
to drink it, Terri.
lt's how
l drink it, okay?
Wait a minute.
Shut up and listen,
you guys.
Sounds like. . .
Like. . .
Hey, give me that.
They're not yours.
Hey!
What the hell was that?
Chad, they're my uncle's.
Your uncle has
a whole houseful, okay?
He's not going to notice
three little pills missing.
l don't think we should.
Well. . .
Think she'll fuck us both?
Yes or no?
What? What?
l know you met
her first, Terri.
Chad, l want you to
take it easy, okay?
No,
l'm pretty sure that. . .
Do we really need
the radio right now?
Look, look at me.
l need you to take a breath
and calm down.
Look at me.
Calm down, okay?
l'm totally calm.
Look, pay attention
next time l'm over there
because she's looking at me
like l'm up for auction.
Maybe we can just deal
without the radio.
l don't want you
to be uncomfortable,
but l think it would be okay
if we just
took one each.
Fuck, yeah.
Let's do it.
What's it going
to do to me?
Just make you feel nice.
l already feel nice.
You can always
feel nicer.
Only one, though, right?
Only one.
You took two pills.
Shh !
Don't tell Terri.
Who cares about that guy?
l care. He's my
great big sweetheart.
Hey.
Uh. . .
Heather,
l have a question.
Um. . .
Why did you get fingered
that one time?
Chad !
Come on.
l'm sorry, Heather.
You don't have to
answer that if you
don't want to.
l'll answer it.
Oh, good.
All girls get fingered
sooner or later, Chad,
but l guess
you wouldn't know
about that.
Yeah. That's nice.
Look, what l was
trying to get at is,
why did you get fingered
in Home Economics?
That's where he
wanted to do it.
He said
nobody would see.
But why Dirty Zach?
Because he wanted to, okay?
And it feels good
to be wanted.
Maybe that sounds
sad to you guys.
l don't know.
No, it's not sad.
lt's not sad at all.
l feel strange.
l feel awesome!
lt's probably
just the pill, Terri.
ls it too strong?
Are you okay?
You look like an adult
over there.
l do?
Like a big shot.
You're so shiny.
l am?
l'm shiny?
l just want to
fuck the whole world.
Cut a hole in the ground,
l'll fuck it all night.
lt feels like
l peed my pants,
but l didn't.
Me, too.
Hey, let's pee our pants
on purpose, huh?
What?
Go for it, Chad.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You don't think
l'll do it?
l hope you do.
l'm doing it,
doing it right now.
Okay.
What did you
think of that?
Chad, that was amazing.
What did you think
about that?
Well, it was new.
Yeah?
Your turn.
My turn to what,
pee all over my clothes?
No, thank you.
You got
to do something.
l mean, l didn't just
do all that for nothing.
l think you did, actually.
Chad,
what are you
talking about?
You have to do something,
Heather.
Gee, Chad,
what do you want me to do?
Yeah, that's right.
l want you
to suck my cock.
Cock?
You call that
little pink thing
stuck to your balls a cock?
Fuck this.
Terri.
Fucking hell !
Hey, guys.
You're not
drinking your drink.
You're supposed to hit it,
not babysit it.
What are you
thinking about?
He wants
to see your tits.
Do you want to see?
l don't know.
No, no.
She wants to
see your tits.
Show her your tits, Terri.
Let's take our clothes off.
l can't.
l'll help.
Terri.
Look.
Terri, come here.
Terri, come over here.
Come on.
Terri.
Terri,
please come over here.
l'm right here, please.
Terri.
Did you have somebody
over here last night?
A girl?
Yeah.
A pretty girl.
Who. . . Was. . .
What happened?
Come on.
Thank you, Terri.
There's some aspirin
in the nurse's station.
Yeah, that would be good.
Well, that was easy.
What the hell is this
lock for anyway?
Aspirin and iodine?
Can l have one, too?
Sky hoop.
What do you think?
She's embarrassed.
l'm not going to
say anything about
what happened
if that's what
she's worried about.
Well, l'm sure she
would appreciate that.
lt's okay.
l don't think l'm ready
for all that stuff yet
anyway.
Who is, you know?
So, do you think
you and your wife are
going to get divorced?
No. No.
Just a fight.
One of many.
What was it about?
For some people, Terri,
enough is just not enough.
How do l look?
Like you slept in a car.
Oh, well.
Are you going
to go home now?
Yeah. l might as well
get it over with.
Where are you gonna go?
l'll probably see
how Chad's doing.
Listen, Terri,
we did not just
enter school property.
Okay.
Yeah?
Are we clear on that?
Very clear.
All right.
Lay five on me.
Come on,
lay five on me.
l will see you on Monday
for our meeting, yeah?
Monday.
All right.
Thank you.
