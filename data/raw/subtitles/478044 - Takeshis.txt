Mr Takeshi!
Can you cast Junior in a movie?
You want to act?
It's a tough job!
Gain weight, lose weight.
Dye your hair. ..
Auditions are coming up.
We'll call you.
I can play a yakuza.
- You are one!
- Really?
We have the guns.
Some water, please.
Water!
Taxi drivers!
How was it?
What was that for?
You owe me, bastard.
- I paid you back.
- No you didn’t.
At least pay the interest!
Always complaining about your job!
You re no better than a pimp!
Lost again.
Taxi drivers have it easy.
They sleep whenever they want.
Then you should try it.
I'm a bad driver.
If you were good?
Let s get moving!
- Where to, sir?
- TV station! Where else?
Idiot! He's sleeping!
Back up!
Interesting. . .
You're so nice to taxi drivers!

- I don't know.
Who are you talking about?
A stalker.
She waits for him everywhere.
- Went too far again?
- Not at all!
Make the cicada sounds loud.
Can you make the lights
real bright, too?
No problem.
- Is it difficult?
- No.
Then do it.
Tell me. . .
Is this '' Winner's Draw'' any good?
Hope they Let mahjong losers in!
Their soy noodle soups are famous.
But the cook is a grouch.
When you order. ..
Wait till I ask!
Request pepper and.. .
Tastes bad?
I ll never go back.
Imagine this. . .
Zomahoun as the cook!
Tastes bad?
They're just right.
Not too hard, not too soft.
Seasoned just right.
Eat them as they are.
Thanks for your work!
She's been following me a while.
I should accept her gift.
Definitely not.
It can't be much of anything.
You're so cold!
End of the shoot today?
Here we go again.. .
I get flowers.
Money would be nicer!
Sometimes there are caterpillars.
They turn into creepy moths. Yuk!
What kind of set is that?
What kind of producer are you?
You never think about artistic value.
Budget is all you care about!
I'm sorry.
What s he doing?
Evening, sir.
- What s that?
- Welcome, Mr Takeshi!
I told you to buy
the right-hand drive.
What's the meaning of this?
- Who's that car for?
- Akihiro Miwa.
We re over budget, Miwa.
Restrain yourself.
Ask the sponsor for more money.
I will if the ratings go up.
It's tough with your ratings.
It s not my fault.
Demand, beg. ..
That s the producer's job.
I'm counting on you. . .
Art! Think Art!
I' ve had it!
Pardon me?
Must be a poltergeist. . .
Amazing!
Something lurking around.
More like a monster.. .
Look behind you.
What a freak!
Last shooting day.

In the way at a TV studio?
Don't worry.
I Il be a good girl.
Whatever.

It s expensive.
Not even the most expensive cream
could help your ugly face.
What an asshole!

Add sound effects, some lights. . .
Just like Okinawa!
Computer graphics?
A great view in the background.
You're ready?
I II get going.

You, girlie, move it.
You're in my way.
Be polite.
She's with Mr Takeshi.
Too bad!

For you, it's '' Mr Takeshi' here.
Problem with my yakuza roles?
I'm sorry, Mr Takeshi.
This guy is a fan.
Doesn't he Look Like you?
Hard to say with that make-up.
You saying I Look Like a clown?
Takeshi darling!
Arrogant prick. . .

He left us all behind.
Wants me to call him Mr Takeshi now.
Arrogant prick!
Hello!

Let's shoot it!
Rolling!
Quiet!
This damned heat!

Me, Clark Gable and you, Bruce Lee.

Let go! I was reading.
We're sorry.
Takeshi darling!
I finally found you.
I feared we were destined
to never meet again.
I don't want to be indiscreet, but. ..
What time does your shift end?
Just you and me. . .
A quiet drink after work.
I'm busy.
Really?
What a shame!
I'm going to be indiscreet again.
I know this great curry restaurant.
Like curry?

An expression of my feelings. . .
Please accept it.
I’ll go out the back.
Where's the toilet?
Out the back door.
Have you seen a bald guy
covered in blood?
Nope.
Hope you get it!
He fell for it!
You told him I was an asshole!
How could you?
I lied.
You'll never get a part!
He never has before!
He'll come back disappointed again.
I can't wait!
Hope you get it!
So?
How did it go?
- I got the part.
- No! Really?
You got the part?
I was right!
I knew you would get it!
Hard work pays off!
Learn from him!
The effort is what counts.

- Always be persistent.
Keep trying
and someone will notice.
God smiles down on you.
Don't be stupid!
' I got the part'' , my ass!
- Whatever!
- Just a fluke!
Must be some dumb character. . .
The kind shot from a roof,
then falls into a river.
Maybe horse-dragged or sword-slain.
A role without Lines
or his face won t be seen. ..
Some extra that gets killed.. .
What an idiot!
He's bragging about that?
Let s get drunk.
That really pisses me off.
Why him?
Let's get drunk!

Bastard!
Into the darkness,
My mother disappeared with her lover
Abandoned, I was tossed around
from one home to another
Abused and humiliated,
I grew up swallowing my tears
When I was little,
An ugly duckling I was
Without a friend
l only had myself
Weird was how they saw me
Miserable was my life
Crouching and sulking,
My life has been a living hell
With resentment and hate
l have survived until today
We're off to a good start.
Our next song is about
parents loving their children. . .
. . .Children loving parents.
A love for rich and poor alike.
An unconditional love
immortalized in.. .
' Heavy Laborer's Song'' !
Sing it for us, Miwa!
I hear it even now
the Heavy Laborer's Song
I hear it even now
That beloved lullaby
At the construction site,
During lunch break
Smoking a cigarette,
I close my eyes
Music tills the air
I hear that song
The song
of the heavy laborer at work
The song
of the poor heavy laborers
This is for my dear husband:
Heave Ho!
This is for my dear wife:
Heave Ho!
This is for my dear children:
Heave Ho!
One more for luck:
Heave Ho!
Let's meet in our dreams
Damn!
Bitch!
You re a pain in the ass!
Where have you been?
Hi!
What do you mean ' hi'' , slut?
Sorry!
I don t know how I got here!
You re too much!
Ready? Go!
I'm taking the money.
Charge!
Charge!
Mr Kitano. . .
Please give him a chance.
His name is Taichi.
Just once. Give him a chance.
Please give him a chance.
I d really appreciate it.
Just once. . .
