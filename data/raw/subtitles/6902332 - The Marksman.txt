You're too young for my sister, Miguel.
She doesn't even know your name.
She will.
What are you doing? Finish your homework.
Dinner's almost ready.
Complete.
Hello?
Rosa.
- You have to leave.
- What?
Take Miguel and go, now.
Wait, wait. What's going on?
The Cartel is after me. You have to go.
What about you?
Don't worry about me.
Just follow the plan.
Carlos, wait, what happened?
They'll want to set an example.
They'll come for you next.
Who was that, mama?
It was your uncle Carlos.
Bring your stuff. We need to leave.
If we don't find it...
What do we tell Angel?
We'll find it.
Mmm-hmm.
You cross the Cartel
Carlos, your family well pay.
Come on, Jackson.
Sorry, girl.
BP, this is Jim Hanson.
I've got four or five IAs
heading north out near my ranch,
about a half-mile from the fence.
Over.
Copy that, Jim.
Agents on the way.
Water.
Easy. Easy.
Hanson here. Better send a medic out.
Found one left behind. Over.
You James Hanson?
Who's asking?
Carl Neeham, from Pima
County Merchants Bank.
It's a Notice of Trustee's sale.
Let you know that the ranch is
to be sold at auction in 90 days.
What?
Law requires you be notified.
I'd have called, but I couldn't
find a phone listing for you.
I was in last month, explained
my situation to Ned Fremont.
- He assured me...
- Yes, well,
Ned's no longer with us.
Not sure why he didn't follow it,
but bank policy is to take action
if there hasn't been a
payment in over six months.
You should also know, Mr. Hanson,
that the bank has the right to sell
the property before those 90 days
if it receives a reasonable
offer from a third party.
Uh...
Mr. Hanson?
That hill over there...
Spread my wife's ashes
on top of it last year.
I'm sorry for your loss.
- Look, Mister...
- Neeham.
I'm no deadbeat.
I just a need a little time to
sort things out, get back on track.
Yeah, like I said, you've got
90 days, you know, most likely.
Um, my number's on there
if you have any questions.
You have yourself a good evening.
Frame's almost built, and I
got to watch my budget and all.
Anyway, don't you have a ranch to run?
Sold most of it off.
Down to the last few head of cattle.
Christine's medical bills wiped me out.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
I can dig that hole for you.
It'll be done by sundown.
I wouldn't be asking if
I didn't need the job.
Look, Jim, that kind of
work is not for someone...
Someone my age? Come on, Randall.
You know I can outwork any man here.
Listen, I got a new
project starting next month.
Come see me then, I'll see
what I can find for you, okay?
Yeah. Okay.
I was out your way last week.
Things are looking mighty lean.
Tell me about it.
At 70 cents per pound,
- we're talking 17 grand.
- Ah.
Could you make it 20?
There's not a lot of profit selling
underweight cattle, you know.
I'm sorry, Jim.
Let me know what you decide, buddy.
Sorry to bother you, Sarah.
I thought you'd want to know.
I appreciate it, Angie.
Yeah. It's been a long time
since I've seen him here.
Hey, there, stranger.
Hey, Sarah.
- This seat taken?
- It's for you.
Drink?
Mmm-mmm. No, thanks.
- Thanks for the call yesterday.
- Mmm.
A few more hours, that fella
would've been one for the coroner.
His lucky day, I guess.
Not sure he sees it that way.
Walked all the way from Honduras,
spent his life savings on a coyote
who left him in the middle of nowhere.
All for naught.
Yeah, it's a cruel world.
That pass has kept us busy all week.
The cartels are running
everything through there.
Drugs, people, guns.
What else is new?
I worry about you,
out there on the front
lines, all by yourself.
It would be fine if the government
would get its shit together
and figure that mess out.
What is going on?
What are you doing back here?
Been wondering that myself.
What the hell am I doing?
I guess I'm trying to understand
how you work your whole life,
serve your country, pay your taxes,
and end up without a pot to piss in.
Lost my home,
my livelihood,
and the only person that
made any of it worthwhile.
Come on, let's... let's get you back.
Come on.
There we go.
Leave it, Sarah. Just leave it.
Ah.
I like to remember her like this.
Smiling, laughing.
I've never seen my mom so happy
as the day she married you.
Wasn't right, her going
out the way she did.
Watching her suffer like that.
I couldn't imagine anything worse.
Now I know.
Come on.
Let's get you to bed.
Come on, Pops.
Rest these old bones.
It wasn't right, Sarah.
I miss her, too.
Yeah?
Rest up.
Yeah.
Get down!
It's the Cartel.
They control this area.
We have to turn back.
We just got here! We're almost there!
If they find us here, I'm dead.
Let's go back
and we'll try on another day.
- Look, I'll pay more.
- It's not worth it.
Please! Please, get us across.
I beg of you, get us across.
Alright.
Just left of that bush
there's a break in the fence.
You want to risk it,
- you're on your own.
- No, no.
Let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
Who's the best dog in the world?
Mom.
Help me.
Hurry! Help me find the opening.
Here!
Who's a good boy?
Jackson is. Jackie...
Jeez.
Hey, hey! Wait, wait!
You're never going to make
it through there like that.
It's miles to the nearest road.
Do you understand?
You... You will help us?
I'll call the Border Patrol.
No! Sir, sir, sir, please! Please!
No. No Border Patrol.
I pay you.
What?
To help us, I pay you.
I'm not a smuggler, lady.
Border Patrol will help you out.
No! Listen, get you to a doctor.
Please, sir! No, no!
Please. Please!
Please!
Dispatch, this is Jim Hanson.
Go ahead, Jim.
I've got two IAs,
about a klick south of Stone Ridge.
Copy that.
We're spread thin right now.
It'll be a few.
Ten-four.
I'll get you some water.
Mom.
Jackson, stay.
Old man!
I am here for the women and the boy.
Speak in English.
I come here to take the woman and the boy.
Sorry, Pancho. These illegals are mine.
You are Border Patrol?
Marine Corps.
So you are keeping your country safe
all by yourself, huh, Marine Corps?
Something like that.
I am a soldier, too.
My orders are to take them back with me.
You're no soldier.
And I don't scare easy.
Now I've already called the cavalry,
so I suggest y'all just
turn around and adi칩s.
I am not going to ask again.
The woman and the boy.
Hand them over.
This ain't worth it, boys.
Give them to me!
Get in the truck. Move.
Mom! Mom!
Oh, shit.
Stay down.
Jackson, quiet.
Jackson!
Dispatch, this is Hanson.
I've just taken heavy fire.
I've got a wounded...
Boss.
Your brother...
He's dead.
Okay, let's...
Nice and easy.
Sir...
They take him, they kill him.
No, look, those guys
are gone. They're gone.
No, please.
All I have...
It's yours... To help him.
This...
My cousin...
In Chicago.
Please.
Mam치.
My love.
My love.
Come here.
You're going to stay with this man, OK?
Take this.
Sir...
Please.
Please.
Mam치.
Mam치.
It doesn't make sense.
No point trying to understand the cartels.
Better just to avoid them.
What's going to happen to the kid?
Unaccompanied minors are
sent to holding in Nogales.
He most likely will end up in foster care.
Diaz.
What was the boy talking about?
He said if you hadn't stopped them,
his mother would still be alive.
Hey, he's just a kid.
Jim, I need you to come by the
station and make a statement.
Good boy, Jackson.
Good morning, babe.
Get some grub, huh?
Let's get some grub.
Good boy.
All I have is yours.
They take him, they kill him.
Please. Please.
God damn it!
Denny, that kid whose
mother died last night,
has he been sent on to Nogales yet?
No, he's being deported.
What?
Mexican authorities say he's got a relative
waiting for him on the other side.
Uh, I need to see him.
Sorry, Jim, can't do that.
Just a few minutes.
I already cleared it with Sarah.
Call her and check.
- Make it quick.
- Thanks.
Psst! Hey, come on.
You're not safe here, comprende?
Let's go, come on.
Come on.
Hey.
Tell the others, we're crossing.
Stay here, understand?
Come on, Jackson. Come on.
God damn it.
Gentlemen.
Passports and visas, please.
Open the back, please.
All clear!
Go ahead.
- What the hell you doing?
- Let me go.
Listen to me or you're
going to get yourself killed.
They send you back, those
men are there waiting for you.
Understand?
Come on.
What?
I'm doing what your mother asked.
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.
You know, Chicago?
Family.
Hell, you don't understand
a damn word I'm saying.
Hey, you hungry?
Thirsty?
Food. Uh...
Comida.
Yeah?
Mmm...
Hey. What's the matter?
You got to be hungry.
That's what I thought.
- Hey.
- Hello.
I need to buy an atlas.
- A what?
- An atlas.
Like a map book. With all the states.
Uh, you could try looking on
that bottom left shelf over there.
We don't really sell maps much anymore.
Everyone pretty much just
googles it on their phone.
Hey, hey!
Huh!
My lucky day.
How about that?
You going on a road trip?
Yeah, something like that.
There's no price on this.
It's probably outdated.
You can have it on the house.
- Thanks.
- Yeah.
Thank you.
- Have a good one.
- You, too.
- Find this guy.
- OK.
Sarah Reynolds.
Sarah, it's Jim.
Thank God.
You all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
Just called to tell you not to worry.
What the hell were you
thinking, taking that kid?
They were going to kill him,
the ones who killed his mother.
They were waiting for him at the border.
So you don't come to me
with that information?
You just take him and leave?
Christ, Jim, you put
my ass on the line here.
I can only keep this
thing quiet for so long.
I need you to bring back that kid.
Now.
I... I can't do that.
Why not?
His mom, she...
We made, like, a deal.
Jim...
Listen.
We sent agents up to your house.
It was burned to the ground.
Whoever these guys were at the
border, they're not messing around.
Now tell me where the hell you are.
I'll call you later.
Jim...
God damn it!
Why the hell did you
have to cross my property?
You damn well ought to
appreciate what I'm doing for you.
I don't even want to be
in your stupid country.
Well, well, well. He speaks.
Hey, Jackson, you hear that?
Hey, got something.
He just used his card at
a gas station in New Mexico
half an hour ago.
Load the gear, let's go.
I want to go home.
Look, it's not safe for you there.
Why are you doing this?
Because your mother asked me to help.
Why did you call the Border Patrol on us?
Because I didn't want to
find your bodies on my land.
If you want to help me,
you could take me back.
I'll find my own way home.
I'm taking you to your family in Chicago.
After that, I don't
give a shit what you do.
Look...
It may not seem like it right
now, but this is what's best.
And I'm sorry.
I'm sorry what happened
to your mom and all.
Shit.
I gotta go, Mom. Bye.
Do you speak Spanish, queen?
No, sorry.
Mmm.
I come here looking for a man and a boy.
And they drive a, uh...
Truck... Tsk!
A pickup truck.
Yeah, he was here.
He was on a road trip.
You know where?
No, sorry.
Do you know, um, which direction he go?
I didn't notice.
Sorry.
Oh.
Was he here?
That's not... That's not
really what that's for...
Show me.
We're heading Northeast.
This is just about dry.
You're lucky the block didn't crack.
You see, it's leaking around the core. Hmm.
There's something lodged in here.
Looks like a slug.
Someone using your truck
for target practice?
Yeah, something like that.
Can you replace the radiator?
Yeah, sure.
Take a day or two to get the part.
We can't wait around that long.
I wouldn't drive it the way it
is. You could blow your engine.
I suppose I could probably
patch it temporarily
so that you could get where you are going.
Great.
- See you tomorrow.
- What?
It's after 6:00. We're closed.
Pima County Merchants Bank.
You may enter an extension at any time.
You've reached the
voicemail of Carl Neeham.
Please leave a message.
Yeah, Mr. Neeham...
Uh, Mr. Neeham, it's Jim Hanson here.
Listen, I was able to work something out.
Uh, if you can give me
just a few more days,
I can come in and make
things current on my loan.
Uh, thanks.
Okay. Double whiskey and a Coke.
You boys ready to order?
I'll have the steak. Rare.
And for the young man?
Can I have a hamburger? Mmm-hmm.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Where'd you learn to speak English?
School.
Must have been a good student.
My mom, she made me study a lot.
Those men at the border,
you know why they were after you?
My Uncle Carlos.
He did something that made the cartel mad.
Called my mom and said we had to leave.
What about your dad?
He's dead.
Died before I was born.
Your name is Miguel?
Yes.
Jim.
I need to go.
Huh?
Oh, yeah. Go on.
Jim.
Jim.
Jackson.
Good boy.
Jackson?
Little shit!
I'll do the shopping from here on.
Yeah, no guarantees on that, yeah?
If I were you, I'd get
the whole thing replaced
when you get back home, wherever home is.
Yeah, will do.
How old's your boy?
He's not my kid.
You know how to read that thing?
We're, uh...
We're around here someplace.
Hello.
Can I help you?
Boss.
Boss.
The card was used 20 miles west of here.
If you had a phone,
we could have looked up the fastest way.
So I hear.
Why do you not have one?
Is it because you're old?
What?
Some old people don't like phones.
No, that's not it.
Nobody needs to call me,
and I like it that way.
Do you think I'll like it in Chicago?
Don't know why not.
I spent some time there one
summer when I was about your age.
I remember...
I remember how green it was.
Oh! And the hot dogs.
You like hot dogs?
You'll like these.
Chicago's famous for them.
No ketchup, though. Uh-uh.
Mustard, pickles, that sort of thing.
Never had one as good anywhere else.
What the hell?
Stay calm and be quiet.
Your license, please.
Looks like you had a little incident.
Yeah.
How are you there today, young man?
Okay.
Any weapons on you, sir?
I've got a .45 under the
seat and a rifle in the back.
Both registered.
Step out of the vehicle, please.
I didn't think I was speeding.
Is there a problem?
I just want to have a word with the boy.
It'll only take a minute.
Jackson, stay.
Walk back to my vehicle, please.
Go ahead and have a seat in the back.
Conley, you out there?
I got tired of waiting and ate without you.
Go ahead and have a seat in your
truck while I run your information.
Can I have my keys so I can run the A/C?
It'll only take a minute.
Jackson... Come on.
Come on.
You, uh... You didn't talk to the boy.
What?
You said you wanted a word with the
boy, but you didn't speak to him.
Get in the truck.
How much?
Excuse me?
How much are they paying
you to betray that badge?
Get in the truck.
You turn us over to them, they'll kill us.
Get in the fucking truck!
Miguel, back in the truck! Now!
Wait here.
What's up?
Stay down.
Where is he?
Hey!
Where is he?
- I don't... What? I don't understand...
- Where is he?
- Where? Where? Where?
- I don't know!
Don't look.
Let's go.
Come on.
I'll be right back.
That'll be fine.
If you're paying cash,
I can do 900 for both.
Ammo is on the house.
- Sounds fair enough.
- Need some ID.
Devil Dog, huh?
'Nam?
Two tours.
Hmm. I had a brother over there.
He didn't make it back.
Sorry to hear that.
We lost some good men.
We did.
Got to run a background check.
Normally doesn't take too
long, but the computer's down.
Might be a few hours,
tomorrow at the latest.
I... I can't wait.
You see, I'm just passing through, and...
I'm sorry, I can't risk losing my license.
Look, I'm no criminal,
but someone's after me,
and I need to watch my back.
The police can't help me.
I know it's asking a lot, but...
It's life or death.
Something bad happens,
these end up in the wrong hands...
I'll report them stolen.
I understand. Thanks.
This trouble you're in...
That your own doing?
Not exactly,
but I made a choice, and
I got to live with it.
So long as it's for the right reasons.
Sarah, Jim's on the phone.
Listen, the DEA says
the man you saw at the
border is Mauricio Guerrero.
Recruited as a kid, soldiering
for the cartel ever since.
And the man that you
shot? That was his brother.
Jeez.
Mexican police have a source that said
that kid's uncle stole money
from the Vasquez Cartel.
Found him hanging from an overpass.
I don't know exactly what
you've got going on here,
but it is not worth it.
This Mauricio will find you,
and when he does,
he will kill you and that boy.
It's time to let this go.
Jim?
Yeah, yeah, all right.
I'll bring him in.
Where are you?
Uh, in the Texas Panhandle somewhere.
A town called Weyburn.
Okay, find the local sheriff's
office. They'll get you back here.
No, I can't trust them.
Fine.
Then I'll come myself.
Just...
Just stay off the streets,
and lay low till I get there.
Can you please do that for me?
Yeah.
What do you think?
- Okay.
- Yeah?
Here you go.
Why are we parking here?
I think it best we stay out of sight.
Come on, take your bag.
I'd like a room, please.
$39 plus tax.
Credit card and ID, please.
Will this do?
Go on, get yourself cleaned up.
You're welcome.
Um... Oh, I'll get some salt for the eggs.
Forget the salt.
Do you think they'll marry?
I don't know.
I suppose they might.
I have a girlfriend at home.
Someday, I'll marry her.
Do you have a wife?
Not anymore.
What happened?
She died.
Cancer. Shitty disease.
They say you get used to
being alone after a while.
That's just crap.
You could get a girlfriend.
I don't think so.
I'm not young and handsome like you.
When we get to Chicago,
the first thing I want
to do is eat a hot dog.
Look, Miguel...
It's late. Maybe you ought
to get some sleep, huh?
Want to go out, boy?
Jackson. Jackson!
Miguel, wake up. We have to go.
911, what's your emergency?
There's a robbery in progress
here at the Blackwood Motel
on Route 12.
There's at least three men with guns.
Three men, sir? Can you describe these men?
Hello?
Go.
Hello, sir? Hello?
Sir, are you okay?
Marine Corps!
You killed my brother!
You can't hide forever, Marine Corps!
We better go, boss.
I will kill you.
The truck is right through there.
Go get in it and wait for me.
Okay? Where are you going?
I got to get my dog.
Go now. I'll be there in a minute.
Jackson, no.
He's in heaven now.
No such thing.
Just something people tell
you to make you feel better.
My dog's nowhere but buried,
and that ain't where he belongs.
You might as well get that heaven
crap out of your head right now.
You are wrong.
The only thing I was wrong about
was driving your ass across the country.
I'm taking you back.
I know about the money.
I looked in the bag.
Get in the truck!
Miguel!
Miguel!
911 got a call on a robbery in progress.
We showed up, the owner's neck was broken.
Still money in the drawer, though.
A guest says he saw a man and a
boy enter this room last night.
Seems they left here in a hurry.
Maybe you can explain
what the hell is going on.
Where are you, Jim?
Look, maybe I should have
said something about the money.
It doesn't matter now, but...
I made a mistake thinking I could help you.
We're not going to Chicago?
I'm sorry about Jackson.
He was a great dog.
Yeah. Yeah, he was.
Thanks, um, for helping
give him a proper burial.
I hope someday there's
a funeral for my mother.
Come on.
Excuse me, sir.
Um...
I was wondering if you could help...
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord.
May the perpetual light shine upon Rosa.
And may her soul, through the mercy of God,
rest in peace.
Amen.
Thanks.
It's a lonely experience
to lose someone so close,
especially for a child.
He's your, what? Grandson?
No. Um, I knew his mother.
She asked me to look after him.
That's no small request.
She must have had a lot of faith in you.
Jim?
Yeah, it's me.
Tell me you're safe.
- We're okay.
- Is that him?
Find out where he is.
Good. Now tell me exactly where you are.
- I got the sheriff with me.
- Sarah...
I got plenty of firepower.
I just need to know...
Sarah.
Listen, the kid's not going back.
That's what I'm calling to tell you.
I'm doing what his mother asked.
I'm taking him to her family.
That is not up to you.
And what kind of life's he
going to have back in Mexico?
In protection forever,
if he even lasts a week?
He can apply for asylum here.
With what happened to his mother,
he'd have a strong case.
Can you guarantee he'll get it?
Especially the way things are now?
Tell me what's going on with you here.
Let me help you while I still can.
This kid, he...
He didn't bring any of this on himself.
He just needs someone to give him a chance.
I can't shake the feeling
that your mom is somehow
guiding me through this.
She'd want me to help this kid.
If you do this, there's nothing
more I can do to help you.
I know.
You do what you've got to do.
We're heading to Chicago.
Give me a few hours if you can.
See you around, Sarah.
So? What'd he say?
Where's he headed?
I don't know.
{\an8}The killer of a highway
patrol officer yesterday.
{\an8}Officer Jay Conley was
found murdered along Highway 40,
west of Amarillo.
Police say they have little to go on,
and are asking for the public's help.
Anyone who may have
witnessed anything suspicious
is asked to contact the
Texas authorities or the FBI.
In other news,
closing arguments are expected to begin...
I guess we'd better buy another map.
Figure out how to get you to Chicago.
Boss.
Hello?
Yeah.
No problem.
Miguel, come here.
Want to try?
Look, stand here.
Now, your finger here.
There you go.
Now, line up this with this notch
with that can on the left.
Spread your legs a little.
Now, put your finger on the trigger.
The gun's going to kick back hard,
so brace yourself.
And when you're ready, just squeeze.
Try it again.
Hold it steady, relax your shoulders.
Keep them loose.
Now, take a deep breath,
let half of it out...
And squeeze that trigger.
You're a natural.
Press this button here
to remove the magazine.
Pull the slide back to clear it.
Now the gun's empty and safe.
You were a soldier?
Yeah. Marine.
- You fought in a war?
- Mmm-hmm.
You killed other soldiers?
Someday, I will kill those men.
There's absolutely nothing that
feels good about killing another man.
Your mother died to give you
a chance at a better life.
Don't waste it.
This is the spot.
Do you still get sad when
you think about your wife?
I miss that woman every day.
Life doesn't always play
out the way you expect.
There are good times ahead for you, Miguel.
Your mom's watching over.
She'll make sure of that.
This belongs to you.
I don't want it.
It's cartel's money.
Then I guess we've got no use for this.
You know something?
It's not bad.
Ready?
Where are we going?
Let's take some side roads for a while.
Hello.
Exit 209?
You sure?
OK, thank you.
Five miles back.
Look! It's him.
Go ahead! Go ahead! Go ahead!
Is that him?
Hold on tight.
Shit!
Get out.
We should run. He'll kill us.
Not if I get him first.
Miguel, let's go.
Come on.
Boss, boss.
Where is that bastard?
Come on.
Stay down. Here.
If anything happens to me,
you get out of here, and you
run as far away as you can.
Understand?
Miguel, come over here.
I need you to create a distraction.
Count to 30, then fire
two quick shots out there.
It's ready.
Start counting. Now.
I'm going around.
10, 11...
14, 15...
28, 29...
Miguel?
Marine Corps!
Get in here and let's finish this!
Drop your gun!
Drop it!
Let him go, you bastard.
Let him go?
Why?
He's going to make a good soldier one day.
He's going to be trained by the best.
He will never kill for you.
No?
You know, I was...
I was just like him one day.
We all learn to do what
we must do to survive.
Just like you and me, soldier.
We made our choices.
Let him make his.
Do you think I had a choice?
Huh?
I never had a choice!
Miguel.
Now he's going to kill his first man today.
- Same as...
- Miguel.
Look at me.
Yeah!
Shoot!
Shoot!
Avenge your mother.
Miguel, don't listen to him.
Don't do it.
Kill me.
Kill me.
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun.
Kill me.
Miguel, walk away.
Walk away. Now.
Wait.
Now you have a choice.
This is for you.
Miguel!
Thank God you're OK, son.
Come here.
Come here.
Everyone come here!
It's Miguel.
