l had to beg my dad forthat...
l made up mymind
to spendtime with you
l wantedto talk to you
l said l have work till 8 pm
l lied

l said l lied
Are you watchingthefilm?
Like it? Or can l talk?
Likeit...but wecan talk
Let's be just friends Karthik...
Otherwise therewill betoo much pain...
l don'twant that
Nowadays l feel liketalking to you
spendingtime with you
That's why l am herewith you
l don't want to lose this
lfthere's love between us...
wecan't be free
its too much pressure
what peoplewill think
we'll beworried if someone
is seeing us
Can webethis without love?
Can l go homeandtell my dad
Karthik who lives downstairs
is my friend
we don'thave anything between us
You can come up and
spend time with me
Crossing all boundaries...
but not together
No secrets...no ego...
Nothing??
You arethefirst guyto kiss me
l have not dated any guy
l'll walk home from here
What are you tryingto proveJessie?
Thatit's no big deal?
How can l delete my love?
How is thatpossible?
That too for your dad?
How do you do thatJessie?
Then you talk about yourfirst kiss...
You won't touch me...

Then, how can we bejust friends?
Do you understand anything

You feel like spendingtime with me,
its onlybecauseoflove...
Takethat love away...
then you won't feel this way
You wantedto go tell your dad...''the Karthik
who lives downstairs and l are just friends''
You should not say that!
You should say''Karthik loves me with all his heart,
hewants to spend his entirelifewith me...
...dad, l want to bewith him''
You told me your dad let you go alone
to Kerala forthefirsttime
l think he has changed...
Won't his intelligencematch

Heisn't theoldJoseph you know
Hemight accept me
Will you go tell him?

Ma, l was talking to her generally
Her brother madea big issue out ofit
Hetried to getmy girl...
Won't her brother get angry?
lfmy son cameafter your daughter...

When you saw menearthegate...
each timel saw something
in your eyes
When l saw you in theterrace
l wanted to touch your face
When you proposed to me,
walking bymy side on theroad
l thought you found out
When you apologisedto me here
When you wrote 'FRlENDS?' in the train
myheart pounded louderthan the train!
That's why l didn't stop you
That's whyl kissed you...happy?.
Don'tbehere...go home

Onedayl smiled...
the next dayl was filledwith hatred
l buried you alive!
will you forgive me?
will you forgive me?
can you forgive me?
Dearest, l walked aimlessly
Likea raindrop
hanging at the end of a string
indecisively...
ltis because of you
l became a creator
You are the distant light
You are making megravitate
towards you
what do l do with myheart
that yearns, aches and
thinks only of you
l am a small ripplein
thewaterthat runs
you are themoisture within
l let it go despite my wish being granted
Will you forgive me? My dearest!
l am justa blank paperfluttering
in thebreeze
You added words
to makeitmeaningful
l started with love...
now myis love complete
You are my beacon oflight!
Onedayl smiled...
the next dayl was filledwith hatred
l buried you alive!
will you forgive me?
will you forgive me?
can you forgive me?
There is no lock fortruelove
tears are the only expression ofuntold love
onewho cannot lovewill ask for everything selfishly
onewho can lovewill sacrifice et al!
l wentto fight with him, instead l hugged him
'cos myheart had alreadyhugged him!
Why did you comeinto
mylife, my beloved?
Are you an illusion that will vanish?
Night is when everyone is asleep
That's the time fortears on my pillow!
Onedayl smiled...
the next dayl was filledwith hatred
l buried you alive!
will you forgive me?
will you forgive me?
can you forgive me?
Dearest, l walked aimlessly
Likea raindrop
hanging at the end of a string

You are the distant light
You are making megravitate
towards you
what do l do with myheart
that yearns, aches and
thinks only of you
...again and again
We'veloaded all our stuff...
Here's your key
Don't start something new
Correct entry?.
Have you been waiting for long?
You have to...and be patient...

but you join today
Thank you sir
l don'twant Mr.Ganesh
to misunderstand me
Heknows you arean angel...

How longwill you wait?
Do l reallyhaveto answer this?
l know you'll say however long

Silver moon,will you come with me?
My body... my soul

Darling, will you cross theskies for me?
Will you cross theskies for me?
Will you cross theskies for me?
Star,will you come to me?
Cameraman shouldwalk

That's the hero's position
He's seperated from theheroine
for nearly 45 days...
Pan from his faceto show his feeling

theappropriatescore
Whatare you so pre-occupied with?
lf you don't concentratehere...
it's likea slap on my face
Roy, you'vecomeearly
lt's upto you actually, you understand right??
What is this dialogue?
...blah...blah... no need ofthis scene
But its veryimportant sir
l know it is important, but that is so cliched
which father has supported love
ifhedid hewon't be accepted
bytheaudience
Otherwise the father will threaten
to commitsuicide
How many films will have
thesamedialogue?
Let's think of something new
Karthik will beover my deadbody, Jessie

Oh! go ahead...wewill wait
