Aah!
Man: "Dimitrios Makropoulos."
The case of
Dimitrios Makropoulos
Is now officially closed.
That is all, gentlemen.
Colonel Haki,
could you tell me-
I'm sorry.
Gentlemen, there is
nothing I can add
To what you've
heard here.
I've known of this
Dimitrios Makropoulos for years,
And yet have known
so little about him,
So very little.
We'll probably never
know who killed him.
But whoever it was
did us all a favor.
Good night.
Good evening,
colonel Haki.
Good evening.
Ooh, colonel Haki,
how nice to see you.
Madame Chavez.
This is such
a wonderful party,
So many beautiful women.
But none more beautiful
than yourself.
You flatterer.
I've got a surprise for you.
The Dutch writer
Cornelius Leyden.
Cornelius Latimer Leyden
here? Wonderful.
You invited him for me?
You expressed such
a desire to meet him.
I must say I expected
a different sort.
Writers are writers.
Yes, but Mr. Leyden
tells me he was professor of economics
At the university
of Amsterdam before he became a writer.
He looks like it.
Ha ha.
Ah, there you are,
Mr. Leyden.
I want you to meet
my good friend colonel Haki,
Who's
an ardent reader of your books.
How do you do?
Mr. Leyden,
I long wanted to talk
To the writer whose work
I so much admire.
Thank you
very much.
Well, I’ll leave
you gentlemen to discuss literature.
It would bore you,
perhaps,
But long have I
admired Mr. Leyden,
And you understand,
Madame.
But of course.
You'll excuse me, please?
Madame.
I read nothing but
detective stories.
I get them sent
from Paris.
All the best
are translated into French.
To you, Mr. Leyden.
Thank you.
I've just added
your une pelle ensanglantee
To my library.
Formidable.
But I cannot quite
understand
The significance
of the title.
Well, "bloody shovel."
Exactly.
It is my ambition
to write
A good detective
story of my own.
I have often thought
I could do so,
If I had only
the time.
Oh, Madame,
such a pleasure.
Colonel Haki.
I've got to play
the fool like this.
It is expected
of me.
But don't think
I like it. A cigarette?
Yes, please.
Please follow me.
I should like very much
to talk to you,
But these women...
Come, let us go
to the veranda
Where we will not
be disturbed.
This is better.
Mm-Hmm.
Thank you.
You must excuse me
if I am a little nervous.
All day I’ve been
involved in the affairs
Of a murderer.
Are you interested
in real murderers, Mr. Leyden?
Maybe. Why?
I find a murderer
in a detective story
Much more sympathetic
than a real murderer.
Have you ever heard of
Dimitrios Makropoulos?
I don't think so.
I've known of
his existence for nearly 20 years.
A dirty, cowardly
type.
Murder, espionage,
assassination.
Assas-Well, that argues
a certain courage,
Doesn't it?
My dear Leyden,
Dimitrios would have
nothing to do with the actual shooting.
Their kind never
risk their skins for that.
They stay on the
fringe of the blood.
But to me the most
important thing to know about an assassination
Is not who fired
the shot, but who paid for the bullet.
That's true.
As far as I know,
no government ever caught Dimitrios,
And there is
no photograph in his dossier.
But we knew him,
all right-
And so did Athens,
Sofia, Belgrade, Paris.
He was a great traveler,
this Dimitrios.
Was? Sounds as if
he were dead.
Yes, he's dead.
His bloated body
was washed ashore this morning.
It is believed he
had been knifed
And thrown in
the Bosporus.
But then he died
by violence.
That's very much
like justice, isn't it?
There's the writer
speaking.
Everything must be
tight, artistic,
Like a detective
story.
The case of
Dimitrios has loose ends-
Dozens of them.
In just one hour
his body will be disposed of,
And the loose ends
will still be loose ends.
You see?
It is not artistic.
Now tell me,
Mr. Leyden,
Is there anything
in this story that could be
Of the slightest
interest to a writer?
I- I've always liked
police work.
Colonel Haki,
I have a rather strange
request to make.
Anything.
I would very much like
to see the body
Of that Dimitrios,
if it's possible.
By all means,
but-
You know, I’ve never
seen a dead man.
Not even in a mortuary...
ugly devil, isn't he?
These eyes have seen
things I should like to see.
It is a pity that
the mouth can never speak about them.
For 20 years it was
my hope to get him.
Now-
Not very
prepossessing,
Is he, Mr. Leyden?
I- It isn't quite what
a thought it would be.
Would you like
to see the wound?
No, uh...
see?
It's getting warm
in here.
Well, do you still
want to hear more of Dimitrios?
If you have the time.
The evening
is young.
Shall we go to
my hotel?
It's a little better
there.
Splendid.
Well, all we know
of Dimitrios
Is that he was born
in 1889.
He was found abandoned,
parents unknown.
A poor family
adopted him.
A good deed they
had cause to regret.
1889...
you have an
exceptional memory.
That is my business.
The first time we heard
of him was in Smyrna, in 1922.
The city was under martial law,
And I was the head of
the military police.
At that time,
Dimitrios worked as a fig-Packer
Who already had
a criminal record...
Abdul.
Abdul Dhris.
Dimitrios.
Are you in trouble?
I must flee the country.
But I have no money,
and the shipmasters
Are asking 1,000
piasters for passage.
Well, I’m a poor man,
you know.
But if you could wait
till Saturday-
Oh, I can't.
But, Abdul, I know where
I can get the money.
1,000 piasters-
2,000,
and 2,000 for you.
What would
I have to do?
Very little.
It's Dimitrios, Konrad.
Open up.
I got the plate,
Konrad.
I told you to come alone.
Abdul's my partner.
He shares with me.
Let me see the plate.
If it isn't gold,
I’m not interested.
It's gold.
I'll show you in back.
Come on.
Let me see it now.
They shoot looters.
I risked my life
for this plate.
Come on.
Now let me have
the plate.
First, we'll see
what's in your safe.
Robber!
Now I’ll show you
the plate.
You said we wouldn't
kill him.
He'd tell the police.
He's better dead.
I was willing to
rob him, but murder...
they'd hang us
for robbery alone, you fool.
There's martial law
here now.
But you killed him before
you opened his safe.
His safe's full of
worthless junk.
Oh, he was a clever one,
that Konrad.
But not clever enough
for Dimitrios.
Here it is! That's where
I saw him hide it.
His money?
Naturally.
Ali! Wine!
Fill them up again
for everybody!
Ali, bring the wine!
Ali, where-
We was only having
a little drink.
Would you have
a drink with us?
I do not drink.
You seem to have
a lot of money.
Perhaps you could
tell me where you got it.
Why, I...
Dimitrios?
Wait, Dimitrios!
I was only having
a little drink...
I did not kill Konrad,
I tell you I did not
kill him.
He stabbed himself?
He robbed his own
money?
1,200 piasters
were found in your possession.
A fig-Packer,
you affirm only to the winds.
I will give you
one more chance.
Did you or did you
not rob Konrad?
Rob him? Yes, yes,
I robbed him.
But I did not kill him.
It was Dimitrios,
Dimitrios who did it.
And who is Dimitrios?
He is a fig-Packer,
and a bad one.
He is always in trouble.
And he has fled
the country, no doubt?
Yes, that's why
he wanted the money.
I am a man who loves
other men as brothers.
I would not speak-
Enough! Hold your
tongue, imbecile.
You've admitted that
you robbed Konrad. That is sufficient.
Even if there was
6 Dimitrioses,
You would still
be guilty.
The sentence is death.
Take him out.
No! No, no!
Oh, no, no, no!
I did not kill Konrad!
I tell you, I did not
kill him!
It was Dimitrios!
Dimitrios! Dimitrios!
That beggar was right.
But we had no definite proof
till later.
What a despicable
character,
But as much as
I hate to admit it,
Very brilliant.
Oh, yes.
I don't deny it.
I see it intrigues
your fancy.
You want to know more?
Certainly, I want
to know more.
I learned he had fled
to Athens.
I issued a warrant
for his arrest, but he escaped me.
Later I found out that
he sometimes used the name of Talat.
Talat? T-A-L-A-T?
But again too late,
huh?
Yes. From Athens
we traced him to Sofia,
Where in '23
a man named Dimitrios
Was connected with
the Stambulisky affair.
No?
Then he turned up
in Belgrade.
That was... let me see-
Oh, yes, in 1926.
This time stealing
military secrets.
Military secrets?
Nothing was too big for him, huh?
No.
And the last time I heard
of him was in Paris
In connection with
an international smuggling gang.
When was that?
Between '29 and '31,
about that time.
The gang was
eventually broken up.
Dimitrios had
betrayed them.
That's logical.
Murder, treason,
and betrayal.
That's
the finishing touch.
What an evil genius
that man was,
But fascinating.
Wonderful character
for a novel.
You really think so?
There's so much
I don't know.
For instance, what is it
about a man like that?
Why does anybody trust
him in the first place?
Details. If I could
only know more details.
You will need patience,
Mr. Leyden.
Yes. You see,
colonel Haki,
I'd love real characters
for my stories.
And that man, well...
he obsesses me,
and I admit it,
And I have to go on.
I don't know whether
I should like you
For introducing me
to that Mr. Dimitrios
Or whether I should
hate you for it.
It's true.
I come to Istanbul for a little rest.
Well, tracing the
life of Dimitrios,
I don't think
that will be a very peaceful occupation,
Do you?
No. Ha ha!
Where did you say
he went from Smyrna?
Oh, Athens.
I want a ticket
for Athens, please.
Tomorrow morning.
One ticket.
Leyden on phone:
what is the earliest train?
7:00.
Thank you very much.
Yes, sir.
I beg your pardon.
Is there a man named
Konstantin Gollos
Staying
in this hotel?
No one by that name
is registered, sir.
Could you tell me
if a Mr. Gollos has been registered here
Any time during, say,
the last 30 days
Or has he made
any reservation?
Just a moment, please.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't find any record of that name.
Thank you, sir.
I beg your pardon,
But would it be
possible for me to view the remains
Of a man, you have here?
He may be a relative.
The place is empty.
Clean.
The paper
said a man named Dimitrios Makropoulos-
Oh, him.
He's been disposed of
an hour ago.
Disposed of...
Come. It's a question
of patience and organization.
Organization is the secret
of modern statecraft,
But patience is necessary.
You say the surname
was Makropoulos?
That's right-
Makropoulos.
Dimitrios Makropoulos.
That would be
drawer number 13.
Why? Because "m" is
the 13th letter of the alphabet.
Oh.
This is
organization.
That's very good.
Makropoulos,
Makropoulos,
Makropoulos...
Makropoulos,
but no Dimitrios.
Gone.
Who is gone?
Didn't you see that
stout gentleman?
I have no assistants
in my work of organization here.
The whole burden falls
on my shoulders,
And people
have no patience.
I'm engaged
for a moment, they cannot wait.
A man can only do
his duty,
No more, no less.
But patience...
pardon me, sir,
Could we try under
the name of Talat?
Talat? That is
a Turkish name.
I know,
but could we try?
Talat. "T" that is
the 20th letter of the alphabet.
That will be
drawer number-
20.
Very clever.
Talat!
Dimitrios Talat.
Yes?
A fig-Packer?
That's right.
Mm-Hmm...
name-Dimitrios Talat;
Born-Salonika, 1889;
Occupation-Fig-Packer;
Identity card lost...
said to have been
issued at Smyrna;
Warrant for arrest
on charge of robbery
And attempted murder.
That's Dimitrios,
all right.
You see?
That is organization.
Here you are,
my man.
Porter:
thank you.
Hd
I must apologize
for intruding on your privacy.
Oh, please.
You're not intruding.
This berth was not
occupied.
How good of you
to say so.
How little
kindness there is in the world today,
How little thought
for others.
May I ask how far
you are going?
I'm going to Sofia.
Oh, beautiful city.
Beautiful.
I am continuing
to Bucharest.
Oh?
I trust that we shall
have a pleasant journey together.
I hope so.
Will you allow me
to smoke, please?
Please,
go right ahead.
You know, the moment
the attendant told me
That there was a
Hollander on the train,
I knew that I should
have a pleasant journey.
That's very kind of you
to say so.
I'm English by birth.
But actually, I’m
a citizen of the world.
To me, all languages
are beautiful.
If only men would
live as brothers without hatred,
Seeing only
the beautiful things.
But no, there are
always people who look on the black side.
Well...
I think I’m going
to sleep now.
Sleep-
A great mercy vouchsafed
to us poor humans.
My name is Mr. Peters.
How do you do?
If you'll forgive me,
I think we're getting
to Sofia very early.
Good night, sir.
We are coming into
Sofia, sir.
Thank you,
I’m all ready.
Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
I'm sorry, I tried
not to awaken you.
I was not really
asleep.
I want to tell you
that the best hotel to stay in Sofia
Is the Slelyanska
Posada.
Oh, really? Thank you,
that's very kind of you.
That's the trouble
with this world.
There's not
enough kindness.
Good-Bye,
Mr. Leyden.
Happy journey,
sir.
How did he know my name?
I didn't tell him.
I'm very happy
to repay you
For the kindness you
showed me in Amsterdam, professor.
You are very
clever people, you journalists.
I just talked to you
this morning,
And already
you have discovered
The only person here
who knew Dimitrios.
How did you do this?
It was very easy
The moment you mentioned
the fact that Dimitrios
Was one of the foreign agents
in the Stambulisky affair.
This is her establishment.
She's the proprietress.
She does not get up
until about 10:00 in the evening,
So we'll probably
have to wait awhile
Before we can talk
to her.
Oh, that's all right.
You wished to see me,
messieurs?
Reporter: we should
be honored
If you would sit
at our table for a moment.
Of course.
Leyden:
thank you, Madame.
Champagne.
Waiter:
yes, Madame.
I've not seen you
before, monsieur.
I've seen you,
but not here.
You going to write about me
for the Paris newspapers?
So you'll stay and see the rest
of my entertainment?
We are trespassing
on your hospitality
To ask for some
information.
Information?
I know nothing of
interest to anyone.
Your discretion is
famous, Madame.
This, however,
concerns a man,
Now dead and buried,
Whom you knew over
15 years ago.
You pay me the most
Delicate compliments,
monsieur.
15 years?
You can't expect me
to remember a man that long.
Me hardly dared to hope
that you'd remember,
But if a name means
anything to you,
It was Dimitrios.
Dimitrios Makropoulos.
Get out.
Both of you.
I don't like you in here.
But, Madame-
Get out!
Sit down.
You think I want
a scene in here?
If you will explain
how we can leave
Without standing up,
I shall be grateful.
Are you
a policeman?
Oh, no, he's not
with the police.
He's a writer of books.
He seeks information.
Why?
He saw the dead body
of Dimitrios in Istanbul
And he's curious
about him.
He's dead.
You're sure he's dead?
You actually saw
his body?
It was found
in the Bosporus.
He'd been stabbed.
Did he have
any money on him?
Now I shall never
get it back.
Wait...
come with me.
Madame?
Bring it to my room.
Dimitrios...
July the 15, 1923.
That's when the money
became due to me.
He promised faithfully
he'd pay me.
You're sure
there was no money?
No. Even
his clothes
Were cheap
and shabby.
I would've sworn
he'd become rich.
Dimitrios was not a man
one forgets easily.
I've known many men
But I’ve been afraid
of only one
Dimitrios.
Voiceover: I will remember
the first time I ever saw him.
I'd just returned
from a drive with a friend.
Until tomorrow then.
Where to now,
monsieur Bostoff?
Home.
- Hello.
- Hello.
You have kept me waiting
long enough.
I want my money.
I want it right away.
I haven't got it.
I'll have it for you in a day or two.
And I who have been
a hotelkeeper for 17 years
Should believe a story
about a check?
It's coming.
I don't know what's held it up.
Tonight I’ll send
a telegram.
With what?
I thought you'd
lend me 10 leva.
I would as soon
throw the money into the street!
There are things about
this hotel the police would like to know.
The fire hazards,
the broken stairs-
You think you can
intimidate me?
My place is open
to the police at all times.
They are my friends!
You cheap crook.
It is
I who will call the police.
I'll have you
arrested for fraud.
120 leva by
tomorrow morning,
Or the police
will come.
Understand?
Irana:
who is it?
What do you want?
You've got the wrong place.
I live in the room
next door.
I've seen you
around, but-
How dare you!
You got any food?
What?
Something to eat.
You really are
hungry?
Would I ask a woman
for food if I weren't starving?
Irana, voice-Over:
he was hungry and homeless.
I fed him and gave him money.
He paid me back
in his own peculiar way.
Yes?
It's me-
Dimitrios.
Oh, go away.
Open up,
it's important.
No, I’ve done all
I’m going to do for you.
Yeah. But I want
to pay you back.
I've got 2,500 leva
to give you.
2,500 leva?
Are you crazy?
Look under the door.
Got 1,500 more to give
you if you let me in.
1,000 you have,
another 1,000, and 500,
And 2,500 for me.
You were starving,
and now-
Now I’m paying you back
for that crust of bread you gave me-
A very good payment.
Where did you get
this money?
There's plenty more
where this came from.
I called on
monsieur Bostoff this morning.
You didn't.
I asked him for the money,
and he gave it to me.
I only had to mention
your name.
You blackmailed him.
How could you?
He loved me.
He was a funny,
fat little man,
But he loved me.
I'm not fat or funny,
but I love you.
You love me.
You blackmailed
Bostoff to show your love.
It costs money to love.
If he loved you,
why didn't he take you out of this hole?
A girl as beautiful as you
should have the best.
Jewels, furs,
a fine apartment.
I'll get them for you.
By blackmail?
What are you thinking
about?
Wine.
What about the wine?
I like it.
I must be crazy.
Why?
To love you.
What's wrong
with that?
Everybody stay
where you are.
Have your
papers ready.
Your passport.
Dimitrios Makropoulos.
Your name is familiar.
You're a member of
the C.M.U.
There's no law
against that.
No, not yet.
But we do not like
foreigners who belong to
So-Called "Bulgarian
patriotic societies."
Come along.
You're wasting
your time.
I've a great deal
of time. Come along.
Irana, voice-Over: Dimitrios
stayed in jail only long enough
To get in touch with
a man he knew,
Someone to whom
he would not introduce me.
Man: you understand that
I have watched for you.
Yes, I understand.
The moment I withdraw
my guarantee,
You will be deported
to Greece.
All right, all right.
I said I’d do the job,
monsieur Vaxoff.
But it's difficult work,
and the price is-
The price is quite
high enough.
Irana, voice-Over:
I knew that this important friend of Dimitrios
Had secured his release
for a purpose.
But what that purpose was
I did not know
Until a few days later,
When all Bulgaria
heard of it.
Dimitrios!
What's the matter?
The police will be here
at any moment.
You must tell them
I’ve been here all day.
What have you done?
There's no time
for that now.
Who is it?
Yes?
How long has he
been here?
All afternoon,
But I don't see that
that's any business of yours.
You'd swear
to that in court?
Naturally.
What do they mean?
I'm a Greek subject,
But my passport
is in order.
I don't understand.
I'm not without
friends in Sofia.
Perhaps you know
monsieur Vaxoff?
Mr. Vaxoff?
Of the Eurasian credit trust?
I see.
Dimitrios,
what happened?
It'll be in
all the papers.
An attempt was made to
assassinate the premier- Stambulisky.
Not you.
Of course not.
However, I’ll have to
leave town for a while.
How much money
have you got?
Money?
But I thought you-
I'll need
1,000 French francs.
I know you've got it.
I've given you plenty.
Why don't you get it
from your important monsieur Vaxoff?
Because they'll be
watching him for a while.
I'll send you the money
back in a week...
with interest.
That's the last time
I saw Dimitrios.
If you will excuse me,
messieurs,
It's time I returned
to my guests.
You see,
I know nothing about Dimitrios
Of any interest.
It was of great
interest, Madame.
I'm very thankful.
Won't you allow me
to pay you
For the drinks,
Madame?
If you like.
No. I have
a superstition
About money being shown
in my private room.
You can pay the waiter
at your table.
Thank you.
Good night, Madame.
Utterly without scruple.
Completely unmoral.
But fascinating.
That's funny...
would you be so good
as to shut the door behind you?
I think if you
stretched out your left hand,
You could do it
without moving your feet.
What is the meaning
of all this?
This is
most awkward.
I didn't expect you
back so soon.
I can see that.
I had hoped to get
things tidied up. Such vandalism.
A book is
a lovely thing.
A garden stocked
with beautiful flowers.
A magic carpet on
which to fly away to unknown climes.
What are you
talking about?
A little frankness,
Mr. Leyden, please.
There could only be
one reason
Why your room should
be searched,
And you know that
as well as I do.
Of course
I can understand your difficulty.
You're wondering
exactly where I stand.
If it's any consolation
to you, however, I may say my difficulty
Is wondering exactly
where you stand.
I'm tired.
I'll go to bed.
Say, what on earth
are you doing here?
Last night I met you
on a train.
You said you were
going to Bucharest.
Now I find you here
Waving this silly pistol
in my face.
I can only conclude
you're a thief or you're drunk.
Are you drunk, sir?
Maybe you're mad.
Well, in that case,
I can only humor you
And hope for the best.
Perfect.
No, no.
Keep away from that
telephone, please.
Since you have returned
so unexpectedly,
Since I can no longer
meet you on a basis of,
May I say,
disinterested friendship,
Let us be frank
with one another.
Why are you
so interested in Dimitrios?
Dimitrios?
Yes,
dear Mr. Leyden, Dimitrios.
You've come from
the Levant.
Dimitrios came
from there.
In Athens, you were
very energetically seeking his record
In the relief
commission archives. Why?
Well-
Wait before you answer.
I have no animosity
towards you.
I bear you no ill will,
let that be clear.
But as it happens,
I, too, am interested in Dimitrios.
And because of that
I am interested in you.
Now, Mr. Leyden, tell me
frankly where you stand.
What-Forgive the
expression, please-
Is your game?
My game, huh?
Well, I’ll tell you
what my game is
If you tell me yours.
I have nothing to hide.
Would you mind telling me
what you hope to find
In the bindings of
my books or in the tube of my toothpaste?
Would you mind
telling me that?
I was looking
for an answer to my question.
But all I found
was this.
You see, I felt that if
you hid papers between the leaves of books,
You might also hide
more interesting papers in the bindings.
It was never intended
to be hidden.
And is this
all you know
About Dimitrios,
Mr. Leyden?
No.
Now, who, I wonder,
is this colonel Haki
Who seems so
well Informed and so indiscreet?
The name is Turkish.
And poor Dimitrios
was taken from us in Istanbul, was he not?
And you have come
from Istanbul, haven't you?
Mm-Hmm.
You know,
it almost looks as if you'd been reading
A Turkish police
dossier,
Now, doesn't it, eh?
For every question
you ask,
You'll have to
answer one.
Had you ever met him?
I mean, actually met him?
I don't think you're
very sure of yourself, Mr. Leyden.
I have an idea that I
can tell you much more
Than you can tell me.
I think I must be going.
Good night.
I thought
you were going. Good night.
Istanbul, Istanbul,
Smyrna, 1922, Sofia.
Now, I wonder...
I wonder if it would be
very stupid of me to imagine
That you were thinking
of going to Belgrade in the near future,
Would it, Mr. Leyden?
You'll like Belgrade.
Such a beautiful city.
The views from the turrets-
You can't imagine.
Magnificent.
See here.
Mr. Peters, a moment ago
You mentioned
a bureau of records in Athens.
Weren't you there
while I was there?
The stout gentleman!
Then it was
no accident
That you were on
the same train,
In the same
compartment,
No accident that
you recommended the hotel.
I've known everything
you've done
Since you left
the record bureau in Athens.
I've already told you
I’m interested in anyone
That's interested
in Dimitrios.
But what on earth is
your great interest in Dimitrios?
Money? He had none.
I saw his body
at the mortuary,
But you're certain-
What's the matter?
Did I understand you
to say
That you actually saw
the body of Dimitrios
In the mortuary?
I said I did.
What do you want?
Take your hands
off me!
Say, you
are insane.
Mr. Leyden,
We must reach
an understanding.
We must stop
this quarreling.
It's absolutely
essential that I know what you're after.
And I want to know-
No, no, no.
Please don't interrupt me.
I admit I probably need
your answers more than you need mine,
But I cannot give you
mine at present.
Then you won't
get mine.
Yes, yes, I heard
what you said,
But I’m talking
seriously.
Listen, please.
If you go to Belgrade,
You will not discover
a single trace of Dimitrios.
Furthermore, you may
find yourself in trouble with the authorities
If you pursue the matter.
There's only one man
who could and would, under certain circumstances,
Tell you what you
want to know.
He lives near Geneva.
Now, then,
I will give you his name,
And I will give you
a letter to him,
But first I must know
why you want this information.
Your passport describes
you as a writer,
But that is
a very elastic term.
Who are you,
Mr. Leyden?
And what is
your game?
I have no game.
Naturally when I ask
what your game is,
I use the phrase
in a specific sense.
Your game is of course
to get money.
But that is not
the answer I mean.
Are you rich,
Mr. Leyden?
Ha.
No. Then what
I have to say may be simplified.
I am proposing
an alliance, Mr. Leyden.
A pooling of
resources.
I am aware of
certain facts
Which I cannot
at the moment tell you about.
You, on the other hand,
Possess an important
piece of information.
You may not know
that it is important,
But nevertheless it is.
Now, my facts alone are
not worth a great deal.
Your piece of
information
Is quite valueless
without my facts.
The two together,
however,
Are worth
at the very least-
At the very least-
A million
French francs.
One million?
What do you say
to that?
You'll forgive me,
Mr. Peters,
But I don't understand
what you're talking about,
Not that it makes
any difference what I do or not,
But... oh,
I think I’m tired.
I'm very tired,
and I want to go to bed.
One million, huh?
No, Mr. Peters.
Well, I suppose
there's no reason
Why I shouldn't
tell you
What my interest
in Dimitrios is,
But it certainly
isn't money.
I make
a decent living.
As you know,
detective stories sell very well.
Detective stories...
Mr. Leyden,
may I use your paper?
Oh, go right ahead.
You used everything else.
Detective stories.
Now, that's most
interesting to me, Mr. Leyden.
I'm so fond of them.
I'm glad you like them.
Well, the first time
I heard about Dimitrios was in Istanbul,
From colonel Haki.
I don't know exactly
how it happened,
But somehow I found
myself trying to trace his strange career.
Why?
Partly for my amusement,
I suppose.
I had nothing better
to do.
Maybe that was why
I was interested in such a colorful character.
I don't expect you
to believe me,
But it's the truth.
If you don't like it,
too bad.
Here, Mr. Leyden,
are 3 pieces of paper.
On the first is written
the name of the man of whom I spoke to you.
The name is Grodek.
He lives just outside Geneva.
The second is
a letter to him.
If you will present
that letter,
He will know that
you are a friend of mine
And that he can
be frank with you.
And incidentally,
It was he who
employed Dimitrios in 1926.
Oh, really?
Uh, what about
this one?
I think you said
you were not rich?
No, I’m not rich.
Half a million
francs...
would be useful
to you?
Well, it wouldn't
make me sad.
Well, then, Mr. Leyden,
when you have tired of Geneva,
I want you to,
how do you say,
To kill two birds
with one stone.
Ahem. Here on
this list of yours are other dates
Besides 1926 still
to be accounted for.
If you are to know
what there is to know about Dimitrios,
The place to account
for them is Paris.
That is the first thing.
The second is if
you will come to Paris,
If you will consider then
the pooling of resources,
The alliance that I have
already proposed to you,
I can definitely
guarantee that in a very few days
You will have at least
a half a million French francs.
At the moment
I cannot say more.
But if you will believe in
and trust me,
If you will come to Paris,
then here on this piece of paper
Is an address.
When you arrive, send
a pneumatique to me.
Do not call, for it is
the address of a friend.
I have put you
to so much trouble.
Oh, no trouble
at all.
I wish to make restitution
in a practical way.
Half a million francs
is worth considering, eh?
And I would guarantee it.
But, uh, we must trust
one another,
That is most important.
Au revoir,
Mr. Leyden.
I won't say good-Bye.
Half a million francs,
Mr. Leyden,
Will buy a lot of
good things.
I do hope we shall meet
in Paris.
Good night.
Ohh...
Mr. Leyden.
Excuse me, monsieur.
I did not hear
the car arrive.
I was playing
my favorite Bach.
Oh, I see that
You have introduced
yourself
To Eloise
and Abelard.
Do you like cats?
Very much.
I love them,
monsieur.
This is Eloise.
Isn't she beautiful?
Oh, beautiful.
And so
inscrutable,
Like a woman.
Ravissante.
Go back to
your lover now.
Won't you sit down,
please?
Yes, thank you.
Very kind of you
to receive me, sir.
Well, I don't know
exactly what Mr. Peters said in his letter.
Mr. Peters was very
frank about you.
Oh, was he?
He said that you
were writing a book.
I, too, am writing
a book.
Oh, really?
Your memoirs?
Oh, no, monsieur.
I am writing
the life of saint Francis.
Pardon me?
Yes, indeed.
But I confidently
expect to be dead
Before it
is finished.
Do you care for
English whiskey?
Yes, I do, very much.
Good. I, too, prefer
it as an aperitif.
Oh, yes. May I have
a cigarette, please?
Please,
help yourself.
Thank you.
Have you known
Mr. Peters long?
No, I...
I met him once
in a train
And then again in
my hotel in Sofia.
Thank you.
Monsieur, I wonder what
your attitude would be
If I were to ask
an impertinent question.
Please,
go right ahead.
If I were, for instance,
to ask you to tell me seriously,
If a literary interest
in human frailty
Were your only reason
for approaching me?
Monsieur,
I can assure you-
I'm quite certain
that you can,
But forgive me,
monsieur.
What are your
assurances worth?
All I can do is
give you my word
That any information
you give me
I'll treat as
confidential.
I don't think
I have made myself quite clear.
The information
itself is nothing.
What happened
in Belgrade in 1926
If of little
importance now.
It's my own position
of which I am thinking.
You see my point?
I'm a little suspicious,
monsieur.
I still have enemies
in this world.
Supposing, therefore,
if you tell me
Just what your relations
with our friend peters are.
Would you like
to do that?
I would, but I can't...
for the simple reason
that I don't know
What our relations
are myself.
I was not joking,
Mr. Leyden.
Nor I.
As you know, sir,
I was investigating
the life of Dimitrios,
And while doing so
I met this Mr. Peters.
Well, for some reason,
I don't know why,
He seemed to be
interested in Dimitrios, too.
He followed me
to Sofia, and there he approached me-
Behind a pistol.
Behind a pistol?
He made me an offer.
Ah.
If I would meet him
in Paris
And collaborate in
some sort of a scheme he had in mind,
We should each profit
to the extent of half a million francs.
I see.
He said that I had some
piece of information in my possession which,
When used
in conjunction with some information
That
he possessed,
Should prove of
great value.
And what may I ask
Is this so valuable
piece of information in your possession?
That's what
I don't know.
Come now, monsieur.
You ask for
my confidences.
The least you can do
is to give me yours.
But it's true.
I don't know.
Well... well, yes,
At one point
in our conversation,
He became
very excited.
At what point?
When I explained
to him how I knew that Dimitrios
Had no money
when he died.
And how
did you know?
Well,
it's very simple.
Because
I saw the body.
You saw the body?
Yes, everything taken
from it was right there on the mortuary table,
But there was
no money, none. Not a single penny.
Another drink,
monsieur?
Oh, yes, please.
You see? I don't
know what
My relations
to Mr. Peters are myself.
Mm-Hmm.
Straight?
Yes, please.
A toast,
monsieur Leyden...
to the detective story.
Thank you, sir.
To your book.
Forgive me, monsieur.
A thought crossed my mind
that made me laugh.
It was a thought
of our friend peters
Confronting you
with a pistol.
You know,
he's quite terrified of firearms.
With me, he kept his fears
to himself very successfully.
A clever man,
peters.
May I be permitted
as a friend
To give you a word of advice,
Mr. Leyden?
- Please do.
- Then, if I were in your place
I should be inclined
to take our friend peters at his word.
- And go to Paris.
- Really?
I think I shall tell you
about Dimitrios.
My friend peters has
probably referred to me
As a master spy.
The term is ambiguous.
Actually it means that I was
an employer of spy labor
That's how I came
to employ Dimitrios.
He was well recommended
for this particular job.
Which I don't mind telling you was on behalf of Italy.
Relations between Italy
and Yugoslavia in 1926
Were a bit strained.
My assignment was to get a copy
of the Yugoslav minefield chart.
And for that job
I employed Dimitrios.
I was in Belgrade myself,
And had ample opportunity
to watch him in action.
I left the whole matter
entirely up to Dimitrios,
But I was interested
to see how he started.
At the time, he was
using the name of Wagner-
Even
Herr Wagner.
Can you direct me
To the department
of supply?
Yes, sir.
Second floor, to your left.
Thank you.
Woman: yes?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I seem to be lost.
Could you direct me to
the department of supply?
It's down the hall
to your right.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Man: you may part
again, Bulic.
I hope you'll be
luckier this time.
If I have the cards,
I am lucky,
If I don't have
the cards, I’m unlucky.
Go away.
Why?
Last night, every time
you whistled a love song,
He led a heart.
Go away, please.
But I only-
Oh, excuse me-
I'm a stranger
in Belgrade,
But I played bezique
in Germany,
And I’m wondering if
you play it the same way in this country.
Bezique is bezique.
I like it better
than the German pinochle.
Oh, I, too.
My patriotism doesn't go
as far as the cards.
May I buy you a drink...
all of you gentlemen?
Man: a free
drink? Why not?
Of course.
Come join us.
Thank you.
Waiter, a drink
for all of us.
Yes, sir.
Dimitrios: my firm,
the Dresden optical company,
Has a bid in for
the sale of 10,000 pairs of binoculars.
Binoculars.
The order would mean
a great deal.
I understand that,
But surely you don't
expect me-
For 20,000 dinar?
That's
a lot of money.
But I’m afraid
you overestimate my importance
In the government.
In any event,
I have no influence
With the department
of supply,
Who pass this on
to people.
But you probably know
the right official.
You fellows stick
together.
True, true...
20,000 dinar...
yes?
Do you think I could
see Mr. Druhar for a moment?
You work down
the hall, don't you?
I'm afraid I don't
know your name.
Bulic. Karel Bulic.
Oh, I suppose it's
all right. Go on in.
Well, what is it?
Mr. Druhar, I was wondering
if, uh... I mean...
about these optical bids.
What about them?
What about them.
I just-I have a friend of mine...
I just wondered if
you would tell me
When the announcement
of the awards would be made.
I don't know
why you should be interested,
But if it does you
any good to know,
The list
will be posted this afternoon.
Oh, thank you
very much, I...
hey, Bulic,
you are late.
A packet of pachas.
Bulic.
Bulic my friend.
Oh, Herr Wagner,
I am so sorry.
I have very bad news.
I have very
good news for you.
My firm was awarded
the contract for the binoculars.
I owe it all to you.
The award was made
to Nanovic & company of Czechoslovakia.
Our Czech subsidiary.
Subsidiary?
Yes. We put
in two bids:
One for our parent
company in Germany
And the other for
our subsidiary much lower.
Much lower.
Here's the money
I promised you:
20,000 dinar.
20,000 dinar.
My wife...
now I can buy her
all those things I wanted.
Of course you can.
We must have a celebration.
You and your wife
will be my guests this evening.
Oh, Herr Bulic.
Who is it?
Karel.
Oh, it's you.
Well, come in.
I can't
open the door.
Hello, Anna, darling.
Look what I brought
for you.
The most wonderful thing
has happened to me.
Come here. Look.
Ooh!
Look.
But that's nothing.
Look.
Oh, Karel,
it's beautiful.
That's nothing.
Look.
No, no.
That's for me.
Karel, they gave you
a raise in salary.
No, something
much more wonderful has happened to me.
Where did you
get that money? You didn't steal it?
No. I did a slight service
for a friend of mine.
I helped him to get
a government contract, and he paid me 20,000 dinar.
20,000 dinar.
You see,
I’m not the little unimportant nobody
Whom you always
thought I were.
From now on,
there'll be no more of this
Because your husband
will get the best for you...
because I love you.
I love you so much.
Now, see how fast
you can get ready.
We go out for dinner.
Oh, where?
A very expensive place.
A friend of mine,
Herr Wagner.
Darling, it won't
take me a minute.
To Madame.
Thank you.
I've lived in Belgrade
all my life,
But I’ve never been to
a place like this.
Madame, you should
come here more often.
You're the most beautiful
woman in the place.
Oh, you lucky fellow,
every man in the place is looking at Madame.
Me, too.
That distinguished-Looking
gentleman over there
Is the Freiherr
von Kissling.
Terribly rich.
Controls as many as 27 companies.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Of course.
Herr Wagner,
is it not?
Why, Herr von Kissling,
this is indeed a pleasure.
Madame Bulic,
may I present the Freiherr von Kissling?
How do you do?
And my very good friend,
Herr Bulic.
How do you do,
Herr Bulic?
Herr Bulic is
an important official in the Yugoslav government,
A pleasure,
Herr Bulic.
I beg your pardon.
It is indeed
a great pleasure, sir.
Anna: why,
Herr von Kissling,
Why don't
you join us?
May I?
Of course.
Thank you.
Waiter, another
bottle of champagne.
Please sit down.
Bulic: thank you.
Herr Bulic,
you must forgive me
For forcing myself
upon your company.
From my own table,
I could not resist admiring Madame.
I presumed that
on my acquaintance with Herr Wagner...
I consider it
a compliment.
Madame, I wonder if
you would be so kind as
To dance with
an old man.
Oh, I haven't
danced in so long.
And I am old
and clumsy.
The Freiherr is taken
with your wife,
And I must say
I can't blame him.
You should take her
to these places more often.
Isn't she beautiful?
I can't afford it.
Well, my dear Bulic,
you forget you've just earned 20,000 dinar,
And that's only
the beginning.
Regardless,
the Freiherr likes you.
I can tell by
his expression.
He's famous for
associating with in-Men whom he likes.
He doubtless has
a company or two right here in Yugoslavia.
Madame is
a divine dancer.
Karel, I’m having
so much fun tonight.
Freiherr: miss.
Will you
permit me?
Orchid.
The first
I’ve ever had.
It's
so beautiful.
It's hardly beautiful
enough for you.
Oh, may I?
Wagner: that's rather
a large amount of money
To carry with you, Freiherr.
Isn't it
a little dangerous?
Perhaps. I don't usually
carry so much with me.
As a matter of fact,
I won this money in Werner's room.
Do you know
about Werner?
He has the back room.
He's quite
the most reliable gambler in Belgrade.
In Werner's,
it's your own luck
And not the croupier's
skill that counts.
From the look of that,
you've been very lucky.
Quite, in every way.
Since you've never
been in Werner's,
I shall be delighted
if you would accompany me there.
But we've
never gambled...
you may enjoy
watching me win.
Perhaps you will
bring me more luck.
Herr Bulic, I have
been thinking.
I wonder if you could
have luncheon with me one day this week.
Yes! Ahem.
Oh, yes
It is possible that we
can discuss something to our mutual advantage.
Mutual-Yes.
Yes.
Now, shall
we try our luck?
Herr Wagner, I’ve never
gambled for money.
Oh, my dear Bulic,
suppose you lose a few hundred dinar.
There's really no need
to concern yourself over so paltry a sum.
The Freiherr has
already expressed an interest in you,
And that means
your fortune is made.
But, Herr Wagner...
please don't
disappoint him
By showing yourself
less important than you seem to be now.
Important...
I see...
croupier:
rouge et pair.
We have won.
Let's leave it there.
Should we risk
it all?
Of course.
Herr Bulic,
play red with us.
I rather play black.
We have won again.
Oh, but Karel
has lost.
Herr Bulic is
an individualist.
Let's take
a big chance.
Let's leave it
all red.
All right.
That's mine,
3 blues on red.
Oh, we shouldn't
have played it all.
We cannot win every time.
Yes, but Karel
hasn't won yet.
5,000 please.
40,000 dinar.
I must have
been mad.
It's nothing,
Herr Bulic.
You'll win another time.
Freiherr, will you take
Madame back to our table
While Herr Bulic
and I settle things with the management?
Of course.
We shall have a good dinner now...
and then
some more champagne.
Yes?
Man on intercom:
Bulic lost 40. Owe 20,000.
All right.
Herr Wagner.
Herr Werner.
I see you have given us
back a little of the money you won the other night,
Both you and
the Freiherr von Kissling.
Don't worry, Werner.
We'll win it again and more another time.
Very likely.
You are Herr Bulic.
Very unfortunate that
you should lose so heavily your first time here.
Herr Bulic is
a very dear friend of mine, Werner.
At the moment he is
unable to make good
The notes he signed
during the excitement of play.
Oh? When, may I ask,
can you pay?
I don't know.
Never.
Oh, come now.
You don't look like the sort
Who'd gamble in a casino
and not pay his losses.
I am not.
I had 20,000 dinar.
It's all gone.
I haven't any money.
I don't know how to get it.
I would help
Herr Bulic if I could,
But unfortunately,
I have exceeded my expense account.
Perhaps the Freiherr
could help you out.
Oh, no, no.
Well, it seems that
I shall be compelled to take steps.
Who's your employer?
No, please.
That won't due,
Werner.
Herr Bulic is
an official of the government.
It would mean
dismissal.
Well, I’m not
interested-
Well, now wait.
Perhaps I can
help Herr Bulic after all.
Can you give us
24 hours?
24 hours.
Very well.
If you say so, Herr Wagner.
24 hours.
Herr Bulic.
Thank you
very much.
Herr Wagner...
my wife...
oh, we'll say nothing
of this to Madame.
We'll let her believe
that everything's agreeable.
Tomorrow we'll
talk this all over. It won't be so difficult.
You will help me,
won't you?
Trust me,
my friend.
Yes?
Thank you.
Bulic?
Yes. He has taken
our little hint.
Why, Herr Bulic.
Werner telephoned
me at the office.
Why would he do that?
He said he wanted
to check up on me.
I have no privacy
at the ministry.
He must not telephone
me there again.
Of course.
He shouldn't embarrass you.
A drink?
No, thank you.
Well, Herr Bulic,
I think I can help you.
You can?
Oh, if you could
get me out of this frightful situation,
I'll be in
your debt forever.
I'll never gamble
another dinar.
I spoke by telephone
to my principles.
They're very
grateful to you for your assistance
With the binocular
contract.
They gave me permission
to make another arrangement with you.
Any assistance
I can give.
But it won't be time.
Werner said tonight.
Well, let's see.
You owe Werner
20,000 dinar.
What would you say
to 50,000 dinar by this evening?
By this evening?
I can get the money
for you from the Eurasian credit trust,
Provided you
fulfill your part of the bargain.
Herr Wagner,
I’d do anything, anything.
In your office
is a chart,
A chart of
the proposed minefields of the Otranto straits.
You'll bring it
to me this evening.
You dirty spy.
The only risk
you take is in not doing as you're told.
You're quite sure
he'll come?
I'm positive of it.
The only thing I’m
not positive of is the 50,000 francs
You're to pay me
for this job.
You'll see the money
the moment I get the chart.
And here, my friend,
are your 50,000 francs.
Thank you, Grodek.
Now you'll lay
your camera on the table
And place your hands
behind your head.
You, too, Werner.
Turn around.
I know
you're ambitious,
But you certainly
cannot expect to get away with this.
Why not?
The chart's worth
50,000 francs to you.
It's probably worth
twice that amount to the Italian government.
Besides, Werner's getting
your money back from Bulic.
Dimitrios,
you can't.
I can.
I can do anything.
No, no, Werner.
The scoundrel.
Incredible.
And then did you let him
get away with the chart?
He sold it to
another government.
But it didn't do
them any good.
The Yugoslavs learned
that the chart had been stolen.
Naturally, they made
an entire new plat immediately,
And Dimitrios' buyers
paid out their money for nothing.
But so did you.
Not exactly.
I gave Italy
her money's worth.
There was no
difficulty obtaining the new Yugoslav chart,
Without Bulic's
assistance, of course.
Poor, confused
little man.
He put a bullet
through his head.
Oh, terrible.
My dear Leyden,
Bulic was a traitor.
One cannot
sentimentalize over traitors.
I know, he was
an honest man fundamentally,
But it was all
too much for him.
In the end,
his innate honesty got the best of him.
He gave the 50,000 dinar
to his wife,
Then he went to
the ministry and told them what he had done.
After that,
there was nothing left except to kill himself.
It is at times
like those, monsieur,
That one needs
one's sense of humor.
Well, Mr. Leyden,
don't you think you should go to Paris?
How could I resist... now?
Entree.
Mr. Leyden,
I was so glad to get your letter.
Oh, you're knocking
at doors now.
Quite an improvement, sir.
Quite an improvement.
My dear Mr. Leyden,
I cannot tell you how pleased I am to see you.
Welcome to Paris.
Have you had
a good journey? You're looking well.
Grodek wrote,
telling me
How charming and
sympathetic you were.
Good fellow, isn't he?
Those cats of his
he worships.
Yes. They are beautiful,
and his whiskey's excellent.
Oh, he wanted to know what
business I had with you.
As I don't know,
I felt I safely could confide in him.
By the way, do you
have your pistol with you?
Dear me, no,
Mr. Leyden.
Why should I bring
such a thing on a friendly visit to you?
Well, you've been
known to do it.
Look here, Mr. Peters.
I'd hate to be impolite
with a professional gentleman like yourself,
But there is a limit
even to my patience.
I've traveled
a long way to see you, and I want to know why.
So you shall.
I've heard that before.
Before you start beating
about the bush again,
There are one or two things
that you should know.
I'm not a violent man,
Mr. Peters.
As a matter of fact,
I hate violence,
But there are times when
the most peace-loving simply must do it,
And this may be
one of them.
I know who you are.
Your name is not peters.
It's Peterson-Eric Peterson.
I also know that you were
a member of a smuggling gang organized by Dimitrios.
I know you were
arrested in December 1931 and fined 2,000 francs.
You were sentenced to prison
for one month, correct?
Did Grodek
tell you this?
No. I took the liberty of
going to the library yesterday,
And what do I find
in our newspaper files?
This little picture.
Ah, yes. A newspaper.
I could not believe my friend Grodek-
Well, then
you don't deny it?
Oh no,
it is the truth.
Well, then
Mr. Peterson...
Peters, Mr. Leyden.
I decided to change the name.
All right,
peters.
I agree with you, sir.
Peters is a much nicer name.
When I was in Istanbul,
I heard some very interesting things
About the end
of those smugglers.
Somebody there said that
Dimitrios betrayed all of you.
Sent a dossier to the police,
I think, anonymously.
Is that true?
Dimitrios behaved very badly
to us all.
I was also told that
there was talk of vengeance.
That all of you threatened to
kill Dimitrios, as soon as you were free.
- Is that true?
- I did not threaten.
Some of the others did so.
Constantine Gullus, for example
was always a hothead.
Oh, I see.
You didn't threaten.
You preferred to act.
I don't understand you,
Mr. Leyden.
No...
let me put it to you this way.
I'm just wondering...
wouldn't it be reasonable to suppose
that you killed Dimitrios for his money?
I think you
are very indiscreet...
am I?
And very fortunate.
Just suppose I had,
as you suggest, killed Dimitrios.
Think what I should
be forced to do.
I should be forced
to kill you also, now, shouldn't I?
There it is.
I knew it.
I knew it.
You see, I lied to you
a moment ago. I admit it.
I was so curious to know
what you were going to do
If you thought
I was unarmed.
You understand my feelings
a little?
So anxious to have
your confidence.
All of which is
as clever a reply
To an accusation
of murder as one could wish for.
Mr. Leyden, this is
not a detective story.
Even if you
cannot be discreet,
At least use
your imagination.
Is it likely that
Dimitrios would make a will in my favor? No.
Then how do you suppose
I could kill him for his money?
People in these days
Do not keep their wealth
in treasure chests.
Come now, Mr. Leyden.
Let us please
be sensible.
Let us have
dinner together,
And after,
talk business.
You probably
disapprove of me.
I really cannot
blame you.
But let us at least
cultivate an illusion of friendship.
I could think of a lot
of reasons why I shouldn't have dinner with you.
Just the same, I will,
But let me warn you,
unless I have this evening
A satisfactory explanation
for your asking me to come to Paris,
I shall,
half a million francs or no half a million francs,
Leave by the first
available train.
Is that clear?
Couldn't be clearer,
Mr. Leyden.
And may I say
how much I appreciate your frankness.
All right.
Where shall we dine?
There's a Romanian
place near here.
And afterwards,
we'll go to my apartment for coffee.
Thank you.
Excellent dinner.
Now for coffee.
What about Mr. Godfrey?
He's away. At the moment,
I’m in sole possession.
I see.
Peters:
you conclude, I suppose, that I am Godfrey?
Mm-Hmm.
Thank you.
Peters:
do you like it?
Well, it's
rather unusual.
Actually, just another
uncomfortable French house.
Immanently an oasis
in a desert of discomfort.
Leyden: heh heh.
Dimitrios furnished it.
Dimitrios?
Yes.
He bought this house and the two adjoining.
There are secret doors
leading from one house to another.
In case of police raids,
you know?
Thank you.
Leyden:
aren't you, uh, a little indiscreet living here?
Oh, no. You see,
Dimitrios bought the houses originally in my name.
After my incarceration,
I sold them quite legally to a monsieur Godfrey.
Uh-Huh.
Do you like Algerian
coffee, Mr. Leyden?
Pardon me? Yes.
It takes a little
longer to prepare it, but I prefer it.
Oh, by the way,
do you recognize him, Mr. Leyden?
Why yes, certainly,
it's Dimitrios.
What about it?
You recognize him.
Good.
That, Mr. Leyden,
is a photograph of Constantine Gullus.
Gullus?
Gullus...
what on earth
do you mean?
What you saw on the mortuary
slab in Istanbul, Mr. Leyden,
Was Gullus after he tried
to put certain ideas about Dimitrios into practice.
I saw the body
of Dimitrios with my own eyes.
You saw the body
of Gullus, Mr. Leyden,
After Dimitrios
had killed him.
Dimitrios himself,
I am glad to say, is alive and in good health.
Dimitrios alive.
No, no.
It isn't possible.
I saw his name
inside the coat:
Dimitrios
Makropoulos.
It was a French
identification card.
French
identification card.
Ha ha ha!
That I find amusing.
Ha ha ha!
I could get you a dozen
genuine identification cards, Mr. Leyden,
And each in the name
of Dimitrios Makropoulos.
I guess you could.
He's alive...
but where is he?
Here, in Paris.
You've been
very reasonable, Mr. Leyden,
I shall tell you
everything.
As you may imagine,
we were all very angry with Dimitrios.
Some of us
threatened revenge.
I became a wanderer,
Mr. Leyden.
A little business here,
a little business there,
Travel and meditation,
that was my life.
I met Gullus in Rome.
He told me that he was
on the track of Dimitrios.
Asked me to lend him
3,000 francs to conclude his search.
I gave it to him.
With that money, Gullus went to Paris.
Well, sir,
he found Dimitrios
Living in a big home
under an assumed name, a rich man.
Gullus intended
to kill Dimitrios, but his nerve failed him.
He settled for blackmail.
That was his mistake.
Dimitrios took him
on a cruise to Istanbul.
There, he stabbed him,
Put a false
identification card in his clothing,
And tossed him
into the Bosporus.
A bloated corpse washed up by the sea.
I think you're guessing.
How could you know?
You weren't there.
Ha! But you forget
the 3,000 francs I loaned Gullus.
He sent it to me
in Paris with a note
Saying he was
going on an Aegean cruise with Dimitrios.
I decided to meet
him in Istanbul,
But when I got there,
it was too late.
The only thing left for me
was to try and find out
Those things about Dimitrios
that Gullus had known.
Then, Mr. Leyden,
our paths began to cross.
Mmm.
Well, now that
you've found him, what next?
Come now, Mr. Leyden,
surely you are not as obtuse as all this.
You alone can prove
that the man buried in Istanbul is not Dimitrios., *
If necessary,
you can identify
Gullus' photographs
on the police files.
I, on the other hand,
know where to find Dimitrios.
Our joint silence
will be worth a lot of money to him.
With Gullus'
fate in mind,
We should know, too,
how to deal with the matter.
We should demand
a million francs.
Dimitrios would pay,
believing we would come back for more,
But we shall not be as
foolish as to endanger our lives in that way.
We'll rest content
with half a million each, Mr. Leyden,
And quietly disappear.
Blackmail on
a cash basis.
You really expect me
to agree to this plan of yours, Mr. Peters?
I don't think I quite
understand, Mr. Leyden.
If this is
a clumsy trick...
it is no trick,
clumsy or otherwise.
You see, I’m quite
prepared in assisting blackmailing a person
If that person is Dimitrios,
But I’m not prepared
to share in the profits.
So much the better
for you, isn't it?
Mr. Leyden,
you are kind.
There's not enough
kindness in the world.
Not that again!
Not that
"kindness in the world"!
It's coming
out of my ears.
But you are kind.
I prepared a letter
for Dimitrios,
Asking him
to meet with us.
"Dear sir,
the undersigned has just learned
That he is an old
acquaintance of yours dating back to 1929... "
"And would appreciate
having a little chat with you."
"I'm sure that you
will find the talk immensely interesting."
"Kindly come to
the Ledru hotel, avenue Ledru,
"Tomorrow evening
at 8:00.
"Looking forward
to seeing you.
I remain your old
friend and associate, Eric Peterson."
P.S.
Oh, yes.
"I have just learned
of the passing
"Of our mutual friend,
Constantine Gullus.
Regrettable."
Do you think he'll come?
Most certainly.
How much?
4.
I have it.
All right.
My name is
Mr. Peterson.
I made reservation
by telephone.
Oh, yes. It will be
15 francs for one, 20 for two.
This gentlemen is
not staying with me.
15 francs.
Thank you.
Up the stairs,
down the hall, to your right.
I don't like this,
Mr. Peters,
I don't like it.
What's to
prevent Dimitrios
From coming up
here and shooting us both?
Please, do not let
your imagination run away with you.
Dimitrios would
not do that.
It would be too noisy
and dangerous for him.
Besides,
that is not his way.
Leyden: it isn't?
Well, what is his way?
He's a very
cautious man.
He thinks carefully
before he acts.
Well, he got
the letter this morning.
He had all day
to think carefully.
I had weeks.
I tell you
I know Dimitrios.
I know how
his mind works.
I am asking
a million francs,
That is not
an exorbitant amount for Dimitrios.
He will pay.
I will take
the money
And go instantly
to the Indies,
Where Dimitrios
will never find me.
That's fine for you.
What about me?
I don't feel like
instantly going to the Indies.
You have glasses?
Put them on.
Put on
your hat, too.
Oh, I see. Yes.
Turn up the collar
of your coat.
Yeah, that's
a good idea.
Sit in that corner
where it will not be too light.
Yeah, that's better.
Good. That'll do it.
My good friend,
how are you?
How are you?
That is Mr. Smith.
Mr. Smith.
He knew Gullus?
That is what
we wanted to talk to you about, Dimitrios.
Then talk. I've
an appointment to keep.
You haven't changed
at all, Dimitrios, always impetuous,
Always a little unkind.
After all these years,
no word of greeting,
No word of regret
for all the unhappiness you've caused me.
I have an appointment
to keep.
Since you want to make this
a purely business matter,
We want money.
What do you have to
give me in exchange?
Silence, Dimitrios,
Very valuable.
How valuable?
One million francs.
What do you think
you know that's worth one million francs?
So difficult to know
where to begin.
There are so many things
the police would like to know.
For instance,
the identity of the man
Who tipped them off in 1931
to the smuggling ring.
I'm sure they'd be
interested to know that it is the same man
Who today is a director of
the Eurasian credit trust.
You haven't told
me anything yet
That's worth
one million francs.
It's childish.
You were always
inclined to despise
My simple approach
to the problems of this life,
But our silence
on the matter
Would be worth something,
would it not?
Not one million francs.
There's Yugoslavia.
Police of that country
would be glad to know
The whereabouts
of Dimitrios Talat.
So Grodek's
been talking.
Any more?
Then let us go to Smyrna.
In 1922, a moneylender
named Conrad-
The murderer of
Conrad was hanged.
Can that be true?
Perhaps Mr. Smith has
something to add to that.
Abdul Dhris was hanged,
But he made a confession
implicating a man named Dimitrios Makropoulos.
Mr. Smith saw
the body of Gullus
And had no difficulty
in identifying it with a photograph of Gullus.
Do you really think
a million is exorbitant?
I'm wondering why
you ask so little.
I do not like
to be greedy.
I like to be fair...
always.
You'll have it ready
in" mille notes tomorrow.
If the instructions are
not followed out exactly,
You'll not be given
a second chance.
Do you understand?
Mr. Smith?
Yes?
How is this man whom you
took to be Gullus dressed when he was found?
Oh, in a cheap
blue suit,
And inside
the coat there was an identification card.
And how was
he killed?
He was stabbed in
the side and thrown into the water.
Peters:
are you satisfied, Dimitrios?
What did you
think of him?
It's Dimitrios,
all right.
Ruthless and primitive.
I was frightened.
Dimitrios has that
effect on people.
You frighten me.
I always knew
you hated Dimitrios,
But I didn't know
you hated him so much.
Not until I saw him
in this room.
Then I knew I hated
him enough to kill him.
I knew it!
What?
Listen, the trains.
I spent an hour
in here this morning listening to them.
The Ballard rail.
Be ready.
Come.
One million francs.
Did you ever see
so much money at one time before?
One million-
Beautiful thing, oh!
Leyden: is there
a match somewhere?
Dimitrios:
little surprised, Peterson?
I'm glad your friend
smith is here, too.
It saves me the trouble
of persuading you to give me his name and address.
Peterson was always
too ingenious,
And ingenuity is
never a substitute for intelligence.
He was my friend.
No, he wasn't
my friend,
But he was
a nice man.
Compared to you
he was-
You rotten,
insane brute!
Leyden: you think
you can go on murdering people like that?!
You murderer, you!
You get up!
Leyden: let me go, you!
So help me!
Aah!
Peters: not him!
Leave him alone!
Peters: go, Leyden.
Go.
You go!
But I better-
Something has to be done.
I'll call the police
or something.
Dimitrios: wait! Wait!
Don't go!
Don't go!
Come back!
Or do you want this carrion
to kill me?
Come back!
I am very happy
it is you!
Are you all right?
Put that money away!
That's all
you ever wanted, isn't it?
I don't want it now.
I don't want it somehow.
I've done what
I had to do.
But-But what's
going to happen?
Something's going
to happen.
You'll be glad to know
I killed
Dimitrios Makropoulos.
You wanted to
write a book.
Write it.
Send me a copy.
I'll have a lot
of time to read it where I’m going.
Good-Bye, Mr. Peters.
Au revoir.
Sorry you won't be able
to go to the Indies now.
You see, there's
not enough kindness in the world.
