They're human, yet
they have abilities...
beyond those of ordinary men.
Witches, sorcerers,
shape-shifters...
...the Others are as varied
as stars in the sky.
The Others are soldiers
in the eternal war:
The struggle between
Dark and Light.
Light Others protected mankind
from the Dark Others...
...who plagued and
tortured humans.
Legend tells of a day...
when the two armies
met on a bridge.
Geser, lord of the Light...
...and Zavulon, general
of the Darkness,
faced each other.
And neither one would give way.
And so began a great battle...
...bloody and merciless.
Zavulon gloried in the slaughter.
But Lord Geser wept.
As the screams of the dying
reached heaven...
...Geser realized the armies
were equally matched...
...and he knew that unless
the fighting stopped...
...every last soul would perish.
So he stopped the battle.
Thus, the forces of
Light and Darkness...
forged a truce.
Geser spoke for the Light...
...and Zavulon spoke
for the Darkness.
And these things were agreed:
No one could be forced
to good or evil...
without choosing freely.
The soldiers of Light
would be called Night Watch...
...making sure Dark Others
obeyed the truce.
And the soldiers of
Darkness would...
be called Day Watch,
to do the same.
And so the balance would be kept
for centuries to come.
But one day, an
Other would come...
...more powerful
than any before him.
Like all Others, he
would have to choose...
between Light and Dark.
And his choice would
change the balance forever.
Hi. I'm here about your ad.
Did you bring a picture?
Yes.
Hold on a sec.
Here.
- Let me see it.
Come inside.
It's messy in here,
go on into the kitchen.
Have a seat, son. Take it easy.
You don't mind that I call you son,
do you?
You're all like sons to me.
Look, here's what happened...
I know what happened...
...Anton.
You loved her, married her...
...and then two days ago,
she packs her bags...
...and leaves you for another man.
See? I know everything.
The women in my
family have the gift.
Don't worry, I'll fix
your little problem.
Look, I just don't get it...
What's not to get?
She's pregnant, you know.
Pregnant.
And the baby's not yours.
It's no problem to get her back...
...but the baby will pull her away
from you, to the real father.
And destroying an innocent child...
...is a great sin.
- Is that so?
Oh, yes.
So you're saying to
get my wife back...
...we need to kill an unborn child...
It's easy.
I'll just clap my hands, like this...
...and it will die, she'll miscarry.
But you must
take the sin upon yourself.
Well, I don't know...
- Will you? Take it?
The sin?
- The sin.
Yeah, sure.
- Let's shake?
What the hell.
Don't worry. It won't hurt.
We just...
...mix everything up.
Lemonade?
Don't worry.
Drink this. Don't worry,
everything's sterile with me.
Are you kidding? It's...
Are the ingredients important?
Or the effect?
The effect.
- Then drink it.
Go ahead.
What's the matter?
I can't be with you.
Good boy.
Now we have to take
care of the brat.
No.
Stop.
Stop.
No.
Sit still, witch.
Get her hands. Don't let her clap.
Get her hands.
Help me, Mashenka.
Hurry, stupid doll.
Get away. Get away from me.
Don't let her clap...
Tiger Cub.
Help. Help, somebody.
Fucking cops. Using live bait.
Let's just fill out the report, okay?
I'm not guilty.
Whatever. Tell it to the judge.
Daria Leonidovna...
...you stand accused
of violating the truce...
...Article 13, Paragraph B:
'Conspiracy and premeditated
attempt to assassinate.'
Job and position?
I'm a gardener.
Oh, yeah?
You got a gardener's license?
Sure.
Someone gave you a
license for that?
Who are you people?
He can see us?
He can now.
He's an Other.
Come to me.
Come.
Come. I'm waiting.
You sure he's an Other?
Yeah, look, he's a seer.
A seer?
Just what we need.
Another asshole
with visions of the future.
Visions?
What do you mean, 'visions'?
Don't get any ideas.
You're not playing the lotto
or anything.
Visions can't be controlled.
Why is it so dark?
You've slipped into the Gloom.
It's a place only Others can go.
I don't understand.
Everything's so different.
- Don't worry.
The world hasn't changed.
Just you.
Anton Gorodetsky.
We'll show you the
proper techniques...
for using live bait...
...such as minnows
and night crawlers...
Yes.
We got it.
Already?
There's not much time,
it's almost dark.
It's going to be cold tonight.
Dress warm.
They're using the Call
to lure the victim to them.
We've traced it to
the orange subway...
line, but that's as far as we got.
You'll have to track them
on foot from there.
You have to get on
the same frequency as the victim.
Hear what he hears.
Feel the Call, like he does.
Can you feel it yet?
No.
- You will.
A victim hearing the Call will have...
high blood pressure,
and may bleed.
The Call puts him in
a sort of trance.
He doesn 't think about where he's...
going, he just knows
he has to get there.
Any signs he sees along the way...
...he tells himself
they're instructions.
Anything he hears,
he takes for an order.
What do you want? Go away.
Where?
Don 't let him out of your sight.
Understand?
I got it.
Don 't forget your weapon.
Got it.
And use the right
light bulb this time.
You'll know you've
found the victim...
...when you hear the Call
as clear as he does.
If you're not feeling it yet...
...try another swig of the red stuff.
I'm out of the shit.
Need me to get more?
No, I'll handle it.
Anton.
What are you doing
up at this hour?
Just let me get dressed.
Hi, neighbor.
Hey, Pop.
I told you not to bring anyone here.
He's cool.
It's still warm.
Is it pig's?
Pig's blood is almost
exactly like human's.
They even use pigs' organs
for transplant these days.
'They' who?
Humans.
We like you very much, Anton.
Who?
- Our family.
Me and Kostya.
Why did you bring him here?
Because he's turned
into one of us.
No, Kostya. He's a Light Other,
one of the Night Watch.
They drink blood
under only one condition:
When they hunt vampires like us.
Bear.
Bear.
- What?
He still hasn't
called? Try him again.
He's not picking up.
Why not?
Fine. I'll call him again.
Where the hell is he?
Underground, probably.
Must be.
I'm waiting.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Come now.
You feel like shit, huh?
I feel like chewing
your fucking ear off.
Don't you push me.
What's wrong with you?
Quit shoving.
Wearing sunglasses indoors,
screeching like a lunatic.
Get a job.
Sorry.
Come.
I'm waiting.
You. Let's see some ID.
Anton Gorodetsky.
Take off your shades.
Have you been drinking?
Just blood.
Drunk on blood.
Drunk, all right.
Drunk and disorderly.
Freeze.
Grab him.
What the fuck you been drinking?
Get the hell out of here.
Come to me.
Got your location. Cold Street.
What's the address?
Anton?
What's wrong?
Anton, don 't switch
the phone off...
Let's move.
I gotta drop some pounds.
Go on. Drink him.
I can't do it.
Wait. Come here.
Do it.
Boy? Where are you?
This is Night Watch.
Step out of the Gloom now.
Take the cross-town, it's faster...
- You wanna drive?
Simeon, stop, it's red.
Run, boy.
Using live bait, pig?
No live bait. Just me.
Andrei.
My teeth.
Sorry.
Hello? Anton?
Did you get the address?
Twelve.
What was that?
- Number 12.
No, he said '10.'
- Ask him again.
Andrei. Stop it.
Let him go. Andrei. No.
Zavulon. It's Zavulon.
Andrei, let him go.
Where are you?
I don't want to hurt you.
Come out of the Gloom.
I told you it was number 12,
but you wouldn't listen.
Get him in the truck.
It's the Day Watch.
Your colleague is charged with
the unlawful use of deadly force.
Did he say something?
I can't hear a thing
over the truck engine.
Sorry, we've got an emergency.
You might want to
move that nice car.
We wouldn't want to
accidentally run over it.
See you.
City Light Company. This is Geser.
It kind of went bad, sir.
Bad?
- He killed one vampire.
The female escaped.
- Is he all right?
You know how many number 12's
there are on Cold Street?
Yes, yes, is he all right?
Bring him to me right away.
CITY LIGHT COMPANY
On my desk.
Now.
All right, all of you out...
...right now. Go on.
Every Night Watch officer...
...must be proficient in combat.
I don't need my people...
...dying...
...or killing anyone else.
You should have gone
into the Gloom...
...arrested the vampire.
Not smashed him to bits.
But everyone's acting crazy lately.
Dark and Light, breaking the rules.
It's like something's in the air.
I saw...
Go ahead. Tell me.
On the metro.
A woman.
Young? Pretty?
Not what I mean.
What?
The vortex.
Damnation.
The vortex.
I saw it, over her.
Listen carefully, Anton.
You have to take me there.
Take me there.
Tell me.
Quit shoving.
It was on the metro.
Don't you push me.
There was a girl...
...a vortex over her head.
I turned the UV on her.
I thought she was a vampire.
But she was something worse.
It's all right.
It's all right, Anton, come back.
Did you see her?
Yes.
Remarkable.
Analytical department.
Emergency meeting.
And check the weather forecast...
...for anything unusual
over the city...
in the next 24 hours.
Gotcha.
TORNADO WARNING
FOR MOSCOW.
LEGENDS OF BYZANTIUM
She's the Virgin, the girl you saw.
Long ago, when the
world was young...
there was a virgin in Byzantium.
She was a good woman,
pure and kind...
...and someone cursed her.
Wherever she went,
misfortune followed.
When she held a
candle, it went out.
If she petted a puppy, it died.
When a bird ate from her hand,
it dropped to the ground.
In houses she visited,
children died.
The force of the curse opened
a vortex of damnation around her.
And with it, the first forces of
Darkness were born into the world.
Warriors of Light
rose up to fight them...
...and the great battle between
Light and Dark began.
All because one
human cursed another.
Legend says that one
day the Virgin...
shall again appear.
Again she shall be cursed...
...but this time her
appearance heralds...
the last battle.
For when the Virgin
returns, the final...
battle between good
and evil shall begin...
...and the balance
will be broken forever.
The Great Other will
appear. If he takes...
the side of Light,
Light will triumph.
But wise men say he will
choose the Darkness.
For it is easier for
a man to destroy...
the Light inside himself...
...than to defeat the Darkness
all around him.
The prophecy is coming true.
It's begun.
Zavulon?
Put Alice on.
It's Zavulon.
Sounds serious.
I'm kind of busy right now.
They killed the hairstylist.
- What?
Andrei. Busted his
head open on a sink.
You know what to do.
- I'm on it.
We need to find Andrei's girlfriend.
The one with the burned face.
When did she turn?
Night Watch licensed Andrei
to bite her.
She was so in love with him...
...she didn 't even run.
Young, beautiful, reckless,
you know the type.
Anyway, Andrei ate her
like a midnight snack.
Now he's dead and she's starving.
Then this will be easy.
Give it to me.
- You want it bad, don't you?
Give it to me.
Andrei taught you
how to use the Call.
He did. Give it to me.
You were the one
who called the boy.
Do it again.
And when he's in your hands...
...demand to see the one
who killed your Andrei.
My Andrei. Please give it to me.
Give me.
You want revenge, don't you?
Please. Please.
- Don't torture her.
She'll sure as hell
find the brat now.
How?
She'll sniff him out
like a starving dog.
Where are you going?
I have to find him.
Find who?
The boy.
What do you think
you're going to do?
You're barely alive.
Your glimpses of the future
aren't enough for fieldwork.
Drinking blood, hunting...
...you're not cut out for it.
That's not the point.
What is?
We license Dark Others ourselves.
So?
Then we use innocent
humans as live...
bait, to catch them
breaking the truce.
Says who?
Says me.
I'm saying it.
You don't understand.
You sit in this office...
...you don't understand anything.
He's just a little boy.
A child.
To her, he's like a glass of water
in the desert...
...torn from her hand
before she could take a sip.
If I don't find him, she will.
And she'll suck him dry.
Wait.
I'll give you a partner.
You killed a Dark Other, Anton.
Zavulon won't forgive you for that.
You need protection.
What's that?
It's Olga.
She'll help you.
What the fuck is this?
Suit yourself.
Owls are known for
their merciless killing instincts.
Every Other has to choose...
...Light or Dark.
Which one are you?
Which one are you?
I'm not a killer.
I didn't want him to die.
Find out where she
lives and works...
...everyone she's come
in contact with...
in the last three days.
We've got to find who put
this damned curse on her.
Every minute
matters, understand?
If we can lift the curse...
...we might stop the Final Battle
before it starts.
A lot less messy.
How much time do we have?
Not a lot. Is that her?
Yep. Svetlana
Nazarova, 29 years old.
Works at clinic number 17.
Lives with her mother
in Vatutinki...
...near the airport.
Several incidents indicate a curse:
Her mom is hospitalized.
Failed kidney, needs a transplant.
A friend's kid got sick
after she visited them.
And here's another thing:
Her neighbor,
who she calls 'Auntie Valya'...
...78 years old,
she's a tough old bird...
...but last night she had to call
an ambulance.
Seems all it takes is for this girl
to look at you...
...for something terrible to happen.
Hello. Hello, Auntie Valya.
That is the cutest puppy.
What kind is it?
Maxim found her at work.
We can't keep her,
she has to go to the pound.
Mom, she can live with us.
Let her live, Auntie Valya.
Take care.
- Thank you, Sveta dear.
Olga.
You hungry?
My new partner, the
feathered wonder.
Say something.
Talk to me.
Don't turn around.
Don't turn around.
Don't look.
Are you...?
- Don't look at me.
Are you afraid?
The shower...
...is over there.
Why did they do this to you?
It was a punishment.
How do I get this to work?
Up, and left for hot, right for cold.
I mean... Yes.
I never heard of a
punishment like that.
You've never heard
of crimes like these.
Do you have any
clothes I can wear?
Sure. Just a sec.
You got any women's clothes,
by chance?
What?
Never mind. Sorry.
Here. These were my mom's.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Something wrong?
No.
Come in for a sec.
You know, Anton...
...when a Dark Other goes away...
...goes away for good...
...we all feel it.
That's the way it is, neighbor.
It's the truce.
You know how it works.
How does it work, Anton?
Your guys and our
guys have a deal...
...that allows everything,
as long as we take turns?
Well, there is one thing I don't get.
Why does your kind get to issue us...
licenses, and not
the other way around?
You know what our hunger is,
you've felt it yourself.
Anton?
Yes, I have.
- Anton?
Wait.
What's this for?
It's soap.
What do you want me to say?
He was a cool guy.
What?
- He was a cool guy.
'Cool guy'? He was a killer.
He killed defenseless people.
He turned a girl into a vampire.
She's like you now,
only much worse.
She doesn't know
how to live with it.
You licensed him to turn her.
Maybe they wanted
to be immortal together.
They loved each other.
I did my job.
That was good.
I've been waiting 60 years
for a hot shower.
Nice vampire you've got there.
He doesn't feed on the living.
Maybe not now,
but the time will come, won't it?
Yes. And when I do,
I'll come to you legally...
...and you'll give me
a fucking license...
...won't you, neighbor?
Let him go.
He's my friend.
- He's a vampire.
He's an Other.
- He wanted to kill you.
He brought you clothes.
- We're still enemies.
Get dressed.
Are these clothes in style?
Don't know.
They're all we've got.
Don't you have a girlfriend?
I did once. A long time ago.
How long ago?
Just long.
Where is she now?
Don't know.
It's been 12 years.
Did you take your medicine?
Did you take your Andipal?
Good boy.
Experts say that the winds
building outside Moscow...
...are the strongest ever recorded...
Hello? It's Irina.
I was wondering if you could
spend the night here.
I'm worried about Yegor.
He's sick again...
...and I have to go to work.
Mom.
You can't?
Are vampires real?
Yes, Yegor.
They're little boys
who suck the life...
out of their parents.
I'm serious. They're
real, I saw them.
Hello? Hello?
Zhenya? Is that you? No?
When do you expect her back?
Baby, what's up?
Baby, need a ride?
Hello? Hello?
I'm looking for Zhenya.
Have you seen her? No?
Thanks a lot.
Great. So nobody's home.
Here, here's your medicine.
Take it right now, you hear me?
The keys.
They're real, I saw them.
Who's real?
- Vampires.
Stop playing games.
You're a big boy,
you're old enough...
to stay home alone.
Who are you?
I apologize. I assumed you knew.
I am Dracula.
Get out.
The vortex is 314 meters high...
...angle velocity currently
170 miles per hour...
...and we've got an airplane
entering the red zone.
Airplane? What the hell?
Flight out of Antalya.
A bird got into the turbine.
A bird?
A crow.
Where is the Call coming from?
Seventh floor.
- What?.
Seventh.
- Fuck.
What bastard left the door open?
It's her.
She's here.
She could be anywhere.
It's safer if we go in
through the Gloom.
I see you.
Can he really?
Yes. He must be an Other.
How long can he
stay in the Gloom?
Not long. He's had no training.
How long do we have?
Ten seconds before
the Gloom consumes him.
Stay away.
- Look at me. Look at me.
Eight.
Seven.
- Don't close your eyes.
Six.
- Give me your hand.
Five.
- Give me your hand.
Four.
I'm not afraid of you.
Now.
Open your eyes.
Don't touch him.
He's already lost.
If we stay longer,
the Gloom will take us too.
The Gloom has started to take me.
We have to save Yegor.
Distract the Gloom, feed it...
...and we can slip him out.
Give it blood.
It was so dark.
Why was it so dark?
Did you do that?
No. It's called the Gloom.
You can see it because...
...you're an Other.
Other?
I'm not...
...like normal people?
Not anymore.
Is that a good thing, or bad?
Just...
...different.
HOT NEWS
We have an emergency bulletin...
from the National
Forecast Bureau:
Due to abnormally severe weather...
conditions, a tornado
watch is in effect.
So, what are 'the Others'?
Well...
Scoot over.
Some people are born special.
But they don't even know it.
How do they find out?
When they have to
do something extraordinary...
...like lift a car to rescue someone
who is trapped...
...or defend themselves
from a vampire attack...
...something awakens inside them.
And after that,
life is completely changed.
If there's no one close
to you to explain...
what's happened to you...
...to train you in how
to use your new gifts...
...you could die.
Every Other has a different gift.
Soon you'll discover yours.
You'll use your
powers to serve Dark,
or Light.
What kind of Others are you?
Light or Dark?
Us? We're Light.
What about me?
You'll have to decide for yourself.
Understand?
What's the difference between
Dark and Light Others?
All Others draw their power
from what is inside people.
The Dark ones feed on darkness,
the Light ones on light.
Understand? Like food.
You don't eat normal food?
Us? We would if someone offered.
My bad.
You like dumplings?
Dumplings? I love dumplings.
Look, I just don't get it...
What's not to get?
She's pregnant, you know.
And the baby's not yours.
Don't worry, I'll bring her back.
Well, I...
What's the problem?
- No problem.
What are you muttering about?
How do I know if it's true?
Trust me on this.
It's a boy.
Yegor?
Who's this?
Mom.
How old are you?
Twelve.
Are you sure she's
not coming back?
Who?
The vampire girl.
She won't.
Not while we're here.
Damn.
Did you salt the dumplings?
The vortex is almost open
and he's still with the kid.
What do we do?
Just be patient...
...and everything
will come together.
Get ready. It's time.
753 to ground control. Request
permission for emergency landing.
Negative, ground
systems are down.
Circle at altitude and stand by.
I told you I needed all her contacts
for the last three days.
Can you do that or not?
- I can't.
The software's totally outdated...
- Enough.
We're leaving.
We'll have to stop it on the ground.
Call Anton. We'll
send him to Svetlana.
Hello? Hello, Anton?
Yes?
We're moving the HQ to Vatutinki.
What's in Vatutinki?
Svetlana 's apartment.
It's ground zero for the vortex.
We've got to stop it.
Tiger Cub and Bear
will replace you.
Here. Be more careful next time.
Are you leaving?
Tiger Cub and Bear will replace us.
- What do you mean, 'Bear'?
Yegor. I'll be back soon.
Promise?
- Promise.
All right. I trust you.
Don't worry. They'll
take care of him.
He'll be fine.
It'll all work out, Anton.
Watch the road, Simeon.
Watch the road, Simeon.
Simeon?
What's wrong?
Help.
What's wrong?
Please help.
Valya.
- Auntie Valya is dead.
Maxim found her at work.
Mom, she can live with us.
What's wrong?
- Maxim's mother died.
Who the hell is Maxim?
The pressure's up.
But I can't see
where the problem is.
We have to call Valya's son.
I can't. I just can't.
It's all right. I'll call him.
Shit. My sausages are boiling over.
They're going to explode.
Is this the power station?
Maxim lvanovich, please.
It's for you. Cover for me, okay?
Exploding sausages.
Maxim lvanovich?
- Speaking.
Your mother is dead.
Hello? Hello? Maxim Ivanovich?
Can you hear me?
Shit. They're about to go.
Hang on, Maxim.
Damn it, we're too late.
It's going to fall on us.
- Relax.
Where is it?
The vortex? Right there.
Kill the juice.
Upstairs, get the cable up here.
Run the cable.
More, more.
Svetlana's apartment
is across the way.
We're set up at ground zero.
Pubs for instance.
Shut down all pubs,
rock concerts, football matches...
Negative field
density of 87 percent.
The vortex is growing
exponentially.
Got it, got it.
Who are these people?
- They live here.
Are you insane?
Shouldn't have been eating while
watching TV. Bad for the eyes.
Have you found who cursed her?
Nobody cursed her. Nobody.
You act like you've never heard
of the Apocalypse.
What's the big deal? A vortex?
I remember in 1941,
when I stepped on a landmine.
Now, that was a huge hole.
Since then, my right
ear hears okay,
but my left...
I've analyzed the
vortex's growth rate.
It's going to blow soon.
We have to get out of here.
What does the pointy arrow do?
Don't touch that.
Did I ask for your help?
Looks like you need it,
you fucking hacker.
Field density's 92 percent.
We're running out of time.
Have you tried every intersection?
Fine, go ahead, you try it.
Let's see.
I've checked all her friends, family,
acquaintances.
Not one.
Not a single Other among them.
No one who could create
a curse this big.
What motherfucker cursed her?
Mother, there's a thought.
Look, I'll show you.
Nazarova, Sergeyevna, born 1947.
Former schoolteacher,
now retired.
Currently in the hospital
with kidney failure.
Anton, Geser is waiting for you.
I've checked her a thousand times.
Look, look.
She's not an Other.
Sorry.
'Anton Gorodetsky,
revealed as an Other 8/19/92.
Chose to join the Light.
Became an officer of Night Watch.
Friendly with his neighbor,
who is a Dark Other.
History of alcohol abuse.
Considered capable of killing.
First came to attention
of Night Watch...
during the arrest of Mrs. Schultz...
...for illegal practice of dark magic
under false pretenses.'
False pretenses?
Why did you lie to him?
You knew it was his child.
You knew it was his child.
Come on, Anton. Let's go.
Let's go.
Anton, come on.
What's the matter with you?
Geser wants to see you.
The Light Other with the dark past.
I've been looking for you.
Who's that barking
in the shadows?
Knock it off, Zavulon.
Kill the lights.
You invited me here after all...
Give him the protection charm.
I'm not the one who killed
someone illegally...
He needs to be
protected against you.
Throw it.
- Should I?
Behave yourself, Zavulon.
Catch.
Repeat after me:
You have no power
over me, Zavulon.
You have no power
over me, Zavulon.
Well, I'll leave you two alone.
Fine.
Let's go, Ugly.
See you soon.
Go to her apartment,
find out who cursed her.
And then?
There are two ways
to stop the vortex:
Either find out who cursed her...
...and make them lift it...
...or she has to die.
Are you telling me to kill her?
One life against thousands.
Maybe millions.
Door code is 1322.
What if she recognizes me
from the metro?
Tell her you're one of her patients,
feeling sick.
She sees hundreds of patients,
she'll think you're one of them.
Anton, do you want me
to sing you something?
Hello, Dr. Nazarova.
Can I help you?
I'm sorry to bother you at home.
You have enough on your hands
at work.
It's all right, come
in. I'll take a look.
Just let me wash my hands.
Is she as pretty as you remember?
- How's Yegor?
Don 't worry, Tiger Cub and Bear
are taking care of him.
Good.
Come to me.
It's time for you to go.
Are you kicking us out?
No. But my mom
will come home soon.
How do I explain you two?
Say we're electricians.
Fixing the lights.
Watch this.
Why do they call you 'Bear'?
Because he's a shape-shifter,
that's his gift.
He can turn into a bear.
Me, I can become a tiger.
Show me.
Show you what?
How you turn into a bear.
Some other time, Yegor.
You're just embarrassed.
Embarrassed? About what?
If you change,
your clothes will rip up...
...and I'll see you naked.
That doesn't embarrass me.
So change. I promise I won't look.
Come to me.
What is this, the circus?
Come.
Yegor.
Yegor. Wait.
Yegor.
Yegor. Come back.
Come.
Yegor.
Yegor, wait.
I didn't get the name yet.
Lie down, I'll be right there.
Lie down where?
Lie down where?
Right in here.
Where does it hurt?
My stomach. I think it's an ulcer.
Does that hurt?
Yes.
- How often?
All the time.
Have you been under
a lot of stress?
You know, the usual.
Does it hurt here?
Yes.
It shouldn't.
No. That's not an ulcer.
What is it, then?
Nothing.
You're absolutely healthy.
Really? Then why am I here?
Exactly. Why are you here?
Stay back.
I'll only talk to the one
who killed my Andrei.
Who the hell's Andrei?
- Get him here. Now.
Get out. Right now.
You've been cursed.
- What?
You have a curse.
You're crazy.
Yeah?
The vortex is expanding,
do something, now.
Look...
- Leave.
I'm here to find out...
- Find out what?
No, no. I've come to apologize.
Fine. I forgive you. Now leave.
You haven't asked why.
- Why?
Because I pushed
you in the subway.
It's okay.
But I did it on purpose.
You stood in my way,
and I pushed you.
Forgive me.
I forgive you.
Call Anton. Now.
- Okay, okay.
See, I'm calling him.
Please, go away.
Why are you doing this?
Do you want a drink?
I've got some with me.
Hello?
- Hello.
Get Anton here.
She won't wait.
What should we do?
Have a drink with me.
- Are you nuts?
What? Olga, it's Bear.
What's up?
- They lost him.
Who?
- Yegor.
The vampiress wants Anton.
Play for time.
It wasn't for you, Anton.
Tell me what happened.
What the hell happened?
The vampire has Yegor.
She wants you to come.
My mother is dying.
It's my fault.
I wanted her to die.
I thought that if it weren't for her...
...I'd have been
married with a child...
long ago.
And as soon as I thought that...
...the hospital called
and said her kidney failed.
That she needed a transplant.
So I offered my own kidney.
I passed the tests...
...but she refused.
I knew she would.
I did it on purpose,
you understand?
If I'd kept my mouth shut,
she would have taken
the transplant...
...but I told her I was the donor,
because I knew she'd refuse.
I've cursed myself, I'm damned.
That's it.
Anton, you got it.
She cursed herself.
She's an Other.
The curse is lifted.
She's taken it back.
You shouldn't say things like that.
'Damned' isn't just a word.
That's it. Let's go.
Wait. Let me. It's okay.
Here I am.
Here I am, let him go.
Take off the charm.
Fine. There.
Toss the flashlight too.
It won't hurt you...
- Do it.
Okay, okay.
Just don't do anything stupid.
You want some blood? Here.
I want my life.
Then live.
Live.
Who's stopping you?
I want to be human again.
You want to be human?
Then behave like a human being.
Do you behave like human beings?
I loved him...
...and you people gave me to him...
...like food.
And then killed him. You did.
I had no choice.
He broke the truce.
You, the Light ones,
the good ones...
...you say you protect the world
from Darkness.
Where were you
when he drank my blood?
Why can't I drink the boy's?
Because I won't let you.
Yegor, run.
Get away. Get away.
Get away.
Go on, get back.
Son of a bitch.
Yegor?
Lost the charm?
Where is he? Where's my son?
Yegor.
- You have no right to interfere.
Anton.
Anton.
Anton.
Anton.
Hush, now, hush. Take it easy.
I brought you the charm.
Did you really want to kill me?
No...
- Yes, you did.
No.
Don't believe him,
I didn't want to kill you.
Alice, read it.
'Night Watch Arrest Report,
dated August 19, 1992.
Mr. Gorodetsky
visited Ms. Schultz...
...residing at 10,
Starozachatsky Alley.
He paid a fee to Ms. Schultz...
...for a service
involving dark magic.
Having been warned by her,
he still agreed...
...to bear responsibility...
...for murdering the unborn child
of his wife, Irina Petrova.'
So you really did want to kill me.
Yes, but...
...then I found you, and I wanted...
- To kill me?
You wanted to kill me?
Yegor. Please.
Don't go with them. They are Dark.
You're no better than the Dark.
You're worse.
You lie. You only
pretend to be good.
I've been waiting centuries for this.
Those fated to drown...
...will drown.
Those fated to fall from a roof...
...will fall.
This boy was always
fated to be great.
But it was you who made him
choose the Dark.
It's done now, you can't change it.
Stay away from him.
I will take care of him now.
You set all this up, didn't you?
You bastard.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Come on.
Go on.
That's it. Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Come on. Come on.
Go ahead. Go on.
Come on.
And so it came to pass...
the Great Other came
into the world...
...and chose the side of evil.
Legend says he will
plunge the world...
into darkness.
But so long as there
are those among us...
who believe in Light...
...there will be hope.
