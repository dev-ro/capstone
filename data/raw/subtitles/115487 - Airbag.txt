Good evening.
Sorry l´m late, fuck.
-l´m Serafin.
-We´d given you up.
-Have you brought the money?
-Yes, of course.
-Count it.
-Just sit down, please.
Right. The money´s all here.
15million pesetas each.
The house takes apercentage.
The winner takes 60 million.
You all know the rules?
Who doesn´t?
Alain, if you please.
On the plate on the right...
we have one delicious
´´Amanita caesarea´´ mushroom.
And on the left,
four ´´Amanitaphalloides´´,
or deathcup mushroom,
absolutely deadly.
Now l´m going to make
five omelets,
one with the´´caesarea´´ and
four with the ´´phalloides´´,
which you all have agreed
to eat. ´´Bon apetit´´.
Right. The rules are simple.
The player who survives
wins the 60 million.
Good luck, and enjoy your meals.
Remember, you can always pull out...
All you will lose is your money.
l don´t feel very hungry.
Thank you.
Only four omelets then.
And only one is harmless.
´´Etvoil+´´.
Can l start? l like to be
first in everything.
l don´t know why l do this.
l´m stinking rich.
Son of abitch!
lt´s nothing personal.
l´m allergic to mushrooms.
Your health, gentlemen.
Holy shit!
Right, gentlemen, you decide.
Okay, fifty-fifty then?
Come on, let´s see if you´ve
got the balls.
Eat, you bastard,
it´s equal odds.
What´s a meal without
bread and wine?
Where´re you from?
-Logroño, sir.
-Gibraltar more like.
Fill it up.
Fucking great!
l´ve been lucky!
Sorry Serafin, but you can
still pull out.
Pull out? And leave this wine?
You crazy? l´m staying because
l need the dough.
But you´ve got no chance.
lt looks like this gentleman´s survived.
So what?
l´m a gambler and l never give up.
Right then, if everything´s in order...
one of us should snuff it.
Of course, everything´s in order.
l don´t feel well.
l feel bad, very bad.
l think l´m gonna die.
Damned mushrooms, damned chef...
Tough luck!
l´m dying! l´m dying!
l´m sorry, gents...
Can´t stop for coffee.
My chauffeur´s double-parked.
What aprofessional!
My dear friends...
Father Burutxaga...
Thank you for joining me...
joining us...
...tonight.
lt seems that it falls to me
to announce the forthcoming marriage
of my daughter, Araceli, baby...
and Juantxo Ortiz deZarate.
Next Saturday, the6th.
Apparently his father, Don Serafin
is unable to be with us tonight.
Pity, isn´t it Begoña?
What a shame.
There is nothing more
important for amother...
This rotten cow...!
Hi, Angela!
Christ!What a surprise, Hermengilda.
How are you?
Come, sit down with us.
Hi. How are you?
Fine, Angela.
Mom, l´ll be with Konradin.
l was telling the girls...
that Jesus is the patron saint of pimps.
Did he not
get an erection when he saw
Mary Magdalene on the cross?
l believe it´s been proved.
lt´s not in the Scriptures
because it was censored.
Yes, there´s nothing more
important for amother...
...than the wedding of her daughter.
Which is why no expense or
sacrifice has been spared.
As you can see from this habit...
There are 20,000 guys our age
in this city.
How come my sister´s spent 10 years
running after the same dickhead?
l read about it this morning
in the ´´Guinness´´...
l didn´t think it possible...
l want it to be areally special day.
And l´ve had two fabluous
diamond rings...
with Colombian emeralds
and two lndian rubies...
all set in white gold
from South Africa
made by our great Basque
artist and designer,
Omar Urretabizkaia.
Thank you, ´´habbibi´´.
They were rather expensive...
30 million each.
But worth every penny.
Juantxo...
l´m givingyou two jewels.
Treat themwith
love and care.
Of course.
Now we´d all love to hear
whatyou´ve got to say.
Speech! Speech!
Come on.
My boy.
Marquise...
and other ladies and gentlemen
of the jury. l mean, in general...
The concept...
This really is a very
important day for me.
-l can only say thank you...
-Conceivedwithout sin...
...especially to the marquise,
who is guilty...responsible
for...all this.
Thanks to my parents,
for everything...
...education, aposition,
and alegal practice...
Three Hail Mary´s.
l´m busy right now.
Ego te absolvo.
The concept is basically...
l think you could say that
l´m a very lucky guy.
Go for it, San Sebastian!
And finally
...let´s raise our
glasses and toast...
That´s it, a toast!
Give me a glass of that.
l´m dry.
Good speech, son, just like
alawyer.
Now take abreak.
Sorry l´m late. The traffic´s
fucking awful.
Startedwithout me, have you?
Well done!
Marquise, you look gorgeous.
What´s with the bishop´s outfit?
Not permanent, is it?
-How´s the wine?
-Fine, dad.
An ´87 Beronia!
Shit! Excellent wine!
l´m not...
very good at this
but today is a great day for me.
José Mari and Aurori´s
daughter...
is going to marry my boy, the
eldest...
Just got his degree at thirty.
Took his fucking time!
And now the best bit.
Thirty million, in cash.
The way it´s more useful
Dad, it´s too much.
-No it´s not.
-You´re tipsy.
Carlos! Champagne all round!
These days men´s balls
have shrunk to this size.
You guys missed the pelota game.
Boy, was it exciting!
Excitement? There´ll be
plenty of that tomorrow.
-Who´s playing?
-Us against the Portuguese.
At3 p.m. in my showroom.
What does it say, Angela?
-l bet it´s something bad.
-Pako´s idea for sure.
lt´s for Juantxo. Pass it to him.
And for Konrado.
Being arebel today has no meaning.
Serafin, it´s not ajoke.
Let´s pay the damn tobacco.
Ye of little faith!
l´ll get this one.
TUESDAY, GRAND STAG PARTY.
´´Scandalo´´. 10 PM.
´´Konrado Volvos.´´ Hello.
Fitting an airbag, prick?
l bet you haven´t got the
car for tonight.
-Dad, can l borrow a...?
-No.
Up yours!
They´ll recognize my car.
Don´t worry. They all look
the same in the dark.
Sorry.
You´ll be like
a pig in clover, Juantxo.
They´ve got some mulatto girls
that are hot stuff, man.
No, guys, l´llwait for you outside.
Don´t be an asshole,
it´s your stag night.
-Right.
-l´m just not in the mood.
Hey, guys, l´m worried about
these spots at the bottom of...
Sometimes the PH of vaginal
fluid irritates the mucus.
What do you know
about mucus, aristocrat?
Have you brought the money,
aristocrat?
Yeah, l´ve brought the money.
And something more important.
-This.
-Let´s see the instructions.
Come on.
What do you think?
The harem.
Don´t tell me you´ve
been here before.
Sure l have.
Let´s get laid.
l´m going to talk about free
love.
And the only professional of
that love...
...Jesus.
l can see that all of you are rebels.
He was a rebel too.
And l also want to be one.
Long live free love.
Evening, ladies.
l´ve brought a friend
with bags of money.
He´s getting married Saturday.
Right, ´´marquis´´?
This one´s gonna get his
coffee with two sugars.
Ain´t he now?
Gently...You like making love don´tyou?
Gently.
Poor thing.Where did you get
that anaconda, big boy?
-You come along with me.
-Yes, ladies.
l´m arebel
because the world
made me that way.
Because nobody ever
showed me love.
Because nobody´s ever
listened to me.
Wow. lt´s getting as hard as a rock.
This way.
l´m a rebel because
l´ve always been that way.
They refused to give me
what l asked for.
They just failed to understand.
l wanted to be
like any other kid,
any other man
who´s happy.
l wanted
to give what´s inside me
in return for friendship.
To live
and dream,
and forget rancour,
and sing
and laugh
and give
only
love.
l´m married.
Aren´t they all, honey?
lt´s just...
Visa card or cash, my love?
Visa or cash?
Ah, now?
ln cash, okay?
We´ll sort it out later.
But don´t make it a habit.
Take your clothes off
and wash it.
Wash what?
Oh, come on, honey.
Ph all the way!
lt´s freezing!
l´m sorry, it´s a crappy tap.
Did l scald it.
l´ll never get
the hang of it.
Now with a nice bit of soap.
l don´t like being kissed.
Stop, stop!
l´ll touch you.
-Are your hands clean?
-Of course.
Oh, honey...
it feels like gum.
Well...
Dry yourself.
You gonna give me the money?
lt´s there.
Excuse me.
Araceli de Alda? ls she your wife?
Yeah.Well, not yet, but...
You should have hangers
in a place like this.
Well...?
Did you enjoy it?
Yeah, it was wild.
Just great.
You´re quite a performer.
Maybe a bit short.
Timewise l mean.
´´Short but sweet´´, as they say.
You´re so wise, my love.
And so virile.
l do my best.
Was it really too short?
Hey, you´re a romantic.
You´re a sweet guy.
Do you want to do it again?
l think it´s getting a bit late.
Oh, come on, honey.
Talking is nice too.
l love your accent.
Fucking´s not everything.
To making love, l mean.
What do you mean ´´love´´?
You´re nuts. That´s great.
Ask, ask, l´ll tell you.
What would you like to know?
One, two, three...
Four.
Pump in,
ventricular,
Pump out,
auricular...
Ventricular
Auricular.
Come on.
lnhale, exhale...
Very good. You´re doing great.
Now l think...
What´s wrong, my love?
You don´t like rubbers,
do you?
Yes, l have to relax.
Better darling?
l´m relaxing...
Come here,
give me your finger.
Suck my finger, darling.
Won´t you do it for me?
-Suck my finger.
-No
Cheers! To eternal screwing
and UFO´s.
And fucking them till they
drop.
To death!
Boy, did l sweat!
l fucked her brains out!.
And what apiece of ass,
eh Konra?
Yeah, they were great.
She was gorgeous.
Look at him, Konra.
Not a peep out of him.
Did you score then?
Well, not exactly.
Yes, l did. l mean...
Juantxo, what´s the matter?
Are you OK?
My engagement ring.
Fucking kids!
Go kill yourselves!
What happened?
l´m sorry about the ring.
-Why?
-Because it was my idea.
Who hit you?
A lot of guys are into
violence.
lt turns them on.
lt was my boss.
For not charging a client.
Look, about the ring...
l´m not talking about
the damned ring.
Do you like your boss?
Shit!
Wait...
l like you. A lot.
l thought you were Cuban.
l like you too.
You´re fantastic.
lt may sound like an excuse
but it was my first time.
You were great.
You´re an angel, but l don´t
have your ring
l didn´t think so.
Who´s got it?
lt´s dangerous.
Please.
Somebody who´s into violence.
Your boss?
What´s his name?
Call him over.
-Why?
-l know how to hit too.
Mr Villambrosa isn´t here.
Where is he?
Can you really fight?
Sure.
l´m a karate black belt.
He´s at the ´´Kokotxa´´ club.
Do you like hitting women?
That´s a shame.
l deserve to be hit.
Poor creature, so full of vice!
Well, thanks, l´ve got to go.
Bye. Take care, karate kid.
Bye, Sweetheart.
They´ll kill me.
Guys, it´s all your fault.
-Why did we have to go there?
-Cool it.We´ll find it.
´´Nuisance´´, 6 letters.
Harass.
And did she use her finger
on you, too?
-None of your business.
-What do you mean?
lf you like it up the rear...
Up yours, Pako!
That´s what l mean.
lt´s not normal.
lt´s not normal?
All right, it´s not normal!
Hey, guys, don´t get uptight.
Why don´t we just let fate
take its course?
According to the theory
of chaos...
Right! You got it.
See, Juantxo, how you get
desperate so easily.
That´s what creates chaos.
Just relax
Listen to some music.
Relax? You´re gonna fucking
kill us!
No fucking way. This car´s
what you call life insurance!
Airbags on the driver´s and
passenger´s sides.
Great. ln the back it´s
my ass that´s on the line.
-Don´t say that word again!
-l didn´t say ´´ass´´.
-Yes, you did.
-No, l didn´t.
-You did!
-l didn´t!
´´Harass´´. l said ´´harass´´.
Konrad!
´´Nuisance... six letters.´´
´´Harass´´.
You said it.
-Crash... collision.
-How many letters?
Stop!
Shit!
DANGER.
BATHlNG PROHlBlTED
Shit!
Today is not our day.
l´ve wrecked the car!
Fuck me!
That´s all we needed.
So much for the airbags.
Hell, why didn´t they work?
Driver, passenger,
life insurance...
Shut up, will you! All this is
for your fucking ring!
And whose idea was it to...
To what? Stick your finger up
her ass or yours?
Up your old man´s ass!
Any body hurt?
Not yet, but...
Hey! Are you Villambrosa?
Jesus, do you know me?
No, l don´t.
That ring belongs to me.
Where have you been putting
your finger?
You should be ashamed of
yourself!
Cool it, Juanxto. l´ll handle
this.
He´ll tell you.
-l can´t hear you.
-He´ll tellyou!
Well, Pako decided to organize
a stag party
-By the way, l´m Konrado.
-And he´s Pako, the driver.
Shit, Konrado! Cut the chat!
lf you think it´s so easy,
you explain it.
Where was l?
Well, when Juantxo
stuck his...
The Marquise de Alda gave it
to him as her dowry.
Yes, that engagement ring.
So the ring belongs to
that young man?
Please give it back. lt´s got
huge sentimental value.
What kind of
huge value?
l dunno, millions.
How much was it, Juanxto?
Hey, you!
Come back!
Shitbag!
Hey!
Thief!
Bastard!
Hey!
Shitbag!
Oh, shit, the airbags!
Just when we needed them.
Pako, will you
stop this thing!
Stop this! Shit!
For God´s sake!
l´m suffocating!
Try and breathe.
-l can´t!
-Take it easy.
lt´s got limited dimensions
and it´s explosion-proof.
Hey, mister!
Stop it!
That´s the way it is!
Let´s go.
l can´t take it anymore.
-The damage doesn´t look too bad!
-Are you stupid?
Konra, where´re you going?
There´s a huge chance that
it´ll explode.
Why should it explode?
-Like in ´´Starsky and Hutch´´.
-lf you say so.
Shit! run!
Run!
Rats!
Filthy blackmailers!
Some people have got
no scruples.
30 million for
some crap photos
that are out of focus.
That fucking kid
was pretty cute. lncredible!
Hello? Yes, yes.
lt´s Mr Villambrosa.
Palomeque, watch the puddle.
What about the briefcase?
l wanted the thirty million
here today.
Today, tod..ay!
Look, Mr Candidate,
l have business in Portugal.
And l´ve got problems with Souza.
Every time l talk
to him my ulcer plays up.
Sir, l think we should call
it a day.
l want to master this game before
the elections.
There´s still aweek to go.
You´ll have the money tomorrow.
Your money and the ´´gift´´
you wanted.
Still unopened.
You realize l´m a good investment
in your future.
Don´t forget that.
Bye for now
´´Mr President´´.
Excuse me, sir, we´re at
the hole...
l don´t feel very well.
Tourino, call Souza. No more
fuck ups.
Listen about ´´Russian Omelette´´...
Call the Portuguese guy.
You´re right there.Wait.
Pako´s right.
You can´t go back without
the ring, Juantxo.
l´ve been away from home
for 20 hours.
Yeah, that´s true. Hold on.
His fiancee hasn´t heard
from him.
So fucking what?
Wait a second.
You guys are driving me nuts.
l´m outta here.
Hey! Kiddos, you, Konrad,
we need a car.
And Juantxo, we need money.
No way!
l Copied it exactly.
But the best thing was when they
put their glasses on.
l just don´t know.
Glasses!
Hey, Guys!
l dunno.
ALENTEJO,
SOUTHERN PORTUGAL.
Joao Villambrosa.
-My friend. How are you?
-Fine.
But worse than you for sure.
How´s the ulcer?
Better, thanks.
lt´s been fine
for the past few weeks.
ln fact...
Since l last talked to you.
You should control that temper
of yours.
l´ll give you a home-made remedy
on Friday. At the casino.
Brazilian medicine.
Don´t bother.
On Friday l´ll forget my
pains as soon as l see the ´´cattle´´.
l´m bringing the best girls
you´ve ever seen.
Not just because l respect you.
l also have my own motives...
Your cooperation means alot to me.
Yes, in Arosanot only will we
sign our partnership
but also seal our friendship.
By the way,
could we not bring the
the swap forward to today?
l´ll tell Fatima do Espirito
Santo.
-See you on Friday in my casino.
-Look after your health.
Thanks. Don´t wor...
l feel worse.
Now l hear you better, Tourino.
We can´t pick up the ´´microwaves´´
inside.
We don´t have a satellite dish.
Listen, Pazos, we´re not going
that way, so listen.
Have you got the ´´crabs´´?
´´Crabs´´?
No, it´s not the season.
Only in the months with ´´r´´ in them
January, February...
l said ´´crabs´´.
Ten kilos worth.
The coke?
Why didn´t you say so?
Yes, the order arrived.
Who will pick up the drop?
The Portuguese will
be there at 6.
The goods are worth 30 million.
Take the money and bring it to
Arosa.
Do you think you
can manage that?
Come on, boss,
just trust me.
l´m an old hand at this.
They´re professionals so try
and act like one.
lt´s as easy as peeling abanana.
Give my regards
to Mr Villambrosa...
Sorry.
My poor child.
All under control, sir.
Pass me an ´´Almax´´.
They´re real busy.
No, Konra, that´s showing off.
-Sure this is it, guys?
-Yeah, of course it is.
La Kokotxa. Look, prawns!
Afternoon. Mr Villambrosa?
Of course.
l´ve just spoken to him.
l dunno, l expected you to have
an accent.
Good afternoon.
Excuse me, but we think you have
something that belongs to us.
Yes, in aminute.
But have a drink first.
You must be tired.
-Yeah. Of going up and down.
-We got lost three times.
Well just relax.We´ve got some
girls you´re gonna love.
On the house, as usual.
You´re very hospitable.
Very kind. Nice and cool.
By the way,
what about Villambrosa?
He´s fine, thanks. l´ll tell him
you asked after him.
Now tell me, has your car got
airbags?
Driver, passenger and side, just
fitted.
Fucking professional.
Like aring on a finger.
Mr Villambrosa could be a
bit more discreet.
Did he say he was coming?
He´s very definitely
coming or not coming.
He was very clear on that matter.
l couldn´t hear him very well.
We´ve had trouble with the
imm mobile phone.
Listen.
Mr Villambrosa left the matter
in my hands.
So no need to worry
Everything will work out o.k.
But now... a concept.
Why don´t you relax and get laid?
We´ve got plenty of time.
And l´ll go get organized.
Marquitos! Tonin! Back to
work. Fuck!
We´re pushed for time. And feed
those fucking hens!
l painted this in my hippy phase.
-What do you think?
-Exquisite, colorful.
l´m an artist, man.
l was a sailor, a welterweight,
and a sculptor.
But they don´t appreciate me.
Move it!
Nayat!
Navratilova!
One´s Arabic, the other´s
Chechen.
High class, real pros.
Where´s the fire?
Well, well.
Three young ´uns.
Great.
Sorry, but l´ve come here to...
No, you take it easy.
You and me are going to have
a few drinks.
Us partners have got to get to
know one another.
Girls...
Give ´em some liposuctions.
You know what l mean?
l do indeed.
God, what abunch of wimps!
Palmira, open that bottle of
grappa of mine.
-Grappa?
-l was keeping it...
for a special occasion.
l can see you´ve
got a good eye.
lt´s not the standard Mini-Uzi.
lts the Micro-Uzi SMG.
Sub machine Gun.
A killing machine. A real gem.
You´d noticed of course.
-Hold it.
-No.
-Hold it!
-No.
Hold it for fucksakes!
Holy shit!
And there´s me explaining.
Shit! These foreigners come
really prepared.
´´So machine gun´´, eh?
Palmira, another bottle!
Very professional.
Right, that´s it.
Christ, there are more tourists.

What a sight!
What a vision!
Don´t get any ideas.
She won´t look atyou.
Wanna bet?
Hi.
Smells of gunpowder.
l like it.
Were you expecting me?
All my life.

l understandyou know about
airbags.
Oh no, not again.
My partner´s an expert. He
spends all day fitting them.
Fantastic!
l like driving fast.
And l think l´d feel safer
with one of those things.
Could you look at my airbags?
We don´t mind, do we Konrad?
Where were we?
l like going fast...
...and coming slow:
Hello. Oh, it´s you.
l have to check the airbags.
Of course.
Let´s get out.
After 15 years of marriage,
with the kids at the best
schools in ´´Cam Ford´´...
They had everything.
Now l´m alone. All alone.
Ah, Carmina.
Her in Galicia
and me in the Basque country.
l´m sorry, man. lt upsets me.
Go ahead and cry.
Let off some steam.
You said it. l´m all choked up.
You understand, don´t you?
Of course.
Damn it all!
Come on ´´El Depor´´!
You were right
l didn´t listen to you.
l have to accept that
with a glass in front of me.
My head feels heavy
How l suffer.
l swear l need
to return.
There´s a woman all alone
waiting for me too.
The hell with it!
All checked, ma´am.
Konra, this is my friend...
Glad to meet you.
´´So machine gun´´.
l´m leaving.
Now?
l owe you a dance.
What the fuck...
And the ring?
Fucking bitch!
Hey, amigo.
Where´s Villambrosa?
Watch your step with Villambrosa.
He´s a son of a bitch.
He´s got money in ´´ambulance´´,
He´ll be at the ´´Big Club´´.
The best place we´ve got.
Swish place. You ought to
see it.
Straight ahead at the intersexual,
and you can´t miss it.
Okay, Pazos.
What do we owe you?
-lt´s on the house.
-Let´s go then.
My money ain´t good enough
for you or what?
Dickhead!
Fucking hell!
l´ll blow your fucking heads off!
A bit of respect, Chrissakes.
Easy, guys.
Pazos is a cool dude.
Quit clowning around.
Hand over the fucking case.
What case?
The one you got in your hand,
fucker.
He´s just goofing around.
Now let´s check the goods.
First something to fire you up.
No, Pazos, amigo.
No more firing, please.
We trust each other then.
Between you guys and Villambrosa
there´s an important engagement...
-The ring. 30 million pesetas worth.
-That´s why we´re here.
30 million. l know.
Trust is everything.
Professional.
Very professional.
Harder!
Harder!
-Well l´ll be fucked!
-Nothing.
Son of abitch.
Nobody outsmarts Fatima.
Hey, Mr Tourino.
How are you?
Tell the president he´ll have
to tighten his belt.
We did the swap.
But their case was sort of...
sort of...
sort of e-m-p-t-y!
Empty!
You´ll have the goods, Mr Souza. Leave
it to me in a few minutes.
No, l didn´t know.
How was l to know it was
a jack in the box?
Travelling with your buddies.
Money in your pocket and the
tank full of gas.
And alot of road ahead.
200 km to the ´´Big Club´´.
The world is red.
lt´s blue.
lt´s all black to me.
The ring. Son of abitch.
Don´t stop.
They look like punks.
-Who?
-Those hitchhikers.
Holy Christ and all the saints
in abarrel!
Stop after the bend!
We´ll wait further on.
Was that good luck, corporal
or bad luck?
What do you mean, lieutenant?
Three cars almost run us
down in a few seconds.
That´s bad luck.
But they didn´t.
So that´s good luck.
lt´s a dilemma.
lt depends how
you look at it.
Sir, aren´t you going to
question them?
Of course.
Afternoon.
Why didn´t you brake before?
Do you mean ´´before´´ in space
or in time?
Good question.
The 1st would be that seeing you,
l should have braked before.
The 2nd would mean that
having braked
the car wouldn´t stop in time.
lnteresting.
So the ultimate question would be:
who´s to blame, car or driver?
Guilty.
l understand.
Another dilemma.
So ask the question again
properly this time.
Konrad, cut the chat.
Allow me, lieutenant.
Afternoon.
The car´s papers.
-Konrad, where are they?
-l´ll get them.
Sorry.
l´m alawyer, eh?
Get him to specify which papers.
Listen, smartasses.
Get the papers out of the
fucking car right now...
Or l´ll throw the fucking book
atyou.
-Don´t hit the car, it´s new.
-So what!
So fuckingwhat?
Didn´t l tellyou l was a
lawyer, you clown?
Flathead!
-He´s drunk.
-Get out.
Don´t hit the car, please.
Get out of the car.
Right...
now!
What the fuck are you doing?
Stop that!
Follow them!
l´ll call the station.
No, we´ll both
call the station.
We´ll both call. That way
we´ll make absolutely sure.
l smell ´´crabs´´.
Your driving turns me on,
you bastard.
Come on, step on it.
They´re ours.
l told you they
were terrorists, lieutenant.
Get out! Get out!
Will you listen to me, damn it!
Let the lawyer speak.
Fuck!
l can´t remember why...
But l am not going in there
-No way!
-No chance!
-This is aparadise.
-Paradise.
We shouldn´t forget
why we´re here.
We won´t.
-We´ll just check out the place.
-Let´s go.
-Evening, gentlemen.
-Evening.
Monica!
She´ll fit the bracelets and
explain the rules.
Hi.
-Welcome to the ´´Big Club.´´
-Thanks.
Services are registered here.
Please come with me, gentlemen.
Shallwe go in?
What goes in must come out.
Two, four and six.
Pazos!
What the fuck´s going o~?
Lieutenant Llorente.
Great to see you in the club again:
What the hell
was all that shooting?
And those alarms...
and guns.
We thought we heard screams
but it was a false alarm.
Get ready for an inspection
downstairs.
Sorry.
Pazitos, Pazitos.
Come on, boys.
Let´s go.
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Big Club
Will be closing its door in a few minutes.
Don´t forget our special offer
for Easter.
Thank you for your visit.
Smallworld, isn´t it?
-He´s not here.
-The next one then:
Okoito.
-What´s that?
-Bad PH.
Lt´s war.
Hey, any cash left?
A bit.
Four more.
L pass.
-Do you like it, mom?
-You look great.
Beautiful, dear.
Lt´s the same as the one
on Thursday, but worse...
Help yourselves.
There´s more than enough.
Mom, ´´Obsolete Love´´
has started.
Episode 2005
Jose Alberto, my love,
what´s the real reason?
l´m beginning to think
you don´t want to marry me.
All right, Esmeralda,
l´ll tell you my secret.
When l find my real father
l´ll come back
and marry you.
And you know why?
-Because l love you.
-Yes.
That´s arelief.
Of course l do.
He won´t come back.
Come on, Araceli,
please don´t cry.
You´ll get us all going.
lt´s probably
just a childish prank.
lt´s all Pako´s fault.
l know it.
lf they don´t show
up tonight...
that bitch and her bastard
will know what´s good for them.
lt´s the wedding of the year
and nobody will wreck it.
Don´t worry.
lf anything had happened
we´d have heard by now.
They´re not in any hospital
and l checked with the morgue.
Grave accusations of corruption
and association with criminals
have affected the candidate´s
latest public appearances.
The voters have seen what
the opposition´s up to...
slandering me,
connecting me with undesirables.
Perhaps because of my fight
against drugs,
juvenile delinquency,
and uncontrolled immigration.
Is that why?
So let them prove their charges
if they can.
That´s how the meeting in the
Basque country
of the presidential candidate
Santiago Paino ended.
He´s the leading candidate
in the presidential race
according to all the polls.
Pako, the window.
According to the girls
we should be close.
Konra, how much more?
Loads, but that´s my last.
Or second last.
You´re out of it.
Juantxo, how much more?
I told you yesterday.
There are some bills left.
To hell with you! I´m all alone.
Man is all alone.
Vanesita...
She didn´t charge me.
Look at him.
He´s crying like ababy.
Guys...
What are we doing?
I´m a drug addict.
I´ve wrecked my life.
And your wedding, Juantxo...
Don´t worry.
We´ll sort it out.
Take it easy, okay?
Sir, if there´s gang warfare
it´ll ruin the campaign.
We musn´t be connected
with any...
Don´t get my balls
in an uproar!
I pay you to solve problems
not to fuck me around.
-Do you want awood...?
-A club. A clubbing...
We have to avoid scandals.
Okay... Call Villambrosa.
He always calls us.
What an honour.
What a surprise.
Marquise...
Allow me.
I received
your very generous donation
to the party. Thanks.
The interests of a country
are above
small personal sacrifices.
Just what I like to hear.
Positive people...
people in favour of things.
Speaking of favours...
I came here to ask one of you.
A favour.
My dear, no favours.
From you I only take orders.
I´m like a fox terrier,
a dobermann,
awild orangutan trained
to serve you.
At your service...
to the end.
Golf
isn´t your game, is it?
I prefer cards. All that
´´swing´´ and ´´green´´ and ´´tee´´.
It´s sissy stuff.
Exactly.
Stick your butt out.
´´Little house on the prairie´´
You want the money but not to
get even with Souza.
And that ain´t easy, Paino.
l know reading´s notyour
thing,
but it´s the second time
this week
I´ve seen your name next to mine.
So the problem
with Souza can wait.
All right...
there´ll be no war.
You´ll have alot to thank
me for, ´´Mr President´´.
I like the sound of that.
Tourino.
Call Souza.
Your men have got the
30 million.
But we haven´t seen
one single gram.
War!
That´s the last thing aman
my age wants.
I trust Fatima.
Tell me where and when.
My men will be there.
Unarmed.
We musn´t endanger our
alliance.
I´ll see you at your new casino,
my old friend.
Tourino.
Tell Pazos to be
at the stadium at seven.
To fix things with
the Portuguese.
No weapons.
-But he´ll have to talk.
-Then he´ll have to learn.
-Hello, what´s your name?
-Rosana.
When do I start work?
Poor princess in captivity.
Can I call home now?
You´ll soon have
your own phone.
Let them go!
But step on it!
We´ll gain an hour
and a quarter.
You don´t know where the fuck
we are.
Cool it, this is
a great short cut.
God! Like in Angola!
This way we´ll get
them head on.
Fire!
Fools!
Hopeless idiot!
Too bumpy!
Bastard!
It´s Mr Souza, ma´am.
Mr Souza.
Yes, sir.
What, sir? Make peace?
No weapons?
No weapons.
I understand, Mr. Souza.
But, sir...
Yes, sir.
What the hell are you doing?
-From now on l´ll drive.
-Cocaine makes you aggressive.
Anxiety, right? Anxiety.
Your driving´s too jerky.
I feel awful, guys.
No more of that shit for me.
You can drive...
after the short cut.
Congratulations, Mrs or is it Miss?
Not all your men are here,
but congratulate them.
They´re real pros.
It´s Miss.
You´re very kind
but I think you´re wrong.
I´d have liked to see
all your men here, too.
And one in particular.
Congratulate them from me.
Let´s not get
into hieroglyphics.
We´re hear to clarify
a couple of concepts.
Our bosses insist we
get along together...
so l´ll make an effort.
lf you tell us where
our money is.
When you give us what´s
ours...
we´ll discuss that concept
in order to discuss it.
I see.
That´s as clear as you can get.
Look, baby.
Here we have a question.
The concept is the concept.
That´s the question.
For example, you´re
an educated woman.
And l don´t object in respective
to that because I´m broad minded.
I don´t go around saying all
women are bitches in heat...
even if I think so.
But what about the concept?
I ´´defer´´ to the facts.
Very impressive.
I haven´t given you so much
thought.
And the concept?
No, I already said that.
Oh, fuck!
What does it say here?
Well, let´s try and
get on together...
or alot of blood
could be shed.
Mr Souzais respected
all over Portugal.
In your country too.
For two good reasons.
(a) he never
double-crosses anyone and b)
he hates being double-crossed.
(a) and (b), huh?
Mr Villambrosa, who is a ´´jentlemen´´.
Told me to sort
this out with pacifism.
So, a)Just as l could say
one thing l could say another.
And b)...
Watch it,
cos maybe you´ll get a ...
Mine´s longer than yours.
Hello.
l told you not to call me at work.
And me too...
Pumpkin Pie.
lt´s going to be a grand night.
Just aroulette or two to
fix up, that´s all.
-Get it ready for tonight.
-Mr Paino
said he had to speak to you.
About the meeting
with the Portuguese.
The board room is ready
for you to sign the agreement
with Mr Souza.
Have you heard from Pazos?
Not a thing, sorry sir.
-Come on, Roxanne.
-Rosana, ma´am.
Locked away, asking for help.
l think she´s looking at me.
He´s got a temperature.
l don´t like the look
of that bleeding.
Lack of sleep, too much coke.
The body´s an enigma.
We have to call home.
-We agreed not to.
-To Pako´s place.
Herme will understand.
Just say we´re okay.
We´re heading back.
The wedding´s the day
after tomorrow.
We agreed we´d get the ring.
Fuck the ring!
Don´t talk bullshit!
Head for the next harem.
Get a hair of
the dog that bit you!
Get the map out,
Konra, hell!
Straight on to the
´´House on the prarie´´.
But first we need a...
´´Reanimator´´, the drink with ginseng.
SPAIN
Killings?
-Which gang was it?
-Three experts.
Experts?
They´re not freelance.
They´re Villambrosa´s men.
l can smell it.
Dos Barros, tell the boys.
Fantastic.
Pity she´s going
to that politician.
Fonseca would have got
much more out of her.
-Something went wrong.
-What do you mean?
There was another gang.
Three guys in a Volvo. Pros.
So, another bunch
of jokers.
At the worst possible moment.
Those boys
have made abig mistake.
Obsolete Love.
Episode 2006
l don´t know aboutyou,
but l´ve made up my mind.
The police should be involved
as soon as possible:
And if not, we´ll call
the Government representative.
Well, l think...
Tere, please.
You´re not going to report my
son missing
like some lost Pekinese.
We must reach an agreement.
Then decide if we call the
police or the army or...
That´s it, the army.
They´re probably just
out on the town.
We did the same before we
got married.
You fool, the wedding´s in
sixteen hours.
Maybe he´s smarter
than we were and...
Don´t be an idiot! How dare
you in front of Begoña and...
Peace, Aurori.
Peace, for God´s sake.
My dears, l think you´re all
abit touchy.
There is something l wanted to say.
l wasn´t going to, but we´re
all one big family.
Yesterday l was worried about
Juantxo and the boys,
so l decided to take action.
l went to see Presidential
Candidate Paino.
His security service is
looking for the boys.
This evening we´ll have all the
information.
You know me.
Always a step ahead.
Look, look.
A democrat on TV
A decision which could be
described as surprising.
After receiving
certain indecent photos,
Judge Rueda ordered
the imprisonment of Presidential
Candidate Santiago Paino.
He is accused of illegal financing,
association with criminals
and paedophilia.
lt´s all apack of lies,
aplot, a trick.
How was l to know
she was only ten?
The parents are to blame...
for dressing them
up like whores...
Oh, my God,
What are we going to do?
-Back to square one.
-Worse.
ln this country imprudence
has a high price.
Pako is to blame. He´s abad
egg and so´s his mother.
We´re going to make a fool
of ourselves tomorrow.
-Pako once asked me for a fellatio.
-A what?
-Me too.
-ln your dreams!
That´s it.
l´m going to call the police and
look for that old slut, Herme.
And see what she has to say.
She´ll be gadding about
as usual.
What apitiful woman.
Whether she likes it or not,
she´ll have to explain.
Whenever you want, my dear.
Sorry ma´am.
She wouldn´t wait.
l´ve been waiting outside
for awhile.
Long enough.
What awful cakes.
From the local store,
aren´t they?
l´ve never really
felt the need
to talk to you as a group.
But now´s a good time.
We were going to call you,
But we thought
you wouldn´t come.
Being invited is less fun.
This is ridiculous.
We all think Pako´s to blame.
He´s a bad influence on them.
That´s true. l´m tired of all
this hypocrisy.
What frankness, ladies!
l feel obliged to reply.
The truth is l was getting
worried about Pako.
Too many hours with your boys.
l feared he was becoming
like them.
An imbecile.
How dare you!
But after what´s happened
l´ve discovered that
fortunately, they´re
just like their fathers.
You don´t mean your husband.
He left you 15 years ago.
Joao...
lt was l who left
that son of abitch.
Look, the wedding´s tomorrow
and we´ve got a serious problem.
lt´s your sons who have the problem,
not you.
And that problem
is their parents.
Serafin, are you going to let
this slut insult us?
Serafin will say nothing
to this slut because he´s a
gambler and whore monger.
What?
Herme... dear... don´t stir
things up.
Or do, or l don´t know.
AndJose Mari,
and Konrado
are demanding clients,
almost fussy,
but exceedingly generous.
You slanderous slut!
Did it never occur to you
that all these cheap
bankers and politicians
you sleep with
Come later to my clubs.
And they talk.
And notvery nicely,
my poor Jose Mari.
You´re despicable.
Get out
of my house or l´ll call...
My best customers?
Yes, l know.
Take it easy, dear.
l´m afraid l can´t stay.
My masseur charges by the hour.
By the way,
l´ve got news from the boys.
They´re...
they´re fine.
Don´t worry about the wedding.
lt´ll all turn out fine.
Goodbye...
´´ladies´´.
Jose Alberto,
l´m your real father.
Bingo, that bastard´s Cadillac!
What a joint, guys.
Well, we´re here then.
We can´t fail now.
That bastard´s got the ring
but it´s not going to be easy.
He may well have a bodyguard.
How do you feel then?
Fucking great!
All set to go.
We have to stick together.
We´ll try and play it cool
lf that doesn´t work...
We´ll improvise.
Yeah, improvise.
As usual.
Well it looks like
he ain´t here.
We´ll have to look elsewhere.
So let´s split up, OK?
l´ll stick around here.
No need to worry about me.
Okay, Konrad.
What about you, Pako?
l´ll check out the bar.
You know, bartenders
remember people´s faces.
l´ll go on my own then.
And be careful...
with the PH.
Could you give me arough
idea of how to play this game?
Of course, sir.
Mr Villambrosa?
Excuse me.
What did you say?
Good evening, kind man.
l was just telling
Einstein here...
that l want to speak
to Mr Villambrosa.
For what purpose?
Look...
l lost my engagement ring
up a mulatto girl´s ass.
Mr Villambrosa chanced upon it.
And l´ve been following him
from one brothel to the next.
So l guess he´s expecting me.
Come in, come in.
What a joker!
Hurry up,
the game´s starting.
Here l am.
l know you, don´t l?
Yes, we have met once before.
Excuse me, sir.
What is it?
Nothing serious, sir.
Can you come please?
lf you´ll excuse me
for a moment, please.
-How are you, sir?
-What is it?
l didn´t realize at first
but unless l´m very mistaken
the empty case those bastards
gave me at the club is
identical to the one we gave to the
Basque who ruined the ´´Russian Omelet´´.
And what the hell does that mean?
Not a fucking clue, boss.
Excuse me.
A small concept.
Do you play with wild cards?
Of course not.
The concept,
that is the question.
Hey, Pazos!
What a surprise!
-Sir?
-Yes.
He´s one of the professionals.
The worst, the most dangerous.
Come on, El Deportivo!
Gentlemen,
l´m afraid the game is off.
Right now,
Mr Villambrosa.
l have to point out
that that ring,
as you well know, is not yours,
but mine.
Now l remember.
You were in the crashed car.
And before that with Vanessa.
We have the same
tastes, young man.
Do we really?
Like hell we do.
A small interruptus.
What´s your father´s name?
Serafin. Why?
The father takes our money
and the son the cocaine.
Damned Basques! Sons of...
Wait aminute.
What money?
l´m sorry but we haven´t
robbed anybody.
That ring is mine.
What´s your game?
Well, young man...
As you can see,
this is aplace for gambling,
so if you want the ring,
and you don´t have my money
to pay for it...
we´ll gamble for it.
Your father seems
to enjoy gambling.
And he´s got balls.
Let´s see if you´re his son
or the postman´s.
Your turn.
Right on!
What apro!
Goddamn kid!
You got balls, kiddo.
You sure do.
But what good are they
if you´re a looney?
Not too smart either.
There´s only one bullet left.
And as l´m the generous type,
l would like you to accept it.
l´m sorry.
l couldn´t let you go.
Bye.
Holy shit, awoman!
Christ! Angela!
My daughter!
What?
Come on, Angelita, my darling.
l´m your father.
He´s her father.
A present for you, dad.
They have a family thing.
They say he tried
to get his leg over her.
And if that happens in a family,
it´s bad news.
Yep.
No, not this one.
So you had my money.
A thief who´s robbed...
deserved it anyway.
Court is adjourned.
Let´s go.
Submachine gun.
Don´t worry about it.
Gentlemen,
we can´t stay for coffee.
That´s 5,650,000 pesetas.
On the same number. 13.
Have you been playing long,
Almost an hour.
Got it! Let´s go!
Don´t spoil the streak, Juantxo.
Look at this.
Are you crazy?
l was born to play this game.
What´s going on?
Why the hell are you dressed
up like that, Angela?
Come on, we´re are leaving.
Even if l have
to dragyou out.
Security!
What have you done, guys?
Guns! Dozens of them!
Think of something, Konra.
Where they least expect it.
The front door.
-All right!
-Logical. l love you, Konra.
l saw it in ´´Starsky and Hutch´´.
They´re thieves!
They´ve stolen the takings.
-Don´t give them the ring.
-No way!
l don´t think they want it.
4 Thieves Killed
by the security services
of the Arosa Casino.
There´re dozens of witnesses.
They´re citizens, and this city
belongs to me.
And the judges too.
Everything could also be yours,
my children.
Your son? How?
Pako, this is papa.
Yes, José Francisco...
You don´t remember because
you were studying abroad,
paid for by me.
lt can´t be true.
Son of abitch!
Listen, Jose Francisco.
Fuck you, dad!
lt was all a...
-set up.
-Yes, a set up.
Pure slander.
Your mother
couldn´t prove it.
l wasn´t allowed to testify
in court.
But now l will.
That´s enough!
l gave you one last chance.
They´re all yours.
So much for
Starsky and Hutch, eh Konra!
-Konra?
-Hey, guys, this way!
Pako!
Pako!
Come on! ldiot!
Come on!
lt´s locked.
Shoot at the door.
The world is blue.
Let´s go!
Konra, that´s not style.
-lt´s showing off.
-l was improvising.
Come on, this way.
What´s wrong?
-Leave me alone, l´m O.K.
-So let´s go.
Go and start the car!
Fuck! l don´t get it.
Pako!
Trust me and start the car
for Chrissake!
You owe me a dance.
Sorry, precious, you
took too long.
A shame. Bye, darling.
Bye.
ls that mine?
That motherfucking pretty boy.
They´ve got the money
and the coke.
They mustn´t escape.
l hate to admit you´re right.
Tires are flat,
let´s use the Dodge.
There´s no room for you, fool!
lf you squeeze over:
They´re getting away!
They won´t get far.
Fatima, you always
surprise me.
Give me that!
Carmina?
l´m quitting this.
lt´s too stressing.
No, not interesting,
stressing.
Hey, Carmina.
You were right.
But l wouldn´t listen
l have to admit it
with a glass in front of me
and my head feels heavy,
how l suffer.
l swear l need to return.
Thank you
for coming, Governor,
it´s a great honor.
Thank you.
What a tragedy.
He went and did it.
l can´t believe it.
My own son.
l have to say it.
We can´t wait any longer.
The shame of it!
l want to die.
l´m going to
say a few words.
Quiet, quiet please.
Quiet.
Quiet!
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you can see
it´s 12:30 and everything´s ready.
But l regret to tell you
that the wedding
will not take place.
Will not take place
exactly on time.
l´m sorry for the slight delay.
Thank you.
Juantxo, that´s no style,
lt´s just showing off.
All right. All right.
-Hello, Sweetheart.
-You had me worried, idiot!
Such a fool.
-What in God´s name...
-Shut up.
You had me worried to death.
For Christsake, mom.
-Watch your language.
-Fuck!
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today
to join together
Juantxo
Ortiz deZarate
and Araceli de Alda.
Oh, Lord,
grant them eternal rest.
What took you so long?
A few problems with your ex.
Yes, l heard about
it on the radio.
No, that´s the funeral rites...
Ah yes, dearly beloved, it´s true...
Juan Jose Ortiz deZarate...
Juan Jose Ortiz deZarate!
What?
Do you take
Araceli de Alda
to be your lawful wife
in sickness and in health,
for better or worse,
till death do you part?
l do.
The rings.
The other one.
Just amoment.
But it must be here.
lt must be somewhere.
What... My God!
has joined together
let no man put asunder.
Your attention!
This is arevelation!
A sinful present.
Hey, Juantxo, there´s amessage
from God for you,
Bless you, don´t worry,
you can sin with this chick.
Sugar daddy, come with me,
l´ll go with you andwe´ll be happy.
Goodvices with me
will be the best
but badvices
are bad for your nose.
Forget the powder and about money,
you don´t need it to be happy.
Listen to this song, blessed be...
...those who sin to be happy.
Be good to her, she´s a fine girl,
a gift given to you by God.
Saintly Creature.
You´re delicious.
Long live the mother
who gave you birth.
lt seems God has earthly troubles,
his celestial channel has no coverage.
He told me l´m his prophet,
a bringer of good news to man.
Enjoy life and carnal sin,
there´s nothing more sacred
than reaching paradise
dancing. lf it can be enjoyment,
singing, dancing, singing,...
Don´t worry, my love.
You haven´t lost anything.
That´s my boy.
Or isn´t it?
ls it?
Oh, how should l know!
