[ Arguing ]
I really want to do this.
It's some of the real stuff.
- God, you're so boring.
- What do you mean, ''real stuff''?
It's for the losers!
Ruth?
Okay. We'll miss--
We'll miss the Rajasthani buffet!
Ruth!
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Ruth!
Ruth, wait!
Is she out of money?
[ Woman ]
No. It's quite simple.
I've decided that I have
to tell you the truth--
for the sake of Ruth's
and our old friendship.
[ Zipper Buzzing ]
Oh, what's that
taken on?
- It's very exotic.
- It's on my Olympus.
Oh, that's interesting.
Mine's a Minolta.
Is yours an auto-flash job?
What am I looking at here?
Prue?
Wh-Who are these people
in the photo?
Ruth.
That's Ruth.
Oh, my God,
I didn't realize.
- Gilbert, it's Ruth.
- Oh, yeah, I can see that now.
She's wearing
the national costume.
I would never
have recognized her.
I know.
Is something wrong?
Well, tell me.
I want to know.
We were just like everyone else
traveling in India.
We wanted to visit
a live guru.
- We weren't serious about it.
-  [ Singing, Drumming ]
She thought it would be
a good laugh.
But oh, it was so scary.
Some sort of freaky
hypnotism happened.
I think they were
on drugs.
- [ Moans ]
-She even burnt her
airline ticket in front of me.
That's when I asked her--
''Is it true,
what they said,
that Baba might
marry you?''
[ Prue ]
No, thank you, mate.
No, thank you.
No, mate.
Thank you. That's fiine.
Thank you.
No, no. Say, Ruth--
Say no!
Say no, Ruth! Stop it!
Ruthy, stop him!
- [ Moaning ]
- No! Ruthy!
Stop!
Ruth, don't!
Say no!
Ruthy!
Ruthy!
Somebody help!
[ Dogs Barking ]
[ Doorbell Rings ]
[ Dog Barking ]
- [ Speaking Gibberish ]
- This is serious.
Tim, please.
It's serious.
Come on. Come on, both of you.
We were waiting for you.
Okay, seriously.
What's happening?
- Who's he?
- He's the top man on the subject.
- He's been very, very helpful.
- Hi, Tim.
Isn't it terrible?
But don't worry.
Miriam's going to get her back.
She's going to India,
aren't you?
- Are you?
- Well, I will if I need to.
- I'm determined to fiight.
- G'day, Tim.
Stop Robbie from drinking
too much, Tim.
- Yeah, that's right, Mum, we'll fiight.
- Don't. Don't.
- [ Chuckling ]
- Don't come here and mock.
I'm close
to the edge, Tim.
Sophie,
sterilized at 23...
to focus on her spiritual growth,
wanted a reversal at 34.
It can't be done.
- So how do we get her back?
- Lure. You lure her.
Couldn't we just
contact the embassy...
- and get her sent home?
- No, you can't.
If she were under 1 8--
which she isn't--yes, certainly...
we could bring her back
under the international convention.
But you've got nothing on your sister
other than declaring her...
mentally incompetent,
and that's almost impossible to do.
What we often do
is steal.
You see, these cults use coercive
and deceptive methods.
Steal them, turn
the deception around.
They make up
their little stories,
we make up ours,
but we get her back.
The next step
is the diffiicult one.
You'll have captured
your daughter's body,
but not her mind.
- [ Sighs ]
- So what do we do, Stan?
We hire the man
I believe to be...
the number-one
exit counsellor in America.
For legal reasons, it's best if he's
in again, out again--
- Untraceable.
- Is there any way...
- it could be dangerous?
- Yeah, it's delicate.
The mind's a damn mystery.
Why do people
believe in God?
Why do people believe
they're in love?
Why do I tell myself
every day,
''You're fat, mate.
Today I'm not gonna eat
cake, butter or bread,''
and by lunch time
I've done the lot?
- [ Yaps ]
- So what did Mr. Hot Dog American cost?
- Ten thousand dollars
Australian, plus expenses.
- Shit!
And what's wrong with number two?
How much did he cost?
Forget it, Gilly.
We're doing it.
She's our golden girl.
My plane's leaving in three hours,
everybody.
-[ Tim ] Delhi's hot--
95 to 1 05 degrees.
- Oh, God!
What if she doesn't
come back?
When she knows
you're dying, she'll come.
Sure.
What's bitten
his little bum?
He doesn't like
pretending to die.
Do you speak English?
Do you know where that is?
That restaurant? Shiva's Restaurant?
It's a fair way,
I suppose, is it?
[ Miriam ] Oh, goodness.
It's busy, isn't it?
- Hello. Give me money, please?
- No.
- Give me a rupee, please?
Give me a rupee, please?
- No. I'm sorry.
I'm from Australia.
I haven't got any, uh, any Indian money.
-[ Horn Honking ]
- You're sure...
this is it?
[ Groans, Coughs ]
Mum!
Oh! Where's your sari?
I was looking
for a sari.
Oh, you're so hot.
- Who's that?
- That's the restaurant's
fake holy man.
This is my friend Rahi.
- Who?
- Rahi.
It's my Sanyasin name.
Hello, Miriam.
-[ Miriam ] Hello.
- Let me get you a cold drink.
Have you ever tried
a lassi?
- A who?
-A lassi. It's a yogurt drink.
- Is it from a bottle?
- Mum, it's clean here.
Oh, yes, I see there are
only a few dozen flies.
[ Whispering ] Is there a toilet
or a hole here?
[ Laughs ]
It's a hole.
[ Gasps ]
Ugh!
''All your father and I want--''
Oh, Lord.
Calmie, calm.
Calmie, calm.
Ventolin.
Yeah.
Ugh!
[ Speaking Indian Dialect ]
Mum, I've got no idea
what Prue told you.
She just got really scared.
Something amazing
has happened to me.
It's so powerful
and so gentle.
It's... hard for me
to describe.
You've got to experience
Baba, Mum.
When he looks at you--
just looks at you--
all your pretensions
and fears just vanish.
And suddenly it's so--
it's so obvious...
how to live
your life--
that it's really possible
to be happy and truthful,
and do good.
How would you feel if I were
to become enlightened?
[ Rahi ] Come and meet him
this evening, Miriam.
It's a beautiful opportunity.
Baba's going to be taking questions.
Just come and see.
He is so full
of love.
Your father and I are pleased
you've found fulfiillment.
Are you?
- How is dad?
- Like I wrote to you, he's very ill.
He had a stroke at Bill
and Puss's farm,
and won't be moved.
Is he gonna die?
Yes, he could.
He wants to see you.
He's paid
for your ticket home.
[ Weeping ]
See, I cry.
I couldn't cry before.
I didn't know
you didn't cry.
No.
Oh, poor daddy.
Maybe next time.
- What do you mean, ''next time''?
- Oh,you know, next time--
in another life.
- Oh, never mind.
- He's dying, Ruth!
- Is he scared?
- Well, of course he is!
He wants to see you.
- We've got a ticket for you.
- [ Groans ]
- Um, it's really the timing,
isn't it, Nazni?
- Who is Nazni?
[ Rahi ] Oh, it's Ruth.
That's her apprentice name.
Ruth, can you
speak for you?
Would you mind calling me Nazni?
It's my name now.
Look, they only initiate
new Sanyasins once a year,
- Fine. Fine.
-and it just happens to be next week.
You're doing
just as you should.
You are pleasing yourself, which is
exactly what we brought you up to do.
No,you just
please yourself.
Don't let our deaths
inconvenience you.
You've got great hair.
Oh, goodness.
That's really kind of you.
No, it's fantastic.
- She's a bit nervous.
- Of course.
How's the hair?
Any scent?
- Oh, it's good.
- Great.
[ Chattering ]
[ Woman Over P.A. ]
The kitchen may be open...
for supper after
the evening program.
[ Sniffiing ]
- No.
- Oh, please.
I'm sorry. No.
I can't be sniffed.
I-I feel sick, Ruth. I want to go back.
- Don't be silly, Mum.
Just walk through.
- No, I can't.
- I feel like an animal.
- Yes, you can. You'll be fiine.
- No! No! Don't touch me!
- You'll be fiine.
- Mum--
- No!
- Mum, don't be silly.
- Excuse me.
- Mum, stop it. You're embarrassing me.
- No!
Mum!
- [ Chattering ]
- No. No. No.
- Hello. Give me money.
- [ Panting ]
[ Moaning ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Children Chattering, Shouting ]
I can't breathe!
- My spray!
- [ Chattering ]
My spray!
No! No drink!
No drink!
Oh, thank God
it's QANTAS.
[ Sighing ]
- We're fiine.
- It's fiine.
[ Both Giggling ]
-[ Screaming ] Hello!
- Oh, my God!
[ All Chattering, Screaming ]
So why is Miriam
so freaked out?
Oh, she thinks I'm going
to live in India, marry Baba...
- and commit group suicide.
- [ Laughs ]
She and dad hate Indians.
You know?
Dark people?
They're just
the main points.
Well, are you
going to marry him?
- [ Squeals ]
- I wish.
- Oh, you wish?
- Oh, yeah.
He's absolute love.
Um--
[ Clears Throat, Laughs ]
- There's, uh,just, uh, three problems.
- [ Laughing ]
- He's not cute, Ruth. Look at him!
- He's poofiie!
He's, like, old!
It's about love.
It's not that literal.
Marriage is symbolic.
He's marrying everyone.
-[Jet Engines Whining ]
- [ Imitating Jet ]
[ Man ]
Sydney, Australia.
Case 1 90.
Did you ever read
about a frog who dreamed
Of being a king
And then became one
Well except for the names
and a few other changes
If you talk about me
The story's the same one
But I got an emptiness
deep inside
And I've tried
but it won't let me go
And I'm not a man
who likes to swear
But I've never cared
for the sound
Of being alone
I am I said
To no one there
And no one heard at all
-Not even the chair
- Fabio here is an
extra body if needs be,
and Robbie will
step in to help too.
Yeah, whatever's
necessary.
Mr. Waters, my name's Yvonne with a ''Y.''
I'm Robert's wife.
It's such a relief
that you've arrived,
because we've
all been so worried.
Now, I'm here to be
of assistance to you.
I'm on supplies.
Do you fiind it hard
to get polite help in America?
- Polite?
- Oh, well, people with lovely manners.
Don't look at Robbie.
He hasn't got any. [ Laughs ]
Where's the guy with the exiting
experience--
uh, Colin--
where is he?
- He's had a family misfortune.
- [ Gasps ]
- His mother died.
- Oh, God, Stan. Was it expected?
Excuse me.
This is not looking good, Stan.
I needed Colin.
I can't begin this work
without a properly
experienced assistant.
Those are the rules.
Well, that's where Robbie
comes into it.
Stan,
come here a moment.
Now, I'm a little
aggravated...
because I could have got
my lady Carol to come out,
and she is good.
Now instead you've
given me two fruitcakes.
One's a ponytail,
and the other's a clown.
Now, exiting is
a precision exercise.
I'm taking a leap with this girl
into the sky.
We put everything at risk
and when we get to the bottom,
I need her parachute
to open.
I need mine to open.
Now, which of these men would you trust
to pack your chute?
- Uh, Fabio. I think he'd do a neat job.
- Yeah, he'd do a neat job--
with his toilet bag.
If he hasn't packed a chute before,
would you trust...
him to fiigure it out?
[ Laughing, Chattering ]
No, no, no, no.
- Yvonne! Yvonne!
- What?
Okay, cop you later.
That was Tim,
my older brother.
He's a gay man.
They've arrived.
She's visited dad once,
but she's restless.
So where do we go
from here?
I'll take a look at her when I arrive,
then we'll start talking.
- Mm-hmm.
- [ Scoffs ]
She's not that easy
to chat to, is she, Robbie?
This isn't a chat.
This is a conversation
that takes three days.
It's a very intuitive thing--
very concentrated.
- So, what is it that you do?
- Um, I work...
a basic three-step system,
where I steer the subject...
toward a breakthrough--
- breakdown, whatever
you prefer to call it.
- Mm-hmm.
Step one, isolate her.
Get her attention
and respect.
- When she's listening well,
I start to push her.
- Mm-hmm.
- The heat goes on.
- The heat?
- It's very traumatic
for the subject--
- Mm-hmm.
which it's supposed to be.
- You want some? It's hot.
- No, thank you.
Step two, I remove
all her props.
Her books, her sari,
if she wears one.
- Is she wearing one?
- Yeah. Actually, she looks...
- quite feminine for a change,
doesn't she, Robbie?
- Shh!
- What?
- Finally, the clouds of her unreason...
burst upon the Earth, there's tears,
sobs, hugs with the family,
and it's over for me.
But...just beginning
for you.
I've successfully exited
1 89 subjects,
with a recidivist rate
of three and a half percent.
There's no one in the U.S. or the U.K.
who can match those statistics.
Huh.
I've failed to proceed in three cases
when I judged the subject...
too psychologically
unstable.
Do you have a wife
or a lady friend, Mr. Waters?
Why do you ask?
[ Laughs ] Well, I bet she wouldn't
stand a chance.
- What do you mean?
- You're very persuasive.
I imagine you could persuade
any woman to do anything.
[ Ruth Sings Along With Radio ]
'Cause the love that you gave
that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough
for you to be open wide
No
And every time
you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
you'd hold me until you died
Till you died
Well you're still alive
And I'm here
To remind you
Of the mess you left
When you went away
It's not fair
To deny me
Of the cross I bear
that you gave to me
You, you ought to know
'Cause the love that you gave
that we made wasn't able
To make it enough for you
to be open wide, no
No
And every time
you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
you'd hold me until you died
Till you died
Well, you're still alive
-  And I'm here
- [ Both Laughing ]
- Hi, Mummy.
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Aunt Puss.
- Good morning, early bird.
- Where are the boys?
- Oh, they're back at the motel,
cuddled up asleep.
- I thought I'd just... [ Kisses ]
- Mmm.
drive out
and say bye to dad.
Oh, he's sleeping, Ruth.
- I think he should be left.
- Oh, don't worry.
I'll sneak in.
I won't wake him.
[ Miriam ] W-Wait, Ruth.
We'll come too.
Okay. I'll race you.
Come on.
Oh, God.
Om.
Om mani padme om.
Dad! You're up!
Oh, my God,
that's great!
That's great!
- [ Clears Throat ]
- What's the matter?
- [ Grunts ]
- What's going on?
You're not sick at all,
are you?
We're all sick from worrying
about you, Ruth.
- What?
- There's someone visiting
we want you to talk to.
- You're bullshitting me.
- We just want to be sure
you're on the right track.
- Hi, sis!
- Hi, Ruthy!
Look, you'll bloody well stay here,
and get this sheet off.
- How dare you!
- Easy, easy, easy!
You liar!
- You lied to me!
- [ All Clamoring ]
I fucking came home! You made me think
you're dying, you liar!
We're here because
we all love you.
- Yeah. We all love you.
I-I love you.
-[ Robbie ] Yeah, sis.
You know--
You know we love you.
-[ Tim ] Yeah, Ruth. We all love you.
- Yeah, of course we do.
Yeah. We love you, sis.
- Where's mum?
-[ Tim ] Keep it tight.
- Come on. I'll take you to meet him.
- It's for your own good.
[ Ruth ] No thanks. Where's mum?
[ Gilbert ] Oh,you want your
mummy now, do you?
Not so tough, eh?
You've met your match in him, girlie.
He's gonna
straighten you out.
He's a great guy, sis. He's real
experienced in religion and stuff.
Just three days.
Just listen to him, yeah?
- Get around. Get around her.
- [ Wails ]
You fucking, lying shit!
- You lying shit! I hate you!
- [ All Talking ]
Let go! Let go!
[ Sobbing ]
Tim! Timmy.
Timmy, let-- Let me talk to you
and mum, please?
Tim--
Please, Tim.
Please!
Please, Timmy, please!
Please. Please!
Timmy!
- Come on, walk over.
- [ Screams ]
Oh, God!
[ Waters ]
He's not there?
No other back-ups?
Nobody else?
Phone's out of range.
It doesn't work.
- Look at this.
- [ Beeps ]
It's a gift. See?
She's coming towards me.
We're on step one.
This could be over in 1 2 hours.
- What about your lady friend, Carol?
- I need someone now.
But there isn't anyone.
I've tried the Rabbi.
I've left several messages.
No response.
What do we do?
Just... let her go?
Yeah, we let her go.
Three little steps, Stan,
but you don't want to fall.
[ Robbie ]
Keep up with her.
[ Stan ]
Well,you're the expert.
I want to talk
to my mother.
Sure.
[ Stan ] You're in.
So,you gonna do it?
Oh, there.
- Why?
-[ Door Slams ]
Why? Why?
Because I think
you've been manipulated.
Maybe even drugged.
No!
No, Mum.
Mum, I'm the only one
of my friends who doesn't do drugs.
Tell her!
I'm sorry, Ruth.
That's what I believe.
I believe you're
manipulating me right now.
[ Weeping ]
- Mum. Mum, Mum?
- Yeah?
Why are you here?
To save you.
No. I mean on Earth.
Why are you here?
What's the point of your life?
Is this a trick?
No! No, Mum.
It's a real question.
Why are you here?
Do you ever think about that?
Yes!
I think about a lot
of things.
I think about the...
magnetic draw of the planets,
their ever-shifting
relationship,
the healing power
of crystals.
Look, mum and dad have spent
a small fortune on this guy,
who, by the way, has
a very good reputation.
- According to who?
-[ Tim ] Let me fiinish.
- No! Go on. According to who?
- So why don't you just do
the three days?
-According to who?
-Just do the three days. We'll all be--
- Excuse me. According to who?
- Okay, to a friend of mine.
-A doctor. Apsychiatrist, okay?
- No.
- May I?
- [ Weeping ]
Come on.
[ Door Shuts ]
Come on, big jump.
Flying! Oh!
[ Laughing ]
Whoo!
That was a good one.
[ Boy ]
It's my turn.
Is it my go?
[ Whispering ]
What do you believe in?
Safe sex.
- Sex?
- I'm an anarchist.
My parents subscribed
to their magazine.
''The Lord's Prayer is muttered
by traumatized, paranoid worms...
groveling
for a meager existence.''
- Traumatized worms?
- Traumatized, paranoid worms.
- So what's happening?
Have they fiinished?
- No.
But the good news is,
she's shaken hands on it.
She's going to do
the three days.
He fiinally promised her
a ticket back to India.
Excuse me, Robbie.
He wants to leave
as soon as possible.
- Well, where are they going?
- Out of the way, love.
Where are they going?
I think he should have told me about it.
I mean, I'm supposed to be
in charge of the security operation.
To the half way hut.
He says he can't work
anywhere near the family.
Look, we're very lucky to have him,
given the circumstances.
We're getting his personal assistant
out from America,
- and she's experienced.
- Mm-hmm.
I'm not going to think costs.
We have to do it.
Mmm. Well, that's all well and good,
but what about the security operation?
What about Fabio?
Do we send him home?
- Well done, dear.
-[ Puss ] Good luck, Ruthy.
- Fuck off, all of you.
- You, madam, watch yourself
with your mother.
Hey, come on, Ruth.
You can talk, you hypocrite.
Where's your little love bomb?
I don't know what
you're talking about.
- Don't engage with her.
- Yes, you do!
Where's my half sister
then, Dad?
- You know, your secretary's
secret little love bomb?
- What love bomb?
-She's in a complete fantasy.
- If this cure works,
I'll be as fucked
a liar as you.
-[ Robbie ] Keep up with her. Go!
[ Dogs Barking ]
To the rescue!
It's my go.
Batman!
[ Grunts ]
[ Screams ]
[ Waters ]
Shoes please, Ruth.
[ Waters Narrating ]
Day one, isolate her.
Get her attention.
Win her respect.
I feel for these kids,
every one of them.
They're lost and they
don't know it yet.
[ Sighs ]
Ugh!
[ Footsteps ]
This is, um,
a complete waste of time.
You're never
going to break me.
That's fiine.
I didn't expect it
to be easy.
You're a young,
intelligent lady...
with strong convictions.
It would be a little disappointing
if it were too quick.
[ Scoffs ] There's no way I can even
listen to someone like you,
who dyes their hair.
- I've made up my mind.
- Oh, you've made up your mind?
Yes, that's right.
And how, may I ask,
did that happen?
- What?
- How did you do it?
Did you
make your mind...
hard and solid,
like a brick--
always the same rain or shine,
nothing gets through?
If I was to say to you,
'' Don't think of pink butterflies,''
you don't, right?
- Or do you?
- [ Scoffs ]
- I'm not thinking of pink butterflies.
- You just mentioned them.
You see,
the mind is a rebel.
It is not a servant.
I'm not the one
who will break you, Ruth.
Your own mind will.
It will seek the truth,
and the truth will set you free.
John, 8:3 2.
It's already heard
the truth.
The truth about your saintdom?
Baba and Mrs. Baba?
Not everything's a posture.
Not everything's a joke.
You're right. [ Clears Throat ]
It's not a joke.
We're talking
about your soul here.
Have you thought
about the damage...
that could be done to your soul,
to your very center,
if you hand it over
to someone else?
To the wrong someone else?
''I feel within me
that spark,
that atom emanation
of the divine spirit. ''
Guiseppe Verdi.
The soul is the match.
[ Strikes Match ]
The spark.
The flame that can
light your path.
I want to ask you
a question.
What, in your opinion,
is the most important task
of a human life?
Any idea?
Is this multiple choice,
or a fake question?
It's an oratory technique.
Have you heard of Socrates?
Yeah.
''The soul takes nothing with her
to the other world...
but her education
and culture.''
So let's get
to the facts.
What are you doing
with your soul?
What is Chidaatma Baba
teaching you?
What's the point
of my telling you?
You already have an opinion.
I want to know
what you know.
Something has touched you,
hasn't it?
To fiind out that,
you'd have to look into my heart.
Way beyond something
you can read in a book and quote.
It is. It is.
It is.
That's--
That's his teaching.
Oh, that's what he said?
His words?
''It is''?
His words.
'' He alone attains unto it
who exclaims, 'It is! It is! '
Thus may it be perceived
and apprehended in its essence.''
The Upanishads.
The Upanishads, Ruth--
an ancient Hindu text.
Feel with your heart,
but check your facts.
I want my shoes back.
No. You agreed to stay.
And I'm going to make it
easy for you.
You can't stand the fact
that I've got faith, can you?
'Cause you're so frightened
and dried up.
But feeling--
just trusting
your heart--
it's beyond you.
I get strength like--
like you can't imagine
from my choice.
That's what we're
really here to examine.
The meaning
of the word choice,
and whether you had one
or not.

[ Yvonne ]
Hello?
-[ Waters ]
Listen, I need clothes for Ruth.
- Oh,yes?
- Can you meet me at the yards?
- Okay, but two changes?
- Do you think dresses or pants?
- You decide.
- Dresses.
- [ Hangs Up ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Squawks ]
[ Rock On Radio ]
[ Squeals ]
[ Panting ]
Put your trust in me
Like I have faith
in you
Put your trust in me
[ Ends ]
[ Door Opens ]
- Have you got the clothes?
- Yeah. The clothes and...
the coffee.
[ Sighs ]
So, has she started
talking yet?
- A little.
- Oh.
Oh, she's so lucky
to have you to talk to.
I've got problems too,
you know?
- Robbie thinks
I've been having an affair.
- Oh.
Yeah. He found my letters.
So... you are?
Robbie's so mad.
[ Laughs ]
Just wants to beat the guy up.
He has no idea who it is,
and he'll never, ever guess.
Shall I tell you?
[ Chuckles ]
Okay.
Me. I wrote them.
Oh, they're so beautiful.
- And they're so romantic.
- [ Laughs ]
- You-- You wrote the letters?
- Yeah.
I don't have sex
with Robbie.
I have sex
with fiilm stars.
I cut out their picture and I stick them
on my bedside drawer.
And when Robbie and I make love,
I pretend that it's...
Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise.
[ Both Laughing ]
I like Sly, too.
Do you?
- Mmm.
- In the dark,
- [ Growling ]
- I imagine that Robbie's
arms and legs are theirs.
- Woof.
- Oh, honeybunch!
[ Moans ]
Oh, that's lovely, Robbie!
- [ Moaning ]
- Yeah! Yeah!
[ Yvonne Moaning ]
Oh, T--
Tom! Tom!
Oh! Oh, God, Matt!
- Matt! Oh!
-Sometimes I get...
a little confused because
I can't remember who it is...
who is making love
to me.
But-- But I think
that Yvonne is-is cheap.
[ Panting ]
Take it easy.
Breathe.
- Into the diaphragm.
- Yeah.
Keep breathing.
[ Panting ]
I mean,
who is going to want me when they know
how many guys that I sleep with?
Keep breathing.
- Yes, thank you. The breathing.
- Down here.
[ Exhales ]
The breathing.
Do you have a web site?
[ Moans ]
[ Moaning ]
Keep breathing.
[ Moans ]
Keep breathing.

[ Waters Narrating ]
Day two.
Apainful day
for the client.
Remove her props,
upset her and provoke her.
So I put the sari
up the tree.
- No more Mr. Nice Guy.
- I want my clothes back.
Juice?
You know,
I thought I was going to have to wait
the longest time...
for the real you
to break through.
You think a sari
is going to change that?
Ten hundred saris
won't hide that.
And you'll only succeed
in tying a big knot around yourself.
- Hello. Would you...
- [ Strikes Table ]
share what you're thinking,
please?
Hello!
Meditating.
I was just meditating on the difference
between you and Baba.
He wears a dress.
He lives the way
he teaches.
Mmm. And what, specifiically,
has he taught you?
To do good.
To be a good person.
And how is that
manifesting itself?
Are you out there
doing good deeds?
- Paying taxes?
- You're a cynic.
Yes. Yes, I am a cynic...
because I investigate crap.
What about the crap
in you, Ruth?
Did you take that to...
the guru?
You're a shit.
You don't care about me.
You don't even know me.
- And I didn't go to Baba
to get my fucked-upness fiixed.
- Well, you'd be the fiirst.
All right, so I hoped
it would help me grow.
- I know I'm not perfect.
- Good, Ruth.
Yeah.
So what do you
believe in then?
Why do you want
to know that?
Because I'm just curious to know
what you worked out.
So you can follow me?
Sorry, honey.
That's not my ticket.
I told you,
don't you ever touch me!
My body is mine, honey.
You're a prick.
You know, you'd be
better off crying.
- Fuck you!
- I don't want to disempower you.
[ Scoffs ]
Oh, yeah?
If you want disempowerment,
you go right back to Mother India.
See how they treat
women there.
Or didn't you notice all those little
ultrasounds blipping away...
so people can go in and say,
''Oh, my god, it's a girl! ''
and flush her out
and abort her.
- They're more honest.
- Excuse me?
They're more honest
in their hatred of women.
I don't hate women.
- I love ladies.
-[ Laughs ]
'' Ladies.''
You wouldn't know any.
I'll bet you date
little Barbie dolls, don't you?
''Oh! You're so brainy!
Oh, you're so big.
Can I suck your dick?''
[ Slurping ]
Can I be alone now?
So, was it
the ultimate revenge?
What was?
Taking your beauty
off to an ashram.
Beauty has
its own price.
- You wouldn't know.
- Yeah, it attracts the shit.
Can do.
Now, I've dated
some beautiful... ladies.
My ex-wife was a model.
- Wow.
- A bit paranoid.
Always going on
about fat people.
She looked good though.
- Oh, right.
- Excuse me?
''She looked good though.''
Yes. Well, it didn't
work that well.
There was a kind of
a hostility between us.
She was always mincing about.
Very flirty with the friends.
Suggesting open marriage--
which we... did.
We both slept around.
- Um,
-[ Airplane Flying Overhead ]
I slept around.
Then we went to India.
There were six of us.
Next thing,
she's off with my best friend.
I punched him out,
[ Chuckles ]
left the bus
and wanted to die.
And that's when I met Singh,
the so-called god.
I shook all over.
-[ Airplane Continues ]
- I totally...
relinquished myself to him.
If I saw any crap--
which I did on occasion--
I put it down to a test--
you know, ''Singh's testing me.''
Then one historic day...
he took me to his private rooms
and hugged me.
I thought,
''I'm special. He's chosen me.''
Very happy.
Next thing, his hand's down my pants
and he's pulled my dick out.
It's just lying there
in his hand,
and we are both...
looking at it.
-And so he starts rubbing away.
- God.
Are they spraying
or something?
- Sorry?
- Is the plane spraying?
Doesn't matter.
So, I'm on my way out of the ashram,
and Singh's standing there.
I couldn't avoid him.
When I drew parallel,
he... hissed at me.
''You show only outer love,
inner love not complete.
- Only delusion.''
-[ Phone Ringing ]
What's that mean?
- It means, '' Uh-oh, I didn't come.''
-[ Ringing Continues ]
He couldn't fuck me.
[ Ringing Continues ]
[ Tires Screeching ]
[ Miriam ]
Hello. How's Ruth?
- Is she all right?
- Yeah.
- She's listening.
She's still delicate.
- Uh-huh.
We're on step two,
so there's progress.
Oh, good, because we had a call
from air traffiic control.
- A pilot rang them.
- Uh-huh. What for?
A ''help'' sign.
He wanted to know if we'd left one.
- A what?
- A ''help'' sign made of stones.
- Whoo!
-[ Robbie ]Jesus!
I said
it was a game.
[ Sighs ]
Whoa! Whoa! Don't!
What? Stop!
Don't!
What are you doing?
What, do you think
I'm gonna break,
like all those other little chicken wing
girlies you snap apart?
You're dishonest.
You wanna sleep with me,
don't you?
[ Sighs ]
Not all touch is desire.
- [ Gags ] I'm gonna be sick!
- But you wouldn't know about that...
'cause you're so busy imagining
how everyone is desiring you.
You're one of the most
ungenerous people I've ever met.
I don't think you could actually...
entwine with another person...
on account of your having to maybe
give something back.
You don't know that.
No, and I don't want to.
We made a contract
which you broke.
I don't have to honor
a contract with the devil.
I'm a regular person
and you know it.
Now, put
these stones back.
Please.
I have had
deep relationships.
[ Dance ]
[ PJ Narrating ] Day two ends
with screening the cult videos.
The cracks widen--
the client falls apart.
Bye-bye, Baba.
[ Video Game, Indistinct ]
Oh, you look wonderful,
darling.
Pink really suits you.
Doesn't she look
wonderful, Gilbert?
You're looking good, Ruth.
Would you like a drink?
What's your poison?
Can I bum a cigarette
off of you?
Are you sick?
No.
- Are you feeling better?
- Off to bed, kids. Off to bed.
Do you want a sandwich?
Oh. You look good.
[ Robbie ] Have you ever tried
that taco food?
Taco Bell. I was thinking about
kicking into that.
It's gotta be
collateralized.
It's lovely to have
you here, darling.
[ Robbie ] You wouldn't know any
Yankee bods want to get into it?
I'm really here
for your sister, Robbie.
Oh, I know that.
Is she doing okay?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
Shift your chair.
Oh. You all right, love?
Here we go.

[ Man Reporting ]
When you meet the happiest
people you've ever known,
who introduce you to the most loving
people you've ever encountered,
and you fiind the leader
to be the most inspired,
compassionate
and understanding.
The cause-- something you never dared
hope could be accomplished,
and all this sounds
too good to be true.
It probably is.
Because these men
are not only...
some of the most charismatic
people of the 20th century,
they are also
some of the most dangerous.
[ Woman Reporting ]
Fanatics have their dreams...
wherewith they weave
a paradise for a sect.

- Good.

At its peak,
there were 20 or 30 young people
in the Manson family.

In their cult alias,
two of these girls took part
in the brutal murder...
of seven people
at the Tate/Polanski house,
including Sharon Tate,
who was eight months pregnant.

As Manson was led back to jail,
newsmen put the sanity question
to him too.
-[ Man ] Are you sane?
- Sane?
- Yes.
- That's relative.
[ Man Reporting ]
Members of his clan have been
waiting outside the city jail...
protesting Manson's arrest.
[ Woman ] They're trying to kill us
as fast as they can.
[ Man ] He cut a man's head off.
Is that the truth?
[ Woman ] I-- You'd better believe
he's going to cut heads off...
when he gets out of here.
He's gonna cut
all your heads off...
'cause that's what
you got coming.
[ Man Reporting ]
On the 21 st of October 1 97 8,
Congressman Ryan was gunned down
at an airstrip nearJonestown, Guyana.
Over 900 bodies were found,
nearly 300 of whom were children.
Children who had no choice but to drink
the poisoned Kool-Aid mixture.
Many of these children
were wards of the state.
Would you like
a freshen-up?
- No, I've got one.
- All right. Okay.
[ Crying ]
Parents-- human parents--
do not possess
the offspring they have.
It's-- It's a very evil thing
for them to think that they are theirs.
My father used to say to me,
he used to say,
'' No boy of mine
is growing up straight.''
[ Gilbert ]
Shut up,you.
He used to put me in frocks,
lipstick, makeup.
He put his wig on me and made me mime
to Shirley Bassey.

I don't want you to talk.
My God, I feel as if
I'm going to split into pieces.
My head is--
is busting.
I'm so confused.
Hold it!
You better know what you're doing
because this is heart surgery.
It's all gone.
It's just--
It's all gone.
The love is-- The love is gone.
The love is all gone.
You're doing well,
Ruth.
That's the girl.
Nobody likes me.
Hey, that's not true.
You don't like me.
Yes, I do.
Kiss me.
No, Ruth.
I can't do that.
I'm scared.
I know you are,
but kissing won't change that.
No.
Mmm.

phone your mother.

- Put it on.
- You take the sunnies.
Listen, are we going
to go in and talk to her?
- Yeah.
- This is a bit embarrassing.
No, don't put
the hat on.
Give me--
Give me the hat.
This hut
is out-of-bounds.
Is she okay?
A bit tender.
Does she-- Does she accept
that they were crap?
I wouldn't say
they were crap.
Let's just say
she's hovering.
Yani's sister's come up. We want to take
Ruth with us to celebrate.
You know,
there's a theme night at the pub.
Absolutely not.
[ PJ ] She can't leave here
until the process is complete.
-[ Tim ] It's just for a--
- [ Screams ]
I think it would
be good for me.
I'll get changed.
That's good, Aunt Puss.
Oh!
[ Knock On Door]
I'm sorry, Ruth.
I shouldn't have slept with you.
I don't know.
It's never
happened before.
All right, of course
it's happened,
but never in this situation,
never with a client.
Don't worry.
It wasn't anything.
Look. I was there too.
I think it was
a little more than that.
I was trying
to be comforting.
You don't think
I was faking it, do you?
[ Indistinct Yelling ]
- Get inside, Yani. You silly boy.
- Give me the joint!
- What's that?
- Give me the marijuana!
Get back.
[ Screams ]
Give me the joint!

- We're gonna be--

-Am I ever gonna see
your face again
- May I have the pleasure?
- No, thanks.
Oh, yeah, of course,
you're on duty, aren't you?
See your face
I wanna see your face
You can have a stick for 20 bucks.
What do you reckon?

Will you get me
another one?
No. I don't think
you should be drinking.

I should.

You drink from my bottle now, yeah.

[ Groans ]
Oh, I want
to go home.
You're out of control.
[ Laughing ]
You didn't seem to mind
last night.
[ Scoffs ] Oh, come on.
Come on.
It's over.
You fucked up.
No, it's not over.
For one, you're drunk.
And two, we're still
in the cave.
- Ooh, spooky!
- But now it's...
a much darker and deeper cave
than it was last night.
All right,
I'll admit it.
In India, I was influenced
by processes beyond my control.
Ta-da! Happy?
Hmm?
Are you?
What about you?
You're playing
with me, Ruth.
What do you like about me?
Do you like my personality,
or do you like my breasts best?
All right, Ruth.
Right now I like your breasts.
It's just the way it is.
You can't stop me from having
sexual thoughts about you.
Oh, yeah? What do you think?
What are your thoughts?
They're private.
[ Chortles ]
Well, not the other night.
How was it for you?
A bit revolting.
You bitch.
[ Chortles ]
It was-- It was interesting,
historically.
- Oh, babe. Come, babe.
- Listen to me!
I had sex with you
because you begged me to.
- [ Chortles ]
- Now,you think it's funny
to insult me,
then I think you're a cruel
and stupid young woman.
Yeah, you laugh.
What about
you kiss me?
Really?
Yeah,
see if I can teach you.
I know how to do it.
I don't think so.
Not so I like it.
Close your eyes.
Now, gently.
And don't open
your mouth too wide.
Take my pants off.
Slowly.
No, no, no, no.
Kiss... around it.
Gently.

Robbie Baron.
Carol.
You're from L.A.?
Not originally,
but PJ and I live there now.
- Where, originally?
- Houston.
Robbie,
how is your sister?
Good. Oh, we got
plastered last night.
John had to cart her home.
Could we talk
somewhere?
Yeah, here.
Did you disconnect
the phone?
Yes. I decided
against incoming calls.
- Great.
- I was going to call you.
- When?
- When I'd fiinished.
- Are you fiinished?
- Yes.
Pretty much.
She's still floating a bit, but--
Yeah, pretty much.
Look, I was here
alone, yeah.
I had enough
to worry about...
without having to think about
who was getting the fuckin' phone, yeah.
Don't go chewing
your stuff off at me!
You're incredible.
I can't believe
what I'm seeing in here.
She's on the couch, naked.
What's going on?
Are you fucking her,
for instance?
- I'm taking you home.
- [ Horn Honks ]
No!
[ Sighs ]
You could damage
this girl.
Oh, come on, Carol.
I know all that.
- It's working. Honestly.
-[ Horn Honks ]
What if I tell
her parents?
There's nothing to tell.
Give me
a couple of days.
No. No.
- I swear to you.
- You've lost it. You've lost it.
I swear to you
everything's fiine.
Oh,Jesus.
One more day.
One more day.
Hmm? What is that? A nose?
You can have it back.
That was nice...
meeting your girlfriend.
She wanted
to smack your arse.
I'm just lying there, acting asleep,
so she covers me up.
I felt like a baby.
Well, you are a little baby,
aren't you?
You should be sleeping
with big mommies your own age.
- You wouldn't have to stick
all that dye in your hair.
- Man hater.
- Look. I'm here, okay?
- No!
All right!
Okay.
Do your worst.
I'm gonna lie down,
and I wanna hear it.
Your absolute worst.
You do what you do best.
Okay, Tampax tool.
[ Laughs ]
- I'm gonna give it you
right up your arse.
- Hmm?
All this ''man hating'' shit
for a start.
Oh, she criticized me.
I'll her her a ''man hater.''
I know what
you want from me.
You just want a youthful
pussy transfusion.
Preferably one you can take home
to show the men folks...
what a beautiful post
you got to piss on.
Oh!
Mr. ''Jeans Pressed,
Cowboy Boots. ''
Is that a uniform
for individuals, is it?
- I want a young man.
- No.
Your physical superiority
makes you unkind.
Yeah?
And that's the whole reason
we're talking intimate.
- As in ''Old salivating slob
seeks slim young thing--''
- Okay.
No, I haven't fiinished.
''Seeks slim young thing
for stimulating conversation.
Excuse me, dear. Let's fuck.''
[ Rhythmic Grunting ]
Keep going.
Go on.
Oh! Do you know what you need?
You need the same age,
fun-loving woman.
I've got just
the girl for you.
[ Laughs ]
[ Humming ]
You look lovely.
Hmm. Sexy.
I bet you bake
great cakes.
Stop it.
You old lezzo.
God!
Getting a bit--
Getting a bit aggressive.
Now, come on, ducks.
We can't have you half-dressed.
Let's get your trousers off, and then
we'll see how irresistible you are.
- Fuck you, Ruth.
- No, you fuck yourself.
But you wouldn't,
would you?
I was young once too,
and handsome.
- [ Chortles ]
- You'd have been impressed.
I wasn't born!
I won, didn't I?
I'm on top,
aren't I?
I'm the winner!
Yes, you're the winner.
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!
So, what are you?
A dirty old man.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, this is so much fun.
I wish my friends were here,
then we could really laugh.
So, tell me
what I am?
[ Scoffs ]
Be kind?
So what?
You don't think I'm kind.
Oh, God.
Now I feel sick.
Why didn't you
just write ''cruel''?
Hey, come on.
No, you're right.
Be kind--
that's the whole point.
Thank you.
I'm very grateful.
That is it,
isn't it?
The only thing.
The Dalai Lama
said it-- kindness.
Do you know what
I'm really scared of?
What?
Don't tell anyone.
No.
Despite all my
strong feelings,
I'm heartless.
I'm hoping
you're heartless enough...
to abuse me
for your own sick pleasure.
Oh, it's not a joke.
No one can be
close to me.
[ Sobbing ]
Do you even like me?
[ Imitating Gunshots ]
[ Groans ]
She was starkers
when I took Carol.
- Who was?
- Ruth.
She was lying naked
on the couch.
He was in the shower.
He'd just been, like, goin' at her.
Takin' off the franger.
I don't think
Mom's paying him to--
Yeah, very likely not,
you big dick.
Did you tell mum?
No, no one.
I thought we could go down.
What are you doin'?
It's over.
No, it's not.
Ruth.
Look.
It's all wrong.
I'm ashamed I tortured you.
It's all defiilement.
I liked it.
I think we should...
be together.
No. No.
I'm lost.
I'm completely lost.
We're holding hands. We're--
We're sticking together.
Why-- Why don't
we get married?
Why don't you marry me?
- Be my bride.
- No.
- Yes!
- No! No!
Don't! Don't!
You're mad.
Let me go!
Get off me!
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Leave me alone! You're hurting me!
- Stop!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
Shit. Oh, shit.
Now, if she was naked,
okay, it's her own affair.
Hey, look.
It's your car.
It's him. See?
- Robbie, pull up!
- No. I'll ram him. He's dead meat.
- Have you seen Ruth?
- No.
- Where is she?
- Has he got lipstick on his face?
- She's not at the homestead?
- No.
No, she isn't.
So what happened?
What's happened is
that she's taken off,
and we'd better get everyone out
to look for her.
- I'm trying the tavern.
- What do you want us to do?
You stay at the hut.
She might return there.
- I'll come with you.
- No. No, it's not necessary.
It's okay.
I'd like to come.
I hope she's been
behaving herself.
You know, young girls
can be big teasers.
I should know.
Have you ever wondered
where the dead birds go?
-[ Pounding ]
- I mean, when they die,
do they just...
- drop out of the sky?
-  [ '' Hark! The Herald Angels Sing'' ]
Actually, I feel
very sorry for Ruth.
Because I've been
thinking about it,
and I don't think
there's anything out there.
Just a big,
dark nothing.
All we really have
is each other.
[ Pounding ]
- Stop. Stop!
-[ Pounding ]
Stop the car!
Oh, my God, I know where she is!
This is so dangerous.
Ruth, it's Yvonne.
I don't care who you believe in,
you've gone too far.
You could have killed yourself
in this heat!
[ Radio ]
Underneath the mistletoe
last night
- Oh. Okay. Okay.
- Help me.
-[ PJ ] Ruth!
It's all right, Ruth.
- No!
- No!
- Ruth!
- It's okay!
- No!
I saw mommy pick up--
No, wait!
I'm not in yet!
- Underneath the mistletoe
last night
- No! No!
No!
- What a laugh
it would have been
- We could go to India!
No! No!
[ Screams ]
Come on, stop!
Kissin'Santa Claus
last night
I saw mommy kissing
Santa Claus
No! No!
We'll see Baba.
He can help us.
Why not?
You and me
at the ashram.
I love you!
I love you.
I love you!
You-- You and I
at the ashram.
- Bang Bang!
- Yes. All right.
Okay.
Thank you. Bye.
- Grandma, bang bang!
- Stan says to stay calm.
He's frankly a little worried
that they've left the hut.
[ Clapping ]
What a genius!
Do you know what
could happen, Miriam?
- Sh-She could be lost?
- She could be found.
Found wandering the effiing highway
by the police,
who will come here
to arrest us all.
Why aren't we checking the roads?
It's a good idea.
Bill-Bill?
[ Gilbert ]
We'll get Robbie and Tim.
I think we should say
The Lord's Prayer.
[ Miriam ]
This is such a mess.
[ Sprays Inhaler]
Our Father
who art in heaven...
hallowed be Thy name.
Oh God, is the valley
of death in this?
No, it's
the daily bread.
Oh, I don't even know the words.
He won't listen.
Which art in heaven
Hallowed be
Thy name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done
On earth
As it is in heaven
[ Grunts ]
It's not the way you smile
that touched my heart
Sha la la la la
It's not the way you kiss
that tears me apart
Oh, many nights roll by
I sit alone at home
and cry over you
What can I do
I can't help myself
When, baby, it's you
Sha la la
la la la la
Baby, it's you
Sha la la
la la la la
'Cause, baby,
it's you
Sha la la
la la la la
Baby, it's you
Sha la la
la la la la
Don't leave me alone
Sha la la
la la la la
Come on home
Sha la la
la la la la
Sha la la
la la la la
Sha la la
la la la la
[ Yvonne ]
Oh, God.
I just can't believe
we all trusted him.
I mean,
he so disappointed me.
Oh God, Ruth.
Poor you.
And we'll
make him pay.
Yeah, we'll sue the prick
into the gutter.
Yeah. Use Dave Caughley.
He's bloody good.
Yeah, he's good.
God, he looked shocking.
Looked like the emus had been at him.
Serves him right.
[ Yvonne Muttering ]
Sweetheart
The sun has set
Let's take Ruth to the doctor
because her nose is bleeding.
Robbie, can you
just stop the car?
Blood stained
on an ageless sky
Wipe your tears
and let the salt stains dry
-Let them all run dry
- Can you let me out, please?
All run dry
For time will catch us
in both hands
To blow away
like grains of sand
Ashes to ashes
rust to dust
This is what
becomes of us
[ Ruth ]
Dear PJ,
- [ Kids Chattering ]
-my dad fiinally did
run off with his secretary.
So, mum came back
to India with me,
and we're working at the Animal Help
and Suffering inJaipur.
[ Horn Honking ]
I'm still chasing
the truth.
I've read the complete
Bhagavad Gita.
[ Chattering ]
Oh, I've got a boyfriend.
[ Laughs ]
He's a little jealous of you.
[ Laughing ]
I don't know
why I love you.
But I do...
from afar.
Something--Something really did
happen, didn't it?
Ruth.
[ Baby Crying ]
[ PJ ]
Dear Ruth,
Thank you.
It was good to get
your card and news.
What about this?
Carol and I are
the proud parents of twins.
She's forgiven me,
patched me up,
- chewed me out, nursed me.
- Come on.
I'm writing a novel,
my second.
It's about a man
who meets his avenging angel.
Ha!
Could you
really love me?
I'm amazed.
Even if it is from far, far away,
I wear it like a blessing.
About the ''something''--
yes.
Didn't you notice
it just about killed me?
Yours any time--
don't tell Carol--
PJ.
