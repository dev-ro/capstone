Death of a legend.
It is with sorrow that the country learned...
...this week of the death
of Aristide Leonides.
Born in 1871, he arrived from Greece
aged 23 without a penny in his pocket...
...and opened his first restaurant
that same year.
The first hotel was ready
for business not long after.
His first wife,
Lady Marcia de Haviland, died young.
But Mr. Leonides wasn't alone at the end.
He is survived by his young
and lovely American widow, Brenda.
Here is Mr. Leonides
with his eldest granddaughter, Sophia.
Friend or foe, no one could dispute...
...Aristide Leonides was a colossus
of his time.
- Good morning, Miss Ackroyd.
- Good morning, Mr. Hayward.
- Mr. Hayward.
- Yes?
We have a client. She's waiting inside.
- She?
- Wouldn't give a name.
Hello.
Hello, Charles.
I'm sorry to surprise you like this,
but I wasn't sure you'd agree to see me.
I'm really very sorry to hear your news...
...Miss Leonides.
I wanted to be incognito in Egypt.
I was surprised
when you left the diplomatic...
- ...for this.
- Detection?
It's a family business.
What exactly can I do for you, Sophia?
I believe my grandfather was murdered.
Murdered?
He died of a heart attack,
but I suspect foul play.
And what makes you suspect that?
I found him.
And the doctor was acting oddly,
and he wouldn't sign the death certificate.
And there's going to be a postmortem.
- Right.
- I want you, Charles...
...to come down to the house and look
into it before the police get involved.
For a fee, of course.
It'd be a little unethical for me
to take this case, Sophia.
- I'm sure you can understand that.
- You want to know why I left?
- No. I...
- I didn't want you...
- ...to become involved with my family.
- The penniless junior diplomat...
...not what they had in mind
for you, is that it?
- Don't...
- Now you do want me involved?
Now things are different,
very different indeed.
Not for me.
I believe the killer may still be
in the house.
I'm frightened, Charles.
You, frightened?
Yes.
Well, then you should go straight
to the police.
Miss Ackroyd,
Miss Leonides will be leaving now.
You should at least think about it.
Miss Leonides.
You've met her before?
- Briefly, in Cairo.
- Oh, come on, Mr. Hayward.
Just think of the publicity.
You can't afford to refuse this job.
What exactly is your interest
in the Leonides death, Charles?
I've been approached
by a member of the family.
I don't know what you think you're playing
at with this gumshoe business.
You should be here at the Yard,
like your father.
- A hard act to follow.
- You can say that again.
What do you want?
The examining doctor noticed
the extreme contractions of the pupils.
He ran some tests and concluded
the cause of his death was eserine.
- It's...
- Also known as physostigmine.
Used in eye drops to treat glaucoma...
...or, if injected directly
into the bloodstream...
...would cause a heart attack.
Your father used to lean forward like that.
Leonides was a diabetic. It's possible
the eserine was switched with his insulin.
- Were the eye drops his?
- Yes.
So the switch could have
just been an accident.
Could have been. There's not much of a case.
And the family lawyers would
tear us apart if we tried to make one.
What about the press?
Once the Yard breathes "murder,"
the press will be all over it.
And these people relish their privacy
as much as they relish their money.
This member of the family, he or she?
She.
Above suspicion?
All right. Two days.
Then I call in the hounds.
Look, I haven't decided to take the case yet.
Then what are you doing here?
I don't see why a family
like this would talk to me.
Open the gates even.
I have no authority. I...
Leonides had a lot of powerful friends.
He also had powerful enemies.
He was a controversial figure.
Take all these notes to your office,
think about it.
Wait for my call.
Thank you, Charles.
For what?
For taking me dancing tonight.
Charles Hayward.
Is everything all right?
Do you know anything about moles?
No. I'm afraid not.
I have an arsenal of other weapons,
of course, traps, poisons.
Sometimes I use holly. It pricks them,
do you see? Makes them bleed.
Moles are hemophiliacs. Little bleeders.
Like some European royals.
Though I do find a shotgun
best expresses my feelings.
Are you Sophia's sleuth?
Yes. Charles Hayward.
- I'm sorry, the gates were open.
- Yes, we were expecting you.
Edith de Haviland.
My late sister was Aristide's first wife.
Sophia believes there's a Borgia
living under this roof.
How dramatic.
Josephine!
Josephine!
- Josephine!
- Josephine, Nanny's calling you.
- Come along.
- All right, Aunt Edith!
Come along now, there's a good girl.
Come on.
Get off of me.
Go on.
I don't know what we'd do
without our old nannies.
Faithful.
I chose this one myself years ago.
Hello, Charles.
Sophia.
How do you two know one another?
We met in Egypt,
when I was out there with Sotheby's.
He saved my life. Didn't you, Charles?
Well, her horse bolted on the way
to the pyramids. I managed to stop it.
I'm sorry?
Sophia has never been
run away with in her life.
By a horse or anything else, come to that.
- Charles likes to think he rescued me.
- Oh, the dear boy.
Aunt Edith came to nurse Grandmama...
...and when she died, considered it
her duty to help bring up the boys.
Save them from Grandpapa's influence.
They fought like cat and dog,
Aunt Edith and Grandpapa.
She told him he was a slimy foreigner
with his fingers in the till.
And he told her she was
a narrow-minded, xenophobic snob.
Actually, I think she secretly adored him.
Here's the man himself.
I know what you're thinking.
The gorgeous daughter of an earl...
...and a near midget immigrant,
an unlikely match.
But Granny fell for him.
There was something exotic and vibrant
about him that appealed to her.
- Was the marriage happy?
- Very happy.
Of course, their respective friends didn't
mix, and her parents couldn't stand him.
Well, then why didn't they stop it?
Nobody could stop Grandpapa, Charles.
This is where you found him?
Can you walk me through it?
I brought him up breakfast.
Was that usual?
Yes.
Morning, Grandpapa.
He liked me to do it.
And why was that?
We had a special bond.
Grandpapa?
Special bond? How do you mean?
Nothing.
We just got along well, that's all.
This was his bathroom.
And that's the fatal cupboard.
- And through there?
- His wife's room.
- Brenda.
- Yes.
In my office, you said...
Well, you said you were frightened.
We're a very odd family, Charles.
There's lots of ruthlessness in us
and different kinds of ruthlessness.
That's what's so disturbing.
The different kinds.
- What do you mean?
- Exactly what I said.
If you need anything,
you know where to find me.
Yes, thank you, Sophia.
Are you the detective?
You must be Josephine, Sophia's sister.
- How do you do?
- I'm very well, thank you.
So you find out people's secrets?
That's the idea.
- Is that your tree house out there?
- Mine and Eustace's.
He's my older brother.
I like your notebook.
- What do you write in it?
- The things that I know.
I know lots of things.
And now that my grandpa's dead, I am
by far the cleverest person in this house.
Anything you'd like to tell me?
Not yet. You see, I read detective stories.
And a good detective will take time
to gather evidence...
...and question everyone
before solving a case.
The murderer is never the one
you initially suspect.
- Magda is ready for you now.
- Magda?
She doesn't like me calling her "Mommy."
She says it ages her.
There's no place like home.
Oh, these shoes are all wrong.
Much too frivolous for the occasion.
- I apologize, Mr. Hayward.
- No.
Oh, God...
...I drank far too much claret last night.
It gives me headaches.
Burgundy suits me so much better.
Perhaps you should take an aspirin.
Aspirin?
- Hair of the dog, darling.
- Yeah.
Cure evil with evil.
And what about you?
- It's a little early for me, I think.
- You're cute.
Wait till you have three children.
So you're an actress?
Clearly, you've never set foot in a theater,
otherwise you'd know my work.
I must admit I am more
of a cinema enthusiast.
I see.
Never cared much for the movies myself.
Although, I do have a superb script.
My husband wrote it for me.
Exposure. His first work of fiction.
Full of passion.
The lead character, moi...
...is a wonderfully dark part.
I know they say I should always play
comedy because of my nose, but...
Well, I suppose this murder would give us
a lot of advance publicity and...
- Do go on.
- Is any of this really of any importance?
I mean, after all,
we have our very own Ruth Ellis...
...right under this roof.
Ruth Ellis shot her lover...
- ...not her husband.
- Well, either way, she was hanged for it.
And rightly so.
But are you... Are you saying you'd like
to see Brenda Leonides hanged?
You are twisting my words.
Yes, well... Perhaps I should have
a word with your husband?
- He's in the library.
- Thank you so much for your time.
- Is that all?
- For today, yes.
Good. I'm starving.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
Charles, let me introduce you
to my father, Philip Leonides.
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Charles Hayward.
I knew a Hayward once.
Assistant commissioner
of Scotland Yard. A legend in the force.
My father.
Did rather well for himself,
until he was murdered.
- And they never found out who did it?
- No.
- Not much of a recommendation.
- Father.
Mr. Leonides...
As disagreeable
as you may find my visit to be...
...I can guarantee that it will pale
in comparison to what's in store for you...
...should the police decide to come again.
Can you make an effort now, please? For me?
Seems my lovely Sophia is upset.
We must reach some sort of
accommodation, Mr. Hayward.
Are you suggesting
that we let the roll of a die...
...decide for us?
It will determine whether or not
we continue this conversation.
- Pick a number.
- Will you two stop...
- Mr. Leonides, please...
- I'll assign you "four."
Of course, the odds are against you.
- I'm not gonna answer your questions.
- Well, that would be very bad form, sir.
You think pressure
from some little man at Scotland Yard...
- ...is going to make me talk to you?
- I do. Yes.
Because that little man and I
are trying to do you a favor, sir.
The little notebook. Of course.
- Jot away.
- You are the eldest son.
I am.
How long have you lived here?
Ten years ago, I lost a poker game
to the wrong people.
My father used it as an opportunity
to keep me on a leash.
That's what drove us here,
along with one or two bombs.
My father is referring to some
of my mother's plays, which were...
- ...less than successful.
- Yes. So you wrote her a screenplay.
I am an historian.
I write on medieval art and literature.
This screenplay of my wife's was...
Is a one-off.
She and I live for the arts.
So you play no part
in your father's business operations?
Uncle Roger runs Associated Catering,
my grandfather's flagship company.
Yes, my little brother is the man...
...despite having the business sense
of a mongoose.
But you are not in actual need of...
Money?
No one in this house is
in actual need of money.
Why on earth would you stay here?
Because that was the deal.
Besides, who actually wants to work
for a living, Mr. Hayward?
Has the will been read?
Not yet. Why?
I'd have expected it by now, that's all.
Everyone knows what's in it.
I mean, we're all very well provided for.
So no little clues for you there,
Mr. Hayward.
Thank you, Mr. Leonides.
Yes, one last thing.
If you must.
- You don't seem at all sad, sir.
- I beg your pardon?
Your father is dead.
You don't seem remotely sad about it.
Goodbye, Mr. Hayward.
A little man, Mr. Hayward,
who cast a large shadow.
A very large and rather crooked shadow.
- What are you doing?
- Can't I play detective too?
You smell of cigar...
...which means you've met Philip.
But you don't smell of alcohol.
Is Magda still asleep?
No. I met her.
So you actually declined
the drink she offered you.
Good boy. Keeping a clear head.
Eyes on the prize.
No wonder Sophia likes you.
Lady Edith...
- ...when might be a good time to talk?
- Oh, I'm busy.
Autumnal pruning.
I'm a firm believer in the benefits
of deadheading.
In all seasons.
Clemency Leonides.
Do feel free to come and go as you please.
I'm sorry, the door was open.
You're the private detective
Sophia hired, I suppose.
Charles Hayward.
Continuing our theme of openness...
...perhaps you should be aware that I am
a senior research chemist at La Roche.
- And...
- And my specialty is plant toxicology...
...Mr. Hayward.
I know all there is to know about poisons.
I don't suppose you ever bring
your work home with you, now?
Roger!
Sophia's detective is here.
So tell me, how does it work?
All of you living in this house together?
Who told you it works?
Mr. Hayward.
- Aunt Edith tells me you know Sophia.
- Yes, we knew each other briefly.
- In Cairo.
- No, no, we think that's good, don't we?
- Anything to help lock this slut away.
- Darling.
I can't believe she couldn't wait. He was 86
and she murdered him in cold blood.
Roger, be quiet.
Yes, if you're not careful, you may find
yourself facing an accusation of slander.
How can you defame a murderess?
She made me an orphan.
You are 55 years old, my love.
These things happen.
You're right. I'm sorry.
- No. No.
- Please go on.
You are the managing director
of Associated Catering.
- Your father's company.
- One of his companies.
He gave it to me, but you're quite right,
it is his. Everything is, really.
In my father's house,
there are many mansions.
- And the last time you spoke?
- We spoke all the time. Why ask that?
- It's a simple question.
- What do you mean?
Perhaps we could continue this
at a later date?
Do you know what I'd like to do?
I'd like to strangle that woman.
He doesn't know what he's talking about.
She's a gold digger, first to last.
And she poisoned a defenseless old man!
- Your husband has a very sharp temper.
- Oh, he'd never hurt a fly.
Loving your father is quite natural,
of course, but this borders on idolatry.
Being the favorite child isn't all jam.
- Oh, let me give you a hand with those.
- No, no.
- Please.
- I like to keep busy.
Especially now that the children
really don't need me anymore.
Or not for much longer.
That's the destiny of a nanny, I suppose.
Are you the only member of staff
employed here?
Yeah. Pretty much me and cook just now.
Because of Mr. Leonides' death.
They want to keep the house quiet
and private.
But the servants here usually come
and go anyway.
Who's that with Sophia?
That's Mr. Brown, sir.
Children's tutor.
Go gentle with Mrs. Leonides.
She's not as tough as the rest.
May I come in?
Why, you're not what I expected at all.
What have they all been saying about me...
...all of them down there?
Don't worry, I can guess.
Beasts.
So what if I'm 37.
We married for love.
So, what's wrong with that?
They were born rich. So they think
no one else is good enough.
How did you and your husband meet?
I was a dancer in Las Vegas.
Yes. He had some business there.
One day he walked into the casino
where I was working.
And he saw me crying.
Please, don't think
that crying is my natural state.
- No.
- But I had gotten into some trouble...
...like a dreadful little servant girl.
You mean pregnant?
I was tired of men.
I wanted a home.
I dreamed of someone nice...
...who would make a fuss over me.
Then he said, "Sit down.
Tell me what's wrong."
I said, "I can't, I'll get sacked
for sitting with a customer."
Then he said, "No, you won't.
I own the place."
Your husband owned a casino in Las Vegas?
Well, it wasn't public knowledge.
He was more of a silent partner.
Your arrival here...
...must have caused quite a stir.
I vowed I would be a really good wife...
...and I was.
But we could never get rid
of that family of his.
Always coming and sponging
and living in his pocket.
And what about the baby?
Turns out there wasn't one after all.
It was all a mistake.
Did your husband have
any evening routines, or...
Well, he liked a bit of television.
He would come in here.
This was his chair.
Sometimes I would put on music,
and he would watch me dance.
He liked that a lot.
Some evenings he worked straight
through with Mr. Brown...
...the kids' tutor.
They got along well.
What were they working on?
Aristide was writing his memoirs.
Now...
I have a delicate question for you,
Mrs. Leonides.
I wish you'd call me Brenda.
- The insulin.
- Yes?
Did your husband inject himself?
Yes, but...
That night...
...I did it.
He asked me to do it.
He was tired, he said, and he asked me to.
All right.
Nanny says some of the family
suspect poison killed him.
Yes.
- It is... It is a possibility.
- You see?
I killed him.
The police will find my fingerprints
on the bottle and the syringe.
But the bottle said "insulin," not "poison."
And if I was the murderer, I would
have wiped them off, wouldn't I?
Wouldn't I?
- Sir.
- Sit.
Do you know this woman?
Yes, Sophia de Haviland.
She works at Sotheby's.
She doesn't let anyone near her.
But rumor has it that you two get along well.
- Do you know who this is?
- Aristide Leonides.
Well, this woman's real name
is Sophia Leonides.
His granddaughter.
I guess she forgot to mention that,
didn't she?
You see, we know for a fact
that Leonides was in bed with the CIA...
...since the Greek Civil War.
And we don't know why.
And considering all that's going on
in this country at the moment...
...we want to make sure her presence here...
...and the fact that she's hiding
her true identity...
...are just coincidence.
- I'm sure there's a good reason why she...
- Look.
You're bored in the embassy and you
want to work in intelligence, is that right?
- Yes.
- Then consider her your way in.
No, no, no...
I've been looking for you.
- What are you doing here? This is Mr....
- Aristide Leonides' study. I know.
What are you doing here?
Mr. Leonides gave me access to it.
I can see that.
So you're this private investigator...
- ...and you want to question me.
- Yes.
I haven't met Eustace yet.
What can you tell me about him?
He's what they call now a "teenager."
Rebellious. Angry.
Despises authority. Loves rock 'n' roll.
Thinks for himself too, which is quite
an achievement in this house.
And he doesn't like being tutored at home.
So why is he?
The reason Mr. Leonides gave
was his childhood palsy.
He would be bullied for his limp.
But you don't think so?
Mr. Leonides was really controlling.
You were helping him with his memoirs?
Yes, that...
That's highly confidential.
- Were you with him that night?
- Yes, we worked late.
Several interruptions.
- Visitors?
- Yes. Roger first and then Magda.
Do you know what they wanted?
Well, neither of them
are especially discreet.
Roger was in some sort of crisis
about the business...
...and Magda wanted Mr. Leonides
to finance her film.
Exposure.
Did he agree to it?
No. She does plays that no one sees.
Her husband writes books that no one reads.
What do these people know
about the real world anyway?
Anyone else visit?
Sophia.
She's a little more discreet than the others.
That's the house where Mr. Leonides was born.
I'd like to see a copy of the memoirs.
- There's only the original.
- Then the original it will have to be.
It's gone missing.
There's only one thing for you.
- Does your tortoise have a name?
- Salome.
Mommy did a play called Salome.
It wasn't a great success, I'm afraid.
Salome danced before King Herod.
And he liked it so much, he said that
she could have whatever she wanted.
Are you done with your interrogation?
For today.
Did you find many clues?
You know, Josephine...
...the first round of interrogation
is not so much about finding clues...
...as it is about getting a sense
of who you're dealing with.
You're lucky you're able to talk to them.
As a family,
we don't actually talk that much.
Except Magda, of course.
But all she speaks about is herself.
It must be very sad for you
to lose your grandfather.
Not really. I didn't like him.
He stopped me from being a ballet dancer.
He said I'd be no good.
And I really love ballet.
Sorry to hear that.
Josephine, what can you tell me
about Mr. Brown?
Laurence is having an affair with Brenda.
They write letters to each other.
They're awfully soppy.
- Laurence is soppy.
- How do you know this?
"Oh, my darling, I need you
more than the air that I breathe."
You're making this up, aren't you?
I also know where they're hidden.
I know lots of things.
I listen at doors.
People don't pay attention
to me in this house.
They're way too selfish for that.
But I pay attention to them.
Bye-bye, Mr. Hayward.
Bye.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.
Closing in on your prey, Mr. Hayward?
- Lady Edith...
- Yes.
...I was wondering,
are the gates locked at night?
Religiously.
Aristide was a fervent believer
in the communist threat.
Personally, I can't conceive
of Swinley Dean having a very active cell.
Unless, of course, you count our Mr. Brown.
He is an intellectual, isn't he?
- May I ask you a blunt question?
- They're the only interesting kind.
What's wrong with people in this house?
It is a blunt question indeed.
- Sorry.
- Don't be.
Passion.
It is a hothouse of suppressed passion.
This is what happens when the person
you love the most in the world...
...who you would give your life for...
...is actually the same person
that you hate the most.
I'm certain you understand, Mr. Hayward.
You wouldn't be in this house
yourself otherwise, would you?
Hello?
Brent?
It's Charles Hayward.
Charlie, what a surprise.
What can I do for you, buddy?
Aristide Leonides.
What about him?
What are you doing here?
No, Charles. The question is:
What are you doing now?
Not scared, are you?
- Not in the least.
- You should be.
So you like it?
Let's go upstairs.
This is what my grandfather wanted me
to keep him up to date on.
What the young people were doing.
The music scene.
He believed that this was the future
for his business. Leisure, entertainment.
I suppose that's what he meant
by the world going soft after the war.
So this is what Vegas was about?
I suppose you don't want to talk
about his memoirs either.
You know, I saw a picture of you.
As a ballerina.
That was when I was a little girl,
before I injured my knee.
You were sweet.
Will you shut up
and light my bloody cigarette?
Charles.
This little girl feels like dancing.
Just like in Cairo.
The last will and testament
of Aristide Leonides...
...which was drawn up by me
and signed by him...
...in front of all his family members,
on the 24th of July, 1957.
In it, each and every one of them
is handsomely...
...and equitably provided for.
However, Mr. Hayward...
...Miss Leonides has
specifically instructed me...
...to give you all the information you need.
But I hope I can rely
on your absolute discretion here.
Of course.
Because, as I just told the family,
we realized only this morning...
...that this will has no signature.
Everyone present,
myself included, saw him sign...
Or, rather, we thought
we saw him sign it. But...
He died intestate?
So it would appear.
But if he died intestate, then...
Then the primary beneficiary of the will
is, of course...
...the second Mrs. Leonides.
Brenda.
Indeed.
Josephine!
Josephine!
Thank you.
Nice setup.
What do you want?
I know about the will.
And I also know that you had...
...a heated discussion
with your father the night he died.
Now, a stab in the dark...
...but might it have concerned
the imminent collapse...
...of Associated Catering?
You're an extremely intrusive person,
Mr. Hayward.
I thought you could do with some...
Now, what was it?
One last attempt to get your father
to bail you out? And he refused?
It's made out to Associated Catering,
for 2 million pounds.
This sort of money would solve
most people's problems.
Not mine.
All I ever did was let him down.
But he always forgave me
and bailed me out. Again and again.
That night, Clemency told me
to destroy this check.
That it would be the end of me if I were
to accept one more penny from my father.
But I'm not as strong as my wife.
The next morning...
...he was dead.
There you are.
Don't creep up on people like that.
People who eavesdrop
seldom hear good of themselves.
And put that horrid notebook away.
- Hello?
- Buddy, you're being followed.
Yes, I know. I thought it was you.
Oh, you could never spot us that easily.
So do you have anything for me?
Only if you tell me
why you left the Foreign Office.
You were promising.
And the free world needs people like you.
The free world. Please.
Yeah, all right.
Leonides was a friend of ours.
But I don't think his death
has anything to do with that.
What was your business with him?
He helped us in Greece during the civil war.
Financed a bunch
of anti-communist organizations.
Gave money to the right people.
In return, we helped him out in the States.
Helped him cover up
some of his shady businesses.
Which explains Las Vegas.
He was a strange cat.
Saw himself as the next
Alexander the Great or something.
- He had a thing for empires.
- And the British Empire is falling apart.
Every dog has his day.
- And that's it?
- Look...
...everybody wants to know who killed him.
And nobody has a damn clue.
But we're talking about a lot of money.
This guy was everywhere, like an octopus.
So who benefits from his death?
It's just far too obvious.
Maybe your friend in the car could help us.
Hi. I believe we have a mutual friend.
- Sorry?
- Your wife.
What? What can...
- Hey.
- Get off, get off, get off!
Hey, calm down.
We just want to know who you are.
Hey, hey. There we go, come on. Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Charles, meet Sergeant Glover
of Scotland Yard.
Easy. Easy, big fella.
- What on earth were you thinking?
- Charles, it's not as bad as it looks.
I would have thought, considering
your friendship with my father...
...you would have more trust in me.
I swore I would look after you
should anything happen to him.
You're saying to me that this...
This clown of a man...
...was there to protect me.
- If anyone's the clown...
- Shut up, Glover.
He's right, you are a clown.
Now, get out of here.
Charles, you have to understand,
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
There's politics involved here.
It's sensitive.
- And with your past...
- I'm sorry, my past?
- In Cairo.
- I was a diplomat.
Of course. And I'm a duchess.
Now, give me something,
so I can still have faith in you.
All right.
Any of them could've done it.
They all had means. They all had opportunity.
Motive?
Anger, jealousy, love, greed. Take your pick.
So no communist?
No Las Vegas mafia?
No CIA conspiracy?
We're investigating too.
Quietly.
But you can go in the house
without a warrant.
Get back in there and find out
who killed the bloody midget.
Brenda admits she gave the fatal injection.
But anyone, anyone,
could have swapped out those bottles.
- Including her.
- Yes, including him.
Tell me, how would Brenda
have known the consequences...
...of swapping out the insulin
with the eye drops?
Oh, we all knew about that.
He made a point of telling us
about it at his 86th birthday party.
He went into great detail explaining
how we could do away with him.
Yes, he had a very twisted sense of fun.
You met with him the night he died.
Yes, he wanted to discuss family matters.
Family was pretty much everything to him.
Well, you can tell me about Laurence Brown.
Did you know he was having an affair
with Brenda?
I suppose I knew something might be going on.
And what if your grandfather had found out?
- I'm quite sure he knew all about it.
- And he didn't mind?
It's highly likely
that when he selected Laurence...
...as tutor to his grandchildren,
he was also selecting him as Brenda's...
- Yes.
- To keep Brenda happy.
Then I suppose you know
he didn't sign the will?
Well, yes! That was a surprise.
So Brenda gets the lot.
Including, I would say,
the final nail in her coffin.
What's the hurry, Josephine?
I hear you're making progress. But you
won't be the one who solves this case.
If anything, you're Watson.
Is that right?
Well, why don't you enlighten me, Holmes?
- Tell me about those letters.
- What letters?
You know, the ones that Brenda
and Laurence Brown...
- ...are supposedly writing to each other.
- Oh, I made that up.
I often make things up.
It stops me from getting too bored.
I don't believe you. I know you know things.
Sometimes people don't know what they know.
- There you are.
- What do you want now, Nanny?
Your hot chocolate's ready.
Look, your ballet shoes are all muddy.
I don't like hot chocolate.
You only make it so you can drink it.
It will give you a good night's rest.
Not everything they say
on television is true.
Just leave me alone.
- Mr. Hayward.
- Afternoon.
- What?
- I'd say we're due another murder.
Don't you think, Watson?
Another murder, Holmes?
Well, there's always a second murder.
Someone who knows something is bumped off...
...before they can reveal what they know.
I didn't say you could come in.
I'm sorry, I thought maybe
you couldn't hear me knock.
I know every other ass in this house
is just begging to talk to you, but I'm not.
You're boring me.
Your tutor, Mr. Brown,
what do you make of him?
I reckon Mr. Brown's
doing all right for himself.
I wouldn't mind, would you?
Though it's a bit weird,
fancying your grandfather's wife.
Oh, I'm sorry, did I shock you?
No, it's just, the fact is,
everyone fancies Granny.
Uncle Roger has the hots for her.
You can tell.
It must have amused Grandpa...
...to put that cat amongst the pigeons
and watch the feathers fly.
Now, I have a question for you,
Mr. Detective.
I can't imagine there's anything that
I can tell you, you don't already know.
Oh, yeah. Did you screw my sister in Cairo?
Now, your grandfather has just died.
A good thing, really.
It's one less capitalist.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't hear you. Did you screw my sister?
Are you really happy
your grandfather is dead?
He was a control freak
who played with people's lives.
He was a sadistic pig,
and his hubris was intolerable.
And he got what he deserved.
I don't believe it was Brenda.
She's not clever enough.
She might have been set up though...
...by someone clever.
You really seem to make a habit
of barging in, don't you?
- What do you want?
- It won't take a moment.
When Brenda was first introduced
into the household...
...did it rather upset the apple cart?
The apple cart remained upright, as I recall.
Nor was there any tasting of forbidden
fruits if that's what you're insinuating.
Now, you really have to go.
You forgave him?
There was nothing to forgive.
It was a childish infatuation.
Yes, I see. So love turned to hate?
The reason my husband hates Brenda is
because he thinks she killed his father.
- It's very simple.
- Yes, but you don't. You know different.
- I must insist.
- I haven't finished.
That night your husband showed you
the check his father gave him...
...you told him to tear it up, but he didn't.
Did you realize there would never be any
escape until your father-in-law was dead?
Yes. That exact thought went through my mind.
But now he is.
So we can.
One more thing.
Sophia?
What are you doing?
Burning evidence?
Chrissake!
A reporter from The Times just called.
If he knows, soon everyone will.
There was nothing of interest
regarding his murder...
...in these memoirs, trust me.
Trust you?
During the war, he branched out.
Bombs.
First you destroy a city,
then you go in afterwards and rebuild it.
I'm not sure
the world needs to know about that.
That and other things.
And that's for you to decide, is it?
Yes, it is.
So, what are you going
to do about it, Charles?
What do you know about trust anyway?
What's wrong?
Car won't start.
How very inconsiderate of it.
Plenty of room here. We can
have someone fix it in the morning.
Are you sure?
Aunt Edith, I've been looking
all over for you. Where have you been?
None of your business, dear.
Fancy meeting you here at this late hour.
My car seems to have broken down.
Oh, what a shame. Such a nice car.
For a penniless plod, anyway.
That's the problem.
I can't afford it, thirdhand.
Would you like me to take you home?
I've just invited Charles to stay the night.
Now...
...that's a much more interesting idea.
Haven't seen this many people around
the table since before Granddad died.
What's she doing here?
- Nanny?
- Please don't make me miss all the fun.
- No such thing in this room, pumpkin.
- Josephine.
I put her to bed, Lady Edith.
Well, clearly, she escaped.
"Escaped"? She is not a prisoner.
I don't want to go to bed, Aunt Edith.
I want to stay.
I'm afraid you have no choice, my dear.
With a smile, my little changeling.
You'll have to tell me everything, Watson.
It's Switzerland for that young lady,
the sooner the better.
It's not good for her to be caught up
in this horrid business.
You wanted them to grow up here.
I wanted some discipline in their lives.
I didn't think your father would control
their every move.
Was I to know
that I'd be cheated of motherhood?
Sometimes I wonder why you bothered
to have children at all, Magda.
Soon as they were born,
you were off to repertory...
...in the remotest provincial theater
you could find.
There's something deeply moving about
a spinster's love for her sister's offspring.
Moving and faintly desperate.
Congratulations, Mother.
Another grandstand performance.
Don't worry, Sophia.
I've lived through two World Wars.
I can survive Magda's drunken,
little slings and arrows.
Josephine is right.
Your presence seems
to have brought everyone together.
With one notable exception.
The smell of blood.
Now, I didn't realize
that your arrangements...
...extended to board and lodging,
Mr. Hayward.
Father, Charles is my guest.
Guests don't snoop around, looking
on their hosts as potential murderers.
I'm sure he thinks of all of us
as potential murderers.
You can hardly blame him.
Well, then, Charles.
How about a blunt question for you, then?
What are murderers like?
Well, you.
And me.
Everyone.
Hot-blooded.
Cold-blooded.
They do share one or two traits.
Vanity.
A distorted morality.
A lack of empathy.
And murderers tend to feel
that they are above...
...the rules and laws
that govern ordinary mortals.
Well, that description fits
every member of this family.
I don't envy you your job.
Nonsense, it's the easiest job
in the world. Open and shut.
- I shall go to my room now.
- It's good of you to have come at all.
Considering you couldn't
even show up at his funeral.
I wouldn't have been able to stand it.
You heard the weather forecast, you mean?
None of us enjoy funerals,
but you could at least pretend.
You're getting all our money.
What kind of spell did you put
on that poor, poor sweetie pie?
Aristide always loved dancers. You know that.
You weren't a dancer.
You were a girl on a stage in a bikini.
Which doesn't explain
why he didn't sign his will.
I've said all I have to say to Mr. Hayward.
Surely we don't need a Pl in the house
for us all to tell each other the truth.
Oh, Magda. Isn't that a line
from The Last of Mrs. Cheyney?
No, it's not.
But if you must know,
it's from a thriller I did at Frinton.
I rest my case.
Admit it, Brenda.
You'd rather be with Laurence.
Are you two in this together?
Of course they are.
I hope all this money won't put
a strain on your principles, Mr. Brown.
Brenda has her very own Red under the bed.
Is that where you keep him?
You don't know me. None of you do.
Oh, I think we do.
At least we know your type.
Oh, dear, Mommy's in wrecking mode.
I didn't murder him. I miss him.
And any one of you could have
wished him out of the way.
- What on earth do you mean?
- The film script.
The reason he didn't back
the film script, I'm quite sure...
...is he knew it would be a triumph
and lead to our independence.
Right. He didn't even read it.
- What?
- I did.
So it's all your fault.
No. I actually said it was pretty good.
But he said he'd toss a coin for it,
as there were no dice.
And he asked me to call.
And you lost.
And he said it was poetic justice.
You see now why I didn't want you
involved with my family?
Come on, Sophia.
There's nothing like a real heart-to-heart.
Assuming one could find
any real hearts under this roof.
That's the point.
Unlike all of you, I actually made him happy.
That's why he gave me all the money.
Well...
...I'm sorry to interrupt
this oh-so-sweet family reunion...
...but now I have something to say.
Josephine could be right.
It is a fun evening after all.
Not especially.
Roger and I are leaving...
...for good.
- Anywhere nice?
- Barbados.
Plenty of toxic plants for Clemency.
We intend to create,
fund and manage an orphanage.
Some people have all the luck.
I'd have thought any need you had
for children was fully satisfied by Roger.
Don't you ever get tired
of sounding superior?
Ruin the family business
and bugger off to Barbados.
How very like my brother.
Better than losing everything
playing baccarat on the Riviera.
Poor Roger.
Who has no idea how fun life can be.
He chose me.
Yes.
And every single day, I wonder why.
But I never asked him...
...to love me more than he loved you.
Yes, Eustace?
I have a question for Sophia.
Did Mr. Hayward screw you in Cairo?
No, it's just he seemed unsure
when I asked him.
Don't be vulgar, Eustace.
That's quite a sense of the dramatic.
Can you explain what relevance that has
to our discussion, my darling boy?
It is actually very relevant.
What if she's the killer?
And they're in it together.
You see?
They're coming after you now.
These people.
They bring out all the evil.
Oh, Charles. I'm so frightened.
What will happen next?
The press, will they be dreadful?
Don't give any interviews.
You ought to get yourself a lawyer
to tell you what to do and what to say...
- ...what not to do and what not...
- I need someone like you.
Just hold tight.
- Keep quiet, and it will be all right.
- Do you really think so?
So she got to you.
I knew she would.
Sophia, wait.
Sophia, stop! Sophia.
You're just like the rest.
Take her to bed and be done with it.
No. Stop it.
I can see her side of it, that's all.
Oh, what a high moral tone you're taking.
I have to give it to her. She's got
a special gift for dividing people.
- Now she's dividing us.
- What?
Brenda hasn't divided us.
You walked away from me in Cairo.
Yes.
And did you ever ask yourself why?
Please.
Go away, Charles! You're fired.
You won't be able to fire the police.
Sophia!
Oh, it's you.
I thought you were someone else.
- What are you doing?
- Same as you. Detecting.
- Up here?
- I must go.
Wait.
Josephine!
Sensationalist tosh.
You've been in the wars.
Well, your husband's dogs and I
had a little cuddle last night.
Suits you.
You all right?
We weren't always like this, you know...
...my husband and I.
We used to be
the most glamorous couple in London.
They put our pictures in all the magazines.
People looked up to us.
I wonder what happened.
You know, Charles...
...they're trained combat dogs.
They could kill you in an instant
if they really wanted to.
- Meaning?
- Like the rest of us...
...they like you.
The man from the garage has arrived
to mend your car, Mr. Hayward.
Right.
Oh, these reporters are relentless!
Starter cable. It's missing.
Right, well...
We can keep this between us.
Charles, there's a call for you.
Chief Inspector Taverner from Scotland Yard.
I had pneumonia. Is that a crime?
We are just trying to establish
the facts, Mr. Agrodopolous.
Were you unaware Mr. Leonides was dead?
Until I see the papers, yes.
You think my son should read the death
columns to me every day in the hospital?
How did you know Mr. Leonides?
He helped me when I first arrived in London.
Why?
We Greeks stick together.
That is why.
Look, I don't know nothing.
He gave me the envelope.
When he dies, I take it to Gaitskill.
And you never opened it?
The envelope was closed
with an unbroken seal.
Do you know the lawyers
who drew up this new will?
Not personally, but I'm aware
that Mr. Leonides used them...
...for the other side of his affairs.
And you remain the executor.
Yes, but without enthusiasm.
He settled a small sum on the widow.
The rest of the estate goes
to a single beneficiary.
The granddaughter, Sophia.
Yes?
There's been a call from the Leonides house.
- Yes?
- Someone's tried to kill the little girl.
My God.
The rope was cut half-through.
- Who found her?
- I did.
My father went with her in the ambulance.
Does she remember anything?
She was unconscious.
She must have fallen from the very top.
My poor cherub.
- If you want to go there, I can drive you.
- Well, there's no great rush, no.
Philip says they're doing
everything they can.
Oh, if you want to make your mother happy...
...I wouldn't say no to a gin and it.
You were the one up there
in the tree house last night.
I thought you were a prowler.
That's why I let the dogs out.
Man named Gaitskill is here, sir.
Oh, let him in.
What's Gaitskill doing here?
What a mess.
This is a crime scene, Lady Edith.
It is also my home.
It's so unfair.
What's going on?
- Why is Gaitskill here?
- Ask Sophia.
Let's usher in the reign of Queen Sophia.
Allow me to congratulate you, Sophia.
You are a very wealthy woman.
If I may, I suggest you make a new will
at your earliest opportunity.
A good day to you all.
Madame Sophia.
Your penniless and broken-down old mother...
...begs you for alms.
Spare us a copper, dear.
Your ma wants to be in the pictures.
You're very funny, my love, but perhaps
this isn't the time for clowning.
I suppose you're going to bail Roger out.
- We don't want any of the money.
- I will sell Associated Catering.
- Good girl.
- No point throwing good money after bad.
I was his eldest son.
But to stab me in the back
with his dying breath...
Look at you both.
Desperate and humiliated...
...because now you're going
to have to go to Sophia's door...
...with your begging bowls.
Get out of this room.
Now!
Beware of the vultures, sister, dear.
It's one hell of a burden on your shoulders.
I think we're forgetting ourselves.
Philip, tell me.
How is dear Josephine?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
She's going to be fine, thank God.
No broken bones.
They want to keep her in for observation.
Very wise.
She should not be in this house.
Much too dangerous.
Well, as entertaining as this is,
I've had enough of all the drama.
Roger needs to be gone from this house.
We shall pack our bags, and we shall go.
Congratulations, my darling.
I have a sneaking suspicion
that he made the right choice.
Sophia.
You are an extremely clever woman.
And you are a de Haviland.
I have seen what it takes to operate at
a certain level, and it is not always pretty.
So I want you to remember...
...that lineage will help you find
what's most important in life.
A sense of balance.
Well, my angel,
perhaps we should talk about Exposure.
I'm sorry, Papa.
But your father wrote it.
- At least read the bloody thing.
- It would only prolong the agony.
Papa...
Grandfather said fortunes don't last...
...if they get split between
the weak members of a family.
They should be concentrated
in the hands of the strong.
Did you know about this will, Sophia?
Yes.
Looks bad, doesn't it?
He first mentioned the idea
when things started to get ugly in Cairo.
He said I should come back to England...
...so he could teach me to handle his empire.
That's why you left me.
That and the fact you were spying on me.
"Spying" is a big word.
You broke my heart, Charles.
And I resigned.
- Why didn't you tell me about this will?
- I don't know.
When it didn't turn up,
I thought it was another trick.
He liked to toy with people.
Must run in the blood.
That's what he thought.
He said I looked like a de Haviland...
...but the blood in my veins was Leonides.
So nothing could ever resist me.
I think he may have had a point.
You really believe I could have
murdered him, don't you?
No, Sophia...
Maybe Mr. Brown has taken up gardening.
Or perhaps they were planted on him.
- It's all a bit too convenient.
- It helps your girlfriend's case though.
Worth killing for, that sort of pot of gold.
She's not my girlfriend.
I've taken over this investigation, Charles.
Your position is compromised.
- You should be with the other...
- Suspects.
If you say so.
Those are Lady Edith's secateurs.
And they don't prove anything.
Any knife could have been used
to cut those ropes.
What we need is direct evidence
of a liaison...
...between Mr. Brown and Mrs. Leonides.
This is a joke, Charles.
I'm afraid not.
Well...
...you go first then.
Right.
- Charles.
- Yes, sir?
Is this what
a distinguished chief inspector...
...should be doing in his golden years?
Hallelujah.
"Oh, Laurence, my darling, my own dear love.
I cannot talk about last night.
For if I do, my heart will burst.
It won't be long now
before we can be together."
"My darling...
...is impatience in a lover
a crime or a virtue?
I don't want him to suffer,
not after his kindness to me...
...but I do wish him gone."
Mrs. Leonides.
I have to ask you to accompany me
to Scotland Yard.
I'm sorry?
Anything you say...
...may be taken down
and used in evidence against you.
Do you understand?
But I didn't write this.
- Mrs. Leonides, please.
- I would never do anything like this.
You show them some dignity.
I didn't write that.
I would never write that.
No, it was them.
It was them.
- You must be so happy.
- You'll rot in hell.
You old hypocrite!
Daddy's little boy. You couldn't keep
your hands off me when I got here!
Charlie, help me.
These vampires.
They set us up
because we're not part of their world.
Don't let them fool you.
Charles, please!
They set us up!
Here.
We never stood a chance against them.
Well, I was completely taken in
by her performance.
Mother, if Brenda is guilty,
then she'll hang.
- That's enough.
- She should be tortured.
- You'll enjoy watching that.
- He wasn't your father.
I loved my father. Understand? I loved him.
More than you'll ever love me.
Better now?
I want Brenda to have the best lawyer
money can buy. We'll pay.
She's always been out of her depth.
Poor thing.
- Where are you going?
- An appointment in town, dear.
Well, Charles.
You redeemed yourself at the last moment.
Have to admit,
I couldn't have done it without you.
The evidence is almost
entirely circumstantial.
Usually is in a murder case.
A lot depends on the impression
they make on the jury.
And if you ever need a proper job...
...you know where to find me.
What are you thinking, Charles?
That it still could be me?
And I got away with it scot-free,
with all the money, thanks to you.
And that's why I chose you
in the first place.
Someone could have forged
those letters, couldn't they?
They talk about you in the papers.
How you helped solve the case.
- Good morning, Miss Ackroyd.
- Oh, Mr. Hayward.
This is the making of you.
We can get in the decorators and everything.
Here we are, pumpkin. Run along to Nanny.
Here you are.
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
I've missed a lot. I didn't need
to be kept in hospital all that time.
Don't look so angry, my little changeling.
Stop calling her that, Magda.
How I address my own daughter,
Auntie, is none of your business.
Josephine, darling, you're back.
Tell me, what was Brenda
and Laurence's reaction?
Did they beg for mercy?
I wish you wouldn't talk
about people that way.
They found love letters
on the tower's balcony.
I knew it. I have to write it all down
in my notebook.
Well, I'm off.
Josephine!
I cleaned these while you were away.
And I'm making you
some hot chocolate. It will make you...
- Oh, good gracious.
- Have you seen my notebook?
Why? Have you lost it?
I thought it was in my room. I can't find it.
Well, have you tried the tree house?
I know you took it. You hate it.
All right, little lady, calm down.
I'll find it.
Lady Edith...
...I'm afraid your results do not bode well.
How long?
Hard to tell.
Maybe a few months.
There is a promising
new experimental treatment.
I don't want other treatments.
It's over, isn't it?
Well...
...always leave a party at its height...
...when you're most enjoying it.
Nanny, milk's boiling!
I'll be off now,
if that's all right, Mr. Hayward.
Yes. I'll lock up.
Thank you.
So many people called today.
Good night.
Come in.
Nanny's made your hot chocolate.
I hate hot chocolate and Nanny knows it.
- She only makes it for me so she...
- So she can drink it herself. I know.
Why are you so angry, Josephine?
I'm bored.
And I can't find my notebook.
It's okay. We'll find it.
Charles Hayward.
It's all quiet here, sir.
I was the one who brought the mug up
to Josephine, but...
But Nanny prepared it.
But if she made it for Josephine,
why did she drink it?
Just in time to say goodbye, Mr. Hayward.
- Where are you going?
- London Airport.
- Close the gates!
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- We'll miss our flight.
- We understand...
...how difficult this is,
but Roger and I are leaving...
...so we can lead our lives.
Why on earth would we want
to poison a nice old woman...
- ...who had never done us harm?
- Perhaps she wasn't the intended target.
Oh, excuse me?
Hold on, Mr. Detective.
Can you prove anything?
Can you prove it wasn't a heart attack?
Or a suicide? Are you sure she was poisoned?
The coroner is working on it as we speak.
Nobody gets to leave here
without my express permission.
Clemmy, call my lawyer. I want to check
if Chief Inspector Taverner's...
...conduct is within the law.
No one can bully us into spending
another day in this house!
Josephine, you're safe now.
You're with Mommy and Daddy.
We'll take care of you.
Mr. Hayward,
you must be some sort of magician.
Every time we make you disappear,
you keep popping back up.
- I need to talk to Josephine.
- Well, who doesn't these days?
She'll be on a plane to Lausanne tonight.
Nanny's been poisoned. Just like Grandfather.
- Isn't it exciting?
- Good God.
Well, aren't you the least bit upset?
I thought you liked Nanny.
Not particularly.
She was always scolding me
about something or other. She fussed.
And I'm sure she stole my notebook.
Josephine, is there anyone
you're remotely fond of?
- I love Aunt Edith very much.
- Well, what about us?
Josephine.
Excuse me. Won't take a moment.
Well, what about us?
Really.
- You're hurting me!
- Now, Josephine, you and I...
...we are both solving this case. Aren't we?
- I haven't got my notebook.
- Don't worry.
- What exactly do you know?
- I know lots of things.
Of that I have no doubt.
But you know who put something
in your hot chocolate, don't you?
And you know who poisoned your grandfather.
And you know who cut the ropes
from your tree house.
Right. Well, now is the time for Holmes
to enlighten not only Watson...
- ...but Lestrade.
- I shan't tell the police anything.
They're stupid. They thought
Brenda had done it or Laurence.
I wasn't stupid like that.
I knew jolly well they hadn't done it.
I had an idea who it was all along,
and then I made a kind of test.
- Now I know I'm right.
- You listen to me.
I daresay you are extremely clever.
It won't be much good to you if you're
not alive long enough to enjoy the fact.
Don't you understand, you foolish child,
that so long as you insist...
...on keeping secrets,
you put yourself in imminent danger?
Of course I do. But in some books,
person after person is killed.
You end by spotting the murderer
because he or she...
...is practically the only person left.
We must see what happens next.
This isn't a detective story, for chrissake!
Two people have been murdered.
I'll make you tell me what you know...
...if I have to shake you
until your teeth rattle!
- There you are, Charles.
- Lady Edith.
We were just having a little chat.
Of course.
And everybody is a bit tense today...
...which is quite understandable
under the circumstances.
Charles...
...Chief Inspector Taverner
and the coroner are looking for you.
I understand
they're making significant progress.
Right, well...
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her.
- Lady...
- I know, Charles.
Let me handle this.
Yes, of course.
Now...
...what do you think
about going into Longbridge...
...and having an ice cream soda?
Yes.
I understand you're making progress?
We'll have to wait for the analysis report.
You do have a theory, though?
Well...
...considering the symptoms,
and the fact that it needs to be...
...a rather common and accessible poison...
...my educated guess would be cyanide.
Why would anyone have cyanide in their house?
- Apart from killing people, you mean?
- Yeah.
Moles.
- Moles?
- Cyanide is used to kill moles.
Sorry, Lady Edith,
no one is permitted to leave the estate.
I know.
But Chief Inspector Taverner has decided...
...it would be more appropriate
if she were out of the house...
...for the next hour or so.
Until the corpse has been removed.
I mean, he doesn't believe
that a 12-year-old little girl...
...or a feeble old woman on her last legs
could be the murderers.
Do you agree, sergeant?
Sorry. We've all been a bit on edge.
- I'll get them out the way.
- Of course.
All right, boys. Move them out the way.
- Charles?
- Look.
- What are you doing?
- It's Josephine's diary.
Edith is trying to destroy it
by burying it in quicklime.
And there's cyanide up there.
What? What is it? What?
Aunt Edith's just left Three Gables.
She took Josephine.
- That's Aunt Edith's handwriting.
- Get in the car.
It's so annoying.
I can't find my notebook anywhere.
You haven't seen it, have you?
Oh, my darling.
I love you more than you'll ever know.
- Has Lady Edith left the estate?
- She left with the little girl.
- Where?
- That way. Why?
- Get those damn people out of the way!
- Get out the way!
Move! Get back! Now.
What does it say?
"I, Edith Jane de Haviland,
confess to the murder...
...of Aristide Leonides."
God, Josephine.
Josephine...
...I have a confession.
What is it?
We are not going for ice cream.
Would you like to know where we're going?
Well, yes.
I am taking you to your new ballet lessons.
Ballet lessons?
Oh, Aunt Edith.
But I haven't got my ballet slippers.
Why didn't you say?
I think they'll have everything we could
possibly want once we get there.
I wish Grandpapa could see this.
Why would Aunt Edith want
to kill Grandpapa and Nanny?
She's not a psychopath.
- I don't think it was Edith.
- Not Edith?
Maybe there's something
in Josephine's notebook.
Read it out loud.
"I'm so bored.
Something needs to happen in this house.
So today I..."
Oh, my God.
Go on.
"So today I...
- I killed Grandpapa."
- Grandpapa.
And I enjoyed it very much.
I certainly had a good reason
to do it though.
And I warned him.
I told him he'd be sorry
for stopping my ballet.
And now I hope he jolly well is.
He really shouldn't have done that.
That and other things. Many other things.
He's mean. Cruel.
He's a bad person.
And he thinks he can do anything.
He thinks he can tell everyone what to do...
...and make them crazy and miserable.
But not me. I'm stronger.
I'm different. I'm like him.
And I gave him a special treat
for his birthday.
I did my best dance for him.
I know how much he likes
watching Brenda dance.
I can see it from my tree house.
I also know how much he loved it
when Sophia wanted to be a ballerina.
He thought she was beautiful and gracious.
He said there was no point
in me having more ballet lessons...
...because I would never be good
or gracious enough.
He said it wasn't so much
Swan Lake as Duck Pond.
I hate him.
- I hate him.
- There's a bit about Brenda's letter.
"I finally got the hang of her handwriting."
It's lucky she writes like a child of 10.
I copied it from a bit in Exposure.
- Is this the right way?
- I believe so.
Today, I have to be very brave.
I put Aunt Edith's secateurs
in Laurence's drawer in the school room.
Now I must climb up
to the tree house with a knife.
But every task worth doing has a hard bit.
"Nanny's guessed.
Eustace kept asking questions,
and I worried he might."
But he didn't. Nanny did.
She's snooping around all the time.
She saw my ballet shoes, which were muddy...
...after I took secateurs from the shed.
She kept looking at me...
...and I knew she'd put
two and two together. I hate Nanny.
Always after me, trying to teach me lessons.
And she's so stupid.
I hate stupid people.
"They're useless, apart from dying
during wars like Grandpapa used to say.
She should be next."
Edith must have sensed something...
...and then she found Josephine's notebook.
And then Josephine killed Nanny.
And that's when Edith decided
to blame herself.
She couldn't let Laurence and Brenda
hang for a crime they hadn't committed.
But at the same time
she couldn't let Josephine...
...face a lifetime of institutions,
being jeered at as a monster...
...laughed at as a freak,
not to mention the public humiliation...
- ...the house would have had to endure.
- What is she doing with Josephine?
There they are.
Why this way?
It's a shortcut.
It's the road that leads to the quarry.
I don't understand.
Aunt Edith, what is this?
- You're frightening me.
- Don't be frightened.
Aunt Edith, what are you doing?
Aunt Edith!
Oh, my God, Charles. They're...
Aunt Edith, stop! Stop!
- No, no!
- Stop!
Stop the car, stop the car, stop the car.
- No, no, no.
- No.
No, no, no.
What did we do to her?
- What did we do to her?!
- No, no, it's okay.
It wasn't you. It wasn't you.
It wasn't you.
