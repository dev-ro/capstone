Master Rupesh Peethambaran, Sunny
MARYDASAN
-The Aaduthoma
-Shut your mouth
You son of a gun. Will you hit me
with hired goons from Kochi?
-Allah!
- Finish that pig
Scoundrel, l will smash your tutorial
PRATHlBA TUTORlAL COLLEGE
Kurup brother, give me a dhoti
Koya and his cronies needed this
-Did Aaduthoma come here?
-Yes
-Where is he?
-He has gone
Where has he gone?
lf you want to know exactly
You must ask him only
What is the problem?
Prathiba Tutorial was
functioning in Koya's place
Koya's daughter went
there for studies
There she fell in love with the teacher
Will koya allow this?
He closed the tutorial
The teacher went there
inquiring about it
Koya's cronies attacked him
Thoma forcibly got the key back
and handed over to teacher
Since then this problem has started
That is an old story
what is today's problem?
l will tell you about today's problem
Since Koya's cronies
could not match Thoma
He brought our community
people from Kochi to tackle him
They sprayed chilli powder
in his eyes and bashed him a lot
Will Thoma remain silent?
He stormed in like an army battered them
lt was a good bashing
lt is his good fortune the
new Sl Kuttikadan is taking charge tomorrow
Else he would have been battered
Just 2 measures of male goat's blood is enough
For Thoma to even battle with an elephant
ls my blood sweet?
lt has the taste of sugar candy
Your invention is interesting
We will go to a doctor tomorrow itself
Let us check whether l am diabetic?
Sugar can be seen only in human blood
Sugar can't be seen in sheep's blood
ls it?
Great discovery
ERUMELl SOUNDS
What dear?
Why are you weeping?
Dad slapped me
Did Thomachan come?
Where were you Basheer Master?
Don't you know about
the complaints on Thomachan?
Yesterday l came very late
l had been to Malapuram with mother
The moment you came to know
Even if it is odd hours,
shouldn't you meet him?
Had you met him
he would have been happy
Go and meet him
He would be at the junction
What Basheer?
l am no one to you
But you still risked your life for my sake
l would not disturb you like this any more
l wanted to restart tutorial
because l wanted to continue my studies
Once my Phd results are known
l would run the tutorials
Then who would teach your Muslim girl?
This lock was bought by me
Don't show your rich man's
haughtiness to this poor man
His tutorial is on your first floor
lt was not rented out for any shop
it was given for tutorial college
He is paying the rent without default
You should not close it any more
Take it
You hand over the lock to the teacher
lf you use another lock over this
l will lock you up, forever
Mumtaz, keep one key with you
Ensure that it doesn't rust,
oil it and take care
You have this gold sovereign
-What for?
-For hitting Koya
So if l hit Koya, you would give me gold
ls that so?
ls it confirmed?
Don't blow
lf you blow the fire particles would fly
This is the guy whom l was referring to you
What?
Tell me
lt is not blah blah . . ..
lf you continue to do this
l would break your head
Even a donkey can learn
maths from this Chacko master
After paying tuition fees
you are all sent here, to study
Have you understood?
lf you don't study at the right time..
You would run the
risk of begging in the street
You can ask and learn about
the plight of those wayward people
Tiger
Tiger
Beloved mother,
why is your face swollen?
-Don't try to pacify me
-Ok, l have no fears
Do you know what is happening here?
How will you know?
You are never at home
Groom's party are coming
to see your sister on Sunday
lf they ask about the elder brother..
Atleast you should be here
for us to show you
-Your favorite duck egg roast
-What is the boy's name? -Jerry
-What is he doing?
-Working in some English company of Gulf
-He is a chemical engineer
-That's good
l could only become
an 'lnji neer ' (Ginger water)
You have got an engineer son-in-law
Duck egg is a panacea for
sprains, bruise, Tuberculosis and Cough
Boil duck egg in cow's urine..
..is to be prepared
according to the formula..
..and after adding
'Nayin korana Sindhuram' (native medicine)
Should be consumed after night supper
and sleep with snores
The only panacea for piles is duck egg
After adding juice of
'Mukkutti samoolam'..
..with duck egg,
omelet should be prepared
This is the ideal cure for piles
Beloved mother,
give me 2 bangles of yours
-What for?
-To pledge, some repairs in the lorry
Repairs in lorry?
ls it engine repair?
Yes engine repair in lorry
What do you do with
the money you earn through lorry?
That is all sufficient only
for the engine repair
Then can't you fix a new engine?
Ask him to discard that
old rusty engine and get a new one
Also you get him the new engine
Then take this and set right the engine
-l have only 2 more
-l will get everything back
l am giving up
Come, my pal
Move aside
Our new Sl Kuttikadan sir
wants to see you
What is the matter?
He wants to meet personally the
guy who drinks the male goat's blood
ls it for giving his
sister to me in marriage?
Don't laugh
What did you say?
Do you want boss's sister as your wife?
He is calling you to fix that proposal
Then tell your boss, my marriage
has already been finalised
You can come and tell him
-Mania, go
-l will go only with you
-lt would be difficult -The police team
is strong enough to do that
Get lost
-Leave him
-What did you say? -Leave him
You could have just said
what was told to you
Take him away
or he will get what is in store
Go away
l would make you
count the steps with your nose
-Come on
-Wait
Come on tell me
l don't know
He didn't come sir
when we called him
He asked, whether
you would give your sister?
Not like that sir
He told him you wanted to see the..
..male goat's blood sucking local rowdy
Even if l said that
How can he ask that way?
He didn't say that way?
He asked whether you would..
..agree to give your sister in marriage?
lt is all the same
lt is not so
He is justifying it
because he was his son's classmate
We should pluck out
his tongue for saying that
-Where is the Aaduthoma?
-He is not here
Get up. Are you running
a sound service or a club?
-lt is a sound service sir
-Damn your sound service
-Who is he?
-Thomas brother, he is my God sir
-ls he your God?
-Yes he is my God
-What did you say?
-Don't hit me unnecessarily
There was no one here
to donate blood to my daughter
Thomas brother alone gave blood
Don't ask me the meaning of obligation
That girl is his sister
Shall we call the snake that has bitten
and bring down the toxin?
Wait, where are you going?
-Don't resist
What is your name? -Leave me
l didn't do anything
why are you crying?
Don't do it sir. Her father is a
well known teacher of the town
You go away
Come on
l want to see your beloved brother
Come, get in
Dad
What mistake did my daughter do?
Don't you know what people would say
if you detain an adult girl here?
Now l know that the beggar who couldn't
identify mother and sister, has a father
lnjimukku Police Station
When he was called to the station
He asked whether Sl
would give his sister to him
l just wanted to know
whether he has a sister
Go away
l am Thoma, Aaduthoma
-Why did you call me?
-To give my sister
-What is this sir?
-Are you showing your temerity?
Scoundrel, your glasses!
Who are you?
Are you playing with police?
-Don't do it sir, leave him
-Go away
l will show you who l am
l will. . ..
l will. . ..
You blackguard
Will you attack with your clothes?
Aaduthoma (Aadu thoma)
Come on dance (Aadra)
Don't do anything
lf you have any affection for me
Don't do anything
Are you staring at me?
Do you want my sister?
Come
l will. . ..
Don't think l will submit before you
Get inside
Don't give him even water
Let him lie there
Don't try to scare me by staring at me
l will ..
Sir, l have a request to make
Because of him
police has touched my daughter
Betrayer, don't let him out
Let me get my daughter married
-Come, let us go
-Brother -l asked you to come
-Don't worry, you go home
-Somehow get him released
Greetings!
My God! Look at the clout of Koya
My boy has been imprisoned
-He is our lawyer
-l am Suriyanarayanan
He is a brahmin
l am the boy's paternal uncle Vackachan
Give the bail application
Shall l leave sir?
l have heard that you have
dumped Sl Somasekar in a well
Now you would have understood about me
Use this as a walking stick
when you become old
Get lost
Dress up, before you leave
Come on lawyer
Turn the vehicle
Lawyer, the ancestral
'Melaparambil' property and its benefits..
..my fixed deposits in
Canara Bank and all the..
..remaining movable and
immovable properties..
..after Mary's life must be
bequeathed to my only daughter
Jhansi Chacko, make a will to this effect
Thomachan is also our son
He should not be completely
ignored in the settlement
l will ignore him
A girl of marriageable age
being taken in police jeep..
..was witnessed by,
the entire people of the town
Who was responsible for that?
Your worthless boy
He has become my perennial headache
-That devil -But he too has a
rightful share in the property
He does not have any claim to
even a particle of my lands
But my entire share is his
You may give,
after all you are his paternal uncle
Your lenience only have
spoiled him like this
lf you have any affection towards him..
..don't give the last of
gold ornaments your dad gave you
Let it remain with the mother
for the coffin expenses of the son
-Damn it
-What damn it?
After battering and killing the son
You want his mother to
buy the coffin for him
What an useless dad are you?
Tiger
Smart one, though it is a bird
lt is sensible
The solitary herbal panacea
Gulp it
Sheep milk and chilli juice
lf it had been somebody else's intestine
it would have been charred
-lyappa
-What?
Oh God, it is Thomachan
When do you start the matinee show?
Kuttikadan sir and his wife asked us to
start and we have started the show
So if he asks you to start, will you start?
-Now if you ask me to stop, l will stop it
-Then start afresh
When you say l will do it
Come fast
Come, let us go
Does it itch you?
What you have done to my sister..
l wouldn't repeat to her
l am not that bad
l want to see you alone
-We can meet
-l would be available here
Will you catch hold of my sister's hand?
No
When you become old,
use this as walking stick
This is my new Rayban glass
lf you walk over it
l will chop off your leg
How much did you give him?
l have kicked him
His inner tongue would have moved inwards
That is not sufficient
He has caught Jhansi by her hand
You should have cut off his arms
Boss, it was like a thunder
Greatest of all thunders
Struck on his back
You should have seen it
l have never seen such a bash in my life
A bash that would send one to heaven
You should have seen it
To withstand these hits
one sheep blood won't do
That is the power of
the gold sovereign given by me
-lf they play with Kutti, it would be so
-l was not referring to that
Thomachan removed the clothes
and has bashed him
Hit him on his neck
and pushed him into the jeep
You are fed by me
Have you gone to see his strip tease?
Give it to him
Let him see it properly
This she got us a gift from university
For securing first rank in B.Sc. Mathematics
l was her maths book
She had enough of my chalk piece throws
l have heard that if you teach
even donkey's would learn maths
Each revolution of the
earth is mathematical
Without mathematics
earth is a big circular zero
Tiger
l have won the model teacher award
from the lndian President
See there
He is my brother, Vakkachan
He is Joseph of water works
Sister in law, please come
Brother, come for a minute
lf it is something related to him
l don't want to hear, don't tell me
You must hear it
Otherwise, this function may not go well
Thomachan has assaulted
the Sl at the theatre
Police is on a hunt
any time they might come here
Dispose them off as early as possible
Oh! God, what a kind of a fellow is he?
The whole incident is like a vicious circle
lf he is caught
Kutikadan will not spare him
Talk to the chief secretary
after all he is your student
Amidst all this,
do l have to save him?
That scoundrel made
police take my daughter to station
-l would not talk for him to anyone
-Please make a call
l would not fall at
anybody's feet for his sake
Then l may have to do that
l won't allow him to be
imprisoned and bashed
-What is the matter?
-Nothing, a problem of evicting a tenant
When we went to evict him
He made certain issues
He is an old student of brother
So only brother can talk to him
So to make brother talk to him
Sl Kuttikadan might come here
ls that all?
Tiger
Do you rear tiger here?
There is one. He has jumped
the cage and his roaming around
But we will cage him one day
ls it not?
Kuttikadan has come
we will sit inside, come
Brother
You go there
Oh God!
-Where is Thoma? -He is not here
-Today he should be present here
l am telling you the truth
lnside, an important function
in my daughter's life is going on
-Don't spoil that
-That is your problem, move away
l have won the model teacher award
from President
Accept my request, as a reverence
that the student owes to the teacher
Don't ruin my daughter's life
Give me a day's time
On another occasion l will hand over
the scoundrel being searched by you
What Thomacha?
-Where is he?
-He has left last night itself
Tell me where is he?
l don't know
Are you telling lies?
Come on
You must do the fitting and cutting
This two sleeved type,
who else will do?
-lt is for my daughter's betrothal
-Will do it nicely
-What is the boy doing?
-He is an engineer in a British company
Move away from there
Come out
Come out
Let your father see this pathetic sight
You should feel ashamed and lose your skin
-ls it all required?
-Go back
Come on walk
l said walk
Walk you scoundrel
Walk fast
Move away
Don't beat him
SP asked me to inform you, he is on line
-Tell him l am not here
-l have told him you are available
Why did you take
Chacko master's daughter to station?
-Her brother is a big headache
-But why should you take his sister?
That was used as a ruse
to bring her brother to station
Shouldn't you do this
taking into account his stature?
Chief secretary is the
old student of his father
DGP has talked to me on this
Release him
The 'Ezhumala' spring..
lt is a pearl necklace to the mountain
lt is a golden evening
A time ripe for sowing
Fondle him dear
On seeing the Cupid
the black rocks would apply peacock oil
But inside it is a rosewater spring
A nectar spring
Oh mirror looking jungle flower
Don't jinx the royal chief
You are dancing and singing, fish eyed girl
Oh! you are jet black crow alike
The mango like mark on
your chest invites me
The dot mark
You look like a hot pig iron
But within you, you are a sugarcane
Fondle me dear
Thomacha stay there
-l can't father
-l asked you to stay there
-What is it Father?
-You scoundrel, rogue and useless fellow
-What am l hearing about you?
-What have you heard about me?
Pestle !You with that girl . . ..
l don't want to say anything
Have you grown so big?
Rotund guy ,do you have any sense of shame?
What is it father?
Are you mocking at me, with folded hands?
-You donkey
-No, l was sincerely pitying on you
lt was a mistake to have
walked through the streets
What is wrong in walking?
What work you have there?
l went there for a black coffee
Pestle ! d o you drink coffee in
some prostitutes house?
He likes the Arabic coffee prepared by her
Damn it
You dirty fellow
l like
ls it the perfume or me?
Both
Brother
Hope you have heard about what happened?
When he caught hold of you,
what else can l do?
Don't weep, have this
She doesn't require your chocolates
Give it back
Get lost you beggar
Beloved mother
Don't call me beloved any more
ls it right to walk with arms around
shoulders of a prostitute before dad?
When you went to sleep with her
You have forgotten about
your marriageable age sister
That has ruined her marriage that was fixed
l have justified all your acts before
But l can't bear this
Don't become a curse to me
Mother
Go away, damn with your chocolate
Get lost, don't come here
any more to get ornaments
from me and to give chocolates to your sister
lf you feel sad for me
holding her shoulders in front of dad
what will you do if l marry her?
who is it?
l am Jhansy's brother, Thoma
Aaduthoma?
l came for . . .
No,l don't want to hear why you came
We have decided not to
go ahead with that proposal
Are you not Thomachan?
l have seen you in Jhancy's album
And also l have seen
your robotics, it was beautiful
-Come
-l don't want any respects to be shown
l have not come to
find a groom for my sister
My sister doesn't require
the perfumes of the heavenly bodies
You may give it to
others where you may visit
Thoma
lt is not a place suitable for us
Go through the news paper headlines
He was handcuffed
along with a prostitute and..
..dragged through streets
We don't need his sister
The marriage is not with her brother
it is his sister only
what objections are you raising?
ls it a relation worth
considering for a good family?
l have seen only one girl
l like her
ls it not enough if l know her?
l need not know about the family members
when l gave this to Jhansi
l have given my heart too
Take this and return it to her
l thought the only live male
in this earth is me
lt is not so
What is it?
Cadbury's chocolate
lt is fine
lt was given by brother
Why dad?
Tastes very bad
lf l don't screw you
l will remove my uniform..
..and would be prepared to shave for you
Are you certain?
Then l will grow long hairs
For Sl Soman to shave it off
Are you not happy with
assaulting him and giving a stick?
He has charged that you have pushed..
..him into the well in
the market and have killed him
Murder case?
No, as an attempt to murder -Say so
Take of your hands
ls this the place to twist your mustache?
Can't l twist my mustache?
Brother
You must come for my betrothal
lt is scheduled for 3 'o' clock
-l will come
The magistrate is coming
-There is a case on me..
-Dhoti
..as having assaulted the Sl
and pushed him into a well
There is a poor girl called
Rajamma running a petty shop there
Sl outraged her modesty
She is a poor girl
On seeing that he assaulted Sl. . .
lt would be better
if it is all over before noon
At 3 'o' clock
my sister's betrothal is scheduled
l have promised l would attend the function
What is your name?
Thoma
Why did you talk to him on his way
What is wrong in it?
Magistrate is a nice person
Didn't you see him asking my name?
He would have asked your name
lt could be either to rear or butcher
Aaduthoma
Wait, wait
Call the next case
Vazhakulam Paramar 's case
Defendant chameleon Gopalan
Coffee
l don't want
Drama artist Malapuram Mallika's
chain snatched in broad daylight
by defendant Theekolli Rajappan
l am going
Having waited so long
don't make it futile
You have come so far
Let that trouble be over
Case of Sl somasekaran's assault
and push to a barren well
Defendant Aaduthoma
ls your profession sheep butchering?
No l don't butcher sheep
l drink the blood from the sheep's neck
That is the secret of my health
My 'Jeevantone'
Even a valiant man's blood
is relished by a mosquito
That means that which
promotes health, is the favorite medicine
The one who liberates from
disease is the best physician
Herbal medicines
and sheep's blood are my medicine
A jack of all trades
But commonsense is a big zero
Next hearing is on September 22nd
Come after learning commonsense
l am Aaduthoma
Yesterday because you helped me
l could attend my sister's betrothal
Please for heaven's sake, don't trouble us
l am not a thug to trouble you
You have studied law
But l would teach you the value of time
Where are you going?
To Cheppad family
Venmani Vishnu's Geeta recital starts today
Hope no one there require tablets for gas trouble
Then you need not go
Where were you when
sister's betrothal took place?
l had been to America
-Brother
-What?
You didn't come for my betrothal
The case was not over
Eat this, l kept this aside
specially for you
Move away
Oh God!
Will you touch my mother . . .?
Brother
Leave him
Leave me
Leave him
Oh God !
Don't hit him
Don't hit him
Go away
Come on
Don't do it sir
Walk
Have you started to show
your pranks to the magistrate?
You scoundrel
He has made my house a police station
My words would come true
Take him away
ls it required sir?
Go away
Don't take away my son
My son Thomacha
Don't take away my son
Brother
This one has sent my only son away
this is no more required in this house
Don't water roots that are dead
You only destroyed his roots
when he was young
You did beat him and squeeze
as if he was a wet towel
l did that to make him
a mathematician of repute
Are you not today seeing him
as a notorious rowdy?
Lock him up in the gate
Walk fast
Open the gate
will you not open it?
Don't do anything
-Open
-They are beating him
Stop it sir
people are watching
Go away from here
Stop it, what are you doing?
He is not opening it
Why can't you open it?
Don't resort to 3rd degree methods
in this premises
lf he succumbs to your hits
who will answer for that?
ls not what he did an atrocity?
Courts and cases are meant only for that
lf you have any earlier animosity
don't hit him after locking him up
Release and hit him
all of you don't deserve caps
Remove his handcuffs
l said remove it
Release him
We would like to have complaint lodged
l think now l have to
make a complaint on you
You have already assaulted him
Now why do you want a complaint?
Before it is late, try to reach home
l have seen your younger days
l can not bear this sight
Are you the same Thomas Chacko
who did wonders while in school?
Dad
Get up
Have you understood the problems of
your interest in mechanisms?
Keep quiet
Look at the police man's son
and learn from him
Go away
Song coming from this !
From where you got this?
Was it made by you?
Oh God!
From where did you get this?
l did this,soap box radio
Let me see it
Don't put it in the stove
Don't damage it
My radio
What is it you have done?
Don't kill children's enthusiasm like this
First studies, then only discoveries
Useless discoveries
Do you want to know his marks in math's?
Tell him
Just passed
-Just passed -ls it not enough?
-That is not sufficient
Do you want to know
the mark of a cop's son?
-Hundred out of hundred
-Pestle
Because he didn't secure
100 marks in maths..
..the heavens are not going to fall down
Every revolution of earth
is based on mathematics
Without mathematics,
earth is just a big zero
What is it that is moving around?
lron particles
What is its use?
This is used to make steel
Can you think about a world without iron?
The entire world
revolves around iron, is it not?
No, the world revolves around math's
Tiger
TlGER
-Who has written this?
-Not me
-Then who did this?
-l don't know
You will tell. Else my horse shoe
will make you to come out
l did that sir
Was it done by you?
Smart boy
-Come
-Come on your knees
Tell me the general form
of the quadratic equation
Tell me
lmpertinent fellow
He has come to study!
What is the general form
of the quadratic equation?
You are blinking
Now listen to him, Balu
Get up, stand there
Hold this
Go and clean the place
where Balu is sitting
That is the ideal job for you
Go quickly
Dad
Teachers should not come to
class at his convenience
-Normally l don't come late
-so what?
Come here
You have made the
instrument box as your tool box
The punishment for that is,
From today you have to ring the bell
Stay on the salt pstone and do it
How far is your work on the bell?
l need some money
Take it from my table drawer
Wonder bell, Wonder bell
Keep quiet
Don't shout
lt is an invention
Being a book worm is of no use
Go to the classes
Tiger's hand
Come here
By making this bell
are you mocking at the headmaster?
Not for mocking
l did this for the school
Hold this
Have you made it for the school?
His wonder bell
Go to the class
All of you go
l asked all of you to go
what have you done sir?
lf he makes bells like this
He won't become an engineer
He would only become an
'lngi neer'(ginger water)
Look at his protractor and scale
This shows his apttitude
We must encourage him
l don't want him to be a mechanic
He should become a
reputed mathematician like me
ls this the study table of
an 8th standard student?
How many children were tutored by us?
What is the use in getting a just pass
He must fail in the examination
then only he will start learning
You need not get concerned
His dad is telling you
The previous generation
has wielded the great masts
Why did you mark it in red?
You only taught me
about consonants in grammar
Didn't you teach me like that?
Then why did you mark it in red?
You have joined Chacko master
to fail me deliberately
To make me an useless fellow
Thomas Chacko
Hereafter l won't study in your class
What is this Thomas chacko?
Don't call me
Red means blood also
Balu
What is it Thomas chacko?
Show me your hand
What is it?
Chacko master is not my dad
he is your dad
TlGER
Son, my beloved son
l had to see my son
cutting off the sleeves of dad
That was awkward like
a sixth finger in hand
My son has cut off my sleeves
You made him do that
Even when he returned
after 1 4 years of begging
You didn't even looked at his face
How will l welcome a fellow
who has come with a valueless coin?
But you only made him like that
Climb the stairs and have a look
You were praising Balu's smartness
But couldn't see your son's capabilities
Then what did happen?
All the time talking about Balu
You have jinxed him also
You have made the gold a charred charcoal
His mind would never become gold
Let the world see Chacko master,
like this hereafter
Today he has cut the sleeves
Tomorrow he would cut the neck
No, tomorrow, he would weep
For having cut the sleeves of his dad
for his entire life
Boss l have come to see you
What?
you have laid your hands on my mother
You locked me on the gate and hit me
Only my corpse can forgive you for this
But l am postponing your case
Let my sister's marriage be over
See you, come
Don't wag because your dad
taught the Chief Secretary
and your paternal uncle has lots of money
You are playing with the police
To roll your head in the streets
my hands are not required
There are better rowdies
than you in the lock up
Sister, take him inside
and give him some food, go
Why are you planting a
coconut tree in the front yard?
Are you not happy now?
After piercing the fingers of his friend
Your son has gone absconding
You are responsible for all that
l have no regrets for that
You have hit and driven away a guy
who would have been a potential great
You will weep for him at least once
With the same kerchief
with which you made him..
..wipe the bench,
you will wipe your tears
When he is hungry for two days
He will come on his own
Don't bother
l am bothered
Your convinced me on the foolish
philosophy of deliberately failing him
Why did you made me do that?
When he burnt the answer papers
and thrown it on my face
l felt the heat of it
As long as Tiger Chacko is
the headmaster of this school
l would not step in
You have come back
lt was not desire
Then l decided, once l should come
My daughter, Thulasi
CP as the one who initiated her studies
Then she must be an idealist
Have you recognised her?
She is my daughter Jhansi
She secured state first rank
and gold medal in B.Sc.
You would have read that in newspapers
Her marriage is finalised
My son in law is an engineer
What about your son?
He has returned, after 1 4 years
But it is of no use
He is a big zero
When you have hit him
what did you expect him to become?
There are people who have
come up nicely also
There are people who don't die
even after an elephant has stamped them
There might be
what happened to your shirt sleeves?
-lt was cut
-Who did it? -Son
lt is alright
As far as l am concerned
that devil is no more
ln lieu of that l have
planted a coconut tree
This one, this tree won't betray me
This is an immortal tree
l would water it forever
l would start my day seeing it daily
Don't fly away in
the fury of the eastern wind
My land has good creepers
l would hold on to it
Look there
See the name of Thoma's lorry
Thoma, what is this?
Sir CP is new invention
Devil
Yes l wrote it 1000 times
in mind and decided
Only after that
l have painted it as 'devil'
A devil who has cut dad's sleeves
A cheap thug -Aaduthoma
Other than this what is your qualification?
You play cards on some terrace
and walk with arms around some prostitutes
Where will you have dignity?
l have kept your value safely
This least old coin
Keep it with you
ln place of you, now l have a son
Look at that coconut sapling
Till l breath last, l would water it
Only after drinking a tender coconut
from that tree l would die
-Dad, don't talk like that to brother
-Ask him to go away
He has walked over my dreams, a devil
Get lost, henceforth,
you shouldn't enter this house
l will come again, to the cemetery
to drop handful of soil in your grave
-Let that soil from your son
be from beneath this sapling -Son..
Take it as my gratitude
for the food l had here
Who is it?
l will . . .
-Get down. l asked you
to get down -Look there
Forgive me
l just wanted to scare you
Who are you?
Have you forgotten me?
The old Thulasi who gave water
to the weeping friend
Oh God!
-Where were you all these days?
-Ottapalam
-l came to meet my classmate
-You shouldn't have come
-Thomas Chacko
-No, Aaduthoma
Stop the vehicle
You know my name
Thoma
Your disciple
The coconut sapling
and an old valueless coin
l am leaving this
in your divine collection box
Weep
Your other disciples are also inside this
They are all angry with you
What wrong did we do?
You have not done any wrong
But the scoundrels here have crucified you
-Do you remember me?
-l will never forget you
-l wanted to see you
-lf l don't want to see you?
Come, what are you blinking at?
Remove this, remove, break it
Smash and throw it away
ls this the place to plant a sapling?
On the chest of his mother in law
Clod
Throw it in the river
For planting a sapling
in front yard in place of your son
Goosberry cream should
be applied on your head
You can only uproot it from the front yard
But you cannot uproot it from my heart
That devil will weep and his tears
would become the salt for this earth
Clod
Gold and silver must be
kept under lock and key
But words must be weighed and uttered
Brother
Keep the flame hot
To burn your palm
Get down
Are you not ashamed to run with this name?
Who are you to change
the name given by my dad?
Teacher, from today,
in the school where we studied..
-Thought l will make a beginning here
-That is not required
Once your father has taught me
That l have not forgotten
Unless you change the name
l will not allow you to move forward
Go, now
Run over my leg
l have plan to trap you
what?
stay there
-Where are you going?
-Are you the devil's driver?
ls Aaduthoma inside?
Aaduthoma?
Did you baptize him?
Don't get furious Ahmed, greetings to you
Haven't you recogonised me?
No, Vagamon Mary?
Kuttikanam kochu ammani?
Mundakayam Vatsala
Seems there are lot of women
l am Thulasi
Tholasi?
Not Tholasi, Thulasi
Sir ,Thulasi is coming
From where did this come?
Have you repaid the loan
bought for lorry from Uppukandam?
l didn't tell her anything
But that has to be repaid
who are you?
are you his wife?
Not that
lf they take away the lorry tomorrow
Will it not be a weakness on our part?
-Get lost
What a dirty playing card is this?
Can't you buy some decent playing cards?
What is this?
What a bitter taste?
Drinking this ,people will surely die
People say your liver is good
Why should you
drink this toddy and spoil it?
-Where had you been?
-To temple
-l will drop you
-Not required
Come, get in
Come
Do you move around with toddy?
l got this for you
Oh God, l don't want toddy
How can you say like that?
The grape toddy is bitt er, isn't it?
You should also taste that
How do you feel?
ln the front yard of
the Parumala street house
Planted a cocunut tree sapling
Water in the pot and
the chief is in lust
Scooped and watered it
Scooped little and watered it
For coconut tree, the bunch of
flowers is its tender leaves
Water filled tender coconuts
On the sweet mango tree
is a honey sparrow
lt has seen the
greener pastures of the other side
lt has seen
The tender mud pot of the liver
has little honey like sweet toddy
Don't do it
Scooping a droplet
the little sparrow girl
That sparrow girl is
dancing and singing in stupor
ln stupor
-What happened?
-l gave her a bottle of toddy
Tell her not to interfere in
my personal bliss, for father too
Thomas chacko
No Aaduthoma
When you said
that day the red that l marked..
..also means blood
l understood it
l never stepped into
the school after you left it
l have thrown my resignation
on your dad's face and stepped out
Thomacha
-why did you come?
To see you
-you have seen me, you may go
l bought this for you
you must attend
Jhansi's marriage wearing this
Keep it safely it can be used
to cover the corpse of Chacko master
You told me l should not
call you beloved and drove me out
Still l will address you only so
Beloved mother
Considering me as dead, while l am alive. . .
..he has planted a sapling in the front yard
Don't call me to that house
l will not come
-l cannot think of a marriage without you
l am not required dear
My thoughts would be with you
Go
Wear this and attend sister's marriage
-Don't expect me there
-Pestle
Who else will celebrate
your sister's marriage, other than you?
lf he wished for that he would
not have planted a coconut sapling
What coconut tree ,l have
removed and thrown it in the river
Don't tell me the tattoo
on hand can be washed away
l am reminded of that boy
who responded to my claps
l want that obedience from you
Because of you ,let her not
wet her bedspread with tears
l can hear the turmoil in your mind
The rough tidal waves
must also become calm
To serve her sweets
in the dining hall you must be there
l will come, but chacko master
should invite me looking at my face
He need not address me
as son, just 2 words
'You must come'
-lf he doesn't say that, is he your dad?
There is no question of me
inviting me looking at his face
Just 2 words 'You must come'
He will come only
if you invite looking at his face
He need not come like that
He can come to put soil in my grave
Cutting off sleeves of my shirt
is equivalent to cutting my hands
You will not understand
the feelings of a father..
.. because you are not
a father and you have no family
why should we have a family like this?
Jhansi's marriage must be celebrated nicely
You always feel proud of your daughter
When she leaves the house after marriage
People should not question about
the whereabouts of the living brother
They must question, the answer to that
is this shirt cut by my son
Pestle,This is why l said we should
apply gooseberry paste on your head
You should not spit lying flat on floor
When her own sibling is kept aside..
..that will make her to
submit herself in her in law's place
Call him dad, you are my dear dad
You have brought me up to this stage
Do you want to see me leaving with sobs?
Forget everything and call him
l will call him,
for the sake of my daughter
But one thing, l won't come
to the market or his place
You need not go there
Can you come to
the church in the afternoon?
Have this son
Have some sweets
Then. . .
Coming 1 4th Monday in the Parae church
My daughter Jhansi's marriage
will be solemnised
After the marriage, dinner is in my house
lf you have time and
convenience, we can meet there
Pestle, he is not your father
Then how do you want to
invite a guy who has cut my sleeves?
l know only this
He need not come for my daughter's marriage
My student chief secretary would come
That is enough
He would not attend
your daughter's marriage
My son is not a beggar
Why are you are staring like this?
Go away
Stay there
Celebrate you daughter's marriage alone
Atleast today, can't you change this shirt?
-lf visitors see this ..
-All visitors must see this
And they should ask me
That will answer them why son is
not present for my daughter's marriage
Dear, wear all this
and get dressed up beautifully
-Where is your Raman unni?
-He will not come
-ls it master?
-Yes
l am chief secretary's PA
He wants to talk to you
Give it to him
-ls it Master?
-Yes, have you not started yet?
Forgive me sir. l have to
accompany the CM to Delhi urgently
On my return l will meet
the bride and the groom
Then . . .hello
This is your brother's gift
He gave it to me
for handing over to you
Amidst the 51 soverigns of master
let not this necklace of
your brother go unnoticed
He asked me to convey this to you
-Where are the ornaments?
-lt is kept beneath near your feet
Why is it?
l don't want the dowry given by you
l need this necklace only given by brother
-You cannot decide on that
-l am an adult
l can decide
But then, l never knew
you have grown up to this level
Seems your brother's chocolate
was sweeter, than your dad's life
You can step out now
You don't require my guidance any more
-Don't decide like that
-This is a wedding house
People outside should not know
what has happened inside
Quickly ask for his pardon
wear the jewels and then step out
-No-
l will . . ..
Kill me, then l will step out
Where is my brother?
Didn't you go for
Chacko master's house marriage?
l am sad about what happened to you
But l am not sad
There is only one sorrow in my mind
l pierced that poor Balu's hands
with the compass then
l shouldn't have done that?
What wrong did he do?
lf l had to meet him someday
l was safely keeping a kiss for his palm
But that didn't happen
Why did you get him a bike?
For an engineer son, other than the dad
who will buy a bike?
But his untimely demise was
due to the jinxed eye of that tiger
That tiger will rest
only after killing everyone
Who is it?
ls it Jhansi?
-Jhansi and her husband have come
-Where?
After the marriage
we have come here straight
This is enough for the worthless old coin
-What do you want?
-l don't want anything now
No, l should give you..
No, have this silk
Mother gave me this for her marriage
-You wear this, wear it let me see
-What is wrong in it?
Only we are here
You remove this
When you can see it
then what is it for me?
Don't laugh
lt is fine, your hubby
looks nice in this, isn't it?
You go in this dress for
the sweet serving ceremony
-Tell me, what else you want?
-l have a small desire, shall l say that?
-Tell me -l want to see your strikes
after removing the dhoti
Next time when l do that
invite my brother in law too
Didn't your dad
give you any gold ornaments?
l need only this necklace sent by you
-Necklace sent by me?
Through whom?-Through Thulasi
What are you saying?
Did she say, it was given by me?
Yes, she said you have told her to convey..
..amidst dad's 51 sovereigns this necklace
of yours should not be lost sight of
ln this year's science exhibition
Suresh must get first prize
Your robot needs an head too
You have melted a rock that
would not splinter by fireworks
You have shown to tiger Chacko
this worthless old coin has value
What do you want in return?
The dark glasses that you are wearing
What she asked was not your sunglasses
but she meant your heart
Memories..
Memories played the flute
lt is time
ls it Yamuna?
Has it flown back?
The sweet ringing of bell is inviting me
Along with the 51 sovereigns
thrown by daughter..
Keep the keys of this house also
l am going to my house
l was waiting for my daughter to go out
Before leaving l am washing the dirt
of 33 years of my stay in this hell
Hereafter l will not step into this house
Didn't you once ask me to keep safely
these bangles to buy coffin for my son?
Like the son, the mother also may not be
able to get away from that
This is the last sovereign left
in the dowry you got
Keep it safely
You can buy the coffin for me
The rotation of the earth
is in mathematics, isn't it?
The daughter whom you brought up
so dearly and your wife
Where are they now?
l am going to see you getting rusty
sitting alone in this big house
The mind of a teacher should be humane
You have not loved anyone till today
Can you tell me honestly
that you loved your daughter so dearly?
You cannot
To put down the son, you acted as if..
..you loved your daughter very much, that's all
lf you had loved her, she would not have
left this place like an orphan corpse
You would have been at the wedding place
Life is not your mathematics
Now you will understand that
Tiger
Tiger
Father
Are you in toilet?
Doesn't bathe and. . .
Who is it?
Looks nice, father Thoma
You dirty fellow,
are you using my robes?
-Remove it
-Let me wear it for a while father
Before death . . .
if l am fortunate to become a ..
-Are you drunk?
-No
This stench comes from your robes
Must wash this at least occasionally
-Tell me the truth?
Are you drunk? -Yes l have
-lt is grapes toddy
-Pestle, are you coming drunk before me?
-Get out of this place
-l drank out of happiness
What is there to be happy?
Tiger Chacko has learnt
this worthless old coin has some value
He had to sit at home
hugging the 51 sovereign box
The pestle made out of Jack tree
Now l have understood
Father do you pound rice using this?
Some people have planned to
steal the gold cross of our church
This pestle is for hitting those
who come to steal it
When l am with you
Why do you need this father?
Throw it away
You have come drunk
in the midnight to disturb people
Father, be careful
Some times snakes might bite you
-l praise the Lord
-Now and always praise the Lord
Where is the chief priest?
He has gone to search the pestle
Oh God!
Who is it? Chacko?
Look there
The robe suits him very much
Are you going?
l will come later
Koya, your would be son in law
has got his Ph.D.
Go inside
You dirty beggar
go away with your Ph.D.
Mumtaz, take that
Should not touch that
lf you love him, take that
Don't do it boss
She is your beloved daughter
lf you start loving,
you might get these hits
-Then only love will have
a sort of . . .this thing -l will kill you
After all your dad is beating you
endure that
Come up
-What is it?
-You must save me
They are coming to kill me
No one will kill you
l have lost my Mumtaz
Today afternoon is her wedding
She has sent this letter
asking me to save her
-What Kuttikadan sir?
-l have come to see you
Kuttikadan wants you to do a job for him
-What do you want sir?
-You must go to a marriage at Kottayam
A gold sovereign from me
Let this be with you
Boss, have you invited Thomas for the marriage?
-What are you saying?
- See who is coming there
Your mind is golden
You love your enemies too
Devil, did you inform him?
l would kill you
Oh God!
l will kill you
l only told him
l will continue to inform him
When l asked for some money
Didn't you ask me to sell my land?
l had been with you for 30 years
Do you have that gratitude?
Go away
Dear
You Pig
Before starting for the marriage your
daughter has given this letter to Basheer
Don't make me divulge this
before your new groom
To take your head off,
l have brought a guy Thorappan Bastin
-Match box -Not match box,
l will give you fire
Go somewhere and lead a life
Go
Catch hold of him
Don't take it out
Blood
l have no death
ln case l die, my copse must be
kept in your house
Someone has stabbed Thoma at Kottayam
He is in a serious condition
Come brother, let us go
-l am not coming
-Let the people at least say..
You were near him when he died
lt is enough if you go
Brother
Jesus
Brother
Don't cry, what is this?
Don't scream here
Brother
Keep quiet
Sit here
Sit down
Nothing will happen
How is he?
Jesus you have saved him
You will weep for him at least once
With the same kerchief
with which you made him..
..wipe the bench,
you will wipe your tears
-Come -What is it?
-Chacko master has come, come
There he is going
There
lf you want to see his capacity in younger days
Climb the stairs and have a look
You only made him a worthless old coin
Your dad came to see you
-Did he come with a coffin?
-Holding your legs he broke down
He would have touched
to see whether l am alive
-Don't talk like that son
-Beloved mother, you go home
l won't go when you are in this condition
You must go
l don't need anyone here
-Brother
-Take her and leave this place
-l asked you to go
-Come
Shall l tell you a
panacea to control anger?
The lady carved by the
carpenter is a fat lady (Tongue twister)
Ok, then drink this
Drink it my dear
Have it
That day l asked you for
the dark glasses because..
l wanted to see those eyes
that l adored in my younger days
l have kept those eyes
safely in my heart for a life time
Enough
What?
Medicines can heal
only the wounds of the body
But it cannot heal the
wound in heart made by the foe
-Are you here now?
-Yes
Have you come to see
whether l am dead?
You are like a cat
l know you will not die so soon
Have you come to get evidences?
Do you want to know who stabbed me?
Thorappan Bastin
That may not be correct
For last one week,
he is here in my lock up
ls the game played by you?
Kuttikadan said 'to roll my head in streets
his hands are not required'
Now l have understood
what he meant by that
l know about Sub inspectors..
..who send out thieves in custody
to rob and get a share of the booty
You have sent out Thorappan
from lock up to stab me, isn't it?
Thoma is in rage
Will you release criminals from lock up?
Don't do it
Leave him
Don't do
Get in
Don't trail me like a devil
l don't like to see you anymore
Why did you keep it safely?
ln a life filled with darkness
Why did you bring this..
..worthless coin to remind
those shattered dreams?
The origin of values begin with that coin
That is why, this bell
that was thrown aside..
..was kept safely by me
like a peacock feather
From the quirk of fate
l am going down in a quick sand now
To sink along with me
on my shoulders, l don't want you
l know you are down nose deep
But still your hands have
the strength to climb up
No, l can hear windows
being opened by people to see..
..my corpse being taken to
the grave of scoundrels
l can't betray my Thulasi who has
helped a friend like me in dire straits
These words are enough for me
you have called me as 'my Thulasi'
Wear it
Herafter you should not
remove this dhoti to fight
Please move that hand a little
What are you doing?
Tie
What is this?
He was removing the tie
-Sheep beef roasted in fire
-ls it that of a male goat?
No it is of that black male goat
Black male goat's meat
will get tomorrow after his death
Good
CRYSTAL
[SPATlKAM]
The dad who planted a coconut sapling
in place of a son has no right to live
Thomas, bomb in your lorry
jump out
This was done by Kuttikadan and Koya
l heard their man talking
privately to Kumaran
They asked him to guard your corpse
One stab like this is enough
to bring the knife out
But l am not doing it
From today l am learning to forgive
-Get up -Thomas lorry was..
-What happened?
Police are supposed to uphold law and justice
But with their help Koya has
planted a bomb in the lorry to kill my son
Koya? l charge you for
planting bomb to kill your son
lt is a lie
l know who is behind this..
..and sir also knows about it
Don't open your mouth
Don't scare me. l don't want this cap,
if it is going to fly off when sneezed
-l will . . .
-l will tell the truth anywhere
Bomb was planted in
the lorry by you and Koya
You go away
Get into the vehicle
Why should l kill my son?
Didn't you kick your son
and push him to a police jeep?
Didn't you drive him out
and plant a coconut sapling?
Didn't you write as 'Devil' in his lorry?
-You only planted bomb to kill him
-Don't you too have a father?
Take your hand off
Don't beat the master
Don't beat him
Are you hitting my father?
Didn't you plant bomb in lorry?
Take my dad to hospital
Don't leave him alive
l will take care of the rest
Don't leave him
Dear son, l can't bear this sight
Son
