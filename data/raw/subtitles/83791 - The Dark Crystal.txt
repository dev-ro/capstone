NARRATOR:
Another world,
another time,
in the age of wonder.
A thousand years ago,
this land was green and good
until the Crystal cracked.
For a single piece was lost,
a shard of the Crystal.
Then strife began,
and two new races appeared:
The cruel Skeksis.
The gentle Mystics.
[THUNDER RUMBLES]
Here, in the castle of the Crystal,
the Skeksis took control.
Now the Skeksis gather
in the sacred chamber
where the Crystal hangs
above a shaft of air and fire.
The Skeksis, with their hard
and twisted bodies,
their harsh and twisted wills.
For a thousand years
they have ruled,
yet now, there are only 1 0.
A dying race
ruled by a dying emperor,
imprisoned within themselves
in a dying land.
Today, once more
they gather at the Crystal
as the first sun climbs
to its peak.
For this is the way of the Skeksis.
As they ravage the land,
so, too, they learn
to draw new life from the sun.
Today, once more
they will replenish themselves,
cheat death again
through the power
of their source,
their treasure, their fate:
The Dark Crystal.
But today, the ceremony of the sun
gives no comfort.
Today, an emperor lies dying.
Today, a new emperor
must seize the throne.
[♪♪♪]
A thousand years ago,
the Crystal cracked.
And here, far from the castle,
the race of Mystics came
to live in a dream of peace.
Their ways were the gentle ways
of natural wizards.
Yet now, there are only 1 0,
a dying race
numbly rehearsing the ancient ways
in a blur of forgetfulness.
But today,
the ritual gives no comfort.
Today, the wisest of the Mystics
lies dying.
Today, they summon the one
who must save them.

NARRATOR:
ln the valley of the Mystics,
there lives a Gelfling, Jen.
The Skeksis killed his family,
destroyed his clan.
Only Jen survived,
to be raised by the wisest
of the Mystics.
But there is a prophecy.
A thousand years have passed,
and now, once more the world
must undergo a time of testing.
Now it must be healed
or pass forever
into the rule of evil.
At this time,
Jen is the chosen one.
Today, Jen's pipe gives no comfort.
For today, his master lies dying,
and a journey must begin.
The journey of Jen.

Master, what's wrong?
You are in danger,

The Skeksis killed

the Crystal Shard.
The Crystal Shard?
To save our world, Gelfling,
you must find the Shard. . .
