Eating as usual I see, Algy!
I believe it is usual in good society
to take some slight refreshment
after morning exercise.
And what bring you to London, my dear Ernest?
Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else
should bring one anywhere?
Where have you been since last Thursday?
In the country.
What on earth do you do there?
When one is in town one amuses oneself. When
one is in the country one amuses other people.
And who are the people you amuse?
Oh, neighbours, neighbours.
Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?
Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.
How immensely you must amuse them!
Shropshire is your county, is it not?
Shropshire? Yes, of course.
By the way, Gwendolen is in town, isn't she?
She is.
In fact she's having tea with me this afternoon.
How perfectly delightful.
And so is Aunt Augusta.
You know, the way you flirt with Gwendolen
is almost as bad as the way
Gwendolen flirts with you.
I am in love with Gwendolen.
I have come up to town
expressly to propose to her.
I thought you had come up for pleasure?
I call that business.
How utterly unromantic you are!
I really don't see anything
romantic in proposing.
It is very romantic to be in love. But there is
nothing romantic about a definite proposal.
Why, one may be accepted.
One usually is, I believe.
Then the excitement is all over.
The very essence of romance is uncertainty.
If ever I get married, I'll certainly
try to forget the fact.
I have no doubt about that, dear Algy. The Divorce
Court was specially invented for people like you.
Divorces are made in Heaven. Marriages are...
Yes, Algy?
Oh, well, there's no use speculating
on this subject.
Or indeed your speculating on marrying Gwendolen.
Why on Earth you say that?
Well, in the first place girls never
marry the men they flirt with.
- Oh, that is nonsense!
- It isn't. It is a great truth.
It accounts for the extraordinary number
of bachelors that one sees all over the place.
In the second place, I don't give my consent.
Your consent!
My dear fellow, Gwendolen is my first cousin.
And before I allow you to marry her, you will
have to clear up the whole question of Cecily.
Cecily? What on earth do you mean?
What do you mean, Algy, by Cecily!
I don't know any one of the name of Cecily.
Do you mean to say you have had
my cigarette case all this time?
I wish to goodness you'd let me know. I've been
writing frantic letters to Scotland Yard about it.
I was very nearly offering a large reward.
Well, I wish you would offer one.
I happen to be more than usually hard up.
There is no good offering a large reward
now that the thing is found.
I think that is rather mean of you,
Ernest, I must say.
However, it makes no matter,
for, now that I look at the inscription,
I find that the thing isn't yours after all.
But of course it's mine. You have seen me
with it a hundred times.
You have no right whatsoever
to read what is written inside.
It is a very ungentlemanly thing
to read a private cigarette case.
Oh! It's absurd to have a hard and fast rule about
what one should read and what one shouldn't read.
More than half of modern culture
depends on what one shouldn't read.
I am quite aware of the fact, and I don't propose
to discuss modern culture with you.
It isn't the sort of thing one should talk of in
private. I simply want my cigarette case back.
Yes; but this isn't your cigarette case.
This cigarette case is a present from
some one of the name of Cecily,
and you said you didn't know any one
of that name.
Well, if you want to know,
Cecily happens to be my aunt.
- Your aunt!
- Yes.
Charming old lady she is, too.
Lives at Tunbridge Wells.
But why does she call herself little Cecily
if she is your aunt
and lives at Tunbridge Wells?
'From little Cecily with her fondest love.'
My dear fellow, what on earth is there in that?
Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall.
That is a matter that surely an aunt
may be allowed to decide for herself.
For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case.
Yes. But why does your aunt call you her uncle?
'From little Cecily, with her fondest love
to her dear Uncle Jack.'
There is no objection, I admit,
to an aunt being a small aunt,
but why an aunt, no matter what her size may be,
should call her own nephew her uncle,
I can't quite make out.
Besides, your name isn't Jack at all;
it is Ernest.
It isn't Ernest; it's Jack.
You have always told me it was Ernest.
You are the most Ernest-looking
person I ever saw in my life.
It is perfectly absurd your saying that
your name isn't Ernest.
It's on your cards. Here is one of them.
'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B. 4, The Albany.'
I shall keep this as a proof that your name
is Ernest if ever you attempt to deny
the fact to me, or to Gwendolen,
or to any one else.
Well, my name is Ernest in town
and Jack in the country,
and the cigarette case was given
to me in the country.
But that doesn't account for the fact that your
small Aunt Cecily, who lives at Tunbridge Wells,
calls you her dear uncle.
Come, old boy, you had much better
have the thing out at once.
My dear Algy, you talk exactly
like a dentist.
I may mention that I have always suspected
and now I am quite sure, that you are a
confirmed and secret Bunburyist;
Bunburyist?
What on earth do you mean by a Bunburyist?
I'll reveal to you the meaning of that
incomparable expression
when you are kind enough to tell me why you
are Ernest in town and Jack in the country.
Well, produce my cigarette case first.
Here it is.
Now produce your explanation,
and pray make it improbable.
There is nothing improbable
about my explanation at all.
Old Mr. Thomas Cardew, who adopted me when
I was a little boy, made me in his will
guardian to his grand-daughter,
Miss Cecily Cardew.
Cecily, who addresses me as her uncle
from motives of respect that you could
not possibly appreciate,
lives at my place in the country under
the charge of her admirable governess,
Miss Prism.
Where in that place in the country, by the way?
That is nothing to you, dear boy. You are
not going to be invited.
I may tell you candidly that it
is not in Shropshire.
I suspected that!
I have Bunburyed all over Shropshire on
two separate occasions. Now, go on.
When one is placed in the position
of guardian, one has to adopt
a very high moral tone on all subjects.
It's one's duty to do so.
And as a high moral tone can hardly be
said to conduce very much
to either one's health or one's happiness,
in order to get up to town I have always
pretended to have a younger brother
of the name of Ernest, who lives
here in the Albany,
and gets into the most dreadful scrapes.
- That, my dear Algy, is the whole truth.
- Oh, no.
What you really are is a Bunburyist.
I was perfectly right in saying
you were a Bunburyist.
You are one of the most advanced
Bunburyists I know.
What on earth do you mean?
You have invented a very useful
younger brother called Ernest,
in order that you may be able to come
up to London as often as you like.
I have invented an invaluable
permanent invalid called Bunbury,
in order that I may be able to go down
into the country whenever I choose.
Bunbury really is invaluable. If it wasn't
for Bunbury's
extraordinary bad health,
for instance,
I wouldn't be able to dine with you
at Willis's tonight,
for I have been really engaged to dine at
Aunt Augusta's for more than a week.
I haven't asked you to dine with me
anywhere tonight.
I know. You are absurdly careless
about sending out invitations.
It is very foolish of you. Nothing annoys people
more than not receiving invitations.
Algy, eh...
Seton!
Sir?
Seton I shall require a fresh gardenia
this afternoon.
At four o'clock precisely.
Very well, sir.
Ethel, come here!
Thank you, sir.
Giddap!
Did you hear what I was singing, Lane?
I didn't think it polite to listen, sir.
I'm sorry for that, for your sake.
I don't sing in tune, anybody can sing in tune.
But I sing with wonderful feeling.
Yes, sir.
You have got the cucumber sandwiches
for Lady Bracknell?
Yes, sir.
Excuse me, sir.
Have Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax arrived yet?
No, sir.
Mr. Ernest Worthing.
Jack! I don't seem to remember inviting you.
No. You are absurdly careless
about sending out invitations.
Cucumber sandwiches? Why such reckless
extravagance in one so young?
Don't you touch them. They are ordered
specially for Aunt Augusta.
- Well, you are eating them.
- That is quite a different matter. She's my aunt.
Have some bread and butter.
The bread and butter is for Gwendolen.
Gwendolen is devoted to bread and butter.
And very good bread and butter it is too.
My dear fellow, you need not eat as if
you were going to eat it all.
You behave as if you were married to her already.
You are not married to her already,
and I don't think you ever will be.
Now, Algy...
That must be Aunt Augusta.
Only relatives or creditors ever ring
in that Wagnerian manner.
Now, if I can get her out the way for 10 minutes,
in order that you may have the opportunity
for proposing to Gwendolen, may I dine
with you at Willis's tonight?
I suppose so, if you want to.
Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate
people who are not serious about meals.
Lady Bracknell and Miss Fairfax.
Good afternoon, dear Algernon,
I hope you are behaving very well.
I'm feeling very well, Aunt Augusta.
That's not quite the same thing.
In fact the two things rarely go together.
How do you do, Mr. Worthing.
Dear me, Gwendolen, you are smart!
I am always smart!
Aren't I, Mr. Worthing?
You're quite perfect, Miss Fairfax.
Oh! I hope I am not that.
It would leave no room for developments,
and I intend to develop
- in many directions.
- Gwendolen.
Won't you come and sit here, Gwendolen?
Thank you, mamma. I am quite
comfortable where I am.
I'm sorry if we are a little late, Algernon,
but I was obliged to call on dear Lady Harbury.
I hadn't been there since her
poor husband's death.
I never saw a woman so altered;
she looks quite twenty years younger.
And now I'll have a cup of tea,
and one of those nice cucumber
sandwiches you promised me.
Certainly, Aunt Augusta.
Good heavens! Lane!
Why are there no cucumber sandwiches?
I ordered them specially.
There were no cucumbers in the market
this morning, sir.
I went down twice.
- No cucumbers!
- No, sir.
Not even for ready money.
Thank you, Lane. That will do.
I am greatly distressed, Aunt Augusta,
about there being no cucumbers,
- not even for ready money.
- It really makes no matter, Algernon.
I had some crumpets with Lady Harbury,
who seems to me to be living
entirely for pleasure now.
I hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief.
It certainly has changed its colour.
From what cause I, of course, cannot say.
Forgive me, Aunt Augusta,
But I am afraid I shall have to give up
the pleasure of dining with you tonight.
I hope not, Algernon.
It would put my table completely out.
Well, the fact is I have just had a
telegram to say that my poor friend
Bunbury is very ill again.
They seem to think I should be with him.
Well, I must say,
I should be much obliged if you would
ask Mr. Bunbury, from me,
not to have a relapse on Saturday,
for I rely on you to arrange my music for me.
It is my last reception,
and one wants something that will
encourage conversation,
particularly at the end of the season
when every one has practically said
whatever they had to say,
which, in most cases, was probably not much.
I'll speak to Bunbury, Aunt Augusta,
if he is still conscious,
and I think I can promise you that
he'll be all right by Saturday.
Of course the music is a great difficulty.
But I'll run over the programme
I've worked out, if you will come
into the other room.
Thank you, Algernon.
That's very thoughtful of you.
I'm sure the programme will be delightful,
after a few expurgations.
French songs I cannot possibly allow.
People always seem to think
that they are improper,
and either look shocked, which is vulgar,
or laugh, which is worse.
German sounds a thoroughly respectable language,
and indeed, I believe it is so.
Gwendolen, you will accompany me.
Certainly, mamma.
Well, here is the programme I suggest,
Aunt Augusta.
Charming day it has been, Miss Fairfax.
Pray don't talk to me about the
weather, Mr. Worthing.
Whenever people talk to me about the weather,
I always feel quite certain they mean
something else.
And that makes me so nervous.
I do mean something else.
I thought so. In fact, I am never wrong.
I would like to be allowed to take advantage
of Lady Bracknell's temporary absence...
I would certainly advise you to do so.
Mamma has a way of coming back
suddenly into a room
that I have often had to speak to her about.
Miss Fairfax,
ever since I met you I have admired you more than
any girl I have ever met,
since I met you.
Yes, I am quite aware of the fact.
And I often wish that in public, at any rate,
you had been more demonstrative.
For me you have always had an
irresistible fascination.
Even before I met you I was far
from indifferent to you.
We live, as I hope you know, Mr Worthing,
in an age of ideals.
and my ideal has always been to love
some one of the name of Ernest.
There is something in that name which
inspires absolute confidence.
The moment Algernon first mentioned to me
that he had a friend called Ernest,
I knew I was destined to love you.
You really...
love me, Gwendolen?
Passionately!
Darling!
You don't know how happy you've made me.
My own Ernest!
But you don't really mean to say that you
couldn't love me if my name wasn't Ernest?
But your name is Ernest.
Yes, I know it is.
But supposing it was something else?
Do you mean to say you couldn't love me then?
That is clearly a metaphysical speculation,
and like most metaphysical speculations
has very little reference at all to
the actual facts of real life,
as we know them.
Personally, darling, to speak candidly,
I don't much care about the name of Ernest.
I don't think the name suits me at all.
It suits you perfectly. It is a divine name.
It has a music of its own.
It produces vibrations.
Well, I must say, Gwendolen,
that I think there are lots of other
much nicer names.
I think...
Jack, for instance.
- A charming name!
- Jack?
Oh, no!
There is very little music in the name Jack,
if any at all, indeed.
I have known several Jacks,
and they all, without exception,
were more than usually plain.
Besides, Jack is a notorious
domesticity for John!
And I pity any woman who is married
to a man called John.
No, the only really safe name
is Ernest.
Gwendolen...
I must get christened at once!
I mean, we must get married at once!
Married, Mr. Worthing?
Well..., surely.
You know that I love you, and you
have led me to believe,
Miss Fairfax, that you were not
entirely indifferent to me.
I adore you. But you haven't proposed to me yet.
Well...
May I propose to you now?
I think it would be an admirable opportunity.
And to spare you any possible
disappointment, Mr. Worthing,
I think it only fair to tell you quite
frankly before-hand
that I am fully determined to accept you.
Gwendolen!
Yes, Mr. Worthing?
What have you got to say to me?
But you know what I have got to say to you.
Yes, but you don't say it.
Gwendolen...
Will you marry me?
Of course I will, darling.
How long you have been about it!
I am afraid you have had very little
experience in how to propose.
My own one, I have never loved
any one in the world but you.
Yes, but men often propose for practice.
I know my brother does.
All my girl-friends tell me so.
What wonderfully blue eyes you have, Ernest!
They are quite, quite,
blue.
I hope you will always look at me just like that,
especially when there are other people present.
Mr. Worthing!
Rise, sir, from this semi-recumbent
posture. It is most indecorous.
Mamma! I must beg you to retire.
This is no place for you.
Besides, Mr. Worthing has not quite finished yet.
Finished what, may I ask?
I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
Pardon me, you are not engaged to any one.
When you do become engaged to some one,
I, or your father, should his health permit him,
will inform you of the fact.
An engagement should come on
a young girl as a surprise,
pleasant or unpleasant, as the case may be.
It is hardly a matter that she could be
allowed to arrange for herself.
And now I have a few questions
to put to you, Mr. Worthing.
While I am making these inquiries,
you, Gwendolen,
will wait for me below in the carriage.
Mamma!
In the carriage, Gwendolen!
Gwendolen,
the carriage!
Yes, mamma.
You can take a seat, Mr. Worthing.
Thank you, Lady Bracknell, I prefer standing.
I feel bound to tell you that you are not
down on my list of eligible young men,
although I have the same list as
the dear Duchess of Bolton has.
We work together, in fact.
But I am quite ready to enter your name,
should your answers be what a
really affectionate mother requires.
Do you smoke?
Well, yes, I must admit I smoke.
I am glad to hear it. A man should
have an occupation of some kind.
I have always been of opinion
that a man who desires to get married
should either know everything or nothing.
Which do you know?
I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.
I am pleased to hear it.
I do not approve of anything that
tampers with natural ignorance.
Ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit;
touch it and the bloom is gone.
The whole theory of modern education
is radically unsound.
Fortunately in England, at any rate, education
produces no effect whatsoever.
What is your income?
Between seven and eight thousand a year.
In land, or in investments?
In investments, chiefly.
That is satisfactory. What between the duties
expected of one during one's lifetime,
and the duties exacted from one after one's death,
land has ceased to be either
a profit or a pleasure.
It gives one position, but prevents
one from keeping it up.
That's all that can be said about land.
I have a country house with some land,
of course, attached to it, about
fifteen hundred acres, I believe; but I
don't depend on that for my real income.
In fact, as far as I can make out,
the poachers are the only people
who make anything out of it.
You have a town house, I hope?
A girl with a simple, unspoiled
nature, like Gwendolen,
can hardly be expected to reside in the country.
Well, I own a house in Belgrave Square, but
it is let by the year to Lady Bloxham.
Lady Bloxham?
No, I don't know her.
Oh, she goes about very little.
She is a lady considerably advanced
in years.
Ah, nowadays that is no guarantee
of respectability of character.
What are your politics?
Well, I am afraid I really have none.
I am a Liberal.
Oh, they count as Tories. They dine with us.
Or come in the evening, at any rate.
Now to minor matters.
Are your parents living?
I have lost both my parents.
To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing,
may be regarded as a misfortune;
to lose both looks like carelessness.
Who was your father?
I am afraid I really don't know.
The fact is, Lady Bracknell, I said
I had lost both my parents.
It would be nearer the truth to say
that my parents seem to have lost me.
I don't actually know who I am by birth.
I was...
Well, I was found.
Found!
The late Mr. Thomas Cardew, an old gentleman
of most charitable and kindly disposition,
found me,
and gave me the name of Worthing, because
he happened to have a first-class ticket
for Worthing in his pocket at the time.
Worthing is a place in Sussex.
It is a seaside resort.
Where did the charitable gentleman
who had a first-class ticket
for this seaside resort find you?
In a hand-bag.
A hand-bag?
Yes, Lady Bracknell. I was in a hand-bag.
A somewhat large, black leather hand-bag,
with handles to it.
An ordinary hand-bag in fact.
In what locality,
did this Mr. James, or Thomas, Cardew
come across this ordinary hand-bag?
In the cloak-room at Victoria Station.
It was given to him in mistake for his own.
The cloak-room at Victoria Station?
Yes. The Brighton line.
The line is immaterial.
Mr. Worthing,
I confess I feel somewhat bewildered
by what you have just told me.
To be born, or at any rate bred, in a hand-bag,
whether it had handles or not,
seems to me to display a contempt
for the ordinary decencies of family life
that reminds one of the worst
excesses of the French Revolution.
And I presume you know what that
unfortunate movement led to?
May I ask you then what you would advise me to do?
I need hardly say I would do anything in the
world to ensure Gwendolen's happiness.
I would strongly advise you, Mr. Worthing,
to try and acquire some relations
as soon as possible,
and to make a definite effort to produce
at any rate one parent, of either sex,
before the season is quite over.
Well, I don't see how I could possibly
do that, Lady Bracknell.
I can produce the hand-bag. It is in my dressing-
room. I really think that ought to satisfy you.
Me, sir! What has it to do with me?
You can hardly imagine that I and Lord Bracknell
would dream of allowing our only daughter,
a girl brought up with the utmost care,
to marry into a cloak-room,
and form an alliance with a parcel?
Good morning, Mr. Worthing!
Good morning, Lady Bracknell.
Algy, for heaven's sake stop playing
that ghastly tune.
Didn't it go off all right, old boy?
You mean to say Gwendolen refused you?
Gwendolen is as right as a trivet. As far
as she is concerned, we are engaged.
Her mother is an absolute Gorgon.
I don't really know what a Gorgon is, but
I am quite sure that Lady Bracknell is one.
In any case, she is a monster, without
being a myth, which is rather unfair.
Algy...
You don't suppose that Gwendolen will
become like her mother in about
one hundred and fifty years, do you?
All women become like their mothers.
That is their tragedy.
No man does. That's his.
Is that clever?
It is perfectly phrased!
And quite as true as any observation
in civilised life should be.
Did you tell Gwendolen the truth about your
being Ernest in town, and Jack in the country?
My dear fellow, the truth isn't quite
the sort of thing one tells to a nice,
sweet, refined girl.
Besides, before the end of the week,
I shall have got rid of Ernest.
My poor brother Ernest is going to be
carried off quite suddenly,
in Paris, by a severe chill.
But I thought you said that your..., your ward,
was a little too much interested in
your poor brother Ernest?
Won't she feel his loss a good deal?
Oh, Cecily is not a silly romantic girl,
I am happy to say.
She has got a capital appetite,
goes for long walks,
and pays no attention at all to her lessons.
I would rather like to see Cecily.
I shall take very good care you never do.
She is excessively pretty, and
only just eighteen.
Have you told Gwendolen that you have an
excessively pretty ward who is only just 18?
One doesn't blurt these things out to people.
Cecily and Gwendolen are perfectly certain
to be extremely good friends.
I'll bet you anything that half an hour after they
have met, they will be calling each other sister.
Women only do that when they have called
each other a lot of other things first.
Miss Fairfax.
Algy, kindly turn your back.
I have something very particular
to say to Mr. Worthing.
Really, Gwendolen, I don't think
I can allow this at all.
Ernest, we may never be married.
From the expression on mamma's
face I fear we never shall.
But although she may prevent us
from becoming man and wife,
nothing that she can possibly do can
alter my eternal devotion to you.
Your, your Christian name has an
irresistible fascination.
The simplicity of your character
makes you exquisitely
incomprehensible to me.
Your town address I have.
What is your address in the country?
The Manor House, Woolton, Hertfordshire.
There is a good postal service, I suppose?
It may be necessary to do something desperate.
The Manor House, Woolton,
Hertfordshire.
My own one!
- Cecily!
- Yes, Miss Prism?
Cecily!
Come here at once, child.
We should have been at our labours
quite twenty minutes ago, Cecily.
Unfortunately I was detained by a slight
mishap to my...
Oh, well, never mind to that.
Your German grammar is on the table.
But I don't like German.
It isn't at all a becoming language.
I know perfectly well that I look quite
plain after my German lesson.
Child, you know how anxious your guardian is
that you should improve yourself in every way.
He laid particular stress on your German,
as he was leaving for town yesterday.
Indeed, he always lays stress on your
German when he is leaving for town.
We will repeat yesterday's lesson. Genders.
Dear Uncle Jack is so very serious!
Sometimes he is so serious that I think
he cannot be quite well.
Your guardian enjoys the best of health,
and his gravity of demeanour
is especially to be commanded in one so
comparatively young as he is.
I know no one who has a higher sense
of duty and responsibility.
I suppose that is why he often looks a
little bored when we three are together.
Cecily! I am surprised at you.
Mr. Worthing has many troubles in his life.
Idle merriment and triviality would be
out of place in his conversation.
You must remember his constant anxiety
about that unfortunate young man,
his brother Ernest.
I wish Uncle Jack would allow that
unfortunate young man,
his brother Ernest,
to come down here sometimes.
Diminutives are always neuter.
That is, they belong to neither sex,
even one appearances are to the contrary.
As for example:
das Fräulein, young lady.
das Mädchen, the young girl.
Put away your diary, Cecily!
I really don't see why you should
keep a diary at all.
I keep a diary
in order to enter the wonderful
secrets of my life.
If I didn't write them down, I should
probably forget all about them.
Memory, my dear Cecily, is the diary
that we all carry about with us.
Yes, but it usually chronicles the
things that have never happened,
and couldn't possibly have happened.
I believe that Memory is responsible
for nearly all
the three-volume novels
that the library sends us.
Do not speak slightingly of the
three-volume novel.
I wrote one myself in earlier days.
Did you really, Miss Prism?
How wonderfully clever you are!
I hope it did not end happily?
I don't like novels that end happily.
The good ended happily, and the bad unhappily.
That is what Fiction means.
I suppose so. And was it ever published?
Alas! No.
The manuscript unfortunately was abandoned.
I use the word in the sense of lost
or mislaid.
Now to your work, child.
These speculations are profitless.
But I see dear Dr. Chasuble coming up
through the garden.
And how are we this morning?
Miss Prism, you are, I trust, well?
Dr. Chasuble! This is indeed a pleasure.
Miss Prism has just been complaining
of a slight headache.
I think it would do her so much good
to go for a short stroll
with you in the Park, Dr. Chasuble.
Cecily, I have not mentioned
anything about a headache.
No, I know that, dear Miss Prism, but I felt
instinctively that you had a headache.
Indeed I was thinking about that,
and not about my German lesson,
when the Rector arrived.
I hope, Cecily, you are not inattentive.
Oh, I am afraid I am.
That is strange.
Were I fortunate enough to be Miss Prism's pupil,
I would hang upon her lips.
I spoke metaphorically. My metaphor
was drawn from bees.
Mr. Worthing, I suppose, has not
returned from town yet?
We do not expect him till Monday afternoon.
Ah yes, he usually likes to spend
his Sunday in London.
He is not one of those whose
sole aim is enjoyment,
as, by all accounts, that unfortunate
young man his brother seems to be.
Sad. But I must not disturb Egeria
and her pupil any longer.
Egeria? My name is Laetitia, Doctor.
Laetitia. That is Latin for joy!
Yes. I shall...
I shall see you both no doubt at Evensong?
I think, dear Doctor, I will have
a stroll with you.
I find I have a headache after all,
and a stroll might do it good.
Cecily, you will read your Political
Economy in my absence.
The chapter on the Fall of the Rupee
you may omit.
It is somewhat too sensational.
Even these metallic problems
have their melodramatic side.
Horrid Political Economy!
Horrid Geography! Horrid, horrid German!
You are too much alone, dear Dr. Chasuble.
You should get married.
Oh, no.
You do not seem to realise, dear Doctor,
that by persistently remaining single,
a man converts himself into a
permanent public temptation.
A man should be more careful;
or he may lead weaker vessels astray.
But is a man not equally attractive when married?
No married man is ever attractive
except to his wife.
And often, I've been told, not even to her.
But doesn't that depend on the intellectual
sympathies of the woman?
Maturity can always be depended on.
Ripeness can be trusted.
Young women are green.
I spoke horticulturally.
My metaphor was drawn from fruits.
Fruits, yes.
Mr. Ernest Worthing has just driven
over from the station, Miss.
He has brought his luggage with him.
'Mr. Ernest Worthing, B4, The Albany'
Uncle Jack's brother!
Did you tell him Mr. Worthing was in London?
Yes, Miss. He seemed very much disappointed.
He said he would like to speak
to you privately for a moment.
I have left him in the morning room.
Thank you, Merriman.
I never met a really wicked person before.
I feel rather frightened.
I am so afraid he will look just
like every one else.
He does.
You are my little cousin Cecily, aren't you?
You are under some strange misapprehension.
I am not little. In fact, I believe I am
more than usually tall for my age.
But I am your cousin Cecily.
You, I see from your card,
are Uncle Jack's brother,
my cousin Ernest.
My wicked cousin Ernest.
Oh! I am not really wicked at all, cousin Cecily.
You mustn't think I am wicked.
If you are not,
then you have certainly been deceiving us all
in a very inexcusable manner.
I hope you have not been leading a double life,
pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.
That would be hypocrisy.
Oh! Of course I have been
- rather reckless.
- I am glad to hear it.
In fact, now you mention the subject,
I really have been
very bad in my own small way.
I don't think you should be so proud of that,
though I am sure it must have been very pleasant.
It is much pleasanter being here with you.
I can't understand how you are here at all.
Uncle Jack won't be back till Monday afternoon.
That is a great disappointment. I am obliged to
go up by the first train on Monday morning.
I have a business appointment that I am anxious
to miss?
Couldn't you miss it anywhere but in London?
No: the appointment is in London.
Well, I know, of course,
how important it is not to keep
a business engagement,
but still I think you had better wait
until Uncle Jack arrives.
I know he wants to speak to you
about your emigrating.
My what?
About your emigrating. He has gone
up to buy your outfit.
I certainly wouldn't allow Jack to buy my outfit.
He has no taste at all in neckties.
I don't think you will require neckties.
Uncle Jack is sending you to Australia.
Australia!
I'd sooner die.
Well, he said at dinner on Wednesday night,
that you would have to choose
between this world, the next world,
and Australia.
Oh, well! The reports I have of Australia
and the next world,
are not particularly encouraging.
This world is good enough for me, cousin Cecily.
Yes, but are you good enough for it?
Well, no, I'm not that.
That is why I'd like you to reform me.
You might make that your mission,
if you don't mind, cousin Cecily.
I'm afraid I have no time, this afternoon.
Well, would you mind if I reform
myself this afternoon?
It is rather romantic of you.
But I think you should try.
I will.
I feel better already.
You are looking a little worse.
That is because I am hungry.
How thoughtless of me.
I should have remembered that when one
is going to lead an entirely new life,
one requires regular and wholesome meals.
Might I have a buttonhole first?
I never have any appetite unless
I have a buttonhole first.
A Marechal Niel?
No, I'd sooner have a pink rose.
Why?
Because you are like a pink rose, Cousin Cecily.
I don't think it can be right for you
to say such things to me.
Miss Prism never talks like that.
Then Miss Prism is a short-sighted old lady.
You are the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Miss Prism says that all good looks are a snare.
They are a snare that any sensible
man would like to be caught in.
Oh, I don't think I would care
to catch a sensible man.
I shouldn't know what to talk to him about.
Mr. Worthing!
Mr. Worthing!
Dear Mr. Worthing, I trust this garb of woe
does not betoken some terrible calamity?
My brother.
More shameful debts and extravagance?
Dead!
Your brother Ernest dead?
Quite dead.
What a lesson for him!
I trust he will profit by it.
Mr. Worthing,
I offer you my sincere condolence.
Poor Ernest! He had many faults,
but it is a sad, sad blow.
Very sad indeed.
Were you with him at the end?
No. He died abroad; in Paris, in fact.
I had a telegram last night from
the manager of the Grand Hotel.
Was the cause of death mentioned?
A severe chill, it seems.
As a man sows, so let him reap.
Charity, dear Miss Prism, charity!
None of us are perfect.
I myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts.
Will the interment take place here?
No. He seems to have expressed a desire
to be buried in Paris.
In Paris!
I fear that hardly points to any very
serious state of mind at the last.
Uncle Jack!
I am so glad to see you back.
But what horrid clothes you have got on!
Cecily!
My child! my child!
Do look happy! I have got such
a surprise for you.
Who do you think is in the dining-room?
Your brother!
- Who?
- Your brother Ernest.
He arrived about half an hour ago.
What nonsense! I haven't got a brother.
Oh, don't say that.
However badly he may have behaved to you
in the past he is still your brother.
You couldn't be so heartless as to disown him.
And you will shake hands with him,
won't you, Uncle Jack?
These are very joyful tidings.
After we had all been resigned to his loss,
his sudden return seems to me
peculiarly distressing.
- Good heavens!
- Brother John,
I have come all the way from London
to tell you how very sorry
I am for all the trouble that I have caused you,
and that I intend to lead a better
life in the future.
Uncle Jack, you are not going to refuse
your own brother's hand?
Nothing will induce me to take his hand.
I consider his coming down here disgraceful.
He knows perfectly well why.
Uncle Jack, do be nice. There is some
good in every one.
Ernest has just been telling me about
his poor invalid friend Mr. Bunbury.
Oh! He has been talking about Bunbury, has he?
Well, I won't have him talk to you about
Bunbury or about anything else.
Of course I admit that all the faults
are on my side.
But I must say I think Brother John's coldness
to me on my first visit here, peculiarly painful.
Uncle Jack, if you won't shake hands
with Ernest I will never forgive you.
- Never forgive me?
- Never.
Never, never!
Well, this is the last time I shall do it.
I think we might leave the brothers together.
Cecily, you will come with us.
Certainly, Miss Prism.
My little task of reconciliation is over.
Algy, you, young scoundrel.
You must leave this place at once.
I don't want any Bunburying here.
Merriman,
order the dog-cart at once. Mr. Ernest
has been called back suddenly to town.
Yes, sir.
What a fearful liar you are, dear Jack. I
have not been called back to town at all.
- Yes, you have.
- I haven't heard any one call me.
Your duty as a gentleman calls you back.
I have never allowed my duty as a gentleman to
interfere with my pleasure to the smallest degree.
I can quite understand that.
Well, Cecily is a darling.
You are not to speak of Miss Cardew
that way. I don't like it.
Well, I don't like your clothes.
You look perfectly grotesque in them.
Why don't you go up and change?
It is childish to be in mourning for a man who
is staying for a week in your house as a guest.
You are not staying with me for a whole
week as a guest or anything else.
You are going to leave this afternoon.
By the 4:05 train.
I certainly should not leave you
as long as you are in mourning.
It would be most unfriendly.
If I were in mourning you would stay
with me, I suppose.
I should think it very unkind if you did not.
Well, will you go if I change my clothes?
Yes, if you are not too long.
I never saw a man take so long
to dress, with such little result.
Well, at any rate, that is better than
being always over-dressed as you are.
This Bunburying, as you call it, has
not been a great success for you.
I think it has been a great success.
Did you ring, sir?
Merriman, am I correctly
garbed for a christening?
No, sir.
Black is for funerals and weddings.
White is for christenings.
I'll lay out your tennis clothes.
Thank you, Merriman.
Oh, I thought you were with Uncle Jack.
He's gone to order the dog-cart for me.
Oh, is he going to take you for a nice drive?
He's going to send me away.
Then have we got to part?
I am afraid so.
It's a very painful parting.
It is always painful to part from people whom
one has known for a very brief space of time.
The absence of old friends one can
endure with equanimity.
But even a momentary separation
from anyone to whom one has
just been introduced is almost
unbearable.
Thank you.
The dog-cart is at the door, sir.
It can wait, Merriman for... five minutes.
Yes, Miss.
I hope, Cecily, I shall not offend you
if I state quite openly and frankly
that you seem to me to be in every way the
visible personification of absolute perfection.
I think your frankness does
you great credit, Ernest.
If you will allow me, I will copy
your remarks into my diary.
Do you really keep a diary?
I'd give anything to look at it.
- May I?
- Oh, no.
You see, it is simply a very young girl's record
of her own thoughts and impressions,
and consequently meant for publication.
When it appears in volume form
I hope you will order a copy.
But pray, Ernest, don't stop. I delight
in taking down from dictation.
I have reached 'absolute perfection'.
You can go on. I am quite ready for more.
Oh, don't cough, Ernest. I don't know
how to spell a cough.
Cecily,
ever since I first saw your wonderful
and incomparable perfection,
I have dared to love you wildly,
passionately, devotedly,
hopelessly.
I don't think you should tell me that
you love me wildly,
passionately, devotedly, hopelessly.
Hopelessly doesn't seem to make
much sense, does it?
Cecily!
The dog-cart is waiting, sir.
Tell it to come round next week, at the same hour.
Very good, sir.
Uncle Jack would be very much annoyed if he knew
you're staying on till next week at the same hour.
Oh, I don't care about Jack.
I don't care for anybody in the world but you.
I love you, Cecily. Will you marry me?
Of course.
- We have been engaged for the last 3 months.
- The last 3 months?
Yes, it will be exactly three months on Thursday.
How did we become engaged?
Well, ever since dear Uncle Jack first confessed
to us that he had a younger brother
who was very wicked and bad,
you of course have formed the chief topic of
conversation between myself and Miss Prism.
And of course a man who is much talked
about is always very attractive.
One always feels there must be
something in him, after all.
I daresay it was foolish of me,
- but I fell in love with you, Ernest.
- Darling!
And when was the engagement actually settled?
On the 22nd of February last.
Worn out by your entire ignorance
of my existence,
I determined to end the matter
one way or the other,
and after a long struggle with myself
I accepted you.
Under that dear old chandelier there.
The next day I bought this ring in your name,
and this is the bangle
with the true lover's knot that
I promised you always to wear.
Did I give you this? It's very pretty, isn't it?
Yes, you've wonderfully good taste, Ernest.
It's always been my excuse
for your leading such a bad life.
And this...
This is the box
in which I keep all your dear letters.
My letters!
But, my own sweet Cecily,
I never wrote you any letters.
You need hardly remind me of that, Ernest.
I remember only too well I was forced
to write all your letters for you.
I wrote three times a week, sometimes oftener.
- Oh, let me read them.
- Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.
They would make you far too conceited.
The three you wrote to me
after our engagement had been broken off
are so beautiful, and so badly spelled,
that even now I can hardly read them
without crying a little.
But was our engagement ever broken off?
Of course it was.
On the 22nd of last March.
You can see the entry if you like.
'today I broke off my engagement with
Ernest. I feel it is better to do so.
The weather still continues charming.'
But why on earth did you break it off?
What had I done?
I had done nothing at all.
Cecily, I am very much hurt indeed
that you broke it off.
Particularly when the weather was so charming.
It would hardly have been a really
serious engagement
if it hadn't been broken off at least once.
But I forgave you before the week was out.
What a perfect angel you are!
You won't ever break off our engagement
again, will you?
I don't think I could now that I have
actually met you.
Besides, of course, there is
the question of your name.
Of course.
You must not laugh at me, darling,
but it had always been a girlish dream of mine
to love some one by the name of Ernest.
There is something in that name
that seems to inspire absolute confidence.
Indeed, I pity any poor married woman
whose husband is not called Ernest.
But, my dear child, do you mean to say
you could not love me
- if I had some other name?
- But what name?
Oh, any name you like.
Algernon, for instance.
But I don't like the name of Algernon.
I really don't see why you should
object to the name of
Algernon. It is not a bad name at all.
In fact, it is rather an aristocratic name.
Half the chaps who get into the
Bankruptcy Court are called Algernon.
But seriously, Cecily.
If my name was Algy, couldn't you love me?
I might respect you, Ernest,
I might admire your character,
but I fear that I should not be able
to give you my undivided attention.
Cecily, your vicar here is, I suppose,
thoroughly experienced
in the practice of all the rites and
ceremonials of the Church?
Oh, yes. Dr. Chasuble is a most learned man.
I must see him at once on a most important
christening. I mean on most important business.
- I won't be away more than half an hour.
- Ernest!
Considering that we have been engaged
since February the 22nd,
and that I only met you today for the first time,
I think it is rather hard
that you should leave me for so long
a period as half an hour.
Couldn't you make it twenty minutes?
I'll be back in no time.
- Mr. Worthing.
- Good afternoon, Dr. Chasuble.
I trust you'll excuse
this relapse into the arms of Morpheus.
In other words, 40 winks.
Dr. Chasuble, I suppose you know
how to christen all right?
I mean, of course, you are continually
christening, aren't you?
It is, I regret to say, one of my
most constant duties in this parish.
I have often spoken to the poorer
classes on the subject.
- But they don't seem to know what thrift is.
- Well.
But is there any particular infant
in whom you are interested, Mr. Worthing?
- Of course! Your brother.
- I beg your pardon?
Your brother, I know, is unmarried, but...
Dr. Chasuble, it is not for any child.
The fact is, I was thinking
of getting christened myself.
This afternoon, if you have nothing better to do.
But surely, Mr. Worthing, you have
been christened already?
I don't remember anything about it.
But have you any grave doubts on the subject?
I certainly intend to have.
Unless, of course, you think
I'm a little too... old now.
Not at all.
The sprinkling, and, indeed, the immersion
of adults is a perfectly canonical practice.
Immersion!
You need have no apprehensions.
Sprinkling is all that is necessary,
or indeed I think advisable. Our weather
is so changeable.
At what hour would you like
the ceremony performed?
Well, I thought I would trot round about
five, if that would suit you too?
Perfectly, perfectly! In fact I have two
similar ceremonies to perform at that time.
A case of twins
that occurred recently in one of the
outlying cottages on your own estate.
Poor Jenkins the carter,
a most hard-working man.
Well, I don't see much fun in being
christened along with other babies.
It would be childish. Would half-past five do?
Admirably! Admirably!
- Till half-past five.
- Half-past five at the font.
Come in.
Dr. Chasuble?
What a perfect angel you are, Cecily.
And then is when he knelt.
Yes, I am sure that is how it was.
A Miss Fairfax has called to
see Mr. Worthing, Miss.
On very important business, Miss Fairfax states.
Isn't Mr. Worthing in the library?
Mr. Worthing went over in the direction
of the Rectory some time ago, Miss.
Pray ask the lady to come out here;
Mr. Worthing is sure to be back soon.
And, Merriman, you may bring tea.
Yes, Miss.
Oh, dear.
One of the many good elderly women
associated with Uncle Jack in some of his
philanthropic work in London, I suppose.
Miss Fairfax.
Miss Fairfax?
Pray let me introduce myself to you.
My name is Cecily Cardew.
What a very sweet name!
Something tells me that we are
going to be great friends.
I like you already more than I can say.
My first impressions of people are never wrong.
How nice of you to like me so much
after we have known one another
for such a comparatively short time.
Shall we sit over there?
- I may call you Cecily, may I not?
- With pleasure.
And you will always call me Gwendolen, won't you?
If you wish.
Then that is all quite settled, is it not?
I hope so.
Cecily,
mamma, whose views on education
are remarkably strict,
has brought me up to be extremely short-sighted;
it is part of her system;
do you mind my looking at you through my glasses?
Oh! not at all, Gwendolen.
I am very fond of being looked at.
You are here on a short visit, I suppose.
- Oh no! I live here.
- Really?
Your mother, no doubt, or
some female relative of advanced
years, resides here also?
Oh no! I have no mother,
nor, in fact, any relations.
I am Mr. Worthing's ward.
It is strange he never mentioned to me
that he had a ward.
How secretive of him!
He grows more interesting hourly.
I am not sure, however, that the news
inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight.
In fact, if I may speak quite candidly,
Pray do!
I think that whenever one has anything
unpleasant to say, one should always
be quite candid.
Well, to speak with perfect candour, Cecily,
I wish that you were fully forty-two,
and more than usually plain for your age.
Ernest has a strong upright nature.
I beg your pardon, Gwendolen, did you say Ernest?
Yes.
Oh, but it is not Mr. Ernest Worthing
who is my guardian.
It is his brother, his elder brother.
Ernest never mentioned to me
that he had a brother.
I am sorry to say that they have not been
on good terms for a long time.
That accounts for it.
Of course you are quite,
quite sure that it is not Mr. Ernest
Worthing who is your guardian?
Quite sure.
In fact,
I am going to be his.
I beg your pardon?
Dearest Gwendolen, there is no reason why
I should make a secret of it to you.
Our little county newspaper is sure
to chronicle the fact next week.
Mr. Ernest Worthing and I
are engaged to be married.
My darling Cecily,
I think there must be some slight error.
Mr. Ernest Worthing is engaged to me.
The announcement will appear in the Morning
Post on Saturday at the latest.
I am afraid you must be under some misconception.
Ernest proposed to me
exactly ten minutes ago.
It is certainly very curious,
for he asked me to be his wife
yesterday afternoon at 5.30.
If you would care to verify the incident,
pray do so.
I never travel without my diary. One
should always have something sensational
to read in the train.
I am so sorry,
dearest Cecily,
if it is any disappointment to you,
but I am afraid I have the prior claim.
It would distress me more than I can
say, dearest Gwendolen,
if it caused you any mental or physical anguish,
but I feel bound to point out that
since Ernest proposed to you
he has clearly changed his mind.
If the poor fellow has been entrapped
into any foolish promise
I shall consider it my duty
to rescue him at once,
and with a firm hand.
Whatever unfortunate entanglement
my dear boy may have got himself into,
I will never reproach him with it
after we are married.
Do you allude to me, Miss Cardew,
as an entanglement?
You are presumptuous.
On an occasion of this kind it becomes more
than a moral duty to speak one's mind.
It becomes a pleasure.
Do you suggest, Miss Fairfax, that I
entrapped Ernest into an engagement?
How dare you?
This is no time for wearing the shallow
mask of manners.
When I see a spade I call it a spade.
I am glad to say I have never seen a spade.
It is obvious that our social spheres
have been widely different.
Shall I lay tea here as usual, Miss?
Yes, as usual.
Are there many interesting walks
- in the vicinity, Miss Cardew?
- Oh, yes.
A great many. From the top of one of the
hills quite close one can see five counties.
Five counties!
I don't think I should like that; I hate crowds.
I suppose
that is why you live in a town?
I had no idea there were any flowers
in the country.
Oh, flowers are as common here,
Miss Fairfax, as people are in London.
May I offer you some tea?
Thank you.
Sugar?
No, thank you.
Sugar is not fashionable any more.
Cake?
Or bread and butter?
Bread and butter, please.
Cake is rarely seen at the best houses nowadays.
Hand that to Miss Fairfax.
You have filled my tea with lumps of sugar,
and though I most distinctly asked for
bread and butter, you have given me cake.
I am known for the gentleness of my disposition,
and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature,
but I warn you, Miss Cardew, you may go too far.
To save my poor, innocent, trusting boy
from the machinations of any other girl
there are no lengths to which I would not go.
From the moment I saw you I distrusted you.
I felt that you were false and deceitful.
I am never deceived in such matters.
My first impressions of people are
invariably right.
It seems to me, Miss Fairfax, that I
am trespassing on your valuable time.
No doubt you have many other calls
of a similar character to make
in the neighbourhood.
Gwendolen!
My own Ernest!
Gwendolen! Darling!
A moment!
May I ask if you are engaged to be married
to this young lady?
To dear little Cecily! Good Heavens, no! What has
put such an idea into your pretty little head?
Thank you. You may!
I knew there must be some
misunderstanding, Miss Fairfax.
The gentleman whose arm is at present
round your waist
is my dear guardian, Mr. John Worthing.
I beg your pardon?
This is Uncle Jack.
Jack? Oh!
Cecily!
Here is Ernest.
My own love!
A moment!
Are you by any chance engaged
to be married to this young lady?
To what young lady?
- Good heavens! Gwendolen!
- Yes! To good heavens Gwendolen,
I mean, Gwendolen.
Of course not! What could have put such
an idea into your pretty little head?
Thank you... You may.
I felt there must be some slight error,
Miss Cardew.
The gentleman who is now embracing
you is my cousin,
Mr. Algernon Moncrieff.
Algernon Moncrieff?
Are you called Algernon?
I cannot deny it.
Is your name really John?
Well, I could deny it if I liked.
I could deny anything if I liked. But
my name certainly is John.
A gross deception has been practised
on both of us.
My poor wounded Cecily!
My sweet wronged Gwendolen!
You will call me sister,
will you not?
There is just one question I would like
to be allowed to ask my guardian.
An admirable idea!
Mr. Worthing, there is just one question
I would like to be permitted to put to you.
Where is your brother Ernest?
We are both engaged to be married to
your brother Ernest,
so it is a matter of some importance
to us to know
where your brother Ernest is
- at present.
- Gwendolen and Cecily.
I will tell you quite frankly
that I have no brother Ernest.
I have no brother at all.
No brother at all?
None!
Have you never had a brother of any kind?
Never. Not even of any kind.
I am afraid it is quite clear, Cecily,
that neither of us is engaged
to be married to any one.
It is not a very pleasant position
for a young girl
suddenly to find herself in. Is it?
Let us go into the house.
They will hardly venture to come after us there.
No.
Men are such cowards, aren't they?
This ghastly state of things is what
you would call Bunburying, I suppose?
Yes, the most wonderful Bunbury
I have ever had in my life.
Well, the only small satisfaction I get
out of the whole of this wretched business
is that your friend Bunbury, dear Algy,
is quite exploded.
And a very good thing too.
Your brother is a little off colour, isn't he,
dear Jack? And not a bad thing either.
As for your deceiving a sweet, simple,
innocent girl like Miss Cardew, I can only say...
it's inexcusable. To say nothing of
the fact that she is my ward.
I can see no possible defence at all
for your deceiving a clever,
experienced young lady like Miss Fairfax. To
say nothing of the fact that she is my cousin.
I simply wanted to be engaged to
Gwendolen, that is all. I love her.
Well, I simply wanted to be engaged
to Cecily. I adore her.
There is certainly no chance of your
marrying Miss Cardew.
I don't think there is much likelihood, Jack,
of you and Miss Fairfax being united.
Guard!
Will you be good enough to inform me
how soon this
railway train arrives at Woolton?
Now, let me see...
There's Gotherington... No, we've passed it.
And there's Goostrey Halt,
Sopley,
Cobbler's Corner,
Combe Brissett,
High Totten,
Low Totten, Little...
How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins
when we are in this horrible trouble, I can't
imagine. You seem to be perfectly heartless.
Well, I can't eat muffins in an agitated manner.
The butter would probably get on my cuffs.
One should always eat muffins quite calmly.
It is the only way to eat them.
I say it's perfectly heartless to be
eating them at all.
When I am in trouble, eating is the only
thing that consoles me.
They are eating muffins!
Algy, I wish to goodness you would go.
But I've just made arrangements with Dr. Chasuble
to be christened at 6:00 under the name of Ernest.
I made arrangements myself to be christened at
5.30 and I naturally will take the name of Ernest.
I have a perfect right to be christened. There is
no evidence that I was ever christened by anyone.
It is entirely different with you.
You have been christened already.
Yes, but I have not been christened for years.
Yes, but you have been christened.
That is the important thing.
Quite so. So I know my constitution can stand it.
It might make you very unwell.
You can hardly have forgotten that some one very
closely connected with you was nearly carried off
- in Paris this week by a severe chill.
- You talk as if a severe chill were hereditary.
It usen't to be, I know, but it may be now.
Science is always making wonderful
improvements in things.
They're looking this way.
What effrontery!
They're approaching.
That's very forward of them.
Let us preserve a dignified silence.
Certainly. It is the only thing to do now.
Mr. Worthing,
I have something very particular to ask you.
Much depends on your reply.
Your common sense is invaluable, Gwendolen.
Mr. Moncrieff, kindly answer me
the following question.
Why did you pretend to be my guardian's brother?
In order that I might have an
opportunity of meeting you.
That certainly seems a satisfactory
explanation, does it not?
Yes, dear, if you can believe him.
Mr. Worthing, what explanation
can you offer me
for pretending to have a brother?
Was it in order that you might have
an opportunity of coming up to town
to see me as often as possible?
Can you doubt it, Miss Fairfax?
I have the gravest doubts on the subject.
But I intend to crush them.
Their explanations appear to have
the stamp of truth upon them.
Especially Mr. Worthing's.
I am more than content with
what Mr. Moncrieff has said.
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.
Then you think we should forgive them?
Yes.
I mean no.
True! I had forgotten.
There are principles at stake that
one cannot surrender.
Which of us should tell them?
The task is not a pleasant one.
- Could we not both speak at the same time?
- An excellent idea!
I nearly always speak at the same
time as other people.
Will you take the time from me?
Your Christian names are still an
insuperable barrier. That is all!
Our Christian names! Is that all?
But we are going to be christened
this afternoon.
For my sake you are prepared
to do this terrible thing?
I am.
To please me you are ready to
face this fearful ordeal?
I am.
How absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes!
Where questions of self-sacrifice are
concerned,
men are infinitely beyond us.
We are.
- Darling!
- Darling!
Gwendolen!
What does this mean?
Merely that I am engaged to Mr. Worthing, mamma.
Come here.
Sit down.
Sit down immediately.
Mr. Worthing, you will clearly understand
that all communication between
yourself and my daughter
must cease immediately from this moment.
On this, as indeed on all points, I am firm.
I am engaged to be married
to Gwendolen, Lady Bracknell!
You are nothing of the kind, sir.
And now, as regards Algernon!
Algernon!
Yes, Aunt Augusta.
May I ask if it is in this house
that your invalid friend Mr. Bunbury resides?
Oh! No! Bunbury doesn't live here.
Bunbury is somewhere else at present.
In fact, Bunbury is dead,
Dead!
When did Mr. Bunbury die?
Oh! I killed Bunbury this afternoon.
I mean Bunbury died this afternoon.
What did he die of?
Bunbury?
Oh, he was quite exploded.
Exploded!
Was he a victim of a revolutionary outrage?
My dear Aunt Augusta, I mean he was found out!
The doctors found out that Bunbury
could not live, that is what I mean,
so, Bunbury died.
And now that we have finally got
rid of this Mr. Bunbury,
may I ask, Mr. Worthing,
who is that young person
whose hand my nephew Algernon is holding
in what appears to me to be a
peculiarly unnecessary manner?
That lady is Miss Cecily Cardew, my ward.
I am engaged to be married to Cecily,
Aunt Augusta.
I beg your pardon?
Mr. Moncrieff and I
are engaged to be married, Lady Bracknell.
Indeed!
I think some preliminary inquiry on my
part would not be out of place.
Mr. Worthing,
is Miss Cardew at all connected
with any of the larger railway
stations in London?
I merely require information.
Until yesterday I had no idea
that there were any families
or persons whose origin was a Terminus.
Miss Cardew is the grand-daughter
of the late Mr. Thomas Cardew
of 149 Belgrave Square, South West;
Gervase Park, Dorking, Surrey; and the Sporran,
- Fifeshire.
- That sounds not unsatisfactory.
Three addresses always inspire confidence,
even in tradesmen.
But what proof have I of their authenticity?
I have carefully preserved the Court Guides
of the period. They are open to your
inspection, Lady Bracknell.
I have known strange errors in that publication.
Miss Cardew's family solicitors are Messrs.
Markby, Markby, and Markby.
Markby, Markby, and Markby?
A firm of the very highest position
in their profession.
I have also in my possession,
you will be pleased to hear,
certificates of Miss Cardew's birth,
baptism, whooping cough,
registration, vaccination, confirmation,
and the measles; the German
and the English variety.
A life crowded with incident, I see;
but somewhat too exciting for a young girl.
Gwendolen,
the time approaches for our departure.
We have not a moment to lose.
As a matter of form, Mr. Worthing,
I had better ask if Miss Cardew
has any little fortune?
Only about one hundred and thirty
thousand pounds in the Funds. That is all.
Goodbye, Lady Bracknell.
So pleased to have seen you.
One moment, Mr. Worthing.
A hundred and thirty thousand
pounds! And in the Funds!
Miss Cardew seems a most attractive
young lady, now that I look at her.
Few girls of the present day
have any really solid qualities,
qualities that last, and improve with time.
We live, I regret to say,
in an age of surfaces.
Come over here, dear.
Pretty child!
Your dress is sadly simple
and your hair seems almost as
Nature might have left it.
But we can soon alter all that.
A thoroughly experienced French maid
produces a really remarkable result
in a very brief space of time.
There are distinct social possibilities
in your profile.
Cecily is the dearest, sweetest,
prettiest girl in the world.
And I don't care twopence
her social possibilities.
Never speak disrespectfully of Society, Algernon.
Only people who can't get into it do that.
I suppose you know that Algernon has
nothing but his debts to depend upon.
But I do not approve of mercenary marriages.
When I married Lord Bracknell
I had no fortune of any kind.
But I never dreamed of allowing that
to stand in my way.
Well, I suppose I must give my consent.
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
Cecily, you may kiss me!
Thank you, Lady Bracknell.
You may also address me as Aunt
Augusta for the future.
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
The marriage, I think, had better
take place quite soon.
Thank you, Aunt Augusta.
To speak frankly,
I am not in favour of long engagements.
They give people an opportunity of finding
out each other's characters before marriage,
which I think is never advisable.
I beg your pardon for interrupting
you, Lady Bracknell,
but this engagement is quite out of the question.
I am Miss Cardew's guardian, and she cannot marry
without my consent until she comes of age.
That consent I absolutely decline to give.
Upon what grounds may I ask?
Algernon is an extremely,
I may almost say ostentatiously,
eligible young man.
He has nothing, and looks everything.
What more can one desire?
It pains me very much to have to speak frankly
to you, Lady Bracknell, about your nephew,
but the fact is that I do not approve
at all of his moral character.
I suspect him of being untruthful.
Untruthful!
My nephew Algernon untruthful?
Impossible! He was at Oxford.
I fear there can be no possible doubt
about the matter.
This afternoon during my temporary absence
in London on an important question of
romance,
he obtained admission to my house by means
of the false pretence of being my brother.
Under an assumed name he drank,
I've just been informed by my butler, an entire
pint bottle of Perrier-Jouet, Brut, '89;
a wine I was specially reserving for myself.
Continuing his disgraceful deception, he
succeeded during the course of the afternoon
in alienating the affections of my only ward.
He subsequently stayed to tea,
and devoured every single muffin.
What makes his conduct more heartless is that he
was aware from the first that I have no brother,
that I never had a brother,
and that I don't intend to have a
brother, not even of any kind.
Mr. Worthing, after careful consideration
I have decided entirely to overlook
my nephew's conduct towards you.
That is very generous of you, Lady Bracknell.
My own decision, however, is unalterable.
I decline to give my consent.
Come here, sweet child.
How old are you?
Well, I am really only eighteen, but I always
admit to twenty when I go to evening parties.
You are perfectly right in making
some slight alteration.
A woman should never be really
accurate about her age.
It looks so calculating.
Eighteen, admitting to twenty at evening parties.
Well, you will soon be of age and free
from the restraints of tutelage.
So that I do not think your guardian's
consent is a matter of any importance.
Pray excuse me for interrupting you once again,
Lady Bracknell, but I think it is only fair
to point out that under to the terms
of her grandfather's will
Miss Cardew does not legally come of
age until she is
thirty-five.
That does not seem to me to be a
very grave objection.
Thirty-five is a very attractive age.
London society is full of women
of the highest birth
who, of their own free choice, have
remained thirty-five for years.
Lady Dumbleton is an instance in point.
To my own knowledge she has been thirty-five
ever since she arrived at the age of forty,
which was many years ago now.
I see no reason why our dear Cecily
should not be even more attractive
at the age you mention
than she is at present.
There will be a large accumulation of property.
Algy,
could you wait for me till I was thirty-five?
Of course I could, Cecily. You know I could.
Yes, I felt that instinctively.
But I couldn't wait all that time.
- But Cecily!
- My dear Mr. Worthing,
as Miss Cardew states positively that she
cannot wait until she is thirty-five,
a remark which I am bound to say seems to
me to show a somewhat impatient nature,
I would beg of you to reconsider your decision.
But my dear Lady Bracknell, the matter is
entirely in your own hands.
The moment you consent to my marriage
with Gwendolen,
I will most gladly allow your nephew to
form an alliance with my ward.
That is not the destiny I propose for Gwendolen.
Algernon, of course, can choose for himself.
Come, dear. We have already missed five,
if not six, trains.
To miss any more might expose us to
comment on the platform.
Everything is quite ready for the christenings.
The christenings, sir!
Is not that somewhat premature?
Both these gentlemen have expressed
a desire for immediate baptism.
At their age?
The idea is grotesque and irreligious!
Algernon, I forbid you to be baptized.
I will not hear of such excesses.
Am I to understand
that there be no christenings
at all this afternoon?
I don't think that, with things as they
are, Dr. Chasuble,
they would be of much practical value
to either of us.
As your present mood seems to be
one peculiarly secular,
I will return to the church at once.
Indeed, I have just been informed
- Miss Prism has been waiting for me.
- Miss Prism!
Did I hear you mention a Miss Prism?
Yes, indeed. I am on my way to join her.
Kindly allow me to detain you for one moment.
Is this Miss Prism a female of repellent aspect,
remotely connected with education?
She is the most cultivated of ladies, and
the very picture of respectability.
It is obviously the same person.
May I ask what is her position in your household?
Miss Prism, Lady Bracknell, has for the 
last three years been Miss Cardew's
esteemed governess and valued companion.
In spite of what I hear of her, I must
see her at once.
Let her be sent for.
She approaches;
she is nigh.
I was told you expected me in the
vestry, dear Canon.
I have been waiting for you there for
an hour and three-quarters.
Prism!
Come here, Prism!
Prism! Where is that baby?
Twenty-eight years ago, Prism,
you left Lord Bracknell's house,
in charge of a perambulator containing
an infant of the male sex.
You never returned.
Some few weeks later
the perambulator was discovered at midnight,
standing by itself
in a remote corner of Bayswater.
It contained the manuscript of a
three-volume novel of more than usually revolting
sentimentality.
But the baby was not there!
Prism! Where is that baby?
Where is that baby, Prism?
Lady Bracknell,
I admit with shame that I do not know.
I only wish I did.
The plain facts of the case are these.
On the morning of the day you mention,
a day that is for ever branded on my memory,
I prepared as usual to take the baby
out in its perambulator.
I had also with me
a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag
in which I had intended to place
the manuscript of a work
of fiction that I had written
during my few unoccupied hours.
In a moment of mental abstraction, for
which I never can forgive myself,
I deposited the manuscript in the bassinette,
and placed the baby in the hand-bag.
- But where did you deposit the hand-bag?
- Do not ask me, Mr. Worthing.
Miss Prism, this is a matter of no small
importance to me. I insist on knowing
where you deposited the hand-bag
that contained that infant.
I left it in the cloak-room of one of the
larger railway stations in London.
What railway station?
Victoria.
The Brighton line?
The Brighton line.
Gwendolen, wait here for me.
If you are not too long, I will wait
here for you all my life.
This suspense is terrible.
- Miss Prism, is this the handbag?
- Let me look.
Examine it carefully before speaking. The happines
of more than one life depends on your answer.
Thank you.
It seems to be mine.
Yes, here is the injury it received
through the upsetting
of a Gower Street omnibus in
younger and happier days.
Here is the stain on the lining
caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage,
an incident that occurred at Leamington.
And here, on the lock, are my initials.
I had forgotten that in an extravagant mood
I had had them placed there.
The bag is undoubtedly mine.
I am delighted to have it so
unexpectedly restored to me.
It has been a great inconvenience
being without it all these years.
Miss Prism,
more is restored to you than the hand-bag.
I am the baby that was placed in it.
You?
Yes...
Mother!
Mr. Worthing! I am unmarried.
Unmarried!
I do not deny that is a serious blow.
But who has the right to cast a stone
against one who has suffered?
Cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly?
Why should there be one law for men,
and another for women?
Mother, I forgive you.
Mr. Worthing, there is some error.
There is the lady who can tell you
who you really are. Oh, dear.
Lady Bracknell, I hate to seem inquisitive,
but would you kindly inform me who I really am?
You are the son of my poor sister,
Mrs. Moncrieff,
and consequently Algernon's elder brother.
Algy's elder brother!
Then I have a brother after all. I knew I had
a brother! I always said I had a brother!
Cecily, how could you have ever doubted
that I had a brother?
Dr. Chasuble, my unfortunate brother.
Miss Prism, my unfortunate brother.
Gwendolen, my unfortunate brother.
Algy, you young scoundrel, you will have to
behave with more respect to me in the future.
You have never behaved to me like
a brother in all your life.
Well, not till today, old boy, I admit. I tried
my best, however, though I was out of practice.
My own!
But what own are you?
What is your Christian name, now that
you have become some one else?
Your decision on the subject of my
Christian name is irrevocable, I suppose?
I never change, except in my affections.
What a noble nature you have, Gwendolen!
Then the question must be cleared
up once and for all.
Aunt Augusta, at the time when Miss Prism
left me in the hand-bag,
had I been christened already?
Every luxury that money could buy,
including christening,
had been lavished on you by your
fond and doting parents.
Then I was christened! That is settled.
Now, what was my Christian name?
Let me know the worst.
Being the eldest son you were naturally
called after your father.
Yes, but what was my father's
Christian name?
I cannot at the moment recall what
the General's Christian name was.
I have no doubt he had one.
He was eccentric, I admit.
But only in later years.
Algy! Can't you recollect what our
father's Christian name was?
My dear boy, we were never even on speaking
terms. He died before I was a year old.
His name would be in the Army Lists of
the period, I suppose, Aunt Augusta?
The General was essentially a man of peace,
except in his domestic life.
But I have no doubt his name would appear
in any military directory.
The Army Lists of the last forty years are here.
These delightful records should have been
my constant study.
M... Generals...
Magley, Maxbey,
Maxbohm... What ghastly names.
Merkly, Migsby, Mobbs.
Moncrieff!
Lieutenant 1840, Captain, Lieutenant-Colonel,
Colonel, General 1869,
Christian name,
Ernest John.
Gwendolen, I always told you that my
name was Ernest, didn't I?
Ernest. My own Ernest!
Cecily, at last!
Laetitia, at last!
Gwendolen, at last!
My nephew,
you seem to be displaying signs of triviality.
On the contrary, Aunt Augusta,
I've now realised for the first time in my life
the vital Importance of Being Earnest.
