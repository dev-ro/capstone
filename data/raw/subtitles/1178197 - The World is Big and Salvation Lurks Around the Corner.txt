My life started on 15 September 1975.
Somewhere in the Balkans where
Europe ends but never starts.
This is my mother
- gentle and kind.
Lives in her own world
of books and music.
Hesitant and beautiful
as the Gobelins she sews.
My father - never still
in a hurry not to miss something.
Making plans, looking for
new paths to follow.
Grandma in feverish search of
sugar for my birth.
Addicted to pastries she was convinced
the world spun on a lump of sugar.
Got sugar today?
Grandma Sladka (pastry)
Was her nickname.
Sugar in today?
- Not yet.
But the world is big and she knew
that sugar cane grew far away.
What's in today?
- Sugar, Cuban sugar!
Hey, comrade, come back!
- Stand in the line! Keep order!
Aren't you ashamed, comrade?
The Caf√©
- the secret capital of backgammon!
That day my Grandpa
fought a fierce battle.
The winner would be
the new King of Backgammon.
They call my Grandpa Bai Dan.
Dan - short for Yordan,
and 'Bai'out of respect
for his special touch with the dice.
Not everyone can throw!
Bai Dan - master dice-thrower!
Playing since early morning
- the outcome was near.
And that's when I popped out.
The Boys. Double six.
- Great!
The new King of Backgammon
is called Bai Dan!
This is a candy sponge
a baklava, a butter roll.
Sladke, where's the sugar from?
- Fidel Castro sent it from Cuba.
The world is big and salvation
lurks around the corner.
To my grandson Alexander!
Cheers!
That's where my story begins.
The story of Alexander Georgiev,
Sashko for short.
The world is big and everyone
calls you what they like.
(Germany)
THE WORLD IS BIG AND SALVATION
LURKS AROUND THE CORNER
Hello, yes
Yes.
Ok, ok,
The children...
They had an accident.
Sashko is alive, in hospital.
Yana and Vasko...
Hi. How do you feel?
Do you understand my question?
What's your name?
I don't know.
(Germany)
(X ray room)
Good morning. Can I help you?
- Good morning.
I'm looking for my grandson
Alexander Georgiev.
Room 17, down the corridor.
Thank you.
It's me, Sashe. I just came...
Grandpa's boy. How are you?
I'm your Grandpa, from Bulgaria.
Don't you recognize me?
Are you all right?
Tell me you are!
I don't know if...
Please, I... I don't know you...
Sashe, Sashe... Have a good look,
It's me, your Grandpa!
I came from home
Remember?
I taught you to play backgammon.
You remember the song?
Backgammon's played
by those who can,
Backgammon's played
by those who can't, too.
What's going on?
Tell the gentleman to leave
I don't know him.
Please, leave the room at once.
Sashe...
Backgammon's played
by those who can,
Backgammon's played
by those who can't, too.
Play on bravely, have no fear
at the worst you get beaten up.
One, two, three, four, five, six
six, five, four, three, two, one
One, two, three, four, five, six, six
five, four, three, two, double six.
Can I throw the dice, Grandpa?
Attention all!
Pejo, give a drink to everyone
Drinks are on me today.
My grandson asked for the dice!
To the young master
Make way for youth.
Come on, Master!
Word of honour:
We don't play
for money, only for honour.
You promise?
- I promise.
Take the dice!
You should believe the dice.
Think of two numbers!
A six and a one.
Now throw it.
Bravo!
Sorry, I had to warn you
he wouldn't recognise you.
I'll talk to him, prepare him for...
- Doc, how is he?
Is he going to be alright?
Fortunately there's
no serious physical damage.
He has retroactive amnesia
- Amnesia?
Yes. He can't remember
anything before the accident.
He doesn't even know
that his parents are dead.
This news might hurt him even more.
(Alexander Georgiev)
Sashe, your Grandpa!
Give it to me!
Give it to him!
Don't torture the kid...
Happy birthday, Sashko!
- Thank you.
And play so much you break the box.
Thank you, Grandpa.
Now you have gone over the top!
And a photo...
Say Cheese
Cheese!
Blow the candles.
Excellent, my boy!
Alexander Georgiev. Please
leave a message after the tone.
Mr Georgiev, it's Vitechek
from the translation agency
about the instructions on
vacuum cleaner PX 510.
You promised to finish it
last week, Please call.
I brought you some photos.
Who are these people?
- Your mother and father.
Grandma Sladka.
This here is you and that's me.
Your mum and dad.
I don't remember them.
This was your birthday.
You were seven.
Don't you remember? Really?
- I just don't.
They are all strangers
I don't remember anyone.
Mum, dad... not myself
That's enough!
You'll remember, Sashe
I'm sure you will!
I found that backgammon set
I made for you at your place last night.
You've entered my place? How?
Not quite legally...
Not quite...
You just intrude like that...
Nice, superb...
So you are my Grandpa
from Bulgaria after all! Nice touch!
But it's time to go. Just leave
I don't remember you!
Sashe...
I don't remember you!
The man can't hit the board
Needs a basin to hold his dice!
With the people's militia here
don't make an ass of me.
Comrade militiaman, why
this warm Lenin look at me?
You hang here all the time
should know how to play.
Let's play a game
But you won't, because
if you don't play, you don't lose.
But we all play here.
If you just watch you'll get hit
by a board on the head.
He's leaving
Vasko, the Personnel department
called for you!
Well, Georgiev...
Too bad, Georgiev
too bad indeed!
Why? What's up?
- Strange things
You served in a missile regiment
Once you quarrelled and beat up
the officer on duty.
That's what it says here.
Six months in the cooler
expulsion from the Comsomol.
Discharged in 1971, entrance
exams at the Machine Institute
but you forgot to mention
the expulsion from the Comsomol.
False references from the Army
here's a copy.
The comrades overlooked it
you entered and graduated.
But one day everything
sees the light of day.
What shall I do with you?
You are a gifted lad...
You have a kid
Let it grow up safe and healthy.
It's human to err. You're young
there's a life to be lived.
What do you want from me?
Your father-in-law
they call him Bai Dan...
He was a cyclist
won the Bulgaria Tour in 54
Gets a scholarships, studies
2 years in GDR.
During the Hungarian Uprising
organizes student protests.
Repatriated to Bulgaria
what does he do?
Blows up Stalin's monument
with dynamite.
Sentenced to death. Pardoned.
15 years in prison and still
he hasn't learned sense.
He is such a big mouth -
talking against the authorities.
No way! Only backgammon
is in his head.
Only backgammon...
We won't bother him for selling
backgammon boards, for now...
His workshop in the cellar...
- What do you want from me?
All his anti-authority blabbering
you put clearly in writing.
All backgammon players' too
And your colleagues, in case...
You bring all the reports to me.
Sign this declaration!
Let me think about it.
Think, but don't be long
bad things may happen...
And if I do not sign it?
- Bad, too bad for you.
Cancellation of your diploma
dismissal, your wife too...
Prison sentence for forgery...
Won't that be enough?
There's more...
If you don't want to talk,
let's play a game.
I don't care for such games.
Come on, just one game
- I'm short on luck,
Backgammon has nothing
to do with luck,
I taught you to play years ago.
You see, you have not forgotten.
Snake eyes
- That's not so good.
It's OK. There's no bad dice
just bad players.
Depends how you play it
You have to move your checkers
to bear them off
and try to block
the opponent's checkers.
Just by closing the points
by two checkers.
Here - snake eyes
the smallest dice but a big throw.
Blocking the Bosporus here
and the Dardanelles there,
so the enemy is stranded
at Black Sea and can't move.
Yeah!
That's double six
The highest throw
But you could lose on that too
the way my bar point is blocked.
But there's always a next throw.
Comrades we lost
a great friend of Bulgaria.
The secretary general of CPSU
the Comrade Leonid Brezhnev.
Suggest to send a mourning
telegram to the Soviet Embassy.
The friendship of our countries
is eternal,
Soviet Union and
People's Republic of Bulgaria.
CPSU - BCP!
CPSU - BCP!
Vasko? You're dripping wet!
You want something to warm up?
- Yes.
Shall we have a game of backgammon?
You want to tell me something?
You're blocking my game
I can't continue.
Look around
there's always an opening.
Whatever I throw is useless
If the situation looks hopeless,
just change your tactics
- How?
You take a risk, make your move
and hope for the best.
We have to emigrate!
What?
- To the West, to Germany.
I am serious, we'll do it
this summer.
Just like going to the seaside
But how...
- I have to leave!
What about Sashko?
- He's coming with us.
He'll have a better future there
Do you understand?
- You know what you're saying?
I am not going anywhere!
(Mum: Yana Dad: Vasko)
Too bad. But one never knows...
I hope the boy will recover.
I was aware he wasn't around but
knew nothing of his misfortune.
Another cup of tea?
Do you know his friends?
- No, he was always alone.
What about a girlfriend?
- Never saw one.
He is confused.
Been watching
him for three weeks now -
keeping to his bed
as if waiting for Doomsday...
I'll take this walking stick
for a couple of days.
You're welcome.
Thank you, good neighbour.
Stop this damned thing!
It's time for the news!
I'll show you news!
Get up!
Are you nuts?
You have to move, boy!
Not glued to the box!
It's just brainwashing!
Don't make me take out the bed.
Get up!
You are insane!
- Come on, get up!
Right! Finally!
This boy can jump!
More, can you go on?
- Just let go!
I'll take you out of this room.
It hurts, stop it!
Don't try to run my life!
You call this a life?
Among cardboard boxes
for vacuum cleaners?
Translating manuals
Lying here...
And grumbling like an old woman.
You need a change, boy!
There's nothing better
than the change.
Coward!
Stop it!
I promise to keep hitting you
until you come with me.
This is the news!
I am coming
- Get the backgammon set!
See what you did!
Now we go to gammon - double game
Gammon!
You beat me again
- It's up to you only
Me only? Dice is just chance
- Chance? - Yes
Where is that chance? You' ve got
the dice in your hand, don't you?
What flick and spin you give them
what angle...
You need a double
If you are to beat me
Bravo, master. First victory
We'll celebrate
you're re covering.
If you say so...
- Let me show you something
Backgammon has six points
Here they are The King's point and the
Paradise' point are the most important.
The points are closed one by one
Today you made the first.
You have five more to do.
And when you're done
you'll be ready -
you'll remember everything
I am a little scared
How come?
Scared that I won't recognise
mum and dad
when they come
Just as I didn't recognise you.
Now tell me who they are
and who I am.
You are Alexander.
It is a rare luck
to be christened Alexander
You renounced Satan?
I did!
- You embraced Christ?
I did!
- Do you believe in Him?
I do!
What name shall we announce?
Alexander
God's servant Alexander
is baptised
in the name of the Father
the Son and the Holy Spirit.
I wish my self in the New Year
me you and Sashko
to start a new life - in the West.
Free, rich and happy!
Shall we?
Shall we?
- Yes, sure.
Dear compatriots, Happy 1983!
Now, Happy New Year!
Cheers!
Blackbird young sweetly sang
in a forest with a twang.
Stamped his foot in a boot
splintered up a root.
Walked about till very late
many flies he caught and ate...
How dare you! This is a hospital!
How irresponsible!
Out!
Who are you threatening?
Sashe, Sashe, these bums won't cure you
They don't care about you
And they lie to you all the time
- What about?
Look...
Look here...
Your mum and dad
will never come.
How do you mean - never?
They are dead.
They died in the accident.
You were together.
This is not true!
- It is, it is very true, my lad.
They are not coming.
But you can bring them back
in your memory
when we go where I came from,
where you came from.
I will help you.
Out, leave! Immediately!
Sashe, Just pull yourself together and leave!
Leave the Gobelins. I'll buy you
real paintings over there.
No room for my things
but you take that box!
That box is a gift for Sashko
from your father. You take trash!
If it's not tied to you escaping
it's trash to you.
My escaping? It's all for us
Leave it to you and we'll
just rot in this dump.
You lived in a dump before
marrying me, didn't you?
Is there anything about me
you care for? Is there?
Keep it down, your
parents will hear us
So what?
I am fed up with this!
To hide, to lie to them...
God knows when I'll see them again.
I'm not going!
You're not?
- I'm not going!
Go or stay, you know best!
Sashe, come here.
It's alright...
It's alright.
For cranberries a kiddy wandered out
Two baskets he did fill and sung aloud
But entered too deep in the wood
the day grew dark as did his mood
The kid did cry and tried to call
his mother but who could hear him...
Let me see!
- That's the kid.
It was dark in the forest
no light, no bird.
Will the kid be scared or stop?
No, for mum is waiting home.
Suddenly a gleam of hope appears
a white path through his tears.
The friendly path invited him:
- Do step on me, you will be home.
An hour you'll have to walk
my promise is not idle talk,
The child started running fast
the path did also run with him.
And finally the good white path
did take him home to mum.
And do take care, Vasko.
Have a nice trip
Yana.
Sashe, come say good-bye
to Grandma and Grandpa
Sashe, if you want to tell me
something very important,
just tell it to a white cloud
floating in the sky,
it'll come and tell me
- Like sending a letter?
Right
And how do you throw the dice?
I think of a number
throw it and win!
Excellent, master!
Be good, my sweetie-pie!
(The tomb of Vasko & yana)
Mum and dad, God rest their souls.
God rest their souls.
What's this for? - We'll travel with it
Can't we take a bus, a plane?
Who rides a bike today?
- This is not a bike but tandem
Give me your luggage.
Alexander Georgiev
are you ready to go?
No. We haven't got helmets
Is it permitted...
It is. I asked the Pope
He said: "Yes!" Come on...
Is that a new trick?
I won't doall the hard work,
I'm doing the steering
That's more important
You have no idea
where you want to go.
I'm the brain, you're the muscle!
- Watch the road or we'll crash!
What's our destination?
Turkey
India, China
The Silk Road
Why hang this flower pot up front?
It's a present for your Grandma
To plant in her garden
I have to pee
- Right now? Go, quickly!
This is the border
It's Italy on the other side
Come on! Now!
Vasko, our things...
- No! Don't! Go! Go!
Come on! Just go!
(Temporary Shelter)
Come on, sign it!
The Commandant asks you to sign.
What is this?
Declaration to accept the rules
at the camp voluntarily
But it's all in Italian...
I'm sorry
but you have to sign it
This is East Europe side
Over there are the Arabs
These are Czechs. The other rooms
are for Rumanians and Hungarians.
Don't worry
it'll be OK Let me explain
You applied for political asylum
But it's ruled out in Italy
You have to apply for another country
and it takes time
It's a limited choice: Australia
South Africa Argentina
For the States you need
an invitation and a guarantee.
That's the situation. Cheer up!
It's done. Thank you, Chicago
Come, I'll introduce you.
Nice to meet you
I'm Ivo the Chicago. Welcome.
Thank you. Yana and Sasho
Sasho, is this a smudge?
Got it! One up for me!
We are on a spaghetti diet
morning evening noon
and all weekdays - spaghetti
But come a holiday surprise!
Spaghetti again!
That's the situation!
I like spaghetti especially
spaghetti Bolognese
Yes, Bolognese, from Bologna!
I quite enjoyed it at first
Both Bolognese, Milanese but
they all end up Shitnese
You'll get fed up eventually
- Sure, after a month's diet
It's been three years for me!
You serious?
- Yes, sure, three years.
I am only in my ninth month...
My sister and me
- it's almost two years now
We're just for a short stay
Everybody says that
but it'll stretch to three-four years.
I am leaving!
Where?
I am leaving. Let me go!
Stop
- Let me go!
Wait!
- Take me back home! You hear?
I hate you!
Today we'll talk about fantasy
- What? Fantasy?!
Yes, the elixir of every game
Tell me, what make's this car?
- A bone-shaker.
A Brand new limousine!
- Is that so? Well, true!
And who's inside?
- How should I know?
Use your imagination
- A depressed man.
Why is he so blue?
- He has a big credit to pay back,
And a fat wife throwing
his money out the window
instead ofjumping out herself.
Your vision is improving!
Next car?
A pretty woman behind the wheel
the radio blasting...
What's on the radio?
- How should I know?
Try to remember!
- I can't.
Use your imagination!
Some babble... I don't know...
Coughing, sneezing...
Interview with a pop singer
some crazy old bitch...
Shouldn't you be dead by now?
"Oh, yes. Thank you..."
Full of spite, but good!
You're getting on my nerves
- Go on with the radio.
Stop, it's stupid!
- Go on with the radio.
All right. Radio...
Dear listeners
this is Radio Balkan...
Sure! Good morning!
- Good morning with Traffic news
Traffic jam on Rout A22
An urgent message from Grandma:
"Water my flower and eat well."
We won't forget, Grandma Sladka?!
The weather: Heavy snow and
strong winds. Attention...
