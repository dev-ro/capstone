Come on, beautiful!
Open up!
Ursula, you're my dream girl.
I've been dreaming
about you for months.
My name's not Ursula.
What is it?
Suzanne.
How old are you?
I don't know.
Have any kids?
Why not?
Ursula, be mine!
Only three bucks!
Damn bitch!
Always suspicious.
Always messing around.
I'm getting fed up.
Got any bright ideas?
I might if I had some bread.
Hold on.
What's up?
An idea.
What?
It's staring you in the face.
It's still warm.
Don't start in again.
Feels good, doesn't it?
How's that for a smooth ride?
Hydraulic suspension.
Come on, don't crap your pants.
Want some toilet paper?
He'll get his wheels back.
Don't worry.
Right where he left them.
He'll never press charges.
"Beauty Salon"
Well...What do you know?
Don't you feel stupid?
Dangerous characters.
Not bad, huh?
You can't get any?
Like a little feel?
Hands up. And fast!
Tough luck, boys.
I'm trying out my new gun.
It's my third car stolen this year.
I'm a little fed up. Get it?
We didn't steal it.
We just borrowed it.
We returned it, didn't we?
Here it is.
It never even moved.
Tell that to the cops.
Go call them.
No, wait!
Why bother the cops?
We didn't hurt anyone.
We just went for a ride.
Just killing time...
...Iike we were hitch-hiking...
...and you picked us up.
You weren't around.
That's all.
It's no big deal.
We just used up a little gas.
Look, not a scratch...
...oh, the starter needs adjusting.
If you want me to fix it,
I've got a screwdriver.
Go ahead...
Listen to their sob story.
You'll cry your heart out.
Wait...Iisten.
I said hands up.
Hey, Carnoles!
Need the police?
I'll call them.
Wait...
There's something you ought to know...
We had a run-in...
...recently in a five-and-dime store.
So we're kind of on parole.
Next time it's jail.
We don't want to go to jail, sir.
Poor slobs.
I'll put you in jail myself.
Hey, how 'bout giving
these hippies a haircut?
We're in France, all right!
Watch out!
Jean-Claude!
What?
I'm all bloody.
Get a doctor.
What a mess!
What's going on?
Have to get another car.
Got any dough?
Something better.
You're not leaving me?
What's wrong?
You don't like me?
Endo, endocrinology, what's it mean?
How should I know?
Hurry up, it's hurting worse!
And "oto-rhino-laryngology? "
I'm not a dictionary.
Any doctor's OK.
All I know is I'm pissing blood.
He's hurt! You fix him up...
...or I'll smash your head in. Get it?
Abrasion of the left testicle.
It took 3 stitches.
The bullet missed the artery...
He sure was lucky.
We're always lucky. Incredibly lucky.
The golden touch.
Glad to hear it. I was worried about you.
Don't worry, just hand over your dough.
I don't have any on me...
...I have to go to the bank.
No kidding?
I just used my last check.
You're not putting me on?
Just a thought...
You can take a look.
No, thanks.
I'd rather make sure
the kids are tucked in.
They might have a nightmare
and throw the covers off...
...they could get a sore throat.
Wait.
Give them something, Bruno.
Here...It's all I have.
Your wallet, Bruno!
You punk. Dirty little bastard!
What's with this chick?
Just spreads her legs...
...and stares at the ceiling...
Son of a bitch!
What are you complaining about?
You got off, didn't you?
Like screwing a piece of meat.
Get up now. He needs to rest.
Look at this dumb chick!
No panties!
Hurry up.
I'd like to go now...
Don't you like panties?
You going to answer me or not?
Look what your friend did to me.
You should take it easy.
What if I can't get it up again?
Look, you bitch!
You're going to be all right...
It's not my fault!
I didn't shoot you!
I don't give a shit about his car.
He your boyfriend?
No, my boss.
Does he lay you?
If you think it's fun...
But why no panties?
He won't let me.
It turns him on.
Even with your period?
Lay off.
Your papers!
What's your job?
Shampoo girl.
What kind of shampoo? Pubic hair?
Or bald heads?
I'd like to get some sleep.
I have to work at 9.
Shut up!
Shut up!
You hearing voices now?
Guess what we'll do to him?
Can you guess?
- Jean-Claude?
- Yeah?
Listen to me.
I'm listening...
Since he's really hung up on his car...
...Iet's give it back. Real polite.
We'll leave it at the side of the road.
You with me?
Yeah...Sure.
That's just for starters...
The cops find it
and the bastard gets it back.
In tip-top shape.
He drives off happy as a clam,
whistling away...
...only what he doesn't know is...
...we've fiddled with his car.
Unscrewed the front wheel.
It's just hanging on by a thread...
...and not for long...
One day he's driving down
a nice straight road...
...going over a hundred...
...smoking a manly cigarette...
...a Marlboro...
Then, all of a sudden...
off comes the wheel...
How's that grab you?
Right on a curve...Trees all over!
Absolutely!
The bastard asked for it!
You must be tired...
Why don't you sit down?
Since we'll probably never
see you again...
...we'd like to ask you for a favor.
Come on...I'll be late to work.
Well, let's hear it...
We'd like to touch you for good luck.
OK, but make it quick!
I don't want any trouble at work.
I never heard about
it's being so lucky...
Sure it is!
Touching something dirty
brings good luck.
Like stepping in shit.
You bastards!
Sure you're in the right place, Sonny?
Got one for me?
Got a nice trim there around the ears...
Watch out or I'll trim yours!
Saturday haircut day?
No, I work on Saturdays.
Big shoplifting day.
I catch dozens of punks like you.
That's wonderful.
If everyone were that dedicated...
Bet you're an ace at Blackjack...
How'd you guess?
I know you inside out.
Lots of guys like you around.
They stick to you like flies
these days.
Looking for trouble?
No, just like a pair of jeans...
It's my brother's birthday.
Down there, on the right...
...just past the television sets.
I'll frisk you later.
Hey, look!
Must be your first paycheck!
Not a chance.
I met this rich lady...
She's hooked on me!
Ursula's very generous.
Congratulations!
You don't need that badge...
...your hair tonic gives you away!
You're lucky I'm in a good mood today.
Me too. Life is beautiful.
I'd almost like to touch you...
If I touch you, you'll know it!
You feel up the salesgirls?
I'll throw you out on your ass.
Understand!
Little punk.
We're not the same breed.
Definitely not.
I kind of like you, though...
I know. Me too.
I feel like getting closer to you.
Too bad I'm in a hurry.
I could've invited you to lunch.
You little bastard!
Isn't it nice here?
When no one bugs us...
...we're content with simple pleasures.
Just like flies,
always buzzing around our balls.
Like we're indispensable.
Everything falls apart without us.
Don't go so fast!
My balls hurt!
Then stand up!
I win the prize!
Stupid ass...
Damn!
What a dumb way to get caught...
He's still thirsty.
Don't go away!
Give little Jesus a drink.
Here.
Take it and give him a drink.
Why? I don't want your money.
Come on...
Don't give us a hard time...
Your tits really turn me on.
I'm meeting my husband.
He's in the Army. At Angelras.
That so?
It's cozier like this.
Isn't this nice?
What do you want?
Not a thing...
Can't a guy count his money?
Your guy got a pass?
Yes.
When you'd see him last?
Two months ago.
Oh, boy! What a time
you're going to have!
Where'll you go?
I don't know. A hotel...
Here...
That's for you.
What for?
I'd like you to...
...stay in the fanciest hotel in town.
In the most expensive room.
With a bathroom
for your smelly boyfriend.
Come all over a great big bed.
Order champagne on a silver tray...
...and drink it in bed.
Sound good to you?
Yes...
But you have to earn it.
How?
I'd like you to nurse my buddy...
He's an orphan and he loves milk...
He'd enjoy it...
Well, what do you think?
Yeah...
Go ahead...She's all yours.
What's wrong? No good?
I can't get it up.
Angelras! I have to get off now.
He doesn't know what he's in for!
We sure warmed her up!
What about me?
Why can't I get it up?
The bastard!
I sure hope he gets his...
Right on a nice, sharp curve...
Think he's got his car back?
You're nuts! Not yet!
What are cops for?
Where's the fire?
I can't wait!
Hope he's on the accident list!
Know anyone here?
So why'd we come?
Give me time to think!
I'm not a computer!
Just take it easy.
Track 4, train number 1 41 1...
For Bridolle.
All aboard...Close the doors, please.
What's the matter?
What does "off season" mean to you?
That's the big question...
Pretty bleak place...
Isn't this comfy?
Not even a lump of sugar!
But there's lots of toilet paper...
...super-soft. Interested?
Isn't that touching...
Daddy...Mommy...Jacqueline...
Poor Jacqueline...
...all alone with her folks.
That's Jackie's bed...
Look what she left us...
Isn't that cute?
How old do you think she is?
I don't know. Thirteen...
...fourteen, at the most...
No, she's much older. Much!
At least sixteen...
Take a whiff...
Let's see...
You're right.
Oh, my God...
At least...
A real young lady...
Like she just took them off...
...a minute ago.
Jacqueline!
Hey, Jacqueline!
Jean-Claude.
- Jean-Claude?
- What?
I don't have a hard-on!
So what? Me neither.
In whose honor should we get it up?
I always wake up with one.
You're probably too filthy...
There's so much dirt...
...it'd take a bulldozer to dig it out.
Come on. It feels great...
I can't. I'll start bleeding again.
Well, how about your feet?
We could clean them up a bit.
Purify the air...
You'll be all right...
Stop worrying. It's all in your head...
...and you're getting obsessed...
Feels good, huh?
Feel any lighter?
You're real pretty!
You're almost desirable...
Hands off!
What hands?
Yours, faggot!
Don't be ashamed...
I'm not ashamed. I just don't want to.
I don't want to...
How do you know?
If you've never tried it?
You think you turn me on?
I need a real woman.
Something attractive.
Not repulsive.
I heard someone...
You'll get yours, fairy!
I'm humiliated!
You're not humiliated!
It's OK between friends...
I'm sick of this place.
Shitty town...
Shitty country...
I get screwed everywhere I go...
Shut your mouth or I'll fill it with sand.
Jean-Claude...
Why can't I get it up?
I said not to worry. Cheer up!
A real pain-in-the-ass!
I need a girl...
...a sexy one...who loves me.
There must be some tail
around somewhere...
That's for sure...
...but we can't attract attention...
We're not giving up sex
to avoid the cops?
Besides, our money's running out...
How much is left?
20 bucks...
Holy shit!
What is it?
I've got it!
What?
Everything!
Everything?
Listen...
We're looking for ass...I found some.
We need bread...I found some.
Come on!
What are you doing? Hey, guys!
Hey...What about my bike?
Hi...
Shut the door!
If you want to screw me,
go right ahead...
Don't talk like that...
We didn't come for that...
We'll screw you if and when we want...
Why'd you come?
How's your pimp?
What pimp?
He's not my pimp!
You can all go screw yourselves!
Say that again...!
Did I hear you right?
Nothing...
Hurting your little tits?
You're a slut, huh?
Repeat what I say!
You're a whore...?
Who screws her pimp...
...and doesn't wear panties?
What a bitch...
Your pimp get his car back?
Is he happy...
...to get his car back?
I don't give a damn!
Answer me!
Well he sold it...
He sold his car?
Who to?
Some garage. They'll sell it for him.
Dirty bastard!
I pity the poor guy who buys
that heap!
Well? Do I take off the rest?
After all your whining
about getting it up...!
Take it easy...I'm getting seasick.
Calm down...
Don't get so excited.
Take your time...
Negotiate...
Nice going...Good show!
3 1 /2 minutes...A real sprinter!
You're at the finish...
...but she's still on the starting line.
This time...
It's my turn...if you don't mind.
Now...take a lesson from me.
Admire the craftsmanship...
There...Like that...
The keynote is flexibility...
Easy does it...the night is young.
Now, rev her up a little...
...to get the motor going.
Then gently...Slowly again.
Very gentle...
Take your time...Make her impatient.
Isn't that right, my love?
And now, shift into fourth!
Hurting you?
No.
You sure?
Yeah, yeah...
Just asking...
Usually, they suffocate...
No, I'm O. K...
You didn't know I'm a lady killer?
Isn't it good?
It's fine...
Are you always like that?
Like? Like what?
I don't know...
...cold and passive...
Think your bullshit turns her on?
She likes me better.
Well, go ahead...
She's all yours...
Bet you can't make her come!
Look at this piece of...
Never saw such a cold fish!
Can't you make an effort?
Show some enthusiasm?
How can she,
with you yelling in her ear?
Stop bugging us...
I'd rather take a leak anyway.
Nothing but yogurt!
You're not having a good time?
Sure I am...Why?
O. K...Let's try something else.
Turn over.
Eyes shut?
No.
Biting her lips?
No.
Sweating under the arms?
No.
Damn! I give up...
Why wear myself out...
...on a stupid little bitch...
...a cold fish.
Look at her...totally numb...
Bet she'd stay like that for hours...!
You can turn over again. We've had it...
Ever hear of modesty?
She couldn't care less...
Sorry, we're not very romantic...
You never come?
I don't know...I don't mind.
How are other girls?
They're alive!
They moan...Iook at you gratefully...
They roll their eyes...
You could teach me...
How about it?
I've had enough...
...she's all yours...
Well...
Here, nice Pento...
Oh...he likes that...a nice little snack.
Kiss me.
Where's the cash register?
Not now...
Now's the time for money...
Nothing but small change...
Looks like a booby-trap...
Use your knife.
Of course! There's an alarm on it.
There an alarm on it?
I said is there an alarm on it?
You asleep?
Screw you! I said screw you!
I'll give you an alarm, all right!
You out of your mind?
I want you to kiss me...
...I'm not just a sex machine!
I said stop it!
Stop or I'll shoot!
You bastards!
You bastards!
You're not leaving me here?
Hey, guys?
You're not leaving me alone?
Another game?
These girls are a drag...It's 1 1.
Why waste the night clowning around...
...we'll end up horizontal anyway!
What makes you so sure?
Think we're easy lays?
Sure...Just like all the rest of them...
Come on...We've got a brand new car
with reclining seats...
Can you believe it?
He's out of his mind.
Frankly...We don't give a damn!
We don't care if we get laid or not.
We're getting fed up
with dog meat like you!
Know what dog meat's like?
Soft meat. Soft and mushy.
They're not worth it...
The place is full of girls...
Look...They've been eyeing us
for an hour.
You think you're pretty hot stuff...
Let's go, Ginette!
Go ahead, leave...We're not going
to cry.
You know what you are...? Hicks!
Don't make me laugh...
You still have your price tags on.
What about the drinks?
So we have to pay?
Smart ass! We could've screwed them.
Screw what? More cold meat...
No, thanks.
Don't you want a change of diet?
You don't give a shit.
You'd screw anything...
But I like to hear that little whimper...
That sob at the back of the throat...
Like a little strangled animal...
Watch this.
Excuse me, do you ever...
...go "Ah...aah!" on your pillow at night?
Are you crazy?
You want us to waste our time on that?
We really deserve better.
Life is too short.
No more shampoo girls!
Know what you need?
You should make it...
...with a real woman...
That's O. K. by me.
Not the snooty type.
A real winner!
She'll drive you wild...
You'll go on forever.
A starved woman...
Who really wants it...
Who hasn't been getting any...
I get it - an old bag!
I didn't say old.
How about a nun?
There are plenty who don't get any.
Nothing doing...
I've got it!
What? A new idea?
Nothing to it...
Unless I'm completely off base...
...the best one I've had yet!
Ingenious. My masterpiece...
What? Go on...
A woman...
...Iike you've never dreamed of...
Someone you know?
Not yet.
We're going to meet her. Very soon.
What do we owe?
We leaving now?
If we're going to drive 450 miles...
Where we going?
So what's your brainstorm?
A reservoir...a private game preserve.
300 women...Get the picture?
All dying for it...
One little touch and they explode...
Stick your finger in...Wow!
It's burning hot.
300 women. You out of your mind?
We're not going to make it
with an old bag...
Boy, is she ugly!
I think she's beautiful.
What do you want?
Nothing. Just to help you out...
Why?
No special reason.
We just saw you come out...
I don't want any help.
She's nuts.
We'd be too.
Who are you?
Just two friends...
Can't you leave me alone?
Especially today...
Can't you see you're bugging her?
Just go get the car.
He's got to be kidding...
Wait.
Don't be afraid. Listen...
Here...You'll catch a cold.
Where you going?
You don't even know?
No.
Have any money?
Ten dollars.
Someone to call?
No.
We'll take care of you.
I've had enough of that...
Oh, come on...
My buddy's gone for the car...
...warm and cozy...with nice,
comfortable seats.
Don't you have
a change of clothes in there?
No.
You see...
...no money, no clothes,
nowhere to go...
...doesn't look good...
What do you suggest?
Everything...
We're at your disposal.
With the car and plenty of money...
Look...
No. I don't trust you...
Can we help?
Get the hell out of here!
Why so unpleasant?
Just beat it!
Why's he pushing us?
Here.
Take it.
You can trust me now.
O. K... First things first...
What would make you happy,
right now?
Nothing special...
We can't just keep driving...
I can get out...
That's not what I meant...
I'd just like to know...
Leave her alone!
It wasn't her idea...
...you wanted her to come,
you make the plans...
Yeah...Right...
O. K... First we get her
some warm clothes.
You must be cold.
A little...and my feet hurt.
Right! So we buy all that!
We really ought to split.
I don't like this broad.
She gives me the creeps...
We are heading for trouble...
No one's keeping you. Take the car.
No.
Thank you.
Slowly.
Why?
Slowly...You should eat slowly.
Yes...You're right...
I'll stop...I'll stop.
You O. K.?
Fine.
Thank you.
For what?
For everything...for the meal.
I don't understand, but...
You're beautiful.
No...not very appetizing...
How old are you?
25.
And you?
23.
How old do you think I am?
The tide's come in...
How do you live?
Do you have a job?
He's a mechanic.
We work in a garage.
How's it going?
Not bad.
Would you want to sleep
with an old woman?
Sure...
But I don't see any old women...
Do you?
No.
Goodbye...Thank you very much.
It's my pleasure...
No...I really want to thank you.
I really enjoyed
having lunch here...Really!
You see...I just got out of prison -
I spent 1 0 years in a cold, wet cell...
...I haven't menstruated in years.
No more blood...nothing.
At first, my period was late.
They gave me aspirin at the infirmary.
Then it came later and later.
2 weeks, 3 weeks, a month...
After a while, you forget about it.
That's when it goes away completely.
Why tell me? It's not my fault.
So you understand how
lucky you are...
...to bleed every month...
...even if it makes you irritable.
It doesn't matter...the bad moods...
...painful ovaries. It's not important...
What matters is bleeding...
You understand?
Goodbye, Madame.
Gently...gently.
Gently.
I've got my period...
Just shut up for once!
It's all over...
It'll be all right...
Oh, shit!
A son or a daughter?
It's signed Jacques...
Jacques...All of them.
How old is he?
Just a kid, look...
Jacques Pirolle?
That's me.
Your mother sent us...
Isn't she out yet?
Sure...but she's abroad.
Where?
In Portugal.
That wouldn't keep her from writing...
It's been 3 months!
Why's she in Portugal?
She left with a terrific guy we know...
An agricultural engineer...
What's his name?
Loiseleux. Don't worry...
He's one in a million!
He was a technical advisor in Cuba.
Now he's up for a contract
in Sierra Leone.
Why can't he work in France?
He's got a prison record.
How much?
1 year inside and 2 on parole.
Good enough...
What kind of car you got?
American.
Let's go!
What do you do?
We've been waiting for you!
This is Marie-Ange...
She's our girl...Now she's yours too.
She's been told...It's O. K.
She's not a sexpot, but she'll do...
There's just one hitch...
Better tell you now...
She never comes.
So if she seems a bit still and quiet...
...that's just the way she is...
We've been trying for weeks...
A total washout...!
Hi.
Want some coffee?
Yes.
Aren't you hungry?
Yes...
Want some jam?
I don't know...
I think he'd like to have a look around.
Why don't you give him a tour?
We share everything here.
Go ahead...We want you to...
Try her from behind,
she's really great.
I recommend it.
The first cigarette of the day
is really the best...
Yes, indeed...
Gets the mouth into shape!
Hear that?
What?
Listen...
Pierrot!
Jean-Claude!
It happened!
It happened!
I did it! I did it!
What?
I came...!
Cut it out!
This'll cool you off!
But I did it!
What did he do to you?
Nothing special...
Normal stuff?
Of course...
He must have tricks we don't know!
Impossible!
Besides, I did everything...
What? You never do a thing!
But he couldn't move...
he was paralyzed...
Was he scared?
He sure was!
He was shaking...
He just looked at me...
He didn't dare touch me...
I undressed him or we'd still be at it...
Then suddenly...
He just went off...in my hands...
He apologized...
You don't mean...
...that made you come?
Let me finish...
So I hold him in my arms...
...and say, "Go ahead and cry.
It'll do you good."
So he starts crying...
...and making love to me...awkwardly.
Then...suddenly he goes off...
...again...just a minute later!
Lucky you!
But wait...!
It all started after the third time...
I ask if he's a virgin.
He said "Yes".
Then he starts making
love to me again...
...slowly...and kissing me.
And, this time...!
We get the picture...
No, but this time...
I mean it...No kidding.
Want some?
We wouldn't want to be any trouble...
Any little scrap'll be all right.
You have a gun?
Who said so?
The kid...
Bravo!
Not bad, this stew...
Nothing to write home about...
Interested in our gun?
Could be...
Why?
It's a work tool.
Thinking of going to work?
Somebody's got to!
We've run out of money!
An old man's nest egg...Interested?
We'll see...
My cellmate put me on to it.
Easy job...no risk...
Old people...Helpless...
We'll be the judge of that.
I don't mind going alone...
...but I need the gun to persuade them.
Well...?
I don't give a damn! You decide.
Here...Good luck!
Thanks.
I told you they'd chicken out...
Shall we go?
Oh, Pirolle...! You son of a gun!
What a surprise!
I came with two friends.
Wait! I'll open up!
Hey! I want to know what's going on...
Pirolle!
- Jean-Claude. Pierrot.
- Pleased to meet you.
You certainly picked the right time!
There's champagne...
Well, come in!
No, Jacques...You're not serious?
Better get your money out fast!
What money?
Forget the money.
Be reasonable, Jacques...
I never did you any harm...
Go get the Chaplain if you want.
Tell him another inmate tried suicide...
...and needs comforting!
Don't be stupid...
Hurry up!
Where's Jacques?
Hurry up! Get going!
Why'd he do it?
There's no telling...
I guess ex-cons just aren't all there.
Shall we hold it for you?
And now? Where to?
No idea.
If we don't know where to go...
...why not stop for a while...?
We have the time...
Stop for what?
To make love...
It's hardly the time!
All that counts is...
...putting miles between us...
...and that corpse!
Please screw me!
I've just got to...
Don't be mean!
You know she's got a hang-up.
O. K., go ahead.
But I'm not stopping!
Use the back seat.
Keep it up and we'll have an accident!
Oh, yes...
Oh, I feel it...it's coming!
Like fireworks!
Fantastic...
Watch out for the fireworks.
What's going on?
They're stealing our car.
That's what's going on...
MURDERERS OF MODEL WARDEN
Get out.
What's wrong?
You can hitchhike from here.
What did I do?
Nothing...That's just it.
But we're accomplices to a murder.
The kind of friends...
...a nice girl like you doesn't need.
You have to go.
When I just started coming?
No way!
Don't be crazy!
I feel sick just thinking of you in jail!
I can't stand it.
You're too pretty, too fragile...
...you need affection...
We won't go to jail!
Do you believe me?
I said we won't and I'm sure.
Where's my car?
I left it there with the motor running...
Piece of junk...!
Damn that bitch and
her shitty junk heap!
Stupid hard-hats...!
Really!
Nice!
Not nice!
Stupid jerk!
Come on!
At least slow down!
Think those bastards would stop?
We'll have to go back to stealing.
It's like being in the Resistance.
We just need sheepskins and berets.
What's wrong with you?
Comrades...!
What's so special about my car?
It fascinates us! Irresistibly...
This is ridiculous.
Henri, do something.
Don't be bashful.
Maybe you'd like some lunch too.
No thanks. Don't bother.
What do you want then?
It's just a stupid car problem.
You've got one. So leave us alone.
All right...all right...
Really...!
Come, children...
You won't do anything foolish?
I think they will...!
You think it's funny.
Yeah, sort of...
Jacqueline.
So what?
We'll finish our trip in their car!
Jacqueline!
Her name is Jacqueline?
Yes...What's it to you?
What does that mean?
The bikinis...
What bikinis?
The scent...
What scent?
The scent, Madame! The scent!
They are stark raving mad!
Now who's this?
- Hello.
- Hello.
We just want to trade...
...our jalopy...for your limousine!
An early model. It's a lot of fun...
...one of the first Citroens...
It could be an ancestor of your car!
You're getting a bargain...
Come on, he's too dense...
I forbid you to touch my car!
Watch out! It's hard as a rock,
and it leaves a big dent...
Especially on someone's head...
Who cares about the car...
A car is a car...
Listen, Dad, it's nice out,
we're on vacation...
...I've just been kicked out of school.
Life is wonderful!
Stupid creep.
Pathetic...
Little shit...
Dumb engineer...
You hear your sweet baby daughter?
Well, I'm not going to the seashore!
I'm fed up.
No more volleyball, shrimping,
tennis, any of that!
Please take me along!
We'll take their car. I've had it!
I'm wasting away...
I'm suffocating...
I need a breath of fresh air.
I won't be a nuisance.
We can't...It's too bad,
but we really can't...
It'd be criminal to take you...
You can't leave me here alone!
I have burned my bridges!
Take me along!
All right. Come with us...
There's $400 in Mom's bag.
That's very nice...
How old are you?
Sixteen.
You ever been screwed?
No.
Really?
It's true.
Poor little darling...
Can you imagine?
We can't let her go like that...
Thanks for everything...
What now? Where we going?
How should I know?
I'd kind of like to know.
Just out of curiosity.
He said he didn't know.
You're bugging him!
Don't worry. What can they do to us?
Put a whole in our ass?
We already got one.
We just keep driving...
...straight ahead...
...until the tank is empty?
Why not?
Aren't you happy?
Isn't this nice?
Sure...
Peaceful...
On the road...
Hanging loose...
And we'll get it up any time we want.
