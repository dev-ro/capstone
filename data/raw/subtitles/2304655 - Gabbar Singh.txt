GABBAR SINGH
Oh! Hey, open the gate fast
Come, brother
How many men were they?
Boss, they were two men
Swines!
They were two
And you three
Did you watch this movie before?
I have watched it 30 times
Now I have come for you
What did you think and come?
Did you think that
boss will be very happy?
He will give accolades
Yes?
You!
Are you watching the
movie by bunking school?
Father, I said no but
brother has brought me
You are already spoiled
Are you spoiling him too?
Get up! Come
Go
You come
Sit down
Why did you marry him?
He is beating me all the time
People look at widows
with bad intentions
You were a three year old boy
when your father passed away
He was a three month old boy
when his mother died
We were worried as
what will happen to you because...
...you didn't have a father
and he didn't have a mother
That's why we both decided
to get married because...
...of the advice given
by our relatives
We got married to give
both of you parents and...
...not for becoming wife
and husband
You will not understand
all this even if I tell you
First stop thinking about
irrelevant things...
...and concentrate on studies
How long will you take?
Hey, tell your brother to join us
He too must be having money
Hell with him!
He doesn't have any money
We both are treated
differently in the house
Whatever he does in the house is right
Whatever I do is wrong
He is hero and I am villain
That's why I like villain
I liked Gabbar Singh very much
In fact I am Gabbar Singh
Your younger son is very lucky
He will become a great person
Watch it
Hell with him!
It is not him who will become great
- it is Gabbar Singh
- Hey, what rubbish are you talking?
Astrologer is telling about brother
Will you talk like that?
- Is he an astrologer? Is he a brother?
- Hey... Hey... I will...
Don't you have respect towards elders?
Whoever is afraid,
they are dead
You have committed the mistake
- Will you frame me for that?
- Who were playing cards?
- Catch him!
- Hey! Catch him!
- Close the gate
- Come!
Don't leave me!
Catch him!
Where is he?
Have you found him?
What if he is not found?
He is not a servant to
let him go away so easily
He is a young boy
Tell me, what had happened?
He is found
in the neighbouring village
I beat him and
put him in a hostel
if he stays here then
he will get spoiled and...
...he will spoil the other one too
Do you know
what he said while going?
Hey! Today I am young
and you are grown up
That's why I am running away
I will not escape like this
in future when I am grown up
I will chase each and every person
I will chase... I will chase...
I will chase...
Boy becomes Pawan Kalyan
Few years later...
Hey! Who are you?
What do you want?
Locker is over there
Will you go there or what?
It is the money that I saved
for my daughter's marriage
Are you drinking tea in leisure
when the bank gets looted?
One person has already left
for bringing back your stolen money
I had never seen you anytime
before in this area
Which station do you belong to?
Did I come to a temple for
telling my name and lineage?
There is nothing left to know
Only settlement!
Hello! Mike testing!
Mike testing!
People of Kondaveedu and
people from market!
Your money is safe
Show your passbook
and settled the amount
Don't fear anyone
Whoever is afraid,
they are dead
Sir, you have become our god
by giving us our money back
I am not god to appear
if you do penance
One will automatically get to
see me if they commit a mistake
We thought the money
deposited in bank is lost
You brought it back like a hero
Hey! I am not a hero
I am a villain
What is it, sir?
Whenever a person
commits a mistake and...
...considers himself as a hero
then I will consider myself...
...a villain for teaching him a lesson
That's why I am a villain
So will you save us from
flies and insects too, sir?
If a fly bites you then
you take care of it
if something else bites you
then I will take care
Hey! He is neither a
villain nor a hero
He is the same skinny boy
who roamed the market when he was young
He is our Venkatratnam Naidu
- Hey, boy! How are you?
- Silence!
My name is not Venkatratnam Naidu
Then what is your name?
Hey, look at Gabbar Singh
Hyper Singh of entire India
On hearing his name
All the muscular men begin to fear
His body is covered in steel
His nerves are made of nylon strings
His character adds a new colour
to the kaki uniform
He defines power
His trashing results in swelling
His eyes spit fire
Any villain will find it
as death warning
He got these traits since birth
He is the brand for power
His style is high-end
His following is mind blowing
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
He is on the way to do something
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
It is a brand new song to sing
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
He is on the way to do something
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
It is a brand new song to sing
if anybody interferes with me...
The weather will turn hot...
Whoever gets thrashed by me
will never walk again
You can interfere with good people
You can pinch a bad person
Who will meddle with a person like me
who knows nothing?
He will not worship others
He is rough! He is tough!
He is bit eccentric
He is born like this... what to do?
Whoever is afraid,
they are dead
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
He is on the way to do something
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
It is a brand new song to sing
My face is looks classy
My punch carries lot of weight
Let it be any danger,
my guts are ready to face it
The dress on my body
is like a wind to the fire
I will break the jaw bones
and teach a lesson
Ride as if you are flying
I will come like a storm
I will strike like a bullet
His policing breaks all rules
Whoever is afraid,
they are dead
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
He is on the way to do something
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
It is a brand new song to sing
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
He is on the way to do something
Gabbar Singh! Gabbar Singh!
It is a brand new song to sing
Hey, brother-in-law
I am the producer of the movie
that you are going to make
By the way, you go urgently and
book two tickets for Bangkok
Sir, what is this?
Mud bath! Very good for health
You too take it
What, Mr Siddhappa?
What is this mud and mud bath?
Come to Bangkok
Get it done there
What a wonderful plan?
If a bank gets closed, then one has
to face police inquiry and lot of questions
We cannot do anything
if thieves burgle it then
lots of money as well as sympathy
Brother! Brother!
Plan has failed
Some guy beat us and
took the money
Lost money?
How did you lose so much of money?
Hey, Siddhappa
I am telling you right now
if there's a police inquiry against me
then I'll tell your name first
Yes, brother-in-law
He fooled us and now
he is offering prayers
Hello! Offer prayers later
First settle the matter
You don't worry
I will take care of everything
I will take care
I want customers
who fear me in the business
I don't want partners
who are frightened
Mr Bank, did you commit suicide fearing
that the bank heist will get revealed?
So what about you
Brother, the stolen money
will not be recovered if I am killed
if you spare me then
I will kill him and come to you
Everyone is making sacrifices
We are unable to tolerate it
Go underground for sometime
Go!
Nephew, policemen are
the enemies of rowdies...
...but not of politicians
Since we are entering the
politics now, so we should talk first
if they lift their head then
we should lower it
if they meddle with us
then we should finish them
- Hey, Sooridu
- Brother!
Find out who is it
Find out where he lives
Good morning, sir
Did you eat breakfast?
I had
You go and have
Oh! Again dosa (south Indian food) today?
Make it fast, mother
I am getting late
Is it necessary to go on time
for doing hooliganism too?
How many times didn't I tell
you to help father in rice mill?
Hey, where is your ring?
- Mother, it is in my pocket
- Show it
Since it is heavy inside the
pocket so I have pawned it
Pawned?
Hey! I didn't sell the pump set
from Mr Rayudu's field
His servant has sold it
Leave me!
Hey, fool! Why will you sell the pump set
when you're served everything on a platter?
Is this your deed?
- First tell them to remove the guns
- What should I do, mother?
I have got more enemies in the
house than from the entire village
Drop the guns
First of all you
don't talk to me
Wherever you worked, you would
come home once in every month
it has been three months
since this time
I came to this house
to take you to my house
Mother, I got transferred to this village
I am given quarters too
Pack your luggage
Let us go to our house
You may not need us
But he needs me at this age
I will not come
if you want then you stay here
Me? Over here?
What if someone kill me
when I am sleeping?
What if they throw me
into a well?
I should be helping others
Mother, bless me to live a long life
I am going to the station
for the first time
- Hey!
- Sir!
I am bending
for seeking blessings
- Keep an eye on the targets
- Yes, sir!
Okay, take father's blessings
Mother, tell me to consume poison
I will do that
Hey, will you talk
whatever comes in your mind?
You are not worried about the
well-being of family members
- What is this?
- Inhaler, mother
it will help you whenever
you find difficulty in breathing
Enough! Is this what you
mean by taking care?
Hey, Shah Rukh Khan
Bring the glasses
Hey, horoscope
What are the planets saying?
I should have your blessing
What is it with planets?
There is a good change in you
Keep it up
I have got a command
over horoscope
But I am not finding
any grip over his planets
I have written a love letter
inside my heart long back
I have sent it to you
long back in my dreams
What, brother?
Why are you so late?
Good morning, sir
if you are the newly arrived Cl then
I am the constable who arrived late
- By the way, my name is...
- Samba
No... no... no
Whatever it might be,
it is Samba from now
Sir, that is not the name
given to me by my parents
So did my parents give me
the name Gabbar Singh?
- Didn't I keep it?
- I see, Samba, interesting
- Hey, Samba
- Yes
if you agree then I wish to bring
tremendous changes to the police station
What is there with my consent?
We will do it
First light that cigarette
I have quit smoking
Quit? Then you are holding...
Quitting doesn't mean
to throw it away
To keep it by my side
and put it out
Gabbar Singh Station
Kondveedu
You have lot of ego
Why did you say
such a thing suddenly?
It is understood
it is clear
- Then do something, Samba
- Tell me
Call me everyday after my ego
comes to the station, I'll then come
How is it possible?
You know everything before
Is it clear?
He is not an ordinary guy
Item Raja
Oh! Horse, Jeep, Bike
- Will he use them according to the route?
- He uses them depending on the places
Sir, you thrashed the
bank goons very well
Sir, everyone is talking
about you in the market
Inky... Pinky... Ponky... Daddy had a
donkey Donkey died... Daddy cried!
What is he?
It was good that it fired that side
Had it been this side then...
Why are you sleeping at work?
I felt bit sleepy and
lipped into sleep
What is that language like
Telugu subtitles to Hindi cinema?
After being transferred to different places
my language has turned into a mess
if you sleep again at work
then I'll put a garland on your photo
Rascal! I will kill you
You don't look as
if you are inside the cell
Watching from your side,
it looks as if I am in jail
Listen, kids
No lock and lockup
Happily walk inside this police station with
your innocent smiles and kid like antics
You've to keep this police station neat
like how we keep this village
Sir, we cannot stop them if we do like this
What if someone escapes?
Not if someone escapes
He is already escaping
How beautiful he looks
while fleeing!
Young boy!
Hey, no need of pistol
Give me the gun
- Hey!
- What?
- Stop there
- Why?
The range of this gun can cover
only this much distance
I am bit eccentric
But there is a meaning to it
Escaping from this Gabbar Singh's
police station is similar to getting killed
- Hey, Gabbar Singh's army!
- Yes, sir!
- Lift the gun and shoot the target
- Yes, sir!
Sir, if the bottles shake
then we cannot shoot them
Target should remain
stiff and steady
Targets don't move
during training
But after entering the field,
criminals don't move, they run
Shoot!
- I want to meet your sir
- Sir is busy
Tell him
that Siddhappa Naidu has come
Our sir doesn't meet anyone so easily
without any appointment
Who are you to say that?
He is my fan!
Whether I say it or my fans say
both are one and the same
Understand?
Welcome to Kondaveedu
I belong to the ruling party
Youth leader of Kondaveedu
I am like a sun that gives
sunshine to this village
it is good if you remain
like this sunflower
I am this
I heard that you recovered the bank money
and then settled everyone's account
- I have come to congratulate you
- Oh!
I too have an account in it
So when will you settle my account
Your address proof is missing
I will do it
Once I find it,
I will settle it very soon
Are you having
so much of confidence,
I have got confidence
Guts and Dare
I too have them
So I am your competitor
Not just you,
nobody will compete me
Nobody can compete with me
Siddhappa, it is because
I am my own competitor
I compete with myself
You don't know my history
So, you are talking like this
I don't want to know
the history and trash
I didn't come to fight
I have come to introduce myself
But I introduce myself
only after getting into fight
You don't know about
my popularity in this area
What is it with popularity?
It is like passing cloud
if the atmosphere turns hot,
it melts down
I am like sky
Let there be lightening,
thunderstorm or heavy winds,
I will remain
the same all the time
The passing clouds that crosses me...
I care a damn for them
- How come I am a passing cloud?
- Talk with respect, you fool!
Sir... sir
Sorry, sir
Don't attend the call
Let it continue
What is your work here?
This is my world
My house and palace
This is my world
What is your work here?
It has been ten years since
the song was released
But still the power is intact
Hey, Bulli Naidu
I will not agree if you ask
for credit even today
You cannot play cards
if you don't have cash
We will introduce cash
Why do you worry?
I didn't understand
why the price of silver was increased
it is for you
- Hey, ATM
- Yes
How much will you pay for this?
Hey! Venkatesh!
Your grandmother has passed away
Her dead body is being carried away
- Go and see her for the last time
- Grandmother!
- Throw the card
- What is that? Will you not go?
The funeral precession will pass this way
I can see her then
- Enjoy, brother
- Wow! I got a life
No One life is lost there
One life is found here
God balances the world
- Police is coming!
- Hey, relatives attend functions
And police conduct raids
wherever cards are played
We have to give
everyone their gifts
- Hey, Gabbar Singh's army
- Yes, sir!
Strong ones go that side
Short ones go this side
- And those who are fit may follow me
- So we will not come, you go
Oh, god! it is okay
if my men don't fight
At least make sure
they do dieting
By the way, whom are
we going to fight?
People who are playing cards
Shoot the people who play cards
Finally get rid of this
bad habit forever
My goodness! How come the
words are coming out in such flow?
- Hey, Samba!
- Sir
- Write down
- What should I write?
Sometimes diamonds and extraordinary
things come out of my mouth
You have to write down them...
Wow! This one too is wonderful
Should I write down this too?
It is not sufficient
if you find it extraordinary
if I find it extraordinary
then you should write them
Okay, fine, by the way,
we have to raid the gamblers
- We shouldn't fire at them
- We have been conducting raids since ages
Did anyone change?
No
That's why we should fire
They will not learn any lesson
until they get shot by a bullet
Gabbar Singh has come!
Run, guys!
Stop!
One should lose
money in gambling
But it seems
lives will be lost instead
- Sister! isn't brother-in-law at home?
- Scoundrel!
Playing cards since 30 years
Went to jail for 50 times
it should be either Gabbar Singh or me
it should be decided
What is this injustice?
We will play cards
You have to conduct raids and arrest
I am asking what this firing is
Oh! A great encounter
specialist has come
I am playing cards
since 30 years
So will you take the law
in your hands for that?
What is the need to take law in hands
for such a silly matter?
If I take out this gun and fire...
Hey, what is that?
It will fire
- Don't we know that?
- It seems he is going to kill me
Hey, you might
forget to give my 30 rupees
I will come to your house
and collect
My goodness! it seems the entire
policemen of the state have come
This is injustice!
- Hey!
- Sir
- Whoever is found, trash them badly
- Okay, sir
- Where were you all these years?
- What?
- Are you married?
- No
- Then I will not leave you at any cost
- What?
I mean criminals
Will you please leave me?
I am feeling uncomfortable
- I am very comfortable
- Are you crazy?
How did you find out?
Do you too feel the same?
Leave me
I might fall down
Definitely
I have already fallen
Hey, hope you are fine
Anything... anywhere,
- it seems you are feeling shy
- I am fine
- Sir, did you find someone?
- Yes, I found
- So did you catch them?
- Tightly
- Then I'll take them and put into the jeep
- I will kill you
Oh! These rose flowers
are piercing a lot
Hey, if you listen to me then
you will get away with instalments
Otherwise if my bank officer
comes then you will lose your shop
They are dancing when
I am asking them to pay EMI's
Hey, bank
Didn't you go to duty?
I have come on duty
My mind is becoming hot
There is something else
that is hotter than it, shall I read?
Is it happy life?

Dear Samaram sir,
I went to Rajahmundry during summer
vacation to meet my elder sister
But my brother-in-law is
giving me strange looks
I am afraid that my sister's
life will get ruined
Will you please give me
a solution for this?
Because my brother-in-law's looks
are making me mad
She is addressing
Dr Samaram as dear
it means the girl is very fast
Oh! Bhagyalaxmi
- What are you doing?
- Oh! She has come
I told you to open the shop
before me and start the business
Have you sold something?
I am waiting since long time
Nothing is sold yet
Laxmi!
The newly arrived
Gabbar Singh is looking at me
Poor soul
- Maybe he has fallen in love
- Hey, Koti
One more tea
She will not fall for you
Why did you say
such a thing suddenly?
My goodness! Are you trying her?
Tell me I'll drop out
No sir! if you want then
try the girl next to her
She will fall easily
This girl is very strict
Is she a school head master
so that she has to remain strict?
She is a girl
- Brother
- Yes
Some girls fall in a week
Some girls fall in a month
Some girls fall in a year
Finally any girl has to fall for a boy
They will fall
That is nature's law
Now watch

I want a doll of bride
- Will you accept credit cards?
- If you...
- We will accept even ration card
- Oh! What is your name?
Rati... Harati
You may call me as Basanti
Why did you give this
facility only to me?
You are Gabbar Singh, isn't it?
Hey, what is your discussion
with customers?
We don't accept credit cards
Pay in cash
Here is your bride
Is it okay if there is only bride?
Bridegroom too should be there
Nice pair
They matched in quick time
Matching people and their minds
is not as easy as you do with dolls
My goodness!
You said it very well, girl
- Hey, Sambu
- Sir
Write down
No... no... not there
I will write down this one here
Then what should I write
- What is your name?
- Harati

then someone or the other...
Write down this
Be careful

Matched?

we will throw the body into the sea

- We will throw it in a gutter
Why don't you conduct
the test before shooting?
Sorry, naughty boy
Rules don't permit
I beg you if you try
then the rules will permit
- No, rules don't permit
- I beg you, sir
instead don't harass
anybody from the market
Okay 123
- Greetings, Mr Siddhappa Naidu
- Greetings
Greetings... greetings!
Greetings to all the businessmen
By the way,
why did you call us for?
It is nothing
Nephew is fed up of his business
Henceforth he wishes
to serve you
That's why I am willing to
contest for MLA seat...
...from our constituency
Politics has become a costly affair
So do we remain blind if the
operation for eyes becomes expensive?
That's why your share on the basis of
votes and notes is three crores
- Three crores?
- Our business is dull
Because of the advent of supermarkets
our business is not doing well
You please show pity
Hey! Will you give
the money or die?
- Decide fast!
- What is it? Are you threatening?
If you behave like this for asking money
then what should be our behaviour
We will not give
What will you do?
I can do anything
I can do anything
How dare you raise your voice after
coming to Siddhappa Naidu's house?
- Hey!
- Okay, sir
- Hey, Sooridu!
- Brother!
Nobody should open
their shops in the market...
...from tomorrow
until they give the money
if they do it
then I will kill you
Market is closed from tomorrow
This is Siddhappa Naidu's decree
Drink water
What is this atrocity, sir?
We are no carrying out
any atrocity
We are closing the market
in a peaceful manner
if you open the shops
in spite of our saying no then...
...we will thrash you badly
That is atrocity
There is more time left for that
Hoirabba! Hoirabba! Hoirabba!
I am the guardian of this area
I am the saviour of the poor
I am the guardian of this area
I am the saviour of the poor
I am the villain for that
for the people...
...who are indifferent
to hard work and labour
- I am the...
- Saviour
if a person is afraid of someone then
they should be afraid of Gabbar Singh
How come you close
your shops by fearing him?
- What?
- Yes
What is happening here?
Hey! Will you shut them
because of his fear?
Or will you open them
because of my fear?
Well! Well! Well!
- Hey, Sambu
- Yes
Write down
I will write but why are you
making me write all this
You have asked
a very good question
Let us compile all these points
and publish a good book
Me and my eccentricity
Yes, that is that title
Me and my eccentricity
Wow! Solid! Superb!
Well, why are you
closing the shops?
Dissatisfaction
if you are dissatisfied
then you should visit a doctor
Why did you enter the market?
It is our dissatisfaction
over high command!
Is it?
Well, we will carry out killings
if we get bored and...
...commit murders
for passing time
Will you stop us?
Or will you do something
- Hey, Samba! Write down this too
- You!
Hey, open the doors
it is Gabbar Singh here
Hey! if you are Gabbar Singh
then I am Seenu
So what?
Hey, it is not sufficient
if you merely utter dialogues
You have to stand by them
and prove it
I will show you
I will play kabaddi with you
I liked it I liked yours
sportsmanship very much
Let us play
Let us play only kabaddi
I will be on side
And all of you on other side
if you score even one point
then the entire shops will be closed
if you don't score any
then you will have it today...
My goodness... Are you ready?
Ready! Let us play, brother
I was the district champion
in my school days
Is it?
I have the habit of giving
boons before thrashing
Three guys can come this time
You are a district champion
You go
I will not go
He is not playing Kabaddi
He is playing something else
He doesn't know the rules at all
That is not Kabaddi at all
Hey! You go!
Go!
Brother, I am deaf
Sir, spare me
Brother, beat me lightly
Hey! Is this kabaddi?
Do they call it, Kabaddi?
I am out!
Sir, I am out
You only play
You are acting smart
because of the police uniform, isn't it?
That's why we are sparing you
Otherwise we will thrash you badly
This police uniform
is there to control me
if I remove it
then it will be different
Now tell me
Should I beat you by wearing uniform?
Or by removing it? What?
He beat us like this with uniform
How will he beat if he removes it?
Hey, if you come to my court
then it means attacking
if I come there
then it is your defence
Brother, our men are getting caught
by going for attack
Tell him to come here
Sweet boy! Hey!
If you have guts then come to this court
Come for the attack
Sir!
Gabbar sir, I beg you
Gabbar, sir...
Seenu Siddhappa Seenu
- Don't remember those words
- Seenu Siddhappa Seenu
Oh! Gabbar, sir
Seenu Siddhappa Seenu
Oh! Gabbar, sir I beg you
Seenu? Siddhappa Seenu?
Why did you scratch
your neck earlier?
Is it itching so badly?
Useless imitations
That day he deprived us
from the bank money
Today he deprived us
from the market money
Until I hack him into pieces,
I cannot sleep in peace
Siddhu, take either medicine or alcohol
if you are unable to sleep
What is the need
to commit murder?
This Gabbar Singh has come
to his native village
His backdrop has become his plus point
and thereby his strength has increased
That's why the time
to show my strength has come
- No, Siddhappa
- Why?
Minister is coming next week
for the inauguration of...
...Tribal Handicrafts Exhibition
to our village
We will have a word
with him and get this...
...Gabbar Singh transferred
to a different place
What is the need to use weapons
when things can be worked out on paper?
What is the need
to create an issue
when the problem
can be solved through discussion?
- Hail!
- The minister!
New model?
Light weight
if you want then you keep it
You keep quiet, nephew
Why do you use the old one?
We will send a new one
No, I just said it casually
I have got a good collection
What, Siddhappa?
How is everything?
Sir, we are facing lot of problems
because of the newly arrived Cl
Nephew is keeping quiet
because if he takes...
...any serious action
then the party will get a bad name...
...before the elections
if you can get him
transferred then...
Venkatratnam Naidu
I mean Gabbar Singh, heard about him
Siddhappa, some people
are born in affluent families
Some people are born
in reputed families
But he is born
with a great following
You will go mad
if you see his following in the market
it is not good to transfer
such a person during this time
What else?
The matter of my nephew's MLA ticket
for the upcoming election
it is difficult
High command still considers
your nephew as rowdy
By the way,
you became a youth leader recently
if you wish to become MLA
or minister so early then...
...it is something like
asking for more, isn't it?
If you can bring down your hooliganism
then you will not...
...face any problem with either
high command or Gabbar Singh
- What do you say?
- What is high command?
- What?
- Nephew!
My hooliganism has helped the party
secure four seats in last elections
Opposition is very strong
in our area
it is my hooliganism that is helping you
to move around freely over here
I worked like a dog
for the party
Don't you know
what all I can do?
Can't you do one transfer
upon my asking?
Siddhappa, any person
would keep dogs as pets...
...so that they would bark at others
Not on the owners
Any person who wishes
to make progress in politics...
...should get along with everyone
He shouldn't create
trouble for others
Party needs rowdies
for contesting elections
Not to sit with us in assembly
Come, time to inaugurate
the exhibition
Hey! He talks about
Gabbar Singh's following
I need to show him
my following
Throw footwear on him
when he begins his speech on stage
Nephew! He is a minister
Then you don't do
Hey, come! Come!
Hey, Samba
You will find many people
who show their talent...
...with hands in handicrafts exhibition
I mean purse thieves
They...
Gabbar Singh!
Why did you
run into me like that?
There are people all around
Control yourself
How? How, dear?
I am unable to do it
But I will try to the maximum
Hey... What are you doing?
- Oh! Cell phone
- I took it for you
Henceforth my mobile should ring
continuously with your calls
My inbox should be filled
with your messages
What else?
Write down the number
9988444333
What?
Fancy number...
- Oh! Fancy number?
- I am going
- Okay, you have to
- Is it necessary?
It is necessary
- Bye
- Bye
- Our manager is bit mad
- Yes, sir
Why do we need
stalls in exhibition?
Whoever wants to take loan
will come to the bank?
Hello
Who is it?
Gabbar Singh
Oh! Oh! What, dear?
What do you want?
Please give the phone
to your friend, dear
Hey, Gabbar Singh
To me
Dear, you are the first girl
whom I liked after my mother
I called you to tell the same matter
One more thing
You are looking very attractive
in the midst of so many people
it is very difficult
to do my duty
Hey, he wants
to tell you something
Whatever it is, you are liked
very much by Gabbar Singh
- Keep it up
- I know it long back
- Hey
- Call for you
- Okay, sir
- Enjoy
- You look superb!
- Superb?
When you walk in the market...
Why did you stop?
Speak
Come on
You tell me, darling
You tell me something
Hey, bank
Use your own cell
- Hail!
- Minister Pradeep Kumar!
Now I request our dear leader
Mr Pradeep Kumar to speak
Our country India
is a treasure filled with arts
I like the culture
and rituals of Kondaveedu...
...that has three states on its border
I feel very happy
for being invited
This Kondaaveedu...
Now our youth leader
Mr Siddhappa Naidu will speak
Greetings to all
Market people... Go ahead
As said by Minister Pradeep Kumar...
Hey... Hey... Stop this
What is it?
Hey, Gabbar Singh's army
Turn back!
- Yes, sir!
- Now walk
- Sit properly
- Hey... Steady
- Will you touch me?
- Hey, leave me
Hey!
Hey, what is the nuisance?
He is creating nuisance, sir
He has mixed quarter in water
Is it a big matter to mix
quarter in water?
By the way, who has caught him?
I only caught him, sir
He didn't mix it in water
He was mixing in the water tank
Okay, it is just liquor
Leave him
- What?
- Leave him
Leave him?
How easily you said it, sir
We have caught one criminal
by risking our lives
Will you tell us to leave him?
It has become common
in every industry...
...for seniors to snub juniors
Where will this society lead to, sir?
Which way?
Hey! Did he drink alone?
Or did you too drink with him
- No, sir
- Father...
- Father...
- Father?
My father
Ms Bhagyalaxmi, thank you
for coming to our studio...
...and telling such a good thing
Uncle, do you drink alcohol?
Which brand do you drink?
Okay, take these bangles
and let him go
This is common for you, isn't it?
I don't have money right now
Will you give bribe
to Gabbar Singh?
Had anyone else said this
then I would have shot them by now?
But she is a girl
What will you do to her?
First I will encounter you
Rascal!
Okay, girl! Anyways you are saying
that you will give bribe...
Hey, Gabbar Singh's army
- Turn back!
- Yes, sir!
What is happening on that side?
Law is taking its own course
The bribe that you need to give is...
With your beautiful lips...
Yes, with lips?
You have to give a short smile
Don't you want cauliflower?
You have brought shame
to the department,
I am unable to laugh now
So your father
is not coming home now
Again turn back!
Yes, sir!
Hey, whoever makes this girl laugh
will get 1000 rupees
That's it?
Okay Okay
1000 rupees plus full bottle
Full bottle?
So can I give a try?
Yes, you can
We are drunkards!
We are drunkards!
Whenever we booze
then we behave like kings in our own way
We are drunkards!
We are drunkards!
Whenever we booze
then we behave like kings in our own way
We will dance
after drinking toddy
We will jump around
after drinking hooch
We will rule the entire universe
until we get rid of the hangover
Why do you look down
upon drunkards?
Is it because
we speak truth after drinking
Once a person gets drunk then...
...he is not bothered
about the surroundings
Government cannot survive
without this alcohol
Alcohol leads to heaven
Will these drunkards ever die?
Do they die?
We are drunkards!
We are drunkards!
Whenever we booze
then we behave like kings in our own way
We will dance after drinking toddy
We will jump around
after drinking hooch
We will rule the entire universe
until we get rid of the hangover
She has laughed!
Hey, girl! Don't go like that
after giving a smile
Why are you watching?
Everyone play
their own instrument
That's it!
She is a girl
carrying looks of a gun
How can you run away
by firing at me with your smile?
She is a girl
carrying looks of a gun
How can you run away
by firing at me with your smile?
Hey, Beauty... beauty... beauty
You have ironed my mind
Strawberry! Blueberry! Blackberry!
You have mixed them all
You have set up a
French juice factory on your lips
Oh, babe! Life without you
is similar to a white paper...
...with black colour
Oh, babe! Life without you
is similar to drinking alcohol...
...without tasking pickle
She is a girl
carrying looks of a gun
How can you run away
by firing at me with your smile?
It is like sugar-coating...
it is like licking honey...
it is like squeezing grapes
and making juice...
This is how
your sweet smile looks...
it is like putting thousand dots...
it is like the milk getting boiled...
it is like celebrating
festival every day...
Something like this is happening
I swear on you
Don't kill me!
Don't kill me!
Don't pull me
into your fire like smile
Don't tear it
Don't tear it
Don't fill the dark nights
with colours
Oh, babe! Life without you
is similar to riding a bike...
...without brakes
Okay, babe! Life without you
travelling on a train...
...that has not tracks
World cup will be held
for winning a small cup
it is not a mistake
if a short world war takes place...
...for your short smile
Country has to repay
a debt of thousands of crores
Give a short smile
We can get rid of the debt
by selling it, dear
Beat it! Beat it! Beat it!
Beat the drum
hidden inside the heart
Write it... write it... write it
Write the best song
ever written on smile
Oh, babe! Life without you
is similar to rotating a top...
...without a rope
Oh, babe! Life without you
is similar to food without salt
Hey, girl!
Greetings
Hey... hey... stop
We are going to see the girl
for my marriage, isn't it?
- Yes, sir
- Of course
They why are you
dancing so dull?
Dull means...
Where is the energy?
What do you mean by energy, sir?
Hey, give me the gun
Dance!
If the energy becomes less
then you are finished
Dance!
Run!
- Hey!
- Sir!
I will go inside
and come out with good news
- You wait like good boys, okay?
- Yes, sir
it is me, girl
Gabbar Singh
You are okayed by my mother
Your father is okay for me
if you say yes
then we will enjoy
For what?
I am a man
Will you make me tell everything?
It is... about our marriage
I will not get married
Will you not marry me?
Or will you not marry at all?
I will not marry at all
Do you know about my father?
Yes, I came to know
I heard he is drinking away
your heard earned money
if I put him in jail
and thrash him in Gabbar Singh...
...after our marriage
then he will understand
And then uncle
will give up drinking and...
...change his behaviour, right?
Since I couldn't change him
so I have changed my mind
Will you not marry until he dies?
I will not marry
as long as he is alive
- Dear, it is not that...
- Please spare me
Will I not spare you?
Are you a convict
so that I can catch you with force?
You are a girl
What will I do?
I will leave by doing nothing
Did you paint this doll?
Yours is an artistic family
You paint dolls during day time
And he drinks at night
And people think
that it is a sacrifice
Society is living in an illusion
Do I need
this dress and show off?
Music... Drums... Total waste
Sir has come
Play the music, guys!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Stop it! Stop it!
Hey, give them money
and send them away
Send them away?
How did we come and how should we go
Play the music, guys!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop it!
He has lost his senses
Give them money
and send them back
Sir, you don't say
anything for sometime
Sir will say that
You carry on
Come on! Come on!
I am saying that
she rejected my love
And you are playing music?
Music? Music?
Mother! Mother!
Are you here?
Your prayers have been answered
You have joined hands
with god and made this plan
She didn't agree for marriage
Are you happy now?
She is like you
As you don't leave these two people
she too doesn't leave her father
By the way,
it is her madness
Will she find a guy like me even
if she searches the entire planet?
One day she too
will realize her mistake
And then I will say that
I have to take care of my mother
it is not possible for me
to get married as long...
...as she is alive
Anyways you are a strong lady
She will then come to know
What do you say?
Mother, I am telling you
What do you say, mother?
Mother...
Mother... Mother...
What happened, mother?
My dear son
eat one morsel and play
Just one morsel
You are my sweet boy
Why are you not eating?
You pamper him
and he beats me
No No it is not like that
Elder son is studying well
We will make him
highly educated
Younger son is not intelligent
We will give him rice mill
He only said this
Look, if you don't respect Naidu
or treat him like...
...your younger brother
then consider me dead
Mother? I will do
whatever you say
Don't speak such words again
Please
Then eat
You feed me
How come I should
feed you too?
Eat
Brother! Eat food
it has been three days
since you ate food
Brother!
Oh! What, brother?
What happened, brother?
Brother!
No, brother!
Bring the plate
- Eat
- No, brother
Eat
I don't feel
like eating now, brother
You are not eating
when I beat you with footwear...
...in front of our men
Then how will I eat
when I am beaten with footwear...
...in front of so many people
How!
Your anger!
Your anger is correct, nephew
Will he not talk if we talk to him?
Will he not get frightened
if we threaten him?
If we kill him...
Will he not die?
Banda Swamy!
After killing him,
bring only his head
That head carries more weight
Hey, do the packing
Why did the exhibition
end so quickly?
I would have made
Gabbar Singh fall for me...
...if the exhibition ran
for few more days
Keep quiet
He is already depressed on losing...
...his mother and
you are talking about love
Have tea, sir
Mother's incident
happened suddenly
She was sitting like this
When I went near her
while talking...
I got transferred to our village, thinking
that I can meet mother daily
I thought of taking mother
with me after marriage
But mother alone
understood me very well
I don't understand
what to do when mother is not there
Why do you disturb me
when I am talking about mother?
Why do you interfere?
I didn't come to interfere with you
I came to kill you
Sir, what is this?
Hey! When our enemy
comes to kill us then...
...should we kill them or die?
- We should kill them
- That is final
Hey!
Pick it up!
Pick it up and shoot
Hey!
Do policemen fear stepping
into your house?
Now a person has come
who can put his leg on your heart
Watch him
Watch properly
Hey, you shouldn't
spare a person like me...
...if you want to kill them
You shouldn't miss it
Now see
Not a single person
is left alive there
You know to send people
I know to kill them
You are doing all this because I am
interfering with your politics, isn't it?
Now I am telling you
Write down!
Even if your high command gives
you ticket, Gabbar Singh will not give
Nomination... I will not let you
file nomination from this area
I am telling you not to do
such foolish acts
Am I not talking here?
Why are you
in a hurry to die?
Keep your anger
and stupidity inside you
Let it not come out
Don't let it come out
Hey! How come
you will give me the ticket?
Why are you killing like that?
Are you eccentric?
Yes, I am bit eccentric
Bit there is a meaning to it
I will show it
and settle everyone's score
if you don't regret for interfering
with Gabbar Singh...
if you don't realize it
then they know very well what I am
Hey! Don't think it has already finished
it has begun now
IT HAS BEGUN NOW!
I have taken birth
I am experiencing it
I have seen it all
I have seen it all
I have changed
into a human being
increase the volume
I have taken birth
I am experiencing it
I have seen it all
I cannot bear this
I can no more bear this
Nephew, it's sufficient if you have anger
to cut a banana tree
But for killing Gabbar Singh,
you need to have an idea
There could be a person
who doesn't posses any strength
But there wouldn't be any person
who doesn't have any weakness
it will be there like everyone,
he too has some weakness
We should catch it
Come
Hey, Samba
- Do you want me to write down?
- Over take the vehicle
This lorry is not letting me
to do my duty
Hey! Get down!
Where is the license?
Where is the RC book?
What, sir? What happened?
Hey, are you smuggling sandalwood?
There is not a single tree around
so where will we find sandalwood
- Hey, Samba
- Sir
The face of the person
who committed murder near...
My god! Murder case?
Sir, it is better to get
involved in smuggling case
Check according to your wish
Go and check
- I like you
- Go, sir
I though yesterday it would...
Hey, Gabbar Singh
Why do you shake like that
all the time?
We are girls
We should stay in limits
Whether a leaf falls on a thorn
or a thorn falls over the leaf...
...it is the leaf
that will get pierced
Hey, it is better for the leaf
to get pierced than to get dried up
Don't go, Harati
Come
it is our lorry
Come
Coming... coming
What is it, sir?
Why did you settle down beside girls
in the name of checking?
What is the guarantee
that wood wouldn't...
...be smuggled on the way?
Let us go
I too will come with you
So you will come with the wood
while we come in jeep
What?
I mean to say...
Take care of the wood
We only didn't get any wood
Loving policeman with two wives
What, uncle?
Is she your daughter?
- Yes
- What is she studying?
She can send an email
to her husband
I should get her married
Marriage?
You are still alive, isn't it?
What, girl?
Will you get married
when your father is alive?
No, my intention is not that
You should take good care of him
You should bring him home
if he gets drunk and falls down
When all these things happen
then only marriage can take place
isn't this the trend these days?
What, girl?
She is not following the trend
Stop it, sir
Why do you make fun with us?
Sir, by the way,
are you following this trend?
I don't follow trend
I set it
Hey, Samba
Don't steal diesel money too
Put the phone down
- ls Minister inside?
- You are...
He is waiting for you, sir
Greetings, sir
Yes, come... come
What will you take? Coffee Tea
Bribe?
Will you always
crack jokes like this?
Yes, sir
I do my duty alone seriously
I came to know of it
and that's why I called you to say thanks
if you were not there that day
then I would have been hit...
...by footwear from
Siddhappa Naidu's men
But he belongs to your party, sir
He and you...
Once you enter politics
then you don't think of party
You think if the concerned person
is our man or not
We have to concentre
on Siddhappa Naidu
Sir, you just say yes
We will take the gun out...
We will place it
at a point blank range
We will press the trigger
But we don't have permission
and powers to do that
Sir, power doesn't
lie with position
it lies within us
The one who has it in them
doesn't need any permission
Sir, if people like
Siddhappa Naidu are having...
...their own way then it doesn't mean
that bad people are powerful
it implies that good people
are sitting idle
Super! it is good
I have called you
to congratulate you
You have given me
lot of energy
I feel like doing something urgently
after talking to you
Let us do
Let us do something good for people
for being in power
Oh! Touch screen?
Sir, I don't know all that except
red button and green button
Greetings
Wish you all the best
I thought of calling you yesterday
but I couldn't do
- Don't tell stories I will not believe
- I will definitely come
Please believe me
- So should I go now?
- Okay, I will wait
Who is he?
Sri
Sri means
Sridhar
We call him Sri with love
The vehicle is going
with good speed
Okay, let you be with anyone
or anywhere...
...I just want you to stay happy
I wish only for your happiness
Hey, Rangaiah
What is that song?
Sir, how do you know my name?
Will your name be Rajnala
and not Rangaiah...
...in this kind of atmosphere?
If you want then either listen
to the song or eat food
it is not possible to have
everything in life
Okay
Look, Bhagyalaxmi
if you and Sri like each other...
...then I will find
an auspicious date and...
Hey, stop He is my brother
My cousin
He is working here
in minister's office
Brother?
Did you hear, Rangaiah?
Well, will you come in lorry
for meeting brother-in-law?
It is okay if people stay apart
They should remain
closer in thoughts
We only should
make relationships
Well! Well! Well!
Samba is not present at the right time
How wonderful you said it
Rangaiah!
Sir, do you want me
to lower the volume?
Increase it
Okay
What, Mr inspector?
Why did you come here?
- There are no criminals here
- Not criminals?
I have come thinking
that my loved ones are here
I have realized that
one can go to any extent and...
...do anything for
the sake of loved ones
Let bygones be bygones
Henceforth let the three of us
stay together
You need not
work hard at this age
Father, I will take care of it
Even if you crack jokes on me,
I don't have the patience and age to laugh
I never begged anyone
for anything in my life
I am asking for the first time
Listen to me
I am not in a bad position
to listen to others and...
...eat the food given by others
- it is not that, Mr Naidu...
- Now you go, sir
Showing love suddenly...
Why don't you speak?
Will you give money
or should I drink by selling these dolls?
Father, don't create
nuisance at the shop
Come after one hour I will give
Yes... Yes... You will give
As long as you give,
he keeps drinking
This is not necessary for you
Please you don't talk in this matter
You said it well
Didn't she drink milk
with my money in her childhood?
Now I am drinking alcohol
with her money
What is wrong in it?
I have committed a mistake
by letting you go...
...from the police station that day
Please spare me
- Listen, girl I say...
- No, leave it
Don't mind
whatever I do for sometime
Okay
Don't you have shame to drink by
taking daughter's hard earned money?
Daughter? Me?
- I didn't mean it is you
- But it is me whom you beat
Any person would win
Bhagyalaxmi lottery...
...if they buy a ticket
But you got it
in the form of a child
What is this?
Dialogue over there
and action over here
You are not connecting
with the character
if you get into the skin of
the character then...
...you will not feel the pain
Is it?
Will you not get
your daughter married?
I will not do it
Yes! She is my daughter
and it is my wish
She will work
in the shop all her life
She has to give me
money for drinking
Will you do something?
I said I like you
I will take good care of you
She said she will not get married
as long as you are alive
Why is your death becoming
a hurdle for my marriage?
My goodness!
Hey, market people
This is the story taking place
behind my back
Hey, will you both get married
after my death
I am asking you whether any person
has a daughter like her
Listen... Listen...
Did my character live up
to your expectation?
Was it good?
Hey, tell me
Tell me Did I live up
to your expectation?
Hey! Tell me, friend
Greetings, brother
Come, brother
You already look like
a bridegroom
it gives ten litres
of milk every day
She is the mother of our house
My real mother is lost
Therefore why do I need this?
That's why I am selling it
First let me test it
My goodness!
It is a bull
What? Bull?
Then it is father
Give something and take it
Okay I will give you something
I have seen money with you
after many days
Clear the remaining debt
within a month
Otherwise I will come to the mill
and create nuisance
Hey, there is a big game being played
in the neighbouring village
I will clear the entire debt
if I play one game
Hey! Leave it! Will you win the game?
I heard it many times
There is no person to thrash you
That's why you became like this
Hey! Why do you talk as you wish
after taking my money?
He is Gabbar Singh's
brother, isn't it?
Yes, brother
Brother, I can never
forget your favour
- Hey, what is there with me?
- Greetings, brother
What, brother? He looks so thin
He is dominating you
How come he
manhandles you in public?
Don't we know to do it?
Are we not strong?
I mean it might lead to a fight...
Are we not there?
What, friend?
Hey! Are you creating
an issue or not?
Tell me! Tell...
Go!
What, friend?
Do you want loan?
What is it?
Hey!
Call Gabbar Singh saying
that there is a fight taking place...
...in the cattle fair
Look, sir
Look how he is beating me
for lending him money
What if he is your brother?
Look, sir
Are you complaining against me?
Now I will begin, you stop
I will beat until you say stop
- Gabbar Singh!
- Come out!
Come out? By the way,
I am coming from outside
Why did all the crooks gather
at one place?
Hey, Raghava
He named the police station
as Gabbar Singh station
Greetings, sir
Greetings, youth leader
How are you?
Watch how he beat, sir
I heard I heard
He is taking revenge
in the name of duty
Watch it, sir
I am watching
Raghava, did you hear?
Our boy didn't change at all
Even though he gets transferred
to various places...
...he is thrashing people everywhere
He is my younger brother, sir
This Siddhappa Naidu is interfering in
my family matters unnecessarily
Raghava, the person whom Gabbar Singh
beat now is his own brother
Did you come to give justice?
Or to make phone calls?
I am asking as my right
for being a public representative...
...and also on behalf of the public
Sir, suspend him
Get me money for compensation
Or else make the younger brother
beat his elder brother
That will be fine
it will be difficult
to follow so many sections
You are an elder person
You tell
Ours is a respectable family
since the beginning
He beat in front of everyone
Therefore he should say sorry
in font of everyone
Okay, Mr Naidu
it is not that...
Sir, nobody should speak
Did you hear it, mister?
Sorry? Go ahead
Sorry
What? Loudly
Sorry
Is it over?
Now leave
Raghava, our Gabbar Singh
said sorry for the first time in life
Greetings, Gabbar Singh
You start
Sorry
Didn't you say it before?
Why do you say again?
To beat you again,
Sorry
- What is this?
- Sorry
- Sorry
- Don't come forward
Come and accept few more
Don't feel happy thinking that
you escaped in your brother's matter
I will beat you
where I should beat you
Tell me if I don't make you suffer
heart attack within 24 hours
- Hey, Samba
- Yes, sir! Tell me
Write down
Finally he too is giving punches
Write down
if people like him
come to station then...
we will fall short of books
it will be scriptures
Hey, Gabbar Singh's army
Yes, sir!
Bring all the goons
of Siddhappa Naidu
Tell them that your
sir has called you for tea
if they don't come...
Tell them that I will be
coming by carrying a belt
Okay, sir
- Go!
- Follow me, guys
Hey, Samba!
Yes, sir
Lift the gun and
point it at these dogs
Here I do it, sir
Hey! Your brother has
challenged me saying...
...he will do something
within 24 hours
What is his thought?
What is his sketch?
I should know all this
We don't know anything, sir
Nowadays he is not spending time with us
He is going out with politicians, sir
You don't make me angry
if you tell me quickly
then I will buy you chocolates...
...ice-fruits and cashew nuts
How do we know, sir?
We don't know!
What did you say? What?
Sit down!
What did you say?
How do we know, sir?
We don't know I said this
No! You didn't say in this tone
How do we know, sir?
We don't know!
You said it in this tone
Tell me in that tone
How do we know, sir?
We don't know I said this
Why isn't there
anger in the face?
Where is the base in voice?
If you don't say it correctly
then your head will break...
...like watermelon
Say it correctly!
If you put the gun near brain
then how will I get base, sir
He got scared!
Hey, fatty
You got scared, isn't it?
Sir, you do nice comedy
What comedy?
Do you find this as comedy?
Like joke...
What joke?
Do you find it as joke if I put a
gun at point blank range?
Tell me! You should tell
a joke and I should laugh
Tell me the joke
Sir, I don't do comedy
I don't know jokes
You should tell a joke
and I should laugh
Tell me! Tell me!
He too got scared!
Hey, Samba! He too got scared
Why isn't anyone laughing?
Why isn't anyone laughing
when Gabbar Singh said a joke?
Laugh!
You should laugh when I tell a joke
You should laugh! Laugh!
- Sit down, sir
- That's it!
Why should we fear him?
You just say yes
I will play football
- You shut your mouth
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
What is he saying?
What is it that he wants to play?
Sir, he is new to our gang
I am telling him about the recent
kabaddi game you played
No Not that, he said...
Let us play something... Football
No. we have stopped playing
outdoor games after your coming
We are playing games
like snake and ladder...
...hopscotch and antakshari
Then let us play
Let us play antakshari
The guy on whom the
song ends should...
...disclose your brother's plan
Who is that guy?
Who is that cute little boy?
To find out the same,
play antakshari right now...
...in Gabbar Singh's studio
First let us begin it with you
Yes
Which letter, sir?
Sing a song Ra
- Ra?
- Yes
Oh, flower! Why do you need rhythms...
...when you are going to fall down?
Why do you need
colours when everything...
...is going to turn dark?
This is the night that
will never see the dawn, dear
Oh, dear! Don't sing yesterday's song
Sing with ma
I will be there for
you to support you...
...like a tree climber
I will be there for
you like moonlight at night
Oh, dear sister
I will become the mole
on your leg and repay the debt...
...for being your sibling
Oh, dear sister
I will become the mole
on your leg and repay the debt...
...for being your sibling
A
Mother, I want to see you
I want to see you and father
I should kiss father
I should sleep in your laps
Mother! Mother!
Mother, I want to see you
I want to see you and father
I should kiss father
I should sleep in your laps
Mother! Mother!
Sir, brother sings very well
in lady's voice
Is it?
Hey, keep quiet
Are you cracking jokes?
Sing
He is making joke, sir
Sing!
Song is not what you sing
when someone asks you to sing
Game is not what you play
when someone tells you to play
Song is not what you sing
when someone asks you to sing
Game is not what you play
when someone tells you to play
What you give when asked
to give is not your heart
Whether it is a flower or smile,
it will not come for you
Hey! Stop it!
What is it?
Why are you singing sad songs...
...when I am asking you
to sing songs?
Where is the enthusiasm?
Where is the energy?
Sing some energetic songs, rascals!
Sing!
Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose flower!
Rose flower! Flower
Are you the one
who blossoms every day?
Are you the most
beautiful flower?
Are you the flower
that gives fragrance?
Are you the crazy
and tempting song?
Wow! Wow!
Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose flower!
Rose flower! Flower
Are you the one
who blossoms every day?
Superb! Superb! Great job
Do you always do this?
Or are you doing it only these days?
What, Samba? What do you say?
How well he sang, dear
Nobody is able to understand us
Rose Rose Rose
What rose is it and what nuisance
Next item!

Don't beat me and scold me
My love on you will never
become less my dear beloved

Don't beat me and scold me
My love on you will never

Don't bring shame to me
in the name of love
Hey, young boy Sa for you

Listen to the music of love
I have chosen you
You too chose me
Oh, my dear! Listen to me
Listen to the music of love

Someone threw
green colour over me
Happiness has killed me

Someone threw
green colour over me
Happiness has killed me

Oh, god!
It has killed me
Oh, god!
- It has killed me
- Oh, god!
It has killed me
Hello... Hello...
Brother, it is me
Hey! Whom are you calling?
I am calling, brother
Do it, but don't talk
Sing
Whatever you speak...
Convey it through the song
Show your craziness!
Show your craziness!
Once you come
Come! Come! Come!
Ksha
Your letter is Ksha
Sir, there are no songs with ksha
There will be if you can sing
Bring it out
Oh, moon! Come
Oh, moonlight! Come
Cross the mountains and comes
Bring some gifts
Oh, moon! Come
Oh, moonlight! Come
You are caught
You have changed the moon...
Tell me what your
brother is thinking
Tell me what he wants to do
Tell me!
He is getting your lover
married to some other guy
Thanks a lot for coming
to my studio and giving us...
...your precious time
and information
Thanks a lot to all of you
I though Gabbar Singh
is very strong
Uncle, what you said is correct
He too has a weakness
Hey! Will you challenge me
saying that you will stop me...
...from contesting elections?
What is it with elections?
They come once
in every five years
But marriage happens
once in hundred years
There is still one hour
left in the time given to you
Well, you have
some calculation Right?
That's why he told you
Who is it?
Oh! Sir has come
What did you say?
I am a useless person who cannot
get his daughter married
I have found the number
one son-in-law from Kondaveedu
My son-in-law has got
35 liquor shops in this area
Hello! He is marrying
without taking any dowry
He is giving me
money in return
Anyways you have come
You and your staff sit
on one side, eat food and go
if you want then
you can even have drinks
My son-in-law has made
those arrangements too
He is the owner of 35 belt shops
By the way, you both
should drink together...
...after the marriage
He will drink in sadness
And you will drink in happiness
You don't worry at all
She is my daughter
I can stop this marriage
with my force and power
But I cannot marry you forcibly
One can sacrifice their
life for the sake of father
But they shouldn't ruin it
Is it for a father like him?
I can imagine under
what circumstances...
...you agreed for this marriage
You need not tell me anything
if you like me then
lift your head and...
...look into my eyes once
Even if he ties two knots
by then I will stop him...
...from tying the third knot
and also stop the marriage
if you don't look at me today
then I will never see you anytime
I will not show my face
Didn't I say?
She is my daughter
Guests and hosts, this
marriage will take place
it will continue
after a short break
Don't go anywhere till then
Stay tuned to Gabbar Singh
Don't change the channel
Hey, I will fire 30 bullets
by the time you tie three knots
Three knots or thirty bullets?
Decide yourself
I have got 35 wine shops
I want neither marriage
nor bullets
if I stay alive,
I can marry thirty times
Hey! What is this atrocity?
- Hey, Gabbar Singh's army
- Yes, sir!
I shouldn't hear anything other
than the priest's chanting
if anybody talks or moves then
shoot him and threw him out
Let us deal with the
consequences later
Everyone come and
bless the couple
I don't have anyone
to bless me
Dear, you stay happy
and keep me happy
if you want then take
your father's blessings
Earlier I had father
But he is not there anymore
There are still ten minutes
left from the time given by you
I don't believe in time
I believe in my timing
In your dreams...
In your dreams...
In my happiness...
In my happiness...
I am flying in the blue sky
In your shining eyes...
In your shining eyes
In your sweet smile...
In your sweet smile
I am jumping around in madness
Is it the illusion of first sight?
Or the happiness of
getting drenched
Oh, dear I have seen the madness
My heart slipped out
and went missing
Finally I found it with you
There is something
crazy about you
it has entered my body
In your dreams...
In your dreams...
In my happiness...
In my happiness...
I am flying in the blue sky
My heart is beating
like a mandolin
My body is shaking
like a spring
Oh, dear... My better half
My drape is flying
like a bird
A battle of Panipat
is taking place inside
it is for you
I swear on you
After seeing a blue-eyed
beauty like you...
My crazy mind
started whistling
it began doing somersaults
like a mad monkey
My heart slipped out
and went missing
Finally I found it with you
There is something
crazy about you
it has entered my body
There is a carnival
happening between two eyes
Some strange happiness
is playing volleyball with me
This happiness is
quite different
Cheeks wanted to
write a love letter
Otherwise shyness
wouldn't get lost
This moment... is eternal
I have found a gorgeous lady
I will not feel this drowsiness
even if I drink something
Heart has stopped playing
love games...
it is simply jumping
My heart slipped out
and went missing
Finally I found it with you
There is something
crazy about you
My dear... My dear...
Are you here?
Did you sleep well last night?
Sleep more
Wow!
What an entry you gave like
my favourite heroine Savitri
Come
What is your name?
Don't you know my name?
So without knowing my name...
Last night... All this...
Bhagyam, did you marry me
without knowing my name?
I have understood your love
That's why I married you
So what did you
understand last night?
I came to know
how much you love me
You look like a villain to me
when the entire village calls...
...you as Gabbar Singh
I am a villain
Who said I am a hero
Should I give you a pet name?
No need of pet name
it is sufficient if you kiss me
This fellow changed his
behaviour for good...
...due to Gabbar Singh's punch
My goodness!
This is Siddhappa Naidu's house
- Think once
- I won't give time to think
Does he not pay EMI's after buying
Sumos, Qualis with the loan money?
Seize all vehicles,
Why are you entering directly?
Whom do you want?
- Is Siddhappa Naidu there?
- Who?
- Siddhappa Naidu
- Siddhappa Naidu?
What is the need
to talk to kids?
What is that look?
Because of this madness
our sir got transferred...
...from market section to
houses and vehicles section
Hey, Siddhappa Naidu!
Come, Come out!
Let us decide whether
it is you or me today
Face to face
Let us face
Do you know whose
house you have come?
I know I came to the house
of a goon who skipped EMI's
Hey! By the time nephew comes...
...remove the bull's
head hanging on the door...
...and hang his head
Hey! Kill him!
One step... One step...
Think for a minute
before you take one step
if anybody dares and
comes forward then...
...everything will get cut
Heads!
Tell something before leaving
Yes
By the way, what is it due to
which you are showing these guts?
On what basis
are you doing this?
Horror for a criminal...
Terror for Crime...
One and only Gabbar...
Gabbar Singh!
Look at there
I said, sir, I have to seize
Siddhappa Naidu's vehicles I need your help
He said I am very busy
I said it's okay, my work'll be done
if I carry your cut-out
That's why I brought this
Cut out of a person is sufficient
if he has guts in him
For making all of you...
- Hey, Ekaambaram!
- Sir
Seize all the vehicles and
bring the bunch of keys
I will see who will stop
Hey, Bhagi Wife Bhagyalaxmi
Bring the belt
You are wearing the belt
Then bring the gun
it is by your side Check
Purse
Bring the purse
What? You are passing
orders continuously
it is nothing
it was my childhood wish
to see my wife doing work...
Hey, Bhagi!
Will you give something else?
It is not necessary that lips
should be closed only with hands
You always chase goons
by carrying a gun
Are you not afraid?
Afraid? Me?
Fear for Gabbar Singh?
I fear a lot
Somehow I manage
by laughing like this
You are...
Don't stop, dear
Don't stop
You should always
laugh like this
Dear, this is no my blessing
This is the wish
of this old man
Dear, even enemies
are given a chance...
...to bless the married couple
But you didn't give
this chance to your father...
it means I have died then only
I drank for forgetting my grief
I forgot my responsibilities
Greetings, dear
Stop
if you drink once in a
while then it is for happiness
if you drink on regular
basis then it is a habit
if you drink daily then
it is a disease
if you want to stay healthy
or if you want us to...
...stay happy then
you have to stay with us
Bhagyalaxmi, take him inside
- Bring his brother!
- Okay, brother
Hey! Get down!
Leave me! I beg you Leave me!
Brother! Brother! Brother!
I beg you! Leave me! Brother!
Brother! I beg you Leave me!
The day I fought for you,
you have become...
...my younger brother that day
Brother shouldn't live at feet
He should live in arms
it is an insult to me
if my brother owes money...
...to everyone from the village
How much is your debt?
Brother, it is approximately
5 to 6 lakhs
That's it?
It is interest, brother
The principal amount
will be another five
My goodness! Money?
- Is it for me?
- Take it
Well, brother! Why are you
giving so much of money to me?
- What should I do, brother?
- Public service
I do public service
I don't expect benefit
if you want to do something...
Elections are nearing
Campaign for my nephew
You go, brother
You go to assembly
Brother, you will win
with great majority...
...if my creditors
alone vote for you
Siddhappa Naidu! Hail
Move aside
Siddhappa Naidu! Hail
Always like that?
Of course
Brother, Gabbar Singh
There is no need for us
to fear anyone or...
...give respect to any
person here, sit down!
You go
it is very hot here
I should buy a skoda car urgently
What is it that
you want to buy?
I can understand that
this is not your hard earned money
Something is happening somewhere
The day I find it out
then forget the skoda car
You will not be
able to buy soda
Behave well
Did Gabbar Singh
give up his job and...
...started giving predictions?
What?
Hey! Why didn't Koti
fellow bring tea yet?
You have seen this one, isn't it?
I will show you another variety
Look at this! if you don't like it
then there are many I will show them
My god! My god!
Your house is bigger than our assembly
Okay! Then take the house
and give us your assembly
it has become a habit to
drink by making sounds...
...since my childhood
That's why you settled in politics
Nephew too has
decided to become MLA
if you convey this to
command even as comedy...
...then the work will be done
if you want then I will spend
I mean party fund
What are you both uncle
and nephew talking about?
High command doesn't
sell tickets for money
Our party doesn't
need your money
Then you?
In fact elections are nearing
Think
Wonderful!
Wow! Wonderful!
What a nice painting
Is it costly?
One crore rupees
Is that fine?
One can spend any
amount for such things
Three crores
When we want something
of our choice...
...then we shouldn't think of money
Five crores
Oh! Oh! Oh! Useless painting!
Why do I need it?
Why did you say five suddenly?
I would have taken even
if you had said four instead of five
I would have given even
14 if you asked instead of four
Determination!
Nephew is very determined
for doing public service
Very good
Will you take money with you?
Why? To hand them to the
police at the check post?
No need, I will tell you
when to send and where to send
I have to convince
many people with me
I'll take leave
Siddhappa Naidu is
giving lot of money to the...
...high command
in the name of party fund
if the money reaches
the high command then...
...he will definitely
get the ticket
I feel this is wrong
Do whatever you feel is right
Once the money reaches
the high command...
...brother will enter assembly
Brother, money will reach
the party tomorrow and...
...the lass will reach here tonight
Tonight will be a rocking night
Hey, when I am walking in the street
with flowers in my hair bun
And finger on my cheeks...
Kevvuu Kekaa!
The entire street is going crazy
When I was walking with
a vermillion in the street...
Kevvuu Kekaa!
The entire street is going crazy
The blood inside the body boils...
Date with me is similar
to eating a special meal
My age is hot
My figure is spicy
I will serve you my best
when you come to me for eating
Kevvuu Kekaa!
My goodness!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
My goodness!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
My goodness!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
My goodness! Kevvuu Kekaa!
My beauty is similar to a bank...
if you burgle it like a thief...
What if we burgle it?
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Hell with you!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
If I light your cigarette
by striking the...
...match stick against my cheek...
What if you do?
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Hell with you!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
You come and cut the ribbon
Kevvuu Kekaa!
You come and play
any number of shows
Kevvuu Kekaa!
You have seen the trailer
Now you will see the picture
Your mind will go mad
You will become insane
Kevvuu Kekaa!
My goodness!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Hell with you!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Your style is attractive
like the new silk cloths and...
...perfume bought from gulf
Kevvuu Kekaa!
They are hot like laddoos
and comfortable like a double cot bed
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Your enthusiasm is riding horses...
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Your curvaceous figure
is leaving us dead
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Nobody can compete with me
once I hold my baton
I will drink a soda and
make you scream
Kevvuu Kekaa!
Hell with you!
Kevvuu Kekaa!
My goodness!
She kissed me, Samba!
Stop it!
What do you want?
Why did you come?
Should I tell you?
I will tell you
Hey, I don't know
why you are dancing
Should I tell you why I danced?
I have seized the money
that you had sent for the party
I have transferred it to
Kondaveedu Police Welfare Association
Hey! You!
Nephew, if you agree saying
that money belongs to you...
...then you will be sent to jail
for stacking black money
Then you wouldn't be
able to file nomination
You said it correctly, uncle
if you want nomination
then you will not have money
if you want money
then you cannot file nomination
Uncle, nephew got trapped nicely
Now you will have...
Kevvu Kekaa!
Your nomination... Kevvu Kekaa!
Hey, Siddhappa
Your are now... Kevvu Kekaa!
Brother, it is raining
Let us go inside
Hey, Venkat
You are ready to die for me, isn't it?
Now get drenched for me
He hit me on money
I tolerated it
He hit me on my respect
I tolerated it
He humiliated me
I went through it
But for the first time
in many years, I am afraid
Uncle, I am afraid that I will die
without becoming MLA
Brother, just now
I received the call
Minister told Gabbar Singh
about our money
Oh, rain! Did you remember me now?
For how long
will you hide in the sky?
You come like a relative
You meet me and go
if you say that
you will stay with me...
...then will I not
make you mine?
If he is getting drenched
in happiness then...
...it means that someone
is going to die
- Whose house is it, sir?
- Minister's house
Tell the ministers
to forget all the fights and...
...ask him to forgive me
Tell him that I will think
that he has forgiven me...
...if he accepts this small gift
Okay, brother
You watch it
I will make everything fine
What is the need for me to go
Why don't you send
some guy from your gang?
He is getting irritated
on seeing our men
He is not giving entry too
Will I get entry?
Say that you are
Gabbar Singh's brother
They will send you
Your brother is of no use to you
At least use his name
for these works
Okay
Nephew, why did you send him?
I would have gone
and settled the matter
I have sent him
to settle the matter
I have kept a bomb in that mobile
Nephew!
I have to go to hospital
I will return in half an hour
You have become mad
Do you know
what you are saying?
If you do this kind of
stupid things before the election...
...then you will never enter
the assembly all your life
One step...
Minister and Gabbar Singh
on both sides
That step is going
to change my life
My constituency...
Sir, he is Gabbar Singh's brother
Come
What?
Siddhappa Naidu has sent this for you
Well, he has sent a costly phone
Tell him that I will not fall
for such cheap tricks
What is your relationship with him?
I thought your brother
has sent you
Okay! Tell him that
I accepted the sweet box...
...and rejected the gift
Didn't he take the gift?
Did he take only the sweet box?
Where are you?
Nephew, minister didn't
take the cell phone
What, nephew?
Didn't you say that I am a rowdy?
I have started playing politics
I didn't keep the bomb
inside the cell phone
Then?
Get inside
Come, brother
it is your brother
He went inside
after telling your name
People who came before him
were the regular volunteers
They didn't bring anything
The visitors who came
later too have...
I have received orders
from high authority...
...to suspend you and take action
Since I know you
so I am just suspending you
You will join your duty
as soon as you catch your brother
Leave it!
Move aside!
Sir, were you already
aware of the bomb blast?
Your intelligence
and police group has failed...
...on various fronts
What is your comment on it?
We heard that
you are an angry person
Did something go wrong
between you and him?
How many politicians
will you kill like this, sir?
Tell me, sir
Tell me
Tell me your answer, sir
it is sufficient if you have a mike
and channels for you to speak
I need witness
and proof to speak
You spoiled him saying
he is born under a lucky star
Now watch
He is going to be hanged
Your son has started
doing wrongs things...
...that began from
taking debts for gambling
Now he has planted
a bomb in minister's house...
...after joining hands
with Siddhappa Naidu
He has done all this
by using my name
I got suspended
because of it
Even if government spares him
Gabbar Singh will not spare him
I will shoot him!
It is only me who will conduct
your funeral rites
Forget him!
Hey! All these days
you were flying high
Now you have fallen down
Will you stop me
from filing nomination?
Now I have removed your job
I will get your job back
after I win
Do you know why?
To salute me
it will take some time
for these things to take place
Therefore run behind
my convoy and shout...
Hail! Siddhappa Naidu!
I will get you biryani
and alcohol every day
What? What?
Should I thrash you in uniform
or by removing it?
Crosses! Punches!
Now you don't have
uniform to thrash
if you want uniform
then you will not have your brother
if you want brother
then you will not have uniform
He is caught now
He is not a Gabbar Singh now
He is rubber Singh
What was that?
Bubuchki!
Doctor, how is Mr Naidu?
It is a massive heart attack
We cannot say anything
before 24 hours
Now tell me
it is a mild attack, sir
You can take him home
within 24 hours
- Can I see him?
- You can stay there, sir
Are you Mr Naidu's heart?
He says he wouldn't talk to me
At least you listen to me
Why did you become so weak?
See how strong my heart is
Why don't you learn
from other hearts?
I lost my father in childhood
Did anything happen here?
Nothing happened
After that my mother
married Mr Naidu
Did something happen
to me at that time?
Nothing happened
Recently my mother passed away
Did something happen
to me at that time?
It happened
How can you become like this
before I get over the grief, Mr Naidu
Should I tell you
why you didn't like me since childhood?
Because I live on my terms
Truly speaking
you too are like that
You too live on your own terms
Now too you live like that
But live, Mr Naidu
You live, Mr Naidu
What, uncle?
Why did he kill the minister like that?
I didn't kill him
You have killed
He thinks like that
But many people from the village
think that he killed him
Especially Gabbar Singh
Uncle, will Gabbar Singh
let him live?
He thrashed him badly
when he beat his creditor
So will he keep quiet
if he kills him favourite minister
He will get him hanged
Or shoot him
Because of you Gabbar Singh
lost his uniform
Gabbar Singh might survive
without breathing
But he can't live
without wearing uniform...
What if he was to live...
His brother should die
What are you saying?
Yes, you should kill him
before he kills you
Should I kill Gabbar Singh?
Don't you want to live?
Take it
Uncle, he is filled with fear
Do you think
that work will happen?
Siddha, lot of works in this world
are carried out in fear
You don't worry at all
Why did you stop? Shoot
it is because of me
you have become like this
You have killed the minister
Who am I to you?
Uncle
Why will I kill you, father?
So did you come to kill him?
Your father would have died long back
due to heart attack
Your brother is taking care of me
Hey, elder son
He will not let you live in peace
Kill him before he commits
another mistake
Don't think of anything
I am telling you
Kill him!
Brother, I don't know anything
I didn't kill the minister
it was Siddhappa Naidu
Brother, I have got bad habits
but not that of killing people
What will I get
if I kill the minister?
Believe me
I beg you, brother
Believe me
Siddhappa Naidu didn't believe
that you will kill me
That's why he has sent him
So how will I believe you?
At least now do as I say
Brother, I will do as you say
I will do as you say
Hey, call Peddi Reddy and tell him
to arrange 100 vehicles for nomination
Gather thousands of people
The rally should look great
High command should know what I am
Nephew Sooridu has died
Both brothers have become one
if he opens his mouth
in front of the magistrate...
...you will get non-bailable warrant
and not nomination
Your political career
will get nipped in the budding stage
Brother, I am feeling frightened
There is no need to fear
when you didn't do anything wrong
Tell the entire truth to IG
Hey, Peddi Reddy
Tell me, brother
Gabbar Singh and his brother
shouldn't cross the village border
He should be hacked to pieces
Okay, brother
Trample him with our vehicles
Brother!
Brother, Siddhappa Naidu
I will tell you good news
Asthma didn't kill your mother
it is my anger
Hey! Are you listening?
We killed your mother
by showing her hell
Why isn't there any reaction?
Is she not your mother?
I thought Gabbar Singh
didn't have father
Even his mother is not his own
if you don't come here
immediately...
Accept that she is your mother
Come!
Killing him is justifiable
His death is inevitable
Will you die for him?
Or will you save yourselves
after his death?
Decide it
Decide it!
Brother, what about us?
I will see
that all of you get police job
Brother, will rules agree?
If Gabbar Singh accepts
then all the rules will fade away
Hey, come
Gabbar Singh Parade Grounds
Gabbar Singh's army
of rowdies-turned policemen
Lift the gun and shoot the target
Greetings, sir
What is this, sir?
If target remains at one place
then it will be difficult
We can have fun only if it moves
Sir, they are all mad
But there is no meaning
it is okay
A person might be eccentric,
furious, foolish and arrogant
But the point is that
whether he is moving ahead...
...or going back for having
these qualities
What?
We cannot manage
with these guns,
Give us knives
We will finish the target
Oh! Khaki and knifes
don't match
Just imagine
Public will fear you
By the way, police is not someone
who instils fear in public?
Policeman is someone
who removes the fear from public
Wow! Wow! Wow!
Hey, Samba! Write down
Sir, book is completed
So he went to give it for printing
Oh! How many things did I say?
Dear, if a son is born to us then
we will name him Jabbar Singh
- What do you say?
- No! We will have a daughter
it will be your mother
Oh! You have tickled my heart
Mother, come fast
Let us fight
I have prepared your favourite dishes
Fish curry
Lemon rice, Leafy vegetable curry
Rice flour papad
You are killing me
Didn't you bring chilly?
