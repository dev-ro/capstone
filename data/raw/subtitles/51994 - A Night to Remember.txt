I name this ship Titanic.
May God bless her...
...and all who sail in her.
Hip, hip!
Hooray!
Listen to this, Sylvia.
"The new White Star liner, RMS Titanic,
is the largest in the world. "
"And in the luxury of her appointments
Titanic takes first place...
...among the big steamers of the world. "
"With Vinolia Otto Toilet Soap for first-
class passengers, Titanic also leads...
...with a higher standard of toilet luxury
and comfort at sea. "
Let me see.
For the first-class passengers, mark you.
The rest don't wash, of course.
- Excuse me, sir, but are you a foreigner?
- Eh?
Or a radical, perhaps?
I ask because my wife and I
find your sneering remarks in bad taste.
What?
Let those who wish to belittle
their country do so in private.
Every Britisher is proud
of the unsinkable Titanic.
I'm sure my husband would agree. He
joins the Titanic as her Second Officer.
- I, er... I apologize.
- A misunderstanding, of course.
Of course, madam.
Soap is no laughing matter.
- It was the suggestion of criticism.
- Of the advertisement, not the ship.
Quite so.
You're joining her at Liverpool, I take it?
No, sir, Belfast.
Then we sail to Southampton.
How I envy you! The newspapers say
she's a veritable floating city.
Symbol of man's final victory
over nature and the elements.
- 800 cases shelled walnuts: Titanic.
- Yes.
- 3,000 dozen fresh eggs: Titanic.
- Yes.
- It's all Titanic, this.
- All Titanic.
- 255 pound jars Beluga caviar.
- Yes.
2,000 pounds of jam, greengage.
Definitely not the veal. But we'll take
the rest, subject to inspection.
Goodbye.
The final passenger list, sir.
- How many first class?
- 332, sir.
276 second.
708 steerage.
- Total with crew?
- 2,208, sir.
More than half the steerage join
at Cherbourg and Queenstown.
There we are. Eight wardrobe trunks.
10 suitcases. 18 pieces in all.
They're ready.
- All ready, sir.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, sir.
- I hope you have a pleasant journey.
- Thank you very much.
- Are you sure you're warm enough?
- Yes, thank you.
All right, Perkins.
Now, children, here they come.
Show Sir Richard and Her Ladyship
how much we respect them.
Hooray...!
Hooray...!
Hooray...!
Hooray...!
Hooray...!
- Who are they?
- The workhouse kids.
Making sure of their Christmas turkey
from the home farm.
Goodbye, darling! Goodbye!
You won't forget to write, will you?
- We'll send you a wireless from the ship.
- Oh, do take care of my little one!
Bye, Mary!
- Well, God speed to you, child.
- Thank you, Father.
You'll all come back
when your fortunes are made.
We will that, Father.
- What about the horse and cart?
- I'll sell them in Queenstown.
Get a good price, Tom.
They're sharp in Queenstown.
Don't worry, Father. I'll watch me step.
Don't grieve, Mrs. Farrell.
It's a wise thing your husband is doing.
- Can I help you up, miss?
- Thank you.
That's very kind of you.
Wait for me!
Will they promote you to First Officer?
Depends whether they keep old Wilde on.
- You were First on the Majestic.
- That was temporary.
- Don't you mind?
- No.
Murdoch's the one with his nose
out of joint. Ambitious fellow is Bill.
So are you. You know you are.
I'd rather be Second in the Titanic
than First in any other ship.
It's the honor of serving the company,
and to hell with the pay!
Language!
- What would you like from New York?
- Nothing you couldn't buy cheaper here.
But there is! Garters!
Ladies' silk garters with big frilly bows!
Just in from Paris! Blue ones, pink ones...
...scarlet!
The idea of you buying garters
with big frilly bows on them!
The idea of you wearing 'em!
Ooh-hoo! Ooh-la-la!
Now, Bertie, look at the time. It's late...
...and you have to get down to the ship.
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Pilot.
- Quite a send-off, eh, Captain?
- Yes, sir.
There should be quite a welcome
waiting for us in New York, too.
A proud moment for you, Mr. Chairman.
And for you, Andrews. You built her.
You're the one...
...who ought to take the bows.
I'm only the office boy.
We should arrive, er... let's see...
Wednesday morning.
- Not out for a fast run, are you?
- No, nothing like that.
Naturally, Captain,
you'll use your own judgment.
I'm just an ordinary passenger
on this trip.
Mr. Murdoch...
Let me know when the gangway's landed.
Aye aye, sir.
- See? Steady as a rock.
- That's remarkable!
The sea's dead calm at the moment.
All the same, Captain, dead calm or not,
lots of other ships would be rolling.
That's perfectly true.
As you say, sir, she's as steady as a rock.
Someone must have jogged the table!
So sorry!
- Got any more sugar there?
- Yes, sir.
- What is it?
- More ice warnings, sir.
One from the America
and another from the Baltic.
Mm.
Mm, just south of Cape Race.
Never known pack ice
come that far south before, sir.
Been a mild winter up in the Arctic.
This ice must be drifting down
on the Labrador current.
Well, our passengers aren't in any hurry.
Wouldn't be with us if they were.
- Messages for the Captain.
- Oh, very good, Sparks.
- See he gets them right away.
- Certainly.
Excuse me, sir.
From the wireless room.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Ice warnings from steamers ahead of us.
Excuse me.
Serious?
Oh, we shall keep a sharp look out.
Hear it?
That's the Titanic.
What's she saying?
"Best wishes to Joe and Hattie.
See you Wednesday. Love, Mina and Bill. "
Private stuff.
Must be a lot of money in that ship.
They've been at it all day.
Float ice.
"Buy 200,000 rand. "
"Market price. Opening Monday. "
- This chap's spending a fortune.
- What have you got there, Sparks?
Titanic on her maiden voyage, sir.
She's working Cape Race.
How far away is she?
Hard to tell. Signal strength's pretty good.
About 50 miles back, I should think.
Get this off to all ships, will you?
"From SS Californian. Ice reports... "
Jak on ladnie spiewal.
Siedz spokojnie.
Enough of that!
Give us something livelier.
Give us a jig now, Aloysius!
- Would you care to dance?
- Co pan m√≤wi?
- Dance?
- Czy moge zatanczyc?
- Nie bedziesz tanczyc z nieznajomym.
- Oh, it is only a dance! Come on now!
Good evening, milady. Sir Richard.
Good evening.
Leadville Johnny they call him.
And he was the best god-durn
gold-miner in Colorado.
- 15, I was, when I married him.
- Really?
Mm-hm. And he didn't have a cent.
Well, three months later he struck it rich
and we was millionaires.
- You know what he did?
- No.
He built me a house.
And he had silver dollars cemented
to the floors of every room!
How very tiresome for you!
- Evening, sir.
- Evening, Kemish.
- Any troubles?
- No, sir, she's a beautiful job!
- Thank you, Hesketh.
- Goodnight, sir.
I've sent off as much as I could, John, but
the Purser's office kept sending up more.
Here he is again.
- Good evening.
- Sorry, Mr. Phillips.
"From the Titanic at sea. "
"Wish you were here. "
Blimey!
- Well, how's Cape Race working?
- A lot of repeats. Not too bad.
There was an ice report
from the Californian.
All right.
No peace for the wicked, eh?
Come in.
- What, more?
- Afraid so.
Put them down there, will you?
- Having trouble, Sparks?
- Certainly not.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
- Keep on course, QM.
- Aye aye, sir.
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Chippy, the temperature's dropping.
We don't want frozen water tanks,
so keep an eye on them.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Thank you.
It's jolly cold.
Are you warm enough, darling?
Let's go back. We ought not to be here,
anyway. This is first class.
They're welcome to it on a night like this.
Come on.
- Evening, Mr. Lightoller.
- Good evening, sir.
- Any more ice reports?
- No, sir.
- What's the temperature like?
- Almost freezing, sir, and still dropping.
In an hour or so
we'll be in the Labrador current.
The weather looks clear enough so far.
If there's any haze,
we shall have to slow down.
- Let me know at once if you're doubtful.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Mr. Moody.
- Sir?
Tell the lookouts to keep their eyes
skinned for small ice and growlers.
- Make sure they understand.
- Aye aye, sir.
Tell 'em to pass it on
when they're relieved.
Ice ahead, sir!
Aye aye!
- Stop engines.
- Stop engines.
Stop engines, sir.
That's field ice, Mr. Groves.
I'm not trying to find my way
around that until daylight.
- Shall we report it, sir?
- Yes.
- Work out our position.
- Aye aye, sir.
- Evans, what other ships are there near?
- Only the Titanic, sir.
Tell her we're stopped on account of ice.
- Mr. Groves will give you our position.
- Aye aye, sir.
Order from the bridge.
Special watch for small ice and growlers.
Right-ho.
I say! You won't drink
all the cocoa down there, will you!
I told Chippy to keep his eye
on the fresh water.
And the lookouts
have been warned about the ice.
- That's about it. I'm off on the rounds.
- Thanks, Lights.
You're welcome to it. Goodnight.
- Here...!
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry, sir.
- Hallo, Blake.
Pop my coat in my cabin for me,
will you, please?
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
Brandies for the gentlemen
and hock and seltzer for the ladies.
- Is that correct, sir?
- That's right.
Look here. You're sure about
this full-speed trial tomorrow?
That's what I heard, sir.
- I can't guarantee it, naturally.
- Here's somebody who could tell us.
- Hey, Lieutenant.
- Sir?
Good evening, ladies.
- Have a drink.
- No, thank you, sir. I'm on duty.
We're running a sweep on the ship's run.
Rumor has it the Captain's
gonna see how fast she can go.
- It's possible.
- Ah-ha!
What would be your guess
about the run, Lieutenant?
- Oh, I ought not tell you that, sir.
- Why not?
Well, wouldn't you feel worried
about betting on a certainty?
- Are you sure you won't have a drink?
- A little later, if I may. Please excuse me.
'Ere, lad, we're tryin' to find our bunks.
You can't come this way,
it's second class.
Oh, sorry! No offence, lad.
Down to the end, then left.
- Good evening, sir.
- Everything all right?
- Yes, sir.
- Good.
- Can I do anything, sir?
- No, thank you.
- Winning a lot, is he?
- Pardon?
You know the one I mean.
- Yes, sir, he is.
- Thought I'd seen him before.
- Majestic, I think it was.
- Name of Rogers, sir.
Oh? It was Yates last time.
- Can they afford to lose?
- Wealthy gentlemen, sir.
If you get a chance, drop them a hint.
We don't want complaints of that sort.
Gets the ship a bad name. And you, too.
- Goodnight, Steward.
- Goodnight, sir.
I said I'll see you.
Flush.
Here's our position,
as near as I can work it out.
The old man said he gave you
the rest of the message.
That's right.
What's the matter? What's he saying?
He says keep out.
Now he's calling Cape Race again.
- What's he sending to Cape Race?
- More private stuff.
Some big bug wants his private
railway car to meet him in New York.
How about that!
Well, it's time I signed off
and got a bit of shuteye.
When I get off Watch,
I'd like to listen in a bit. All right?
- Beginning to get the code, are you?
- One word in three.
Have to make you Second Operator.
- Then you can wind up the detector.
- I'll take you up on that.
- Hallo, Doc!
- Hallo, Lights.
- Somebody ill?
- I'm on an errand of mercy.
- Hope she's not too young for you!
- You've got an evil mind!
Come in.
Hallo, Doc. What can I do for you?
Stop working on this grand ship of yours
and have a nightcap.
I've got one here.
This is sound medical advice
I'm giving you.
Come in.
What is this?
"Restaurant galley hot press
not working. "
"Alterations needed to the writing room. "
"Too few screws
on the State Room coat hooks. "
This ship of yours must be falling to bits!
I like to have things just so.
People first, things second.
- Your very good health, Mr. Andrews.
- Good health.
Come on, get on with it!
Aye!
Mm.
Yes?
There's a big ship coming up
to starboard, sir.
- How far away is she?
- Maybe 10 miles, sir.
Better find out who she is, I suppose.
- Contact her with the Morse lamp.
- Right, sir.
- What did you see?
- Iceberg dead ahead, sir!
Iceberg dead ahead, sir.
- Hard to starboard.
- Hard to starboard, sir.
- Full astern both.
- Full astern both, sir.
- Close watertight doors.
- Close watertight doors, sir.
Hard to starboard it is, sir.
Up the ladders, boys!
Come on, up top!
- What is it?
- Iceberg, sir.
I put her hard to starboard and reversed
the engines, but... she was too close.
- Stop engines.
- Stop engines.
I splashed my drink!
Steward!
- Yes, I saw it. Huge thing.
- Good Lord!
- Can't see it now. Must've shaved past it.
- How's this for a souvenir!
It's off the berg!
There's tons of it up for'ard!
Steward, bring me a whisky and soda!
We've run aground, I tell you!
We've run aground on Newfoundland!
What're you talkin' about?
Shut the dampers
and get the fires doused!
I tell you she's thrown a propeller blade.
It happened in the old Majestic.
We'll be going back to Belfast - you see.
They've got the pumps working.
Get a gang down here and draw the fires.
You heard! Come on, me lucky lads!
All right, lads, come on, down again.
I dunno...!
It's my birthday today as well!
Well, if there's nothing to see,
I'm going back to bed. Goodnight.
- What's the trouble?
- Nothing serious. Soon be on our way.
Yes?
Why have we stopped?
A bit of trouble, sir. Would you please
join the Captain on the bridge?
- Now?
- If you please, sir.
She's making water fast, sir.
- Aren't the pumps working?
- Yes, sir. But the engine room need more.
- This is most unfortunate, Captain.
- Yes, sir.
- Is the ship seriously damaged?
- I'm afraid she is. Excuse me.
How long is this likely to delay us?
We struck a berg.
I think she's badly damaged.
I'd like to know how badly.
All right. I'll go down and have a look.
Oh, glory be!
Come on!
Oh, now, if we're going to play a game,
we'll play it properly.
Oh, well played, sir!
I say, let's go down and join the fun!
But they're steerage passengers!
Anything more you want to see?
No.
Chief, I'd get those men up
as soon as you can.
Yes, I'll... I'll do that, Mr. Andrews.
What have we stopped for?
Talk of an iceberg, ma'am. I expect we've
stopped so as not to run over anything.
What's up?
We're stopped and blowing off steam.
Something's wrong.
Bumped a bit of ice, I think.
I can't sleep with this racket.
Shall I give you a hand?
I've finished the Cape Race traffic.
Help with the accounts, if you like.
I'll get some clothes on.
- Will we have to turn back?
- Oh, don't say it!
If we do,
we won't get a moment's peace in here.
Here's the position.
Water in the forepeak.
Numbers one and two holds.
The mail room,
and boiler rooms six and five.
That means a gash 300 foot long.
From there...
...to there, below the waterline.
- Do you agree?
- Yes. Well?
They're keeping the water down here, but
the first five compartments are flooding.
Well, what's the answer?
She's going to sink, Captain.
But she can't sink.
- She's unsinkable.
- She can't float.
She could float with any three of her
five watertight compartments flooded.
She could even float with four of them
gone. But not all five.
These watertight bulkheads
only go as high as E deck.
The water in the bow will pull her down.
So you get the fifth compartment...
...overflowing into the sixth,
the sixth into the seventh, and so on.
It's a mathematical certainty. With that
amount of damage she can't stay afloat.
- How long will she last?
- I'm just trying to work that out.
She made 14 feet of water in the first
10 minutes after the collision.
Not very fast.
She should live... another hour and a half.
Yes, about that, I think.
There must be no panic.
No.
You'll be careful what you say
to the passengers?
Of course.
How many people are there on board?
2200 or more.
And room in the boats for...
...how many?
1200.
I don't think the Board of Trade
regulations visualized this situation.
Do you?
Gentlemen,
we are in a precarious position.
We must be prepared to abandon ship.
Mr. Murdoch,
you will muster the passengers.
Mr. Lightoller, have the boats
uncovered and swung out.
Mr. Boxhall, get all hands to boat stations.
Mr. Moody, help Mr. Lightoller. Mr. Wilde
and Mr. Pitman will remain on the bridge.
Everything will be done quietly
and calmly. No alarm and no panic.
I will give the word when the boats
are to be loaded with the...
...women and children.
Carry on, please.
Captain!
Aren't you exaggerating the danger?
- I'm afraid not, sir.
- Where's Andrews?
I'm acting on his advice.
This ship is going to founder.
But she can't!
In any case,
we can't get everyone in the boats.
I know that, sir.
Please God it won't come to that.
Now listen to me.
The ship has been seriously damaged...
...and the Captain's ordered the boats
swung out. It's got to be done quickly...
It's got to be done quickly and efficiently.
We don't want any panic.
If you keep your heads,
the passengers will keep theirs.
You've had no boat drill, but
you're all seamen and you've got brains.
Now's the time to use 'em.
- All right, Bosun?
- Yes, sir.
Get busy.
The ship is badly damaged.
Send out the call for assistance.
- The distress call, sir?
- Yes, and at once.
As soon as you're in touch
with the nearest ship...
...tell them to come as quickly as they can.
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
- That's our position.
- Yes, sir.
What about that steamer over there?
Who is she?
I don't know. I suppose she's in the ice,
too. She stopped at about seven bells.
I called her with the Morse lamp
but she didn't take any notice.
Well, me for bed.
Right.
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, sir.
Any luck?
Frankfurt, 150 miles away.
Olympic says the Mount Temple's nearer.
Well, there must be someone nearer still.
Try sending SOS. That's the new call.
It may be the only chance
you'll ever have.
Come in.
- Sorry to disturb you, sir.
- What is it?
Everyone's to put on warm clothing,
get their lifebelts on, and go up on deck.
- What?
- It's only a precaution, ma'am.
Excuse me, sir.
Everybody up! Get dressed!
Get your lifebelts on at once!
Everybody up! Get dressed!
Get your lifebelts on at once!
I said you get dressed, get lifebelt, quick.
Savvy? Chop chop.
Chop chop?
Goodyard! 'Ere!
Get your lifebelt and get dressed!
Get your lifebelt...!
Come on, hurry it up,
you've had time enough.
Don't fold those covers!
Mr. Lightoller...
- What's in that sack?
- Bread, sir.
- Right, chuck it in the boat.
- Very good, sir.
Every boat must be manned by seamen!
That's laid down!
Everything's in hand, sir.
Please go down to the lounge.
Come on, ship those turning handles!
Woda?
Woda!
Ludzie, Ludzie! Woda w kabinie!
Janek, Janek!
Patrz, co sie dzieje! Co za porzadki!
- Get up, we're sinking!
- Get out of it!
- Oh, pipe down.
- Everybody up!
- Captain's orders!
- Why don't you put the light out?
Hooligans!
Stewardess...
Why aren't you wearing your lifebelt?
- Passengers mustn't think I'm scared.
- Let them see you wearing it.
Put it on, child. For your own sake, too.
Oh, madam, let me help. Come along.
Really, it's too tiresome of them!
Everybody knows this ship can't sink!
Ah, there you are.
And me sleeping sound for the first time
since we left Queenstown!
Where's Pat off to?
Hold me bag, will you?
Cor!
Get up top! Quick!
They say they always grow up
to look like their mothers.
The older one's keener,
if you know what I mean.
Yes... I know what you mean.
Why don't you give them both
a miss this trip?
- And take the mother out?
- You might do worse, by the sound of it.
You're heating my blood.
I think I'll turn in.
- Sweet dreams.
- Goodnight, Sparks.
Mr. Dean! Sir! There's a distress call
from the Titanic! They've struck a berg!
- Is this a leg-pull?
- No, they're sinking!
- The Titanic? Don't be a fool.
- It's true! I'm going to the Captain.
- There's nothing in sight. Take over.
- Aye aye, sir.
Sir! Sir!
What the devil...?
Haven't you learned to knock!
A distress call, sir, from the Titanic!
She's sinking!
I'm sorry, sir, I...
Mr. Dean, turn the ship round.
Head north-west.
- I'll work the course out in a minute.
- Aye aye, sir.
- You're sure it's the Titanic?
- Yes, sir.
- Certain?
- Absolutely.
All right, check back. Tell them
we're coming as fast as possible.
Yes, sir.
Sir...
We've contacted the Carpathia.
She's on her way to us.
- How far away is she?
- 58 miles. Should reach us in four hours.
- Four hours.
- Yes, sir.
What about that ship over there?
You can see a light.
- Isn't she replying?
- No, sir.
She'd blast our ears off if she did.
Maybe she can't keep a 24-hour watch.
Maybe she hasn't got a wireless at all, sir.
All right, Bride. Thank you.
- Mr. Moody.
- Sir?
Tell Mr. Boxhall to fire the distress
rockets. One every five minutes.
Aye aye, sir.
Port-side boats all swung out, sir.
Shall I fill them?
Yes.
Put the women and children in
and lower away.
Aye aye, sir.
- Looked like a rocket, sir.
- Yes...
I wonder what a ship like that
would want to fire a rocket for?
Right, then, number 22.
One, two.
Step aboard. I'll pass the children across.
- What about my husband?
- Women and children first.
- Yes, my dear, you better had.
- In a small boat like that?!
That lady's right!
It's absolutely ridiculous!
- Help me out of here, please.
- It can't be helped if she won't go.
Now, madam, please.
- Would you step into the boat, madam?
- And catch my death of cold?
Certainly not!
- Would you step into the boat, madam?
- Thank you.
Eileen! Eileen!
Yes?
You won't get back on board
without a pass!
- But I don't see...
- I have my orders, ladies and gentlemen.
The ladies are safer here
than in those little boats!
- The Captain's opinion is different, sir.
- Look here, sir.
I don't know whether you've noticed,
but this ship has quite a list on her now.
- That's not right.
- I don't suppose that's very serious.
You can't sink this boat, that's certain.
Get a move on.
Come on, lads.
Come on, move along there.
What's the use? All the pumps in Belfast
would never keep that water down.
That may be so. But the longer we can
keep her afloat, the more lives we'll save.
- Sorry, sir.
- Sorry.
Martin, there's a job for you.
- Not going up top, sir?
- Presently. Open the spare cabins...
...take out the lifebelts and blankets
and get your men to distribute them.
- I'll see to it at once.
- Good.
- Oh, Mr. Andrews.
- Yes?
I'd like you to tell me something. I...
I have a wife and three children on board.
Just how serious is it?
I'm not the panicking kind.
The ship has about an hour to live. A little
more if some of the bulkheads hold...
...but not much more.
Get your wife and children into the boats.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Andrews.
I take it you and I may both be
in the same boat later.
Yes... we may.
This way, please. Quickly.
Straight down there.
Please tell me what's going on, Robert.
People have been rushing about...
It's very tiresome.
We've struck an iceberg. We may be
a day late getting to New York.
Oh, that is annoying.
And, to make matters worse, the
Captain's being very fussy and correct.
All women and children
have to get into lifeboats.
- Oh, no!
- Afraid so.
But I don't want to wake the children.
- Is it really necessary?
- Yes.
I think we should do
what the Captain says.
Very well, Robert.
We must wrap the children up warmly.
And take the blankets off the beds, too.
- I'll deal with Tom. You see to the girls.
- All right.
Tom... Tom, come on, old boy.
You've got to get up now. Sorry.
There's a good boy.
Come on! Come on!
Up! Quick! Out of it!
The bulkhead's going!
Get to your boats, please.
- It's a safety precaution, madam.
- I refuse to wear it.
- You must wear a life jacket.
- But I dislike it intensely.
Try it on, sister! Everyone's wearing 'em
this season. They're the latest thing!
Steward, cancel my appointment with
the hairdresser. Tell her I've gone boating!
- Really, I'd rather not wear it.
- Come along, ladies.
Will you let me have them, please!
A big one. That's mine.
Too many people...
Purser, I must have my jewels. They're
in the safe. I've a receipt here to prove it.
- The women and children need the boats!
- You can't go through here!
This is not the way
to the steerage boat deck!
They'll open the lower decks
when the orders are given.
Oh, will they! We'll soon see about that.
- I'll have to shut down more steam.
- I'll get rid of some of the load, then.
You can cut the boiler-room fans
for a start.
- That'll help.
- Good.
How are things up top, sir?
Any chance for us?
We've got to keep the lights going.
I'll say when it's time to go,
then it's every man for himself.
But it won't be so bad. They say
the Carpathia's on her way to us.
Should be here any time now.
Well, let's hope they're right, eh, boys?
Er, if any of you feel like praying,
you'd better go ahead.
The rest can join me in a cup of tea.
Cut heating and hot water. Cut anything.
I need every ounce of steam I can get.
Aye aye, sir.
Mr. Dean, get all hands on deck.
Prepare to receive survivors.
Knock off all routine work.
Get your boats ready and swung out.
Rig electric lights down the side
of the ship. Open all gangway doors.
Hook a rope in every gangway door.
Get canvas slings ready for the injured.
See that all side ladders are down.
- Have you got that?
- Aye aye, sir.
Quartermaster, telephone the doctor and
Chief Steward. Ask them to see me now.
Aye aye, sir.
No, she can't get on, she'll swamp it!
- There isn't room!
- Mummy!
You must let her on! It's Mummy!
You must come on!
- Let her on!
- All right.
You can have my place.
- Thank you very much.
- Joe, you take the helm.
Right, darling.
Stand by to lower!
Aren't you in charge of this boat?
I'm no seaman, sir.
Joe can manage just as well.
Ladies first, eh, sir?
Lower away together!
Quickly! Come along, you men!
- Quickly!
- Hold it!
- What the...
- Will you kindly not interfere, sir!
We've got to get these boats away!
Do you want me to drown everybody?
That's what will happen if I lower
the boats too quickly. Now stand back!
Carry on lowering!
There'll be trouble about that
when we get to New York.
What's the matter with him? Is he blind?
- That's six rockets she's fired, sir.
- Yes... Maybe I'd better tell the Captain.
What is it?
That big steamer, sir, she's firing rockets.
Six up to now.
Perhaps they're company signals.
Call her with the Morse lamp and ask her.
Aye aye, sir.
The Captain thinks she must be signaling
to another ship about the ice.
- Looks a bit queer.
- I'll try signaling again.
It's as if she's listing.
That's because of the angle she's at to us.
If you please, madam.
- My friend is in that other boat.
- Madam, you must get in.
- But I don't see why...
- You cannot pick and choose your boat.
Gangway, please! Gangway!
- I want to go back to bed, Daddy.
- You're going for a ride in a boat, old son.
They tell us to go up, then tell us to come
down. I wish they'd make up their minds.
Very sorry, ma'am.
- This indecision is most bewildering.
- Yes, ma'am.
Really!
If there's no danger, why do you want us
to put our lifebelts on? Tell me that, man.
I'm not here to argue!
I want everybody with their lifebelts on!
Pat and I have found a way up.
- Where is Pat?
- He's gone ahead.
It may be someone trying to signal,
but I can't make it out.
Could be a masthead light flickering, sir.
If I had a gun, I'd put a shell into them.
This way, madam. Quickly as you can.
Straight to the end, please.
This way, madam. That's right.
The water's up to E deck.
There's not much time left.
If they won't get in, chuck 'em in.
This way, madam.
Thank you.
As quickly as you can.
Right down to the end, please.
Please don't put me in the boat!
I'd rather die, I tell you!
I've never been in an open boat in my life!
I can't do it!
You've got to go, madam,
so you may as well keep quiet.
Off we go, then.
Good boy, Michael.
Through here now.
No steerage up 'ere!
This is second class!
- Good God, man, let the ladies pass!
- I shall lose me job!
You'll lose your teeth if you don't shut up!
Come on, quick,
before he fetches someone.
Which way to the boats?
Any way you like, friend.
Any way you like.
All roads lead to Rome.
This way, Pat.
- No! No!
- Come along, madam.
- No, I won't! I won't!
- Women and children first, madam.
Please, Lottie, be brave and go!
I'll get a place in another boat!
Lottie, please!
- Robert, I can't go through with it.
- We shall have to forgo the drive...
- I can't leave you.
- Henry won't mind us being one day late.
- But he'll draw the line at two.
- I'm not going, Robert.
My dear, I never expected
to ask you to obey me...
...but this is one time you must.
It's only a matter of form for you
and the children to go first.
Everyone here will be quite safe.
Is that the truth?
Certainly it is.
If you please, madam.
The children will follow.
Now you be good girls
and look after your mother.
Yes.
There we are. Hup!
Goodbye, my dear son.
Come on, son.
Thank you.
- Keep everybody clear of the boat!
- Aye aye, sir.
Stand back!
Come on, everybody! Stand back!
Stand back, sir. We're going to lower.
Right, lower away together!
Watch your hands, ladies.
Keep them well inside the boat.
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Daddy!
- Let's follow somebody, Pat.
- And get chucked out?
No, no, let's try this way. Come on.
First class!
Come on, Pat.
I don't care, Mary. I don't like
the look of it. We're going up.
Just a minute!
You'll be told when to go up!
Right, eighteen...
Lower away together!
Hold it!
Please...
There's room in the boat...
Women and children only!
Miss Russell!
I thought you'd gone to the boat.
My pig. I must have my lucky pig.
Well, er...
Uh... I've had enough.
We can settle later, if you like.
Yeah, yeah. Later.
Maybe he's got an appointment.
Maybe he's right.
I don't know much about ships,
but maybe we're in a tight corner.
Then what shall we play now, gentlemen?
Happy Families?
Well, Phillips?
The Carpathia's making 17 knots
and should be with us about 3.30.
That'll be too late.
There may be someone nearer.
Keep trying.
Yes, sir.
- I've got you a lifebelt, John.
- Put it down there, will you?
- Don't they see us?
- No, sir.
There was a light flashing, but it
must have come from their masthead.
- Quartermaster Rowe.
- Sir?
- Can you send and read Morse?
- Yes, sir.
Then signal "We are the Titanic, sinking.
Please have your boats ready. "
Aye aye, sir.
- You go along and help with the boats.
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Boxhall.
- Sir?
Ask Mr. Wilde where the arms
and ammunition are kept.
- They may be needed later.
- Yes, sir.
We've done it, Michael!
No! No! I don't want to go!
I want to stay with you!
No!
No!
No...!
Come along, ladies!
There's no time to lose!
You heard what he said.
The same with you now.
Moje dziecko, idz! Moje dziecko, idz!
Your boat full, Mr. Lowe?
- Some ladies here for the boat, sir.
- Come along, then. Quickly, ladies!
Hurry! Come along, please.
Go along with you now.
Watch your step.
Make room for them in the boat.
Watch your step.
But surely they'll let us take just one bag.
No, dear. No bag.
But there's my trousseau.
Everything we have is here.
Not quite everything.
Say, we only got one sailor with us.
That's not enough to manage this boat.
Hold it there!
Fast lowering!
- What's the matter!
- We only got one sailor on this boat!
Are there any spare hands here?
I'll go... if you like.
- Are you a sailor?
- I'm a yachtsman.
If you can nip down that, you can go.
Below! Let's have that line!
Right. Good luck.
Lower away!
Women and children to the boats!
Women and children first!
- Rachael, get in the boat.
- Mrs. Straus, you must.
I've always stayed with my husband,
Colonel. Why should I leave him now?
Please, be sensible.
We have been living together for
many years, Isodor. Where you go, I go.
Nobody would object to an old gentleman
like Mr. Straus going in a boat.
- I'll ask the officer.
- No. I will not go before the other men.
We stay.
Come, my dear.
She's right, you see.
We'll stay together, too.
But she's old. You're young.
Please, darling...
I can look after myself.
We both can.
Watch your step.
Wait a minute!
- He can't go. Women and children only.
- Of course he can go. He's only 13.
All right, son, go on.
You can look after your mother.
Keep back, ladies and gentlemen!
Keep back!
It's absurd!
On the other side, the gentlemen
are going in the boats with their ladies.
- Why we're standing here, I don't know.
- But...
Will there be room
in the boats for everybody?
Course there will.
- Oughtn't we to ask?
- Somebody said we had to wait here.
- Perhaps we ought to go up top.
- Sir!
Please, sir, where are we to go?
Put those cigarettes out!
Don't you know the rules?
I'll have you on the Captain's report!
Gangway!
Come on, you two, out of it! Come on!
Please, let me stay in the boat!
All officers must report
to the Chief Officer's cabin, sir.
No men are allowed in these boats
until all the women have gone!
Mr. Guggenheim, hurry.
I'll see your valet knows where you are.
This thing's uncomfortable. It hurts.
- You should really be up top, sir.
- My valet. Send for my valet.
- May I go, too?
- Yes, sir, in you go.
- Room for me?
- Yes, get in.
Evening, ma'am.
I... I guess this is the best place to be.
Open the gate!
Open the gate! Let us through!
'Ere, what are you up to?
I'll have you arrested
for damaging company property!
Lads, leave it now
and try and save yourselves!
- Still no answer?
- Not yet, sir.
- You'd better fire the rest of the rockets.
- Aye aye, sir.
Come along, please, ladies. Quickly now.
Come, my dear. It's time for you to go.
Goodbye.
God bless you.
Take care of yourself. And Jeanie.
Seamen to man this boat!
That's us, mates!
Off turns for lowering.
Lower away.
There's only 12 in there. It should take 40.
Why not put some people in them?
Come on, mate.
- Women and children up top!
- All right. Women and children up top!
Women and children only up top!
Look! Look! All the boats are gone!
There's only four!
There must be more!
- Quartermaster...
- Stand back, sir.
That's the last one, sir.
No reply to your signals?
No, sir. The baskets must be asleep.
Report to Mr. Murdoch. He's short-handed.
Aye aye, sir.
God help you!
Now come along! Don't hang about!
This way, ladies!
It's only for a short while!
Your men will be all right!
Captain told me to report to you, sir!
Take charge of this boat.
Watch yourself or she'll swamp.
Stand aside!
Madam, please... If I don't get through,
will you send this to my sister?
- The address is on it.
- Come along, please.
Don't forget...
Just a minute, sir.
Bit pessimistic, aren't you?
The sea's freezing.
A man won't last long in that.
We've drawn a bad hand this time.
I've never been a good loser.
I intend to get into a boat.
Then I wish you luck.
All right, that's all!
No more room in this boat!
No more space in this boat!
- Where do we go?!
- Where do we go, then!
- Up there!
- Up the other end!
Off turns for lowering!
- You ready there?
- Sir!
- Is there... no-one else?
- Lower away!
Fast lowering!
Lower away.
Well, Phillips?
Nothing fresh, sir.
Carpathia's coming as fast as she can.
The Olympic asked if we were
steaming south to meet her.
The Frankfurt keeps asking for details.
They don't seem to understand, sir!
It can't be easy for them.
The engine room's flooding.
You won't have power much longer.
- Tell the Carpathia.
- Yes, sir.
- Tell her to hurry.
- Yes, sir.
I've got blankets piled at every gangway,
and we're preparing dormitories.
We'll have to regroup
the steerage passengers.
All right.
Just a minute. Our own passengers
will have to keep to their cabins.
It'll be difficult enough as it is.
Put stewards in every alleyway.
And tell them...
- What is it, Cottam?
- From the Titanic, sir.
She's sinking by the head.
The wireless operator won't have
the power to transmit much longer.
Her Captain wants to know
how long we'll be.
Tell them another two hours.
Keep back!
Ten ladies! That's all!
Ten more ladies! Ladies only! Ten ladies!
That's all! No more in this boat!
Come on! Try down the other end!
Don't panic! Hold on to yourselves!
Get back! Come on, get back!
Don't panic!
Take charge of yourselves! Don't panic!
Come on! Get back!
Mr. Lowe, take charge of this boat.
Start lowering!
Aagh...!
Here you are, sister. You take this.
It'll keep you warm.
- No, please...
- Don't worry about me. I got plenty of fat.
Keep pulling.
The officer said to stand by
close to the ship.
Then we'll be caught by the suction.
You row with me.
One of the ladies can steer.
I'm in charge of this boat.
Your job's to row.
Some of the ladies can help row, too.
Can't we, girls?
Sure! It'll keep us warm!
Well, I...
Button up, skipper.
You want rowers? Okay, you got 'em!
Hurry along. Thank you.
Sorry, only one more lady.
You go first.
You've children waiting at home.
- No...
- Hurry along. We haven't much time.
Still here, Miss Evans?
We'll get you off in the next boat.
Thank you.
She's going fast now.
- Are all the boats away?
- All except the two collapsibles.
There's no time to get them off the davits.
We'll float them off as she goes down.
I'll need some hands
to get them unlashed.
Hey, you two! Follow me!
Any spare hands there?
Get that shoring timber!
Two men to each one!
- Right, Jim?
- Yep.
What's the use? No-one's listening.
People don't listen at dinner, but we play
just the same. Isn't that so, sir?
- They say it helps the digestion.
- Exactly. Because it soothes the nerves.
Right, number 24.
- Mr. Guggenheim, your lifebelt...
- It was uncomfortable.
We have dressed now in our best and
are prepared to go down like gentlemen.
That is so, sir.
If anything should happen to me, I would
like my wife to know I behaved decently.
We'll try and break her outboard.
The crew are trying to clear
two of the collapsible boats.
If they succeed, I'm sure
there'll be a place for you, madam.
You see, you can still go. Please, darling.
No.
We started out together
and we'll finish together.
Are you married, Mr. Andrews?
Yes.
And if my wife were here...
...I think she'd do as I asked.
But you have a family?
Mm-hm.
That would make a difference,
wouldn't it?
Perhaps.
Let me give you both some advice.
Don't stay on the ship until the end.
Put your lifebelts on and lower yourselves
down into the water by the ropes.
Don't jump if you can avoid it.
Swim away from the ship at once.
The boats will stay well clear
when she sinks.
Thank you. We'll remember.
And, er... I should wear something white.
So they can see you.
I wonder if he'll save himself.
We'll save ourselves.
Now ease forward!
All together!
Keep the strain on those check-lines!
Everybody out!
Come on, lads! Out!
Everybody up top!
Power's going, John.
It's time to go now, Phillips. You've
done your duty. You can do no more.
Abandon your cabin,
it's everyone for himself.
Look after yourselves now.
I release you both.
God bless you.
John!
John!
It's no use, John. The power's gone.
Hey, you!
Live and let live, sir! Live and let live!
John! John!
John!
Put your weight into it!
Right.
Hold on to your check-lines!
Keep her square on!
Keep going, Michael!
Hold on to those check-lines.
Hold on to those check-lines!
Leave it, there's no time!
Try and free the starboard collapsible!
Hurry!
Abandon ship!
Every man for himself!
Mummy, where are you! Mummy!
Aagh!
Come on! Quickly! This way!
It's the end, boys.
We've done our duty.
We can go now.
Look out!
Help! Here, come back! Help me!
Get out of it! Get out of the way!
Get out of it!
Oh, save me! Save me!
Keep together!
Clear the ship's side!
Help! Help!
Swim for the upturned boat!
Aren't you going to try for it,
Mr. Andrews?
- Hello! What are you doing here?
- I want my mummy.
We'd better go and find her, hadn't we?
You come with me.
- Michael, I can't make it!
- Come on, Mr. Farrell!
Come on, Mr. Farrell.
Here you are, Mr. Farrell. Come on.
Make for the rear now.
Keep together, all of you!
Clear the ship's side!
Swim clear! Keep clear!
Keep off this child!
Keep off this child!
Get off my legs!
Get off! Get off!
Aagh...!
She's going.
Swim clear! Keep clear!
Look! Oh, look!
Aagh!
A prayer. We ought to say a prayer.
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done...
Oh, God!
...the power and the glory,
for ever and ever
Amen.
We'll find Mummy. We'll find her.
What the hell are we waiting for?!
Those people are drowning!
This boat isn't full!
We could save some of 'em!
Are you mad?! They'll swamp the boat!
- They'll capsize us!
- We can't just sit here and do nothin'!
- Come on, girls! Row!
- I give the orders around here!
- That's a lady you're speaking to!
- I know who I'm speaking to!
Get fresh with me, son,
and I'll throw you overboard!
Come on! Row!
Now look here!
You'll drown the lot of us!
This boat's returning to pick up survivors.
I'll pass some of our passengers to you.
- We've got no room in 'ere, sir.
- Rubbish! You've room for 20 more!
Now do as you're told.
Excuse me. Mind your backs.
- Madam, would you...
- I absolutely refuse!
- I'm awfully sorry about this.
- I've had quite enough!
Well forward, please.
- I still say we ought to turn back!
- We'd get swamped!
You heard what he said.
We ought to try, I reckon!
What do you think, sir?
We're crowded enough as it is.
I'm feeling most unwell.
It's difficult to say.
Only one of us is a seaman.
I think we ought to take his advice.
Well, perhaps if we wait a bit, until things
are quietened down, and then...
- Well, then we can try.
- Wait until they're half dead, you mean!
That won't take long in this cold.
That big steamer that was out there, sir.
The one that was firing rockets.
- What about it?
- She seems to have gone now, sir.
Yes?
That steamer, sir. The one firing rockets.
She seems to have gone.
- And she didn't fire any more rockets?
- No, sir.
Very well. What's the time?
2.45, sir.
- All right, enter it in the log.
- Aye aye, sir.
Get off! Get away from this boat!
There's no more room!
You'll capsize us!
Get off! Stay away from here!
Get away! There's no more room!
Get off!
Stay off!
Stay away! She'll capsize, I tell you!
All right, take it easy!
Get off, then!
Get off!
Get away!
Good luck.
God bless you.
Come back!
No! Come on back!
There! Throw him off!
All right, men, pull yourselves together!
Pull yourselves together
and control yourselves!
- We'll sink!
- This boat's not sinking yet!
But it will if we don't get organized!
- It's every man for himself!
- Do as the officer says!
- Hear, hear!
- That you, Sparks?
Yes, sir.
- How long will the Carpathia be?
- An hour or so, sir.
Right. There's a bit of a swell getting up.
Listen to me, all of you!
Wait a minute.
Come on, lads. You're all right now.
- Give a hand, Sparks.
- Aye aye, sir.
Take care of the child.
Here.
Straighten up!
Steady!
Left! Lean left!
To your right! Lean right!
Steady!
- There's one back here dead, sir.
- Are you certain?
- We are, sir.
- Yes, sir.
Right. Lower him over the side.
Lean left! Lean left! Gently!
Gently.
- Can the baker come aboard now, sir?
- Yes! Pull him in!
Lean right!
Lean right!
Steady!
Thank you, sir.
I beg your pardon, sir. The cold...
Look, sir. Look ahead, sir!
Right, steady, lads. Steady.
To your right!
To your right, to your right!
That's an officer's whistle. Make way
together, lads. Starboard helm.
Er, to your right, please, madam.
My baby!
My baby!
That man over there
is smoking a cigarette.
It's disgraceful! People really
ought to control themselves.
I want my husband!
I'm so cold! Please, I'm so cold!
I'm so cold!
We should be there by now, sir.
Not a sign of her.
Must've given the wrong position.
Iceberg on the port bow, sir.
- Starboard a point.
- Starboard one point, sir.
- Slow ahead.
- Slow ahead, sir.
Starboard one point.
There's a flare ahead, sir.
Fire a rocket.
- I tell you we're done.
- Ah, shut up!
No water, no food.
- Got no compass, no chart.
- That's the North Star, isn't it?
- What use is that? We're miles from land.
- What was that?
A falling star? Flash of lightning...
Lightning, my foot!
That was a rocket! Look!
Pat, there's a ship sending up a rocket!
Sit down, please, ladies. Sit down.
You may lose your balance.
We'll give them an answer.
There!
They'll see this!
Look, boyo! There's a ship coming!
She's firing rockets!
Let me be...
Ah, come on now, brace up!
It'll not be much longer.
Oh, look at them rockets!
Look at them lovely rockets!
Will that be the Carpathia?
Aren't you glad to see her?
Yes, I'm glad. But then I'm still alive.
If only she'd been nearer.
There are quite a lot of ifs,
aren't there, Colonel?
Quartermaster, keep that line slack!
If we'd been steaming
a few knots slower...
...or sighted that berg a few seconds
earlier, we might not have struck.
If we'd carried more lifeboats, instead
of just enough to meet regulations...
...things would have been different again,
wouldn't they?
Maybe. But you have nothing
to reproach yourself with.
You've done all any man could, and more.
You're not...
I was going to say you're not God,
Mr. Lightoller.
No seaman ever thinks he is.
I've been at sea since I was a boy.
I've even been shipwrecked before.
I know what the sea can do.
But this is different.
- Because we hit an iceberg?
- No.
Because we were so sure.
Because, even though it's happened,
it's still unbelievable.
I don't think I'll ever feel sure again.
About anything.
Almighty God...
...Father of all mercies...
...we, thine unworthy servants...
...do give Thee most humble
and hearty thanks...
...for all Thy goodness and
loving kindness to us and to all men.
Particularly to those who desire now...
...to offer up their praises
and thanksgivings...
...for Thy late services
vouchsafed unto them.
We bless Thee for our creation...
...preservation...
...and all the blessings of this life...
...but, above all...
...for Thine inestimable love
and redemption of the world...
...by our Lord Jesus Christ...
...for the means of grace
and for the hope of glory.
And we beseech Thee...
...give us that due sense
of all Thy mercies...
...that our hearts
may be unfeignedly thankful...
...and that we shew forth Thy praise,
not only with our lips...
...but in our lives...
...by giving up ourselves to Thy service...
...and by walking before Thee
in holiness and righteousness...
...all our days...
...through Jesus Christ our Lord...
...to whom with Thee and the Holy Ghost...
...be all honor and glory...
...world without end.
Amen.
Amen.
Sir?
We're at the place now.
I thought you'd like to see for yourself.
Yes. Thank you, sir.
We only found one body. The rest
must have been carried on by the current.
We'll go on searching for survivors
until we turn back to New York.
- How many...?
- The purser's got the figures now.
We have on board 705 survivors.
Several of those in the boats
were dead, I'm afraid.
- 1500 lost?
