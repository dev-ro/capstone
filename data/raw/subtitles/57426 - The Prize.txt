Time: The Future Place: Stockholm
I wonder if everything will go well this time.
Each year, I worry.
Each year, everything has gone well.
When will I stop worrying?
Soon enough, I suppose.
The only advantage of being 79...
Once again the Swedish Academy of Science has voted.
The Royal Karoline Institute has voted.
The Swedis Academy of Letters has voted.
Once again, man bestows immortality

Dr. Garret is one of three
awards given to US citizens.
The others are the physicist Dr.
Stratman and novelist Andrew Craig.
The winners will arrive in Stockholm shortly before the
ceremonies and stay at the Grand Hotel, which is the custom
- Enough !. Shut up once! Must I remind you again?
- During the Nobel Week,
only English is spoken here.
.. but..
- even when you quarrel.
- But this year it's my
turn to deliver the trays. Last year it was his.
Gentlemen please! You will both deliver the trays.
- both?
- One to carry...the other to assist.
- I will carry...no I will.
- You will alternate on each delivery. Now
don't let me hear another word about this...
...especially in Swedish.
- Which is first, medicine,
literature, chemistry, physics...?
- The way I feel, I am in the mood for Medicine.
- The way you sound, you should be in the mood for Physics.
- The Nobel prize for medicine is equally divided
between Dr. John Garett, of the USA
and Dr. Carlo Farelli, of Italy.
- Here, Mr. and Mrs. Garrett with
their children... Suite 447.
- Let's go...assistant.
- Mrs. Garrett ? - Yes.
- With the best wishes of the Management. - Oh isn't that nice.
- Well can't you ask someone at the hospital for Dr.
Ohmann's private number?
- Right over there on that table ..
- I mean it's not in the book, he must live in a suburb.
- Can I have some?
- Me too, I want this banana.
I want this.. - Be quiet, shhh. 
- Your father... Now get your hands off Annie, David.
- Please, please. Here!
- No, thank you. Goodnight.
- Goodnight, thank you.
- No I am not ill, but it's important
that I speak to Dr. Ohlman
- Why not?
- Because you've already had dinner
- Come to think of it I am getting ill.
I'm going to hang up. Goodbye.
- I should never have left California.
- Won't tomorrow be time enough? You're exhausted.
- I wanted to have the evidence on
Farelli before the press conference
- Are you so sure there is evidence?
- What's a Farelli, mommy?
- Stupid, he's the man who stole
half of daddy's Nobel prize.
- Aren't they supposed to be in bed?
- Yes, yes, come on, now move, bed.
- Farelli is a smelly, Farelli is a smelly,
- Come on, come on.
- Who is there, a man or a woman?
- The waiter here, sir.
- Dr. Farelli?
- In the flesh, as you can see
- Compliments of the Grand Hotel.
- Oh, magnifico. Come in, come in.
- Over there next to my mother please
so she can stuff herself without moving
- Madame Farelli
- Goodnight.
- Thank you a thousand times. Goodbye.
- Just what I needed.
- I suggest you watch my performance with
our Nobel prize winners in chemistry
Dr. Claude Marceau
- and Dr. Denise Marceau.
There is much to be learned by observing me.
- I agree, you should
be placed under observation.
- Good evening Doctor.
- I did not order anything.
- A gift of the management. For you and your esteemed wife.
- Good evening, Madame doctor
- Thank you. And the same to you.
- Do you have one of those for the young lady in the next room?
...my secretary.
- Miss Subié?
- Yes Dr., not only the Laureates but their guests
receive every hospitality of the management
- Perhaps you would like to enclose a card, suitably inscribed.
- Thank you. Goodnight.
- Denise!..., must you  in front of them?
- If we are going to go through with this charade,
let's at least have a few laughs along the way.
- Did I know we were going to win the Nobel prize?
The least we can offer in return is a few days of dignity...
- Dignity? It's disgraceful, it's positively immoral
you and I living together in the same room this way.
- We are husband and wife, aren't we?
- Yes, but what will "SHE" think?
- Come in "Cherie", the door is open.
- Who's that for, me? Who loves me so much?
- The Grand Hotel Miss Subier.
- Oh, not you?
- For the Grand Hotel. Put it right there.
- Is the champagne cold?
- Perfect, shall I open?
- No, no, too soon, too soon.
- "Merci Beacoup" gentlemen,
- And you will leave the door
un tutti peu ?, like so, yes?
- Good night. - Good nght.
- He did say Secretary, didn't he?
- Something must have been lost in the translation.
- Oh?
- Good evening.
- Miss Stratman? - Yes
- For Dr. Stratman and you
from the management of the Grand Hotel.
- How kind of you. I'll
take it, my uncle is resting.
- Are you sure you can handle it?
- If I drop it, I'll call you
and we'll pick up the pieces together.
- Very well, Good night Miss Stratman.
- Good night and thank you.
- I thought it was those people
to take you out to the nightclub.
- Mr. and Mrs. Berg aren't due for an hour.
- And what are you doing out of bed?
- Can you imagine putting my old body
in this beautiful thing?
- It's an insult to the tailor.
- Emily, when the King shakes my hand
Couldn't I just be wearing a sweater?
- No. And if you don't lie down, Uncle Max
I'm not going to let you go out tonight
On that secret rendezvous of yours
- Secret nothing...just
ashamed of old friends
- Oh, if only you weren't going out!
- Well... what have we got here?
- Schnaps?
- Oh, you'll crush it
- Oh on purpose to keep myself from admitting I can't wait
to wear it to the Concert Hall
- Well, good stuff
worthy of the double occasion
 seeing you for the first time
as a grownup woman, and then this
this wonderful foolishness of your
old uncle being called to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize
like he were someone important.
- You're supposed to be resting
- Enough rest!
- If I do not take some Schnaps quick I
might wake up and the whole thing will turn out to be a dream.
- It's no dream, Uncle Max.
[In Swedish]- No, no, no way...
wait a moment
- This is the suite of the Nobel prizewinner for literature, 
Mr. Andrew Craig, is it not?
- Yes it is, set it down over there, please.
[in Swedish]- Mr. Craig does not like to
be asked unpleasant questions
- Don't go yet... we'll talk later
- You will have to remove the bottles. - Remove them?
- Champagne, beer, acquavit, out.
- But then Mr. Craig will
have nothing to drink!
- Exactly. And now please
do as I say.
- Begging your pardon, Miss, but WHO says?
- Ms. Andersen of the
Foreign Office says.
- In thirty minutes Mr. Craig
will be landing at the airport
and here we are, playing games. Catch!
- There he is!.
- You fly a very nice glider, Miss Munson.
- Thanks, Mr. Craig
- You also mix a very civilized Martini.
- Perhaps one too many for such a short flight.
- Never deny a man his
right to be unconscious.
- I'm afraid they're waiting for you.
- Yes, I'm afraid so too.
- Goodbye Miss Munson.
- Goodbye, Mr. Craig.
- Watching you walk up and down that aisle tonight
I feel as though I've known your legs all my life.
- Now you behave yourself in Stockholm.
- Silly girl.
- Can you smile, Mr. Craig?
- Yes, if you say something funny.
- Mr. Craig, I'm Count Jacobsson.
I welcome you to Sweden.
- Thank you. I am very happy to be here. I think.
- This is Mr. Clark Wilson, of your splendid embassy. 
- Ah yes, Mr. Wilson.
- Congratulations, Mr. Craig.
You've done us proud, Americans everywhere.
- Just one of those things
- Another picture please, Mr. Craig?
- I want to ask you a few questions, Mr. Craig, please.
- Where were you fellas when I needed
you, when my books were being published?
- Mr Stir Blackman of The Swedish Academy.
- Honored, Mr Craig.
-  Radio Sweden, a few words Mr Craig, please...
- I've always wanted to see Sweden
but I never thought I'd be able to do so
under such rewarding circumstances
-  $ 50,000 reward, huh?
- We were rather worried when you failed to
arrive on the morning plane from Copenhagen.
- I met this Danish girl in Tivoli.
- An old friend?
- She is now - Excuse
me Count Jacobsson
Mr. Craig, allow me to introduce myself - Ingerlisa
Andersen of the Swedish Foreign Ministry,
assigned to you for your stay in Stockholm
- Hello
- I have a car waiting.
- Will you follow me, please?
- Excuse me.
- Things are looking up.
- Ah Mr Craig, a few more words...
... and immediately afterwards there will be a tour of the city.
On Friday afternoon the board of directors of the Nobel foundation...
- Am I keeping you awake?
- Just barely...It's alright, go ahead
- This can wait.
- Don't get mad Miss Anderson, I'm rude to everyone.
I know that, Mr Craig. Before
taking this assignment
I tried to make myself an
authority on my subject.
- How much do you know?
- Your lack of regard for the Nobel prize.
Your threat to turn it down, your decision to
come to Stockholm only because 50,000 dollars
- How did you put it in Time magazine?
- ...ain't hay?
- That's right. "Ain't hay".
- Yes I think you have caught the outer man,
Miss Andersen
But bear in mind that 9/10ths of the iceberg
 is generally hidden from view.
- And in your case it happens to be ice cubes.
- Well, we have been doing our homework! - Thank you.
- What do you plan to do about these "ice cubes"?
- Nothing, just...hope and pray.
- We'll do our best.
- We certainly will.
How come you
instead of some aging male diplomat?
- You're unattached and alone and there
are social functions to attend.
- And we felt it would be happier for you this way.
- That's thoughtful of the Swedish government 
but aren't they a little concerned about you?
- Oh you mean your reputation with women?
- Something like that.
- Mr. Craig, I hope you'll forgive me.
but in matters of sex, compared
to the average Scandinavian,
you would be considered a mere amateur.
- Miss Anderson, would you marry me ?.
We have a saying in Sweden, Why settle for one dish, when
there's smorgasbord?
- Nice little place you have here...
- Your suite faces the Royal Palace across the water.
- I hope you find everything satisfactory.
- If the King promises not to watch...
- What's on the agenda for
you and me tonight?
- You have a formal press conference at 11
tomorrow, and I suggest you get a good night's sleep
- This is Mr. Andrew Craig, from the United States.
Mr.Lindkvist will anticipate your every need.
- Welcome to the Grand Hotel, Mr. Craig.
- Thank you very much.
- Excuse me for a moment?
- Oh yes.
- Professor Stratman.
- You will mail this for me please?. - Certainly.
- Shouldn't one Nobel
Prize winner know another?
- Mr. Andrew Craig, of literature, Dr.
Max Stratman, of physics.
- So this is the young man who
has done so many fine things with words.
- Gentlemen, please? ..
- Thank you.
- I've been looking forward to meeting you, Mr. Andrew Craig.
- And I, too, doctor. Congratulations of course.
- Yes but do you really mean 'of course'?
You and I will have to have a little talk.
- We will?
- While I admire the words you have written, I can't
say the same for what you've spoken to the newspapers
about the Nobel Prize and how it means nothing to you but money
- is that enough respect for Mr Nobel? And the wonderful United States of America?
- Tomorrow perhaps, some schnaps and conversation?
- If you promise not to spank me.
- I make no promises.
- Tomorrow.
- Tomorrow. Thank you.
- Tell me, what do people around here do at night?
- We have the Royal Opera, Theater...
- No, no, something a tiny bit more vulgar...
dancing, music ..
Beverages with a slight alcoholic content,
a little "local color" floating about...
- "Local color"
- Always adds interest to a place.
- Let's see. We have the Hamburger Bors, the
Bacchi Vapen, the Golden Crown...
- No, the Golden Crown would not do.
- Why not?
- Too many young girls with the wrong ideas.
- Awful. Glad you warned me.
- I'd better write it down for you so you'll remember to forget it. 
- Very kind of you.
- Always glad to be of service.
- Everything seems to be in order. Now
you will be ready to meet the press tomorrow morning?
- Absolutely, I'm going straight to sleep.
You wouldn't care to help me turn down my bedcovers?
- I'm afraid I have no skill as a chambermaid.
- Nobody is perfect.
- Except during Nobel week. Yes Mr Craig?
- Yes, Miss Anderson. Good night.
- I'll have the hall porter make the reservations.
- Wasn't that Andrew Craig, the Nobel
Laureate in literature? - Unfortunately.
- Stockholm during Nobel week is a china shop with no place for bulls.
- Have you read any of his books?
- We work for the Foreign Office, Miss Stratman, not the Academy of Letters.
- Well I think he's marvellous.
- Uncle Max! I thought you were off to your meeting.
- Some people it gives me a pleasure to keep waiting.
- I'm glad, now I can give
kiss you goodbye again
- What is this goodbye business?
Aren't you planning to come back tonight?
- Not if Mr and Mrs Berg keep their promise and take me
to every club I should see in Stockholm.
- And some she shoudn't see too.
- I've given Mr. Berg a list.
-  Everything from the Ambassadeur to the
Golden Crown. What can he do, he promised.
- Enjoy, enjoy. Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
Max. Max...
My old friend, Max.
- We meet again, Eckart.
- I flew in this morning just to see you.
- I should be honoured, instead my stomach hurts.
- We'll fix that.
- I know a place where the food is warm and the beer is cold.
- No, we'll walk.
- I have no wish to be seen with you.
- Well, walking is good for the soul.
You read my note?
- Yes, and I threw it away.
-  Were my congratulations not welcome?
-  I told myself, I will not answer him, I will not meet him.
- But you came.
- An old man's pride which says,
 can a man be worthy of the Nobel prize
and not be able to handle 2 minutes' conversation with a former colleague?
- Two minutes only?
- So commence.
- Your country needs you Max.
- My country is the United States of America. I have it in writing.
- Let's say my country then ..
- Which belongs to others.
- We want you with us.
- Oh please.
- I am authorised to offer you
the highest position, complete autonomy.
three times the money you earn in America.
To work for us is to give strength to the cause of Peace.
- Peace? Peace you say?
- Is there no love for the fatherland left in you?
- Strangely enough more than is left in you and your kind.
- Now listen to me.
- I am ordered to say this:
starting tomorrow when you talk to the press
- You will begin to prepare the
world for your voluntary defection to your homeland
- You will indicate the warmongering
uses to which America puts its men of science.
Then, in the concert hall, you will
make the gesture that dramatizes
your disapproval of the work you
have done for the imperialists
- This gesture, Eckart...draw me a diagram.
- It will be necessary for you to renounce the Nobel Prize.
- For this they have sent you to Stockholm? For this nonsense
you have brought me out here in the middle of the night?
- In a matter as important as this, I couldn't sleep well
 unless I had made at least one serious attempt to persuade you
...before severer measures are taken.
- So now you can sleep well.
- What is this? What are you doing?
- Skol.
- Yes, Skol.
- I've been wearing you out tonight, haven't I Mr. Berg?
- Not at all Miss Ratman.
- I always yawn deliberately after the
third smoke-filled Cabaret.
- It helps the breathing, you know.
- Oh, Rolf...
- Sorry, I do not speak Swedish.
- He doesn't speak English. He's inviting you to dance with him.
- I'd be delighted. Is it alright?
- Yes. - No.
- I told him he has one dance.
- Put it on my cheque.
- Goodnight. I think we should go now.
- I've just met some friends from  London and they've asked me to join them.
Do you mind?
- Not at all.
Goodnight. Come along, sweet.
- Thank you so much for everything, I really enjoyed the evening.
- Good night, dear. - Good night.
- I was only looking, if you don't want people to look, 
you should cover her with a bag or something.
- Hello. -Stay out of this.
- On second thoughts she'd look great in a bag.
- There's only one way to settle this, let's step outside.
- Me and the girl
- Go away - Come
on, calm down ..
- What is this, Red Cross rescue service?
- Would you care to dance?
- I don't think I could crawl.
- Well I'll sit down then.
- My name is Smith, I'm an American
tourist, and I am slightly tiddly.
- I never would have guessed.
- Shall I give you my money
now or would you rather roll me later?
- You have just given me an idea.
- Drink?
- No thanks.
- You speak very good English for a non-drinker, Miss...
- Greta Garbo.
- Mind if I call you Ingrid?
- Not at all. Why don't we get out of this crowded place?
- Don't you like crowds?
- There are some things that should only be done in private, Mr. Smith.
- And we wouldn't want to
do anything conspicuous, would we Mr. Smith?
- How old are you?
- why?
- I do not know, but most of
the girls in this place...
- You look as though you ought to be in bed.
- I accept.
- Who's your sick friend?
- We're really going to ..
- To your Hotel, of course
- What an incredible country Sweden is
- What's so incredible about it?
- It's full of surprises.
- You think this is something?
- Wait until we get to the hotel.
- Shouldn't we go up separately?
- It's alright, they know me here.
Have you got your key?
- I never make a move without it.
- You Americans are so clever.
- I haven't done anything to deserve this.
- Oh yes you have.
- Funny thing, everybody tells me that I look like
Andrew Craig, the fam....
- It's not that door, it's not that door ..
- It's... this door.
- Wrong door.
- Uh-uh. Right door.
- Wrong door.
- Right door.
- Sleep tightl, Mr. Andrew Craig.
- I'm Dr. Stratman's niece, Emily.
- You can thank me in the morning.
- Who was that?
- Andrew Craig, my good deed for tonight.
- Success!
- Success!
- We'll have it.
- Ivar said everything went alright.
- Perfectly, now you must stop worrying, Emily.
- I know.
- I command it!
- What time is it?
- 12:10. Wrong.
- You can't read the dial without your glasses.
- Smart girl. Sorry.
- Nothing closer than 6 feet.
- Fine.
- Madame Merceau, may I raise a point that might seem...irreverent?
- If the point is not too sharp.
- Considering that you and your husband achieved the Nobel prize
through your work in human reproductive cells
- Isn't it ironic that you have never had any children?
- Ironic no, explainable yes.
- I fail to see what this has to do...
- My husband and I have
worked so long together as a scientific team that...
...perhaps we may have come to see each other only as grey matter... one brain
complementing the other.
- I myself have not yet learned to cope with this situation.
- But I think my husband has made a rather successful adjustment.
- Would you care to read that back to me, Miss Seviller?
- I'm sorry, I did not get it.
- I was so sure you would.
- Perhaps you would like to say something Claude?
- No. I think you've said enough already.
- And now please forgive us.
- Where is your "sleeping beauty"?
- I'm trying, but...
- Why don't you go up and get him?
- ...together at any time, or correspond with each other?
- I will answer that. We did not work together at all.
- I knew nothing whatever of Dr.
Farelli's research, and I must assume that he knew nothing of mine.
- Only one other man knew of my techniques...
- There were Long nights of lonely battle
- I in the Superior Institute of Rome.
While unknown to me
my admirable colleague, Dr. Garrett
was pursuing his victory in far-off Pasadena, California.
- Each of us using the same methods of trial and error
- Dr. Farelli is too kind, when he gives me credit for using his methods
- I crawled from A to B to C
while he was leapfrogging from A to Z
without making a single experiment in-between.
- Well, in Rome one does as the Romans do, improvise.
- Dr. Garrett, a moment ago you said that another man knew of your work?
- Yes. Dr. Erik Ohman, a prominent surgeon right here in Stockholm.
3 years ago, when I learned that he
worked in heart transplants...
- I offered all of my findings in the strictest of confidence of course.
- One of the reasons that I'm happy to be in Stockholm is that
- I will have the pleasure of meeting Dr.
Ohman  face to face
- A pleasure which I believe you had last year, Dr. Farelli.
- In Geneva, yes.
- Regrettably there was no time for more than a brief meeting between us.
- I'm sure.
- Come in.
- Set it down, I'll have it in a moment.
- Suppose it doesn't want to be had?
- Can I interest you in leaving immediately?
- You wouldn't have some ham and eggs in that handbag?
- There's coffee at the press conference.
-... the condemned man ate a hearty nothing.
- Why all this fear of the press?
- Because it's time to let them in on a few
secrets I've been living with for much too long.
- What sort of secrets?
- I'm a slow writer.
- Well judging by last night's performance I
would say you work rather fast.
- Miss Stratman did all the work
I just supervised.
- Interbreeding of Nobel
prize winners or their
families while guests of the Swedish government
is not something we encourage, Mr Craig.
- To tell the truth, she didn't lay a glove on me.
- I'd like to be able to believe that.
- Why?
- I find honesty
irresistible in a man
- Stick around.
 - What are you planning to do? - Be irresistible.
- Except for reading everywhere that you have
 found ways to control the rays of the sun
- I have been unable to learn precisely what you have done.
- I have asked the Academy and they cannot
or will not tell me.
- Well, they cannot tell you because they have been
so instructed by the United States government.
in the name of so-called... "National Security".
- It seems that you are not completely in accord with Washington
- Well, secrecy is
becoming a way of life in this world.
- An attitude which is excused by using the word "survival".
- It's an unhappy condition for
the scientist.
- But secrecy was not the invention of the United States?
if it were not for the
Iron Curtain countries ..
-... now excuse me please.
- I will answer questions about science or myself, that is all.
- And I must remind the photographers there are to be no pictures
without  permission.
- Dr. Stratman, why did you
remain in Germany and continue your work there during the war
when so many others left the country or escaped?
- I don't know of the others' circumstances; I can only answer for my own
- Those dearest to me were in
concentration camps.
- My poor wife, my brother
Walter and his family...
- so long as I cooperated,
they were kept alive
- But unfortunately despite my efforts, only
my niece Emily survived.
- I trust this satisfies
your curiosity.
- Is it not a fact that you were
kidnapped by the US army at the end of the war?
- and taken to the United States at gunpoint and forced to work
for the American imperialists?
- No comment.
- All it takes is a simple "NO" for an answer, Professor.
- Let me end this interview by saying...
- That the scientist always prefers to
carry on his work where he can feel that his accomplishments
will not be perverted to the
exploitation of mankind.
- This has been weighing heavily on my mind of late.
- Exactly what do you mean...?
- Now I must thank you all for your attention. Good day.
- Come on Emily
- I hope it was not too much of a strain, professor.
- Perhaps the strain was on the other foot.
- Allow me to introduce our Nobel prize winner 
for literature, Mr. Andrew Craig.
- This is Dr. Stratman. - It's alright, we um...
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Craig.
- I had believed you to be a much older
man to earn such honour.
- Apparently you don't recall our meeting last night, doctor.
- How are you feeling today, Mr. Craig?
- Fine.
- Oh I mean fine, fine, yes, thanks to you.
- You and my uncle Max have met before?
- Yes, although it seems...
- Mr. Craig, they're waiting for you. - Excuse me.
- I hope you'll bear in mind  this is the world press.
- Courage! - Come on, Emily.
- I'd like to stay and listen to Mr. Craig a while, wouldn't you?
- Alright.
- Please, here.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr.
Andrew Craig of the United States.
- Ladies, gentlemen, fire away.
What was your first reaction when
you received the news of your Nobel Prize?
- No reaction at all, I
was dead drunk at the time.
- Well you seem perfectly sober
right now, so may I ask you...
- How does it feel to be with
Faulkner, Camús and Hemingway?
- I will answer that with a question: why me?.
- I haven't had a book out in five years.
- But that has little bearing on your body of work.
- Six superlative novels.
- Not one of which sold enough copies to stick in your left eye.
- Do you find that alcohol
stimulates your creative imagination?
- Not at all. It just happens to be necessary.
- Why necessary?
- I do not know, I suppose it's because I'm a sorehead,
or I'm sore at myself for not being able to
interest the reading public,
and I'm sore at your Swedish Academy.
for forcing me to die in public,
when I was doing such a damn good job of it in private.
- What about "Return to Carthage", the
book that you've been writing for the past 6 years?
- There is no "Return to Carthage".
It's all a fiction designed by me,
to conceal the fact that...
... I just ain't got it anymore.
- If your books haven't sold, and
you have not written anything for several years
- How have you been earning a living?
- Are you sure you'd like to know?
- Yes please.
- Detective stories.
- Detective stories?.
- Yes, I've been keeping myself well-dressed,
well-fed, and well-oiled by grinding out detective stories
- Mystery novels, private eyewash, all under a pseudonym.
- And don't ask me what the other name
is, I won't tell you.
- Somebody from the Swedish Academy
might read one of those books
and they would take back the $ 50,000.
- You'll forgive my saying so, sir, but I feel it hard to believe that
- the Andrew Craig who wrote "The Walls of
Croyden" and the "Imperfect State"
- is even capable of doing what
you have just described.
- Well let's just say I have a nose
for sniffing out the mysterioso in life
- for finding devious plots
in everything that I observe
- I don't suppose you'd give us a demonstration of  this "nose"?
- Well it is rather short order cooking...
... how about this one?
- Nobody steal it,
I may want to use it sometime.
- A Nobel Prize winner comes to Stockholm.
- He's wined, dined, interviewed, and...
- awarded...and all the time
- What nobody knows is that he's an imposter
- Sent by the real prize-Winner so that he can slip off
to a secret weekend of joy in Acapulco.
- Preposterous!
- Why?
- How do you know I'm really
Andrew Craig and not some gate-crasher?
- Because I look like his photographs?
Had any of you seen me before
I arrived in Stockholm?
- Maybe Dr. Stratman is really Dr.
Marceau with a beard
- and Dr. Marceau is really his wife's hairdresser...
- Thank you very much for that demonstration
- Not at all.
- I think we've taken enough of Mr.
Craig's time for now, ladies and gentlemen.
- This press conference is adjourned.
- Angry?
- I could be discharged for saying it...
... impressed.
- And there's more where that came from.
- I suggest you save it for a rainy day.
- Night..
- Mr. Craig...
- Could I talk to you for a moment?
- See, someone still wants to talk to me.
- Miss Stratman, Miss Andersen.
- How do you do Miss Andersen. Miss Stratman.
- Miss Andersen is officially in charge of me during my stay in Stockholm.
- What a delightful assignment.
- Thank you for handling it for me last night.
- Any time, Miss Anderson.
- Why don't we all have lunch or something?
- I must go now. And please, don't forget the
reception at Count Jacobsen's villa starts at 7
- Don't run.
- I'll pick you up at 6:30
- Here's my card. Office number and home number in case you need me. 
Good day.
- I don't think she likes me.
- Well I don't think I like you either.
- This just isn't my day. Where can we talk?
- There must be a bar somewhere in the Hotel.
- Well if there isn't, you'll invent it.
- Thank you. You can start
working on another one of these.
- So. - So.
- You were sort of sneaky last night.
- Wasn't I though.
- You never could have done it if I'd been sober.
- I never would have wanted to if you'd been sober.
- What did you want to?
- A fool and his Nobel reputation are soon parted.
- I think I took care of that at the press conference.
- Oh you were wonderful. - Thankyou.
- What sort of trickery do you have in store for me today?
- Trickery?
- You said you wanted to talk to me about something.
- I heard you tell my uncle Max that you met him last night.
- Yes, when I checked into the hotel in the lobby, the desk porter introduced us.
- Oh I see.
- Does your uncle have lapses of memory?
- I wouldn't know. I really
don't know Uncle Max that well.
- I was just a tiny little thing when
he went off to America.
- How could anyone leave
a tiny little thing like you behind?
- I was already in Montreal living with a
family there after my mother and father died.
- Uncle Max and I corresponded but somehow
we never managed to get together.
- Then I went to college in London and stayed on.
It wasn't till he won the  Nobel Prize and I cabled him a hint that he invite me
that I really got to see him.
-That was yesterday morning.
- We're practically strangers.
- Did you notice anything different about him
today? I mean, as compared with yesterday?
- Different? - You will laugh.
- Tell me the joke.
- Well..
.. when I met your uncle last night
he seemed quite friendly.
He was familiar with my work and me.
He enjoyed having his picture taken.
and he was noticably pro-American.
- But today...he acted as  though he'd never met me.
- His voice sounded slightly different,
he looked slightly different.
- He objected to having his picture taken and
he was noticably anti-American to the press.
- Uncle Max?
- Last night when I shook hands with him I
had the feeling I was much taller than him.
- And today he seems to...
- He seems to have grown a little.
- Mr. Craig.
- You must do
yourself a favor.
- Don't say a word about this to anyone,
and to preserve your precarious reputation...
... I won't either.
- I shall take it under advisance.
- Now I've got to run. There's Uncle Max; I promised I'd meet him for lunch.
- See you tonight if not sooner.
- Put this on my cheque, please.
- Mr. Craig. I'm Denise Marceau
- Dr. Marceau, I should have recognized you.
- How could you, when you still have in your eyes that beautiful Stratman girl?
- May I say that my eyes are large enough to hold two
beautiful women.
- So I've heard. Please sit down:
science needs the advice of literature.
- I was just going to have lunch.
- Splendid idea. Please.
- A Martini, very dry.
- Make that two.
- I believe I see Miss Stratman
in your left eye.
- Forgive me, doctor.
- No, not "Doctor", please, Denise.
- Rhymes with Chemise...
- I knew you were the right man to advise me.
- What kind of advice was this again?
- Purely literary I assure you.
- Given the following situation: A husband loves
his wife, but  has forgotten  he loves her.
- because of his infatuation with another woman's body
Problem: How should the story proceed to a happy ending for the wife?
- May I call you Andrew?
- Oh please do.
- Does she win back her husband with threats?
- Never works.
- Does she try to open his eyes to the truth about the other woman?
- What is the truth?
- Ravishing damner.
- That's bad.
- Then I see no other way but for the
wife to find an equally attractive male.
- To remind her husband that she too is desirable.
- Does that sound workable, Andrew?
- What would she have in mind for this male?
- She could pretend to a relationship...
Create the illusion... not the fact
- Not the fact?
- Thank you. Cheers.
- To illusions?
- This is my third Martini, and I
haven't even had any breakfast yet.
- I'm with the hotel. Thank you Dr. Marceau, Mr. Craig.
- We must make sure that my
husband gets a copy.
- There's a telephone call for you, Mr. Craig. Follow me please.
- Don't go away.
- Hello Mr Craig here.
- I can't... did you say Stratman?
- Well what about Stratman?
Can you speak English?
- Wait a minute.
- Excuse me, my name is Craig.
Do you speak Swedish?
- I was born in Stockholm, I hope so.
- Could you tell me what the gentleman is trying to say?
- Martin Trotzing
Lane, no. 40. He says please come right away.
Lindbloom is his name, it's something
about you and a Mr. Stratman. Very serious and urgent matter he said.
- What was that address again?
- Wait I'll write it for you.
Martin Trotzing Lane, No. 40
It is in the old town, just across the canal. Lindblom. 
And hurry right away, he says.
- Thank you very much.
- Good day.
- Let me guess. They have
called to tell you
...your Nobel prize was a clerical error.
- I don't want you to think that I am terribly rude, but something urgent
has come up and I'm going to have to leave right away.
- What's her name?
- Probably Miss "Wild goose chase."
- Will you forgive me?
- Never, and I'm going to make you
pay for it tonight.
Martin Trotzing.
- Hello...
- Mr. Lindbloom?
- Hello.
- Moos...
- What?
- Excuse me, where can
I find an officer?
- An officer, a constable?
- No, stop! Back, back!
- No I'm sorry, I can't help it,
but the whole story is so amusing.
Especially the part about the new  Dr. Stratman.
- I'm doing my best to amuse you.
- I hope you don't my asking but...had you been drinking?
- I told you I only said that to the crew that
fished me out so they'd believe I fell in.
- And I'm very glad you didn't tell them who you were.
- I was afraid they'd throw me back in.
- But no drinking, yes?
- No drinking, no, I had one Martini with Emily Stratman.
- Well, make that two... and one little Martini with Denise Marceau.
- With Denise Marceau?
- But that's all.
- What happened? No time to get around to the mother of Dr. Farelli?
- They should have left me in those clothes when they dried them in the boiler-room.
- We really should go to the hotel and let you change.
- No, no, we're going to No.40 Martin Trotzig Lane
- and then maybe you and your friend Constable
Strom will find things a little less amusing.
- I hope you won't do anything to antagonize the police,
we must keep you out of the papers.
- Just keep me out of the canal!
- This city doesn't need police
they need lifeguards.
- Mrs. Lindbloom?
- Very sorry to bother you..
- She does not speak English.
- Something's wrong, she's too cheerful.
- Ask her what happened to her husband
- May I carry on, Constable Strom?
- Please do, Miss Anderson.
Her husband is on a holiday in Switzerland,
and has been gone for almost a week.
- is that Oskar?
- His body was lying right there in this room,
I saw it this afternoon.
- She has been home all day and she says you are making a joke.
- If she think that's funny,
wait till she gets to the funeral.
- Ask her what he does for a living.
- Theatrical makeup and wigs for Swedish films.
- I see. Did he know a man by the name of Stratman?
- Perhaps we should leave, Miss Anderson.
- Wait a minute, I saw him sitting there right  in front of the tele...
.. the television set.  Ask her where
the TV set is.
- They have no television set.
- She's lying, it was right there.
- He was probably watching the press conference, something he saw, something I said,
 that's why he called me at the hotel.
- Shall we go, Mr. Craig?
- No, what does she know about Moos or Moas?
"Moos" means seagull. and
Stockholm is full of seagulls
- What's happening? - We are leaving
- You mean this is it?
- Yes
- Well I certainly enjoyed your
performance as the merry widow.
- I know what you're thinking.
- You do?
- Yes, why don't you just come right out and say it.
- Alright, I was wondering
what to wear to the reception tonight.
- Yes, you're right, I made the whole thing up
- I had nothing better to do with myself today so I invented the murder, and then
decided to try a half-gainer
...into the canal.
- Constable Strom, what are you planning to do about all this?
- As a favor to the Foreign Ministry
the police will forget the entire incident.
- You mean including the character with the sunglasses
who tried to kill me?
- The feeling seems to be that he too is on his holiday in Switzerland.
- I'm surprised you don't arrest me for drunk diving.
Oh Mr. Craig, can I trust you alone until 6:30?
- I'm just going to be soaking in a hot tub, trying to defrost.
What can happen to me?
- You could always go down the drain.
- Miss Andersen, will you do me a favor?
- Before you pick me up tonight would you mind soaking in a hot tub yourself,
 I think you could stand a little defrosting too.
- Who is it?
- Somebody dangerous.
- Hello. Still alive?
- Temporarily.
- Your press conference in the evening papers.
- How dd I make out?
- I suggest you don't learn to read Swedish.
- I don't suppose there was anyting about a dead man
named Lindbloom?
Nothing. May l?
- Nice.
- Bath oil.
- What's the Swedish word for "enchanting"?
And for female?
Who are you planning to use Swedish with tonight?
Who are you planning to enchant tonight?
- There.
- Why don't we have a little drink before we go?
- We're late. It's out of the question.
- You're absolutely right.
- What are you doing?
- Inspecting the Foreign Ministry.
And I didn't want to come to Stockholm...
- This is not on the Nobel schedule, Mr. Craig.
- I think you should be prepared to make
unscheduled flights, Miss Anderson.
- I never should have listened to you.
- What did I say?
- About defrosting in the bathtub.
- Did you?
- Much too long.
- Well I've been getting into hot
water all my life.
- I thought an iceberg never melts.
- And I thought that Sweden was neutral.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- I don't want the King to see.
- He'd understand,
that I'm merely doing my duty.
- Don't stop
- I'm keeping you out of one kind of trouble..
...by getting you into another.
- This calls for more than a drink.
- This calls for all sorts of things.
- Yes?
- I may even have to...
- Yes... Yes.
- No! We can't be late for the reception.
- There are the Stratmans.
- And here are we.
- And let's keep it that way
- I think we ought to mosey over
and see what we can see.
- I think not.
- You just don't want me to be near Emily
- I just don't want you near her uncle.
- If it is her uncle.
- See what I mean?
- Oh, boy!...
- What is it?
- That waiter over there...
- What about him?
- He looks like the guy...
- Hello waiter, waiter? Excuse me...
Haven't we met somewhere before?
- Sir?
- Oh now surely you remember me? Andrew Craig.
- Nobel laureate in drowning.
- How about this? Lindbloom, chop, chop.
- Nothing, huh? what's your name?
Darany, sir. Would you like a canapé?
- Which one has the body in it?
- Don't look at me that way,
where's Count Jacobsson?
- No Please..
- why not?
- I don't want to see you make a fool of yourself
- Then you'd better stay here.
- Count Jacobsson!
-Ah, there you are Mr. Craig.
- Dr. Farelli, Mr. Craig.
- Delighted.
- Signora Farelli, Mr. Craig.
- And here's Dr. Garrett, and Mrs. Garrett.
- Congratulations, Craig.
- We're a long way from home, aren't we.
- You can say that again.
- I want to see you.
- John, not now...!
- There's something very strange happening here...
- Yes of course. This is Dr. Denise Marceau and Dr. Claude Marceau.
- Andrew!
- I never should have left you today.
- Your wife and I almost had lunch together.
- I  have already seen the photograph of your tete-a-tete, Mr Craig.
- I hope we were in focus ..
- Thank you for the flowers you sent me.
Three dozen of the most beautiful roses!
- Well, I'm extravagent, aren't you?
- Ms. Souvir, Secretary of Dr. Claude Marceau.
- Hello.
- Congratulations, Doctor.
- Ah, finally..
- Oh you know Mr. Wilson of your embassy here?
- Yes, yes of course...
- Well Mr Craig, that was quite a splash you
made in your newspaper interviews today.
- Well if you think that was a splash...
Now you see that waiter over there?
- Yes - Do you know who he is?
- Obviously an employee of the firm catering this occasion.
- His name is Darany. - I see.
- Please..
Please don't laugh, but he tried to kill me today.
- My dear Count, what your guests say if
they knew you employed such inferior servants?
- Mr. Craig please I beg of you
- He murdered a man by the name of Lindbloom who was
going to tell me something about Dr. Stratman.
- He knows that I know so he pushed me into the canal.
- And you drowned, no doubt?
- I think we should call the police and question the
fellow and see if we can't find Lindbloom's body.
- Oh, it's missing?
- Yes
- How awkward. - Mr Craig, don't you think you have gone far enough?
- I did my best to save you from yourself today
by cutting your press conference short.
- I tried to save you further embarrassment by not telling Mr. Wilson
Miss Andersen's report to me.
- What report?
- She's given me full details of your highly imaginative afternoon.
- Oh she has, eh?
- I found it necessary to reprimand her for
not attending to you properly.
- Oh you shouldn't have done that
 - I hope I won't have to do it again.
- Gentlemen...
- Well?
- Nothing. So, you reported to Count Jacobsen today, eh?
- I had to, please believe me.
- Did he tell you what kind of bath oil to use?
- You don't think that do you?
- I don't know what to think.
- This, foolish man.
- You know whatever is going on around here I'm going to
get to the bottom of it
- If only to prove to you that I am not as big a nut as you think I am.
- What are you going to do?
- Even if I knew do you think I'd tell you?
- You'd blab everything to teacher.
- What would you like, dear?
- I can't quite make up my mind.
- Hello there!
- Hello. Who are you...How are you
tonight Doctor?
- Too many bubbles in the mouth, eh, Mr. Craig?
- You should have seen the bubbles in my mouth this afternoon.
- I'm afraid you're a little too quick for us.
- Only two kinds, they say, the quick and the dead, eh professor?
- I'm sorry, do you know Miss Anderson of the foreign ministry?
- Good evening Miss Anderson.
- Excuse me.
- Dr. Stratman, oh I'm so relieved to see you here this evening.
- I hope you didn't think I was too feeble for such festivities, Mrs. Garrett.
- Oh no, you see this evening when my husband 
returned to the hotel, he said to me:
- Saralee,  I know it couldn't be, but I could have sworn 
I saw Dr. Max Stratman
- In a hospital corridor this afternoon, being
wheeled to an operating room or someplace, and he looked sort of unconscious
- and I said, "You must have been seeing things,"
and ...well I was right, wasn't I Dr. Stratman?
- Hold the fort.
- John, where is that man now?
- My drinking has nothing to do with it.
- Now please, Dr. Garrett... - You're going to hear what I have to say!
- You can fool the Nobel committee,
and the press but you can't fool me.
- You're joking with me, Dr. Garrett.
- Don't give me that innocent Italian charm.
- Sure, Erick Ohman had nothing to tell me at the hospital this afternoon,
- So that is it - How could he, after you got to him first.
- I give you my word...I never, never..
- You used my findings! My years of work!
- No.
- And covered the thievery with one rotten, lying word: improvise.
- Make yourself sober. And maybe someday I will let you apologize.
- Wait! No, wait, wait, wait.
- Stay out of this!
- I am most embarrassed, Mr. Craig.
- Go to hell!.
- I'm very sorry but there's something I have to ask you.
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Which hospital did you visit today?
- Leave me alone!. - No Dr. Garrett, this is important.
- Your wife said that you saw a man that looked like
Max Stratman being wheeled down a hospital corridor today.
- An amazing likeness.
- Yes, but which hospital?
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- But which hospital?
- Flora Sanitarium, fourth floor.
- Thanks.
- I've just done a wicked thing, I've changed the placecards at the
dinner table to put us side by side.
- Oh well you'd better switch them back again or you'll be talking to an empty chair.
- We've just had a lovers' quarrel?
- What do you know about the Flora Sanitarium?
- It's a private institution for rich nervous breakdowns.
- Where is it?
- On  Parsunden - How far away?
- A few minutes driving time.
You're not thinking of leaving?
- I'll be right back. - but dinner?
- Make excuses for me..
- I'll go with you
- Oh no you won't.
- What took you so long?
- I didn't know I was expected.
- Mr. Craig's coat, please.
- Shall we use your car or mine?
- Are we going somewhere together?
- That hospital of course.
- Of course...
- It's alright.
- Meanwhile, back at the ranch they discover we're both missing.
- Wonder what they'll think?
- People will say we're in love.
- Tell me something. Earlier today you implied that I was
imagining things and pretty ridiculous things at that.
- Here you are on your way to double-check them.
Why did you change your mind?
- Oh I haven't changed my mind,
I just want to be there when you change yours.
- I see.
- You don't sound very convinced.
- But I'm beginning to
be convinced about you alright
- Wait here.
- Yes, if I'm not out  in 2 days, come in and get me.
- Good evening. Do you speak English?
- Somewhat.
- Do you have a patient named Stratman?
- Wait here please.
- Mind if I do the talking?
- I'm not even here.
- I'm Dr. Eckart.
May I be of assistance?
My name is Craig, this is Miss Stratman.
We're trying to find out  if you have a patient here
- Miss Stratman's uncle, Dr. Max Stratman.
Or else someone who looks like him.
- Possibly on the fourth floor
- There's no Stratman here.
- Well here's a picture of him, does that face look familiar?
- Oh, Nobel prizewinner. And
that's you, Mr. Andrew Craig, I'm honoured.
- Yes or no, Dr.?
- No.
- It's a matter of some urgency. 
Would you object if we looked around the 4th floor?
- Is this your request, Miss Stratman?
- Yes
- Come with me
- Sorry.
- What about that one?
- Unoccupied.
- For how long?
- A week or so.
- May l?
- Please.
- Coming, Mr. Craig?
- I suppose you must think that I'm...
Where's Miss Stratman?
- I believe she's waiting downstairs.
- I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you, doctor.
- No bother, it gave me the pleasure of meeting you.
- Alright.
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.
- Not again!...
- Come on Derany... Just because I didn't eat one of your damn canapés?
- Excuse me, I need help. Could you tell me where I can get...
- [Woman talks in Swedish].
[in Swedish]
"NUDIST MEETING"
- Herrer, of course.
- .. someone's following me.
- Clothes off or no in here.
- I need the police ..
- Nothing on! Nothing on!
- Stop it, I'm ticklish.
- Hold on, please.
- Hold it, just a minute, do you speak English?
- Yes, most of us here do, I'm sure.
- I need help.
- Then as a courtesy to our visitor from another land
I will continue in English.
- alright?
- No, you don't understand, I'm in trouble!
- Clothing does more than keep out the sun and air.
- It makes the human anatomy excessively mysterious.
giving rise to improper thoughts ..
.. Just a minute ! I am being followed by
two men who are trying to kill me.
- They're right back there,
I want you to send for the police.
- No I'm serious, I can't
explain everything to you, but...
- Americans are rarely serious about nudism.
but kindly remember that you are in Sweden...
- Yes and about to get a knife in my naked back.
- Now please, do not disrupt this meeting again, because if you persist
I will summon the police.
- Can I borrow your towel?
- I should say not!... police?
- If a man came upon a naked Swedish girl 
or a naked Frenchwoman by accident.
- You can be sure it was no accident.
- She would quickly cover a certain area of her lower body with her hands.
- But, if she were a naked Arab woman 
she would cover her face before all else
- Oh yes I've got a couple of tomatoes back home 
that I wish would do the same thing.
- I have asked you to stop!
- And leave that poor Arab woman with her bare face hanging out?
- If a man were to surprise a
naked Chinese woman...
... she would try to hide her feet.
- A Celebese woman would cover her knees, a Samoan girl, her navel.
- That's nothing, I once I surprised a girl who
was, part Chinese, part Samoan and part Célebese, when I...
- She had a terrible time.
- Under international nudism,
every part of the body would be revealed.
- What about elbows?
- A person would have to cover nothing..for there would be nothing to fear. 
- Question, question.
- The consequence would be a generally higher standard of morality all around.
- Mr. speaker, I demand to know your position on the question of naked elbows.
- Why don't we throw him out.
- Let's get him out!
- Be patient, he will not be with us for long.
Permit me to continue.
- Stop peeking  at me. What
kind of nasty minds do you have anyway?
- If someone touches me, I'll scream!
- My friends, what is our goal?
It is to promote physical
well-being, in a more relaxed..
- Hypocrisy!... Lies!  I wish to be heard. Now listen to me all of you.
- I'm  speaking as an American citizen, and as a non-nudist,
- Throw him out, Mr. Norburg.
... temporarily caught with his pants down. But..
- Don't listen to Mr. Norbert there because he's playing the skin game.
While you're sitting here in the altogether
Your clothing lies back there in the locker-room, 
it's at the mercy of professional thieves.
- Mr. Norberg is stealing the shirts off your back and that's the naked truth!
Easy does it boys.
- You will put your clothing on, please.
- If you want me to go in there you'll have to come in there with me.
- Can't you dress yourself?
- There are 2 men in there waiting to kill me.
- Why do you think I sent for you?
- Ah, come along.
- Alright.
- Yes, they got away.
- Yes, yes, just get dressed.
- How do you like that, they stole my clothes!
- Hold on to your towel, please. Come along..
- Yes I think we ought to go straight to headquarters.
I've got a rather involved story to tell and it may take some time
but it's rather urgent.
- Ja, sure.
- There won't be any need to tell us anything, Mr. Craig.
We know all about you and your stories from Constable Strom.
- Yes, well I can explain all that...
- Please, in the car...
- Get some sleep, Mr. Craig.
- Thanks a lot!
- I'm going to four, you?
- Six!
- I always take a brisk walk before bedtime.
Helps me to fall asleep.
- It was a bit chilly out tonight.
That's why I wore the towel.
- No key.
- No ma'am, please. Ma'am!
- Denise!
- Andrew.
- May I...come in?
- Such a question.
- At last you are living up to your reputation.
- I'll explain about all this some other time.
- But I understand everything.
- Well but right now could you do me a favour, call the
desk and have them send me up my key, to room 443?
Immediately.
- Meanwhile why don't you put on something more comfortable?
-To a beautiful evening.
- To the woman who has made it beautiful.
- Dr. Marceau, telephone. Follow me please.
- Hello?
- Claude? It's Denise.
[in French] - I wanted to tell you there's a naked man in my room.
- No! It's not possible.
- Hello, this is Dr. Marceau. Would you kindly send to my room 
the key to Mr. Andrew Craig's suite, no. 443?
Well of course
it's for him.
- Ships...
- Your key's on the way.
- Put this on, and give me that ridiculous towel.
- Thanks. Hello?
- Could you hold on for just one moment please.
Hello? Andrew Craig speaking.
Do you have a bureau of shipping here in the city?
- One hook in the back, would you please Andrew?
- That's right, arrivals and departures.
- Now let me tell you what you missed at the reception tonight.
- No, no, some other time. What was that?
- And the zipper.
- Well could you find out what time they open in the morning? Yes I'll wait.
A marvellous reaction took place between my husband's
secretary and that charming Italian, Dr. Farelli.
Oh, wonderful.
- Thanks to my scientific manipulation of the placecards at the dinner table.
Yes? What are you doing?
- Oh I'm so happy I want to share it with you.
- Never mind, some other time.
- Hello Claude. You know Andrew Craig?
- More so every moment.
- My dressing gown looks almost as well on you as it does on me.
- And so, I might add, does my wife.
- Very ingenious woman, your wife.
- Excuse me.
the key of Mr. Craig.
- I have to run.
Goodnight, doctor, I shall return this in the morning.
- Denise...
- Thank you, Andrew. Oh, Andrew!
- You forgot your towel!
- Denise, I think you need to be watched more closely.
- I think so, too.
- Hello. - How could you do this to me?
- You deserve it.
- I've been beside myself all night.
 - I wish I could be beside yourself all night.
- Tell me what happened?
- You would never believe it.
- Pretty..
- It's not mine, it's Claude Marceau's,
his wife gave it to me.
- Well I was naked, what else could she do?
- And what was she wearing?
- Oh sort of an off-the-shoulder smile.
I want to know everything.
- First things first...- Now where would you like to start?
- With Denise Marceau and you...naked...or Emily
Stratman and you, cleverly slipping away from the party?
- Ah, the Foreign Ministry is jealous.
- And waiting for an answer.
In due time, in due time. First, I have to get some
shipping information and the bureau of shipping is closed.
- What sort of shipping?
- Cargo ships, freighters, everything in port.
- What's arriving, what's sailing.
I hope not sailed.
- That should be in the evening papers.
- Of course.
- You translate; I've got to get dressed.
- Am I permitted to ask the importance of these ships?
- Yes, I'm playing a hunch. Good old Max Stratman has been
hustled aboard one of them from that sanitarium tonight.
- Please.
- Well everything today sailed this afternoon.
- What about tomorrow?
- White Explorer destination San Francisco...
- No.
The George B. Wilson bound for Marseille...
- No.
- The Boulanger for Antwerp. - No.
- Dampschiff Möwe for Leningrad.
- Leningrad? Hmm. Well, go on.
- Nothing, probably just a coincidence, but...
"Möwe" is German it means "seagull".
- Lindbloom's seagull. That's what he
was trying to tell me, that's it, that's got to be it.
- Arrives pier 18 tomorrow morning from Tallinn. - But not in yet?
- And sails tomorrow night to Leningrad.
- Tomorrow night? Of course,
right after the Nobel ceremonies.
- With the real Stratman on board, smuggled behind the Iron Curtain
while who knows what that phony Stratman does at the ceremony.
- You're going too fast for me.
- No, it's perfect, it all fits. Now then.
- If we do anything tonight,
it might tip them off
force them to change their plans, they might even kill Stratman.
- But tomorrow, they will fall into
their own trap. They'll put Stratman aboard the Seagull.
- And then we have the police move in and search the ship.
- On what evidence?
- No evidence, a hunch and a damn good one, isn't that enough?
- Enough for an international incident, yes.
- I love everything about
you, except your misguided diplomatic caution.
- Lindbloom had something to tell me. That word was 'seagull'.
Daranyi tried to kill me again tonight.
- So tomorrow we are going to go to Count Jacobsson,
to get some action before it's too late.
- Alright, we'll talk to Count Jacobsson, 
he'll be at Concert Hall at the rehearsal tomorrow.
- And you'll back me up?
- Yes - Promise? - Yes.
- Who is it?
- The bellboy, sir.
- Mr. Craig, a gentleman brought these to the hotel
saying you forgot your clothing at the gymnasium.
- On the chair, please.
- Was he a tall gentleman with a thin face?
- Yes sir. - That was no gentleman.
- He instructed me to say to you he will be seeing you again.
- How comforting.
- Will there be anything else tonight, sir?
- I hope so.
- Oh c'mon...
- I think I like you a little bit.
- i think I like you a little bit, too.
- And I approve of gymnasiums.
You must be in excellent physical condition.
- You must be in excellent physical condition too.
- Good night, dear assignment.
- Goodnight.
- To the Concert Hall, please.
- Remember me, Mr. Craig? Dr. Eckart.
- I never forget the face.
- Please forgive me for inviting myself into your car.
- But I feared I might not have an opportunity to speak to you in time.
- In time?
- About Ms. Ingerlise Anderson.
- What about Miss Anderson?
- I know how greatly it would grieve you if she were to be found
tomorrow the victim of some unfortunate accident.
- Eckart, I don't know who you are.
- and I don't know exactly what all this dirty mess is about, but
how would you like to wind up in one of your own hospital beds?
- Attend strictly to your own affairs.
- And immediately after the great Nobel event ends, Miss
Anderson will be released.
- As untouched and as lovely as she was when she left last night.
- What do you mean, 'released'?
- She's perfectly safe in our hands, I assure you.
- You're lying, she's waiting for me now at Concert Hall.
- No, Mr. Craig.
- If she's not there, I'll call the Foreign Ministry and they will...
- They'll tell you that she was regrettably summoned to
the bedside of an aging relative in northern Sweden.
- We have already sent a message in her name.
- You will do nothing further, say nothing further to anyone.
- Particularly the authorities.
Is that clear Mr. Craig?
- Her life is in your hands now.
Oh here we are. Concert Hall.
- If you don't mind I'll continue in this car.
- Now rise gentlemen, and after a moment come down to me, the King,
to accept your award.
- Perhaps you'd like to accept both prizes?
- If you mean an additional prize for tolerance and restraint, yes.
- His Majesty will then make the presentation, Dr.
Farelli, and take your hand...
... Dr. Garrett...
- Excuse me.
- Your hand.
- Now gentlemen if you will step back, bow,
and return to your seats
- Not so fast, I
just want to thank you for everything.
- Especially last night you've been such a lovely little peach.
- Do you mind, please...
- I thought I didn't give a damn about the Nobel Prize but now
 thanks to you and your ugly little playmates
I'd rather lose my neck than see the wrong man get it.
- I've had about enough thanks for today. - You will
have a lot worse coming if anything...
- if anything happens to Ingerlise Anderson, remember that
- Mr. Craig, you are just in time.
- Where is Miss Anderson?
- Oh I'm sorry, she had to journey to Entersvijk. An illness in the family.
But I can arrange for someone else.
- Oh no, never mind.
- Then if you'll take your place on the stage please?
- I can't.
- But, the rehearsal? - .. there isn't time.
- Why, is something wrong?
- No, nothing at all.
- Then, please...
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Craig!...
What's this? What's this?
Well help me! I'm a writer,
not a weightlifter.
- Mr. Craig.
- Are you alright, professor?
- I never felt better in all my life.
- Although it's all your fault. You should have stayed with me last night.
- Or your fault. You didn't insist.
- What's this all about?
- You tell him, Miss Anderson.
- The other Stratman is his brother.
- Emily's father?
- Yes, twin brother Walter.
- Supposed to have died in a prison camp during the war.
- Get his belt.
- Wound up behind the Iron Curtain,
- and  became one of them. Dedicated.
- Tie his feet.
- But it's him they want. His brain working for them.
- A man named Eckart is running the show.
- And boasting to me in that hospital about all his tricks, the dirty swine.
- What tricks?
- It would be bad for world opinion if they kidnapped me.
- So they have to make it seem like I was leaving because I wish to leave.
My brother will step onto the stage at Concert Hall posing as me.
- And nobody will ever know the truth.
- Only he's not going to get on that stage
because you're going to get there first.
- We'll never make it in time.
- What's Emily's part in this?... the door.
- First they shocked her with the news that
her father was still alive.
- Then they forced her to help,
saying his life would be in danger if she didn't.
- You mustn't blame my
Emily, she really loves me.
- Well I am glad to hear that.
- Alright, you're off to the Concert Hall.
- No, I'm too weak. - Aren't we all?
- It'll be alright.
- What now?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
- Stop, hold him.
-  I guess we're going to have to take a ride.
- Must we?
- It's the only way, come on.
- And I was so comfortable...
- I'll be in the next one.
- Derany!
- Do you know what you're doing to me?
- I guess we'll have to get married.
- You haven't given me an answer. - To what?
- My proposal.
- The answer's yes, if you
take your elbow out of my ribs.
- Let's go.
- Alright professor?
- Kaputt bin ich!
- How does this work?...
- Pull this one.
- Dr. Farelli!
- Hello, Mr. Craig.
- I hate to do this, but I need you, Max Stratman's collapsed.
- Where is?
- Right here, follow me.
- The house doctor's out in an emergency, they don't know for how long.
- It's very serious.
- Dr. Garrett, come on in.
- I don't think you need me.
- Please Dr. Garrett, quickly, I must have your opinion.
- He's had a cardiac arrest.
- Ventricular fibrillation I think.
- His heart is fluttering, there's no effective beat.
It's hopeless unless we can get him to a hospital.
- It's too late, no time, no time.
- I think he's failing.
- You can't let that happen.
- Improvise...
- What are you going to do?
- He must live.
- Open his shirt.
- You'll kill him!
- Get back.
- Don't touch him. Stand back.
- Where am I, heaven?
- Stockholm.
- Oh, heaven!
- We did it, Dr.
Garrett. We did it!
- You did it.
- Wait a minute.
- We are late for Concert Hall.
- Getting out of bed now would be a grave risk.
- But now at the great moment of my life.
- My dear Stratman, if I were you I would stay put.
- But you're not me. I'm going.
Nothing will stop me.
- Nothing .. please, I feel fine.
- Alright, just rest a moment.
- Shall we tell them that you are...
- No, no, don't tell anybody about anything,
regardless of what happens later, alright?
- Alright.
- Everybody, hear me, get ready. The King is entering. Mr.
Craig?
- How do you feel?
- I feel well, Dr. Farelli, how do you feel?
- Where is Mr. Craig?
He's not here. What's going to happen?
- That I should have to wear a head-waiter's uniform,
instead of my beautiful dress-suit!
- Think of the poor head-waiter, sitting around in hs underwear.
- All my life I'm an ox; tonight I feel like a dog.
- You're doing fine. Up there.
- I can't do it.
- To Dr. John Garrett of the USA
and Dr. Carlo Farelli of Italy.
- Let me rest.
- Why don't you let me carry you doctor?
- Because I'm a stubborn old man who wants to do this on his own two feet.
- The introduction is brief,
they're coming to you, Dr. Stratman.
- For his distinguished research
in the field of photochemical solar energy conversion
- for his discovery
of hitherto undreamed of methods of employing solar energy
...to synthesize new rocket propellants
- The Nobel Prize in Physics, to Dr.
Max Stratman of the USA
- I want to talk to you. -
Let go! - It's about your daughter Emily.
- I have no daughter.
- I know you're Walter Stratman, I know the whole story.
- Please!
- Stratman!
- She did it for you
do something for her...free her, tell her she's got no obligation.
- Look out!
- Wait, wait I'm not... Max Stratman.
... ach you fool.
- Take care of him.
- A good performer knows .. when
to leave the stage... ja, liebchen?
- And so farewell to Max and farewell to Walter Stratman.
- And goodbye to the makeup magic of Oskar
Lindbloom, who could not hold his tongue.
- And my father?...
- We had to deceive you into believing  he was alive.
- in order to get your help.
- Who are you?
- I'm just an actor...
- ...who specializes in political roles.
- Your friend Mr. Craig has
rewritten my ending...badly.
- For his writings in support
of humanitarian ideas,
for his restless curiosity,
his unending search for the truth, his unconquerable spirit,
...and his adventurous
imagination that seems to recognize no boundaries...
- The Nobel Prize of Literature, to Mr.
Andrew Craig of the USA.
- I owe him so many explanations  I won't  know where to begin.
- From London, by mail.
Why do I always worry each year that
something is going to go wrong?
It never does.
