- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks buddy, thanks. Thanks.
Put it there, near the wall.
So it won't block the way.
Bro… The photos arrived.
Thank you Çetin.
Stand next to the door
and give them to the comers.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thanks, thank you.
Mr. Ozan. Welcome Mr. Ozan,
welcome.
Please have it.
There are too many reporters.
I'm attaching it on your collar…
- I can attach it.
- I managed it.
This way please Mr. Ozan.
- I'm sorry for your loss Mr. Ozan.
- Thanks, thank you.
Mr. Ozan, it was told that your father
was really sick in his last days, …
…can you make a statement please?
It's told that you did not
get along well.
Guys, if you'll excuse me,
we have a funeral. Please.
- Please make a statement.
- Can you please make a statement?
- Please.
- Please make a statement.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
I was stucked in the traffic.
Well done.
- Did the funeral start?
- No.
Not yet. We were waiting for the headliner.
Now he is here, we can start.
It would be enough if you'd told me
"You're late".
Don't worry, you're not late.
Your favourite part is starting now.
Look, they are already in the queue.
It's not an autograph queue.
Now you're being silly.
He was my dad too.
Yeah.. Don't try to embrace and call me
"Brother"…
…I can't stand this much sentimentality.
Just a moment, just a moment…
I am their Sis Fadik. Just a second.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Ozan... I'm sorry for your loss, son.
Thank you.
Ozan.
When I look at your face,
I see your dad. Son.. Son.
I was the one who raised you.
Say "My sis". You called me Sis Fadik,
say "My sis".
- Come on, say it my son.
- I will, if you let me...
I can not say.
What was your name?
Fadik, call me Fadik. But call it loud,
so everybody can hear your voice.
Fadik Sis, thank you sis.
Come on, there are other people waiting.
Yes..
We love you so much,
I'll vote for you.
In Eurovision.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Sis Fadik, I'm your Sis Fadik.
Who is this woman,
she was strangling me.
She raised you.
Your Sis Fadik said that.
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Thanks.
Hakan, my son, your father
was a unique man.
- Uncle Cemil…
- Erkan was a loyal man.
- What are you doing Uncle Cemil…
- He liked me too..
I know, he liked you.
What are you doing?
Be friends again my son!
Be friends again!
- You should be friends again in the funeral.
- Uncle Cemil…
Your dad was also sad for your situation.
- Uncle Cemil, what are you doing?
- There are people waiting.
- Tell me you are friends again.
- Uncle Cemil, just a second.
Alright, stop, for God's sake. Alright,
look, we are friends again. Is it OK?
Did you come to bargaining for it?
Uncle Cemil, please...
It's OK. I'm sorry for your loss, son.
Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you Uncle Cemil.
- Thank you Uncle Cemil, thanks.
I did it just to get rid of the man,
don't let me be misunderstood.
I gave up to try to understand you
for years.
Don't worry.
OK, we are here with Zeynep
we're waiting.
OK, we'll let you know.
I told you, don't worry.
Do you remember the day
this picture was taken?
Yes I do.
This wedding was in Devrek, huh?
Where has this guy been?
What an occasion it was.
Bride's relatives kicked up a row
when gloom's relatives danced a bit longer.
Reporters are still there.
If I were them, I would also wait.
Celebrity brothers
don't talk to each other…
…and they are in their father's funeral.
Great news.
- Buddy…
- Just a second.
I am sorry guys, I got late.
There are too many reporters down there.
And it's damn hot.
Hold these.
Our son adores you.
But it's forbidden. It's forbidden.
I shot the photo.
I brought bananas for you.
He brought bananas for us.
We're supposed to eat them.
Mr. Ozan, this is not the best way to eat.
Now I'm going inside and cut it in…
…small pieces and make a nice…
If you need anything, we are there.
- Alright buddy, thanks.
- Guys…
…Which one is Erkan's chair?
That one.
He told me to put it here.
Now that you both are here,
we can watch it.
- What do you mean with watching?
- He doesn't have a written will.
He recorded a video and wanted you
two to watch it together.
Now take a seat, let's watch it.
Come on.
Come on.
If you are ready, I will start it.
Who is this kid?
The son of our neighbour. If you'd
dropped by sometimes, you'd know him.
Everybody would think that you were
always with him.
Did you set it up Ahmet?
Yes I did Uncle Erkan.
Is it recording now?
Yes, it is.
You can talk whenever you want.
Alright. You should go out now,
I will use some swear words.
Look at me assholes…
…now that you are watching this video…
…it means that I am already
gone and with your mom.
Now, listen to me carefully.
When your mom died, one of you were 5
and the other was 3 years old.
We grew up together. I was both a mother
and a father to you.
I can not say that I was a great father…
…I might have done some mistakes.
But I'm a father you assholes.
Fathers love as much as they beat
In this life…
…I mean in that life, …
…there was only one thing I could do,
and that was music.
And I taught you everything I knew.
You've been successful.
Well done.
I was just a wedding singer.
I beat around the bush.
Now there are one or two pieces…
…I wanted to share.
What does he have to share?
A house and an old car.
Let's start with the house.
You know, we had good times and
bad times in this house.
Every corner is full of memories.
You both were born in this house.
Therefore it's sentimental value
is very high for me.
I want to leave this house to you…
…but I sold it.
What did you do?
Sold it?
- I sold it five years ago.
- Dad, who did you sell it to?
To the greengrocer.
Bu I bought it for a very good price.
I have one or two things to say.
I wanted to solve them
before I am dead.
We know the things on your mind.
I put some money on the side, so that I
could go on pilgrimage and close off, but…
…it was not possible.
I have some rental debts to the landlord,
I mean to the greengrocer.
Let Ozan pay it.
Here, this is my IBAN,
you can do it to this number.
Why did he palm the debt off to me?
In return…
…Ozan, I'm leaving my shaving set
and the 45 singles to you.
45 singles are there.
Hakan…
…I'm leaving my…
…mustache comb and keyboard to you.
Give the rest to the poor people,
let them pray for me.
And now with the car.
Like this house, it's also full
with memories.
We know for sure.
We know. After the weddings
we always kept watch on it's door.
Well, we might have returned late
after some weddings.
After all, I am a man too…
…I have also some needs,
you cuckolds.
I was a very young man
when your mom was dead.
Everybody needs somebody.
The doctor told that I'll be
dead at the least in three weeks.
Don't let the old man die earlier.
Whatever…
I'm leaving the car to you, Hakan.
OK, it's a boneshaker, but
why does he leave it to you?
And I'm leaving the car keys to you, Ozan.
Dad, are you kidding us?
What's up? You are surprised, aren't you?
You didn't talk to each other for years...
let's see if you can handle this
without talking to each other?
Let's get down to business.
You can't take it with you when you die.
Kids, I have a last wish.
I want you to play together in a wedding.
A friend called me and asked for it…
…if I were alive I would say
"Let's go together", but…
…as you know, you already buried me.
I told the greengrocer
the place and date of the wedding.
What are you looking at?
My last wish from you as a father.
If I have a father’s right on you…
…don't break my heart.
The battery shouldn't go dead.
The kid has homework.
Alright guys, you heard your father.
The address of the wedding location…
…is here.
When you arrive the wedding place
and fulfill the will…
…I will send the second part of the video.
In the worst case you call me
and I'll bring it myself…
…because I have delivery service too.
We have the freshest fruits and vegetables.
You may need them before your concert…
…I mean fruits.
Again, my condolences to you.
Ayşe Yılmaz.
Wedding is at the weekend, in Urla.
What the hell is this wedding thing?
At the last moment he did it again.
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
I don't sing with you.
I'm not dying to play
with you at the weddings.
And I have a gig at the weekend,
not in this life.
I am trying not to be seen on tabloids
with this asshole…
you're telling me to get on stage with
him. What the hell are you doing dad?
I agree.
I will get on the stage with a guy whose 3
records don't sell as much as my one single..
…huh, mom?
My records doesn't sell in refectories with
children stuff. Don't make me sick.
In the end, whether your music reaches,
everybody or not, this is what matters.
Fuck off!
The wedding is just an excuse, isn't it?
You don't even want to be
seen with me.
Yes.
Wow, this is the first time
I ever agree with you.
I agree.
- Well then.
- Well then.
- Alright.
- Alright.
Dude?
Mr Ozan is here… I am here.
They went out. They went out!
We've been waiting for hours,
we hope they will make a statement.
They're still there.
Now I will summarize the situation
Mr. Ozan…
…they are camping next to the door, and don't
want to leave without hearing something.
I can send them away.
I can… No.
Dude…
…it seems that they won't go
unless you go out…
…and say something.
Your people won't leave.
Go out and say something so they leave.
Why should I go out?
You go out.
You love this kind of things.
You go out.
If you don't go out, neither do I.
I better stay at home instead of
show up with you in the tabloids.
- Alright, wait then.
- Sure I wait.
- I wait also.
- I wait till morning.
- And I wait till night.
- I wait in my room if I want.
- Can't I wait in my room.
- I'm going to my room.
- Then go to your room.
- I wait.
Wait.
Hakan, pizza is delivered.
I'm sorry because I made you keep waiting.
No worries bro.
We are friends.
When will I help you,
if I don't help you now.
Thanks.
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.
Mr. Ozan, I'm sure you are hungry.
I did a nice fillet…
for you.
Bon appetit.
Why didn't you put it in a package?
Why are you doing things like that?
Didn't I tell you not to exaggerate?
What is that?
Flower.
- Did you pluck it from the wreath?
- Yes.
Otherwise they'd throw it away. So it wouldn't
go to waste and it would be decorative.
Prayers for your beloved dad's soul.
Bon appetit.
Bravo.
I will leave the magazine department
and will be a sport reporter.
The league table and match times are fixed.
What the fuck is that? We are waiting
the whole day. Is it always like that?
No Zeynep, normally they allocate a
caravan to us, but not this time.
I guess you are new here.
I am but I don't intend to stay long.
You see dad? He took the
guitar and is bullying.
But it's obvious…
…he missed the old good days.
Daddy, what kind of last wish is this?
Why do you leave such a will,
although you know that I won't do it?
What is going on?
I thought for a moment…
…should we play together
just like the good old days.
I gave up.
Come on…
…the strings were really old.
They are decayed for sure.
They are.
Dad, what the fuck are you looking at?
What are you looking at?
Ok, it may be your last wish, but
I won't go on stage with that fucker.
- I'm cleaning up here.
- Çeto.
What is going on?
I am hundred percent sure, that I won't
enjoy any moment with you on stage.
But I should my dad's last wish.
I am not a fan of yours either.
But our deceased father wanted that,
nothing to do.
Well then get prepared.
What do we with the reporters?
I have a plan for it.
Take this cap off for God's sake.
I guess the strings are decayed.
My cap is fucking awesome.
I'm crazy for it.
- What's going on?
- Wake up, wake up!
Hold on. Hold on.
Open the trunk.
The coast is clear.
What are you doing?
- Give me the key.
- Nope, I'll drive.
- Didn't you hear dad? He left the car to me.
- But he left the car keys to me.
- Don't make me sick, give them to me.
- Alright, take.
But I will also drive sometimes.
We'll see.
- We'll see, huh.
- Move…move.
Hello, I think I have a story.
I'm not sure but something
weird is happening now.
OK? I can't come anywhere in the morning.
- Which way will you drive?
- I'll handle it, get off my back.
- I think we better use second, then leave.
- Ah.
I think you better sleep.
Turn from here then
leave from the right side.
God give me patience.
OK, we do a U-turn ahead.
Why don't you turn?
- Urla is İzmir, you know that, huh?
- Ozan!
Do you want to go to Urla through Edirne?
Sleep, why don't you sleep?
And take this cap off for God's sake.
I can't stand it.
Are we there?
No, we have a long way to go.
- Ozan! Ozan!
- Ozan!
- Ozan!
- Ozan!
Hi.
I can't believe that we
are talking to you now.
You're so cute.
So sweet.
I am your biggest and oldest fan!
If she's the oldest
she must be a senior student?
Can you sign my t-shirt?
Please.
- Please?
- OK.
- Me first!
- No, me!
Take it easy girls, take it easy. Easy.
I'll sign all of you, OK.
He's so sweet, isn't he?
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.
By the way, I'm sorry for your loss.
We are so sorry.
Are you alright?
Be alright, please.
Thank you guys.
Normally we wouldn't use this ferryboat,
When you got in the boat, so we…
We'll get out at the next stop and go back!
I want to eat you!
Girls, now off to school.
Come on, come on.
We love you so much!
Don't forget us!
Hey dude…
…what's up?
I am fine.
- Alright.
- Alright.
Alright.
Your solo album wasn't that good.
It was more like Grunge.
We are trying new stuff.
- Alright.
- Alright.
And you did wrong to the bass player.
You shouldn't fire him.
We didn't, he left the band.
- Alright.
- Alright.
Alright.
- Alright.
- Alright.
Alright.
Your fans,
don't seem like a fan of yours.
My single is a hit at the moment
and we can hear it on the radio.
We better listen to real music instead.
What about my song?
That's better.
- This is better.
- No, that is better!
This!
- That!
- This!
- That!
- This!
No, that is better!
What the hell are they doing?
Here you are.
I listen to.
Me too.
Me too…
Well then, do it.
Where the hell are they going to?
This follow-up thing is damn difficult,
I mean…
…if I get caught by the traffic light, …
I'm finished.
I mean if my car breaks down…
If my car breaks down!
My car better breaks down.
The road is empty.
I think, we'll arrive early.
We do some rehearsal when we're there.
You sing one or two of
your songs.
- Won't you sing?
- I'll play my father's keyboard.
Shouldn't we do this just like
the old days.
Didn't my father say so?
I think you forgot. I wasn't used to
sing either.
I build the stage, check the sound,
do music…
…and you get on stage and sing.
Everything is old school.
Everything is old school.
Oh no? They turned. Come on
Zeynep, come on. It's now or never.
Why did you chose that way?
I don't like highways.
Why don't you go the way everybody goes?
Then I'd be like everyone else.
You better don't be like everyone else
and be an asshole.
Ugh.. Alright.
How the hell will I make it break down?
I better pull this.
What if it won't get repaired?
I think the car broke down.
Let's have a look.
Everybody would think that
you were raised at the repair shop.
What will you do?
Will you serenade to the motor?
- The woman is stranded, shouldn't we stop?
- Did I tell we shouldn't stop?
Hi.
- Hope the worst is over.
- Thank you. I didn’t get what happened…
…the car malfunctioned and I had to
pull over. And no other car came along...
Oh my god, you are…
Aren't you mm...
Yes, we are. The albums didn't succeed
so we decided to do roadside assistance.
- Let's see what the problem is.
- Are you familiar with cars?
I spent all my childhood by trying
to make this car move.
I mean I am somehow familiar.
Start the engine.
Look at his poses. He acts like a mechanic just
because he tightened a couple of wheel nuts.
I don't understand what he's looking for,
as if he knows it
OK, leave it.
Yes.
The radiator didn't overheat.
Let's check this out.
No oil loss.
Spark plugs didn't get black.
The battery is OK.
Maybe there is something wrong
with the catalytic converter.
We better don't push you.
No need to take a risk.
We should bring it to a repairman. After
all, we didn't grow up in a workshop, did we?
- Do you have a tow rope?
- Well, may be in the trunk.
- Trunk?
- Yes, there.
- I know. It's locked.
- Sorry.
OK, I'll open it now.
- It's alright.
- Alright.
It didn't open.
Didn't it?
I'll try again.
There is a "clicking" thing there. If you go
under this "clicking" thing, it will open.
- Now my hand is there.
- It doesn't open.
- Should we count?
- We better count, OK we better count.
One.. two..
Three.
I didn't say three, but.
I didn't say three, which is why of course…
…there may be some small
communication problems. No worries.
Alright. I am so sorry. Alright.
- Should we count backwards?
- Beginning with three? Or with one?
Backwards. Like three, two, one.
OK, brilliant idea. Let's do it that way.
Three, two, one.
No.
Maybe there is another problem? The remote
control itself, maybe a connection...
- No, as a matter of fact...
- Can I take it?
And you leave the trunk handle.
Now open it.
Thank you.
Attach it to our car.
How the hell is she driving.
She will hit our car.
Slow!
Don't do zig zags.
What?
Slow! Slow!
Hold on! Slow!
- Don't do zig zags.
- What?
- Straight… hold the steering wheel straight.
- I can't hear you.
Go straight ahead!
Straight ahead!
Hold the steering wheel straight!
She doesn't hear.
She doesn't understand.
What the hell are you saying?
- Let's pull down and then you drive her car.
- There is a gas station ahead, let's go there.
And I need a pee.
It's obvious why the car broke down.
It revolted against its driver
and went on strike.
Come on, don't talk too much.
What happened?
Ozan has to do something
we'll sort it out.
It's just like a dream.
It doesn't make sense.
Why?
Why.. My car is breaking down, and two
famous musician are coming and helping.
It's a little unbelievable, huh?
Your car is great. Nostalgic.
They are rare, aren't they?
Yes, they are.
You own it for a long time, don't you?
I mean, you spent all your childhood
by repairing it.
It was my dad's car.
Mmm…
…by the way, I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
Here he comes.
- Now, give me the key.
- No, I drive.
- Don't bother.
- No way, like a private driver.
I got it, give it to me.
- Should I come here, he went there.
- Get in.
- Alright.
- Fasten your seat belt.
Master.
Look master.
- Sorry master!
- Kâmil! Bring the 14-15 wrench.
- Yes master.
- What the fuck is that?
The 14-15 wrench, master.
You told me to bring it.
Well, give it to me.
Master, the lady was stranded.
Let's see.
Open the hood.
It's there.
The latch is there.
I don't think it's the oil. There is
something wrong with the catalytic converter.
God give me patience.
Start the engine so we can hear its sound.
Maybe she shouldn't do it?
Start the engine.
Alright, alright. Leave it.
Is it alright?
Alright, alright. Don't start the engine.
Don't start the engine!
- Like this?
- Ok, leave it.
- Why did you step on the gas? Stop it, stop it!
- Should I step on the gas?
I can't understand.
Kâmil! Lift it!
Sorry. I am really sorry.
Are you OK?
No, not at all!
Sorry.
What is the problem with the car?
Could we figure it out?
It's you! You are the problem.
I tell you stop and you step on the gas.
You suffocated both the motor and me.
Well… Can you fix it until tonight?
Yes. I'll make a new one
in just five minutes.
Are you crazy, the motor burnt out.
It takes at least
a week or ten days.
Master, isn't our car finished yet?
It takes a week or ten days.
The unit of measure here
is a week or ten days I suppose.
You're wasting my time for two months
saying always a week or ten days.
The kid will be circumcised,
get the car done.
He is too young.
You can let him trim next year?
I think also we should wait, dad.
Shut up you dumbass.
It will be cut off, no way out.
- Master, do finish this car, I beg you.
- We'll see, we'll see.
- You will leave it here.
- I got it. You mean a week or ten days.
Bravo. You're a bad driver
but you have a quick mind.
Hello?
Zeynep, where are you?
I'm still on my way,
I couldn’t arrive… mom.
I'm not your mom.
Are you kidding me?
Get your ass over here,
you have some job to do. Come on.
You should know what I went through.
A really weird story.
I will tell it when I'm back, OK?
What the fuck are you doing there?
There is nobody to do the job.
Drag your ass here fast.
Alright, I got it. I am in Urla
for a couple of days. I will tell you.
- What the hell will you tell me?
- Alright mom?
- She's still saying mom.
- I love you too.
- Well then, bye. I kiss you.
- Zeynep...
My mom. She's a little apprehensive,
she calls me every minute.
By the way, thank you very much.
You didn't let me stranded.
You are also heading to Urla, by chance.
So? A gig or vacation?
I mean…
…something like that.
There are many stories in the newspapers
about you…
…they say that you don't talk each
other, etc. Such a lie. It's unbelievable.
No, it is true.
What the fuck is that?
It made me crazy since last night.
Take it easy man, you'll break it.
I don't care. I got pissed off,
it's opening again and again.
Turn it off.
- It doesn't.
- Then turn the stereo on.
- There's no tape inside.
- I think there is one.
What the hell is this tape?
Old wedding songs, I suppose.
Better than listening to white noise.
Put it and let's listen to it.
Whatzup you assholes?
If you are listening to this cassette, it
means you are in my boneshaker. Good boys.
That means you're going to the wedding
to play just like the good old days.
- You are going to a wedding to play?
- Sshh!
How is it going between you two?
Friends again? Huh?
Answer me assholes.
- Mmm…
- Well, not very...
You are really weird. I'm sure you're having
a hard time to answer my question. Huh?
I am dead, you hear me, dead.
So, be cool.
Listen to me. There is an envelope
in the trunk, under the spare tire.
You should give it to the woman
at the address you are going to, alright?
And the glove box cover is broken.
Get it fixed somewhere. See you.
It's better for you when
I don't see you soon.
He really did strive.
Records, etc.
Can I have an autograph please?
OK, I'll let you know when I'm back.
Yes, we cancel the gig tonight.
I shot the photo.
Great, great.
Tell them that I have sore throat, I am
sick. I don't know, fabricate something.
I am busy until the weekend.
- Get out. People are looking at us? Get out!
- I don't care?
Fasten your seat belt.
She is pretty.
But a little weird.
What is weird?
Normally she should hit on me.
I mean it's always like that.
Yeah.. It's always like that.
But I didn't take a liking to her.
As a matter of fact she seems into you.
Interesting.
Shut up.
She will hear it.
- She won't, take it easy.
- What if she will…
I'll fix you up with her.
- Trust me.
- You better drive your car. Don't make me sick.
- I will.
- Drive your car.
- Alright, I will.
- Drive your car. Don't make me shout.
- She will hear it.
- I'll fix you up with her.
- Ozan…
- Do you love her?
If you love her, you will shout it out.
You will go, you will move.
- You're cruisin' for a bruisin'.
- Yes I am…
…but you love her.
I'll do it, I'm on it. Finished.
- How the hell are you talking?
- Take it easy.
I will tell her that you love her.
He loves you but he's shy,
he cannot express himself.
Shut up. What is your problem?
I told you shut up.
"You're on fire, you
are burning with desire"
"Don't know whether it's good or not"
Why are you laughing, you dumbass? Give me
the lemon. Look, what happened to my hair.
Give it to me.
Give. Squeeze it, squeeze it.
Bravo. Ok.
- Dad, a car is coming.
- Let it come. What should I do?
If you go on like this,
you'll see it in the fire.
You love her.
- Dad, the guy doesn't look at the road.
- So what, Squeeze it.
- You love her.
- Look in front of you.
Look in front of you!
Put on the brakes!
Bravo.
Bravo! Now you are literally on fire!
Are you alright?
Buddy? He is living.
My buddy.
You're also OK my son.
Are the instruments OK?
They are broken.
Are they broken? God damn you…
I wish you were broken instead!
Are you alright?
Are you alright buddy?
Tato, look my instrument is broken,
it was a heirloom.
Did you break it?
God damn you, you should break yourself!
Get up, get up, get up.
Alright, don't get up.
His hand is cut off.
His hand is cut off.
Are you OK?
He is not OK either. None of them is OK.
What about the car?
I'm OK.
What the hell are you doing?!
What are you doing?
You destroyed the car.
Is this the way how to drive?
You should push it more
and put it in my mouth!
Excuse me buddy. It's an accident.
You appeared before us.
How can I excuse you?
You are % 100 guilty.
Look what happened to his mouth?
All the musicians dropped like flies.
They are all destroyed.
- What do I do now?
- Alright bro, alright.
Give me your phone number.
I will compensate your loss.
Yeah, I'll give my number, write it down.
Zero.
- Zero.
- Yes, you can call me from that number.
How will you compensate it? Look, the guy is
looking that way but seeing the other way.
Look at this guy, his hands are cut off.
He used to play keyboard.
Should he play the keyboard with his mouth.
What do we do now? There is a wedding.
Do you have any musician friends or something?
I will compensate both side's losses.
Let me think a second…
No! Do I look like a culture center?
Look at these weirdos, I hardly found them.
Where will I find new guys?
All of them dropped like flies. They
were an orchestra. What will do they play?
What will I do now?
- The guy plays keyboard, his hands...
- Dad!
- Why are you yelling you son of a bitch?
- I know them, they are also musicians.
Are you musicians?
What?
I can't believe. I can't believe.
Look at our situation we are in now.
Look at this.
It's my fault.
It's my fault, brother.
Why on earth are you riding
with this idiot?
Well you did that, but why do you
let him to drive?
I told you we should take the highway.
But, no He doesn't go the
way everybody goes? Showoff.
You are a showoff.
It's not me who comes to his dad's funeral
with an army of reporters.
Right.
You don't become a showoff when you
beat the reporters and break the cameras.
Because off your punch on my face
I couldn't go on stage for two months!
You deserved it.
You resent because the people like me
more than you, huh?
- Be careful with what you're saying.
- What happens if I won't?
You're gonna get hurt. I mean seriously
I can break your nose.
I couldn't stop.
What are you doing?
- What's so funny? Is this a fucking tv show?
- Come on dad.
Don't call me dad, fuck off!
You fuck off too. Fuck off.
Fuck off!
Damn villagers.
Tonight make them dance like crazy,
kill them, demolish them.
Make them cry by making them dance,
alright? Come on…
What is wrong with him?
Nothing, are the instruments ready?
Yeah, they are ready. You broke the
half of them. Now we are gluing them.
We will also glue the men,
they will come, I hope.
He asks me, are they ready.
Yes… Good night to everybody.
Thanks.
Thank you.
There you are.
One.. two.. three.. four..
- Too low for me.
- What?
- I say, the tone.
- I don't understand.
The tone is too low, how can I sing it?
Should I sing from my ass?
Sing in dad's tone.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Wow. Who would have said that
the anti-pop Hakan...
would play keyboard in a wedding.
- Hello.
- Hello Zeynep, why don't you pick up the phone?
- Where are you?
- In a village whose name I don't know.
Like I told you,
I am after a weird story.
In the village? What are all this noises?
Tell me the truth, where are you?
You see, I'm in a village.
We sent you to the funeral, and you are
wandering around, god knows where.
Now I am in a wedding.
I am with them.
I found a really strange story.
I am talking about something human.
This story is too good for a tabloid,
do you understand me?
How the hell you know
what is good or not?
Well, then send a prove. How should I know
that you are telling the truth?
OK, I'll send a prove.
I'll send a photo for you.
But that's all. Don't show it to anybody.
Maybe only to the boss.
But you won't publish
or show it anywhere.
Do you understand me?
Promise me.
What happened? Is the wedding finished?
No, I just wanted to have a break.
- Who is playing the keyboard?
- My father.
What?
I put on some of his old wedding songs
they are playing now.
Your father was a
wedding singer, wasn't he?
Yes.
We travelled everywhere.
You know this boneshaker you paid
forcedly a compliment for…
…we spent our whole life with it.
And what about your mom?
Wasn't she angry?
Was it not hard, when your dad brought
you to weddings?
I didn't have enough time with her to know
what makes her angry.
I was five years old when my mom died.
I can barely remember her face.
Ozan can not remember even that.
Just from the photos.
I didn't leave my room after mom died.
I remember that I cried for days.
My dad waited until I was silence.
Then he came and said to me…
…you grew up today.
And I gave up being a child.
Ozan remained as a child.
It's obvious. Look, he
seems really enjoying.
Ozan was always like that.
He was the one who had the most fun
in the weddings we played.
And what about you?
And I was like that.
Did you ever think letting yourself go?
Did you ever try something like that?
I mean, if I were you…
…I wouldn't gave up so quickly
being a child.
You just have one life on earth.
You live this moment only once.
We are here for only one time.
I mean, you should behave
the way you feel.
Really.
What was that poem…
…A man should jump into the unthinkingly.
Like diving from a rock
into an emerald sea.
Do you know this poem?
There is something I learned from
what I wrote.
- Bro Ozan.
- Yes?
- You know your last girl friend, the model.
- So what?
Does she have a sister?
What's up?
If she has a sister, arrange her for me.
She's very pretty.
If she has a sister,
she's also very pretty for sure.
We split up last week.
Now she doesn't want to talk to me.
If I knew that, I'd definitely arrange her.
What did you do to her?
You are such a lady's man.
If you make up, don't forget me.
Of course.
He split up, asshole.
- Ozan, can you please sign this?
- Sure.
What should I write?
Thank you.
What are you doing here?
Nothing. I'm getting an autograph
from Ozan. It's none of your business?
- Give it to me.
- I won't give it.
I told you, give it to me!
Remember…
…me…
…whenever…
…you wear this.
Fevziye.
Fevziye.
Honestly, I didn't know.
How can you dare to sign my fiancee's
underpants, you asshole?
Tell me.
How can you dare?
- Stop, you misunderstood me.
- I kill you, you asshole.
- Don't be a smart ass.
- Cut that out.
Who the fuck do you think
you are pushing my arm?
- What's up?
- What's up with you?
"…a man should jump
into life unthinkingly."
"Like diving from a rock
into an emerald sea."
Move aside!
What the hell are you doing?
You screwed up the wedding.
They're beating the boss, come on!
Did it break? Did anything break?
I'll finish you asshole.
- Are you alright?
- Yes.
Duck! Duck! Duck!
Look at the bride.
Come on! Come on!
Get going!
Where is this son of a bitch?
Where is this son of a bitch?
Oh my god, reinforcement is coming.
Dad!
What the fuck?
Things are getting crazy.
Bust a move!
Süsük bust a move! Süsük!
I fucking got you.
What are you doing?
- We're leaving, come on.
- Where are we going?
To Mexico. To the
village of course, hurry up.
Come on.
Ozan, you go now, I'm coming.
What will you do?
I'm coming with you.
Take Zeynep and go.
Come on.
Now I'll finish you.
Where has he been?
I'm going back, wait here for me.
There is something I learned
from what I wrote.
When you hug your friend
you should hug him so tight.
They are coming!
They are coming!
Come on!
You should fight with all your
muscles, body and passion.
And when you lie down on the warm sand,
You should rest like a grain of sand...
like a leaf or like a stone.
Did you dive into the crowd
just to get the keyboard?
After all, it's an heirloom. It survived so
many fights, how could I leave it there?
You are really crazy. Does it make sense
to fight the whole village?
Doesn't it?
In fact it doesn't.
Does it make sense to go back
for the keyboard?
In fact, it doesn't.
My lads.
How are you doing?
Very good. From now on,
you can call me your "Tato".
What the fuck is "Tato"?
Something like a manager, but
has nothing to do with art or whatsoever.
You played very well at the wedding,
very well..
I love you guys.
OK, we ask now for permission.
Of course, let's go,
now we're going to our place.
No, we are leaving.
It's just two kilometers, my…
Well, let's go.
I think we can go.
Sure, sure. If you encounter a wild animal
you demolish the car.
- Let's go.
- Come on.
Alright then.
Ssshh Ozan, I have request from you.
Me and my wife have a
very special song.
She becomes very sentimental when she
hears it, do you understand me?
Now when we are in our village,
can you please sing this song?
We are on the outs, so we can
get back together, you understand?
- Of course I can sing?
- Really?
My lad.
I love you guys.
Come on.
They didn't let the lovers
come together, come together
My lady with beautiful eyes, nice words
They were jealous, so jealous?
I can not live without her
My eyes and my heart are looking for you
Dad and mom don't allow
Dear mother in love,
what have you done to us
We love each other so much
and run away
Tato, did you fight again?
God damn you.
That's enough.
Come inside.
My wife went mad again.
Come on.
What are you doing on the roof?
I'm looking at the stars.
Come here.
Come, there is a ladder behind.
Welcome.
- And this is my place.
- Place.
Very nice.
Can you see that?
- Which one?
- That one.
- This.
- This is the north star.
They say that the earth and all the stars
are connected to that star.
Why is that?
Maybe…
…it's the only one which can carry
so much burden.
Very beautiful, isn't it?
It is.
You are the same indeed.
- How come?
- The same.
Both close, but at the same time far away.
Do I look that way?
Yes.
I came to see you,
I mean listen to you.
Then I thought the same way.
You are singing as if there's nobody
around you.
I tried the whole night to catch
your eyes.
It's so weird.
You always sing with your eyes closed.
As if you get lost inside it.
- Then it was a crying shame.
- Why?
If I'd opened my eyes,
maybe I might have meet you earlier.
- It's a bit cold here.
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is cold. Take this.
- No, I didn't say for it.
- No, really take this. You should take it.
- Alright. Alright.
Take it.
Now off with you.
Sshh. Don't hit other people's cars.
Not everybody is as tolerant as I am.
Don't worry, this time
I will drive.
Off with you.
Off with you.
Come on.
Come on.
Don't forget to fix my stuff.
I beg you, don't forget it.
Vineyards and orchards.
I will possess all of this.
- You will also get your share.
- OK, don't worry. I'm on it.
Hello.
Where are you?
What happened?
I'm telling the people that you are sick,
can not go on stage, …
…the next day you we hear the news about
you being on stage at a village wedding.
And a banknote glued on your forehead.
The organisation's lawyer called now, …
…they will put the compensation
provision in process.
How come? What news?
I sent an e-mail to you. If you don't
come tomorrow and make the gig…
…they will make us pay a big compensation.
You have to came back immediately.
OK, I will call you.
- Brother, pull over for a minute.
- What happened?
Pull over, I will tell you.
Buddy, is there something serious?
Somebody…
…took my photo at the wedding and sent it to
the newspapers. I'm hitting the headlines now.
And they wrote beneath the picture…
…"He said he was sick,
but played at a wedding".
OK buddy, is this your concern?
After two days they will forget it.
How will they forget it. Look, I
became trending topic in an instant.
Let's say that the news is forgotten.
The ad-company, which is
my sponsor organized this gig.
If I don't get on stage tomorrow,
I will pay tons of money.
Gigs, ads, etc..
I have make a couple of calls, brother.
I don't understand, how this photo
arrives the newspaper from the village?
I don't know.
I mean… I didn't understand. I don't know.
Is the situation that bat?
I guess so.
I have to answer this.
Hello, Zeynep. How are you?
You said, you won't publish this photo.
I told you not to show anybody
but the boss.
The boss said
"Everybody should see it but me".
You won't get any more photos.
That was enough already. You have all the
time. I'm looking forward to your story.
Alright, I understand.
Is there any news?
If I don't get on stage tomorrow
they will sue me.
Oh no.
We can go back, if you want.
At the very time
everything was like before.
Everything is like before already.
Don't worry, I'm with you.
You lied to me when you said that,
you don't like highways, didn't you?
Dad used to like that way.
Therefore you chose that road.
Do you remember…
…we both wanted to sit in the front seat
when we were kids.
But dad made us sit in the back seats.
And then there was another fight
for sitting, on the left or right side.
Yes.
You know, I miss these old days
so much.
Me too.
And…
- …the things I told you yesterday…
- Forget about it.
- I can't, brother.
- Forget about it.
You will listen to me.
After mom died, you pulled us together.
Even my father.
You never thought of yourself.
And me…although I seem just the opposite…
…I did everything to make you happy.
You forgot this.
- Mustache comb.
- Yes.
What do we do?
Are we going back?
No.
We will play and sing together at that
wedding just like the good old days.
- Exactly.
- Exactly.
But…
it will cost me a fortune to sing
at that wedding…
…so be it.
We sold also some records.
- We'll help you with the compensation.
- No, brother.
The money you get for your records
will be hardly enough for the gas.
How come? Come here!
Hold on!
- Get in.
- Everything is OK?
Yep. Come on, get in.
What happened?
Engine doesn't crank.
I think the battery is empty.
Have a nice trip lady.
You exceeded the speed limit.
And the front bumper is ready to fall down.
Your driver licence and registration please.
Officer, that's not possible
because this car can't do more than 80.
That means it exceeds 60. Your
driver licence and registration please.
Alright Zeynep, alright. The officer
should fine and we hit our road.
Well then, can you give my bag
from the back seat?
- Where is the registration?
- It should be under the sun shield.
Dad always put it there.
There is another tape here.
Oh my. Another one?
Put it.
Bravo, you didn't forget the place
I put the registration.
This time I won't tell you about
the will or inheritage.
I recorded this tape for another reason.
You know, I've never been a man
showing his emotions.
Ozan…
…do you remember the day you
burnt the carpet, I smacked you.
You cried so much. Mom wouldn't
smack me if she was alive.
Maybe you don't remember, but
I never forgot that moment.
Since that day I always saw you mom
whenever I looked at your face.
And this slap always hit me
on the face.
I am sorry.
Hakan…
…do you remember, after your mom died…
…I told you "You grew up today, and you are
responsible for your younger brother"…
…at that time I laid the burden of
the whole life on your shoulders.
But you were just a kid my son.
I am sorry.
As I told you, I couldn't show my feelings.
But I wanted you know
how much I love you.
By the way..
The vehicle inspection is missing.
I didn't get it done,
because I had one foot in the grave.
Take care of it sometime.
Honestly, we didn't know.
It was a little bit tiring, but…
…we finally made it, I suppose.
We can give you a lift before we're
heading to Urla.
OK.
You can also come to
the wedding, if you want.
Really, can I come?
I don't know, if there's nobody
waiting for you.
Nope.
Your family, your boyfriend…
Are you going alone to Urla?
Yes.
What do you think?
Should she come with us?
OK.
Come on.
-My lady
-Of course.
Thank you.
Mmm, the table is…
…a little low, so...
Excuse me.
Our table is low, yes.
What are you doing?
It's very late, and I...
…better go.
- No, it's not late.
- No, no… I better go.
- Good night to two of you.
- Good night.
God damn…
You handle the bill,
and I will do it… OK?
Ah Ozan.. He is right,
he's tired the whole day.
I mean, yeah…
…the trip was a bit tiring.
Yes.
- I mean.
- You mean.
- So what…
- I mean yes.
You are also tired for sure.
- No, I'm not.
- I never get tired.
- Aren't you tired?
- No, I'm not.
Should we walk?
Walk?
We can walk.
I can always walk.
Me too.
- Let's walk.
- Let's walk.
- You made all the village chase us.
- Me?
Of course you, was it me?
Thanks to our experience with weddings.
I will you something…
…shall we go on the pier?
- I think we better not.
- What happened, are you scared?
- Of course no.
- Come on, I can lead if you want.
Give me your hand.
Slowly, slowly. Be careful.
Zeynep…
Dolphins. Did you see the dolphins?
They are so beautiful, look at them.
What about dolphins.
- Where are they?
- There.
- Where?
- You can't see them from there.
Look, there.
Did you?
Yes, that one.
I saw it.
Very nice.
Dou you know what I wanted to be
when I was a child?
- I know.
- What?
I don't know.
A dolphin.
A dolphin.
Think about it, all seas belong to you.
You can go anywhere whenever you want.
I think this is a very liberating feeling.
Very sweet.
Are you kidding me?
No way. Why should I?
A story came into my mind.
My dad used to tell it to me.
This is the story of a fisherman.
Once upon a time there was a fisherman…
…there was a woman.
More precisely a girl, a mermaid.
When the fisherman went fishing
the mermaid always came near him and sang.
She sang him with the most
beautiful voice of the seven seas.
One day he told her "Give me your hand
and take me to the deeps of the sea".
And the mermaid gave him her hand...
Can I say something to you?
You are a bad storyteller.
I know.
- Now I have to tell you something.
- Now?
Now.
There is somebody.
No.
No, there is no such thing.
There is nobody.
Then.
We were in the thick of the story.
Mermaid.
- Good luck with it?
- What?
- I say, good luck with it.
- What the fuck are you talking about.
My father is not there,
but I'm here, brother.
- Don't talk nonsense.
- I'll go and get her for you.
- You gonna get who?
- Your girl idiot, who else?
You became really interesting.
- I'm going now.
- Where are you going?
To the wedding house
dad told us.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hello.
- We are here for the wedding tonight.
What wedding?
There is no wedding here.
Is this not Ayşe Yılmaz's house?
- Yes, I'm her mother.
- They told us that there's a wedding tonight.
No, my son, there is no wedding here.
You came to a wrong place.
Erkan Demir sent us.
He told that you spoke
to my father.
- Your father?
- Yes.
Are you the children of Erkan?
Yes.
Look… my dad passed away a few days ago.
His last wish was that we play at that
wedding. And he wanted us to give this.
Did Erkan die?
I met Erkan 20 years ago.
He came here to play in a hotel.
And I was singing back then.
That summer we got on stage together.
Then he went back… To Istanbul.
We didn't see each other.
I mean, I didn't want to
see him again.
You are Erkan's children, huh?
Yep. Yes, but…
…he sent us to play
at your daughter's wedding.
In fact, the…
…reason I called him was not the wedding.
What do you mean with not the wedding. I
fucking cancelled my gig for this concert.
- I called him for our daughter.
- Sorry?
Your daughter?
- Yes.
- Hang on, hang on, what daughter?
The daughter of me and Erkan.
Ayşe.
Until the last two weeks
Erkan didn't know this either.
But I was really desperate.
- I had to call him, the doctor…
- Are you serious?
That means we have a step sister?
Are you fucking kidding us?
How can you do that?
You see all the shit that he has done.
Brother, I'm going back.
It's impossible that he sent us
just to tell us that he has a daughter.
There must be another reason.
The woman said that she was desperate.
What can be the reason?
She called to ask for money
after she learned who we are.
He made a fool of us.
- Keep calm.
- How can I keep calm?
- How can you keep calm?
- I don't know, but take it easy!
Alright. OK, let him go
he should be calm.
- How are you?
- I don't know.
I bought a ticket for tonight's flight.
If I leave know I can
catch up with the gig.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am. I don't want another
sibling after this age.
I don't want this boneshaker either.
Take the key, you can keep it.
Will you see that girl?
Dad told that we can watch the rest of
the video after we came to the address.
What do you expect him to say?
Will he say "20 years ago I did…
…something wrong and
you have a sister take care of her"?
His whole life he didn't face anything,
he always ran away.
It's easy to talk as long as you're
on some video or tape.
He should have said so it on time.
And then he would have answered us.
Goodbye.
You won't take responsibility
just for once, will you?
You'll run away as always.
As if you didn't run away?
You didn't run away from responsibilities
but you ran away from the people.
You went underground,
just like a mouse.
You hated me every day
in your small, dark world.
Be careful with what you're saying.
Is that wrong?
Didn't you show every
favour you did to my face?
Maybe you didn't tell…
…but you always made me feel
like a burden on your shoulder.
You were more than a burden in my life.
You were a fool, spoilt, self-centered
selfish.
Do you know why I put up with you?
Just because of mom's memory.
Right.
Right, she was only your mom.
Only you had the right for
feeling sad for her, huh?
What happened?
Don't try to act as if you my brother just
because we had a couple of good days together.
Go.
Go away from here.
And don't ever confront me again.
I don't have such intention.
I wish you happiness with your new sister.
Hakan.
Tell your girl friend…
…the next time she wants to make
news about me…
…she should get an appointment.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about Zeynep.
She is the reporter of the newspaper
which published my picture in the village.
My manager sent me a message.
Just for a moment I thought that
somebody can really love you?
But it seems that, this is too much
for a person like you.
Now you got rid of the burden in your life.
- Where are we heading?
- To the airport.
Is it true?
- Did I give you enough material?
- Hakan…
Shut up.
I fucking believed in you.
I believed in you.
You deceived me.
All this north stars, dolphins..
Were they all a lie?
You do this to everybody, don't you?
Hakan, I swear to god
I wouldn't publish there photos.
I swear, I wanted to tell you.
I couldn't. Please…
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
Or touch me, come on.
You can even kiss me, if you want.
What do you think?
Don't you do the same to everyone?
Don't you do your business that way?
By seducing other people.
OK sir, don't worry
he will be there on time.
I told you they should be there
at 3 o'clock?
No, why don't you listen to me?
I said 3 o'clock.
It's not possible,
we can not succeed that way.
30 minutes before the stage.
Mr. Ozan, do you want anything?
Your dad wanted you to watch this video…
…when you didn't call me on time.
20 minutes before the stage.
I know, you are angry to me.
You are right.
You thought that I sent you to a wedding…
…and it came out that you have sister.
I also didn't know until last month
that I have a daughter.
That was 18-20 years ago…
…a couple of years after your mom died,
and I was pulling myself together.
There was a summer job around İzmir.
I was supposed to sing in hotels.
And you both were very young.
I brought you to our relatives,
and I went there.
I met Ayşe's mother back then.
I told her that I will call her
when I'm back in Istanbul…
…but I didn't.
After 20 years she called me.
I wouldn't call you
if you weren't my last hope.
This girl, I mean our daughter,
your sister Ayşe is sick.
She had marrow cancer.
The doctors said that
it's highly possible...
that the tissues of a family member
will be compatible.
I know that you are wondering,
why I am telling you this like that.
I'm sure you wonder why I didn't talk
face to face.
I thought that if it would be a man's
last wish you wouldn't object to it.
Kids, help this girl.
Just so you know, whether you
fulfill my will or not…
…you are…
…the most preocious things
I left behind.
I commend you to each other.
Goodbye.
That was a good speech.
It hurts deeply.
Really touching.
So, what will you do?
Mr. Ozan, 30 seconds before stage.
Dear passengers, the bus to Istanbul
is ready to leave.
- Hello.
- What did you do? Is the story finished yet?
- You won't get any story.
- What do you mean?
- What are you doing there?
- I gave up writing.
I was curious when I couldn't
hear anything from you.
I sent Cem there. He will
finish the job you started.
Did you sent Cem?
Where did you sent him?
I didn't tell you where I was.
I am working as a journalist
since you were born.
Come my daughter.
Slowly, slowly.
- Hikmet, can you please give me a hand.
- Alright.
Slow. Slowly mom, stop.
Stop.
Thanks Hikmet.
Give it to me.
- Hikmet, take this too.
- Not to mention, she is like a daughter to me.
- Hikmet, you will take it?
- There's no need for it.
Hikmet, wil you take it?
Thank you.
Come my daughter.
Stop, stop. I will do it. Stop.
Stop.
My pretty girl.
What did the doctors say…
…when the progression of the disease stops…
…we will discontinue the medication.
Then I will caress and com my pretty
girl's hair like before.
- I am tired mom, I better sleep.
- Come on darling, come on.
Slowly.
Slowly.
Why did you come back?
I heard everything.
I am very sorry,
without having listened to you…
Ayşe.
Ayşe.
My girl.
Mom.
We are here standing guard for hours,
her ladyship just arrives.
- Give it to me.
- What are you doing?
- Give it to me… Give it to me!
- No.
- What are you doing, are you crazy?
- Hold on for a second.
- Have you lost your mind?
- Ok, buddy, hold on.
Here. There is no news here, OK?
Now leave.
Do you have any idea what you did?
You just deleted my future carrier.
Yes I have.
You can tell when you're back there.
They're out.
Hold on! Look, look at me. Listen to me.
I will tell you something.
This is really important, OK? Maybe the
newspaper will sell well for two days…
…but afterwards nobody will remember that,
not me, not you, do you understand me?
Only they will remember that.
Do you understand me?
Look, this is very important.
Please don't do that.
You're doing that, because
the girl is sick, aren't you?
What?
I've made a small investigation…
…the girl has marrow cancer.
She is waiting for a donor for a long time.
So be it.
I'm going, are you coming with me?
Come on.
Come, slowly.
Doctor, when will you get
the test results?
If it would be a general scanning,
it could have last months.
But we will give priority to your specimen
because you are relatives.
Still it may take a couple of days.
For such a short time we don't need to keep
a close watch on our patient.
You can take her home if you want.
Are you alright?
Ayşe, I will be in a hotel nearby.
You already know my number,
you can call me in case of emergency.
No need for a hotel,
you can stay here.
No, I better go.
I make your room ready.
Doctor, how are the test results?
I mean, can I be a donor?
At first I have to say that, even in
the first degree relatives it's not easy…
…to find a fully compatible tissue.
But we won't lose our hope.
We will continue with general scans.
In some cases, it's also possible
to find it abroad.
But this is a long process.
Ayşe…
…don't be sad.
You heard the doctor.
Even if not now, they sure will
found someone.
I think we found the compatible tissue.
- I beg your pardon?
- How come?
The first test results just arrived.
According to that,
the tissue is fully compatible.
- Mom.
- My girl.
My girl, you will recover.
And who is the donor?
- Ozan?
- Brother.
I know…
…It was selfish of me to leave.
Maybe we are her last hope.
And she is our last hope to become
a family again.
My brother.
Come on.
Ayşe.
This is your younger brother.
Sometimes your mind just stops…
…and doesn't recover for a long time.
- You have to manage it somehow.
- Thanks.
Thanks guys, thanks.
Something like that.
We go after one measure of drum fill.
That was good.
Continue, I'm coming.
- Brother.
- Ayşe.
You are coming tonight, aren't you?
Mom cooked many meals.
If you don't come I should eat all of them.
If your Brother Ozan comes, so do we.
You already know your brother Ozan,
he is late as always.
Alright. I talked with Brother Ozan, …
…in your next gig, we will
watch you in the first row. OK?
- OK. Great.
- Goodbye.
Hi.
Hi.
The lady was stranded…
…her car is in the workshop
for a week or ten days.
Did you ask the lady…
…whether she's going for vacation or
for business?
- She says… that…
- Can you tell the gentleman…
…the lady isn't going
for business anymore.
It's none of my business?
You better tell each other. Gosh.
It's my fault. Why do you waste your time
for these stubborn goats?
Well then…
…we should not let the lady down.
I agree.
Guys, I have a very
big surprise for you.
- Now?
- Yes, now.
- Come with me, let me show it.
- It's high time.
- Fucking awesome.
- What is fucking awesome?
I can't tell, I can't tell.
So fucking amazing.
- Where are we going?
- Come, come.
I cancelled the flight,
we will drive this beauty.
How come?
- Come on.
- So beautiful.
How does it look?
Oh my god... great colour.
- Fucking amazing, huh?
- Fucking beautiful.
Buddy, did you check the car's
inside?
There is no tape, or video
or whatsoever I hope?
The guys in the workshop told me that
they found a locked box, …
- …with mother of pearl inlaid.
- What?
I'm joking.. I'm joking.
Look the car looks amazing.
- It's a real beauty.
- But we need a finishing coat.
And I'm leaving it…
…to you.
"THANKS TO DAD"
