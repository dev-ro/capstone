I hope you all have recovered
from the shock of the accident?
Yes.
"Then let's talk business, okay?"
Your sister and your brother-in-law
got this will made...
which I want you to understand.
Your brother-in-law owned a house
and a factory of readymade garments.
It goes to his three
children after his death.
Now since the children
are still not old enough...
you'll have to take
care of this property.
And till such time as
the children come of age...
you will have to handle
the entire business.
"But how will I do all this, Sir?"
You know very well that
I've left my studies behind.
I haven't even got to
know the children well.
How will I handle this?
- Don't worry about that.
I've got a trained man from Japan
who will help you out with this.
Come to my office tomorrow at 10 am.
I'll introduce you to him. Okay?
Tell me how are you making
it out with the kids?
They've been pampered a lot...
but... they're okay.
"Come here, Sunny."
Haven't you heard me?
No! Help!
- What happened?
These children are the limit!
Run... run!
- Where you people going?
To hell!
We will not work here!
"Children will be naughty, you see.
Please come..."
"Kids, my foot! They're devils!
We just don't want to work here!"
Let's go!
What's going on?
Who did all this?
I asked who did this!
And what's that on your face?
Take it off!
Answer me;
who did all this?
"So, you're finding it funny, eh?"
Get down now and
straighten the sofa.
"Now sit down, all of you.
I want to talk to you."
When I walked in just now...
I saw the fifth servant and
the third cook fleeing the house.
Sit properly.
Put your feet down.
No servant is prepared to work here.
Because of the way you are!
Listen...
"I'm not only your uncle now,
but your father too."
Oh no!
You can't be our Daddy!
I know I can't be your father...
but I love you as much
as your parents did.
That's a lie! You can't give us
that much of love!
"What you call the Hanging Garden,
is actually the Kamala Nehru Park."
Do you know who Kamala was?
- No.
"She was the wife of the first Prime
Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru."
She was born in
the year 1899 and...
she passed away in 1936.
This park was dedicated
to her memory.
"Hey, Sunny...! Where are you going?
What happened?"
What happened?
- Why do you talk of the dead?
Okay then; let's go to the museum.
- What's a museum?
You find old things exhibited there.
The dead...
Not the museum.
Let's go to a music show!
"Sunny, Munni and Vicky,
wherever you are..."
please come to the stage
your uncle is waiting for you.
You're really a strange man!
You should have joined them...
when they went to the toilet.
We would have been saved the bother!
"I'm sorry, but...
- No ~buts' now..."
hurry to the police station
and lodge a complaint.
"You won't find them here, will you?
- Okay. But keep them here,"
"if they happen to come here.
- Okay, I will. But please go."
You really look like the Gods.
The art you possess!
The elegant movements
of your lithe body!
Today is the biggest and the
most wonderful day of my life!
I have at last performed with an
internationally acclaimed artist!
You are a big artist
in your own right.
"Despite being a businessman, you show
a rare interest in art. Wonderful!"
Oh no! You shouldn't be saying that!
"Come here, Vyjayanti."
"Meet her...
My daughter, Vyjayanti."
"Just as the father's talented,
the daughter's beautiful, too."
"Why are you standing so far away?
Come here, closer to me."
Can't you speak without using your
hands? The programme is over!
Your daughter is
very jovial.
"Are you an artist, too, dear?"
Yes.
I've learnt Karate.
"Come with me, Vyjayanti!"
What did you say to him?!
"I'm fed up of meeting your
so-called big people, father!"
"I want to meet some
ordinary people, too."
I want to lead an ordinary life.
- Shut up!
Go sit in the car. Go!
"Your breakfast is ready, children."
"This one's snapped now, Uncle."
Give it to me...
Now turn around.
"Where's my breakfast, uncle?
- On the table; where else can it be?"
What are you laughing for?
You'll get a slap!
What mischief are you upto?
Sit down!
Look Vicky! A fair!
"Take us to the fair, uncle!
Please take us, uncle!"
No! You won't go there!
"If you promise to behave yourself,
I'll take you there this evening."
I'll leave now; Take the
School Bus home this evening.
Uncle... come here.
Bend a little.
What's up? You seem to be
overflowing with love!
"Darling, give me a kiss too!"
You're here?
- It's very true that you get...
"what you want, if you want it
from the bottom of your heart."
Or you wouldn't have met me
here on the streets of Bombay!
Maya's an old friend
from my college.
Send them away and let's go
have some coffee somewhere.
Not today; I'm busy.
Perhaps some other day.
That day of yours will never come!
Come with me...
"There's not much of a difference
between you and the kids, eh Maya?"
You'd discover the ~difference'
when you meet me alone.
I'll be off now; see you soon!
- How will we meet?
Give me your address
or your telephone number.
I can't remember
the telephone number.
Where was the need to give
her the telephone number?
"She's an old friend, right?
- Shut up!"
Go in now.
"So I'm leaving, then."
Here is he.
- Is he the one?
I'm sorry for the delay. I had
to drop the children at school.
That's okay... let me
introduce you to Mr Mishra.
That will be enough.
But you can call me ~B.P.'
I'll call you Mr Mishra.
"But please call me Mr Mishra, J. R..."
You have the whole of
the day for yourselves.
You can decide later as to
what you'll call each other.
"Speak in Hindi, Mr Mishra.
Use less of English."
Show Mr Rahul all the work
related to the factory.
Don't worry!
I'll show him everything!
Please take care.
This is great!
This is simply wonderful!
We've never had such a
smart-Iooking boss earlier!
I'm simply bowled over!
Are you married?
- What? Oh no!
Are you involved with someone?
Why are you so worried?
You're already married.
"But I have a sister, don't I?"
Shut up!
Give our new boss some respect!
Please don't misbehave!
The telephone!
I'll attend to it.
Who's that?
- This is Bignani here.
Excuse me...
It's Mr Bignani for you...
he's the same one who's given us
an order for shirts. Speak to him.
This is Rahul Malhotra speaking.
What can I do for you?
Have you gone crazy?
What you can do indeed!
"Will I have to tell
you that, too?!"
You've kept my order with you
hanging for 3 months now.
What about that?
When will that be executed?
"I've got a right to know, right?"
I've taken over only today.
I'll let you know by tomorrow.
Why tomorrow? That's the problem
with the new generation!
You've all become shirkers!
Look at me! I work till late in
the night. Meet me today. Today!
Okay. I'll drop in today.
- Now you understand!
Meet me at the Chembur
Club at 6 this evening!
Look what I've got for you.
"Don't you find a change, uncle?"
"Yes, I do. Nothing's broken, neither
are you fighting among yourselves."
"You're forgetting something, uncle."
What is that?
- You promised us that...
"if we behave,
you'd take us to fair."
"Yes, I had said that.
But there is a problem."
What?!
I have a business meeting...
- So?
It's important for me to attend that.
- But you had promised us.
"I agree I had promised you, but...
- You're breaking your promise!"
I'll take you all to
the fair tomorrow.
Now quietly eat your food.
I don't want any noise. Okay?
"Food, my foot!"
What's going on?
What's this nonsense?
"If you can go back on your word,
we can break our promise, too!"
Give that to me! Impertinent rascals!
Go to your rooms!
Go in!
You'll be locked in your room.
That's your punishment!
You are standing here?
And I am searching for you there!
"It's so much fun here
in the party, isn't it?"
I am getting bored.
One does feel suffocated
in such parties.
It's so pleasant here outside!
Were you born in the train?
- Why do you ask?
You aren't able to talk
without shaking?
Shall I ask you something?
- What do you want to ask?
Do you like Europe or America?
- Why?
"After all, we will have to decide
where we will go for honeymoon."
Whose honeymoon?
Ours... I mean... yours and mine.
We will be getting married.
We will be celebrating our honeymoon.
Now don't you feel shy!
Who told you that I will
marry you?
Your father did.
- Father said!
Father said that?
- Yes.
Father!
What's this?
- What is it?
How could you fix my marriage?
You are of a marriageable age now.
So I fixed your marriage!
That's fine. But I will not marry
this cartoon.
Why not?
"He's young, he's famous.
Moreover, he's an lyer."
He's perfect for you!
Every limb of his body is crooked.
Like a camel!
"If you interrupt, I will
dump you in the swimming pool!"
I will not marry him.
It's him you will marry!
- Impossible! Never!
"Never, eh? Come along...
I'll see how you don't marry him!"
Are you trying to humiliate me
in front of the guests?
Don't you know who I am?
Don't forget! I'm your daughter!
As stubborn as you are!
"Natrajan! I will die,
but I won't marry you."
You've had it! Stay locked
in this room! Get in!
Father!
What does uncle think of himself?
He thinks we can't go to the fair.
"But we will!
- How can we go, Vicky?"
He's locked the door from outside.
"The window's open!
- Come, let's go!"
Who does he think I am? I'm not
going to be pushed around!
"Now listen, I placed the order
with your brother-in-law..."
and that was exactly
three months ago.
That's true. But since their death...
- Deaths and births will go on!
Sit down. Does that mean
we must stop business too?
"My mother died only last month, and
my father is on his death-bed!"
How is he now?
- What is that to you?
"You didn't know him, did you?"
Didn't I say he's in hospital?
The expenses are back-breaking!
"Oh yes! Expenses are bound to occur.
- And you, on the other hand..."
don't deliver my order!
- I'll find out by tomorrow...
as to what's happened to your order.
I'll take your leave now.
- Where to? Sit down and listen!
How much of ~bhajiya' can
you give us for Rs.2/-?
Fifty grams.
- Fifty grams?!
What will we do with 50 grams?
Why not 300 grams?
"Not 300 grams, only 50 grams!
- Why not?"
Get lost! It's business-hour!
- We're hungry! Please give it to us!
There's a thief
in a burglar's den!
Careful!
Watch how you throw it!
"Wait, Sunny!
Let me try!"
Hurry up and give that to us!
"Your daddy, the police officer,
will be happy that you won!"
Hurry up! Dad must be waiting.
- Here... take it.
Keep shop this like and
you'll be bankrupt soon!
Why? What happened?
- That girl who took the harmonica...
She made a fool out of you!
- What?!
Let's run... hurry!
That was a nice performance.
Take your seats. And now...
there's one beautiful girl
and three cute-Iooking children.
"So, ladies and gentlemen,
what we will now see is..."
whether the prizes
announced by this airline...
will be won by this team.
Who flies from Bombay to Delhi?
Or from Patna or Poona.
"So, Madam!
Which song will you sing?"
Song?!
I understand!
You want to maintain the suspense!
"That's absolutely fine! So, ladies
and gentlemen, here you are!"
You may start now!
Keep quiet!
What do we do now?
- How should I know?
"I don't know anything!
Vicky, you sing a song!"
But I don't know a song!
- But we have to sing anyway.
Arrest them!
It's getting late.
Let's go home now.
"So, thank you, sister.
Good-bye."
Are you leaving?
- Yes.
"You're going home, eh?
- Yes."
But I don't have a home at all.
Then come to our house.
- Yes. Come to our house!
What about your parents?
- We don't have parents...
but we have an evil uncle.
But don't worry. It's our house!
What if uncle scolds us?
- How will he scold us?
We'll hide her away safely.
- Yes. We can do that!
Let's go then!
- Yes!
Here's our home.
- Has uncle returned?
His car's still not there.
There comes his car!
Run!
"Run, Vicky! Hurry!"
Hurry up!
- Not there! It's this window!
"Hurry up, uncle has come!"
The King then said to the Queen...
- What did he say?
What are you people doing here?
Hadn't I locked you up in that room?
"No, uncle. You locked us up here.
- Yes, it was this room."
"Am I right, Munni?
- Yes. It was this room!"
Is that so?
Anyway... I don't like
to lock you up like this.
So don't get into your pranks again.
Okay?
It's late now.
Go to your room.
Let's go...
Come on.
What's happened?
She got left behind there.
What are we to do now?
What's the matter?
"I'm feeling hungry, uncle.
- So, you're hungry now, eh?"
"When I brought the food,
you were into mischief."
"From where will I get food now?
- Sorry, uncle. Even milk will do."
Can we go?
- Come.
Come on outside!
Quick!
Here you are.
"Enough, uncle! My stomach's full now.
- What?!"
She doesn't want milk now!
You're a strange lot!
Go to sleep now.
"Listen, if you behave,
I'll take you to the fair tomorrow."
Where are you?
Vyjayanti! Where are you?
My God! My daughter...
Gopal! She's not around!
Find her! My darling daughter!
She's gone! Oh God!
Wake up now.
It's time for your school.
"Come on, Vicky. Wake up."
Look at the state of your room.
How often have I told you to keep
the carrom aside after you play.
But you will leave
it where it is.
"Wake up, now.
I'll pack your bags till then."
"When I was of your age,
I used to do everything by myself."
Everything was in its place.
But you children... don't even
write your names on the book.
"You were in bed, right? Then how
did you come out from the bathroom?"
What?!
But I was already in the bathroom.
Oh God!
Where do I hide now?
Why did you rush into
the kitchen like this?
I thought I must help you.
Keep the stuff for the tea ready.
And keep the plates outside.
I'll prepare the breakfast.
What's happening to this country!
Where's the tea-powder?
- Should be in the cupboard.
Keep all this on the table
and help Sunny get ready.
"Breakfast, guys."
Here's the omelette for you two.
And here's your boiled-egg...
the milk's still hot.
Be careful how you drink it.
"Where's my toast?
- You didn't even take it, uncle."
You're beginning to
be very forgetful.
I had certainly taken an egg!
And where has that disappeared?
You just ate it up!
You've forgotten it again!
"Don't forget to see a
doctor this evening, uncle!"
I understand everything. Hurry up
and eat. You've got to go to school.
"How will I go to school, uncle?
I've got fever."
"Fever, eh?
Your body-temperature's normal."
It's very typical
of the fever he gets.
"His body temperature appears normal.
But he's hot, within."
I see.
I'll get the thermometer and see how
much of a temperature you're running.
"You think your
uncle's a fool, eh?"
"How's the egg? There's milk, too!
Do you want it?"
Let me check your temperature now.
Come here...
Open your mouth.
Why did you take my toast?
- I did not eat it.
"And this omelette, too!
Who ate that up?"
So what if I ate it up?
Aren't I your sister?
"Sister, eh?
- Don't you touch me!"
"She beat me first!
- Sit down now, will you?"
You sit down too. Be quiet!
Oh my God!
He really has a fever.
All of you remain at home.
I'll send a doctor here. Okay?
Keep everything inside after
you finish your breakfast.
I've got to rush. And don't you
dare step out of the house. Get it?
"Please come in, Mr Mishra."
Mr Bignani's export-house had placed
an order with us for one lakh shirts.
How far have we got with it?
"As you know, Sir, I've been
trained in Japan for 4 years."
I've used the experience I got
there in the production here.
"As you know, every part in Japan
is made in different sections."
Everything is then put together
to make the finished product.
"I've applied the same technique here!
But as you know, this is India..."
"and since we're Indians,
we don't have different departments."
"So, I've used
a fantastic idea!"
What I thought was that...
"I'd first make one part of the shirt,
the second and so on..."
and then put
them all together!
But Mr Rahul... the thing is
that we're running into problems.
"What are the problems?
- Actually, we've first prepared..."
one lakh collars!
- What?!
One lakh collars are ready!
- And now?
"Now...? Now, we've run out of money
and there's no more cloth left too..."
Which means we can't do anything
more till we get money and cloth?
Correct! You're very wise
and intelligent!
But you're a donkey and a
fool of the first order!
I'll go to the factory.
- Don't you dare go to the factory!
Sit down here!
I can't believe this! On the one hand
are the children. And here I have...
You do something. Go to my house
and look after the three kids there.
And carry something to eat
for them on the way.
"Have you understood me?
- Yes, sir."
"Are you sure?
- Ofcourse, I understand..."
I'll take care. What are three
children where I handle so many!
When I was in Japan...
- Shut up! Quiet!
I don't want any mention of Japan!
Just like you all know... we have
an order for one lakh shirts...
which we have to execute
at the earliest.
"Till yesterday, this was
Mr B.P. Mishra's responsibility."
"But from today, I have taken
total charge of this factory."
"Henceforth, you and I will execute
this job together."
"If you are with us, I am
prepared to do anything."
"And... I am also
willing, smart boy!"
I mean... we have to run the factory
with hard work and honesty.
If we work holding
each other's hands...
Then it would be fun
holding hands.
I didn't mean that.
I meant to say that...
You have our lives at your disposal.
- I don't want your life.
I want shirts.
"Then take our heart.
- Not heart, I want shirts."
"What's a shirt, after all?
Everything belongs to you."
Here they are! Uncle's clothes.
Wear any you want.
Would you want to wear this?
Wear it. It's nice.
No... not this one.
There's this one too!
Do you want this?
This is the top...
and this is the pyjama.
No! It's the other way around.
Never mind. Shall I wear this?
I'll use the other clothes later.
Hurry up and rearrange everything.
Uncle will know.
"Who is it?
- Speaks from the window, eh?"
Your uncle's sent me...
"for your ~after-Iook'.
I mean, to look after you."
The name is B.P. Mishra.
I've been trained in Japan.
"I've got some fantastic food!
You take some, too!"
I forgot your water.
I'll go and get it.
Food?! Wow!
It's very good;
who brought it?
I brought it.
- You did?
You've brought it?
Mr Rahul said there were 3 children.
But there are four here.
Maybe I made a mistake
in hearing.
"That's the one.
- That one, right? Thank you."
What is it?
- Is this Mr Chopra's residence?
This is Mr Rahul Malhotra's home.
- But we were told...
this was Mr Chopra's house.
- Tell me what is this regarding.
My daughter's missing...
Her name's Vyjayanti.
Someone told me that she was...
seen yesterday with
Mr Chopra's children.
That is what has brought me here.
- You are absolutely wrong.
"To begin with, this is Mr Malhotra's
house, and not Mr Chopra's..."
"and then, there are
four children here. Not three!"
What had the police come here for?
- They came to enquire...
about the house where 3 children stay
but I told them that...
we have four children staying here.
- What?
"Mr Mishra, you're not only a fool,
but a first-rate liar too!"
We have three children here.
Not four.
"What did you say, Mr Rahul?!"
"I might be an idiot,
I might be a fool..."
but I'm certainly
not a liar!
Go away now and meet me
at the factory tomorrow.
"I'll leave,
but I'm not a liar."
"I can swear by God,
I'm not a liar!"
How can you say you have three
children when you have four?!
Go out before he comes in!
How's your fever?
- It vanished after you left.
I'll change and then we study.
Make up for your absence today.
"What's this, Vicky?
- What?"
Who messed around with my clothes?
- How should I know?
"Oh yes, Mr Mishra
went into your room."
"Yes, uncle, he was taking a look
at your clothes. Right, Sunny?"
That bloody Mishra...
how dare he touch my cupboard!
How did a girl's dress
land up in my room?
This was exactly what
I wanted to ask you...
how did a girl's dress
landed up in your room?
What?! Shut up!
Insolent idiot!
Who is it?
Just a minute...
Uncle!
What is it?
- It's a girl on the line!
A girl?
- Can I ask if it's her dress?
You escaped the other day;
But you must come at least today.
"I'll introduce you to my father too.
You'll come, won't you?"
"You see, Maya...
- What is it?"
I can't come now;
I've a lot of work.
You're working through
the days and the nights!
Come on... get down!
- What did you say?
It wasn't to you!
- You will have to come.
But I can't come right now.
"If you don't come here,
I'm coming over!"
Let's eat and go to bed early today.
- So early?
You said we'd have to study first.
- Not today!
I'm tired. You can do
the lessons tomorrow.
"Hurry up, Rahul!
Sleep before she gets here."
"O God, save me from the trouble!"
It's only 8 p.m. And there
are no lights in the house!
It looks like there's
nobody in!
He called me a liar!
"I will not remain silent, Mr Rahul!"
I will show you
the four children!
"I'm coming, Mr Rahul!
I'm on my way!"
I'll first eat and then
clean out the house!
You went to sleep
with the doors open?
"You've already come, have you?"
"The kids didn't
see you, did they?"
Everybody's asleep.
"But you're smart. You put them
to sleep, before I could get here!"
"I'll show you the
four kids, Mr Rahul!"
I'll wash away the
stigma attached to me!
"Now look, Maya...
don't you think it's very late?"
The night's only just begun...
"with the two of us,
so close together!"
Oh no!
We're closer than necessary!
Thief! Thief!
Thief! Thief!
Hurry! In the kitchen!
I am not a thief!
I am Mishra!
"Hurry, I will hide.
No, you hide... hurry up!"
"And till I don't return,
don't open the door."
Now where's the thief?
Where's the thief?
I should run away!
"Do you see my
condition, Mr Rahul?"
They beat me up!
They called me a thief!
What are you doing here?
I came to prove to you
that I'm not a liar!
"And that there are four kids,
not three! See for yourself."
These three are my kids. And that...
This is the fourth one!
Who are you?
And what are you doing here?
I...
I...
- My clothes?!
What are you doing in my clothes!?
- That's it!
She's the fourth one who's been here
since the morning!
Since this morning?
- No. Since last night.
"You're here since last night, in my
clothes, and I don't even know it!"
What's going on here?
Where have you come from?
These children brought me here.
Where did they bring you from?
- From the fair.
Do they sell girls
at fairs nowadays?!
We didn't pay for her.
We got her for free!
Shut up!
"When had you gone to the fair?
Come on, tell me..."
"We went there last night, uncle."
What?!
I can't figure out anything!
I'll go mad... I'll go crazy!
I can't understand anything...
Come here. Come here at once!
And tell me very honestly
as to what all this is about!
"But Mr Rahul, I'm right,
aren't I? There are four of them!"
"Please leave, Mr Mishra.
- When you called me a liar..."
"I was deeply hurt, Mr Rahul!"
Mr Mishra... please...
I beg of you...
"But I'm right, aren't I?!
- Please go now..."
"But I'm right, aren't I?"
Now what are you crying for?
"I'm ruing my misfortune, Sir..."
"When you hear my sad-story,
you too will start crying!"
"Don't cry, sister. Uncle's a
nice man. He won't harm you."
"Tell him your story.
- Should I? Okay, I will..."
"I was only six years old,
as old as Sunny now is..."
when my mother passed away.
You perhaps don't know what it is
to lose your mother at such an age.
Oh yes. We know that.
My father got married again...
and brought home a step-mother.
"She used to make me slog
through the day, uncle!"
"I used to do all the
household work, while she..."
But she...
- Who?
My step-mother! She wanted me
to get married to an old man!
What could my poor father say?
He too agreed.
But I ran away from home.
I left my home!
Now look... Listen...
don't cry.
Look here at me!
These little angels
brought me here.
They gave me shelter
here for two days.
But you can drive me
out on the streets now!
I'll go wherever
my destiny takes me...
"Good-bye, ~uncle'."
"So long, children...
I'll leave now."
Where will you go so late in
the night? Spend the night here.
Uncle! Thanks a lot!
"I'll leave in the morning,
if you insist."
"There's no need to do that,
if you're prepared to work here."
"Yes, sister! Stay on!
- What work will I have to do?"
You'll have to look
after the kids and cook.
I'll give you...
"Rs. 200/- a month, besides
your food. Will that do?"
Oh yes! It will do!
Come here.
"You won't throw eggs at her
and drive her away, will you?"
"No, we won't!
She's very good!"
"Okay, go in now..."
Where are you going?
Sleep outside here. On a mat.
Here?! On a mat?!
- Where else?
"Oh yes, where else?!"
Wake up!
"Hey, Sunny! Come here."
Wake her up.
- Who? Her?
"Wake up, sister!"
Wake up! It's 7. Get the children
ready and the breakfast too!
But I can't cook.
- What?!
Why didn't you tell
me this yesterday?
I would have told you if you
had asked. But you didn't.
What?!
"Okay, get the children ready.
I'll make the breakfast. Hurry up!"
The children are ready.
Can I help you?
"No, thanks.
- What's cooking?"
I was boiling water. What's this?
- It's burnt...
Oh my God...
- It's almost over.
May I ask you something?
- What is it now?
With whom has she gone on a picnic?
- It's with her friends!
Haven't I told you that?
- You did.
"But you didn't tell me whether
there's a boy, too."
There's no boy!
I know that! Fool!
"Please don't mind, Sir..."
it's only because she's
taken many days that...
I'm a bit suspicious.
Take a look.
Perhaps it's ready.
You've opened the
refrigerator again!
Tell us whether the ice-cream
we've made is ready or not!
How will it be if you keep opening
the refrigerator again and again?
"It'll all melt.
So, wait for sometime."
Look what I've brought for you!
Come quickly!
Hurry up!
That's good.
"This is for Munni, this for
Vicky and this for Sunny."
I have plenty of frocks.
Why didn't you bring a doll?
"Read these books yourself, uncle."
You could have brought some
musical instrument.
Uncle! I am not a kid that you
brought a game of Monopoly for me!
You could have brought a football
or a season ball.
"Come on, Sunny!"
"Here, this is for you."
You too may express
displeasure upon seeing it.
For me?
It's very...
It's very pretty.
"You too come, sister. Look,
the ice-cream is ready. Come!"
"Wow! It's ready!
- Here, eat it."
But we won't give it to uncle.
He brought such stupid
gifts for us.
Why don't you eat?
- How is the ice-cream?
Gosh! It's such a tasteless
ice-cream. It's no good.
We made it with so much of hard
work. And you call it no good?
So what? I didn't like it.
I called it no good.
We made it so lovingly.
"Even if you had lied that you have
liked it, we would have been happy."
"If you are all so intelligent,
why did you hurt uncle?"
Even if you didn't
like the gift...
couldn't you have lied
that the gift is a nice one?
"What say, Munni?"
You...!
You are still wearing my dress!
Go and wear the frock
that I have brought for you.
And don't you wear my clothes
henceforth. Understand?
And tomorrow... we will
all go on a picnic!
Come and sit down!
"To begin with, I gave you an advance
of Rs. 5 lakhs and cloth, too..."
and now you ask for more
money and raw material?!
"Yes, Sir.
- Now look..."
"I'm a businessman, not a
crazy old fool. Understand?"
Have you seen this contract?
Your late brother-in-law signed it.
"According to the contract, if you
fail to deliver within 15 days..."
I can bring you
out on the streets!
I can even have your
house and factory auctioned!
"That's true, Sir."
Then what are you sitting here for?
Go and get to work!
Return my money to me...
Get up and leave. Go!
"But how will I complete this
work in 15 days, Sir?"
That's not my problem!
It's your headache! Now leave!
Now that was a
good deal indeed!
Even his factory will be mine!
"Today's my lucky day. Had I asked
for something more, perhaps I..."
"Now look, Maya...
I'm very upset right now."
That man's made life difficult
for me. I don't know what to do!
Who is that who has made
my darling's life miserable?
"It's that old, fat, rascal...
Bignani, who sits on the 4th floor."
You can consider
your problems solved.
Why? Do you know him?
- How are you concerned?
What I do and how I do it
is my look-out.
What will you give me in return?
- Anything.
Just rid me of Bignani
and I'll give you anything.
"Then go home and relax, handsome..."
because your worries
are now my own worries.
My darling daughter!
The apple of my eye!
Tell me what you want
on your birthday this year.
You guess what I'd like.
Do you want a new car? A Maruti1000?
- No.
"A diamond-set?
- Not that, either."
A holiday in America!
- Oh no!
Then what do you want?
- Guess...
Oh yes! You're in love and
want to get married!
You've made the right guess!
- Won't you tell me who it is?
The same chap who just left
this place. His name's Rahul...
"I like him very much...
Please don't harass him, Papa."
That's no problem at all.
You can consider your work done...
I have him under my obligations
anyway. He'll do as I say...
Or I'll swallow his factory!
I'll bring him on the streets!
"No, don't do that..."
don't harass him anymore.
I'll make him dance
to my tunes now.
"How can you escape
from me now, Rahul?"
You will now
have to marry me.
"May I ask you something, sir?
- What is it?"
If Vyjayanti's temper has cooled
...can we prepare for the wedding?
It takes time for her temper
to cool! Whose daughter is she?
"Ofcourse, she's
your daughter, sir!"
That will be enough!
Take your seat!
Stop pestering me!
We'll prepare for your wedding
when the time comes.
"Till then, get on with your practice."
"Welcome, Mr Bignani. You should've
called me instead. I would've come."
"You're a busy man,
you run such a big factory..."
why should I waste your time?
Not at all...
Please sit down.
What can I do for you?
- I'll do something for you.
"After you left the other day,
I thought you were a nice man..."
you must be
given a second chance.
"If I don't help you in your
difficulties, who else will?"
Look at this... I've brought
you a cheque of Rs. 15 lakhs.
"Begin your work now,
in the name of God!"
There's no need to thank me.
"Let's sign the new documents,
for the new payment I've made."
Yes...
- It's a simple document.
What are you reading it for?
It's just like the old contract.
If you fail to deliver on time...
I can auction your
property to recover my dues.
Your brother-in-law too
had signed the same contract.
"In fact, I've given you
a month's time to deliver!"
Go ahead and sign it.
That's like a businessman!
"Start your work now,
in the name of God!"
"Oh sure, Sir...
- I'll leave..."
what you getting up for?
Please sit down! Good-bye!
"Hats off, Maya!
You worked wonders!"
"I wonder what you did on that
old man, he's turned a new leaf!"
It didn't seem like that old rascal
who was thirsting for my blood!
Wait and watch...
as to what all I can change.
What I don't understand is...
"how did that tight-fisted,
grumpy, old scoundrel..."
idiotic Bignani...
Please don't call him names.
"Why?
He's not your father, is he?"
The bloody...
"okay, I won't call him names.
I'll do as you say. Is that fine?"
"Look, I am going to dive!"
"No, not from there. That's
meant for the elders."
Dive from here only!
- Let me dive from there.
I know how to dive!
- No! You will get hurt.
Please... nothing will happen.
Please let me dive from there.
Don't be stubborn. You are still
a kid. You can't dive from there.
"Come on, come inside."
No! That's Vicky's Pepsi.
Give it here. Nobody will drink it.
Pass over the milk shake.
Where's Vicky?
- He's gone to change the dress.
Whose sandwich is this?
"Move away, please."
"You are all right, I suppose."
What a strange man you are!
"If you cannot care for the children,
why do you give them birth?"
"If anything were to happen to him,
we would have had it."
"Come on, Vicky.
Let's go home."
How much is it?
It's nominal.
- Let me see...
Did you see the consequence
of being stubborn?
I had warned you not to dive
from up there.
"But no, you want to
act whimsically!"
What if that life-guard
had not been there?
I would have died. What else?
Go to your room.
"Look, Vicky... weeping and being
angry won't help matters."
So don't weep. Your uncle
loves you very much.
That's why he's so
concerned about you.
I am not a kid. I can
take care of myself.
I am always treated
like a small child.
He should have let me die!
I don't want to live.
"No, don't say so. Don't..."
Calm down...
Have the children gone to sleep?
- Yes.
What should I do?
I don't understand.
I have lost.
I have lost.
And I am like a losing player who
cannot even abandon the grounds.
"What should I do, sister?
What should I do?"
What do you think?
"That by scolding like this,
by screaming like this..."
the children will
understand your point?
You mean I should listen
to their every fancy?
No... not at all.
"But sometimes, to make the
children understand..."
one has to become
a child oneself.
The children are ignorant.
They don't understand.
You will have to understand them.
Vicky is growing big now.
He doesn't like it when
you treat him like a kid.
He is going through
that delicate age.
"Now just think, when you were a kid,
did you like it when..."
"If you weren't around, how would
I have taken care of these kids?"
"Uncle, let's go to sleep.
I am feeling scared alone."
You proceed.
Wait... I will come.
Let's go.
"Your kite's flying beautifully...
Give it to me, please!"
Get lost!
- Give it to me!
"Flying kites?
I was good at it, too."
"It's not good enough.
Give it some more thread, Vicky."
"You'll teach me this, too?
I can't do anything, right?"
"I know nothing, do I?"
"Come, Sunny...
Let's fly our own kite."
You don't know I'm an expert
at it. I was the ~Master'!
You first take the kite...
keep it on the head like this.
And bend it...
That's alright...
Let's take another kite.
Here's the kite...
and you tie the thread now.
"When I flew a kite, nobody
could ever compete with me!"
Come on now...
Hold this...
They've flown away!
- Look at this. I'll show you.
Hey! It's not flying!
"There's something wrong with it.
- Hold this for a while, Munni."
"Give it to me, Uncle.
And stand there with the kite."
How do I hold it?
- Like this. Now stand there.
Over there...
Now release it...
- Like this?
Should I?
- Yes... release it!
"Here you are.
- Give it some thread, Sunny."
"Give it to me now, Munni."
"Hey! Hey!
- Watch out, uncle!"
"It's stuck, Vicky!
- Let me hold it."
He can't fly it...
can only make it stick somewhere!
It's snapped!
It's gone!
- So what? Get him another kite.
"You're good at
flying kites, Vicky."
How do you tie the knot?
It's raining!
- Run! It's pouring!
Uncle!
- Strange children!
You've run away like old men!
The first rain must
always be enjoyed! Come on!
Come on!
- Uncle seems to have reformed!
It's nice that your
business is doing well.
How often have I told you to bring
something to munch with the tea?
Get lost now!
Do you know this man who
just served us the tea?
He used to be the proprietor of
a garment-factory like you are.
I used to work for him.
But he could never do business...
and is my servant now.
The one principle of business is
that the opportunities you get...
should never be lost.
Or you end up
being like him.
"I'm trying to learn from you, sir."
It's only because of you that
my factory's functioning again.
"Today's a lucky day
for you, Rahul..."
Do you know how?
- How is that?
"Now look,
I swear upon God..."
I was going to ruin you. I was
about to bring you on the streets.
"But I didn't do that.
- It's your magnanimity, sir."
No... not at all!
"After you left the other day,
my daughter arrived!"
Daughter?
- Maya... my only daughter!
She told me that you
have been old friends.
"I know what ~friendship' means, too.
I'm not a fool."
"It means you approve of each
other and are in love, too!"
It's true that we know each other.
But...
Why are you feeling shy?
I approve of my daughter's choice!
Let's turn our business
into a relationship.
I'll get you engaged next Sunday.
Shake hands on that!
You won't get this
opportunity again!
Did you see that chap
who brought us tea?
When people get to know that
you're my son-in-law...
you'll get a lot of business.
Your life will be made!
And do you know why?
Because everybody knows I can do
~anything' for my daughter's sake.
And what happens of Vyjayanti?
She loves me.
"And I love her, too.
Isn't that true?"
Perhaps it's true...
But I've made no promise to her.
I've never said a word to her.
"I should be thinking about the
children's welfare now, not my own."
I should be thinking
about their future.
For their future and happiness...
marrying Maya...
would be the
best thing to do.
Listen...
haven't you slept?
What's the matter?
Do you need something?
"No, nothing."
"No, thank you."
"I have something to
speak to you about, Maya."
"Since we're getting married, it's
important for you to know that..."
there are three children of
my late sister. They stay with me.
Any girl who marries me...
will have to give the
children as much love as I do.
"All that appeals to you
will appeal to me, too."
Everything will be as you wish.
Is that fine?
Yes.
Then come home this evening.
And meet the children.
Can I come at Eight?
- Okay.
"Atleast tell us whom you
are expecting, uncle."
You'd better behave
before the guest.
Children... this is Maya...
"and Maya, this is Vicky..."
that is Munni.
And this is Sunny.
"And who's that, Rahul?
Introduce me to her, too."
"That's Vyjayanti, Maya.
And Vyjayanti, this is Maya."
Hello.
- Hello.
She's...?
Vyjayanti is the
children's governess.
"In other words,
she's a maid-servant."
She's no maid-servant.
She's our sister!
I'm hungry...
how about dinner?
Yes.
I must say...
the maid cooks rather well.
It's from a restaurant.
- Is that so?
Then what do you do around here?
- She stays with us...
because we all like her.
And we don't let the one we
don't like stay in this house!
"Right, Vicky?"
How often have you been told
not to speak while eating?
Now eat quietly.
"Won't we need someone to cook,
after we get married, Rahul?"
Yes...
I was about to tell you that...
I'm getting engaged to Maya
and then marrying her.
"How was your dinner-date, dear?"
Good; but Rahul has three of his
sister's children staying there.
I didn't like them.
Will I have to live with
that crowd after marriage?
Why are you getting worried?
"First get married, after which
we'll have them sent to a hostel."
"Do that, Papa.
Or I'll die of boredom!"
Don't you worry!
Have this crisps...
Move aside. Let me do it.
- No.
It's alright.
"You're angry with me, aren't you?"
No.
I know I should have told you.
About Maya...
Why?...
Where's the need to tell me?
"I'm only the maid-servant, aren't I?"
I'm going out...
and will be late.
Feed the children.
The keys.
Won't you ask me
where I am going?
Where?
I'm getting engaged today.
With Maya.
That's where I'm going.
What's wrong?
She's crying.
- Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?
- What's that to you?
Go away from here.
- Why should we go away?
"When we used to cry,
you always consoled us."
"And now, when you're crying,
you say we have nothing to do?!"
Your uncle...
he's getting engaged...
What does getting ~engaged' mean?
- It means...
uncle is getting married to someone.
- It's Uncle who's getting married!
Why is she crying?
- Because she loves uncle.
And wants to marry him.
Isn't it true?
- Yes.
Then what's the problem?
The problem is that he's
getting engaged. Right now.
Enjoy yourselves!
Don't forget those delicious ~kebabs'!
Congratulations to you!
Excuse me! Give me a minute...
"Come here, Maya..."
Your attention please.
I am very happy today.
"Because my only daughter, Maya,
is getting engaged today."
"I will now introduce you to
my future son-in-law, Rahul..."
"come here, son.
What are you waiting for?"
Give him a big hand.
"He's from the same trade...
A good boy, too!"
And now my future son-in-law...
"will put this engagement ring
on my pretty daughter, Maya's finger."
"Here's the ring, Rahul...
Look at it! It's ruby!"
"Put it on her finger...
Come here, Maya."
"Where's the photographer?
Come here, idiot! Click some snaps!"
Wait!
This engagement can't take place!
It can't!
And who are you?
- We'll tell you that.
This is our mummy
and that's our Papa.
He doesn't like
our mother and us.
That's the reason why
he's getting married again.
"Don't weep, mother, don't weep.
- What's all this, Vyjayanti?"
"That's what I want to know, dear.
Why's all this happening?"
What mistake have I made?
- What?!
You treated me like a
maid-servant in your house.
But I remained silent.
You never called
your children your own...
I even tolerated that.
I've been silent all along.
But I'll no longer be quiet.
"As long as I'm alive, I will
not let you marry this wretch!"
"No, mother! Please don't!
- No..."
"please don't leave us, mother!"
Atleast please give this
poor soul a glass of water.
"Here you are.
- No, mother!"
"No, mother...
- Please don't..."
"No, mother...
- Please don't drink it, mother!"
"I'm going away from your
life forever, my dear!"
You can marry this
wretch after I'm no more!
"No, mother...
- Leave me children..."
Stop this farce!
And go home!
We will not leave this place
without you. My dear...!
What are you doing?
Leave me! Let me go!
That's enough!
I said we've had enough!
You cheated me...
and cheated my daughter too!
I will not spare you!
Give me my ruby-ring!
Now get out from here!
Get lost!
What are you looking at me for?
Go home!
The party is over!
The drinks and food are all over!
Go away!
I can't believe why
you did all this!
There's a limit to mischief!
Do you know how humiliated
I have been because of you?
"And you, Vyjayanti!
They're innocent kids..."
but you could have been sensible.
Why did you have to join them?
Answer me!
- It's because I love you.
I just can't see you
marrying someone else!
Please don't leave us...
Please don't go!
She's leaving...
Please stop her. Please!
"For our sake!
Please, uncle!"
What is it?
Go inside.
I understand!
I know what you
are thinking about.
What is Bignani doing here
after last night's mess!?
I'll explain this to you.
"We've made enquiries, too."
She's not your wife!
She's your maid-servant!
Only your maid-servant!
"And they're not your children,
they're your sister's offsprings!"
Let's bury the past.
You forget everything.
"We'll forget it, too."
"I even forgive you,
because of my daughter."
But just remember one thing...
if the maid now dreams
about becoming the mistress...
it's a very tricky issue.
A very dangerous one!
So what if the children are close
to her? Will she advantage of that?
"I'm a businessman,
I know these things..."
Take my advice...
"throw her out of the house,
here and now!"
Throw her out!
I know everything!
Come here.
Mr Bignani...
this girl is not the
maid-servant in this house.
She's a mother to these kids.
She's their elder sister;
their friend.
Maybe you'll never understand
what she means to these children.
As for Vyjayanti
leaving the house...
listen to what I have to say.
She will continue staying here;
in this very house.
You'll be the one who
will leave the house.
With your daughter.
You've gone mad!
You're crazy!
You can do whatever you wish.
Now get out!
You don't even know
what you're saying!
You've hurt my daughter...
you've made Maya cry!
"You still don't know me, Rahul!
I will not spare you!"
I will not spare
you for anything!
You don't know the temper I have!
I'll bring you on the streets!
I'll finish you!
I'll drive you bankrupt!
You dare make my daughter cry?!
I will ruin you!
"You're laughing?!
Laughing, eh?!"
Have you gone mad?
And you? You servant?
What are you laughing for?
"When you beg with him on the
streets, we'll laugh at you too!"
Eggs!
I will not spare you!
"I will not spare you, Rahul!"
You're a sweet guy.
"I liked it a lot,
when you asked him to get out!"
"I like you a lot,
for throwing him out!"
You're very courageous.
You're very lovable...
I love you!
What is she saying?
What I was saying is that...
"Before you signed this contract
with Bignani, did you read it?"
"I had, but I had no other way then.
I needed money so desperately..."
that I'd have probably
signed even a blank paper!
You're trapped!
You really are trapped!
"According to this contract,
if you don't execute..."
his order of one
lakh shirts within 15 days...
he'll auction your factory
and your house to recover his money!
But there must be a way out.
- There are two ways.
Either execute his order of
1 lakh shirts within 15 days...
Or return his money with
interest. That's all!
"We have 24,000 shirts ready
in our factory right now."
"At our normal speed, if we
make 1,000 shirts everyday..."
we still can't make 1 lakh shirts in
15 days. No matter how hard we try!
"We will have to try hard, Mr Mishra.
If we work three shifts and day..."
"and make 5,000 shirts everyday, we can
turn out 75,000 shirts in 15 days."
But who will make the
labour work for 24 hours a day?
"Besides, you know our workers.
You've met them, haven't you?"
"Apart from this, we'll also need
threads, buttons, their food..."
Who'll pay for all that?
Tell me.
Which is why I say we must pay back
Bignani and terminate the contract.
But who'll give him so much of money?
- Father!
My father will pay him off.
How much money do you need?
We're talking business here.
You make the tea.
I know. How much money is that?
- Lakhs of rupees!
20 or 30 lakhs is no big deal
for my father. It's simple!
Really!
- What's she saying?!
Now look; this is no time
to lose your balance of mind.
Please go.
Mr Mishra...
- You're not understanding me!
I'm no servant at all!
No servant!
She seems to have gone mad.
Want a doctor?
"Now look, Vyjayanti... I've never
considered you to be a servant."
I never have.
Now go downstairs...
and see what the kids are upto.
You're not understanding
what I've said. Come with me...
"Hi, there!
Where's father?"
My child!
You've come at last!
Father!
- My child!
"I'm back, father. But I've
given you a lot of trouble!"
"That's alright, my child!"
Who's this boy?
Let's go inside.
I'll explain.
Come in.
Come in.
A cheque for Rs.10 lakhs!
"Which papers will
I have to sign, sir?"
It's not necessary
to sign any papers.
"I always consider the person,
before I part with the money."
I'll return every penny to you.
- That's not necessary...
But there's a condition.
Forget Vyjayanti.
You cannot get
married to Vyjayanti.
"But why, father?"
Because he does not
belong to our caste.
You will marry only
an lyer. Understand?
"But, father...
- Quiet!"
You can't marry Vyjayanti.
I came here for your help...
Not to sell my Love.
My love is not for sale.
Keep this money;
it's for your own good.
You only can't marry Vyjayanti.
Because she will not be
allowed to leave the house.
That's between
you and Vyjayanti.
"I'll wait outside, Vyjayanti."
"Why can't I get married
to Rahul, father?"
What's wrong with him?
- Nothing.
He's a good boy;
but he's not from our caste.
And you will marry only an lyer.
Understand?
How you go on about lyers!
"If I get married,
it will only be Rahul!"
"If that's the case,
you won't get a penny!"
I don't want your money!
You can keep it all!
Working round the clock won't help!
It's not possible.
We have very little time.
"Moreover, to start our work,
we need atleast Rs.60 to 70,000!"
You tell me where we will
get the money from! Go on!
If our workers put
in 24 hours a day...
we'll have to pay them thrice
or four times their wages!
Today happens to be
the salary day too.
Tell me where we will
get the money from!
"Then there is the thread,
needles, buttons, raw-materials..."
the electricity bills. Where
will the money come from? Japan?
"We are destined to
be separated, Rahul."
What she says is the bitter truth.
We have no other option left.
I have something to
say to all of you.
"Today is the day of your salary,
but I have no money to pay you."
"In fact, I have something
to ask you for today."
I want your help.
You all know that...
we are not being able to execute
Mr Bignani's order of 1 lakh shirts.
"If we don't, this
workshop will be auctioned."
There is only one
way out of this mess.
"That we work for 16 or 20 hours,
instead of the usual 8 hours."
Every effort that
someone puts in will help.
I have no grouse against
someone who can't.
I'll pay you thrice the
wages for your effort.
But I can't pay you anything today;
Today I have nothing.
I can pay you only after
I have delivered the shirts.
"That is, if you can trust me."
"I'm finding it strange, too,
that as your boss..."
"instead of giving you something,
I'm asking you for your help."
"I'm looking humbled, aren't I?
For begging before you?"
"No, sir..."
one only looks to his own
people when he's in need.
"By asking for our help,
you've really honoured us."
You've considered
us to be your own.
"I'll put in 16 hours for you, sir!"
"I'll work for 20 hours, sir."
"I'll work, too, sir.
- I'm ready, sir."
"You can count me in, sir.
- I, too, sir."
"We're all with you, sir!"
"What's this?
- You need money, don't you?"
"You can pawn this.
Return it to me, later."
"No, Roshni. You people have
given me what I needed most."
Your support.
I can take on the world now.
"Could this happen in
your Japan, Mr Mishra?"
"No, sir..."
this could
happen only in our India!
Keep it inside.
...and close it now.
Take the goods straight
to Mr Bignani's office...
and take his signature on this
paper after you deliver it. Got it?
Please don't worry!
I'll do all that.
We have to worry because Bignani
is dying to sell out!
You don't know him.
- I know everything.
Now please let me go!
Give me the coconut!
Here it is!
Come home after you finish
with the delivery.
Halt! Halt!
"Hello, Constable!
What's the matter?"
"Speak to the officer!
Come on, get out!"
"Okay... just a minute.
Will you open it, please?"
"Greetings, sir.
What's up?"
We have information that you're
carrying contraband in your vehicle.
"What are talking about, sir?
You've been misinformed!"
We're only carrying garments...
Shirts like the one I'm wearing!
Let me take a look...
- Now look...
I'm already late.
Please let me go.
Do you want me to lock you up?!
- Okay...
Show him everything.
We don't carry smuggled goods; nothing
illegal. We're garment-manufacturers.
"Look, there are shirts here.
And there, too..."
Hey!
Keep it! Go on!
"Be quick.
- What's going on, Bignani?"
An auction! Your house and your
factory are being auctioned!
But we've already sent the goods
to your office some time back.
"He's lying again, Mr Magistrate!"
He's ruined me by lying to
me for many months now!
"The consignment has left
our factory, Mr Magistrate."
"By now, it must have
even reached his office."
"When the goods weren't even ready,
how could they reach my office?"
"If you've really sent it,
show me the Receipt. Where is it?"
Doesn't it take some
time to bring the receipt?
"It's on it's way, sir.
- They're making excuses again."
"From saying he's sent the goods,
and the receipt..."
he'll say the
goods were stolen!
"We've been cheated, Mr Rahul!"
Some gangsters in the disguise
of policemen have cheated me.
They took away the goods with the
vehicle we were carrying it in!
"Stolen, did you say?
I had already said it!"
I had told him
you'd make an excuse.
"But when the goods were not even
ready, how could they be stolen?"
"I know you're at the
bottom of all this, Bignani."
I am?! How am I?!
This auction can't take place.
There's a conspiracy...
Why can't the auction take place?
"Look, gentlemen.
You still have two hours."
"You can do anything you wish,
in these two hours."
The auction will begin at 12.
- But...
We'll somehow have
to unearth the goods.
"Okay, Bignani... I'll be here
before 12 with the goods."
"Big deal! Get the goods, my foot!
Go away!"
"Please stay back, Mr Lawyer.
I'll return too."
So what you mean
to say is that...
"the Transport officer stole
the vehicle and the goods, too!"
They could even have
been crooks in disguise.
Please hurry with the formalities.
We have very little time.
We'll work as we please...
Don't try teaching us our duty!
I'm not trying anything!
I'm only requesting you to hurry!
Please send wireless messages...
A search-party...
so that we learn
something about the vehicle.
Are you teaching
me my job again?
"No, sir...
- The inspector seems to be corrupt."
What did you say?
What were you saying?
Throw them all out!
Now sit here quietly.
He's insulting us!
- What's all the fuss about?
At least tell me what
this is all about!
Our goods have been stolen!
- A theft?
"That too, in the house
of these crazy kids?!"
How could the thief dare
to enter their house?!
It didn't happen at home.
It took place on the streets!
They vanished with a whole
tempo-Ioad of our consignment!
Then what are you doing
at the Police Station?
Come here to me...
Come on!
Come...
- No! Don't...
Now tell me in which
area did this happen?
Give me the description of the one
who vanished with your vehicle.
But who are you?
You don't know me...
but I know you!
I've lived on your food...
I won't be ungrateful!
And when was this?
- The night I came to steal...
"Anyway, forget it."
"Tell me where this happened.
- At Khar, S.V. Road."
What did he look like?
- He was tall and well-built.
He was disguised as
an R.T.O. Officer.
Tall and well-built... did he
have a pock-mark on his left cheek?
Yes!
- Did he stammer while speaking?
Yes! He did!
You're absolutely right!
That's Usman!
Do you know him?
- I know him very well!
Come with me...
I'll introduce you to him rightaway.
"Let's go...
- Let's go, children."
Please come...
- Is this the bungalow?
Is this the tempo?
- Yes. This is the one!
Come with me.
"Hey, Chaman Chindi!"
Who's goods are these
that you have stolen?
Who's that?
- I? This is Chhotya.
What are you doing here
with the crowd? Get lost!
I didn't come
here to get lost.
"It's their consignment. Like a good
boy, hand it over to them. Or else..."
"Or else, what? What will you do?!
Get lost now!"
You dare...
"Listen, we've worked very hard to
make the goods that are in the tempo."
We slogged day in and day out.
Now if we don't supply the
goods on time...
these kids' home
will be auctioned.
"So, please return our goods to us.
Please!"
"Boring guy! Now look, stop your
lectures and get lost! Scram!"
"I'll have to use force,
if you don't heed my request."
"You'll use force
against us, eh?"
"The beating I give you will have
you sold with the house, too!"
Uncle... let it be.
Or we will be thrashed!
Heard what the kid said?
Get lost from here!
"Mind you, you are making a mistake.
- It's you who is making a mistake."
These are dangerous crooks.
It's not within your means
to fight them.
"She is right. Let's go back,
and fetch the police."
"Forgive us, gentlemen.
We are returning."
Mr. Mishra!
I am taking this tempo.
If any of you tries to stop us...
I won't be responsible
for what follows.
If you move even one step
towards the tempo...
we won't be responsible for
what happens of you thereafter.
Thrash him!
That's wonderful!
You were wonderful! Looks like
you too are Japan-returned like I am!
Sit quickly in the tempo!
We have very little time!
It's 12 'O clock!
It's already 12!
Start the auction now!
"You don't have any objections now,
do you, Mr Lawyer?"
The auction is about to begin.
"No power on earth can
stop us now, Vicky!"
42 lakhs!
- 43 lakhs!
45 lakhs!
- 48 lakhs!
55 lakhs!
- Hey! What are you upto?
Wow! That's wonderful!
Watch out! There's a tanker!
"Apply the brakes, uncle!"
"Apply the brakes, uncle!"
Uncle!
56 lakhs.
- 57 lakhs.
What went wrong?
How did this happen?
O God! What now?
"What are you thinking
about, Mr Rahul? Hurry up!"
"This is the only opportunity for
you to prove something, Mr Mishra!"
What do you mean?
- You must have learnt Japanese.
Please ask them to let us
have their bus for some time.
"Will you only keep bowing or
will you talk business, too?"
You too join me
in what I'm doing!
60 lakhs!
- That's something! 60 lakhs!
60 lakhs... 60 lakhs...
65 lakhs!
65 lakhs!
That's wonderful!
"Drive faster, Mr Rahul!
We're getting late!"
70 lakhs!
74 lakhs!
What are you doing?
80 lakhs!
82 lakhs!
85 lakhs!
Ninety lakhs!
- Ninety lakhs?!
That's the spirit!
Is there someone to outbid that?
90 lakhs... 90 lakhs...
Wait!
Stop the auction!
Stop!
We've brought the goods!
And where are you coming from?
- Mr. Magistrate...
There are the stolen goods;
This is the guy who planned it!
"Pushing me around!
He's a liar, this boy!"
Why would I have
your goods stolen?
"To have our house auctioned,
that's why!"
"Is your money all over,
that you're into stealing now?"
Have you gone mad?
Do you think I'd rob a piggy-bank?
"Is that so?
Bring him here then, Mr Mishra."
I will bring him rightaway.
I'll prove it in a minute.
Bring him here!
Who are you?
- Tell him.
"I'm innocent, sir.
I've done nothing."
This man had paid
us to steal the goods.
You bastard!
You liar! Look at him...
Why should all of them lie?
I think you're one who's lying!
Have you too gone mad?
"Mr Bignani, this is now
a case for the police."
And they will conduct
all the investigations.
"Why are you crying?
I'm there, aren't I?"
I'll deal with all of you!
- Get out!
I'll spare none of you!
- Get lost!
I'll spare none of you!
- Get lost!
"Careful, Rahul...
I'll never spare you!"
And what are you laughing for?
"It's an egg, is it?"
What are you waiting here for?
Go... Get lost!
"There's no problem in
life now, Mr Mishra!"
But there is a problem.
"Please give your consent, dad."
Keep your mouth shut!
"I've returned from Japan,
but I still request you..."
and make a fervent plea.
Please agree!
"Don't be difficult, Old Pop!
Give your approval now!"
It's not good to be obstinate
at this age. Please agree...
He's a ~sweet' boy...
Please give your approval.
You too?!
"I beg you with folded hands, sir...
Please agree."
"Please agree, sir.
We beg of you, sir..."
"please give your approval, sir."
"Please, grandpa...
give your approval."
"Please agree, Grandpa!"
The wedding will be held
in South Indian style!
Right ho!
