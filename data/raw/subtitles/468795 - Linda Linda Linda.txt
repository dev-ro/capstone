Don't let anyone tell us that when
we're no longer kids, we grow up.
When we grow up,
we won't quit being kids.
Where are the real we?
Should the real we be here?
We've only got a little more time
to be the real us...
2004, Shiba High Holly Festival
Okay, cut!
How was that?
Well...
Should we shoot another version?
Huh? The last part?
Tomoyasu, I have to go now.
No, wait a sec.
Which part?
That Shiba High Holly Festival part.
Cut close and... Bam! Make an impact.
Hmmm? Impact? Oh really...
Well then, let's see...
But we could use that one.
Oh yeah?
Yeah
Okay, then. Okay, that was fine.
Are you sure?
I could do it again if you want.
Oh, you can? She says she'll do it.
Should we do a close-up?
Well, I don't know...
What should I Do?
Then could you say the last line
once again, please?
Okay.
Yeah, thanks.
Could you... Could you do it
like you did the last time?
2004, Shiba High Holly Festival.
Cut!
LINDA LINDA LINDA
Nozomi!
Is Kei here?
Probably in the clubroom.
Been there all morning.
She won't listen to anybody.
Come with me.
Not now. I'll meet you later.
Kyoko
Where's kei?
Nozomi says she's in the clubroom.
How is it?
Yeah. I'm taking painkillers, so...
I'm going to the clubroom. Wanna come?
No, I'll pass.
You shouldn't worry about it.
Those two are... They're too...
Sort of short-tempered, you know?
Anyway, I'll go see what's going on.
Hello, sir.
Rinko
"The Japan-Korea 
Culture Exchange Exhibit"
"Beef Darts"
I'll print out the missing ones
by tomorrow.
Oh... Maybe I should make flyers
to copy and pass out.
Flyers?
It's okay. I'll do it.
Are you tense?
No.
You really should enjoy yourself.
I'll be in the classroom,
so come if you need anything.
Okay
So why is Moe Imamura's injury
the reason for their argument?
I told you, I don't know.
Did you ask them?
I did. But it's no use.
They won't say?
Right.
But you know, they're really alike.
Kei Tachibana and Rinko Marumoto.
Is Moe all right? Her injury.
I hear she jammed her finger
playing basketball in P.E.
And her middle finger, I think,
she either broke it or it cracked.
So I was asked to stand in.
What for?
The band, The band.
Rinko asked me to play the guitar.
But then she said to forget it.
I asked her why, but she wouldn't say.
Do the others know anything?
They won't say.
They're probably hiding something.
Isn't it your job as leader
to smooth things out?
Well, Sensei, why dont you just call them
over and ask them yourself?
Right?
Hello
Have you seen Kei?
She was just here, but she left.
Is it true that Kei and Rinko
are fighting again?
Who told you that?
Who? Everyone knows.
Dont go telling everybody.
Just leave them alone.
I know that.
It's just their usual thing, right?
Well, yeah.
You know everything already?
Who started it?
Who do you think?
I dunno... Rinko maybe?
What she did to Moe...
Asking someone to stand in
right after she got hurt.
But why is Kei angry about...?
Well, no...
I guess I thought so, too..
Kei hates Rinko, right?
That's not true.
I didnt say that.
Well... whatever.
So what's gonna happen now?
Is the band still on?
Hey Kyoko.
Is Kei here?
Nope.
Kei!
See, I told you she'd be here.
Kei, didn't you hear?
The teacher wants you.
Why?
He wants to talk to you.
And Abe wants to know
if the band's still on.
Yeah, is it?
If you're quitting,I have to reschedule.
So make up your mind.
So?
You're not gonna do it?
That's final?
We'll do it.
We'll do it!
I'll play the guitar.
Let's do it.
You read comics a lot faster now, Son.
Yeah.
I chose these comic books.
When they're good, you read faster.
So I get credit, right?
Yeah!
In that story, Yuuki kisses,
and then gets stabbed.
Dont tell me!!
It's okay, you'll still like it.
How about Ringo Shiina?
Too hard.
Puffy?
Are you serious?
Will you sing?
Sorry.
Aaaaargh.
What should we do?
What are you doing...
What's that?
It was in the locker.
Princess Princess... The Boom
Boowy...
Jun Sky Walkers...
I don't know any of these bands.
They're all old.
Oh, here's unicorn.
Tamio's band?
Yeah, Tamio's band.
Why do you know these?
Oh, Jittering Jin!
"You gave me an earring of"
"an upside down giraffe"
The giraffe's what?
Upside down.
Once more! The giraffe is...
Upside down...
No way. Let's hear it. Where is it?
Here..
Gimme.
It's not that funny.
This isn't it...
Yeah
"I want to be beautiful"
"Because there's a beauty,
that can't be photographed"
"Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!"
"Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!"
"If I ever meet you"
"And we talk together"
"I hope you realize
the meaning of love"
Hey Hey Hey Hey!!
Okay.
The first person that passes
by over there is the singer.
Where?
Over there.
What are you saying?
Then will you sing?
No way.
You do it, Kei.
I can't do both.
You can try.
No, I really can't.
How about Moe?
Moe?
Moe's voice isn't 'The Blue Hearts'.
It might work, though.
I want it to be a girl.
What's going on?
We're cancelling, right?
I'll tell Abe.
Ah... We already told him...
Oh, you did?
...that we're doing it.
You know, we're going to do The Blue Hearts.
You three?
We're looking for vocals.
Why don't you sing for us, Rinko?
Well?
Well then let's do the other one again.
We could re-arrange it a little without Moe...
It's The Blue Hearts or nothing, Rinko.
The other one has to be with Moe.
It's fine. We'll just find another singer.
Fine.
You don't want to do it anyway, right?
It's not that I don't want to, but...
What's the point in doing it?
There is no point.
Hey, Son! Son, want to join our band?
Sure!
You can sing, right?
Sure!
We're doing The Blue Hearts.
Uh.. sure!
That's okay, right?
It's okay.
Good luck, then.
Thanks.
What?????
No! No, no! I can't!
Why not? She can learn Japanese.
No, I mean, will she be able to
learn it all now?
That goes for us, too.
Well, I suppose...
We should first ask Son
if she wants to do it.
You're absolutely right.
But... Son answered
so carelessly over there.
We dragged her into this, didn't we...
Kei, why'd you have to be so irresponsible...
I said I'm sorry.
So, if Son says she doesn't
want to sing, then...
Then I'll sing.
Son, how about it? Can you do it?
What's wrong?
Are you all right?
What's wrong? Hey!
Are you okay?
What?
Son, you're crying...
Thank you
Here.
Thanks.
Do you always take this bus?
Hmmm?
Going to school... this bus...
Oh. Yeah
Maybe we've met.
I've seen you?
Hmmm.. I don't think so...
I've... seen... you!
Oh? You saw me?
Yeah.
Oh...
I never noticed.
Since when?
I don't really play the guitar.
Keyboard
Oh... keyboard
I used to take piano lessons.
So I can't really play the guitar...
Oh...
I'll... try my best, okay?
Sure. Do your best.
Okay.
Okay, I'll explain how it works.
You can drink all you want for 560 yen.
You look like you're a student
So you can choose from these soft drinks...
Oh... I just want to sing.
You can't just sing.
To use the facilities,
you have to order a drink.
I just want to sing, okay?
You just want to sing... well... you could
just order a single drink instead. It'd be cheaper.
Uh, let's see... coke, ginger ale,
melon soda, orange juice...
I said I just want to sing.
Yes, well, I understand, but...
Is this your first time coming
to a place like this?
Look, if you don't drink,
you can't sing.
That's weird.
No, it's not.
I don't want anything.
If you don't drink, you can't sing.
I don't want a drink.
Then you can't sing.
Oh, sorry.
I'm hot, I'm hot, I'm hot.
Shut up.
"Do you know where my right hand is?"
"Do you know where my right hand is?"
"Uh... missing..."
Kyoko! Kyoko!
What?!
Telephone!
Who is it?
A guy named Kazuya Oe.
What?
A guy named Kazuya!
Hey! What did you say to him?
Nothing...
Hello?
Oh, Hello.
It's Kazuya.
Hi, Kazuya.
Uh, you know that...
The bananas were too small.
Oh, the bananas...
One would be enough for four people.
Oh,. Enough for four?
Oh, okay. Yeah,
I'll get some ready and bring them.
Oh, and do you know about the hotplates?
Yeah, we have one.
You do? Will you  bring it tomorrow?
Sure, okay.
Okay. Tomorrow then.
Hello?
Yeah.
See you tomorrow.
Yeah. I'll bring it tomorrow.
"It's gone missing"
"I'll pass out wanted posters
All over the city"
It wasn't your fault, Moe.
That was...
You know, a problem between
Rinko and me.
A fight...
So don't apologize.
Rinko said the same thing.
But it is my fault since
all the practice we'd done...
You know, until now... was wasted
because of my finger.
Sorry.
Invite her in.
Okay okay.
Good evening.
You're going to Kyoko's?
Yeah.
It's really nothing, don't worry about it.
Thanks for the guitar.
Yeah. Use it.
It's much better than the other one.
Yeah.
Me playing guitar, huh...
"I'll grasp the microphone,
Like you've never seen before"
"I'll sing in a way,
You've never heard before"
"So"
"Do you know where my right hand is?"
Kei. Kei. Kei...
Terrible.
Shibazaki Highschool
Okay, this is a popcorn stand.
Hi there!
Thank you!
This stand sells fried noodles.
They're doing good business.
Welcome! Welcome!
I'm at the horror house at 3-2.
Uh... I'm going in.
Next! Next!
I can't do this! Auugh!
Finished delivering to class 5!
Good job.
I'm exhausted.
Why am I doing this?
It was your idea, wasn't it...
I regret it. Why do people want crepes delivered?
Hey, Kazuya, stand in for me later.
I want to do the Ultra Quiz.
Sure.
Chocolate banana, please.
Sure. One chocolate banana!
Chocolate banana coming right up!
Kyoko. Kyoko.
Look at Kazuya's ear. Here, look...
Aren't his earlobes amazing? Look, he's all hairy.
Stop it.
Don't be shy.
I'm not.
Here. Thank you.
Oh, there's another hotplate.
Who's is it?
It's mine. I brought it.
But I didn't ask you to.
Did you call her?
No.
Of course you wouldn't. Sachi called you?
Yeah.
Arai, take this to the audiovisual room.
Hey, the delivery boy's too busy.
Why don't you come with me?
Don't be so lazy.
Sorry I'm late.
Where're the others?
Nozomi's...
Where's Kyoko?
Not here yet.
We're ready. Wanna start?
Thank you
Sorry, can I go now?
Ah, ah..
When can you come back?
Well.. I can't really promise anything...
Try to come back by 4.
I can't let Kazuya do all the work.
Sorry.
Don't worry about it.
I'll try to come back...
Sorry...
You're late.
What do we do?
I'm really sorry.
Kei's always like that.
Hello
Yo, Kei.
What? Yeah, I'm fine.
What's up? A new boyfriend?
I'm kidding.
Now? I'm recuperating.
I'm not doing anything.
Studio Q? It's probably open.
Excuse me!
Hello?
Good afternoon.
Oh, Kei. Didnt recognize you.
You look totally different in uniform.
It's been a long time.
Yeah, it has.
Is Mr. Maezono here?
Yeah. He is.
You're going to Tokyo?
Yeah, next month.
Car? You taking your car?
Nah. I'm leaving it.
My brother uses it.
Oh, I see.
And I'll be back once a week.
Yeah. Come over sometime.
Sure...
So, what are you doing?
Oh. The Blue Hearts.
Really?
Yeah.
Far out... which song?
"Linda Linda", "My Right Hand" and
"An Endless Song".
Whoa, great, man.. that's cool..
Son. Son!
Don't stare.
Good afternoon.
Yo.
Vocals?
You a senior?
You in Kei's class?
You're in the pop music club, right?
Oh? You're not?
I'm from Korea.
What?! An exchange student???
Wow... Far out...
You're Kei's...
...ex-boyfriend?
You're funny.
I like you.
What's up?
Is something wrong?
Kei, it's this. See?
You gonna be okay?
Hey, it's twisted.
It's fine.
Raise your arms.
I'm okay.
Raise...
It's too high.
I'm fine.
We're gonna practice so get out.
You're all red.
Shut up.
Can't I listen?
We're gonna practice, so go.
Don't break anything.
Hurry.
I'll go wash my car.
What...
Let's practice.
I can see your underwear.
Shh!
"Because there's a beauty"
"That can't be photographed"
"Linda Linda! Linda Linda Linda!"
This isn't working.
Come on, Son.
Terrible.
Sorry.
That's right, it was Masami.
She and Moe were friends from Junior High.
So Moe joined.
Yeah, but Masami quit, so Moe asked me to join.
Around then, I was asked by Kei and joined.
That was in our junior year, right?
Yeah. From then on there weren't any changes
until you joined yesterday, Son.
Yeah.
Did you really get that?
(No...)
(No)
Kei and Rinko were the only original members.
Of course. They started it in the first place.
Oh really?
Hmm.. that's true.
Why did it end up like that?
It's hatred between those who are close.
That's pretty heavy.
My parents are like that.
They're freezing!
Thanks
I want that one.
Hey, we were saying...
What's our band gonna be called?
The name?
Yeah. We can't use the other one.
Let's just focus on playing it right, first.
-But its important! My motivation...
Like when you name a stray dog...
It grows on you.
Yeah yeah yeah yeah. She likes to start
from the appearance.
So? What's wrong with that?
I didn't say it was bad.
Yeah I like to. So what?
Fine.
Fine.
What?
-We didnt say anything.
What?
Seriously though...
we won't forget about times like this.
I mean, what Kyoko said
about it being important
I can understand what she means,
And...
When we finally play the gig
we'll probably be too busy
playing to remember anything.
Hey look, Nozomi's angry.
It's not my fault.
Nozomi's no fun. Don't laugh.
Son!
Ah...
That was rude!
Don't be angry.
"Like a rat, I want to be beautiful"
"Because theres a beauty"
