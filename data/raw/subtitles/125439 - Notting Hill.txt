So stay with us
because later this afternoon,
we're lucky enough
to be talking to Anna Scott,
Hollywood's biggest star by far.
Miss Scott's latest film
is once again topping the charts.
Of course l've seen her films...
and always thought
she was, well, fabulous.
But, you know, a million, million miles
from the world l live in...
which is here, Notting Hill,
my favourite bit of London.
There's the market on weekdays selling
every fruit and vegetable known to man.
Rock-hard bananas,
five for a pound !
The tattoo parlour
with a guy outside who got drunk...
and now can't remember
why he chose ""l love Ken.""
The radical hairdressers...
where everyone comes out
looking like the Cookie Monster,
whether they want to or not.
And then, suddenly,
it's the weekend,
and from break of day hundreds
of stalls appear out of nowhere,
filling Portobello Road,
right up to Notting Hill Gate.
And wherever you look thousands of
people are buying millions of antiques,
some genuine and some...
not quite so genuine.
And what's great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London.
That's Tony, for example,
architect turned chef,
who recently invested all the money
he ever earned in a new restaurant.
And so, this is where
l spend my days and years...
in this small village in the middle of
the city in a house with a blue door...
that my wife and l bought together
before she left me for a man...
who looked exactly like Harrison Ford.
And where l lead a strange half-life
with a lodger called--
Spike !
You couldn't help me with an incredibly
important decision, could you ?
lmportant compared to, let's say,
whether they cancel Third World debt ?
That's right. l am at last going out
on a date with the great Janine,
and l just wanna be sure
l've picked the right T-shirt.
- What are the choices ?
- Well, wait for it.
First there's this one.
Cool, huh ?
Yeah, it might make it hard
to strike a really romantic note.
Point taken.
Don't despair.
lf it's romance we're looking for,
l believe l have just the thing.
Yeah, well, there again, she might not
think you had true love on your mind.
Right.
Just one more.
True love here l come.
Well, yeah. Yeah, that's--
that's, um, perfect.
Great. Thanks.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
And so it was
just another hopeless Wednesday,
as l walked the thousand yards
through the market to work,
never suspecting that this was the day
that was gonna change my life forever.
This is work, by the way,
my little travel bookshop,
- Morning, Martin.
- Morning, Monsignor.
which, um, well, sells travel books,
and, to be frank with you,
doesn't always sell many of those.
Classic.
Profit from major sales push,
minus Â£347.
Shall l, uh,
go and get you a cappuccino ?
- You know, ease the pain a bit.
- Yeah, yeah.
Better make it a half.
All l can afford.
Get your logic.
Demi-cappu coming right up.
Um, can l help you at all ?
No, thanks.
l'll just... look around.
Fine.
Uh, that book's really not great.
Just in case, you know, browsing turned
to buying. You'd be wasting your money.
But if it's Turkey
you're interested in,
um, this one, on the other hand,
is very good.
Um, l think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.
Um, there's also
a very amusing incident with a kebab,
um, which is one
of many amusing incidents.
Thanks.
l'll think about it.
Or, in the bigger hardback variety,
there's--
l'm sorry.
Can you just give me a second ?
Excuse me.
- Yes ?
- Bad news.
What ?
We've got a security camera
in this bit of the shop.
So ?
So l saw you put that book
down your trousers.
- What book ?
- The one down your trousers.
l don't have a book
down my trousers.
Right.
l tell you what.
Um, l'll call the police, and, um,
if l'm wrong about the whole
""book down the trousers"" scenario,
l really apologize.
Okay. What if... l did
have a book down my trousers ?
Well, ideally,
when l went back to the desk,
you'd remove the Cadogan Guide
to Bali from your trousers...
and either wipe it
and put it back or buy it.
l'll see you in a sec.
l'm sorry about that.
No, it's fine.
l was gonna steal one,
but now l've changed my mind.
Oh, signed by the author,
l see.
Um, yeah, couldn't stop him.
lf you can find an unsigned one,
it's worth an absolute fortune.
Excuse me.
- Yes ?
- Can l have your autograph ?
Uh, sure.
- What's your name ?
- Rufus.
What does it say ?
That's my signature. And above it, it
says, ""Dear Rufus, you belong in jail.""
Good one.
- Do you want my phone number ?
- Tempting.
But... no.
Thank you.
l will take this one.
Oh, right, right.
So, uh--
Well, on second thoughts,
um, maybe it's not that bad after all.
Actually, it's a sort
of a classic, really.
None of those childish kebab stories
you find in so many books these days.
And, um, l tell you what.
l'll throw in
one of those for free.
Useful for, uh, lighting fires,
wrapping fish,
that sort of thing.
- Thanks.
- Pleasure.
Cappuccino, as ordered.
Thanks.
l don't think you'll believe
who was just in here.
Who ?
Was it someone famous ?
Would be exciting, though,
wouldn't it,
if someone famous
came into the shop ? Hmm ?
Do you know--
and this is pretty amazing, actually--
but l once saw Ringo Starr.
- Where was that ?
- Kensington High Street.
At least l think it was Ringo.
lt might have been that man
from Fiddler on the Roof.
- You know, Toppy.
- Topol.
Yes, that's right.
Topol.
Mm-hmm.
Actually, Ringo Starr doesn't--
doesn't look at all like, uh, Topol.
Yeah, but he was--
he was quite a long way away from me.
So actually it could've
been neither of them.
Yes, l suppose so, yes.
- lt's not a classic anecdote, is it ?
- Not a classic, no. No.
- Another one ?
- Yes. No.
Let's go crazy.
l'll have an orange juice.
- Oh, my God !
- Bugger ! l'm so sorry. l'm so sorry.
- Here. Let me--
- Get your hands off !
l'm really sorry.
l-- l live just over the street.
l have, um, water and soap.
You can get cleaned up.
No, thank you.
l just need to get my car back.
l also have a phone.
l'm confident that in five minutes...
we could have you spick-and-span
and back on the street again.
ln the non-prostitute sense,
obviously.
All right. Well-- What do you mean,
""just over the street"" ?
- Give it to me in yards.
- Uh, 18 yards.
That's my house there
with the blue front door.
Come on in.
l'll just-- l'll just--
Um, right. Right.
Come in.
lt's, um, not quite as tidy
as it normally is, l fear.
But, um--
The bathroom's on the top floor.
And the telephone's just--
just up here.
Here.
Let-- Let me, um--
Um, round the corner.
Straight on-- straight on up.
Bugger.
Would you like a cup of tea
before you go ?
- No.
- Coffee ?
- No.
- Orange juice ?
Probably not.
Um, something else cold.
Coke ? Water ?
Some disgusting sugary drink...
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest ?
- No.
- Would you like something to eat ?
Uh, something to nibble ?
Um, apricots soaked in honey ?
Quite why, no one knows, because
it stops them tasting of apricots...
and makes them taste like honey,
and if you wanted honey, you'd just
buy honey instead of... apricots.
Um, but nevertheless,
there we go there.
They're yours if you want them.
Do you always say ""no""
to everything ?
l'd better be going.
Thanks for your, uh, help.
You're welcome.
And, uh, may l also say,
um, heavenly.
l'll just take
my one chance to say it.
After you've read
that terrible book,
you're certainly not going
to be coming back to the shop.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, my pleasure.
So...
it was nice to meet you.
Surreal but, um-- but nice.
Sorry.
""Surreal but nice"" ?
What was l thinking ?
- l forgot my other bag.
- Oh, right. Right.
Thanks.
l'm very sorry about
the ""surreal but nice"" comment.
- Disaster.
- That's okay.
l thought the apricot and honey thing
was the real low point.
Oh, my God.
My flatmate.
l'm sorry.
There's no excuse for him.
l'm just going into the kitchen
to get some food.
Then l'm gonna tell you a story
that will make your balls shrink
to the size of raisins.
Probably best
not to tell anyone about this.
Right. Right.
No one.
l mean, l'll tell myself sometimes.
But don't worry.
l won't believe it.
There's something wrong
with this yogurt.
lt's not yogurt.
lt's mayonnaise.
Oh, right.
There we are then.
On for a videofest tonight ?
l got some absolute classics.
- Smile.
- No.
- Smile.
- l've got nothing to smile about.
Okay.
ln about seven seconds,
l'm going to ask you
to marry me.
lmagine.
Somewhere in the world
there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
Yes, she is, uh,
fairly fabulous.
- Do you have any books by Dickens ?
- No.
No, l'm afraid we're a travel bookshop.
We only sell travel books.
Oh, right. How about
the new John Grisham thriller ?
Well, no, 'cause that's, uh--
that's a novel too, isn't it ?
Oh, right.
Have you got Winnie the Pooh ?
Martin, your customer.
Uh, can l help you ?
Just, um, incidentally,
uh, why...
are you wearing that ?
Combination of factors really.
Uh, no clean clothes.
There never will be, you know,
unless you actually clean your clothes.
Right.
Vicious circle.
And l was, like,
rooting around in your things...
and l found this,
and l thought ""cool.""
Kinda... spacey.
There's something wrong
with the goggles, though.
No, they were, um, prescription.
-Groovy.
-So l could see all the fishes properly.
You should do more
of this stuff.
- So, look, any messages today ?
- Yeah, l wrote a couple down.
So there were two.
There were two messages ? Right ?
You want me to write down
all your messages ?
Okay, who are the ones
that you didn't write down from ?
No. Gone completely.
Oh, no.
There was one from your mum.
She said don't forget lunch,
and her leg's hurting again.
- No one else ?
- Absolutely no one else.
Though if we're going for this obsessive
writing down all the message thing,
some American girl called Anna
called a few days ago.
- What did she say ?
- Well, it was genuinely bizarre.
She said, ""Hi. lt's Anna.""
Then she said, ""Call me at The Ritz""...
and then gave herself
a completely different name.
- Which was ?
- Absolutely no idea.
Remembering one name's hard enough.
No, l-- l know that.
She-- She said that.
Um, l know she's using another name.
The problem is
she left the message with my flatmate...
which was a very serious mistake.
Um, l don't know. lmagine, if you will,
the stupidest person you've ever met.
- Are you doing that ?
- Yes, sir, l have him in my mind.
And now double it.
And that is the, um-- what can l say--
the git that l am living with.
And he can't remember--
- Try Flintstone.
- l'm sorry, what ?
l think she said
her name was Flintstone.
l don't-- l don't suppose, um,
Flintstone rings any bells, does it ?
- Oh, l'll put you right through, sir.
- Oh, my God.
Hello. Hi.
- Hi there.
- Hello ?
- Sorry. lt's William... Thacker.
- Yes ?
Um, we-- l work in a bookshop.
Oh, no, l promise you l've never played
anything cool in my entire life.
My flatmate, who'll l'll stab to death
later, never gave me the message.
l don't know.
Perhaps, um,
l could drop round
for tea later or something.
Right. Right. Great.
Classic.
Classic.
- Which floor ?
- Three, please.
Uh, are you sure this is--
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Sure.
- Hi. Hi. l'm Karen.
- Hi.
l'm sorry.
Things are running a little bit late.
Here's the, uh, thing.
Do you wanna come this way ?
Through here.
So what did you
think of the film ?
Yeah, l thought it was fantastic.
l thought it was, uh,
Close Encounters
meets Jean de Florette.
l agree.
l'm sorry. l didn't get down
what magazines you're from.
- Time Out.
- Great.
And you're from ?
Horse & Hound.
The name's William Thacker. l think,
actually, she might be expecting me.
Oh, okay.
Take a seat and l'll go check.
l see you've, uh--
l see you've brought her some flowers.
These are for my,
um, grandmother.
She's in a hospital
just down the road.
Thought l'd kill two birds
with one stone, you know.
Sure, right.
Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.
Which hospital's that ?
Do you mind me not saying ?
lt's a rather distressing disease.
Name of the hospital
kind of gives it away.
Right, uh, Mr Thacker.
Will you come this way.
Right.
You've got five minutes.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Uh, l brought these, but clearly--
No, they're great.
They're great.
Ah, listen,
l'm sorry about not ringing back.
The whole ""two-names concept""...
was totally too much for my flatmate's
pea-sized intellect.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.
l always pick a... cartoon character.
Last time l was Mrs Bambi.
- Everything all right ?
- Yes, thank you.
And you're from, uh,
Horse & Hound.
ls that so ? Well.
So, uh--
Uh, l'll just... fire away then,
shall l ?
Right.
The film's great, and, um,
l just was wondering whether...
you ever thought of having, um,
more, uh, horses in it.
Uh, well, we would have liked to,
but it was, um, difficult,
obviously, being set in space.
Space, right, yeah.
Yeah, obviously very difficult.
l'm so sorry.
l arrived outside.
They thrust this thing
into my hand--
No, it's my fault.
l thought this would all be over by now.
l just wanted to sort of apologize
for the kissing thing.
l seriously don't know
what came over me.
And l just wanted to make sure
that you were fine about it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely fine.
Do remember that Miss Scott is also
keen to talk about her next project...
which is, um, shooting
later in the summer.
Ah, yes, excellent.
Excellent.
Any horses in that one ?
Or hounds for that matter. Our readers
are equally intrigued by both species.
lt takes place on a submarine.
Oh. Well, bad luck.
But, um,
if there were horses in it,
would you be riding them...
or would you be getting, a--
a stunt-horse-double-man-thing ?
l-l'm a complete moron.
l apologize. l--
This is very weird. lt's the sort
of thing that happens in dreams,
not in real life.
l mean, good dreams.
lt's a--
lt's a dream, in fact,
uh, to see you again.
What happens next in the dream ?
l suppose in the, uh, dream--
dream scenario--
l just, uh,
change my personality...
because you can do that
in dreams and, um,
walk over and, uh, kiss the girl.
But, uh--
Time's up, l'm afraid.
Did you get what you wanted ?
- Um, nearly, nearly.
- Well, maybe just one last question.
- Sure.
- Right, right.
Are you... busy tonight ?
- Yes.
- Right. Right.
- Come in.
- Well, it was nice to meet you.
Yes, and you.
Surreal... but nice.
Thank you. You are Horse & Hound's
favourite actress.
You and Black Beauty...
tied.
How was she ?
Oh, um, fabulous.
Excellent. Wait a minute.
She took your grandmother's flowers.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That's right.
- Bitch.
- Oh, Mr Thacker.
Mr Thacker, if you'd like to come with
me, we can rush you through the others.
The others ?
Mr Thacker is from Horse & Hound.
- How's it going ?
- Very well, thank you.
Have a seat.
Well, did you enjoy the film ?
Yes, enormously.
- Well, fire away.
- Right.
Did you enjoy making the film ?
- Yes, l did.
- Good.
Any bit in particular ?
You tell me what bit
you enjoyed the most,
and l'll tell you
if l enjoyed making that bit.
Uh, l...
liked the bit in space...
very much.
Did you identify with the character
you're playing ?
Oh. Why not ?
Because he's playing
a psychopathic flesh-eating robot.
Classic.
So, uh,
is this your first film ?
No. lt's my 22nd.
Of course it is.
Any favourites among the 22 ?
Working with Leonardo.
- Da Vinci ?
- DiCaprio.
Of course.
And is-- is he your favourite
ltalian director ?
- Mr Thacker.
- Oh, no.
- Have you got a minute ?
- No.
Um-- Yeah, so the, um--
the-- the thing l was doing tonight,
l'm not doing any more.
l told them l had
to spend the evening...
with Britain's premier
equestrian journalist.
Oh. Well, great.
Fantastic.
That's, uh--
Oh. Shittity brickitty.
lt's my sister's birthday. Shit.
We're meant to be having dinner.
- Okay, that's fine.
- No. l'm sure l can get out of it.
No, l mean, if it's fine with you,
l'll be your date.
You--
You'll be my date...
to my little sister's
birthday party ?
- lf it's all right.
- Well, yeah, l'm sure it's all right.
My friend Max is cooking,
and he is generally acknowledged
to be the worst cook in the world.
But, um, you know, you could hide
the food in your handbag or something.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- He's bringing a girl ?
- Miracles do happen.
- Does the girl have a name ?
- Don't know. Wouldn't say.
Oh, Christ !
What is going on in there ?
Oh, God !
Hi. Come on in.
Vague food crisis.
Hiya ! Sorry.
The guinea fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.
- He's cooking guinea-fowl ?
- Don't even ask.
Good Lord,
you're the spitting image of--
Bella, this is Anna.
- Right.
- Okay, crisis over.
Max, this is Anna.
- Hi.
- Hello, Anna--
Scott.
Have some wine.
Thank you.
l'll get it.
Red or white ?
- Oh. Hey.
- Hi.
- Oh, yes, happy birthday.
- Thank you.
Look, your brother's
brought this girl.
Hi, guys.
Oh, holy fuck !
Hon, this is Anna. Anna, this is Honey.
She's my baby sister.
Oh. Hi.
Oh, God. This is one
of those key moments in life...
when it's possible
you can be really genuinely cool...
and l-- l'm going to fail
just a hundred percent.
l-- l absolutely,
totally and utterly adore you.
And l just think... you are
the most beautiful woman in the world.
And, more importantly,
l genuinely believe,
and l've believed for some time now,
that we could be best friends.
So what do you think ?
Uh, lucky me.
Well, happy birthday.
Oh, you gave me a present.
We're best friends already then.
Marry Will. He's a really nice guy.
Then we can be sisters.
Well, l'll think about it.
That'll be Bernie.
- Hi.
- Hi. Sorry l'm late.
Bollocksed up at work again, l fear.
- Millions down the drain.
- Well done.
- Bernie, this is Anna.
- Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.
-And you.
-Honey bunny, Happy birthday to you
- Hi, Bella.
- Hi.
Um, it-- it-- it's a hat.
You don't have to wear it or anything.
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What ?
- Wine, Bernie ?
- Mm.
You haven't slept with her, have you ?
That is a cheap question, and
the answer is, or course, no comment.
- No comment means ""yes.""
- No, it doesn't.
- Do you ever masturbate ?
- Definitely no comment.
- You see, it means ""yes.""
- Oh, my God !
So, uh, tell me,
um, Anna, what do you do ?
- l'm an actress.
- Oh, splendid.
What do you do ?
l'm actually in the stock market myself,
so, uh, not really similar fields.
Though, um-- um, l have done
the odd bit of amateur stuff.
Um-- uh, P. G. Wodehouse.
Farce, all that, you know.
""Careful there, Vicar.""
Always imagined it's a pretty tough job,
though, acting.
- The wages are a scandal, aren't they ?
- They can be.
l see friends from university--
clever chaps.
Been in the business longer than you.
They're scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year.
You know, it's no life.
- What sort of acting do you do ?
- Films, mainly.
Oh, splendid. Oh, well done.
How's the pay in movies ?
l mean, last film you did,
what did you get paid ?
Fifteen million dollars.
Right.
So that's, well, fairly good.
Right, l think we're ready.
Bella, can you tell me
where l can find--
Oh, sorry.
lt's down the corridor on the right.
l'll show you.
Quickly, quickly.
Talk very, very quickly.
What are you doing here
with Anna Scott ?
- Anna Scott ?
- Yes. Shut up !
- What, the film star ?
- Shh !
- Oh, God !
- What ?
- Oh, God. Oh, goddy God.
- What did you say to her ?
l don't believe it.
l actually walked into the loo with her.
l was still chatting
when she started unbuttoning her jeans.
- She had to ask me to leave.
- Oh, God.
So you knew who she was ?
Of course l did, but he didn't.
Well, not instantly, but l-- l--
l got away with it.
- What do you think of the guinea-fowl ?
- l'm a vegetarian.
Oh, God.
So, how's the guinea-fowl ?
Best guinea-fowl
l've ever tasted.
Having you here, Anna, firmly
establishes what l've long suspected--
that we really are the most
desperate lot of underachievers.
- Shame.
- l'm not saying it's a bad thing.
ln fact, l think it's something
we should take pride in.
l'm gonna give the last brownie
as a prize...
to the saddest act here.
- Uh-oh.
- Bern.
Yeah, all right.
Well, obviously, it's me, isn't it ?
l mean, l work in the city in a job
l don't understand,
and everyone keeps
getting promoted above me.
l haven't had a girlfriend since--
well, since puberty.
And... nobody fancies me.
And if these cheeks get any chubbier,
they never will.
- Nonsense. l fancy you.
- Really ?
Yeah. Or l did
before you got so fat.
You see.
And unless l'm much mistaken,
your job still pays you
rather a lot of money...
whilst Honey here
earns 20 pence a week...
flogging her guts out
in London's worst record store.
Yes ! And l haven't got hair.
l've got feathers.
And l've got funny goggly eyes.
And l'm attracted to cruel men.
And, actually,
no one will marry me...
because, um, my boosies
have actually started shrinking.
- You see, it's incredibly sad.
- But on the other hand,
her best friend is Anna Scott.
That's true. l can't deny it.
She needs me. What can l say ?
And most of her limbs work, whereas
l'm stuck in this thing day and night,
in a house full of ramps.
And to add insult
to serious injury,
l've totally given up smoking,
my favourite thing.
And, um, well, the truth is,
we can't have a baby.
Oh, Belle.
C'est la vie.
Still, um, we're lucky in lots of ways.
But surely that's worth a brownie.
Well, l don't know.
Look at William.
- Very unsuccessful professionally.
- That's true.
Divorced. Used to be handsome,
now kind of squidgy round the edges.
And absolutely certain never
to hear from Anna again...
- once she's heard that his
nickname at school was--
- Floppy.
You did.
l can't believe it, you did.
Thanks very much. Thank you.
Well, at least l get the last brownie.
l think so, yes.
Well, wait.
What about me ?
l'm sorry ?
You think you deserve the brownie ?
Well, a shot at it at least, huh ?
You'll have to prove it.
This is a very, very good brownie.
l'm gonna fight for it.
l've been on a diet
every day since l was 19,
which basically means
l've been hungry for a decade.
l've had a series of not-nice
boyfriends, one of whom hit me.
Uh, and every time
l get my heart broken,
the newspapers splash it about
as though it's entertainment.
And... it's taken two rather painful,
um, operations...
to get me looking like this.
- Really ?
- Really.
And one day not long from now,
my looks will go,
they will discover l can't act,
and l will become
some sad, middle-aged woman...
who... looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.
No, nice try, gorgeous,
but you don't fool anyone.
Pathetic effort
to hog the brownie.
- Thank you for such a terrific time.
- l'm delighted.
- That's a great tie.
- Now you're lying.
Okay, it's true.
l told you l was bad at acting.
- lt was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, and you. And you.
l'll wait until you've gone
before l tell him you're a vegetarian.
- Good night.
- l'm so sorry about the loo thing.
l meant to leave.
l just--
Ring me if you want someone
to go shopping with.
l know lots of nice, cheap places,
not that money is necessarily--
lt was just so nice to meet you.
- Happy birthday. You're my style guru.
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Can l just--
- Oh.
- Thanks.
- Leave her.
- Good night, everyone.
- Bye.
Max, Belle,
we'll see you in a couple of days.
- Thank you, everybody. Call us.
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, Anna.
- Love your work.
Bye, Hon.
Sorry. They always do that
when l leave the house.
lt's a stupid thing.
l hate it.
- ""Floppy,"" huh ?
- lt's the hair.
- Mm-hmm.
- lt's to do with the hair.
Why is she in a wheelchair ?
Uh, because she had an accident
about 18 months ago.
And the pregnancy thing,
is that to do with the accident ?
You know, l'm not sure.
l don't think they tried for kids
before, as fate would have it.
Do you want to, um--
My place is just, um--
Too complicated.
That's fine.
Busy tomorrow ?
- l thought you were leaving tomorrow.
- l was.
All these streets round here have...
these mysterious communal gardens
in the middle of them.
- They're like little villages.
- Let's go in.
Ah, no, that's the point.
They're private villages.
Only the people who live round the edges
are allowed in.
Oh. You abide by rules like that ?
l don't. No, no.
But others do.
l just do what l want.
Um-- Right.
Whoopsidaisies.
What did you say ?
- Nothing.
- Yes, you did.
- No, l didn't.
- You said, ""Whoopsidaisies.""
No one says, ""Whoopsidaisies,"" do they ?
l mean, unless they're--
There is no ""unless."" Because no one
has said ""Whoopsidaisies"" for 50 years.
And even then it was-- it was just
little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly. Right.
So here we go again.
Oh ! Oh ! Whoopsidaisies.
Yeah, well, it's a disease.
lt's a clinical thing.
l'm taking pills and having injections.
And l'm told it won't last long.
- Okay, stand aside.
- l don't think that's a good idea.
Really, it's quite, um, tricky.
Anna.
Anna, don't. lt's harder than it--
No, it's not. lt's easy.
Come on, Flopsy.
Right.
All right.
Oh, bugger.
Oh, God,
this could be very unpleasant.
Ay !
Bugger, bugger.
Now what in the world in this garden
could make that ordeal worthwhile ?
Nice garden.
""For June who loved this garden.
From Joseph who always sat beside her.''
Some people do spend
their whole lives together.
Come and sit with me.
Bollocks ! Bollocks !
- Have you seen my glasses ?
- No, afraid not.
Big, big bollocks !
Average day, my glasses are everywhere.
Everywhere l look
there's a pair of glasses.
But when l want to go to the cinema,
they've vanished.
lt's one of life's real cruelties.
That's compared to, like,
earthquakes in the Far East
or testicular cancer, is it ?
Oh, shit.
ls that the time ?
Thanks for all your help
on the glasses thing.
Oh, you're welcome.
Did you find them ?
- Sort of.
- Great.
So who left who ?
- Uh, she left me.
- Why ?
- She saw through me.
- Uh-oh.
That's not good.
You can give me
Anna Scott any day.
l didn't like her last film. Fell asleep
as soon as the lights went down.
l don't really care
what the film's like.
Any film with her in,
it's fine by me.
She's not my type at all.
l prefer the other one.
You know, blonde, sweet-looking.
You know, what's-her-name.
Has an orgasm every time
you take her out for a cup of coffee.
Meg Ryan.
No, she's too wholesome.
The point about Miss Scott is...
she's got that twinkle in her eyes.
Probably drug-induced.
Spends most of her life in bloody rehab.
Well, whatever.
She's so clearly up for it.
You see, most girls, they're all like,
""Stay away, chum.""
But Anna,
she is absolutely gagging for it.
Do you know that in over 50Â°%
of the languages,
the word for ""actress"" is
the same as the word for ""prostitute"" ?
Where did you get that from ?
And Anna is your definitive actress,
someone really filthy
you can just flip over and start again.
- Right, that's it. Sorry.
- No, no. There's really no point.
Um, sorry--
sorry to disturb you guys.
- But, um--
- Can l help ?
Well, yeah. l wish l hadn't overheard
your conversation, but l did.
And, um, l just think, you know,
the person you're talking about
is a real person.
And l think she probably deserves
a little bit more consideration...
rather than having jerks like you
drooling over her.
Oh, sod off, mate.
What are you, her dad ?
- l'm sorry.
- No, l love that you tried.
Time was l'd have done the same thing.
ln fact--
Hi.
Oh, my God.
l just wanted to apologize for
my friend. He's very sensitive.
Uh, look, l'm sorr--
No, no, leave it. lt's, you know--
l'm sure you didn't mean any harm.
l'm sure it was just friendly banter.
l'm sure you guys have dicks
the size of peanuts. Enjoy your dinner.
The tuna's really good.
l shouldn't have done that.
l shouldn't have done that.
- No, you were brilliant.
- l'm rash and l'm stupid.
What am l doing with you ?
Uh, l don't know, l'm afraid.
l don't either.
Here we are.
Yes.
- Well, look--
- Do you wanna come up ?
Well, there seems to be...
lots of reasons why l shouldn't, so--
There are lots of reasons.
Do you wanna come up ?
Give me five minutes ?
To be able to do that
is such a wonderful thing.
- You've got to go.
- Why ?
Because my boyfriend who was in America
is, in fact, now in the next room.
- Boyfriend ?
- Yes.
- Baby, who is it ?
- Uh, it's, uh--
- Uh--
- Uh, room service.
Oh. How you doing ? l thought you guys
always wore those, uh, penguin coats.
Usually we do.
But l was just, uh--
just changed to go home.
And, um, then l thought
l'd take this final call.
Oh, great. lf you don't mind,
l would like something too.
Could you bring me up some
really, really cold water ?
l'll see what l can do.
- Still, not sparkling.
- Absolutely. lce-cold still water.
Unless it's illegal in the U.K. to serve
beverages below room temperature.
l wouldn't want you going to jail
just to satisfy my whim, now.
- No, l'm sure it's fine.
- Thank you.
Hey, one more thing.
Could you adios these dirty dishes
and take out that trash too ?
- Uh--
- Right.
No. No. Um, don't-- don't--
don't do that.
l don't think
it's his job to clear.
Oh, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
What's your name, man ?
Bernie.
Oh, listen, Bernie.
Thank you.
l really appreciate it.
Hey, you.
So, tell me. Tell me, tell me.
Good surprise or nasty surprise ?
- Good surprise.
- Oh, you're such a liar.
She hates surprises.
Hey, what are you gonna order ?
- Huh ?
- From him. What are you gonna order ?
Um, l haven't decided yet.
Oh, well, don't overdo it.
l don't want people saying,
""There goes that famous actor
with the big, fat girlfriend.""
l should leave.
This is a fairly strange reality
to be faced with.
l'm so sorry.
l don't know...
what to say.
Well,
l think, um,
""goodbye"" is traditional.
Come on.
Open up.
This is me.
Spikey.
l'm in contact with some quite
important spiritual vibrations.
Come on.
Hit me with it.
- There's this girl--
- Aha.
See, l been gettin' a female vibe.
Good.
Speak on, dear friend.
She's someone who...
can't be mine, and, uh,
it's as if l've taken love heroin,
and now l can't ever have it again.
l've opened Pandora's box
and there's trouble inside.
Yeah.
Tricky.
Tricky.
l knew a girl at school
called Pandora.
Never got to see her box or--
Right.
Right. Thanks. That's very helpful.
You didn't know
she had a boyfriend ?
Why ? Did you ?
Oh, bloody hell.
l don't believe it.
My whole life ruined because
l don't read Hello magazine.
Let's face facts.
This was always a no-win situation.
Anna's... a goddess.
You know what happens to mortals
who get involved with the gods.
- Buggered, is it ?
- Every time.
But don't despair. l think l have
the solution to your problems.
- Really ?
- Mm-hmm. Her name is Tessa.
She works in the Contracts Department.
The hair, l admit,
is unfashionably frizzy,
but she's bright as a button and kisses
like a nymphomaniac on death row.
Apparently.
Now... try.
l got completely lost.
lt's very difficult, isn't it ?
Everything's got the word
""Kensington"" in it.
Kensington Park Road. Kensington Garden.
Kensington bloody Park Garden.
- Tessa, this is Bella, my wife.
- Hello.
- You're in a wheelchair.
- That's right.
And this is William.
- Hello, William.
- Hi.
- Max has told me everything about you.
- Has he ?
Oh, yes.
You are a naughty boy.
- Wine ?
- Oh, yes, please.
Come on, Willie.
Let's get sloshed.
- Red or white ?
- Red.
Keziah.
- Some woodcock ?
- No, thank you. l'm a fruitarian.
What is a fruitarian, exactly ?
We believe that
fruits and vegetables have feelings,
so we think cooking is cruel.
We only eat things that have actually
fallen from the tree or bush,
that are, in fact, dead already.
Ah. Oh, right.
Right.
So, um, these carrots ?
- Have been murdered, yes.
- Murdered.
Poor old carrots.
That's--
That's beastly.
Delicious coffee.
l'm sorry about the lamb.
No. l thought it was...
really, you know, interesting.
lnteresting means inedible.
Really inedible. Yes, you're right.
Well, maybe we'll meet again.
Yeah, yeah.
That would be, uh--
be great.
Bye.
Well ?
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
And ?
l think you've forgotten
what an unusual situation you two have.
To find someone you actually... love,
who'll love you.
The chances are always minuscule.
Look at me.
Apart from the American, l've only
loved two girls, both total disasters.
- That's not fair.
- One of them marries me,
then leaves me...
faster than you can say
""lndiana Jones.""
And the other-- who seriously
ought to have known better--
casually marries my best friend.
- She still loves you, though.
- ln a depressingly asexual way.
l never fancied you much, actually.
Oh, God.
l loved you.
You were terribly funny, but...
all that kissing my ears.
l don't believe it.
This is just getting worse.
l shall find myself 30 years from now
still sitting on this sofa.
- Do you wanna stay ?
- Yeah. Why not ?
All that awaits me at home
is a masturbating Welshman.
Here we go.
- Good night.
- Night.
- See you.
- Right.
Guilty.
Very, very guilty.
So it seems.
Hi.
Can l come in ?
Come in.
They were taken years ago.
l know it was--
But l was poor and--
lt happens a lot.
That's not an excuse.
l just--
But to make matters worse,
it now appears as though...
someone was filming me as well.
So what was a stupid
photo shoot...
now looks like a porn film.
The pictures have been sold
and they're just...
everywhere.
l didn't know where to go.
The hotel's surrounded.
l know it's been months, but--
This is the place.
Thank you.
l'm just in London...
for two days,
but what with your papers,
it's the worst place to be.
These pictures are just so horrible,
and they're so grainy.
lt makes me look like--
Don't think about it.
We'll sort it out.
What would you like ?
Tea ?
Bath ?
A bath would be great.
Oh, Christ alive !
Brilliant. Fantastic.
Magnificent.
You must be Spike.
- Hi.
- Just...
checkin'.
Thank you, God.
l'm really sorry about last time.
- Oh--
- He just flew in.
- l had no idea.
- All right.
ln fact, l had no idea
if he was ever gonna fly in again.
lt's not often one
has the opportunity to adios...
the plates of
a major Hollywood film star.
lt was, um--
lt was thrilling for me.
So how is he ?
l don't know.
lt just got to the point...
where l couldn't remember
any of the reasons why we were together.
And you and love ?
Oh, well, there's a question, um,
without an interesting answer.
l have thought about you.
- Oh.
- lt's just that...
any time l've tried to keep...
anything normal
with a person that was...
normal,
it's just been a disaster.
Listen, l appreciate that.
Absolutely.
So what is that,
a film you're doing ?
Um, start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Would you like me to
take you through your lines ?
Would you ?
'Cause it's all talk, talk, talk.
Hand it over.
Right.
Um, basic plot ?
l'm a difficult but brilliant
junior officer...
who in about 20 minutes is gonna
save the world from nuclear disaster.
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Well done, you.
""Message from Command. Would you
like them to send in the H.K.'s ?""
No. Turn over four T.R.S.'s
and tell them we need radar feedback...
before the K.F.T.'s return at 1900.
Then inform the Pentagon we'll need
Black Star cover from 1000 through 1215.
And if you say one word about how many
mistakes l made in that speech,
l'll pelt you with olives.
- Very well, Captain.
l'll pass that on straightaway.
- Thank you.
- How many mistakes did l make ?
- Eleven.
- Damn it. And Wainwright--
- Cartwright.
Cartwright, Wainwright,
whatever your name is,
l promised little Jimmy
l'd be home for his birthday,
so could you get a message to him
that l may be late.
Certainly.
And, uh, little Johnny ?
- My son's name is Johnny ?
- Yep.
- Then get a message to him too.
- l'll do what l can, Captain,
but l can't promise anything.
And Cartwright goes.
- What do you think ?
- Gripping. lt's not Jane Austen.
lt's not Henry James,
but it's... gripping.
- Think l should do Henry James instead?
- You would be brilliant.
But this writer-- writers--
they're pretty damn good too.
You never get anyone
on Wings of the Dove saying,
""lnform the Pentagon
we need Black Star cover.""
For me the book is the poorer for it.
l can't believe you have that picture.
You like Chagall ?
l do. lt feels like
how love should be--
floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat, playing a violin.
Well, yes.
Happiness isn't happiness
without a violin-playing goat.
You have big feet.
Yes.
Yes, always have had.
You know what they say
about men with big feet.
No.
What's that ?
Uh, big feet,
large... shoes.
The thing that is so irritating...
is that now l'm so fierce
when it comes to nudity clauses.
You actually have... clauses
in your contract about nudity ?
Definitely.
""You may show the dent of the top of the
artist's buttocks, but neither cheek.""
Or if there's
a stunt bottom being used...
""artist must have full consultation.""
- You have a stunt bottom ?
- l could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Are people tempted to go
for better bottoms than their own?
Yeah. l would.
This is important stuff.
lt's one hell of a job, isn't it ?
What do you put on your passport ?
""Profession: Mel Gibson's bottom.""
Actually, Mel does his own ass work.
- Right.
- Why wouldn't he ?
- Absolutely.
- lt's delicious.
What, the ice cream
or Mel Gibson's bottom ?
Both. Equally.
But you wouldn't necessarily lick both ?
Well, this is tart.
And fuzz-free.
And, uh--
Bedroom.
There's clean sheets.
Today's been a good day,
which in the circumstances is...
unexpected.
Thank you.
Anyway, um,
time for bed.
Or sofa bed.
Good night.
Good night.
Oh, my God.
Hello ?
Hello.
-Spike.
-l wonder if l could have a little word.
- Right.
- l don't want to interfere or anything,
but she's just split up
from her boyfriend, right ?
- Maybe.
- And she's in your house.
- Yes.
- And you get on very well.
- Yes.
- Well, isn't this, perhaps,
a nice opportunity to...
slip her one.
Spike, for God's sakes.
She's in trouble. Get a grip.
You think it's the wrong moment.
Fair enough.
- Do you mind if l have a go ?
- Spike !
- Okay.
- l'll talk to you in the morning.
Okay.
Might be too late, but okay.
Please, sod off.
- Okay. All right.
- No. No, no !
Wait ! l thought you were,
um, someone else.
l thought you were Spike.
l'm thrilled that you're not.
Wow.
What ?
Nothing.
lt does strike me as,
well, surreal that l'm allowed
to see you naked.
- You and every person in this country.
- l'm sorry.
What is it about men and nudity, huh ?
Particularly breasts.
- How can you be so interested in them ?
- Well--
But, seriously,
they're just breasts.
Every second person
in the world has them.
More than that, when you think about it.
Meat Loaf has a very nice pair.
But they're odd-looking.
They're for milk.
Your mother has them.
You've seen a thousand of them.
What's all the fuss about ?
Actually, l can't think
what it is, really.
Let me just have a quick look.
Nope, nope. Beats me.
Rita Hayworth used to say,
""They go to bed with Gilda,
they wake up with me.""
- Who was Gilda ?
- Her most famous part.
Men went to bed with the dream,
and they didn't like it
when they woke up with the reality.
Do you feel that way ?
You are lovelier this morning
than you have ever been.
l'll be right back.
Breakfast in bed.
- Oh.
- Or it's brunch or lunch or something.
My God.
Can l stay a bit longer ?
Stay forever.
Okay.
Oh. Forgot the jam.
l'll get the jam,
you get the door.
Jesus Christ.
What ?
What is it ?
- Nothing, really.
- You're up to something.
Anna, no, please !
My God. And they got a picture of you
dressed like that.
Yes.
Undressed like this, yeah.
- Morning, darling ones.
- lt's me. The press are here.
No, there are hundreds of them.
My brilliant plan
was not so brilliant. l know.
l know. l know.
Just get over here.
Damn it.
- Um, l wouldn't go outside.
- Why not ?
- Just take my word for it.
- Oh.
How did l look ?
Not bad.
Not at all bad.
Well-chosen briefs, l'd say.
Chicks love grey.
Nice firm buttocks.
How are you doing ?
How do you think l'm doing ?
- l don't know what happened.
- l do.
Your furry friend thought he'd make
a buck telling the papers where l was.
- That's not true.
- Really ?
The entire British press
got up this morning and thought,
""l know where Anna Scott is.
She's in that house with the blue door
in Notting Hill.''
Then you go out
in your goddam underwear !
-l went out in my goddam underwear too.
-Get out !
Sorry.
- l'm so sorry.
- This is such an unbelievable mess.
l come to you to protect myself
against more crappy gossip,
and now l've landed in it
all over again.
For God's sake, l've got a boyfriend !
- You have ?
- As far as they're concerned l do.
And now, tomorrow there'll be
pictures of you in every newspaper
from here to Timbuktu !
l know that, but...
just let's stay calm.
You stay calm ! This is a perfect
situation for you, isn't it?
Minimum input, maximum publicity.
Everywhere you go, people will say,
""Well done, you.
You slept with that actress.
We saw the pictures.''
- That is spectacularly unfair.
- That's yours.
Maybe it'll even help business.
Buy a boring book about Egypt
from the guy that screwed Anna Scott.
Stop ! Stop ! l beg you !
Calm down.
How about a cup of tea ?
l don't want
a goddam cup of tea.
l just wanna go home.
Spike, see who that is,
and put some clothes on, for God's sake.
Looks like a chauffeur to me.
Spike owes you
an expensive dinner or holiday,
depending who's got the brains
to get the going rate on betrayal.
That is not true.
Wait a minute.
This is crazy behaviour.
Can't we just
laugh about all this ?
Seriously. ln the huge sweep of things,
this stuff doesn't matter.
What he's gonna say next is
there's people starving in the Sudan.
Well, there are, and we don't
have to go anywhere near that far.
My best friend slipped down stairs,
cracked her back...
and she's in a wheelchair
for the rest of her life.
All l'm asking for is
a normal amount of perspective.
You're right.
Of course, you're right.
lt's just that l've dealt
with this garbage for ten years.
You've had it for ten minutes.
Our perspectives are very different.
Today's newspapers will be lining
tomorrow's wastepaper bin.
- Excuse me ?
- You know.
lt's just one day.
Tomorrow, today's papers
will all have been thrown out.
You really don't get it.
This story will be filed.
Every time anyone writes anything
about me, they'll dig up these photos.
Newspapers last forever.
l'll regret this forever.
Right.
Right.
l will feel the opposite,
if that's okay by you, and, uh,
always be glad that you...
came to stay.
But, um, you're probably right.
You better go.
Was it you ?
l may have told a few people
down at the pub.
Right.
Have l got something for you. Something
which will make you love me so much,
you will want to hug me every day
for the rest of my life.
Blimey. What is it ?
Phone number of Anna Scott's agent
in London...
and her agent in New York.
Listen, you think about her all
the time. Now you can ring her.
Yeah. Brilliant. Thanks.
l'll see you tonight.
Hey, Marty. Ooh ! Sexy cardi.
Shh ! Hello !
l have a little speech to make.
l won't stand up because
l can't... be bothered.
Exactly a year ago today, this man here
started the finest restaurant in London.
- Hear, hear.
- Thank you very much.
Unfortunately,
no one ever came to eat here.
lt's a tiny hiccup.
And so we have to face the fact
that from next week,
we must find somewhere new to eat.
l just want to say to Tony...
don't take it personally.
The more l think about things, the more
l see no rhyme or reason in life.
No one knows why some things work out
and some things don't.
Why some of us get lucky...
- and some of us--
- Get fired.
- What ?
- No !
Yeah, well, it seems
they're shifting the whole outfit...
much more towards
the emerging markets.
And, of course, well,
l was total crap, so--
A toast to Bernie-- the worst
stockbroker in the whole world.
l thank you.
And Tony, the worst restaurateur.
- Tony and Bernie. Both crap...
- The terrible two.
in their own special ways.
Since it's an evening
of announcements,
uh, l've also got one.
Um, l've decided to get engaged.
l've found myself a nice,
slightly odd-looking bloke...
who l know is gonna make me happy
for the rest of my life.
Wait a sec. l mean, l--
l'm your brother. l don't know
anything about this. ls he--
ls he financially viable ?
He's an artist...
with brilliant prospects.
This is a secret
you've been keeping from me.
By the way, it's you.
- Me ?
- What do you think ?
Well, yeah.
Groovy.
Excuse me.
Are there any more announcements ?
Well, actually, yes.
l feel l should
apologize to everyone...
for my behaviour
over the last six months.
l have, as you know,
been somewhat down in the mouth.
There's an understatement.
There are dead people on better form.
But l just wish to make it clear
that l've turned a corner,
and, um, henceforward intend
to be impressively happy.
Without a love of my own
-Blue moon
-Ba-boom, ba-boom
You knew just what l was there for
Oh, God. l'm horribly drunk.
You heard me saying a prayer for
- Come here.
-Ba-boom, ba-boom
Someone l really could care for
So you've laid the ghost ?
l believe l have.
Don't give a damn
about the famous girl?
No.
No, l don't think l do.
Which means you won't be distracted
by the fact that she's back in London...
grasping her Oscar...
and currently to be found filming,
most days, on Hampstead Heath.
Oh, God, no.
So not over her, in fact.
- Can l help you ?
- Yeah, l'm, um--
- l'm looking for Anna Scott.
- Does she know you're coming ?
No. No, uh, she doesn't.
- l'm afraid l can't let you through.
- Right.
l mean, l am actually a friend.
l'm not a lunatic, but--
- No, you basically, er--
- Can't let you through, sir.
Well, this is, uh--
l only found out
you were here yesterday.
- l was going to call, but l--
- Uh, Anna.
Yes. Um--
Things aren't going very well,
and it's our last day.
Absolutely, yeah.
You're clearly very busy.
But if-- if you could wait,
there are... things to say.
Okay.
Drink tea.
There's lots of tea.
Come and have a look.
Are you a fan of Henry James ?
- This is a Henry James film ?
- Yeah.
This is, uh, Harry.
He'll give you a pair of headphones
so you can hear the dialogue.
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.
- Hi.
- Hi. Here we go.
- Volume's on the side. Have a seat.
- Thank you.
We are living in cloud cuckoo land.
We'll never get this done today.
We've got to.
l have to be in New York on Thursday.
Oh, stop showing off.
God, that's an enormous ass.
- l'm not listening.
- But seriously, it's not fair.
So many tragic young teenagers
with anorexia...
and that girl has an ass
she could perfectly well share around...
with at least ten other women
and still be big-bottomed.
l would think, looking at
something nice like that,
you and your...
bony little excuse for an arse...
would be well advised to keep quiet.
Now down to business.
The end of the scene.
Um, l ask you when you're
telling everyone, and you say--
Um, tomorrow will be soon enough.
And then l-- Right. Okay.
Say, who was that rather diffident chap
l saw you talking to round the back ?
No one.
Just some guy from the past. l--
lt's a bit of an awkward situation.
l don't know what he's doing here.
'Course.
Thanks. l've got to, um--
Any time.
Ladies and gentlemen,
can we have you on your first marks ?
On your first marks !
Uh, l-l do hate to disturb you
whilst you're cooking the books,
but, uh, there's a delivery for you.
Martin, really.
Can't you just do it yourself ?
But you see, this is not for the shop.
This is for you.
Right. Okay.
Tell me, if l employ a wet rag, would l
have to pay it as much as l pay you ?
Hi.
Hello.
You disappeared.
Yeah. Yeah. Um--
l had to leave.
l didn't want to disturb.
- How have you been ?
- Fine, fine. Everything much the same.
When they change the law,
Spike and l will marry immediately.
Whereas you, l've watched in wonder.
- Awards, glory.
- Oh, no.
lt's-- lt's all nonsense, believe me.
l'd no idea how much nonsense
it was, but...
nonsense it all is.
Well, um--
Yesterday was our last day of filming,
so... l'm leaving.
But, um--
l brought this for you from home,
so l thought l'd give it to you.
Thank you.
Shall l--
Oh, no, don't open it now.
l'll be embarrassed.
Well, thank you. l don't know
what it's for, but thanks anyway.
Actually, l had it in my apartment,
and l thought you'd--
But when it came to it,
l didn't know how to call,
having behaved so badly.
Twice.
So it's just been
sitting in the hotel.
Then you came and... l figured--
The thing is--
The thing is--
What ? What is the thing ?
Don't even think about it.
Go away immediately.
- Go away.
- Right.
Sorry.
You were saying ?
Yes.
l have to go away today, but l...
wondered if l didn't...
whether you might
let me see you a little,
or... a lot, maybe.
See if you could like me again.
But yesterday
that actor asked you who l was,
and you just
dismissed me out of hand.
l heard.
You had a microphone.
l had headphones.
You expect me
to tell the truth about my life...
to the most indiscreet man
in England ?
Uh, excuse me.
lt's your mother on the phone.
Will you tell her
l'll ring her back ?
l've actually tried that tack, but
she said you've said that once before,
and it's now been about 24 hours...
and the foot that was purple
is now sort of blackish in colour and--
Right, right. Yeah.
Perfect timing, as ever.
Martin, hold the fort a second.
Uh, yes. All right.
Um, could l just say--
l thought Ghost
was the most wonderful film.
- ls that right ?
- Oh, yes.
Um, l've always wondered...
what Patrick Swayze's like
in-- in-- in real life.
l can't say that l know Patrick
all that well.
He wasn't that friendly during filming ?
Well, l'm sure he was friendly to
Demi Moore who acted with him in Ghost.
Oh. Oh, right.
Sorry.
Always been a bit of an ass.
Um, anyway-- Um--
Well, it was lovely to meet you.
l'm a huge, huge fan of yours.
And Demi's, of course.
Sorry.
That's fine.
There's always a pause when the jury
goes out to consider their verdict.
Anna, look, um--
l'm a fairly levelheaded bloke,
not often in and out of love.
But, uh--
Can l just say no to your...
kind request and, uh, leave it at that ?
Yes.
Fine. Of course. l--
Of course.
l'll just be going, then.
lt was nice to see you.
The thing is,
with you l'm in real... danger.
lt seems like a... perfect situation,
apart from that
foul temper of yours, but...
my relatively inexperienced heart
would, l fear, not...
recover, uh, if l was...
once again cast aside,
as l would absolutely expect to be.
There are just too many pictures of you,
too many films.
You'd go and l'd be, uh,
well, buggered, basically.
That really is a real no, isn't it ?
l live in Notting Hill.
You live in... Beverly Hills.
Everyone in the world
knows who you are.
My mother has trouble
remembering my name.
Fine.
Fine. Good decision.
Good decision.
The fame thing isn't really real,
you know ?
And don't forget l'm--
l'm also just a girl...
standing in front of a boy...
asking him to love her.
Goodbye.
So what do you think ?
Good move ?
Yeah, good move.
l mean, when all's said and done,
she's nothing special.
l saw her taking her trousers down,
and l definitely glimpsed
some cellulite down there.
Good decision, yeah.
All actresses are as mad as snakes.
- Tones, what do you reckon ?
- Never met her, never want to.
- Brilliant. Max ?
- Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
Great. Thanks. Brilliant.
l was called and l came. What's up ?
William's just turned down Anna Scott.
You daft prick.
No, no.
No, no, it's actually quite sensible.
That painting
isn't the original, is it ?
Um, you know,
l think it might be, yeah.
But she said
she wanted to go out with you.
- Yeah.
- Well, that's nice.
What ?
Well, you know,
anyone saying they wanna go out with you
is pretty great, isn't it ?
lt was...
sort of... sweet, actually.
Um, l mean,
l know she's an actress and all that...
so she can... deliver a line, but, um,
she said she might be
as famous as she can be,
but also that she was...
just a girl...
standing in front of a boy...
asking him... to love her.
Oh, sod a dog. l've made
the wrong decision, haven't l ?
Yeah.
Max, how fast is your car ?
- Good luck !
- lf anyone gets in our way,
we have small nuclear devices.
- Where to ?
- All l can think is The Ritz.
- Where's Bella ?
- She's not coming.
- Oh, sod that. Bernie, in the back.
- What ?
Max, l'm okay.
Come on, babe.
Which way are you going ?
Down Kensington Church Street, then
Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
- No, crazy. Go along Bayswater.
- That's right. Then Park Lane.
No, straight down to the Cromwell Road,
then left.
Stop right there !
l will decide the route. All right ?
Sorry, Max.
James Bond never has to put up
with this sort of shit.
Turn right !
- l can't. lt's one way.
- Do a U-turn.
Oh, sod it. Hold on.
Brilliant !
Bloody hell, this is fun !
Sorry.
Hi.
ls Miss Scott staying here ?
- No, sir.
- How 'bout Miss Flintstone ?
- No, sir.
- Uh, Bambi ?
- No, sir.
- Or, um--
l don't know.
Beavis or Butthead ?
No, sir.
Thanks. Thanks.
There was a Miss Pocahontas,
but she checked out
about an hour ago.
l believe she's holding
a press conference at the Savoy...
before flying to America.
We have liftoff.
You have message for Takiama ?
l'll just check, sir.
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.
Stop ! Stop ! Stop !
Stay there ! Go ! Go !
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Hang on !
Come on ! No ! Wait ! Wait there !
Come on ! Come on ! Wait !
Whoa, whoa, whoa ! Go on !
Through, through !
You're my hero !
Whoa ! Down, boy.
Excuse me.
- Yes ?
- Where's the press conference, please ?
- Are you an accredited
member of the press ?
- Yep.
- There you go.
- That's a Blockbuster Video
membership card, sir.
That's right.
l work for their in-house magazine.
- Movies Are Our Business.
- l'm sorry, sir.
- He's with me.
- And you are ?
Writing an article on how London hotels
treat people in wheelchairs.
Yes, of course, madam.
lt's in the Lancaster Room.
Though l'm afraid you're rather late.
Run !
Does this mean that Miss Scott
will not be publicizing her next film ?
No, it absolutely
does not mean that.
She'll be abiding by
all her present commitments.
She just won't be making
any more for the next year.
When will the film be released ?
At the moment,
the plan is to release in America...
towards the end of the autumn,
and over here around Christmas
or early in the new year.
Right ! Dominic.
Anna, how much longer are you
staying in the U.K., then ?
No time at all.
l leave tonight.
Which is why we have to round things
up now, so final questions, please.
Yes. Lady there.
ls your decision to take
a year off anything to do...
with the rumours about Jeff
and his present leading lady ?
- Absolutely not.
- Do you believe the rumours ?
Well, it's really
not my business any more.
Though l will say, from my experience,
rumours about Jeff do tend to be true.
Yeah. The last time you were here, there
were some fairly graphic photographs...
taken of you
with a young English guy.
So, uh, what happened there ?
He was just a friend.
We're still friends, l think.
Right, um--
Yes. Gentleman in the pink shirt.
Yes. Miss Scott,
are there any circumstances in which...
the two of you...
might be more than just good friends ?
l hoped there would be, but no,
l'm... assured there aren't.
- But what would you say if--
- Sorry. Just the one question, please.
No, it's all right.
You were saying ?
l was just wondering if, uh,
it turned out that this person, uh--
Thacker. His name was Thacker.
Thanks, thanks.
l just wondered whether if...
Mr Thacker realized he'd been
a daft prick...
and got down on his knees and...
begged you to reconsider,
whether you would, in fact, then...
reconsider ?
Yes, l believe l would.
That's very good news.
Um--
The readers of Horse & Hound
will be absolutely delighted.
Right. Uh, Dominic, if you'd
like to ask your question again ?
Yeah ? Anna, how long are you
intending to stay here in Britain ?
lndefinitely.
- What happened ?
- lt was good.
