THE BUTCHER
To the population
of TREMOLAT, PÉRIGORD
Hurry up, Maurice!
Dish up the gravy, Odette.
Jolly good gravy!
Get on with your work.
You think only
of yourselves there...
Always the same.
My work's more important.
You're enough to try
a saint's patience.
Roast ready yet?
I hope your beef was good.
You bet! If it isn't...
I'll cut my tongue out.
And we'll eat it...
Let me cut that.
Have a go at that.
What's the joke?
Nothing. It looks all right.
Like in the army...
even when the meat's good...
it tastes like shoe leather.
As the bride's father,
I have to make a speech.
It won't be long
as I don't want to talk nonsense
and my son-in-law
knows a thing or two.
That's the trouble with a teacher.
Pa-in-law has to be careful
what he says.
But I know enough to say
I'm glad about this marriage.
I like young Leon.
He taught my son to read.
And I'm sure he'll make
my daughter happy.
You can count on that!
Give me a kiss.
Now kiss each other.
Funny things marriages.
Don't you think they're funny?
Yes, everybody enjoy themselves.
Then things go wrong.
Not always.
My pals in the army...
They weren't at home.
That's a thought.
They weren't...
Well, no...
I'd like a little Champagne.
May I have some Champagne?
Ask your mother.
She says I can if you say so.
All right. You like it?
I've never tasted it.
Try it.
You're taking a risk.
I like having responsibilities.
He likes you.
Hope so.
They all do.
I like them.
Angelo! A song!
As everybody wants me to, I'll sing.
Won't you waltz?
Why don't we?
I dance like an elephant.
Not as bad as that.
I haven't danced much in 15 years.
Nice people in this town.
Why did you join the army, then?
I'd rather not have.
Nice people here except...
the man who was my father
and he was a rat.
Have you been here long?
Ten years. I knew your father.
Wasn't he a rat?
He was a butcher.
And a bad one, too.
He cut the meat anyhow.
Talk of marriages.
My mother may have been happy...
on her wedding day. Not after.
You never came back?
To see him. No!
I came once
for my mother's funeral...
7 years ago.
I was on holiday in Paris.
You go to Paris for holidays.
Parisians come here.
That's logical.
Like to see you...
I'd have liked it. I'd be a nurse.
There were good times, but...
The rice was good?
The rice was okay,
but the rice fields...
You smoke?
Are you shocked?
No, but...
it's rare for women
to smoke in the street.
It's healthier than smoking
in a house.
That's logical.
You seem to like logic.
I was fifteen years in the army.
That makes you appreciate
two things you haven't got...
Iogic and liberty.
You live over the school?
How long have you been
the headmistress?
Three years...
You're a young headmistress.
Because I'm very good.
You like meat?
I ask because if I come
across special delicacies...
I could bring you some.
Collops or roats, you know...
You see, some animals
are better than others.
What a dream to have a butcher
to select your meat for you.
I'm very pleased.
By the way, tell me...
does a butcher learn his trade?
You bet he does.
I was a butcher with my father
and then...
when I joined the army,
they made me...
a butcher there, too.
I've butchered in Algeria,
Indo-China...
Hard work!
Soldiers have appetites.
Yes, that's logical.
Well, here you are. I'll be off.
So long, Paul.
Thanks for bringing me.
Goodbye, Miss Helen.
Leon, how sulky you look!
I'd rather have stayed home.
Not fed up with marriage already?
God no! Not yet!
I hope you'll be happy.
Thank you.
Nice to go home to your wife
after work.
I'll go for lunch.
Good idea!
Come along, children.
Five minutes late.
In honour of Mr Hamel's wedding.
Well, are you deaf?
Are you deaf?
Riri's father told him
the postman said...
that a dead woman has been
found in the woods.
What's all this?
It's true. The police...
...there emanated
an air of greatness... comma...
a majestic firmness...
and profound feeling...
such as to...
impress the coarsest...
coarsest of minds...
full stop... Honoré de Balzac.
I'll write it down.
You know who Balzac was?
A writer.
A 19th Century novelist
whose work constitutes...
a picture of the society of his day.
I'll read the dictation again.
"When she heard the bedroom
door open, Helen..."
Now don't laugh.
"Helen rose from the divan
on which she was lying.
"She saw the Marquis...
"and cried out.
"She was so changed
that her father...
"scarcely knew her.
"The tropical sun had bronzed
her face, giving her...
"a marvellous hue...
"a poetical expression from which...
"there emanated an air of greatness,
"a majestic firmness
and profound feeling...
"such as to impress
the coarsest of minds."
- I disturb you?
- Not a bit.
I shouldn't come
during school hours.
Tell me if it annoys you.
Not at all. Well?
I've brought a leg...
That's nice.
A leg of lamb. Look!
A good one.
Would you help me
collect the books?
That's where I sat.
Were you a good pupil?
French and History were all right...
but not the problems
about taps filling a tank.
Our teacher wasn't as nice as you.
The old hag!
Her name was Cowden... with a cow.
Don't be disrespectful.
A real bitch she was!
You mustn't hear any more.
Stand up!
Class dismiss.
In an orderly manner.
They'll hear plenty more.
But Miss Cowden would never have
let me bring meat to her in school.
You've got a fridge?
Well, goodbye.
Wait! I must go to the baker.
If you don't think it's indiscreet
come and share the lamb.
What is it?
I didn't expect that.
It's no fun having
a leg of lamb alone.
Well, will you?
Of course!
When shall I come?
Come along about 7.
Good. I've time on my hands now.
I've little to do.
I do the buying... my assistant
looks after the shop.
And business is very quiet just now.
What's up?
A policeman from Périgueux.
There's been a crime.
A crime?
The Gaillotin girl's been knifed.
Dead!
And to think she danced with Jean.
I've not seen her since.
Who can have done it?
Oh, some tramp!
A small loaf, please.
Sorry, I was wool-gathering.
There'll be cops here for weeks...
Probably.
Gives us something to talk about.
To my account?
Too soon?
No, I said seven.
The door's open. Come up.
You're very punctual...
Like Louis XIV.
I've still some correcting.
I'm too early.
Not at all...
- Have a drink?
- Don't trouble.
No trouble.
I can go without.
I've drunk plenty in my time.
Shall I sit here?
Or there!
I'm all right.
Just five minutes.
Must be fun teaching children.
Yes, it's a good job.
May I smoke?
You smoke Gauloises?
What do you think of this?
"It was so hot the air hurt you..."
Dunno. Any good?
Well... I think it is...
I wouldn't know.
That's done with.
Shall I cook dinner?
We could go to the cinema then.
You like films?
Not war films... disgusting.
I was at war for 15 years.
I'd be a fool
if war films amused me.
Why stay in the army then?
Just because I was a fool.
I've seen a thing or two.
And they weren't pretty to see.
Well, it isn't a war film tonight.
Shall I start?
It's there.
Over the landing?
Here's my kitchenette.
- Magnificent!
- Yes, I like it a lot.
There've been cops here all day.
A girl's been murdered at St Albert.
Yes, I've heard.
They've found no trace
of the killer.
What's it weigh?
2 lbs... half an hour...
No garlic?
Never garlic in lamb!
Shall I make a salad?
Why should you do the work?
Making fun of me?
Eggs hard-boiled?
What sign of the Zodiac?
Libra... the Scales...
So I throw my weight about.
What's yours?
Scorpion.
How d'you mean?
That's a bad sign!
There are no bad signs.
Need anything?
No thanks...
Oh, a small knife.
I've only got my van
to take you to town.
I have my 2 CV.
Why do you laugh?
You must look funny in your 2 CV.
You've never seen me.
Hallo, Paul, a small collop please.
Congratulations. The exam.
Your brother passed it.
But only with your help.
Oh, nonsense!
There they are!
Apparently they've found a clue.
The gendarmes are there.
They've found...
Think of the poor girl...
I've seen a corpse or two
with their heads in the mud.
I've seen two or three
piled together.
I've seen old women like her
torn to bits.
I've seen my own pals rotting
and eaten by worms.
War is a terrible thing.
But a murder like this
one is a foul, savage act.
We used to count corpses
by heaps...
What I say is...
How much is that?
I'll chalk it up?
There they are again!
Mr La Hire, may I raid
your collection of costumes...
for the school show?
Of course, take whatever you want.
Shall I be in the show?
Yes, as I said.
I love playing the fool.
The joint of veal there!
Thanks. Put it on my account.
What is it for you, Madam?
Give it?
Whatever you want.
Minced beef.
Why not a steak?
No thanks.
- It'd give you strength.
- Next time then.
Coming mushrooming with us
this afternoon?
I promised Charles and Lisette.
- What time?
- About four.
I may not have finished.
Join us afterwards then.
Wait for me. I'll find him.
We're in the oak copse.
Made a good haul?
But that's terrific!
I smell 'em out.
Children, come and look
at Paul's mushrooms!
I've found one too.
Think you've done enough work?
I like to watch you...
with the children.
Can we play over there?
Well?
Miss Helen, there's one thing
I've noticed.
Generally, school teachers
are known by their surname.
The others... I didn't
know their first names.
With you it's the opposite.
You're Miss Helen.
And I'm not the only one...
What is your surname?
Daville.
Helen Daville...
My questions annoy you?
Not at all.
May I ask you something else?
I'm afraid
it's a more delicate question.
Ask it anyhow.
Don't answer if you don't want.
Don't worry about that.
I think I know what you'll ask.
I promise to reply.
I'll dive in then.
Why haven't you any... any lovers?
Because I don't want any.
I understand...
but that's just the point...
why don't you?
Because I had an unhappy affair
ten years ago.
I was very much in love
with a man who made me happy.
It went on for months...
then one day he left me.
It made me ill.
I took a long time to get over it.
That's why I came here
as a school teacher.
Now I am happy again.
I don't say you're not happy
but it's not normal.
Yes, it's quite normal.
There are simple ways
of doing without it.
But that's disgusting!
I'm not in the least worried.
I love the children like my own.
I'm not convinced...
And anyhow...
I know quite well what I'm doing.
I find it wonderful
that people can meet...
make love... and so on...
But I don't want to risk it.
I know making love
is not always pleasant...
but never doing it makes you mad.
But doing it can make you mad too.
That's the point.
But, damn it all, if I asked you...
if I kissed you, what then?
I'd say nothing...
but I ask you not to.
Have you that packet?
Yes, here it is.
It's for you.
A present?
What occasion?
What's the date today?
My birthday!
How wonderful!
Look your partner in the eyes.
Don't play the fool, Charles.
How handsome!
A trifle.
Think now.
Close your mouth!
Stand straight, Pascal.
Come now.
Stand up straight.
Not like that!
Bow to each other, there!
You must understand
that the instincts...
feelings...
and even the intelligence
of Cro-Magnon man...
were definitely human.
The only difference was
his subsistence problem.
What is subsistence?
Staying alive.
He began to draw.
Do you know what
desires are called...
when they're not savage?
Aspirations...
If Cro-Magnon had not survived,
you wouldn't be there today.
Be careful how you go.
S'posing Cro-Magnon
came back now...
He might adapt himself
to our way of life...
or he might die.
I don't want him to die.
He sounds very nice.
Perhaps.
Hold each other's hands.
Everyone got sandwiches?
I have chocolate buns
for the hungry ones.
Now, not too fast there!
Sit down here.
I'd like a chocolate bun.
It's raining?
Of course not. Look at the sky.
It's red.
Blood! She's bleeding!
I'm frightened. I'm frightened!
Stay where you are. I'll be back.
Go away, Charles!
Try once again.
Miss Daville?
I'm an Inspector.
I'd like to ask you something.
Périgueux has asked for assistance.
I came by train.
Let's go in here.
Your classroom?
You're young for a headmistress.
But they all like you.
You'll allow me?
Périgueux's out of its depth.
Two crimes like this.
They're right to pass the buck.
Not easy to solve...
sadistic crimes.
So you found the body...
I read the statement
you made last night.
Bad shock for the kids.
The one with blood on her...
One thing I'd ask you...
They did the autopsy last night.
She was killed... not raped...
not raped...
unusual... very odd, in fact.
She was killed just before
you found her.
The blood was wet.
I'd like to know if you heard any...
suspicious noises before...
the blood dropped.
You never thought
there was someone...
No... but...
You were going to say...
We'd just left the caves.
I heard and saw nothing.
And the kids?
I haven't asked them, but I don't...
Well, we'll see about it later.
Obviously, you couldn't imagine...
Tell the little ones
to come in here.
Mr Hamel won't be coming today.
You little ones to the back.
Some of you there...
Now listen, children...
did anyone who took part
in the outing hear or see...
anything unusual?
No, sir!
Now don't invent anything.
Tell the truth.
They don't tell lies.
We didn't hear anything...
Can we talk somewhere else?
In the yard?
Charles, take over for me.
Now shut up, as Miss Helen said.
You're very calm and collected.
It must have been very frightening.
Before you go, please...
think very hard.
Have you the slightest idea
of a clue that might help us?
It is quite certain that
somewhere not necessarily here...
but in the neighbourhood...
there is a madman.
Understand?
Yes, but I cannot help you.
Between ourselves, what about...
her husband... Leon Hamel?
It's quite unthinkable!
If you only knew what we see...
and what human nature can be...
I won't keep you any longer.
I'll just stew in my own juice.
Can I phone?
I'm sorry, but it's too early.
The post office isn't open yet.
Up-to-date, eh?
The telephone's not mine...
It dates from the Ark!
Everything all right?
I'll give you something to draw.
Miss Helen, may I come up?
What is it, Paul?
I've been in Périgueux.
Surprise for you.
Come up then.
Look what I've brought you.
Cherries in brandy...
but the real stuff!
Big, eh? You like them?
Very much.
What? Not feeling well?
Yes, but a little tired.
Can we try them?
Sit down. I'll get the glasses.
You're worn out...
with all this business.
A little spirit...
Best I've ever had.
Good, aren't they?
What d'you think?
Marvellous.
First time
I've seen you out of sorts.
Funny!
No, not funny.
Yes it is. Don't worry, Paul.
I'm not a complete and utter brute.
The poor kids...
and poor Mr Hamel. Terrible!
He didn't come today.
That gives you double
the amount of work.
You ought to take a holiday.
I'm strong enough.
I hope so, but...
If you'd seen her...
I thought of all those corpses
you talked about.
It couldn't have been worse.
You mustn't think of it.
Think of her as she was
the day of her wedding.
She'd had a few drinks...
You're tired...
and you're crying.
Dry your eyes.
I saw some good lambs
at Périgueux...
Excuse me...
I can't help myself.
I'm going to paint this room.
Needs it, doesn't it?
Now stop crying.
It's over now.
Got a light?
Ah, that's better.
It's my lighter!
Of course it is.
Works well, too.
Not going to begin again, are you?
Not quite the same now.
Would you like me to go away?
No, please stay.
I need you.
That's the last straw.
I loved her so much.
- You know Paul Thomas?
- We know each other.
I had to question him too.
Can we go down together?
Of course.
This is a frightful business.
Not a clue nor a lead of any sort.
Not an indication.
It's a tragedy.
It's the same sadist
as did the other.
Same sort of wounds... no rape.
He'll do it again for sure.
And go on until we arrest him...
if we ever do.
We can't arrest everybody here
and he may not be from here.
And the weapon...
apparently a flick-knife.
Everyone has them here.
I'm going to Miss Helen's.
Not finished yet?
Ceiling still to do.
Do problem n°5 on page 72.
A train leaves Orléans...
- What's this?
- Trains...
You must try to get on.
I'll do the ceiling.
What a mess!
Soon be finished.
I hope so.
'Night, Leon.
How's things?
Not bad.
Till tomorrow.
Tomorrow's Sunday.
Till Monday then.
Poor chap.
He's very unhappy.
I'm going shopping.
Back in an hour.
Charles, go and work.
And no chatting, the two of you.
No, Miss Helen.
More problems of trains and taps...
Poor chap!
Is it coming out?
No...
can you help me?
If only I could...
Blast!
What?
I've split some paint.
You need turpentine.
- Where is it?
- In the cupboard.
You know where everything is.
The time I've spent on trains...
And the clean rags?
In the drawer there.
Mr Thomas, can I read you...
my problem?
It won't do much good.
"A train leaves Orléans at 2:37...
"it runs at 50 m.p.h.
For the first 30 miles...
"and then at 70 m.p. H...
"for the rest of the journey.
"Another train leaves Toulouse
at 2:43...
"it runs at 40 m.p.h.
For the first 50 miles...
"and at 76 m.p.h. After.
The two trains meet at 5:45.
"How far is Toulouse from Orléans?"
Do you know how far?
That'd help.
You don't know how far?
I never have understood
those problems.
- I was just leaving.
- Already?
I've finished the first coat.
It must dry.
Shall I clear up?
No, don't worry.
There's been another murder.
A girl knifed to death
behind a gate...
You heard?
I was at Bergerac.
Another girl's been found dead.
She was found...
Not astonishing.
Why should it stop?
Why should it stop suddenly?
No, I suppose you're right.
See you tomorrow.
Been another crime?
Yes...
but don't worry about that.
And the problem?
I can't get it out.
Do you understand the principle?
I don't know.
You work out the distance covered
by each train and add them.
I don't get it...
It's easy. Have a go.
Well, and so...
I find one train
has gone 229 miles...
That should be it.
Charles, have you been
to this drawer?
No, Miss, it was Mr Paul
who wanted a rag.
That's good.
You must be tired.
It's Sunday tomorrow.
Anyhow, you understand
the problem, eh?
You can go.
Miss Helen!
Let me in.
I want to see you.
Just a minute...
I beg of you.
I want to tell you something.
Tomorrow. I've got a headache.
But it's important.
But really, I'm not well.
Tomorrow morning...
come along tomorrow morning.
But it's important.
Miss Helen... It's me.
I put out the light.
I came through the woodshed.
Keep still and listen.
You found the lighter.
So you knew it was me.
When I knew I'd lost it...
I tried to buy another.
I spent all day at Périgueux
to find the same...
so you wouldn't notice.
But as you'd found it...
That's how I kill them...
with this knife.
I can't stop myself.
Like a nightmare.
I can't breathe until I've...
stuck my knife into her.
I understand.
You can trust me, Paul.
Don't speak.
It can never be the same.
The shame is terrible.
I can't bear to see you.
I know I horrify you...
and I can't stand that. I can't.
Miss Helen, help me!
What have you done?
I've killed myself.
Help me!
Don't move!
Stay where you are!
Unclench your fist.
Squeeze. Squeeze it tight.
I'll take you to hospital.
Don't tell them who I am.
No... don't speak.
Hurry up!
Hurry up! My blood's leaving me.
Be quiet.
No, I'd better speak.
I've thought of you...
night after night.
I've spent hours looking
at your window.
There was only you.
When I saw your eyes...
I forgot...
who I was.
I only lived for you.
Please don't talk.
You can't stop me.
I'd have liked to take you
in my arms.
I'd have liked to be...
with you always.
To protect you.
I'd have liked to take you...
away to a desert island.
What a long way!
How long it takes!
I've a lot of blood.
It keeps on flowing.
I know about blood.
I've seen lots...
of blood flowing.
You made me forget about...
blood flowing.
I don't know if I'll last...
I'm bleeding so.
When I was a kid...
I couldn't stand blood.
You've noticed the smell of blood?
They're all the same.
The blood of animals
and the blood of men...
some are redder than others...
but they all smell exactly the same.
How long it takes!
Be quiet!
We've arrived!
Miss Helen...
kiss me!
He's dead, Miss.
At the top,
he cried out Miss Helen...
and then he died.
You're tired. Go home.
We'll do the papers later.
