- What?
This way!
Watch it!
What are you doing!
Hey, look. l'm really sorry.
Come on, Reþat!
Let's go!
How could he do a runner?
Reþat!
- How could he do a runner?
- l don't know.
What are we going to tell them back home?
"Mala Ahmet did a runner." Huh?
- What are we going to say?
- What are we going to do, Ali?
Get moving! Come on!
So theyjust brought you here
and left you. You too, huh?
Friends!
We have a new guest.
Come in, sir.
Please come in.
Why don't you have a seat
over here?
Here. Have some water.
You'll feel better.
Listen. Don't upset yourself.
We were dumped here too.
Overtime, we've all got
used to being here.
Once you get to know us
once you're used to the place...
...you'll love it.
Nuri!
Don't you recogniZe me, Nuri?
lt's me, Ayþe.
Dad! The phone!
- Hello?
- Hello! Hello?
There's no coverage out there.
Hello?
Who is this? Why are they calling
ifthey don't say anything?
You don't think it's Ali?
Ali?
Ali, this way!
Come on! Move it!
Nuri, it's Ayþe.
YourAyþe.
Ayþe, this isn't your husband.
You're getting him confused.
No, no.
lt's my husband. Nuri.
Ayþe, maybe he just
looks like him.
Attention!
Pull that stomach in!
l'm Vahit iZgi, major in the
Turkish Armed Forces, retired.
l'm from Sivas.
l arrived here five months ago.
A warm welcome to you!
l'm Yorgo.
l'm Greek and from lstanbul.
l was a tailor in my time.
l've been here for 11 years.
l'm delighted to meet you.
l'm Melek.. Melek Cansever.
l was a nurse. l come from Ankara.
That's all.
Welcome to your new home.
Melek Haným sometimes talks to us
and sometimes to the angels.
She's an angel just like her name.
But we treasure her enormously.
l'm Yaþar Sarýkaya.
l'm from Edirne.
l'm a retired teacherwho taught
his pupils all about life and love.
But l'm afraid these are things
l failed to teach my own kids.
lt's a pleasure to meet you.
Abla, this is all fine and good
but the man hasn't said a word yet.
He'll settle in. We were hardly talkative
in those first days.
My real name's Nebahat
and my stage name Jale.
After years of singing in nightclubs
l was brought here to take things easy.
But here, l've been having
the happiest time of my life.
l sing for my beloved now.
Welcome!
Nebahat Haným's a plainspoken woman.
She's a bit like a man in that way.
Like everyone else here,
she's a wonderful person.
And she's the light of my life!
- Soldier!
- Yes, sir!
lntroduce yourself!
l'm Cemal Kara, a Korea veteran...
...ofthe First Turkish Brigade,
First Division, First Company.
l was born in 1920 in Kayseri.
On 25 September 1950...
...l left with the First Brigade
in the good ship Mcrea...
...and we sailed to
Korea in 21 days.
- OK, soldier. OK.
- The Americans awarded...
- Enough, soldier! Enough!
- They awarded our company a star.
My closest friend, a Korean..
Welcome, sir.
Let me introduce myself.
l'm a composer and violinist,
Hadji Murat Ünyaylar.
l'm originally from Adana.
l've accompanied all the
great musicians including Zeki Muren.
But... l can't play any more.
l'm Ayþe.
l've waited for you so long, Nuri!
- Welcome!
- Ayþe dear, don't do this.
- But... But it's him.
- No, it isn't.
That's Perihan...
...the lady lying overthere.
And the cat in her lap is Pamuk.
l think Pamuk was brought here
by her mother.
- Good morning, everyone!
- Good morning!
- How are you today?
- Fine.
Good morning, ilhan Bey.
You're in good health, l hope.
That's ilhan the LaZ.
He doesn't talk.
No one's ever got him to say a word.
Not even Tayyar Bey, the director here.
Do we have a guest here?
No, he's not a guest, Tayyar Bey.
l found him on the doorstep.
He'd just been left there.
- Welcome to our home!
- But we don't have room, Tayyar Bey.
There's another patient arriving today,
you know.
They're not patients, Kadir Haným.
They're guests. Guests!
Tayyar Bey, l don't want to
speak out ofturn...
But suppose we put the gentleman
in the infirmary tonight?
My room will be free tomorrow,
as you know.
Of course!
lt's the wedding's tomorrow, isn't it?
- God willing..
- Absolutely. Let's do that.
We'll put him in the infirmary tonight
and deal with the formalities later.
- Have a good day!
- You too!
Yaþar Hodja! Come over here.
We need a fourth playerfor dominoes.
- Selam aleykum.
- Aleykum selam.
Abi, what is this place?
lt's a nursing home.
What are you looking for?
- What kind of home did you say, Abi?
- A nursing home.
You know, old people..
lt's a place where they live.
- Did you say old people, Abi?
- Aha.
Abi, we're looking for someone old.
Can we see if he's there?
OK. Go ahead.
Maybe you'll find him there.
Thanks a lot, Abi.
Come on, Reþat!
- Yorgo..
- Yes?
- Don't bother, Yorgo.
- What?
l've got the double six!
Bravo, soldier!
Here. And this is from me!
- lt's a dead end for Kayseri, this!
- God forbid, Cemal!
Reþat, we've found him!
Not now.
Sorry, Abi.
What did you say this place was?
A nursing home.
So is a nursing home
something like a hospital?
No, my friend.
A nursing home is a home for old people
who need taking care of.
l see, Abi.
There's my friend.
Good luck to you guys.
Thanks, Abi.
We're going to get
a present for Grandpa, aren't we?
Shhh! What did l say, honey?
lf your dad hears..
- A present for Grandpa..
- Yes, we are. l already told.
Selim!
Aren't you ready yet?
l'm already late forwork.
Don't wait for us. l have to call
by at the district council.
l'll drop Buse at nursery
on my way to work.
Daddy's little girl..
And one here.
Don't be too late.
- Soldier!
- l'm Cemal Kara. A Korea veteran...
...ofthe First Turkish Brigade,
First Division, First Company.
l was born in 1922 in Kayseri.
- On 25 September 1950...
- Soldier!
...l left with the First Brigade...
- Soldier!
- Yes, sir!
Don't report to me. Eat!
- Praise be to God!
- Praise be to God!
- Long live our nation!
- Long live our nation!
Please start.
Yaþar Hodja, you start.
Enjoy the meal, friends.
We must start
the wedding preparations today.
- We're rather late starting.
- Just a simple ceremony is fine.
What do you mean? lt's a wedding!
We want to have fun, don't we?
Yes, we'll hire you a groom's outfit.
And a white wedding dress for Nebahat.
She'll look wonderful in it.
A white wedding dress?
Surely not at my age?
God give me patience!
l'm not your slave!
How many times do l have to tell you
to keep this dining room clean?
Sultan!
Bring Her Majesty Queen Perihan
her breakfast!
Be quick about it
so she can stuff herface!
l hope it's her last ever breakfast.
Swallow!
Get it down you!
Swallow the lot!
Swallow!
God give me patience!
l'm sick of cleaning you up.
You understand? l'm sick of it!
As if cleaning up Her Majesty's shit
wasn't enough on its own...
...l have to clean up
the cat's shit as well!
Shut up, woman! Shut up!
Stop whining, God damn you!
- Abla, please don't get annoyed.
- How can l not get annoyed?
l've been cleaning up sick people's shit
my whole life.
What do l get for it?
To scrape a living.
You think her own kids
have ever cleaned up her shit?
l wish she'd die
and we'd be rid of her.
But Abla, that's ourjob.
Now look here!
Just watch your mouth.
Don't you start telling me
how to do myjob!
- Ali, shall we try calling again?
- OK.
l can't get through.
Mum, please don't do this!
Look, l'll take care of you, OK?
Don't upset yourself, son.
This isn't a bad place.
Besides, it was hard enough
getting a place here.
- Mum, l can't let you stay here.
- Musa, what's the fuss about?
l'm sick anyway. Don't be proud now.
lt's something we have to do.
Then l won't be a burden on you.
But Mum, it's so hard for me.
Here comes your little friend!
He's had his food. Don't worry.
OK. That's me done.
l must go now, Abla.
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Who do we have here?
lt's my princess! Welcome, my love!
Grandpa, l got this for you.
You got this for me?
Thank you so much, darling.
And we got Turkish delight
forthe other grandmas and grandpas.
Good for you! Go on, give it to them.
l'm sure they'll love it.
- My favourite teacher..
- My little duckling! Welcome!
Hello, Amca.
- Well, look who's here!
- How are you, GaZi Dede?
- How are you, Dad?
- Fine, thanks, my love.
- How about you?
- l'm OK.
- ls there anything you need?
- No.
Thank you for bringing
my little princess.
You shouldn't be thanking me, Dad!
l should go.
See you tonight.
- See you laterthen. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Buse, l'll come and get you tonight.
Have a good day, everyone.
Thank you.
How could you lie to me?
How could you make Buse lie to me?
lt's you who forced me to lie.
Buse spent years growing up
in her grandfather's arms.
When his arms couldn't take her
any more we threw him out.
Besides, it's not your parents
we got rid of.
The only consolation for Dad
is Buse's visits.
But you can't even take that.
You want to forget he even exists.
Buse is even scared to call him grandpa
when she's with him.
You didn't exactly give us any choice.
lf you ever make Buse lie to me again...
lf you evertry to come between us...
...you'll regret it.
Think about that.
l've done a lot ofthinking, Selim.
Now it's yourturn.
- Grandpa..
- Yes, princess?
- Hasn't ilhan Dede spoken today either?
- No, he hasn't. Not today either.
- Grandpa..
- Yes, princess?
Why does no one come to visit?
Don't the others have kids or grandkids?
Are you craZy?
Of course they do!
But their kids live
a long, long way away.
You never know though.
Theirfriends can show up any time.
lt's us!
Hey, clowns! Hurray!
Come along! Come with us.
- Grandpa, come along too!
- Coming, darling.
lt's time to say goodbye.
Don't worry, son.
Your mother's in safe hands here.
Now come on, SuZan Haným.
l'll introduce you
to your new friends.
Musa.. Son..
Don't upset yourself, OK?
Look after yourself, Mum.
l'll come and get you
as soon as l find a job, OK?
lnshallah, son! lnshallah.
This way, SuZan Haným.
Tayyar Bey!
Take good care of her.
l'm leaving her in your hands.
Friends!
Let me introduce you to
our new guest. SuZan Haným, come in.
Welcome to your new home, lady.
Come and let's find you a seat.
Welcome!
Welcome to you.
All that suffering is now in the past.
Yes, it's in the past.
ln the past.
But it hasn't got any less.
Not at all.
l don't understand.
l still don't understand.
She faded before my very eyes
and was gone just like that.
lf she'd been alive today,
she'd have been yourZiya's age.
Sister Melek..
You were a beacon of light
in your daughter's short life.
She left her light to you.
Don't blame yourself.
Love and hope...
That's what life is about.
Without them
we really would get old.
My daughterwants me to join her now.
She's calling me.
Melek Haným...
You still talk to the otherworld,
don't you?
Are angels male orfemale?
Angels don't have genders!
They're radiance itself. Light.
Melek Haným...
- Can l ask you another question?
- Of course you can.
ls there life in outer space?
Will Jesus come again? Or Moses?
Will the oceans overflow?
Will the polar ice melt?
- Or is the world going to end?
- Hey!
Are you making fun of me?
Now look here!
l don't know about Jesus and Moses
but you're in for a gigantic beating!
You're like a motherto me.
Buse, my sweet... Come on.
lt's time we left.
l want to stay here, Mum.
Come on, my love.
We're running late.
l want to stay here with Grandpa.
You know you can't. Come on, sweetie.
Please don't be difficult.
Let Grandpa come with us then.
He can sleep in my room.
- l'll look after him.
- Buse, please!
We go through the same thing
every week. Now come on!
But Grandpa used to live with us.
We always played together.
l miss him so much, Mum.
Princess! My little princess..
What's going on?
What are those?
Oh no! Little pearls!
We can't have pearls spilling!
Now let's gatherthem up, my love.
- My princess..
- Grandpa, l don't want to go home.
lfwe go home, come with us, Grandpa.
l'll look after you.
Who, me?
But little princess,
if l leave them, they'll be so upset.
Buse, dear, lf you take the major away
we'll be devastated here.
Now listen to your mum
and go on home.
But first give me
my good luck kisses.
Sweetie..
Goodbye, Grandpa.
Bye, teacher. Bye everyone.
Good night, Dad. Goodbye.
Thanks for everything.
lt's ourwedding tomorrow night.
We'd be so glad if you could come.
- Thanks. We'll do our best.
- Hope to see you then.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Sleep well.
Thanks.
Finally you've said something!
And it's only yourfirst day.
Bravo!
Ayþe! Come on now.
lt's time for bed.
Good night.
Soldier!
Thank goodness my arms still work.
Good night, sir.
- Soldier!
- Yes, sir!
Good night to you too.
lt's you who's really in command.
We had two new friends join us today.
Little Buse visited her grandfather.
Buse...
She makes up for all the love we'd get
from our children and grandchildren.
You know what?
Life became meaningless
after my daughter died.
But l had to get on with it, of course.
To do something.
Then l realised how many people
around me l could help.
And l tried all l could
to reach out to them.
Actually...
lt's them that kept me alive.
Ayþe thought the man l found
this morning was her husband.
DearAyþe...
Poorthing!
lt's so nice to talk to you.
No one believes me.
But that's fine.
They probably think l'm craZy.
But my husband said it straight out.
He said l was craZy.
He said l was craZy.
And then he pushed off.
lt's good he did!
Dad, are you OK?
l'm fine, son.
lf you're OK,
that's all that matters, Dad.
Me and my brother
are waiting here for you.
Dad, if you need anything
we can get it for you.
No, son.
Get some sleep, Dad.
Good night.
- Hey, Sabri..
- Aha?
Are you saying our doctors here
have got the plague?
ls that why you sent Ahmet
to lstanbul?
The doctors in Diyarbakýr
said Ahmet was fit as a fiddle.
But you know,
ourAli's a bit picky, right?
He insisted on taking his Dad
to lstanbul.
lt's his father. What could l say?
l told him to go ahead.
Look, Uncle. Don't worry.
Dad's fine.
Ali took him to lstanbul
for a bit of a change.
- lt's a trip to the city, that's all.
- They'll be back soon enough.
- What's going on? Everything OK?
- lt's fine, Abi.
What are you doing here
at this time?
Ourfather's here.
We're waiting for him, Abi.
You mean, you'll be here
as long as yourfather is?
Yes, Abi.
God, really?
l've never seen anything like it.
Normally people leave their parents here
and neverwant to see them again.
- They don't want to see them?
- No, exactly.
That's awful, Abi. Where we come from
it would be totally shameful, you know.
People should respect their parents.
lsn't that right?
True.
Come on.
l'll get you some tea.
l'm OK, Abi. But thanks.
Maybe l'll go.
l wouldn't mind a tea, Ali.
Go on, Reþat. Off you go then.
You stink!
Stop whining!
Honey, why did you lie to me?
- Come on! Why did you do it?
- Dad...
You have no right to do this!
Do you have the right
to make my daughter lie to me?
Dad, l just wanted to see Grandpa.
lt's me who lied.
Please don't get angry with Mum.
Honey.. You must never lie to me.
Do you understand?
Whatever you do,
you must never lie to me.
l didn't want you to get upset.
Even if you know l'll get upset,
you must never lie to me.
- OK?
- OK.
Selim, have you finished?
Come with me, Buse.
l need to talk to you.
l want Grandpa!
You make Mum cry.
You make Grandpa cry.
And you make me cry!
l don't love you one bit!
Buse, come back right now
and say sorry to yourfather!
Right now, l said!
Why are you angry with her?
lsn't this what you wanted?
Be proud of your daughter.
Stop grumbling.
Shut up!
Stop whining!
You stink!
Abi, what kind of a place is lstanbul?
The most beautiful place in the world.
l wouldn't live here
if you paid me millions.
You spend your life
in the traffic here.
Friends back in the village said
l'd see stars everywhere here.
But l haven't seen a single one.
You don't get politicians or big stars
coming here that often.
And when they do come
it's neverwithout the cameras.
They pose and look cute on TV
with the old people here.
But it's all just show.
- You called this a nursing home, right?
- Yes. Why?
No reason.
But let me tell you something.
There's no nursing.
Come on, Reþat. Let's go.
Abi, thanks.
My Ahmet isn't well. l know.
Wherever he goes, it won't help.
He's fine, honestly.
Ali's taken him to see doctors.
- They said he was OK in lstanbul too.
- How long have they been there?
lf he really is OK,
why don't they come back?
You're hiding something from me.
l know it.
But Ali would have told me
if something was wrong.
We're not hiding anything, l swear.
Mala Ahmet is fit as a fiddle.
Boys, why are you sleeping here
on the benches?
Oh my goodness!
Abla, we're waiting for someone.
Who?
Ourfather.
His name's Mala Ahmet.
l saw you tonight
having dinnerwith him, Abla.
But wasn't it you
who left him here?
No, Abla.
Who could ever leave theirfather?
He's our life and soul, Abla.
He's everything to us.
Without him, we're nothing, Abla.
So there are still sons like you around
in this day and age.
Not many people come here.
But here you are sleeping on the bench
waiting for yourfather.
You're an angel. You...
You're an angel of a boy.
Have you ever seen an angel?
No, never, Abla.
But l've seen plenty of 'keleks'.
We use keleks on the Euphrates
to collect wood in winter.
A kelek is... How can l explain, Abla?
lt's like a kind of raft. Yes, a raft.
lf you believe in them,
you might see an angel one day.
Abla..
With so many hadjis, hodjas,
priests and dervishes around...
...why would an angel
want to show itselfto me?
There's no discrimination like that
where the angels are.
As far as angels are concerned,
there are just good people.
And there are bad people too.
l see, Abla.
- Shall l tell you a secret, son?
- Yes, go on.
There's an angel l see,
that l talk to every day.
- Good night, son.
- You too, Abla.
Reþat!
Dad's fetched up
with a bunch of craZies.
Let's get him out of here
first thing in the morning. OK?
OK, Ali.
Oh God! Where's my gun?
You haven't come back.
Neither has my Ahmet.
Ahmet Bey's boys..
What's up, boys?
What are the preparations for?
We're going back home in a bit.
Won't you stay for Nebahat
and Yaþar Hodja's wedding?
We'd be thrilled if you did stay.
Do stay... Go on.
All right.
Friends..
As you all know,
we're going out shopping today.
Melek Haným,
this is for ourfriends.
Thank you.
Melek Haným..
Melek Haným..
This is from ilhan and me.
This is from me.
Abla, we can't accept this ring.
lt's the only memento
you have left of Nuri.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
We'll have everything ready by tonight.
That includes the wedding dress.
Melek adores everything white.
lf only we could have
a properwedding party.
Hold your horses, Yorgo Bey.
Anything could happen
between now and this evening.
Abla..
l'd like to come shopping too
if it's OK with you.
- Can we go together?
- Of course. That'll be so nice.
ln that case, let's get going.
- Are you all right, darling?
- l'm fine, Mum. Really good.
Mum..
l've found a job.
Good for you, son!
Well done!
Work hard so you can set up home.
So you can have a family.
l'm very happy here.
Very.
l think about you
all the time, Mum.
l'll take you out of here very soon,
l promise.
Goodbye for now.
Goodbye, son...
Goodbye.
Hýdýr!
Hýdýr, take these, will you?
Make yourself busy in the hall.
Let me have a quick rest.
OK, Melek Haným.
Reþat!
Give us a hand, will you?
And let's get the hall decorated.
Aren't you dead yet, damn you?
l'm sick of cleaning up your shit!
Help!
Why were you beating
this helpless old woman?
Don't you ever beat her again!
Please stop! Please!
- Stop it or you'll kill her!
- Ali!
Kader Haným,
go to my office at once!
Abi..
ls this place good or bad?
ls this place just one big lie?
Abi, are people given love here
or do theyjust get beaten?
HýdýrAbi, please tell me!
What kind of a place is this?
Ali, my friend..
People wait to die here.
lt's the last stop forthem.
Here, you find out
the true meaning of cruelty.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Abi, in that case why do people
call this place a nursing home?
That's Ayþe's wishing tree.
lt's so her husband comes back.
But he has come back!
Ayþe, you're mixing your husband up
with somebody else. But it's not him.
lf it were, the boys would recognise you.
Haven't you seen them?
He's come back!
Tell me about your son.
What's he like?
Musa...
He's found a job.
Stick it in there.
Stick it all in.
Come on! All of it!
Hurry up! Faster!
Give it here!
The brute was going to kill me!
l want to press charges!
You're right.
Violence is never excusable.
He almost strangled me.
l spend all day
cleaning up their mess.
l know very well what you do all day.
l watch your every move!
Kader Haným..
lt's the duty ofthis establishment
to help people alone and in need...
...and to love and protect them
as ifthey were our own parents.
Bullying them, hitting and humiliating
them is not part of ourjob!
This is my last warning.
lf l ever come across anything like this
ever again, not even the angels...
...will be able to save you!
Now get out of my office!
Get out!
Come in, son.
Look, son...
Violence doesn't solve anything.
All it does is make you cold-hearted.
But people should have warm hearts,
shouldn't they?
l mean, getting angry
and resorting to violence...
They're not the answer.
- Are you off afterthe wedding?
- Yes, Abi.
All right. You can go now.
- Goodbye, Abi.
- Thanks forwhat you did.
Excuse me, Abi?
Oh, nothing.
l was just talking to myself.
An lstanbul jewellerwas the scene
of an armed robbery this afternoon.
The armed suspect was shot dead
as he tried to escape with the loot.
You'll now see some CCTV images ofthe raid
that the police have since released.
At 14.00, the robber, in his mid-20s,
walked into the Üsküdar store...
Perihan, you look so beautiful
when your hair's combed!
As the robberwas about to leave
the store with the loot...
...he was shot
by the jeweller's assistant.
The robber, who died instantly,
has yet to be identified.
The jeweller's assistant
has been taken into police custody.
The weapon used in the robbery
stood out for its lavish gold plating.
The police are currently trying
to ascertain the robber's identity.
You see how beautiful you look?
Ali dear, all that's left to do
is the make-up. Then we'll be out.
- How are you, my love?
- l'm OK, Dad.
Dad, l went to the estate agent today.
Hopefully we'll find a place soon.
Then l can bring you to our new home.
Your new home?
- Are you serious?
- Aha.
How's that going to work?
Selim?
That's over, Dad.
Don't you see?
Buse would stay here if l let her.
She cries secretly at night.
So she cries secretly at night, huh?
Yes.
Well, what will she do
if she's separated from herfather?
l don't know.
She'll still see him.
- Hey, Yorgo Efendi!
- Yes?
How about we get you married?
But you'd need a double celebration.
Why's that?
Well, don't forget your circumcision,
Yorgo Efendi!
Oh, come off it!
With the vowS you've just made
before our honoured guests and witnesses...
...you are now
officiallyjoined in marriage.
So as Mayor of Taþdelen,
l now declare you husband and wife.
Congratulations!
Dearfriends!
l have a surprise for you tonight!
Please welcome an incomparable artist,
a unique performer and a real princess...
...who has been kind enough
to come all the way here tonight...
Emel Sayýn!
Ladies and gentlemen, l'm very happy
to be here with you tonight...
...but also to be reunited with
a dearfriend l haven't seen for years.
A friend who was once my mentor
and wrote me the most beautiful songs.
So Murat Hodja, l wonder iftonight
you'd accompany me on yourviolin?
Dearfriends..
You've given us
the best evening of our lives.
We're endlessly grateful
to Ahmet Bey and to you all.
Thank you, all of you.
lt may be late in the day...
...but forthe first time in my life
l've worn a wedding dress thanks to you.
lf only we'd been able
to send you away on honeymoon..
What's a honeymoon?
Abla, what's a honeymoon?
A honeymoon?
A honeymoon, son...
You know, it's a honeymoon.
l see, Abla.
Dad..
Honeymoon's the name of a holy month.
Something like Ramadan.
Honey-moon..
No, no. lt's not like that.
A honeymoon is the time
a newly married couple spend together.
But not at home. Outside the home.
Somewhere else.
lt's like a holiday.
A holiday!
So let's take them to ourvillage, Abla.
Ourvillage is fantastic.
My sons and l have been your guests.
So, please...
Come and be our guests of honour.
Dad says you're all his guests of honour.
So let's do the honeymoon together.
We can go all together.
- You can count us in!
- Me too.
l've already been there actually.
As a nurse, for my service in the east.
As l was leaving, l promised myself
that one day l'd return.
One day, for sure.
So that dream is now coming true.
l've seen nothing ofAnatolia.
l'm coming too.
Let me talk to Buse and my daughter.
lf l get the OK, then l'll come.
- Whereverthe major goes, l go too.
- Me too.
Me too.
- When are we leaving?
- Tomorrow morning. All together.
Tomorrow morning?
Well in that case, come on!
Let's give you a send-off.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Sleep well.
Abla, aren't you sleepy?
l will be in a while.
Are you leaving?
We must go to the hotel
and get ourthings.
Then there's a minibus to arrange
forthe journey.
Have a safe trip then.
But get some rest first.
Good night, Abla.
SuZan Abla...
- Can l ask you something?
- Of course, son.
The people living here...
Why do their children leave them here?
Son... Dear boy...
Mothers and fathers manage to squeeZe
doZens of children and grandchildren...
...into theirtiny hearts
and homes...
...but their children can't seem to
make room fortheir elderly parents...
...not even in a corner
oftheir huge apartments and villas.
My son Musa is very like you.
He has a good heart. A very good heart.
Chief..
l saw you when l was 10 years old.
But it's good
you're not alive today.
The great legacy you left behind
is being ruined...
...by a bunch of
despicable self-seeking cowards.
l'm just warning you.
lt was a wonderful night tonight.
Very special.
l danced with Yorgo.
l was so excited! So was he.
Because he trod on my toe and it hurt.
But l told him it didn't hurt.
Not a bit.
lt's strange..
When l'm with him, everything seems
to have a charm all of its own.
We haven't confided in one another yet.
But he's always in my heart
and on my mind.
That's what happiness is,
l suppose.
l have a favourto ask you.
The day you take me away
l'd like everything to be white.
Pure white! l'd like it to snow
and everything to be pure white.
Everyone's afraid of you.
And yet you're a holy guardian.
Perihan.. Perihan dear..
We're leaving now.
But it's only a short trip.
We'll be back in a week.
No one's going to treat you badly
ever again.
You'll be very well looked after.
Don't worry about us now, will you?
That's nice, Vahit Bey.
They've come to see you off.
No, no, Melek Haným.
They've come to pick me up.
l don't understand.
l'm leaving.
You're not coming with us, sir?
l can't, soldier.
My son's come to fetch me.
Today l'll be reunited with
my granddaughter. l'm so happy!
But on the other hand,
l'm sad to be leaving all of you.
Still, l'm very glad to have met you.
l love you all so much.
- Soldier!
- Yes, sir!
The company's now in your hands.
Soldier!
l'm Cemal Kara, a Korea veteran..
...ofthe First Turkish Brigade,
First Division, First Company.
l was born in 1922 in Kayseri.
- ln 1950, l left with the Turkish...
- Enough, soldier! Enough.
Thanks, sir.
l love you very much, sir.
l love you too, soldier.
Son..
Take good care of Perihan.
Don't you worry, Melek Haným.
What's up, GaZi Cemal?
You need to take a leak?
Yes.
Ali Bey, can you stop somewhere?
GaZi Cemal needs to take a leak.
OK, Abi.
Come on, GaZi Cemal!
Are you fighting a war in there?
l can't interrupt manoeuvres!
Not even in the Korean War
did you get gunfire like that.
What kind of automatic
have you got, GaZi?
Get a move on, GaZi! l'm bursting!
l'll wet myself in a minute.
GaZi Cemal, dearfriend..
Please hurry! Hey, come on!
What's going on? What's the big deal?
You think it's an easyjob in there?
First you have to undo the button
then unZip the fly, take a deep breath...
Don't harass me or l'll do a concert.
Then you'll really regret it.
- Son, can you turn on the music?
- Sure, Abi.
Fatma! Fatma! Fatmaaa!
The kids are still inside!
Get them out! Help them!
Fatmaaa!
The kids are still inside!
Get them out! Help them! Fatmaa!
- Praise the Lord!
- Praise the Lord! He's spoken!
Water!
Give him some water.
ilhan Bey, they were rescued.
Calm down, ilhan Bey.
Fatmaaa!
Have some water.
Come on.
Take me to my children!
Take me to Fatma!
- Ali, let's go to the municipality.
- OK, Abi.
- Fatma Hekimoðlu.
- Fatma... Hekimoðlu.
Just a second.
- Have a good look, son.
- Just a minute.
Only ilhan Hekimoðlu was rescued
from rubble ofthe Hekimoðlu estate.
There! The poor man must have lost
his memory trapped underthe rubble.
Then l suppose the municipality put him
in the lstanbul nursing home.
- Right?
- Right.
His family was buried in the cemetery
just outside town.
- Thank you, son.
- You're welcome, Amca.
HERE LlE ANGUlSHED CRlES
AND UNLlVED LlVES...
lN MEMORY OF THE
EARTHQUAKE VlCTlMS...
God!
l've prayed to you
for as long as l can remember.
l've fasted, l've given alms,
l've been on the hadj.
l've thought good thoughts
and done good things all my life.
Forwhat?
So l could go through this now?
So you could take
everything away from me?
Are you trying to torment me?
Just forget me from now on!
Forget me!
Ali, we're here at the hotel.
But let me see ifthey have any rooms.
Ali..
Ali dear.. This place..
This place is unbelievable.
Unbelievable!
Abla, l know how you love white.
That's why l brought you here.
My dear boy..
My dear, dear boy!
- Thank you.
- lt's nothing, Abla.
- Ali, they have rooms.
- They do?
Let me check out the hotel, Abla.
See you later.
lt's great Dad met these people.
He's really happy.
l wish it could always be like this.
l should go and check up on Dad.
OK, Reþat. Off you go.
- Can l get you anything else?
- No, thank you very much.
- Thank you. Everything's perfect.
- Thank you.
Well, my dear roommate!
Dear ilhan the LaZ...
How nice it is to hear yourvoice!
l wish l'd never remembered the past.
What have l done to deserve this.
God determines everything in our lives
from birth to death.
Yourfamily and your children
have gone to heaven.
How do you know where they are?
Are you God's deputy or something?
That's sinful, ilhan! Watch your mouth!
You can't change what God has ordained.
God is knowing.
God is merciful.
You don't know where you've come from
when you're born.
So how can you know where you're going?
l've lost my faith.
Your God doesn't treat
everyone the same!
Do you know what you're saying?
You can't speak against God!
Take back yourwords at once!
So what if l do know?
So what?
You've lost control of your senses!
You've become a heathen! A heathen!
What are you doing, ilhan?
You should be ashamed of yourself!
lt's disgraceful what you did!
Don't speak to me again!
Don't speak to me, any of you!
Leave me alone!
Did you know that the sun, the moon
and all the stars have their own angels?
The angels are like their deputies.
And did you know that there are angels
in every raindrop that falls from the sky?
That's why when it rains
the raindrops nevertouch each other.
Abla, that's so beautiful.
Please don't stop there.
Actually, we're not alone here either.
Even when we are alone, we're not alone.
They're always with us.
They write down what we think and do.
Those are the scribe angels.
The scribe angels.
Go on, Abla.
Some people see angels
during their life on earth.
The Koran calls this 'temessül',
meaning the angels take material form.
But there's one angel everyone sees
at the moment of death...
The White Angel.
l... l see that angel.
Yes, Abla.
l understand.
l should be going, son.
l should go.
- Good night to you.
- Good night, Abla.
- Good night.
- ls everything OK, Melek Haným?
Where are you going?
l thought l'd go to my room
and get some rest. Good night.
Good night.
ls everything OK, Melek Haným?
You're early tonight.
Yes. l wanted to get some rest.
What's the matter?
Nothing. Nothing at all.
l just got the shivers, l suppose.
Let me get you some hot linden tea.
That'll do you good.
How lovely.
Thank you very much.
l hope you feel better soon.
- Go on now! lnto your room!
- Thank you.
Uncle...!
Uncle!
- What's going on, Ömer?
- Ali just called.
Dad's arriving tomorrow with nine guests
and a couple who got married yesterday!
Dad's right as rain again!
He told Ali
we should find him a third wife.
Thank goodness forthat.
We'll start getting things ready
first thing tomorrow, OK?
- All right. Good night then!
- Good night.
Zeyno..
l want you so badly.
Let's get the kids to bed, huh?
Come on! To bed with you! Fast!
We've an early start tomorrow! Come on!
Come in.
- Good morning, Melek Haným.
- Good morning.
- How are you today?
- Much better.
Much better.
Shall we walk in the white together?
- What do you think?
- Of course.
Thank you.
Will you join me?
l'd love to.
- Thank you.
- After you.
Ali dear, you keep eyeing me.
ls something troubling you?
ls there something
you want to tell me?
Who doesn't have troubles?
l lost my motherfive months ago.
Whenever l look at you,
l think of her.
- l'm sorry if it bothers you.
- Of course it doesn't!
Besides, l see my Musa's face
everywhere l look.
So if you see your mother in me
that makes very happy.
Think of me as another son, Abla.
lf l can ever do anything for you,
just say. And l'll gladly to it.
OK.
- Ali, let's sort out the bill.
- Come on then.
- Shall we... sit down for a bit?
- Yes, absolutely.
Yorgo Bey..
Please... Will you hold my hand?
l feel so at peace...
So utterly at peace!
You know you're very special to me,
don't you?
And you're very special to me, too.
l was taken the first time l saw you.
And every day since
l've felt a little closerto you.
But for some reason,
l've never dared to confide in you.
Melek Haným,
l want to tell you how l feel.
l'm ready.
White... Pure white!
People talk about having
a 'second spring' in life.
Well, that's what l began to feel
after meeting you.
l don't know
if you'd call me cheerful...
...but when l'm with you
l'm the happiest person in the world.
Sometimes l have the feeling
you and l are the same person.
l want to cry when you cry,
to laugh when you laugh.
The things that keep us going
through the adversities of life...
...are love and faith.
And it's love and faith
that give me the will to live.
l have a better sense ofthat
after holding your hand.
l have a photograph of you.
l look at it every night
before l go to bed.
l go to sleep with it.
Melek, are you all right?
Melek... Are you asleep?
Melek!
Wake up, Melek!
Meleek!
Meleeek!
Friends! Help! Quick!
Something's happened to Melek!
Yorgo!
Condolences to us all.
We'll be seeing each other soon
dear Melek.
Ali..
- Let's get back to lstanbul.
- No.
lt was Melek's dream
to go to the east again.
Ali, please.
Let's continue on ourway.
OK, Abi.
Everyone get down!
- What's happening?
- We're being attacked!
Who are that lot?
They've come to meet us.
Hey, get up, GaZi. lt's OK.
- This way, Dad.
- Welcome home, Dad.
Welcome home, Ahmet.
You're well, l hope.
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.
Please help yourselves.
Enjoy the spread.
Dear guests, if you don't like the food
let's get you something else.
Thank you very much.
There's more than enough
of everything.
We have no appetite.
But thanks.
- Uncle..
- Aha?
A friend of our guests
died on the way.
No! Really?
We buried hertoday.
Oh no!
Honestly, l had no idea.
My condolences.
Thank you.
God rest her soul... Amen.
So what did you get up to in lstanbul?
The boys stuck me in this machine
in lstanbul.
l went in and out four orfive times.
ln the end...
...l lost my temper.
l couldn't take it so l ran away.
But l'm all right.
l'm fine.
Thank goodness forthat.
Thank goodness.
l should check on the guests.
Good night. Sleep well.
Let me introduce you.
My uncle's wife, my other uncle's wife,
my wife, my brother Ömer's wife...
...my brotherAli's wife, my mother
and all my brothers and sisters.
- All ofthem?
- Yes, all ofthem.
ln fact, there are lots missing.
Anotherthree sisters are married...
...one brother's studying
and another's doing military service.
- All from the same mother?
- No, Abla. From two mothers.
Nine from the first. That was Sare.
She died five months ago.
That's why my father got sick.
And from our second mother...
Eleven... Yes.
l have 11 brothers and
sisters from her.
Mashallah! AmaZing!
And this is MýZgin, our other mother.
- Welcome once more.
- Thank you.
Eleven children in this day and age!
Hadn't you heard offamily planning?
Abla, my father planned us all
as a matter offact.
My father's a powerful man.
The great Mala Ahmet!
He fends for us all,
he's got us all educated.
Him and my uncle, bless them.
That's great.
So then...
Do you all live in the same house?
Well, strength comes of unity.
We live together. lt's the custom here.
Your beds are rolled out
and ready indoors.
But you can sleep outside on the roof
if you like.
No, let's stick to indoors.
We don't want to catch cold.
Well, you've had a long day.
You must be tired.
Your beds are ready
so feel free to go to bed.
But Reþat's lot and the ladies
are sleeping at our place.
Zeyno, show the guests
where they're sleeping.
- A very good night to you all.
- Yes, good night.
Will the newly-weds follow me, please?
Their place is special.
What a lovely place! Thank you so much.
You shouldn't have taken the trouble.
To do you a service
is an honourfor us.
Thanks, friend.
Yaþar.. Yaþar! What are those?
Yaþar, look overthere!
Son, what are those lights?
Well, for us
the Tigris is a sacred river.
On the wedding night
of newly married couples...
...the young gather by the Tigris
to fill melon rinds with blaZing twigs.
Then they launch the rinds
into the river and make a wish.
As the rinds sail past the newly-weds,
they fill the night with light.
And so the couple's life together
will also be filled with light. lnshallah.
l hope you sleep well. Good night.
Good night.
Talk to me.
Say something.
Why won't you speak?
Ali! Ali, what's going on?
Please tell me.
Mum..
Dad's very ill.
l know he's ill.
The doctortold me...
What did he tell you, son?
To take him home.
That he only has days left to live.
Ali?
What's happening?
My brother's OK, isn't he?
Uncle..
Dad's not OK at all.
But he was supposed to be fine.
l couldn't tell you, Uncle.
What?
l lied to you.
Uncle..
Dad's in a really bad way.
Dad has a brain tumour.
- What did you say?
- l didn't want you getting upset.
He's my brother.
He's my brother!
How could you not tell me?
How could l tell you, Uncle?
l took him to lstanbul
in the hope they could do something.
The doctors said
his condition was bad.
They said to take him away
so he could live his last days in peace.
They said ifthe tumour eases off,
he may be able to speak.
Does... Does he know?
No, he doesn't.
Who are the guests?
Dad found them.
l don't where.
They all live in the same house.
Some kind of home.
The state takes care ofthem.
Don't ever give the boy
a gun to play with again! OK?
Let him play with cars and things.
Something's bothering you.
What's up?
ls something wrong?
No, nothing.
Where are we going to sleep?
On the roof.
Come on then.
Ali! Good night.
Good night, Ömer.
Hey!
Now listen to me! Don't you dare
just pretend to be asleep!
Anyone who's not asleep
l'll push offthe roof, l swear!
Keep your eyes shut!
Don't you dare open them!
Blink!
One, two, three, blink!
Rönde! Gorgeous!
My dear guests..
Starting today, l'm going to show you
ourvillage and the area around.
- Welcome to you once again.
- Thank you.
All this land is ours.
We're all family in ourvillage.
That's great.
- ls Ahmet Bey an aga?
- No.
There were agas and all that
once upon a time...
...but nowadays you only get them
in films and TV series.
Otherwise
who gives a fuck about agas?
- What?
- l'm sorry.
My delightful guests!
Dear... Not delightful.
My dear guests..
We've put on this jousting tournament
for you and our brotherAhmet.
The finest and most famous jousters
in the region are here today for you.
Ahmet!
Why don't you
get the tournament started, huh?
You all know about my condition.
- l'll soon be gone.
- You can't say that!
There have been days
when you shaved me.
There have been days
when you cleaned me up.
But most important of all
you've never lost respect for me.
l haven't been a good fatherto you.
And l've had too many children.
Forgive me forthat.
Dad..
We wouldn't be here without you.
Really it's you who should forgive us
for not being good children.
Dad, forgive us for not being
the children you, Mala Ahmet, deserve.
You always wanted us
to become doctors, Dad.
So forgive us for letting you down,
for not working hard and studying.
MýZka..
Sabri..
Zeki..
Give me your blessing.
Why are you saying this?
You're the eldest. We look up to you.
You've taught us everything we know.
lt's you who should give us
your blessing.
Ahmet..
You're the eldest of all of us.
May God give you a long life.
Let Him take from my life
to make yours longer.
Come on now.
Get some rest.
Remember..
Have friends wherever you go.
Abla!
There's a letterfor you from Musa.
From my Musa?
Yes. They sent it on
from the nursing home.
- l'll read it to you when we're back
at the village. - OK.
Hadji..
ilhan Bey..
Life is very short.
Yesterday it was Melek.
And who knows
whose turn it'll be tomorrow.
You're people
who share the same fate.
l won't have people falling out
in my house!
Especially falling out with God!
Hadji... ilhan Bey...
Do me a favour and make peace.
Come on!
Please make peace.
God has no time for people
who aren't speaking to each other.
l haven't fallen out with ilhan, Yorgo.
l'm not angry with him either.
l'd love to have been
in your shoes.
The children, family and friends
who abandoned me to die here...
...they're all alive today.
But where are they?
Nowhere near here.
Life slaps me in the face
again and again every day, ilhan!
So your slap was nothing.
How could l be angry with you?
l forgave you long ago.
You're my friend,
my companion in fate, ilhan.
l wish l'd broken my hand
instead of hitting you.
lt's you who's always
looked after me.
You've done so much for me.
Anyway, who else
do l have besides you?
Hadji..
Forgive me.
Friends...
...from now on...
...we'll be helping out
at your home in lstanbul every year.
From now on this village
is as good as yours.
This family is yours too.
Melek was right.
The thing we've all been looking for
but never managed to find...
...we've found it here
in the hearts ofthese people.
Thank you all for everything.
Life is worth living
in spite of everything.
Thanks. Thank you.
You're wonderful people.
Abla, Musa's opened a bank account
for you.
You see?
That's Musa for you.
But l don't know the first thing
about accounts!
Why don't you read out the letter?
That's more important to me.
OK, Abla.
"Dearest Mum..."
"First of all, l hope you're well
and in good heart."
"ln case you ask,
l'm just fine."
"l've started work."
"The job's easy.
Plus it's well-paid."
"Mum, l've opened
a bank account for you."
"So from now on,
that money will go in every month."
"lf l get a pay rise, l'll send more."
"lt's hard being away from."
"l'll write again soon."
"Don't forget me in your prayers."
"With much love,
your devoted son, Musa."
Abla, please don't cry.
Look, he's got a job.
He's fit and well.
Thank goodness forthat, huh?
You were going to think of me
as a son too. Have you forgotten?
No, son. How could l forget?
Thank you, all of you.
That's being a motherfor you.
lt hurts just here.
l dreamed about my Musa.
He was on a train, waving to me.
But l'll get over it. ln time.
One day we'll be reunited inshallah.
lnshallah, Abla. lnshallah.
Now we heard there were famous actors
coming from lstanbul, so we went along.
And we asked them to help save Hasankeyf,
so to stop the ancient city being flooded.
But one ofthem said
they couldn't do anything...
...and told us to stand together
like the people in Bergama.
The most people we ever get
to play pokerwith is three!
Don't forget,
you all have a home here now.
There are 237 nursing homes in Turkey
housing some 16,188 elderly people.
A good 80 per cent ofthese homes
are located in the big cities.
ln Anatolia, on the other hand,
lack of demand has meant...
