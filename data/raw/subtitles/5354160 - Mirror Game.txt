(Sound of Azan)
It's fun, the character changes soon after dawn
He brings a car here every day,
It scares me
Moves from one character to another,
If all goes well
Don't get me wrong,
(Song)
This is a political conspiracy,
I work in a morning newspaper,
I don't want to say anything about Tanisha
You know this guy,
I'm talking about you,
What do you say brother, I am not involved in any crime
I am a low class man
What else does it do except drama,
Yes, sir works on ships, his very demand on ships
Sabbas, this is the baby tiger,
Sabbas, this is the baby tiger,
All around changes, time stops, lies come true then
All true for everyone
Where have you seen, on a ship or at sea,
You don't know much about me yet,
Why aren't you holding the phone?
Unknown number,
The biggest performance in politics
This is a prison
"What is the need to settle so many accounts"
The one you're looking for, but I'm not,
Criminals like you in this city, "there is none"
I am the mirror !! ** one **
