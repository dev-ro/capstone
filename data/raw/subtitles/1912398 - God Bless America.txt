So once we get outside
i get this guy
in a rear naked choke
and he passes out. 
- Oh, fuck, really?
- Yeah.
- That's terrible.
- No, it was awesome.
I'm Robbie barkley and you're
watching "Hollywood extreme."
Another young man comes
forward with allegations
that he was sexually molested
by Michael Jackson
while visiting
the neverland ranch.
Parents claimed to keep
the secret under wraps
because they loved
his music.
Why don't they just
leave him alone?
All Michael ever wanted to
do was make people happy.
That's all
he wanted to do. People
don't know what happened
between him and those kids.
They weren't there.
They're just a bunch
of jealo haters.
I hate people who
say bad things about
Michael Jackson.
I fucking hate haters.
I hate my neighbors.
The constant cacophony
of stupidity 
that pours from their apartment
is absolutely soul-crushing.
I looked him right
in the eye.
I go, "you're retarded"
and I punched him right
in the face.
It doesn't matter how
polite I ask them
to pctice some
common courtesy.
They're incapable
of comprehending that their
actions affect other people.
They have a complete lack of
consideration for anyone else
and an overly developed
sense of entitlement.
They have no decency,
no concern, no shame.
They do not care
that I suffer
from debilitating migraines
and insomnia.
They do not care that
i have to go to work
or that I want to kill them.
I know it's not normal
to want to kill them.
But I also know that
i am no longer normal.
I hate that baby.
I hate that baby's fat,
stupid face.
Hey, buddy.
What's wrong?
A lot.
I'm Robbie barkley and this
has been "Hollywood"--
- Take it easy, bro.
- I'm not your bro.
Oh, God.
Please don't shoot.
I have a baby.
Look at this.
Look at this. This is tragic.
Oh, God.
What is wrong with
Lindsay Lohan?
She used to have
a lot of potential.
I don't know what happened.
It's the most hilarious
ringtone ever.
Just text "p-I-g-f-a-r"--
...controversial
reverend artemus Goran
and his supporters
are back in the news,
this time protesting at
a cancer victim's funeral.
God hates fags!
God hates fags!
God hates fags!
Velocity. Velocity.
It's in your face.
Coming up on "tuff gurlz"...
Lucy, you -- skank.
Don't you -- disrespect me.
Bring it on!
Did you mother-- poop
in my food?
What? What?
You bitch!
I think she's
a traitor and should be
tried for treason.
Look, just because she lost
her son in the war
does not give her
the right to disrespect
all of our brave sons
and daughters who are serving
our country right now.
Frankly, I think her son's
better off dead
because now he doesn't
have to see the jerk
that his mother
has turned into.
Now, I know, I know,
before you all start flying
off the handle
with, "oh, Mike, how can
you be so heartless?"
Let me remind you there's
three things I love--
my mother, my country,
and the men and women
who fight the fight over there
so we don't have
to fight it here.
That's it for "Fuller talk."
You've heard the end of
the statement.
Remember to order all
your "Fuller talk" products
at the 800 number at
the bottom of the screen.
We still got plenty
of t-shirts available.
The boys were
caught after setting the
homeless man on fire
and then posting video
footage of the attack online.
- "Dumb nutz!"
- "Dumb nutz!"
"Dumb nutz!"
Oh, --.
- Dude, are you all right?
- Oh, --.
"Dumb nutz!"
We have a press that just
gives him a free pass
because he's black
so he doesn't have to work
hard like the rest of us
who play by the rules.
That is the world we live
in, ladies and gentlemen.
- What's your name?
- Steven Clark.
What are you singing
for us, Steven Clark?
Do you know
where you're going to?
Do you like the things
that life is showing you?
 Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Did you get
what you're hoping for?
When you look behind
you, there's no--
God, stop it.
I'm stopping you.
What are you hoping for?
Okay, okay, stop.
I'm hoping that you'll stop.
Stop, please.
You are kidding me, right?
You're wasting
our time, Steven.
What are you doing?
Stop bowing.
Just stop everything
and listen to me.
Do you--
do you have
a mental problem?
No.
Go get some
psychiatric help.
I'll see you in Hollywood.
- No, you won't.
- I can't answer
that question.
He also killed his wife
and mother,
bringing the total
to 16 dead and 33 wounded
all in one tragic afternoon.
A former altar boy
and eagle scout,
he climbed the university
of Texas clock tower in 1966
and, using his high-powered
rifles and marine training,
he became America's
first spree killer.
Meet Steven Clark,
the newest star from last
night's "American superstarz."
Now, if you missed the show,
you might want to plug your
ears for this one.
 Do you know
where you're going to?
What are you hoping for?
Okay, okay, stop.
I'm hoping that you'll stop.
That's my favorite part
of the show when they have
the crazies on.
I know, I feel so guilty
for laughing, but it is
so funny.
Makeup!
This is ridiculous.
- Morning.
- Yeah?
- Who is it?
- You blocked me in again.
You blocked yourself
in, bro.
Okay.
Can you move your car?
I'm running kind of late.
- Now?
- Yeah.
Tell him to park his car
away from us.
Fine.
Do you know
where the remote is?
Dude, you need to leave
yourself more room.
Right.
In fact, 40% of
adult Americans
cannot read above
a fourth grade level.
When high schoolers
were asked what living American
they would want to be,
the majority of girls
answered Kim kardashian
and the majority of boys
answered any male cast member
on "the Jersey shore."
We are listener-
supported radio.
We can only stay
on the air with--
I'm really late, ed.
How about you remember
how to park your fucking car?
Hey, if he plays this well
with one testicle,
maybe the whole team
should get cancer.
Oh, send all angry letters
and cards to the e-man here.
What? Ok, well,
i'm the bad guy, right?
I'm just saying
what you're all thinking.
This ain't your
daddy's sports show.
The mucho macho Grande
burrito mascheesmo experience!
It's extreme.
This is my most favorite part
of "American superstarz"--
when they have
the retards on.
- I know what you mean.
-  This thing
is crazy.
We're giving you
backstage passes,
and all you have to do
is touch her on the tit
and maybe box a little bit.
Jesus, how long have
you worked on this show
and you don't know how
to screen the dirty girls?
We want to see blood,
we want to see tears,
we want to see one of
you whores get knocked out.
Hit her in her
defective tit.
- Hi.
- What's up?
You called.
I was just trying to
figure out what time to
pick up Ava tomorrow.
Ava says she doesn't
want to visit you.
- Yeah, well, she'going to.
- Frank, I can't make her.
Yes, you can,
you're the adult.
Put her on the phone.
All right.
Hey, Ava, honey.
It's your dad.
I'm doing something
important.
Well, maybe you
could press pause?
But I'm almost to
the next level!
Hit pause.
Hi, daddy.
Hey, kid.
You excited to come
see me tomorrow?
- I want to stay with mommy.
- Why?
Because there's nothing
to do at your house.
What do you mean
there's nothing to do?
We do lots of stuff.
We play in the park.
We go to the zoo.
- We make art.
- Your house is boring.
Well, you're coming
to see me.
- Do you have
a present for me?
- No.
- Hey.
- Where'd she go?
She just handed
the phone back.
You know, I should
never have let you
move her out of town.
Frank, she didn't like
to come visit you even
when we lived in Syracuse.
All right,
well, Alison,
see what you can do about
changing her mind, okay?
Bye.
So we're done talking?
No, Brad--
oh, hey, listen.
Um, I'm not sure
I remembered to tell you,
but...
Brad and I
are getting married.
We, tell Brad
when he's down there
to smell my balls, all right?
Frank says hi.
Tell him hi back.
Bye, Ava.
Alison, get her
to come, okay?
It means
everything to me.
God, Frank,
i'll try, all right?
You are such a drama queen.
Drama queen, drama queen,
daddy is a drama queen.
Yeah, thanks.
- Hi, Karen.
- Hi.
Oh, here's that book
I was telling you about.
Thanks.
True, true.
But you know what
i was thinking?
If he plays that good
with only one testicle,
maybe the whole team
should get cancer.
- Oh, killed it, boss.
- I can't believe
you said that.
Oh, come on.
I'm just saying what
you're all thinking.
Oh, my God.
I feel so sad for him.
- Is he for real?
- Yes, he's for real.
He was on phat boy
this morning.
Yeah, that's
real, all right.
Real bad.
Oh, you're real bad.
I think he's good.
Not.
Oh, you got me.
I think I hurt
my back on that one.
You probably like it
secretly.
See, right there.
Oh!
What about you, Frank?
Did you see that
freak on "American
superstarz" last night?
What?
Last night, the freak
on "American superstarz."
No.
I mean, yes.
I saw that guy accidentally.
I don't watch
"American superstarz."
You don't watch it,
but you saw him?
Yeah, right.
What, are you too go
for the show?
Yeah.
I'm too good for
a karaoke contest
that makes stars out of
people with no talent.
You can't say that, dude.
Some of those kids
have real talent.
No, they don't.
They have good pitch.
They're relatively clean.
They're nonthreatening
to little girls and old ladies.
They have the ability
to stand in line
with a stadium
full of other desperate
and confused people.
But I assure you,
they are talent-free.
Yeah, well, I bet
32 million people would
disagree with you, bro.
'Cause that's how many
people called in
to vote last year
on the finale.
I wish I was
a super genius inventor
and could come up with a way
to make a telephone
into an explosive device
that was triggered
by the "American superstarz"
voting number.
Battery could explode
and leave a mark on the face
so I could know who
to avoid talking to before
they even talked.
Yeah, I could look and say,
"no, you're not gonna
be saying anything
that's gonna add
any value to my life."
Yeah, but it's funny.
I mean, you've got to
admit that.
Steven Clark,
that's funny shit, Frank.
It's not nice to laugh at
someone who's not all there.
It's the same type
of freak show distraction
that comes along
every time a mighty empire
starts collapsing.
"American superstarz"
is the new coliseum.
And I won't participate
in watching a show
where the weak are torn
apart every week for our
entertainment.
I'm done, really.
Everything is so cruel now.
I just want it all to stop.
- I feel sorry
for Jennifer aniston.
- I know, it's tragic.
And I don't care how many
foreigners she adopts,
- I do not like
Angelina jolie.
- Me either.
I mean, nobody talks
about anything anymore.
They just regurgitate
everything they see on TV
or hear on the radio
or watch on the web.
When was the last time
you had a real conversation
with someone
without somebody texting
or looking at a screen or
a monitor over your head?
You know, a conversation
about something that wasn't
celebrities, gossip,
sports or pop politics?
You know, something--
something important
or something personal.
You know what?
Taint and Jeff
were talking about
that this morning.
They were saying how
their freedom of speech
is in jeopardy.
What, you don't listen
to them either?
No, I don't.
What, are you more
of a k.T. And the snake
pit type of guy?
'Cause those guys
are pussies, Frank.
All right? And they
stole everything they
got from taint and Jeff.
I really don't like
any of them.
How can you say that, bro?
So maybe they're not
politically correct,
but it's funny, Frank.
Well, seeing as how I'm not
afraid of foreigners
or people with vaginas,
I guess I'm just not their
target audience.
You don't get it.
If you got it, you
wouldn't be so offended.
Oh, I get it
and I am offended.
Not because I got a problem
with bitter,
predictable, whiny,
millionaire disk jockeys
complaining about celebrities
or how tough their life is
while I live in an apartment
with paper-thin walls
next to a couple
of neanderthals
who instead of a baby
decided to give birth
to some kind of nocturnal
civil defense air raid siren
that goes off every fucking
night like it's pearl harbor.
I'm not offended that they act
li it's my responsibility
to protect their rights
to pick on the weak
like pack animals
or that we're supposed
to support their freedom
of speech
when they don't give
a fuck about yours or mine.
So you're against freedom
of speech now?
That's in the bill
of rights, man.
I would defend
their freedom of speech
if I thought it was
in jeopardy.
I would defend their freedom
of speech to tell uninspired,
bigoted, blow-job, gay-bashing,
racist and rape jokes
all under the guise
of being edgy.
But that's not the edge.
That's what sells.
They couldn't possibly
pander any harder
or be more commercially
mainstream
because this is
the "oh, no, you didn't
say that" generation
where a shocking comment
has more weight then the truth.
No one has
any shame anymore.
And we're supposed
to celebrate it.
I saw a woman throw
a used tampon
at another woman last night
on network television.
A network that bills itself
as today's woman's channel.
Kids beat each oth blind
and post it on YouTube.
I mean, do you remember
when eating rats
and maggots on "survivor"
was shocking?
It all seems so quaint now.
I'm sure the girls from
"2 girls 1 cup"
are gonna have their own
dating show on vh1 any day now.
I mean, why have
a civilization anymore
if we no longer
are interested in
being civilized?
Frank.
Can I see you
iny office?
Uh, yeah, sure.
Come on in.
Have a seat.
You know Ronald
from h.R.
- Yeah, yeah. Hello.
- Hi.
Frank, there's no easy
way to bring this up,
so let's just
cut to the chase.
What is your relationship
to Karen in reception?
Frank, what is your
relationship to Karen
in reception?
Oh, well, I just started
talking to her recently.
She was very nice.
We sit together at lunch.
Is something wrong?
What is she accused of?
I find it hard to believe
that she would ever do anything
to hurt the company.
I see.
Did you send Karen flowers
to her home?
Yeah, I did.
Why?
Well, she said she was
having a bad day
and I thought it would
make her feel better.
How did you get
her address?
I looked it up.
I went in her records.
You understand
that's a huge violation
of company policy, right?
Well, yeah, but I didn't
want to have them delivered
to the office.
I didn't want
to embarrass her.
Frank, I'm going to
have to let you go.
You're kidding, right?
No, Frank, I'm not kidding.
This company has a strict
no-tolerance policy
about harassment
in the workplace
and, well, Karen doesn't feel
safe with you employed here.
She's never said
anything like that to me.
Why don't I go talk
to her and then we'll--
Frank, listen to me
for a second.
Now...
I want you
to leave quietly.
Don't harass Karen
or anyone else on
the staff as you leave.
Your severance checks
will be mailed to you.
This is ridiculous.
I've been here 11 years.
I know, Frank.
I know it's ridiculous.
But it's not me.
It's the higher-ups.
Let me know if you
need a recommendation.
Would you ask her
for my book back?
He wants his book back.
Thank you, Danny.
A tumor this size
is very dangerous.
Unfortunately surgery
to remove it
can be just as dangerous
as leaving it.
I advise you
to discuss this...
With your family.
I'm sorry.
Oh, got to take this.
Yeah?
What?
I wanted the one
with the moon roof.
The-- the-- no, like
the one we test drove.
I'm going to fuck you.
I'm going to come down
to that dealership
and I'm gonna fuck you
in the ass, you understand?
I'm going to come down there,
i'm gonna rip your cock off,
i'm gonna shove it
right up--
no, you know what?
I'm gonna tear the cock off
that giant purple gorilla
and shove that up your ass.
Yes, maybe then you
should look into a moon roof.
Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you.
Do you have any family?
No, not really.
Sir.
You can't be here.
This Tuesday, forget everything
you know about bowling.
This is bowling
on steroids.
"Bowling beatdown raw."
You think
you know bowling?
Suck it.
All right, people,
make me happy.
What do you got?
Give me something.
We got this dude Steven Clark
from "American superstarz."
He is a freak, right?
Ridiculous. Very funny.
Do you like the things
that life
is showing you?
I hear he lives
with his mom.
Oh, shock, whoa.
You're wasting
our time, Steven.
What are you doing?
Stop bowing. Just stop
everything.
That guy's a freak.
Find out as much about
that weirdo as you can.
- Okay?
-  Did you get what
you're hoping for?
Hi, my name is Chloe.
I live in Virginia beach
and I rule holy cross.
I love Chloe.
She's my bestest friend ever.
I feel really blessed
to have her in my life.
Like, I don't know what
i would do without her.
She's like mbest friend.
She's so pretty,
she's so beautiful,
and she's so rich.
I love her.
This party is gonna be amazing.
Yeah! Mm!
We love you, Chloe!
We love you, Chloe!
Wow!
We love you, Chloe!
I only wear labels and since
i live in Virginia,
of course I couldn't
find a dress good enough
for my party.
So I told daddy we had
to go to Paris.
I'm all about couture.
- We could be twinsies!
- Mother, you look like a whore.
This is about me.
God, I hate you.
You ruin everything.
This is fun.
Use it in good health.
- Happy Birthday, sweetheart.
- Remember, no boys in the back.
Baby?
Say something,
honey, come on.
- The camera's on.
- I wanted an escalade.
You said--
- I wanted an escalade!
- Daddy can take it back.
Get away from me!
It's my job as a parent
to make her happy.
So I screwed up this time
because she's not happy.
That's the evidence of it.
If she's not happy,
i screwed up.
So tell us all about Chloe.
Chloe is not just
my daughter.
- She is my best friend.
- Mother!
They're asking me.
I'm very popular.
Everyone loves me
because my family's rich
and because I'm so pretty.
This is the biggest day of my
life and you're -- it up!
Are you serious?
You're so stupid!
You're not even doing anything!
I'm doing all the work!
What the -- is that, dad?
What the -- is that?
You know what? Let's do
this without them around.
- No, you can stay.
- I don't care about you.
- Hey.
- I hate mommy!
I hate mommy!
What are you talking about?
They got me a BlackBerry
and I wanted an iPhone.
Okay, okay, honey.
Let me talk to your mommy.
- Hello?
- You got her a BlackBerry?
Look, Frank,
I don't want to hear it.
I feel bad enough as it is.
I thought it's what
she really wanted.
No, I mean, why would you get
her a BlackBerry or an iPhone?
I don't need
this right now.
Did you talk to her about
me picking her up?
Ava, princess, you want
to go see your dad?
I want an iPhone!
I don't want my dad!
I hate going there!
I never want to see
him again!
I want an iPhone!
I want an iPhone!
I want an iPhone!
Frank, I've got to go.
- No, you can stay.
- I don't care about you.
- All I care
about is my party.
Turn it off.
Dad, listen to me.
This is the biggest day
of my life
and you're -- it up.
Are you serious?
You're so stupid!
You're not even doing anything.
I'm doing all the work.
What the -- is that, dad?
What the -- is that?
Dad, listen to me.
You're not listening to me.
You're just talking
to the -- cameras.
You'll get all
your gift bags.
I don't care about gift bags.
 You have forsaken
all the love you've taken
 sleeping on a razor,
there's nowhere left to fall
your body's aching
every bone is breaking
nothing seems to shake it
it just keeps
lding on 
Your soul is able
death is all you cradle
sleeping on the nails
there's nowhere
left to fall 
you have admired
every man desires
everyone is king
when there's no one
left to pawn 
 I thread
the needle through
 you beat
the devil's tattoo
 I thread
the needle through
 you beat
the devil's tattoo
 I thread
the needle through
 you beat
the devil's tattoo
 I thread
the needle through
 you beat
the devil's tattoo
 I thread
the needle through
 you beat
the devil's tattoo
 I thread
the needle through
 you beat
the devil's tattoo
 I thread
the needle through.
Hey, creepy.
Isn't this schoolgirl thing
a little played out?
God damn it!
No, I don't want that.
Mom, it's against
the law to talk on the phone
when I'm driving.
I'm going, okay?
Bye.
Don't move
and don't make a sound.
If you want the car,
just take it. My parents
got me the wrong one anyways.
- Yeah, that's
a fucking tragedy.
- What are you doing?
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
School's out for summer
school's out forever--
Oh!
Shit! Shit!
Fuck.
Fuck! Fuck!
- God damn it!
- Help!
- Chloe?
- Help!
Help!
School's out forever...
Did you just kill Chloe?
Awesome.
No more pencils
no more books
no more teachers...
Hello?
Weird drifter guy.
Look, I know
you're in there.
Hi. What are you doing?
Nothing.
Great, me, too.
I'm roxy.
What's your name?
- Frank.
- Great.
It's really excellent
to meet you, Frank.
Telle all about it.
About what?
Did the bitch cry?
Yeah.
Oh, that is fantastic.
Oh, God, I wish I could
have seen it up close.
Whoo!
Hey, hey, hey.
Somebody just made that.
Jumping Jesus Christ, Frank.
Live it up.
This is the best day ever.
Who are you killing next?
Do you take requests?
'Cause I was thinking
maybe some kardashians,
my gym coach, people
who give high fives,
really any jock,
twi-hards,
people who talk
about punk rock.
- Who else really
rips my cock off?
- Get off the bed.
Oh, mormons and other
religious assholes
who won't let gay people
be married
and adult women who call
their tits "the girls."
- Ew, like I don't even--
- stop it!
Just please,
be quiet.
Get off the bed, huh?
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.
I'm kind of busy right now.
Awesome.
You have to be
careful with that.
- Wait.
- No, don't do--
that's kind of personal.
"Dear Ava, your life will
be better without me.
I'm sorry.
Love, dad."
A suicide note?
Are you fucking
kidding me?
God, the greatest thing
to ever happen around here
and you're just
some sad-sack pussy?
God damn it.
Well, do it, then.
I want to watch.
Let's go.
How do you know
I won't kill you?
I don't.
And, frankly, Frank,
I don't fucking care.
Frank.
What?
I got an idea.
Okay, go ahead.
You're sure
you're ready now?
Yup, all systems go.
Wait, again.
Sorry. Can I say
something first?
Go ahead.
You know, it's just that
you really had the chance
to do something awesome here.
But you're blowing it, Frank.
Now you're just gonna be
remembered as some creepy
old stalker dude
who was in love with
some young twat on
a television show.
Just a pervy old dude
that killed that girl
and then himself
when he couldn't have her.
Wah.
I didn't kill her
because I couldn't have her.
I killed her
because she wasn't nice.
And that was
a fantastic start, Frank.
Your instincts
were right on.
She was a class-a cunt.
But with so many horrible
people in the world
who should be taking
the big dirt nap,
why quit now?
You kill yourself, Frank,
and you're killing
the wrong person,
which would be a shame
when there are so many other
Chloes out there
who need to die.
Like who?
Nascar fans,
country fans,
people who dress their babies
in band t-shirts.
No, no, no,
people who deserve to die.
All those people
do deserve to die.
No.
Chloe's parents.
If anybody comes,
you honk the horn.
But no matter what,
you don't get out of
the car, you got it?
Aye, aye, Captain.
I'm not kidding around.
- Frank.
- What?
This is more fun than
killing yourself, right?
I don't know.
Yeah, I guess.
Frank.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
- Get in the house
and shut the fuck up.
- Jesus.
- Get over here.
Get over here.
- Go. Go.
- Honey?
- Get over there by the couch.
- Do what he says.
- Do what he says.
- What do you want?
- We could give you money.
- Listen, I'm a very rich man.
Don't you know who we are?
We're Chloe's parents.
- We were all on TV.
- Yeah, I know exactly
who you are.
I'm the man that
killed your daughter.
- God damn it!
- Oh, God!
- Yes, we did it!
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Get off me.
I told you to stay
in the car.
Frank, she was getting away.
You mean thanks?
Yeah, let's go.
That was fucking
crazy, right?
Yeah.
I feel...
- I feel...
- Good?
Yeah.
I feel good.
It's weird.
Thanks.
Perfect.
You guys need
some extra napkins?
Look, I'm sorry.
I really thought
this would work.
All right, my turn.
Trme again.
We're definitely gonna
need some new clothes.
So where are we
going next?
What do you mean we?
There's no we.
Frank, you have to
take me with you.
No way.
Come on, please?
No. What about
your family?
My family?
Well, my mother is what you
would call a crack whore.
I live in a trailer with
her and her boyfriend,
and every night
after she passes out,
he comes into my room
and rapes me.
I don't know what to say.
- Well, let's kill them.
- Yes!
Wait, no.
No, no, we can't keep
killing people we know.
That's how people
get caught.
We have to keep it random.
That's a good idea.
See, I'm already helping.
So, please, Frank.
Can I please
come with you?
What about your friends?
I mean, don't you got any
friends you could stay with?
Frank, I have no friends.
- All right.
- Really?
- Oh, thank you.
- Hey, listen.
When I say something, it goes.
No more of this shit.
- Okay.
- No more acting on your own.
All right.
Thank you.
Washing machine's broken.
What?
What are you doing?
Seeing if there's anything
in the news about us
or the murders.
- Is there?
- Yeah.
On the murders,
nothing about us.
"Murdered family of
reality star found"--
let me see that.
- See ya.
-  Oh, my God.
I had this shirt.
It's still ugly.
What do you think?
I think that might be
a little small on the belly.
So do you
have a girlfriend?
I'm not gonna
answer that question.
- Why not?
- 'Cause you're a kid.
I don't want to have
an inappropriately mature
conversation with you.
All right?
I was only asking because
I thought you were gay.
- Well, I'm not gay.
- You seem gay.
- Really?
- Yes.
Wow.
So do you
have a girlfriend?
- No.
- A wife?
I did.
Not anymore.
Oh.
Are you attracted to me?
Don't be weird.
You don't like me
because you think I'm ugly?
I'm not attracted to you
because you're a child.
And you think I'm ugly.
I'm not gonna answer
that question.
Well, what if we were
the same age?
I'm not gonna answer
that question either.
So you can kill a teenager,
just not fuck one?
Yeah.
But you do think
I'm mature for my age?
Not particularly.
You're seriously not
interested in me at all
as a girlfriend?
What the hell
are you talking about?
I'm not a pedophile.
So we're platonic
spree killers?
Yeah.
And that's all.
Because you think I'm ugly.
It's unethical for me
to answer that question
because I refuse to
objectify a child.
I mean, that's part of
what's wrong with everything.
I'm not American apparel.
I'm not the creep that came
up with those bratz dolls.
All men like young girls.
That's what society's
trying to sell you.
But, you know, maybe
it's time for adult males
to aim a little bit
higher than raping kids.
I mean, fuck r. Kelly.
Fuck Vladimir nabokov.
And fuck Mary kay letourneau
while we're at it.
Fuck Woody Allen
and his whole
"the heart wants
what it wants" bullshit.
Apparently that
erudite genius' heart
wants the same thing
that every run-of-the-mill
pedophile wants--
a young, hairless Asian.
Nobody cares that they
damage other people.
I was just wondering
if you thought I was pretty.
I won't be responsible for
the self-esteem of a teenager.
If you don't like it,
you can cram it.
Fuck you, Frank.
- Frank?
- Hey.
Oh, I thought you left.
I thought about it.
I got you something.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I get it.
Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
Fine, you don't have
to wear it.
I just don't usually
wear hats.
My head looks
kind of weird in them.
Although that one looks
pretty good, huh?
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Yours looks good.
Patty hearst, right?
Thank you for choosing
our theater.
As a courtesy to
your fellow patrons,
please refrain
from talking
and please turn off
your cell phones.
And now enjoy our
feature presentation.
War is an atrocity.
I mean, it takes
young kids,
good kids
for the most part...
Shit.
Hey, bitch.
Oh, not doing nothing.
I'm in a movie.
Shh.
I'm in a movie.
I'm in a movie.
Oh, okay, look.
- Shh.
- Okay, mom.
Oh, shh.
Hello?
We're in the middle.
We're in the middle.
Hey, did this really happen?
Munchies.
Thank you.
...several guys stuck,
raping their mothers.
I'm rry.
Sit down.
Because the villagers were
supporting these bastards.
Hey, hey.
No, I can't get--
I'm at work.
I can't.
You're gonna have to
pick her up today.
I can't get there.
I'm working.
Yeah.
What can I tell you?
I'm swamped.
What are you
looking at, old man?
Frank, don't.
Take your hat off.
Let me.
Oh!
God damn it.
Give me that.
You fall in love...
 Bing boom
the sky up above,
zing boom 
is caving in...
( Grunts I'm recording this.
Shh, shh
it's oh, so quiet
shh, shh...
Thanks for not talking
during the feature.
Thanks for turning
off your cell phone.
You're welcome.
Shh
shh.
Here, you can use
this thing as a pillow.
Oh, thanks.
Good night, Frank.
Good night.
You folks shouldn't
be sleeping out here.
Can I see your license
and registration?
Of course, officer.
My dad keeps
everything in here.
I'm her Uncle.
This is my
brother-in-law's car.
I'm taking her down
to see some colleges.
Go, big blue!
Do you have any I.D.?
Yes, I do, sir.
All right,
I'll be right there.
No more sleeping
on the side of the road.
Do you still need
to see my I.D.?
No, that's fine, hon.
You just stay safe.
Lot of crazy
people out there.
Tell me about it.
Thank you, officer.
What the hell
is that about?
At least I don't
steal cars.
What makes you think
it's stolen?
All right,
I stole it.
But from a jerk.
What is this?
Don't get too attached.
Now you go.
All right, I'm a little
bit bigger than you.
You don't got to
dirty Harry it.
Wrap your other hand
around here.
Feel a little
stability there?
All right,
now do it.
Pretty good.
Just concentrate
on that far site.
You're aiming at
the bear, right?
Don't anticipate
the recoil.
Just squeeze it
and let it go.
That's all bear there.
I think Elvis
would be proud.
- Pretty good.
- Thanks.
3:00.
6:00.
12:00.
9:00.
6:00.
Nice.
6:00.
- Yay!
- Yay.
- Good.
- Yeah.
Ooh.
- Migraine?
- Yeah.
Well, we could
stop shooting.
Yeah, thanks.
You did a good job.
I have a good coach.
That and I was pretending
the targets were the
cast of "glee."
What's wrong with "glee"?
It stereotypes
and homogenizes
homosexuals.
Plus it ruined
"rocky horror" forever.
That's true.
You want my money?
I'll pay for all your
health care.
Tea party members
continued to taunt
the Parkinson's sufferer
after he was shoved
to the ground.
Parkinson's is what God
gives socialists.
Parkinson's is what
God gives socialists.
I am so depressed.
I mean, I can't believe
there's nothing on about us.
That's one of the problems
of your generation.
You can't enjoy anything
unless it was recorded.
You were there.
You lived it.
Isn't that enough
of an experience?
I mean, next time you want
to remember something,
instead of taking out
your cell phone,
why don't you take a picture
of it with your brain camera?
I mean, when I was your age,
nobody tweeted, yet we
managed to have experiences.
You know, a phone was attached
to a wall back at the house.
It didn't have a camera.
What are you,
Jeff foxworthy?
And a cell phone was
the phone you called
your pappy on to get
you out of jail.
A-do-do-do-do-do.
Some people are blaming
the movie itself
for the murders.
Is this violent
documentary too violent?
- Do you believe that?
- I know, we made the news.
No, what they're saying.
Nobody can take
personal responsibility
for anything anymore.
But that's not what
the lone survivor believes.
- What's the point?
- Everybody was talking,
goofing around,
making noise.
I believe they did this because
we were all being so rude.
How about that?
Unbelievable.
The truth, and on this channel.
The suspects are a Caucasian
male in his mid to late 50s...
- Late 50s?
T- and a young woman in hern
ma  early to mid 20s.Te 50s...
Also Caucasian.
They are considered armed
and very dangerous.
See? They think
I'mature for my age.
- Mm-hmm.
- We're famous!
Hey, high five.
Come on, don't leave
me hanging, rocko.
No, I don't high five.
Mental high five?
Yeah.
Mental high five.
Steven Clark, he wasn't
the winner on "American
superstarz,"
but I think he's a winner.
He's back th a new
hit single.
We want to hear what you think.
Give us a tweet.
Do you know
where you're going to?
Do you like the things...
There they go,
making fun of the guy
who rides the short bus.
Yay, America.
Do you know?
- Ready?
- Your turn.
Okay.
Just think about
blowing your head off.
Come on.
Okay.
Ready?
Completely random.
It could happen
at any time.
- Ready? Am I going?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- You're going.
All right, that's good.
- Okay.
- You know what I hate?
What?
I hate guys that say
actually all the time.
Like, "you actually
got a gun to your head."
Oh, that's a good one.
You're actually-- oh!
You're actually still alive.
You know what else
I hate?
People who misuse
the term literally.
Literal people, I gues
- okay.
- Ooh.
- We're getting close.
- Uh-huh.
I hate guys
that buy $100,000 cars
and then drive around
10 Miles slower than
the speed limit.
Mau!
I hate guys
who wear lady pants.
- Lady pants?
- Oh.
- Whoa.
- Okay.
I'm no mathematician,
but my odds are not good.
Well, Pythagoras,
maybe it's time to die.
How'd that feel?
It felt good.
It's a good night to die.
Velocity energy drink,
it's in your face.
Frank, let me sleep
in the chair.
No, I'm all right.
Come on, sleep in the bed.
You're the one with the
fucked-up headaches.
No, no, this is good.
Behold, the walls
of Jericho.
No, I'm fine.
Jesus, Frank, get in bed
or I'm sleeping on the floor.
I'm sleeping on the floor.
Here I go.
Do you see this?
I'm going down.
Ah, Frank, it smells.
I wouldn't trust
that floor.
Come on, Frank.
What are we gonna
do now?
Well,
what's our
prime directive?
I didn't have you pegged
as a "star trek" fan.
What's that
supposed to mean?
I don't know.
I figured you more for
the new
"Battlestar Galactica."
Maybe some graphic novels.
Bands like fall out boy
and the green days.
Oh, fuck you, Frank.
I happen to like classic
and next gen "star trek"
and I'm actually able
to read a book without
pictures, thank you.
And I prefer the classics.
I'm not ashamed to admit
to the occasional Anne rice
or "Harry Potter."
Fall out boy and green day
suck shit
through 10 bricks.
Musically I'm all about
Alice Cooper.
I like Alice Cooper.
You don't like
Alice Cooper, Frank.
That's like a Muslim saying
that he likes Mohammed.
You accept Alice Cooper.
You accept that Alice
came down
and gave us rock
that upset authority figures
and made the outcasts
not feel so all alone.
You accept that
there would be no goth
movement without Alice.
No Trent reznor,
noarilyn manson,
not even shitty
soft cock rockers
like poison
or bon jovi
because not only did he
introduce macabre theatrics
into rock, he also invented
the power ballad
with a little song called
"only women bleed."
Okay, I get it.
I promise I won't kill
Alice Cooper.
Hey, don't even joke
about it, Frank.
Do you realize
that he was the first
rock star to wear makeup?
And he was wearing dresses
long before bowie stole
his first pair of culottes
from his mother's
clothesline.
And he was screaming about
death and frustration
way before punks.
So I guess
you have to accept
that Alice Cooper
invented that, too.
Are you a.D.D., juno?
Yes, I have a.D.D.
And don't you ever call me
fucking juno again.
Sorry.
That's who we
should kill next.
A fictitious character?
No, diablo Cody.
Fuck her for writing
that movie.
She's the only stripper
who suffers from too much
self-esteem.
I don't want to kill
people just because you don't
like their movies.
Why not?
She's encouraging
teen pregnancy.
Her storylines
and characters are for shit.
And she's just so
excited to throw
any funny line she's heard
into the scene
that she makes girls my age
look like cutesy assholes
from a dirty Dr. Seuss book.
"Horton hears
a star-bellied
queef, blah."
I only want to kill
people
who deserve to die.
You know who we should kill?
Who?
People who use rock star
as an adjective.
As in rock-star parking.
Or people that pound
energy drinks all day.
People who use
the term edgy,
in your face, or extreme.
Oh, no, no, wait.
That would rule out a lot of
the chalupas thai love.
Anyone who wears crystals
or calls themselves
spiritual.
Or people who say namaste.
What's that?
It's an Indian greeting
the hippies stole.
Oh, hippies.
Anyone who buys
an anarchy t-shirt.
Or people who use
e term the man
in a positive
or negative light.
As in, "the man is always
sticking it to us"
or "you're the man."
- Anyone who's
ever been pumped.
- Or stoked.
Anyone who gives and
receives physical high fives.
Agreed.
No, no, no, I'm not
going to let you play
the freedom of speech
here on my show, okay?
Okay?
Leme explain
something to you.
I would much rather
lose my rights to
freedom of speech
than ever have
the aclu defend my right
to freedom of speech.
And another thing,
you pinhead.
The aclu--
take heed, America--
I think is more dangerous
to the United States
than Al-qaeda.
I'll give you a chance
to respond
if you have anything
articulate to say
right after this.
Anyone who makes a living
spreading fear
to the masses.
Or is just plain mean.
Mmm.
So our prime directive
is to interfere
with the cultural evolution
of a pre-warp civilization.
I've got to go to sleep.
My head is killing me.
Stop it.
What? I was trying
to help your headache.
It's a pressure point.
I wasn't being sensual.
Yeah, and people who
use the term sensual.
- Gross.
- You said it.
- Hey, Frank.
- Mm-hmm.
Thanks for letting me
come along with you.
Good night, juno.
Fuck you, Frank.
Oh
hurray
let the show begin
i've been ready
come on
hurray
let the lights grow dim
i've been ready
ready as this audience
 that's come
in here to dream
loving every second
every moment,
every scream 
 have been
waiting so long
to sing my song
and I
have been waiting
so long 
for this thing to come
and I
have been thinking
so long 
i was the only one
God, that feels
so strong
i've been so strong
i'm so strong
feel so strong
 I feel
so strong
 so-- 
We gonna do this
or what?
- What do you think?
- It's good.
- It's good.
- Jesus, Frank.
You look like fuck pie.
There he is.
Ladies.
I got to get back
to working out.
I got to get back
to working
- Did we get him?
- No, I think we just
winged him.
Is he breathing?
I don't know.
You stop moving
or I shoot her.
You don't have the balls.
Really?
I don't?
Fuck you,
you condescending prick.
Why do you got to be
so rude all the time?
Is that what this
is all about?
Huh? My show?
You must really hate
my politics, huh?
Look, you kill me, you jus
turn me into a martyr.
I don't hate your politics.
In fact, I agree with you
on some things.
- You do?
- Yeah.
Then what is this about?
Why do you got to be s?
Are you really
willing to die
just because you
don't think I'm nice?
Do you have it
in you, Fuller?
How long has it been since you
actually had to shoot someone?
Oh, wait.
You never have.
I forgot.
You never served
in the military.
You had your parents
help you dodge the draft.
Just like every other
rich blowhard
who makes a living off
of American xenophobes.
Seems like you guys
just exploited
some tragedies
to further your agenda.
In fact, it seems like
it's always been
about protecting big oil
companies' right
to keep boiling
the whole world alive
just bause some
court-appointed
hillbilly president
started taking orders from
Jesus or the Easter bunny
orome other make-'em-up
play friend of his.
Please, that is just
your typical uneducated,
left wing feminazi
point of view.
Feminazi?
Again, why do you
got to be so mean?
He just wishes
everyone would act nice.
I, on the other hand, think
yo politics are shit.
Whoa, whoa, wait!
You bitch.
Yup.
Exactly what part of his
politics do you agree with?
Less gun control,
of course.
But, Frank, then every
nut will have a gun.
Wow, look at
all these people.
Yeah, I wish I had
an ak-47.
Bam.
Supporters of Michael Fuller
are calling him a hero,
believing that his homicide
is tied to the outspoken
support of the war
and possibly the work
of a terrorist sleeper cell
Fuller was right.
He's a fucking martyr.
Fucking morons.
I don't care.
I'm just glad he's dead.
Is that your ex-wife?
Yeah.
She's pretty.
Yup.
I don't care if we're late.
I hate school.
I thought that was
you, Frank.
Hi, Brad.
- New wheels?
- Yeah.
You want to come
say hi?
School sucks!
Nah.
They look kinda busy.
Oh.
Who's ur friend?
A friend.
Oh.
Well, uh, give us a call if
you decide to stay in town.
I'm sure the girls
would love to see you.
Yeah, thanks.
Hey, don't tell them
we were here, all right?
Oh, Roger that.
Would you get Ava's
backpack from the house?
Sure thing.
- I want my backpack.
- Honey, you're killing me.
So are we gonna kill him?
Not that one.
I hate that one.
I want my other one!
Just get the blue one.
Get the blue one.
No.
I want him to suffer.
Isn't it early
for beer?
This doesn't seem like
the type of place to
order the cognac.
Have you been
to a doctor?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Give me your hand.
It's not gonna work.
This some kind of
new age bull-- ah!
Shh.
I can't believe
that's actually working.
Shut up and give me
your other hand.
Gentle.
Ah!
You know what
you need, Frank?
A straw?
You need a vacation.
 Let's take
a boat to Bermuda
let's take a plane
to St. Paul 
let's take a kayak
to Quincy or nyack,
let's get away... 
You guys are all commies.
Pinko commies.
Here, take all my money.
What, are we in Russia?
Are we in Russia?
Is that what's going on here?
O need to come
back at all 
 let's take a powder...
- Run, man!
-  To Boston for chowder
-  let's get
away from it all...
 We'll travel around
from town to town
we'll visit everytate
 and I'll repeat,
i love you, sweet 
in all the 48
 let's go again
to niagara... 
You really got to take
both those spots?
Yeah. Fuck you.
No, fuck you.
 Let's get out
of our hut, dear
 get out of
our rut, dear
 let's get away
from it all... 
Let's motor down
to Miami 
 let's climb
the grand canyon wall
let's catch a tuna
way out in laguna
 let's get away
from it all... 
Let's travel South
of the border 
 buy me a real
Spanish shawl 
 let's eat tamales
in downtown Nogales
let's get away
from it all 
we'll charter boats
and airplanes, too 
 to far-off
spots unknown...
- Get back in. Get back in.
-  Then hurry there... 
 To find somewhere
where we can be alone
 let's spend
the weekend in Dixie...
It's beautiful.
Yeah, it's God's country.
 Then off to Reno,
but just to play keno
-  let's get
away from it all... 
-  Let's breeze to
- Buckingham Palace
 we'll tell 'em
we dropped by to call
and be socially busy
with Philip and lizzy
let's get away
from it all...
Come on, Frank.
Let's dance.
- Oh, I don't dance.
- Come on, I'll lead.
I don't doubt that.
 All of Europe
is waiting to greet us
lots of good friends
said to call 
 then after our roaming,
good old home, sweet home
and let's get away
won't you please
take me away? 
Come on, everybody
let's get away
from it all...
Want to get away?
So do I.
Let's get away.
Thank you.
I know.
Everybody onboard.
We're getting
away, aren't we?
Thank you.
Oh, stop it.
Thank you so much.
No, it's always my pleasure.
I love doing that song.
Next I'm gonna do
a little rap song
you're gonna like.
"Fuck the police."
No, I'm kidding.
I'm not gonna do that one.
Thank you all.
Where'd you hide them
after you killed them?
I told you the truth,
sheriff.
I didn't kill them.
I've been thinking.
Let's go legit.
What do you mean?
Turn ourselves in?
No. Like, let's move
to France
or some other country
that hates Americans.
If we got caught later,
France wouldn't extradite us.
And we could have
a cute little French farm
and raise cute
little French goats
and make cute little
French cheeses
and have a bunch of
other adorable little
French animals.
It sounds nice.
Here, give me your hand.
I still can't believe
that works.
Do you know where
you're going to?
Llwe know where
Steven Clark is going to.
The "American superstarz"
performer
has been asked to perform
on the live finale of the show
after last week's failed
attempt to take his own life.
Good news.
Should kill
all those people.
They make fun of that guy
till he's ready to kill himself.
Then they exploit him
so everybody can feel better
about laughing at him
and pushing him over
the edge in the first place.
I really hate this country.
That's why we're
moving to France.
Hello?
Hey, doc.
It's Frank murdock.
You left a message?
Yes, I did, Frank.
Uh, I have some bad news.
Um, you don't have
a brain tumor.
What?
You're not gonna die.
I don't understand.
I mean, I saw the tumor.
You showed it to me.
Yes, there was a tumor
in an m.R.I.,
but that was Frank burdock
with a "b."
Not Frank murdock
with an "m."
Wait. What is
the bad news, then?
Because this cocksucker
burdock is probably
gonna sue me.
He's a real ballbuster.
You know what I mean?
But how come my head
hurts all the time, then?
I don't fucking know, Frank.
I mean, maybe you sit
too close to the computer.
Maybe you've got
high blood pressure.
Maybe you don't
exercise enough.
Maybe it's too much Viagra,
too much caffeine.
What the fuck do I know?
Hey, you're not gonna
sue me, are you?
Uh, no, no.
I wouldn't do that, doc.
Well, that's a relief, Frank.
Well, hey, thanks for
the good news, doc.
I've got to go call that
cocksucker burdock now
and tell him the bad news.
You take care, Frank.
Let's sell the car
and move to France.
Really?
I think it would be
tres magnifique.
I know a lot of French.
I know a lot of wines.
I know how to ask
where the library is.
I know how to bum
a cigarette.
I know ooh-LA-LA.
But that's about it.
I know oui.
What else could we need?
Speaking of which,
I have to wee.
Oh, snap.
Hey, buddy.
What's up with the girl?
- Pardon?
- I know she's not
your daughter.
I can tell by the way
she makes you smile.
She's my niece.
Yeah, I got a lot
of nieces.
How much for a day?
I think you got
the wrong idea, sir.
Yeah, you stick
to that story.
I don't think
I do.
You have a good one.
I know you're
gonna have a good day.
God bless.
Hey, don't use up all
the hot r is time.
I won't.
God, you'd better not be
this uptight in France.
You don't have to
shower in France.
We'd like to take
this chance
to thank everybody
in our community
and the media
for helping us
in our search
for Roxanne.
We pray that she's
still alive
and that she
makes it home to us.
Roxanne, we miss you.
And we love you.
Anyone with any information--
God fucking damn it!
You fuck.
Frank, is that you?
What happened?
- Your parents.
- What?
Yeah, I just saw them
on the TV.
You lied to me.
Well, would you
have taken me along
if I told you that I lived
in a normal house
with a set of
normal parents
who didn't abuse me,
but also didn't even try
and understand me?
That every day
in my normal life
felt like a million years?
And that I spent
all day every day
being told what to do
and what to think
by people who I'm a million
times smarter than,
but since it's not polite
to acknowledge that,
I just had to pretend
to listen to?
That every single morning
I just woke up
and wished that anything
not normal would happen?
Here are the keys
to that car.
Well, where am I
supposed to go?
I don't care.
Go back to your parents.
Just stay out of my life.
I don't got time for you.
You're just like
everybody else.
I don't got time
for liars.
Fuck you, Frank.
You're just a pathetic,
broken man!
Cocksucker!
I was running
 I was running
with the wolves
and I knew I was
caught
but I didn't know
what I caught
and I knew I was fast
 but I wasn't
fast enough...
And thankfully it has.
It's so exciting.
We are concerned
that the perpetrator
is still out tre,
but we couldn't be happier
at this moment.
Everything that
we've been through,
now we're reunited
as a family.
We're planning
a family vacation.
We're going to Disneyland.
I knew I was fast
i wasn't fast enough.
You Frank?
Frank, you didn't really
tell me exactly what you
were looking for
when you called,
so I brought you kind
of a gun pu-pu platter.
We got your .357 Magnum.
Nickel finish.
Six-shot.
Eight-inch barrel.
.357 so you know
it's got some punch to it.
You put this to the back
of some nigger's head,
all you're gonna see
is pink mist.
No. Maybe not.
Maybe not for you.
Old school.
Walther p38.
German, 9mm.
Made during
the second world war.
I mean, who knows how
to kill people better
than the Germans, right?
You know it's got to be good.
You're not a Jew,
Frank, are you?
I'm just asking
'cause, you know,
I brought up a German gun.
Um, okay.
Hey, maybe--
maybe you're looking
for something that's
a little bigger.
A little more firepower.
Let's see what we got
that may strike
your fancy here.
Huh?
Is that a honey or what?
Ak-47.
When you absolutely,
positively
have to waste every single
motherfucker in the room.
Accept no substitution.
I can see you like this.
Definitely.
7.62 by 39.
It's an assault rifle,
but it's still light.
And talk about reliable,
Frank, I could throw this
off the roof.
I could run this over
with my car.
I could bury it in
the dirt and dig it up
and it will still fire.
That's how reliable
that is.
Best mass-produced
combat weapon ever made.
Look at this.
That fits you. Look at this.
You're friggin' Rambo, man.
Look at that. Look.
I love it.
You know what?
You don't even have
to aim this thing.
It's a spray-and-pray
kind of weapon.
What's better
than that, right?
Now, the one thing is,
this is not a cheap weapon.
This is an assault rifle.
So we're looking around
two grand for this.
So I don't know if that's
in your budget.
But what I will do,
I got three fully loaded
30-round mags
in here that I will
throw in for that $2,000.
That's a steal for
a weapon of that quality.
Now, this something
you can afford?
Yeah. I want
the case, too.
Hey, great.
You know what?
Is there anything else
I can get you while we're
talking about the gun?
Blow? Meth?
 I will take all
that they hand me down
 and make out a smile,
though I wear a frown 
and I'm not gonna take
it all lying down 
'cause once I get started,
i go to town 
'cause I'm not like
everybody else 
no, no
 I'm not like
everybody else
 I'm not like
everybody else
 I'm not
like everybody else
 and I don't want
to live my life 
like everybody else
 and I don't want to be
destroyed by everybody else
 and I don't want to get
a job like everybody else
'cause I'm not like
everybody else 
 sing it,
what are you?
 I'm not like
everybody else...
 God, if you know
that I love you true
 and I'll do anything
that you want me to 
i'll even confess
all my sins 
like you want me to
 but there onehing
that I can't do for you
'cause I'm not like
everybody else 
what did I say?
 I'm not like
everybody else
how did I say it?
 I'm not like
everybody else
one more time
 I'm not like
everybody else
like everybody else
 and I don't want to live
my life like everybody else
and I don't want to
be destroyed 
like everybody else
and I don't want to
get a job 
like everybody else
'cause I'm not like
everybody else 
what did I say?
Like everybody else
everybody else
everybody else
everybody else
everybody else.
Live, "American
superstarz" finale.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment we've all
been waiting for.
Welcome to the stage,
my man, Steven Clark.
Do you know
where you're going to?
Do you like the things
do you know
where you're going to?
Do you like the things
that life is showing you?
Yeah.
Yeah, please.
Just go around.
Look at me.
I've killed many people.
I'll kill you, too.
The question is,
do you want to die for this
shitty television show?
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to make a living here.
I don't even watch
the show.
That's the right answer.
I'll give you five.
One, two,
three, four.
Do you know?
Yeah, do you know?
Do you know?
Know, do you know?
Do you know?
Yeah
dyou know?
Do you know?
All my ladies,
do you know?
In other news, Lindsay Lohan
maintains that she
is still sober and happy.
Yeah, right.
But she does look great
in that new jewelry, right?
Oh, and speaking of
the Hollywood wildlife,
is that sasquatch
by the marquee pool?
Oh, no, it's
Robin Williams.
Oh, God, run!
Everybody run!
Yeah, all my people
put your hands
in the air.
Now wave it like you care.
Yeah!
Do you know?
Yeah!
Do you know?
Yeah!
When I say do,
you say know.
- Do! Do!
- Know! Know!
Do you know?
Hey, man, you can't
be there.
Do you know?
Hey, are you deaf?
Do you like?
Do you know
where you're going to?
Do you like the things
that life is showing you?
Where are you
going to?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Oh, yeah, yeah!
Dancing time.
Yeah!
- Boo!
- Get off the stage.
- You ck!
- You suck!
You suck!
Boo!
 Do you know
where you're going to?
Nobody move!
Sit down!
Next time anybody moves,
I'm bringing
the roof down.
Can I go?
No, stay here, Steven.
Get up.
- I said get up.
- You're kidding me, right?
You two, get up here.
Oh, sir, please.
Please.
You don't want to
do this.
How do you know
what I want to do?
Just take it easy.
Yeah, come on.
Both of you get up here.
Freeze, officer.
I'll put a bullet
right in her head.
So you think
Steven's funny, huh?
I saw you laughing,
so I'm gonna ask you again,
you think he's funny?
Yes.
Why don't you dance?
Come on, play the song.
Come on, dance.
I said dance,
come on.
And sing.
Sing it.
Do you know...
You, too.
You used to sing.
Showing you
where are you
going to?
And you all boo
and laugh like you were.
Come on, louder than that.
Frank!
9:00!
What the hell was that?
Try anything stupid again
and I swear I will
bring the roof in.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry I lied
to you, Frank.
What do you want?
I want you to put
your guns down.
You know
we can't do that.
I'm gonna keep
shooting judges
until you do.
That wasn't a policeman
that came up behind you.
That was a security guard
acting on his own.
So just calm down.
Would you tell me who you are?
Who I am?
Sure.
Is that thing on?
My name is Frank.
But that's not important.
The importt question is,
who are you?
America...
Has become a cruel
and vicious place.
We reward the shallowest,
the dumbest,
the meanest,
and the loudest.
We no longer have any
common sense of decency.
No sense of shame.
There's no right and wrong.
The worst qualities
in people
are looked up to
and celebrated.
Lying and spreading fear
are fine
as long as you make
money doing it.
We've become a nation
of slogan-saying,
bile-spewing
hate mongers.
We've lost our kindness.
We've lost our soul.
What have we become
when we take the weakest
in our society
and we hold them up
to be ridiculed
and laughed at for our
sport and entertainment?
Laughed at to the point
where they would literally
rather kill themselves
then live with us anymore?
- Frank?
- Yes, Steven?
I didn't try to kill myself
because people
were making fun of me.
I tried to kill
myself because
they weren't gonna
put me on TV anymore.
You are a pretty girl.
Thank you, Frank.
If there's a tear
on my face 
it makes me shiver
to the bone 
it shakes me, babe
it's just a heartache
 got caugh
in my eye 
and you know
i never cry
i never cry
sometimes I drink
more than I need 
 until the TV's
dead and gone 
i may be lonely
but I'm never alone
and the night
may pass me by
but I'll never cry
take away
take away my eyes
setimes I'd rather
be blind 
break a heart
break a heart of stone
open it up
 but don't you
leave it alone
 'cause that's all
i got to give you 
believe me, babe
it ain't been used
my heart's a virgin
it ain't never been tried
nd you know
i'll never cry
and you know
i'll never cry
 well, you know,
you know, you know
 you know that
i'll never cry
i'll never cry
break a heart
break a heart of stone
open it up
but don't you leave
it alone 
'cause that's all I got
to give to you
believe me, babe
it ain't been used
my heart's a virgin
it ain't never been tried
and you know
i'll never cry
i'll never cry.
