How, when and in which life we
met to someone
We don't know about that
And then how do we meet them again
in which life.
Who are you?
Amazing!
Where did you come from?
How come you are here?
From the platform
What were you doing in bathroom?
Oh!
You are travelling ticket less...
Shut up!
How did you enter in this compartment?
All seats are reserved here
Please make some space
This entire compartment has been
reserved for me
You may leave now
It's impossible
Now I will leave in bombay
What you have done that you are
hiding from everyone
You have booked all the seats
You came here intentionally
You don't know me
Do you know who am I?
Govind!

You are creating scene
You are a filmstar
Am I right?

You are going to bombay to
try your luck

Me and my friend eloped from
the house
I wanted to become an actress
One day Raj Khosla saw me
outside the studio and...
And now you are super star

Even the train is also stopped
People always follow your orders...
Look at this!

Somebody is talking to you and you

You won't see it!
Aunty was asking about you
Really!
She was saying that who is
that handsome guy?
What he does?
All girls in yourfamily is like this?
She was not asking about her self
She was asking for me
And it's not a surprising thing
I am not a girl of 1960
I will take my own decisions.
And you are taking decisions for me
I will decide it first
Have you gotjob?
I remember everything
ljust don't remember that why did
I eloped from the house
So basically
Those things make us feel like suitcase
those things are actually a lunch box
True!
Thankyou!
For what?
I will never forget this birthday
I should leave now
My train will come in 15 minutes
What's your name?
When will the next train come?
I have to go...
I am sorry I shouldn't fight with you
on your birthday
Anyways!
Where you have been?
With who?
You don't know them
I know your all friends...
Because you don't have time
One day when he wants to happy
Who does like this?
We got one fight and you can spend
a night with any girl
She is not an ordinary girl
We didn't fight
So you found someone else
in 2 hours
I didn't found someone
It happened!
What do you mean it happened?
Don't call her a slut you don't
even know her
I am not calling her slut but you
I thought we shouldn't fight on
your birthday and you...
Who can spend her night with this slut
after the first meeting
but that's okay because we broke up
And how come last night you didn't
want to study
You didn't have to go to your work
You had all your time for
that Radha
Who is Raadha between Meera
and Krish!
We understand each other
There is only one way
Now don't tell me that you need
time to know someone
And I will say no...
Only one meeting is enough!
If there is a vibe between 2 people
so it is...
My vibe is only with my
cell operator
and nobody send me messages
than that
Thankyou! Bye!
And we won't meet again
You can trust me
But can I trust you?
By the way thanks for coming
on station
When people chat on sms
It won't happen with us
We will be like oldjeans
Perfectly comfortable from
the first meeting
Is everything alright?
Who is this Meera?
When?
That night we met
That night we met you broke
up with her and
you were with me all night,
Whats wrong with you all girls?
I said we broke up
Just 2 hours earlier...
If everything is over between you two
then why she is sending you messages
She is not sending me messages
About what?
You didn't break up with her
Are you calling her right now?
Are you still with her?
So you still have her photographs
in your mobile
I didn't get time to remove it
You didn't get time to remove
her photographs
but you have enough time to flirt
with me on side
You were not on side...
You are really enjoying this...
Do you think I am enjoying this...
But what I am gonna do...
If we would broke up...
so would you do this with me
It's too late...
Why he didn't come yet?
Somebody is coming
Go!
I will be back
Parmindar was fine!
So when did I said something else?
So why did you let her go?
You didn't fall in love with her
She came to dry a towel
Learn the signs...
Her parents would have gone
She is giving you a signal,
She is not like that...
However she is...
But how are you?
I have doubt on you
Are you parts working...
Why you are provoking me?
So do something...
Otherwise someone else will have her...
Girl's mom...
Where are you running?
Come upstairs!
I will slap on yourface
What are you looking at?
You were drying a dried towel?
Where is your scarf...
Whose picture will come on coin
after the freedom?
Nowadays it's some British Minister's
picture on the coin
What is this freedom?
And what will we do with freedom?
I am still free...
Who can bound my freedom?
Freedom is in your mind
Howeveryou have freedom
But you are with her...
Impossible!
Thank God we didn't get freedom
Otherwise she will go to England
Then what would happened to
my freedom
Do you know english?
Yes!
Speak!
You are flirting with mom or her
daughter?
Once I will get that british girl
Not like our indian girls...
What are you doing here?
I am learning british culture
and I am teaching them our traditions...
Go from here otherwise...
Why you are so scared?
They are screwing our country
and I am screwing them,
Who doesn't know you?
This is foryou!
Hide yourself under the bed
Go!
Who?
That Indian guy...
who was running
Amazing!
You six people couldn't catch
an indian guy
Find him!
British were following you
And my papa says...
Enemy of british people is ourfriend
That's why I gave you shelter
You may go now
I know everything about you
Because of your dad's thought we
met today
Thanks to your dad from my behalf
Where are you going?
If dad will see you
I won't need it closer
but if I will have to call you
from the distance...
so from which name I shall call you?
Aradhana!
What happened to your voice?
Next week we have decided to protest
Party people are coming today
Make all the arrangements...
Come!
How are you?
We will keep walking like this?
Who cares?
Keep walking with everyone
Get up!
It's not a time to meet prisoners...
Few village girls came for
prisoner's hospitality
So you also came with them
to meet me
By the way this dress really suits you
Look Jawed!
This love is impossible
You shouldn't love me alot
Nobody should love someone
You are telling this thing to me
oryourself
I know you have done it for me
But love doesn't mean to do
something for someone.
So who loves another amongst
both of us
I don't love you
What's your age?
22 years!
There is a phrase in our village
If 22 years girl lied to someone
22 times
then her most beloved thing
has beloved to Allah
There is no phrase like that...
And I don't love you
One!
I said I don't love you
Two!
You should hold the plant
from the roots
We will never be together
Three!
Put some water!
Yes!
Are you thirsty?
How many kids you want?
When we won't get married then
how we will have kids?
Why we won't get married?
When there will be no love between us
then how we will get married
Eight!
No! No! No!
Eleven!
Why you are coming tojail
from past 4 weeks
Twenty!
What?
Before I say something?
Now let your most beloved thing
belove to Allah
Andjust kill me...
Now we will speak cute things
We are like oldjeans
But after that I will tell you that
ljust broke up with 2 girls...
And you will say
I am the third one...
Everything seems goon in beginning
But later...
Same old fights
Again new connection with some
another guy
Tomorrow for the last time...
Who you send the message?
And Meera too
By the way how did you agree
for this wedding
Jawed's Wedding!
How it happened?
I felt in love once in my life...
And that won't happen again
I thought I shall do something
for my dad's happiness
Shakespear has written something
for every relationship
But totally wrong for me
Whatever happened with me that might
won't happened with Shakespear
My love story actually love stories...
were so complicated
We both loved wrong people
You loved ajobless paying guest
and I assume that movie is a real life
but when the movie was over
We both loved wrong people
I wanted to see you for
the last time
Last time?
Jawed Qadri's wedding...
Why I wouldn't come?
This is for dad's happiness
I should leave now...
It's not good for me to stay
here anymore
Congratulations for life and marriage
I think whatever was between us...
Perhaps that was love
But now we both know...
that's not...
And Radha if you think that whatever
between us
it's not love
then I won't stop you
Which day I and Meera broke up
that was my birthday
Same day me and Radha met...
And Radha please!
Don't ask me...
that when, how, where...
And if you will go from here...
Like you were going
then I will must meet you somewhere...
Make some space
What you have done like...
You are going in hurry
Do you agree?
Do you agree?
Aradhana!
I want to marry with your daughter
Are you insane?
What are you doing?
Look!
If you want to marry her
then you will have to marry
with Mumtaz first
You are allowed for 4 marriages
Let's go!
I will marry with Aradhna four times
Exactly!
Why I hate you Krish?
I love you too...
Rukhsar!
Govind!
