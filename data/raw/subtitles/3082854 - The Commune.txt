- Good morning. Erik?
- Erik Muller, yes.
My condolences.
- Do not worry...
- Anna Muller. "Yes, I know her well."
Can we...?
- So here we are again. - A few years ago, right?
Yes, we did not speak
since I was 22...
I did not get to know...
We announced 900, but should reach
to 1,000,000...
If some buyers
are interested.
- A million?
- Yes. She had refurbished all the kitchen before she died.
Yes, I see.

Her father took good care of her to keep her in the family.
Forget it.
For a million...
I do not know about your
economic situation...
We will not comment on it
aloud.
Only the work should be done...
We will get rid of this.
Good...
- Hey? A million...
- Yes...
It loses sight of the others
in such a big house.
- Do you have evidence of that?
- There are many studies.
The difference between living
together or not...
is that you can see
and listen to the other.
You think of a child for
living in a small house, Erik.
You are an architect, you should live in a big house.
I'm not an architect,
why do you insist on that?
I am a teacher, and people disappear...
in large houses...
You also spend a lot
money on expenses.
And this is only a part
of the 450 square meters.
It is very big, point...
Freja...
Freja, come on, let's try
one thing. Are you coming?
We have to find the highest point
.
Are you crazy? It's so loud.
- Sit down...
I shut the door?
- It was the agreement.
First...
- As high as you can, right? - Are you ready?
Do not wait...
- Not Mom, that's cheating.
- No...
A little more...
You see? We get
heard us easily...
That game is ridiculous.
- It was like Mom said.
- Let's not discuss...
See if you can find me.
Where is it going?
- Dad, just because you lost...
Dad, where are you going? - Erik?
Did you agree
that you sleep here?
Yes, but only for today.
- You wake me up when you get there, right?
- Yes...
Kiss...
- I love you.
- I love you too...
After years of terror,
murders and kidnappings.
This is the case of
behavior control...
where people have their
supervised activities...
being subjected to interrogation
and emotional control.
Now, the summary
of the news...
The relationship between LO
and Social-Democrats...
is such that the union leader
threatens to break cooperation.
Strandvejen...
I came here when I was a child.
We can not afford to live here.
Nor greet people...
Here are the tokens.
She has to go to
the School Roisterer...
Mom, I know where it is.
Anna Miller... pardon,
an autograph?
Fast, we are busy...
I have a pen...
The port.
Shit, a tennis court...
Come on. I spent years here,
if you want to risk it.
Do you remember Torben?
Became professional.
I played with him.
- To the other side...
- You and Torben?
Come on...
Here is the Yacht Club.
We had a boat here.
The old trapeze.
If we move here,
you can play tennis.
You can also navigate...
Honey, we do not have money
for this.
Take off my panties.
Sun... sex...
And sun.
I checked the numbers
twice.
You have not seen all the points yet.
Sorry, can you...?
- Thank you.
- I checked twice...
570 crowns a month for
warming is too much.
We can not stay in this house.
It's too big.
We can call more people,
call Ditty, Ole...
No, we can not...
I know what you want Anna...
I will not live in a community.
I get tired of just thinking about it.
- I'm old for this too...
- I already called Ole.
I'm bored, Erik.
Something has to happen.
Eh?
You talk all the time.
I think it's great when you do it,
I love that...
but I think I've heard it all before.
True...
I have to listen to other people too.
Or I'll go crazy.
It's a big house, wonderful
...
must be occupied
by wonderful people.
- What wonderful people?
- Ole, for example.
- Ole is very interesting. - Oh?
He has not been well since
a while ago...
Is it a wonderful person?
- You love Ole.
- It is...
as a friend
to play football...
Try to imagine what it would be like.
It's exciting.
Can you sleep like this?
- Come here, my old man...
What the hell,
have you employees here?
I'm glad you could come.
- Is this where you grew up, Erik?
- Yes...
Now I understand why you're an extraterrestrial medium.
Yes, it's a big house.
- With orange trees and everything.
- It is good to see them. They look good.
- You too.
What's in the bags?
- My clothes and...
Is there leftist literature in the other?
She's not stupid, is she?
She is very pretty too,
can you give me your number?
Or I can stay by her side
of her, here in the company.
Is this an employment interview?
- May be.
- It can be called...
- How are you? "I'm fine, Anna, thank you."
Only half out of the galaxy...
I walked half fucked.
True... and Marianne?
He went with his singing teacher.
The soprano C,
as we call it.
There was nothing else to do,
then it went...
I'm sorry to hear that.
It's funny to imagine living with you.
And I love them...
True, Freshen?
And, Erik, a community?
Do you have money?
- I already understood.
- I forgot we were talking about...
We were talking about money...
You have no money.
We will do something good together...
Yes... here is very big.
- The rent is not cheap. - Let's solve it...
Did you know that I once saw your father faint with rage?
It was in the pool.
I took care of you, Erik, remember?
And I will do it again, because
I am your friend, Erik.
I got the job,
sorry, Freshen.
What the fuck is he laughing at?
- Call the others too...
- Let's do that.
- And Ditty and Steffen? - Are they working?
As assistant teachers...
It's too much for me.
- Do they talk about Ditty Johansen?
- Then here...
No... here. "It's more for me."
Ole... Ditty Johansen,
is that...?
Yes... that damn.
We can start by
drawing a limit...
Can not we call someone else?
You must know someone else.
We have set a rigid limit.
We will not have problems.
- Established from the beginning...
- Established from the beginning.
Have you created house rules?
Can I? In fact,
are in the middle... well...
- Yes.
- They are in progress...
Yes, you can say that...
are incomplete at this time.
- Can you tell us something, maybe?
- Yes...
Yes, that is...
- Did you do it or...?
- We did not do it but...
- We need rules in the house.
- Yes...
We would like to help
with that.
I just want to add
that rent...
likely to be
very expensive.
- By the conditions of the house.
- That is not a problem.
It has been so long since I saw them...
Sweetie, can you tell them your name?
- He is Vilads, he is 6 years old.
- Hello, Vilads...
He has heart problems,
so sometimes he stays calm.
This sounds serious...
I'm going to die when I'm 9 years old.
How do you know that?
- We do not know.
He took only part of the sentence.
Girls love it.
- And how...
- They gave him few years.
But there are some things
that we have to try before.
So it has to be done.
How many years has she? - How old are you, Freja?
- I'm 14.
- 14? Do you think she's cute?
I'll get to the 9.
It's fast. Then I will be the one who is going to have heart problems.
Well, what do we do?
We vote, do not we?
- It is what is done.
- Yes, to hell... for me it's fine.
- I also.
- Me too...
- Me too.
- You too?
- Then it's a reality.
- Do you want a beer, Steffen?
- Yes.
- Savory?
- I really want a beer.
- It will be very good.
- Welcome.
Well, tomorrow will be with Mona.
Do you speak our language?
I try.
What do you do for a living, Allon?
Different jobs...
I ask it because the rent
of the house is very expensive...
as everyone already
should know...
Do you win...
you win money?
He speaks Danish, Mona, does not he?
I do not understand what he says.
I want to be a part.
- What? What did he say?
- You want to be a part.
Steff says that you work
a little here and there...
So I thought...
Why do you change so much work?
They are almost always
smaller jobs.
You do not like them?
I can imagine other things
that I could do.
- What, for example? - What do you want to hear?
I do not want to go back to that
every now and then, but...
I get the impression that...
you voluntarily change jobs.
Can you just
present that?
Yes, I can.
It makes me curious,
really.
What did he say?
- It makes you curious.
What is your plan for the future?
What do you want?
A plan...
- I want to be successful. - What?
What? You want to be successful?
- I want to be successful.
- Yes...
Success? Shit, what answer is that?
- Why do you contradict everything? - Why do not you respond clearly?
I have some questions
and I want you to answer me...
Why do you want to live with us?
I assume you're the boss here?
No, I'm not the boss,
there is no boss here.
Here we have a community,
agree?
We share things here! - You understand? There is no boss!
Here we share our
things! Can you understand that ?!
- Can you understand that ?!
- Erik.
- How?
- Control yourself...
- Breathe...
- I breathe all the time.
Well, I'm sorry...
This always happens to me. - What did you say?
- It always happens to him.
- People get mad at me.
- It is my aura.
- I do not understand...
It's your aura...
It was nice to meet you...
- Wait, demons...
- You can not talk that way.
I said that
the rent would be expensive.
Then he questioned everything. - Are you crying?
I can not talk to a man who starts crying.
Allon...
Excuse me
Sorry, I did not want to...
No, it's fine.
They have to choose correctly.
- I have no money.
- Forget the money.
We will give you a chance. "I... I vote for Allon.
- He has no money.
- Your welcome.
- Welcome Allon.
- Come on.
Then someone arrives with a
damn floor...
I have never seen this structure. Is it a dairy farm?
For you, Mona.
Then you will share
your house with other people.
Are you sure you want to do that?
- I... I'm sure. "Shit, fantastic, Erik.
- Great.
- Make seven copies.
So Vilads, now you live
officially with Ole.
I feel my ass
froze.
But... Anna? - Dear Anna...?
- Anna? - What?
Today I had a great idea about how to integrate the port.
It is full of things
all the time.
What did you say? Sorry.
- I think I solved the problem.
- I have a good idea. - A good idea?
On how to integrate the pier
and the port system.
A good solution.
You are much sexier.
Much more charismatic.
- Here it is...
- Good day.
- Have fun. "Have a nice day, Ole."
- Good morning.
- Goodbye love...
- Good day for all.
- Goodbye.
Drop the guitar and let's go.
There is nothing that comes gradually. - Jesper?
The last to enter
the door is closed.
Let's be more specific about
your... what's your name?
- Articulation.
- The joint... yes.
You used them in your last
presentation...
as a basis for the construction
of the tipi.
No, it can be very useful.
Tipi. Why tipi, Jesper?
A tipi is a portable object.
Can be placed
in different contexts...
and has the potential...
to vary like
the world of the dreams.
- Same as the tribes...
- Sorry... What kind of dreams?
I mean all kinds... of dreams.
Dreams must be free.
I think that's the important thing.
Do dreams have to do with
architecture? Do you believe that?
Your dreams,
nor your project...
They have absolutely nothing to do with architecture.
They give no insight into how
people can cohabit.
Why should I listen to this nonsense? And...
why should I spend
35 minutes...
to hear about your experiences in Peru?
Or your impressions about
some music...
some spice of
work for flute...
That's interesting
for one person, Jesper.
Can you guess who?
I was going...
But, I wanted to know the reason for your
behavior so severe.
My severe behavior? "Yes... Jesper."
- Do you know him?
- Yes.  You know it. That in itself
should already be something unbearable...
Did you have to humiliate him?
- He humbles himself.
He is an imbecile.
Simple and stupid.
What can I do for you?
Can you give me a cigarette?
Feel at home.

What's your name?
My name is Emma.
I am in third year.
- And you are my...
- Yes. Well, Emma, third year... What do you want?
- In addition to defending your friend.
- Talk about my project.
It's okay. Let's set a day to do it.
Let's say... on Tuesday.
In the canteen, at lunch?
And now,
during the cigarette?
This...
It can also be.
It is also...
an option.
That yes, you do not have much time.
I have to take the bus.

- True. Exciting, is not it?
And...
Do not you think it's time?
I sought the inspiration
in the Modulor de Le Corbusier...
and their vision of the need
of the people.
That does not seem to interest you.
I imagine you have read
many things...
on the Modulor
and the Voisin Plan...
and you do not have your own opinion on that.
Search for something else. How old are you?
Why do you want to know?
What are you passionate about?
- I do not know.
- You need to find out.
- Do you have a view of Nyhavn?
- Yes, Nyhavn...
There is a view...
you just have to lean and you'll see
Kongens Nytorv.
Fantastic...
And Křbenhavnstrup.
Did you float there when you were a student?
Yes. And you?
You can bet it... but that
was a long time ago.
You can.
What can I?
Kissing...
And I can see how you are...
and I may like...
Do you want a glass of wine?
- Yes.  I wrote in my chronicle that the product of anarchism is order.

Anarchism rightly says
that no one should rule.
- Do we have an agenda?
- Yes it's time for "How are we?".
I feel butterflies in my stomach,
when I wake up in the morning...
in this wonderful house with...
all you fools,
running...
and I think now
I have a family.
"Anna, how are you?"
Well... I'm happy.
I am happy with you here.
- Bravo.
- Beautiful...
We've been talking about...
a sound to emit when
does not want to vote.
- Vilads, what should I say? - Bum?
Then, he declares himself neutral.
Or happens...
Is that it? You wrote, did not you?
There's something we wanted to know,
actually, about you, Mona.
There has been some traffic
coming in and out.
A massive move
on the property.
Sometimes, in the store...
We wanted to know how many men you've seen?
What?
We want to know how many are,
are you paying?
Is it just one, or are they all...
men coming and going
through the door?
I'm stingy with my body,
you know it, Ole.
Do you know, Ole? "Not you, Steffen..." That was many years ago.
Steff, how are we to you?
Well, we are... we are...
No, it's you, right? - How is it for you?
Well... I can say.
I'm fine, 90% of the time.
- 90%. Yes?
- Its a lot.
- Allon, how are you?
- I'm good...
- Even though you did not pay the deposit.
- I knew they would bring it.

- What did you know? "I knew you were going to talk about it."
I have no job,
so I have no money...
You live in a huge house,
with a beautiful garden...
If you think I can not contribute,
I move again.
She will now sit
and howl again.
Do I call your mother to sing you lullabies?
Erik, and you? - How are you?
Erik?
- What? - How are you, Erik?
How am I?
Good I'm good.
- I'm fine...
- Very well.
Yes, but it is difficult
to accommodate everyone.
I made sketches
and more sketches...
I try to make it simple, but it gets more complicated...
and loses clarity.
It's so clear in the head...
- Everything is clear in the project. - I showed you yesterday.
Together all
main features...
in a prismatic form.
As a sculpture
live in the middle of the city.
Then... during the
day is a construction...
full of life, right?
But at night, it is like a lighthouse
silent in the harbor.
That's your idea.
That's what you need to reschedule.
It can be imposing
and, at the same time, sensual.
- No...?
- You're smart.
I miss you. I miss you when we're not together.
I miss you, too.
All time...
Look, it's a bit small, right?
= No, there. There's a good one, a little one.
No, I do not think we should...
No, it's very good there.
- He is with his mother. - And this one?
- No...
- Why, Mona?
I think not, we must save it.
It is so beautiful here. You can see it, right?
Are you sad? I'm not going to cut any trees, okay?
Wait... Vilads!
Vilads fainted. - Are you breathing?
- Lives? What happened?
- Call an ambulance.
- He is not breathing.
- We have to take him in the car.
Villads...
Come on.
= No, we are not family.
But you must understand...
that is important to know
as it is.
- They are strict.
- Let me talk.
Good evening. - Who am I talking to?
I am Anna Mřller...
I would like to speak with the doctor in charge, please.
I hope.
She seemed very rushed.
But we must understand,
we live with Vilads.
We live in a community.
You must have heard.
I do not understand your procedure.
If I live in the family nucleus...
I have no more rights?
- What if it was my cousin?
- It's Vilads.
Just arrived
in the car.
- They arrived.
- It does not matter...
- Hello, Vilads!
- Be careful.
What did they tell you?
- Heart rate is normal.
Only oscillated a little.
Hey, boy, I just wobbled...
- Are not we going to have gifts?
- Let's...
No dancing.
No more dancing, we will not...
- Thank you.
- I'm going to take a...
Yes, come on... It's beautiful here.
Here is beautiful, Ole. What?
Freja, dear, I left money
for spring rolls, kisses...
- Hello.
- Hello...
- Who are you?
- I live here...
I thought everyone was
in Ole's house.
No, I did not want...
I was rehearsing a play
in school.
- Who are you?
- I'm visiting...
With whom?
With Erik.
I was leaving.
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Mom.
- Hello Mom.
- Do I bother you?
- Are you lying down resting?
- No, I just arrived.
Did you do well with rehearsals?
You can call whenever you want.
You have the house just for you.
Here is wonderful...
It's a shame you could not come.
I left you money on the table
for spring roll.
Is Erik there?
No, I'm alone...
We have to throw
the boat...
Mom, I have to go.
Dad came...
- All right, honey, say hi.
- Bye.
Hello, Freja...
You were not going to sleep in Sille's?
No, I talked to Mom,
left me alone.
Yes, that...
Is...
- I'm going to take Emma to the door.
- Yes bye.
- It was not intentional...
- What do you mean?
You can understand
what happened here.
But...
Should not have happened. "She should not have been here."
I'll tell your mother everything.
Is it necessary to do that? Is not it better to forget everything?
I do not think so, sweetheart.
It's... I think it's not good
to lie about these things.
I just do not want something to happen.
I was with another woman. "Rather, I'm with another woman.
What are you saying?
Yes, I am with her, sometimes.
I do not do these contests
of presentations...
As I told you.
- Well...
- I'm very sorry.
It was not planned.
Only happened...
And is it serious?
It should be, otherwise
you would not be telling me.
Yes, I think so.
Is she pretty? Should be...
Yes, she is... a student.
- Then, you must be young...
- Yes, it is young.
- Third year.
- Wow...
Are you going to stay away from me?
- No, I'm not going anywhere.
- Good.
But we have to see how we
will do with the rooms, right?
Yes, of course...
True, we have to solve it.
- Freja also knows. - Why?
Because I told him.
Because Emma...
It's her... her name is Emma.
She was here...
I did not know that Freja would be here,
I thought I was going to be with Sille.
- But I...
- It was when we went to the walk.
- Here, by the way. - Here?
- You do not make it easy for me, Erik.
- No...
But I think
we will solve it.
Good evening.
Good evening.
- I love you.
- I love you too...
Freja... Do you like it? - Who?
Johannes.
No.
The helmet?
You can take it if you wish.
I'm going to talk to him
for you.
- See you later.
- Bye.
- Church? Freja, what are you going to do?
- Nothing.
Freja, is too old.
What are you doing?
How long have you been following me?
You do not talk?
I think you're too young
to walk around at this time.
Sorry.
Come on.
Remember to take off your shoes
and dry them well.
You can turn off the light and start
undressing.
And the picture of Pol Pot?
Can I leave it
15 seconds?
# It's Ana's birthday,
today is her day... #
# It's Ana's birthday,
today is her day... #
# and just look at everything
what we are going to drink. #
- They should...
- # Everything we are going to drink... #
- Sudden. When will it be?
- Yes, it's sudden.
- How old are you?
- Congratulations.
You'll be fine. You have wonderful skin and a hard ass.
I was 43 when I entered menopause. You should be happy.
Now, the presentation of the image
of Pol Pot... I think that...
- Eight...
- I'm ready.
Seven, six...
five, four, three...
two, one...
This is TV-Avisen,
good night.
I need to see what
I will receive today...
I do not know...
No...
Is it yours, Kristen?
We just wanted to make sure
that you were going to celebrate.
There are many people here.
Congratulations.
Congratulations, congratulations...
The others are waiting. - See you at home?
Should not we be the three of them alone?
How is my husband?
I have not seen you for weeks.
- You look tired.
- I'm fine.
I'm staying in college,
and that's... difficult.
Yes, it is true...
But, also...
I miss you.
Sorry, really. "I should not say it, but I'm sorry.
- Yes, you can.
- I can not live without you.
But you don’t have to...
I have to find
a place to stay...
We have a daughter...
She's there, right?
But...
I'm totally lost...
I think you should do that.
You must do...
what you consider appropriate.
Things come little by little...
you do not know what will come
in the coming months.
We can not stay on the floor,
at school, at a desk.
We did it.
It was very romantic.
- But there was an apartment. - What did your brother call you?
We have to find a place...
I love you and I will do this...
She can not stay a little...
with us?
Well... that is... is...
Maybe. I do not know...
- It's like Mads and Kirsten.
- I know...
- She can not live there.
- Yes, but it is living and living.
We still live together,
in a certain way.
You still have a room for yourself,
that's it.
Bring it.
Bring it and we will solve it.
Freja... come on.
- And Dad?
- He goes too, I think.
Bring my cigarettes. Do we have an agenda?
Let's start with "How are we?" Allon, how are you?
Yes, I have a little problem.
I lost some things.
What have you lost?
- My brown jacket.
And an LP of songs
French.
- And the cover of my guitar.
- Yes...
What happened to all that? - What happened?
You burned everything, Ole.
You're an Idiot.
When things float around,
are no one's...
and then... they burn.
So, I'm going to write that
you're fine, Allon.
You're good because
you have no more problems.
- Yes, I have no problem.
- Anna...
Anna...
We have meeting house.
The annotations are full
of missing.
- Nothing was pointed.
- We will see that.
You once did not write
mine?
- That's it, I get it.
- I also include mine.
Hello...
They are drinking more beer
than they write.
Hello.
- She is Emma.
- Hello.
- You look great...
- Hi, I'm Ditte.
- Hello, Emma. - She's pretty, right?
- Steffen.
- Hello...
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.
- My God...
- Allon.
It looks like you've come out of
a French romantic movie.
You can not see, Allon.
We were with the meeting of the house.
I am Ole, leader of the pack.
- No, it is not.
- Come on, Ole...
We are reviewing the
expense report. And I want to propose...
- I am Mona.
- an amnesty with beer.
- What?
- Amnesty with beer...
We will use, exceptionally,
the funds of the house...
to cover the deficit
of the beer.
Then those who do not drink
we have to pay?
It's a pain really,
then...
- Yes.
- Well, it's approved.
- Let's start on Monday.
- It's like we do here.
- Then, remember to write down.
- Well, enough is enough...
- The next point is you, Emma.
- Yes...
You and Erik are together
a while ago...
And Erik expressed the desire
that you lived here.
Then Emma...
why are you here?
= I?
- I'm... wow, it's hard.
- Yes...
I do not know...
- How old are you?
- 24.
Good...
I do the Erik
course on rational architecture.
You have to be careful...
It is a very exciting course.
Are you here for Erik?
Or is the idea of living here...
in a community,
what attracts you?
It's Erik now,
because I fell in love.
Sorry, I was getting ready.
- Pleased to meet you.
- The same.
It's okay. Well, Anna, you missed the expense report.
- And it was all good...
- No, it was not.
We have a proposal from Emma
as a possible tenant...
and Steffen will say something
about the dishwasher.
- Do you have anything?
- No.
Agree, continue...
Possible tenant?
- Yes...
- Well...
- Anna, we talked about it.
It was your idea.
I told you we would discuss that today.
I had not understood it so,
so concretely.
I said I could
stay for a while.
- But it seems interesting. - You suggested that, right?
Yes, it may have been...
Sorry, I was very busy.
- I'm sorry, Emma...
- It's okay.
But also...
I do not know if you have to vote for
a possible tenant...
if we do not have the same conditions for it.
Yes... but okay.
I'm just... I did not know what it would be now.
- You did not perceive that alone.
- It did not sound that way to me.
But it was so, then,
we will go forward.
Maybe Anna just does not want to
understand it.
This can be very difficult for Anna.
What do you mean, Allon?
- I think it could be difficult.
Can be...
- I did not understand anything.
- I'm going to get more beer.
- Are we going to continue with the themes?
- Let's vote.
Will not we vote
for Emma's entry?
No, now we are going to vote
to decide if we are going to vote.
How many think we should continue
with the interview and then vote?
Okay, we will continue
the interview and then we will vote.
I think I'm done.
I can come back later.
It's not you, the matter is complicated.
It was a pleasure to meet you,
but...
is a conversation they need
to have without me.
I'll walk you to the door.
- Goodbye. "Goodbye, Emma."
- A negative point, it went away.
- Point for, I think.
It was very dignified.
I think he did the right thing.
Now Emma is part of Erik...
and Erik is an inseparable part of this house.
If we ignore this, we betray the same idea of community.
- Shit, she's cute.
- Yes, and you noticed...
It would be easier if another person
came with two women...
Whoever came in came with two women.
That would be good.
In theory, right?
Would be good for me too, but...
Anna... seeing you like this makes me sick.
I would like to give it a try.
I think it's possible
for anyone who lives here.
I also understand why Erik
fell in love with Emma.
I am not naive.
I know very well that...
people have needs,
so... let's see what happens.
Well, then it's fixed?
We just have to vote.
Does anyone have anything against Emma
pass a trial period?
- Mona, come on.
- I...
- I vote "bum."
- Well, 1, 2, 3, 4...
The community is not
ready to accept...
Emma or another person.
So, Steffen. The dishwasher?
I have one proof of
Mrs. Flint and she's waiting...
that we can buy it.
Bring some plates...
- Is not it too big?
- It's huge.
Steffen, I just think...
I like to wash...
Yes, but it's a lot of work.
- All return here.
- We will...
- Come back here.
- Now?
- Come back here and sit down.
- We are with Mrs. Flint.
Come back here and sit down...
- Come back here and sit down.
- I thought we were finished.
How much time do you need to pack and leave?
- Wait...
- I do not expect anything, that's all.
How much time do you need to pack and leave?
This is my house.
I lived my childhood here...
Nobody will tell me how to live my life.
It is my home!
You gave the house
to the community, Erik.
- There are no documents of that?
- No...
- Technically, it's from Erik. - Why are not there any documents?
Because only half of you
pay your share!
Because Anna and I paid
each crown here!
- So you're the boss now...
- Well, now I'm the boss!
Do not mess with that
and do as I say!
Find another place to stay,
this is my house!
Be calm, Ole, and you, Allon!
Hear what I say!
I'm tired of your shit...
then, find another
place to stay!
Make your bags and find
to another you can control!
I do not want this,
I do not want to, I do not want to!
- I feel bad...
- It will faint.
Bring water, Mona. Erik, Erik, Erik?
- Here is the water...
- Let's solve this, Erik.
- I do not want this anymore.
- Then we're fucked...
Sit down, friends.
- Let's do that.
- I do not want any more.
Hello...
- Are you going to the party?
- No.
I'm only going to be 9 years old.
Oh... that's not much.
Do you know where the others are?
Are we going to fuck?
What are you saying?
No... I think we're going to
have to wait a little.
- Hello, Freja.
- Hello...
I came early, but your father is coming with the move.
- Well...
- Is your mother at home?
Yes... she is upstairs.
Can you take me?
I wanted to greet her correctly.
Not here. "I think she's gone."
- Low. - You go? Well...
I'm sorry, I wanted to get you better.
You do not have to apologize.
Thanks... Freja
She brought me here.
- Well I'm going to shop.
- Yes...
Today I'm going to make dinner. You want to come?
- Exit shopping?
- Yes I would like it.
- Yes.
- Let's...
- Now?
- Yes...
Let's go to our butcher.
Play with the seduction
and you will get a good price.
He does not resist a
beautiful lady.
- Here, thank you. - You want me to take him?
I take the gold.
We know Ole
from the old days.
It was the first person I called.
- Ah. Erik did not tell me.
- No...
I've always had the secret dream of living with Ole.
I understand...
- You have brown eyes.
- Yes...
Yours are blue.
I suggested that you move there.
Yes, I was happy about that.
I thought we could
be fine, all three.
I thought that, after all,
Erik should be able...
- follow your feelings, right?
- I'm very grateful.
If you think
it will be uncomfortable...
- you can also say it...
- I think it's going to be interesting.
I've been trying to get to know you.
I was watching you on TV.
Yes... Yes.
You have a good presence
when you are reading.
Do you? You're very kind.
I've been there for many years.
Yes, I remember seeing you
when I was very small.
Good...
- This is good too, Anna. "It was Anna who did it."
He knows very well.
Give a little more sauce to your child.
- I am against closing the doors.
- I also...
- Do we have an agenda? - We have a diet plan, right?
- Everyone has, you should.
- That's silly.
Rarely is so nice
here...
- Did anyone talk about closing? - Shut up?
- Maybe... Steffen knows. - No one else knows?
We have to remind Frřken Jensen.
(author of cookbooks)
- Be careful...
- When are you going to grow up?
I will eat at Sille's house.
Do not you want to eat anything?
- By the hair, she is ready.
I will eat at Sille's...
I only go to Sille's house.
- You turned red. - She flushed, did not she?
I think it's fine,
do not listen to them.
What time are you coming back?
- I'm going.
How cute...
Come here.
Even with the end of the
Vietnam War, tensions increase.
Diplomatic efforts
to avoid war...
between Vietnam and Cambodia
stagnated.
The new war is already a reality.
Pay attention...
We enter at 17:48...
If you have a guest,
I think it can give, at most, 2:40.
It's almost lunch time,
we have a deadline.
The main holder will be
an appropriate topic. Cambodia.
If Cambodia were there...
It's okay.
How many dead children must you have?
Do not show dead children.
The death toll is millions.
- Millions?
- Yes, when it's all over...
Then we put the worst pictures,
say, three minutes...
The last time there was something like this,
we had numerous connections.
Something wrong?
- I do not know what is happening.
You need wine.
I have something else
strong in my wallet.
Take...
- We'll be fine...
- If everything is fine.
- I do that.
- Yes...
We will be fine.
- It's okay.
- Yes.   Once upon a time there was a king...
That made a terrible experiment.
Took 60 newborns...
and fed them...

But, half of them could not be touched by anyone.
Without any physical contact...
of any kind, ever.
But they had so much
rest, food...
and vitamin like
the others.
What happened to them?
- They...
They died.
Do not we have to hug each other?
- It needs to be touched.
Go to dad...
We are ready.
Ten, nine...
eight, seven...
six...
five...
four...
three...
of the...
I can not...
Get Anna out of there. Put Preben
in his place, towards him.
I can not.
Ven...
Come on, the sign...
Let's go to DR.
Did you get the message?
I think that's necessary.
I do not need that, Leif...
You are not well at this time.
- Yes, but...
- It's been a long road.
Do not get me...
is not so much.
- The decision has already been made.
- You can not do that.
Can not decide on my life
that way.
- I do not decide anything.
- You have no right to get me out!
You have no right to remove me.
Calm down... breathe deeply...
breathe deeply
and search within you.
- Enough is enough...
- You have problems.
I can handle it.
I'm a professional, you know.
You need something else.
It is necessary for you to do good things
for yourself, ordinary things.
Go to India,
talk to Sai Baba.
You can not talk to me about
is way, you can not!
I've been here for years...! "You can not talk to me like that!"
Can you reach me the Vilads plate?
- Yes, sorry...
- Where is Erik?
- At school, work late. - You want chicken, Freja?
I want a little too.
I always drink in this cup.
Thank you.
Hello dear...
Hello Anna...
You have food, if you want.
- I...
- Yes, here it is.
Where have you been?
Where have you been, my dear?
How?
I was working.
I have not seen you for days.
That sand in the hand,
did you fall...?
What do you care?
- Hey?
- I am sorry.
How are you?
I did not see you on TV...
Good...
I'm going to work,
she's going to study...
But beyond that, we do the same things.
We wake up in the morning...
We eat at the same table...
We drink the same wine
and go to bed...
with Erik.
What did you say?
No, it is not.
Not for a long time.
Only in my little...
stupid and retarded
old head.
No, I go to bed alone,
but, other than that, we do the same.
You probably have a son later, right?
- No, I'm not pregnant.
- Good...
I know it all the time...
Or rather, I listen...
- all the time. - All the time, what?
- Do it and...
- Do you hear behind the door, sweetheart?
No...
No, I just stop
near the door.
Should not do that.
Not bad.
Should not do that.
- Anna, are you unhappy with this?
- No...
Dream all the time.
You know, when you wake up...
I would like, for example, that...
He climbed the stairs.
As you sleep,
and you do not realize.
- Who?
- Erik...
Maybe you even know...
but you accept it while you sleep.
He climbs the stairs...
determined, holding
firmly the railing.
Open the door and enter
in my room...
and moves with ease
in the dark.
He knows how to get me,
because he knows my body.
And you know...
has to hold me tight
in a certain way...
and it will take me only three minutes
to finish.
Take your plate, Vilads. "Go eat, Vilads."
It would not take long.
Only occasionally...
Did you ask Emma about that?
Did you ask Emma to go to bed with Erik?
Yes...
Yes, but it was just a dream.
It was just a dream.
- The food is rich.
- Yes...
Do you have any more chicken in the kitchen?
- No that's all.
I can eat a piece...
- What happened? - Erik, can we talk?
Honey, I'm busy,
will have to wait.
Okay,
we are going to talk now.
- Sit down. - What did I do with the cigarettes?
- How are you?
- Do not come with that.
Anna is going crazy.
You have to do something.
I do not have time.
Damn, I do not have time...
This is a contest,
I have to finish.
I can not be a teacher
and take care of women's problems.
Ditte can not talk to her?
The idea of community...
One supports the other. "That's all, that's the idea.
Ditte can not talk to her?
I am the last person to solve this problem.
Erik, they were together
for 15 years.
I understand why she
feels bad.
It is completely isolated.
It is very unfortunate.
She does not know how to live without you.
This is different for women.
I heard about your problems
all the time. Non stop.
I feel in a hole, in my own house, and try to work...
But I have to solve women's problems all the time.
I can not. "Damn... I have to work.
When do I go to work? When will I sleep?
If I had nothing, I would have peace. When do I go to work?
- Calm down.
- shit...!
- Well, since we're...
- Steffen... no.
- That was very appropriate...
- It's okay, Anna.
Everything will be fine.
This works well, even
getting off the tracks sometimes.
And you have overcome a huge challenge,
that's why it's so sad.
I think we should
make an assembly.
We have to find the book.
We're just going to clean up a bit.
If we wanted
the house to be maintained...
We have to determine who
of you two stays, I believe...
Or we go.
Okay, too...
It's the best, right?
- Yes...
Are we going to vote
about who should move?
Well, then...
we will do that.
Let's do a round, okay? - Monona?
No, I do not know...
- Ditte?
- Bum.
-Steffen?
- Bum, too.
- Bum.
- Yes, bum...
Well...
then we will not continue.
No, we will not. Because you're the one who has to figure this out.
We can not vote
on someone we love, heck...
You need to solve it. "It's what we're trying to say.
You need to solve it,
you two... or three.
- Hello, Anna. "Hi, Erik.
Yes... here we are.
Yes...
Do you want to move?
No.
And, Erik, do you want to move?
No, I do not want to move.
I do not think anyone here
should move.
I want to continue living
here with my daughter...
For as long as possible.
I also want it.
And what do you say, Freja?
Maybe for you - that means more.
Freja can not decide.
Quiet, let me say something.
- What do you say?
- That's irresponsible.
Who is irresponsible? "You completely insulted me.
You do not touch me,
do not touch me!
- Stop screaming that way.
- You can not solve this...
Who did this?
Sit down and stop screaming.
Calm down...
Erik, heck, it does not work out
nothing shouting.
You were the one who wanted it,
it's your fault.
I want to say something.
I've never seen anyone so sad - how Mom is now.
Mom, I think this place destroyed you.
You are not the same.
I can see...
Indeed,
that is horrible...
So, I think
you should move.
As fast as possible.
I think you can...
Mom, I think you can
get over this.
- Freja, sweetheart...
- I just need air.
Freja...
Church?
Church?
We can do this
in silence.
- Do what?
- Burn your things.
Mom, Mom...
Please do not do it.
Leave that...
- I'll burn it...! "Mom, do not burn anything!"
Yes...
It's okay, Mom.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
Everything will be fine.
Yes...
Everything will be fine...
I wanted to apologize, Freja.
You helped me,
you should know...
Are you going to travel?
Yes, for a few weeks. "I'm going to find a place to stay."
I love you.
Come.
- Ole! - What are you doing?
Are you seeing it?
- It's a dishwasher...
- Allon bought it.
Where did you get the money?
- What is that?
- A dishwasher.
What do you say, Ole?
- I'm not interested.
Why do machines have to take care of everything?
No, Allon...
You are rude and cold
like ice.
Then you can wash
your shit alone.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hello, Freja.
Sorry for the delay.
"Sorry",
you can bet that yes...
Peter, sit here.
Where the hell did you find that doll, Freja?
She is cute.
Enough, Ole.
Sorry, I'm teasing you.
- I believe...
- What do you think?
I loved the dishwasher.
Allon...
Allon, I'm sorry.
I love you.
Wait. Come here, excuse me.
I love you.
If you read the newspapers,
you will see...
How does love disappear from the world...
and see a new time
and an interesting start.
Maybe because of that...
Vilads has found
a better place to live.
Vilads could barely live the time of love.
Peter is waiting for me.
I'm leaving...
Good...
Be careful, my dear.
See you soon...
Goodbye.
- See you later?
- I'm not leaving.
- See you later.
- Very well, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Emma.
- I thought it was very nice.
Sorry...
It's okay, Erik.
Just listen to this.
What is it?
Peter...
I love you.
It is better to stand to walk
on that pretzel.
How about a little
and kind thought for Vilads?
Health.
