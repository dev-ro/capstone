- Good morning!
- Good morning! Hello!
How are you?
- Fine, and you?
- Well, thank you!
When I'm in Berlin, I always come here
first because of your cakes.
Thanks!
You're welcome.
What do you offer today?
For example, there is some
raisins wreath left,
- and poppy rolls, but you don't like it.
- That's right.
And there's the classic
Black Forest cake,
here in the middle.
- Tell me in English?
- No no.
I trust you.
This please,
and a double espresso and
a box of cinnamon cake.
- Cinnamon cake.
- My wife loves it.
- Sit down please!
- Thank you.
- Here you are!
- Thank you.
- For your wife.
- Thank you.
- Everything was fine?
- Yes thank you!
Can I ask you something?
My son has a birthday in Israel,
and I have no idea what to buy.
Do you have any idea of
a typical German gift?
- How old is your son?
- Six.
And what are you doing here in Berlin?
I work for an Israeli-German company.
Town planning, train project.
I know a toy store
specializing in steel trains,
hand made and painted.
- You could get a train for him.
- Yes, that's a good idea.
Would you come with me?
It would be good if a
real Berliner would drive.
I'm not really a Berliner, but...
Of course, I can accompany you.
Or Tai!
Yeah, honey, it's your dad.
How are you?
Yes?
What happened in the school?
Are you a good boy?
Are not good with your mother?
I'll be back on Thursday.
I'm going to get you from school
and we are getting pizzas.
Okay, sweety, you too.
I love you very much.
Pass me your mother for a moment!
Hey what's up?
All right, a little
tired, nothing serious.
Okay okay.
Hello!
Why didn't you call me?
It wasn't planned.
How long are you staying?
Two days.
When will you come again?
At the beginning of December.
I brought a cookie for your wife.
Thanks!
You're welcome.
When was the last time?
On Thursday.
And where?
Home,
in the bed.
What did you do?
I laid down...
then I kissed her.
Exactly where?
The neck,
the mouth,
eyes.
A month.

See you soon.

- Good afternoon!
- Good afternoon!
I'm looking for Orent.
Here?
I'm from Café Kredenz, I
have to give him something.
Oren is not here.
Where is he?
He no longer works here.
Did he quit?
He ordered it and I was in the
neighborhood and wanted to give it to him.
I just want to know where he is.
Please!
I can not really talk about it.
There was an accident in Jerusalem.
His office told us
about six weeks ago.
We don't know any more.
Oren is dead.
Sweet.
Are not you cold anymore?
Personal Data Changing
Hired / Divested

That's it.
You will enter the city hall with
your person and your passport,
you sign it, and that's it.
Okay.
This should be done.
On Sunday, I'm going back to the cafeteria.
What about Itai?
I'll do it before I take it.
Dana will also help.
It'll be okay.
Just be careful not to
overwhelm yourself.
Okay.
Are you coming on Saturday?
We're going next week.
All right?
All right.
Talk to you tomorrow.
Thanks, Motti!
- Hello!
- Hello!
Sorry I'm late, the bus
did not stop at the stop.
I had to wait for the next one.
No problem.
Pastrami?
What's up, Avram?
Thanks to God! How are you?
All right.
Salami? Pork?
Pork? Do not exaggerate...
Here it is.
Just so you can not open it
without certificate.
Thank you, I completely forgot
that the previous one has expired.
No problem, Motti told me.
Good week and good month!
Thanks! I would invite you to a coffee,
but I did not clean the machine...
- Thanks, I drank it.
- All right.
- Good luck!
- Thank you.
Bye bye!

Who's that?
A student here works.

You bring a German to your

Two calls and I'll find
you ten new employees.
What do you want? I like him.
What is the problem?



German.
Stop, he's here,
it's not nice.
All right, he do not understand.
- See you later.
- Okay thank you!















What are you doing?
Did you turn the oven on?
Anat, can not use the
oven, forbidden.
I know we will not sell them.
What is he doing?



If Avram sees it, your
coffee shop is over, Anat!
I know.
Come on, I want to talk to you.





















Hallo?
Yes.
We? But is it okay?

Sixth day. Then the heavens and the earth
and all their hosts were finished.
He finished the creative work
of God on the seventh day,
and made a break on the
seventh day in all his work.
because that day he ceased
all the activities of God,
because that day he ceased
all the activities of God,
with which he created and created.
Blessed are You, our Eternal God,
Lord of the World, who is the vine
fruit.
Amen.
Say 'Amen'!
Amen.
Where does he live?
Where does he live? He lives here
now, but he came from Germany.
Where's his mom?
I do not know.



She has no mother, she grew
up with her grandmother.
Where's your daddy?
All right, you ask too much
questions, this is not...
If you do not want to
answer, you do not have to.


He does not want to answer.
- Good.
- Good?
Black Forest Cake.


He made it himself!
Look what a cake!
Want a slice?
- No.
- What do you mean by "no?
Motti said I did not eat
what Thomas was eating.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Did you say that?
- Yeah.
It's not all right
what your uncle says.
You should taste it,
very delicious.
At least the cream?
You can have the white
part, no problem.
All right.
- OK?
- Thank you.
What's new?
- Do you have a minute?
- Say it!
Why do not you pick up the phone?
I'm sorry, but you see
what's going on here.
I thought you were coming.
Did you really tell Itai not
to eat Thomas's cake?
Yeah, I do not want him to eat non-kosher.
I do not want him afraid of eating,
whether it's kosher or not.
Forget Itia, think about your coffee shop.
You give me a non-Jew,

people talk, you will lose
your certificate.
I have 60 orders for Friday,
which is his merit.
People come to his
cake and not mine.
- I can not bake. Do you understand?
- All right.
- I have enough of this kosher subject.
- They hear it, quiet.
Then hear it.
I am not religious,
and I do not want to be.
Get off me!

Hi, Motti, how are you?
- How are you darling?
- All right.
- We're out of the movie.
- One minute, and I'm coming, okay?
I'm so sorry, Motti.
One thing is that you only
call when you need help,
but your son wants you to go
to the cinema and you're here.
I made soup for you.
Come on let's go!
Anat, please shut the gas!
Sorry! I...
Sorry!
- What should I do?
- Maybe get some rest.
I do not want to rest, okay?
I want to help.
What can I do?
- We have to get the dough,
very thin, okay? - Okay.
It does not go.
Look!
What did I tell you?
You gotta treat her well.
You have to warm your hand.
Flour and then...
It's too cold.
Roll it out.
Keep going, okay?
Simply...
Do it this way...
Then God blessed the seventh
day and sanctified it,

because that day he ceased
all the activities of God,
with which he created and created.
Blessed are You, our Eternal God
Lord of the World, who is the vine
fruit.
What is he called?
Itajai.
This is my wife.
Do you want to have a baby?
No.
I cannot do what you do.
The family is important.
Not to be alone.
I'm not alone.
There my work...
my apartment...
and there you are...
once a month.
Other people have nothing to do.
They are born alone,
and die alone.
My grandmother always said:
"You must honor what you have."
This is very important.
I grew up with her,
in her bakery, in Gerswald,
in a small village near Berlin.
There were just the two of us.
She died two years ago.
When will you come again?
In a month and a half.
My wife opens a new cafe.
What if she finds out?
It will never happen.
When was the last time?
Yesterday.
Where?
Home.
What did you do?
I kissed her,
here.
And where else?
On her ear...
on her neck...
And then what did you do?
We made love...
We made love.
