Howdy!
Goofy-lookin' buggers,
aren't they?
I'll bet they've
just come off the boat.
It makes you wonder, doesn't it?
What?
What women see in 'em.
Yanks! Yanks!
Yoo-hoo!
Jean! Jean!
Come quick! The Yanks!
Hundreds of them!
As if we hadn't
enough of them already.
Aye. Mother won't be pleased.
But you will, right?
Aye. I like Yanks.
Hey, sugar, you wanna hit?
Why don't you come
ride in here with us?
There's more room
in a tin of sardines!
Yeah, but not as much action!
Pretty country.
Look at all that green, Danny.
It's winter and still green.
Do think they got any more like
that little bus conductors?
Don't you think about
anything else?
I've been three weeks
on that crummy boat
doin' nothin' but pullin' my pud
and scratchin' louse bites.
You're diseased,
you know that, Danny?
Brains all between your legs.
Tea break. That's all I ever
hear around this goddamn place.
Tea break.
That's right, Sergeant.
Fancy a cup?
I got 210 men due here
any minute now.
They're gonna want water.
They ain't gonna get any water
unless you fix the fucking pipe.
It's fixed.
May I ask why it ain't
coming out the other end?
It's waitin'
till it's turned on.
Would it be possible
to get it turned on?
Yes!
After I've had my tea.
Fuckin' limeys.
Why don't you have a cup, Yank?
Calm you down a bit.
Don't call me Yank!
I'm not a damn Yankee.
I'm from Ardmore, Oklahoma.
Hey, honey!
Hey, over here!
Hey, will you look at that?
Dames! I'm feelin'
warmer already!
Forget it. The Red Cross
only do it for officers.
So don't put your uniform on,
and they'll never
tell the difference.
Hey, lookie!
Hey!
Over here!
Welcome to England.
Here have a nice cup of tea.
Welcome to England.
Where are you from? Greenwich,
Connecticut, ma'am.
Hey, keep your eye on the
donut, honey, and not the hole.
Thanks, lady.
Welcome to England.
Welcome to England.
Where are you from?
Louisville, Kentucky.
Honey, it stinks.
Thank you, ma'am? What's
the matter with you?
I think I'm in love.
I think you've been
too long on the boat.
Welcome to England.
C'mon. Get outta here.
Here you are.
Where are you from?
Arizona.
Welcome to England.
Name?
Private John.
Name?
Ruflaw.
Buck Sergeant Danny,
I hear you're quite a boxer.
Golden Gloves.
Keep your hands to yourself
around here, Sergeant.
Name?
Cheer up, guys.
It's a beautiful country.
A little chilly. They
forgot to put the roof on.
What are
the women like here, Captain?
I haven't met one yet. I've
only been here six months.
When do we get a pass, sir?
What's a pass?
Welcome to England.
Psst!
I get the truck for the
orchestra on Saturday.
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.
Could I have one
with the sugar?
And where do you come from?
Burlington, lowa, ma'am.
Stretch out. Make sure those
waistline muscles are pulling.
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning, love.
Morning, Claire.
Won't be a minute
with your overalls.
That's all right, love.
I like them warm anyway.
It was bloody freezing
this morning on the bike.
What shift you on?
9:00 till 7:00.
Not again.
You'll kill yourself,
that's what you'll do.
Doing two jobs,
it's just ridiculous.
It's the same for everybody,
mother, isn't it?
Geoffrey, come and
get your breakfast.
It's on the table.
Coming.
You do look worn out, Dad.
I am, love.
Mind the plate. It's hot.
That's a good girl.
Geoffrey!
Coming, Mother!
Morning.
Morning, lad.
Morning, Geoff. Morning.
Where did you
get that hat from?
Billy gave it to me.
Where did he get it from?
The fish 'n' chip man.
The what?
The chip man.
The kids fetch the fish
and chips for the Yanks.
Billy's the big organizer,
isn't he, Geoff?
The pay is. He's letting me
help him on Saturday.
You'll do no such thing.
Mother!
And take that silly cap off
at the table, please.
Ah, Mother!
Take it off, Geoffrey.
It'll be good
for the kids, Mother.
You like the idea of your brother behaving
like some little scrounger, do you?
Oh, really!
Perhaps that's how
you see yourself, Jean,
a source of amusement
to some foreigners.
With more money than sense.
Honestly!
I think your Ken might have
something to say about that. Dad!
They're only lads,
you know, mother.
Soldiers thousands of miles
away from home.
We should be grateful.
Oh, but I am grateful.
God knows we need
all the help we can get.
But do they have to act
as though...
As though they own the place?
Come on. Move it out!
All back to receiving.
All the way. Fifty yards.
That's a football field.
Fuckin' limey rain.
All right, Private. Right
on back of receiving.
Okay, Sergeant.
What are we gonna do
with all this shit?
5650-008635.
No way, pal. I'm not signing
for something I didn't get.
Look, you got ten
crates of binoculars,
M-18's.
This is a binocular? Come on!
Okay, so they fucked up a little.
It's the army.
What do you expect?
Look, I got a little
Scotch on the truck.
You keep the sneakers,
you get two cases of Scotch.
You tryin' to bribe
a fellow officer?
Come on, will ya?
I gotta get out of here.
I'm shocked. Four cases.
Six. That's robbery!
Look, I don't want
the Scotch for myself.
Look at these poor,
wet, miserable bastards,
outside workin'
their asses off.
These are my men.
I couldn't face myself
if I didn't look after them.
You're as full of shit
as a Christmas turkey.
Yeah, but you're the one
with his nuts in a ringer.
Okay. Six cases.
Thanks. Thank you!
Schmuck!
Convoy 6.
Attention in the mess hall.
Some of you guys haven't
stored your duffle bags...
More onions.
Put the potatoes in then.
Right.
Use some of those left-over bones we got.
Give it some flavor.
Sure thing, Matt.
Cigarette out!
I'll take some of those grits.
How 'bout a couple
of those ham hocks?
Mmm. And a little bit
of greens?
Some gravy?
I'll be back for the
watermelon later.
You do that, here?
Next!
Hold on to it!
Hold on it. Don't let go!
Aah!
We got it! We got it!
Don't lose it whatever it is.
A pass, dummy. We got a pass.
No shit?
I hear some of these girls around
here ain't seen a man for years.
Can you imagine? Years!
Hurry up. Come on! Get changed!
They've waited years, Danny. I think
they can wait a couple more hours.
Any more fares,
please? Any more fares?
Any more fares, please?
Coach and Horses, next stop!
Coach and Horses!
Coach and Horses.
Coach and Horses next.
Come on, now, any more fares?
There you go, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Is he going to be okay?
Who? The Sergeant-Major? Yeah.
He gets down at the Coach and
Horses with his head in a bucket.
What'd she say? I don't know.
How far you goin', loves?
And no cracks
from you, chickie face.
I've heard it all before,
you know.
Town, is it? The first time?
Cat caught his tongue?
He's shy.
A very shy boy.
Scared of women. Oh!
Two fares, please.
One-six pence, two pennies.
Ciao, love.
Any more fares, please?
Did you hear that?
She called me "love."
I don't think it's personal.
Last stop now.
Come on, everybody out!
This is it. Little America.
Ciao. Terminus.
Come on, lads! All out!
This is it! As far as we go.
Is this town?
Just a couple
minutes walk, love.
Follow that road there.
Okay. Thank you.
Hey, cherub?
Me?
Come 'ere.
Here...
Just in case you get lost.
What's it say?
It says we're
going to the movies.
Well, all right.

Leslie Mitchell reporting.
The latest films to arrive
from the Burma front show...
Sorry we were late,
but it was so dark,
we couldn't find the place.
It's a blackout, Chuck.
They got no trouble bombin' ya.
They like that,
the Jerries. Nasty.
Shh!
Name's Danny. Mollie.
This is Matt. Hi.
This is Jean.
Glad to know ya, Jean.
Shh!
Sure glad to know ya, Jean.
Do you mind? I'm tryin'
to watch the news!
The object of
this particular attack
was to obtain identification
of Japanese troops
reported to be in occupation.
Cigarette? No, thank you.
Oh, ta!
Did you see that?
Shut up!
Listen, you gotta be quiet.
She's tryin' to watch the news.
Fish 'n' chips
four times, is it?
That's right, love.
Eating them now, love?
I am! I'm starving!
Help yourself
to salt and vinegar.
Here ya are, Jean.
There's nothin' on 'em.
Thanks.
There you are, soldier.
Get that down,
and you'll not feel so bad.
You ain't kiddin' me.
No. Two shillings
and six pence.
Take him aside and teach him.
It's best to do it now, and do him
right, left and bloody center.
Now, son, what's yours?
Fish 'n' chips, please.
Thirty-six times.
Oh, no!
Jesus Christ!
Don't look like a boxer to me.
What do you mean? You know
what they call me in the ring?
Boom-boom. Boom-boom?
No, really. Boom-boom, 'cause
I got power in both hands.
Boom-boom.
Find 'em somewhere else, too.
Oh, braggin' again, are we?
We're not having a very
good time here, are we?
No, I'm fine. Really.
You been out
with an American before?
No. Maybe that's
what's bothering you.
A girl gets a name
goin' with Americans.
I ain't gonna give
anybody a name.
And my mother... I mean my
family has a shop here.
See you tomorrow, Jean!
Mollie, wait a minute!
Hey, Matt, see you
back at the barracks.
I really must go.
What are you so scared about?
You don't have to be
scared of me.
I'm not scared.
'Cause, I tell ya. I'm the
one that ought to be scared.
Think about it...
Here I am, God knows where,
God knows how long.
I'm out with the first real
English girl I ever met.
And that's pretty scary.
I told you it isn't you.
Somebody else? No.
He's in the army? Yes.
We're getting engaged
when he gets leave.
But you're not engaged yet.
So you can see me again.
I don't understand. I told
you there's no point.
Just like to see you
again, that's all.
Like tonight. We could
go take in a movie.
Get something to eat,
go for a walk.
No fancy moves.
You just want a girl.
The woods are full of girls.
Well, pick yourself one.
Look,
you never, ever met
anyone like me before.
Well, no one as modest, anyway.
I didn't mean it like that,
like braggin'. But...
I feel like I never met
anyone like you before.
Well, I'm not that special.
Sure, you're special!
Look, everybody's special.
First of all,
you're a foreigner...
Oh, I see.
Are we in America now, then?
Well, you shouldn't have
trouble finding your way home.
I didn't mean it.
Hey, I'm sorry! 'Night.
Hey, wait a minute.
Where are you going?
Hey! It's all right. My mistake!
You got me all wrong!
Hey! Sorry!
I take it all back!
I'm the foreigner!
I don't know how to get back!
Keep going till you
get to the monument.
Thanks a lot.
Where's the monument?
Where did you get it, Annie?
Al Askin brought it home
with him.
The one that was wounded?
Aye. In Africa.
Said he'd have brought the bloody
head as well if they'd let him.
Here's your stamps,
Mrs. Shenton.
Could have been worse, Claire.
Could have been the Yanks.
Oh! I wish it had been,
with a Yank in it and all.
They're my sort of lambs,
the Yanks.
Hi.
Can I help you?
Oh, that's very kind
of you, ma'am.
Is it okay if
I just look around?
Yes, of course.
Tarah! Good-bye, Mrs. Shenton.
See ya. Bye.
Bye.
Are you sure there's nothing
I can help you with?
Yeah. Do you carry...
What do you call them?
Bicycle clips.
We do.
You think I could try them on?
Certainly.
Jean, would you take care
of Annie, please?
Yes, Mother.
Hey! Those are
clothing coupons, love.
Oh, sorry.
Shall I put yours
on account, Annie?
Yes, please, love.
It's Pension Day on Thursday.
I'll have to get meself
one of these, lads.
Pay you cash for that,
no danger.
I can't seem
to find them anywhere.
Come on! You're not
climbing ladders, Mother!
Go and see to me dad's tea.
Oh, thank you, Jean.
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me.
All right.
One pair of bicycle clips.
I wanna take you to the movies.
No, thank you!
I've already told you
I've got a boyfriend. Uh-huh.
Perhaps you don't believe me.
Perhaps you'd like
to see a photograph.
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice.
Maybe I should ask your mom.
Don't you dare! I'm sure
she'd be glad to show me.
Matt!
You remembered my name.
Now, please. Be sensible.
Okay. Let's both be sensible.
Right. Right.
How much to I owe ya?
One shilling, please.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Saturday, at the Ritz, 8:00.
No thanks!
All right, I'm goin'. You are?
Yeah, sure.
Do I look like the kind of
guy who'd cause trouble?
It's okay.
I'll just be back tomorrow.
Good morning, Ivy.
She's round the back.
You're not much help,
standing there staring.
I'm not staring, I'm admiring.
You're early, aren't you?
I'm always early.
You just never noticed.
Here, let me give you a hand.
You'll get dirt
on your uniform.
Uh-huh. I'm used to dirt.
I worked my way
through law school,
collecting garbage.
I thought you washed dishes.
I did that, too.
I did lots of things.
Dug ditches, shoveled coal.
Phone, Miss Helen!
At last, it's him!
Can you bring those leeks in?
Sure. That's what I'm here for.
Tim? This is
getting ridiculous.
It's nothing but phone,
phone, phone all the time.
Why aren't you at school?
I am at school.
They're playing rugger.
Shouldn't you be
playing rugger, too?
Yes, but, Mother, I try.
I'm just no good at it.
They're still bullying me.
I see.
I try my best, Mum.
What do you say, girls?
Hi. Hello.
Fresh, new proper GI's
just came in from the States.
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
Huh? Just kids,
most of them, though.
Ivy, listen,
this is for you, too.
I don't want you
breakin' their hearts.
I gotta turn 'em into
a ruthless fighting machine.
Before you start, Captain,
would you like a cup of tea?
No thanks.
I'm floatin' on that stuff.
I'm just gonna go into the living room...
The drawing room.
It's terrible for all of us.
How do you think Daddy feels
about being away?
How are you, Mrs. Moreton?
Can't complain, Captain. Good.
Yes, I will write tonight.
All right. Chin up.
I'll see you in two weeks.
Yes, all right. See you then.
Yes, bye.  Bye, darling.
I can't play
when anybody's watching me.
I like watching you play.
So angry with yourself
when you make a mistake
as if you weren't allowed.
I like that. It tells
me something about you.
That I can't play
the piano, yeah?
Are you cold?
Well, it ain't Miami.
You don't have to drink it.
What was all that about?
I said no to a cup of tea.
Sacrilege.
I got a letter from Anne today.
Oh, you must be pleased.
Peter hasn't written for weeks.
Well, he'd have written,
of course, but...
She sold our house.
Just like that.
She put the furniture
into storage,
and packed up the kids and
moved in with her family.
Didn't want to bother ya.
She didn't even tell me about
it till after it was done.
She doesn't even
like her family.
Perhaps she
didn't want to be alone.
I wonder why she didn't
tell me, though.
Do you tell her everything?
So far.
I remember
we did talk about it.
I mean, you know, when I knew I
was gonna come overseas here.
The fact that,
you know,
I might not come back.
And she'd be saddled with
all these responsibilities.
That's a bit pessimistic,
isn't it?
Yeah, I think she'd call it
"realistic."
When Peter went away,
we decided we'd play
the whole thing down.
Take it in our stride.
Everyone did. We had to.
Three very long years.
Where would we have been
if we'd been realistic?
Here.
Oh! Thank you.
Here you go, ma'am.
Here you go, ma'am.
Oh!
Stop that!
Hello, Jean.
Hello, Mrs. Bradshaw.
Hey, get a load of that?
Hey, baby!
Hey! How 'bout a drink?
Hey, how 'bout me, lads?
Hurry up. It's dancin'.
Will you look?
Do you like that?
I like it just a whole lot.
It's a shame 'cause
I saw her first.
Three. Three.
Hi, honey, how are ya?
Hello.
We've got
a little problem here.
My stupid buddy went and
bought three tickets.
Yes, I did. You wanna join us?
No, thank you.
Are you waiting for someone?
I'm waiting for
a friend of mine, actually.
Oh, yeah?
Boyfriend, girlfriend?
Give the lady a drink. Come on.
Have a drink.
I don't care for one.
What do you think you're doin'?
Do you want it in your neck?
Hey, Sarge, come on.
Do you want a drink?
Oh, Matt! Matt, please!
Come on.
Oh! Not bad for a Scotsman.
What did you say yours was?
Half 'n' half. Half 'n' half.
Bob? A chaser.
Two chasers and also...
Uh-huh, chaser... He's
not half-bad, is he?
Right, son.
What can I do you for?
Yeah. I'd like a sherry, and...
A half 'n' half.
Half 'n' half coming up. Okay.
New in? Yeah, just last month.
Pretty cold, eh? Cold!
Cold I can take. I don't
know about this wet, though.
You'll get used to the wet.
Another couple of months
you'll be
coughing your bloody guts up
with the rest of us.
Now, then, sweet or dry?
What do you think?
Sweet.
Bloody Yanks.
Bloody Yanks comin' over here.
Why don't you bugger off
back where you bloody belong?
Look, sir...
I didn't ask to come to this country.
I was drafted.
If you got
any kind of influence,
I'd be grateful to get the
hell back where I belong.
The sooner, the better.
Sherry?
Take no noise, lad.
He just lost his boy... Burma.
Fellas?
One pitcher.
A pitcher and half 'n' half.
Comin' up.
Sometimes I got a big mouth.
I say things I shouldn't.
How do you drink warm beer?
Well, it should be easy
with a big mouth.
Same, George.
That's our diner. Right there.
Just outside
of Tucson, Arizona.
I own that free-and-clear.
Or Dad does, anyway.
That's him.
Dad and my brother, Eddie.
The pretty one there is me.
I'm the, uh, short-order cook
there, mostly.
Short-order? Yeah,
hotdogs, hamburgers,
cheeseburgers.
Oh, you mean snacks?
Yeah, I guess so. Snacks.
Adam and Eve on a raft!
You know what that is?
Two poached eggs on toast.
You got a nice smile.
Thank you.
You ought to smile more often.
Where's your mother?
She died when I was a kid.
I don't remember her too much.
After the war, are you going
back to work for your dad?
Not a chance.
I haven't told
anybody this before...
You know what a motel is?
Well, a motel
is kind of like...
A hotel on the highway.
You know, you stop off at.
You got your own little cabin
and bathroom there.
They're springing up
all over the States now.
I'm gonna build me one of them.
I got a place
all picked out, too.
It's up in a canyon...
Top of a canyon.
It kind of flattens out.
I'm gonna build it right there.
It's beautiful.
Up there I'll be able
to see wide open spaces.
The roads are straight.
Not like here.
When I come here, I...
I feel kinda hemmed in.
You know?
Anyway...
That's what I'm gonna do.
I'm sure you will.
I will.
And when that one gets goin',
I'm gonna build another one.
And then I'm gonna build
another one,
and another one.
Your guy, does he
bring you up here?
Ken? Yeah, since we were kids.
Known him a long time, then?
We grew up together.
That can be nice.
No surprises anymore.
Are you in love with him?
He's everything
I've ever wanted.
That's not what I asked.
I heard what you asked.
Everybody loves Ken.
Guess all the luck
didn't fall in Arizona.
Morning, Sally!
Get to the back of the queue!
It's for oranges, love.
You mean the one that
was here the other day?
Who wanted the bicycle clips?
Yes, Mother. He's a friend!
You always told me
to bring my friends home.
I'd like you to meet him,
and he wants to meet you.
I've no wish to meet him, Jean.
Well, who the hell are you?
Jean, Jean!
I'm sorry.
He's different, Mother.
He's decent!
Decent. How do you
know he's decent?
Well, plenty of them are!
You know plenty of them,
do you?
No, of course, I don't.
I don't understand how you can
put Ken in this position, Jean.
Knowing how people feel
about these Americans.
Knowing how I feel... He knows about Ken.
He understands.
How do you know?
Because in three weeks,
he's never touched me.
Come on, love.
We'll have it down!
I wish they'd have a bit of patience.
I really do.
I'll be with you
in a minute, ladies.
It's not even
8:30 yet, you know.
Now, look, Jean,
your lad's away in the army.
You can't ride two horses
with one arse.
For God's sake, we enjoy one
another's company. That's all.
He asked me to tell you
before somebody else did!
It doesn't affect Ken and me!
Where do you want this notice?
Where they can see it, love.
I don't want any more
arguments this morning.
I don't feel up to it.
Sorry. I won't be
a minute, love.
Yes.
I thought you weren't
going to open at all!
You took your time,
didn't you, love?
Good morning, Mrs. Brendan.
Nice to see you.
Hello. Come on, it's cold.
No, no. Sorry just one each.
That's it one each. The
misses will sort it all out.
Jean. I don't want to be prejudice.
Honestly, I don't.
So you can ask your friend. Ask him
over for tea on Sunday, all right?
Thanks, Mother.
Let's hope nobody
tells Ken about it.
Now, ladies, let's have
a little bit of order here.
Good morning.
"That is why
I want you to know..."
Want you to know that it
was only an accident.
And I didn't get damaged
anywhere important.
"Damaged anywhere important."
Do you think she'll know
what that means?
Well, she wouldn't know
if she saw you now.
So you'll wanna know that I
won't be able to walk so good,
but I can still, um...
You know.
Mm-hmm. That you can still...
Only I want it to be, uh...
Not, you know, crude.
Why don't you tell her
that you can still make love?
Yeah.
"Was only an accident
"and I didn't get damaged
anywhere important..."
Get out! Now, be off!
Post, Miss Helen!
Get down, I tell ya!
Get down! Barney!
Come!
Morning, Arthur.
How's your grandson?
Oh, he's doing champion,
thanks very much.
There's nothing from
the Navy, I'm afraid.
No, there isn't.
Thank you.
Get out of here!
It's mostly bills.
There's one from Tim.
Ah. Good kid.
If you asked me Miss Helen,
I think it'd be best if...
"Dear Mum,
please let me come home.
"I hate it here.
"They're bullying me
"because they say I don't
try hard enough at games,
"but I do my best.
"I don't want to let
you and Daddy down,
"but I want to come home
so, so much.
"I don't fit in here.
You must understand.
"Please.
"All my love, Tim."
Come on!
Very good!
Not bad. Well done!
Jolly good.
How's Anna?
She's absolutely fine.
She sends glowing letters.
I'm afraid Tim's inherited
all my insecurities.
Oh, Helen,
he'll soon settle down.
We had the same problem
with Patrick
when he first went away
to school, didn't we?
You mustn't give in
to him, Helen.
Nobody likes to see
a boy unhappy,
but you must not give in!
Some take a little longer...
Do you think I should
bring Tim home?
I don't think a kid
should have to
stay in a school
where he's miserable
just for the sake of tradition.
It's a very good school.
He could get over his problems.
Peter and all his family
went there.
You know, Tim's not Peter.
You don't believe in tradition.
Not in that kind.
Neither do you.
Do what you feel,
and never mind duties
and responsibilities.
Those things aren't much unless you
can support them with feelings.
They hold you together
sometimes.
Let them go.
You won't fall apart.
Are ya happy?
I like what I'm doing.
Do you sleep well at night?
The planes keep me awake.
You're incredibly beautiful.
You know?
Thank you.
I've said that
to a lot of women.
I'm sure you have.
I even meant it once or twice.
Nobody's ever surprised me
like you do, you know?
Go with your instincts.
You make it too simple.
Well, I come from
a simple, primitive people.
Mongrels, we got no traditions.
Trust your feelings.
I feel
that you should
go back to the camp.
And I should go up to bed.
Wrong again. Don't
trust what you feel.
Thank you, John.
You do help me, you know?
Well, just think of me
as the Red Cross.
Don't let the planes
keep you awake.
That's the first time I've seen him
cook since he made Mess Sergeant.
Why do you think they promoted him?
Somebody tasted his cooking.
Hey, Matt,
who you poisoning this time?
Fuck you and the boat
that brought ya.
Hey, look,
he's using real eggs!
It's got to be for a girl.
What else
is worth all the trouble?
You ever notice
how much limey girls stink?
As a matter of fact,
it's not just the girls.
All limeys stink.
What do you mean "stink"?
They don't wash or something.
So they stink.
Some stink, some don't stink.
They all stink. Their hair
stinks, their clothes stink.
Everything about them stinks.
I guess we must be getting used
to it, but they still stink.
My girl don't stink.
You don't smell it anymore.
No, I seen her wash.
And I don't wanna hear
no more about it!
Okay, Sarge. Okay.
She don't stink.
Okay.
And even if she did, you know what?
I'd like it!
Table looks lovely, Mother.
Does it look all right?
Are we having ham as well?
He wouldn't know
we were rationed.
Let's hope he likes it, Jean.
Geoffrey, be a good boy. Go fetch
me some chutney, the homemade.
Quickly now.
There's an article here
about the three Roberts boys.
Lost at sea
when the ship went down.
I'd better call round.
Don't mention that near the
American, would you please, Jim?
Why the hell not?
Wouldn't be tactful.
He's not seen active service.
It's the Yank.
Why didn't you
open the door then?
He's not coming to see me!
Hi. Hello.
Would you like to come in?
Thank you.
Hope I'm not late.
No. No.
Of course not.
This is my brother, Geoff.
Geoff, how you doin'?
Hi, I'm Matt. Hiya.
Put her there.
I brought you some things
I thought you might like.
Oh, ta. Candy, comic books.
Can I take your coat?
Yeah, thanks.
Mother, this is Matt. Hello.
Hi. Matt, this is my dad.
Nice to see you again, ma'am.
Appreciate you asking me here.
Mr. Moreton.
How do you do, son?
I have brought this
for you, ma'am.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, look what I got.
A tin of food.
Matthew, isn't it?
Yeah, that's right.
After the apostle?
Here. I hope you won't
be offended, sir.
Oh, thanks.
Offended? No.
Thank you very much.
Aren't you gonna
open yours, Mother?
Oh, nice.
Oh, it's lovely.
And it's made with
real eggs, ma'am.
You made it?
That's right, ma'am, just me.
Why, it really is lovely.
But I don't think we'll have it
tonight, thank you very much.
We've got quite enough already.
We're havin' this tonight.
No danger.
Thanks.
How you doin', Mr. Moreton?
Fine, fine.
This is a beautiful town.
Wonderful, wonderful country.
You don't get fresh ham
like this very often.
It's usually the canned stuff.
Oh, it's nice for us. A
special occasion, you know.
Did you grow these
vegetables yourself?
You have a garden,
I saw it out back.
Oh, Jim is
a very good gardener.
We had a garden
back in Arizona.
I really can't
eat any more, Mrs. Moreton.
Can I have that, please?
No. Can I have
your plates, please?
What's that?
Oh, this?
That's something I sent
the wife from the front.
They came round with the needles
and the ribbon for that.
You made it?
Yeah. Strange, really.
What are these?
Just the medals they gave us.
That's the Victory Medal there
for the 1914-1918 war.
That's what we call
a pineapple.
Pineapple? Yeah.
Give that a try.
Mmm.
Good, isn't it?
Yeah, thanks.
Now we'll try this thing here.
This is a peach.
I can see what
you see in him, Jean.
He's thoughtful, very pleasant.
If it wasn't for Ken...
I just wish
we knew more about him.
That's it, Danny,
kill the limey!
Kill the bloody Yankee!
Stay away from him! Stay away!
Get him! Keep your head up!
Get him on the ropes,
Danny! That's right!
Hit him in the gut!
Come on, go!
Kill that limey!
Keep going, Danny!
Yeah! Yeah!
Danny, get that limey bastard!
You got him!
All the way, U.S.A.!
All right! Danny! Champ!
Ken! Ken!
Hello, Billy. How are ya?
How long ya home for?
Two weeks of freedom.
Let us wear your hat.
Go on, shorty. I'll
want it back, though.
Hello, Mrs. Shelton.
How are ya?
Welcome home!
Thank you. You're looking well.
How are ya, Ken? Not too bad.
Can I carry
your kit bag for ya?
Go on, but no muckin' about.
That's government property.
Come on, shorty,
pick your feet up.
You all right, lad?
Huh?
Yeah. Right.
Come on, snap out of it!
Well, Jean,
you're a grand girl,
and we've watched you
grow up with pride.
Now, we don't
give you away easy.
As a matter of fact,
it'd take a special kind
of lad to persuade us.
But Kenny, well, he is.
You know, us old'uns,
we do our best here at home.
But it's the youngsters
like these two
that have to bear the brunt,
the danger, separation,
and the worry.
So good luck to you both.
And let's hope that
this bloody war's over
by the time we all
get together again
to put the rubber stamp on it.
So come on, raise your
glasses to Jean and Ken.
Jean and Ken!
Congratulations, love.
Congratulations, Jean.
Come on,
you act like she's the
only girl in the world.
You ever hear
"Other fish in the sea"?
Like that one,
right over there?
She's nice,
but she's with somebody.

Excuse me.
Do you care to take
a little twirl
around the dance floor here?
Um, well, I'm just
having a drink, actually.
The lady's with me, Sarge.
She doesn't want to dance.
You say she doesn't
want to dance.
I didn't hear her...
You wanna dance with me?
Well, um, no, thanks.
I'm with friends.
You don't dance
with Americans, huh?
No, I don't dance with Americans.
Shove off.
You don't dance.
I got cigarettes here.
You want cigarettes?
You take cigarettes
from Americans, don't you?
Why don't you have a cigarette?
Have a couple.
Hey, that's my drink!
Maybe some whiskey.
We don't want any whiskey!
Drinks on me!
Bloody hell.
Come on, you!
Come on,
we gotta get out of here!

Jean...
Hey. Hey!
You okay?
Yeah.
Come on, we need a drink.
Let's go.
Teddy!
Teddy, open up!
Teddy, we want a drink!
Come on, he's not here.
Teddy!
Hey, you're gonna
wake everybody up!
Rise and shine, Teddy!
What's the matter with you?
What the bloody hell
is going on?
Do you not know
what time it is?
What the hell do you want?
We want a drink!
Oh, it's you two, is it?
Get us a half and half
so I can get him home.
Half and half comin' up.
Half and half! Half and half!
Here you are, lads. Half's
mine, and half's the wife's!
Shit!
It's piss.
- All right, at ease.
- Wait a minute!
Aw, Jesus...
Hey, take your hands off me.
Sounds to me like you
were lookn' for a fight.
Yeah, I was, sir.
You're the one's been running
with the Moreton girl, yeah?
Yeah, I took her out
a couple of times.
Nothin' serious.
It's very easy to get
involved with women
while you're over here, yeah?
But you gotta remember
it's their country
and you gotta play
by their rules.
Even if you don't understand
'em sometimes. Yeah?
Look, sir, I got drunk,
make a damn fool of myself.
No excuses.
Confine him to the
company area for a week.
If you're caught fighting
again, we'll take your stripes.
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Take a hike.
Nice to have something
to laugh about, eh?
Ken, I... Listen, Jean,
the, uh, the garage.
Me dad says it's mine
when it's all over.
I'd like it.
I can build something
for us out of it.
Honest.
I know you can. I know that.
It would be pretty plain
sailing, Jean, you and me.
Maybe a bit too plain.
If we come through it the same,
at least we'll be
certain, won't we?
Just get back, okay?
Just get back safe.
Come on.
Hey, lads, where ya goin'?
They're not as cheap
as us in london, y'know.
I don't envy that lot.
Lovely, aren't they?
Shall I send you one
for Christmas?
I think I'd rather take on
the flamin' Japs.
Ken...
You're not to worry, kid.
This new lot I'm joinin',
they're not mugs, you know.
Crack troops.
Better than scrubbin' around
in the infantry, eh?
There's something I want...
I love you, kid.
I'll be happy on your say-so.
I'm askin' nothin'.
Ken, please...
I'll be thinkin'
of ya every minute.
Ken, look after yourself!
Look after yourself!
Bye! Don't forget to write!
Good-bye!

Happy new year!
We were at a party in London.
We went up especially.
Happy new year. Happy new year.
Absent friends.
Absent friends.
Happy new year. Happy new year.
I'll go.
No, it's all right.
I'll get it.
Three-four-eight.
Hi.
Oh, hello.
I just want to be the first
to wish you a happy new year.
Happy new year.
Where are you, John?
I'm in the office.
But you weren't on duty.
You should be
celebrating with someone.
Listen, this was a very
canny maneuver on my part.
Was it?
I scored a lot of points
for volunteering tonight.
Did you?
Besides, if I can't
be with you,
I'd just as soon be alone.
Happy new year, Helen.
Happy new year, John.
Good night.
Good night.
Excuse me.
Comin' through.
Here's your beer.
Any more fares, please?
Oh, shut up. I'm just
jingling his change.
Using this.
No, love, take it away.
I'm happy.
Ooh.
Ooh, he's a big lad for a
little lad, aren't ya?
It's like sittin' on
a bloody stirrup pump!
Oh, Mollie, you're disgusting.
You know what you've got, Matt?
Bleedin' time bomb.
She'll blow your bloody
head off when she lets go.
I can't wait.
Whoo!
Got you a beer!
Mind if I sit in?
Sure.
Hey, ain't that the white boy
from the mess hall?
Look at him play! Goddamn!
Hey!
Yeah, Charlie! Yeah!
Gorgeous!
Oh, yeah! Come on,
Charlie, come on!
Hey, all right! Do it! Do it!
Move over, boy, I'm cuttin' in.
Hey, get out of there!
Get him off the floor, man!
Let him dance!
I don't think
the lady wants to...
What lady? I don't see no lady.
Let him dance!
Do you see a lady?
Cool it, okay? He's drunk.
All I see's a whore
dancin' with a nigger.
Get your hands off me!
Okay, nigger.
Come on.
Come on and dance
with me one time.
That's all. Come on.
Can we please have some order?
Stop it!
Goddamn!
I can whip him!
I can whip you, white boy!
We got to make
an impression on you.
We got to learn you niggers
to keep your place.
It's the MPs.
It's the MPs, come on.
Come on.
Hey, hold it, man. MPs.
Aaah!
Break it up in there!
All right, you!
Let's break it up!
Move out! The party's over,
come on, get outta here!
Never thought
I'd be glad to see MPs.
The guy was lookin' for it.
They would have killed him for
dancing with a white girl?
Some places
you just can't do that.
You believe that too, do you?
You saw what happened.
Come on, let's get outta here.
Come on, Mollie.
Excuse me, would
anyone like to dance?
Do you want to dance?
Come on.
Yeah.
Will you just leave me alone?
Just keep walking.
Just keep walking!
I'm sorry, sir. No more
orders after midnight.
Residents only.
It's New Year's Eve!
It's New Year's day.
We had an extension till 1:00.
It is now 5:00 after.
I've been calling you
for 10 minutes.
Have you? Yes.
I didn't see you.
Good night! All the best!
Don't forget us!
Ma'am... I'm sorry, sir.
It's the law, you know.
What law?
You have to be a guest.
That's right. Staying with
us, sir, in the hotel.
To drink after hours.
A happy New Year to you.
Good night, Mrs. Mooney.
Sleep tight, Colonel.
And a happy New Year to you!
And to you! All the best!
Have you got a room?
If it were only up
to me, I wouldn't...
Pardon?
Do you have a room?
It's not necessary.
Yes, sir, I think
we can find you one.
Good. I'd like a room, please.
Single or, uh... Hmm?
Single. Now, am I a resident?
Yes, sir. Good.
What would you like to drink?
I would like a double whiskey
to go with the single room,
and a sherry for the lady.
Please.
My pleasure.
Thank you.
You like gettin' your
own way, don't you?
I needed a drink.
I left with you because I
didn't want to make a scene.
But if you ever do that to me
again, as if you own me...
What would you do?
I danced with another man...
You were making a point.
He wasn't some other man.
No, he's the kind you're
allowed to beat half to death.
The guy walked in there
with his eyes wide open.
He knew what he was doing.
It was a black guy
and a white girl.
He knew the score.
There isn't any score.
This isn't...
Alabama or somewhere.
And you just stood there.
There was nothing I could do.
You didn't even try.
Here we are, then.
One key, one double
Scotch, and a sherry.
I can't let you have any more.
Whiskey is short, you know.
Keep it.
Thank you, sir.
Just call me if you
require another.
Look, Jean, they dig me
out of goddamn Arizona.
It wasn't even a state
50 years ago.
Dump me in a town
the Romans built,
and you expect me to act
the way you want me to act.
Well, I'd want you
to act the same in Arizona.
Yeah, you would.
I don't know if I can change.
I don't even know if I want to.
We're different people, Jean.
Might talk the same,
look the same,
we just ain't the same.
And I like it.
Why can't we leave it at that?
Because I don't want
to leave it.
I don't want to leave
what we have.
I can try.
I can try, Jean, that's about
all I can promise you.
Well...
Finish your drink
and take me home, please.
Okay.
Kind of a shame
to waste a good room.
Home.
Home.
Good-bye, Anna. Be a good girl.
Your train leaves
Manchester Central
and Tim'll see you on it.
I know, Mummy, you've told me.
Will you take care of her, Tim?
She'll be all right.
You keep your chin up.
We'll laugh about it when
Daddy comes home, you'll see.
Bye! Bye!
Have a good time, both of you!
What do you say, girls?
Grab your coat and hat.
We're goin' on a trip.
I can't go anywhere today,
I've far too much to do.
Let it rest, will ya?
You work too hard.
I took a day off.
You should, too.
And were are you
proposing we should go?
I propose we should
go to Ireland.
Why are we going to Ireland?
Top secret.
Ever been before?
No. I've always wanted to.
Come on, let's move!
Top o' the mornin' to ya,
buddy. How ya doin'?
You got the usual nylons,
bourbon, cigarettes?
We're a little low on cigars.
See ya in about six hours.
Ya got 10 minutes. What?
We gotta get out of here. You
got time for a quick drink.
Make sure that my guys
get three cases of bourbon.
I could use a bar of soap.
What do you say, guys?
Hi, Captain.
No bad, huh?
Top secret, indeed.
Well, you don't understand.
Wars are not fought
with bombs alone.
What can I do you for, folks?
What are you gonna have?
I'd like a cup of
coffee, please.
And I'd like
a bottle of cold beer.
Could I have
a coca-cola, as well?
You can have
anything we've got.
Bring me some change.
Dimes, all right?
I'd love some chocolate.
You gotta look at it this
way, all that stuff out there
is just goin' to generals
and war correspondents.
And all I'm doin'
is diverting a little of it
to the common man.
Democracy in action.
Now you're cookin'.
Cheers.
Good health.
You're not waiting
to see if you won.
You know what the odds are
against winning?
The last guy to beat that
machine was Al Capone.
We flew that all the
way from Havana, Cuba.
How come you haven't
got a roulette wheel?
We're workin' on it.
Give me some more.
I didn't know
you were a gambler.
Neither did I.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Yeah!
Oh, wow!
Fantastic!
It's all in the
attitude, you know.
Well, welcome to America.
Thank you.
For what?
For showing me Ireland.
They're pouring in,
truckloads of 'em!
Mother.
What are you
doing up here, Jean?
There's a shop
to open up, you know.
I'm going to ring the doctor.
This is silly, there's
nothing the matter with me.
My stomach's acting
up again, that's all.
This wartime rubbish
we've got is eating me up.
Go and tend to the shop,
would you, please?
There's thousands of them.
Yeah.
Just think of all them chips.
If we can get two thousand,
tuppence a time,
we'll make a fortune.
I'll do Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
You won't. I'll do Thursday,
Friday and Saturday.
You do Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Welcome to England.
There's a donut there
if you want it,
and there's sugar there.
Tim! Tim!
Tim, what has happened?
I'm not going back.
You won't make me, will you?
I won't make you.
I hate it so much.
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.
I just couldn't take any more.
What happened?
Tell me about it.
Second platoon! Ready? Hit it!
Third platoon! Stand by, go!
Go get 'em!
Come on, you pussies!
On your belly! Come on!
It's great, isn't it? Yeah.
Keep your goddamn heads down!
Keep down or you're dead!
Mitchell, you got the
biggest ass I've ever seen!
Move it! Come on!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
Hey, you girls!
Quickly! Quickly!
Quickly!
Two ounces.
Now, jam, Mrs. Shenton?
Got any shoe polish?
Yes, we do, but I'm afraid
you'll have to wait your turn.
What sort do you
fancy, Mrs. Shenton?
Do you have any lingerie?
Yes, Mrs. Shenton?
Ladies' underwear? Brassieres?
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong shop.
I'll wait forever
for you, sweetheart.
You got any picture postcards?
Can't you see she's busy?
Hold your water, lady,
I was just askin'.
You got any souvenirs?
Anything with
the name of this place.
What's the name
of this place, anyhow?
Jean! All right, Dad!
See what he wants, Jean.
I'll deal with this lot.
I'm in the right bloody mood
for 'em this morning.
Thanks.
What do you want, love?
The soup's boiling over.
Why didn't you turn if off?
Are you crippled or something?
Your mother doesn't like me
messing about in her kitchen.
Mother's in bed.
Oh, no, she's not.
Oh, Claire.
Look, love, go back upstairs.
I thought you were
having a rest.
With all that row
going on in the shop?
What have you got in there?
A cattle market?
The shop's full of new Yanks.
Oh? Who's serving?
Our Geoff and Mrs. Shenton.
I was gonna
bring this up to you.
Jean, where do you keep
the razor blades?
Coming!
Take your pills.
Oh, yeah.
Where are you going?
Newport!
Is that in Wales?
Sure as hell is!
Can we come!
Hey, kid, want an orange?
Yeah!
Hey, kid! Want a can of fruit?
Yeah, thanks!
You bet! Catch!
Here it comes!
Do you wish
you were on the ship?
So long, kids!
I wish I was on it
with you someday.
Takin' you to meet Dad.
I think he'd like you.
He wouldn't know what to make
of you, but he'd like you!
Hey!
I think we should
go to New York City first,
what do you think?
Yeah, we'll do that.
Stay in a fancy hotel,
see a Broadway show.
And we'll take a train all
the way across the country.
A sleeper.
Hmm.
We'll go to...
To Phoenix first.
Then we'll take another
train down to Tucson.
I'll show you the desert
in spring.
Oh, Jeanie...
The flowers on the cactus
are so pretty.
I'd like to see that.
Good. We got a date.
It's a long way.
Yeah, it's a long way
around the corner sometimes.
I know that,
but this is different.
If only my mother
weren't so ill.
I couldn't leave home now
even if I wanted to.
I think you can do
anything you want to do.
I know horses, but I don't
know about these bikes.
Mother, what's the matter.
What's happened?
It's Ken.
He's been killed.
His sister came round.
They had a telegram
at tea time which said
he'd been killed in action.
I hope you're proud of
what you've done to us.
Excuse me, ma'am?
That boy knew.
Knew about you and your
dirty little goings-on
behind his back.
He lived for you, Jean.
He didn't want to come back.
You know that, don't you?
You've as good as killed him.
The pair of you.
You'll have to live with that
for the rest of your life.
You're wrong.
I'm sorry, I really am,
but you're wrong.
Will you just go away, son?
The best thing you can
do right now is just go.
Jeanie.
I'll be all right.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, yes,
you'll see him tomorrow.
And the next day, and the next.
It's what you both
hoped for, isn't it?
Mother, you've no
right to say that.
I'm sorry.
Jeanie, I'll see you tomorrow.
Ohh, Jean!
I'll not see your children now.
I'll never see them,
I know that.
Jean.
Ken is dead. Did you know?
They came and told us.
Yes, I know.
But I think
you should go back to bed.
It's very late.
United States troops
continue to pour
into Great Britain.
While Germany speculates on
the time and the place
or places chosen for
the real second front
invasion of Europe,
more and more troops continue
to mass in these islands
in readiness
for that invasion...
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.
My bags are in the boot.
You seek accommodations, sir?
Yes, a room on the first floor.
Is it the first time
you've been with us?
No. No, indeed.
I'm glad to be back.
Have the car
taken round, will you?
- Sir, have you booked a room?
- Yes, I have.
I'll be back for your
luggage in just a minute.
How have you been?
Oh, very, very good, sir.
This way, please.
I was told by a good friend
that this was a secluded place.
Would you like
to stretch your legs?
Hmm.
It's an incredibly
beautiful country, England.
Oh. Actually, this is Wales.
England's over that way.
Yeah? Then this must be
Welsh Sea? Hmm?
Actually it's the Irish Sea.
The Irish Sea.
That would put, uh,
Ireland over there, hmm?
Mmm-hmm.
Well, nobody ever loved me
for my sense of direction.
Do you remember Ireland?
Mmm-hmm.
I'll never forget it.
What a beautiful girl.
Beautiful country.
Beautiful girls.
Do you think he's
American or British?
Does it Matter?
I like to think
that we get the pretty ones.
Mmm.
She might be a very nice girl.
Well, I hope so.
They might be terribly in love.
Could be.
I'm feeling guilty.
About Peter?
About coming here, in this way.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Well, perhaps I'm not
a woman of the world.
Well...
You'd think she'd have brought
another pair of stockings.
Oh, but he'll buy her
another pair, won't he?
I hope so.
I'm sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, Mrs. Hamilton.
Did you enjoy your lunch?
The fish was awful.
The fish was awful!
We should've had
the vegetable pie.
What is it?
Oh, I was just thinkin'
what a terrific time
we would have had
if that kid of yours
had been good at games.
Thank you for coming.
I was honored.
It was something
I wanted to do.
Matt,
let's get away.
Please.
Take me away.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
What'd you tell your mom?
I'm at me Aunty Maud's.
Nice place she's got here.
Oh, Matt.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I've always wanted you.
Oh, God, I want you.
Don't leave me, Matt.
Don't...
Oh, please, Matt.
What's wrong?
What's wrong, Matt?
Why did you stop?
I don't know.
I really don't know.
You're scared.
You just don't love me enough.
Hey, don't.
Don't.
Don't cry.
Don't cry.
Want some gum?
Drink it!
Go!
Congratulations.
She's only on loan, you know.
Oh, I was...
With a couple of
American kids, you know?
Be you next, eh, Jean?
Here we go.
Come on, you take it.
Come on, Danny, give your
mother a nice dance.
Are you having a good time?
Do you want to dance?
Oh, no. I think you should
dance with the bride.
It's your last chance.
Well, I don't mind, but...
¶ ...shake it all around
¶ You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn it all around
¶ That's what it's all about.
Come on, Jean!
¶ You put your right arm in
you put your right arm out
¶ You put your right arm in
and you shake it all about
¶ You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn around
¶ That's what it's all about
¶ Oh, hokey-pokey, pokey ¶
Jean?
Jeanie.
Danny and Mollie
got your telegram.
It meant a lot to them.
Was it a nice wedding? Yeah.
They seemed happy.
Let's hope so.
Those two go together,
don't they?
Happy-go-lucky.
She always had
a heart of gold, Mollie.
I thought I heard Jean run up.
Something the matter?
I never meant to hurt anybody.
I know that.
It wasn't your fault.
I've got nothing against you,
you know?
Whatever I may have done
I did to protect my family.
All I want is Jean's happiness.
Yes, ma'am.
Take... Take care of yourself.
Wherever they send you.
Yeah.
Yeah, you take care, too.
Try to get some rest.
Leave her alone, please, son?
I think she wants a glass
of water, Mr. Moreton.
Right. I'll go and see to her.
See you again, son?
It's hard to say, sir.
I don't know.
Yeah, well, all
the best, anyway.
Why did you follow me home?
Because I love you.
It's just talk.
It was all just talk,
wasn't it?
About you and me,
and Arizona.
I didn't lie to you.
I've never wanted anyone
like I want you.
You gotta believe that.
Why?
Why should I believe you?
You know,
when I was a kid, I remember,
I used to wake up
in the night scared.
Not because it was dark, but
because I didn't know where I was.
That's how I feel right now.
It's just too fast.
Too much, too fast.
I couldn't leave you here,
with a kid, maybe.
Her upstairs. Ken.
I don't know
if I'm coming back.
I couldn't do it.
Other people do.
I don't give a damn
what other people do.
I've got my own life to run.
I'm not trying
to run your life.
But I was ready
to risk everything.
And you weren't.
No, I wasn't ready for that.
And you're not ready for me.
No.
At least not yet.
You'd better go.
Yeah.
Take care of yourself.
Yeah. That's what she said.
Ma'am, happy birthday, darling.
Thank you. Carrot's marmalade.
Hello.
What do you say?
Oh.
I thought I'd better,
uh, return your books.
You've got a wonderful
lending library.
And I have some bad news. I can't
loan you the truck anymore.
Don't worry, we'll manage.
That means you'll
be leaving us.
You don't expect 'em to
start without me, do ya?
I haven't got enough
programs for all the seats.
Oh. You might find a few more
in the box in the lobby.
Okay.
How's it goin', Tim?
You're looking happy.
I am. Dad's coming home
on leave for a whole month.
We finally got a letter.
That's great.
I finally got one
from Anne, too.
Is she all right?
Yeah, she's fine.
The kids are fine. She's getting
along better with her family.
And she wants a divorce.
Mmm. I'm sorry.
My heart isn't broken.
It's been coming
for a long time.
Peter's coming home
on Saturday.
I think I might just miss him.
Well, I guess
I gotta get back to camp.
Try not to let anything
foolish happen to you,
won't you?
Then we go from the beginning
of the  English Suite.
Look at this!
- One, two, three, four!
- One, two, three, four!
Hey!
One, two, three, four!
One, two, three, four!
Get this to my husband, please.
I can't. Everybody's
confined to the base.
Oh, go on.
Well...
I'll see what I can do, lady.
Okay.
Geoff! Geoff!
The Yanks are leavin'!
Come on! They're givin'
everything away!
I can't. Me mum's dead.
Come on. It's your last chance.
Bye! Bye! Write if you can!
Here you go, kid. I
got no use for these.
Mate, you take good
care of him, won't you?
Chocolate, huh?
Who wants chocolate?
Throw it up. Down.
Yeah! Five! Whoo!
Give me that dough!
Betty Grable, you're mine.
Yeah!
Get off your goddamned asses
and get on these trucks!
Here, kid. Spend it for me.
Oh, ta.
You can split it with me.
Yeah, I will.
See ya at the church.
You're most kind. Thank you.
Take care, Annie.
Did he not send one?
¶ The day thou gavest
¶ Lord, is ended
¶ The darkness falls
¶ At thy behest
¶ To thee our morning hymns
ascended
¶ Thy praise shall sanctify
our rest
¶ As o'er each continent

¶ The dawn leads on another day
¶ The voice of prayer
¶ Is never silent
¶ Nor dies the strain
¶ Of praise away
¶ So be it, Lord
¶ Thy throne shall never
¶ Like earth's proud empires
pass away

Hup, two, three, four!
Hup, two, three, four!
Good luck, lads!
Clearin' out, are ya?
Can't ya see me?
Look! He's older now,
and you've never been
to see him once!
Where's Ernie?
Bye!
There they are!
Hey, love! Danny!
Down this way.
Come on.
Thanks for comin', momma!
Ah!
Bye-bye, momma!
Take it easy.
Bye!
It were a lovely funeral.
You did Claire proud.
This is my son.
Jean, love?
There's a parcel come for you.
It's over there.
Go on.
Get yourself after him.
We'll manage here.
Ta, Dad.
Please, can you stop?
Please!
Please, stop!
Get out of the street!
Please, take me to the station!
Hop in, lady.
He's not in any truck
I've seen!
Where's Ollie?
Oh, please, you must
know where he is!
He's got dark hair
with curls...
Okay, guys, out of the truck.
Jimmy!
Halt!
Bye!
Cigarette, ma'am?
No, thank you.
Let's have a snapshot
for posterity. Come on.
Come on, you guys, smile.
Say "Eisenhower."
Eisenhower. Oh, yeah!
Hey, take it easy, huh?
I'll take it
any way I can get it!
Don't come down here.
There's too many already.
This is a restricted area.
Keep back!
She's gotta be here somewhere.
Mollie!
This area's off limits!
That's far enough! All right!
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry!
Jeanie! Jean!
Mollie!
Mollie, have you seen him?
I must get through!
Mollie!
Jean!
Have you seen him?
Oh, it's hopeless!
I haven't seen Danny for weeks.
Excuse me, people,
I'm pregnant!
Excuse us!
Excuse me, please!
I'm pregnant!
So's half
the bloody town, love!
I'm sorry, ladies. It's restricted.
I'm sorry.
I'm pregnant!
Congratulations,
but it's still restricted.
It's starting to go, Mollie!
Look, I'm sorry. Where
else can we get to see it?
This is restricted. You're
just going to have to go back.
Let's have another go of it.
Excuse us! She's pregnant!
Excuse us!
Excuse me, please!
Perhaps he's on that train.
Jean... I know.
She didn't get that cake!
She got it!
They're here.
Come on, kid.
They're gonna come by.
There they are! I told ya!
Jeanie! Mollie!
Matt! Matt!
Danny!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Take care of the baby!
It's okay!
Okay! I love you!
Take care of the baby!
I'll be back!
¶ I'll be seeing you
¶ In all the old
familiar places
¶ That my heart and mind
embraces
¶ All day through
¶ In that small cafe
¶ The park across the way
¶ The children's carousel
¶ The chestnut tree,
the wishing well
¶ I'll be seeing you
¶ In every lovely summer's day
¶ In everything
that's light and gay
¶ I'll always
think of you that way
¶ I'll find you
in the morning sun
¶ And when the night is through
¶ I'll be looking at the moon
¶ But I'll be seeing you... ¶
