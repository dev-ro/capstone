Ayþe talks about you a lot, Ekrem Bey.
Thank you, Tarýk.
I'm so curious about the umm. .
What it's saying is this.
And it's talking about magic.
'And they knew that the buyers
would have no share of happiness...
In the Hereafter.'
It's from the Koran.
The end of verse 102 of the Cow Sura.
It's a beautiful piece.
Where did you find it?
A present from my father.
He brought it back from London.
Hey, sweetie.
Come back to the table.
Thanks.
After you.
Ekrem Bey,
how long will the excavation take?
It's actually a preliminary excavation.
A week at most.
Great!
Because we'd thought of taking
a holiday in a couple of weeks.
I'd hate to upset your plans
but we really need Ayþe on this dig.
Your wife's one of the best philologists
in Turkey. Really.
Hodja, the documents arrived today.
The ones we were expecting.
A friend in London found me
some
sections of the book we're after.
That copy doesn't have
all the details of the original.
It's thought to be a fake.
On the dig, we'll look for the book
written by Salih Sultan, the Artuk ruler.
Salih's manuscripts contain details
of the Artuk way of life.
Really important details
that haven't yet come to light.
You see, the Artuks were one of
Anatolia's first Turkish states.
Although they were Turkish and Moslem,
their rituals suggest other religions.
Similar influences can be seen
in their everyday life.
The copper coins they used,
for example. .
There's Alexander's dragon on one side
and Arabic script on the other.
Bravo!
Haven't you been conscientious again!
Ayþe was the same at school.
She'd research everything for weeks.
There wasn't a book she hadn't read.
In fact, sometimes she didn't sleep for days.
Don't exaggerate.
Why? Don't you remember?
Didn't you spend nights on end working
on a project with that Cairo professor?
But with good reason.
The guy was gorgeous looking.
Well, maybe it's time to make a move.
After all, we hit the road in the morning.
Don't be too late. Get an early night.
Here's to the dig!
Cheers!
It was a nice evening, wasn't it?
It could have been nicer.
What do you mean?
You drink so much. .
You have no idea what you're saying.
I'm going to bed.
I have a plane to catch in the morning.
Actually, it was a lousy evening.
Stop it, Zeynep. You're drunk.
What do you think you were doing?
All I want is you.
I've told you so many times.
There's no chance of anything like that.
I don't want to see you here again.
You understand?
Piss off!
Your name's Adem, isn't it, my friend?
That's right, sir.
Is it true what they say
about burning that village?
Forget that. Don't think about it.
Hodja, apparently you went on digs
when you were small as well.
That's right. . Ayþe.
I was my grandfather's lucky charm.
He'd take me up on a hill and ask,
"Where should I dig, grandson?"
I'd show him and he'd start digging.
Here, Dayý . .
Thanks, sir. It sets my teeth on edge.
Hodja?
Well, did you ever find
anything unusual?
No, nothing special. 
Just odd bits of pottery.
It's thanks to my grandfather
my Dad became an archaeologist.
"Life is under the soil,"
my grandfather used to say,
A nice way of putting it.
Would you like some?
Thanks.
Actually,
my mother wanted me to be a doctor.
But I'll say this much.
Life, for me too, is under the soil.
Look, you're not to go there.
OK, honey?
Don't misbehave or I'll kill you!
Hey, say hello to my man.
Cemil says hi.
If only you'd become a doctor
as your mother wanted.
Then you'd have given life to people
above the soil.
You wouldn't bother with underneath.
You became an archaeologist. So what?
What was that? Why are you laughing?
What did I miss?
Ugh! You talk to your man the whole time
and want to know everything as well.
Come on now! Everyone out!
At last we're here.
It's such a long way.
And there's still the mules to go.
That's when the real adventure begins.
What a beautiful mill!
Don't stand there gawping!
They're our guests.
Hurry up and get loading!
Greetings!
Greetings! Welcome!
How are you, Amca?
Hello! Welcome!
I'm well thanks. Have a seat.
Hey, guys!
Give us a hand!
You've come a long way.
I'll make some tea.
Don't trouble yourself, Amca.
We're coming!
It's no trouble. You're my guests.
Will it all fit on these mules?
Amca, how long does it take
to get to Dengizhan village?
Dengizhan?
What business do you have there?
The place is cursed by God.
Nobody lives there.
Why not?
Long ago, it was a place of great sin.
It had been
a peaceful, prosperous village before.
Until the day
an elderly sorceress moved there.
Misfortune and calamity followed
in quick succession.
The sorceress convinced the villagers
their girls were to blame for everything.
And so began the evil that
provoked God's wrath.
There was just one man
who didn't believe the sorceress.
He and his wife hid their little girl
from the whole village for years.
One day, his wife died suddenly.
It was tough with no women in the village.
The man wed a young woman
from another village.
The day came when the woman
no longer wanted her stepdaughter around.
One night, she stole away to the sorceress
and had a spell cast on her husband. .
So he would kill the little girl.
That was the beginning of the end.
Disaster followed disaster
until
the village was empty of all life.
Look out!
I don't believe it!
That's all we needed!
What can we do?
He tied them on.
That's obvious. I'd fall off my chair
if you did anything properly.
Hodja,
I swear I strapped them on securely.
Can't we climb down and get the tents?
No way!
We'll sort something out in the village.
Come on! Let's press on.
It's a strange way we're coming.
Here, Dayý . .
Thanks, Sir.
Those tents falling scared me to death.
Dayý , how much further to go?
Don't think about it. We'll get there.
Þafak, believe me! I almost died.
You know what it means
to fall off a cliff with mules?
I'm covered in cuts and bruises.
You hang out by the pool then.
I really miss you.
OK. . Talk to you soon.
Those mule guys are so weird.
Whenever I ask, it's "We'll get there."
Well fine,
but when will we get there?
People from the East are strange.
But that miller was so charismatic.
Dressed in his flowing white robes. .
He's the stuff of dreams.
Like a white bearded mystic, isn't he?
I was fazed by the things he told us.
It's horrific!
Burying their newborn girls. .
I can't get my head round it.
It's like a sick joke.
That guy managed to hide his daughter
from everyone from years.
But the spell was so powerful
that he cut the girl's throat.
Later, when the spell lost its power,
he lost his mind and hanged himself.
Never mind all that.
There are thousands of stories
like it round here.
I mean, they're legends.
Don't say that, Dad.
It could be true.
It's cursed, that village. Cursed.
There you go.
People want to believe it.
No, Hodja. The miller seemed to believe
what he told us.
That's what I felt.
He gave me something.
Look!
An amulet.
Shall I put it on?
Sure.
Girls, watch where you tread!
The rocks are really slippery.
Careful!
Ayþe, you'll fall.
Hold my hand.
OK, OK. Thanks.
There's something in my clothes!
Dad!
Oh God!
Careful, Ayþe!
The amulet!
Never mind.
The amulet?
Be careful, Ayþe!
Damn it!
Oh God!
Ooph!
I fastened the amulet tightly.
OK, Ayþe! You won't find it.
It's disappeared in the current.
Come on, let's go.
Hey, come on! Forget it!
God!
Oh God! ls everything OK?
Are you all right?
Yes.
I told you to be careful!
Thanks.
OK, OK.
Thanks.
I'm soaked to the skin.
Follow the torchlight.
Get some more clothes on.
Sedef, bring me something warm. It's
freezing!
Hodja, I'm getting changed over there.
There was something there.
It was horrific!
Hey, why are you hitting the animal?
It's gone out of its mind!
It's never done this before.
OK, Abi. Calm the thing down. OK,
don't hit the animal.
What the hell's going on?
Be careful. Stick together.
It's like we're going down a well.
Cemil, how much further is it?
I don't know.
I've asked twice, but they won't say.
Where is she now?
In Mardin.
She's gone on a dig to Dengizhan village.
Dengizhan?
Have you given this serious thought?
Yes.
There's no going back, you know.
I know.
Well, why?
Because as long as she's alive
I won't have peace of mind.
What did she do
to make you want her dead?
Everything. We grew up together.
It was always her that was popular,
her that did well.
She meant more to my family than I did.
They always pointed to her as an example.
And they humiliated me.
Even the guy I fell for at university,
even he chose her over me.
I hated her so much
I tried stealing her husband.
But that didn't work.
She can die. Let her die.
Shall I take it?
Where are they going?
I don't get it.
What's wrong, Dad?
Why have we stopped?
I don't know, my love.
I wonder what they're talking about.
They're arguing.
There's definitely a problem.
But we can't understand
a word they're saying.
Don't get excited.
Keep calm! Everything's fine.
What's that noise?
This is as far as we go, sir.
You carry on from here to the village.
What? You're leaving us here?
We won't go to that ill fated village. How
are we supposed to manage the mules?
We'll pick you up here next week.
OK, everyone. OK. .
I don't believe it!
The guys have gone!
Careful now!
OK.
At last we've found the way out.
Come on.
It's going to pour with rain.
Let's find somewhere to sleep right away.
The village looks really weird.
If he'd tied those stupid tents properly
we wouldn't need to find a place to sleep.
I'm exhausted!
I ache all over.
The journey just wouldn't end.
Those mule guys were so strange.
Cemil!
Hodja?
I've tied up the mules. We'll stay here.
Get some light over there.
I'm going outside.
I'm moving to the room opposite.
OK.
The house seems reasonably solid.
Where's Ayþe. .?
Your nose is bleeding.
Great, you have a fire going.
Now look, don't go burning the sausage.
I'm ravenous.
Yes. . Hodja?
Not for me.
Isn't the full moon beautiful tonight?
It's so huge.
Hodja. .
Did you notice that house over there?
Which house?
The one under the moon.
It's weird.
It looks like a cemetery on the maps.
Sedef, get the glasses out
and open the wine, will you?
Hodja, couldn't the maps be wrong?
I don't understand either.
We'll go and have a look some time.
Cemil!
Come on then.
OK.
Let's drink to tomorrow's dig!
Cheers!
Cheers!
Oh God! It picked just the right time
to pack up!
Leave it. I'll fix it.
What the hell. .
Let's drink. .
To life!
Cemil!
Cemil! Cemil!
Cemil, are you OK?
I'm going to bed.
Good night!
Good night!
Why doesn't this lather?
It's well water. That's why.
It'll make your hair all silky.
Are you going to sleep here?
Maybe. The weather's so nice.
Take care. Don't get cold.
How's your face?
It stings a bit, but I'm fine.
Did I scare you?
No.
Are you OK?
Yes. I'm fine.
Ceren. . Is it windy outside?
No, the weather's perfect.
Good.
Excuse me, Hodja.
For God's sake!
What's going on here?
Fuck!
Fuck!
Hodja! . . Hodja!
Hodja, the mules have escaped!
Hodja, the mules have escaped!
Where could they have escaped?
They must be around here.
Sedef!
Yes?
Didn't you hear the mules escape
last night?
No, Dad.
I'll have a look round the back.
What's up?
The mules have escaped.
What?
Well. . What are we going to do now?
How are we supposed to get back
without mules?
The ropes tying them up were snapped.
Someone stole them.
Otherwise where would they escape?
We saw no one, let alone any villages the
whole way. Who could have stolen them?
The mules' saddlebags are here too, Dad.
They'd have taken those too.
Sedef, you slept outside last night.
Didn't you hear any noises?
No, I didn't.
No, they're not
round the back of the village either.
Well, we'll sort something out
when the mule men come back.
Isn't Aydan up yet?
She drank a fair bit. She will be soon.
Get yourselves together
and let's go to the site of the dig.
We still have a lot to do.
Come on, girls.
Let's clear up this lot first.
I told you last night.
This soil hasn't seen a drop of rain
for months, maybe even years.
That's why it's hard and dry.
It's obvious
why no one's lived here for years.
Cemil, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
Don't throw the soil about like an idiot.
There may be things near the surface.
Ceren, the stuff we're looking for
isn't near the surface. No chance! OK?
Hey, Ceren! Where's the other pick?
Right here.
Very funny. Where is that pick?
Down by the other dig.
You want some water?
Later.
Careful there, you lot!
Sorry.
Anyone want some water?
Thank you.
Hodja, water?
Thanks.
You can't even get a signal up here.
Good. It'll give the man a break.
Come on, people.
Let's have a break and something to eat.
Careful, Hodja!
Hold on. . .
There you go, Hodja.
Ceren, grab the map, will you?
I've got it.
Hey!
Hodja, I'm going for a wander.
My God!
You want some cucumber?
Dad, it's pointless digging here.
Let's have a look at your face.
Look.
Weird. .
A creature with triangular teeth. .
Yes, but what are these?
What happened to you?
Nothing. Just insect bites.
An insect? What kind of insect did that?
Look, don't tell me
the mule guys gave you those.
You did have a hard time getting up.
Leave me alone. Fuck off!
Are you OK?
Yes, I'm OK.
Aydan, are you OK too?
Yes.
Where did that boulder come from?
It almost killed you!
Don't just stand there gawping!
I guess it broke off from up there.
The sound of the picks
may have dislodged it.
Aydan almost got crushed.
I saw unbelievable things going on
in that house.
What happened?
I was wandering around there.
I started hearing baby noises everywhere.
I couldn't tell
if they were laughing or crying.
Then. .
The door suddenly opened.
This hoop started coming towards me.
It was about to hit me.
What the hell's going on here?
What is this nonsense?
Come on.
Let's go and check the place out.
Be careful.
There's definitely something here.
You haven't been taking stuff, have you?
Of course not.
But last night. .
What happened, Hodja?
There's absolutely nothing here, Ayþe.
It must be a wild animal.
What else could it have been?
Ayþe, you were saying last night. .
Did something happen in the night?
I had an awful nightmare.
But I don't remember a thing.
Dad! Look what I've found.
I pulled it out of a crevice.
It's deer hide.
There's writing on it.
What does it say?
Something to do with demon spirits.
Spirits?
It could be true
what the miller was saying.
We'll carry on with the dig here.
Come on. Get the tools together
and come over here.
Hey, be a bit careful.
Wait! Hold on!
This is amazing.
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you be careful?
Hodja!
Hodja, look!
It's amazing.
Hodja, it's beautiful.
Judging by the workmanship
I'd say it dates from the 1 4th century.
It must be extremely valuable.
Here, keep it safe.
Keep your eyes peeled, everyone.
We don't want any pieces damaged.
Hodja, I've found a metal box.
That's a snuffbox.
Dad! Dad, I've found a stone.
Don't touch it. I'm on my way.
Leave it to me.
Sedef! Ceren! Bring me the barrow!
It's time to start the preservation work.
There are things turning up
wherever we dig.
This gravestone confirms your maps.
Yes, but it's a surprise to be finding
all these pieces so near the surface.
Now it's clear why the miller told us
what he did.
They tell everyone the same story.
That way no one finds the artefacts.
And maybe the Artuks made up the story
so no one would come here back then.
In that way,
their secrets would remain secrets.
Maybe.
But the deer hide we found today
that was used for the spell. .
That backs up what the miller said.
How can a huge village become cursed
because of a spell?
Why not?
According to the Koran,
whole races were cursed, forget villages.
The Lot, Ad and Semud peoples,
for example.
They were cursed
for disobeying God's orders.
Sedef. .
Those manuscripts you have at home. .
They say sorcery is a serious sin, right?
Both for anyone practising it
and buying it.
Cemil, come here a second.
OK, Hodja.
Sorry.
Ceren, go get a couple more torches,
will you?
If you could do one thing by yourself
I'd be lost for words.
Hodja,
this looks like an especially evil spell.
It's more like a holster, Ayþe.
You know, in the old days
holsters were made of deer hide.
And they'd have decorative detail
on them.
No, Hodja.
This was definitely made for a spell.
Can you get the screwdriver and pliers
from over in the corner?
Hey, come on!
Come on!
My God, what have we done?
Was that you?
What's happened to the generator?
Cemil's trying to fix it, Hodja.
Ceren, I gave you my notebook.
Where is it?
Fetch it, will you?
Ceren, you're covered in blood.
What happened?
What blood, Hodja?
What happened? Are you OK?
Did you cut yourself?
No.
Where's Cemil?
Cemil!
Cemil!
Cemil!
Cemil!
Cemil!
Cemil!
Cemil!
Ceren!
Ceren!
Ceren!
Aydan!
Out! Outside!
Get out!
You killed him!
I told you I didn't!
You killed him!
Stop it, Aydan! OK?
You're out of your mind!
OK! Stop fighting!
Everything will be all right.
Aydan, what are you saying?
You're crazy! You're accusing everyone!
Tell us how you two fixed the generator.
Tell us how you moaned with pleasure.
So explain those bruises on your neck.
Cemil did that last night, did he?
Get a grip on yourselves!
Enough!
You're driving me spare!
Ceren. . What went on there?
I don't know.
Look at me.
Listen, Ceren.
I know you didn't do it,
but I want to know what went on there.
Ceren, how are you doing?
How's your shoulder?
Does it hurt?
No, no. I'm OK.
What happened?
Why did you fight like that?
I didn't kill Cemil. It wasn't me.
Please, believe me.
I know. . I know.
I believe you.
Well in that case, who did do it?
Who is the murderer?
I don't know, Ceren.
Everything's so confused.
Now come on. You go to bed now.
We. .
We had sex.
What?
What did you say?
You mean,
it's true what Aydan was saying?
I don't know how it happened.
Everything happened so fast.
But weren't you engaged to his friend?
How could you do that?
How could you do it with Cemil?
I don't know.
I don't know how it happened.
Cemil's eyes were so strange.
His pupils were all dilated.
It was like he was someone else.
I wasn't me either.
Ayþe, please believe me.
There was weird energy in there.
We couldn't look at each other
after what happened.
I'm so ashamed.
I want to die!
It's OK. It's all over.
Come on now.
Try and get some sleep.
The spell. .
If it weren't for that bastard
my life could have been quite different.
I wanted to study art abroad.
I sat the exams for two whole years.
Then I fell in love with an animal.
After that, I decided to stay here.
I went to the same faculty
so I'd always see him.
And then I became an archaeologist.
So what did he do?
He slept with one of my girlfriends
in our house, our bed.
Aydan. .
Your chest's bleeding.
It hurts.
I want to get out of this goddamn place
right now!
We can't go anywhere
when it's this dark.
I can't stay here with that murderer.
Ceren isn't a murderer.
Sedef, take Aydan up.
There are beings in this village.
What if the things the miller said
are true?
There's something else here.
This isn't the work of humans.
Hodja, tell me who could have done
something so horrific and why.
That thing I saw, whatever it was,
that's what did it.
I'm sure of that.
What did you see?
Just a shadow.
But it was so quick.
It's true what the miller said.
Ayþe. .
You go and get some sleep.
I'll keep guard by the door.
Off you go.
If only this night would end. .
Ayþe, don't be scared. It's me.
What happened? What's wrong?
I had a terrible nightmare.
Ceren has disappeared.
What?
She's not here. Let's hope she
hasn't done anything to herself.
Come on!
We have to find her right away.
So if she didn't do it,
why has she run away?
She can't have done it.
How can you stick up for her still?
Ceren did it. She's the killer.
Shut up! We've been friends for years.
How can you call her a murderer?
You shut up! Who else could it be?
Aydan, Cemil's head was severed
from his body.
How could Ceren do that?
Stop arguing and let's look for Ceren.
I'm not looking for anyone.
I'm leaving this place right now.
We all want to go
but we can't leave Ceren here.
Can't we?
I'm telling you, she's the murderer.
Just shut up!
Are you out of your mind?
No one's going anywhere
until we find Ceren.
Is that clear?
I'm going.
You can't make me stay.
Right, I see.
In that case, get lost!
Give me one of the maps.
No one gives a damn.
Listen, we don't have to look for Ceren.
Let's all go back together.
Let's get out of here now.
How can you say that?
How can we leave Ceren?
God damn it!
The maps and compasses aren't
where they should be.
She took them for sure.
And you were sticking up for her.
You see who's dumping who?
What are we going to do now, Dad?
We absolutely have to find her.
Don't bother looking.
She'll be well on her way by now.
I doubt it.
She's somewhere in the village.
Then look for her!
I won't go after that bitch of a killer!
If you want to get out of here,
get off your backside and help.
Have you got that?
OK, but I hope I don't find her.
Because I'll kill her there and then!
I swear I'll kill her!
Ceren!
Ceren!
You ran for it, didn't you, slut?
There's no point looking for you here.
Where are you, Ceren?
Where are you, girl?
Ceren!
Ceren!
Ceren?
Ceren, are you in there?
Ceren?
Ceren?
Ceren?
Ceren?
Hodja!
Hodja!
What's up?
Have you found Ceren?
No. I've looked everywhere.
She's not here.
Where is that girl?
Ceren!
I can't see a thing.
It's OK. I'm all right.
Ceren!
Ceren!
Aydan! Aydan, what's wrong?
What happened?
It wasn't me.
Dad! . . Dad!
Ceren!
Ceren!
We have to get out of here.
Are the maps there?
What maps?
There aren't any maps here.
I knew you didn't take them.
Hodja. .
We have to get out of here.
I can't leave Ceren here.
I reckon we should go this way.
No, no. It's this way.
I'm sure.
That's how I remember it too.
This way.
It wasn't me.
I saw a shadow too.
Ayþe. .
I saw Ceren there.
She was lying in a pool of blood.
She was dead.
I didn't kill her.
That spirit did it.
You do believe me, don't you?
Why have you gone quiet?
Say something!
I'm telling you, I didn't do it.
Why won't you believe me?
Aydan, that's enough. Be quiet!
Give us a hand.
That's where these bruises came from too.
The spell's to blame for everything.
Shut up, will you?
That spirit raped me.
Stop it!
What's happened now?
Turn that torch on, will you?
God damn it!
What are we going to do now?
Doesn't anyone have a lighter?
It won't work.
It's here.
That spirit's here.
Don't be scared. Keep calm.
Just keep calm.
Stop that!
I told you.
God damn it!
We're back at the same village.
We're never going to get out of here!
The way I suggested was right.
We should have gone that way.
It's like a labyrinth.
Look at that damn moon!
It hasn't moved since we got here.
Time's stopped here.
We're caught in a trap.
I'm not going to that village. I'm off.
I want to try my luck once more.
Hang on! Where are you going?
Let's wait for morning.
Come on!
We'll take all the batteries and torches
and give it another try.
I'll draw the map again.
Ayþe, give my hands a rinse.
You don't believe it but that deer hide
is behind everything that's happened.
That's enough, Ayþe.
Stop talking bullshit.
We must get to the river.
Then we'll be out of here.
Hodja!
I've come to you.
You're here. I know you are.
You wanted me.
Well, here I am.
Aydan!
Aydan!
Aydan!
Aydan!
Where are you? Aydan?
Where are you?
Aydan!
Were you really scared?
Sedef?. . My love?. .
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen the devil.
You're not Sedef.
Who are you?
You still don't understand?
Why?
You can't have done all this.
What are you doing, my love?
Speak to me.
Sedef. .
I didn't do any of this, Dad.
They made me do it all.
Who made you do it, my love?
Tell me who.
It really hurts, Dad.
It's inside me.
I can't stop it.
There's nothing inside you.
Onu durduramýyorum.
There's nothing inside you.
Don't be frightened.
Now come on.
Drop the knife in your hand.
I love you very much, Dad.
I do too.
I love you very much too.
Baby. . Sweetheart. .
Dad.
Sedef. . My love. .
Don't look at me like that.
Professor. . Professor.
My love. .
You still don't understand,
do you, professor?
I'm not your daughter.
Yes, you are.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

Hello. My name's Tarý k Yolcu. I had
a call to say my wife's here.
One moment, please.
Doctor, the patient's husband is here.
Tarý k Bey, come with me please.
Where to?
Where's my wife? ls something wrong?
Your wife had a car accident.
What?
She veered out of control on Eyüp bridge.
She and her friend careered over the edge.
They had no I D on them.
All we found was your number
in the call register of her cell phone.
Well, how is she now?
We did what we could but it was too late.
I'm sorry. My condolences.
Tarý k Bey,
you must come to the morgue with us.
This way.
That's not my wife.
I don't know her.
Open the other one.
Zeynep!
That's Zeynep, my wife's friend.
How do you mean? Your number's
recorded on her phone as "Sweetie".
Can I go?
I have to find my wife right away.
Özlem, cancel all my meetings tomorrow.
And get me to my wife.
