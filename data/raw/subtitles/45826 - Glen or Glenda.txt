To make this film,
that deals with a strange subject,
we have not removed anything,
we have not gone easy.
Many of the minor roles
are interpreted by people
than in real life,
are the same people
than the ones they represent in the film.
It is a realistic film,
impartial but forceful,
exhaustive in the facts,
as they are known today.
You are the
society... DO NOT JUDGE!
Human exploration
of the unknown,
incessant since time immemorial
time immemorial,
reveals many surprising
surprising things.
Surprising... because they
they seem new...
... sudden.
But most of them are not new...
... for the sign of the times.
A life... has begun.
People...
Everyone is going somewhere.
Everyone has their own thoughts, their own
their own thoughts, their own ideas...
... its own personality.
One makes mistakes...
for doing right.
And one is right...
for doing wrong.
Break the ties!
Dance to that tune...
... for which we were created!
A new day begins.
Start a new life.
A life... ends.
Pass me that note.
The reports will tell the story.
I was recently put in jail.
Why? Because I got caught,
on the street, wearing women's clothes,
and I am a man.
It was the fourth time I had been stopped,
for the same reason.
In life, I can't help but dress like this.
Therefore, it is only a matter of time before
of time before I am arrested again.
This is the only way.
May my body rest in
death, forever,
with the clothes I can't wear in life.
Inspector Warren is here to see you, Dr. Alton.
to see you, Dr. Alton.
Yes, send him in, Miss Stevens.
- Hello Inspector, sit down.
- Thank you, Doctor.
I know you are a very busy man, Dr. Alton.
very busy man, Dr. Alton.
Thank you for your time.
Work or pleasure, Inspector?
On the one hand, work.
From policeman to inspector.
Twenty years in this.
I think I've seen everything
a policeman could see.
Still, I wonder if we ever stop learning.
ever stop learning.
Learning from what we see...
Trying to learn something
more... just as a precaution.
Learning makes me a better person.
We only have one life,
and if we waste it...
what's left?
Doctor... I want you
to instruct me on something.
And thanks to that, maybe
save a human being
of a destiny that I witnessed
just a few days ago.
A quadruple wretch.
Cases like this one come to me
like you, every month.
Suicide?
Suicide.
Almost all of us have
our particularities.
This guy's was
quite pronounced...
Yes, but... I don't know if
deserved such an execution.
That's why I'm here, Doctor.
What can we do?
You have a reputation as an impassive
impassive, Inspector.
Is it not the fame
that almost all of us have?
The laws are written. The
The policeman is there to enforce them.
We have a mission to accomplish.
As in other jobs, there is always someone who doesn't want
who doesn't want us to do ours.
In factories, employers often set up suggestion
often set up suggestion boxes.
Even entrepreneurs need advice from time to time.
advice from time to time.
I believe that, in the case at hand,
I need advice.
Maybe it shouldn't have
what happened...
But so it has been.
Maybe next time we can avoid it.
Let's be clear... Are you referring
the suicide of the transvestite?
If this is what you
scientists call
to the man who dresses
dresses as a woman, yes.
Yes, technically and coldly,
that's the term,
however unpleasant
and perverse as it may sound.
But it's not really a derogatory word.
a derogatory word.
Nor is it a vice, knowing the people
the people in question.
Would the sex-change operation do these people any good?
do any good to these people?
I understand that you
stood out in a case
that made headlines
a few weeks ago.
In some cases, yes, in others, no.
The press had a field day with this
August with this topic...
Strange as it may seem, and
as much "August" as they did,
the issue is not new. There have been
many sex changes have been made.
Those who can change sex are the easy cases.
are the easy cases.
But what about those who desperately
desperately,
and they can't change sex?
As in the case of Patrick,
Patricia, the suicide.
I would like to understand, Doctor,
to explain it to me
as well as possible.
The only way to understand
sex change can only be understood
taking 2 completely different
completely different cases.
Two men, with exactly
the same family background,
from infancy to adulthood,
and in light of their own decisions
decisions and destinies.
I would like to hear the
full story.
Only the infinite
infinite depth of the human mind
can tell this story.
Dr. Alton,
although he is a young man,
use the words of the
who knows everything...
In reality, no one can
tell this story.
Mistakes are made.
No mistakes can be made
with human thoughts.
The story has begun.
One could say: "For God's sake".
"SHOCK DUE TO SEX CHANGE"
Why is the world shocked
shocked by this headline?
Why?
"MAN ARRESTED
FOR DRESSING AS A WOMAN".
There was a time, not so long ago
ago, when it was still said:
"Airplanes... Ha!"
"It is against God's will."
"If God wanted us to fly,
would have given us wings".
However... we fly.
Perhaps some people still remember
even greater nonsense:
"Otomobiles? Bah!"
"They scare the horses."
"If God had wanted us
wanted us rolling in the field,
we would have been born with wheels".
Nonsense? No doubt about it.
We were not born with wings,
and neither with wheels.
But in our modern world,
it is accepted that we need them.
Thus, we have corrected what nature has not given us.
nature has not given us.
However, nature has given us
has given us all that.
We have only had to
learn to put together
all these elements to be able to use them.
to be able to use them.
Still, the world is in shock
by a sex change.
"If God wanted us to fly,
would have given us wings".
"If God had wanted us
wanted us rolling in the field,
we would have been born with wheels".
"If God had wanted us to be children
us to be children,
we would certainly have been
been born... children.
"If God had wanted
that we were born girls,
we would undoubtedly have been
been born girls.
Are we sure about that?
Nature makes mistakes,
is demonstrated every day.
This person is a transvestite,
a man who feels more comfortable
comfortable dressing as a woman.
'Travestido' is the scientific name
which designates the persons
who wear clothes of the opposite sex.
Many transvestites wish to be
to be the opposite sex.
This could only
be titled 'On the sly'.
If we give this man
satin lingerie, a dress,
a sweater, a skirt, or the outfit you are
outfit you are wearing,
will be the happiest person
person in the world.
You will work better, think better,
will even play better.
You will be more useful to your environment,
even to his country,
because he is happy.
These things constitute
your comfort.
But why the wig and
wig and makeup?
Dares to go out on the street
with the clothes you want to wear
you want to wear,
but only with a really feminine
really feminine.
Long hair, make-up, clothes...
The profile of a real girl.
Transvestites do not usually wish to change
change their life or their body.
Most of them just want to wear
the clothes of the opposite sex.
Glen is going to marry Barbara,
a charming and intelligent girl
and intelligent girl.
These nails must be cut.
I didn't realize
I was wearing them so long.
Wow, you wear them
almost as long as me,
perhaps even more careful.
One day we should
paint them, just for fun.
And a manicure.
Of course!
Honey, you've invited me
so many times for dinner
in the last 2 months,
that it already feels like
we are already married.
I wish it were like that, honey.
It has been a very long year.
For both.
But now I am
finishing my studies,
finishes the course
at the university,
and at last I am free.
Free? Only for the moment...
How? Ah, of course!
Will you join me for a drink?
In the living room?
Modern man is a hardworking
a very hard-working being.
During the day, it strives to
building the modern world
and its business management.
Their clothes are coarse,

as required by your

At home, what does the
man has for his comfort?
Things for your home:
a wool or flannel robe,
feet imprisoned in the same leather
the same leather as their shoes...
Those are the things you have at your
for your comfort.
Doesn't look very comfortable,
does it?
And the hat?
What about hair loss?
Men's hats are

7 out of 10 men
wear a hat,
as advertised.
7 out of 10 men
are bald.
And what about
with the ladies?
Yes, the modern woman is also
is a hard-working being,
but at the end of the day,
that which is designed for your comfort
comfort is truly comfortable.
Hats that do not cut off
blood flow,
that do not flatten the hair...
Interesting... isn't it?
A simple comparison:
let's go to the origins,
let's go back to the
primitive instincts.
In less civilized
civilized places,
it is man who adorns himself with

such as paintings, bangs and masks.
The true animal instinct

Isn't man the most flirtatious

What if the male were
destined to attract the female?
What's wrong with that?
Where is the animal instinct
in modern civilization?
For women

as established by designers and
designers and commercials.
Ladies... you can feel proud of the situation.
proud of the situation.
Of course, you know
that they are usually men
those who design her clothes,
their jewelry, their makeup,
their hairstyles, their perfume...
But life, albeit slowly
slowly, is changing.
No law prohibits
going down the street like this,
as long as it is possible to distinguish
distinguish between male and female.
But what would happen if this person
person were to go out on the street like this?
What you are doing now: laughing.
doing now: laughing.
However, it is nothing to
nothing to laugh about.
Such is the strange case
of Glen, who is Glenda,
in the same person.
Not half man and half woman,
and yet, man and woman
woman in the same body,
although, apparently, all indications are that
that Glen is a man through and through.
My sister lent me her dress.
Why do you want your sister's
your sister's dress?
I want to wear it for
the Halloween party.
Do you know what they call
boys who wear girls' clothes?
Nonsense, darling. Go ahead and put on
your sister's dress, Glen.
You've always been better
as a girl than as a boy.
Glen put on the dress
for the Halloween party.
It even won the first prize.
But one day, after Halloween...
I wish I knew how to advise you
with these things, Sheila.
Maybe... you could
consult a doctor.
Glen is the one who needs a doctor.
But... when things like this happen
like that with someone so close,
in your own family....,
it's hard to believe.
It's not so much that it's hard to believe,
rather, you find it hard to accept it.
Of course it's hard for me to accept it!
Imagine that one night
I come home with Roy,
or any of my other boyfriends,
and I find Glen like this...
Yes... that would be
difficult to explain.
Yes, to put it mildly!
How can I introduce
my brother to my friends,
if my "little brother" is wearing
my best sweater, my skirt,
... and it is painted like a door?
Glen is a transvestite,
but he is not a homosexual.
'Transvestism' is the scientific name
to designate those
with the imperious desire
to wear clothes of the opposite sex.
But their sex life,
in every way,
is completely normal.
Would it surprise you that this man,
so rough and coarse on the outside,
to wear satin lingerie
under your work clothes?
Well... he carries it.
And here's your friend the milkman, who...
... who knows how to make himself at home.
I can't take it anymore!
He wears all my clothes.
No respect for anything...!
Not even my panties!
It has deformed all my sweaters!
Of course, he has always
bought me new ones, but...
... they didn't last long either!
Your Honor, really...
Lace ruffles...
... on your T-shirts and underpants!
Glen and thousands of Glens across the
country have a serious problem.
Glen is going to marry Barbara,
an intelligent and charming girl.
The problem?
Glenda,
Glen's other self.
The girl who is himself,
his other particular personality.
You look tired tonight, Glen.
Yes, I suppose so.
It has been a long day.
Have you read the newspaper?
No, why not?
A sex change. Isn't it strange?
I wonder how some minds
some minds work.
Well, some are not
happy as they are.
Yeah, but changing
sex... it's very drastic.
If it's the only
way... I'm all for it.
I wonder what I would
I would do in such a case,
if I had the mental confusion
mental confusion of that person.
Or if it turns out that you have
some mental disorder...
Ufff... it's hard to imagine.
Here we are, 2 perfectly normal
perfectly normal,
about to get married
and to lead a perfectly normal
perfectly normal life together.
And there you have that poor guy,
who could never have been happy,
if it weren't for modern medicine...
In the last course of
psychology course, they give us a lot of data,
but I'm afraid that reality
begins where studies end.
Glen has a serious problem.
You have to tell him... and soon.
He has started to notice things:
her nails, her eyes... when she stares at the windows
looking at the shop windows...
... those little details,
so difficult to hide.
You will soon realize everything.
Then there's the thing about the
sweater Barbara was wearing,
the same one Glen wanted to feel
to feel on his own skin.
It was becoming
an obsession for him.
It had to be his.
Glen, honey, what's wrong?
Ah, I think I was in babia.
Are you worried about something?
Why don't you tell me about it?
It is nothing.
A long time ago, when we
we started to get serious,
we promised that we would not
tell each other lies.
Are we going to start now,
because we are engaged?
It's just...
... oh, Barbara, nothing that
a little sleep won't cure,
It's been a tough day.
It is more than that.
Come on, honey, tell me.
Who knows? Maybe I can help you.
If you could, yes...
So there is something...
Yes.
Do I have the right to know?
Yes, you have the right.
But for now, I'll leave it at that....
I'm afraid to tell you.
I'm afraid of losing you.
It can't be that bad.
I love you, and you love me.
And nothing in the world can change that.
I hope not...
I really hope not.
Glen...
Is it another woman?
Pull the rope!
A mistake has been made!
You have to tell a story...
Always the same.
He has not had the courage to tell her.
But he has to do something,
or else forget about the wedding.
Do you tell him now,
before the wedding?
Or do you release it later,
when it might already be
too late for both of us?
The world is a strange place.
All those cars, which
are all going somewhere.
They all carry beings that
their own life.
The world is in shock because
a person has changed sex.
Glenda is also
is shocked,
but for a different reason:
someone like her has had the courage
to do something definitive
regarding your situation.
How much trouble for Glen and all the other Glens!
Glen and all the other Glens!
Perhaps the fear of having their underwear
the underwear they are wearing,
or what they wear when they fall into the arms of Morpheus
arms of Morpheus, god of sleep...
Thank you very much, I'm sure you will
you will like it very much.
If you want to return it, do not forget
to bring the purchase receipt.
Thank you.
Tell me, sir.
I would like a nightgown.
What size?
Twelve.
Color, fabric?
Black, very transparent.
One moment.
We have this one.
Would you like something like this?
With this lace?
Perhaps he stops too long
in admiring the fabric...
Look how transparent
this fabric is.
Yes.
It is 100% pure nylon,
and only $21.95.
And you will never get snags.
But Glen and Glenda,
and all Glens and Glendas,
have an even bigger problem.
- Hi, Joe.
- Howdy, Jack.
Monday again.
I think Monday is the
worst day of the week.
A fabulous weekend
fabulous, and then...
Back to work.
Too bad we were born to work.
Hey, did you read that
guy who had a sex change?
They say it was perfectly normal.
How can a guy who does that to himself be normal?
a guy who does that to himself?
Still...
It takes courage
to get there.
It's a problem that
I don't plan to ever have.
Maybe it's a problem
problem for all of us.
I don't understand you.
Think of that miserable life.
How bad this world must have been for this poor guy.
this poor guy.
I still don't understand you.
A guy who wanted to be a girl.
Suppose there was no way
no way to change her sex.
You seem to have been affected by the issue.
That's right.
Can you imagine what would happen if
all the men in the country
who wanted to wear women's clothing
women's clothes or felt like women,
to the doctor for a sex change?
change their sex?
Of course, that's why I say
that society should be a little more tolerant
be a little more tolerant...
Perhaps society should
understand them as human beings.
Another day... thank God.
See you tomorrow, Jack.
- Hi, Glen!
- Hi, Johnnie.
Go ahead. I'm running to the kitchen,
I can't let my dinner
my dinner burn.
I thought I would have
have to dine alone.
That will surely be the case,
I've already had dinner.
- What's going on?
- Not much.
Wow, you look really bad.
I think I have a problem.
Like everyone else... right?
It's a real problem,
something I had never
I had never had to face before.
Our entire existence
is one problem after another.
I want to get married.
Yes, you have a problem.
When did it all start?
I've been dating a wonderful girl
with a wonderful girl.
Now the time is approaching
to go up to the altar...
and I'm scared to death.
Do you want it?
A lot.
Does she love you?
Yes.
Well, no problem,
marry her!
You forget about the other me...
You have to tell him, of course.
Yes, I have to tell him.
But when?
Before...
... or later?
I think you know that answer.
I'm in a mess.
I can't make sense of anything.
I thought I could stop
wearing those things.
I tried, I really did.
I haven't worn any of it
in almost 2 weeks, until today.
But I couldn't take it anymore.
I had to wear it, or
I would have gone crazy.
I am afraid of losing her.
And I don't want
that to happen, because...
I really love her.
Okay.
Here is a true story.
Johnnie tells his story.
Johnnie was married
recently.
He had hidden his fondness
to cross-dressing,
in the hope that
his wife would not find out.
However, one day...
his little wife came home an hour earlier than
hour ahead of schedule...
That was the end of that marriage.
Do you have the same problem?
the same problem?
Almost certainly yes.
Because their love is not
prepared for such a thing.
She, your wife,
will not have received
sufficient information
on that subject, in order to
to be able to fit it.
Glen / Glenda must
now make a decision.
Or forget about
Barbara forever.
Glen / Glenda should consult
a competent psychiatrist.
But very few transvestites want to forget
forget about their strange hobby.
That is his life.
Taking it off can hurt them as much as cutting off an arm or leg.
as cutting off an arm or a leg.
Or... life itself.
Many take their
their hobby to the grave.
Yes, it is a problem.
But Glenda... do you remember,
almost a year ago, when
Glen and Barbara got engaged?
Good evening.
This is the sixth time you have said
good night.
Yes, it is true.
You see...
Come here for a moment.
What's up?
Never mind, sit down.
Oooh... I thought you
you'd never ask me!
Is that so?
What do you think?
When?
First I have to finish
finish college.
Only 7 months left.
Just enough time for you to
to put together a trousseau.
What would you know about such things?
Glen, what's going on?
What?
Suddenly you seemed to be
thousands of miles away.
Oh yes, I guess so, honey.
What a beautiful dress
you're wearing tonight.
I wear the best I have
I have to please you.
You know, when you look at me,
you captivate me.
I love to captivate you.
How happy I will be when these months
these months pass!
For something special?
Of course...
So that you stop saying goodbye
to me at the door every night.
Is that so?
So that you can always embrace me.
Yes?
You will only have to call me, close
your eyes, and feel my lips...
Watch out!
Watch out for that big green dragon
green dragon in front of your door.
It eats children!
Puppy tails,
and big snails.
Beware...
Be careful...
Watch out!
Glen / Glenda has made a decision.
Glen has decided to tell
Barbara about his split personality.
Tell him about the nightgowns and
and skirts, sweaters and skirts,
gowns and dresses, stockings and
stockings and high heels,
of the wig and makeup.
Everything that involves
turning Glen into Glenda.
He tells her that he cannot hide from her what she, his fiancée, must know.
what she, his fiancée, must know.
The whole truth.
He tells her gently,
first in a hurried manner,
then more slowly, as we go into
going into technical details.
Caress Barbara's soft angora sweater
angora sweater,
that he has so long wanted to wear, desperately
to wear, desperately.
Everything is told, and she looks at
Glen's sweater and hands.
Then, when he has finished
the whole story,
Barbara doesn't know what to think...
That's all, honey.
I have wanted to tell you about it many
times, but I haven't dared.
I was too afraid of losing you.
Glen...
I don't understand all this
too well, but...
maybe together we can work it out.
Is this the end of the story?
Not quite, I'll get back to it
to it right away.
Glen's case is among the least
the least advanced.
The second case is much more advanced.
We will come back to it shortly.
First you have to realize
realize that every cross-dresser
has its own problem.
Each case must be treated individually
treated individually,
according to the person, his or her
past, and their problems.
And isn't it a hermaphrodite?
Nor pseudohermaphrodite.
Glen's case has to do only with his mind, originating from his childhood environment.
originated by his childhood environment.
What about your children, Doctor?
Will the children be like their father?
No. Transvestism is not hereditary.
What drives these men's desire to dress as women?
men to dress like women?
Many things, but as I said, it starts
usually in childhood, for one reason or another.
Technically, each case has the same
beginning, only in different circumstances.
Will any of them ever be cured?
Oh yes, many.
Once the origin is found
origin is found, it can be cut.
Unless the patient refuses to
refuses to cut it.
If I understand it correctly, this Glen
and the character he has created,
as an author would create
a character in a book,
was invented as an object of love,
to replace the love that
love that he missed out on in his childhood,
for lacking the love of his parents.
The character was created and dressed,
lives the life that the
author has designed for him,
and dies only when
the author so decides.
Right, only for the character Glenda to die
the character Glenda dies,
the elements have to be
to be the correct ones.
But to enlighten you a little
more, there is a second story,
of a very advanced case.
We will call her Alan / Anne.
Alan's mother wanted to have a girl.
His father didn't care
one thing or the other.
Alan did not play competitive sports
like the other children in his school.
However, he was very studious
and got very good grades.
But sports, girls' sports, always interested her.
girls' sports, always interested her.
The girls rejected him,
and so did the boys.
He didn't seem to fit in anywhere.
After school, Alan would go home to that mother who always wanted a girl.
that mother who always wanted a girl,
and with his father, who gave him the same.
She liked to do the
housework.
Alan was becoming a woman without realizing it.
into a woman without realizing it.
A woman only mentally,
but... the mind rules.
Then came the year 1941.
Alan was recruited, and he was accepted.
In the army, he overcame
the toughest tests.
He didn't like it, but he had the weekends for his
weekends for his amusements.
During his furloughs, he would pick up a suitcase
that he kept in a locker.
In the suitcase she had the clothes
she liked to wear,
the one with which his body had the appearance that was
appearance that mentally was hers.
The day came to embark.
But wherever Alan went,
his suitcase accompanied him.
The war ended as quickly
as quickly as it had begun.
Alan returned home.
Alan had learned all the terms
terms addressed to men like him.
But no one had
discovered his aversion.
He was discharged from the army with
honors at the end of the war.
He was awarded a silver star and a bronze star
a bronze star for gallantry in combat.
While recovering from an injury in a military
wound in a military hospital,
learned that some doctors were doing wonders with sex change.
doing wonders with sex change.
Male to female and female to male.
Shortly after his discharge from the
from the army, Alan came to consult with me.
Then followed a long series of
long series of examinations followed,
both mine and other eminent
other eminent physicians.
We had discovered that Alan, in
was in fact a pseudohermaphrodite.
Hermaphrodite is a person who has
organs of both sexes in sight.
Pseudohermaphrodite is the one who has
one of the organs perfectly formed,
and one that is not fully formed,
which is difficult to detect.
Alan was the latter.
So, we gave him a choice.
What nature had given him was a mistake.
nature was a mistake.
It was up to us
to correct it, one way or the other.
It was up to Alan to choose
whether he wanted to be a man or a woman.
Both were perfectly
perfectly possible.
It had small bones, soft skin,
fine and feminine hair,
slender body, hips
slightly gynoid...
It was easy to understand his decision.
Besides the fact that he had been
raised as a girl.
Alan decided to become a woman.
This, after all that I did, was only the beginning.
I did, was just the beginning.
For the next 2 years,
he underwent real torture.
But he was never heard to
complaint, because he knew that,
In the end, it would be what I had always dreamed of.
I had always dreamed of.
She was given hundreds of
hormone injections.
Her facial features were feminized.
Long and tedious hours of work...
The big day, or the beginning
of many great days
-because there were going to be a lot of them
a long series of interventions
a long series of interventions,
to avoid unnecessary damage to the nervous system.
unnecessary damage to the nervous system.
Hormones also continued,
day after day, week
week after week, month after month,
even after the sex change
sex change operation,
and should continue for the rest of their lives.
First the breasts.
The woman's body
begins to appear.
Then, the most important surgery:
eliminate men and train women.
But in the end, Alan is Anne,
A happy and charming woman,
created by modern medicine
and modern science,
almost like a Frankenstein's monster.
The press got wind of it, and made
the news to the front page,
with his customary luxury of details.
If the press had not picked up the story
the story,
would have gone unnoticed, like so many others in the history of medicine.
in the history of medicine.
Sex change has been performed hundreds of times.
been performed hundreds of times.
However, in this particular case,
it is only the beginning.
Acting like a woman and being a woman are
two completely different things.
Alan had acted
as a woman all her life.
She IS a woman now, and
must learn how to live.
You must learn to comb your hair,
to make up according to your own
facial features.
Walking correctly...
Because a lady is a lady
lady, in all cases.
In line with my
psychiatric treatment,
it was my duty to explain to Anne the
duties of a woman and her sex life.
Alan, of course, had
known the man's,
but he would soon realize that he hardly knew
he hardly knew anything about a woman's.
Nevertheless, Anne enjoyed it all very much.
all of it very much.
Undoubtedly, Anne was born to be a woman.
born to be a woman.
Now that he had changed sex,
Anne was a very happy woman,
and eager to learn.
She was now accepted by society.
A woman born at the age of 24.
In a world he knew as a man for 24 years
as a man for 24 years,
but a woman at last, adequately
educated to accept
a woman's world.
In this case with a happy ending,
owes all its success to
medical treatments.
I have been involved in several such cases.
In my 20 years of experience,
I have been preeminent in seven of them.
But my colleagues have
had hundreds of them.
So, do you think Glen, the previous case, should change sex?
case, should change sex?
No, not Glen, without a doubt.
He would never be happy
with a sex change.
Does this Alan's case have a happy ending?
I will tell you just as I told them
as I told them.
Shortly after Glen told Barbara about his
Barbara about his cross-dressing,
began to treat himself with me.
The day of the last session,
they came to see me together.
I told them the same
Alan/Anne story,
as I have told it to you.
Anne was a pseudohermaphrodite.
Although one of the sexes was imperfect,
had the organs and characteristics
and characteristics of both male and female.
Glen's case is completely
completely different.
Remember that, whatever the
case, it is always different.
A new problem to explore and solve.
A new challenge for psychoanalysis.
Glen's body has only
has only one sex, male.
Throughout our sessions, I have learned the following pertinent facts
the following pertinent facts:
Glen's father did not
love for his son.
He wanted his son
to be a soccer ace,
or a baseball player.
So he could brag about it to his friends
his friends at the corner bar,
as they did with their own children.
This is the origin of the character
that Glen invented,
a strategy to compensate for the love he did not receive
he did not receive from his father or his mother.
Her mother had hated her own father,
and how Glen reminded him of his father,
gave all her love, attention and affection to her daughter,
attention and affection to her daughter.
So, Glen decided to become a daughter.
to become a daughter.
Glen, you can kill that character
character whenever you want.
If you want the story
end well, it's the only way.
So, you think that
I can kill that character
transferring its qualities to Barbara.
Exactly. But as author and character,
the elements must be the right ones.
It's up to you, Barbara.
You must take the place, give her love and
accept what Glenda has always accepted.
If it is true that you love each other,
it will be hard, but you'll like doing it.
Should I allow him to continue
wearing women's clothes,
or should I forbid it?
If you forbid it, he will do it on the sly.
Love is the only answer.
Glenda must be transferred to you.
What if Glen never outgrows his cross-dressing?
Would you mind that much?
I love Glen.
I will do my best to make you happy.
The end is only the beginning.
Time passes, and soon,
thanks to a happy marriage,
the memory of psychotherapy
psychotherapy sessions,
and Barbara's love and understanding,
Glenda begins to disappear
from his life forever.
Glen has found his mother
his mother, his little sister,
his wife, and his Glenda, all in one precious package.
in the same precious package.
This is how Glen's case
case could have a happy ending.
Therefore, two completely different
completely different,
treated in a completely different
completely different,
had a happy ending.
Yes... those two.
But... what about the hundreds
of other Glens in the world?
Yes, but...
what about the others,
...with the less fortunate Glens,
from the rest of the world?
"What are the little kids made of?
Clippings, snails and tails..."
