Yes, but...
He is an important client of mine.
Take him a small gift will you?
Gift?
Yeah, money.
Say my name and give it to the boxer.
But he's your client, not mine.
Hey...why can't you do a favour for your college...
...just for once.
You'll get a ticket to the boxing match later...buddy!
Don't beep on me, 'buddy'.
Good bye.
My college sends his regards.
Sure.
What's the problem?
Hey!
You look tired. Working too hard?
Everything's fine. It always is at my work.
Go easy with your work.
I can always keep working after we marry.
Well?
Can't I?
I've organised a pension plan today.
Excuse me?
Nothing...
If a guy named Kojima calls me
tell him I'm late home or something.
Who's he?
He's my high school Junior.
I bumped into him today.
Want to avoid him?
Well, no but...
Look...
Noticed I'm wearing the dress you bought me?
Let me out here...please.
His condition's stable now.
He'll be okay in a while.
Hi there!
Hey!
He's been waiting a while.
How'd you find here?
Oh that's easy because...
We are so close...
...Except our living styles.
Kojima gave us tickets to his next match.
He took professional boxing test
straight after high school, right?
Right.
He even won his very first fight!
What did I say yesterday?
He seems like a nice guy.
You're just so irresistible! 
C'mon, guys are like wolves.
What, are you mad or proud of me?
You guys...
...how did you meet each other?
A bakery.
Our offices are close
and I saw him often at the bakery, on lunch.
I later found out he came to see me here, everyday!
Hase, I'll leave them to you.
Is Shirota in?
Excuse me!
Kojima!
You leave when I arrive? You should try what I do.
Then I can keep a check on your level.
Beer makes you fat.
When did you start to feel so tired?
Only recently.
I went to see a doctor because...
I'm paying out for expensive insurance.
- What about the result? - I'll get it next week.
Makes me worried...
When was the last time we did it?
What?
Why?
No...I just...
Oh, I've got an idea. Look at this.
What is it?
A company news letter.
What's it for? Think it's cool?
Look at you! You look stupid with that grin.
I've never seen this smile?
Let's forget it.
Forget it!?
You look like one of those sleazy pinup girls!
Listen, I didn't mean it.
I'm sorry.
It's me, Kojima.
Kojima...?
Tsuda invited me here today.
Do you want to drink some beer?
No thanks. My fight's coming soon
I should be on a diet.
- Your face...? - What?
I mean...
Boxer's faces can be changed from those punches.
Well, it would be stupid just to have your face punched!
Anyway, perhaps I'll have some beer...
You will?
- Look, you've got... - Huh?
...Muscles.
Would you like to touch?
Okay...
...So firm!
How're Tsuda's?
Like a babies to touch, I suppose.
Let me show you what else I've got.
That dress really suits you.
Tsuda bought it for me.
Fuck off!
Hello, honey.
Kojima waited for you.
Kojima? Was here again?
Said you'd invited him.
- Hizuru...? - No, it's me.
I didn't invite you here! What is it you want?
Say something!
Hizuru...
She was very...
Soft.
It's not what you think!
Hi!
Bastard! What the fuck are you after?
I said, what the fuck are you after...!
Kojima, what is it that makes you think you're an infighter?
Kojima!
I didn't know the boss was here!
Nice! That's it!
Move your legs a bit more!
Boss, you should make him into an infighter.
Instead, you're training him in the out style..
The only way to control a coward like him
is to teach him mind control.
Hello...
Oh, the bandage is off now? That's good.
Phone call? From him? No!
A mad dog?
Yeah, he hardly seems a boxer with a license.
Keep it going!
Continue!
Strike him!
Don't waste any time!
Well played!
Are you insane?
Go on, attack!
You're both losers!
The winner is...Takuji Kojima!
Cheers guys.
Why're you here?
Here, happy birthday.
Thanks.
There's something I want to ask you.
Why were you at the boxing match?
Was it only a kiss between you and him?
Why ask again? I've told you enough times.
So, there was a kiss...
You kissed him?
Yes...
But...
You did.
Well, what about the incident before that?
What time was that?
You remember the time.
It was about a year ago...
You kissed him backed then too, didn't you?
Wait!
Please!
I'm sorry...
Don't make me look foolish, bitch.
C'mon! Let me go!
What do you want?
What do you want??
That? ...I wanted to have sex with you.
Not that.
Why did you tell a lie on the phone?
Phone? Oh, it's no lie.
They were really soft.
I don't know what you want. 
But you won't get it.
There you are! I knew it.
Just look at this.
Hope your parents like that.
I'll find out what mine think when I see them tonight.
Nice shot!
Boss, someone's here to register.
- Aoki! - Yeah.
What's this?
I said, what's all this about?
You came early.
You know, I feel like a spar.
Wanna try it?
Okay, that's all!
You're not too bad...for your age!
No, don't!
Oh, piercing your ear.
What's...happened to you?
What about you?
What did you want other than sex...
Is he gentle?
Tsuda, is he sweet with you?
Yes, he's always sweet with me.
Really?
Don't dare have sex with her!
Don't have sex with her!
He is sweet.
Don't you dare have sex!
Did you hear me? Don't have sex with her!
Say, Hizuru.
What you doing with him?
He's an idiot.
Hizuru! Listen to this.
I heard off someone today that he once...
Chickened out from a match.
He refused to get in the ring. How about that, eh?
How can the gym even keep him on,
a complete loser like that.
Hey, the owner has queer taste!
We're splitting up.
What did you say?
Let's split.
How dare you say something like that to me, bitch!
Please.
Go home. For your own good.
Go home!
Go home...
how dare she talk to me like that, the bitch!
Excuse me!
Say...
Have a boxing fight...
With me.
Go to sleep.
You're not scared, are you?
- Of what? - Of me.
Well then?
Get lost!
Fuck off! You're a freak!
- That's it. - Thanks.
- Kojima! - Yeah.
How about another match?
Great.
What do you want?
Why this air of menace?
You look threatening... 
but at least you're talking to me.
Stop! Where're you going?
To a hospital.
Skin from my hip can cover up your tattoo.
Thank you very much.
I can be cured by your hip...
I just don't get it.
What the hell?
I...was on my way home,
but the moon brought me back here.
When did he start boxing?
Say...
What's on your mind, him or your fight?
Are you in love with him?
I just wanted to see his face...
Crushed to pieces.
That is all.
It happened on a night like tonight. 
I saw her killed...
Tsuda and I were obsessed with
finding out who killed her.
But in the end, it was the police who found them.
Kojima! I gotta learn boxing...
I'd give them hell when they get out of prison.
Absolutely.
But, after high school, he forgot the whole thing.
He never took up boxing
and a few years later, became a bum.
He didn't see her dying after all...
But his face now,
it reminds me of his face back then.
Like a monster.
Don't you realize you're making him into a monster.
You'll be the first victim.
Forget him! I'll take his place!
His place?
You mean, you'll be my foe in the ring?
Since when did you have balls!?
You think you're a boxer...
But you're just a clown. Think you're a fighter?
Throwing yourself around the ring like a monkey...
Don't you realize? Everybody knows it but you!
A big joke who doesn't even know how to fight!
Hey? How about another match?
Yes.
Mr. Tsuda...
Please accept my condolences.
Your family's in the mortuary.
Mr. Tsuda...
You're father died in peace, 
without any suffering.
Hello...
Kojima?
Hizuru? Is that you, Hizuru?
Dad is gone.
Strange, I had a funny feeling...
We've just finished with everything.
The funeral, just now.
I'm scared...
I'm scared...scared of me.
Where are you now?
I want to see you.
What do you say?
I'll see you under the highway...
...Yeah?
Okay...in a moment.
I sent a guy over to your apartment...
Give a call to my fucking office, 
before I call the police.
Message No.32
Kumagaki? How strong is this guy?
The tattoos on his shoulder 
count the number of victories he's had.
- Will Aoki make it? - No problem.
A piece of cake.
Where the hell you been?
Aoki!
How is he?
Cut the bandage!
Go easy!
Hold on. You'll be all right...
Listen...
Let Hiruzu go, will you.
I'm scared to see her change and,
Moreover...
That I'll forget about her, too.
No way.
Don't you dare lift a finger on her.
If you do I'll...!
In this ring?
Kill me!
Come on in! I'm waiting!
You're next fight, it's with
Kumagaki.
It's an arranged match
but not fixed. You can still sink him, that is...
If you want to?
You'll be thirty soon.
You'll not get any younger!
Go for it!
We'll back you up.
Right, Hase?
Me? No.
You can count me out.
Well?
You wont fight, I know.
- Watch your mouth! - I'm sorry.
You're just a woman who belongs
in the kitchen!
A man needs his woman to cook for him.
Especially a champion of the ring.
What's with all the clothes, anyway?
Where's you're skin jewelry?
- Took them off. - Why?
Felt like it.
And the tattoo?
That doesn't come off easily...
It's not a problem.
I'll get a skin graft from my hip. 
All that'll remain after the operation
will be a tiny little scratch.
Are you...getting back with him?
Come on. Depending on your decision...
I might have to change  the menu tonight.
Hey, this isn't easy!
He may kill me.
I'm not forcing you to fight.
Just make up your mind!
You bitch, you don't know  nothing about it!
She wants to kill me.
No, I won't do it. No way!
Oh, Mr. Shirota, 
sorry to have to call you this late.
About the proposed match...
You've got a deal.
Kojima, no, no. You're too straight.
Stick you elbow in like this, once in a while.
Quit fishing!
Wanna try ring training? 
But don't hit him for real, okay?
He's your substitute...
Go easy!
Draw in your chin.
One round only, okay?
Kojima...!!
Hey! Tsuda! Stop it!
Stop, now! Give up scuffling!
Kojima, this is only the beginning!
Stop it! Boxing isn't scuffling!
Kojima, you listening?
You will die. You have no chance.
Kumagaki will take care of that.
And even if he fails,
I will do it.
Let Hizuru know this.
I'll even beat the shit out of the people you know, 
before I kill you.
Fine.
Was that him?
You're not... leaving me, are you?
What're you saying?
I've got to get a radish from the store.
You can't beat it away.
Hizuru...
What's Kojima to you?
I'm not bothered if he beats me to death.
Let's get going.
Hizuru...
The result of the medicine?
Come to think of it... 
I haven't felt tired since then.
I'm so...so scared.
Everybody's...gone...
Completely crazy.
Going back to him?
How about a spar? With a handicap.
Not you...
Fucking moron.
Get out of here, idiot!
You've got a match to fight soon!
Fantastic, Kojima! Keep it going!
Doing fine.
Get a doctor, he's still bleeding. 
Quickly!
Listen, Kojima.
Finish him, next round.
Get him. Kill him!
