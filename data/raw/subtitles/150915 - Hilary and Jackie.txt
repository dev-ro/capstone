Hello.
Yes. I'll get her.
Yes. I'll tell her.
All right. Bye.
I've got a message
for you.
A secret one.
When I was but 13 or so,
I went into a golden land.
Cimbarozo Cotopaxi
took me by the hand!
Over the Orinoco...
across the blazing
Kalahari desert...
through the untamed
grasslands of the veldt.
What is it?
What did she say?
What did
she say that for?
It's all right.
I don't mind.
Everything's going
to be all right.
Hils, wake up.
Mummy's made a new song
for us to play.
B-flat. Listen.
Big waves...
rolling in 3/4 time.
When you hear me change
to the major chord,
I want you to dive down
under the sea.
Dive down
under the waves.
You're just
silvery fishes
swimming in and out
of the seaweed
in 6/8 time.
And... watch out,
here comes the shark!
"Dear Mrs. Du Pré,
"we are planning
"to broadcast
a children's performance
"of the toy symphony by..."
Haydn.
Very good.
"We would be delighted
if you would conduct
"and if your daughter
Hilary
would agree to play
the flute part."
It's from the BBC.
Jolly good.
Jolly good.
Well done,
hullabaloo.
Ha ha.
What about me?
If you practice hard enough,
maybe next time.
But I want to come
this time.
I want to be
with Hilary.
Couldn't she just
come along for the ride?
It's an orchestra, Derek,
not a Clapham omnibus.
Jackie, that is quite
uncalled for!
You're spoiling
Hilary's special day.
If Jackie can't come,
I won't go.
Follow the score, girl.
Don't gawp at the soloist.
I really can't
apologize enough.
Oh, not at all.
Worth any amount
of trouble
to get
young Hilary.
She's really
very special.
Yes, I realize that.
Your sister's
a remarkable girl.
You must be
very proud.
Oh, we all are.
Terribly proud.
Good-bye.
I am never going to go through
anything like that again.
If you want to be with Hilary,
you have to play as well as her.
If you want
to be together,
you've got to be
equally good.
Do you understand?
Yes.
So I should think
we should leave some
money on the doorstep
for the burglar to take
so he wouldn't get in
anymore.
What do you think?
well, I think...
And the first prize
goes to the Du Pré sisters,
Jacqueline and Hilary.
Well done!
One for you.
One for you.
Shall I take that
for you?
In the woodwind category...
a very clear winner...
with the highest number
of points ever awarded
in this section
at this festival...
Hilary Du Pré.
Come along.
We had no difficulty at all
in choosing the winner
in the string section,
even though we were
a little unnerved
by the candidate's rather...
overemphatic
bodily movements.
I think this must be
the first time
that our winning soloists
have been sisters.
The judges were unanimous
in choosing
miss Jacqueline Du Pré.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have many more awards,
so I beg for you all
to sit down just...
She does move about
a bit.
She looks like one of
these Bobby Soxer types.
I must say that's my fault.
They did a lot of music
and movement
when they were younger.
Excuse me. Can I have
a picture, please?
Yeah, you, too, sir.
That's lovely. Yeah.
Nice big smiles.
Hils! Hils!
Come over.
Is this one of yours?
Does she play?
Oh, yes.
Hilary won as well,
didn't you, dear?
We can have
a family portrait.
Right.
Could you hold your flute
up where I can see it?
Smile then.
Your sister's
a remarkable girl.
You must be very proud.
Oh, yes, we are.
Terribly proud.
Smile then!
Well, then...
be good.
We'll collect you
in an hour.
Be good.
Yes.
Now...
let's see
what you can do.
An hour today,
and then
see how it goes.
Oh.
There.
Well, now,
this is nice.
No.
Try that... that lifting,
that upbeat
before the 3 quavers
with an up bow.
Like... like so.
I like him.
He's my cello daddy.
I want to come every day.
Can I come every day?
Do you mind?
We shall have
to get a car.
Oh.
That's it.
She's ready.
Mrs. Du Pré,
what do you think
of a debut recital
at the Wigmore Hall?
Marvelous.
I've spoken
to Ibbs and Tillet...
they'll handle the publicity
and the tickets...
and to Ernest Lush.
He'll accompany her
on the piano.
Oh.
She's playing flat.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm afraid that my "a" string
has come loose,
and I'm going to have
to restring my cello
and start again.
Well, at least
it wasn't my "g" string.
I do wish she'd keep
that head still.
Looks so flamboyant,
all that hair flying
about the place.
Oh. There she is.
They want me to play
at a wedding in Italy.
It's a princess' wedding.
You will come, won't you?
I'd be terrified alone.
Congratulations.
You were wonderful.
Oh, thank you.
Um, excuse me, everyone.
Attention, please.
Thank you.
Jackie's debut
went very well.
I'm sure you would agree.
And to mark the occasion,
a very generous friend
who wishes
to remain anonymous...
has offered her this.
It's one of the finest
cellos ever made.
It's called the Davidov.
The magic
is in the varnish.
So you must
keep it away
from the extremes
of temperature.
Another problem
is the insurance.
So don't let it
get out of your sight.
It will give you
the world, Jackie.
You must give it
yourself.
Fratello Othello.
Spaghetti.
Spaghetti.
Spaghetti Fra Gola.
Si. Fra Gola.
Si?
Si.
Uffici de ponte.
Ah.
Uffici de Firenze.
Firenze?
Capri.
Ah, Capri
bellisimo.
Si, bellisimo!
Si, bellisimo!
Si, fortesimo!
Shh. Shh.
The bubbles are so...
Ok.
Here's to Hilary and Jackie
and all who've seen enough.
Mmm.
Hils, look.
Wow.
We're in heaven.
Oh, put that
bloody light out.
Excuse me.
Have you seen
my sister?
Is your sister
Jacqueline Du Pré?
Yes.
She'll be in Berlin
by now.
She's playing the Haydn
cello concerto in c.
Oh.
You going back
to London?
Yes. I suppose so.
Oh. Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.
What is this blasted
jigging about?
Stand still, girl.
Stand still.
It is impossible
to produce a proper tone
without proper
deportment.
You have no technique.
That's all right.
Technique can be taught.
We just have to go back
to the beginning
and start again.
Cancel any concert dates
you may have outstanding.
Yes, Mr. Bentley.
Oh, Hilary...
how is your
marvelous sister?
I'm not sure.
She's away at the moment.
In Russia.
Oh.
That's it,
old boy...
keep trying.
That's it!
Ooh.
I felt that.
Listen.
Well done, boy.
What is it?
That is radio Moscow.
This is what Jackie
will be hearing
if she's listening
to the wireless.
No.
No.
No!
No!
No!
Instead of rehearsing
this piece,
I just want you
to practice playing
b-flat.
Just the note b-flat?
The note.
Just the note.
Thanks.
Parcel from Jacks,
everybody!
Want help?
Well, open it!
Can't open it.
Hils...
can't break it.
Here, Hil.
Let me.
It's her washing.
I suppose
it must be difficult
getting her washing done
in a foreign country.
Good afternoon,
ma'am.
My niece
is a student.
Embouchure.
Embouchure.
Miss Du Pré.
Yes?
I was wondering, could I
book you for a concert?
No, it's not me you want.
It's my sister.
But you're
Hilary Du Pré...
the flautist?
Yes.
Yes, it's you I want.
The Bach b-minor.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not allowed
to play concerts
until
after my exam.
Oh. Well,
when's your exam?
Right now,
as a matter of fact.
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll wait.
Please.
Good.
Good.
Good.
Would you like to try
that for us again,
please, Hilary?
Again.
Again.
Miss Du Pré.
Look, do I get my booking?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You ran off.
I followed you home.
Oh.
You don't mind,
do you?
No...
as a matter of fact.
I'd ask you in, but, um...
it's a bit awkward.
My sister's just come home.
All right.
Best go in.
What do you think
you're doing?
Well, if you're not going
to invite me to tea,
I shall just have to make
a nuisance of myself.
You c...
Do you know...
I'm starving.
Ooh.
Come here.
Ohh!
Hello.
Who's this?
Kiffer Finzi.
I'm in love
with Hilary.
And you're
Hilary's sister.
What do you do?
I'm a musician.
Oh, following in Hils'
footsteps, are you?
Are you any good?
Hello!
Kiffer Finzi. Very
pleased to meet you.
You don't mind
if I start, do you?
Exams really do give
you an appetite.
Your exam!
How did it go?
Oh.
Famously. She's been offered
professional bookings.
5 quid to do the Bach b-minor
next week in Newbury.
Isn't that right?
Yeah.
You must be very proud of her.
Yes, I am.
Mmm. These are delicious.
Absolutely throwing it
there outside.
I got soaked.
Shall I be mum?
Oh, a nice cup of tea.
I just screamed.
It was so embarrassing.
So, have you
been with him?
No.
Of course not.
No.
Why? Have you been
with somebody?
I'm thinking my answer,
and you're going to have
to read my mind.
All right.
Oh, my lord, you have.
You study in scarlet!
What about you,
Hils?
Been with anyone?
Now you'll have
to read my mind.
Oh, poor Hils.
Maybe one day.
Then again, maybe not.
"Hilary Du Pré is a flautist
of immense expressive
"as well as technical ability.
She obviously has
a great future ahead of her."
Does it mention
Jackie?
Why? She wasn't playing.
I wonder if I might ask you
to keep your voice down.
Jackie's asleep.
What, she's here?
Yes. You've met.
She should get up,
read the review!
No, you mustn't wake her.
Kiffer.
Where's he going?
Come on!
Up, out of that bed!
Your friend is making
rather a lot of noise.
Up, up!
Look. Read.
Oh, we're off
to the pictures.
Can I come?
No, you can't come.
It's a date.
We're going to see
Jules et Jim.
Sounds French.
Where's it playing?
In France.
It's by François Truffaut.
It's playing at the Scala
on Wardour street.
That's in Soho.
Yes. I thought we could
go to Maison Bertaux,
seeing as we're
in a French mood.
You do realize there
are white slavers
working
in that area?
Hmm?
No self-respecting man
would ask a woman
to go to such a place.
It's out
of the question.
I'm sorry.
It's completely
out of the question.
Well...
no chance of a lift, then?
Come on.
Jacks.
Jacks.
Kiffer's asked me
to marry him.
What?
Kiffer's asked me
to marry him.
Well, what do you think?
Well, that's just silly.
Look, Hils. You don't
have to marry him.
Do you know
what that is?
That, my dear,
is a Dutch cap.
It's a contraceptive.
Is it really?
Hmm.
Where did you get it?
Doc fitted me up.
Oh, come on, Hils.
Let's get a flat
together and go bonkers.
We could have all
the men we wanted to.
I'm going to Marry Kiffer.
I love him.
He loves me.
He does not love you.
He just wants to get
into your knickers.
You don't have
to get married
every time
you fancy a screw.
That's what these
are for.
I want to get married.
Well,
you can't marry him.
You can't just leave me.
I'm not leaving you.
You're not here anymore.
You never will be again.
Haven't you heard?
I'm giving up the cello.
Oh, don't be silly.
I can do what I want.
But you don't know anything
apart from the cello.
I don't know anything
apart from the flute.
We're babies, Jacks.
Kiffer laughs at me.
Then why are you
marrying him?
Because he makes me
feel special.
That's a big swizz,
because the truth is...
you're not special.
I thought you'd be
happy for me.
This is nice.
Hi.
What on earth
are you wearing?
It's fab, isn't it?
Danny bought it for me.
This is Danny,
by the way.
Danny,
this is daddy.
Daddy-o.
Barenboim.
I thought he was
from Argentina.
Surely that must be
a German name.
I think it must
be Jewish.
Oh.
Oh, dear.
I had a large breakfast
this morning.
He's a pig.
I have got plenty more.
Piers, dig in.
Anyway, mummy,
we're really desperate
to get married,
but lord knows when
we'll have the time.
Of course. It's best not
to rush these things.
I'm completely
booked up until may.
And Danny's
booked up...
June.
He's such a show-off,
but he's very handsome.
Of course, we only
really meet in airports.
We're going to do more
joint bookings together.
Sort of a duo,
like the Beatles.
There are 4 Beatles,
actually.
Anyway, when we do
get married,
we're going
to get married
somewhere
wildly romantic
like the wailing wall
in Jerusalem.
Don't you have to be Jewish
to be married there?
Yes, that's right.
I'm going to be Jewish.
I'm having lessons
already.
Instruction, not lessons.
Oh.
So, what do you think?
Why are you talking funny?
Am I?
Nobody becomes Jewish.
I know for a fact you can't
just convert to Judaism.
Bye-bye now.
Leave it to me.
Honestly,
I can sort it out.
Oh, uh...
She can't possibly be
Jewish, for god's sake.
She's blond.
They call them
the Arthur and Guinevere
of music's Camelot.
The blossoming romance
between Jacqueline Du Pré
and the Argentinean pianist
Daniel Barenboim
has taken the world
by storm.
Up a bit higher.
That's it.
Oh, I can see them now.
Miss Du Pré astonished
the British public
with her brilliant rendition
of Elgar's cello concerto.
Piers!
Fresh from a triumphant
series...
You've ruined it now.
The couple has just
announced their engagement.
Miss Du Pré is converting
to Judaism.
And they plan to wed
in Barenboim's adopted
home of Israel
in the golden city
of Jerusalem.
Both asleep.
Coming.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Aah!
Oh, they're freezing!
Cold fingers are
very stimulating.
No, they're
bloody well not.
Shh.
What?
Oh, ok.
Here we go.
Mind your head.
Your nose is cold, too!
Someone's coming.
They can't be.
Well, they are, you know.
Jackie.
Oh, darling.
Why didn't you tell us?
Do I have to walk
all the way down there?
Come on.
Ok, yes, please.
So, Hilary, listen.
Oh, no, I've forgotten
it now. Shit.
How does it go?
Oh, I know this,
I know this.
Oh, yes.
Dvorak.
Yes.
Absolutely.
You two are telepathic.
It's true.
It's true.
Oh, rubbish.
Do another one.
All right.
Ok.
You listening?
I know this. This
is dies Natalis
by Kiffer's father.
All right, go on.
Do another one.
Ok, um...
don't tap it.
Just think it.
Ok.
All right.
You really got me
by the kinks.
Absolutely.
You're just
saying that.
No, it's true.
We always know what
the other one is thinking.
You know what
I'm thinking now,
don't you, sis?
Not really.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
I'll tell you.
No.
I mean, just tell me.
I want
to sleep with Kiffer.
You don't mind,
do you, sis?
We always did say
that we'd share
everything, remember?
What?
What is it?
Nothing. I think
we should all go to bed.
I don't want
to go to bed.
I could stay up
all night.
Well, you have
to be very careful,
'cause it's very easy to
stand on one, isn't it?
Why don't you look
around there?
I think you might be
standing on one.
I'm just going over
to the Williams' place
for cheese, luv.
I'll come with you.
I thought you had jet lag.
The walk will help.
Why don't you two
go together,
and I can get on
with the gutters?
Fine.
Actually I'd just
as soon stay here.
Me, too.
It's settled, then.
Kiffer goes off
for the cheese
and we stay here.
I'll get the fucking
cheese, all right?
I think you should
go with her.
Why?
'Cause she doesn't
know the way.
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie!
Jackie.
Get away from me!
You don't love me!
Don't fucking love me!
All I want is a fuck.
Jackie.
Aah!
Come on.
All I want is a fucking fuck,
for fuck's sake!
It's ok.
Ohh!
It's all right.
No.
We have to.
No, we don't have to.
Why would anyone have to?
Because she's my sister.
Yes, well,
I think you'll find
that this is not
the sort of thing
that sisters normally
ask one another.
Because I'm scared.
Yes, well,
she doesn't scare me.
I'm sure it would
just be the once.
Just the once, huh?
I wouldn't have asked.
Any particular position?
She just needs proof.
Proof of what,
for god's sake?
Proof that
somebody loves her.
She just went.
Didn't say a word.
Didn't...
cancel
her engagements.
How does she
seem to you?
Well, she has been acting
a little oddly.
It's beautiful.
I can see why
you wanted to come here
instead of Los Angeles.
Don't worry about
the cancellations, by the way.
I've seen to them.
Everyone was
very understanding.
No one wants to put
pressure on you,
so don't worry.
So...
Which is the daddy?
Which one?
There's a slate mine
on the other side
of the mountain.
Kiffer,
look what Theresa's found.
Will you excuse me
a moment?
Is that the one
with that one?
I was thinking...
if Kiffer and Hilary
can do it, so can we.
We can buy a house
near here if you like.
It would cost
next to nothing.
We could have all we needed.
We could have a little studio,
rehearsal rooms,
phones.
We could have a helipad.
What do you say?
Pbltlllt!
I try to give her
everything she wants.
I don't know
what she wants.
Do you know
what she wants?
Not really.
Look after her,
won't you, Kiffer?
That's better.
It's just us again.
You know you
can't have toast.
I don't know why
you keep asking.
Daddy, I want toast.
Toast?
Toast? I want
toast, too.
Could we
have toast?
I haven't had a chance
to light the fire yet.
Well, we'll light
the fire, won't we?
Let's light the fire.
Yes.
There.
Take some of these
and put them
on the fire.
I feel a million dollars
this morning.
That was exactly what
the doctor ordered.
Oh, thank you, Hils.
You don't mind, do you?
No, of course not.
Well, here we all are.
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could stay
like this forever?
Get this one.
You get that one.
Come on. Throw some more
logs on the fire.
