What have you done?
Why did you broke it?
I didn't pay it's money yet,
have you gone mad?
Not me but you are gone mad,
but i don't need it all.
I don't like girls in shalwar kameez.
When we met in the beginning,
what do you think if you will wear
bikini so you are british,
you are on air on tv.
Move!
Once again re take.
It's private party tonight

Is everything alright?
That pyari!
No she is not,
you are joking with me,

This time it's confirmed,
she is saying that guys like me came
to london to earn pounds,
and they are still desi from inside,
when did it happened?
15 minutes back,
it happens,
have fun!
It's enough,
it's marriage not a game,
i know!
But where is the bride?
That's why i called you up.
You know that my track record is
bad about girls.
I always put my hand on
wrong girl.
I am not gonna marry with
any british girl.
That's why i got a job for you,
what?
Just because of break-up...
i am fed up with my bachelor life.
I thought i will marry with pyari,
it's not possible now.
Go to mom and dad,
and find a nice girl along with them,
they are little bit old school but
you are like me,
we both liked madhuri dixit.
I am sure the girl you will choose,
i will must like that girl as well.
Take a break, girls are not
hanging up on trees.
Don't worry i will do something,
whose phone call was that?
Bhai sahab.
Tell me one thing what kind of
name is that bhai sahab,
my name is police kush,
what's your name?
My name?
My name is bhai sahab.
Girl for bhai sahab,
i will must have to do it,
i will find a bride for my brother,
listen! Call me.
How are you?
Here comes my son,
you are gone so weak,
look! You are the mother of upcoming
biggest director of bollywood,
how many were they?
Where is dad?
He is waiting for you,
you will tell him or i should tell.
He just came here.
I am fed up with you and
your generation,
he was saying since many years that...
i will marry with british girl.
But yesterday he told me on phone
that no...
i will marry with an indian girl.
And you won't find that girl for me,
but my brother will find,
dad has made few proposals line up.
When?
Tomorrow!
How much pounds your brother earns,
my daughter studied in dehli college,
we raised her with love,
i have heard that amitabh's
height is 7.5.
Will you make me heroine?
What happened to people?
You have made few movies you forgot
your own reality,
it happens in real life,
middle class man talk like that he asks
these questions,
so what should i do? Shall i tell my
brother i can't find a girl.
There must be some technique so i
could find a girl.
Who would adjust in london
with my brother,
i am rakhi sawant speaking,
i saw your add.
That's cute.
Send it to my show,
idea was good.
So many calls are coming and my
house has become a call centre,
you know how many days are
left for christmas,
if this marriage won't be fixed
in 10-15 days...
then bhai sahab and dad will kill me,
phone call for you!
He is saying that he is calling
from ministry,
i called you up because i saw your
metrimonial add.
If you have no objection then...
what happen?
She is my mom,
greetings!
I hope you don't have any problem
to find our house.
And he is my genius son ajay,
nice to meet you.
Groom is in london from 8 years,
yeah!
He wants to settle down there,
i don't think he would adjust in
life style of india.
He will come to india for marriage,
he is thinking right,
if he likes london so he should
stay there.
In fact i also london i have been
there since 18 years,
i was cultural secretary there,
and my daughter born there,
that's the main reason that i
wanted to meet you,
when i saw your add...
what have you done?
Are you okay?
He messed up all...
if any boy flerts with many girls
at same time,
then it's fine,
he is a stud.
And if it's a girl like me,
then they do think she will sleep
with anyone,
i am suffocating here,
it's india not london,
every country have a culture,
mostly girls of here not friendly
and straight forward like you,
they have some respect,
it doesn't mean that you are wrong,
you are right on your place,
if you will act like this in
this country,
then you will find a guy like him
on every crossing,
who said to see every girl wearing
mini skirt that she will be appeased,
not at all.
What you are that's perfect,
that's your best thing,
that you are so clean and you can't
see the dirt around you,
if there is a matter of people's mind,
that will be change with time,
it will take some time,
want some tea with me?
Some other day,
so soon?
What happen to you?
You have changed,
i can't believe that you are doing
arrange marriage,
everything changes with time,
and i have done all madness what
i wanted to do.
And my parents never stopped me,
i did parties like crazy.
And i never broke their trust,
now i am 27.
And you know when some girl cross
25 in this country,
so the neighbours makes stories.
I just born in london but my
heart is indian,
you are such a deep girl.
And by the way i think that arrange
marriage would be an adventure.
And all those boyfriends?
I got break-up will all of them,
they all were dumb,
i want to get marry with some
rich package,
your brother is a package,
yes!
I born in london,
i have accent,
he lives in london,
i will be mix up there.
He earns good pounds,
so i will spend them,
and think our white kids will call you
uncle in accent,
your brother don't have girlfriends,
he have but he just broke up.
You speak good dialogues,
you should be in movies.
Now let's go outside otherwise people
will think there is some problem,
what's the matter?
You took so long,
it was gone so deep.
It seems that he peed in
his pents.
Divya! Take kush inside,
did you call me?
We have seen few card samples and
we like most of them,
you go with dimple and select
your design,
and if you are free then shall we
go now? Why not?
You go ahead!
We will follow you in car.
Let's do one thing,

Don't move.
You don't know how to drive?
You don't know how to drive scooter?
Have you gone mad?

You will surely get married?
Yeah!
Your son has come so you forgot us,

You are feeling love for your friend,

I am very confused.
I am feeling strange since yesterday.
I am thinking about you everytime
when you were gone with bhai sahab.
It's getting complicated.
When i told you something is missing
so i was missing you,
what's my mistake?
I didn't think and fell in love.
Now what we will do about that?
Let me think,
there is only one way left.
Why are you crying?
I was scared.
Please try to understand me.
We can't elope.
But why? Because i'm not amir khan
and you're not juhi chawla.
What did you think? We will build our
house on mountain,
i will work in factory and you will
bring lunch for everyday.
Love happened.
This situation is very complicated.
You are my brother's fiancee.
Marriage is cancelled.

Tell me are you ready for marriage?
I am gone flat.
I ditched on her attitude.
Now there is not pyari,
now it's only dimple.
You missed her sometime.
I missed her alot.
We had 5 years relationship.
She still lives some corner
of my heart.
Don't ask me we were so close...
...to get married.
We both have our future kids name
admitted in schools.
I became sentimental when
i am drunk.
Now everything is over.
Do piya must have forgot you.
She still loves me.
Since the day we broke up.
She calls me everyday.
I still have her message in my phone.
Look at her sms.
She will be angry.
Dimple never hide anything from me,
you have written movie story
in real life.
If bhai sahab will know then
we all will be doomed.
Nobody else should know about this.
You are different from him,
how?
And look at your brother he is so
boring, he is like this since childhood
is it your phone?
Yes, it's mine.
Does it have games.
Yes!
Do you know my life was about to ruin
just because of you.
I am saved now.
I have read your sms on
love's mobile.
And my eyes were opened.
But he told me that he don't
love me anymore.
He turned his condition very bad to
forget you.
How could i get marry to a lover
who loved you alot.
Why don't you break that marriage?
This is india,
if my marriage will broken
after engagement,
only me and my family will be defamed
that's why i called you here.
Because only you can help me,
how?
First you tell me.
Do you love him?
Alot!
Will you marry him?
Yes!
But he is getting marry with you.
You don't know...
guys are fools.
Just show lollipop to fool.
Remember one thing you are my
friend from london,
she is my friend from london,
i have come in her wedding,
what kind of clothes you
are wearing,
we have already broke up?
Three days back you were sending
me messages.
Did you reply those messages?
Now there is nothing between
me and you.
What are you doing here?
What was happening here?
Last night priya was saying that
she loves bedminton,
she is from london,
she is a nice girl.
May i tell you one thing,
you meet me after so long,
something's happening in
my heart.
I really like riya.
How do you like that girl?
I think she is good for kush.
What do you think shall
we talk to her family,
if kush likes her then why not?
Let's ask him right now.
How is she?
Who?
Piya!
Very nice.
Did you like her?
Shall we fix your marriage with her.
Something stucked?
I was saying that...
let's meet at 5.
First time you came on time
for date.
It's not a time forjoke.
What are you doing?
You are flerting with my younger
brother, he is just a kid.
Your brother wears diapers.
Problem is that my mom is about to
fix his marriage with you.
That's nice i also want to
get married.
May i tell you one thing his many
habits are familiar to you.
It's not possible.
Why not?
Because you are my...
whatever happened...
it's all happened because of my and
piya's breakup.
I was not ready for this marriage,
you and mom are greater for me
from anyone in this world.
But i made a big mistake.
I can't marry with dimple.
Because i am in love with piya.
Piya also love me alot.
So much love that i want to live my
seven lives with her,
that's why me and piya got married,
photos are in envelope,
please forgive me,
give me your blessings.
What happen?
Now what will happen?
It's done what it has to be,
both families will be defamed,
but we have to think how to
come out from this mess.
You are not trying to understand,
all guests have arrived,
tomorrow is marriage.
Now how would i bring
another love.
I am saying that get dimple's
married with kush.
He is right.
We like kush if you appease him
for marriage,
then we both will be save
from defame.
Will you get marry or?
Kush is a nice guy.
And he will keep you happy.
For us.
He want to talk to dimple alone,
dimple exactly wanted the same,
till let's sit over there.
Now they both say yes.
Then we will be save from defame.
Otherwise love didn't left
us for anything,
but it was not my son's fault.
What that piya has done,
what about that?
I am not gonna propose you,
then forget the marriage.
Come on!
What do you want?
I should sit on my knees and
ask you
will you marry me?
Piya was a poor girl.
Poor girl?
Love's character is lil bit loose.
What did you say?
My son's character is loose.
And what about your daughter's
friend piya.
She was saint.
Say that you are the prettiest
girl of the world.
I will always keep you happy.
Is this a proposal?
I will never burp in front of you.
Like you are defending that girl i am
doubting on your family.
Don't talk about my family.
We are listening it doesn't mean
that you will say anything,
there is nothing left to say,
everything is on your front.
You have insulted us.
It's enough.
Get ready to elope.
If you love dimple then elope her.
I can't...
i will slap on your face so you will
forget your dialogues.
It's a matter of my life.
Please! Listen to me for last time,
if this won't work then i will do
whatever you will say.
Only one car should left in last.
That's the last car.
I think everyone has gone.
We will have to take this car.
We will miss our train,
you go!
I will drive the car.
