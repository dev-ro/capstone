Don't treat me
like I'm stupid, Bob.
That's all I ask. Ok? Please.
You're really something.
You're really something.
You're home getting
dressed for 2 hours.
You don't say a goddamn word.
We get into the restaurant,
and out of nowhere...
So, what are you saying,
you weren't with this woman?
Yes, I was.
I was having lunch. So what?
But Teddy didn't see you
with your arm around her?
Don't interrogate me,
Judith, or I swear to god...
Teddy said he saw you
with your arm around her.
He said you were just about
to leave when he spotted you.
Look, I'm not an idiot,
all right?
I know it must have
looked a little strange
with me here with some woman,
close friend of mine sees me.
Even though it was innocent,
I act as if it wasn't,
so I say some stupid little
thing out of nervousness.
No, no. You weren't nervous.
You stood there and told
the joke about the 3 doctors.
So, what is that, our joke?
Fuck you.
Let's stop it, all right?
Don't act like I'm nuts.
You stood there and told a joke
that takes at least 2 minutes.
You have to do the pediatrician,
the psychiatrist, the accents.
All right, you win.
It's so important
for you to win.
No, my point is you stood there
and told a joke with accents
to my best friend's husband
with this woman hanging on you,
and he laughed and she laughed,
and you just loved it.
You weren't nervous, Bob.
Just don't treat me
like I'm crazy.
I don't know what I did wrong.
What did I do wrong?
I told a joke.
I had lunch
with a female colleague.
She's a doctor?
Yes. Pediatrics.
Then why did I have
to find out from Ann?
Why didn't you tell me?
That's all I'm saying.
That's not all you're saying.
What do you think,
I'm gonna be crushed, Bob?
Like after almost 20 years
I don't know you?
You loved that Teddy saw you.
You loved him thinking
something was going on
with some some 30
she's 34.
Hi. Hi.
A subcommittee
to investigate the likelihood
of terrorist attacks
on American soil
in the coming century.
A rise in the number of infants
born addicted
to crack and cocaine
has one community outraged
over what they feel
is the city's lack of commitment
to reduce drug-trafficking
and to provide funds for
the care of these children,
often abandoned...
Awful, awful.
What do they expect me to do
with all this information?
What am I supposed to do
about crack babies?
Terrorists. I can't stand
those terrorists.
They're so mad at everybody.
I wish they'd just get over it.
Maybe I should adopt
a crack baby,
send it to a good school,
give it a chance.
Shut up. I'm gonna raise
an inner-city child
in this building?
Can't stand the people
in this building
with their jeeps
and their loafers.
And mean, stuck-up
private school kids
would make fun of my crack baby.
My crack baby would have
no play dates. Poor kid.
Awful. What do they expect me
to do with all this information?
What am I supposed to do
with all this information?
Awful, awful, awful.
Excuse me. Are
is everything all right?
I was...
You ok? Here. Here's a...
Want a handkerchief?
Thank you.
Yeah.
Thank you.
That's very nice of you.
It's a very gentlemanly
thing to do.
I just see you here.
It's a nice day.
It's beautiful.
Verrazano bridge.
It's gorgeous.
The moon is out.
Ain't this some
beautiful picture?
Ain't this charming over here?
Romeo and Juliet!
Wait.
Don't say a fuckin' thing to me!
Fuck you!
Fuck me?
This man is a gentleman!
Unlike you!
He is nothing!
He's a piece of shit!
Ok. I'm gonna go.
I got to live my own life!
You cocksucker!
I will do whatever
the fuck I want to!
Go ahead! Hit me!
Why you always
keeping me waiting?
Hey, Stevie.
You got a thing about
keeping me waiting?
Vic, please,
I already got a wife.
Get off my ass.
Where's the rest?
I got caught
a little short this week.
You're gambling.
You're betting again?
No. No, I'm not gambling.
Hey, if santi finds out
you're fooling around
with his money...
The social security number
was screwed up on my paycheck.
What do you want me to do,
manufacture money, Vic?
Look, santi wants the money
paid in full on time.
You got the rest of
the afternoon. That's it.
I got a double shift today.
I'm gonna go to work at 4:00.
I'm not gonna be able
to make it today.
Good. Get it to me by 4:00.
Say hello to your brother
for me, will you?
Excuse me.
Are you the nurse
for the francada girl?
Yes, I am.
I'm her father.
I was wondering
if you could fill me in
on what's going on.
Does this mean that she's
not in remission anymore?
Well, your wife
has all that information,
and she's in the room
if you'd like to stop by
and have a word with her.
No.
If you could just
take some extra care...
I know you've got
a lot of patients,
you got a lot of people
to take care of.
If you could just give her
a little extra care,
I'd appreciate it.
We're gonna do that anyway.
We really will.
Now you put that away.
Ok. All right.
Put it away.
Ok.
If you want to go
to her room now, you can.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
You've aggravated me so much,
I can't even swallow.
You know what, ma?
I can't take this shit no more.
Well, then go. My life is over.
I've got no life.
Don't do me any favors.
No life, ma! Did you hear me?
I won't be here much longer.
I'll be dead soon.
Yeah I want a date.
I wanna make reservations
for club med.
You see how she talks to me?
Bury me now. Don't wait.
I'll die later.
I don't want to waste
anybody's time.
By the way, Judith, she don't
want you here no more.
She don't want a nurse,
she don't want
to go into a home.
She just wants me to take care
of her 24 hours a day and work
while my goddamn sisters
sit on their big, fat asses
and do nothing.
They have their own lives!
See did you hear that?
And I got nothin'.
I am so stressed.
Donna, go to work, please.
All right.
I raised 3 daughters.
I had a no-good,
worthless husband,
didn't give me one day of peace.
Did I complain?
Every day of my fuckin' life.
You see that mouth?
You hear that mouth?
Dear god, take me.
You mind if I ask you?
You're divorced, right?
You got any kind of life?
Any children?
No.
How long were you married?
16 years.
What, you couldn't get caught?
We didn't want any.
Sweetheart,
I got to be honest.
Maybe it's me.
Maybe I'm too selfish.
Maybe I don't love kids enough.
I know that sounds... Awful.
I just... I just don't
want to. I'm sorry.
If that's how you feel,
it's not your fault.
It's just...
I mean...
What are we gonna do
with all this space?
What? Only people with kids
can have country houses?
Judith, listen to me.
I love our life, I really do.
We can... We can
do whatever we want.
We have money. We can travel.
Not everybody has to have kids
to have a good life.
There aren't many things
in this life
can ruin a woman.
We're very strong
creatures god made,
but men, men
could do it every time.
There's a deuce.
What the hell are
you still here for?
Here's a whore.
2 pair, possible full house.
As usual.
There's a flush.
Possible full bets. Pat's bet.
Let's make it interesting.
What are you,
a fucking communist?
20?
All right, I call.
I'm in.
Straight. To the 9.
Looks like a winner.
Here we go, straight
to the toilet.
What do you got?
Full boat.
Jesus Christ!
Where did you get that ass?
Let me see that big ass.
What do you do?
I read the signs, my friend.
What's the saying,
"unlucky in love,
lucky in poker"?
If the gods want me to win,
I must oblige.
Hey, pattie, read
my ass, all right?
All right, ante up. My deal.
You got to lose sometimes.
This is my last one.
I got to be at work at 4:00.
You working?
Yeah. Just until
my inheritance kicks in.
Where you living now, pattie?
With my brother.
Ho ho ho.
Wife throws him out
after 25 years.
You believe that?
You mean to tell me
she didn't know he was
a piece of shit after 10?
That's tough.
Thanks for bringing
that up, sid.
You gotta shit
on my winning streak.
That's terrible.
Hey, next thing we hear,
you're gonna tell us
you're working for your brother.
Now, I'm really
getting the horns.
Your brother makes
a nice dollar, pat.
What good's making a good dollar
if you don't
do anything with it?
I watched that place
run my mother and father
into the ground.
It's doing the same thing
to my brother Philly.
It's not gonna do that
to me. I'm not a bartender.
He makes a good dollar.
I... yes, I know.
How's your daughter?
Still in that school?
Yeah. Lisa's doing good.
She's terrific.
Are you loving that book?
I am. I've never
read her before.
Well, I think that's her best.
It's so beautiful and tragic.
I love the character.
I love the name. Lily Bart.
It's just devastating
what happens, though.
Are you at the riviera yet?
Just wait.
Can I skip to it now?
No. Be good.
Enjoy.
So he says...
Come on.
So he says...
You're right. You're right.
You're right.
You have to
do the pediatrician,
the psychiatrist, the accents.
You have to do the pediatrician,
the psychiatrist, the accents.
I told a joke.
What is she, 30? Some 30
what is she, 30? Some 30
she's 34.
If it's so innocent,
why didn't you tell me?
If it's so innocent,
why didn't you tell me?
I'm not mad or anything.
I just want to know the truth.
It's very simple.
Now you told me.
I understand. It's over.
Let's not drag this on
forever, ok?
That's all I'm saying.
I'm not mad or anything.
Now you told me,
and I understand.
Why didn't you tell me?
That's all I'm saying.
But how can I when
I haven't got the money?
You're a liar!
Get out of here!
Merchant beach, Florida,
was the hardest hit
by hurricane Ross.
The property damage is estimated
to exceed $370 million.
Roman catholics are protesting
a recent article
in an independent newsletter
called sanity,
distributed on college campuses
across the country.
The article lists
what sanity editors term
"assaults on humanity"
supported by
the Roman catholic church,
as well as the inability of
church leaders to admit guilt.
It was all to point out
the many apologies made
by either the pope or the church
between 1992 and 1997,
asking why it took 450 years
for the church to express guilt
over condoning...
And 2,000 years
to express regret
over the church's stance
against women's rights.
In local news,
an upper eastside woman plunged
to her death this evening
after having dinner
at la goulue.
Judith Moore, former wife
of Dr. Robert Nelson,
a renowned cardiologist
at New York hospital,
drank a Martini
with 2 ibuprofen tablets,
wrapped a colored banner
around her neck,
and jumped out the window
7 floors above fifth Avenue.
In a bizarre twist of events,
her body fell
on her former husband
and his new wife
as they were walking home
from a benefit
at the metropolitan
museum of art.
All 3 were killed.
The day in sports and a look
at wall street coming up...
She's not coming up
with us, is she?
We had lunch.
She's dropping me off.
Is that all right with you?
Bob, please.
I'm actually glad this happened.
I just want to say
one thing before I leave.
I know this is painful, and...
I'm very sorry
for how this happened.
It was never my intention
to break up a home.
I'm not that kind of person.
I come from a good solid family.
My parents have been
together 37 years.
I would never intentionally hurt
or destroy
another person's life.
Wow. You sound great.
Can I fuck you?
A hospital spokesperson said
doctors are confident the child
will make a full recovery.
Police, currently investigating,
see little hope of
identifying the child...
You slut.
Since the location suggests...
What's wrong with you?
Are you nuts?
Remember looking
for Mr. Goodbar?
Co-op boards across the city
are voting for an increase
in maintenance fees
and stricter
financial requirements
for potential tenants.
More on that story
when we return.
If they raise
the maintenance, I'm dead.
I'll have to move.
God, where would I go?
I can't live on the outskirts
of Manhattan at my age.
What if I wind up in queens?
Alone and wrinkled in queens.
What if I can't work?
What if I'm in a cab
and a suicidal terrorist driver
detonates himself
in front of Bergdorf's
to protest shopping...
And Satan, and I'm paralyzed.
I'll have to go to
one of those shelters.
I'll be sitting
in one of those cots
with my wheelchair
and all my luggage.
I wonder if you can
bring luggage to shelters.
I wonder if people who go
to shelters have luggage.
It's ridiculous what
you have to go through.
Interviews for a 5
reference letters?
Yeah, but if she
gets in, it'll be worth it.
Susan says, academically,
it is the best lower school.
Susan says.
I am so sick of people
having opinions.
I wish everyone
would just shut up.
Rita.
Look. Look who's here.
How are you?
Scotch, Barry.
You were great.
Well, thank you.
Look a little sad tonight.
You alone?
I don't know anybody
on the upper westside.
Where are you from?
Upper eastside.
My husband left me.
Our friends were his friends.
I haven't really
spoken to anyone.
I mean, really spoken to anyone.
I feel so invisible.
Sometimes I forget I'm here.
I was married.
My husband cheated on me
left and right.
And it made me feel
like I was crazy all the time.
One day he tells me
it's my fault
he saw other women.
So I picked up a knife
and told him
it was his fault
I was stabbing him.
I did a little jail time,
but it was worth it.
Now I'm free,
and he is scared shitless of me.
That's great.
I wish I would have
stabbed my husband.
I used to be dangerous.
I don't know what happened.
I got so scared.
I mean, what's so important
about living longer
and feeling safe?
Rita.
Look. Look who's here.
How are you?
You were great.
Ladies' room?
I'm so sorry. I...
What are you doing?
I'm really... I'm... I'm...
I thought you were
somebody else.
I thought you were the bathroom.
Jeez.
I was expecting...
I'm really...
Really, really sorry.
Are you all right?
I've been waiting in here
for half an hour.
She said she'd be
a few minutes. I... I...
Where is she?
She's in the bar with... with...
With her husband.
But I, I knew her first, though.
She... i mean, we broke up.
I don't remember why.
I bet she does.
I do. So do I. I'm just lying.
I mean, I haven't really
been with anybody since her.
No, it's just that...
See, I left her...
I lost an argument, and she...
I... i walked away
like it didn't matter.
Then I see her here tonight...
Let me ask you something.
Do you think she was
trying to get back at me?
I don't know.
I'm really sorry
about before. I...
It was an accident.
It was an accident.
Yeah.
Good night.
You must think I'm easy.
Do you come here a lot?
No.
Tonight's not a good night
to get together.
Is there any chance
that you'll be here
a week from tonight?
There's a chance.
I'm sorry. I didn't
realize it was so late.
How are you tonight?
Fine.
It's a beautiful night out.
So warm.
I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
Pat.
Pat. Hi.
I'm Mrs. Nelson.
Actually, miss Moore.
I was Mrs. Nelson when I lived
here with my husband,
but he doesn't
live here anymore,
and if you see any mail for him,
you can just throw it out.
Are you new?
A few months.
Thank you. Have a good night.
Someone dropped this.
That's mine.
It must have fell out.
She's very pretty. Thank you.
Your daughter? Yeah.
She looks like you.
Really?
Most people said she
looked like my wife.
What?
Well, you see...
My daughter died recently.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's ok. Are you all right?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Good night.
Good night.
I was going to make some coffee.
Would you like a cup?
It's great coffee.
Well, this is...
This is very nice. Thank you.
Please. I didn't feel
like going to sleep anyway.
I haven't been
sleeping much myself.
That's understandable.
She was a good kid.
She was a senior...
Her fourth year
at the high school
of performing arts.
What did she want to be?
A singer.
She had a great voice.
She got that from me.
Yeah.
I don't know, it's really funny
that things that
are inside of you
that never come out...
And then they come out
in your kids.
It's...
She was like...
It was like she was the adult,
and I was the kid.
She was the older one.
She used to give me advice.
She'd say, "daddy..."
"Why don't you
talk nice to mommy?
"Daddy...
Maybe you should get a job."
"Daddy, don't take a hit with 17
when the dealer's
got 6 showing."
That's something I taught her.
I miss her so much.
I don't care what anybody says.
You never...
You know...
So, you got rid
of your prick husband.
Good for you.
I'm sorry. I can't...
I shouldn't have said that.
I don't even know the guy.
Yes, you do.
Yeah.
So you think you'll
ever marry again?
I'm not thinking about that now.
I... i want to go back
to medical school.
That's where I met my husband.
He became a cardiologist.
I became a nurse
and a cardiologist's wife.
But... I'm going back,
and I'm going to
finish this time,
and I'm going to
become a pediatrician.
Good for you.
I... that's... that is terrific.
I think it's great
when people who have
money get jobs anyway.
You've been dragged
through the mud by some guy.
Your life's in
a fuckin' shambles,
you pick yourself up,
you turn it around,
you become a pediatrician.
Yeah.
Ok.
I'm gonna go get that.
Don't go away.
May I help you?
Hi, I'm Andy.
I'm Mr. Santi's nephew.
My uncle wanted me to pick up
a payment you owe him.
Mr. Santi's here?
No. We dropped him off.
We?
Yeah.
Yeah. Well, look, Andy...
You know, I only have
a few bucks on me,
so, maybe...
Listen, they told me to tell you
that if you didn't have
what they wanted
that they'd wait and take you
someplace you could get it,
like your brother's bar?
Well, I'm still on duty.
I'm not off duty
for a couple of hours.
Maybe they want to come back.
I think they're gonna wait.
See you later.
Yeah.
Who was at the door?
It was the gas man.
God.
What?
I don't want to
trouble you with this.
No. Tell me.
There was a check
that was made out to them
from the building,
and I thought I had it
in the book downstairs,
but I looked. It's...
I don't know... these guys,
when they show up,
they want to be paid.
Otherwise,
they notify the building.
I looked everywhere. I don't
know what happened to it.
How much?
I don't know.
It was 189, 190 something.
Around $200.
If I could get home,
I got the money,
but, they want to be paid now.
My supervisor comes at 6:00.
Well, I have my checkbook.
Let me pay them,
and then you can pay me.
No, no, no, I couldn't
ask you to do that.
Plus, your name
would be on the check,
and if they saw
that I had a tenant pay...
They look at their records,
I'd be out of here.
Well, I might have it in cash.
You want to wait, and I'll see?
I don't want to bother you.
No, it's ok.
I hate to ask.
Please, you've been
through so much.
Don't worry. We'll fix this.
I could let you have it
by the end of the day.
Be right back.
I feel so stupid.
I had the damn check.
God.
Hey. Philly.
What time is it?
Late. Wake up.
What are you watching,
gone with the wind?
No.
That's funny.
No, I was watching a good movie.
What's that movie?
Claude Raines and Bette Davis.
He's the banker?
Mr. Skeffington.
Yeah, Mr. Skeffington.
Yeah, that looked
just like Bette Davis.
Go to bed.
I'll do that.
No, I got it. It's all right.
There's more food in the kitchen
if you want more chow.
All right.
You look very nice.
All right, fine. I know
what you're thinking.
You do?
Yeah. I'm a nutsy old lady.
Make fun. Go ahead.
In 20 years, we'll
see how funny it is
when you're laying here,
and I'm laughing.
I'm not laughing. You look nice.
I'm so tired of this.
So tired of age.
Look at my hands.
I always had thin skin.
Now they look so old.
My hands impress me.
So what if I'm nutsy?
Is that gonna
kill me any sooner?
Mary, you look nice.
Believe me, it's a pleasure
to see you like this.
What the hell
is the matter with you?
Nothin'.
I had a nice weekend.
You met someone.
You wanted milk or lactate?
Lactate.
How much do you need?
I don't know.
A few hundred?
I got a visit
this morning on the job.
You got a visit? Yeah.
Jesus Christ.
You know what?
Why don't you just work for me
I mean, I'll pay him off
free and clear.
Philly, these are my debts.
I'll pay 'em off
my way. I got plans.
How much you need to give him?
400.
That's all you owe?
No. It's just a payment.
You're not gonna gamble
this money, are you?
I'm not even gonna answer that.
You don't normally
give this big of an amount.
I'm just tired of it, Philly.
I want to finish it.
I'm tired of this shit.
All right.
I'm going up to the bar.
I'll give you the money.
Thanks, Phil.
Who is she?
He was so sad.
And real.
No act, no game.
I was so comfortable with him.
Where did you meet him?
I was at this club
looking for the bathroom,
and I couldn't find it.
And I opened this door,
and he pulls me
and then kisses me.
In the bathroom? Jesus.
It wasn't the bathroom.
And it wasn't... I mean...
At first, I was,
you know, surprised,
a little scared,
but then we started talking,
and he was so sweet.
And like I said,
it felt totally safe
to be with him.
You see, he... he... he...
He was waiting
for this other woman.
Another woman?
And he's kissing you?
Sounds like a great catch.
We connected, in a way.
We saw each other.
Well, I should hope
you saw each other,
otherwise, you might have
been kissing something else.
Not that I think you would care.
Forget it. You don't understand.
I understand.
You got swept away.
No.
I mean, yes, but it
was more than that.
He asked to see me again.
What's his name?
I don't know.
Well...
Try to find out
before you marry him.
Thanks, Philly.
You know, I'm glad to do it.
So what are you
doing this weekend?
It's supposed to be
a beautiful day on Sunday.
You want to go to the movies?
If it's a beautiful day,
you want to spend it
at the movies?
I don't know. I...
We'll see.
Thanks.
Must be a nice woman,
you know, just...
Giving you 400 bucks
just like that.
Well, to tell you
the truth, Phil...
She, she gave me 2,
but I... i thought...
I want to get her
a "thank you" gift
or maybe take her out
to dinner or something.
Yeah. You see? I knew it.
I knew it. See how I know you?
Give me that back.
Just give it back.
What?
This was about
impressing a woman.
It wasn't about paying
your debt. Same old shit.
Nothing's ever gonna change.
You did the same thing
with Fanny.
You don't remember, but I do.
You put yourself in debt
to make that woman happy.
In the end,
it still wasn't enough.
You want to tell me why
my marriage didn't work?
Is that what you want to do?
Who do you think you are?
You think because
you have a business,
because you're successful,
you're wise?
I know enough.
You know nothing, Phil.
I know plenty.
Everything's got to be
the easy way with you, right?
You bang your head against
the wall with these shit jobs.
I got my plans. Don't you worry.
I'm gonna call cousin Louie
again in sorrento
about that import
business idea of mine.
It's a goddamn
good idea, Philly.
I just didn't do the research.
And he didn't understand
what kind of business
it could be.
He understood.
He didn't understand it.
He understood. He called me
after the last time
to ask me to tell you
to please stop bothering him
with the faxes
and the phone calls,
'cause he's not interested
in opening up
an American store already.
I didn't have to, of course,
'cause like
all your other plans,
the minute it doesn't
happen overnight,
you lose interest anyway.
And all the while, you could...
Be working with me, you know?
I'm not a bartender.
I know. You're... you're
an elevator operator.
Gypsy cabdriver. Now you sell
hot watches on the street.
You're not anything.
Phil...
I've been dying a slow death
since the day
my wife threw me out.
A woman walks into my elevator,
and she sees me, Phil.
She sees me,
and I think maybe something else
can happen for me.
Why? I don't know.
I don't care.
But this can't be my life.
This can't!
Now, you want to give me
the money, Phil... fine.
You don't...
I got to be to work at 4:00.
Hi. Hi.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
No, no, no.
I would've come earlier,
but I figured I'd
wait for my break.
I... i got the money.
Great. Come in.
Ok. Mel.
Yeah.
What a voice.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, anyway, here you go,
and I can't thank you enough.
No problem.
One... wait. Just one... Second.
Here. It's just a thank you.
Pat, you didn't have to do this.
No, I know, but I wanted to.
It's a really good year.
I looked it up.
This must have been expensive.
I wanted to
do something special.
I can't.
Please. You'll hurt my feelings.
At least have some with me?
You sure I'm not interrupting?
Look around. It's just me.
Well, his family was rich.
My god.
His father was one of
the first neurosurgeons
in the country.
Yeah?
My wife's was one of the first
oldsmobile salesmen
in staten island.
It's true.
God.
Yeah.
How long were you together?
25 years of bliss.
Do you miss it, being married?
Yeah, sure. I miss it.
Why'd you split up?
She threw me out.
Kind of took the fun
out of the marriage for me.
No, no, we weren't...
We weren't getting along
for quite a while.
I would always try
to do right by her,
but I always did it
the wrong way.
And then after a while,
she would just wait
for me to fuck up,
which I always did.
What were you trying to do?
Well, I always wanted
my own business.
Not my father's
or my brother's, but mine.
And I have this cousin in Italy
who's got this
olive oil-tomato business,
and I wanted to sell his stuff
here. You know, import.
And then, after a while,
expand to, like, cheeses
and pasta and...
It's a terrific idea.
New yorkers will pay anything
if you tell them it's imported.
Yeah. My brother says that
my cousin's not interested.
So go to Italy
and change his mind.
It's a very good idea.
Yeah.
Why did that prick bastard
husband ever leave you?
Another woman, younger.
Pediatrician.
Did you know that,
he shopped around?
That he was... 16 years
you were together.
You must have known
something was going on.
Why? Why should I
have been expected
to look over my shoulder
all of the time?
He lied.
He lied about...
Not wanting children.
He lied about...
Loving our life.
He lied about loving me.
What's the difference
if I knew or not?
He still would have left.
He wanted someone younger.
You're right. He's a prick.
The guy's a prick.
Men are pricks.
We're all pricks.
No.
We... we act like we know it all,
you know, and we
got it all together,
but we don't know what's
going on half the time.
I mean, we're scared to death.
Of what?
Not finding it.
Finding what?
I... i don't know.
Our place, maybe.
I... i mean, I've had moments.
Times when I love my wife,
and I knew that there
was no other place
that I should be.
But...
Those are moments,
and then they go.
And when my daughter died,
I thought I'd never
have another one.
And then all of a sudden,
out of nowhere...
It starts to change.
Yeah.
Here's to finding more of them.
Yeah?
It's pat. Is my brother
Philly there?
Yeah, he's here. Hold on.
This is Phil.
Hi. It's me.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, pal, what's going on?
Well, I wanted to say...
We need more rice. What?
Look, we'll talk again later.
But if you're still
offering... Ok.
Ok what the hell
are you talking about?
Ok, I mean ok.
Ok to you paying my debts,
but I'm gonna only work
part-time in the bar.
And I have a few conditions.
A few what?
Conditions.
This is amateur night
at Jasper's
where you get to take
all that rehearsin'
you've been doin' in the shower
and show us what you got.
One Margarita.
It's...
It's the only way
I can keep track.
It's his first night here,
so please give him a big hand.
All right!
God.
You are painful.
I mean, if you're going
to go after a dream,
pick the right one.
I'm sure you're a nice person,
but face the music.
Can you even hear the music?
Excuse me. The manager's sorry,
but we have to ask you to leave.
But she's awful.
You gonna be sick?
What?
What is the point
of what you're doing?
Excuse me?
In here. Fixing your makeup.
He's going to dump you
eventually
for someone younger,
so what is the point?
I mean, you're
a nice-looking woman.
Why does everything
have to be about men?
Excuse me.
Oops.
You need some coffee.
You know, I once heard you sing,
and I complimented you,
and you completely ignored me.
I'm sorry. That was rude.
Yes, it was.
But you're a terrific singer.
Maybe people with talent
are allowed to be rude.
How come you only
made one record?
'Cause nobody bought that one.
I did.
Do you need some
help getting home?
I'm fine.
Don't you...
Have to go back and do
the amateur thing?
No. My boss cut it
short tonight.
Sorry.
I don't mind. Although,
my boyfriend is waiting for me,
so if you're gonna
be ok in here...
He's gay.
What?
Your friend.
You don't even know
who I'm talking about.
Yeah, I do.
That young guy
with the beautiful...
Voice.
I saw you looking
at him when he sang.
I saw your expression.
I... I know that look.
I don't know
how you can know that.
When you're laying
in the gutter,
you can see underneath people
a little better than usual.
You don't look
like the gutter type.
I'm a native.
I just clean up well.
That's from living
on the upper eastside
for 20 years.
I learned how to let
doormen carry my bags.
I learned how to order wine
and cater parties.
I dumped all my friends
from home because their...
Husbands didn't
make as much as mine.
And it was difficult
to do things with them,
things they couldn't afford.
Ha.
Feels good
to admit that finally.
Funny what you
can tell a stranger
and you can't
tell people you know.
I've told so many
stories all my life.
I'm so tired of telling stories.
He left you?
I don't know who he left.
I'm not sure where
I've been for 20 years.
I knew deep down
he saw other women.
I knew for years.
I just kept thinking...
He must know I know.
That's why he stays.
Because I let him
do what he wants.
Because...
I understand what he needs,
and I don't make it difficult.
He'll never leave.
Why should he?
He can do whatever he wants.
As long as he stays.
There are all kinds
of marriages.
At least I'm married.
At least I'm safe.
It's amazing.
Isn't it?
The things you find
yourself agreeing to?
Then...
Some guy with great hands
kisses me
in a dark room,
and I'm saved.
This is why it all happened.
This will be my new story.
How I met my second husband.
Where'd you go to, a party?
Yeah.
You know...
After we spoke,
I talked to my brother.
I called him,
and I made a deal with him.
I, you know,
I figured what the heck.
Maybe if I work for him
part-time or something...
Look...
What?
It's late.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm just...
Not in the mood tonight.
What the hell's wrong with you?
Hi. Judy?
Where would you like me
to set up?
Living room?
Sounds good.
Can I get you anything?
A drink?
A glass of water
would be great. Thanks.
Sorry I'm a little late.
The cabs, they see this table,
and they pass right by me.
Ok if I move these?
Sure.
Here.
Thanks.
So, how long has it been
since you've had a massage?
I...
Don't remember.
Yikes. That's no good.
I brought my own towels,
but if you prefer yours...
Yeah.
Beautiful.
I also brought my own music,
but, again, if you
prefer your own...
This is fine.
So...
Where'd you see my ad?
Some... some New York magazine.
Ok.
Well, you want the hour
or hour and a half?
Can I decide later?
Sure.
Usually, no, but...
I have no clients after you,
so you're in luck.
You may want to take off
your jewelry.
Now, this is...
Totally for you, so...
However far you want me
to go or not go,
it's entirely up to you.
I've been doing this
for 3 years.
I can give all kinds of massage.
What
well, Swedish,
shiatsu, deep tissue,
erotic...
Or any combo.
It's your choice.
They're entirely safe.
Is there any...
Specific areas you'd like me
to concentrate on?
On me?
No.
Would you like me
to take these off?
Can I decide later?
Sure.
I just have to go wash my hands,
so just make yourself
comfortable.
We're going to start
on your stomach,
so place the towel over you,
and I'll be right back.
Your bathroom?
Over this way.
Well...
Let's get you warmed up here.
I just want you to know...
That I will not do anything
you don't want me to do.
This is all about pleasure,
about touch.
Bodies touching.
Just let everything go.
And if you want to touch me,
feel free.
People are so scared nowadays.
They forget how good
it is to be touched.
It's important.
There you go.
Just let it go.
That's right.
Just let everything go.
That's right.
Hi.
Hi.
Good massage?
He was a good-looking guy.
You use him before?
No, first time.
That's a good job.
If you don't mind my asking,
what does a guy get
for a 2 1/2 hour massage?
Ahem.
Look, I want to apologize.
I... i was a little,
abrupt before.
I'm sorry.
You want some coffee?
Yeah.
Yeah.
There's something that
I want to get off my chest.
Ahem.
It's been bugging me.
It's about the first
night that we talked...
The night I borrowed
the money from you.
No, no, no. You don't have to.
No, no, I want to.
I want to come clean
about something.
About not needing the money
for the gas guy?
You knew?
Pat...
A $189 gas bill
for a fifth Avenue co
so why'd you give it to me?
I don't know.
I figured you were good for it.
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.
I was wondering if one night...
This is... Jesus, this is tough.
I'm... I'm really
a little rusty at this.
Pat, don't.
What?
Don't...
I don't want to hurt
your feelings.
Hurt my feelings about what?
I think I know
what you're going to ask.
You do?
And I'd rather you didn't.
See, I just wanted to know
if you wanted to have
dinner with me sometime,
maybe go out to a movie.
Pat, I just asked you
not to ask me.
You were right?
Yeah.
Well, I thought maybe
you could've been
completely off the Mark.
No.
So you knew
what I was going to...
Is that a no?
Look, I... I... I...
I think you're
a wonderful person,
but I think that...
That I like you?
Yes.
And I...
I think I know what you want.
Yeah?
So?
I think you're
a terrific person, too.
I... i like being with you.
I'd like to, you know,
see you more...
Take you out, spend
some time with you.
But that's not possible.
Why? Because of what I do?
No. Are you sure?
Look, you're not being honest.
It's not just about
spending time with me.
You feel comfortable
with me, right?
We have a good time
when we're talking...
Nice time telling jokes
or kidding around, right?
Yes, but I don't
want you thinking
it can be anything
more than that.
Well, it's none of your business
what I think or what I want.
I mean, you can't control that.
Well, it just won't happen.
How do you know it won't?
I know.
How can you know?
I mean, you can't know
a thing like that.
I'm not attracted
to you that way.
So maybe it'll change. It won't.
How do you know that?
I know.
I want to feel my life.
I want to be authentic.
I want to stop
agreeing to things
I don't really want.
Then stop.
Look, Judith, I'm not
asking you to marry me.
I'm just saying let's spend
a little time together.
Whatever happens, doesn't
happen, it doesn't matter.
Of course it's going to matter.
If you want to sleep
with me, and I don't,
it's going to matter.
No, believe me, it won't matter.
So if I want to just be friends
that's what we'll be?
Yes.
Unless it changes.
I don't think it will.
Well, you never know.
How can you know?
You don't know.
Things change.
I... i might lose interest.
I mean, it's not
a great possibility
that I might
lose interest, but...
Come on. Come on.
Come on, what?
What? We're laughing here.
We're having a good time.
I don't want this.
Then why'd you come down here?
To apologize.
You came down here
to apologize, is that it?
Is that authentically
why you came down here?
No.
I came down here because...
I can't sleep...
And because I don't want
to be alone.
Sorry.
The lady upstairs...
Did you hear the bell?
Yeah, I heard the bell, but...
Doesn't anybody work anymore?
Yeah, we work.
The lady was moving
a refrigerator.
Writing the great American
novel up there.
Fell over on a cat. We had...
Are you wearing that shirt?
So, 6:30, 7:00?
What time is the movie?
8:00. 6:30.
6:30. I'm here.
Good night, pat.
Good night. Hi, bill.
Where the hell's the damn key?
I'm getting it.
Because, really, I swear,
you make me cry.
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Because you know why?
Because when you sing,
it's not about just you.
It's not about now.
It's the whole black experience,
you know what I'm saying?
Because, you see, black people...
African-American people...
When they sing
sentimental songs,
they're not sentimental, right?
You know why? Why?
Because they have the pain
to back it up.
Yes. I have the pain.
It'sl'm full the pain. Of pain.
You are absolutely right.
You know what?
Thank you so much.
You're welcome. Thank you.
You are so great.
You're so great.
You bring your friends
next time.
Keep on singing.
Keep on singing, now.
I got plenty of bad times
to sing about,
don't you worry.
Ok. You get home safe.
I will.
This is your fault.
This is her fault.
Why?
Because you said I was rude.
Every since you said I was rude,
it's like I got to talk
to every psycho
that comes in the place
just so I don't feel bad.
Hey, there he is.
Hi, Gary. How you doing?
Nice to see you again.
And this is pat.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
So, you want a drink?
Sure. Please.
So, how was your audition?
It went better than
I thought it would.
Good.
Jesus.
It's called
a victorian gypsy ring.
Apparently, they would
change the stones
as they, I don't know,
progressed in society
or something.
It was bought for me in London.
You want to go out later?
I really got to get out.
I'd love to.
I have to get up early, though.
They sold the country house
my husband and I bought.
Actually, my husband bought it,
but thanks to the divorce god,
I get half.
God.
Well...
This place that
I'm thinking about
is after-hours, so...
It might be best
if you just don't go home.
I suppose.
It's not like I have
an actual life.
Well, this girlfriend of mine
took me to this place
called the confessional.
Absolutely fabulous.
I mean, it is a scene, honey.
That dance floor
gets pretty wild.
You may not want to try it
on your first time.
Really?
But, I mean, it's
just fun to watch.
Come back here around 2:00.
We going to go.
We're going.
Ok.
And she gave me these.
What do they do?
She says
it just makes you feel free,
and it makes you want
to just touch everybody.
And for one night,
it makes you forget
all the ex-husbands
and gay boyfriends
you can think of.
You going to be all right?
Look...
It's my own fault.
It's not like I lie to myself.
I just love him.
I don't know.
You know what it is?
It's like I've always
had this thing
for beautiful,
gentle men.
You know?
It's like they have
sort of a... a kindness
I never found in other men,
and I like that.
And they're sensitive, too.
You know, it's like having a guy
and a girlfriend
at the same time.
Of course, being that sensitive,
they feel things that
regular guys don't...
Like the need to suck dick.
So, you know...
You take the good with the bad.
Well.
Where are you going?
Liz invited me to this
after-hours place downtown
called...
Confession... al.
It's somewhere
in the meat district.
Boy, you... you look amazing.
You better be careful
going down to a place like that
dressed the way you are.
You look terrific.
Ok. Really? Yeah.
You look very nice
in your uniform.
Thank you.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no.
I'm, a little high.
That's...
Perfectly all right.
Good night.
Take care.
Time for the night of
your life, mademoiselle.
Thank you very, very much.
Whoo!
Never saw him again.
Hello.
Ahem. If you...
Need any electrical work done,
I have a man
who knows the house.
He... he upgraded it about...
Sorry.
6 years ago.
Anyway, his name is...
Grimes. Sid grimes.
He's... he's a terrific guy...
A real character...
Lived in the same house
for over 60 years.
Wow. Wow.
And his family were...
They were one of
the original town settlers.
Anyway,
he's a terrific guy,
and...
There are also
2 plumbers in town.
Again, the one that I use is...
Kei...
What is your problem?
I thought we were going
to be civilized.
I... i have to apologize for this.
You are such a child.
I can't believe you're
behaving like this.
You all right, Bob.
Hey, what are you...
I want to say something.
You're out of your mind.
Do you know that?
Can we please...
Shut up. Shut up.
I want you to know
I don't hate you.
I don't believe this.
I... i want to get on
with my life,
and I can't do it hating you.
I know I did a lot
of things wrong, too.
I left me long before you did.
Excuse me, miss?
I lied.
I lied about a lot of things,
and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
We don't need to have
this discussion now, ok?
I'm over you, believe me.
What?
You stupid...
Asshole.
That's all you're going to say?
What do you want me to say
for what?
I fell in love.
I feel something.
For the first time,
my heart is open.
I'm learning how to give love
and receive love
from someone
who knows how, finally!
And I'm supposed to be sorry?
I never said I didn't love you!
Just because it fell apart
doesn't mean it wasn't
love at some point!
I am through!
God, what was it?
What was I so scared of
that you were a better choice?
Help!
I mean, this situation
clearly called for me
to attack him.
He takes everything
so damn seriously.
So he's going to press charges?
It depends.
His lawyer said he'd
forget the whole thing
if I forfeited my share
of money from the house.
That is bullshit.
That's what I said,
but then...
They explained how
assault and battery
carries a 30-day sentence
and a fine.
And it would be on my record,
and...
I mean, you...
No. My credit cards are, like...
Look, you're
really upset now.
Let me...
Don't think about it, ok?
I'm off tonight.
Take a nice rest
and let me take you
out to dinner.
Ok? We'll get
dressed up real nice.
We'll go to some
really nice place,
and then later on, we'll go
visit Liz down at Jasper's.
What do you think?
Would you like that?
Thank you.
Yeah.
So... so what are we celebrating?
I got so much to tell you,
but I didn't wanna say anything
until everything was all set.
I called my cousin in sorrento.
I got everything lined up...
All the research...
And I told him
how much people here
were willing to pay
for a can of fucking tomatoes,
and he said he's interested.
Pat, that's so great.
Yes, yes.
Congratulations.
Thank you very much.
We leave on November 3rd.
What?
Now, don't... you don't have
to decide right now.
Pat...
I can't go to... to Italy.
It's 6 weeks away.
It's just a little trip
to get away from everything.
Pat.
It doesn't cost me
anything, either,
because this is
a business write-off.
Don't... please.
What
what's wrong, kid?
This...
Let me...
Let me think about it, ok?
Yeah. Yeah, well,
that's all I'm saying.
Just think about it.
Yeah. Just...
Let's not talk about it now.
Fine. Sure.
Fine.
Yeah.
It's just that...
And I know you don't
wanna hear this,
and I'll never say it again,
but I feel it's better
that we should...
Say it now,
and then we're clear.
I feel love for you.
I... i know you don't feel
exactly the same,
and that's fine,
but...
I like loving you.
It's selfish.
It makes me feel good.
And...
You know, I...
I have to love somebody.
I... it's just...
I have to.
You know, I'm 52 years old,
and I'm not looking
for another lifetime.
I've already had one.
As long as I can be with you...
Do for you.
Nothing's perfect.
Are you folks ready?
So don't decide now.
Let's just eat dinner and...
Yeah, we are ready.
Yes, I'll have the Risotto
and half salad.
Yeah. What... does steak
come with anything?
You have a choice
between baked potato,
rice, or French fries.
Baked potato.
And make the steak medium rare.
Ok.
Pat...
Pat...
I can't go to Italy.
Maybe it bothered you...
Before...
What I said about how I feel.
Not at all.
I feel the same way...
Just not exactly.
Yeah.
It's because you have
a lot of things...
Ahead of you.
Lot of things you have to do.
That's just it.
I...
I wanna know...
What I'm supposed to be doing,
what I'm really meant to do.
And I...
I don't think
I'll be able to see it
if I have someone
standing in front of me.
What if I'm standing behind you?
No.
I... i know.
You got a...
You got a lot of beautiful
things ahead of you.
So do you.
Look...
I'm gonna go, ok?
I'll give you some time,
you know, to settle in.
I'll give you my new number
when it gets hooked up, ok?
Sure.
Sure.
Bye, kid.
You'll just probably
hold them today.
Ok.
They need to be held.
If you have any problems,
just let me know, ok?
Thank you.
Hey.
Hi.
How you doing?
How are you?
Well, it's so good to see you.
You're so happy today.
So good to see you so happy.
Good night.
Good night, shari.
Good night, Linda.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Is tonight the test?
No, I had it this morning.
God... was that this morning?
I'm sure you did great.
Good night.
Good night.
Dr. Nelson,
you're wanted
at the nurses' station.
Dr. Robert Nelson,
please report
to the nurses' station.
Bob Nelson? Cardiologist?
Yeah, I think
he's consulting here.
You know him?
Not really. Good night.
Good night.
Something happened, pat.
In just a second, I saw it.
It's like all this time
I wasn't paying attention,
and all of a sudden
I could see it.
I don't know anything anymore.
I don't know how long it'll last
or if it's right or wrong.
Maybe all we have are
seconds we see clearly.
Give it up for pat, everybody!
Cameriere!
Prego, una bottiglia!
No. Due, due.
Baby.
Grazie.
I sing in the shower
a little bit, that's all.
Thank you.
I told him
I didn't expect you tonight.
He was happy to hear
you were doing so well.
Ok, give him the other one.
Here you go.
No, I want the other one.
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Leave it on. I love that song.
Leave it.
