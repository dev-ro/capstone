- What is it?
- Back entrance!
I'm not alone.
- Who are they?
- No idea! Just meet me!
Sir?
POINT BLANK
lt's looking very good.
The baby's in position.
But the cervix is very dilated.
You'll have to be careful.
Careful... Careful how?
Best to stay on your back
until delivery.
For six weeks?
Pregnancy lasts 9 months,
not 7 and a half.
No choice. Stay home.
Let him cater to you.
That's right. You heard her.
Here, look.
You see her better.
So... it's same as the last time.
Still a girl.
She a girl alright.
I see a little doodad.
Like a weanie.
No, that's...
That's her finger.
She's just fine.
See you in two weeks.
In the meantime... bed rest.
With the TV in the room.
You'll love it!
What are you doing, Nadia?
Forget the books.
l'll do that. Sit down.
You should be in bed already.
A month in the hay: no way!
In the hay?
Yes, way.
One month on your back.
If l'm on my back...
What are you doing? Careful!
I want you.
That's impossible.
Out ofthe question. Move.
Get comfortable.
Your mama's insane!
You can still kiss me.
Sure...
- Let me move the TV. l'll be late.
- Forget the TV.
Come here.
Not that...
One little kiss.
One kiss.
Another.
And another!
He stole the ball right from his feet.
That's a foul.
Lt's you.
Lucky it's not the intern.
He's up in Pediatrics.
Lt's quiet. There's just number6
who keeps ringing.
And a guy hit by a motorcycle.
When's your test?
- In a month.
- Damn.
If you pass, you'll become a nurse.
And my boss.
You're in fora rude awakening.
What's this?
I was beating Argentina!
I am so sorry!
- Give it back!
- Just a sec.
Don't start playing!
Get going, Maradona.
Don't be a pain!
See you tomorrow.
Pain in the butt.
You can't keep ringing.
Lt's not nice.
I-Iello.
Excuse me!
What the hell are you doing?
- He stopped breathing...
- lt's not your job.
The respirator was cut.
He started suffocating.
Can you describe the man any better?
He was gone before I got there.
I barely saw him.
And I was busy tending to him.
What do we know?
Hit by a motorcycle. No ID.
Judging by his uniform,
he's a computer repairman.
We're checking but it'll take time.
And physically?
TBI, bruises,
gash in the stomach.
When can we question him?
I stopped sedating him...
Not before... 10 hours.
Late morning.
Get the photo? Take prints.
Have Auclert stay
and call us when he's up.
Here you have the office
and my cell.
If you remember anything
about that man,
call me.
Okay, sure.
Goodbye.
Next time, find me
before taking action.
L'll give him time to suffocate.
Listen up... You're not a nurse yet.
So don't get overzealous,
because I take the fall.
Are we clear?
Thank you.
Asshole...
What are you doing?
Ratatouille.
Next time wake me up.
You okay?
Lie down. l'll finish.
- l'm fine.
- Go lie onthe couch.
Your hubby's a hero!
Is he?
You bet.
Someone tried to kill a patient.
Without me, he'd be dead.
L'm proud of myself.
Then the cops came.
It took forever.
Samuel!
Stop! Stop!
Samuel?
Why are you crying?
What's going on?
What did you do, Samuel?
I didn't do anything, honey.
Where are you?
Shut up and listen!
Who are you? You shut up!
Where's my wife?
No, stop! Stop! Nadia!
Next one's for her.
Okay...
Get that guy out of the hospital.
Why us?
No questions.
Take the phone I left.
If he's not out at noon, she dies.
Some goes if you coll the cops.
Now you know the rules.
You got 3 hours.
Please don't touch her!
She's pregnant!
No room for failure.
Drop everything.
Meyer's our numberi priority. That clear?
Yes, sir.
Homicide can't get involved.
I want results.
My men are in place. lt'll be quick.
It better be.
Why are they worked up?
The tycoon Francis Meyer
got iced in his office.
Chief put Werner on it.
Did you check that guy's prints?
- Not yet.
- And?
What you waiting for?
Why does Werner get the big cases?
Pantin Cold Storage Plant
l'm taking him for x-rays.
Sure.
If I tell my Narc friends,
you can expect a visit.
Call you back...
Fuck!
Wanted
You can take him.
Back in 5 minutes.
I don't leave him.
Hugo Sartet,
armed robbery, suspected homicide.
Tell Auclert we're on our way there.
- What floor?
- 7.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
You're bleeding.
Lt's nothing. I bumped my head.
We're going for x-rays.
Okay. Right away.
See you soon.
Let's go back. Something came up.
Where are we?
Why do we have nothing on Sartet?
Smart guy, only arrested once.
Suspected of working
with Corsicans, gypsies.
Seems very much in demand.
Where are we?
At the hospital, okay?
Who are you?
No one. A nurse's aide.
Let me go...
I don't want trouble.
I want my wife back, that's all.
They asked me to get you out,
and I will.
Okay?
Here are some clothes.
This way.
Samuel!
Move it.
Move it!
Hey.
What is it?
Do you have the... the register?
What register?
Forget it.
There. The ambulance.
No...
The bus.
Where is he?
Who?
The patient here.
Samuel took him with a cop.
An officer.
- In the elevator.
- No answer.
Go look.
Lock this place down!
And then?
They went up to 7.
Lt's being renovated. No cameras.
We pick him back up in the entrance.
5 feet from you. That sucks.
What are you doing here?
Chief says Sartet is linked to Meyer.
Since he put me onthe Meyer case,
you'll have to step aside.
That guy...
He attacked one of my men.
From now on, he's my case.
Let's go.
Show me the tapes.
Yes, right away.
FRANCIS MEYER MURDERED
Where are you?
- We're outside.
- Put him on.
- What?
- Put him on!
Lt's me.
I followed that guy from the hospital.
Kidnapped his wife.
Where are you?
Cold storage plant.
And Marconi?
Here with me.
Acting clueless,
but I know he's lying.
Stay put. l'm coming.
Hold on...
What's going on here?
You know him?
Where's my wife?
- Where is she?
- She's fine.
She'll be home tonight.
We say goodbye here.
Don't go anywhere!
You're out.
Call him and get me my wife! Now!
Gunfire near the hospital.
- Metro Louis Legrand.
- See you there.
Run a check on the nurse's aide.
Move.
- Where are you?
- Far side. I don't see you.
See me?
Yeah.
Stay here.
Wait!
- What is it?
- Trouble.
What do we do?
Here's no good.
The storage plant, tonight.
We'll get killed.
We have to go, I swear.
Tell him to comeback!
No choice.
Come on.
Okay! No problem, guys.
Take it all.
No problem.
Move!
What the hell?
Drive.
I can't.
Drive!
Shit!
It opened up.
I know where to go.
No, first my wife. Where's the plant?
In Pantin. Sew me up first.
Then we get your wife.
She's fine there.
That's him. There was a second one.
The shooter.
- Sure it wasn't him?
- Positive.
The other one had the gun.
We'll be contacting you again.
A nurse holds up Sartet?
Find anything?
Zero. No record.
Spanish wife, Nadia Cortez.
She's clean too.
Go question his neighbors and family.
L'll see what Max Collet has on Sartet.
The closet. Everything you'll need.
Hurry.
Here.
Take it. lt's cold here.
Where are you going?
To wash off.
Don't shut the door!
Personal gain is probably
what drove the nurse's aide
to run off with Hugo Sartet.
...Sources say Sartet is involved
in the murder of Francis Meyer.
The two men attacked o police officer
and stole his gun,
then attacked a young doctor
who tried to intercede.
If you see either of them,
do nothing
and call the police.
They are armed and dangerous.
L'll ask around about Sartet.
Talk soon.
Okay.
Lt's Samuel Pierret.
We met at the hospital.
L'm not part of this, I swear.
They made me get him out.
They kidnapped my wife.
L'm not in on anything.
- Why didn't you call me?
- I told you!
They said they'd kill her!
So now just help me. And fast.
Calm down. Are you with Sartet now?
Where?
If you want my help,
tell me where you are.
8 Boulevard de Strasbourg.
Fourth floor.
Don't move!
We're onthe way.
8 Boulevard de Strasbourg.
We can get them first, so move it.
See you there.
Don't move!
Don't move.
I didn't do anything.
Move. On your knees.
On your knees!
You had me onthe run.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
You let her come up.
We couldn't stop her.
You two, wait for her squad.
Put on your armbands!
Kill them. l'll get the video.
Go on.
Go on.
Give me your hands.
Bravo!
You're a cop killer now.
Him first.
Did he have to kill her?
Well it's too late now.
We get a bonus.
To the window.
Tell me when the cops come.
Go tell me when the cops come!
Start explaining.
In 5 minutes,
there'll be cops everywhere.
You'll be doing the explaining.
Start talking.
Go fuck yourself.
Next one's for your mouth.
You're dead.
Stop, okay! Stop!
Who are you?
And who tried to waste me?
We're police officers.
All in the same squad.
And her?
She ran another squad.
How did you find me?
How did you get this address?
Marconi.
He's been ratting on you.
What's the connection to Meyer?
What's the connection to Meyer?
Sometimes we supply additional services.
One month ago
Meyer's son found out
he'd been disinherited.
We got the father to change his will.
But the son didn't want
to wait to inherit.
So he asked us
to expedite matters.
Werner disguised it
as a robbery that backfired.
He asked Marconi
to find o good sofecrocker.
And you got the job.
Then we had to kill you.
Things got complicated.
What about a video?
Meyer had surveillance cameras
in his office.
Since it's our case,
we got there first and took the tape.
The son is on it.
Werner can shake him down.
Where's the video?
On a USB key
in the safe in Werner's office.
They're here!
They shot your boss.
- Where are they?
- 4th floor with the others.
Get moving.
Don't shoot!
You're dead.
Out the window!
Come with me!
Susini!
Shit!
Lt's him!
Where is he?
The corridor for Line 8.
Stay here!
Susini!
See him?
Where is he?
Escalator, Line 3.
Line 3, the escalator.
Move away!
Don't shoot, dammit! Are you crazy?
See him?
Stop fucking up!
Where is he?
Platform 3, direction Gallieni.
There's no way out.
Platform 3, Gallieni.
Lt's a dead end.
What are you doing?
Wipe my prints off the gun?
Caught me by surprise.
- Ask any questions?
- No.
Werner...
You have 48 hours.
Homicide must stay out of it.
Excuse me, Chief.
We're on this case.
The nurse called our commander.
To trap her, and look what happened.
I share your pain with you.
But I put Werner on this case.
Make them pay. You hear me?
Yes, sir.
We have to find them fast.
Ask your informers.
Have Marconi call us
if Sartet contacts him.
If he gets away, neither of you will.
What the fuck?
Don't move!
Lt's me...
Where is she?
Where is she?
- And my wife?
- She's alive.
At least until you surrender.
You know about Meyer.
They have no choice.
They want you dead too.
- Where you going?
- Cops.
Don't. They'll kill us both.
- I didn't do anything.
- No one cares!
Why did you show up?
Everything was fine before!
Let's get hold of that video.
They're on it too.
Send them straight to jail.
- But the cops have it!
-I know that.
Just like they have your wife.
Bullshit.
Or they'll kill her.
Who are you? Police?
What is this? Who are you?
Shut up!
No smoking here.
I know.
How do we get inside?
Leave it to me.
Who's he?
No one.
What do you want?
Don't move.
What's with the gun?
Are you crazy?
What the hell? Don't be stupid.
Tie him up.
-What?
-Tie him.
Are you crazy?
Hands behind your back...
Do what I say!
Crazy motherfucker!
Shut up! Shut up!
Let me go, asshole!
Stop moving!
Now his feet.
You're gonna pay for this.
And I mean big!
L'll have you whacked!
Know who I am?
What are you doing?
Werner's number...
Don't be stupid. Let me explain.
Give me his number.
Sartet called. He's coming at I0
-for passports and money.
- Both of them?
- Yeah...
- We'II be there.
Tell Meyer's son to hurry
if he wants the video.
What are you doing?
- Go out.
- Leave him!
Stop it!
Wait outside!
Look at me!
Just look at me.
Don't do it. Let's go. Leave him be.
Come on...
Once we waste the two guys,
she'll to go pee and jump out the window.
She's pregnant.

Sartet works with a guy named Marconi.
I got his address.
Sartet is not our problem. Stop!
If you fuck up, I won't cover you.
Go take statements.
Come here.
Come here!
Wasn't I a cop?
You look too nice.
- They'll spot us.

The last floor.
- What a madhouse!

There's a video onthe USB key.
You'll see.
Move it!

He's my case. Get up.
Hand him over.
I don't think so.

The DVD doesn't work.
Lt's no big deal.
I want to watch it.
