NARRATOR: The Second World War
is coming to an end.
Finland and the Soviet Union
have signed the Moscow Armistice
which decrees that Finland
must disarm the Nazis
and drive them out of Lapland.
The Nazis adopt
a scorched earth tactic
and destroy all roads, bridges,
villages and towns
in their path.
Deep in the wilderness
of Lapland,
there is a man who has decided
to leave the war behind him.
For good.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)
SOLDIER: Thank you, General.
I will pass on the information.
Over and out.
The General,
he has given us orders.
Turn back and head to Norway
from Finland immediately.
Did you tell him he just
killed seven of our men?
I did.
And?
He thinks we were lucky.
Fucking lucky.
(SCOFFS)
The dog tags belong
to a man named Aatami Korpi.
He was a Finnish commando.
The most feared in his unit.
The General said, and I quote,
"He's one mean motherfucker
"that you do not
want to mess with."
He fought in the Winter War.
Lost his home and his family
to the Russians.
He became a ruthless,
vengeful soldier
who took orders from no one.
The Finns, they gave up trying
to discipline or control him.
They just sent him out,
alone into the wilderness
to hunt Russian patrols.
He became a one-man death squad.
(SCOFFS)
SOLDIER: The reports
are unconfirmed,
but it looks like
he has over 300 Russian kills.
The Russians,
they gave him a name.
They call him Koschei,
"The Immortal."
Immortal?
The road is clear, sir.
We are going to follow
our orders, right?
We are turning back?
No.
We are not turning back.
(SNIFFS)
We are losing the war. We are.
In a few months,
this all will be over for us.
When we get back,
they will... (SIGHS)
Hang us all.

you have succeeded

We all know the story.
You'll see what happens when
you take everything from him.
(CHUCKLES DRYLY)
He won't give up.
He'll just keep coming back.
Do you really believe
that he's immortal?
No.
He just refuses to die.
We have a word for that
in Finland,
but it's impossible
to translate.
You see,
this is not about
who's the strongest.
This is about not giving up.
And he won't.
Ever.
No matter what
you bitches are trying.
You will make him stronger.
So...
what is so fucking funny,
is that you...
your boyfriend...
