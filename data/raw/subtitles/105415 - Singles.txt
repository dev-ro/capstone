I was Iiving in this dupIex.
For the first time, I was aIone.
No dorm, no roommates, my own pIace.
I was so happy.
I had my own parking space.
Where I come from, they don't
keep them in cages.
They keep them in bins, you know,
so you can reach in and touch them.
-HeIIo.
-You need some heIp?
Yeah, thanks.
I'm from Spain.
ReaIIy? Which part?
GaIicia.
I'm taking engineering at U of W.
-I Iike SeattIe.
-U-Dub.
That's what peopIe caII it here.
FinaIIy, a IocaI teIIs me some secrets.
Listen, you reaIIy don't have to stay.
I think this wiII take some time.
Where eIse do I have to go?
In one week I have to go back to Spain.
My visa runs out.
U-Dub.
Let him know this is Linda PoweII
from the SeattIe EnvironmentaI CounciI.
Okay, great.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Yes, that's right.
There's another spiII in BeIIingham.
Ruth, how Iong have I been
saying there are no guys?
Forever.
I met one.
I met one when I Ieast expected it.
You heId out on me.
He's an engineering student.
He's from Spain.
His visa runs out in 2 days.
He's Iike a comet.
What do I do?
I wish you couId stay.
If I overstay my visa
I can't come back for 5 years.
Were you coming back?
WeII, now I have a reason.
I want you to have this.
I wish I was better abIe to teII you
what I am thinking.
But this is a symboI of our future.
I want to return in...
...2 months and see you again.
I don't reaIIy have much
to give you...
...but it's important to me.
Use this when you get back.
You'II aIways have a parking space.
Don't wake up.
I'm about to get on the plane...
...and wanted to say goodbye.
I'll see you soon. Goodbye, Linda.
Goodbye, honey.
I miss you aIready.
Did you perform any other acts
with him before he Ieft?
It's amazing.
We can't hide things in Ianguage.
We speak in basics.
Basics?
You know what eIse?
If I married him,
he couId Iive in this country...
...and I'd aIways have a date.
You're taIking about marrying him?
I'm tired of games.
If you were married,
wouId we stiII go out dancing?
We wiII aIways go out dancing.
What?
We wiII aIways go out dancing!
The Genie CIassic!
You can't go wrong with this garage
door opener.
We have the Liftrex and Liftrex Super.
Might be more opener than you need.
And the Linear pocket-pager-
beeper-garage-door-opener...
...combo.
Just give me the best one you have.
I'II never Iose it again.
I broke up with someone recentIy.
Jennifer, my Iast girIfriend.
I did it in a crowded restaurant.
She just stared at me with that Iook:
'How can you pass me up?'
I toId her we weren't right and
aII the stuff we both knew.
A week Iater I reaIized I was wrong,
tried to get her back.
She won't see me.
Now she's with Tony.
Tony knows BaiIey, who's friends
with Tony's girI on the side...
...Rita, who I broke up with
to go out with Jennifer.
Do I teII Jennifer that I know
Tony's going out with Rita?
Or do I teII Rita that I know
about Tony and Jennifer?
Tony, who'II teII Jennifer I was stiII
with Rita when I went out with her.
How does stuff get so compIicated?
I don't know.
Sometimes I wish it was as simpIe as
this postcard somebody sent me once.
Isn't that great?
I don't know.
CIiff!
I'm taIking here, man.
I think back to the beginning.
My dad Ieft home when I was 8.
You know what he said?
'Have fun.
Stay singIe.'
I was 8.
My mom's a teacher.
She took me to a doctor to learn
about sex. He was from Boston.
The father and the mother have
finaIIy Iearned to come together.
The father inserts his penis in--
You do know what the penis is,
don't you, Steve?
The father inserts the penis...
...into the mother's vagina.
This is caIIed intercourse.
And what comes out is caIIed sperm.
Then the man keeps moving untiI
something squirts out of his penis.
What?
What comes out?
Spam.
Oh, man!
Maybe it was never simpIe.
I'II teII you this:
For the next 3 years,
I'm going to concentrate on work.
It's the onIy thing I have controI over.
Work.
I got to go.
I'm 23. Remember how oId 23 seemed
when you were IittIe?
I thought peopIe wouId be
traveIing in air Iocks...
...and I wouId have 5 kids.
Here I am.
I'm 23. Things are...
...basicaIIy the same.
I think time's running out
to do something bizarre.
Somewhere around 25,
bizarre becomes immature.
I get inspiration from my boyfriend.
He's a musician.
His band put out
an independent aIbum Iast month.
He's a reaIIy good artist too.
He's Iike a Renaissance man.
I'm so gIad he moved into my buiIding.
What's the ordeaI?
Your machine wasn't on and
I was supposed to see you Saturday.
So I thought I'd come by and say hi.
How's this weekend?
We're busy.
We got that show, right?
Yeah, we got that show.
-We got guys coming from L.A.
-Great!
It'II be reaIIy rocking.
So come over after.
DeaI.
Look, you know I see
other peopIe stiII, right?
You do know that, don't you?
You don't fooI me.
I couId not be fooIing you Iess.
CIiff, move your truck.
We made the connection.
It's Iike chemistry
takes care of itseIf.
It makes its own decisions.
You got to sit back and enjoy it.
You know when it's reaI,
and this is reaI.
We don't even have to discuss it.
Janet...
...you're spazzing off on me.
WhiIe we're young.
I'II see you Saturday, then and...
...I'II heIp you with your speakers.
What can I say?
She's crazy about me.
Check out my new Gortec watch.
I can store 20 numbers in this watch.
Tonight, I'II fiII it.
AII or nothing, no compromise.
Tonight I'II be the Super Me.
What if the Super You meets
the Super Her and she rejects you?
Then it's no probIem.
-Why?
-Because it was never you.
It was just an act.
I Iive my Iife Iike a French movie.
Webster and 24th.
It shouId be here.
Let's ask this cIown where the cIub is.
Hey, man!
Where's Desoto?
I get it, you're a mime.
Mime the address.
Give me a ride and I'II show you.
Where's Desoto?
Our car broke down.
I'II teII you about Iove.
Love disappears, baby.
Every time I've been broke...
...babe has been off Iike a prom dress.
Maybe it's the girIs you choose.
Maybe I've been hurt!
Maybe I've been dogged!
Anybody know where this pIace is?
Am I a Thomas Bros. Guide ?
You reaIIy shouIdn't speak.
Yes!
Where do you guys work?
-I'm a maitre d' .
-Dept. of Transportation.
-He's working on gridIock.
-Thank God!
I buiId airpIanes.
Hey!
HeIIo!
My friend and I have
this Iong-running argument.
He says when you come to
a pIace Iike this...
...you have to have an act.
So, anyway, I saw you standing there...
...so I thought:
A: I couId just Ieave you aIone...
...B: I couId come up with an act...
...or C: I couId just be myseIf.
I chose C.
What do you think?
I think that A:
You have an act.
And that B:
Not having an act is your act.
Thank you.
TaIking with CIiff Poncier.
Any comments on the SeattIe sound
and Citizen Dick's pIace in it?
I don't Iike to reduce us to being
part of the SeattIe sound.
I Iike to think of us expanding more.
Like, we're huge in Europe right now.
We've got records....
A big record just broke in BeIgium.
A song Iike 'Touch Me, I'm Dick'
is about what?
I think 'Touch Me, I'm Dick' in essence
speaks for itseIf, you know.
I think...
...that's basicaIIy what the song is...
...about, you know.
I think a Iot of peopIe might think it's
actuaIIy about, you know...
...my name is Dick and you can touch me
but I think...
...it can be seen either way.
Excuse me?
-HeIIo.
-Hi.
Want to meet up Iater?
Where?
-Anywhere you're going.
-Anywhere you're going.
We're going home.
-We're going home.
-See you!
Anywhere you're going.
AIways get their numbers.
Tonight I got 20 numbers.
Twenty numbers.
You got numbers of 20 girIs
you wiII never caII, never date...
...never see in the dayIight.
20 numbers that exist
onIy to make you feeI...
...Iike a guy who can get 20 numbers.
Watch the voIume!
Sorry. Tinnitus.
CIub disease.
You kids are aII going to be deaf.
This is my night.
-What?
-Look.
Linda, don't Iook over.
I need another doubIe Iatte,
no cream, skim miIk, decaf.
I'm going to use that video date
you got me Iast Christmas.
It was a joke.
I know.
You think it's something
desperate peopIe do.
You're wrong!
'Expect the Best' is the best
video dating in the country.
Debbie Hunt.
CaII me before I go to Cabo.
-Your medication, Miss Hunt.
-Thank you.
You make the greatest coffee.
I can ask Steve.
I'II caII you back.
The I-90 construction's
way behind scheduIe...
...and the Times wants to know why
there's gridIock on the I-5.
TeII them it's God's way of saying,
'Listen to the radio.'
Did you read my proposaI?
-What'd you think?
-I Iiked it.
You'II have to move it past Stu.
After Iunch.
Okay. After Iunch.
-Ted, what's up?
-Making music with my fingers.
And what a beautifuI sound it is.
Linda PoweII, Steve Dunne.
Yeah, I met you 61 hours ago.
That was me.
Listen, want to get some dinner?
Busy.
How about some Iunch?
Have a Iunch. Coffee?
Water?
How about some water?
I'II meet you where you're having Iunch
and we'II have some...
...water.
I think this whoIe decade
wiII have to be about cIeaning up.
Our project spent Iast year
studying the AIaskan Exxon spiII.
And now with...
...aII the Exxon kickbacks and...
...things....
God, yes!
The worst!
I'm trying to put together
a group in June...
...to study the whoIe coast.
But I'm having a IittIe troubIe
getting a boat.
I think it wiII work out fine.
What?
There's just no privacy anymore.
I thought he was going to swaIIow her.
-Me too.
-My God!
Do you know what time it is?
-3:30.
-I'm so Iate!
-I'm gIad your Iunch date didn't show up.
-Me too.
-Did you reaIIy have a Iunch date?
-No.
-So you want to--
-I'm getting over somebody.
-I reaIIy think it's a bad time.
-Maybe I'II-- Okay.
Here's my car.
Let me give you a ride back to work.
Thanks.
Thanks.
I reaIIy Iike your take
on the supertrain.
It's ambitious.
If it were up to me....
She opened my car door button.
Unmistakable sign.
I like this girl.
Got to handle this one really well.
The thing I Iike best about you...
...is that you reaIIy Iisten to me.
You're a reaIist-sIash-dreamer.
Thanks.
I get so pissed off
when I think about it.
That some jerk couId
trash the Mona Lisa...
...or an ocean...
...or someone's Iife!
Who are your neighbors?
That's BaiIey, right there.
He's a maitre d' .
He keeps us aII in free meaIs.
On the corner there...
...that's Debbie Hunt.
She actuaIIy consumes men
instead of food.
And that is CIiff.
He deIivers fIowers, has four jobs...
...works in the coffee shop
around the corner.
Upstairs is Janet Livermore.
She works there too.
She's saving up for architecture schooI.
CIiff and Janet....
That's it.
You sound Iike me
taIking about my famiIy.
Want to go upstairs
whiIe your stuff is drying?
That's a good picture of you.
Let me ask you a question.
Do you think about traffic, ever?
Because I do.
ConstantIy. Traffic is caused
by the singIe-car driver.
900,000 singIe peopIe get
in their cars every morning...
...they drive to work and they wonder
why there's gridIock.
But if you had a train...
...a supertrain, you give the peopIe
a reason to get out of their cars.
You give them great coffee,
great music...
...they wiII park and ride.
I know they wiII.
I stiII Iove my car, though.
The Sonics.
They got a good team this year.
Good thing they traded Xavier McDanieI.
What is he?
-A boxer or a basketbaII pIayer?
-You dare to rip the X-man.
'IKiss at the HoteI De ViIIe.'
You have this too. I have this.
And aIbums.
I miss aIbums.
-I was a DJ in coIIege.
-ReaIIy?
That's why I stiII have records.
Any boyfriends?
You don't want to know.
I've had bad Iuck.
But there was this one guy.
Rich.
AII my girIfriends Ioved him.
AII that stuff I toId you about
the money I inherited?
I made that up.
PIus, I got back together
with Lynn Iast night...
...so you probabIy want
to go ahead and freak out.
It was Iike a professionaI hit.
I didn't want to get cIose
to anybody for a Iong time.
And then I--
-I'm taIking too much.
-No, go ahead.
I thought for sure I'd
meet someone in coIIege, you know?
A perfect combination of
MeI Gibson and HoIden CauIfieId.
And the SexuaI RevoIution wouId
just sweep us both away.
I was a semester too Iate.
Condoms.
They're free!
It's okay to Ioathe these peopIe.
ReaIIy?
There is so much Iife in you.
And so much...
...emotionaI Iarceny in these others.
I'm Andy.
I'm Linda.
'EmotionaI Iarceny'?
He said passion didn't matter
as much as comfort and stabiIity.
-That's buIIshit.
-No kidding!
Sorry.
It's cooI.
We Iived together for 2 years.
We're stiII friends but--
I did the same thing.
It's Iike one day...
...one of you goes for groceries
and never comes back.
Everyone I know
wants everything to be easy.
I know.
Why'd I have to meet you in a cIub?
I don't know.
I Iove this song.
My cIothes!
Is this you?
This gas-guzzIing monster is you?
The environmentaIist?
-I inherited it from my dad.
-I'm not sure how I feeI about that.
Let's maybe do something
this weekend or--
Okay.
-I'II caII you.
-Don't forget.
I won't.
Good night.
Listen, next time, why don't you...
...park underground.
I shouId go.
I was just...
...nowhere near your neighborhood.
Burglar.
Burglar.
Neighbors!
It's Andy, calling to
make sure you're okay.
-She's okay.
-I thought about the talk we had.
I think you shouId trust him.
AIthough I think...
...he's putting on the moves.
I'm a guy.
I know these things.
I don't like that I know them
but I know them.
And I like that he's a Steve.
But be careful.
If he doesn't treat you right...
...I'll kick his ass.
Can you wait?
Just a IittIe Ionger.
Whenever! Whenever!
You're amazing.
I feeI Iike I'm being puIIed inside you.
Are we being too Ioud?
What are you thinking...
...right now?
I just go out and pIay good,
hard-nosed basketbaII.
Things happen throughout the game.
It's nothing you can do.
I don't go out and say I'II
to beat this or that guy up.
Anything eIse, X?
Steve, don't come yet.
God!
I'm in love with my neighbor.
Why don't you call me, Cliff?
What can I eat?
I'm tired of starving myself
for this guy.
Salad!
I'll have a salad.
If I call him that's being desperate.
He's late or he forgot.
I refuse to remind him he forgot.
If he shows up, I'll listen.
But no way do I call him.
Of course, men do like to be called.
I'll call him in 1 0 minutes.
That will be one hour and
that is officially very late.
He is officially very late.
If I make this basket,
that's fate telling me to call him.
Two out of three.
Wait!
Did no basket mean call him or don't
call him?
Busy. That's a sign.
Fate says don't call.
Forget it.
I'm not desperate.
I have many, many people
to spend a Saturday with.
Stop getting invoIved with your neighbors.
-Is that what broke us up?
-We're better as friends.
The thing about CIiff is...
...he has aII this fierce integrity.
Except when it comes to women.
He Iikes...
...these cIub-type women.
These huge, hourgIass Amazon women.
I think it's great you're together
but protect yourseIf.
So I'm not an Amazon woman?
You're from the high pIains.
I'm so gIad I Iive here.
Are my breasts too smaII?
God!
Because, I mean...
...I Iook around
and aII I see are these...
...posters and biIIboards
and magazines...
...and TV shows aII with
these women with huge breasts.
And I guess...
...I just wanted to ask,
is that what men reaIIy want?
I mean, is that what you want?
You know?
Don't Iie, because your eye twitches
and I'II know.
Ask me.
Are my breasts too smaII?
Sometimes.
Have you had impIants before?
What do you think?
No.
You take a coupIe of days
and make up your mind.
We skew the size specificaIIy
to what you want...
...by graph, right.
WeII, what's painfuI?
It can be miIdIy painfuI and certainIy
safety is on everybody's mind...
...mine in particuIar.
Right.
Take a coupIe of days and
think about it. AII right.
Heard you on the phone. I'm in.
I don't need a coupIe of days.
How about...
...that?
Maybe for your frame,
something a IittIe Iess...
...hourgIass.
I think if you're going to
have the operation...
...have the operation.
Do you jog?
A IittIe.
Maybe....
SpIit the difference?
SpIit the difference.
Hi, it's me.
I'm tired of doing the right thing...
...waiting for you to caII me.
I'm on the bed right now...
...wearing something reaIIy outrageous.
I've got no underwear on.
I need to be touched.
I'm burning for you, CIiff.
I think you got the wrong number,
but I'II be right over.
This guy pIays no games.
That's great!
I've got to pIay this one perfectIy.
Go with it.
What do your instincts teII you?
Not to Iisten to you guys.
She doesn't want you
tugging at her bra strap.
She wants mystery.
She wants drama.
She wants excitement.
I know women.
I don't want drama.
I don't want excitement.
I want to trust him.
ShouId I trust him?
Not aII guys are Iike Luiz.
You're right.
You're right.
Steve is different.
WiII you just foIIow your instincts?
Don't treat this Iike casuaI sex.
CasuaI sex doesn't even exist anymore.
It's IethaI. It's over.
What are you thinking?
If I had a conversation with God,
I'd ask him to create this girI.
My chest hurts.
You didn't Ieave a note, did you?
I Ieft my bIue T-shirt by mistake.
There are no mistakes!
What's that mean?
Give me the phone.
I'm going to caII my new...
...semi-girIfriend.
You don't reaIize.
You'II scare her off.
She's beautifuI.
Anyone wouId caII her.
You distinguish yourseIf
by not caIIing her.
P.S. That's how you get her.
BaiIey, you don't understand.
Remember your Iast 3 girIfriends?
You're right.
I got to Iet this one breathe.
You're concerned about dioxins.
I'II give you Greenpeace's number.
How'd it go?
I got the boat.
Trip to AIaska's set.
Great, Linda! That's great!
Steve on 2.
Four days he waits to caII me.
What do I teII him?
I went for groceries.
She went for groceries.
He's coming over.
'Nothing'?
Nothing is wrong.
ReaIIy.
-I thought we connected.
-This is a reaIIy smaII office.
-Is this because I didn't caII?
-I don't remember. Did you caII?
Why are you being Iike this?
I Iike you. It was cooI meeting you.
I'II caII you or you caII me.
Look, I'm sorry if I bIew it
by not caIIing you.
You don't owe me.
You don't have to caII me.
Is it that oId boyfriend
who aIways caIIs?
He doesn't aIways caII.
-He probabIy has a ponytaiI.
-No.
He's Mr. Sensitive PonytaiI Man.
He's not Mr. Sensitive PonytaiI Man.
You're scared to get cIose to me.
You don't know me enough to say that.
-I think I do.
-No, you don't.
Let's not pIay games.
If I was pIaying games I'd have
waited a week to caII.
What I mean is--
I got to work, Steve.
-Bye, Steve.
-I Ieft my T-shirt at your--
Why?
Why do you talk such a good game?
You talk about things that matter...
...that get me excited, that get me hot.
Then it's like...
...you're lobotomized.
Why can't I just protect myself?
Why can't I just...
...be a buddy?
Glad I caught this one in time.
Can't leave myself open.
Better to be the dumper
than the dumpee.
Listen, Mom, if he
invited you to Hawaii, yes...
...he probabIy wants something.
And who cares?
Dad's been gone for 2 years.
Listen. Listen, Mom!
Look, Debbie.
I'm having a bad sugar crash.
CouId you just hoId it down?
Wait a second.
Rinse off your dishes
before you put them in the dishwasher.
I rinsed them.
No, you have to rinse off aII the food
or it gets over everything.
I found this big IittIe
chunky thing on my gIass.
No biggie.
Wish me Iuck on my video
for Expect the Best.
This is for Expect the Best?
I brought some cIippings,
some possibIe Iooks for my video.
Here we have the Edie Sedgwick.
You know?
Pseudo-Brigitte Bardot.
Or we jet on over to Spain
for the depressed miIIionairess.
And...
...I Iove these earrings
that nobody Ioves but me.
Truth?
Truth.
I wiII create your new Iook.
I wiII have men dying at your feet.
$ 1 0 extra...
...and Brian wiII shoot your video.
20.
He doesn't even know me.
Debbie...
...he is onIy, Iike,
the next Martin Scorcese.
I'm in your hands.
I am Debbie Hunt.
If you want to see how I look
rewind and freeze frame.
But I am not about...
...looks.
I crave responsibility,
respectability and love.
My goals are serenity and knowledge...
...and men who can understand me.
No druggies, please.
I'm fairly intense.
And I'm an advertising exec...
...at KRWE-TV.
That's me!
Come to where the flavor is.
Come to Debbie Country.
'Debbie Country.'
It's funny.
'Doghouse.'
It shouId be 6 or 7 songs.
-They want me to come out.
-Stone's right. They're friends.
'Doghouse' as an encore, man.
You can't start off with that.
Why make those peopIe cIap,
so we come out again?
You don't get it, do you, man?
Check out this review of our record.
Read it out Ioud.
'Once again, when CIiff Poncier sings--'
Wait a minute. I don't want
to hear anything negative.
Go on.
'He was abIy backed by Stone,
Jeff and drummer Eddie Vedder.'
That's a good review.
A compIiment for us
is a compIiment for you.
No, man.
This negative energy
just makes me stronger.
We wiII not retreat.
This band is unstoppabIe!
This weekend, we rock PortIand.
I know you're in Iove,
but are you sure you want to do this?
My mind is made up.
Want to read a magazine?
Thanks for doing this with me.
Didn't want you to go aIone.
TeII me, what do you
reaIIy want from a guy?
When I first moved here from Tucson...
...I wanted a guy with...
...Iooks...
...security...
...caring...
...someone with their own pIace.
Someone who said 'bIess you'
or ' gesundheit ' when I sneezed.
And someone who Iiked
the same things as me, but not exactIy.
Someone who Ioves me.
TaII order.
I scaIed it down a IittIe.
What is it now?
Someone who says
' gesundheit ' when I sneeze.
Though I prefer 'bIess you.'
It's nicer.
Sorry you had to wait.
This is my friend Steve.
Dr. Jamison.
Come on in.
Last chance.
Here we go.
I'm going to say something that
I haven't said to any patients...
...in 3 years of being at HMO.
I wiII perform the operation
but I don't think you need it.
I think you're perfect.
I think if your boyfriend doesn't
appreciate you the way you are...
...then you have to ask,
are you his Miss Right...
...or are you his Miss Maybe?
What's that mean?
Did my check bounce?
I reaIIy have a feeIing about you.
Thanks but...
...I Iove my boyfriend.
I stiII feeI good about
saying what I said.
You shouId. It's good!
Can I say something to you?
Sure.
Your face wants a different part.
-You know, your hair.
-My hair?
There you go!
Now you Iook vagueIy rocking.
I mean, come on.
You're a happening guy, you know?
You're Dr. Jamison.
You've got...
...nice eyes. And you've got those
great, trustworthy eyebrows.
And you're a surgeon, man!
Many, many babes are into that.
No, reaIIy!
Listen, I have friends
who wouId Iove you.
I don't know how to have fun, right?
I'm 33 years oId and
I don't know how to have fun.
There.
Now was that fun or what?
Yeah. That was fun.
Doc?
And now with the operation.
I want CIiff to Iike me the way I am.
Thanks.
A few days later, she leaves the hive.
Now she's ready to mate.
So PortIand, maybe it wasn't our city.
Where are the anthems of our youth?
What happened to music
that meant something?
The Who at the IKingdome
or IKiss at the CoIiseum?
Where is the 'Misty Mountain Hop'?
Where is the 'Smoke on the Water'
or the 'Ironman' of today?
We're not going out tonight,
are we, honey?
Look at this. These bands are Iike
weII-designed bottIes of bIeach.
It's beer-and-IifestyIe music.
I mean, it's Iike the next worId war
is going to be sponsored by....
I don't know. What?
We couId just take a bath.
Just remember one thing.
We are Ioved in BeIgium and in ItaIy.
The yellow jacket wasp
has come looking for food.
The alarm has sounded.
They pour into the European hive.
Hey, babe, don't get me sick.
I'm pIaying this weekend.
Wait a minute.
What am I doing?
I don't have to be here.
I could just break up with him.
I have always been able to do this.
Break up with someone
and never look back.
Being alone.
There's a certain dignity to it.
Did I overreact?
You know who this is?
We spent a couple
of great weeks together.
But my mind works in strange ways.
When things are at their best,
I wait for them to fall apart.
I can't figure out
if I do it to myself...
...or if life does it for me.
I'm a IittIe Iate this month,
that's aII I'm saying.
How Iate?
Late.
Steve Dunne.
Doug HughIey.
Mr. Deegan's cIass.
What is up, you oId goat?!
-How you doing?
-Okay, man.
You know how much homework
I missed because of you?
I Ioved your radio show.
That was the best.
Thanks, man.
We're throwing down tonight
over on AIoha Street.
We got 2 bands.
It'II be insane!
WouId you get up and do a IittIe
'WheeIs of SteeI'?
Are you sure?
You're the onIy one who can mix up
EIvis CosteIIo and PubIic Enemy.
What's so funny about
Peace peace peace?
Love and under--
Death Row
What does a brother understand?
You're the best.
You are the king.
You are the king!
You've got to be there, man.
You must be there!
Of course, you may be busy.
Ten more minutes and we pour X into B
and if it's bIue--
Then we have a big taIk.
-I have some time right now.
-Then Iet's taIk right now.
-My body knows it'II be bIue.
-It won't be bIue.
I've never gotten anybody pregnant.
It won't be bIue.
I'm probabIy steriIe.
A famiIy trait.
ReaIIy?
Do you know where my other shoes are?
Maybe they're by the door.
That'd be wiId.
-What?
-Having a kid.
-If you were pregnant.
-If I were.
Which I'm not.
And I wouIdn't expect you
to deaI with it anyway.
I'd be with you.
We'd deaI with it.
To friendship.
That's bIuish, right?
It's fairIy bIue.
Oh, weII.
Wait. Put it against
something bIue, though.
Wait. Let's try and put it
against something white.
-So what are you doing today?
-Not much.
I got to meet the deputy mayor
to see the mayor.
-Good. I have stuff to do too.
-So you can caII me.
CaII you or....
-And finaIIy...
-Interesting!
...if we can get the singIe-car driver
onto the supertrain...
...we can change the city.
It's aII in the proposaI.
FIirts with briIIiance.
Wish it were up to me.
Let me get you 1 5 minutes
with the mayor.
Thank you.
So basicaIIy, that's kind of
what we're aII about...
...give or take a IittIe.
I'd Iike to just kind of
Ieave it up to you at this point.
I think that wiII be great.
I think you've expIained it reaIIy weII.
These are the men who want me.
But I'm more than just a good body.
Feelings, man!
I have a lot of
tender feelings which are...
...just waiting for the right woman.
It's hard to get it across
when you look like this, obviously.
My name is Spiro. I'm an artist.
As you can see, my painting
is displayed behind me.
I'm the kind of person that's really...
...meticulous in appearance,
and also very precise.
In fact, if two people
really believe in each other...
...that love can go around the world
and through each other's soul.
But love is a very delicate thing.
In fact, if you're both not careful
and nurturing, that love can....
I'm looking for a woman
who is unpredictable.
Someone who is complex.
Someone who is willing to experiment.
I like the way the world
looks from a bicycle.
I guess I'm just looking for someone
who feels the same way I do.
About a bicycle.
Am I coming off as too intense?
I can be intensely laid back too.
I am very...
...very...
...very lonely.
Who?
DefiniteIy the bicycIe guy.
The bicycIe guy.
He's, Iike, your souI mate.
Guy with the bicycIe.
Nice outfit.
Is he Iate?
Yeah, but...
...I expect the best.
So why did you pick this Sea Merchant?
The First Avenue one is way happening.
You mean there's another Sea Merchant?
The new one.
On your right!
Excuse me.
Was a Jamie here Iooking
for a Debbie Hunt?
Yes, and he Ieft you a message:
I got your address from Expect the Best.
Meet you at your house.
Great!
He was hot!
Desperation.
It's the world's worst cologne.
-You're good at that.
-It's the key to popcorn.
SwirI with the bowI.
Let's put the bowI down.
Let's make some more.
AII right.
Are you okay? I'm sorry.
More popcorn!
Want more popcorn!
Stop, stop, stop.
-You want more?
-How does it work?
-Do you want butter?
-Do I want butter?
Yeah. You represent weII
in reaI Iife.
Thanks a Iot. So do you.
Thank you.
When I missed you at Sea Merchant...
...I buzzed over on my EIite
and I ran into Pammy!
-Pammy from U-Dub.
-PameIa. I'm PameIa now.
Oh, you're PameIa.
Did you see that package
out on the porch for you?
No. Jamie and I made popcorn.
We're making popcorn here with IKermit.
I'd Iove to show you
this package on the porch.
Just one second.
Sure.
First off, we aIways said
separate Iives.
-It's no biggie.
-It's a major biggie!
I knew him first!
So that gives you the right
to just bone him in my kitchen!
If I wanted that guy,
I wouIdn't need a video date to get him.
No, you'd just wait for me to meet him
and then make popcorn!
I wiII make popcorn
with whomever I want to.
You've made popcorn
with haIf of the city!
At Ieast I don't have to
chase the popcorn.
I don't think we shouId take
this vacation together.
You toId me to teII you
when you're being pIastic.
You're being pIastic.
This is so unfair.
How much do you want for him?
$ 200.
-Outrageous!
-That's what I paid.
-$ 75.
-$ 1 50.
$80 and I'II do dishes aII month.
DeaI!
Fine!
-We need to taIk.
-I think we do.
There's something I need to say.
-You want out.
-Let's get married.
Everyone around us is together
for the wrong reasons.
Or they baiI out.
This is Iife teIIing us something.
-Oh, God!
-What?
Don't make me remember
this chiIi dog forever.
Remember it.
Make that a historic chiIi dog.
Take your time.
Think about it.
You don't even have to use words.
Just take a bite if the answer is yes.
I want to be IogicaI about this.
Say we're married, we have the kid.
WiII we be anything Iike we are now?
It's reaIIy the great unknown.
PIus I've got work.
I've got that AIaska trip,
you've got your thing.
I want to be IogicaI.
I think I can Iove you
and stiII be IogicaI.
What?
What is that Iook?
Someone who reaIIy cares about you.
It must scare you to death.
Forget Iogic.
What's in your heart?
I want to do it.
I think this is Iife
teIIing us something.
So that's a yes?
You're going to feeI good about this.
ReaIIy?
Mom, I want to get out!
Why can't we get out?
Did we make the right decision?
I don't know.
Xavier aImost made the AII-Star team.
He fights pIayers
who are better than him.
-Like?
-Like CharIes BarkIey.
That is a Bobby Van.
Who?
The host of Make Me Laugh.
I never got to finish that chiIi dog.
That Iight's on yeIIow way too Iong.
You okay?
You aII right?
I'm fine.
Are you aII right?
Are you aII right?
Let's get out.
Come on, Iet's get out.
James.
James.
Who's James?
I don't know.
Honey.
James Worthy is a star.
X is just a pIayer.
Is this from an earIier conversation?
Good sign.
We had an accident, baby.
You're in the hospitaI.
I Iost it, right?
It's aII over.
If we can't make it through this...
...if you don't know
you're not aIone....
I Iost the baby.
WiII you Iook at me?
I was flunking out of high school.
I was 45 pounds overweight,
had a dead-end job, a beat-up car.
I didn't feel good about myself.
My future did not look very bright.
How are you doing today?
I'm better.
I think I've read every singIe
magazine in the worId.
-Did you go to work today?
-No, I didn't.
It's been 2 weeks.
I think they're going to fire me.
I need some time aIone.
AIone?
I have a new emotion every five seconds.
I think I shouId go ahead
and take that research trip.
I shouId just be out somewhere
in the middIe of the ocean.
AIone.
I know I'm right about this.
It's just a month.
It's just work.
See you in a month!
I'II miss you!
Janet!
I got a present for you.
Give me another chance.
One, two minutes.
Come on.
This'II be great.
You're going to Iove me for this.
I instaIIed your new stereo.
Great!
I'II repIace the windows.
Thanks.
Work.
Work has never been better.
I miss her.
What will we say to each other
when she gets back?
-WeIcome back.
-You Iook great.
You too.
How are you?
How was it?
It was reaIIy good.
ReaIIy good.
You want to go home
or out somepIace?
I couId do either.
Can you think of a pIace?
There's Costa's, I guess.
Or whatever.
The 3-2-1 ?
-No, Costa's aII right.
-I don't reaIIy care.
Jesus!
The pressure in the air couId sink us.
I know.
I reaIIy got into my job again.
I did too.
I've been working my ass off.
I had the Coast Guard working for us.
It was reaI exciting.
That's great.
We don't have to try
and be what we were.
Thanks.
I've been thinking the same thing.
Great.
Friends.
Let's be the first peopIe in history
to say it and mean it.
You aIways say the perfect thing.
That obnoxious mime...
...was right.
Love disappears.
Let's go, man!
Let's go!
We got peopIe out here!
I got to go piss, man!
Let's go!
Linda.
It's me.
I had to caII you.
It's about midnight.
I was having many beers...
...and I wanted to say...
...what I shouId have said at the dock.
I fucking chickened out.
I Iied when I acted casuaI,
Iike Mr. CasuaI...
...and I shouId have said it!
You beIong...
...with...
...me!
We beIong together.
It pissed me off that, now that
we're talking, you thought...
...I proposed to you onIy because
you were pregnant!
I've got to go piss!
This is not the bathroom!
Maybe if I'd said some of
these things at the dock...
...it wouId've made a difference.
I think we made a big mistake.
We had good times and bad times...
...but we had times.
And I wouId Iike to start over.
I wouId Iike to be new to you.
I want to be new to you.
I want to be Mr. New.
CaII me back if you want.
This is the Iast time I'II caII.
If you reaIIy needed to know
how I reaIIy feeI...
...that's how I feeI. I Iove you.
That's something you shouId know.
I won't bother you again.
Good night and goodbye.
I Iove you. CaII me back.
Goodbye.
This thing just eats tapes.
So uItimateIy we're taIking about...
...900,000 to a miIIion peopIe
by the time it's done...
...most of them singIe-car drivers.
We provide a better and safer
environment than their cars.
Why can't it work, Mr. Mayor?
So it's a train.
A supertrain.
I've been burned by this
train business before.
You peopIe aII seem to forget.
We can change this city.
PeopIe Iove their cars.
But if you give them great coffee...
...and great music. If you--
I'II put it to you Iike this...
...then I'II thank you
for your time.
My answer is...
...no.
Hi, may I heIp you?
One ticket to Cabo San Lucas...
...through Los AngeIes,
first cIass, pIease.
CouId you seat me next to a singIe guy?
I think I'II put you in seat 3-C.
Thank you.
TeII me everything there is
to know about you.
I've got a speciaI feeIing about you.
Don't feeI too bad about her.
I'II teII you what happened.
The kid taIks her ear off
the whoIe fIight.
His dad picks him up at the airport.
He's divorced. He meets Debbie.
His first words are....
Look at those fantastic earrings.
And that's all it took.
Debbie was in love.
She got back 2 weeks ago. He sends
her the big basket every day.
Every third one she sends back
just to be mysterious.
I don't know. Games.
He wants her to move to Mexico.
And if she gets a job at the
TV station there, she's going.
Thanks.
Tomorrow I sneak in and speII
her name in rose petaIs.
Do you beIieve this job?
It's so easy to fall back
into old patterns.
Back with Andy.
One week and we're already
like one of those...
...old couples who sit around in
Denny's and don't speak.
What am I doing?
Why did I chicken out?
You have the....
No.
This is good.
Being with Andy is like being alone.
Together.
At least I'm not out there dating.
Love you.
Love you too.
What?
I was worried about you.
I'm fine.
I am great!
Been working.
I read haIf of Exodus.
I think you're going through
a phase of some kind.
Do you reaIize that
in modern-day society...
...there is aImost no need
to Ieave the house?
At aII.
You're wigging.
I'm not wigging.
What? You think I'm wigging?
This is hang time.
I'm just....
I'm just regrouping.
I'm spending some time with myseIf.
Getting stronger. Regrouping.
Thinking about regrouping.
I'm thinking about how I Iistened
to my instincts and they were wrong.
Wrong. The opposite of right.
I just wanted to bring you your maiI.
You know...
...and maybe this isn't the
right time to say this...
...but things do turn around.
I mean, I don't even think
about CIiff anymore.
I'm having the best time ever.
On my terms.
And you know what eIse?
I'm going back to schooI.
ReaIIy?
Paid off my Ioan.
Got aII my cIasses.
My first project is
to redesign the fountain...
...so we can sit in it.
That's good news.
It is.
PeopIe need peopIe.
It has nothing to do with sex.
Maybe 40 percent.
60 percent.
Forget it. Forget it.
TeII you what:
If I have any kind of news
of any kind...
...something good...
...something nice...
...that I want to share with you
or something...
...I wiII knock four times, okay?
It's going to be...
...our secret code.
How?
-What?
-How?
-How what?
-How wiII you knock?
Like that.
Take care of yourseIf.
PIease.
In a paraIIeI universe,
we're probabIy a scorching coupIe.
But in this one...
...neighbors.
Did you get my message Iast night?
Because I caIIed.
I know.
I thought I appreciated you
but I didn't.
I used to...
...Iive out by the airport
underneath the fIight patterns.
It was noisy with the pIanes
going by aII day.
I used to have cookouts
and no one wouId come...
...because of the noise.
I got used to it.
And then, when I moved,
I missed the noise.
I missed the pIanes.
What are you taIking about?
I don't know.
I miss you.
The way you used to Iook at me.
Don't.
I'm finaIIy over you.
ReaIIy?
I mean, you know,
I stiII reaIIy do Iike you.
You know?
I think you're very....
What?
Entertaining.
That's me. I got to go.
My break's over.
Janet, you rock my worId.
I'm walking down the avenue
And I'm looking at the garbage cans
I'm laughing at the people I see
Something like that.
I'm just playing with the lyrics.
None of that stuff is set in stone.
Anyway, I'm working on it.
Call me when you get in.
I don't know
what you're doing tonight.
But give me a call.
TaIk to me, taIk to me.
40 résumés, bring me back something.
Here we go!
I was just nowhere near
your neighborhood.
I don't need to be your girIfriend.
I just want to know you again.
What took you so Iong?
I was stuck in traffic.
That's the way it happens around here.
Steve's moving out,
they're finding their own pIace.
-I'm happy for them.
-Look out!
No probIem.
I may Iive here forever and that's fine.
Not everybody needs to be with someone.
I don't know, for a Iot of peopIe,
Iiving aIone is a nasty hang.
Not for me.
My music is aII the juice I'II need.
I'm a seIf-contained unit.
I'm a soIo artist.
I better get going.
I'm going out tonight.
Going out?
You?
That's a nice hat you're wearing.
And I don't mean that
in an Eddie HaskeII kind of way.
Thanks.
-BIess you.
-Thank you.
Does everyone go through this?
No, I think just us.
I'll be celibate forever.
I could spend the rest of my life
with that girl.
She's in a car.
All you see is her head.
-I know my type.
-I met someone new.
-She's more my type than yours.
-She is not.
-She is.
-You always say they're your type.
