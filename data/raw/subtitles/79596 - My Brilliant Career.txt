"Dear Fellow Countrymen,
'Just a few lines to let you know...
"that this story is going
to be all about me.
"So, in answer to many requests,
"here is the story of my career.

"Here is the story...
"of my career.
"My...
"brilliant career.
"I... make...
"no apology...
"for being...
"egotistical,

"because I am.
Hmm.

"I have always known...

"that I belonged...

[ Dog Barking ]
Go on, then. Take that in the house
for Mother.
Go on!
Get in the house!

Sybylla, I want to have
a talk with you.
Talk away.
You're a young woman now,
and-
I have been thinking about this
a great deal.
We can't afford to keep you
any longer.
Do you think you could
earn your own living?
Of course.
And how would you do that?
I'd like to be a pianist.
Oh, Sybylla.
That takes years of practice.
You know we can't afford it. You've thought
of something already, haven't you?
I've arranged a position for you.
A position?
As a general servant.
Servant?
I won't.
We have no choice.
You just want to get rid of me.
I must do what I feel is right!
Oh, I prayed to God
for guidance.
And this is what
he told you to do?
God be damned!
[ Door Slams ]
It's a wonder God didn't
strike her dead at my feet.
Same as all your damned family.
Delusions of grandeur.
[ Sighs ]
To have such a daughter-
useless, plain and godless.
What can I do?
[ Dog Barking ]
I want to do great things, Gertie,
not be a servant.
I hate this life.
Should never have left
the mountains.
It's not Father's fault.
You can't blame him for the drought.
Gertie, don't you ever dream
there's more to life than this?
Don't you want to meet people
who talk about books and words...
and have visions?
Gertie, I can't settle
for a new dress,
a picnic now and then.
Living out in the bush for the rest of my life,
I might just as well be dead.
Don't say things like that.
Well, why doesn't Mother
understand?
Why doesn't anyone?
I think you're the nicest, cleverest girl
in the whole entire world.
I'm not.
I'm mad.
It'd be better if I didn't think at all.
[ Liquid Squirting ]
[ Thinking ]
It's no use for me.
I've no training, no money.
I haven't any time
to study or practice.
Just two states of existence-
work and sleep.
[ Mother ]
Sybylla!
[ Sighs ]
Sybylla, why do you never answer
when I call?
I want you to fetch your father.
[ Moos ]
It's all right.
I'll do it.
[ Men Chattering, Faint ]
[ Chattering Continues ]
[ Bartender ]
Looking for your dad, are ya?
Just missed him.
Left with the schoolmaster.
[ Man ]
Blind leading the blind!
[ Men Laughing ]
[ Man ]
As usual!
Come on.
Hup! Hup! Come on.
[ Chickens Clucking ]
I've had a letter
from your grandmother.
You'd better read it!
Says she's sorry to hear you're such a source
of grief and annoyance...
and thinks you might be in danger
of forming ties beneath you here.
Oh, Syb, you're to go
to Gran at Caddagat!
[ Both Laughing ]
Gertie!
[ Barking ]
Good day!
Good day, Jack! How are ya?
[ Chattering ]
[ Barking Continues ]
Go on.
Good day, Bill!
Good day, Jack.
Had a good trip?
Fine, Bill, just fine.
Not a bad run at all.
[ Chattering, Indistinct ]
I say, driver.
Yes, sir?
I believe Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter
was supposed to have been on the coach.
Oh! That's me!
Thank you, Jack.
- Hello.
- Miss Melvyn?
Yes. Where's Uncle J.J.?
Um, he's away.
On business.
I'm Frank Hawden.
- What are you?
- Ajackaroo.
[ Chuckles ]
That's poetry.
Yes.
[ Clears Throat ]
Thank you.
[Jack ]
See you next week, then.
[ Woman ] Bye.
Bye-bye, Jack!
Bye, missy.
Go on.
[ Dogs Barking ]
[ Woman ]
Bye!
You're a new chum, aren't you?
Certainly not.
I've been in the colony
well over three months.
Oh.
Still wet behind the ears.
I was surprised back there...
at your being
Mrs. Bossier's granddaughter.
Really?
Yes.
I mean, you're not at all like them,
Mrs. Bossier or your aunt, Mrs. Bell.
They're so awfully
good-looking.
Indeed!
Yes.
But never mind.
You seem like a good sort.
We'll have some fun.
Well, I'm glad
I meet with your approval,
Mr. Hawden,
in even a small degree.
[ Chuckles ]
Caddagat!
[ Dog Barking ]
[ Barking Continues ]
[ Frank ]
Hello! We're here!
Sybylla!
Welcome, my dear!
Welcome!
Oh, Grandma.
Sybylla.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Giggles ]
Oh!
I remember this!
[ Chuckles ]
Oh!
[ Clears Throat ]
For the gracious bounties
we are about to receive...
may the good Lord
make us truly thankful.
Amen.
[ All ]
Amen.
[ Clears Throat ]
Hmm.
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Take some more, dear.
Will this be sufficient for you, Frank?
Yes, thank you.
Thank you, Mrs. Bossier.
Ah.
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Helen, have you seen any patterns
in the catalog you like?
Well, there were two, yes.
Yes, I bought two lovely ones for Sybylla.
That's a good idea.
What color, do you think?
Oh, sky blue.
Or pretty pink?
And what would you like,
Sybylla?
Lemon.
# [ Piano ]
# [ Ends ]
Thank you, dear.
[ Laughing ]
But, Helen,
you look so beautiful.
Don't you recognize
your own mother?
This was her room
when she was young.
We'll see you in the morning.
Sleep well.
Good night.
[ Door Closes ]
[ Dog Barking ]
[ Crying Quietly ]
[ Crying Continues ]
Ohh.
Now...
what's all this about?
[ Crying Continues ]
Mother-
[ Sniffles ]
Mother.
[ Chuckles ]
And I'm so ugly.
Nobody loves me.
Oh, Sybylla.
Stop all this
and into bed with you.
Come along.
I don't understand you,
Sybylla.
There's- There's any amount of love
and good in the world, you know.
But it doesn't just come to you.
You have to search for it.
[ Sniffling ]
Being misunderstood...
is a trial we must all bear.
You have a- a wildness of spirit
which is going to get you
into trouble all your life.
Mm-hmm.
So you must learn
to control it.
And try and cultivate
a little more feminine vanity.
Oh, I've given up.
Plain looks never stopped
anyone from being...
intelligent or witty or-
or making friends.
Being beautiful is...
no guarantee of success
in anything.
But it does help a little.
I have a plan.
You'll never make me more than middling ugly.
We'll see. But first of all,
no more looking in mirrors.
And no more thinking
about yourself.
Hmm?
Oh!
[ Growling ]
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine,
eighty,
eighty-one, eighty-two,
eighty-three, eighty-four,
eighty-five, eighty-six,

"I had a dove,
and the sweet dove died,
"and I could have thought
it died of grieving.
Oh, who could it grieve for?"
[ Continues, Faint ]
[ Thunder Rumbling ]
Oh!
Mr. Hawden!
Frank.
How terribly kind.
Not at all!
[ Chuckles ]

[ Thunder Rumbling ]
[ Sybylla ]
Rain! Ohh!
[ Gasping, Laughing ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Laughing ]
[ Sybylla Sneezes ]
Now you see the consequences
ofwild and extravagant behavior.
You'd have done the same ifyou hadn't
seen decent rain for over a year.
[ Chuckles ]
Well, a few days in bed
will keep you out of mischief.
Harry has brought you some apples
all the way from Five Bob Downs.
You remember
Harry, dear?
Oh, Podgy?
[ Chuckles ]
Sybylla! Harry and Miss Augusta
are the most important people in the district!
Too good for me then.
I'm only good for the local boy who has pimples and stinks.
I shall make quite sure
my granddaughter will never marry a man unworthy of her.
Don't worry.
I don't.
I'm not marrying anyone.
I'm going to have a career.
A career. What in?
Mmm, literature, music, art.
Maybe the opera.
I've not made up my mind yet.
I fear, Helen, we underestimated
her mother's problem.
I wish Julius were here.
She needs a man's hand.
Ethel.
Yes, ma'am?
[ Bird Squawking ]
Take this to the kitchen, please.

[ Irish Accent ] I'd be obliged to you, sir,
ifyou'd take yourself out of the way,
unless you want me foot
in your big, fat face.
[ Gasps ]
How about, um, a reward?
Let me go.
[ Grunts ]
You should be ashamed.
A gentleman like yourself...
peepin' and pryin'
on innocent girls.
You'll have me sacked,
you will.
What's your name?
Wouldn't you like to know!
Ah.
[ Chuckling ]
Hmm.
Ah, it's a picture, you are!
Can't I look now?
What do you think,
Biddy?
Well, ma'am, I don't think
the glass'll break.
[ All Laughing ]
Biddy!
I hope you can say something
to your Uncle Julius.
Uncle J.J.?
He's not here!
Mm-hmm.
Oh!
Thank you, Aunt Helen.
It's beautiful.
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Oh, Sybylla!
[ Man ]
There she is!
Uncle J.J.!
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ]
Here.
By George,
you're a good-looking young lady!
Ah. You've changed,
no doubt about that.
You haven't. Your kisses
still smell ofwhiskey and cigars.
That's what makes 'em irresistible.
[ Both Laughing ]
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Ah, come in, gentlemen!
Hello, Harry.
Hello, Mrs. Bossier.
I'm delighted you could join us this evening.
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Well, for goodness' sake, Frank, get him a drink!
Sybylla, this is our dear friend,
Harry Beecham.
Harry, you remember
my granddaughter.
Uh, y-yes, Miss Melvyn.
I...
never would have
recognized you.
No, nor I, Mr. Beecham.
I believe I have to thank you for the apples
you sent to me when I was ill.
And Frank's very good at giving me flowers.
Aren't you, Frank?
Y- Yes.
[ Clears Throat ]
Well, the drought up country's
not broken yet, Harry.
Saw a lot of unfortunate fellows
on the road heading south.
Yes, we've noticed more
calling in here for food recently.
Very bad. Very bad.
Yes, I was approached
by one of them today.
A very ill-mannered sort.
While I was picking blossom.
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Goodness, dear!
He was very forward.
He wanted to kiss me.
[ Frank ]
You should have called me.
I'd have taken care of him.
[ Chuckles ] I'm sure you would.
But I can look after myself, Frank.
[Julius ]
Good girl!
That's the sort we want.
Eh, Harry?
Absolutely.
[ Mrs. Bossier ]
Thank you, Ethel.
I fear Mrs. Hickey's decided that now is
an appropriate time to have her baby.
I promised to help.
Excuse me.
Mother, can't I go?
No, no, dear. No.
Enjoy yourselves.
Good night.
Good night, Mother.
Good night.
[ Door Closes ]
Sybylla.
Thank you.
[ Wine Pouring ]
[ Frank ]
Are you finished?
Would you like some more, Helen?
Yes. Thanks, Julius.
[ Wine Pouring ]
There you are, Harry.
Help yourself.

The only trouble is,
you don't know what she'll do next.
I seem to recall
she was always like this.

Ohh!
[ Chuckling ]
Sorry, Frank.
I loved it.
[ Applause ]
[ Sighs ]
From what I hear, Julius, last night
was little short of a bacchanalian debauch.
What?
Oh, who told you that, Mother?
Ask Helen.
She has one of her sick headaches.
[ Footsteps ]
Ah.
Sybylla.
Good morning, Grandma.
Good morning, Uncle J.J.
[Julius ]
Morning.
- Harry?
- He left early.
I gather your behavior
last night, young lady, left a lot to be desired.
[Julius ]
I'd have said Harry enjoyed himself.
That's not what I heard.
[ Frank ]
Excuse me.
Anyway, Syb solved
one problem last night.
Indeed.
Her future.
She should be
an actress.
Are you suggesting my granddaughter
should be an actress?
She has a talent for it.
I could introduce her-
Go on the stage?
I'd rather see her with her hair shorn off
and shut up in a convent.
Don't ever mention
the subject again.
[ Sheep Bleating ]
I enjoyed meself last night.
I thought we got on
jolly well together. Didn't you?
Miss Melvyn- Ahh!
Sybylla.
I've been thinking.
While looks aren't everything,
and, um-
Would you come
to the point, Frank?
Well, now that this-
this fellow Harry has gone,
you should pay some heed
to my attentions.
Do you mean your attentions
or your intentions?
At the conclusion of the coming year
I will be returning to England,
and I expect you
to return with me as my wife.
[ Snickering ]
Well, what do you say?
Oh, let me go.
Not until I have your answer.
[ Bleating Continues ]
Well, there is this in your favor-
You don't say you're sorry when you are not.
Why should I pretend
about a person like Frank Hawden?
But you are not prepared
to apologize?
What for?
Your aunt and I thought
that you liked him.
Liked him?
He appears to be
extremely fond ofyou.
[ Snickers ]
Now listen to me, Sybylla.
In a few years he'll come into
quite a large fortune in England.
He comes of a very good family
and will make someone an excellent husband.
Well, it won't be me!
Oh, do be realistic, child.
Well, I am!
To begin with,
I don't love him.
That is not the point.
Well, it is to me.
Sybylla, do you want to be
a burden on your family forever...
with no status in decent society
or a home ofyour own?
I will not be married off
to someone I detest, by you or anybody!
At times I fear for you, my girl.
You are rude to your elders and betters
and often lack all gentility.
Very well.
Though you may not be prepared
to apologize to Frank,
I expect you to apologize to me...
when you have regained
your... humor...
and your manners.
You must learn not to shout
at your grandmother, Sybylla.
I didn't mean to.
It just surges up in me
when she starts on about marriage.
She just doesn't seem
to understand.
Sit down here next to me.
Come on.
Now, believe me, Sybylla,
the best kind of marriage...
is not love marriage
but friendship marriage.
Friendship?
Yes.
You see,
your mother married for love.
And...
I too...
married for love.
My husband isn't dead.
He- He left me
for someone else.
Left me to live
the rest of my life with the-
the shame of being
neither wife nor widow...
nor maid.
But why should you
be ashamed?
Marriage gives us
respectability, dear, as you'll learn.
No, that is just
what men want us to believe.
Stupid idiots like-
like Frank Hawden.
Well, I won't be caught up in it,
not by him or anyone.
[ Sighs ]
Aunt Helen, please.
Please stop trying
to marry me off.
Well, I suppose I should...
tear up this invitation, then,
from Miss Augusta...
for you to stay a few days
at Five Bob.
Hmm?
Shall I?
[ Giggles ]
No!
[ Chuckles ]
I hear you've made a lot of changes
at Five Bob, Mr. Beecham.
Oh, yes, we have.
Must have been hard for you
when your father died.
Can I drive?
Whoa, boy, whoa.
Dear Lucy's daughter.
There's little resemblance.
No. I'm sorry.
A pity.
Well, come in.
Come along, child.
I'm not going to eat you.
[ Fire Crackling ]
[ Clock Ticking ]
[ Clears Throat ]
Well, I think I'll turn in.
Early start tomorrow.
Good night, Aunt Gussie.
Good night, dear.
Good night, Miss Melvyn.
Good night, Mr. Beecham.
He always seems so quiet
and composed.
You don't have to live with him.
This must be the most
beautiful house in the world.
Too big.
Too many corners to dust.
Fancy living in it, do you?
[ Chuckles ]
No. I'd get lost.
I wouldn't know what to do
with all those servants.
I wouldn't even know
what groceries to order.
I think another glass of port
won't harm us.
[ Birds Chirping, Squawking ]
[ Gussie ]
Beautiful creatures.
They're fortunate, aren't they?
Every day they get their food.
As long as I remember.
[ Exhales ]
They never have to look for water
in a dried-up creek,
scratch for a living...
like all our countrymen.
Forced on the road to beg.
Perhaps they are meant to
counterbalance the ugly things of life.
[ Chirping, Squawking Continue ]
Do you read the Australian poets,
Miss Gussie?
[ Sighs ]
You know, I think ugly girls should be
strangled at birth by their parents.
It's bad enough being born a girl,
but being born ugly and clever-
Oh. Clever, are you?
Well, I hope so.
I'm done for if I'm not.
Has to be something
I'm good at.
There's sure to be.
Cool breezes ripples
at the river below...
as fleecy clouds float high...
and I mark how
the dark green gum trees match...
the bright blue vault of the sky.
We wouldn't be out of place
on the Thames in England.
I haven't done this for years.
[ Gasping ]
Oh!
Sybylla!
[ Gasping ]
[ Coughing ]
[ Gasping Continues ]
[ Both Panting ]
Race you home!
You didn't stay long
at the river.
[ Sighs ]
You washed your hair.
That will never dry by dinner.
Perhaps I should cut it all off.
Well, no, dear.
It'd be a pity to lose
your finest asset.
My only asset,
more like.
Oh, I wouldn't go
quite as far as that.
Hmm.
It must be contagious.
What's that?
Washing one's hair.
Or did you, by chance,
have an accident at the river?
No, no. I don't wish
to hear the details.
Well, as you both seem able
to entertain yourselves,
I'll see to dinner.
I was worried when I couldn't see you
when I came to the surface.
I thought
you might have drowned.
[ Chuckles ]
What a terrible loss to the world.
Yes, it would have been.

Yes, a little faster.
Very good.

We'll have to watch her, Helen.
She'll give away half of Caddagat to those fellows.
[ Laughing ]
Can't something be done for them?
You see?
She'd carve up the place
among them and send me on the wallaby.
Frank. And make sure Butler
gives you the right gauge ofwire this time. Hmm?
Of course, Mr. Bossier.
Hmm.
There's our acceptance
for the ball, and make sure you give it to Harry.
Harry. Harry Beecham?
He's back?
[ Frank ]
Oh, yes. Has been
for a couple ofweeks.
[ Grandmother ] That's all
the mail, unless you have
anything to add.
Um, can I take it?
Well, I don't suppose Frank
would mind a passenger.
- Oh, I'd like to go by myself.
- Not on your life, Syb. Not with those horses.
Strange that Harry's not been over.
Can't have much time for you.
Excuse me.
Don't go through the gate.
Hmm. Oh. Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[ Chuckles ]
You'll soon realize
you can't do better than me.
I'd love to see the looks at home.
You'd certainly surprise
those English girls, you know.
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, sir.
Oh, damn.
[ Clicks Tongue ]
Hey. Hey, wait.
Wait! Damn it!
Wait, damn you! Stop!
[ Men Chattering ]
How have you been?
I'm well.
As I was two weeks ago.
Pleased to hear that.
You promised to come to Caddagat
as soon as you got back.
I've been busy.
You promised.
We haven't got that muslin Mrs. Bossier wanted.
It'll be here next week.
Thanks, Mrs. Butler.
I'll tell her.
You're just the same
as all men.
And you're different
from other girls?
I've heard how you've been behaving,
flirting with every man within miles.
Who told you that?
Who?
Frank Hawden?
There. That's everything, Miss Melvyn.
And you believed him.
See you next time.
Thank you, Mrs. Butler.
I'm sorry.
So you should be.
I- I thought we were mates.
Aren't we?
I'll see you at the ball.
Ahh!
[ Horse Gallops Away ]
[ Chuckling ]
And do you mean to say
that Frank had to walk four miles back here?
[ Chuckling ]
In his tight boots?
It's no joking matter, Julius.
No, no, Mother. No, no, no.
[ Chuckling ]
Serves him right though.
That girl must learn
to behave.
I've sent her to her room.

Did, uh-
Did you see Harry at Dogtrap?
Yes.
Oh.
You know, I-
I think you might be in love
with Harry Beecham.
[ Laughs ]
We're friends, that's all.
Nothing else.
Be careful how you treat him.
What do you mean?
Well, you know what they say:
Heed the spark or you may dread the fire.
- For heaven's sake.
- Well, Sybylla, he is a man ofthe world.
He has quite a reputation
with the ladies in Melbourne.
Yes, I'll bet he has.
And it's always
been taken for granted...
that he'd marry
into one ofthe best families.
Well, Aunt Gussie
will make sure of that.
Look, Aunt Helen,
you don't have to worry.
I know he can marry anyone.
I know.
And I know he wouldn't
want to marry me.
Even if I wanted to get married,
which I don't,
he'd never ask me in a million years.
So- So long as you know.
In the box,
there's a surprise for you-
a lovely new dress for the ball.

Excuse me, ma'am.
Dinner is served.
Would you come in
to dinner, everyone?
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
Ah, Gussie. Allow me, huh?
Thank you.
[ No Audible Dialogue ]
What a charming evening
it's turned out to be.

At that time it was in a terrible state.
Really shocking. Anyway, I remember-

There were people.
They were soldiers.
They actually- Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.
All right.

I see that Furlow has
bought himself a very fine bull.

Go in, girls, and dance
with the grown-ups.
[ Laughs ]
That was delightful.
Thank you.

I'm afraid she's
a bit of a handful.
I do hope she behaved herself
while she was with you.
Why not? Charming girl.

They've forgotten

Harry, let me go.
Didn't you like me
dancing with the peasants?
I'm not going to make
a big thing ofthis.
I disgraced you, didn't I?
I have to go away for a few days.
Oh, more shearing somewhere else?
And I must be told-
is it yes or no?
- What's the question?
- Bloody woman.
I thought-
I thought
we should get married.
Well, what a handsome proposal.
How could anyone say no?
How dare you.
[ Grunts ]
[ Snatches Riding Crop ]
Harry, I- I'm sorry.
It was my fault.
It was stupid of me.
I should really get back to my guests.
[ Crying ]
Oh!
[ Crying ]
The boy's an idiot,
but you did lead him on.
I didn't mean to.
I'm a misfit, a larrikin.
[ Sniffles ]
My nose is the wrong shape.
True.
Then why me?
Because he loves you,
and I think you love him.
And you make all the other misses
who've been through here...
look like so many pale insipid nobodies,
which they undoubtedly are.
But why does it always have
to come down to marriage?
Don't be foolish, child.
It's natural to want someone
as part ofyou, part ofyour life.
I don't want
to be part of anyone.
Do you imagine you're the only female on Earth
to have such notions?
Loneliness is a terrible price
to pay for independence.
Sybylla, don't throw away reality
for some impossible dream.
It's not impossible.
It's not.

Hello, Podgy.
Hello, silly Syb.
[ Exhales ]
I've got to leave all this, Syb.
We're closing the house.
I'm going north
to see to the other properties.
Why? What's happened?
[ Chuckles ]
The bank wants its money,
and I haven't got it.
They couldn't take everything.
They could.
How long have you known?
Quite a while.
Why didn't you tell me?
I'm sorry. I should've.
I was afraid of losing you as well.
Oh, Harry.
[ Sniffles ]
I am sorry.
Now you know.
There's no need to feel tied.
I mean, I shouldn't have asked you.
I- I had no right.
I'll be a poor man.
But we'll be friends...
and mates.
Won't we?
Of course.
Do you think I cared for you
just because you were rich?
[ Laughs ]
No, Harry.
There's something I must say.
Um,
I- I wish I could help you.
Could you-
Can you give me a bit oftime?
Maybe two years.
You see, I'm just not ready yet.
Last night-
I don't know.
I think I was trying to hurt you,
make you let go, do something.
Give me a chance to find out
what's wrong with the world and with me,
who I am, everything.
Then I'll marry you,
ifyou need me and I can help.
You do understand, don't you?
Of course I do.
[ Sighs ]
I knew you would.
I don't know what you've been up to now,
but Mrs. Bossier wants to see you.
Oh, Biddy, I've just got to finish this page-
She wants you now.
They're all waiting-
Mr. Julius and Mrs. Bell. Hurry.
[ Groans ]
Damn, damn, damn.
[ Grunts ]
Come in, dear,
and sit down.
I'll come straight
to the point, Sybylla.
It seems your father has got himself
into difficulties again. Money, of course.
He borrowed L500
from a chap called McSwat...
and put the farm up as security
at four percent interest.
That's L20 a year. Very fair.
- What's this got to do with me?
- Well, your mother says she's tried,
but there is no way they can pay it.
And this McSwat chap's
made a very generous offer.
He'd be worth a few bob, I'd say.
Julius.
So it's been arranged
that instead of the interest,
he will accept your services
as governess to his children.
Arranged? Don't I have a say?
[ Sighs ]
I won't go.
I won't.
Huh.
Life around here will certainly
be uneventful when she's gone.
Do her the world of good.
Make her think of other people...
instead of herself.

Now, sit up straight and attend.

- James, fetch the textbooks, please.
Ain't got none.
Rats got 'em.
Pa says you can teach
out ofyour head.
Miss Killen couldn't.
She was as mad as a tree full of galahs.
And the one before her
only stayed a week...
and ran off in the bush,
and we never saw her again.
And the one before her.
Possum!
Possum!
Get down!

- Possum!

Give me a bowl.
Here you go.
I don't want any.

[ Pig Snorting ]

[ Grunts ]
Jimmy, I've told you before.
Would you use a fork
to put the food into your mouth.
- Didn't give me one.
- Well, use your fingers.
Don't use your knife.
Why not? Pa does.
- I'm a richer man today than them that don't.
- You're right there, Pa.
[ Lizer ]
Yeah, you're right, Pa.

- Well, your pa doesn't talk with his mouth full.
- Ma does.

You're gonna have your work
cut out with this lot.

Oh. I see you've received
another one ofthese too.
Really, how can she expect us
to believe all this nonsense?
[ Gertie ]
I won! I won!

Of course you won.
I didn't stand a chance.
Oh, yes, you did.
I did not.
You did.
I did not.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah.
Ah, Gertie, Frank.
Just in time for tea.
Did you have a good game?
Yes.
Hmm. And who won?
I did.
Oh.
[ Laughs ]
I think Frank
is being rather gallant.
Ooh. Sandwiches.
[ Chuckles ]
[ Sybylla ]
Today I want to show you
another very important letter-
the letter "H."
"H" follows the letter
we learned yesterday- "G."
"A "-
[ Helen ] Sybylla, we cannot interfere
with your mother's wishes.
The time will soon pass.
You would hardly recognize
your little sister.
She has blossomed
into quite a young lady.

where you are, dear.
We can't always get

I suppose I should thank God
for one agreeable daughter.
If Gertie marries Harry Beecham,
it will be a blessing.
Your grandmother says he's come back
and has managed to regain possession
of Five Bob Downs.
He seems to spend
most of his time with Gertie,
who must enjoy his company.
[ Rooster Crowing ]

Who's that?
It's me.
You gave me a start.
What are you doing out here?

Been over to see Susie again?
Yeah.
Third time this week.
[ Peter Speaking, Indistinct ]
We wanna have
a serious talk with you, lovey.
Now-
Well, you see, we want you to know
that we like you...
and that you're being
a good girl.
It'd be different
ifyou had some property.
You see, our Peter,
he's almost as sure as made it
with Susie Duffy.
What are you talking about?
Oh, we've seen you...
going out at night.
We can't say
we blame you.
He's a good-lookin' lad.
But you don't have any property, you see,
like I said.
You don't think that-
You can't.
Oh, no.
There, there, lovey.
I told you it'd be too much
of a shock for her.
Come on.
No one ever really died of a broken heart.
You see, girl,
things being as they are,
we gotta send you home.
I've wrote a bit
of a letter for you.
Just to tell your ma.
And they don't have
to worry about the money,
not until things look up.
Come on.
Don't take it so hard.
There's plenty of other
nice fellas in the world.
Oh!

Could you see to Maisie
when you've finished separating the milk?

Come on. Oh! Oh, dear.

Let's see how that cake's doing.
Will you bring that in, Aurora?
There now.
[ Child Crying ]
Hey, you poor, wee thing.
You poor, wee thing.
We'll get you out. Come on.
Oh, lift up those legs.
[ Grunting ]
Now, come on. Out you go.
Come on. Come on.
Come on.
Come on. [ Groans ]
That's the way.
Do you need a hand?
[ Chuckles ]
Peeping and prying again, are you?
That's the boy.
Back to your mother. Come on.
It's good to
see you again, Syb.
We heard from Grandmother
that you might be coming down.
[ Chuckles ]
I must look a sight.
I'm glad
you saved Five Bob.
Oh, I was lucky, that's all.
Did- Did you find the answers
to all those questions?
I mean, what was wrong with the world-
Oh, yes.
Partly me.
Oh.
Well,
here I am.
Yes. I don't suppose you
thought it would be like this.
Aunt Gussie sends her love.
She's very keen
on me getting married.
Yes, I think
it's a good idea too.
Oh, Syb, do you?
Yes. Gertie's
just right for you.
She's everything I'm not.
Look, I've got to change.
Father's down in the paddock.
Syb! It's not Gertie I-
It's you.
It's you I want to marry.
Please, please understand.
You promised if I needed you-
I do, Syb.
I love you.
I want to marry you.
Trust me, Syb.
It's me I don't trust.
Can't you see?
[ Sighs ]
The last thing I want is-
is to be a wife out in the bush,
having a baby every year.
You can have
anything you want.
We can go to the city
as much as you like.
Dear, dear Harry.
Maybe I'm ambitious, selfish.
But I can't lose myself
in somebody else's life...
when I haven't lived my own yet.
I want to be a writer.
At least I'm going to try.
But I've got to do it now.
And I've got to do it alone.
Please try and understand.
I thought you loved me.
[ Sighs ]
Harry.
Don't you love me even a little?
Oh, Harry.
I'm so near loving you.
But I'd destroy you.
And I can't do that.
"So now
I've written it all down.
"Why? To try
and make sense of it?
"It may come out sounding
like a couple of nails...
"in a rusty tin pot.
"My ineffectual life may be trod
in the same round oftoil.
"But I want to tell everyone
about my own people,
"how I love them and pity them,
"pity all of us.
"The sun is shining
on another day,
"and hope is whispering in my ear.
"With love and good wishes to all,
"good night.
"Good-bye.
Amen."
