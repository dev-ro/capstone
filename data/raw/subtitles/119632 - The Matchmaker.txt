Better not be a personal call.
How can it be a personal call?

I got a great idea.
Trust me on this. You trust me, right?
No.
I don't know where to go. What...?
Yeah, I trust you, I'm kidding. What is it?
Forget the family values thing.

I have a great idea and the light person

Marcy. Come on.
Hows the hangover?
Hi, Marce. You ever wanted to go to Ireland?
- No.
- Wrong answer.
I think the word we're looking for is yes.
- Yes. Why?
- We are going to follow my destiny.
I don't know what that means.
Nick?
It means that you are gonna follow

Ladies and gentlemen, I am a matchmaker.
Not the matches which are the wooden kind
with the inﬂammable heads, no.
A maker of matches...
that are the human kind of matches.
You know, where two people hit it off
together, go away and get married.
I can see where people make the mistake
of going away and getting married...
Oh, bollocks! Start again.
"Cheaper down the road.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Do you mind doing the bar stock
till Declan comes? Thanks.
Joe, upstairs with that ball, you know that.
You've done it? Great.
OK, three and four, first ﬂoor, upstairs.

Thanks.
Hello. Sony about the “wait,
I have my hands full during the festival.
I know this is short notice
but do you have any rooms available?
- Anything at all?
- No.
Nothing. The brains have been racked,
you can think of nothing.
- Totally full.
- The other hotels. Any vacancies?
I know the Shoreham is full. Bettina?
Yeah?
- Has the Maitland any rooms?
- No, I don't think so.
- See, it's mad busy with the festival.
- I understand but I'm in a bind.
If you don't mind something a little bijou,
I might have one.
I love bijou. Bijou is excellent for me.
Bijou.
(Spring snaps)
- Sorry.
- I hate these awkward silences.
I didn't know there was anybody in here.
I thought this was my bathroom.
- This is my bathroom.
- Yeah, sure. Yeah, it is.
I mean, you're “welcome to join me,
if you like.

- You know how long you're gonna be?
- We're not all Paddys.
It was insensitive of me.
What is your name?
Sean .
Well, Sean, I've had a really, really bad day,
so if you could give me a ball park
how long you're gonna be, I'd appreciate it.
I'd say I'd be five minutes, I'd say.
And then the dog.
- And then yourself.

Yeah, the Irish. You know - the Irish.
Ah, yes, they speak of you all the time.
What the fuck are you telling me? You
telling me it's already in the fuckin' papers?
- Hows things going?
- Fuck you!
Everyone's 100% behind me.
I need a day or two to sort things out.
Well, to be honest Marcy,
this little trip you're taking,
- it's more important that we thought.
- Gotta go.
I've gotta go. It may turn out to be crucial.

It is, isn't it? Listen, I'm not a prude, I swear,

There's a really loud banging noise

- I've got the very girl for you.
- Oh, good man.
- Morning.
- Morning.
Joe, off the phone and tidy your room.
Bettina, start downstairs. I have to go to
the hospital to get my husband.
- What happened?
- Fell off the bus, broke his leg.
- Hows your room?
- Certainly bijou.
Isn't it? Declan, I was just going to meet you.
- I couldn't stay in that hospital.
- Watch it.
- Sean, will you help him?
- All right.
Oh, thanks, Sean. Sean!
Declan, all light.
There's guests, come upstairs.
Sort it out later.
Fill that out and
we'll see what we can do for you.
All these fecking questions!
I'm just looking for a ride, damn it.
I'm not trying to join
a UN fecking peace-heaping force.
Ride? Marriage is a lifelong commitment.
Tony, there. You'd never think it
but he used to be quite the ladies' man.
The mammy  just died.
Left him a lovely little farm near Limerick.
The good news is he's single.
What do you think?
You want to take him for a test drive?
- No.
- No. Maybe not Tony.
I've got lots of clients, a lot of them your age.
You will slay them!
I'll even charge you the widow rate,
I'm that confident.
I don't mean to be rude but who are you?
'What is your favourite colour?'
Dermot, what kind of shite is this?
Dermot O'Brien, I'm the local matchmaker.
- I see.
- There is a small fee involved.
I don't have a favourite colour.
Jesus! Who has a favourite colour?
- Tony, calm down.
- I'll tell you my favourite colour.
- Bollix, that's me favourite colour.
- Excuse me.
Tony, a lot of people have favourite colours.
- What's your favourite colour?
- I don't have a feckin' favourite colour.
- I see you've met Dermot.
- Yes, I did.
Dermot throws in a half-price Turbo suntan.
Of course, he owns the Turbo suntan.
You're not looking to meet Mr Right.
ls there anything I can help with?
Yes, there is. I'm trying to trace
the genealogy of a friend,
find relatives -
do you know where I could do that?
You could try the souvenir shop.
- Good morning.
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm not sure if...
- You're from America.
- Yes, I am. I'm trying to trace...
- What part?
- Boston.
- I knew it!
Yeah. I'm trying to trace the family
of a man named John McGlory.
Follow me.
You've come to the right place, all right.
This way. Sea?
Right. Well, how many do you want?
Oh, gosh, all of them.
The family moved to Boston
some years back.
- The McGlorys.
- Right.
And I cannot emphasise this enough.
I need this information quickly.
Okey-dokey.
I think we've established a rapport
and I do value your company
so I hope you won't be offended
if I bring up that awful subject,
- the fee.
- Of course.
A vulgar, vulgar business.
- Ni doing business with you.
- Bye-bye-
A lot of things go into making
the perfect relationship.
But all these things me under
the one banner
of spiritual compatibility.
A beautiful thing,
that follows no set rules or criteria.
But you can rest assured of one thing.
Your chances are greater
if you have a gorgeous Turbo suntan.
Before...
and after.
Morning.
Tony, you look fabulous.
No, seriously.
Michael, normally I'd slap you silly
for putting Tony under the lamp
for a record-breaking 45 minutes
but the results speak for themselves.
Excuse me.
Hi.
- Yes, how can I help?
- I need a favour.
Get him into the shower
before he peels all over the ﬂoor.
I think I know what you're here for.
No offence,
but I do not want to get married.
Why not?
It's the most natural thing in the world.
You're not married. I don't see a ring.
Well, no, it's not a natural thing for me.
I'm too busy sorting it out for everybody else.
- Anyway, that's not...
- If I was a nice woman like yourself,
I'd be dying to get married,
I'd be up the “walls, I'd be mad for it.
It's not natural for me either, believe me.
What about this place?
- Bad place. Bad woman lives there.
- It looks perfect.
False fecking advertising.
(Woman) Out Out
- Private properly.
- Will you catch yourself come on, Millie?
It's my bar. I reserve the light
to refuse admission to old farts.
- And you have the light to a kick in the arse.
- Eloquently put.
How about this, then? Fuck off!
If you want a real matchmaker, love,
call me.
- Stick it up your arse.
- Stick it up your own arse.
Stick it up your arse.
Usually, the banter's a bit wittier.
- It must be the hormones.
- Don't be shy, love.
I matchmade her.
- She'll be married tomorrow.
- Can I make an announcement?
Everyone pay attention. Our American guest
would like to make an announcement.
Thank you. Hello. Firstly, let me just say
it's wonderful to be here in Ireland.
I'm from America...
Thank you, thank you.
I am representing an American senator
who is searching for his Irish ancestors
who resided here in Baile Na Gra
approximately three generations ago.
So, looking up the Senator's roots.
There must be an election coming up.
- He just wants to find his ancestors.
- His ancestors?
Like all those other American politicians
trying to secure the Irish vote?
Cynical. Can't a senator find his family
without it being politically motivated?
No. Maybe his ancestors were leprechauns.
That'd be good, wouldn't it? How you doing?
- That'd get the leprechaun vote.
- They can't vote.
Too small. Can't reach the ballot box.
Maybe he could be there, give them a hand,
lift them up.
Seeing he has so much Irish blood, now.
Did you want something?
No?
Bye.
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.
We've got this lovely little lady here
from America
who'd like to have a few words.
Give her a big hand because she needs
a lot of encouragement.
Here she is, now. Isn't she lovely?
And I'm sure we all wish her the best of luck
in finding a husband. Hooray!

Thank you for coming.
But if anyone is here just to propose to me,
you should leave now
because this has nothing to do with
the matchmaking festival.
Erm, did you say that anyone who wants

No, I said everyone who wants to propose

Thank you.

You won't believe this but I have landed
in the middle of a matchmaking festival.
Oh, Marce.
'This is gonna be tougher than we thought.'
Rocca's really kicking my ass

You've got to think positive.
Think Jack Kennedy.

Well...don't let me down here, Marcy.

I could really use a gun.

Of course he had to come back.
He was doing well.
His stuff was in the papers.

Together, they have

- Do you still think it's a joke, all this?
- Of course not.
You've got to understand,
it's hard to me on like David Niven
when your nearest neighbour lives five miles
away and is probably another man.
All I do is to get people together in a nice,
friendly atmosphere where they can talk
and see if they feel OK with each other.
You get two lonely people together
sometimes
and it's like they've known each other
all their lives.
- Nice face.
- Thank you.
Funny, isn't it?
Your senator must be desperate,
to get you on a job like this.
He just wants to find his family.
Has he looked in his house?
They might be there.
What is your problem?
Why does it bother you?
Don't dress it up. It's show business.
That is such a lazy cliché.

Honest to God, I don't know.
He's got more sense getting married...
Hi. Dermot says you wanted me to give you
a lift to the Alan Islands.
I am all right with that,
I just wondered why me in particular?
- I don't want you in particular.
- (Ship's horn blares)
- Where is that ferry going?
- The Aran Islands.
Of course it is.
- Want a hand with that?
- No, I got it.
- Here, let me give you a hand.
- I can do it.
- I'll get it for you.
- I n get it.
- All right?
- Yes.
I hope this guys as knowledgeable
as Dermot says.
I'd say he is.
These old fellas know everything.
- Mr O'Hara!
- More feckin' tourists.
We'd like to talk to you.

Oh, my God! He's crazy.
He just threw a rock at me.
Threw a rock at you?
He threw a rock at both of us.

That's the come in gesture. That's good.

it's the one bit of Irish every school kid
has to know

you don't get out of the class
- and you go in your pants...
- OK, I got it.
- ..And you're in trouble. It's not very nice.
- I got it.
'Tis in there.
- Actually, I'll hold on to it.
- I thought you might.
- What do you want?
- Dermot O'Brien said you could help me.
Oh, he did, did he?
And leave that alone!
This isn't a feckin' museum, you know.
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for the McGlorys
who moved to Boston a long time ago.
'A long time ago.' That's a great help.
That really narrows it down.
Tell me, is Dermot O'Brien still conning
tourists into marrying complete strangers?
You never used his services?
Feck off!
Me and Eileen, childhood sweethearts.
Oh, God, I miss her sometimes.
That's her there.
Pretty. I'm sorry. When did she pass away?
What? Oh, Jesus, she's not dead.
She's away on her holidays!
Oh, God, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
God, that's priceless. I must remember that.
Will you have some coffee?
You will, you will, you will, you will.
The McGlorysl
Now, there's no McGlorys in this area, no.
But one group went to Australia
and another group ended up in Liverpool.
But no McGlorys ever went
from here to Boston.
I'm surprised that Dermot didn't pass
this information on to you himself.
Sure, Jesus, didn't I tell him all this
on the phone last night?
Cappuccino?
The matchmaker's ethics.
(Marcy) What am I doing here?
Why have I me?
You're trying to find an Irish family so
a politician can drink Guinness with them.
- World-shattering stuff.
- It's a bit more relevant than that.
Tending bar in a tasteless shirt is
a more valid way to spend your time?
(Chuckling) I do think that
tending bar in a tasteless shirt
is a more valid use of my time, yes, I do.
That's why I do it.
I like the world just the way it is. Thank you.
No way. You couldn't be content
with the way of the world, you couldn't.
If you were, I'd be forced to hate you.
Aha!
So you don't hate me?
The basis for any friendship is that
the two people don't hate each other. Yeah?
You know, it's going to be dark soon.
We'd better stay here on the island.
Wait a minute. This isn't some plan

I was just a PR man for anybody
kind enough to send me a press release.
Sounds kind of cushy.
Why would you give that up?
Things rarely go according to one's youthful,
heroic master plans, do they?
Sometimes it's net only easier to walk away
from something,
it's also the right thing to do, you know?
Sometimes the easy way out's
the right way out.
You could say that.
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.
- You startled me.
- I know, I'm sorry.
- I'm dating an American. In America.
- I'm seeing somebody.
- And we wouldn't want Dermot to succeed.
- No, absolutely not.
I'm sorry. No problem.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.
l just wanted to... You know.
I am so thrilled
not to be stuck in that office right now.
This is great.
Shit. You all right?
You OK?
Hi.
Can we please have the two largest
whiskeys you've ever poured?
- Also, where is your phone?
- Over there.
Thank you. Down.
Ow Ow
- You OK?
- I'm fine.
- Sure now?
- Yes.
(Speaks Irish)
- No, thanks.
- She looked a heavy carry.
No. Sure, no. Not at all, no.
Hi. I need to make a collect ll, please,
to the Slates. Massachusetts.
How you doing?
- Marcy on line five, Senator.
- I'll take it in my office.
- Hello, Marcy, where are you?
- 'The Aran Islands.'
- Where?
- 'Aran Islands.'
- Where is that?
- Off the coast.
Listen, I'm stuck here tonight
but tomorrow I can investigate some more.
But warn you it does not look likely that any McGlorys
came from Baile Na Gra to Boston. Sorry.
Listen, Marce, you don't understand -
they did. The old man told me.
I mean where do I me from?
I must have me from somewhere.
I wasn't made in a laboratory.
I'm a United States Senator.
I understand that.
I'm trying and I will continue to try.
Yeah, I know. I know you've done your best.
Absolutely no McGlorys.
Complete McGlory-free zone.
- So plan two.
- Plan B?
- Plan B, two, whatever.
- Plan B2? What's that?
Here's what you're gonna do.
Couldn't help overhauling your americian accent.
Are you just visiting?
- Yeah, I am.
- Could you do us a favour?
We can't decide who's the best singer here.
Could you judge? It's a sort of tradition
that a single girl decides.
We don't often get girls
as attractive as yourself here.
Go on, why wouldn't you?
Sure, tis a great judge that you'd be -
and you from the land of Perry Mason.
This isn't a humiliate the tourist scenario?
- No.
- OK, then you do it.
It has to be a single girl.
- OK, what do I do?
- Good girl yourself.

Yeah, I'm his wife.
Listen, sorry if I've me at a bad time.
- You haven't...
- We're separated, Marcy.
- Great, great. That's good.
- Sorry, I'm going, I...
This happened last time.
I keep popping up at bad moments.
No, I really... I have so much to do.
We wouldn't want a repeat of last time.
- Stay.
- Nice meeting you.
Marcy, me back.
Marcy. Marcy.
- What are you doing here?
- I thought I might give up my job
and work as a bar tender.
Stay out of my business.
It has nothing to do with you.
Hey!

I think your mother will love this.
There you go.
And I'll throw in one of them as a little gift.
There you go,
it's a pleasure doing business with you.
I'll see you to the door.
Miss? Hey!
How could you find anything

What kind of system is this?
What kind of ineffective
yet not inexpensive system is this?
It's my own personal system.
Please, don't mess it up.
Why? Who would know?
Big difference.
What are you hiding?
Hiding? I don't know
what you're talking about.
Would you move?
Excuse me. Please.
I don't believe ill
Everything is in here, isn't it?
Everything I need is right in here.
Well, yeah.
No , not the face

Well, fuck me, not another one.
I'm sorry, that's a guest phone.
There's a public one...
- Yes, we need two rooms.
- We're totally booked.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- What's going on?
- Here's my girl.
Real shithole of a hotel you picked here.
I gotta talk to you.
- In private.
- Typical. No signal.
All right, enough! I'll do it.
We know you'll do it. You gel paid to do it.
- Why haven't you done it already?
- I don't want to.
- I don't feel it's within my brief.
- Well, let's have a brief rebriefing.
My brief is to get him re-elected.
Yours is to do what I tell you to.
So find some fake McGlorys,
whoever they might be,
Clanaghans, Shanaghans,
whoever they are,
get them to have a pint with him
so we can film it, go home
and make sure that he's re-elected, OK?
So you'll set it up and we'll...
What, talk to you?
I'll have the whole family ready tomorrow.
- That's my girl.
- The whole family?
All of them.
You did it. Great!
I didn't find anyone.
Just, I heard...
We're gonna pay some people
to pretend that they're McGlorys.
Dear God,  What?
Don't look at me like that. Wait a second!
Wait! Wait!
I do not except that expression
from a philandering married hypocrite.
- I don't lie for a living.
- What? Come on!
It is so easy to pretend you're virtuous
when you're stuck here on Brigadoon!
What? What was that? What was that?
- Brigadoon? Was that it?
- Yes.
Listen, this place
is as real as anywhere else
and if you haven't realised that yet
then fuck you!
And your boyfriend.
What are you looking at?
Get in the car.
Dermot. Hi.
- Marcy. About Sean...
- Please, I don't wanna talk about Sean.
I need another favour.
I was not able to locate the people...
the family that I needed to find.
And, erm, this is gonna sound
slightly immoral
but I...er...
What? What's so funny?
Get up. Get off. Go. Down.
What are you laughing at?
You know what that Marcy's up to?
She asked me to help her.
Did she?
Sometimes the easy way out
is the right way out.
(Donner) Watch it.
You're like a bad penny,
you keep coming back.
Thanks a million.
Look, I'm sorry, I just didn't want you
on my conscience any more.
What? What's that supposed to mean?
I know you left Dublin of me cos of me.
That's bollocks. Don't ﬂatter yourself, Moira.
Dublin was great for you.
You're a good writer.
I don't want to see you
just giving it all up cos I left you.
First of all, I haven't given anything up yet,
and I'm here because I like it here.
Second, you can't run back to me everytime
one of your boyfriends hits the dust.
- Here's another for you.
- I always do me back though.
Jesus Christ,
do I have to do everything for you?
Go on.
Girls, hows the craic?
- (Laughter)
- Great, nice chatting to you.
Me friend would like a dance with you.
And let me tell you,
the man is hung like a stallion.
How do you know?
Oh, I know. I just know.
Tell him I'm very ﬂattered but no, thank you.
Let me make
an honest woman of you, Moira.
Divorce me. I don't want to play any more,
I'm too old.
You're right. I know you're right.
Say yes.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
- Yes? Yes?
- Yes.
You won't regret it, I swear.
Who's your man in a suit?
- The big fella?
- Yeah.
That's Senator John McGlory.
Would you like to meet him?
No, Sean, he doesn't want to be bothered
with me.
- Come on, let's meet him.
- No, I was just wondering.
- Come on.
- Sean, stop it.
You were never backward
about being forward, Moira. Come on.
A horse? Isn't that great?
That's my favourite animal too
- It says here zebra.
- Well, a zebra...
- Hello.
- Hi, hows it going?
- Sean Kelly.
- John McGlory.
This is Moira. Having a good time, Senator?
I am. Beautiful town.
I particularly like the...
- Marcy speaks very highly of you.
- Well...
So highly, in fact, I'm finding it hard
to reconcile her John McGlory
with the one that I know.
- Have we met?
- No.
But I'm aware of your political career.
You're a hard man to pin down.
We're in the middle of something...
You're a politician who's  never stood firm
on any issue in your career.
Well, I think if you'll...
Health care. Funding disclosures.
Welfare state expenditure restrictions.
You've turned around so many times
nobody knows where you stand.
Sean, I'm a big supporter of dissent.
Without dissent we cannot have a...
I hope for Marcy's sake
you're half the man she thinks you are.
- OK. Thanks for dropping by.
- Thank you.
I hope you find those Irish roots.
All right. Thank you.
Have a seat, please.
Moira, is it? Join us.
There's always one, isn't there?

Hello! Hello there!
- Dermot O'Brien.
- John McGlory.
- I'm the liaison office for this area.
- They expecting me?
They've been jumping up and down
with excitement.
I had to hit one with a big stick
to heap him quiet. Come on.
(Dermot) Now me on in. Come in.
Come on, and let me introduce you
to these lovely people.
There's Paddy, Padderoge,
Brigid, Michael and Eileen.
Brigid won't talk today
because her teeth are away being repaired.
And if Michael suddenly passes out,
please don't film him.
It's the old narcolepsy.
Now, everybody, I want to introduce you
to Senator John McGlory.
He's related to you.
(Donkey braying)
- Is that daddy?
- Shut up.
As Mr O'Brien said, I'm a McGlory.
I'm a McGlory as well!
Jesus, the world must be full of McGlorys
But we're cursed. We're cursed!
We're cursed!
Oh, Jesus, what've you got there?
Will you look at this? The shit bucket's full.
Don't talk about the shit bucket
in front of strangers.
Come here to me.
That's not full! There's room in there
for at least two more goes.
Oh, Jesus, so that's where they are!
Me teeth! Oh, bollocks!
And speaking of Boston,
that's where the Senator's from.
That's a fuckin' mad place.
I wouldn't go there.
All the men'd be trying to ride me.
Senator, would you like a cup of tea?
- Go on, have a cup of tea.
- Er, no, thank you.
No, sit down, I'm fine.
I'll make you a cup of tea.
Don't you speak out of turn,
you brazen hussy!
And you coming in at all hours of the night
with the young fellas going up to your room
to do God knows what!
I hate you!
That's it. I'll take the belt to you,
you little whore!
I've no belt.
Jesus, give us your belt! I want your belt!
I want your fuckin' belt!
- Give me the belt. I want your belt.
- Please, now, please...
I look like a fucking fool.
Mister, would you like to take this with you?
What the hell was that all about, Marcy?
You are fired!
How dare you sabotage me
and the Senator and the campaign.
- I didn't set that up!
- The fact is...
you have had your thumb up your ass,
doing Christ knows what -
not doing your job, and putting
my re-election second to your holiday!
- How can you say that?
- That's the way it looks.
Shut up! How can you say
I put the election second?
I spend 99% of my time
securing your re-election!
You know what I do with
the other 1% of my time? I sleep!
As I said, I didn't know
it was gonna go down like that!
But I'm glad they did it
because using people like that is arrogant.
It goes against everything
I hoped we stood for.
God, I'm not wrong about this
and I fucking quit.
Marcy. Marcy!
- Nice speech.
- Thank you.
Give me a fucking break.
You're not buying into this bullshit?
- Forget it.
- Hold it.
- Maybe you ought to go into politics.
- Yeah, right.
I'm sorry.
That's not me, that's... You know.
I promise, no more stunts like that.
I hope you'll stay with us. We need you.
I need you.
I'm sorry.
Against my better judgment
I'll stay until the election.
Good.
Think there's any resemblance?
Yeah, a little too much for my liking.
Come over and have a look.
I think what I've done is brilliant.
Brilliant.
Now, that's all you're getting today.
No more.
Greedy guts, the lot of you.
Keep it together, man. Not much further.
Hey, Dermot.
No, I told Marcy no more stunts.
Look, this woman,
what if she doesn't want to?
- OK, all I'm saying is...
- Here's your coffee.
You don't have to. Just go through with
the matchmaking procedure.
- I don't know.
- This will be incredible TV.
Part of a timeless Irish tradition and...
- You don't think it's a little sick?
- Seen the latest polls?
Hey.
I think I can arrange a reception,
have the townspeople greet you...
We ought to think bigger than that.

- Parade. Festival.
- This is a festival.
No, like our own McGlory festival with,
I don't know...leprechauns.
- Gel a couple of midgets in green suits...
- Marcy.
- What's the matter?
- That was Sean.
Dermot's died.
O, my God.
I'm sorry.
Dermot, that was the guy
this morning, light?
Yeah.
You know...
you should go to that funeral
and, you know, pay your respects.
Cos, er...
that'd look great on tape.
I always thought
you were just really good at your job.
But you really are an asshole, aren't you?
They go hand in hand, Senator.
...On behalf of the soul
of your servant, Dermot,
whom Thou hast this day
called out of the world
that thou wouldst not deliver him
into the hands of the enemy...
I was one of his few failures.
I let him down.
No. The festival's not over yet.

No.
You do, pet.
Where are they? Sorry.

- Yeah, I'm fine.

I'm really, really sorry about everything-
It's OK. It's all right. Sure.

Ma’am, we have to catch a plane,
so...we're in a bit of a hurry.
Er...
So I'll see you around?
Well, I won't see you around but...
Marcy.
Dermot wanted you to have something.
- OK.
- It's at his house or something...
- I'll meet you there in an hour.
- Yeah. Great.
All right.
She's ready, Senator.
This is how it's always been done.
And it's a certain way of finding out
if you're suitable for each other.
If you'll just step into the cubicle here
and spend 20 minutes getting to know
each other with no one else around.
I beg your pardon, no, this isn't allowed.
- No, it is allowed.
- There's rules and regulations.
There's a certain protocol
and you have to leave.
Just screw it. Thanks.
Oh, God, I don't... This...
- What?
- I really don't know anything about you.
I know. Well, why don't we start again?
All right.
Hello, I'm Senator John McGlory.
Moira Kelly. Well, Kelly's my married name.
- What's your maiden name?
- Kennedy.
Just... Sorry.
Just give me a tight close-up on her.
Sean, get some food,
we're just runing a bit low.
Thanks.
- What the...?
- You all right?
I might have known.
You did that deliberately.
- No, I didn't.
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- Give it a rest.
- Fuckin' kill you.
What are you doing?
Come on, Sean.
Put me down, Sean!
Put me down.

We're on our way.

You want to see fast, eh?
You want to see fast, eh?!

Sean?
Sean?
Where the hell have you been?
Give me the keys.
Bring the car around, all fight?
- Declan.
- Hey, Marcy.
- Where's Sean?
- Didn't she tell you?
- Where'd everybody go?
- They've moved to Doyle's.
- Thanks.
- He's not with them.
- Where'd he go?
- I don't have him electronically tagged.
I'm coming. I'm coming!
- Tell him I said goodbye.
- Yeah.
Sure.
Most definitely.
He's not the President.
Declan, why didn't Marcy
say goodbye to Sean before leaving?
Haven't a clue, love.
You didn't tell her!
Now, Sarah...
I'm going to miss you, you old bastard.
I'm going to miss you, you old bastard.

No, I won't. Tell him.
Go on.

What?
She's headed off to the airport.
She's gone?
You fuckin' bastard. She was mine!
- Stop it!
- I should kill you!
I want this shite ended now! Right now!
What am I going to do?
Will you drive me to the airport?
You know I can't drive.
Michael, will you drive me to the airport?
What am I going to do? Huh?

Yeah. I think it would.
Ah! My leg

'My success rate has been nearly 100%.
Which is more than I can say
for those dating agencies.
This is an opportunity too good to refuse.
The end.
Well, Marcy, how about it?
Have we a deal?
You bring over a few more single Yanks
and I'll get them hitched.
Come on, Marcy, let's do it.
Let's matchmake America.
I'll be wailing for your call.
(Doorbell)
I'll be right down.
Well, it was a narrow victory
but a victory nonetheless.
(cheering)
I just want to thank everyone on our team
and my future wife,
Mrs Moira Kennedy McGlory.
Thank you.
I am very, very proud to be up here
in front of you this evening.
And to be able to say the world is my family.
Hey-ho, let's go!
(Chanting) Hey-ho, let's go...
- Hi, how are you?
- What kind of Scotch is this?
Punch.
- You must be so proud of your son.
- I'm very proud.
If he'd screwed up I would have shot him.
I almost screwed up. I could not find
any of your relatives in Baile Na Gra.
Baile Na Gra?
You know, Ireland,
where your people are from.
No, you would have had better luck
in Budapest.
- I'm sorry?
- We're not Irish.
Stop it.
We're Hungarian .
The real name is something like Mikkelorge.
McGlory is the Ellis Island name,
you know the kind of thing.
And as a Democrat living in Boston,
I may have played up the Irish thing
just a wee bit.
Wait, are you kidding?
It's a great day for the Irish!
- And for the Hungarians.
- I guess so.
How about a real Scotch?
- I also want to thank the little people...
- (Feedback)
...the nameless faces behind the scenes
who assisted...
Excuse me, I'm in the middle of
a press conference.
The nameless, faceless people
who put in the hours
and don't get enough of the credit.
Marcy, it seems like
a very macho atmosphere,
- how do you deal with that?
- About this macho thing,
there  is no macho atmosphere,
are have many competent female staff
and I think Marcy would back me up.
We are pro-women's rights
right down the line.
(Nick) Marce. Where you going?
I'm going home.
I don't think so.
He's in there, he's gonna start drinking,
I got press people...
You're the team player, you take care of it.
Nice.
That is just fine.
I baby-sat the guy long enough,
one more night's not gonna kill me.
He's like a chimp
that I feed lines instead of bananas.
(Nick, over PA) And he's an asshole.
He hasn't had an idea in...
how many years, I don't know.
When he's sober he's boring, when
he's drunk he's boring and an asshole.
Repeat what you just said.
- What?
- Repeat what you just said.
Don't try to pretend McGlory's anything other
than a complete moron
I'm not buying it.
'Start sucking up to me
because I won the election. OK?'
No, I just wanted to hear it again
because you have a thing on your tie.
Ahem. Hey!
Hello. Little joke that we kind of set up
because of pressure and everything.
I think we all could use...
(PA) 'I said six more years!
Six more years! Six more years!
'That's right, he's gonna be feeling
proud tonight because he's from Boston!
'Let's hear it for him!
'That's what I say. Join me now.
'He's there for all of us
and you know what I say?'
