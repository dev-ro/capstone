Hello!
Mimi!
How are you?
Got it!
What a mysterious melody...
Children who Chase Lost Voices
from Deep Below
I haven't been able to hear it again...
Good evening!
Good evening.
Thanks for watching over me.
I'll bring you dinner later, 'kay?
Mom?
You're home early today!
Oh.
Forgot to turn off the light.
Dad, l'm home.
Where did you get in from?
Quit it, Mimi!
Let's give thanks...
That sure was a mysterious song.
I wonder if l'll be able to hear it again?
Goodnight, Mimi.
A light?
Maybe it was my imagination...
Next, Miss Yuu Yazaki.
Keep up the good work.
I will!
Next, Miss Asuna Watase.
Coming.
Asuna has the best score
in the class once more.
Asuna's first again?
You've really been working hard,
haven't you?
That's our class rep for ya!
She's a studyin' machine!
Now then, before you go, there's
a warning l need to give you.
Lately there have been reports
from a number of students
about a creature near Obuchi
that looks like a bear.
about a creature near Obuchi
that looks like a bear.

Just in case, please go atraight home.
It was near the railroad bridge...
My brother said he saw it.
Please go home with a friend
that lives near you.
Please go home with a friend
that lives near you.
Yes, ma'am!
Hey, Asuna!
Want to walk home together?
Oh... Sorry, l have to hurry back.
Thanks for asking, though.
Sure... Maybe another time?
Five kilos of rice, please.
Thank you, as always.
Oh, are you all right with that?
Just fine, thank you!
What lovely weather...
I can't hear the birds...
W What in the world ...
Stay away!
Stand back.
It'll be okay.
Um...
Its life is coming to an end.
No!
I'm sorry for putting you
in such a scary situation.
This is the end, you see.
U Um, wait a sec...
Trust me.
I'm sure I came here to meet you.
You're awake, l see.
Yeah...
The danger has passed,
so you ca return home safely now.
Um... You saved me, right?
Thank you!
It'd be best for you not to come
near this mountain any longer.
Mimi?
I know what I saw!
There were definitely people there.
Two kids, about this tall...
Kids?
Commander!
Over here.
Miss Watase?
Is Asuna absent?
I do hope she's feeling all right...
Now, I think you all might
have heard already,
but that bear appeared yesterday
on the Obuchi Bridge.
We know! A freight train hit it, right?
I heard the police are investigatin'.
But I heard it's already dead .
If you'll pardon the interruption...
It might still be near the routes you take
to school, so take extra special care.
Yes, ma'am!
Yuu, will you tell Asuna for me?
Sure.
Also, the substitute teacher
that'll be filling in for me
while l'm on maternity leave
will be coming tomorrow.
Is she pretty?
Sorry, but it's a man.
A guy?
No, l'm definitely going.
It was the bridge right ahead, I heard...
How frightful...
I heard they already started the
trains up again, they did...
Well, there's only one every two hours!
Heya, Asuna!
Hello.
Lovely sunny day, yes?
Yes... Well...
Oh, Mr. Sato...
Howdy.
Hey, did you hear? They say that bear
showed up on the Obuchi Bridge!
It's here!
Look at this...
Tree saplings...
From the power of vita aqua?
It's crystallizing...
Perhaps someone has come up
to the surface.
Search the area!
I figured she would come.
Even though I warned her.
Yeah...
Actually, l was hoping she would come, too.
l thought I told you
it would be better not to come.
But...
Mimi!
Why, you traitor...
You were only supposed to
get along with me!
You no good two timer...
This... was my place to begin with.
I don't want anyone telling me
not to come here.
I'm the same way.
I came here because I wanted to.
I'm Shun. lt's nice to meet you.
I'm ... Asuna.
Your arm!
It's bleeding... ls this from yesterday?
Oh, it's fine.
But it's my fault that you ...
You should get it looked at
in the hospital later.
My mom works there.
It looks like you have everything
you could need here.
Yeah. But it's the first time this
has ever come in handy.
l kinda wanted my own place,
so l brought things up piece by piece.
You know?
And this is the best place for
the tuning into the radio.
Radio?
Okay, all finished!
Thank you.
Would you like to listen?
I use this crystal instead of a diode.
Depending on the weather and time of day,
you can get different signals.
Hey, that stone...
Got it!
Here.
It's a music program, see?
Yeah...
Want some?
Thank you, l was hungry.
Before, just once, l tuned in to
a really mysterious melody...
It was a song different from any
music l'd ever known before.
Almost like it was the sound
of someone's heart itself.
When l heard it, I was both sad
and happy at the same time,
and l was able to feel like
l was no longer alone...
It will stay with me, always...
I wish l could hear it once again.
Shun...?
You aren't going to ask me anything, Asuna?
I'm sure you must have many questions.
Like what that bear thing was?
Right.
Yeah... But I'm okay for now.
There's so much to ask...
I bet it'll take a while, so l'll
come back here tomorrow.
I came from a different land
named Agartha.
Agartha...
A foreign country?
Yeah.
There was something l wanted to
see, and someone l had to meet.
But now l've accomplished everything
l wanted. l have no regrets.
So your wish came true?
Yeah...
You should go home before it gets dark.
Right... l'll go home after the
cicadas stop chirping.
Asuna...
I'll give you a blessing.
Close your eyes.
Okay...
W Was that just a... k k k kiss?
Asuna.
All l wish is for you to live.
That's all l want...
U Um, uh...
Sorry, see you tomorrow!
Tomorrow, then.
Whoa, what a shock...
Shun...
So, it was her that heard my final song...
She called you Mimi, right?
Please, lead Asuna to
a better place in my stead.
At this point,
the fear is almost unbearable...
But at the same time, there's just as
powerful happiness.
It's like my hand can almost reach them...
I'm home, Asuna.
Welcome home! You must be
tired from the night shift.
Yeah... Oh, two lunches today?
Yeah, one's for a friend!
Mom, you'll eat breakfast, right?
Yeah.
Maybe we could eat it together?
What are you talking about?
You've eaten already, right?
I can still eat a bit more. Actually,
l'm still kind of hungry.
No. You have to make sure
you're not late to school.
Asuna, why don't we go out to
dinner somewhere tonight?
I have the day off, you see.
Really?
Then l'll be home before six!
Six?
Today's Saturday, right?
Where are you going?
To a friend's place! See you later!
Hey, what happened to your scarf?
I lost it. I'll buy another
at the school store!
Have a nice day!
A friend, huh?
Are you sure about that?
Ah, I see. Yes, yes...
Anyway, l'll ask tomorrow.
And I told him l'd come today...
Maybe it's because of the rain?
I'm home.
Sorry, Mom... can you get me a towel?
My, look at you... you're sopping wet!
You didn't bring an umbrella?
No... H Hey, l can dry myself!
Mom?
What is it?
The body of a boy with your scarf
wrapped around his arm
was found in the Shimonofuchi riverbed.
Asuna... That boy died.
That's got to be someone else...
After all, it's not like he fell or anything.
Asuna...
I'm fine. I'm sure it's a mistake,
don't worry.
Since it's raining,
let's do dinner some other time.
I need to do my homework.
Asuna...
I'm fine, okay?
Shun!
Shun!
Dad's not coming back anymore?
Is he, Mom?
To wish for something like that... l'm
sure he wouldn't want that, yes...
Dad said that death was
a part of life, after all.
Even so...
I...
And in that way, his wife died.
Overcome with grief,
Izanagi decided to travel to the land
of Yomi far underneath the earth,
in order to bring his dead wife,
Izanami, back from the dead.
After traveling deep underneath the earth,
he finally reunited with his wife,
and she said this:
'' I have already become a resident
of the land of the dead. ''
'' However, if the god of Yomi allows it,
l can return home with you. ''
'' But for that to happen,
there is one condition. ''
''While I am talking with the god,
you must not look at my body. ''
But lzanagi broke that promise.
He opened the gate to Yomi.
And therefore Izanagi's wife can
no longer return with him.
That is what is written in the first
verse of the Kojiki Mythology.
Similar myths of people heading below
the earth to resurrect people
are found throughout the world .
The land of Yomi.
Underworld, Hades, Shambhala, Agartha...
They are called different names,
but they are all said to be worlds
underneath the earth.
People once believed that under the
earth held the secret to death itself.
Everyone, it is time to go home from school.
Is there something about Asuna?
Is there something about Asuna?
Is there something about Asuna?

No, she just seems very serious, so l was
wondering what kind of student she was...
No, she just seems very serious, so l was
wondering what kind of student she was...
No, she just seems very serious, so l was
wondering what kind of student she was...

Yes... She's well behaved,
and a very good girl.
Yes... She's well behaved,
and a very good girl.
But her father passed away
when she was young,
and her mother seems to be very
busy with her nursing work.
I do wonder if she's trying too
hard to be good, you know...
Is that so?
And they found that corpse of the
unidentified boy before, yes?
Asuna, aren't you going home?
Yuu... I have something
I'd like to ask Mr. Morisaki.
I don't really like him so much...
Today's lesson was kinda scary...
Scary?
I heard a rumor that his wife died...
Pardon me.
So?
Seems like he went home already.
Later!
See you tomorrow.
You're...
Um, l'm sorry, but l had something
l wanted to ask you.
Wait here just a moment.
Do you drink coffee?
Yes! lf you could put some milk in it...
Thank you.
Um, l'm sorry for barging in like this.
I asked Ms. lkeda where you lived.
As you can see, I live by myself.
Make yourself at home.
Of course, l've just arrived here...
All l really have are books.
So, what is it?
U Um, about class today...
You were listening very intently, yes...
You have someone you want
to bring back from the dead?
So, it was you who met the boy
that came from Agartha...
Look at this.
We call them ''Quetzal Coatl '' .
They are the gatekeepers that guard
the entrances to Agartha.
And what do you think of this one?
It looks similar to the one from before.
It's a 3,000-year-old statue
of a god from Sumeria.
Once there were gods like
this all around the world,
guiding the path of
the yet young humanity.
Those are the Quetzal Coatl.
Eventually humanity grew up, and the existence
of gods was no longer necessary.
The Quetzal Coatl, realizing
their role had now ended,
hid themselves under the earth
as gatekeepers.
Along with a number of different clans.
Clans?
A small number of humans went with the
Quetzal Coatl underneath the ground.
In other words, to the underworld, Agartha.
In Agartha remain the gods that disappeared,
and knowledge yet unknown,
and it is said to be a place where
any kind of wish can be fulfilled.
Even resurrecting the dead!
Is Agartha real?
Who knows? Perhaps it is just a legend.
All l have been doing is researching
all the different theories.
But...
You should head home. lt's getting dark.
Thank you.
I'm not sure l was much help...
No, you were... Um..
Mr. Morisaki, l'm sure that
Agartha really exists.
It'll be night soon. Go straight home,
and don't stray from the path.
Mimi?
Hey, wait... Mimi!
Wait, l said!
Mimi, where are you?
Shun, Shun!
I knew it!
Who are you?
Did he make contact with a Topsider?
Shun...?
He's gone.
Just forget everything that's happened.
Arch Angel? l have to go!
A boy from Agartha? Hand over the clavis.
Who are these people?
Damn it!
Don't hit them.
We'll let them lead us to it.
That jewel...
This clavis?
I came to the surface to get it back.
This way, they can't get in.
Wait until morning and then go home.
The surface?
So Agartha really is underground?
You've even heard about that?
Shun... Could you have lost your memories?
Now see here...
In there.
Damn it! They're coming in!
Hey, how far are we...
Hurry up and follow!
They're coming after us!
Shun, is this cave...
I told you already! l'm not Shun!
I'm under no obligation
to save you , you know.
Then what's the deal?
If you're not Shun, then who are you?
Quiet. You stay here.
What?
The gatekeeper.
The gatekeepers once guided
humans long ago.
But because of the polluted
atmosphere above,
most of them have lost their senses...
It'd be great if they remembered ...
Shun!
Stay there!
Are you okay?
It's not over yet. Take the clavis.
I don't want to kill the gatekeeper.
I have to put the gatekeeper to sleep!
Shun!
Shun!
If there's a Quetzal Coatl, then
this must be the entrance!
Are you okay?
Let's run...
This is a Pakicetus... They were
supposed to be extinct.
What is it?
An ancient whale from
50 million years ago. Kill it.
But we have to recover all the evidence...
As long as we get that clavis, there
won't be any complaints.
Do it.
Stop!
Come here with that clavis!
If you don't, l'll kill the boy.
Don't do it.
I could just kill both of you.
Shun...
I'll save you when l see a chance.
Right.
Come, and don't stop halfway.
Watch over the boy here.
Is that the gate?
Most likely.
Neither explosives nor drills will be
effective, like at the South Pole.
Touch the clavis to that light.
What's the matter? Do it.
The lnterstitial Sea...
Finally, it's within my grasp...
Good work, men.
Commander, what are you...
I'll be going alone from here.
Give the old men back at
Europa my best wishes.
Don't move!
Shun!
What's the meaning of this?
Mr. Morisaki?
Now that l've come this far, I have
no reason to be your enemy.
All l want to do is go to Agartha.
Agartha is falling into ruin.
Nothing Arch Angel hopes to find is there.
I do not seek the secret to eternal life
or the knowledge of the ancients.
All l want is to return
my wife to the living.
Do as you wish, l don't care.
My only mission was to retrieve the clavis.
What's your name?
Asuna.
I'm Shin. Shun's younger brother.
Shin? Then , Shun is...
My brother is dead.
He knew that he couldn't survive
on the surface for long,
yet he broke the rules and went anyway.
I'm leaving now.
You can open the exit even without a clavis.
I'm sorry about you getting involved,
Asuna...
Shin...
I've put you in a scary situation.
Mr. Morisaki, why?
Have you heard of the name Arch Angel?
No...
It's the only organization that recognizes
the existence of Agartha.
It wants the knowledge of the underworld
in order to lead humanity on the proper path.
I am a member, and have been searching
for the entrance to Agartha for ten years.
But, the people you were with...
Arch Angel is actually just a group
of empty headed Gnostics.
I have no interest in such things.
My only goal is resurrecting my wife.
I'm now going to head to Agartha,
and search for a way.
Sorry for putting you in such danger.
I knew it... lt's vita aqua.
Mr. Morisaki!
Mr. Morisaki...
I'm coming too!
Why? Do you want to bring
that dead boy back to life?
Well...
I don't really know...
But!
It may be a dangerous journey, and
I don't know when we'll be able to return.
I understand.
Come.
This is an ancient fluid known as vita aqua.
It is hardly buoyant at all, so if it fills you r
lungs, you should be able to breathe.
Agartha is below.
Um, Mr. Morisaki, wait...
It's okay. You can breathe in the water.
This is to bring back someone precious...
Make your decision, Asuna!
We'll be able to meet her soon...
Yes... l pray that this child's
life will be a blessing...
Don't worry. Just by being born,
life is already full of happiness.
That's right...
I need to be born soon.
Stars...
Mimi...
Are you awake?
That little guy popped out of your bag.
You brought it with you?
No...
When did you...
You might not have the luxury to
take it with you the whole way.
With me?
Mr. Morisaki, is this...
It looks like we can get through those
stairs on the other side. Let's go.
Something is here.
Yes...
This might be a gatekeeper, a Quetzal Coatl.
It's looking at us.
I guess we'll have to take it straight on.
Mimi!
Mimi, come here.
Asuna!
Mimi!
Asuna, let's go.
That might be more useful than I thought.
Agartha.
Mr. Morisaki, look!
Shakuna Vimana! The ark
on which rides God itself!
It's just as the literature said ...
God ...
That's...
A clavis?
A fragment of one?
But why do you have that?
It's a crystal for a radio. l was told
it was a memento of my dad.
A memento?
Clavis is Latin for '' key'' .
It may end up being of help to us later.
Take good care of it.
Right.
Let's head in the same direction as that ark.
Something should be there... Something
we are looking for.
Here.
There are traces of villages,
just as you thought!
Although no matter where we go,
they're in ruins.
There might still be some vegetable
fields. l'll go check.
Come here, Mimi!
Toward Finis Terra...
The Gate of Life and Death...
Mr. Morisaki, look!
Looks like I've found tonight's dinner...
See?
Some potatoes might be poisonous,
so just in case...
I'll remove the poison with water!
And also, your clothes...
Yours are pretty dirty too, you know.
I'll wash them afterwards,
so please get changed.
Potatoes, yay!
These are good.
Thank goodness there was still
some salt left in the kitchen.
I'm surprised.
Is this journey fun for you?
I...
Whenever I listened to the radio,
I felt like there was a far off world
I had to get to somewhere.
''This is not where l belong. There is
a place I've never seen before... ''
Then l met a mysterious boy, and
chased him all the way here...
Ever since l came to Agartha, my heart
has been racing for some reason...
That's why I'm sure that ahead
of here, something...
Um...
Not being able to see the stars at night
makes me somewhat uneasy...
It makes you realiza just how
solitary human existence is.
Shin Canaan Praeses.
As for the recovery of the clavis,
we laud your service.
But you have made a grave error.
A man and girl have come from
the surface with clavis in hand,
making pace toward the Gate
of Life and Death.
What? But l have the clavis right here...
Theirs is a different fragment.
You stood there and foolishly allowed those
Topsiders entrance into Agartha...
This was a grave error.
But the task which l was given was only...
Out with such excuses! Do not waste
your breath. Don't you understand?
Our days of prosperity are long past, and
we are living the long days of twilight.
Our wish now is to fade away into
Astral, the endpoint of life itself.
But every time a gate is opened,
Topsiders come and press in upon Agartha,
throwing our peaceful existence into turmoil...
We shan't ever forget the suffering we once
endured, be it even for a moment.
Such a pity.
Facing the coming of age ceremony,
your eyes are as of yet not open.
Unable to peer into the vision
of the Quetzal Coatl...
Unsuited to sense the breath of the clavis!
Your brother had natural gifts.
But his soul was weak, and his yearning
for the surface grew ever stronger.
Shin Canaan Preases,
l give you a new task.
Shin!
Seri! Aren't you in the middle of a task?
Just a short break isn't a problem.
Seri, about Shun...
I know.
It's a shame.
No... Even if the illness was hastened,
I'm sure that Shun saw what he wanted to.
Shin... You have another task, yes?
Yes. l have to find the Topsiders
and confiscate their clavis.
But that's...
It's not like I was told I had to kill them.
But if I have to...
How awful, making you do such
a dangerous task all by yourself!
After our parents died, the people
of the village raised us.
I have to repay that debt.
Eat.
Thank you very much...
Maybe we should make some soup?
Here.
What is it?
You seem to be getting along
all of a sudden.
Well, if it comes down to it,
we can use the cat for food.
I'm joking.
Mr. Morisaki... lt's like you're my... dad.
Don't be silly.
How rare for you to get a fever.
I thought it was my job
to fall ill all the time.
I'm sorry.
If you feel thay way, can you
promise me something?
What?
Even when l'm gone, promise me
you'll keep on living a good life.
Lisa, my next mission will be over soon.
After l get back, let's go back
to my country together.
If we do that, the your illness
will definitely get better...
That's not what I asked.
Listen... All people pass on sometime.
The only difference is whether
it comes sooner, or later.
And I'm just going a bit before you...
There's no changing that.
Lisa...
Don't say that.
You aren't going to leave me,
and l am never going to leave your side.
I would never prepare for your absence...
For certain...
Lisa, are you there?
Um... Mr. Morisaki, you seemed like
you were uncomfortable, so I...
Asuna... Did l say something?
No...
A rainbow.
They're heading toward the
land where the lzoku dwell.
I must hurry!
Got it!
I see...
So the scenery that l would see while listening
to the radio was part of Agartha...
Let's go, Asuna. On a journey to know
what it means to say goodbye.
It's okay, don't cry. You're all right.
Any luck?
What should we do?
What's wrong?
They're gone.
I see the clavis!
They can't go out from the shadows!
Come here!
It's okay, come here!
Climb!
Climb!
Please, you can do it!
Grab on!
Asuna!
Come!
You're... Shin?
Looks like you got it right this time.
This is a nest of lzoku.
They will devour you and you r
so called defiled blood.
We're getting out of here!
Shin! How did you know we were here?
Um, after we last met, I chased
after you into Agartha!
And that's cause me a whole
lot of trouble, thank you!
What? l just wanted to see you again...
Don't talk, just run!
They're coming after you!
I am running!
Shin! Shin, they're coming!
Asuna, jump!
Shin!
Shin!
You okay?
Let's go!
Asuna, you have a fragment
of a clavis, right?
Yeah...
You should hand it over to me.
Shin!
Shin!
I have to save him.
Hold it, little guy!
Asuna!
Hey, Asuna!
Asuna...
A horse?
He told you to give him the clavis?
It doesn't seem like those things
that snatched you off
were planning to give us a nice welcome.
And what'll we do with her?
What is it?
Something's over there?
Downstream?
Shin!
You're covered in sweat!
Asuna?
Shin!
You're safe, too?
Thank goodness. You're conscious...
Ah, right... We were swept away...
Wait, l'll get you water.
You!
You're from Arch Angel!
I know you have a clavis.
Leave it here and get out of Agartha!
Why?
How should I know?
This is what l've been tasked with!
Hand over the clavis!
Let's go where she pointed.
There might be a village there.
I'm bringing him with us.
Do as you wish.
There are people here!
The first living village.
Let's go, but watch yourself.
Dear...
It couldn't be...
They're Topsiders.
Really?
A bad omen...
I hope everything's okay...
Everyone, stand back!
It's the defiled child that was kidnapped
the day before yesterday.
The one who can no longer speak
after her mother passed away.
Halt!
Dinah's child, yes?
She sure has grown.
Thank you for bringing
our village's child back.
But you are Topsiders from the surface.
Our village of Amaurot
cannot accept Topsiders.
Please turn back.
U Um, could you at least take
a look at this person?
Those clothes... He's from Canaan?
He's injured, and he has a fever.
Those clothes... He's from Canaan?
He's injured, and he has a fever.
He's injured, and he has a fever.
Why is someone of Agartha with
those from the surface?
Why is someone of Agartha with
those from the surface?
I cannot.
Begone!
Wait!
Manna, l'm so happy you've come back!
Please, forgive my village's rudeness.
Not a word of thanks for saving
my granddaughter, eh?
Old Master!
Just for one eve... Must l suffer
the dishonor of not even doing that much?
This way.
Bringing you through the village would
cause you to stand out too much.
His fever will break soon.
Although it will be a little while before
he is able to move again.
He'll live, so there is no need for worry.
Thank goodness.
This is all thanks to you...
That was a wound from the lzoku, yes?
Izoku?
They hate both light and water...
They're a cursed tribe.
But they are part of the structure that maintains
this world in its current state.
That is why they hate it so when the
two sides are mixed together.
Mixed together?
So, that child...
Manna's father is a Topsider.
Things such as that happen not oft.
Get out of our village!
Get out!
I apologize, Miss...
But the coming of Topsiders is not
looked upon as a good omen to us.
Asuna.
In the past,
kings and emperors from the surface
came to steal the wealth and wisdom
of Agartha for hundreds of years.
The kings needed Agartha's
knowledge and treasure
to rule over the surface, you see.
And what they brought in return
were countless wars...
We were more glorious than
anywhere on the surface.
But our cities were all destroyed,
and our birth rate dwindled.
Now there are but a handful
of villages that remain.
And so we shut the gates with the clavises,
locking them to prevent anyone
from the surface from entering.
I'll show you to my archive.
Will you help me prepare dinner there, miss?
Yes.
This way.
Mimi...
Manna...
What next, Elder?
Would you cut up that bigroot for me?
Sure.
You mean this?
Yes...
A daikon...
Hey, Mimi!
I've never seen a Yadoriko get along
so well with a Topsider before.
Yadoriko? You mean a cat?
Animals in which reside God's children.
Raised along with humans,
after they serve their purpose,
they become one with the Quetzal Coatl
and live on for eternity.
God ...
Isn't it nice to be mistaken for such a
wonderful creature like that, Mimi?
Now then, would you give Manna
a bath before dinner is ready?
A bath?!
Baths are amazing...
Hey Manna, hold it!
Mr. Morisaki...
How do you like this outfit?
I borrowed it from the Elder.
It doesn't suit you.
Don't cry while you eat.
But it's so delicious!
Elder, l was wondering if you could
answer my question from earlier.
It is forbidden to bring back
the dead here in Agartha.
If it is forbidden, that means there is a way.
Life and death are just part of the
flow of something much bigger.
Those humans who wish to interrupt
that flow shall not be permitted.
Permitted?
Why? Whose permission must I ask?
Elder, even we on the surface
know such platitudes.
What l want to know is where and how
one can reunite with lost loved ones.
That's all.
Grieving over the dead is proper,
but to continue to pity them is erroneous.
You should not have involved a girl of such
youth in your own delusional fallacy.
Asuna came here of her own free will!
Um! I...
All you do is sit here, staring up at the gods,
locked up in this cellar for 2,000 years!
Miss, I apologize,
but can you look after the boy?
Go.
Okay.
Those clothes don't suit you at all.
That's not a nice thing to say!
Why did you do it?
Why did you save me?
Because you saved me, too.
I was just forced to clean up after my brother.
Shun?
Shin!
Don't force yourself...
You can't stay here.
Damn it...
I should have let the lzoku kill you,
then taken your clavis.
No, l should have killed those
Arch Angels on the surface.
Leave.
Shin?
I said leave!
We'll leave early tomorrow.
Get right to sleep.
l'm sorry.
I can't shelter Topsiders for long.
I've said what I could to him.
Tonight, at least,
sleep together with Manna.
Mimi.
Brother...
Everyone set out on their journey
as a heartfelt cry for help.
If only somebody had been able to stop them...
Our time together made me feel like
my daughter had returned to me.
Elder...
Manna, take care!
The boat should get you across the
lake in two days and one night.
From there,
you will be near the place you seek.
You have my thanks for all that you've done.
Asuna.
Mimi, come here.
Hey, we're going...
Mimi?
I think the little one has fulfilled its duty.
People cannot decide
what the Yadoriko do, see.
But...
I thought we'd always be together!
Mimi!
Mimi!
Asuna, you just have to accept it.
Elder, please...
Mimi!
Mr. Morisaki, wait! l still...
Mimi!
Manna, take care of Mimi!
Mimi, listen to what Manna says, okay?
Farewell...
Mr. Morisaki...
Do you remember what you said in class?
About the myth of lzanagi and lzanami?
Yes...
l was curious about the end ,
so l read the rest in the library.
What lzanagi saw at the bottom of the earth
was a frightful, rotten visage of his wife.
Even so, is it right to bring back
someone from the dead?
We're close to the end of our journey.
You must decide yourself what you
seek at the Gate of Life and Death.
A light? People?
No.
Izoku!
Don't worry,
they shouldn't be able to reach us here.
The part it played in this world is over,
and it is time for it to pass on to the next.
Cry for it all you can.
For her sake, as well...
What's that?
It will be here soon.
Quetzal Coatl!
And a really ancient one, too...
And in that way, it becomes
part of an even larger life...
I wonder if Asuna thinks of it that way?
Even though something precious
to her has died...
Elder, perhaps it is because the world
of Agartha has learned too much
about how shor and meaningless
life is in the present...
Isn't that why it has begun
to fall into ruin?
Your naiveté is quite similar to
that Topsider man.
They have longbarrels with them!
Are they going to stop them,
even if they have to kill them?
The same task which you bear.
What will you do?
I don't know.
But...!
I will repay my debt!
Everyone has left...
It's over that ridge.
We must hurry before the lzoku come out.
Asuna...
Can you hear that?
The soldiers from Amaurot!
Run!
Hide! I'll finish this quick.
Mr. Morisaki!
They're trying to kill us now!
Shin?
I didn't ask for you to butt in!
Don't kill anyone.
You'll just increase Agartha's hatred.
The boy from Canaan?
Why do you cover for the Topsiders?
Those two saved a girl from your village.
You should owe them a debt of gratitude!
lf we leave the Topsiders be,
they will become the catalyst for ruin.
We cannot allow this root of
evil in the future.
Move!
I've paid back my debt... Go now!
Shin!
You're not bad.
Please, allow me.
It's the end of this world... Finis Terra.
The Gate of Life and
Death is at the bottom of this cliff.
Hurry...
Don't let his actions go to waste.
Lose as much weight as you can.
We're climbing down to the bottom.
But...
I can't! lsn't there some other way...
There's no time for that.
When the sun sets,
the lzoku will come out.
Let's go.
Mr. Morisaki!
Asuna!
Asuna.
Listen to me.
You crossed through the Interstitial Sea,
and came this deep into the world .
I know you will be able to
get past this cliff.
Remember why you came to Agartha!
But... But, this place is...
I... can't do it.
Enough of this.
You have lost your place in Agartha.
I never had one to begin with!
I understand. I'll go on alone.
Hand over the clavis.
In exchange, you carry this.
Go back upstream along the river,
and aim for the Elder's place.
When night falls,
enter the water to escape from the Izoku.
Asuna. l want you to live.
I know this is selfish of me,
but please remember that for me.
The clavis has disappeared
down into Finis Terra.
We can pursue it no further.
But there is no way for the Topsiders
to survive descending that cliff.
Boy, neither Agartha nor the surface...
No place can provide you
rest or peace any longer.
You have chosen to wander
aimlessly for all eternity.
Think on that, and repent.
I'm sorry for forcing you to gallop so far...
Can you stand?
Where should l go now?
Asuna...
Ruins?
Damn it!
The defiled...
Kill... Devour...
Defiled... Devour...
Asuna...
I'll give you a blessing.
Mom, what's a blessing?
A blessing?
'' I'll give you a blessing. ''
Did someone say that to you?
Yeah...
It's like how happy l was that
you were born, Asuna.
I think that's a blessing.
Hey, Asuna!
Want to walk home together?
Asuna!
I'm sorry about you getting involved, Asuna.
Why did you save me?
Just how solitary human existence is...
I will repay my debt!
Asuna!
Why?
Why have you come to Agartha?
Why?
It's just because...
I was so lonely.
No...
Lisa...
I'll see you soon.
Soon...
The water is gone!
When did...
Defiled...
Kill...
Wait here!
Devour the defiled...
I...
I... have to live...
Asuna!
The dawn is breaking.
It's good you're safe, Asuna.
Yeah...
Thank you for saving me, Shin.
I never properly thanked you before,
have I?
Really? My body just moved on its own.
I wasn't really thinking about trying
to save you or anything.
What?
The color of your eyes is a
little different than Shun's.
Yeah . And my brother was taller,
and his hair was a slightly different color, too.
What are you, a kid?
So are you!
You really aren't Shun, after all...
Are you still...
Because...
Because...
Don't cry!
Brother...
Shakuna Vimana!
It's heading to the Gate of Life and Death.
That's where Mr. Morisaki is...
That Arch Angel guy made it?
Vimana is the ark that carries life itself!
Finis Terra!
I thought l'd gotten a lot farther away...
I must have gone around in
circles during the night.
Quetzal Coatl!
Asuna, this Quetzal Coatl is...
You know?
It's probably come here to die.
Vita aqua! This is...
A graveyard of Quetzal Coatl!
This is...
the Gate of Life and Death?
A song?
Before they die,
the Quetzal Coatl do this...
They sing a song containing
all of their memories.
This goes out, changing the
form of things everywhere...
Without us noticing it, the vibrations in the
air enter our bodies and intermix within us.
By doing this, they make sure thei r
memories exist for eternity,
somewhere within the world.
I've heard this song before.
It's always stayed within me...
Asuna!
Shin, l have to go to Mr. Morisaki.
I think he might be in trouble alone.
But, the cliff...
It says that it will take us there.
Shakuna Vimana!
This is Agartha's... god.
State my wish?
I have never once forgotten these past
ten years, even for an instant.
I once truly tried to get past your death,
but it was no use.
I cannot find any meaning in
a world without you in it.
Lisa, return to my side!
Shin!
Stars!
These are... stars?
Shin, look!
Mr. Morisaki...
Lisa, is that you?
Why...
You say to offer you a living vessel
in which to place her soul?
Mr. Morisaki!
Asuna...
I didn't want you to show up here.
Asuna!
Asuna, what's the matter?
A soul of the dead is in Asuna's body...
You damn Arch Angel!
Did you choose this?
Asuna!
Don't give up your heart!
You won't be able to come back!
Asuna, Asuna!
It's cold...
Where are you?
Dear...
Lisa!
So that girl alone wasn't enough?
Dear...
Asuna...
Dear, are you there?
Asuna, snap out of it!
Arch Angel, give Asuna back!
Your eye...
It's too late,
I've already paid the price.
Lisa...
I'm right here.
Dear...
What is it?
It looks like you've grown a bit older...
I'm sorry, Lisa...
No, Asuna!
Asuna, come back!
That boy... I know him.
Asuna, come back!
That boy... I know him.
Asuna!
Asuna!
Why is it that my heart...
Lisa, stay here.
I'll be right back.
Asuna!
Asuna!
Asuna!
Please, stop this.
Lisa has done nothing wrong!
The living are more important!
Shin?
You're going, right, Asuna?
Yeah... Farewell.
Lisa!
Lisa...
I'm sorry, Dear.
I wasn't able to proyect you...
Lisa, no...
Don't go...
Lisa...
I love you.
I loved you!
Find... happ... iness...
Kill me.
Kill me, please.
I heard a voice telling me to live,
embracing the loss.
You should have heard it too.
It's the cure that we humans must bear.
But l think it's also... a blessing.
Hello, goodbye and hello.
l met you, and now l say goodbye.
Hello, goodbye and hello.
And hello to this world without you...


Back then, I didn't know
what it really meant to say goodbye...

It's the graduation ceremony, after all!
Right!
Mom...
I'm heading out!
Ever since I fell in love with you,
I've started this journey.
