Raghu!
Where is he?
Where are you wood stealer?
- Yes brother.
Until I don't abuse you,
you don't listen.
I thought that of the witch
palace, gobbled you up.
Did you finish the work?
It will be over tomorrow, brother.
He is going to arrive
today from America.
A bit of colour, a bit
of polish that's all.
But no, you have been working
on it for past one month..
..like there is no end to it.
What can I do, no one is ready
to work in this haunted palace.
I have gathered 4-5 artists.
But everyone runs away after..
..the sunset out of fear.
Tell me what to do?
Okay, okay.
When the cot is polished,
keep it there.
Does it look like a cot to you,
it is a bed, a royal bed.
When 5-6 strong men will use
their complete strength..
..only then will it budge.
Give me some money, I will call ..
..some people and take
care of it right now.
Did you water the garden
yesterday or not?
No, it was raining yesterday.
Then you could have held a
umbrella and watered it.
One is a wood thief and
the other, useless.
And don't make excuses, that
if you take more days..
..then you will earn more.
It is a royal family,
we will plunder it.
Thieves.
Did you sell the carpet here?
The rein is gone, so are the kings.
Now even the honour
is disintegrating.
Seems like I will have to get the
curtains that I gave for stitching.
They are not what they seem.
How much do I have to pay you Raghu?
How much?
Raghu.
Raghu!
Raghu!
Raghu!
Raghu!
Raghu!
He goes after that one and..
Mr. Nath! Mr. Nath!
Have you seen my Murari uncle?
No.
When he comes, ask him to come home.
The bucket has fallen in the well
it has to be taken out.
Okay, I will tell him.
Don't forget it.
- I won't.
Sir, sir. You have arrived
at the right moment.
It was a good game going on..
..when the English men
started mumbling again.
Please tell us what the score is?
197 runs and 3 wickets.
We should ban this
English language..
..nothing can be understood.
Do you know, unknowingly how
much English you speak.
You don't even know the Hindi
meaning of some English words.
Tell me, what do you call
cricket in Hindi?
Cricket is called..
So son-in-law, what's going on?
The same old argument between
Hindi and English.
Hind, Hindi is the best.
How do you write cat in English.
- How?
C A T. How do you pronounce it?
Cat. What does it mean?
Cat.
Now in Hindi, they read, write
and mean it in the same way.
Good, good.
But Sanskrit is the mother
of all languages.
Now tell me this.. Mood
talam kunchika kim.
What will it mean in Hindi?
Think, I will go to the college.
The question is wrong itself.
Mood talam. That means
a foolish lock.
A lock cannot be either
foolish or smart.
A lock is a lock.
A key is a key.
Like the key to the
manor that I have.
Now..
The manor keys.
"Hail Rama! Hail Rama!
"Rama Rama Hail Hail!"
"Hail Krishna! Hail Krishna!"
"Krishna Krishna Hail Hail!"
Murari, why are you
dancing off-beat?
What happened?
Nandini has been searching for
you, do you know. - Why?
The bucket has to be taken out
of the well. Go! Hurry up!
Then I will have to go.
Or else sister-in-laws rituals
will be left incomplete.
Okay, bye.
"Hail Rama! Hail Rama!
"Rama Rama Hail Hail!"
Mr. Batuk, what are you
doing sitting here?
Where are you going?
- Mr. Batuk, I was coming to you.
What happened, did you retrieve it?
I was thinking should I go now
and retrieve it, or not.
How did you know?
Me. How wouldn't I know!
Your daughter told me.
My daughter.
- Yes.
How did she know?
Sister-in-law must have told her.
She knows it too, now
she will scold me.
It is a personal thing,
why are you worried.
I will take it out, come on.
Brother Murari, you are very brave.
- You just come with me.
I was thinking of retrieving
it tomorrow.
But I was very restless.
It is the humid season, that's why.
Pour 10 buckets of cold water
saying 'Hail Gange'.
You will feel very nice,
our work will be done.
Tell me one thing, won't you
be scared in the darkness.
What is there to be scared of, I
just have to jump in the well.
In the well, why in the well?
The bucket is in the well.
Bucket? -Yes.
The keys are in the manor.
Then what do I have to take
out, key, bucket or well.
You fool, my keys are in the manor
I have to get that back!
Keys.
- Yes
In the manor.
- Yes.
Right now.
- Yes.
In this darkness.
No, I am not coming.
You were acting very brave,
now I will not let you go.
Come on, come on.
- No! No!
Why are you walking
around in circles?
I have asked for a protection
shield from the junior priest.
I have been standing
here since morning.
Now I cannot even sit.
My stomach is getting restless.
The 1000 name recitation is
going on, it will take time.
I hope I am not too late.
It will take time.
Batuk.
- Priest, priest.
What you saw was true.
That witch is really roaming
around in the manor.
Your lifeline was long, that's
why you returned alive.
But I have enslaved many
dangerous ghosts.
Respected Yogi, my teacher has
blessed me with his grace.
Tie this talisman on the tree
in the south side of the manor.
That witch will turn to ashes.
Om!
Do you want to say anything
for the last time?
Last time, why are you hanging
me by the noose?
From taking talisman in your hand
and until tying it to the tree..
..you cannot say anything.
Then what about the work..
- Quiet!
Shut your mouth! Om!
Om!
Mr. Batuk, where did you
disappear to last night?
I was tired of searching for you,
but you were no where to be seen.
Okay, if I wouldn't have been there
you would have been more scared.
You are still not saying anything.
No, no now will know
about your scare.
I am keeping my lips sealed.
What?
Which is this dance
that you are doing?
What happened?
You want to sit at the back.
Seems like you have lost your mind..
..after seeing the witch
last night, right
What?
What has happened?
What are you writing?
Stomach upset, let's go home.
Oh! So you want to go now.
I thought you must have soiled
your clothes last night.
Am going, I will take you.
Sister-in-law! Janki sister-in-law.
What is it?
- Why are you shouting?
Forget about me, tell me did Batuk
tell you anything last night?
No, he came home late scared and
went back early in the morning.
That means he didn't say anything.
He didn't open his mouth.
My suspicion was right.
After last nights incident in the
manor, he has lost his voice..
..like Madan's daughter, Girja.
Oh God, what happened in the manor?
What I said?
Many a times I have told him not
to go to the manor in the night.
But he doesn't listen to me at all.
Where is he right now,
in the hospital?
Didn't you see, he just
went running in.
Cheeks blown up. Red eyes,
and he was walking as if..
..someone has cast him on a stick.
Take a look at him when he comes.
Listen, what happened?
How many times have I asked you not
to go to the manor in the night!
But you don't listen to me at all!
Tell me! What happened?
Say something.
Brother Murari, what
is he saying now?
Did you see sister-in-law,
since morning he has been..
..dancing like this out of tune.
1 or 2 won't do any good.
We will have to get him
10-12 electric shocks.
He is insane since childhood.
Brother Murari, look
where is he going?
I will see where will he go?
I will got to brother Badri and
take the veneration talisman.
Give me.
- Take it, take it, take it.
Take it, take it, take it.
- I will break your teeth.
Ask your future husband, instead
of printing poems, print notes..
..it will be useful
in your marriage.
Take it ..Will you give it or not?
What's going on, is this
a house or a playground?
Nothing, nothing.
- Runaway from here.
Brother, I want to talk to you.
- What is it Janki?
So it has happened!
I had said, don't be greedy!
Taking the manors responsibility,
will not benefit you, I had told you.
I don't know how your husband
must have persuaded Siddharth..
..and swindled his money for
the repairs of the manor.
And he must have kept
half of the money.
But under no condition will
I let him live in that manor.
He is coming from America.
After Kedar, he is the heir
to the royal throne.
We will have to protect him.
And we have to get her and
Siddharth married too.
She has been hoping for that
for such a long time.
After Siddharth marries her, we
will sell the haunted manor.
Save my husband, brother.
I will give a thread chanting
some recitations.
Tell Batuk Shankar to
wear it for 3 days.
But will he wear it if I give it?
You are looking so beautiful.
Your cheeks are rosy red.
In the happiness of Siddharth's
arrival, isn't it?
Here, and tie it firmly
around Batuk's stomach.
And until this is not done
keep your mouth shut.
Strange, you were supposed to come..
..yesterday, but
arrived today itself.
Actually we had arrived last night.
We went straight to the
palace, it was open..
..the lock was hanging and
the key was there too.
We went inside but there was no one.
It was quite late in the night,
so we stopped in the hotel.
I thought why I should trouble you.
As soon as it was morning,
I came here.
Last night you had
entered the palace.
We did.
Avni, why are you standing
there come in.
This is my surprise for you.
It has been 10 days to our marriage.
Greetings.
Why are you all so shocked, don't
you want to welcome daughter-in-law?
Yes.
Uncle, I had said after father
he played the role of father.
Bless you.
Radha, you have grown up.
And beautiful too.
There wasn't a single day
when we didn't argue.
If we fought today, we would
become friends the next day.
I've heard a lot about you.
Janki aunt, how are you?
How is uncle?
Today is her oath of silence.
She has the sacred thread.
Janki, go home. Go.
Brother Kedar was
a great astrologer.
According to him, your
and Radha's horoscope..
..was like made for each other.
All of us wanted you to marry Radha.
I know, mother had told me.
For how many days
have you come here?
For some months.
My company has got a contract..
..of building a dam here.
So I had to come.
So Avni was very excited.
She will see around here, and
I will toil day and night.
Okay, you can live in Chandu's room.
Uncle, we want to live in the manor.
Avni likes manors and
palace's very much.
That's why we got
the manor repaired.
Look Siddharth, according
to the division..
..even though you are the
owner of the manor..
..but we live here.
That manor is infested
by ghost and ghouls.
Uncle, you believe in your faith..
..and I believe only in the truth.
When I will experience it,
I will believe it.
Protect me Lord Shiva.
Wow, now you can use your tongue.
Now I will use my
hand too, deserter!
You ran away scared, and were
telling everyone that I was scared.
You're going to shock me.
Mother!
Mother!
Mother!
- But you..
No.. no.. have mercy mother!
Murari uncle, she is
Siddharth's wife.
Sister-in-law Avni.
Greetings.
- Greetings.
Go away! Go away you witch, go away!
Have you developed a new
habit of scaring people?
Why are you closing the door?
I will come home.
Say something. What is it?
Kiss, I will not give it here.
I won't give it here no
matter what you do?
Stop! Stop!
Finished.
Nandini saw everything.
Tell her that you were
tying a talisman..
..or else who knows what
she might think. Go!
Only a king can stay in this palace.
After brother Kedar, you are
the real heir to this throne.
But you have still
not been coroneted.
Uncle, the kings are gone
and so are the British.
Now there is democracy in India.
If the reign is over, is
the family finished too.
I left all that behind in America.
Do you believe in rituals..
..or did you leave that
behind in America too?
I do, I believe in them uncle.
You are my king, uncle.
I will do what you ask me to.
Unbelievable!
You are really a king, my king.
Come on Siddharth, dance with me.
Siddharth.
"The king felt in love
with the queen."
A gift for the king,
to make me the queen.
What good is this for
such a big king?
"Kiss me on my lips."
"What are you, tell me now."
"Surrender yourself in my arms..
I I
..in my arms, in my arms.
"The intoxicating fragrance in your
emotions, in your fragrant breath."
"I have a desire to sleep in your
silky arms, your scattered breath."
"Hide the face with another one."
"Let me hear your heartbeat."
"See yourself, in my eyes..
I I
..in my eyes, in my eyes.
"Kiss me on my lips."
"What are you, tell me now."
You have turned our
room into a library.
I am a book worm.
I read two books a day.
But I need a good room
to keep these books.
I will show you, but what
will I get in return?
Book. What do you like?
Stories, history or poetry?
Poetry.
Remember, I am giving you the
reward before the work is done.
Here.
My most favourite poetry's.
This, sister-in-law
are you teasing me?
No, these are really
very nice poems.
As if you don't know anything.
- No, what?
Nandini, listen.
You are shying so much, tell me.
My marriage has been fixed.
With Sharad Prahlad.
He is my favourite poet.
He is a lecturer in our college.
Then he surely writes a lot of
poetry on you, isn't it?
Come I will show you?
- What?
There.
He lives there.
The one that's strolling there?
The library room. - Yes, come on.
Why is there a chain here?
We are not allowed to go up there.
But why?
They say there are ghosts there.
- Ghosts.
We don't even come in this palace.
Sister-in-law.
No sister-in-law.
- Come on.
I will not come. Come on.
Sister-in-law, don't go.
Let us see, who is living in our
house without our permission
Come on.
Come on.
What is this?
The Bhairav shield.
So that the ghost doesn't come out.
Come on, sister-in-law.
- Really?
Don't laugh sister-in-law, this
place is really dangerous.
In the childhood, we were
playing hide and seek..
..and Girja came here to hide.
Then we heard her scream.
When we came up and searched for
her, she was nowhere to be found.
But when Badri uncle and father
searched for her in the evening..
..she was found unconscious
right here.
Since then she has stopped talking.
Everyone says that she has
been taken over by ghosts.
Come sister-in-law,
we will go from here.
Where is the key to this lock?
With my father, but don't even
think about asking for it.
You are excused everything,
and I will be thrashed.
Think about it, I have another
good book of your Sharad.
Do you want it?
- Really.
Nandini!
Nandini!
Nand..
Come here! You come here!
You know it, don't you?
Daughter-in-law is new
here but you know..
..that it is not allowed
to go to the third floor.
Have you lost your senses?
Daughter-in-law.
- Yes.
Remember one thing.
65 years ago, all the rooms
of that floor were closed..
..with magic and mantra.
Two souls reside there.
Educated people will make fun of it.
But nowadays, foreign scientists
have started believing in it.
It has ruined many of our lives.
And this is true. What is the use in
challenging the souls of the dead?
All these veneration and offerings
is for those two souls.
But who were those two people?
It is a very old story.
Years ago, king Vibhuti Narayan.
Meaning, your Siddharth's
ancestors..
..he used to rule here.
He was a great admirer of art.
He had a very big court.
Well known singers, dancers,
poets, painters..
..were in his court.
Many foreign artists would
come and leave with riches.
Then came Bengal's great
dancer, Manjulika.
They say she was very
gorgeous looking.
The old king fell for her.
Vibhuti Narayan was floored.
The king would neither care
for the kingdom or his reign.
But Manjulika loved someone else.
- The royal singer.
Her name was Shashidhar.
The house that is behind our
palace, he used to live there.
Their love started developing slyly.
But the aroma of clarified butter
and love, can never be hidden.
The king found out about it.
The night both of them
were about to flee..
..the king called Manjulika
to dance in his court.
It was the eight day of the
Goddess Durga veneration.
Manjulika was dancing.
Suddenly, the king drew his sword..
..and beheaded Shashidhar
in front of everyone..
..and locked up Manjulika.
The king started the preparations
for the marriage.
The dias was setup, the
arrangements were made.
As the slaves went up
to bring the bride..
..they found her hanging
from the ceiling.
And along was a letter.
In that she had sworn,
that she will ..
..never let a king live
in this palace.
After that it seemed like someone
has cast an evil eye..
..on the kings kingdom.
There was destruction
in the kingdom.
One day the king was found dead too.
Then a very big sorcerer was called.
Mantras were recited for
7 days continuously.
And by putting the Bhairav
shield both the souls..
..were locked on the third floor.
Since then no one goes there.
Do you know who lives in
Shashidhar's house now?
Who?
- Sharad, Nandini's future husband.
ls this entire story or a reality.
I don't know, there are such
secrets in every king's kingdom.
It is a nice story.
- Very interesting.
The villagers must have made
it for their entertainment.
You know, your mother had said..
..that there is a very big
treasure in this palace.
There are gold and
diamond jewels too.
I looked all around the palace,
but I couldn't find it.
Maybe it is hidden in that room.
And I feel, they must have made
this story to hide that treasure.
Can I open that room?
It is your house, do
whatever you like.
Avni!
Avni!
That was not the right
thing to do Avni.
Father had said no, still
you opened the door.
I opened it and also saw it.
I couldn't see any ghost there.
You must have not seen it, because
the effect has started.
The blacksmith who made
the keys, he has died.
Do you know what you have done?
00010 01:41:30:04 01:41:31:06 You!
You cannot even take care of a key..
..how will you carry out the
responsibility of the palace!
Your daughter stole your key
and made a duplicate one..
..and Siddharth's wife opened
the lock of the door.
Couldn't you even think once?
Nandu! Nandu! Nandu! Always Nandu!
What are you doing,
she is just a child.
Just because they can
talk in English..
..they think that they can
interfere in any matter.
Years ago she had gone to the 3rd
floor, she is still shocked.
Who knows what will happen now?
Sister, is everything
fine? Any problem?
It has come, or is about
to come we don't know.
What are you looking at
me for standing here..
..go and call the high priest! Only
he can save us from this problem!
You said yes, now face
the consequences!
I told you, I don't believe
in these things.
Then go to the crematorium and see.
The blacksmith is lying on the pyre.
I have found out, that
drunkard blacksmith..
..died because of liver failure
and not because of a ghost.
Nandini is withering with fever.
You all must have scared her.
What happened, did you find out when
the high priest is going to come.
He has gone to London.
Oh God! To some college
called Trimurty.
Not Trimurty uncle, Trinity.
Trinity University. - Yes.
He has gone to read
some paper there..
..and no one knows when
he will return.
Lord Shiva.
But why has he gone to
London to read a paper?
You get all the papers
at the village square.
It means he has gone to teach there.
But, who is this gentleman?
He is a very big sorcerer.
Priest Yagyaprakash Bharti.
Years ago, his grandfather
priest Vedsagar..
..had put the Bhairav shield
and closed the door.
Priest Yagyaprakash must
be 15-16 years old..
..but he was intelligent.
He was his grandfather's aide.
Priest Yagyaprakash
is the only one..
..that can complete this ritual.
Until priest Yagyaprakash doesn't
put the Bhairav shield..
..on the door and closes it.
It is very dangerous to live here.
It is a strange maze of delusion,
blind faith and mental games.
Brother Badri, my heart
is very restless.
Nandini is about to get married.
And something inauspicious should
not happen before that.
Don't worry Batuk Shankar,
it's my responsibility.
If Siddharth wants to live here,
then all of us will live here.
Uncle..
- That's my duty.
You both are alone, it
is a new city for you.
If something happens, you
need the family close.
Whatever happens, we will
bear it together.
Make arrangements for everyone
to come here. - Yes brother.
Your saris are very beautiful.
You can keep whichever you want,
they are all yours.
Maid, call the tailor.
We will have the blouse stitched.
- Yes.
Then you can wear them
whenever you want.
Poison.
It is for the rats.
They must have infested
the empty house.
Leave it, it's dangerous.
Maid.
- Yes.
Keep this poison in the kitchen
carefully. - Yes. Thank you.
Who is it?
Who is there?
- I am Manjulika!
You kept me locked up
for so many years!
How dare you?
Run! Run!
Who is it?
Who?
Siddharth! Siddharth!
Siddharth get up!
Siddharth!
- What happened?
Siddharth!
You know that santi?
- Who santi?
That maid, she is crying of fear.
- What happened?
She says that she has seen
the ghost. - What nonsense?
Come on quickly.
What happened?
She saw something and was scared.
What did you see?
I was sleeping right here.
Suddenly I woke up.
A sound anklets was coming
from somewhere.
When I looked, it was her
Scattered hair.
She was peeking from the hole.
You were saying that there
was darkness outside.
What can you see clearly
in the darkness?
What were you thinking
while sleeping?
It is all your illusion.
What happened?
- What happened?
Who broke it!
How is all this happening?
Who is doing all this?
It is black magic.
Someone has cast a spell.
Stop your nonsense!
All these things cannot happen
without someone doing it.
Talking all lies.
Ghosts and ghouls, magic spells,
go inside all of you!
Close the door and go to sleep!
Walk in a group. Walk in a group.
I am not ashamed to
say that I am scared.
Walk in a group. Walk in a group.
Chandu, who has appointed
these servants.
Mother has, but what happened?
What happened, first ask
aunt to fire that maid!
I don't want anyone who spreads
rumours about the palace.
What is all this commotion,
what has happened?
Some strange things are happening.
Someone is playing a dirty trick.
But what has happened?
Nothing, I was.. - The maid
saw the palace's ghost there.
There.
What's happening?
Are you fine?
Siddharth! Siddharth!
Who must have broken all this?
I had shot so many things in this!
Our arrival, your coronation.
Say something Siddharth.
I opened that door, that's why
all this is happening isn't it?
Why will this ghost named Manjulika
break our video camera?
Surely there is something.
- I am also sure of it.
Uncle I want to talk to you.
Do you still want to say something?
All that happened in front
of you in the palace..
..isn't that enough
as evidence for you.
The worst is about to come.
I request to you, be sensible
and let's go from here.
You are saying it without knowing
what happened and who did it, uncle!
I know what the reality is, and
that's what I have come to tell you!
When it's time to run you
are searching for maps.
Uncle, you don't understand.
What happened? What happened?
Avni, what happened?
Open your eyes, Avni.
Chandu, quickly call the doctor.
Call the doctor.
Quickly make a call.
- Pick her up quickly.
Take her to the hospital.
- Call the doctor otherwise
it will be too late.
Pick her up.
Take her to the room.
Avni! Avni! Avni! Avni! Avni!
Avni!
Avni!
Are you fine?
Are you fine?
What happened? How did this happen?
I don't know.
Suddenly my veil started burning.
Ask Radha, she saw it.
When I saw, the veil was burning.
Lord Shiva.
She is saved.
Please you people..
Go, bring a sari.
Uncle, I want to talk to you.
What is it?
Uncle, if you don't mind
can I ask you something?
Tell me clearly what you want to.
Uncle, I wanted to ask..
how is Radha?
Does she have any mental ailment
or any mental tension?
Adopted children can
have mental ailments.
Had something happened before?
It is not something to hide,
nor to feel shy.
Mental ailments can be treated.
We will call a good doctor.
Keep quiet, are you in your senses.
What are you saying?
These are the deeds of your wife
with modern thoughts and yours.
And you are blaming my daughter.
If we say anything to you, you
don't want to believe it.
Will you believe it?
Last night, we have touched death
and returned back alive.
Me, Murari and Natwar
had gone there.
Thinking that let the priest
come at his own time..
..before that we will perform
the veneration ..
..and keep the auspicious pot.
Do you know, we heard
Manjulika's voice.
We even heard the sound
of her anklets.
Now say that the three
of us are mad..
..and put us in a mental asylum.
So you have seen the ghost too.
Fools are never called intelligent.
Because he has never
seen the sunlight.
Don't feel bad about my anger.
I am talking about everyone's
betterment.
And your betterment is in
that you pack your bags..
..and come to my manor. Right now.
And please don't think
this is my misbehavior.
I am very strong of my principles.
Myself and Avni are
not going an_here.
I just want to do something
for Radha, let me do it.
What happened?
He is not ready to leave the palace!
What?
He is not ready to believe,
because of daughter-in-law..
..ghosts have been let
free in this palace.
He is telling me, that Radha
has some mental illness.
O God.
- You keep quiet.
Just because he said it
doesn't mean anything.
What could have happened to Radha?
Go and ask him! Your son-in-law.
It is a mental sickness, what else.
What happened now brother?
What happened?
This, this is the blouse that
you have made?! - Yes. Why?
Quit working as a tailor, your
method is wrong. - What happened?
Go take them back and stitch them
properly and bring them back.
I would have never cut it like this.
First I will cut one hand,
then the other.
And finally I will cut the throat,
understood or not?
Oh God!
What happened uncle, did
you have any work?
Brother Badri.
- What?
What?
What Siddharth said was right.
- What?
The palace's ghost has entered her,
it won't leave her easily.
I saw her, knife in the hand,
scattered hair..
..and she pounced on
to me with the knife.
Don't talk nonsense.
I am telling the truth.
You don't believe it,
come on I will show..
What happened?
- Nothing, you are absolutely fine.
Nothing has happened
to you, nothing.
Sit, sit.
Yes, keep swinging.
Day and night, just keep swinging.
You don't want to swing.
- It's okay you can stop.
Am I mad that I will keep
swinging all day?
Why are you crying, aunt?
Even mother has been
crying since morning.
Uncle!
- Nothing, nothing.
Why are you all staring at me?
You tell me, why is everyone
staring at me?
Tell me.
Someone tell me what's happening?
Tell me!
Hello, hello, hello may I speak
with Aditya Srivastav please?
Yes, its urgent.
This is his friend from
India, Siddharth.
Greetings madam, Mrs. Sharma
this is Siddharth here.
There was a very important thing,
I wanted to talk about a patient.
Yes, his..
I tried his mobile,
it is switched off.
He didn't answer my e-mail, that's
why I called the hospital.
Please give him the message
that the patients condition..
..is getting worse day by day. Ask
him to call me. It's urgent.
Okay, thank you ma'am.
Radha is not uncle Badri's daughter?
No, she has been adopted.
Radha's father was the
royal astrologer..
..and brother Badri's
very good friend.
After his death, she was
completely helpless.
Her mother had passed
away in her childhood.
Then brother Badri adopted her and
brought her up as his daughter.
You know, in childhood Siddharth
and Radha were very good friends.
Everyone wanted Radha and
Siddharth to get married.
Radha dreamt about that too.
But Siddharth married you
and Radha was heart broken.
The ghost has entered Radha.
That means, that old king must
be wandering somewhere around.
Troublesome ghost, don't trouble
me, don't trouble me.
Or else I will thrust this in,
I am telling the truth ..
..I will thrust it in.
Don't trouble me.
I am not from this family, I got
married that's why I am with them..
..I am not from this family.
Why are you troubling me?
No! No! No! No!
Don't come near me.
Don't come..
Don't come near me.
Don't come near me.
Don't come near me.
No! No!
No! No! No!
Don't come near me. No. No.
You were saying about him, isn't it?
He is in a very dangerous stage.
And why have you left him open?
Tie him to a pole.
Who is this beggar?
- Beggar.
Leave him, he is my uncle.
He could be, but he is ill.
No, he is not ill.
He started piercing me with the
umbrella calling me old king.
That's why I caught him.
Uncle he is my friend Aditya,
he has come from America.
He is a psychiatrist.
Ask him to treat himself first.
I am perfectly fine. Good that you..
..arrived on time, or else
he would have strangled me.
I am sorry.
Sorry.
This is the invention
of the English.
First commit a mistake and then say
sorry to commit another mistake.
When did you arrive?
And how did you manage
to reach here?
I called you so many times,
faxed you, e-mailed you..
..but you didn't reply to anything.
Where were you absconding?
And what is the new garb
that you have worn.
Nothing, I was in the Kumbh fair.
For the past 15-20 days I
have been taking a dip..
..and washing of my sins.
You cannot do that wearing jeans
and T-shirt. That's why.
My secretary informed me
that you had called..
..that's why I came
here running. And..
I have to pay the auto-rickshaw too.
Ramnath, how much do I have to pay?
- 13,000.
Repeat it louder.
- 13,000!
13,000. - Yes, I have come from
Allahabad in the auto-rickshaw.
Even I enjoyed driving it.
I told the driver to sit
behind and I'd drive.
I put the key in and started.
Patient.
Patient, patient.
Uncle, this is my friend Aditya.
He is psychic.. he is a
psychiatrist, uncle ..
"Hail Rama! Hail Rama!"
Greetings uncle.
My daughter is not insane.
-Yes uncle.
Please don't make her insane.
- Yes uncle.
"Hail Krishna! Hail Rama!"
And then when I drove the rickshaw.
And while driving it I..
"Hail Krishna! Hail Rama!"
Brother!
What happened?
I saw her, she ran away seeing me.
There is something wrong.
I can see in her eyes
something is wrong.
Whom did you see?
- That middle-aged one.
She will be fine, no matter.
You must have seen aunt
Janki and not Radha.
Everyone seems to be insane.
Have you opened a
mental asylum here?
It is not their fault, it
is because of your getup.
You look more like a impostor
than a doctor.
You know I get bored treating
patients in the hospital.
Whenever I get the chance I freak
out, wear such strange clothes.
Come on, freshen up quickly.
Introduce me to sister-in-law.
Yes, Avni.
- Avni.
Have you seen sister-in-law Avni?
- No.
Nandini listen.
- Yes.
I might have seen her
go up with a book.
Yes, she has gone up.
- Okay.
Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law Avni.
Sister-in-law.
Sister-in-law Avni.
Open this door.
It won't open like that, we
will have to break it. Come.
1 2 3.
Has the doctor arrived?
- Yes, he is inside.
Good.
Oh brother..
Who is he?
There has been blood loss.
That's why there will be
weakness for some days.
Otherwise, there is
nothing to worry about.
Everything will be fine.
How did you get seriously
wounded, dear?
I had gone up to look
for sister-in-law Avni.
I felt that someone is following me.
Who?
- I couldn't see anyone.
I reached the court running.
There suddenly, the
swing hit my head.
Like somebody had pushed it.
After that, I don't
remember anything.
But who told you that I am upstairs?
I was not there.
Sister Radha.
Radha?
Why, I had gone to take a bath.
Did you see this is the condition!
Since I have arrived, all
this has been going on.
What is it?
An ailment or something else.
The one who told her that she
is upstairs, but she was not.
That's our patient.
What did you say her name was?
- Radha.
Adha.
- Radha, and not Adha. - Radha..
This journey has clogged my mind,
First I will have to clear
it then it will work.
Where is my other bag?
Where did my other bag go?
Whoever has done this,
I'll not leave him.
One day I'll nab him.
Wow!
- Hey, stop!
Where is he going? He'll die. Look!
Mr. Ramlal, where are you going?
We are going to Shahpur.
Since when.
Has Mr. Yagyaprakash returned
from London or not..
..we are going to see that.
You can come along if you want.
Yes, come on, come on we
will have a lot of fun.
Not from here, the door
is at the back.
Sunder sweet-maker.
Did you get married?
Okay, you are going along
with sister-in-law.
Give me my bequest.
Priest, close the door we
are getting late. Greeting.
We'll give you money later.
Shut the door.
Come on, let's hurry!
Seems like he has gone
mad seeing Manjulika.
Taj mahal is right in front.
Junior priest, are you doing
penance sitting here?
Pushpa, where are you
going on your donkey?
Pushpa!
I am Murari, and not Pushpa.
Have you heard, Manjulika
has entered Radha's body!
People say that my behaviour
has changed.
Take a look at my face,
tell me how do I look?
Adit, what are you searching for?
Where is the bathroom?
All the ways look similar.
Name all the paths.
There goes king Siddharth road.
There goes queen Avni road.
That's Radha Square. Where
is the bathroom?
It is not that difficult?
After taking a right and a left,
the door that you will
see in the front..
..that is the bathroom.
But what will I wear?
The dirty clothes have been taken
for washing the clean clothes..
.. have been burnt.
What should I wear?
No, this is my house.
Do one thing, take a bath I will
send a loin-cloth for you..
..wear that today.
- Okay.
"Hail Shiv Shankar."
"Neither the thorn nor
the stone pierces you."
"I have drunk this in your name."
Who has taken my clothes?
These had been sent for me.
Who are you?
- Who are you?
In my house you are
asking me who am I?
How dare you?
You are that impostor of the
morning return me my clothes.
I have worn it, and it is
a bit drenched too. - What?
Do one thing, wear my towel.
You pig, bloody serpent.
You wore my clothes.
What good will abusing do?
What will I wear?
Give it back.
Take the towel off and come out,
I want to see you properly.
Scoundrel, useless, how dare you!
Great, you look beautiful.
Are you peeking inside?
Go!
Golden tresses, your tresses
touch your knees. Wow.
May you rot, don't you
have respect for women?
One thing is for sure,
we will have to meet..
..and there is no need
to circulate that.
I want to meet you,
and that too alone.
You scoundrel, swine,
may you rot to death.
Aren't you ashamed flirting with
a lonely girl? Return my clothes!
Quiet! Here! Here! Wear it!
Who is it?
ls someone there?
Where is it?
"I am yours."
"I am only yours."
"I am yours."
"I am yours."
"My desires will remain
in the breeze."
"It will stay alive, even
after being destroyed."
"I am yours."
"I am only yours."
"I am yours."
Marbles?
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait!
What are you doing here?
What?
- Bathroom.
Will you do it here?
- Yes..
..Here, will you do it here?
- No, in the bathroom.
Why did you run seeing me?
That..
- What?
I couldn't control it.
What, you couldn't control
your urine in the stomach.
Now it has come out,
the pant is wet.
No.
- Then?
Let me, I have to go badly.
And what of I would have
been hurt badly. - What?
You don't know.
No.
- You don't know.
Come on, let's urinate.
Come on.
- I will do it.
Come on. Hurry! Start pissing.
Come fast.
Start, come on.
I saw it, small one.
Small one.
It is not good to roam around
all night, understood.
Small one.
What happened, aren't you done yet?
ls it Niagara falls?
Small one.
Hey, small one..
Adi.
Adi, get up.
Thank you, what happened?
Did you sleep here the entire night?
Yes, the program was quite long.
Program, which program?
Tell me one thing, who
knows Bengali here?
No one.
But Radha had maybe studied
for some years in Kolkata.
Does she know classical music?
Does she know how to dance?
- No.
Then who was dancing all night
wearing the anklet? - Where?
On the third floor.
You heard it.
Heard it, but the artists door
was closed I couldn't see her.
By the way, who sleeps there?
Nobody.
And now the lock there is broken
too, no one goes there.
Can we go up and take a look.
Yes.
But if someone sees us, then
there will be a commotion.
Nothing will happen,
no one will know.
Come on, let us go.
- Yes. Just a minute.
Ok. It's done.
So this is that haunted closed room.
About which Siddharth
had told me about.
So he is the flirt king.
Look, look cruelty can be seen
on the face. He is a scoundrel.
Even the painter couldn't hide it.
Look at his eyes, bad intentions.
Full of lust, it can
be seen clearly.
And where is the other party?
The other, that Bengali dancer.
Do you have her photograph?
- Come, I will show you.
Adi.
- Yes.
Look.
Oh God.
No wonder the old king was
besotted, its my mistake forgive me.
Why are you saying that?
What a girl?! What a girl?!
I don't have any complaints
with that old king..
..that he snatched from
that Shashidhar.
Do you want to see
Shashidhar's house?
What? - Do you wish to
see Shashidhar's house.
Yes, show me. Then come.
Look.
Okay, so from there Shashidhar
used to look at Manjulika..
..and from here Manjulika used
to sing seeing him. That..
"I am yours."
"I am yours. I am only yours."
- Come here, I will show you
something interesting.
"I am only yours."
Look, look her sari.
Which she would wear while dancing.
And..
look, this pearl necklace.
This arm band.
So many jewels, which I have
never seen or heard of.
Look, anklets.
Where is it, it should
have been a pair.
