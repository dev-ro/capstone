We're at dispatching range
Ready the flyer squad
This is base, preparing formation
Repeat, preparing formation
Send out the alert! Level three emergency!
At once!
Are these guys wind element users?
It's chakra.
They're molding chakra into their wings
so the mists enable them to fly.
Sky ninja? So these are the Sky Ninja?
We're at our limits.
Just who exactly are these people?
The Second told me stones of people who excelled at manipulating chakra
to create new techniques for flying through the sky
They .formed the Sky Country
It's a horrible sight for them to be in Konoha as an enemy.
If that's really them could they be working
for an ally that wants to overthrow us?
If that's really them could they be working
for an ally that wants to overthrow us?
If that's really them could they be working
Anyone who targets the village of Konoha
no matter how incredible, will attract the whole Fire Country's revenge.
What the hell happened here?
Kid! Give me a hand!
Gimme the beam, old man...
Let's hurry him to the hospital.
Unfortunately, he has a punctured lung
At this rate, he wont make it to a hospital
So old man. you're a doctor then?
He has air leaking from his lungs into the pleural cavity
his chest can't handle it much longer. Quickly.
so down there?
There! Now he should be okay for you to take him to the hospital.
Take him? But I
Those guys are still out there though!
Concentrate on taking care of him.
I have to get to where those crows are flying around; the
area will be packed with people that need attention
Kitty.
Hey! are you calling me a kitty?
Yeah... and you'd be wise to take him there now.
Now I must continue my search for lives that need saving.
You'll return to the battle as soon after ."am I wrong?
And be careful with his chest!
Yo! Old Man!
How the hell did he know my name?
We've got to put out surveillance on those guys.
Neji, what do you know about them?
Their guns-are crafted with chakra
I see...
Judging from their current rate of chakra consumption
and their remaining chakra level
I'm guessing that we .can calculate how far they'll be able to fly their craft.
So it seems.
Tsunade-sama
You summoned us?
I'm unable to read this situation well.
From here, go tend to the people of Konoha
Shinobi from the Sky Country?
Sensei! These people need your care.
What's this?
This child is okay. Somebody saved him.
This one too.
Naruto also brought .someone that had gone through a flawless surgery
Who the hell is doing all of this?
l Saw  the old man
This one... and that one... All of these are his work.
Shinnou... sensei?
Yeah. I've heard of this guy
Hey you, do you know that old man?
You saw him?
Where at? Where the hell is he now?
Hey. dammit.
I swear? If anything bad's happened to him... Hurry and tell...
Hey! Who is this guy?
You've grown. Naruto
Does your pupil always cause you this kind of trouble?
Always...
Ah, old man this boy... uh...
Amaru
Hah, Amaru, and you're his sensei?
Out of gratitude, he'll call me sensei whether I want him to or not
Hen. figures
If you hadn't showed up and saved so many injured
Sakura-chan said she and the others would
have really had their hands full.
Amaru's village is on the outskirts of the fire country.
There's a hidden village in the vicinity
called "Navan" that true form is a temple that pierces the sky.
I've lived here since I first heard about it.
True...form...
Hah did you faint boy?
Eh?!
Hey. so you'll be leaving now that things have settled, right?
Heh! Shinnou-sensei just came to opened an office in this village.
We need some kind of place to sleep
Ah, I see
and that's why Medical-nin has to be on a 3-Man-Cell.
Eh?
Sakura-chan? Hinata? Eehh? 3-Man Cell?
Umm. with you along, makes our 3-Man-Cell
for yer sake, kiddo - it's why they're goin along..
Na -wait uh - hold uh hold up
Here
Huh?
It's a charm from Jiraira-sensei
Well then, its settled
Naruto-kun.
Heh?
let's work our best
What is she thinking?
Ninpo: Chouju Giga
[Ninja art: Super Beat Scrolls]
The enemy has arrived!
How many?
One
Hen, Konoha must be blind with emotion, to be expected
Still, let's can get fired up and take on this dog.
Right! First-waves - welcomes them, and play nicely..
Sir! Hurry men - make tums, then form an 8-fIyer-guard team
One... two... three...  four...
Can I do this? With only me I'll have to keep them from piling up on me.
In the sky you'll be on par to compete with those guys.
Take flight with a bird into their occupied territory.
But use your best (judgement and don't take any unnecessary risks
We want to see how they respond to our actions,
and (then turn away and come back.
Here I go...
They shouldn't give me much trouble if I can knock them into the ocean.
That should work    more or less
That was kinda quick...but I wonder if it was a little too much.
It's as Tsunade-sama said. They're making
repairs and didn't take much interest
I can't believe they would just Sit out in the open
like that. Hey. your calculations were dead on.
I knew their hiding place would be over there.
Since we could observe their chakra with Neji's Byakugan,
it was only(3 matter of time until a pilot's range could be determined.
Even then, it would have taken us four months to find them.
As expected from you, you saw through their plan.
As expected from you. you saw through their plan
that aside, with our Four-Man-Cell dispatched.
it's only natural that we'd finishes up, no sweat
At this point though, I think the only thing Konoha can do to oppose
these sky ninja is to prevent them from occupying any territory.
It should be a good plan. It should be a good plan.
Thank you for coming, Sasuke-kun.
What do you want?
We received intelligence this morning that Konoha was attacked.
We expect that it was completely destroyed
by the ninja from the sky country.
Why would you think D still have any interest in Konoha?
I don't care about Konoha anymore
I didn't call you to talk about that
Orochimaru-sama?
Sasuke-kun
there's a man there that I want you to bring to me
A man?
He's a doctor
That doctor
once gave me a valuable reincarnation jutsu.
But he and I are different
I expect his immortality jutsu is completely perfect.
so that's why you want him?
Bring him to me. I need that jutsu now.
Amaru's village is in this jungle further upstream
It's a hidden place with many historic ruins.
Yeah, but why do we have to take these boats down the river?
We'd be much faster on foot
In this "friendly" jungle there are poisonous insects,
poisonous snakes and other beasts!
Eah!!
here are more cannibalistic monsters in this river as well.
And I think I would stay away from the fish too.
Huh?
You're safe. In either of these boats and you
can go straight to the doctor riding with you.
And I brought this scalpel, just in case.
Hah! That's a laugh, a doctor protecting a Shinobi.
And just what can you save with that scalpel?
Are you going to cut someone down with it?
You're one to talk!
Even if you're skilled I'm Shinnou-sensei's'best student!
But you're just a ninja and don't have anything Dike that in your cold world!
Do you even known what it's like to have friendships and create bonds with people?
Why you! I can't let that go! I know lots of people...
Iruka-sensei, Kakashi-sensei, and even Ero-sennin.
They're a STRONG force! I understand what it's like
 to have strong bonds that can never be broke
oww!
What was that for. Sakura-chan?
Be quiet for a minute.
Huh?
There're wings made of chakra in the sky. A patrol pilot   It's
the same type that we saw dunng the assault on Konoha.
the same type that we saw dunng the assault on Konoha.
There're wings made of chakra in the sky. A patrol pilot. It's
the same type that we saw dunng the assault on Konoha.
They really are pests...
Get under cover, now!
Crap, this is bad!
Hey! What the hell!
They definitely passed us by . That was close.
Amaru? Amaru!
Hey! Amaru! Hang in there!
You're definitely,gonna make it!
Amaru, well done.
Shinnou-sama. It's my goal to become a ninja.
Amaru,
I've already abandonded the path of fighting.
There was once a need for fighting strength.
but the ability to save someone's life is much more valuable.
The strength to save someone's life?
And just as there is a sword that ends people.
there is also a sword that saves them.
Naruto!
Huh?
*& Idiot! i
Hey... by chance are you...
Naruto?
Poison!
Naruto! Hang on! Naruto!
Naruto? What were you doing to end up like this?
Err... about that... it's nothing.
The foreign substance spreads quickly,
a person with a blade can give care for anything.
If the wound has something in it the first thing is to squeeze it out.
And save the fallen Shinobi who have become friends.
They've grown
There, it's fine now.
This visitor managed to drain off the poison and
neutralize the rest with the perfect antidote.
Amazing! It's flawless!
Amaru
Well done.
Yes sensei
It worked out
I'm glad
don't worry,
the only beasts are bug catchers.
Just a little further to Amaru's village.
Hey umm, back there, you handled everything completely.
You were amazing.
No I'm not.
Shinnou-sensei is the amazing one.
But back there...
Uh a corsage
kinda womanly in the middle.
umm... hey you don't happen to be...?
EH? I knew it You're a girl!
Same difference, isn't it?
I'm just surprised is all
For that reason isn't it easier to go as a boy?
Uhh. Well... yeah.
I wonder of Shinnou-sensei could ever see the real me.
I get it.
you're in love with Shinnou o-chan
Idiot! That's not true!
Dammit. I can't move well ye.
Sorry
Look! Over there!
Huh? What's going on?
Amaru
Hey. calm down!
Wait!
No. it can't be
Anybody?
Where is everyone?!
Isn't anyone here?
Where did everyone run off to? Please come out!
A..mara "Are you Alright?
Sen..sei
What?
What happened here?
Sensei
Sensei hang in there
Sninnou sensei
How could I have been so
jumping in was all I could do
Why?
because...you are...my student
I'm leaving it up to you now
Work together with the others...to rescue the villagers
Sensei
#unrecognized text#
Sensei. Sensei
please, don't die
Why...
Sensei..
sensei Shinnou'saved my life
I was an orphan to start with
I was struggling from an unknown disease...no one wanted to help me
but sensei Shinnou wasn't scared of the spread and looked after me
When I woke up. Sensei Shinnou said to me with a smile
you did well
Umm...
We can't find any of the villagers bodies, which
probably means they evacuated somewhere
we should search for the villagers on our own.
alright C
I can't do well without you
I haven't... I haven't told you ...anything yet
not a thing
What is this chakra?
oh its just Naruto
Naruto
hey Sakura-chan
Weren't you with Hinata?
yea
anyway, what are you doing?
What about the search for the villagers?
Sakura-chan, look at that
what .is that!?
Maybe the ruins Shinnou was talking about
Amaru!
what .are you doing here?
I am Reibi
[Reibi- Zero tail (a tailed beast (bijou)]
in the age filled with war, and man-kinds hearts filled with darkness
I shall re-imerge (literal translation is I shall be revived)
What's she saying?
Amaru, what's wrong?
I devour darkness of the minds, form, and grow
to conquer this world with darkness
damn
where is he?
ninpou choujuugiga
One more to go
I can't buy anymore time
Sai is approaching his limit
Kakashi sensei, stay here
It's close to time. I will draw their attention
Finally, my part is over
I'll leave the rest to you
I hate to do work but
It can't be helped
alright then,
Planning on blinding me using the Sun as his background huh
They are well trained
But that's a mistake
ninpou, kage shibari no jutsu
Hits about time for the counter attack
rest is up to you, 4th of our 4 man formation
what is this...strange chakra
Sakura-chan?
you...!
You...
you got something very interesting
why don't you use that power?
That power you have.
I want it!
Sakura-chan.
perv-hermitt (ero-sennin)
This power that hurt everyone
I shouldn't use it
Show me your dark powers
the darkness within your heart
I will...rescue Amaru with my own strength
You know best
That you can't do it without that power
What?
His name is Sasuke?
you couldn't shine out the darkness in his heart
you can't rescue anyone
Thats it...
get-angry, more anger
There's nothing...you can do
Ero-sennin
thats right
I need to  do this., bring her back with my own powers
Amaru!
Amaru, wake up!
aren't you Shinnou's student?
a student should follow the master's teaching
Don't you want to be told you did well?
Shinnou sensei
not only Naruto but...I even lost Amaru's dark mind
It should be enough to activate it
If D drag the world into this war. it will be easy enough
to gather more darkness of the hearts
rise Ancolbuntium
Destroy the 5 countries and ressurect the country of sky
Amaru
are you ok?
you did well
you came back
Shinnou is probably saying the same
yea
Sakura-chan
Are you ok?
why ..why do you have to hit me
you were staring at me so close up
so. what happened?
I'm not really sure how to explain it but
case solved!
what's happening!?
what's sloved9 nothing is sloved at all!
Could Hinata and the missing villagers all be inside this thing?
Sakura-chan. take Amaru and go back to town now
I will rescue Hinata and the villagers
alright. I will be back ..with reinforcements
Amam-chan. lets go
what's wrong? get on my back
hurry. Amaru-chan
I don't want to?
I want to do what Shinnou sensei would have
I want to rescue them
but you staying won't make any difference
alright then
Come with me
hold on Naruto
yes!
We'll be-fine
I will protect Amaru
Hey!
oh well...he never listens
anyway, reporting back to town is first priority
what!?
The forest...
It's moving...
Naruto!
Whats the orders?
Should we alttack again?
There should be no need for it
hurry it up with the restocking!
understood
hurry it up with the restocking
We will gladly be your opponent
As a bonus to annihilating Konoha
Bits almost time
The enemies are almost done restocking
We are going to get hit hard
You shouldn't worry about that
Because...It's impossible...for me to fail
What's happening?
imp impossible!
in...insects!?
Oh well
hey Naruto
hmm?
We are ...nah, the whole ruins is flying
damn it, what's going on?
How many times am I going to be surprised today
You are my student
Sensei...
Amaru
Lets go
..Alright
As long as this was made by people, someone have to be controlling it
yea. we need to find the person and stop this ruin
and then save the villagers
Those guys are
Damn it
Orah!
Get out of the way!
Well done both of you
knew it! I knew it!!
I believed in you
I believed in you!
I knew you couldn't have died
I knew you wouldn't leave me be
Why?
How is this possible?
What is going on here?
hmm... Where can I start explaining to have you
 delinquents to understand what's going on
This flying ruins is called "Antourupantiamu"
it-looks like a ruin, but...
It was made by the soranins over couple of decades with their research
It is the ultimate weapon of destruction
Antourupantiamu?
It means "the stronghold of the King's capital"
hey old man
What are you doing inside their stronghold!?
After getting hit by so many,of their Kunai
It's easy enough to fool amature ninjas such
as Hinata and Sakura to make my death

jutsu?
Why are you talking so funny!?
What are you trying to accomplish here old man?
You're here to fight the sora-nins right!?
Why can't you figure it already?
Sensei...
Why should I fight with my own people?
Amaru!
14 years ago. in order to steal the jutsushiki of the Reibi
disguised myself as a traveling doctor
you...
you lied to Her all along!
13 years to find the jutsushiki to revive Reibi
I finally found it
In the Konoha village,
and the power of Reibi
The dark chakra
Dark Chakra!?
Wait Naruto!
He's not himself right now
So we should bring him back
Please!
To bad Amaru
I didn't go crazy and nothing is wrong with me
If there is something wrong, that would be me in the past
What are you doing Amaru?
Are you trying to imitate Shinnou-sama?
Even if you dress the same, your skills aren't
Amaru, it looks great on you
Thank you
When darkness forms in human heart.
Reibi's seeds can be implanted into them to materialize them.
It's easy to understand it once realised
It took 14 years though
Darkness  of the heart?
humans lose hope
When about to be taken over by sorrow.
the emotion that gets directed towards those who caused it.
Anger. Hatred
all of those emotions creates dark chakra
D made them attack your village, to implant Reibi into you
No way...lies, lies
Its all lies
right sensei?
Sensei!
Master?
Student?
What is this useless relationship?
You went with my plan and you were used
Your skill progressed Amaru
you've done well
Yes
A person that had their life saved never doubts their saviour
Amaru!
Hey Amaru!
ohh. I feel it
I feel it
Strong dark chakra
I won't forgive you for this
You I cannot forgive!
power of the dark chakra is not used only for reviving Reibi
Depending on how its used
Things like this can be done to!
This is the jutsu of nikutai kassei
by having this ultimate body? it is possible for the
 first time to open up all 8 gates up to the shimon
Shimon is death gate, he is referring to the opening of the
 chakra gates in which Rock Lee and Gai uses as well
Do you understand now?
what it means to have an ultimate body
ohh sorry
Its still hard to control this power!
Now i see
It was sized for the person with the ultimate body to sit on
Its truely a seat made for the king
I don't agree to this!
you...
the king?
I don't agree!
Amaru?
muscle...
by destroying and rebuilding gets strengthened
By knowing the mechanism of tissue reconstruction by medical-ninjutsu
and by destroying the body
It is possible to strengthen the body at any time
you...
Chakra release utilizing the ultimate body
and this is the ultimate shot
Chou-kassei-ken
[Super Speed Fist]
I so happy
You can still move after that hit?
but...
you dirtied my seat
and you'll pay for that
You think you you fooled me?
to bad
Now show me
The dark power that you possess
No way you are getting away with that!
Why do you hold back?
Reibi lets me know
You have powers sealed in you that can entertain me
I won't...
use it!
I want to test out
This power
The power of the dark chafers
you...
you...
If I don't punch you with my fist
I won't be satisfied
Naruto...
This is
no, this is it
The power you believe in, which can be obtained .from years of work
This is the limits of it
mankind are weak
do not possess any fangs nor claws
capable of only crying
but why were they able to make this world their own?
Its because.
out of all creatures..
humans are the most.
Creul!!!
Am I wrong?
desiring for higher grounds than other creatures
Mankind left animals behind
and evolved
That power that maid it happen.
Is definitely.
Not love!!!
You've gotta be kidding. Just because you got some strange jutsu.
Well I'm not paying around.
I don't feel like comparing the two,but...
My sensei, friends that are always there for me. Ero-sennin.
I Dove them. I loved them all. I can't take it anymore!
That's enough. Give me a break. I was wrong.
What was it I was trying to teach someone like you? Defending someone
to the death? Love? Heh. heh!
Listen to how things have changed. Amaru.
I'm going torment you without hesita (tion)
Shut up!
Naruto! I... I... my strength...
That doesn't hurt at all!
Naruto.
Let's go!
Chakra resuscitation sword
Kasseiken!
Naruto!
That's a nice expression, Amaru. Don't forget that hatred.
Never forgive me. Hahaha
Where there is a blade for .wounding people, there is
also a blade for saving people
Amaru. I...can still fight. All those things that make you sad,
that you regret, they don't matter. You can't hold yourself back
anymore. All the sadness, everything. I'll take it all in for you
You stay right there! Cause now I'm gonna kick your ass!
Naruto...I'm sorry...I'm sorry...   Sensei.
You're wrong. That's not what I meant You have to keep on living
That's, that's why you have to say good bye. You haven't said anything.
have you. You haven't said...how you feel. You've gotta tell
him right?
Yeah. It was the first time. I had been praised for doing something.
He praised me. For the first time, someone taught me what I should do.
I see
For the first time I thought, "am I pretty?". "I wonder what he
thinks of me?" Thoughts of sensei filled my head.
For the first time I wanted to be liked. I wanted him to like me.
Always...always. I've always loved you. sensei!
Hahahaha!
twisted way of thinking on people! People, the feeling of
loving someone, the very heart of that emotion, there's no
way they'd all just turn into darkness! Guys like you are just.
worthless filth!
Cha. my chakra is...huh?
never...forgive you. Rasengan!
Wha...Sasuke?! You!
Sorry to butt .in but Orochimaru wants to borrow your power.
My power? And if I refuse you'll take me away by force?
If that's what you wish.
You underestimate me. Thought my dark chakra had disappeared,
did you? How naive! I have enough darkness swirling in my
heart to make it rot! Using my kassei no jutsu...
[Resosusculation Technique]
Try it.I don't mind, so give it a try.
Hurry up and show me.
Sasuke, knock it off! The more you beat him up the stronger he gets!
Sensei...
What's wrong? Can't heal yourself?
Wha, what did you do?
I already cut off your flow of chakra.   It-appears as though
you didn't even notice my Chidori Senbon?
1000 Birds
You disrupted my chakra control? When did you.
I would not kill you. I'm taking you to Orochimaru.
I'm not what Orochimaru is after. He probably wants this.
The scroll I stole from Konoha
Hahaha? Don't .think you've won! This is far from over!
Sasuke!
Amaru. D have to go after him...Just.like you said. Amaru.
I may be able to save him. Giving up is easy. But that's all the more
reason  ou have to go help everyone from the village.
That's what he taught you about saving people, right?
Sasuke, wait? How long have you been here! Tell me!
What's wrong?
They followed me here so unknowingly, the idiots!
Who's the idiot!
What do you think? You cant even use Chidori can you. This place takes
the chakra the Reibi collected and absorbs it. turning it
into energy. All the chakra you've used up till now has been absorbed as
energy for the Ankol Vantian. You're powerless!
Quit your blabbering. Chakra has nothing to do with it!
I'll just beat you up with my fists then!
Whether or not our chakra is being absorbed makes no difference.
What a happy-go-lucky bunch you are
Did you honestly think I'd bring you all the way to the
center of the Vantian just to seal your chakra?
Did you honestly think I'd bring you all the way to the
center of the Vantian just to seal your chakra?
Ahaha! Did you truly believe the Ankol Vantian was just a flying fortress?
Bijou just for that? Within this fortress is a weapon
powerful enough to destroy the 5 Great Ninja Countries in an instant!
What did you say!
Watch!
Wha. What was that just now?
Did you see it!? The power of the Sky Country! After I've destroyed the
5 Ninja Countries, the brotherhood of the Sky Empire will rule all!
Don't screw with me! Like I'd let you get away with it!
Fools!
Sasuke!
Hehehe! I'll start with you. Sasuke.
Damn you! Let Sasuke go!
Everyone! Are you all okay...eh!  Wha, what is this?
Wha. What happened. Hold on. I'll save you!
You mustn't touch it. This dungeon absorbs chakra.
Hinata-san?
Amaru-chan. at this rate the village people will.
See if you cant do something about the lock
Over there.
Sensei...
Sensei. I'll do my best.
What's wrong? Gan't do anything without, our chakra?
Shitfaced kids!
Hehe. Look who's talking. You can't even fight against some
shitfaced kids without transforming into a monster! Don't fact so tough!
shut will know the full power of the Sky Emperor1
How unsightly   Someone who doesn't even
take time to measure his own strength
calling himself the Sky Emperor. It's so pitiful it's humorous.
What are you trying to do?
Surely you don't want to hasten your own death?
So that's what you're planning. I understand, Sasuke.
If you really want chakra so much. I'll give you all that you can handle!
Impossible! A mass of chakra so big the Reibi can't .absorb it!
Tajuu Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!
Not yet! Alight!
Like I'd let you!
Die! Die!!
What!?
Tatsumaki Rasengan!
[Tornado Rasengan]
I see. So that's your little trick.
It's over.
Go!
You're no protector of lives, damn it
To think that you'd get this far. However, I can't die like this!
What?!
It seems you figured it out. But to think that you managed
to sever the Reibi's attachment... I should have expected as much
from the last surviving Uchiha. And the Kuubi Jiichuuriki
But in the end you two are nothing more
than clueless brats!
What did you say
Even I don't know what will happen if the Reibi is let loose!
Wait, Sasuke! Where are you going!
What's happening. Wait! Stop!
Hurry! Everyone get on! How do we make this thing fly?
Over there! Underneath that face, right in the middle
Hurry up and get on. Amaru. Hinata, I need to pull this, right?
Naruto-kun!
Naruto...se, sensei...
Amaru, get on
What are you going to do? You can't fly
There's still something left for me to do.
You go with everyone from the village.
No! I'm staying here!
You can't!
I said I'd stay so I'm staying! How many times do I have to tell...ah!
Sasuke-kun!
Annoying.
Naruto!
Alright! Thank you. Sasuke
Get a grip You've gotta stop that guy
Do you know why shinobi have students? We do it to have them inherit
our Nindou. Your jutsu still has a long
Nindou means way of the ninja
way to go. but you have the guts to never give up. Your Nindou is the
spitting image of mine.
Ero-sennin
Guts...Guts...Guts!
Let's go everyone! Yeah!
Dokonjou Rasengan!. go!
[Guts Rasengan!]
Lets GO!
He never stops does he
He is an idiot, after all
It coming this way.
We should get out of the way. shouldn't we.
Yeah.
Guts!
What's this?
Can you see it. Neji?
Heh. This isn't something you need byakugan to see.
Yeah.
How's that for guts. Ero-sennin?
Rasengan!
Naruto-kun!
Amaru-chan!
Naruto! Naruto. I won't let you be alone.
Naruto   I won't let you be alone
