ah!
buddy.
Ah!  Ugh!
Ah ah ah.
Ugh.  Ugh.
This is because I stuck
my finger in you, isn't it?
Oh, come on, baby,
don't be like that.
Well, when are
we gonna get together?
When are we gonna meet up?
No, no, tomorrow.
It's just my ear.
It hurts a little bit.
I got you,
you little son--
oh!
Phew.
Fuck you!
And now,
Introducing that army charmer,
that navy-baby,
The marine-queen,
the lady who's middle name
is 'ka-boom'!
whoo-hoo.
Yoo-hoo.
Huh?
Frau scheisse?
Rowr.
Bertie.
Bertie.
Keep calm, my son...
And carry on.
- Never surrender!
Fight!
ow!
hmm?
Huh?
Ooh!
Oh!
Mmm!
Ooh la la!
- Ooh!
- Oh!
♪ why can't
we be like this ♪
♪ every day?
- ♪ I'll make you
-  ♪ so proud of me...
♪ we could be...
♪ so perfect
♪ you will see
♪ you will- will...
- ♪ you will...
Oh.
Ahh...
Ah!
god damn it.
None of this
is working.
This is
a fucking
disaster.
Ok, that was good.
Ah, could you give me
one more of those?
Just like less high pitched
and more just like terrified
And kind of make it
a little longer too,
if you could.
Okay.
It's not my fault
we got the letter 'q.'
- That's you being disrespected.
- I know.
Did you see
the press release?
I was last!
Yeah, I saw that.
You were even after
nacho vigalondo.
Besides... 5 grand?
How do they expect us
To make any kind of movie
for five thousand dollars?
alright.  So what
are we going to do
To make
our segment stand out?
What if our
"a.B.C.S of death" short
Is the only segment
in the entire film
To feature an actual
on-screen death,
Like, like somebody
actually dies?
Actually,
that's a great idea.
Like we kill an animal
or something?
Yeah, it wouldn't have
to be a person.
We could kill an animal.
Nobody gives a shit
about animals.
But what animal
could we kill?
- It's gotta start
with a 'q'...
- A 'q'.
...Or something to do
with a 'q.'
A fucking 'q'.
Actually,
he's kind of cute.
- Yeah, he is.
- Hey, mr. Quackers,
come here.
yes, yes...
ahhh, fuck!
Let's kill
this fucking duck.
Juan, you might wanna
back up just a little bit.
Alright.
Ok, so how do
we wanna do this?
Well, we gotta
make sure we pretty much
kill it right away.
- We don't want it
to suffer too much.
- Right, right, right,
Yeah, yeah. This isn't
a snuff film, this is art.
Ducks die
all the time for food.
Ok... Yeah, yeah.
This is what you eat, america!
You american pigs!
They're the real killers,
not us.
That's right, yeah.
Hey, juan,
We're gonna just
tail-slate this.
Is that cool?
Alright...
So on the count of three?
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- Alright.
One...
Two...
Thrrr...
Hold on a second.
Can you just shoot the duck?
I mean I--
I know it's my,
umm, you know, thing...
But uhhh if you
would shoot the duck,
I'd appreciate it.
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
Ok... One...
Two...
This fucking thing,
goddamnit.
- You got the safety on?
- You know, I don't even know
what side it's on.
Yeah, it's that thing
sticking out the side
right there.
Oh, oh shit!
Ugh.
Let go of me,
you crazy assed bitch!
What you're trying to do,
can't be done.
Hell's coming down on you.
I'm just along for
the ride, baby.
- Want me to shoot you?
- You can't kill me.
Lucky!
Yeah, woo-fucking-hoo,
it's my lucky day,
you fucking psycho!
Enjoy the ride, bitch!
Fuck you!  Motherfucker!
you'll never outrun him,
you crazy junkie bitch!
- Shut up, bitch!
- Fuck you!
- You fucking whore!
Close your eyes...
fuck.
for the first time
in a long time
- I'm impressed.
- Good.  Now leave me alone.
Take her.
She's given up
and you know it.
You cunt!
Huh, na...
It's not her time!
Please...
Leave me alone.
There's still
so much I wanna do.
You gave me a run
for my money.
Nobody's ever made me
chase them that
hard before,
But you can't run forever.
Fuck!
- It's showtime!
- I can't understand
Why he's so afraid
of the toilet.
well, for young boys
the most common cause
Of genital injury is when
the toilet seat falls down.
He's not gonna
have that problem
if he's going for a poo.
Loads of people
have died on the toilet.
- Like who?
- Elvis.
- He died on the bathroom floor.
- Yeah!  Died on the toilet
and then fell over.
If I were him, I'd be more
scared of those screws I put in.
They're the wrong size.
Honey,
you go do a poo poo.
There's nothing
to be afraid of.
Danny glover had nothing to be
afraid of in "lethal weapon 2."
- Shhh!
- We might even have
A lethal weapon
of his own in a moment.
Uh...
Whoa!
- Bleeding hell fire.
That's odd.
- Shh shh.
That's really odd.
Look at the state--
Whoa!
What on earth?
Call the plumber now.
It's an emergency.
What?
Help!
Oh!  You fucking bastard!
Huh?
Hey!  Hey!  Wake up.
He's finally
using the toilet...
About fucking time.
Stand back!
he's spitting.
He's spitting!  Hold him!
Get in!
- E nomine patris...
I've got hold of it...
don't!  Nooooo!
Ah!
Be careful, man!
- He's in here,
I heard something!
I can hear it breathing!
Come on, let's go!
wake up!  Wake up!
I'll make you one promise--
Your children will
never know how this ended.
See?
Father...
Finish it!
Geoff...
The world is dying.
It's one of the reasons
We implemented
the infant sterilization act.
Still, every citizen
has the right
To earn back
their fertility permits.
The fastest route
has always been
Through service
to propagation control.
Oh yes, sir,
it's why I joined--
That and making the world
a safer place, of course.
Of course.
Why do you want children?
Propagation control...
You are charged
with acts of terror
through illegal propagation.
You are hereby ordered
to surrender all contraband.
Please, you don't know
what they'll do to him.
- It's not up to me.
- I'm sorry,
There's been
a misunderstanding.
You've already verified
our permits.
A misunderstanding...
The illegals have escaped.
We're free to go.
...Free to go...
No!
Bad, nezbit, bad!
Calm down, officer.
Your nezbit unit simply
auto-responded
To para-psychic activity.
Commander stoker...
Congratulations,
You've dispatched
a rather dangerous group
of mentals.
- Mentals?
- Telekinesis, telepathy,
Mind control--
all very real...
- All valuable
genetic materials.
"materials"?
We just killed a child.
oh, it wasn't alive
to begin with.  Not by law.
Hmm.  The rebels were
delivering the child
To the vatic,
"prophet" of all mentals.
With such power,
his very existence
threatens humanity,
But, once we've reanimated
And bio-vac'd every
last bit of brain matter,
We may finally
ascertain his location.
A fine achievement,
officer.
You see, the agency has
a far greater purpose
than its...
"public position."
You've given
ten years of service
to your unit, officer.
Your records are
excellent.
I'm pleased
to say that your permits
have been approved.
Sir...
- Yes, sir.  Uh...
- I'm not finished...
While your permits
are approved,
There are biological factors
beyond the agency's control.
Reanimate the infant.
I can't let you do this.
- Nezbit, officer lainey has
clearly been compromised.
Arrest her.
I won't let you
re-murder a child.
Oh, grow up!
Better a cruel truth than
a comfortable delusion.
Sir...
Sir, the baby is...
Where'd he go?
Sir?  Did you hear that?
It's a mental, idiot!
Shoot for the head!
Oh, shit...
Oh, such vitality... Mmm!
I'll keep the corpse
alive for weeks...
Wasn't taking him
to the prophet.
Farm every burning neuron...
He is the prophet.
Feast on his pain.
- Take him...
- Unite the mentals...
- Oh!
- You're his mother now.
scream, witch.
- No-one will hear you as
I harvest your intestines.
What?
Unhand her, witch!
- Willowford!
- Wendy!
- Save me!
- Now, warlock!
- What the fuck?
- What's up, tommy?
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Look, the thing's almost done.
- What is that!?
- Well, um, it's for animated--
It's the last frame
of the animation I've been
working on, remember?
- Animation?
- Yeah.
We weren't even supposed
to have animation.
Well, I thought we talked
about a bunch of different
ideas, remember?
Look at this list of,
err, 'w's I got here.
Oh my god, what the
fuck is wrong with you?
We're gonna get this
done. Hold on, it's a--
- Why do you do this?
- Here's the thing, walrus,
It's like a godzilla-walrus.
It's a city--
people are being destroyed,
you pan over, it's a walrus.
'w.'
- Ok, do you have a city?
- No.
- Do you have a guy
in a walrus
outfit? - No.
- Can you do
that by this
weekend? - No.
well, what the fuck are
you talking about then?
- Warrior.
- Super hot chick.
She's just killed a bunch of,
like... Trolls?
Alright, whatever,
she's covered in blood.
Ok.  Let's do that.
Lets do that this weekend.
I'm not sure that
I want to do that one.
I'm just saying it's an idea...
W' is
for wheelchair.
It's an old man.
An evil old man.
He's in the wheelchair--
everybody hates old people.
- He gets pushed off
a fucking cliff.
I got it-- ummm...
I got-- I got nothing.
You guys!  You gotta
come to the conference room.
Come on, you gotta see this!
Nancy, I'm coming to you
from downtown hollywood,
And I've got to tell you,
some of the strangest things
I have ever seen...
- Oh fuck, what's going on?
- ...Are going on right now.
If you can see,
over my head,
The most oddest looking
colored gases.
Uh, they're like chemtrails,
I guess,
And they seem to be followed
by other planes and copters,
and a general sense...
- 'w'!
- ...Of panic seems
to have hit the area.
Believe it or not, nancy,
we're actually getting reports
Of people seeing
clown zombies in the streets.
Fuckin' clown zombies?
That's fucking stupid!
What are they looking for?
Magnets?  'w'?  I just...
Is that a 'w' on there?
What's up with these 'w's?
Is this some kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy,
As we watch the horror
Of our own minds
Pushing humanity
toward extinction?
Can we live in a world
That is more immoral
than our own brains,
- Our own ideas...
- No!  Don't open the door!
We live in a process
that is already infested,
Already mutated,
already over!
Already blank...
...From a wave
of congealed confidence!
my elbows are untouchable!!
My elbows are sharp!!
I am transparent.
I am solid in the form
of this new liberty reborn!
You are invisible
in this new world!
I hover above you...
Above as below.
I am legion.
A traced mindfuck
of a billion bombs
Dropping on your
fired synapses,
Your tired synapses!
You are inserted,
digested, gestated!
Lie in the waste
of your own vision,
Gutter punks to bigger words
that you ate years ago!
That you tasted
and shat upon years ago!
That you chewed
and corrupted after the seeds
were buried long ago!
I am the one
with seven heads!
I am the thing that laughs!
I am the thing
that waits... For you!
What the fuck?

For the first time
in a long time
- I'm impressed.
 Good.
Now leave me alone.
Take her.
She's given up
and you know it.
You cunt!
I can't
let you do this.
Nezbit, officer lainey has
clearly been compromised.
- Arrest her.
 I won't let you
re-murder a child.
Oh, grow up!
Better a cruel truth than

Sir...
Sir, the baby is...
Where'd he go?
Sir?  Did you hear that?
Such vitality... Mmm!
I'll keep the corpse
alive for weeks...
Scream, witch.
- No-one will hear you as
I harvest your intestines.
- What?
- Unhand her, witch!
- Willowford!
- Wendy!
- Save me!
- Now, warlock!
Me, with my cereal
I can manage
my summer slimness.
Slimness, flat tummy...
- Get ready for the summer!
With low dye...
Say no to fat!
- Rich in vitamins...
My body loves it,
as you can see!
It's a gift
from our beloved,
-  Nice country america.
