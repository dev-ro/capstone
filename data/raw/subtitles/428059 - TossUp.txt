Ridvan! There are mines over there.
Ridvan, Ridvan!
Ma! I am cold girl,
pour some water.
"Veteran's Food Stand"
Hamit, you're taking the fridge
to the back, right?
You're blocking the way,
sitting there like that!
If you mind your step,
there should be no problem.
See, is 35 degrees, and still
he's wandering around in a suit.
Your blood pressure's 22, sugar 180,
but you're drinking raki in the sun.
You should take care!
Come on son, we are just
sharing a small bottle.
We are celebrating the opening.
Opening day is tomorrow!
- Don't make a fuss.
By the way brother, this is
the hottest August I can remember!
This humidity is killing me.
Did you hit your hand?
Let uncle Maki do it, if you want, eh?
Dad, stay at my uncle's
tonight, too.
My girlfrienïs visiting me
this evening.
Well, I won't be sleeping in your
bed. You two can stay in your room.
Dad, you have been staying
at uncle's for a week.
Just stay one more night?
Is only 45 minutes by train.
And tomorrow you will be here
for the opening. Stay at my uncle's.
I said I am busy tonight!
Well, I bet you'll have no problem
putting me in a home
when I'm past it either.
You little piece of shit!
Muhittin says he's
two thousand dollars short.
He'll send the rest next week.
Thas what he said eh?
- Thas right.
And where is he now?
- At his shop.
Hold on, what was the agreement?
You know the opening is tomorrow.
Where am I meant to get
two thousand dollars from?
We've got bills too.
Watch your mouth!
Hey! OK, hang up now.
Hey Cevher, are you OK man?
I get nervous in crowds.
Come on, les go home.
Get some rest.
Hello? Who? Oh, he is not
free right now. He is in the toilet.
Yes.
Muhittin. - Eh?
Muhittin.
Hello. Look, I'm coming over now.
You get my two thousand ready, OK?
What? OK, I'm hanging up
and coming there now.
He says to come over and talk.
Bastard.
Forget it man.
OK, you are right.
We'll get the money somehow.
What about Zeyyat?
He's already paid half of it.
You don't know nothing.
Where is Muhittin?
- Inside. He's busy. Sit down.
Don't make me mad.
I'm just gonna talk to him!
Hey, calm down.
I'll call you later man.
Give me the money.
What did I tell you man?
I told you I'd pay it tomorrow.
You said next week,
don't screw around!
And now I say tomorrow.
I couldn't get my check either.
I said today!
Don't be late tonight.
Hi there.
- Hi.
Ridvan, the war hero.
Come on, les have some tea.
Thanks, thank you.
Welcome back Ridvan.
- Thanks.
How's things?
Fine.
How's your dad?
He's fine.
How's your mom?
Fine too.
You're covered in flour.
We were making pastry.
You didn't come to
meet me at the station.
I was embarrassed, I guess.
How do I look?
You're fine.
Just like you used to.
How?
You look like you have both legs.
You looked awful when you didn't
have the false leg, of course.
Really?
- Really.
You didn't say so, then.
How could I?
You can wear other shoes
on it too, right?
Right.
Shall I go to your dad on Sunday
and ask if I can marry you?
Let me ask him.
- Ask him what?
You said we'd go after
I got the leg? - We did.
So?
OK then. I'd better leave now.
I'm so sorry.
- Thanks dear.
Don't be sad Rahime.
He is a hero now.
I hope to God
it never happens to you.
He'll go straight to heaven.
But of course she's sad.
Her only son.
For God and Country, I said.
He went to serve his country.
Who could have known?
Well, thank God he's still alive.
But Ridvan loved football so much.
He just wants to play again,
but without his leg...
I said, "What can we do?"
Thank God you're still
alive and by my side.
God save us all.
I wouldn't wish this
on my worst enemy.
Hello guys.
- Hi Ridvan, welcome.
Thank you.
Hello.
- Hi.
How are you Ridvan?
- I'm fine.
You haven't been around?
- Had a change of climate.
Ridvan, make some room.
How are you Ridvan? - Fine.
- A glass of tea for Ridvan too.
No, I want some water.
- Give us a deck.
Ridvan, where was your
initial training?
Manisa.
Fazil is off the army.
You remember him?
Hey, aren't you Hayati's nephew?
Thas right.
Where are you gonna do
your training? - Burdur.
Look buddy, just play
dumb in the army, OK?
How do you mean?
I mean don't be a smart-ass.
What else can I say?
Tell me Ridvan, how on earth
did you step on that mine?
Never mind.
Yesterday evening we were
playing billiards,
and some assholes were
talking behind your back.
I wanted to beat the shit...
- Never mind those bastards.
What were they saying?
They say you shot at some mules,
thinking it was the PKK,
and you stood on the mine
while clearing the field.
Those fags are telling
all sorts of tales.
Whoever's talking this kind of shit,
stand up like a man.
Come on.
I fought for you, I fought for you.
I lost this leg for you.
I shit on your faces.
I shit on all your faces.
I shit on the face of whoever
talking behind my back.
What the hell is he talking about?
He's talking about
someone else, not you.
Why've you parked the tractor
in front of the shop?
There is a delivery coming.
- OK, I'm taking it away.
Hey Ridvan. You're early.
Hey, that leg looks real.
Throw away that stick, man.
No, I can't step on it yet,
it hurts. I'm cold, man.
Come on in, Firuz is here.
- Thank you.
How are you Mustafa?
Fine. How are you feeling?
- Fine, thanks.
How are you feeling Ridvan?
Fine. Thanks.
Don't you know Firuz? He used
to be a potter at Avanos.
He had a shop called "Earth".
Right, at...
By the Kizilirmak river.
I used to work with
Devran from Bingol.
Devran from Bingol?
- Right.
Their stall was the best.
Devran's daughter was my classmate
at high school.
Really? I knew Elif
when she was a child.
Ridvan, have some sausage.
No, I don't want any.
Her father took her to Bingol.
What else could he do?
His parents were old, his village
was evacuated. So he went there.
My so-called fiancee asked me,
if these were the only shoes
I could wear with this leg.
You know, like the wedding guests
will be staring at the cripple's foot.
Sencer, pour me
another glass of raki.
Don't mix that shit.
Don't worry I'm fine.
- Well, I'm off now.
Really?
- Yeah, my wife's waiting.
Are you leaving Firuz?
- Yeah.
Won't you shake my hand?
She used to be my girl
at high school, you know?
Elif, Elif.
Come here. Sit down
for a few minutes.
I'm gonna tell you something.
Come on.
One day she told me that she was
leaving. I asked where.
She said she was
going to her village.
What village?
Are you nuts, girl?
She said to Bingol.
We are Kurdish, you know.
I said, so what?
The villages are being evacuated.
There is terrorists.
Is what my dad wants.
My grandparents are ill.
I am going to them.
I said, what about me?
What about me?
Hearing that,
she took out a photo,
she'd been keeping it under her bra,
a photo of us in
the high school yard.
She said, I'm gonna
keep this till I die.
Do you understand?
If your friend, Devran from Bingol,
didn't go to his village,
I wouldn't have lost my leg.
Fuck Devran. Fuck his mother,
his whole family.
Hey! Don't swear like that.
I'll swear at anyone I want!
Ridvan, you lose your head
when you mix that shit.
You're really pissing me off.
What do you know?
Know what?
So, I'm cursing at your mate.
Got a problem!
Ridvan look.
You might have lost your leg,
but don't lose your dignity, OK?
Don't worry, I never will.
Thas enough Ridvan.
Just listen to yourself!
I lost my leg
in the name of dignity.
Good night.
Where are you going?
Home.
Sencer.
I didn't embarrass you, did I?
You swear at other
people's families.
Sencer.
Look. Forgive me if I upset you.
I'm not a normal guy
like the others. I'm a cripple.
You understand me, right?
You must forgive me.
You are no different
from the others.
Come, take me to Sefika's.
Forget Sefika now.
She asks me if these were
the only shoes I could wear.
I'll wear patent leather shoes.
Shiny shoes. I'll look like a fag.
Like a fag?
Yeah.
- Yeah?
I'm gonna play football with
this leg too. Hit the ball with...
What were you trying to
say to Sefika?
Rasit is coming.
What were you trying to say?
Hello father-in-law.
Hi.
Whas this mess?
There was a hole. I fell into it.
We were just laughing at that.
You made me a promise. Remember?
What was it?
I didn't drink much father-in-law.
Yes Rahime?
- Hello. - Hi.
Isn't Ridvan here?
No, he didn't come
here today at all.
What were you trying to tell her?
What were you trying to tell?
I'm asking you man.
- I told her to stay quiet.
Quiet is like this. Not like that.
You were saying I was stoned,
right? Right?
Fuck you. Fuck you man.
Don't laugh at me.
Fuck you. Fuck you.
Ridvan, don't drink that
shit too much.
Don't lose your dignity.
Am I supposed to take
dignity lessons from you?
Don't be a maniac, man.
- You are the maniac.
Am I supposed to take
dignity lessons from you?
Are you pulling a gun on me?
Take dignity lessons from you?
Take dignity lessons from you, eh?
Fuck off. Fuck off. Fuck you all.
You are all assholes.
My dear son.
Change that channel ma.
Do it yourself.
What are you thinking, girl?
What is she supposed to think?
Is obvious.
I won't let my daughter
marry a cripple.
You shut up. I didn't ask you.
I asked her.
So, what do you say, my daughter?
How are you Sehime?
- I'm OK Rahime. How are you?
I've come for shopping.
- The marriage is off Rahime.
Cause he is a cripple?
- Her dad wants it that way.
Forgive me. What can I say?
You were pulling a gun on me.
Are you crazy? I swear
I was gonna fire into the air.
You are my friend man,
how could I shoot you?
I'm here to apologize.
I'm wasting away Sencer.
My brain is wasting away.
Thas what drinks and drugs do.
No, thas not it.
- What is it, then?
I hear voices.
If I took that many drugs,
so would I.
Come, les talk inside.
No, I won't.
Just lend me some money.
I'm gonna run away
with that girl.
Don't do that man.
I'll pay you back
with my war pension.
You can't just run away together
in this day and age!
Well why not?
Her parents won't let her marry me.
They lock her in like an animal.
Those bastards.
So, are you gonna
lend me some money?
I can't. I had some,
but I invested in lemons.
I'm scared Sencer.
There are ghosts in these houses.
Bullshit.
Ridvan.
Ma.
Ma.
Ma.
Ma.
Ma, they are coming for me ma.
Sleep by my side.
No they aren't, son.
- No, they are.
They aren't.
- They are, ma.
They are, ma.
Ridvan, get up son.
Eat your food.
I don't want to ma.
My dear, eat some and
go back to sleep.
Don't stand there ma.
I don't want to eat.
Hello? Hello?
Hello?
Sefika, is me.
Ridvan.
Just wanted to ask how you are.
- I'm fine.
Is my parents, I swear.
They don't want it.
Tell me, do you want to marry me?
Say yes, and I'll take you away.
You are on the phone all day long...
I'm gonna tell your dad to
have the line cut off.
I wish you were never born.
You give me nothing but trouble.
My mother's shouting at me.
Forget me Ridvan.
I can't do that.
I don't want to get married.
Let me have five thousand dollars.
No man. You lend dollars,
you get dollars.
No one loses that way, right?
Right. Les meet at the
bar then. Have a drink together.
OK, OK. See you.
What would you like
to eat tonight son?
Don't wait up. I'll have a few
drinks and come home late.
No later than nine or ten.
OK, ma.
We can watch TV.
Hello.
- Hi.
Hello there, hello there.
Firuz. Come have some raki.
No thanks,
I'm waiting for some friends.
Firuz.
Don't be touchy with me.
You are older than me.
I am a cripple.
My brain is crippled too.
I'm sorry.
Nothing to be sorry about.
Bring another glass.
Come, let me buy you a raki.
Alright then.
I thought Sencer was coming too.
- I'm sure he will.
I'll be at your door at eleven thirty.
Do you hear? OK?
No, no. I've arranged everything.
Don't panic girl.
Thanks for the fatherly advice Firuz.
Cheers. - Cheers.
Enjoy your meals.
Where have you been, man?
Well, it takes a while getting here.
How are you? OK?
Yeah, I'm OK.
Why are you so moody?
Pour just a little, Ridvan.
Drink, drink.
- Thas enough. No more.
You are my guests.
I'm gonna quit drinking
after tonight.
Really. Or they won't let
me marry this girl.
So I said,
"All done, captain, sir!"
I'll get this.
No, you're my guests.
- Wait. Hold on.
OK. Just pay for your self then.
Look, I'll get it.
Les have a bit more to drink.
Look, les drink as friends.
Another small bottle, please.
Come on Firuz. Les go.
- Hold on a minute.
I'm not in a rush, but...
Look Firuz, I'm gonna
tell you something else.
If is another crappy army tale,
I don't want to hear about it.
Listen to me Firuz.
- Les go.
Stay a bit longer.
Have another drink.
Sit, sit.
Firuz, I never told this to anyone.
Not even to my ma or this pal here.
I'm gonna tell it to you,
because you can understand it
better than anyone else.
Then you will see
why I'm in this state.
They got us into a truck, man.
And we left the outpost.
Firuz.
- Hush.
I was singing.
I was scared shitless.
It was dark.
Pitch black.
Our headlights were off too,
just driving like that.
The soldier behind the wheel
was trembling.
There was another one called
Cevher the Ghost.
He was from Istanbul.
My buddy.
He was an excellent sniper.
Anyway, five minutes
had barely passed
when we heard a bomb explosion.
The Commander said it was bazooka.
He was a perfect commando.
Quite the soldier.
We got back to find
the base blown to bits.
The place was
teeming with terrorists.
About twenty or thirty of them.
They were good shooters too.
You wouldn't stand a chance.
It was a merciless war.
You could be gone in a second.
They killed our comrades.
So we started shooting them down.
Shooting them in the head.
We gunned down
about a dozen of them.
It lasted about an hour.
And then there was a
complete silence.
We gathered together and
realized we were all fine.
Have a good night.
- You too.
Ma, get up or you'll fall asleep
here. Go sleep in your room.
Just put a blanket over me.
Go away. Don't be rude.
You are the rude one.
It was almost dawn now.
We were all sitting together.
We couldn't move because
of the mines. I saw a movement.
I thought it might be a wolf,
when I saw this terrorist, a girl,
shot in the leg, crawling away.
I told her to freeze.
Then she turned her
machine gun on me.
I ducked when she started firing.
I looked up to see her
running away.
Even with her wound,
she was running like a goat.
Then she stumbled.
I told her to put her hands
up and get up.
She tried to use her machine gun.
Then I gunned her.
Her head, her back...
Then it was morning.
Ridvan, come here.
What is it
- Isn't that you?
Where did you find that, man?
- On the girl that you shot.
Where?
That one lying there.
Elif,
Elif.
What is he doing?
Ridvan! There are mines over there.
Ridvan, Ridvan!
Sencer. - Yes?
Maybe we should take
him to his house.
Don't worry.
He can take care of himself.
He sounds off his head.
- He is.
He says that he shot Elif.
As far as I know, Elif is still alive.
Really? - Yeah.
- I'm telling you, man. He's lying.
He wants to become a legend.
He drinks too much.
He's turned psycho now.
Well, there is some truth
to his words.
Appearantly Devran did become
a terrorist there.
They interrogated me because
we used to be business partners.
Well, he is a good liar.
He mixes in a bit of truth.
If I wasn't there,
he'd have asked for money.
Really?
- Yeah. He is that kind of guy.
I'm off to Ankara for a week.
- Why?
To sort some stuff out.
Shall I put this here?
No I'll take it.
Hello, Sencer?
Hello, Sencer?
Where are you going girl?
Our daughter's running away.
Tell the police! Damn you girl.
Ridvan!
