IRON MONKEY
You have to admit...
the governor's plan
is ingenious.
As long as he hoards
state food supplies...
Right, all these
refugees will work for crumbs.
And when he finally sells
that food...
he'll make a fortune!
GOVERNOR'S COURTHOUSE CHEKLANG
The Shaolin monks
are this way.
They won't be able to resist
our dim-sum.
Honored visitors,
we've made you a midnight snack.
ChiefFox,
if you cared less about food...
and more about security,
you wouldn't need our help.
Just a taste.
It's so delicious.
We have no time for dim-sum!
Until we arrest
the Iron Monkey...
keep your men
out of the way!
Those Shaolin monks
are so severe!
l should smack them,
but I’d rather have a snack.
l can't breathe.
Whose foot is in my face?
Hey, get back in here!
lf the Iron Monkey sees you,
he'll find my treasure...
and steal it!
I just love the feel of gold.
You can bathe in it
after the Iron Monkey's caught.
Quick, someone's coming.
Governor, sir.
It’s just me, sir.
I’ve brought you
some shark-fin soup.
Can't you see I’m busy?
Keep our soup warm...
and don't eat any!
Taste even a drop,
and you will pay!
-l wouldn't dare, sir.
-There--on the roof!
To the east!
Not even a bird
can escape my new trap.
The Iron Monkey doesn't
stand a chance against us.
Are you sure about that?
Let's go.
Men! Over here!
I’ve got him.
Masters, it's us.
Out of our way, buffoons!
He wants to trick us.
Hold your positions.
Ai!
Uhh!
-Hyah!
-Uhh!
Hyah!
Aah!
I’m going to teach you a lesson.
You can't best the righteous!
You're righteous?
How can it be righteous...
to defend a corrupt official?
He's in my house!
You're my favorite. You can
help me protect my jewels!
-Protect them yourself.
-Come back, my love.
Officer Cheng,
unleash the trap!
You're not so smart.
l finally got you!
Uhh!
Uhh!
Lower the net.
You were not harmed, sir?
You said my new trap
couldn't fail!
Go find him!
-Check the roof.
-Yes, sir.
Shaolin punks.
Be careful up there!
This post cost me a fortune.
I’m not giving up the rewards.
Your Excellency,
I’m pleased to confirm...
the Iron Monkey will go home
empty-handed tonight.
What's this?
My shark-fin! l warned you!
Your salary is docked.
In the fighting,
soup hit my face.
Sir, the Iron Monkey
has vanished.
Since you can't capture
a common criminal...
all of your salaries
are forfeited to me.
I’m surrounded by imbeciles!
Hey, which team
do you belong to?
Don't blink,
or you'll miss the fun.
He's back!
Thanks for the donation,
your Excellency.
You...
''The refugees certainly
appreciate your help.
''Give them some of the food...
you've stored at the warehouse,
or you'll see more of me!''
They've raised the reward
for the Iron Monkey.
Again?
Chief Fox,
we appreciate your offer...
to introduce us
to the governor.
This could be profitable
for all of us.
Starting today,
a tribute for His Excellency.
With his consent,
our brothel will be a gold mine.
We've got fallen monks
to handle security...
and desperate refugee girls
for entertainment.
A little something for you.
His Excellency is in a bad mood.
l must approach him carefully.
Keep it. lf it's stolen,
l can't afford to replace it.
-Is it the Iron--
-Shh!
That name is bad luck.
He cost my men their salaries.
We can't even afford
medical fees...
so your donation
is a big help to us.
Come and thank Mr. Chan.
Thank you.
-Scratchy throat?
-Yes.
-Diarrhea?
-Yes! And I’m very tired.
All right,
just give me your hand.
What do l suffer from?
You're oversexed,
and your kidney is weak.
You eat too much shark-fin.
This food makes you horny.
You are too weak
for such rich food.
But shark-fin
is so delicious.
Honestly, I’m not that weak!
You will need medicine.
Your fee will be 100 taels.
1 00 taels?
l don't have that much, doctor.
Don't worry, sir.
l won't charge you anything.
Thank you.
That's outrageous! My medicine
should be free, too.
You're a rich man.
Your medicine is expensive.
lf you can't afford it, l can
give you cheaper medicine.
l can afford it. Pay him.
He loves to take his medicine.
Thank you.
-Doctor.
-You look well.
-Dr. Yang.
-Chief Fox.
Look at all these patients.
Are they all refugees?
They come from
as far as Hai Ning.
Some have been walking
for three days.
On top of it all, many have
symptoms of the plague.
Plague?
That's horrible.
Miss Orchid.
Obstipantia, ginseng...
Check the list.
Don't take the wrong herb.
Miss Orchid.
Chief Fox,
what's wrong with you?
Nothing yet, but these sick
people are making me nervous.
l heard the Iron Monkey
was arrested. Is it true?
l had that Monkey
in my ''Crushing Serpent'' hold.
He couldn't move!
l was about to give him
a ''Flying Dragon'' punch.
-Are you hurt?
-Oh, my shoulder!
It must have been great
to finally catch him.
So many of my men
were in danger...
l had to let him go.
You always have a new move
to catch the Iron Monkey.
But you always release him.
You're giving him
too many chances.
l must owe him something
from a previous life.
He's tortured me
since l arrived here.
But one day,
I’ll tear the coward's mask off!
Chief Fox, look at your hand.
Hot! Hot!
What delicate skin!
Do you like to be touched?
My brothel
could see a soft touch.
-Get lost!
-You bitch!
Find your hookers elsewhere.
Oh, ChiefFox?
We are friends.
Please forgive me.
This clinic
is under my protection.
l won't tolerate
indecent behavior here!
Chief Fox, l am dishonored.
Allow me to save face.
1 00 taels of gold
should clear things.
How dare you bribe me
out in the open!
Take him to the jail.
How dare you?
I’m a powerful man.
Who will never meet
the governor...
without my introduction.
Go!
Chief Fox, thank you very much.
Take this ointment for your men.
Apply it to their wounds.
Soon they will feel better.
-Thank you.
-Good-bye.
I’ve been chasing
the Iron Monkey day and night.
I’m going to drop soon.
l hope he stays home tonight.
Get some rest.
Good morning, Dr. Yang.
Good morning.
You don't think
he could be the Iron Monkey?
Ahh. Everyone looks like
the Iron Monkey to me.
Hai!
Hai!
Hai!
Add more bark.
it’ll taste better.
But the soup already
tastes like a tree.
What was that?
It’s real gold
from the Iron Monkey.
Give it to me!
I’m in charge.
Who threw that at me?
''Don't be greedy. ''
I’m not greedy.
I’ll share it with everyone.
Thank you, Iron Monkey.
Thank you, Iron Monkey.
The building is falling down!
No, it's gold
from the Iron Monkey.
Bless you, Iron Monkey.
No slacking off!
There's plenty of refugees
where you came from.
l can replace you tomorrow.
Faster, or do you want
another beating?
But we haven't eaten all day.
That reminds me.
Back to work, or it's back
to the gutter l found you in.
A dead rat!
Who threw that at me?
You're disgusting!
The Iron Monkey
really exists.
Iron Monkey!
Would you like some help?
Not even this downpour
can discourage you.
You might get hurt without me.
The governor hates you
even more than he loves money.
It’s expensive
to feed nine wives.
Vegetables and bean curd again.
I’m sick of it!
You're governor,
yet we eat like peasants.
lf l hadn't hidden my gold so
well, you'd have nothing to eat.
I’d be better off in a brothel.
You think it's easy
to support the nine of you?
l suppose you want me to sell
food from the state warehouse.
And charge our refugees
a fortune.
Then you could throw us a feast.
All you care about is eating.
You can help me.
You've already taken my salary.
l don't need your tiny salary.
Open the warehouse for me!
Sir, it's a letter
from the capital!
Master, is it a promotion?
Congratulations!
The Royal Minister?
He's coming
about the Iron Monkey.
He wouldn't blame you
for anything, would he?
Why are you still here?
Capture that Monkey!
Arrest anyone who could
possibly be the Iron Monkey.
-Anyone and everyone.
-Yes, sir!
Hai! Huh!
-What do you call that stance?
-The ''Monkey's Fist.''
-''Monkey's Fist?''
-Yes.
-Come on, let's go!
-What did l do?
We know you're the Iron Monkey.
Ah-choo!
You look like a monkey.
Arrest him.
But all l did was sneeze.
You sneezed like a monkey.
Take him in!
Crushed monkey powder.
What are you selling?
Don't mention the word
''monkey''.
-Take a look yourself.
-You won't tell us?
You must be up to something!
You're coming with us!
-Hold tighter.
-Yes, dad.
Dad.
You're old enough
to walk on your own now.
Recite the herb list.
Chiretta, good for blood.
Ginseng, good for respiration.
Crocodile, to cure arthritis.
Lizard for poison.
Tin-tsi...
-Aah!
-To cure swelling, you fool.
Tin-tsi, to cure swelling,
you fool!
-Sir.
-Master Wong.
-Your herbs are all ready.
-Good. Send them to the inn.
We're leaving for Fu-shan
in the morning.
Certainly.
That's all you've made
from a whole day's work?
You think
this is a charity home?
lf you can't earn any money
for me, steal some.
-Who did that?
-Fei-hong.
You're too old
to play with this.
Shoot at me?
Go to the inn and practice your
footwork. Four hours minimum.
Go pick his pocket.
What are you doing
picking pockets at your age?
I’ll never do it again, sir.
I’ll let you go this time,
but don't do it again.
You're lucky!
l have to drill for four hours.
What's wrong with drilling?
What's wrong with stealing?
Do l have to show you?
Aah!
He's good.
Could he be the Iron Monkey?
Maybe.
Hey, you, come with us!
He stole my stuff.
l didn't see that,
but l did see you fight!
Move! Hurry up!
Don't act so innocent.
Behind those innocent faces...
one of you is that devil,
Iron Monkey.
Confess!
This doesn't
have to be unpleasant.
l don't wish to keep you
all here.
l only want the Iron Monkey.
You may all go home
just as soon as...
the Iron Monkey shows himself.
Sir, that Monkey
is flashing his butt at you!
Huh? How dare you
disgrace this court?
l hate indecency.
Take him to the dungeon.
Sir, you can eat
Monkey's brains tonight.
Don't let my wives know.
lf no one confesses, you will
each be fined fifty taels.
-Only fifty taels?
-What is appropriate?
This is serious. We should
fine them five hundred taels.
Or do these cretins
think it should be more?
-Oh, no, sir.
-Have mercy.
lf you have no money,
we have another penalty.
Iron Monkey, where are you now?
A real hero would show himself,
or do you prefer humiliation?
Huh? Ah! Ahh!
Don't you look
so very conflicted?
Torture him!
Dad! You can't do this
without any proof!
How dare you!
Is he telling you
how to govern?
You will learn to respect
my court, little boy.
Brand him now!
-He's just a kid.
-Hold it, officer.
Chief Fox, do you want
to be tortured, too?
Your Excellency,
he is only a boy.
He cannot be the Iron Monkey.
He is only a boy and cannot
pay the fine. Full penalty!
Don't move.
Aah!
Aah!
Release these innocent people!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Release them?
The only reason they're here
is to draw you out!
You're trapped!
Take your positions!
Kill him!
He's outside. Go after him!
Aah!
Your actions prove
you are not fit to govern.
Sir, you're missing an eyebrow.
What kind of monster
would shave my eyebrow?
Iron Monkey, you're no hero.
These innocent people
wouldn't be here...
if it weren't for you.
Hyah!
Aah!
Ohh, my foot!
Why is he fighting Iron Monkey?
Set the ladders now.
Aah!
Hyah!
It’s a kid!
-Fei-hong, are you all right?
-I’m fine.
Hee.
You were great.
-My father is well known in--
-Quiet, son.
-Thank you.
-Please.
He's as powerful
as the Iron Monkey.
Sir, the Iron Monkey's
appearance...
proves we're innocent.
May we leave now?
No!
You might be his partner.
Until he is caught,
no one will be released.
Very wise, sir.
Sir, be merciful!
Please let us go!
Sir, Wong Kei-ying
will arrest the Iron Monkey.
You can let them go.
Are you Wong Kei-ying
from Fu-shan?
-Yes, sir.
-Nice to meet you.
Wong Kei-ying! He's famous!
More famous than me?
Wong Kei-ying,
I’ll be merciful this time.
You have seven days
to arrest the Iron Monkey.
In the meantime,
we will hold your son.
My son?
So you won't leave town.
lf you can't catch
the Iron Monkey...
you will join your son.
Dismissed!
Am l going to be alone?
I’ll arrest him soon.
Don't worry,
I’ll keep an eye on him.
Thank you.
Set them free.
He's helping the governor
catch the Iron Monkey.
What a bastard!
Hot delicious noodles.
A bowl of noodles for you?
You'll love them.
My mother's recipe.
I’ll have a bowl, please.
Are you the one who fought
with the Iron Monkey?
-l am.
-Shame on you.
l won't sell you anything!
Go!
-Why?
-Why? Ask a fortune teller why.
I’d like two buns, please.
l don't sell buns to your kind.
My kind?
l can pay!
l wouldn't sell dirt to you!
-Nonsense.
-Wong Kei-ying is robbing me!
Help!
Wong Kei-ying is robbing me!
Bastard!
Do you want a bun?
Five taels each.
That's expensive!
That's cheap. I’m risking
my life selling to you.
l quit. I’m sorry.
Hot buns.
I’ll take twenty.
Thanks.
Are you hungry, sir?
That bun is dirty.
You must be very hungry!
I’m lucky to have this.
l haven't eaten for two days.
No one here
will sell me any food.
It can be rough
for strangers here.
Don't eat that.
Why don't you come in
and have some soup?
Soup!
I’m so hungry. Just the thought
of soup makes my stomach upset.
lf you had some rice...
Master Wong...
-How are you doing?
-Not too bad.
Be patient.
it’ll be ready soon.
Master Wong...
we grow a special chili here,
called ''Sweating.''
Just a taste, and
you'll be dripping with sweat.
Try some.
It’s terrific.
-Are you thirsty?
Save some room for soup,
all right?
l only had a sip of water
to cleanse my palate.
So l can taste your soup
better.
Use an apron the next time
you cleanse your palate.
Miss Orchid. Let me help you.
I’ll make you
some quick Cantonese dishes.
That looks delicious!
Master Wong,
you're quite a cook.
My wife passed away,
so l do all kinds of housework.
Ha ha! Master Wong...
we are honored
to have you cook for us.
It’s just simple Cantonese food.
A taste of the north
here in the south.
Let me show you
how we shred noodles here.
The first shred
is God's blessing.
The second, for good luck.
The third,
peace and prosperity.
Good!
Welcome to our home.
To new friends.
Cheers!
Master Wong,
is something wrong?
I’m thinking of my boy.
Your feast is delicious...
but my young son
is in the governor's prison.
l don't know
if he's eaten at all.
Dr. Yang, have you heard
of the Iron Monkey?
I’ve heard the rumors.
Are you looking for him?
lf l catch him,
I’ll chop his head off!
Are you his enemy?
The governor will hold my son
until l arrest the Iron Monkey.
lf l can catch him...
my boy and l
can go home to Fu-shan.
lf l don't...
What's your son's name?
-Wong Fei-hong.
-Wong Fei-hong.
l won't bother you further.
The sooner l catch the Iron
Monkey, the sooner l see my son.
Dr. Yang, Miss Orchid, I’ll
repay you for your help one day.
-Good night.
-Good luck.
Miss Orchid...
l know.
You want to save the boy now.
That dungeon
is no place for a boy.
We'll take the medicine box.
He may need it.
Give us some water.
We haven't had any for days.
Shut up in there!
Why does the child
sleep all day?
Are you all right?
Can you hear me?
Ah. Now you have to drink.
-Chief Fox!
-Open the gate.
Wong Fei-hong,
you've got a visitor.
His forehead is hot,
and his mouth is dry.
Dr. Yang,
what's wrong with him?
He can't stay here anymore.
It’s lucky we caught this.
-His plague may be contagious.
-Plague?
It’s not that bad. Don't panic.
We're not panicking.
The Royal Minister
arrives in two days.
l don't have time
to watch the boy.
l don't know
what to tell his father.
Chief Fox...
the conditions
are too poor here.
Let him stay with me.
Hmm.
Sorry to trouble you.
You all keep your mouths shut
about this!
We will.
Just get him out of here.
Dad's umbrella...
Master Wong.
Come and have a midnight snack.
Sounds good.
There's no table here,
but the food is good.
The view's not bad, either.
Help yourself.
Chief Fox, thank you
for taking care of my son.
I’m happy to help,
but for all our sakes...
capture the Iron Monkey soon.
With the Royal Minister
coming...
the governor's
running us ragged.
He's a bit on edge.
Would he harm my son?
You catch the Iron Monkey
for me...
and I’ll protect your son
for you, OK?
The Iron Monkey?
Wait for me!
Which one of you
is the Iron Monkey?
I’m Chief Fox.
You're under arrest!
The bastards kidnapped a woman!
Aah!
Uhh!
Gah!
''Shaolin Fist?''
You use Shaolin Kung-fu!
So what?
Are you students of Shaolin?
-Hai.
-Huh!
A monk?
Uhh.
Hyah!
The ''Super Eagle's Claw!''
You're a student of
the Shaolin traitor, Hin-hung?
We Shaolin are now devoted
to the Royal Minister.
Hai!
Uhh!
Hyah!
Uhh!
Dad, look out!
Here comes the Iron Monkey.
Be careful!
Fei-hong.
It’s you.
Tell dad I’m all right.
-Uhh!
The old one
worries about the young one.
The young one
worries about the old one.
As it should be.
l know who you are.
What did he say?
Ask him when he wakes up.
Miss Orchid,
your clients are waiting!
My son?
My son.
It was just
another mouth to feed.
You must earn your keep.
Back to work.
You want to join your bastard?
Bitch!
l will redeem Miss Orchid.
This is worth more
than her dead body.
Hai!
You can't come in here.
This is the governor's house.
Shit. Where is
that little bureaucrat?
Hey! You can't go in there!
You must have an invitation
to see His Excellency.
Idiot! The Royal Minister
doesn't need an invitation.
Don't hit these fools
with the Royal Fan.
Royal Fan?
l remember this house
very well...
but l didn't see you
on my last visit, hmm?
Are you new here?
l only arrived here
two years ago.
Did you check his identity?
l didn't dare!
I’m just a junior officer.
Ohh!
You're splashing too much.
Give me a kiss!
Let's see that eyebrow.
You'll have a crooked eyebrow
if you keep squirming.
Make me look good
for my subjects, sweetie.
Huh?
Hmm?
-Who are you?
-Shouldn't you be expecting me?
In the middle of the day,
and you're playing in the bath?
Huh?
Ohh!
Your Excellency.
l need to see your books.
Put some clothes on.
Yes, sir.
Hurry, I’m a very busy man.
The Royal Fan?
-Your Excellency.
-Is that really the Royal Fan?
l had the honor
of being struck by it!
Have you seen
his official seal?
I’m just the security head.
l didn't dare ask.
You're useless.
Get my clothes!
Hmm. Hmm!
Huh!
You call yourself a governor?
My six-year-old daughter
keeps better records.
Sir, please forgive me.
Pick it up.
Heh heh heh heh.
Sir, I’m afraid l have to see
your official seal.
You're green.
That's why you don't know me.
Heh heh heh heh.
Bring me my briefcase.
What happened
to all my papers?
-What's this?
-Huh?
The Iron Monkey!
Iron Monkey?
You must be joking!
The Iron Monkey is no joke, sir.
He's been terrorizing
our province for years.
Why do you think I’m here,
moron?
What l want to know is...
how could he have entered
the home of the governor...
undetected by your men?
Please forgive me.
Someone here switched
my papers with this drawing!
Call the court to order!
You all look innocent, but
one of you is the Iron Monkey.
Confess now!
-Who stole the seal?
-Hand it over!
Don't pretend to be pitiful.
Your Excellency,
a fine is in order.
I’m a kind-hearted minister.
l love my citizens.
You can't be kind-hearted
to these imbeciles.
Hmm.
He sounds familiar to me.
He sounds like you.
It proves you are his equal.
Who will confess?
I’ll have to teach you
a lesson!
Very wise of you, sir.
Teach these men some respect!
Chief Fox!
-Sir.
-l know it's you.
Give Governor Cheng
thirty lashes!
Sir, it's an order!
l can't refuse.
Do it now!
Wait!
Wait, l may have something
that can help!
What?
Ouch!
Hmm?
Your Excellency,
do these ''documents'' help?
Hmm.
It is wise of you to find
these ''documents'' so quickly.
Come over here.
Your Excellency, me again?
Hmm.
Sir.
You're too smart a man...
to be wasting your talents
in this poor town.
Thank you, sir.
I’ll deploy you
to a wealthier province.
Choose it yourself.
Choose it myself?
l can go anywhere?
I’m going to be rich.
It’s almost worth the beating.
-Prepare for our return trip.
-Yes, sir.
-Governor Cheng.
-Yes, sir.
The emperor does not want
his public suffering.
My report would be more
favorable if you could help him.
Thank you, sir.
l officially declare
the warehouse open!
OK, OK. The governor doesn't
want to release too much.
I’ve chosen my new post...
in Canton.
Do you have any advice
for dealing with the court?
That's enough.
Take it to the square.
Treat life in politics
like a dream.
Don't take things too seriously,
and you will always be at ease.
Right, sir.
My regards to the emperor.
Ginseng is good for respiration.
Crocodile to cure arthritis.
Tip-tsi is good--
You, too.
Stop hitting me!
Show me your tongue.
Come on, show me your tongue.
You have a slight fever.
Dr. Yang hasn't returned.
Let me give you some medicine.
lf you still have a fever
tonight, come back to see us.
Thank you, Miss Orchid.
''l borrowed some pills
to raise money.
When l find my dad,
l will pay you back.''
Ladies and gentlemen...
l lost my dad here.
l am short of money
to return home.
I’ve no choice but to sell
this life-saving pill.
Whatever you can pay is good.
Your slingshot saved us.
We'll help you.
Let us at him.
So, your dad roughed us up...
but where is he now?
Wong Fei-hong
doesn't need his dad.
Wong Fei-hong, run!
He's headed for the cafés.
Watch out! Coming through!
-Aah!
-Ai!
Hyah!
Nice moves. Well done.
Thank you.
Watch out. Hot water.
Some hot water for you!
-Ooh! Ooh! Aah!
-Ha!
Ha!
Hmm!
That was
a really expensive table!
You little bastard!
Aah!
Give me that.
Sir, this will pay
for your table. Enough?
-It’s more than enough!
-This'll make us even.
My Kung-fu is pretty good.
Wong Fei-hong, you're great!
Do you accept any students?
I’m not qualified to teach.
Hey, you punks!
Which one of you
is Wong Fei-hong?
That's him.
This is your ''dragon''?
He's not even a worm.
He's too small to fight.
l may not be big,
but I’m not afraid of you.
You should be,
you little show-off!
Quite powerful!
Uhh!
At least l don't
show off my butt.
Ohh!
I’ll race you.
Ohh!
You can't even follow me.
lf l can't beat you down,
I’ll give up martial arts.
Then give up now.
Did you really quit so easily?
Over here show-off.
I’m warning you,
you're going to hurt yourself.
Aah! Uhh!
-Stop toying with him.
-Shut up! He was lucky.
What was that?
Ooh!
Stone!
Fei-hong, get up.
Come on.
Why did you sneak away?
I’m sorry,
but l have to find my dad.
Maybe l can help you.
Let's go.
Welcome, your Excellency!
Summon the governor.
Summon the governor.
Summon me? Is the Royal Minister
back again?
Who does this monk think he is?
Fine him
and put him in the dungeon.
That's no way to greet
the Royal Minister!
You're the Royal Minister?
Another one!
l have to see
your official seal this time.
l hope this meets
with your approval!
He's not an impostor.
Your Excellency.
I’m hungry now.
Bring me some lunch.
Yes.
Prepare some vegetarian dishes
for the minister.
Yes.
His Excellency would like
chicken and shark-fin soup.
Of course. Of course.
The rod is blind;
it seeks all injustice.
A strong force
flows from north to south.
Fei-hong, your turn.
Seek the way.
''Fisherman's Paddle. ''
''Double Flight from the Sea.''
Old branches on the ground...
open both up and down.
You enjoy teaching him.
He reminds me of myself
when l was younger.
Before they murdered
your father?
The boy is very talented.
You can't bring
your father back.
No, but l can teach
this boy...
a little
of what my father taught me.
Fei-hong, come.
They should be together.
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
Look at you.
Don't worry, dad. l was good.
l haven't let you down.
Good!
Now if only we could go home.
Thank you for rescuing my son.
My pleasure.
Please.
They say even more
refugees are headed here.
Then the Iron Monkey
will be out tonight.
Fei-hong, here.
Fei-hong, what's that?
You can't eat roast duck.
Let go!
He is still recovering
and should be on a diet.
Dr. Yang, you eat it.
With the medicine l gave him,
he doesn't need to diet.
We monks are austere.
A simple diet
is best for good health.
Fei-hong is still young.
Roast duck is so greasy.
His stomach is too weak
for greasy food.
It’s better to eat less.
Don't look at it that way.
And how should l look at it?
He hasn't had an appetite
until today.
Now, his hunger has returned.
It doesn't matter what he eats
so long as he has an appetite.
We'll be here all night
if you keep quarreling.
I’m sorry.
You're supposed to be a monk?
How can you steal
all nine of my wives?
''Don't take politics
too seriously...
and you will always be
at ease.''
No one
can escape death, my love...
but you left me all alone.
l pray you will forgive
what l have to do.
l can't afford to bury you
unless l sell myself.
You don't have to do that.
Take this money
and bury your husband.
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.
I’ll bury you instead!
It’s a trap.
The Royal Minister
will have your hide.
Surrender.
You can't handle the two of us.
You work for the Royal Minister?
The minister controls
all the Shaolin monks now.
Unbelievable.
You've ruined
the Shaolin society.
Hyah!
The ''Virgin's Sword'' stance.
You may be ugly,
but l doubt you're a virgin.
Uhh!
Do you think
you should wear white?
-Uhh!
Too bad this is the dull side.
Ooh! Uhh!
Aah!
Uhh! Uhh.
Pathetic! That's
what you call excellence?
Hmm!
I’ll show you excellence!
Shaolin ''Buddha's Palm.''
You're powerful
for an ordinary man!
And wise--you know
the poisoned ''Buddha's Palm''!
It’s nothing special.
I’ll show you
my ''Nothing Special.''
Hai!
You won't last thirty minutes
before the poison kills you.
Iron Monkey?
-''Shaolin Fist?''
-The Shaolin traitor?
Ha ha ha ha! I’m the Royal
Minister, Hin-hung, now.
You betrayed the Shaolin to
become the emperor's henchman.
Birds live for food.
Men live for fortune.
Preach that
to your dead colleagues.
-Tell me your name.
-I’m Wong Kei-ying.
Wong Kei-ying,
your Kung-fu's unique.
You're right.
l invented the ''Shadow Kick.''
I’m going to kick you
into the shadows.
Ai!
Huh?
Ahh!
Hmm!
Uhh!
Are you all right?
What happened to you?
Bring me the needles.
Ohh!
l was hit
by the ''Buddha's Palm. ''
You must release
the poisoned blood.
Quickly.
Uh!
Unh! Ohh!
Ahh.
Uhh.
Now, get the antidote.
Centipede.
Scorpion tail.
Viper.
Lizard.
Wake up.
Please. You have to help me.
Do l need anything else?
Wake up.
Dr. Yang.
Are you OK, dad?
Fei-hong, I’m hurt.
Find Dr. Yang now.
What's going on?
The Iron Monkey?
-What are you doing? Let go!
-He isn't the Iron Monkey!
How dare you confront
your father?
Ah!
Master Wong.
Is Dr. Yang the Iron Monkey?
l just want to inspect
his wound.
-Silly kid!
-Ah! Heh heh.
l haven't forgotten
what you've done for us.
''The Buddha's Palm!''
Poison against poison.
It’s a brilliant treatment.
Extraordinary.
-Fei-hong, get the pen and ink.
-Yes, dad!
-Poison will change.
-Poison will change.
-Poison for blood.
-Poison for blood.
Release the blood
and revitalize the soul.
Your fate
is in the palm of my hand.
-Emergency aid.
-Emergency aid.
-Single chance for life.
-Single chance for life.
Every breath
brings you closer to death.
Hurry up! Cure him!
The Iron Monkey and
Wong Kei-ying are both hurt.
Check all the clinics.
Arrest those who are hurt!
Yes, sir!
This medicine
can work for many diseases...
but it is
a most powerful antidote...
for all kinds of poisons.
It’s amazing!
l would never have thought
to treat poison with poison.
So, what do you plan to do now?
l don't know what to do.
l can't turn you in, but
if l don't make an arrest...
the governor will track me down
in Fu-shan.
Now you know
why we need an Iron Monkey.
Our province was corrupted back
when my father was a courtier.
My father exposed his
colleagues to the governor...
but he'd known all along.
That day,
my father didn't come home.
Hmmph.
Maybe someday,
we'll have honest officials...
and the Iron Monkey can retire.
-Who is it?
-Chief Fox!
-Where is Dr. Yang?
-He's out.
-Where's Wong Fei-hong?
-He is with Dr. Yang.
Shit!
The Royal Minister
wants them arrested.
Why?
Don't play games.
l know more than you think.
-Master Wong...
-l heard.
What am l supposed to do now?
Let's go back to Fu-shan.
You have to go home
alone tonight.
lf l leave too,
the governor's men will follow.
I’ll come home when it's safe.
No matter what, son...
l promise l will make it back.
Yes, dad.
Fei-hong,
you must be strong now.
l understand.
A strong man sheds blood
before he sheds tears.
Don't worry, dad.
Dr. Yang,
please watch after my dad.
Don't worry about me, dad.
Fei-hong,
have you forgotten my words?
You must be strong!
What did I just say to you?
A strong man sheds blood...
before he sheds tears.
Master Wong, we must go now.
OK.
Don't worry.
I’ll take care of Fei-hong.
Fei-hong, go on.
I’ll answer it.
Open the door!
Now this is a pretty girl!
You're supposed to be a monk.
Where's your respect
for tradition?
Some monks can appreciate
pretty girls.
We can all enjoy tonight.
You don't want our lives
to be empty.
''Grappling Hands''?
Ohh!
Her Kung-fu is strong!
Maybe the Iron Monkey
is a woman!
Uhh!
Hai!
Aah!
Aah!
Huh!
l won't be humiliated
by a woman.
Sleeping powder.
It’s working.
Uhh!
Aah!
Uhh!
Now we're going
to have some fun.
l hope you're in the mood
to entertain tonight.
Go to hell, you bastards.
You aren't monks.
You're a disgrace!
This little boy
has a death wish!
Get out of here.
''Carry the Bow''
and ''Shoot the Moon.''
Uhh!
''Monkey's Rod.''
''Double Flight from the Sea.''
''Fisherman's Paddle.''
What are you chanting?
Too many stances.
Don't let his stances
disturb you.
“Rod that Sweeps Away
injustice.”
Very powerful.
“A Strong Force
Flows from North to South.”
Don't let him chant!
No chanting.
“The Top Turns Over the Sky.”
“The Bottom Turns
Under the Earth.”
-”Fix the Body.”
-Fix what?
Hmm?
Fix your head. Fix your toes.
Left, right, left, right.
Chin.
“Golden Snake
Goes into the Hole.”
“Golden Snake
Comes Out of the Hole.”
Uhh uhh uhh.
Fix the chin again.
Hyah!
Old witch,
how dare you bully a kid?
Why not?
No “Shadow Kick.”
Hai!
Rebel monks took Fei-hong.
-What?
-Are you all right?
Orchid, what happened to you?
Miss Orchid?
Orchid.
-Huh?
Tell us where your father is.
You're lucky he's not here...
or he'd Shadow Kick
your bald head!
You won't be so tough
after we finish with you!
lf we kill him, sir,
we'll never find Wong Kei-ying.
Shut up, lackey.
I’m the head of security here.
How dare you?
Chief Fox.
Yaah!
-Aah!
It’s a trap!
Let the boy go.
What do you care about a kid?
What do you care?
Hin-hung, these are for you!
Catch Fei-hong!
The “Flying Sleeves”!
Come to me!
Uhh!
l don't care which of you
is the Iron Monkey.
You're both going to die.
Kill them now.
-Straight to hell!
Oh, no, you don't!
Hello, Miss Orchid.
You will all die now!
Wah!
The ugly virgin again?
Get the boy out of here.
Sir...help me...
l can handle him.
Get out of here!
Hmm?
“Flying Sleeves”?
Why not “Buddha's Palm”?
You were lucky to survive...
but a smarter man
would have stayed away.
Your sect killed my father.
Let's make it
a family tradition.
Yaah!
Hurry up!
Stay where you are!
This game is over.
You will never escape me.
And you'll never rest easy,
you traitor.
You're no better than
that common criminal...
the Iron Monkey.
You have no right
to call me a traitor.
Stop pretending
to be righteous.
lf we didn't have
vermin like you...
there would be no need
for the Iron Monkey.
Ahh!
Come here.
Yaah!
Ahh!
Over here, traitor.
Hmm!
Fei-hong! Stay back!
Up to the poles!
Dad, get down
before it's too late!
Go for his legs.
Grab my hand!
Aah!
Yaah!
Iron Monkey, come over here.
The pole is breaking.
Balance on the ends!
Having trouble standing?
Don't worry about us.
That pole won't last long.
They won't even find
your ashes.
Flip me into the air.
Aah!
Throw us the rods!
Catch.
Hyah! Uhh!
Dad.
Everything’s OK.
l didn't think
l was going to make it.
We don't want to be found here.
Let's go.
Master Wong,
when will we meet again?
Why don't you visit us
in Fu-shan?
Miss Orchid, you'll come.
l wanted to say good-bye.
Chief Fox,
we almost missed you.
Sorry, but I’m busy
chasing the Iron Monkey.
The new governor has arrived.
Can we hope for a just one?
We have to say good-bye.
Fei-hong, let's go.
Safe travels, my friends.
