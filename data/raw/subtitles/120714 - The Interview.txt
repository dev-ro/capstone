- Don't move!
- Don't move!
Get down on the floor!
Get down right now!
Get down on the floor!
I said don't fucking move!
No.
- What's your full name?
- Please don't hurt me.
You wet your bloody self, huh?
Who are you?
- This his stuff?
- Yeah.
I'm sure they got everything
that wasn't nailed down.
Eddie Fleming,
this is your life.
Date of birth?
Date of birth.
22nd of August 1956.
- Do you live at this address?
- Um, yes.
Do you own this place,
Mr. Fleming?
Um, no.
No, I rent.
- How was it?
- Piece of cake.
Once we were in, he knew
who we were, he was, uh...
- What?
- Reasonable.
What... What offense?
You're joking.
Look, I'm sorry I didn't realize
who you were.
But you did break down my door.
Please.
What's all this about?
Have you got anything here
that you shouldn't have?
What?
Remember, he's only a suspect,
so no tunnel vision.
Well, I haven't stolen anything.
What's he doing?
That's not stolen!
He...
Look, he's taking my things!
Mr. Fleming, we'd like
you to come down to our office.
We've got a few questions
to put to you.
What office?
Where?
Down at the station,
Mr. Fleming.
Why? Do I have to?
Well, you... you can ask me
anything you want here.
I mean, what do you want
to know?
It's a bit more complicated
than that, Mr. Fleming.
You don't have a choice, right?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Um, look.
I can't go like this.
Can I change my clothes, please?
Turn around.
Look.
I didn't realize...
You don't need to do this.
Just get on with it, yeah?
Uh, could somebody
help me, please?
Mr. Fleming, are you all right?
We've been asking about you.
- What is this?
- I don't know. I don't know.
I'll... I'll be back soon,
and then I'll explain.
I'm really sorry.
What's going on up there?
They're taking Mr. Fleming away.
Sir.
CIB, Prior, 21387.
Thank you.
Gee, I like your shoes.
Italian, aren't they?
No.
Where'd you get them?
- David Jones.
- David Jones.
Really?
You want a coffee?
You sure you won't,
uh, wet your pants?
I'm sorry to keep you
waiting so long, Mr. Fleming.
I'm sure you understand.
Well, no. No.
I don't understand.
You're here to help us
with our inquiries.
What inquiries?
How's your coffee, Mr. Fleming?
It's fine.
Think I'll be here very long?
That depends,
doesn't it, Mr. Fleming?
Depends on what?
Do you think I could,
uh, get these off, please?
Thank you.
Do you drive a car, Mr. Fleming?
Car?
No, I don't.
Ever owned a car?
Yeah, of course,
till I was retrenched.
Can't rent a car on the dole,
you know.
No, I don't suppose you can.
A bit tough, is it?
Oh, it's just one
of the many things
you find you can
actually do without.
Wayne?
What?
Senior Detective to you.
Yes, sir.
The newspapers?
Yeah.
Right.
I want you to go through
every single of them.
- All of them?
- Every single bloody one.
You better not miss anything.
Yes, sir.
There's got to be thousands
of us.
I used to live well.
Good job, you know.
Till everything
went down the drain.
Now it's just nothing.
I was one of 200
retrenched in the company.
I lost my house and my wife.
I lost it all.
Why?
Is that a crime?
No, Mr. Fleming, it's not.
And you're right.
There are a lot of people
in a similar position.
I got a brother-in-law
in the same situation.
Well, perhaps.
But he's not sitting
in a police station
talking to the likes of you.
No.
No, he's not.
Who are you?
I mean, what do you really want?
I'm gonna start
a formal interview, Mr. Fleming.
Uh, could I have
something to eat please?
Not bloody likely.
It's just that
I haven't eaten anything
since yesterday afternoon.
We'll see what we can do.
Interview between
Detective Sergeant John Steele
and Edward Fleming,
Melbourne CIB.
Detective Senior Constable
Wayne Prior also present.
What is your full
and correct name?
Edward Rodney Fleming.
Do you agree the time
is now 7:57 a.m.?
Yes.
Mr. Fleming... I intend
to ask you some questions
in relation to the theft
of a motor vehicle,
registration number KCR-109.
What, s-stolen car?
What, you break down my door
for a stolen car
and you handcuff me
for a stolen car?!
What stolen car?! I don't know
anything about a stolen car!
Will you sit down, please,
Mr. Fleming?
Sit down, please.
I must advise you that you do
not have to say or do anything.
But anything you say or do
may be given in evidence.
Do you understand that?
- I believe it.
- Good.
Then you won't have a problem
telling me about your movements.
No, I don't have a problem
telling you anything
if only you'll actually
ask me something.
Did you go out yesterday?
Yesterday?
Yes.
I went to the local
grocery shop.
And what'd you get?
Uh, tinned food, um, newspapers,
milk, that sort of thing.
Why do you shop
at the local grocery shop?
Isn't it a bit more expensive
than a supermarket,
you know, for somebody
that's on the dole?
If I'm running a bit short,
they let me have a tab.
And I like them.
They're friendly.
Is that why you shop there
every day, is it?
Someone to talk to?
I never really thought about it
before.
But yeah, I suppose
that's part of it.
I mean, you try losing your job,
livelihood, your family.
You see how many friends
you've got left.
Not many, I guess.
Do you agree that the time
is now 7:59 a.m.?
Yes.
I intend to interrupt
this interview
for the purpose of making
further inquiries.
- What, is that it?
- No, no, not yet.
What about the stolen car?
What about it?
Well, y-you were gonna ask me
some questions about it.
All in good time, Mr. Fleming.
That rattled the bastard.
There's nothing from
the other tenants.
He seemed pretty straight.
What do you think?
Oh, he's a clean skin.
Get somebody back there.
Check out his local shops.
Let's dig into these people.
Yeah, we've done all that.
I want to know
about dates and times,
want to know what they think
of him,
anything they might
have noticed.
Why are we wasting our time
with this?
Come on. He's our man.
Let me talk for a bit.
Listen.
Fleming might well be
a car thief,
but if we can't make
this stand up in court,
we've got nothing.
- If it goes...
- You got that?
- Yes, John. Perfect.
- All right, then.
You keep the bloody mouth shut
and just get on with it.
Anything?
I wish.
Just a little short
on bloody evidence.
Oh, yeah. Like being
a little bit pregnant.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, uh, he's the closest fit
we've got.
All right.
So what are John's thoughts?
Well, you'd better ask him, sir.
Is there a problem?
Well, sir, all I can say
they don't still run
refresher courses.
Thank you for coming in at such
short notice, Mrs. Beecroft.
Not at all.
Now, we're not necessarily
all that advanced
from when we last spoke.
We need you to look at
some items over here
and see if you recognize
any of them.
Are you up to that?
- I hope I can be of some help.
- So do I.
Sheila, g'day.
How are you?
Fine, thanks, John.
That's good.
Now, look.
Just have a seat here for us.
There you go.
Can we get you a cup of tea,
cup of coffee or something?
- No, thank you.
- All right.
Now, these are all the items
we'd like you to have a look at.
Now, there's no hurry.
You just take your time.
But it's important
that if there is anything here
from your husband's car
that you do identify it, yeah?
- I'll do my best.
- All right.
Just take your time.
Keep it quiet.
No prompting, all right?
Yeah, yeah.
Heads up.
- Take a seat.
- Mm-hmm.
What's that bastard doing here?
The hierarchy gave him
permission.
It's got nothing to do with me.
He's gonna do a feature article
on crime squads.
Oh, the hierarchy, eh?
Make sure he spells
your name right.
Might be your name as well.
He's been asking me
about one of your inquiries.
Wants to talk to you.
No.
You tell him to get fucked.
He's got permission,
so you'll live with it.
I haven't got time
for this shit.
Mate, I deal with
thieves all the time.
Frankly, I respect a good thief.
But liars I just cannot stand.
Look.
I said I would help if I could.
And I mean it.
But how can I help
if I don't know anything?
I just want to get this
over with, please.
Good.
Mr. Fleming, we're concerned
with the theft of a motor
vehicle, as I've mentioned.
In particular a two-tone
EH Holden station wagon,
registration number KCR-109.
Yeah. I told you I don't know
any... anything about it.
Have you been
out of town recently?
How recent?
Oh, say in the last month or so.
Yes. I-I took the train
to Ballarat.
You do a bit
of country traveling, do you?
Occasionally, just to get away,
you know?
And how do you manage that
on the dole?
Well, I couldn't do it
if I wasn't.
Uh, they give you cheap travel
when you're unemployed
and they subsidize you
when you're looking for work.
Oh, that's why you're up there.
Yes.
Um, when exactly
did you go to Ballarat?
Um, two or three months ago.
I'm not sure of the date.
Well, you must have some idea.
You said you were up there
looking for work.
You must have had
an appointment.
No, it's, uh, seasonal work,
you know?
You just knock on the door.
I was too late.
It must have been frustrating.
Well, no, not really.
When you're alone, no job,
you have to make the effort.
And what effort's that?
Well, to get out and about
and keep in tune with people,
the outside world.
And what was this seasonal work?
It was a bit of fruit picking.
What, in Ballarat?
That's sheep country, isn't it?
Yes.
They also grow olives up there.
So how long did you stay?
Um, just the one night, I think.
And then I caught the train
straight back.
Right.
Can you remember the date
that you went, Mr. Fleming?
It would be helpful.
Today is the 14th.
It would have been... Yeah.
The 21st,
to the best of my recollections.
Actually, I stayed away
for two nights.
No.
Not just the one.
Yeah.
Good.
Where'd you stay?
Salvation Army hostel.
Thank God for the Salvos.
This is the car, is it?
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
You sure?
Well, where am I supposed to
have seen it?
- You've never been in it, then?
- No. How could I have been?
Look, there must be thousands
of those Holdens out there.
And I tell you I've never been
in any of them.
Now, is that it?
No. No.
Not quite.
Could we get you another cup
of coffee, Mr. Fleming?
No, but look.
If this is gonna go on
much longer,
I'm gonna have to have something
to eat, if that's possible.
Yeah. Sure.
I'll see what we can do.
I'm interrupting this interview
for the purpose of making
further inquiries.
Nothing.
Never identified a bloody thing.
How's she coping?
Not real well.
I'm gonna get some of this stuff
sent over to forensic.
I need this checked.
Oh, we're getting somewhere.
Prick admits he's been
to Ballarat, does he?
Here we go.
Train ticket to Ballarat
dated the 21st.
So far, he's a truth-teller.
I've checked his local grocer.
Owner reckons he's a top bloke,
and he never misses a day
unless he's crook.
Always pays his bill, polite,
friendly, blah-dee-fucking-blah,
the sort of arsehole
you really can't stand.
Some of the handwriting samples
from the apartment
are similar to the ones
we've got.
Right.
We'll let the room keep working
on him for a while.
What else?
I got Prowse head down,
arse up in the newspapers.
So far, they're all there
for the relevant dates,
which doesn't help our case.
And, uh, there's not much else
at the moment.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll get the Ballarat CIB
to check out the Salvos.
And I'll give the railways
a call.
No, no.
Flick it to Prowse.
Fleming's a lonely sort
of person.
The more he's encouraged,
the more he talks.
Let's get on with it.
John.
How you going?
Wallsy.
What can I do for you?
Well, Inspector Jackson said
I might have a word with you.
Oh, is that right?
That's bloody big of him.
Listen, mate.
Give me a ring later in the day.
I got an interview going
at the moment.
Wouldn't be the Beecroft bloke?
I saw his missus in here.
You know, I always thought
he might've done a runner.
Now, how would you know
it was his missus?
I heard the name.
Just assumed, you know?
No, I don't know.
It's not Beecroft, is it?
A bigger fish.
You got a hide like a bloody
rhinoceros, haven't you?
The last story you did
on this office,
you published a photo
you nicked off my desk.
You killed
the whole bloody inquiry.
Well, no wonder you haven't
been returning my calls.
Now, what makes you think
I nicked it?
Listen, mate. Don't come
in that bloody line with me.
This wouldn't have something
to do
with little closet copper
sitting over there, would it?
Hey, I know half the coppers
in the job, including you.
Still in one piece, is he?
Fuck off.
Interview between Detective
Sergeant John Steele
and Edward Rodney Fleming
recommenced.
Time is now 8:48 a.m.
Detective Senior Constable
Wayne Prior also present.
Mr. Fleming, have you ever
heard of an Andrew Beecroft?
Andrew Beecroft.
No, I don't think so.
Where should I know him from?
Well, you both got something
in common.
- We do?
- Yeah.
You're both out of work.
I see.
Look, can I have something
to eat soon?
Yes.
It's on its way.
We'd like you to have a look
at this, Mr. Fleming.
W-What is it?
Well, what does it say?
It's just a transfer document
for a motor vehicle.
For the record,
it's the transfer of ownership
of Mr. Beecroft's car,
registration number KCR-109.
So what's it got to do with me?
Can you read the signatures
on the bottom?
Um, A. Beecroft and Paul...
No.
Peter Williams.
A few months ago, Mr. Beecroft
was driving to Horsham
to start a new job
at the local granary
when, for no apparent reason,
he just sold his car
to a bloke called
Peter Williams.
He sold it to a stool.
I don't understand.
Oh, yes, you do, Mr. Fleming.
Have another look
at the transfer document.
Well, what am I
supposed to be looking for?
Williams tried to make it
look like Beecroft
had signed the car over to him.
Now, forensic have had a look
at that document,
and we know that both
those signatures were forged.
Really?
What's that got to do with me?
Have you ever used the name
Peter Williams?
Of course not.
I've only got one name,
and it's Fleming.
- Ever had your name changed?
- No.
Have you used an alias?
Absolutely not.
That's outrageous.
I ask you to have another look
at those signatures.
Do you recognize either of them?
A. Beecroft and Peter Williams.
They're just names to me.
Why am I supposed to recognize
them?
This is from my notebook.
Yes. We picked it up
at your place this morning.
What are you doing?
Oh, come on, Mr. Fleming.
You know.
Well, you're not gonna tell me
my writing's the same
as these signatures.
It's like they don't even look
the same.
They're both your handwriting,
Mr. Fleming.
This is a lie.
I don't believe you.
What is this?
You know much about the
characteristics of handwriting,
do you, Mr. Fleming?
Please. I don't understand.
I didn't steal any car.
I don't know any Andrew Beecroft
or a Peter Williams.
Their handwriting's
nothing like mine.
Look at it!
Well, this is from
a rental agreement on my flat.
What are you doing with it?
We got it from your estate agent
a while back.
Look, I think you'd better tell
me exactly what this is about.
Would you care to have a look
at the handwriting
on the transfer document again?
Now, our handwriting experts
have made a detailed comparison.
It's your handwriting.
Well, maybe you'd better get
new handwriting experts,
'cause I've never seen
that slip,
and I never wrote
those signatures!
We've got something else
here for you.
I'd like to see
if you can identify this.
It's a letter.
Yeah, it's a letter.
I hope you're not suggesting
this is also my handwriting.
Well, that's what the document-
examination expert states.
Well, I'm sorry,
but it's completely wrong.
I've never written like that
in my life.
All the writing characteristics
match up,
same as the ones
in the other documents here.
Well, m-maybe they're the same,
but I didn't write them.
I'll show you how I write.
No, no.
That's all right, Mr. Fleming.
But I must advise you
that our forensic people
are checking this writing paper
against writing pads
from your apartment
to see if they're
from the same source.
I did not write that letter,
and that is not my paper.
And if you think you
can intimidate me into saying
whatever it is you want to hear,
then you can think again.
No one's trying to intimidate
you, Mr. Fleming.
There are just certain questions
that have to be put to you.
That's my job.
Yeah.
Well, it's not much of a job.
Yes. Well, sometimes it feels
like that to me, too.
But look at the facts.
That letter was sent
to Beecroft's wife
about eight weeks ago.
It says that Beecroft
was supposedly doing
a lot of driving around.
And he was so busy
that he got Williams
to write the letter.
It also says that he sold
his car to Williams.
Now, what does that sound like
to you?
I don't know.
It sounds a bit thin, you know,
like somebody's trying to
cover up.
Yes.
We think so, too.
It also sounds like somebody
trying to bide their time.
And we think that somebody
is Peter Williams.
So what about Beecroft?
I mean, why can't you ask him?
Because I'm asking you.
Now, we've got a file here from
the central bureau in Sydney.
And it appears
from the computer printout
that you had some dealings
with the police in Goulburn.
Oh, come on.
That was...
That was 26 years ago.
I used a car for a joyride.
I was 15.
And I tried to run away
from home.
I was a kid, for heaven's sake.
I was having a few problems.
I'm sorry.
What, it's a crime to be 15?
I mean, what the hell
has any of this got to do
with me being here?!
Well, what it's got to do with,
Mr. Fleming,
is that you just told us
you've never used an alias.
Oh, you're joking.
Look, I don't even remember.
I mean...
it's a common enough name.
There must be thousands
of Peter Williamses around.
Yes, but there's only half a
dozen ever used it as an alias.
And only one of them
matches the handwriting
on these documents.
You actually think you know
what you're doing, don't you?
You actually believe this.
I mean, have you ever ever...
Even talked to Andrew Beecroft?
I mean, have... have you ever...
Ever even bothered?
I'd love to.
But I'm afraid it seems
that Mr. Beecroft's missing.
Oh, he's missing.
Just like that,
you're telling me he's missing.
Just like that.
I want to see a solicitor.
Certainly.
No problem.
Interview interrupted
for Mr. Fleming to contact
a legal representative.
Do you agree that the time
is now 8:59 a.m.?
Yes, thank you.
See to it, will you,
Senior Constable?
Now, what were you running away
from?
What?
You said you were trying to
run away from home.
I have no idea.
I was 15.
You know, I tried to run away
when I was 15.
I brought this little pup home
from school one day.
It was a cute little thing.
Me old man, he made me drown it.
I remember it as clear as day.
Funny, isn't it,
how the bad things
that happen to you at that age,
they seem to stay with you
all your life.
I want to see a solicitor.
There's the bloody phone book.
And there's the bloody phone.
It's under "L" for "lawyer."
His first lie.
Your old man that big a prick?
Don't be bloody stupid, mate.
My old man would've sat there
and cried
if anyone had drowned a pup.
It's him.
It's bloody well him.
We'll see.
Twenty-six years ago.
We have Tommy Albarn
or Ian Goldman.
He goes back that far.
I'll brief the ayatollah.
Yes, that's right.
I think we're gonna need
a lot more time with him.
Pity the bloke
Fleming sold the car to died.
We had him by the balls.
Well, you've still got
his statement.
Yeah, but that's not gonna do us
much good, is it,
in court without the man
himself?
Well, his description doesn't
quite look like Fleming to me.
Well, they asked me
about a stolen car.
And then they said
that the owner was missing.
And they keep on
about handwriting.
I don't know what's happening.
I can't handle it.
We've got enough to charge him
with theft of the motor vehicle.
The decision is,
can we take it any further?
How sure are you about this?
I mean, we barked up the
wrong tree on this one before.
Jesus.
What do you mean, "we"?
That wasn't my stump-up.
No, I won't.
Okay.
There'll be someone here soon.
Well... you can wait for them
in your birdcage.
How's his demeanor?
Wants to see a solicitor,
so we have to wait for that.
But you can't shut him up, so
he's tying himself to a story.
Well, don't let him go cold.
All finished?
Christ, it's like a fucking
railway station around here.
Thought I told you to piss off.
Oh, come on.
You know I can be of help
to you here.
I got my sources.
I can be useful.
More ways than one.
Better get rid of this arsehole,
will you?
Make yourself scarce.
So had a cup of tea
with supergrass, did you?
Don't be a silly bastard.
I wouldn't put him
in that category.
Oh, he might tell me
who he was rooting,
but not who you got
in the interview room.
No, I need to get a bit more
on him
before I can get him
over that line yet.
You arsehole.
Where do you blokes do training
on interview techniques?
Well, funny you should
mention that,
because I was told
that some of the young D's
think their sergeants need a
refresher course in interviewing
to bring them up to scratch.
Really?
Really.
You do know which side your
bread's buttered, don't you?
See you later.
Let's stretch our legs a bit.
Where are we going?
Who the fuck do you think
you are?
You've been in the job
for five fucking minutes,
and you think you know
everything.
You say another word about me
or this investigation
behind my back,
and I'll have you transferred
out of here for good.
- You understand?
- What?
You understand?!
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
What's the problem, mate?
Loyalty is what I expect, mate.
And don't you ever forget it!
- What?
- All right?
Don't you ever gamble my future
'cause you think you know more
or you can get away
with something.
I've seen more shit than you can
possibly imagine, all right?
All right.
What's this all about, huh?
Talk to me.
Talk to me, Steele.
Mate, there are too many people
around here
with their own agendas.
Don't... Don't you make
the same mistake.
Refresher course, my arse.
Well, it's no good getting
excited about handwriting.
It's highly disputable
in a courtroom.
It's not even a science.
It's just one expert's opinion
against another's.
They know it.
Yeah, but why are they
doing this to me?
Well, what's more important is,
can you verify where you were
and what you were doing
at the time?
Well, yes.
I took the train to Ballarat.
I told them where I stayed.
They can check... check it all.
That puts you in the vicinity
at the time.
So I advise you to make
absolutely no comment,
Mr. Fleming.
I know how these bastards
operate.
But I never saw the car,
let alone this missing person.
Well, they're going nowhere
with that.
There's dozens of reasons
why people go missing,
usually domestic or financial.
Well, is that all?
I mean, isn't there
anything else you can do?
Learn to the say the words
"No comment."
Right.
And how long can they hold me?
Unfortunately, it's what
they call reasonable time.
For a stolen car,
say five or six hours.
It's up to them.
I don't think I can handle it.
Can you stay with me?
Uh, well... if I stay,
which, of course, I can,
they'll subpoena me, and I'll
have to be a witness for them.
Now, I'm on your side,
not theirs.
Well, so isn't there anything
you can do to get me out?
It's just a waiting game,
Mr. Fleming.
You let them do all the work.
They either have to present
all their evidence
for you to refute
or they charge you.
So long as you offer no comment,
they're not necessarily
going to get any more
than they already have.
Knowing these people,
they've probably got stuff-all.
I haven't done anything.
No, you wouldn't be
the first person.
And under no circumstances agree
to an ID parade.
All right.
Time.
You're in deep shit,
you fucking wanker.
And you're gonna take
the fucking consequences!
Now, wake up to yourself.
Now, you've seen your solicitor,
and she's told you
to say nothing.
How do you know that?
Oh, that's what they all say.
And she'll be going out to lunch
soon,
and you're still here.
Interview between
Detective Sergeant John Steele
and Edward Rodney Fleming
recommenced at 9:48 a.m.
Detective Senior Constable
Wayne Prior also present.
You must understand,
Mr. Fleming,
that what we deal with
are facts.
And the facts are
that a car's been stolen.
And I'll give you
the opportunity to respond,
but if you can't negate
these facts,
then it leaves us, really,
with only one course of action
to take.
Your handwriting
has been identified
on the transfer document.
Do you understand?
No comment.
The transfer document
is in relation
to vehicle registration number
KCR-109.
Do you know this vehicle?
No, I don't.
You have been identified
in the company
of the registered owner
of that vehicle,
who is a missing person.
Identified?
By who?
What, now I'm supposed to
have been with someone
I've never even heard of?
All I'm doing, Mr. Fleming,
is advising you of the evidence
we're in possession of.
I'm giving you the opportunity
to respond.
You get better all the time.
What evidence?
I've just explained to you
the relevant facts.
You were in the location
that the car was stolen from.
Let me make it clearer for you.
Mr. Beecroft left the city in
his car on the 21st of January.
He drove to Ballarat
and on to Horsham.
You must understand,
Mr. Fleming,
that this is all a matter
of record.
This has all been verified.
Now, there's a roadhouse
outside Ballarat.
The owner of the establishment
was there,
and he said that there was
somebody with Mr. Beecroft.
And that somebody's description
fits you.
Oh, you must be joking.
I mean, if there is someone at
all, then he's made a mistake.
I tell you, he's wrong.
I don't think he is,
Mr. Fleming.
How many roadhouses
are around the place?
How many attendants?
You just happened to find
someone who describes me?
I mean, w-what's that?
Average height, average build...
Mr. Average?
If you feel that strongly
about it,
I'd be more than happy
to organize
an identification parade.
If you're not picked,
end of story.
Well, I can see
where you're heading.
But, I mean, there's no point
in having a solicitor
and then going
against her advice.
It's up to you.
You really are a corrupt
little man, aren't you?
We are giving you
the opportunity
to respond to the facts.
A fellow in a roadhouse, he'd
probably forget his own name.
What... What favors
did you give him?
We don't buy witnesses,
Mr. Fleming.
Your description was given to us
by this witness.
And your handwriting
identifies you
as the person handling
the stolen car.
See, I've read
about unsolved crimes.
You have to clear them
from your books,
so you charge someone.
That's what this is all about,
isn't it?
Is it?
Yeah.
The newspapers are full of it.
You know, unsolved crimes...
murders, what have you.
Maybe, Mr. Fleming.
But murder?
That's a bit much.
A man with no job or prospects,
you know, lives alone,
goes up to the country
now and then.
It's perfect for you.
Beecroft and his car go missing.
And you're right, Sergeant.
It doesn't look good.
Is there anyone else
you're looking for?
My God, you know?
Went for a joyride as a kid,
and now I'm a car thief.
God knows what else.
As I said,
the letter signed Peter Williams
plus the transfer of ownership
from Mr. Beecroft
to a Peter Williams
are both in your handwriting.
Must have been uncomfortable.
All that driving around
in the heat, summer,
asking questions.
So now you have nothing, huh?
You're looking to save
your own skins.
It won't work.
I haven't been to Horsham
for years.
As I've told you,
I haven't been out of town
except for Ballarat.
You show me where I've ever had
enough money to get to Horsham.
We have witnesses who saw you,
Mr. Fleming.
Witnesses who saw someone
like me... so you say.
The time is now 9:57 a.m.
I'm interrupting this interview
for the purpose of making
further inquiries.
Perhaps one witness could
be discredited, you fuckwit.
But not three.
Beecroft is missing.
I have heard his name before.
It's been in the papers.
You think he's dead, don't you?
You think that I had something
to do with it.
No, no.
No.
No one's accusing you of that.
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just helping us
with our inquiries
into a stolen car.
It would be logical
to think that I knew
something of his whereabouts.
Wouldn't it?
Why?
Do you?
No. How many times
do I have to tell you?
Do I have to swear on the Bible
or something?
The bigger the oath,
the bigger the lie.
Like the man said, it's about
a fucking stolen fucking car,
you fucking fuckwit.
Well, is he allowed
to talk to me like that?
I'll talk to you how I want.
Now, you're fucked for the car,
and we're gonna charge you
for it.
So you may as well tell us
about it,
and we won't oppose bail.
As I said, we're only interested
in the stolen car.
I don't believe you.
And who else is missing, hmm?
Four or five?
All those people the papers
have been going berserk over.
That's where you're headed.
You're so bloody desperate,
you picked on me,
some nobody
who lives on his own.
I'm not stupid, Sergeant,
and you know it,
so don't patronize me.
What I want to know is
who the hell do you people think
you are?
You either charge me
or you let me out of here.
Well... look.
It's not as simple as that.
Well, if you believe this
nonsense, then you prove it.
You know there's only one
real way to do that, don't you?
What's that?
Find his body.
Exactly how long
have you had him?
Five hours.
You were brought in
to get results, John.
This is not going our way,
and now we've got his solicitor
on our back.
No bother with his solicitor.
It's 60-40 our way.
Just no admissions yet.
Not strong enough.
We run with that
and you're wrong,
it'll cost the department
thousands.
You can't do better than this,
we'll have to let him go.
No way.
Not while he's still talking.
Half an hour.
That's it.
Any longer,
we're heading into deep water.
He's made mention of a body.
Body?
Whose body?
Why didn't you say this
straight out?
He said we'll never find
Beecroft's body.
We'd like to run with it
a bit longer.
Are you serious?
That's what we said.
He say this on tape?
No, no.
He's a bit too clever for that.
The tapes were off.
He give you any idea
where the body might be?
No.
Give you anything else?
Yes.
The five other missing people
in similar circumstances.
And he brought that one up
himself.
What?
Where he is now?
He's upstairs.
He's agreed to be fingerprinted.
Why?
We've already got them on file.
Any IDs from prints,
crime-scene section?
No, not yet.
We need a new set.
Don't lie to me, John.
You're kicking into the wind.
You wouldn't have let him
out of that interview room
for two seconds
if he was running like that.
I'm the one in there.
Don't tell me how to run it.
We needed to back off a bit.
He was starting to take control.
You got nothing to go on,
have you?
You can't afford
any more complaints.
It'll be your arse hanging out
in the breeze.
You needn't look around for me
this time.
This time?
With respect, sir,
you just told me I was
brought in here to get results.
Two hours.
That's it.
Get out of here.
- Have you check the graph?
- Not yet.
I'm still running through
the papers.
Come on!
Then flick it to Max or someone.
Shit.
Now, why are they all
harmless middle-aged people?
What the bloody hell happened
to him back in Darwin?
What's he acting out here?
Any markings, drawings?
N'est-ce pas, Sergeant.
Just crosswords.
Nothing of value.
All right.
We're running out of time.
If we don't come up with
something in the next two hours
between forensics
and newspapers,
we're gonna have to let him go.
- Two hours?
- So no more bloody threats.
I haven't threatened
the prick yet.
Don't talk shit.
We treat him with kid gloves.
Now, it's going all right.
Fucking bullshit!
He hasn't admitted a damn thing!
Hasn't he?
Think about it.
What sort of person says,
"Find his body," eh?
Would an innocent person
in a place like this
even think in those terms?
Induction and deduction.
They still teach that,
don't they?
Do you want my left hand?
Yes.
Just a couple more, Mr. Fleming.
That's it.
Thank you.
What about this one?
What do you call 40 lawyers at
the bottom of Port Phillip Bay?
A good start.
He's a live one.
All done?
Look, I'm trying to help, okay?
I just wish you'd listen to me.
Yes.
I know, Mr. Fleming.
It is appreciated.
Now, let's go back downstairs.
Oh, not again.
Is that really necessary?
Is there anything we can get
for you, Mr. Fleming?
Anything you need?
Yep.
Ticket out of here.
And for the young gent's time,
some food.
Looks like a lot of success,
doesn't it?
Oh, yeah.
A few keepsakes.
Highlights of various
investigations, you know.
Trophies, huh?
Heroes?
What, are you interested
in what we do?
Yeah, certainly.
It's a... It's a very, uh,
courageous job
to go up against people
who are desperate.
And what makes you think
they're all desperate?
Oh, you know,
just what you read, you know?
Ah, your newspapers.
Yeah.
I suppose that's part of it.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
Just seems like an exciting job.
- Not all the fucking time.
- Now, hang on, hang on.
Mr. Fleming is
trying to help us.
What do you mean, Mr. Fleming?
You remember that bloke Sanders
year before last?
He... He killed all those people
in Sydney?
Yeah, I-I remember reading
about that case.
Yeah.
Bloody amazing.
Yeah.
Nobody knows why he did it.
You study these stories, do you?
Is it a serious interest?
Sometimes if there's not much
to do,
I collect
all the newspaper stories
and see what I can fathom
from it all.
- Why is that, mate?
- Oh, it's an interest.
It's always built into
something bigger than it is.
I'm not quite with you,
Mr. Fleming.
Yes, you are.
You know what I mean.
Every time someone writes
about a murder, right,
they look for some apocalyptic
reason for the killing.
People have to try to make some
sort of sense of it, don't they?
Is that what you do?
You try and make sense of it?
And I bet there's dozens
of murders on your computer,
you know,
that have no tangible reason.
I mean, let's face it...
Some people kill other people,
full stop.
You got me in here.
What a joke.
People just go ahead and do it,
you know?
Sometimes maybe for a few
dollars, maybe for nothing.
They just seem to go for it,
you know, pure and simple.
You really believe that crap?
No, no, no.
You could be right.
Some of them leave you
wondering.
It's not too hard to work out.
We were just talking
to the expert
who took your fingerprints.
I'll bet they match the ones
on your file.
Yes.
Of course.
So what does that mean?
It means we will have to charge
you with theft of the motorcar.
A car?
Who cares about a car?
I thought we were talking about
more important things.
What about kidnapping
and murder?
No, no, no, no.
No, I've yet to be convinced,
Mr. Fleming.
Convinced.
Then what am I doing here?
Well, I like to keep
an open mind.
You got that from your father,
did you?
We're all what our parents
make us, Mr. Fleming.
Are you ready to talk
about Goulburn yet?
Oh.
Must have been good if you don't
want to talk about it.
I'm starving.
I'm starving.
Let's eat, eh?
And... I'll draw you a diagram.
A diagram of what?
Where I put them.
What do you mean by "them?"
No, no.
I want to eat, please.
All right. All right.
We'll send out.
Just out of interest's sake,
uh, how many were there?
No.
This is very civilized.
This is very civilized.
Where'd you send out for this?
Just upstairs in the canteen.
You're not joining us?
No, I'm, uh, I'm not hungry.
Thanks.
Oh, you don't know
what you're missing.
Well, let's get on with it.
I can... I can eat while I talk.
Interview between
Detective Sergeant John Steele
and Edward Rodney Fleming
recommenced.
Detective Senior Constable
Wayne Prior also present.
Mr. Fleming, I intend to ask you
some questions
in relation to a missing person.
Do you agree that the time
is now 11:18 a.m.?
Mr. Fleming has nodded
in agreement.
Is that correct, Mr. Fleming?
Yes.
Good.
For you to, uh,
draw the diagram.
Right.
Well... look.
The whole thing, right,
what I was on about before...
What's that?
The... The newspapers?
Yeah, ridiculous stories.
Every time something serious
happens,
you think there has to be
some elaborate motive, you know?
What do you really know
about people's motives?
Where's it gonna lead you?
Well, hopefully the person
we're looking for.
That's rubbish.
Take Beecroft.
What motive was there?
Hmm?
You was lucky.
You got in your big car
and you drove 'round the place.
What were you doing?
Emu duty.
You were going from one scrap
to another.
And there.
Now you've found me.
What's the big reason?
What was my motive?
You tell me.
Motive for what?
You tell me.
You're still on emu duty.
You can't see it.
There's no reason for it.
Motive.
You want a motive?
All right.
I was a bit short of cash.
Beecroft came along.
It was his time.
What do you mean by "his time"?
Well, to grin at the lid.
What lid?
Well, the coffin lid.
Can you pass the mayonnaise,
please?
So how did you meet,
uh, Beecroft, Mr. Fleming?
Well... once I went to Ballarat,
I checked into the Salvos.
And then, quite late in the day,
I went walking.
And before you know it,
I'm looking for a lift
outside of the city
on the Western Highway
without a cent to my name.
I wanted to get up to Stawell
'cause I thought I might get
a job up there.
And this bloke gave me a lift.
And had you ever met him before?
No, never.
He was heading to Horsham,
so he said he'd be glad
to take me.
Make a wish.
We stopped for petrol
up around Ararat.
I saw he had some money
in his wallet,
so I guess that's where I got
the idea.
Idea for what?
Well, killing him.
Now, see, this should give you
a good idea
of what I was talking about.
You don't need a big reason
to kill somebody, right?
Beecroft had $38.
Right?
Suppose you told that
to somebody...
Killing a bloke for $38.
It wouldn't have a lot
of appeal, would it?
You'd be told you should do it
for a lot of money or revenge,
'cause, you know, you've always
got to have a good motive.
It's rubbish.
You just do it 'cause you can.
Are you saying
you killed Beecroft?
Yeah, I guess so.
There's a little gully up there
just outside of Stawell.
Now, we picked up
a bottle of scotch,
and we drank some on the way.
So how did you kill
Beecroft, Mr. Fleming?
It's pretty weird, that one.
We're just outside of Stawell,
and by now it's getting dark.
And I spotted this little gully.
So I got him to, uh, pull in.
Told him I wanted to relieve
myself,
seeing how we'd had
a bit too much to drink.
By now it was beginning to rain,
and there was
this sort of lean-to
next to these trees on the end,
you know, middle of nowhere.
Are you prepared
to direct us to the location?
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.
We lit this small fire.
We sat and talked and finished
the bottle and fell asleep.
What, the both of you?
Yeah.
That's the weird bit.
Well, I guess I killed Beecroft,
all right.
But... actually,
I didn't mean to.
What do you mean,
you didn't mean to?
You just told us
that you had the idea
when you saw him open up
his wallet.
Yeah. I had the idea, all right.
But that's all it was.
Well, we both went to sleep.
Must have been around 11:00.
I'm not really sure 'cause of
all the booze and everything.
And, uh, I started having
these weird dreams,
these nightmares, you know?
Now, this part
sounds like a story.
But I swear to God,
it's the truth.
I had these nightmares.
And I woke up...
and they was still all there.
Who was still all there?
All these people all around me,
people everywhere.
You know?
I-I must have been still asleep.
And what'd you do then?
I picked up this bit of iron
by the fire,
and I started swinging.
It was quite strange, 'cause I
knew every one of those faces.
What were they?
Previous victims of yours?
Yeah. People I've met.
Yeah.
There were only a few of them,
but it seemed like there were
hundreds all around in the air.
And I felt a cold sweat at once,
you know?
I saw Beecroft.
And I swung harder,
and I kept swinging.
And he didn't even make a sound.
He had his eyes closed.
And I just...
I caved in his head.
When I woke up,
he was on the floor.
And... all the people
had disappeared, you know?
They never came back.
And what'd you do then?
I pulled Beecroft outside,
and I buried him.
Then I-I buried his clothes.
I took his wallet and car,
and I took off.
Can you draw us that diagram
of where you buried him?
Yeah.
Well, here's
the Western Highway.
Ararat.
Stawell.
Horsham's up here,
uh, just about there.
I was really starving.
Thanks.
And what about the others,
Mr. Fleming?
Others. I... Look.
I don't recall them too clearly.
It's what I...
It's what I mentioned before.
All those missing people,
you know?
There's a couple
in the Western District
and the rest along
the New South Wales border.
It just happens that way.
There's no particular reason.
Can you remember any of them?
No.
I can't recall exactly.
But there was this one bloke,
though,
that stands out quite a bit.
Can't really remember his name.
What a wimp.
Oh, he was, eh?
Well... he picked me up
in his car near Portsea.
And, um, we got a bit of,
uh, takeaway food
and something to drink.
And, um, later on,
I got him to pull over.
And, um, I beat the...
I beat the shit out of him
with a piece of wood.
And he was pathetic.
He was complaining and
whingeing, crying, you know?
And why'd you beat the shit
out of him?
What happened?
Nothing, you know?
I buried him in the sand.
Now, see, he was one
of those people that I saw.
Just goes to show you
how the mind works, doesn't it?
I don't know, Mr. Fleming.
How does the mind work?
Mm.
I've heard a lot of people
talk about killing.
I've always wondered
what it must feel like.
Nothing.
I mean, there's nothing to it.
To have that sort of power
over another person.
Not really.
It's remarkably easy.
So, where exactly
did you bury him?
I'd, uh, I'd have to show you
that one.
It was in the dunes.
Is there any other people
you'd like to tell us
about, Mr. Fleming?
Uh, no, not really.
You know, I could tell you five
or six.
All a bit the same, really.
When did the first one occur?
A couple of years ago.
And the first was the same
as the last.
You know, I'd belt whoever
with something,
and that'd be it.
It's a very... It's a very
insignificant thing...
you know.
But you know what?
It didn't change me.
You know, it didn't change me
at all.
That's why I say
it's all built up.
Have you ever been ill,
Mr. Fleming?
Have you... you seen a doctor
or been in a hospital
or anything?
No, not really.
Why?
A psychiatrist?
No.
I'm not mad.
So you knew what you were doing,
then?
Yes.
Of course.
Did it ever bother you?
Ever?
No. Only...
Only the dream with Beecroft.
And I think that's...
I think that was
'cause of all the booze.
That was a great meal.
Thanks a lot.
Fine.
I intend to interrupt
this interview
for the purpose of making
further inquiries.
When we do recommence,
it'll be in relation
to the Beecroft death in detail,
which will be recorded on video.
Sure.
I suppose I always knew
you'd find me... I guess.
I always knew.
Thank you.
Aren't you having one?
No.
I don't smoke.
You've waited a long time
to share that with someone,
haven't you, Mr. Fleming?
You winning?
Yeah.
Some game.
How good is this, John?
I mean,
suddenly he puts his hand up.
You sure he's not
a chronic confessor?
No, not this one.
Cozing up to a mind
like Fleming's
makes you feel sick in the guts.
If it's half as good
as it sounds,
I'll personally write you up for
a commissioner's commendation.
No, thanks.
There's a long way to go yet.
I'm gonna be tied up in this
for weeks...
Interviews, re-enactments,
getting the brief together.
Well, Prior's rounding
up the shrink.
- Any other assistance you need?
- Yeah.
We're gonna need the video
camera for the interview room,
the mobile lab photographics
for his apartment,
and we're gonna need
another search warrant.
I tell you, this bloke's
gonna run on insanity.
Good old M'Naghten's rules.
Yep.
He was suffering disease
of the mind to such an extent,
he didn't know what he was doing
was wrong.
That's up to him to prove.
Yeah. Well, it's not gonna be
fucking hard, is it?
Barry Walls had a chat to me.
I said you might have something
for the morning edition.
Oh, Jesus.
Why'd you do that?
I'm gonna be tied up here
till midnight as it is.
Well, I understand that.
But I don't want to finish up
with egg on my face.
Jesus. You can't help yourself,
can you?
You leaked the story to him
before I even knew I had
the right man.
No.
I simply told him that you were
looking at the missing persons
that he and others
were writing about.
What you want to tell him
is up to you.
Everybody wants to be famous.
You're in deep shit,
you fucking wanker.
And you're gonna take
the fucking consequences!
Now, wake up to yourself.
Like the man said, it's about
a fucking stolen fucking car,
you fucking fuckwit.
Well, is he allowed
to talk to me like that?
I'll talk to you how I want.
Now, you're fucked for the car,
and we're gonna charge you
for it.
So you may as well tell us
about it,
and we won't oppose bail.
Well, that's a threat, too.
What's more, it's inducement
and intimidation.
How could they be so stupid?
Plus, it's the same terminology
as the other complaints.
Sir, it's Prior, not Steele.
Steele is teaching bad habits
to his subordinates.
They're acting in concert.
The video proves that.
Defense counsel
is gonna eat them with this.
Are you seriously considering
putting this man
back on the street?
That's where he's going to
end up without a conviction.
And we're not gonna get one
with this,
in which case we've lost him
forever or until he kills again.
I realize that, sir.
But they've got him,
and he's a real psycho.
In whose judgment?
And what if the court decides
he's not?
Which they might.
I mean, look at him
for Christ's sake.
He'd confess to killing
his own mother
for five minutes of attention.
I hope you're right.
Look at this.
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just helping us
with our inquiries
into a stolen vehicle.
It would be logical
to think that I knew
something of his whereabouts.
Wouldn't it?
Why? Do you?
No.
No.
How many...
They had only read him
his rights on the stolen car.
They've assured him he's not
accused of anything else.
And now Steele starts
to question him
about a missing person.
This isn't even gonna get into
a courtroom.
The DPP will throw it out.
If they don't, the judge will.
Sir, it's only one question
in response
to what he's volunteered.
I know.
It doesn't matter.
The law requires them
to play fair.
Now, they've stood
behind the suspect.
They've stood over him
in a threatening manner
and have refused him food what,
three, four times?
We've got nothing.
Could we look at it again, sir?
We can't put this man
back on the street.
Well, you tell that to Steele,
because that's exactly
what he's just done.
Do you know how many times
the ethics committee
have had to look at him?
Because he gets results?
Mr. Fleming, I intend
to ask you further questions
in relation to the disappearance
of Mr. Andrew Beecroft
on or about the 21st of January
this year.
I must warn you that you are not
obliged to say or do anything,
but anything you say or do
may be given in evidence.
Do you understand that?
Yes.
You have the right
to communicate with
or attempt to communicate with
a friend or relative
to advise that person
of your whereabouts.
And you may communicate with
or attempt to communicate with
a legal practitioner.
Do you wish to contact
any of these persons?
No, no.
I'm done with it.
Do you agree that you've already
made certain admissions to me
in regard to the disappearance
of Mr. Andrew Beecroft?
Yes. Well, I've told you
what I've done.
Can you again tell me
what those admissions are?
Yes.
Um, of course,
I went to the local shop
and, of course, to Ballarat,
where I stayed with the Salvos.
Yes, but more specifically,
in relation to Mr. Beecroft.
Oh, yes.
What's the question?
You said earlier
that on the 21st of January,
you hitched a lift
in an EH Holden station wagon,
registration number KCR-109,
driven by Mr. Andrew Beecroft.
Well, as I've said,
I don't recall the make
or the color of the car.
But yes, I did get a lift
outside Ballarat at that time.
And you further stated
that you killed Andrew Beecroft
with a blow to the head
with a iron bar.
Gentlemen.
Sir, this is Mr. Edward Fleming.
Mr. Fleming,
I'd like you to meet.
Detective Inspector Jackson.
Mr. Fleming, how are you?
Well, I'm, uh, still alive,
but I'd rather be at home.
You being treated okay?
Have they got you refreshments,
a meal?
Uh, this is still part of
the formal interview, isn't it?
Yes.
The tape's still running.
I'm just ensuring
that you're okay
and that you're being treated
properly.
Well, no, I'm not okay.
What's the problem?
I'd like to t-talk to Yolanda
if that's all right.
If you have a problem,
I'd like you to state it now.
Well, I wish you'd come in
hours ago.
They broke into my house
at 5:00 this morning,
bashed me, and brought me here.
I've been trying to help
where I can,
but they...
They just won't listen.
What do you mean?
All this business
about a stolen car.
As I've already told
these gentlemen,
I know nothing
about a stolen car
or this mysterious Mr. Beecroft
who appears to be missing.
You've just confessed
to six murders
and described in detail
how you met Beecroft,
murdered him,
and disposed of his body.
What do you say to that,
Mr. Fleming?
Is that correct?
Sergeant, you know
as well as I do
that I only told you
what you wanted to hear.
You said you wanted to be
convinced.
What do you mean?
Uh, Detective Inspector,
these... policemen
have held me here all day.
I concocted a story
from what they told me...
That Beecroft and his car
went missing around Stawell.
I even told them I'd draw a map
just so that I could get a meal,
because the only way I could get
a meal and be allowed to eat it
was to tell them
what they wanted to hear.
Look at them. They lapped it up.
Couldn't get enough of it.
Are you telling me
that the admissions
that you made to Sergeant Steele
in relation to the theft
of the murder vehicle
and the murder of Mr. Beecroft
and others
was a story you made up
to get a meal?
Inspector Jackson...
I did go to Ballarat.
I do, uh, go to the local shop.
I do stay with the Salvos.
I do live on my own.
But I've not, um,
stolen any car,
let alone killed anybody!
I mean... can you accept that,
please?
Because these people won't.
I hear what you're saying,
Mr. Fleming.
But if you lied before,
how do I know
you're not lying now?
Because I've been, uh, scared
out of my mind sitting in here.
And they know it.
No one believed that I had
nothing to do with the car.
That man threatened me, and that
man did nothing to help me.
I told them
what they wanted to hear.
Now I've decided
I'm not gonna say anything else.
So you either charge me or you
let me out of here right now.
Sergeant Steele, I want you
to conclude this interview
and see me in my office.
I'm concluding this interview.
Is there anything else
you wish to say?
I've don't nothing wrong,
and I have a great deal
to say about it,
but not here and not to you.
You fucking dog.
We both know what you've done.
You've got no hope on going back
on what you said.
You're gone.
You just wanted me to share it
so badly, didn't you?
It's a good story
while it lasted.
I'm no killer,
you stupid bastard.
Fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fucking lying
bloody arsehole!
Fucking bastard lying
fucking bastard!
- What?
- Turn around.
I've just got one word for you.
- Yeah? What?
- Toecutters.
Are they on me now?
Yep.
What have you done?
Nothing.
He's a smartarse,
and he somersaulted us.
What have you got?
We can tie him to the car.
We've got enough to charge him
with theft of the car.
We can put him in the vicinity
where the person went missing.
We've got a witness
who can identify him.
We've got expert evidence
of it being in his handwriting
on the transfer document
and Mrs. Beecroft's letter.
I've got three fingerprints
on the transfer document,
and we've also got
his own admission.
Sir, if you heard the tapes,
you would believe him.
If we had the body, we could
charge him with murder now.
You heard him make
an official complaint
over threats
in that interview room.
If those complaints are proven,
then any admission he did make
would be inadmissible,
and I'll have
your fucking balls, mate.
Admissions? You want admissions?
They're as fucking long
as your arm.
He was just about to get back
into it till you barged in.
It's our word against his.
It's as simple as that.
I am going to get a statement
of formal complaint
from Mr. Fleming.
You can put together
a brief of evidence
relating to the theft
of a motorcar.
If I think you've got
enough evidence,
he can be summoned for
that offense at a later date.
Yes, sir.
But what about the murders?
What other avenues
have you got going?
Stawell Police and CIB
is searching for the location
that Fleming drew
as well as any other location
that resembles the description
that he gave.
That's it?
If he somersaulted you, that's
likely to be bullshit too.
Sir, this man
is a serial killer.
Mate, I am on your side.
But any further decisions
are gonna be made upstairs.
And unfortunately,
I assure you, as things are,
they are gonna be harder
to convince than me.
Well, I want to come with you.
That won't be necessary.
They're gonna let him walk.
Just goes to show you
how the mind works, doesn't it?
I don't know, Mr. Fleming.
How does the mind work?
Mm.
I've listened to a lot
of people talk about killing,
and I've often wondered
what it must feel like.
Nothing.
There's nothing to it.
Well, there must be.
You know, to... to have
that power over another person.
Look at him.
He gets off on it.
Sir, we don't have to show them
our tapes.
Most of these conversations
happened
when their audio tapes were off.
Their tapes are clean.
It's only ours that have
a record of this.
That's the ethics committee's
decision, not ours.
And I can't see them withholding
the tapes from the DPP,
the ombudsman,
or his defense counsel.
What did you mean
by blueprint?
His favorite porno mag
and movie... that sort of thing.
Why pornography?
Well, if it's not that, it's
something equally as tasteful.
The trouble with crooks
is they've got no imagination.
There are only three ways
to learn to do
the kind of shit
that we have to clean up.
Either someone done it to you,
you read about it,
or you've seen it on some video.
Now, this story
on Maria Garabaldi
was published on the 7th.
We fed it to the media
on the 6th,
and she was reported missing
on the 3rd.
On the 3rd.
That bastard!
Bloody country editions.
Where are those fucking dates?
You idiot!
Haven't you matched the dates
people went missing
with the actual paper?
Yes, but I didn't know I was
looking for country editions!
This was your responsibility
to brief him properly.
All right, everybody.
Heads up.
Gordon, Pitney, Johnson,
come over here.
Lend a hand, please.
Right.
Here's a list of the dates
all our people went missing.
Check the dates
with the newspaper.
If it's not a country edition,
check the dates on the papers
up to four days previous.
Roger Lee was reported missing
on the 22nd of June.
Here, sir.
It's a city edition.
Here's the 21st country edition.
I bet we can match a country
edition to every disappearance.
Bloody beautiful.
At least Jackson
can't turn him loose now.
Should be enough to save
his ass, get him a bit of glory.
Next time,
start with the bit that matters.
Yeah?
I've got to beef this up a bit,
so I'll need your support.
You can count on me.
Sir, we've got him.
It's circumstantial,
but it's good circumstantial.
It's too fucking late.
He's bloody gone?
We can put him in the bush every
day our people went missing.
Shut up.
It's what we needed, sir.
Shut up.
Would you mind waiting
in the office?
Toecutters.
They've had you
under video surveillance
since you walked into that room
this morning.
You're fucking joking. Why?
From what they say, your whole
interview is inadmissible.
I'd have thought you'd known
better than that,
especially in a case like this.
We haven't touched a hair
on his head.
Nobody has laid a finger on him.
And if they've been videoing,
they'll know it.
They say you've used threats,
intimidation, and inducement.
We didn't touch the bastard.
Did you know
they were taping us?
No, and I don't like it
any better than you do.
- Unbelievable.
- So where do you stand?
And what's happening here?
Fleming walks.
But the shadow is in tow.
You are to brief
Sergeant Quinlan's crew.
She will be taking over
the Fleming investigation.
You arsehole.
You've rigged us upstairs,
haven't you?
I'm brought in here
to get results,
to make you look good
on an investigation
that's gone nowhere.
All you do is tie me hands.
You lie. You cheat.
You leak information.
You're a fucking disgrace.
You're supposed to be one of us.
You make me sick.
You want your name
in the newspapers?
How about
"Police release serial killer,"
with your name all over it?
I'm aware that you have
counseled Prior
about his behavior
in the interview room.
And I will stand up for you.
But don't threaten me.
Oh, fuck you.
I'm not gonna cop this
holier-than-thou shit from you.
I've gone from being the
Lord Mayor to the shit carter
in about two hours.
Watch out Fleming doesn't come
and cut your throat.
I'm sure that we're in.
I have to advise you we have
been videotaping you all day
under instructions
from the ethics committee.
From my observations,
you have a disregard of the law
and a total disregard
of the judge's rules.
I'm instructing you
that I will be formally
interviewing both of you
in relation to these matters.
Do you intend interviewing us
about criminal
or departmental matters?
Possibly both.
I don't believe this.
You have any idea
of what you're doing?
I thought I could ask you
the same question.
You're in enough trouble
without adding insubordination
to the list.
If you'd been watching all day,
you'd know he's knocked
at least five or six.
Those matters will be dealt with
by other police.
It's not our concern.
Well, it should be, because it
means he'll do it again
as sure as you're sitting there.
What we've done, sir,
is to gather enough evidence
to take
one of the most dangerous men
I've ever interviewed
off the street.
It's been a very difficult
investigation.
And with someone as plausible
and as devious as this man,
the interview is crucial.
As far as I'm concerned,
we've conducted it within
the specifications of the law.
And as far as I'm concerned,
we don't break the law
to enforce it.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
If you can't see what's wrong
with putting this man
back on the street,
you're fucked in the head,
and I hope it comes
to visit you.
Shouldn't take you long
to brief the other team.
I'll be waiting.
I was genuinely frightened.
They weren't in the least bit
interested in what I had to say.
At what point did you become
frightened?
Well, from the moment they broke
down my door and hit me.
I see.
And they humiliated me
by making me strip.
I don't know how many
times I asked for food.
It's the sort of thing you
r-read about in the newspapers
all the time, but they're always
supposed to be crooks.
So you... you just
don't think about it.
Are you saying that there's
no truth to the admissions
regarding Mr. Beecroft
and others?
I didn't say anything
that they didn't lead me to.
You gave a lot of specific
details, Mr. Fleming.
And you volunteered them.
Look. I made it up.
I'm sorry.
I know it was stupid.
I just got so bloody angry.
Have a look at this.
Yeah, right.
He's done these six for sure.
Where are you?
Well, I've got something
for you,
and it's very bloody tropical.
No. Now.
Right now.
What's he like?
Any history?
Nothing.
Thinks he's smarter and
more clever than anyone else.
- Any bodies?
- No.
He gets rid of them
in isolated areas...
So isolated we can't find them.
It's here.
I'm being fucked.
This is the bloke
they're letting go.
Is this the interview tape?
Yeah.
Christ.
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?
Mate, people don't go from
pinching cars at 15 years of age
to killing half a dozen people
26 years later
without a whole lot
of other shit in between.
Well, how much time
have you spent with him?
Enough to know he's a killer.
They'll have your badge
and gun, mate.
Mate, they think
they've already got them.
And I haven't started
with those blokes yet.
Alice Morewood.
Family from Cavendish.
Couple of kids still at school.
Her old man's
a bit of a redneck.
She was last seen shopping
in Horsham
on June the 12th last year.
She was driving a Toyota Corona.
There's been a lot of rumors
around town
that she nicked off
with another bloke.
It's bullshit.
Is he in the frame
for anything else?
The most revealing thing we've
got is his record of interview.
You listen to that,
and it'll curl your hair.
There goes your man.
Oh, he likes you.
Jackson will put him through
deprocessing.
After that, the shadows
are sitting off outside.
- They'll take him away.
- How many?
Two crews of four
around the clock.
Any connection between
the people he's targeted?
No. Nothing you can put
your finger on.
Just that he's got a taste
for ordinary, decent people.
We realize it's been
eight hours, Mr. Fleming.
We just need a few more details.
Am I being charged?
Not at this point in time.
Can I get my belongings back,
please?
Sergeant Steele, you are not
being cautioned at this stage.
However, the conversation
is being tape-recorded.
If you refuse or decline
to answer our questions,
you will be charged
with disobeying
a lawful instruction.
Apart from Mr. Fleming's,
we have signed complaints
from other people as well.
Well, I could get people
to sign things
I'd written up, too.
Yes.
We are aware of that.
I said I could, not I did.
It demonstrates a pattern to
the way you operate, Mr. Steele.
You permitted Prior to abuse,
assault, intimidate,
make false promises to,
and threaten Mr. Fleming.
All right.
Is that a question?
If it is, which part do you
want me to answer first?
Furthermore, it could be said
that you conspired with Prior
to pervert the course of justice
and set up an innocent man.
No comment.
Sergeant, I'm talking
about your conduct
as the senior officer
in the interview room
and the threats,
both physical and verbal,
that the two of you made.
Which part of the statement
are you referring to now?
I've got it all on videotape,
Mr. Steele.
Hell, maybe if you charge me,
I'll have the same civil rights
as a crook.
Look.
You can stop this.
Fleming doesn't have to be
released just yet.
Oh, yes, he does.
Because you were careless,
slipshod.
Fleming walks
because you're not good enough.
Without me, you wouldn't have
even got him into this room.
He knows who you are.
He's spent his whole life
using people like you.
The transcript
of Mr. Fleming's complaint
will be available shortly.
I'm interrupting this interview
until it is available.
Chase it up, will you, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
This is personal with you,
isn't it, George?
I mean, every time it's you.
Typical cowboy response.
You don't seem to realize
it's your own conduct
that brings down this avalanche
of complaints.
This is the fourth time
you've interviewed me
in the last three years,
and you've never succeeded
in even sticking
a disciplinary charge on me.
Have you ever thought that maybe
the way you see things
might be wrong?
Oh, you're a thug.
You get more complaints
than Ned Kelly.
You're gonna end up
back on the street,
no pension, no superannuation,
dishonorable discharge.
And it'll happen
because I'll make sure it does.
I know what's been going on
in the interview room.
I know what's going on
in your head.
When was the last time
you worked on the streets?
Do you have any idea
what it's like out there?
You fight fire with fire.
I charge them.
They complain about me.
And that's the problem,
Mr. Steele...
Too many complaints.
Oh, you're a thug.
You get more complaints
than Ned Kelly.
You're gonna end up
back on the street,
no pension, no superannuation,
dishonorable discharge.
And it'll happen
because I'll make sure it does.
Abuse, threats, and assault.
I should have asked for a meal.
I'm sure not all the police
are bad like this.
And I'm willing to accept it's
all been an unfortunate mistake.
But it's just so upsetting.
If this could happen to me,
you know,
it could happen to anybody.
Really, it's all just about
being reasonable, isn't it?
