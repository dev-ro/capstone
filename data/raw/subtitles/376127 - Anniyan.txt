Hail Lord Radha Govinda!
Sing along with them.
- Okay father.
O Lord Ganesha!
O Lord of beauty!
O Lord merciful!
Lakshmi, stop cleaning nose.
Sit properly.
lt's December, control your nerves.
- Control your nerves.
Oh Chari!
O Lord!
Did you take my pen?
Yes, l took it to settle our milk
account for this month.
Don't you know to keep things
back in the original place?
Look at the newspaper.
Can't you fold it after reading?
- Ask this to your father?
You're a big headache.
l hate disorder.
ls he planning to
go to Tiruvayaru?
He insists on singing in this year's
Saint Thiagaraja Aradhana.
Hearing him singing,
great musical legends will run away.
His voice will get unnoticed
in the crowd.
Passing comments on me?
Do you know who l am?
Poochi Srinivasa lyengar's heir.
As if Saint Thiagaraja will come back
to life listening to your song.
Ambi, are you coming?
To Tiruvayaru? No way.
l've a lot of consumer cases
to deal with.
Cases you take up will either be
a rotten one or an useless one.
No money.
Money is not important.
Good people must get justice.
l've handled many cases.
But now, Truth & Honesty
are bad words.
Ambi, l got this card yesterday.
Don't know what it is.
Your father told me to tear it.
Anniyan is born!
Tell your sorrows to him.
Like in 'Garudapuranam',
sinners will be punished.
Take 15 copies of this letter
and mail it to 15 people.
Anniyan will shower
his blessing on you.
Kadayanallur Ramaswamy
who failed to do so, died.
What do you mean by that?
- Some crank.
But anyway, l'll write it.
Stop...- What?
Why did you spit on me?
There is a temple that side.
So l spat this side & unfortunately
you came in between.
You could've either spat in
a corner or in the garbage.
Or you could even spat into
a plastic cover, staple it,
and throw into a garbage,
making this city germ free.
l'll rather spit in my wallet.
Spitting on road is wrong.
Would you do this
inside your home?
What can l do if it comes
out of my mouth? Wipe it & go.
You're wasting my time.
Can't you at least say sorry?
To hell with your bloody sorry!
There is no courtesy.
Automan, you've crossed
the yellow line.
Shouldn't the vehicle coming in
the opposite side need space to go?
Look few others
are following you.
Excuse me, you're all educated.
How can you break traffic rules?
lf everyone starts to
occupy the space,
there will be huge traffic jam
and finally a grid lock.
lt's getting late to office.
lf l go late, it's loss of pay.
Will you compensate that?
You know it's a peak hour.
Why don't you start early?
You come in line. lt'll become dusk.
Go back home
Who is this idiot!
Lecturing me early morning.
Neither he goes nor
let's others to go.
Very strange people!
My break wire is snapped.
No brake in my vehicle.
No brakes.
My brake wire is snapped.
Move away.
No brakes. My brake wire
is snapped. Move away.
Pallavan Driver, don't cross
the yellow line.
Hey priest! lf you talk rules,
this will be the result.
Hey...
l'm a lawyer not a priest.
What brake wire is this!
Changed just a week before.
You gave a year's guarantee.
lt got snapped amidst heavy traffic.
l could've been run over
by any bus & dead.
Bring me the brake wire & the bill.
l'll send it to the factory.
lf you get a replacement, take it.
Will you find a replacement
if l had died?
You're not dead.
So, what's your problem?
Don't you care for the consumers?
You only worry about profits,
and not about the danger
your inferior products create.
We're only dealers. We buy & sell.
Fight with the factory owner.
l'm a lawyer.
l won't leave this.
Give me the factory
owner's name & address.
l'll file a case in the consumer court,
claim the damages caused
and get the company shut down.
Do as you please.
Give me a brake wire of TVS 50.
Sir, don't buy it from this shop.
All sub standard cables.
The lSl seal is duplicate.
There is no quality.
Nobody sells quality products.
That is the reason why lndian products
have no global presence.
Stop lecturing. Don't spoil
my business. Get lost man.
Hello, come in a line.
We're just 2 of us.
Let it be 2 or 2000, you must come
in the line. First come first serve.
People get down from entrance door
and board from exit door.
Why're you in a hurry?
One ticket to High Court.
Travelling on foot board
is dangerous. Come inside.
Not used to it.
Excuse me, will you get me
a ticket to Medical college?
Not just a ticket,
l'll buy you a bucket.
Hey move...
Ambi...sit here.
Me...?- Come on sit.
lt's a ladies seat. Men shouldn't sit there.
Get up when ladies come.
Now sit.
He is very cute.
Let's take a snap.

ls love a burden?
ls it a never ending pregnancy?
lf l hide my love,

Will you please get up?
Excuse me. What are you doing?
Standing behind this girl
and misbehaving with her.
Stay away.
What did l do?
Didn't you put your hand
on her waist?
Ambi please.
lt's embarrassing.
No Nandini.
We should leave these guys.
Hello sir. Why are you so quiet?
Won't you question him?
People travel by bus to
rub against women.
Who is that?- lt's him.
Stop it. When driver puts the brake,
we tend to rub against someone.
Hey you...! Taking me to task?
l'll smash you.
How dare you hit me!
Nandini, didn't he misbehave
with you or not?
Tell us.
- Don't hit him
lt's wrong. Don't take law
into your hands.
Take the bus to
the police station.
Sign here.
You'll get a summon
within 10 days.
lf you give a testimony in the
Egmore magistrate court,
he'll either be taken into
custody or will be fined.
You can go. l'll take care.
- Thank you sir.
Go.
l've not come to the police station
for my personal issues?
Don't hit him. lt's wrong.
Police has no right
to beat a criminal.
Take him to custody & produce
him in the magistrate court.
Don't over do your job.
Then, why did you bring
him to police station?
lnstead, you could've taken
him to a temple.
This is an unwanted statement
irrelevant to the current situation.
According to rule...
Oh my god! Enough. Go.
lnform me if he beats you.
l'll take care.
Come.- Take your hands off sir.
Didn't you listen to him?
My lawyer has told you
not to beat me.
Get me Biriyani for lunch.
Nandini, now you can go.
Shit!
By handing him over to the police,
you've done a great job.
There are many buses in our state.
Men do rub against women.
What are you going
to do with them?
Everyone must be punished.
Try to be practical, Ambi.
This is the price to be paid
by urban & middle class families.
We're used to such brushing.
Nandini, how could you also...?
lf l start feeling shy for all these,
l must go to college in an incubator.
Because of you, so many
are late to their office.
l missed my class.
They'll reduce my internal marks.
Get lost Ambi.
Who is going to appear
for the next case?
Ramanujam sir.
Which Ramanujam?
- Rules Ramanujam.
What is your plea? Make it short.
He's Mr. Ponnambalam.
He owns 10 houses in Chennai.
He built 20 small portions in each building,
and charges exorbitant rent.
My client Jayalakshmi lives
in his building in Vadapalani.
lt's only 300 sq.ft.,
By rent control norms,
he must take only Rs. 600.
But he charges Rs. 2000.
Now he has raised Rs. 100.
One unit of power costs Rs. 1 .50.
But he charges Rs. 4.50.
Poor people.
Most of her family earns,
goes paying the rent.
They run family from the leftovers,
leading a very ordinary life.
l came up in life from
very humble beginnings.
l didn't want people
to suffer like me.
So, l built many portions
collecting very low rent.
l'm doing it as a social service.
l've not breached any
rent control norms.
Do you have any proof
to prove his crime?
There is no receipt.
He gives only a small paper.
Without a printed bill or a revenue
stamp or his signature,
How can you consider this
small paper as evidence?
They could've brought that piece
of paper & filled the amount.
ln Tamilnadu, no one gives a
proper receipt for rent collected.
Only a small bit paper.
This can't be considered.
Case dismissed.
Who is next? - Manivannan.
Hey Rules! Didn't l tell you in the
beginning that you'll lose?
l offered you Rs. 2000.
You could've joined hands with me.
You don't know how
to come up in life.
What happened now?
l had to pay Rs. 50000.
But never mind.
l'll increase the rent.
Please don't do that, sir.
Not for you madam.
lt's for the others.
You pack your things
and leave the house.
He'll neither charge rent nor fees.
Bye Rules!
You're a blood sucking shark.
l should kill him else
we should commit suicide.
Don't talk like that,
we'll go to the High Court.
l don't have that power.
Leave it!
We'll fight till we can,
if not, commit suicide.
What happened?
Old man met with an accident.
O Lord!...
Couldn't you've come carefully?
Don't touch! This is accident case.
Let police come.
Should we watch till then?
What is this?
Lost blood heavily.
Any doctor is here?
Sir, anyone of you go and call doctor!
Anyone of you call an ambulance!
Anyone of you go
and get a Soda!
Why're you telling others?
You go sir.
Look, how he's escaping from here!
He's dying.- Please take care him.
Auto....
- Can't you see the passenger inside?
Hello... sir... please sir...
one old man is injured....
Please sir... stop the vehicle...
Sir...please sir...
Stop the car....- Hey move man!
Old man is injured.... please save him...
Please sir... Thank you sir!
Sir, stop here. Thank you sir...
Why did you stopped my car?
An old man is injured
and struggling for his life.
Please sir, drop him at hospital.
Hey, Close the door.... Close it...
This is newly registered car
out on road first time.
You're telling me carry
a dead body first in this.
Oh god! Not a dead body!
He's alive sir.
l insisted on white car
and white seat,
lf seat gets blood stained,
who will clean this?
ls seat more important
to you than life!
l'll clean it.
Please, help me sir.
Life comes and goes in seconds.
Can we get a car?
l had promised to take
my family to a temple.
You're calling me to mortuary.
Helping a man in distress,
is like going to temple!
Am l only the person
to help you? Bloody ldiot!
Sir... No one is stopping the car...
- Hey, move away.
Sir, it's getting late.
He's dying.
Sir, please help him...sir...
Shit! Go & bring him.
l'll come.
Come sir...
- Nothing short in courtesy.
Thank you sir.
Thank god, people like you
are there to help others.
Please move... move...
Be careful..
Sir... sir..
Sir...
Give me soda.
Can l make a call for an Ambulance?
- Okay do it.
Doctor, please attend that first.
He's on the verge of death.
Everyone is dying.
How many cases should l've to attend?
Do l have more than two hands?
Bloody drunkards of spurious liquor...
...with Methanol.
They'll lose eye sight.
VOA!
Go and call the Constable.
What happened?
- He's dead.
l could've saved if you'd brought
him 30 minutes earlier.
You seem to be educated.
Why did you delay
to bring him here?
lrresponsible man!
Oh! Lord!
My people are irresponsible!
No one is honest!
No one is responsible!
No one is humane!
Hey! What happened?
No one is following the rules, father.
Have you started again?
Spitting on roads...
breaking traffic rules...
Selling third rate cables...
Women are disrespected in buses...
Taking exorbitant rents...
A man is dying on the road...
...hundreds of cars are flying past...
..not one stopped...
...one car stopped...
...he too sped away fearing
blood stains on his car seat.
That man's life could've
been saved...
...if we had reached hospital
30 minutes earlier.
lt would've given me satisfaction.
He died!
Sinners! They'll all go to hell!
From dawn to dusk,
whatever is happening
around is wrong.
Ambi! You can't change
the world alone!
Become a part of the world!
l may not be able to change...
but l can shed tears for it, can't l?
ls it wrong to expect little
humanity from people?
Why is god not punishing
these people?
Moon is bright even in the
homes of untouchables.
He would've made an arrangement.
Bad time has reached its peak.
They'll get punished...they will!
l don't feel like that.
You don't weep...
you'll get an headache.
Susi, give him a hot coffee.
Take a tablet, pray to lord
and go to sleep.
Good night!
Lord!
On the way to the hell...
...this is the last sanctuary for the
people waiting to reach hell...
...this rain mesh!
People sans humanity!
People without honesty!
Law breakers!
People who cheat government!
People who cheat public!
Lazy people who never work!
These people can never
escape from Anniyan!
Lodge your complaint
with Anniyan.
No one in this world has mercy...
...refuse to follow
any established rules...
For example?
Six examples in one day!
What are they?
A man died because
speeding cars didn't stop!
Don't worry!
Every one will be punished
according to 'Garuda Puranam'.
Who are you?
Why did you bring me here?
Why didn't you stop the car?
- What?...When?
Yesterday a man was dying
on the road after an accident.
Don't you remember?
Yes...near the Teynampet signal!
Why didn't you stop?
l had an urgent work.
l didn't have breakfast too!
lf it had been your father
or mother or a friend,
would you've gone
without stopping there?
Definitely l would've stopped.
Why don't you have the same
feeling for a stranger?
ls it any grievious crime?
- Yes! You fat pig!
Your irresponsibility has cost
a man to lose his life.
There's no rule to stop my car.
Would you have humanity and
mercy only if it's made a law?
That's why you are insensitive to
other people's pain & death.
My law will punish these crimes.
Death sentence!
Death sentence for
not stopping the car?!
Does my judgement
appear strange to you?
That's me!
Lord!
Save me!
Save me!
Save me!
Save me!
Save me!
Save me!
Save me!
Move...move.- What happened?
Why police are swarming the area?
Go man! - Any Vijaykanth film
shoot is going on?
A man is killed...go man!
Association president is here!
Sir...?!
Sorry sir!
Hands down!
Take me inside as if to inquire!
Okay sir.
Are you a local? - Yes sir.
Name? - Alai.
You? - Thambudi.
l've to inquire you, come in.
How many times l've to tell you
not to salute me in public?
Just dressing up like
a policeman,
and coming in a Gypsy car,
won't the criminal get alerted?
Fool! How will the general
public co-operate with us?
They'll go far away
and shout at us...
Sorry!
Sir, DGP is here!
Come in sir.
He has chased him with
hordes of buffaloes.
Why did he push him
into this den is unknown?
Buffaloes ran helter skelter
all the night in fear.
Quarry people heard the cries in
the morning and took them out.
They saw the body and
intimated the police.
Where is the body?
- ln the car.
Body is mangled
like mashed potato.
l haven't seen a murder
like this in my service.
How long will you say
the same dialogue?
Sorry sir.
A good feast to me as a policeman.
Eat this?
Killer is not an ordinary man.
His intention is also not ordinary.
How can you say that?
He could've stabbed
him with a knife.
He could've run over him
with this car.
Why did he bring him here to
get trampled by buffaloes?
l know sir.
We can't arrest buffaloes.
Sorry sir.
Analyze it seriously!
He killed him here not
to leave any trace of evidence.
Why did he put the
body in the car?
To confuse us.
- Why to confuse us?
To make us work at least
for the salary we take.
Sorry sir.
'AKUNPADAM'
He's a dangerous man!
We have to catch him quickly.
Or else l feel this will continue.
You've come to the station
any time we may call you.
Yes sir.
Hey! You too! - Yes sir.
What do you think the
word 'AKUNPADAM' mean?
l've heard many words like
a game, sugar mix for sweet...
What the hell is this word?
May be a Northern sweet's name?
Always after food!
l feel this is not a Tamil word.
Then it's sure to be the opening
word of a Tamil film song.
...Akunpadam...love is cool...
love is happiness...
Sorry sir.
l feel it's a jumbled word.
Jumbled? What's that?
lt's six letter word.
lf we make combinations
like 6x5x4x3x2x1 ...
We'll get 720 combinations
like these...
Boss! You're genius!
This is not a murder...
lt's a statement.
He's sending a message
to this world.
Ambi! Are you coming
to Tiruvayaru or not?
All our people are going there.
No father, l've got to do lot of
groundwork for the brake wire case.
Oh god!
What's there inside?
- Nothing!
lf there's nothing,
why are sitting over it? Move.
Personal.
- What personal?
Crime branch's work is to check
other's personal things. Move...
No Chari!- Oh god!
Nandhini!
Withered rose...
peacock feather...
Hook...clip...rubber band...
...with few strands of hair...
Hairpin!
Under the holy symbol...a gift shop!
No please...
Wait...let me see it.
- No please.
You've stuffed a post office
in your box!
Dear Nandhini...
my love Nandhini...
Deepavali greetings!
Pongal greetings!
New year greetings!
Birthday greetings!
2003!
2000!
1997 is also there.
Didn't you dare to give
her even one card also?
lt isn't wrong to give her
as a friend or brother.
lsn't it wrong to give
with love in heart?
Why did you buy these cards then?
l have to give...
but l'm unable to give.
Wait!
No Chari.
- What's this?
Wait!
Chant of Lord Rama!
Why?
Nandhini is weak in Chemistry...
for her good marks!
ln what other things she's weak?
Did you express it to her?
Express or fail to express,
either way it's wrong.
l'm in docks!
How long?
Seven years!
Bloody! Love is,
when it is expressed.
At least gave her
any hint of it? - No!
Give me a wink!
Great show!
Not like that...
...wink is like this
when you see girls...Wink now!
Not both the eyes!
Close one eye cutely!
What's that? Kumarimuthu will
do better than you.
You're very innocent!
Simpleton! - No need of it.
Okay, leave it on me,
l'll take care of everything.
Come to Tiruvayaru with us.
- No, l'm not coming.
Nandhini is also coming,
you know that?
l'll come.
They'll send telegram on reaching,
she's talking about letter.
Move...blocking the way.
lf you take what should be going
in a goods train as passenger,
why will it not derail
from the tracks?
Can you come in the next train?
When l chew tobacco,
l've to spit out!
l too chew tobacco,
give me some!
l chew tobacco mixed
with marijuana!
Marijuana?!
Ambi, come here quickly.
Not here...this side.
Talk to her.
Nandhini! Have you renewed
your bus pass?
Spitting is a bad habit!
To spit or not is in your hands now.
Talk to her bravely!
This is first time for me.
Tell me about Tiruvayaru.
Thiagaraja Aradhana on the
fifth day is the highlight.
At the mausoleum of the Saint
on the bank of river Cauvery...
...on the sand of the river bank..
Musicians from all over the world
who have converged there...
...sitting with great devotion...
Will they eat tamarind rice?
Fool! Don't talk nonsense.
When they all sing together Saint's
composition 'Pancharatna Krithis'.
You'll be out of this world
and feel like in heaven.
Who is that?
- Started it!
Will you play all the night?
- Oh My percussion is missing.
Someone may have taken to fill water.
Don't you've a 'Ganjira'? Play with it.
Shut up boy!
Look, he's playing here.
lf it was smaller l would've
used it as a pillow.
What's your instrument?
- Chant!
What?
lf you do like that anyone
may stuff a banana,
into your mouth feeling
you're hungry.
Please sit down, Chari.
What happened?
Sorry Uncle, l thought it
was my thigh.
Nandhini, you sing very well.
She wants to perform at Music academy
in the music season.
She tried very hard but no use.
Everything needs recommendation.
Do you know anyone there?
lf l knew l would've
performed there myself.
l would've run away!
Don't eat Nandhini!
TTR!
No one should eat the food.
ls it food?
Very bad rice.
This is very salty.
Potato is not boiled.
Turmeric water in the name of Sambar.
Cow's urine in the name of Rasam.
Useless buttermilk!
Pickle floating in curd!
What's this?
ls it papad or kerchief?
Any problem?
He's not satisfied with the meals.
You're checking our tickets,
won't you check these things?
Will you eat this food?
l get my food from home.
l'll cook and bring my food.
Will you eat this food?
l'm hungry, Ambi.
- Don't touch!
You're charging Rs. 25 for a meal.
Don't you've the least courtesy
to supply food worth of it?
ls this food worth at least Rs. 5?
Don't ask me sir,
l'm just a supplier.
Who is the contractor?
He's in Villupuram,
name is Chockalingam.
TTR! l must meet this Chockalingam
on reaching Villupuarm.
Train will not go further
without solving this problem.
l'm terribly hungry, Ambi.
- Don't rush to eat.
l'll get you good food at
Villupuram fighting with them.
When will this train
reach Villupuram?
At 1 am. - Great!
Shall l take your food and deliver
it to the next compartment?
Don't take away.
-Take...we don't want your food.
All are eating the same food.
All are risking their lives.
Two days of this food will give us
Amoebiosis, ulcer and liver problem.
They would be minting money.
Take it.
Aunt loves food,
you spoiled a chance.
Shut up! He's always like that.
You don't worry, l've some bananas.
- Come on, have it.
l told you many times not
to buy without the stalk.
With flies on it,
it'll will spread infections.
Shut up! - Take it.
At least cut the corner
and give her.
You're creating trouble like
Goundamani with a banana.
Come with me,
l've to talk to you.
She'll not accept you as a brother
also if you behave like this.
Don't talk like that,
l can't take it.
You must express your love
before we reach Thanjavur.
Don't hesitate, say it forthrightly.
How...?! Where..?!
She'll go to the toilet
before going to the bed.
Catch her near the wash basin.
lf it is possible kiss her.
- Me?!
Can l call Kamalhasan to kiss her?
You've to kiss her.
No way! Never defile her.
Go...go and try to impress her.
lf l had got such a chance,
l would've booked a coupe,
have her and get down
at Kumbakonam with a child.
Excuse me!
What has brought you here?
To renew my bus pass.
Oh! Using the toilet!
Just wait!
Sorry!
Yuck!
TTR!
Pain in the neck!
Don't go inside.
What's the problem?
Toilet is not clean, it's stinking.
How else would a
railway toilet will be?
Hundreds of passengers use it.
ls it your personal toilet?
Shouldn't you keep it one like that?
Aren't you taking money from the
passengers for the amenities?
Aren't you charging for the
toilets also in the ticket?
l'll get it cleaned in the next station.
till then bear it.
You've no rights to ask people
to control their nature calls.
l'll just wash my face and...
- You don't know, Nandhini.
lf you use unclean seat or enter toilet,
you'll get all types of infections.
A child has defiled here.
No water too.
Rust marks all over the place.
Door, latch, or tap
everything is disgusting.
How the hell do you run the Railways?
l must write to the authorities.
Do it immediately.
This is with the stalk.
Did you tell her?
- l told her.
l told her the toilet is
defiled and unclean.
Why don't you clean it with disinfectant?
- Okay.
l told you express your love and
you'd a debate about cleanliness.
Come now!
l'm feeling sleepy,
let's go to sleep.
Glamour Aunt! Stay here.
Jumbo Aunt! Shift to the
double berth other side.
Chanting Uncle! You snore too much.
Shift to the berth number 72
in the next compartment.
Ambi! You there!
Nandhini! You here!
Move boy!
Bungle...sorry Uncle, stay put here.
Enough of your bungling!
Now, it's night!
Running train.
Opposite berths.
Lovers will not get a
better chance than this one.
l'll get up at midnight.
l must find you both sleeping
together in one berth.
Gas trouble?
Called me?
l'm a 'Kalaimamani' awardee!
Shouldn't l sing?
l'm trying for a great pimp award.
You'll not understand it.
Shut up and go to sleep.
TTR!
l thought she'll shout
but he's shouting!
What's your problem now?
Fan is not running.
Move it with your finger, it'll run.
Are we paying to make
it run with our finger?
There are 1 400 passengers in this train.
Not one has complained, except you.
Can't you adjust and travel?
Country has come to this condition
with these adjustments.
What do you want me to do?
Railways is a large network.
15.8 lakh people are
employed all over lndia.
lt's very difficult to find
who is responsible for this.
Even if we find he'll push
it on someone else.
Or he'll promise to get the
concerned person look into it.
Or else he'll say sorry
promising not to repeat it.
Will you spend your precious
time pursuing this matter?
Get him off this train.
You missed out golden opportunity.
You're the biggest bungling guy!
You deserve to get lynched
by hired goons.
You can never get a girl friend.
Your parents have to
choose & find a girl for you.
l am just unable to tell.
- Then, l'll tell her.
Nandhini, Ambi lo...
Ambi lo...?
Didn't get you.
No...Ambi love....
What's the matter?
What's it Chari?
Ambi loves you.
Oh God? What's this?
- Love?
What's all this?
- Oh My Lord!
Mistake aunt.
- When did it happen?
Shut up, l've great regard
for you aunt.
He told that in English,
please don't mistake me.
What are you watching there?
Turn this side and sit.
Are you spoiling my reputation
in the name of help?
Love is like nature's call,
it's dangerous to hold it for long.
l'll tell her before going
back from here, okay?
Promise? - Promise.
Love letter?
Can l come there?
- No need.
Watch out!
Write something romantic!
Don't write the chant
of Lord Rama again.
l know.
Why are you drawing margins?
Are you taking public
service examinations?
Your expression shows you'll
take additional sheets also.
Whatever it is show me once
after finishing the letter.
Don't worry,
l'll never make a mistake.
Gone!
Please stop for a second.
- What's it Ambi?
Be blessed!
Take it aunty.
l told him to give it to her daughter
but he's giving to her mother.
What's this?
- Love letter!
What's all this Ambi?
- lt's for Nandhini, uncle.
For Nandhini? Who gave it?
lt's from me, uncle.
You're confusing me.
A love letter...to her parents!
lt's not culture to talk
directly to the girl.
Writing love letter is not culture.
lt's always good to give
it to her parents.
Great boy!
lf you feel l've done good,
give it to Nandhini.
lf you feel l've done wrong,
tear and throw it.
So sweet!
We'll definitely give
it to Nandhini.
Your parents have brought
you up traditionally.
You've imbibed our culture
and tradition very well.
lnfact we are lucky to have
you as our son-in-law.

Not a crime at all.

lf fifty million people steal
five paise fifty million times...?
lt's a great crime.
That's what is happening here.
How many million passengers

He is sincere...but...
Do you have a pen?

only face to face!
Nandini, l'll take care of you well.
Oh God! l respect you, Ambi.
That is different.
What is love?
ls it a requisition form to accept?
Will it blossom with a request?
Or is it a charity to give,
just like that?
lt should blossom naturally.
But don't know why....
l don't love you.
Tell me the reason for that...
Why means?
l don't love you...that's it.
Despite l'm a good man,
why don't you love me?
Nandini, tell me the
correct reason for it.
How is it possible?
You're strictler of rules.
You're troublesome for everything.
You're like tables...
You're a clark's-table... Logarithm.
You're a Time-table....
lndex... Calculator...
You're a complaint box!
You're ridiculous.
How can a girl love you?
Thanks Nandini.
Time is up.
Oh brother! Have you passed away?
You used to prepare and

Your brother has been fried

You haven't shed tears!
Are Police men stone hearted?

With sorrow,

My anger shouldn't get subsided.
My anger shouldn't get cooled.

The day l find that bast... l'll...
l'll hold him tightly and l'll....
Only then l'll cry!
How many more are there?
Still we've 50 more pots...
What's all this?

Hello...
Hello!

R-E-M-O... - Remo?!
- That's right baby!
Have you received roses?
Who are you?
Why did you send them to me?
They are all roses of my garden.
They feel proud
they're very beautiful.
Once if they see you,
their pride will go kaput!.
Just see them once.
ln jealousy,
they may even commit suicide.
Bet?
Did you see the parrots,
sparrows and nightingales?
They're all very proud of
their sweet voice.
lf they hear you sing...
or even hear your voice...
they will stop blowing
their own trumpet.
That's why l've sent them to you.
Similarly, you think that
you'll never fall for any man.
Once if you see me,
you'll change your thought.
You want to see me, right?
Then come to the fashion show
in Park Sheraton today evening.
Hey one more thing...
lf you are weak hearted...
please don't come there...
No worries... Bye...

Hey Nandhi...
Good morning sir....
- Good morning.
Mr. Gopal, have you delivered
the goods to Bombay?- Yes sir.
Lawyer, which case is top story now?
A Brahmin lawyer has a case against
our cheap quality brake wires.
Final hearing is on Friday.
- ls it against us? - Yes sir.
He has claimed heavy damages.
lf he wins, we may have
to close down our factory.
Hey, what are you talking man?
Talking nonsense!
This Factory is worth crores....
Who is he?
Ramanujam! - What?
Rules Ramanujam!
ls this the time to tell this?
We tried to settle with him...
but he is very strong!
- What if he is strong?
Break him into pieces and
deliver it to the market!
Hello...
Hey, run away.... run away...
Everything is gone!
What are you doing there?
l told the moon that l saw
a brighter girl than you.
l told stars that a lass's smile
is more beautiful than you.
They asked me to show you.
So l bought them here.
Hey, did you see that?
Moon hid in shy seeing you.
There is a voltage drop
in the sky because of you!
Why did you come here? Go.
Okay. Confirm that you love me.
l'll go away.
No way! Go to hell!
Hey, Nandhi...
Why are you troubling me?
Not at all. l'm lying down.
lnstead of pillows, you hug me.
Will you go?
Or shall l call my parents?
Oh sure! Let's ask justice.
Father...
Mother...
Hey, why are you whispering?
Father.... Mother.... - Oh god!
Please leave this place.
Confirmation please.
What are you thinking?
Father... - Oh no!
Confirmed!
Wow! Great!
Acknowledgement.
Why?
You have confirmed
your love, haven't you?
Kiss me as an acknowledgement.
Oh God!
Hey, am l a Pope?!
Kissing my hand!
Lip to lip!
Go...
Set right the roof and go!
Good night, Nandhi.
Sweet dreams!
Aunty...
What do you want?
l want to talk to you.
Then why are you calling aunty?
l want to seek her permission.
Oh god! Ambi, why are you
behaving like this?
Tell me...
l couldn't take your rejection lightly.
l attempted suicide by
drowning myself in water.
Oh my god!
Suicide is against law.
So l dropped that idea.
Nandhini, tell me how
you like me to be?
l'll change myself.
- Why should you change?
l'm not able to forget you.
l can't die also.
Nandhini, l'm helpless!
Shall l remove my tuft?
Shall l wear jeans?
Wearing T- shirts and shoes,
shall l walk like Michael Jackson?
You can apply make-up
to humans.
But not to hearts!
Be yourself!
lf l remain like this,
you don't like me, right?
ln any form, l won't like you.
- Why?
l love another man.
Oh God! Oh No!
Hey, leave me...
Leave me... Why are you
carrying me like this?
You filed a case that 2 wheelers'
brake wires are faulty, didn't you?
Come let's go in an auto.
Leave me...
- Shall l leave you?
Oh no! Please don't leave me!
l'll fall!
Both of you maintain
the same distance.
Don't go wider...
Help... - Don't shout buddy!
- Hold me tightly...
Police...
They are kidnapping me.
Hey Raj, he is shouting...
Let us finish him quickly.
Please leave me! Oh god!
You scoundrels! Lamp Post!
Oh god!
Oh no!
Am l looking like a fighter?
You're beating me black and blue.
Oh god!
You stupid fellow!
That factory is worth crores of money...
lf your Rs. 10 brake wire snaps out,
Will you close down the factory?
Shouldn't they deliver
a quality brake wire?
You're repeating the same thing.
Beat him nicely.
They are beating me severely.
Oh god!
Will you dare to go
to the court again?
l can't beat you back.
l'm a vegetarian.
lt's paining me! Leave me!
Hey he is an earth worm. Leave him.
l feel bad he's not
attacking us back.
l haven't beat him properly
for my payment.
There should be a job satisfaction, right?
You're right. Leave him.
Oh god! Leave me...
l want to go home.
Close the sack!
Now beat him buddy!
Buddy, l think he is dead!
Hey Bloody bugger!
Hey did you call me?
- No buddy!
Hey scoundrel!
l'm calling only you!
Hey who raised the voice over here?
lt's me only!
Hey look here...
Ambi has turned up bravely!
Who is Ambi?
l'm not Ambi. He is lying down
after getting beaten up.
l'm Anniyan!
Hey Buddy, he is fishy...
He is confusing us.
Hey he might've gone mad
after getting beaten up!
Hey you bloody mugger!
How dare you beat
an innocent like this?
Beat me if you can!
He's confusing us.
He can't get up
even after a week....
lt's looking strange!
Hey Raj, is he that man?
l'm not him, but Lord of death.
This is the hymn of Samaveda.
This is the last hymn
heard before death.
Why don't you manufacture
quality products?
You're least bothered about
your customer's life, aren't you?
Starting from 25 paise betel-nut,
Tooth powder, face powder, clothes,
slippers, stove, tube lights, T.V., mixie...
starting from hairpin to escalator,
Not a product is
genuine in this country.
Don't you want our people
to use good quality products?
You sucked people's blood, didn't you?
Now...
They're going to suck your blood!
They are not food for you.
You will be their food!
Don't get scared.
Leeches have one advantage.
lt won't pain when sucks blood!
Oh Lord!
Tell me.
l filed a case against the manufacturer
of cheap break wire in consumer court.
Case is favourable to me.
Fear of losing the case, they beat me
severely with hired goons.
l want to file another
case against the owner.
Which factory?
Who is the Owner?
Raghavendra Ancillary unit, Ambattur.
Mr.Ethirajulu Naidu.
What is it? You're lodging
a complaint on dead man?!
ls he dead?
- Yes. Some one has killed him.
Killed him?
Oh god!
Hey, have they come
to remove the corpse?
They have come. - Call him here.
Hey, what are you doing?
lt's a very tough job.
We are removing
innumerable corpses daily.
We can work only
after having a peg.
Come fast. - We're coming...
That's it.
Put it down.
Your name?
- Nallan.- Sullan.
Bring down the corpse quickly.
Jayalakshmi, go...
Hello, all of you come down.
We never used this disguise.
But now we've done it.
Oh no! - Rascal!
What is this sir?
lt's been squeezed
like Egyptian Mummy.
Boss, ever heard about killing
a man with leeches?
No. This is the first time.
Killing with stampeding buffaloes,
getting fried in a frying pan...
First time.
He is killing people
in a new way.
Unable to understand his concept.
Sir, unable to identify
the reason behind it.
He can't escape from us!
lf he's caught,
he'll meet the same end.
Boss...
- What is it?
Hair!
- Hey...
What l meant was...
look at this long hair.
So, the killer is a woman!
Good. - Keep it safely.
Send it to the Lab for DNA test.
Boss, what are you searching?
He leaves a message, isn't he?
Yes...
Boss...
l've found it, boss.
'Munthiri Pakoda' is the name
he has given for this murder.
'Munthiri Pakoda' is available here.
100 gms costs Rs.4.50.
Sorry sir... this is some

goons to beat me.
You could've told me, right?
Did you complain to the Police?
- Yes.
Sir... - He is my friend.
His name is
Ayyanpuram Satiyanarayanan.
You might've heard of him.
He used to ask lots of questions
in T.V., Radio, magazines...
He used to ask complicated riddles.

Hello...

Thank you.
Good morning, uncle.
There is a 'Jumble word competition'

They will give the mixture of
innumerable words...
We've to pick up the right word.
l've tried so many times...
but l failed.
lt seems like Sanskrit words...
He asked me about a person
who knows Sanskrit.
You're a Sanskrit scholar, aren't you?
That's why l've bought him here.
lf l win this contest, they'll offer
a 'Samsung Colour T.V.'
You don't worry. l'll help you.
ANDHA GOOBAM
KUMBHl BHAGAM.
KlRUMl BHOJANAM.
Sanskrit words.
What's all this?
lt's all punishments' names given
to the sinners in the hell.
We have 28 types.
More than 84 lakhs...
lt's been explained in detail
in 'Garuda Puranam'.
What is the meaning of it?
Father, can you bring
'Garuda Puranam' for me?
l knew about it from
my grandmother.
Here it is.
ANDHA KUBAM means by pulling
down into the dark well,
torturing with animals.
This punishment is given to cheats,frauds,
murderers and disrespectful persons.
What is the meaning
of KUMBl BHAGAM?
lt's a well-known punishment.
Getting fried in a frying pan!
My god!
This is the punishment given to
selfish people who torture others.
What's the meaning
of 'MlRUGlNA JAMBO'?
No... 'KlRUMl BHOJANAM'.
This is a kind of slow death.
lt's killing people with leeches.
This is for inefficient manufacturers
who produce low quality products.
Punishments are stated for
all sorts of sins in this book.
VAJRA KANDAGAM, CHARA KARTHAMAM,
AASlPPATHRAM, LALA PAKSHAM.
There's a Judgement Day
in Christianity, isn't it?
Similarly, this is our religion's concept.
Mr. Ayyanpuram, is your doubt cleared?
Are you happy?
Thanks a lot.
Because of your help,
l'll get a Samsung Colour T.V.
See you then... - Bye Ambi.
Oh No! Don't stamp it...
lt's a leech...
How is it here?
Uncle, we went to
dig some ponds...
this leech might've
come with us...
l'll clear it now.
Don't know if it's coming or going...
We'll take a leave then.
See you... - Okay sir.
We'll take leave then.
You're leaving without
telling me anything...
Ambi isn't well, isn't it?
No problem aunty...
tell me.
We're planning to
perform Nandhini's marriage.
We've a piece of land in 'Tambaram'
to give her as dowry.
We've to register that land.
lf you verify the documents
and register this land.
lt will be a great help to us.
No problem aunty.
l'll do it tomorrow itself.
Mother, didn't you find
any other person?
Why?
He will start talking rules
in the Registrar's Office also.
So what? That will make us
give only little bribes.
He will accept whatever we
give as his fees. Get inside.
Come on...
l've arranged everything.
lt's enough if you bribe
him just Rs. 5000.
Rest of them can be
tackled by paying Rs. 1500.
Who are you? Why should we
give Rs. 5000 to the Registrar?
We'll go legally.
Please leave us.
Who is the owner?
Here they are...
Give me the original documents.
You have other documents, right?
- Yes sir.
Type as l tell you...
Nandhini, you have to buy stamp papers
for 80/0 of the ground value.
How much you paid for it?
8 lakhs.
8 lakhs? At Tambaram,
1 ground costs Rs. 12 lakhs, right?
lt won't be sufficient, Ambi.
You are right!
lf l register for 12 lakhs, l've to buy
stamp papers for Rs. 96000.
How is it possible?
l'm registering for Rs.8 lakhs only.
- Remaining 4 lakhs?!
Account 2...
Black money?!
Oh No! Don't shout!
lt's illegal to have black money.
Black money plays a vital role
for lndia's backwardness.
First include 4 lakhs
in the account,
Pay the income tax
amount Rs.1 ,34,640.
Pay the full amount
to them in cheque.
You have to buy stamp
papers for Rs.96000.
Oh god! He has started!
That's why l warned my mother....
Don't you know the reality?
Are all of them following
the same rules?
Sir, everyday we register
100's of documents in this office.
All of them are under-valued.
All of them are buying
and selling under valuing it.
A mistake can't be granted
if everyone does it.
Though educated,
how can we be irresponsible?
lt's a crime to cheat
the Government.
To hell with your Government!
We pay taxes for everything.
But we are still suffering.
Are they properly using our tax
money for our welfare?
Some body else is enjoying it.
This is more than
enough for them.
Nandhini, we shouldn't give
reason for our wrong doing.
Now will you do it or not?
- Sorry Nandhini.
l won't do anything illegal!
- Why are you impractical?
Should a practical man do
wrongs and ignore wrongs?!
Sir, do you want me to type or not?
Decide quickly...
don't you see people waiting?
Sir, you type the amount
which l tell you.
He is like this only.
He always talks about rules.
Madam, give me the cash first.
- Have it.
Ganesha, check it out.
This is illegal!
Nandhini, it's paining me that
you too are involved in this!
Showing over reaction!
Go...go and wait in the auto.
You're creating trouble
instead of helping us!
R-E-M-O...
Hi Nandhi...
What is that on your forehead?
That day, l slipped getting
down from your roof.
That is nothing.
Where shall we go?
Le Meridian Coffee Shop?
Dan Pepe... Mexican Restaurant?
Or do you want boogie
at double O discotheque.
l've to go to the college.
Hey Nandhi... we are lovers...
Let's go to some place
and do yo-yo man!
l won't come.
- Why?
Who are you?
- Why suddenly? l'm Remo.
Remo is your name. That's it.
Suddenly you come and vanish...
l don't know about
your whereabouts.
You've expressed
your love, haven't you?
Then why are you simply bluffing?
l like your approach.
l felt happy seeing you.
lt's true that your poetic
words attracted me.
But now... when l think that
you're my future and everything...
l think l'm very fast...
Are you suspecting me?
- l didn't mean that way...
l think l should take some
more time to think about it.
You didn't believe me, right?
You didn't believe me!
Hey...What are you doing?
Remo, wait...
Oh god!
Remo, please stop...
You didn't believe me, right?
You didn't believe me.
Remo, please... listen to me...
Remo... please... stop...
You didn't believe me...
Why are you behaving
like a mad man?
You didn't believe me.
l believe you!
Do you? - Yesl

That is their duty.
We've registered it for under-value.
l've to give bribe amount Rs.2000
to get the approval.
Hey Nandhi... switching on
my testosterone harmones,
why are you leaving me?
At least complete this kiss and go.
What happened Remo?
Remo...
Why are you cheating
the Government?
You shouldn't be alive.
Remo, l'm scared...Please don't

Who is Remo?
l'm Anniyan!
This is your last day!
Last minute.... - Remo...
Remo, what happened to you?
Please leave me....
Oh god! Oh no!
You shit!
Nandhi, you have to get
out of this place.
He is dangerous....
- Remo, what is happening here?
Why are you changing your voice?
No time to talk...
He will kill you.
Remo, who else is here?
Why should we run?
No sinner can escape
from Anniyan!
Oh god! l'm confused!
Nandhi, come on... run away...
He is very dangerous...
He won't leave you alive.
Nandhini, run away...
Hey, she has to die...
Don't try to save her... l'll kill you.
My love...
She is my soul.
l'll not allow you to kill her.
Run away!
What man? To hell with your girl friend!
You mad fellow!

Hey Skin head! Move away!

What crime have l committed?
Why are you after my life?
The money that should've

it's a crime to undisclosed.
For the crime of underquoting

For keeping Rs. 4 lakhs

Registration documents.
How do you know all this?
Who are you?
Aren't you Ambi?
Aren't you Ambi?
Who is Ambi?
l am Anniyan!
Hey! Don't lie to me.
l've seen the same wound
mark on Ambi also.
Are you acting as Ambi?
ls Ambi acting like you?
Who is Remo amongst you?
Ambi, Remo, Anniyan!
Which one of you is true?
You're going to die!
That's true!
l've got you!
You're Ambi!
Dejected about losing me,
you've come in a
disguise to avenge me.
This is registration document,
sharp thorns will pierce into you.
This is fire...die!
Ambi, leave me.
Why are you behaving
like a mad man?
You said you love me very much.
Will anyone kill his own lover?
You were a gentleman.
Why are you after my blood?
What happened to you?
ls your love for me, a lie?
Tell me Ambi!
Oh god! Fire!
Sorry Nandhini!
What's this?
Why did he try to kill me?
ls he mad, ghost or a psycho?
Or is he just play acting?
l'm confused, Doctor.
We can find by regress process,
using recovery therapy.
Tell me, Mr. Ramanujam,
are you feeling comfortable?
What's your problem?
l can't tolerate even
little mistakes.
l get tensed.
What do you do then?
What can l do?
l get upset.
l cry...then l get headache.
Like my head breaking into pieces.
What happens then?
Suddenly everything goes blank.
l don't know what happens after that.
l find myself elsewhere
when l wake up.
ln a different dress...differently.
Don't worry.
lf you co-operate with me,
everything will be all right.
Ramanujam. concentrate on this disc.
See with concentration.
Your eyelids will become heavy.
You'll feel sleepy.
5...4...3...2...
Ambi! - Yes.
Shall we slowly look into your
young age?
Now your age is 16.
Nandhini came to my house
for the first time yesterday.
When asked for a
cup of coffee powder,
her finger touched me.
Now, your age is 1 4.
lX class...l had typhoid.
Age 10.
Vidya!
Who is Vidya?
Younger sister.
Very intelligent.
l love her.
lt was Gandhi's birthday.
We had been to a debate and
fancy dress competition.
Rain had just stopped
after lashing heavily.
lndia is number one
in Arts and Culture.
lndia is epitome
of love and humanity.
What is not abundant in this country?
We should be proud
to be lndians.
Hello!
A live wire is hanging dangerously
in Third cross street of T.Nagar.
Lineman has gone out for tea,
l'll inform him as soon as he comes.
Just two brands only,
a quarter is Rs. 50.
This is daylight robbery.
Today is holiday,
we are taking risk to do business.
lf you don't want, go away.
- Okay, give me.
Take it from the flower shop.
A quarter for him.
Today no business sir.
Don't act smart man!
Don't l know that you're selling
from the flower shop.
Give my cut.
Have you found any country like ours?
Have you found anyone working
more hard than we lndians?
Everyone has holiday
on Gandhi's birthday
We don't have a holiday.
lf the rainy season starts,
we'll get a call every five minutes.
Complaining about power cuts
to torture us.
Hello, has the lineman
come back or not?
A livewire is hanging...
anyone may get killed...
Hello!
Danger! Live wire!
lf the enthusiastic youth spend their time
in studying and nation building,
lndia will become
number one in 20 years.
Debate first prize goes
to Vidya Parthasarthy.
Rickshaw puller! Why are you
entering a no entry road?
lt's wrong.
The other route is long and winding.
Don't go near,
there's a livewire in water.
8 years, your Honour!
ls it any age to die?
This court must punish everyone
responsible for her death.
What is the crime Mr. Parthasarathy?
lrresponsibility!
Dereliction of duty!
Who all should be punished?
First one is the lineman.
On getting the complaint,
he should've cut the power,
but got drunk on duty.
lnstead of closing the shop
on Gandhi's birthday,
the shop keeper who sold liquor.
The policeman who allowed
it by taking bribe.
The rickshaw puller who
entered a no entry road.
The contractor who laid
the road badly with potholes.
Corporation which allowed
the water to stagnant.
The Engineer who approved it.
The Minister who passed the contract.
The factory that produced inferior wire.
The authority who approved it.
The area supervisor
who didn't check regularly.
Your honour, that means you've to
send entire Tamil Nadu to jail.
This is not a matter to laugh.
This is a matter we have
to think seriously.
At least one among all these
had done his duty properly,
my daughter would've
been alive now.
Either directly or indirectly those
responsible for her death,
should be punished, your honour.
Everyone should be punished.
This isn't a case at all,
it's an accident.
When lightning or thunders strike,
neither you, me, or my learned
friend can do anything.
Any wire will break
at some point of time.
We can send summons
to Lord Varuna for the rains.
Don't talk irresponsibly!
Carelessness of a few caused
the death of an 8 year old girl.
Our sincere sympathies
are with you.
lt's a great personal tragedy.
Man is helpless before
the fury of nature.
This is an unexpected accident.
This court can't punish
anyone in particular.
Case dismissed.
Death ceremony for
a third class student!
You too crying like a child!
More than the sorrow
of losing a child,
the people responsible
have escaped the punishment.
l can't take that.
Teacher beats us if we don't
do our homework.
They failed to do their duty
won't they get punished, grandma?
Don't say like that Ambi.
God is watching everything.
They'll surely get punished on the
banks of Vaitharini in the Hell.
What punishment, grandma?
A man Chitragupta will record
all your good and bad deeds.
According to the
judgement of Lord Yama,
one will get punished according
to the sin they commit,
tooth for tooth, nail for nail,
life for life,
one has to definitely get punished.
My sister died because of some
people's carelessness.
l don't want anyone to
lose their life because of me.
That's why l go by
the rules always.
A conformist to the core.
l can't tolerate other's irresponsibility
and inhuman behaviour.
l'll cry, get headache after that.
What happens after that?
l don't know, doctor.
What do you become after that?
Think...think deeply...
- Severe headache.
After that...after that...
l sweat profusely.
Okay...okay...
What happens after that...?
After that...? l don't know.
Ambi, l know you can.
Come on.
Think... - Headache...
After that...after that...
Hey Doctor!
Why are you troubling Ambi?
What's this cheating people
using hitech gadgets?
Who are you?
Anniyan!
What's the connection
between you and Ambi?
Ambi is an innocent man, simpleton.
A useless man.
He just spends time wasting on
pursuing public litigation cases.
He is useless in stopping injustice.
l decided to stop it myself.
How?
l opened a web site,
www.anniyan.com.,
posted 15 cards for people
to lodge complaints.
it spread all over the nation,
and complaints flooded
my web site.
every injustice in this country
is in my database.
What are you planning
to do with them?
l'm not obliged
to tell you that.
Please don't get angry
for asking you this.
Have you killed anyone till now?
What? Trying to
get smart with me.
You're a Doctor,
not a Commissioner.
What do you feel on seeing this?
Hey Doctor! Are you crazy?
How can a barbarian
know about roses?
Ask me.
Rose means beauty.
Beauty means Nandhi.
The sweetest candy.
You...?
- Dude...l am Remo.
Ramp walk model...rose seller...
Gentle lover...
What's the connection
between you and Ambi?
Ambi is a useless fellow.
He loved Nandhini for 8 years.
Unable to express it to her,
keeping within himself and
bungled writing letter.
He almost committed suicide.
Then l came.
The love he impounded in himself,
l made it to flow out like champaign
as words, flowers and love.
Now she loves me.
You are above all...
Just tell her...
She's the one...
She needs somebody to
tell her that it's gonna...
What do you do for
your love expenses?
Simple, l pledged Ambi's
house documents.
lt's all for the love...
of the love...
You're above all...
Just tell her she's really wanted...
Dr. Bruce, what do you think?
Confirmed! lt's multi personality disorder.
He's not acting.
What do you mean?
Multipersonality disorder means more
than two personalities in one man.
You mean possessed by ghost?
Nothing like that.
Some people with
lot of mental pressure,
their brain develops
a new personality within.
When the pressure
reaches the peak point,
the new personality takes over
without their knowledge.
How is it possible to change to someone
else without their knowledge?- Why not?
Look at drunkards,
they remain calm.
But after drinks their behaviour
changes dramatically.
Next morning they deny
behaving like that.
You would've seen women
getting possessed,
they would've been
calm before that.
But it's difficult to control them
once they get possessed.
They'll call everyone
by their first names.
They'll burn camphor
on their tongues.
You feel like slapping
a wrong doer, but you can't.
You feel like killing unjust people.
But we keep quite honouring
the society and law.
These little feelings
locked up in our hearts,
they break open
as multiple personality disorder.
Anyone else had the same problem?
A girl Eve in Georgia
had three personalities.
Judy Kestling of New York
had 44 personalities.
She told about herself
in a website.
Do they know about this, Doctor?
Ambi doesn't know about the existence
of 2 other personalities in him.
But Anniyan and Remo know
Ambi as different person.
How long will these personalities last?
One minute...one day...
may be a week too.
But changes alternatively.
No one is sure when and
how long it will stay?
Can't it be treated?
We can treat.
One year...two years...
may take 6 years also.
But can't be sure.
- Why?
The day Ambi's wishes get fulfilled,
the day other personalities
become useless,
they'll disappear on their own.
Didn't get you Doctor?
For example,
if you truly love Ambi,
Remo will become useless.
lt's in your hands for Remo to disappear.
Anniyan...?
ln the hands of this country.
lf no one commits mistakes,
Anniyan will disappear.
Will he try to kill me again?
Definitely!
Oh god!
Don't get afraid.
lf you pay your taxes properly,
he'll spare you.
This is little complicated case.
Bring him next week.
Let's have another session.
Till then, keep this a secret from Ambi.
l'll pay my taxes...
don't harm me.
What's it Nandhini?
What's wrong with me?
Nothing to worry,
Doctors suggested medication.
Got something?
Boss, very strange website.
There are millions of
websites like these.
lnfact there are websites
to make RDX bombs also.
No boss, take a look at these visuals.
lt appears like hell.
Crime!
Cutting sandalwood trees illegally.
Criminal's name?
Veerappan!
ldentification?
Big moustache.
Don't worry.
Everyone will be punished
according to 'Garudapuranam'
This is...
Garudapuranam...?
Exactly sir.
l feel it's him.
lt's very...very hot.
Good work Arivazhagan...good clue.
Can we trace him?
- Boss! No need to trace him.
Look here, he's making
a personal appearance,
coming Sunday at Nehru Stadium.
Sir, a man Ambi is here to see you.
- Ambi..?
How many times l've told you
not to come here for me?
What's the urgency?
Do you know anyone
at Sangeet Academy?
l know the secretary, why?
Nandhini loves to sing
in this season.
You're a damn fool!
You know she doesn't love you.
Why are you after her then?
Though she doesn't love me,
l can't hate her.
She's just an ordinary girl,
don't make her feel proud.
lf you don't like it, leave it.
Don't talk like this.
Wait...wait..you'll become a
melancholy immediately.
Not for her but
l'll do it for you.
Too many schedules this year.
Even NRl's are waiting.
Look, there's a man from California
waiting from yesterday.
Yeah! Cool!
Okay.
Uncle, M.P. Murthy has recommended.
- M.P...?
Couldn't you tell me this earlier?
Vijayashri, sing a song.
Enough...stop it!
What a great voice!
M.P. has sent you,
no need to sing.
l'll schedule in the
evening prime time.
lnform M.P. that her
program got confirmed.
l'll take care of Vijayashri.
You ask him to take care
of my Padmashri.
Thanks. - Thanks.
How about me?
Next season.
Shit! You all stink.
Who are you?
- My name is Ramanujam.
l'm Poochi Srinivasa
lyengar's grandson.
That's past history.
Now, it's time of Dinosaur Mani,
tell me.
Chari of Police dept. has sent me.
Chari is a useless man.
What's the matter?
l know a girl named
Nandhini Krishna.
She's a great singer.
Did she sing before
any Judge or Governor?
She sings at Saint Thiagaraja
Aradhana every year.
Any recommendations
from M.P.or Minister?
She has great talent.
Give her a chance once.
No chance.
Just now l gave a
chance to MP recomended girl.
Come next year, go now,
don't waste my time.
Chari sent me here.
- Let it be anyone, go away.
Just listen to this cassette once.
When she sings along with
children you'll be mesmerised.
Hey Swine!
What's this sudden
change in language?
This is a holy abode
of Trinity of Music,
you're a brahmin
and speaking cheap...
Why don't you give
chance to talented people?
People like you are
a curse to this country.
Recommendation for everything.
Just because near and dear
ones are given preference,
in every field,
the progress is very slow.
Cricket, Hockey, Tennis,
we get defeated always.
We are struggling to win a gold
in Olympics though we are a billion.
Do you think l'll get scared
if you threaten me?
lGP is a life member with us.
Hello...
Oh My false teeth.
People like you deserve this.
What?
The punishment meted
to people like you in hell.
Why are you bringing a lamp?
This is trident.
l've piles.
Whatever her name is...
her program is confirmed.
Come...come...it's getting late.
From Daily Thanthi, sit here.
What happened to Andipandaram?
- He has absconded.- He too.
Can't believe them.
Watch it buddy!
Sir...?
Me? l'm Remo, the ramp walk model.
Nandhini Krishna's boy friend.
Whatever you may be,
clear the place.- Why?
Get up! - Why?
Sit in the last row.
Why are they after someone else's lover?
l'm very happy.
l never expected a chance like this.
l heard it was Ambi
responsible for all this.
Where is Ambi?
How can he come?
He's out there.
He would be weeping
in some corner?
Hey Nandhi!
Will you love only stylish men like him?
You feel sour if anyone
is too good, don't you?
You don't like perfect men.
Good man is boring, isn't it?
Ambi is gold, Nandhini.
Pure gold without any impurities.
That's why he is not
liked by anyone.
Call Remo.
After listening to what l said,
you still want him.
Hi Nandhi! Wow!
Gorgeous!
Are we going to do the yo-yo?
Be serious, Remo.
l want to talk to you. Sit.
Okay. Yeah, tell me.
Stop meeting me hereafter, Remo.
What?
l don't love you.
What's wrong with you?
Why?
You're not real, Remo.

You're an illusion.
Don't come for me hereafter.

Nandhi, this is not fair.
You can't do this to me.

l'm hurting inside.
l can't take this.
l can't take this.
This is killing me.
Nandini, it's late already.
Hasn't the program started yet?
Has your fiance come?
He'll never come.
What about your marriage?
lt's with you only, Ambi.
What do you mean?
l had hurt you many times.
Forgive me, Ambi.
Don't say that. Please get up.
Only if you lift me,
l'll take it as you've forgiven me.
Nandini, something is
happening to me.
My ears are cold.
l want to piss.
Let's have this after marriage.
Someone might come inside.
- Are you ready?
Sorry, l've entered the wrong room.
Ambi you rascal...!
l never expected this from you.
But you've taken
a giant leap forward.
l can't believe this.

Anniyan is appearing
to solve your problems.
Place.. NEHRU S TADlUM.
Evening at 6 o' clock.
Who is Anniyan?
How will he look?
Will he be fair or dark?
No one knows.
But are very eager to know what
he is going to say.
lt's going to be a very hot showl
Very much tensed...
Stop relay of other programs.
Telecast this as live show.
Boss, we've to put this in the
front page of our magazine.
This should be our headlines.
How many are on duty?
- 120 people sir.
Commando forces?
- ln full strength sir.
You will definitely lose him, right?
- Yes sir...
Chari...Prabhakar... - Hey...
Sorry sir, you stamped my feet.
l shouted unable to bear pain.
This is Singapore...yesterday.
ln 1 950's Singapore was
poorer than lndia.
This is Singapore...today.
Their population is
around 42 lakhs.
lt has the land area of 644 sq.km
lt's a smaller city than Bangalore.
A Singapore citizen earns
25 times more than us.
800/0 of people own a flat.
This is the growth
achieved in 25 years...
This is Japan.
An earth quake prone country without
any minerals or petroleum..etc.,
A country defeated in the WW-2.
A country shattered
by the atomic bomb.
A country that was considered
will become desert.
But today they're leading
in agricultural exports.
What's the position of Japan
in the world economy?
lt's in the second place.
Far eastern little countries have grown
rapidly from poorer position than us.
Anniyan!
What you had just seen,
isn't a news reel shown
before a film.
lt's a record of lndia's
missed opportunities.
This is not a religious discourse,
cultural meet...
political meet or prayer meeting....
A meet to rouse our inner souls.
57 years of independence...
100 crores of people....
We've 33 lakhs sq.kms of land,
half of which is agricultural land.
10 perennial rivers,
1 .5 lakhs lndustries...
lnspite of having so many things,
still we hold 49th place
in World Economy.
ln rupees value,
we hold 44th place in the world.
ln Cleanliness and health,
we hold 20th place!
We hold 2nd place in AlDS.
We hold 3rd place in corruption.
Why?
Can anyone of you tell me?
We lack in good Prime Ministers!
We lack in good Chief Ministers!
We lack in good Ministers!
We lack in good Administrators!
We lack in good Police men!
Always we point out
others for mistakes!
How many of us are good citizens?
How many of us are doing
our duties properly?
Cricket match can't be won
merely by having a good captain.
Team of 1 1 should play well.
Only then, they can win!
lf anyone of them doesn't play well,
how much you're frustrated?
100 crores of individuals
form lndia!
Prime Minister, Chief Minister,
Administrators, you and me...
all are individuals!
lf every one of us do our duties properly,
only then, our country can progress!
But what are we doing?
Look at the screen...
He is Mr. Public.
Watch his daily routine work.
You Scoundrell Do you've sense?
- A lot
What are you doing here?
Are you blind? l'm taking rest.
What work did you do to take rest?
l am tired after taking rest,
so l'm taking rest.
Do you have any other work?
l didn't find a suitable job.
Then how do you earn?
Father is a Coolie and
mother is a daily-worker.
Sometimes she goes
for household work.
Will they give you
money to spend?
l'll snatch it from them.
What kind of work you can do?
- Now l'm on duty.
Don't make me tired by talking.
Then l may have to
take rest again.
What can we do with such a man?...
Tell me.
This country doesn't need
such lazy men!
First we have to punish him...
Say it loudly!
We've to punish him!!
l did that only!
Oh Snakes!
This punishment's
name is PUYODHAM!
For those who lead useless
life without any aims!
This is the punishment
given to them in hell!
l'm hungry...
l'm hungry...
Are you hungry?
Have it... you are craving for money,
aren't you? Eat this money!
lnspite of earning so much...
he couldn't able to eat
more than Rs.1 lakh.
He died with dysentery.
This is the punishment for those
who collects exorbitant rents.
Punishment for people
who desire other's things.
ANTHA KUBHAM is the punishment for
not saving an accident victim.
KUMBHl BHAGAM for the one
who serves bad food.
KlRUMl BHOJANAM for the one who
manufactures poor quality products.
Careless if somebody gets hurt...
Careless in serving good food...
Careless in delivering quality products...
Careless in following rules....
Careless in doing duties...
Careless to pay the taxes...
Careless in casting votes...
Least bothered on Leaders...
These small carelessness
pay way to a mega carelessness,
and it has become a national habit...
and it has become a part
of our character!
That's why we still remain
like this without progress.
But l won't leave you.
Hereafter, this will be the
punishment for careless persons!
Quick! Cover all the exits...quick!
Mr. Anniyan!
Yes!
So severe punishment
for little mistakes?
ls mistake a vest to
differentiate with sizes?
Look at the consequences of it.
Everything is extra large.
Does it deserve death penalty?
We do all this in the hope that
no one will kill us for doing this.
How can you take law
into your hands?
When you can break law,
can't l take law into my hands?
What for the Police and
Courts are here?
They are here for
the past 57 years.
Why do the same mistakes
are happening then?
Dacoity, murder, rape
have capital punishment,
that's why we hesitate
to commit.
But who knows about
these small mistakes.
Even if caught, we can
escape paying fines,
or get off the hook by bribing,
so we commit it openly.
My policy will hurt the wrong doers.
lt will arouse the patriots
who love the nation.
Over!
Any questions?
Zoom!
What you have watched now...
...is the token punishment for
the first complaints l received.
l am giving you 24 hours time,
reform and rectify your mistakes.
l'll kill everyone against
whom there's a complaint,
in my website one after the other.
Don't fire at him.
l want him alive.
Close all the exit gates...immediately!
Anniyan! Autograph please.
Move!
l said move!
Move...move.
He's missing!
Sir, you missed him as l said.
Freeze the picture.
Remove his hair and
show me in graphics. - Okay sir.- yeah!
What about the Anniyan.com website?
1 .5 lakh complaints have
been registered.
lt's very difficult to find who will be
punished and when in this list.
Then do one thing,
you need a phone connection
to open these mails to read.- Yes sir.
Check which phone line he's using.
Oh My god!
Yearly tax collection
is just 5000 crores only.
Today's collection is 15000 crores!
People who evased till
now are paying taxes.
Who said lndia is a poor country?
Sir found the dial-up phone
number from the lP address. - Good!
Which area?
Triplicane...
Tholasinga Perumal Koil street.
Another fascinating thing in this is...
...the 5 murders committed were
from the same complainant.
His phone number is also the same.
- What?
The complainant and the receiver
have the same phone number?
Confusing...?
Who has that number?
Not a beggar at signal or near temple,
city looks dry cleaned.
Remarkable change.
Don't taunt lndia can't
progress like America.
Ramanuja lyengar!
Sir! Anniyan's face will be like this.
ls your doubt cleared?
Are you happy?
One batch go upstairs.

How many murders you've

He's not lying according
to the polygraph test.
Leave this habitual liar to me,
l'll make him sing in 10 minutes.
Chari, l think they're
planning to beat me.
Please tell them about me.
all evidences
are against you.
Chari! You fool! You too!

Will you punish like in hell?

Do you think am l a fool?
Bloody bugger!
Filthy lump!
Why are you torturing Ambi

....l swear on Lord...
....those 5 murders were....

...Allow Ambi to go out...
Extraordinary performance!
l've seen MGR and Sivaji
act on screen,
Rajini and Kamal too.
But l haven't seen an actor
like you till now.
How did it come to you?
Guards!
Beat him guards!
lt has been proved beyond
doubt that you're the killer.
Do you accept it?
l swear l didn't commit any murder.
Sorry your honour!
Don't believe him.
He's no ordinary man.
Great actor.
Though Ramanujam
is one man in body,
but he's split into
3 personalities mentally.
He's suffering from
Multiple personality disorder.
Ramanujam didn't kill them,
they were killed by Anniyan,
his other personality.
Anniyan?
You can't punish him legally.
Objection your honour.
They are trying to confuse the
case with medical jargon.
No...no...everything about MPD
is clear in these books and CD's.
This is video recording
of Ramanujam's examination.
Vidya died electrocuted in water.
my sister died because of
many people's carelessness.
Headache...
What after the headache?
Who are you?
Anniyan.
What do you feel on seeing this?
You crazy.
You...?
l'm Remo.
Ramp walk model...
rose seller...gentle lover...
Objection your honour!
They are trying to save the
killer using his acting talent.
Excuse me your honour!
lf that's a play acting.
This is a recording of
DCP Prabhakar's inquiry.
Watch this drama too.
l'm sorry.
Who is beating you?
...5 murders...
....l didn't commit...
...l killed them...
Social evils and split personality Anniyan
is responsible for the murders.
l humbly request you to release
Ramanujam, your honour.
No please...don't release me.
l'm not a man, l'm a beast.
l've killed 5 people mercilessly.
Cool down.
Law can't punish you.
Whatever it is l've
committed the murder.
Man doesn't any right
to kill another man.
Your honour, l'm also a lawyer,
l don't want to escape using
the loop holes in the law.
My brain and body is
responsible for their deaths.
lf you release me,
the beast inside me will
kill many other people.
Please kill me!
Please your honour...please.
Hearing the arguments in
the defense of Ramanujam.
lt's established that he's affected
by multiple personality disorder,
and that he's not play acting.
The split person Anniyan
had committed murders,
for which Ramanujam
is not responsible.
lt's impossible to punish Anniyan who
appears & vanishes in seconds.
So till Anniyan completely
comes out of his system,
l order psychological treatment
to Ramanujam under security.
l pronounce to release him
after he's treated fully.
After two years...
Ambi? - Yes.
Father.
How are you father?
ls he Ambi?
Mother!- May you live long!
Unable to recognise you.
How are you Nandhini? - Fine.
How are you idiot?- l'm fine.
What?
- Bloody fools!
There was only one good man Ambi.
You've made him also normal man.
You're going on a honeymoon.
You'll not torture her like
going to Tiruvayaru, isn't it?
No.
What will you do
if the food is bad?
l'll adjust.
lf the toilet is not clean?
l'll close my nose.
lf the fan doesn't run?
l'll use finger to make it run.
Good show boy!
Now you're perfect lndian.
Enjoy!
Have you started so early?
Do l've to wait for an auspicious hour?
l find a bar in your bag.
Excuse me, ladies are here.
Can't you change your place?
lf you feel bad,
change your place.
Come, let's go to another seat.
Drinking in train is illegal.
l drink while l'm in duty.
Won't l drink in train?
So sweet!
Hello.
l'm Dr. Vijayakumar speaking...
Tell me doctor.
- Doctor!
How is he doing?
Any problem?
No doctor.
An important matter.
Anniyan used to come often
asking to release him.
l said they'll release Ambi only if
Anniyan doesn't appear for 2 years.
After that Anniyan never appeared.
He's still as Ambi, isn't he?
Yes doctor.
Just now a man was
drinking before us,
he changed his seat
like a gentleman.
He's completely all right, doctor.
That's nice to hear.
Wish you a happy married life.
Thank you, doctor.
What happened?
