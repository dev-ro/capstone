OK, everyone. Welcome.
This is a wonderful area.
Full of historical treasures.
Imagine the people coming over that hill, -
saw potential in the environment and thought: fishing lake, good drainage.
"We can live here".
Ok. Come on. Gather around in a circle.
Stop, that's good. Thanks.
You won't believe it, but they boiled salmon 
underneath this in the middle ages.
An oven underneath the soil!
An oven underneath the soil!
Over here there was a field of corn, and it was full of life.
Ok. It isn't called the EU, and it's not called Russia.
And it's not the War on terror.
No one has an iPod.
Cellphones and Internet and all that...it's science fiction.
Do you follow? No? OK.
It's 1989. It's called the EEC now, and I fucking hate it.
It's called the Soviet Union, the Cold War and Maggie Thatcher.
We've discovered oil and we're rich.
People here walk around in pink jackets, have perms and mullets -
- and listen to crap music.
(How many do you think lived here in the middle ages?)
Fuck!
Here's an experiment. Close your eyes.
Keep 'em shut.
Imagine:
A sheep, a pig.
A farmer walking around trying to find something to eat.
It's called self-provision.
- Did you say anything, Katrine?
- No, nothing.
It's called self-provision.
What have I done to deserve this? Everything around me is completely idiotic.
All the girls are going to the US
and they're going to become au pair.
"It's going to be so much fun!"
Au pair - what the fuck is that?
I don't have any friends and I haven't fucked.
And I have serious problems with understanding why I'm here.
My name is Jarle Klepp and I need a life.
Fucking cunt of a trip, huh?
Sometimes, you know, life is so fucking pointless.
Where did the holy trinity of pussy, rock and revolution go?
Helge here. Helge Ombo. Jarle, was it?
Just started?
Yeah, I've been smoking for two weeks now. It's fucking great, though.
What are you listening to?
It's kinda special. Don't think you've heard it.
- Try me out
- OK, the record is called Psychocandy
And the band is called The Jesus and Mary Chain. 
Fuck man, it's a classic!
Fuck, have you heard of it? What about Raga Rockers?
My parents had plans for all the things I were to be
Go to school for 20 years, for later to be like them
But there's no future in mowing the suburban lawn
I am a frustrated middle class boy who'll 
sacrifice myself for the scene.
- The girl Katrine is fucking nice
- Yeah
Would've given my right arm to get together with her
The left arm too.
The left arm? What would you jack off with then? Your legs?
Hey, we shouldn't just get the hell out of here?
- Get out of here?
- Yeah, fuck it
Wait up!
To the future, man! Pussy, rock and revolution!
We're Mathias Rust Band. This is Fittesatan Anarkikommando
                (Pussy-satan Anarchy-Commando)
Ein, zwei, drei - Satan!
You don't know what is going on
But you're going to feel this
Pussy-satan Anarchy-Commando - Radar chaos, Power commando
The clock is ringing
I see you're shaking
Pussy-satan Anarchy-Commando - Radar chaos, Power commando
A true terror regime
Power and hell
Pussy-satan Anarchy-Commando - Radar chaos, Power commando
Now that you're feeling it
You know who are creating it
Pussy-satan Anarchy-Commando - Radar chaos, Power commando
So get a bullet and fix a situation.
Cut! Cut!
- What?
- This is going too fast for you.
To me? You're the one who can't get your fingers out of the pussy here.
- Jesus. Katrine?
- It's a childish song anyway.
You're better than this stuff.
Katrine, he's subversive. Right, Andreas?
- We're talking about something different.
- Katrine has a point.
- To...stand there and sing about that pussy stuff just seems dumb.
Maybe we should be more like Sting?
Start an emotional band and call ourselves
"Tea and candles".
- I don't think you understand the gravity.
- Heard of Mighty Dogfood?
What do you mean exactly? What is it you want?
Me and Andreas mean, that if the band is gonna
 take the step away from just band practise -
we should be really fucking careful about making bubblegum pop -
- about eternal love or whatever the fuck you're looking for.
Helge, does everything have to be so black and white?
With all due respect. Despite my feminism:
You don't know shit about this.
Don't know shit? You just asked me what I thought.
- We've got a gig!  
If we want to...warm-up for Mighty Dogfood.
- Are you kidding?
- Folken (venue)
- Oh fuck!
- Are you kidding?
- Fucking Folken!
- Warm-up. For Mighty Dogfood!
Fuck, this band is meant for world domination.
Shit, we need posters. We need to make posters.
- And a logo.
- And buttons.
And we need to make a long fucking music video.
Jump!
- Fuck off, Rulle.
- No.
I mean it, fuck off! I'll tell dad.
I've got just as much right to be here as you.
- You're not old enough, Rulle.
- Neither are you.
- ID?
- Come on, I'm 20.
Come back when you've grown some hair on your nuts.
- Be nice, we're old enough...
- We've been here many time before.
- I knew it.
- Knew what?
No matter how much the Berlin Wall falls, we won't
get in to the cool clubs.
- They see it you know.
- See what?
That we're not old enough. That Jarle bought his glasses at Walmart for a dollar.
Fucking Walmart.
But soon Mathias Rust Band is gonna take over this town.
- Yes we will.
- Cheers!
- Can't I join the band?
- No.
Hey, look here. The biggest cock in Stavanger. Look, Anni.
Oh my God.
Leave Katrine alone. Come here and look at your big brother's dick.
You're so good.
Fuck.
Hold on. Just wait a sec.
This is for you, Katrine. I made a song for you. Just listen.
I was so lost, so lost
All was fighting and all was headwind
Never thought that anyone would tear the wall down
I was so lost, so lost
You weren't mine and I was nothing
Never thought that anyone could tear the wall down
'Cause there was a wall there
Between happiness and me
And you tore the wall down
Eternal love
There should be another verse there. Something about...
...but I'm not finished.
- It was really nice.
- You think so?
I can record it for you if you want.
It might take some time, and I need to finish it.
Yes.
It was really nice. It was a nice song.
Come here.
I was so lost, so lost.
All was fighting and all was headwind
How nice.
- What, are you spying on me?
- Yes. Come on, let me hear the rest.
- Forget it!
- Let me hear it.
No.
Is it for Katrine? She's so nice.
- Don't you think I know that already?
- You're going to school.
There's coffee downstairs. And remember to put on warm socks.
Good bye.
Just sit down there.
OK, people. Let's see.
We have a new student with us today. Yngve Lima.
Hello.
Ok. If you had asked -
- any European -
- before November 9th if he thought the Wall would fall, -
- he would've said "Never. Not in a hundred years".
But.
But, but, but, but.
Poof.
What happened just now?
It was that thing about the Wall. That it fell, luckily.
I think it just shows that communism was a farce,
and that the free market -
- is the healthiest system. Gorbachev said that as well.
Jesus Christ, communism never existed!
It's freedom. The Goal. Communism is the goal!
The video channel is 9, teacher.
As per today, nevertheless. They might have changed it, so.
The news. Last week.
November 10th. The world change.
It's fantastic.
- How long can you hold your breath?
- Hold my breath?
I held my breath.
I have no idea.
Hold on.
Want me to take the time?
OK.
Ready?
Go!
10
20
30
40
50
1 minute.
1 minute and 2 seconds.
Is that good?
I'm just saying that it's good for them
to get organized.
HEy, can you get some booze for the weekend?
It's not like your dad is keeping the count on his bottles.
What is this? Helge plus wasted is true?
No, by all means. We can have a good time without drinking.
You guys?
It's cool that you're having that concert, by the way.
You've heard about that party I'm having, right? 
I've mentioned it, right?
Are you going to practice now already?
No, I'm gonna work out first.
You? Work out?
Yeah, work out. Is that a crime all of a sudden?
No.
If you're going to work out, -
- maybe you'll get picked out for the 
national ice skating league.
Hey.
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I'm Yngve's buddy.
And my chain broke. Is this where Yngve lives?
- You're not Yngve's friend.
 - Step inside.
Hey.
I was on my way to Helge's, but he wasn't home, and then...
or...the chain on my bike fell off, so.
I saw that you lived here, and thought I'd stop by.
What are you listening to?
It's a kind of weird music. I don't think you've heard of it.
OK. Try me out.
You don't want to wash up first?
This is my favourite track.
Come and sit down.
- Who is this?
- David Silvian.
Or Japan. Tin Drum.
Ghost.
- Japan? Isn't that some synthpop stuff?
- Listen.
Pretty cool.
Look.
We went to England on vacation. This is me and David Silvian.
- Is it?
- I met him at a mall.
Did you just walk over and say "Hey. I'm Yngve from Norway"?
"Hello, I am Yngve."
You have a nice voice. You could have been in a band.
I'm not...
Venues and stuff. It's not me.
But listen.
Have you ever seen that clouds can look like things?
There's all kinds of things up there.
Dogs, cats, -
- people, everything.
Can you see, Jarle? What do you think that looks like?
A bunny, maybe.
Oh, you brought coffee?
- I made tea.
-Oh. Tea is fine.
Everything's OK?
All right, we're sitting downstairs.
- Do you play?
- Tennis, yeah.
Cool.
I'm more of an ice skating guy. I work out a lot really.
- Three times a week.
- Really?
- You wanna come play one time?
- Tennis?
Yeah.
- You forgot about it, dad.
- No, jesus. Look here.
Look.
I've got some soft drinks here.
Call for some food.
I'll be back in a few hours. No problem.
Me and you, Jarle.
How is your mother?
Mom is good. She's doing fine.
Yeah...she's doing fine.
It would be nice to see how the two of you are coping.
But...yeah.
So...
Yup.
- The rest of the weekend, me and you, Jarle.
- That's fine. I'm going out tonight.
- Women, huh?
- Woman. Singular form, dad.
Katrine.
I got into the Disco
the place was fucking crowded
where Mini-Travolta
shook his hips in a jailcell
A disco dancer taught me how to fly
but before we got that far I had to go out and puke
Be quiet!
I met some friends and we got wasted
Hush! Listen! Listen!
Be quiet, I'm gonna hold a speech
Hush! I'm gonna say something.
Listen, everything feels fucking great.
Right now everything feels amazing.
Everything is fucking great. And I love you guys to death.
Fuck you.
Fuck!
Shit!
You're just too fucking great.
Have you ever regretted -
- the two of us?
I mean, I chased you for half a year.
No. But...
Sometimes it's like you're one of those wind-up toys.
- Wind-up toys?
- Yeah.
- I'll show you a wind-up toy!
- What are you doing?!
Do you think it'll be us two forever?
Yes.
What is it?
Do you want to go play tennis?
In the name of Jesus Christ. Tennis?! Have you contracted AIDS?
- Helge, get a grip.
- No. Sceptical. Goddamn sceptical.
Are you going to become members of
Stavanger golf Club as well?
- You just don't want to look like a fool.
- Where the fuck do you get it from -
- that Helge Ombo is going anywhere close to a fucking tennis court?
- I think it's mature.
- Dumb!
He dares to change his mind. You dont.
It looks really fucking good.
I've never experienced anything this insane.
Are you a part of this insanity as well? I guess you'll be the judge, huh?
No, I just thought I'd say that I'll attend the concert.
Cool. Here, take a flyer.
The music...is it something like Dire Straits?
Well, I guess you can say that Jarle here, in many ways
is Stavanger's Mark Knopfler.
Hey, girls. Are you coming to the concert?
Take some buttons. Come to the concert.
Have you noticed how the clouds look like things?
It's true.
There's all kinds of stuff up there. Dogs and cats and...
Hey, I thought you might like to borrow this.
Japan. Ah, power in my hands! What crappy synthesizer-pop.
- How did it go with your bike.
- Do you want to come play tennis?
Yes. Yes. Very much so.
Can someone tell me what all this tennis stuff is about?
Yngve is new to the school, and I'm just asking
him if he'd like to come play tennis
What's the problem? Toss a ball up in the air and hit it?
Great. I'll see you later then. If you come, we can play Double.
Double?! "Oh, here it is strange, -"
- I must have arrived on the wrong planet." Do you know who said that?
Obstfelder. He went to this school. And he 
sure as shit didn't play tennis!
And then you go all the way back.
And then all the way forward.
- Dumbass, why didn't you say anything?
- Say what?
That Yngve is the tennis guy. You got all this from him.
You're so good at this.
Thanks.
- We have to do this again.
- Yeah, of course.
- See you later then.
- Bye.
What? Do you have a crush on him?
No, but like. You saw him play tennis.
He was like a Greek god.
Maybe I should sleep with him.
Relax. Did you get nervous?
- No.
- You're nervous. I can tell.
- Jesus, no.
- Yes.
Helge is calling.
I've gone to bed.
...but what the monster doesn't know...
Jarle Klepp?
Yeah.
Sit down.
Cappucino?
Oh...you don't know what that is?
Coffee...with a dash of AIDS.
That was a joke, Jarle.
I meet a lot of people in this business.
And to be honest, -
- I meet a lot of people who want to be filled by their own emptiness.
How about you, Jarle? Are you empty?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't notice until just now.
You have this divine glow.
And Jarle, he's in love, isn't he?
Do you want to be beautiful?
Do you want Tom to make you beautiful?
Yeah.
- You're so goddamn conservative.
- No, but, for fuck's sake. George Michael.
Do you think the vocalist of Mathias Rust Band can look like that?
It's cool, Jarle.
- It's nice. It's not that.
- Come on. Cut it out.
As long as Katrine likes it.
So you're going to stay home with me on a Friday night?
I don't have to go out every weekend, do I?
There's a lot of fun stuff on the TV as well.
What's on tonight? Derrick or Bergerac?
Is it Derrick?
It's Derrick.
What's wrong?
What is it?
I think I might -
- be in love.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.
Sure, but in two people at the same time.
Two.
But Jarle. I think you should think carefully before you....
Katrine is very special, you know that right?
Yeah, I didn't see her at school today. The other one.
And then it was like she wasn't there, you know?
Hey. You've become prettier lately
You've changed.
I'm glad you're mine.
Are you crying?
What do you think?
Come on. No pussy talk here. Tell me what you think.
It's not tight. Not fresh. You just stand around playing by yourself.
You don't listen to each other and then it's like -
- Kim Larsen on drugs or something.
Maybe it's too early.
- Too early for a gig I mean.
- Yeah, it might be.
- I didn't mean to ruin the...
- Jesus, Katrine. You're right!
But we're not a band that gives up. Are we?
No...
I mean, fuck. Trouble. You meet an obstacle in life, and what do you do?
Do you lie down and cry like a little baby?
No, you get up.
Every day after school, we go straight home and get some food -
- and then straight back here. Every goddamn day of the week. OK?
Sure.
- Hey, pretty.
- Hey.
- Is something wrong?
- No, I was just going to arrange the tennis.
Shit, I can't wednesday. My grandmother's birthday.
Oh, that sucks.
Your band...
It would be awesome to get to see it some time.
You sing, right?
- What, now?
- Sure.
- No way.
- Why now?
- It's kinda hard without the band.
- No, come on.
I was so lost. So lost.
All was fighting and all was headwind.
Never thought that anyone could tear the wall down...
Come on!
Almost design. It's really good. This a talent you've got there.
It's good that you liked it, Helge.
Mathias Rust Band!
- Jarle, you're 45 minutes late.
- Yeah, I know. My bike boke. Sorry.
Listen. Let's start with Fittesatan from the get go.
You're right, Helge. We have to show 'em who we are. Mathias Rust Band.
Shit. Jarle Klepp. Finally you got to your senses.
- Cool.
- Look what your girlfriend made.
Shit. That's good. You're so good.
It's cold.
Have you finished that song?
Yeah, I'm getting there. It has to be really good, you know?
Jarle?
Good morning.
Good morning.
Fixed your hair again?
Katrine cut it.
Is something wrong?
I lost my job. I just got fired.
- When?
- Last week.
- But why haven't you told me?
- You had so many things on your mind yourself.
They're going to save some money. Be more efficient.
So I'm superfluous.
But I got a really nice reference letter.
It says that I look at every task -
- as challenging and that I'm a yes-person.
A reference letter?!
Could you please be home with me tonight?
It's so sad.
Office people, huh?
Fucking capitalists.
It's a pressed business, right? Shitloads of unemployed people.
Yeah. So I'm just gonna have to stay home tonight.
So I can't work on the flyers or practise or anything.
Of course.
Hey, nice weather! I've got a package for a Reidun Kristiansen.
- Is this where she lives?
- No, further up the street.
- Up this street?
- A hundred feet up.
But listen man. Get a life. What are you doing on Saturday?
- We're having a gig on Saturday.
- What are you playing?
Take these and deliver them on your route, OK?
I'll see what I can do.
What are you doing Saturday? Mathias Rust Band are playing at Folken.
You'll be there on Saturday, right?
Maybe I'll go to the store and buy something for later.
Some chocolate. What's the name of that chocolate you like so much?
I can't be home all day.
We have that concert coming up.
We have to practise and I can't let down the band.
- You're getting better and better.
- You think so?
Is that for me?
What...?
Is it? What...?
It's a song I made, and the rest is some stuff I recorded.
You can listen to it if you like.
I make a lot of these. It's like a mixtape.
Hey!
Oh, mom just went to bed, so...
I called your mom. She said you'd gone to practise.
- It's dad. Right?
- Fuck, man. Are you gonna blame him now?
I'm out of here. I'll be there on Saturday.
Mixtape, huh? You've made a lot of these lately, or what?
- Don't you think I see what's happening here?
- What is it?
Mixtape. Your dad and your mom.
You don't care about them, just as you don't care about the rest of us.
- Don't you think I see?
- See what?
- Jesus, can't you juset say it?
- What? What do you want me to say?
- That it's over, Jarle.
- Over? She's my girlfriend for fuck's sake.
That's not what I'm talking about. The band! Mathias Rust Band!
If you want to let down the band, your mom and your dad...
If you want to drink tea and listen to Sting, that's fine with me. But tell me!
You're way out there.
Everyone can see that you've changed.
What's the matter with you? How did you know I was here?
Are you following me?
How many friends do you have, Jarle?
Fuck, I...
And how many friends do I have?
- Helge!
- Don't even start, Jarle.
- Hey it's Katrine
- It's me.
- Have you talked to Helge?
- Yes.
What is it that you're doing?
- Playing tennis.
- What about your mother?
- Can I come out to your place?
- No. Helge is here. He's mad.
Jeez.
Well, it had to happen. Goddamn efficiency.
That job would never have worked out.
You have to support her now.
You're the...
Yeah.
You and me. That was a damn fine trip.
Great trip. Do you remember?
You remember how you cried to get that thing?
I did?
You're the man of the house now.
You have to support her now, you understand?
Yeah, I do understand.
But it's not easy right now. A lot of stuff is going on with...
I think I might be losing the band and Katrine.
In love with two girls at the same time.
Yeah, that's a challenge.
That's when you have to shape up.
The band has not broken up, and she hasn't left you yet.
You've got a girl to take care of. And you lose friends, you know, -
- if you keep ignoring your appointments.
Listen to me. I actually know a thing or two about this.
This isn't the time where you call Helge and say: "When do we practise?"
Or to Katrine asking if you'll see her again. Say:
"We're practising tomorrow at seven. Tomorrow at seven."
You'll see. They'll come.
And look here.
-You don't need to...
- I know.
But it's the weekend soon.
I mean, I'm your dad.
And say hello to your mother, all right?
And tell her...
It's nice that we can help each other.
What more do you want me to do? Wash the floor with my tongue?
It's world domination or good-bye. It's your choice.
- Are you done with your bullshit?
- Yes.
- Are you afraid?
- I'm not.
Do you want pot or do you want to die without self respect?
Well, I don't want to die from sore feet.
Jesus. Did you write it down?
It's fucking evidence, man!
No, relax. It's just you and me here.
- Me and you in prison.
- No, relax. Just look.
Here's number 32 and his name is Stegasen. It says Helgesen on the mailbox.
It's here.
Hey.
Do you want to buy lottery tickets?
- Do you really know his name?
- Yeah. It's Stegasen.
- But his real first name?
- His name is Stegasen.
He lives here somewhere, in a house with the number 2 in it.
It's a white house.
Jesus, look around. All the houses are white.
Look here. 42.
Hey kid, come over here.
- Is your dad home?
- Yes, he's inside.
His name isn't Steinar or Staale, or...?
- No, it's Gustav.
-...Stein or Svein, or...
- Hey, I'll deal with this.
You and your dad. You don't run a little "shop" around here?
No.
- You don't sell plants of spices?
- No, my dad is a carpenter.
Jesus, of course. It's dead similar, right? 52 and 32.
32, 52.
52, 30.
Come on, wait.
We shouldn't just drink beer? We don't have to become drug addicts this weekend.
Do you want pot, or do you want to die without any self respect?
Stegas?
Are you Stegasen?
The Pot Man? Bingo grass? Circus green? Weed? Angel dust?
- Peter Pot? Pot Stew?
- Are you some kind of retard?
Standing here and screaming for ganja outside my house?
Sorry, buddy. You don't have any left for us to buy, do you?
Yeah, of course I do.
But I need help for something, so...
- I'll just wait here.
- No fucking way.
- We don't need to go in the two of use, do we?
- Just come inside.
Oh...shit. We smoked the whole thing.
I'm Helge Ombo.
You remember that time? 
You talked to me as if I were Helge Ombo.
And I was. I mean, I am.
Yeah.
And you were Jarle Klepp.
And you are.
You don't know what's going on, but you're gonna feel this
Pussy-satan Anarchy-commando. Radar-chaos, Power-commando
Could I get more bass in the monitor, Mr. Sound?
Could I get more of myself in the monitor?
Hey, should we go with Chopped Liver? We're going for it.
What kind of piss is this?
- Do you think Mighty Dogfood liked it?
- No.
It's hard. Monitors I mean.
- Wanna take a walk?
- Can I come?
Rulle, if you stay here, you can watch my bag.
Fuck man. Am I gonna sit here and watch Jarle fall asleep?
MRB, MRB, MRB! 
- Have you been smoking?
- Smoking?
Oh shit. Fucking idiots!
Come on, we only smoked a little. An appetizer. Just tested the stuff.
Put it down! We're going on stage soon for fuck's sake!
- Don't be such a dick ("KUG")
- Fucking hell.
Don't look at me. I only had a beer.
We agreed not to smoke before the gig. I can't believe this.
Hey, look at me. Do I look zoned out?
Hey, come on. Where are you going?
What the hell do you expect? We had an agreement.
Ok, so I fucked up. You're just pisse off 'cause you couldn't join.
Are you going to complain about that? We're putting on a show for Mighty Dogfood.
- How many friends do you have, Helge?
- With or without Rulle?
Mea culpa all the way to the bank. I screwed up!
I play drums like a god.
I'm the Saviour Helge Christ, suffered under Pontius Pilatus. Right?!
-Come on.
- Goddamn....
- Fucking kindergarten.
- Me and you.
- What is it?
- Nothing.
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah, yeah.
Oh my God, it's packed in there. It's insane.
Let me look at you.
Cool.
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.
Yeah, I'm ready as well.
We're Mathias Rust Band, and this is Pussy-satan Anarchy-Commando
Ein, zwei, drei - satan! 
Where's my drumstick?
- Wait up, Jarle!
- That's the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.
You were really good, Jarle.
You were excellent.
You shone up there.
- You think?
- You were really good.
Where are you going now?
I don't know. I thought I'd go home.
You aren't going to that party everyone's talking about?
- Are you?
- Are you?
Come and sit down, Andreas. You're making a fool of yourself.
Where did Rulle go?
What a fucking disaster. Did you see the faces on Dogfood?
Yup. There's only one thing to do. Cheers!
- Yngve, you want a beer?
- No thanks.
- You can have some red wine.
- Yes, that would be great.
I think the concert was great.
Maybe not the second song, but the first one was excellent.
And all the big bands have had trouble in the beginning.
I think you've got it. Seriously. You've really got it.
Fuck, you're not so bad, Yngve. I've always said that.
Nice that you could come. There are drinks in the bar if you want some.
- And it was a really good concert.
- Hey, what a fantastic house you've got here.
Yes...
- And really great music!
- I'm glad you like it.
But I have to go. Many things to do, you know...party,and...
- Hey.
- Damn good concert.
It was great. We're fans.
Shut up!
- Did you see them?
- No it's probably that thing.
- What thing?
- They're probably feminists or something.
Come and dance for fuck's sake!
- Rulle, where have you been?
- Upstairs.
Hey, the Pill. We can smoke that.
- Are you gonna smoke that?
- Yeah, you just put them inside.
Oh my God.
Shit. It says DICK on my forehead.
No, really? Where?
Fuck you, man! God!
Fucking idiots. Why didn't you say anything?
- I thought it was on purpose.
- On purpose?!
Yeah, like an antipole to Pussy-satan or something. I don't know.
I think it was cool, though.
Oh, fucking...
Yuck!
I was so lost, so lost.
All was fighting and all was headwind.
Shit, Jarle, isn't this you?
You weren't mine and I was nothing.
never thought that anyone could tear the wall down.
'Cause there was a wall there.
Between happiness and me.
- Hey, what is this?
- Jarle recorded it for me.
Incredible song. You should've played that one at your concert.
Hey, what is this?! What are you trying to say here?
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What the fuck are you trying to say? What's the matter with you?
- Calm down.
- Aren't you gonna say something?
Are you just gonna look at clouds and play tennis?
Do you think I like playing tennis?!
What the fuck is wrong with you exactly?
Your petty white tennis socks.
Japan. That fucking gay synthpop crappy music of yours.
What the fuck is wrong with you, huh?!
Fuck, are you gay or what? Fuck!
- I'm in love with you.
- What?
You heard me.
I'm in love with you too.
Do you think I'm gay?!
Jesus christ, I have the best girl in the world!
Yngve!
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You're an arrogant, narcissistic idiot. That's what you are.
- Calm down!
- You're just like your dad.
- What the hell are you doing?
- That's none of your fucking business
Just shut up. go fuck yourself. All of you.
Go to hell!
- Katrine? Katrine?
- Oh shit.
Where are you going?
Jarle.
She's in ninth grade.
Fuck. Ninth grade?
- Why was Katrine here?
- I don't know, Jarle.
But Jesus. Did I...?
Did I....?
Oh shit.
My God, what have I done?
Mom, can you leave the room?
- I'm having a bath.
- You've got a visitor.
What are you guys doing?
Do you want to be left alone?
Shit.
I've been so fucking stupid. And that song...
Katrine, I don't think anything happened.
- I don't even know why I'm here.
- Katrine, wait!
Katrine.
You used me. You use big words all the time, but you don't mean it.
Katrine.
I believed you.
You said it would be the two of us.
You said so.
Have you seen Yngve?
You're unbelievable.
You're goddamn unbelievable!
What is going on here, Jarle?
I don't have a girlfriend anymore.
Hey...
Little darling.
What are you doing, Jarle?
Is it that other girl?
Yes, I'm in love. Or...
I was in love. I don't fucking now.
In a...
I heard you lost your job. It's horrible.
I should never have...I hope you're not...
I bought some flowers...
Leave! We don't want you here! Do you understand?! Leave!
You're a goddamn phony!
Leave!
Do you want me to leave as well, Sara?
This is what happens when you smoke pills, Jarle.
Shut up.
I guess pot is sort of overrated.
Yeah...
Should I call Katrine?
It might be too early.
Have you seen or talked to Yngve?
- Has he come to school?
- I think he's sick.
Shit. I'm gonna go to sleep for an entire year.
Can you just give my regards to everyone and tell them that Jarle Klepp is a moron?
Here's the homework for next week.
But listen...
This is a really good song!
Tomorrow. You'll get better by tomorrow right?
Let's go out and have a few beers. Get things in order again.
Yeah that'd be nice.
See you later.
Take the first shot.
- How is your mom?
- Doing fine.
Your mom is a strong woman.
- And your father?
- No, he's still the same.
Pretending like the deals with stuff better than he really does.
Sounds like Rulle.
How about you? When are you getting a girlfriend? You're not that hideous.
I have to tell you something Jarle.
I'm quitting the band.
You're joking? We just fucking agreed.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
- And about Katrine. It...
- By all means. Come on. Spit it out!
So you think the same about me as she does?
Ok, forget it. I'm quitting the band, OK?
What is it? Tell me!
I know you. Tell me what it is! Can it be that fucking difficult?!
- Yes, as a matter of fact it is.
- Well, I'll wait.
You've been out there lately, right?
Katrine might have needed someone right now. 
And that someone might've been me.
What the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Are you two together now?
- Fucking idiot!
- Watch the table!
Fuck you, Helge!
Fucking idiot.
- I'm so fuking tired of you.
- All this talk of yours.
This political bullshit that people think you invented yourself.
You're just a goddamn copy of your parents!
What about you? You're a copy of me! A bad one!
Who do you think you are?!
Jesus Jarle. Look at yourself.
Don't you get it?
You almost killed the guy. You nearly fucking killed him, Jarle.
Don't you understand? Yngve is sick, Jarle.
Hey.
That's a nice doll you've got there.
When we go to The Big House, I'm getting a new toy.
That's great. Is Yngve here?
Yngve walked on the bridge.
Yngve walked on the bridge. He's not allowed to do that.
Mommy says Yngve's head hurts, so he has to go on vacation to the Big House.
- Are you Jarle?
- Yes.
You have to leave. Mommy and Daddy says you aren't allowed to be here.
Is it all right to have visitors?
Hey.
It's nice here, isn't it?
- I didn't know...
- It's a good enough place.
We get to take walks each Friday.
And we can play bingo and football.
And swim.
- I should've known.
- Do you want something?
- Lemonade?
- Yes.
Are you angry with me?
Thanks for the tape. I listen to it all the time.
You want me to tell you something?
One day I saw a cloud over the city -
- that reminded me of a dog running, -
- barking and wagging it's tail.
But then, all of a sudden the sky changed, 
- while the dog just ran on the field.
Ran and ran.
But you know what, Jarle?
- He knows.
- What?
That it will soon be over.
He knows that when the sky dissolves, the dog will die.
But you know what?
While he dies, he remembers that he once was a dog.
Look. It's me and David Silvian.
In England. Do you think I look silly?
No.
I think you look great.
You want to play tennis Wedneday?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
It didn't hurt.
Do you think the train will ever arrive?
Of course it will. It's still a social democracy, isn't it?
Shit.
Fuck.
What a girl, huh?
All the ladies in the world, assembled in one girl.
Maybe if we start a band, she'll join us.
- In the band?
- Yeah.
Yeah, women in bands always means trouble. Yoko Ono?
- Maybe she should be the manager.
- What should we call ourselves?
- I've got a great name. Pussy-satan Anarchy-commando.
We can't. I can't tell my mom that I play in Pussy...
Of course you can. Jesus.
- How about Mathias Rust Band?
- Mathias Rust.
It's very rude. I mean, he just...
He was a petit-bourgeoisie West German with a flight certificate.
I don't think the train will arrive, man.
There's a bus there. Should we try and catch it?
Come on, it's leaving! Let's go!
Come on!
Wait up!
