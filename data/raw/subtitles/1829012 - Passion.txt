Panasonic; ideas for life.
These are terrible.
It's actually... really bad.
Yeah.
Horrible.
Oh, we need... something raw,
something that doesn't look like
it's from outer space.
I mean our smartphone
has to be the smartest.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We need...
We need...
It's so beautiful here.
It's perfect.
Thank you.
You have excellent taste.
Not only that. You know
what I like about you?
You are...
...conscientious.
You are incredibly bright...
...and...
...you're driven.
Like me.
WOW!
What was that?
It's... it's organic.
It's organic?
It's healthy.
So that's good for me!
Yeah!
Oh, hello.
Hello.
Two drunken bees
hard at work, huh?
And I'm disturbing you...
I should go.
Oh no, no, no, no.
Don't go. Stay.
We love surprises.
Yes, you do.
Hello, Isabelle.
Hello, Dirk.
I better get going.
Just, Isabelle leave it.
Yeah.
You should stay, Isabelle.
Good night, Dirk. Good night.
Good night.
Isabelle...
Wait.
It's freezing out.
There...
That's lovely. You keep that.
Oh, no, no, no, I can't accept that.
Yes, you can.
I think we make a really good team.
We do. I'll work on this at home.
You're crazy.
I love it.
Fuck!
Stop.
Just fucking stop.
Hi.
I'm sorry to wake you up.
I just got a great idea for
the campaign. Can you come over?
Yeah.
And bring the tightest
pair of jeans you've got.
Jl/lorn/'ng.
Rolf, hi.
No, I can't.
No, no.
This weekend is terrible.
I'm going to London.
I'm going to London
in like three hours.
Reynold is going.
Okay.
Yeah.
I'll figure it out.
Okay, I think we've got it.
Let's see what we have.
What do you think?
Yeah, but what do you think
about the rest of it?

Good morning, Miss Standford.
Good morning.
And I want a list of everyone's budgets,
research accounts, and financials,
on my desk by tomorrow.
Christine, I can't make it till to...
Do you want me to do it?
No, but...
No, because that's your
job, Eric, right? Right.
Right.
Thank you, that's all.
Good morning.
Oh, hi, good morning.
Oh, look at those eyes!
Are you all hung over?
Oh, no.
I woke up in the middle of the
night and I... I think I got it.
You got it?
Yeah, I think so.
I did something this morning
and I want you to have a look.
Hmm, okay.
I... I think it's pretty good.
DO you?
H1} guys.
So, how hot...
mare my girlfriend's ne w jeans?
Well...
pretty hay
Bu! /...
I have a memory stick for you
so you can run it on the plane.
Hmm...
No, I don't think so.
Oh, hmm...
Why not?
Because you're going to London!
Oh...
Really?
Yes, really.
Isabelle, you know these
campaigns inside and out,
including this latest brainstorm.
I think you will do an amazing job.
But you haven't really seen it.
I've seen enough...
...and I trust you.
Dirk is going to meet' you
at the airport
He knows London very Well
So, you'll be in good hands.
H1} guys.
So, how hot are my gir/fi/end 's
ne w jeans?
Well...
pretty hay
But I'm prejudice so...
how can we find out?
I don't know...
...but What is that thing
in my back pocket?
So... you're ready?
Gooo'.
Ass cam.

Ass cam.
Are you ready to see what
the man in the street thinks?



You know what,
Dani, I'm really tired.
I think I'll just head back to the hotel
and order some room service.
I'll see you in the morning.
Thanks.
I can't believe you're here with me.
You're incredible.
You're beautiful.
We are crazy about this idea.
We love it.
We're actually thinking
of going international with it.
Oh, what?
What?
That's so amazing!
It's funny, I just got this brainstorm
in the middle of the night.
Funny how that happens sometimes.
Outstanding!
...I can tell you now,
I was a little worried...
...when I heard that you weren't
going to be here yourself.
Well, I'm sorry if I
worried you, J. J. It's just
we have our annual audit coming up
and I thought I should probably stay put.
I briefed Isabelle down
to the very last detail.
She was on the ground, I was in
reserve, ready to step in if need be.
Oh, Ok.
Well done, Christine.
Thank you.
Tell me something,
have you got any interest in...
...coming home to New York?
And desert the natives?
I've grown rather attached to them,
but they might be ready to make
a go of it on their own.
Can I think about it?
Sure.
Okay.
You call me. We'll talk.
We'll talk. Bye bye.
Bye, now.
Bye.
Amazing.
You're shocked because
I took credit for your idea?
Honestly, I would expect you to do
the exact same thing in my place.
I wanted New York,
but I wasn't counting on it.
And thanks to you,
I got my shot and I took it.
I mean there's no
back stabbing here.
This is business, Isabelle.
And we're all on the same team.
You have talent.
I made the best use of it.
So, thank you.
Now, tell me...
How was London?
Oh...
It was good.
Things are so much more fun
with Dirk around, aren't they?

What sucks?

When the team works,
everybody wins.
My success depends on hers.






Thank you.
Hey-
H9)'-
Guess what?
I'm kidnapping you.
Beautiful.
Hmm, yeah.
Hmm?
But very high.
Red. Crazy red.
I love that detail here.
That's madness.
Do you think I could wear those?
All right, next job please come on in.
All right, come on, let's go.
Christ, who hired this woman!
Can you get off the stage, please?
I'm so glad you're coming with me.
These cocktail parties are so boring,
but you have to go and work the room.
Okay...
...how do they feel?
They look good.
Hmm, that's all that matters.
I'm not sure that I can walk in them.
Don't they make you feel
just a little naughty?
Oh...
You're very secretive, you know.
Am I?
Yes.
We've been working together 8 months,
and I don't even know where you're from...
...or what you want.
What do you want?
I don't know.
What do you want?
Well, I used to want to be admired.
Iadmire you.
Hmm...
Well, now I want to be loved.
You need some colour.
Okay, are you ready?
I think so. I'm not sure
that I will survive, though.
Well, here, I'll teach you to make
meaningless small talk and you'll be fine.
Marc... hello.
So nice to see you.

This is Isabelle.
Okay, now you're up.
Up for what?
Well...
...you see that guy over there,
the bald guy his nose in his drink?
Yeah.
He is a very b/g fish
for our company.
You land him,
you can run the account.
Oh, I can't. I'm not like you.
I don't know how to do this.
You're more like me
than you think.
I'm drunk.
Even better! That's great!
Just get him to talk about himself.
You know, I mean that's
man's favourite subject.
Okay.
Okay?
Okay.
Ready?
Yeah.
Okay, go.
Hang on, hang on.
Here, he likes some skin.
Here we go.
You're perfect.
Okay.
Nice to meet you. Hi.
I'm Isabelle, hi.
What a nice surprise! I love
we keep running into each other!
Rolf, hi, how are you?
How about next weekend?
I'm very busy right now.
Maybe another time.
- Mmm...
- Ro/zf please.
Can '1' getaway?
My jet is at your disposal.
And not just my jet.
You 're embarrassing yourself
Go home.
Remember I'm the guy that
sa veo' you from dreary London 7
Yes, Shh...
How about
the Seychelles this time?
You know what?
How about I call you next week?
Can't get away? Have you lost
your little standing, your little puppet?
You are drunk.
Go home.
Isabelle, I...
I'm going home.
I have a headache.
It's not what you think.
What?
That I'm your little puppet?
You think that I sent you to London
because it was convenient for me,
but I sent you to London
because I trust you.
I mean what difference
does it make?
Come on, just... stay.
Just stay a while for another drink.
I'm going home. I'm not well.
I'll just grab a taxi.
You understand, right?
See?
This is where I live.
Do you like it?
I do.
You do?
Mmm...
What's it like with her?
It excites you, doesn't it?
Hmm?
How is she?
She likes to play games.
She likes surprises.
Sounds like fun?
Her fun.
Do you see the drawer
beneath the sink?
Yeah.
Open it.
Whatever she needs, I supply.
Whatever Christine wants,
she gets.
She's exactly the same in bed.
But she can be very
generous sometimes.
She gave me
a very beautiful scarf.
She gave you my scarf.
Oh, no!
Oh, yes.
Do you want it back?
No.
It looks better on you. Keep it.
Thank you.
Pleasure.
It's her, isn't it?
Okay, so that takes care
of our current business. Any questions?
Isabelle, I got a memo from New York.
Something about a new research poll
sent your way? Did you get that?
Ah...
Did I?
Yeah, yeah, yeah... yeah.
I got it yesterday. I haven't really
had a chance to look at it, though.
Okay, well let's not fall asleep
at the switch here.
Of course not.
If there are any new developments,
I want to know about them immediately.
Yeah.
Okay?
Thank you everyone.
That's all.
Oh, Isabelle, could you just stay
for a minute, please?
Yeah. Yeah.
Hey.
Are you still mad about London?
No.
Really?
Yeah, no.
I think you are.
And it's driving me crazy because I...
I... I want everything to be okay.
Because I care about you.
You know that?
I, I actually, I love you.
I do.
I do too.
You can't say it.
Why can't you just say it?
When I was six years old...
...my parents bought me and
my twin sister a bike because...
...we liked to share everything.
You have a twin sister?
Hmm.
So we would take turns
riding it to school...
...and Clarissa was so much better
on the bike than I was.
She could pedal standing up and...
...you know, ride no hands.
So one day it was my turn and...
...I was just so determined
that I was gonna show her...
...I could be just as good
as she could.
I started pedalling...
...faster and faster and...
...she had to run like hell
to keep up with me.
And I let go of the handlebars...
...and I felt like I was flying.
And it felt so good.
I just wanted to see myself,
so I looked...
...into the window and I caught
my reflection...
...and then I don't know
what happened.
I swerved into the street and...
...this truck was
coming right at me.
And then I suddenly felt my sister
push me from behind out of the way...
...and then I flew over
the handlebars.
And the last thing I remember...
...was this horrible "thunk".
And I woke up in the hospital...
...and my mother was sobbing.
And I asked her what happened
to Clarissa and she said...
Well, she didn't,
she wouldn't even look at me.
And no one ever said anything,
but I knew
what they were thinking.
That I killed her.
And they never told me that
they loved me ever again.
Oh, Christine...
I love you.
You do?
You're a lovely person.
Dirk.
You wanted me to come?
Here I am.
Hello, Isabelle.
Hello, Dirk.
You Okay?
I'm good.
Oh, you're both so complicated!
DIR'
Really? No' reaHV?
All right, if that's how it is, then
I guess we should get back to work.
Yeah.
Good.
Good.
Isabelle, could you leave us
in private, please?
Absolutely.
Mmh... she's lovely.
Yes, she is.
So, what are we gonna do
about your little Ponzi scheme?
Ponzi scheme?
I told you, I need two or three
months to balance the sums...
...and everything will fall into place.
Well, you have a week.
You're fucking mad, Christine!
It's impossible.
Now time is up.
New York is doing its audit.
There is no way I can have
this kind of exposure.
I can't cover for you anymore.
Christine,
my firm has been working
for you for a long time.
You can cut me some slack.
I wrote up an addendum to
the budgets and it's dated today.
I'm attaching it to the file.
Here, read it.

Yeah.



Okay.



If anybody sees this, I'm ruined.
Pay it back, I'll happily tear it up.
Christine...
...listen.
It's me.
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?
I'm not your little Isabelle.
Oh, god.
Hi.
Did you get my text?
I got it, yes,
but now is not
a good time, please.
What's going on?
I have problems.
Problems.
And Christine, she
won't help me to solve them.
Tell me about it.
I can help you.
You can't!
You can't help me.
You can't.
Talk to me.
Tell me what happened!
It's over.
What?
You and me.
This ends now.
Why?
What did she say, huh?
What did Christine tell you?
What happened in that room?
Talk to me!
You just don't get it, do you?
Christine doesn't give
a shit about us!
She doesn't care.
Don't do this.
Don't call me.
Don't text me.
Go back to work.
Hey.
You're late.
What?
Who?
Who... who's sick?
Your daughter?
No, I didn't know
you had a daughter.
Tomorrow?
How about,
how about this...
How about you call me never!
Dani? Could you
come in for a second?
Mark?
Hi. It's Christine.
Yeah, I know.
It's been a really long time.
Too long. Um...
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Do you want to come over?
You're right. This is crap.
Fuck them.
Let's find out what the world
thinks of my ad my way.
Yes, I love it!
You do. You know
my taste very well.
It's not too noisy?
Okay, good.
Well I'm... yeah!
I want to take it!
I know, I know, Manhattan apartments
are so much more expensive than they...
Ah...
Urn... yeah, so, yeah, okay.
Let's... let's talk in a couple of days.
Okay, all right, bye.
Oh, my god!
Wow, Mark!
Yeah?
Isabelle?
J. J. Koch here.
Am / waking you?
Oh, hi.
No, not at all.
I can 'I belie ve
what' you've done.
I tried to ca/I Chr/lst/ne,
bu! I cou/dn '1' reach her.
Oh, my God. Oh, I'm so sorry.
Christine has nothing to do with it.
It's all my fault.
I just felt that
the new ideas were so...
No, no, it's great'!
It's Wonderful.
You were right
a thousand percent fight.
Do you realize how many times
your ao' has been viewed?
No.
Ten mil/ion,
and it' has only been on
for five hours.
My phone is ringing off the hook.
Oh, my God,
that's, ah... that's great.
Thai's brill/an t.
And guess what? We're
coming to see you tomorrow.
We have to go back to London, so We're
going to slop off and see you on the way.
Soto cut to the chase,
lsabelle's Omniphone ad has gone viral.
They want us to spin off
some print and TV spots!
According to preliminary estimates, we're
talking about over 50 million in billings.
Plus I've got every
jean company on the planet...
...to beg me to represent them.
Well, guys, this is
a total home run.
Okay, thanks a lot.
Isabelle, Christine, I would like
to have a word with you in private.
Nice work, Isabelle.
Thank you.
You are now on our shortlist.
Congratulations on the concept
and the follow through.
Christine, you sure have a nose for
talent. You know how to find them...
...and train them.
About New York,
I don't think this is
really the best time.
We should wait.
Let's talk about it later, okay?
Okay.
Yeah, I'm not really
in any hurry.
I've still got a lot of work
to do here.
Outstanding.
So, Isabelle, I expect you
in New York...
...with the completed campaign
within the month?
Yes.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Both of you.
See you.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Why?
You knew about the memo.
They wanted changes.
I thought they were wrong. So...
I did what had to be done.
Everything happened really fast.
I tried to update you last night,
but you weren't answering your phone.
Just answer the question.
Why?
I watched you.
I I/stenea'.
I learned.
I did exactly what you would do.
There's no back stabbing,
here, Christine.
Its just business!
Well,
there it is then.
Yeah?
Oh, thank G00'!
Thank God you answered!
Ifis me, Isabelle.
I know. What do you want?
Look...
You... you were r/jght.
It's... it's Christine, she...
Look, she forced me
to break it offi okay?
She "forced" you?
Yes, she forced me.
She's fucking dangerous, Isabelle!
You don't understand.
She's screwed up after everything
that happened with her sister.
What? Her sister?
What are you talking about?
Yeah. Her twin sister, Clarissa.
What are you talking about? She
doesn't have a tw/h sister. You see,
this is it, this is what she does!
She's told you some sad story.--
...to gel' your sympathy...
She doesn't have a sister?
No.
- How do you know?
- Because / know her.
I know Christine...
...know what she is' I/ke-
And this is What she does.
She '// say anything to fuck you up.
Please, Isabelle,
don't let her do this.
Don 'f lez' her do this f0 us.
Look...
Can you meet me, can you...
can you see me tonight, please?
I don't know, Dirk.
Oh...
Isabelle, /...
I need you.
I need to see you.
I Want you, Isabelle.
I'm sorry.
Do you understand?
It's hard on me- I'm sorry.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Yeah.
Okay, good.
Good, good, good.
I'll pick you UP-
Okay.
I'll come by the office, 8 o'clock.
Okay.
Hey.
You're late.
And I can't see you.
Do you have your camera on?
Dirk?
Guess again.
It's me.
Are you looking for Dirk?
He's right here.
Don't point that fucking thing at me.
Take it off.
He's a little bit grumpy right now.
I don't know why...
...because we're just having a nice
evening at home watching a movie.
Your movie, actually...
...from London?
Wanna take a look?
Okay...
Fucking Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck.
God.
Oh, fuck me!
Oh...
Fuck!










I w/Y/ never forget that you
humiliate me. And you '// pay for it.

What are you talking about?



Yes, get me a coffee.





We have a little
surprise for you tonight.
An amusing one I hope.
So, what really goes on...
with/n these walls?
Hmm .7
I've put together
a //tt/e reality show.
The not so secret life...
...of the very stressed out
executive.
Their ecstasies, their agonies,
and the lessons to be learned.
An executive meltdown.
Yes, we've all been there,
haven't we?
Now, the trick is
to not succumb to your frustrations.
Take a deep breath. Relax,
move on. Hmm?
Right, Okay.
Next.
Caught in the act!
Now we all need to blow off
a little steam at work.
It's true.
And you both
know who you are-
I suggest next time
you rent a room.
Okay?
Outside the work space.
Thank you.
All right, what's next?
Ouch!
Going toe to toe with
a concrete p/I/ar.
Oooooh!
So, someone's not very happy
with their parking spot.
Isabelle, come on, it's just a joke.
Where is your sense of humour?
0/7, my God!
This really hurt you. Didn't it?
I'm so sorry.
I just thought
we could laugh together.
Yeah!
It's funny.
Hi.
I want to talk to Dr. Katzman please.
Stefan? It's Isabelle James.
I need to come see you.
Come in.
Close the door.
Isabelle, I said I was sorry,
and now this?
What is it?
"I will never forget how you
humiliated me.
"And you will pay for it.
"Vengeance is a dish
best served cold."
I never wrote that.
It's from your computer.
I didn't write it.
That's not very smart, Isabelle.
I never wrote it.
Well, that's going to be hard to believe
after your unfortunate performance.
I never wrote it!
Okay. Fine.
How about I just put it
in a safe place for now?
There.
I feel like things have just gotten
so out of control around here lately.
It's so crazy.
I'm having a small intimate
dinner party on Saturday night.
Just a few close friends and I would
really like it if you would come.
That file you were
telling me about,
Dirk's file?
Bring it to me.


Thank you.
I want to go to the ballet.
"Afternoon Of A Faun".
10 o'clock,
Saturday night.

Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Sure.
Yeah, I'm... I'm coming.




Thank you. Thank you so much.
Thank you,
thank you for coming.
I'll see you out.
Thank you. Take care.
Isabelle...
I'm glad to see you're
wearing the scarf.
Why don't we kiss
and make up? Hmm?
Mmm...

What do you mean?


Don't take that tone with me!
Who do you think you're talking to?
Shut up and go back to work.
Do you think no one can tell?

What you really want.
Her cunt.
Isabelle and I laugh about it
all the time.

Do you think I don't see what's
going on in that dyke brain of yours?
Your jealousy is fucking up
our working relationship...
...and I won't stand for it.
I want you out of here.

I'm not gonna fire you.
You're resigning.
I want your letter on my desk
Monday morning.

Ahhhh!
Well!
I believe I've been
sexually assaulted!

And in the "she said, she said",
who are they going to believe?
Hmm?
Hmm, charming, all of you.
Very charming.
All very wonderfully boring,
all of you!
Especially you!
Oh, you are.
Good night.
Christine...
Hello, Christine. Hmm...
Thank you for
all of your help tonight.
Christine, we need to talk...
I'll see you on Monday.
...you and I.
Thank you, good night.
Good night. Thank you.
Cheerio, all of you.
You are very drunk.
Yes, I am. Let's go inside.
No! Let's not!
Christine...
How did you get here?
I drove here, very fast.
What?
Oh, my God!
Look...
What's wrong with you?
What are you... what's going on?
We need to talk.
That's all.
You made me do...
This is not a time for talking.
You made me do a very
bad thing. A very bad thing.
Yes, okay...
You owe me, Christine.
Yes, yes.
You do not let me down.
Leave the door unlocked,
undress, shower,
blindfold yourself and come
to bed
Let me in, Christine.
Open the door, Christine!
Christine!
Hello?
I'm coming.
Are you down there?
Ah...
Hello.
Inspector Bach,
my colleague.
Are you Isabelle James?
Yes.
Mind if we come in?
Why?
Are you all right?
Are you all right!?
No, no, /'n7 not all ﬂight'.
I took some sleeping pills.
I can't sleep.
Do you know that
Christine Stanford was murdered,
her throat slashed in her home,
Saturday night?
Do you recognise this?
Do you recognise this?
It was written on your computer.
Didn't the victim
recently humiliate you...
...in front of your staff?
Miss James!
We found a piece of mater...
Miss James!
I'm here.
We found a piece of material in the victim's
hand which appears to come from a scarf,
identical to the one...
...you are wearing here.
Can you explain that?
Where were you Saturday night, between
the hours of 11:30 p.m. and 1AM?
The ballet.
Where?
At the ballet.
Hmm, at the ballet?
Were you alone?
Yes.
Did anyone see you
or recognise you?
Why would anyone
recognise me?
Sometimes you see people... you talk
to someone... they might remember...
Remember what?
Remember you!
You would have an alibi, which means
you didn't kill Christine Standford.
"Kill Christine"?
Ah... I could...
I would never...
If you have a lawyer,
it's a good time to call him.

Lab analysis has confirmed
that the scarf fibres match...
...the ones you were seen wearing.
In conclusion, you are going to be
indicted for 1st degree murder.
Isabelle...
Isabelle, are you all right?
Could we get her
some water, please?
Miss James?
Miss James!
Would you like us
to take a break?
Do you need a doctor?
No.
Yes!
I believe my client's present condition...
We're fine. Then let's do this quickly.
By staging the crime scene
to simulate a robbery,
you have aggravated
the circumstances of your crime.
So, we are now dealing
with premeditated murder.
Why don't you just confess...
...and save us all
a lot of time and money?
What?!
Hold on! You have some fibres that match
a picture of a scarf my client was wearing.
How many other real scarves
would they match?
And what about the DNA evidence?
Has any of my client's DNA...
actually been found on the victim?
That evidence is still being processed.
Let me know when you come up with
something that will stand up in court.
Until then, my client isn't...
Did you kill Christine Stanford?
She doesn't have to answer that.
Don't answer that.
Was it you?
This is, please, this is outrageous!
Did you kill her?
Would you stop harassing her!
Yes, yes, yes, yes,
I must have!
Please, careful. Isabelle,
think about what you're saying.
What do you mean by,
"you must have"? Did you do it?
Was it you?
Isabelle, don't answer that!
Are you confessing to this? How could she?
She didn't do it!
Are you confessing to this?
Yes, I confess.




Mmm...
What about the DNA evidence?
By staging the crime scene...
Isabelle- - - are you all right?
Did you kill Christine Stanford?
She doesn't have to answer that.
Did you do it?
0m you do it?
No, she d/dnZ/
Did you k/I/ her?
A TTORNE YCS' VOICE]
Prosecutor, my client's mental state...
Counsel/or,
your client has just confessed to murder.
Yes, / confess.
I want to see my attorney.
I didn't kill Christine.
You're withdrawing your confession?
Yes.
I am innocent.
I didn't do it.
Then why did you confess?
I don't know...
I was so tired, so fucked up
by all those pills...
I would have confessed to anything.
We've got to speak
to the prosecutor, immediately.
It looks like the same material.
You're right.
But my scarf isn't torn.
Then where is it?
I don't know exactly,
somewhere in my apartment.
We've already searched your apartment
thoroughly and we found nothing.
You have to look again.
I know it's there!
Look, my client has no reason
to lie about this.
Either she has an identical
scarf or she doesn't.
Yes.
All right, I think you've
wasted enough of my time.
- Oh, please!
- Wait a minute! I didn't do it!
Why would I have killed
Christine?
Because you had motive, and
a very powerful one. Vengeance!
I never wrote that! Never!
And even if I did, killing her
after writing that would be insane!
Christine must have sent
this from my computer to...
Oh, my God...
Look at the date.
It was sent the day before
the company reception.
Do you see?
The day before she did that
terrible thing to me.
It doesn't make any sense.
I never wrote that!
My career was taking off
and Christine couldn't stand it.
She hated me.
Yes, she tried to destroy her.
We have statements from several of the
executives close to my client and the victim.
They all confirm that my client
was falling apart...
...as a direct result of
Christine Standford's harassment.
Are you insane?
Is that your defence?
Save your pleas of mitigating
circumstances for the judge!
I'm only interested in evidence.
Which we tried to deliver here.
This is n01' evidence.
Look!
I was never at Christine's
house! I was at the ballet!
Yes, that's what you say.
I spoke to an usher.
At the ballet.
He had grey curly hair.
He was German. His
English was quite bad. He...
He'd remember me.
My client was wrongly accused.
She has a confirmed alibi. There is
no physical evidence against her,
no DNA found
at the scene. Nothing.
What about the piece of scarf
found in the victim's hand?
It's not mine.
So you still claim you have
an identical scarf?
Yes, exactly the same scarf, and if we
could find it, it wouldn't have a tear.
May I make a request?
Please, go ahead.
Allow my client to accompany the
police officers that look for the scarf?
What is this?
Christine found that
Dirk... er, Mister Harriman...
...attempted to conceal a diversion
of a very large sum of money...
...in connection with a deal.
How much?
I don't know exactly.
It seems to be over 5 million Euros.
He embezzled 5 millions Euros and
Christine was going to expose him?
Why were you hiding the evidence?
Well, he was a friend and he said
that if he just had some more time...
...he could put the money back. So
you snatched the file and hid it?
Didn't you realize that
this is a motive for murder?
Oh, no. No... Dirk would never
do anything like that!
So time's up. Let's go.
Oh, no, just wait!
Can I have a look, please?
I keep my scarf in one of those drawers
and sometimes things fall behind.
Please, can I have a look,
please, please, please?
Qkay- Thank you.
Leave hera/one.
Thank you.
Oh, it's got to be there!
Isabelle...
Isabelle, it's finished. Let's go.
No! It's supposed to be here!
It's got to be here!
No, please! Please!
Just give me
one more minute, please!
Please, give me
one more minute! No!
I didn't do it...


You know my scarf.
It's somewhere in my flat.
You've got to find it.









Mr. Harriman?
Yes, what is this?
Inspector Bach.
The prosecutor has filed charges
against you for embezzlement.
We are to immediately
proceed with proactive searches.
We'll first search this vehicle,
then your residence.
You're out of your mind.
The prosecutor will explain
everything when you see him.
Did you try to break into Christine
Standford's house the night of her murder?
No, absolutely not.
Do you deny being there?
No.
Were you a guest?
Yes, I was.
No, actually I arrived late.
When did you arrive?
I can't remember.
You can't remember?
No.
Then why...
I can't remember.
Is this yours?
That was my scarf... yes.
Was?
Was.
If that's Christine Standford's
blood on there...
Pack up.
Look, this is ridiculous!
You embezzled money
from the company.
She was going to turn you in.
You're not just a crook,
Mister Harriman, but a murderer.
I want to see my lawyer.
I'll not say another word until I do.
Can you believe it?
So, he goes out and he buys
a bunch of roses.

Yes, and then he shows up
on my door step to apologize!
I know!
He was red in the face and
sweating all over my carpet.
And he was so sorry
for locking me up!

A No!
Re YO“ Crazy? No!
I just, um... smiled sweetly...
...and I took his cheap roses
and his lame excuses...
...and I threw them in the trash.


Yeah, but I'm not a murderess.

Dani...
...I know what you did for me.

Yes, of course.
Shall we have a look at 26 again?

Well...
I think they're okay, but
they're not good enough.
What do you think?
Whoa, Dani!
That kiss never happened, ok?


Wow, that's a problem.

Oh, my, God, Dani,
you're serious!


No, no Dani, no! What's wrong
with you? No, I don't love you.


Dani, please, you know what... I think
we've been drinking too much.
I'll just make us some
espresso, I'll call you a cab.
You can get home, you can have
a good night's sleep...
...and then we'll talk
tomorrow. Okay?


Please...

Please, Dani, please stop it! You're
pathetic now! Please, please.
Yes.

And I'm grateful, okay.
Thank you.

Here's your espresso.
Please sit down, sober up.
I'll call you a taxi, okay?
Hello, I need e cab-.





















Christine!
Christine!
Let me in, Christine!
Christine!

Yes, I confess.



Except...



Untraceable?



What do you want?

What do you want?









I never had the chance
to apologise to her.
Yeah?
