Failed in committing suicide also.
Use some energy man.
Hey Laxmi.
What do you think?
Heard the area is on high alert today.
Might have to call it a night?
This is Putul.
New entry.
Teach her the ropes of the business.
She's your new tenant.
Charge her for the bed every month.
A.T...
Start your rickshaw.
Mustard oil,
lipstick
and painted nails.
What a combination!
Jasmine and mustard oil.
I use a mixture of both oils every day.
You should also try it.
Trust me,
your scanty parts will also fill up.
Come with me.
Let's go home. No business tonight.
This is temporary.
Start looking for a different house.
I prefer to live alone.
But I love company.
Nonetheless, I'll find a different place.
Thank you.
How much money do you have on you?
Two thousand five hundred rupees.
Two thousand five hundred rupees?
That's all?
Thanks a ton Mhatre sir!
No, I'm not in the mood.
Hey!
No smoking in the house!
God!
What the hell?
Asshole...
Get away you dumbfuck.
It's quite hot today.
-I have completed my time.
-Come!
That mad woman had exiled me for 12 years
near Bakulapuri, Ahmedabad.
It's a crime to save anybody's life here.
In that case, Papa, send me away.
Are we clear?
Are you done? Shall we go?
Let's go.
Hello Monu.
How are you?
I'm going for my first day of work here.
Overhyped Mumbai and its overhyped food.
They add potato cutlet to bread
and call it Vada Pav.
I'm still fond of the cutlets
from Pachus shop from Kolkata.
Believe me, there is nothing special here.
Half of the time
-we're stuck in a jam here.
-Listen.
Listen, I'll call you later.
At work now.
Goodnight.
Are you done? Give me your phone.
He is A.T... A.T.
He'll collect our money from the customers
and if there's a problem,
he'll follow the customer's car also.
This is his number.
And if the customer doesn't drop us back,
he can pick us up also.
Meaning pimp cum watchman.
Double role.
-What did you just say?
-Nothing, let it go, you keep driving.
-What did you say?
-You...
have a very handsome face.
Did you ever try acting in Bollywood?
I give addiction sometimes,
at Chabra's Casting place.
Addiction?
You don't know addiction?
We have to try out the scene
in front of the camera
to bag the role in a film.
Everyone has to do it,
even big stars like Amitabh Bachchan.
-For the hero's role?
-No, no, not the hero.
Okay, understood.
Hero's friend, brother.
Yes, boyfriend's role as well.
We are always at the top!
So your parents had lots of kids?
No, I'm a single child, one man army.
So why were they so lazy in naming you?
Just A.T?
Take your feet off!
-Just take them off!
-I'll tell her, don't worry.
-Get out of my rickshaw!
-Take your feet off.
You drive please.
Don't act too smart.
Done with your drama?
Now...
Listen.
Darkness is our ally.
So all the dark by-lanes are our spots.
It keeps the customers on bikes happy.
So the police
won't bother us in these by-lanes?
What?
So the police
won't bother us in these by-lanes?
We have an arrangement with them?
Yes, we have an arrangement.
But they raid us sometimes.
Otherwise, they'll have nothing to show
in their quarterly report.
So they'll take a cut from us
and also arrest us?
What bullshit is this!
Where have you come from?
This is a man's world.
Keep that in your mind.
Get down now, we have arrived.
A.T...
The room charges are 200 rupees per hour.
You know how to moan right?
He'll cum faster if you moan.
This is our trick.
Touching you with clothes on is free.
From inside the top, it's 200 rupees and
to remove the top it's 200 rupees more.
Okay boss.
Meet me alone sometime...
Bloody dog! Asshole!
Stop now!
-Let's leave!
-She's quite spicy Laxmi, I love it!
-Come on, let's go.
-Wow, amazing!
Move...
have you lost it?
Huh?
Welcome, Queen Laxmi Bai.
All hail Laxmi Bai!
Tell me, what would you like to have?
Tea, coffee?
-Coffee is fine.
-Coffee it is then.
I just remembered,
I have something very important
to share with you.
-What?
-Your friend Manda
recently bought a phone
worth 30,000 rupees.
She's earning more than you
despite being of your age.
Mangatram,
stop this habit of spreading rumours.
Stop writing stories.
Do your work, make coffee for me.
-Yes, I was just casually saying.
-Yes,
-I know your idea of casually.
-Listen,
that hotel manager
will always take his share?
Yes.
Then how can he misbehave?
Who do you think you are?
What world do you live in?
Men run this world.
They'll touch us, screw us, fuck us.
Men are the building
and we, women are its foundation.
All right! Understood,
don't lose your temper.
-Thank You!
-Welcome!
-Horrible coffee you've made.
-Should I make another one?
Yes try making a nice one this time.
And make it fast.
How are you?
I'm Tsamchoe.
Are you the new girl?
I'm Putul.
Want to see our version of heaven?
Yes.
She says she has only 2500 rupees
and look at her expenses.
Bitch!
Oh my god! This is crazy!
What is this?
All kinds of cigarettes
are available here.
-This is a super strong cigar.
-Woah!
This is the one they smoke in films!
This shop already existed,
I didn't create it.
Thank you!
Sir, this is...
Bengali bombshell.
Sir, she's with us.
Meet soon.
Let's go.
This asshole...
changed his name from Yadav to More
to become a cop under the reserved quota.
Now...
you have a problem with the police also?
No teacher. Sorry teacher.
Now watch and learn
how to get a customer's attention.
How to do customer fishing. See.
When a car starts approaching us,
just look away...
Where?
And act disinterested.
Just as you saw the police
doing with me right now.
Just keep looking away.
Play with your phone, twirl your hair,
make them feel
that you are not interested.
Once you realize
that the customer is hooked,
you stay here and let me talk.
As I talk,
you slowly walk over to the car
so the customer can see your body better.
While they do that,
you should look into the back of the car
to see if there are any more men
in hiding.
Check properly
because if more men appear
once you're inside the car then,
you're screwed.
Our safety is our responsibility.
Understood
but I thought that
A.T. is responsible for our safety.
This is how it is right?
Can you even understand what I'm saying?
Sorry...
Is she new?
Never seen her around here.
How much for a short bit of time?
Yes, her first day.
Seven hundred for her.
Three hundred for the room.
No bargain.
I'm brand new.
Sealed pack.
Let's go?
Bitch!
Sealed pack!
See you soon darling.
I'm busy on Monday.
Let's keep in touch. Bye bye.
Everyone says women love to talk.
They've clearly not given men a chance.
-Non stop talking.
-Alright, alright,
no need to show off.
-Run!
-Raid!
Come on, run fast!
Come on, hurry up, everyone in the car.
-Come on, sir!
-Hurry!
Come on get into the car.
You need a special invitation?
Keep moving.
-Keep moving!
-Keep moving!
Sir, no space in this one now.
What the hell!
-Get her in the other car.
-Okay, sir.
Come here.
Why are you standing here?
Hey!
You!
Hi!
I'm Shaari...
Sharanya!
Come with me.
Need to talk about something personal.
Say what you want to
in front of everyone, you pimp!
Who did you call a pimp?
Come with me.
-Come with me.
-Leave me.
Come on.
Hey!
Hey! Shut up and sit.
Leave me, you asshole.
-You went for a routine round?
-Should I help you with that?
Just answer my question,
you raided the street?
It was due, sir.
It has been a while since the last raid.
Come with me.
You need to make a report.
Let the girls go for now.
-Understood?
-Yes, sir.
See you around.
Come on.
-Let's leave now. Get up and move.
-Let's go.
Let's go.
It's been hardly a day
and she's already trying
to change the system. Idiot.
You son of a bitch!
Where are you taking me?
Take it to the curb.
Just stop the car!
Didn't you hear me, you pimp!
Stop the car now!
Son of a swine!
Don't move!
Son of a swine!
The water is blue today.
The water is blue today.
What?
Take out the phone.
Blue.
Who is it?
-Are you chasing a new girl?
-Why do you care?
How does it concern you?
-What? Sisterfucker.
-Putul...
-Please leave him...
-Putul, what are you doing?
Putul Let go off him!
What the hell are you doing?
-Show us your phone!
-What are you doing!
-Tell her please.
-Putul, let go of him.
-Just do as I say.
-Are you mad?
-Taking it out.
-Bastard.
-Fine!
-Take your phone out!
I'm taking out my phone.
Take your phone out
and show it to everyone.
What is there to show?
Show everyone
how many times I've called you!
Someone please tell her
not to scar my face!!
-Just leave him for now. Please!
-I called him again and again and again.
And he heard the phone ringing
but he didn't pick up my call.
Just look at his phone. Look!
-Okay but leave...
-I had to run for my life!
My life could have been in danger.
-Oh god, his face will get fucked.
-You dumbfuck.
I'll get hurt permanently!
-Please!
-You asshole,
you live on our money,
and you fuck around with us only.
If this happens again,
I'll stick this knife so far up your ass
that you'll walk around
like a plucked chicken
for the rest of your life.
You leave him.
Let's solve it by talking about it.
This is no way to deal with things.
Come on, step back.
You leave now. Just move,
I'll deal with her, you move.
-But I'll teach you a lesson.
-Yes you leave, I'll handle her.
Yes, I'll leave. Yeah!
Have you lost your mind?
He should have received her call!
What he did was wrong!
-Come on, let's leave.
-No point waiting here.
-Come on, let's leave.
-She thinks she's the smartest.
When Mhatre will come down
to teach her a lesson,
then she'll understand.
Ya'll leave.
Just take different rickshaws
and head home.
It's the end of business for tonight.
-Leave me!
-Shut up!
Leave me, you asshole!
Sir, this is my house.
-You dog!
-Please don't bring all this into my home.
You dog!
This bastard...
dared to threaten my man.
One doesn't go against their own people
in their own homes
Because then there's no difference
between family and strangers.
Move your hand!
Let me go!
You'll threaten me?
Want to try it again?
Let's leave. Leave!
Okay?
Thank you, sir.
You can deal with this
the way you want tomorrow, outside.
We're going to let her get away with this?
Let's go now.
Leave.
You whore!
Don't give me that look
or else I'll break your head.
If you create any more nuisance,
I'll directly involve Shinde sir.
Laxmi knows what it means to involve him.
Right Laxmi?
You've experienced it,
haven't you?
Tell this whore also.
Thank you!
-Hello!
-How much?
Is he a foreigner?
Where are you from?
Australia.
Name?
Peter Hibberd.
What are you doing in Mumbai?
Advertising.
Why India?
My father was Indian.
-Grandfather?
-Yes, grandfather.
Now give me a kiss.
Real kiss, come on.
You dumbfuck!
Shut up!
No!
Run you idiot! You dog.
Run you dumbfuck! Run!
Come on, run!
Run you idiot! Run! Dumbfuck, run.
Run you idiot!
Run, run you dumbfuck, run.
Dumbfuck! Asshole.
What's wrong?
-Run!
-Didn't take your medicine?
Run, you idiot!
Let's go, skinny man!
Dumbfuck!
Hey! Should I light a cigarette for you?
Run, you idiot! Run! Dumbfuck!
-Run.
-Oh Donald Trump!
-Let me help you, come in the auto.
-Why don't you run now?
-What the hell did she do?
-Let me save you.
Check your groin to see if all is well.
Yes, run away.
Yes, run away.
If you try to force yourself on women,
this is what the consequence will be.
This is it.
Now she's finished.
-Come with me.
-Be careful.
You want me to be careful?
Now this Diwali gun's firecracker
is going to get permanently extinguished.
Get us into more of a mess now!
Idiot!
Quickly give me a hand job
or I can do lot more than that.
You don't know me yet.
I'm not going to do anything for you,
you asshole.
Dumbfuck.
You motherfucking whore!
You'll keep abusing me?
Listen, I'm telling you for the last time.
Just do the hand job.
It'll be fun, trust me. Just try it.
Do whatever the hell you want
to do yourself, you pimp!
You can't look at my face.
You want to be a dog from behind.
-Dog? A dog?
-Be a dog.
Be a Dog.
So you finally reveal your true identity!
A dog.
Dumbfuck...
You all go home now.
We'll send her later.
Move, come on move.
Come on, leave, move. Leave!
Fucking animal. Dumbfuck.
There's no respect for me in Mumbai.
Hey!
I may die a dog's death.
But I won't live a dog's life.
Brother, you can question any girl
in the town about my manhood,
the reports won't disappoint you...
Any idea what's gotten into him?
Sister,
-Sharanya told me this.
-What?
Forget about A.T.
All the customers
have started behaving themselves,
everyone's talking nicely.
-No one's fooling around.
-Really?
Nobody is talking
about what happened to Putul,
but instead what she did to that man.
Sister, you know everyone
calls her Tikli now.
What?
Oh come on, don't you remember?
You yourself gave her that name
the other day.
Let's go to work.
How are you Tikli?
Tikli?
Yes, your new name.
All the girls decided to call you that.
Sister...
Can I ask you something?
Go ahead, ask.
Why do we allow men
to take advantage of us?
We earn
and they make a cut out of our money.
Oh my god, the same topic again.
Will you stop repeating
yourself like a record?
This is a man's world.
Please understand! Idiot.
This is where you're wrong.
This is not a man's world.
This is our work, not theirs.
This is our business. Not theirs.
Our body
and the dirty feeling with
which we return home every night,
is also ours.
The pain, the discomfort, it's all ours.
So then how is it their world?
Why can't we make our own system, Laxmi?
We'll reap what we sow. Simple.
I thought you'd become sensible by now
but I was wrong.
Just stay away from me from now on.
That's it.
Shit!
Bloody dog, just pick up!
Open the door.
-Sir...
-Get out of the car.
Sit inside.
Be comfortable.
-Come on...
-Come on...
No!
-Hold her.
-No, sir.
-Hold her.
-No! No sir, no, sir.
No! No, sir. Not again.
I'll kill you.
Back off or I'll kill you, you asshole.
I'll kill you. Back off or I'll kill you.
You fucking dog.
-Follow her man!
-Fuck that! Let's find the key first.
Leave her, find the key first!
Cheetah's speed,
a hawk's vision,
and Bajirao's sword,
no not the sword.
One should never doubt on these.
It could outwit anyone.
Hello Mhatre sir.
You'll live for a 100 years.
I was going to call you.
What a brilliant job you've done sir.
Absolutely brilliant.
And the police
has also done our work very well.
In a good way,
they've taught Putul her lesson very well.
They've taught Putul
her lesson very well...
That whore
has finally understood her place.
Remember how you did the same with Laxmi?
Yes?
Where are you?
Okay, I'll be there.
Okay dear.
Good afternoon.
Oh my god!
What happened?
Is everything all right?
What did you say earlier?
Our own system?
Tell me, how do you think
we'll make our own system?
To be honest,
-I haven't thought it through yet.
-Then start thinking.
It's time to seriously think about it.
So you accept that I was right earlier?
I don't know about being right,
but you're definitely not wrong.
See Tikli, right now this is your fight.
But I've understood that in this fight,
I'm on your side
and not theirs.
Come on, great.
Great.
At least
we have the right beginning to this.
Hey Monu, tell me.
Nothing, I'm just at home...
drinking.
Can I call you tomorrow? Okay, bye.
What's with so much red?
It's the colour of revolution.
So tell us, Laxmi.
Why this sudden secret meeting
in the dead of the night?
Wow.
Now I understand.
This is Tikli's rally.
Come on, everyone speak up,
who'll vote for Tikli?
I think everyone should vote for her.
Today I've come to talk
about something very serious.
There you go!
The speech has finally begun.
Assholes.
You're an asshole. Yes, you as well.
We are all big brainless assholes.
Everyday, Mhatre and his men,
the policemen are openly fucking us over.
Every man in the system
has his hands inside our skirts.
Means every man in this system
has their hands up our skirts
and we are not doing anything about it.
Except sitting quietly.
We're all assholes.
What is our basic need?
Safety and protection.
Just think.
The fears are ours,
so is the way we deal with them.
That dirty feeling we have every night.
All ours?
The money is fucking ours.
But are we getting safety?
And how many times
have we actually been protected?
These assholes take money from us
and then misbehave with us.
But all of us are quiet.
Why haven't we made our own system yet,
where we get to keep the money we earn?
She's completely gone mad.
Absolutely lost it.
If Mhatre sir comes to know about this,
he'll skin us all.
Come on, let's get back to work.
You'll go against your own masters?
She's not finished.
Let her finish saying what she wants to
and then you do whatever you want to.
Simple.
Okay, I'm a new entrant, correct?
But Laxmi here is an old timer, right?
And she also thinks I'm right.
Our own system!
Unless we try, we'll never know.
We'll make our own system
and actually be safe.
Plus we'll earn more money.
Just think about
how many of you support your families,
back home, with that money. Just think.
Laxmi, Mhatre sir is our provider.
He's done so much for you and yet,
you'll go against him?
This is the real problem.
Mhatre, since the beginning has been
against us.
We just took time to realize that.
It's difficult,
but I've finally understood.
We earn, we eat!
Simple.
You will die
and get us all killed.
Simple.
She's gone completely mad!
Let's leave!
Come on, let's go!
What's the plan?
First of all, we'll need to find someone
in the police department
who would add our weekly money
cut to the larger pool?
The police can't know we're doing this.
We need to get this done fast!
I'm sure Manda would've already
informed Mhatre, that bitch!
And here Manda hits a sixer, that bitch!
You bitch!
You're a new entrant here and you think
you can log heads with Mhatre?
You bitch!
Hey... Hey.
Please sir.
Laxmi!
Laxmi.
I had heard of it
and today I witnessed it.
What's going on, Laxmi?
-I do so much for you all...
-That's the problem.
That you do nothing for us Mhatre sir.
You had ordered the police guy
to rape her in the police station.
Isn't that right?
I heard it from your idiot's mouth.
-What a liar!
-Hey.
-Hey.
-Asshole.
We'll solve this.
Let's go now. Just leave, man!
-Let's leave.
-Go!
Go away!
Go, asshole!
Let's go!
Let's go!
How are you whistling so calmly?
Today they twisted our arms,
tomorrow they'll dare to pee on our heads.
I say we call our boys now
and finish these girls.
Hey.
Mr. Angry Young Man.
Don't take more stress now.
They are also trying to show pride
by not giving the weekly cut.
The police will handle them
in their style.
If we do something and things get worse,
Shinde sir will blame us.
We'll just sit in the stadium,
have popcorn and enjoy the game.
Enjoy the situation.
Dilip Deshpande.
A constable for the last 20 years.
Money doesn't affect him.
But...
Still DSP?
One Antiquity Blue. Ninety milliliters.
We've come here to become your friends.
Friends?
What's going on here?
Sir, we just want you
to drink Antiquity every day.
Sir, you just take the weekly cut from us
and add that money with Mhatre's money
in the police station.
We take responsibility
of getting you your Antiquity every day.
How much ever you want.
All the time.
Antiquity Blue.
A whisky with a soul, sir. Soul.
What a great night we had today.
Just like the film Rang De Basanti.
You remember
how Rang de Basanti ends right?
Your sense of humor...
is quite nice.
Come, today two friends...
will drink rum together.
We are not friends, Tikli.
We live together.
We work together.
That's it. I'm not a friendly type
like you, understood?
And in this revolution,
I'm standing right behind you
because you're right.
But this is your revolution,
not mine.
A bomb without a switch!
Keeps lecturing me on small things.
Dear roommate madam.
I have a small request.
Please don't say this
in front of the other girls.
We all need to look united.
Okay.
I've paid half the rent.
Okay sisters, listen up.
Until yesterday, all the men knew
that Mhatre is protecting us.
Now all of them know we're alone.
So from tonight,
no girl will go alone with the customer.
Another girl will always accompany her.
But why will the customer agree?
How will this work? She's watching us.
How will this work? She's watching us.
This is how.
You can watch her and touch me.
Hi sexy. Shall we go?
-Let's go.
-Hey handsome.
Seeing you after so long.
You look dashing.
How do I look?
Hey!
Have you lost it?
You know you have to charge extra
to remove the top.
Oh Laxmi,
we need to make regular customers
really fast now.
So we need to do things
which others won't do.
We should have the best reputation.
Simple!
Extra smart!
Come on, let's leave fast.
You can write later.
Take it!
There's a special rate for you.
-What?
-Special rate 600 rupees.
But it was 200 until yesterday?
Until yesterday,
you had someone looking over you .
Keep it.
Lovely Laxmi.
-Chocolate?
-Yes, of course take it.
Keep it.
Let's go.
That's it!
What's up?
Mind blowing news.
Customers haven't reduced at all.
All are the same.
Absolutely correct!
But the hotel manager
is charging us 600 rupees now.
Bloody idiot.
We'll have to find a solution to this.
-He's one son of a bitch!
-Son of a bitch!
Bastard!
Yes we want.
You want to go for another round?
How will it happen again so soon?
Challenge?
Sure.
Come on, pay up 1000 rupees.
One thousand rupees?
Hero,
where else will you get
such an experience?
Double benefit, double charge.
There you go.
This Mumbai city is also a woman like us.
Suppressed...
with the pressure of the entire world.
She sells herself and her kids
and everyone just
eats out of her earnings.
The people that she considers her own
are the ones who finally destroy her.
A million houses,
thousands in each house
and their big dreams,
and the burden of that...
is on Mumbai.
Hey.
Drink?
No.
Can I tell you something honestly?
My father also died this way.
Meaning my father actually passed away
because of this.
Heavy drinking.
Because of rum.
If you want, I can change the drink.
That's not necessary.
You drink.
I won't.
Tell me something.
Who is Monu?
Monu is my brother.
He misses me every day.
He's the closest to me...
in the entire world.
He knows I live alone here
so he calls every day to check up on me.
Are you a single child?
One hundred percent.
Now listen,
we need to increase the members
in our gang quickly.
Think up a plan for that.
I have a plan.
What?
But this time,
you'll have to take the lead.
Why?
Because the girls need to feel
that you are contributing too.
Okay, tell me what the plan is.
Mangatram Pachauri.
Mangatram Pachauri?
You all remember what to do right?
Pach Pach sir...
Do you have Marlboro?
Marlboro?
Changed your brand?
No Gold Flake?
-How many?
-One packet.
Full packet?
Really?
Let's take a selfie?
And Horlicks for everyone, on me.
Everyone get away from the cycle.
And I don't have so much change.
Hey Uncle...
Can't you all stand still
without making a mess?
Hold on, I am giving you your silly Boro.
Uncle, all our lives,
we've been indebted to you.
Deduct the amount
from my note and keep the rest.
Keep the rest? Really?
Full packet,
Horlicks is on the house.
Looks like someone's won the lottery?
This is all because of Queen Tikli.
Why isn't she on a spending spree then?
She's buying cigarette cartons in bulk.
That also from that big shot
outside the Basti.
What an idea!
Pachauri Bulletin.
Stop the car.
Can you both handle the two of us?
Sir, everybody offers two on two.
We offer you three for two.
Wow, a whore who writes dialogues.
Three thousand rupees for three girls.
I'll give you 4000.
There you go.
We're three men,
not two.
Don't you want to meet the third one?
Why?
What happened? Lost your voice?
Get out of the car.
Get out!
Move!
-This is on behalf of Mhatre sir.
-He sends his regards.
Sir...
Sir...
If you're going to kill us together,
then fuck us together as well.
-Catch them now!
-Run, just run!
-Catch them.
-Run.
-Just run.
-Follow them now!
Hey!
Sharanya?
I tried calling her.
Her phone's been dead since evening.
I'll call Tsamchoe.
She stays nearby, she can go check on her.
Tsamchoe's message.
She says...
Sharanya is okay.
They were able to catch hold of her
but she escaped again.
She's a bit hurt.
Bloody assholes.
This security issue has become serious.
We'll have to find a solution to it soon.
Your revolution.
You think.
That's really the limit, Laxmi.
I swear, it's the limit.
What is Amboli?
Amboli is Andheri's cousin.
But Amboli's father
doesn't earn as much as Andheri's father.
So when both go to a restaurant,
Amboli can't order what Andheri can.
Understood?
How are you?
-Laxmi, I want to show you something.
-What?
What is it?
How are you?
Hold this.
Look at this.
Hey!
Psycho!
Are you mad? What is this?
Don't worry.
I punched one guy really hard.
And pushed the other one in a manhole.
-And then you took a photo of him?
-Yes.
That's how I got stuck.
I stopped to take a photo
and just then, the other guy hit me...
from behind.
I'm going to kill that Mhatre.
It's a good thing
she's not in the hospital.
Otherwise, Laxmi couldn't have visited.
Hey, shut up!
-There's nothing.
-Oh, didn't she tell you?
-It's nothing man.
-Laxmi faints the moment
she steps into a hospital.
-Really?
-It's not a big deal.
Shut up you guys!
What?
Okay, we have some amazing news.
Tell them.
Three more girls want to join our gang.
Really?
That's good news.
Yes, good news,
but what are we going to do
about Mhatre's goons?
I want to break their bones!
Mhatre will himself save us from Mhatre.
-Ask me how.
-How?
A few years ago,
Mhatre's wife had an affair with someone.
So to spy on her, Mhatre had something
installed on his as well as her phone.
-What is it called?
-I know! It's an app.
We can connect two phones with each other.
And we'll make our own security system.
We'll call them "The Pigeon Department".
I gave you the idea.
It's your job to convince him.
-Atul brother.
-Yes.
-How are you?
-All good.
What kind of spectacles
are you wearing? No glass?
What kind of a strange hairdo is this?
-It's the latest style.
-This is my latest style.
Okay listen, about your scooter...
-Yes?
-Do you use it all day?
No, I just use it to travel
to and fro from home.
Yes but sometimes, the boys take it
to roam around with girlfriends.
That's it.
So can we rent your scooter?
See, you also go home
at the same time as us,
around 2:00 to 3:00 a.m.
And we can pay you for it.
But what will you do with it?
You know Tsamchoe right?
Her sister got a job at the call centre.
So we need it to pick her up
and drop her off.
I've heard all about it.
You people have started a new business...
Am I right?
You all have money for the petrol?
Yes.
Take the scooter. I don't need any rent.
Just return it back safely at night.
Here!
Thank you Atul brother.
Thank you!
One of you knows how to ride right?
Tikli?
I can ride.
-That's good.
-Thank you.
Be careful Laxmi.
Come on, let's go.
You ride.
You don't know how to ride, do you?
It's your turn to be Aamir Khan now.
-Dhoom 4.
-I knew.
You don't know how to ride. You sit.
Sit now and don't be a nuisance.
This friendship...
We will never break
-I will take my last breath...
-Oh god,
-But I'll never leave your side
-don't move so much, little Elvis.
Are you done having fun?
-Will you listen to me now?
-Sure, tell me.
We need to admit Rekha and Khairunnisa
in our team at the earliest.
Understood?
"Tikli and Laxmi Bomb Gang,"
Pigeon Department.
Sit carefully.
Two thousand five hundred
for the two of us.
What's this?
What you're doing isn't right.
Hey, let's go...
-Come on...
-Hey! look at this.
Fucking whore... You want revolution?
-I'll teach you how to do revolution.
-Leave...
-Brother, I really need to pee...
-Fuck off, you fucker!
Let us go, why're you doing this to us!
Leave... Leave us.
-Why are you doing this to us?
-Shut up bitch!
Shut up!
-Leave... Just leave us.
-Don't talk much.
-Leave... Just leave us.
-Don't talk much bitch.
-Fucking bitch!
-Sisterfucker!
How the fuck did they know where we are?
You fucking asshole!
I'll teach you to be a dick!
Bitch!
Sisterfucker!
Haven't found your gun yet?
Where do you think you're going?
What were you saying?
Show me your manhood now you bastard!
Bastard.
This Pigeon Department idea
was pretty cool.
It was a raging success.
The parrot sings its own praises.
What?
You don't have
a single word of praise ever,
so I thought I'd do the honours myself.
I have to deal with it at night anyway,
may as well be a part of it now.
Is it very old?
How old is that?
Older than you for sure.
It's an antique piece.
It was my grandmother's.
A family heirloom for three generations...
Last month, someone offered me
500,000 rupees for it...
I didn't sell it.
It's the only symbol left
of my family.
Someone would think we're friends...
Friends!
What world are you kids living in?
There's no security problem!
That Tikli takes care of the entire gang.
Really?
-How's that possible?
-How?
-Come. I'll tell you, come.
-What are you going to tell us?
Come along.
Come on girls.
-Come!
-Listen to what he says.
Come!
What did you buy this time?
What did you buy this time?
This time?
I didn't mean it like that.
-I've got something for you too.
-What?
Phone?
Tikli have you lost it?
Why did you waste money on me?
Don't worry, I'll set up your Facebook
and WhatsApp accounts now.
I don't want this Facebook, WhatsApp.
Another headache.
And this is...
what I bought for myself.
Tikli.
-Tikli.
-Isn't it beautiful?
Don't you think
you should save some money?
Put on!
What for?
See, we've just started our business.
And we have a long way ahead
and we'll need a lot
of money along the way.
Laxmi, I've had very little money in life.
And I like to enjoy my money.
Look, you like to save your money.
Have I ever asked, why are you so miserly?
You save, I spend.
-Different natures.
-It's not about our nature, Tikli.
We all should save money right now!
You'll never get gold in your life.
Please try and understand.
You'll live a dog's life,
you'll die a dog's death.
What!
Look, Laxmi.
My body, my hard work and my money.
I'll do as I please.
I'll shove it up my ass
or burn it if I want to.
-Hello, sir.
-Come sit.
How was your holiday?
Fantastic, absolutely brilliant!
Discovery.
All okay here?
How can things be okay here?
Sir, that gang is becoming bigger
by the day.
What do you mean bigger?
Till yesterday, there were 15 girls
in the Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang.
What did you say?
"Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang?"
That's what they are called.
But why are you calling them that?
So what am I supposed to call them?
Okay, sorry.
-Fifteen girls?
-And today one more.
Sixteen.
Bitches! You should send our boys.
I sent them sir.
They got beaten up and ran away.
I wasn't beating them up
because they're women,
but they are taking us men for a ride.
They've become very smart.
They use something
on their phones... Tracking...
Prey!
The app you used to use
to keep a check on your wife... The same.
This is Laxmi's handiwork...
Bloody bitch...
-What are the police doing?
-What will the police do sir?
You tell me, what can they do?
They are getting their money, cut on time
and it's the same amount.
This means she has struck a deal
with the police...
and now she's making a fool out of us.
Great...
Well done!
Teach them a lesson!
Bu Bu...
Bu Bu...
Run! Police...
Get in quickly, come on...
Come on!
Where do you think you're going?
-Leave me!
-Shut up!
-Laxmi...
-Come on...
Get in, get in!
Bring her!
Throw her on the floor.
Please let her go!
Let her go!
Now it's your turn...
No! Please let her go!
Revolutionaries!
Now I'll show you what it's really
like on screen.
Turn her around.
Turn her around.
Bloody bastard, you asshole!
-Dog!
-Go ahead!
Take this!
Get up!
Go ahead!
Tikli..
Tikli...
-Let me go. Leave me...
-Stop her... stop her now!
You stop.
Sir!
This is not right sir.
We might be from the street,
but this isn't the way to treat us sir.
-Leave her!
-Sir!
Look sir...
Please come inside and see.
Tear this bitch's clothes off...
More! Come here now!
Sir... he's really hurt the girl.
She's unconscious.
My room.
I said now!
Take her to the hospital soon.
Thank you sir. Thank you.
Keep your hands away.
Don't you dare touch her.
-Pick her up.
-Pick her up.
Pick her up.
Slowly.
Come.
Slowly, slowly.
Be slow!
Who are you?
Her family.
Okay. Look, she has a fractured rib.
Her wind pipe is damaged.
Due to excess pressure on the chest
and the throat, she's hurt badly.
We'll have to keep her
on oxygen support...
and under observation for a few days.
Also, try not to indulge in any fights
for the next few days.
Laxmi Didi...
Laxmi!
Shaari... take her home.
She won't be of any help.
Take her home in a cab.
Fuck you Mumbai.
Go fuck yourself in the ass.
But you're also like us.
A woman.
Who has been taken advantage of
by everybody.
Goddess Mumba Devi
Please forgive me
For I have stood by and thus been part
Of every terrible punishment you've borne
Even the short time hotel owners
have refused to let us in...
We're ready to pay extra,
but we can't stop working, right?
They asked us
to leave these streets forever.
They asked us to leave Mumbai, for good.
They said if they see us again,
they will kill us.
We'll leave these streets.
We won't be seen ever again.
But Mumbai doesn't belong to anyone!
This is our work.
And this is what we will do.
In the same place,
within the same streets.
We'll work
and we won't even pay a single rupee.
-What? What do you mean?
-How?
-Just wait a sec.
-What is she saying?
Listen girls.
Behind the main roads,
at the gates of broken buildings,
there's one thing...
that can be part of our new system.
-What is it?
-What is it?
Watchmen.
If the hotel guys refuse to let us in,
this is our new hotel.
This is our second hotel.
No manager, no drama, no bribe!
And police?
I'm getting a switch made
for one of the road lights.
An electrician is helping us out.
This light can be seen
from each corner of the park.
And if a watchman demands for extra bribe?
The money is ours... and so is Mumbai,
he is also our own!
Mumbai, "she" also is our own!
Laxmi Didi...
today three new girls joined the group.
-Shall I show you their pictures?
-My dear selfie pro...
Have you clicked their picture?
Don't you think
you should reveal your sexiest habits
just a slightly bit slower to new people?
Okay listen.
Now there's one thing
that could turn our small gang
into a big company.
See...
Every girl will add 500 rupees
-in this bag every day.
-But?
-See, what do we want?
-What?
Safety, right?
So we need to cut that fool Mhatre
and the likes of him out.
We will approach
Corporator Shinde directly.
Now it'll be just us
and the Corporator.
Hotel guys out, police out, Mhatre out.
Laxmi Bomb,
-isn't that a bit too much?
-Listen to me.
Now we have to think like the big bosses
of a big company.
For how long can we fool Mhatre
and the police officers?
Think about it.
They will realize it someday
and when they do,
we will be in big trouble.
No...
we have to cut them out.
One hundred percent.
If we pay money to someone else,
isn't that
exactly the same situation as before?
No.
Everyone has to pay up money
to somebody or the other.
Like, toothpaste manufacturers...
They have to pay money
to those who make tubes,
pay to the advertisers and so on.
But the remote control is with them.
Did we have the remote control
with us until now? No.
Laxmi Bomb, whatever you say,
we will all do exactly that.
Anything for you.
-Sure?
-Sure.
-Will everyone put money in this bag?
-Yes.
-Yes.
-Very good.
What's up Laxmi Bomb?
So now whose revolution is this?
Tikli...
How are you?
Yeah.
This is our revolution!
Whatever Laxmi says, we do!
-Correct!
-Correct!
She speaks correct.
Come on...
This is our revolution!
There's no point
in coming to work these days.
What?
Business is slow.
Seems like all our customers
have run away.
But the other problem
has been solved, right?
Tikli and Laxmi
must have run away from the city...
They'd forgotten their place
in the order of things,
and they were reminded.
Now they've understood.
Hey Mangatram...
-Why are you laughing?
-Nothing sister, nothing.
Want a tight slap?
I'm laughing for no particular reason.
Are you going to tell me,
or should I take my knife out?
Today I saw Heera Moti...
She had on brand new
Ray Ban sunglasses... a new mobile.
Can you imagine how much they're making?
You're talking nonsense.
Okay, supposing, just supposing,
just for a minute.
They are all working,
but none of them are paying any bribe.
Neither to Mhatre, nor to the police.
Just imagine.
All they have to do is not work here,
but elsewhere.
So just do the math,
how much money would they be saving,
and how much would they be earning?
I'm just asking you to imagine...
You're getting upset for nothing.
You're talking nonsense. Idiot.
Oh leave it.
-You get upset over such little things.
-Get lost, you dog.
Leave it.
AURA THE HUB
Money is power.
Now we have power.
This has always been men's ploy.
At home, or outside.
One month.
Twenty girls.
Three hundred thousand rupees.
Hurray to Tikli and Laxmi Bomb!
Hurray to all of us!
Now?
Now?
Corporator Shinde.
What is this?
Installment.
Yes, Kripalani. Tell me.
Yes.
Yes.
Two girls from Malad
are not doing too well.
We need to replace them.
The girl from Nepal,
yes ask her to get to work.
Yes.
Listen, the one from Borivali is pregnant.
Get it aborted.
Was it yours?
No.
So get it cleaned up,
and ask her to get to work.
Auditions are on.
Yes.
-Okay, fine.
-Sir...
Sir, sir we have a propo...
That's it, done.
Anarkali, you're selected.
Come by at night.
And from tomorrow onward,
you work at the bar.
Okay? And Bipasha...
don't you know how to shimmy?
Get out now.
Let them go.
Sir, we wanted to present you
with a proposal sir.
You're Laxmi right?
Yes, sir.
Sir, we girls wanted
to give you a proposal.
We girls want to run our own section.
We want to run it ourselves.
-We...
-Try me in that mouth?
You all are getting me wrong.
I meant this.
No sir...
Although mine is more dangerous than this.
Three months, 600,000 rupees.
If you can manage, then we have a deal.
Or you may leave.
Okay sir.
Done.
Now we'll come back
only when we have 600,000 rupees.
But we won't give Mhatre
or the police a single rupee after this.
Mhatre will cry.
Just like a little girl.
Not a single rupee to him.
Sir, Mhatre gives you three,
we have committed to the double of that.
We know the numbers.
We are the ones earning.
You girls have a lot of gusto...
Agreed.
Thank you, sir.
Wait... wait. Something sweet?
You have some.
Take it.
Where are you going?
Run, go get yourself fucked in a hurry.
Don't forget... Six hundred thousand.
You know he wants to become an MLA.
Move.
He will need money every month.
Get off and walk properly. Listen to me.
You nut, listen to me.
He will need money every month.
So we'll have to do something...
So all the customers only deal with us.
Are you listening?
Manda and Mhatre should be left
without any business.
Understood?
Stop wasting time and think.
Come on.
How come you thought of me
after so many days?
I felt like it.
Here take this.
What's this?
-Loyalty program.
-What?
If you buy this, you will save a lot.
Save what?
How much do you pay for one session?
Eight hundred rupees right?
If you buy this,
you need to pay only 600 rupees.
Seriously?
-Not bad.
-It's absolutely brilliant.
So, how much for the entire box?
Three thousand six hundred rupees.
And you can use this box
with the rest of the 20 girls too.
I guess I'll have
to use this scheme soon then.
No discount?
Come on, enough drama.
Come.
You nut!
What made you think of this idea?
What's this?
Terrific job Ustad!
Sir, hail the Taj.
Keep this. Psycho.
DHIRAJ REG CUSTOMER
MONTY REG CUSTOMER
Customers are finishing
an entire packet at a time.
Now we have four...
and we need to make another
200,000 in a week.
Laxmi...
-I'm a little worried.
-Why?
-Many new girls have joined us.
-Yeah, so?
What if Mhatre finds out?
What if he gets suspicious
and goes snooping around?
He will find out eventually.
We'll have to do something about it.
Woah!
Great... Isn't it?
Awesome!
Just now there.
Beaten the watchman.
What?
It was only then that he told me
about this bonk-a-bonk in the garden.
Superb!
If you go against Mhatre...
your game is over.
Come on!
The end.
-Shaari...
-Mhatre...
-Shaari...
-why did you hit watchman uncle?
Shaari... Shaari...
Shaari...
Mhatre!
Shaari!
Shaari!
Shaari!
Mhatre!
Shaari!
What did you do Mhatre...
Shaari!
Take a good look at the kind
of death she's dying.
Do you want to die like her?
Do you?
Then pack up and leave,
go back to your villages.
Now.
Sir... Sir!
Don't you dare, Manda.
Anyone who messes with Mhatre
will die like this.
Bitch.
Sir, please let us take her
to the hospital.
-She will die, please.
-Let her die.
Her body belonged to Mhatre
while she was alive.
And her body belongs to Mhatre
when she's dead.
Mhatre will decide what he wants
to do with it. But all of you...
Final notice.
Today, you leave Mumbai, permanently.
Laxmi leader,
you better make your gang understand.
If I see any of them,
they will die exactly like this.
Go, leave with your gang now.
Leave.
Leave...
Sigh
Make her lie down here.
Let her sleep here.
You'll never be able to buy gold.
You'll live like a dog
and die like one.
Diamonds!
Stand properly.
Don't you understand?
Sir, we've got the money.
Money.
Shall I keep it here?
Money...
Six hundred thousand rupees,
as promised.
You kept your word.
Now I will keep mine.
Enjoy your freedom.
That street is now yours.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome Laxmi.
Sir!
Don't touch them.
They are my girls now.
Sir...
Sir... I have just one phone.
Sir.
Tell me.
These bitches have destroyed my life.
I have been working for you
for the past 20 years.
She's giving me double the money,
son of a bitch.
Double. Have you been able
to give this much till date? Double.
They don't even
give the police their share.
Bloody dog...
That's because I am paying
the police myself.
They take less money from me.
You should have done the same years ago.
So why didn't you?
You wanted to be a hero, right?
Son of a bitch!
It is me who should be upset with you.
And that doubles too.
Keep the phone now.
Bastard.
Bloody!
Come on, start the auto-rickshaw.
Start the rickshaw.
I didn't miss the shot.
-The relationship came in my way...
-What are you murmuring?
Nothing, sir.
Enjoy!
Hey Manda, you will trip and fall!
Crazy woman...
Mad!
Can't believe it right?
Neither can I.
Come on Lokkhi Bomb...
Today, let yourself go! Let's party.
Lokkhi Bomb...
If Shaari were here,
she would have celebrated this day
with all her might...
Don't stop.
Pass it along.
Long live Laxmi.
Laxmi Bomb...
Come on... let the music begin..
What?
You have to sing any one
of your songs now...
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...
What nonsense!
Please sing...
You sing so well...
Sing one for this little sister
of yours, please..
Okay... enough drama...
I'm singing!
Okay...
One... two... three... Action.
Mumba Devi
Please forgive me
I've punished you gravely...
Dont like to do with anyone.
Mumba Devi
Please forgive me
I've punished you gravely...
Dont like to do with anyone.
Enough... Done.
That was Laxmi Malwankar
Say hi...
What is this?
And I am Tikli AKA Putul.
And this is our gang.
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...
We have started a revolution against men
on the streets of Mumbai.
And we built our own system
of sex workers.
And we have won!
Even you can do it.
But you have to try...
If you don't try, nothing will change.
Am I right Laxmi bomb?
Who are you talking to?
To whom you are saying this?
I am talking to all the women
in the world.
Laxmi Bomb,
you are very strong.
But what's the one thing in the world
you are most scared of?
Most scared.
Shall I tell you? Lizards!
What rubbish! You're talking nonsense.
I'm asking you seriously.
That my songs...
will die in my notebook.
Nobody will listen to them.
You?
That...
I will not only die like a dog,
but also live like one.
What do you mean?
I mean I want to live like a king.
You mean like a queen.
No, like a king!
So...
What's the road ahead?
There's a new MLA in town.
Her name is Kiran Singh.
I've heard she cares a lot
for women's issues.
We should go meet her.
To evict people like Shinde,
we need to legalize our work.
But how to contact her?
-That's simple.
-What?
-Give me your phone.
-I don't have her number.
-Not her number.
-So then how will we contact her...
I'll tell you...
The other day, I'd downloaded
Facebook on your phone...
I didn't see it.
See...
Now... go to Facebook
and search for Kiran Singh.
Is she the one?
Yes she's the one.
Anything you want to tell her,
just write it on Facebook.
Facebook.
I am saving this on your phone.
I don't understand this Facebook!
Now you're a bit high.
Later when you see it,
you'll understand it.
Are you mad?
-I don't want to get into this mess.
-Come on now.
-Let's leave.
-I'll tell you later.
Okay understood. Come on.
-Let's leave. Wake her up.
-Tikli and Laxmi Bomb Gang.
-Come on!
-Let's go.
Tsamchoe, get up,
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...
Take Shaari's phone.
Get up! Let's move!
-Get up.
-Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang..
Come on, get up.
Tikli and Laxmi Bomb gang...
What have you bought?
Hey Tikli, show me.
What is this?
Are you insane?
You know we've just begun
our business right? We need the money.
Even you've bought yourself a guitar,
right sister?
My guitar costs 5000...
and your chain costs hundreds
of thousands. How is there any comparison?
I should have never shown this to you.
I knew this is how you would react.
I sold my gold to pay Shinde off.
So now if I buy some gold from
my own money, why is that a problem?
Even I sold the harmonium
which was a family heirloom.
That's not the point.
Look Laxmi..
-This is important to me.
-Why?
Buying this gold...
you won't understand. It is important.
Shinde.
Yes, sir.
What?
Sir...
how will we?
Please.
Okay, sir,
we will do it.
What happened?
Seven hundred thousand rupees!
Shinde wants 700,000 rupees.
Why?
He says earlier he used to get money
from both Mhatre and us.
Now all the girls are with us,
so Mhatre isn't able to pay him anything.
We'll talk to him about finalizing this
at 700,000...
but we'll have to pay up now.
How much did this necklace cost?
How much?
One hundred fifty thousand rupees.
Tikli! Are you completely
out of your mind?
Yes, I took a small loan.
-Loan?
-It's from our money, I'll return it.
This is not our money.
Tikli... are you mad?
This money belongs to the girls.
We can't use it for ourselves.
Now we have to give Shinde 700,000
and we have only five.
The month ends in five days.
How will we manage to make the money?
Why are you getting so angry?
We have five days.
-We'll figure something out.
-What will you figure out?
I'll talk to Shinde.
-I'll explain the situation to him.
-Tikli, you've fucked us all over, openly.
Laxmi... Laxmi...
-Laxmi listen to me..
-Leave me!
-Let me make you understand.
-Leave me!
What will you make me understand?
-What do you want to say?
-Two minutes, let me talk.
Laxmi...
please listen to me once.
I told you right...
this is important for me.
Shinde sir?
At least read the texts I've sent you.
I've sent you so many.
Laxmi, listen...
My favorite girls.
-Sir...
-Sir...
One of the girls
has gotten into an accident.
They've taken her to the hospital.
So?
So this month the money is less.
Less than seven?
Less than six.
But next month
the girls will make it up...
Do you think I'm running a charity
for your father here?
Mhatre has never given me a single rupee
less in 20 years. Do you know that?
Sir... I said there's been a problem.
-Why are you dragging my father into this?
-Bloody bitch..
Your father must have been a motherfucker
to give birth to a whore like you!
Hold her down!
What's the matter Laxmi?
Didn't the police explain this to you?
Do one thing...
let me fuck you in the ass
a couple of times.
And then you can pay me
the rest of the money next month.
Laxmi... Laxmi... come on...
-No!
-You are doing wrong
-Tikli... No!
-Shut your mouth.
-Please tell her something!
-Shut your mouth.
Ask him to shut his mouth.
Shut up, you shut up. Relax.
Leave me. Leave me.
-Relax.
-Leave him.
-Leave him.
-Tikli... No!
Make her understand..
Laxmi, say something to her..
-She's my sister.
-Tikli
My sister...
If you touch her,
I'll stab you in the ass...
You won't be able
to sit on your ass all your life.
Laxmi run!
Leave him!
Leave!
Brother.
Run...
Kill them! Call Munna!
Kill them!
Come on...
Laxmi...
-Please Listen...
-Give me your phone.
I'll call Tsamchoe.
Pick up!
She's not answering.
Why is no one answering their phones?
Let's go to Tsamchoe's house..
Tsamchoe!
-Tsamchoe!
-Laxmi, run!
Let's go!
Run!
Sister...
Sister...
No one's picking up their phones...
Everyone is...
We had one chance to change everything.
One chance!
And you...
Shinde was controlling
all the chances we ever got.
We need to stay in the game to change it.
How will you understand this?
Your Rampuri knife
thinks more than you do...
We had made a family.
Do you even know what a family means?
My entire family
was wiped out in front of my eyes.
I know what family means.
Please forgive me.
Just leave... Leave.
Sister..
-Sister, sorry.
-Go to hell!
Video...
Kiran Singh...
-Wait... you bitch...
-Wait!
She's dead, that bitch... Come on...
Laxmi Didi please forgive me.
This gold is very important for me.
You think I'm just 10 days old
in this business.
But I've been in this
for over two lifetimes.
My mother was a sex worker
and I was born into this world.
My mother's pimp set her on fire one day.
Somehow I escaped from there...
and he screamed from behind...
"You will live like a dog
and die like a dog."
And then finally, look where I ended up...
in Mumbai's brothel.
My mother had only one dream...
she wanted to wear a gold necklace.
Even that wasn't fulfilled.
That's when I decided
that I may die like a dog
but I will never live like one.
If I have to live,
I will live like a king.
And one last thing, sister...
Monu does not exist.
I just made him up...
To be able to feel
like I have some family.
Everyone in my family is dead.
Monu is just an alarm.
An alarm...
I have only one family member
and that's you.
Really.
Please forgive me sister.
That was Laxmi Malwankar.
-Say hi.
-Hi.
What is this?
And I am Tikli... AKA Putul...
Now go to Facebook
and search for Kiran Singh.
Go tell Shinde.
Yes sir.
It's done.
One second. Yes, the job is done .
I'll come. Yes I'll be there.
Hi, Raees. How are you?
Let's meet at the roadside restaurant.
Will you come? Absolutely.
Yes we'll both be there. Okay hang up now.
She will be working with you from now on.
Teach her everything, properly.
Shweta,
Bengali bombshell.
Okay, all the best.
Come... get your rickshaw started.
Come on, get ready.
The cops might come today...
They will take us to the station.
It's that time of the month
when they raid the street.
Don't we bribe them regularly?
Mhatre sir told me about it...
So why would they take us
to the police station?
What are you, stupid?
We bribe them
and they'll still do whatever they fancy.
That's the way it's always been,
over the ages.
Just because it's always been,
doesn't mean that
that's the way it will always be.
What do you say, sister?
Did you see Tikli and Lokkhi Bomb's video?
It's gone viral on the internet.
And that MP Kiran Singh...
She has created a huge furor... really!
