"Sandrews makes good films..."
Lena Nyman.
Drama Student. Age 22.
-Please!
-No.
Vilgot Sjöman.
Director. Age 42.
-But I really want to.
-No.
I am curious
I'm not!
You and yourfilms!
-I thought itwas my mum.
-Your mum!
Buy our film, the only film in
two versions: one yellow, one blue!
Buy the yellow, buy the blue,
buy them both, there's two.
The same, but different, that's true.
-True, not mellow.
-Blue and yellow.
-This is the yellow version!
-Buy the yellow version!
a yellow film
Yevtushenko.
Russian poet. Age 33.
Louder!
Right on, radical students!
Farther left!
Left! Left! Left!
Farther left!
"ln Rio de Janeiro,
you can screw for free..."
Do you see that guy?
His name's Magnus. He's an actor.
He'd be great as the slave.
I could have a love scene with him.
-What kind of love scene?
-Just a quickie, you know.
Well...
Dear friends!
I've heard this is a revolutionary
student organization.
But if you organize the revolution
like this meeting, can it succeed?!
It's a damned shame
she doesn't understand politics.
But God, drama students...!
Over Babi Yar-
-there are no memorials.
The steep hillside...
I must tell Lena about
the fate of Swedish socialism.
No, about the two heads
of Swedish socialism.
The big, self-satisfied one
and the little, shrunken one.
I like my own sweet name
I like the touch of fame
LENA ON THE ROAD
I "smuggled" Lena into my bed.
She doesn't dare tell her mum.
Her mum thinks she's spending
the night with a girlfriend.
It's bad to fall for your star.
You get blind to her affectations.
Bergman used to say that.
It never happened to him, though.
I met Lena when we shot "491 ",
but nothing much happened then.
We felt a little attraction.
Small fireworks, that's all.
Those were the days!
-ls there a class system in Sweden?
-A class system?
I don't think so.
We have... I mean,
everybody sort of sticks together.
I don't know...
-I don't think so.
-You don't?
No politics, thanks.
-Does Sweden have a class system?
-Yes!
An architect or a doctor earns 1 0-1 5
times a restaurant worker's wage.
-Do you think that's fair?
-Yes, it's fair.
It takes at least 7 more years of
studies and a lot of self-sacrifice.
But 1 0-1 5 times more - that's
an awful lot. Isn't it too much?
Well... I wouldn't say
it's far too much.
It's fair because those who don't
have the intellectual ability-
-could never manage
a gruelling higher education.
-I have to go now.
-Thank you.
-Do women have equal opportunities?
-Yes, I suppose so.
Sure, if not more so. Aren't
women the ones who rule now?
-ls this hospital a hierarchy?
-No...
So there's no difference between
a doctor and a nurse's assistant?
Well, of course, when you eat...
Yes, when you eat.
-ls there a class system in Sweden?
-No.
-Specifically...?
-I missed the question!
-Does Sweden have a class system?
-I'm not Swedish. But I understand.
I only speak German...
I...not...Swedish.
-Do we have a class system?
-Yes, we do.
In a way.
-No, I don't think so.
-Have the class barriers gone?
We have a bit further to go...
We can't go much further. Wages
have to differ for productivity.
No interviews!
It was the white-collar workers
in the 30's. The gap's wider today.
It depends on the people.
Undress them and they're all alike.
Dress them,
and you have a class system.
To learn more about this, I visited
the Labour Movement Headquarters.
There can't be a class system.
We live in a democratic society.
-Are you from the Labour Movement?
-No.
-None of you?
-No.
-No.
-No.
Why is the Labour Movement so
conservative on women's equality?
Have you found it to be so?
If that's true, it could be because
a lot of Swedes are conservative.
So there must be plenty
in the Labour Movement, too.
Why don't women have
equal job opportunities?
-That's what you allege.
-Are you saying it isn't true?
-I'm just saying: give me proof.
-Present facts, not just words.
My mother is a fur seamstress.
She works every day of the year.
-She earns about 1 4,000 crowns.
-What would I make as a seamstress?
-You'll never be one.
-Who knows?
-Does Sweden have a class system?
-Yes, to a certain extent.
-What're you doing about it?
-I'm going to climb!
-Because I'm part of this society.
-You work in the Labour Movement?
No.
I'm an architect.
-Yes, there is a class system.
-What're you doing about it?
-Nothing at the moment, anyway.
-Why not?
Our society has class barriers,
and we follow democratic laws-
-over which the individual
doesn't have much influence.
-The individual can't do much.
-Can't he or she do anything?
I don't think so.
I'm not an active Union member.
-We're going to negotiate.
-What happens then?
You don't know how
these things work?
No.
That's why I'm asking you.
-Read the newspapers!
-What happens at such negotiations?
Do they give results? How long will
it take to remove class barriers?
A very long time, probably.
People are very conservative.
-They don't want radical change.
-Such as what?
Extended governmental activities,
for one thing.
And more extensive control
over businesses is another.
-Anything else?
-What else are we going to do?
So you think you're doing something
to get rid of the class system?
-As much as I can.
-Why can't you do more?
It has to do with
what your social position is.
So you have to be at the very top?
No! It must be pressure from below
that is felt all the way to the top.
Do the really powerful, influential
big shots do what they can, then?
Olof Palme.
Minister of Transport. Age 39.
I think we still have
strong elements of a class system.
Someone called it a class system
based on income-
-and it's easy to see why.
Rural workers earn less than city
workers, women earn less than men.
Older people earn less than young.
Our educational system
perpetuates the class system.
Those who graduate
from university-
-earn 6-7 times more than those-
-who leave school to work
out in the countryside.
Come out instead! That banging
is recorded on the sound track!
I have found this problem of a class
system in Sweden to be a tough one.
-What is your own background?
-I come from a middle-class family.
You read, you see what's happening,
and suddently a pattern emerges.
This happened to me
between the ages of 1 5 and 20-
-when I observed
American society.
-You travelled in the States? When?
-ln '47-'48. I hitch-hiked.
Through 34 states.
Three months with no money.
The influences on me are a mixture:
fiction has its political importance-
-and political economics and visual
impressions. It's a good mixture.
-How much more time do you need?
-Another fifteen minutes.
Mårten ("Mouse"). Age 5.
Mouse! That's right.
Mouse wanted to be here.
He forgot his question. He didn't
want Olof to become a Minister.
Neither did l!
Foreigners tend to think that
we're far ahead of everyone else.
-Are we?
-Compared to other countries, yes.
And compared to Sweden's situation
30-40 years ago, too.
Butwe haven't come far-
-in making our dream of
an egalitarian society come true.
Most of the work is yet to be done.
But isn't it sad that
after 30 years in power-
-our Social Democratic government
has achieved so little there?
-Not right now!
-Are you pissed off?
Y es, you are pissed off!
1 97 4...that's in 6-7 years.
-So you intend to live that long.
-Stop horsing around, will you!
You are sulking!
Hell, yes! Afterthe way you
and Magnus behaved at the Palme's!
To make this film I need some peace,
and there you sitwhile I'm trying...
I can't listen to Palme.
I don't knowwhat he's talking about.
You could at least pretend to
understand what it's all about.
Is thatwhy I don't get a love scene
with Magnus? You're crazy!
You want a girl in your film
and a girl in your bed, don't you?
And if you can combine the two,
all the better, right?
So what? Don't you want the leading
role and someone in bed, too?
-So who is using whom?
-Okay, but not on the same terms.
Martin Luther King.
Age 37.
-I like him.
-Yes, of course you do.
He talks about more interesting
things than Palme, in my opinion.
Non-violence?
Isn't thatwhat Mods do?
-Have you heard of non-violence?
-No, I haven't.
Thank you!
Aren't they those educated people
who don'twant to hurt others?
Martin Luther King, for instance.
-Do you know of his methods?
-He won't fight for his beliefs.
-Can you see better or worse?
-Worse, I think.
Could you consider being
a conscientious objector?
No.
No.
Yes.
I want to get out
as quickly as possible.
I think it'll go faster
if you don't resist.
You have to serve longer
if you won't bear arms.
The army pays me for ten months,
I get to live here in Stockholm-
-with free room and board.
-What's more, learn how to kill.
We are part of a system of violence.
YOU ARE FREE
FROM MlLlTARY DUTY
-So we should maintain our defence?
-Absolutely not.
-Why not refuse completely?
-One should refuse military service.
But one shouldn't refuse to work
for peace in some civil institution.
We encourage all citizens
to refuse military service.
If Sweden were occupied,
howwould we defend ourselves?
I wasn't taught such things,
because I wasn't trained for combat.
Ask people who were.
I don't think so.
It depends on their military rank.
What would you others do
if we were invaded?
Not give up.
Sweden doesn't give up.
And ignore all the radio messages
that say Sweden's defeated.
-ls that what you learn?
-It's in the book "ln Case of War".
REFUSE TO KlLL!
REFUSE MlLlTARY SERVlCE!
NON-VlOLENCE
lS YOUR DEFENCE!
If you can teach everyone in the
country, they have a better chance!
IF WE ARE OCCUPlED
If they learn that many of them
will be tortured, many will die.
But the advantage is that
less people will die this way-
-than in a war where people throw
bombs. So you reduce the losses.
That sure as hell has to be
worth something! Where were we...?
SOClAL DEMOCRACY:
lTS GUlLTY CONSClENCE
We have negotiation, demonstrations,
strikes, sit-ins, hunger strikes...
NON-COOPERATlON
Civil disobedience,
fraternization...
-Paralyze the entire society...
-ls parallel government on the list?
-Who do we send this to?
-The Commander in Chief.
-I tried the shower yesterday.
-Yeah? How did it work?
It didn't.
I held it the way you told me to.
Why not try a vacuum cleaner?
I know a girl who does.
No, I prefer using a vibrator.
THE NYMAN lNSTlTUTE
What have you got there?
Stolen goods?!
Don't worry, he's asleep.
Dad! Civil war in Spain!
Riots in Ådalen, workers shot!
A general strike!
What did I tell you?
-You did a great job, Magnus.
-But Lena...
-What's the Nyman lnstitute?
-I've started up my own business.
Newspapers work too fast,
and science works far too slow.
-You start on the stencils...
-What's this bag?
Announcing a fantastic contest!
Guess what Lena has in this bag!
1st prize: a beach lot in Spain,
2nd prize: a luxury cruise.
3rd prize:
a workout with Princess Birgitta!
Are people so greedy they won't
work more if they're taxed more?
Don't you think their jobs
mean anything?
Are you that damned stupid?
Do you know what I think?
You're a Conservative.
Read Svenska Dagbladet!
The paper with the oldest views.
The newspaper with gout!
Svenska Dagbladet!
THE CONSERVATlVE STUDENTS
Some people are born with limited
talents and brains. They are lost.
Others have quite another prospect,
born with brains and talent.
Should they be rewarded for that?
And get better jobs and income?
They work with what they enjoy
and have a better life.
Shouldn't one do something
to change this? Well?
Are there any interesting cases
here? People in sleazy flats?
My paper is planning a conservative
victory in the '68 elections.
We're doing a series on the ten
most sordid social welfare cases...
I suppose we'll always have to
put up with the class system.
-Shouldn't something be done?
-No, hardly.
-Why not?
-Well it turns up everywhere anyway.
Take Russia. You can own a house
there now, and have a profession.
-Why shouldn't we at least try?
-lt hasn't worked so far.
I didn't like his answers
and went to the Russian Embassy.
HAVE YOU ESTABLlSHED
A NEW CLASS SYSTEM?
Then we went to the
travel agencies.
REMEMBER THE ClVlL WAR?
FRANCO WON
DO YOU LlKE FRANCO?
SALAZAR lS HlS PAL
I went to the airport. Some Swedish
tourists were just home from Spain.
Were you ashamed of going
to a dictatorial state?
Not at all.
-Why should I be?
-Because of Franco and his regime.
We have dictatorship here, too, when
a bottle of whisky costs 50 crowns.
That's a form of dictatorship, too!
-We just couldn't decide...
-But Spain was cheaper than lsrael.
-How's the average Spaniard doing?
-Just fine.
They aren't going hungry.
They're very poor...
-Do you like Franco?
-No comment.
-Don't you have any opinions?
-No, I don't think so.
I prefer not to talk about him.
Ask someone who lives there.
Ask a Spaniard what he thinks
of Franco, he'll say: "He's okay".
-He'd better!
-Hush, will you!
-Have you everthought of Franco?
-I've neverthought of you.
Do you know Franco? No?
Neither do l.
-What do you think of his regime?
-I don't talk politics on holiday.
I just go there to relax.
-I go for the sun and the sea...
-I don't care about that...
-You forget about it down there.
-You don't give a damn?
I wouldn't say that.
One can't be bothered.
You don't care if a whole country
is oppressed under a dictator?
Yes, but I don't want
to get involved.

Hi!
Hi!
-Did you hearwhat I said?
-Why do you want all that money?
I'm going to see a hypnotist.
You oughtto pay back
what you borrowed!
Don't I give you pocket money
now and then?
But this was a loan.
And I've got to have it today!
You've promised me at least
ten times that I'd get it back.
-You borrowed it three months ago.
-OK, all right!
Well, give it back then.
-I have an errand for you.
-I need a hundred in advance.
Impossible.
-What's the errand?
-To go to the restorer.
I must run.
Foreman Evert Evensson, you're
involved in defending this plant.
My task is to sabotage
this machinery.
These machines produce
pump capsules.
-Are they sensitive instruments?
-Yes, extremely.
-How will you sabotage it?
-I'll show you.
This is a relay, you see.
By damaging just a small detail
in this relay-
-the whole machine
is put out of function.
-It's hard to find the fault?
-Very. And I also delay the repair.
-ls it part of a big sabotage plan?
-Yes. There are many possibilities.
-Wouldn't an enemy kick you out?
-One never knows.
We'll fight the enemy but
make friends with the soldiers.
FRATERNlZATlON
So you believe in non-violence?
I was on a course for it.
It seemed really sensible.
You used to be in the military, do
you believe more in non-violence?
Oh yes. Ifyou can show...
Come on in.
-Lena!
-Go to hell!
-Damn kid!
-What's wrong with her?
Oh, never mind her.
I AM FREE
-This sabotage has consequences?
-Major consequences.
The new planes and buses
won't function.
They become blind themselves.
The ones who've gotten a grip
on this and found out about it.
They think that those who can see
will take care of them.
Then, imagine how many
there are left...
Think of all the blind people
there are in this country.
We just keep sending money
to the underdeveloped countries.
Why don'twe see to
our own house first?
We should do that first-
-before we start talking
about other countries.
And they must be retrained
and given new jobs.
In the office, as metal workers,
in dark rooms - whatever that is.
But a metal worker stands at
a lathe, that must be delicate work.
-What do you do?
-He works in a men's wear shop.
-At Rydéns.
-ls it fun?
Sometimes.
-What's going on?
-We were discussing my job.
-ln men's wear?
-This guy is great, you know.
-Quite possibly.
-Hey, listen!
-Could I see your room?
-Sure, but it's a huge mess.
-Okay?
-Yes.
-Here's the money you wanted.
-Where did you get it?
-It's five short.
-You're so like your mum sometimes.
Why do you have Franco
on the wall?
Win the Contest!
-What are these boxes?
-My files.
-What does "R" stand for?
-Religion.
-There's not much in it.
-It's new.
-"M", then?
-Men!
-Do you collect men?
-I used to.
-Did he leave?
-He went back to work.
Maybe I should go, too?
Think so?
No.
Thank you.
Can't you do it?
Thank you.
-ltwon'twork.
-ltwon't?
-No, it won'twork.
-Of course itwill!
Help me!
God, you're slow!

-Just one.

I can't do it!
The bad reception on your screen
has been due to erection failure.
He was a damned ardent socialist.
Belonged to a lot of groups.
And he sang very well,
and read poems.
Then he ran off to fight
in the Spanish civil war.
-The lnternational Brigade.
-How long was he there?
Three weeks.
Was he wounded?
Why did he come back so soon?
I don't know. I've asked him,
but he won't tell me.
-Nasty to put Franco on your wall.
-Yes.
Oh, God! Why pictures
from concentration camps?
-Doesn't that go with Franco?
-1 1 273...?
1 1 273 days since he fled the war.
Do you have a driving licence?
-Yes.
-Did you take First Communion?
-Could you consider being a C.O.?
-Yes.
Should women earn as much as men?
-No.
-Are you married or single?
-Single.
-Should the monarchy be abolished?
-No.
-How did you lastvote?
-Conservative. Previously, Liberal.
-Does Sweden have a class system?
-No, absolutely not.
-Where did you meet my dad?
-At the frame shop.
"Stig Björkman, born '41, confirmed."
He has a driving licence!
-Did you lend Dad money?
-Yes.
-I knew it!
-Cheers, Lena!
-When did I first attract you?
-At the frame shop.
-Was I good?
-As an interviewer?
-You were great! Fantastic!
-How many have you slept with?
-I've never counted. Have you?
-Twenty-three.
-But the first nineteen were no fun.
-I see. And I'm twenty-fourth.

Tuesday, June 14th.
Sunrise at 2:35 a.m.
The temperature in Stockholm:
16. 7 °C.
Name-day: Håkan.
In Rio de Janeiro...
...you can screw for free...
The Prime Minister now awakens
to take care of Sweden.
The Minister of Trade wakes up-
-and all the old, staid leftists...
-and the whole mixed economy.
And the right wing rubs its eyes
after the nightmare it's had.
From the depth of Swedish hearts
we sing
a simple hymn to our King.
Show faith to him
don't let him down.
Make light the burden
of his crown.
Carl Gustav? Where are you?
-ls there anything I can do for you?
-No, I'm ready. Is it chilly out?
-No, Your Majesty. Swedish summer.
-A bit chilly, then.
If only Carl Gustavwould bring
the tickets. He said he'd get them.
I know this is a great imposition,
but may I just ask how it feels...
We've had kings for a billion years.
How does it feel to be the last one?
Give me a moment to think about it.
I'll think of an answer.
Yes, it's like this.
What's important is not to confuse-
-the individual with his task.
That is a lesson we all must learn.
I've endeavoured all my life
to be objective about myself.
I have really made an effort.
But sometimes it's very difficult.
But it isn't you personally that
the socialists want to get rid of.
-You have an outstanding...
-Yes, yes, I know...
-Grandfather!
-Yes, I'm here.
Where have you been?
I thought you forgot.
Well... I...
Here they are, anyway.
It's been nice meeting you, Lena.
But I need a nap now.
We're starting a sale at Rydén's.
How do you feel, never being
more than Crown Prince?
I don't give a damn. Call me
at Rydén's. It's in the phone book.
I hope it's nice in ltaly now.
Not too hot. In Rome...
I'd love to go there myself now.
But the institute's so busy
with all its investigations.
Mind the step...
off to ltaly with your master, then?
It may pull a little,
but I'm almost finished.
Who's that coming?
Daddy!
-Hello!
-Daddy!
-It's Daddy.
-Yes, it's Daddy!
Sartre suggested that the Tribunal
apply the Nuremburg convictions-
-to the war crimes in Vietnam.
"We represent no government or
party and take orders from no one."
These were Sartre's words
at the opening of the Tribunal.
"Our lack of power guarantees
our independence, " he said.
What's wrong?
There you are.
-No, I want food.
-This is food.
Now, eat like a good girl.
- Would you like a sandwich?
-Yes, please.
-Beer?
Marie!
-What's that?
-Have a look.
You had it framed?
I paint a lot better now.
-Yes, but it's good.
-That was a wonderful afternoon.
-Are you happy?
-Yes.
Occasionally I was negligent.
Then I'd suddenly be reminded of
how Dad fled the civil war and then...
Believing we should make our views
known, we went to the embassies.
A police car was stationed outside
the American Embassy. All summer.
I said I wanted no trouble, I was
just taking an intellectual stand.
Since the cops didn't understand,
the demonstration was brief.
USA - murderers!
USA - murderers!
USA GET OUT OF VlETNAM!
We went to the Chinese Embassy...
Then, the Russian Ambassador
wasn't in.
SOClALlSM WlTHOUT TYRANNY
But Yevtushenko was there.
He said my signs were ridiculous.
-What does he mean?
-It's very simple.
Millions of people live in a misery
you wouldn't accept for 5 minutes.
With a capitalistic solution you get
free enterprise, free speech.
-But it would take 300 years.
-Let it, then!
But it must be realized in 30 years.
30 years to wipe out illiteracy
and industrialize without force?!
Don't forget that force
means something different to them.
They've been oppressed
for centuries.
So if life can be a little better,
another 30 years means nothing.
But what about the purges, all those
who get deported, labour camps...?
He's written poems about
the people's fear under Stalin.
Can you deny that?
No. He says it's sad the Russian
people had to sacrifice so much.
-But one must take risks.
-Can't he see the risks are hideous?
Sure. But letting millions starve,
is that taking a less hideous risk?
There I was, with my fear
of the Russians and the Chinese-
-and I knew she was probably right.
It was more than I could handle.
When my old man died, I was with...
No, not like that!
It's much harder that way.
Make a light line first.
Like this, see.
Then you press hard.
When my old man died...
-I was lying beside him.
He lay there in the bed,
tossing and turning.
I woke up twice during the night,
but I thought he was just restless.
Butwhen I woke in the morning,
his neck had turned blue.
-Do animals feel death like we do?
-They sure as hell do.
I was at a bullfight once.
I almost puked, and had to leave.
Have some wine!
Do you like Börje?
He's kind of cute.
-Yes, he's a fine boy.
-I'm getting pretty stuck on him.
You think I didn't notice
anything that day?
-Never!
-Yes, I did!
The great thing about that guy...
We had a beertogether and talked.
He told me about his child,
and he talked so warmly about her-
-the same way I felt about you
when you were small and mum left.
-That bitch!
-Oh, she was all right.
Wanting me back after 8 years!
In my solitude
I sing to myself-
-listening to the river.
I hear him calling...
-What's her name, the kid's mother?
-Marie, or something...
I'll take my violin-
-and let the river be my bass...
What does he wantwith me, then?!
He's got Marie, a kid...
-You've experimented plenty.
-Yes, but I talk openly about it.
He hasn't said a thing to me
about it. Everyone knows but me!
Dear old river,
surging in the valley-
-we are old, you and l,
and grey-
Girls want young lovers-
-who are light on their feet-
Our day is gone...
Inside out again?
We sit and watch
as the young dance by.
Our day is gone.
We sit and watch
as the young dance by.
We interrupt this evening's film
for a news bulletin.
After an intense debate
in the Swedish Parliament-
-we now have the result of the vote
on Sweden's new Defence Plan.
No party was unanimous
on the issue, all were split.
And these were the results:
There was a strong majority
among the Social Democrats.
The Communists were strongly
in favour of non-violence-
-while the Conservatives
were opposed.
The final results were
1 87 against and 1 96 in favour.
The Non-violence Defence Plan
has thereby been adopted:
All citizens shall take a four-month
course in non-violence techniques-
-and a refresher course
every three years.
For the first time in history,
this applies to men and women.
Up until the last moment, there were
demonstrations against the reform.
Some student groups turned out
to be unexpectedly conservative.
Last winter our TV team
visited some new draftees.
The programme that day was:
"Sociodrama".
A concept borrowed from the civil
rights movement in the USA.
This was one of the draftees' first
tasks: to block a railroad track.
What if your wife
were lying here...?!
Break it up!
Time for self-criticism.
Stand up. I keep quiet. You talk.
The whole exercise is unrealistic.
This situation wouldn't occur.
They wouldn't come here unarmed.
The situation is ideal for us.
If an ammunition train comes, they
don't stop for people on the track.
-lsn't it hard not to fight back?
-lncredibly hard.
Can you teach yourself
to repress aggressive feelings?
-I think so.
-You don't feel cowardly?
You're happy doing this?
Isn't it a positive step forwomen?
Yes, why should only men
defend themselves?
Why should only they be faced with
getting shot?
To an observer this looks like
a scout camp rather than real war.
This is just as real as
conventional military training.
That also reminds you of scout camp
or playing Cowboys and lndians.
The idea is to personally
befriend the enemy?
Yes, sort of like in World War 1,
when soldiers exchanged cigarettes.
Doesn't fraternizing make you
susceptible to their propaganda?
Yes, but we also make it possible
for them to receive ours.
-We should be open, too.
-Who can withstand most pressure?
Those who can withstand
the pressure of a conventional war.
Now we'll change sides!
Those who were the defenders
will now be the aggressors-
-and the aggressors
become the defenders.
It's important for the aggressors
to feel the thrill and desire-
-so they can really experience
the thrill of violence.
Change groups! Go ahead!
Ready! Go!
Oh, you Stockholm bastard!
Go to hell!
Road hog!

-Do you ever go to church?
-Nope.
-Why not?
-Them's not preaching the truth.
Them's prayin' for the poor
but...you knowwhat them's like.
Would you like to have a woman here
to help you out?
-I sure would.
-Would that be good for you?
My brother here used to do
the cooking.
What a caterwauling that were.
We weren't not never
in time for meals.
No, I can't do it.
Who told you to fuss with the focus?
But it's simple.
Use the opposite arm...
You were using the wrong arm.
Choose another position. This one...
Have a look! Look, then!
Then straight up.
Stretch them like this.
Get lost!
-You were hard to find.
-Have you been searching a lot?
Yes, I have.
-What a nice car you have.
-You like it?
I have a new job.
I quit Rydén's.
-What do you do now?
-Sell cars.
What have you been doing here
all this time?
Here's the doorstep,
where they went in and out.
Selma, Alma, Hulda,
Emilia, Amanda, Emil, Oscar...
All the children.
In 1882, 1883, 1884.
Thatwas the stove. And this is
all there was to the little house.
The 4th commandment: Take care of
those who can't care forthemselves.
The 7th? : "lf you're better off than
you deserve, share. If not, steal."
-Who the hell is Gyllensten?
-He's this fantastic guy.
-What's the point?
-The old ones are irrelevant.
So he's rewritten them.
1, 2, 3, etc...
The first one is: "You shall have
no other gods than temporary ones."
The grammar school, with electricity
and a well. Sold for 3,000.
That's damned cheap!
Yes. The people moved to towns.
Girls mainly. Life here is too hard.
-The 6th commandment?
-What is it?
"You shall not spread VD, give birth
to unwanted kids or commit rape."
"Practice birth control, there are
far too many babies being born."
"Otherwise, you may engage freely
in sexual intercourse, masturbation"-
-"everything your animal nature
might suggest to you."
"Everything it might suggest"!
If he sells 2 - 3 cars a month
he makes 1,200. Then you have the...
-Oh, what's that?
-Two brothers sell junk here.
You see, the average guy makes...
If he sells 8 - 1 0 cars...
No, he'll not sell more than 4 - 5.
He makes about 1,800 a month.
Yes, it's a tough business.
Then you have the top guys...
This is a typical dying village.
It's such a pity.
-Do they cheat, too, these guys?
-Just between you and me...
In 1 964 - a top year - a guy
could make, oh say 20,000 crowns.
-20,000?
-Tax free!
-Such a year won't come again.
-Look at those walls!
Just think how a hundred years ago
they slaved to build those walls.
They they all moved away.
It's all abandoned! Everything!
The top salesmen...
In Rio de Janeiro
you can eat for free...
-ls this all right?
-Very good!
-The keys?
-I forgot them.
-But they're on the key ring.
-I took them off and forgot them.
These are nice.
They should be shorter, though.
And have a big hole here.
-Go and get them!
-No!
-Get them!
-No. Ask Marie!
Why didn't you tell me about Marie?
If you had only told me-
-itwouldn't have mattered,
but to keep it secret like a damned...
-Like a what?
-Will you marry her?
I don't know. I don't think so.
I have a child, you know.
We've talked about it,
Marie and l.
It's a responsibility having a child.
I've thought a lot about it, but...
No, I won't marry her.
MESSAGE TO HUMANlTY:
I FEEL FlNE. LENA
The largest tree in Europe.
It's 42 feet in circumference.
2,000 years old.
-What do you think?
-I guess it should work.
Not bad...
-Hell, my thighs are snapping!
-Your legs? They hurt?
-No, it's my thighs.
-Then feel some of my muscles!
These! What do you think?
Here, feel!
-Are they supposed to be like that?
-No.
But girls are taught to squeeze
their legs together.
They're not to sit like boys,
and that's how the muscles get hard.
-They can barely spread their legs.
-Do you have that problem?
Do you?
You said you'd slept with 23.
-The first 1 9 were no fun.
-Why?
I only did it to satisfy them,
so that they would have an orgasm.
I couldn't believe anybody would
like me, the way I look...
With my drooping breasts,
my big stomach, all my fat...
Temptations, hidden shares,
often take us unawares...
"Madeleine's wish
is Börje's command."
"Which is a hair dryer.
A fine, new hair dryer."

TAKE CARE OF THOSE
WHO CAN'T CARE FOR THEMSELVES
GYLLENSTEN'S 4TH COMMANDMENT
THE BEACH LOT lN SPAlN
THE LUXURY CRUlSE
The winner might be YOU!
Come, Lena!
-To Madeleine...
-Come, Lena.
To Madeleine...
-ls Madeleine dark or blonde?
-Dark.
-Social class?
-Upper.
The slim model type?
-Betterthan that.
-Single?
Engaged. But she'll break it off
because of me.
Does she have a better orgasm
than I do?
I don't know.
I haven't sleptwith her.
Why haven't you slept with her?
Why the hell haven't you?
You and your damned curiosity!
You destroy everything
with chatter and questions!
And you never tell me anything!
Not about Madeleine or Marie!
Why not add Madeleine and Marie
to yourfiles, too?
I don'twant that upper-class bitch!
-You want an idiot like this, right!
-No, keep your hands off it!
You damned swine!
-Lend me "The Unfulfilled Woman."
-You need it! You've got one!
-Gotwhat?
-An unfulfilled woman! Let go of me!
That damned hair dryer!
And the roses!
Just look around! You're into things
that are way over your head!
-You damned pedlar!
-Your head's all messed up.
Why don't you diet? Put dieting
posters up on yourwalls instead.
-I don'twant these tits in my MG!
-You damned pedlar!
I didn't sleep much that night.
I itched and dreamed all night.
In one of the dreams, a soccer team
was running through the forest.
I captured both the varsity
and the second string.
But there were only 23 of them.
Listen, Martin!
I'm sorry I wasn't strong enough.
But that's the way it is.
Börje is a big shit and I'm gonna
kill him when I get hold of him!
You said yourself:
If you can't adhere to non-violence,
you shouldn't participate.
You need people who are strong.
I won't ever speak
for your ideas again.
A government proclamation issued
reforms our whole defence system.
The proclamation reads
as follows:
The Swedish government declares
that in case of enemy occupation-
-all means of resistance will be
employed apart from violence.
The instruction all Swedish citizens
have had in non-violent defence-
-will enable us to carry out this
form of defence, fully confident-
-that Sweden is well-equipped
to meet an enemy attack.
SUPPORT
A SWEDlSH A-BOMB
In order to maintain our neutrality
we need some kind of deterrent.
But then all nations get bombs,
there'd be a huge risk of nuclear...
We'll give you a peace button for
support. A Ban-the-Bomb button.
-We both gave a contribution...
-Thank you.
...as a demonstration
against this terrible sign.
-I think it's a very serious...
-That's awful!
Tearthe sign down, boys!
No bombs here, by God!
Expressing opinions like this!
And in front of the palace, no less!
-We're probing public opinion.
-I don't understand such things...
Thank you.
SOClAL DEMOCRACY:
lTS GUlLTY CONSClENCE
That hurts, Lena!
Where does it hurt most? Tell us!
Win a week with Princess Birgitta.
Or that beach lot in Spain.
Everyone is a winner, if they-
-can guess what Lena found out
about the Social Democrats' guilty...
It's worse elsewhere, but most
societies suffer from a tendency-
-to categorize people with regard
to economic and social position-
-and this tendency
is present here, too.
But I think there is a great feeling
of equality here. What do you think?
It's true that a lot
has been achieved.
In income, for example,
but primarily in opportunities.
But we know we can go further.
It's an illusion to believe
that we've attained total equality.
Börje! You sold mr Johansson a car,
and he's very angry now.
You've promised him everything,
damn it!
You can't just promise
people the moon.
This is your last chance, I'm so mad
I could throw you out on the spot.
-Hello!
-Hello!
Could we talk somewhere?
I'm off now. I can give you a lift.
The car's in the garage...
No!
Have you sleptwith Madeleine?
I bet you've gone further. But
I hope not, 'cos I have scabies.
So that's what I've got!
Cut! You forgot "from you."
lsn't that what we decided on?
I like my own sweet name
I like the touch offame
She's using me, that damned girl.
She uses me like everybody does.
This movie is her chance
and she knows it.
And, boy,
does she take advantage of it!
And she takes Börje along with her.
A toast to the Crown Prince!
Cheers and congrats!
He doesn't give a damn about her,
he just wants to compete with me.
Excuse me a second...
- but Lena, the glasses!
-What about them?
-You remove them when you talk.
But she was supposed to...
-She wears them, then removes them.
-Make up your mind!
-You changed your mind!
-Ask Marianne!
-ltwas decided she'd have them on.
-I was right.
-You don't understand...
-Fourth retake with, fifth without!
Make up your mind, for God's sake!
-Another retake?
-That's what we're here for.
-Make up your mind. We're listening.
-That's nice of you!
-So I remove them.
-You start with them on.
When you talk about scabies,
you look into his eyes, right?
-Then you've removed them, right?
-Without glasses, then?
They're not concentrating at all.
We're not getting anywhere.
That's obvious. I'm shocked
at the atmosphere here.
I don't know how
you get any work done.
-Have you spoken to him?
-No.
-Aren't you going to?
-Yes.
If he's going to be like this...
It could hardly be worse.
No...
-But listen...
-Try it now!
-Yes. A little more.
-That's it.
All right?
Listen...he got his gold frame.
Know how much it cost him?
-280 crowns!
-My word!
And what's he gonna do with it?
Point at it and say to his guests...
Wash your feet, too!
Then he can say to his guests:
"That frame cost 280 crowns."
So what? A gold frame is nice,
and it has a value, too.
After all my years in the shop
I think I know the value of art.
The picture should be
more important than the frame...
What the hell?!
Have you come home?
Can't you at least say hello?
Where are my cuttings on East Asia?
They're not in there...
Where the hell have you been?
-No one dares enter your room.
-Oh, is that so?
You should stay home instead of
hitchhiking, who knows where.
You could at least have sent
a card. Your dad's been worried.
-That's something new for him.
-I was ashamed at work-
-'cos I didn't know where you were.
-That's none of their business!
Börje's been looking for you.
-Are you going to leave home?
-Home! You call this a home?
-Haven't I done all I could for you?
-You just have a guilty conscience.
Do you rememberthattime
you came to my school graduation?
The one time you ever came!
God, was I ashamed!
Do you think I could ever
bring anybody home?
To this! You've only ever done
one good thing in yourwhole life.
You wentto Spain.
Why didn't you stay there?!
Why did you come right back?
Like a damned rat!
What on earth is she doing?
Has it itched a long time?
Somebody's standing in the light.
Turn around, please.
In front of the tiles stands Lena,
scratching her...
Freedom's not easy, sweet Lena,
freedom's not easy, my dear
It tickled and itched all over,
that's why you're standing here now-
-at seven o'clock in the morn!
Rub it into the pubic region.
DDT stings and it itches...
-Can I drop you off?
-No.
-Where are you going?
-None of your business. Bye!
This country's like a duck pond.
It just goes quack, quack, quack...
We haven't trained
our political reactions, see.
Every Swede who votes is full of
ideas he doesn't dare express...
-You're cute when you get excited!
-I do get excited...
-Olle Jacobsson to the studio.
-Hello.
-Olle Jacobsson to the studio.
-Do you know each other?
No. My name's Scherer.
-Lena!
-Bengt Ernryd to the sound stage.
-And the front door key?
-Bengt Ernryd to the sound stage.
You can send it to me, then.
Viveca Nordström to Film Labor.
-Was he difficult?
-No, but God, I'm glad it's over!
Buy our film! The only film
that comes in two versions.
Buy the yellow, buy the blue!
Buy them both, there's two!
The same, but different, that's true!
This was the yellow version!
This was the yellow version!
