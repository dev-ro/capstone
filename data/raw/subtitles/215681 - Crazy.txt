This is the great dining room.
It's so quiet. Only a few are here.
- Most come back tonight.
This view! Wow.
Isn't it great?
Benni, just look at this!
The people are really very nice.
And the air is so good.
Great air.
- Bye.
And don't smoke so much!
- He shouldn't smoke at all!
All the best, Benni.
Hang in there.
You'll see: A few more days,
then you'll like it here.
If you have problems, call me.
You know, I'm always there for you.
I already have 4 schools behind me.
This here should be my last
on the glorious path to University.
From 6 in Math I need a 5.
Otherwise I fail once more.
I have until the summer holidays.
That's 4 months. My father says:
Without University you are nothing in this world.
A common graduation
would be really embarrassing.
Hello.
What are you staring at?
I live here now, too.
- Congratulations.
I'm Benni.
And you're...?
Janosch.
I believe we even go to the same class.
- Crazy.
Bonjour.
- Bonjour.
Quiet down, please.
I hope you all had
nice vacations with your families.
Here's the new one.
May I sit down?
I can't say that.
To learn French,
one here speaks French.
Simply say some kind words.
Introduce yourself to the school.
My name is Benjamin.
I'm 16 years old.
And I'm a cripple.
My left arm
and my left leg are paralyzed.
Just so you know.
Perhaps it's interesting.
I don't know any more.
Sit down please beside Janosch.
There is a free space.
Well, then.
Read to me what you did
during the vacation.
Song of Autumn:
The long sobs of the violins,
of Autumn wound my heart
with their monotonous languor.
Very suffocating and pale,
when the hour sounds,
I remember the old days and cry.
Thank you. Goodbye.
Until tomorrow.
And remember your assignments.
Will you look after Benjamin this afternoon?
Show him the castle?
There's the secretariat.
There are the 9th and 10th classes.
And 7 and 8 are along there.
Am I messing up
your free afternoon?
No. You're not.
- Well, I can imagine,
that you have something better to do.
- No. It's OK. Really.
And this is my favorite place.
Here you have your quiet.
And it smells good, too.
Up here are the classrooms for the lecture courses.
They're smaller,
because less people take them.
- Hold up a second. I need to rest.
Oh, of course.
Forgive me.
What are they doing there?
That's the fire fighting guild.
We're all in some group or other.
Drawing, photography, computers, pottery.
Everybody looks for a guild.
And where are you?
- In the school choir.
I never had a girlfriend.
And also never any real friends.
I am quite happy
if everyone leaves me alone.
And if nobody makes fun of me.
Speed junkie Isabelle loves summery
rides in her Cadillac.
But what is that? The engine stutters,
it's out of gas!
There she comes with her 2 big
reserve canisters,
on the search for a dashing
gas station attendant with a big faucet.
Well, little one? Like what you see?
Come on, let's go home.
We'll have a little fun together, OK?
1.70.
I'll take this, too.
So how is it with your dick?
It's not paralyzed, is it?
No.
You can be glad.
- I am.
Well?
- Well what?
Well, already fucked?
- None of your business.
Therefore not.
And so what if I haven't?
- Never mind. I was just asking.
No, I have not fucked yet.
Not even close.
You could ask me as well
whether I have flown to the moon.
I'm sorry if I've
hit on a sore spot.
It must surely be bad,
if one has never fucked.
'Night.
Who pays attention to the pretty ones?
Tits are interesting.
Yours, too, right?
I don't know what your problem with me is.
But it makes no difference to me.
I only ask that you treat me
normal just like everyone else.
I'm talking to you.
- I'm listening.
Do you think that would be OK?
- Sure. If you want,
we'll treat you quite normal.
- Thanks. That would be a big help.
And, for my part, we can start right now,
right, boys?
Mama? Hello. It's Benni.
- Mommie, they hosed me!
I'll call you back.
Don't look at me like that.
It's only water.
Are you mad now?
Everyone new here goes through this.
It's a ritual.
- It's a lousy, shitty ritual!
You wanted to be treated normal.
- Yes, but not like this!
Besides, you really hurt me.
Goddamned asshole.
My God, then just go home.
We're not in Kindergarten here.
Call your mom and go home.
I didn't call.
And with that I was accepted.
Janosch has a strange humor.
One must get used to it
and must always count on a test.
Sometimes he is like a little dog,
abandoned on the highway.
One never knows just when he'll bite.
Kugli is the best foosball player in the school.
His father owns a whole
soccer team in Bochum.
That his son is no soccer player
causes him great distress.
Everyone calls Florian "girl".
His parents died in an accident.
His grandmother looks after him.
She cuts his hair herself,
and buys him these great things.
Felix wants to become a musician.
Up to now he's still had no gig.
The band still argues about a name.
Troy has been here longer than all the others.
Often he says nothing for days.
Nobody knows what's going on with him.
He's the only one with his own room.
He doesn't even let the cleaning lady in to clean.
They have made an exception for him,
because he has strong family problems,
whatever that means.
Well, Benni?
What's up?
Homesickness.
Everybody feels that way at first.
You simply have to...
...drink it away.
We all want to go home.
But it just won't happen.
I believe, we are all lumps of meat,
in a thick, fat dog food box.
And Kugli is the fattest piece.
Shit!
Damn!
Youth sucks.
If I were 18 or 20 I could do what I want.
It's cool. We're heroes.
- What?
Yes.
Because the chicks go for us.
I haven't noticed.
- No, me neither.
Fat, crippled, silent, foolish.
The women run away.
Outcasts.
Oh jeez, Felix!
Oh, that stinks.
Benjamin? With which book did you
work at your old school?
Well, with a blue one.
And how far did you get in it?
About up to the middle.
But we also skipped some.
Then you require some tutoring.
- Probably.
I just have to figure out
how to fit everything in time wise.
Hopefully you're not squeezing in too much.
- No, of course not.
Come on, Benni. Here.
- Benni!
Pass the ball, don't shoot.
- Come on, come on.
Felix!
They are like antelopes.
- How so?
Elegant and inaccessible.
- Strictly forbidden.
So, how do you like her?
- Who?
Malen.
Yeah, she's all right.
- All right?
I think Malen is... tremendously expensive.
- What?
Yes, she is a luxury.
Everything about her is a luxury.
Her body, her clothes.
How she moves.
Don't you think so?
I hadn't thought about it that way.
Till now.
So long as I can remember,
I was always in love with a girl.
But I cannot remember
ever being together with one.
They always found me strange.
Up to now with a girl,
I had just as much luck as at school.
Namely none.
Only in watching did I always have luck.
In watching how others picked up girls
I had fallen in love with.
In that I was really good.
Yes.
See you later.
And?
- Papa. He'll be late.
Did he say why?
- Something at the office.
It has to be ready by tomorrow.
We should go ahead.
Do you know where my yoghurt is?
- What yoghurt?
You know exactly what I mean.
Up there, on the left, in the case.
Could be that I have eaten it.
- Wonderful! I had specially bought it
for this breakfast!
- Excuse me.
Do we argue now about yoghurt?
I wanted just once to have a peaceful
breakfast with my wife and my children.
- We do not argue about yoghurt!
So, why are we arguing then?
- You ignore our agreements!
So, we argue!
- I can go to Tengelmann's.
I'll buy a whole palette of yoghurt!
- It is not about yoghurt!
I have a case in the fridge...
Here, have your goddamned yoghurt!
Now I've lost my desire
to have breakfast with you!
They make me sick!
Be glad that you're in boarding school.
- But I'm not.
I'd much rather be at home.
- All they do is argue.
They're my family nevertheless!
- I renounce such a family.
You maybe. I can't.
- You can't always cling to mama.
I don't do that at all!
- Right! You've always done that.
But I'm just not normal!
I'm a cripple!
Now cut it out,
always feeling sorry for yourself.
With your goddamned cripple parade.
It gets on my nerves!
Malen or Marlen?
- Just Malen. Without the R.
Whenever I'm near her,
I always act like an idiot.
Then I start to sweat,
and talk like an imbecile.
So it is if one's in love.
- Yes, but it's so complicated.
If I might have your attention
for a moment.
We have a guest in Neuseleen.
This is Frau Westphalen.
She will be holding sexual education lessons
in the 9th classes.
She will be available during the next days to all
interested students.
Frau Westphalen has office hours each afternoon
in Room 202. You can bring your
worries and questions to her then.
- She's not completely unsexy.
We have here a list with 2 columns.
As you see, they are still empty.
What to put there,
I would like to hear from you.
All the terms that occur to you for the sex act.
Who has one?
Fuck.
I'll write that on this side.
Yes, here in front?
- Nail.
Nail.
Yes?
- Screw.
Screw.
That would go, I believe,
here, too, OK?
Shag.
- Shag.
If you have nothing against it,
also here.
The left side is still empty.
- I know one.
Have intercourse.
What is your favorite word?
- Favorite?
Crack.
The nutcracker.
Who might still have a suggestion?
Yes, you maybe?
I say: sleep together.
- Sleep together.
What strikes you? There is naturally
a relatively big imbalance.
I think we should still find
one or two appropriate words.
Who dares it then?
I know another one, but I'm not
sure about the placement.
Should I say it anyway?
- Sure. We'll decide together,
on which side it fits best.
- Drill?
So, what do we have here?
Now here are 1, 2, 3...
Screws also,
4 words from the craftsman's environment.
This is very remarkable, isn't it?
What does this tell us?
That sex is also a handcraft?
- Sex is a handcraft.
About that I would be happy
to talk with you.
I have never see a person
smoke so erotically.
Like so.
What are we doing this afternoon?
How about if we go to the sex tart,
during office hours?
And?
- Yes, and what?
Here comes the joke, or...
- I find there is already a joke involved.
Well, a joke would be if somebody
goes there and says: I am gay.
Benni, you?
- No.
Are you scared?
- Are you scared?
No? Then you go.
- OK, I'll go.
What do I get if I go?
A beer.
- A beer!
A beer? OK, if I go
and pretend that I'm gay,
I want a bottle of tequila.
- A bottle of tequila?
A bottle of tequila.
This is a little bit awkward for me.
- You can ask me anything.
Troy here... has made offers
to me a few times.
What kind of offers?
He has asked me whether I
would like to have sex with him.
Well... now I don't know,
whether that would be good for me.
I mean, can I simply try that out
sometime, or does the danger exist,
that over time...
I would become homosexual?
Do you share a room?
- Not yet.
But he has already put in the request.
Troy! What is it?
Was I not allowed to say that, or...
Nonsense...
Hey, Troy! Everything ok?
That was really too much.
You're always making fun of somebody.
Why do you always do that?
Just stop right there, OK?
He obviously didn't understand the joke. Sorry.
Nobody laughs at that shit.
- You have quite a different problem.
Me?
What problem am I supposed to have?
Kids hate themselves only for 2 reasons.
Either they're too fat,
or they've never had sex.
- Now cut it out.
I understand why you hate yourself.
- So what? Then I'm fat.
Thick or thin, what does it matter?
Are you such an asshole
that you have a problem with that?
- Sorry. I went a little too far.
Sorry.
Really, if you're like that,
Janosch,
I don't know whether we're friends.
- Why not?
We're really...
thick friends.
You asshole!
No, stop!
- Give! Give! Give!
Super.
How can one describe life in the boarding school?
It is one of many.
And I am getting accustomed to it.
I miss my mother, father and sister.
But remember,
I barely have time.
In the boarding school one is never alone.
One depends on the community.
Sometimes one feels very alive.
And sometimes one would like to die.
It's like a pretty cage with bars of gold.
One gets fed every day and has
no worries about the world outside.
Can I help you?
- No. That's ok.
It's nice here.
So, what are you doing today?
Nothing.
Except math tutoring.
Has it struck you,
that I'm not so good?
Sometimes I believe,
there are only 2 kinds of people.
One can do math,
and the other can't do math.
And I definitely belong
to the second.
I believe I do, too.
- I break out in a sweat,
over an equation with 2 unknown.
For what do I need 2 unknowns?
One is enough for me.
- Yes, it's not so easy.
Sometimes an unknown appears,
and then another and another.
One must keep a cool head.
What are you talking about?
- Math.
About life, I thought.
- Careful, there's a wasp.
Don't move.
Hi. Does anyone want to
come in the water?
We're talking.
- I think Malen would like
to come in the water with me.
- No! No! No!
First one to the bank...!
How does one please a girl?
Be daring or talk smartly?
Does one need a special talent?
- Hey, Benni! Come in the water!
I believe girls like active types.
Room stools don't get asked.
God would surely fly here.
- He doesn't do that at all.
He simply floats.
- I find God to be crazy.
Why is crazy?
- Well... he created women.
He's just a crazy lecher.
- He just knows what he wants.
We should live. And, whether it's right
or wrong, he should decide
when we stand before him.
- Do you mean we'll stand before him?
Of course.
Then I'll get myself an autograph.
Why should he give you an autograph?
I believe he gives everybody one.
- He simply trusts no one to ask.
Isn't that a little bit impolite?
- Stars feel flattered
when autograph hunters come, right?
The Cracker Game goes like this:
we jerk off in a row on a cracker,
and the one who doesn't hit it, loses.
- Well, and then?
You have to eat it. With the coating.
- What?
That's a little disgusting, isn't it?
- We didn't think it up.
You don't have to join in.
- Everybody joins in.
Otherwise I don't do it.
- He can stand a little bit closer,
then he hits easier.
- No, no special treatment.
Nobody gives me that.
You obey the rules, or you go.
Pitiful, Benjamin.
If you're going to copy,
you shouldn't choose Janosch.
You know what this means?
Another 6,
then the train departs for you.
With some colleagues, I believe,
the penny has not yet dropped.
We have one more assignment,
then the school year is at an end.
Janosch,
you have no reason to be witty.
Your work is second-worst.
Minus 5.
Benni,
I have another bottle of tequila for you!
And then let's clear out.
I have the itch. This is like prison.
I need a little change!
- Where then? Nothing's happening in the village.
Then we'll see to it
that something happens.
We could go to a strip club.
In Rosenheim there's one.
But they won't let us in there.
- No problem.
I know the son of the tenant. Olli.
- I'm in.
Now put your book away.
- Would you be quiet for once.
Jeez, Janosch!
- Math is a terror. It should be forbidden.
Jeez, now give the book back.
Cut it out, I need that.
Give it here!
Give me my book back!
- Hey!
- Hi!
And what are you doing now?
- Cooking Chinese. With Anna's wok.
We don't have time.
- Sweet.
Where are you going?
- To Rosenheim to the... Heimat Museum.
Should be really neat there.
- It's a field trip.
Hey, why don't you come along?
We bought a lot.
Yeah, sounds tempting, but...
- Benni.
We have to go.
- Ciao.
16-year-old boys are really embarrassing.
- Especially in a group.
How so?
Alone, as well.
Hi.
- What do you want?
This isn't the circus.
There's no kiddie show here.
I'm a friend of Olli's.
- Yes and?
Is Olli here?
- Do you see him?
I don't.
- When does the show begin?
At 9.
- Kind of late, no?
Come on,
we can do this, OK?
Can't you maybe
check again if Olli is here?
Are you from the boarding school?
OK.
But at 11 you're out of here, got it?
Excuse me...
Can we have another two gin and tonics?
We're definitely staying.
- Can you give me a light?
What time is it?
- Almost 9.
Almost 9? Super.
- Well? What'll it be for you, sweeties?
So, are you having fun?
- Yeah.
You're really handsome guys.
Especially you.
In two years you'll be a really
handsome man, you know that?
Excuse me...
Might I maybe buy you a glass of champagne?
Yes, of course you may.
It's starting!
Benni! I'll never forget this night!
- Me neither!
You know, you're the best!
- Yeah. And you, you are drunk.
Yeah!
But you're the best friend I ever had!
You're also the best.
- The very best yet!
We're all the best.
What's more, we should go up there.
Are you nuts?
- No way. Don't you trust me?
Sure!
Together?
Together.
- OK, come on.
Her pubic hair was black
and shaved like an arrow.
"I know that I know nothing",
some philosopher said.
And I had to remember that always.
I wanted to sink between her legs.
How should we tell the headmaster?
Benni had finally touched a woman?
He would not have understood that.
So it remained a violation
of the house rules,
and with a strong reprimand.
Now we finish the homework
and proceed with the calculation
of areas and angles of the pyramid.
Open your books, please,
to page 155.
Benjamin, where is your book?
I believe I have forgotten it.
- Then get it, please.
There's not a problem, is there?
Should somebody else get it for you?
- No.
I lost it.
- Oh, you lost your book.
I can tell you exactly,
where you lost your book.
Can you explain this to me?
Would you please come forward
to the blackboard?
Maybe you are so good now,
that you don't need your book anymore.
Benjamin.
I'll give you 2 more minutes.
Then, unfortunately, I feel forced...
Troy.
Hey!
How did this happen?
- He just fainted.
That's a complete malfunction, dude.
- He just has a small cut on his head.
It's just been stitched.
- Can I see him?
Falkenstein didn't give me a grade.
You really saved me
with your action.
Rosenheim was good, wasn't it?
Totally good.
Troy, what's up with you?
Why don't you ever talk?
I'm not gay.
Explain it to me.
Give me one good reason for this nonsense.
Who actually bought the drinks?
Something like that is expensive.
I was invited.
- Invited? By the women?
Have you... were you together with one?
- Mama, it wasn't a whorehouse.
They danced a little bit
while they stripped.
The headmaster had pity on me.
I was absolutely dumbfounded.
You may not fly off from school!
- Nonsense! It's not so bad.
Kids my age do stuff like that.
Luckily your math teacher likes you.
He will tutor you every afternoon.
No.
- He looks after you intensely!
He already irritates me every morning!
And now also in the afternoon?
Benjamin, I'll say this only once.
You will pass. Is this clear?
Shit.
I'll try.
That's all I can do.
I'm sorry if I
cause you trouble.
I don't know what's right
for you or not.
Have you told papa?
No.
He's not at home.
I didn't want to tell you at all.
Papa has a thing with a intern.
A 22-year-old girl.
This is all so mortifying.
Mama...
It's all right.
It's all right.
Damn! This is totally unfair.
How am I supposed to concentrate
with your stupid shirt in my face!
- What's wrong with my shirt?
It's completely tasteless.
- I don't make fun of your clothes!
I think my shirt has style.
And Malen likes boys with style.
Malen, Malen!
You've been flirting with her for months!
It's going nowhere!
- For such a girl one needs time.
And I'm taking my time.
- Yes! Oh my God!
Janosch?
I have to tell you something.
I'm also in love with Malen.
What are you grinning about?
- Nothing.
It was obvious.
Now what?
I can understand,
why you would fall in love with Malen.
Yeah.
But our friendship is more important.
- Right. That's how I see it, too.
I won't be offended, in any case,
if she decides on you.
If she decides on you,
I think it would be only decent,
if you make out in her room.
- No problem.
Hey. Want to come down to the lake with us?
- No, I can't. Math tutoring.
Oh, that's rough. On such a day.
- You can come after. OK?
But don't bring Falkenstein with you!
- Of course. We're inseparable.
Bye, until later!
- Bye!
Buckle up, please.
Do you think mathematics was
invented only to torment students?
And it has nothing at all
to do with you? But there you are mistaken.
Without mathematics this automobile would not go.
There would not even be this street.
Yes, half the world
would not exist at all.
"Time flies"
This is not correct, Benjamin.
Try again. Concentrate.
It just happens.
Yes, because your mind
is not in it.
Can't I maybe go early today?
Because it's Friday?
I believe you have not yet
grasped what is important for you.
Why are you here?
Because my mother wants it.
- Yes, but sometime,
you will have to decide
how your future looks.
Not your mother.
And not Janosch.
Can I go now?
Go on!
- Come on, Benni!
Go on, Benni! Dare you!
- Be careful, Benni.
Come on.
I'll help you back down.
Stop that.
This song is always the encore.
A mix of Marilyn Manson and Rammstein.
It's cool.
- Grab a few people,
and come to the concert tonight.
- Yeah, sure! Definitely.
Can I get in?
- Yes. May I?
Really good song structure.
Do you like it?
- Yeah. The hook line is really cool.
Have you pinched it from Wolfgang Petry?
- Are you kidding me?
No. It's really cool. But I know this.
- Hey, he wrote it himself.
We only do our own stuff.
- Why is the song called CRAZY?
Because you're always saying that.
- Therefore, I ask.
Does it somehow refer to me?
- Hey, this is so cool.
Hold on to that rawness!
- Now do you think it's good or shit?
That is Helge Schneider at 16!
You can go on today as the opening band!
Really? The opening band?
- Yes! Really heat the place up!
Yeah, of course! Definitely.
- Sweet. We'll do that. No question.
Life is very demanding.
Sometimes simply wonderful.
You must find the thread.
Nothing's ever too late.
Live what is to be lived,
before the sun sets.
Crazy, live crazy
without surrendering!
Crazy is everything that you do.
Whether you want it or dream,
whether you cry or laugh.
The crazy life,
no reason to surrender.
So crazy, insane, charmed!
So crazy, insane, charmed!
The next song
is by me.
It's called WILD GIRLS,
and...
Yes, now all the wild girls can dance...
if they want.
OK.
Good.
They dance like the savages
and look sexy.
Your crazy mood builds,
but I throw Senti out.
You will never
get a girlfriend.
They'll never fall
in love with you.
There's a girl that I like.
- Who's that?
I can't tell you.
I want...
...to write her a love letter.
Now I see that it's not so easy.
What are you asking me for?
- Should I maybe ask Kugli?
You're the... romantic.
- Simply write that you love her.
No, not something so direct.
But that's why it's a love letter.
- Yes, but I'm no Kafka,
or Bruce Willis. They can say something like that.
I need pseudonym.
You should write as Janosch, "I love you."
Not as somebody else.
OK. I'll write as a Janosch Schwarze, "I love you."
- What do you like most about her?
Try to praise the best of her.
And compare it to something.
For example, her eyes.
They are as deep and as blue as the sea.
Or her smile.
This is for you, like a sunrise.
Her mouth,
her lips.
This sounds like a bad pop song.
- Then write how you feel.
Should I write,
that I feel lousy?
Not what you feel now!
What you feel in relation to this girl.
What do you feel then?
That I want to nail her.
I feel that quite clearly.
Yes, that will certainly persuade her.
- Are you making fun of me now?
No. You do that yourself.
Are you staying here for the weekend?
- No, my father's picking me up soon.
I see. Then till Sunday.
- Till Sunday.
Sorry.
It's all wet?
At night I piss the bed.
Like a baby.
I can't help it.
When I look in the mirror I could puke.
Do you have a cigarette?
Are you ever afraid?
I'm afraid most of the time.
- Not of anything specific.
I mean, of life.
What am I to do when I have to leave here?
For me it goes too fast.
I can't keep up.
I understand what you mean.
But it's so short... Life.
You must simply grab hold,
no matter how short the thread is.
Everything that God--
- Knock it off with that bastard.
He doesn't help me.
He sits up there... far away.
Fat and satisfied.
Sometimes he helps us.
- I've looked at the Bible
quite thoroughly.
There's nothing about me in there.
I'm really sorry, Benni.
If he had told me earlier,
I would have been on time.
- It's OK. You're here now.
We'll have quite a nice day.
Only you, Paula, and I, yeah?
Now tell a little bit!
What's there to tell?
It's nice.
Your math teacher is really nice.
- That doesn't matter to Benni.
It should not fall back on him if we--
There's papa.
Come on, let's go!
- Pardon me if I start laughing.
Mama! Let's go.
- We're staying. Right, Benni?
I'd rather go, too.
- Your father should go.
Are we staying, or what?
- Eat your fish,
or don't you like it?
My Vitello Tonato is wonderful.
I never make this at home.
Do you want a little wine?
Hello.
That was quite original.
- I'm sorry, Juliane.
I didn't know that you--
- Come on, don't piss your pants.
Juliane...
Would you please leave us alone?
Your little friend is bored.
- This is not fair. In front of the children.
Youre not so sensitive in other matters.
Well, how is she in bed?
Have you done it with her more than once?
- Not so loud!
Does she consider you to be a glamorous guy,
who understands a lot about life?
Hello, I'm Melanie.
- Please go back to your seat.
I'd just like to say a brief hello.
- Hello. And now piss off!
Now you're really going too far.
- Ridiculous, on account of a pair of tits.
That's no way to talk.
- I don't give a shit!
We're going!
Will you get the check? We're going!
Now hold on, Juliane!
Let me at least talk with the children,
if not with you.
- Bla, bla, bla. Don't forget
that tomorrow you have a urologists appointment.
Get in.
Fuck off, I want to go.
Shit!
Shit!
No way! It tastes like shit.
- But the girls go for it.
I'm telling you, don't get it!
- I make the drinks, right?
You can worry about the chips.
- Get this instead. This is really better.
Hey, people!
- Girl, that'll look great on you.
Red, however, is completely vile.
- None of you
has the slightest notion of anything,
so please shut your mouths.
Sometimes I think we are all
principal actors in a
lousy photo love story:
CONFUSION OF FEELINGS.
What's happened up to now:
The clever leader of a boarding school clique,
Janosch, and his best friend,
the half-sided paralyzed Benjamin,
are in love with the same girl:
The flawless Malen.
Malen invites the boys to a
illicit party in the girls' room.
Benjamin totally wants to go to the party.
Just like his friend Janosch.
The melancholy Marie
is still trying to find out,
whether cool rocker Richi is serious,
or only toying with her.
Fetch me a Camel, little one.
- Sometimes he treats me really rottenly.
He could have at least said please.
- Both of them are really sweet.
I like Janosch's crazy actions.
Benjamin is quieter and more sensitive.
If only there was somebody
who had the qualities of both.
Without the handicap, of course.
That makes it really hard sometimes.
Today I'm going with Richi to Munich.
- Amazing. That underwear is over the top.
Your bra is, too.
Do you want to seduce Janosch or Benjamin with it?
Time to see who has
the better chance with Malen.
She's a really cool girl.
- You bet. And you're a cool friend.
You, too, Janosch!
What happens next:
Will Marie and Richi go to Munich?
Will Janosch conquer Malen?
Or will Benjamin finally have the courage
to confess his love to Malen?
Hey.
- Hello.
You look great when you dance.
- Thanks, it's fun, too.
Can I have a sip?
Sure.
-Thanks.
Were you with Falkenstein?
- No.
It's really hard there.
He has an iguana
in the middle of room.
And, he lives there all alone
with this iguana in the apartment.
And?
- Yeah, he... he just lies there.
And stares at me all the time.
- Who?
Falkenstein. Nonsense.
The iguana! Like I just said.
Funny.
Want to dance?
No.
Stay for a bit.
Can we talk alone for a moment?
- Now?
Yes. It's important.
- Very well.
Do you remember,
the day when we...
Well, when I...
jumped from the diving platform?
- Yes.
I was scared to death
when I climbed up there.
And I immediately wanted
to climb back down.
There was only... one reason
why I jumped from there.
The reason--
Anna! Can I use your phone?
- Yes.
You're sure that Richi
has already left?
Yes, he was supposed
to pick me up.
No.
Yes, OK.
Thanks.
Bye.
- Well?
The motherfucker left
an hour ago for Munich.
You can't drive there now.
You'll miss the concert anyhow.
Why does he do this?
Now I'm stuck here,
at this crappy kiddie party.
Watch out,
you asshole!
Excuse me,
I didn't see you.
Don't get all bent out of shape, Benni.
- Piss off! You're getting on my nerves!
What's your problem?
- You know exactly what my problem is!
Are you pissed now
because of Malen?
Hey, Benni. This is a party, OK?
You can relax now.
Man, I just can't.
Is it my fault,
that you're such a coward?
I can't help you there.
You have to do this yourself!
Shit. Why does it go shitty for me,
and you...
You can stick your fucking advice
up your ass!
I thought that we're friends,
Benni.
Are we friends?
- You have no friends at all!
You have only stupid ass-lickers,
who follow you around.
OK,
now listen up.
For sure, I'm drunk,
but I'll tell you this now:
She is not the right one for you, OK?
Why? Because she doesn't love you.
She's only nice to you because
you're a half-side spastic, OK?
OK, Benni.
OK.
What is it?
Are you sick?
What's wrong with you?
Leave me alone.
You don't understand anything.
Bathroom's down there, Benni.
Everything OK?
- I burned my hand.
Can I have a sip?
- Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Tastes shitty.
Have any more beer?
Beer's all gone.
We really should have bought more.
How long have you been here?
- Three years.
And?
Do you like it?
Well...
For me it's almost over.
My mother's going to England,
and I'll go with her.
You have no feeling
in your arm at all?
And you feel nothing?
- No.
Well...
A little bit, but...
That is...
It's as if it had fallen asleep.
How sometimes your leg falls asleep.
I only feel that which hurts me.
I don't want to hurt you.
What I said tonight,
I didn't mean it.
I'm such a goddamned idiot.
That was a real piece of luck, Benni.
You nailed a first-class girl.
It hurt.
- She said that?
No, it...
hurt me.
Well...
Now at least you have it behind you.
Now you're grown up.
But nobody asked me
whether I wanted to grow up.
Was it really
so bad with Marie?
I mean, was... everything
totally horrible?
It was absolute shit.
But it was also the best
that I've had so far.
Everything OK?
Sure.
My future looks quite rosy, I think.
Soon I'll be 17.
That ought to change something.
With the last journey home,
I got to know a girl.
Maybe that was a beginning.
But I don't know.
- Is there an empty seat here?
She found me quite strange,
she thought.
I told her that many girls think that of me.
She found that quite strange at first.
I don't know if anything
will come of it.
I didn't even bother to take the last math test.
It was pointless.
Falkenstein would have had to
invent a 7 or 8 for me.
Janosch just managed a 5
and was moved into the 10th class.
For me, however, the summer festival
was farewell to Castle Neuseleen.
I have discovered a great school for you.
A kind of special school.
Not in the sense of a special school,
but mathematics, physics and chemistry...
are taught there limitedly.
- I will not go to this school.
I don't want to be the new one again
who recites its motto.
Now is not a good time to tell her this.
But I will tell her.
For sure.
Hey. This is Carsten.
- Hello.
This is Benni and Janosch.
Carsten studies architecture
in Constance.
He came especially for the ball.
- The castle is worth the trip.
Wonderful facility.
You're lucky to go to school here.
You live here, too, right?
That's great, isn't it?
I believe we'll
hit the refreshment bar.
Bitter?
Troy?
Troy!
Didn't your parents come?
- No.
Don't you want to come down?
Everyone's there but you.
It's my last night here.
It'd make me happy.
OK.
I'll see.
How can one describe life in the boarding school?
It's difficult for me.
Everything here is done for you.
You just have to... be happy.
It's funny.
Today is my last day,
and I'm wearing this thing for the first time.
- But it looks good on you.
Yours, too.
Girl, yours makes you look
years older. Really.
Want something to eat?
Those are real whoppers, hm?
- Dig in.
So that you get big and strong.
What are your plans now?
No idea.
Travel around by train...
The main thing
is you don't forget us.
No.
I certainly won't forget you.
- Right. We're just...
a few stupid boarding school students.
- Only if you're as famous as Lady Di,
then nobody forgets you.
And if you die, everyone howls
and throws flowers on your grave.
I promise high and holy
that I won't forget you.
How could I forget you?
With everything we've been through.
Here you all are.
What's this?
Who starts?
- Always the one who asks, Anna.
Yes, do it.
- No. Malen starts.
Right, Malen starts.
- Go on, Malen.
Very well.
Benni.
We have a parting gift
for you to consider.
And...
now you have to endure it.
At 16
I said softly:
I want,
want to be big, want to win,
I want to be happy,
never lie.
At 16
I said softly:
I want,
want everything...
or nothing.
For you,
it should rain red roses,
all miracles
should meet you.
The world,
should reshape itself,
and keep her worries
to herself.
And later,
I said still,
I wish,
to see a lot, understand,
get to know, preserve.
And later, I said still,
I wish,
to not be alone... and yet be free.
For you,
it should rain red roses,
all miracles
should meet you.
Luck...
should behave kindly,
it should govern
your destiny with love.
The world looks up to my window.
With open eyes all dusty and shy.
I am up here on my cloud.
I see you coming,
But you pass by.
Yet now there's no more pain.
No, now there's no more pain.
And everything stays quiet,
And no storm arises if I see you.
It is past, bye-bye June Moon.
It is past, it is past, bye-bye.
Two thousand hours I waited.
I counted and damned them all.
I drank, I smoked, and I prayed.
I looked upstream and downstream for you.
Yet now there's no more pain.
Now there's no more pain.
And everything stays quiet,
And no storm arises if I see you.
It is past, bye-bye June Moon.
It is past, it is past, bye-bye.
Yet now there's no more pain.
Now there's no more pain.
And everything stays quiet,
And no storm arises if I see you.
It is past, bye-bye June Moon.
It is past, it is past, bye-bye.
It is past, bye-bye June Moon.
It is past, it is past, bye-bye.
