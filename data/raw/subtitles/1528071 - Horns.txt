Everyone in townnalways took me for an outsider.
I didn't care.
The only thing
that mattered was her.
She was my garden of Eden,
and God knows how beawutiful
 it was until that night.
No, no one is born evil,
the Devil himself
 was a fallen angel.
But sometines,
 when you go through hell,
the only way out is to walk
 deeper into the fire.
 Are you horny?
 Yeah, I'm getting warmer.
 Oh!
No.
- Yes.
I'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life.
Just love me
for the rest of mine.

Hey, Ig, what does it feel
like to get away with murder?
Want to comment on the fire
at the lab in Tacoma last night?
Have you heard that the
police have a new witness?
Ask God to save your soul
for what you did to her!
I should ask the Devil
to punish whoever
the fuck killed her.
- Hi, this is Lee,
please leave a message.
Hi, Lee, please,
can you meet me
at my parents' house
in half an hour.
I really need to talk to you.
Pick up the phone, man, come on.
Are you proud of me, mom?
I'm so famous,
people follow me
everywhere I go.
 Come inside, sweetie.
You just can't talk
to those reporters.
They'll take whatever you say
and just twist it around.
But if I don't talk
to them, it looks like I
have something to hide, right?
How's Lee
working out for you?
You still think
he's up to the job?
Yes, he's keeping
me out of jail,
at least for the time being,
which is some kind of triumph.
I know he's
an old friend of yours,
but you don't have to settle
for a public defender.
I've got the money, I will hire
you the best lawyer in Seattle.
Every other lawyer we talked
to wanted me to take a plea.
Lee is the only one
who believes I'm innocent.
Just don't talk to
any more reporters, please.
And don't admit
anything.
I don't have anything
to admit to, dad.
We don't care what happened.
You're our son.
That's all
that matters.
- Sit back down, Ig.
- If you think for a second
that I might've killed her,
then why are you protecting me?
Because if I did anything
to her, I'm a fucking monster.
 I got to go.
 Ig, look, I...
I don't have to go
back on the road
ext week if you
don't want me to.
You got to earn a living.
I'll sort things out.
Except I need you
to stay, Terry.
The whole family needs
to put up a united front for Ig.
Hey, buddy,
how is it going?
- Lee.
 Lee,
if you want any food,
we've got plenty of leftovers
from lunch.
- I grabbed something
on the way, thank yhou.
How are you guys doing?
- Yeah, hum,
Lee, what happened
at the lab in Tacoma?
One of the reporters this
morning told me it burned down.
The samples from Merrin's
body were destroyed.
All of the murderer's
blood and DNA--
That's a fucking
disaster for us, right?
That means there's no evidence
anybody else killed her.
It's not ideal, but there's
no need to panic at this point.
And who is this new witness?
What is that?
I'm trying to figure
that out today and I'm also
gonna get your confession
to the police thrown out.
Yeah, good. You know
I never confessed to them.
They're just looking
for any way to lock me up
for the rest of my life.
Hey, it's okay, Lee can
fix anything, right?
We'll see about that. And
you don't have to convince me.
Ig, I believe you.
You don't think
I'm capable of murder?
Just put me in a room with
the guy who really killed her.
Littl early for you to start
drinking at this time of day.
They put me on leave
at the station.
Apprently, most commuters
don't like it when their
DJ is a murder suspect.
Yeah, so maybe you should
take your business elsewhere.
No offense, but you make
the other customers
uncomfortable.
You're actually saying I make
these guys uncomfortable?
Come on, Iggy deserves
a drink as much as anybody.
 Thank you.
 More than anybody.
Thanks, Glenna, but you
don't need to stand up for me.
And if you want to grab
a drink in a friendlier place,
I get off at five.
- I appreciate the offer.
But it seems like
I'm better off...
drinking alone.
Thank you all for coming
tonight to pay tribute
to our dear girl Merrin.
I know that Dale
would like to say
a few words
to welcome you.
 Well, uh...
It's, uh...
It's real good
to see you all here.
The truth is I haven't
felt much like...
getting out of bed
in the morning since Merrin...
Ig Perrish murdered her and
he's still walking the streets.
I treated him like a son
practically all his life,
and then he killed
my little...
...my little girl.
As long as he's free,
there's no way that her soul
can be laid to rest.
So let us all
bow our heads
in prayer.
Thank you for coming.
- Jesus Christ, Ig.
- Leave me alone,
Glenna.
- What are you thinking,
coming out here?
They could've seen you.
She went to church
every fucking Sunday!
She wore a cross
around her neck,
and did it make
any difference?
No!
God turned a blind eye
and let her die out here
alone and afraid.
- All right.
- Fuck God!
For whatever reason
in this crazy fucked up world,
I was being punished.
When they lookef at me,
they saw a devil.
And maybe I did too.
And now I had to look
like one.
What...
Ah!
 Ha! Ha! Ha!
You were on the can
for a long time.
Are you
still drunk?
How do I look? Did you notice
anything unusual?
 You mean the horns?
 Shit, so they're real?
Fuck!
 Ig...
Can I...
Can I have another donut?
 Why are you asking me?
 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6.
You think I'll be OK
if I eat 6 more donuts?
Yeah, do whatever
you like.
 Thank you.
I don't like it.
My stomach hurts.
Could I have another one?
Why would you eat another one
if your stomach hurts, Glenna?
Because I want
to get really fat.
I'm worthless
anyways.
Nobody will screw me
without being totally drunk.
Everybody in this town
thinks that I'm trtash.
 That's not true, Glenna.
You never would've screwed
me if you weren't blind drunk.
- Well...
- I could tell you were thinking
about Merrin
the whole time.
 Glenna,
I've got no excuse
for last night.
I just need to know if
I may eat the rest of this box?
- Yeah, go ahead, pig out.
- Mmm...
You know what, Glenna, I think
I'll just be taking off now.
Alright.
Hi.
- What can I do for you?
I need Dr. Renald
to look at something.
 Well,
that sure doesn't
look right.
I'll need you
to fill out some forms.
You know, for
what it's worth,
I'd like to kick my daughter
right in her spoiled ass.
Do you think I should?
- No, of course not.
Why would you even ask me that?
Maybe I ought to just leave
her here and drive away,
divorce my husband.
I could fuck my golf
pro again. Ha! Ha!
 Excuse me?
I've never been
with a jigaboo before.
But it's true what they
say about black cocks.
I call it
my five-iron.
 Here you go.
I feel like
I have to yell
at that girl's mother.
I know it's not her fault
that her daughter is a screechy
puke, but really, now.
Go ahead.
Why not?
Ma'am? Do you think
you could show
some fucking consideration and
take your daughter out of here
where we won't have
to listen to her screaming?
 What did you just say to me?
I said you should take
that shrieking pig of
yours by the hair
and drag her the fuck
out of here!
Fuck you! Shove it up
your ass, you dried-up old twat!
Come on, you don't want to do
this in front of your daughter--
 I hate Mommy.
I want to burn her
in her bed with matches.
I want to burn her
all up gone!
You want to stop
pomping that now?
 Sorry.
My boyfriend is seeing
this girl on the side.
She works at the Bradlees
down by the Marina.
On my lunch break, I'm thinking
I should drive over there
and key her Saab. Then leave
dog shit on the driver's seat.
Or maybe I should just take
a dump on the seat myself.
Ignatius Perrish.
Long time no see.
So what brings you
in here this morning?
Well, can you
see anything
that might be
wrong with me?
You mean besides
your horns?
No, that's exactly what
I mean. So you can see them?
Shouldn't you both
be shocked or something? I mean,
if I saw someone with horns,
I'd piss down my leg.
- Well,
they're kind of
hard to remember.
Whenever I look away
from you for a second,
I sort of forget
that you even have them.
 What are they?
Could they be
cancerous?
Could they be some
tumor our something?
They're definitely
cause for concern.
They look inflamed.
Do they hurt?
 Yes, like hell.
 Ha! Ha! Ha!
Hum. All right.
You know how I think
we should proceed?
- How?
I think I should grind
me up some OxyContin
and have a little snort.
I'd share, we could get
fucked up together.
No! Please, can you just focus
on my problem for a second?
I'll try.
But it's hard.
I keep thinking about
this girl, Nancy,
that my daughter
hangs out with.
God, I want
her ass so bad.
For Christ's sake,
how are we going to deal
with these things
on my head?
You fucking
patients.
All you care about
is yourselves!
 Listen, Doctor,
just saw the
goddamn horns off.
Are you sure
this is gonna work?
Not at all,
actually,
but it'll be fun to try.
- What?
Now, just
breathe normally.
- No, OK. Doc, please--
- Chut!
If you're not sure,
we can just, uh...
 It will be okay.
Just breathe.
Just breathe.
Everything's gonna be fine.
That's right.
Have you seen that girl
before? What is she doing?
I think it's
Morse code.
"Stop looking at my legs
or I'll give you
a black eye."
 Go forth in peace.
 Here we go!
- Spread its legs.
- Put them in
one by one, guys.
- I'm telling you,
she was doing Morse code.
She was sending me a message.
- I didn't think
you even liked girls, Ig.
Always thought you were a fag.
- Shut up, Meatbag.
- What's so special about her?
It's like you all
never saw a girl before.
You'll want
to find cover
or else you'll all be
wearing turkey dinner.
 What's wrong?
Shit. Maybe
it got wet.
Gimme me the lighter.
Sometimes it messes.
Now, you're really
a meatbag!
What are we gonna blow up now?
- We're not blowing up
anything else today.
I'm saving my last cherry
for something special.
Come on, Eric,
don't be a dick.
The only way I'm giving up
this cherry bomb
is if one of you homos
climbs in that shopping cart
and rides it
down the log ramp.
- I'll do it, Meatbag.
- Naked.
 I'm gonna to do it, Eric.
 Sure, you are.
 Ig, don't, don't!
Don't be ridiculous,
you don't have to do this.
You'll get a cherry.
Come on, man.
One left.
♪♪- Don't do this,
please. You're gonna
kill yourself.
 Oh, shit.
 Ig! Ig!
Oh my God, he fell
under the logs!
Do something,
do something!
What... he should
be up by now.
 Oh my God!
Ig! Ig!
Hey, Terry, your brother here
is a total fucking lunatic.
 You fucking idiot!
If Lee hadn't been here--
- Did you do mouth to
mouth, faggot?
- Shut up.
- Now give me the cherry.
- No way.
I said ride down naked. You wore
tighty-whities and sneakers.
Eric, give him
the fucking cherry.
So you like that
new girl in church?
- I don't know her yet.
- I like her too.
She's not like all the other
girls around here. She's
not like Glenna.
She hangs out with her brother
Eric because she thinks
that's the only way
guys will like her.
But they just think
she's trash.
Maybe I should give her
the cross. I mean, I'm
the one who fixed it.
 No! You can't do that.
What will you
give me for it?
Do you want
my cherry bomb?
You fixed
my cross?
 Yeah.
Something,
you know,
happen to your mom?
 She died last year.
That's why my dad
and I moved here.
- Did she...
She had cancer. Is it okay if
we don't talk about it anymore?
 Yeah, I understand.
Thanks again
for fixing my cross.
 Ig! Did you give
the cherry bomb to Lee?
- What happened?
- It blew up in his hands!
- What?
 Where is he?
 He's in that room.
Hey, look at
the bright side,
I've still got
eight fingers.
I'm sorry.
I wish I never gave you-
You're not going to tell
your mom who gave you
the cherry bomb, right?
Don't worry. It's all
gonna be fine.
I'm glad one good thing
happened today.
- Where are you taking me?
- Come on. Can't wait
to show you.
Come on, come on, come on!
Don't fall off.
Come on, come on!
Don't slip on any roots, OK?
Are you sure you know
where you're going?
- See?
- Wow.
How did you find
this place?
Just walking through
the woods one day.
Come on.
This is where I come
when I want to be alone.
So now I'll know
where to find you.
We got great hidings
where we can have food,
blankets, anything else
you want to hide.
- So you're a Bowie fan too.
- Yeah.
I didn't tell you
the truth.
Lee's the one
who fixed your cross.
He wanted to give it back
to you, but I traded him
the cherry bomb instead.
So it's all my fault.
 How is it your fault?
If he gave it back to you,
then he would've been
the one who--
You think you traded me
for the cherry bomb?
You think that's
how things work?
I left it there
for you.
It wasn't
an accident.
I...
I wanted you to find it
and give it back to me.
I wanted you to be
the one who...

What the hell
is going on here?
Hey!
- I was going to operate,
but I sort of
got distracted.
We asked you if we
could have sex instead
and you said it was okay.
- How could I possibly say
it was okay?
I was under anesthesia!
- You sort of nodded your head,
so we assumed
you thought it was okay.
 Father Mould?
- Get away from me.
Leave me alone.
- I'm not here
to hurt you. Please,
tell me what can
I do to stop this? How
can I make them go away?
You killed that
innocent girl,
Merrin. There's nothing I can
do. So please, leave me alone!
- I didn't kill her, father,
and now people are telling
me all these things
I don't want to hear.
There's no prayers you can say?
I'll try anything.
- You did this to yourself.
- What?
- You've turned away from God.
You've cast yourself
into the darkness.
- I didn't do anything wrong!
- Every devil
used to be an angel. You've
fallen from grace forever.
When Satan was banished from
Heaven, he was cursed to crawl
the earth
like a snake!
There's no hope
for you.
 What, so that's it?
There's no way you can help me?
- I've got a rope
in that shed
over there.
I can take you out
to that tree where Merrin died
and I...
I can string you up.
Unless you'd
like to do
the decent thing
and hang yourself.
What do you say?
 Lee.
Everyone in this town
is going fucking crazy.
The town's always
been crazy.
I think it's because of me
and these goddam horns.
 Yeah.
The what?
 The horns.
These horns.
What are you
talking about?
Wait, can't
you see them?
Are you high
right now?
Have you been hanging
out with Terry?
 So maybe...
Maybe the horns just
don't work on good people.
You've been under an inhuman
amount of stress recently.
And maybe you're just starting
to go a little, you know...
 And if I'm this crazy
and I can
imagine all this,
then I could easily have got
so drunk that I blacked out
that night,
and killed Merrin,
and just forgot
all about it, right?
Mom?
Mom?
I didn't know
you were coming.
I didn't know
where else to go, mom.
Something really bad
is happening to me.
 Oh, sweetie,
why couldn't you go
somewhere else?
 What?
What do you mean?
I don't want to hear
about all your problems.
I don't want to know.
- Mom.
Sometimes, when you talk,
I just want to sing.
♪ La la la la la ♪
What are you
doing? Mom?
I want to hold my breath
until you go away!
Jesus Christ,
mom, don't...
Don't...
Stop it!
I'm going to write
you a letter...
a really
nice letter
about how much
dad and I love you,
and how great it
would be for both of us
if you would
just go.
But where?
Where can I go?
I don't know. Didn't
you always want to go hiking
in Alaska? Didn't you
want to go to Vietnam
to teach English?
Those were things Merrin
and I were going yo do
together, you know that.
I don't care where you go. As
long as I don't have to see you.
Because every time I see you,
it just makes me so...
unhappy.
I just want to be happy
again, sweetheart.
 I understand.
And I don't want you
to be my son anymore.
 Oh.
Are you going
to go away?
 Ig.
I thought I
heard you coming.
Yeah, OK,
let me walk you
through this, dad. This
is the part where you
tell me something awful
you've been keeping
to yourself. Just say it
and we'll get it
out of the way.
I don't know why you
turned out like this.
With your brother,
it's easier.
We can always
play music together.
But with you, I never
know what to say to you.
Well.
That's not bad,
all things considered.
I think
about Merrin
What a beautiful
girl she was.
I loved her,
you know,
in a way.
I envied you.
I was never in
love with anyone
the way you two were
in love with each other.
You couldn't hear
her laugh without smiling.
It was like music.
And when I think about
what you did to her...
 And you never thought,
maybe, just maybe,
that I didn't do it?
 Of course not.
You're trying to
get away with murder.
And the worst part is,
I'm helping you do it!
What? What do
you mean by that?
I went to call
to the guy who runs
the state's forensics lab.
Are you telling me
you got your friend to
set that fire to the lab?
When the world comes
for my son with the knives out,
it's my job to
stand in the way!
Dad, the evidence you got
burnt up could've saved me!
How could
you do it?
She was one of the
best people I ever knew!
She was my favorite
thing about you.
 Yeah, me too.
So if you knew
how much I loved her,
then how could you ever
believe I'd kill her?
Isn't that
why you killed her?
Because you loved
her so much
and you lost her%
Way more people kill out
of love than out of hate.
- What's going on, Ig? Did you
 go home like I asked you to?
Yeah, and it was
very enlightening.
Did you know that my dad
got his friend to start
the fire in the lab?
- Hypothetically,
if I did know,
I would legally be required
 to tell the police.
But maybe that fire
 was a blessing in disguise.
How? How was it
a fucking blessing?
If the lab hadn't burned down,
that evidence would've
cleared me, Lee!
OK, I know it's rough for you
staying at your house,
so why don't you just
 take the keys to my place,
 you can crash on the couch.
No, I'm fine. I've actually
got a lot to do.
I've got to figure out
who really killed Merrin
and get him to confess.
- How are you planning to do?
Lately, I can be
pretty fucking persuasive.
Hey, Ig, nice look
for you. Showing
your true nature?
- You know, guys, I'd really
appreciate it if you'd fuck off.
- Ig, admit you killed her, it'd
be such a huge scoop for me--
- Good to know
your journalistic integrity
is unimpeachable.
- You confess to me,
I could get out of
stupid local news.
- I got an idea.
How about you guys beat the shit
out of each other?
And the winner gets
an exclusive interview with me.
Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha!
I thought I told you
I don't want you coming
around here no more,
Ig.
Oh! Al, you don't want to do
that, you'll get arrested.
I don't give a flying
fuck if I get arrested.
Why don't you get me a whisky?
You only want the money.
What I really want is
to burn this place down
and collect the insurance.
- Can you not burn down the bar
right now? I need
your help for something.
If anyone knows anything
about who killed Merrin,
you're gonna have
to tell me now.
Only thing I ever killed
was a couple of dogs.
I run a dogfighting ring out of
the supply room back there.
- Jesus,
Al, I don't want to know that.
- I've been unemployed
for three months
and I hate my life,
so I can
sure understand
wanting to kill someone.
- Rob, that's not what I meant.
I really want to show
everybody my dick.
 Oh, don't--
 I want that all the time.
I want that all the time.
- The only thing I know,
I got a cousin
who's a cop
and he knows
who the new witness is.
This waitress who served you
the night Merrin got killed
says she saw you
drive back to the restaurant
and drag Merrin
into your car.
 Thanks a lot, Stan.
 Ha! Ha! Ha!
Ha! Ha! Ha!
 Hey, my interview?
Hey, my interview!
 OK.
OK, guys, so, uh,
you're gonna come tomorrow night
to the diner at about nine?
I will hope we've
done de deed by then,
and then we can
go out celebrate.
You want me to
bring any goodies?
No. I think me and Merrin
are going to be happy enough
tomorrow without
stimulants, I hope.
Yeah, well, I'm a musician
and we always need stimulants.
- I can understand that.
- And I'm a state employee,
subject to
random drug tests.
You're not rushing into this?
- Rushing into it? How am
I rushing into it?
We've been going out
since we were kids.
- Hi.
- Hey.
Hey.
Oh, is everything
all right?
What's wrong, Merrin?
I really don't know
how to say this,
so I'm just gonna
go ahead and say it.
I'm moving
to Los Angeles.
 That's great!
I can get a leave of absence
from the radio station easy.
I want a change
of scene too.
No, that's not
what I'm talking about.
I think we need
to stop seeing each other.
- Hey, lovers!
- What?
- You guys
are ready to order?
- I don't think we're
quite decided yet.
 OK, I'll come back.
I don't
understand.
I thought everything
was going great.
It's just we've
never had a chance
to be apart. I've
never had a chance
to think about
what I want for my life.
OK, but I know
what I want.
I want the life we've
been dreaming about
since we were kids.
That's the problem.
We've been dreaming about that
since we were kids.
And we're adults now
and we need to start
being practical.
I don't know what
you mean by that.
I don't want to ever be the
reason for any of your regrets,
Ig.
- How many times
have we talked about
getting married?
About what we're going
to name our kids?
- I'm not even sure
if I want to have kids.
- What? You sounded
pretty into it the last
8000 times we talked about it!
How many girls
have you been with?
You know the
answer to that.
- Just me.
- Yeah.
No one does that, Ig.
No one on the whole planet
does that.
You need to see other people
so that you can figure out
if I am the one
that you want to be with.
I don't want
to see other people!
Is that what you want?
Are you in love
with somebody else?
How far has it gone?
Answer me!
How far has it gone?
Have you already fucked him?
- Please, Ig.
No, tell me. Tell me
everything that happened!
I need to know. Have you
fucked him already?
- Why are you asking me this?
- Because
I want to know. I want to know
everything. It'll make it easier
for me to hate you!
 You deserve better.
Finally, something
we agree on.
Please,
I'm gonna be lost.
I'm not in love
with you anymore.
Come on, please.
We're not done
talking about this.
 Please, let go.
Please.
Yeah, what are you
looking at?
Sir, we're going to have to
ask you and your wife to leave.
 She's not my wife.
She's just someone
I used to fuck!
Hey, Ig, how'd it go?
You already proposed?
- Party's over, Terry. Go home.
- What the hell are you
talking about?
Hey, I thought we were
going to celebrate tonight.
What's going on?
Ig, what the fuck
are you doing?
Merrin, you
all right?
 Morning, Ig.
Can you roll down the
window so we can talk?
 Hey, Meatbag,
what's up?
When was the last time
you saw Merrin, Ig?
What's happened
to her, Eric?
What makes you think
something happened to her?
Fuck, it's
all my fault.
Anything that happened to her,
it's all my fucking fault.
 Oh, I gotta go.
You can sit
wherever you want.
Wait, you're that guy.
Ig Perrish.
Yeah. I heard you've been
telling lies about me
to the police.
 Yeah, I have.
And you know, I don't feel even
a little bit bad about it.
- You want to tell me exactly
what you said to them?
- I told them
that your girlfriend forgot
her jacket, so I followed her
in the parking lot and
I saw you drive back and scream
that you were
going to kill her.
- But you know that's not true!
And that I saw you
drag her into your car
and you drove off.
Why the hell
would you say all that?
Because I want to be in
all the newspapers and on TV!
I want to be the star
witness at your trial.
I'm pretty enough
to be on TV.
Especially if I get my tits
lifted the way I want.
You're just
a fucking crazy liar!
I know I am.
I'm so bad. I'm bad.
Sometimes when people
ask me what you did,
I tell them that after
you beat her brains in,
you turned her over and
you fucked her in the ass.
You should see their
faces when I say that.
Everyone loves
a good sex murder.
You're insane! My brother
was here that night and
he saw me leave alone.
I'm gonna release
my own sextape and be
on every variety show.
I'll be in
USmagazine, smiling.
 Hey, Glenna!
- How's it going?
- How do you think it's going?
Because it's going
worse than that.
Right?
- Oh, excuse me.
I think I had too many
donuts this morning.
Yeah, you did.
I was there.
 When we both laid?
No, this morning. You
don't remember any of that?
 Well, no.
I must've been
really drunk, so...
Why don't you let me suck
your cock in the men's room?
I'd really like that.
And I bet it'd make you
feel better.
- No, Glenna.
Thanks, but
not right now.
 Thing is, Ig,
I've always been
in love with you.
Ever since
we were kids.
But I guess you
know that, right?
I guess I did kind
of know that, yeah.
 Sorry.
I just wish that I could
leave this town and...
What's
stopping you?
- You!
- Me? No, it can't be me,
right? No.
Put this shit whole town
in your rear-view mirror and
do womething good for yourself.
Hey.
Ig, I didn't know
you were here. Jesus Christ,
what the fuck is on your head?
- They're horns, crazy story.
Listen, Terry.
- You didn't help me.
No, just listen
to me, Terry.
The waitress from the diner,
she's going to the cops
and telling them
that she saw me drag Merrin
into my car and drive away
from the diner that night.
I know for a fact
that's not true.
You know that, and I know
that, but how the hell
we're gonna prove that?
I mean, Merrin left the diner
with me that night.
What do you mean,
she left the diner with you?
You told me you never saw her
that night at all.
I didn't kill her, Ig.
I would never hurt her.
- What you talking about, Terry?
- I was just too scared.
Tell me, Terry!
 So...
What just happened
with you and Ig?
I don't want
to talk about it.
Sure. You're shaking,
you're a mess.
Hey, hey, why don't
you take one of these?
Just take one, they're fine.
Take the edge off.
- I don't want any pills.
I need to feel what
I'm feeling tonight.
 God, you're beautiful.
You know that?
 Can you pull over?
I need to get out of the car.
- Wo, wo, wo, I didn't...
Look, it's the end
of the world out there.
I want to go
for a walk!
Are you trying to get
yourself killed? Hang on!
- Thanks for the ride, Terry.
- Come back!
I'm fine now.
I promise, OK?
 Merrin!
Don't be ridiculous,
where are you going?
I'll wait for you!
What the fuck...
Fuck.
Merrin?
Merrin!
Merrin!
Merrin?
 How could you?
What did you do to her?
I didn't kill her.
I loved Merrin too.
Well, if you didn't
kill her, then who did?
Oh, fuck!
 We got a call
on the radio about some kind of
altercation going on out here.
We had a pretty good idea
who was responsible.
Listen, Eric,
this is all my fault.
Maestro, break time
is over. Let's go!
Go on back inside, Terry,
none of this concerns you.
Yeah, go back inside,
you motherfucking coward!
You better calm down,
Ig, you don't want
to be resisting arrest.
We'd be inclined to use force.
What would you arrest me for?
I got in a fight
with my coward brother.
Is that a crime?
The thing is, this club
is across the county line.
which means
we caught you
fleeing jurisdiction.
- God,
they talk about the most obvious
kind of trumped-up charge.
 Go back inside.
- Fuck you, Eric.
- Me?
I wish we could
bring you in for worse.
I wish I could plant
something on you.
Like maybe a piece
of her dress.
That way I could put
you away for good.
Jesus, Eric, you've known
me all my life. You know
that I'd never
hurt her!
Bullshit, Ig,
you confessed to me.
Everyone in town
saw you fighting with her
the night she was killed!
That's not what happened.
I said whatever happened to her
was my fault because I ran
off on her, I left her alone.
Whatever that waitress
told you is lies!
You listen to me,
asshole.
I'm gonna make sure you get
punished for everything
you did to her,
even if I have
to beat you to death
with my own hands.
- Do it, beat him to death.
That'll give me something
to whack off to tonight,
only I'll be picturing
both of you naked.
 Yeah, I like that.
I like to think about you
naked too, Sturtz.
What the fuck!
Lee might have
sprung you for now,
but we're not gonna
let you out of our sight.
Hey, Meatbag,
leave my client alone.
Trying to make my life
as hard as possible?
Lee, I know who
the new witness is.
This waitress from the diner.
But she's lying about--
- I have to keep a leash on you?
- And Terry drove away
from the diner with Merrin
that night. They drove
off together in his car.
You're saying Terry was the
last person to see her alive?
Yeah. I don' thing he'd
do anything to her, but he
can't remember anything--
So why is he confessing
to you all of a sudden?
- Because of the horns, Lee!
- Oh, my God. Ig,
I can't talk to you when you're
like this. There's no horns.
You're going crazy.
Go home.
Why are you wearing
Merrin's cross?
It's not Merrin's.
It's mine.
You think I'm an idiot?
You think I don't know what
Merrin's cross looks like?
 Yes, it's hers.
She gave it to me.
 Why would she do that?
- Ig--
- What?
There's things about
Merrin you don't know.
There's things
about Merrin and me
that I haven't
told you.
 What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, it wasn't
anything we meant to happen.
You're saying
you were the one she--
- Ig, come on.
- You're the reason
she wanted to leave me.
- We didn't want to hurt you.
- If you didn't want to hurt me,
you did a fucking lousy job!
- Ig, come on.
Ig. Ig,
I'm sorry.
 Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
- You like that new girl
in church?
- I don't know her yet.
Ig, you like her enough
to get me to fix her cross.
I liker her too.
She seems,
you know, cute.
 Ha! Ha! Ha!
Get the hell
off my property.
I know I'm the last person
you want to see right now,
but you're the only person
I can ask about this.
I got nothing
to say to you.
I should shoot you
right in the heart.
 No.
If you really
wanted to kill me,
you've already
have done it.
I know that.
These days, I bring out
the worst in people.
What I want is for you
to tell me the truth
about what you did
to my daughter.
And then I want to kill you.
- What I need to know is,
did Merrin say anything
to you about leaving me,
or about being
with somebody else?
You got some
kind of nerve,
coming out here and
asking me if my daughter
was unfaithful
to you?
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?
You're the only person she
would've told, you're the only
one who loved her like I did.
Don't you fucking
dare say we're the same!
When I was watching the cancer
devour my wife's insides,
the only saving grace was I
thought that was the worst thing
that'd ever happen to me.
But boy, was I wrong!
- Dale, believe me,
you have to believe me,
I loved her.
But now I don't know if I ever
really even knew who she was.
You think there's a chance
in hell I'm gonna say
one word to you
about my daughter?
If you're looking for
forgiveness or compassion,
or understanding, go talk
to a goddamn priest!
I know you
killed her.
And I hope you die.
I hope you die
scared and helpless
in the dirt,
just like
my Merrin did.
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.
I souldn't
have come.
Get off my porch or
I swear I will shoot you.
- Fuck this!
Fuck.
Sometimes God works
 in mysterious ways.
The horns that reveal
 so much already,
now I can use them to findnher killer and set things right.
See, that even doesn't pay
and it's gonna be a long time
for you to even try
and look pretty again.
You guys really want to stop
following me around.
You're telling us
what to do now?
 Oh.
I mean, wouldn't
you rather
just suck each other
off right here?
What the hell
makes you say that?
You know, ever since we were
kids, I kind of assumed
you maybe had to act
so tough because you were
ashamed of yourself.
Was I right?
When I was a kid, I used to
shoplift gay porno magazines
from the drug store. When my dad
found them under my bed,
he cracked me with his belt.
- You've both been brought up
to believe it's a sin,
but it's just being human.
That's why I always wanted
to be partnered with Eric.
I think about him all the time
when I'm whacking off.
I want to kiss you on the
mouth when you talk
dirty like that.
Have fun,
officers.
- Oh, Wallace!
- Come here.
 Hey, Terry.
 Ig.
I didn't know you were
gonna come by.
- How's it going?
 What's that snake
doing around your neck?
- I made a new friend.
 You want a drink?
Or maybe something
a little stronger?
 No.
No, I want to keep
my head clear tonight.
But don't let me stop you.
Do as much as you want to do.
Jesus Christ,
Terry, how many drugs
have you been doing lately?
If you want to know
the truth, I've...
I've had a hard time
staying sober,
you know, ever
since Merrin died.
I've actually been
on kind of a bender myself
tonight.
I've been having
a very good time.
 That's, uh...
That's great, I'm glad
to hear that, Ig.
Shit. Look...
I know things have been
tough for you lately,
OK, but...
Well, understandably,
but I just...
But here's where
the fun ends.
This is gonna give me
no pleasure at all.
What are you
talking about?
 Well...
You're my big brother,
Terry.
I've always depended on you
to look out for me.
I've always tried to do my
best by you, Ig, you know that.
 Except when you saw Merrin
lying under that tree
in that dirt. You didn't
call an ambulance
and you didn't
call the cops.
You just ran off
and left her there.
Fuck, Ig, she was
already dead, OK?
There was nothing I could do,
the cops would've thought
that I killed her.
Even when I got arrested, you
didn't go to them and tell them
the truth, no.
Now, why would you?
Why would you do that
unless you were guilty?
Unless you actually
killed her?
Because I'm your fucking
brother, that's why!
You understand, if I... I mean,
they would've just thought
I was helping you.
- But you didn't even
try to help me!
All you wanted
to do was save
your own skin. You are
a selfish motherfucker,
Terry, and I hate you.
 You know what?
You're so
fucking right.
You're right, I'm evil
and you should kill me, Iggy.
That's what you should do,
you should fucking kill me.
That's what I deserve,
right? I mean, after what I did,
that's what I fucking deserve.
The way I see it, I have
every right to kill you.
But I'm gonna let you live
and make you suffer.
Why don't you just finish
all that off?
 What, all of it?
I think I made
myself clear.
Now there's
nowhere left to run.
You're going to see
everything she saw
and feel what she felt.
And the worst part is,
you're going to live
through all of it.
 Ig... Iggy!
Fuck! Iggy!
Iggy!
 Terry.
 No, no!
 Terry! Terry! Terry!
No! Iggy!
Where are you?
No! Help me!
Stop...
Stop!
- Punishing Terry was the
 hardest thing I've ever done.
But forcing him
 to face his demon
was the only way
 I could help him.
 Jesus Christ, Ig,
I've been looking
for you everywhere.
Get out of here before
I do something we're
both going to regret.
You've got to take care
of yourself. That's what
Merrin would've wanted.
So you're the expert
on what Merrin wanted now.
I was never going
to tell you anything.
 No.
So how long was it going
on between you two?
- You don't want to
know any of that.
- I need to understand.
 Just a couple months.
She's moving out
to California.
We wanted to figure out if
it was real before we told you.
So when she got killed,
did you think it was me?
Like did you think that I found
out about you and lost control?
- If I thought that,
I wouldn't help you.
- I don't want your help.
I'm gonna prove that waitress
was lying and I'm gonna get
Terry to confess to the police.
Fucking go, Lee,
leave me alone and
don't fucking touch me!
Give me your cross!
- Ah, fuck!
Are those horns?
 Damn right they're horns.
I'm glad you can
finally see them.
Now you've got
to tell me the truth.
Merrin's cross can't
protect you any more.
Why should I
tell you anything?
Because you're not going
to be able to help it.
I never meant
to kill her.
I didn't mean
to do it.
I loved her
just as much as you.
I'm the one
who fixed her cross.
She should've
been with me.
You sure as shit fooled me.
I always thought
you spent your whole life
trying to be good!
- Trying to control myself.
- But you saved my life
when we were kids.
You pulled me out of the water
right here! You're the only
reason I'm alive!
This is the stupidest
mistake I ever made.
I sould've let you drown
and I'd be with her now.
- That's a fucking lie!
Thank you for coming
to see me.
Listen,
I think Ig is going
to propose to me.
Do you know anything
about that?
- Maybe.
- There are some things
that I've learned
about myself recently
and I...
I know now that I can
never marry Ig.
Why are you
telling me this?
Can you come
by the diner later?
I really think i twill help
if you're there when this
is all over with.
 Sure.
 Thank you.
Terry?
- It's me.
- Oh, Lee,
you frightened me.
- What are you doing our here?
Get some dry clothes on you.
I'll drive you home, come on.
- No, no.
I want to be alone right now.
- You're gonna be sick.
 No.
You OK?
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey,
it's all right.
Everything's okay.
I got you,
I got you.
What... what
are you doing?
There's nobody
here except us.
 Are you joking?
I mean, you don't have
to pretend any more.
It's just...
It's fine.
- No, no!
- Come on.
Stop it!
Don't do that!
Get off me!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I just...
I've been waiting for this
for such a long time.
I can't believe
this is finally happening.
I need to touch you.
- No.
 You're real.
No! Listen, you're
his best friend.
You're my friend.
You're my friend.
Don't you understand
anything?
I understand
everything.
I understand
everything.
Everytime the three
of us hang out together
it's like there's this
elephant in the room.
Because we are so clearly
supposed to be together,
but nobody
says anything.
You know?
And... and
And we stare
at each other,
Merrin. We stare
at each other.
No, let go of me!
Don't!
You don't know the first
thing about what I'm
going through right now.
What the fuck
are you talking about?
What about all the signals
you've been sending me?
What? Signals?
What,.,.
 Merrin.
My God, you thought that
I broke up with Ig so that...
No, no!
I know
you love me.
I love you,
I love you.
I love Ig so much!
I love him
more than the world!
That's the last
thing she said?
That she loved me?
You want to know
what happened, Ig? Shut up!
 Help me, no!
Stop it! Help!
Daddy!
I gave her
what she asked for.
 Oh! Jes...
 Please! Please,
it's me, it's me!
I fucked her
tight little pussy.
 No, no!
- I bashed her face
with a rock.
- No!
You know what?
Love made devils of us both.
The way I see it,
you confessed to me,
and were so overwhelmed
with guilt
that you killed yourself.
So... I've always
wanted to try this.
It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun.
OK.
 Mr. Perrish committed suicide
earlier today.
We've recovered his vehicle.
 Perrish's lawyer Lee Tourneau
was the only witness
of the scene.
Mr. Perrish confessed
 his crimes to Mr Tourneau
and then killed himself.
- We've got a report from the
police that no body was found.
- All reports originating
 outside the police department
should be considered
 pure conjecture at this time,
nothing more.
 - One more question.
- Breaking news this evening
from the police force
 in Merrin William's case.
It occured tonight
that Ig Perrish has...
Well, one thing
I'll say in my favor,
I'm really fucking
hard to kill.
Why the hell
aren't you dead?
The truth is I don't know the
answer to that question myself.
I have prayed for
so long for you to die.
But when I saw
the news on the TV,
it didn't help one bit.
 I didn't kill her,
Mr Williams.
But you know
who did it,
don't you?
You got
to tell me.
- What will you
do if I tell you?
- You know what I'll do.
 But this is my job.
People say you should always
do the right thing.
But sometimes
there is no right thing.
And then,
then you just have to pick
the sin you can live with.
Why don't
you come inside?
Yesterday, I was wondering
around the house
and I found this.
I thought maybe I should
give it to the police, but...
that didn't feel right.
She wanted you to have this.
 Thank you.
There's something
I would like
to give you.
Here.
Merrin's mother gave this
to her just before she...
You know, son,
I think...
I think you need this
even more than I do.
I think you need her
to keep you safe.
Well now,
I guess
maybe that's some kind
of blessing after all.
- The horns weren't a curse,
 but a blessing.
They guided me this far.
And when I put on her cross,
I could feel her
 protecting me again.
"Dear Ig,
"you'll never read this
while I'm alive.
"I'm not even sure I want
you to read it after I'm dead.
"I think you're gonna
ask me to marry you soon
"and you don't know
how much I want to say yes.
"But I can't.
"The thing is, Ig,
I'm very sick.
"The sort of cancer I have, it's
the kind that runs in families.
"I saw my mother go through it.
"And I saw what
it did to my father.
"If I tell you I'm sick, you'll
want to marry me even more,
"and I'll be weak and say yes.
"And you'll give up your future
"and be shackled to me
as I go through hell
"and die anyway.
"I won't put you through that.
"I love you too much.
"I promise to hurt
you just enough
"to push you away.
"And hopefully, one day,
you can forgert me
"and then move on
to someone else.
"You'll have children,
grandchildren
"and great-grandchildren.
"You'll go for long walks
in the woods.
"On one of these walks,
"when you're very old,
"you'll find yourself
at a tree,
"a house in its branches.
"I'll be waiting
for you there.
"I'll be waiting by candlelight
in our tree house,
"shining the light
of my cross into your eyes,
"the first message
I ever sent you.
"Us.
"I love you, Iggy Perrish.
Your girl, Merrin."
 Ig.
You're alive.
- No, don't.
 Ig,
we have to clear
your name.
We need to figure out
who really killed Merrin.
 It was Lee.
If you are going
after Lee,
then I am coming
with you.
You're not strong
enough for that.
I'm not
leaving you.
I made myself
a promise:
ever again.
If anything happens to me,
I need to know you're all right.
For Mom and Dad's sake.
 I'll be damned.
 You and me both.
What are you
doing out here?
You don't remember
anything that happened
between us, do you?
You want to
come inside?
No, actually I was hoping
we could go for a walk.
Nobody's
looking for me.
Pretty much verybody in town
everybody thinks I'm dead.
- No shit.
- What do you say?
- Just a walk?
- Yeah.
Why do you
bring us here?
 You know why.
This is where
you killed Merrin.
What happened
to you?
You lost
your mind?
Things are going
to go a lot easier
for both of us
if you don't lie to me.
 Ig...
I'm your best friend, you've
told me your whole life.
You think I have something
to do with this?
 Believe me,
all I want to do
is kill you.
But I'm trying
to be human.
I'm trying to be the kind
of man Merrin wanted me to be.
So I'm giving you
this chance to do
the right thing.
We are going to go down
to the police station.
You're going to
turn yourself in.
- Keep your hands
where I can see them, Lee.
Don't do anything stupid.
- Terry.
- What the fuck are
you doing here, Terry?
Terry came to talk
to me just now.
He told me some things
about the night Merrin died.
Anything he said, he was just
trying to save his own ass.
- Go fuck yourself.
- Yeah, fuck you too.
You told everybody
that he confessed to you,
and then killed
himself.
At least one of those
things isn't true.
So now I'm wondering, what else
you were lying to me about?
 Fuck.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
 Lee.
I didn't mean
to hurt her.
It was a mistake,
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I want to do
the right thing.
OK, I'm gonna fix
all of this.
- You're doing good.
- OK.
OK.
- That's right.
We've been friends
a long time.
Fuck, Lee, put
the goddamn gun down.
 Ha! Ha! Ha!
Get the fuck up.
Get the fuck up!
OK.
OK, OK.
Wouh!
 I'm so sorry, Merrin.
I'll see you soon.
Aaahhh!
 No!
 Please, Ig.
 Iggy.
- In the end,
 I embraced the horns.
Like an angel
 who fell to earth,
I became a devil
one last time.
The revenge
 is all consuming,
and my time has come
 to return to you,
so we can be
together again.
I mean, if this
isn't paradise,
I don't know what is.
 Are you horny?
 Mm, I'm getting warmer.
 Oh! Right.
No.
- Yes.
 No!
I'm going to love you
for the rest of my life.
Just love me
for the rest of mine.
