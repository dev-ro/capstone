TWO LOTTERY TICKETS
Calm down, please.
Let me speak.
It's going to be OK.
I only need a thousand Euros.
I'll get it from Chelu this week.
I don't have any cash
to send you now.
Try to borrow some from Mariana.
Is she working illegally too?
I'll find a way to send you some.
Then you can leave Giuliano.
Fuck that asshole!
I'll break his legs if I catch him.
You'd better quit.
He doesn't pay and he's a liar too.
Tell him that if I catch him,
I'll break his legs.
All right. OK, bye.
I love you.
Hello?
Buddy, come over here.
- What are these marks?
- Sorry?
These marks right here.
Isn't this paint?
What have I paid for?
This is as good
as ifs ever going to get.
I could've fixed it myself
with a spray can.
I told you,
it needs to be replaced.
But you wanted the cheap way.
It can't get any better.
- I'm not paying for this.
- Say what?
Am I supposed to flush money away?
Now I'll have to go elsewhere
and pay that guy as well.
Do whatever you want,
but you have to pay me.
At least pay for the materials.
Just take a look at this!
Can I go out like that?
Do you want people to laugh at me?
- So?
- I only want to cover my costs.
I'm not giving you a dime!
You takin' me for a fool?
Don't leave like this...
Pay for the materials at least.
Please.
Take this, you pathetic wretch.
Go to hell, lowlife.
Wretch!
Cheers!
How are you, man?
Hi.
- What happened?
- Well...
I placed a bet
and they scored at the last minute.
I don't know what happened today,
nothing worked out. Not a thing!
Last Thursday I won 210 lei
and I've lost 140 just today.
If you don't slow down...
- Hey, Ion!
- What's up with you, drinking so early?
- What's wrong?
- I'm penniless, that's what's wrong.
Who isn't?
I told Gina I'd send her 1,200 €
this week.
- That guy treats her like a slave!
- How much do you have?
With the money from Chelu, 280.
But I need to finish the house as well.
- So, how much do you need?
- About 20,000.
- Piece of cake for you.
- Damn it...
According to my plan,
I should've had 12,000 by now.
I'll find away.
That's rough, Dinel...
- Maybe I can sell something.
- Sell what? Your underwear?
Let's place some bets!
The match is about to start
and the stakes are 18:1
for Botezatu scoring
in the second half.
If you bet 10 lei, you win 180.
If you bet 100, how much, Pompiliu?
.See?
- I'm not betting my money away.
- Listen, sucker.
The last 3 times,
he only scored in the second half.
- They have a bad defense. Sure win!
- I don't know football.
I used to watch our team
in the 3rd division. But they flopped.
- What if I'm telling you it's a sure bet?
- Why don't you bet, then?
I've had bad luck today.
Here's what we'll do.
I'll pay for you.
Stop it!
10 lei, for Botezatu scoring
in the second half.
- If I win, cut down my tab.
- Sure...
Watch here.
That's how you make money.
You're wasting your money.
- I've only spent 10 lei.
- 10 lei today, 40 lei yesterday...
Had you given me all the money you lost,
I'd have my house.
You'll thank me
when I give you 100 for nothing.
Put it in the bank,
for the interest.
Put money in the bank? Are you crazy?
Wanna give it to the Jews?
Better set it on fire!
And gambling it away is better?
Do you think he knows he's about to...
when he scores? It's all so random.
All matches are rigged so that suckers
like you bet their money.
- The managers and club owners get it.
- Whatever.
How come teams that small
have won the championship?
Betting mafia! That's why! Do you know
what the first ever fixed match was?
The one between the Romans
and the Jews. When they caught Jesus.
No! No! You moron!
- What happened?
- The moron got a red card!
You think it happened by chance?
I think I'll sell my dad's Dacia.
You won't even get 200 € for it.
Does it still work?
Sure it does.
Well, it needs to be fixed. And painted.
We can bet on the Tour de France.
Why don't you sell it
for spare parts?
Wow! 6 million, the lottery prize!
- How about it? Let's play the lottery!
- Get out of here!
- How much?
-6 million.
It's Gina!
Hello? Yes, love!
Fine. How about you?
Yes.
What?
Who? Him'?
And what did you say?
Are you crazy?
Gina, are you mental?
Why would you move in with him
after the way he treated you?
I told you I'd send the money
in two days!
Please be patient,
I'll send you the money!
I can't believe it.
What are you doing to me?
Is he there?
Let me talk to him.
Put him on, please.
Thank you.
Hello?
Buona sera, don Giuliano.
Lo sono Dinel,
il... marito di Gina.
I don”: know what you're up to, but
if you touch her, I'll break your legs.
Comprende? Understand?
Yeah, that's right!
I'll break your legs.
Understand? Capisci?
I'll turn you to dust!
You damn mascarpone...
I'll break your legs...
Gina? I'm asking you, please,
tell him that if he touches you,
I'll sweep the floor with him.
I'm not afraid of the mafia!
Did you hear me?
Hello? Gina?
Fucking bastard!
Put it on my tab, all right?
So you were saying...
What are the lottery rules?
How do you want to play?
Basic, combined, reduced,
combined reduced variant?
So, the basic version.
You have to guess
Gout of 49 numbers.
What's so hard about that?
In school I got it right
without doing the math!
It's not that easy
to get all of them right.
No one's guessed them in half a year,
that's why the prize is so large.
Better not waste my money, then.
I'm broke enough as it is.
- Ion...
- Don't be a sucker!
Mugurel played the lottery
and he only guessed 5 numbers.
He bought a flat, a satellite TV
with CD-player, a new German car...
- No CD-player.
- He does have a satellite dish.
- Wait, didn't he have a Dacia Sport?
- He's got a Golf 4 from Germany.
- What a shame! That was a good car.
- Look.
You choose the numbers, I'll pay.
If you win, we'll split fifty-fifty.
- You pay for it.
- Didn't I just say so?
Give me a lottery ticket.
- Can you spare 2 Lei?
- Who, me?
I gave you money last week.
Have you forgotten? I haven't!
Last week I took your advice
and bet 80 lei on Chelsea - PSG.
So, what about it?
And who paid for beer last night?
Fine...
Here's 2 Lei.
I'll start writing it down.
- Goddamn Scrooge!
- Goddamn thief!
Be careful, the lottery is a scam.
You think they don't know the numbers?
How come they only win
on Easter or Christmas?
- Should I pick random numbers?
- Yes. No! Not random ones.
Some people put in their shoe size
or their wife's age.
Anything you like.
OK, my age"-
Gina's...
Our house number...
What's my shoe size? 43...
So 40, 39, 41, 43 and 42.
That makes five. I need one more.
Did you pick them in sequence?
39, 40, 41, 42 and 43?
Pick 44 then,
that would be next.
If you pick these, you don't stand
a chance! They'll never come out.
- So what do I do?
- Pick some others.
Which ones?
- What's your birth year? '75, right?
- Yes.
So you have 1, 9, 7 and 5.
- How much is that, Pompiliu?
- Pick 22!
- 22, then...
You'll be sorry
if his first numbers come out.
If they do,
I'll cut down my own hand.
This is it! In a few days,
it's going to look as good as new.
You won't even sell it
for spare parts.
You're an ignoramus.
This car is older than me.
It's vintage.
Vintage, my ass!
It belongs in the scrap yard.
- Who'd collect such a rust bucket?
- It's from the first batch.
It has French parts.
Easy!
The screw bolts
might've been Romanian though.
Don't you worry, I'll fix it.
Then you'll beg me for a ride
through town!
- Well, get it started and let's go!
- I don't think it'll start.
Shouldn't this door open, though?
- Suck my...
- What was that?
Sorry, I wasn't talking to you.
- I asked what you said!
- He asked what you said!
Nothing.
I was just talking to myself.
You said nothing, but you were talking
to yourself? How's that?
- Well?
- What did I do? What did I say?
- That's exactly what we asked you!
- Well, I didn't say anything.
Really, dork-face?
- Can't you see what you look like?
- What do I look like?
Apologize, man!
I apologize,
but I don'! know what for.
- Apologize, don't give me this crap!
- I apologize.
Look at you, all scared like that.
Did you like it?
The idiot sure got scared.
What have you got there?
Nothing. Some keys, a lighter...
How about you give me...
this bumbag?
Sure, take it...
But can I have the keys
and the lighter back?
What the fuck would I do
with your keys?
- But the lighters cool, I'll keep it.
- Keep it.
Cheers, man. Bless you.
Good luck!
Such an idiot!
Well done, Dinel!
Good as gold.
Awesome!
Well done!
- It took a while, but it was worth it.
- Very nice, my boy.
- Did you have it registered?
- Whatever for?
If you change the colour,
you need to register the car again.
- What colour is it on the registration?
- I don't know. White.
Let me see the papers.
White.
You have to get a new certificate.
- I will.
- No rush, whenever you feel like it.
Hey, Sile.
Take it easy. It's...
Cheers, Dinel!
Congratulations!
I was telling you about this guy,
Nikola Tesla.
He was Romanian and his name
was Nicu Teslea. How about that?
He was from Banat and his dad was
an Orthodox priest, did you know?
So the greatest inventor that ever lived
was 100% Romanian.
His grandfather's name was Draghici.
How about that?
But the Americans claimed him
and all smart Eastern Europeans...
Guys! Hey, guys!
We've won!
What?
- All six numbers came out.
- What?
We won!
Oh my God, you guys!
Check out the winning numbers!
9, 16, 22, 26, 33 and 41.
Those are Dinel's numbers,
I wrote them down!
- We won!
- Is that today's paper'?
Yeah, it is!
Look what it says over here:
"The Lottery Board has announced
that there is a winning ticket.
According to the computer,
it contains all the numbers drawn.
The grand prize
hasn't been claimed yet!"
- That's us, Dinel!
- Oh my God, Sile!
- Drinks for everyone! On me!
- Well done, man! Bravo!
What are we going to do
with all that money?
- What do you mean?
- How are we going to spend 6 million €?
"We"? You mean Dinel and I.
Why would you be in on it? Cheers, Dinel!
Didn't I pitch in
when you bought the ticket?
- How much did you pay, man?
- I lent you 2 Lei, didn't I?
- Yeah, he did.
- Didn't I pay 2 Lei for the ticket?
- So? Does that make it your ticket, too?
- Come on, Sile.
Weren't you saying
that the lottery was a scam?
That the Jews and the Masons
were pulling the strings?
But he paid 2 Lei,
so part of the ticket is his.
- Is this the kind of friend you are?
- Hey!
Here's 2 Lei back... Here's 1 Leu.
Give me 1 Leu.
Here's 5 Lei and keep your conspiracy
theories. Cheers, Dinel!
- That's what friendship means to you?
- Give me a break, man.
You'd never have bought that ticket
if it hadn't been for me.
- You tryin' to double cross me?
- Enough, you guys!
There's enough money for everyone.
It's 6 million. So quit it.
There's 3 of us, 6 divided by 3,
that's... how much?
Two million each.
What the hell?
All for one and one for all,
wasn't that our motto?
Sile...
- All right, we'll split it three ways.
- Yeah!
- Let's go downtown!
- Let's go!
Let's go cash the prize!
- Give me the ticket!
- What ticket?
- Don't tell me you threw it away!
- I haven't thrown it away.
Dinel, give me the ticket!
- I think I've lost it...
- How could you possibly lose it?
When they stole my bumbag,
the ticket was in it.
- Who stole your bumbag?
- I don't know...
There were 2 guys
inside my building.
It can't be a simple coincidence!
Let's go to the police!
They had a white car
with Bucharest plates.
- What make was it?
- I don't know! I can't remember...
- I thought you were a mechanic.
- Yes, but I was scared!
Wait a minute,
this can't be a coincidence.
Two guys in a white car bullied
someone who had just won the lottery.
Mind you, a white car from Bucharest.
It's the Secret Services!
- What Secret Services?
- All of them.
- They keep an eye on everything.
- Do you think they're still after us?
Of course!
Think they're amateurs?
What are you staring at? Ion...
Who changed the president?
Who started the Revolution?
Let's go to the police!
Dinel...
We've been hunted down!
Write down who, when, where,
what they looked like,
any peculiarities...
I don't know who...
There were two men.
- Do I write that?
- Yes. Describe them.
How they were dressed,
what specific marks...
I mean if any of them had a mark
on his face, a mole or a scar.
- They had no scars.
- Then don'! write anything.
Their car had Bucharest plates.
It was white.
- Should I write that?
- Yes. Write everything.
When did it happen...
Four days ago.
Four days ago?
Why haven't you reported it sooner?
- I've just...
- He was out of town...
- I've just realised...
- Because he was out of town.
And what did you keep in the bumbag?
Documents, money?
Ah, no, no. I had a ticket...
A love note!
Yes, a love note.
It had no financial value,
but it held great sentimental value.
For him.
Besides that, he had about 2-300 Lei,
an icon and the keys...
They gave the keys back.
- So they returned the keys...
- Yes.
So you had an icon, a love note
and 200 Lei.
300 Lei.
- And how much was the bumbag worth?
- I don't know.
- I got it for free. Promotional item.
- I understand.
Write down
"damages valued at 300 lei".
- Anything else?
- That's it.
Write down the date,
sign your name, and bring it to me.
And do you think you can find them?
Yes, of course.
After you finish your report,
we'll immediately send a forensic team
to inspect the place,
then we'll close the borders
and contact the Interpol.
That's the best we can do.
How long will it take to find them?
If the FBI join the hunt,
we might catch them in four hours!
Really?
Did you hear that?
Why didn't you tell them
about the lottery ticket?
If they learned that we lost a 6 million €
ticket, would we ever find it?
And now that they don't know,
we're sure to find it?
Stop arguing!
We must keep calm and rational.
They'll find the thieves
in a few hours.
Dinel, she was mocking you.
They'll never find them!
Think so?
Then why did she say that?
Pompiliu, if you have a plan,
tell us now.
Otherwise we'll go back and tell them
about the ticket!
Do you trust the Romanian police?
I don't.
As a State employee, I can swear
that nobody will do anything for us.
- We need to help ourselves.
- How do you suggest we do that?
You met the thieves
in the hallway, right?
Right.
Meaning they were visiting someone
in that building. Right?
We'll go from door to door
and find out who the thieves were.
And do you really think
we'll find them?
Listen here, Dinel!
If Decebalus, during the first
Dacian-Roman war, 101-102 A.D.,
had had any doubts
about defeating Trajan,
with the Roman army being, mind you,
ten times larger than ours,
do you think the Romans would have
carved him on Trajan's Column?
Didn't Decebalus die?
Of course he did.
We all die eventually, but...
We still have 3 days
to claim our prize.
My point exactly!
Let's get on with it.
- With what?
- Let's go! Come on, focus!
Hello there!
We have a question.
- Are you from the cable company?
- No, we're not.
The TV channels have been a mess
since three days ago.
I called the company,
but they said it wasn't their fault.
Oh, my! Have you noticed two men
in the building these days?
- A taller one and a...
- You think they caused the TV issues?
We don't know,
but we'll find out.
Have you had two visitors
from Bucharest lately?
What? No, I haven't had any visitors.
All right then.
Thank you very much.
- Costel!
- Yes.
Have you had two visitors over
from Bucharest?
- What?
- Two visitors from Bucharest!
'Course not!
Are they from the cable company?
- No, they're not.
- Thank you very much. Good day!
Let's check this one.
- Who lives here?
- Cornel.
Who's there?
Who the hell is Cornel?
Hi. Are your parents home, dear?
No, my parents aren't home!
Do you know if they had any visitors
from Bucharest lately?
I don't. And they told me
never to open the door to strangers.
That's good advice. At least tell me
when your parents will be home.
They come back from work
at 4 o'clock.
'Til then I'm not allowed
to open the door to anyone.
Yes, very well...
That kid knows more
than she's willing to tell us...
How do you figure?
I can feel it. I can read people.
There's something fishy about her.
Hello. We're trying to find two men
who've been in this building.
- Are you the police?
- No, we're not the police.
Good afternoon. We're looking for
two men who were here the other day,
one of them was tall and thin,
and the other was shorter.
- Are you the police?
- No, sir, we're not the police.
Good afternoon.
Come in.
They're all right.
Have a seat.
- Can I smoke in here?
- Yes.
How much?
How much what?
Well, how much do you want?
How much of what?
What are you looking for?
We're looking for two men
who stole a bumbag in this building.
- Are you the police?
- No, man, we're not!
Here come the fuzz
So? I don't get it.
You're not looking for us?
No! We're looking for two men
from Bucharest.
Their car had Bucharest plates.
These men stole
your neighbour's bumbag
and he had
some very valuable things in it.
- Really?
- Yes.
It happened in the hallway,
a few days ago.
Those bastards!
And what did you have in it?
Something personal...
but extremely valuable to me.
Did you see anyone?
Yes... I think...
I think I remember something!
- Really?
- Yeah!
I've seen you
in the building before.
Not me... Two men.
A tall one and a short one.
Yeah...
I can't remember, sorry.
Not here, for sure.
Strangers rarely come here.
Hence, the earlier misunderstanding.
- We'd like to help you, but...
- But you can't.
Sorry for bothering you.
Since you're here,
you might as well smoke a joint with us.
- A what?
- We need to go.
But what is it? Drugs?
I haven'! seen drugs before.
- Let's go, Dinel!
- Do you want some?
Oh, no. I'm a God-fearing man
and I don'! want to sin.
But it's not a sin.
Well, I have vices of my own.
I drink occasionally,
just like the next man,
but I don't want to succumb to temptation
and start doing drugs...
A truly upstanding citizen!
I'll have a bite of that cake though.
I haven'! eaten since breakfast
and they look so good.
- Sure, go ahead.
- Really? Thanks.
- Did you bake these yourself?
- Yes.
You'll make someone a fine wife.
- Do you like it?
- Mmm... Tasty!
- What did you put in it? Basil?
- No.
- Dinel, we're leaving!
- It's good.
Do drop by sometime!
- Bye!
- See you.
- Yes.
- Good day.
We're looking for two men who were
in this building about 4 or 5 days ago.
A tall one and a short one.
One spoke with a Moldavian accent
and they had a car from Bucharest.
Any idea who they are
or where we can find them?
- Sure!
- Really?
Come in!
- Hello.
- So what do you want to know?
We're looking for two men who were
in this building and stole a bumbag.
And you said you knew who they were,
where we could find them.
Of course I do.
I'm a clairvoyant, I know everything.
- Could you tell us how to find them?
- Naturally.
- Well, how?
- It's not that easy.
- Why not?
- You have to pay.
He's got that right.
- How much?
- 100 Lei.
- Well...
- I'm not wasting money on this.
- We've got nothing to lose.
- Really?
It's an investment. We spend
a hundred, we'll get millions.
Come on, show me the money! Here.
Fine, take every dime I have.
A complete waste of cash!
Argentina! Come here!
Take these boys' money.
Let's see now...
Sit down.
- So you're looking for two men, right?
- Right.
Two men who were in the building
a few days ago.
One was taller and one shorter,
but he looked more menacing.
Yes, I see them.
They're not from around here.
Well, yes, they had
Bucharest number plates.
- And they took something from you.
- Yes! A bumbag!
- With something valuable in it.
- Exactly!
- With something valuable in it.
- Exactly!
- Do you know where the bumbag is?
- They have it. The fall one has it.
- The tall one?
- Yes.
But the short one took it.
They may have swapped...
- Yes. They did, look over here.
- Yeah...
- Yes. They did, look over here.
- Yeah...
See?
And can you tell us
where to find them?
I don't know where,
but they're in a car.
- A white one?
- Yes, a white car.
- A white one?
- Yes, a white car.
And how can we find them?
- They'll find you.
- When?
Sooner than you think.
That's it, I see nothing more.
I understand.
I understand.
- Thank you.
- Let's go!
Can you tell me about Gina, my wife?
- If she's fine, if...
- Is she dead?
Oh, no! God forbid!
Oh, no! God forbid!
She went to Italy,
and we had an argument...
That will be 60 Lei.
Argentina!
- Yes?
- Read the boy's palm.
Give me your hand.
I see your wife on a sea shore.
Why is she at the seaside?
- She's not alone.
- Who is she with?
- A man.
- With Giuliano?
Giuliano, her boss?
Giuliano, her boss?
I don't know if he's her boss,
but he's rich.
It must be him!
She didn't mention going to the seaside.
- What are they doing there?
- They live there.
Can you tell me if...
Can you tell me if...
You know...
if they're together.
Yes, but she loves you.
She's waiting for you to rescue her.
- Rescue her'?
- Yes.
That means I have to find the money
and bring her back.
That means I have to find the money
and bring her back.
Exactly.
But hurry, time is running out.
So we need to find that bumbag.
If you wish, we could put a curse
on that Italian guy.
- Really?
- Yes.
- But it will cost you more.
- Well, next time then.
- But it will cost you more.
- Well, next time then.
Here's our full price list.
We do witchcraft, spells, curses,
we provide mourners for funerals...
All right, thank you.
All right, thank you.
I have a question.
There's a match tomorrow.
Liverpool vs. Manchester.
Could you tell me the final score?
Sorry, but I can't provide
such information.
But who will score the first goal?
Just the first letter of his name.
Just the first letter of his name.
Sorry, I can't possibly...
Well, take it back, I have no use for it.
It's past 4 o'clock,
the girl's parents must be home.
It's past 4 o'clock,
the girl's parents must be home.
We've wasted our time and money
on those gypsy crooks.
Look what the communists
did to our country...
If only we had won the war...
Hello, dear.
- Are your parents home yet?
- Not yet.
- Are your parents home yet?
- Not yet.
Do you know
when they might show up?
I shouldn't open the door
to anybody.
Do you mind if we wait for them
inside?
- We haven't checked all the floors yet.
- She knows something.
We'll wait for your parents inside, OK?
We'll wait for your parents inside, OK?
Come in!
Do you know if two men around 35
happened to come by,
Do you know if two men around 35
happened to come by,
one of them tall and thin
and the other one...
Short?
Right. How did you know that?
Right. How did you know that?
What do your parents do?
My mother's a secretary
and my father owns a small shop.
And do people come to visit?
Yes, they do.
Friends, relatives...
Yes, they do.
Friends, relatives...
- Do you have any relatives in Bucharest?
- We do.
Have any of those relatives come
to see your parents lately?
- You won't tell?
- I don't know.
Look at me.
Look at me.
- Look at me and tell the truth!
- I honestly don't know.
Why are you lying to me?
- What's going on?
- Good day, ma'am.
We're looking
for two dangerous fellows
who stole something valuable
from this building.
Who stole something valuable
from this building.
- Really? In our building?
- Yes. About 4-5 days ago.
You know Mr. Dinel, your neighbour,
and that is our colleague, Mr. Sile.
- And you are...
- Pompiliu Bor, from City Hall.
- And you are...
- Pompiliu Bor, from City Hall.
Brindua Dorohoi, nice to meet you.
But how can we help?
We believe that your daughter
has some very valuable information.
What could she know?
We're trying to find out.
Ask her to come back.
We're trying to find out.
Ask her to come back.
- Mihaela?
- Yes, her.
We'd like to talk to her.
- What's going on?
- They're here on official business.
There was a hold-up
in our building a few days ago.
Which apartment?
Hi, Dinel.
Which apartment?
Hi, Dinel.
Actually, it was a robbery,
Dinel was robbed of valuable things.
From his bumbag.
- In our building?
- In the hallway.
- In our building?
- In the hallway.
- And they say Mihaela knows who did it.
- What? Mihaela!
Do you know
about any robbers in our building?
Did you see anything?
They say you know something.
Did you see anything?
They say you know something.
I don't!
If you lie to me,
I'll tan your hide!
What makes you think
she knows anything?
She described
one of the robbers to us.
She described
one of the robbers to us.
Yeah.
You heard what he said!
Don't just stand there!
If you know anything, speak up!
- Do I need to help you remember'?
- Cornel...
- Do I need to help you remember'?
- Cornel...
Say something, goddamn it!
If you know anything, tell them.
Don't embarrass us.
I'll make you remember,
just wait and see!
Let her be.
Go to your room!
I'll teach her
not to hide things from us!
I'll teach her
not to hide things from us!
- No, no! We have to leave.
- Have we become a laughing stock?
Maybe we rushed to conclusions.
We'll keep looking.
- We really have to leave now.
- We're very sorry, she's a good girl.
- We really have to leave now.
- We're very sorry, she's a good girl.
- I don't know what came over her.
- It's fine.
- Bye, neighbour.
- See you.
- We're sorry for this mess, she's not...
- That's OK, we'll come back.
- We're sorry for this mess, she's not...
- That's OK, we'll come back.
I slave away all day
and you make me a laughing stock!
Keep your mouth shut!
Shut up, woman!
Have we been to this one?
Have we been to this one?
I don't remember, I don't think so.
Come on!
Hello.
Hello.
If you want a foursome,
ifs double the price.
- No, we're looking for somebody...
- Yeah, looking for somebody.
Hello...
What do we have here?
Hello...
What do we have here?
- Who wants to go first?
- I do!
- Come on.
- Sile!
How about you guys?
- I'm a decent, moral person...
- I'm married.
- I'm a decent, moral person...
- I'm married.
I'm a God-fearing man,
I have a wife, I'm married...
Me too, I'm also God-fearing.
So what are you doing here?
Supporting your friend?
Oh, no.
We're looking for two men.
Oh, no.
We're looking for two men.
We haven't got any men.
Just women.
Oh, no. We are looking for two men
who stole my bumbag.
And there was something
very, very valuable inside it.
And I need to find that bumbag
so I can bring my wife home.
And I need to find that bumbag
so I can bring my wife home.
She's been in Italy
for the past two years.
She was only supposed to stay
a few months,
but she ended up working
for a gangster who won't let her leave.
But she ended up working
for a gangster who won't let her leave.
And I need to pay
an early termination penalty
if I want to bring her home
before her contract expires.
- How much?
- A lot.
But if I find the thieves who stole my
bumbag, I could get the money I need.
But if I find the thieves who stole my
bumbag, I could get the money I need.
What if I told you
I'll pay in a few days?
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- I'm not lying.
I'm gonna be a millionaire
in a few days, honest to God!
- Come then. I don't do it for free.
- You really don't believe me?
- Come then. I don't do it for free.
- You really don't believe me?
Why should I?
I'm telling you,
I won the lottery grand prize.
And I can't shag you
because I'm still a virgin.
Look! These are the winning numbers.
Look! These are the winning numbers.
All I have to do is retrieve the ticket
and cash my money.
- Afterwards, I'll take you to the seaside.
- Really?
Really! My cousin lives in Constantya,
Really! My cousin lives in Constantya,
in a two-bedroom flat.
The discos in Mamaia
are only 20 minutes away...
- Would you like to go there?
- I'd love to.
- I've never been to the seaside.
- Then I'll take you.
- I've never been to the seaside.
- Then I'll take you.
- Promise?
- I promise!
I'd like to believe you.
But there are so many jerks out there,
I don't know what to believe anymore.
But there are so many jerks out there,
I don't know what to believe anymore.
You'll see that I'm not lying.
If you're not a liar,
then have some patience.
- Come on...
- Patience!
You're something else.
And that's what's going to happen
if I don't get my bumbag.
And that's what's going to happen
if I don't get my bumbag.
I won't get the money I need
to bring my beloved wife back,
- ...we won't move into our own home...
- God, this is so sad!
- What happened?
- It's so sad...
But it's so romantic,
what he's doing for his wife...
That's why I'd be so grateful
if you could help us with any info
about the two men who were
in this building a few days ago.
About the two men who were
in this building a few days ago.
A tall guy with a Moldavian accent
and a shorter one, with Bucharest plates.
Moldavian?
I think we had a Moldavian
a few days ago...
Remember the Moldavian guy
and that roughneck?
Remember the Moldavian guy
and that roughneck?
. The pervert',
. Yes! -
- He only wanted kinky stuff.
- They must be the ones.
One with a Moldavian accent
and a blondish, more dangerous one.
Exactly. They came from Bucharest,
had some business in town.
Exactly. They came from Bucharest,
had some business in town.
And do you know
where we can find them?
No, sorry...
Did they leave behind any clues,
any objects... anything at all?
- I don't think so...
- They only left behind... a matchbox.
- I don't think so...
- They only left behind... a matchbox.
- What?
- There was a matchbox around here.
Where the hell is it?
This one?
This one?
- Yes, that's the one.
- "GP Hotel".
That's uptown. Let's go!
They might be staying there.
Come on!
I really hope you find them!
No need to knock,
we've tracked them down!
- Yes?
- Sorry, wrong door!
- Do you have your car keys?
- Sure.
- Take the car, we'll save time!
- It's not registered.
Don't be silly!
Everybody knows us in town.
- I don't want any trouble.
- What trouble, Dinel?
- Do you still want that ticket?
- I do.
Come on, then!
Where are you going?
- To get those guys!
- Do you know what room they're in?
- We need a plan.
- What if they leave?
- We'll see them.
- That's true.
- So what's the plan?
- We find out their room number.
- OK, how?
- We ask at the reception desk.
- How?
- We'll sweet-talk the receptionist.
Sile, you do it.
What if it's a guy?
Yeah, bad idea.
We have to make them come downstairs.
We'll ask the receptionist
to call them downstairs.
- I'll go.
- You go.
Wait a minute. Who do I ask for?
I don'! know their names.
We could say we're police officers.
Which one of us
looks like a bluecoat?
All right. I'll go.
What if he asks to see my badge?
Just go!
Stop overthinking this shit.
- I'll come and save your sorry ass.
- How?
I don't know, I'll find a way. Go!
Fine.
- Were they large guys?
- Why?
It'll just be us against them,
you know we can't rely on Pompiliu.
Wait a second.
Here you are.
Now we're talking...
- But I don't have one for Pompiliu.
- What for?
For Pompiliu.
He doesn't need one,
he'd only hurt himself.
Hello, young lady. I need some
information, do you have a moment?
Sure, how can I help?
I am looking for two men,
two suspects in a colossal robbery.
According to our sources,
they are checked in at this hotel.
These are the details we have.
Please pay close attention:
one is tall, thin
and has a Moldavian accent,
the other one is blond, short
and extremely dangerous.
They're gone.
- How so?
- They left.
If you find them,
please tell them to pay the bar tab.
- So they left...
- Yes.
They were supposed
to check out this morning.
I kept calling their room,
they never answered
and the maid found the room empty.
They were supposed to pay 260 Lei,
but they ran away.
Not good. Do you happen to have
an address or their ID details?
Believe me, for solving the case,
it's very important
that we find
these soulless psychopaths.
I have their check-in card.
Give me a second.
The name is Ciupitu Mihnea,
ID number RX147440...
- Yes, I can see that.
- And here's the address.
- Can I keep this?
- Yes, it's a copy.
Perfect.
Hello... officer.
- Thank you, good bye.
- Bye. You're welcome.
- Hi, how are you?
- Pretty good.
Do good and good things
will come to you.
Duty calls!
They're gone.
They left this morning.
- But I have an address. Let's go.
- Where?
- To Bucharest, where else?
- Now?
Do you want to go
after they claim the prize? Step on it!
What are you doing, man?
How are we supposed to find the place?
We need a map.
No, we don't. He's got Internet.
- Haven'! you got Internet on your cell?
- I do.
Use that Google app,
the one that shows the address.
- Do you have lntemet on your phone?
- Yes, 4G!
4G? What's that?
It used to be 3G,
now ifs 4G. It's faster.
- Let's see if we can find it.
- Write down Cosoveni St, Bucharest.
Check this out.
- I need an lntemet connection.
- Don't you have lntemet?
I do but... I have pre-pay.
I ran out of credit.
Fuck that 4G of yours!
We'll buy some credit later.
What if the police pull us over?
Then we're in trouble.
We'll have to walk home.
Can't we talk our way out of it?
Yes, in our town,
where they know us.
So what happens
if they pull us over?
Nothing much.
They'll take the car and fine you.
- You kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not.
And you're telling me now?
- Did we have a choice?
- Here, take the wheel.
How much is the fine?
- I don't know. About 1,000 Lei.
- How much?
At least 1,000 Lei.
- What are you doing, man?
- I think we'd better turn back.
Are you crazy?
We can't turn back now!
Think about it.
What if we don't find the ticket,
but I get pulled over,
they give me a nice big fine
and take my car away?
But what if nobody pulls us over
and we find the ticket?
You enjoy taking risks.
I'm not like that.
Let's say we go back.
Then what?
You still won't have the money for Gina.
Not to mention the house!
I could go there and find her.
The fortune tellers said
she was waiting for me to save her.
Did you really believe
those crazy women?
If they'd known the future,
they'd have told me the match score.
Anyway, I think Gina is fine
with that Italian guy.
Don't tell me you haven't thought
that she may not want to come back.
That's why she asked for more money
than you can get.
Stop it, Gina isn't like that!
How much does she make?
It can't be less than 1,000 € a month.
- Around 1,000.
- See?
She could have saved the money
in two months if she wanted to.
I could be wrong,
but just think about it...
Please don”: smoke in the car.
You don't know Gina.
She's not like that.
And if I can get the money,
she'll come home.
And how are you planning
to get the money in two days?
If the police take my car,
it'll be your fault.
- And we'll split the fine.
- What?
- What did he say?
- Nothing.
- Give me some money, I'm broke.
- What did you say?
Give me some money.
Didn't I lend you the money to pay
that gypsy?
I only have 7 Lei left.
Here, take 11 Lei.
- This is all my the money.
- I have 5 Lei...
We still need 70.
Where do we get it from?
- Are you sure you have no money left?
- Yes!
Here's my wallet.
It's empty.
I really am broke.
If we don't pay, we can'! go.
Then we can say good-bye
to our ticket and to the prize money.
There! Rob me of every last penny!
When we find the ticket,
I should take half the money.
We agreed to split the prize equally
and everybody gets half.
Here.
Wait a second. Shall we give
the young lady a ride?
- Come on, pull over there.
- I want the change.
- Take it, you Scrooge.
- You thief.
Hello! Where are you heading?
- To Buftea. And you guys?
- To Bucharest, but it's on our way.
Hop in!
Thanks.
Thanks!
- Hi. I'm Pompiliu.
- Codrua. Nice to meet you.
We know a Codrua.
Dinel likes drinking
with her husband.
- Where are you from?
- From the village.
And why are you
going to Buftea?
I'm going to audition
for Romanians Got Talent.
- Can you sing?
- I manage.
Did you hear that, boys?
Beautiful, talented and smart!
Do they record
the show in Buftea?
Yes, at the film studio there.
And what are you going to sing?
Several songs.
Such as?
- "Give me back my nights".
- What?
Give me back my nights
and my sunny days
Give me back my dreams,
though some may hurt
Give me back my summer evenings
filled with long walks
And the dawns that often caught us
hand in hand on the road
- You're very talented.
- Thanks.
There's a severe lack of talent
on TV these days.
Too bad no one sings
like in the old days anymore.
Like Mirabela Dauer,
Corina Chiriac, Marina Scupra...
- Delia has a great voice.
- Give me a break...
And she's hot.
We used to have great artists.
Nowadays, not so much.
- Right?
- Well...
- You know what? I'm sure you'll win.
- Thanks.
Do you want to go to the seaside
with me afterwards?
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- I do...
Of course you do.
- Do you want to be a singer?
- A singer or an actress.
Very nice! We don't have
any great actors anymore, either.
I used to wait in line for hours
just to see Birlic or Caragiu.
Nobody holds a candle to them nowadays.
And the movies are so bad.
I saw a terrible film the other day.
One of these new Romanian movies,
about two idiots carrying a bag of drugs
from Constana to Bucharest.
It was awfully boring.
You can put your leg
over here if you like.
No, it's OK, I'm fine here.
Romanians are bad at making movies.
We have such a beautiful country,
but they only show doom and gloom,
the slums, the thugs, you know...
They don't capture the essence
of our country...
Here we are. The studios.
Thank you very much.
What are you auditioning for?
Isn't it a bit late for an audition?
I'm sleeping at a friend's place.
I'll audition first thing in the morning.
- Where does your friend live?
- Right here, in that building.
We'll see you there.
It's late and you never know...
That's OK, I'll be fine.
We like to help,
so we'll see you there.
I think I can buy some credit
from that machine.
- It's been nice meeting you.
- Yes, indeed. Thanks for the ride.
Wait up, guys!
My cousin has an apartment
in Constana...
Well, actually in Ovidiu,
but it's close.
What the hell are you doing here?
Codrua! Wait! Wait!
- Leave me alone!
- Where are you going?
- Are you going to see that wanker?
- I won't talk to you anymore.
- Tell him to come here!
- Go away!
I'll show him!
Tell him to come down here!
- Enough! Stop it!
- Codrua, tell him to come down.
What are you doing?
- Leave me alone! Cosmin!
- Hey, zip it!
- Be quiet, you'll wake everyone up!
- Let go of me!
Give me that!
Wait up! Here.
Screw him! I'd slap him so hard,
he would hit the floor.
- She took advantage of us, Dinel.
- True.
- What do you know...
- Women!
Pretending to audition
for Romanians Got Talent...
She was obviously talentless.
And the show isn't even recorded
here anymore.
Hasn't been for a long time.
What a fucking liar!
- Damn liar!
- Damn liar, indeed!
“Please make the payment.“ Pompiliu,
give me the money from your other sock.
This really is the last money I have.
I mean it.
All right, guys.
We have 4G Internet.
- Let me see.
- Hello, Gina?
Look here.
I'm not sending you any money.
I'm tired of getting you out of trouble!
If you want money,
ask your Giuliano for it!
I won't send a dime, hear?
Not 1 Leu!
And go to hell
with that Giuliano of yours!
Whether you're by the sea or
on the beach, you can both kiss my ass.
So long, bitch!
What did she say?
She didn't answer,
it was her voice-mail.
- Let's go.
- Are you sure?
Yeah. Those thieves won't know
what hit them.
- They'll see!
- Oh, shit!
- What?
- We're running out of battery.
- Come on!
- Yeah.
Straight ahead, then turn left.
Bucharest sure is beautiful.
There's a reason it's our capital.
You can't find a toilet
in this great capital of ours.
- I told you to go at the gas station.
- That was three hours ago.
Hold it in 'til we get there.
Then I'll just go and ask the thieves
to let me use their toilet, right?
They'll understand,
they're human after all.
You can't even find a tree
in this damn city!
Look, there's one over there.
And another one...
In the middle of the road?
I need a park or something.
- There's a park right there.
- We have to turn left here.
- He needs some relief.
- We passed the intersection!
We'll go back. Take me to the park!
I'll drop him off near the park.
Turn the car around,
I'll be joining in.
Shit.
- I knew I shouldn't have done it.
- Maybe he won't notice.
Not good... Let's see what he says.
Good evening. Agent Guspeneck.
License and registration, please.
Just a moment.
Here you are.
You know why I pulled you over,
don't you?
Did I cross the white stripe?
Because you turned left
where you weren't allowed to.
Oh, right.
If you knew, why did you do it,
Mr. Daniel?
We're not from around here.
We've just arrived in Bucharest
and we're looking for a street...
What do we have here...
Apart from the fact that your
technical inspection is way overdue...
Do you know what the penalty is for driving
a vehicle whose colour has been altered?
- Pardon? I don'! understand.
- What is it you don'! understand?
I don't understand.
Look. What colour is the car
supposed to be?
- White.
- And what colour is your car?
White.
Please stop joking.
It's white.
Alright. Get out of the car
for a moment, please.
- What is it?
- Take a good look.
What colour is the car?
White!
Quit fooling around.
It's white, officer.
Come on, stop pulling my leg.
Tell me, what colour is it?
- What colour is the car?
- White.
This is getting out of hand.
Sir! Come over here for a moment.
We'll settle it now.
Sir, would you mind telling us
loud and clear,
what colour this car is?
White.
Officer Andrei, can you hear me?
Officer Andrei, can you hear me?
Drive carefully.
I'm letting you off with a warning.
Yes, sir!
What a lucky idiot you are, Dinel!
Come on! Where did Pompiliu go?
Now what? Do we just ask them
to give us the bumbag?
Or maybe ask them if they found
a 6 million ticket inside...
I don't think we should
mention the ticket.
You're a right genius, Dinel.
I think we should ask them nicely
to give us the bumbag.
- The ticket might still be there.
- And they'll oblige.
I say we call the police.
Don't chicken out!
Let's fight them. End of story.
What are you doing?
Sile, that's enough! Quit it!
Don'! do anything like that again,
or I'll shit my pants.
Stop, you'll wake up
the whole neighbourhood!
What if a secret service agent lives
nearby? We're not home.
We need to come up with a plan.
- I think we can climb this fence.
- Are you crazy?
Let's wait,
they'll come home eventually.
We must talk and come up
with the best solution.
- This is not OK.
- It's perfectly OK.
- It's not OK!
- Hey, come back.
Come on.
Sile!
Sile!
Sile!
We'll end up in jail
if someone sees us!
- Sile!
- Did anyone ring the doorbell?
Does he have a dog?
This is wrong.
We can't break into a house
like common thieves.
We'll just take what's ours.
We won't steal a thing.
We can take back what's ours
without committing "bulgiary".
God will punish us!
We're taking back what's ours,
understand?
We're even.
Not stealing anything.
If we did take anything else,
like a souvenir, then it'd be bad
and may God strike us down!
Fine, as long as we're only taking
what's ours by right...
- What are you doing?
- I think that if we pulled it like this...
Make sure it doesn't fall...
Can you squeeze your hand
through there?
I don't think I can.
Guys! Why don't we just use the door?
It's open...
We could.
Hey! Wait up!
We're never going to find
that bumbag.
We will!
I hope they haven't taken it with them.
They may have thrown it away
somewhere.
Damn! Someone's coming!
Someone's coming!
Didn't he tell you to bring
the backgammon board? Idiot!
Luckily, I have it.
I thought that other guy
was supposed to bring it.
Fetch it from the bedroom.
Wait, it's here.
I'm feeling lucky tonight.
We'll make some cash.
That was close.
I won't let you talk me into
anything like this ever again!
If he'd taken another step,
he'd have seen me.
- What's that?
- What have you got?
The bumbag!
You lucky moron!
Open it!
- There's the icon...
- Wait, wait a minute...
- Where's the ticket?
- I put it in here...
- Where is it?
- They must've claimed the money!
Do you think they'd still be playing
backgammon if they had?
Where's that ticket?
What are you doing here?
Sorry! We're leaving!
You broke into my mother's house?
- No!
- Wait! My friend!
- ...the ticket...
- My mother's sick!
- What are you doing?
- The lottery ticket... The bumbag.
Wait a minute! Quiet!
Oh, ifs you?
Hey, look here! It's the guy
with the bumbag.
What do you want?
What ticket?
That's my bumbag.
- So what?
- I put a lottery ticket in it.
- There was no ticket.
- Yes, I put it there.
- I'm telling you there was no ticket.
- Listen to me!
I bought a lottery ticket, I put it in here
and you stole my bumbag.
- Remember'?
- Yeah.
And now that's the winning ticket.
Had there been a winning ticket in it,
I'd have found it and I'd be out of here.
- What was the prize?
- 6 million €.
6 million?!
You lost 6 million €?
What an idiot!
How could you lose 6 million €?
Dinel!
Are you sure you put that ticket
in the bumbag?
I sort of remember putting it in there.
"Sort of"?
Did I hear that correctly?
I think so.
But on second thought,
- ...I may have put it elsewhere.
- And where did you put it?
I don't know...
You're such an idiot.
If you had put it there,
we'd all be rich by now.
You fool! You should have
left it in there!
We could've all have been rich!
I can'! believe it!
We spent so much money on gas
for nothing...
- Hi.
- Cheers!
- Who's playing?
- Chiajna against Petrolul.
- Who did you bet on?
- I didn't. I'm just watching the game.
- Here.
No, no. You'd better bring me...
...some water.
- Bring him the usual, I'll pay for it.
- Don't.
- I want to keep my vices in check.
- As you wish!
- So, just water?
- Mineral water!
There's a good side
to losing the prize.
Again with that story
about you losing the jackpot?
We won, but we lost the ticket, get it?
You lost it, and someone else
may have found it.
What?
- What do you mean?
- He found it and claimed the money.
- Look.
- Who?
"The grand prize, worth 6 million €,
was won by a Bucharest resident, 47,
"who guessed all the winning numbers
"and brought the ticket
to the Lottery headquarters."
- Still want mineral water?
- Not now.
"When our reporters asked him
what he'd do with the money,
"the winner said that he would
"quit his job
at the Ministry of Internal Affairs
and go on a long vacation
to some exotic locations."
What did I tell you
about the Secret Services?
You can try again.
Maybe you'll have better luck this time.
How about it, Sile?
I'm done gambling. I have a job,
I have responsibilities.
Will you take
your chance again, Dinel?
You can't win the lottery twice.
It's impossible!
- See you, boys.
- Bye!
What have I got to lose?
I've lost everything, anyway.
- Give me a ticket!
- Come with me.
Take good care of this one.
Stick it to the fridge door!
Gina?
Are you trying to kill me?
- How are you? Are you back for good?
- Yes.
- How did you...
- I simply left.
- How about Giuliano?
- He had no choice.
How was your trip home?
Are you tired? Are you hungry?
- I don't have much food, but...
- I'm fine.
You should've called me,
I would've picked you up.
And waste your money on a cab ride?
- I would've surprised you...
- Never mind that.
Tell me how you've been doing.
You know, the usual.
Wasting your time
with Sile and Pompiliu, right?
A little bit...
What's this?
Nothing. Forget about it.
The 6/49 lottery draw
has just begun.
The total prize value
of tonight's draw
is over 2 million Lei!
The first winning number is 41.
The second winning number is 43.
The third winning number is 17.
The fourth winning number is 39.
42 is the fifth winning number.
The last drawn number is 40.
We now repeat
tonight's winning numbers:
11, as, 40, 41, 42 and 43.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
unbelievable. It's never happened before!
Five out of six numbers
are consecutive.
I think this is a first
in the history of the Lottery.
The odds for so many consecutive
numbers being drawn are really small!
My colleagues are telling me we have
a message from the technical board...
Yes, Horaiu, I'm listening.
There seems to be a winning ticket in the
2nd category. Five winning numbers!
For this category,
the prize is 38,000 Euro...
Why did you stick it to the fridge?
This corner looks more...
Let me!
If we wet it down a bit...
Try it from this side.
Yes, yes, it's working!
Let's just leave it like this.
We could just take the fridge with us!
Come on!
One, two, three!
Let's go! Up and away!
