Is he here?
You know he is.
Well can you call him?
We'd like to talk.
Class is over for today, lads.
Unless you fancy signing up
for the next one.
You know,
French, I like you.
Do you?
But you can't run
a business for shit.
We can.
Our schools are growing
and turning a profit,
while your traditional
style of teaching's
becoming more
obsolete by the day.
Oh, really? Why is that?
Because you
dish out black belts
like they're
penny sweets?
Oy! You can tell your man
to put his tape measure away.
It's only a matter
of time, French.
I have cash here today.
I can pay to
transfer the name
on the lease into
my corporate account.
You can walk away
a rich man. No shame.
What do you say?
I say
you're full of shit.
French, $10,000
will buy
your lease today.
Next week,
my offer will be 7.
The following week, 5.
Can you see
where this is going?
Do you wanna get
your shoes off my mat?
Ugh. For once in your life,
make a smart decision...
I said...
get those shoes
off my mat.
Or what?
I guess we can do this the
old-fashioned way, couldn't we?
Yeah?
You and I could have
a little dance around this mat.
See who comes out on top.
If you win,
all right,
I'll move out today.
But if I win,
then you three
can get the fuck out,
and don't ever show your face
around here again.
You wanna fight me?
Oh, I'll fight
all three of you cunts.
Like a kung fu movie?
Yeah, that's it, mate.
Like a fucking
kung fu movie.
Come on, then.
All right!
How long was I out?
It's Tuesday, mate.
Just keep the ice on your nose.
You'll be okay.
Close the door on
the way out, lads. Yeah?
Come on.
Your back kick...
Totally sloppy,
French.
Yeah, of course it was.
Was some show
you put on there, French.
Let's just hope
those blokes
don't come back
and torch the place.
My insurance
just expired.
You're in trouble,
aren't you?
Yeah, you could say that.
Don't suppose you got
to talk to your man, did you?
I mean,
I could really use
the extra cash.
It's not for you.
Look, you're a tough guy.
You're also a good guy.
I ain't that good, mate.
You saw what I did
to that lot?
Your life would be a lot easier
if you sign over the lease.
Come on, for 10 grand?
What am I gonna do
with 10 grand? I've gotta pay
the bank back first,
then I'll have to get a car
have to pay the rent,
and then what?
It's my gym.
I built the whole thing
from scratch.
I plastered
those walls myself.
I cut the mats.
I worked too hard
to have dickheads like that
come in, and steamroll
all over it.
Come on, man.
I need your help.
I'll do anything
to keep this place.
French...
People say that all the time,
but they rarely mean it.
Well, I mean it.
I'm up for it.
This line of work, it doesn't
lead to a better life.
The money's good,
but it comes at a price:
Demands
on your conscience.
I'm your friend.
I don't wanna be the guy
who drags you into this,
French.
Come on,
I'm a big boy, Alex.
I can look after myself.
I'll remind you that
you said that.
It's not really up to me.
You're gonna have to
sell yourself to Tommy.
Tommy?
Yeah, Tommy.
It's his operation.
No one works for Tommy
that he doesn't approve of.
Now, I'll make
the introduction,
but you are gonna
have to convince him
that you're up to the work.
Thanks, Alex.
Don't thank me, French.
It's not that kind of job.
I know you're in there, French.
I heard you on the fire escape.
You're three months late!
I'm close to calling
some nasty fucks to get it.
The gym's in a bit of
a slump at the moment.
But I'm hoping
it's gonna pick up.
Who gives a shit?
Just pay up!
Just give me one week.
Okay? One week.
Maybe, in that time,
you can fix the garbage chute
in this shithole.
Just pay your fucking rent!
Loser!
Yeah, all right.
Watch how you move.
Don't swagger, it weakens you.
Speak softly,
make them listen to you.
Look at anybody
with true power.
They don't make
flamboyant gestures.
They keep it tight.
Concise.
And, above all,
avoid eye contact.
Why's that?
Because that's
your trump card.
Save that for when you wanna
hammer a point home.
And don't go carving out
a reputation.
Leave that to me.
I've got a team of lawyers
on call 24/7. You don't.
Just tell them you're
doing collections for Tommy.
My name's all
you'll ever need.
Can you look
after yourself?
Yeah.
Speak up if you're gonna
do collections for me.
Yes, I can look
after myself.
I was a paratrooper in
Her Majesty's service, 15 years.
I've seen my fair share
of firefights and fracas, so...
- Yeah, I'll get it done.
- Are you sure?
The roads I'll have
you driving down,
the doors I'll have
you knocking down,
they're a long way
from Her Majesty's service.
Listen, Mr. Kowalski, uh...
I really need this job,
so you don't have
to worry about me.
I've been fighting for
as long as I can remember,
and I'll crack a skull or two
if I have to.
I'll hold you to that.
I got a guy who
won't mind sharing the vig.
He's got a full plate
this weekend so
it's a good time for you
to start learning the ropes.
He may be coming off
a decade-long bender,
but he is one of my best.
Sounds good.
And get yourself
a nice suit,
you need to look professional
when you represent me.
Fuck.
You're early.
It's 9 o'clock.
Mm. Get in.
Aw, sh...
Yeah, you'll get used to it.
I'm Sue.
French.
You don't sound French.
I'm not.
Tommy give you the whole
"representing me" suit speech?
He did, actually.
You got the vig breakdown?
Jesus, Tommy likes to
get his money's worth, yeah?
Okay. But tell me, you done much
of this kind of work?
Not really, mate.
This is my first day.
Well isn't that
just fucking peachy?
Heh-heh-heh.
I'll be honest with you, newbie.
It's not an easy way
to make a cake, you know?
We earn our money
the hard way here.
It's all right.
I'm a grafter.
I don't need a grafter.
I need someone with big balls
and a fast fist.
Lucky for you,
I got both.
- Oh, have you now?
- Yeah.
Well you go to the gym,
do you?
Look, mate.
I can handle myself,
all right?
So you don't need to
worry. I got your back.
Well, you better.
Or this partnership's
gonna be very swift.
Look, I could use
a coffee, huh?
You drive.
My head's fucking pounding.
You ever driven a car
like this before?
I ain't never even seen a car
like this before, mate.
Treat her with the respect
that she deserves.
And do me a favor.
Watch the whitewalls.
Anything else?
Yeah, we drive on the right side
of the road here.
Yeah, well done. I've
never heard that one before.
- Hi.
- How you doing? Ahem.
I'll take two cups and a cup
of coffee, please, yeah?
Sure. Cream and sugar
in your coffee?
Yeah, please. One taste
of Italy and, uh, one vanilla.
Here you go, Frenchie.
I got you vanilla.
You know what? It's a bad idea
for me, I think.
I'm all right.
Do you want it?
I'm good.
Here we go,
2731 Vanowen Street.
No, no, keep it.
I slept on my spectacles
again last night.
I cracked them in half.
Tommy never said
you were no limey.
Yeah, I'm a limey.
But don't worry.
Lived in America
long enough to be able
to take that
as a compliment.
Wasn't meant as one.
So who we got?
"Oliver Waldstein. Ollie."
$17,500 in the hole.
What's the number
beside the name?
Ah, it's a 10.
What's a 10 mean?
A physical warning
with some prejudice.
Does it say there was
any other calls from us?
Name next to the number
says, "The Serb."
The Serb's
a fucking meathead.
Right.
That good or bad?
It's neither. Shall we?
Officially, we're mediators,
not enforcers.
But sometimes that line
gets blurred.
And if you
find that troubling,
detach yourself.
It's easy to say.
Not everyone can.
So what do we do
if they're armed?
They probably ain't. It would've
said so in the paperwork,
so, uh,
don't worry, Doris.
You'll be just fine,
okay?
What are you doing?
Give it a knock already,
will you?
All right.
And then what?
I don't know. Ask if Ollie can
come out to play or something.
Goddamn it, Clive.
Shut the fuck up. Someone's
at the door. Just be quiet.
Oh, sh...
One of them
looks like Sue.
- Are you fucking kidding me? Sue?
- Sue? Sue who?
Who is she?
It's not a "she."
Try again. You didn't
knock hard enough.
Get the door. Say whatever
you have to say,
- just stall them, okay? Please.
- Are they cops?
You wish they were cops.
They collect for Big Tommy.
- Is that a gun?
- No, Trista, it's a pistol.
Where did you get
a pistol? And who's Big Tommy?
You need to stay here,
and get the door.
I want you to go over
to the door
and don't let them in, okay?
- Just go. Go. You'll be fine.
- Don't push me.
I told you, didn't I?
Hello, sweetheart.
We're here to see Oliver.
He-He ain't here.
Well we kind of
know he's in there...
Get lost, asshole.
You have the wrong house.
Out the back.
- Mate, mate, out the back.
- Go, go, go.
Ah. Okay, give me the
keys, and go after them.
- What?
- Come on!
What do you mean?
Go after them.
I'll meet you around...
Give me the keys,
newbie! The keys!
Jesus Christ.
Shit.
He just fucking shot at me!
Were you hit?
- No!
- Then go!
- He just fucking...
- Go after him!
- Fucking hell.
- Go!
- You motherfucker!
- Jeez, man!
Get out of
the fucking car!
Get out,
motherfucker!
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit!
Oh, fuck!
Oh, shit.
- You fucking fuck.
- Oh, fuck!
Fuck!
Sit up!
So the police are gonna be here
in a minute, Oliver.
Do I need to worry about
what you're gonna tell them?
- No, sir.
- You've been having
a good time with
someone else's money, Ollie.
And there's still
the issue of $17,500
that needs
to be addressed.
- So address it...
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
...and consider
this a warning.
What's wrong with you?
I banged my
head off the concrete.
My feet are killing me.
I didn't realize
we were doing
this much running.
Maybe you should've left
your dancing shoes at home.
I brought them
with the suit, didn't I?
Maybe
you shouldn't have.
Was it really necessary
to smash the door
into that bird's face?
Actually, yes,
it was.
Here. Take us
to the next one.
So we're supposed
to be debt collectors, yeah?
We didn't collect anything.
A 10's a warning
with prejudice.
No vig, but Tommy
pays $300 each for those,
so, hey, you know?
What's next on the vig?
"Harvey Small.
Lankershim Boulevard."
Should've taken Sepulveda.
Frenchie, come on.
Get with the program.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm still trying to
come to terms
with the fact
that I've been shot at.
You know,
you expect it in Iraq,
you don't expect it
in the fucking suburbs.
Wait a minute.
You saw some action, yeah?
Yeah. I've hurt
a few feelings, yeah.
Well what's
the problem, then?
But you said if they were armed,
it would've said so in this.
Yeah?
Do you remember that?
Well, news flash, mate:
They were armed.
Did you complain
so much over there?
All right, here we go.
- Harvey's Auto Finance.
- Yeah.
Harvey's got
a dire gambling problem.
He's over 100 grand
in the pit,
which makes this a $4000
vigorish on the number five.
Right, okay,
so the lower the number,
the tougher the collection,
but the more it pays, yeah?
That, plus Harvey
thinks he's a player
all of a sudden these days,
you know?
Hired these low-rent heavies
out of South Central.
Got wise with Tommy,
which Tommy did not like.
Which is why we're getting
4 grand for this.
Last visit was
Mad Alex and the Serb,
but they left with their
tail between their legs.
So how did Tommy
take that?
Standard procedure.
He upped the vig,
and he sent us instead.
Let me just get something
straight, all right?
Last job was a 10, yeah?
Should've been
a walk in the park,
but I was shot at,
you ran some dickhead over,
and I was dragged
along by a moving car.
Now this one's
a five, yeah?
But you're telling me
last time, Mad Alex and the Serb
got marched out
by a bunch of gangbangers.
Now, I'm sorry.
I know I'm new to this,
but I think Tommy needs to
rethink his system.
That's all I'm saying.
One man's 10 is another
man's five, I guess.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
You're up.
Excuse me, we're, uh...
We're looking for Harvey.
What can I do for you,
gentlemen?
- Are you Harvey?
- No.
Maybe you can
take us to see Harvey.
Well, he's busy.
Is there something specific
I can help you with?
Listen, mate.
Just, uh, point us
in the direction of Harvey,
and we'll be on our way.
Jeanette, make that
call to Mr. Massey.
I sure hope that phone call's
only for Harvey.
Hey, Sue.
Yeesh.
Think it's time to test
that mettle of yours, Frenchie.
It's just "French."
Oh, fuck me.
Look, look.
Whatever he's paying you,
I'll double it! I'll tri...
Ahh!
Oh, my God.
Oh, no!
- Give me your legs.
- We can make a deal.
Gimme your fucking legs.
What the fuck is going on?
I think you broke my nose.
If I was you,
I wouldn't move, Harvey.
Help!
You gonna fucking
do something or what?
Excuse me,
I'm watching Harvey, okay?
You ain't gonna
get away with this.
Shut up!
No, no, no! Help.
No, no.
- Frenchie.
- There are no witnesses.
You could just walk away,
let me be
and I'll make it the best
financial decision you boys made
since hiring that
limo driver on prom night.
Look, just tell Tommy
I wasn't here.
Whatever the vig is, I will...
I will quadruple it.
To be honest, Harvey,
your vig ain't that special.
Wh-What does
he want you to do?
You don't wanna know.
What? What is it?
It's a kneecap.
- Or two.
- Oh, no.
- Guys, no, no, no.
- May I?
No!
I'm gonna call the cops.
God...
You might wanna run that
by Harvey, Jeanette.
Never mind
the cops, Jeanette!
Call me a goddamn
ambulance!
All right, pull over here.
Why? This isn't on the list.
Relax, Frenchie. Just
got a quick pickup to make.
- Oh, fuck's sake.
- What the fuck did you do?
What did you do?
I asked you one thing.
To watch the whitewalls.
Yeah?
First of all, mate, you got
me doing all the driving here,
driving you around
like you're Miss fucking Daisy,
just 'cause you've had
one too many shandies,
and you look
and you smell like shit.
Then you have me take point
on a job I've never
even done before,
and then,
after dodging bullets
I get attacked by a couple
of the biggest bastards
I've ever seen
before in my life,
and it's not even
fucking noon yet.
So forgive me
for not giving a shit
about the whitewalls
on this fucking boat.
You done with your hissy fit?
No, I don't think I am.
I don't know whether
you were paying attention,
but I just got thrown
through a fucking wall!
I wouldn't be too sensitive
about that, kid,
after the way
you handled yourself.
You're good for business.
And I'm sorry
that I made you drive
my luxury, vintage
1971 Coupe deVille.
Thought it'd be
a nice gesture
to give you a sense of
self-worth your first day
but I guess it wasn't.
It is a pretty nice car.
When we get through
this weekend...
If we get through
this weekend,
we can talk about
my whitewalls, yeah?
So that was a five,
was it, yeah?
Five.
More of a fight
than a regular five.
You can say that again,
mate.
Let me tell you
something, Frenchie.
You've got a dark side
to you, brother.
Man, you took these guys
out like a champ.
And you like
to train every day,
so I thought you'd
appreciate the workout.
No, actually, mate,
I didn't appreciate it.
Well maybe I did
a little bit.
Good.
I'll be right back.
Wipe your face.
You look like a vampire.
Check this out.
You know there's meant to be
two L's in "thrilling," right?
- Was that you?
- Yeah.
Yeah? Oh, shit,
you were in a movie?
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.
A few old B-movies
back in the day, you know?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
That's pretty cool, man.
Looks like
a piece of shit, though.
Yeah, it was, but at least
I'm on the poster, yeah?
Looks just like you, mate.
Did they cut your eyes out
and stick them on, did they?
I'm hungry.
Let's get something to eat.
You're a ninja,
then, yeah?
"Gordon Karp."
What an awful name.
I hope that's a fucking alias.
This is a pretty
nice neighborhood.
So it should be.
Gordo's a two.
A 10, a five, and a two
in one afternoon.
It's a busy day
in the office, Frenchie.
Gordo,
he's in the hole 40 K,
we get half of that,
we're in business, yeah?
Hang on a minute.
Harvey owed 100 grand, right?
What was he, a five?
This guy owes 40 grand.
He's a two.
How's that work?
Tommy dishes out
the numbers based on
the level of violence
the client wants.
There's no rhyme
or reason to it,
so don't waste gray matter
trying to figure that one out.
Gordo's a two.
A bake and take.
"Bake and take"?
Yeah. Turn up the heat
and take the money.
"Turn up the heat
and take the money."
For fuck's sake.
What do you twos want?
Well, not you, queen bee,
that's for sure.
What'd you call me?
For a big guy, you got beautiful
eyes. You could be a model.
It's best you two jokers
come back on Halloween.
Listen to this guy. Give him
a compliment. Some people, huh?
You should take
the compliment, mate.
- He doesn't give many.
- Yeah.
I got shit to do.
I bet you can shift
some fucking tin.
- You're a big guy.
- That's two compliments
in quick succession.
You're on a roll.
You need to fuck off,
Punch and Judy.
Okay.
Okay, maybe we got off
to a bad start here.
I'm Sue.
This is French.
We're here to see Gordon.
Is he in?
No, he's not in.
My compliments aren't
good enough for you?
Fuck you, dago piece of...
Shit.
Gordie?
Don't say anything,
Angelica.
Good morning,
Mr. Karp, Mrs. Karp.
Presume you both
know why I'm here.
No.
Forty thousand.
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha.
There is that.
You didn't take care of that?
You dumb son of a bitch.
Jeez, where's Manno?
The hell's going on here?
What do you guys think you are,
a couple of fucking
lone-star desperadoes? Coming to
my home to intimidate me?
Do you have
any idea who I am?
I'm in with Big Tommy.
Gordo. We work for Big Tommy,
you fucking fool.
Guess that changes things.
Listen, you tell me
how much to pay,
and I'll make sure
you have every penny
- of it by noon tomorrow.
- This is what's gonna happen.
You're gonna take my man,
Mr. French
to whatever room
you keep all your cash,
and you will proceed to take out
as much capital as you can,
and hopefully,
when he counts it,
he doesn't
need to fuck you up.
Mrs. Karp can
stay down here with me.
In case hurting you doesn't
help, maybe I'll start on her.
Is that okay with you,
sweetheart?
He's not gonna
touch you, honey.
Gordo, I've been doing
this a long time.
I'll do whatever
it fucking takes.
The safe is
downstairs in the office.
- Angelica!
- Fuck you, Gordie.
That's right.
Fuck you, Gordie.
Come on.
Look, look,
I know I'm late.
I can't help it.
I-I-I'm a procrastinator.
I can't even pay a bill until
the second final notice comes.
It drives Angelica crazy.
I mean,
rightfully so.
Forty thousand, Gordie.
Let's go.
Yeah, yeah. They give you
a cutoff amount, right?
A figure that would suffice?
A compromise.
I will fuck you up, Gordie.
I will fuck you up.
Just stop trying to negotiate,
and just dig out the cash.
You're on a percentage, right,
huh? Listen, we can make a deal.
Five thousand for you
and 5 for Tommy.
You can buy a new suit with the
additional $500 cut he'd pay.
- Get up. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?
Hoo-oh!
Ugh! Oh!
Need a refill?
Sure, why not?
You know, your man wasn't
much of a bodyguard.
Hmm.
Manno is my lover,
not my bodyguard.
Was he now?
Was he your gardener as well?
No, that
position's still open.
I'm wondering...
Are you qualified?
Come on, Gordie.
Come on, Gordie!
Where's the key, Gordie?
Where's the key?
Hand me the key.
It's not there?
No, it's not.
Where's the key?
I can't remember.
I'm nervous.
- You're nervous, are you? Yeah?
- Yeah, I can't remember.
You're not gonna miss your
short-term memory much, are you?
Gordie, I haven't
got time for this.
Where's the fucking key?
Hurry up.
Is that it?
Give it to me. Come on.
Fuck me.
Ah.
What the fuck?
Jesus Christ,
there's over 100 grand in here,
you masochistic prick.
You had the money all along
and still chose a beating.
- The fuck is wrong with you?
- Aah!
I-I'm parsimonious.
It's not a game to these guys,
Gordie, all right?
It's not a game.
You need to work on
your self-preservation, mate.
- You listening? Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, fuck.
- I'm okay.
- You're finished, are you?
Yeah, yeah.
I'm finished.
You're both square.
You're good.
Lookit, Frenchie,
you're a good-luck charm.
This thing doesn't happen often.
Glad to see you
get your rocks off, mate.
Who pissed on your french fries?
Mm, yeah.
So I get that we had to rough
the guy up,
but did you need
to shag his missus?
Damn straight, I did.
She was smoking hot.
And opportunities
like that
don't fall into my lap
too often.
- That's a valid point, I guess.
- And?
I don't know.
I don't like being the reason
someone had
a fucking horrible day.
Better check that conscience,
Jiminy Cricket,
otherwise it's gonna be
a long weekend.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- He didn't give that up easy.
No, and get this, right?
The guy had
enough money on him
to be a loan shark himself,
not to owe one.
Still had to slap him about
a bit, though.
I don't understand people
sometimes.
Tell me about it.
I once hung a guy's kid
out the window
until he paid.
He had the money
all along.
I mean, it was
his own child.
You wouldn't have dropped
the kid, though, right?
God, I hope not.
I can't remember.
I must admit, Frenchie,
was being lazy that day.
I should've taken it out
on the father. Yeah?
A moral compass in this business
is like a pinless hand grenade.
Huh?
Okay.
You still got that wind
in your sails, Frenchie?
- Of course I have.
- That's them.
These guys ain't
on our docket, are they?
We got the money already,
right?
We don't make a penny getting
into it with these dickheads.
Yeah, we could run
from hired muscle,
but if Tommy finds out,
we might as well keep running.
Besides, hate to be the one
to break it to you...
part of your job description
is to watch my back.
Yeah, all right.
Don't leave it all up to me
this time, will you?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, shit.
Fuck.
Mm.
Order 27.
Order 27, your food is ready,
and, also, order 29.
Order 29, your food's ready.
I'll tell you what, today's
been a surreal day for me.
Is it like this
every time you go out?
No, gotta be
straight with you, Frenchie.
Today we had more
than our fair share.
You can say that again.
You seen my suit?
I've seen your suit.
Cheapest suit I've seen.
- I wouldn't worry too much.
- This suit cost me 89.99,
- tie included.
- You look like
a used car salesman.
Get rid of it. Ditch it.
I'll wear my gi, shall I?
Fucking hell.
I didn't have to crack
this many skulls in Iraq.
Come on. It wasn't
that bad, was it?
Everyone's first day's
difficult.
You'll get used to it.
As far as technique,
you're MMA, yeah?
Yeah, MMA.
You're a boxer, right?
Footwork's pretty good.
Yeah, I still got
the power, but...
speed's been going
for a long time now, yeah?
Tell you what, Frenchie.
Let's call it a night.
Take me home, and you pick me up
in the morning, yeah?
Okay.
Hey, sweetheart,
can you come get this please?
Be right there, sir.
Fuck.
So what's on the menu
for tonight?
Ugh, Coco got me work
on the Westside.
Two Arab sheiks
or something like that.
Big cashola.
Mm-hm.
Hey, wait a minute.
Come here.
Take a look at this.
- Look what I found.
- What?
Is that the one?
It sure is.
That's me right there.
I play the bad guy in this one.
Is that how you spell
"thrilling"?
Yeah, back then, it was
a little different, you know?
Plus, these low budgets,
you know how they are.
Yeah, I do.
Oh. Babe, I could, uh,...
really use some green.
How much you need, babe?
Mm...
Could put 300 to good use.
There you go.
- Thanks, babe.
- Let me zip you up, babe.
Yeah.
Listen,
I want you to be careful.
Barbosa called me today.
He was asking about you.
That's weird.
What'd he want?
Nothing really, but...
I know enough
about that creep to know
you don't wanna be
messing with him.
He's hurt a lot of people.
Don't worry. I'll be careful.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Hey, Sean.
How you doing, man?
Hey, Sue, what's up?
Hey, Lola's supposed
to be working.
- She coming in?
- Oh, you know how she is.
She'll be here.
One for the tab, yeah?
- So how's business?
- Business is good. You?
- I'm cruising, man. Cheers.
- Cheers.
- You good?
- Mm-hm.
Let's go.
What are you selling?
Give me a look.
It's already sold.
That's not what I asked.
I wanna see.
What kind's that again?
It's a German MP40.
- I doubt you've seen one.
- You doubt it?
Don't be condescending,
you fucking pedophile jerk.
- You working on my order?
- Don't worry, Tommy.
It's a rare piece.
It's a difficult one to find.
You better smile
if you're gonna talk like that.
Good job, boys,
on all three accounts.
I just got off the phone
with Rick's people in Reno.
Harvey's paid up in full.
So our stock has gone up
after yesterday.
I'm gonna give you
this sweet gig
that fell into my lap.
Hey, boss.
Hey, French.
- I heard you were on board.
- Alex.
It's a shame they saddled you up
with this piss-stained fossil.
How you doing, Alex?
- I'm all right.
- Oh, by the way,
we got the call about Harvey.
Don't worry. We got the job
done yesterday, so...
Whatever.
You got it, Padre?
Shall we go outside?
Sure. Tommy, French.
That's a nice piece, Alex.
Very expensive.
Understanding you need
a bigger arsenal, you must've
really got your cage shook bad.
I'm sorry,
it's a terrible thing,
losing your nerve.
Fuck you, old man.
I'll show you my nerve
any time you're ready.
I'll tell Lola
you said hello.
You keep drinking
yourself to sleep, Susan.
And remember something:
When you kiss her...
I used to cum in her mouth
after fucking her in...
Later.
You're a classy guy, Alex.
A very classy guy.
- Go enjoy your day.
- Tommy.
- You okay?
- I'm good, Tommy.
- Can you drive?
- Let's go.
All right, we'll talk about
the job in the Caddy.
Actually, Frenchie,
you mind driving?
The other side
of the road, right?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, all right.
I thought I told
you to get a nice suit.
Suit didn't make it
past the first day, Tommy.
Well I'm hearing good
things about yesterday.
Sue said you handled
yourself like a pro.
Yeah, cheers.
Did you enjoy it?
Ah, had its ups and downs,
but, yeah.
It was fine.
Fine?
Not the most
glowing review.
What do you think?
He's got potential, Tommy.
Oh, the old
"potential" line.
- Where is he?
- In his den.
Tommy. Ha, ha.
Tommy, my man.
It's good to see you,
man.
Take a seat, man.
Make yourself comfortable.
Fellas, you want something
to eat, drink?
- Something to calm your nerves?
- My nerves are fine.
- How are you?
- Oh, man,
I've never been an admirer
of the morning.
I do my best work at night.
But I get out of bed
for you, Tommy.
You know why, huh?
Because we're tight, right?
We got history.
And that's very important
to me.
It means I can trust you.
Of course.
You remember Sue?
Of course I do.
How you doing, Golden Boy?
I'm getting along.
That's French, the guy
I was telling you about.
It's good to
meet you, Frenchie.
It's good to meet you.
It's just "French."
What is that,
a limey accent and a frog name?
- This is a man of the world.
- Yeah.
- I'm diverse.
- Yeah, you sure are, Mr. French.
It's still just "French."
What have you got for us,
Barbosa?
I got this skinny, charming,
Irish motherfucker...
used to manage one of my joints
over on Melrose.
I found out that he's been
skimming from the till
to an inch of his life.
You know, this petty fuck
has been taking
more than double the tax tip.
You know what I mean?
It happens.
I can be a magnanimous
motherfucker.
Ask any of my crew.
Ask my girls.
I took this fucker in,
cleaned him up,
gave him a position,
wiped his ass,
and this motherfucker
takes and bites
the hand that feeds him.
Amanda.
Where are you going?
You should stay.
Listen in.
I want the whole world
to know...
that you cannot steal...
from Barbosa Fabioso.
Not without
paying the piper.
For fuck's sake.
Watch your tongue.
That's not what you said to me
when you proposed, my love.
How much did he steal from you?
Or as close as you can estimate.
What's that have to do
with anything?
We work on a percentage.
You busted him.
You must have some idea
how much he got away with.
What's that got to do
with the way you do business?
I'm paying you a hefty fee
right up front.
Think I'll have that drink.
What are we really
dealing with here?
Amanda, why don't you take
your girlfriends
out to the pool?
Take a swim. Splash, splash.
This is a personal problem
I need you to take care of.
- Are we good to go?
- The boys will find him.
Remember, we have a scale.
One being
the most severe beating,
and 10 being
a stern warning.
Where do you want
this kid to fall?
Right on to number one.
That'll be 20 grand.
Half up front,
balance on completion.
Billy.
Here, give me both of them.
That's his full name
and the last place he worked.
Should be enough
to get you started.
Sue.
Mr. French.
Nice to meet you.
So, what do you think
about this Barbosa bloke?
Typical of his watering hole,
you know?
Thinking he can buy himself
out of of trouble.
He probably can.
Twenty grand?
I mean, 20 grand
to slap some kid around.
No matter how much I make,
I'll never pay anyone
to do my dirty work.
Starting to feel sorry
for this Connor.
I learned a long time ago: Treat
these Johns as slabs of meat.
I know. Still trying
to get in the groove of that.
So what do you reckon?
Check the address
of the last club he worked at?
Give me a second.
Right over here
on the right.
Wouldn't it be better
to telephone these places first?
It seems like you'd save
a fortune in gas.
Some collectors like
to use the telephones.
Not me, Frenchie.
I like to get out there.
Take a little walk.
One knock on one door.
I'll get more information
than those jerk-offs will
- with 25 calls.
- Let's hope you're right.
We need to fill up again.
That's because you got
a lead foot.
Feather the pedal.
It's this one
here, then, yeah?
Yeah. Right here's good.
- Sure this is the place?
- Yep.
Okay. Got the keys?
You guys miss the sign outside
that says, "We're closed"?
No. We just wanna talk.
Real quick, man.
Yeah.
Okay. Obviously, you don't read
or understand English.
We're closed.
I'm busy. Okay?
So do me a favor
and piss off.
See, why do you gotta be so rude
and curse at us for?
There's no manners anymore.
He must be a tough guy.
Want us to go out
and come in again?
Would you like us to do that?
- Have we upset you?
- Okay.
You want manners?
I'll give you manners.
Would you two gentlemen
be so kind as to...
promptly remove yourselves
from the premises?
Please.
Motherfucker.
Come here, you...
Oh, you fucked up now, pal.
Joey!
What the hell's
going on in here?
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Everybody in this town
have a bloody bodyguard?
Shit. I know you.
Yeah. You're Sulinski.
Yeah, I've seen you around.
You work for Big Tommy,
don't you?
That's right, sunshine.
Indeed, I do.
Hell, I ain't gonna
mess with you, Sulinski.
You'd kick my ass.
Yeah.
But I don't know this fuck.
Well, you're about to find out
who he is.
Things just got
a little complicated.
What do you want?
You okay, Frenchie?
Does it look like
I'm fucking okay?
Now would be a good time
to use that jujitsu.
Oh, shit.
Let's talk about
Connor Mulligan and maybe
you can tell me where I find
that little leprechaun?
- That's what this is all about?
- Yeah.
Are you fucking kidding me?
Aah! Aah!
Connor quit a month ago.
He got into it with Barbosa.
But I gotta tell you,
he's a stand-up guy.
Whatever Big Tommy
sent you here for
is probably
fucking bullshit.
- Hey.
- God, will you stop that?
Okay, okay.
Listen, listen, listen.
He... He moved in with a fucking
barman from the club.
And you tell Big Tommy that
that's all I fucking know!
And stop fucking doing that
with that toothpick!
- Wait.
- Bite that fucking rail.
Put your face
on that fucking rail.
In 10 seconds,
I will repeatedly stomp
on the back of your head.
And what do you know?
It's settled.
Frenchie, get over here.
I could use your boot.
Okay. I'm gonna ask you
one more time.
Where do I find
this mick?
Wait, wait. All right!
Answer the fucking question!
His ex-roommate Tim.
- He... He...
- Yes?
He knows where
to find Connor!
His fucking address
is in the payroll sheet
on top of the bar,
all right?
Was that so difficult?
- Was that so difficult?
- No.
We're good.
Okay. Frenchie, you good?
Oh, yeah, mate.
I'm just fucking peachy, I am.
Oh, fuck.
Okay. This is it.
We got it.
Let's go.
Oh, fuck.
Listen, I'm sick
of the 20 questions.
You can handle this one,
yeah?
Oh, I can handle this one,
can I, Sue?
Yeah? I seem to be handling
all of them, mate.
I'd sooner take
20 questions
than having another
all-out brawl.
There you go.
You can ask the questions.
Thanks very much.
What the fuck?
I was downstairs
and saw smoke
coming out of your window.
Everything all right?
There's a lot of smoke coming
out of the kitchen window.
Shit! Stop!
All right, see that?
See how I did that?
Nice and easy.
No tears, no blood.
Nobody got hurt. Right.
Which one of you
lucky lads is Tim?
You can't come in
here like that.
That's right.
I'm gonna smash
your face in.
It's him. He's Tim!
It's him, yeah?
- Tim? We're gonna do this one.
- Out.
- Right, you. Piss off.
- Come on, get out.
- Get up, and get out.
- Okay, I'm going!
Wait, wait, wait. No.
I've been trying to call you
for a week. I swear.
I don't have the stuff anymore.
I sold most of it,
and I smoked the rest.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Look at me,
I'm fucking pathetic.
If you killed me,
you'd be doing me a favor.
Look, I'll pay Davey back,
okay? I swear.
Davey sent you, right?
Davey?
No?
Well, Christ.
What do you guys want?
Who'd I piss off now?
Looking for Connor Mulligan.
- Seen him?
- Who?
Fuck! Jesus, stop!
Stop!
Connor doesn't live here
anymore, okay?
He doesn't live here!
Fuck.
Wait. Why are you guys
after Connor?
He's a good guy.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.
Everyone keeps telling us
what a nice guy this thief is.
No. Connor's no thief,
man. Look.
Here, here, look.
He's an honest guy.
See?
I'm gonna keep this.
Oh, come on, no. That's
his only photo that...
Hang on a minute.
Did that son of a bitch
Barbosa send you two?
Connor Mulligan.
Where is he?
No, Barbosa's the
guy that needs whacking.
That bastard should die
a slow and painful death.
As for Amanda, she is
the cause of all of this.
So very interesting.
I'm gonna ask you one last time.
My man here's gonna take
his fist and crack your skull.
Where's Connor Mulligan?
Okay, okay.
He's moved in with some chick.
Down at Topanga. You know?
One of those, uh,
artist communities?
Bunch of rich,
white hippies
living on trust funds
and kombucha.
What a charmer. He seems to have
a girl in every port.
No, it's not like that, man.
He's a good guy.
So where is this honest Connor?
You got an address?
Uh... An address.
- Come on, mate. An address.
- Yeah. Yeah. Here.
- Do something.
- Here.
- Hurry up.
- No, that's not fuck... Uh...
Here.
Be fair, okay?
He doesn't deserve
- whatever that fuck paid you to do.
- Listen.
I'd keep off the drugs
for a bit if I was you.
Okay.
I don't know about dishing out
a number one on this Connor kid.
Seems like he's
Prince fucking Charming to me.
It's not for us to question.
Just to locate him
and dish it out.
But come on, mate.
How can you not question it?
Right? I mean,
it's not like we're maniacs
cruising around
looking for prey, is it?
We're meant to be
collecting debts,
not chalking up beatings
at will.
You remember
those blurred lines?
Today, we're enforcers for hire.
You know?
This job can be
a fucking roller-coaster,
Frenchie.
- You take lead at this next one.
- Oh, par for the course, eh?
You can quit any time,
newbie.
No, no, you're right.
I'm up for it.
Good. Because I liked
that smoke thing. That was good.
You liked that, did you?
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah?
But it's not gonna get you
in the room every time.
What do you suggest?
Other than kicking the door
off its fucking hinges,
what's the best way
to get inside?
Give him a little head-butt,
a tap.
Just a tap.
You don't wanna smash
his nose.
You wanna save that
for when you really need it.
Like you did with that kid
at Tim's, yeah?
- Precisely.
- Yeah.
- Just a tap.
- Just a tap.
- Nice and simple.
- Simple little tap.
All right. Got you.
- Good.
- Simple tap.
Just a tap.
This is it.
Hello, mate.
We're, uh, looking for Sandy.
Who's asking, doll?
- Oh, my God.
- Fuck me. That was a bit hard.
I said, "Tap him,"
not obliterate him.
I tried. It's not as easy
as you made it.
Take a seat.
It's okay.
I got a lot
of experience.
- Who the fuck are you?
- Are you Sandy?
Tell me where I can find
Connor Mulligan.
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.
She's only small.
I'm Sue. This is French.
Can you please...
tell us where
Connor Mulligan is?
I'm not telling you anything.
So if you two arrogant shits
leave right now,
we may not press charges.
So get the fuck out.
Did I do something
to offend you?
Was I being a little rough?
What do you think, Frenchie?
- Was I too rough?
- Get your pit bull away from me.
Oy, oy, oy, oy!
You're gonna
slap her senseless?
Get your hands off me. Let
the professional do his thing.
"Professional"?
Give me a break.
- Only weak men hit women.
- Shut it. All right?
I won't be able to stop him
from hurting you in a manner
that will blunt
that sharp tongue of yours.
Now's not the time to be
brave, all right?
Now's the time
to be sensible.
Jesus Christ!
You call that
being fucking sensible?
Connor has a heart of gold.
He picked me up when I was down,
and he settled me here.
He's kind, compassionate,
and caring.
Something you two would
never comprehend.
Even if I did know
something,
I wouldn't tell lowlife
cockroaches like you.
Yeah. We keep hearing about
what a wonderful cherub
this guy is.
But what we really wanna know
is where he is.
At the end
of the rainbow maybe?
This whole nightmare started
when she got her claws into him.
Who's "she"?
Barbosa's fiancée, Amanda.
That brat hounded Connor
until he caved in.
But that wasn't enough
for a bitch like her.
She had to tell Barbosa
to get her kicks.
Can you please just tell us
where Connor is?
No, I won't, Sue.
I'm not telling you
anything.
When you first strike a woman,
she may resist.
But it's that one shot...
that'll break the bone...
and dislodge the cartilage
across the muscle.
Lose a leg permanently.
Yeah. Doing this
permanent damage
usually does the trick.
If anyone knows where he is,
I'd wager that bitch does.
I'd bet my life
she's still trying
to see him right now.
You disapprove?
Well you wanted this job.
This is it,
- get used to it.
- I didn't say a word.
Last two days you had no issue
with fucking everybody up.
- That was different.
- I don't see how.
Every bloke I've had
a ruck with
has been trying
to take my head off.
That, I can deal with.
I'm up for dealing
with those tosspots.
Beating up some chick to find
where her ex-boyfriend is?
No, thanks, mate. That's not
in my fucking wheelhouse.
Not in your wheelhouse.
Guess what, freshman.
You'd better find
a new wheelhouse.
This guy doesn't like
to fuck around, yeah?
I don't think
you understand me.
We're in trouble if we
don't find this prick
and get him to Barbosa.
Forget the smiles,
forget all the handshakes.
This Barbosa's a fucking demon.
- Fuck me.
- Yeah, Barbosa just might.
So if I was you,
I'd get back on board.
You started this job.
You wanted this job.
You gotta finish it.
I'll tell you what.
Call it a night.
Go home. Sleep on it.
Drop me off. You pick me up
in the morning, yeah?
Sure you don't wanna drive?
You can't still be hungover,
can you?
Drink as much as I do,
the hangover never goes away.
But if it's too much work
for you...
It's all right, mate.
You're fine.
Anyway, kind of like it now.
Takes my mind
off all this shit.
Fuck.
So what do you reckon, Sue?
You think this bird's worth
all this trouble?
I think she's
a fucking skank.
Yeah, you're probably right.
Oh, we got a shit gig here,
haven't we, mate? Ahem.
Our job is basically
to help this lunatic Barbosa
keep shackles
on his slag of a fiancée.
Well it's a job
that pays well,
and I wouldn't think about it
too much if I were you.
A week ago, I would have
bombed a school for this job.
But after
the last two days...
I don't know how
you've done this so long,
and it hasn't took its toll.
It took its toll.
Don't worry.
Yeah? I've only done it
for two days,
and already I feel like
drinking myself into a coma.
Is that what you do, is it?
Does the drink numb the pain
of all the horrible shit
you've caused?
I'm surprised there's enough
booze in the world for that.
Do me a favor. Don't judge me,
tenderfoot, okay? Fuck you.
You think I don't care about all
the terrible things I've done?
Well, I do.
That's one of the reasons
why I drink myself
to sleep every fucking night.
What's your wife
think about it all?
I'm not married.
I was, but not anymore.
So why do you
still wear the ring?
As a reminder, I guess.
Reminder of what?
Not to get close
to anyone again.
That sounds like
a lonely life to me, mate.
Yeah. Well, it's my life.
It's shit that's ugly,
but it's mine,
and I fucking like it.
Yeah?
I got a kind of
a girlfriend.
She's a hooker.
She works at the club.
I doubt she'd piss on me
if I was on fire.
Oh, Frenchie. You know...
it's rare to have
certain people
like certain people
like us, you know?
"Us"? No, mate.
Ha, ha. No.
"You," you mean. Yeah?
Yeah, okay,
I'll take that.
So what happened
with the wife?
Eh...
Usual stuff.
I'm sorry, man.
I don't mean to pry.
No, no, no. It's okay.
It was a young marriage.
It was more or less over
when we lost Milly,
our daughter.
Shit. I'm sorry
to bring it up, mate.
No, don't be. You're not the one
that gave her leukemia, right?
Yeah.
She was 6 when she
couldn't fight any more.
So, uh...
I don't know, after that,
it was over. It was all done.
The only thing left
was the memory of
losing the most
beautiful thing...
on this Earth.
So, yeah.
This is why I seem
to drink myself to sleep
every fucking night.
'Cause if I don't, all I do
is see Milly's face
and every other piece
of heartache I caused.
So think about it, Frenchie.
Yeah. You got all this
to look forward to, huh?
Let's see if you
make it through today.
There she is.
She's got a tough
life, this one, eh?
You know, I
don't think there's enough
retail therapy in the world
to compensate
for living with Barbosa, but...
Yeah. Probably right.
So what's your
story, Frenchie?
Who says I've got one?
Well you're here,
ain't you?
I mean,
I've made a few mistakes.
Signed up for the service
back home.
Had the best of intentions.
Didn't quite pan out
that way.
I'm not the only one
who's suffered for it either.
Collateral damage, huh?
My specialty.
And so I
said, "He adores me."
This ain't Rodeo Drive,
Frenchie.
What's she doing
this far east?
I don't know, mate,
but she doesn't look too happy.
So screw you,
you Irish prick!
This could be good for us.
Too good for you anyways.
Fucking asshole.
Yeah, yeah.
Way too fucking good for you.
Do you know who the fuck I am?
I'm the best you'll ever get.
Fuck you.
I'm done with you anyways!
What the fuck are you
doing here?
- We're making sure you're okay.
- I'm fine. Now get lost.
- Come here, you fucking...
- Get your hands off me.
Know what my fiancé will do
when he finds out about this?
- Don't leave the part out about being outside@@
- Connor'.
What? You talk to his bitch ex?
The Chinese wannabe artist?
- You got nowhere to run.
- Should've never got off the bus.
I'll tell you what.
You got two choices:
You can either get back on
that bus or marry Barbosa.
This Connor kid
isn't for you.
Come to think of it,
maybe he's always been that
little bit too good for you.
Piss off, Grandpa.
And as if I'd need
to take the bus.
I drive a Maserati.
I think you're missing the point
on the bus line, love.
So you tracked him down.
My fiancé will be pleased
with his minions.
Apartment 610.
Knock yourselves out.
And send him my love.
Six-ten.
- Ooh!
- There you go, my love.
- Thank you.
- After you.
Yes, thank you, honey.
My pleasure.
Elevator's over here.
No, no. No elevators,
Frenchie.
I don't do elevators.
Let's take the stairs.
- You sure you can handle it?
- Yeah, I can handle it.
Who are you?
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I know what you...
Fuck.
Please wait. Wait a minute.
- I know what you want.
- Stay there.
I know what you want.
Listen, this can't happen here.
This can't happen here.
Please, for chrissake.
Let's go outside.
- You know why we're here, right?
- Yeah.
Amanda's blowing up
the intercom, isn't she?
Oh, hey, sweetheart.
Hey, come here. It's okay.
Daddy's just playing
with his friends, okay?
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.
What's going on?
Who are these men, Daddy?
They're just...
These are Daddy's friends, okay?
We're just having
a little chat.
Lainie, look at me.
Look at Daddy.
I need you to go back
into your room and play, okay?
Okay, but, hey,
sweetheart...
we're just playing
grown-up games here, okay?
It's a very fun game, Lainie.
You wanna play?
Come on. Everybody
get on their knees, yeah?
I'll tell you how it works.
We all hold hands in a group.
We close our eyes, and then
we count and somebody hides.
Can you sit the fu...?
Can you please sit down,
Mr. French?
There you go.
You know what?
That means that
it's your turn to hide, Lainie.
- How long do I get?
- We're gonna count to 50.
Then we'll all
come look for you.
So make sure you find
somewhere good to hide.
Wait a minute.
What is that?
What?
Oh, right here. Ooh!
Wow! Where did that
come from?
- Huh?
- It's magic, sweetheart, okay?
Now, listen,
go inside and hide.
It is magic, sweetheart.
Go ahead. You take that.
We're gonna look for you
in just a little bit.
That's one, two...
three...
four...
Let's get something straight.
Do you understand
that you can't run forever?
I'm not running. I'm just trying
to move on with my life.
- With my daughter.
- So where's her mum?
- She passed away.
- That's touching.
How do you get yourself
into this mess?
How do you have a man like
Barbosa hunting you?
I ran some clubs
back in Dublin.
And then
when I got over here,
I got a job in one
of Barbosa's clubs.
I came with ideas, man. I...
Move. Tell me more. What?
Long story short,
I fell in love with one
of Barbosa's club dancers.
Crystal.
She was perfect, man.
She was perfect
for me anyway.
But the problem was
that Barbosa,
he's a possessive prick,
isn't he?
He hated the fact that she
fell for me instead of him.
Crystal was pregnant.
And when he found out,
he beat the shit out of her.
He even stabbed her.
Yeah. Can you believe that?
That fucking snake
stabbed a pregnant girl.
Lainie,
she arrived way too early.
She was in the ICU
for ages.
Crystal...
Sh-She never made it
out of hospital.
She died shortly
after the birth.
Where does Amanda
fit into all of this?
She just wanted
to take a bite
out of the forbidden fruit,
I guess.
I don't know.
She's the one
that told Barbosa.
And that's what sparked
this psychotic rage, and...
now here we are.
Look, listen to me.
Listen to me.
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please.
For my daughter's sake.
Sue.
All right, all right.
- Listen to me. Yeah?
- Yeah.
You're gonna leave town,
all right?
You never set foot back in L.A.
again? Understand me?
- I swear.
- Yeah?
Slow down.
This is not your position
to make this call, Frenchie.
- Don't go down there.
- If what he's saying is true...
- You don't have the authority.
- If what he's saying is true,
and we give in to Barbosa,
we are a couple of massive
fucking wankers. Aren't we?
What about the kid?
If we let you go...
you go right now.
Thank you. Thank you.
I understand.
Don't thank us. We're fucking up
by letting you go.
You just save your
daughter.
- Okay?
- Okay.
Come out, come out,
wherever are.
Wherever you are
can't be far.
You walk a line
you never cross.
It's the line
between being respectable...
businesslike...
and being an all-out
amoral motherfucker.
And if you get soft...
it's over.
That was the
right thing to do, Sue.
You know that, right?
Fuck you, Frenchie.
Fuck you.
What do you think Tommy's
gonna do when he finds out?
Huh?
Amanda saw us come in.
She's gonna rat on us.
Fuck you.
Yeah, well, at least
I can live with myself.
Maybe for not too much longer,
you dumb son of a bitch.
I should get
my fucking head examined,
listening to you.
Might be nice though, eh?
To be able to look at yourself
in the mirror for once
and not feel disgusted?
She was the same age as Milly.
You know, Frenchie?
I couldn't do it.
Couldn't do it. I couldn't...
I couldn't have her see us
beat up on her old man.
I just couldn't do it.
What are you doing here, Amanda?
You really should go home.
What are you doing?
Where's Connor?
He wasn't in.
The fuck he wasn't!
I spoke to him.
You didn't. That
wasn't his voice.
I think I know the sound
of his Irish accent
when I hear it.
Besides, none of that matters.
Barbosa's here.
He set you up, assholes.
They're here to kill Connor
and blame it on you two.
They've already gone up
in the elevator.
You're happy
about that, are you?
You fucking bitch.
You're gonna fucking
set us up for this?
She's gonna fucking
set us up for this,
you fucking bitch!
I can't fucking
believe this.
- What do you think we should do?
- I don't know, freshman.
I've never really been
in this situation
till you come along.
We could call Tommy,
gather the boys.
Let them know
what Barbosa's up to
and wipe out
the whole fucking bloodline.
Yeah?
What about the kid?
They got
fucking guns, Frenchie.
They got fucking guns.
No, no, no.
We can take these guys.
Listen, Sue, we can take them.
We can take them.
We hit them hard, hit them fast.
I take the weapon,
I fire shots over the rest,
the rest will shit themselves.
We get Connor and the kid,
then get the fuck out of here.
We can do this, mate.
- Okay, sure.
- Yeah?
Come on. Okay, kid.
Hey, Sue. We worked together
well this weekend, mate.
But I don't think I'll be
coming to work on Monday.
This is, by far,
the shittiest job
I've ever had
in my fucking life.
Well I wish I had your wisdom
20 years ago, kid.
Shall we?
- Alex?
- French.
I warned you.
It's a dog-eat-dog business.
Go.
Connor, open the door!
- Get in there! Get in!
- Move.
Lainie, come here.
Come here, baby.
- Is there another way out?
- Through there.
Fire escape
through Lainie's room.
It'll take you
to the lobby.
Take you downstairs.
Take her and go now. Go.
Sue.
Sue, get behind something.
Aah!
Yeah!
Fuck.
Good job.
Sue...
you're not half the man Tommy
thought that you were, huh?
Look at that, man.
You should've walked away.
Had to settle
for a knockout.
Golden Boy.
Tommy.
Your boys, man.
They set it off.
It was a bloodbath.
I tried to stop 'em.
It's why I called you.
- My boys did this?
- Yeah.
Well, like Sue
always said...
there will always be
a bigger, badder cat
just waiting to take
you down.
Tommy...
we got history.
Ah, you piece of shit.
You think I don't know
you set us up?
Did you really think
you can kill a man
like Sulinski
"Golden Boy" Baker
and just walk away?
Not after all the years
he walked the line for me.
Upstairs.
Get SWAT on the radio.
You two, on my six.
I need SWAT over here
on 5610 Eastside. Over and out.
Here we go.
- Thanks very much.
- Of course.
- This looks lovely.
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Anything else I can get for you?
- That's it. Thank you.
Let me cut it up
for you now, okay?
Don't need you choking
after all that.
Make sure you have
some of your spinach with it.
It tastes delicious.
All right?
Do cows have a good life
before they get
turned into steak, Daddy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course, they do, sweetheart.
Yeah, cows get to do
all the fun things
that cows love doing.
You know? Like, um...
Like eating daisies and, uh,
roll around in the grass.
Just like you.
Then, you know,
the farmer does come along.
He looks the cow in the eye,
and he says:
"Barbecue time!"
Yeah.
I'm glad they have
a fun life, Daddy.
Yeah, me too, sweetheart.
Me too.
Eat your dinner.
