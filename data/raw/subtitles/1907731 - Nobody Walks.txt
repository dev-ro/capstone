(jet approaching )
( man speaking over radio)
( chuckles )
(car alarm chirps)
(girl clears throat)
Listen. Um...
I had a great time
sitting next to you on the plane.
Silver Lake, right?
( Pop music playing )
Girl:
"Every morning as I drive away
I am reaching back for you.
It is a helpless feeling,
this wishing, this wanting,
this knowing you will arrive
just minutes after I have gone."
Well, I thought that
was really freakin' good.
Teacher: All right.
All in favor of including this piece
in our spring issue, raise your hand.
Nearly unanimous.
And our author-- Kolt.
Sylvia Plath would be proud.
Congratulations.
( Exhales sharply )
Thanks, dude.
- Hi.
- Hey.
- Um, hello. I'm Martine.
- Hello.
- Hey. Hi. ( chuckles)
- I'm Peter.
- Let me grab this for you. Come on in.
- Thanks.
Julie can't wait to meet you.
What's making you feel so powerless?
I'm way too afraid
to even approach a woman
that might be on my intellectual level.
I know what you're gonna say.
It's not 'cause
I'm afraid she'll reject me.
I'm afraid I'll reject her.
Okay. Why is that?
You know, a lot of smart women
think too much to look good
and talk too much to fuck well.
I feel like such an asshole saying
these things to a woman.
I do get what you're saying, actually.
'Cause the movie
comes out this week,
everyone's acting like I'm supposed
to be excited, but I fucking hate it.
And I wish I could say it looks nothing
like the script I handed them...
but they didn't change
a goddamn line.
I just wrote something
that isn't very good.
We're gonna need to stop.
( Groans )
Don't do this to me, Julie.
I will see you on Wednesday.
( Silent )
There's a lot of life
that'll come out with the sound.
There's-- you know,
like the bug's footsteps
or maybe his breath.
You know, what would it sound like
if you could hear the bug's heartbeat?
Or, like, heartache.
What would that sound like?
- ( Chuckles )
- You know?
Peter: Yeah.
All right.
I think this'll be fun.
Martinez
Yeah. I'm really excited.
Thank you so much for putting aside time
to do this with me.
- Absolutely.
- So you're working on, like,
a big studio movie right now?
I am, yeah.
They're not picture-locked yet.
So you're in luck.
Hey, Peter, is this
a take-from-the-fruit-bowl night?
Martine, this is Kolt.
Kolt, Martine.
- Martinez Hi.
- Hey.
What is
a take-from-the-fruit-bowl night?
Oh, it just means that
everyone's on their own for dinner.
Nobody's taken
responsibility as of yet.
( Chuckles )
Peter:
That's a maybe?
- Hey, David.
- Oh hey, Kolt.
HEY-
I'm just getting out of here.
Crazy plans?
David:
Just finishing up some things for Peter.
How about you?
Lots of homework?
Not really. I already did
this history thing that's due Friday.
Well, it's good not to procrastinate.
(chuckles ) Yeah.
I do anyway sometimes though.
Procrastinate.
Oh yeah, of course.
I'm giving you advice I can't take, so--
( Kolt chuckles )
- Eating bark in a tree.
- Peter: Slow or fast?
Fast.
Wind, and also sand
blowing in the wind.
Sounds that only ants hear.
Ah, need to be more specific.
- You know what? We'll come back to it.
- Okay, gasping.
Sticky stuff.
Bowling pins.
Blood on pavement.
- Got it.
- Really?
Hey, come on.
An old train.
Okay, um, bodies rubbing
up against each other.
Okay. So people having sex?
Yes. But not like--
( grunts )
Okay. Good to know.
( Chuckles )
( crickets chirping )
( door opens, closes )
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, bud.
- Hey.
- Hi.
Julie:
Is she coming to eat? Where is she?
- Jet lag.
- Is it gonna work out?
I think so, yeah.
She's really sweet.
- Good.
- I think she's really talented too.
Hey, who is in the pool house?
Her name is Martine
and she is a friend
of my friend Miriam's,
and she needed Daddy's help.
- Hey, guess what.
- What?
My poem got into lit mag.
Julie:
Sweetness, that's fantastic.
- Did you call your dad?
- Not yet.
Well, you know, he wrote poems
before he wrote songs.
And maybe one day he will publish
some of those poems,
and he can buy us a hot tub.
( Camera shutter clicking )
(sighs)
(phone ringing)
- Julie: Wanna get that?
- Huh-uh, no.
- You sure?
- Yeah. One of the kids will get it.
No, they won't.
They always let it go to the machine.
And you never check the machine.
-( Ringing continues)
- Wait. I'm coming, I'm coming.
Hello?
- Hey, Avi.
- ( chuckles )
No, I don't know where Sea Horse is.
Hold on, let me check.
Koltl
It's Avi on line one.
I don't want to talk to Avi, Peter.
Okay, why don't you
tell him that yourself?
-( Beeps )
- Firm hand of a parent.
- Julie: Oh, so good.
- ( snaps fingers ) Nailed it.
Get the arm in there.
- Julie: I gotta wash my face.
- What?
- I have to wash my face.
- All right, the TV's going back on.
Them's the rules.
- ( Crowd cheering on TV)
- ( sneakers squeaking )
(announcer speaks)
( snapping)
( snapping echoing )
( Martine breathes deeply )
(squishing )
(squishing echoing )
( popping, rustling )
(echoing )
( echoing intensifies,
crackling )
(mimicking popping I
( echoes, distorted )
( hisses, bubbling )
(distorted bubbling )
( distorted )
(deep rhythmic thumping )
( intensified )
(school bell rings)
Hey, where you going?
Class is that way.
Oh, I'm not going.
You want a section?
I don't read Science, Finance or Sports.
Yeah, I'll take Science.
So, um, how's it going with David?
Hmm?
Oh. Um, it's complicated.
I mean,
there's definitely chemistry, you know?
But the age difference.
And he works for Peter, so--
I think we're both just...
a little afraid of where
it could go, you know?
Well, it's good to be cautious.
You have plenty of time.
We're only, you know, 16.
( chuckles )
( scoffs )
I hate it when people say that.
(water lapping )
( distorted )
I don't know.
What do you think?
Look, sir,
we don't need a pool cleaning.
The pool is clean.
- I'm looking at it right now.
- David.
( Scoffs )
No, you know what?
Just forget it.
You're crooks anyway.
My assistant.
He's a good guy.
Dusty's been upset
about this dead lizard
that's been clogging the drain
for like a week now,
and I don't think
the issue's worth $600.
Peter: This is our guest Martine.
She's the bug auteur.
- It's nice to meet you. Excuse me.
- ( water splashes )
I love that guy.
Every time we don't have
a big job going on,
he just tries to fix
what's broken in life.
My life.
Okay, what's next? Chimes?
(shower running )
And that is the power
of directional microphones.
They're kind of like magic wands.
Here, come on.
I want to show you something.
All right,
just lay down right here.
Keep the headphones on.
Close your eyes.
You tell me--
what do you think you're hearing?
- All right?
- Okay.
- ( Cars passing )
-( rhythmic noise)
I don't know.
That sounds like...
a concert, but far away.
It's the highway.
With those mountains in the back,
it echoes through the entire canyon.
- Wanna do another one?
- Yeah.
Close your eyes.
Okay, what about this one?
(rubbing lightly)
That sounds like wind
going through trees.
I'll buy that.
Okay.
Tell me what you hear...
HOW.
( Chuckles )
- ( birds chirping)
- ( man speaking Italian )
But what kind?
( Scoffs )
I'm tired.
( Man speaks Italian )
(correcting Italian )
David:
Hey, buddy.
Hey!
Ah, you looking to brawl?
You're Julie. Wow!
- Can I hug you?
- Yeah,
let's hug. I'm pro-hug.
I can't believe it.
I'm meeting you--
one of the original members
of Miriam's postfeminist wolf pack.
I've seen pictures of you guys, like,
sitting around swimming pools
looking focused.
It-it seems like it was an amazing time.
- I don't know.
- Buonasera.
- Peter: Ciao, guys.
- Hey, Kolt.
Hi.
Hi. I really like yourjeans.
- Thanks.
- Do they have zippers on them?
Um, yeah, they--
they do.
- ( Chuckles )
- Hey, you want to take off?
Martinez
Uh, yeah, we should.
He's taking me
to my friend's art opening.
Yeah, I-I can't drive.
I'm a New Yorker.
( laughs )
I'm clinging to that as my excuse.
- Can you drive?
- No.
No, not yet.
But we will be practicing very soon.
- Yes, we will.
- Okay.
- You hungry, Sea Horse?
- Not really.
Peter:
Hey, remember: 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,
- actors.
- Yes. I will be there.
And, Julie, I'm sorry that
we didn't get a chance to talk.
- Oh, we will.
- Okay.
Julie, is it possible to get my check?
Yes. I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back.
(car engine starts)
( scoffs )
There is a mammal that lays eggs.
Platypus, Avi! Platypus.
I gotta go.
( breathing deeply )
( crickets chirping )
( car approaches )
(gearshift clicks)
- ( engine stops)
- ( Martine exhales deeply )
Thank you for coming with me tonight.
No, thank you for bringing me.
Um...
I don't think
that I should do this right now.
Okay.
I just-- I just got here.
And I'm here to work.
And I think it's smarter
to forgo this type of--
Anyway, this was really nice.
Really nice.
( Both breathing heavily )
( heavy breathing continues)
( car door closes )
( bangs )
- Ah!
- ( Cellphone ringing )
- Ah. ( hisses)
Mmm.
(sighs)
- Martine, you're alive.
- Doug. Hey.
- Am lwaking you up?
- Um-- God, no.
I've been awake
for a couple hours already.
- Everything going all right?
- Yeah, it's going great.
( Doug speaks )
Um, I haven't seen it yet,
um...
but as soon as I get my Internet,
- I'm gonna--
- ( Doug speaking )
No. No no no no.
Yeah, we'll definitely finish on time.
Okay.
All right. Talk to you later.
Okay.
Okay.
( Groans )
Hi. I'm--
I'm sorry I'm late. I, um--
I couldn't find
the dialogue that I wrote.
That's okay.
Let's, uh, make
a couple copies of this.
- Hi, I'm Martine.
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming, guys.
- Sure.
- Whoo. Okay.
Patient:
So the reviews are in.
Some great, some good,
a few really hostile ones, of course.
How are the reviews making you feel?
I don't want to talk about the reviews.
Okay.
I had a dream last night.
Another one about your grandmother?
No.
It was about you.
All right.
- Am I allowed to tell you about it?
- Of course.
Um, I was on set
in the house that we shot in--
that weird glass box in the Valley--
and David Strathaim was
eating cereal out of a megaphone.
( Chuckles )
I had a break. Something drew me
to one of the bedrooms.
I opened the door--
( clears throat )
You were lying on the carpet,
and, um, you were
all dressed up in full lingerie--
you know, lacy bra, a thong, stockings,
those things that you use
to clip your stockings to your panties.
- I don't remember what they're called.
- Garters.
I was excited.
I walked over,
started to touch you, softly at first.
And then... more.
You werejust ignoring me.
You were all dressed up
like you wanted to fuck,
but you were totally unresponsive.
( Clears throat)
So I started talking to you.
What were you saying?
I just said, "Hey, baby, I'm here.
We're not done shooting,
but they don't need me. Do you need me?"
You still didn't respond.
I started to get upset.
I was begging,
which is not really my style.
I took my pants off,
'cause I just..
I just needed you
to know that I was hard.
And I looked at you
and I said, "I love you."
And then we were fucking.
It was that easy.
Woman:
Psst. Come over here.
- Man: What?
- Woman: I found it.
- Man: Where?
- Right here on the ground.
- Man: Is it safe?
- It's... sticky.
Okay. Um, I liked that.
Um-- uh..
Ken.
Ken, yes.
Um, I'm sorry.
Um, I want something a little harder,
I think, like you're
a protective husband, um,
but you're a little bit scared?
You're talking about
when I'm asking the question?
Yes. Um, you're still soft and scared.
Um, a little less blatant.
Um, like-- like--
like you're really
asking the question.
But I'm asking the question
because I'm scared?
Right.
Um, but you're not, like...
sitting in your fear.
Um, I just mean, like, um,
y-your fear, um,
it doesn't hinder you.
Like, you fear,
yet you're motivated by your fear?
Ken: This is
what happened in the other scene.
We did the eight takes of that,
and I have no idea
what the difference is
between any of 'em.
Well, I think it's good
to just take adjustments.
I'm not an actor
who minds taking adjustments,
as long as a director
is actually saying something.
I mean, have you ever worked
with actors before?
'Cause it seems like
your thing's bugs.
She used to take naked photos
of her boyfriend.
I Googled you.
I think they're really beautiful.
Peter:
Listen, we really appreciate the help.
All right, you're gettin' paid.
Why don't you do what she says?
Ken:
You're barely covering my gas,
and she's not telling me to do anything.
(sighs)
( door opens, closes )
( Peter whispers )
I'm sorry about that.
Martine: I'm sorry.
( Martine sighs)
You all right?
Martinez
Okay, I'm not even that upset right now.
It's just like...
I'm sorry, Peter. ( sighs )
I really didn't want that to happen.
What are you talking about?
You didn't do anything wrong.
That guy just didn't get it.
( Groans )
Ugh.
(sighs)
HEY-
Hey. Are you all right?
Is there something else goin' on?
(chuckles)
Then don't be so hard on yourself.
- ( Exhales ) Thank you.
- ( chuckles )
( clatters )
I heard something.
Did you hear something?
I think someone's outside.
It's David.
Okay, um,
I should--
I should go.
- I'm sorry.
- No. No no no. It's no trouble.
I don't even know
why you're wasting your time on this.
I want to help. It's, uh--
I think you're really someone who's,
uh, worth helping, so--
okay.
( Clears throat )
Hey, brother.
Hey, man.
Julie: Hey.
Are you a free set of hands?
Um, yeah.
I'm a terrible cook though.
That's all right.
Just chop this parsley real quick,
- and then you can get back to work.
- Okay.
Julie:
Getting into it?
What?
Are you getting a lot of work done?
Oh yeah, totally.
Completely.
So much work, yeah.
You know, I just realized
I saw your work once.
At Miriam's.
You were staying there, I think.
Oh yeah.
She let me keep my, um,
stuff there
during the lawsuit.
The lawsuit because
your boyfriend didn't want
to be photographed?
Um, well, I guess he felt
that I manipulated him
into posing naked.
- Ouch.
- Yeah.
It was not awesome, no.
Um, but I learned a lot.
We don't have to talk about this.
So you used to live in New York?
I did, yeah.
Where do you live?
I used to live in Hell's Kitchen
with my ex-boyfriend,
um, but I'm in Brooklyn now
with roommates.
- Two roommates.
- What are you, 23?
23...
I was going to CalArts.
Sort of.
Why sort of?
Because my main gig
was being a girlfriend...
to Leroy,
who you will meet tonight.
It's not a career I'd recommend.
It only took me...
I don't know,
20 years to get my life together.
Just keep doing what you're doing.
All right, flee.
You're free.
Are you sure you don't
need more help?
No, this looks good.
I'll see you at 7:00.
Okay.
Peter: When did you find out
you were gluten intolerant?
Man:
I was with, uh, Rod Stewart.
He was, like, having
a dinner party or something.
He was talking about,
you know, this whole gluten thing.
I was like, "Well, tell me,
you know, what is gluten?"
'Cause nobody really
knows what gluten--
- Julie: I know what it is
- Some-- I don't know.
I don't know.
Okay, I'm in the bathroom, right?
- And this was, like--
- Do you even know
who Peter Frampton is?
These guys don't even know
who Peter Frampton is.
- Man: You know Peter Frampton.
- Julie: I know who Peter Frampton is.
Man: But he doesn't know.
You never heard of Peter Frampton.
No, I've never heard of Peter Frampton.
But enough-- enough about me.
It's not about me tonight.
To Julie.
- For giving me something--
- ( scoffs )
No. For giving me
something like home.
Thank you.
- Do you still live in a bus?
- Man: Sometimes, dude.
But hopefully not again this year.
I'm so sick of the road.
(clears throat) I'd like to say
thank you to Julie and Peter as well.
- I feel very lucky.
- Oh, it's our pleasure.
You're very welcome.
- Julie, you look beautiful.
- Mmm.
No, seriously. I mean, you look about
the same age as our daughter.
-( Leroy chuckles )
- I don't, but thank you.
But you got this big guy over here, huh?
Mr. Handsome.
( Leroy chuckling )
So, Peter, um,
I hear that your mixing board is
where my practice space used to be?
- Is that right?
- The room was already soundproofed.
I'm glad someone's
getting some use out of it.
- ( Chuckles )
Julie: Peter just got
- a huge studio movie.
- You're kidding.
So he's gonna be
working down in Hollywood.
- Is that right?
- Leroy: Amazing.
That's great, man.
That's totally great.
So, Martine...
what do you make?
- What's the inquisition?
- I just want to know. What do you make?
Right now, it's, um--
it's images of bugs.
- Bugs?
- A film, actually.
Peter is helping me with the sound.
When's your movie come out?
It-- it actually
doesn't really come out.
It's gonna be running on a loop
at her first solo show.
A loop?
Peter:
Which is at a gallery.
It's a big deal.
Martine:
I don't know about big,
but it's some kind of deal, I guess.
Peter:
Come on, give him the spiel.
It's so much fun to hear
you talk about it. Come on.
Oh, I don't know.
You've got a great thesis statement.
Leroy would appreciate it.
It's basically, uh,
humans versus nature,
and, uh, the personal
versus the...
sort of intricate
complexities of community.
Listen, at the end of it
what you take away from it is--
What is that E.E. Cummings line?
You can understand a poem
without knowing what it means.
( Chuckles )
You shouldn't talk about work
around the table anyway.
I learned that the hard way.
( Exhales sharply )
Uh, excuse me for a second.
So, baby girl,
your mom tells me that, uh,
you had a poem accepted
to a literary magazine.
- Two actually, yeah.
- Leroy: Two-- wow.
Beautiful and smart, huh?
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Leroy:
Tell me, tell me. That's amazing.
Koltz
Yeah, I don't know.
I didn't think they were
gonna like both of them.
( Knocks on door)
Martine:
Just a second.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You don't sound fine.
- ( toilet flushes )
Leroy:
I remember once I was opening for Wilco
and I couldn't remember a line.
I sang, like, three songs-
I was just making up the words.
I swear to God, it was awful.
- Yeah.
- Peter: She's okay.
What happened? I thought maybe
I offended you or something.
No. I'm sorry.
Um, I'm impossible to offend.
I just, uh...
the tempeh was so good,
I-- I forgot I'm allergic to it.
( Chuckles )
Well, good. I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Hey, I have a question.
- Julie: Mm-hmm.
- Is Leroy ever gonna stop wearing
ﬂannel shirts and Doc Martens?
I mean, the guy's like
a cartoon character.
Or like an Amish person.
One outfit? Really?
I mean, he does have the money
to get like a variety of apparel.
I think the only reason
why I'm asking is
I think I was legitimately confused
at dinner as to what year it was.
So you wanna talk about dinner?
What?
You wanna talk about
your little crush on our houseguest?
Excuse me?
- What? Did you not hear me?
- No, I definitely heard you.
What are you talking about?
What do you have an issue with?
I don't have an issue
when you bring
your ex-husband over
and make googly eyes
at him all night.
Give me a break.
We have a child together.
What difference does that make?
I understand you're attracted to her.
She's attractive.
I'm fucking attracted to her.
Okay. What-- what are we talking about?
(Julie sighs)
Just don't embarrass me.
( Soft chittering )
- ( snaps )
. ( beeps )
- ( echoing )
- Martine: ltjust sounds really canned.
- Canned?
- Yeah, like flat.
- ( Button clicks)
- Ear fatigue.
It's an actual phenomenon.
Afﬂicts many.
I think your ears are tired.
I think it's the echo.
Can we just take it out?
I think we need a break.
I think we need
to finish this scene.
Honestly, I think if we come back to it
with fresh ears, it'll be better.
Peter, we really need to,
like, get through this.
Come on.
Okay.
- ( Exhales )
- ( button clicks)
( rustling, chittering )
- ( button clicks)
- ( playback stops )
- Listen, about, um...
- Yeah.
...the other day
in the pool house--
Look, I'm really sorry.
_ l__
- No no, I, um--
I find you incredibly charming
and intelligent and beautiful.
I respect what you do.
It makes me excited
about what I do.
And I think I just got, uh--
just carried away
in that mix of, uh, feelings.
Peter, it doesn't have to be a big deal.
We can just pretend
it never happened and--
Marriage is complicated.
I think we should just
keep working on this right now.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
( chuckles )
- ( clears throat )
- ( button clicks)
( rustling )
-( rustling stops )
' ( Scoffs )
I'm sorry.
Your physical presence
this close to me is actually painful.
( Both chuckle)
This house is, like, full of people.
Don't worry about it.
This room is completely soundproofed.
( Martine moaning )
( birds chirping )
Vroom!
( Martine moaning )
- ( thumping )
- ( both moaning )
( water spraying )
(tutor speaking Italian )
- "Panino"?
- Mmm.
I don't know how to say it.
( Tutor sighs )
Hmm.
It's called a slip.
( Crickets chirping )
- Peter: Are you ready for bed?
- Julie: Where's my cookie?
- ( Peter chuckles ) What cookie?
- You ate the last cookie?
- Peter: No, there are no cookies left.
- ( both chuckle)
- Julie: You suck.
- Are you coming to bed
or are you gonna keep reading?
- Julie: I'm gonna keep reading.
- All right.
My breath just happens
to smell like chocolate...
chip cookies.
- Mmm.
- Oh, have more.
Do you like Avi?
Well, yeah.
I do.
I think he's really sweet.
Do you like Avi?
I don't know.
I mean, he's certainly not like
- my fantasy boyfriend or anything.
- Yeah.
Wow. Your dad
seemed like
the fantasy boyfriend.
But he wasn't.
No, he wasn't.
So then
how do you know when
you've found the right guy?
I don't know that you do know.
I think you're just--
you're ready...
and you pick one.
That's really depressing, Mom.
No, I don't think it's depressing. I-l--
I think-.
I think people change and, uh...
and you keep changing
and you make a decision
to change together or...
you split up.
Um...
see you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Sleep well.
(sighs)
Hi.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Can I swim with you?
I think you need to have
a grown-up as a lifeguard.
You're a grown-up.
Um, well, that's a good point.
I'm just-- I'm not very--
anyway, let's get you
back to bed, okay?
I won't splash anymore.
I promise.
Can you take me back to my room?
. Um__
- It's dark.
L-- I don't want to wake
your parents up.
We can walk on tippy-toes.
Okay.
Man.
These stickers--
I had stickers like that
when I was your age,
except I also had
birds and bees and stuff.
They only had outer space stuff
at the Creativity Store.
Well, it's looking good in here.
Mmm.
Okay.
Okay.
Good night.
( Synthesizer notes echoing )
So we can listen
to what he's doing on the synth
with the ambient sounds
already in if you want.
Yeah, that would be super helpful.
( Note warbling )
It seems like he wants
to play on the synth
more than actually work on the film.
We'll make it good.
Don't worry.
( Notes continuing )
Hey, David, do you want
to run to the store
and pick up that squishy food
for the Foley?
I just want to finish
before the party tonight.
Uh, you don't want to finish this first?
That's okay.
I think Martine can run the board.
Copy that.
Uh, back in 20.
( Notes continue)
( door opens )
( door closes )
I don't know how to work the board.
It'll be fine.
Just hit the space bar,
come back here
and watch it with me.
Okay.
- ( Note echoes)
- ( strikes key )
Ready?
( Notes playing )
( rustling )
(squishing sounds)
(clicking sounds)
I think I want synth
in the whole movie.
(sound effects continue)
Julie:
Okay, David, you can take Martine.
The kids can ride together.
- Great.
- Peter: Oh, okay.
- You know where you're going?
- David: Yeah.
( Rock music playing )
( people chattering )
(couple laughing )
Woman:
There you go. Get some more.
No.
( chuckles )
( coughs )
No, that's all part of it.
( coughs )
It works better when you cough.
You guys don't know that?
( '60s pop music playing )
J'SunJ'
J' Lying in the sun J'
J' Had a lot of rain in the winter J'
J' All I want is the sun J'
J' Doesn't everyone J'
J' Have a little pain
from time to time? J'
- It's the inevitable run-in.
- Inevitable?
Well, it's a small town-- at least
the parts of it that we inhabit.
Gosh.
You look amazing.
Thank you.
- It's good to see you.
- Are you a friend of Rosa's?
You're not allowed to say?
Hmm.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
- Ha ha, very funny.
- Huh-uh.
I want to be alone with you.
Um...
I don't think that's a good idea.
Are you sure?
You look like you might.
- Might what?
- Want to be alone with me.
J'SunJ'
J' Lying in the sun J'
J' Had a lot of rain
in the winter J'
J' All I want is some
peace for a minute J'
J' All alone in the sun. J'
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.
My mom is stoned.
It's hilarious.
Let's get out of here.
( Pop music playing )
(man singing)
(sighs)
I need to tell you something.
Take a walk with me.
I can't.
I'll see you on Monday.
Take a walk with me.
You don't know
how crazy you make me.
Well, then I guess
I'm not doing my job, am I?
( Patient chuckles )
You're too witty to...
be a professional listener.
- I have to go find my daughter.
- Hmm-mm.
Just give me a minute of your time.
This has already gone too far.
( Mutters softly )
Drop your glass.
( Clatters )
( chattering )
If you moved here,
you could live on the Westside.
You can walk on the Westside.
I don't like the beach.
- Martine: Hey.
- Hey, what's up?
I gotta get out of here.
- David: Let's-- let's go.
- Okay.
Oh. I forgot my bag.
( Birds chirping )
( Martine chuckles)
- All right.
- David: All right.
- Martine: I'll see you inside.
- Yeah, I'll--
I'll see you soon.
( chuckles )
Hey, Peter.
L gotta go-
( door slams )
HEY-
What the fuck are you doing?
What the fuck are you doing?
What?
You want to fuck me up? Fine.
You were doing
a pretty damn good job of it
before you had
to go fuck my assistant.
Okay, whoa.
I'm not trying to fuck with you.
I'm-- I didn't mean for this to happen.
This whole time I was--
I was feeling something.
I was feeling like there was
some sort of connection between us,
but that was all bullshit.
I'm taking all my time
and I'm doing this for you,
and you go and you betrayed me.
Betrayed you?
- But, dude, you're married.
- That's right. I'm married!
With a family!
And now I have
to go figure out a way to fix this.
I'm just here trying to work
and you're all over me!
I'm just doing what I have to do
to get my shit done!
( Chuckles )
Take your files
and figure out a way
to fix your own movie.
(sighs)
(water hose running )
( bike clatters )
Fuck!
( Chittering )
( discordant synthesizer notes )
( beeping )
( multiple sounds playing )
-( Martine groans)
-( beeps )
- ( sounds stop)
-( Martine groans)
I want to learn to say
some more practical words.
I don't know.
- What's the word for "suitcase"?
- Suitcase?
Yeah, what's the word
for "suitcase"?
I'm not a poet.
Some poems.
Ah
No.
No.
' A"9l'Y poems.
' Angry poems.
In English.
"Sometimes there's a person
who you know looks right.
Their skin is fine, like a linen cloth,
and their hair is the color of night.
And they walk.
And when they walk,
that walk makes ladies
turn to their window
and admire.
All the ladies in the town,
with their secret things
that they want.
You were this man...
in the town from which you came.
But this--
this is not your town.
And when you speak,
your words are snakes
I swat at with swords.
They crawl into parts of me,
and I kill them
with kindness I can't afford.
I see you..
With the accurate eyes of the sun.
You think you're imprinting
yourself in my memory,
a man with the power to teach.
You will never have anything
or anyone you want,
least of all...
If I were to tell my mother
and the others,
we would laugh at you,
louder than we have all along."
( tutor speaking )
I don't understand.
You don't understand?
IBaSI:a[
- Who the fuck is this?
- IVamos! ( speaking Spanish )
That's Spanish. I'm Italian.
I don't give a shit. Get out.
( Spits )
( door opens )
( door closes )
( Martine exhales )
Are you okay?
I'm okay.
I don't know about that plant though.
( Chuckles )
I just don't want to have to explain it.
We can get that cleaned up
before anyone sees it.
My mom's gonna be so mad
I don't have a tutor anymore.
I provoked him...
with my angry poem.
Maybe he provoked you
into writing an angry poem.
I'm supposed to take
the Italian SAT too.
I didn't think
there was anyone in the house.
Yeah, I was just coming back
from a long walk.
A walk where?
I got down to Hyperion
and then I turned around and...
someone pulled over
because they thought I was a prostitute.
Maybe they just thought you were hot.
Well, not the way
that Italian fellow thinks you're hot.
- He throws things, he gets so excited.
-( both chuckle)
I want Martine gone by tomorrow.
I'm sure you understand
why we need to terminate.
Terminate?
I have a list of names,
qualified colleagues-
Oh God. Oh God.
What happened between us
was an incredible breach
of professionalism
and is not the way
I want to conduct myself.
Really?
Not even a little bit?
Kolt, come in.
The water's hot.
I don't really feel like getting wet.
Mom just blew up the purple raft.
You can go on that and not get wet.
(Dusty giggling)
(both giggling)
Kolt. Can we do a somersault?
Let's do it at the same time.
- One, two, three.
- ( splashes )
( sizzling )
It smells good in here.
Peter:
It's Dusty's favorite.
I'm leaving.
I'll call you a cab.
No, there's one on the way already.
Oh.
( Plate clinks)
I'll send your files in a few days.
( Pan clanks)
( silverware clinks )
I'm thinking of adding more synth.
I think it'll be good.
Thank you.
Peter:
All right, all right.
- Dusty: Oh. Let's--
- Peter: Who wants it?
Dusty:
Grilled cheese!
- Oh, I didn't know you wanted one
-( 9599551'
No, these are for me and Sea Horse.
No no no.
- Grilled cheese! Grilled cheese!
- No no, those aren't yours.
This isn't yours.
You go in here.
All right, fine.
You can have one.
- Dusty: Grilled cheese!
- Peter: This is mine. I want this one.
- How's the water?
- It's good. It's nice actually.
- Ooh, it's cold.
- It's not that bad.
( Dusty shouts )
- After all that hard work?
- ( 9i99l°§ )
Thanks for lunch, by the way.
-( Parking brake clicks)
- ( car door opens)
( car door closes )
HEY-
I'm, uh-- I'm heading out.
- Back to New York?
- Yeah, back tonight.
Thank you again
so much for everything.
You have a really amazing home.
Okay.
And if you ever come to New York
or if Kolt is interested in RISD--
This is probably the last you'll be
hearing from anybody in this family.
Good luck with your film.
