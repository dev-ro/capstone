How’ve you been?
Really? Okay!
I heard something!
That was during the last release.
Oh my God!
We catch up only at parties.
And we must work together!
Now you're talking!
Thank you!
Excuse me.
Hello!
-- Hello, Madam.
Hi!
-- Looking ravishing Neelu!
Hi.
Wow! Looking gorgeous!
What are you doing!
-- Oops! Sorry!
What are you doing
here? Come with me.
So the Queen Bee, slightly drunk,
stood there and said, ''Darling,
What are you doing
here? Come.''
So I'm Bimala?
-- I don't know that. But...
...I sure ain't Nikhilesh.
That's understood.
No matter how much you
invoke Brechtian alienation...
...ultimately you too are a
possessive, insecure man.
Come, I'll introduce
you to some people.
Tell me something... you
really like these parties eh?
Aren't you bored? The same
fake smiles and gossip.
How about poetry
or attending a play...
Then I'd miss out on talking to
Mr. Agarwal about the next film.
This is important.
Now get up. Come on.
Come on now!
Get up!
''Although Nikhilesh
avoided the argument,
but he understood
a serious fight was at hand.''
Stop it, will you!
It's pointless to invest
so much in such films.
I'm doing this only
because they feature in it.
Yes, obviously.
I'll try... I'll...
...try my level best to
get them on board.
The project is different.
We don't make experimental
films in Bengali that often.
I think they'll accept it.
You see, probably I'll get them.
it might take a little time.
That's the problem.
The crucial thing is
a proper schedule.
That's the main criterion.
See if you can
convince them.
Yes, I'll get
on with it.
And...
I'll take your leave today.
See you.
What is it?
At this hour!
Trina di... sorry...
had you fallen asleep?
Was just about to.
is everything okay?
Yes, everything is fine.
You see, Trina di...
...I met a producer
this morning.
Got a good offer...
-- Watched anything new lately?
-- No.
What's new? The world
is running on gimmicks.
including films.
Gradually they'll end up
belonging to only one class.
is Kolkata only about
the shopping malls and cafes?
Go ahead, make a film
on have-nots.
Foreign festivals will
lap it up.
Stop talking crap.
They are a different extreme.
Dependent on
oppressed exotica.
Chuck it.
Escapist populist
cinema is far better.
Those days are gone,
Dr. Faustus.
The rural audience
has turned to the idiot box.
And with your crusade of
changing urban folk culture...
No point being sarcastic,
buddy. This is an industry.
Commercial art form.
Whether it be the golden era...
or aluminium.
if the wheels of the
cine factory don't turn,
your award--winning films
would not exist.
Remember, it's the proletariat's piggy
bank that pays for our high--rises.
Yes,
recently multiplexes
have come up. But...
...you know what I think?
I think instead of being myopic...
...I'll make a biopic like you.
A hit director after all.
Rubbish.
Better go back to acting.
Why?
Because I made a potboiler
after assisting Satyajit Ray?
I didn't mean that!
See,
...direction requires a very
calm mind.
And you need a lot of positive
energy. See Diptya...
...you've become very bitter.
''No one's doing anything.
All are calculative.''
That's true!
-- Even me?
immensely!
Let's go to The Rooftop.
-- Why The Rooftop?
How about our good old
hang out?
Will you or won't you?
-- What about the food at home?
Bought the refrigerator
to store clothes, is it?
Err... Pandora's Box... that's the
name of the production house.
Yes. And there's this
industrialist... who's the owner.
And he wants to produce
a film.
But... he wants...
...it to be a collection
of four short films.
Doesn't work in
the Bengali market.
Many tried and failed.
Told him?
I did, you know.
But I met him and figured
that he is determined.
And he's insistent about a
couple of conditions as well.
Good film with a tight budget,
the other one?
No. He says the budget
is not a factor.
Artists, technicians, none will
get a chance to complain.
What! is he reliable
or a chit fund owner?
Enquired?
-- He has a fertiliser company.
Has a big construction business
apart from that. it's a big company.
That is not a problem.
And he said, we'll have
to help him with the distribution.
That can be done.
Anyway, I'm free these days.
So, what's the deal?
You and I, two each?
No, he wants these
four short films to be...
...made by directors
of different genres.
As in, we make up
four different stories,
then we narrate them to him.
Then the decision will be made.
Okay.
Who are these four directors?
You.
I.
Shakya da.
Fourth?
Diptya da.
-- impossible.
Why?
Why impossible?
Can't attend a meeting with her.
No point creating trouble.
Come on!
Aren't you a professional?
Don't try to talk me into it.
I'm not game.
Joyobroto said it's a good
proposal. Let's go hear it?
You may like it too.
-- Joy's not a bad chap.
Mature. At least tries
to do good stuff.
The end result isn't that good.
But that's a different story.
So I couldn't refuse him directly,
somehow shrugged him off.
Go if you want to.
Don't drag me.
What film are you
making right now?
Shakya, don't provoke me.
Why turn down Rahul's father's
role? Such a good offer.
You call that a role?
Besides I've given up acting.
-- Think about your kid.
Tatha is doing his post doc...
-- So?
So nothing! Refusing one
offer after the other!
This is a huge problem with
ex--superstars like you.
Ex?
Come outside Post Box Kolkata
with me, you'll know.
Fine. But don't be adamant.
it's an interesting project.
And I hear there's a good budget.
-- Good budget... cool, I get it,
maybe an interesting project
too. But please Joy,
don't ask me to
work with that man.
As it is immense tension
at home regarding this. And...
Err... what I was saying...
Trina di... see...
...is there a point being angry
over some past episode?
You know very well that
my relationship with Diptya...
...is much more than
some past episode.
Yes, sure.
-- Then?
Which is why I was
saying that... err...
...What if you find out
he has changed?
Not a bit!
Very recently... last time when
I bumped into him at a party...
...sulked for hours
at a corner.
Nothing's changed! He's
exactly the same as before!
Okay... I promise...
You feel even a bit uncomfortable,
We won't take it up.
Just come for the meeting?
What's the point?
Avoided him all these years,
Why start all over again?
You know Trina di, I never
wanted to be an actor.
I'm compelled to act. I always
wanted to be a film maker.
So, along with my acting career
I've tried and made two films.
See, what happens is...
if this project happens...
...I find some ground beneath as
a director, as a film maker.
Working with people of
your stature,
you know?
See, I understand that this
is an unfair request...
But you're still going
ahead with it.
Yes.
Please.
Dad.
Dad, Mum's asking
you to get ready.
it's a weekday, there'll
be traffic. Quick.
Yes, I'll get going.
When was this taken?
So pretty! She was
something else, isn't it?
Oh yes!
You bet she was!
if I'm drooling over her,
I can imagine what
happened to you all.
Unlike you, we didn't fall in
love so easily back then.
Slow cooked the
feelings on low heat.
I don't fall in love so easily.
But I'm alert about the
pressure cooker.
By the way...
...is your script ready?
They've a very strict deadline.
Almost.
it's nearly done.
Dad!
Trust me.
Where's your mother?
in the kitchen. Don't change
the topic. what's the update?
Done with character and
plot introduction.
The real story
Will begin now.
Hello. Please come in.
-- Hello.
Ritwik...
Hello.
Have a seat.
-- Thank you.
Hope you found
your way easily?
No, that's alright.
Err... did you think about it?
Before that... tea of coffee?
No, thank you.
Just had lunch.
Okay...
-- About the project...
-- The project is very interesting.
-- Okay.
And we, in fact I, liked the
script a lot. isn't it, Ritwik?
Yes. Nice script.
The role is nice too.
interesting.
There's a bit of
a problem.
See, often what happens is,
the script is good but the
execution is not up to the mark.
Not because of the capability.
Maybe due to lack of experience.
So, we were thinking...
since this is your first film...
...We retain the story.
You produce it as well.
What if a friend of
ours directs it.
A friend of yours?
But my project...
Don't worry.
He's new but good.
Has been doing camera,
wants to make a film now.
Being a friend,
shares a rapport with us.
Asked him to come today.
-- in fact he'll be...
...there he is.
Well, sorry.
I'm a bit late.
Yes! Come!
we've just started.
Please come, Diptya da. Join us.
we've been waiting for you.
Please sit.
Since we've 'just' started, I think
you'd better give him the recap.
I'll have to leave
exactly by 1 pm.
Hello.
How are you?
Good. You?
-- Very bad.
Recap please?
You've heard some of it earlier...
...actually, Joy has got hold
of a producer.
He wants us to...
-- Name?
Rumpelstiltskin.
Happy?
Hear him out first!
-- Okay, sorry, go on.
The thing is he wants all four
of us to make four short films.
Yes.
The producer wants it to
be a collaborative project.
Who's this responsible alumni,
trying to arrange a re--union?
See?
What did I tell you?
Some people never change.
So much of negativity!
-- Excuse me!
Did you talk about negativity?
-- Chuck it now.
I bloody well did!
Will you guys stop!
Err... what's happening is...
we're digressing.
See, I'll summarise.
this Mr. Producer...
...his name is Mr. Gupta...
...he wants us to... rather
he's requesting all four of us to...
...Write four separate stories...
...and once the
stories are formed,
We go meet him and
pitch him the stories.
Once that is done we can
finalise the other details, like...
...casting, production design...--
Also tell him where we've to
go or he'll start grumbling!
Trina! Stop it!
-- it's true!
I'll tell you, you know Bak Khhali?
Near Frazerganj,
a little far away from Frazerganj
is this place called...
...Henry's island. Right! So the
producer has a bungalow there.
We've to go there
and pitch our stories.
Now, tell me what to do.
Tempting.
But I think we must enquire
about the producer a bit.
I've seen these kinds.
Once a producer had come...
..With a lot of money. wanted
to make Troy in Bengali.
Troy!
What!
interesting!
What was the cast?
I, Hector. Taposh, Achilles.
And Moon Moon, Helen.
Must've been a very
long time ago.
Otherwise, Hector,
with that physique...
if you can play a courtesan
with that accent then...
Enough!
Oh stop it you guys!
So where were we?
-- if you ask me, I think we should...
...take up the project.
we could.
Provided everybody cooperates.
Listen Trina, the project is
very interesting.
Besides it'll be a nice
excursion... right Diptya?
Yes, but...
-- Oh please!
You'll spend your life doubting!
Dialectics in everything!
You and your Marxism.
-- Marx is long dead, brother.
Even Nietzsche.
And God.
I forgot to mention...
...our producer has
only one condition.
All four stories must have
one common theme. And...
...that is...
...death.
Yes.
Death.
Bunked the rehearsal. Coming
back. what more do you want?
No, tell me what more
do you want?
Look Dad,
Why're you giving
me this bad trip?
How do I know where
the script is?
The keys were in the letter box.
Now how does weed
feature here?
Told you I don't know!
Why don't you ask that bitch?
Whatever!
Chuck it!
Four cups of tea!
Are the lights set?
Didn't you hear me?
Where's the tea?
What? is the shot ready?
-- Yes.
No... err..
-- What no?
Why are you stammering?
Shot?
No... I mean...
You must go there Sir.
I went to call her once.
But...
When are you back?
-- Why?
Want to party with those
buggers here?
Please Dad!
There are better places
to party than this hell hole.
Shut up! Leave if you don't like it
here. No one's stopped you!
My staying here disturbs your
philandering, isn't it?
Another word and you are...
-- What is it?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
What's all this!
Look what father and son
have done to the house!
Move.
Move!
-- Yes.
That's it then?
Done?
Problem solved? Now can
I get on with my life?
Go to hell!
-- That's where I am!
Chuck it, he's a kid.
-- No!
Hey! Listen!
You're crossing your limits!
No point closing the door!
This is my house!
I'll do anything I want!
Anyone can come here!
Anyone can go to my bedroom!
Should've stayed
with your mother.
Who'd roll for you?
Who'd teach you to paint?
Bloody ungrateful!
Hey!
Stop it!
Stop that noise!
Can you hear me?
Stop it!
The list I gave you...
...call them up and inform
that I'm not here for three days.
Everything is to be declined.
I'll be back on Friday.
Late night. Not a single
meeting over the weekend. Okay?
Okay Madam.
-- Got it?
Savita!
Savita!
Yes, Madam?
What? Why
did I call you?
Right, I'm off for three days.
Enough reserves?
Yes.
Ask Sir and cook
accordingly then.
Okay.
God!
I hate doing the menu!
The chicken?
Make that?
And something else, make
something with potatoes.
Okay.
-- And listen...
...no turmeric! it doesn't get off the
hand, you put so much of it!
Okay.
-- What is this? No gym?
I will. And you?
Can't make it today. I'm already late.
Need to take a bath and then leave.
I need to buy stuff.
Anondo... has Raghuveer come?
I'll call him.
-- Yes! He's always late!
Where to, tomorrow?
-- Err... Henry's island.
Some place near Bak-khali.
Who all are going?
Moloy, I thought I'd
explained everything to you!
What do you mean, 'who all'?
-- Just checking.
Don't! it irritates me!
You know very well, there's
only one reason I'm going.
And that's because I find
this project interesting, okay?
Really? is that
the only reason?
What exactly do you mean?
I've avoided working
with him all these years!
Not as an actor or a director. You
think opportunities didn't come by?
Now now! Do I smell
regret somewhere?
Moloy, if this is your way of
trying to make this marriage work...
...then I'm afraid I think
it's really weird.
I give up!
I swear I give up!
Hello.
She's leaving tomorrow.
Yes, she'll be
back after three days.
Listen, can we meet up
tomorrow?
Then we can go through
the plan once again.
So what's the plan?
See, the point is, the character
does not believe in gems....
...as in this particular
product at all.
But because his sister...
-- One minute.
Can we make this his brother
instead of his sister?
Sure.
Yes, so... his
brother convinces him?
So... the shooting dates?
-- Okay.
Yes, the dates... I'm not very
busy right now... so...
...just that I'm planning a feature, so
if we could decide the date on...
I have to take this call.
-- Sure.
Hello.
Hello... yes...
Yes, all arrangements
have been made. Don't worry.
We're leaving tomorrow
morning. Yes.
Don't worry, we leave
tomorrow morning. Yes.
An outing after a long
time, isn't it?
Feeling very nostalgic.
Here.
These are shooting stills
of 'when'.
No posters were made
for the film, right?
The film got canned.
Cheers!
Cheers!
You feel angry?
Why?
You know why.
-- Chuck it.
The film got canned
because of us.
Good it did. One of my
worst works.
Anyway, decided on a story yet?
No! will make something
up before the meeting.
And you?
I'm thinking of this script
I had written for a telefilm.
Name's 'Reunion'.
I'll sell that.
Then you're done. You're
going only on a holiday indeed.
Which is why
you're so excited!
So, what's your story about?
My story is about
a writer.
He writes serials.
He is particularly
famous for one thing.
A specialisation.
-- What kind?
Say an actor falls to give a
date or leaves the project,
or if they have a feud
with the producer...
...how then do they end
the actor's track?
By vanishing him or her.
By killing them.
Right. And that's his
specialisation.
He writes very good deaths.
-- is it so?
According to requirement.
According to the plot.
Highlighting the characters.
So a lot of his characters
get famous even by dying.
Nice.
A professional 'serial' killer.
You could say so!
Say...
...his name is Prodyumno.
Prodyumno da...
...Subroto da is calling you.
Okay, one second.
-- what is it?
'Prodyumno'... doesn't
it sound like a bomb blast?
Try something simpler.
Say... Pratik?
-- Please! Horrible!
Wait...
...Animesh! Okay?
Now let’s get back.
Yes, sorry, go on.
Animesh da...
...Subroto da is calling you.
Stand at ease! Attention!
Stand at ease!
Who are these people man!
Told you so many times!
Oh please! And don't talk
like that!
No matter what I say
you will talk normally!
And you, stand normally!
-- Yes, tell me.
Yes Sir, please come.
a  <font color="#ffff00">KHomeny007</font> - <font color="#00ff00">TUT</font> <font color="#ff0000">~ Presentation ~</font>
We're clicking funeral pictures.
How can the priest be missing?
Hey you, Abhijit,
you're always grinning!
Told you it's for a
funeral. Now smile!
What's going on?
None of these actors last
long in the serials.
Then you have to rack
your brains to kill them.
Then one can't find a photo for
the office, the funeral or home.
And production stills?
Let's not get there.
Hey you!
Miss Glitters!
Why're you being a Marilyn Monroe
Now? Be normal!
Normal!
Make it normal!
So the reason I called you,
We've to stop Anuradha's
track from our dally soap.
Have we established any
medical history of the character?
Medical history... no. Nothing
Was established in that sense.
But yes... she got a
headache in an episode.
She even got cranky.
Brain tumor?
That can't result in a
sudden death.
A heart attack or
a bus accident...
...okay wait, let me sit
on it tonight.
Two episodes are still pending.
A bus accident? That one's
nice. Good line of thought.
Bus is good. The way
they drive these days!
But in that case you've to be
careful with the color of blood.
Shouldn’t be like ketchup!
Listen, someone named Sonia
called. Said she'll call back!
Who's Sonia Now!
-- I should be asking that!
Come on, tell me.
What is it?
An affair at this age?
This is the ideal time for
midlife crisis.
I live with a whole life crisis,
midlife crisis is hardly scary.
What!
Listen, you!
Want a divorce? will
be too happy to oblige.
I just want a nice alimony.
-- Don't I know that darling?
Anyway, serve the dinner.
-- Come.
Have to stay up all night.
-- Come on.
Why did you kill me?
I killed you?
Who are you?
Why did you kill me?
I did not kill you.
Who are you?
Toton.
Who Toton?
Who is Toton?
Don't you know Toton,
Mr. Animesh?
What the hell is going on?
What's all this!
Who are you guys?
Strange!
Can't you
recognize your children!
My children?
What!
My daughter stays in Bangalore.
What are you trying to say?
Look at me carefully.
Rings a bell?
No?
No problem, I'll remind you.
Your first serial?
Surely you remember
the name?
That actress... what was her name...
Aparajita, she left suddenly!
Who's track got terminated?
Who's track got terminated?
Who had to hang herself?
-- Sonia!
Right!
Sonia!
-- Right!
I'll help you further. Your
third dally soap.
Same story there, the kid... he
left for America or something...
...Whatever. But who died of
cancer bit by bit because of that?
Why did you kill me?
-- No!
This can't happen! You
aren't human beings!
You're characters I've written!
And all of you...
-- Hey!
Baa...
Baadai, right?
Wow! You remember me!
You bloody intellectual!
Would you have killed me if I
was a cadre from the other party?
That's what the producer wanted!
I mean... during that time...
...and these things happen
during the elections.
Hey! Are you a writer
or a prostitute?
'The producer wanted'?
Listen, all of you
must understand this!
We need to deal with many
criteria... like TRP etc.
And what happened in Nandigram...
-- Very sad. But was I present there?
You buffoon!
Only helped the party with blood
donation camps and a bit of rigging.
And you got me
shot in a riot!
I killed people
from both the parties.
Shut up!
Don't talk crap!
The serial’s lead character
was from that party.
So the story had to...
-- Shove your story up your...
Because tonight, I'll
make a story out of you!
Hey! Please don't joke!
-- Baadai!
What are you doing!
-- One minute... Baadai!
Baadai, wait a minute. He killed
us with such pomp, right?
Then why shouldn’t we
do the same? isn't it?
Mr. Animesh, we'll put you
under a mock trial now.
What sort of a trial?
No! This is illegal!
illegal?
What illegal?
Killing people at the stroke of
your pen, sipping your coffee,
that's not illegal?
And playing God is?
Stop beating around the bush.
Let's kill him and tell Anuradha...
...she doesn't need to worry.
Animesh is finished.
No! Please hear me out!
I promise...
...Anuradha won't die.
Won't she?
-- No! I promise!
Won't she now!
-- I'll convince Subroto!
Late! Late! Late! Late!
Late!
Late!
Because we're here as the judge,
jury and executioner today.
And we must pass
the verdict today.
And the verdict is...
...Mr. Animesh, you're being
convicted for mass murder!
This is ridiculous!
No!
And the punishment
We've decided upon is...
...death!
-- Over!
You're not made of
fish and blood!
No?
You are all
fictional characters!
Fictional!
-- Fictional?
And who decides that? Do you
know you're fictional for us?
You! Know that?--
I?
Hey listen!
I have created you all!
My creation!
-- Creation? Are we now?
My creation! Please understand!
-- is it so?
Mr. Animesh, it is not so easy
to decide who created whom?
Even if I do believe you, I'd
have to say you're...
...guilty of infanticide!
Friends, how do we
kill this man?
How do we kill him?
No!
No!
Madhabi...
...Madhabi!
Madhabi!
Madhabi! You crazy bastards!
Open the door! Madhabi!
Where are you!
Let me put this through him?
-- No, cancer or AIDS.
Let him die bit by bit.
First he'll lose his hair.
Then his skin will fall off.
Then his face will go pale!
And then... poof!
Brilliant climax!
-- Err... how about a heart attack!
it'll be painless.
Our creator after all.
But...
-- Heart attack.
You are very
soft hearted.
Thought I'd play with
the writer a bit.
What is your problem?
My death was very painful.
Heart attack.
Final.
Please!
Madhabi!
Open the door!
Where are you guys!
High voltage drama.
He pens dally soaps, so the
melodrama is exaggerated.
But I'll try some
freaky lensing.
it lacks a bit of realism.
A horror film,
obviously unreal.
No, I'm not talking
about that realism.
I'm not saying I disliked
the unreal narrative.
in fact that's my favourite
premise. well adapted.
But I can sense
influences.
Pirandello, Rajshekhar Basu,
Woody Allen.
Oh no!
Now?
Don't worry.
it's only human to
be influenced.
Wow!
You sing quite well.
Then why were you hesitating?
What did I do?
Excuses like... you can't sing,
you've a sore throat... etc.
One must do those things. Or
people take you for granted.
Okay. So this is a secret
trick to gain accolades.
You could say so.
Can I say something else too?
Though that's a bit more...
...dangerous.
What?
You're a criminal and you want to
murder me for my money. Right?
No.
I want to speak to
your father.
I mean...
Hey...
till this line, right?
Cut it.
it's okay.
But we've to do it once more.
What exactly do you want?
-- You're perfect but...
..Nllanjana has to be
a bit less playful.
Much more restrained.
Much more controlled.
Remember, you've not started
your conjugal life, you're about to.
So there are inhibitions.
There's a wall.
The banter is definitely tangy.
But with a bit less emotion.
Then change the dialogue because
these lines are actually flirtatious.
The lines can't be changed.
The same lines can be
said in different ways.
Then again, sometimes saying
nothing at all says a lot too, right?
But...
-- What?
Nothing. I'm ready.
Let's go?
Buddy, please clean this table.
-- Called Mr. Gupta before leaving?
Yes, when we left. All
arrangements have been made.
Listen, excuse me.
-- Five star loos are rare here.
Thank God you told me!
Shakya da is very passionate
about his work, isn't it?
Protective too. Can
go to any extent.
Both of you from
Jadavpur University, right?
Yes.
He studied Economics,
I, Engineering.
And after that?
After university I
joined an ad agency.
Graphic artist.
And then group theatre.
A little acting here and there.
Got a break at
the movies.
And he joined a Film School.
Cinematography.
Later he wanted to
make a film.
I had gotten a bit
famous by then.
Got him a producer.
The film was a success.
After that we've worked
together a lot.
'Discovery', the first film?
-- No, before that...
-- Such a clean loo at a road side shack,
you won't believe till you see it.
Placed the order?
-- You guys go ahead.
I'll go check the
extremely clean loo.
Please go! it's a
must see!
Hello, Sir...
-- Yes.
Only clicking away!
Place the order.
Tell me what you want.
I'll tell them.
Okay, roti and dal
and some vegetables...
...I feel like some fried
lentils, will it be risky?
Why! I am in holiday mood.
Bring it on!
How can you not eat
fried lentils at a shack?
isn't it? So fried lentils,
roti and...
...you?
-- What will you eat?
Anything. Egg chow Mein...
Chow Mein? Chinese at a
road side shack? Too much!
Better not to have
all that here.
Half cooked noodles fried in
some cheap oil. Safe?
Then you... I mean,
you all... order something.
Excuse me.
I'll be back.
Take care of the camera. Don't
fiddle with it, I'll place the order.
He'll order Chinese
wherever he goes.
Hey Trina di, the loo is so
clean! it's shining!
I got a story idea in the loo.
-- what!
Say, two friends... they meet after
a long time at a shack like this.
Both go to the loo
to pee.
They play crisscross while
peeing, it's an old habit.
Joy!
-- Hey, listen!
while doing so their souls
get exchanged. interchanged.
But the problem is where
do I include death in this?
And the producer wants death.
-- Right.
I don't understand
one thing...
...why can't you just
stay by yourself?
Don't get involved in
everything. No!
Listen carefully!
I won't spend any more
money on you.
No way!
No way! You get
what I am saying?
I! I decide that!
What!
What did you say!
Where's Diptya? The
food's getting cold!
We're dying of hunger and
the man's busy on the phone!
Must be some trouble at home.
Anyway, how did you like
Shakya da's story?
Not bad.
But he has to be very
careful with the casting.
And the acting workshop.
Must,
very important.
Trina di, on a slightly
different note...
...I've to ask you something. You
don't feel uncomfortable, do you?
I know you've primarily
come here for me.
So far Diptya da is...
-- Not uncomfortable. But...
...I don't know if I should
even be asking this.
I've heard certain things
about Diptya.
Don't know if they're true.
Have you heard anything?
-- What?
That he's having an affair
with a girl half his age.
Yes, I've heard that too.
Don't know if it's true.
Midlife crisis and how!
After Shukla left,
he's totally lost it.
He is so restless!
How he wasted himself!
-- Why do you say 'wasted'?
What else? Such a great illustrator’s
son. A brilliant painter himself.
Left it all.
Was a good actor,
left that too.
Left TV anchoring, even the ad
agency and started with those...
...rotten, over--the--top
commercial films.
Acted in those as well!
When that wasn't
enough, took to alcohol.
Can you blame Shukla
for leaving him?
Who'll live with that alcoholic!
Drinking to death!
Why are you laughing?
Does he report to work on time?
Does he have a proper breakfast?
Does he carry a lunch box?
Or has lunch at the canteen?
Who washes his clothes?
Who makes him his
usual cup of tea?
And when does the maid come?
When does the maid come?
I'd have to wake up at dawn
Who's with him then?
Siblings? Parents?
No one was ever there
And now, he's
absolutely alone
And now, he's
absolutely alone
Who then, serves him dinner?
Who then, wakes him up?
Who lets him in at night?
Who then, goes through
all the hassle?
All arrangements done?
-- More or less.
She'll be back day after
or the next day.
We just can't afford
any slip ups.
Question doesn't arise!
We take proper
care of our clients.
How heavy is it?
I don't know exactly
but enough to kill a man.
Hey Diptya!
And another little thing.
I know.
You had told me.
Don't worry, it's on. we'll
get information any moment now.
Diptya... beware!
You scoundrel!
Bloody...
you bastard!
There, the phone.
Hey! Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
Get up!
Your glasses.
Here. Crossing the road
like an idiot!
What's wrong with you
again?
Fought at home?
Have been distracted
since morning.
Got it.
-- What?
The story.
Ready everyone?
I'll start then.
-- Okay.
My story's hero is
Mr. B. Dey.
Bedoshruti Dey. inhabited an
old house in the Bhowanipur area.
is the story set in present
times? Bedoshruti, the name...
it's back dated.
-- if you interrupt me...
Okay. Chuck it. Let's have some
chips. Does Mr. Dey like chips?
No.
He smokes.
Profusely.
Bedoshruti Dey lived in his
ancestral house at Bhowanipur.
He had rented out the
ground floor to a couple.
He was the owner.
Lived alone upstairs.
He had no one in his family.
A widower.
So he loved the tenant woman
living downstairs...
...like his own daughter.
Excuse me, I'm
interrupting you. Can I?
May I?
Yes, go ahead.
Could he have a white
cat as a pet?
Like you had for Miss Havisham?
-- That was a black one..
Great idea but.
-- I don't think so.
Very predictable.
I don't want to denote
loneliness with a white cat.
Rather,
a vacant bird stand.
A cockatoo’s stand.
Yes.
That will show the visual loss.
And...
...no hassles regarding
the Animal Board's permission.
People in his locality
thought Bedoshruti Dey was mad.
Though the reason
was weird.
Only one addiction, cigarette.
initially it was an addiction,
later became an obsession.
As in...
say one day...
what was that?
I didn't get you.
Why did you throw away
the cigarette?
What do you mean?
Smoked till the brand mark?
-- What!
The brand mark!
Crazy? who are you to tell
me if I'll smoke or not?
I'll tell you a hundred times!
A thousand times!
Know how many people
in the country...
...buy cigarettes with their
hard earned money?
They smoke the same
cigarette for days.
They smoke bidis at month end...
...to smoke cigarettes
throughout the month.
Which world do you live in?
-- That's enough now! Get lost!
Shut up!
Listen to me carefully!
in love with smokes eh?
Here, take your cigarette!
Come on! Hey! How
dare you hit me!
You'll hurt him!
Let go of him!
it was not so bad initially.
He lost his mind
after an incident.
Bedoshruti's world revolved
around one person.
She was everything
he had.
His newly wedded wife,
Bonolata.
They got married, back
in his village.
Bonolata died of a snake bite
on the wedding night itself.
Bedoshruti woke up to his
wife's blue corpse beside him.
That's it.
That was a shock.
Since then Bedoshruti
became kind of loony.
Used to read his wife's
letter day in and day out.
Didn't marry again.
Remained alone.
Only...
...that obsession with
the cigarettes...
...kept increasing
every day.
Err... actually, I was thinking...
I mean...
...is your husband home?
Yes, he's home.
But he is...
...he is a bit busy.
No, actually...
...it's an emergency.
So I came.
Emergency?
Are you alright?
Yes.
No...but...
Do you have a
cigarette on you?
Cigarette?
You've come to ask for...
-- Who is it so late in the night?
I told you he is busy...
-- Who is this bosom friend...
Oh.
The loony Grandpa.
Yes? So what do you need
so late in the night?
No, actually, he came for a...
-- Shut up!
Shut up.
Did I ask you?
a  <font color="#ffff00">KHomeny007</font> - <font color="#00ff00">TUT</font> <font color="#ff0000">~ Presentation ~</font>
Are you the 'loony Grandpa'?
Are you? Tell me!
Then who are you?
-- I was saying...
Sure, you'll say it later,
shut up now.
Shh! we're talking,
can't you see?
Yes. So...
So tell me.
What's your name?
What is your name!
-- Jyotsna!
Jyotsna.
Jyotsna. Give me
your full name!
Jyotsna Mukherjee.
-- Right!
Jyotsna Mukherjee. why are
you crying? Have I scolded you?
Have I hit you or scolded you?
What have I done?
Why are you crying then?
Jyotsna Mukherjee...
...Wife of Raj Kumar Mukherjee!
Always remember this.
Now go in.
You're done here.
Go in, come on.
Go.
So, loony Grandpa,
What do you want?
A cigarette?
You think I run a
cigarette shop?
I've a half smoked bidi,
want it?
want it?
Hello brother... listen!
Open your shop.
I need a cigarette.
No, Sir, it's closed.
Tomorrow morning again.
You don't get it!
I really need it!
Not possible now.
Come tomorrow morning.
Why can't you just open it once?
-- Sorry, Sir, tomorrow.
Not possible tonight. I've
to go home, I'm getting late.
And the police has
already started patrolling.
if they see the shop open,
there will be trouble.
Not possible Sir.
-- But I really need a smoke!
Told you, tomorrow morning!
Police!
What's going on here
at this hour?
Sir wants to buy cigarettes
but my shop is closed.
Okay, you can go.
-- Okay. Goodnight Sir.
What's your name?
-- Name?
Your name?
-- My name?
Bedoshruti Dey.
-- where do you stay?
Bhowanipur.
-- Bhowanipur?
That's quite far from here.
what are you doing here now?
Came looking for cigarettes.
-- You kidding me?
No.
-- Yes!
You've come from Bhowanipur
to buy smokes here?
Say the truth or I'll
put you behind bars.
I'm saying the truth.
-- Cigarette?
Or hash?
Or tablets?
As in?
Or whores?
-- See, this is not right.
Hey!
Threatening me?
I'll hammer you so hard
you'll die crapping!
This is not correct.
-- Take out all the money.
I'll complain...
-- Take out the money!
I'll complain against you...
-- To the police?
Fine, do that.
what's the case then?
what exactly happened
with you that night?
This has my card... and
important papers too.
My Voter's ID is in it.
-- Who wants to know your identity?
And who the hell wants
your vote? Now go.
Come on, get lost.
Please give it back...
-- Get lost.
if I ever see you
again in this area...
...I'll hang you
from the tree.
Get lost.
Excuse me?
Can I use your smoke to light
mine? I don't have light.
Sure.
-- Thank you.
Hello brother!
Please stop!
My cigarette...
it's my last smoke!
Sir... hello..
listen to me!
Hey!
Stop you rascal!
Hey! Give me my
cigarette!
Hey! My cigarette!
May his soul
rest in peace.
May his soul
rest in peace.
Hey! Wait,
let’s stop here.
My back is strained.
-- Let's go get a smoke.
Yes, let’s go.
-- Come on.
You've a great voice...
-- One packet of bidis please.
Done?
-- Yes, Wait.
Let's go.
So now the officer wants
us to cremate the body.
Didn't give his name, caste or
religion. what if he's not a Hindu?
The officer asked
you to burn it. Burn it.
At the end everyone's a pile of ash.
A drag of pleasure, want one?
Let's go if you guys
are done smoking.
I've been up since ever.
-- Have been carrying it for ages.
Make it fast now.
-- Let me finish the smoke.
Lot's to do! Let's go.
-- Yes.
Thank God this shop
is open all night,
or where wouid we find
a smoke at this hour?
May his soul
rest in peace.
May his soul
rest in peace.
I really like it.
Very good.
The name should be
'Smoking Kills'.
What do you plan to
shoot it on?
You tell me.
You'll shoot it.
I think I'll shoot on film.
Anyway celluloid is on its way out.
Kodak is still manufacturing.
-- is it?
Thought about the casting?
You could play Bedoshruti.
would suit you.
-- No!
Acting doesn't stimulate
me anymore.
Yours is done. Only
Trina and you're left. Joy?
Yes, I've thought
of something.
A story on football with
a political twist...
...but I don't know how to include
the theme of death.
Let's see.
Trina...
There will be time and
then there will be time.
Let's settle somewhere,
I need a setting,
I can't do this on the move.
Joy...
...What's the name of this river?
-- Hataniya Doaniya.
Nice...
how lyrical.
Lyrical?
Strange!
All I smell here is fish
and a lot of garbage.
Same old cynicism.
Tatha, did the maid come?
Tatha, did the maid come?
-- No idea.
Stop it.
Stop it!
I said stop it!
I have important things here,
if anything gets misplaced...
Then it'll be a problem composing.
So I'm tidying it up.
No need. I can't find things
if they're not scattered.
Do you get that?
And listen...
...all the cleaning up,
please do that in Dad's bedroom.
Don't try to exercise your right
in this room. Get out.
Okay I won't come.
But before that I need to know,
why do you hate me so much?
I don't like the shape of your
nose. it makes me violent. Happy?
Why?
Get lost, will you!
-- Shukla di?
Listen,
this has got nothing
to do with my mother, okay?
Then what is it, Tatha?
I need to know.
For myself.
Please!
Please?
Mum would’ve left
him anyway.
They were horribly incompatible.
Strange how they pulled it
so far. But tell me Mimi,
do you know how it feels when you feel
orphaned staying with your own father?
The man who was
my friend,
my hero, my idol...
Now he hardly speaks
to me once a week.
Then too, he shouts.
I'm having to live with a cranky
stranger who looks like my Dad.
Do you have any freaking
idea how that feels?
And you blame me for
all of this. Right?
Maybe not.
Maybe you too are looking
for the same man I'm looking for...
...but can't find.
But I need a vent too, right?
So I'm the trash can?
Should I roll one?
Joint. Should I roll one?
Let's smoke together?
But I need my remuneration.
A song.
The one you sang in
the college fest this time?
You were there?
I don't miss any of your...
your band's performances.
Why?
Because I like the
shape of your nose.
Happy?
From the literary world?
-- No.
Seventeen.
Oh no! You're
adulterating the count.
Sixteen questions. Could be
seventeen pegs of alcohol.
Not at all.
I've kept a count.
Okay fine it's seventeen.
-- I'm sure it's seventeen!
Sportsperson?
-- You can read my thoughts?
is it?
-- Yes!
Correct!
A cricketer?
Yes, nineteen.
-- Shakya, this is most unfair.
You know very well, I don't
watch anything but football.
That's your problem. if you think
of Bernard Shaw and I say that...
...I don't read anything but railway
time tables, will it be overruled?
Okay... cricketer?
Kapil Dev!
Oh no!
-- No. And twenty.
Guessing time.
-- You ruined it all!
Why not Kapil Dev?
-- He just said, he's still playing...
...and a South Indian.
-- South Indian? Okay, Prasanna?
What! Better still, you should’ve
said Gauri Prasanna!
A cricketer who's still playing!
Shakya da, give it out. Pass.
Murali Vijay!
Who is he? Plays cricket?
-- Yes, of course!
Yes. But this isn't done. You've
to think of a famous cricketer.
My neighbour plays cricket
every day, can't think of him, right?
Okay fine.
Now you think of a name.
Done.
Okay, Indian?
-- Yes.
Dead?
-- No.
So an Indian who's alive.
-- No.
What! Neither living
nor dead?
How’s that possible?
-- Possible. There are people like that.
What happened?
What happened?
-- I'll go check, Sir.
What!
Such a dense jungle outside!
-- Yes.
if the car breaks down here
we've had it.
I think we're close.
I can smell the sea.
Fine. But... how do
we get there?
we won't get anything here.
-- Yes!
Wait, I'll check.
What is it?
I don't know, I think
it's the spark plug.
Check again! what
do we do now then?
I may have to go to the city.
-- What!
And what are we
to do here then?
This is ridiculous! wait, let me
call Mr. Gupta then... this is...
I don't believe this is
happening to me!
Know what? This is like a bad
Hollywood horror film script!
Why only Hollywood? Bengali, Hindi,
Tamil, Telugu, Russian, Korean.
Where's the fun if your car doesn't
break down in a jungle on a dark night.
Mingle with the jungle then!
-- Mr. Gupta's phone is switched off.
Let me try once.
-- Oh God!
Yes, please.
98310...
-- Oh no! No network!
-- Check here?
No, Sir...
Sir, you can do one thing...
...Mr. Gupta has another
bungalow nearby.
if you can just spend the night...
-- I'm sorry, that's impossible!
We've got no arrangements made
there, God knows if there's a loo!
Same old problem!
-- Shut up!
Come on, no point delaying.
Come on!
Better than spending
the night in the jungle.
Brother, walk us to the bungalow
and leave for the city.
Okay Sir.
-- Don't laugh!
Hey guys, come on.
This'll be a tough night.
Let me take my bag.
Obviously they'll drag Amitabh
into it. it's very apparent.
Even a blind man could tell.
-- See, this isn't about Amitabh,
...or the film or
my lifestyle.
There's only one factor,
your humungous ego!
Really! How does my
ego feature here?
Of course it does! Listen, my
late night parties, my lifestyle,
my temper, none of that is an
issue. Bad excuses!
Then what is the issue?
-- The point is you're jealous of me!
You can't handle my
success, my fame! Yes!
Like a typical Indian male!
-- One second.
So you are seriously saying
that I desire these things?
Yes!
You mean I like people
discussing my personal life?
Yes!
I sleep with you, I crap every day,
all of it is being talked about and...
Listen, cut out that hypocrisy!
-- Why must I shut up?
Screaming for no reason!
-- Listen!
You too want the attention
at public places!
You too want to sign autographs wearing
shades on a cloudy day! And hello...
...you too want to be a hit!
But your art house cinema...
Yes, but what I don't want is...
...travelling through villages,
putting up a cabaret in
front of those hungry wolves...
Populist stardom can get
away with anything, right?
Oh God!
Careful with your steps.
-- The place is full of thorns.
Yes.
God!
Why did I accept the offer!
How did I ever get myself into
this mess, I don't know!
Stop grumbling.
Careful with the thorns.
You've done a lot of trekking,
you're used to all this.
I'm not and I'm not
interested either.
I think it must be made
compulsory for everyone...
...to trek for at least
two years... ouch!
What happened?
A thorn. went right in.
-- Let me see!
What?
-- it'll hurt.
Sure it will,
Mr. Braveheart!
Let me see!
Can't we do this
some other way?
No... I mean... err...
...it'll hurt.
Just shut up Dipu!
it'll hurt!
Has it ever hurt?
There.
it's gone. Your story didn't Work.
Your story about Bedoshruti...
didn't Work for me.
Well... a lot of stories
don't work, quite often.
But that does not nullify the
existence of the characters...
...or even the
moments spent.
Besides,
who's here for an
impromptu story narration?
I've come here to
see you.
is it true about you and
and that...
...that girl half my age?
-- Right!
But half my age
is a part of my age.
Dipu... for once can you...
-- Trina...
...I'm not a very reliable man.
-- I know.
Though, you too have
contributed to my degeneration.
Because whether it be the
booze or the wedding vows...
...or a night with a
fan in my bed...
...all I've ever looked for,
is you.
Now do you get it?
What happened?
Err... Diptya stepped
on a thorn.
You guys carry on.
We're coming.
No! we'll wait!
Joy...
-- Yes...
Wait there. There's a
problem here.
What is it?
A thorn.
Need to get rid of it.
Manas da...
Manas da...
...they'll stay here tonight. The car's
broken down, I've to go to the city.
Please take rest.
I'll be back by dawn.
You need food?
No, we'll manage, we're
carrying some food.
But there's no electricity
here, isn't it?
There is.
The fuse is not working
since evening.
I'm arranging for someone
to come and repair it.
Not just a producer.
I smell a film buff too.
No doubt!
The location is terrific!
The location is nearly giving
me a brilliant story idea.
Say three young men kidnap a
famous actress and bring her here.
And they plan to produce
a film, from the ransom.
But the problem is...
...I don't know how to
include death in this story now!
Death reminds me,
this is an ideal setting
for a session of planchette.
isn't it?
And that reminds me...
...that it's an ideal setting
for something else as well.
What's that?
My story!
Are you guys game?
-- Absolutely!
Brilliant idea! Planchette
and a horror story indoors...
...and if it starts drizzling! Some
fried snacks to go with it. Perfect!
A true Bengali. Even horror
comes with a food menu!
Nothing to do
till dawn. why not?
Yes!
-- Then sit down!
Sit. And Shakya, put the
camera away.
Okay.
Come on now you guys,
concentrate!
So...
...the first shot.
A middle--aged women...
but you can tell that...
...she was gorgeous when young.
Candies lit in front of her.
And in that dimly lit space,
the woman is sitting at
a table.
We do a slow track
forward on her.
Almost imperceptible.
The details around her
aren't clear.
All we understand is that
the room is quite empty.
Pin drop silence, you see.
She keeps staring at the candies.
Suddenly she says,
Who do you want to speak to?
My son.
Name?
Junaid.
Age?
Eighteen years.
Yes... tell me, Ammijaan,
I'm here!
How are you, son?
I'm good, Ammijaan,
no more problems.
Everything is fine now.
You're very short
tempered, son. Be careful.
I don't lose my temper
anymore, Ammijaan.
Don't worry.
I miss you, Junaid!
I miss stroking your hair.
But you're far away...
So...
Don't cry, Ammijaan.
it hurts when I
see you crying!
I've to go now. we'll
speak again next week?
Okay, Ammijaan.
May God be with you.
Do you really think this'll help?
-- Stop it, will you!
See, I need to do this. whoever has
a problem, don't come.
I don't think this is worth it.
Waste of time.
We need to do this.
Rather we should apologize.
Obviously you've a problem,
after all it's you...
Shut up guys! At least
not here, not now!
You guys are...
impossible!
See Nandita, I'd get it if it
was our parents. A teacher...
She was much more than
just an English teacher!
And you know that!
Come on guys! Okay fine!
I need to do this. Period.
I'm going. That's it.
Samaresh, she was your
teacher too.
There's a limit to insensitivity!
-- Guys, I think she's finished.
And she's waiting for us.
Let's go.
Yes.
Name?
Mrs. Iyer.
Mrs. Meenaxi Iyer.
it's yours.
-- Mine?
Yes.
Oh crap!
Yes.
Very sorry.
Extremely sorry. I've to
take this call.
Yes, it's fine!
Hello?
Oh okay.
Yes.
Okay.
When?
No, when did it happen?
See... actually I'm out
of town currently.
So, you'll have to
manage the situation.
So... yes.
it's serious?
Okay.
Yes, I'll try to get back
ASAP, okay?
Let me know.
Keep me updated.
Alright? Thank you.
Okay.
Hey, I'm sorry.
Really very sorry.
That's fine.
I think we better
switch off our phones.
That's better.
Very distracting.
Mine is already switched off.
-- Mine as well.
Tell me when you're done.
-- I'm ready.
Done.
So...
So, how have you been?
We're... We're good Ma’am.
No compiaints, no
regrets. Just that...
...We don't get to attend
your classes anymore.
I also miss you a lot.
-- Even us Ma’am.
I feel very lonely.
So... you people
doing good?
Samaresh, Abhijeet...
...Mithi?
-- Yes, Ma’am.
We're all doing fine, Ma’am.
We miss your poetry
classes, Ma’am.
You people loved Emily
Dickinson, isn't it?
I measure every grief I meet
With analytic eyes
I wonder if it weighs like mine
Or has an easier size
I wonder if they bore it long
Or did it just begin
I could not tell the date of mine
it feels so old a pain
I wonder if it hurts to live
And if they have to try
And whether could they
choose between
They would not rather die
I'm so sorry, Ma’am.
I'm so sorry.
But there's something
I should tell you.
What?
That night...
...We hadn't gone anywhere.
We were there itself.
Partying.
So we didn't call you,
thought you'll feel left out.
We lied to you Ma’am!
-- Oh no!
I'd feel left out
or you would get bored?
Never mind Nandita,
don't feel bad.
it happens.
-- No Ma’am!
it shouldn’t have happened. You
baked a cake for us with so much love.
You wanted to celebrate
With us and we...
We...
You're feeling
miserable, Nandita.
I must leave.
-- Ma’am!
Ma’am please don't go!
-- Stay well.
Ma’am...
Ma’am please!
Ma’am please don't go!
Happy? Couldn’t even
apologize properly!
What did I do?
-- Right!
What did you do? who
asked you to drink and drive?
The long drive, who's idea was that?
-- Nandita, it was an accident!
The truck was on
the wrong lane!
I was sitting right beside you!
Clearly saw what happened!
No you don't remember!
-- Don't forget, it's because of you...
...that we had to come so
far leaving everyone behind.
Calm down okay?
We'll come back next week.
So much of life...
...all over in a second.
Nice twist.
Thank you.
Reverse planchette.
Nice name?
Reverse Planchette?
No, really, Trina di,
the story is fabulous!
All three have the potential
if we can pull it off.
You are still left.
-- I know, actually...
...I have something in
my mind. Might just fit.
Spill it.
in the morning with a
bit of clarity?
Right now I feel like staying with
her story, enjoying its essence.
Good.
Night's nearly over.
We're off at dawn.
Lie down for a bit.
Let's spend the night
in this room itself.
Trina, you can
take that sofa.
And Joy, I think you'll
fit in that arm chair.
it's just a chair, not
much of an arm rest.
You can keep it.
Sleeping on the table
will be too much?
Yes!
if Mr. Gupta finds out...
...that the famous film makers
slept on the table...
..the caretaker may
lose his job!
No need. Might curse
me as bourgeois then!
I'll settle for the floor.
How’d you guess about the
arm chair? I smell bedbugs too.
Won't you lie down?
-- I'll spend the night reading.
Reading in this light
will ruin your eyesight.
Already ruined.
Now is the age, when
the closer things are hazy
Those far away
are crystal clear
Mosquito repellent.
Good catch!
-- Hey...
...Which way's the loo?
Has it ever hurt?
Has it?
Trina di...
...get up...
Get up?
Get up Trina di!
Come on!
Trina di?
Trina di?
Trina di?
Get up!
Trina di? it's
morning already!
What?
Good morning!
Good morning.
Where's everyone?
-- Here.
Everyone's there.
-- Where?
They're around. You'll see them.
Before that,
come with me.
Come.
Please come!
Come!
Where to?
But...
...I just saw this...
What?
-- Err...
-- You saw what?
-- Err... nothing.
Good morning!
-- Yes! Good morning!
Slept well?
-- Sound!
Felt no mosquitoes too!
And you?
-- See, over there...
...Henry's island. Our
final destination.
See!
So Joy was right.
We were quite
close to the sea.
We didn't realize.
The caretaker has made
some breakfast.
Our driver's here and the
fuse is fixed too.
We must prepare to leave then?
-- At the earliest!
I'm hungry.
-- Me too.
We didn't hear your story.
-- while we eat?
Okay.
-- Come on.
Trina di, let’s go.
-- Yes.
Should I start with my story?
-- Yes, absolutely!
Delaying since last
night. Enough suspense now.
All phones switched off?
-- Mine, since last night.
Mine too!
-- I'd switched mine on.
Wait, I'll switch it off.
-- informed home?
No one took the call.
They must be dead
asleep right now.
Okay. Let's begin then?
-- Yes!
Cool.
Morning!
-- Morning.
Good! You made
yourself tea!
Drinkable?
Be my guest.
Didn't know you had
a suicidal tendency.
That bad?
Good as port wine but
as tea this is...
Can't take so much insult.
I'll try once more.
Spoke to Sir?
-- Called him. Switched off.
My story is called 'Nemesis'.
Backdrop; our film industry.
Nemesis? You mean
Greek Goddess of retribution?
Right.
Vengeful fate.
-- in simpler words, destiny.
it is set in the 1970s.
Pass me a bread, I'm hungry!
Thank you. And I want
to shoot it in black and white.
Wow!
-- Okay, black and white!
Period film. industry.
Theme of death.
Philosopher’s stone!
-- With terracotta finish!
That's enough.
Now begin.
Yes...
so...
There are three primary
characters in this story.
An actress.
An actor.
And a director.
Say... the actress'
name is Nllanjana.
The actor's name is Ritwik and
the director's name is Amitava.
Now...
...Nllanjana was a
leading superstar of her time.
As in a star from
the commercial films.
Ritwik was a good painter.
Was an illustrator. Okay?
Was into theatre.
He rose from the stage.
And Amitava,
their common friend.
initially a cinematographer,
later began directing films.
will send you my mailing address,
for the royalty cheque.
My wife's brother is a lawyer. He'll
drag you to the high court directly.
Joy! This is what
was cooking!
Anyway, continue.
So...
...between these three people there
was a common geometrical pattern.
A triangle.
Nllanjana fell in love with
Ritwik, impressed by his acting.
And soon after that
they had an affair.
They used to connect
intellectually.
Both loved music,
cinema, theatre.
Both loved reading. And
Amitava loved Nllanjana.
Unreciprocated,
obviously.
Okay? But Amitava was
much more than just...
...the corner of the triangle
usually ignored in literature.
There was a deep
friendship between the three.
And Nllanjana used to depend
on Amitava a lot.
Amitava too was very
protective about Nllanjana.
He wouldn’t let it show,
Ritwik was there you see.
So, around...
...this time...
...a producer entered
their lives.
He came with a lot of money.
wishing to direct and
produce a film.
Wanted to cast Nllanjana and
Ritwik as the lead pair.
Amitava had assisted
a few people by now.
He was almost famous.
Nllanjana and Ritwik
convinced this man to...
...take Amitava as the
director in this film.
So the producer scared
of losing his lead pair...
I don't think this is
very ethical, Joy.
...Which story is
original?
Only life is. Right?
Let's have one based on true
facts, unlike the other three?
what's Wrong With a
little change?
if you're being audacious,
go all the Way.
Put up a card.
All characters and
events are real.
Any resemblance to
any imaginary person...
...living or dead is
purely coincidental.
Let's get back to the story?
-- Yes, We better. So...
...the shoot began. initially
it Was all very smooth.
But Nllanjana and Ritwik
relationship became a problem.
See, any love story
has a graph.
Their graph became
downward sloping.
Both started discovering that as
lovers they Weren't quite compatible.
it Wasn't Working.
Their lifestyle,
philosophies...
...there Were massive
differences!
And With this started the fights,
misunderstandings, ego clashes,
suspicion...
-- Joy, this is too personal!
I'm sorry.
-- wait.
You carry on.
-- what!
Okay!
And all of this started
affecting the film.
The shoot Was getting delayed.
Their acting Was suffering.
Amitava, Who Was involved
with both of them,
he too started losing
interest in the project.
But he was not being able
to say anything to these two.
He had got the break
because of them!
As a result of these reasons, after
finishing about seventy percent of it,
the film got shelved.
Nllanjana refused to work with
Ritwik and Amitava left the film.
I think we must leave
now. we're...
Wait. Let's finish the story.
Now this producer guy,
he was completely ruined.
impoverished!
invested hell lot of money!
All the money was over.
About to sell off his
ancestral house.
He still was
managing somehow.
But the one who
couldn’t was...
...his wife.
Kawna.
She came from a
poor family.
Suffered from
financial insecurity.
When she saw all her jewelry
getting sold one by one,
she couldn’t take it anymore.
So one day, he came home
after a tough day of work,
then he opened the
study to see,
his wife, Kawna's body
hanging from the ceiling.
He was shocked.
Natural.
He was very shocked. And
due to that massive shock...
....he lost his mental
stability for life.
He went completely mad.
Not bad. Nice actually.
Then it boils down to? A heart attack
due to psychological reasons,
a car accident trying to buy
smokes, a reverse planchette...
...and suicide.
it does have a range.
So you're condoning it?
-- What?
These personal things...
-- Oh stop it!
At least it's not a frame to
frame remake of a Tamil film.
Besides, it's life we adapt from,
right?
it's fine. Only the
name's baffling me.
Why 'Nemesis'?
What's her name?
Kawna.
There's no relation between
Kawna’s suicide and retribution.
Point.
At least the audience
doesn't know of it.
There's no back story.
Then?
-- You're right.
Didn't say the
story's over.
This was just the pre--title.
it is the cause, it is the
cause, my soul,
Let me not name it to you,
you chaste stars!
it is the cause.
Yet...
...I will not shed her blood.
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers
than snow,
And smooth as
monumental alabaster.
Yet...
...she must die,
else she will betray more men.
Put out the light
And then...
...put out...
...the light.
if I quench thee,
thou...
Sir...
Oh it's you!
is it here?
Yes, here it is.
Be careful with it!
-- They're doing this all day.
Put them there,
in that corner.
Yes, right here.
And this, here.
See, Sir,
delivered as promised!
Thank you.
Thank you so much!
Now I've to do up
the house nicely.
Happy anniversary!
Oh.
Thanks once again.
Actually I've been planning
this surprise for quite some time.
it's time that we started
surprising each other again.
Actually, my story starts twenty
years after this incident.
Nllanjana has now quit acting
and turned to direction.
Amitava was always into it.
Ritwik too has made
quite a few films,
though of a very
different genre.
For the masses, you see.
Their personal lives
are very different.
They do bump into each other
at work sometimes. That's it.
And at this stage, a fourth
character enters our story.
Remember that man,
the producer,
Who went mad due to
his wife's suicide?
That guy...
that producer fellow...
...had a step brother.
Though not really
a 'step'--brother.
Because they loved him
more than their own child.
Now, coincidentally, the
day the incident happened,
this little brother was
present over there.
He saw it happen
in front of him.
Obviously, he was
scarred for life.
This is not happening!
Oh yes it is!
it actually is!
You know, this guy is...
...very interesting! See, he
was always a good student so,
though his guardian went bankrupt
he completed his education.
Stayed abroad.
Got a scholarship.
Finished his education.
But...
...he had a different motive.
He was quite good looking.
So he came to the city, as a TV
actor, thereby joining the industry.
Diptya da, listening?
Very interesting. Go on.
-- Thank you so much!
Now, he is in Kolkata but
how does he fulfil his purpose?
According to his plan
he had to become a director.
But he became
an actor!
So, he started
training himself.
Gradually, he used his
contacts and made a few films.
He grew up in a film buff's
home, always had the interest.
His purpose and ideas provided
him with the rest of the passion.
He became quite famous and
became really close to these three.
Ah Joy! Enough is enough!
Cock and bull story!
Not yet bull's eye.
Shakya da, let me finish!
Sheer rubbish!
-- So then, as planned,
he made up a producer
and fooled the trio.
Also made up a
a proposal.
Used a fake visiting card
and phone number too.
The fake producer never arrived,
he got them alone outside the city.
Diptya da, trying to turn on your
phone? Do not! I'm not done yet!
Sanjay!
Sanjay!
-- Stop dragging your climax!
Who's Sanjay now?
Here he is. Sanjay, please
take their phones away.
Phone?
-- Phone! Joy!
You're crossing your limit, Joy!
You've gone crazy!--
Mistake, Trina di. Not
me. My brother became crazy.
What!
-- Yes!
My brother...
...Who still thinks he's a producer
Who's to make a film with you three.
Please don't make it difficult for
me. Give him your phones. Please.
The question doesn't arise! I refuse
to participate in this nonsense.
Diptya, Shakya, you guys...
-- Trina!
You'll narrate your story to
us at gunpoint? You rascal!
The revolver is real.
And loaded.
Always wanted to create nice production
designs for my films, like you, Trina di.
Couldn’t do it in films,
did it here.
So please.
You guys too.
Hand him the phones.
-- This is too much!
Please give him your phones!
-- This is the limit, Joy!
Thank you very much. it's a distraction
When narrating a story. Anyway.
Yes.. so after
successfully entrapping them...
...in a desolate bungalow
in the middle of a jungle,
this guy, he decides to...
...kill them.
-- What!
One by one.
Yes.
Diptya da, now you know
Why I named it, 'Nemesis'?
What I was saying is... Joy,
this matter requires a
bit of a discussion...
No more discussion.
As per the Clint East wood lingo,
''When you want to shoot,
shoot. Don't talk.''
Whatever kind of
shooting that might be.
And just to put things
in perspective,
I used to call my brother's
wife, Mummy.
And Diptya da,
quoting your hit dialogue...
''You can always find another wife.
But never another mother.''
Listen, Joy, consider this that we
didn't know anything about all of it!
You are an impeccable
actress, Trina di. wait,
and I respect you
for that.
This bit could’ve been
a little more convincing.
You all with the police
covered up the entire fiasco!
Try to understand,
Trina was out of it.
I and Diptya had
no other option.
Try to understand!
-- I do understand. See,
don't get me wrong.
I do understand!
But I too don't have any options!
I hope you understand that!
Manas da...
Manas da!
Manas da, come here please.
Come to me.
Let me introduce you guys,
Manas da is Sanjay's father...
...and was my
brother's driver.
Oh by the way, Diptya da,
a huge fan of yours.
Listen, the idea is brilliant. we
can do some nice mounting too.
But I think it's time for
the curtains, please!
Drop scene please!
-- Sure, that'll happen.
Since you've mentioned 'mounting',
let me say something.
I've always made
light films, so...
...I've decided on a grand, serious,
mind--blowing climax for the last one.
No jump cuts, no
caller tune friendly songs,
no sweet bantering on a
blue sofa set. Only...
...Russian Roulette.
-- What!
Yes, Three Musketeers,
how’s that?
I'm out of here!
-- Oh no!
Hey!
-- What's all this!
What are you doing!
-- Listen to me,
all three of you have to die.
Only four bullets.
The question is, what's the order?
That'll be decided by fate... oops!
Lady Nemesis!
-- Joy!
I think of you as my brother.
I'm like your eider sister!
'Like' my sister, yes.
Not really a sister.
Never had a sister, only
a sister--in--law.
The last time I saw her, she
was hanging from the ceiling.
Her tongue hanging out
like this. Let's start?
Joy! This is madness!
-- Please!
This is madness, Joy!
-- Sanjay?
No... Joy...
One...
-- No please!
No!
No!
Two...
-- Joy, listen!
Please!
-- Joy, please!
Joy, please!
Three!
Brilliant! isn't it?
This is mounting!
This is called mounting! Sanjay,
what are you waiting for?
The next one now!
Move on!
Oh no!
You're doing it wrong!
He's next. She's the
Queen Bee! At the end!
No! Joy, after me!
-- No, Joy!
This is crazy!
-- Just stop this!
No!
No!
So...
...this is how the world
ends for me.
Not with a whimper...
...but with a bang.
I'm keeping this line in
the script. Definitely!
At this point, a slow
track--in starts.
Gradually it becomes a mid-close
of Diptya da's. And then...
One!
Two...
...three!
Bravo, old man!
Best climax!
My best climax so far!
Unbelievable!
Sanjay?
in your position?
Very good!
Trina di?
Trina di...
Trina di... see...
...I've made all arrangements
so that there's minimal pain.
Rather, no pain.
Okay?
You can trust me on this!
I'm serious!
Please cooperate! And please, none
of you must take this personally.
Won't hurt.
Not a bit.
Just bear with me a little more?
Please be a good girl now?
Just a... matter of a fraction
of a second. Trust me!
I'm very...
...happy in my life.
I don't know when, while pretending
to be happy, I really got sad
Moloy... takes very good care
of me, in spite of the fights.
Just like Shakya would
earlier.
But Dipu, had you
been there...
...had you been there, it
would’ve been a different life.
Okay do it!
Do it!
What lines!
What lines!
Unforgettable!
Timeless!
A small insert
of Diptya da's here.
And then a tight close--up of
Trina di's through an eighty--five lens!
Get it over with!
And in the background
we hear...
My eternal mate...
Just do it Joy!
Don't leave me
Don't leave me behind
in this word’s worldliness
I, your fearless,
silent mate
My God!
Joy!
Joy!
Baban! Get up, Baban!
-- Sir!
Get up! Please come here
and help us!
We must take him to
the hospital!
Nothing has happened
to him! He'll be fine!
Let me see...
Shakya won't come?
No, said, he can't handle it.
Hello.
Hello.
-- Hello.
Thank you for coming.
Actually, I read your
application.
The legal issues won't be a
problem. Everything is in order.
But before formal taking
over of the responsibility...
...I think you must personally
meet him once.
Okay.
How is he?
See for yourself.
May I come in, Sir?
You have two visitors.
Must be from the media, I don't
want to speak to them right now.
No... Joyobroto has sent them
with updates on the shoot.
Oh!
Send them in then!
Please come in!
Here you are!
What's going on?
That bugger told me Trina
and Diptya are ready.
Shoot's to begin any day!
I accepted their condition
to take a new director!
Then he vanishes!
-- No...err..
What? is this how films are
made? The entire unit is waiting!
They're quitting one by one! I'm
paying for this huge set every day!
Trina, Shakya, Dipta! All've
disappeared! is this a joke?
Wasting shit loads of money!
I'm trying to make a
different film...
...and no one sees the
importance of money here!
isn't the money important?
-- No, you see...
...of course it is!
-- Then?
Disgusting!
Bunch of unprofessionals!
Stars ehh!
Big stars!
Tell Trina, if she refuses
this author backed role,
she'll spend her life
playing a doll in films!
And now, I'll file a
case against them.
How dare they back
out after committing!
You... go get me Advocate
Pritish Bagchi's number!
See... I'm trying my levei best...
-- Trying? What do you mean!
I'm giving you an ultimatum! They
must join back within two days!
And that guy, Diptya,
What's with him?
Which significant piece
of work has he done?
Should’ve cast
Mr. Uttam Kumar instead.
Would’ve been a bit old for
it. But he'd do it sincerely.
But since it's an
ex--Naxalite's character he...
Why are you crying, Ma’am?
Why is she crying?
Because I said I'll file a case? Was
just scaring you, won't do that.
Come sit.
would you like tea?
I'll not file any case!
Please sit!
I really won't!
And why're you standing?
Call them!
Call them!
I think I scared them!
Excuse me.
-- Yes, Sir?
Mrs. Sen is inside, kindly tell
her a friend of hers had come.
I'll just be back.
Okay?
Sure Sir.
