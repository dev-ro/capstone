The Fuhrer trust our people.
The most difficult task entrusted to us: the Tanenbur ?? ku line.
And we, the local Estonian units, we will not sit idly by.
Years of research have shown,

It is an indisputable fact.
Under the auspices of the Greater German Reich bright future awaits us
the big European family.

In 1940, they convicted after the June coup.
What are we doing here?
- This is not our war. - Are you sure?
- Not what we started. - Hitler attacked Russia.
And when Finland was attacked? When occupied the Baltic states?
When Poland was invaded? The devil would wipe out!
The Poles were all attacked.
You know what? The red Estonians return home.
Some return home. Not much of a handful.
- Thousands! - The only Soviet propaganda.
What if you meet with Estonian red?
- The compatriots. - The Reds will be no more.
Do not you understand? Millions of them! This is an avalanche. The red plague.
It looks like you do not understand anything!
Higadj it!

Karl, grab your gun! Get ready, we'll go. We are the last, we are waiting for the trucks.
- Where are you? - Germany. That's an order.
I'm staying.
You think yours may return from Siberia, if you stay?
- I do not think. - Then?
Do you know how many I've seen such a thing like you?
Persisting in a week, a month ... and that's it.
What is the purpose of the stay that be?
From that we will be free?
If you want ...
... stay here.

Without the ball they do not reach anything like the shirt without buttons.
Heil Hitler!
Wait!
Where are you going, the Fair?

There are potatoes, ham, bread ...
Well better to die un- occupied.

Shame on a full stomach to die.

Not everyone is applied to Siberia.
While we are preparing to fight in the friccek ships fleeing.
Tallinn is released and the brave Estonians
Who's tri-color flag on the tallest building than in 1918.
If you will not run into someone.
Do not talk like that.
I thought then, arrest them ...
and remain in the city.
When the guys said what was happening, I rushed to the train station.
The last train had already left.
I stopped at an intersection and thinking.
Maybe I was right.
Then I went home.

He believed himself to blame for what happened to Mom, Dad and our sister.
And you?
In 1939 he was drafted into the army.

Perhaps we are too disciplined and waited for the command.
Or simply afraid.
Then a few months later, no one knew how, we became the Red Army.

And his family?
Rudy, Allie, Oskar, Abram, Prohor ... They're my family.
