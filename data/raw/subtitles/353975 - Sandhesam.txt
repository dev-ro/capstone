'SANDESHAM'
"Oh, Lord Murugan
residing at Mount Maruthai."
"Oh, Lord Murugan
residing at Mount Maruthai."
"You are the Lord who protects
our land."
"Oh, Lord Murugan
residing at Mount Maruthai."
"You are the Lord who protects
our land."
"Oh, Lord Murugan
residing at Mount Maruthai."
"You are adorned with
sandalwood and saffron."
Where were you, Muniswami?
It's time for the train.
I was at the temple to perform
a veneration for Mr. Raghavan.
Where is he?
- He went to Velayappan's house.
Be happy wherever you are.
I am indebted to
your love and gratitude.
I was a stranger to this land
but this became my home now.
You are the reason for that.
Life is a like a train
which keeps moving.
Bye, ma'am. - Sir.
- Bye. - Okay, sir.
Bye, ma'am.
- Okay.
Silambarasan, Kaveri. Bye.
- Okay.
Don't forget us.
- Don't talk like that.
I can't forget you.
You should visit once in a while.
I will come for sure. Bye.
- Okay.
Bye.
- See you.
"Cuckoo bird, my cuckoo bird..."
- Sir, it's time.
Let's leave. - Sir,
I've done an offering for you.
I really don't want
to leave this place.
I understand how much
you love me now.
You are not just a
station master to us.
You are like a God to us.
Don't say that.
I am an ordinary man.
I have worked in
Tamil Nadu for 30 years now.
Now, I have retired.
I'm going back home.
You showed me what
love and respect is.
Life is a like a train
that keeps moving.
But the difference is that my
train is about to start now.
Oh, no!
Stop or I'll kill you today..
Is this an aeroplane?
It's always in the sky.
It's me calling.
You don't know who I am.
Come.
Oh, no! It is just cow dung
and nothing else. Thank God.
There it goes.
My God!
It's either you or me now.
Watch where you're going.
Where have you escaped from?
Are you blind?
I'm running out of time.
The chicken is really fast.
I think it was in the Olympics.
The train must have
come and gone by now.
I don't think so. The trains in
this country never arrive on time.
My clothes are dirty.
I'll just change it.
Oh, no. There's no time
for that now.
Okay, then.
Bhanu..
The chicken is here.
- Who is going to kill it?
That is right. I do it every time.
Get the knife..
Mom, father will be waiting at
the station. Give her the chicken.
Hold it. It won't hurt you.
Hold it. - Mr. Achu, come here.
Leave my hand. My clothes..
- That's okay. It's fine.
I can't go without it.
- It's already late.
That is okay. It's usual.
Mr. Raghavan is here.
The train was on time today.
Anyway, I didn't have to go.
- I'd told you.
Okay.
- He must have felt bad.
Doesn't he know the way home?
Mom, father is here.
I've been ready since morning.
Mr. Achu made it late..
Oh, no. It's not because of me.
The chicken..
Where are Prabha and Prakashan?
- They are not here. That's why I..
But me and the chicken..
- What!
Oh, no. Not me. Mrs. Bhanu..
- What?
She said she wanted the chicken.
I was running behind it.
I finally got it now.
Didn't you get my message?
- What? - I meant my letter.
I got it.
- Okay.
Leave that to me.
You can take rest, Mr. Raghavan.
Be careful.
- I'll be careful.
I was referring to the luggage.
Not you. Be careful with it.
I'll be careful.
- Okay.
Come here, dear..
Help me. It's very heavy.
Mix some coriander leaves
and garlic as well, dear.
Oh, no. Should I really add that?
Father likes that. What can we do?
After that, crush these onions.
- Okay.
What is this, Achu?
Don't do that here.
The feathers will fall
in the water well.
Did you think I'm that careless?
Achu, come. Let's go.
- Where?
I wanted to swim in the pond
ever since I got here.
The water back there is bad.
The chlorine smell is bad, too.
Munichamy brings me good water,
though. - Who is that? - A porter.
He cares for me. He knows what
I want if I show my right hand.
He understands if I show
my left hand as well.
He might not understand
if you don't show your hands then.
Don't bathe in cold water.
You are old. You'll get sick.
Bhanu, I'm not that old.
Come, Achu.
Where? - To bathe.
- Yes. That's true.
Achu, the chicken.
I've been chasing it since
morning. Let it be there.
Look at that. - I'll hit you.
- Lathika.
How was the rain this year?
- It was really good.
This was the best rain
since the floods in 1951.
We don't get rain there.
Even drinking water is scarce.
Mr. Raghavan,
you are not in Tamil Nadu anymore.
Forget Tamil. This is Kerala.
Speaking of which, how is our land?
It is the same. You said not to
start working before you came.
Do you check once in a while?
- I do.
You'd borrowed money
to buy the land.
I paid it off
using my pension money.
That land is my livelihood
from now on.
Don't worry, Mr. Raghavan.
Land has never betrayed anyone.
That's what I believe.
Without the sound of a train which
I've been hearing for 30 years
how can I live here?
I can come to your house every
morning and make train sounds.
Shut up! What do you know
my relationship with trains?
Are you family? - It's more
important than that. - Okay.
The train stops when I wave a flag.
It leaves when I change
the flag colour.
A train was going from Athipatti
to Gummidipoondi one night.
M2 down.
- Okay.
The track was derailed.
I was not on duty.
I was just out walking.
This train is really fast.
The signal showed green.
I became tense.
There were thousands of factory
workers in the train. - Really?
I didn't think of anything else.
I removed my shirt and lit it up.
I jumped onto the track.
- Oh!
The driver understood when he
saw the fire. He stopped the train.
I have seen something like this
in a Tamil movie. - Really? - Yes.
Yes. 'Pachai Vilakku'.
Sivaji Ganesan does the same thing.
You've seen that film, right?
- This actually happened.
You haven't stopped fibbing.
'Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.'
'One of the greatest figures
in world history.'
'He was a..'
Please get up.
I need to make the bed.
You said that Prashanthan
does not study anything.
Don't blame the children.
Look at how hard he is studying.
He does this every evening
for half an hour
or an hour at the most.
- Maybe that's all he needs.
I knew that he was talented
since he was young.
'..at Allahabad. Not quite 15,
he went to Harrow school'
'in England and then to Cambridge.
After..'
Sit over there.
Look at this in detail.
Velayappan is the guy behind me.
- What?
Velayappam?
- Velayappan.
Funny name.
- This is Veliyappan.
Really? Another 'Appan'?
- They are brothers.
If there are any more 'Appans',
say it all together.
There are no more 'Appans.'
Only 'Chamis'.
This is Palanichamy,
Munichami and Veerachami.
Don't you have friends
with good names?
These are really good names there.
- Yuck!
Father, what do you want
for dinner?
I need something light for dinner.
Otherwise, 'Puliogare' will do.
She doesn't know
how to cook all that.
Didn't you learn?
I've told you many times.
I forgot, Father.
Eat normal food now.
Make some curd rice instead.
Make some rice.
He'll mix some curd and eat it.
That's not the same, Bhanu.
- It is the same.
You are here now, eat the food
from here now. Not Tamil Nadu food.
That will do. Go. - Okay.
- Dear, I need bananas at night.
I can't stand it
when you talk in that accent.
We have plenty of bananas.
I spent 33 years in Tamil Nadu.
So what? I was there for eight
years too. I don't speak Tamil.
Leave it. Isn't Lathika
writing her exams again?
Why? It's a waste of money.
That's enough of her studies.
I am worried about our sons.
Prabhakaran and Prakashan
are into politics full-time.
So what? Politics is a good
profession these days.
You are old-fashioned. That's why.
I was in the railways for 33 years.
Who knows me?
Some porters might recognise me.
That is all.
A public servant can even
become the President of India.
Mahatma Gandhi, Subhas Chandra Bose
Gokhale, Vallabhbhai Patel.
We wouldn't have got independence
if it were not for them. Idiot.
You and your sons
deserve each other.
One of them is a lawyer
and he doesn't practise law.
The other one doesn't want to
work after graduating with B.Sc.
He has gone to Thiruvananthapuram
for the swearing-in ceremony.
They hate each other.
You always get
upset for simple matters.
I am here to spend the rest
of my life peacefully.
Stop talking like that about
our children. Let me be at peace.
'Police.'
Hello. Who is this? - Put your
husband Anandan on the line.
He is not here.
- You'd better put him on the line.
He is really not here.
Don't lie. If he is not there,
why is the police jeep outside?
Who is it?
- Here! - What? - Here!
Sub Inspector Anandan speaking.
- You will be in trouble soon.
Your end is near.
Didn't you beat up
our party members?
Did you think that
we wouldn't come back to power?
Friend. I..
- Shut up, you donkey!
Who are you?
- The grim reaper!
Who was that?
- The grim reaper.
What?
- He wants to kill me.
It was a different voice
on the phone yesterday.
Yes. That must be a
different grim reaper.
Many people from my station
limits call to abuse me.
All this happened because of you.
I never thought that the
government would change.
RDP people told me to beat up
the INSP people. So I did.
Anyway, I'm done for.
I'm worried if they'll kidnap
our children. - Oh, no!
Kidnapping is the new trend.
Do this.
Don't send the children to school
from tomorrow. - Okay.
I'll see you.
- Okay.
I'll see you in the evening
if I manage to stay alive. - What?
Oh, no! Goons! They are coming.
Goons..
How many goons are there, Latha?
- It's not goons. It's father.
Whose father?
- My father.
Your own father?
- Obviously.
You didn't come over.
Why didn't you?
Oh, no!
I heard that you'd come.
I didn't come over
because I was really upset.
What happened? Was that
Anandan who just ran away? - Yes.
He is scared of goons.
- Goons?
Yes. Political goons.
They belong to your son
Prakashan's party.
When they were the
opposition party, I had to
beat them up. They are threatening
me now that they've come to power.
Really? We should never hurt
anyone like that, Anandan.
I couldn't refuse when the
ruling party asked me to do it.
I heard that Prakashan is a
leader of the ruling party.
Not really.
But even he can help me.
I asked him to come here
for that but he never did.
Oh, no. He has gone to the capital
for the swearing-in ceremony.
Sit inside, Father.
Step aside. Don't make a ruckus..
Don't rush. Get down..
My God!
Govindankutty, we'll pay for the
lorry in the evening. - Okay..
Hello, KRP. How was the ceremony?
- It was amazing.
Really? - I'll tell you
in detail later. My back hurts.
I travelled 800 kilometres
back and forth while standing.
Is everything ready for evening?
- Yes.
I'll see you in the
evening for the ceremony.
Okay. - Okay.
- Jai Hind! - Jai Hind!
It was amazing.
The biggest function Kerala has
ever seen. You should have come.
The crowd was huge.
An ocean of political activists.
Mother, I couldn't even
hear the swearing-in properly.
The crowd was very enthusiastic
from the minute the CM came in.
I could see everything properly
because I was in the front.
In the front?
- Yes. In the front.
There were 31 of us in the front.
There are 31 chairs in a row.
For the normal members
who couldn't get in the hall
there were 123 televisions outside.
But, the TVs were not clear.
I have a lot to tell you.
I'm really hungry, Mother.
Give me something to eat.
Neither of my sons could pick up
their dad from the station. - What?
Don't act like you did something
important. - When did father come?
Your elder son was here. The guy
whose party lost the elections.
Where is he?
I want to see him badly.
You want to fight with him again,
don't you?
Oh, no! There is nothing to fight
about. I just want to see him
and pay condolences to his party.
That is all.
Prakashan, that is not needed.
He is your older brother.
He has not come home since
the election results came out.
It's because of you.
Achu said that he saw him at
the junction last night.
Really? I'm happy. I want to
meet him in this situation.
He almost had me beat up in
the 9th ward during the election.
Who? Prabhakaran?
- You don't know, Mother.
Get me a strong tea first.
I have work to do.
Heat up some water.
My whole body aches.
We did the trip in the car back
and forth without any stops.
A car? Didn't you go in a lorry?
No. Me and the party
president went in the car.
You are lying.
I don't need to lie to you.
Heat up some water.
Were there TVs in the hall
during the ceremony?
There is no need for that.
We can watch ceremony in person.
After the ceremony, the CM told me
'well done, my boy.'
I was really proud.
Our party got 7000 votes more
this year in Maanamkara.
Somebody told him that I
was crucial to achieving that.
Yes.. That's not what I asked.
You said that the TVs were sub-par
and that the video feed was bad.
- So what?
You were in the front of the hall.
How did you watch
that ceremony from the TV outside?
I couldn't sit there
throughout the ceremony.
I went out to get some air.
This is when I saw the TVs.
Tell me the truth. Did you even
get inside the gate of Raj Bhavan?
Don't talk too much.
I don't need to convince you
about my position in the party.
Come to the town in the evening.
You will know who I am
when you hear my speech.
Okay.
Dear friends, was there a ruling
government for past five years?
Was there a government or
Chief Minister? I want to ask that.
Dear friends, there was none.
There was only a party named RDP.
They made a mess of things.
They call themselves as
the Revolutionary Democratic Party.
What do they mean by revolution
and democracy? I want to ask that.
You have punished
them for their deeds.
The Indian National Secular Party
belongs to you.
This party is for fulfilling the
hopes and desires of the public.
RDP members say that there are
racial parties along with us.
That is wrong.
I can't deny that there is
racism within us.
No one has practised racism
after joining our party.
Is having chicken racism?
But, I want to tell you that RDP
members are all racists.
I want to request you
to believe the same.
Some say that we are corrupt.
- I want to talk, too.
Shut up. Let him talk.
- We are not corrupt.
We have taken money from rich men
for the election fund.
That's only because of love.
I believe that rich men
are really good.
I felt so sad when I heard that
RDP members abuse them.
Poor rich men.
RDP was punished for their deeds.
Some RDP members challenged us
in this Maanamkara region.
That they would shave half their
moustaches if INSP won.
I invite them here.
If they have pride and respect,
they should come
and shave their moustaches..
I order them!
I request them for the same.
'RDP office.
Smoking is injurious to health.'
That rascal is insulting our party,
Uthaman.
We need to tolerate it.
- Yes.
You said you would shave half your
moustache if they won, Prabhakaran.
Yes. I didn't think
that they would win.
Why did the public betray us?
There were people who didn't belong
to any party.
They cheated us.
Our government has given many
things to the public.
They have only given
fake promises.
Uthaman, we shouldn't criticise
our own party.
Especially in this
current scenario.
I was thinking about something.
What is it?
We got into trouble because the
public became literate.
How is that?
The public became smart
when they became literate.
I suspect that they didn't vote for
us because they became smart.
That's true. The public will shun
all parties if they became smart.
How good it is
in other states of India.
They will vote for anyone like
film stars and others.
Because they are illiterate. They
worship film actors and stones.
Leave it.
Do you have some money to buy
'Vada' and tea?
Everything is over.
I didn't go home
after the elections.
My younger brother was standing
there and laughing at me.
How will I face him?
I will die of hunger
if I don't go home.
You should face him some day,
Prabhakaran.
Yes. I had made many challenges
because I thought we would win.
It was a mistake.
I was giving the speech
with enthusiasm.
The public was applauding
and cheering for me.
Dad, let me tell you a truth.
I got applause for every word.
I saw him during the speech.
He hid inside the party office when
he understood that I saw him.
I got more enthusiastic then.
I asked where were those
who said that they would
shave their moustache if we won.
He didn't come back after that.
You shouldn't have said that, Son.
Dad, politics is an attack
using everything we have.
The enemies will attack us
if we don't.
Is it?
- Yes, of course.
You should have brought him here
after the speech.
That's nice. I can't go in their
party office wearing this 'Khadi'.
Prabhakaran is coming here.
- Where is he?
He is coming through the back door.
He is not brave enough to come here
through the front door.
Keep your mouth shut.
Bring the plate, dear.
- Yes.
Where were you, Prabha?
It's been days since I came home.
Come inside. Have lunch.
Prabha.
He is ashamed that he lost.
Prakashan, I have
told you to shut up.
Bhanu, ask him to
come and have lunch.
I will call him if he keeps
his mouth shut.
You shouldn't talk, okay?
- No, Dad. I won't talk.
You are seeing your dad
after four months.
Why didn't you talk to him?
Come with me.
Your dad is calling you.
I will come
after the other guy leaves.
Other guy?
Prakashan is your brother.
He is my enemy, Mom.
Prabha, please don't sadden Dad.
He is getting old.
I will come.
But, he shouldn't talk to me.
He shouldn't talk
about the election or my moustache.
I will get angry if he does so.
I have told him not to talk
to you. Come on.
He shouldn't smile at me, either.
Walk.
What is this? What is happening
between you and him?
Have lunch.
When did you come, Dad?
- Thank God.
I am glad to hear your voice.
Give him some fish curry.
Mom, give him some more rice.
He might be tired.
Mom.
You have done with lunch, right?
Get up. Come on.
Son, in elections.. Damn.
What is it called? One party wins
and another loses.
This was pathetic.
I don't want lunch.
- Sit down.
Sit down, Son.
Prakashan.
- No, Dad. I won't talk.
Don't be too proud. IMF officials
will come soon to arrest us.
For what? - They have taken
loans from IMF on our behalf.
Dad, they won't arrest us.
We pay the interest
of IMF promptly.
They have kept tonnes of gold
as security abroad for that.
That is not against
the constitution.
The law allows
investing gold abroad.
The law?
If this continues, the poor women
in our state will have to go abroad
to buy gold for their marriage
and other purposes.
Dad, they can buy it from there
if they want it so badly.
The ordinary people are suffering
because of demonetisation.
Do you know that, Dad?
I heard that.
Dad, demonetisation
is a good move.
We will have dollars and business
enterprises because of that.
Our country will become a paradise
in next five years.
This government will collapse
within six months.
It won't happen. You shouldn't be
angry at me because you lost.
Prakashan.
- Don't interfere, Mom.
We won because the public wants us.
You didn't do anything for that.
You kicked Ortega out of Nicaragua.
The capitalist country America
created a puppet government there.
Romania went through the same fate.
You destroyed Germany.
But the public in Vietnam,
Cambodia and North Korea
are our great support.
Why did you talk about
international matters now?
The story of humans
is the same everywhere.
You shouldn't talk if you don't
know about international politics.
Who said I don't?
You can ask me.
What happened in Hungary?
The leader who was criticised as
a despot was recognised as good
and the public brought him back
and praised him for his deeds.
Ask me more.
I will tell you.
What happened in Poland?
Don't talk about Poland.
I don't like it.
The government was forced to quit
due to solidarity and Lech Walesa.
I will get angry if you talk more
about Poland.
Poland does not belong to you.
Don't talk about Poland.
- What will you do if I do?
Prakashan, please leave. - I will
show you. - Prabha.
Dad.
- Please leave. Sit down.
Sit down.
Have lunch.
- No, Dad. I don't want it.
Do you see now?
Bhanu.
I understood everything now.
I understood why you talk
about Prabhakaran and Prakashan.
What is it? - You are not
smart to understand them.
Neither am I.
But, there is a small difference
between us.
I have seen the world.
Do you know how many great men
I have met
during their journey
through Usilampatti?
Don't think that your sons
are like them.
You don't know what they did here
during election time.
We can rest in future
by being the parents
of Prabhakaran and Prakashan.
I know that they will become great
men by their current paths.
My children
will become great people.
Why are you so late?
- I was a little late.
You can go.
Then, that digit..
Come here.
Have you made this a habit?
A cow tried to attack me
on the way here, teacher.
Silence!
These children were not
attacked by cows.
The cow must have
something against me.
Your insubordination
is getting out of control.
Show me your homework.
I couldn't do it because we had
no power at home last night.
Your excuses are too much.
I will..
You are here on time.
I wasn't sure if you'd
be in time for tea.
I've made 'Upma' for you.
It is on the table.
I'm getting tired of Prashanthan.
At this rate, I'll tell the
headmaster to kick him out.
What did he do today?
He caught my hand
when I tried to hit him.
Oh, no!
I'll threaten him secretly.
That won't do now.
I didn't tell Mrs. Bhanu
because you told me not to.
His dad is here now. Let them
decide what to do with their son.
Leave it, teacher.
Don't take it seriously.
Children are supposed
to be like that.
We don't understand it
because we don't have children.
There is nothing we didn't do
to have a child.
We did venerations and ceremonies
many times. As a result
God gave you naughty children.
The only difference is that
they are your students.
Are you hurt already?
Can't I joke around a bit?
We don't lack anything just
because we don't have children.
Have tea. I'll give him
a couple of beatings now.
Are you researching law?
Is that you, Dad? I was scared,
thinking that you are a capitalist.
Why are you afraid of them?
They are the only ones
to be scared of, Dad.
The enemies of the revolution.
The true hurdles to overcome
what we need to achieve.
What is the point in living
in fear all the time?
Why don't you practise law?
You are a lawyer.
I didn't become a lawyer
to go to court, Dad.
Everyone has a law degree
these days to rise politically.
This is the best way to let people
know that I'm no ordinary guy.
I need to be really smart
to win cases in court.
I thought you were
referencing law points.
No. These are books
related to our revolution.
I'm the party's go-to person
at Maanamkara.
I teach everyone now.
I'll get in trouble
if I don't do this, Dad.
What trouble?
I'll have to go to protests
and fights. I'll be hurt.
Nerds like me just have to teach
and order them around.
Close down the factory, attack
the police, stab the capitalist.
I don't have to know anything.
The comrades will do it all.
Is politics all about murder?
What are the basic needs
of a human being?
Food, clothing, shelter.
- Yes. That is correct.
That has changed.
Are there protests now for
food, clothing, and shelter now?
That is true. - There have been
protests for freedom, though.
Actually, only for freedom.
We are not living
in a utopian era.
Revisionists and proletariats
fight about this endlessly.
What is the October Revolution?
What is the Chinese Wall?
Tell me!
I'll give you some books
for you to read, Dad.
We can make the party grow
only we are in power.
That is right. - We can't do it
when we're no longer in power.
We can't grow the party and be
disciplined at the same time.
Yes.
- That is the problem.
It is necessary.
President, what do I do with this?
- Eat it slowly.
Put it out!
You don't know what to do with
a torch and you're serving people!
This must be KRP's dad.
Didn't you understand?
K.G. Pothuwal, our president.
Of course he'd know me.
Everyone knows me here.
What is your name?
- Raghavan Nair.
Mr. Raghavan Nair,
your son is brilliant.
He'll become a great person.
Can I light the torch?
We are here at this time
to give you happy news.
What is that?
We are about to start collecting
funds for our nationwide trip.
That's okay. You can give
him Rs. 5,000 or Rs. 10,000.
That is not why we're here, though.
The leader of the nationwide
tour is Mr. Yaswanth Sahai.
Who?
- Haven't you heard?
INSP's Campaign Joint Secretary
Mr. Yaswanth Sahai.
I haven't heard of him.
Dad was in Tamil Nadu
for a long time.
So what?
He is popular nationwide.
Mr. Nair, please know the names of
our leaders from now on.
Can I light it?
- Get out of here!
Mr. Nair, Mr. Sahai will be staying
in this village for a day.
KRP badly wants him to have
lunch at this house.
Many of us are trying to get
him over to our houses, too.
Mr. Sahai will pick your house
if you are lucky enough.
Dad. Mr. Sahai doesn't
eat from any house.
No. Pray to God that
he eats from here.
I'll try, too. See you, KRP.
- Okay.
Can I light it now?
- To hell with it!
Meeting tomorrow morning..
Prakashan.
- What is it, Dad?
Your leader called you
by another name.
RSP or ASP or something like that.
No, Dad. It's KRP.
That is how I'm known in
political circles now.
Kottappally
Raghavan Nair Prakashan.
That's what KRP means.
Prakashan is a good name.
But, a political leader has to have
a three letter English name.
Look at MGR, NTR, PKB, EMS
AKG. All of them
have three letters.
I'm KRP. Three letters.
So, that's it.
But, you are not helping Anandan,
even though you are a big leader.
Which Anandan?
- Your sister's husband. Who else?
Were you talking about him?
Dad, he and brother
beat up our party members.
Mr. Pothuwal,
our president
has two teeth that are
sticking out. Did you notice?
Those are fake teeth.
Brother-in-law did it.
If I help him,
it'll affect my political career.
You can ask me anything else.
My brother said that our government
would fall in six months.
Ask him to save brother-in-law.
Decide whatever you want.
I'm sad that I spent a lot
of money for your education
and both of you are not working.
Don't worry about me, Dad.
Dad, political activism is
not bad like in the old days.
We don't have any problems
since we are the ruling party now.
Don't you understand, Dad?
You don't need to worry
about anything else now.
We should give Mr. Sahai
an awesome lunch.
Dad, I'll be famous even
in North India after that.
Really?
- Yes.
Believe everything they say.
I don't care.
He'll be famous!
I'd asked you to make them work.
I'll say something.
Our children are smarter than us.
They know better than us.
Do you know?
I removed my shirt
and lit it on fire
to stop a train that
was about to derail.
Railway Minister Seetharamayya
hugged me and told me
'Excellent, Mr. Nair.'
What do I need to do for that?
- Nothing.
I felt that they were right.
So, I came back.
Did you talk to Prabhakaran
about getting married?
I forgot about that.
This is your problem.
You forget what you went for.
We should get him married
before Lathika's wedding.
I am not young like you.
I'm getting older.
I need help around the house.
Bhanu, I'll make sure all three
of our children get married
at the right time.
- Okay.
Yes.
- That's enough.
Here is the bill.
- Okay.
Rs. 360?
- Yes.
Are you paying now?
- What? - It's late, sir.
Pay me when I come tomorrow.
Who pays for all these
newspapers? - Mother does.
Rs. 360 a month?
Stop subscribing to the
newspapers he orders, Dad.
I don't understand how Bhanu
pays this much for newspapers
with the money I used to send her.
Dad,
I don't eat often from here.
I have snacks and tea
at the party office.
We are hardworking citizens.
Mother saves this money
because I don't eat here.
'Interest rates has gone down
in the new budget.'
'The new government
withdrew the heavy taxes'
'enforced by the
previous government.'
'The new government has declared
revolutionary decreases in taxes.'
'The price of onions skyrockets.'
'Kochi. August 17.'
'The price of one sack of onions
was Rs. 70 three months ago.'
'But now the new
government's arrival'
'increased by eight times
and is now Rs. 540.'
'The poor people in the state need
to live without onions.'
'The price of everyday items like
butter, cheese'
'comb and scissors
have been decreased.'
'The prices of powders and needles
were also decreased.'
The public can now eat needles
when they are hungry.
Dad, did you see that there is no
peace and the police are helpless?
The Chief Minister says that the
police are lethargic because
they still believe they work under
the previous government.
It will take some time
to fix everything.
Is there any news
about any protests in schools?
There is no strike today.
There will be a big protest soon.
It will be a protest
to bring a change.
I heard there is an issue between
a bus conductor and a student.
So there is no strike today.
That's bad.
The opposition leader says the
public will regret their decision.
I thought this wouldn't happen.
But it happened.
What happened to your leg?
What happened to my leg
is what you can see.
My whole body is swollen.
I shouldn't complain.
They dealt with me with
good style and technique.
The CI told us to protect the
INSP march if there's an attack.
But the attack wasn't
against the march.
It was against me.
They made all the arrangements.
The march will be enraged
if you start an attack.
They were enraged.
But all the attacks
were against me.
I didn't take it lying down.
I ran with all my strength.
I fell in a canal.
I reached the shore after floating
for seven kilometres.
Are you happy now?
I beat up everyone you
and your party members told me to.
This is the way to behave
with a brother-in-law.
This government will
crumble in six months.
Hey, I have nothing to lose now.
Promotion, CM's security chief!
So many offers were made!
In truth, I came here
to meet you.
Along with everything else
that happened to me
I got a transfer order.
Some remote area
in Kasaragod district.
I don't have the right to say this.
Please, save me if you can.
I'll go now.
Hey, sit down for a while.
I don't have any time.
I have to join tomorrow.
Bhanu, Anandan is here.
What about Latha and children?
Don't ask me about it.
I'll go mad.
Are you leaving?
- Yes. - Do you want some tea?
No.
What happened to your leg?
Nothing happened.
I'm playing a cripple in a play.
I'm rehearsing for it.
We need a theoretical
review on this.
Even though the separatists
and reactionaries
seemed to be opposing each other
we have to assume they had
a mutual understanding.
First, the bourgeois
was waiting for it, too.
That's how we lost the election.
That is the problem.
I don't understand.
It means
Class hegemony
and colonialist ideology
is not a radical change.
Did you understand now?
Why can't you say in easy words
about the reason for our loss?
Why are you confusing us
with colonialism and reactionaries?
Hey, stop it.
You don't understand because
you never come for study class.
Did you understand it?
Then, explain it to me.
Why did we lose?
He is our intellectual spearhead.
Let's just listen to him now.
Hey, Uthaman!
We have allowed democracy
within the party.
That is why we smoke together.
But, that doesn't mean you can
question the seniors of the party.
Do you understand?
Let me tell you one thing.
Tell me.
Our party doesn't
have a foundation. - What?
Our party used to help
even when there was a funeral.
During a wedding, we used to be
there to help from the beginning.
We were the first to call a doctor
take patients to a hospital.
We don't do that anymore.
That's why I say that we
don't have a foundation.
Didn't I tell you to sit down?
Don't you know what will happen
if you behave without discipline?
We'll teach you discipline.
I'll tell you one thing that I
understood from this discussion.
First, INSP.
Our main opponent.
They have a few talented
youth among them.
The public loves them a lot.
We need to break that.
He is correct.
We need to trap them
in some controversy
relating to a woman or pregnancy.
If we make sure the
public despises them
we'll win.
We can get back everything
we lost in six months.
Where is the 'Vada'?
We didn't make it today.
- What?
Didn't you make it?
Don't you know that our main
food is 'Vada', tea and 'Bidi'?
Take it away.
Go and make it.
Obey the party. - Who will point
it out when they make mistakes?
Don't we have leaders for that?
Well, in that.. - I wanted
to talk to you personally.
What is the matter?
You can leave.
This is a personal matter.
Come on, sir.
Well..
What is it?
My family is forcing me a lot.
For what?
They want me to get married.
To get married?
Oh, no!
I see a bright political
future for you.
A family life will be
an obstacle for it.
Father is being stubborn about it.
The party needs leaders
without bindings or burdens.
Don't we have to obey
some of the nature's laws?
You shouldn't.
We should overcome
our biological needs.
Isn't the existence of humanity
based on the family establishment?
Stupidity!
Our fight is against
every establishment.
I have read that a wife
and children will evoke love in us.
Those are useless principles.
Learn to love your fellow
human beings and the common man.
I'll be frank.
Our party doesn't approve
of marriage at all.
Then why did you get married?
I regret it now.
Why can't you leave your wife now?
We are discussing you now.
You say one thing
and do another thing.
You shout that there
is no God or religion.
Then, you hide your
face and go to the temple.
Who?
You.
I have seen you going
to the temple every day.
How did you see me?
I go to the temple in secret, too.
In that case,
let's keep it between us.
You can get married if you want.
You should be strict
about one thing. - What is it?
You should marry a girl who will
respect our party and its ideology.
I'll make sure of that.
Then all the best.
- Thank you.
See her well.
Don't forget what I told you.
Don't talk about the party.
I have told that you are a lawyer.
I don't need to lie about anything.
What is it?
Nothing. We were discussing
some legal matters. - Oh!
No.
I'm a member of the Revolutionary
Democratic Party.
He does that just for fun.
- For fun?
The party is my life and soul.
I have to ask her few things.
Are you ready to work for
the freedom of the working class?
Tell me.
No. I'll make you ready.
I need to test your
social awareness.
Have you read the book called
'Capitalist Con Salim'?
Or 'Downtrodden: A Question Mark'
written by Aldous Huxley?
How about 'Das Kapital'?
Don't you read?
- She does.
All of us read the novels that
get published in magazines.
Is that all?
Okay. What is your favourite novel?
Which one is it?
Well..
- Well?
Tell him.
I liked 'Hawa Beach' the most.
'Hawa Beach'?
What kind of beach is that?
It might be some foreign beach.
She likes Kottayam Pushpanathan
and Mathew Mattam a lot.
What do you mean by 'like'?
That's okay.
I have some conditions.
There shouldn't be any
celebrations for the marriage.
A simple function
in our party office.
We'll exchange red
garlands with each other.
After that, our party members
will loudly recite our party motto.
After that, a glass of lime juice.
That's it.
I'll in hiding
for most of the time.
In exile.
Haven't you read Mr. Thoppil
Bhasi's 'Olivile Ormakal'?
My life will be similar to that.
INSP is hunting us.
I might be arrested sometimes.
A revolutionary's wife should
be capable of handling anything.
You might have to face bullets.
You will need to
face it with courage.
You may go inside, dear.
Come with me, Achuthan Nair.
- Okay.
Did you bring a crazy man
for my daughter's husband?
Forgive me.
I didn't expect this much.
If you don't take him away now
I'll beat you up.
- Oh, no! We'll go now..
Get up!
Let's go.
I didn't get a response
for my instructions.
It will be a problem
if we wait for a response.
But still, we..
- Just get up!
I'll tell you on the way.
We shouldn't stay here anymore.
I don't see any issue with that.
Isn't it better to say
everything before marriage?
Is this how you say everything?
They got scared when he talked
and jail and bullets.
I'm lucky that
the father didn't hit me.
Don't send me for
such errands anymore.
How can you say that?
- I can't do it.
Both of them talk too much, Father.
Who are you talking about?
Prabhakaran and Prakashan.
The sad part is
they do more than that.
You shouldn't talk like
this about your brothers.
How can I not say it?
The other day, Prabhakaran told me
to go with RDP's march.
He threatened to hit me
when I said no.
Is that so?
Well, I'll plough it.
Give it to me.
Where did you get the seeds from?
Bhanu had it with her.
It's better to buy it from
the agricultural department.
Well, Raghavan
there is a smart officer
in the agricultural department.
Let's ask him about the
potential of this land.
Though he is short-tempered,
he loves agriculture.
He is very dedicated.
Do you see that?
This is not manure.
This is pesticide.
You should spray it on
the leaves, not on the roots.
Spray it.
- Okay.
They have powdery mildew.
We have to mix one gram of
karathane in one litre of water.
In case of cutworms
you have to spray cythion
and 10 percent CP together.
Even pesticides had
unwanted types in it.
Pusa Sawani.
The immunity power was great.
Didn't I give it to you once?
Yes, you did.
- You can leave now. I'll come.
He doesn't know how
to do it properly.
Soil test is not a problem for me.
You won't have to send it to a lab.
I'll say it at one glance
about the water content,
nitrogen percent and all that.
We'll decide the
next step after that.
What is there in the lab?
Machines.
They can make mistakes.
But, I never make a mistake.
Now the lab sends their samples
to me when their machines fail.
I'll send the result
within minutes.
Even the department
is scared of me.
They call me
'Soil Udayabhanu' in secret.
I am happy when I hear it.
'Soil Udayabhanu'.
Isn't it good?
Okay. I'll see you.
What a man!
He is much more than that.
Here is your box.
Keys.
When is your train?
It's at 10:45 AM.
I couldn't clean
everything properly.
Oh, that's okay.
Just don't forget about us.
- What are you saying?
We might get
transferred here again.
We'll come back to the same house.
- Okay.
Children, tell her goodbye.
- Bye.
Your items must have reached
there, isn't it? - Yes..
The kids got admission in
Kasaragod school already.
They already missed
a lot of classes.
Will Anandan come
to the railway station?
Of course, he will.
I'll see you, Ammootty.
Do we know anything
about Kasaragod?
We have to travel 20 kms
from Kasaragod, it seems.
We'll be late if I keep talking.
Get in.
Stop it.
Don't get in.
Stop!
Oh, no!
Hey, stop.
Stop the vehicle.
- What is it?
Oh, I would have died!
- What is it?
I was racing with the wind
to catch you before you left.
Why?
- They transferred me to Parassala.
Oh, my God!
How did you get transferred again?
We have to tolerate all this.
Oh, no!
Anandan. - Yes?
I already sent our belongings.
Where?
- To Kasaragod.
Damn!
Couldn't you send it later?
Won't we have to get
our children's TCs?
Yes. We have to get TCs from there.
Okay. - We have to get
admissions in Parassala.
We have to make
arrangements for living there.
I'll go mad like this.
These politicians are wreaking
havoc with my life!
Let the sky fall on their heads!
Hey, move.
Move to the side.
Hold that end.
- Go cut that one down.
Do it.
- Lift it slowly.
There.
Hold it from there.
From there. - Hey, Govindan!
- What is this, Prakashan?
Cut the leaves.
What is this?
Mr. Nair, your luck is improving.
Don't you know about the party
meeting in Thiruvananthapuram?
I want to know
why you cut this tree.
Wasn't it a blooming tree?
This is just a tree for you.
But, this is a flag post for us.
- Yes.
It is the post that
will hold our flag.
Arrange the other side over there.
- Okay.
This tree will be blessed from
Thiruvananthapuram to Kasaragod.
This is called a flag march.
Take these seeds to our office.
- Okay.
You are lucky we chose
the tree from your land.
It took many years
to grow this tree.
How could you cut
this down in a minute?
Father, we lost only a tree.
We'll get a new India in return.
Yes. One India, one people!
That is our motto.
One India, one people!
That is our motto.
Don't slip.
It'll fall on your feet.
Leave.
How are you, Sister?
Nothing much!
The kids wanted to see you.
Isn't it?
- Come fast.
We have to finish it.
- I'll be right there.
Are you two happy now?
Go and give him a kiss.
- No. Kiss me later..
I'll be right back.
- Wait there, my dear.
Let me see you properly.
Oh, no!
You are getting tanned a lot.
You lost a lot of weight, too.
I can see your bones.
Isn't mother giving
you food properly?
Our mother!
She only makes 'Sambar' and curd.
She'll never change it.
Come to my house.
I'll give you some meat.
- We'll do it some other time.
Well, didn't you go to Kasaragod?
It's better to not talk about it.
He was transferred to
Parassala as soon as
he took charge in Kasaragod.
- Is that so?
Hey!
Like you didn't know it.
Why are you troubling your
sister and brother-in-law?
Who? Me?
- Your party.
Have him posted somewhere here.
Hey, I can't help you in that.
Did you notice our party president?
Mr. K.G. Pothuwal.
Did you see his front teeth?
They are fake.
Anandan broke them.
That was a mistake..
- I understood.
Tell him to apologise to Pothuwal.
He did it a lot.
- He'll have to do a lot more.
Won't you help your sister?
No, Sister.
You'll never reach
anywhere in life!
This is the problem.
- What is it?
Kisses for me,
getting worried about my health
healthy food!
What were you saying?
Yes.
It is an act.
I had to beg in front
of idiots like you.
There is a better idiot than me.
My brother-in-law.
Go and beg him.
I'm not answering this now.
We only have this march
to look forward to now.
After that, we have
the Co-operative Bank.
They ruled the bank
when they were in power.
We'll rule it when we have power.
We'll put our people back in
the bank with police protection.
Isn't that enough?
We have to do it, sir.
Does anyone have to teach me
how to play the game?
Should anyone teach a fish to swim?
- No.
About that issue..
It's him.
He was transferred because of me.
I don't understand
what he is planning.
Do one thing.
Give me security by
forming a circle around me.
Okay. - Any police officer will
have bombs with them. - It's true.
You should protect me
with your lives.
Form a circle.
- Okay.
You don't have to hold it there.
Move forward like this.
Greetings!
- Oh, no! - What is this?
Please save me.
I apologised to you
thrice before this.
I apologised to you when I knew
your party was going to win.
I apologised again when you won.
I apologised when
the cabinet was announced.
Now, I'm being
transferred everywhere.
Yes.
I want to see you roaming
around Kerala like a lost soul.
I didn't shoot you because you are
our party member's brother-in-law.
Rascal!
Yes, I'm a rascal.
Get lost!
Sir..
Move!
Sir..
I'll beg you.
- Hey!
Do you remember
that I came to the station
for lots of favours?
Do you remember hitting
and throwing me out? - Yes.
I tell you now.
Get out! Get out! Get out!
This whole area has
laterite content in the soil.
Kerala, Tamil Nadu,
Andhra and West Bengal
have the same type of soil.
Why didn't you do crop rotation?
You could have planted
bananas and tapioca.
You could have grown
other vegetables too.
This soil is good for everything.
He just came back from Tamil Nadu.
And it's only been three
months since he bought it.
Is three months a
short time period?
We can grow okra at any time.
It will grow in five days.
It produces fast, too.
Why didn't you grow that?
At least,
you could have grown spinach.
He didn't have to travel
all the way from Tamil Nadu.
Wasn't there anyone at home?
There are so many workers here.
You have to grow a spinach called
'Kannara Local'.
Land should never sit idle.
God will curse anyone
who lets a grown woman
be single or a land go barren.
Do you understand?
Father, here is the tea.
Whom did she call father?
It should be Raghavan.
That means she is the daughter
of this land's owner.
What is she doing now?
She failed her
pre-university exams.
Oh, she could have
grown the vegetables.
Give me the tea. - Wait.
I'm not done with soil testing.
Is it mango?
- Yes. - Give it to me.
You bought it from
the market, didn't you? - Yes.
These mangoes
are called 'Chongatheni'.
You find this a lot in
Bandurutti, Tamil Nadu.
Yes.
Why can't we grow it here?
Can we do all this
in such a small area?
We should make it happen.
It's very sweet.
Come on.
Let's continue with the testing.
This layer of soil
has more acidity.
The coconut trees here
will need lime.
The nitrogen content is low.
You'll need urea, too.
Did you see this?
This soil has more
alkaline content.
Manure with nitrate
content is crucial.
Anyway, you'll have to
get new coconut saplings.
I'll look for them in Balaramapuram
and Kuttiady.
We have some in our house, Father.
Let it be there.
I'll bring fresh ones.
You should plant that.
What is there to laugh
if someone slips and falls?
I'll turn this land into a garden.
Haven't you heard the song,
"Soil in Kerala reaps gold"? - Yes.
I envision a garden
with coconut trees
mangoes, spinach,
brinjal, curry leaves and so on.
I'll see you.

Police station.
A brawl?
- Where?
Oh? Dead?
Okay.
Ismail. - Sir.
Thapa. - Sir.
Start the jeep.
- Okay.
There is a brawl happening.
Somebody died.
The police are here.
Move away.
Come fast.
Move away.
- Don't push.
Move away..
Move away, everyone..
Come here.
Who was involved in the fight?
Sir, I don't belong
to any political party.
That was not my question.
The incident happened here
and you are an eyewitness.
RDP workers came here to stick
some posters in my shop.
A man named Uthaman
and some others. - Then?
I didn't allow it.
They started threatening me.
I stood fast.
Uthaman came back half an hour
ago with a gang of 15 people.
Even then, I didn't allow them.
Then they started
abusing me like anything.
By then, some INSP workers
came and supported me.
Then, the fight was between them.
My shop was filled
with customers at that time.
The brawl erupted just then.
When this person fell dead,
everyone ran away.
Who is this person?
Our problem is not
who that person is.
We need to make people believe
that he was a member of our party.
I know the deceased man.
He is not involved in any party.
Mr. Anandan, have you gone nuts?
I became like this
after associating with you.
Let him support any party.
This is a golden
opportunity for us.
We need to take advantage of this.
- How?
What if we showcase him
as our party member?
What?
- He would be a martyr for us.
Our martyr, who was brutally
murdered by INSP.
With this, we can come back
strongly after the election defeat.
We will arrange a procession with
his body wrapped in an RDP flag.
That would shake the whole village.
The villagers won't
spare INSP workers.
I am so proud of you.
You have thought ahead of me
in this matter.
Okay, sir.
We don't have much time.
We need to get that dead body
as soon as possible.
Somebody get me our party flag.
For that, we need to go
to our office. - Idiot!
Why can't you keep
one with you always?
We could use it whenever
we find a martyr.
Okay, quickly bring a flag.
- Come fast.
Stop..
It's turning out to be
a huge problem. - Problem?
Is there another brawl?
Let's go back.
It's not a brawl.
They are trying to portray him
as their martyr.
It would harm us really badly
if he becomes their martyr.
Actually, which party does
the deceased belong to?
As he was dead,
I couldn't ask him.
Damn!
- Whatever happens
we shouldn't let RDP
get the dead body.
We will proclaim that the deceased
was a member of INSP.
KRP, hang a black flag on our car.
- We don't have one.
A black cloth will even do.
Am I always
carrying a black cloth around?
KRP, we don't have time.
My umbrella.
Hold this.
This would do the job.
- I bought it only yesterday.
Not in this situation.
KRP, go ahead.
- Okay.
My dear friend Gopalankutty Nair!
This shouldn't have happened.
His name is Chathukutty Nair.
- What?
It's Chathukutty Nair.
- Sorry.
My dear friend Chathukutty Nair!
This shouldn't have happened.
He was a brave member of INSP.
Don't leave us alone here.
- Move aside.
No, sir. We have worked together
for INSP for the past 20 years.
We were really close
to each other. Isn't it?
- Yes.
I asked you to move aside. - I'm
the district president of INSP.
I don't care.
Get lost!
The home ministry belongs
to our party. - So?
We need to conduct a mourning
procession with his body. - Move!
Move away, everyone.
- Don't touch our martyr.
Move away..
- Yes, move away..
Bring our flag.
Let me cover him with it.
All hail our martyr!
Don't you dare touch our dead body!
- No, this is our dead body!
No, it's the body of the
deceased person.
Inspector, it's better
to kill us than doing this.
How dare he wrap an
INSP martyr in an RDP flag?
Move away..
If you touch our flag, there
will be more martyrs. - Let it be.
We don't support
non-violence anymore.
Really?
- Move away. Thrash him.
Thrash him black and blue.
Don't you dare touch our body.
- Leave me.
Hey, you!
- It's INSP!
Kill him!
Move away, everyone..
Keep the body inside the ambulance.
Our mourning procession.
We are the ruling party.
You can decide whose body
it is after the post-mortem.
Stop police atrocities!
- Stop police atrocities!
Stop police atrocities!
- Stop police atrocities!
Stop police atrocities!
- Stop police atrocities!
Hand over our dead body to us!
- Hand over our dead body to us!
Hand over our dead body to us!
- Hand over our dead body to us!
Long live RDP!
- Long live RDP!
Long live RDP!
- Long live RDP!
Long live RDP!
- Long live RDP!
Let's go to the hospital!
- Let's go to the hospital!
Let's go to the hospital!
- Let's go to the hospital!
Hand over our dead body to us!
- Hand over our dead body to us!
'All our dear villagers
are invited to attend'
'a public meeting which
will be held today'
'at Maanamkara Junction
to pay tribute'
'to the brave INSP member
Mr. Chathukutty Nair'
'who was brutally
killed by the RDP.'
Some RDP members are
waiting in the hospital
to wrap him in their flag.
But, we have made all
arrangements to wrap him up
with our flag in the
mortuary itself.
The body would only come out
of the mortuary in INSP colours.
What?
Yes.
You only have to do this
much as a minister.
Call for a press conference
and express your shock on
the demise of our member.
We will take care of the rest.
If possible,
try to visit this place.
What?
Are you busy?
There isn't anything more important
than getting a martyr in our party.
No. The culprits are in hiding.
Okay. Okay.
Okay, sir.
Long live Mother India.
Now, we won't even have
anything, let alone the body.
When not in power,
the party itself is useless.
They have charged the case against
11 members of our party.
That's okay.
At least, we got left out.
My God, how long will
they remain in hiding?
God?
What are you saying?
Our party doesn't believe in God.
Sorry.
By mistake..
They can live in hiding as long
as they want. It won't affect us.
We don't need them now.
That's right.
There isn't any election coming.
How will they survive?
- They will survive somehow.
Even if they don't return,
it won't affect our party.
Please don't say that.
- Then, what should I say?
When I am trying to enhance
our party's image..
Tea and snacks.
- Please come..
We will find a way out
after having tea and snacks.
Don't wait for them.
Both your sons have got something
to fight for the next few days.
Actually, which party
did the deceased person belong to?
He didn't support any party.
He was a good human being.
Both parties are trying
to put him in their colours.
I hope my kids will be fine.
This is what happens when
you start serving the public.
You need to work continuously.
So, my sons have
to be there to solve
all the problems in this
area. Isn't it?
I am leaving. I think
that would be the better option.
She is alone there.
- You can leave after dinner.
No, I don't want to have dinner.
What a person you are!
- Hello, please come.
What do you mean?
You didn't even turn up to
enquire about those saplings.
You need to have some interest
if you want to do farming.
It's not that.
Are the saplings available?
Unfortunately,
they're not available.
It's in season now.
What is happening here?
- Fertilizers for the coconut tree.
Really?
- What happened?
It's better for you
to return to Tamil Nadu.
Sir, coconut trees need potash.
How much potash
does this ash contain?
Please tell me.
In a kilogram of ash, there would
be a maximum of 12 grams of potash.
It is nowhere enough.
We are looking for
immediate results.
For the time being,
we can use urea
superphosphate and feldspar powder.
People usually put ash and dung
as fertilizers for coconut trees.
Are you trying to teach me?
Well, as we couldn't
find saplings..
You had told me that you
have some with you. - Yes.
Let me check it. If they're
productive ones, we can use that.
Bhanu.
- Yes?
My wife's name is Bhanumathi.
- My name is Udayabhanu.
I know but I just forgot.
Bhanu, prepare some tea.
We are going upstairs.
- Okay.
Dear, bring the ladder.
- Make it fast.
Be careful. I have already
fallen here. - Okay.
Where is the ladder?
That's right.
It was kept here.
I had seen it even yesterday.
I don't need a ladder for this.
I am an expert in climbing
trees and walls.
We will get the ladder.
- It's okay.
What is happening here? Won't
you allow me to think peacefully?
Who are you?
- Well, the coconut..
Are you a coconut? - He is from
the agriculture department.
Is he farming in the attic?
A coconut sampling..
- To select it..
No, I won't allow you to go there.
Who is this guy?
- My elder son.
Prabhakaran.
- I don't think he is normal.
What is his problem
in me climbing up there?
Don't climb.. Dad..
- It's okay. - I won't allow it.
Once I decide on something,
I hate backing down.
I am telling you to come down.
Be careful.
Come down.
- Hold tightly.
Search every nook and corner.
This is where he plans everything.
- Come.
It's kept next to the gunny bag.
Oh, no!
Police!
Oh, no..
He must be up there!
Oh, my God!
Oh, no..
Catch him!
Stop there.
Oh, God! Run!
It's the police!
Go through that side.
Stop there! - Sir.
Stop there!
Stop!
I thought it was
some kind of animal.
How did he reach up there?
Did you catch him?
- No, they escaped.
What kind of an officer are you?
- I will have you transferred.
Mind your words.
Sir, who was that guy?
Don't you know?
Are you trying to fool us
after hiding a murder suspect,
rascal?
Sir, I..
- Isn't this your house?
Yes.
- You are under arrest.
Don't arrest him. He is the father
of one of our members.
Stop it. I don't care
about getting transferred.
Get inside the jeep.
- Dad.
Sir. He didn't do
anything wrong.
He is innocent.
The court will decide that.
Get inside!
As the maker of modern India..
Studying when his dad is in jail!
With his death an epoch
in our country..
Stop shouting so loudly.
Stop it.
Please read it softly.
'son of Motilal Nehru
was born on..'
What happened? - He needs
to spend tonight in jail.
We will go with the
lawyer in the morning.
Where is Bhanumathi?
She has been lying down since then.
She hasn't had anything until now.
We shouldn't allow that.
Have a seat.
What is this?
Is he the first person
to get arrested?
They are not going to kill him.
Did you meet him?
Of course, I did.
I was with him until now.
He has asked me to tell you
not to worry about anything.
He came here to lead
a peaceful retired life.
So what?
There is nothing to
worry about jail.
In a way
jail is a much better
place to live than over here.
If you don't believe me..
Please go and tell her.
- What should I say?
I cannot see her in tears.
If I see her crying,
even I'd start crying.
Just say something to console her.
Is that enough?
- Yes. - Okay.
There is nothing to worry.
Happiness and sadness are like
two sides of a coin.
If you are sad today, tomorrow
you would be happy. That's life.
So, please don't worry.
You shouldn't worry, either.
See you.
Please come.
Didn't you allow him
to even wear his clothes?
That's not allowed
inside the lockup.
If the prisoner commits suicide
using his clothes
I would be the one locked up.
Sir, his dress.
- Give it to him.
Mr. Nair, please have a seat.
You were a criminal
yesterday, but not anymore.
In the post-mortem report
it was clear that the person
didn't die because of an injury.
Yes, he died
because of a heart attack.
Mr. Chathukutty Nair had had
three to four attacks previously.
His body didn't have
a single fingerprint on it.
All the accused are not
accused anymore.
You must have had in
your horoscope that
you should spend one night in jail.
Mr. Nair, please sign here.
So, you abused me
yesterday for no reason.
That's part of my duty.
To abuse someone? - If you want,
you can abuse me once in return.
See you.
- Is that necessary?
Dad.. - Of course, did you
think I was? Your mom?
I was about to come
to the police station.
Why? To tell them
to keep me inside jail?
Why are you talking like this?
- Then, what should he say?
Did either of you turn up
to meet him when he was in jail?
This is what misunderstanding is.
I was working for his release
inside the party office.
I was giving the orders.
Now see the result.
Dad, we are the ruling party now.
If we publicly enter the police
station, the opposition
would accuse us, saying that we
are trying to use our influence.
That is the reason I was
working in the background.
It's because of your elder son
that you got arrested.
Are you not angry about it?
- No, I am happy about it.
I could spend a night in
jail because of my kids.
You can put the blame upon brother.
How can you blame me?
Who accused Uthaman
and his friends
with the charge of murder
by influencing the police?
Scoundrels!
It was proven that he
died of a heart attack.
These idiots wanted
to wrap that body
with their party flag saying
that it was their martyr.
Don't you need that body anymore?
No, we don't need it.
You can keep it
with all you idiots.
Mind your words.
- Get lost!
Come to the junction.
I will show you.
Don't you dare do
anything at the junction.
Dad, I tried to save
an innocent person.
Unfortunately,
you had to pay the price for it.
This is our system. We are
living in a very cruel society.
I hope you understand our
law and order system.
Aren't you in the opposition?
Then, why didn't you
come to the station?
Dad, you are not
any ordinary father.
You are a revolutionary's father.
Do you know about the fathers
in Vietnam and Cuba?
Warriors who took guns
from their son's ashes!
There are no son's ashes here!
This is our family matter.
We were planning to attack
the police station
if you weren't released. - Oh, no!
That is too much.
Armed revolution is not new to us!
Mr. Madhavan, close the shop.
What happened? - INSP members
are coming to collect money.
Oh, God!
They are asking for
Rs. 1,000 and more.
They are abusing those
who don't give them money. Run.
Let me inform others.
- Where are they?
We'll make the sales tax officers
raid this shop.
More that Rs. 500 is..
- You have to donate Rs. 1,000.
This is for an All-India march.
It's not some silly campaign.
It is Yaswanth Sahai's
All-India march.
Give us the money.
Have you written the receipt?
- For half. - That's all right.
He is arrogant.
- Yes. - Come on.
Wasn't this open when we came?
- Yes, I was thinking the same.
He closed it early.
Let's look at it later.
Come.
Should we go in during office time?
Should we come
after the office is closed?
We are the ruling party.
We can go in at any time.
Govindankutty. - Yes.
- Go to the back door.
James, stand by the gate.
Yes.
- We should not let anyone escape.
Okay. Go on..
- Come on, KRP.
Call all the employees in here.
- Sit down.
INSP District President
K G Pothuwal is here.
Who is he?
- It's me.
You might have heard about
Yashwant Sahai's All-India march.
This is its fund collection.
We have decided to collect
half of your monthly salaries.
Why should we pay for his march?
Seems like he is new.
- Yes.
No, I am old.
Around 30 years old.
That's my age.
Shall we call Thiruvananthapuram
and transfer him?
Transfer me to Anavattakurishi
if possible.
That area is very fertile.
- We don't have time to talk.
Yashwant Sahai's Indian March
has started from Mumbai.
Oh, no!
I never heard.
Why is he marching for?
To unite the detached
multi-lingual people
in India and strengthen
the unity of our country.
This man called Sahai..
- Man?
Is he an animal?
If he marches across the country
will our unity get strengthened?
- Don't ask silly questions.
We have numerous unemployed
youth in our country.
Will this march help them?
Will the homeless get houses?
Will the hungry get food?
You're crossing the line.
No.
I have seen many like you.
You run around with receipt
books for silly reasons.
Most of the people
pay you out of fear.
You may cause trouble.
I won't pay for such
useless things.
Mister, we are the ruling party.
You will regret this.
I never promised anyone that I
will keep this position forever.
I am strong.
I will work.
Shall we call
the agriculture minister?
Go ahead.
Tell him
that a brave officer is here.
I am getting angry.
Cool down, KRP.
Cool down.
Let's see this officially.
I will take care of you.
I will. For sure.
- Come on.
He will take care of you.
- Okay. - Okay.
His Yashwant Sahai!
'The All-India march led by
Yashwant Sahai across India'
'has reached Maanamkara.'
'To encourage the Indian citizens'
'to strengthen the
unity of our country'
'Yashwant Sahai is here.'
'The favourite leader of
the country, Yashwant Sahai'
'is travelling..'
- Make sure
that you take the photo
of me welcoming him.
Don't miss it.
- '...to ensure the citizens.'
Here he is. - 'Our favourite leader
Yashwant Sahai is here.'
Hail Yashwant Sahai!
- Hail Yashwant Sahai!
Hail Yashwant Sahai..
- Take the photo.
Hail Yashwant Sahai.
- Don't put the garland.
He might not like it. I'll do it.
- Hail Yashwant Sahai..
Hail Yashwant Sahai..
- Take the photo.
Hail Yashwant Sahai..
- What are you doing?
Hail Yashwant Sahai..
Light the crackers.
- Crackers!
Don't worry.
It's the crackers.
Come on..
Make it fast..
Do it properly.
Please move.
It should be ready in 30 minutes.
- Okay.
He will have lunch at 12:30 pm.
Done. - He will have
gas trouble if he eats late.
Okay.
- Chop it fast.
What are you doing, Mother?
Why don't you do something
to help?
I meant you, too.
Don't make a crowd.
Let him breathe.
Move aside..
Move..
Please stand outside.
Let us discuss political issues.
Please, get out.
Go on.
Please.
Go.
Move aside.
How can we do so?
Naariyel Paani.
What?
- Naariyel Paani.
What?
Bring tender coconut
water for me to drink.
What is he asking?
- He is showing this.
He might want alcohol.
God!
Before this crowd?
You idiot!
Bring Naariyel Paani.
He wants to drink.
Do you want alcohol?
Half bottle or full bottle?
Half bottle?
- Or full bottle?
No?
Do you want McDowell or Honeybee?
We usually drink McDowell.
Shut up, idiot.
I want Naariyel Paani.
What should I do?
Does anyone what he is asking for?
Naari means woman.
Oh, God!
We don't have women.
Ram!
- Do you mean rum?
Ram!
It's not that.
Don't we have a single
educated member in our party?
Does anyone know what he's saying?
Anyone?
- Tender coconut water!
What?
- Tender coconut water.
Tender coconut water?
- Yes.
Why didn't you say so earlier?
Do you mean tender coconut water?
- Yes.
That's it.
Go and bring some tender coconuts.
Go.
- Okay..
Go on.
Where are you going?
Can't you see me?
I didn't see.
What is this, Father?
What are you doing here when
something great is happening there?
I went to jail since I am the house
owner. I can't take anymore.
The members are asking
me where my father is.
Tell them that he is here.
- You are the reason he is here.
Do you know that he's INSP campaign
joint secretary and leader?
Is he? Then you must go.
I am not going. - Don't embarrass
me in front of them, Father.
I am begging you.
You have to come.
In that case,
you have to go now.
I am scared after that incident.
- This has nothing to do with that.
This is a national thing. Come.
- Yes, it is.
Aren't you his best friend?
- Yes.
And about the same age?
- Yes.
Stop mocking me.
Come on.
Have you all got it?
He is my father.
Come on.
Come.
Give him another.
Unfold your 'Dhoti'.
Introduce father.
Okay.
Why not?
Touch his feet
and get his blessings.
Make it fast.
Others will come
after he finishes this.
You won't get the chance again.
He is a great man.
Do it.
You won't get another chance.
Why did you bring me here?
Don't talk.
Don't throw it.
I'll get it later.
Who is he?
He is not wearing Khadi.
He is Prakashan's father.
Prakash?
- K. R. Prakashan.
What?
The owner of this house.
The head.
Like the president.
The president of this house.
President of this house.
Translate it in Hindi.
He is staring at me.
My second language was Malayalam.
My father.
What?
- My father.
Who are you?
What do you want?
He wants..
- Shut up.
I thought people in Kerala
were intelligent.
But, I have realised
that I was wrong.
Our national language is Hindi.
Learn Hindi.
Else, no one will be saved.
Those who don't know Hindi
will not be given jobs
by our government.
And remember this.
Anyone who comes to Mumbai
will be treated badly.
Understood?
Highest literacy rate!
Idiots!
Is lunch ready?
- It's there.
Go there.
- Okay.
Whatever you say,
this is a shame to RDP.
How will we face our followers?
Ideology should be in deeds
and not only in words.
How can I stop it
if I don't know about it?
That is a tactful excuse.
How can you solve global issues
when you can't solve ones at home?
Aren't you the eldest son?
Why didn't your family
discuss with you
about giving
this scoundrel such a feast?
His own family doesn't respect
him like we do.
Rs. 1,500 at the grocery store.
Rs. 500 for vegetables.
Rs. 400 for mutton.
Rs. 425 for fish.
Milk, curd..
Rs. 4,200 altogether.
Did Prakashan give this to you?
Who else would?
He told me
to pay the bills tomorrow.
God!
What does this mean?
Why should we worry?
Didn't our famous son do it?
His father will pay.
There won't be a coconut
harvest for the next six months.
They had it all.
Our tape recorder is missing.
- What?
When I looked for it to study.. No.
I looked everywhere.
It's not here.
They took that along
with the clock, too.
The box in which I used to keep
small change is also missing.
Are they thieves?
Thieves are better!
How is it now?
Why are you silent?
- Did he ask my permission?
You should have said no.
Who am I?
I asked you who I am.
- I will tell you.
Prabhakaran Kottappalli.
- Shut up.
Let this man answer.
- Prabha!
No, I am taking that question back.
Are you my father?
- What did you say?
I don't want the eldest
son's position for show.
If I don't have the
right of the eldest son..
Don't make me a rubber stamp.
What have I done to you?
Today, my colleagues treated me
like they treat a bourgeois.
The lower class members,
who won't even speak
in the party's study class,
abused me.
Giving a feast to a thief
in my house..
Oh, that!
Did you ask me?
Tell me!
I will rectify this.
What will you do?
- Watch me.
Do you know why this happened?
Because you are spineless.
- Prabha!
Get a spine
made of rubber, at least.
I told you I would rectify it.
What matters the most to me
is my public image.
Our house will be
Maanamkara area's
Revolutionary Democratic Party
headquarters henceforth.
Hail the labour movement!
Brother, have you heard?
What? - Prabha is making our house
his party headquarters.
What?
- He raised a flag in the yard.
Do you have insurance?
Get one for a large amount soon.
If the situation holds,
you won't have to pay for long.
Famous athletes and sportsmen
take insurance for each body part.
Any type is beneficial for
parents with such kids.
If you had insured your head,
you would have got good money.
Why are you silent?
Are you angry?
Elders used to say that a father
should act like one.
That means you shouldn't
pamper kids a lot.
Why are you staring?
You might be thinking who I am
to advise you. Okay, I won't.
Father!
- Don't touch him.
Keep a distance.
There are four stitches.
Does it hurt?
No, it won't. That is the best
part of a head injury.
It won't be painful.
What are you asking?
They didn't sedate him.
He was crying.
Here.
This is the card.
Give these thrice a day.
This, twice a day.
Follow up in two days.
Don't ask him anything.
He has vowed to remain silent.
He is not speaking.
It may be he's still in shock.
Take him in.
I will return
after watering the cows.
This won't do.
It should be 25 cm deep.
- Okay. - The breadth is correct.
Sreedharan.
- Yes.
The pit should be square.
- Okay.
Plough the soil well.
- Okay.
Great!
No one hasn't come here
until now.
It seems like I am the
one who should do it.
Father is not well.
What happened?
- He fell.
There are stitches on his head.
Oh, no.
I didn't know.
Wait.
I will come with you.
Did he slip
or trip against something?
Well..
- Yes?
I didn't see him fall.
- That is not necessary.
Will anyone announce it
before falling?
Haven't you asked him how he fell?
Is this how you should act
when your father falls down?
He slipped and hit the flower pot.
- Why didn't you say that?
No wonder you failed
pre-university exams.
You don't know
how to answer questions.
I am not the only one who failed.
Only 41 per cent
of students passed.
Oh!
So you have the majority.
Why didn't you retry?
How will you live
without a job these days?
How can you live
with only your husband's salary?
I am not married.
You have a good sense of humour.
Anyone else would believe you.
I am not joking.
I am single.
Don't say the same joke again.
Okay?
What happened?
The servants for work..
- They are digging.
How did you fall?
It is not serious.
Give him tea.
No, thank you.
Which is your birth star?
- Why?
Tell me.
- 'Rohini'.
That's it.
It's a bad time for you.
'Thulam', 'Vrichikam',
'Dhanu', 'Makaram'.
It is bad until mid 'Makaram'.
Do you know astrology?
I am not joking.
It will go bad even if you sit
idle to avoid accidents.
For instance,
the roof brick might fall.
Or a snake will bite you
if you go out.
It is a very bad time.
Where is your house?
Your home town?
My home town!
That is a difficult question.
- Don't you have one?
Not that. In a sense,
Kerala is our own town.
God's ways are mystifying!
He gave me a job to
take care of agricultural land.
But, he didn't give me any land.
Nor any relatives.
You might ask me
if I came into being on my own.
No.
My only family was my mother.
She passed away when I
was in 10th grade.
My little hut was torn down
to build a canal.
I studied hard
with the compensation money I got.
My mother wanted me to have a job.
She used to pay my fees
by working as a manual labourer.
I get a mental picture
when I think about her.
I never used to pay
my fees on time.
I got a lot of fines.
Before being kicked out
from the class
I would be made to stand
in the class for the whole day.
That evening,
in her dirty and muddy dress
my mother would come to
the class and call me.
Udaya!
She would give me the money
like she won a lottery.
I should leave.
The workers might mess up.
I have been standing
here for half an hour.
Did you call me to show
how cows eat grass?
Tell me what you want to say.
- Wait.
The start should be good.
My teacher used to say
that the first interconnection
is the best interconnection.
Interconnection?
- Yes.
First impression
is the best impression. - I know.
I want to talk about a connection.
- What connection?
I will say it openly.
- Go on.
I am interested in this, too.
If you think why
a mere neighbour is saying this..
Are you just a neighbour for us?
Have I ever counted you so?
- Then I won't stretch it out.
What do you think about marrying
Agriculture Officer Udayabhanu?
Even though he is a very
talkative person
when he heard this
he felt the same nervousness
as you are facing now.
He told me to ask your opinion
secretly
and if you're not interested,
to put an end to this here.
We have still not informed
Mr. Raghavan.
The opinion of the ones getting
married is more important.
What is your opinion?
Tell me without hesitating.
I.. What should I say?
That's more than enough.
Which means you have no problem
and I can ask your parents.
So, you are amenable to this.
I will take care of the rest.
You can leave.
But I.. - I understood, dear.
You can leave.
But.. - Oh, God!
Stop worrying and leave, dear.
Don't stop your work.
- Actually..
The front yard was very dirty.
So, I thought of cleaning
it myself. - Good.
We should try to do everything
ourselves.
When I used to stay alone
in my quarters
I have done all this and more.
Please come.
Let's sit inside. - Okay.
You can sit here. - No.
This is more comfortable.
Shall I get you tea?
That would be trouble for you.
- Not at all.
It's all right.
I just had one.
This embarrassment can be avoided
when marriage proposals
are discussed between parents.
That was my main problem.
That's why I sent Achuthan Nair.
I know that was not the right way.
But, I was also scared if I deserve
to marry your daughter.
Don't even think so.
Genuinely speaking, this is my
daughter's good fortune.
We all like you a lot.
Haven't you been living alone
until now?
Now, you have everyone.
My daughter, her father and mother.
We are all there for you.
I will come later. We can
discuss everything then. - Okay.
Your work is not done yet.
Didn't dad find anyone else?
I can't imagine Mr. Pothuwal's
reaction after hearing this news.
How could you even dare to fix
my sister's wedding
without asking my permission?
We, who take care
of everything in all families here
in this region,
cannot tolerate this, Mom!
Don't you want your sister
to get married?
I didn't mean that.
I just don't approve an alliance
with that bloody rascal. That's it!
Mom, our District Joint Secretary,
C. K. Uma Bharathi
had once hinted about his desire
of marrying Lathika.
It seems he has seen her before.
- I see.
So, you want your sister to marry
a jobless and a useless
youngster like you. - Mom!
I can never accept him as my
brother-in-law.
He has a respectable job.
Is that your problem now?
Rubbish!
Forget all that.
Do you know that he
is a shameless fellow?
He is an alcoholic.
And..
He has many bad manners.
How can I tell you, Mom?
Then, tell it to your dad.
- What?
Dad, I just have one thing
to say.
Please don't disgrace me in front
of my fellow party members.
As I have given my word
I will hold this marriage.
- Is it?
Have you already decided?
- Yes.
Let's see.
If INSP is a national party,
this marriage will not happen.
We will not allow it to happen.
Gold prices are increasing
day by day.
How many sovereigns does Lathika
have now?
Actually, we don't have much.
- Really?
Mr. Raghavan would have
already
deposited the money for her
marriage in the bank.
I don't have any deposit
that you are unaware of, Achuthan.
I bought a plot by taking a loan
thinking
of repaying it with my
pension money.
I am left with nothing
after settling that loan.
I thought my children would help
me financially.
But, I was wrong.
One of them is finding ways
to cancel his sister's marriage.
Don't blame them.
You need to blame yourself
for that. Isn't it?
Just stop it now.
I have got some gold.
You don't worry, Mr. Raghavan.
We won't need that.
I am thinking of taking a loan
by keeping the plot as security.
There is no need to give
any prior expectations to anyone.
Udayabhanu seems to be
a gentleman. - That is true.
There comes a lorry.
Have you
already started the wedding
arrangements?
Yes, get down.
Get down.
- Get down, dear. - Come on.
Hey! You stamped on my leg!
Give me the small items.
- Get down slowly.
Look, dad is coming.
- What? Let him. Don't worry.
Father-in-law,
I felt this is more convenient.
After our last meeting
I got seven transfers.
As a result, we got to roam
around and visit places.
I thought of coming here
for a vacation.
Dad, we should look for a school
for the kids here.
Dears, greet your granddad.
Where is mom, Dad?
I will take you to your grandmom.
She is inside, right? - Go.
Oh! - Mom.
- My dears. - Look, your grandmom.
Sister! - Look, here is your aunt.
Now go inside with your aunt.
- Come on. - Go.
I have good news.
I am under suspension now.
He got suspended in Kuttanad.
Since he was blacklisted
by the INSP
he used to have continuous
threats from them.
Amidst all that, the policemen
brought a thief to the station.
An INSP activist who came
to his rescue
was beaten up by Anandan.
That put an end to my travelling
and I got a suspension.
I suggested that we come
here and stay
instead of troubling Anandan's
family.
Anyway, we have no problem here.
I have my loving parents, my dear
siblings and a big house.
Anandan. - Yes?
Even after your suspension,
let us stay here itself. - Okay.
I am tired of packing
and unpacking things.
Otherwise, Dad
you can build me a house
in the new plot
that you bought.
- Hey!
Don't hurry up things.
- I was just reminding him.
Dad, we have to pay the lorry
driver and workers.
Rs. 825, right?
- Rs. 875.
Please pay that, Dad.
By the way, they might ask more.
Don't give it.
What are you doing here? Come
and freshen up! - Yes, coming.
Okay, then. See you tomorrow.
- Okay.
Oh! When did you come, Sister?
I arrived today morning, dear.
I was missing my brothers.
You look so tired.
How are the kids
and Mr. Anandan?
They are extremely well.
Nice!
Oh!
- Hello!
Were you here as well?
- Of course.
Are you done with your party
work for the day, Brother-in-law?
I have mentioned about you
to Mr. Pothuwal.
Yes. I can see the result
of that.
He has sent a telegram
to the home minister.
Right! He told me when I met
him today morning.
Where did you see him?
I met him while he was fishing
in the pond nearby.
Hey! Stop making fun
of my brother. - I am not.
This is my room.
We thought of sleeping here.
- Why?
Didn't you find any other
room here?
Anandan liked this room.
Such a beautiful room.
We are going to stay here
for some time.
You can now leave, Prakashan.
We are feeling sleepy. Go.
Eat something before you
go to bed, okay? Go.
Why did you give them my room?
Nobody gave it to them.
The whole state is in tatters.
Can't I have peace of mind
in my home at least?
Stop grinning and make my bed
in the pantry.
But sister's kids
are sleeping there.
Boban and Kavitha.
Then where the hell will I sleep?
Only the dining table is left now.
Or, you can sleep in the kitchen.
I will give you a slap!
How dare you make fun of me?
I am a popular activist
of the ruling party here.
Don't you know that I have
the influence
to put anyone behind bars
within 24 hours?
Hey, I don't have to live
under the mercy of a policeman.
I don't have to!
Is this house a refugee camp?
You will not understand my value!
Enquire with the people
here. They know me better!
Do you even understand
my importance?
I could not meet you
last night.
You came in very late, didn't you?
I had a study class.
- I see.
So, did you study well?
I am the one who takes the classes.
- Oh!
That's really great!
Shall I tell you a good news?
I got a suspension.
Your sister and kids
are homeless now.
Everyone is here now.
I am expecting a dismissal.
I see. So, INSP is taking
their revenge.
Don't worry, Brother-in-law.
I will highlight this issue
in the next RDP committee meeting.
Please don't go
to those extremes.
No. We cannot tolerate
this about an officer
who helped our party.
If needed,
we will even create a conflict.
Conflicts and clashes are not
something new to us! - Shut up!
Stop your bloody nonsense!
Do you even know the real
meaning of conflict?
Have you ever seen a gun?
Do you even know what a bomb is?
Rubbish!
Hey, politics is not child's play.
Brother-in-law!
- Shut up! Idiot!
If I hear you talking
about politics again
I will beat you black and blue!
Bloody fool!
You..
- Oh!
Rascal!
Dad.
I need to know something.
Who got me married to Anandan?
Anandan came to see me.
You enquired about him and fixed
our marriage.
Isn't it?
Did someone deny this?
No. But the way people
are behaving
seems like I brought him
forcefully here.
You gave me
just 15 sovereigns
of gold for my marriage.
Being from a respectable family
Anandan approved of it.
If I was not good-looking
do you think you could get me
married
with anything less than 50
sovereigns?
You were just lucky to get
this alliance.
Where is the money that you
got on your retirement?
Don't I have any rights
over that money?
When you bought that plot
in mom's name
did you even bother to ask
our opinion?
It was not your money
with which your dad bought
the plot. - Exactly! Wasn't I right
that you don't consider me
to be a part of this family?
We have no such partiality.
Are you here to upset
your father?
Let her tell, Bhanu.
When Anandan was in trouble
did either of your sons ever bother
to help him?
Your husband is to be blamed
for that. - Mom!
I don't want to hear anything
against my husband.
You have no right to say anything.
Anandan's family members care me
so well. - I know that very well.
Is that the reason you abandoned
them and came here?
Really! I didn't come here
expecting your love and care!
We will leave the moment
we get our share of the property.
Hey, Latha.
Don't be so impatient.
We are staying here itself.
They will give our share.
She is very innocent.
She is just short-tempered.
Mother-in-law, do one thing.
Anyway, we are here to stay.
I need to take care of my health.
I need mutton soup for 21 days.
I will need pure ghee.
If you don't have it here,
you can buy it. No problem.
And, I hope you know
that chicken and fish is a must
for my lunch.
After dinner, I will need bananas
and a glass of milk.
You need to wake me up
at 5 a.m. every morning.
I need to resume
my exercise
which I stopped after my
training days.
So, I need to go for a jog.
Don't forget about my soup.
Let us begin this routine
from tomorrow itself. Okay?
You have lots of work to do
in the morning, don't you?
What can be done? One brother
needs to go to the collectorate
and other needs to go
to the estate. Oh!
Ouch! - Brother-in-law.
- Yes? - Will you do me a favour?
Of course!
Since I am jobless, I have lots
of time to do favours.
Tell me, dear.
Will you buy me a tape recorder?
- Just one? - That would do.
Okay. Do you need an Indian
or a foreign one?
The one you can find faster.
Do you need an expensive
or a cheap one?
As you wish. - Then, I will buy
you an expensive one.
I am going to Japan
tomorrow morning.
I can buy it straight
from the Sony showroom.
I will buy you an original one.
What do you say?
How dare you expect me to buy
you one? Rascal!
Get lost!
- Ouch!
Is this Prakashan's shirt?
- Yes.
Don't you think this will suit
me very well?
Brother needs to go out now.
- Is it?
Let him go. No problem.
Just tell him that I took
this shirt.
All his other shirts are dirty.
- So what?
If you try to question me
I will beat you up!
Stop staring at me!
Have you ironed my clothes?
Brother-in-law took your ironed
clothes.
What?
- He took it away.
He threatened me when I stopped him
from doing so.
I see. Has he come here
to cause trouble?
I will.. - Please don't create
issues now. - Let me go!
I can handle him!
I need to go out.
Give me back my clothes.
Doesn't this suit me well? - Stop
kidding and give me my clothes!
I will not give it.
I want to join your party.
Your party is the best.
Anyone would want to join it.
Please help me join your party,
Brother-in-law.
INSP will not stoop that low.
When that time comes,
I will inform you.
I cannot wait until then.
I want to join the party right now.
I want to join today itself.
Do as you wish!
Give me back my clothes! - Take off
your hands. - Remove! - Leave me!
Don't you dare touch me!
- What will you do? - How dare you?
I have been tolerating this
all this while. - Oh, no!
How dare you slap me?
- Oh, no!
What is happening?
- Leave me! - Leave him.
Brother! - There is a limit
for everything. - Leave him.
I will forget that you are my
brother-in-law.
Get out of here! - Brother..
- Leave him! - No!
Don't you dare touch me!
Hey, Prakashan!
You! - Kill me!
You can kill all of us!
Did you come here for this?
I didn't know that these people
were so cruel.
Didn't you get enough
of considering
them as your own?
- Yes, I did.
Dad, we will never forget
this disgrace.
We have law and order here.
Don't underestimate me just
because I am under suspension.
I have the capability to take
care of you all!
Let us not stay here any longer!
Let's leave. Come on.
If we stay here
they might even poison us to death.
Mom, we are leaving empty-handed.
- Come on!
That's enough.
Come on!
You will all pay for this!
- No, Anandan.
Leave me. - Come on..
- Leave me!
Such ungrateful ones!
You will pay for your sins.
- You don't know me well!
God is witnessing all this.
What?
How did you land up here?
Why? I brought him here.
- It's not that.
I can see a transfer.
You are not supposed to be
here at this point in time.
He has to be at the least
300 kilometres far away
from this place.
Politicians have transferred him.
He had to join yesterday.
But he couldn't as he was
not feeling well. - I see.
Can you give us an auspicious time?
'Idavam', 'Midhunam',
'Karkadakam'.
There is an auspicious time
in 'Chingam'.
Oh, no! I can wait only
for a week.
I need an auspicious time
within that.
I am not the one creating
auspicious times.
If you want everything as you wish,
you can marry right now.
Why did you even come here?
- Sir, please.. - Okay.
Well, there is an auspicious time
next Wednesday. - Okay.
Between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m.
- That would do.
Bhanu. - Yes.
Did you meet him?
Yes, I met him.
There is a reason behind
Prakashan's anger. - What is that?
It seems Udayabhanu had made
fun of him
when Prakashan had approached
him for contributions.
Prakashan did not remain idle.
He got Udayabhanu transferred.
Genuinely speaking, Bhanu
I am getting scared.
I have started feeling
that our own children
are a danger to us.
We need to get Lathika married
as soon as possible.
If this is the condition
when we are alive
just think about the situation
after we die.
Mr. Raghavan.
I need to speak to you.
- What is it?
I need to speak to you.
What is it, Achuthan?
- Nothing..
Tell me what the matter is.
You told me that you'd be
pawning your land, right? - Yes.
Have you sold it?
- Sell?
Will I ever do such a thing
without your knowledge? - Right.
That was what I was thinking, too.
What is the problem now?
Don't worry, Raghavan.
I saw some people measuring
the plot. - What?
Yes. I didn't have
the faintest idea.
I saw the surveyor and people
gathered there.
What are you saying?
Hello!
The owner of the plot is here.
What is going on here?
Sir! This is Raghavan Nair,
retired station master.
This plot belongs to his wife.
Didn't you get our notice?
- No.
We are confiscating this plot.
Your elder son..
What's his name?
Prabhakaran.
He had pawned this plot
in their bank
for the construction work
of his party office.
Bhanumathi is your wife, right?
- Yes.
She had signed the consent.
Sir, he bought this land with his
whole life's earnings.
We are helpless.
This is a court order.
Where were you?
What did Achuthan say?
So, you were cheating me, too.
I had bought that plot with my
hard-earned money.
I bought it in your name
as I thought we were one.
How could you do such a thing
without even asking me?
What happened?
Go and see. The bank officials
are confiscating our plot.
Oh, my God!
What will I do for Lathika's
marriage?
Actually, Prabhakaran forced me
saying that it was just a matter
of a few days. - Where is your
son? He was nowhere to be seen!
I did this to help our son.
When he promised to get it back
before you got to know.. - No!
You need not say anything.
My children did not understand me.
They didn't love me.
Neither did you!
You will not see me alive
for long.
It is already late.
You need to go home, Mr. Raghavan.
Or eat something from here.
- No.
Get me my torch.
I will drop you home.
Am I causing you trouble?
Why are you saying so,
Mr. Raghavan?
If you keep thinking
about the same thing
it will just make you more upset.
That's it.
I have got several things
to think about now.
Do you know, Achuthan?
Because I got regular transfers
I made my kids stay at home
thinking about their education.
I spent my good years
eating the bland food
on railway platforms.
I was scared to even drink tea.
I thought I could save that money
to send home.
I wished a bright future
for my children.
I used to feel restless at the time
of their school reopenings.
I had to buy them books
and new clothes.
I stayed away from Bhanu
for the sake of my children.
Don't think about all that.
Actually, both of you are really
blessed.
You have prayed
and made offerings to have a child.
You are just upset that you have
no child.
Just think about your own
children becoming a curse for you.
I shall leave.
Haven't you slept yet?
During all these years, I've never
done anything that would hurt you.
You never gave me a chance
to do that.
Whatever I said was out of anguish.
Let it go.
Come. It's really late.
It's high time
that we do something!
I guess it's already late now.
When we call for a protest
out of the blue
the public..
- Forget the public!
How can we call for a protest
just in our village? - Why not?
RDP has to make
its presence felt now. - Yes.
So, we'll protest on the
3rd of next month. - Yes.
Wait..
What day is it?
It's a Friday.
- You are sure, right?
Then, let's
not protest on the 3rd.
I have a family function that day.
How about the 4th then?
- Okay. - Yes.
So, we'll take the village by
storm on the 4th!
Let's hoist flags and hang posters
everywhere in the village!
Our protest should raise
question marks over inflation.
Normal life should
be hit by the protest.
We should shock the police and put
pressure on the government!
Wish you all the best.
- Thank you.
This isn't how I had
her wedding in mind.
Do you have to explain to me?
I had a lot of dreams
when I came here after retirement.
Your marriage
was the biggest of them.
A large canopy on our courtyard..
Your brothers running errands
and organising everything..
And so on.
I used to tell my friends back then
that I'd invite
them for your wedding
and they should attend.
I couldn't do any of it.
I guess this is what
fate had in store for you. - Dad!
Please don't curse me.
Please don't think
that I'm getting
rid of you through this
unceremonious wedding.
Please don't say that, Dad.
I'm not sad at all.
It's time for them to leave,
isn't it, Mr. Raghavan?
We can't bear you coming home
and bidding farewell.
You may leave.
Mom!
We shall visit you after
you've joined your new office.
Come prepared
to stay with us for a few days.
Okay.
Bye.
Lathika is really fortunate.
But still, she was
married off like some orphan girl..
Bhanu.
Achu.
- Yes.
Hire a taxi.
- Okay.
Bhanu.
Mr. Raghavan.
We should
be bold at times like this.
God won't abandon us.
- God
has abandoned me, Achu.
Please don't say that.
We are all here for you.
Please don't worry.
What should be our stance regarding
hospitals and medical shops?
We should shut them down
for the protest to be complete.
What about electricity
and distribution of milk?
Why doubt it?
We should
shut down all the institutions
that the public depends on.
That's exactly
what we should do!
Isn't it obvious?
Prabhakaran..
- What? - Wait.
Bhanu is hospitalised.
- What happened?
She had chest pain
and lost consciousness. - I see.
Didn't you inform dad?
- He is at the hospital.
It's fine, then.
Just tell him that you met me.
We're calling
for a protest on the 4th.
I shall visit her when I get time.
Let's go. - Okay.
Hurry up, Prakashan.
We have to print 2,000 copies
before 4 a.m.
Damn! Don't criticise me
if the content isn't good.
No! The content should be good.
Each word should be thunderous!
RDP activists should be humiliated.
- It'll take time, then.
Prakashan..
What do you want? You can't
talk to Prakashan now.
I want to tell him something.
- No way. Just leave, mister.
It's something important.
We're in the middle
of something even more important!
He is drafting a notice to make the
public rally against RDP's protest.
Do you get me?
- What do you want, Mr. Achu?
I don't need anything.
Your mother is hospitalised.
What? - It's okay. Right now,
Prakashan is doing something
to safeguard our motherland,
Mother India!
Which hospital? - She.. - We're
losing time. Draft the notice.
Get lost, mister!
Didn't you hear me?
Mom.. - Continue.
How much have you written?
'For the government..'
'To come up with innovative ways..'
- Use phrases like that!
Please don't
engage her in conversation.
I've brought some porridge.
I was told that
she is feeling better now.
The doctor said not to give her any
food. - You may have it then.
How are
you feeling now, ma'am?
Why aren't Prabhakaran
and Prakashan here, Achu?
T-They haven't found out
about this.
I met Prashanthan
at the junction.
I didn't tell him anything
as he would get upset.
They might get to know of it
and come here now.
Come with me, Achu.
What is it?
Didn't you meet Prabhakaran
and Prakashan? - No.
I know you too well, Achu.
The look on your face says
that you met them.
What are you saying, Mr. Raghavan?
Tell me the truth.
Didn't you see them?
That isn't what we should
be concerned about now.
I'm just curious to know.
- Just leave it.
Just tell me what you want.
Teacher and I
are here for you.
Just tell me
if you want more people!
My children are busy, aren't they?
All these are life lessons, Achu.
People talk about
children and blood relations.
Those relationships are worthless.
We live for our children
hoping that they'd be there for us
when we reach old age.
But, I've realised that
we are on our own.
You may leave, Achu.
Why should you be here when
my children haven't bothered to?
I..
- Just leave.
I don't want anyone to come here.
Just leave me alone.
If the Almighty is merciful to us
He will call us soon.
They are the ruling
party and they control the cops.
I heard that cops would be posted
everywhere in the town.
In that case,
all the shops will be open.
We will attack the cops, then!
Are we going to attack
them with oil cakes?
Oilcakes?
Mr. Prabhakaran! Don't use
unparliamentary words!
T-The word 'Oil cake' is
parliamentary. It's fodder.
But the situation is
unparliamentary. Don't repeat it!
Tell us how we'd
attack them, Mr. Pillai.
We shall adopt the tactic used by
Chhatrapati Sivaji, the Red Army
and Fidel Castro.
Let's emulate history.
Guerrilla warfare!
We don't have weapons.
A wise man will make tools of what
comes to hand. - Be practical!
Let's use stones as our weapons!
We'll stone the cops!
Where will we hide in the town?
Drainages and the banyan tree.
Our men should hide at those
places by midnight.
We'll ambush them!
Once the situation becomes chaotic
not even a single shop
would be open.
What if the cops arrest us?
- Let them.
It's impossible for a revolution
to succeed unless we take risks!
Come. Let's find hideouts!
I don't think this is going to
work out.. - Mr. Prabhakaran
first obey, then question!
Come on.
Oh, my God!
What is it?
Gosh!
Would they have heard us?
Would they have?
There is no point
in standing here.
Let's stick to the plan.
Come on.
Why are these morons here?
When did they come here?
You could have searched the house.
How am I supposed to know?
They wouldn't have heard us as
we spoke in low tones. - I see.
Mr. Prabhakaran.
Where is your father?
Your brother said
that he doesn't know.
I've something
important to speak with him.
I don't have him
hidden in my pocket!
Why are all of you here?
Is there a meeting here?
How is mom feeling now, Dad?
- She is all right.
I see. - I'll be right back.
Please wait here. - Okay.
Let's go, then.
- I want you to wait as well.
I've something to tell you
regarding your mother's illness.
Let's wait for a while.
- Okay.
Mr. Raghavan Nair.
We have something to tell you.
Our lawyer will speak with you.
She is ill. Let me first
take her to our room.
Lie down.
I'm not feeling tired.
It's better
that you take some rest.
I want everyone except my children
and relatives to leave.
We have some
family matters to discuss.
KRP, we have a lot to do.
KRP and CRP belong outside!
Get the hell out of here!
You want to talk about her share
of the property, right?
Yes. As per the amendment
passed in 1966..
So you don't know, do you?
The bank confiscated the land
that was in Bhanumathi's name.
What?
Ask your share
of the property from the bank.
They might give it to you.
What remains is this property.
It's in my name.
I've no plans to partition it now.
- What do you mean?
Anandan.
Your lawyer, or anyone else
for that matter
can force me to partition it.
Gosh!
Did I beg you to marry my daughter?
Becoming
a family man was your desire.
You'd have married another
woman, if not her, right?
You were a stranger to me
and I spent a lot of my hard-earned
money for the sake
of you having a family.
Are you trying to take advantage
of me again?
How dare you come here
with your lawyer?
I don't owe you any money, do I?
It's a husband's
responsibility to support his wife.
He should never depend
on his in-laws for that.
You have two children, dear.
Think of how you'd feel if they
do this to you in the future.
That's your mother inside.
The one who gave
birth to you and raised you.
You didn't bother to visit her
when she was hospitalised.
You won't realise how much
parents love their children.
You'd only realise it
when you have children.
She gave you the title deed
without hesitation because she
loves you more
than she loves me.
Have you loved her even a bit?
Politics and
social work are honourable
when good men are involved in it.
How on earth are you going to
serve the nation when you can't
even support your parents?
Politics isn't something that
men who are good for nothing
should consider
as their last resort.
Useless men like you have
blemished the dignity of politics!
Do you get me?
You tried to ruin you
sister's marriage proposal.
You managed
to get him transferred.
I have wanted to give you
a gift for that.
In every business
the investor
should achieve a profit
or else, the business
would collapse.
My business has collapsed.
My investment
was the hard work I put in
over all these years
since you were born.
It's gone now.
So, let's end it right here
right now. Get out!
I'm cutting all ties with my
children and their spouses.
Get out of here right now!
One should
first correct himself.
Then, his family.
Only after that should he try
to correct society.
Bhanu
sweep the entire house
and cleanse it.
Light a lamp as well.
Let's have some grace here.
I have served supper.
It looks like I came
at the perfect time.
Why are you silent?
I'll tell you something.
Don't feel annoyed, Mr. Raghavan.
I liked what you did
but when I
thought about it later, I realised
that I couldn't concur with it.
I'm saying this to you as I feel
I have the freedom to.
You banged some sense into them
and I appreciate you for it.
Do you know what's wrong
with abandoning them?
People would say that you're unable
to change them for the better.
What if I consider
that they aren't my children?
That's where the problem lies.
Is the relationship
between a father and his children
something that can
just be broken like that?
Can Bhanu bear that?
Would you be
able to live with that?
It's easy to abandon them
but you need
to be intelligent to change
them for the better.
I'm not intelligent.
You have to be.
They have understood you now.
Just advise them and they will
mend their ways.
No, Achu.
- I assure you they will.
They should first decide
to change for the better.
What if they have
already decided to?
Both of them
are waiting at the gate.
They're not coming here
as they are scared to.
Would any politician
respect them when
they've been kicked out
of their own house!
I've told them everything.
Go inside. Pray to God
to help you mend your ways.
Come on.
Just go.
Wake up.
Wake up!
Prakashan will miss the bus.
He is waiting for you
to bless him before he leaves.
Is he attending
an interview today as well?
Yes. He says that he
will get the job for sure.
Also, the job would offer
him a good salary. - I see.
It's not necessary
that I bless you every day.
It's always in my mind.
Did Prabhakaran leave?
I'm leaving, Dad.
Mr. Menon might ask me
to appear in court today.
He says that he'd let me plead
the case if I analyse it well.
I've analysed it to the core.
Are you heading to the town?
- Yes.
Let's hire an auto rickshaw then.
Dad
I'll reclaim our property
within a month.
The property doesn't matter.
All I want to see
are you leading successful lives.
What is this?
I was thrown out
of class without any reason.
We've formed a student's union.
We need a flag.
We'll be on strike form today.
You'd not have been thrown out
without some solid reason.
Yes. You aren't supposed
to protest against it.
Give it. - Why?
- Give it, I say!
Give it to him. - Hey!
- Give it! - Stop!
No. - To hell with
his flag and strike! - You!
Move.
'SANDESHAM'
