Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey
Hello my ragtime man
Send me your kiss by wire
Baby, my heart's on fire
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Oh, baby, telephone
And tell me I was your own
Hello, hello, hello there
Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey
If you find anything in there, brother,
I'll share it with you.
Send me your kiss by wire
Baby, my heart's on fire
If you refuse me
Honey, you'll lose me
Then you'll be left alone
Oh, baby
What kind of a vessel is it?
A schooner bound for the Japanese coast.
What's its cargo?
- I'm only asking you to sail on it, not to buy it.
- I've been tricked before. What's its cargo?
It's a seal hunter. Now, if the catch is good,
there'll probably be a bonus in it for you.
What's the name of the vessel?
The Ghost.
Wait a minute. It isn't easy for a sailing man
to get a berth these days.
- With steam cutting down on the size--
- Get out of my way.
- Sixty a month, sailor. That's good pay.
- Yeah, if you live to collect it.
You're not afraid of hard work, are you?
Hard work?
No work is hard as long as you can remain
a human being while doing it.
I wouldn't sail on a ship like the Ghost...
...if she were the only sailing vessel left
on the Pacific Ocean.
Rosie, you are my posie
You are my heart's bouquet
Come out here in the moonlight
There's some sweet fine love
I want to say
Your honey boy, I'm waiting
Those ruby lips to greet
Don't be so aggravating
My blushing Rosie
My Posie sweet
It's all right, brother. They've gone.
- Who?
- The coppers.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- All right. Forget I said it. I'll buy you a drink.
Two.
- Why?
- Oh, I just don't like to drink alone.
Sailor?
I've been on a ship.
Well, here's how.
Hey.
You don't have to slip me a mickey
to get me on your boat.
I'll ship on the first and quickest one
out of here.
Hey you. You're the fellow
who signed on for the Ghost?
- Yeah.
- Come on down.
- Drunk?
- Yeah.
Now, I wonder how that happened.
Don't pay him no mind. He's drunk.
How else do you think we got men
to sail aboard a hell ship like the Ghost?
Do you think they're all fools like you are?
- Shut up, Cooky.
- I'll not shut up.
Let the chills fear run up his spine,
like they did mine...
...when I made my first voyage
aboard the foulest ship in creation.
Oh, you'll have a lovely time
aboard the Ghost.
I won't tell you again, Cooky.
At night, you'll go to sleep
praying for the morning...
...and during the day,
you'll pray for the night.
But there's one thing you'll pray for
most of all...
...to tear out with your own fingers the cold,
merciless heart of Wolf Larsen.
I said, shut up.
Well?
I beg your pardon.
Listen, two men, they're coming out here.
They'll ask questions.
You'll say you know me.
I'm a friend of yours.
My name's Maud. Maud Webster.
We're going to San Francisco
to visit some friends.
Now, can you remember that?
Maud. Maud Webster.
- But--
- Oh, please.
What's your name?
Van Weyden, Humphrey Van Weyden.
Humphrey Van Weyden.
I'll remember that.
Talk to me. Say anything, please.
- Yes?
- This woman is--
- What about her?
- She's with you?
I fail to see why I have to answer
any of your questions.
Before you say anything,
I'd like to remind you...
...that it's a criminal offense
to aid an escaped convict.
That's funny.
The woman looks just like me.
Doesn't she, Humphrey?
It's lucky I'm with you.
Otherwise, these gentlemen would arrest me,
and you'd have to come to the police station...
...and go through all sorts of trouble
trying to explain to them....
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.
It's the law.
That's right, the law.
- I wanna remind you that it's a criminal offense.
- That'll be enough.
You'll wait in his cabin
until we reach San Francisco.
- Hard to port.
- Hard to port.
Don't!
Help.
Ahoy!
Ahoy!
Is anybody here?
Is anybody here?
This man lying here?
That's the first mate. I think he's dying.
- Dying?
- Yeah. He always had a weak heart.
I guess all the rum he lapped up in Frisco
did him in this time.
The old man will be awful mad if he croaks.
Good first mates are hard to find.
Nobody even seems to care.
They act as though his death
were a matter of course.
Well, mister, onboard this ship,
you might say it is.
I'm the man who was picked up
out of the bay. I'm deeply grateful.
He's dead, sir.
"He's dead, sir"?
My mate's dead.
You dirty, drunken sot, you die too easy.
The rum should've first withered your limbs,
rotted away your flesh, eaten out your eyes.
The man is dead, sir.
Man? Heh.
That's not a man any longer.
That's just a lump of rum-soaked flesh.
- Svenson?
- Aye, sir?
Get your palm a needle and sew the beggar up.
You'll find some old canvas in the sail-locker.
- What'll I tie his feets in?
- We'll see to that.
- Aye, sir.
- Cooky.
Yes, sir. Sir.
- Go below and fill a sack with coal.
- Yes.
Any of you fellas got a Bible
or a prayer book?
You look like you might know
a prayer or two by heart.
You've got a preacher's look about you.
What's your name?
Van Weyden. Humphrey Van Weyden.
Even sounds like a preacher's name.
I'm a writer.
What do you write about?
Whatever I see.
This the first time you ever saw a man die?
It's the first time I've ever seen
such indifference to death.
Well, you haven't seen enough
to be a good writer.
- This voyage ought to do you a lot of good.
- Voyage?
What do you mean?
That's the pilot boat, isn't it?
That's right.
Doesn't seem to be very far away.
It shouldn't take long to put back.
I'd pay you whatever you think
your delay is worth to you.
Don't you intend putting me ashore?
No, Mr. Van Weyden, I don't.
You can't be serious about this.
Very serious.
My mate's dead. That leaves me one man short.
You're that man.
There's nothing I can do aboard a ship.
No, nothing much.
You're soft like a woman.
Woman. I'd almost forgotten.
What about her?
- Cooky?
- At your service. Coal will be up in a minute.
What about that woman we fished up?
Oh, she's in a bad way, sir.
Louie says he hardly expects her
to live through the night.
It would be a shame for her to die.
She's so young and so beautiful.
A wench like that might very well liven up
the tedious days of a long voyage.
You'll put me off at the first port of call.
I touch no ports, Mr. Van Weyden.
- We'll meet other ships sailing back.
- I hardly think so, Mr. Van Weyden.
The Ghost don't sail
the regular ships' lanes.
You're stuck until we touch the port
of Frisco again.
There's such a thing as the law.
I'm obeying the law, Mr. Van Weyden.
The law of the sea, which says
anything you find in it is yours to keep.
I guess you can wash dishes
and do scullion work.
That will release an able-bodied man
for able-bodied work.
You're signed up as cabin boy, $20 a month.
What if I refuse?
Hey, cabin boy. Come here.
What's your name?
- George Leach.
- Sir.
Sir.
- Ever ship on a schooner before?
- No, sir.
Who signed you?
I wasn't interested in the man's name, sir.
- Did you get any advance money?
- I didn't have time to wait for it, sir.
You must have been in a hurry to get onboard.
What do the police have on you in Frisco?
That's a lie. Nobody's got nothing on me.
I can prove it.
Ha, ha. You ought to learn to control
that temper of yours, Leach.
You give yourself away too easy.
You're not cabin boy anymore.
Our literary friend here
is taking your job away.
You're promoted.
You're now boat-puller.
- Svenson.
- Aye, sir.
What do you know about navigation?
- Nothing, sir.
- Just as well.
You're first mate just the same. When you're
through with that, get your stuff and go aft.
- Aye, sir.
- What are you standing around for?
I didn't sign up for boat-puller.
I signed for cabin boy.
I don't want no part of boat pulling.
It's a dirty, heartbreaking job.
You said you never sailed
on a schooner before.
I once read about it in a book.
Pack up and go forward, you filthy scum.
Better do as he says, boy.
He isn't talking to a dog.
He's talking to a man.
So you're a man, huh?
I've spit in the eye of better men than you
for saying less.
- You're disobeying orders, Leach.
- I don't like the way you give them.
You still feel like refusing, Mr. Van Weyden?
Get him to the galley.
Cooky will show what there is to do.
Cooky.
Ahoy! Pilot boat!
Ahoy!
- Svenson.
- Aye, sir.
- Through with that job?
- Aye, sir.
Call all hands aft.
We might as well have the funeral.
Aye, sir.
I only remember the last part of the service.
And, uh....
And the body shall be cast into the sea.
What are you standing around for?
Cast it in.
Heave.
"From 5 in the morning till 10 at night...
...I am forced to listen to his oily,
insinuating tones.
To watch his greasy smile
and to enjoy his monstrous self-conceit."
Is that me you're writing about?
If the descriptions fit you.
Keep a civil tongue.
You hadn't finish cleaning up that slop.
Well, strike me pink
if this ain't gratitude for you.
Here you come, a poor,
miserable specimen of human scum.
I take you into my galley,
I treat you handsome...
...and you write lies about me.
I have a good mind to bash your head in
with a frying pan.
- You've got no right to read those things.
- Get out.
"But he is but one portrait
in a gallery of rogues."
A well-turned phrase, I must say.
"The men onboard this ship,
with the exception of a few...
...are all cast in the same mold
as the master, Wolf Larsen...
...a brutal, callous and inhuman lot."
Oh, I'd hate to be in your shoes
when Larsen reads this.
- You're not gonna show those to him.
- It's my duty as a loyal member of the crew.
"I keep thinking about the woman
lying ill below deck."
You and me both, matey.
"And the tragic fate
that seems to hang over her...
...that sends her from one evil to another."
Oh, so you've met her before, have you?
Whether I've met her is none of your concern.
Give me those.
It's my duty to turn them over
to the proper authorities.
- Give me them.
- No.
You're not only a thief,
you're an informer as well.
Informer and thief, is it?
There was a purse in those clothes
you so graciously changed for me.
That purse is now empty.
- No one else but you could--
- You keep your mouth shut, you hear?
If you give me those notes.
The only thing you'll get from me
is the back of my hand.
Once in Liverpool, the judge gave me
two years for knifing a man.
Onboard this ship,
it's not a criminal offense.
Six bells. The men will be eating soon.
Now, get back to your work.
You like being mate, don't you? Gives you
a good feeling to be able to kick a man.
- Couple of hours ago, I beat Johnson up.
- I need my crew to work this ship...
...not to have them battered up below decks.
You told me to keep discipline.
I was afraid of trouble when we signed him on.
He was inciting a mutiny.
- What did he say?
- Oh, he asked too many questions.
- Does he know about my brother's ship?
- I don't think so.
None of you have been talking, have you?
And none of you better. So far as the crew
is concerned, we're hunting seals.
- The longer they think so, the better for all us.
- I'm not sure of that.
We'll need them to fight for us
if your brother's ship catches up to us.
Well, they'll fight or drown.
None of you bet--
Hey, Louie, do something.
- Captain's got another one of his headaches.
- No, it's all right.
It's going away.
You don't have to do anything. It's all right.
What questions did he ask?
Why we keep changing our course
so many times...
...why we have a cannon aboard
a sealing schooner.
Did you answer him?
Yeah, with a marlinespike on the side
of his head, but not too hard.
Excuse me. Did you say you hit somebody
with a marlinespike?
- Yeah.
- I'll go and put some stitches in his head.
Uh, sit down, Louie,
and finish drinking your supper.
In the condition you're in now, you're liable
to put your stitches in the wrong places.
- Oh, uh, how about your patient, Louie?
- Huh?
- Oh, my patient. She's improving.
- Mm.
Her condition was rather--
You take good care of her.
She's a friend of our literary cabin boy.
- A heavy fate hangs over her.
- It's possible. I was just--
And with you taking care of her,
it's more than possible.
Louie has a perfect record onboard this ship.
He's never cured a patient yet.
- It's not my-- It's not my fault.
- Ha, ha.
The men, by the time they get to me,
they're half-dead.
I'm a good doctor.
Hey, doctor. You're a faker. Ha, ha.
That's a lie. It's a dirty lie.
I was graduated from three universities.
From-- I was head of a clinic.
I've performed great operations.
I could perform them again
if I had the instruments...
...if my hands didn't shake so much.
It's funny. I can't control
my hands anymore.
You. You're a stranger.
You're an intelligent man.
You believe me, don't you?
- Sure. I believe you.
- Ah. See?
See? He believes me.
Somebody believes me.
Excuse me.
I will attend to my patient.
Cooky told me to clean up in here.
I thought I'd get through
before the men finished eating.
I happened to find this lying open, and....
- Yeah, it's a great poem, isn't it?
- Yes, it's a great poem.
Read me some of it.
Here at least we shall be free
Here we may reign secure, and in my choice,
To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell.
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
That's a great line.
Milton really understood the devil.
Sit down.
This is the first time you've ever been
in my cabin, isn't it?
Didn't expect to find anything like this,
did you?
I really read them too.
Maybe it would have been better
if I had never opened a book.
Cooky gave me your notes. I read them.
You don't have to be afraid.
I enjoyed them. You write very well.
Thank you.
"A brutal, callous and inhuman lot...
...cast in the same mold as their master,
Wolf Larsen."
And I wonder what you'll be like
when this voyage is over.
- Do you think I'll change?
- Oh, yes, very much.
I don't think so, Larsen.
That's part of your education.
You must say "Captain Larsen" or "sir."
Remember, there's a difference
in our social standing onboard this vessel.
What class of society
do you belong to on land?
You don't have to answer.
It's written all over you.
Good education, breeding,
refinement, sensitivity.
You got all the things that money can buy,
including money.
Whatever money I have
is earned from my books.
What?
You mean, you actually earn money?
How much?
- About 10,000 a year.
- Okay.
Well, you must be pretty good.
What kind of books do you write?
All sorts of fiction.
Oh, fiction. Nothing important.
No. Nothing very important.
Yes, but you wouldn't have to earn
all that money.
If something would happen to you, like losing
your arms or legs, or going blind...
...someone would take care of you,
your friends, family.
They wouldn't be a brutal
and inhuman lot, would they?
You wouldn't have to struggle for a living.
You wouldn't have to live in a world...
...where your hand was turned against
every man's and every man's against yours...
...even your own brother's.
You seem to find it necessary
to justify yourself, don't you, Captain Larsen?
My strength justifies me,
Mr. Van Weyden.
The fact that I can kill you or let you live
as I choose.
The fact that I control the destinies
of all onboard.
The fact that it's my will
and my will alone that rules here.
That's justification enough.
- Where are you going?
- Cooky's expecting me in the galley.
Well, don't go. Let him wait.
It's a long time since I've talked like this
with anyone.
Sit down.
What do you intend doing
with these notes of yours?
Perhaps someday, I might write a book
about my voyage on the Ghost.
You'll write about me, too,
in this book of yours, won't you?
You'll be the leading character.
That's a good idea, a book about me.
I'll help you with it.
We'll spend lots of time together.
I'll tell you stories about my early life,
stories that'll make them understand....
What difference does it make to me
whether anybody understands or not?
Oh, yes.
I could tell you many things.
Of the bleak coast town where I was born,
of my mother and father, peasants of the sea...
...who sold their sons upon the waves,
got nothing in return but misery.
Five brothers I had.
Four of them are dead, drowned like rats
in the fo'c'sles of rotten, leaking ships.
Oh, no. That's not for me.
I'll choose my death like I've chosen my life.
Cabin boy at 12, ship's boy at 14,
ordinary seaman at 16...
...owner and master of my own vessel at 21.
All by myself, I did it.
I learned everything by myself: navigation,
mathematics, science, literature.
All of this.
All of this I want written down,
do you hear me? All of this.
- The first mate wants to see you below, sir.
- What's wrong?
The woman. I think she's dying.
What are you bothering me for?
Let Louie take care of it. He's the doctor.
Louie's in no condition to take care
of anything, sir. He's too drunk.
Cooky.
I was trying to see if there was any life left
in her, sir. I was holding her pulse, sir.
- What are you doing in here?
- The mate told me to stay with her.
That's the truth, sir. You can ask him, sir.
She's awful pretty.
- It's a shame she has to die.
- Shut up.
Did you try to wake him up?
Not much use. When Louie has a snootful
like that, he's out for the whole day.
Leach, see if you can bring
that drunken swine to.
She's breathing rather hard, sir.
- As though she were choking.
- Open a porthole, Cooky.
- We're in heavy sea, sir. We'll be drenched.
- Open it up.
- Well?
- I can't do anything with him, sir.
Every time I get him awake,
he keeps dropping off again.
- Wake up, you drunken--
- He's awake, sir.
Make sure that he stays awake.
I got some hot coffee on the stove.
- I will get it.
- No. You stay here. I'll need you.
Leach, go to the galley
and bring up that pot of coffee.
Be quick about it.
Two men, they're coming in here.
They'll ask questions.
You say you know me.
Yes. I'll say it.
I won't let them take me back.
I won't let them take me back.
You don't know what it's like
being in prison.
I'd rather die.
- I'd rather die.
- Well, strike me pink. A convict.
A blooming, sniveling,
snarling, no-good convict.
She's not a lady. She's one of us.
Have I said something that strikes you
funny, sir? I'm glad, sir. I'm awfully glad.
Ah, you don't appreciate the humor of this,
Van Weyden.
Here this boat is loaded to the gallows
with as varied an assortment of derelicts...
...and outcasts as ever sailed
before the same mast...
...and what do we fish up out of the sea?
As Cooky puts it, another one of us.
Oh, I had a dream, a horrible dream.
Somebody kept on hitting me.
I begged them to stop,
but they just kept on hit....
It was no dream.
What else could I do
but sit here and get drunk?
I can't save her.
She's as good as gone.
- Listen to me.
- Let him have his drink.
- He's no good for anything else.
- We can't just let her die.
- There must be some last chance.
- Sure, sure.
- I could perform a blood transfusion.
- Well?
Onboard this boat,
with the instruments that I've got...
...it's like asking me to perform a miracle.
All right, then. Perform one.
No. No, I can't.
My-- My hands are-- I need--
What he needs he'll never find again.
He's lost his nerve. Am I right, Louie?
Louie, listen to me.
You asked me before if I believed in you.
I said I did.
No. It might happen again.
If it did, I couldn't stand it. I'd kill myself.
This way, her life is not in my hands.
It's in the hands of fate.
I haven't anything to do with it.
You can't just perform a blood transfusion.
You've got to make sure
that the blood itself is alike.
What?
Well, don't let that stop you, Louie.
- Leach.
- Yes, sir?
You'll give your blood for this woman,
won't you?
- Certainly, sir.
- There you are.
Go ahead, Louie. You're lucky.
I'll guarantee you their blood is the same.
I get the point.
Don't you get it, Louie?
They both got the same blood.
He's a convict, she's a convict.
Get it? Jailbird's blood.
That's what the captain means.
Well, go on, Louie. Let's see you do it.
You even got yourself an assistant.
Cooky's done the first part of the job for you.
Medicine chest.
Better get that blood quickly
before it cools off.
You don't have to worry, captain.
This kind of blood never cools off.
- Bringing about!
- Bringing about!
Let go of the jib sheet.
- Resting?
- I don't feel well, sir.
Well, maybe this will make you feel better.
Leave him be. Get to work.
- The kid's really sick, sir.
- Go forward.
Go below, I'll do his work for him.
I said he was to go forward.
What difference does it make?
As long as the work is done.
Leach, ever since
you come onboard this ship...
...I've had to beat you at least once a day.
Don't you ever get tired of it?
Maybe sometime,
you won't have to beat just him alone.
Look at this.
Stop laughing at me.
Stop laughing.
Haven't you seen a man dressed up before?
Careful of the step, my dear.
Your arm, my dear.
Captain Larsen, Miss Webster, my patient.
I'm glad to see
that you're up and about, ma'am.
Thank you for everything.
I must have caused you a great deal
of inconvenience.
Oh, no. On the contrary, I did nothing more
than my Christian duty.
- I'd like to thank the sailor who gave his blood.
- Uh, yes. Yes. Uh-- Young man.
- The name is Leach.
- Excuse me. My memory.
Here he is.
I'm very grateful, young man.
When I reach shore, I shall see
that you're well-rewarded.
Say thank you to the lady.
Thank you, lady.
Sorry that I couldn't turn back,
put you ashore when you were picked up.
But you were so sick,
it would be dangerous to move you.
That was my diagnosis.
Oh, I beg your pardon, doctor.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
The, uh, people you left behind.
- People?
- Mm-hm.
- What people?
- Oh, I mean your family.
They've probably given you up
for dead by now.
I can imagine how happy they'll be to see
you again when you get back to Frisco.
- Frisco?
- Mm-hm.
You're going back
without touching any other port?
Oh, yes. This is a sealing schooner.
We make our catch and go home.
Oh.
- Anything wrong, Miss Webster?
- Nothing.
I just feel a little dizzy.
I guess I'm not as strong as I thought I was.
You've been out too long.
You shouldn't be out more
than five minutes at a time. I'll take you back.
- Excuse me.
- Certainly.
Oh, Miss Webster, uh, your accommodations,
are they satisfactory?
Yes. Thank you.
Quite.
- Cooky.
- Aye, sir?
I want you to do all you can
to make Miss Webster feel at home.
Put some bars on her window.
So you couldn't keep
your mouth shut, could you?
Maybe that will make you answer me.
You spoke about your past
while you were unconscious.
- You were overheard.
- I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
You deliberately told them.
I swear, it's the truth.
All right.
I lied to you.
I put on an act.
Now, you had your laugh. You will
give me a break, won't you, skipper?
What do you want me to do?
There must be boats
passing on the way to China.
- You could put me aboard one of them.
- Lady, all this voyage...
- ...I've been trying to stay clear of boats.
- Or an island.
You could put me ashore on an island. I read
someplace where the Pacific's full of them.
You know, someplace where boats pull in.
I can make my way from there.
Louie, take her below.
- You'd better come.
- No. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Listen.
You all look like pretty decent fellas.
Like you've been in spots like this before.
Give me a break, will you?
Will you?
You won't be sorry.
I promise you, you won't.
You're not on the Barbary Coast now.
You're onboard my vessel.
You behave yourself, or you'll spend
the rest of the voyage locked below.
I didn't mean it that way. Honest, I didn't.
Don't hold it against me, please. Please.
Oh, give me a break, will you? Will you?
- Don't beg him, you hear me?
- Beg?
I'll crawl on my knees
over every inch of this deck.
I'd do anything,
anything not to have to go back.
- Do you know what it's like being in jail?
- Yeah, I know.
It ain't enough you knock her down.
You gotta kick her too.
Come on. I'll take you back to your cabin.
Oh, leave me alone, will you?
Leave me alone.
Look out!
Leach, according to the laws of the sea,
I could hang you for this.
But I won't.
You're gonna save me that trouble.
Before this voyage is over,
you'll hang yourself.
Take him below.
You should have let me die.
He should have let me die.
Get back to work.
Van Weyden.
Come into my cabin.
I suppose I ought to thank you
for saving my life.
It was instinctive.
You sound like you're sorry.
You don't have to work in the galley.
- There's a bunk in the officers' quarters.
- I prefer to stay with the men.
Well, suit yourself.
Only, I don't think they'll have you after today.
You see, their instincts are a little different
than yours.
They wanted Leach to hit me on the head
with that spike.
You're in a bad way, sort of in the middle.
But I suppose you're used to that.
Your sort usually is.
At least there's nothing on my conscience.
Ha, ha. You don't think
there's anything on mine, do you?
Well, if that woman kills herself....
Kill herself?
Why should she kill herself?
There's a price
that no one wants to pay for living.
How would you know?
You're an onlooker of life.
She talks about going to another country
to start a new life.
But she knows well enough that that new life
isn't gonna be different than the old.
She'll be on the streets of Shanghai
like she was in Frisco.
And people will degrade her,
but she won't kill herself, no.
She'll go on living until she decays.
Captain Larsen, a few weeks ago, you were
interested in this book I intended writing.
You were very concerned
with how I portrayed you to the world.
- Would you like to hear my description of you?
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
It isn't on paper yet,
but I know every word of it.
I'll skip the physical description.
- That's obvious.
- Yes.
First impression one gets
is that here's a man--
No, a brute.
Completely without feeling or thought.
A cruel, merciless creature
who kills for the sake of killing...
...who tortures for the sake of hearing
the anguished cries of his victims.
But as this first impression wears off...
...one realizes
that this is a very highly complex individual.
A mass of contradictions.
A man who is tortured by a brain
he should never have been given.
But with that brain, he is able to think.
To see clearly that all these things
he denies in other men...
...the need for respect, for dignity,
exist in himself.
Well, go ahead. You started. Finish.
The reason for his action
then becomes obvious.
Since he has found it so difficult
in the outside world...
...to maintain that dignity,
he creates a world for himself.
A ship on which he alone can be master,
on which he alone can rule.
The next step is a simple one.
An ego such as this
must constantly be fed...
...must constantly be reassured
of its supremacy.
So it feeds itself
upon the degradation of people...
...who have never known anything
but degradation.
It is cruel to people who have
never known anything but cruelty.
But to dare to expose that ego
in a world where it would meet its equal.
It's a lie.
It's a lie.
What do you want?
I....
I want you to forbid the men to laugh at me.
What?
Like....
Like Cooky.
When I first came on deck today,
he thought it was funny...
...that I should be wearing these clothes.
But it isn't funny.
It's not funny at all.
When I had my practice,
I had 20 suits like this.
Each one of them
more expensive than the other.
When I came into the hospital,
everybody would greet me with respect.
I was a person of importance.
I'd like to feel that way again.
I don't want the men to call me Louie.
I want them to say "doctor."
Dr. Prescott.
After all, I did save this woman's life.
I did show a certain amount of skill.
And I haven't had a drink in a week.
Look, my hands.
They're steady as a rock.
Do you see what I'm trying to say?
After all, I haven't much more time to go.
I'm getting pretty old.
I know I'll never get back
to private practice again.
I'll probably die a ship's doctor.
But whatever time I have left, I want
to be treated with respect like I used to be.
- All right, Louie. I'll talk to the men.
- You're a great man, Captain Larsen.
- I'll never forget this. I'll never forget this.
- Come with me.
Excuse me.
Pipe all hands. Pipe.
Now, listen, everybody.
Louie's come to me with a complaint.
He's not being treated
the way he feels he should be.
I don't want you laughing at him
or at his clothes.
- Tell them about calling me Louie.
- Oh, yes.
He's not to be called Louie anymore.
From now on, it's "doctor."
- Doctor what?
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Dr. Prescott. Dr. Louis J. Prescott.
- Yeah.
Dr. Prescott.
He's to be given all the courtesy
and respect due a physician of his standing.
That satisfactory, Dr. Prescott?
Quite satisfactory, Captain Larsen.
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.
Get away from me.
- Get away from me.
- Nice suit you got, Dr. Prescott.
Leave me alone.
Hey, go back.
Come on down here.
He's an old man. He's liable to lose his battles.
Let him come down.
Oh, no. Let him beg first.
By the time he comes off that mast,
he'll be the old Louie again.
All right, that's enough. Leave him alone.
All right, Louie. You can come down.
Come down?
To what?
Hey you!
You can go on living, living like mangy curs!
But not Louie!
Not Dr. Prescott!
I've had my fill!
Come down, Louie!
You'll regret the day
you ever tried to make a fool of Louie!
Hey, ask him why it is
this ship doesn't sail the regular ship lanes!
Why she scurries like a rat
at the sight of another boat!
- Come down!
- When I'm good and ready!
You won't answer any
of these questions, will you, Larsen?
Well, I will!
This ship is a scavenger!
A scavenger!
And Larsen's the worst scavenger
of them all!
A sealing vessel? Ha!
Yes, there'll be skins of seals
onboard this boat!
But they'll be the skins
he steals from other men!
From his brother! Yes, from his own brother!
Ha!
I know. Stealing doesn't mean anything
to men like you.
But losing your lives does!
And that's the price he's gonna pay
for those skins. Your lives!
There will be less of you come back
from this voyage alive than went on it.
I can promise you that.
Hey, Larsen!
Tell him about your brother, Death Larsen!
Tell them about the fear that comes
into your heart at the mention of his name.
I fear no man. No man!
Tell them about the oath
he's taken to kill you.
Tell them about his ship, the Macedonia.
Tell them about the cannon he's got onboard it.
Primed to blow you, your boat,
and all onboard to kingdom come!
Louie, come down!
I'll come down in my own way!
Hey, look.
There's a price no man will pay for living.
It was an accident. He slipped.
- What do you want?
- Mr. Johnson told me where you were.
What they done to you, how they beat you.
I came to see if I could help.
I don't need any help.
I can take care of myself.
I always have, I always will.
- Leave me alone.
- Thought you might like a cigarette.
- I said, leave me alone.
- Well, it wasn't my fault.
- Nobody asked you to play hero for me.
- Shut up.
Nobody's blaming you.
And don't get any ideas in your head either,
why I went after Larsen.
He can't stand to see a dog beg,
much less a human being.
Now, beat it.
I said, beat it.
I'm....
I'm sorry.
I had to let my hate out on somebody,
and you happened to come along.
- Didn't you ever feel that way?
- You're hurt bad, aren't you?
Larsen does a good job.
Look, why don't you try and get some rest?
No, no.
I tried that. It don't work.
When I close my eyes, I see Larsen
grinning at me, laughing at me.
I wake up trying
to wipe that grin off his face.
When I keep my eyes open,
my mind is clear.
I can think about what I'm gonna do.
Hold it, will you?
Listen. That's the kid.
Whenever he's sad, he plays that harmonica.
He makes up the songs.
He's good, ain't he?
I guess he's playing that one for Louie.
Louie.
I liked Louie.
He was decent.
Fat, old, drunken Louie.
He was so proud
of them fancy clothes of his too.
Poor Louie.
Lucky Louie.
I don't think so.
Well, it's all over for him.
All the heartaches and the pains.
Supposing I said to you
I can get you off this boat.
It don't make any difference to me anymore.
You gotta fight. You can't quit.
- Tomorrow, I'll be on my feet. Tomorrow--
- Tomorrow will be like today.
And the day before.
He'll only beat you up again, and you know it.
What I got inside me,
Larsen can never get at.
- That's what drives him crazy.
- What? What is it?
I don't know.
I can't explain it.
It's something in me,
and it tells me I gotta keep on fighting.
It tells me that there is something
for people like us.
- Like us?
- Yeah. Like us.
Men like Larsen can't keep on
grinding us down because we're nobodies.
That ain't true. We're somebodies. Look.
I-- I got a plan all worked out in my mind.
I'll get even with Larsen,
and we'll get off this boat.
- We?
- Yeah, we.
You and I and anybody else
who wants to go.
- We can all be free if it works.
- And if it don't work, you might be killed.
You said it before.
What have we got to lose?
You don't have to go back to the States.
There's an iron gate waiting there
to shut me in too.
Oh....
Inside or out, it's all the same.
To be free.
To be let alone.
To live in peace.
Even if only for a little while.
Like this.
I don't expect that anymore.
Mr. Svenson was looking for you, sir.
Svenson? What did he want?
I don't know, sir. I saw him going down
towards the fo'c'sle.
- Why are you standing the watch alone?
- Harrison isn't feeling very well, sir.
All right.
Svenson.
Aye, sir?
Uh, Johnson said you wanted to see me.
I didn't wanna see you.
- The attacks are getting worse, ain't they, sir?
- I didn't ask for your opinion.
- Now, where do you think you're going?
- I'm going for a walk on deck.
- I can't sleep.
- Oh, sensitive soul, ain't you?
Hey, careful on deck
that the ghost of Louie...
...don't come jumping down at you
from the main mast.
What do you want?
I wanted to talk to her.
- Leave her alone.
- She was crying.
- She was crying on deck too.
- There was nothing I could do.
There's nothing you can do now.
- What had to be done has been done.
- Leach...
...I wish you would believe me.
I'd like to help you.
We don't need your help.
- We?
- Yeah, we.
All we have to do to get off this boat
is to flap our wings and fly away.
Yeah, we got wings.
Jailbirds' wings.
Good night, Van Weyden.
Good night, Leach.
Yes?
- Who is it?
- It's me.
You can stop your crying now.
It's over. It's done with.
Don't you understand me?
It's over. It's done with.
Steady. There's no time for that now.
I'll be all right.
Soon, we'll be off this hell ship.
- We'll forget we were ever onboard it.
- When?
- When?
- A few days, maybe a week.
It'll take time before Johnson and me
can load that boat with supplies.
We got a long, tough trip ahead of us,
1500 miles on open boat.
But we'll make it, I tell you. We'll make it.
Yeah.
If I don't jinx you.
Don't say that, you hear me? Don't say that.
My arm. You're hurting me.
I didn't mean to grab you that tight.
You made me mad.
That's the arm where they...?
My blood.
Yeah.
Your blood.
I can't take any more chances. I gotta go.
Good night.
No more tears.
No more.
Stay on that wheel.
- How long have you been on deck?
- I've just come up.
- Did you see anybody come from the fo'c'sle?
- No, sir.
You're probably lying.
Come with me.
- Johnson.
- Yes, sir?
You saw what happened on this deck
a while ago?
- I saw nothing, sir.
- Svenson and I were slugged...
- ...and thrown overboard.
- My eyes were on the course.
- Who did it, Johnson?
- I told you, sir. I know nothing.
Svenson's probably dead.
- I'll need a new mate. You can have his job.
- I wouldn't make a good mate, sir.
I don't know how to give orders.
I only know how to take them.
Come with me.
- You're not going down into the fo'c'sle?
- Yes.
- How will you know who did it?
- Don't worry, I'll know. Go ahead.
I've got Larsen.
All right, let him go, kid.
Now we're in for it.
You.
You put us up to it.
It was your idea to throw him overboard.
If you only handed me a knife, I had him.
I had him in my hands.
I would've put an end to him.
You weren't thinking of us
when you gave us the idea.
You were thinking of you and that jailbird.
- Hey.
- Be a man, he says. Stand up for your rights.
Stand up for him he meant.
What difference does it make who our master is
and what kind of ship we sail?
Get rid of Larsen.
There's a dozen that'll take his place.
Stop bellyaching.
You should've thought of that before.
Well, I didn't. I'm thinking of it now.
- I'll tell him who put us up to it.
- You don't have to tell him. I'll tell him myself.
And if I have to, I'll go out like Louie,
thumbing my nose at him.
You've all forgotten about Louie,
haven't you?
You're too busy worrying
about what will happen to you.
Nothing will happen to you.
He needs you to sail a ship.
He needs you to break your backs for him.
Maybe someday, you'll get wise to that.
Van Weyden.
Van Weyden, are you down there?
- No, he isn't.
- Yes.
Yes, I'm here.
You better come up quick.
The old man wants you in his cabin.
If you so much as open your mouth....
I've seen and heard nothing.
Remember that.
Now you guys got something else
to worry about.
I want the names
of the men who were in on this.
You shall have them.
The leader, how the thing was worked out,
and what they intended doing with the ship.
- You think you can get me all that?
- Have I ever failed you, sir?
Sterling character, isn't he?
That's his profession. Being a stool pigeon.
Cooking is only a hobby.
How you could've accused such a character
of stealing your money--
Did he say that, sir?
Oh, the liar. The dirty, sniveling liar.
I dare you to repeat it to my face.
I said you were the only one
who could have taken the money.
Lay a hand on me again, I'll kill you.
Do it now, Van Weyden. Go ahead.
Stick the knife into him.
Is this the first time you ever wanted
to commit a murder?
Good feeling, isn't it, huh?
To know you hold a man's life in your hands.
You enjoyed it, didn't you?
I think I know now why men call you Wolf.
Yeah, you know a lot of things now
you didn't know before.
You've changed. I told you, you would.
You're not the gentleman you were
when you came onboard.
Oh, no. You've become more
like the rest of them.
Like me.
A brutal, callous and inhuman creature.
I bet you think nothing now of turning
that knife on me if I were to reach out.
You're mad, Larsen.
- Grab you by the throat.
- Stark-raving mad, you--
Larsen, what is it?
Oh, nothing.
I think it's just a headache.
I often get them.
They come and go.
This pressure on my brain...
...if it would only leave me.
It's driving me crazy.
Four bells.
It ought to be getting light soon.
Van Weyden, open the curtains.
You heard me? I said, open the curtains.
- Van Weyden.
- Yes?
Where are you going?
I wasn't going anyplace.
You were. I heard your footsteps.
Don't lie to me.
You know, Van Weyden?
You know.
- Yes, I know.
- Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
If they find out I'm blind, they'll come up here
and kill me. I won't have a chance.
It'll go away in a little while.
It always does.
And then I'll be able to see again.
Don't tell them.
Don't tell them.
Pity, Van Weyden.
Pity.
Closer.
Come nearer to me.
That's it.
Pity, Van Weyden.
Pity.
You fool. You had your chance,
but you lost it.
Now you'll have to stay here with me
until my eyesight comes back again.
I was wrong.
You haven't changed.
You haven't changed a bit.
All right. Let's get it over with.
I have here in my pocket a list.
A list of the names of all of the men
who were part of this plot to kill me.
I know exactly how it was started, who led it,
and what you intend to doing with the ship.
An ingenious plan, a daring plan.
If it had succeeded, Mr. Leach.
You had other plans too, didn't you?
Something about, uh, escaping in a boat.
Do you know what I'm going to do
with this list?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
I know exactly how you felt.
What Louie told you the other day
was absolutely true, every word of it.
I have no intentions of hunting any seals.
I leave that to my brother.
Sure, my brother has cannon onboard.
Sure, he's got them primed
to sink the Ghost.
Sure, there's a chance of all of you
going down with the ship.
But also, there's just as good a chance
that you won't.
And that means we'll get a cargo of seal skins
the likes of which you've never seen before.
You see, that's the joke. We steal them
from the same people who buy them.
Certainly, you have no scruples
against stealing...
...if you get your share of the loot.
Louie didn't tell you that, did he?
And you will get your share.
If this voyage turns out well...
...you'll each have enough to keep you
for the rest of your lives. I promise.
Van Weyden, open up the liquor stores
for the men. Give them all they want.
Oh, yes.
There's one more thing
I feel I ought to warn you about.
You have an informer in your midst.
There's nothing I detest more
than an informer.
As evidence of my good faith,
I'm gonna tell you who he is.
Cooky gave me this list.
- Cooky?
- Cooky?
Gee, damn it. You black-hearted devil!
Get that squealer.
Get him.
Let me go. Let me go.
Shark! Shark astern!
Get him over the railing now.
Better tie up what's left of his leg
before he bleeds to death.
One sound and you're a dead man.
Keep your voice low.
The key to the supply closet, where is it?
- It's in the pocket of that coat.
- Get it, Johnson.
See if it fits.
It fits.
All right, get the stuff.
- You're escaping?
- No, we're inspecting the galley.
We wanna see how clean you keep it.
Take me with you.
If I stay onboard this ship any longer,
I'll go mad.
You won't stay on this ship much longer.
- You're going on a trip, a long one.
- Put that knife back.
- Take care of the stuff, I'll take care of him.
- Leave him alone.
We can't take the chance of him
shooting his mouth off to Larsen.
- You can trust him.
- Aboard this ship, I wouldn't trust my mother.
What was that?
- Get in that closet.
- And be caught like a rat? Not me.
Come on. Get in there.
Van Weyden.
Who's down here with you?
No one.
No one's down here with me.
I thought I heard the sound of voices.
Must be the men in the fo'c'sle.
They're kind of noisy tonight.
Yes.
Yes, I guess you're right.
Must have been the men.
Did you see my mate?
I've been looking all over. He's probably drunk
someplace like the rest of them.
Guess I'll have to take the wheel myself.
What's that noise?
What noise?
Didn't you hear the sound of a ship's siren
off in the distance?
I didn't hear any siren.
You must be mistaken.
You sure you didn't?
That's funny.
All night long, I keep hearing the sound
of a ship's siren coming closer and closer.
Guess I'll go up on deck.
Now. Now is the time for you to escape.
- Now? With him at the wheel?
- He won't see you.
- He won't see you.
- What are you talking about?
Don't ask me questions.
Go before it's too late.
- He can't see you, I tell you. He's blind.
- He's blind?
I was with him when he had one
of these attacks before.
It takes several hours to go away. By that time,
you'll be off the boat, you'll be safe.
Van Weyden, you could have given us away.
You didn't.
You're wasting time.
Johnson, get this stuff in the boat.
Do you still wanna go with us?
- Yes.
- I'll go get Ruth.
I can't help feeling he's staring right at us.
That he can see us.
He can't see, I tell you. He can't.
All ready. Come on.
- I'm not going.
- What?
No, I'm not going. You go without me.
I'm a jinx. Everything I ever touched,
everything I ever done...
...always turned out wrong.
You'll never make it with me onboard.
- Something will happen.
- Are you getting in?
Oh, no. Go without me, will you?
Please, go without me.
How far have we gone?
We haven't gone very far yet.
We've only been sailing about six hours.
We still got quite a trip ahead of us.
But with a good wind and a little bit of luck,
we'll make it.
I'll fix some grub.
She'll be up soon.
"Pleasant journey. Wolf Larsen."
He filled the water kegs with vinegar.
I guess there's no use trying the others.
We've still got the one
we brought with us last night.
- Two gallons of water, 1500 miles to go.
- Shut up, son.
If we're careful, we'll make it.
Two gallons of water, 1500 miles to go.
- Four people.
- Four people.
I tell you, if we manage well, we'll make it.
And I tell you we will make it.
So you think you tricked us, don't you?
Sure, I can see you sitting on that deck
laughing at us...
...but that laugh will choke in your throat,
because we'll make it.
Water or no water, we'll make it.
Do you hear me, Larsen? We'll make it.
Captain Larsen, the number two dory,
it's missing, sir.
- I know.
- Leach, Johnson, the girl, Van Weyden.
- I know that too.
- They couldn't have gone very far.
- We can still head them off.
- There's no hurry.
We'll pick them up in a few days.
It's a steamer. It looks like--
My brother's ship, the Macedonia.
He's caught up to me.
They'll soon catch up to us.
We might give them the slip
if we make for that fog bank.
- Fog bank?
- Yes. There is one ahead of us.
Off the starboard bow, sir. Can't you see it?
Yes. Yes, the fog. I see it.
Make for the fog bank off the starboard bow.
Head straight into it.
- Tell him to keep steady as she goes.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Hold steady as she goes.
- They've sighted us, sir.
- No, they haven't.
They're just shooting blind.
We'll lose them in another minute.
I'm sorry, sir.
There's no place else for me to be.
I was afraid to be below deck.
We'd start to sink.
Shut up. We're not gonna sink.
I know. No, we're not, sir.
I know you'll pull us through, sir.
If that brain of yours has any schemes
in it like giving away our position?
Oh, not me, sir.
I wouldn't do anything like that.
- Smoke.
- Aye, sir.
- Make sure that he doesn't.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Look out!
- That one got us, sir.
- Shall I order the boats lowered?
No.
No man leaves this ship
until I give the word.
As long as we're afloat,
we've still got a chance.
Get a man aloft!
Keep a sharp lookout!
He's blind.
He's blind.
He's blind, I tell you. The beggar's blind!
He's blind!
The beggar's blind!
No, not that way!
Wait a minute. Let me show you.
Take the tiller.
Try and keep her as she is.
I need you to mash that mud
while I try and take a reef.
Ruth, no!
No!
Now, tie her to the mast with a rope.
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you.
Swear you won't try anything like that again.
- Could you swear?
- No.
Ruth, Ruth.
- Listen to me.
- I don't wanna listen.
- If you three make it--
- Four. Either we all make it, or none of us do.
Johnson, Van Weyden.
They got something to look forward to.
You too. You can still make a new life
for yourself someplace.
You. You, how about you?
All right, here it is.
We'll make land.
Maybe I'll get to Hong Kong
or to Singapore.
I've been there before.
I know my way around.
All right, nobody will spot me.
I won't have to go back to jail.
How do you think I'll get along?
How do you think I'll live?
- Shut up.
- You asked me.
All right, now I tell you.
When we get to land, if we get there,
I'll make a living for you.
You'll stay with me.
We'll be married.
- What?
- I said, we'd be married.
We'll start from scratch, both of us.
There's a spot some place for us
in the world, and we'll find it.
Johnson.
Johnson.
Johnson!
Van Weyden, Ruth.
A ship.
I see a ship.
Stop rowing, Leach.
The ship we're heading for is the Ghost.
Look.
The boats, they're all gone.
Where are you going?
Aboard the Ghost.
There's food and water on that ship.
- Enough to make it a sure thing for us.
- Oh, no. Don't.
There's nobody on that boat.
Can't you see, she's sinking?
- The boats are gone.
- But Larsen?
He probably saved his own skin first.
You stay here with Humphrey.
I'll lower the stuff down to you.
Open that door.
George.
George!
George!
George!
- Maybe we better go onboard.
- Yeah.
Leach!
Leach, where are you?
Here, I'm here.
Can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
- Oh, then listen.
- This is no time for words now.
Listen to me. There isn't a chance
of breaking this door down in time.
- Oh, we'll find a way.
- I got stuff piled out there, food and water.
I had it all ready
when Larsen came behind me.
I didn't even have a chance to holler.
Get the stuff, put it on the dory.
- But what's gonna happen to you?
- Don't stand there wasting time.
Get off this ship before he gets you too.
Get off it.
The ship's sinking. You'll drown.
I'll drown. My number's up.
I knew it the minute I came onboard.
There's got to be a way
to get you out of here. There's got to.
Sure. Larsen's got the key.
All you gotta do is ask him for it.
- All right. I'll get it.
- No.
Please, stay away from him.
He's not only blind, he's mad.
If you ever get near those hands of his,
he'll tear you to pieces. You gotta live.
Not without you.
Van Weyden, make her go with you.
Stay here.
I'll get the key from Larsen.
Van Weyden. Van Weyden, come back.
Come back.
Do you hear me? Come back. Get off this boat.
Take her with you. Van Weyden!
Ruth. Ruth.
- You still there?
- Yeah, I'm still here.
You shouldn't have stayed.
You shouldn't have stayed.
If you live, I live.
If you die, I die.
That's the way it is with me.
Funny how your saying that
makes me think of one thing.
I once went to a wedding of a friend of mine.
The part that stuck in my mind most...
...was when they both repeated
after the priest:
"For better or for worse,
for richer or for poorer...
...in sickness or in health,
to love and to cherish...
...till death do us part."
I guess we're gonna skip everything
but the last part.
Oh, no. We've crowded all of our life
together into one day.
I never even expected that much.
So if this is the way it's gotta end...
...it's all right with me.
With me too.
Come in, Mr. Van Weyden.
The door is open.
- I was expecting you.
- The key to the storeroom, I want it.
Come and take it from me.
If you take another step,
I'll blow your brains out.
That should prove to you
that I can still see.
Not very much, vaguely, just shadows,
but well enough to hit you between the eyes.
Where's Johnson?
Johnson's dead. He gave up his life.
Oh, I'm disappointed.
I thought it would be you
who would make the noble sacrifice.
Why didn't you, Mr. Van Weyden?
- The ship's sinking. There's not much time.
- I've got all the time in the world.
Answer me. Why didn't you,
Mr. Van Weyden?
All your fine words were just fine words,
weren't they? I was right all the time, wasn't I?
When you were faced with the choice,
you let Johnson die.
I understand your actions.
I would have done the same.
Yes, but once you said to me,
there's a price no man will pay for living.
What's your price?
You can come with us in the boat.
When we reach shore, I'll get you to a doctor.
He'll fix your eyes up for you,
then you'll be able to see again.
No, thank you.
I'll never be able to see again.
I know that. I've known it for a long time.
This is the finish, for my eyes, for myself.
I sink with my ship.
That should appeal to you, Mr. Van Weyden.
It's in the best literary tradition of the sea.
I, Wolf Larsen, sink with my own ship
in sight of land.
- Land?
- Yes, land.
- We're lying two miles off an island.
- I don't believe you.
It's beyond the fog bank. You'll see it
when the fog lifts. Not much of an island.
A few Japanese fishing boats
once in a while.
That's what I was heading for
when my brother caught up with me.
It's the kind of an island that Leach
and the girl dreamed about, isn't it?
Too bad Leach didn't know about it.
- Better go. She's settling fast.
- Go?
Yes, you can go. I won't stop you.
Take the girl with you.
I want you to finish writing
that book about me.
The last chapter should be a good one.
Too bad you weren't onboard
when it all happened. It was exciting.
The moment that my brother's boat sighted us,
we made a run for it. I saw you move.
We slipped through this fog bank.
For a full hour, I bluffed the crew.
Nobody onboard knew I was blind.
And Cooky, Cooky found out.
"He's blind," he yelled.
"The beggar's blind."
He called me a beggar.
And my brother fired point-blank at us.
The Ghost began to sink.
They ran for the boats.
Like rats, they ran.
You'll write all of this
in your book, won't you?
You better hurry.
Leach? What about Leach?
He goes down with me.
Why? Why?
He set the crew against me.
He once tried to kill me.
- And this is your revenge?
- Yes, yes, this is my revenge.
- I don't believe that's your real--
- I don't care.
He stays on the ship.
- He saw himself as a great figure.
- What are you talking about?
I'm reading you the last part of my book.
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
Yes.
Yes, that's it. That's what it all adds up to.
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.
He saw himself to the last,
proud, defiant, strong...
...shaking his fist at the heavens as the waters
closed over his head.
He liked this death.
It was fitting he should die this way...
...dragging his enemies down with him,
turning defeat into victory...
- ...the true death of the superman.
- Is that how it ends?
No, that's not how it ends.
There's one more paragraph.
As I stood there watching him,
I felt sorry for him.
I don't need anybody feeling sorry for me.
In a few minutes, he'd be alone,
forced to face the truth.
I know what the truth is.
He'd see himself as he really was,
a pathetic broken hulk of what was once a man.
Shut up.
Then he'd have to admit to himself
that there was nothing heroic in his death.
It was mean and petty and cheap.
- The only motivation behind all of it was fear.
- Shut up, I say. Shut up.
He was afraid to go on living, for now he had
no longer his great strength to sustain him.
Now he was helpless.
He had to go to other people and ask for help.
I remembered how he'd reacted when I told him
he wouldn't expose that ego in another world.
- Now I knew that I was right.
- That's not true.
I don't wanna hear anymore.
Do you hear me?
So this was the end of Wolf Larsen.
The pitiful, dismal, pathetic finish.
I don't wanna hear anymore.
Do you hear me?
So now you can't even see shadows.
Van Weyden?
- Where are you?
- Here at the table.
Van Weyden.
I couldn't have missed you.
I saw you. I fired right at you.
It's hard to kill the truth, isn't it, Larsen?
- I could have escaped if I'd wanted to.
- If you wanted to?
Yes, after you fired and missed,
I could have run out of the room.
That's right. You could have.
A little while ago,
you asked me what my price was.
Well, I'll tell you.
The key to that storeroom, Leach's life.
Van Weyden.
Van Weyden, answer me.
It's all right, Ruth.
Everything's going to be all right.
Stay at the door. Don't go away.
Well, what do you say, Larsen?
- I don't know what you're getting at.
- Simple.
I want to prove to you how wrong
you were about everything, even about me.
I'll strike a bargain with you.
My life for Leach's.
I'll stay here and die with you,
Leach goes free.
- Are you trying to trick me?
- Door's locked, you still got bullets in that gun.
No, it's a trick.
Nobody does anything like that for anybody
unless they get something out of it.
Maybe you think I'll unlock the door
and let you go, is that it?
Maybe you think I'll give up
my side of the bargain.
That you'll find some way that you won't have
to go down with the ship and me.
I had it all figured out. I can't be wrong.
There must be a catch to it.
There's no catch, Larsen.
I'll go down with you in the Ghost.
Shove the key through the door and see.
Are you frightened I may prove you wrong?
- It's the key to the storeroom. Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it.
Let him out quickly...
- ...before it's too late.
- But you, Van Weyden?
- What about you?
- I'll...
...meet you on deck.
Van Weyden.
Van Weyden, where are you?
Where are you, Van Weyden?
So it was a trick.
I did hit you.
I did hit you.
I knew there was a catch to it.
I knew it!
Van Weyden?
- Van Weyden.
- It's no use. It's too late.
Oh, no.
