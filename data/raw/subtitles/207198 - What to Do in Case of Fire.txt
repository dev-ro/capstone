Okay, ready?
Sound...rolling!
-Where the hell are the lights?
-Where's the switch?
-Camera...rolling!
-Group 36 Training Film.
Clapper, right?
Berlin, summer of '87.
The Allied occupation forces
rule the city.
Virtually every squat
has been evacuated.
Only one block
in the American sector...
...still defies
the Berlin Senate's eviction plan.
Machnow Street, zip code SO36.
WHAT TO DO lN CASE OF FlRE?
Machnow St. residents
have no jobs or decent homes.
They are always inebriated or
numbed by mind-altering drugs.
Many of these squatters
commit vandalism...
...others are a public nuisance.
Some actively resist arrest
by the authorities.
They are politically misguided
and sexually depraved.
They are slovenly and
jeopardize municipal hygiene.
But these young people can be helped.
They should do useful work, read a
good book or tinker with a little bomb.
Okay, folks, listen up.
An anarchist bomb attack...
...demands precision...
...and self-discipline.
Since most of you, like me,
probably cut chemistry class...
...here are the 5 golden rules...
...for any militant act of resistance.
Rule 1:
Beginners,
don't bite off more than you can chew.
Keep it simple.
Rule 2: Claiming responsibility.
No handwritten tracts...
...throw away fonts and ribbons...
...xerox copies and...
...never use your own typewriter.
Rule 3: Buy all materials...
...at large supermarket chains.
Suitable casings are canisters,
fire extinguishers...
...or a tightly sealed pressure cooker.
Rule 4:
Don't touch anything with bare hands...
...as this leaves
chemically identifiable traces.
Or rinse thoroughly.
And now our recipe
for your basic model:
Take 10 parts powdered sugar...
...extra fine...
...saltpeter from any chemistry set...
...weed killer from the local drug store.
Deoxidize to taste.
Shit on the imperialist pigs!
Rule 5:
Occupy abandoned buildings.
Failing this, leave a little reminder.
That's all for today.
Down with imperialist pigs!
Mass resistance. And remember:
What to do in case of fire?
Let it burn!
And most important, folks, timing.
Timing is everything.
This is a hot tip.
The place used to be overrun
by Americans.
ln '45 they didn't bomb Dahlem
because they wanted it for themselves.
Blockade, Cold War,
fall of the Wall.
Here, world politics always
seemed less turbulent.
Hear it?
That's historical silence.
You're the first to have a look.
Until last week, no one even knew
who owned it.
lt's been vacant since '88.
l'm dying to see it.
l sell these places sight unseen.
The location alone!
See?
With Berlin the capital,
the housing market has mushroomed.
Needs some work after
1 2 years of neglect.
But the location!
Avus, Spreebogen, just 1 5 minutes
to the government district.
Your colleagues at the Ministry
would die for it.
Step back and let a strong man
have a go.
Welcome to the new Berlin!
Attention, all units.
A bomb has exploded in Grunewald.
Man, oh, man!
Just like the good old days.
l bet they freaked.
Like that time with Haig, remember?
Power to the people, and all that.
-The way it used to be, huh?
-Yeah, except you didn't use to be so fat.
And up l go.
Guys, wait!
-No time, Bülent.
-l need to talk to you.
We've got work to do, Bülent.
l can't demolish the place
while you're still in here.
Looks like you got a crappy deal.
Not our fault you got took.
Yes, well....
l'll make you an offer:
A place for the two of you
in Wedding. Newly tiled!
Wedding? No way.
Now Grunewald, that's a different story.
Are you nuts?
What about my rent?
Check's in the mail.
-l'll kick you out on the street!
-Yeah, right.
There's no way he can
get us out of here.
l talked to the
Tenant Rights Association.
Bülent can't do that
to a handicapped fellow citizen.
And if l'm good at anything,
it's sitting tight.
A trial can drag on for 4 or 5 years.
He won't last that long.
We can hold out longer.
You'll see.
We'll still be here on Machnow St.
when we're 50.
Can you lend me a 20?
We close in 10 minutes.
Thank you for shopping with us.
A few hours ago a bomb went off
in Berlin, leaving people terrified.
A villa in Grunewald was destroyed
by unknown perpetrators.
Miraculously,
only 2 people suffered minor injuries.
Commissioner,
any recent developments?
lt was those anarchists
sabotaging building projects.
We'll pay a visit to every left-wing
fanatic in town.
Crack down on every hangout.
-ls that legal?
-Any other questions?
Commissioner, any concrete
leads on the suspects?
Tonight Judge Niemeyer will issue
any necessary search warrants.
And if any left-wing creeps
start in about human rights...
...arrest them.
Get out of my face!
Got a phone card?
Mine's used up.
No, sorry.
lt's urgent.
-You can use my phone, l live over there.
-l can?
Anti-Cement Brigade strikes again.
We've liberated the mall...
...to protest the capitalist pigs
on Potsdam Square...
...the razing of low-rent housing
by multinationals.
Down with the police state.
Furthermore....
All power to the imagination!
Unit 1, Kreuzberg.
Unit 2, Friedrichsheim.
Unit 3, Prenzlauer Berg.
Reinforcements may be necessary.
Exercise caution with Machnow St.
hoodlums whose subversive tricks...
...include pushing heavy or
burning objects out of windows.
Take quick action.
Shit.
Holy shit!
Wire cutters.
He's up there!
-Do something, officer!
-You mind leaving?
Hey, this is my house.
Man, he hoards everything!
Unbelievable!
He can't let go.
Jesus, they turned off the gas!
Bomb Explodes
Hey, are you crazy?!
Get your paws off my papers.
That's none of your business, asshole!
Show me your badges!
Your dog leashes!
You're like a plague of locusts.
1 0 bullies against one guy.
Your receipt.
What receipt?
Fuck all of you.
Kiss my ass.
Hey, you too, asshole!
Good, get it all out.
Say, why don't you
take the guy too?
Bet he's been up to no good.
Handcuff an invalid?
The evening news'll love that.
Wait a second.
Officer...
...just a second.
Timmy, l tried,
but the pigs had me outnumbered.
-The task force is in the gym.
-Good for us.
Tell me when the lSDN lines are up.
-l forgot to tell you....
-Who's that?
l'm Dr. Henkel.
Security in Bonn sent me.
We can use every man.
l'll lend infrastructural support.
Plus, l have experience in...
...PR, data analysis,
dragnets.
Ever wonder why
the commissioner...
...chose not to
call in the National Guard...
...but to hire an old watchdog
like me?
l have actually wondered.
The cops searched the whole town,
not just our place.
But here's where
they found the evidence.
-They haven't screened the films yet.
-Once they do, we're screwed.
l say we go to Poland.
-And what about the others?
-l dunno. Not my problem.
l thought we didn't betray
our friends.
Who even knows
where they live now.
l won't set foot in that rich ghetto.
''You want a piece of the pie?
With us you take the cake.''
l want that slogan in Helvetica,
and add a line.
You keep changing the campaign around.
That's your problem.
l don't have a problem. l'm the boss.
l'm looking out for our shareholders.
We're 32 times oversubscribed.
l'm ingenious. l'm a genius.
And this junk is...
...bullshit!
Or do you disagree?
-You can't just walk in here....
-You imbeciles!
Nobody wants super glossy anymore.
Where's my Vitasprint?
Oh, man, forget it.
Off the pig!
Oh, shit.
Hotte, you old cripple!
-Maiky.
-Long time no see!
How've you been?
Hangin' in there.
Hey, and Timmy!
Wow, this is just....
What do you want?
Mama, can Sasha and Holger
come up too?
The deal was 6 kids for 6 years.
Just wait, when l'm as old as you,
l'll invite 33 friends over.
Who knows if you'll even have
that many.
lt's all in those films,
the whole operation...in close-up.
Melli, cut it out.
Stop, we're going for a walk.
Nele, did you hear me?
Oh, fudge!
Hey, are you wacko?
This can't be happening.
l put all that behind me.
l don't get it.
That stuff never blew up.
lt was a super job.
You knew your stuff, Terror.
Don't you remember?
''Stay high, be free, it's Terror A to Z.''
Can you even see me in the film?
l mean....
That wasn't even a real bomb.
We weren't the RAF!
You were!
How could you save
something like that?
Hey! We made the films
to show our kids...
...that we stood up to the pigs.
lt's just nobody cares anymore.
Except the police.
Right. That's the problem.
Preparation and deployment of a bomb,
31 0b of the penal code:
Attempted murder despite
aberratio ictus.
What the hell's that?
Despite failure to
achieve intent...
...it still carries a sentence
of at least 8 years.
8 years! But l'm a rising star!
Maybe 7, with a good lawyer.
7 years,
Melli will be 1 3 by then.
lsn't there a statute of limitations?
Not for attempted murder.
What? A memorial service
for the victims?
We got the right guys.
That real-estate broad
and the asshole from Bonn.
We almost killed 2 people.
Don't you have any feelings?
They won't suspect us. We're so
changed, l hardly recognize myself.
We'll turn ourselves in.
The lawyer sets an example
by taking the first step.
Where to? Jail?
The board is waiting.
Anything else?
Decomposition analysis of the dinitrotol
and the unburned CO2 reveals--
Herbicide, saltpeter,
sugar, the old anarchist concoction.
And get this...
...the Material Testing Department
dates the bomb elements...
...to 1 2 years ago...
...at least.
The pressure cooker came out
on the market in November 1 984.
So 1 984 to 1 988.
That's our time frame.
Not the present.
The politics might be outdated...
...but the Grunewald bomb
goes back to a time...
...when West Berlin was still an island.
Okay, people, find me
every activist from back then...
...every radical splinter group.
We'll ferret them out.
Big deal, Timmy.
So they're all assholes now.
You said so yourself.
None of them had what it takes.
You've got so much more going for you
than some stupid ad man.
-And they totally brainwashed Terror.
-Can't you ever shut up?!
Hey, remember,
l'm the only buddy you got left.
Don't forget my parka!
l couldn't even find this place anymore.
The street's full of new buildings.
And they renamed the Dimitroff.
They just go and rename it!
l have long hair now.
Flattering, isn't it?
Oh, God.
The roof still leaks.
Had a lot on my mind lately.
Haven't fixed it yet.
1 1 years!
Guess who got the case.
Manowsky.
Old Bruiser Manowsky.
He knows the scene, who we are.
We're in this together,
the others agree.
So that means someone sent you?
l thought you could go in
and get the reels.
You kept them.
We wouldn't recognize them.
Only you know which one
shows the bomb scheme.
Flo!
l can't believe it, our Flo.
That's the way it is.
l can't change things.
Tim, what about Poland?
You shut up.
l didn't say a word.
No pot in Poland, anyway.
Okay, l'll do it.
Good.
What's with the other idiots?
Oh, shit.
Welcome to my humble abode.
What's that smell?
Good to see you again, kid.
Liar.
True, asshole.
Man, just like the good old days.
We'll show those pigs, eh?
-l'm not using violence.
-l've only got till Friday.
l'm not breaking any laws.
But l am!
Looks like we got a little
heavy-duty S.W.A.T. team.
We're going in for what's ours.
What exactly is it we're doing?
We're breaking into
the police barracks.
The complex dates back to
the Nazi era...
...and was built over
a Prussian regiment barracks.
8000 men used to be
stationed here.
One day only 1 7 men returned from
battle. A nasty turn of events.
We enter at the dormitory level,
no barbed wire.
Here's the weak point.
They'll have guards posted.
What about exits?
Hardly any information leaks out.
But l turned up some old records.
Really?
The perimeter measurements
have changed.
Standby units are stationed inside.
1 00 men, round-the-clock duty.
How'd you find that out?
Wiggle your ass a little
and they all turn to putty.
Men are so dumb.
Okay, women are no better.
We'll never get through
the l.D. check at the gate.
Hotte, stop!
Don't! What are you doing?
My dog, Richard, got loose.
l think he's in there.
Could l maybe...?
Just this once....
Thanks.
Richard!
The place is a fortress.
Armored doors, tanks,
water cannons.
Oh, yeah,
and another thing...
...attack dogs.
lt's nice spending time with
people outside the toddler group.
What a big doo-doo.
Nele, what's with you?
Doo-doo? Toddler groups?
You were the best.
l always thought you'd become
someone great.
A kind of Rosa Luxemburg or...
...at least a circus director.
But l did.
lt's all hormones,
nesting instinct and so on.
First, you embrace the world, then...
...you cash in your parents'
savings bonds, get a job....
Where's their father?
Just got it 4 years ago!
After 4 years everything falls apart.
lt has been confirmed
that one of the two injured persons...
lt has been confirmed
that one of the two injured persons...
...was indeed a government employee.
Some more?
So now you can go to
night school via lnternet.
-l did it myself.
-Or coffee?
l'll lend you my old notes.
Lend me the rum instead.
So who's taking
the early shift tomorrow?
l have to review a detention order at 9,
plus l'm getting a cold.
l have to pamper
my board of directors.
-l'm busy too.
-Doing what, if l may ask?
l just can't.
You do it.
l did it today.
Besides, l have the kids.
-Then get a babysitter.
-For 1 5 marks an hour? l'm not loaded.
l'll pay for it. How many hours?
Hey, where do you get off?
You can't buy me.
Did you see that?
She wants to buy me. Mankind does not
exist for your benefit alone.
Quiet, the kids.
l'm aware of that.
How do we get into that fortress?
We let experts handle it.
Outsourcing is the key. Pros!
We get 40 men from across the Oder...
...they grab the film and return to
Romania the same night.
250,000.
That's a cut-rate price.
Great idea, and 6 months later,
when the cash is gone, they're back.
And your 40 pros
are suddenly 40 witnesses.
-So we write them a check.
-Can you be serious?
Okay, Mr. Stuffed Shirt,
you got a better solution?
-Yes, we turn ourselves in.
-No one's turning himself in.
Next suggestion.
We drop down from above.
We float in on an air balloon.
l rode in one for my birthday once.
We land, grab the film,
and take off.
Sure, and we live happily ever after.
That's kiddy crap.
What's crap about it?
Us in a balloon!
The idea's not so bad.
ln theory, okay:
Go in, grab the film, fine.
But in a balloon?
Get real!
From inside!
This time we use the system.
lt's a typewritten message.
Probably using a common...
...portable typewriter...
...duplicated, no fingerprints.
The letter was signed ''Group 36.''
We're unfamiliar with this gang.
When did the police get the note?
April 8.
April 8?
1 987.
-And what did the police do?
-ln the '80s...
...we often got
1 0 notes a week like this.
And you never reacted to any?
These do-it-yourself jobs
didn't usually detonate.
Why did this one?
ls this all
your task force has turned up?
That's all up to now.
No further comment.
We ran a typographic-linguistic analysis
of the note.
We're dealing with dangerous,
determined and brutal terrorists.
Their use of technical jargon
suggests college education....
l bet something got stuck
in the sucking thingie.
There are also
marked fecal references.
The syntax reflects
hallucinogenic excess.
lndeed, the prose seems
indicative of substance abuse.
And don't forget:
These people believe in a cause,
making them unpredictable.
Thank you.
The press conference is over.
Nice speech.
Could you repeat it for our viewers?
Perhaps in an exclusive interview.
ATV Berlin.
Shooting's tomorrow, but without you,
it would fall short of its potential.
That might be possible.
You can't snub the press.
lt's about the citizen's subjective
sense of security. Psychology.
The success of a task force
depends on PR.
We've got to work hand in hand
with the press.
Cooperation helps.
l disagree.
No press, effective immediately.
They forgot my
double portion of ginger.
Deduct it.
That'll be 1 80.
Make it out for 300.
Tax evasion is
how l screw the state now.
You're such an asshole.
Hey, can you write copy?
You've got a way with words.
And can't you ever
take anything seriously?
-No, can you?
-Yes, l can. l take my family seriously.
l try to teach my kids
not to grow up like you...
...a small daily battle
not to forsake our old beliefs.
But l can still look in the mirror.
How nice.
But what do you see?
Cut it out, Maik.
Why gang up on me?
lt's not like l wear creased pants.
At least l'm entertaining.
You are so pathetic.
l love my company...
...l love my penthouse in New York,
l love my German maid...
...and l love my cell phone.
Yes, speaking.
Fine.
Thank you very much.
9 a.m. tomorrow
at the police barracks...
...a TV crew will be covering
the special task force.
TV ninnies!
We could join them!
Hotte, l'm afraid we're the crew.
We'll shoot a little TV report,
and while we're at it...
...check out the seized property.
We pass the reels, grab 'em.
Tim said no one suspects us.
Next.
And wear some decent clothes.
Still calling the shots, huh?
How do you think l got ahead?
l learned the hard way:
Endless philosophizing in that dump....
Now l manipulate talk
for my own ends.
And the other guy thinks...
...it was his idea all along.
Let's go.
Another guy worked for an airline,
so l could fly all over cheap....
Australia, Panama...
...but Africa's my favorite.
You'd like the desert.
lt's gigantic, endless,
with no fences or anything.
And at night it's freezing.
You lie on a rock,
looking up at the sky...
...overcome by the feeling
that the stars belong to you.
l wouldn't mind seeing a desert.
Maybe when this is all over...
...we could go there together.
l just have to take care of Hotte.
Strange, guys always want to
go away with me.
-What's so strange about that?
-l should just stay put for a while...
...because....
l'm good at staying put too.
Don't!
Wouldn't dream of it.
lt took so long to forget you.
For you.
Break what breaks you.
lsn't that how it went?
Come on!
Break what breaks you!
Break what breaks you!
You're always against things,
never for anything.
l'm tired of living from day to day
with no tomorrow.
l don't want to travel with you or sleep
with you on any more filthy mattresses.
So we stay in a hotel.
You don't know anything about me.
Yes, l'll be right home.
What the hell?
The films were our best work.
The ad agency stuff
was just recycled ideas.
What do you want?
l brought you something.
You can keep that shit.
You've been here all along?
You knew where to find me.
All you had to do was stop by.
-lt was over long before the evictions.
-Nothing was over.
You and me,
we could have made a difference.
Why do you pretend you never thought
or felt that?
Stop. lt's pathetic.
What's pathetic about it? This used
to be our city, the city of our dreams.
Filthy and fucked up, but we
could always see the horizon.
That was 1 1 years ago, Tim. How long
do you want to run around like this?
Till you're 40 and your bleached hair
is falling out?
Make something of yourself!
You're wasting your life.
Spare me your capitalist bullshit.
No mind games.
l don't want to be like you.
Don't want to or can't?
Terror
FlLMS FOR FREE AND FREEDOM
There they are.
Group 36.
Group 36.
-What kept you?
-Couldn't find a babysitter.
-What?
-No babysitter!
-Where's Tim?
-Beats me.
-And Flo?
-Has she ever been on time?
Great!
Anyone else lose their bus ticket?
-l'm going in alone.
-Me too.
Sorry, man, but you're missing
two requirements.
Could you do me a favor
and watch Melli and Leander?
l'll be right back.
Bye.
-l'm with them.
-Can l see some l.D.?
Look at you!
-He looks good.
-l look good.
Sorry l'm late. Henkel.
We're swamped with work.
That's okay, TV crews are
used to waiting. We're pros.
This is the best cameraman
we could get.
Shall we?
Well then....
Here comes Flo.
You lost out, baby.
Group 36 was a political film club
in Kreuzberg.
The anarchists intercut stolen footage
with their own propaganda, etc.
We need event calendars,
police registration...
...a data check on
social security numbers, etc.
That Fed jerk'll come in handy.
Where is he, anyway?
Here are our standby units.
We can mobilize these men immediately.
The Senate's goal is to
instill a sense of security in citizens.
Hey, Uncle Hotte,
where are your legs?
The police stole them.
Just took them away?
That's mean.
-l know what Nele's doing in there.
-What?
Finding your legs.
And seized evidence....
Where do you keep that?
The basement.
Are you interested in that?
We're interested in everything.
-Where's Henkel?
-Showing some journalists around.
l explicitly told him....
Confiscated evidence is stored
alphabetically by street name...
...and analyzed systematically.
Just a second.
Not now!
My men work 24/7...
...to clean up Berlin.
And what about the anarchists?
What do you mean?
Where do they go
once the city's cleaned up?
Wanna know?
ln work camps.
Could we...?
As such, the bombing
wasn't that bad.
Yeah, as such.
They deserved it, anyway, that real-estate
broad and the asshole from Bonn.
What was the name of your station?
Well, l think
we've got enough info.
Thanks for your help.
What?
Don't close them!
-You're such an asshole.
-That was that old bastard Manowsky!
-You couldn't keep quiet?
-Terror, drive!
You idiot!
Leave Tim alone.
Pardon me, princess.
Where were you?!
-l was a bit delayed.
-Just like the old days...
...the going gets tough
and you get going.
Can't you step on it?!
Nele, you're just jealous.
Jealous of what? That you
get everything on a silver platter?
l work hard, honey.
Nele, tone down those brats!
What's wrong?
-The cops are behind us.
-Get going!
They'll throw us in jail.
We're criminals.
Drive! What are you waiting for?!
-lt's red.
-lt's red?
lt's red.
Drive, you idiot,
we're on the lam!
-l'm not breaking any traffic laws.
-Radical M, Hotte speaking.
Your kind is to blame
for the Third Reich.
Not a good moment....
They'll get us!
We're guilty, friends,
we're all guilty!
Are you nuts?
Drive, for chrissakes!
Just like our marriage:
First the fights, then the silence.
She got the kids and the summer house.
The terrible guilt
weighing on our consciences!
Come back, you stupid idiot!
Robert!
l just can't.
-lt doesn't matter.
-Yes, it does!
l know l'm weird.
l always was.
But who cared on Machnow St.?
l was just crazy Terror, the wimp...
...and he belonged too.
Come here.
Leave me alone, okay?
Just leave me alone.
l saw the reels in the crate.
l'd say we've got a day or two.
Maybe the cops are already at my office.
Hello, get me Schmitz.
Listen, l can't talk now.
When the stock hits 90, sell.
l thought if anyone could get us out,
it'd be you.
Are we all going to jail?
We'll build another one.
Another one just like it.
We'll build another bomb
and blow up the evidence!
-We're not jeopardizing human life.
-No one's around Friday night.
Can someone lend me a 20 for a taxi?
This isn't funny, not at all.
l'll pay you back.
Come on, Melli.
You're a psychiatric case.
How could l have ever
shared that decrepit shower with you?
That's the absolute sickest idea
l've ever heard.
And l love sick ideas.
lt'll work. A challenge!
l'm in.
Are we nuts?
No, never!
Never! Come on, Melli.
l need search warrants for 350 people...
...everyone who lived on Machnow St.
Security data check, dragnet,
the works, like before.
Those days are over.
News like that spreads fast...
...and if things go wrong,
the press'll fry me.
l'm under so much pressure.
6 people duped that Fed schmuck
to spy on my investigations.
Bring me solid evidence.
lt was 1 2 years ago!
There is no evidence.
l can't catch them red-handed!
One perhaps boring detail:
How do we get the bomb in?
The same way the film got in.
The Trojan horse, 1 3th century B.C.,
greatest packaging coup...
...in advertising history.
All downhill after that!
Sounds okay,
but say the crate's in the cellar...
...how do we make sure
the reels explode?
We send someone in.
Who's going to fit in there?
A kid maybe.
Very funny.
Nobody fits in.
You saw how it works.
They'll put the crate
next to the letter M and boom.
Nele, l can't sleep.
Melli, let's try something new.
You're the kid and l'm the grown-up.
l give orders and you shut up.
Okay guys, Chapter 7:
How to Build a Bomb.
What's wrong with it?
l can't get it open.
-Twist it.
-l'm trying. Got any pliers?
Keep trying.
Pliers.
Careful!
lt won't budge.
Hey, does anyone know if it was
one- or two-thirds ammonium nitrate?
Just dump a bunch in.
Good for the nerves.
1 00% organic.
This is beneath me...
...but good.
Okay, we're ready.
Let's try force.
On three: One.
Two.
Three!
ls this the police?
Could you send a patrol car?
The pinkos are stirring up
the neighborhood!
No idea,
something about ''Anti-Cement.''
Anti-Cement!
Machnow Street.
My God, Terror, your hair!
Ready for anything.
-Wow!
-Nele, you were one tough cookie.
-The cops are on their way.
-Look, it's Tim!
Uncle Hotte, your legs.
Your legs are back!
That's right, Melli.
l still had my legs that day.
And the next day they were gone.
One day you've got legs,
the next day they're gone!
One day you've got friends,
the next day they're gone!
You all split...
...when the fuckin' water cannon
ran me over!
lt was war, man!
lt was war! And you deserted!
You ran away like cowards!
Assholes!
Tim was the only one who stayed.
Assholes!
Calm down.
Pull yourself together.
Your blood sugar's low, that's all.
lt wasn't all in vain.
No, it wasn't all in vain.
Our cause still matters.
Hey, the bad times are over.
Everything'll be like before.
Trust me.
C'mon, everyone.
Take to the roof!
The roof? Great idea,
and just leave Hotte behind?
No, no, it's cool.
Don't worry.
They never take me.
Too controversial.
True, they always leave him.
Time to go.
Get moving!
-Take care, Hotte!
-l will.
Venceremos!
Officers, there's been a mix-up.
We're colleagues. l can prove it.
Get that camera out of here.
Get that damn camera away.
Get rid of that fucking camera.
-That was close.
-lt'll all be over in 4 hours.
That's it.
Come on, Melli.
We're still a helluva team.
Now we gotta stick together.
-Great, l'll have you all over for pizza.
-l meant, we can all live together.
Like before,
so nobody's lonely.
Next Thursday....
-Tim, we all have jobs to do.
-So?
We shouldn't be seen together for a while.
Say, for the next 1 4 years.
We don't know each other
and never have.
-You could have put that differently.
-No, you gotta tell it like it is.
That's cool.
Come on, let's go.
l can't.
So is there a wedding or what?
l always said l only have till Friday.
Friday at 9.
l was so close,
but when your own men screw you....
l'll round them up for you.
Trust me, Ralf.
l'm replacing you, Manni...
...putting Henkel in charge.
Me work for that jerk?
Out of the question.
You're eligible for early retirement.
You want me to retire?
l've just turned 60.
This is my case.
l'm about to nab them.
You can't do this to me.
Ralf, l thought we were friends.
l knew it.
Place of residence?
Machnow Street 1 2, SO36.
We'll miss you.
Shit.
But you said, ''Sell at 90.''
Okay, so l blacked out.
l wasn't myself. l was possessed.
Not now, damn it.
Get these bums off my back, okay?
Can you get the phone?
ln a minute.
Shit.
Give me a break.
l've had it.
50 marks for all your junk.
lt's worthless, face it.
Good, 1 00.
But that's it.
1 20. That's my last offer.
lt's Hotte. Hi, Terror.
Terror, pick up the phone.
Look, l'm down in the basement...
...and shit...
...l'm trapped, man.
Wait, just hear me out.
Don't keep walking away.
l'll give you 1 50
because l like you.
C'mon, it's all junk.
Where is he?
What'd you do with Hotte?
l have no idea where he is.
What?
For you.
Really.
Timmy, l can't believe it.
Where the hell are you?
lf it weren't for good old Bülent.
Hey, c'mon.
You know what l pay
for that shovel?
1 50 plus the phone,
'cause l like you.
Hey, it's a Sony.
Remember the shovel!
Hang on, Hotte.
And no long-distance calls.
l messed up.
l practiced everything.
l planned every detail.
lt got screwed up. l'm sorry.
Stay calm, l'm on my way.
l'm in big trouble.
l tried to retreat from the front.
lt won't work without you.
Hotte. He needs us.
Like he needed us
after the accident.
What's wrong?
Got any larger bills?
What?
Hurry up.
Look, l'm down in the basement.
l'm trapped, man.
Hotte needs us.
Like he needed us after the eviction.
Sometimes you get a second chance.
l want to use it.
How nice.
l went over the plans a million times.
There were emergency exits!
l figured it was my chance.
l'm scared shitless.
Remember the bucket gag
we pulled in that fancy restaurant?
What a mess we made.
All the shit on the walls.
Did that ever stink.
We had some good times, Tim.
You were always up for anything.
Funny...
...now that l'm all alone,
l tell myself...
...l should have thanked Timmy properly.
Thanks, Timmy.
You're my best buddy...
...l love you.
Shut up, man!
Why was that idiot
in the cellar, anyway?
Did anyone ask him to do that?
lf he wants to get blown up,
that's his damn business.
We're gonna rescue Hotte.
You with us or not?
That's totally insane.
We just got out of there.
Okay, then l'm an asshole,
but a free asshole.
-Do you mind? Thanks.
-Okay, who needs you?
Stop.
Make room for an asshole.
The last few years
have been really tough.
We fought like crazy...
...and we really got our asses kicked.
We're underdogs, aren't we?
You're here, at last.
Letting me blabber on....
What'd you get yourself into?
Nice pictures.
What more could you want?
What's this supposed to be?
Okay, let's go.
Or are you waiting for the others?
Don't hold your breath.
lt's every man for himself.
Don't expect your friends
to stick their necks out for you.
They'll leave you to croak.
Friendship is overrated.
The battle line isn't drawn
between left and right anymore...
...but between the winners and the
poor slobs who refused to sell out.
You're alone. Face it.
The last anti-fascist warriors.
The last of the Berlin Mohicans.
Hey, shut up.
We're so happy for you.
l'll be right back.
-Konrad!
-What's wrong?
We have to talk.
Know where you are?
l shout and 1 00 men come running.
We'll say
you want to turn yourselves in...
...and you'll get off easy.
Tell us who was involved--
Get him.
Clobber him!
Manowsky's back there.
-Don't leave me here alone.
-l have to.
This is our night!
l have no choice.
l got it!
How far do you think you'll get?
l'm a witness.
Forget him.
There's no witness.
Hey, Tim, come on.
l don't get it.
Everyone's had a screw loose
since then.
Maybe there was something
in the tear gas.
You got it right, copper.
The battle line isn't drawn
between left and right anymore...
...but between the winners and
the poor slobs who refused to sell out.
Alarm!
Let's go, men. Move it!
Alarm!
Let's go, men. Move it!
Open up!
-Shit, we're trapped.
-What now?
This is the police.
-Where the hell are we?
-Tim, where are you?
-There's gotta be a way out.
-Hold on.
Come out with your hands up.
You have 30 seconds.
-Watch out.
-Come on, give me a hand.
This is insane.
Watch out!
Look out ahead!
Shit!
Get a manhunt underway.
l want cars, helicopters,
the works. Now!
They won't get far.
Were they the ones you suspected?
That was the Machnow St. gang, right?
l can't verify that.
They were wearing masks.
Come on, Manowsky,
we'll be heroes.
You and me.
Strange,
l can't seem to remember anything.
A real blackout.
All those years on duty.
We breathed in the same stuff
as those anarchists.
Maybe there really was something
in the tear gas.
Whatever, Manowsky.
There's plenty of evidence
in the basement.
Forensics. Now.
Let's go.
Come on, hurry up.
Hold on.
Timmy, l was thinking...
...maybe l should retool, you know?
-Stand on my own two feet.
-Not a bad idea.
You know, career-wise...
...with computers and all...
...surfing,
it'd be a super opportunity.
lf l learned that, l could....
l can't take care of you forever.
What's going on?
-What to do in case of fire?
-Let it burn!
Let it burn.
Man, are you heavy for a half pint.
lt's okay, Tim.
l'll get even.
Can someone lend me a 20?
l'll pay you back, l swear.
-l should hope so, darling.
-Yeah, you're broke now too, Maiky.
lt's not too rosy on
the new...whatchacallit...uh, market.
Look at that guy!
