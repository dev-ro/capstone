ALL MONSTERS ATTACK
Out of the way!
- Minya sounds like that.
- Minya?
Minya makes a sound
like that car.
You're living.
I don't think he sounds like that.
It may not be that exactly,
but it's like that.
Son, are you going home now?
Oh, father!
I've got to work late!
Be good until mother gets home!
Okay.
I'll be good!
What is it?
I found a radio tube.
You can't keep that!
Put it back!
Hey!
We're going to have to work a little later.
Hey, are you having any
trouble with your kid?
What do you mean?
He just seems to be awfully quiet.
It's normal.
Really?
Well,
it's hard to understand kids today.
We have to take a step back.
Everyone is so hard at work that
we forget about the kids, huh?
Do you know of a solution?
I'll give up this life when i save enough
money and move us out of the city,
whenever that will be.
Get a load of this!
They found the getaway car of the crooks
who stole ¥50.000.000 by the trains!
If it was by the trains,
those crooks could have boarded
them and be anywhere by now.
¥50.000.000 yen...?
Hey, let's go play in
that building for a while.
We shouldn't.
That building is closed.
I know how to get in there!
But...
we could get in trouble.
There's no one in there.
All of the kids play here.
You were to wait for your mom...
We shouldn't.
Hey, let's go home!
We'll be alright!
Ichiro, it's Gabara!
Hurry, let's get out of here!
Sachiko,
what are you doing there?
Oh, mother!
You know you shouldn't be
playing around here.
Ichiro, you should hurry home.
Your mother will be worried.
Goodbye!
Hey, Ichiro!
I bet you stole that radio tube!
You're wrong!
I found it over there!
- Liar!
- It's true!
You can't find anything
good there!
- Well, i...
- Give it here!
He did it!
But,
i really found it over there!
If that's so,
then go over and honk the horn
on that guy's motorcycle.
That man is working!
He won't do it because
he's scared!
Do it if you want this back!
I won't!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
You're a chicken! Nyah, nyah!
All units,
the two fugitives wanted for the theft of
¥50.000.000 from the bank are still at large.
Report to headquarters for
new assignment, over.
This is car 11-5, roger.
Ichiro,
are you heading home?
Oh, Ichiro.
You'll find the key in it's usual place.
What's that?
This?
It's a new toy.
I call it a TV computer.
- A TV computer?
- Yes.
What does this computer do?
Can it do things like homework?
It stores data.
But, hey... let me show you.
Just push this button and...
"Kids, the moon is 1/50th
the size of our world. "
How about it?
Would you like
to learn more about the moon?
What do you think?
The moon is a neat place,
but there's another place
that i'd rather visit.
Where is that?
Monster Island.
Monster Island?
Minya lives there, along with Godzilla,
Rodan and Kumonga.
All of them live there.
And they all beat up on Gabara.
Gabara?
What monster is named that?
He's someone that
always wants to fight.
Oh, you mean that kid in
school you call Gabara.
Was he picking on you again?
Today, he took away a
radio tube i found.
Why don't you stand up to him?
I would,
but he'll knock me down.
If he knocks you down,
you just get back up and try again.
But, it's hard when you're
small like me.
Yoichi, it would be great it you could
put all of the monster sounds in here.
See you later!
I see.
All of the monster cries, huh?
What monster's voice
was that just now?
It was mine!
What?
Is that all?
"Ichiro, do your homework
before you play. "
"I left some cake in the cupboard.
I'll fix dinner when i get home. "
"Mother. "
With the signing of the world treaty,
it now goes to the United States
Congress for ratification.
And now for some local news.
Police are still looking for the two men
who robbed ¥50.000.000 from a bank.
Today, they were inspired by
the clues left behind.
The criminals abandoned
their getaway car in an alley,
and police believe they may
still be in the area.
The police will conduct door-to-door
searches in order to track them down.
Ichiro, i don't understand
what's happened between us!
I can not stay with you any longer.
Can you try to forget about me?
- I will only bring you sadness.
- Ichiro!
Computer, computer...
take me to Monster Island.
Computer, computer...
please tell me all you know
about Monster Island.
Computer, go ahead.
What?
Oh, the antenna.
Where is Monster Island?
Computer, go ahead.
Yes? Yes?
We're going by jet?
We're taking a jet out of
Haneda Airport?
Ladies and gentleman,
thank you for riding with us on
Pan-Am Airlines.
We will arrive at Monster Island
on schedule.
Monster Island,
Monster Island this is Monster 1-5.
We are ready to make
our final approach.
It' Godzilla...
and Kamakuras!
Gorosaurus!
Manda!
Angilas!
It's Oowashi!
It's Kamakuras!
Alright!
Minya!
Come over here.
I won't do anything to hurt you.
Really?
You don't need to be afraid of me.
Thank you for helping me out.
Why did you come to
Monster Island?
I wanted to meet all of you.
Won't you father and mother
be worried?
They're never around when i
get home from school.
It's Gabara!
Gabara?
Let's go!
Is that Gabara?
It is.
He's very bad.
Do you ever fight?
I can't.
He's too strong for me.
Well, i'm the same way.
- What do you mean?
- We both have our own Gabara!
Mother!
Yes?
This is toy consultant Inami.
Is this Ichiro's mother?
Yes.
I hate to be a bother,
but would you mind looking
after Ichiro a while?
It's alright.
He just fell asleep a little while ago.
What's the matter?
I'll be home tonight,
but an associate is out sick
and i'm filling in for her.
I'm very sorry about this.
Thank you for doing it.
- It's the police.
- What's going on?
Hey, you know those crooks
who stole ¥50.000.000?
The police think could be
in this neighborhood.
Oh, my!
Hey, wake up.
Hey, it's time to wake up.
Where am i?
Where did i go? Where?
Hey, hey, you're right where you
were when you fell asleep.
Oh, no.
Why didn't you let me stay asleep?
Why would i do that?
I was just about to be introduced to
Godzilla by a very special friend.
Who?
By Minya.
Minya and i have become good friends.
Hey, hey!
Don't you go back to sleep on me!
I just got a phone call
from your mother.
She won't be able to make
it home tonight.
Really?
Again?
They always do this to me!
Relax! Relax!
Your mother and father
work hard to make ends meet.
I got it!
Why don't you eat with me tonight?
Is that okay?
Hey, you'll be okay!
Well, come over to my
place for dinner.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
Minya, come get me.
It's no use.
Oh, no.
Hey, Ichiro!
Come here!
Come here!
- Ichiro's a coward!
- What a chicken!
Is nobody in here?
I'm right!
Gabara may have taken
my other radio tube,
but he won't get hold of these.
I should have guessed Gabara
would come here.
Over there!
Headphones!
I finally found them!
Quiet!
Stupid idiot!
How could you do such a thing?!
What did i do?
When you looked down this hole,
you driver's license fell out of
your pocket and the kid has it!
Get down!
Hey, follow that kid home and
get your license back!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Don't do that, you'll break it!
It's already broken.
It's okay for now,
but if you break anything more...
i'll never be able to sell
it anytime soon.
I have my own driver's license.
Hey, hey, hey!
Why don't you take your
toy license elsewhere?
Monster Island, Monster Island.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Monster Island, go ahead.
Mister!
You're interested in this car,
right?
Well, i...
It looks old on the outside,
but is runs good.
Would you like to speak
to the owner?
Oh, this isn't you car?
Well, it's not,
but i'm in charge of it.
How about it?
Let me show it to you.
- No... maybe later!
- Hey, hey!
What a cheapskate!
- Hey, Ichiro! Dinner time!
- Right!
Hey, what's the matter?
You haven't bad any meat!
I would...
but it's not right.
What do you mean?
I don't want you to go bankrupt.
I won't go bankrupt over sukiyaki!
Did you sell your toy?
I think i did.
And for that,
i'll make you my monitor.
Monitor?
I make a new toy,
and as a child you can test
it to see if you like it or not.
Well, can i monitor the sukiyaki too?
That's right.
Let's eat!
Hey, hey!
Gobbling you food like
that is bad for you!
You won't be able to sleep!
Oh, that's right!
If you find that i'm asleep,
don't wake me.
I'll be visiting Godzilla.
Godzilla?
Where is he at?
On Monster Island.
Minya is going to introduce me to him.
We're sorry to intrude on you.
What is it?
We're with the police.
We need to ask you some questions.
The car for sale outside,
is it yours?
It is... but,
isn't alright to have it out there?
No, no...
that's not the problem.
Do you know of the criminals
that stole ¥50.000.000 recently?
They may be looking for a car, and we
wanted you to be sure to lock it securely.
Really?
Well, thank you for telling me.
Thank you.
We'll be on our way.
Let's go.
Thief! Thief!
Get away! Get away!
Thank you.
What do we do now?
I don't know how much
longer i can stay here.
I'm hungry!
Hey, it wouldn't hurt to
get some curry.
Hold it.
You held out longer last month
when we were west of here.
I sure hope you can lead us
back to where that kid lives.
I found him on the second
floor of an apartment complex.
Alright.
Hey! Don't go to sleep!
Let's go finish this.
Hey!
Minya!
Gabara!
I did it!
Hi!
What?
It's you!
What are you doing?
I don't have any friends to play with.
Well, it's the same with me.
What brought you back here?
Well... i was hoping that you
would introduce me to Godzilla.
Really?
I wonder where he is now?
You don't know where he is?
- I don't think he's very happy with me.
- Why?
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles
and start creating my own legends.
Wow, he's strict!
Oh, there he is!
Let's go!
Horray!
Horray!
Good luck! Good luck!
Go get him! Good luck!
Back up.
Back up.
Will Godzilla be alright under water?
He'll be alright.
He's very strong.
He did it!
He did it!
Godzilla is back on land.
Let's follow him.
Kumonga!
Godzilla's eve was hurt!
Alright!
Hurry!
Hurry!
Get going!
Get going!
Your breath isn't that
strong yet, huh?
Well, Godzilla's just about to use his,
and it sure is powerful!
Wow, that's great!
Look at that!
Godzilla is on the ground!
He did it! He did it! He did it!
What's the matter?
It's Gabara!
What is he doing?
Is he attacking?
Hey, let's get away!
But... Godzilla won't be very pleased
with me if i run away again!
You can't do it!
Alright!
Minya, good luck!
Good luck!
Go get him!
Minya, run away!
Run away!
Okay, let's get out of here!
It's okay now.
I was cheering you on,
but it's not enough against him.
Those are jet fighters.
The humans in them attack us
whenever they pass over the island.
Hooray!
Hooray!
No, no, no, no...
I guess humans aren't the only
ones who have to study...
That was great, Minya!
Stop squirming!
If you don't stop.
I'll use this! I'll use this!
Hey, see if it's clear.
Ichiro!
Hey, Kid!
What's the big idea stealing this?
- It's alright now, go get us a car!
- Right!
You're going to behave, okay?
Be quiet!
Stop your crying!
What kind of young man are you?
I'm a young man that's scared!
You just keep quiet!
- I'll take a bowl!
- Yes, sir!
Hello.
We meet again.
Are you still working this late?
It's been pretty hopeless so far.
Then you haven't found any
leads in the investigation?
We've gone through this area,
but the clues have been very scare.
I figured we would look
around a little longer.
Hey,
would ¥50.000.000 fill a bag?
Sure.
It would fill a bag about this big.
Damn!
What's taking him so
long to get a car?
Just ignore me. Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
Just ignore me.
- Minya. It's Minya.
- What?
You better watch out for Minya.
There's nothing to look
out for here!
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya... Minya... Minya... Minya...
Minya! Hang in there!
I know you can do it!
That's it!
Minya!
This way!
Come up here!
Minya!
Hurry up!
I have an idea!
Hurry! Hurry!
This will work! When Gabara steps on that
end of the tree, you jump on this end!
What will happen then?
It will send him flying!
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on!
Alright!
Let's do it!
Now!
You did it!
Godzilla, get him!
He did it! He did it!
He did it! He did it!
I knew Godzilla was the greatest!
Gabara's a chicken!
Gabara's a chicken!
Don't do it!
I'm on your side!
Stay back!
Somebody, help me!
- Help me! Help me! Help me!
- Hey! You're having a nightmare!
- Help me! Help me!
- Wake up! Hey! Wake up!
Keep quiet!
It's me!
It's me!
Stupid idiot!
What took you so long?!
Give me a break!
The tire was punctured!
The spare wasn't very
good, either!
- I don't think that this...
- Do you have the car?!
The car is ready for us outside.
Your hankerchief...
Your hankerchief!
Are we taking the kid?
I'm not too keen on kidnapping.
Not his legs!
His hands!
We won't kill the kid.
We'll just take him with us.
He's going to be our insurance.
Sort of like a safety net, huh?
Grab the bag and let's get going!
Right...
- Hey, i...
- Hurry up!
Sit still!
Hurry up!
Damn, not another delay!
We have to hurry up!
Hey...
you stay put, okay?
What's the matter?
Idiot!
Let me do it!
Whatever you're doing, hurry!
Godzilla feels i should fight my own battles
and start creating my own legends.
Let me go!
Let me go!
You brat!
Stop!
Keep quiet!
Damn!
He's in here.
Let's get him and head for the car.
Hey, you check those rooms
and see if he's in there.
Idiot!
Be careful, you idiot!
What do you expect me to do?
I'm not some animal that can
see in the dark!
That's enough!
Come on!
- Hey, did you find him?
- No.
Damn!
- Where could he have gone?!
- He's not here.
Hey, you go down and watch the entrance.
I'll go check the second floor again.
Damn brat!
What's the matter?
- He's on the third floor.
- Good.
Hmm...
this car looks kind of familiar.
Where have i seen it?
This is my car!
If this is my car,
why is it out here?
This is strange...
What's this?
It isn't mine.
The thieves!
Well... i looked in my car
and found a bag!
Yes, a bag!
I'm sure i didn't imagine it!
Damn!
You think you can get away?
Hey!
I found him! Hurry!
What happened?!
- Where are you?
- I... i'm here!
- But where is that?
- I'm below you!
You stupid idiot!
- Damn!
- What happened?
It's not broken.
Hey, where can i find him?
Up there!
Why didn't you tell me sooner?!
There he is!
Hold it!
Hold it, you brat!
Bastard!
Hey, stop!
Stop it!
Wait!
Here it is!
This is it.
- Uncle!
- It's Ichiro!
- Ichiro!
- Uncle! Uncle!
Get back!
Put your hands up!
- Drop the knife!
- Hurry up!
Hey!
Come here!
Put your hands in the air!
Come out here now!
- I'm sorry!
- Yeah, right!
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Those two... Ichiro,
did you catch them on your own?
Yes, i did.
It's all right...
it's all right...
You did it, huh?
Good job.
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry.
You mother had to work again last night.
I won't do it again.
But...
it's so we can live better, right?
Oh, my!
You and dad work
any time you have to.
I'll be alright.
Breakfast was good!
- See you later!
- See you later! Be careful!
Boy, you faced the thieves
on your own?
I wasn't alone.
Huh?
You weren't alone?
Who else helped you?
Hey, who helped you
through the ordeal?
It was Minya.
Minya?
- See you later!
- Hey, Kid! Boy!
It's alright!
It's Minya... the monster.
I think i understand.
I think he believes that
his ideas came from Minya.
- Believes...?
- Yes.
In a man's world,
we have our god.
In a child's world, it's not difficult
to view Minya as a divine guide.
Sachiko!
Did you tell your story to
the reporters?
I want to see it when it's done.
Hey, Ichiro.
Will you join my gang?
No!
What?!
You're no good, Gabara!
I hate you!
Why you...!
I won't be bullied!
I hate you!
Stop that!
What are you doing?!
You shouldn't play with that!
Stop that...!
He did it!
Let's go!
Stop!
Hey! Hey!
Stop!
Father!
- Father!
- Yes, son?
Dad, do a favor?
Can you hold up that man?
- Huh? What's the matter?
- I made him angry!
- Huh?
- Hey! You! Stop!
You can't get away!
- Get going!
- Thank you, dad!
Hey!
Hey!
Wait!
I'm sorry.
What appears to be the problem?
- What kind of question is that?!
- Hey, what happened?
I've got paint all over me
because of that kid!
- I didn't do a thing to him!
- I'm sure he didn't mean it.
Hey, Ichiro!
Mister, i'm sorry!
THE END
