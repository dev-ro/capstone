Is it an auspicious day?
A lot of newlyweds today.
But there aren't too many pretty brides.
- Did you see the one who took the 3:15?
- The chubby one?
She's the best we've seen so far today.
There's a storm warning out, you know.
Bad things follow the good.
Look, another bride.
Too skinny, if you ask me.
WARNING
STRONG WINDS
I don't see Mikami here.
I wonder what happened to him.
Looks like he didn't come.
I sent him an invitation, of course.
He's just not present.
What happened?
Next we'll hear from Mr. Hirayama,
executive director of Daiwa Trading...
...and a good friend of the bride's father.
Me?
Please be seated.
Tomoko, heartiest congratulations.
The previous speakers
have said many fine things.
I haven't much to add.
From what I hear, the bride and groom
have been infatuated with each other.
I've had the pleasure to hear
about her relationship...
...not that I had much of a choice.
Her stories reflected
the affection they had for each other.
Even at my age, I couldn't help
but reflect on my younger days...
...although that was such
a long time ago.
Comparatively, my own marriage
was a...
...much more pragmatic
and routine one.
My wife would agree as well.
That our marriage was not
one based on infatuation.
We just followed the path
that our parents arranged for us.
In that respect, the newlyweds are
truly fortunate to have this opportunity...
...and I can't help but envy them.
Please continue to be happy together...
...not that you really need
to work hard at that.
I hope you let us all know how much
your love grows with each passing year.
Become our role models
for years to come...
...and let us envy you even more.
Thank you, and congratulations.
Thank you.
Not at all.
Let's see, when was it?
1942 or 1943.
I visited Kure on my way home
from Yamaguchi.
Was Mikami still there?
He was there.
His shipboard duty came later.
One night, he treated me
at the Officer's Club.
There was all kinds of liquor.
Those were probably the best
of times for him.
No, they continued for
another year or two.
Have another?
Isn't it about time for Mikami's daughter
to get married?
I think she's a year younger than mine.
The one we saw today?
No, the older one.
That's what I thought.
Yours should be soon too, right?
That's true.
You're surrounded by daughters.
- Your kids are boys, right?
- Yeah, two of them.
You know how it goes.
Girls are born if the father is stronger.
And boys are born if the mother
is stronger. I wonder?
They say it's better to have
a daughter before having a son.
Perhaps the man is stronger
in the earlier stage of marriage.
That could be.
Then in your case, it's odd.
- Odd?
- Why do you have two boys?
You should ask my wife.
I'm actually not as strong as I look.
Liar!
Welcome!
Everyone's here, almost like a reunion.
Welcome, welcome.
- Haven't seen you for some time.
- It's been a while.
Congratulations, Mr. Kawai.
Good thing the weather held up.
It was fortunate that the winds
didn't pick up, as reported.
With your daughter gone,
won't you feel lonely?
No, I'm used to it. It's my second time.
- How many do you have?
- How many what?
Husbands?
I mean children.
Children? I have three.
All boys, aren't they?
That's right. How did you know?
We can tell.
- I knew it.
- That's for sure.
It wouldn't be right otherwise.
What is it?
We're saying that your body
is well suited for boys.
- Hey, can you bring us some sake?
- Sure, sure.
You're all acting a little strange.
Welcome back.
Welcome back.
Where did you-all go to?
Wakamatsu.
Mr. Kawai should've gone straight home.
His wife must have been lonely, all alone.
- Where's Setsuko?
- She's not home yet.
- Not home?
- Yes.
It's late.
It was a wonderful reception.
Tomoko looked very cute,
and also very happy.
Kimonos look better
than Western dresses.
- Have you spoken to Setsuko yet?
- Yes, I have.
What did she say?
She just silently grins
and doesn't say too much.
It's time for her to think about it.
I know, but isn't it a little early?
It's not early. He seems to be
a fine young man.
It wouldn't hurt her to make a decision.
I suppose so.
I hear he comes from a good family.
According to Mr. Takanashi...
...his grandfather was once the president
of the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce.
Oh, really?
Supposedly a prominent man.
Talking about Setsuko?
I'm not sure if you should decide.
What do you mean?
I'm sure she has her own opinion.
I do too.
Do you?
I wouldn't want to have
an arranged marriage with a stranger.
Is that so?
Of course.
That's too bad.
Don't worry, I'll find my own husband.
Really? That's encouraging.
Find a nice man for yourself, Hisako.
That won't be a problem.
There's a lot of nice boys around.
Oh, my.
- Sister?
- I'm home.
- Should I lock the door?
- Sure.
- Is it all right?
- Sure.
I'm home.
- Welcome back.
- You're a bit late.
I was out with a friend.
Did you have a date?
Don't be silly. Mother,
how did Tomoko look?
Simply beautiful.
Is that so?
Smells nice.
Sister might have one too, you know.
Have what?
A boyfriend.
Perhaps. I wonder if she does.
I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised.
If she has one, then there's
no need for me to worry.
It wouldn't matter.
You'd still be worrying.
- Well, good night.
- Same to you.
Dear, will you be wearing
your frock coat again tomorrow?
Why would I?
Isn't there a funeral?
Oh, right. A business suit should be fine,
as long as I wear a black tie.
Even the frock coat would be confused.
Wedding one day, funeral the next.
Mr. Mikami is here to see you.
- Hello there.
- Hello.
I was in the neighborhood, so I thought
I'd drop in. Are you busy?
No, it's fine.
What happened yesterday?
Why weren't you at the Kawai wedding?
I had to excuse myself.
Anything wrong?
It's just that...
Well...
What is it?
I didn't feel like going.
Why? Something happen?
I didn't want to see
such a happy wedding.
Why's that?
I was thinking of my own daughter.
We actually talked about it yesterday.
Anything happen to your daughter?
Did someone mention her?
Just that we all have daughters
that would become brides soon.
Fumiko has left home.
Why?
When did this happen?
About two months ago.
She has a boyfriend
who she's living with.
I didn't know that.
It's a problem.
I'm partly to blame, of course.
Really? So, what is she up to now?
From what I hear,
she lives near Suginami...
...and is working at a bar in Ginza.
Do you happen to know
a place called Luna?
You go to those places often.
Luna? I've never heard of it.
I can't check for myself...
...to see what she's doing.
If you have a chance,
would you stop by if you're in the area?
Sure, why not.
But I wonder what happened.
Come in.
A Mrs. Sasaki from Kyoto is here.
- Mrs. Sasaki?
- Yes.
Please excuse me.
I'll be leaving.
- You have a visitor, right?
- Don't worry about it.
I'll come again. See you soon.
Okay.
- Then I'll see you again.
- Goodbye.
- Thank you for coming.
- No, thank you.
Well, well, it's been a long time.
Quite so.
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.
When did you get here?
We arrived yesterday.
Yukiko is with me too.
It's been such a long time.
How is everyone doing?
How's Hisako?
Thanks for the bamboo shoots.
They weren't very good, were they?
I'm so embarrassed.
Matsu and I were talking about
how we could send something so terrible.
I shouldn't say this, but we have
good guests and bad guests.
We were supposed to send you
the good batch.
But we discovered that we had sent you
the bad batch somehow.
So Matsu and I were saying
how stupid we were for this mistake.
We thought of sending another batch,
but there was nothing to send.
The shoots were
already bamboo by then.
I wouldn't want bamboo.
Of course. You wouldn't
be able to eat them.
- Why have you come to Tokyo?
- Why?
- Yes.
- It's about Yukiko.
What's the matter with her?
Well, here goes.
Yukiko keeps making up stories
and won't listen to a word I say.
- What are you talking about?
- About her marriage.
Is that so? That's great news.
It's not great news yet.
I'm sure you know about the doctor
from the hospital in Tsukiji.
- I don't think so.
- Of course you do.
- He stays with us while in Kyoto.
- Is that right?
I bet he gets the good shoots.
Yes, indeed. You've never met him?
So is he the candidate?
No, no. Please listen.
The doctor is over 60 years old.
How can I send Yukiko to a man like that?
- So who's the lucky man?
- It's the doctor's apprentice.
- But he's still a doctor.
- He must be well off.
I'm not too sure about that,
but he's a very kind young man.
When he stayed over last time,
he did some treatment.
- For Yukiko?
- No, no, for myself.
Remember I have a chronic disease?
Remind me, what is your disease?
Wait, aren't you busy?
I don't have too much time, but...
Is that so? Excuse me.
I had chest pains, remember?
All of a sudden, I'd feel constricted,
and I couldn't breathe.
There are times when I feel
that I've come to an end.
So I had that doctor examine me...
...and he advised that I should
have a complete check-up.
Who knows what they'll do to me
during such a procedure.
You know the shiny drill
at the dentist's office?
I can't stand having that thing
come close to me. I'd probably faint.
So I'd get no treatment
and rush back home.
Imagine how I would deal
with a complete physical!
Hey, wait a second.
What's the matter?
I have to go to the bathroom.
Please.
- Perhaps I should leave soon.
- No, it's all right.
If you say so.
Oh, can you bring some tea
to the reception room?
- Should I wait?
- No, please go.
Excuse me.
Welcome.
I'm Yukiko Sasaki from Kyoto.
Please wait here.
- Welcome.
- Glad to see you.
Come right in.
Thank you. Is your wife here?
What about everyone else?
Since it's Sunday,
everyone went out shopping.
- Is that so?
- Anyway, come in.
The other room is probably better.
It's more inviting.
- I don't have to be too polite with you.
- Yes, I'm just a mediocre bamboo shoot.
- Use this.
- Thank you.
Ms. Tomizawa, can you bring us
some tea?
And also some snacks, please.
It isn't much, but please have it.
Thank you.
So has your mother decided on
getting a complete exam?
She finally made up her mind.
Thank you for your help.
Lots of fuss?
She was fretting from the day before.
She thought about not getting checked
and returning to Kyoto.
She doesn't listen to a word I say.
How did you persuade her?
Since she was being so unreasonable,
I told her:
"Listen to me, I am worried
about your health.
But if you're still going to be stubborn,
you won't be my mother anymore."
- Then she got sad.
- What a harsh thing to say.
Maybe, but she won't listen to me
unless I say something like that.
But Kyoto has good hospitals too.
Exactly. But it's part of
my mother's silly plot.
- Plot?
- Yes.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
It's so different out here,
even the color of the sky.
So, what about this plot?
I'm sure my mother said something
about my marriage.
She mentioned a young doctor.
She enters the hospital, wants me
to come visit her every day...
...then hopes that I would
start to like this young doctor.
It's so obvious.
So, what do you think of him?
He doesn't interest me at all.
Then I feel sorry for your mother,
to be in that hospital.
At least she can get healthy.
That's true.
And what are you going to do?
I'm going to shop a bit,
then I leave tomorrow.
- You're leaving your mother here?
- Yes.
How cruel of you.
But I need to teach her a lesson...
...or else she'll continue to find men
I have no interest in whatsoever.
Is that right?
It's one of my mother's bad habits.
Besides, I'm worried about
Matsu being alone at the inn.
Is there someone you're in love with?
No, there isn't anyone.
If that's the case...
...there's no need to marry in haste.
That's true.
Yes, it is. You may think marriage
is golden, but it can end up being brass.
Really? Brass?
Yes. Don't rush it.
Marriage isn't as great as you may think.
If all young women rushed off to get
married, the world would be a lonely place.
Romance is good from time to time.
Are there any signs
of marriage for Setsuko?
I guess you can say there are.
But someone as beautiful as you
shouldn't go to some strange man.
It'd be such a waste.
When will everyone be back?
They didn't say.
If you want, I can have Setsuko
stop by your place after work.
Please do. I'd love to see Setsuko.
Wow, it's such a lovely day.
Please take your medicine.
It's so terrible!
What medicine is this?
It's sulfur.
What is it good for?
Do I have to drink it all?
I really don't want to.
Has my daughter come?
Your daughter?
No, she hasn't been here.
What is she up to?
She should've been here by now.
She was only here for a little bit
yesterday, and that's it.
My mother should be
in a room around there.
Is that so.
- So have you met this doctor?
- Yes, briefly.
- What's he like?
- He doesn't interest me.
It's all Mother's idea.
I've had enough of it.
- What about you?
- Me?
I heard from your father
that you might get married.
Oh, that. It's nothing, really.
My father's deciding for himself.
Really?
Isn't it awful? I wish it would stop.
She's that persistent?
That's all she can talk about.
The other day, I was walking
around town with my mother.
We passed by a man in a tuxedo
with a white scarf around his neck.
Then Mother asks me
what I think of him.
So I turned around to look. He had
an ad for a cabaret on his back.
He was just a solicitor!
In that sense, I envy you, Setsuko.
Unlike my mother, both your father
and mother are very understanding.
I'm not too sure about that.
No, I'm sure. They're exact opposites.
My mother is crazy.
She goes on like a broken record, but she
doesn't know what she's talking about.
But your mother's stories
are so interesting.
Too interesting, if you ask me.
Imagine being in my shoes.
Setsuko, let's form an alliance.
What do you mean by an alliance?
I'd like you to help me out
when my mother speaks more nonsense.
And of course I will do the same.
- Sure.
- Great. I'm counting on you.
Then let's pledge our alliance.
What was that?
It's an oath. If you break it,
bad things will happen to you.
I see.
Thank you.
- Should I wait?
- You can go now.
Excuse me.
Oh, my. It's so great to see you again.
Welcome. Come on in.
May I? Are you busy?
No, don't worry. Come on in.
Thank you. Excuse me.
- Please.
- Thank you.
- Welcome.
- Thank you. Sorry to bother you.
This isn't much, but please have it.
Thank you very much.
- It's not for you, but for the family.
- Yes, I understand.
Are you busy with something?
I know how you can go on and on,
so I decided to go to the bathroom first.
Oh, okay.
Never mind. Is Hisako at school?
Yes, and Setsuko is at work.
I envy you for having two fine girls.
Yukiko left me here
and returned to Kyoto.
So I hear.
So how was the examination?
Oh, that place.
Let me tell you, it was terrible.
They sent electricity through
wires on my hands and feet.
Then blue ink was injected
right here in my arm.
Oh, and when they inject that blue ink...
...your urine turns blue too.
It was awful.
And that's not all.
I had to drink this white, muddy fluid.
There's no taste to it, either.
I was supposed to stay three more days,
but I had them release me.
So you left your treatment?
I don't need them to find out
what's wrong with my body.
I couldn't stand it.
So how is your heart?
The older doctor says that there's
nothing wrong. Just a case of neurosis.
When I told him about my pain,
he told me that it's all in my head.
He wouldn't listen to a word I had to say.
Can you believe it?
Well, at least you're healthy.
Why did I come to Tokyo just for this?
It's good that you got it
checked out, at least.
That's true.
So, what about the young doctor?
- He's the one!
- What do you mean?
He's the one who injected me
with the ink. I begged him to stop.
But he said it was to check my liver,
and used this ink on me.
I started to hate such a merciless man
very quickly.
Oh, too bad it didn't work out.
I'll just find another.
Let me know if you find someone.
Sure, if I find a nice man.
How troublesome. I'm worried about her,
but she tells me not to bother.
Yukiko doesn't understand how I feel.
Even us, we all go through
the same thing.
Really? But Yukiko is older than Setsuko.
She needs to decide soon.
Don't you worry. Yukiko is practical,
and is very beautiful.
- Really?
- Really.
I guess so.
Well, I do have a candidate in mind.
What's he like?
He's involved with medicine,
but he's not a doctor.
- What does he do?
- He's a pharmacist.
He's the second son
of a pharmacist in Osaka.
Was it four, or maybe five?
He's older than Yukiko...
...but he graduated from
Osaka University.
Maybe he's the one.
You have a lot of candidates.
Yes, he might be the right one.
So listen to me. This man...
Wait. Excuse me for a moment.
Sure.
It's over here.
Oh, yes, that's right.
Aren't you busy?
Don't go too far!
Don't worry about us!
I'm glad the weather's nice.
This is a rare family outing for us.
It sure is a great day.
Maybe I should go play.
Do you mean golf?
Please, not today.
This may be our last outing together.
If Setsuko gets married...
I see. You're right.
But we can go on another trip
before she gets married.
But you're a busy man.
So, what do you mean when you say
she silently grins?
Are you talking about Setsuko?
I was the same too, you know.
Times have changed since then.
Should we go forward
in arranging her marriage?
Sure. I don't see a problem.
It's such a wonderful day.
L...
- What is it?
- I think about it from time to time.
Remember during the war,
when the enemy planes would come...
...we would rush to the shelters?
Setsuko had just started
elementary school.
Hisako could barely walk.
The four of us huddled in the dark.
Remember how we thought if we had died
at least we'd be together?
Yes, I do remember.
I didn't like the war...
...but I reminisce about those times.
Don't you?
Not really.
I hated those times.
We had nothing.
There were a lot of
stupid people strutting around.
But I liked it.
We were together as a family then.
Is it because
I've been coming home late?
It's not that.
But it's rare now that we have dinner
as a family.
That's because
I've gotten busy at work.
But life has become easier, hasn't it?
But...
But what?
No, it's nothing.
I had a bad day yesterday. I couldn't
get over the seventh-hole bunker.
Yeah, it's tough if you get caught there.
I went out with my family to Hakone.
That would've been the safer choice.
How was it there?
I devoted the day to my family.
I think it's good for a change.
What is it?
This person wishes to see you.
I'll meet him in here. Bring him in.
Please come in.
Nice to meet you.
My name is Taniguchi.
Hello, I'm Hirayama.
Nitto Chemical?
I have a daughter working there.
Is there anything...
...I can do for you?
Well...
...I'd like to marry your daughter.
In other words?
I'd like permission
to marry your daughter.
To you?
Does Setsuko know about this?
She does.
It's customary, of course, to have
someone in between...
...and ask for your permission,
but there isn't much time.
Time?
Well, I'm being transferred...
...so I wanted to get
your consent beforehand.
Well, this is out of the blue.
I apologize, sir.
I can't give you an answer right now.
I would need to talk with Setsuko.
You should leave.
Please consider it.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Here is the estimate
from Hill Enterprises.
Leave it here.
So you knew nothing about it?
Nothing at all.
Setsuko never told me.
That's tough.
I'm home.
- What is it?
- Come here.
Sit down.
What is it?
Do you know a man named Taniguchi?
He came to see me at my office today.
Did you know that?
I didn't.
He wants to marry you.
What's your relationship with him?
I know him from work.
Have you known him long?
Do you intend on marrying him?
Answer me.
I hope to marry him.
Why have you kept silent?
Why didn't you consult us?
You should know that we were
trying to arrange something for you.
I'm not too sure about
giving my consent to him.
Can't l...?
What is it?
Can't I find my own happiness?
Setsuko.
I'll find my happiness on my own!
- Where are you going, Setsuko?
- I'm going out.
Setsuko!
Hi, come on in.
Why?
Why did you see Father
without telling me?
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought it would be better that way.
Why?
I didn't want to cause you any trouble.
What do you mean?
I told you before that I was going to
talk with Mother first, then my father.
Yes, I thought of that.
But it'll have the same result.
Why?
No matter the method...
...the answer will be either yes or no.
So I thought I'd be able to get
an answer quickly if I asked directly.
I'm sure you've heard about
my transfer to Hiroshima.
Yes, I have.
That's why I went to see him.
Then what happens if Father says no?
My mind is made up.
What about you?
Do you need to ask that?
I'll never leave you.
I'm relieved to hear you say that.
Then that's the way it will be.
Everything's all right now.
It's late. You'd better go.
I'll see you home.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- See you.
- Thanks.
I escorted her home.
Thank you.
Good night.
She's come home?
Setsuko!
- What is it?
- Sit down.
Where have you been?
What are you thinking?
Don't you think you're being imprudent?
Is it appropriate to decide on
such a thing without consulting us?
Don't you think
you're making a mistake?
Well?
Why don't you answer me?
Don't be so harsh.
I'm not talking to you.
So how about it, Setsuko?
I don't want you to have
an unhappy marriage.
I can't stand to see you make a mistake
and ruin your future.
Do you know Taniguchi well?
I do.
Is he your ideal husband?
I think so.
He's not from a distinguished family,
as you may wish from my husband.
But I don't think that fact
will make me unhappy.
I disagree.
That is your opinion.
Setsuko!
I disagree.
I have my own plans.
What kind of plans? Tell me.
Even if I did, I don't think
you'd understand.
What?
Setsuko.
Mother.
You two were fortunate
from the beginning.
We may not be able to enjoy
the kind of life Father has in mind...
...but it doesn't matter to us.
That won't make us unhappy.
We'll be responsible
for whatever we do.
We won't cause you trouble.
But, Setsuko...
It's fine now, really.
Nevertheless, Setsuko,
you may say so...
...but you're still young
and your future is bright.
Many things happen in a lifetime.
You're both in love,
and that might suffice for now.
But who knows what will happen
in the future?
You have to think of those
circumstances as well.
You say that we were fortunate
from the beginning.
It wasn't all happiness throughout
the course of this marriage.
We've had to suffer at times.
That's why your father is worrying.
Give it careful thought.
You understand, don't you?
That's enough. Leave her alone.
Anyway, I'm opposed to it.
Bad things happen
when young girls go out.
Stay home for a few days
and think it over.
I have work.
Who cares about work?
There's no need to go.
You should go to bed now.
She's difficult.
But...
...I think you might like him, Taniguchi.
When did you meet him?
He escorted Setsuko home.
You barely got a glance at him.
How would you know?
Don't be so naive.
Anyhow, I'm against
Setsuko marrying him.
You called?
Come in.
Are you busy?
- No.
- So you have time?
Yes. Well, no.
Of course you don't have
much free time.
I have something to ask you.
Sure. What is it?
Taniguchi, the guy who was here
yesterday, do you know him well?
Yes, we went to the same school.
He's two years older than me,
and he played basketball at school.
Is that so. Anything else? Is that all?
We worked together one summer.
You did? Where was this?
At a warehouse in Hakka's.
He also rides motorcycles.
Mr. Miami is here to see you.
Show him in.
I'll have to talk to you later.
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you again.
I don't want to be a nuisance...
...but how did it go?
Were you able to go to Luna?
I've been quite busy lately,
so I haven't gone yet.
Well, I'm not in a hurry...
...but I'm just worried.
I'll go tonight.
Really?
Thank you.
We both have problems
with our children.
Maybe we pampered them too much.
How ironic.
Ironic indeed.
Welcome.
Haven't seen you in a while, Mr. Condo.
How are you?
Is this all right for you?
Welcome.
What will you have?
I'll have a highball.
What about you, Mr. Condo?
The same?
Make it two.
You've been here before?
- Well, yes.
- They all seem to know you.
You should have said so.
Then we didn't have to
look around so long.
I apologize.
I didn't think we were coming here.
Where did you think we were going?
Did you think there was a different bar
by the name of Luna?
Of course. I'm sorry.
Hey, does a Umeko work here?
Last name is Miami.
You must mean Karo.
She's out, but will be back soon.
Here you are.
Here, Mr. Condo.
Why are you so quiet tonight?
- Drink up.
- Thank you.
So, what's this Taniguchi like?
He's two years older,
and played basketball.
You told me that.
He was a forward. He's good at
driving the lane.
I mean as a person. How is he?
- His character.
- He's a good man.
What do you mean?
It's hard to say, but he's very nice.
What was it like working with him?
We worked in different sections.
- So you don't know him very well, then.
- I guess not.
Why didn't you say so?
I'm sorry.
There she is. Karo's back.
What is it?
You're Umeko?
Remember me?
I'm Hiram, your father's friend.
Anyway, sit down.
You've changed a lot.
I haven't seen you in a while.
- That's true.
- How have you been?
Did you hear from Father
that I was working here?
I wanted to check up on you.
I don't need any advice.
I want to be left alone.
It's nothing like that.
How about it? I would like
to talk to you in private.
What about?
It's nothing to worry about.
Do you know of anyplace?
I can't leave right now.
That's fine. It can be after
you've finished here.
What do you say?
Mr. Condo, you're awfully quiet.
What is it? What's the matter?
What is it?
Don't act so familiar.
He's my boss.
A chance for you to drink.
Hardly.
Another one?
No more tonight.
Don't stay here.
Go away.
You're such a chicken.
What did you say? Watch your mouth.
I'll get even with you.
- Welcome!
- Welcome!
Give me some dumplings.
Thank you.
So you two get off work
around this time?
Yes, he'll be coming here soon.
We always go home together.
So you said he plays music
at a cabaret?
Yes, he plays the piano.
He specializes in music theory.
So, what do you think of your father?
My father?
I do feel sorry for him.
But he's so stubborn.
Stubborn?
He doesn't understand.
Not at all.
Not at all?
He doesn't even try to understand.
He thinks he's always right.
You think so?
I wonder.
It's true.
Father has to have
everything his own way.
You exaggerate.
It's true.
It's because he worries about you.
He doesn't have to worry.
Things don't work that way.
What about you? Are you happy?
Me?
Yes, I am.
I don't think I'm unfortunate at all.
There he is.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Magnum.
It's getting late, so we better get going.
I guess it is.
Excuse us.
Just a moment.
Here's some spending money.
I can't accept that.
It isn't much.
No, really. Excuse me.
Welcome home.
Where were you?
Saw Miami's daughter.
Oh, Fumiko. How was she?
She seems to be doing fine.
But it can be hard.
Did Setsuko stay at home today?
Yes, but what are we
going to do about her?
Leave her alone for a while.
She might change her mind.
Are you still awake?
I couldn't get to sleep.
Setsuko.
Surely you...
What is it?
Surely you haven't slept with that fellow?
Father.
You should know me better than that.
He isn't that kind of a man.
Let her think it over.
Tell her not to go to work.
She can even quit.
Watch her closely, and don't let her out.
I won't permit such loose conduct.
Nor a wedding.
Do you understand?
Nightgown.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Mr. Kondo, you were so quiet
the other day.
You don't know how awkward it was.
You were sweating.
This place needs air conditioning.
- So, what are you having?
- Highball, with water.
Same brand as before?
No way I'm drinking that expensive stuff.
The usual, normal, domestic,
cheap brand is fine.
Drink the expensive kind with your boss.
Nonsense. He won't come here again.
Thank God.
Hey, Kaoru.
Your father, Mr. Mikami,
how does he know my boss?
They're friends from middle school.
What does he do?
- He's in the printing industry.
- He came to see my boss yesterday.
Did they say anything?
They were just chatting.
I wasn't in the room long.
Here you are.
This tastes good!
It tastes better when I pay,
regardless of how cheap it is.
Hey, where are the peanuts?
You seem to be in a good mood.
Of course. The other night
was just an exception.
Where's my peanuts? Don't be stingy.
Keep acting like that
and your boss might come.
Don't be foolish. He won't come.
He has no business
in a dump like this.
Peanuts!
Thank you for the other day.
Welcome.
Hey. I didn't know you were here.
You seem like a regular.
Your father came by yesterday.
He didn't know the address
of your apartment or the bar...
...so he asked me to give you this.
He wants to see you.
You should see him.
It wouldn't do any good.
Anyway, give it some thought.
Goodbye.
You can sit down now.
Why did you have to say such a thing?
Now this doesn't taste as good.
Lend me a match.
- Did you go to Luna?
- Yeah, last night.
You better be careful.
The boss goes sometimes.
You saw him there?
Hello.
Miss Sasaki?
I'll talk to her.
Oh, Yukiko. You're in Tokyo again?
When did you arrive?
You want my advice?
What's this all about?
I'll drop in on the way home.
The usual place, right?
See you later.
You have a visitor.
Thank you for coming.
What's happened?
How's your mother?
It's about her.
What's wrong?
I can't stand it any longer.
What's the matter?
Did you have an argument?
Tell me about it.
She's too unreasonable.
That's why I came here.
What do you mean?
I've left home.
Without telling your mother?
You shouldn't have.
What did you quarrel about?
Mother won't listen to me at all.
What about?
I'll tell you everything.
Sure, go ahead.
As a matter of fact...
...I've fallen in love.
I see. And?
- Mother doesn't like it.
- Why?
My mother wants everything her way.
But this time, I couldn't give in.
I've made a promise
to this person already.
What's this person like?
I've known this person
for quite some time now.
My mother has decided that I should get
married to the pharmacist from Osaka.
They've been in business for a long time,
so they're wealthy, as she says.
So she makes the decision
and takes everything on herself.
She insists there's a fortune
to be made in Osaka.
Stop laughing and listen to me.
She tells Matsu to buy a lot
of fried bean curd...
...then tells me to take it
to the shrine for good luck.
What nonsense.
So did you go?
Why should I? It's so ridiculous.
Then what happened?
Mother was furious with me.
She said I was crazy for refusing
such a good man.
She also said that I wouldn't be
so lucky again.
She was terribly angry.
That's why I left home.
That's a lot of bean curd for the inn.
She must be eating it with Matsu.
And I bet the customers
are eating it too.
That's probably true. How funny.
What do you think?
Do I have to listen to what she tells me?
- Not in this case.
- I shouldn't, should I?
- My whole future is at stake.
- Exactly.
In that case, I will marry the man I love.
But is he a good man?
Then it should be fine, as long
as you can be responsible.
Of course.
Then do as you wish.
You don't have to listen to her.
You think so?
I'm so happy to hear that.
I didn't think you'd get confused
over such a thing.
I wasn't confused.
Well, I'm going to make a phone call.
To whom?
I'm calling your house to tell Setsuko.
What's this?
Sir.
I wasn't talking about myself.
It was a trick.
A ruse?
I was just acting.
I'm going to tell Setsuko
that you approve of her marriage.
Hold on!
Wait!
You're back. I didn't hear the door open.
I'm happy. I'm truly happy.
I wouldn't have known what to do
if Setsuko had run away...
...like Mr. Mikami's daughter.
I'm so happy.
You're a good father. Thank you.
For what?
Setsuko's happy too.
It's about time that you approved.
Approved what?
Her marriage with Taniguchi.
I haven't approved yet.
But Yukiko called and told us.
She did that on her own.
There's nothing I can do to stop it.
But it's good that you
at least think that way.
What do you mean?
About Setsuko.
I won't take the responsibility.
That's fine. She and Taniguchi will.
You heard her say so.
- How can I trust them?
- But...
But what? Do you know him well?
Since when are you on their side?
It's not about taking sides.
Yes, it is.
You only saw him once.
How do you know what kind of man he is?
It wasn't just once.
He came after that as well.
What? Why didn't you tell me?
You were in a bad mood
and said not to have Setsuko meet him.
You've only met him a few times.
You don't know him.
What about Takanashi?
You'll have to decline politely.
No, thanks. I'm not doing it.
If you agree with the marriage,
then you go decline.
I'm not involved in this.
Then I shall decline.
Go ahead. I'll have no part in this.
I'm not amused.
I won't attend the wedding, either.
You must at least attend the wedding.
I won't. I refuse to do so.
Then I won't attend either.
You can attend. You approve of it.
I will not attend.
Then do as you like.
I'm sure the two of them will be fine.
Fine in what way?
How should I know?
That's pretty irresponsible for someone
who approves of the marriage.
What you have to say
is always irresponsible.
Do you only think of today
and not the future?
That's not how it works.
- What about you?
- What about me? What do you mean?
No, never mind.
- Say it.
- It's fine.
If you have something to say, say it.
Everything has to be your way.
What do you mean?
It's true. It's always the case.
Even with Setsuko,
you're being inconsistent.
Inconsistent?
You told Hisako that you wouldn't worry
if Setsuko had a boyfriend.
Now that she has a boyfriend,
you disapprove of it.
Don't you think that's absurd?
No, I don't.
That's what every parent wishes for.
And you call that inconsistent?
I certainly do.
If you do love her, you wouldn't say
that you won't take the responsibility.
That's what I call absurd.
Then everyone's inconsistent.
Everyone but God.
Life is absurd. We're not all perfect.
As a scholar said,
"The sum total of inconsistencies is life."
You're always inconsistent.
I'm home.
Where's Setsuko?
Did Setsuko go out?
Where?
Taniguchi is leaving for Hiroshima
tomorrow, so she went to help pack.
How do you know that?
We thought you approved,
so Setsuko called him.
Why did you do that?
I told you not to let her out.
That's why I had Hisako go with her.
- And now I'm home.
- Why?
I felt like I was intruding.
But it's not like they're being mushy.
Everything they do is so natural
and filled with love for each other.
Mr. Taniguchi is such a nice man.
He's almost like a big brother to me.
Those two will make out fine, Father.
Don't worry. You'll see.
His train leaves tomorrow at 6:30.
I'll go see him off too.
Stop that!
Turn it off!
Hey.
Hey there.
- When did you get here?
- Just now.
I waited here, knowing that
you were playing.
So you've been here since yesterday?
How's the game?
Not so good.
Your wife came by last night.
Your daughter's getting married, eh?
Congratulations.
My wife visited you?
She asked me to act as a go-between.
For whom?
At your daughter's wedding, of course.
Is that right?
I hear you disapprove.
You can say that.
I also hear you're not attending
the wedding or the reception.
If you don't feel like it, you shouldn't go.
I'll handle it.
To send off your daughter
that you raised, that's not easy.
It's not just about that.
I heard about that too,
but it has to be done.
I'm going to proceed, okay?
I'll handle it somehow.
But I won't attend.
You don't have to.
Don't force yourself to attend.
I'll go ahead with it.
It's all settled, then.
By the way, we're planning
an alumni reunion. How about it?
A reunion with people
from our middle school.
The graduates from the West will come.
We're thinking of having it
at Gamagori. What do you say?
It's still too early for it,
but will you attend?
Shall I?
Why not? It's been a while.
I'll head to the tee now.
Do you want to come along?
I'm going to rest. I'm a bit tired.
All right, then.
Bring me a beer.
Hello?
Futaba Beauty Parlor?
This is the Hirayama residence.
I called earlier.
Hirayama.
Yes, that's right.
Can you come
one hour earlier tomorrow?
The wedding starts at 2.
Two o'clock sharp.
Is that okay?
We're depending on you.
I phoned the beauty parlor.
They'll be here.
Thank you.
Have some of the festive rice.
Thank you.
Father's late.
- Do you know why?
- He has things to take care of.
But I told him to come home early today.
It's the eve of Setsuko's wedding.
He's been acting weird lately.
It's all right, Hisako.
I think he should have dinner with us all,
especially on a day like this.
Your father's worried too,
although it may not seem like he is.
He's had an investigator
secretly check up on Taniguchi.
I saw the report.
Not eating that?
Can I have it?
I haven't been able
to do very much for you.
If you need anything, let me know.
Then I can send it to you.
I already have enough, Mother.
We won't be able to store
the things you'd send.
We'll be living in a very small place.
It sounds so nice.
"Be it ever so humble,
there's no place like home."
You probably have lots to do.
You can go upstairs now.
That Hakone outing was the last.
I had hoped that we could go
to more places together.
We could have,
if Father had been willing to.
Hisako.
But you'll be fine, Setsuko.
Mr. Taniguchi can take you places now.
Isn't scenic Miyajima
close to Hiroshima?
I don't know.
I'd like to go too.
- You can visit us during the summer.
- Can I? I mean it, you know.
Then it's a promise.
Setsuko, you'd better go now.
Mother, Setsuko was crying last night.
I happened to wake up
in the middle of the night...
...and I noticed her crying.
I asked her what was wrong,
but she just turned away.
It's not right for Father
to dislike such a nice man.
There aren't many men
as nice as Mr. Taniguchi.
Father's too old fashioned.
Welcome back.
Welcome home.
We've already finished supper.
What's this?
Does this mean that
you'll attend the wedding?
How can I not go?
Our friends are coming.
Setsuko.
Father will be there tomorrow.
He'll attend your wedding.
I'm so happy! I really am.
I knew he'd be there.
Everything's going to be all right now.
There's no need to cry.
You'll be busy tomorrow.
You better go to bed.
I'm so happy!
- Mother.
- What is it?
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry for having caused you
so much trouble.
Don't worry about it.
All I want is for you to be happy.
Now, get your things ready.
Hisako, go help your sister.
Setsuko's terribly happy.
You have to attend her wedding.
Will you eat some festive rice?
Will you?
You're certainly happy-go-lucky.
What do you mean?
I never thought that she'd defy me.
Defy?
Somehow I fail to be convinced.
It doesn't seem right.
She made this important decision
without letting her parents know.
It's definitely upsetting.
We were worrying about it too.
The mahjong table is ready
in the next room.
Oh, excellent. Shall we?
Bring beer to the next room.
I'll go try my luck.
Let's go.
So his wife asked me to act
as a go-between.
But Hirayama doesn't seem
to like the groom.
Why's that?
It's hard to find a good man...
...especially when you think that
you're giving away your precious daughter.
How many children do you have, Sugai?
None at all?
Sugai has plenty. Wasn't it six?
Seven?
All girls, I presume?
- Thought as much.
- Undoubtedly.
What do you mean?
It's nothing. Just a theory.
You keep on thinking
they're your children...
...and all of a sudden,
they're all grown up.
That's right.
That's the way it should be.
- Mikami, recite something for us.
- What?
You know, the Masatsura
you did in Kure.
- That one won't do.
- What is it?
- Something from a poet.
- I'd like to hear it.
Go ahead.
Don't be shy.
Then I guess I should.
But it doesn't quite fit this age.
This is based on a farewell poem...
...by the patriot Masatsura Kusunoki.
The precepts of my father
Remain deep in memory
The edict of the emperor
I'll follow faithfully
It'll take a while, so you can
drink up while you listen.
Ten years of patience
Now the great day is here
Strike a mighty blow
Fill the foe with fear
For the emperor's cause
We fight once again
Vowing that we will battle
And die as men
Our band of 143 warriors
We're united as one
Determined are we to fight
Until we have won
By dying, heroes gain eternal fame
Cowards suffer everlasting shame
With arrowheads we'll write our history
With sword blades we'll carve our destiny
Look to the north
Outnumbering us is the foe
Search out the general
Deal him a deathblow
That's about enough.
Isn't there more?
- If there is, continue it.
- Go on.
That's enough. I'll mess it up
if I continue on.
- Let's hear more.
- No, that's it.
It's inspiring to hear.
I agree with you.
At Sakurai, the trees are in the leaf
Twilight is a time of sorrow and grief
The warrior ponders
What is the world coming to
Glistening on his armor
Teardrops or the dew
So did you get to see Fumiko?
She comes to the house now and then.
As long as she's okay, I'm not worried.
It's difficult, isn't it?
Raising children, that is.
Eventually, parents have to give in.
Things never go smoothly.
I guess not.
We're getting old.
To think that we're talking about
our children at a reunion.
"But ever with us
are the dreams of our youth."
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.
Mr. Hirayama of Tokyo is here.
- Really? Where is he?
- In the inner room.
- Hello.
- You're back.
Welcome.
Thank you for attending
Setsuko's wedding.
Not at all.
Congratulations on the happy event.
What brings you to Kyoto?
I was in Gamagori for a reunion,
so I came down to Osaka.
Oh, I see. Have you completed
your business?
Yukiko, we were just talking about it...
...but what was it that
the two of them liked?
- What is it?
- They kept saying it was delicious.
- Oh, the pickled fish.
- That's right.
They liked it very much.
They were talking about how delicious
it was when they came by the inn.
They seemed really happy together.
They stayed in this room.
Thanks for being kind to them.
It wasn't much.
They only stayed a night.
I told them to stay longer.
He had work to do,
so they just did some sightseeing...
...and left that night.
He's such a nice man.
I hope Yukiko can find
someone like that.
How true. If I could find a man
as nice as him, I'd marry him right away.
How can you not like him?
I have nothing against him.
- Excuse me.
- Did you need me?
Please drink up.
I'm sorry for what I did the other day.
- What?
- Don't be mad at me.
Please forgive me.
About the trick?
Don't you think
I'd make a good actress?
It was cleverly done.
I was completely fooled.
- Was it a complete fabrication?
- Meaning what?
You really haven't found
a man that you love?
I wish it wasn't true,
but I haven't found anyone.
Why is that?
I don't have the time.
Your mother mentioned this earlier...
...but she's really worried about
your marriage.
She's always saying that.
- That can't be true.
- It's true.
Although she likes to say it...
...she actually doesn't want
to see me go.
I can't believe that.
It's true.
She picks various candidates,
then breaks it off.
She's like a child with building blocks.
She's having fun with it.
Really? Do you really think so?
Yes, it makes it hard for me.
But it's time for you to really consider.
How can I leave such a mother behind?
I would be worried sick.
If I leave, she'll be quarreling
with Matsu all day.
The inn will be a mess.
Matsu has been real patient with us.
If you're that worried, why don't you have
someone marry into your family?
That person wouldn't be
as patient as Matsu.
Don't worry too much about your mother.
A parent should give way to the child.
As long as the child is happy,
everything should be fine.
- Do you think so?
- Of course.
Don't worry about your mother.
Just get married.
She'll do just fine, even without you.
- That's very strange.
- Why?
- You once told me not to get married.
- Did I say that?
Something about gold and brass.
I remember now.
But it's up to you
to turn that brass into gold.
That's how a married couple should be.
So get married.
It's about time you did.
Your stories are constantly changing.
You're confusing me.
Should I or should I not get married?
It's better that you do.
This isn't a trick, is it?
I can't act as well as you.
Think it over.
Marry if you find a good man.
Be happy and your mother will be too.
Let me think.
Think it over carefully.
Busy, busy, busy!
A customer?
I wish it were. It was the tax office.
Yukiko, can you go there for me?
Not the man that usually comes by.
He's innocent, clean-looking,
nice tie, and cute.
He said to bring
our seal sometime soon.
Perhaps he'd be
a good candidate for Yukiko.
- Really? You never know.
- Mother, that's enough.
Do you know what Setsuko told me?
What did she say?
You looked displeased at her wedding...
...and never smiled once.
- That disturbed her most.
- Did she say that to you?
Really. I feel so sorry for Setsuko.
You should've at least smiled.
All you had to do was grin.
Why not from now on?
What do you mean?
What do you think, Yukiko?
He should go to Hiroshima now.
That's a great idea.
That's the best thing
you've said in a while.
You should go there at once.
To Hiroshima?
- That way, she won't worry anymore.
- Good! It's decided, then.
I can't. I have work.
This is more urgent than work.
Yukiko, call his wife.
Before he changes his mind.
Good idea!
Wait!
- You're full of good ideas.
- My brain is working for a change.
Hey, Yukiko!
Bring him to the phone.
Get me Tokyo 45-3136.
This is Gion 2784.
Hello?
Mrs. Hirayama?
How are you?
This is Yukiko in Kyoto.
Mr. Hirayama is leaving for Hiroshima.
To Setsuko's place.
Yes, he'll tell you all about it.
Here, take the phone.
Hurry. It's your wife.
Hello.
It's me.
Yes, that's right.
I guess I'm going.
Really? You'd go to Hiroshima?
I'm glad.
I'm sure Setsuko will be happy.
I haven't decided yet.
I don't really see a need for me to go.
Besides, it's troublesome.
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny?
What?
Let me tell you something.
Don't worry. I know what
you're going to say.
Regardless, please go.
Don't worry about that.
I'm glad to hear that.
You'll make Setsuko happy.
I'm relieved too.
I'm not going just to make you happy.
You see...
I know all about that too.
I'm so happy.
Send her my regards.
Have a safe trip.
Hey.
- I want to send a wire.
- Sure.
Arriving Hiroshima 2:18 p.m., Father.
Got it?
I'll send it from Osaka.
Please.
