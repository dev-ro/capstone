East, uh, Philly store.
All right, come on.
...requested for
next year's program.
The spokesman went on to say that
aspects of last year's program...
are still under
investigation.
And on the subject
of funding,
we now go to our reporter
Inez Pedroza in the field...
where she has this rather shocking story
about a children's home about to close.
The Claremont Children's Home
on South Street...
was closed today after 38 years
of continuous operation...
because of drastic budgetary cuts
in the city's welfare department.
Now, so far all of the
children have been relocated,
with the exception of eight in the
home's special education unit.
Watch howl handle this.
Hey, blood, what's happenin'?
My man!
Outta sight. Good to see you, man.
How's it goin', man?
Lookin' good. Good. Hey,
East Philly store, huh?
Yep. Check it out.
75 Hitachis?
Man, that's more than we did all last
quarter. We're kickin' ass, man.
I'll bet you are. Want
me to run that through?
Uh, no, I'll handle my main man right here.
Thank you, I appreciate that.
Everybody wants something
Japanese nowadays, man.
Cars, radios, they're even
eatin' Japanese food.
You know, raw fish, shit like that.
Tastes worse than chitlins.
Uh, this number doesn't compute.
Doesn't compute?
- [Bangs On Monitor] Try it now.
- I Typing]
- Now itsjammed. Jammed? Damn. It's
gonna take them a week to fix this.
I mean, a black man can't stand a week off.
You know what I mean?
You gotta help me out. I
don't wanna hold you up.
Luke, give him
whatever he needs.
Whool You 're all right, brother.
I mean that You got soul.
Outta sight.
All right, soul man.
Here, have a cigar.
Thanks, man.
- Nice man. I'd like to introduce you
to my sister. - Love to meet her.
- You disco?
- You kiddin'?
Get down! All right.
She'd love that. Later.
What kind of problems
are we talking about?
The children in the special
unit have very unique problems.
There's blindness, lameness,
pyromania,
learning disabilities.
One of them--
One of them was even forced
into prostitution in Vietnam...
at the age of nine.
Fifteen minutes! Big tip! All

Know your job!
You got to know your job!

[Exhales]
Now this bimbo wants the? Oor demo

Give him whatever the East Philly
store needs. Just mark it down.
- At least check the registration to that
truck out there. - Truck registration?
Wait a minute! Do I have to take this
kind of abuse, man, because I'm black?
'Cause I bet you don't torture the
white people that come in here!
Hey! I'll bet he don't torture the white
people that come in here. Do you? No!
We don't see te/e vision anymore!
O-O-Okay, just calm down.

[Door Buzzer]
Hey, ifit isn't
Miss TV Personality of 1981.
Bad choice.
Come on, let's go. I'm not going with you
this evening; I'm staying with the children.
Vivian, don't you think you're carrying
this thing just a little too far?
What are you gonna do
with eight kids?
Well, I am planning to
take them to my aunt's farm...
just outside of Seattle for
starters; that'll give them a home.
Do you really thinkyou're going to get
permission to take these kids out of state?
Come on, Donald, nobody cares about those
children. They won't even know they're gone.
Besides, uh, I--
I already have permission.
Why don't you give this up? I thought you would
be willing to help me with these children.
How am I gonna help you get eight
children 3,000 miles across the country?
No.
Charter a jet?
But you can get me a driver to drive
that old bus we have in the back.
Th-That wreck?
Well, yeah.
Vivian, get serious.
Sweetheart. Oh, Donald.
I've never been more serious
in my life.
I need your support more than ever before,
darling. Please, you've got to help me.
Mr. Braxton,
in my 30 years on the bench,
I have never seen a criminal record
equal in intensity, length...
and downright antisocial
uselessness as your own.
The sale of counterfeit
bus passes at the age of five;
conspiracy to impersonate
a truant officer;
Oh, thatihar-
a dishonorable discharge...
from the Army motor pool;
'profitee? Ng on Christmas
Seals-- Can I see that?
Defrauding
a chicken franchise?
Oh, I can explain that--
Braxton,
you have already spent three years
in a home forjuvenile offenders,
six years in state prison,
and four years on probation under the
guidance of that... gentleman over there.
Now, before f pass sentence,
do you have anything
to say for yourself?
Uh-- [Clears Throat] [
Feedback, Thumping]
-;; [Whistles]
- It's on, it's on!
Your Honor, I'd like
to make a confession.
- I did it on purpose! I wanted to
go back to prison. - You-- You what?
I mean,
doesn't it make sense?
Anybody that'd hold up a store in
broad daylight, stay 45 minutes,
- must wanna go back to prison. - Braxton,
you are talking about five to ten years.
I know that, Your Honor, but I
want you to give me 20 years!
I gotta have 20 years! I cant go
back on parole, not with that man!
The man's a racist!
He's an animal, Your Honor.
I mean, he looks black, right, but he ain't
black. He's as white as you are! No offense.
I'm telling you, he treats
black people like dog poo!
Yeah! Fouryears I've been
on parole in his hell!
It's worse than being in the Ku
Klux Klan, being under that man!
Your Honor, you gotta help me!
You can't allow me--
The prisoner will come to order!
Please send me back to prison!
Three meals a day! And let me sleep
and rest and get my hair done!
Let go of me! What do
you mean, let go?
Ten years probation! Case closed!
No! Not probation!
Oh, no! [Whimpering] Get that
man out of my courtroom!
- I'll get you for this, you dirty rat!
- Get him out of my courtroom!
I'll get you for this!
[Sobbing]
Please!
Viva America! [Judge]
Get that man!
God bless the queen!
Get hr? Out!
No--
Whew! Great show, Braxton.
[Grunts, Panting] One
hell of a performance.
Well, you know,
Yeah.
Us actors must do what we do.
Yeah.
You can pull that stuff
on Runzuli,
but it don't go down
too well with me.
So, I will see to it that
you do that five-to-ten...
unless you do a little acting for me.
What are you talkin' about?
You understand?
Yeah, yeah. What--
Okay, now, you listen carefully and I'll explain
to you exactly the role you're going to play.
[Laughing]
Well,
is it gonna make it?
[Jog Groaning] 0h, G00'!
Well, joe, how's it look?
It's a piece of shit!
[Laughing]
Everything's rotted away, man; it ain't
gonna make it out of the garage.
Unless you know somebody from
Mario Andretti's pit crew.
We can get it
to thejunkyard.
We have until Friday.
[Chuckles]
Didn't you hear what I said? Yes, I heard,
but everything has been arranged for Friday.
I have money set aside in case you need
anything, and I'll give you my business--
Something wrong, Mr. Braxton?
No. I thought you said--
Hey!
Uh-- Yeah.
Uh, sweetheart, th-this
man is an expert.
Now, if he says it's not possible,
it's just not possible.
Donald, I thought you were going to get
me someone to drive us to Washington.
I 00k, sweetheart-- Don't tell me whats
possible and whats not possible.
Vivian, just-- Get your
expert to fix the bus!
Vivian, let me explain to you what?
Going on! I'm serious, Donald.
He) 4 /00/ <, f got a job x}? tervfew
to go to,I am serious, Donald!
And I know this is personal-- Y'all look
real nice together-- but I gotta split.
- Hey, Braxton, you trying to make me
look bad? - I ain't tryin' to do nothin'.
I told you to tell her-- You told
me to tell her the bus don't work!
Donald!
What's going on here?
Askyour old man.
You know something, Braxton?
Uh-uh.
I'm gonna burn your butt.
You are?
You're gonna burn that checkup on me, 'cause I
ain't going back to the joint for you or nobody.
I took care of that, man. You
take care of your business.
I'll see you Friday.
Fix your hanky there.
Miss Lady, nice meeting you.
Braxton. Braxton!
Donald! Let me just try to
explain to you what's going on.
Oh, never mind! Look, I'm
trying my best to help you!
This scheme is impossible! It's not
gonna work! There's just no way!
[Typewriters Clacking]
Hey, man, I wanna
talk to you later.
Hold it, joe. You know darn well you
don't have an appointment for today.
Who needs an appointment?
Goddamn! Whoo!
I'm not going through that. Go

You disrupted the place last time; you're

Baby, you do it! Jump back!

Hey, look,

But you can't ask me to fix a bus and go
to Washington with a bunch of funky kids!
Look, let's
turn it aroundJoe.
Let's look at it from the other direction;
now, what would you do in my position?
If I was in your position, man, I'd
give me a break! Give you a break.
[Chuckling]
Yeah.
Tell you what I'm gonna do-- As a matter of
fact, I'll tell you what you're gonna do.

You got that? - All the way. I got it, man.

happened to me. Ohh, boy. - Ooooh!
I cried like a baby. I'll tell you
one thing, my mother surprised me.
Instead of a beating, she ga

Go take a hike!
Shut up!

The woman put her ass

'bout yourselves!
We're not losers!

Dare to be rich.
[Snickers]
The Trapezoid Approach...
To Personal
Economic Security."
This sounds very familiar.
I know this.
[Crowd Laughing, Applauding]
In what way does your trapezoid
differ from the pyramid schemes...
that we've been reading about in the
papers? I'm glad you've asked that.
I'll bet you are.
Now, the pyramid is based on the
triangle, which has three sides.
But the trapezoid
has four sides!
And it is that fourth side
which guarantees,
geometrically and mathematically,
the enrichment...
of all those
who participate in it.
- [Crowd Murmuring]
- Does that answer your question, sir?
Yeah, thank you.
Now...
are there
any other questions?
I have a gentleman
in the back row.
Uh, Mr. Professor Renfrew?
Sir.
My name is Millard Gregg,
and I'm from Texarkana.
I have a few questions about
that tra-- tripi-- trapezoid?
Now, you say if I give you
a thousand dollars,
by this afternoon
my money will double?
Maybe even triple? Triple?
[Chuckling]
Oh, my God, sir. Why, some people-- Mr.
Munjak here--
have seen their bank
accounts grow twenty-fold...
in under a week through
the trapezoidal method!
Twentyic?d? Yes, let's
hear it for the gentleman!
[App/aud/ng]
And he don't pay no taxes?
- That is right! - Hot damn!
I don't wanna miss this!
Now, I'm gonna give you
my thousand dollars...
'cause you're at the top of the trapezoid.
That's right.
And then I'll sell my share
to two other people,
and they give you half,
and give me half.
That's right. And then this
thing doubles and then splits.
And then you get money from that side and
that side and that side. That's right!
My God. My wife and I this
morning said a prayer... to God.
I was hopin' somethin' like
this-- I just can't believe it.
I really can't. I mean,
this is on the up-and-up?
That's right. Then you won't
mind if I collect the money?
I'm one of these people.
You people don't mind, do you?
Uh, Dwayne, would you let the
gentleman take your chair...
momentarily? [Joe] Well,
thank you, Dwayne.
Don't mention it, brother.
You know, my God, look at this!
Thousand-dollar bills!
You know, you can live a lifetime and
never see a thousand-dollar bill.
I haven't seen one of them
since-- Well, hell.
Mmm, my, my.
Look at that.
Ain't that nice!
This is gonna be real fun here.
I can tell we gonna have a real good
time, all the way, me and you, huh?
You wanna get started?
Samantha, pass me a piece of corn.
Ernesto, you want this?
[Boy] Come on, pass me the com
bread Can I have some greens?
[Si g h s] [Girl]
Pass me some greens.
Aunt Beedee, I'd like to borrow
the truck for a little bit.
I want to run into town and see if
I can find out what's goin' on.
[Indistinct Shouting]
[Shouting Continues]
Thank you. Thank you.
Dare to be rich, sir.
- Dare to be rich, sir. - Everybody's
doin' what they gotta do.
Yes, sir.
Yes! Dare to be rich!
Now, who next
will dare to be--
The gentleman
in the cowboy hat!
Yes, you, sir.
Uh, Mr. Munjak!
Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
[Mumbling] Yes, indeed.
Everybody dare to be rich.
Assist our new associate.
[Joe] Dare to be rich.
- You bet. - Everybody's supposed to
dare to be rich one time in life.
You get two people,
and they get two people...
and you split up like that
and just dare to be rich!
Having fun, turkey? Oh, yeah.
Lam, I am.
Dare to be rich! You better dare to
haul ass when we get you outside.
[Renfie w] And now, who's next?
Who will dare to be rich?
Martin, isn't that the car
we saw at the bank?
[Harold] What car?
The Rolls -Royce.
Yeah, let's trash it!
No, let's steal it.
Wait!
I've got a better idea. What?
[Renfie w] As you know, we will
not be returning to this area...
forat least three weeks. 50, laziies
and gentlemen, while Miss Peas/ey...
pins these two remaining names, I would ask
those of you who ha ve not yet joined us...
in the trapezoid, to consider seriously
the thought of coming along with us.
[Joe] That's right, 'cause the
professor would never lie to you!
'Cause easy come, easygo. Round
and round she goes. Joe!
Where she stops, nobody knows. I'm telling
you, Missjohnson, you did a wonderful thing!
She's in the trapezoid!
Let's hear it for Missjohnson!
Yes, sir. Why don't you
take care of that, Dwayne?
And look it here! Here's another lady
who wants to join the trapezoid!
What are you doing? There she
is, ladies and gentlemen!
You got a thousand dollars?
How many shares you want?
What? Now, don't ask me. I sold
the bus and bought this outfit,
and I'm trying to make us money.
Yes, ma'am, $300!
You sold the bus? Here's $15,000
for the kids. Take it home!
Don't worry about a thing Next
time we come to town, we gonna/am.
You sold the bus? Everybody
wants to be in the trapezoid!
Yes, I sold the bus. You remember
high finance! You gonna die poor!
Dwayne, would you go, please?
I wanna ask you- Did you say
someth-- Don't ask me nothin'.
The lady thinks the pentagon's
better than a trapezoid.
Oh, my God! [Renfie w] Ladies
and gentlemen, just keep calm!
You sold the bus?
Yes!
Everybody keep calm! My associates
had a slight altercation,
but, uh--
Now, wait. Don't crowd!

[Schuyler] Good-bye: children.
Good-bye: Linda.
I hope you feel better.
Good-bye.
You must be Miss Perry
and Mr. Braxton.
Uh, what's wrong?
What are you doing here?
I'm Gladys Schuyler, and this is my
husband Alfred, whom I believe you met.
Yes, but...
what's going on?
Well, these children have told us
about all the wonderful things...
that you did for them.
Hitchhiking 300 miles in a snowstorm
when your bus broke down.
And sitting up all night for a week with
little Linda when she had the fever.
Helping Harold learn Italian in Braille.
Malta grazie.
[Sti? Ed Laughter] [Gladys]
You people are terrific.
You know, these are
really wonderful children,
and they deserve e very chance
they can get. [Siren Approaching]
[Siren Blaring]
All right, Braxton,
this is it.
Officer, this man is in violation of
his parole. I'm his parole officer.
I'm taking him, this woman and
these brats back to Philadelphia.
- What's going on here? - You heard me. I'm
taking these people back to Philadelphia.
Do you have a warrant
for my arrest?
Well?
No.
- I'm not going back.
- She's staying.
Who the hell are you? That's Mr.
Schuyler, our town mayor.
All right, now, look, this woman has
violated at least 20 federal statutes.
Number one: kidnapping. [Alfred]
You want a legal battle?
All right, I'm gonna get on the phone.
I'm gonna get a warrant for his arrest,
for her arrest-- [Alfred]
Hold on a minute, friend.
Before you get off the phone, all these
children will be registered in the state.
And I'm having the farm transferred
back to Miss Perry in her name...
with a big enough loan so she can
operate it properly [Kids Cheering]
But this man is still under myjurisdiction.
[Joe] Dona/d...
take it easy, man.
I'll go back with you.
[Kids, Vivian Protesting]
I gotta go back. I did something. Don't
worry. Please don't go, we need you!
We have a reason
for you to stay.
Dear Mr. Braxton, we,
the children of this house,
pardon you for the crimes
you have done...
because we know...
you is sorry...
you did them.
You have to read it.
"We wish that when we grow up we
're fine people just like you.
From this day on,
you are off parole...
and nobody can
stop you no more."
[Joe]
This is real special.
I just-- I did something
wrong, you know,
and I made a deal
with the government...
to let me off,
to stay on parole.
That's my parole officer,
and I gotta go back.
[Linda Crying]
Don't go back.
Shh, don't cry.
All right, Braxton,
let's go.
I'll give you a minute
to say good-bye.
Hey, stop it. Don't try
to drive no buses.
[Harold]
Yeah.
Hey, big mama, come here.
Come here.
Hey, man, you're
gonna make me cry.
[Kids Laughing]
No more swearing.
[Laughing]
I love you.
Thanks.
I ain't no loser. I'm
a tough Puerto Rican.
[Laughing]
You better
believe it, man.
[Engine Starts]
What happened?
Get out.
Go on back home.
[Laughs]
Joe's back!
