Good morning, sir. Can I help you at all?
Good morning. I was just
looking at this mirror.
Oh, it's a lovely piece,
is that, sir. Quite lovely.
A little expensive, I'm afraid.
- How much are you asking for it?
- £250.
- For this?
- You see, it's a genuine antique.
Very old.
Come on. Look at the glass. Look at the back.
It's been treated. I know my antiques.
I'll tell you what. I'll give
you 25 quid to get rid of it.
What do you say?
Very well.
It's a deal.
So, I told the old fool it was a
reproduction, and he believed me.
Wasn't that a bit dishonest?
Not at all. Just good business practice.
It brightens the place up, don't you think?
- How old is it?
- Oh, 400 years, I should say.
- Oh, it gives me the shivers.
- Why?
I don't know.
It looks like something that
belongs in a medium's parlor.
- Let's hold a séance.
- What?
- Let's hold a séance.
- What a splendid idea.
Get the stuff off the table and
pull it into the middle of the room.
It's séance time!
But you don't know anything
about holding a séance.
My talents are limitless. Watch.
Hands on the table.
Fingers touching.
And concentrate.
- What on?
- Just empty your minds.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
EDWARD: There is something.
Come in.
Is anyone here?
Go away.
EDWARD: Come in.
Whoever you are, come in.
Come in.
(SCREAMS)
What happened?
What happened?
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Come.
You must feed me.
- You gave me a turn.
- I'm sorry.
Looking for a girl?
Well, my place is just around the
corner. Five quid and no hurry.
- I'd rather go to my place.
- How far is it?
Just off the edge of Ware Road.
It's rather a long way, darling.
You'll have to make it worth me while.
(EX CLAIMS)
You are nice and comfy in here.
What a lovely room you've got.
Do you think I could have a little drink?
- Yes, of course. Whiskey?
- Lovely.
Nothing like a drop of the
hard stuff to turn me on.
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)
- You got a window open?
- No.
Now!
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)
Feed me
blood.
No.
No.
No!
How many more?
Until I am fulfilled.
(MUSIC PLA YING)
- Should we go after this?
- Then what?
- Then I'll take you home.
- Whose home?
Well, you have three roommates.
(SCREAMING)
Why?
A long time ago
I gave my sacrifices.
Now you must give them to me.
(WIND CHIMES TINKLING)
Soon I can walk
in daylight.

(PHONE RINGING)
PAM: Hello, Edward?
- Is that you, Edward?
- Pam.
Are you all right? I've been ringing
and ringing and never get a reply.
I've been out.
Is something the matter? You sound a bit...
No, no, I'm all right.
Oh, well, that's fine. Shall I come around?
No. No, don't do that.
Edward? Are you still there?
Are you sure you're all right?
Pamela, why don't you
come around this evening?
About 9:00.
You are learning.
Do as I tell you,
and soon it will all be finished.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Let her in.
(DOOR HANDLE RATTLING)
Not this girl.
Edward!
Not Pamela.
I need more.
Edward, are you there?
People know her. They'll know where she is.
Find me another.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
Are you all right? Edward?
Go home.
Go home.
You be nice and quiet while
I'm reading this story to you.
And don't fall asleep, understand?
"The wind was howling.
Suddenly the door opened,
"and a werewolf was standing there
with blood dripping from his mouth. "
EDWARD: Who is it?
It's Mr. Jeffrey, the
man from the flat below.
Oh, blimey! Are you all right?
It's no wonder you look the way you
do, the way you've been carrying on.
Carrying on?
If you must entertain your lady
friends, quiet it down a bit.
And what's all this hammering
going on in the middle of the night?
- Hammering?
- Yeah.
And if you must spill anything,
for Pete's sake, mop it up.
I'm getting bloody big
patches all over my ceiling.
Patches?
(DOOR RATTLING)
(BANGING ON DOOR)
Now look here...
(CAT SCREECHING)
SPIRIT: Edward.
Edward.
This, I fear, is the end.
It is to be regretted that our
fruitful association must terminate.
But the vessel is, in more respects than one,
full and indeed overflowing.
Now I am replete.
The wheel has turned full circle, almost.
You alone can seal that circle.
Give me the power to walk
abroad and join the others.
- The others?
- We are legion.
We sit in high places and fan discord.
Once beyond the ultimate, we can
feed and gorge ourselves forever.
What is the ultimate?
You helped me to come here.
It is only right that I
should assist you to go there.
Grip my shoulders.
Now thrust forward.
Have patience. You have all eternity.
(CAT MEOWING)
(MUSIC PLA YING)
Yes, I was lucky, wasn't I?
- No, no. Here.
- Great.
Okay?
That mirror,
it looks like something that
belongs in a medium's parlor.
- Then let's hold a séance.
- What?
Let's hold a séance.
Clear the things off the table
and move it into the room.
It's séance time.
I'll light the candle.
Laces, matches.
Laces, matches.
Laces, matches.
Laces.
- Thank you very much, sir. You're a gent.
- Not at all.
Matches, laces.
(MAN CHA TTERING ON RADIO)
What's that?
Shoelaces. I bought them
from one of those peddlers.
A beggar?
He's not exactly a
beggar. He's got a license.
They don't expect you to take
anything though, now do they?
And how much did you give him?
20... 30 pence.
I expect he thought you were a right mug.
Probably got more money than
you'll see in a lifetime.
A chap at school says he knows a
man who sells matches by the station,
and he has a Rolls-Royce.
I don't think matches and
shoelaces can run Rolls-Royces.
I never heard of such nonsense.
With more mugs like you, he
could run a fleet of them.
Sausages again?
If you gave me a bit more money,
you might get something better.
Oh, I give you an adequate
housekeeping allowance.
Prices aren't what they used to be.
Well, have you any complaints then?
Who do you think you're talking
to in that tone of voice?
Some of the girls at your office?
To them you may be the boss,
but I know what you really
are. A jumped up clerk.
That's all an office manager is.
Oh, things were different
when we got married.
You were a sergeant in the Pay Corps.
Soft job, civilian future. Some future.
I won't be spoken to in this
way! I won't, I won't, I won't!
Don't you get violent with me!
Get on with your dinner.
Good morning.
I find I'm out of matches.
Yes, one this, you see?
I'm thanking you for your kindness, sir.
- You're a genuine at heart, sir.
- Nonsense.
I can't pass by an old soldier. I
was in the army myself during the war.
I knew you'd been a military man
as soon as I laid eyes on you.
- It stands out a mile, it does.
- Grand days.
I often wish I were back, you know.
May I ask, sir, which outfit you was with?
I was attached to the infantry
for most of the duration.
- I bet you was decorated, sir?
- Yes.
Yes, as a matter of fact, yes.
- Cheerio.
- God bless you, sir.
Here we are.
Yes, it's to replace the one I lost.
You won't mind my asking, sir,
but do you have certificate?
- Certificate?
- Yeah, to show that you won it.
The Distinguished Service Order.
Oh, yes, I won it all
right. I was in the desert.
- You know, Monty's.
- Very warm out there.
- Then you do have the certificate?
- Yes. Oh, yes, yes, yes.
I'll bring it with me next time.
I'll put it aside for you then
till you come in. Excuse me.
Couldn't let you have it without.
Otherwise every Tom, Dick and Harry
would be after one, wouldn't they?
- That wouldn't be fair, would it?
- No.
- Good-bye. -
Good-bye to you, sir.
(BELLS TINKLING)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Naughty.
Shouldn't have done that.
PEDDLER: It's very handsome, sir.
Not many of the gentlemen got one of those.
LOWE: I thought you'd like to see it.
You know, sir, I've been thinking.
You've been very nice to me, sir,
and I've really enjoyed our little chats.
And the fact is, I was wondering
whether you would do me the honor,
the really very great honor, of
coming around to my place one evening
and having a cup of tea.
Thank you, thank you.
That's very nice of you.
Don't be afraid to refuse,
sir. I should quite understand.
It's just that me and Emily,
sir, that's my daughter,
we would be that proud.
And you'd only have to stay a minute or two.
Just long enough to sup a little drop up,
maybe nibble a little bit
of Emily's homemade cake.
As I say, don't be afraid to
refuse. Does quite understand.
No hard feelings.
Well, no doubt one evening.
Oh, thank you, sir. Shall we say tomorrow?
- Perhaps...
- Thursday, sir?
- Yes. Thursday, yes. -
Right-o, sir. Thursday it is.
Something strange happened to me today.
A man took my picture.
Probably one of those street fellows.
Did he give you a card to fill out?
No, he didn't.
Probably thought you
weren't a likely customer.
Get on with your homework.
(HORN HONKING)
I thought you might lose your way, sir.
So I got myself all spruced up
so you wouldn't mind walking alongside me.
How honored we are, sir, you'll never know.
It's a humble enough little flat, sir.
It isn't far. My Emily's got the kettle on.
Lovely evening.
Here we are, sir.
Up the stairs.
Up you go, sir.
Watch out for the sixth
step. It's a bit loose.
It's rather dark in here,
sir. The bleeding landlord...
Pardon my French, sir.
Won't put a light in.
One more room to cross
sir, and then we're there.
Emily can't wait to meet you, sir.
Emily, come show yourself, my girl.
This is the gentleman.
This is my daughter, Emily.
Hello. Christopher Lowe.
And my name is Underwood. Jim Underwood.
- Doesn't she make a smashing cake, sir?
- Oh, yes, indeed. Yes.
And she's a deep one.
She reads books with jaw-cracking words.
Say something out of a book, Emily.
"Judicial manners are a matter
for prudential judgment. "
Yes. Yes, words are wonderful toys.
The more we know, the more we are enriched.
Are you listening, Emily?
It's not often you get a
chance to hear an educated gent.
Another piece of cake?
I hope you're getting paid for
all this overtime you're doing.
- Executive staff are not paid overtime.
- Executive staff.
Mr. Robinson, who is a plain,
honest machine operator,
brings home twice your money every week.
- Well, how long is it going on?
- I don't know.
A few weeks, maybe.
Get on with your sweet.
Matches, laces.
Shall we have the honor
again this evening, sir?
Yes. Oh, yes.
Look, Dad, a wristwatch. Real gold.
- I'm afraid not.
- It is gold to her, sir.
Real hard gold.
Let me see, sir. That cuff
is a little bit frayed?
I would've thought your good lady
would have set that right, sir.
She's very busy.
No, she's not.
She spends half her day at
bingo, gossiping with friends
or heaven knows what.
- House is a disgrace.
- That is a crying shame, sir.
Don't go thinking about her.
(MOANING)
(SCREAMING)
Whatever on earth's the matter?
It was a dream. Bad dream.
That's very kind of you, but
really you shouldn't have.
She worries about you, sir.
She reckons you don't get the right
food. Just eat a little of it, sir.
To make her happy.
It looks delicious. Truly delicious.
I'm sorry I can't stay to enjoy some myself.
I've got a date with some of the
lads, but Emily will look after you.
- Won't you, Emily?
- Right, Dad.
I should be back around midnight.
Thank you.
(EMILY HUMMING)
Soon you'll be free
Soon you'll be free
The chains will fall
Then we'll be parted no more
The dead can't clutch
Can't hold on tight
Eaten by worms
In the cold winters
We comes from where
Oh, nobody knows
But we knows what we knows
And we keeps it to ourselves
That's a funny song.
- Singing was I?
- Yes.
I forget myself sometimes.
- It was very nice.
- It wasn't really singing.
Just making up words.
- You are a lonely man.
- No, no.
Not when I'm with you.
Your body is aging, but you are not.
Well, I'm not as young as I was.
And that woman, she's not a wife to you.
What's come over you? You've
never spoken like this before.
I wish to serve you.
I will do anything you ask. Anything at all.
You have only to order, but you must order.
It must be your will.
Let's think.
You... You'll...
You...
You will...
You will...
You must tell me again
what you want me to do.
About what, darling?
- This.
- What is it?
- Do you wish me to uncover it?
- If you like.
- No. If you like.
- All right. Go ahead, uncover it.
- For God's sake. No, darling.
- Why not?
You hate her. She despises you.
As the years race by, your
life will become more miserable
for she will not improve with age.
Whereas one quick stab... Just order me.
Do what you want. Do what you want.
Then you order me to do it?
- Do what you want.
- No. What you want.
All right, if it makes you
happy. Drive the thing in.
I obey your order.
Your order has been carried out.
It's a trick. Mabel is
at home now alive. She...
- You can't kill her with nonsense like that.
- Why don't you go home and see?
(DOG BARKING)
Mabel?
Mabel?
What happened? Tell me what happened.
Mum went to answer the door.
There was a lady dressed
in black. She had a pin.
(DOORBELL RINGING)
Raise your glasses.
Here's to you both.
Long life, good health
and every happiness possible.
Here's to you both.
Long life, good health and
every happiness possible.
Thank you.
Go on, Emily, darling, cut the cake.
- Shall I?
- Yes.
- You want me to?
- Yes.
- You want me to?
- Yes, of course.
You want me to?
Of course, darling. We're all waiting.
You see, Stephen...
We always answer children's prayers.
In one way or another.
(BELLS TINKLING)
Anyone at home?
SHOPKEEPER: Good morning, sir.
- Can I tempt you with anything?
- Yes.
Yes, I was looking for a snuff box.
- Now, I have a very fine selection, sir.
- Yes, I've been looking at them.
- And which one struck your fancy?
- Well, I'll have that one, I think.
And a very good choice, if I may so, sir.
Excuse me, I'll just find
out how much that'll cost you.
- This is a very fine piece, too, isn't it?
- Yes, it is indeed.
Excuse me.
- That will cost you £5, sir.
- Shall we say £4?
Oh, you do strike a hard bargain.
Well, things being what they are, it's yours.
Thank you.
- Shall I wrap it up for you?
- No, no, no, no.
Don't bother. I'll take it as it is.
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much indeed.
I hope you enjoy snuffing it.
- Good day to you.
- Good day.
(CASH REGISTER RINGING)
There's an elemental on your shoulder.
He's a killer.
No, you really must listen to me.
He's a particularly nasty
specimen. A real stinker.
And he's growing stronger every moment.
Madam, would you kindly desist?
Have you been feeling weak,
run down, overtired recently?
Yes, yes, yes, I see you have.
Well, you see, he's feeding on
you, the nasty, vicious thing.
I confess that I've never
seen a homicidal before.
Sex starved, yes. Alcoholic,
often. But killers, very rare.
You may consider yourself privileged.
- Well, what exactly is...
- An elemental?
Oh, it's a spirit of air, fire and water.
An invisible, bodiless creature
which lusts after the pleasures of the flesh.
It sucks the very juices of the soul.
Let us inspect this friend of yours.
Oh, dear. Oh, he is firmly imbedded.
Oh, that nasty, vicious thing, he spat at me.
Oh, it's no good trying to rub him off.
Not in a lifetime will you rub him off.
I've got your measure, my lad.
It's no good you glowering at me.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
we're approaching my station.
No, no, no. Wait a moment, wait a moment.
I have it here, I know.
Wait just one moment.
Yes. Here it is. My card.
No, really, I have to
get off here, I'm afraid.
No, take it, take it. You'll need it.

Well, good day to you, madam.
My fees are very reasonable.
Hello, Mr. Hawkins, old boy. Here then.
Come on, come here.
All right, you stupid brute. Now come here.
Well, suit yourself.
Hello, darling.
Have a good day.
Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes.
Could I have a gin and tonic, please?
(DOG BARKING)
Look, what is the matter
with you, you stupid beast?
(DOG WHINING)
- What's with that ridiculous animal?
- What?
- The dog. He just sat there barking at me.
-  Thank you, darling. Cheers.
Why are you hunching your
left shoulder like that?
I think I'll have a bath.
(GASPS)
(GLASS SHATTERING)
- What on earth did you do that for?
- What?
You know darn well. You just hit me.
Don't be ridiculous. I never touched you.
Now, look, there's only
the two of us in this room,
and I certainly didn't hit myself.
I tell you, I never touched you.
How could I? I was nowhere near you.
Look, it's not important,
so there's no need to lie.
On the contrary, it is important.
I tell you, I did not hit
you. I was nowhere near you.
Go and have your bath. Your
dinner will soon be ready.
Darling, I love you holding my
hand, but don't press so hard.
- I'm not touching your hand.
- Yes, you are.
Darling, you must cut your nails.
Oh, Reggie.
Reggie!
What is it?
Reggie. Stop.
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, my God.
Susan, what in the name
of hell are you playing at?
- Get off me!
- Susan, for crying out...
(SUSAN GROANING)
- Darling, what's the matter?
- You stay away.
Don't you come near me.
What have I done?
You know I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.
- You tried to strangle me.
- Me?
Awful hands like talons.
Hot, foul breath.
All right. All right, get back into bed.
I won't come near you. I promise.
I'll sit in the chair, and
I'll leave the light on.
The stench, it's awful.
It's still there.
Look, Susan. Susan.
Madam Orloff.
(PHONE RINGING)
Madam Orloff, clairvoyant extraordinaire,
messages from beyond the specialty, speaking.
REGGIE: Madam Orloff, my
name is Reginald Warren.
I hope you remember me. I
was the man on the train.
Oh, yes, of course I remember you. Yes.
Yes, you were the man with
that nasty little elemental
burrowing into your shoulder. I
expect you want me to have a go at him.
He tried to strangle my wife.
What's that?
I don't hear you, my dear man. He did what?
He tried to strangle my wife.
Oh, yes, yes, I expected it.
I told you he was homicidal.
Well, stay put, and I'll bolt down there.
It is rather a nuisance because
I have one table tapping session
and a voice from beyond
on the books for tomorrow
but never mind.
It can't be helped. Well,
give me your address.
Oak Cottage, Hillside, Surrey.
Cottage, Hillside, Surrey, right. Fine.
Well, now eat nothing until I get there.
We don't want to feed him
or we might have a materialization
on our hands, understand?
Materialization?
Oh, his main objective is to
get inside you, to take over.
You follow me?
Well, I'll take your word for it.
Good man. Then I'll see you about 10:00.
- Can I get a taxi from the station?
- No, but I'll pick you up in the car.
Oh, no, fatal, fatal.
He'll run you off the road
if he knows I'm coming.
No, no, I'll hire a car
and add it to the bill.
All right, all right.
Just get here, that's all.
Very well. Good-bye.
Oh, Madam Orloff, thank heavens. Do come in.
- Yes. Good morning.
- Good morning.
How good of you to come so quickly.
Oh, my, my. We have grown. Yes, indeed.
Sucking up the fluids like a
babe at its mother's breast.
Do pass through.
Smells a bit pongy, doesn't he?
- Good morning.
- My wife.
- How do you do?
- Madam Orloff.
- Did your dog run away?
- Yes. How did you know?
Animals always know. Animals
and some small children.
They can actually see them, you understand.
How did he become attached to me?
Have you traveled in a tube train recently?
Yes. I couldn't get a taxi yesterday.
There you are. I thought so.
You see, that damned
underground is packed with them.
Well, now, to work.
We must try to dislodge him.
I wonder, my dear, would you
mind closing the curtains?
Light is apt to put me off my stroke.
Now let me see.
Sit here. Here.
This plain, straight-back
chair and sit down.
We must get him out or
he'll be at her throat again,
as sure as a cat has kittens.
I don't follow the usual form, you know,
so don't be surprised at anything I say.
It's simply ways and means
of concentrating my powers.
Dark, foul thing from
down below, get thee hence,
or I'll bestow a curse
upon your hardened soul
and turn your black heart into coal.
Don't grind your teeth.
I'll force you out with all my strength.
(THUNDER CRACKING)
I'll push and squeeze you like a length
of toothpaste, till you scream with fear.
(WIND HOWLING)
I'll teach you who's master here.
Get out of it, you black-hearted basket.
I'll crack your heart, you hellish lout.
And I'll crush your soul
and smash your snout.
Get out, out, out!
I really must have a breather.
I'm sweating like a pig.
I fear I must ask you for a
little Scotch and water, my dear.
It's very thirsty work, this.
You must watch that one. She's hot stuff.
She'll attract them like
flies to a dung heap.
They'll be into her like a knife into
butter, if you'll pardon the phrase.
Oh, how quick. Thank you, my dear.
You shouldn't run like that.
You'll strain something.
Right.
Now...
strain.
Work, man, work.
Strain hard.
Fat, foul fiend, you know
damn well you don't live here.
Your place is hell.
(CRASHING)
Snarling, crawling, spitting tom.
Growling, snarling.
Harder, harder. Get thee gone.
We've got him!
Flee through the windows. Fly from the gate.
Flogged by my power.
Flayed by my hate.
May you burn in the fire.
May you freeze in the flood.
May your foul soul baste
in its own boiled blood.
(SCREAMS)
He's coming out. Yes, he's coming out.
As smoothly as an eye leaves its socket.
He's fighting every inch of the way.
Out you go, my beauty.
Out to the place where the witch fires glow.
Where the white worms crawl
from the sinner's grave.
Leave us forever.
Away.
Away!
Away!
Away!
(REGGIE COUGHING)
Well, it's a bit of a ruddy mess.
But as someone once said, you can't
make an omelet without breaking eggs.
I'm afraid my fee for this
will be rather high, my dear.
I shall need £50 for this little do.
Worth every penny, Madam
Orloff. I can't thank you enough.
Oh, good gracious me.
- I feel like...
- Like a feather.
- Yes.
- Yes.
A great weight lifted from your shoulder.
I know, I know.
Well, now, I mustn't keep
the car waiting any longer.
The fare will cost you a fortune.
Now, cheer up, cheer up, dear.
There's nothing to worry your
little head about any longer.
- I'll see you out.
- Oh, thank you.
- Naughty.
- There you are.
I'll send you a check,
Madam Orloff, if I may.
Thank you so very much.
And do call on me if there's anything
more you need in the psychic line.
Half price on Thursday.
(DOG BARKING)
Come inside. There's a good boy.
Come on then. Come through
to your mistress. Come on.
Well, it's all over, darling.
- Cheers.
- Gung ho.
What have we got for supper? I'm starving.
- Cold roast lamb.
- Oh, whoopee.
- Funny old girl, isn't she?
- Who, Madam Orloff?
Pretty good at her job, though.
(FOOTSTEPS PATTERING)
Reggie, what was that?
I suppose it's still here.

- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.
- A pretty tune, isn't it?
- Yes.
But really I'm rather more
interested in this door.
Oh, a remarkable piece of work that door.
Magnificent construction.
Yes, I rescued that myself
from the demolition man.
- Would you like to see it all over?
- Yes.
Kindly, lad, you'd be kind enough to
help me move some of my objets d'art.
That's very kind of you.
I'll take the picture of the boat.
Mind the lamp bracket.
Now, if you'll give me a hand...
- To me, lad.
- Right.
I'm getting a little old for this.
Thank you very much, young sir.
There now. There's your overall picture.
And all that carving, when
cleaned, will come up very fine.
- Very fine, indeed, sir.
- Yes, you're right.
It's absolutely fantastic.
- Now, what was behind it?
- A room.
Very elaborate in its day. All blue, it was.
- How much?
- Well, I could let you have it for £50.
Now, look, all I've got here is £40,
and that's gonna leave me flat broke.
Thank you very much.
- What name is it, sir?
- Seaton. William Seaton.
(CASH REGISTER RINGING)
S-
E-A-T-O-N.
S- E-A-T-O-N.
Seaton.
- I'll write you a receipt.
- All right, thank you.
S-
E-A-T-O-N.
- Here it is.
- Thank you. And that's my address.
Oh, I'll be needing that.
Thank you very much, indeed.
- Thank you.
Good-bye. - Good-bye.
I'll have the door delivered
just as soon as I possibly can.
(BELLS TINKLING)
One, two...
WILLIAM: Could you take it
through to the study, please?
It's straight ahead of you. That's right.
- Is that it?
- Yeah. Fantastic, isn't it?
- Come and have a look.
- What are you going to do with it?
I'm gonna re-paper all this wall,
and I'm gonna replace this
cupboard door with that.
Could you lean it up against
the wall for me, please?
- Right-o, sir. -
Thanks very much indeed.
- Just right in front of that cupboard.
- Right.
Lift her up.
Steady.
Okay. In there.
Lovely. You'll wipe it. Lovely.
- How's that?
- Beautiful. Thank you very much, indeed.
- Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. -
All right. Thank you, sir.
Bye.
It's a bit grand for a
cupboard door, isn't it?
No, I think it's rather fun.
- You are a fool, darling.
- Now you just wait till it's been cleaned.
There.
Looks like blood.
Well, what do you think?
A door like this should lead
to something a bit more exciting
than a stationery cupboard.
All right. What did you think was behind it?
I don't know.
It must have been a big room.
Very beautiful, too, I should think.
How about a huge old drawing room?
What else?
A great fireplace.
Double windows.
With an old-world garden beyond.
And the color. What about that?
I think it was blue.
Yes, definitely blue.
(FOOTSTEPS PATTERING)
(THUDDING)
(SCRAPING)
William. You were staring at the pot.
- What?
- What is it, darling?
- It's blue, like the room.
- What room?
Behind that door is a room.
Only sometimes it isn't there.

"An experiment in darkness,
by Sir Michael Sinclair.
"Written in this the 22nd year of
the reign of his gracious majesty,
"King Charles II.
"Instructions as to the entrapment
of those yet to be born. "
SINCLAIR: I have devoted
these many years to the pursuit
of that knowledge which men call evil.
Men avert their eyes
rather than meet my glance,
for I wear my knowledge
about me like a cloak.
They whisper about me in corners,
and there is much talk of witchcraft.
Were I not who I am, I might fear the stake.
I prepared me the room after many
years, and at the expense of much blood.
A ghost room, kept alive by the life essences
of those who have been sacrificed to it.
But even as the body needs food,
the earth needs fertilizing,
so the room from time to time must be fed.
Therefore, I prepared me the door,
seeping it in blood that was still warm
and making it a trap that will function
in the time that has yet to come
to trap the souls of those
who are yet to be born.
They will come in when the time is
right and give up their bodies and souls
that I in the room may continue to be.
Or I will go forth beyond the door
and find me a woman of their kind.
For a woman hath a more enduring quality.
(THUDDING)
William, why are you...
(ROSEMARY GASPS)
There is a room. I was in it.
And there was a man. He
followed me into the house.
If his purpose is what you said
it was, why didn't he continue?
- Because he saw you.
- What?
"For a woman hath a more enduring quality. "
We've got to get out of here. You
pack some things, I'll get the car.
- But this is silly. I mean...
- Just do as I say!
(BELL TOLLING)
It's jammed.
Telephone.
(ROSEMARY SCREAMING)
Come. Come!
Two souls are better than one.
(LAUGHING)
(SCREAMS)
(SINCLAIR SCREAMING)
Rosemary, the door!
Smash it! Smash the door!
(SCREAMS)
(THUNDER CRACKING)

34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40.
All correct.
(GASPS)
(GASPS)
Don't worry, sir, just my little joke.
I'm preparing these for a client.
I've loaded that one.
Now I have to load its twin brother.
You are interested, sir?
Would you like to handle?
I'll pass them over in the correct fashion.
I've seen them do it on the films.
- Perfect.
- Yes, aren't they?
- Now put your hands up.
- Oh, come now, sir.
You wouldn't rob me. I know you wouldn't.
Now do as I say and do
it quick. First the till.
I'm warning you, I'm in a hurry.
- But, sir...
- Any nearer and I'll fire!
Nay, but I'm defenseless.
Bang your head, sir. You'll
do yourself an injury.
I'll shoot. I'm warning you, I'll shoot.
Nasty.
Oh, dear.
The love of money is the root of all evil.
(BELLS TINKLING)
Aye, customers. Come in. Come in.
I'm sure I have the very thing to tempt you.
Lots of bargains. All tastes catered for.
Oh, and a big novelty surprise
goes with every purchase.
Do come in. Any time.
I'm always open.
