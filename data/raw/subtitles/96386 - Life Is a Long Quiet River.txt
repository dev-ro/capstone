- 700g, Is that okay?
- Yes
Give me a pound of tomatoes,
very ripe.
Oh, they're ripe!
- I'm going to make a salad.
- Here you go.
LIFE IS A LONG STEADY RIVER
Good Evening
Once more, another car
was burned
in Moulin de la Vierge.
Once more, it was an
immigrant's car.
Good evening Dear!
Sorry I'm late,
It was a complicated birth.
I had to perform a caesarian.
In Moulin de la Vierge, suddenly
came the explosion.
- My car was brand new.  Now look at it!
- Your car was 2 years old!
Insurance doesn't cover this!
We work hard, and this
happens to us!
- Hooray!
- Who said that?
Taxes kill us.
What's this, "Oh là là"?
- I'm French, I am!
- And your sister?
If this keeps up...
- I'll seek justice myself.
- Whenever you're ready!
What a scandal!
What did you say?
I said, "Shhhhh"
Your dress is covered with stains.
No one will notice at night.
I'll raise 100.
Go on, Toc-Toc!
- What, Clubs weren't trump?
- Shit Ahmed, You don't get it.
What?  That's not the rules!
I hate bad sports.
Quiet, I can't count!
You're losing big, Ahmed.
- How much?
- 500
500?
Roselyne, that must be for you.
Roselyne's gonna spread...
the cards!
At least it's not with Arabs,
Eh, Ahmed?
Oh, that's nice!
What, You don't like the French?
- What kind of car is it?
- a "DS"
That's better.
- Hey!  It's the Electric Co!
- Shit!
Don't move!
This is the 7th time
you've called us.
I saw lights.
They're stealing power.
This time, they're busted.
Hi, Michel.
- You live here?
- Yes, with my parents.
See you!
- You know her?
- I've seen her around.
- Who is it?
- It's the Electric Company.
The door's open.
- And we don't forget
behind the ears.
Emmanuelle, brush in back too.
Father, Good Evening!
Evening, mother.
I brought home your kids.
- How kind.  Jean was just about
to get them.
Father Aubergé brought
the kids!
Thank you!
I also wanted to bring up a point
about our festival.
Are you busy?
- No, I just gave the little
ones their bath.
We had a good class tonight.
Pierre participated a lot.
And I got 45% on our quiz!
Why don't you go wash up
before dinner.
Come Father, I'll show you
what's ready.
I've only made 20 placemats,
and I haven't done the
costumes yet.
- Marielle,
That's a great start.
And there's only 15 of us.
No, don't get up.
Good Evening.
Madam Nectin will help.
She and her daughters are
making fruit pastries.
That's great!
Should I set the table?
Yes, but it's not your turn.
Good Evening!
By the way, We need a camp
counselor this summer.
You should sign up.
Gosh, I'd like that.
That will do him good.
Mmmm!  Something smells good!
It's Monday.  It's Ravioli!
Will you join us?
I've already imposed enough.
I'm off.
Let me show you out.
I'll see you tomorrow
at rehearsal!
Did you hear about
the explosion?
Yes, it's terrible.
It's a poor neighborhood with
juvenile delinquincy.
Can you really blame
the children?
I blame their parents.
Yes, it's troubling.
Goodnight.
Pierre!  Bernadette!
Ready for Dinner?
Jean, whenever you're ready.
- Perfect.
Let's dine!
Please hold!
Good Morning, Doctor.
Well!
Well?
I waited for you Yesterday!
Does room 7 still have a fever?
I don't care about 7.
You're still with your wife!
A little patience, Josette.
She's very ill.
A Little Patience?
I've waited 14 years for you!
I can't take it anymore!
I have no future here
in this lousy clinic.
YOU might win an award.
What did the analysis say?
It said nothing.
Just like you!
Look at me!
I've suffered too!
Shhhhhh...
- Keep it up,
That doesn't work anymore.
I'm cured.
Do you hear?
Thanks for the service.
Alright,
Is your little crisis over with?
Are we calm?
- Yes.
Very good then.
We can take care of
Madam Lemeg, OK?
Let's get to work?
- Yes.
Cuckoo Bird!
## C'est comme ça
# (La la la la la)
# Je ne veux pas t'abandonner,
mon bébé
# Je ne veux pas nous achever,
tu sais
# C'est comme ça
- Roselyne, are you sure
this is right?
- Yeah.
It's "pink champagne".
Where's Momo and Million?
The cops are sniffing around my place!
You gotta take this stuff, NOW!
Calm down, You Arab!
Do what you want, but
No shit on my floor!
Your shop brought the cops.
You like my shop.
It's cheap.
Dad, Tell him what we did to the
Arabs during the War.
I already told him.
- Don't get mad!
You'll ruin the color.
OK, I'm going!
- Put it in their room.
Momo will know what to do.
Awful Woman!
- Hey Ahmed,
Bring up some beer!
- and some nail varnish,
I'm all out!
and The National Enquirer.
When will Momo be back?
Momo's working.
"G. Lefebvre, 1908".
Damn, she's old!
450, 500...
550...620.
Throw it out!
What about the
coin purse?
- 39 francs, a pierced coin,
and an aspirin.
And the checkbook?
- Throw it out.
And her billfold?
- Medicare, Social Security cards,
a photo.
Throw it out.
Should we keep the purse?
No, never keep personal items.
Bon Voyage!
Oui! Oui! Oui!
Shhhh!
Who do I have this morning?
- Your dear friend,
Madam Le Quesnoy.
She has nice tits.
- What did you say?
- She has nice kids.
Good Morning!
Hello, Marielle!
I'm sorry I didn't visit Collette, but
I know she's doing better.
- More or less.
Lovely necklace!
- It's special.
It was my grandmother's.
- How is Jean and
the family?
Wonderful!
and Bernadette?
She's fine...Thanks.
- Nothing serious today?
- No, not really.
Okay, let's take a look.
Josette, I won't be
needing you.
- Monique, The phone's been ringing
for an hour!
- Marie-Therese,
please iron this.
Yes, madame.
What are you doing there?
- I'm bored.
- Go play with Charlotte.
- She and her mother
went to Paris.
Why don't we ever
go to Paris?
- Don't be silly.
What would we do there?
Go do something!
I have nothing to do.
- Come on, There's always
something to do.
Boys, I made Tapioca!
Goody!
Enjoy your nap?
Come down for tea.
Where's Bernadette?
Bernadette! My God!
What...
Have you gone mad?
Are you insane?
Have you seen yourself?
Sometimes I can't understand you.
When He returns
It will be a great day
(a great day)
To celebrate Him
who invented love
(He invented love)
In a stable
born from Mary
Nobody wanted Him
Jesus, Return

Jesus, Return

From high on your Cross
Show us the way
You who know it all so well
All his life,
He preached happiness and peace

He will pardon us...
like He did
for Judas!
Jesus, Return

"Aussitôt...
"les clochettes...
"du muguet...
"Les clochettes...
"du muguet se redressent..."
Toc-Toc!
Momo!
- The keys!
- Which keys?
The storage keys!
- Hey, Do you mind?
- We just needed something.
- Why aren't you in school?
- We've been sick.
- Nothing serious?
- No.
Are those your friends there?
Birds of a feather!
- I want to see your parents!
- Why?
Because if this keeps up, it's
correctional school for you!
Our parents are on vacation.
You think I'm stupid?
You, sit down!
Not one word!
- Mr. Petit picked
a nice wine for you.
For the duck, just keep it warm.
Enjoy!  Goodbye!
- Thank you.
Bye!
Hello!
- Oh well,
I won't say no!
A bit green.
Josette!
What are you doing?
I'm Coming!
I'm coming!
You're leaving already?
Won't you eat something?
- Nah,
I'm not hungry.
I'm really excited,
I just found "The Ring Cycle"
from Bayreuth.
Great.
- So I really want to hear it
right away.
See you tomorrow,
Cuckoo bird.
...throughout the day.
Especially avoid any uncertain
financial ventures.
and now, Leo...
Leo  -  a good situation awaits...
You will come into money
and a surprise.
- It's my Frank!
- Mommy!
Your Hair?
- Yeah, do you like it?
No.
You got paroled!
Oh, you're beautiful!
Mommy!
Happy Birthday!
Thank you, children.
Bravo, son.
You've made great progress.
Pierre practiced hard
to be ready.
One day he'll be famous.
Bernadette it's not that simple!
But, you're doing fine.
Papa, your present.
What is this?
A life-vest for the boat!
I remember you lost yours in
last summer's Regatta.
Hey, No bad memories tonight!
Anyway, this one is nicer.
Let me do it!
Telephone, telephone!
He's looks happy.
Hello?
No.
Oh, my God!
TO MY BELOVED WIFE
Dear Louis,
You have to move on.
She would have wanted it.
You shouldn't be alone.
Stay with us a few days!
I can never replace her.
My sincere condolences.
Dear Louis,
You have to move on.
You shouldn't be alone.
Stay with me a few days.
I can never replace her.
My Poor Louis...
"You can never replace her"?
That was obvious to see.
In fact, that day marked
a big change.
Not only did you lose your wife,
but also your career,
your reputation, your life.
Now I'm going to crush you
like a turd.
You will pay
for all the hurt you did.
All the marriage promises,
The baby you didn't let me keep,
All the Christmas days
I spent alone, crying.
Christmas, in fact,
12 years ago,
I cried so much.
Remember?
Chance would have it that
Mme Le Quesnoy
had her baby the same time
as another.
You had me put them to bed.
I didn't care.
It was Christmas,
and I was with you.
The delivery went well.
Both babies were there.
A miracle.
Did you take the mothers
to their rooms?
Yes!
Groseille, Le Quesnoy.
They won't have the same
chances in life.
Doctor,  your wife wants to know
about the party.
Tell her I'll meet her there.
But you said we'd spend
tonight together.
Not anymore.
You knew that and didn't
say anything?
Josette, Don't start!
I don't believe this!
There'll be other
Christmas's.
You're a monster.
That's right...
Well, I have to go.
We can talk tomorrow.
Take care of Mme Le Quesnoy.
Merry Christmas,  Josette!
They'll pay for this!
Mr. Le Quesnoy just arrived.
He wants to know...
It's a girl!
That Bitch!
That Bitch!
Oh, that Bitch!
That Bitch!
Oh, that Bitch!
That Bitch!
What's going on?
All of this is to tell you that
you've been feeding...
a little rich kid
for the past 12 years,
the son of the president of
The Electric Company.
Maurice Le Quesnoy.
Attached is his baby bracelet.
Oh fuck!  Those Bastards!
They chucked us the son of the
president of the Electric Company!
We can make money from this.
But Why?
Why?
Why,  Why?
Marielle, please,
I implore you, Calm down.
Get a hold of yourself.
This is a test that God
has sent us.
We must overcome it.
We must not let this scandal
affect the children.
Dr. Mavial is leaving town.
Listen, I've thought about this.
We cannot deny Maurice a
proper education.
It also seems unfair,
even criminal,
to abandon Bernadette.
She's our daughter too.
God gave her to us.
These people must have trouble
making ends meet.
A little financial support could
really arrange things.
Don't give an inch.
Maurice can come visit you
whenever he wants.
But I think it is best to leave
Bernadette out of this.
If it is best.
She's fragile...
Really?
She's fragile?
Well, do what's best.
Would you like a drink?
No thank you,  Miss.
Here are the 20 thousand francs.
Didn't we say 20 grand?
Madam, "20 grand"
is 20 thousand francs.
Oh okay,  I trust you.
Get my purse!
There's Momo now!
Where have you been?
You're all dirty!
Look!  There's your Dad.
Hello, Maurice.
Hello.
DOCTOR MAVIAL
Consultation by Appointment
Subject:  Life in the court of
François the 1st.
You have until the end of class.
Look at all the silver.
Is it worth a lot?
Sure!
How much is it worth?
- At least 10,000.
- 10,000 Francs!
With the others, it must be
worth millions!
Oh, surely!
Maurice, Don't you have
anything to do?
She said it's worth a fortune.
She exagerates.
Anyhow, it was a wedding gift.
Your grandmother gave us
a lot of things.
Go now!
You have your English lesson.
Marie-Therese,
Has your stomach grown?
No, I've always had
a big waist.
Maybe it's just my skirt.
Matthew,  give me your plate.
- Not too much.
- It's good for you.
- Why?
- If you drink something cold
after something hot,
it's bad for your teeth.
Ah, okay!
What a nice decoration!
Maurice used a Sunday dish.
And it's not Sunday!
It's more beautiful,
the silver dish.
There's bones.
No!
I took them all out.
Thank you.
Miss Hebrart is retiring early.
- Already?
- Yes.
Why was your brother
in prison?
He stole so we could eat.
That's not fair!
I know.
Your father doesn't work?
My father got injured in
the Algerian War.
And your Mother?
She has much to do...
laundry, dishes, the kids,
and she has to change
dad's diapers.
She wanted to be a singer.
Me too!
Will you see them again?
No, That would cause
too much pain.
Go ask mother, Maurice!
-  Where's mother?
-  In the bathroom.
What did she say?
"Yes".
She said, "Yes."
Sleep tight!
Oh, Dr Schweitzer!
He had an extraordinary life,
and was very brave.
Thank you for the present.
It's very pretty.
Good night!
Sleep tight, boys!
- What's this called?
- The keel.
- And this?
- The oar.
- And this?
- The rudder.
And this is the tow-rope.
- And we never forget...?
- Our life-vests!
Bravo! Bravo!
Now let us play!
Would anyone like a glass
of fresh juice?
Oh, Yes!
Here you go, Gran.
Thank you dear!
You are so nice!
Some cake?
Let's play.
I get Maurice.
- No, he's with us!
- Come on, you're the biggest!
He reminds me of Jean
when he was little.
Serious...
and kind.
It's a miracle.
He's adapted so quickly.
If you knew what we went
through at first.
And his brothers and sisters?
They all adore each other.
And, they don't ask too
many questions?
No, they believe we adopted him.
It was an expensive lie, but there
was no other choice.
It's worth it.
Jean and Maurice thought it up
to save Bernadette.
That's wonderful!
If you knew how I prayed!
I know.
You are very brave.
Maurice!
Come here!
All your brothers and sisters
got a medallion and a chain.
"Yours", I couldn't give to you.
Now, it is done.
The wrong is fixed!
Thanks, Gran!
How did they get so rich?
They must have sold Momo!
Don't say that!
Pick me up tomorrow
for the cinema.
It's "Wild Kingdom".
You already saw it.
I'm going back!  I love animals.
And besides, people were talking.
Lazy bitch!
She takes a taxi to the supermarket,
and she's rude to the driver.
She's disgusting!
Don't play with her!
When He entered Jerusalem...
The entire town was abuzz.
"But Who is He?", they said.
And the crowd said, "It is the
Prophet - Jesus of Nazareth."
What is it?
You don't feel well, Maurice?
My stomach hurts.
- Do you want to go home?
- Yes.
Do you want your brother
to go with you?
No, I'll be okay.
I want him to stay
so I can read his notes.
Are you sure you'll be alright?
Yes, it happens sometimes,
but it's not serious.
Who the hell did that to you!
What the...
Come here!
Come here!
Oh Shut up!
Hey, what a difference!
He looks good.
If you don't change him back,
I'll call the cops!
Hey sweetie, You're going to change
him back to Arab.
- I don't have black dye.
- I want him Arab!
He's cute!
You shoud leave him like this.
That's enough!
Hey, You're doing well.
One less mouth to feed!
- What do you mean?
- I don't see you in my shop.
I go to the supermarket now.
You're all ingrates.
The only good one here was Momo,
and he's gone!
Momo! My Momo!
Get lost, Ahmed!  Can't you see what
you're doing to her?
Crocodile Tears!
Watch out!
Franck will get you.
Get out of here!
Crocodile Tears, yeah!
Let's go!
Crocodile Tears!
- Did you finish your homework?
- I'm just redoing my math.
Maurice, I found your chain and
medallion under your pillow.
That's not a good place
to keep it.
You should keep it in your desk.
There was also a lot of money there.
-  That's my savings from before.
- You really have a lot!
We never spent any money.
We were too poor.
If you want, we'll talk to Papa.
But I think it's best to put it
in the bank.
I'd rather keep it with me.
As you wish.
But think!
Your brothers all have accounts.
It's practical, you know.
We'll talk about it later.
Bitch!
Where did you put the thymbals
and egg cups?
They're in their place.
No, I am asking you because
they're not here.
Madame, I swear...
Don't swear, Marie-Therese!
Never mind, I remember.
I put them away.
Go finish the dishes!
Yes, I'd rather...
Momo! Momo!
I almost didn't recognize you.
-  It's my haircut.
- Yeah, it must be that.
- The family says hello.
- Really?
Is that a new jacket?
- Yeah.
It's nice.
- We bought it.
- Bought it?
Tell me,
Why did you come here?
Well you know, the Quesnoys...
They didn't pay us too much.
We're broke.
Have any ideas?
Hello, this is Marcelle Groseille!
I want to thank Mr. Le Quesnoy
for giving us free electricity.
Oh no!
Really, it's very kind.
Life is very hard for us.
And down deep,
we miss Momo very much.
It's much harder than we thought.
Momo helped out so much.
We need...
Twice as much?
Oh yeah!
Twice as much as before.
Okay, it would be great if
Mr. Le Quesnoy...
- Are you sure this is right?
- We've discussed this.
Yes, I know.
I'm sorry.
Betty buys a bit of butter.
Betty buy a bit of bootter.
- Marmelade.
- Marmelade.
- Through the window.
- Shroo the vindow.
Maybe we'll do better
with a reading.
Maurice!
Are you day-dreaming?
Yes.
It's my turn!  It's my turn!
It's my turn!
Now, the BAKER family...
Are they DANISH?
Ah, shit!
I'll never make a family.
- How many do you have?
- Four, plus the sugar bowl.
Let me see!
Don't worry, there's more.
And tell Ahmed about it.
See you later!
- You know them?
- Yeah.
- They're from "Moulin"?
- Yeah.
- So, they're poor?
- Yeah, So what?
I don't like poor people.
- You don't like poor folk?
- No.
But, you're poor too.
Dad runs the Electric Co.!
My dad does - not yours.
You're stupid!
You're stupid.
You haven't figured it out?
We were born on the
same day.
If I tell you a secret, do you
promise not to repeat it?
Brémont's daughter introduced
me to her fiancé.
He looks very nice, and
he's going to be a doctor.
His name is Sherman.
Eat your soup while it's hot.
Sherman...
He must be Jewish.
Yes, you're probably right.
But, he's charming.
They're supposed to marry
this Autumn.
They'll surely find a
marvelous apartment.
I'm happy for her.
She hasn't had it easy until...
See you tomorrow!
- Go home by yourself.
- Mom won't like that.
I don't care!
I could go for a warm stew.
We'd be better off on the
Riviera, eh Fredo?
It could be like a honeymoon.
What do you think?
There's that prissy bitch again!
Who does she think she is?
Get her, Toc-Toc!
Slut!
I'd do her.
Fredo!
Look who's here!
Hey, you're cute.
And I love your hair.
She's like a young Roselyne!
Come closer!
We won't bite.
Who is she?
It's Bernadette, your sister.
Stop playing with your pen!
Make an effort!
It's not that hard.
When the direct object comes before,
you must accord.
If it comes after...
Bernadette!
Bernadette!
Why did you leave Emmanuelle
on the street?
Bernadette, I order you to
open this door!
Open it right now!
- Jean,  please!
Can I help, Papa?
I'll talk to her.
She's not speaking to you now,
but she accepts your maid.
That's a good start.
She's in a state of shock.
She needs rest.
If she doesn't eat much,
it's alright.
What bothers me is...
her obsession with cleanliness.
Does she wash often?
All day long, doctor.
The medicine will make her relax.
I'm also prescribing you a
mild sedative to help you cope.
Bernadette, open the door!
It's me.
Who?
Marie-Therese!
- I want rice pudding.
- Marie-Therese didn't have time.
- Eat your raisin bread.
- I want rice pudding.
-  This is crazy - It's the 3rd time
I've changed the sheets today.
Kids, go eat in the garden.
She wants me to run a bath again.
A whole week this has gone on!
If this keeps up, she'll croak.
And I don't know what you did,
but she hates you.
Marie-Therese, please.
However, she loves me.
How could she have found out?
Maurice, maybe?
Maurice?
No, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
Why does she hate us so?
Marielle, try to understand.
She lived in a nice balanced family.
We did everything for her.
Then she finds out she comes
from that dirty place,
that disgusting mother
and awful kids!
It's a nightmare!
We must surround her with our love.
Let's be patient.
It's a miracle Maurice got out
of there unscathed.
Papa, I can't go Sunday.
- I was invited to the "Groseilles".
- Like the jam?
Why sure, Maurice.
It's understood you can go there
whenever you want.
I'm glad you told us.
Momo! Momo!
You can't know how happy I am
to see you!
Have a pear.
They're sweet.
Come!
Latifa, It's Momo!
Look how handsome he is!
What's new?
I was really worried.
Everyone said they sold you,
but I found out.
Wow, you look like a prince!
You've changed.
No doubt about it.
Did you bring something?
- No, it's for the family.
But I've got a deal for you.
Really?
- The insurance scam worked.
- See, it was a good idea.
I think we claimed too much,
but you'll get your cut.
Perfect.
Momo!
What is he doing with Ahmed?
Doesn't he know his family?
Put on some clothes!
Hurry up or she'll have a stroke.
Momo, my son!  Finally!
- What is that awful thing?
- It's not awful.
A little girl who knows Maurice
gave it to me.
- Did you give her anything?
- Yes, a beautiful doll.
Your Christmas present?
Yes, because she was poor.
Give me that dirty thing!
- No!
Coming swimming with us?
- No.  Are you going to the pool?
- No, in the river.
- In the river?
- Yeah, by the island.
NO SWIMMING
So you're Momo's older brother?
I'm his ex-sister, Roselyne.
The one everyone has...
How childish!
So, we're kind of related.
Mind if I take off my top?
Otherwise I get lines...
I'm surprised she's not
completely naked.
Funny I've never seen you in town.
Did you bring a swimsuit?
Oh, yes.
- Is it lager?
- Yeah.
- What's for lunch?
- BEER!
- Want one, Toc-Toc?
- Yeah.
Your skin is so smooth.
He's totally wasted.
Hey, Look over there!
ONE, TWO, THREEEE!
Yeahhh!
Paul, you're the oldest.  You know
your brother can't swim!
And Maurice, What were you thinking?
Jean,  Mathieu is hurt!
- It's nothing!
Are you a Doctor?
Breathe out!
Again!
Jean!
(He's drunk)
- Go to your room and take a bath.
- We just took one.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Don't you recognize me?
I'm Roselyne - Momo's ex-sister.
Yes, I recognize you, but
Maurice isn't here.
I didn't come for Maurice.
I came to see Paul.
I want to go to the cinema.
He's not here either.
That's okay.
I was just passing by.
Just tell him I was here.
Goodbye!
You're very well situated.
It faces directly South, no?
Bernadette, open the door!
It's Marie-Therese.
Here's your milk.
You're stupid, just like
your mother!
Hey, Your real Mother said "Hello".
That's not my family!
They're dumb, poor, and ugly!
Your mother's sad you're ill, but
you can move in with them.
They're making a room for you.
And your parents?
Did you think about them?
Marie-Therese,
you betrayed my trust.
How could spend the last five
months lying to me?
I saw your stomach was
getting bigger!
I swear I've never slept
with a boy.
Don't swear, Please!
But, madame...
You must have gone out with
a boy at least once.
I swear I never went out with a boy.
I never go out with boys.
Don't swear!
You must have gone to a
school dance.
No, I swear.
I've never been.
Stop swearing!
Maybe they got you drunk.
Don't shout!
I never drink.
Marie-Therese,
It's impossible.
Madam, I swear.
I'm expecting a baby.
I'm positive.
But I've never slept
with a boy.
Marie-Therese, Go home!
I have enough to worry about.
I don't need your lies.
Why were you shouting?
Maybe it's true.
- She's like the Virgin Mary.
- Enough!
Mother, I didn't mean to.
I'm very tired, Pierre.
This is all too much.
Then, learn to suffer.
God is testing us.
Christ also suffered.
Life is not a long steady river.
- What day is it?
- Five O'Clock.
Oh, you're so sweet.
More!
I'm exhausted.
Besides, it's not comfortable here.
I have twigs everywhere.
Too bad you don't have a car.
- And your father's car?
- I don't have a license.
So?
Nobody does.
More!
Okay, but just once more.
- Hi,  How is Bernadette?
- She went for a walk.
"For a walk"?
How?
Yes, she even took her backpack
and some food.
Ticket please.
I don't have a ticket.
- Where are your parents?
- I'm an orphan.
Is this your daughter?
- Yes.
They're not my parents.
She's tired.
Come on!
Come on, Bernadette!
The kitchen is filthy after
all your crêpes.
Watch out!
More!  More!
I've already made 34.
This is the last one.
Mom will be angry.
Crêpes are for Mardi Gras.
- That was fast.
- It's a miracle.
- I'm almost glad they found her.
- Be nice!
Bernadette is dirty.
- Who's gonna do the dishes?
- MARIE-THERESE!
What role does heredity play in a child?
Fr. Mendel responds in our debate.
Wait for me!
Paul!
Come here a minute!
- What are you doing?
- Going out.
- Going out?
- I'm 16.  I can go out.
What's got into you?
Did you ask your mother?
Let's see your wrists.
- What are those?
- Strength Bracelets.
- What for?
- Riding motorbikes.
And where is your motorbike?
I'll get a job and use my
savings to buy one.
- And the church trip?
- I'm not going.
- You're crazy!
- Shit, I'm 16!
- You can still be polite!
- I am polite.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Right!
Marielle, you're exhausted.
Go to the sea tomorrow
with Bernadette.
I'll bring the kids when they
finish school.
Marielle...You know,
You're very beautiful now.
You're giving me a hard-on!
Why are you bringing ski suits
to the beach?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Have you seen my Tootsie Rolls?
- What's wrong?
- I don't like it.  I want mother's.
It's the same thing.
- Think of those who are starving.
- They're lucky!
That's Enough!
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna make a ketchup sandwich.
- What now?
- They won't play with me.
- Where are your brothers?
- In the garage...
...sniffing glue.
Sniffing Glue!
What the Hell is This?
It's Monday.  It's ravioli!
There, Toc-Toc.
You don't need a hem.
Momo, do "the father"!
"You can drink now.
"If you drink cold after hot,
you'll hurt your teeth."
What a retard!
Is the mother worth a screw?
Is yours?
We're going to the sea for 1 month.
A month by the sea?
Damn, those bastards are rich!
Could we stay there next year?
But Touquet is chilly.
I'd rather go to the Riviera.
I promise next year,
you'll have your Riviera.
You're so sweet, Momo.
Oh, Dee-Dee got drunk!
I'm tired.
I'm going to bed.
We'll clean up tomorrow.
- Are you gonna sleep there?
- No, I'm going back.
Hey buddy!
Want some tea?
No, we leave early tomorrow.
Where to?
Touquet - My grandmother has a house.
- See you later!
- Bye, and enjoy your trip!
Touquet - My grandmother has a house.
Good night, dear.
Don't be sad!
A month's not long.
I won't bathe, so to keep your scent.
-  Where is your registration?
- At home.
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- Yeah.
- Hey, what are you doing out?
- I was visiting relatives.
- What's your name?
- Maurice Le Quesnoy-Groseille.
Serious?
Where do you live?
Avenue General Leclerc.
- Are you lost?
- No, I know the way.
Okay, but hurry home.
It's not safe here.
Yes.
Goodnight Officer!
Goodnight!
- Okay, punks.
Let's see some I.D.?
Que l'on touche à la liberté
Et Paris se met en colére
Et Paris commence à gronder
Et le lendemain
C'est la guerre
Paris se réveille
Et il ouvre ses prisons
Paris a la fíévre
ll la soigne à sa façon
ll faut voir les pavés sauter
Quand Paris se met en colére
Venez voir ses fusils rouillés
Qui clignent de l'oeil aux fenêtres
Sur les barricades
Qui jaillissent dans les rues
Chacun sa grenade
Son couteau ou ses mains nues
La vie, la mort ne comptent plus
On a gagné, on a perdu
Mais on pourra se présenter là-haut
Une fleur au chapeau
On veut être libre
À n'importe quel prix
Enfín vivre, vivre vivre
Vivre libre à Paris
Attention, ça va toujours loin
Quand Paris se met en colére
Quand Paris sonne le tocsin
Ça s'entend au bout de la Terre
Et le monde tremble
Quand Paris est en danger
Et le monde chante
Quand Paris s'est libéré
C'est la fête à la liberté
Et Paris n'est plus en colére
Et Paris peut aller danser
ll a retrouvé la lumiére
Aprés la tempête
Aprés la peur et le froid
Paris est en fête
Et Paris pleure de joie
