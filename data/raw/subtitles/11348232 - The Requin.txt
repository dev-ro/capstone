Hey, honey.
What are you doing up?
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
I don't like the bed.
Well, you better
get used to it,
it's only our first night here.
What about you?
Why are you up?
I couldn't sleep either.
Yeah.
Hey, you were gnawing your
teeth in your sleep again.
Had another episode.
Did you get connected
to the wifi?
No, nothing still,
I'm just looking at old posts.
Oh, I like that one there,
look.
"Has your husband even grieved?
Is he even around?"
Trolls.
Aren't they your friends?
From high school,
like half a lifetime ago.
So what now, they suddenly
all become your therapist?
I know it sounds so
stupid, but if you were
on social media,
you'd understand.
Well, I value my privacy.
It's funny how that makes
me into some kind of maniac.
Close.
You're in construction.
Well, I am a carpenter,
according to my old man.
Yeah.
I forgot, the religious
one in the family.
Listen,
I consider myself social,
just not in a media kind of way.
Do you want me to
go on social media?
I mean, would that help you?
Just forget about it.
I know who you are.
We're here for this.
What?
Just nothing.
Which is exactly
what we're gonna do
the whole time we're here.
We're just gonna
let go of everything.
Okay?
You promised me.
Just breathe.
Trust the harness.
Oh my god!
Too late now!
Woo!
Go, go, go, go!
Ah, go Jay!
Beautiful.
It's so pretty.
Excuse me.
Yes, may I help you?
Hi, was this a prison?
Yes, it is.
Would you like to
hear her story?
Yes.
Yes, please.
Her name was Vo Thi Sau.
She was famous
about her bravery.
At 14 years old, she took arms
against the French soldier.
Wow, a teenage war hero.
That's amazing.
Did she die here?
She was executed in 1952.
Her story is an
inspiration and make her
become a war hero in Vietnam.
It's like Joan of Arc.
Thank you.
For good fortune.
Hello, hello.
Honey?
Hi, Mom.
Hi!
Can you hear me?
Yes, I can hear you.
How are you guys doing?
We're doing great.
Where are you?
At a beachside cafe in town.
You want to see?
Yes, I want to see.
Oh my god.
Is that Kyle?
He's playing soccer
with the waiters.
Uh-huh, yes, baby, I see you.
Such a goof.
Don't they have a job to do?
Well, it's the off season.
There's not a lot of tourists
for them to take care of.
Oh, that's good.
You beat the crowd.
It looks beautiful.
It certainly is.
Good.
Look who's here,
look who went away.
Logan, come
over here, say hi!
Quiet no more.
Hi, Lizzie.
Hey, Sis.
How's Vietnam?
Oh, it's, it's amazing so far.
I went parasailing.
Twice.
Wait, you?
No way.
I know, well, they
offered us a free ride, so.
Oh, it's 'cause
you guys are a hot-ass couple.
That's right,
we are a hot-ass couple.
You guys have been
gone for three days.
I've been worried.
You said you would
call the first day.
I know, Mom.
There's no wifi in the room,
and it's really hard to get.
But did you get the
pictures that I sent you
just now of our hotel?
I did.
- Well, good.
- Wow, it's amazing.
Wait a minute, a
room above the water?
Is that safe?
Well, I hope, I guess.
It costs enough money.
No, why? Didn't you
say it's the low season?
Well, I still have
to watch my wallet.
I don't have a job
when I get home.
As a mother, I approve.
No woman should feel bad about
what you went through, baby.
Absolutely.
Hence, the amazing vacation.
Yeah.
I hope you realize how nice
it is of Kyle to do that?
I feel like most
guys would, you know,
go to happy hour and not plan
a whole vacation to Vietnam.
Yeah.
I was as surprised as you are.
I didn't see it coming.
Well, you guys need it.
It's never a bad decision
to take care of yourself,
or your marriage.
Wait, and no wifi?
I mean, for that price,
you guys should be getting,
at least HBO or something.
That's not the point, Lizzie,
it's a retreat for them.
Just them, by themselves.
I'll take you
here sometime, Mom,
and Lizzie,
it'll be a girls' trip.
Oh, god.
That sounds so good.
Your dad says hello.
He's on his fifth
day of no carbs.
- Really?
- He's horrible.
Now I just need to get
the beer away from him.
Good luck with that!
Yeah.
How are you guys doing?
How is Kyle doing?
He's good.
He's really good.
We're doing really well.
Good.
Honey, it'll be okay.
You need this.
I miss you.
Oh, I miss you too.
You know I love you.
I can't stand this.
Let's get off.
But you guys have fun out there.
Just forget about everything.
- Just...
- Yeah, that's-
That's what Kyle
keeps telling me.
Well, he needs you too, honey.
Come home to me soon, okay?
Get me something fun.
That'll be my
first order of business.
I love you.
Love you, Mom.
- Bye!
- I love you.
Bye, sweetie.
Bye.
Honey, there's no signal here.
That SIM you got
in town is useless.
Oh!
Oh my god, it's great.
I just, I'm trying to
get it on, I can't get on.
Look, I can see all the fish!
So clear.
Honey, honey, hey!
Come on, just get rid of it.
It's not what we're here for.
I just, I need a minute.
Come on.
Please, get in.
Let me help you,
you'll feel totally different.
Come on, we promised
we were just gonna
let go of everything, remember?
Besides, we paid a freakin'
fortune for this floating villa!
Come on.
All right.
Woo!
Hey, get me one too.
Got one.
No, no!
I hate you!
Don't!
I'm gonna get in!
God.
We should've done this sooner.
Ah, fuck, god damnit.
Honey.
I'm so sorry.
You know it's not your fault.
Honey, it's okay.
It's okay, it's not your fault.
It's gonna be okay.
It's okay.
You all right?
Mm-hmm.
It's just an episode.
Oh.
Sorry.
Maybe I shouldn't have
made you get in the water?
Just give me a minute.
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Kind of stings.
We should be wearing flippers.
You know, it's not your fault.
You know, none of it's
your fault, really.
I'm sorry it happened,
I'm really sorry.
You don't have
to blame yourself.
Shouldn't have done it.
He would have died either way.
It's not your fault.
Stop saying that.
I hate it when people
say that, especially you.
Sorry, I'm sorry.
God dammit, all that blood!
What?
Maybe she would have
lived if I hadn't bled.
Honey.
It's not true, come on.
It has nothing to do with
the water birth or the blood.
You came out of it alive.
We did everything we could.
We just, you hemorrhaged,
and then...
The baby didn't
have a heartbeat,
so, she didn't have a chance.
No, it was me!
That's it, I strangled her!
No.
I was being stupid,
I didn't take care of myself!
I wasn't being safe.
That's it.
We failed her.
I don't know, I just don't know.
Baby?
How, how, how, can we...
Nothing.
- Just...
- No.
I can't stay here.
Yeah, this trip, it's
not gonna work out, is it?
I can't control it, I don't
know why, it just happens.
No, no, don't, it's okay.
You don't have to
explain anything, honey.
I mean, from what I saw
today, from how you were,
we're not staying.
Thank you.
We can leave in the morning.
Maybe the hotel will
give us our money back.
Hey, you know, you
don't have to worry.
I mean you can start
posting tomorrow
how great our trip was.
Yeah.
You wanna go to the bar?
Are we gonna be okay?
I love you.
Here.
What was that?
Just the storm.
Should we be worried?
No, no, it's gonna pass
through, it's tropical.
Oh, it's tropical, yeah.
Just go back to sleep.
Hello?
Okay.
They say we can
relocate if we want.
What?
What'd she say about the storm?
That it's normal.
She's just calling
to reassure us.
Wow.
I don't think there's
anything to worry about.
I mean, how do you feel?
Um, well...
Should we move?
Okay.
No, we're okay, thank you.
Okay, good night.
You know, it's,
it's monsoon season.
I'm sure the hotel has
protocols and procedures
in place for this kind of thing.
Okay.
Kyle, wake up!
Oh my god.
Kyle.
Hey!
Oh, my leg.
I can't.
Get to the phone, call
someone.
Okay.
There's no dial tone.
Dammit.
It's dead. It's dead.
I think I broke my leg.
What? You broke your leg?
Honey?
Honey.
Honey.
Honey.
Honey, wake up!
Honey!
Talk to me.
Hey.
Honey?
Honey.
Talk to me!
Hey, talk to me!
Oh my god.
What?
What is it?
Kyle, we're moving
away from land.
Fuck!
Honey?
Are you okay?
God!
- God Dammit.
- Okay, okay.
Hello, is anyone there?
Do you see anyone?
Babe, I see someone, I think,
I think they're here for us.
Help!
Please, over here, we're here!
Help!
Please!
Help, over here!
Help!
Help!
- Hey!
- What?
We have to swim over to them,
we have to get off this thing.
- No.
- We're gonna lose them.
Do they even know that
we're still out here?
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
We gotta try.
- No.
- Listen.
I don't think we can make it.
It's gonna be okay,
we just have to try.
It's okay.
No, you can't
make it, your leg!
Listen, I'm fine, I'm
gonna be okay, all right?
We have to try.
We have to, baby.
We have to.
I can't do it!
Hey, trust me.
It's gonna be fine.
Hey, look.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
- Okay.
- Okay.
Here we go.
Careful.
Honey.
Come on, come on!
Jay!
Hold on, hold on.
I got you.
Hey!
Help!
Hey!
Kyle, I'm slipping!
Oh my god.
Come on!
Oh shit.
Honey, I love you.
Trust me.
Kyle, Kyle.
Kyle.
Kyle?
Kyle!
Hey, hey.
- Hey.
- Thank god.
You made it.
Okay.
Oh, you're bleeding.
Don't look at it.
Don't...
- Oh.
- Don't look.
Look.
What are we gonna do?
I think that we have
to wait this one out.
They'll come for us, right?
Maybe they'll wait
till the morning.
All we gotta do is we gotta
to stay afloat on this thing.
But that's not until tomorrow.
We can climb these rocks
and we'll send a signal,
the rescue crew has
gotta be around here.
The storm's too strong.
And I can't do that with my leg.
No, I'll do it.
No, I'll go.
No!
You saw how...
You saw me today on the reef.
You saw how risky it was.
I don't even know
how far away we are.
I mean, I can't even
see them anymore.
Listen, we have to stay put.
We're grounded, okay?
Okay.
They'll see us in the morning.
Okay.
What do I do about that?
You gotta get me a towel.
Okay.
Oh, okay, this?
Okay, okay, okay.
Right on it.
Yep.
- Is that good?
- Keep, keep pressure.
- It got worse.
- Yeah.
Yeah, when you were underwater,
I caught myself in that opening.
- Yeah.
- Here.
- Here, wrap that around it.
- Okay.
Okay, tie it tight.
Sorry.
That hurt more
than I thought I did.
Yeah.
Okay, let's get
you comfortable.
I'm getting a
discount on this room.
Oh my god.
Honey!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Honey, wake up!
Here, look, wake up.
Fuck.
We could be anywhere.
What are we gonna do?
I don't know.
No, we couldn't have
drifted that far.
We should've
gotten on the rock!
They were right there,
they could have seen us!
The storm was too strong,
we could have been killed.
I could have done it.
They were there,
the rescue was right there!
Honey, I understand.
I understand what you're saying.
It was too dangerous.
Maybe for you, but I
could have gone for us.
You were hanging off
the side of the house.
Do you remember going
underneath the house?
And who put me down there!
Jay, that's, that's ridiculous!
I can't believe it,
we always do it your way,
it's always your way!
Stop!
Stop it.
I need to focus.
Oh!
Fuck.
Here, just help,
move me away from the water.
I got it. I got it.
Okay.
Just give me a
second to breathe.
Okay.
Okay.
We need to keep
our heads about us.
We need to focus on surviving.
Okay?
Jay, honey.
We're still drifting.
Yeah, probably,
slowly, yeah.
We could be getting
further away by the minute.
It's true, but we could
also be headed back to land.
I just wanna try to get back.
Okay, okay.
I agree with you.
But I mean, where do we go,
which way do you want to swim?
Which direction would we go?
Let's just focus on surviving.
We have to get
everything we can use.
You just stay put.
I'll do it.
Honey, just gather what we need.
Look for water, blankets,
dry pillows, food.
I'll do it.
Okay?
Just gather things up.
Get anything you can.
Water!
More water!
Come on.
Ah.
Nice.
Yeah.
- Here.
- You go.
It's okay, you have it.
We'll have to conserve.
Phone.
Can you come pick up our bags?
- Honey?
- Mm-hmm.
What's wrong?
Swarm of fish scared
the shit out of me.
The shark bastards.
Oh.
You didn't happen to
catch one of them, did ya?
I could use a little sushi.
I was too scared
to think about sushi.
You know what, if it's
not yellowtail, forget it.
They'll come for us.
The raft is really big,
and it's very visible.
So, they'll see us.
We don't know where we are.
What if another storm comes?
How long can we
last in all this?
Alive now.
That's what matters.
So much for the
fancy water villa, huh?
You had to go fancy
and impress the wife.
I'm not impressed.
It only matters if I live
to tell someone about it.
Ow!
- What is it?
- Shit.
- Ah.
- What is it?
I just, I just got burnt.
- What?
- Yeah.
Ah.
You smell that?
Smells like burnt hair.
Yeah.
Burnt the hair on the
inside of my thigh.
What the hell!
Yeah, just scorched my balls.
Well, you gotta
keep it near you.
Just want to keep
it off my nuts.
Here.
You want it on my thigh now?
Wake up.
Hey, over here!
Hey!
Hey, over here!
Over here!
Hey!
Over here!
- They're too far away.
- Huh?
Too far away.
We have to try.
If I can see them,
they can see us!
- Smoke.
- What?
- Smoke.
- The bottle.
- The bottle, yes.
- Yeah.
Is that enough water?
Just drink it baby,
you need it.
C'mon, drink it up.
I'm gonna fill it
up with salt water.
Come on.
Yes, okay.
Okay, here, do it, come on.
I just need something.
Find dry things, dry
things, anything dry.
Here's paper.
Okay.
- No, it's too wet.
- Too wet.
All right.
What?
Do it!
- No.
- Hurry.
Fuck.
- Oh, fuck.
- What?
The sun's too low.
- No!
- It's too low.
- Try it again!
- The sun's too low.
No!
- Do it, honey, go, try again!
- It's too low.
Oh, god.
Hey!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Please.
We're right here.
They're gone, they're gone.
Honey, honey.
Honey.
Come on, come here.
Drink this.
Please drink this.
There's not much,
but just drink it.
Kyle.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Over here!
Over here!
Over here.
Over here!
Honey.
- Use the newspaper.
- Ok, yeah.
Oh, baby.
The newspaper, yes.
- No, like-
- You got it?
- I got it.
- Okay.
Over here!
Over here!
Over here!
Over here!
Over here!
Over here!
Over here!
Over here!
- Over here.
- Hey.
There's smoke.
It's working,
it's working, it's working.
Get it.
No!
No!
They're going away!
Baby, more!
More!
More, more, everything.
Just put everything on them now!
We're going to lose them.
They're gonna see us,
they're gonna see.
Help!
Fuck.
Hey, honey.
No.
Jay!
Get outta here!
Fuck!
Come out, come out.
Come out.
Get outta there.
What was that?
What?
I just saw something jump up.
There it is again.
I think maybe it's
just the current.
No, it's a shark.
It's a shark.
Your leg, the blood!
Let me, let me check, okay?
The blood!
Shark, I see it, I see it.
Okay, we have to
get out of the water.
Wait, over there there's
a board, can you make it?
- Come on.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Come on!
Come on.
Swim, baby.
Hurry, hurry.
I saw it!
Okay.
Hurry.
Come on.
We have to get to that raft.
Just stay still,
I'm gonna paddle.
I gotta get my leg
out of the water.
Oh, your leg.
Gotta stay on.
Sharks.
Oh my god.
We have to get to that raft!
Stay still, baby,
I'm gonna paddle us over.
Okay.
Okay.
Come here, come here.
The other way.
Come on.
I fuckin' hate dolphins.
Ow, ow.
It'll be here if you need it.
This is it for us, isn't it?
No one's coming.
You know, people
survive for months at sea.
They only say that 'cause
they live to tell it.
Well, this is not our fate.
So.
We're gonna make it.
Just like, just like
all the other times.
I'm sorry, I can't.
You hate apologies, remember?
I dragged us into this hell.
We would never have been here
if it wasn't for my dread.
No.
I could have done things better.
I just, I could have been
more patient with your PTSD.
And I shouldn't have left
you alone in your misery.
I never should've
mentioned divorce.
I just, I could've
done it better.
I could've wanted,
but it doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Because we brought
each other out here.
Maybe this is our fate.
Childless and die young.
It's kinda cool,
it's like a rockstar fate.
There's gonna be
concerts in your name.
Fuckin' Flotel.
We're like the unluckiest
couple in the world.
Oh, honey.
- Careful.
- We're not gonna...
Listen to me.
We're not gonna die.
We're not gonna die.
Do you remember Carl's wedding?
And I saw you a week
later at that dog park.
You had that, that Pitbull.
He was so cute.
You had that
ridiculous picture.
Oh.
We're gonna be okay.
Okay?
I don't want you to worry.
We're gonna be fine.
We're gonna make it.
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.
- Yeah?
- You know that?
You're like my best friend.
My wife.
You're more than I'll ever have.
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay, baby.
You promise?
I promise.
I promise.
Baby?
Honey, are you okay?
Oh, fuck you!
Kyle!
Kyle.
Kyle!
You have to get
out of the water!
You have to get
out of the water!
It's okay, I can't move, okay?
Just go!
Go, paddle, go, get your paddle!
Hurry, hurry, oh god!
Oh god!
Honey, honey.
Honey, wake up!
There's land.
There's land, baby!
No, baby!
No.
No.
Come on.
Wake up.
Come on, baby, wake up!
Wake up, c'mon!
Wake up!
I'm gonna wake you up.
You're gonna wake up now, okay?
You're gonna wake up now!
You're gonna wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Wake up now!
You have to wake up.
Wake up, come on.
I need you.
Don't leave me!
I love you.
My best friend.
Kyle.
Kyle.
Live.
How?
Do you remember the feeling
of the baby inside you?
I do.
Yeah.
The same life is inside you now.
I need you.
I'm right here.
You're with me?
Wake up, please!
Please!
Please wake up!
Help me.
Please help me.
Help me, please.
Look, my leg.
My leg!
Look, a shark.
A shark bit me.
It's so bad.
Shark and...
Water, yeah.
I was out there in the
ocean, my husband died.
Please, can you take me home?
Can you take me home?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, it's bad.
Oh, you wanna look at it?
Oh.
Ow.
Okay, okay.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay?
Oh.
- Okay.
- Okay.
Yeah, do it.
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Okay, okay.
Sir?
Sir, where are you?
Sir?
Sir?
Sir?
There, there's sharks!
The sharks are near!
Sharks!
Sir, get out!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Sir!
Give me your arm!
Come on, use your
feet, use your feet.
That's right, mother fucker.
Not today.
That's okay.
You want more?
Do you want more?
Fuck you.
I'll give you more.
Dammit.
Fuck.
Why now?
Dammit!
Fuck!
Where'd you go, where'd you go?
Where'd you go?
What the fuck?
What the fuck?
