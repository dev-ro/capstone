THE CITY OF WOMEN
With MarceIIo again?
Maestro, pIease...
Super buns!
You're stupendous
Gorgeous!
The woman I've aIways...
God, you're just too much!
Are you married?
Twice divorced. Why?
Oh, couIdn't your husbands satisfy you?
Can you?
I'd be ready in a minute
We'II see...
Just keep stiII
You want to do it here?
What a chest you've got! Come here
We can aIways try
Where are we?
Fregene... It's my station!
- Wait. What's your phone number?
- Good-bye!
She's not getting away
Where's that mount going?
Signora, the station's over there
What'II I do?
Let her go?
Look at that gait!
Good OIe Snaporaz can't Iet that go!
Signora!
HoId on a minute!
Taking pictures?
Take a shot of my pecker
CarefuI, or I'II get you
between two watermeIons
You gorgeous cow
That was some kiss!
Like a shoveI
You need a taste of OIe Snaporaz.
Signora!
No, wait! Stop! Wait for me!
And now what...?
AIas, 'tis a divinity that guides us,
OIe Snaporaz
Where're you taking that ass?
Here I am!
Signora...
There's an important matter
My train...
Where's that mare?
There she is!
Wait, what's the hurry?
SIow down.
Before you were so sweet, and now
- you're going away!
- Not going away, going towards
Going towards what?
Do you Iive here?
Ah, what a wonderfuI smeII!
These trees use finer perfumes
than your pIaymates
Are You married?
No. That is, yes. OnIy once.
But I have no
''pIaymates''
We're aIone: you and I...
Can't you sIow down?
Why the cross-country race?
Stop
Why do you foIIow?
What if I were going to meet a man?
Or many men...strong men?
It's a pity you Iost
your train for no reason
You're not afraid?
A IittIe.
But that excites me aII the more
Give me a kiss, just one
Like you did before
Let me say it: you're a hot bitch!
You'd take on an army.
What an ass!
It drives me crazy.
Where's that kiss?
Not that kiss.
Want a reaI one?
Quick...
Want me to eat you aIive?
Here? One condition...
If you cIose your eyes
I'II give you a tremendous kiss!
No, be stiII.
And keep your eyes cIosed!
Where'd she go?
No good bitch
With aII my troubIes I have to go...
and make a fooI of myseIf
Who knows why I carry on
Iike a siIIy boy?
At my age!
Now I'm stranded without provisions
in a godforsaken forest
OIe Snaporaz
I dunno, boss
One and two! Two and three!
Three and four!
Four and five!
Five hundred!
Five thousand!
Five hundred thousand!
Five miIIion...
Five hundred miIIion women!
Remove the furniture.
It's rigid, obtuse
It's mascuIine!
Don't accept caIIs.
Ladies, be reasonabIe, one at a time!
How come coupIes get rooms
without identification?
There's my big bunny, honey-woney
You Iove me, don't you?
WeII?
Nothing
HeIIo. Nice convention, huh?
Are you from the newspaper?
It's a wonder you got in.
I'm from the newspaper too
I even wrote about our Convention
in Heinzburgend
Have you been there?
''Nein'', no men were there
Who can repair a tape recorder?
Nobody?
Can somebody fix a tape recorder?
Excuse me, sir...
Did a Iady...
A femaIe Iady?
What a stupid question,
that's aII we've got
Keep your cooI.
She has boots and a Russian hat
He just waIked in.
He's right in front of me
Where are they going to practice
group meditation?
OnIy one room?
Too many waves...
Come on, you.
My recorder broke down
Everything's made of pIastic
Ah, it's working?
You've just heard
typicaI mascuIine sounds
UnbearabIe.
They onIy suggest aggressiveness
There she is!
Out with the shit, Morning gIory!
Now you'II hear
deIicate and harmonious sounds
GentIe and friendIy
Humane, feminine sounds
Sounds of Iacerated siIks
Women working at their own pace
Here we have the turtIe position
Practice this position
for psychic stabiIity
Hey, you...
You don't beIong here
Go whiIe the going's good
TaIking to me?
What do you mean?
There she is...Signora!
I'm here!
The vagina is a sheII
with the sound of the sea
You aII recaII the song of the siren
But the maIe offends her
with humiIiating names:
snatch, box, bunny
Beaver!
Patootie!
Let us expIore this vagina of ours
with her Iips, eternaIIy kissing
Let's find new names
Tongue of Iight! SmiIe of Iife!
Moon-vioIet
The statues of Ancient Greece
have phaIIuses
that rise up haughtiIy
Look at what phaIIuses have inspired
Where can you get that?
WishfuI thinking
And so, phaIIic power
keeps oppressing haIf of humanity
That is, we women!
Even the missionary position
is sociaIIy obsoIete
What does he do?
The man, arrogant, with member erect
on top of the woman with
her passive vagina
A sociocuIturaI oppression,
from patriarchaI times
to the present day
We're against penetration.
It's invasion without defense!
We want IdeaI Coitus with parity
between MaIe and FemaIe
Penetration is a crime that shouId
carry a fine of 10 miIIion Iira!
The Feminist Movement
at CoIumbia University
-has been doing extensive research
- They're reactionaries!
Fascists!
Stop right there. I've had it!
You've busted my ovaries!
Let go!
Our main goaI is to aboIish feIIatio!
A degrading practice from which
we have never been weaned
I Iike feIIatio
What's this feIIatio?
Try reading CatuIIus!
It's onIy a subconscious manifestation
of women's creativeness
Oh, finaIIy...
The kitchen's far off
I'II take the tray.
Go on, scram. Beat it
Cas-tra-tion! Cas-tra-tion...
The American woman
prefers the foIIowing position,
and naturaIIy their husbands compIy!
Why must it be a man and a woman?
There's no need for a man
Mas-tur-ba-tion! Mas-tur-ba-tion!
We've a thousand sensations
in the paIm
of our hand, in our armpit...
We must defeat feIIatio,
it's primitive!
Tahitian women have Iearned to keep
a turgid organ in their vagina
for a whoIe night!
A feat unknown to us!
FinaIIy I see two smiIing faces
among so many scowIing women.
Why so bitter?
Yes, I understand feminism
but is the anger necessary?
The usuaI maIe commentary, huh?
Virgin yet whore,
angeIic yet diaboIicaI
Goddess of the hearth
and instrument of pIeasure
Two aspects of faIse femininity
to better serve
the maIe chauvinist pig!
''The Average Housewife''
Oh no, you're crying?
Marriage-Miscarriage!
Thank you, you were both marveIous
Marriage-Miscarriage... yes, exceIIent!
I agree
You're absoIuteIy right
Yes, certainIy!
There is Mrs. SmaII
jogging
in front of six husbands
AII happy and content
Rare exampIe of feminism
inside the famiIy circIe
We're very Iucky
to obtain an interview
in her house
She says that when
she was a IittIe baby
the story of Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs
made a great impression on her
Iike a premonition of
what her future wouId be
Her husbands
are of different nationaIities
One is even ItaIian, from NapIes
She went there to buy a dog
but ended up marrying him!
Here is a finaI toast
with aII the husbands
One moment! There's a big surprise
Our vaIorous comrade,
Enderbreith SmaII
who was in my fiIm
is here with us
You can ask questions to her
Aren't you a sIave to 6 masters?
That's my question too!
Is she happy in her
poIyandric reIationship?
She said very happy.
It's a united famiIy
Now I'II ask where her husbands are
Hans, Jenz, Jan, Giggi, Lars, Peter!
ALL WOMEN ARE BEAUTIFUL
Go on, go on...keep going
Don't stop
My dear sisters, I'm sixty
OnIy sixty!
Menopause doesn't exist
It's an aIibi for the MaIe Society
It's he, the maIe,
who runs out of steam!
I spent my Iife teaching chiIdren
And I found teaching them
more rewarding
than having them
Look at this beautifuI Ieg,
see any seams or veins?
WrinkIes are a maIe invention!
My husband said:
''You're Iike cIimbing the Everest
- without oxygen!''
- I'm proud of my wrinkIes!
Here they are, one by one
I've no fear of aging nor of dying
I adore Iife.
Making Iove is marveIous
AII women are young!
AII women are beautifuI!
They're aII onIy twenty years oId!
A woman without a man
Is...
She's Iike a nose without a room
A somersauIt without any chowder
Like a dictionary without a broom
A parasoI without any powder
A woman without a man is...
A paIisade without a strut
A paIimpsest without a sting
A pachyderm without a putt
A paraboIa without a sIing
A woman without a man is...
A periscope without any greens
A pinnacIe without a sigh
A pimperneI without any means
A pedigree without a thigh
I'd Iike to say something
though it may be useIess, sisters
We've been deceived once again
Very subtIy. True to his styIe
We were generous and hospitabIe
Understanding. We spoke
We discussed. We sang
We performed our rites
without reserve,
or feminine modesty
in the futiIe hope of making known
to one who cannot,
nor wishes to know
how much freedom,
how much authenticity
and Iove, and Iife
has been denied us
Our efforts here have been useIess,
sisters
The eyes of that man,
presentIy among us with that Iook
of feigned respectabiIity, of one
who desires to know us, understand us
because he insists that it can
better our reIationship
And of aII of his hypocriticaI excuses,
this is sureIy the basest
Those eyes are the eyes of the maIe
we've aIways known
They refIect his inner derision,
his mockery
He has the same rotten core
We are onIy a pretext
for another of his crude,
animaIistic fabIes
Another neurotic song-and-dance act
We're his chorus,
his huIa girIs, his fiends
We enhance his show with our passion
with our suffering
I warn this dismaI, hoIIow,
worn-out SuItan
that we're neither
marionettes nor fiends
We're of this earth
but not as mere compost,
as he wouId have us
He doesn't know us, nor wants to
and that is his fataI error
WhiIe we've been shut up in his harem
or isoIated in our respective ghettos
we've had the time to study him
To observe this keeper of ours
Our Lord!
We know you weII!
Everything about you.
You're the marionette, the fiend!
Look at him!
He hides
You can't hide!
Your number is up
Look, I'II teII them everything,
about the train and how you...
Look sisters!
In cIose-up!
Go to heII!
Attention!
A maIe
Iurks among us,
and Iistens to what we say
He steaIs our words.
He records them
onIy to deform their meaning
He's a spy
We must stop him. Find him
Corner him. Throw him out
Excuse me...
Over there. That's him!
Out! Out! Out!
Ladies, pIease...
I came here by chance
Let me speak
Sir...
Come, foIIow me
What manners! You're aII mad!
How was I supposed to know
you were hoIding a convention?
Why pick on me?
What's so funny?
Why'd you caII me? Let me out
Where are you going?
I wouIdn't Iet him out
What does he want from us?
Instead I feeI Iike heIping him.
I'm very maternaI
I can't heIp it
It's my big weakness.
Can you skate?
Skate? As a kid...
You've a chance then.
Give him your skates
You must be brave and above aII, Iucky
- Are you Iucky? - For what? Skating?
Where are we going?
That's GabrieIIa, every day,
she circIes the rink 300 times
She made a vow
Why don't we teII them
you're the new instructor?
He'II end up
Iike the pIumber did
It'd be a pity
That thing's upstairs
Be carefuI when you open it
- Come, put the skates on
- Where's the exit?
- You said you'd heIp me get out
- In front of you
They're good, huh?
Must you go?
- How oId are you? - Too oId
Strike here,
the maIe genitaI organs
You missed. You aII miss!
You Iack concentration
Concentration is everything
Keep mind on objective
Come, CamiIIa
Legs wide apart...
I got first prize for the
best kick in the testicIes
- It's bothersome, isn't it?
- Oh no, it's a joy
Why are you here?
Strange, isn't it?
I'm a chick fuII of contradictions
Ready for ''Mackarij'' kick... Go!
Good kick!
Because good concentration
In your imaginative sphere
you must visuaIize the genitaIs
Are you trying to rescue him,
DonateIIa?
Lots of Iuck!
Come, grandpa
HoId on.
It's thirty years since I've...
Don't be so nervous
I have a trick knee
You'II Iead me to the exit,
won't you?
You're such a dear...
Don't puII, I'II faII
Let go! I don't need you
Afraid, huh?
How beautifuI!
They're good. Very choreographic
ShaII I come and get you?
It's a madhouse!
Hurry, you fooI!
- Come, Daddy...
- A bunch of nitwits!
- Stop them! - They can't stop
We have to get through.
Let us through!
Look out! There's a stair !
There's a stair...
The steps are sIippery
You sIip Iike an eeI
My husband kept sIipping
untiI he was kaputt
Come, IittIe one...
Breathe together with me
Breathe and count: ''Eins''...
Does it hurt?
Of course it does!
Cunts!
Look what a nice bronco!
I get such ideas...
I have to get back.
Where's the station?
Station?
I'II take you
But ''nicht so schneII'', young feIIa
I can't make out what she says!
I won't touch you because
I'II dirty you more
Good boy...
Take your IittIe coat and scarf
You see how bIack I am?
A bucket of water and I'm aII white.
Like a sIice of bread
''Schon besser''? FeeI better?
Let's go then. Move, young feIIa
Who'II ever beIieve this?
If that bitch up there hadn't...
What time is it? Who knows?
Listen...
''And with his dipper
He skimmed the pot
''Skim, skim, skim
''And now I scrub-scrub''
Where's the station?
Makes hot bubbIes inside...
You men are so strange
You're aII IittIe cubs
You're a young feIIa too, a cub
''They aII got fever-fever
For my beaver-beaver
''CooI it, water, cooI it, cooI it''
''The same rotten core''
Oh, reaIIy, Madame?
''He hasn't changed a bit...''
Why shouId he change?
To become what, instead?
I'm aII yours...
Come, IittIe cub. I'm ready
With my motorcycIe
we'II aII be at the station in 10 minutes
Are you afraid?
I'm harmIess
Except for one thing...
Just kidding.
Don't be afraid for your thing
HoId on
HoId on tight. Tighter, tighter!
Signora, I took a different road
this morning. There was no canaI!
It's a short cut
Do you hear the frogs?
- They're singing
- So who gives a damn?
How much Ionger wiII it take?
AImost there
We'II stop here
For just...sec-sec
What for?
The Stationmaster, poor thing
Signora, where're you going?
The Stationmaster's seeds.
I promised him
This is too much!
Come, heIp me
Had I known...
CIever, Weisenheimer.
You want everything easy
HeIp her how?
''There was a beaver who thought
not of her beaver, poor thing
''She takes him to the station,
but he denies her
''a heIping hand for a few seeds''
This is ridicuIous!
''Come, come,
we'II gather seeds for aII our needs''
It'II onIy take a second
Duck that nice head of yours
- What beautifuI hair...
- Yeah, thanks
These stuffed cats beIong
to my granddaughters
It's hot in here, huh?
Want a fresh egg?
They're good for you
Puts Iead in your penciI
Don't waste time, get the seeds
and Iet's go
It's not time for seeds, siIIy cub
Look at this titty
Ever seen one so nice?
Oh, this is too much!
Signora, cover up...
Squeeze it for a sec then we'II go.
You know nothing about me
Don't say no. Touch it with a finger
just for a sec-sec
It's nice and firm
Yeah, it's firm,
but Iet's go to the station
I've a cat down there that's purring
- And moaning - That's your business!
She's meowing. Come and stroke her
My big cat!
Take me to the station!
Are you crazy?
Let go!
I need it. Where are you?
Feed the cat. Feed it!
Don't obIige me to use force
My God, how it stinks!
HeIp! HeIp!
Gimme your IittIe ''knockwurst'',
gimme gimme!
You pig!
You sow!
It's my mother...
Mama, I onIy came here to get
some seeds
Seeds for the Stationmaster.
The gentIeman here
was heIping...
You monster! Come out!
How couId I give birth
to such a monster?
Look what she did to you
I apoIogize on my knees
for that fiIthy gaIoshe
That barge!
Out! Come out!
I'II come out, but no kicking,
Mama. Swear!
You oId toad!
You swore...
you'II go to heII for that
Go home!
Shame!
She didn't do anything, reaIIy
I asked for some seeds
I'II fix her! Sweetie...
Accompany the gentIeman
To the train station.
And make sure you take the River Road
Forgive us
We're poor peopIe. Long Iive ItaIy!
Yeah, Iong Iive
Wait! My coat...
Is it far?
They'II meet us
Who wiII?
Trudge, trudge
The road wiII never budge
Where's Schizo?
She's going cIean
She couId be anywhere
- Who's that?
- We're takin' him to the station
The car's aIready a bit overIoaded
She's not comin'...doesn't feeI good
Ugh...it's rippin' my guts
Can't breathe
What's she got?
Where'II I sit?
What are you doin',
sittin' on the bottIe with that ass...
Mommy struck again!
She screwed him...
She's something eIse!
Good-bye, Snow White
No, no way
''You turn me off'', he says
What? I turn you off?''
Then he says,
''I can't score with you''
''You're wiped out,
it's vice versa'', I say
He bIows my mind, I swear
They're comin'!
- Pussy ahead!
- The San Vincenzo junkies!
She borrowed the car again.
She's far out!
Put on some sound
What are you doing, you jerk?
Look out! Stop!
Who was that idiot?
Hey, how's Big Red makin' out?
He's stiII makin' out
Ciao, Iove...ciao, Iove
Ciao, Iover...
Don't be ridicuIous
You know what I got here?
You don't know what I got
ReIax...
There's nothing better to do
Come on, dance
The pIane!
What are you doing?
You're going backwards?
Stop!
Let go!
AsshoIe! Gimme back my gun
Monsters! You're aII monsters!
DiaboIicaI!
What are you?
Who's that jerk?
WeII?
You think you can scare me?
What fiIm is this?
Stop running, my good man!
ItaIo, Franz, CIeo...come!
Be good!
Enter...
I'II cover your retreat
from those ''Iesbos''
How can femaIe creatures
stoop so Iow?
They're bIanks, unfortunateIy
OnIy good for scaring them
It's three nights they keep me awake
with their shouting
their sit-ins
their Lesbo raIIies
AIthough I'm busy with other
matters at night!
But just knowing that they're
camped down outside my house,
makes me furious
Come... No, wait
Let me see your face
OId pines faII down Iike this
HoIIowed out.
It was a hundred years oId
It toppIed without warning
- But we'II never faII - NaturaIIy...
You'II turn into repuIsive oId hags
before you'II see me toppIe!
Come in...
Thank you
Drugged,
teenage girIs tried to run me over
TypicaI
It's criminaI, reaIIy
Have no fear.
You're safe in my house
Come
And don't worry about my puppies
You Iike weapons?
They're my passion
Guns, women, horses. Women first!
And women Iast too...
There's few of us Ieft ever
since the Invasion
Have you heard? They've threatened
to demoIish my house
Drink...
Look what they did to you!
Want some cIean cIothes?
No, I'II be going. They were
supposed to take me to the station
- I'm sorry, we haven't met
- Züberkock, Dr. Züberkock
Snaporaz, my pIeasure
Sit down
By chance...
Weren't we schooImates?
Wasn't it you...
I'd swear you were the one...
who couId tie his dong
at rest position
At rest?
It wasn't me
Turn that Iight on
Your father had a white
streak of hair?
He was baId
Good answer. I'm happy you're here
This one?
Amazing...
- May I? - With your ear
Go on
It cost me a fortune
At a pubIic auction,
I had to outbid
a Jamaican miIIionaire.
It's better than Etruscan vases
or Egyptian pots!
I've the finest ''objets d'art''
of the Orient and Europe
that honor the women and Iove!
You do Iove d'Annunzio?
Of course! Pardon,
is the station nearby?
I dreamt of him. He said:
''Xavier...''
''Remember the greenhouses!''
What greenhouses?
Quiet!
You shaII see, my friend
the spIendor of my greenhouses
The most beautifuI orchids
in the worId
with petaIs Iike fIesh
It sounded Iike their patroI cycIe
They come and go. AIways checking!
Day and night!
Goddamn them!
What's this?
Ah, you remember!
I invented it whiIe stiII in schooI.
But the Japanese stoIe my idea
TypicaI
Automatic vibrators, 3000 r.p.m.
With this the woman goes crazy
She screeches Iike an eagIe
It's paradise for her
Be stiII!
Let's see if you have the courage!
Come on!
I'd Iove to see you fry on
the high-tension wires!
Or better stiII,
impaIed on the spires of the main gate
UnfortunateIy,
I had them designed Iike phaIIuses
Grave mistake!
Yes...
My heart breaks when I think that
my house, over 50 years oId
aImost buiIt with my own hands
and baptized ''My TempIe''
must be demoIished
Dem-o-Ii-tion!
Dem-o-Ii-tion!
Dem-o-Ii-tion...Bitches!
Why demoIition?
Laws decreed by our new ruIers
Those hoodIum ''Iesbos''
They want a sick worId
But they don't know me. I shoot!
I have guns, dogs, high-tension.
And faithfuI friends
Yes, but I must...
I have a fortress here!
By HercuIes, I must dress...
for the party. Wait here
I can't stay...
I'II drive you back tomorrow,
wherever you Iike
You have to see my orchids
3000 r.p.m.
How the heII does it stop?
WiII you stop!
Idiot! You're gaining speed!
Quiet! CooI it
''Mother''
Let me dig him out
Find him with my own hands
Oh good God, what have you here?
What is it?
Let me dig him out
Find him with...
Turn around how?
Like this? Is this good?
But I'II faII!
Ah, Iike that...Iike that!
Oh, yes, yes...
No...too much
That's enough
I beg you
Stop...stop
No, no, no...more! more! more!
You had enough orgasm.
Now I want orgasm
A 15 minute orgasm
I want orgasm twice.
To ''orgasm'' or ''orgasimize''?
To come
You had enough orgasm.
Now I want orgasm...
Who are you?
Let's try here
I'II eat him!
Don't think so?
Your turn!
Oh, Mommy...
Mummy... Mother...
She was UIa BuIa.
She sang when she Ioved
StiII more!
Look how many!
My dear friend,
you're reaIIy extraordinary
How did you manage?
Want to hear them aII together?
The dear Iadies?
EIena! You, in here?
Aren't you?
My train was stuck in the country
I wanted to phone
- I'd have caIIed anyway
- I was out
How come?
Isban Isbarashi!
Let us begin
We cannot disappoint
our faithfuI friends
BeautifuI Iady,
join the ceIebration
for my ten thousandth conquest
Everyone's waiting
Come...
You too, dear Snaporaz
Best wishes, Dr. Züberkock
You find her beautifuI?
Wait, my friends,
before appIauding
My sweet fiancée
wouId Iike to perform
something for you
Concentration...
ImpossibIe
Don't upset him
I'd do it for you,
but I don't know how
- Do what? - You'II see
Music
Where wiII these
goId pieces end up?
An OrientaI art practiced
by many courtesans
It's Zen-Sex
Want to try?
Another one
SiIence
Give me your neckIace
She does it with pearIs too!
Are you happy? Happy now?
Ten thousand candIes.
I wiII try
AII of them!
How about those?
Is he mad?
Swine!
No, it's not what you think!
Look here my friends
It was champagne!

Friends...
Amidst aII this merrymaking,
I feeI great sadness
'tis a bitter cake
Because you pissed on it,
you sIob!
It's not that...
Then why?
Because it's time to say
fareweII to women
AII women
To the woman of the poet
The true woman
To my woman
At Ieast teII me...
OnIy you can go to parties?
This Iady aIso Iikes
to enjoy her Iiberty!
Thanks for showing me how!
Let's go away
I get depressed at home
I ran into my singing teacher
Excuse me, sir,
but I'm taIking to my psychoanaIyst
Go right ahead, I'm not...
What are you doing here?
You vagabond!
Loredana
Look who's here!
Your button's coming Ioose
Come, I'II fix it
I'II be right here, EIena!
I keep everything in here
So I see
You're sweet, you remind me...
It's incredibIe
You're the spitting image
of a showgirI who...
I'm her daughter
- She was my mother
- There were two very pretty...
Yes, my aunt
The Smash Duo
The Smash Duo! What memories!
And you're a feminist?
NaturaIIy
How couId I not be?
Why do you come here?
That's a secret
You got yourseIf into a mess
I feeI better. Want to taIk?
No, thanks anyway
TeII me... Why am I in a mess?
Adieu woman!
Oh, what war, what peace,
what Iand, what sea,
you were for me
Water and fire, aII is desire
And when I pray
'tis you I impIore
Adieu...
Eyes so imperious
Knees so mysterious
To you, I say adieu!
Adieu...
Oh naveI so compeIIing
You were the dweIIing
of my dying Iips
Yes, I'm drinking.
My fifth. Or sixth or tenth
I don't know but
I've no intention of stopping
What a bore you are
And yet your friends
consider you witty
One who sees the
brighter side of Iife
But did you ever force yourseIf
to make me smiIe?
To make me a part of things,
as a true friend?
Never!
It wouIdn't hurt to try,
at Ieast once,
before everything turns to shit!
But he's too busy
with crossword puzzIes
and mystery stories,
with his waistIine,
his homeopathic cures,
acupuncture...
Maybe a IittIe puncture down there
wouId do you good, huh?
How considerate you are
Listen, EIena, don't you...
Oh, sorry...
Remember when you used to pIace
IittIe notes under my piIIow?
Did you Iove me then?
Did you?
Answer me!
Why do I even bother asking?
You never Iisten to me
He never once Iistened to me!
He's mum
Look at him
He won't taIk
You shouIdn't taIk
when you're Iike this!
Do you reaIize how empty
my Iife is?
Has it ever dawned on you?
Was I ever abIe to taIk about me
without you making a face
or fidgeting?
What important exchange have
we had in aII these years?
None
Never!
Never anything!
OnIy when you're far away,
do you feeI the need to caII up,
and chat
I'm your refuge
But I wasn't made for that!
I'm sorry, it's not enough!
You had your mother for that.
I'm not your mother!
Quiet...
Must you do this to me?
CaIm down, pIease
It's not as bad as you make it
You're exaggerating.
We haven't come to such odds
We've been through
difficuIt moments before
We'II grow oId together
I won't Ieave you
You won't?
But I wiII!
AsshoIe
Grow oId with you?
To be your nursemaid?
Tend to aII your iIIs?
CIean your bedpans,
and put up with your whims?
There's a fountain...
you'II faII in!
I'm better off aIone
Do you know what
you've turned me into? I'm a nonentity
Do I stiII exist?
Go on, say it
that I don't exist
Don't you think I worry
about our situation?
About shedding some Iight?
Let's not torture each other
Shed some Iight?
He wants to ''shed Iight''
Then Iet's shed, sir
Shed away!
SiIIy, you don't know how to do it
There may stiII be a chance,
if you wanted
Or are we too oId
to be young again, you and I?
The poIice! PoIice!
Wake up, Krisha. The poIice!
- Your Residence Permit?
- A new goriIIa?
Though my hearts brims
with desire, I say...
Adieu!
Good evening, one and aII!
Dr. Züberkock, my respects
Forgive me for interrupting
Iike this
but the owner of the house,
iIIegaIIy buiIt
and subject to demoIition,
is aware, correct me otherwise,
that aII parties
must terminate at 1 1 .30 p.m.
You've onIy a few minutes Ieft
My beautifuI Inspector,
your presence does honor my house
May I...?
At 8 am tomorrow
you wiII report to Lt. Myrna
She wants to know why you fired upon
innocent schooIgirIs this morning
LittIe cub! Identification, pIease!
What the...?
You're a poIicewoman?
I shot in the air
I have witnesses
You're a IittIe soft
What's this I feeI
that wriggIes Iike an eeI?
It's Iimp. It hangs at 6.30
EIena! My Iove!
Francesca!
DarIing
I'II dress myseIf!
Now I make a report:
Why are you here?
And when wiII you go away?
Another motorcycIe ride?
You're guiIty
of mistreating minors
but thanks to EIena,
we'II not arrest you
They were minors?
I'm guiIty of having mistreated
poor IittIe girIs?
Yes, IittIe girIs!
What have I signed,
sweet enchantress?
The report concerning your dog's
aggressiveness and subsequent death
Dr. Züberkock, you know very weII
you can't keep dogs Iike that
without speciaI permission
One attacked a guard,
and was kiIIed
Ladies...
Our humbIe respects
I'm sorry,
but the Stationmaster is better than you
They kiIIed ItaIo!
The dog I Ioved most
Whores! Murderers!
Three of you for every dog kiIIed!
ItaIo...
What harm did he ever do,
this faithfuI friend?
What's happening tonight,
anyway?
I feeI storms in my beIIy
Love is beautifuI
when it's storming
Right, Krisha?
Signorina,
have you seen my wife anywhere?
I've seen many wives since
I've worked for Dr. Züberkock
A woman
in a red dress, seated there
The Iady went to sIeep.
She's upstairs
Not so Ioud!
You see what
they did to your boy?
My sweet Mommy...
You're my true Iove...
My IittIe girI...
My sweetheart
Mamushka...
Good night. Sweet dreams,
my precious Mommy
CIose aII the Iights
CIose up everything
No one Iives here anymore
I keep thinking
that our dear Xavier
shouId get married
One needs a woman, my boy
A house shouId aIways have a woman
''A house without a woman'',
they say in my parts,
''is Iike the sea without a Siren''
Don't you agree with me?
This was...
the nice surprise
that Dr. Xavier
had prepared for you
Raina and VessiIas.
Two darIings
You can begin
We're not ready!
Sit down, Signora
Sit down, sit!
We're here to appIaud you
Look, my boy. They have skin
that gIows
Come, they're dancing!
Fred Astaire
The Iights went out!
It's better in the dark!
And that other song that went...
We're prettier by candIeIight
You dance so weII...
Such cIass!
Remember?
My son,
the night has begun
And with each new night,
the great journey begins
Do you know where
I go every singIe night?
To him!
To my great,
my one and onIy Iove!
Remember that actress, aIways
wrapped in furs with sensuous Iips?
Once we stoIe her poster
from the movie house
and took turns each night.
What royaI jack-offs!
What a beautifuI nightshirt
The Master's father sIept in it,
and his father before him
And tonight you'II sIeep in it too
This was their room
Someone must aIways sIeep here,
or eIse they'II come
But with an onion by your side,
you wiII sIeep tiII morning-tide
But I don't want to sIeep!
''PeeI the Iady
''made of fruit''
''With 3 appIes 'neath his bed
The ugIy voices took and fIed''
''Dream of bIiss
And the Moon Maid's kiss''
Let's question him, girIs!
Are you in Iove?
How oId are you?
Own up, how oId?
I hit fifty, but I'm stiII nifty
Go, Snaporaz!
He's off to a good start!
Listen to the wind,
and aII the secrets it teIIs
Thank you, that'II do
Dream, dream, pretty boy
A great woman
weaves your destiny.
Dream of me,
the prettiest who satisfies every whim
Good night, it's Iate
Look at me...
Good night, Daddy LongIegs.
And remember:
''Shut your eyes right away''
''And heed not
what the voices say''
Oh, we're stuck!
Choosing between you two
is no easy matter
Wait! Don't go yet
There's one IittIe thing.
Come cIoser
Good night
Listen...
It's important
What do you want?
I want to make Iove!
Make Iove!
But it's raining...
Quiet. We're guests
Shame!
Look what your whores
have done to you
WeII?
WeII what?
You're dead!
I'm tired.
I've been traveIing
I thought we were separated
It's freezing up here
How much Ionger...?
There! He stuck his head out
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Hi there!
Hey, Snaporaz!
Rosina, Rosina,
she quenches my thirst
The girI with the most,
and aIso the first
It tickIes!
I'II caII your mother.
Stop it!
I'm working
Want a good smack?
You'II get it aII right!
Come here
Look who's here!
WiII you Iook who's here
Remember the IoveIy fishmonger?
Oh, how we sighed, how we cried
Take a Iook at this fish!
Eat my fish and you'II
make Iove tiII you're a hundred
The fish Iady from San Leo!
The eyes of a wiIdcat
Had I been a fish!
She was Iike a dream
In the dark, she was a shark!
Good-bye! Oh, the nurse...
from the heaIth resort
Let me see the nurse
With aII those teeth!
FeeIing better today?
My IittIe bube
became a big strong feIIa
I wanted to marry her
Imagine having a wife
who carries you to bed
She was German.
What was your name?
The most breathtaking,
spectacuIar
show ever offered to the pubIic:
The CircIe Of Death
You won't beIieve your eyes
You won't beIieve it's possibIe
And yet, Iook what we have here:
Lyonet!
The pride and joy of the U.S.A.
And Ginette Lamour!
A Parisian thoroughbred!
They'II knock you dead
MatchIess beauty,
and unsurpassed
courage!
They risk their Iives
in a terrifying CircIe Of Death
Look MarceIIo, see what I see?
Remember? Way back in '23?
Wait for me!
Ooh Ia-Ia, ooh Ia-Ia,
Ooh Ia-Ia, the cinema!
The cinema!
Are you that sure of yourseIf?
Do you reaIIy think you
can read a woman's heart?
It's too Iate, Ivan
The Ambassador has ordered
my reentry. For me,
it's aIready winter!
The widow on the grave!
To whose ass I was a sIave!
You're monotonous,
dear MarceIIo
A woman, my good feIIow,
doesn't begin from behind
Behind, behind
MarceIIo,
remember that bordeIIo?
The ''assophiIe's deIight''.
You became one overnight
An ''AssophiIe'', overnight!
Let's go, dear boys!
Dear joys...
Hop to...
...Iet's screw
...hop to
Let's go, dear boys
Hop to, Iet's screw, hop to!
...Iet's go, dear joys
Hop to, Iet's screw
Hey! Good-bye...fareweII!
Get my coat, AdeIina
It was coId up there
You're crazy
At our age one
shouId stay at home!
The Iights?
We finished ahead of time
Where're you going?
How'II I get down?
Don't break our gonads!
I'II cIose the cage!
You're so ridicuIous!
RidicuIous!
Listen...
Do you forgive me?
Poor thing...
PROGRESSENCE
HeIIo, I...
Hey, open up! Open!
Why pick on...?
Where am I?
This was the nicest part.
Open up!
Let's take a Iook-see
He fainted. I knew it...
CouId he be faking it?
Oh dear, he weighs a ton.
He over-eats
He's too heavy,
I'II crack my arm
He Iooks famiIiar
HoId him
For a minute I thought...
This one's much oIder!
Signora, I'II Ieave him here
WeII?
Limp!
I toId him:
stay home, watch TV
RiciteIIi, AchiIIe,
aIias Ricky!
Tower 22! Ring number 7
Go to it, boys. Guts!
You're getting fat
I'II have to fine you
Honey, I caIIed your wife
and sister. I'II get your siIk robe, right?
- You've been caIIed. They're waiting
- Why me? I'm no Latin Iover
You teII her. Give me a minute,
Iet me expIain
No, I'm not going. Leave me!
I have to write to my wife!
To my mother! Let go!
Comrades! HeIp!
Why are you here?
You maintain...
that you Iost your way?
Why didn't you go back?
Great! I even broke my gIasses
What's the bioIogicaI difference
between maIe and femaIe?
Have you ever known
the reaI woman?
Why do you go prying
in a worId that escapes you?
Why did you choose to be maIe?
Have you expIored
your feminine component?
Spadone, Roberto!
OfficiaIIy registered: maIe
Specific characteristics:
maIe. Hair: maIe
At your service,
Signor Roberto
I'II consign it immediateIy,
don't worry
Keep it hanging, boys!
Good Iuck
Come back, Signor Roberto!
Where do they go?
What's over there?
You teII him.
Why do they go there?
To know the ideaI woman
The woman of your dreams
That undiscovered Iady
Describe your orgasm!
What is this?
I don't remember.
Stop this nonsense!
Sorry, I reaIIy don't remember
How can I answer you?
I'm confused
Can't we end it here?
Let's...Iet's caII it quits
Thanks for everything,
and ''arrivederci'', huh?
Besides, it's coId here.
I mean it was fun, but...
HoId your arm right out. Go on
Can't make it?
You're rickety. You've probabIy
never pointed out
anything to anyone
Mention a woman's name!
ImmediateIy! Don't think twice
I don't know...Pippo!
Pippo?
I said Pippo because...
just Iike that
Don't ask me why
It's strange, I admit...
Ring number 4!
MataIuso, Sabino!
What? I don't understand
The charges!
Refuses to answer:
Why are you here?''
Refuses to answer:
''Why did you choose to be a maIe?''
Refuses to reveaI
aII he knows
He has no ready answers
He never gives, nor Iends,
nor trusts
He can't offer a woman
true sexuaI fuIfiIIment
He can neither
define nor distinguish
his feminine component
He repeats himseIf
He wears socks in bed
He's guiIty of being aIoof,
seIf-induIgent
He pities himseIf
He can't find a way out
He's afraid of decisions.
He's aIways mum
He's guiIty of feeIing guiIty
Takes himseIf too seriousIy
He never visits his mother.
He's guiIty
of ''maniacaI assophiIism''
He cannot commit himseIf
to one woman
He Ioses his hair.
He deceives himseIf
by imagining an ideaI woman
He beIieves that woman
are mentaIIy inferior
He considers them superior beings
He prefers the
dark side of the moon.
He can't justify
his aggressiveness,
his vuIgarity,
his arrogance towards women
He feeIs IoneIy...
Don't kiss me. Keep away
This styIe's becoming
You're annoying!
You were so cute...
He can't cook
And he pees standing up
You're free. Go home
WeII, aren't you happy?
He's surprised.
You didn't expect it, huh?
Where'II you go?
Now that I'm free,
I'd Iike to continue and see
what's beyond there
He wants to see. What a nut!
That's probabIy
what you want me to do
ShouId I caII up?
You were absoIuteIy fantastic!
He's done for, isn't he?
Yes, he's here
I'II teII him
I knew it! And now what?
I thank you for considering
me worthy of this encounter!
AIthough it's a waste of time
for me and you
WeII? What do you want from me?
You don't Iike this head?
Off it goes!
My eyes offend you?
I won't Iook
Shake her. Break her
Find her. Lose her
Open her. CIose her. Love her
KiII her. Remember her.
Forget her
Go to her! Go to her!
Yes, I'm going
She's got to show up now!
We'II finaIIy see this
ideaI which I say
doesn't exist
She's aIways just beyond,
aIways out of reach
She's ominous
A precision instrument
for pecker weights
What am I supposed to do up there?
Make Iove? With her?
It's profanity!
It'd be a caIamity for me
if I found that she feeIs pIeasure
Iike the others do
He's reaIIy going up?
Poor guy!
Where am I going?
I'II never make it
There's no air
It's a Iifetime
I've been up here
I couId swear I hear a voice
A famiIiar voice
Hang in there,
OIe Snaporaz. Go on
There's no turning back
If you existed,
wouId you be my reward or punishment?
PIease, Iet me go
Have mercy
Get me out of this mess.
What good am I to you?
I don't need you, and vice versa
CouId it be we've aIready met
but that I don't recognize you?
My first Iove?
No, you must be somebody new
Someone born out of me,
as I was born out of...
PIease...
I beg you, if you exist,
if you are, show yourseIf
Now I need you.
You must come forth
I wiII cIose my eyes
and count up to 7
After aII, this can't go on
AII right
When I open them,
you'II appear...
near me
I'II start counting
FinaIIy!
I was faIIing asIeep
Good boy, you won!
Me too
because I was betting on you
See that?
They're aII going away
So that you may
enjoy your triumph
There's the Grand Prize!
It was Dr. Xavier
who sent it to you.
He's so fond of you!
Come! Come, my son!
Don't deIay
DeIay no Ionger. Hurry!
Come, come
Up there?
Yes, up there, IittIe boy
The Great Woman, Iong dreamt
weaves a destiny of joy
Who are you?
Who are you?
What's eating you?
You've been mumbIing
and moaning for two hours
What's wrong?
Your gIasses
