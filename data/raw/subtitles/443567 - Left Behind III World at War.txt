Funny thing about a dream
When you re asleep
no matter what happens
no matter how crazy it might be
it all seems to make sense
I was there when millions ofpeople
vanished off the face of the earth
but I didn t wake up
I cheered as the world came together
in the name ofpeace
As race politics
and religion
no longer mattered
l should have known
it was too good to be true
and maybe it was
And when one single man
rose to power
to rule the entire world
l watched it all happen
l helped him get there
That s when the dream
turned into a nightmare
And like that instant in a dream
when you fall
that s when l should have sat
bolt upright in my bed
but l didn t
l can only hope
that l m not trapped here forever
that l m not already dead
spending an eternity in hell
and l can only pray
that God decides
to wake me soon
Where are these Bibles going?
Utah That truck
They re here! Bail! Bail! Run! Run!
Let s go! Peter let s go!
Where s Chris?
He s coming
Call for backup
You re under arrest!
Bruce we can t leave him
We gotta get these Bibles out of here
We can t leave him
As you know l can execute you
right now if l want to
So who do you work for?
The
Son
of
Man
Last chance
Who do you work for?
God Almighty
Wrong answer
Those aren t pigeons
you re shooting are they?
Nope
Pull
l was thinking
that the terror attacks
on the GC buildings
those missing weapons
and those few people who for some
reason can t stand the idea of peace
Pull
And l ve been thinking about
the militia s intelligence
that seems to be getting
more and more powerful
What about that conversation we had
just last week
about how vulnerable we d be if we
got rid of too many of our weapons?
Pull
What are you saying?
That the militia knew exactly
where those missiles were
and my guess is
they had the codes as well
What do you think about that John?
Look around you
They re not even looking at us
Why would they?
You re my vice president
my best friend Loyal
You could shoot me before
they even knew what happened
l m fighting for America not against it
and you should be too
And America
is the will of its people
and just like the rest of the world
it s a new way
They ve chosen a single man
When those people disappeared
it changed everything
They looked at the bigger picture
Politics religion race
it didn t matter
That s when Nicolae stepped in
And America stepped out
There are 1 72 countries
in this world
and all 1 72 voted
to drop their weapons
in the name of peace
lt s a new way
and l m happy to be part of it
Oh you were a part of it
Nicolae is planning
to attack America
and l can prove it
These transmissions
that you say were deceptive
what do they say exactly?
Well they were coded
so it was impossible to know
exactly what they said
but we did pick up certain
scientific references
chemical formulas
Formulas?
What kind of formulas?
Biological
The kind that can wipe out an
entire country in a matter of days
What else?
There are about 200 people
with the technical expertise
to pull off that kind
of biological warfare
Half of them have been assigned
to projects that don t even exist
Look you say we re
close friends right?
Yeah
Why did you not come to me with this
in the first place?
l was about to
Just for argument s sake
let s just say that it s the GC
they re developing
biological weapons
What makes you think that the United
States is one of its prime targets?
Go Go!
Hey what are you doing?
Hey where are you going?
Call in air!
John come on
Are you okay sir?
Who are you?
Mallory was a good man
A man you could trust
Know that
Love is patient
Love is kind
lt is not jealous forceful
arrogant or rude
lt does not insist on its own way
Love is not irritable or resentful
lt does not rejoice at wrong
but rejoices at right
Love bears all things
believes all things
hopes all things
endures all things
Love never ends
So faith hope and love abide
these three
but the greatest of these
is love
Buck Buck
Yeah
Thanks
From the moment l met you
l knew l had never known
love before
Chloe Steele l love you
and l choose you to be my wife
To live with you
to make you laugh
to stand by your side
and to sleep in your arms
to be joy for your heart
and with God s help
comfort for your soul
You helped lead me
to the most important truth
and l m eternally grateful to you
And now
l m eternally yours
forever one
l knew l should have gone first
Cameron Williams
Buck
l thought you d never ask
l was a silly girl with a big dream
and a really big crush
To be yours and yours alone
to laugh with you in good times
support you in bad
to comfort you with my body
and mirror you with my soul
to share everything with you
And now my dream
has come true
And l shall be yours
for as long as we both shall live
from now until eternity
l m being upstaged
by my own daughter
l met you at the beginning
of my new life
when l was prepared
for hardship sacrifice
the end of the world anything
but not for you
Amanda Susan White
l wasn t prepared for the way
that you make me smile
the way you make me feel
the way you make me
a better man
You are a blessing
for a life that does not deserve it
And l promise God
that l will love you today
and for the rest of my life
Captain Rayford Steele
you are not the man
l ever thought l d marry
Thanks
Too good looking
too confident
too successful
too tall
but then l saw that you were
determined to be the man
and the father
the leader that God
had chosen you to be
and suddenly l felt chosen
to be your helper
your mate your friend
and your wife
Rayford you are the man
l will marry
God is glorious
And l promise to thank him for you
for the rest of my life
And with that
it gives me immense
pleasure and joy
to pronounce you
Buck and Chloe
Ray and Amanda
in the name of Jesus Christ
our Lord and Savior
man and wife
You may kiss your brides
So Ray where does Nicolae
have you flying to?
Well the rumor is New Babylon
but it changes daily
A honeymoon in New Babylon
l hear lraq s beautiful this time of year
And how about you guys?
Oh l don t know l m sure
we ll find something to do
Oh boy
Hey
And you our fearless leader?
Go see Chris family
go about the Father s business
l suppose you ll be joining him
Dad we ve been over this
We feel called to take back
and share these Bibles Ray
l spent most of my life
pretending to serve God
l m through pretending
Yeah l know see but you re talking
to the father and the husband
of a young girl
that almost got shot yesterday
l l know l l know
But some security guard a GC trooper
or Nicolae himself
will not choose
when our journey is over
God will decide
We ll be safe in the palm of his hand
in the center of his will
Like Chris was?
Yes
Vice President Mallory
has been assassinated
President Fitzhugh is hurt
but still alive
Oh my
l ve gotta get to Washington
Wait Let s pray
All right
Father if we do nothing but admit
to knowing you and loving you
they send us for reeducation
lf we lift a finger
to spread your word
they sentence us as terrorists
Even if we make it to court
it is a dark and fearful world
yet we are reminded of your word
Yea though we walk through
the valley of the shadow of death
we will fear no evil
for you are with us
Your rod and your staff
will comfort us
for you ve prepared a table before us
in the presence of our enemies
Amen
Mr President
All intel points to the militia
You re sure?
What about the bodies?
Nothing sir Clean
We re running their prints and DNA
And those two motorcyclists
anything yet?
Nothing sir
What is it?
Nicolae s office called sir
He wants to see you
Mr President
You re tough Gerald
Thank the gods
l m sorry about the vice president
l know he was a friend
Despite all this
we must stay the course
The militia think l m Big Brother
The Christians think l m Satan
lt won t change any of their minds
by acts of good or kindness
They ll all think it s part of the game
Look at the global community
we formed
Think of what we ve achieved
lt was unthinkable
Look at the sky Mr President
Tell me something
what color do you see?
Blue
Maybe what l see
is what you d call green
There is no real way of knowing
is there?
l guess not
lt s that little grain of mustard seed
that s what dissenters do Gerald
They sow seeds of doubt
Militia does it
out of a sense of fear
out of an inability
to trust Christians
well they tell you what kind
of faith they want: blind
lt only takes a little bit of doubt
to cloud their entire dream
For the good of all mankind
we must stop this from happening
Steve Plank to see you sir
Very well five minutes
Have Ms Miller come in
to show the president out
Yes sir
You re a good man Gerald
l am grateful to call you a friend
Mr President my assistant
Ms Miller
Hello
Hello
l m so sorry to hear
about Vice President Mallory
He was a good man
a man you could trust
Something wrong Gerald?
Oh no sir
Actually Ms Miller and l
met at a function a few years ago
l m very flattered you remembered me
Mr President
How can l forget?
Hey Hey
Have a seat
Who do you work for?
My guess is you already know that
lndulge me
Global Community Weekly
And who do you answer to?
Nicolae Carpathia
That s a Bible
Your Bible Mr Williams
You know how the GC frowns
on hate literature
l ve been doing research
l m sure you have
You have two options
Option number one:
You give me all the right answers
to my questions
l ll think about not putting
a bullet into your head
Option two
Option one is fine
Are you one of them?
Christian?
l haven t done anything
l will decide that myself
Now do you renounce
the name of Jesus Christ?
Yes or no?
No
No l don t
Somehow l don t think Nicolae
would be thrilled with that answer
Mr President
Desperate times lt s a matter of trust
Mr Williams
l m a Christian
What s next?
l was told that somebody was planning
a biological attack on this country
Does that sound familiar?
Then l asked myself if l was a terrorist
and wanted to kill millions of people
with biological weapons
what would l do?
What would a nice Christian
like yourself be doing stockpiling
all the vaccines
you can get your hands on?
Answers now prayers later
The answer is in there
Matthew chapter 24 verse 3
And as he sat upon
the Mount of Olives
the disciples came to him
privately saying:
Tell us when shall these things be
and what shall be the sign
of thy coming
and of the end of the world?
And Jesus answered
and said unto them
Read that
Pestilences?
ls that it?
Not tornado or earthquake
That s in there too
but there s no vaccines for those
Webster defines pestilence
as a serious infectious disease
that spreads rapidly
and kills large groups of people
So in a word yes
And before you write it off as paranoia
read the next verse
Then shall they deliver you up
to be afflicted
and shall kill you
and you shall be hated
of all nations for my name s sake
You You meaning Christians
right?
Fits pretty well doesn t it?
For his name s sake
you almost put a bullet in my head
about five minutes ago
All right what about the militia?
They have their reasons
for going after Nicolae
lt has nothing to do with us
You both hate Nicolae
We know who he is The Bible refers
to him as the beast of Revelation
He s the Antichrist
Wouldn t you all want him dead?
He s the Antichrist
You can t kill him
Here in the real world
what are your sources telling you?
Nicolae has put together
a powerful group of scientists
from different fields
Biologists chemists
from all over the world
We don t know why or what
he s meeting with them about
but whatever they re talking about
it s happening in the U S
Where?
l don t know
ls that it?
That s it
All right you re free to go
We ll be in touch with you
Good luck with those earthquakes
Hattie
Hi Ray
l heard you were here
l figured you d never get around
to introducing me to your new wife
so l took it upon myself
l was just giving Mandy
my congratulations
and giving her a few pointers
about you
Hattie
lt s okay
Considering the circumstances
Hattie has been very gracious
Women don t heal
as quickly as men do
That s very sweet
but l think l ve healed very well
in the arms of Nicolae
But l hope we can be friends
despite Ray s and my past
Of course l d like that
You seem delightful Mandy
l hope it works out
Hattie l hope it works out
for you too
Just listen to your heart okay?
l always do
Hello
Hi Buck You got a minute?
Yeah two minutes
Yeah thanks
Yeah what s up?
Something s going on
Some sort of outbreak
a lot of people are sick
What are the doctors saying?
We ve got 18 cases here
in Chicago
All members
of the underground churches
Hopefully it s confined to there
Except it s happening at a dozen of our
sister churches across the country
So you think somebody s
carrying it in?
Must be
You know what that means?
Every new face could be
a killer sent by Nicolae
carrying a pocketful of anthrax
Yeah and they know
we ll never close our doors
We need the vaccines
Maybe those will work
Send somebody for them
and get Chloe out of there
Can l see some lD?
Yes?
Thank you
Ms Miller
please forgive meeting here
Work just never ends
l could think of a lot
worse places sir
Thank you
l have to tell you you look much better
without that MP5
Okay
That day how d you know?
We had a tip
Unfortunately the tip didn t come
soon enough to save John
What d you find?
lt turns out that Buck Williams
is right
Most of the bioscientists
we re trying to track
are in fact in the United States
lt s a big country
l realize that
We don t know exactly where
but we do know that
the traffic on the secure lines
into the GC Headquarters
has increased immensely
in the last 48 hours
Have you been able to crack codes
or intercept any transmissions?
No not yet sir but we have been able
to track most of the communications
back to a power plant just
a few clicks outside of Washington
So what do you think?
l think that we should go
and look at it Tonight
l know you need proof sir
John did try and tell you
and moments later they killed him
So tell me Ms Miller
are you married?
lt s Carolyn Yes l was married
My husband died a few days
after the vanishings
l m sorry
He was a journalist
He was working on a big story
and apparently he struck a nerve
somewhere along the line
What happened?
Eric called and told me that
he had uncovered a huge story
a front page story
and he told me he was scared
and l didn t ever see him again
And they told me that he
That he fell off
the Staten lsland Ferry
So l got in touch with John
for his help
John never told me
l think at first he was just doing a favor
for the widow of an old friend
but l got him all the e mails
all of Eric s notes that l could find
and he had trouble
fitting the pieces together
until Nicolae started confiscating
all the weapons
And that s why he got you a job
on Nicolae s staff
and into the militia
l don t like this idea
and your dad won t either
You re supposed to love and obey
These vaccines weigh a ton
You know we should be packing for
our honeymoon like normal people
Maybe l should come with you
No you need to stay here
l m really proud of you
you know?
Yeah l m just doing
what l m called to do
We all are
The next person that shakes
your hand could be the
Don t think like that
We really need to keep our faith
in times like these
Sometimes it s all that we have
lsn t this where you re supposed to tell
me that everything s gonna be okay?
Hey of course it will
Remember what Bruce told us
at our wedding
We can t die
until God says it s time
Right That was so romantic
We ll get in there sir
Come on
Bibles
Come on
Room 21 westbound corridor
section three
We got them
That way We re on our way
Let s go move it
What have l done?
You didn t know
l helped him become a global Hitler
What makes me any different?
You know my My father he died
during the California primaries
He never did see me
become president
but l have no doubt
that he died believing it
l m sure he was very proud of you
You know the last thing he told me
he said Gerry
you will change the world
He squeezed my hand
he smiled and he died
l guess he was right
l changed the world all right
Hey Ray
Oh aren t we jumpy?
So
you married Ms
Goody Two Shoes
Did you know she has a Bible
stashed in your suite?
That s okay l didn t report it We both
know what would happen if l did
Don t worry
l can keep a secret
lf l want to
You know l ve never even hinted
to Nicolae that you re a Christian
Never even told him
that you and l almost
Do you know why
l didn t tell him Ray?
Because maybe l still love you
And maybe you still love me
Please no
Don t say no
You loved me once Ray
At least admit that
Do you remember our layover
in Rome?
You told me you loved me
But you hesitated because
your marriage was too important
And then she was gone
and then God was too important
And now you have a new woman
Please Hattie Come on stop
Why don t you admit it Ray?
Why won t you admit you want me?
You always have even now
What about Nicolae?
Nicolae has many lovers
We have an understanding
Listen you have made
some bad decisions okay?
lf you would just see the truth
Jesus?
Please come on Ray Ray
Ray just kiss me
Come on
Just kiss me once
Tell me you don t love me
l don t love you
l m sorry
l m sorry too
For you and Amanda
l just need a minute
Just a minute
l m so cold and so hot
Do you want some water?
Just keep your eyes closed
you ll feel better
Where d everyone go?
Where is everyone?
They all left
They trusted in God to save them
but he s no longer here
No No
You You re lying
Am l?
Look at you
Did God take your pain away?
Why did he leave you here?
Please help me
Okay
Here
Drink this
That s it
There you go
What s wrong?
Just trust me
You
You know who l am
We used to be good friends
Are you all right?
lt s okay Bruce lt s okay
lt s okay
Just get some rest
lt s okay it s okay it s okay
Did John do this?

Question is did Nicolae?
Prime Minister Walsh
President Pasha

has created biological weapons
Now with due respect Mr President

that Nicolae intends
to hit America
with the tactical weapons
he was supposed to be destroying
Take a look

Global satellite
We broke the code two hours ago
Time frame?

What s he asking you to do?
Let s ask him
Heavenly Father

Chloe
Buck This is Fitz
Just called to tell you
that you were right
Nicolae is infecting Bibles
with some new kind of virus

But there s more
He s going to attack America
And we re gonna try and stop him

an attack on that factory

l do not wanna lose
another good friend
Thanks
Sir?
l think your father
would be very proud
You may not have seen
through Nicolae s lies
but you ve done what you thought
was right all the way along
l just hope l m not too late
l just spoke to Buck
He found the source of the virus
Oh thank you Jesus
You can You can stop it?
We can stop the spread
What is it?
What is it you re not telling me?
Bruce it was the Bibles
Nicolae poisoned the Bibles
and then he let us take them
lt was given unto him to make war
with the saints and overcome them
What are you saying?
That it was my doing
That it was my doing
No no
You put the word of the Lord
in front of millions of souls
and what does he promise?
What does he promise? Bruce
That his word
will not return unto him void
That he will achieve that which
he here was set to accomplish
And that was your doing
And ours
They re already making calls
We did reach many souls
lt s okay
And thank you Lord
for the guidance
which we know you will show
our brother Buck
Amen
Amen
Thank you
Without faith it s impossible
to please him
lt s okay
For those who come to God
you must believe that he is
and that he is the rewarder
of those who diligently seek him
l do believe
Behold
the father of faithfulness
Abraham
Abraham
The Lord asked Abraham
to sacrifice his own son
and because Abraham
put it all in God s hand
it was accounted unto him
for righteousness
What are you saying?
The great heroes of faith
what do they all have in common?
Did they all get rewards?
No Thousands were killed
burned at the stake
crucified as our Lord
Did they all suffer? No
Countless received
the greatest miracles imagined
as they crossed
through the Red Sea
stopped the mouths of lions
walked through the fiery furnace
So what do they all have
in common?
Stand still
They gave it all over
They put their own ways
behind them
They that wait upon the Lord
will renew their strengths
and mount up
with wings as eagles
They shall run and not be weary
They shall walk and not faint
Stand still
Stand still
And wait upon the Lord
And wait upon the Lord
What?
l have to stay
Take care of our girl Ray
Plane s all set
We re ready to go
l didn t know Nicolae
had a flight out this morning
He doesn t
No? Then where are you going?
Chicago Some of my friends are sick
my daughter needs me
Well that s too bad Ray
You have responsibilities here
l ve already lost one child l m not
We all have problems Ray
and l m tired of listening
and dealing with yours
Hattie please come with us
We can help each other
l can t
You wouldn t understand
l think l do
How far along now?
Three months
You re pregnant?
Does Nicolae know?
l don t think so
Then you can come with us
We can take care of you
Hattie come with us
We can protect you
You can t protect me
You don t know Nicolae
He would never let me go
That is why you have to come
with us
l can t
My life is here
l was gonna turn you in Ray
Hattie
Don t say anything
Just leave before l change my mind
Here
This is mine
You look tired Rough night?
lt was great thank you
And Ms Miller how is she?
Very well
Yet in the middle
of your steamy reunion
you took the time to order a raid
l got a tip about a warehouse
being a militia hideout
possibly storing weapons
of mass destruction
And was it?
Oh not at all
But that s not to say
that it wasn t before
but l think their intelligence was
more sophisticated than l thought
Or yours less
l understand that the agents
were not the first ones there
Well l
l wanted a small unit just in case
the tip was a little unreliable
You look different today Gerald
There s something new in your eyes
l see things you know
President Fitzhugh excellent
Mr President
The major can show you our plans
We can move on his power structure
in New Babylon from Egypt
Tactical strikes first
followed by a quick ground push
British troops will surround
and launch on Heathrow
which is the hub of his airpower
We re ready to move
on his primary U S strongholds
lt s a mistake
Why? Do we have a choice?
You said yourself that it was
our only chance to surprise him
That may be so but we ve
gotta take Nicolae out
lf we kill him
we ve avoided world war
lf we don t Nicolae will take out
anyone and everyone in his path
Exactly That s why
we can t afford to
We have got to have
a contingency
Now if Nicolae isn t dead
by 2200 hours then we strike
What do you have in mind?
l haven t been searched yet
This is porcelain
You can t do it
l m the only one who can
This is one of our
newest transponders
communicates with three
different satellites
Once activated a missile
could be there in under a minute
Long enough for you to get out?
l hope so
Mr President you re expected
Should have gone with him
helped him
Gerald?
Right on time
You played me
l was your right hand
Don t flatter yourself
You d be surprised
who my right hand really is
l know about the virus
You re going to attack America
Of course you do
Do you really think l didn t know
about John or Carolyn
or that little adventure?
So what now expose me?
Are you going to activate
your little transponder?
Starting to panic yet?
l don t need a missile to stop you
Just one thing
before you shoot me
World War III has begun
Anti Global Community forces
have launched an all out attack
In the U S heavy fighting is
taking place across the country
and there are now unconfirmed
reports of militia nuclear strikes
New York Chicago and Washington
are all under fire at this time
as GC forces engage
with militia terrorists
Reports of heavy widespread damage
and casualties continue to come in
GC ground air and marine forces
have now shut down all ways
in and out of every major city
in and out of every major city
We have no confirmation
of non tactical weapons
being deployed
but from the extensive damage
and casualties
it appears some weapons of mass
destruction have been used
Those opposed to peace and Nicolae
Carpathia s Global Community
have attacked us tonight
God don t leave me here
There are leaders involved
at top levels
Prime Minister Tom Walsh of Britain
President Abbas Pasha of Egypt
and even U S President Gerald
Fitzhugh have all been identified
Warrants for their arrest have been
Beyond us who else knew?
Every kingdom divided against itself
is brought to desolation
Thank you Gerald
Thank you for giving the world
every reason to believe in me
and hate all those
who stand in my way
What do you think Mr President?
ls it empty?
Why don t you put it away
before you get hurt
lt was nice of you
to drop in for a visit
Now time to leave
Welcome to my world Mr President
That s not humanly possible
ls it?
We ve been attacked on every front
before even firing a single shot
Either he was broken or turned
but it had to be him
It s over We have to surrender
No we can t sir We regroup
our forces for a counterattack
How? The GC isn t occupying
just one city or even one country
It is occupying the entire world
Then we strike wherever we can
Guerilla style We cannot let him win
Strike with what?
We have nothing left
What if Fitz got him?
Get it through your head
Fitzhugh betrayed us
He didn t
Mr President
Nicolae played us like a puppet
He wanted war and we gave it to him
How did we do that?
He knew everything about us
l don t know how he did it all
The truck was his
He betrayed us
We all will be dead soon
What happened?
Did Did you kill him?
He He was expecting me
He knew all about the transponder
His attacks had already begun
He just switched on the news
and then smiled
And ?
l l had him
l had him l shot him point blank
He just stood there
l emptied a full clip
three feet away
and he just stood there
You missed?
l can hardly miss at this close range
Chloe?
Buck
Oh baby are you okay?
How are you doing? How s Bruce?
He s going home Buck
lt s a matter of minutes now
Buck I love you so much
Oh baby l m so sorry

No you re doing God s will

in my apartment
watching World War lll
through a window
and you re a million miles away

Chloe?
Hey somebody! Help me!
Oh this is not the God l know
Come on come on
Three feet away
and you not only missed
you also somehow miraculously
managed to escape
No one tried to stop you
after you unloaded a gun at Nicolae
l was thrown out of a window
Out his office window?
Yes yes l know
This is ridiculous If I was there
I d shoot you myself
Ms Miller if there is
such a thing as God
may he watch over you
What? You re not going to shoot me
are you?
How could you ?
How could you set us all up?
Do you really believe that?
You want me to believe
that Nicolae magically knew
every move
we were gonna make
that he s bulletproof
and you fell out a window
and walked away?
Sir
lt was the truth
Why did you let this happen God?
What did ? What did l do?
Tell me
ls this some kind of game?
ls this some kind of test?
Why?
Why are you doing this to me?
To Chloe?
What if l just go to Chicago
right now
What are you gonna do?
Kill me?
How could you?
How could you set us all up?
How could you set us all up?
How could you?
He was a good man
How could you betray everybody?
John come on!
That s what you want me to believe?
My God
Please help me
Bruce
l m glad to see you here
You must be strong Ray
l m here for you Bruce
Not me
Where is she?
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no l told you to leave
l told you Why didn t you listen?
My brother l m so sorry
She wanted to do God s will
Just like you
Just like me
God understands your pain Ray
Your faith is stronger than you think
You will do
You will do great things
in his name
Now l can only hope
that l m not trapped here forever
that l m not already dead
spending an eternity in hell
and l can only pray
that God decides
to wake me soon
Mr President
Buck
Whether it was you and the militia
or someone else
this day was coming
l ve failed an entire nation
What are you doing here?
l told you on the phone
l l feel that God wants me here
Don t you have
any other place to go?
That virus
it got my best friend
and my wife
They re dying
So why are you here with me?
Chloe and Bruce
are Christians
and they are going to
a better place
But Mr President
at the moment you re not
Please listen to me
You ve sinned against God like l have
He calls us to love and obey him
in everything we do
what we do in front of people
what we do in secret
even down to what we think
and he will hold us accountable
Mr President look
time is running out
and l don t want you to go to hell
l ve got a feeling
it s a little too late for that
God loves you
Two thousand years ago
he proved that
God became a man Jesus Christ
and he suffered and died
on the cross to save you
He literally died
to take your punishment
and my punishment
upon himself
so that we could be forgiven
and set free
Mr President
when Jesus rose from the dead
and he ascended to heaven
he defeated death and hell
and he s offering you and l
eternal life
God can do anything
And if you are willing
God can save you
He led me here
Confess your sins
and turn away from them
and put your faith in Jesus Christ
God
please forgive me
l know l don t deserve it
Show me the way
Please tell me what to do
And God please forgive me
for doubting you
ln Jesus name
amen
Amen
Ray
What is it Bruce?
My time is near
Please Ray
l d like Communion one last time
All right
Your call was an answer to prayer
My first
What are you gonna do now?
Well l know l can t kill Nicolae But l
might be able to slow him down
When l first got there
he had just begun
lf l could take out his command center
l d finally be able to do something
How can l help?
By getting to as many people
as you can showing them the truth
the way you did to me
But this
Look look l helped build this huh?
l gave Nicolae everything he needed
to kill thousands millions of people
Now this is my mission mine alone
But there s one more thing
that l want you to do for me
Sinless pure and holy
he suffered for our sins
His body was broken for us
so that we could live
And he said
whoever repents
and trusts him
will be forgiven
and live forever
Please take this now and share it
and surrender yourself
to his will love and care
Thank you brother
Chloe l m so proud of you
A father couldn t ask
for a better daughter
God l m in your hands
Help me God
Give me the words
Gerald how did you get in here?
l came in the front door
This wine
is to remind you of the precious
blood Christ shed for you
Drink it
and live
He could say the word
and l would be healed
O death
where is thy sting?
O grave
where is thy victory?
He wanted us to have Communion
Yes Mr President
You seem to have changed
l told you l see things
Not having a good day
are you Mr President?
Well actually l m having
a great day
l resigned from the militia
and l joined your real enemy
Chloe what is it?
Drink this wine and live
lt s the wine
l can breathe
l can breathe
Thank you
Do you remember Carolyn Miller?
A lovely little thing wasn t she?
She seemed to think
that the only way to defeat you
is with weapons with the militia
When the answer
was right there in front of us
Jesus Christ
The only way to beat you
in this life or the next
is to accept him
The last thing you will ever see
is my power over his
Sometimes he doesn t
let you see it all
Sir?
Mr President?
Sir?
Buck
we ve found the antidote
lt s red wine
What?
It s a miracle
We had Communion
and it s the wine
You re sure? You re better?
Yeah l m gonna live and l m gonna
be right here waiting for you
Chloe What about Bruce?
He s gone home now Buck
I m so sorry
As God wanted it
Oh honey l love you
l love you too
l m gonna be there as soon as l can
All right l m coming
We need to talk
