Stop right there.
Put your hands
where I can see them.
Shirt off!
Come on!
Pants off!
Come on, motherfucker.
I always thought
my life would end like this,
in some godforsaken place,
from a bullet
I didn't see coming.
I just never thought I'd care.
One thing you don't want to see,
me in a suit this early
in the morning.
Means I'm working,
which means someone is about
to depart
this life unexpectedly.
- Stan.
- Yeah?
- He's late.
- It's all right.
He'll be there, okay?
Hey, listen,
I can do the guy myself.
- He's there right now.
- No, no, no, no.
Besides, I promised Bobby T
we'd give this kid a shot.
Supposed to be pretty good
with a knife.
Yeah, well that's what
you keep saying, but...
Well, uh, call me
when it's done, okay?
- He's here.
- Hey, I got these for Rollo.
'Cause I... I heard
he's a donut junkie.
So, I told him that he won
a dozen donuts
at our weekly raffle.
He loves Boston creams.
W... what's with the suit?
- What's with the shirt?
- Oh, it's part of the plan.
I made it myself.
- That's pretty smart, right?
- Yeah.
Except Krispy Kremes are spelled
with two K's.
Who the fuck knows that?
Not you.
Okay, make it quick.
You get one chance.
You fuck it up,
he's in the wind again.
Hey.
Don't worry, old timer.
I got this shit.
Trevor!
Yeah?
What is this?
All right, man.
All right. Thanks.
See ya!
- That was Rollo.
- Yeah.
Why didn't you stab him?
That's what I always do.
- Hence why they call you Blade.
- Yeah.
- I thought I'd do something different.
- Mm-hmm?
I wanna show Stan some range
and imagination.
What'd you do, poison him?
What the fuck?
Boston cream, baby!
Woo!
Come on.
What did you put in the donut?
Uh, just, like,
a little blasting cap.
Oh.
I mean, how's Beggar
gonna know it's Rollo
without his head?
- Well, there's like a...
- Shut the fuck up.
Sweet Jesus.
- Benny.
- How'd it go?
Kid fed Rollo a donut
with a bomb in it.
- That sounds kinda cool.
- Uh-huh.
Blew his head off.
I mean... uh,
Stan gonna shit himself.
Hey, listen,
there's no need to bother Stan.
I'll take care of it.
You know a guy
that knew Rollo, right?
Find out if he had any family
around here, will ya?
All right.
Miss Kramer?
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Rollo's dead.
- Yes.
- Whacked?
As it were, yes.
As it were.
Well, thanks for the heads up.
I'll make sure to look up
that life insurance policy
he never got around to getting.
I came here to discuss
a problem that's arisen.
And if I'm not interested
in your problem?
Oh, well...
I see.
You'll slap duct tape
over my mouth
and shove me in the trunk.
Only if you're into
that kind of thing.
Just wanna talk.
Wait in the car, Donut.
I'd offer you one,
but you just killed my ex.
You don't seem too upset.
I expected him to be deceased
long before today,
given the business he was in.
Huh.
You have a thing
for dead animals, Miss Kramer?
Marcie. I'm a taxidermist.
Mm. Don't find many of those.
It's a niche thing.
He looks angry.
Like someone stole his acorns
and he's gonna make 'em pay.
Really?
I'm not up
on my beaver expressions.
- I could be wrong.
- I was going for indignant.
Oh, yeah. I see it.
Don't ever mess with my acorns.
I have a small problem,
Miss, uh...
- Marcie.
- Marcie.
I have to convince
a certain person
that the body in that trunk
out there is indeed Rollo.
Something happen to his face?
Yeah. It's missing.
Along with the rest of his head.
There's five grand in it for you
if you come with me and vouch
that Rollo is indeed Rollo.
I could use the money.
But I swore I'd never get back
into that world.
So, I'll save you the dough
and myself some time.
Brother's a tattoo artist.
Gave Rollo and I matching
tattoos as a wedding gift.
- Oh.
- Our ass cheeks.
I had Rollo removed last year.
Why'd you?
Have him removed?
I don't know.
It's usually
along the lines of someone
trying to fuck someone
else over, that type of thing.
That type of thing would be
on the top of Rollo's resume.
Well, there you go now.
Anyway, he... he made it
back here to Biloxi
and it just happens
to be my boss's territory.
So, we're being courteous to
our colleagues in New Orleans.
I love how you guys
are so courteous.
Pop the trunk, Donut.
Horrible drapes.
Yeah, they went nice
with the kitchen.
- That's Rollo's ass.
- See? Come on, man.
We didn't need his head,
after all.
You got all pissy for nothing.
- Why don't you...
- Oops.
Bet you didn't know Beggars
and Rollo were cellmates at Angola.
Pretty sure he's seen
that tattoo up-close.
Stan's not gonna
like this, Donut.
- Stop calling me Donut!
- Okay.
Get your gun out! Gun!
Now.
Put it in the car.
Fuck Stan.
Beggar said I could come
work for him anytime.
He's moving up.
And this'll prove
I'm ready for his crew.
If I ever hear anybody call me
Donut again,
I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna gut you.
Old timer.
Don't call me Donut,
motherfucker!
I don't believe I got your name.
Charlie.
I'm moving up, baby!
I'm moving up!
Woo!
Ooh, sh...
Oh, shit.
Have you worked with him before?
No, first time.
- What a mess.
- It's okay. The car is stolen.
I was referring to the kid.
Looks like he shot himself.
Well, he was
more of a knife guy.
Shit.
Well...
you know, they're kinda...
Kinda the same size.
Maybe go visit your brother,
the tattoo artist,
maybe he could, you know,
kinda... no?
Fine, but I'm not cutting
his head off.
Yeah, Scotty Porter
looking a lot more
active out there.
He's really coming along,
that guy.
- You put cilantro in here?
- No.
Well, I distinctly taste lemon.
- Yeah. It's called lemon.
- I detest cilantro.
That's why I used lemon.
Did you... did you get
this chicken at that Domenic's?
Domenic's is in the North End.
We're in Biloxi.
That's right, I don't know
what the heck's gotten into me.
Anyway, the point is, it's
very good, don't get me wrong.
It's very good,
even with the cilantro.
I think personally that
you should open a restaurant.
Well, the only way to make money
in that business is to skim.
And you can't skim off yourself.
No, well, I mean,
who in their right mind
goes into
the restaurant business?
There's no money in...
In the restaurant business.
None whatsoever.
You know, you have to
divest yourself
of that notion, Charlie.
- Uh-huh.
- What?
Watch the game, Stan.
Stan Mullin, my boss.
He's run Biloxi for 47 years.
Been a while since he started
forgetting things.
Okay.
So, I took it upon myself
to look out for him.
I owed him that.
I got you some fish oils!
Omega threes.
Good for your heart.
Leftovers are in the fridge
in case you're hungry later.
Yeah.
- Too bad about the kid.
- Yeah, it's a shame.
What were you thinking,
letting a young kid like that
do a job like that?
I'm sorry, Stan.
Won't let it happen again.
- We gonna have any trouble?
- No.
I took care of it.
- Sleep well.
- Thanks, partner.
Beggar Mercado,
street thug
turned Ninth Ward crew chief.
One of the new breed of bosses
cutting a swathe
through New Orleans.
Let's see.
The guy who did him
got a little carried away.
Kid named Blade.
Maybe you know him.
Don't ring a bell, baby.
And that's Rollo?
It's him.
- Where'd you find him?
- There you go, man.
Rental, near the airport.
Got him?
With his ex's name on the lease.
Dumb fuck.
- How's Stan?
- Still Stan.
I reached out to him
for a sit-down.
He didn't reach back, though.
I got a lot of ideas
I know he'd like.
New construction,
new casinos, hotels.
Juicy territory.
You're his guy.
Make it happen.
We good?
Ah.
First time Rollo's ever
contributed anything
to this relationship.
Thanks.
- By the way, why didn't you?
- What?
Slap duct tape over my mouth,
put me next to Rollo?
Not my style.
Besides, you dealt
with the situation straight up.
- Don' t see that often.
- From a woman?
From anybody.
Hey.
You wanna get something to eat?
- Wow, where'd that come from?
- My mouth.
Which appears to have
circumvented my brain,
but there you have it.
Why?
- Celebrate.
- What, the dead guys?
Problem solved.
Situation avoided.
Found money.
You pick one.
- Mm. Phenomenal.
- Good.
Who'd have thunk you'd find
something this divine
at a place called Tuscan Tomato.
Well, the owner's from Treviso.
A guy named Claudio.
Not so good at English,
but fantastic chef.
What's... what... what's in this?
Malfatti,
ricotta, flour
and, uh, blanched spinach.
And you know this how?
Well, I just like
to cook, you know?
That's kind of like
a hobby for me.
- But mostly Italian.
- Why Italian?
Well, when I was stationed
in Italy for a while there,
you know, I don't know.
I just fell in love
with the culture.
Love everything Italian.
Why taxidermy?
All right.
I like giving everlasting life
to something that didn't have
a fair chance at one.
- Hmm.
- I restore their dignity.
When I give
a hunter back his trophy,
I want that animal
to haunt his dreams.
That's an intriguing profession.
No more than being
an enforcer for some mob.
- I'm not an enforcer.
- Muscle, then.
Lot of guys
with more muscle than me.
All right.
A trigger man, button guy.
I'm more like a, um, concierge.
- A fixer.
- Problem solver.
Mm. Like...
I got a body with no head
that needs identifying.
Exactly.
And if I needed tickets
on the 50-yard line
for a Saints game?
Yeah, I could get those for you.
Who would you have
to kill to get 'em?
Mm, depends on
who they're playing.
Huh.
Well, four stars
for the Tuscan Tomato.
What do you think about...
you know.
Don't think so much, Charlie.
Stay in the moment. Enjoy it.

Yeah. What

Thanks.
Not too generous.
Let's go.
I see you got
the granddaughter visiting.
I assume
you want to kill Beggar.
You know I can't sanction that.
You sanctioned a hit on Stan.
No, I did not.
That was a rogue move.
Nobody knew.
Then, what's the issue?
Beggar's an earner.
Funnels a lot of money
into the coffers.
And to stay vital,
you gotta change your way
of thinking.
Make room for the new guys.
Stan was always fair with you.
Stan's gone.
And you should be, too,
if you're smart.
I'm offering you that.
I've always had one rule, Sal.
Be good to the people
who were good to you.
Then be good
to yourself, Charlie,
and get as far away from here
as you can.
Understand,
if you kill Beggar...
Hey. I came here out of respect.
You do what you have to do.
- What did Rollo have on Beggar?
- I don't know.
But whatever it was
got him deceased.
Where is he, Beggar?
Why don't you ask
one of your crew?
I would.
But they're all dead.
You sure about that?
All right, Benny,
there's yours,
here you go, Celine.
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You seen Blade?
Hmm?
You seen Blade?
Do I look
like his parole officer?
Charlie Swift.
Uh, Celine.
- Is Benny around?
- You just missed him.
He went to go meet
some guys over at the club.
I was just gonna call him.
I'll tell him you stopped by.
I always say goodbye
to him before work.
It's just our thing.
Didn't say it today
for some reason.
You tell him I meant to.
Betrayal's a funny thing.
Its very nature
is to catch you unaware.
This one was a gut punch
I never saw coming.
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Giselle.
You comin' over

I might have to
take a rain check.
I'll let you know.
- Charlie.
- Milt.
I thought
you were doing collections.
- Not bouncer work.
- Right, sit on it.
- Place is under new management.
- Come on, one more.
- Beggar's guys already move in?
- Nice.
Soon as the lights came on.
- Ooh! Give me some shake!
- Like roaches.
You moved in

I bet you she'd be glad

early for supper.
I'll bring her some wings.
Maybe I'll get lucky.
Don't forget to get a receipt.
Yeah, that's it!
That's it! Whoo!
Charlie. No. No.
Charlie, Beggar said
Stan was finished here.
He wasn't the same, Charlie.
He wasn't
always right in the head.
You turned on your own.
I had to
make a choice for myself.
Where's Beggar?
He's been on the move
since this thing went down.
Out of his fuckin' mind, looking for
whatever that Rollo guy had on him.
He's got the whole gang
looking for it.
You ought
to get out of Biloxi, Charlie.
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.
Ooh, baby!
Esther likes to eat late.

I don't see no birdshot.
No? Look here.

Right there.
This a bad time?
Fucking Catholic.
Now I see
why you like that old man car.
Rollo was here.
He showed up
about four days before you did.
Told me he'd give me 50 grand
if I would help him rent
a place to lay low while he was
working some shakedown scheme.
I told him the whole thing was
gonna blow up in his face, and it did.
Literally.
What now?
Well, I'm gonna dump these guys,
then head to New Orleans,
Rollo's home turf.
Pretty sure whatever
they're looking for is there.
Probably
right next to my 50 grand.
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Do you have a better idea?
- What would you have me do? Sit in some hotel room?
- I don't...
Wait for you to tell me
the coast is clear?
- What if you get killed first?
- Well...
And then, I wake up one day,
and there's another Mutt and Jeff
at the foot of my bed
holding duct tape and 45s?
Besides, do you have
any idea where Rollo lived,
where he hung out,
the morons he rolled with?
I do. That 50 grand could really
change things for me.
I'm gonna find it,
with or without you.
Pack light.
So, this 50 grand,
what are you gonna do with it
if you find it, anyway?
LSU campus in Baton Rouge,
they have
a Natural History Museum.
Uh, they said
that they would like to hire me
to be the director
of avian exhibits.
- Hmm. Professor.
- No, not quite.
But they like my work.
Said if I got certified,
the job was mine.
Twenty thousand
pays for the course,
five thousand
in moving expenses,
and the rest
for a starter place.
Plus, a change of scenery
would be good for me.
New start.
What about you? You have
any plans when this is over?
My line of work, it's best
not to have any long-term plans.
You must think about something.
Mm-hmm.
♪ Hey, hey, hey! ♪
- What is this?
- A place nobody knows.
However, it does have a kitchen.
- Mm?
- So good.
Hmm. Yeah.
So, Beggar,
he decides to make his move,
and he wipes everyone out.
You end up
being the last man standing?
Well, it would appear that way.
Well, why didn't you run?
Stan Mullen, my boss,
my friend of 33 years.
A man who played by the rules,
kept his word,
did well by people.
He deserved
to go out on his terms,
only he didn't get to.
Stan's dead, Charlie.
Why does this mean
so much to you?
When I was five,
I'd wait at the door
for my pops to come home.
My cowboy hat on,
my boots on, my gun on.
He'd come in, I'd give him
a gun, and he'd say "draw."
Now, obviously,
a 25, 26-year-old man's
gonna beat a five-year-old kid
to the draw.
But what bothered me was...
that every day...
every single day,
he'd beat me to the draw.
He'd make me
put my hands up in the air,
turn round and face the wall.
Then he'd shoot me in the back.
Every day, he did that.
Then, one day,
I reared up and I said,
you know, "What's
the sense of facing the wall
if you're gonna
shoot me in the back?"
And he said,
"Well, maybe today, I won't."
So, I turn around,
face the wall, and...
Shot me in the back.
Hated him.
Now, one night...
One night, I tell this
to Stan, and he says,
"When he came home,
you should be waiting for him.
Soon as he came in,
you should've been hiding
behind the door,
and shot him in the back.
I mean, fuck giving him a gun,
and fuck giving him a chance."
He says, "In life, you can play
by someone else's rules"
or you can play by your own.
You play
by someone else's rules,
you're gonna
get fucked every time
"'cause it's their design,
not yours."
My old man was just trying
to teach me a lesson.
Stan got me to see that.
Hmm. Lifted the weight
I carried in my heart
for 30 years.
I'm gonna order some lunch.

After Beggar's guys
turned the place
upside down and inside out,
I didn't expect
to find Rollo's ace card.
I just hoped to find a clue
as to where he stashed it.

- Yes, good afternoon there.
- Oh, good afternoon, sir.
My name is Mr. Kramer.
Yes, good afternoon to you.
Listen, I'd like to check
on my room charges, please.
But I seem
to have misplaced my bill.
If you'd like, I can send
a current bill up to your room.
Oh, that would
be so much appreciated.
Could you send
maintenance up there,
please, check on my toilet?
You know, just keeps
running and running.
Of course. Room 704. Coming up.
Hey!
Couldn't find anything.
I tightened your valve.
Seems to be working, so...
Thanks, man. Here you go.
Damn thing kept me up all night.
- Have a good day.
- You got it.
Shit.
Attention, all hotel guests!
There is an active shooter
in the hotel.
Please seek shelter.
Keep your room door locked
until further notice.
There's an
active shooter in the hotel.
Keep your room door locked
until further notice.
- Charlie?
- Yeah.
Jesus, Charlie.
- What the hell happened?
- I got shot.
- By who?
- Oh, some guy.
A guy?
A guy like you, you mean.
Mm. This one was different.
Deluxe model.
Beggar's number one.
Could be you're in over
your head, Charlie.
Been doing all right
up until today.
Rollo was doing all right
'til he wasn't.
Don't get any ideas
about stuffing me
before I bleed to death.
I wouldn't.
No?
Why not?
I couldn't capture your essence.
You capture a raccoon's essence.
You're an entirely
different creature.
Hm. Well, that's for sure.
Oh, for God sake's, Charlie.
Here.
You know, you really oughta
start thinking about an exit plan.
A place to retire,
assuming you'll have a say
in the matter.
I was thinking about
buying one of these.
Hmm.
They go for a dollar.
Of course, you only have to
promise that you'll fix them up.
But, you know, it's beautiful.
This one's in Umbria.
I mean, you can find these
all over Italy.
- How long you been looking?
- Couple of years.
Well, what are you waiting for?
For them to go down to 50 cents?
It's a beautiful dream, Charlie.
You oughta go for it.
Hmm.
Yeah.
I heard that
somewhere before once.
What's funny?
Rollo's got a price on his head
and is running for his life.
Still, he calls his mama
three times from the hotel.
Well,
if it isn't "Ms. Whores R Us."
- Who the fuck are you?
- He's a friend of Rollo's.
Doesn't look like
any of his friends.
Any come by recently?
You claimin' I entertain my
son's friends here for a small fee?
- There's a shed out back he uses as his man cave.
- Don't you touch his shit!
All right. Where is it?
- What?
- The lockbox.
Probably up your gaping asshole,
son stealer.
That ain't your property,
you testicle sucker.
What's in it, he promised to me.
If he wanted you to have it,
he'd have shoved it
up your cooch.
Lord knows it's big enough.
Remember my wedding day, Mavis?
You were running around
with a Budweiser in one hand
and your Uncle Fred's dick
in the other.
July 29, seven, two, nine.
What'd you expect
to find in there?
50 grand?
In unmarked 20s and 50s?
- Where is it?
- You're looking at it.
25K each.
- Double Ds.
- Oh, God.
Nipples the size
of silver dollars now.
I'm sorry about your 50K.
Yeah, well, it was a long shot
from the get-go.
At least your disc
is still out there somewhere.
- Mm-hmm.
- Mine turned into a pair of double Ds.
Sure did.
Augh, I should've slammed the
door in his face the moment I saw him.
You gotta wonder what's
wrong with me that I didn't.
It's hard to let go of hope.
I gotta learn to let go
of a lot of things.
Looks like the bus station's
just a few blocks.
You can, uh, drop me there.
Yeah.
What you gonna do?
Survive.
We can either make ourselves
miserable or make ourselves stronger.
The amount of work is the same.
You?
Oh, I suppose I'll keep looking.
- Why?
- I don't like loose ends.
Ah. I hope they don't kill you
before you find it, then.
Thank you.
I appreciate the sentiment.
Oh, no.
I got it from here, Charlie.
- It's a loan, okay?
- No, please don't.
- Marcie, just...
- No. Look, a loan means
you're gonna be coming back
for me.
And then I gotta wonder
if you made it or not.
And then I gotta hope
you didn't change your mind.
- I can tell you right now that I'll...
- Charlie, don't.
Here, it's just, uh,
just a couple blocks that way.
Yeah.
Look, you got something
you gotta do...
and a lot can happen
between then and now.
Let's just leave it here, okay?
Don't you be in love with me,
Charlie Swift.
Too late.
I know where your thing is.
Beggar's bar.
Rollo used to manage it.
Last thing he said to me was
it's right under their noses.
All right. Got it?
Where is he, Ronnie?
Where's that weasel?
- I know he's hiding here somewhere.
- Marcie.
- Where is he hiding?
- Um, Rollo?
- Marcie, Rollo's dea...
- You're a shitty liar.
You always were.
You back there, Rollo?
You pull a gun on me again,
and I'll shove it up your ass!
Where are you hiding,
you piece of shit?
You were sleeping up there? Huh?
Come on, I got bills to pay!
Come on!
Face me, you coward!
If you see that cum stain,
you tell him
he better give me my 50 grand,
or I'll cut his dick off.
- Wait, what's the rush, Marcie?
- I think Beggar's looking for you.
- Fuck off me!
- Won't you hang tight while I give him a call?
Let me go, you dick!
Step away from the lady.
I don't see no lady here.
Look again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hands, now, hands, hands.
Nice and easy. There you go.
You go back to the safe house.
I'll disable this crew.
Yeah. Hold onto this for me.
Nice and easy. Up.
Get your ass up!
Back up into the bar.
Down. Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!
Now, can any of you dumb fucks
count to ten?
'Cause that's how many rounds
I have.
Which means one of you
might just get out of here
alive.
Only one that's gonna
get deceased is you.
I'd do you right here, let these
fucking clowns clean up the mess,
but Beggar wants to feed you
to the gators himself.
Just you and him.
He'll have a lot to chew on.
You exclusive to Beggar?
Next exit.
Is he dead?
I'm calling the cops...
Come on, Marcie. Come on.
This is Marcie
Kramer, taxidermist.
- Please leave your message.
- Shit.
Yes, Marcie? Are you okay?
You just won't die, will you?
Your old dumping grounds.
You got one hour
before I shoot her in the head.
You piece of fucking shit.
Stop right there!
Put your
hands where I can see them.
Always thought
my life would end like this.
From a bullet
I didn't see coming.
Shirt off!
I just never thought I'd care.
Only, I did care.
I'm okay, Charlie. Don't worry.
Pants off!
Come on, motherfucker.
So, I was gonna
have to pull off a magic trick
with nothing up my sleeve
or down my pants.
Keep your hands up!
Turn around! Slow!
Impossible, right?
Okay, okay, okay. Take it easy.
Fifteen
seconds to give me that disc.
Think again.
Her first.
The next one's in her neck.
- Ten!
- I need to know she's okay.
- What happened?
- Bitch didn't come quietly when I asked her to.
- You okay?
- Just give him the disc.
I was thinking about the houses,
the fixer-uppers in Italy.
Why I didn't pull the trigger
on one.
I was waiting for someone
to come with me.
You know,
didn't see the point in...
living that kind of dream
all alone.
You got five seconds, Romeo!
You can have the disc.
Only, there's a small problem.
I ain't the one
with the problem.
Yeah, you are.
One of Sal's dudes
in Baton Rouge,
bringing in some shit
on Tuesday night.
Here's the name of the boat
it's coming in on.
Been ratting you out
to the Feds for years.
I'm his money maker.
I'm gonna take this shit down
piece by piece,
'til I'm the man.
I had to run it by Sal,
make sure he was okay
with me killing you.
Marcie?
What's that on your shoe?
Oh!
Much appreciated, Milt.
Semper fi, brother.
Sorry about the drama.
Here you go, get you untied.
All good.
- Who's that?
- Oh, nobody.
Oh. Wait, what's this?
Well, it's a start.
It's Italian.
- It's...
- 'Kay.

Mr. Greene,
someone's here to see you, sir.
That's a smart bet right there.
- That's fucking Charlie.
- Hey there.
Where you been?
I've been calling you.
I know, I know, I know, I, uh...
I been taking care
of that business
- we talked about, Stan.
- Stan?
I thought you said
you were the last one.
Well, I said
it would appear that way.
Paulie, the
chauffeur, got off his shot.
An old pal at the coroner's
office took care of the rest.
Stan Mullen was officially dead.
Now, who is she?
This is Marcie.
- Marcie?
- I'm a friend of Charlie's.
You wanna hear something?
Now...
You know, I... I... I...
I don't know...
I don't know how I got here.
- Really?
- Yeah.
We were watching the game.
Now, you don't wrestle
with a pig.
He'll get you dirty,
and he'll like it.
- All right.
- Stay away from that bum.
No good.
Why don't we take
a little road trip?
- Wow.
- Yeah. Look at this.
It's pretty nice.
It oughta be.
You bought and paid for it.
Put his meds
on the kitchen table.
- Give him three in the morning.
- I got it from here, Charlie.
He's in good hands.
- So, I'm retired?
- Yeah.
- Just like you said you would.
- I'm retired now.
To retirement.
Let's drink to that.
To retirement...
and, uh, the crew?
Yeah, they're good. They're good.
- Charlie.
- Hey, Giselle.
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Greene.
The shuttle for the track
will be here in ten minutes.
For whatever reason, they call me
Mr. Greene down here.
Hey, you two,
when you're in the neighborhood,
stop over, please.
We'll watch the game
or something.
You can count on it.
I love you, big guy.
I like your new wheels.
- What's this?
- 50K.
Courtesy of Sal,
for taking care
of the Beggar situation.
Figured you deserved it.
You can get certified and all.
Certified. Right.
Or we could buy appliances.
I bet those houses in Italy
don't come furnished.
You think so?
Pull the trigger, Charlie.
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
The museum in Tuscany?
Has an open spot
for a taxidermist.
