What else?
- Yes.
- Genetics.
Ever since we are able to
analyze DNA molecules,
we found that the discrepancy
between their molecules and ours
is just of one percent.  That means
that from a genetic point of view,
there is a bigger difference between say
a wolf and a German Shepherd dog than
between...  that monkey and me.
Any other suggestions? No? All right.
in such circumstances, we no longer have
any reason to feel guilty.
Okay, go ahead!
Get him out of his cage and
bring him here.
So what should we conclude from all this?
That nothing separates us
from the apes.
That the superiority of the human species
over all others is a myth.
That all our theories about man and his
relation to the universe
are based on a series of assumptions...
"To civilize" is the act of promoting
the passage of a primitive society
to a more developed stage of its evolution.
The equivalent of 30,000 years
of our history.
30,000 years of the history of
human evolution.
I ask you to read Desmond...
and Grevin...
(Grumble)
Hello!
(Grumble)
Is that okay?
You don't even know my name!
Er, tell me!
Fine.
Pleased to meet you.
Yes, apparently, in the last century
it was a smugglers' lair.
Now it's a zoo.
If they had seen the animals run free
they'd have had a heart attack.
Link, I think the lady does not
understand very well.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the animal right in front of your eyes
has just achieved an amazing performance.
You think that smoking is a performance?
No!  Mastering fire!
All animals are afraid of fire!
Man is the only one to have mastered it
and in doing so,
he inaugurated the start of civilization.
Then he realized he could work the iron
and make tools
and more effective weapons.
It was the Iron Age and the Bronze Age,
steam engines, the industrial revolution
and so on until today.
I thought you had read...
"Back to the Trees".
I said I have read it, not that I agreed.
All right.  Then can I know your
enlightened opinion?
Can I know what do you disagree with
in the thesis I present in my book?
You know, it's been a while since I read it.
I guess.  You were about five years old
when the book was published.
Why haven't you written anything since then?
Answer my question first.
All right.
I think...
that people of my generation...
I mean that one of the reasons that pushed
me to come here, to leave my country,
was that I wanted, before that some mad
scientists blow up the planet, to live.
Because I don't have the impression that
we really have mastered fire.
Do you think nuclear weapons are one more
proof that we are mastering fire?
Yes, without a doubt.
And yet, we do not control them.
It is they who govern us.
Man is not only narrow minded but also
stupid and violent
and he's the one that will
screw up the planet.
What's wrong with you all?
The youth thinks that man is a
monster and the world an inferno.
Geez, the bomb was invented only
40 years ago!
As for this table, it was already
two hundred years old
when your country signed the
Declaration of Independence.
Then you come here and talk
about the end of the world!
Besides, if you are sure that
scientists will kill you,
do something to stop them!
The only problem is that we can't
disinvent technology
and if the man can't have
control over it, who can?
The chimpanzees?
Anyway, they can't do worse than us.
Nonsense!
You know absolutely nothing
about chimpanzees
and apparently even less of
your fellow human beings.
Well, if I want to work tomorrow
I must go to bed.
Good night.
What did I say?
Cheers!
Sorry, I should have knocked...
Hmm, I came to make peace.
This is my book.
I...
I signed it.
Thank you.
We haven't started off on the right foot.
My wife used to say that I was unbearable...
when I was drunk.
It doesn't matter.
My wife let me down.
Deep down I understand her.
A tall and hairy scientist
with shares in a reserve...
fled with her in his Range Rover.
Land Rover...  Range Rover?
I'm sorry.
Me too.
Well, it's getting late, I think
I'd better go to sleep.
Good night.
She closed the door!
Frankly...
Ah! Those females of the dominant species!
All right.  Good night old boy!

square, circle, triangle
This young chimpanzee is the most
trained to these tests in the world.
Any average four years old child
would do better in a few days.
And you, you come here,
you know nothing of the procedure
and of course you defeat our
hairy cousin hands down.
Maybe he did not want to
play with abstract forms.
Fruit! I also have fruit!
Look!
Plastic fruit.
More plastic fruit.
I even tried with real ones.
He had the right to eat one
when he gave the good answer.
The truth is simple.  He can not.
Because the gap between man and ape
is measured in millions of light-years
And all the beautiful and generous romantic
ideas won't change anything about it.
Link, it's very dangerous, you
are going to blow us all up!
You don't know how to use an oven!
Imp, come!
Imp, I must go down into town.
I will look for a car.
No Imp, get up, come on.
Now listen, listen to me!
I'll look for a car, I won't be long.
Then we'll go down into town.
Listen!  As soon as I exit
you lock the door.  Come on!
Get up and look over here.  Come on!
Okay, you understood?
As soon as I exit you lock the door
like this.  All right?
And when I get back, but only
when I tell you,
you open the door like that.  Understood?
Go ahead, try.
You close and you open.  Okay?
But only when I tell you.
Now, lock the door!
And you open it only when I tell you.
Imp, where are you?
Come on!
I hope it will start.
I must take you to the hospital.
