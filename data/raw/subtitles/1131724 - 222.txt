Dylan:  When you fly
 above New York at night
 it's like you're looking down
 at millions of stars.
 And each star
 could be the life of a person
who calls this great city home.
 My dad told me
 that people have always looked
 at the patterns of the stars
 to predict what was going to
 happen in their lives,
 and if you could understand
 those patterns,
 you'd be able to know
 what was gonna happen
 before anyone else did.
The last time we saw each other
 he told me that each star's
 light has taken decades
 to reach us
 and how it always burns
brightest right before it dies.
 So now, whenever
 a distant star lights up,
 I always feel like somewhere,
 somehow,
someone's life is about to end.
Man:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Woman: I've missed you.
Man: Stop it right there!
Put down your weapon!
Dylan:  Ever had
 a dream that felt real?
 So real, you thought
 you were awake.
Man:  Tonight,
 new yorkers
 have the opportunity
 to see a highly unusual
 event above our city.
 Ashley gains reports.
Ashley: For the next two weeks,
 we will be able to witness
 a star going Nova.
 The distant star,
 known as hamil,
 actually died 30 years ago
 but it has taken that long
 for the light to reach us,
 so that...
- Morning, Nicky.
- Hey.
Man: Taxi?
Man: Hey!
- Woman: You sure about that?
- Here, look.
Man: Alright!
Woman:  This is a
 non-rockaway-bound a train.
Dylan:  I like order.
 It somehow soothes me.
 Even in the stressful world
 of air traffic control.
 For me, it's a game
 to find order in the chaos.
Aa 7349, wind 360 at 15.
Line up runway 4 left,
clear for take-off.
Good day to you, sir.
Pilot:

 Good day
 right back at you, sir.
A lot of metal in the air
today, people.
Let's focus, alright?
Ha 399 taxi via delta, Alpha
and hold short of Juliet.

Pilot: Ca 135

Woman: Okay, here's
the first lot of 10 downstairs
that are going to be jammed up
for the next half-hour.
I know you love a bit of chaos.
Ea 39, square the base,
reduce to minimum speed now.
Pilot: Ea 39
 squaring the base,
 reducing to minimum speed.
 Pulling her right back.
Don't make me look bad.
You send that metal bitch
around
and you owe 10 bucks
to the drinking fund.
Pilot: Awaiting final landing
 instructions.
Dylan:  Three,
 two, one, ca 135 takes off...
 Ua 39 lands.
Damn!
Attaboy.
Okay, we all know
that he never comes out.
But the poor bastard's about
to turn 30 in two weeks
and god knows when we'll lure
him out for another drink.
Here's to the end of youth,
pal.
We love you, dyl.
- Wow.
- I don't.
Thanks, you guys.
Especially inky for those
incredibly moving words.
I'm a sentimental guy.
Who's up for a smoke?
Ooh, you talked me into it.
Bill?
Hey, I thought you'd quit.
Oh, yeah, I did. Many times.
- Woman: Bill!
- I hear you!
You wanna get some air?
Sure.
So, happy birthday.
Mm! Really?
- Mm-hm.
- It's one of those?
Mm-hm.
So, our tradition continues,
huh?
You bet it does.
Aerial ballet?
Is that something
you can't handle?
It's fine.
- Great.
- Yep.
- And you're coming with me.
- No, I'm not.
- Why not?
- Definitely not.
Well, I'm...
I'm seeing someone...
Who is quite normal.
It makes for a nice change.
- Ha!
- Mm.
Guess we were never right
for each other, were we?
No, not even close.
Seriously, who am I supposed
to bring to this thing?
I don't know.
But I hope you find her one day.
Dylan:  They
 say people are unpredictable.
 But really,
 we all love routine.
- Morning, Nicky.
- Hey.
Dylan:
 Me? I like seeing patterns.
 Patterns in everyday routines.
 Astrological experts
 have not seen
 such intense activity...
Can I help you?!
Hey, people, come on.
Let's clear these boards.
What's going on?
Ya 950, hold short 22 right.
You're number two to go.
Pilot: Ya 950 holding short,

Pilot 2: Aa 41 awaiting
 final take-off instructions.
Dylan: Aa 41, winds 010 at 10,

Pilot: Aa 41 cleared for

Flight attendant: Sir, you need
to fasten your seatbelt.
Thank you.
Over pa: This is your captain
 speaking.
 Due to cloud cover
 over the tri-state area
 we may experience
 slight turbulence
 leading into our descent.
Qa 856, departure 23, 9.
Good day to you, sir.
Pilot: Qa 856, good day
 right back to you, mate.
Bill: That yankee's your bird,
right?
- Mm-hm.
- You wanna tell him something?
Ga 1165, 787 rolling.
Caution with turbulence.

- Dylan!
- What?
- You didn't hold 'em?
- Yankee? Ah...
Dude, what are you doing?
Pilot: Kennedy tower,
 are we still clear to land?
Pilot: Kennedy tower,
 are we still...
I want you to get yankee
the hell out of there.
Dylan!
Bill: Tell him to pull up!
Sa 841, clear to land.
Clear to land.
Ga 950, punch it.
Woman: Oh, my god!
Inky: Wicked!
Oh, my god!
Pilot: Can someone, anyone,
 please respond?
Bill: Ga 950...
Woman: Your father
was a pilot.
Retired air force, yes.
You graduated
top of your class at nyu.
Mm-hm.
It was a great day for my dad.
You got your pilot's license,
so why are you landing
commercial jets
and not flying them
like he did?
Because I'm not him.
I only aced those tests
because they were based on
a rotating series of
algorithmic patterns.
You see patterns?
I guess.
But just not today.
You're suspended,
pending a full board review.
How long?
Four weeks and a board review.
I'm sorry, dyl.
- It could have been worse.
- It should have been worse.
I almost killed 900 people.
Dylan: Emirates 433.
Man: What are you doin'?
Man:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Woman:
 Your attention, please.
 Safety is our first priority.
 Please remain calm.
Um, hi.
I'm sorry.
There you go.
Thank you.
Hey, maybe next time
you can try the one with the
dancing mice and the fairies.
 The nutcracker.
Yeah, that one.
- I'm Dylan.
- Did you like...?
- Uh...
Did you enjoy
the aerial ballet?
Yeah, I loved it.
It was incredible.
You seem surprised.
It's my first time
at the ballet.
A friend kind of
dared me to go.
Would you like a drink?
Uh...
Or not.
I'd prefer
to get out of here...
Actually.
With me?
Yeah.
- Oh, that's great!
I'm Sarah - in case
you wanted to know my name.
Well, I kinda wanted to know.
Come on.
- Sarah: So your first time?
- Dylan: Yeah.
Wasn't what I expected.
Sarah: No bulging tights.
Oh, mercifully no.
It was more... more epic.
Or... um, intimate.
Or... both.
Yeah, or both. I don't know.
You know, it
kind of reminded me
of this feeling
I'd get as a kid.
I'd wait until
everyone had gone to bed,
and then I'd climb on to
the roof to look at the stars.
Because my dad was a pilot,
so whenever
i saw a flashing star,
I'd pretend it was him
flying across the sky
and I knew he'd be
looking down at me.
And if I was really lucky,
I'd see a shooting star
and I'd wish he'd come home.
Oh. I love that.
Did you ever want to do that?
Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, I did.
Okay.
Then why are you not a pilot?
Because I'm afraid to fly.
- Really?
- Didn't really work.
- Wow.
- Dylan: Scared to death.
Sarah: Right.
Tell me something about you.
What do you do?
I... I work at the
Howard pace gallery downtown.
Totally would have
guessed that.
- Sarah: No! Really?
- Mm-hm.
Well, it's funny. I never...
I don't know,
i never saw myself
working in an art gallery.
Well, what did you want to be?
A dancer.
Dylan: The other day at work,
i made a mistake.
I lost my flow.
And, um... you know,
there was... there was one plane
that was about to land,
and another one
about to take off.
Something happened.
I nearly killed 900 people.
The plane that was coming in...
What flight was it?
As841 from O'Hare.
Are you okay?
That was my flight.
Dylan: What?
I was on that flight.
Oh, I... I nearly killed you.
No. You saved me.
Man: Sorry, guys.
We're closing.
Dylan: Um... no.
- Can we get one more drink?
- Sarah: Yeah. Just ...
I know we only just met,
but doesn't it...
Dylan: Feel like we've known
each other forever?
I was actually going to say
it feels a little more intense
than your typical first date.
I had
a really good time tonight.
- How are you doing?
- Oh, yeah, I'm great.
Did you want to help me out,
or...?
You know, you're not actually
creating the art.
You're just doing the
background.
It's all about the background,
Sarah.
Okay.
Major rendering meltdown.
Howard, stop texting me.
Jonas! How's my favorite
mad artist this morning?
I'm trying to create
and you're stressing me out.
Well, just make it incredible.
Because art is that easy.
Sarah: Okay. Hey.
I suppose
you want a coffee too?
Jonas: Soy latte
with an extra shot?
Thank you.
Benny: Don't worry about me,
guys. I'm on a cleanse.
How was it? The ballet?
It was beautiful. It was, um...
Yeah, it was...
It was really nice.
It wasn't anything religious,
but...
Bullshit - it was religious.
You're glowing.
Thank you.
Um... okay!
It looks good.
Dylan: Emirates 443.
Hello?
Woman: Hello.
 Is Dylan Branson there?
Yeah?
Woman: Is this Dylan Branson
 of 818 east 12th street?
Man 1: Hey! What the hell
is wrong with you, man?
You cut me off!
Man 2:
I can't believe this shit!
Man 1: Are you kidding me?
I'm cruising down my bike Lane
and you come clip me off?
Pick up your bike
and get on your way.
Uh, I'm sorry. Who's this?
Woman: Regina Jones
 from grand central.
Yep. It was found
on the subway last night.
- It's your lucky day.
- Thanks.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Man: I've missed you.
Woman: Bobby, stay in line!
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Regina:
 Please remain calm.
Hi.
I'm sorry. Did I, uh...
Hi.
Oh.
Oh...
God, that looked so much better
when I picked it.
It actually had petals.
- Okay. Yeah.
- Dylan: I'm sorry.
Sarah: No, no, no, no!
I want it. It's, uh...
It... it... it smells great.
Hey, would you like
to do dinner again?
I...
It's a little early,
don't you think?
Sarah: So do you want
the short story or the long?
- Dylan: No, short.
- Sarah: Okay.
- Dylan: I don't got all day.
- - Sarah: Okay. Okay.
Um... well, I started dancing
when I was seven...
And for me, it was
really kind of the only thing
that really, like,
felt like me, you know?
And halfway through
my senior year,
I got offered an apprenticeship
at the New York City ballet...
- Dylan: Mm-hm?
- ...Which of course I took.
Six months into being there,
i, um...
I landed awkwardly
on a jump that I had done
a hundred times before...
And I busted my knee.
I shredded two ligaments.
- And, um...
- Wow.
I don't know. It was over.
You know what?
Stuff like that...
I think it all happens
for a reason.
If it's meant to be, it's meant
to be. Can I have that?
- The paper?
- Yeah.
Watch this.
I guess
I'm the pilot that can't fly.
You're the dancer
that can't dance.
Or can you?
- Sarah: What?
- Dylan: Come on.
Sarah:
What are you doing?
Dylan: What does it look like?
So come and help me out.
Come on - just don't leave me
standing here.
- Come on.
- No.
- Come on. Put it down.
- Oh, god.
Wait.
Oh, I don't think
I'm ready for this.
Come on.
You see it?
Wow.
Dylan:
What time do you work today?
Sarah: Three hours ago.
Yeah.
Dylan: What's this?
Sarah: This?
It's pretty.
Thanks. It's cool.
A friend made it for me
for my birthday.
A friend?
A boyfriend.
- An ex-boyfriend.
- Oh, thank god.
- That's good.
- I know.
- That's the good news.
- I know.
He's actually...
I don't think you're going
to like this very much, but...
He is actually the artist
who's showing at the gallery.
Oh, I love it. That's great.
Sarah: It's great.
I just better make sure
i do something that competes.
- Oh, okay.
- When is your birthday?
Next week. The 18th.
Are you kidding?
No. Why?
- 18th?
- Yeah.
- What year?
- 1986.
No, seriously? 1986?
- Yes!
- April 18th?
- 1986.
- That's nuts.
- That's my birthday.
- Oh, whatever.
- I swear.
- Okay.
- I swear.
- You are out of control.
I swear!
We're both turning 30 next week.
I don't believe you.
You're a liar.
Man: Hell!
What is the matter with you?
Woman:
Oh, do you have eyes?
- Can you drive?
- Man: How did you ...?
- It doesn't matter!
- Woman: It does matter.
Man: Why were you in the road?
Wow.
That's the third day in a row.
Benny: Sarah, question.
- Too much?
- No, I love it.
Are we good to do tech checks?
Do I look like
we're good to do tech checks?
Jonas, we open Friday night.
I'm not doing it cold.
It'll be ready.
Why do you always
do this to me?
Because you love it.
Benny: Okay, I'm bored now.
You smell good.
- It's the pheromones.
- Benny!
She's in love.
No, she's not in love.
Benny:
She's definitely in lust.
Guys, stop!
You are, aren't you?
I don't want to talk about it.
We are not even close
to being ready.
I'm happy for you.
No, you're not.
Just hope he knows
how lucky he is.
Driver:
Come on!
Woman: Yeah, I've seen them,
you know.
Man: Hey, man,
why didn't you stop?
Which way are you going?
No worry. Is faster.
Woman: Yeah.
- No.
- Man: Can I help you with that?
Um... don't go this way, okay?
We're heading towards
grand central.
- No, is good.
- No, no - let's not do this.
Just stop the cab.
What your problem?
- Just stop the cab, okay?
- Driver: No yelling!
Stop the cab
and let me out, please!
No yelling!
I tell you no yelling at me!
Man: Okay. Help 'em out!
Give me a hand!
Okay, pull!
Hey, buddy - you okay?
Hey, let me help you out.
Hey,
somebody call an ambulance!
Ah!
Sarah: Hey.
 Take this off.
Dylan: This is going to
 sound ridiculous, okay?
But I... I keep seeing the same
people for three days in a row,
at grand central.
A businessman
reads a newspaper.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Dylan: A couple hugs.
Man: I've missed you.
Dylan: There's, uh...
 And these kids
 are crossing the concourse.
One drops something.
 For three days in a row,
a pregnant woman
under the clock.
It's...
 At exactly 2:22.
Boom.
Woman:
 Your attention, please.
 Your safety is
 our first priority.
 Please remain calm.
Sarah: You're okay.
Man: Taxi?
- Morning, Nicky.
- How you doin'?
Dylan:
 Every little thing matters.
 A drop of water.
 A dead bug.
 A plane flies overhead
 at 11:15.
 It's all part
 of some kind of pattern.
- Man: Can I help you with that?
- Woman: Thank you.
Man: Step back!
Man: Ga 554, taxi,
papa, November, Alpha.
Dylan: I think I'm losing it.
Inky: They're shrinks. They're
paid to think you're losing it.
Yeah, things are happening
to me, inky.
Things that cannot possibly
be explained.
What can I do?
I don't know.
Nothing.
Call me, yeah?
Yeah.
We'll do something
on your birthday.
Only three days left, dyl.
Make the most of 'em.
"9:10. Drip."
Not today.
Drip?
Really?
Drip!
Ahh...
Three, two...
What the fuck?
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Woman: I've missed you.
Man: Hey, there you are.
Yep.
Alright, can I lead you
over to...
You can tell me what you think.
Have you seen him?
- No, okay.
- He is on the move. Yep.
- Lovely to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're all here
to experience the work
of one of our most exciting
contemporary artists -
Mr. Jonas edman, with his latest
tribute to this great city.
Tonight I present you
the opening of... convergence.
Hi.
Hi.
Excuse me, ladies.
Sarah.
- Let's go.
- Hey.
- Man: We're good to go.
- Jonas: Let's do it.
Okay. Never again.
- Showtime.
- Come on.
Dylan, this is Jonas.
Hi.
Hi.
Okay.
Ready?
Three, two, one... go.
Jonas: Nothing is as eternal
 as a city.
 And you are my eternal love,
 the city of all cities.
 Pavemented, walled,
 lit, jeweled.
 Crowded city of beauty.
 Of shadows and geometric
 shapes never ending.
 Your windows reflect memories
 none of us can keep.
 Moments, they slip away,
 a whisper in our sleep.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
 Your arms hold the sky,
 reflecting in truth.
 Where god and men meet
 in our reverence to you.
Is this some kind of sick joke?
What?
What are you doing?
Have you been following me?
- What is this?
- Whoa, attention, bro.
How long have you been
doing this?
- What is going on here, man?
- What are you doing?
- Dylan!
- Have you been following me?
What is this?
What are you doing?
Jonas!
- Why would you do this?
- Get off me!
Hey, hey, hey! Let him go!
Let go of me!
Get off of me!
What are you doing?
Stop.
Bravo. Bravo.
I love this, Jonas.
A nice morbid tale
to button the exhibit.
I have another amazing
interpretation in my gallery,
you know.
What?
I love how you blended
the victims in so elegantly.
A moment before the murders.
It's really stunning.
What is he talking about?
I have no idea.
The photograph...
Of the murder scene.
Come on, time to leave.
What is wrong with you?
What is that?
You know Jonas
is the most important artist
in this exhibit.
Yes, and he's your
ex-boyfriend.
How... how's this possible?
That hologram
is the exact replica
of what I've been seeing.
This is crazy.
How is this possible?
How does he know?
You know, I can't actually have
this conversation right now.
Let yourself out.
- Sarah.
- Sarah.
Sarah: Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what happened.
Sarah: Dylan, this is Jonas.
Woman:  The energetic
 force of the exploding Hamlin
 will be at its greatest
 in the next two days.
 This is a very rare event...
Woman: ...The massive
 lifespan of the average star.
"Jake redmond."
Letters to this address.
"My dear Jake,
I just got your letter
and I can't stop grinning
from ear to ear."
Man:
 Um, Sarah, it's Dylan. Um...
 I'm so sorry about last night.
 I...
 This thing with Jonas and the
hologram just really got to me.
 Please call me, okay?
Man:
The next stop is grand central.
 Grand central.
Man: Thought you might
drop by.
So there's the killer with
the gun in his hand.
He shot a woman and a police
detective in broad daylight
before he was gunned down
by the cops.
A tourist from Cleveland took
the original photograph...
And the artist has taken
that image and...
Created this piece.
Stay as long as you like.
Dylan: "Multiple
homicides at grand central.
"...criminal Jake redmond."
No, not it.
Here it is.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
 "Jake redmond.
 Born April 18th 1956."
Woman: Who is it?
It's Dylan Branson.
We spoke over the phone.
Woman: I'll buzz you in.
Where did you get these?
In my apartment.
They were hidden.
And why did you come here?
Dylan: I don't know.
 I feel a connection to her.
Woman: You want to talk
 about connection?
She was my sister.
She was the kindest person.
She had a voice like an angel
 and she sang at clubs
 all around town
 and that's where she met Jake.
 She thought he was...
 Funny and clever and sweet.
Dylan: Newspapers said
 he was a convicted criminal.
Woman: He was
 never convicted.
 The police had to say that
 to save face.
 I still don't know
 what he was up to.
 It was some kind of...
 Insurance scams
 or racketeering,
 something like that.
 And everyone tried
 to warn her--
 the police, her friends
 and that poor detective
 who died with her.
- Dylan: Noah marks.
- Woman: Yeah.
 I think he was in love
 with her, too.
 She had that effect on men.
 She couldn't see it.
She believed that Jake
was the love of her life.
Did Jake love her
the same way back?
Well, apparently enough to kill
her rather than let her go.
Is that was she was doing
at grand central?
Was she leaving him?
Woman: Detective marks
came to see Evie one night.
 He told her things about Jake
 that she never knew.
 He was a violent man.
 He'd killed a police informer.
 She kept saying,
 "i don't believe it.
 Jake would never hurt anyone."
She said they were destined
to be together.
Even had the same birthday.
He said Jake was a psycho,
that he was dangerous.
And detective marks said that...
He had a place,
somewhere up in, uh...
Millhurst.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Woman: Yeah. Millhurst.
This is what we found
after she...
Take them.
I... I could never bear
to read them.
This is all I need
to remember her by.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Dylan: Hey, Sarah,
 I really need to talk to you.
 These patterns, the things
 I'm seeing, the hologram...
 Us, everything -
 it's all connected.
 Please, call me.
Sarah: For over a week now,
he's ended up right here
at grand central.
What made you do this?
It's grand central.
It's iconic New York.
 I've been working on
 this thing for eight months,
 way before you
 met your... boyfriend.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Sarah: Yeah,
 but the same people.
I mean, the... the businessman,
 the couple hugging...
Hey, I've missed you.
Sarah: ...The school children...
...the pregnant woman.
He... he sees them. He sees...
The same people.
He described all of them.
Jonas:
The same people?
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Sarah: Well, not the exact
 same people but the...
 I don't know,
 the same type of people.
He... he thinks it's a pattern.
Seriously?
A businessman in a train
station is a pattern?
I don't know.
You know what they call people
who see patterns in everything?
- Hi.
- Can I help you?
Yeah, um...
The millhurst express.
Bit of news for you.
The millhurst express...
Ain't run
for nearly three decades now.
What?
Station announcer:
 The poughkeepsie express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Man: Look out!
Station announcer:
 Your attention please.
 Your safety
 is our first priority.
 Please remain calm.
Thanks for coming.
Hey, I'm tired and...
I'm so sorry, Sarah.
I'm so sorry.
Hey. Hey.
Are you okay?
What's really going on?
Dylan: I... I know
what this looks like.
I get it.
How long
have you been doing this?
Just a couple of days.
Well... since the day at jfk,
really.
It was like I saw the sky
cracking open.
I saw right through it.
Now look at this.
His name's Jake redmond,
right?
He was a killer. He was...
- I see.
- And this is Evelyn mills.
She was a singer.
And they died at grand central
30 years ago tomorrow,
the day you and I were born.
We're them.
- No.
- Look at this. Look at this.
Look. Look.
I wrote these letters to you.
And you...
Wrote these to me.
A lifetime ago.
Look. Look at this.
Look at them.
It's all happening again.
- No, I...
- I know. I don't understand.
- I...
- I don't... I don't ...
I don't... I don't want to know
what is in them.
Your patterns...
These letters...
They don't mean anything.
They mean everything.
You've gotta understand...
No, you need to understand.
It is grand central.
I could go there any time
of day and find these people
if that's what
i was looking for.
All these patterns
that you think exist...
They're just people.
No.
You live in a city
of 8 million.
Of course they're going to be
doing similar things.
You hear that?
Dog barking.
Telephone ringing.
Airplane. Baby crying.
- Car horn.
Car horn.
It is New York City
and it is all happening.
It is all happening,
all of the time.
Please don't do this.
Please.
When I'm with you
i feel something so special.
Just stop it.
Don't you get it?
She dies. He kills her.
This is us.
We die tomorrow, Sarah.
We need to end this now
for your own good.
Sarah: No.
We can not
see each other again.
- Don't do this to us.
- Go!
Please go.
Man: Can I help you?
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Woman: I've missed you.
Man: Can I help you with that?
Yeah?
Sarah: Hey, it's me.
I need to know
why grand central.
You both have this connection.
It's a coincidence.
He doesn't believe in that.
Or therapy, apparently.
Sarah, this has to stop.
You can't keep
doing this to us.
To yourself. It's...
It's destructive.
I'm going to take you away
for a few days.
You saw the way
he looked at me.
He wanted to kill me.
He is out of control, Sarah.
You're not safe here.
I mean it.
I love him.
I love him so much.
I don't know what it is,
we just have this connection.
Constellations.
A map of the heavens.
Man:
 ...Electromagnetic shifts
 in the earth's atmosphere.
Man:  Einstein's theory
 of relativity...
Happy birthday.
Man:  Scientists believe
 the electromagnetic field
 around the earth
 is being affected
 by the supernova
 from the dying star, hamil.
 So more and more
 we're able to confirm
 just how alive and effectible
 our world truly is.
 Even an exploding star
 30 light years away
 causes our planet
 to adjust and react
 as its light
 actually reaches us.
 Science is starting to...
Dylan: What am I missing?
Man:  What appears to
 be a star dying to us now
 actually happened
 30 years ago.
 So when we look into
 the distant night sky
 we are not just seeing
 the reaches of the universe,
 we are quite literally
 looking back in time itself.
Dylan: Back in time.
Man: Can I help you with that?
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Woman: I've missed you.
Dylan: I'm seeing the day I die.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You good?
Yeah.
Jfk, please.
Dylan: A woman laughs.
Dylan: Can I help you
with that?
Can I help you with that?
Thank you. Thank you so much.
Bell.
Follow the bell.
Dylan: Door slams.
Jonas: Hey.
A couple of days in millhurst
will do you wonders.
Sarah.
No.
Jonas.
You're Noah marks.
Just don't answer it.
Sarah, where are you?
Just pick up the phone.
Jonas: Shit.
What?
Our flight's been cancelled.
Change of plan.
We're going to grand central.
Dylan: Siren.
2:15. Jackhammer.
Man: Alright, swinging it back.
Gonna get the tickets.
Meet you at the clock.
Okay.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Dylan: Car horn.
Man: Hey!
What's your problem?
Man: Sir!
Sir, get down off the vehicle!
Dylan: Sarah, where are you?
I know what the patterns are.
I'm seeing the day we die.
Two tickets
to millhurst please.
What?
Millhurst.
30 years ago maybe.
Poughkeepsie will get you there.
That'll be $52.
Poughkeepsie.
Hands behind your back, sir.
Okay.
Dylan: 2:17. Glass shatters.
Policeman: Why you jumping
on the car?
Sir, just stop right there.
Put your hands
behind your back...
- People are gonna die, man!
- Nobody's gonna die, sir.
Give me the hands.
Come on!
Policeman: Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Right, drop the weapon!
Okay, okay.
That's it.
Lower it to the ground.
- I'm warning you.
- Alright.
- Put the weapon down.
- Letting it go.
Dylan: Three.
 Two.
 One.
Policeman: Heads down!
Get out of the way!
There we go.
Two tickets to poughkeepsie.
I thought you said
we were going to millhurst.
What are you talking about?
You ready?
I'm sorry.
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait, what's wrong?
- Take your hands off me.
- What?
Stay away from me.
Policeman: Stop!
You love me, Evelyn.
You just called me Evelyn.
But you love me.
I don't.
- Say it.
- No.
Say it!
- Tell me you love me!
- No.
Dylan: Sarah!
You brought him here?
You brought him here?
Dylan: A businessman.
A businessman.
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
A couple hugs.
Dylan: A couple hugs.
Man: I missed you.
There's always
a row of schoolchildren.
And a pregnant woman...
Standing under the clock.
Man: Get out of here!
She'll never be yours.
No!
Oh, god! Oh, god!
No!
Policeman: Put the weapon down!
Freeze! Drop your weapon now!
Station announcer:
 The millhurst express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Station announcer:
 The poughkeepsie express
 is now boarding on track 32.
Boom.
No!
No! No!
Sarah: No.
Dylan: A star shines
brightest right before it dies.
God.
Dylan: The sun's coming out
 for us.
- I want more of you.
- You want more of me?
Dylan: All these years, history
 said Jake was a murderer,
 when in fact he was framed by
 the cops to protect their own.
 And in the end, only
 love could reveal the truth.
Woman: "My dear Jake,
 I just got your letter
 and I can't stop smiling
 from ear to ear.
 I don't understand
 why I'm feeling...
 ...the way I am
 so quickly.
 I just never believed
a love like this was possible."
Hi.
It's 2:23.
We made it.
Dylan: So as expected,
 the dying star Hamlin
 did finally disappear.
 But somewhere, somehow
 another star
 was born right after.
 Dad's predictions all those
years ago did finally play out.
 He was right when he said
 in everyone's life
 there comes a time
 or, in my case, many times...
 When the universe opens
 itself for just a few moments
 to show us
 what's truly possible.
11:15.
No plane.
