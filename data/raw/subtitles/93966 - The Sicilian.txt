- ls he better?
- l think so.
- But with tuberculosis ...
- And he still smokes.
That's marvellous.
Now l want a bath.
What is it?
That was my uncle Dominic.
His last wish was
to be buried in Montelepre.
He was a true saint.
He fell off a ladder yesterday.
A permission for the funeral?
- He fell on his head and ...
- Certificate ...
... for the mules?
ldentification?
Run!
Giuliano!
Out of the way!
Those horses must
go backto the stables!
l'm riding like
Billy the Kid, you son of a bitch.
You're hit!
You'll bleed to death.
Good morning, captain.
- Duchess.
- Were those two from our village?
Yes, Montelepre. Young Giuliano
just killed one of my men.
We caught them stealing.
Giuliano and his cousin.
- Doing what?
- They steal grain for Montelepre.
- They sell it in the village?
- lt's given to those who refuse work.
Will you sign this complaint?
Back in Connecticut
we have an old saying:
- ''Let them eat bread.''
- But they stole your horses.
l'll get them back, captain.
The usual way.
l'm sorry aboutyour man.
A village boy killing an officer!
lt's usually the other way around.
Goodbye, captain.
Giuliano.
- Who fired first? Be honest.
- The police, father.
We had stolen some grain.
lt was Giuliano's idea.
People are starving in Montelepre.
He wanted to give them food.
- Good deeds are punished in Sicily.
- His was.
Can he stay here until he recovers?
No chance of that.
- ls he dying?
- He's not living long.
Not with that hole in him,
and all the blood he lost.
So get the real doctor!
- Even a barber knows death.
- He was such a generous boy.
ls he just going to die like that?
- Because of that lousy bread?
- lt was God's will.
People in Montelepre always
starved and they always will.
He is young and strong.
He won't leave us justyet.
But he will leave us.
l won't leave you ... yet.
Aspanu ...
Go to Giovanna now.
- Tell her l'll come by soon.
- l can't leave you here.
With those ...
Do as l say!
lt's unbelievable, professor.
l cutyour godson's hair
last month. A real crewcut.
And now he's a murderer?
There's a reward out for him.
Terrible.
- Not worse than your haircuts.
- That's unworthy of you.
- Try again.
- l'd rather not.
When your godson contacts you, -
- tell him to surrender.
ls that understood?
l don't take your orders,
and Giuliano doesn't take mine.
- He killed a policeman.
- He wanted to feed the hungry!
That's not his job!
He committed a crime
against the ltalian government.
Sicily is ltalian -
- and l am the mayor of Montelepre,
like it or not!
And just like you, -
- l am a friend
of Don Masino Croce.
- Giuliano is very young.
- And very stupid.
Don Masino orders him
to turn himself in.
Don Masino will pay the usual
compensation to the relatives ...
And Giuliano will be free.
lf he joins Don Masino.
Don Masino always had an eye
on that boy for some reason.
He is wild and unmanageable!
Who wants that?
But ...
He is lucky.
The duchess got her horses back.
You've got blood on your shoe.
l give a bad shave,
you knowthat.
Giuliano?
He's dying, professor.
They say the people
don't want land.
They say the people
only want bread!
But they are wrong. We want to
own the land. lt belongs to us.
That is why we're here.
That's what the law says.
The new law.
Since the last election,
all farmhands on an estate -
- have a right to a share
in the estate's uncultivated land.
He is just one man.
He is controlled
by Prince Borsa and Don Masino.
There are hundreds of you. You
are citizens! The law's with you!
Not them!
- How is he?
- He was shot in the belly.
- He says he'll live.
- Says?
- You don't agree?
- He knows best.
He's safe in the mountains.
He says he will visityou soon.
Why does your brother do this?
- People don't dare to make demands.
- l can't understand that he does.
ls the mayor of Montelepre going to
kill an opponent in the light of day?
You are in the way!
Aspanu!
How did you get in?
You smoke too much.
Giuliano will live.
Thank God.
Or maybe that's premature.
- Don Masino wants him.
- Don Masino can go to hell.
No! We don't speak of him like that.
- He protects us.
- He protects those who pay.
Quintana almost killed Silvio Ferra
in front of Prince Borsa's estate.
Frisella says Giuliano is dying.
lf he was like you and me,
he would die. But he is not.
He has decided to live.
So he will.
l'm off to Palermo.
To steal?
And meet some women.
What else?
- Want to hear something funny?
- lf it is funny. What?
Giuliano is not afraid to die.
- Very funny!
- l thoughtyou'd think so.
''ln their bodies ...
... wasted and aged ...
... sit the souls of old men.''
''The poor things.''
''They endure their sorry lives
in boredom''.
''They tremble lest they lose it,
and howthey dote on it.''
''The confounded and
contradictory souls -
- sit comical, tragical,
in their worn-out hides''.
- Your coffee smells good.
- lt's Brazilian ... Don Masino.
l love Brazilian coffee ...
... so l always drink camomile tea,
which l hate.
My liver has turned traitor.
My son is in Brazil.
He studies insects.
Entomology is very fascinating.
Maybe in your world,
but not in mine.
A bug is a bug.
My son cares for nothing except
the mating rituals of insects.
- Your son is a scholar.
- My son does not exist.
For me, that is.
Don Masino has honoured us
by paying a visit, dear professor.
lt is always a joy
to see you, Don Masino.
Dear old Hector.
Almost none of us left anymore.
- Time ...
- The enemyof man.
- The only winner.
- We need your counsel.
- ln a small matter.
- His nephew wants to be a doctor.
Dr. Nattore finds the nephew lacking
in academical skill.
Don Masino has come
to speak for his nephew.
Don Masino has done so much
fou our university, -
- so a solution should be found.
Any problem usually has a solution.
How wise. Hector knows
that l am not a reader.
As for mathematics, a mystery.
Well, l can add and subtract.
- And divide.
- You flatter me.
But l picked up what l needed to know
in my line of work.
Why can't my nephew do the same?
l beg you not to break
my poor sister's heart.
Please ...
- l'm sorry ...
- My nephew won't hurt anyone.
He can get a job in the army or as
a spiritual adviser in a rest home.
He is so sensitive.
Can't stand the sight of blood.
- My family must be cursed.
- That's part of the problem, sir.
Professor Adonis, Don Masino's
nephew wants to a surgeon.
Your nephew
is a functional illiterate.
Some day he will have to enter
a human body with a knife.
- ln fear of blood.
- l see a way out, Don Masino.
- l propose a compromise.
- No!
Your nephew will get his doctor's
degree, but he will not be a surgeon.
He will get a pharmaceutical book
where he can look up symptoms, -
- and then prescribe a cure.
He will have a wonderful career.
l knowthe boy.
He's a born healer.
l surrender.
So you have defeated me again,
professor Adonis, -
- with your good sense.
So be it. My nephew will be
a doctor, and not a surgeon.
My ambitious sister
... a born surgeon herself, -
- a butcher anyway,
will have to settle for that.
You must resign today.
- You're mad.
- No ... butyou are.
- Why should l leave?
- You have said no to Don Masino.
You can no longer
live in Sicily.
- How are you?
- Have you ever been shot?
- l am Franciscan, not Jesuit.
- Well, firstyou feel shock.
Then comes the pain.
Then the hot blood streams out.
- Suddenly you feel immortal.
- You are.
You are on your way
to your heavenly protector.
You feel like someone else.
Someone untouchable.
Who could ...
The answer to Don Masino,
your earthly protector, is no.
You see, l feel capable of anything.
- Since you were shot?
- Yes, and since l did not die.
As l was supposed to.
Here is Don Masino,
your earthly protector.
Our chief.
The landlords like Prince Borsa,
who pay for Masino's protection.
Here is the church ...
and hope of a heaven.
After death, of course.
- To which of the three do you belong?
- None. l'm over here.
- l am Giuliano.
- ln Sicily you can't stand alone.
- What about the people?
- The people?
They are the dustyou draw in.
Those are the people.
The Sicilians are hopeless.
And l mean that.
Nothing changes here.
Giuliano says no.
He is a romantic.
He wants to buy the land
or give it to the people.
- ls he a communist?
- No.
But he is engaged
to Silvio Ferra's sister.
Our party will have trouble thanks
to Silvio Ferra and his friends.
Where do they come from?
They spring up like mushrooms.
Anyway ...
the minister is frantic.
- My stomach burns.
- The soup is all right.
Your stomach always burns.
The way you stuff yourself, l'm
surprised you still have a stomach.
Mushroom soup ... oh, God.
l know it's poisoned.
Sorry, Enzo.
What about Giuliano?
- He's going to the mountains.
- To become a bandit like Terranova?
No ... he's not going to end up
in prison like that bunch.
- When is their trial?
- Never.
l have decided to free them myself.
Hell, l imagine.
Tell Giuliano to behave.
He is safe under my protection.
What must he do in return?
Like me, that's all.
But if he so much as looks
at a bug, he is a dead man.
- Don Masino is our friend.
- He is not my friend.
- Nor my brother's friend.
- He could be.
l can see him
dividing the land between us.
l hate political women.
So does Giuliano.
- Forget the election for his sake.
- Don't worry. Opposites attract.
You look good.
You look different.
- Hey, a moustache.
- lt excites women.
You should grow one.
- Giovanna?
- She's like a broken record.
She says, ''Giuliano mustn't
work for Don Masino''.
''Don't let him rob the poor.''
We will never rob the poor.
l promise.
- You make a handsome priest.
- Should l become one?
Over my dead body.
How's your brother?
- Do you care?
- Yes.
Ever since
Quintana knocked him down.
Your brother is right, you know,
about the land.
We are in deep shit,
and you talk about politics.
lt's all the same.
- Adonis says you must go up.
- Join the angels.
- Yes, Passatempo and Terranova.
- Don't worry.
- l will visityou down here.
- l am very proud of you.
Because l said no to Don Masino?
Maybe one day l'll say yes.
- To your brother.
- Over my dead body.
- Are you really going with me?
- Yes.
l also want to be an angel.
What do l care for Palermo?
The bright lights ... women!
lf you want to be an angel -
- you've got to change your shoes.
l will never forgive
what they did to you.
- l will pay them back.
- How?
l will save the world, what else?
Don't worry.
l have a plan.
- Be careful.
- All right.
For you.
- Where are they?
- ln the police barracks.
On the Trapani road.
Did you rob a bank?
As a matter of fact, l did.
A small bank.
General! l've gotyour wine.
Wine!
Aspanu Pisciotta!
- Who ordered this wine?
- Commander Roccofino.
- Bring them in.
- You do it. l'm not breaking my back.
- She can help you.
- She's drunk, the bitch.
- She's only good for one thing.
- All right.
Unload it.
Wake up, bitch!
- Drop your belt, corporal.
- So the bitch is Giuliano?
- Don't be insulting, corporal ..?
- Canio ... Silvestro.
Drop the belt.
Unlock your cage, Mr. Silvestro.
Giuliano!
Hands up!
You're free to go.
Or go with me to the mountains.
Get moving.
- Or l'll kick your ass.
- Then l'll kick yours.
Get Terranova and Passatempo.
Sit down, Mr. Silvestro.
Corporal Silvestro.
Aren'tyou too young
to declare war on Rome?
Alexander the Great was not too
young to conquer half the world.
- They called him the ''Sky Flame''.
- Alexander ...
He wasn't a Sicilian.
There's no fire in our heaven.
l am Salvatore Giuliano.
You are both indebted to me.
No!
A miracle!
- Let me kill him.
- No!
Let us respect him.
We don't kill the police.
At least not deliberately.
No sky flame over Sicily?
- Why should they come?
- Because l ought to be dead now.
But l survived for the second time.
They'll come because they know ...
- What?
- That l am special.
- Passatempo is not coming.
- Miracles impress even him.
- Only cash impresses him.
- He will get plenty.
l only ask for his loyalty.
Passatempo killed the uncle
who gave him his first donkey!
Then l'll have to teach him
the meaning of loyalty.
Terranova!
You will get used to the cold up here.
Passatempo!
- Where are your men?
- Where l want them.
Watching you ... and me.
- We are indebted to you.
- How much?
Each of us gets a third
of what we collect.
- Fair enough.
- Butyou follow me.
Understood?
You are a boy!
Butyou are lucky.
We'll do good business.
You'll be rich, Giuliano.
You must know
that l bought the land for the people.
- Why? Nobody ever did that.
- That's why.
lf you are a communist, we are out.
l only kill for a good Christian.
- l am a good Christian.
- Don't be too good.
- Or you'll end up alone.
- Me? Never.
- What do you want?
- Land.
l join you.
l join you.
Salvatore Giuliano!
Lord of the mountains!
- What the hell's going on?
- Let me through.
You will not get hurt
if you unload the money.
- Give the order.
- And if l refuse?
Stay down!
Come out!
Tell the papers that l,
Salvatore Giuliano, -
- accept the army's generosity
towards the poor of Sicily.
We will buy land for those with no
land and food for those who starve.
- For your share, not mine!
- For my third, of course.
l want all the credit.
Silvio.
- For me or the election?
- Neither.
For the peasants.
To buy land.
You are serious, aren'tyou?
They must knowthat l did this.
For them.
Why don'tyou run for
President of Sicily!
l've killed too many people.
Or maybe not enough.
l wonder if they
will love you for this.
They're very odd, our people.
We'll know soon enough ... won't we?
l am here in Rome as a Sicilian, -
- proudly following the career
of your young friend. He has style.
But as minister l am humiliated
when he ridicules my police.
As a conservative l'm terrified
when he buys land for the peasants.
He'll make Ferra popular.
We could lose the election.
My dear Trezza, l will happily
make a speech on the radio.
Sicily will listen and that will be
the end of Giuliano in politics.
lf the peasants vote
communist nextyear, -
- our party is finished.
Like the fascists, the communists
will concentrate power in the state.
So they will not allow me
to protectyour interests.
And vice versa.
The left must be destroyed
... crushed.
Your young friend must
sever his dealings with Silvio Ferra.
Let me tell you about this girl.
She has dark red hair ...
Green eyes ...
Skin pale as fresh milk.
This is about life and death,
and you sing the song of Solomon?
- Save the whores till later.
- l am talking about Giovanna Ferra.
Silvio's sister.
Giuliano gives her money
simply to impress her.
He is not a communist.
He is just in love.
- l envy him.
- Roccofino asks for reinforcements.
Let Giuliano win the election for us.
Then we will find a solution.
- Why should he help us?
- l leave certain matters to Rome.
Rome should leave others to me.
The bigger a hero Giuliano becomes, -
- the more use he will be to us
when the people vote.
You are a master in your house.
How is your son?
l've been giving you news of my son.
Couldn'tyou tell?
MlNlSTRY OF JUSTlCE
Good morning.
Thanks.
l could never control Passatempo.
But he eats out of your hand.
Now what?
- Will we see your husband tonight?
- l hope not.
He's quite happy in Paris,
spending my money.
- How is the harvest?
- The best in years.
- They tried to take my land.
- As l told Masino:
Hang them now, before the election.
Or it will be too late.
You know, Sandro, why don't we
let them have our unused land?
- A very American comment.
- l am very American.
Although l have been Sicilised.
Our unused land is worthless.
Hello.
lt's Giuliano himself.
Make a place for our guest.
Here beside me.
- l have already eaten.
- That's right.
- You dine early in the mountains.
- Yes.
But the rest of you,
go on with your lunch.
Prince Borsa ...
- This is a pleasure.
- Quite.
l've come for your jewels.
l knowthey're upstairs.
May l have your watch? Thank you.
- You have more.
- Yes, in the bank in Palermo.
You wore
the Crotone emeralds last night.
l sent them backthis morning.
No car drove from here to Palermo
in the last week.
All right.
Don't make a mess.
- You are an American, right?
- Yes.
And like every Sicilian, you want
to open a pizzeria in New Jersey.
No. Never.
l wouldn't mind being an American.
l'd like to be free.
- But no pizzeria.
- What else? The Mafia?
Your kind knows more about them
than l do. After all, you pay them.
- So you are just a bandit?
- No, not justa bandit.
Oh, right. You give money to
the people so they can buy land.
Or so you tell the papers.
l hate Glenn Miller.
Don'tyou have any Count Basie?
l love Glenn Miller.
You are so fond of jewels. You
must have heard ''String of Pearls''.
Yeah. lt's okay.
Too fast.
Slow down.
Like this.
- Your ring.
- What?
- Your emerald ring!
- No!
l want it.
- From the duke?
- My father gave it to me.
Now you give it to me.
l will always wear it.
''With this ring l thee wed ...''
What?
l suppose ...
... now you'll rape me.
Don't l attractyou?
Yes, you do.
Butyou're married ... to a duke.
l'm engaged.
Please!
lf you don't rape me,
l'll have to rape you!
They say he is
both musical and handsome.
They took my grandfather's watch!
Don Masino will string them up.
- You're really beautiful.
- That makes two of us.
- Drawthe curtains.
- l like the light.
- ln Sicily, we make love in the dark.
- lt's time you tried the light.
Women don't want to look at men.
- They do, if they are in love.
- Love?
Well, lust then.
American army shorts.
You must have seen a lot of them
when your army was here.
My husband married my money
and l married his title.
- l'm not a nun.
- You are a rapist!
- How do you paint on a ceiling?
- With great difficulty, l think.
- Do you know Truman?
- Beg your pardon?
The President ... your president.
Do you know him?
- My father is a Republican.
- A what?
Never mind.
- What about Truman?
- l make statements to the press.
Yes, we love them.
l mean it. The Sicilians love you
for whatyou say.
Some of them. Could you get
a message to Truman?
Yes, l suppose l could. What?
l can arrange a referendum in Sicily.
Sicily would vote
to join the United States.
- lf Truman agrees.
- What about Rome?
- What about ltaly?
- You kill us. Why do l steal?
l was shot because l stole bread
for Montelepre. Why?
Because many would have
starved to death. Why?
- Why?
- Because there is no work.
l'm afraid Mr. Truman won't help you.
He can't.
- Why don'tyou go to America?
- And do what?
- Work.
- ln a pizzeria ... in New Jersey?
No thanks. Here, l am Giuliano.
Not for long, l'm afraid.
Don't worry about the jewellery.
The insurance company in Milan
will pay you.
And you'll be even richer.
- Keep the ring.
- l plan to.
But l am wearing it.
''With this ring l thee wed.''
You are right.
A quarter of a million is a lot.
Yes, it its.
And it's my money, notyours.
We pay you well
so we can live safely.
Did your Excellency
ever suffer any bodily harm?
Mimmo, a coca-cola. The acid of
the champagne is bad for me.
So l drinkthe drink of your people.
l'll pour it, thank you.
- That's only fair.
- The Americans love that word.
- l drinkto fairness for all.
- Please, no wit, Don Masino.
You're acting out of character.
No irony, please.
l have so many characters.
So many uses.
Here is one, as if by magic.
Your jewels.
Brought to you by Professor Adonis
from the university of Palermo.
- ltaly's leading expert on Dante.
- Leopardi.
All's well that ends well.
You'll pay too much.
But as you won't tell the insurance
company about the jewellery, -
- your profit is a hundred percent.
- An interesting transaction.
- lnteresting?
You have met ...
and even got to know -
- the handsomest man in Sicily.
He keeps the ring.
- Why?
- l suppose ... he wears it.
lt's like grand opera.
So romantic.
The bandit,
the beautiful American duchess.
Passion.
You may be a Sicilian duchess -
- butyou're still
an American woman -
- who can match
any Sicilian man.
l'm atyour knees.
Stay as you are, Don Masino.
l will blush if you kneel.
- lf l could make you blush ...
- Aren'tyou afraid?
- Of making you blush?
- No, of Giuliano.
- That boy?
- l would be afraid.
They call him
the Lord of the Mountains.
- Sicily is mostly mountains.
- True.
The power and the money are by the
sea. Just goats in the mountains.
And Giuliano.
May l have the next dance?
To show
that we are still friends.
- l didn't know you danced.
- l danced a lot when l was young.
Like your husband.
We were boys together.
He was a duke, l was poor.
But in Sicily, all men are the same.
Yes, and the women are either
madonnas or whores.
l was just in Rome.
Howthat city wakes me up.
l always come back
with a new zest for life.
All Sicilian men have
a zest for is death.
Don't say the word.
Thank you.
The weather is changing.
Good night, gentlemen.
- Thank you, madam.
- Good night.
Well?
He still refuses to meetyou.
But he accepts your ...
paternal affection.
That's a beginning.
What he wants l give.
- Giuliano is coming to Palermo.
- No. That is out of the question.
You're crazy.
- lf anybody recognizes you ...
- How could they? l'm all dressed up.
You don't look like somebody
who would help the poor.
l bought the dress for you and the
suit for me because we are poor.
l wanted trousers with lots of pleats.
A zoot suit.
- Show-off.
- My mother always said that.
- So what did you do?
- l shot her.
- That's not funny.
- l'll never be funny again.
Not that way ... not in front of me.
- Let's go dancing.
- You are crazy.
And l am crazy because
l am here in Palermo with you.
Take me home now.
l'm Giuliano.
See? Neither horn nor tail.
Tonight l celebrate.
l'm getting married.
Hit it!
The story starts here with Giuliano
and his cousin, Aspanu.
- Which one is the cousin?
- There's a coffin with grain in it.
- But the police shoot Giuliano.
- They can't shoot him!
- Happy Easter, professor.
- Christ has risen.
May the body of Jesus Christ keep
your immortal soul and life. Amen.
May the body of Jesus Christ keep
your immortal soul and life. Amen.
- Who is he?
- Father Doldana.
- He has been here for three months.
- He has rough hands.
Salvatore Giuliano.
My sister spoke to me.
You have my blessing.
l thank you for your support.
Roccofino and his men!
He must ...
we must all do our duty.
Silvestro Canio is here. Alone!
He wants to join us.
Shall l kill him?
The oldest trickthere is.
He is a spy.
- You cost me my stripes.
- What do you have to say?
l know who
betrayed you at the church.
Father Doldana was at the barber's,
and he said you were in Montelepre.
- How did he know?
- Heard it from the confession box.
- He is not a priest.
- l know.
The barber, Frisella, told Roccofino.
Frisella has always been their spy.
He's lying. He'll betray you.
Only a friend can betray.
We'll see if you are lying.
Put it away.
- l have a customer.
- This is not the mountains, Giuliano.
Come outside.
- Say something.
- What?
You are the mayor.
Don Masino's friend.
l am. Butyou are not.
Come outside.
Salvatore ...
l cutyour father's hair for 20 years!
l've known you all your life!
Giovanna ...
Giovanna!
l gave you lemon ice
when you were a baby.
l saved your life when you were shot.
- Make your peace with God.
- ls my family going to starve?
They won't.
- For my son ... when he is grown.
- Don't do it, Giuliano.
You're not ...
You're not wise!
So die all who betray Giuliano
What are you going to do?
Until Don Masino gets me
more men, nothing.
l remember when he
bought those shoes.
- He said they would last forever.
- They did.
l've known many hard men.
But the really hard ones -
- are those who can live
with the things they did.
Why? ln public?
Everyone must know
that l am serious.
Then, serious man, -
- give these to his son.
Yourself.
lf you dare.
He wanted you to have these
when you grow up.
What l did, l had to do.
You see ... he ...
He ...
l told him l would look after you.
l will. Always
Your Excellency.
Salvatore Giuliano
respectfully asks you -
- to visit him in the mountains.
- May l take my umbrella?
- Of course.
Try not to run as we come out.
l never run. Not since school.
l have asthma.
- lt's very beautiful.
- Yes ... Scarlatti.
He was born near here.
He has asthma too.
ls it raining?
No, Excellency.
l'll get more food.
Are you ready, my son?
l hope so, father,
for l have sinned.
l have killed a man.
Worse.
He suffers from pride.
- A priest must defend himself too.
- l want to confess in the mountains.
- There we will all be ...
- Closer to God.
- Am l still not wise?
- No. l am the unwise one.
l love you, blood and all.
Heaven help us.
- We meet again, Prince Borsa.
- Again? Ah, Camilla's lunch.
- You were riveting that day.
- l hope that's a compliment.
lt is.
- Well! Camilla's ring.
- Her father gave it to her.
- Didn't he?
- No, l did, as it happens.
You too?
Since you put it like that, yes.
Me too.
lt will be fun to have you here.
l've always been curious aboutyou.
We are almost the same age ...
- He's 45 if he's a day.
- That's not so old.
You'll like it up here.
lt's good for asthma.
l may be tactless,
but what do you think l'm worth?
- You know, on the market.
- The reward for me is 10 million.
l don't want to insult
the richest man in Sicily, -
- so l would have to ask at least ...
... ten times the price.
- l hope my family agrees.
- They'd better.
The news comes just like our police.
Afterthe crime.
Here we are, all together.
Friends.
We have a common enemy.
You all rule your own city.
But l'm a prisoner in mine.
Giuliano lets me live because
he is not ready to fightyou.
But when he is ... what will you do?
- l'm here to listen.
- We respectyou, Don Masino.
Withoutyou and your friends in the
American army, we wouldn't be here.
That was yesterday. Today we
are being challenged and ridiculed.
lf we forgive the kidnapping of
Prince Borsa, we'll lose all respect.
Agreed.
Let me make a final attempt
to reason with Giuliano.
No.
Thank you.
l knew you would agree with me.
There lies our strength.
We act as one.
You make no sense, Borsa.
Your servants are like family, -
- but if they want some of your
useless land, you kill them.
Even the useless land has belonged
to my family for a thousand years.
l hold it for my son,
as my father did for me -
- and his father for him.
We will never let it go.
- We can't.
- And if the communists win?
They won't.
Sicilians believe in God.
- The fake priest is dead.
- Good.
l crucified him. Alive.
- He is an cruel man.
- And you are not?
l do what l have to do.
- People say you're a communist.
- l hate politics.
- l also believe in God.
- You are marrying Ferra's sister.
He is after my land.
For the peasants.
l'll help him. lf l can.
- Why mustpeople love you?
- Why mustpeople hate you?
Me? They don't. l'm the prince.
l am like the south wind from
Africa. l've always been here.
- You haven't.
- Without a ransom, you are done for.
Then my son will be the prince.
The south wind goes on.
- l hate you for whatyou did.
- You don't hate me.
You hate not being me.
But if you were, you wouldn't be you.
You can take my money and my life,
butyou can never be me.
- That's metaphysics, Aspanu.
- lt's horseshit, Giuliano.
That's life, gentlemen.
He refuses to come to me.
But l must come to him.
Like a king. He has promised
three times his own reward for me.
He forbids the police
to patrol after midnight.
- So his people can visit the family!
- ln Sicily, the family is everything.
- Well?
- lt looks good.
What will be next?
- What kind of a man is he?
- l've never met him.
Never? Butyou said
that he was your son.
l meant the son l never had,
but that l mean to have.
l have spies in his camp.
lf l asked them to kill him,
you know what they'd do?
Kill me. They love him.
- All Sicily loves him.
- ln the last election ...
Silvio Ferra nearly won.
This year, he will.
l'll see to it that we win.
On one condition.
Giuliano must be pardoned.
Anything is possible in ltaly.
But the sun does not rise in the west.
- He has committed several ...
- Promise him a pardon.
- Will that work?
- He is to be married. Settling down.
- Will he emigrate?
- Promise him a pardon.
THE BANDlT KlNG
SALVATORE GlULlANO
- l hope we won't meet again.
- But we had a good time.
l did. No asthma.
Giuliano, stay out of politics.
For your own good.
- Nothing changes here.
- Not if you always say that.
- l shall keep on saying it.
- You will, l won't.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, gentlemen.
He doesn't want a shave.
He's shaving himself.
He hasn't done that for 20 years.
- You look like a bridegroom.
- You must perform the service.
Something in your eye?
Dust.
Sicilian dust.
- You look fit, Hector.
- You look like the president himself.
l kiss your hand.
- You kept me waiting.
- l am flattered.
Well, here we are, at last.
l've just been to Rome.
There may be a way out.
- Out of what?
- lnto what?
The government fears thatyou support
the communists. Butyou are Sicilian.
- You are the Sicilian.
- Maybe the Russians will pardon us.
Let's be practical. Trezza's party
is the least dangerous to us.
- Their victory will benefit us all.
- What is our common good?
For us, communism is not
commonly a good thing.
- Don'tyou agree?
- What if l help Trezza?
- What do l get?
- A kick in the ass.
As a sign of good faith,
the minister has sentyou this.
Colonel Amato's
military plan to destroy you.
My wedding gift for you
and the beautiful Giovanna.
The minister has personally promised
me thatyou will be pardoned.
After the election, of course ...
which we will win.
l'm sure he would never lie to you.
Nor to me.
Even so, l want to hear it
from Trezza himself.
- Trezza will promise you in Rome.
- l can't go to Rome!
Butyou can go to Palermo!
As you have proved.
You can go to the cathedral.
- The cardinal will promise you.
- lf you can't trust him ...
l trust no one!
ExceptAspanu Pisciotta.
Let him talkto the cardinal.
- l knew we would be friends.
- l knew we would be friends.
l hear you, Don Masino.
l understand you.
l kiss your hand, my son.
Goodbye.
Come in, my son.
Hello, Aspanu.
- ls this life?
- Whatever it is ...
lt's better than death.
We have a message from Rome
for Salvatore Giuliano. A solution.
- For both of you.
- Rome is nervous.
Because Giuliano is so popular
among parts of the population.
People only listen to him
because l hold this to their throats.
- Not in front os His Eminence.
- That's a bit crude, Aspanu.
- l was like you once.
- You were never like me.
We are honest ... in our way.
''Should Salvatore Giuliano,
citizen of Montelepre in Sicily ...''
l knowthat cough ...
l'd know it if l were dead.
You will be soon!
You just made a deal with the
government, the Mafia and the church.
- To do what?
- Keep the communists from voting.
- Scare the peasants.
- And?
- You and me are pardoned.
- What then?
l join Don Masino and you go
to America with Giovanna.
The Lord of the Mountains
and his lady. May l have a dance?
Thank you. You look beautiful.
l mean it.
Follow me.
l am no singer, l am a dancer!
That's how we do in Palermo.
- Giovanna says you are leaving.
- That's what she wants.
- How aboutyou?
- l hoped to do something ...
- Help the people.
- lf we win, everybody will have land.
l thought nothing changes in Sicily.
- Don't work with the communists.
- We agree on the land reform.
Stay away from them.
Let that be our wedding gift.
Giuliano ... a hundred years!
We fire over their heads.
Remember!
- My family is down there.
- And mine.
Firecrackers.
No!
Halt! Stop!
Take him away.
Go for the living ones.
You!
- l told you not to come.
- l know.
Come on.
l said, ''Fire over their heads.''
- To scare them.
- And whose idea was that?
Don Masino's.
He tricked you.
Don Masino did not fire
that machine gun.
And when l find out who it was ...
What difference does it make?
They'll never forgive you.
l'll finish your work ...
lf l can.
You will end up like him.
l know. Sad, isn't it?
Make your peace with God.
Both of you, on your knees.
l go to Hell standing up.
l swear we did not shoot at people!
- lf he hadn't, you'd be dead.
- Do whatyou have to do.
So die all
who betray Giuliano
Sanctuary? Where?
All ltaly hates Giuliano like
the plague ... thanks to us.
An American is coming
to help him to emigrate.
Too late. l am sending
commandoes and paratroopers -
- and tanks after them.
We will level the mountains.
And Giuliano with them.
Giovanna sails to Tunis
where she gets her papers.
From there to the USA. There, your
father's old employer takes her in.
You'll join her later.
Don Masino has done his best.
- He protects his interests.
- He protected you for three years!
But now ...
Their party won because of me.
Because of the bloodbath in Ginestra.
- Now l want that land.
- They will never give it up.
- l will make them.
- How?
Get out!
Well, Aspanu,
isn't it time to think of yourself?
- He's right. Go away!
- No!
l stay till the end.
What else?
Giuliano!
Your Eminence ...
You're now my prisoner.
- Guns in God's house?
- A traitor in God's house?
You broke your word.
l shall not move from this place.
Kill me here!
lf you don't come with me, -
- l'll tie you up like a goat
and carry you off to the mountains.
- You're crazy!
- Wave at them.
Your immortal soul is in peril.
And yours? Hell has
a special district for false priests.
You'll have a lot of company.
Many friends.
- What do you want?
- l wanted an honest man of God!
Now you must tell the people -
- that the church will bless them
if they claim the uncultivated land.
l am not the church.
- Nor honest, according to you.
- Butyou can still redeem yourself.
There is only one Redeemer
and you are not He.
Now shootyour gun!
That's all you are good for.
You lied to me.
- Don'tyou dare ...
- Salvatore!
You have gone too far, my son.
You have no sense of reality.
l have often discussed you
with Don Masino.
Since the shooting because of
the bread he has protected you.
From the Friends, from the police.
Exceptyourself.
He would adoptyou like a son.
l said it was impossible.
You are only God's son!
God's purposes are not of this earth!
Don Masino will save your wife
and your unborn child.
With my blessing.
He will try to save you.
l have advised against it.
Now you know everything.
My son, you are at the end.
So kill me.
The last column in the glorious story
of Giuliano the bandit.
Whatever l've been,
l was not justa bandit.
l was ... stop the car.
Out!
We only had one Saviour,
Giuliano. We crucified Him ...
... 2000 years ago.
Behind those gates -
- are 100,000 of acres
of unused land.
lt's lying there waiting there.
For you!
lt's yours! By law.
The laws of Rome
are nothing to do with us.
Will you let five of Don Masino's men
starve your children?
- Did you forget why you are here?
- To pay your brother our respects.
Your fear does not honour him!
Pull them off theirorses
and bring them to me.
Dismount.
Kneel and make peace with God.
l execute you
in the name of God and Sicily!
They still won't forgive me,
will they?
No, but they'll never forgetyou.
Colonel Amato is here.
You succeeded in doing
what no one else ever did.
You have made all the parties
of ltaly strive for the same goal:
You, dead.
The army consists of bachelors.
So there won't be any widows.
Giovanna must leave Sicily now.
What?
- There's something in my eye.
- Come here.
Call me when you get to America.
- Where?
- You will be told.
Then l will settle my score
with Don Masino.
- And then l will join you.
- One man can't handle Masino.
- One man?
- Two! We're all that's left.
You're alone, Salvatore.
That's how l started.
l did all right.
Leave with me, now.
No, that's too dangerous for you.
l'll come later.
- Life is hard, Enzo.
- Who said it wasn't?
l can't do anymore.
l know you're right.
l told him he was crazy.
lf l could just ...
You don't want the credit.
Neither do l.
The police or the army will have it.
- But after l ...
- You will give yourself up.
You are his accomplice.
A year or two in prison.
Then a pardon.
- lf ...
- Life is hard, Aspanu!
- The American's boat is waiting.
- She must call, then we go.
You're doing the right thing.
Runing away?
Tell Don Masino that l leave only
because everybody else is gone.
ExceptAspanu.
ExceptAspanu.
Yes.
l'm here.
- With me gone, you'll be safe.
- l don't want to be safe.
- Do you want to go to America?
- No.
- What do you want?
- Land.
- What will you do now?
- Fight to the end like you.
- Why?
- So you come backto us.
l'll tell you a secret.
l will never go away.
Not really.
l will always be here, somehow.
With you.
Goodbye, Giuliano!
Goodbye.
Stop the car!
Get out, Hector.
Salvatore,
l did all l could for you.
l swear it!
But l could not help you.
No one could.
You promised the people land.
They just wanted bread!
Don Masino knewthat.
Butyou didn't.
What did Don Masino promise you?
Aspanu Pisciotta.
Are you ready?
Shoot.
l can't.
l told you l wasn't afraid to die.
Well, l'm not.
My time here is over.
Pull the trigger.
- l can't. l love you.
- Obey me!
Howard Austin from Palermo.
The famous Sicilian outlaw
Salvatore Giuliano has been shot -
- by an ltalian special unit.
Did you bring it?
Opium?
Dreams ...
So die all who betray Giuliano
Dream of gold, my boy.
lN LOVlNG MEMORY
Why didn't he ...
Why wouldn't he come to me?
Why should he?
He was his own father.
He invented himself,
then we killed him.
You and l.
Now he is gone.
What next?
What next?
There is nothing next.
There never is ...
... here.
