What are you staring at?
Who, me?
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.
You were staring at something.
I was looking at your ear.
What's wrong with it?
You're an ear doctor?
-No.
-Well then, leave me alone.
I think you look like
an accountant.
I am.
You following me?
Yes.
Why?
Need company.
What for?
A talk.
People don't talk anymore.
I don't want to talk.
Besides, I don't like you.
Pity, I improve on
acquaintance.
Hard to believe.
You look as if you had
funny ideas.
What sort?
Bugger off!
Don't you have funny ideas?
What ideas?
Well, don't you ever think
of killing anyone?
What?
I said didn't you ever
want to kill someone?
-Who?
-Anyone!
-Why?
-No reason, on impulse!
-No.
-Never?
No.
Not even in the subway?
Not really...
But, it's easy.
Yeah!
A knife in your pocket!
The knife leaves the pocket!
The blade springs up!
There! The belly is pierced!
A quidam falls.
No one stops.
He looks like a bum asleep.
What's a quidam ?
Anyone.
A guy of no importance,
whose death upsets no one.
You never think of
such things?
No.
Well, what do you think of?
Your knife.
-You like it?
-No.
Put it in your pocket.
Those things are dangerous
to play with.
You're right.
Here, it's a gift. Take it.
I don't want it.
Take it, it's a good knife,
do me a favor!
-I don't need a knife.
-Me neither.
If I keep it,
I'll do something stupid.
I don't give a damn about
your knife! There...
I never saw it!
Don't leave that thing there.
Someone might get
a funny idea.
Are you overworking?
Hardly, I'm out of work.
You're lucky.
Don't you believe it.
It's exhausting doing nothing.
You think work is restful?
Depends what work...
Mine bores me,
wears me out.
I flake out in front
of the TV.
I daren't even go to sleep
because of my nightmares!
Dreadful nightmares!
What sort?
I dream the police are after me!
-For murder?
-Of course.
They catch you?
-Who?
-The police.
No, that's just it!
They are behind me, but
they don't get me.
They follow me! All right!
I wake up in a cold sweat,
exhausted!
It's no excuse for carrying
a knife.
I always carried a knife!
-What for?
-To cut my meat.
-You taken it?
-What?
-Your knife!
-No.
It's gone!
I told you not
to leave it there.
It tempted someone,
these days...
I forbid you to get
in the car!
Why? We're becoming friends!
Murderer!
But I told you,
it's a nightmare!
You can't leave me!
What are you doing there?
Well, there's a knife
in my stomach...
Oh, damn!
But it's mine!
Well, of course, when things
are in the wind.
Who's the bastard?
A young man, wearing a coat...
-My type?
-Yes.
If I was you,
I'd get lost...
But it's not me,
it can't be me!
I just got there,
I wasn't there!
-Didn't say it was you.
-Then who?
I don't know,
I didn't pay attention.
You should in such cases.
Will you leave me alone!
I'm dying! Go away!
-I can't leave you...
-Oh yes, I've seen worse.
But now you may not see
much more.
Oh, it'll soon be over.
-Does it hurt?
-Strangely, no.
I don't feel quite myself...
What does it feel like?
Like a sink emptying out.
Won't you take my cash?
You can't have much...
No, but it's not worth
taking it...
Have a drink on me...
Well, all right...
have a good trip...
Thank you, I'll do my best.
Don't you want your knife?
What d'you think?
Your fingerprints are
on the handle.
It's too easy for the police.
Besides, you may
need it again.
It's efficient...
Not closing the door today?
I just saw a murder
in the subway.
Wipe the oilcloth!
It was an accountant,
knifed in the belly.
Take this!
What bothers me is...
I wonder whether
I killed him.
Stop the bullshit, please!
Here, look at this...
The blood is still wet.
You'd do better finding a job,
it's more sensible.
You're eating with your
coat on?
I'm cold.
It's not very intimate,
you're like a visitor.
We're all visitors.
We arrive, some sightseeing
and off we go.
D'you think it's worth
taking off my coat? Why?
To catch my death of cold?
I don't get you.
Well, I do, that's the
main thing.
And how was your day?
Like any Monday.
You want some fish cakes?
Yes.
Oh, listen! I forgot
to tell you the news!
-What?
-Guess.
Come on, tell me!
We're not alone in the
high-rise...
there's a new tenant.
No kidding!
What floor?
I don't know, upstairs.
I'm the tenant from the 5th.
I just wanted to welcome you.
You're my first neighbor.
I'm glad you're here.
We'll feel less alone.
You married?
Widower.
My sympathy.
I'm out of work. And you?
Police inspector.
-Good thing...
-What?
That you're a
police inspector.
Why?
Because I saw a murder,
in the subway...
Really?
The poor guy got a knife
in the belly.
Is that so?
Yeah...
What bugs me,
it was my knife...
So?
Put yourself in my place!
I'm asking myself...
Asking what?
I'm asking myself
if I killed him...
You don't look like a killer.
I could show you the knife...
It's at home,
in the dish washer...
Listen, my friend.
Crimes, murders...
I get my fill all day.
Now I'm off duty. I'm eating.
I just moved in, I'm tired
and you're bugging me!
So, go home quietly
and forget about me.
Why not come to bed?
I'm smoking.
It's late.
You going to chain-smoke
all night?
Why not?
Aren't you tired?
You're damned right,
I'm tired!
Well, then?
If you know you'll have
nightmares,
you don't go to bed!
I might as well smoke.
Want one?
Doing nothing puts you
on edge.
You need a good tiring job.
You'd calm down.
Why did you stop looking?
Why look, because when I do
look, I don't find anything?
Listen...
if you come to bed,
I promise...
I'll take off my nightgown!
I don't feel in the mood...
Neither do l, you know that.
But sometimes, we could
make an effort!
What's on your mind?
I'm scared.
What of?
-You know who the tenant is?
-No.
-He's a cop!
-So what?
You don't get it?
I dream of cops.
When I'm awake,
who do I meet? A cop!
In my house!
Doesn't seem odd to you?
You've done nothing!
That's just it...
That's what I ask myself.
I didn't marry a murderer!
May be better to marry
a murderer than no one.
You notice how many people in
the subway look murder-prone?
-No.
-It's incredible how many...
What about me?
Do I look murder-prone?
You should be careful...
-Think so?
-Yes.
You scare the shit out of me!
There's no need to be afraid!
Anyhow, we all go
the same way.
It's the only thing
we're sure about.
The problem is to know
how soon...
You again!
I'm worried,
my wife's not home.
She leaves her office at 6 pm,
it's 9.30.
I set the table, cooked
the potatoes...
and she's not home.
I'm afraid something
happened.
More than likely. Come on!
Morvandiaux speaking.
That you Gardanne?
Tell me, what's on the books
for attacks tonight?
Only women, of course!
I'll wait...
Just a moment. Short-haired,
brunette, 5 ft 8...
mole on left breast,
appendectomy,...
platinum wedding ring.
Familiar?
Boss!
-The husband?
-Afraid so...
-Not squeamish?
-Come on!
This way...
Careful of the broken bottles.
That her?
Yes, that's her.
My sympathy.
Not been raped?
No, as usual.
Have you noticed her
expression, boss?
As if she felt deep relief...
Who knows what she
felt like...
Are you Alphonse Tram?
Possibly...
I'd like to talk to you
for a few minutes.
What about?
Your wife.
You knew her?
I killed her.
Come in.
Have you eaten?
No.
I've some soup leftover...
want some?
Well, I wouldn't say no.
Doesn't taste good?
Yes...
Then why are you making
a face like that?
It won't go down.
Upset stomach?
-I think about her...
-Who?
-Your wife.
-Do as I do...
Forget about her!
I can't forget her!
If I let myself go,
we'd be in a fine mess!
Now, pull yourself together!
If not, I'll throw you out!
Can I see her room?
Are you sure it's wise?
Please!
Oh, I don't mind,
but I warn you...
it'll upset you.
Don't look at the mess!
No personal things?
Very few.
Here... her mascara.
In the bathroom you may find
some interesting items...
So sad... very unhappy...
There wasn't time to do
much for her!
Her clothes?
Almost nothing...
Wedding?
Yes, ours.
Two New Year's Eve parties.
Another marriage,
an office friend...
She perspired?
You know when
brunettes dance...
She liked dancing?
Like all women. Poor thing...
Quite a good photo of her.
Oh, thank you so much!
You can see the sadness
in her eyes.
You let her out alone
in a deserted suburb!
I told her to be careful...
Who is it?
Don't move!
Disturbing you?
On the contrary.
I brought a bottle...
-Come on, it's a friend!
-Sure?
Yes! He's a police inspector.
Really, well, that's a relief.
My wife's murderer.
A pleasure.
Had a good day?
Routine.
A lot of murders, just now?
Not bad.
You find the killers?
As few as possible.
A killer is less dangerous
out, than in prison.
Why?
In prison, he contaminates
the innocent...
I really don't know
who that is!
A mistake, it's crazy...
how many people get lost
in these high-rises!
Maybe it's a woman...
Am I disturbing you?
Your name?
It will mean nothing.
But I have something to say
that will mean something.
To me?
Yes, to you.
Come in.
-Gentlemen...
-Wine?
Gladly.
I was in the subway,
the other evening...
when you knifed that poor
defenseless man in the stomach.
Really?
Nice work, discreet, fast...
Congratulations!
"Here's a man who knows
his job" I said.
"I'll follow him a while,
find out where he lives..."
I didn't kill him.
Really?
Someone stole my knife.
Then why is it here,
on the table?
It is the same knife,
isn't it?
Put it down!
I'm a police inspector, at
the first blackmail attempt...
-I'll arrest you!
-No question of blackmail.
Keep it short! Our friend
lost his wife, he's tired!
My sympathy.
Go on!
It's a small service
you could do for me...
What sort of service?
Use your knife again.
With the same discretion
and speed.
-You scare me!
-I'm sorry...
Forgive our mistrust,
but nowadays...
Quite right to be cautious.
Is the victim a man or woman?
-A man.
-Then it's not for me.
It's not you he came for!
It's me!
I can show an interest!
Gentlemen, please!
...couldn't even make her
happy...
I advise you to leave
my wife alone!
I'll do as I like with her!
Oh, shut up! Damn it!
Forgive them...
they're both on edge.
Please, go on!
Here is the key
to the garage...
where the victim goes
every night at 7.30 sharp...
driving a green Volvo,
license number 292 BX 74.
33 bis, rue Amedee Cousin...
You know the street?
-We'll find it.
-Bravo.
You'll get me out
of a nightmare.
A bastard ruining my life,
mine and my wife's!
We'll put an end to that.
Should I offer you money?
No thank you.
I prefer a clean job.
Allow me to shake your hand.
The first time I'll see
a man die.
Me too, usually I get there
too late.
He's late.
Traffic's bad.
Is that a Volvo?
Looks like one.
What is this mess?
Don't forget you have
a contract.
A suckers' contract!
Can't kill a man
I drank with!
Too late!
The wheel's turning!
I'm waiting for your knife.
Shut up! You'll die later!
-Help!
-Jerk!
Shut up or I'll shoot!
Yes, please, please...
I won't forget this.
The jerk's dead!
He won't get away with it!
Leonard Augene, 33 bis rue
Amedee Cousin. That's here!
Follow me!
Leonard, 4th!
Good evening... police!
Your husband's been killed!
Downstairs, in the garage!
I was expecting you.
I'm ready.
Just a moment, I'll turn off
the gas and come with you.
Where to?
Oh, you tell me that.
He said: "They will knife me
down here, then come up.
"Don't keep them waiting,
be ready". So here I am.
-What are we to do with you?
-That's your problem.
You killed my husband,
take care of me!
I'll wear mourning,
but that's all!
Calling all cars!
Calling all cars!
Morvandiaux here!
Kramer localized... heading
direction Theodore Botherel.
Coming from Auguste Blanqui.
Top priority!
Affirmative!
-What's going on?
-An emergency!
Hands up, Kramer!
I'm here!
Not another step, Kramer!
It's me, it's Morvandiaux!
Damn! It's not Kramer!
Inspector Cavanna...
Damn it! A slip-up...
Good night.
-Going already?
-Yes, I am.
Just one for the road?
No, I've had enough!
Just one more...
It's getting late...
Wait for me! Wait for me!
-What's the matter?
-Can I sleep with you?
-With me? Why?
-I'm scared.
It's not the Ritz.
I warn you, I'm tired.
Having a rough time,
my life's upside down.
I need rest.
No one will stop you sleeping.
Just show me where I put
my things.
Sleeping with your coat on?
Yes... no... well... no!
I hope you don't snore.
No, I don't think so.
Good night.
If you hear me scream,
don't worry.
Sometimes I have nightmares.
Really? Me too!
Is that so?
Are you afraid?
Yes...
Take me!
Yes... I'll take you.
Make me your mistress!
Yes, right away.
I'm so terribly excited!
Me too... it's beginning...
If you hear me shout
in your arms...
don't worry, sometimes
I go far, far away.
Express yourself freely,
the building is almost empty.
God, what's happening to us
is going to be so beautiful.
I wonder if we
shouldn't wait a bit.
No! Now! Do it!
Now!
Now!
-Expecting someone?
-No one!
-Your wife?
-No, she's dead.
-Who is it then?
-I don't know!
We didn't hear anything.
Continue!
You were kissing me...
Yes, that's right!
No, not like that!
We're not machines!
Forgive me, I'm not
concentrating.
Knowing someone's at the door,
upsets me.
Oh, all right! Open it!
Damn! I'm coming!
I've brought
your friend back!
Keep him, do what you like
with him!
Listening to him walking
round in circles!
I've had my fill!
I'd like an hour sleep!
But, I am busy... in there...
Work it out!
I go to work at 7!
How long do you intend
bugging us?
-Just go home!
-Home!
-Who's going to take me?
-You must be taken?
You wouldn't leave me alone
in the streets at 3 am?
-With all that's going on!
-Afraid of your shadow?
That's it!
Afraid of my shadow!
If it was only me,
there'd never be any problem.
But something dark always
follows me...
looking for trouble.
Avoid street lights,
and there'll be no shadow!
Fine! Thanks for the advice.
I won't bother you anymore!
Bye!
If you read about me tomorrow,
don't be surprised!
I wash my hands of it.
It's your responsibility.
I'll walk home alone...
Wait a second please!
-What is it?
-I said "wait"!
Don't move, I'll see
what I can do.
It's all right,
I'll walk you home!
No, it'll be all right!
This is really good of you.
More guys like you,
there'd be fewer accidents.
Speed up a bit!
You afraid?
No, not at all!
There's a new woman in
my life, and she's waiting.
Did you lock the door?
No.
You should have...
-Your place far?
-500 yards.
First left, second right
and we're there!
Keep moving!
-Not so loud!
-Why?
Women are asleep in all
these houses...
Stop the bullshit,
there are no houses! Move it!
Is that it?
-Well, bye!
-Wait!
Why? Is this your place
or not?
Yes, there's still the yard...
Damn! Worse than a dame!
Want to be tucked in too?
Don't be mean!
Hurry up! I count to ten,
then I'm off!
Watch me, eh?
Keep looking at me?
Shut up or I'll kick you
in the pants!
I'll cuddle you, you'll see!
I'll cuddle you... all over!
Excuse me, sir!
I thought you were a woman...
Do I look like a woman?
No, it's not exactly that,
you know...
in the dark,
under the sheets...
...a body... curves...
Before you put your hand
somewhere, look twice!
Because it might be
a tough customer!
Or it might be a trap!
And it might go off
in your face!
Cool it, you guys!
The gentleman apologizes,
a misunderstanding.
We all go to bed
and forget about it!
Come on!
I'll talk to you later!
How about a drink?
No thanks, very kind...
Know of a lovely woman
in the area?
A lonesome woman?
Let's see...
There's the one next door...
If you like mature women.
What do you mean "mature"?
Well, the kind who
makes jam...
Is she really alone?
Absolutely. Divorced.
Got a dog?
No. She had one...
but she had to get rid of it.
-Why?
-It bit her.
-She had to put it to sleep?
-Yes.
It must have been
tough for her.
Alphonse...
What is it?
Listen to me...
You were very good to me...
so this woman is for you,
my gift!
I don't want her!
Do me a favor! Take her!
I'll never dare
visit you again.
And what will you do?
I'll take a walk.
With your shadow?
I'll keep my hands
in my pockets.
Another step, I'll send you
to the hospital!
He came in the room,
carrying a knife.
Come quickly!
My husband has them covered!
I thought you were divorced.
We were! Bad luck,
we're reunited.
Now, we're never apart!
Where is she?
-What is it?
-The widow's gone!
-Why should I care?
-Did you see her?
No! I'm trying to sleep.
Look after your own women!
Call the station!
Something may have happened!
I'm not spending every night
in empty lots.
There, there, here I am...
Hold me tight, tighter!
Yes, I'm here,
don't be afraid.
Did you sleep well, darling?
Not bad...
Nightmares?
As usual. How about you?
A little restless...
Cream in your coffee?
No! Black!
What time is it?
7 o'clock.
Can you hear the traffic?
Do you love me?
Yes...
Did I disappoint you?
I didn't shout too much?
Oh, no...
Well, you gave me a
lovely trip!
Where?
In your arms, my love.
Oh, I see!
I nearly died ten times...
Some jam?
Yes.
Orange?
Red!
-Genevieve is sick!
-What is it?
I don't know! A fever!
Something fishy?
Charles!
Vincent!
Marcel!
A high temperature.
Did you give her any poison?
What are you doing here?
Premonition.
-A doctor in the area?
-No.
Only one answer:
medical SOS!
Who's sick?
This way.
Yes, I'm here...
Is the heart beating?
Apparently.
Is it serious?
Please, leave me with
the patient.
She'll recover, you'll see...
Of course, she's a strong
woman.
Thank God, I have you two!
You bitch! I'll show you,
you whore!
I'll give it to you!
Slight viral infection,
nothing serious.
Give her cold baths with
mustard powder.
Keep her warm for a few days.
She must drink a lot, watch
the urine.
You owe me 150 francs.
Thank you.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
It's locked?
Yes, it's locked.
Would you mind opening it?
Very much.
Why?
How about a drink?
Of what?
Red wine.
Not thirsty?
Listen, you guys, here's
the cash! An accident...
I swear it's the first time...
It was too much for me.
Can't resist widows.
How do you know
I am a widow?
You won't kill a doctor?
You never killed anyone?
Yes of course, a few
mistaken diagnoses.
Now you're the patient,
I'm looking after you.
Agreed?
But I'm not sick!
Just a little chill...
Darn! No, don't be stupid!
We must stop this slaughter.
Could be worse.
If the building was full...
believe me, there'd be
more murders.
We'll dump him in an
empty lot?
One should have advantage
of suburbia.
The kids will find him
tomorrow.
Get in the back, shorty!
Calling all cars!
Morvandiaux here!
Heart attack.

Top priority!
-Affirmative!
-What is it?
-Emergency!
-Darn it! Why us?
-Do we go?
-We're busy!
-And if a guy dies?
-We're not doctors.
-We go then call an ambulance.
-Why can't he call it himself?
-Maybe he hasn't the strength.
-He called SOS though.
-He thought it wasn't serious.
-In this case, he can wait.
Suppose it got worse?
Hearts go quickly!
Starts in the left arm...
then you're out.
Can we let a man die?
Do as you like, without me.
-Medicine isn't my line.
-Giving up?
I'm near home, I'm going
to bed.
Get moving!
The guy may be dying!
I'll stretch my legs!
Don't fall into a trap!
Darn it! Music!
So what?
I hate it!
Especially strings!
Let's get out!
I smell trouble!
Doctor?
Yes...
Would you care to come
upstairs?
Brahms.
Do you like him?
Not at all.
Where's the patient?
This way...
But who's sick?
You are.
Me?
I'm afraid so.
I'm perfectly well!
You surprise me.
You're so pale.
No, I'm not.
But I assure you.
Besides, you are perspiring.
Lie down.
Don't stand up in such a
state!
-Alphonse!
-Now lie down...
as you feel unwell.
Be sensible...
Alphonse! Stay with me!
I'm here.
Pain in the left arm?
Absolutely none!
-A weak heart?
-I don't think so...
but he's been in poor shape.
Get me out of here!!
Breathe deeply... relax...
D'you have a tranquilizer?
Don't worry, I've prepared
everything.
No!
I knew you liked
chamber music.
Close your eyes
and listen...
Not that music! Alphonse!
A glass of champagne,
my friend?
In a few moments,
it'll be over.
A word of advice, young man.
Choose your acquaintances
better.
I hardly know him!
He's a neighbor!
He's done great harm.
I thought so...
Don't worry, soon he'll do
no more harm.
Alphonse! Alphonse!
Morvandiaux's not dead!
He's a tough nut to crack!
The ghosts had better behave!
You've gone crazy!
I'm not finished yet!
Come on!
Oh, the bastards!
What about you...
What do you mean?
Your apartment will soon
be vacant.
Why?
Because you're a bastard too!
You dropped me like
a hot potato!
You're off my visiting list!
-You wouldn't do that?
-Why not?
I just finished off
5 musicians.
No sweat for a down-and-cut!
Nothing like a good knife!
You wouldn't do that?
Why not? Between friends?
This way gentlemen! Hands
against the wall, legs apart!
I'm Chief Insp. Morvandiaux!
There's been a murder!
No slip-ups!

bothered you, boss.

Every time I find a woman,
you bump her off, eh?
Whose fault?
Alone in an empty building!
Think about me!
Known as the
"dynamic of murder".
Maybe he's got that famous
extra chromosome?
Not at all!
The concrete is driving us
crazy! The empty lots!
The inhuman world around us!
The monstrous,
soulless city!
I want to see trees.
I want to hear birds.
That's why I kill
lonely women!
Because as they die...
it's like hearing a bird,
making a little sound...
It's like walking in a wood.
It gives me air... oxygen...
Shut up!
The elevator!
It's working.
-Must be someone inside.
-Who?
I don't know!
Where's he going?
No one coming down!
Then it's empty.
The elevator that
rides alone?
-Someone called it...
-Who?
How do I know?
We're alone in this
damned building.
-Maybe not...
-How about a nap?
You crazy?
We must find out.
Smells of tobacco.
First it smells of tobacco, then
it smells of trouble.
I don't like it...
Search this building,
bring in anyone you find!
-Got the tear gas?
-Yes, boss!
Get moving! I'm with
my friends in the lobby...
to stop any escape.
Marteno!
Give me some ammo,
my gun is empty!
How many, boss?
A handful.
Boss!
Yes!
A strangled woman on the 5th!
Forget it! She's with us!
Boss!
Yes!
Found a suspect.
Get him here at the double.
What are you doing?
Bugging the place?
-I live here.
-Oh, since when?
-I just moved in.
-You'll move out!
-Why?
-Because I say so!
I have a lease, I gave
a deposit.
Paid 3 months in advance!
This place is unhealthy!
Murders have been committed.
I don't want another
criminal neighbor!
I never killed anyone,
I'm an artist!
A musician! 3rd violin
at the Opera!
-What?
-I'm an ordinary musician.
A very insignificant
violinist!
Handcuffs!
Why?
What have I done?
No violinists in
this building.
Musicians
are forbidden here!
No scales,
no arpeggios here!
No violins driving us mad
as they scale up 30 floors!
Violins get on my nerves!
I'm allergic!
Know Jacqueline Pradel?
The Desmarets Trio, was
a real artist!
Very great! She was my wife!
She spent her life
doing scales.
I was a young inspector,
all the lousy jobs...
the beating-ups,
interrogations all day long.
I came home exhausted, to be
greeted with scales!
Not five minutes rest!
One day I plugged her violin
into the socket. Get me?
I loved her, was crazy
about her.
She didn't die in her bath?
Of course not!
I ran the bath later!
Work over this guy, until
he starts to talk!
Right, boss!
Get moving!
Excuse me, boss...
The boys and l, well,
for sometime...
we've been worried about you.
We think you're taciturn,
unenthusiastic...
and we're bothered.
We wonder if you're not
heading for a breakdown.
With your retirement in 2
years, it'll be a shame.
You should get away...
the country...
Forget about everything.
You must slow down sometimes,
boss.
If not, you'll crack up...
I'm cold.
Me too.
Breathe deeply, make the
most of the air.
It's not raining.
My feet are numb.
Mine too.
Wearing your thick
wool socks?
Two pairs!
Let's walk,
it'll warm us up.
No thanks,
I don't trust woods.
I prefer advancing in
open country.
This forest bugs me.
We said if the weather
cleared, we'd go gathering...
Gathering what?
Mushrooms.
The guy who gets me to eat
them hasn't been born!
Anyhow, it's going to rain.
A glass of wine?
Ruins your stomach,
that rotgut!
You're real pains, you guys!
We're not pains!
It's nature, that's the pain.
I'm bored! I'm fed up with
this greenery!
It's all green!
If the chimney drew properly,
we'd light a fire.
To get smoked out like
last night?
-It was windy.
-My ass, windy!
It's a lousy chimney,
that's all!
Theoretically, a fire is
meant to warm, eh?
Of course.
Well, how can we warm
ourselves...
if we leave the windows open
to let out the smoke?
It's the wood.
Why the wood?
It's damp.
Everything's damp!
Never saw such a damp place.
The sheets are damp at night,
in the morning I can't move.
I'm one big ache, some cure!
I'm mildewy!
We'll come in the summer.
Without me.
Now it's brass monkey time!
The most charming
companions...
You happy in this hole?
Why not? I can breathe.
The air is pure...
it's quiet, I'm relaxing.
You think it's quiet?
-Yes...
-Damn!
All those damn birds!
He thinks it's quiet!
You prefer cars?
Maybe.
Those birds are getting
on my nerves.
Listen, you're getting on
mine, I'm taking a walk.
No, stay here!
Don't be a fool!
-Why?
-Mustn't separate.
-Why not, damn it?
-I don't know, premonition.
What kind?
Bad, we must stick
together...
Senior citizens!
Breathe in.
Alphonse!
What?
Notice anything?
Where?
Listen.
What is it?
The birds stopped singing.
You should be glad.
Dumbbell!
It means someone is coming!
Cut the bullshit!
It's not bullshit,
not a bird!
You'll scare me with
your garbage!
Goddamned damp!
I'd say "sabotage"!
Wait for me!
My door's stuck!
Wait for me!
Thanks, you guys!
You're really great...
Shut up!
Look relaxed...
Gentlemen...
Could you help me?
I'm looking for a certain
Alphonse Tram.
I was told he lived
near here.
Sorry, we're strangers
in the area.
That path leads to
a village.
They could tell you.
Thank you, gentlemen,
most kind.
What did you want with
Alphonse Tram?
Just to kill him.
Oh really!
Should have said so.
It's him!
You bastards! I've got kids...
Sorry, Tram, I've got
a contract.
Thank you guys,
you saved me time.
Now I can catch the
6 o'clock train.
-Don't thank us too fast.
-Why?
We made a sucker
out of you too.
-Wasn't him?
-No!
That's no way to work!
What do I do now?
Put your hands above
your head.
Know who I am?
No.
Chief Insp. Morvandiaux
from Paris!
The Resistance hero?
In person.
Stop sniveling!
Walk on, your hands
on your head.
-My suitcase?
-Confiscated!
Damn it! I've just no luck!
That's life! Little guys
shouldn't hit big ones!
Now hitchhike! My feet hurt!
No one will stop! When they
see me, they speed up!
Do you go by train?
I like trains, and why not?
You like shacks?
What sort?
Stone, with cells and bars.
-I prefer woods.
-Make the most of it...
it's your last chance.
Who asked you to kill me?
No one.
An envelope in my mail box
one night.
An envelope?
With the cash and the name
of the guy to kill.
-Alphonse Tram?
-Tram or someone else...
he's not the only one
to get rid of!
Lots of guys are being
killed, right now!
What interests me is why
someone wants to kill me!
-Is it you?
-Yes.
Then you have enemies.
But who? Where are they?
I'd like to know my enemies.
Forget it, he's an amateur,
doesn't understand.
A pity, he's nice, but he'll
fall into the first trap.
Good afternoon... forgive me
for bothering you.
I've been arrested.
Could you take us to the
nearest station?
If you like...
Does your car often behave
like this?
Yes, the bottom of the tank
is always dirty.
You've run out of gas?
It'll soon be empty.
You take a deserted road, no
house nearby and no gasoline?
Got some reserve?
No, nothing.
Congratulations!
Right on a bridge!
We'll discuss it later.
Don't stay here, got to move!
If a truck comes along,
we get it head on!
What's going on?
Push!
That idiot jumped!
He won't go far!
Aim at him!
I am aiming, damn it!
-The bastard!
-He got away with it!
We can't let him escape!
A killer!
-Any ideas?
-Well, cut the escape route!
-What with?
-"What with?"
Think of something!
You never have any ideas!
Perhaps he'll drown...
You kidding! Look, he's
swimming better and better.
He's a guy who'll make
his destination!
He'll reach the shore...
then start chasing
after Alphonse Tram!
Don't I have the right to
rest a bit?
Take a boat.
Boat? There isn't one!
Nothing! A desert!
A mile downstream there's
a beach and boats...
How do we get there, no gas,
no car!
Keep cool, Alphonse...
Don't you touch me!
Mademoiselle,
must know a way.
You got dizzy?
Then follow me.
Not even a gun!
-Got your knife?
-I've got it.
A great opportunity
to use it!
Right! Right!
There, to the left!
Straight ahead...
Faster! Damn it...
I'm at full speed!
Shall I take over?
No thanks...
Go on, go on...
I've got him, go on!
Are you going to throw it!
There, I've got him...
Did you see that?
No slip-up, nice and clean!
Get back a bit, I must get
my knife before he sinks...
You don't need your knife.
Yes, go on, he's sinking!
My knife!
You can buy another knife!
It won't be the same!
Move over, I'll row!
Don't be an idiot,
I can't swim!
-You can't swim?
-No!
-Shouldn't have said so!
-Why?
Because I'll push you in.
-No!
-Oh yes!
That's another job
out of the way...
Now we can get going...
I couldn't help it,
if I hadn't pushed him...
he'd have pushed me.
You can't swim either?
Of course not!
Can't do anything.
Anything I do, fails!
Should I row, then?
It would be wiser.
Here... take my place...
So, you'll row...
and I will look at you.
All right?
If you like...
No, it's a fact...
we were a bit pressed by
events, I didn't have time...
but now I can tell you.
I like you...
Really?
I think you're
extraordinarily beautiful.
What are you waiting for?
What for?
I don't know...
A beautiful woman,
you take her in your arms...
Yes, of course... Yes...
But you intimidate me.
Really?
Yes.
Usually I'm more the
active type...
but, it's strange...
There's something serious
about you.
Something sad perhaps,
it scares me.
Are you sad, right now?
I'd rather not talk
about it!
Yes!
You can tell me about it!
I understand these things.
I'm a friend!
What's the matter?
I'm cold...
Me too... I'm cold.
For weeks, I've been cold.
Are you in mourning?
Yes.
My wife...
For my father.
Really?
Yes.
He was murdered, knifed
in the stomach...
in the subway.
You know who did it?
Of course, if not
I wouldn't be here.
Oh, no, damn it!
It's starting all over!
Enough guns, enough
nightmares!
I want to live normally for
a while! 5 minutes!
I didn't kill your father.
I had nothing to do with it.
I swear!
On whose head?
Listen, Mademoiselle...
Just be reasonable...
You're not going to shoot?
Oh, yes.
No, I don't agree!
I don't want to die!
I'm too afraid!
I'm afraid of dying!
You're wrong, there's
nothing to it.
They make a big fuss, just
let yourself go.
Just let yourself go...
Listen! You're beautiful!
We're almost the same age.
Let's try it together
for a while.
Hand in hand!
