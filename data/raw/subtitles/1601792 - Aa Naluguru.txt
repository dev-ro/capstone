"Those four!"
Dear... dear...
I'm calling you only.
I said yes, go ahead.
I'm not getting sleep.
Why are you hesitating?
Put your hand...
Trust me, I'm not getting sleep.
Dear...
I never expected you'll get
an open top. - Open top?
Bald head.
I never expected
you'll go bald.
What if I'm bald now?
If I knew you'll go bald,
would I've married you?
Now that I'm bald,
will you divorce me?
I would've divorced you,
but getting a partner at this
age is little difficult.
That's why I'm in a dilemma.
True! Who will marry
you at this age?
I didn't mean a partner
for me but for you.
Hey, leave me.
Actually you're responsible
for my baldness. Leave me.
Sorry.
Why feel sorry now?
I'm already bald.
The sorry wasn't for it.
- But why?
I gave you a lot of trouble,
the sorry was for that.
From tomorrow
I'll make you cry.
You can never do that.
Bharathi, I'm not getting sleep,
put your hand on me.
Hey Katakata!
- Tell me, Takataka!
Calling me by name?
I didn't call you by name,
I told you, tell me fast what you
want to say. That's all!
Hey Hell boy!
Why are you blabbering?
I swear on our Lord,
I'll cut your throat.
Okay, you can do it later,
but do your duty first.
I'll see... l'll see...
how you'll work?
The life we must take now
is in this body only.
Why are you hesitating?
Come, let's take his life quickly.
Stop!
The labour pain a mother goes
through to deliver her child,
soul too goes through the
same pain to leave a body.
So take a firm foothold and
then pull out the soul.
Only then the soul will come
out from the body.
But looking at his face tells me,
we needn't take much trouble.
Just a pat to wake him and
he'll reach hell before us.
Are you challenging my long
years of experience?
Look at my horns,
they are bigger than yours.
But has very little brain.
Don't get angry.
Sometimes my ideas are sharper
than your horn. - Is it?
Then wake him up.
If the soul wakes up on your pat,
I'll give anything you ask.
If you lose, you should
never go against me.
As you say.
I've won! L've won!
...l've won!
Shut up! Stop jumping,
I accept you've won.
Make your wish,
I'll grant it.
Now I don't have any wish,
but I'll make the wish
some other time.
Okay, as you wish.
Mr. Raghuram, you are dead.
Come, let's go to our world.
Am I dead...?
Yes, you are dead.
She'll not hear your shouts.
Have you understood now?
You are dead. Come, let's go.
What about me?
- Where're you going? Come, let's go.
Wow! The sun is rising!
You've gone down! Come!
Stop men! Let me see it
for sometime.
I always loved to
see the rising sun.
Where are you going?
You may kiss just
because you like it.
Even Lord Hanuman hasn't
recovered till now.
Oh! My wife is crying!
Why are you so surprized?
Won't your wife cry on your death?
Come, let's go.
Let's go... but I've a little request,
you must fulfill it.
We are not angels
to fulfill wishes.
Moreover gods are no jokes.
You've to do great penance to
make them appear and get boons.
But we appear though you
don't do any penance.
Though we appear, we are not
powerful enough to grant boons.
No sir, they say you need atleast
four people as pallbearers,
Now I'm dead.
Four people who have come
to carry my body,
I wish to hear them,
what they talk & how they look.
We feel like going away from
here immediately, come.
Come, let's go.
- Come. - Sir!
Stop sir!
I'm dead for the first time,
I'll lose my relationship with
this world from today.
I wish to see
my funeral procession.
Let's stay here till they
lit pyre to my body,
please fulfill my last wish.
This is not your last wish,
this is your first wish
after your death.
Moreover there's no end
to man's wishes.
The moment one is fulfilled,
a new wish follows.
We can't fulfill any of your wish,
come on get going... move...
Guru, he has made a strange wish.
Let him see it.
What will happen?
Why are you blabbering?
- Guru!
If there's any delay,
I owe an explanation to Lord Yama.
Guru... - What?
Many have asked this
as their last wish,
ever since I've joined as
the messenger of death,
I've not seen any funeral procession,
I too have a strong
desire to see, guru.
Why don't you listen to me?
Guru, you lost the bet
a little while ago and I won.
This is my wish, you have
to fulfill it. That's all!
That's all? - Yes.
Then, as you wish.
I think you are very anxious
before reaching hell,
watch the hell here only.
Thank you very much for
accepting my request.
Look, how much my wife loves me.
Look, how she's crying
over my death.
Why are you laughing?
- Nothing...
First time we're seeing a wife
who loves her husband so much.
Husband's body is
still in the house,
she's eating upma
in the kitchen,
what else can we do other than laugh.
- What's wrong if she eats?
Eating upma doesn't mean
she doesn't love her husband.
You need energy to cry also.
Anyway you are defending
your wife very well.
We'll tell just like that whether
your wife loves you or not,
just answer our questions.
Is yours arranged marriage
or love marriage?
Arranged marriage.
Did you take dowry or not?
I did take dowry.
- That's it!
Any wife will be angry on her
husband who takes dowry.
The anger comes out on
such occasions only.
Oh No! You've mistaken me.
I had taken dowry under
a different circumstance.
What's that circumstance?
Bride knows music very well.
She's a good singer.
- Stop!
I like the girl,
I don't want any dowry.
I'm thinking of getting married
in a Registrar's Office.
My son always had
modern thoughts.
He wants to marry
without taking dowry.
He's a role model to
the new generation.
The bride wants to talk
to the groom.
I thought you were orthodox
looking at your dress.
You are a modern girl.
- Come.
Don't start reciting poems
finding the girl alone.
All have left, we can talk now.
What did you study?
Mmm... M.A., Journalism.
Are you a man of modern thought?
I mean...
people around me... say so.
So, you don't know what you're
till people around tell you.
It's difficult with you.
Do you put your leg on person
sleeping next to you?
No... moreover till now I've never
slept next to anyone.
I've that habit. - What?
I used to sleep next
to my mother.
One more thing...
when I get angry,
I'll call informally.
If you get more angry.
- I'll call names.
If you get furious in anger.
I'll strangle the neck
under my feet.
Do you've any objections?
What's there to object after
my neck is under your feet?
Do you like me?
I mean... you've extreme thoughts...
Jingoistic thoughts...
Don't prolong it.
- I like you.
Can I ask a question?
- You can.
We never met earlier.
What's your idea in calling me
informally on seeing me?
Is this your first time
to meet a bride? - Yes.
This is my 100th proposal.
I got vexed respecting every
fool who came to see me.
Why did you refuse
to take dowry?
I'm against dowry.
- Stop it!
Is it to boast later that you
didn't take dowry to marry me?
Marrying me without taking dowry
like a man of modern thought,
you needn't give any life to me.
Moreover we are not poor,
we are comfortable
to some extent.
So, I'll marry giving you dowry.
I'll marry you,
only if you take dowry.
I'll call all of them inside.
You must accept before
them of taking dowry.
Or else I'll refuse this proposal.
Okay.
That's it! I had to take dowry.
After hearing you,
I'm not surprised that your
wife is eating upma.
When she bossed over him on
the day he came to see her,
won't she eat on his death?
My daughter!
My daughter too loves me!
Indra! How did your father die?
- I don't know!
When did he died?
- I don't know!
Did he have any heart attack?
Oh! Heart attack or angry on us?
Why don't you listen if I
say he died in his sleep?
What's this man?
Even his daughter abhors him.
I think daughter is more
educated than his wife.
How can she not abhor him?
You've mistaken.
How does she know
how I had died?
She's just a little girl.
Did you want to see this & made a wish
to be here till consumed to fire?
Look there!
My close friend Subrahmanyam
is coming.
So what?
He too loves you very much?
Yes. - Oh?
My Subbu loves me very much.
Our friendship is great.
He was always with me
through thick and thin.
But why hasn't he come
along with you now?
He'll be sad for my early death
and not coming along with me.
Now watch! He'll cry his
heart out falling on my body.
Cry his heart out?
Let's watch it.
It's me Subbu speaking...
- Tell me...
Come immediately
to Raghuram's house.
Why? What happened?
Atlast our Raghuram has
done a good thing.
What?
He has died.
He never did anything
better than this.
Come immediately.
You said he's your bosom friend.
You said he'll cry his heart out
falling on your body.
Did you hear what he said?
It seems you did a
good thing by dying.
No... I had a little tiff with
him before my death.
I think he still has a grouse,
otherwise he's always
affectionate on me.
Stop it!
Why are you lying?
Are we not seeing the love
your people have on you?
Enough of watching it,
come let's go. - Come...
Sir... one more small request.
There are neighbours and friends,
let's wait till they too come.
What's this man?
Even after all this
haven't you got sense?
When people in your home
don't love you?
How can neighbours
and friends love you?
Not a soul will come to
pay respects to your body.
You would've done all useless
things when you were alive.
That's why you have died unwept.
That's why people say...
be good to four people
and love four people.
I think you've failed to do it.
Who will be your pallbearers
and who will lit pyre to you?
You've mistaken me.
I had done the same
till I was alive.
I loved everyone and
shared love with them.
What's it man?
When you love them,
why will they not reciprocate it?
They say money rules man's life.
But I say it's love.
I didn't listen to them.
They didn't listen to me.
I had this trouble
with them all my life.
Anyway, who won the duel?
You or they?
To know the winner,
you've to wait till
my body is cremated.
You must know my story.
O Lord Rama, lord of Seetha!
Liberate us!
Blue complexioned Lord!
Take us in the
right path, Adi Sankara!
Another day has dawned
for you and me...
Happiness and enthusiasm
is flowing out from the heart...
Open the doors to the heart...
Remove the curtains
of differences...
Invite the first rays
of a new dawn...

Hey! You want to die man!?
I want an auto please.
You come. - Get in.
Please make him sit inside.
Please sit inside the auto.
Sit... sit... don't run away.
Listen to me... don't run...
You?!
You too come... you too come...
I'll come.
You too come...
I'll come...
- You too come
I've come to know you've
adopted ten patients here,
and taking care of them.
Who are you sir?
- Me?
I'm District Collector.
Don't say that aloud.
They have brought me
here for saying that.
There is no good man
in this world than you...
Hypocrites who act like good
are the real mad people...
Mad after money,
mad after power...
We don't need it friends...
Madness of deception which
has inflicted mankind...
Madness of destruction...
madness of hatred...
It's out of bounds in this fort...
You are the Supreme Lords!
Laugh... laugh...
Teach us also...
Sun has left bidding adieu...
He woke up the world
on the other side...
Stop fearing the darkness...
Let's dream about
tomorrow's morning...
Good night to everyone.
Father... shampoo!
- I've brought son.
Spread your palm correctly or
else the drop may fall down.
What's this father?
Give me a drop or two more.
If I give one more drop...
What should last a week
will be over in a day.
When I was of your age,
I used to take head bath for
a week with one soap nut.
What?
Did you take head bath also?
My son has started
making fun of me.
Nobody is there to stop him.
Even if a drop falls,
it'll fall into the shell,
we can take bath by
washing the shell clean.
Father... Horlicks!
It's not even two months old
and it's already half empty.
Horlicks... you're a minus and
moreover heath drink to you.
Father, I'll not take it easy
if you call me minus.
Why are you getting so angry?
Will anyone call a minus
as plus instead of minus?
Milk is getting cold,
add horlicks first.
Already you are drinking milk,
why do you need
horlicks with it?
Horlicks is added
to milk isn't it?
Always in the mood of
eating and drinking,
never bothers to read
the lable on the bottle.
What is written on it?
Horlicks can be added
to plain water also. I mean...
no need to add Horlicks
if you drink milk,
no need to take milk
if you take Horlicks.
You can claim on TV,
Horlicks is the secret of my energy.
Hubby... I need cumin seeds
for seasoning.
Can't you make one
request for everything?
How many times do I've to
open and close the cupboard?
Who told you to lock
and open it?
Will anyone lock up
food items like money?
Shut up!
You are going overboard
the more I keep quiet.
Sir, Mastan Bhai is here.
- Mastan Bhai here?
What has brought you
here Mastan Bhai?
Greeting sir...
I came for a loan.
Loan?
Have you come for a loan?
What's that emergency need?
Indeed it's an emergency.
People take loans under
pretexts like this...
you don't know about it.
Needs force you
to take loans...
If you fail to repay,
it'll bring disgrace also.
I've told you it's
an emergency need.
Advising you is my duty,
then it's up to you. Come.
You'll get Rs.2 lakhs for the
jewels you've pawned.
Take it.
In the witness of Allah,
I've taken a loan of
Rs.2 lakhs from Kotaiah.
Thank you.
- God bless you.
What's the surprize dad?
- Wait and see.
Did he ask for a bike?
It's a thrill when you get
it before asking for it.
How can he know it's value if you
present him before he asks?
Have you started irritating again?
Your bike is very good.
Suri, your father never
gives you money,
how did you get a new bike?
Do you know how much
hard work I did to get this?
You?
Where did you work hard man?
Where else, at home.
Work hard at home?
- What else then?
Do you know how difficult it is
to steal my father's savings?
You'll never come good in life.
Hey Watch out!
It's a new bike!
I think he has decided
to kill himself.
Pull over the vehicle...
pull over. Come... come.
I saw my dad's face
on waking up.
Do you've RC?
- No sir.
Do you've license?
- No sir.
Do you've Insurance?
- No sir.
What do you've then?
I've a hundred rupee note.
Go... go now...
- We'll go sir...
But I've a question,
will you answer honestly?
What is it?
What's your daily income?
If you give another Rs.100,
I'll tell you.
Why not sir? I'll give.
How much sir?
You shouldn't ask a Policeman's
income and wife's age,
and I shouldn't tell you.
I don't want your wife's age,
but I know your income.
You know it, don't you?
Get going.
If we get Policeman's job,
we can mint money.
Hey! Trouble has erupted!
Come, let's go. - Where?
Come, let's go and
cut their limbs.
Let's hack them...
you go ahead...
I'll park my scooter and come.
Hey! Bring the vegetable knife...
I've to go with them. - Okay...
What son?
Where you going son
with a stick?
Where else? Shouldn't I go when
they are calling us?
Where do you want to go?
Shut up & walk into the house.
If he goes out of the house,
I'll break your legs
Take him in.
My foot! A great savior
has born here!
Oh My god! Somebody's house is
on fire in the next street.
Instead of standing there
and watching the fun,
can't you all get a bucket of
water and wet the walls?
Have you gone mad?
Why are you wetting our walls
when a house is on fire elsewhere?
Think future!
What if a speck of fire
falls on our house?
He'll never change.
Stop!
Why are you saving Muslims?
I'm saving humans,
not their religion.
No brother, they have killed
ten Hindus in Old city.
Do you know that?
Just because ten Hindus
were killed there,
will you kill ten Muslims here?
Then kill me first!
Oh! Will you kill only Muslims?
Now I'm also a Muslim...
this is my family...
she's my mother...
he's my brother...
they are all my children...
Kill me now... kill me!
Why have you stopped?
Brother...
you don't know anything...
move aside...
let's burn them alive.
What have they done
to get burnt alive?
Did Mastan Bhai harm
you personally?
Did he harm you?
Did he harm you?
Mastan Bhai didn't do anything,
but his religion did.
No, you are doing it.
Smoking cigarettes,
not only spoiling your health,
you are spoiling the health
of people around you also.
Why are you linking
cigarette with religion?
This is my habit.
Even religion is a habit.
In our country 200 millions
are smoking cigarettes,
they are spoiling their health
and people around them also.
When we tolerate
such a bad habit,
why shouldn't we tolerate
a habit known as religion?
A human killing another
human is mental illness.
For god's sake,
don't rub it on any religion.
No religion preaches
to kill another human.
If such a religion had been there,
Mankind would've become extinct.
Brother... what happened?
Indra, pumpkins are crying
here instead of onions.
That's all right!
Have you finished writing?
It's almost over mother.
Isn't it Boost?
I'll give it.
Enough of building muscles,
drink this Boost.
No need. I'll not drink.
Volga
Looks like you're writing
something seriously,
please drink this Boost.
For asking her to drink Boost,
she's looking at me like a ghost.
No use here.
This boy is right.
Chinna! You look tired
working out Maths.
Please drink this Boost.
- I'll not drink.
Actually I don't want
to talk to you.
I've been watching,
I'm hurt and people at home are
on a non co-operation movement.
Why will you not drink?
Drink!
If you don't drink,
I'll kill you.
Drink... drink... fool!
Wipe your mouth...
do your Maths.
Chinna, drink this Boost.
I don't want. He made me
drink sugarless coffee.
I've to brush again to clean
my mouth of it's bitter taste.
That sugarless coffee
was for you.
Mummy, I've finished writing it.
Read it carefully and sign,
if you agree to it.
If I don't agree?
We'll fend for ourselves.
Has it reached that stage?
To you... I mean to Mr. Raghuram,
We, I mean family members,
an agrament...
between us...
Agrament?
What's that?
Don't you know the spelling of
"agreement" also? Give me the pen.
A-G-R-E-E-M-E-N-T!
No use in correcting
that spelling,
first correct your fate.
He's an editor, isn't he?
He'll only correct the proofs,
but never cares to
know what is in it.
Is it for me?
- No.
Give it to me, I'll read.
To you... it means to Mr. Raghuram,
We, means family members,
an agreement between us,
I, known as Raghuram,
hereafter interfere in
matters concerning house,
and office only,
I'll not interfere in other
matters and other's matters,
I promise not to get
involved in street fights,
and hurt myself seriously,
and I swear it in the witness
of all my family members.
By, Raghuram.
Sign it!
Sign it!
- Why should I sign?
Won't you sign as the witness?
- You sign it first.
Never again behave
foolishly like this.
You've done a great job!
You didn't just save Mastan's home,
you saved mine too.
How come?
It seems you doused your house
with water before hand.
Keep quiet man.
You are a trouble.
If Mastan had died in yesterday's
communal clashes,
I would've lost Rs.2 lakhs.
Because I've lent him Rs.2 lakhs.
I thank you once again
for saving his life.
Do one thing in future,
you insure anyone who
takes loan from you.
Even if he dies you'll
get back your loan.
I'm not that intelligent,
if he repays the loan
while he's still alive,
won't I lose money
paying his premiums?
It seems you bled heavily,
infact I thought of
donating my blood,
mine is B negative,
it doesn't match yours.
What? Is your blood group
B negative? - Yes.
Someone in General Hospital
needs it very urgently,
come, let's go.
- I disclosed it at wrong time.
You've brought to light starvation
deaths of farmers in remote area.
Volga
Sir, Chairman is calling you.
Go on, I'll join you.
A fashion parade is scheduled
tomorrow in Grand Canyon,
these International models,
must appear on
tomorrow's front page.
These photos in our
papers' front page?
This fashion show is not great news
than farmers' starvation deaths.
I can't publish it.
Starvation deaths are routine,
publish these photos,
lt'll add beauty and
we'll get money too.
Hunger is stark pain,
it'll never be beautiful.
Encouraging these for
beauty and money is...
Tell me one thing,
are you running this paper
for moral values or money?
Just holding on to moral values
we can't run paper.
If you can't then shut it down.
Yes, no need of a paper that
can't keep up moral values.
It's a waste! Close it.
Money may survive in a immoral place,
but I can't survive.
I'm resigning!
Volga
What?
You've come to bed very early.
You visit your younger wife first.
- Younger wife?
Oh Younger wife!
I've divorced her.
Divorced? Why?
I've resigned from my job.
God! Why did you resign suddenly?
Don't worry, I've applied
for another job,
I'll get it in one month.
Will you be free
all this month then?
Why would I be free?
I'll do a better job
from tomorrow.
What job will you
get in a day?
Appadalu... mouth watering!
- No need.
Madam, please buy Appadalu.
Appadalu, madam.
- What is it?
Beautiful Appadalu.
- No need.
Madam, please buy Appadalu.
Appadalu madam. Beautiful Appadalu.
- No need. - Appadalu...
Oldman! You mustn't sell here.
This is my area.
Your area?
Yes, from that bus stop
to this place,
only I'll sell,
you shouldn't sell here.
Why shouldn't I?
I'll sell here only.
You sell yours and I'll sell mine.
Oldman! You are not
listening to my words.
I'll complain to Karim Bhai.
If you tell Karim Bhai,
I'll tell... mind it!
You look like a gentleman,
will you spoil my livelihood
by selling your wares here?
Go and sell on the other road,
I'll not trespass
into your area,
you don't trespass
into my area. Okay?
Okay... okay... this is right.
I'll sell there only.
What a man I met early morning!
Appadalu madam.
Will you please give me your
expensive few minutes?
Tell me.
Green gram, black gram
and rice flour,
have you ever eaten a dish
with all these together?
What are you talking about man?
I've a tasty product
with these ingredients.
What is it?
Appadalu!
- Appadalu?
Yes, a pack is just Rs. 10 only.
Please try it once.
You appear like a gentleman.
Will you narrate such a
long tale for selling this?
Do you think I've no other work?
Go away from here.
Madam... Appadalu please...
- No need please.
Green gram, black gram
and rice flour,
if you mix all the three...
What will be the result?
Go away... l'm very busy.
You've grown old but still don't
know how to sell Appadalu?
Who taught you man?
Why are you bothered
about ingredients?
No one will buy your words.
Watch me and learn to sell.
Madam... Appadalu... tasty food...
Taste it once and
pay only if you like it.
One pack is just Rs.10 only,
you can pay tomorrow also.
No need to come back again
for Rs.10, take it.
Take two packs,
pay a rupee less.
Great boy! Okay, take it.
I don't have one rupee change,
I'll pay tomorrow.
Promise madam.
I've understood your cleverness,
but keep the rupee also.
Understood now, how to sell it?
I got it boy! Come sir.
Sit here sir.
What are your parents doing?
If I had parents, why would
I be selling on streets?
I don't have anyone.
Are you an orphan?

Home made Appadalu madam.
Crispy Appadalu madam...
Crispy Appadalu madam!
Taste a sample.
Serve your husband,
he'll have a go at food.
No need of vegetables
or any side dish,
you can finish dinner
with just one piece.
Cost of a pack?
Rs. 10 madam.
My husband too is
a salesman like you.
Now tell me,
what will it cost to me?
Let it be anyone,
no discount!
One pack is Rs. 10!
Boss! Who are they?
Why are you talking to them?
Did you sell everything?
Sold out but just two packs
are remaining...
if they settle for the price,
I'll sell it.
Boss, their faces show
they'll not buy,
take the two packs
to your home.
If comment on us,
I'll smash your face, idiot.
Take Rs. 20! Come.
Why are you gaping, boss?
This is a sales technic.
- You're genius!
Greetings Mr. Raghuram.
- Greetings madam.
Please come.
It seems you had called my office.
- Yes.
He's the boy about
whom I told you.
Look after him carefully.
- Okay.
I'll make a regular visit.
- Okay.
They will take you with them,
they will feed you
three times a day,
they will give good clothes
and educate you.
Will they educate me?
- Yes.
Promise? Truly?
They will teach and
play with you.
What about my business?
You've taught me the
business, haven't you?
I'll take care of the business,
you go with them.
I'll go but tell me,
who are you?
I'm your friend, Raghuram.
Study well.
- Come son.
Go.
Bye. I'll take leave,
you'll visit me often, won't you?
Definitely! Take him carefully.
- Bye sir.
Bye sir.
Volga
Will you misbehave with a
girl in the fashion show?
Irresponsible son!
No dad...
- Shut up!
Stop it sir.
Teach morals to your son later,
first bring a change in you.
What is this?
You can print such dirty pictures
on the front page,
but expect your son
to be good boy?
First introspect yourself.
If you print such dirty,
shameless photos,
not only your son,
any father's son will get spoiled.
First protect the values
of your news paper,
and then teach morals
to others.
Volga
Money may survive
in immoral places,
I can't survive.
I'm resigning.
Appadalu is very tasty.
- Really? Then enjoy your food happily.
I don't find any other dishes
other than this.
It seems you can finish dinner
with one piece. Eat!
Who said that?
- A salesman.
Why didn't you prepare vegetables
on a salesman's advice?
Why are you calling
a salesman informally?
If he calls someone informally,
why are you beating him, mother?
You too are calling him informally,
it's wrong, don't do it.
What am I to call that fool
for giving such lousy idea?
Ask him, he'll tell you.
Why should we ask father
about that fool?
That salesman is none
other than our father.
Did you sell it in market?
How insulting it would be
if anyone had seen it?
What's there to feel insult in it?
- Shut up!
When you said you'll
find a job in a day,
I didn't expect you to do such
a thing to bring disrepute.
How can you call it as disrepute?
Till yesterday, I took care
of you all as an Editor,
from today I'll take care
of you as a salesman.
Whether I'm an editor
or a salesman,
there will be no change
in looking after you.
But why are you bothered
about the change in my job?
It's wrong to take loan or
earn through bad ways,
you must see
the dignity of labour.
Got it?
Got it.
Got it very well.
You'll convince us
with your arguments,
you'll never change your attitude.
Attitude is like wife,
changing it often is bad.
You? Please come in sir.
I was wrong.
Please sit children.
Hereafter your word is mine.
I'll never interfere again
in your profession.
So, you must continue
as the editor.
Nothing doing, you're coming
to office from tomorrow.
He'll not come tomorrow,
tomorrow is my birthday.
You must attend office
from day after tomorrow.
Crisps are fine,
where did you buy it?

Lord! I've donated 25 paise
according to my capacity,
take it as Rs.100 and 1000,
bless me it turns
into billions, Lord.
Priest, make a good heavy offering,
I didn't have breakfast.
Offering is nothing,
for your generosity,
I'll send food to your entire family.
Even a beggar will return it.
You carry on priest.
You may go.
Priest, today it's my
daughter's birthday,
offer special prayers for her.
- Okay.
What's her name?
Race?
- Paidipala.
What's our next program?
There's an Italian food festival
going on in Shilparamam.
Let's eat there.
- Okay, let's go.
No need.
Let's go home.
I'll cook whatever you ask.
I know what will you prepare.
Pudding, Vada and
Tamarind rice, that's all!
Yes dad, mother always
prepares the same things.
Recently for Telugu new year,
same three items!
For Lord Ganesha's birthday,
same three items!
When we have some guests,
again same three items!
For Indra's birthday,
you'll prepare same three items!
Pudding, Vada and
Tamarind rice!
Bloody fool!
I prepared flour laddus
for your birthday.
I prepared sweet souffle
for his birthday.
Have you forgotten
it so easily?
My mother!
I haven't forgotten anything.
Father, they were not flour
laddus but stone laddus.
Do you know what my
friends did with it?
What did they do?
- They played cricket.
Didn't it break?
- It did break.
What?
- Bat...
Making fun of my culinary skills!
Stop I say...
Stop... stop...
- You please move aside.
No war please!
Let's do one thing,
today it's her birthday,
so, let's do as she says.
...l'm getting her
medically treated...
I think she'll live little
long with your mercy.
Now people like you are collecting
money with fake diseases.
Oh! I'm not a cheat like them.
I swear on god! My daughter
is really a cancer patient.
If you've any doubt check
the doctor's certificates.
Certificates? People are printing
counterfeit notes by morning.
Is it so difficult to produce
these certificates?
She had to have a
chemotherapy in two days,
please donate whatever
you feel like.
I've not heard anything, how can you
ask me whatever I feel like giving?
Go away... anyway she's
going to die...
Take it madam.
- Listen to me, don't give.
Don't believe her words.
- You take it madam.
Take it madam.
Even god can't help you.
Volga
What's this?
We were planning to
spend the day happily.
Do you've to donate all the
money on her birthday too?
If you deny children of their little
wishes also, will they love you?
If you spoil their fun,
do you know how
much they are hurt?
What's this your eccentricity?
Infact it was disgusting
to see them.
We would've spent the day happily
with money given to the girl.
Will our Rs.1000
alter their lives?
Volga
What did you say?
Will Rs.1000 alter lives?
Sometimes even 10 paise
will save a life.
This 10 paise postcard
saved my mother's life,
and taught me about life.
Like your mother loves you,
my mother too loved
me very much.
When I lost my father as a boy,
my mother struggled very
hard to educate me.
When I was in college,
my mother's health deteriorated,
both her kidneys failed.
Doctors suggested surgery.
I didn't have money.
I must save mother.
But how?
This letter came from a remote
village near Madurai in Tamil Nadu.
Informing about a charitable
institution in Bangalore,
which conducts
free operations.
I took my mother there
without any further delay.
They did a free operation,
my mother survived.
I'm surprized that this
letter has saved my life.
The person who wrote this is
neither a friend nor a relative,
infact not from our state also.
We don't know their face also.
May be this is known as Humanity!
Son, you must meet the god
who wrote this in Madurai.
For just a letter they had
performed a free operation,
I thought the person would
be rich and powerful.
But my thoughts were wrong,
I understood when I saw the
simple and peaceful home,
Sir, I've come to meet
Mr. Swaminathan here...
Mr. Swaminathan...
You can meet him later,
first give me that towel.
Volga
I've come from Hyderabad,
I want to meet Mr. Swaminathan.
Do you know English?
Read these news papers,
you'll know who is
in which problem.
Check with this reference book,
it has details about which
institution will help them.
After that write letters to them.
To whom?
- Fool!
Find which social organisation will
help the affected in which way.
Got it?
That means...
you are Mr. Swaminathan.
I'll go out and come back.
Meanwhile you write letters and
post them in the opposite box.
Where are you going sir?
I'm a clerk in Railways.
Bye.
I went to thank him.
But I understood
how he accepts it,
by making me
write few letters.
A caption there attracted
me very much.
I believe in mankind.
I love them,
I respect them.
Because of little selfishness
that I'm also a human.
After reading it,
a little desire sprouted in me,
I was in ecstasy that the
world belonged to me.
Ever since then I love my family
and the world alike,
I'll do so in future also.
I spend half of
my earnings to home,
and other half to the society.
If Swaminathan hadn't bothered
about society that day,
I wouldn't be now your
father and an editor.
I wanted you to
understand society,
that's why I made you to donate money,
not to spoil your happiness.
Volga
Daddy, come and see
what mother is up to. Come daddy.
What's it dear?
- Did you see mother?
She has grown 10 years younger!
Really!
There's treacherous plan
behind this, dad.
Traitor! How dare to
cheat your husband?
Dad, we must avenge this cheating.
- Avenge?
Come Daddy, I'll tell you.
I'll bring a 20 year difference
between you and mother. Sit.
Sit here.
- Oh No dear!
If you don't dye your hair,
we'll be like your elder
and younger daughters.
You think like that?
- Yes.
Okay... do it... do it...
What's there do dye?
Come on do it.
Father, sign here.
I'm applying to join as SI.
Do you want to join
Police department?
Thanks father.
Chinna! - Yes father.
How did you write
your EAMCET exams?
I did very well daddy.
Will you get the rank
in thousands or lakhs?
I'll get within 100 ranks daddy.
Happy to hear it.
Yeah! Tell me.
That's...
I'll coming right now.
Daddy, I've special class,
I'm going to attend it.
All right...
go and attend dear...
Why are you so late?
Did you see the time now?
It's like fighting death to cheat
my dad and come out, you know?
Is your father a demon?
No, he's very good man.
Why do you fear him then?
Nothing... if he comes
to now about us,
I'm worried about his reaction.
Why your hand is coloured?
I was applying
hair dye to my father.
You did apply dye perfectly.
Look son,
I don't want my daughter
to lie to meet you.
Sir that's...
Nothing, I don't have much
hair to dye it everyday.
Tell me about your parents,
I'll talk to them and
arrange your marriage.
Dad, we are still in the
process of knowing each other,
we haven't thought
about marriage yet.
Still getting to know each other?
Father, not like that...
- Don't utter one more word,
you both just follow me.
Come... come...
Come and sit here.
Why are you feeling
like a stranger?
Sit down.
Open place...
it's pleasant here...
No disturbance.
You can be free and get to
know each other very well.
After college,
come straight to home.
Don't go to any park.
I don't like people seeing
my daughter in park,
and pass dirty comments
about her.
Look son...
No need to decide right now,
it's enough if you tell me after you
get to know each other very well.
Leave my hair!
What are you doing now?
You saw it, didn't you get it?
Forget about knowing it,
I may go mad for it.
On finding her with
a boy friend in park,
instead of breaking her limbs
and bringing her home,
will you ask her to love in home
instead of going to parks?
They are not in love,
they are just in the process of
getting to know each other.
Oh! My god!
When they have decided
to meet secretly in park,
what's there still to know
about each other? My foot!
You come with me.
Why do you get
tensed up unnecessarily?
Do you remember?
Your parents got you married to me
without knowing about me,
you were angry on your parents,
as the new bride!
I haven't understood you yet!
That's my grouse!
Grouse! I don't want my daughter
to have the same grouse.
So, I did like this.
Oh God!
Is it necessary to run
to catch thieves?
How can you catch them
if you don't run?
To catch thieves?
Infact I belong to
a gang of thieves.
If I run to catch myself,
people may think I'm mad.
I can't run anymore,
you carry on.
Come...
You'll never prosper.
What's it son?
Leg?
Here?
Get up... get up.
Wear the shoe.
His father is really great.
Walk son,
nothing will happen to you.
Go... go...
Volga
Sign as the witness
on behalf of the bride.
Why didn't you apply
dye this time dear?
Last times' dye hasn't
faded out yet.
I think he's not the guy
I met in the park...
I didn't get to know him
very well, father.
Look Indra, now you're married,
after starting the family,
don't say you didn't get
to know him well.
Try to know him sincerely.
What do you do?
That's...
- Software professional, father.
Where are you working?
Not working presently,
have to find a job.
Did his parents agree
to this marriage?
I mean... ours is very
orthodox family...
they will not accept so easily.
Infact they will not allow
into house after marriage.
Volga
Come in.
Wait here only.
Your mother will come
to ward off evil.
Why are you watching TV?
Go and talk to them.
What has happened now?
Why are you so sad?
What else should happen?
When your daughter
is marrying a stranger,
instead of stopping it,
will you sign as witness
and bring them home?
Did Subrahmanyam tell you?
Let it be anyone,
I know what you did.
Don't cry...
Easy? What easy?
I can't take anything easy
in life like you.
Recently when you found
her with a boy friend,
you brought her home
and told her to love here.
Now ditching that boy,
she's marrying someone else,
instead of beating her,
will you conduct her
marriage yourself?
Bharathi, just think about
our first night.
I'm furious enough
to kill you,
and you're talking
something else.
Do you want to feel happy
thinking about honeymoon days?
Please don't cry.
Come and sit here.
Sit... sit here.
What did you say on our first night?
- What did I say?
I saw a leopard as
a prospective bride,
may be I've to see
a cannon now?
Why are you bringing milk
hiding under your sari?
It's not milk, it's the dowry
I promised you.
Yes.
Take it.
Can't I avoid it?
- Take it please.
Oh It's very heavy!
This is my savings
since I'm 10,
won't it be heavy?
How much will it be?
How do I know?
Break it open and count.
Oh! No!
If I break & start counting now,
it'll become dawn.
Let's count tomorrow morning.
You asked how much
is the dowry, didn't you?
Break it open now.
- No, let's open it tomorrow.
No, right now...
Really plenty of money!
Lt'll take long time
to count them,
please come and sleep.
Oh Sleeping? Leaving open
Goddess of wealth!
It's a sin.
Then start the count.
Do you like me?
I liked you,
that's why I married you.
Didn't you like any of those
100 prospective grooms?
If I had liked anyone,
why would I marry you?
If you hadn't liked me?
100 more prospective grooms
would've come to see me.
You married me
selecting from a 100.
But Indra,
befriending two or three,
she has married the man
she liked out of them.
Even if we arrange her marriage,
we've to bring few proposals,
arrange the meeting
of bride and groom,
and marry her to
the man she selects.
That's what she has done.
Our daughter has the capacity
to choose what she wants,
we must congratulate her,
not insult her.
Come... come and bless them.
Please come in.
Come in.
Why are you still dull?
You were dull that day for not
celebrating your birthday.
It doesn't matter if nobody
knows your birthday,
but you're married today,
marriage is a thing
people should know.
You must be very happy.
Kicking on my chest...
Horse riding on my back...
A little girl who played...
Look! How strangely
she has grown up...
and our daughter has
become a bride now...
This is a time of happiness...
This is a garland
of felicitations...
We think we are doing all this...
It's all humbug...
If god marries them in heaven
and sends as couples...
why should we celebrate
once again grandly?
When people like you
are changing fates...
To tell the world,
marriage is not a joke...
Tying those three knots and
take seven steps together...
That isn't the marriage...
Hearts must unite...
Be a companion for all the life...
Only then it is happy marriage...
My husband used to call me
as 'Gold' when I was a new bride...
Now he calls me a Granary.
If you eat anything everyday...
won't you get averse to it?
Once you lose
interest in family...
won't it become a bore to you?
There are just 7 basic notes
for millions of tunes...
One must develop interest
to sing new tunes...
Like researching music...
research fun in life...
And lead a happy family life...
There will be days of
good and bad...
Ever chase of sorrows
and happiness...
All together is the
life of happiness...
Beautiful... full of sweet...
Life is a boon...
It must go on like
a song and a game...
Pleasing... enchanting...
A life of togetherness...
Let this moment become eternal...
Marriage is over.
Don't think about future
and get worried.
Go on a honeymoon
for a week.
Take it.
Take it, son-in-law.
Don't leave anything,
throw everything out.
Dents will reduce it's value,
keep it safely.
Sir, please stop!
We beg you sir.
I'll settle your loan sir.
Give me a month's time sir.
People may think,
you're honest.
What you couldn't
settle in 3 years,
can you settle it in a month?
How can you do it?
This will not work out,
clear out!
You go away madam,
ladies' sentiment will
not work on me...
Please sir, don't throw us
out on to the streets.
Did I throw you on streets?
After taking loan,
you're living happily at home.
As the lender,
I'm on the streets,
begging you to repay
my loan immediately.
Who has thrown whom
to the streets?
Please do justice to me.
Kotaiah, why are you pushing
him to the streets?
He's living here for
the past 10 years,
he'll definitely repay you.
Even the loan is 10 year old...
how can he repay?
If you've so much mercy on him,
you settle his loan.
If a situation comes,
I'll definitely do.
What more I need now!
Hey, bring those documents.
Throw all the things
into the house.
What's this man?
- Please sign as the guarantor.
You must trust human.
Trust & love is the lifeline,
not money.
If what you say is true,
you mustn't ever
take a loan from me.
If you do take a loan,
then you should accept
money's power.
Why are you talking like that?
At times of need,
one must take loans.
Just now you said,
love rules our life.
Ask loan from it?
Okay, I trust love
more than money.
I'll never come to
you for a loan.
Let me see it.
What have you done now?
At first opportunity,
you'll take other's responsibility.
If Sankaraiah fails
to repay the loan,
Kotaiah will throw you
to the streets.
Yes, he'll do it.
First think about your slippers,
before spreading
a carpet to the world.
I didn't spread any
carpet to the world.
I just removed a thorn
my neighbour ran into.
That's all!
You'll never change.
Got your EAMCET results?
- Yes uncle.
What rank did you get?
He got 30 and I got 40.
You've got very good ranks.
Yes, indeed great ranks...
I got in 30000's and
he got in 40000's.
If you get such great ranks,
how can you get an engineering seat?
Why not, if you pay donation?
How can I pay lakhs of donation?
Is it possible for me?
I don't know what you'll do,
I'm doing Engineering
in Bangalore, that's final.
This is the problem with you,
you're very stubborn.
Okay... let me see.
Who is getting a seat
without paying donation?
Pavan, put your legs down.
You'll not get a seat here,
ask your father,
let's go to Bangalore and
do engineering there. - Okay.
No way.
I'll not agree to pay for
your engineering seat.
You know, Pavan's father is
paying donation for his seat.
Why not you?
I don't want my son to buy
engineering degree. I'll not pay.
Why're you so stubborn?
What's wrong in asking you?
How can you study now
without paying donations?
Buying education will not work,
work hard to educate yourself.
I can spend anything
for studying not to buy.
I'm not able to understand
anything you say.
What's there in it
not to understand?
You got a rank in 30000's,
that means you're not qualified
to become an engineer.
If you really want
to become an engineer,
study hard and write
the entrance exam again.
I can spend anything for studies.
- What's your idea dad?
There are lakhs of people like
me with ranks above 30000's,
they are paying money to
become engineers. Why shouldn't I?
You're right.
Unqualified people are paying...
to become doctors,
engineers and lawyers.
They are doctors for namesake only.
They can't treat anyone.
Namesake engineers,
buildings crumble like pack of cards.
Namesake lawyers,
justice is miscarried.
They become a burden to the nation,
they are not worth a dime.
I don't want you also to become
one of those namesake engineers.
Sir Arthur Cotton...
Mokshagundam Viswesraiah...
Our President Abdul Kalam...
they are true engineers.
Do you expect every engineer
to become an Abdul Kalam?
No need... but you must have
a passion to become one.
Father, I'm not a genius
like Abdul Kalam,
I'm an average student.
Even Abdul Kalam was
an average student,
but the desire of engineer
made him a bright student.
Develop interest in studies.
Got it son?
Never again talk about
donation with me.
Yuck! Unnecessarily I was
born in this house.
If I had been born in
Subrahmanyam's house,
I would've become
an engineer.
You've passed in all the tests,
There's one more final test...
you've to pass that also.
Tell me sir,
what is the test?
There's one Mr. Ramanarayana
waiting outside, go & meet him.
He'll give you the details.
Got it? What's the final test?
Bring Rs. 3 lakhs
and take SI's job.
Sir, I passed all the tests,
I got selected in
personal interview also.
Why should I pay money?
Asking me why? What do you think
is the power of an SI's post?
It's a golden egg laying goose,
if you want it, pay now...
Paid sir.
Rs. 3 lakhs sir... count it.
- No need,
paying bribe and a prostitute
will always be correct.
You've got the job!
Look, he has got the job
without passing any tests.
Don't think too much! There're just
two posts available, bye.
Why are you still pondering?
Once you become SI, just 3 months
is enough to earn Rs. 3 lakhs.
You take care of Punjagutta circle,
I'll take care of Ameerpet circle.
That's it!
Go and ask money
from your father.
I'll not give.
I know this will be your answer.
But you've to.
Though I had passed all the tests,
I'm forced to pay up.
Suri got the job without any
tests and by paying bribe.
If I've to become an SI,
you've to cough up Rs. 3 lakhs.
Look, you'll pay Rs. 3 lakhs
and buy the SI job,
you'll take bribes to get
back your money.
When I gave bribe, you'll justify,
why not I take bribes,
and become a corrupt officer.
I don't want to send a corrupt
officer from my house.
Father, that's where
our opinions clash.
I passed all the tests honestly.
What can I do if
they are not honest?
Can I bring a change in them?
I didn't tell you to bring
a change in them. You be honest.
I don't care all that.
I don't know how you do it.
I want that SI's job!
Okay, let's forget about it
and find a new job.
Let's file a case against the
officer who wanted bribe.
What are you saying father?
Do you want to file a case
and go around courts?
If we pay the money
spent on it as bribe,
I'll get the job, you know?
How can you say we'll not
get justice before hand?
Look, I don't trust cases & courts.
I trust only bribe.
Tell me, will you pay
Rs. 3 lakhs or not? - I'll not.
Now I've understood you,
you said he's unqualified
to become an engineer,
I'm losing the SI's job,
though I'm qualified.
Are you covering your
incompetency as morals?
Yuck! Even miser Kotaiah
is better than you.
Take your fare.
Did you've a comfortable journey?
- Yes father.
Come in.
You look tired,
go in and take rest.
Have this sweet.
My husband is a software
professional, isn't he?
He's planning to go to America.
He met consultant
also on the way back.
They have asked him to
come again for formalities.
Happy to hear it. Go.
No daddy, they are asking Rs. 4 lakhs
to send him to America.
It'll be nice if you
arrange funds for him...
Why? Did they ask as deposit?
No, we have to find a job
within six months.
How will you survive
those 6 months?
We'll work in hotels
or petrol bunks.
Can't you do the same job here?
And try to get a job
in Infosys or Wipro.
Do you want me to work
as petrol delivery boy?
What's wrong in it?
When you're not ashamed to do
in America, why feel here?
In India we get paltry rupees,
but in America we get dollars.
You need those paltry rupees
to go to America.
If you don't find a job
within 6 months,
they will confiscate your Visa
and deport you to India.
Again you'll need the same
paltry rupees to survive.
Father-in-law!
Oh! Has sweet turned spicy so soon.
I didn't hurt you.
I'm telling you a truth.
If you're worth,
nothing can stop you.
If you're unworthy,
you're a waste anywhere.
Daddy, we don't want your advises
and moral instructions,
give us money,
that's enough!
I'll not give.
Don't give...
don't give anything...
You don't want Chinna
to become an engineer,
you don't want elder son
to become SI,
you don't want son-in-law and
daughter to go to America.
I'm seeing first time a father who doesn't
care about his children's future.
Why don't you try
to understand me?
What's there to understand?
You claim to have loved
home and society alike.
Why don't you follow the
society's path that you love?
Your friend Subrahmanyam paid donation
for the engineering seat to his son.
Kotaiah bought SI's job.
Your Chairman has sent his son to
America for higher studies.
They are the people you love,
aren't they?
They are much forward than you.
If you go backward
with your ideals,
they will not award you
with an Idealist title.
They will make fun of you
as useless man.
Fearing their fun,
do you want me to change my path?
I'll try to bring them back to my path,
I'll never go wayward.
Stop it!
They said win at home
and then world.
I'm seeing for the first time a
head of family so unconcerned.
Sir, you must save my son.
- What happened?
He's fighting death after
an accident. - Oh My god!
He's in hospital, he has hurt
his head severely.
They suggested an
emergency operation.
It'll cost Rs. 1 lakh.
I can't muster that much
fund immediately.
Chairman is also not in town.
You must save my son
at any cost sir.
You don't worry!
I'll come immediately. - Okay sir...
For you only!
When people say father-in-law is
greatman, I took it lightly.
Instead of giving it
to his children,
I just came to know he's a beggar
who gives alms to beggars.
Didn't you find anyone else to seek
money other than my father?
You keep quiet, mother.
Hey Oldman! Why are you
still standing here?
Clear away from here,
before my father comes back.
Or else I'll throw you out!
- What's that?
Mother, I'm warning you,
if you don't stop father now,
I'll leave this home.
Why are you still here?
Go... get out!
Go!
Here... here...
I want Rs. 1 lakh immediately.
This is Vanasthalipuram
plot documents.
I'll give but you've to
accept your defeat.
Give me Rs. 1 lakh now,
I'll accept defeat.
How can I give without any pledge?
I'll give... sit there.
Be quick! I must go urgently.
- Sit, I'll get money.
You've come urgently for
Rs. 1 lakh, it means,
someone would've come
seeking help from you.
You would've promised him.
By the way, who is that beggar?
- That's none of your business.
Indeed it is unnecessary to me,
helping every Tom, Dick and Harry,
I'm sure you'll come to the streets.
Stop Raghuramaiah!
Look at this.
Despite my warnings,
when she claimed her daughter
is suffering from cancer,
you donated money generously
like a great philanthropist.
Have you read now?
It has been proved that
she was cheat.
That's why I love money and
respect it than humans.
But I'm extremely happy Kotaiah!
Happy? Why?
It's proved that the little girl
is not affected with cancer.
That's enough for me.
You helped in time, thanks.
Brother, water.
- I've to go out urgently.
Even god can't save you with
so many bad habits.
He doesn't have any bad habits.
Pity, Mercy, Compassion!
What other bad habits one needs
to ruin his own life!
Where is Mallaiah?
I don't know.
Who knows?
Stop!
You're giving money
to some stranger.
I won't stop you.
But, settle the money
to my children too.
Promise me that you'll make
their desires come true.
Promise me if you want
our relationship to continue.
The world is no different
to home to this man.
These 4 people haven't understood
his objective for now.
Without money,
I can't do it.
As a doctor,
how could you say that.
How many times
do I've to tell you?
Here is the money.
Perform the operation.
Bought the money!
Pay it in the counter.
I'll get ready the
operation theatre. - Okay.
Look... - Mad man.
You're a God.
Pay the money in the counter and
find out what has to be done.
Go. - Okay sir.
The arrangements are good.
I've arranged this bride seeing
scheme in a very simple manner.
Scheme!
Why is he calling it a scheme?
There is no cheating
in this, right?
Don't mistake him.
Explain him.
Sir, I worked in State Govt. For 40 years
and retired very recently.
I had implemented
many govt. Schemes.
Since I was used to it,
I said scheme by mistake.
Thank God!
You didn't made us wash dishes
saying it's 'Self help scheme'.
The way you talk is
very interesting.
Son-in-law, what would you
like to have?
Coffee... Tea...?
Don't call him as
Son-in-law so soon?
Father... - What's it?
Call your daughter.
He'll see what he wants and
I'll see what I want.
Sir, what he means is,
his son will see her beauty and
he'll see to the other matters.
To hell with your
other matters.
Were you also working in
State govt. Along with him?
Can't you clearly say dowry?
Is your daughter fair or
dark complexioned?
She'll be like me.
- Is she bald?
No, very fair.
We aren't concerned about
your daughter's complexion.
We're concerned about dowry.
White or Black?
Greetings.
Sit down. - Please sit down.
I like the girl. - Me too.
Me too, father.
- You also say.
I like the girl too.
- I 'll slipper you.
Hold a mike & say you like her.
Let everyone in the city know it.
Useless fellow!
If they know you like her,
your dowry rate will fall down.
To get this minus married,
I've to earn from plus like you.
Yuck!
Change your position.
You listened to him, didn't you?
He likes her. Take her in.
- Please go inside.
Look at her height.
- Perfect choice.
Priest, why are you
sitting silently?
The other matters...
Actually... - I'll give you
Rs. 4 lakhs as dowry.
How much?
- 4 lakhs.
Lakhs! He's saying as if
it is 4 crores.
I paid Rs. 4 lakhs bribe
for his SI's job.
Father, I said I like the girl.
Why talk about dowry now?
Why? For this.
What is this?
From feeding bottle to the
Police uniform you wore,
I've noted down all
the expenses in this.
This is only the principle.
I've must get it with interest.
Maintaining an account of
your son's expenses!
People will beat with slippers
if I maintain an account of other's sons.
You're getting respected because
you're my son and a police officer.
Think about your position
if you don't have these.
What will be my position?
- Position?
O bald head, he is not my son.
Father!
- I said you're not my son.
He's my son,
a police officer.
What will this son-in-law have?
- He'll drink pesticide.
Father! - Didn't I say
you're not my son.
Stop it.
Ask your daughter to bring milk.
I said just like that, but you're
dreaming about your first night!
Father, what's all this?
Sir, tell me,
who is my son-in-law?
Tell me the dowry you will pay.
I'll tell you, who your son-in-law is?
For the time being,
adjust with Rs. 4 lakhs.
After marriage,
there are other schemes too.
We're not interested
about those schemes.
My son's price is Rs. 10 lakhs.
If you agree, inform us.
Or else, I consider
this scheme, a failure.
Get up.
- You too.
Water sir.
How is your son?
Because of you, he survived
from the clutches of death.
I'll repay your money very soon.
- That's okay.
To repay my money,
don't take loan from others.
As you say sir.
Who're you?
What do you want?
My name is Giri.
I've come to meet Mr. Raghuram.
Where are you coming from?
- From Mental hospital.
A mental named Giri, whose mental
disorder is cured has come to see you sir.
Don't call a cured man
as mental.
Sorry sir.
- That's alright. Call him.
Giri...
- Greetings sir. I'm Giri sir.
Giri, are you fine?
- I'm very fine.
My mental disorder is fully cured.
Even the doctor has certified it.
I'm very happy to hear that.
Mallaiah, I'm appointing Giri
as House keeping officer.
As what?
As the sweeper.
- I see.
Tell him about his job.
- Okay sir.
Thank you sir.
Indra, did you pack your
father's lunch box? - No.
No?
What has happened?
Why should I be concerned
about a person?
Who is not concerned about us?
Shut up.
It is my mistake for asking
you to pack his lunch box.
Hubby, I've kept dhal
in the top box.
Don't leave anything.
There is tomato soup
in the second.
Since you love it,
I've packed plenty.
You don't eat curd rice,
if curd is packed separately.
So, I've mixed curd & rice.
Don't forget to have lunch
in your busy schedule.
You'll atleast think about us
when you see the lunch box.
I was born in this
house for nothing.
If I had been born in Subrahmanyam's
house, I would've become an Engineer.
The miser Kotaiah
is better than you.
We need money not your advices
and moral instructions.
Win at home and then world.
First time I'm seeing a head of
family so unconcerned.
In this competitive world, every need
must be fulfilled. Nothing is wrong.
If the bus we travel
meets with an accident,
we break the emergency door
and come out. Is it wrong?
People like us are in
danger every second.
In my point of view,
doing wrong...
is like breaking the emergency door.
Enough.
Stop it.
I didn't mean you.
You carry on.
I may forgive my children
if they are useless.
But I won't allow them
to lead a corrupt life.
On whose name this house is registered?
- On the owner's name.
Owner means your father, right?
A own house for us!
This is a rented house.
No way.
We must do something.
You need money to do anything.
- You're right.
Whatever we may do,
it's only for money. - Yes.
I want to become an SI,
he wants to become
an engineer,
you both want to
go to America.
All this is to make money.
To make money,
we need to invest money.
Who'll provide that?
- Who else other than your father.
Didn't you see the confusion
in our house the other day?
My father doesn't
have that much money.
I know that.
He has earned a good name
in the society.
That's enough for us
to make money.
I didn't get you.
I've understood.
What is the business,
we're planning to start?
Let's open a Chit Fund Company
on your father's name.
We'll be the directors.
If people know Raghuram's sons,
son-in-law have started a finance co.,
then all the people in this colony
will deposit money in our company.
Our needs will get fulfilled.
The plan is very good.
What if you go away to America
after opening the company...?
What's that silly doubt?
When I've so much money,
will I go to America?
We have no business experience.
If something goes wrong...?
- What if something goes wrong...!
As long as we've money,
we can solve any problem.
If it is out of control,
it is the people who are going
to suffer & not us.
This is cheating.
What cheating?
Swindling money from students like you
as donation. Isn't it a cheating?
Though he is qualified
for a SI's post,
they said he'll get the job, only if he
pays Rs. 3 lakhs. Isn't it a cheating?
There is nothing wrong in cheating
the society which has cheated us,
I'm ready.
When shall we start the company?
Yuck! I never thought that you
would marry such a cheap guy.
You people don't know
to lead a honest life.
So, you've planned
to cheat people.
We don't have a job like you
to be honest.
Bharathi, didn't you hear what he said?
At least you advice him.
What am I to advice him?
If a father like you doesn't
care about his children,
they will turn into
thieves & cheats.
For giving birth to us,
give us Rs. 5 lakhs each.
We won't cheat anyone.
We'll listen to you.
What? Trying to blackmail me.
I'm not blackmailing you.
If you don't want us
to use your name,
give us 5 lakhs each.
We'll live on our own efforts.
Shekar, what are you talking?
Father-in-law doesn't have that
much money to give us.
We know that he doesn't
have the money.
But he has friends
all over the city.
He has to just ask them.
Money will come to his door step.
We would be very happy if you
arrange the money in 2 days.
Volga
Has your hopes dashed?
Has the noose tightened?
Has you ideal got wet in turmoil?
If I don't give them money,
my children will take to wrong path.
They won't even hesitate
to cheat people.
If it shouldn't happen,
I must give them the money
they had asked for.
But who will give me
so much money right now?
Welcome...
Mine is a compound
interest business.
For those who are in need of money,
I will be better
than an ATM center.
Because ATM has limits.
I don't have any.
No matter how many lakhs
you may ask for.
Spot decision & spot payments.
But you must have
something to pledge.
How food is necessary to live,
you must have something
to pledge to get a loan.
Hey Raghuram, want any loan?
What do you have to pledge?
Utensils to Charminar,
I'm ready to take anything.
What? You don't have
anything to pledge.
Sorry. I don't give money
without pledging anything
Want 15 lakhs...?
Come, I'll give you.
Here is the money.
Why are you staring at me?
It is you who told me that
money is only paper.
Take it.
Give 5 lakhs to Mr. Raghuram.
Tomorrow is the salary day.
No problem,
make the necessary arrangements.
Okay sir.
In which account
should I debit this?
In my personal account.
Brother...
Welcome.
Mastan, Zaheer has come.
I'm Raghuram & not Zaheer.
- I know.
Zaheer is my elder son's name.
But he is no more.
You saved our family.
So, I called you Zaheer.
Welcome Raghuram.
Infact, I wanted to meet you.
But you've come.
Please come.
Rashmi & Badshah, please go out.
Greetings brother.
- Greetings. Greetings brother.
You too Mumtaz.
- Okay.
Please take it. Rs. 5 lakhs.
Mastan bhai, why're you giving
me money so secretly?
I don't like anyone
to know about this.
If people know that
you owe me money,
your honour will be at stake.
Even if I die, my people shouldn't
trouble you asking for money.
Volga
Have you gone mad?
You joined engineering
because you liked it.
Have you got bored
with it so soon?
Just because you paid donation,
it doesn't mean that I shouldn't
get bored of that subject.
I've started to hate mathematics.
I won't do engineering.
I'll join some college and
will do some degree course.
Hey...
I paid 4 lakhs as donation,
not just 1 or 2 lakhs.
I borrowed that money.
You're worried about the money
you paid & not my interests.
Yes, I'm money minded now.
I'm least bothered
about your interests.
If you don't complete
your engineering degree,
I'll break your legs.
I would rather walk out
of this house,
but I won't do engineering.
Threatening me...?
Go... go man.
Why are you still
standing here? Go.
You brought him up luxuries and
he doesn't know the value of money.
No point in blaming him now.
You shut up.
Don't even give him a glass of water.
Get me & Raghuram some coffee.
I didn't pay the donation
to avoid such situations.
Are you justifying yourself
using the situation?
If he had told me this after 4 years
I would've really got hurt.
Thank god he told me that now.
My problem will get reduced.
And talking about money,
we always have money problem.
Come & sit.
You phoned that you wanted
a favor from me.
Oh No! Nothing.
I'll discuss about that later.
What's there to talk later?
Hey, don't think that
I'm advising you again.
Stop sticking to your
old principles.
Fulfill your children's aspirations.
I've lost.
You've won Kotaiah.
What did you say?
- I said you've won.
Only now I understood that life
runs on money & not on love.
That was very sweet to hear.
Have you understood, even the Great
Raghuram has bowed before money?
Let me tell you a fact.
Eagle is the transport
to Lord Vishnu.
Nandhi is the transport
to Lord Shiva.
Human is the transport to the
money which rules this world,
Okay, that's fine.
You've accepted your defeat.
Do you want money?
- Yes.
How much?
- 5 lakhs.
5 lakhs...?
- Can't you give me?
Why not?
But you need to pledge something
for that much money...
I don't have anything.
Without pledging anything...
Tell me if you won't.
- Why won't I give you?
That's my business.
But my business rule says
that I must...
I will give you money
by breaking the rule.
Do you know why?
Because you're an incompetent
who can't cheat,
a mad man who believes in good.
That's the reason, I'll give you.
Please wait. I'll bring it.
Volga
It's very late.
Why haven't you gone to bed yet?
I didn't get sleep.
So I didn't go to bed.
Please reduce the TV volume.
I'm Raghuram speaking.
Who're you?
Please reduce the TV volume.
Reduce the volume, idiots.
Do you have to shout to say that?
Can't you say that politely?
Volga
Thanks for understanding
our problems at least now.
Father-in-law,
I know your capacity.
I also know that you won't
hurt your children.
When asked to a Rupee,
"What will you do?",
It said that,
I'll make Harischandra to tell a lie,
make a husband & wife quarrel,
separate a father from his son,
spark sibling rivalry,
and finally, it said that it
will separate close friends also.
I thought my home was
an excuse to such a Rupee.
But I never expected that rupee
will enter my home,
and destroy bonds & relationship.
I wanted to correct you people.
But you people think that
money will correct everything,
money will make everything
look good,
and said that you'll be fine,
only if you've money.
I didn't want you to spoil your life
by taking wrong decisions.
So, I gave you this money.
As children of Raghuram,
I didn't want you to commit any wrong.
So, I gave you this money.
Are you happy now?
You may not be feeling hungry
on seeing them happy.
But I'm hungry.
Oh No! Wait for some more time.
I'll cook in no time.
Hubby, Upma is ready.
Did you eat? - No.
I'll eat after you finish eating.
No way. Sit.
Volga
Oh No! It's 1 'O'clock.
It's another day.
We can eat only after taking bath
and offering prayers to god.
Moreover, today is
an auspicious Friday.
There's nothing.
It will be dawn in 2 hours.
We'll eat then.
Sorry my dear.
Volga
If you arrange for
money in 2 days,
we would be very happy.
That miser Kotaiah is
better than you.
You must accept your defeat.
If people know that you owe me money,
your honour will be at stake.
If you don't fulfill your
children's little wishes,
how can they love you?
My son is saved because of you.
First see whether you've slippers,
before spreading carpet
to the world.
You saved our family.
That's why, I called you Zaheer.
Give us Rs. 5 lakhs each for
having given birth to us.
Adopt 10 mentally ill children.
Go man... go.
Who was your teacher?
Sorry Raghu, I was wrong.
You sold appadalu
on the streets.
What's this father?
It would be a disgrace
if anyone sees me.
You saved our home.
To love or to be loved,
money has nothing to do with it.
My opinion was buried
in my house itself.
Your story was wonderful!
After listening to everything,
I've come to a conclusion that,
you died cheating others.
It's true.
If you are such a honest man,
why should we come to take you?
Yes, I'm not a honest man.
I was bent by my children's love.
I borrowed money from
those who trusted me,
and gave it to my children.
Where are his sons & son-in-law?
They are not to be seen.
Son-in-law has gone to Mumbai.
Sons are in Bangalore.
Oh No! His sons were not with him
in his last minutes.
Have you informed them?
I must know about their
whereabouts to inform them.
I've informed my friends
in Bangalore & Mumbai.
Go & stay with Bharathi.
- Okay.
Where are they?
They were at home when I died.
How can they go to
Bangalore or Mumbai?
You don't know,
what had happened?
What happened?
Oh My god! He's killing us.
After you died & before
we came to take you,
something had happened.
Father-in-law...
Volga
Father...
Father...
Don't cry.
If you cry, your mother will wake.
Mother mustn't know this.
- Indra stop!
No. Don't wake up your mother.
Brother...!
If she gets up,
she'll start crying.
And the people around
will come here.
The people will know about
this in a second,
and spread like forest fire,
everyone will be here before dawn.
What will happen if they come here?
Those who gave money to
our father will also come.
If they demand money and
stop us from taking the body,
what will be our position?
What shall we do now Shekar?
Until his last rites are over,
we must be in hiding.
Indra, stay here & manage.
What am I to tell them
if they enquire about you?
Tell them that we've
gone to Bangalore.
We'll be in touch
with you on phone.
What about our father?
His funeral...?
He lived for the welfare of
other people until his last breath.
They will lit the pyre.
It's better we put
the body on the bed.
Volga
That's the present situation.
After you died, your sons & son-in-law
started abusing you & went away.
I've never seen such idiots before.
I never thought they would abscond
leaving their father's body behind.
Yuck!
Why are you accusing them?
They haven't done anything wrong.
Though the penance is broken,
you must get it's fruit.
He borrowed money for them & died.
If the borrowers take back
the money from them,
there is no point in he giving
them the money or to his death.
I'll kill you,
if you talk anymore.
Sir, why are you fighting
because of my sons?
Stop fighting and
tell me, where are they?
Want to see them?
- Yes.
Let's go & see.
Oh No!
Your BP is very high.
What should I do
to control my BP?
It's very simple.
Don't lend money to others.
You said a very nice thing.
I thought you asked for some money.
I won't give you.
So, I'm the first victim.
I was joking.
I can't live without lending money.
But if you don't get
back the money...?
Life's gone!
- Worst will be over.
It's the life of the one
who borrowed money & not mine.
Sir... - What is it?
- Raghuram has died.
What have you done, Mr. Raghuram?
I had given money to someone.
Once I get it, we'll fix
the marriage. - Okay.
Your marriage has been fixed, my dear.
Mastan Bhai, Raghuram has died.
Excuse me.
I know that you gave
money to Raghuram.
His sons would be there.
Ask them.
Please ask them.
If you don't, your sister's
marriage will be at stake.
Are they staying in this lodge?
Take a good look at them.
Shekar, why are you so tensed?
Tension...!
Why should we hide in
a lodge like criminals?
Yes, we are criminals.
For us to lead a
luxurious life tomorrow,
we must be criminals today.
There's no other choice.
Yes, your son-in-law is
very honest man.
He's speaking the truth.
An important news!
The famous editor Mr. Alamarthi Raghuram
died today morning.
Brother, look at the TV.
"He had offered a great service
to the print media
and worked for people's upliftment".
Newspaper Owner G. Venkat Rao
paid rich homage to Mr. Raghuramaiah.
But on this sad occassion his
sons are not in station,
On seeing this message, he hoped that
his sons & son-in-law will come home.
Did you see?
The Chairman is so much
worried about us.
Yes. He respects
my father very much.
Let's make money
out of his respect.
Didn't you get me?
We're opening a Chit Fund company
in your father's name.
Not only that, pay the bribe
and confirm your SI job.
But we promised our father...
Our father is no more to question
about the promises we made.
Why fear unnecessarily?
How dare you cheat me?
I won't spare you.
I will kill you.
Will you kill him?
Allow me to enter my body once.
I'll teach them a lesson.
I'll repay my loans.
His inner voice has started troubling him.
We are in for trouble.
Once dead will never come back alive.
Please don't trouble us.
No sir.
I'll go urgently and
inform my Chairman,
or Mastan Bhai,
or Kotaiah,
that these people are hiding
in a lodge here only.
Hey! Stop!
Yes sir... he's gone sir.
I don't know sir.
Yes sir.
I don't know sir.
Why are you getting irritated?
We are getting many calls
asking about Raghuram,
they are asking his address
and other details.
So much of response for the
death of an ordinary editor.
Mallaiah... Chairman...
- Chairman is out of station.
He's in Delhi.
No staff has come
to office yet.
They have gone pay last respects
to departed soul Raghuram.
You'd helped this man, hadn't you?
- To him only.
Anyway you are dead now, he's happy
because he needn't repay you.
Volga
Take water sir.
You take water every hour.
Have it.
What's this?
Are we visible to him?
No... no.
I couldn't come to pay my last
respects though you'd helped me.
Please forgive sir.
Helping others with money and
leaving near ones as orphans,
fearing your family members will
abuse you even after death,
I didn't go there.
But I'll definitely
repay your loan.
I'll repay it to your heirs...
You're still alive to repay,
he has died before giving,
that's the difference.
What's this?
You wanted to see your funeral,
but sitting comfortably here.
Get up... get up... come.
What have you done Raghuramaiah?
I never expected you'll
cheat me like this.
Sir, I forgot to bring
flower garlands.
Flower garlands?
Waste of money.
Let's atleast burn incense sticks
at his feet and bow to him.
Bloody bull!
We are not here to pay homage.
We are here to get back my loan.
Where are his sons and son-in-law?
Go and find them.
Volga
Trusting you, I lent you money
without any pledge,
will you cheat me like this?
Kotaiah, please forgive me.
My sons are rascals.
My son-in-law is a wastrel.
I took loan from you
to settle their lives.
They are in a lodge
with the money.
You go there immediately
and take back your money.
Go... go... Kotaiah... go.
Why?
How many times do I've tell
they can't hear you?
Why haven't they come yet?
I told you to find them,
why are you still here?
I can find them if they are here,
how can I if they are in Bangalore?
Bangalore?
It seems sons and son-in-law have
fled to Bangalore overnight?
What man?
Your money has gone
down the drain.
The world at large abuses
Kotaiah as bad man & miser.
But such a man had trust in me.
Kotaiah who never trusts
his own shadow also,
trusted and lent me money.
I've cheated such a man.
Cheated him badly.
Volga
This is very sad news...
a news we all must know
and pay homage...
We know Alamarthi Raghuramaiah
as an editor only.
We've been flooded with phone
calls knowing about his demise.
But inquiries about him,
reveals he's a great humanist
and a great social worker.
Let's know about this great soul
and pay our homage to him.
Great Humanist and social worker!
How can people know
how he had cheated me?
What? Did he cheat you?
Cheated... cheated profoundly...
Look, when so many people
are worried about him,
without telling a word
to any living soul,
isn't it cheating to go
away on his own?
What do you say?
Actually... - What actually?
I can't tell you anything more
about him. Please leave me.
Mr. Raghuram, don't think
you've escaped with death.
I would rather kill the others
and will get back my money.
Let your sons come.
I'm waiting for them.
Hey you mad fellow!
Even if they come here, you won't
be able to get back your money.
His sons are worse than you.
Mind your words.
Who're you to abuse my sons?
Wow! You're getting angry!
You were scolding your sons a while ago
and now you're supporting them.
You died for your children
to be happy.
Don't kill me with your words.
Our job is to torture you.
How can we step away
from our duty?
We know Mr. Alamarthi Raghuram
as a newspaper editor.
He's such a great humanist.
He donates half of his earnings to
society and the rest to his family.
He gave solutions to people
through his letters.
Even our Chief minister has
condoled his death.
Let's meet a few people,
who'll tell about his greatness.
Forgive us for troubling
you at this hour.
Mr. Raghuram has donated his eyes
to our organization after his death.
If you please co-operate
with us...
Volga
If you please go out...
Of all the organs eyes are very
important so said our elders.
By donating your eyes,
your good deeds have doubled.
This is a sin,
not a good deed.
Why did you say that?
How can you say
donating eyes is a sin?
He wants his eyes to live in
this world even after his death.
That's greed.
Isn't greed a sin?
To hell with your ideals!
Donating eyes & giving vision to others
after one's death is a noble.
Get me that dust bin.
This isn't a natural death.
His eyes are of no use.
It looks like a suicide note.
Greetings to everyone.
This letter is written
by a man of failures.
As a husband to a wife,
I couldn't make her understand me.
As a father, I couldn't
make my children understand life.
Fearing that my children
will cheat the public,
I borrowed money from those
who had trust in me.
Knowing that I won't be
able to repay the money,
and with no other choice left,
I'm running away from
this world as a cheat.
As a citizen, I lost the right
to live on this earth,
and I'm dying as
a man of failure.
Yours, don't know
what I'm to whom, a loser.
Why am I writing this letter?
Though the doctors praised
your noble deed,
they have brought the secret
about your death to light.
So, you committed suicide!
Suicide is a very big sin!
You'll definitely go to hell.
He always used to help others
and never asked help from others.
Poor man! I wonder what made
him to commit suicide.
Suicide!
Hubby...
Volga
What happened? - Nothing.
It's been very long
since he died.
His Eyes have become useless.
That's why we are worried.
Please go out.
By telling everyone that he
has committed suicide,
I don't want to defame him.
Oh no! You need not tell me that.
Let's go.
- Okay sir.
What have you done?
See for yourselves!
Look how much they love me.
You ridiculed me saying that
my wife was eating Upma.
That was the last dish I touched.
Volga
She ate because she
remembered this incident.
She ate not because she was hungry
or not that she doesn't love me.
Kotaiah... What Kotaiah!
I'm only guarding the body.
We waited till now for
his sons return.
But they haven't come yet.
Don't know what to do?
If you don't know what to do,
Give company to the body
We've to wait till his sons return.
They won't come.
How come you're so sure?
We don't know where they are?
They don't know about
their father's death.
How will they come?
Without his sons!
What a pity!
Never mind if his sons
are not here.
We are also like his sons.
We'll do the last rites.
Your Rs. 5 lakhs are gone.
Who knows?
The horse can lie
or can get up?
His sons might come and
I might get back my money.
Let's see.
Mastan Bhai, you didn't want others to
know I had borrowed money from you.
How am I going to repay you?
I dragged you into trouble.
I cheated you.
I feel ashamed to
seek your forgiveness.
I'm ashamed of myself.
You're making me a debtor.
We come to this earth alone...
We go from this earth alone...
Our fate makes us enact
a play in between...
The bonds & relationships never
come with us till the end...
Death is inevitable...
Fame will stay on forever...
Your body & your honour
are being borne...
...by those 4 people.
...by those 4 people.
I'm no way related to him.
He took me to Jaipur and
gave me a new wooden leg.
He's really a god.
Forgive me daddy.
I want see him.
- Stop.
Sit down. Where will you go?
Sit down.
- No, I must go.
I told you to sit.
- We'll get caught if we go out.
Money lenders won't
be kind to us.
I don't want this money.
I want to see daddy.
Shut up. Where will you go?
It's dangerous if he
stays here anymore.
We must change our hideout.
Call the travels.
I'll handle him.
I say sit.
Don't talk. Shut up.
How long will it take
to reach Vijayawada?
If we don't stop in between,
we can reach there in 7 hours.
Okay, go fast.
Hubby, something really
bad has happened.
Father didn't die naturally.
He had committed suicide.
Come home immediately.
Though you knew where they were,
you were lying.
Yuck!
By supporting sinners like you,
I lost my loving husband.
Please forgive me...
I really made you cry, didn't I?
But I'm sorry.
From tomorrow, I'll make your cry.
Impossible.
When you said that you'll make me
cry from tomorrow,
I thought you were joking.
But I never thought that
you'll kill yourself.
It's my mistake.
You must forgive me.
In trying to convince
me and children,
I couldn't understand how badly
you were hurt between us.
Even at the times of hardship,
I was so selfish that I didn't know
that you'll be left alone.
Please forgive me...
So many people in a
funeral procession. Who has died?
Social activist Mr. Raghuram.
Mr. Raghuram!
Sir, I'll carry his body
and will be back soon.
What are you doing?
If you go, how will you
take us to Vijayawada.
I know him very well.
I must lucky to carry his body.
Wait in the car or
else take another car.
From where did you get him?
Chinna, listen to me.
- Chinna stop.
So now you remember me.
Stop. You shouldn't touch me.
There they are, Raghuram's sons.
You've come at the right time.
Get down fast.
Come...
When 4 people praised you...
when 4 people abused you...
you carried your principles
like a cross...
You wanted the well being
of people in society...
you showed them the
path of righteousness...
The 4 has turned into 10...
The 10 has turned
into 100s & 1000s...
They are following you
as your disciples...
...those 4 people...
We thought he died
like an orphan.
But so many people have come
to his funeral procession.
Why will they not come?
His death news was
telecast on TV.
Subrahmanyam, I don't like him
to perform my last rites.
Stop him... please stop him.
Did you see?
Even now, he is worried about
money & not about me.
I don't like him to
lit pyre to my body.
Subrahmanyam, stop him.
He is an idiot.
Stop it.
I don't like you to
perform my last rites.
Mastan Bhai, Kotaiah...
at least you stop him.
Your money is in that bag.
Go and take it.
But stop him.
How many times to tell him
that they will not hear him?
Until his head breaks into pieces,
we have to face this.
Lit pyre & save him
from going to hell.
Hey, you don't have to save me
from going to the hell.
Return their money,
it's enough.
Betrayal is the biggest sin.
By committing that sin,
I'm in hell already.
Return their money.
You don't have to free me from hell.
Stop!
By litting pyre,
do you think you can escape?
Your father borrowed
Rs. 5 lakhs from me.
He borrowed the money
yesterday & died.
Who'll repay the money?
The son who lit's the pyre.
Bingo! You've caught him
by his neck.
Don't leave him until he
returns the money. Go ahead.
You're looking around
as if you are deaf.
He who studies people,
will become a philosopher
or a business man,
I'm a business man.
But do you know what kind
of a business man I'm.
I'm a ruthless business man
even to a widow.
Money is important to me.
Give me my money and
lit pyre to your father's body.
Kotaiah, do you know
what you're doing?
What should I know?
I'm not picking anyone's pocket.
I'm getting back my money.
It's between me & the dead body.
Who are you to interfere?
Move away.
Give me money & lit pyre
to your father's body.
Why are you looking there?
I'm here.
Repay the money.
Why should I repay the
loan he had taken?
You won't give money
without pledging anything.
You keep what my father
had pledged with you.
Now he has come
to the point.
I'm waiting to take
what he had pledged.
Go ahead. Keep it with you.
- Then why to wait?
Cut your father's head
and give me.
Kotaiah, what are you talking?
- I didn't say this.
I want him to cut his head
and give me.
Because he promised me that he'll
repay the loan pledging his head.
Pledging his head means
pledging his honour.
Infact it's not his head.
I didn't know that.
He also did the same.
He pledged his honour in my hands.
Why should I talk to you all?
Listen everyone,
If he wants his head,
my money must be returned.
Kotaiah, please move away.
Settle the accounts later.
There will be nothing left later.
His ash will be left
to apply on our faces.
Repay my money or
burn me along with him.
He won't listen to us,
he is a flesh eating vulture.
Why still talk to him?
Throw him out.
Stop.
If you step forward,
I'll burn myself.
I really don't care
about my life.
As long as the man lives,
money gives power to life.
It's money which made
a man to cheat.
That's why I like money
...very much.
Kotaiah, it's enough.
Tell me where to sign the papers.
I'll sign & repay your money.
Give that to me.
What will you repay?
For the money you took 3 years back,
you haven't repaid a penny.
Will you repay 5 lakhs?
Get lost.
Shekar, don't delay.
Give me my money.
Lit pyre to your father's body.
I won't give.
Because my principles are
very similar to yours.
I give importance to money
than anyone's life.
If I don't light pyre,
or if you burn yourself,
nothing bothers me.
Do as you like.
Brother...
It's wrong my boy. Don't leave your
father's body this way.
Wait. I'll talk to him.
Kotaiah, take my gold bangles.
I'll repay the loan amount.
You only know the value of money
and not humans, sinner!
Take it.
He saved my family.
Please don't insult him.
I'll even sell my shop
to repay your loan.
Allow the proceedings
to continue.
He's like my father.
Forget about his sons.
I'll repay his loan.
Kotaiah, just like them, I'll also repay
the loan by serving you. Move away.
Kotaiah, take my gold chain.
Please go.
Take my ring.
Whatever you want to donate,
put them in this plate.
Don't throw them down. Stop.
To hell with you!
Take it.
Here is the blank cheque.
Fill it with any amount you want.
Do you know about Mr. Raghuram?
I don't have to know
about Mr. Raghuram.
His son who said that he is no way
connected to his father's debts,
tell what Raghuram is to his son.
I don't give a penny
without pledging anything.
Do you know why I gave money to that
noble man without pledging anything?
In this world, I love this
noble man more than money.
Hey...
The day he came to my house,
accepted his defeat & asked money,
I had decided to forfeit
my money the day I gave him.
But knowing that he was defeated
by sinners like you, I came to his rescue.
You were all ready to sacrifice
anything for this noble man.
But as his son, he was ready to
go away without litting pyre,
and leaving this noble man's
body to the dogs.
Though he died,
I didn't want him to lose,
and I wanted a change
in these sinners.
That's why I did all this.
Please forgive me.
I'm money minded
but not a bad man.
Please try to understand me.
Please forgive me.
Take this cheque too & enjoy.
Uncle, please forgive me.
When you were alive,
we never understood your greatness.
Father, please forgive me.
Take this, uncle.
We don't need this money.
We only need our father.
We'll stand on our legs.
We don't need this money.
Whoever has given money
to my father,
please come and
take back your money.
We don't need money.
They won't come and take.
If they take back the money, it means
they don't respect your father.
Carry on with the proceedings.
No Shekar, you shouldn't
lit the pyre.
No. You're not worthy
to lit the pyre.
I was wrong in stopping him in every
attempt he made to correct them.
Since we ourselves killed
a man who cared for us,
we don't have the right
to lit his pyre.
Sir...
He loved his family and
you all equally.
His family killed him.
But you all saved his honour.
Only you have the right
to lit his pyre.
For his soul to rest in peace,
you all must lit his pyre.
Please don't say no.
Those 4 people.
I won...
They made me victorious.
I believed that this world runs
on love & not on money.
Those 4 people have made
my belief victorious.
You...?
Poor fellow!
Till now you were in
neck deep sorrows.
Sorrows means hell.
That's why we appeared
like hell boys to you.
Now that you're happy,
Happiness means heaven.
That's why we appear like
angels to you.
Come, let's go.
When we were born,
we bring nothing to this world.
People say that we don't take
anything with us when we die.
But I'm taking your love and
affection with me.
Farewell to our friend...
Farewell to our dear...
You live in our hearts...
Soul is reality...
Life is truth...
Your deeds live in
this world forever...
While living be
helpful to others...
After death become
a memory of solace...
Your love and affection
is spread by...
...those 4 people...
