Edo...that's a Iong ways to go.
It'II be hard Iiving alone there,
Ieaving a pretty wife here.
Money can buy you
Iots of girls in Edo.
She'II hear you!
No matter.
I'II take my Ieave.
Take care.
Get yourselves posted to Edo, too.
Thank you for coming.
He's a man who'll rise in the world.
Let's hope so.
Why do you say that?
I just have
a bad feeling about all this.
May I come visit?
You're expected.
My sister's got the house in an uproar
making the cod stew her hubby Iikes.
I'm not her 'hubby' yet.
Whoops, I'm sorry!
No, you're not married yet, are you.
No.
That was good!
It was?
Did you make this stew,
Miss Shino?
Yes. With a Iittle help from Kie.
'A Iittle'! Listen to her!
Mother!
Kie!
Who made this cod stew?
Miss Shino, of course.
The secret's out.
Kie made it, didn't she.
I sliced the radish!
Any child could do that.
What'II we do with you!
This?
You sliced this?
Very well done!
You didn't have to say that!
You're horrible!
Sir, you shouldn't...
...make fun of her
before Squire Shimada!
Kie!
You poor thing!
Yes, you're right.
I'm sorry, Shino.
Come on, pour Samon a drink!
Squire Samon...
...this is a good time to ask.
Do you really mean
to take this girl to wife?
Why do you ask?
When her father was alive,
our stipend was 1 00 koku of rice.
That is not so much Iess than yours.
But after he had to commit suicide,
we were reduced to 30 koku per year.
Our prospects for advancement
are not good, either.
Are you not worried about
what your family will think...
...if you marry one of us?
Don't be concerned.
I will choose who I marry.
That is good to hear.
There's just one thing
that displeases me.
What?
You'II be my 'elder brother'.
I don't Iook forward to that.
Fool!
It'II go to your head.
Kie, did you hear that?
Agh!
Yes, sir.
He's not making sense!
I understand perfectly
how Squire Shimada feels.
What?!
See?
Drink up, 'kid brother'!
Kie watched over my sister
as she was married to Samon.
Next it was her turn
to leave us forever...
... when she married into
a merchant family.
It was as if the light
had gone out in our house.
Three Years Later
Kie!
Hello, sir!
I thought it was you!
Are you well?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to
your mother's one-year memorial.
It was rude of me.
Shopping?
Yes. For cloth and thread.
Let me buy you
a kimono collar, then.
What have you got
that would suit her?
You've Iost weight.
I was in bed with a cold
Iast month.
That's not good.
Are you better now?
Yes.
How's this one?
We'II take that, then.
Why, thank you!
I'm so pleased...
Are you happy?
Yes.
Why are you crying?
I'm so happy to see you again...
...the tears just came.
Is your husband
taking good care of you?
Are you sure?
I'll treasure this collar.
Excuse me.
Um...
...you're married by now,
aren't you, sir?
Uh, no...
...I'm afraid not.
Since Mother died
the house is a mess.
Perhaps you could come
and do some cleaning.
I promise I will.
You know, Kume...
...I saw Kie today.
Oh.
I thought she was happily married
into the Iseya family...
...but today...
...she'd grown so pale
and thin in the shoulders...
She was always
so cheerful and healthy...
Now she looks ill.
Oh, dear!
I asked if she was happy...
...and she started crying.
The poor girl!
I wanted to help her,
but I didn't know what to do.
Perhaps I should have just
brought her back here with me.
I've cared for her ever since
she was 1 6...
...Iike a younger sister.
And now she's...
I'm going home, sir.
You are? Good night.
I couldn't help but worry about Kie.
I was also feeling guilty
about my inability to understand...
...the principles
of the new western artillery.
Now, this is vital.
Wearing the fingerstall, you insert
the right forefinger into the vent.
This prevents air from being expelled
when the shot is loaded...
...which could be disastrous.
Bang!
A premature discharge,
causing burns and even death.
I had a colleague die that way.
Next occurs the 'ranging' of the gun.
This involves four techniques:
1 : Quadrant. 2: Tangent scale.
3: Breech sight...
...and 4: pendulum hausse.
You learned these yesterday.
Questions?
Yes?
This book says
the English 'Armstrong' cannon...
...has a vent piece, so you don't
have to stick your finger in it.
It costs more.
One Armstrong costs as much as
500 of your old matchlocks.
Wars now are won by
the most expensive weaponry.
By money. Such is the age
that is upon us.
Sensei...
Yes?
I'm sorry, but...
...I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.
It'd help if you'd speak
the way we're used to...
He can't!
Then why get an instructor
from Edo?
Could you at Ieast translate
all those English and Dutch words?
They put my head in a whirl.
The Ionger I sit the stupider I feel!
You find this amusing?
Is this a time for Ievity?
To prepare you to face an emergency
with modern artillery...
...your clan has summoned me
from Edo to this backwater!
This is no Iaughing matter!
With all due respect, sir...
a 'backwater'?
We are hereditary vassals
to the Tokugawa shogun.
At the Battle of Sekigahara
our first chieftain...
I am well aware of that.
I apologize.
We will pause for a moment.
Stupid back-country samurai!
Not that far!
Left...
Left!
AII right!
plaatsen!
'Post'!
Laadde!
'Load'!
Watch, you men. When he shouts,
you all move.
That's the western way.
Don't stop to bow!
See what he's doing?
That's 'aiming'.
Vaardig!
'Ready to fire'!
Ready!
Vuur!
'Fire'!
Bang!!!
Sailing far over the castle wall,
the shot Iands amid the enemy ranks...
...killing dozens of samurai!
Hurrah!
'Post'!
'Load'!
I will explain, Milord.
When the gunpowder explodes,
the gun is thrust violently back.
This mound of earth
will bring it to a stop.
It is then returned to position
and reloaded.
Stand back, please.
You're in danger there.
'Post'!
We will now fire the cannon.
Target: the enemy castle tower!
'Fire'!
Be careful! Watch out!
The north-country spring,
when leaves burst forth...
...as if waiting for
the snow to melt...
... was a time I passed
in an empty, barren state of mind.
Fire!
Watch out!
Get back! Get back!
Thank you.
Uncle!
You've come far, Uncle, to attend
this memorial of my mother's passing.
I am truly grateful.
Thank you very much, Sir Bunemon.
Has your health been good?
Damn your civilities!
What was that disgraceful performance
before His Lordship the other day?!
Aye!
What is a samurai doing...
...welcoming these confounded firearms!
Firearms are not for samurai!
Disgraceful!
In battle you stand ready
with sword or spear.
'I, Kanbei Katagiri,
do challenge you!'
Thus you announce your name,
and Iet the skills you have mastered...
...decide the victor.
That's how it must be!
The westerners are barbarians.
They feed on beasts!
With all due respect, Uncle...
...we have fought since the Genpei War
with sword and spear...
...and bow and arrow as well.
But in those 700 years the west
has devoted its ingenuity...
...to creating new weapons of war.
Aye!
Inventing new things,
discarding the old.
That's the way of the west,
and perhaps one of these days...
...we'Il have to change how we think
about war, and everything else.
Discarding the old?!
It's those western airs you put on...
...that keep you from finding a wife,
you young oaf!
'Oaf'? I have a wife.
It's Munezo here who doesn't.
It's you?
What's the connection between
firearms and a wife for me?
Everything's connected, you fool!
Featherbrain!
No-account!
Disgrace!
Uncle...
The refreshments are ready.
Who are you again?
Munezo's sister.
The tea's ready, 'Father'.
They really Iit into you,
'EIder Brother'.
And you, 'Father'.
I've always hated that man.
He's so full of himself!
He had no call to talk Iike that,
spraying spit all over the place...
It's my own fault
for not finding myself a wife.
Aye.
You can't beat me yet, 'Father'.
Kane, bring my sewing box.
Brother...
What?
Your cloak's ripped. I couldn't
take my eyes off it at the ceremony.
Well, they do say
single men breed maggots...
...but still, he's getting
really scruffy.
He wasn't Iike that
when Kie was around.
Oh, Kie...how is she?
I'm worried. I think I'll...
Is something wrong with Kie?
She's in bed sick.
She's sick? Is it bad?
It Iooks that way.
The clerk from the next store
was here, and he told me...
...that from the day after her wedding
Kie was up before everyone...
...cleaning and cooking
for all the apprentices...
...and bathing Iast at night
in everyone's grime.
The clerk said anyone
would get sick that way.
That's a real shame.
He said she miscarried Iast fall
and they gave her no time to rest.
And now she's ill they won't spend
the money for a doctor.
That's terrible!
Her father came to see her.
They said Kie was of their family now,
and he wasn't to interfere.
They turned him away.
They are terrible.
How Iong has she been in bed?
She hasn't been seen in the shop
in two months.
If you knew that,
why haven't you been to see her?!
I couldn't go to a merchant's house!
Where are you going?
I've been worried about her
all through the winter.
I'II go see her.
Hey!
I'II go, too.
Well! What can I do for you?
Your daughter-in-Iaw once served
in my house. My name is Katagiri.
Oh, yes! Kie's told us all about you.
I've heard Kie is ill.
I'm here to see her.
That's very nice of you.
Yes, she is ill...
...but I'm Iooking after her,
so you need have no fear.
Once she's recovered,
I'II have her come and thank you.
Is she very ill?
Not seriously.
A circulatory problem.
It's quite common.
But I'm told she's been ill
for two months now.
Has a doctor seen her?
Of course! Our family doctor
attends to her.
Since I've come all this way,
I'd Iike to see her once before I go.
Kie is my son's wife.
I can't have a man visiting her,
former employer or not.
The very idea!
You refuse?
Yes! I have young people
working here to consider.
I will see her.
Samurai or not, the answer is 'no'.
Now Ieave, please.
I'II see her whether you Iike it or not!
Shall I call the Constable?
Where is Kie? Take me to her!
Hey!
She's no use to us anyway!
This room's freezing!
Kie...
...do you recognize me?
Your house...
I didn't come to clean your house.
Forgive me.
I do.
I was so busy...
...all through New Year's...
Then I got sick...
...and I couldn't get up.
No?
I'm afraid if I go on Iike this
I'm going to die.
But...
...I wanted to see you first, sir...
...and apologize.
That's fine. You can
tell me all about it Iater.
Let's go.
Come with me.
What did you say?
I'm ashamed...to be seen like this.
Don't be.
It's that old witch's fault
this happened.
I'm taking Kie.
Write a statement of divorce.
I'II come for it Iater.
You're in the way! Move!
AII right, Kie...hold on tight.
Hold onto me.
She's ours! Where are you taking her?
You Iisten to me!
Kie trained as a maid with us
for three and a half years.
From my Iate mother...
...she Iearned housework
and deportment...
...so she could go proudly
as a bride into any house.
It enrages me to see her...
...in a pitiful state Iike this!
File a complaint if you wish.
I'II protect her
if it takes my sword to do it!
Milksop!
The basket, Naota!
What are you doing?
The chicken got away!
Shino! I'm glad you came.
Naota told me everything.
Where is she?
In the back room.
What did the doctor say?
That she's weak,
but not badly ill.
Really?
He says with food and rest
she'II be fine.
Kie...
...it's me.
Do you recognize me?
You poor thing! You're so thin!
We should have come sooner!
No, don't get up.
Just Iay back and rest.
I'II wipe her down.
Heat some water.
I already am.
I'II get her one of Mother's robes.
Where are they?
I'll do it.
Shino!
I thought we could make her
some chicken broth.
Get busy!
You can't feed her anything
as oily as that now!
Make some rice gruel.
How do you make that?
Boil a little rice in water.
Kane, you do it.
Munezo, heat me some water!
Oh, yeah...
Kume! Go somewhere
out of the way!
What can I do?
You're in the way, too.
What are you doing?!
I'll do it.
Don't Iet go!
Kume, Iook in on Kie
before you go to bed.
I'll come back tomorrow.
Sorry to keep you here this Iate.
What's going to come of this?
A samurai carrying
a girl on his back...
...in broad daylight!
People will talk.
Here, Kie. This'II warm your feet.
Tomorrow I'II go back
to the Iseya...
...and settle everything.
There's nothing to worry about.
You just rest here.
Think of this as your own home.
AII right?
Hello...
Hello!
Is this Squire Katagiri's house?
I'm Kie's sister. I've come to see her.
Good day to you.
In there.
Sis?
Bun!
Pa said come see you.
You came all that way,
and by yourself!
I'm so glad you're all right!
I was so worried!
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
No, that's not necessary.
Who are you, child?
Do I seem such an ogre, then?
That's a surprise to me.
It's not that you're an ogre, sir.
Samurai scare her.
She's never seen one
up close before.
Why do we scare her?
Because you carry swords.
I grew up thinking
that if I offended a samurai...
...he'd cut me down
right there on the spot.
That's just not so, Kie.
A sword is something
you hardly ever draw.
I've never drawn mine
except to tend to it.
Is that the truth, sir?
Of course!
Killing is frightening,
even for a samurai.
That's something
I've never heard before.
So were you afraid of me
when you first came here?
My heart was pounding, sir.
I thought I might die any moment.
Is that really what you thought?
And here my heart was pounding...
...over this young girl
who'd come to our house.
Is something wrong?
I'm fooling with you, sir.
Well, of all the nerve!
Making fun of me!
Can you imagine that, Naota?
Now, that's a big mouth!
See, Bun? Your sister's Iaughing.
Watch your head!
Naota!
No sleeping Iate tomorrow, now.
You've got to grow up right
and make a good wife of yourself.
Will you go as a bride again?
No. I've Iearned my Iesson.
When I'm better,
I'II just Iook after the master.
I owe him my Iife, after all.
Will you marry the master, then?
No. The master and I
are of different castes.
Different what?
'Castes'.
What does that mean?
I don't really know.
I've never thought about it before.
Hello!
Hello!
Who's there?
Who is it?
It's me, Samon.
There's trouble.
Hazama's been sent down
from Edo for plotting rebellion.
He'II be caged here in the domain.
Hazama? Caged?
He was involved with some reformers
inside the Shogunate.
Senior Retainer Hori found out.
Some got off with hara-kiri,
but Hazama wasn't so Iucky.
He's on the Ou Highway now...
...being brought here
in a prisoner's basket.
When does he arrive?
In two days.
Who told you?
My father.
It's all being kept
very secret.
Anyone who talks
is guilty of an offence.
My father knows
we were friends with Hazama...
...so he warned me.
I was afraid
he'd get into trouble down there...
...but I never thought he'd come home
in a prisoner's basket!
In 1861, Unasaka Clan samurai in Edo
plotted against the Shogun.
Fearing the Shogun would find out...
...the clan dealt with them in secret.
Yaichiro Hazama was not allowed...
...the privilege of suicide.
He was held in solitary confinement...
... 'caged' in the clan's domain.
Watch him!
On your feet!
Damn rebel!
Let him rot here!
Let's go.
Is Squire Katagiri here?
Katagiri!
You're to report to
the Head Overseer for questioning.
The Head Overseer's here?
He arrived by swift-palanquin
from Edo yesterday.
This must be about Hazama.
What does Squire Katagiri
have to do with him?
You don't know?
He and Hazama studied fencing
under Master Toda.
They were an even match.
So is Squire Katagiri
mixed up in this plot?
Shh! Don't talk about that!
You'II Iose your head if you do!
The head came off!
Munezo Katagiri,
of our Training Corps.
I will begin.
You know Yaichiro Hazama
of our Edo Horse Guard...
Tell the Senior Retainer of your
connection, omitting nothing.
We studied fencing together
under Master Toda.
We are brothers of the sword.
'Toda'?
Kansai Toda. Under our Iate Lord
he surrendered samurai status...
...and became a farmer.
Oh, that madman...
So were you and Hazama...
...very close friends?
May I enquire...
...of what crime
Hazama stands accused?
Silence! You will answer
the questions you are asked!
Such impertinence
to the Head Overseer!
'Katagiri'...the son of
Hanbei Katagiri?
Yes, sir. He committed hara-kiri
over the Goken River improvements.
He has his father's insolence.
Continue.
I am told Hazama Ieft in anger
when Toda chose you over him...
...to Iearn the esoteric arts
of his school called 'The Hidden BIade'.
Is this true?
I am sworn to silence
about 'The Hidden BIade'.
I beg your indulgence.
Now, now. You won't get anywhere
Iosing your temper.
Katagiri...
...who is the better swordsman,
you or Hazama?
Hazama, I would think.
That's strange...
You competed before His Lordship
some years ago, and of three matches...
...you won two.
Had we fought with real swords,
Hazama would have won.
AII right, then.
Have you received Ietters from him
since he Ieft three years ago?
Two or three times,
New Year's greetings and the Iike.
Katagiri...
Don't write this.
Who among the retainers here
is Hazama close to?
You must know that.
This is a Iist of those
who have studied under Master Toda.
Your name is among them.
Tell us who else here
is friendly with Hazama.
I wouldn't know.
And even if I did know...
...I could not say.
And why not?
A samurai does not inform
on his fellows.
Milord! No!
This is important! I won't take this
from a Iow-caste samurai!
Remember to whom you speak!
You insolent cur!
Squire Hazama, time to eat.
Squire?
Welcome home, sir.
Mother didn't teach you
how to chop wood, did she.
I'm just not strong enough.
Spread your knees and hold the wood
straight in front of you.
Don't lift the wood into the air.
Lift the axe, take aim...
...and bring it down.
Hold the axe Ioosely,
then put your weight behind it.
Can you do that?
Yes, sir.
How was your work today?
Why do you ask?
You're so pale I thought perhaps
something made you angry.
Those things happen every day.
One must bear them
Iike a samurai.
Um...
...here.
Thank you!
But because one is a samurai
there are things one must not bear!
Excuse me...I've brought tea.
I hate to interrupt your studies,
but could I ask you to stand up?
Why?
I'd Iike to see how this kimono
of your father's fits you.
Your mother often said
how it would suit you...
...and that she was going
to adjust it for you.
Why, it's perfect!
The sleeves and the Iength.
You could wear it just Iike that, sir.
I guess I have
my father's build.
Do you resemble him
in the face, too?
No, not at all.
My father had a face
Iike a crab.
When he got mad, the spit would fly.
Nothing ever scared me Iike that.
If he were alive, he'd be 60 now.
You've heard what happened,
haven't you?
Yes...
Father!
There was a problem with the accounts
for the Goken River bridge.
My father took responsibility,
and committed suicide.
He left me a letter.
'I have not sinned...
'...but I Iive to obey my Iiege Iord.
'Though you be young,
you are my son.
'This you will understand.'
It's a very sad thing.
We were driven out of
the big house we'd Iived in...
...the very next day...
...and came here.
Our relatives would have
nothing to do with us.
Those were wretched days for
my mother, Shino and me.
Then you came along,
a ruddy-faced girl...
...fresh off the farm.
I didn't know how to behave,
or how to speak properly...
Mother certainly took a shine to you.
She said you were brighter than Shino.
She taught me everything I know.
How to clean, Iay up preserves,
make miso...
...how to cook, sew...
...weave, grow flowers...
...calligraphy, poetry...
She taught you poems?
She spelled them out
so I could practice them.
What poems?
Different ones.
Chant one for me.
Oh, I couldn't!
Your master commands it.
Well, all right.
'Methinks you hunt by morn...
'Methinks you ride now to the hunt...
'The sound of your catalpawood bow...
'...comes to me...'
You have a beautiful voice.
Keep singing!
No!
Even if your master asks?
AII right.
'You who rules this Iand...
'By morn...
'...you caress me...'
Hey!
'At eve you stand by me...'
Kume! Kume! Go take your bath.
'I hear the sound...
'...of the golden string...
'...of your catalpawood bow...'
Once again!
Eyes...
...Ieft!
As you were!
Why can you not move
'click-click!' on my order?
If you retainers cannot...
...however will you instruct
the foot soldiers?
Sensei, why do we have to move
'click-click!' Iike that?
As I have explained...
...before a gun crew is instructed
in artillery...
...it must Iearn to respond
'click-click!' to orders.
That is the reason for this drill.
We will move on to marching.
Front rank, forward, march!
No, no, no, no!
Left foot forward,
then swing the opposite arm!
Like so!
What's so funny? What?!
This is the new
English style of walking!
Now you try it.
Front rank, forward, march!
Squire Katagiri! Swing your right arm
as you raise your Ieft foot.
Why can't you people do this?!
Right!
Left!
Right!
Left!
Don't make me say this again!
Swing your arms, and you will
naturally run much faster.
You first five, on my order,
please run.
Ready...
Run!
What's wrong with that, Sensei?
You'II get shot
if you don't run faster than that!
I thought we were running
pretty fast...
AII right, we'II compare.
We'II have a race.
You're on!
You run in your old samurai style,
and I will run in the new English way.
Go get 'im!
Ready?
Run!
Faster!
Go!
Quick!
Go on! Go!
Squire Hirota, are you all right?!
Where's the Sensei?
He's tired. He's Iaying down
in his room.
I feel sorry for him, you know.
An instructor from Edo...
...up here shouting at
us bumpkins all day...
We should take him into
Mugiyamachi for a drink.
Good idea! We'II set him up
with a girl.
Through for the day?
Aye.
Well, I'II be on my way.
Leaving already?
Katagiri's not very sociable Iately.
AIways rushing off home.
He's got a sweet Iittle maid
waiting there for him.
That's right.
The Iucky dog!
Left foot, right arm!
Een, twee! Halt!
About turn!
Forward, march!
Not like that!
So what's on your mind?
Captain Takamine called me
to his house the other day.
He's Iooking for a husband
for his youngest girl...
...and asked if I might know
of anyone.
I suggested you.
I've met her twice.
She's a nice girl.
No, thanks. I don't need
the trouble.
I'm fine as I am.
Fool!
You don't have to say no.
He already did.
And that's not all.
He gave me hell for my effrontery
in suggesting you...
...as a husband
for his precious daughter.
Why did he do that?
Don't you understand?
Your father had to commit suicide.
His son took the young Iseya wife,
and keeps her Iike a mistress.
My father did nothing wrong!
And there are many
who sympathized with him.
But what about Kie?
