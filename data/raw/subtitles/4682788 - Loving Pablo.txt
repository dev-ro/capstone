 Tower, this is Delta Charlie  7221...
 request permission  to enter U.S. airspace.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  I've had to leave a house...
 in the middle of the night...
 because of a man before...
 but this is the first time  I've had to leave a country.
 TOWER (OVER RADIO)  Delta Charlie 7221...
 you are clear to enter.
 PILOT (OVER SPEAKER)  Okay, folks...
 we are now entering United  States airspace.
[SHEPARD] You're safe now.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  I've made this trip before.
 There were always dozens  of white roses...
 waiting for me in every  suite...
but the men waiting at the door  did not wear uniforms.
 They wore Armani.
So, Virginia...
over the next few days, you'll meet with officials...
from the Justice Department and they will inform you...
of the procedure to follow from now on.
Can someone get me an aspirin, please?
My head is going to explode.
Ma'am, for your own safety you do not leave this room...
or communicate with anyone.
I have two of my men standing outside.
Do you understand?
Can you get them bring me an aspirin, please?
Virginia, American hotels don't give out aspirin anymore.
It's considered a drug in this country.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) Pablo would  have laughed at that, too.
 Then he would have had them  all killed.
Come on!
The horse! There it is!
Fucking horse!
Good Lord, poor animal.
We have to finish him, Patrón.
Do it, Pelado.
 Because you're not a cowboy.
Did you see the guest list?
It's full of beautiful women.
Colombia is full of beautiful women, mi amor.
It's a party.
Actresses, beauty queens.
And soccer players, union delegates.
You're much more beautiful. Look.
Than the union delegates?
Look who's coming.
I don't like it, Pablo.
Business and family is separate. We've already talked about it.
I know, I know, I know.
With the party, everything is a little bit of a mess.
I'll take care of it.
( DOOR OPENS, CLOSES )
I have the gatillero you asked for.
I'll talk to him and then you take him away.
I don't want him around.
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
If you can find this coin, you can keep it!
Go for it.
Patrón, what do you want me to do?
We have a little job for you in Leticia.
There's a file there from seven years ago...
linking me to the murder of two DAS agents.
You have to make it disappear, okay?
Everything you find.
You have contacts there, right?
Patrón, my cousin's wife works at the courthouse.
She can get me in, there's no problem.
Dad!
I don't care if you have to take out somebody...
or what you have to do.
You can burn the building down if you want...
but get rid of that file.
You have 30,000 for expenses for traveling...
for ammunition, for rumba, for everything.
If you run out, ask Salvador for more. He will--
Dad!
He will take care of everything. Make it quick.
Yes, Patrón.
Did you find the coin?
It's only five pesos!
Only five pesos?
Juan Pablo, do you know how hard your daddy has to work...
to make some money? Give me the coin back.
Only five pesos.
 ( MUSIC PLAYING )
Is that the hacienda down there?
We've been flying over it for a while, my love.
 ( INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER ) We're being kidnapped.
It's okay, Virgie, calm down.
It's not okay.
Do you know how much all of us here are worth?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) We'd all heard  about our host...
 but none of us had ever  met him.
 His name is at the top of the  list of the nouveau rich...
 a group of young men  that have made...
 huge fortunes in very  little time.
Welcome.
Please, don't mind the weapons. They are for the animals.
We have a little zoo here. Would you like to see it?
You scared us to death.
Tell our host this is no way to welcome guests.
As soon as I see him.
There they are.
Oh, my God, they are beautiful.
They are very happy here. They like Colombia.
That's because they don't read the papers.
This house is gigantic.
I don't see the servants anywhere.
There you have them.
VIRGINIA (V.O.) These new elite  has its own social structure.
 Down in the corridors,  the soldiers:
 young, uneducated men  from the slums...
 warriors in the organization.
 They are nothing like the  humble servants working...
 on the ranches of the  traditionally rich...
 people in my country.
 They are confident.
 They handle security and  operations, and...
How you doing, Senora Virginia?
Buenos Noches.
 ...have good taste in women.
Virginia, I never miss your show.
You look so beautiful.
Thank you, ma'am. You look magnificent.
VIRGINIA (V.O.) Above them, the cream: artists, business men...
 soccer players, journalists,  models...
 always a perfect distance away  from our host.
Congratulations, Victor.
There are so many handsome guys here.
Who made that beautiful dress for you?
Thank you.
Anyone who's anyone is here.
My God, where does he make all this money?
That's the question no reporter dares to ask.
 Miss Vallejo, it's an honor to  have you here tonight.
 An admirer of yours wants to  dedicate you this song.
 Let's see what you say!
Virginia. Virginia.
Ave Maria, where have you been hiding?
Pablo keeps asking for you.
He's driving us crazy, so come on.
Victor, wait here. Don't fall in love with a Paisa!
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  And up the hill...
 the kings of the White  Mountain.
 We still don't know their  names...
 but soon there won't be a  single Colombian who doesn't.
She was easy to find.
I just went where all the men were looking.
Pablo? Pablo Escobar?
No.
Your complaints were passed on to me, so I beg your pardon.
You lied to me.
Ave María, of course I lied to you.
I didn't want you to leave.
You look even prettier in person.
Then I'll have to fire my make-up girl.
There's a lot of talk about you over there.
Speculations about your past.
No, no, no, no.
Don't -- don't -- don't listen to that.
I only listen when they speculate about my future.
I already know my past.
And what's the occasion?
This is the founding of a society.
What kind of society?
Philanthropic.
We are building houses for the poor.
Nobody over there mentioned to you Medellín Sin Tugurios?
No.
Well, we're going to build 2,000 homes...
for the people at the garbage dump.
I got a good price on a lot.
And where does the money come from?
What, is this an interview?
I'm a journalist.
Then come and see it.
Come and see it, I'll show it to you.
It's good for the country to know.
Good for the country or good for you?
Am I not part of the country?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) We weren't  aware at the time...
 but that night we were  celebrating...
 the founding of the  Medellín Cartel...
 and the crowning of Pablo  as its king.
 Things were about to change  forever.
 In Colombia and in my life.
Pablo! Pablo!
Breathe through your mouth, so you can get used to it fast.
And watch where you step, people dump bodies out here sometimes.
You're kidding.
Pablo! Pablo!
Pablito, is your mom getting better?
Pablito, Don Pablo is here, come on!
Is everybody here named Pablo?
Everybody. They named them after him.
Listen. We are now finishing the first 600...
but we're going to build 2000, eh? 2,000.
My God!
 Good morning, Mr. Escobar...
 please tell our viewers the  motivation and goal...
 behind this wonderful  initiative...
 Medellín sin Tugurios.
 Well, it is painful for us to  see so many children starving.
 Completely unprotected by the  government, and, uh...
building these houses for them helps us to create a country...
 that we always dreamed about.
 I love Colombia, and now that  we have the chance...
to give back to this beautiful country that gave us so much...
 that is exactly what  we're doing.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) That day  I decide that I don't care...
 how Pablo makes his money,  only how he uses it.
Such injustice is the reason behind Medellín sin Tugurios.
This way, please.
Virginia, how beautiful!
Thank you, my dear. Bon appétit.
Thank you.
How are you?
Do you know that people?
I like the way you laugh. You laugh, like on your show.
You are so relaxed on TV, how do you do that?
Do you think I could ever do that?
There are tricks. Are you after my job?
No, I'm not. Are you married?
Not by choice.
What does he do?
He's a plastic surgeon.
We are separated, but he doesn't want to sign the divorce.
Oh, he doesn't want you to get married again?
No, he doesn't want to have to marry...
one of his teenage girlfriends.
Ah.
Well, that can be fixed.
You'll talk to him?
Yeah.
I don't like hanging around with married women, I don't.
So next time we are going out, you're not going to be his wife.
No?
No. Will I be his widow?
Ave Maria, Virginia, who do you take me for?
[WOMAN] Hey! Hey, wait!
( ALL YELLING )
Everyone ready?
Virginia, your lawyer called...
your ex signed the papers!
We are on in three... What?
two...
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) To celebrate  me being free again...
 Pablo takes me to an island  paradise only he knows about.
 If you're going to cry  over a man...
 better on a private jet  than on a bus.
Where are you going?
They're waiting.
Who?
 ( MUSIC PLAYING )
Do I look okay?
You look perfect.
How's it going, Patrón? Ma'am.
Let's make a deal.
You tell me your secrets and I'll tell you mine.
Okay?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Our trip is an excuse...
 to attend a congress of drug  traffickers.
Gentlemen, Virginia Vallejo.
Virginia, how are you? When did you arrive?
Today.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Pablo introduces me...
 to his associates  in the cartel.
 He shows me off to them  like a trophy...
 and I know that they are also  there to evaluate me.
 Between them they form a new  social class...
 the narco millionaires,  and I'm the only journalist...
 with exclusive access to their  first summit.
Thank you. I'm going to get a drink.
Stay close, Virginia. These men can't be trusted.
Okay?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) The most illegal thing I've ever done...
 before that day was  to double park.
( GIGGLES )
 But the truth is, never in my  life had I felt safer.
All of our products is labeled with a color...
that doesn't change, so whoever buys it--
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  That night they split...
 the United States of America  among them.
Florida for the Medellín Cartel...
 New York for the Cali  Cartel.
 The independents add their  shipments to Pablo's.
 They know that nobody would  ever dare...
 to steal even one gram  from him.
 Seeing him in his natural  habitat, he's addictive.
 Thanks to those men...
 it is going to snow cocaine  in the U.S.

Pull up to the side, up off to the side.
 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)  From the White House...
 President and Mrs. Ronald  Reagan, a message on drugs.
 Despite our best efforts...
illegal cocaine is coming into our country at alarming levels.
 It's especially damaging  to the young people...
 on whom our future depends.
 So tonight, from our family  to yours...
 from our home to yours,  thank you for joining us.
 America has accomplished so  much in these last few years.
Welcome, Agent Shepard.
The president is glad to have you on board.
Thank you. This is Mr. Velarde...
representing the Colombian government.
Nice to meet you.
The president is worried about the latest report.
Cocaine is no longer the drug of the jet set...
it's reaching the middle class.
You know what that means.
It's coming in without control.
80 percent is coming from Colombia.
We're working to have an old bilateral treaty reactivated.
The Extradition Treaty.
We'll catch the narcos and turn them over...
so you can try them here.
They don't fear the judges in Colombia...
they either bribe them or kill them.
But they do fear your justice.
Is there a legal basis for this?
The coke is produced in my country, but it's consumed here.
The crime is completed in the United States.
I brought a draft.
The President knows your record.
He wants you to monitor the whole process.
The President will be over shortly.
We are hoping to implement this in the next day or so--
 Drugs take away the dream  from every child's heart...
 and replace it with a  nightmare.
 And it's time we in America  stand up...
 and replace those dreams.
What are we, children?
Don't we have judges here?
No mother sends her children to the neighbors to be punished.
No.
What do the lawyers have to say? Is constitutional?
Can it be appealed?
Yeah, it'll be appealed.
No, we have to knock it down.
That treaty puts us in danger to everyone here...
every one of you, every one of us.
Si.
We have to fight it from the institutions from the inside.
From Congress?
It's the only way.
Throw money at them, both sides.
Conservatives and liberals, they all like the good stuff.
Yeah, my Pablo, the spotlight is bad for business.
And whatever they look for in your house...
they'll find in everyone else's.
Listen to us, please.
They'll go after you.
Politics is a bitch.
No, hermano, it's the other way around.
If you reach Congress, they respect you. Why?
Because you're one of them.
You know how much it costs to run...
for the state council in Colombia?
Ten million pesos. Ten million pesos.
And for senator, I think it is...
between 100 and 120 million pesos.
1,500 million pesos more or less for President of the Republic.
Tell me, who can spend that kind of money?
The son of a farmer? A worker? No. No.
Politics comes down to money here...
democracy comes down to money here, so...
we have plenty of money.

I'm sorry, sir, but if they're armed, they cannot come in.
Look, look, listen.

If they can't come in, the donation can't either.
So go ask your candidate if that's what he wants.
Do it.
Do it, man.
Wait a minute.
VIRGINIA (V.O.) The cartel bets  on both horses.
 Why put money on only one  candidate...
when you can put money on both?
 That way no matter who wins,  they win.
 The narcos' planes carry  candidates during the day...
 and fly to the United States  at night.
 And what do they get  in exchange?
If you defend the competency of the Supreme Court...
to question the constitutionality...
of the Extradition Treaty...
it will be good for all of us, candidate.
These gentlemen are willing to donate 25 million pesos...
to our campaign here.
Yes.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) People call  the contributions...
 made by the drug lords  "hot money." Why?
It's okay. You can leave it on the floor.
We'll find someone to pick it up later.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Because it burns.
How far are you going to take this, Pablo?
We're doing fine. Don't we have enough?
My love, in Congress I can get things done. I can help people.
Help your family first.
You have money, Pablo. You have us.
What more do you want?
I want respect.
Respect?
Mm-hmm. I want respect.
I want my son to be proud of me.
Is that so hard to understand?
First, he'd have to see you, Pablo, but you're never home.
Juan Pablo, buddy, go to the living room.
There's nothing on TV?
Ave Maria, who bought him that car?
Victoria, my love, don't you want to be the First Lady?
I'd settle for being the only lady, Pablo.
Ave Maria. No, not again.
She's helping me with my political campaign.
I want respect, too, Pablo, like you.
I respect you.
No, sir. The difference is yours is enough for me.
-I respect you. -No, you don't.
-I do. -You don't.
I -- I'll prove it. What do you want me to do?
What? I'll do it. What?
That bitch from TV... end it with her.
I promise right now it is over now.
Now. Right now.

I know that, but don't worry.

Thank you.
Miss Vallejo?
Yes? Do we know each other?
Do you have any plans?
Can I have a moment of your time?
Do you lack self-confidence, Agent Shepard?
Give me two hours?
Sure.
I saw your interview with Mr. Escobar.
Thousands of people saw it.
What can you tell me about him?
So disappointing. You're not interested in me.
You're interested in Pablo.
I am a married man.
So you know how he makes his money?
What does your embassy over there tell you?
Nothing good.
Well, Mr. Escobar is an elected government representative.
So I don't think the DEA has any legal authority...
to interfere in Colombian politics.
The drugs produced in your country are entering mine...
and that worries us.
No. No.
Your government is only worried about the money...
leaving the country, not the drugs that come in.
They don't have this problem with the Italian mafia...
because what they make stays here.
Drug money is different. It flies away.
That's what worries you.
What did he say? Pablo?
When you told him that you were coming to meet me...
what did he say?
He said to make sure the United States pays the bill.
You two are involved.
You have the nerve to ask me that?
Why don't you ask your friends at the CIA?
I will.
You know what? I would have agreed to a drink.
Even without the badge.
Where is Pablo?
He had to go to Bogotá, Congress is holding a special session.
They want to revoke his appointment.
They cannot do that.
Well, that bastard Minister of Justice has it out for us.
He requested the review.
Things are getting wild, Virginia.
The whole country is watching us. We are in the spotlight.
Congressmen, this is a disgrace!
These men who became inexplicably rich overnight...
have reached this sacred institution...
with their shady dealings.
Their presence in the House is an insult to every Colombian!
Congressman Escobar...
it certainly must have been quite a struggle...
for you to obtain your fortune.
And to go from having a few properties in Medellín...
to accumulating more than $2 billion in less than two years!
President, honorable congressmen...
apparently his honor the Minister of Justice...
doesn't believe that a person of humble origin...
can through hard work...
reach a higher social position or a seat in this room.
Maybe you should question...
your own presence here, Senor Minister.
You don't believe in the justice that you represent...
and you want the justice system of another country...
for our judicial, so you don't deserve your position.
You should resign.
You have lied today by suggesting that my money...
is linked to drug trafficking.
That's why I'm giving Your Honor 24 hours...
to present solid evidence of your accusations against me.
Actually, you are the one who should explain the origin...
of the money that financed your campaign.
Mr. President, Mr. President, I will bring--
I will bring proof to this room of the quantities...
that you and some of your colleagues...
have received from certain people.
Yes.
Unlike you, solid proof.
When, where, and how much. Evidence.
Thank you very much, Mr. President.
Apparently, Congressman Escobar has detailed information...
about how drug trafficking operates...
which continues to surprise for a humble...
and hardworking man like himself.
Pablo, resign.
Leave! Leave before they kick you out.
I want my son to see me there, Victoria.
You don't want your son to see...
what the whole country saw today, Pablo.
Today. Today.
Those men clapping in there today...
and laughing in there today, they have a lot to hide.
The President publicly backed the Minister!
The President backs the Minister...
because he has a lot to hide, too!
Oh, so what are you going to do? Accuse the President as well?
In front of the whole country?
Pablo, you're a drug trafficker.
Those bastards, they stand up when I call them...
and they come to my parties and grab every penny I give them.
Those motherfuckers!
You promised me everything would be all right.
And everything is fine.

If you want to know about them, I'll let you know...
and you let me know which one you like the most.

He's a minister, Pablo. You can't kill a minister.
No? Who says that? You?
It's time to start killing people...
so they learn to respect us.
This is how it goes.
Every one of us put up ten million pesos for expenses...
so that way we're all committed.

There are no half winners and half losers.

Then I didn't mean to warn him.
Listen to me.
Lara won't be in the country for long.
They'll send him somewhere as an ambassador.
Then you can kill him.

And they will bring them just for you...
from the jungle, hungry for a woman.
And they will get on you one after another...
until they tear your vagina to pieces...
and then they will break bottles and they will stick...
those broken bottles in it, and they will stick blenders...
and hair dryers, and they will turn them on...
full-blast inside of you, yes.
And when you think you are going to faint, they will wake you...
up with cold water, so you are awake...
for the next group of soldiers.
Then they will let you bleed till you die from inside.
So this is why this is the best gift...
I can ever give you, my love. Take it.
If there are three coming at you, take out the first one...
the one who's closest.
And if there are four or more, then...
yes, you better kill yourself.
I -- I want to go. I want to go.
Don't cry.
I want to go.
Okay. I'll take you home.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Sicarios.
 The narco gives the boys  in the slums the education...
 they don't get from the  government.
 They don't mind dying, if they  can leave $20,000...
 to their mothers, because  they know that's more...
 then they will make  in a lifetime.
 ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )
 To be a good sicario,  you have to be more...
 than just prepared to kill.
You have to be prepared to die.

Good lord, Colombia is full of geniuses...
and intelligent people like you.
Juan, Carlos Andrés, thank you.
And now let's go to Cartegena where they are celebrating...
one of the biggest events in Colombia. No.
We just received a news update saying...
Oh my God.
Saying the Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla...
has been assassinated only minutes ago in Bogotá.
 In an emergency release, the president Belasario Betancur...
Mom?
 has called the minister's  murder...
 a crime against humanity.
[JUAN PABLO] What's wrong?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) And has  declared the country...
 in a state of siege.
 We'll be back with more  information...
 as we compile more  facts about what happened.
 Thank you.
( BELL RINGS )
 The government takes  on the mafia.
 President Betancur promises...
 to activate the extradition  treaty.
 The corporation relocates.
 Where?
 ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Where they keep the money.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) The cartel  proposes a negotiation...
 with the government, which  sends an ex-president...
 to hear Pablo's proposal.
Which at the present time...
control roughly 80 percent of global traffic.
We offer the repatriation of our capital abroad...
to boost the national economy and also pay our country's...
external debt, presently estimated at $12 billion.
In exchange, we request amnesty and the guarantee...
that under no circumstances, no circumstances...
we will be extradited to another country...
for any illicit activities that may have occurred to date.
You know things are very hot over there, after the minister.
Oh, yes, We were very sorry to hear about that, sir.
Listen closely, before we go on.
Ex-president Michelsen and myself are not here.
The president of the country has not authorized this meeting.
This isn't happening, is that clear?
A timely clarification, much in the very same way...
that my clients are sitting at this table...
representing third parties, rather than their own.
The extradition part is nonnegotiable.
We can't guarantee anything without the agreement...
of our North American partners.
Oh, the North American partners, the gringoes, who needs them?
This is a matter between Colombians.
Ave Maria.
You have to revoke that extradition treaty.
Revoke it.
Go and tell your president...
the one you are not representing here.
Yes, what's the other option? War?
And we all know what war is about.
The one who has more cash wins it, and look at us.
Who has more cash here?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Pablo couldn't keep his word.
 His daughter is born outside  Colombia.
I won't have it, Pablo.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) He holds the  people who drove him...
 from the country responsible.
 The editor-in-chief  of the newspaper...
 that published his past  gets killed.

 ( OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING )
Hello?
You're not carrying the present I gave you?
Virginia, where is it?
I should have guessed when I saw your boys downstairs.
No, no, my boys are not downstairs.
Virginia.
You have so many agencies following you...
that it's impossible to park on your street.
I'm used to men following me.
You are seeing someone else?
Don't forget that I listen to your conversations.
You do?
Then you've heard the threats?
Since you started killing ministers...
people keep calling me.
They turn on chainsaws.
They play funeral marches for me.
What happened to the minister was entirely his fault...
but what is going to happen to this county now...
is the government's fault. It's not my fault.
Now the gringos want to extradite me after Lara...
so we have to stop that treaty, no matter what.
Those of us who are in the position to be extradited...
we are going to send a message to the government...
and to the judges and to the journalists.
It's gonna be fine. It's going to be fine.
Pablo, you are losing your mind.
Why?
You don't listen to anyone.
You think you can take on everyone just by yourself.
You're headed straight for suicide.
And you are coming with me?
You'll be my biographer, remember.
The one who will tell the story.
To who? There won't be anyone left to hear it.
No.
This is the right address, isn't it? Check it.
No, no. I don't have to check anything, please.
We have this list, right?
Yes, but I can't let you in.
No, too bad. But when I'm given an order, I follow it.
No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Take that away.
You've got the wrong house.
Judge Carlos Alberto Alarcón?
That's me.
This is for you. It's from Don Pablo Escobar Gaviria.
[COURIER] Sir? Sir?
What's wrong? Oh, my God, help him.
For the love of God, help him.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) Pablo turns  threatening people...
 into its own genre.
Help him. Go quickly. Oh, my God, sir.
No, no, no, no.
Only one thousand million pesos, only. They are insulting us.
Sons of bitches.
No, no, no, no. This is what we'll do.
Hand out guns in the slums.
The more the better, 2,000 guns, 3,000 guns. I don't care.
 ( MUSIC PLAYING )
God bless the Patrón!
God bless the Patrón!
For every dead cop, I will pay $2,000.
And for every sergeant, I will pay $5,000.
[PABLO] For every lieutenant, I will pay $10,000...
for every captain, $20,000...
for every major, $50,000.
To get paid, it's very easy.
They have to bring the badge of the man they killed.
Did you hear?
 ( PHONE RINGS )  MAN (OVER PHONE) Listen, we
 are going to kill you, bitch.
 We're going to dismember that  little face, lazy bum.
 We're going to take it off,  bitch. Too much television.
 The law quickly sets its  exchange rate in the slums.
 ( MUSIC CONTINUES )
Get it, get it. Commander, put him in! Put him in!
Enough, enough, enough, enough!
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) Ten executions  for each dead police officer.
 They see every teenage boy  as a future sicario.
I'm not asking you. I'm ordering you.
I am giving you 24 hours to do what I say...
or I will kill your mother.
I will kill your father.
I will kill your grandmother.
 Soon all of those dead...
 whether killed by Pablo or his  enemies will haunt me as well.
Kill, commando, kill!
Kill, because God forgives!
The colombian government  creates a special 
unit exclusively  for my boyfriend.
Get to zero! What you see...
...fighting, waiting for Lucifer.
There are 500 men here, all from Bogotá...
devoted only to capturing Pablo Escobar.
We can take anyone from here.
We even bring in our own food, so they won't poison us.
What makes the DEA think we need you here?
The Extradition Treaty isn't working, is it?
So if you don't send them up to us, we come down and get them.
Nice.
Using three receivers on land...
we can precisely calculate the signal in a 200-yard radius.
If one of the posts detects relevant information...
it activates the protocol.
Hit the switch.
You will hear a sound cue which will inform your officer...
that the recording is in progress.
Sir!
Escobar! He is in Sector 2, La Victoria.
It's a mobile line, sir.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) The DEA set up sophisticated...
 tracking systems to pinpoint  Pablo.
Escobar! He is having lunch at El Dorado.
It's a public phone, sir. Sector seven, La Estrella.
That's on the other side of the city.
Escobar.
Escobar, next to the bull plaza, sir.
Sector 16, coming out of a--
Is he everywhere?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) They didn't  take into account...
 the paisa astuteness.
 I saw Pablo with a girl around  the corner. On Bolivar Avenue.
 Over here, sir. Near here  at Seventh and Independencia.
 Escobar, he's in Sector 2,  La Victoria.
 It's a mobile line, sir.
 On Bolivar Avenue.  He has dark glasses.
 Sector 9, outside of the  cooperative.
Nothing lasts forever, Virginia.
You know we have new partners and they have requested changes.
And your replacement, well, she has the right people behind her.
Who she fucks is not the problem. It's who I fuck.
Don't turn this around, Virginia.
We don't care what you do in your personal life here.
They told you to fire me.
Nobody told me to do anything. It's an artistic decision.
Replacing me with that cheap whore is an artistic decision?
Since when? Say it.
Just say it. This is because of him.
Say it. Say it!
We don't care what that gentleman lover...
of yours does for a living.
No?
You might care from now on, you motherfucker.
Trash.
And you better watch out, because I'm gonna tell Pablo...
to blow up your fucking building with you and your family inside.
Son of a bitch.
And that's gonna be an artistic decision, too.
What's wrong with men?
Nobody ever told you that if you want to see a woman...
you're supposed to call first?
Don't show me your badge. I accept.
It was good news then, hmm?
Great news. TV networks are like men.
Sometimes you have to leave them to be appreciated.
So, um, what's your plan?
I have an offer from a network in Florida. I might take it.
Start a new life.
But I would need a man there.
Are you still married, Agent Shepard?
Until you've made love to a Colombian woman...
that changes everything.
Please don't put my life in danger, Virginia.
Pablo doesn't need an excuse to kill a DEA agent.
He'll take you with him when he goes down.
You know that, don't you?
Virginia, you were fired by the network...
and you don't have any offers, no one will hire you.
Not here, not in Miami, nowhere. You're marked for life.
So you're gonna have to find something else to do.
Anything.
And you're not 20 anymore.
Your legs aren't as pretty as they used to be.
Or your smile.
What do you propose?
Help us.
In exchange for what?
Protection.
Protection... there is no such thing.
Pablo will find me, no matter where I go.
Do you think he doesn't scare me?
Do you think all the threats and death...
and smell of burnt flesh don't affect me?
Help us find him.
You know what?
The TV networks only want little girls now.
They don't value the experience of a woman.
Is that what Pablo values in you?
Exactly.
And my loyalty.
The bill has been paid.
Wait here.
 ( CAR ENGINE STARTS )
No, no, no, no. Listen to me.
Tell me, what does that gringo want?
 What all the gringos want,  Pablo. To catch you.
That son of a bitch, motherfucker.
-Is he staying in Medellin?   -Are you following me?
No, no. I'm not following you. And what if I'm following you?
Do you have something to hide, Virginia?
 Pablo, don't follow me and  don't call me anymore, okay?
You're ruining my life! You are ruining my life.
You know that I got fired because of you.
People keep avoiding me like the plague.
 Nobody will come near me.
Well, that gringo had no problem coming near you.
Stop talking about him and listen. Stay away from me!
I beg you! Stay away!
You're saying that because you know they are recording this...
and you want them to think it is over between us.
Ah! It is over between us! Hear it! It is over!
If anyone's out there listening, please record this.
I have nothing to do with the psychopathic killer...
on the other side of the line.
Listen, I'll-- I'll call you back. I'll call you back.
Ah!
Stubborn bitch.
Do you like birds?
Hmm? Yes. They represent freedom.
Pablo's lovers. Teenage
 girls from poor neighborhoods  handed over...
 by their families  for a few thousand pesos.
It isn't easy sleeping with the most wanted man in Colombia...
 and keeping it a secret.
 Believe me, I know.
 It just takes one of them  to talk...
 to have the Search Bloc  find him.

our people in Miami are getting out of line.
The routes are falling apart.
And the Cali Cartel is getting our territory.
We can't finance this war, if the business stops working!
Do you understand?
No, no, no, no, no. Son of a bitch, man!
I don't want you to kill them. They're our link up there.
I just want you to find Pablo...
is that so difficult to understand? Do you--
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) Monje's death  meant the fall...
of the cartel's financial wing.
 Garza's death meant the fall  of the toughest wing.

 Pablo loses his strong men.
 From this point on,  he can only run.
 PABLO (OVER PHONE)  For years we have called for
peace, but the only response...
 we've gotten has been official  and systematic persecution...
 ...against our families and  organizations.
 That's why I declare full out  war on the government...
 and the political  establishment.
 If they make me run,  I'll make them run, too.
 Terrorism is the atomic bomb  of the poor.
 We are not using lead anymore.  No, no, no.
 From now on, we are using  dynamite. You got that?
And how do we know that you are really Pablo Escobar Gaviria...
and not someone else pretending to be him?
 PABLO (OVER PHONE)  That's very easy.
I'll prove it to you by killing you and your family tonight...
 and blowing up your radio  station.
 Eh, what do you think?  Will that be enough? Hey!
You're a celebrity in your country, Virginia.
What's so appealing about coming to Miami to host a TV show?
Well, I don't really think...
I have anything else to prove in Colombia. No?
But, um, I guess what appeals to me is the-- the challenge.
It's the excitement of a-- of a new adventure.
Also, there are some very attractive men...
in this part of the world.
Tell us, Virginia, what's the last show...
you hosted on Columbian TV?
WOMAN (OVER SPEAKER) Welcome to  Miami International Airport.
 This is your final boarding  call...
 for Flight 87 to San Juan  now boarding--
How you doing? FBI.
Mind if we take a look at your passport?
Thank you.
You, uh, carrying any money?
My ex isn't using me as a mule yet.
Okay.
[WOMAN] Oh, my God!
What happened?
I'm sorry. They just closed Bogotá Airport.
Why?
I-- I'll call you back.
An Avianca plane exploded in mid flight.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  After the first bombs...
 the country asked the  government to give Pablo hell.
Oh, look at that little thing. This one is lovely.
 After a dozen bombs, the  country begs the government...
 to give Pablo what he wants.

107 people on board.
They just sent it.
Robin Newell and Catherine Gilmore.
35 and 32 years old, married.
Sir! Sir, wait!
Sir!
Ambassador. There were two Americans on the Avianca flight.
So listen. Directive 12.333 authorizes military
operations...
in foreign countries to guarantee...
the security of American citizens.
Thank you, Sarah. Agent Shepard, I'm sure you know Mr. Velarde.
He's also the man in charge of negotiating...
the surrender of Pablo Escobar.
This is Mr. Castro.
He is Mr. Escobar's legal representative.
He's agreed to turn himself in to the authorities.
In exchange for what?
 ( MUSIC PLAYING )
 By revoking the Extradition  Treaty...
our judges and magistrates have  taught the world a lesson...
 in sovereignty, independence  and patriotism.
 After years of persecution,  today the National Assembly...
 worked towards the defense of  human rights, peace--
Everything okay or what?
Sweep it well, dude. I'll see you later.
Pablo adds one last
 condition to his surrender.
 He provides the prison.
It is very pretty, isn't it?
 He cedes the property to the  municipalities...
 through a frontman... so they  can build it there.
Wow, look at that. Everyone is here but the president.
He couldn't make it... scheduling problems.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) Without the  threat of extradition...
 hanging over him, Pablo needs  a safe place...
 to reorganize his business.
For peace in Colombia.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  And the government...
 provides him with what?
The Conception and Norman Key routes are working again.
The Fany is at almost 100 percent.
We have 250 planes in service...
and 30 Pipers still immobilized in Santamarca. Yes.
Are you talking to the number two at the Aviation Authority?
Talk to him, he's your brother.
If he doesn't play ball, bring him here and I'll talk to him.
Ready, boss.
I request for everyone who is still outside...
nobody moves a gram without me knowing it...
nobody, that's the deal.
And they have to pay the taxes that they owe me.
It's 20 percent.
20 percent?
20 percent.
They won't like that, Pablo.
The Cali people are asking for five percent.
Everyone will go to them and think that's okay.
How do you know that? Have you talked to them?
'Cause that's easy to know? Maybe I spotted them.
Oh, no, no, no, amigo, amigo.
Now you prefer those pussies from Cali...
go to them and try your luck.
I came up with the routes, I took out extradition...
all by myself, so you can keep working.
Make everybody know that the one who doesn't pay with cash...
merchandise or properties, will pay with his life.
Do you hear me? You heard me, right?
Ready.
Yes, sir.

Why don't you live at home with us, Daddy?
Because I work here, Princess. You're my princess.
This is my castle. I-- do you see those towers there?
Those are my towers.
I am a king, and king has castles.
And that's why are you are a princess...
because you're my daughter.
But there are guards.
Of course there are. They're here to protect me.
Mommy says you can't leave, and she cries all the time.
What do you mean, I can't leave? Who says that?
Mommy.
No, no, no, no, my love, no. This is my castle.
I can come and go as I please.
You wanna see that?
You want to go out for an ice cream?
Where is the place that-- the big park near the church?
That's the one you like.

Open it.

What flavor do you want?
-Strawberry! -Strawberry!
The princess has a craving. Oh, look. That's good.
So don't you try to stop us...
or the king will cut your heads off.
Open the door. Open the door.
Look!
Our carriage is waiting for us.
That's good.
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.
The king is asking for the keys to the carriage.
Give me the keys. Give me the keys, old man.
Don't move! Don't move! Stop!
Pablo!
Pablo!
I forgot to tell you, my princess...
I made them bring the best ice cream...
strawberry ice cream of the world here for you.
Strawberry ice cream just made with ice from the North Pole...
which is especially for my daughter...
my princess especially.
The best one in the world, for you.
[DAUGHTER] Really?
[PABLO] Yes... have you heard of the strawberry
icebergs from the North Pole?
[PABLO] They're very famous.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) Not only  has the media banned me...
 my advertising contracts  are also cancelled...
which forces me to sell my home  to pay my debts.
Be careful with that.
What you just moved with your foot...
is a very expensive piece of Indonesian art.
I'm not asking you to use your head.
Using your hands will be enough.
 I rent an apartment  at El Nogal...
 where a former First Lady  lives...
hoping her bodyguards will keep  an eye on me, as well.
How are you, boys?
Fine, thanks.
 And I get a break from the  telephone threats.
All set, ma'am.

Wasn't it a new number?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  But not for long.

Good Lord!
Oh, hi.
Nice hotel.
How's your book going?
What book?
Who would want to read a book about you?
All my admirers.
Your admirers can't read. They are too young.
That's true. That's one of their virtues.
You know that I left a meeting to see you, so what do you want?
Tell me.
I need to know if I'm safe.
Aye, how would I know that? No one is safe in this country.
As far as you're concerned, can I feel safe?
Ah, no. Nobody will kill their own biographer.
No, don't worry. Relax.
What else?
Pablo, you can't imagine how terrifying my life has become.
My phone won't stop ringing. Threats every day, threats.
You have an army of men to protect you...
but who protects me?
What about me?
What can I do?
I need you to tell everyone we are not together anymore.
You're breaking my heart.
After all that I've done for you.
What have you done for me? Nothing.
I already a career when I met you. Don't forget that.
And I'm the only woman who has loved you...
without expecting anything in return...
and that includes your wife.
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't you ever dare to compare to my wife.
Don't even put the name of Victoria on your lips.
She was with me when I didn't have a peso.
Would you have noticed me back then, eh...
with no planes and no trips and no shopping in New York?
Would you have? No, tell me, would you?
I don't think so.
I'm broke, Pablo, I'm broke.
My career is over because of you.
Nobody will hire me anymore because of you.
So you need to help me.
How? What do you need? Tell me.
What do you need, Virginia?
$80,000 to go to Europe.
$80,000, that's a lot of money.
Please, $80,000.
I don't have no money.
No, I don't.
And you are my biographer. You have to stay here.
I've seen things, Pablo.
I've seen things while I was with you.
You've seen what?
Things that implicate a lot of people.
If I wanted to talk--
If you what?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I never expected this from you. Really?
No, for the love of God.
That's not what I mean. Pablo, I would never betray you.
It's just that I'm desperate.
I don't even know what I'm saying anymore.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Oh, come here. Give me a hug.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, I will take care of you...
and protect you and make sure you have a long life.
But you know what?
I have bad news for you.
Nobody will go near you...
because they will be afraid that I will kill them.
So your life is going to be full of shit.
Bitch!
 ( MUSIC PLAYING )
Pablo, the police are getting rough out there, my good man.
Business-- business isn't good.
No, they're not good. Ave Maria.
Just one question.
One question.
The Fany route moves, what, ten kilos a month?
Yeah.
And you paid me what, 50,000? 50,000.
Yes, but look, Pablo.
The Fany route failed twice this month.
We lost two 600 kilo shipments.
We have to pay the owners, hire lawyers for the pilots.
Yes, yes, but the deal was 250.
No, I gave you that route, remember?
Listen to me, man.
250 is impossible, Pablo. It's impossible, I mean it.
Trust us. We are your partners, son of a bitch.
We've been together from the start.
Trust us, Pablo.
Well, we're not in this together.
I'm here and you're out.
Yeah. We-- we know that, Pablo.
Who do you think we are?
But you have to pay me the tax, no?
You have to.
Either you pay it or I double it right now.
We have to discuss it with the other families.
Look, Pablo, business has changed a lot.
Things aren't the same they used to be anymore.
50,000 should be enough.
That's that.
Mm.
50,000 should be enough.
That's that.
So you come here to sit down in front of me...
with that gold and those fancy clothes.
You are all getting rich out there, while I am here.
No, Pablo.
And then you are flirting with the Cali people...
and to top it off, you don't want even to pay me.
Pablo, Pablo, Pablo, what's wrong?
No, Pablo, it's not that.
What are you going to do, man? Have you gone crazy?
 ( MUSIC BLARING )
Let me go! Let me go!
Let me go!
No, no! Don't complain.
Don't complain. You are already dead.
This is just a formality. Go ahead.
Pablo! Don't kill me like this.
Don't be pussies!
Just shoot me!
This way your families can put the pieces back together.
Be grateful, motherfuckers!
Show me his arm.  VIRGINIA (V.O.) The murders
 at La Catedral reached...
 the media and made the  government an accomplice.
 It's credibility is at stake.  They decide to transfer Pablo
 to a military prison.

 The fence of the prison  was electric...
 but the switch was  in Pablo's room.

Apparently they are thinking...
"If he did that Santoro and Hermosilla...
"what will he do to us?"
Sons of bitches.
They're running like chicken straight to Cali.
What, do you think that was a mistake?
 VIRGINIA (V.O.)  Sure it was.
Pablo's ex-associates cooperate  with the government...
 in exchange for having their  records cleared.
 Dozens of narcos willing to  fight him are released.
To the airport.
Son, say goodbye.
This is not a country, it's a mass grave.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Who are you?
What the fuck do you want?
 Pablo's enemies, members of  rival cartels...
 and paramilitary groups,  together with government...
 security forces supported  by the DEA and the CIA...
 form the most lethal hunting  party of all time.
For working with Pablo Escobar.
 The bodies of Pablo's lawyers,  hitmen, accountants...
 and family appear scattered  all over Medellín.
 ( DRAMATIC MUSIC CONTINUES )
What happened? Did they kill someone? Who was it?
 Anyone who's ever been close  to him becomes a target.
Good morning, can I help you?
Good morning.
These belonged to European royalty.
And these earrings, if you give me a good price...
I'll bring you more.
All right. Let me have a look.
Exquisite.
Don't open the door.
Do you know him?
No.
Call the police. Call the police.
 ( CALL BOX BUZZING )
Call the police! Call them!
-I'm sorry. -No!
What are you doing? Let me in!
I don't want to get in trouble. Sorry.
Let me in! Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!
Let me in! Let me in!
No! No! No! No!
 ( CAR ENGINE STARTING )
 ( SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING )
I'm going to be star.
Look.
Victoria, did you hear that?
Manuela's going to be a star in the Christmas show.
Will you come and see me?
Yes, I will.
Mom made me a shiny costume.
I'm sure you're beautiful in it.
Victoria... what happened?
Don't cry. Don't cry.
She won't be in the show.
What? Why.
The parents of the other children objected.
They held an assembly.
She doesn't know yet.
Why?
Why?
Because they're afraid your enemies will blow up...
the school, Pablo, that's why.
They are scared.
Son of a bitch. Motherfucking sons of bitches.
Give me your hand.
I need you to take the kids...
and get on a plane and get out of this country.
It is getting very dangerous for you here.
You can't stay here. You can't.
So once you leave, I can take care of things.
You didn't keep your promise, Pablo.
You promised me everything will be fine.
I know.
That my children would have a normal life.
Does this seem like a normal life to you?
( DOOR CLOSES )
There's a woman out here. She wants to talk to you.
What's her name?
I don't know. She got mad at me when I asked.
Says she's famous around here.
He needs to get his family out of the country.
They cannot stay here.
They would reach them in America...
so they have to go to Europe.
And as soon as they're out, he'll feel free...
to destroy everything, so you cannot let them leave.
As long as they are here, he'll be busy trying to protect them.
You better trust me. You can't let them leave.
This is his weak spot, his family. His family. His family.
It's all he cares about. Nothing else.
And you know that first hand, don't you?
Oh, you have no idea.
We can't do that.
The Attorney General is the one getting them out of the country.
They made a deal.
Once they're out, Pablo Escobar will turn himself in.
Break your word.
Just put some pressure on the German chancellor.
They land in Cologne in two hours.
Do not let them get off that plane.
There's no legal reason they can't travel to Germany.
Bring them back. The family is bait.
We need them alive and at home.
Put them someplace, and we sit and we wait.
Pablo will try to talk to them, right?
When that happens, we'll be ready.
 Pablo Escobar Gaviria's family  was greeted...
 by a strong security presence  upon arrival in Bogota...
BREAKING NEWS
this morning after being denied  entry into Germany.
 The wife and the two children  of the couple were forced...
 to spend the night in the  Cologne airport...
and later sent back to Colombia  on a regular--
Puta, they have taken my family hostage.
Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches.
 The German government has  denied petition...
 that the family requested upon  arrival.
 The Army has cordoned off the  apartment building...
 where they are staying.
 The operation has been joined  by men...
 from the Fiscalia and the  Search Bloc.
 The enormous security presence  has been established--
Juan Pablo, please. Turn it off.
 Escobar's wife and two  children--
Do you need anything else?
No, thank you.
Juan Pablo!
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Should've asked if anyone wanted anything.
No, I'm okay, thanks.
 ( PHONE RINGS )
Hello?
Call.
 [PABLO] Victoria, what  happened?  Are you okay?
 Is everyone okay?
 [VICTORIA] They treated us  well now. Don't worry.
 You have to be careful, okay?
How are they? How are they? How are you? How is Manuela?
 [PABLO] How is Manuela?
She's okay, my love. She's okay.
You're all we think about, Pablo.
We miss you so much.
Can you come and go? Are they protecting you?
Are they-- are they holding you hostage?
 [VICTORIA]  There's an Army outside.
Puppy Dog, do you read?
 The man is on the phone.  La America sector...
 I repeat: La America sector.
 [AGENT]  We are on our way, sir.
Ask the Attorney General to release you.
Yes, Attorney General.
Because only I take care of my family, nobody else.
 Nobody else.
Okay? Hello?
 Hello?
Anybody listening?
 [PABLO] Hello? Hello?
Two minutes, Patrón.
Aye yi yi yi yi.
I know that you are all there listening.
Yes, hiding like a bunch of fucking pussies.
The colonel and his Bloc trash, and all of you.
Gringos, sons of bitches, motherfuckers.
And the CIA and that motherfucker from the DEA.
I already spared your life once, I won't spare it again.
Yo, yo, now listen to me... everyone.
I'm -- I'm going to kill you... and your children and your
wives.
And I'm saving a special bullet to put right in front...
of your fucking skull...
and you're going to bleed until you die.
Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches.
Don't call here anymore, mister. This place is full of cops.
Victoria, don't tell me what to do.
No, no, no, no. Don't tell me what to do.
Do what I ask you. Yes. Keep Manuela nearby.
Bastards!
Sons of bitches. Motherfuckers.
Stay calm.
Motherfuckers.
Check. Check.
Hold on.
 VIRGINIA (V.O.) The previous moment to something happening..
 is always the best moment.
 Like when you are waiting for  the man you love...
 or when you are about to open  a present.
The fishermen from the coast of  Colombia...
 say that what really matters  is the wait.
 Feeling the sea breeze on your  face, the salt on your lips.
 Imagining that little fish  fucker approaching the bait.
 He wants to bite it, but he  thinks it over.
 But if the bait is good  enough...
 the fish will eventually  bite it.
 Even when he knows there  is a hook inside.
 He'll bite.
 ( CALL RINGING )
Call!
Daddy?
Aye, Manuela.
How is the most beautiful star in the sky?
Mommy says I can't be in the show.
Mama is wrong.
Mama is saying that because she wants it to be a surprise.
Don't tell her I told you that.
I'm getting a signal.
Somewhere in Los Olivos between 80th and 90th.
Los Olivos, 80th and 90th.
 To Los Olivos! To Los Olivos!
And you have your dress ready?
 [MANUELA]  It's so shiny, Daddy.
Beautiful.
 Everything--
Everything is going to be much,  much better from now on.
You will see. My love, you will see.
Correction. 70 and 80.
 ( SPEAKING SPANISH ) 
Will you come and see me?
Yes, I will, of course.
 Will they let you?
They? They will. Of course they will.
You know why?
Because you're the king?
Yes, I am the king.
 ( DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING )
 AGENT (OVER RADIO)  72 and 80th!
 74th and 80! 74 and 80th.
 He's to my left.
Fifty meters. Turn here.
 ( TRACKER DEVICE BEEPING )
My love, put Juan Pablo on.
I just saw him.
-We got him. -Inform the President.
My love.
Dad.
Patrón, two minutes.
No, son, you now are the man of the house.
Now you have to take care of your mother and Manuela.
Do you understand? Huh? Do you understand?
Okay.
Okay, I have some notes for you to tell the press.
-Go ahead. -Write it down. Write it down.
Okay, the Attorney General agreed on getting you out...
of the country, but didn't do it because they gave...
into the pressure of my enemies in Colombia and out of Colombia.
Yes.
Tell them that Pablo Escobar agreed on turning himself...
in the moment his family was safe...
but they didn't keep their side of the deal.
Move in.
And now they will have to pay the consequences.
Move in!
Whatever happens from now on is going to be their fault.
Okay? Repeat what I said back to me, Juan Pablo.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not what I said, Juan Pablo.
That's not what I said.
I said that they are responsible for all of this...
and that they have to face the consequences now.
Do you understand?
Okay, Dad. I'm going to hang up.
Pablo, please.
Say it. Listen! You have to learn this.
If you-- if-- if you can't get people to like you...
then you have to make them respect you.
And if they don't respect you, then make them fear you.
Understand? Understand?
 Make them fear you.
Do you hear that?
( LOUD THUD )
Hold on.
 Dad?
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!
Long live Colombia!
( GUN FIRES ) Mom!
Long live Colombia!
 A last minute wire confirms  that Pablo Escobar Gaviria...
 the ex-boss of the Medellín  Cartel...
 has been gunned down today by  members of the Search Bloc...
 in a residential neighborhood  of Medellín.
Along with Escobar, police also  killed Carlos...
Virginia, you ready?
I'll wait for you outside.
Do you still love him?
I love Pablo.
I hate Escobar.
Would you be willing to testify before a federal judge?
He asked me to tell his story.
