What happened?
The lights went out.
Why?
This is normal.
The lights are out all over the world.
The lights are out all over Egypt.
Everything is like this
it's not just the electricity.
Electricity is the least
of our problems.
And all the little kids in the streets say,
"Turn the lights back on man. "
Who is the "man"?
The man who's responsible for
switching the electricity back on.
The regime.
- Are you recording?
- Yes
- Really recording?
- Yes
Ok. Do as you like.
Let me tell you how this whole story began.
Egypt was living without dignity.
Injustice existed everywhere.
Before the revolution I lived
from one job to the next.
I started working when I was 8 years old.
In fifth grade, I used
to pay my school tuition
By selling lemons in the street.
There was no hope for a
better future in this country.
We were tied down by
an unjust regime and its dictator.
Mubarak was the head of the regime
That forced us to live for 30 years
under emergency law.
I lived my entire life
under Mubarak's injustice.
The regime always worked against the people.
They would torture, electrocute,
beat the shit out of people.
No one dared to speak about politics.
Politics was for the regime only.
Oh my God people.
"KHALED SAEED, VICTIM OF TORTURE"
We want to go to Tahrir Square
If we have any dignity and want
to live as humans in this country
Then we have to go to the streets.
We will go down and demand our
fundamental human rights.
I am going down and I will say
"No" to corruption. "No" to this regime.
I went to the streets.
I found everyone around me
Felt just as I did.
The people want to end corruption.
Peaceful
The police tried to divide us
with all they had.
People got angry
And broke their fears.
I'm not afraid for myself.
I'm afraid for you.
And for what the future holds.
Everyone is in the streets.
Come down for God's sake.
Tell those who have been sleeping in shit.
For the sake of your kids and family,
so you can live.
Go ahead Sir.
I would like to address
Egypt's youth
in Tahrir Square.
I speak to all of you
from the heart,
Like a father
to his sons and daughters.
I take pride in you
As a symbol
of a new Egyptian generation
Determined to achieve changes.
Egypt is facing difficult times.
I'm afraid for the outcome
of this situation
And that the youth
who are calling for change
Will be the first
to suffer the consequences.
We have taken Tahrir Square!
The people demand the fall of the regime.
The entire nation erupted at once
To battle injustice, corruption,
poverty, ignorance
All that we endured
over the past 30 years.
We were all equal.
Reflections of each other.
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom
I swore to God
That I wouldn't leave the Square
Until our demands were met.
I met Magdy Ashour in the Square.
Magdy is a member of
the Muslim Brotherhood.
Your bullets won't hurt us.
Khalid Abdalla
An Egyptian who was born abroad
but came back to Egypt never to leave.
Aida
Freedom is for everyone.
Ramy Essam
He became known
as the singer of the revolution.
Bread, freedom, social justice.
I swear I'm staying here with you.
We found ourselves loving
each other without realizing it.
Hey guys!
We going home?
Hell No!
We going home?
Hell No!
Then it's a sit-in
Sit-in
Until Mubarak leaves
There was no such thing
as Muslim or Christian.
We were all present.
We were one hand.
One hand!
One hand!
One hand!
We will fill the world with our poetry.
Our words will stand in the Square.
And they will be like bullets in this war.
Revolution until victory!
Revolution on ecery street in Egypt!
Leave Mubarak!
This is when we realized that
people are the true power.
Every 5 seconds,
thousands join the sit-in.
We won't leave the Square
until our demands are met.
We've never had our rights.
Finally we have this piece of land
to call our own
And to claim our rights on.
And now, it's ours.
It's not too much to ask for.
Tahrir Square is nothing
Compared to the thousands
of acres they stole.
Tea anyone?
Tea anyone?
I told you we'd have
some tea together.
You too have some tea.
If I were to talk on behalf
of some of the Islamists
Who's to say who's
an example of Islam?
The ideas we've adopted since
the start of the revolution are beautiful
The idea that we're one society.
To imagine that one day I would
be standing in Tahrir Square
In solidarity with all these people
I could never have imagined it.
God be with you.
I am telling you
good things are coming.
Good things.
Thank God.
Down with Mubarak!
Down with Mubarak!
Down with Mubarak!
President Mohammed
Hosni Mubarak
Has decided to give up
his position as President,
Entrusting the Armed Forces
With the management
of the nation.
We all understand
The magnitude of his decision.
The Supreme Council
of the Armed Forces
Wholeheartedly salutes
The revolutionaries who
lost their lives.
He stepped down!
He stepped down!
Oh my God!
Oh Egypt!
Tahrir Square changed Egypt completely.
It moved the whole world.
For the first time in our lives, we
couldn't be silenced.
We reclaimed our freedom.
And we dreamed that one day
All of Egypt would be like Tahrir Square.
Revolution
Everyone,
clap your hands.
Let's celebrate
We're all one hand
And our demands are one
A country by the people
By the people
By the people
By the people
The mood here
is absolutely extraordinary.
I think the really
interesting thing here
For me, is the fact
that Mubarak's leaving
Is not enough for the people.
My homeland, my homeland, my homeland
You have my love and my heart.
The most beautiful thing
about this revolution
Is that we were all united.
We forgot our political differences
and came together.
Soon people will realize that they
misunderstood the Muslim Brotherhood.
Usually the Muslim Brotherhood
is our biggest fear.
But everyone inside the
Square now is different.
We are doing this
for our children.
Even if I die, it's for the future.
So now that Mubarak is gone,
we have to take control.
The main thing
is taking the regime down.
Whoever is negotiating
with them
The regime is already down.
If you take out people
and put people just like them
From the same circle,
from the same regime
Then you didn't take down the regime.
You took down the people.
No one is going to kill you.
I told you before
The Army will sacrifice
their last drop of blood
Before they fire a
single bullet on the people.
Never.
Now please pack your things
and go home.
When Mubarak stepped down
The Armed Forces took
over the country's affairs.
They swore to God to meet
the people's demands.
So people went home.
And nothing happened.
We didn't put the killers on trial
or change the government.
There is no new constitution,
and the Secret Police are still in power.
The regime is not just Mubarak.
The regime is all
the country's institutions,
and they all have to change.
So we went back to the Square.
We're entering Tahrir Square,
the place of pride and dignity
Where a tent and a blanket
can solve all your problems.
We'll keep protesting.
We'll keep protesting.
We're staying here.
We're not going anywhere.
We're staying here.
We're not going anywhere.
We'll continue our revolution.
We'll continue our revolution.
Our revolution is
a people's revolution
Our revolution is
a people's revolution
Not a coalition's recolution
Nor a party's revolution.
Not a coalition's recolution,
nor a party's revolution.
For the past 3 or 4 days people
would come and threaten us.
They asked why we are here.
We tried to explain to them
The biggest mistake we made
Was that we left the Square
before the power was in our hands.
It takes time to convince people to join us.
One person joins
Then two and three.
I find myself giving a speech to
40 or 50 people every two hours.
I speak my heart out.
People start to understand.
Out of 40 or 50 people,
20 agree with me.
And the numbers keep
getting bigger.
It makes me so happy.
Oh my God, look how big that pepper is.
Look how big the pepper is,
now that the age of Mubarak is over.
During his rule,
the peppers were tiny.
Look how big they are now.
There is hope for the future.
I don't think I look like a thug.
You look like a lovely person
And you're talking decently.
We just need your I.D.
- There is still a revolution.
- I know.
- And there's a sit-in.
- Okay.
And problems happen inside.
And you are being searched
by Ramy Essam,
The handsome singer
of our revolution.
It's a great honor.
I hope it's you every day.
Tell me, what time do you come?
We'll wait for you.
Every day at 8 am and 4 pm.
I look forward to it.
Oh man, this is hard.
Security takes skill.
This is Egypt State Radio.
I'm a General and Military Analyst.
No, the title of expert
is a very big thing.
If people have demands, they should
submit them to authorities
And assign representatives.
And they have
the media to complain to.
If we and the government
don't succeed,
Then they have the right to criticize.
Protests gather people from
all walks of life.
Was everyone in Tahrir a protester?
Some had nothing to do
with the protest.
Some went to Tahrir
to look like heroes.
Today, anyone can pretend that they
were heroes of the revolution
You were in the Square.
You know the type
Some people went to get stoned,
or to steal, or some were thugs.
There are three powers:
the secular somehow,
The Islamist, and the old regime
led by the Army.
The Army has won
part of this revolution.
They wanted to stop Mubarak's
son from inheriting power.
Once that happened, they wanted
people to go back home,
And the country to go back
to its corrupt ways.
The Army are the leaders
of the counter-revolution.
You've already won a lot,
and it is threatened.
This is a warning.
Leave! Go home.
If you don't leave,
I will shoot you.
Egyptians do not revolt easily.
For us to revolt,
it means we've had enough.
Enough!
We'll free our country,
no matter what.
And we'll take down the regime.
The people are determined
to continue their revolution.
Do whatever you want to us
We're staying,
this is our Square.
The people are the source
of authority, not the Army.
You are saying that
it's a peaceful protest.
You think you can do
whatever you want
And we won't attack you.
But we will attack if necessary.
That's how it is.
That's the end of it.
You're imposing a curfew?
Yes, God willing.
You mean just in the Square?
No, everywhere.
But, Sir
Mister, I'm afraid this won't do.
But they told us yesterday,
We could continue
the sit-in in the Square.
- Off you go. Leave.
- Yes, sir.
Why the Square in particular?
We took these barricades
from the Police,
So we'd be able to stop any attack.
We do trust the Army.
But there are some
leaders in the Army
Who are corrupt because
they are part of Mubarak's era.
Everyone's awake.
There might be an attack at any time.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
Guys, the Police and the
Army are standing together.
Why do you have a camera?
I'm a reporter
Come here, I want to talk to you.
- No
- I won't arrest you, I swear
No, I'm sorry
Calm down
Let him go! Let him go!
Don't arrest him!
Ok, ok. I'm coming with you.
Pull down the barricade.
So this is our Army!
Look at what they are doing!
Don't talk shit about the Army!
I can't believe this is happening!
We need to go back!
Just stop it!
They can't get away
with this shit!
Fine.
Go back.
We left people behind.
Can we speak inside, please?
Has anyone been killed?
There's no news.
Tahrir is symbolic land.
If you've got control of it,
you have power.
It pulls people to you.
It wasn't on BBC. It wasn't on CNN.
It was nowhere.
Ramy Essam?
Can you call?
Tell me the exact names
Ramy Essam, the singer.
Do you know Ramy Essam?
They arrest people and
take them to the museum.
Be sure of it
before you spread the word.
Ramy was taken?
He got arrested.
A lot of people got arrested.
They will fuck him up.
How can they fucking do this?
They threw me to the ground
and took my clothes off.
And they cut my hair.
They beat me in lots of different ways.
We have seen terrible injustice from them.
This is from electrocution.
The blood freezes and clogs.
Every two weeks, the Secret Police
used to come and take me away.
I didn't know if I would ever return.
Many of my friends died inside.
They used to come in
the middle of the night.
They used to take you away violently.
You were afraid to dream the wrong dream
for fear of punishment.
They used to search his computer
Looking for anything religious or Islamic.
They used to come, and
no one could say a word.
He was electrocuted and beaten.
The battle isn't just the rocks and stones
The battle is in the images
The battle is in the stories.
We decided to create
a space which supports
Those fighting for the revolution
Through video and various
types of media.
It's what's called "Popular Media"
Using web sites like YouTube.
If you know anyone who
has a digital camera
They're not using, tell us.
We should film as much as we can.
The truth is that things
are moving quickly.
We don't know when this footage
can be used as evidence.
If people are being fooled about
what is really happening here,
We must film everything
and show them the truth.
As long as there's a camera,
the revolution will continue.
The problem now with the media
Is that they oppose change
And turn people against the revolution.
So what will you do?
Well, I am going
to keep exposing them.
And they'll keep
exposing themselves.
Until
The corrupt media falls.
What are you going to do?
Start a television station?
Yes, hopefully I will.
Well you'll have to put it in Cyprus
or else they will destroy it.
So you'll need
a massive amount of money.
Yours
Because your people are poor.
And who is this democracy
and freedom for?
The poor and under privileged.
The rich don't want freedom.
They're already free.
Revolution means total change.
A government
accountable to the people.
Be patient.
Patient for how long?
This is what I thought would
happen when we left the Square
After Mubarak stepped down,
We would run the government
And run the Army.
Look, our biggest mistake
was leaving the Square.
We're like someone who
did really well in an exam
And then forgot to write their
name on the exam.
So you have no idea
who it belongs to.
WE YOUR EGYPTIAN ARMED FORCES HAVE
NOTHING BUT LOVE AND APPRECIATION
FOR EGYPT'S BELOVED PEOPLE AND ITS
INNOCENT MARTYRS OF THE REVOLUTION
We have nothing against
nature, grass, or beauty
But this is not our Square.
This is the Square they're
using to manipulate us
In order for them to say
"We cleaned up the Square for you. "
"And beautified it for you"
"And did all what you wanted. "
Why do you want to ruin
what they did?
Move away.
They are trying to
divide us and distract us.
Egypt, mother of the world,
my country
Where laughter and singing comes
Purely from the heart.
Six months have passed since
the day we started the revolution
The Armed Forces said they would
hand over power in six months.
But what have they done instead?
They started arresting us day after day.
Sent thousands of revolutionaries
to military trials.
There is no new constitution.
There is no law.
Nothing to protect us.
So we defied Army orders
and took back our Square.
Wake up
Cicil
Peaceful
Popular
Totally Free!
Revolution
I'm Egyptian, and I'm
sitting-in once again in Tahrir
Because I didn't feel any change.
Why do they send the
revolutionaries to military trials
While the corrupt old regime
is protected?
The Square is what united us all.
Even if we disagree with each other,
We have to be united once again.
I'm Ahmed Hassan, your friend,
sitting-in with you in Tahrir Square.
During the early days, we agreed
to stay united no matter what.
When we were united
we brought down the dictator.
How do we succeed now?
We succeed by uniting once again.
All political currents, the Brotherhood,
Muslims and Christians
Any party,
we're all Egyptians.
We have to go back to being united.
God give you strength.
THE PEOPLE WANT TO CLEANSE THE NATION
- I missed you.
- I missed you a lot.
- How are you?
- Good
There's a massive turnout today.
- But it's a different crowd today.
- Meaning?
There's a big presence
of Muslim Brotherhood.
- More than the last week?
- For sure.
Yes, the Brotherhood wasn't here last week.
All the Muslim Brothers
were told to be here today.
It's been said that the Muslim
Brotherhood made a deal with the Army.
This is what's being said.
Honestly, I'm upset about their
political tactics and games.
They should not be here
for a political agenda or gains.
Some Brotherhood leaders make
secret deals with the Army
And use their presence in the Square
as a negotiating tool.
You know I think this is wrong.
The Quran is
our constitution.
Islamic rule!
Islamic rule!
The Muslim Brotherhood
started yelling "Islamic rule, Islamic rule"
What do they mean by Islamic?
Aren't we Muslims too?
The Brotherhood began to use the Square
to negotiate with the Army.
They're not calling
for the people's demands.
But for their political demands.
The Brotherhood ruined the sit-in.
They've created divisions
amongst everyone in the Square.
They are exhausting
everyone with their lies.
Thank you
- What are you going to eat?
- I have some.
When the Brotherhood are active, people say
they are hijacking the revolution.
But the Brotherhood existed
long before the revolution.
But you change your statements
based on where you are.
In Cairo, you say you a want secular state.
In other areas you say
you want a religious one.
You are the biggest supporters of the
Military Council, standing against us.
You speak in the name of
religion to get what you want.
You contradict your statements all the time.
Hold on, look at this
I'm very sorry that you
were beaten in the past.
No, not beaten.
We've spent our lives in prison cells.
The Muslim Brotherhood
has damaged the image of Islam.
I am embarrassed of being
a Muslim because of you.
The Brotherhood has hijacked the revolution,
turned people against us
And the media blames the revolutionaries
for destroying the country!
The people who died,
they died because of you,
And your deals with the Military.
Weren't the Brotherhood
with you in the Square?
Yes, there were some who died
next to me
But they were defying
Brotherhood orders.
Sir, if you forget,
the Egyptian people do not.
Don't try to hijack the revolution.
Fine, fine, fine
The entire Brotherhood is bullshit.
Sir, can I ask you a question?
Are the Brotherhood
leaving the Square?
Yes, they're leaving at 5
The Brotherhood refuse
to stay in the sit-in,
Because you're calling
for a new constitution.
Let's cut the bullshit.
We made a revolution,
we demand a new constitution.
Laws, elections, judiciary
Everything stems from the constitution.
Listen, the Brotherhood
will never make radical changes
Never the radical change we want.
I don't want to follow the
news of the sit-in anymore.
I'm not supporting
this sit-in anymore.
Especially when you say it's full of
Brotherhood and State Security.
No, it's not full of them.
But it's a place where it's easy
to manipulate things.
It's obvious that our presence in
the Square pressures the Army.
As long as you have a daily
commitment to the Square,
You will keep going
Until you get arrested.
I'm not happy with
the leaders of the Brotherhood.
I disagree
with their latest statements
That we can't go to the Square
because it's hurting the economy
And it could put the Brotherhood
in a bad position.
When our leaders issue an order,
we don't argue
Because we see them
as better judges.
- They say...
- Don't talk about it?
No, "You're there as an individual,
not as a Muslim Brother. "
They repeat this
message at each meeting.
Do you know what a 'civil state' is?
A 'civil state' represents
all different parts of society.
- Which mainly includes what?
- What?
The Islamic religion.
No matter what,
religion will always be there.
But it should be official.
Religion does not need to be on paper.
Religion is in the heart,
- And in the mind.
- It should also be on paper.
Paper, what paper?
You need a paper to
know you are Muslim?
When the Brotherhood got what
they wanted from the Military,
They left us alone in the Square,
to get beaten up, arrested
To die alone.
Why are you doing this?
You motherfucker!
Come back, come back!
Asshole.
Your permit.
Your permit.
Ok, where's your film?
No, you did.
Yeah, yeah.
Your ID.
Open the camera.
Show me the camera.
I want to see your ID.
Don't step outside.
Well, this is why we want to get
rid of them as soon as possible
And to say that people
are not ready to vote
Is just very condescending and wrong.
Yeah, I know you don't agree.
You want Parliamentary
elections in two months?
Yes, I want people to vote.
In two months?
Yes, yes.
Okay, so what?
Yet, people are complaining that
the Muslim Brotherhood will win.
Fuck this.
Between the ex-regime as a major power force
And the Brotherhood as a major power force
I believe that the millions
who made this happen,
I believe that the majority
of them were not people
Who wanted the old regime
And were not people who
wanted the Brotherhood.
I am so fucking scared of the moment,
a lieutenant or a brigadier general
Enough of this.
All the politicians are failures.
The Muslim Brothers, the Salafis,
the Socialists,
The Liberals, they're all failures.
I've decided to walk in
the middle of the street.
The cars can do whatever they want.
What can they do?
Run me over?
They need to curb to the side,
not me.
I will stand my ground.
Go away.
Enough walking cautiously
on the side.
After ten months,
everything was against us.
The Military Council was against us.
The Brotherhood sold us out.
The media made people hate us.
So much so that a peaceful protest
In front of the State Media building
Could go so wrong.
I never imagined this could happen.
Why do these people want to enter
the state television building?
Imagine if someone went in and
announced themselves President
Hell could break out.
Alright?
Those soldiers were on duty.
Right?
A soldier on duty,
what is he supposed to do?
Who started attacking first?
That's the question.
Please accept my condolences.
Don't cry.
Your son is in heaven.
We'll continue his fight.
We used to sit together in the Square.
He used to sing,
"Christians and Muslims are one. "
Nothing can ever separate us.
Thousands will fight for his rights.
Mina is in Heaven.
Our voices must be heard.
All bodies must be examined
and evidence must be kept!
We want our autopsy reports!
The hospital doesn't want to
stamp the autopsy reports.
We discovered that the Secret Police
infiltrated the hospital
Trying to convince the families
not to do autopsies.
We managed to kick them out
And the prosecutors left with them.
Now we're waiting for the
families to make a decision.
Whether they do the autopsies
or bury the bodies immediately.
Without the autopsy evidence,
there'll be a big problem.
They'll be able to say
"Oh, they died in a stampede. "
They have to do autopsies.
They have to be filmed.
Because there are clear marks
that they were run over by tanks.
They summarized all you wrote
And said he died from
a bullet in the chest.
Stay here.
I'll get you the report.
For a year we've been
in this mess.
In this shit, in this country
Because of every time
we keep silent.
We can't stay silent.
We have to keep the
pressure on.
We might not win this time,
but maybe next time.
People must know they will be punished
And be afraid of that.
People can't take it anymore.
They're losing their nerves.
The Egyptian regime was able
to fool both Muslims and Christians.
They want to suffocate us.
If it remains stuck in our minds
That it's a sectarian problem,
that will be a crisis.
The Army wants this to happen.
There is an old saying:
- "Divide and Conquer"
- Exactly.
They want to divide Muslims and Christians.
Why Mina? Didn't I tell you
not to go to protests?
"I won't go.
I'll do as you say, Mom. "
But you tricked me and went
And took your life away from me.
"If I died a martyr, Mom?
Would you be sad for me, Mom?"
I'm not sad for the martyr in you.
But losing you hurts, my love.
I'm not sad
for the martyr in you, my love.
I'm not sad
for the martyr in you, my love.
Our parting hurts, Mina.
Our Army is firing at us!
A new revolution all ocer again!
Live free or die heroes!
Our Army has protected you!
And protected the revolution!
The Army didn't protect
the revolution.
The Army protected
their interests
But betrayed the revolution!
Betrayed the revolution!
Protected the revolution!
Betrayed the revolution!
Betrayed the revolution!
The Army betrayed the revolution!
So you are right?
And all of us are wrong?
Betrayed the revolution!
It's shocking that however
many people died yesterday
The whole country isn't in outrage.
Is there still a possibility for enough
people to be convinced
That action en masse can change the
future of the country.
And if people are stopping to
believe that, then
As a revolution we're in trouble.
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
Freedom!
When you're working hard
And worried about your
country's future
When all your work
is for nothing
Because only the corrupt
get ahead
Bow, bow,
bow your head down
Because your country is a "democracy"
When freedom of expression
is a crime
When you have to hide
your beliefs in your heart
When I can see shame
in your eyes
Then join your pain with mine
Bow, bow,
bow your head down
Because your country is a "democracy"
When the Army
is your "protector"
While turning its back on the country
Abusing their powers
Hiding safely
behind their uniform
Bow, bow,
bow your head down
Because your country is a "democracy"
The people want the fall
of the Military regime
The people want the fall
of the Military regime
The people want the fall
of the Military regime
Khalid!
Get in the car.
Stand back. Stand back.
The Square was tough.
The Square was not normal.
No one could understand
what was happening.
It was a war.
A war in the Square.
Not a revolution.
It was not a revolution.
The people demand the fall
of the Military regime.
They were firing live bullets at us.
Firing randomly in every
corner of the Square.
People were falling one by one
Just because they were saying
"Down with Military rule. "
Revolutionaries
The good and free people
are being called traitors
While the traitors are called heroes.
It was too much.
Too many bullets.
Our Army is killing us.
They can't be Egyptians!
They forgot Egypt!
He's alive, he's alive
Death always knocks on my door
Knocking on my head.
The Brotherhood just called me.
They said "Don't go to the Square. "
I told them "No one is going
to stop me from following my conscience"
It is your right to banish me from
your group, from your party.
Banish me and my whole family,
But they have no authority over me.
The issue is over.
They know Magdy is always in the Square.
Magdy the revolutionary?
Not Magdy the Muslim Brother?
Yes, the revolutionary.
I want to tell the Brotherhood
that the protestors who are sacrificing now
Are the only reason
they have any voice in this country.
Elections or not, our revolution
is still not over.
Nothing has been accomplished yet.
There's only so much you can handle.
We're human after all.
There's only so much
you can see.
At some point I'm going to explode.
At some point, I'm going to explode.
Watch out, watch out!
Are you ok?
Hey kiddo,
are you ok?
Ahmed! Ahmed!
Let me pass, let me pass
Is it a bullet?
A bullet?
Is it a bullet?
Or a rock?
Can I have some bandages?
Bandages, bandages
Why is there all this blood?
Why all this blood?
They're gassing the hospital
and people are dying.
Even the doctors are dying.
I think it's nerve gas.
You collapse and convulse.
Did you film any of this?
I filmed but then I fell.
You couldn't take it?
I was shaking and suffocating.
Everyone was.
The patients have to be moved,
or they will die.
General Tantawi denied that
any live bullets have been fired.
Glorious people of Egypt.
What we are witnessing
now on the streets and television
Are just accusations attempting
to smear the image of the Military.
The Armed Forces will move forward
with Parliamentary elections as planned.
Presidential elections will take place
before the end of June 2012.
It's the first time he dares speak to us!
Hi Ahmed
How did you know it was me?
Of course honey, you're my sweetheart.
So quickly you said "Hello Ahmed. "
How are you doing?
I'm fine, thank God.
I prepared dinner for you.
Thank you.
I'll come home now.
Okay
Good-bye
I can't tell my mother I'm injured.
It will make her worry.
And while we were dying in the street
The Brotherhood had already
made a deal with the Military.
They won the Parliamentary elections
And started preparing
for Presidential elections.
The Brotherhood are here to celebrate
And we're here to continue the revolution.
"We're preparing, in God's name"
"To fight the final battle"
The Muslim Brotherhood buys
poor people with oil and sugar.
They mobilize people using religion.
We've accomplished huge gains.
It's a big leap forward that
we've taken Parliament.
This is the will of the people,
the will of the nation.
The Brotherhood made this revolution.
Listen Sir, this was never about the
Brotherhood or the Islamists.
This revolution was made by
everyday people taking to the streets
And the Brotherhood was not
there at the beginning.
I'm tired of arguing about this.
The problem is that
we don't tolerate each other.
You left us to die in order
to take Parliament.
All the people who died
were because of your betrayals.
The Muslim Brotherhood
You shook hands with
the Military and betrayed us.
- Just like this.
- So what?
- It's our right.
- It's your right!
I will not respond to this.
It's our right.
The Brotherhood has the right
to ally itself with the Military?
The same Military
that killed its own people?
Talk some sense into
your Brotherhood friend.
He's saying the Brotherhood
must cooperate with the Military.
Talk some sense into him.
You can have the Square
and do whatever you want
The revolution is coming
no matter what.
What do you think?
They've come to dance.
Who is dancing?
I understand what Ahmed is saying.
Some are dancing
While some are getting screwed.
And we've been destined to
be the ones getting screwed.
The revolution in two words?
A revolution
that removed a regime, ok?
Before the people destroyed it.
Did the Army
protect the revolution?
We didn't protect the revolution,
we made it happen.
You kids
don't know anything.
I was beaten with boots and sticks.
I'm bruised from being
beaten all over my body.
I've lived in the military
world for 40 years.
I am honestly telling you
The Armed Forces are not like this.
At all
You've been entrusted with a
nation's security. It's your duty.
So, all I'm asking is
How can I entrust a nation to
those who can't even protect a woman?
Even if I am your brother
At some point, I must be tough on you.
I don't understand why.
Why?
When the Army first came to the streets
people climbed on tanks
And hugged the soldiers
and clapped for them.
What then? Why?
What's wrong with you?
I swear to you Ghada, one day you'll say
you met General Hamdy Bekheit
And he told you the following
None of the guilty will get away with it.
Whatever happens.
I promise you.
This is a picture of a friend
who took a bullet in his leg.
This is not an Army bullet.
It doesn't look like one.
The most beautiful thing about our Square
Is that everyone who comes here
follows his conscience,
Not some political force.
And that's what makes us strong.
We're here presenting Cinema Tahrir
To remind us why we are here
And to show the people who ask us
why we're still here.
Because only we can tell our stories.
The revolutionaries who toppled the regime
Have died, been injured, or gone to prison.
And with no constitution,
They want to hold elections
stained by revolutionary blood.
Supervised by those
who killed the revolutionaries.
And they made two ballot boxes
One for the killer,
and one for the traitor.
Our voices will keep
getting higher and higher,
Because the streets are our ballot boxes.
I don't want either.
We're stuck between
a rock and a hard place.
We'll have to accept
whatever happens.
Everyone keep your voices down.
With 51.73%
13 million, 230 thousand and 131
Listen up
The winner of the Egyptian
Presidential elections
Is Dr. Mohamed Morsi
Morsi!
Some people are afraid,
but they should give Morsi a chance.
If I were the president, I'd tell the people
to give us one chance.
If Morsi isn't able to prove himself,
he should leave power.
Just give him 100 days.
We waited 30 years for this.
Give him 100 days.
It's still your revolution.
It was the worst day of my life
The day the Muslim Brotherhood took over.
They were the first ones to betray us.
And now they're ruling the country.
They were the only unified
group in the Square.
They have a leader telling them what to do.
They are highly organized.
Our main problem as revolutionaries
Most of the time, we
only object and say "No"
And we never suggest alternatives.
Politics is not the same as a revolution.
If you want to play politics,
you have to compromise.
And we're not good at this, at all.
- We're terrible at it.
- We don't know how to compromise.
We're not organized.
Even strategically, it was obvious
who the real players are
It was either the old regime,
or the Brotherhood.
The Brotherhood wanted Parliament,
and they took it.
They wanted the upper house,
and they took it.
Now they took the presidency.
- What else is left?
- Nothing.
Then this is the end of the Brotherhood.
How so?
That's ridiculous.
They're controlling everything now.
How can you say we will
topple the Brotherhood?
The more they control,
the more people will hate them.
The street is our only way.
After 150 days of Muslim Brotherhood rule,
We found that Mohamed Morsi, who had
promised to achieve the revolution's demands,
Was bowing to the demands
of the Brotherhood Supreme Leader.
He tailored the constitution
to the Muslim Brotherhood
And gave himself privileges
that even Mubarak didn't have.
Mohamed Morsi is not a God.
Mohamed Morsi is an Egyptian
who was elected by 51% of the vote.
Morsi and the Brotherhood abused democracy.
The Brotherhood creature
Has no place in the Square.
We made this revolution.
Why is he hijacking this Square?
If we see a Muslim Brother
coming to the Square
This idea of a ruling Pharaoh
still controlling us
Needs to be broken.
The Brotherhood stole the revolution
During these past months of Morsi's rule,
We have the same problems.
It's crazy, we made a revolution
and no new constitution.
We got a president without a constitution.
The most important thing
is the new constitution
And now it's under their control.
Religion is the biggest problem
we will face in this next phase
Because we have a new political power
That also claims it's a religious organization,
A missionary force,
And this is a disaster.
Magdy, I love you.
But I hate the Brotherhood.
They made shitty decisions,
and we're in a shitty situation.
You elected a president.
You need to be patient.
For how long?
The President is a man who
I trust with my religion.
Can't I trust him with
my politics too?
This is the constitution
of the Brotherhood.
We are Egyptian citizens.
We are not Brotherhood citizens.
You were against torture,
and now you're torturing.
Against corruption,
and now you're corrupt.
Who brought Morsi into power?
The people.
Because they felt you
guys were an oppressed people.
This document will allow what happened to you
to happen to me. Do you accept that?
Of course not.
OK, then take this constitution.
It doesn't serve me.
I hated what they did to you.
I went to the streets because of it.
Why did we go to the street?
Wasn't it to protest against Police brutality?
The Secret Police that tortured you?
You are allowing the Secret Police
to do the same thing to me.
And you're saying "yes" to this.
The people demand
the fall of the regime.
This is the third stage of our revolution.
We got rid of Mubarak, then the Military
Now the focus is on the Brotherhood.
It is a bigger challenge,
because it will include more blood.
When you're fighting your own people, it's
different from fighting the regime.
Because, after all, even if the regime was
extremely violent and vicious
And if they used all the weapons they had,
It's still not as vicious as when the people
fight each other. It's very different.
In the name of God,
I am directing this
to the people
Who have resorted
to violence.
The time has come
for the law
To judge them
and punish them.
He's ordering his people to attack us.
That's the message behind his speech.
Go to the streets
and attack the hell out of them.
The Brotherhood has been
fucking with us for two years.
You go to the toilet,
And they slip in 40 new articles
into the constitution.
It's crazy.
What's happening here
is what happened in Iran.
Soon enough, they will wipe us out,
and all their opposition.
Did you get orders to go to
the streets, or not?
I was in the streets.
You were there?
- I went.
- You were involved in events?
Yeah.
With some friends.
During the fighting?
- Yes during the fight.
- At the Palace itself?
To remove the tents?
You were throwing
rocks on me Assem?
Throwing rocks at me.
Come on.
Let me show you this video.
What happened is a crime against protestors
Committed by the Muslim Brotherhood.
They tore their tents apart
Why attack peaceful protestors?
Oh God.
"We'll butcher you, if you don't
confess you're with the liberals"
- They used weapons?
- Yes
How can a president bring his people to
attack protestors and destroy their sit-in?
Morsi, Morsi!
I was upset that
Assem went to the Palace.
Who were you standing against?
Khalid?
Pierre?
I was standing against them?
What did you think?
You know that one phone call from
the Brotherhood and we're all in the streets, right?
If they tell us to go to Tahrir
it's an order, right?
I would never be proud of standing
with the Brotherhood to attack others.
When this revolution started
I told you that it was for you.
For your sister and brother.
For you to write history.
You have to stand
as an individual.
You can think for yourself.
With all due respect
to you and the Brotherhood
And other Islamists
Or any other groups
You have a brain.
You can think
for yourself.
We have to ask ourselves
"Who created this situation?"
Did the revolution create it?
No.
The person in charge
created this.
The dictator
who has given himself dictatorial powers.
Who's ready to kill us
To force what he wants
and pass this constitution
To have complete
and total power
For eternity.
I didn't see you today at all.
What did Morsi do wrong?
No one has given him a chance.
My butcher the other day yelled
"God Damn you, Morsi"
I asked why.
He said "Because it is so hot. "
Is this a joke?
If there were alternatives,
I wouldn't want Morsi
Honestly, we don't care
about Mubarak or Morsi.
We just want a decent
man to rule with justice.
I don't care if he's a Jew.
We're afraid that if Morsi falls,
we will be taken back to prisons.
Why all the focus on the Brotherhood
and how horrible the President is?
The revolutionaries were your friends.
You lived with them.
- There is a fog in the country.
- No, Magdy
You abandoned one side and chose the other.
I didn't abandon
I chose the side that I grew up with,
that I felt was supporting me.
Magdy has five children.
How does he provide for them?
The Muslim Brotherhood.
All the time Magdy was playing revolutionary,
being filmed, shot at, jailed
What did he gain?
Where did that get him?
I never thought we'd all be divided
Into the Brotherhood and other groups.
I'm sad.
Nothing has changed for my dad.
We haven't gained
from the revolution.
I still can't get
health care.
It's okay.
It's okay.
These are the gains of the revolution
She's filled with tears.
It's okay. Everything will be alright.
Our beloved President
May God make June 30th
a day of pride for Islam
And a day of doom for the
hypocrite opposition.
May you destroy them all.
- Defeat them and make us win.
- Amen.
- Protect us from their evils.
- Amen.
President Morsi is a line you don't cross.
Meaning?
Meaning, if you threaten him,
we'll spill your blood.
Meaning?
Meaning, he's the legitimate elected President
But they're going to the streets
to take him down.
They can go to hell.
Why? It's their right.
No, It's not their right.
Freedom
Freedom
What is revolution?
Revolution is not simply replacing a regime.
Revolution is a culture of a people.
You give them
ownership of their freedom.
That's what we gained.
We were able to introduce the culture
of protesting.
Now they can oppose the ruler whoever they are.
If we predict what's next,
the Army is coming
The Army will return,
let's not fool each other.
But do you think the Army will act in
the same way it did?
Do you think so?
Muslims and Christians
are one hand.
Now the power
is in the hands of the people.
Whoever comes next
The people will continue to pull
rulers out of power
Until people reclaim their rights
And we build the country ourselves.
Isn't that right?
The people demand
the fall of the regime
The people demand
the fall of the regime
The people demand
the fall of the regime
I told the Brotherhood once,
take the Square,
Do what you want
But the revolution is coming despite anyone.
Millions and millions
of people took to the streets
To tell him "Leave"
Millions more than those
who protested against Mubarak,
Protested against Morsi.
This is the revolution's achievement.
Because our revolution's weapon is our voice.
For it to sound in every home.
If you ask me
"What is the revolution's biggest victory?"
It's that kids today play
a game called "Protest"
Where some kids are
playing the revolutionaries,
And others play Police or Army
or Muslim Brothers.
"The people demand
the fall of the regime"
"The people demand
chocolate for kids"
Children of Egypt,
People of Egypt everywhere,
Standing in Egypt's squares and streets,
If the price to protect my legitimacy
is my own blood,
Then I'm ready to sacrifice it cheaply
- Then I'm ready to sacrifice it cheaply
- Cheaply
For the sake of this nation
For God almighty.
Morsi is digging his own grave with his words.
I'm going down to the Square.
I'm on my way.
Of course, there are weapons
in the Brotherhood sit-in.
Aren't those in the Brotherhood
sit-in in grave danger?
We're not going to run away,
so some came with weapons.
Some people think
"Kill those who are coming to kill you"
I hope nothing bad happens.
Power
Determination
Faith
Morsi, Morsi
God is great
You don't want to see your friends,
Khalid and Ahmed?
I want to see them,
But I'm assigned here now.
They told me I need to stay.
I don't want to stand with
one side against the other,
And it could result in death. Understand?
Aren't you sad?
Of course
That your friends are on the opposite side?
Who am I attacking?
Am I going to attack Khalid Abdalla?
Or Pierre who used to host me in his apartment?
The President's speech was not
satisfactory to the people's demands.
Early presidential elections will be held.
The head of the constitutional
court will be the interim President
Until a new president is elected.
Long live Egypt!
Long live Egypt!
Morsi has fallen.
So did the Army and Mubarak.
We're waiting for the next one.
This is our life now,
we'll stay in the street.
I want to go home and sleep.
So tell me Magdy,
what are we going to do now?
Listen Ahmed, I swear to God,
I'm at the Brotherhood sit-in.
We may or may not be massacred.
It doesn't matter.
If you're meant to die,
it's going to happen wherever you are.
The more they kill,
the more we believe in our cause.
The pro-Morsi sit-in declared
that there have been deaths
After they were shot at with live bullets.
A massacre by all means.
Magdy, as much as I've been violent in words
That was just anger speaking.
Well, you're putting
our religion on the line.
You're challenging our belief
of an Islamic country.
Honestly, I want to come be with you.
After all, this revolution was
for a principle, not for blood.
What I feared has started happening
That we're going to fight each other.
We're all your soldiers.
Morsi!
We'll rally beside you.
Morsi!
We'll rally beside you.
Morsi!
I don't want you to get hurt or killed.
Magdy when I gave you a hard time
it was because I was mad.
But we still respect each other's opinions.
And you and I agree
We want the best for our country.
You shouldn't come here.
- You shouldn't come here.
- No, forget it I'm coming.
What will they do? Kill me?
That's up to God's will.
And if I die I'll just
blame it on you, Magdy.
You know me.
I'm not here to die or to kill.
You know my intentions.
I swear, I know that Magdy
May God stop the blood.
We've had enough.
Please just take care of yourself, Magdy.
May peace be with you.
The leaders play on top, and the
people are on the bottom dying.
The people pay the price for everything.
The people always pay the price.
A Muslim Brother, a Salafi, a Revolutionary, a Secular,
a Christian or a Muslim, they're all Egyptians.
Egyptians are paying the price.
The toughest time of my life was
When I was sleeping in my home
amongst my family
And my children.
I would open my eyes and find
Secret Police all around me
Inside my bedroom.
Is this a life?
Is this a life?
One day you'll call my son
And my son might not answer you.
His mother will tell you that Magdy is dead
and so is his son.
Or put in jail.
I would prefer death.
Prison is hard.
Very hard.
I have aged, but it was trying
to achieve my dreams.
We thought the revolution
had succeeded. Not really.
It's not even close.
We won't know if this
revolution has succeeded
For decades.
There is no way in which
the goals of this revolution:
Bread, Freedom, Social Justice, Dignity
There is no way in which those
things can be achieved
In two years.
What you can do is lay the ground
for them to actually happen.
Because when you don't have your rights,
When you're taken for granted,
When you're lied to, when you're killed
Things become pretty clear.
I think what's happening is more
powerful than any one individual
and than any organization.
It's something fundamental inside
people that is moving them.
I don't know how you kill that.
We're not looking for a leader as much
as we're looking for a conscience.
What is a leader anyway?
Are they going to offer
solutions from the heavens?
They won't do that.
The thing is, if we are able to create
this conscience within the society,
We'll be able to find a good president.
We are not looking
for a leader to rule us.
Because everyone who
went to Tahrir is a leader.
We are looking for a conscience.
Freedom is coming, that's for sure
"Liberty" was written in our destiny
They said, riots are in our blood
And how dare we claim our rights?
Freedom
Revolution!
Oh, the Square
Where were you long ago?
With you we sung and with you we suffered
We've prayed and we've been scared
United day and night
Nothing is impossible with you
The sound of freedom is gathering us
And our lives finally have meaning
No turning back
Our voices are finally heard
And the dream is no longer
forbidden
Oh, the Square
Where were you long ago?
You've destroyed the walls and let in the light
You gathered the broken people around you
We've been reborn
And our determined dream was born
We have our differences,
but our intentions are pure
Even when the picture wasn't clear
Honoring our country
and our grandchildren
And the rights that have been stolen
from our youth
Oh, the Square
Where were you long ago?
With you we felt something for the first time
But since then we grew apart
We have to change ourselves
with our own hands
You gave us so much, and now it's our turn
Sometimes I fear that you become a memory
We grow apart and the whole idea fades away
That we forget everything that has happened
And you become only a story to be told
Oh, the Square
Where were you long ago?
Our idea is our strength
Our unity is our weapon
Oh, the square
Where were you long ago?
