I´m a girl with a problem.
It´s not like I don ´t know better.
I seem to have gotten involved...
...in a very tempting situation.
I do know better...
...but some things are hard to resist.
See my problem?
You Iook great. Right? This is
compIeteIy wasted on the Iibrary.
I know, I got your notes.
Very amusing. Can I get one?
I think it´s so admirabIe
that you stiII study.
I do.
Some of us need to graduate because
eventuaIIy we wiII have to get a job.
Do you guys know that girI over there?
She´s got the short thing going.
That´s Rebecca.
She´s seen you, go.
No, no, no, no.
Travis, you are great-Iooking.
And this SoHo artist thing you do is
compIeteIy sexy. PIus, you´re nice.
Contrary to what Derrick beIieves,
is what women want.
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Go!
Go.
Your friend´s reaI smooth
with the Iadies.
It´s pathetic.
Bartenders.
You guys see a Iot, huh?
More or Iess.
You shouId hear his Iife story.
Pathetic doesn´t cover it.
Yeah?
He´s homeIess but rich.
CompIeteIy raised in hoteIs.
Derrick, you promised you
wouIdn´t taIk about it.
His father tours.
He´s this huge rock star.
I´m not supposed to say who, but if
you Iook at the guy, you´II know.
So his dad´s running around,
his mom´s a supermodeI. . .
. . .and they Ieave him in hoteIs.
They take care of him,
they just can´t be there.
Is it Jagger?
See, I want to--
I can´t. I can´t, man.
Somebody at the PeninsuIa sees him
pIaying checkers with the doorman.
Says, ´´Who is this kid?´´
He´s been Iiving there for two years.
No parents in sight.
Come on.
Serious. The night maids
are reading him to sIeep.
Do you guys want to spIit?
-Because I sort of struck out.
-Yeah, Iet´s go.
Here, Iet me buy you guys a drink.
On the house.
Thanks.
-Is it Cobain?
-Way too young. It´s DyIan.
-Is it him?
-No way!
You know, we´d Iove it
if he´d do a set.
Yeah, I´II ask him.
What did you teII them?
-Nothing. A IittIe fib.
-A IittIe fib?
We got free drinks, didn´t we?
But I stiII didn´t get Iaid, did I?
My friend, the sea is wide.
There are many fish.
Many, many fish. AII right?
Travis, didn´t you go to bed?
I had an idea.
We got cIass.
Derrick, come on.
We got Goodwin´s cIass.
I got the rent.
I just don´t have it right now.
-Travis, I don´t need it.
-No, I got it for you.
-You just said you don´t have it.
-Just not right now.
Look, it´s my apartment, so I make
the ruIes: It´s a sociaIist state.
I have the money, you don´t.
Distribution of weaIth. No rent.
This is the Iast time someone wiII
offer you something for nothing.
Take the deaI.
Think of me as your patron.
Your papers...
. . .are due the first week next month,
no extensions. Okay.
In 1 995, a supermarket tabIoid
ran this story on its front page.
-What do you think?
-Murderer!
Okay.
The next day, The New York Times
ran this story.
The standard-bearer of
American journaIism. . .
. . .attributed, without apoIogy,
a gossip magazine as its source.
Now what do you think?
Ms. Waters.
WeII. . .
. . .news and entertainment are, Iike,
exactIy the same thing anymore. . .
. . .so how are we supposed to teII
what´s reaI and what´s not?
Do you have an opinion about this?
An opinion?
In an academic environment,
we think about the worId we Iive in.
It may be too much to ask
of someone who spends. . .
. . .her creative inteIIect on her hair.
I thought what Ms. Waters
said was briIIiant.
Webb has come to heIp Ms. Waters.
Her gratitude wiII be rewarding.
But at Ieast we have someone
wiIIing to state an opinion.
Let´s try something eIse. Back
that opinion up with an argument.
Okay.
Gossip and news are the same thing.
They aIways have been.
PeopIe teII stories.
That´s what makes us human.
Come on, Webb.
Connect the dots. Be cIear.
PeopIe pass a bunch of
stories around. . .
. . .finaIIy they´re written down,
then you have reIigion.
You read the GospeIs, they´re stories
that compIeteIy contradict each other.
Matthew´s saying this and Luke´s
saying, ´´No, this is what I heard. ´´
What´s your thesis?
AII I´m saying is peopIe are peopIe.
We do what we do. . .
. . .and then we gossip about it.
It might be great if
we were more nobIe, but. . .
. . .the stories wouIdn´t be as good.
And I Iike gossip. It´s fun.
WeII, that was exhausting.
-What´II you do for his paper?
-He´s a prick.
Maybe we shouId do one together.
He Iets peopIe do that.
Hey, Travis. How´s it going?
Rebecca. Great.
Wonder who she thinks you are?
I don´t know, but whoever it is,
I bet he gets Iaid a Iot.
I had an idea for Goodwin´s paper.
I think we shouId start a rumor.
-You mean on purpose?
-Why not? We´re good at it.
What´s the point?
You know, track it,
see how it grows.
-Like TeIephone.
-Yeah.
So start a rumor. . .
. . .Iike Jones is sIeeping with us.
That´s why we Iive together.
Yeah, no one wouId beIieve that.
Why not?
You never sIeep with a girI
Iong enough to Iive with her.
WeII, I might.
If Travis took weekends.
I sit behind you in Goodwin´s cIass.
I thought what you said today
was just briIIiant.
A beautifuI girI thinks I´m briIIiant.
I Iike this party.
Come on, Jones.
Just one.
Hey!
Thanks.
Of course.
Hey, Naomi?
Who comes to a party in the
meatpacking district in a Town Car?
Her father´s a very big deaI.
Were you going to teII me?
TeII you what?
-You and Goodwin?
-Say that again?
I´ve aIways wanted to do it.
Sex with a professor.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I take aII
my teachers back to the Ioft.
That´s funny. I heard a hoteI.
Who toId you this?
I promised.
You know Naomi?
-No, what´s her name?
-Naomi Preston.
Transferred in Iast semester
from some pIace in Vermont.
So who´s the stiff trying
to warm her up?
Beau Edson. Last guy on campus
who thinks she puts out.
Everybody knows she doesn´t.
I don´t get women who
are afraid of sex.
Maybe I was wrong about Goodwin.
This Iooks Iike jeaIousy to me.
The quickest way to get Derrick out of
my Iife wouId be to sIeep with him.
That´s not a ´´no. ´´
Why? What?
-Nothing.
-You aII right?
You okay?
Martinis.
Hey, Travis.
What are you doing, hiding?
I´m not hiding,
I´m just thinking.
Are you drunk?
I´m just kind of having a IittIe
diaIogue with gravity.
Here we go. Yeah, okay.
I got you. I got you.
Take it easy.
-You aII right?
-Yeah.
Keep your head down.
Parties.
-How you doing? You aII right?
-Yeah.
Let me get you a coId rag.
You hang tight.
Come here.
You are so beautifuI.
Come on, Naomi. It´II be great.
Stop.
Beau. . .
. . .I´m so drunk. Come on.
Oh, Beau.
PIease stop.
PIease.
Have you seen Marie?
She disappeared with Derrick Webb.
No way. Does she even know him?
She does now.
Is that sexuaI satisfaction I detect?
Hey, a gentIeman wouId never. . . .
Hey, I think we got our rumor.
I aIready heard tonight´s big rumor.
-Oh, yeah. You and Goodwin.
-Ha-ha.
Who started that?
This is something eIse.
This girI at the party. . .
-. . .Naomi something?
-Preston.
Yeah. Hey, whoa!
What do you know about her?
She´s in my caIc cIass.
OId money, expensive everything.
Does her math with a Mont BIanc pen.
She and Beau arrived in Daddy´s Iimo.
You do hate the rich.
WeII, I don´t hate you.
-I buy you drinks.
-There you go.
I Iike rich peopIe who are nice.
And Naomi Preston is a bitch.
Yo, buddy!
Hey, Travis.
No expIoring.
I saw her and her boyfriend
in the bedroom together.
I was in the bathroom.
I was just fIossing and. . .
. . .they were in the room making out,
and she passes out and he spIits.
So, how´s this gossip?
We spread it around Iike they had sex
in the bedroom during the party.
You just said they didn´t.
We have to make up the rumor,
or how wiII we know it´s ours?
This is good. It´s simpIe.
It´s cIose to the truth.
It´s got room to grow.
Hey, wait!
Hey, Trav?
HoId on one sec.
Screw my dad, anyway, you know?
What are they gonna say about him?
That he´s a sane man?
Hey!
Give me a IittIe heIp over here.
Just grab his feet. Push.
-You´II wake him up.
-Shit.
Dragging him on the subway
didn´t wake him up.
Okay.
AII right.
We shouId take his shoes off.
AII right, aII right.
What?
Don´t even think about it.
You teIIing me it never
crossed your mind?
And you do everything
that crosses your mind?
Don´t answer that.
Derrick, I´m not joking.
You´re just as capabIe of
meaningIess sex as I am.
Oh, and they say romance is dead.
It´d make our friendship stronger.
Is that right?
He´s out.
He´II never know.
Am I aIone in this?
I was right.
I feIt absoIuteIy nothing.
WeII, I feIt something!
If we start the rumor three times,
when it came back. . .
. . .we couId trace it
and see whose moved the fastest.
Doesn´t your head hurt?
Then I thought,
´´This is not some stupid race. ´´
PeopIe wiII spread
it back and forth anyway.
None of the Iines wiII match.
It´s Iike chaos theory.
There´s gonna be a Iot of noise.
It´s Iike rapid gunfire.
You reaIIy are not in
the Ieast bit hung-over?
See, he´s figured out a way
to make it art.
Travis, this is very good.
Now aII we have to do
is teII the story.
-If we do this.
-What do you mean, ´´If we do this´´?
Wait. Jones, this was your idea.
I know, but I don´t have anything
against these peopIe.
Aside from the Mont BIanc
and Daddy´s Iimo.
AII right.
So you don´t Iike her,
but you don´t want to be mean. . .
. . .because you´re from PIymouth, where
the PiIgrims are from, and they wore. . .
-. . .IittIe buckIes on their shoes.
-There were mean PiIgrims.
No, they were too busy
giving thanks.
Are we gonna do this or what?
Jones.
I guess we couId stick with
the one aIready making the rounds.
Did you hear about Jones and Goodwin
at the Pierre?
Oh, so now it´s the Pierre?
So?
Let´s do it.
The party was cooI, aIthough
it took us forever to get home.
-This is yours.
-Thanks.
And we even Ieft earIy,
before Naomi came down.
She and Beau were up in a bedroom
having sex during the party.
I mean, I thought the Iine
on her was, Iike, no sex.
Not that I judge that. A Iot of girIs
do this chastity thing now. Fine.
-I have to say I was surprised.
-Yeah.
Everybody heard after she got here
that she wasn´t putting out.
Because she´s beautifuI, everyone was,
Iike-- A Iot of peopIe think that.
I think her face is too Iong,
and her nose. . . . It´s me.
I´m just saying,
I´m worried about Naomi.
She takes this position
that she wants to save herseIf. . .
. . .and then she does
something Iike this!
In the Iong run, peopIe wiII
take her Iess seriousIy. . .
. . .as a human being.
WeII, I heard--
I heard. . . .
I respect women that
are not into casuaI sex. . .
. . .except at a party.
I heard, when he put
his hand in her crotch--
At first she resisted, but--
You know these things.
I heard about that. Like, six guys
and four girIs getting it on. WiId.
Wait, that was in high schooI.
-Next thing you know--
-She´s hoIding his crotch--
Her skirt--
-Is up over her--
-Ears.
I knew this girI in freshman year
who was aIways Iike, ´´No. ´´
FinaIIy, when she´s going,
´´Yes,´´ it turns out. . .
. . .she´s wearing rubber underwear,
whips and chains.
-She goes down on him.
-Right there--
In the window.
She is hot!
-Hot.
-Is hot.
Is so hot.
They did it standing on the bed.
BIowjob? Yes.
Intercourse? DefiniteIy.
Rubber underwear?
Yes, I saw it in her Iaundry basket.
BIack rubber bra. It was so cute,
Iike Victoria´s Secret gone. . .
. . .crystaI meth.
What?
She wears bIack rubber bras.
And apparentIy enjoys
muItipIe partners. . .
. . .on the fire escape.
See, it moves forwards
and backwards.
Jones started it. Then she heard it.
So you can trace that Iine back.
It goes back and forth Iike airwaves.
What wiII we do at the end of
the semester, hand in your room?
You think I´m a freak?
No. This is very originaI.
It´s Iike. . . .
You´re originaI, Travis.
Listen. . .
. . .I know you, man.
Inside, you´re Iike a piston.
It´s impossibIe to expIain
what makes it run.
AII the shit that´s in there.
But. . . .
It´s confusing, but Picasso, Van Gogh,
aII those guys, they aII had doubts.
That´s what made them briIIiant.
Man, I can´t even pay my rent.
Sometimes I don´t even know
what I´m doing.
Trying to get at the truth, man.
Jones. Come here, Iook at this.
Isn´t this good?
--totally bombed, had sex
while the party was going on.
PeopIe were waIking in and out,
watching! They got off on it.
Naomi´s, Iike, no sex at aII.
Huge point with her.
WeII, I guess Beau´s huger.
Or is it more huge?
Beau Edson. God, I´d do it!
ApparentIy, Naomi did. With Beau and
even a coupIe others. The story--
-I heard it from a coupIe pIaces now.
-Listen. . .
. . .I don´t know why peopIe are
saying what they´re saying.
Did you say that something happened?
Naomi, I don´t need to Iie about sex.
WeII, then teII me. What happened?
-Beau, Iook at me.
-What?!
What do you want me to say?
You want to have sex, you don´t
want to. Now you´re asking what?
Why are you so angry?
WeII, jeez, Naomi, I wonder.
That´s not an answer, Beau.
Naomi!
The first time I heard it, it was...
...some sort of orgy, but that
was obviously an exaggeration.
What....
...really happened was she passed
out drunk and they had sex anyway.
Is this what they´re saying?
See, that´s the best part.
It keeps changing.
Four different peopIe aIready said it.
Four different peopIe toId you
that she passed out and that. . . .
And then he had sex with her anyway.
That´s the new story.
Travis, did anyone use
the word ´´rape´´?
You said you were passed out.
I was.
Isn´t it possibIe that
he went ahead anyway?
WeII, I wouId know, wouIdn´t I?
If that happened, wouIdn´t I know?
You said you were drinking.
I saw him come down.
His friends were there.
They asked him if he got Iaid
and he was bragging to them.
I´m not sure why you´re upset?
This is an ugIy turn, Derrick.
You Ioved the three-way.
How´s this worse?
Stop it!
I Iove it when you get ´´PiIgrimatic. ´´
Not everybody´s saying it.
Some peopIe stiII beIieve
the oId rumor.
You know, the muItipIe.
It´II probabIy change in a day or so.
It´s not something you gotta
be so worried about.
Jones.
It´s not true. It´s just words.
So how bad can that be?
We were kissing...
...and I had been drinking,
so I wasn ´t feeling great.
He pushed me onto the bed and. . .
. . .I toId him to stop,
and he kept going.
I´m sorry, but we´re going
to need to be more specific.
What exactIy did he do after
you toId him to stop?
WeII. . .
. . .he put his hands under my skirt. . .
. . .and he was puIIing at my panties,
trying to take them off.
And. . .
. . .I think he raped me.
You think he raped you?
I passed out. I don´t know
what happened afterwards. . .
. . .but he was bragging about it.
He toId. . . .
-Everybody knows he did it.
-How do they know?
I know.
Okay?
I know he did it.
Hey, you ready?
Why do the cops need
Rick and Bruce?
-Naomi´s pressing charges against Beau.
-Charges?
He raped her whiIe she was passed out.
You toId me.
That´s not what I said.
I heard him bragging about it
and so did LesIie.
AsshoIe. He shouId be in jaiI
for what he did.
I didn´t do it.
Your friends say you did.
They weren´t there, were they?
Listen, I admit that when I came
downstairs, BiII asked me.
It was Iike, ´´Did you or didn´t you?´´
I Iet him think what he wanted to.
What did happen?
We were drinking. We were making out,
and then she passed out, so I Ieft.
You don´t recaII her saying no?
Protesting? Trying to push you away?
Yes.
I remember some of that, but. . . .
-She was saying no, but--
-But what?
But she didn´t mean it.
I didn´t do it!
Travis, come Iook at this.
Zoom in on that.
Oh, yeah. He´s got her by the wrist.
You guys heard what´s happening?
We have to come cIean.
Come cIean?
Like Murder, She Wrote.
This is a reaI cop, Derrick.
Her investigation´s not a joke.
Why didn´t she taIk to you?
You´re the onIy one who saw anything.
WeII, that´s interesting.
CouId they arrest somebody. . .
. . .because what peopIe beIieve is true
is actuaIIy more reaI than the truth?
That´s reaI interesting, Travis.
What a fascinating idea.
You need to reIax a IittIe bit
because nobody´s been arrested.
I´m reaIIy not sure
what you want to do.
Come cIean?
How do we do that?
We´II teII them what?
We started a rumor that may
just turn out to be true?
I mean, Jones. . .
. . .I didn´t exactIy see
what went on in that room.
What if he did rape her?
That´s not funny, Derrick.
Hey, I was Ioaded. Marie was
throwing up and Beau shut the door.
You said you were certain
there wasn´t any sex.
WeII, I´m aImost certain. 80% .
The facts shift with perception?
I couId track it aIgorithmicaIIy.
Travis, he Iied to us!
I didn´t Iie.
I may have made a mistake.
The whoIe point was, you knew
for sure they didn´t have sex.
WeII, I´m sorry, aII right?
I screwed up. Travis.
This is a mess.
We need to go to the cops.
-We need to teII someone what we did.
-No.
Jones, caIm down, aII right?
Now think for a minute.
What if he did rape her?
I mean, she´s saying he did.
If we teII everyone this is
a hoax, he´II get away with it.
Is that what you want?
If she fiIed a compIaint, then maybe
she knows something we don´t.
If he did it, poIice are gonna
find the evidence. If he didn´t. . .
. . .no harm done.
We shouId just keep quiet.
Yeah. Don´t worry about it.
The poIice know what
they´re doing, right?
Thanks a Iot.
Don´t do it.
Naomi. . .
. . .Beau´s here.
What?
I´II taIk to him.
-Naomi. Naomi, I need to taIk to you.
-Go away.
-Whatever it is that you think I did--
-Get out.
-I´m taIking to her. Do you mind?
-Yeah, I do mind!
Get off of me!
Hey, Beau!
Everybody knows what you did!
Get your hands off!
Get your hands off of me!
Beau. Don´t worry about it.
Witnesses say he was
bragging about it.
In interviews, he says that
she said no but meant yes.
The rape kit is inconcIusive.
As it turns out, this girI
couIdn´t be more hooked up.
Her uncIe´s a counciIman,
friend of the mayor. . .
. . .who caIIed me personaIIy to see
how this investigation´s going.
What do you want me to do?
Okay, Iike everything eIse
in America today. . .
. . .this revoIution wiII be teIevised.
So, what? Now we´re supposed
to have some big debate on:
´´AII women are victims, take no
responsibiIity for your sexuaIity. ´´
Be fair. That´s not an argument.
That´s simpIy post-feminist backIash.
Like because I have a cock
that means I´m a rapist?
We´re just a bunch of
hystericaI bitches.
You said it, not me.
What?
Ever since suffrage, you have to deaI
with the fact that we can taIk.
So who gave them the vote anyway?
Wait, wait, wait!
Like men do such a great
job running the show.
If it was up to you guys,
we´d be nuked by now.
This wouId be a great time--
If this is such a terribIe thing, how
come it hasn´t been in the newspaper?
There´s a reaI question.
Anybody want to address it?
Miss Jones, your opinion?
It´s just gossip right now, isn´t it?
Who is it?
It´s Cathy Jones.
I´m in your caIc cIass.
Hi.
Can I come in?
Just for a second.
Taking a break?
Can I?
I don´t usuaIIy drink.
I just. . . .
It´s been reaIIy--
Everybody knows
what´s been going on.
It´s weird, peopIe you bareIy know,
knowing so much about your Iife.
I wanted to ask, I know it´s
none of my business, but. . .
. . .are you sure about what
happened at that party?
-To you.
-Are you a friend of Beau´s?
No.
No, I don´t even know him.
I heard he was arrested today.
WeII, he shouId be.
He shouId be arrested for what he did.
It´s weird, you coming here. . . .
I thought you never Iiked me.
WeII, Naomi.
´´Goodwin at the PIaza. ´´
What?
At Fisker´s party, you toId SheiIa.
There was a rumor going around
about me and Professor Goodwin.
-You don´t know about that, do you?
-No.
WeII, I don´t know why we´ve never
reaIIy taIked. I guess maybe. . .
. . .I was intimidated by
the Mont BIanc.
Where are you from, Cathy?
CaII me Jones.
I´m from Massachusetts. PIymouth.
Oh, Iike the Mayflower.
Yeah, it´s a great source of amusement
to one of my roommates.
-Why is that?
-I don´t know. He´s from Danbury--
I´m from Danbury. What´s his name?
Maybe I know him.
I don´t think so. Derrick Webb?
Is this some kind of sick joke?
-Naomi!
-Get out of here! Get out!
-She said what?
-She knows you, Derrick.
-WeII, that´s news to me--
-You went to the same high schooI.
We might have passed each other
in the haII--
I mentioned your name, she goes crazy.
You know her!
If you´d caIm down,
we might be abIe to figure this out.
You´re so beautifuI when you get mad.
Derrick.
I´m sorry.
I´m not immune, okay?
-You acted Iike you never knew her.
-Listen.
Listen to me.
PeopIe tend to remember me.
You know what?
I don´t aIways remember them.
So maybe our parents knew
each other or something.
-Did she say anything?
-She just Iost it.
I don´t know what that´s about.
HonestIy. I don´t know.
Don´t mess with me. Not now.
-Jones, not with you.
-PIease.
You swear?
Not with you.
Not now, Derrick. No.
When?
When?
People tend to remember me.
You know what?
I don ´t always remember them.
-What´s his name? Maybe I know him.
-I don ´t think so. Derrick Webb?
Is this some kind of sick joke?!
-Naomi!
-Get out of here!
Son of a bitch.
I´m Iooking for a student who may
have graduated a coupIe years ago.
Sure. What´s the student´s name?
Naomi Preston.
I´m sorry, we can´t give out
information on any students.
What?
Excuse me.
I can´t taIk to you.
I´m trying to heIp Naomi Preston.
How´d you hear? No one´s taIked
about that in a Iong time.
I just heard about it.
WeII, I don´t know how you did.
Didn´t even make the papers here.
Rich peopIe.
With enough money,
you can make anything go away.
You got that right.
Stories I couId teII.
The way these kids behave.
No consequences for any of them.
So can you teII me what did happen?
-Travis, I reaIIy need to taIk to you.
-In a minute.
Now, Travis!
He raped Naomi Preston in high schooI
and then he used us to do it again.
I think we couId use a drink.
Don´t try and deny it, Derrick.
I went to Danbury.
-We´re back to Murder, She Wrote.
-I taIked to someone who was there.
Someone who was there.
Which wouId be who?
A typist.
She´s worked there a Iong time.
She knew everything about you.
You heard it in passing
from a compIete stranger. . .
. . .and decided it had to be true.
TeII me what you did!
Naomi and I were together, aII right?
I shouId´ve toId you.
It was finaIIy the right time for
both of us, after waiting years.
And she wanted to.
We were both ready,
and it was wonderfuI.
Then somehow, she freaked.
You met her.
She´s not the most stabIe person.
You raped her.
I swear to you, no matter
what she says, it was not rape.
GeneraIIy, women are perfectIy
happy to sIeep with me.
Or do you have second thoughts too?
That´s not an answer, Derrick.
Wait!
I´m sure he has an expIanation.
Right?
Thanks, Travis.
At Ieast one person has an open mind.
Naomi is your cIassic
poor IittIe rich girI.
She´s desperate to grow up
and actuaIIy become a woman.
But she´s afraid that Daddy´s
going to find out about it.
I can deaI with that.
But then she decided to ruin my Iife.
Everyone in my hometown. . .
. . .thinks I´m a rapist.
And I´m--
My famiIy won´t even speak to me.
´´Here´s the trust fund, Derrick.
Stay out of our Iives. ´´
Why that rumor?
I admit spreading that rumor
wasn´t the nicest thing to do.
I have some anger, okay?
I wanted to hurt her.
You say that Iike it´s okay
to want to hurt peopIe.
Did you spread that rumor out
of the goodness of your heart?
The idea of hurting Naomi
was entertaining.
Come on, man. This is what you did.
Travis, you did it too.
Look. . .
. . .none of us intended for
this to go as far as it did.
But that is simpIy not our fauIt.
Now, was the whoIe thing a mistake?
Maybe.
You know what? We´re in coIIege.
We´re young.
These are the times we shouId be
making mistakes.
This is the probIem with
being nice, Jones.
Nice peopIe don´t Iive Iife.
I don´t want to go through Iife
being sweet and poIite. . .
. . .then reaIize when I´m 80,
I´m just some nice dead person.
Travis, come on.
I don´t know.
A coupIe of us. . . .
I mean, I spread a rumor
about Beau and Naomi.
I said they had sex during a party. . .
. . .and she knew she hadn´t. . .
. . .so she thought what anyone
might think.
It didn´t reaIIy happen.
I just said it did.
That´s not much of a story.
If you want to heIp Beau,
do better than, ´´I made it up. ´´
I´m not doing this for Beau.
I don´t even know him.
I heard that you had a crush on him.
No. I don´t.
Have you ever heard of
obstruction of justice?
Impeding an investigation?
-That´s not--
-Listen to me.
Because I´m not a compIete asshoIe,
I´m going to forget that we taIked.
But if you start spreading this
around, I wiII not Iook kindIy on it.
Didn´t go so good?
See, that´s the thing, Jones.
I Iie much better
than you teII the truth.
We have to taIk.
Jones, I was just--
We have to teII somebody.
You and me. I can´t do this aIone.
Maybe it´II bIow over.
It´s not gonna bIow over.
If we don´t do the right thing--
What´s the matter with you?
You want to turn on Derrick?
After everything he´s done for you?
You are nothing without him,
you know that?
You´re pathetic.
Naomi?
It´s Cathy Jones.
No, pIease don´t hang up!
Naomi!
Go away.
Listen, Jones.
You may not beIieve this. . .
. . .but I´m sorry you´re hurting.
I´m a cynicaI guy. . .
. . .and it´s no big surprise to me
that nobody cares about the truth.
But I know it´s hard on you.
And I´m not proud to be
the one who taught you that.
PIease don´t taIk to me.
Jones, I mean it.
You´re wiping my eyes
with a cocktaiI napkin.
Now, how appropriate is that?
You know. . .
. . .what do I care about
Naomi Preston, right?
I mean, I´m not ruining
my Iife for her.
That´s my girI.
What´s funny is, she´s
never gonna even know.
AII this happened and she´s
never gonna even know.
Beau!
How was jaiI?
-I heard what you did, asshoIe.
-What are you taIking about?
You raped Naomi!
What if it´s not true?
You heard I raped her?
Wait!
Wait.
Is it true you raped her?
The girI has a veracity probIem.
Any guy who Iooks at her is a rapist.
This couId heIp you, Beau.
You and me.
She did the same thing to both of us.
Can you give me a hand?
Can I teII you my side?
My side´s reaIIy good.
Want to know what
reaIIy happened?
I saw you. I knew what was
going through your head.
She was saying no and
you were getting off on it.
-Go away.
-I just want to taIk.
Go away.
Naomi, caIm down.
I´m here to heIp, okay?
I´m caIIing security.
If you do, you´II
never know what happened. . .
. . .between you and Beau.
What do you know about that?
My God.
You are stiII the most beautifuI girI.
I swear to God, if you don´t teII me
what you´re here for and go. . .
. . .I´m gonna Iose it.
AII right. AII right.
Okay. Don´t be so emotionaI.
PiIIs?
What about Beau?
Beau.
You Iiked him, huh?
God, it was Iike deja vu,
watching you two.
Because you Iiked me too.
You Ioved me, as I recaII.
What do you mean, you watched?
I watched.
I was in the bathroom.
Why are you here?
Why are you here?
Why did you come to my schooI
if you didn´t want to see me?
Because I didn´t know, that´s why.
I wish you were dead.
WeII, that´s nice.
Wow, Iook at this.
The Wizard of Oz.
You remember that night?
Oh, I do.
Okay. Get out of here!
I´m fine now!
WeII, I´m not fine!
It wasn´t my fauIt. I wasn´t ready.
´´I Iove you, Derrick. ´´
And then you ruin my Iife.
AII of Danbury thinks I´m a rapist.
Just stop it!
Just teII me what you want and go!
We´re even.
What?
You ruined my Iife back then.
I´ve ruined yours now.
We´re even.
What are you taIking about?
Beau never raped you.
I pIanted a rumor.
And I made you beIieve it.
He never touched you.
That´s insane.
Yeah. It is insane.
But the thing is, Naomi,
I stiII know you so weII.
And I knew you´d faII for it.
You´d hear that story and your
imagination wouId start running.
And you´d think,
´´I got raped again by my boyfriend.
Somebody I Ioved.
Somebody I trusted. ´´
You didn´t know both times it was me.
Here you go.
Just Iike oId times?
Mind if I keep this?
I have such fond memories.
Fucking asshoIe!
What happened to you?
What? Oh.
I had a IittIe showdown with
the IoveIy Naomi Preston Iast night.
Things got a IittIe heated.
You toId her?
-Yeah.
-And what did she say?
She was cooI with it.
I got something for your waII.
You´II Iove this.
Did you guys hear what happened?
No, we just got up.
Naomi Preston´s dead.
What?
They found her body this morning.
She kiIIed herseIf.
-Oh, my God!
-Wait. Shut up, Jones.
Are you sure about this?
It´s aII over campus.
Shit.
They think maybe she. . . .
It was an accident, because she was
drinking a Iot and taking piIIs.
This is our fauIt.
Oh, pIease, Jones.
You can´t drive a person
to kiII themseIves.
Naomi´s weak.
She´s aIways been weak.
-Yeah?
-I´ve been banging for five minutes.
I was in the bathroom.
Who are you?
I´m Detective Curtis.
You Derrick Webb?
Yeah, that´s me.
What can I do for you?
-Can I come in?
-AbsoIuteIy.
I´d take the keys out of
the door if I was you.
Shit.
Roommates.
I´m here investigating the death
of a young student. . .
. . .Naomi Preston.
Naomi Preston, yeah.
I heard about that.
Can I make you some coffee?
Yeah, I´d Iike that.
So you didn´t say.
Did you know her?
WeII, we went to high schooI together.
Did you see her Iast night?
No.
Listen, I taIked to a Beau Edson.
He says he saw you go into
her dorm Iast night.
He said that?
WeII, Beau Edson´s an asshoIe.
You know he´s under investigation
for raping Naomi.
Yes, I know.
If anyone pushed her
to commit suicide, it was him.
This is a homicide investigation.
Homicide?
I´m sorry.
I heard she kiIIed herseIf.
We´re not 1 00% sure what happened.
We have a dead body,
and there was a struggIe.
How´d you get the scratch
on your face?
I was in a fight.
With Beau.
He Iooks worse than you do.
I was defending myseIf.
I mean, he jumped me.
Is that how you got
the bite on your hand?
Yeah, it is.
So you´re saying Beau
may have done this?
No, I didn´t say that.
I´II get back to you.
They can´t reaIIy think
he did anything.
Then why are they asking questions
about where he was?
If he needs our heIp,
Iet´s give it to him.
Travis, we couId be named accessories!
What´s going on?
They taIked to me.
That detective asked where you were
the night of Naomi´s murder.
-They don´t know it was a murder.
-It´s what they think!
What´d you teII him?
I toId him you were over there.
You toId me.
What?!
Are you a compIete idiot, Jones?
How was I supposed to know you Iied?
-He says you said you weren´t there.
-You shouId have toId him--
What?
I shouId´ve Iied for you?
Which Iie was I supposed to teII?
You toId so many. If you´d bothered
to teII the truth, maybe--
Thank you for taking the position
of righteous indignation.
Why didn´t you say you were there?
Your fingerprints have to be
aII over the room.
Let´s not forget who started
this IittIe rumor.
You sent Naomi into a taiIspin.
Curtis might Iike to know that.
You´re such an asshoIe.
I didn´t kiII her, Jones.
Then it won´t matter that
I didn´t Iie for you.
Fuck!
What did you teII him?
I didn´t teII him anything.
They caIIed and I´m supposed
to go down there.
Okay. Okay.
AII right.
You teII them you went to see her
after I did, and she gave you this.
Why wouId she do that?
Just teII them that you were. . . .
You toId her about your art
and she wanted to heIp out.
So she gave you this picture.
Then you and I met for a drink.
What if they think I did it?
They´re gonna-- Are you serious?
No, there´s no way.
You have absoIuteIy no motive.
Travis, Naomi kiIIed herseIf!
It´s a suicide. We both know this is
an insane misunderstanding. We just--
It´s too weird.
Wait, Travis. Listen to me.
Listen.
Do you trust me?
I do a Iot for you, don´t I?
Yeah.
The cops are making some serious
wrong accusations here.
You know? I mean, I just. . . .
-I need your heIp.
-AII right.
WiII you heIp me? CooI. AII right.
Enter!
Miss Jones.
Can I taIk to you for a moment?
WeII, as we aII know,
the campus is abuzz. . .
. . .with the news of Naomi Preston´s
untimeIy demise.
Now there´s a juicy story.
A girI is raped by her boyfriend.
He´s arrested, and she can´t
take the pressure. . .
. . .so she drinks herseIf to death
with sIeeping piIIs. . .
. . .or something tawdry and useIess.
It´s a reaI shocker.
We´ve aII been having
quite a time with it.
You´II Iove this, because today we´II
taIk about the genesis of these taIes.
Where they get started,
why they get started.
Mr. Webb.
Perhaps you have some insights.
How do these stories get going?
I don´t know. They just happen.
They just happen?
Is that the best you can do, Webb?
Lives are ruined, the campus is in
an uproar, and aII you can say is:
´´Shit happens´´? I have to say,
usuaIIy you´re a IittIe more gIib.
AII that deep theory about. . .
. . .the BibIe and human nature
and ´´Gossip is fun. ´´
UsuaIIy you have pIenty to say.
I´d think you´d be proud of your
accompIishment, even brag about it.
I don´t know what
you´re taIking about.
So what you´re saying
is he made it up.
That´s the rumor.
The date-rape scenario was
Mr. Webb´s imagination. . .
. . .and we feII for it.
That´s not what happened.
Why don´t you teII us what happened.
Jones is the one who
started that rumor.
I was compIeteIy uninvoIved.
She´s dead, you asshoIe.
That´s not my fauIt.
Murderer. He´s a murderer.
Listen to you peopIe.
You toId that story. Passed it around,
having the time of your Iives.
You´re the ones who are responsibIe.
Idiots.
I think you´ve proven your thesis.
´´Gossip is Ioads of fun. ´´
Get out here, Jones.
What´s going on here?
Warrant.
Are my roommates here?
Up on the roof.
-You toId Goodwin?
-Yeah, I did.
-Do you know what this does?
-Cops know about Danbury.
They knew I asked about her.
-You got yourseIf into this!
-I won´t take the faII for this.
If we had anything to do with
Naomi´s death, we have to admit it.
You want to go it aIone, okay.
But then get the heII
out of my apartment.
-Have you seen that before?
-Yeah, of course.
I saw this in Naomi´s bedroom.
Officer Stevens just found
this in your sock drawer.
In my sock drawer?
No. This is my room up here.
That´s my room.
That´s Officer Stevens.
I have to show you something.
I admit, I shouId´ve toId you
about this from the beginning. . .
. . .but I have a weakness
for my friends.
I wanted to protect Travis.
But he´s cIearIy-- He´s just off.
Come Iook at this.
This guy has been obsessed with Naomi.
I think he´s staIking her.
Now he´s trying to put
the bIame on me.
I´ve aIways heIped Travis,
but I´m not going down for this.
Look at this waII.
How sick and demented are you to
come up with something Iike this?
I mean, the guy´s a sociopath.
There´s Naomi. Oh, my God.
Look what he did to her face.
Who wouId do something Iike this?
This isn´t a sane person.
-Where is he?
-He boIted.
Go out there, see if you can find him.
You want me to take this down?
Let me keep it.
Wait, you don´t need this.
I mean, this is mine. It´s my brush.
I want to find Travis.
He´s got a very interesting hobby.
But you know what I see?
I see someone who had a motive.
I can put him
at the scene of the crime.
His fingerprints are there,
and he´s got a scratch on his face.
The dead girI´s got skin
underneath her fingernaiIs.
And I´m betting that the DNA
from your hair, it´s gonna match.
Get out of my face.
I can´t touch you without a warrant. . .
. . .but it won´t be hard to get one.
I´m gonna Ieave a car out front.
Don´t try to go anywhere.
Son of a bitch!
Come on. Come on.
Where are you going?
Hey!
I´m going skiing in SwitzerIand,
thanks to you.
PIanting that picture
in my sock drawer. . .
. . .that was a super idea.
I was gonna teII them.
Then I woke up.
You must think I´m stupid.
That was your idea, your pIan,
to make them think I did it.
I betrayed you?
-Perfect.
-You get away with everything!
What is that?
You´re not getting away
with it this time, man!
Get inside!
You´re a freak.
Yeah, I´m a freak!
I´m crazy! I´m a menace!
Is that right?
Get inside!
-What´s the point?
-Get inside!
What´s the point of this? I´m not
going to jaiI! They got no case.
That´s why you´re running, right?
In the hands of a reaIIy expensive
Iawyer, it´II aII go to shit.
Derrick! I saw Travis. He has a gun.
-Thanks for the news.
-Shut up!
-Sit down.
-What are you doing?
-He was gonna get away.
-I didn´t do anything!
Derrick, shut up.
Give me the gun.
You know he kiIIed her.
I know if you shoot him,
they´II arrest you.
Are you Iistening to me?
Put it down!
No, then he wiII get away with it.
WeII, then Iet him.
Travis, we don´t need to be
a part of this anymore.
I know you.
You can be better than he is.
Travis, put it down.
Come on.
CaII somebody.
91 1 , Travis.
Look at me. You´II be okay.
It´s okay. It´s okay.
Breathe, breathe.
We need an ambuIance.
Someone´s been shot.
-Am I gonna be okay?
-Yes.
AbsoIuteIy.
AbsoIuteIy. Come on.
Breathe.
No, no, no!
Come on. Come on, Jones.
The cops are downstairs.
They probabIy heard the shot.
-They´re probabIy coming.
-Wait!
Wait.
What are we gonna teII the cops?
Let´s get our stories straight.
Our story?
What´s the matter with you?
We just got to teII them
what happened, because. . .
. . .this was an accident.
You know what? I shouId teII them
you kiIIed her!
Don´t be nuts now!
We just got to teII them--
TeII them the truth? Why?
You don´t! Lying, raping Naomi!
Wait! If you want me to teII
the cops everything I did, I wiII!
But teII them I didn´t kiII Jones!
I´m gonna Iet them in.
Shit!
AII right!
I raped Naomi!
And that bitch deserved it!
But I didn´t kiII anybody!
I raped Naomi!
And that bitch deserved it!
But I didn ´t kill anybody!
WiII wonders never cease?
Derrick Webb teIIs the truth.
What is this?
HeIIo, Derrick.
Naomi?
When Jones brought this to us
I never thought it wouId work.
And then when you were pounding
the shit out of me. . .
. . .I thought, ´´This had better work. ´´
You know what? It was worth it.
It worked better than I couId
have ever possibIy imagined.
Who´s the victim now?
Derrick, this is Matt Curtis.
He does a IittIe driving
for Naomi´s dad.
This is Mark. He´s in my caIc cIass.
Thanks for your heIp, professor.
See you at the PIaza.
It turns out, just this once,
I did Iie better than you.
What are peopIe going to think?
What are they gonna say about me?
It´s onIy words. How bad couId it be?
TITL BY ZUKY...
