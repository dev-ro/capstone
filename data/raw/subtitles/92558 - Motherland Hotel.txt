Who would know if not you?
You're the hotelkeeper.
True but I need to tell to the person who untie me

Mahmut Gorgun. It's not his name
but he'd give a false ID.
18 October Friday. Good.
What would he do here?
He'd sit at that chair mostly.
Read his papers; every day a bunch of papers.
Close to noon he'd come down and go out for lunch;
evenings too. I wrote all these into daily registers.
- What registers?
- Police registers, sent to police station.
Ah, those. Nobody checks them at the station.
They throw it away somewhere.
- But why would they make us write it?
- Of course there's a reason.
- Cut the crap. It was him, right?
- Yes. Retired officer.
He told he's retired officer√æ son of a bitch.
- Wasn't he?
- When did he leave?
- Ten days ago, friday morning.
- How was he while leaving?
He had the same clothes.
Small leather case in hand...
He hadn't shaved that morning; looked sickly.

- Trafficking woman to Africa'ya.
Strangled his own daughter.
