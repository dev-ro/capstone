Come here, kids. Come here.
Hey you, Stop!
Stop!
- This is Miss Morris, Lieutenant.
- Good morning. Please, take a seat.
I'd like to introduce you to Inspector
Logan from the F.B.l.
Sheila Morris.
We're lucky that you left
Alabama's sunshine.
Thanks for coming right away.
That's what I call a sense of duty.
Did something happen to Diana? I didn't fully
understand what they were saying on the telephone.
Sorry. How long has it been
since you've heard from your sister?
About six months. But why?
Did something happen to her?
I don't think so.
Nothing definite. Where is she now?
Six months ago she was here in New York.
She was doing sculpture in Greenwich.
She called me once in a while
and she seemed very happy.
After that she disappeared, but
I didn't worry too much.
It wasn't the first time
she'd done that.
Sheila, some strange things happened
in New York and elsewhere last week.
Three murders, three men killed
by darts soaked with cobra poison.
- Cobra poison?
- Exactly.
And all three were killed by the same man, an
Asian. He was Birmanian, or maybe Malaysian.
But we can't bother him with questions because
he was hit by a truck. He had no identification.
Strange, don't you think? We know absolutely
nothing about him except that he's Asian.
We're pretty much in the dark.
Okay, but I don't understand
the connection to Diana.
Look. We found this in the
killer's pocket.
What is it?
An 8mm color film. Diana Morris,
14 East Street, is written on the box.
The landlady there told us some
interesting things.
Apparently, your sister was
involved in a questionable group.
Have you heard of a
certain Jonas?
No. Who is he?
A crazy man, probably a drug
addict.
He was preaching in Greenwich about returning
to nature leading to the salvation
of the soul, and other nonsense.
Now he has a group of naive
ecologists in the palm of his hands.
- And you think that Diana was...
- Yes.
We think she's one of his
followers.
It seems they all left together.
But... where?
That's what we'd like to know.
Listen Sheila, your sister, wherever she is,
is somehow involved in these three murders.
She hasn't written to you
in all these months?
We haven't been close lately.
We almost never saw each other.
We have to find her.
The F.B.l. is already involved.
Meanwhile, you should watch
that film. We've already seen it.
It's very interesting,
believe me.
That's my sister Diana.
Can you tell where this is?
Judging by the Buddha,
somewhere in Southeast Asia.
What are they doing,
Professor Carter?
I don't know.
But it's very strange.
You mean cruel?
Professor, where was this shot?
I need to know, that's why I came to you.
This film is the only clue I
have to find my sister.
I understand, but I can only
form a hypothesis.
That strange night ritual could
be a Fakir Gathering in Borneo,
or a ceremony of the
Purification Sect in New Guinea.
But I can't say with any
certainty.
Sorry, what was that?
Purification Sect... What is that exactly?
An ancient indigenous ritual society that
uses pain to bring man closer to nature.
A kind of primitive ecological
union, let's call it.
A sect that's against the contamination
of the environment and it's resources.
In short, they're a group of
fanatics.
They refuse to accept current
civilization, they feel it's corrupted.
But what relationship could my
sister have with these people?
It's said that the sect has followers
everywhere, even in the United States.
I find it pretty unlikely,
but then again,
Americans usually love anything
that's tax free.
Anyway, we'll look into it
further.
Hi, Alma.
Do you remember me?
No, but if you're with the
police then leave me alone.
I haven't shot up in over
three months.
No, no Alma. I'm Professor Carter, you worked
for me two years ago at the East Institute.
Don't you remember?
What do you want?
Can you just tell me?
Listen, does the name Jonas
mean anything to you?
I don't want to hear about that
pig. Look. Look what he did to me.
He's crazy, you understand?
All his lies about the Sect of Purification
were just bullshit to attract other idiots.
Yes, he hides behind them and makes them his
servants. Here's his beautiful religion.
Here's how he purified me.
Where's Jonas now?
Do you know?
That big son of bitch took
all their money and convinced them
to follow him to a pristine and pure world.
To Merauke, or whatever the
hell that place is called in New Guinea.
Mind your own business or
I'll break you!
Leave me alone, cockroach! Don't touch me!
Leave me alone, you coward!
Just stop it, bitch!
Leave me alone!
We can go, Sheila.
We won't waste any more time.
You disgust me!
You're lousy!
Are you Miss Morris?
Yes, I am.
I received a telex from
Professor Carter. Welcome to New Guinea.
Hello.
Listen, I don't care that you're
American too. Your problem is your problem.
Maybe, but you've got a problem too.
Seven years ago you deserted in Vietnam.
As you can see, I know everything.
It was an ugly war, I don't blame you.
Listen, why don't you find someone
in the consulate to help you instead of me?
I make a lot of money here. That game does
really well for me. You saw it yourself.
If one of those bad guys cuts
off your arm, what'll you do then?
Send it to the horror museum?
No, no I'll send it to you as
a souvenir.
Mark, I'm counting on you.
You're the only one who can help me.
Do these mean anything to you?
No, but they were taken in
Sakir, a village 400 miles into the jungle.
Have you ever heard of
the Sect of Purification?
Listen dear, this part of the
world is famous for two things:
religious mania and venereal diseases.
All I know is that those
ceremonies are done in Sakir.
Fools that love to be hammered
on their feet.
I'm willing to pay you well if
you take me to Sakir.
You're crazy. There's yellow fever
there, and it's the kingdom of cobras.
You're scared, aren't you?
Certainly. Thanks for the offer
though, pleasure was all mine.
Find another idiot and have
a good trip.
Hey, where are you going?
Wait a minute...
I only work for cash.
It's a little different from
the dusty Alabama plains, right?
Yes, there's less smog.
And fewer cars. Are you tired?
Tell me...
What's a girl like you doing in
a place like that?
Oh, just watching poor black men break
their souls at my father's cotton mill.
Very good. What else?
Listening to rock music.
You like rock?
No, I like whiskey.
Here we are.
This is Sakir.
You owe me 20,000 George.
George who?
George dollars.
$20,000.
This is Sakir?
What did you expect?
Rockefeller Center?
Where are the natives?
Look!
It's just like the picture.
Down!
You see, that was useful in
Vietnam.
Stand up!
Stand up and put your hands up!
Hurry!
What do you want?
Listen pal, if you don't lower
the gun, it'll be difficult to talk to you.
We're searching for my sister,
Diana Morris.
We know she's been here.
No, no white people have been here,
except two Norwegian guys a month ago
that ripped off a set of precious stones.
But this time I'm doing the
ripping. Come here!
And no jokes, you understand?
Sure, I understand.
And you be careful, when old
Reeves gets fed up he gets dangerous.
The watch!
Go inside!
That watch belonged to
my sister, I'm sure.
Okay, sure. The watch confirms
she was here, obviously.
You know, I don't like the story with
this old man, I don't like it at all.
That man seems like a criminal.
Mark, I'm scared.
I know what you're thinking
but it doesn't necessarily mean that...
That they killed her?
Is that what you're trying to say?
Is your sister rich?
Three years ago, after the death of our
father, we inherited his cotton mill.
I was depressed and Diana took
over the administration of the company.
She was in charge of everything.
She was sending me a check regularly until six
months ago. Then she suddenly disappeared.
There's obviously something
wrong here.
I don't expect you to get
involved in this out of pity.
Look, I'll give you $80,000
if you help me find Diana again.
- $80,000 more?
- Yes.
Dead or alive?
Dead or alive.
Curiosity killed the cat.
Be quiet! Get up quickly! Fast!
Come on, move!
You know Reeves, I get dangerous too. And now
tell us, where's Diana Morris? Where is she?
I swear I don't know anything.
Tell us or I'll break you in
two, asshole! Where is she?
No, stop! Stop!
Diana Morris is alive.
Yes, alive.
Where?
She went with the others a long
time ago.
Jonas decided to build the Village of
Purification in the jungle,
along the river in a place where
no white people would find it.
Why'd you stay here?
I was sick. I wouldn't have
made it.
The jungle beyond Sakir is dangerous, very
dangerous.
No one has ever come out of there alive.
Listen, I'll make you a
good deal.
I'll give you one dollar and in return you give
me a canoe, two guides and supplies for a week.
And this of course. Agreed?
Take it.
And don't try to fool me, or when I come
back I'll unload this gun in your head.
Got it? Bravo! OK? Good.
It's the survival of the fittest. Don't be
sad, Sheila, unfortunately we'll see worse.
Don't get scared.
- Do you want a sip of whiskey?
- No, thank you.
You're always reserved, huh? You treat me like a
stranger, but we have a long journey to make together.
Yes, and is this where you
want to go?
Not bad.
By the way, that $80,000
includes taxes.
Sure, but not the right to
take you to bed.
Right!
- Be ready to leave tomorrow at
dawn, do you understand? - Yes.
If you weren't so presumptuous,
I'd also gladly go to bed.
The village shouldn't be far,
unless Reeves lied to us.
It's this lack of human presence
that makes me uncomfortable.
We're really unlucky, only this
was saved. Do you want it?
Listen, stop thinking, it doesn't
work. It was an unfortunate accident.
We couldn't do anything to stop
it, do you understand? Now forget it.
We're in a real mess, we lost
the canoe and he's scared to death.
Take a drink.
As you wish.
Wake up! Careful.
That son of a bitch ran away.
He took the other backpack with
the flashlight and the machete.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
- Mark!
- What's up?
Listen, there's nothing, not
even the hum of the insects.
Come on, let's go.
- Come on!
- Let's go!
Look!
Shut up!
Come on!
Stand up!
Stand up, Sheila!
Let's not waste time. We have to run if we want
to get out of here alive. Do you understand?
We won't get out alive. It's
impossible and you know it!
Move, and hurry!
Walk!
I saw some pretty bad things in Vietnam...
decapitated women, burnt children,
old men blinded by gas...
but this is crazy.
It's like going back 5,000
years to the Stone Age.
Mark...
You have to promise me
something...
What?
When the cannibals attack us,
I want you to kill me.
You feel better?
Now Mark, now. We might
not have another chance.
Come on, come on.
I can't do it anymore. I'm
tired, I'm hungry.
Do you want to walk?
Let's go, fast! Fast!
Who are you?
Calm down, you have nothing
to worry about now. You're safe.
This will make you
feel better. Relax.
Are you a doctor?
No, I'm Dick. I'm one of Jonas'
followers.
Why'd you come here?
If you have no faith in Jonas
and the purification...
God help you.
Everything's okay. We
arrived just in time, Jonas.
Welcome to the Village of
Purification.
Two new followers will be
well-accepted in our community,
provided their spirit
is humble and sincere.
In this place we've rediscovered
the value of life in nature,
free from the pollution and corruption that
are ruining the so-called civil world.
As the prophet Isaiah says, "We have been
chosen to redeem the world from sin.”
Listen friend, I'd like to
explain why we're here.
We only want...
You'll have plenty of
time to explain.
You won't be allowed to leave,
this has to be clear from the start.
Besides, it's impossible,
you've seen what happened to that
young indigenous woman who
tried to leave the village.
Unfortunately, our
community is under threat
from fierce tribal cavemen
who practice cannibalism.
Bloody and savage beings that
feed on human flesh.
But we know how to control them.
Cobra's poison. It's the only
way to defend ourselves.
Where are the women in
this community? I have to see them...
I know the reason you're here.
Brother Reeves from Sakir informed me.
Your sister is alive and happy.
You'll see her in a few hours.
Diana's alive!
You owe me $80,000 in cash.
Right now Diana's in spiritual
retreat with the other women.
Today we're mourning, one of our brothers took
his life in most unfortunate circumstances.
At sunset, the funeral ceremony
will take place.
She's changed.
I almost don't recognize her.
She's got a strange look.
The widow must light the
funeral pyre.
How long does this last?
We keep vigil all through
the night.
Then there will be the final rite, the one
that releases the young widow from any further
bond with the deceased husband.
They're the brothers of
her husband.
This rite is about to end their
bonds of kinship.
Great. Hope they do it soon.
- Sheila!
- Diana!
I almost can't believe it.
It was terrible, but now we're here alive.
Little sister, it's such a joy
to see you.
But tell me, Why'd you risk
so much?
I thought you were in danger.
You just disappeared without
saying anything.
You're right, I should've
explained it to you.
I should've written...
but I thought you might not understand.
However, I made this choice of
my own free will, and I'll never go back.
But, Diana...
You have to believe me. See Sheila,
within the rules of the Purification Sect
I've found my inner balance.
I found a sense of authentic life,
uncontaminated. Nature is all for us
and it's laws are sacred.
The world I left, with my spontaneous free will,
causes pollution and ecological destruction.
It's a corrupt world, a
hopeless world, Sheila.
But you had a job, interests,
friends...
I still have them here.
But what's happened to you?
What you just said sounded like something
you memorized. Come on, spill the beans.
Yes, it was a script that I
didn't perform well.
But now you're involved in this
dirty business, and it's my fault.
Calm down, Diana.
I'm paying the price for the mistake of
believing Jonas in New York,
with his speeches on purification
and paradise in the near future.
I followed him here with all the others and
instead of the last paradise, we built a hell.
But how could this happen?
Jonas is a false master.
Piece by piece, I discovered what he is.
He's crazy, sadistic, a man
thirsty for power. I feel sick.
Look, we'll get out of here. I
came here with Mark to bring you home.
It's impossible. The jungle
here is full of cannibals, and besides,
Jonas would be able to reach us
anywhere.
He's already had three men killed
in New York and Canada because they left.
But we've got to try.
I'm not about to give up.
Act like nothing's happening.
Dick is spying on us.
We've got to sneak out of this
crazy place.
I don't want to end up a slave
to that maniac Jonas.
And I want to get that
$80,000 too.
Be careful, Jonas is coming.
Up. Good boy.
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Lieutenant Grant.
- First floor.
- Thank you.
There are no doubts.
Professor, we've finally got the evidence
to prove that those three poor people
were murdered at the request of the
infamous Jonas, but he's still unreachable.
That seems absurd in the
twentieth century.
I apologize, Miss Morris didn't tell me about
these crimes, otherwise I would've come sooner.
And Sheila wouldn't have
disappeared like her sister.
Don't exaggerate, Inspector.
Sheila's in Merauke, New Guinea.
She was, Professor, until
three weeks ago.
What's this?
A telex from the US Consulate
in Merauke in response to
our urgent request for
information.
That's really bad news.
There are still cannibal tribes
in the jungle Southeast of New Guinea.
What?
Cannibals.
Instead of eating meat from
the supermarket,
they prefer to eat people
like us.
It's one solution to the hunger
problem in the world.
Sergeant, I need to speak to
Guinea immediately.
No, Guinea's not a blonde girl,
it's a fucking place with Cannibals.
Brothers!
Never must we be more united than in this
moment of crisis, in our will of purification.
United!
We must strongly reject what is foreign
to our nature, the spirit of evil.
Don't drink that. It's drugged.
No! Stop it! Leave him alone!
Stop!
Brothers!
There are two great perils that
endanger the well-being of our community.
The wild men of the caves, and
the so-called civilized men.
Fortunately, the latter are
far away.
But if the others were
ever to threaten our sect,
then we'd have to face
the ultimate decision.
To drink together, with joy, the amber that now
gives life, but on that day would bring death.
What could be more beautiful than
all going together on the ultimate trip?
I'd be the first, and I'm sure none of you
would refuse to follow my example.
As the Prophet Isaiah says, “We have
been chosen to redeem the world from sin.”
Today we must be united, like never
before, in our will of purification.
What could be better than to
go together on our last journey?
Drink, Mark.
Let's go, someone's coming.
You're not like Jonas and the
others, you deserve freedom.
He has a hold of me, of
my conscience. It's horrible.
I know, I've been
through it before.
He repulses and he charms, until
you don't know what you're doing,
You're ashamed of yourself, and at the same
time you feel strangely attracted to him.
Is it true?
Yes.
Last night I was forced to drink
that stuff,
and afterwards I didn't
understand anything anymore.
Diana, I beg you, help me.
We have to rely on Mark.
We can only hope that he's managed to get
back and find someone who can help us.
Stop!
I was wrong, Jonas. I was wrong...
I'm asking to join the community.
Please Jonas, I want to be yours.
I have to talk to you,
but quickly.
If Jonas finds out I'm here,
it'll be a mess.
Look, Diana, I know what you want to say,
but we don't have much time.
It's better if I speak first.
Listen closely.
You have to trust me, even though
you've only known me a few days.
There's no way to escape this
unless we're cunning.
- So, you were pretending today?
- Yes.
I realized that escaping alone,
through the jungle, is impossible.
Our only hope is the river. It's the only
safe way, but we have to be well-organized.
We'll need a canoe and an
indigenous guide.
There's Mowara, that young
widow.
We've become friends,
I'm sure she'll help us.
Maybe, but we have to do it soon.
That's why I asked to join the sect,
to have more time and
not draw suspicion from Jonas.
I'm afraid for my sister.
Jonas is corrupting her, the
same way he did to me.
Hurry!
We have to go now. It's time for Karan
to come around for his nightly inspections.
Okay, but be careful.
Brothers! Do you remember the
parable of the prodigal son?
Well, the prodigal son is back
with us.
His desire for purification seems sincere, but
his will to follow the rules must be tested.
By drinking the sacred amber,
he will become a member of the community.
Karan!
Leave her alone!
Leave me alone!
Stupid!
Jonas! Jonas, I swear, no!
Stop! Stop, please, stop!
No, Jonas!
Master Jonas!
What's happened?
We found him out
getting drunk, this pig.
No, it's not true Jonas,
I I didn't want to.
I saw you. You tried to hide the bottle
under the floor of the infirmary.
You've violated a fundamental rule.
You've jeopardized the order.
I'm sorry, but you have to pay.
Forgive me. Please, Jonas. I
didn't want to.
It was a moment of
weakness. Please, forgive me.
You should've thought about
that earlier, Porter. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again, I promise you.
Forgive me, I'm old... Please.
You'll be given supplies,
weapons, and a Bible.
At sunset you'll go, and you
will not return to the village again.
You don't belong here anymore.
No, you can't send me into the
jungle. I'll die, Jonas.
Karan!
No, Jonas! No, I'm a poor
old man!
Jonas.
Shhh... Shut up.
Sheila, don't say anything.
You don't have to justify yourself
to me at all.
I almost don't recognize myself. It's
as if I'm sinking into an abyss.
I'm going crazy. Please, Mark,
take me away from here.
Sure, I'll take you away. Do
you think I want to lose $80,000?
But there's one important
thing, Jonas can't suspect us.
Jonas..."
Every time I come back to my
senses I... I want to kill him.
But then I always end up
giving in.
Listen, you'll resist. It's
only a few hours now.
Tomorrow there's the feast of
purification, and that night we'll escape.
But Karan watches us. What
do you plan to do?
They'll be too tired to worry
about us.
But you have to promise me
one thing.
What?
Don't drink anything Jonas
offers you, anything.
Do you understand?
All right!
Aren't you thirsty, Sheila?
Why don't you drink?
That's it, take it.
You've been ignoring your
chores since you became a widow.
What were you doing on
the riverbank yesterday?
Well... Really...
Yes?
Nothing, master.
I do my best to serve the community
and to be worthy of your trust.
He was hiding whiskey in
his hut.
Karan accuses you of
breaking our rule against using alcohol.
You know what awaits you.
Listen Jonas, whiskey's my passion, but I
haven't had a drop since I've been here.
Karan found the bottle in
your hut.
Karan, you're a liar!
Jonas, tell him he's a liar!
Did you hear that? He says
that it's not true.
Stop!
You've proven your good
faith. The case is closed.
Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, son
of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
And Jehu said, "If such be your feeling, may no
one leave or escape to announce it in Israel."
Joram learned of the
conspiracy and said,
"We have been betrayed Ahaziah.
I will requite you in this very field.”
Jehovah's oracle came to pass.
The dogs devoured Jehu's flesh.
That's all for tonight.
Diana, wait.
I've got something to tell you.
Look into my eyes.
Don't be afraid.
What's wrong? I feel that
tremble.
Leave me alone, Jonas.
It's over.
I've given you everything you wanted. I made
you rich, I loved you, but that's enough.
Don't torment me anymore.
Why?
Our lives are tied to a higher
will, a bond that only death can break.
Watch, Diana!
Think about the fate of Jehu
and of Jezebel.
As they went to bury her, all
they found were the skull, hands, and feet.
Down, down.
Hurry!
What's going on, Sheila?
She's been drugged.
Let's go. We have to leave.
Don't look at me like that.
Listen, Sheila.
We will leave.
Mowara's hidden a canoe along
the river a few miles from here,
but we don't have time to waste.
Do you understand? Stand up,
Sheila. Try to move. Wake up!
Stop! No. I belong to Jonas!
- Move!
- No! No!
No, No!
There's nothing else we can do.
Let's go!
Did you hear them? They'll be
here soon. Let's go.
All four of them ran off
last night.
They betrayed us. Karan
was right.
Let's go! Look for them!
Jehu, son of Jehoshaphat, son
of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
No, we made a mistake during
the night.
We're moving away from
the river.
This way.
- Hurry up!
Sheila... Mark!
Maybe the effect of the drug
has worn off. We can untie her!
Okay. Come on, Sheila. Give me
your wrist.
Be good, and try to walk as fast as you
can. And I'd recommend not talking.
No!
Stop!
We shouldn't stay exposed. Come.
Sheila!
Sheila!
They're here, run away!
Help, Mark! Help! Help!
- Cowards!
No! Mark!
I swear, Karan, no!
I don't want to!
I don't want to,
I don't want to!
Please, please no!
No, I beg you! I beg you!
Mark!
Mark!
I'm here!
Mark!
Sheila!
Come on.
Take my hand and pull
yourself up.
Quickly, it's not hard.
- I can't do it.
- You see what to do?
Be brave. Go ahead, get a
good footing.
Pull up, hard.
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
No. What happened to me?
I'm so confused, I don't
remember anything anymore.
I'll explain it later, Sheila.
Right now we have to leave.
Up, let me take these off.
Where's Diana?
She's with Mowara, she's
waiting for us. Hurry.
- Help!
- That's Diana's voice.
Have mercy!
No! No!
Even in Joram's realm there was
betrayal and defection.
But in the end he overcame the
Lord's oracle.
Have faith, don't give in to
our enemies.
If the big time has come, we'll
face it together.
Yes, Jonas, yes.
Any news from Karan?
No, nothing.
Send more men into the jungle.
Have them search the course of
the river.
I want those bastards here.
Here.
Yes, Jonas.
I saw her, you know, before
losing my senses.
They'll get to us soon. They'll
kill us, Mark.
Mark! No! Stop!
Are you hurt?
It's nothing.
Sheila, we only have one
decision to make.
Go back to the village...
or we do it, here and now.
Here and now.
Kiss me.
They can't be far away if
you've found the canoe.
Move!
Damn!
Your reign is collapsing like
that of Joram, Jonas.
May God have mercy on us.
They want to lock me up in their dirty
prisons, but they won't succeed.
I won't leave my people
without guidance.
Prepare the sacred amber with
the cobra poison.
Help!
- Help! Help!
- Help!
Quick, Mark! Quick!
Come on, come on!
They're down there, they're
crossing the river. You have to go down.
It'll be really hard to pull them up.
Where the hell do you want me to land?
They're being chased by
the cannibals.
- Hurry up!
- Come on, quick! Fast!
Wait!
Hurry, Mark!
We had a close call.
Drink with happiness, brothers.
Come on Ruth, come on.
Take it Margaret, you take it.
The child first. Take it.
What are you waiting for? Let
him drink.
Forgive me, Lord, and accept me
with your mercy.
Farewell, Jonas.
The recovery of the remains of the eighty
members of the Purification Sect continues.
There are many victims of the sudden mass suicide
that took place a week ago in New Guinea.
The man responsible for this medieval
tragedy, the man who convinced
thirty Americans and fifty indigenous
people to die, is Jonas of New York.
Melvin Jonas was called Great Master
or Sacred Guide by his disciples,
yet Jonas' body has yet
to be found.
There are those who claim he escaped death
and has been hiding in the jungle...
Try to recover... and forget.
Good morning.
Good morning, Professor Carter.
How do you feel today?
Better, thank you.
Any news, Inspector?
No, nothing. The preliminary inquiry
was set for tomorrow morning.
Miss Morris, I'd like to ask
for one favor.
The committee would prefer not to
mention the adventure with the Cannibals.
What? Why?
It's a sensitive issue and
public opinion couldn't handle it.
And there are political and
economic interests to consider.
I hope you realize that.
Sure.
What should I say about
my sister?
That she committed suicide?
Yes.
No, Inspector, I'll tell the
whole truth.
I don't care about your dirty
political or economic interests.
The whole world needs to know
that the Stone Age still exists.
Not everyone's living in the
Space Age.
Okay, okay, sure I get it. I
understand.
Now listen, you and your
damn bank can go to hell.
They're finally gone.
What's up?
What's up? Do you really want
to know, dear?
Remember the $80,000 check you
gave me?
It was rejected by the bank, it
bounced.
You have nothing, not even a
dollar.
Your sister, before leaving New York, handed
over the entire inheritance to Jonas.
And as you heard on the TV,
no one knows where the fuck he's gone.
Now who'll pay your expenses?
That's what I'd like to know.
