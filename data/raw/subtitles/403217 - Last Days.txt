The only reason we...
even...
that it was even...
that she... that it was
even mentioned
in the... in the first place
is really... it wasn't for us,
you know,
like that she...
big fucking favor.
This fucking...
swamp.
'Cause I'm afraid...
You can't do anything.
You can't do anything.
I can't.
I don't know what I'm...
God, it's just...
I don't know.
Just a...
I just...
"The gun is
in the bedroom closet."
Thanks.
Mmm. I do, I do.
I do, I do.
Damn.
Spoon.
Hey, Blake.
Hey, did you
get my messages?
Mmm.
Okay, I got everybody
here with me right now.
I got Trip here,
everybody's here.
- Blakey, Trip here.
- What's going on at the house anyway?
Who's all over there?
What do you guys do all the time?
I mean, I call, I call, I call.
I finally get through to you
and now you're not
even talking to me.
Dude, I know
you're on the phone.
Anyway, so this tour is like...
this hasn't been easy, man.
- Don has been working his ass off...
- Don rocks, man!
...beating up promoters in Europe
trying to get the money that you want.
We all want to get on this,
trying to make it all work.
So if you need to go hide out
at the clinic, you can.
Whatever you need.
Let's just get this going, man.
Are you gonna play the tour?
That's what I need to know.
I'm assuming you're gonna play it.
We're ready.
Everybody here has
been working on it.
It's only 86 days,
so, it should go
pretty fast.
I mean, I thought this is
what you wanted, man.
Isn't this what you wanted?
It's gonna be a shame, dude,
if you don't
make these dates.
We're gonna have pissed off agents.
I'm gonna get yelled at.
Everybody's gonna...
the world's gonna fall apart on this.
You've gotta
play the days...
Rabbit.
- There's somebody here.
- Who is it?
It's Blake.
...you can.
Hm?
How are you, sir?
Thaddeus Thomas from Yellow Pages.
Who are you?
Thaddeus Thomas
from the Yellow Pages.
- Mmm.
- I just wanna make sure you're
represented in the book
which will be coming out shortly.
Hi. So how's
your day so far?
Mmm... pretty...
pretty good.
Not... not...
not, uh,
you know...
another day.
Okay.
Thaddeus Thomas again.
Your name again?
- Blake.
- Blake? Nice meeting you, Blake.
- Nice to meet you.
- Okay, great.
Well, we have some
great opportunities here for you
in the Yellow Pages.
And what
I would like to do
is just ask a couple of questions
about your business
and find out a little bit about
what your business needs are,
so that this will enable me
to build an effective ad
for the upcoming edition
of the Yellow Pages, okay?
Um, yeah.
Okay, great.
So, last year
you had...
you ran an ad and...
I ran an ad
last year?
Yeah, you ran
an ad last year.
This is for... you had a...
this is the locomotive shop,
- and you were selling parts for...
- Oh yes yes.
Right. And the ad
was successful?
Did you get a lot of replies
from that ad or...
I didn't, um...
l...
I think it was...
I think it was successful.
- Okay.
- I mean, it's kinda... it's kinda like...
- 'cause it, you know...
- Mm-hm.
Success is subjective,
you know?
- Right.
- It's not...
- Absolutely.
- It could be an opinion.
Mm-hm, but in terms
of people.
Obviously, you obtained
a lot of new customers
- as a result...
- Mm-hm.
...and sold a lot
of parts as well?
Yeah, we...
yeah,
we sold quite
a lot that year.
That's great,
that's great.
So what we're
going to do here is
- simply continue that process.
- Mm-hm.
So my next question
would be
do you plan
to open up another store,
another shop,
a different location?
Well, what do you plan
to do business-wise?
Well, actually...
I mean, we're just
sort of playing it by ear.
- We didn't really have any...
- Mm-hm.
- Except, you know,
thoughts about
opening other...
- Mm-hm.
...shops.
- Right right.
- Yeah.
Okay, so,
about employees...
you might hire
more employees?
Do you plan to expand
your business in any way?
- Okay?
- Yeah, dude.
- Just bugs.
- Okay, all right.
So based
on my records, Blake,
you are the sole
proprietor here.
You don't have
a partner, correct?
No, I don't have
any partners.
Okay, all right.
All right.
Well, I'm happy to hear that your ad
has been working successfully
and we're going to be
running the same ad...
one more time.
Okay?
You should achieve the same level
of success as well.
And the town of North Port
is exploding with business
and a lot of people are moving in
from around the country
because of the beauty...
you okay?
You're okay... for the beauty
and elegance of the city
and it's a very good place
to do business
and you'll be the benefactor
of that, right?
So what I would
like to do is
set up another meeting
with you, okay?
I just want to go
over some options
for different programs
that we have...
in the directory,
okay?
So for right now,
what I'm going to do
is leave my business card
with you, all right?
And I'll be coming back
on Tuesday at 1:00.
- Is that time good for you?
- Mm-hm.
Okay, so I want you
to hold onto this for right now
and I'll be here
at 1:00...
next Tuesday,
and at that point
I'll have a copy
of your ad
and I'll discuss
some additional programs
that I feel that you would
benefit from, okay?
Okay, very good.
All right, so it's been a pleasure, Blake,
meeting you,
and I hope to see you again
very soon, okay?
- Okay.
- I'll see you next Tuesday.
- All right.
- Have a good day.
All right. You...
you have a good day as well.
Okay, very good.
Take care.
I'm sorry, Blake.
Blake?
Okay.
Scott?
Scott.
- Hello?
- Hello. Hello, Lukas.
- No, it's not Luke. It's Scott.
- You fucking asshole,
- I need to talk to Blake.
- Look, he's the asshole, not me.
- Get him now. I need to talk...
- No, Blake is not here.
Don't fucking tell me he's not there.
He left rehab.
- None of us have seen him.
- This a bunch of bullshit.
Why are you making this so hard?
I just need to talk to him.
- Yeah.
- Fine, just get him.
Look, you just... just need to chill out.
Everything's under control here.
- Wow.
- Hello, my name's Elder Friberg.
My name's also
Elder Friberg.
We're from the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter Day Saints
- just down the road.
- Okay.
- How are you doing this morning?
- Good.
We were wondering
if we could come in
and tell you a little bit
about our church,
give you information
on our religion.
- This is a nice house.
- Thanks. You want a drink?
No, thank you.
Don't you, um...
the blood of Christ
thing?
No, we use water
instead of wine.
- Water for the blood of Christ?
- Yes.
The alcohol
in the wine is...
we believe is bad for our bodies,
so we don't...
drink anything that's bad
for our body.
Humph.
So have you guys had
anything really freaky
happen to you when you go
to these houses?
- Not really.
- Not normally.
And you're here
to convert us?
No, we're here just to give you
background information
on our religion
in hopes that you come
to one of our services.
Do you know anything
about our religion?
- No.
- No?
All right, I'll give you
some background information.
How it started is, uh...
a young boy by a...
at the age of 14,
wanted to know
which church to join,
because he noticed
there were so many.
So he knelt down
and he prayed,
and he said,
"As I prayed,
a pillar of light
descended upon me
and when that pillar
reached me,
I saw two figures
directly above me.
The figure
on the right said,
'This is my son,
Jesus Christ, hear him'."
God sent Jesus
to the earth
to be the most
pure being
to ever walk
the earth.
And he was sent
to be sacrificed
so that we didn't
have to sacrifice lambs
to be forgiven.
Now, all we have to do is ask
with a sincere heart to be forgiven.
Back then you couldn't talk to God
unless you were pure.
So by puri...
by killing something pure...
by sacrificing something
that was innocent,
you became innocent
yourself.
- Let me get a...
- Can you...
- can you talk to God now?
- Yes, when we pray.
- We've gotta go.
- You gotta go?
We have to go. We have
a lot of area to cover today.
We want 'em to stay,
right guys?
Is there a time
we can come back?
Blake?
Blake.
...when you come out,
because if you truly go...
if you truly go inside...
you know, if you
actually go there...
when you come out,
it can be
very frustrating.
Mmm.
Very...
I don't know,
it's just hard...
it's hard to speak
with other...
because you're speaking
like a different, uh...
Thank you
for your time.
Um, in the book...
- in the cover, there's scriptures...
- These?
Yes, and our phone number
if you have any questions.
- Thanks for the book.
- Thank you for having us inside.
- Nice to meet you.
- You have a good day.
Our number's in there
and if you could read
over the scriptures
and then give us a call
if you have any questions.
- All right.
- We have services on Sunday
from... at 9:00.
Um, okay.
You guys talk to Jesus for real?
Huh? Huh?
Then one day he thought the way
to make money...
there are a lot of...
a lot of people who had
exotic backgrounds in vaudeville.
There was a Chinese magician
named Ching Ling Foo
who was doing really well.
So Billy Robinson
sort of disappeared
and he resurfaced
as a Chinese magician
named Chung Ling Soo.
He had his hair cut off
and made into a queue...
you know, one of those long queues
at the back of his neck.
And he uh...
he had himself made up
to look like a Celestial.
And he became incredibly
well-known performing...
- Was he a prophet?
...in England.
No, he was a magician.
He was a stage magician.
- Oh.
- He did these really wonderful shows.
And the real
Chinese magician,
Ching Ling Foo, got
outraged and he tried
to have a competition with him.
There was headlines in the paper,
"Soo fools Foo,"
"Foo sues Soo."
You know, they had
this amazing rivalry.
Basically, the guy who wasn't
Chinese kind of won the contest,
as this great
Chinese magician.
The other thing he did...
he actually tried
to catch a bullet
in his teeth on the stage.
- What?
- And marksmen would get up.
They'd have
a bullet autographed.
I mean, you would nick with
your nail an initial into the bullet,
and a rifleman
would fire it at him.
And this Billy Robinson dressed up
as Chung Ling Soo would stand...
stand on the stage with a plate
in front of his mouth,
and the marksman would
fire the bullet.
And Chung Ling Soo would catch
the bullet in his teeth,
and then spit
the bullet onto the plate.
- You're shitting me.
- And they would check it.
And it would be the same mark that was
made by the guy in the audience.
- It was an amazing effect.
- Whoa.
It goes back
to the 16th century.
What was
that book called?
There was a book about it called
"The Riddle of Chung Ling Soo"
by a guy named
Will Dexter, but...
- I'll check that out.
- The thing that's amazing
is he's performing one day
at the Wood Green Empire Theatre,
you know,
in London in 1918.
And he's doing
this stunt...
they shoot him,
he drops to the ground
and he's dead. He actually dies
trying to catch the bullet
- in his mouth.
- No!
To this day, there's still
all sorts of speculation
about what really happened.
"Was it an attempt
to commit suicide?"
He had some rocky relationship
with his wife Dot,
who performed with...
under the name of Suee Seen.
But the thing I always
remembered about the case...
you know, being a P.I.
I guess is that
the Coroner's report
called it "misadventure."
"Death by misadventure."
Not bad.
- This is a great castle.
- Look at this stonework.
- Stonehenge.
- Well, not quite, is it?
No, but there's
a similar castle down
three miles from here
that has a replica.
Of Stonehenge?! They moved
the Salisbury Plain up here?
Just a replica.
Was built for like
the princess of Romania,
by this guy, Sam Hill Rockefeller.
That guy... that auto man
from Arizona... McCulloch
had the whole London Bridge
brought out to Arizona.
Yeah, same thing.
In 1831, there was this guy
who played his chin
at the opening of the bridge.
Michael Boai.
Played "Ladoiska,"
by Kreutzer.
The whole overture, man.
Sample that
for some music.
- Out.
- Yeah.
- Hey, man, have you seen Blake?
- No, I haven't seen him.
'Cause Blackie says
she hasn't seen him for a week.
- Who's this guy, man?
- Blackie told me to lead him around,
try to find him, 'cause she's
worried about him, actually.
Come back later
without him.
All right, man.
Um...
