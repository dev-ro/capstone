Oh God, it's too damn
cold out here.
- Hey, Francis.
- Hey, Pee Wee.
- You're back in town...
- Yes.
You... seen Helen around?
No.
I haven't seen her
in a couple of days.
Well, I'll catch up with her.
Hey, bum!
Hey.
You are looking good!
- Where did you get them shoes?
- Hospital.
I got the all schmutter
at the hospital.
Doctor say I got cancer.
First thing I ever got.
Cancer?
No shit!
He says "You gonna die in six months".
So I said, I would wine myself to death.
He says...
"It don't make no
difference whether you wine"...
You're dieing, you are gone"
Well, Grandma...
Too bad.
Do you have a jug?
I have a dollar.
Nurse...
A nurse gave me a dollar.
So are we in business.
Want to work with me today?
Get some money?
I had some last night,
but I blew it.
It is a jug, a place to sleep.
It will be cold tonight.
Naw, work where?
Up at the cemetery.
Shoveling graves.
A fellow told me
they was hiring people.
Beeing paid money or... they
give you a free grave when you croak?
If it ain't money, forget it!
I ain't shoveling out
my own goddamn grave.
I knew that guy Grogan when I was a kid.
He used to own all the electricity
in this town.
He ain't got much of it now.
Don't bet on it.
That kind of guys never give up
on a good thing.
Hey, buddy...
Looking for a special up there?
Maybe.
Do you want to be buried under
a stone like that?
I never knew no boom
buried under a gravestone.
I don't need me no stone.
As long as you don't have
to die alone.
You'll die first.
I'll send out the invites.
Hey, Gerald.
How are you doing, kid?
It's nice up here.
Pretty view across the creek.
I don't know if you know it
or not that...
You are up here with this...
Rest of the family?
Grandfather sleeps
four graves down.
Please God...
I'm sorry boy.
It was not because I was
drunk that I lost you.
I only drunk four beers
after I came home from work.
You slipped out of that diaper,
and your mother...
"Sweet Jesus"
Then I would snatch you up.
But we didn't touch you,
for you were so strange.
Brother Billy cames in and says
"Why is Gerald so crooked?"
Jesus Christ,
I remember everything.
I remember everything.
I even remember the red
and yellow squares in the linoleum...
Where you fell.
Hey, Franny!
Hey, Franny!
Trucks are here to take us back down.
Do you know somebody
who's buried up there?
Yes, a little kid.
What did he do, die young?
Pretty young, yes.
What happened?
He fell.
Fell where?
On the floor.
On the floor?
I fall about twice a day...
I ain't dead yet.
That's what you think.
So, where are we headed now?
Why do you care where
we are headed?
Got an appointment?
No.
You got tickets to the opera?
No.
I only want to know
where I am headed for.
You ain't known where you been heading
for 20 years.
Nobody's gonna oppose this.
Go by the mission and see
if anybody knows where Helen is.
- What's Helen's name?
- Helen.
What's her other name?
She has only got one name.
You don't want to tell me,
thas's all right.
Damn right it's all right.
You going to eat at
the mission tonight?
The priest gives out
pretty good food.
I had a bowl of soup over there yesterday
because I was starved...
But God, it was sour.
Them old bums are just hungry.
They don't believe in nothing.
I used to live around here
when I was married.
In that house, right there.
When was last time you were here?
22 years ago.
Who lives there now?
Some people I used to know.
The basball field is there yet.
I used to play there when I was a kid.
I was pretty good to throw.
What year was that?
I do not know.
1901.
When I was 5 years old.
How old are you now?
Eight?
We had a trolley strike that year.
Scabs!
Come on you scabs!
You see those folk ahead?
I don't want to hit anybody.
Get the scabs off that car!
He has got no right to run it!
You get off the track!
You take this car back
to the barns.
You won't get through here!
They busted his head!
I think you've killed him, Francis.
We better run!
Why did you kill me?
I didn't mean to kill you.
Was that why you threw that stone
that broke my skull?
My brains flowed out...
And I died.
Scabs get what they ask for.
Then you feel no remorse?
You dirty bastards.
Taking our jobs, keeping us
from feeding our family.
Odd logic, coming from a man who
abbandoned his own family?
You haven't been home in 22 years.
I dropped my...
baby son.
He died.
I couldn't face that.
A coward, you run!
You have no arguments to justify your deed.
By God I can!
By God I can!
What is it you can?
I sit here and argue with some
damned dead scab!
Why don't you please sit down?
No, I am no dead scab.
But you look like one.
Never mind the song,
just get the soup.
Now, I'd like to ask all you
lost and hopeless men
Who will give you a ride on
the turnpike to salvation?
Jesus will.
Jesus delivers.
Is there a man here
who wants a different life?
God says: Come on to me.
Take him at his word!
Come down in front now,
kneel and be saved.
All right, then.
Amen, brothers.
Amen!
Wake up, boom.
Soup time.
Pee Wee, Helen still don't come in? -
No.
And I have been here all the day.
I am glad to see you're
staying straight. Franny.
I believe that I got a job for you.
Why, I worked today
at the cemetery...
Splendid!
Well, shoveling there
ain't all that splendid.
Ah, maybe this one
is a better one.
Old man Rosskam, the ragpicker,
needs a helper.
If you are serious about staying off the
booze, you may put together a decent pay.
I'm gonna talk to him.
- I appreciate it.
- Fine.
I'll tell you what else I'd appreciate:
a pair of socks.
My own,
look like rats all ate it out
Dammit, where did you grow up,
in a barn?
Close the door!
It is cold here!
Where have you been Helen?
Oh fuck, you don't care
for anybody,
I could have been dead three times over,
you wouldn't have known a thing about it.
What the hell could I do
when you act like a goddam crazy
So who wouldn't be crazy around you
Spending everything we
get and drinking whisky.
God Francis, you are bad enough
with wine, but on whisky...
Aw... you're a devil.
I have 6 bucks.
Yeah?
Where did you get them?
Working all the damn day out at
the cemetery, shoveling graves.
Wonderful.
Wonderful.
Splendid.
And you're sober.
And you are eating.
Ye, and I ain't drinking neither.
Oh, that's so lovely!
I am proud of my good boy.
Try these on for size.
They are good and warm.
Just what I needed...
Thank you for 'em, Chester.
It's fine you're off the drink,
You got a strong look
about you today.
Naw, it's just a false face
for Halloween.
Do not run yourself down.
Keep faith.
How are you little lady?
See you're doing well.
- I'm perfectly delightful.
- Good.
I'm doing just fine and
I don't need any messages...
Don't fight, just take
the socks away.
For 6 dollars, we can rent a room and get
a few suitcases and the phonograph back.
Hey, you see who is in town Francis?
Oscar Reo.
Oscar Reo that used to sing
on the radio?
That's the fella.
He blew the big time on booze,
but he dried on intense by now.
And he killed his king.
I was in love with his voice
and I wrote him fan letters.
We flew and drank with him
down in New York, did't we Pee?
2-3 days wasn't it?
Most musical drunk I ever seen.
Ok folks, time to close up.
Francis...
Where do you plan to sleep tonight,
do you know?
The Weeds
Were did you sleep last night?
Finnys car?
No. Not in Finnys car, I will absolutely
not stay in that car another night.
I slept with Jack.
I thought you didn't like
Jack no longer...
- and Clara neither.
- Yeah.
They are not my favorite people.
You know, they gave me a bed
when I needed one.
Look at her.
Is she dead?
Hi, Sandra.
It's me, Rudy.
You dead, or just drunk?
She's just drunk.
She can't hold it no more.
- She seems a goddamned Eskimo.
- Yeah.
Whether she's an Eskimo or whether
she ain't, she'll freeze out here.
Dogs will come along
and eat her ass off.
Is she a bum or
just a plain drunk?
She's been a boom all her life.
Bum all her life...
She had to be something now
before she was a bum.
She was a wore you know, up in Alaska.
What about before that?
Well. I don't know.
I guess maybe she was
just a little kid.
All right... something.
A little kid something
ain't a bum.
It ain't a whore either.
Get up..
She'll freeze this night.
I slept out last night,
and it was cold.
I'm gonna give you a bowl of hot soup,
and you won't freeze out there.
Who are you?
Just a boom who'll
give you some soup.
Get me a drink!
Nope, I don't have money today.
She can't come in here.
Chester won't have her.
What are we supposed to do
with her, let her freeze?
You know him.
All right, goddammit...
Get her a bowl of hot soup...
And a blanket.
Franny...
The ambulance's boys
won't take her anymore.
Only if she is bleeding
to death.
Slit her throat
and they'll take her.
She doesn't want an ambulance,
she just wants to sleep it all away.
She will not even feel cold.
She's a cake of ice.
Even if you're drunk, it don't mean
you don't feel cold..
- Here's soup.
- Soup.
- You got a soup.
- A kind of soup, yeah
Here, have it.
Seems she doesn't want it.
She wants it, she's just plastered of wine.
She always... wanted to be
a nurse up in Alaska.
- Doctor.
- Oh, she wanna be a doctor.
The doctor wanted me
to be a nurse
And you didn't want that?
Yes.
But he died.
Ah... love.
Yes.
Love.
I can't look at it no more.
- God bless your voice.
- Thank you miss. Shall I get you a drink?
The beer looks tantalizing.
You said you would't drink.
I said no wine, no.
I think I know you two.
Well, I think you're right.
But you had
But you woudn't sport that turkey wig
last time I've seen you.
You guys got me drank in New York.
Time find thirst.
Francis Phelan,
and this here is Rudy the Kraut.
- Pleasure.
- He's okay, but he is nuts.
- My kind of fellow.
- Yeah.
Pee Wee Packer.
This her is Helen Archer.
She hangs out with me.
I'll be goddamned if I know why.
Take one of that yourself, Oscar.
No...
I don't drink anymore.
Me neither.
Oh, I ain't managed to turn it off yet.
I'm gonna wait till I retire.
To that wish.
You are a sport.
I can't tell you from
those swells over there.
Swells and bums...
It ain't no difference.
Except that swells want
to look like swells...
And bums want to look
like bums...
Am I right?
You are smart fellow.
That was such a...
Wonderful song that you sang.
I remember when you sang
out of the radio.
Oh, I used to sing a song myself.
A singer?
Where was that?
Oh, everywhere.
The concerts, and then I sang
every night on the air.
You should do us a tune.
Yeah!
No, that was...
I couldn't the way I look.
You look as good as
anybody in here.
Come on!
Flowers?
Yes. Please...
Now, she's gonna get
up there and sing...
You ain't to screw down
and garble, though.
Francis get a little money, and the first thing
he do is buy me roses, wouldn't you Fran?
- Sure would.
- Yeah, we were lovebirds then...
We had a beautiful apartment
upon Hamilton Street.
Goddamned dead men.
They travel around together.
- We are in flowers.
- Yeah.
When was that?
I don't remember
you had a place on your own.
'35 we was here 6 weeks.
No, no, it was more...
months...
We were here almost a year.
I can't recall one day I didn't...
He wouldn't stop drinking, and then
we couldn't pay the rent, you see?
So, we had to give up
my old Steinway piano, and...
and the heavenly china,
the very best you can buy.
"When you buy, buy the best,"
my father tought me that.
Why don't you sing us
a tune, Helen.
No!
- Sing us a tune.
- No, no.
Ye, ye, come on!
Well...
- Yeah!
- All right, yes!
Oh, well...
Listen...
Does your friend
know "He's Me Pal"?
He knows everything.
Eh? Yeah.
Well, people used to like
the way I sang it.
A real old time trouper
will now sing us a song
The lovely Miss...
Helen A... Helen Archer.
Helen Archer.
Yeah, ye!
I would like to say I sing it
for my man, Francis.
I know a lad, and when
I feel bad...
He scares all my
troubles away...
When he's your friend,
he is yours till the end...
No matter what others
may say...
He don't tell me
how I ought to be...
He likes me just as I am...
And when I feel blue,
he is the one I go to...
'Cause his heart is as big
as a ham...
He's me pal, he's me pal...
There's nobody else I can see...
I know he's dead tough,
but his love is no bluff...
He shares
his last dollar with me...
I 'd rather have him
with his 15 a week...
Than be some old
millionaire's gal...
He is the best ever was
and I loved him because...
He's me pal, he's me pal...
My pal is poor...
But I am dead sure...
He is better than most millionaires...
am I right?
I am satisfied
when he is by my side...
The joy and the sorrow
we share...
I'd give my arms
to keep him from harms...
He'd do the same thing for me...
He'll always be there
stormy weather or fair...
That's the reason I like him,
you see?
He's me pal, he's me pal...
There ain't nobody else I can see...
I know he's dead tough,
but his love is no bluff...
He shares his last dollar
with me... wouldn't you?
I 'd rather be his
with his 15 a week...
Than be some old
millionaire's gal...
He is the best!
And I loved him...
He's me pal...
He's me pal!
By God Helen, this is
as good as it gets.
You are born to be a star.
Oh, is this true?
He is the best ever was...
And I loved him because...
He's me pal...
He's me pal!
Thanks. Thank you.
Lovely, dear.
Thank you.
Mighty nice, old girl.
Not bad at all.
Have a glass on me.
'Tis a nice night
isn't it Fran?
Oh, yeah...
- Nice!
- Yeah!
The all night.
Hey!
Go away!
Get out of there!
Those animals are always here.
Damn!
Jesus Christ.
The worms are crawling,
the worms crawl out...
They crawl all over
your nose and mouth.
- Go away!
- Stay away from me!
I have the money!
They took the money!
They took the money!
Bastards!
Oh, Jesus...
How much was it?
15 dollars!
They got away.
15 dollars!
15 dollars, Francis!
Forget about the money.
We'll get more money tomorrow.
Oh, Jesus...
Don't worry about the money.
15 dollars Francis?
Where did you get 15 dollars?
- Your son Billy gave them to me.
- Goddamn woman and your sneaky ways!
Don't you make hassle!
Sandra is dead.
I'll bet she prayed to die.
Her life wasn't human any more.
I want to go in church
in the morning.
Good.
What am I gonna do
with you now?
Hey!
You can stay here.
The beds are full, but
you can sleep on a bench.
- I'd rather not.
- Thanks Pee Wee.
Of course we can go to Jack.
He told me I could came back.
Yeah, come back any time he says...
Well, shag then, woman.
You'll take care
of Sandra, Pee Wee.
What was the last name?
Never heard it.
Don't matter now.
Never did.
Rudy...
I went to Gerald's grave today.
So?
You did?
That was the first time,
wasn't it?
Right.
Yeah, you been thinking about him
this days, I know.
I meant it's tough
to think about him.
Went the grave, and talked to him.
And talked to him!
How did you talk to him?
I stood there and talked
to the grass.
Well, I am getting nuts as Rudy.
No, you're not nuts, dear Francis.
'Tis the back of the town years.
No...
It ain't that.
Something Billy said.
I haven't told you, Helen.
He says...
Annie never told...
Anybody that it was me
dropping the kid.
She never told who?
The police?
Nobody.
Not Billy, not Peggy.
Nobody in the family.
Ain't that something?
I can't believe a woman...
Gone through all that stuff...
Not to tell anybody...
Oh, if that's a pebble
on your mind, I mean...
Maybe you ought to go see them.
Oh, that wouldn't help nothing.
Get it out of your system.
Dead sons of bitches.
You be friendly.
What the hell's you
weeping about?
Just everything that
happens to me.
Come on!
At least you had to sing a song.
Yes, that I sang.
I sang, while Sandra was
dieing up there.
She was gonna die anyway.
Her time was up.
No, no, I don't believe that.
I believe you die when you
can't stand it anymore.
You take as much
as you can, and you...
You die...
when you can.
Now...
It's as good a saying as there is.
- You die when you can.
- Yeah!
I am glad we agree on something
for once.
Well, we get along all right.
But we haven't got a penny
or a place to sleep.
- No!
- We are on the bottom!
That's for sure.
Come on, let's go over to Jack,
before he turns the lights out on us.
Hey, Jack.
Come by to see you.
Chances of a bum getting a drink?
It's cold for October.
They're calling for snow.
Feel my hands.
This is my home!
I ain't a fawn to feel your hands!
Your head neither!
I don't see any snow.
I had a bowl of soup at six o'clock,
but it disappeared.
I must have something to eat.
I don't care whether
he's eaten or not.
What about a soda pop, Helen?
What?
Yes, sure Jack.
What kind of soda?
You know.
The one for your kind.
You...
You feeling better... Clara?
No.
What's wrong with your shoe?
Have a piece of twine there.
I got a shoelace.
I ain't put it in yet.
Then put it in!
This sweater...
- You know where it is?
- Don't harass me.
Find it...
and put it in.
You're nagging.
You're what?
I am not nagging,
I don't like to do that.
Let me ask you a question.
No.
You said no,
what do you mean... no?
What's he gonna ask?
Find out what he's gonna ask.
How's everything been going?
I always thought you were
an intelligent man, Fran.
But you can't be.
The way you drink.
- You could be a charming man.
- That's right!
You could have 20 dollars
in your pocket at all times.
Yeah, I told him that.
If I had 20,
I'd spend it all on her.
Oh, sure!
I don't want her sleeping
down on the weeds.
The weeds!
I have never gone
that far down.
It is not that far to go.
She slept in Finnys
car last night.
No, that was two nights ago,
and that was the last time.
If it comes to that again,
I will simply get in touch with my people.
My people are very high class.
You really ought to get in touch
with them, dear Helen.
You ought to get straight, Fran.
They need men like you.
You can get yourself a Victrola
like that one.
Would that not be good?
I've had all that shit.
If you don't shape up, you'll die.
You be right, Jack.
May I use your bathroom?
Help yourself.
Remember that tune, hotshot?
Poor little lamb, now his fleece
has gone cold...
Wakes up in the morning alone...
Poor little lamb knows
what's coming...
Life is an empty cup...
So let's go on a bummer...
Who was this guy
who didn' make it?
Some ginny horse thief.
What they chasing you
for a vice?
I forgot to shine my shoes
this morning.
So let's go on a bummer...
This summer...
Where we won't have to be afraid...
The world will be on a hummer, boys...
And we'll laugh and
we'll drink lemonade.
Lemonade...
Lemonade...
I used to sell it out at the ball park
when I was a kid...
When I first started hanging out
with the older fellows.
Playing ball.
Windy Evans used to play in jockstrap
and catched flies behind his back.
A great ball player.
Hey! Where did you get
them shoes from?
I found them.
Goddammit, them nice shoes.
That's why I wear 'em.
Poor little lamb
now his fleece is all cold...
Wakes up in the morning alone...
Poor little lamb
knows what's coming...
Life is an empty cup.
Poor little lamb
watch your shoulder...
I'm gonna cut off
your goddamn feet!
I'm real sorry that I hurt you so bad...
But I had good reasons.
You know?
I almost lost a finger.
I couldn't do anything right-handed
for a long time.
But...
I don't hold no grudges
for more than 5 years.
See you.
Thanks for what you did.
Francis, are you
all right in there?
Who are you talking to?
Who are you talking to?
I think about the time
an old bum... froze.
Foxy Phil Tooker...
Poor guy froze...
All scrunched up with red icicles
coming out of his nose.
The didn't even bother
straightening him out.
They just buried him
in half a coffin.
Hey, bum.
How about me having a drink?
I ain't no bum.
I know you ain't, goddammit!
You are a good man!
Working man.
I knew a sod once
that was so much like Francis.
All had our hearths for him.
I'll bet you did.
Clara never likes her boyfriends.
She is pretty sick.
That's the why you can't stay.
Let me tell you something:
I have listened
to a lot of crap...
You are drunk, Francis!
Stay drunk
for the rest of your life.
I'm really leaving you now!
What do I do with this woman?
Oh, it's late!
Yes, people...
I got to hit the hay.
Make me a sandwich.
To go.
- No!
- You!
You forget when you were hungry,
you came to my place begging for food!
I never...
He asks only for a sandwich.
All right!
Go and make him a sandwich!
Sharp cheese!
You like sharp cheese?
My favorite.
- Good night, pal.
- Best of luck.
See you around.
Now we're in hell, you...
That's the answer
they've given me, but...
She wasn't so sick, I say...
And in a hurry with you with quarreling.
And always broke!
I had to speak my
mind, that's all.
As it accomplished anything..
Here. Have a piece.
It would choke me.
It won't choke you!
- You'd be glad for it.
- I am not a phoney.
I am not a phoney either.
Hey, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do!
I'm not even going to cross
that goddammned street!
Now be a goddamned woman!
That's why you can't find
nowhere to sleep!
I asked for a sandwich,
did I get it?
Yes, you are supremest and powerful.
Don't you shift your eyes at me or I'll
knock you across the goddamned automobile!
You have been a pain in the ass
for 9 years.
Jack told me that I could stay.
But you can't because you are a pain
in the ass, they don't want you.
- Now I eat that sandwich.
- Why didn't you?
And I'll be thankful.
For everything.
You are a perfect saint.
It is as wet!
You are a woman to abuse...
I warned you: it's dog food.
I'll feed you!
Don't drive me insane! Be a goddamned woman
and find a fucking bed to sleep!
Stay away!
I'll call my brother.
Do it!
Why don't you call him twice,
so he can hang up on you again, he?
Where are you going to get
the nickel for the call?
Well, that's my business,
God's paying!
You were all right before
you started on the wine.
Why? Why? Why?
I want to get some cardboard.
We gonna go down at that old building.
No, I am going down below.
Oh, you can't.
You got nowhere to go.
You want to smacked get over the head?
That was the worse...
you never hit me before!
I'm not gonna hit you.
I love you, someways.
And don't go walking away
from me
You'd be lost in the world.
- You are so cold?
- Yes, yeah...
I couldn't stay out tonight, Francis.
I would die.
- Finny!
- Oh!
- There are visitors
- Who the hell is it?
Francis. Pull over.
Make room for Helen.
- You get a jug for this buddy.
- Yes, sure.
- Don't be afraid.
- Oh, it's not that..
Oh, she's been here before!
See you here in the AM,
or I'll meet you up at the mission.
Why do not you just get in, too?
No, there's no legroom.
Keep the faith.
Oh, I may not sleep for moment.
I can only pray to God...
Aw, aw, aw, don't touch me here,
it hurts too much.
I'm here to talk, you see.
Forgive me,
forgive me for I have sinned.
Let's call it a sin,
though I call them decisions.
I am not a drunk, not a whore,
and I've never let a man use me money.
You know, I went dots
lots of times, and I...
Well, I would let them
buy the drinks, but...
That's because men want
to buy the drinks.
And I never...
Ever betrayed anybody.
That's what comforts me.
Of course I know...
I know living with Francis
was sinful in the eyes of some people...
I took a certain amount of liberty
with the commandments.
But nobody is gonna compell me either
to declare to anybody...
Not even you St. Joseph, that loving
Francis was simple.
'Cause it was probably...
The greatest...
Thing in my life.
That's all.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Preacher said you were
looking for a strong back.
Could be.
You have got one maybe?
Pick up that barrel.
Do you pick up stuff
like this yourself?
Oh, yeah.
I do a liftime of lifting.
I pay you 7 dollars,
and work till dark.
Back work, it ought
to be 8-9 dollars.
Families eat for whole week on 7 dollars.
- 7.50.
- 7.
All right, what the hell...
Get up the wagon.
Ira!
- Would you like the rest of this toast?
- Yeah.
It's good toast,
but I can't eat a thing, now.
A friend wanted to give me
a cheese sandwhich last night...
Not a chance!
Come on, giddap!
How do you like it?
Like what?
Sex with this woman stuff.
I don't think about
it that much anymore.
To tell you the truth,
I'm over the hill.
Over the hill?
How old are you? 62?
Not that old.
I am 71 here.
I don't go over no hill.
4-5 times a night,
I get it with the old woman.
And in the daylight, I go
house to house, I get offers.
I never went house to house.
Has been half my life I go
house to house...
And I know how it is.
You get offers!
Boy, oh boy, you get offers!
Rags!
Rags!
My dear, you can stay
as long as you read.
But don't end up sleeping.
I wasn't sleping.
I was waiting for the fire...
To die.
Helen?
- Helen Archer?
- Yes.
It's Nora, Helen.
Nora Lawlor.
I havn't seen you in 20 years.
Nora? Of course.
Well.
How are you?
I heard you on the radio,
but then I lost track.
What have you been doing?
Well, I went on concert tour,
as a pianist.
And then I was abroad for years.
Living in Paris and Vienna.
And everywhere.
How exciting, what an exciting life!
I envy you Helen, I really do.
I never go anywhere.
Are you staying with your brother
while you are here?
Well, I suppose.
We have are very close.
I saw him in church
only last week.
In church?
Immagine that!
I go past his home all the time.
Hypocrit! What's he
doing in church after what he did to me?
- What?
- Don't you know?
He and my mother stole all the money
that father left me.
- No!
- Oh yes. I fight!
For 15 years they hid the will.
I am sorry, but you have to leave now.
I am sorry, but you make much to much...
I wanted to be free, and...
Hey! I have had it....
Stop for it!
All right!
I got even!
I mustn't with the pick out there.
Thieves they were,
only thieves anyway.
Thieves, thieves!
Thieves!
Thieves!
They were thieves!
When I found the will,
she just laughed at me.
That's right!
After I left, your loving son took
a good deal of it, didn't he mother?
You were a peacock, weren't you?
Where is the plumage now, mother?
Your old feathers!
Where did the plumage
go then, ha?
Where did the plu...
Rags!
Rags!
Yo-ho!
Ragman!
On the back porch.
Papers, a wash tub and
some old clothes.
I don't wanna go in.
I know her.
So what then?
I was born on this street.
I don't want people I know
see me looking like a bum.
- But you are a bum.
- You and me know that, but they don't know.
I'll cary anything you want
next time we stop.
A sensitive bum...
I have employed a touchy boom.
A sensitive bum I got working for me.
- Mrs Dougherty?
- Are you all right?
I'm going downtown, Francis.
- Shouldn't you put up some clothes?
- Clothes?
- Do you think I'm insane, Francis?
- Not exactly, madam.
- To whom have you mentioned my spells?
- No one, madame.
No one?
May I ask why?
Well...
People with no clothing is not something
I would talk about, ma'am.
Please don't call me madam.
Makes you sound like a servant.
Call me Katrina.
I couldn't.
I couldn't get it out.
But it's my name!
Say it. Say Katrina.
Katrina.
So there, you've gotten it out.
You know...
A great poet once said...
That love enter through the eyes.
One must be careful
not to see too much.
Have you seen anyone faint?
No.
Well, I shall faint for you,
dear Francis.
You done that pretty good!
You can get up now.
Hey bum, came here!
Sorry.
I would like to buy this shirt from you.
Take 25 cents for it?
Why does a bum
need a clean shirt?
Clothes make the man, they say.
A tidy bum...
A sensitive, tidy bum
I got on my wagon.
You love music, don't you.
It's the greatest thing
there's in this life, you know?
We ought to be willing
to die for music.
What does she mean, mamie?
She believes she might be able to
play the latest tunes, dear.
Just like you are doing.
Giddap, giddap.
Rags!
Rags!
I think I'm gonna get off
little ahead.
To see some people that
I haven't seen in a long time.
Of course I want my pay now.
You quit before dark?
I worked 7 hours, must be.
No lunch.
Take a dollar off for that.
That'd be fair.
25 cents for the shirt...
5.75.
A half-day work you get
half pay. 3.50.
I am the boss.
Yes, you're the boss.
You one strong fellow too.
But I know when I'm getting skinned.
This hand has seen it all.
Threats, hu?
Threats I don't like.
5.25. That's all I pay.
5.75 is fair.
You got to be fair in this life.
5.
75.
A bum is a bum.
You, I don't like.
Well...
I sort of liked you.
And, I ain't half bad
once you get to know me.
Giddap!
Excuse me, lady.
You know where I can get
a nice little turkey?
What did you say to my wife?
I asked her where
I could get a turkey.
What for?
Well...
My duck died.
Just keep moving, bud.
Got you.
- I ain't seen you much.
- Yes, Francis has got a job.
We are soon to take
an apartment too.
You're back in the church.
Francis is coming in tonight?
He may be and may not be.
It all depends on his work and how...
How busy he may or may not be.
I get it.
Put ​​them on the bed there, Donovan.
Ah, 6 dollars for the bags
and 1 dollar for the room.
- The same room and same bed.
- I'll pay you for two days.
Hope I don't die tonight.
You wanna eat some?
I am making coffee.
Oh, no, no coffee.
Thank you, Donovan.
Yes?
Howdy.
I...
I brought you a turkey.
Turkey?
4.5 pounds, I....
Billy said to come by
this Sunday and I...
I know it ain't Sunday, but I...
I came by anyway.
Is that you, Fran?
- It ain't one of those men from Mars.
- Oh. my God!..
My God, my God... My God.
Hi Annie, how you doing?
- You looking great.
- This is a surprise.
Here, here. It's freezing.
Freezing me up.
You stay, while I fix it?
Come in.
Come in.
Come in.
Sit down,
I'll get it in the oven.
Danny can go take cranberries.
- Who is Danny?
- Peggy's boy.
He's in the 4. grade.
He's smart as cracker.
Gerald would be 22.
I...
Saw his grave yesterday.
And I...
I talked to him.
I told him a lot of stuff.
I bet he was glad to hear from you.
Maybe. Maybe.
Tell me about Bill.
How is he doing?
He's a gambler.
Not a very good one.
He told me that you...
Never told nobody about
how I lost my grip...
On Gerald.
Not till the other day.
Starting it again
by talking about it?
It wasn't your fault...
anymore than it was my fault.
No way that I can thank you
for that, Annie.
Oh please... I just think,
don't touch something like that...
Never mind that.
Tell me... what is it that
made you come see us?
Why...
Let say that it was...
Billy invited me to come by.
I never thought I'd get invited.
Billy said you had a wife.
No. No.
Not a wife.
I've only have had one wife.
And I only have had one husband.
I only had one man.
It's religion.
It wasn't only religion.
I never could marry again, Annie.
But I have lived with Helen...
9 years, on and off.
She nursed me when I was sick as a pup.
She is a damn good woman.
Where is she now?
Downtown someweres, you know,
she's like a little kid, she...
She's gonna drop dead on the street some
day, if she keeps wandering off like that..
She needs you.
What do you need, Fran?
I think I...
I need a shoe-lace.
I am so awful sorry, Annie.
There are things to say, you know.
Lousy things, lousy.
Lousy things.
I never stopped loving you
and the kids.
Not that it entitles me
to nothing, you know.
I don't want nothing.
But my life is just...
Memoring things, here.
Elbows on the table.
I don't want nothing,
just a cup of tea...
And a sandwich.
Do you still make the irish
breakfast tea?
Yes.
Danny...
This is your grandfather.
He came to see you,
and he's staying for dinner.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Come from school?
- Are you Phelan or Quinn?
- Phelan. Francis Aloysius Phelan.
You could dip leader.
You played with the Washington Senators.
Billy says you taught him
to throw a curveball.
- Oh he remembers that, does he?
- Will you teach me?
Yeah, sure.
Get a baseball, I'll show you.
You know...
You, ha...
Hold your fingers across the seam.
Like that.
See?
Then you snap.
Snap.
You know? Like this.
That's right.
You'll see how nice
it will check for you.
Yeah.
Let's go out to try it.
I'll get another glove.
Annie...
You wouldn't by a fluke...
Have my old glove around, would you?
Oh, there's a old trunk of your things
up on the attic.
Maybe you want to have a look at it.
You saved my stuff?
No point throwing things away.
Come on, Billy, grandpa's here
Hey Bill.
How have you been getting on?
You made it.
I would have bet against
that happened.
You'd have lost.
I brought a turkey.
We are having it for dinner.
Do you like turkey?
Who the hell don't like turkey?
You can use my razor...
In the bathroom,
if I want to shave.
Don't be telling people
what to do.
Danny.
Most of my life
is in this picture.
Half the neighborhood turned up
for that ball game.
There's your great-grandfather.
Old Iron Joe.
And that's me.
Handsome, that one.
Some people thought so.
Some didn't.
Yeah.
Look at this in the light.
It is somewere...
Ty Cobb signed it.
1911, the year he hit 420.
He was a mean guy, Cobb.
He came at me many times
with his spikes up.
But he was the best.
Better than Babe Ruth?
Better and tougher...
And meaner...
And faster.
But less home runs
like the Babe though.
Would you like to have the ball?
Sure I would! Sure!
Who wouldn't?
Then have it.
But you better look Cobb up.
See?
I remember this suit.
You wore it for dress-up.
Yeah, I wonder if it'd still fit me.
Take it downstairs and press it.
I'll carry the glove.
All right, carry the glove.
That's Danny's room.
It's a nice, big room.
It gets the morning light.
It's nice.
What if I did drink
too much wine?
Whose's business is that?
Who knows how much
I didn't drink, ha?
Do you have a place
to stay tonight?
Sure.
I always got a place to stay.
Do you want to come home,
Franny, then?
I thought about it.
I admit that.
But I see it wouldn't work out.
Stranger things have happened.
Name one.
You to cemetery...
talking to Gerald...
It's nice up there where he is.
There's a grave there for you.
Right by that stone...
One for me,
two for the children.
You bought me a grave
after I run off?
You're part of the family.
Peg, well...
She's kind of bitter
about you staying away.
I was too, for years.
But that's over now.
I don't want no fight with Peg.
I can't say nothing
that means anything.
I know...
It's hard what you are doing
But that is something Danny has always
known about, and Billy...
He was glad to help you,
but he doesn't say it.
He had a... bum out of jail.
You are so mean to yourself.
Hell, I'm mean to
everything and everybody.
You goddamned spooks!
You aren't real, you're dead!
Or if you ain't, you ought to be.
I'd rather be dieing out in the weeds,
than stand here watching you pining away.
I am the one who's living!
I am the one who put you
on the map!
You don't know nothing
that I don't know!
See?
So get your asses gone!
I am sick and tired
of looking at you anyway.
Fran...
Annie...
I'd eat all the dirt
in this yard for you...
And all the weeds, and all the
dogbones too, if you asked me.
I think you probably
ate all that already.
How're you doing, Margaret?
I'm doing fine.
No thanks to you.
Let's give the man a break,
for Christ's sake...
He just got here.
What break did he ever give me?
Or you?
You don't just pop up here one day
and all's forgiven.
I don't expect any big forgiveness.
I am way past that.
So why you come back here like a gost
and force this scrawny turkey on us?
It's 12.5 pounds!
Why did you come here
is what I want to know?
This is a home
you didn't build.
Built you.
Built Bill.
You helped to.
- I wish you never did.
- Shut up
Riding time and years.
Shut that the hell up!
He only came to visit.
I asked if he wanted to stay,
and he said no.
So that's all to say?
Nothing to decide.
Like your mother says...
I'll be going on.
Hay, that's good!
You got the feelings of
a goddamn rattlesnake!
Oh you pardon me!
Pardon me...
For having any feelings at all.
A tough lady.
She'll come down.
How about the boy?
- Did you hear that?
- No.
He's out playing with the ball
and the glove that you gave him.
I given him the ball, not the glove.
Glove is yours.
It ain't much the glove
compared to today but...
If you want to give
to him, go ahead, but I...
I've always always thought
I'd give that old glove to Bill...
So he could say he had something
from the bigs around the house.
The turkey smells nice.
I bought you this plumpudding.
Mama says that you like it
for dessert.
Thank you.
It's nice that you remember that.
I...
Got a letter here, that...
Come to me up in Canada...
When I was playing ball
in Toronto.
You would you like to hear it?
"Dear papi."
"I suppose you never think you have
a daughter waiting for a letter."
I was so mad, that I was going
to join a circus.
"I hope you have good luck
with the team."
"Mama has 14 little,
little chickens out"...
"And there's a wild west show coming"
Wont you come
home and see it?"
"Billy is just going to bed"...
"And mama is watching me."
"Do not let me find you
with another girl"...
"For I will pull her hair."
"Yours truly"...
"Peggy."
You know it's funny, I don't remember
writing that.
Probably much you don't
remember about them days, you know...
You were only 9 years old.
Yeah.
I remember Toronto... in 1913.
We had one ump named Bates.
It was getting dark...
And he wouldn't call the game, because he is
in with the other club and we are winning.
So, Pudge Howard, who's catching
For a sess of three way confab
on the mound...
With me and High Pockets Wilson,
who was pitching for us.
Then Pudge squats down
behind the player, you know...
High Pockets lets go with a blazer,
Poom! Right down to Paddy...
"Ball"... Says the ump.
Well, if that's a ball, I'm gonna eat it
Pudge tells him.
And he answers:
well, get eat it.
Pudge takes the ball and...
Takes a bite out of it like this,
Of course, it ain't a ball at all,
It's a yellow apple like this
that I had given him on the mound.
Bates goes down in history as "Old Blindy Bates",
who can't tell a baseball from a yellow apple.
- Great stuff out there in them days.
- Yeah
Great stuff happened all the time.
I do believe that turkey
should be ready.
Hey.
Hey!
Wake up, your crazy Kraut.
Is that you, Franny?
No.
Buffalo Bill.
- I'm looking for the indians.
- The indians?
You... have seen...
- Helen?
- No.
Where did you get
the new suit, man?
- Up a tree.
- Up a tree!
Goddammit that isn't true, man!
Every lousy lie and
hand-painted thing I told is true.
Look at you!
New suit!
Look at me.
I look like a goddamned bum.
You are a bum.
Do you know why...
You know why people
call you a bum?
That makes them feel better
when they say it.
Oh, the truth can't hurt you..
If you're a bum, you're a bum.
Oh my God pray...
There must be a God...
That protects us bums.
Look at me.
Pray...
Almost killed myself.
You ain't intelligent enough
to kill yourself.
Hey.
Hey!
How you doing Andy?
Hotel open?
OK Francis!
You strike it rich?
Oh yeah, here...
Blue beget your soul.
All right!
This is Rudy the Cootie.
He says he's gonna kill himself.
I got me a form of a cancer.
It ain't nothing wrong with you that
little work, isn't gonna fix, buddy.
The cops was in here tonight...
Shining in their lights...
Didn't come in.
The cops who out and did that, they ought
to fix the goddamned houses down here.
I fell through the floor
last week.
I could have broke my neck.
Did you break it?
If I broke my neck
I'd be dead, wouldn't I?
You are alive, is that it?
You ain't dead?
You wise guy.
Well, Charles Darwin he is dead.
Master of botany.
He died in 1936.
He ​​was born of two midwives.
What's he supposed
to be talking about?
He ain't talking about nothing.
He's just talking.
Hey!
Hey, give us a sip of that ouch.
My leg is killing me.
I got TB.
TB?
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry for anybody
who got TB.
You know that sir Isaac Newton?
You know what he done
with the apple?
I know that.
He discovered gravity.
Do you know when that was?
1936!
- God, he's screwed!
- Born of two midwives!
He drives me nuts
with all his jammer.
Hey!
Who's giving orders around here?
On the big candy mountain...
Where cops have wooden legs...
Bulldogs all have rubber teeth...
And the...
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs.
Oh, shut up you goddamn idiot!
Shut the fuck up!!
Godamn, you got me buddy,
you got me.
I don't like you when they
gets you in an upproar.
One has to be nice!
When I leave this earth...
It want it to be with
the blessing of everybody.
The mockingbirds will sing
when you die, Francis.
What's that?
The guy there behind the shed
has got a baby.
A baby?
I had a little kid.
Broke his neck and died
13 days old.
And I am the one
who dropped him.
22 years ago.
My wife never told a soul
that I did it.
22 years she kept this secret...
Protecting a bum like me.
You can't fake with women.
My old lady told me I was the only man
that ever touched her.
When I came home one day,
she's banging two guys at once.
I'm talking about a real woman,
not some trash barrel whore.
My wife was good-looking, though.
She had a terrific personality.
Yeah.
All in her ass.
Screw you guys.
I should't told you nothing.
Hey Franny...
You know where that Milky Way is?
I's right up over there.
You know...
On the outskirts I...
I am restless person.
I'm a traveler really...
On the big...
Candy mountain...
No change of socks...
Those streams around...
Go trickling down the rocks...
On the big candy mountain...
On the big candy mountain...
Get the hell out of here...
Raider! Raider!
There! Get up! Come on!
Wake up! Wake up! Raider!
Raider! Raider! Raider!
How're you making it, pal?
He is dead, sir.
What was his name?
Sir?
Sir, what was his name?
Rudy.
Name was Rudy.
Rudy what?
Rudy Newton.
He knew where
the Milky Way was.
That's what he knew.
Helen.
Please Lilly...
Hey.
Hey.
Now is that..
Round and round, baby.
I...
It's nice...
You found all our stuff.
It looks nice.
Pretty.
Mighty pretty...
Old girl.
Mighty pretty...
I'm gonna come back...
Sooner or later.
I'm gona get you...
The gravestone...
That you always wanted.
You know what
I'm gonna put on it?
"Helen Marie Archer."
"Courageous soul."
What do you need, Fran?
Oh...
I ain't fussy.
A turkey sandwich
would do me just fine..
I've always wanted that... tea.
That's Danny's room.
It's a nice big room.
It gets the morning light.
Nice...
The room has got some space to it.
We can set up an extra cot.
It's a mighty nice room.
Is the morning light.
