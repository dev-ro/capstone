It's a funny thing.
No matter how low you sink,
there's still a right and a wrong.
You always end up choosing.
You go one way
so you can try to live with yourself.
Or go the other
and still be walking around.
But you're dead
and you don't know it.
I was coming through Texas
on my way to Mexico.
I needed some time to hide out.
I had spent
most of my life on the dodge.
Drunk or sober,
I got no complaints.
Even if I did get my hands dirty
on the way.
Jericho.
It was a jerkwater town
maybe 50 miles from the border.
Dirt streets,
ramshackle buildings...
And one thing for sure,
you couldn't find it anywhere on the map.
For the most part,
I was a big-city guy.
I like pavement under my feet
and bright lights after the sun goes down.
I figured this old burg
was just the kind of place you gassed up
the car, got something to eat.
If you got stuck,
maybe spent a night.
Then I got a look at her.
That's when all the fun started.
It's not a good idea to be looking
at Mr. Doyle's girl that way.
I remember a guy once told me
this is a free country.
Jacko. This guy thinks
it's a free country.
Now you're free to go.
Sheriff's office is right over there
in case you wanna complain about anything.
Your light's out.
I seen it.
Right outside the window.
You know
what I'm gonna do about it?
Not a goddamn thing.
But I know
what you ought to do.
You ought to get your spare,
put it on your car...
and just drive on out of town.
Ain't that right, Bob?
Hm. You gotta forgive Old Bob.
He ain't much for talk.
Oh, hold it.
Let me tell you something.
If you're really planning
on sticking around...
don't be coming to me for help.
You're on your own here.
We already got a fella in the window
of the undertaker.
Do yourself a favor.
First thing, get a firearm.
First customer I seen all week.
Want a whiskey or beer?
Don't have much else to offer.
Whiskey.
What happened to Prohibition?
Oh.
We don't pay
much attention to it here.
- You got a phone in this place?
- Who you wanna call?
My mama.
Sure. We got phones.
But they ain't workin'.
Since you gotta have a switchboard
operator to run 'em.
- You got electricity?
- Yeah. Got that. Runs on gas generators.
Hope they stay workin'.
Nobody left to fix 'em
if they go bust.
To tell the truth...
most of what they call decent folks
been run off.
Really ain't much left here
but a ghost town.
Some damn sheriff.
Making a profit just stayin' in the middle
grafting off both sides.
I think Mr. Doyle bought him off first.
Or maybe it was Strozzi.
- Who's Strozzi?
- Hm.
That's the other gang here.
Strozzi and the Italian fellas.
Both gangs took over this town.
Run off all the regular folks.
Come from the same big city.
They don't like each other much.
Bootleggers.
You got Strozzi at the Sweetwater
and Doyle's bunch down at the Alamo.
They leave me be
because I stay to myself.
They think I'm crazy.
What the hell are you doin'?
Gonna go see the fellas
who wrecked my car.
Have a little talk with 'em.
I hadn't gotten a real warm reception...
but I started thinking
maybe this was my lucky day.
A crook for a sheriff
and two bootlegger outfits
that hated each other.
If I played it right, I could make
some easy money and move on.
Ma'am.
I thought I made it real clear
who you can and can't be
lookin' at around here.
That's Mr. Doyle's property.
I came here to see you.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Did you get
that car of yours fixed yet?
I'm runnin' a little low on cash.
I was wondering if you could maybe
help pay the damages.
I guess maybe
you'll have to kill me.
It'll hurt if I do.
Tell Mr. Doyle if he had hired smarter guys,
none of this would've happened.
It's all about booze.
Gets smuggled through here from Mexico.
We're a part of a family operation
in Chicago.
So what we got here
is close to a civil war.
Except now we got a truce.
What's my guess?
This truce ain't gonna last.
Especially after Hickey gets back.
That's why you're here.
Who's Hickey?
Hickey is Doyle's right-hand man.
He's a sweetheart, this guy.
Looks like somebody carved him up
for a Sunday dinner.
Talks like this.
Forget it.
What about you?
You got a name?
Huh?
- Smith.
- Smith. What? Smith what?
- What, you got a first name?
- John.
John Smith.
- John Smith. All right.
- That's a good one.
You on the run, huh?
Where you from, Mr. Smith?
Back east.
John Smith from back east.
All right.
I heard that
you wanted to see me.
Yeah, that's right.
What's the matter?
What, did I interrupt something important?
She was doin' her nails.
Well, this is Lucy.
Yeah, she's a real nice girl.
She a real pretty girl.
She got big mouth,
but she's gonna keep it shut
and act very friendly now, right?
Lucy, would you please
take Mr. Smith to his room?
So I guess Strozzi hired himself
another bum.
- You got it all figured out, do you?
- Yeah. I'm a fortune teller.
Don't worry.
Working for Strozzi has its advantages.
You're gonna love your room.
The skirt was from
just outside of Cicero.
Strozzi told me he had her sent down here
to keep up his morale.
It was the first time
I ever heard it called that.
But try and keep it down up here, okay?
My room's right underneath.
I'll try not to make too much noise
when I'm jumping up and down on the bed.
Sunday dinner was a real event.
Strozzi might've been
a small-time crook,
but he tried to run things like he was
somebody important back in Chicago.
He had an army of 20 shooters.
As far as I could see,
most of them were goofballs.
It was all
right out of some dime novel.
You don't like pretty girls, huh?
- How's the food?
- Good.
Huh?
I brought these mamas in from Chicago.
Food here is terrible.
It's good, huh?
- Yeah. I like garlic.
- All right.
- What is this? Nobody waits?
- You're late.
- I had important business too.
- While you were doing
your important business,
things are happening.
We now have a new employee.
Mr. Smith, this is Giorgio Carmonte.
He killed Finn.
That's Doyle's best guy next to Hickey.
No!
I know all about it.
- And you hire him?
- Yeah.
Yeah, what do you think that looks like
to Doyle in keepin' the truce?
You wanna tip Doyle off?
Plus, who the hell is 'e?
Doyle's guys are scared o' him.
Hey, hell, he was in town
20 minutes, he killed one of them.
Doyle ain't gonna do a goddamn thing
with Hickey out of town.
The only thing that cockroach might try
is to hire this guy for himself.
Yeah, well, I don't like it.
I don't like changes at the last minute.
And I don't like new faces...
You got a problem with me, Giorgio,
you take it up with your boss.
I just work here.
So I decided
to give up my free room.
I had seen the real thing
and these guys were a long way from it.
I wasn't sure if he was getting
a wooden box ready for me
or if he just wanted to say thanks
for the business.
Well, look who's here.
Last time I saw you,
you was gonna have a talk with some fellas.
Next thing I hear,
one of 'em is dead.
Conversation sort of went downhill.
Ain't that right, Bob?
He don't talk much.
But his ears work good.
You got a room you could rent me?
Surprised you ain't stayin'
with your friends at the Sweetwater.
There's a room upstairs.
To tell you the truth, I can use the money.
You got a name?
Mine's Joe.
Okay, Joe.
You let me know when this runs out.
I'll give you some more.
Yes, sir.
- Got girls for hire in this town?
- Hell, yes.
You're in West Texas.
Round the corner.
Third door on the left.
You can certainly afford 'em.
You remind me of this guy
that used to come see me
when I worked in New Orleans.
He looked a lot like you.
You ever been to New Orleans?
He was nice.
He wasn't as quiet as you, though.
But you two almost look like brothers.
Except he had tattoos.
I think that he was in the Navy, but....
No. And he used to come and see me
every Friday or Saturday night.
His name was Clarence.
I had a lot of fun in New Orleans.
Sorry I ever came to this lousy town.
There's nothing to do here.
I'd take every dance class imaginable
cause I wanted, umh, to be a dancer
and so I came here
because it's off... Aah!
- Let's go!
- Hurry up. Let's get out of here, man.
- Move! Move!
- Go! Go!
Come on!
Get out of the way!
- I didn't do it.
- What?
- I didn't have nothing to do...
- Who set me up?
- Who?!
- They forced me!
They said they'd kill me.
I didn't have no choice.
Give me a name.
Give me a name, goddamn it.
A guy that works for Doyle.
It was Doyle's bunch.
- Please don't tell them I told you.
- Shut up!
Please, I'm sorry.
Her name was Wanda.
Crossing me was nothing personal.
She was just tryin' to make a livin'
in a world where big fish eat little fish.
Come on.
By the time the law showed up,
I was long gone...
but the sheriff didn't let me down.
He investigated the whole thing...
then arrested the hooker.
I went down to the Red Bird,
asked that old geezer who runs the place
where I could find you.
Where we headed?
A juke joint outside of town.
Strozzi wants everybody there.
Is he gonna make another speech?
He don't keep me too well-informed.
Giorgio's always acting
like he's in charge
cause he's the son of somebody
important, Strozzi's boss in Chicago.
Strozzi and Giorgio are really cousins.
Strozzi don't admit it, though.
Not a family man.
Where does that leave you and him?
Slim's was a fast 20 minutes
out across the desert.
Two storeys of wood
in the middle of nowhere.
It was the kind of place that looked like
the special was chicken-fried steak.
Strozzi told me that Giorgio
and the other guys
got a real hot head about
the kind of money you're gettin'.
Giorgio don't like you too much,
in case you haven't noticed.
Why does a guy send his girlfriend
to come find me?
Strozzi figures I wouldn't be dumb enough
to do anything outta line, so he sent me.
Well, that must make you feel real proud.
Quit being a shitheel, all right?
I get enough of that from Strozzi,
thank you.
You sure you're not dumb enough
to do anything outta line?
I'm just curious.
Your boyfriend got a first name?
Yeah.
But only in the bedroom.
As usual,
she was trying to act tough,
but anybody could see
it was paper-thin.
Even with a second-rater like Strozzi,
she was in way over her head.
Well, for Christ's sweet sake,
it took you two long enough.
Kiss my ass.
It's raining outside, Giorgio.
Hard to drive in the rain.
Like he said,
what took you so long?
Maybe you don't hear too good.
It's rainin'.
- Uhn!
- You know somethin'?
You're getting to be more
of a wise-ass Polack every day
and it ain't so cute no more.
You know what happens
to wise-ass Polack dames?
They get their wise asses kicked.
When I was in this whorehouse,
Doyle sent a couple guys to visit me.
- I had to kill 'em both.
- You killed two more o' Doyle's guys?
Is that bullshit or is that true?
Look, I don't give a damn
about Doyle.
If he lost two men tonight,
that's good news.
This Doyle, he's tryin' to outbid me
with my own suppliers. The mick bastard.
Yeah, I try to do business with him,
it's bullshit.
Now, we got a shipment comin' in
from Monterrey next week.
Mr. Doyle has got one coming in
tomorrow.
This is where you're gonna start
to earn your pay.
There's five trucks.
Maybe 200 cases.
We deliver at 200 bucks a case.
That's 200 grand in our books.
Plus, you know
what's really the frostin'?
We get Doyle's trucks.
You know how hard it is
to buy a truck in Mexico?
We crossed the border
a couple hours before dawn.
Strozzi had come with a plan that
he thought would make 'im look good
to the big boss back in Chicago.
It involved hijacking, murder,
corruption of the military
and sticking me right out front.
Who in the hell
are you supposed to be?
This might be a good time
for you guys to give up.
- What is this?
- Told you we couldn't trust Mexicans.
I'm gonna send Smith back with Santo
to keep an eye on Doyle.
You stay with the trucks
till they get to Matamoros.
It was a massacre.
Couldn't say I was real sorry,
but it was a rough way
to check out.
Now, I don't know how reliable
she's ever gonna hold up as a witness.
She's some kind of a vagrant.
Might even be here for immoral purposes.
How much to get her out?
Well, a hundred will send her
on her way right away.
You know, I've been thinking about how
Doyle's men knew I was at that whorehouse.
I figure your deputy here...
heard me last night at the Red Bird,
came over here and told you about it
and you sold the information to Doyle.
How am I doing so far, sheriff?
You are one suspicious fella.
Ain't he, Bob?
Maybe I was a little rough on you
last night.
Maybe I shortchanged you.
If I was you, I'd get outta here.
Doyle's men are gonna think
you tipped me off.
You got a bus
comes through this town?
Yeah, at noon, every day.
Make sure she gets on it.
I got some information
you may wanna sell to Mr. Doyle.
He's gonna find out soon enough,
but you might be the one to give it to 'im.
A shipment of booze he had coming up from
Mexico got hijacked by some bandidos.
Tip like that ought to be worth
at least a grand.
You better be right,
because if Doyle should send Hickey
after me,
he's coming directly for you.
I keep hearing about Hickey.
Sounds like a real scary guy.
Let me tell you just how scary.
It goes that when he was 10 years old...
gets a butcher knife
and cuts his father's throat from ear to ear.
Then they stick 'im in an orphanage.
Fifteen years old, he burns it to the ground.
You just make sure you mark me down
for half of that thousand.
Think maybe you and I should talk.
I don't think these people
appreciate you.
You gonna be my hero?
I thought you were just a guy
who did things for money.
Yeah.
I'm just a guy that does
everything for money.
Anybody see you come up here?
No.
Appreciate me?
You don't know the half of it.
Let me tell you, I don't have to take it
from these bastards.
Going back to Chicago
on the first thing outta here that moves.
What's so funny?
You're not going anywhere.
You're just blowing off
a little steam.
Oh, yeah?
You hear the way Strozzi talked to me?
That grease ball?
To hell with him.
You know, Strozzi's out of town
for the day.
- So is Giorgio.
- So?
Did Strozzi tell you he's payin' me
a lot o' money?
Well, there may be a way for you
to get your hands on some of it.
You gonna tell me why
you would do such a nice thing?
Because I'm a nice guy...
a sweet guy.
Yeah, right.
Like I said...
I don't think they appreciate you.
See, I think you're a very smart girl.
You hear things...
the inside word.
I'm the kind o' guy
that... likes to have
all the information he can get,
so, if you give me the inside word...
I'll give you an extra hundred or so
a week...
just between me and you.
Strozzi and Giorgio
were gonna be back the next day.
But I smelled the real money was gonna come
from working Doyle's side of the street.
They'd make the first move.
Mr. Doyle wants you to come
work for us full-time.
- I'm not sure he can afford it.
- Try me.
- A thousand dollars.
- A week or a day?
I'm surprised
you're not mad at me.
I thought you might hold it against me,
me killing three o' your guys.
It's the only cure I know
for being stupid.
Hey, dummy!
Bring us your best stuff.
Yes, sir, Mr. Doyle.
Right away, sir.
I know you already got a job
working for Strozzi...
but I figure you for the kind o' guy
that goes to the highest bidder...
just like those Mexicans
that were supposed to guard my booze.
Strozzi was behind that,
wasn't 'e?
How would you like to kill Strozzi
and that little punk Giorgio?
From what I hear,
a guy like yourself...
you only care
about the money, right?
I mean it as a compliment.
That's why we're all here.
Where's Hickey?
You heard about Hickey, huh?
I heard he talks kinda funny.
Yeah, well, that's the way you sound
when somebody slices your face,
jams an ice pick in your voice box.
Hickey can get awful messy, though.
This should be an inside job.
We need somebody
nice and neat like you.
- I'll think about it.
- You're making a mistake!
Maybe you're just not very smart.
What the hell are you holding back for?
You think the meek are gonna inherit
the Earth?
If they do,
you won't be there to enjoy it.
I might 'ave been a gun for hire,
but I wasn't exactly an assassin.
Maybe Doyle figured
there wasn't much difference.
Tell Hickey I say hello.
If I was going to get into Doyle's wallet,
I needed something big to sell 'im.
Hey. Whoa!
You don't quit me.
Nobody quits me. What is it, what is it? Doyle?
What did he do? He offer you more money?
Keep the 500 you owe me.
The rest is mine for the work
I did down in Mexico.
- You let 'im walk away? Nobody goes.
- We don't need you. Never.
You get back here,
you yellow son of a bitch.
Hey. Hey.
- Get 'im, now.
- Put those down!
Berto. Smith.
Somethin' you wanna
say to me, Giorgio, huh? Huh?
Fucking kill you, bastard.
It's not your fault
Giorgio's a halfwit.
You really wanna get killed
for a halfwit?
Let it go. Put it down.
Hey.
Tell Mr. Doyle
I turned Strozzi down.
What the hell you grinnin' about?
Goddamn, that was great.
I guess you don't work for Strozzi
no more.
You ever wash these, Joe?
Working for Strozzi
had about played itself out.
Until Hickey showed up,
I was out of moves.
I decided to dry out a little.
Went two days without a drink.
For me,
that's pretty good.
You know, sitting out here in the open
just might not be a real good idea
for a fella that's got
as many enemies as you got.
I thought everybody liked me.
I'm such a nice guy.
This is Mr. Doyle's girl.
I'm bringin' her back from church.
I guess goin' to church makes her feel better
about keepin' company with Mr. Doyle.
That right, honey?
You don't wanna miss out
on the big money.
This little war with Strozzi's
gonna be over soon.
Hickey's back.
We got problems.
Strozzi broke the truce,
hit our trucks in Mexico,
killed all our guys...
jacked the whole load.
Hey. How's my car?
Oh, I fixed that inner tube
and I fixed that headlight.
She's good as new,
except for that windshield.
I ordered new glass,
but it's gonna take a while.
Will this cover it?
Twenty dollars?
That's way too much.
But I got some information
I'll trade you for the change on it.
A fella come around here
asking me about your car,
wanted to look at the registration
and check your name.
- What did you tell 'im?
- I didn't tell 'im nothin'.
He just went on ahead
and looked anyway.
But guess what.
- He didn't find that registration, did he?
- That's right.
You keep that change.
- This fella say what his name was?
- He didn't say, but I know who it was.
One of them Italian boys been hangin'
around town named George... Giorgio.
Thanks.
All right, so come on.
Jesus Christ!
Somebody answer
the goddamn phone!
Maybe Chicago found a way
to get through. Yeah?
Ah. Looks like I struck pay dirt.
Who's this? Giorgio?
Yeah. Who's this?
You remember me.
The high-paid nobody.
I got a message for Strozzi.
Yeah, well, we don't need any messages
from jerks like you, all right?
Don't be stupid. Just because I don't work
for you doesn't mean I can't be a friend.
I don't wanna see
your boss get hurt.
Yeah. Well, you tell 'im that Doyle knows that
he's the one that hijacked his shipment
but maybe you got a bigger problem.
There's a rumor Ramirez is gonna go back
on Doyle's payroll.
Who knows? Maybe it's all just bullshit.
You gettin' this, Giorgio?
Yeah, I'm gettin' it.
All bullshit.
Yeah, good boy.
You tell your cousin
to watch his ass.
The Italians were winning
in New York and Chicago...
but they weren't doing
too good in Jericho.
I don't care who said what, just
take care of those cases before I get back.
A little past 9 that night,
I got a look at Giorgio leaving town.
You could almost see the price tag
hangin' around his neck.
I just came by to tell you that me
and Strozzi made it up this morning.
I got an investment there,
so... we can forget about the other day
like it never happened, right?
I mean,
it was just one time for fun, right?
Business is business.
I don't wanna get myself
in the middle of anything here.
Strozzi's gonna take care o' me.
I saw that punk Giorgio
sneak outta town.
Where's he headed?
He went to El Mirado.
- What's he doin' down in Mexico?
- What he always does.
Drinks, messes around,
goes to whorehouses.
I'm surprised Strozzi didn't go.
- He must be gettin' pretty used to whores by now.
- Goddamn you.
What?
I think you're forgettin'
about our deal.
Now, why did Giorgio go to Mexico?
He went to finish doin'
some business with Ramirez.
Pay him off,
and the cop they got for security.
I gotta go.
We're quits now, right?
We're quits.
That mouthy little cousin
of Strozzi's, Giorgio,
he's on his way down to Mexico
right now, see a friend of yours.
Fella named Ramirez.
You know a guy
named Ramirez, do you?
Gonna pay 'im back
for the hijack.
- How do you like the story so far?
- Good. Keep talkin'.
He's gonna see a cop
down there too.
This cop's responsibility was security
on this side of the border.
So I guess he's gonna get paid too.
They're probably all planning
their next shipment. Gonna use your trucks.
You know...
I don't want to be pushy, but...
this kind o' information's
a little too valuable to be given away.
Giorgio's very important to Strozzi.
If somethin' were to happen to him,
it would be very bad for Strozzi,
don't you think?
Take as much as you want.
You work for me now.
I'll just take
the 2000 we agreed upon.
You work with us,
you work with the winners.
- Anything else is stupid.
- I'll think about it.
What the hell you holding back for?
I don't play this style!
What the hell
you holding back for?
His name's Smith.
At least that's what he says.
This is Hickey.
I told you about 'im.
He told me all about you.
Been hearing about you
all over town, actually.
I especially like
that orphanage story.
He tell you about all them little kids
burnin' up like candles?
My favorite part.
You shot some of our guys.
I guess I did.
The ones that deserved it.
Well, you got Finn.
He's Doyle's best shooter.
I thought you were the best.
No, just the best-lookin'.
Enough of this bullshit!
This game is finished.
Come on. We gotta talk.
I guess you better go talk.
Yeah.
Don't believe
everything you hear.
El Mirado was about 30 miles
across the Rio Grande.
The whole town
was celebrating some saint's day,
which meant everybody
was either drunk
or workin' on it.
Doyle took my bait and sent a car
due south the next morning.
You didn't have to be real smart
to guess who the passenger was.
No, thanks.
Looks to me you're a cop.
You wearin' a gun, Red?
Yes, sir.
That's good.
Maybe you're the kinda guy
that'd shoot an unarmed man in the back.
Make your play.
We're takin' you outta here, Giorgio.
Just don't shoot me.
- Come on.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
She looks like her mother.
It's all right. He's asleep.
I parked a couple miles from here
and walked in.
Why do you come out here?
Doyle lets me be alone here.
It's the only place
they don't watch me.
Why do you stay with him?
People don't own other people.
A year ago, my husband...
gambled with Mr. Doyle.
After he lost me,
he went back across the border.
He was ashamed.
When Doyle took me
from my daughter...
I went to sleep.
All I had left was to pray.
My fear is my curse.
What's yours?
I was born
without a conscience.
There's a fella here...
come to see you.
John Smith, uh...
meet captain Tom Pickett.
He is the head ranger
here in my district.
He generally just comes down when, uh....
Shut up, Galt.
Sit down, Mr. Smith.
Now, sheriff, Mr. Smith and I
are gonna have a drink.
We got a lot to talk about tonight.
I'm here about
a murdered policeman.
Got himself killed other side of the river
in some crumby little Mexican town.
Few locals killed too...
and a double-dealing comandante
named Ramirez.
But the man I'm concerned about
was an American on the border patrol.
He had a family.
Well-liked by his brother officers.
I guess he strayed a little bit
in some departments,
but he was an officer of the law
just the same.
You know anything
about his death, son?
- No, I don't think so.
- That's odd.
Don't hardly seem possible.
Mr. Galt here says you're real well-informed
on what happens around here.
You sayin' I did it?
I asked if you knew anything about it,
not if you did it.
The crime has been solved, son. Mexican
police picked up two armed drifters
from the state of Florida just across
the border. Handed them over to us.
They ain't confessed yet,
but they will.
I just can't get past the idea
that maybe one of these two bootleg
gangs had something to do with it.
I learned a long time ago
to trust my instincts.
Now listen real careful,
because here is the point, son.
Things in this town
are out of control.
Two gangs is just one too many.
I'm not an idealist.
I know a lot of things that people do
are awful low,
but that's between them and God.
Do you believe in God?
I believe in God, son.
But what I'm concerned with
is keepin' a lid on things.
And what we got here in Jericho
is just way out of hand.
And sheriff Galt here,
he can't do much about it, right?
Matter of fact, it might be fair to say
he's part of the problem, right?
Now, you been going back and forth
playing both sides according to Mr. Galt here.
Making yourself a lot o' money
out of all this.
Well, it's over, son.
I'm comin' back here in 10 days.
I'm gonna bring
about 20 rangers with me.
I will tolerate one gang
because that is the nature of things.
A certain amount of corruption
is inevitable.
But if I find two gangs here
when I get back,
then in a couple of hours,
there will be no gangs here.
So it's simple.
One gang quits and goes home.
You boys work it out.
I don't give a damn which one.
Just so long as one side leaves,
or... maybe one side loses.
That's fine too, son.
Kill as many as you want.
Just don't kill no innocent people
around here.
I wouldn't like that.
Been real nice talking to you,
captain.
Likewise, son.
Only one more thing.
When I come back,
if I was you...
I'd be gone.
You tell Strozzi
we got his boy Giorgio.
Tell 'im he wants 'im back to bring 100
thou to the crossing at the five-mile road.
- Tell 'im to make it 3 in the afternoon.
- The trucks.
Oh, yeah. And we'll give youse two days
to give us our trucks back.
All the vultures showed up
for the exchange.
If I was honest, I guess I'd have
to include myself in the roll call.
But if there was a hundred grand
being handed over for Giorgio...
I wanted to take
a real good look at it.
Stick around.
You get the briefcase,
you let go of the rope.
Don't shoot. They got Giorgio.
We're even now. You got one choice.
- Give up your whole operation.
- Santo.
Son of a bitch.
Until I get Giorgio back,
she stays with me.
And I guess you know what I'm gonna
be doin' with her, right, Doyle?
Bring him across!
Don't try anything stupid, Doyle.
Nice and easy, huh?
You don't wanna
get the girl killed, right?
Go. Get her back, now.
You all right? Did they touch you?
They do anything?
Strozzi! I'm gonna
settle things with you, Strozzi.
I promise, you wop bastard.
I promise. I promise!
I had a visitor about 3
in the afternoon the next day.
She'd had enough of Jericho...
but was too broke
to buy a bus ticket out.
I slipped her 500 bucks.
Usually, I wasn't such a sucker...
but somebody had smacked her around
pretty good.
He's been in a real bad mood...
ever since his cousin
got traded back for that girl.
Been fightin' with Giorgio,
acting like a real jerk...
yellin' at anything
that gets near 'im.
I never seen 'im drunk before...
but he was really
in the bag last night.
What'd you do?
I called him a name.
So he slapped me,
slugged me a couple o' times.
Threw my clothes out
on the street.
So I figured I'd get even.
I told him
about me and you.
Well, I guess
things could be worse.
When you get back
to wherever it is you're goin'...
maybe you should try and
find yourself a better class o' guy.
No guy's gonna ever wanna
mess with me again.
Your face will heal up.
Your looks are all right.
How is this gonna heal up?
Like he said,
I got a big mouth.
He had three guys
hold me down.
Told Giorgio to slice it off.
They were real drunk.
But everything you ever did to me,
you did on purpose, right?
Right?
Did you finish all your business
inside with the little princess?
Just make sure
she gets on that bus.
You know somethin', amigo?
I think I just spotted a chink
in your armor.
When you go down,
it's gonna be over a skirt.
For most o' my life,
I made my own rules.
You don't do any favors.
You don't ask for any.
Watch the percentages.
But you can know the rules
and still do the wrong things.
The only thing
I knew for sure was this:
Strozzi, Doyle, and every son of a bitch
that worked for 'em...
They were all gonna be
better off dead.
There's, uh, somebody out here
to see you, Mr. Doyle.
I thought it over.
I'll take the job.
You must smell a winner.
Get a thousand in advance.
Nobody's worth that much.
He's good.
Better than that?
Put that goddamn gun away!
Put it away!
- Save it for Strozzi!
- Suit yourself.
Buy 'im.
A thousand.
And a thousand more
when we win.
It's settled.
Let's have a drink on it.
What about the girl?
- What girl?
- The one you keep.
Strozzi gets a hold of her again,
he'll blackmail you right out of town.
Don't worry about it.
We got her in a safe place.
And eight guys out there
on watch.
Eight's not gonna be enough.
Strozzi's got some new trigger men
comin' in town tonight.
Where'd you hear all this?
Maybe it's just a rumor.
You want me to check it out?
I want you and Hickey
here with me.
If Strozzi's got new help comin' in,
chances are he's gonna try to rush us here.
You go out to the country,
check on 'er.
She means a lot to me.
McCool can tell you
how to get there.
The girl upstairs?
You don't have to.
- Don't come any closer. I'll kill her.
- Just put the gun down.
Keep away from her
or I swear to God, I'll kill her.
No!
Get dressed.
We gotta get outta here.
Gotta get you to Mexico.
Come on. Move.
Here, take this money.
Take it. I got it from Doyle.
I want you to use it.
Get across the border
and don't come back.
Come on. Get goin'.
Go.
Go.
I always liked sinners
a lot better than saints.
She was real easy to look at...
but I hoped
I never saw 'er again.
They're all dead inside.
Found them last night.
- Where's the girl?
- I don't know.
Strozzi must have taken 'er.
All of 'em.
This is a slaughter.
You were right
about those extra trigger men.
Must've taken 15 or 20
of Strozzi's guys to pull this off.
This whole thing
is turning on us.
When you found 'em out here,
why didn't you drive back and tell us...
instead o' just waitin' out here?
Figured the girl ran off
when the fightin' started.
I stuck around
hopin' maybe she'd come back.
She didn't.
This one hasn't been fired.
Must have got killed
before he got a shot off.
Strozzi is jealous of me
givin' her a chance.
She grew up in
some filthy little village.
Told me her mother
was a Yaqui Indian.
Didn't know much about her father...
except he was white.
She married some lowlife wetback.
The only thing he ever gave 'er...
a kid.
Jesus Christ,
she only had one dress till she met me.
The way she looked...
the way her eyes looked...
I couldn't help taking 'er
out of all that.
We gotta hit Strozzi soon...
get 'er back.
We have to get this thing over with.
I'm gonna head back into town
and see what I can find out.
Maybe Strozzi doesn't know
I work for you guys yet.
We have to get this thing over with.
Hickey was suspicious,
Doyle was nuts
and McCool was stupid.
Except maybe I was
the dumb one.
If I had any brains, I would've
kept on drivin' straight south into Mexico.
Keep 'er gassed up
and ready to go.
Yes, sir, I'll do 'er, but pretty soon
you're gonna be on your own.
Come next week
I'm gettin' the hell out.
Ain't no business here.
This town... is finished.
As usual, it was hot as hell...
and the wind picked up the dust
so much you could taste it.
The whiskey helped...
but I didn't wanna get sloppy
so I switched to beer.
Somehow I had the feelin'
the walls were movin' in on me.
It's funny
how it all works out.
For one little second, you think
you're gonna get away free and clear...
but you end up
payin' the price.
No exceptions.
Everybody pays the price,
even a bum like me.
Take the guns.
What is it?
Strozzi doesn't have
Doyle's half-breed.
McCool went across the border
lookin' for her...
down in El Mirado.
And run into a guy
with an interesting story.
He'd seen 'er headin' out.
She sold our car to some guy
for a couple of hundred bucks.
Took a bus south.
So, Strozzi didn't take her.
Maybe,
if you believe the guy's story.
Why would a guy lie?
Which leaves the question
of how she got away.
Big question.
Not that we give a damn.
Indian girl, you know.
It's not like she was
the Blessed Virgin, is it?
Out there in the country...
only a real fine gunner
could have nailed that many...
all by himself.
But you work for us.
Why would you do that?
Maybe you don't work for us.
Maybe you take the money,
do what you want.
You one of them?
You an independent?
Who you running from?
Jericho's a good place to stop
on your way to Mexico,
runnin' from the feds.
For chrissakes,
everybody's runnin' from somethin'.
No. See, working for people
like me and Doyle work for
has an advantage.
The payroll covers
a lot of ground.
- You scared...
- Water's gettin' cold.
Where is she?
He's nothin' without a gun.
After a while, you stop hearing
your bones break, your teeth rattle.
You just concentrate on holdin' tight
to that little part right at the center.
The rest doesn't matter.
They're gonna
take the rest anyway.
Must've crawled off.
Block the streets.
Wall him up! Wall him up!
Find 'im for me.
Search this whole hick town.
Look over there. Over there!
There, there! Over there!
Tear up every goddamn inch
of this place!
- Go on.
- Find 'im.
You guys, come with me.
Get those cars.
Wall up these streets.
Find 'im! Find 'im!
Hey, come with me.
- All right.
- Come on around the back.
Now. Clear.
Come on. Over here. Let's go.
Come on.
Find 'im.
Find 'im!
Here! He's gotta be here.
Nobody in, nobody out!
Search this place.
Upstairs, behind the bar.
Now! Find 'im!
You, where is he? I know he's here.
- Who?
- Smith!
- Oh!
- Don't hold out on me, you shitheel!
- I'll stick a knife in your throat!
- Oh.
Check the closets.
- Nothing in here.
- Not here.
I'm tellin' you,
don't you mess with me.
This is not a game!
Don't play around!
You don't wanna talk to me?
You won't talk to anybody anymore.
You think I'm kiddin'?
Where is 'e?
Little fella...
doesn't wanna talk to us?
He came here, didn't he?
- Oh.
- Hold it. Goddamn it. Hold it.
You hold it, John Law.
It's gone way past you.
- This thing with Strozzi is over.
- Strozzi? You know where he is right now?
He's holed up with the rest of his gang
waitin' for some new shooters
that are comin' from back east
to help 'im out.
Where's Smith?
He's at Slim's Roadhouse.
We checked all over.
He ain't upstairs.
Come on. Load it up.
We're going to the roadhouse.
You better be right.
- What took you so long?
- I had to make it look good.
You know, my helping you out
don't make a hell of a lot of sense.
But I'm bettin' on the ranger.
I know that the big-money days
are just about done,
but don't kid yourselves, boys.
It could still come down real hard.
Mr. Smith...
I will help hide you.
But I prefer you'd be unarmed
and on your way the hell outta this town.
That move you made
for Doyle's little honey...
in this league...
that'll get you broke and dead.
Both at the same time.
By the time we got
to Slim's Roadhouse,
Strozzi's men were trapped
inside the burning building.
The ones that made
a run for it got shot.
The ones that stayed inside
got cooked.
None of 'em were gonna
make it home to Chicago.
Don't shoot! Don't shoot me!
I know where the money is.
Don't shoot me!
How about it, Strozzi?
What's it gonna be?
I give up. You can have it.
You can have everything.
Take it all.
No!
No!
No!
Kill 'im.
Let's go.
After the fire dies down,
go inside.
Pull out Smith's body
if you can find it.
He's gotta be dead.
He didn't come out.
Everybody in there
has gotta be dead.
A little after dawn, Joe and Galt
got me to the abandoned church.
The bill for helping the Indian girl
included kicked-in ribs,
a broken nose,
one eye mashed up pretty good.
But all I needed was a gun...
and some time to heal.
Hey, Joe.
Oh!
That's enough.
Get 'im inside.
Give 'im a little more.
- He needs another drink.
- No.
No!
No!
We know he ain't dead yet.
We counted the bodies out there.
Maybe you should take your shoes off
and look at your toes.
Hickey gets back,
we'll be cuttin' 'em off one by one.
I knew by the sound of the car
it wasn't Joe.
It's a funny thing about people.
One time out of a hundred,
they turned out better than you expect.
Just your old amigo.
Joe got caught...
making his daily run.
The food, the bandages,
they just gave 'im away.
Hickey?
No, McCool and a couple other guys.
Hickey and Doyle are in Mexico.
Doyle's still lookin'
for that half-breed Indian girl.
I mean, is that a persistent
little bastard or what?
Where did they take Joe?
They're all over at Strozzi's hotel.
Doyle moved 'em all over there
after winnin' the war.
You really think that
you're gonna fight anybody with that?
I can get a gun with it.
That's the only help you gonna get.
I always hated it
when I owe somebody.
But sometimes
you just gotta play out a bad hand.
There were gonna be a lot more
wooden boxes in Smiley's window.
But what the hell.
Everybody ends up dead.
It's just a matter of when.
Well, thank you.
God!
Damn!
Go back to the Red Bird.
Get my valise.
Bring another bottle of whiskey.
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.
What's that?
It's a message... for Hickey.
Him and Doyle get back,
you tell 'em I'm out at Slim's Roadhouse.
Slim's Roadhouse?
It's burned to the ground.
It's gone, the whole place.
You all right?
- When is that ranger due back?
- Day after tomorrow.
That will give you enough time
to get it cleaned up.
Cleaned up? I'm just gonna
haul those bodies out the hotel,
take 'em out in the desert and
let the coyotes chew on 'em for a while.
Then I'm headed for Houston.
Even Frank the undertaker
is leavin' town, for chrissake.
What kind of town we gonna have
without an undertaker?
How 'bout you, Joe?
You're stayin' put, ain't you?
No, sir.
Right now, I'm goin' with him.
Like hell you are.
I just wanna
see this thing finished.
I earned it.
Joe and I sat up all night
waitin' for Hickey and Doyle.
When this thing got started,
all I wanted to do was make some money.
Somewhere along the way,
it all got personal.
You know...
for a guy with no principles,
sometimes you act kinda peculiar.
Don't go gettin' mushy on me, Joe.
I was just tryin' to say thank you.
When I hear people thankin' me,
I generally start runnin'.
How's your wound doin'?
Hurts like hell.
Closest doctor to here anymore
is just across the river in Mexico.
I can show you the way.
Go on back there and hide.
Go find a spot. Go on.
Stay hidden.
You had me fooled.
I really thought you burned up
with the rest of 'em.
Nah. I knew better.
It was always gonna come down
to somethin' like this.
I want you thinkin' about me
when you're dyin'.
Looks to me like
you're the one bleedin'.
Now, hold it.
We can get you a doctor.
Get you patched up.
You're gonna run this town
with us. I need you.
Give me a fair fight,
you won't need a doctor.
No, wait!
We don't need the guns.
You and me and Hickey,
we won this war. We're survivors.
We won! We won!
I haven't found the girl yet.
You know, the girl.
You must know where she is.
You think we can still find 'er?
We can go to Mexico.
She had a kid.
A little girl.
I gotta get her back.
I'm tellin' you
we can be partners.
That's for what he done
to my town.
You're gonna have to kill me too.
No. Don't worry.
I'm all done.
I'm just gonna watch.
I don't wanna die in Texas.
Chicago, maybe.
You can meet me there if you want,
and... try and kill me.
Maybe you're the kind o' guy...
that would shoot an unarmed man
in the back.
Done worse than that.
I can't say it all went exactly
the way I planned.
But I was right about one thing.
They were all better off dead.
Goddamn, I wasn't real sure
this old gun would still shoot.
Looks like you got yourself
a new car.
And that was it.
It ended about the same place
where it started.
Out in the desert
on the road to Mexico.
And I was just as broke
as when I arrived.
But something would turn up.
