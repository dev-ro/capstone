This is how it started.
Four best friends and a book.
Vivian was the one who had the idea.
She'd seen it in a magazine,
and it was that very first book
that gave her a lifelong philosophy.
You know what
I find sexiest about you?
Do tell.
You don't need me.
I don't need anyone.
It's the secret to my success.
And successful she was.
The hotel we were standing
in front of...
...she owns.
And ten years later,
she tore it down
and built a new one.
Good morning, Miss O'Donnell.
Yeah, I'll call you back.
Slim?
This is Arthur.
The first time they had sex
was on a mix board.
They were madly in love.
He proposed.
She said no.
He left town.
My, 0h, my.
Arthur Riley.
What's it been, 40 years?
That's impossible.
That would mean I was only six.
- Still a wiseass?
- Yeah.
Old habits die hard.
I got to get back
to this meeting, but,
are you going to be
in town for a while?
I would hope so. I do live here.
I'll find you.
It's good to see you, Slim.
Now, Sharon
was Vivian's roommate
as an undergrad at Stanford.
- Then she went to law school.
Of the 301 people
in her graduating class,
62 were women.
Of the 62,
one became a federal judge.
He's on the phone now?
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to take
a five-minute recess.
All rise.
This court will stand
in recess for five minutes.
No, no, no.
You're never interrupting.
How is Hawaii?
You got en-- engaged?
Why? I mean, wow!
I didn't mean "why,"
I meant "wow." Wow.
Well, if I sound judgmental, that...
That's a professional hazard.
Who's Cheryl?
I didn't know
your father was seeing someone.
Good for him.
And you. Good for both...
Congratulations all around. Yeah.
In 1985, Sharon married Tom
because he made her laugh.
By 1999, she was no longer laughing.
And the final straw came
when Tom asked her
what “Don Quix-ote" was about.
The marriage ended
and Sharon bought a cat.
Carol put herself
through culinary school,
working as a waitress at a diner.
She had two goals in life:
one, to own and operate
her own restaurant,
and two, to marry the man
of her dreams, Bruce Colby.
Since the moment they met,
they've not been able to
keep their hands off each other.
Ooh!
- Happy anniversary.
Happy anniversary.
Dance lessons!
Yep.
- Wow.
- Yes.
Because the No Kid Hungry fundraiser
is a talent show this year
and I signed us up.
- To be in the talent show?
- Yes!
I thought it was something fun
we could do together
now that you're retired.
Now this is gorgeous!
Eargasms!
Yeah, I got us both a pair.
Multiple Eargasms.
Who does not love that?
Well, no, it's so you can watch TV
in bed without disturbing me,
and my snoring
won't keep you awake.
That's very thoughtful.
What do you say we get home and...
- I say yes.
- Yay.
And then, there's me.
I didn't know what my path
was going to be,
and then it hit me,
with a wave of nausea.
Because of this guy,
Harry Whittaker.
We got married, and I became a...
- Mom!
- What?
Stop already.
What? No!
I just need to clear the caulk.
- Clear the caulk?
- Yes.
There's a cute little ladybug
trying to get out the window.
Okay, someone's been watching
way too much HGTV.
Mom, put the screwdriver down.
What?
Mom.
- We've been talking.
- Yes?
We want to move you to Arizona.
Move me? My God.
What am I, cattle?
These are our two daughters.
Harry is an accountant.
Well, he was an accountant.
Your house is falling apart,
and you don't have Dad to fix it.
I know, but, my friends,
they live here.
And your family lives there.
We just want you close t0 us, Mom.
No, but...
- Feel it out for the weekend.
- If not for you, for us, please.
- It's what Dad would've wanted.
- All right.
Well,
it's been over 40 years
and through it all, every month,
we still get together for...
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Arthur as in Arthur?
Wait a minute.
Are you talking about...
-radio-station-sex Arthur?
- Yes!
Proposed-with-a-milkshake Arthur.
That Arthur.
And he's staying at the hotel.
Does he not hate you, though?
He's got to.
No. Thai was M) years aged.!
Yeah, but still.
There she is.
My son is engaged
and my husband is in Maui
with a tartlet named Cheryl.
I need a drink.
Your "husband"?
You can't possibly still care
about what Tom is doing.
I don't care.
But the guy gets seasick
in a swimming pool.
I mean, what the hell
is he doing in Maui?
Sounds like he's
doing Cheryl in Maui.
Please.
Who gets involved
in a relationship at 67?
I mean, what is the point?
The point is to get laid.
It's always the point.
- Don't make me sick.
- Who still says "get laid“?
Who still has any interest?
No, no, no. I am not gonna
let us become those people.
- What people...
- You know what people.
The people who stop living
before they stop living.
I haven't had sex since my divorce
and it's been the happiest
18 years of my life.
That must be
some kind of record.
I mean, what even happens
to a vagina after 18 years?
I think Werner Herzog
did a documentary on that.
Yeah. It's called
The Cave of Forgotten Dreams.
Okay! Will you stop it?
Moving on.
Let's talk about the book.
God. The hiking book? Really?
Come on! I liked it!
It's such a remarkable undertaking.
Can you imagine?
No, I cannot. I don't even
like walking to my mailbox.
It's just an amazing story.
So many layers. I wouldn't
even know how to break it down.
I'll break it down for you.
She hikes, she lost her boot,
she did heroin.
Did you only read the back cover?
I wish.
I kept wanting to shout at her,
"Wait ten years, honey.
Dry shampoo is coming."
If you would ever
connect with something
on a more emotional level...
Emotional connection
is highly overrated.
You have not had an emotional
connection for 4O years.
Wow, that must be
some type of record.
Yeah, but what happens
to emotions after 4O years?
Okay, okay,
are you guys having fun?
Come on.
You know we love you.
Maybe it's time
you did take a hike
and try to reconnect
with your own true self.
I'll buy you a backpack.
I'll tell you how to reconnect
with your own true self,
and it ain't by walking alone
through the desert.
I would like to introduce you
to Christian Grey.
No.
It was a bestseller
made into a movie.
- That is our theme this year.
- Wow.
We are not reading this.
It's my month!
When it's your month,
you can choose whatever
boring, depressing book you want.
I'm not sure
this qualifies as a book.
Well, 50 million people
can't be wrong.
To-- To even be holding
this book is embarrassing.
Who's judging you, your cat?
I do like the idea of a romance.
We are too old!
But it says right here
"for mature audiences.“
Yeah, that certainly sounds like us.
We started this book club
to stimulate our minds.
Well, from what I hear,
this book is quite stimulating.
God.
So... come on!
- Let's toast to our new book.
- All right.
- Good.
- Drink up. Hoist that glass.
- Yeah.
- Happy reading, ladies!
God.
Okay.
My...
I didn't...
I'm really so terribly...
I'm so sorry.
'Can 'can
- You need some help?
- I'm sorry. No, I'm fine.
I really didn't mean to disturb you.
- Too late.
- I know, I know.
Wow.
It's... This is so humiliating.
- Are you okay?
- I'm ...
- I'm really scared of flying.
- You shouldn't be.
Yeah, well,
I won't be once these...
kick into my bloodstream.
The safest way to travel.
- Want to know why you think that?
- Why?
Because you never met anybody
who's been in a plane crash.
- And you want to know why?
- Why?
Because they're all dead.
I think those pills
are affecting you already.
I think so.
My God.
What-- What takes you to Arizona?
My...
My daughters live there.
Well, that should be fun.
Not exactly.
They're kind of forcing me to go.
Why?
Well...
my husband, he died last year, so...
Plane crash?
You didn't say that.
- Sorry, that was a bad joke.
- That's okay.
- I'm really sorry for your loss.
- I'm sorry, too. No, well...
Thank you, that's sweet.
Thank you so much.
Yeah...
Hey!
I'm sorry. My God.
This is terrible.
- Wow.
- I'm so...
That was the jet bridge
and we're still on the ground.
- We're still on the ground?
- Yeah.
I'm so terribly sorry.
- I'm quite all right.
- Okay.
Anything I can do to make
your flight more comfortable.
I appreciate that,
thank you so much.
Jesus.
Wow.
on...
Okay.
Give me a break, okay?
This...
Whoa!
My God, yes.
You know, I was wondering.
That must have been one heck
of a book you were reading.
May I ask what it was?
- Moby Dick. That's what it was.
- Moby Dick.
Melville.
I didn't realize Christian Grey
had a nickname.
- Enjoy Arizona.
- Yeah, sure, of course.
Not a problem.
Miss O'Donnell,
I have an Arthur Riley for you.
Is that so'?
Take a message.
Take a message?
Really?
I didn't realize that...
that you were here.
We just saw each other
in the lobby two days ago.
Pity. They say the memory
is the second thing to go.
- What's the first thing to go?
- Can't remember.
I'm impressed.
- How did you find me?
- Google.
- Google?
- Yeah. It's a service on the computer.
Yeah, I know Google.
Well, I'm younger than you,
so I didn't know...
Cute. Cute.
What do you say?
May a gentleman buy you
a cup of coffee?
Well, a gentleman certainly may.
Do you know of one?
It was the mid-'80s.
I became obsessed
with risk management.
You obsessed with work?
That's crazy.
I know, right? Shocking!
I could see the system
was set up for trouble.
Of course, none of the men
in my firm believed me.
Well, men can be
a little slow on the uptake.
Bad for them, good for me.
And, um...
you never picked up
a husband along the way?
No!
Like I said, I'm way too good...
at forecasting risk.
I figure by now, I've saved myself
-a lot of money in legal fees.
- True dat.
How about you?
ls there a Mrs. Riley?
Yes.
The good Mrs. Riley
is back on the East Coast,
having absconded with
my last name, my dog,
and my co-op on the park.
What did you do wrong?
Well, let's just say
I was a little less good
at assessing risk.
Whoa! Torn, talk about
false advertising.
Whoa!
Jesus.
Join Tom
and Cheryl and millions of others
who found love on Bumble.
Join Tom and Cheryl as they
copulate in a coconut tree.
- Judge Meyers?
- Yes.
Hi. It's 12:15.
Well, I really have
to stay with this, so, urn...
If you could just tell them that we have
to move it to next week, please.
Of course. Yeah.
Rev up your love life
with these tips from Bumble--
Make love happen now
and change your life--
Do you need anything else,
Your Honor?
A man
of your dreams is just a click away.
No, I don't. I'm fine.
- Thank you.
- Yep.
Here you go.
Make a wish.
What are you doing?
I made a wish.
What did you wish for?
I always wish for the same thing:
a healthy planet.
That's not your wish.
That's not even a wish!
Wishes have to be personal,
not global.
- Since when?
- Since forever.
And secondly, you can't
tell anybody your wish.
Otherwise it negates the whole thing.
No, God, you're not gonna
go in there. Don't do that.
Well, somebody has to.
You made an improper wish
and you've jeopardized
the entire planet.
God, you are insane.
You are insane! Don't go in!
I have no choice here.
You're obviously the type of person
who's too delicate
to go in after her own penny.
You think I'm delicate?
See? Delicate.
You know, what you're reading
as delicate is this.
It's this bracelet
that costs as much as a car!
Let's see that bracelet.
- No. Not my phone--
- Dear!
- Dear.
- No, no. Boy.
- Now you have done it.
- What do you mean?
God, it's scary how addicted
you kids are to your phone.
No, give it to me!
Hold on one second here!
I've never seen...
You know, I think you might need
to talk to someone about this.
I see why you lost
your co-op on the park.
- I hope that's waterproof.
- No.
- No bathing in the fountain.
- Okay!
But technically, we're not bathing.
- Arthur.
- And she started it.
He doesn't care who started it!
It was him.
- Out.
- All right.
Wait a minute.
- I found it.
- That's so great.
Did you see that?
Would you mind just taking a photo?
I hate my life.
It might take a little bit of time,
but you're gonna love it
here in Arizona.
- I don't--
- Let's face it...
You being here
makes more sense for all of us.
We can't jump on a plane
every time something happens to you.
What are you talking about,
"happens to me"?
You could slip and fall
at any moment.
I don't want to overstate the dangers
for a woman your age living alone,
but I did research online,
and it's pretty alarming.
But you do know, I mean,
I'm really not that old.
Well, no, you're not, Mom,
but neither was Dad.
I know, honey, I know.
I need a coffee.
Well, the good coffee
is all the way upstairs.
Mom, why don't you wait down here?
Wait down here? Sure.
God forbid, I can't go up
an escalator at my age.
But hurry back. I could slip and fall
at any moment.
- Just sit there, Mommy.
- Ooh!
- I'll get you a chamomile?
- God. Yeah, thanks.
Be careful!
They brought
the kids to see you?
- Yeah.
- That's good.
God, what?
- Hello.
- Have you ever been spanked?
- What?
- As an adult, sexually.
I mean, is this
what people are doing?
Carol, it's Diane.
You dialed the wrong number.
No. Have you not read the book?
Yes. I've read it.
Of course I have.
- And?
- I don't know who her lawyer is,
but she should not have
signed that contract.
Look, clearly,
we have things to discuss.
I'm gonna call
an emergency book club.
That means you got to
get back here, pronto.
I'd come back
for an emergency colonoscopy,
but it's just a little bit
more complicated here.
God. How is life in Scottsdale?
Well, I don't know, I feel like I'm...
...in an episode of The Walking Dead.
Wait a second. You sound
out of breath. Where are you?
I'm going to a...
a dance rehearsal and I'm late.
- You're late? You're never late.
- I know!
This book has got me
in a total tizzy. Just get back here.
I'll get back there. Bye.
- Wow.
- Chin up.
And one, two, three.
Go, two, three.
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three. Wait.
"- Stop!
- ,
Stop, stop, stop!
Honey, I think we're supposed
to go this way.
To the left.
Right. Which is what I did.
His left. This way.
Back, two, three.
Side, two, three.
Okay, I got it. I was wrong.
I was wrong, you were right.
My little Fred Astaire.
I will follow you
wherever you want to go.
- How about lunch?
- We start again.
You know what? I'm wondering...
Do you think it would be
possible for us
to just skip straight
to our choreography?
We must first learn... to dance!
Right. I know.
But I sort of do know
how to dance. Come on, I do.
I still remember
the whole tap dance
to "Red, Red Robin Goes
Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along“
that I did when I was six.
It's like savant-ish.
Sounds like you peaked early.
What?
- What did she say?
- You're asking me?
So, what is going on
with little Ginsburg here?
Well, she's not herself lately.
She... She has no energy.
She's really lost the spark of life.
She's just kind of blah.
It sounds like we have
a lethargic pussy on our hands.
Seriously?
Have there been
any changes at home?
Any new people or pets
moving in or out?
At home? God, no.
There hasn't been
a change at home forever.
And what about diet?
I've tried a few, but I like to eat.
So whatever weight I take off,
I put right back on, so...
it's useless.
You're talking about the cat.
I am a veterinarian.
I knew that.
Would the passenger in seat 17-D
please report to the cockpit?
I repeat, the passenger in seat 17-D,
please report to the cockpit.
Thank you.
Hi.
I just need a little bit
more information from you.
Urn, we need phone numbers,
home and cell.
And cell...
Also, a current home address.
What, really?
Okay.
Also, an email and whatever
nights you are typically free.
You...
You've got to be kidding me.
Pilots, we never kid
about things like this.
No!
Wait, I don't understand.
- What are you doing here?
- Flying the plane, I think.
So, you're a pilot?
I think so. They gave me the hat.
My God.
Thank you.
This is how you ask someone
for their number?
Not usually,
but you are very special.
Can I take you to dinner?
My God.
What's going on here?
I think what I'm doing
is asking you to dinner.
- But what is the beeping?
- It's an alarm.
Yeah, but what does that
actually mean?
Usually, an alarm means
there's something wrong.
- Go fix it!
- I can't, I'm in the middle of something.
Let's just cut this short
Do something. Just do something.
I can't, until we figure
this dinner thing out.
Okay, fine! Yeah, what the hell.
Just get the hell back in there!
Okay, here's the alarm.
I will call you.
My God.
This book! I mean, the things
Christian does to her!
My God! It's absurd.
I could have put him in jail
for any one of those things.
But she sure was having fun.
Yes, she was.
It's not like we don't have fun.
No, but it's a different kind of fun.
- Very different.
- Like this.
- This is fun.
- For sure.
I just can't stop thinking about
when he snuck her off
and he gave it to her right there
in the boathouse, you know?
- The boathouse.
- Yeah.
Do you think anyone
our age still goes...
Hi, beautiful friends!
Yeah, I think some people do.
Let me guess.
You saw Arthur again.
I did, I did. We had coffee.
And you slept with him.
God, no!
Although I have to admit,
he's still very charming and fun.
So you find him charming and fun,
but you didn't sleep with him.
Exactly.
I don't sleep with people I like.
You know that.
- I gave that up in the '90s.
- You make no sense.
I make perfect sense.
Now, now, now, now.
Tell me what is going on.
Tell me everything.
You are too happy. I don't like this.
Okay.
- Best book ever!
- Yes!
What is going on?
Yeah. No, wait.
Imagine this, okay?
Um, so, me sitting on a plane,
you know,
reading our little book...
and, well, this, um,
devilishly handsome man...
My God, is this going
where I hope it is?
Yes, it is. You know what he did?
He asked me out to dinner.
Well, that's not exactly...
- Shh!
- You met a man on an airplane?
Yeah, and guess what? A pilot!
Love a man in uniform.
Your husband just died!
Harry. Yeah.
My goodness. He was...
He was such a good man.
That was the best thing
that ever happened to you.
Harry dying was the best thing that
ever happened to her?
Yeah, 'cause now she can have sex
with somebody who's not an accountant.
Wait a minute. Are you crazy?
Sex? Forget about it.
I don't even remember
how to have sex. No way!
Don't worry, it'll all come back.
It's just like riding a bicycle.
Except instead of riding a bicycle,
you have sex with a man.
Note to self: Watch Carol
ride a bicycle someday.
If you need a refresher,
I know somebody who sure
does know how to have sex.
I don't know what that is,
but I'll tell you one thing:
it is definitely not sex, okay?
No, you're right, that's not sex.
That's crazy hot sex.
Can we please stop saying "sex"?
What do you prefer, “make love"?
"I don't make love. I f--"
"Hard."
That's what he said.
- My.
- Ooh.
You've completely lost it.
- No, I think she's found it.
- Yeah.
She's found it.
Handcuffed in the red room, right?
- The whip.
- The red room.
Bruce must be having
such fun with all this.
Yes, such fun, actually. Yeah.
What is that?
This book made me realize that
it's been quite a while
since we-- you know.
As in... as in weeks?
Like, maybe six.
- Six weeks?
- Months.
God, I thought you guys
were like rabbits.
We are, if rabbits
took a ton of Benadryl
and made a chastity pact.
My God, we have
to put a stop to this.
Come on.
I mean, if women our age
were meant to have sex,
God wouldn't do
what he does to our bodies.
Whoa! Well, speak for yourself.
That was not God.
That was Dr. Nazarian.
He did a good job.
Hey, everyone.
- Hey!
- What's the topic this month?
- W hat...
- Moby Dick.
Yeah, sounds like fun.
- Carol?
- What?
You are not gonna believe
what I pulled out of the garage.
My old motorcycle.
That poor thing
hasn't been ridden in ages!
Poor thing.
There's a little sag in the cable.
She's still got a gorgeous chassis.
You know, I was thinking
maybe I could lube her up
and get that old gal riding again.
- Yeah, yeah, good idea.
- That's good.
Give her undercarriage a good buff
and slap a little wax on her saddle.
Ooh,
I hope he uses protection.
- Shut up.
- Moby Dick?
- What was that?
- I don't know.
I don't know why my mind
keeps going there.
It's like, duh.
Ladies, this book is a wakeup call.
I don't care what society says
about women our age.
Sex must not be taken off the table.
Hold on. I mean, we are four
smart successful women.
I don't need a man.
I know. You've proved that
for 18 years.
Touché.
No, my point is,
the choice should be ours.
Speaking of which,
we are doubling down.
How about this for a choice?
- Thank God it's a trilogy.
- My God!
- Especially for you, Sharon.
- Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you. Ladies?
- What?
- Ladies?
- Yes?
- Yes')
We shall not go gentle
into that good night.
So, let's lube up those bikes
and get riding again!
"I groan and tilt my pelvis
involuntarily against him,
finding a delicious...“
"...a delicious friction..."
This is really something.
"...against the seam of his fly
and his growing erection."
Dear. My God, okay, okay.
- Hello?
- Are you okay?
You were supposed
to call me after dinner.
Yeah, I'm fine, honey. I just finished.
Did you eat alone?
Yes, alone.
God, it's all so sad.
Yeah. Okay, but anyway...
thanks for checking in,
and I really should get to bed.
Remember,
we can put you in the basement
whenever you're ready.
Okay.
Whoa.
I mean...
Wow, wow.
Hello!
Is that really
how you answer the phone?
- All right, who is this?
- I'm gonna hang up now.
Then I'll call you back
and we're gonna try this again.
My God.
It's over.
I can't do anything right,
obviously. Okay.
Hello there!
Hey, hello there. Much better.
Have you had dinner?
I have. Yeah.
How about tomorrow night?
Dinner tomorrow night?
Sounds great.
Thought you'd never ask.
What time should I pick you up?
But I... I really can't, so...
- Why can't you?
- No, I mean--
I mean, of course I can,
but where are you anyway?
I'm in Sedona.
But I'm in... 
I'm in Santa Monica, so...
I'm aware. I'll pick you up at 6:30.
Well, wait. But you can't
just kind of like...
Actually, I can.
I'll see you tomorrow night.
God.
Dear.
Someone make a bad wish?
You should know
I rescue wishes all over town.
Wanna grab a cup of coffee?
I-- I can't today.
Well, I'd like to grab a drink sometime.
We have an excellent bar
on the mezzanine level.
You meant with me?
You're funny.
Okay, it's a date, then.
I love that you have a date!
Yeah, and it's a first date.
So it's important
that you put on something sexy.
I don't own anything sexy.
Don't listen to her.
Just be comfortable.
Be yourself.
Okay. Well, what about...
Does this...
- That's too comfortable.
- Right, yeah, no. No.
Okay, fine.
I can take that to Goodwill for you.
Don't do that to them.
Those people have enough trouble.
- She always does this.
- I know.
She wears these voluminous things
to cover that beautiful figure.
All the time!
- My God!
- 'Yes!
- Perfect! You look great!
- You look perfect.
- Let me see.
- I don't want...
My God, you look so good.
Unbutton one little button here.
- Show off the girls.
- Get off!
Let them out!
No, no, no.
- This is so ridiculous.
- So exciting.
I can't believe how nervous I am.
I am, too.
Do you remember your last date?
We're talking Nixon era.
- Wait, is that helping?
- No.
God.
I need a safe word.
You're gonna be great!
You're gonna be great.
- This is gonna be amazing!
- Let's get to the window.
Just act natural. Showtime!
- Well, hey, you.
- Good, you're home.
- He's wearing jeans.
- I love a man in jeans.
Let me see. Okay...
- He's got a cute tush.
- God!
God.
Um...
- You brought me flowers?
- Here you go.
Thank you so much.
He brought flowers!
I love a man
who brings flowers.
If you don't like them,
blame your neighbors.
- I picked them from their garden.
- You're kidding.
The last time she went
on a date, she got pregnant.
I don't think
that's gonna happen this time.
- He gave up on you.
- I know. That's okay.
- So, where were we?
- Yeah, a bathroom.
A public bathroom?
Like, a public bathroom?
Yeah, like in a park.
- In a park?
- Well, yes, I was 11.
The setting wasn't the first thing
on my mind.
No.
- What about you?
- Me? I don't remember.
Everybody remembers their first kiss.
How about I tell you
about my best kiss?
Maybe that hasn't happened yet.
I see. Well.
My first kiss.
That'd be the sixth grade
and Terry Sanders.
Terry Sanders.
Is that a boy or a girl?
A boy, obviously.
I don't know.
Anyway, it was one
of those Christmas mixers.
Some friends and I,
we snuck backstage.
It was dark, and...
I remember hearing the first
bluesy notes of “At Last."
Remember? By Etta James?
And it came billowing down
through the curtains,
and that is when Terry Sanders
came up to me, and he said...
It was so sweet! He said,
"I think I love you, Dee-Dee."
Yeah, and then he grabbed
my face with both of his hands,
and he was like, I don't know...
Maybe he had seen it
in some movie or something.
But he held my face,
and, for a moment,
my mind went completely blank
in the greatest possible way.
God. I mean, we didn't...
We didn't know
what we were doing, we just...
- Terry knew.
- Maybe, yeah.
We stood there like that, you know...
We just stood there. Frozen.
And you know, I didn't really care.
Because...
the feeling of his hands on my face...
You know what I wish? I wish...
everyone had a first kiss like that.
Yeah.
I'm so sorry.
You know, I don't...
I don't know why I told you
the whole story!
That was a beautiful--
That was a beautiful story.
Thank you.
I wish I was kissed by Terry Sanders.
Where is he? Whatever happened
to Terry Sanders?
- I need to track him down.
- Terry Sanders...
No, what actually happened to him
was that he died in a plane crash.
He died, yeah.
He just went like that.
- Plane crash?
- Yeah.
No.
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
He didn't die in a plane crash.
You've been waiting all this time
just to hit me with a plane crash joke.
I couldn't help it.
Diane can get a man
to fly in from another state,
and I can't get my husband
to come in from the garage!
Well, you have to give him
a good enough reason.
Well, since when is sex not
a good enough reason for a man?
Honey, you're not dealing with a man,
you're dealing with an older man.
Different animal.
He's not thinking about sex.
He's conditioned to think
that “inside" means changing
a light bulb or fixing the toilet.
Both of which sound infinitely
more satisfying to me.
So basically, I'm screwed.
Or not screwed, as it were.
He needs a reminder.
Take him back to a time
when sex was on his mind.
- Miss O'Donnell?
- Yeah.
This was dropped
at the desk for you.
- Thank you, Runako.
- You're welcome.
It's Pavlovian.
Present the right stimulus,
you will not believe
how quickly he'll come.
Must you always be so crass?
Look whose mind is in the gutter!
I know!
It's because of this book.
The whipping and the flogging.
I'm learning things no one our age
should even know about!
I mean, sex is...
Not that a little kissing or petting
would kill me, but--
Is that a poncho?
Um... all right, sharing.
"Next time we should wear protection"?
"Love, Arthur."
You weren't gonna
tell us about this.
I told you we went out for coffee.
Unbelievable! That is not
how I go out for coffee.
The entire world is coupling up.
You just need to put yourself
out there the same way Tom did.
You see her going online?
I mean, let's not lose
all our sense of reality.
Well, why not?
There are plenty of fish in the sea
- who would adore her.
- I agree.
But to catch one she'd actually have
to take out a pole
and make her way down to the water.
You really don't think I can do it.
Well, I think you can.
I just don't think you will.
Then let's drink to me
and my pole going online.
- Well, yay! Good for you.
- Yay!
But you might want to lose the pole.
Yeah. Good call.
Life motto?
I'll give you a life motto.
"No one with a life has a motto."
"Find a mate?“
What am I, Lin-Lin the Panda
at the San Diego Zoo?
No! No, no, no.
Stop it!
Shit!
My old uniform. What do you think?
I feel like I'm in a time machine.
I know. And it still fits!
Ta-da!
There's some duct tape on the shelf.
You're sweet, but that
just makes it easier to...
You need--
you need duct tape. Okay...
And, give me the zip ties.
Zip ties.
Are you thinking about tying me up?
What?
Nothing. It's just something
I was reading about.
Is there anything else
I can do for you?
No, I think I'm good, thanks.
I just needed more light
before I can get inside her crankshaft.
Check her out.
Check out... your motorcycle?
Yeah.
- It sure brings back memories.
- Yeah.
And she's a lot prettier
than I remember.
I wouldn't complain
if you want to take me for a ride.
Rain check?
I'm sorry. I talked your ear off.
- I'll recover.
- You will? I wonder.
Just let me know
when you're back in Arizona.
Well, actually, I'm going
to be there this weekend.
How inconvenient.
How inconvenient, yeah.
Anyway...
- It was really lovely.
- It was really lovely. So...
- Good night.
- Have a good night.
Okay, thank you. Thank you.
God.
We need to get control
of this situation.
I don't want a repeat
of what was going on
in the evidentiary hearing.
Let's turn our phones off, please.
Not mine.
Am I the only one hearing this?
I believe it's from... over there.
Holy shit.
Here, Ginsburg, you want to go out?
Go.
Go ahead.
Okay, fine.
Be lethargic.
Damn you, E.L. James.
His name is George
and he's probably a serial killer.
No man is perfect.
Well, he's also certainly not normal.
I mean, normal people
don't go trolling for dates online.
You do.
Yeah, I rest my case.
Maybe he's your Christian Grey.
- He's a bald tax attorney.
- Okay, maybe not.
But at least you have a date.
I'm never gonna have sex again
for the rest of my life.
He might not even have arms!
- Hey.
- What?
These are essential.
They hold you in,
smooth everything down. Life changing.
I'm gonna get them for you.
Come here.
Well, let's just say things did not go
exactly as planned.
You've been married too long.
In the army, when they want
to get a soldier's attention,
they just blow on the trumpet.
Well, that is precisely
what I was attempting.
- And the soldier?
- Absent without leave.
In fact, the trumpet never even
came out of the barracks.
The commanding officer
put a kibosh on the mission?
Yes. Mission aborted.
Jesus Christ,
enough with the metaphors already.
My organs just shifted.
You're gonna be fine.
Do scuba breathing.
So, okay, give him one of these...
and the lieutenant
will stand at attention.
You think that's the problem?
I've been doing field research
on this demographic a long time.
He's probably just embarrassed.
This is gonna be
a game changer, trust me.
You need some help?
I need the Jaws of Life.
Um, I don't think
you have that on quite right,
but it's gonna look amazing.
I look like a Lane Bryant mannequin.
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to picture your serial killer
trying to peel you out of that thing.
- He's gonna have to use his teeth.
- If he has teeth.
When you guys are finished joking,
can you get me some scissors?
I can't feel my feet.
Is that the one
I showed you?
No. Found it on Zillow.
Check it out.
- This has a media room.
- Sick.
You don't need a media room,
you need your son to live
in a good school district.
Mom. You shouldn't be adding salt.
It's spaghetti. I always
add salt to my spaghetti.
Mom, did you not get the article
I sent you on blood pressure?
Shoot. Could-- Could you
excuse me forjust a sec?
Don't say “sick". You're 40 years old.
Hi, how are you?
Come visit you? That's crazy!
What? Well, I don't know
how I can do that, you know?
Yeah?
Well, okay.
I'm just gonna have
to come up with a reason.
- Mom?
- I got to go.
Okay, yes, and I will. Okay, bye.
- ls everything okay?
- No. No.
That was my neighbor. And, um...
There was a robber,
or a burglar, I don't know.
Anyway, they think
that the house was burgled!
- Burgled?
- It's shocking!
But you know something? I think
I need to get back there ASAP to help.
What do you mean, help?
What I mean is the authorities--
they may want to ask some questions.
So I do need to get back there now.
The authorities?
I'm not a suspect. I'm not suspicious.
It's not that kind of thing.
But I'm so worried.
This world is just not
a safe place for you anymore.
I'm sorry, and...
I'm really gonna try
to keep that in my mind, okay?
But anyway, I need to book
a flight back tomorrow.
Do I just not turn you on anymore?
I mean, I get it after 35 years
and three kids, but am I...
Is it just not exciting anymore?
I love you, Carol.
I know you love me,
and I love you.
Then what is the problem?
The problem is we haven't
even tried to make love
since your retirement party.
And we both know
how that turned out.
You yourself said
there was something wrong
with the lamb that night.
We both know there was
nothing wrong with the lamb.
I'm the one who made it.
I'm not having this conversation.
Bruce, Vivian said
that it is so normal for men--
Wait. Vivian?
Dr. Schaefer said there are
safe and effective ways--
You talked to Dr. Schaefer'?
I did not think
you'd want to talk to him.
- I don't want to talk to him!
- See? I knew that! I knew that!
He asked me,
"Does he still pleasure himself?“
- My God!
- And I said, “I have no idea!“
Carol! This is enough!
Bruce! I want to have sex!
Hello.
Excuse me.
Okay, come on, baby.
Get your leg up there.
Goddang it.
Come on.
What, you can't
get it turned on?
Hi. Do you have a reservation?
No, actually I'm meeting someone.
His name is George.
He's a tax accountant.
Right. Follow me.
Enjoy your meal.
Hey, you have arms!
It would've been fine
if you didn't, but it's...
better that you do. Hey.
So nice to... Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'll take care of it.
This is why I don't leave the house.
- Shall we start again?
- I'm afraid to reenter.
Nah.
We can take it right from here.
Okay.
So, what about you?
- You work?
- Um, yes.
Actually, I'm currently working
on my drinking.
You have a nice laugh.
Thank you.
Actually, I'm a federal judge.
Wow.
- Really?
- Yeah.
And I do have the power
to put you in handcuffs.
I don't know
why I said that. Really.
I'm sorry. I--
I was guessing what you might be
thinking and...
I mean, not you, but men.
Not like all men
think the same, but...
I'm sorry I'm not better at this,
but this is...
Whoa.
Can I make a confession?
I changed
my shirt today six times
and I only have five shirts.
And the irony is
that they're all exactly alike.
Blue, button-down, Brooks Brothers.
Well, who doesn't love Brooks Brothers?
Not this guy.
When did dating get so complicated?
I mean, it used to be
you'd go to a dance
and bada-boom bada-bing,
you'd get married and pregnant.
Now you have to come up with
earth-shattering theories on life
before you even get a "wink."
What is that, a "wink“ online?
You know, you are so much better
at this than you think you are.
Thank you.
You are too, for the record.
All my past relationships
taught me one thing.
I can't sleep with men.
Well, now, there's a revelation
I was not expecting.
No, but sex is fine.
I just can't sleep.
Okay, that makes more sense.
Now I can focus on
what you're gonna say next.
I can't understand
how men can sleep anywhere.
On the floor, in a bed, on a couch.
I'm staring at the ceiling
and they're off
in some blissful dreamscape.
Well, they say that bad sleep
is a sign of a bad relationship.
Yeah, well, I can attest to that.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Wow.
I never thought
I'd be back here again.
Me, neither.
Here we go.
- Is it as good as you remember?
- Maybe better.
Let me ask you a question.
What's your favorite thing
in the whole world?
Well, that's a very broad question.
Um...
Arm tickles.
- Come on.
- No, without a doubt.
No, it's true.
I'm a girl of simple pleasures.
Says the girl
with a staff of 150!
But it would be so much better
if they were all tickling my arms.
You know what I love to do
that I never do anymore?
Listen to a full album on vinyl
from beginning to end.
Vinyl sure has made
a comeback, hasn't it?
Well, some things
stand the test of time.
That they do.
Dance is about connection.
It can't just be routine.
Moving in unison
is not the same as dancing.
Right.
I think
we're done for the night.
Sorry.
I was 14. She was 17.
She could drive a car.
And she was sitting behind the wheel.
She said, “Come here.“
This is me.
Thank you for making tonight so easy.
...It was a great, great pleasure.
Um, I have to ask you this.
First of all, I think you're great.
And second,
I know that the chances of this
going past this evening are slim, but...
would you mind if I...
kissed you?
If I had a nickel
for every time
someone asked me that.
All right, all right. I'll just rewind
the tape about 3O seconds.
Shut up and kiss me.
Hell.
I think this belongs to you.
Thank you.
Ginsburger!
Ooh. I'm gonna need
a bigger back seat.
Paging Dr. Derek.
Is this good?
This is fine, this is totally fine.
Okay.
I love how your generation
still feels the need
to get fancy for air travel.
It's so cute.
Okay...
- Call me when you get back to L.A.
- Of course.
- I love you.
- I love you, too.
- Be safe.
- Bye-bye.
- Love you.
- Love you!
Quite an escape, Houdini.
God. I can't believe I'm doing this.
You know, I can't get over it.
Honestly, I'm not sure
I've ever seen a prettier sky.
Right?
- Cheers.
- Cheers, okay.
Boom.
Can I show you something?
- Sure.
- Come with me.
What are we doing? Wait.
- Are you nervous?
- ...Should I be?
I'm not sure I've ever met anybody
who owned their own barn before.
You got to get out
of the city more often.
No, wait, no.
Forget it.
There is no chance in hell
I'm getting into that thing.
No. No!
You're gonna love it.
It's gonna be great.
I'm sorry, but...
What are you talking about?
No, I'm not getting in there.
These are the controls.
Don't touch anything.
If you touch it, we'll crash.
- Don't say that.
- I'm kidding.
This is my baby, okay?
See that "B“ there? You see?
- It's a Beechcraft Bonanza V-Tail.
- Okay.
And it's been my passion project
for the last...
20 years.
Twenty years! Wait a minute.
How old is this thing?
- It's a 1951.
- Whoa!
I'm a 1951! Let me out of here!
No, seriously.
- Okay, we're going up.
- Wait, no.
I'm gonna regret this!
Please. No, no, you have
a death wish. Death wish!
- Please.
- We're all gonna die someday, Diane.
I just feel like it's worth living
a little bit while we still can.
Overwhelming?
Wanna hold on to the...
- Okay.
- Just hold on to it.
I'll hold on.
- No!
- See that?
Yes.
No, that's...
- I'm gonna bank, to the right.
- You're gonna bank?
You know what that is?
Yes. That's Cathedral Rock.
That's right.
My God.
And all this, though,
from being a pilot
-is what you're saying, right? This?
- No.
- No?
- No, what happened was
I got out of the Air Force,
and I went to work for this
aeronautical research lab.
And, you know, I came up
with this design that...
that reduced engine drag in a jet.
It's silly, but it's a big patent,
and this is what happened
right here. See?
You're gonna have
to introduce me to your family.
When can I meet them?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why?
Because they're still very sensitive
about their father and...
What about you?
Well, I'm... I mean, I loved him.
But I guess I realized
I was in mourning
for the end of something.
It's been a long time.
I mean, I guess, I don't know,
the world sees your...
your relationship in one way,
you just kind of go along, but...
then the truth is...
it had been over between us
for a long time.
So...
what do you think of that?
You don't want to hear
my sad story, do you?
Maybe you should tell me yours.
I don't have a sad story.
You don't have a sad story
'cause you're rich.
It's been 24 hours
and there's still no answer.
Okay, I'm sure she's fine.
You're so sure everything is fine!
She could be passed out
in a ditch somewhere!
Adrianne, please calm down.
- I'm calling Jill.
- You're being hormonal!
Sharon, is that you?
Tom? Hi.
Wow! Hi!
Hi...
- Unexpected.
- Yeah.
Your hair's... dark.
It's dyed.
- I know.
- Right, right.
I want to introduce you to someone.
Actually, I have to--
Babe! Come here.
Babe, babe,
I want you to meet Sharon.
Sharon, this is my fiancée, Cheryl.
It is so nice to meet you!
I've heard so much about you.
Sharon?
Excuse me, are you Sharon?
- Yeah.
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
I was in a complicated sinus surgery.
Don't ask.
Hi, I'm Dr. Derek.
You can just call me Derek.
Hi, I'm Tom.
- Kill me now.
- I'm sorry, who are you?
Dr. Derek. Derek. Sharon's date.
- Wow.
- Hi. I am Cheryl.
I didn't know you were seeing someone.
That's great.
You look so amazing
without your mask!
How sweet.
You should bring Dr. Derek
to the party next week.
- What?
- The double-engagement party.
Didn't Jared tell you?
Cheryl and I got engaged.
We've having a little celebration
with our friends.
But it really is for Jared and Kate.
- We would so love to have you.
- Yes.
- And you, too, Doctor.
- Yeah.
Well, that sounds so nice!
Say, do you need a DJ?
I do that on the side.
- Ooh!
“Ooh!
Do you do the vinyl
or what do you do, CDs?
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You sure you're okay in the bar?
Yeah. It's gonna be like
the good old days.
Cheers.
Ha! Am I ever.
Inner goddess doing
the merengue, my ass!
So is this where you take all the boys?
Only the ones I don't want
to be seen with at the bar.
Well, I'll choose
to take that as a compliment.
Restricted area?
Owner's perks.
Look at this.
A single solitary chair.
It's all a girl needs.
It's like a queen's throne
atop her castle.
Look. Look at the view.
Yeah. Look at
all those twinkling lights.
All those lives being lived.
As the poem goes,
you took the road less traveled,
and it made... all the difference.
You know, that's not really
what that poem is about.
- Is that right?
- No.
It's, um...
It's about how we--
we tell the story of our lives,
so we feel heroic, brave...
but in fact, there's no difference
in the paths to begin with.
- No difference in the paths?
- Nope.
Fascinating poem.
Arthur, come here.
Look at this. You see that
building with the red lights?
- Is that our diner?
- Yeah.
I can't believe your hotel
overlooks our favorite place.
According to the airline,
your mother never boarded her flight.
- My God.
- You said not to worry about it!
- Okay, you can worry now.
- What?
However...
we did trace a signal
to her cell phone.
- What?
- Okay.
- What does that mean?
- We know where she is.
- She's been kidnapped?
- I did not say that.
- Is there a ransom?
- You know where she is?
In a case like this,
it's best to remain calm.
- Let's get a grip, folks.
- You know where she is?
If you had to guess,
what would you say?
I don't have to guess,
I actually know.
- Well, then take us there!
- Can I see the pad?
I can't believe
you put Viagra in my beer.
Well, it was an innocent mistake.
Innocent. How is it innocent?
You poisoned me.
Hardly.
Do not use that word.
- I'm sorry. How does it feel?
- Hard!
I thought we weren't
gonna use that word.
I can, you can't.
- God, there are so many rules.
- Don't, Carol!
Jeez.
I'll tell you something,
I don't think it ought to go to waste.
- Seriously! Stop it.
- Calm down.
Really? I'm being pulled over.
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the vehicle.
I don't think that's
a good idea, Officer.
Out of the car now!
Okay, okay.
Gosh darn it.
Man.
Look, I'm sorry.
My wife put Viagra in my drink.
It's actually true.
It's my bad, I'm so sorry.
But you see, it's just he's been
having a little trouble
in that department,
and he was embarrassed.
And if there's one thing
I know about this man,
it's that he really hates
to be embarrassed.
Isn't that true, Pup?
I hate a lot of things right now.
That's not even in the top three.
Will this affect your ability to drive?
No, ma'am.
Okay.
- Er1j0y your night.
- Okay.
You, too.
Thank you.
I think I like you.
Well, I think that's probably
just the wine talking, right?
Wait.
You know what?
I think I'm in trouble here.
- I'm well past trouble.
- Yeah?
What?
I think I heard something.
It's probably just
the wine talking, right?
And how often does the wine
talk in your world?
My God. Wait, who-- who is that?
- Mom?
- Boy.
- My God.
- My God.
My God!
My God! Mom!
Honey, let me explain.
What the heck is happening here?
Hi. You must be, 
Adrianne and Jill.
I'm Mitchell.
- Chris.
- Stop it!
Mitchell, can you just...
You Okay?
- Mom!
- No, please. No, I'm fine.
Just let me explain, okay?
I'll be right back.
Wait, where are you going?
She's okay. She's perfectly...
She was in good hands. Relax.
- You relax!
- No, it's okay.
- You relax!
- We've had a long day. I'm sorry.
I was just trying to give us
a little jumpstart.
I thought maybe if we had
a really nice night
and things sort of
naturally progressed,
then maybe
we would both feel better.
Great plan! Congratulations
on the execution.
Sorry. I really was just
trying to help you, Bruce.
Help me?
By never once considering
that I might have an opinion!
No, it's not just tonight.
It's everything, Carol!
You've got me taking dance lessons.
Dance lessons for a talent show
that I never even signed up for!
You've been going to my
No Kid Hungry fundraiser
for the past 15 years.
You always show up for me.
That was for dinner.
Well, forgive me for trying to find ways
to keep us connected.
"Hey, Bruce, here's something
you're gonna hate to do
for the next two months,
but in the end it'll be okay
because there will be
an onstage public shaming!
So happy anniversary!"
What, what? Sorry, sorry.
Didn't hear you at all,
because my husband
gave me these wonderful earplugs,
so we wouldn't have to listen
to each other anymore.
Happy anniversary!
Hey, and by the way,
I got us the earplugs
so you wouldn't miss
any of your TV shows,
just because I happen
to love to fall asleep
next to my wife in our bed!
So forgive me!
Okay, what are you doing?
Come on.
Diane, I know this--
I know this is not the direction
we hoped for this evening.
This is... It's such a disaster!
Do you see what I mean?
You've got to admit it was kind of funny.
A cop showed up!
No, it wasn't kind of funny.
This whole thing
is just one giant mistake.
You don't believe that.
I get that it's embarrassing,
but who gives a shit?
No, you know what?
You don't get it, Mitchell.
You know why?
Because you don't have kids.
Kids? They're like adults, your kids.
You know,
you're out here on your ranch,
with no one to take care of but yourself.
Okay, that's fine for you,
but that's not the real world.
I have a family
and I have responsibilities.
- I'm sorry, but that's my world.
- I'm sure I don't understand
everything you're
going through right now.
That's right. You don't have a clue.
Listen to me. Look at me.
I know we just met.
But you can't spend your entire life
just going around
taking care of other people.
That's also not part of the real world.
Okay, hey!
- Diane.
- What? What?
I'm saying it's okay
to be happy, Diane.
Well, I'm really...
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
Bruce. Bruce, honey.
What?
I know I've been acting
a little crazy lately.
And obviously
I went overboard tonight.
Really?
My gosh, I hadn't noticed.
I am so sorry.
I embarrassed you...
and I made you feel
like you didn't matter.
I just don't know
what's been going on with you
for the last few months
and it scares me.
I know what I did was wrong, and...
I'm sorry.
I got spooked.
Spooked?
Yeah, at the...
retirement party.
You know, I saw...
40 years just... vanish.
And I didn't know
who I was anymore.
Well, what was I gonna do?
What can I do?
I got scared.
I am scared.
And I need a little time
to figure out who I am again.
I hear you.
And I'm not gonna try
to fix everything on my own...
tempting though that may be.
And I'm not gonna make you do
a bunch of stuff
that you don't want to do,
like dancing at the fundraiser.
I know you never wanted to do that.
So forget it, okay?
I'm going to bed.
Whoa, ice cream
straight from the tub?
Yeah, well, I ran into Tom
and his very happy fiancée.
They're hosting
a double-engagement party
at their house.
Did I mention he calls her "babe"?
Which is sort of perfect
since she's a child.
- No.
- Yeah.
What did I miss?
Well, Sharon is never dating again.
And we're all miserable.
So basically nothing has changed.
Yeah, well...
Whoa. Since when
do you eat ice cream?
Since now.
So I take it things
went south for you, too?
I slept with Arthur.
Now, there's a shocker.
No, not sex.
I actually fell asleep with him.
You've never been able
to sleep with a man before!
I know.
So, I mean...
you didn't have sex?
We slept on a couch
and he tickled my arm.
Boy, now this is a disaster.
When is he leaving?
Not soon enough!
God, I got a brain freeze.
Here, give that to a professional.
My God!
Well, anyway,
I have an announcement.
Okay.
I am...
I'm officially... moving to Arizona.
- What?
- Tell me it's for the pilot!
No, no, no.
For my daughters.
This has gone from bad to worse!
Well, I mean, they renovated
the basement for me,
and everything is slip resistant,
and I can walk into the tub.
- My God.
- lck.
But what about the pilot?
Crashed and burned.
I mean, we're not 18 anymore.
Nope.
We're sure not spring flowers.
No. More like potpourri.
So, this is...
My God,
this is my last book club!
No, you're kidding!
Diane!
Do we even want to talk
about the book?
- I hate this book, okay? Done.
- Me, too.
Yeah.
Are we really this pathetic?
None of us have
anything interesting to say?
Well, my little affair
ended with me in a pool
on top of an inflatable swan
and my daughters showing up
with the police!
Well, that certainly
qualifies as interesting.
I'm assuming
you were not in that pool alone.
Well... I was not.
Good for you.
Do I want to get us
another one of these?
- Yeah.
- Yes!
The sooner the better.
Men make life impossible.
God, tell me about it.
Well, you're one to talk.
Ditching God's gift to women
so you can live in a basement
and breastfeed
your daughter's children?
You know something?
That's really rich coming from you.
You've been stuck on Torn
for 18 years,
and you don't even like the guy.
He's not at your level.
Eighteen years ago,
you couldn't wait to get rid of him.
But you've conveniently erased
that little piece of history.
Wish I could erase
a little piece of my history.
- Well...
- What?
I was fine until Arthur came along.
I had a happy existence.
Had a roster of men
that would satisfy my every whim.
My God,
I can't listen to this anymore.
You really believe you're satisfied?
How could you be?
You're so terrified of getting hurt
that you do everything you can
to push away love.
I'm gonna go back
to having sex and not caring.
Because that's what
works for me, okay?
Stop lying to yourself, Vivian.
Not everything in the world
is about sex.
Did you even read the book?
This is a love story.
That is what the world wants.
That's what the world needs.
So, okay, you can have sex
with anybody.
Well, whoop-de-fricking-do.
But you know what?
Eventually, people need
a little bit more than that.
Everybody's got baggage
and pain and problems, but...
even Christian Grey fell in love.
Yeah, and he was
fifty shades of fucked-up.
So...
here you go.
Book three? I am not sure
we'll survive another one.
...God.
God, I...
I really am gonna miss this. Right?
Honey.
- Have a good drive.
- Thanks again.
Ginsburg.
What's happening here?
Honey?
What's happening?
Look at you.
Look at you.
Yeah, yeah. Look at you.
You're not taking my calls.
I don't have my phone with me.
Do you know why
I first started on radio?
No, I don't.
Because I loved the idea
of no matter what I said
or what music I played...
millions of people could just
turn on their radios and hear it.
But then as I got older...
I realized that...
reaching millions and millions
of anonymous people...
doesn't come close...
to reaching
just one person you love.
And I'm... I'm leaving tomorrow.
And it got me thinking...
wouldn't it be nice if...
you were coming with me
to New York?
But then I thought about it
and I thought about you...
and your hotel and your rooftop...
and your inability
to make proper wishes.
I have no interest
in trying to change you, Vivian.
I love who you are.
Rich and independent...
and a total pain in the ass.
That does sound like... like me.
And here we are,
staring at two paths.
And I know how I feel.
I know that you're the person
that I want to talk to.
You're the person I want to listen to.
You're the person I want
to splash in the fountain.
You're my person, Slim.
And I just wanted to know
what you thought about that.
It's-- It's been really nice
seeing you again, Arthur.
I hope you have a safe trip home.
- Hi.
-
-u.
Hi, everybody. I'd like to take
a second to say a few words.
As most of you know,
I'm Tom Meyers, Jared's dad.
On behalf of my fiancée,
Cheryl, and myself,
I want to thank you all for coming.
Kate, we're so excited t0 welcome you
and invite you into the family.
- Jared, we are so very happy for you.
- Thanks, Dad.
As Shakespeare said, "Love looks
not with the eyes but with the mind."
How right he was.
Love takes thought and care,
and I'm glad that
all the plus columns lined up.
Kate, you're getting
one of the good ones.
Aww...
Sorry, I said I wouldn't do this.
To Jared and Kate.
Cheers!
I didn't mean to do that, sorry.
Um, as-- as few...
Well, if any of you know,
I'm Jared's mother, Judge Meyers.
Or Sharon.
I just wanted to say,
I don't think that's what
Shakespeare had in mind
when he wrote those lines.
He was saying Cupid is blind.
He wasn't saying
that people should go
think themselves into love
and a system of pluses or minuses.
But whatever.
Anyway, when I look at my son...
I am so proud of him because...
he has had the courage
to put himself out there,
and he's found someone
to make him happy.
That's inspiring.
Even for someone as old as me.
The truth is...
love is not blind,
and it's not a battlefield,
and it's not the sun or the moon
or everything we load onto it.
It's just a word
until someone gives it meaning.
And that's what the two of you
have found in each other.
In fact, all four of you.
And we all deserve that.
Well done.
Cheers!
Kate and Jared.
Hello?
Miss O'Donnell,
I'm calling to confirm
that Mr. Riley
has officially checked out.
Thank you.
Hi, sweetie.
Hey.
What happened? We've been
trying to call all afternoon.
What, you're still in a robe?
Carol's show starts in an hour.
I saw Arthur last night.
Fun.
No! I broke up with him
once and for all.
- I did.
- What happened?
He told me he wanted to invite me
to move to New York with him,
but he realized
he didn't want to change me
because he loves me the way I am.
And he only wants to talk to me,
and he only wants to listen to me.
He told me I was his person.
I'm sorry. I mean,
I'm not actually following here.
No, me, neither.
You said that he loves you...
as you are?
He doesn't want to change you?
And he wanted to know your thoughts?
- So you broke up with him?
- Well, yeah, exactly! Duh.
Are you out of your mind?
Okay, where is he?
He checked out
and he's on his way to New York.
Okay. Okay.
Time to get dressed.
Yup. That's it, Viv,
you're going after him.
- Get up, get up.
- No! My God.
What time is his flight?
Never mind, I'll figure it out.
She has to put on something sexy.
Everything she owns is sexy!
I can't... God! It is so yucky,
and this is so needy!
Sharon, I am not desperate.
No, you are not. You are stupid.
No, I am not.
You just-- You don't understand.
I know how this story ends,
and I do not like it.
If he has me, he's gonna get bored.
He hasn't seen me naked in 4O years!
I know. I'm sorry. My God...
I'm no fool! I know what happens.
He's gonna cheat on me
and leave me for a younger woman.
And then I'm gonna lose everything.
And it's just-- it's not worth it!
- Okay, baby, there you go.
- It isn't worth it.
I'm so sorry. I'm very sorry.
But it had to be done, all right?
- It's okay.
- His flight leaves in an hour.
- God, are you sure?
- Yes.
Okay, earrings! Time to go.
- Do I look okay?
- Yes, you look great.
The girls.
- You want me to put those on?
- Yep. Go.
G -Okay!
' °' 9°, 90. go!
I put a lipstick and compact in there.
That's so great!
Thanks.
- My God, do I look okay?
- Yes! Yes.
- Here we go.
- Bye!
- Bye.
- Bye_
My shoes.
And Carol, your show!
God, don't be ridiculous.
And Diane... you're leaving!
My God, you're leaving.
What am I gonna do?
Shoes!
God, thank you, guys.
I love you so much.
To the airport, Mario!
Okay, that's scary.
You're gonna do great!
Gonna do great.
And that was Jed and Leyla
Sanderson performing!
Hard to believe
she's an anesthesiologist.
Arthur, it's Vivian. Call me back
before you board your plane.
Mario, are you using Waze?
Yes, Miss O'Donnell,
but I don't think we're gonna make it.
And last but not least,
everyone's favorite chef
and our fearless organizer.
Dancing a solo will be...
Carol Colby!
Wait. No, no, wait. Sorry.
That's not the right song.
It's supposed to be
"Red, Red Robin Goes Bob, Bob--"
Shoot. Meat Loaf? Come on!
Aw, screw it.
My God, she's tap dancing
to Meat Loaf!
And she's pulling it off!
Bruce!
Five, six, seven, eight...
My God.
My, my!
How about those Colbys?
A romantic way to end the show.
God, I can't believe you're here.
I couldn't miss a chance
to dance with my girl.
- You were incredible.
- No, I wasn't.
None of our steps
go with Meat Loaf.
Who needs the steps?
We were dancing.
I'm sorry. Your cell phone
is poking me.
No, I didn't bring my cell phone.
You want to go home now? What do you say?
- I say yes.
- Okay.
Arthur!
I thought you left.
I did.
I went to the airport to try t0 see you.
Why are you here?
I realized I...
forgot to give you back your penny.
Why did you go to the airport?
I realized I wanted my penny back.
See, I tried to live without it
for-- for the past 4O years.
And I didn't like it.
Do you want to make a wish?
I do.
My God, you probably killed someone.
There's a subroof.
Nancy in my office,
she's in a book club,
and I thought
you might like to meet her.
Well, that's... that's very sweet.
Anyone else want
another piece of pizza?
I have one.
- Mom.
- What?
You're not hungry?
I guess not.
Well, I mean,
you're probably exhausted.
It's really not okay
that you drove here all by yourself.
At your age, Mom,
you could have killed somebody.
I really don't think so.
And the fact that you
don't even realize that
is what is so scary.
Jesus! Will you just...
Please stop, okay?
I mean, really!
My God.
Okay.
You know how proud I am
of both of you.
The greatest gift I think
a parent can give a child
is to lead by example,
and I don't think
I did a very good job.
But your father...
My goodness,
he was stable, wasn't he?
And smart and kind.
He was just a great dad.
Fine husband.
And we had a nice life.
But there's something...
I really have to say.
There's a man out there
who makes me feel things
that I didn't think were...
still possible.
You know what he does?
He makes me feel
curious and excited about the world.
And maybe things with us will go bust.
Maybe my feelings will be hurt,
but that's life.
And in spite of what
you both seem to think...
I'm not through living mine just yet.
I have things that I want to explore.
And guess what?
I think I've earned that right.
So it's time for all of this
to just stop, okay?
You both seem to have
very, very strong parenting instincts.
But do save it for your children
because your mother is doing just fine.
And...
I know I'm getting older.
But I'm still learning.
And one of the biggest
lessons I've learned
is not to be afraid to be happy.
I love you both.
But I'm not staying here anymore.
Mom...
Morn! Mom!
Have fun.
Love you.
- Love you, Mom.
- Love you.
- Drive safe!
- Bye!
Can I come in?
No way.
- No way?
- No way.
- What's in the U-Haul?
- Just my overnight bag.
My inner goddess says,
"Most definitely yes."
Yeah, yeah, I see the arms.
