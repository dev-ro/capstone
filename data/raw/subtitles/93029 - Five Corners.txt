Heinz is back. l just saw him .
Oh , he is?
You're trying to protect me?

This fish is a female fish .
So l don't want this one. l want that one.

So what?
So Heinz is back and l gotta get some protection .
l'll protect you .
You can't.
What, are you gonna go to the police?
They ain't gonna help you . He ain't done nothin'.
No, l ain't gonna go to the
cops. l'm gonna go to Harry.
Harry?
Yeah . That's who stopped him the last time.
But don't you know what Harry's

He ain't gonna help you with this.
We'll see about that.
Ain't you heard?
Harry's nonviolent now!
[horn honks]

support the fight for democracy around the world.
Vote for the man who believes extremism

the guy--the gentleman
from SNCC in Harlem this afternoon .
Excuse me, Harry, who belongs to this dog?
lt's my dog .
That's right. The Buddha belongs to you .
l cannot walk the Buddha.

Okay, l'll walk him .
Come here, Buddha boy.
[pulley squeaking]
Hey, Brita.

He'll be right back.
Do you want to come in and wait for him?
Sure, yeah .
Come on .
[plane drones by above]
Hello, Heinz.
Fuck you .
So they let you out.
l don't let no hair grow over to
hide this scar you gave me, Harry.
You should . You look like shit.
l don't wanna forget!
What? That some goon hit you
over the head with a beer pitcher?
lt don't seem like no golden memory to me.
Why don't you forget it?
l'm trying to forget it. l'm not proud of it.
l had a lot of time to think
when l was in that fucking hole.
Yeah , well , it's a shame you didn't use it.
Yeah ,
well--
why don't you go walk your dog?
Leave me to smoke my cigarette.
Look,
Heinz, l--
l wanna say something to you.
l love you .
l did a lotta soul searching while you were gone
l've had a lot of bad shit happen .
And l don't wanna do that caveman stuff no more.
l wanna help people.
You love me?
Yeah .
lt's funny how things are, you know.
How things are set up.
You're the first girl ever
to come here asking for Harry
and he's out walking the dog .
You know him from Fordham?
No, no, from the neighborhood .
lt's funny. l figured he'd go to school
meet some girl and get married .
And here he graduated in june
and he's still as single as he ever was. Right?
Right.
Well , l guess so. lt's. . .
He got so serious after his father died .
His father was a hero cop.
You get to be a hero cop by being killed .
Yeah . l know about that.
Why don't you sit down?
You with the student nonviolent Negro thing?
No.
Harry's got it in his head to be a hero, too.
Harry's gonna go down to M ississippi
him and a buncha other heroes.
Register Negroes for the vote.
Those hillbilly cops down there
with their third-grade educations and their shotguns
and their love of
the Negro people--
they're gonna welcome Harry the hero, my son
make him feel at home.
Maybe l should go.
l'm sorry.
He's packing his bag . lt was just on my mind .
Why do you wanna see Harry?
[doorbell rings]
Who's that?
Can l
help you--
(james) Excuse me. Excuse me, Mrs. Fitzgerald
but Linda's here, right?
james, what are you doing here?
l just figured it out. You got a thing for this guy.
This number about protection , that's just smoke.
You're throwing me over so's you can make a play
for Harry Fitzgerald .
Uh , your son .
Excuse me, M rs. Fitzgerald
but l'm in love with this girl .
She's pulling a number on me.
l figured it out, Linda. Tell me l'm wrong .
You're wrong .
Bull--hockey.
Maybe you don't understand what's going on .
Shall l explain it to you?
l wish you would .
This one here is my girl .
Last night she breaks up with me.
l feel bad . You could understand that.
Sure.
And she don't tell me why.
So today l'm eatin' my
heart out-- when l see Heinz.
Heinz?
Hei-- uh , bad boy from
way back. He busted my hip.
He tried to rape Linda, et cetera, et cetera.
Harry saved the situation .
lced Heinz completely with a pitcher of beer.
So, now she tells me she's breaking up with me
on account of Heinz being back.
You said that.
Ah , you didn't contradict me.
And that she's going to Harry for protection .
Now the whole world knows that Harry's
out to lunch with this Gandhi thing .
Would you like some coffee?
No, l think a cup of coffee right now
would give me a heart attack. Thank you .
So when l got a minute to think about it
l'm thinking it definitely don't add up.
And then , bam , l understand !
lt must be like she got obsessed for Harry Fitzgerald
and that she's using Heinz for smoke to blow on me.
Oh , james, please.
But what else could it be?
Would you like to sit down?
l can't sit down M rs. Fitzgerald
. l'm a man on the move.
Sit down !
[door opens]
What's this?
This? This is your life, clown .
[radio dispatch voices, indistinct]
Bud , hey, come and see me inside in 20 minutes.
[phone rings]
Good morning , Maxine.
Good morning .
Busy day, huh?
[station background chatter]
Why don't you wait a little
while, will ya? They'll turn up.
But neither of their own
mothers ain't heard from them .
Well , why ain't their own mothers down
here complaining about it then , huh?
Because they got a shitty attitude. Like you .
Oh , yeah? Well why don't you take a lesson from them
and just don't worry about it.
How's it going, Phil?
Good, Sully. What'd it look like?
Homicide.
Look, you gotta help me find these chicks, all right?
l feel responsible for them .
Well , go! Go and find 'em . Go with God .
Just leave me alone, will ya, for cryin' out loud?
Thirty-third Precinct.
So, it was really an arrow?
Yeah . Right in the back.
What do you make of that?
l ndians. What happened there? Somebody tag you?
No, it's a pimple.
You know there used to be lndians around here.
ls that right?
Sure. This whole area here was l
ndians. lt was called Keskeekek.
ls that right?
Sure.
Well, what happened?
What do you mean?
Why ain't they here now?
The neighborhood changed .
So who killed
this--what was he?
Algebra teacher. l don't know.
Heinz Sabatino's back on the street, you know.
Yeah , l know.
Think it might be him?
Maybe, but where did he learn
the art of the bow and arrow?
He could've picked it up in the pen .
Who from?
An l ndian . A camp counselor. l don't know.
So, uh , we moved in and the l ndians moved out.
That's right, the l ndians moved out
and a Dutch couple moved in .
Who were they?
They were the Bronx.
Something like John and Katrina Bronc.
People used to say, ''Let's go
over and visit the Broncs tonight.''
Boy, this is weird .
This is, like, the weirdest
thing that's ever happened to me.
lt's them .
(Brita) Who? The guys from last night?
Hi , Brita. You get some good sleep?
He knows my name. And he's French or something .
German .
German , huh?
ls that your apartment?
No, not exactly.
This is an apartment over which we have use.
Until the superintendent finds out!
Listen , somebody murdered our teacher
so we got the day off.
You wanna go for a ride?
A ride?
All right.
[lively chatter]

Oh, l know you did.
Maybe l didn't get 'em all the time
but l know you wrote your mother.
How's the asthma?
l ain't had asthma since l was twelve.
Yeah , you've been gone a long time.
Ooh , what a weird haircut.

My clothes still here?
Yeah .

[loud music starts again]
Look, you don't even know he's gonna bother you .
When l talked to him
today, it was like--
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You talked to Heinz?
Yeah . And l told him l loved him .
You told Heinz Sabatino you loved him?
Yeah, l did.
This is who you're going to for protection?
l'm sorry, Linda.
l gotta have a chuckle over this one.
This guy's further out than Sputnik.
Look, when you want my help, you know where to find me.
Harry, all the best in Mississippi.
lt ain't worth it being jealous with you .
You're a wacko and you're leaving town .
lt ain't worth it.
This is not a rival . This is a phenomenon .
You gotta excuse him .
He's just. . . he's just kinda nervous
about himself, you know?
lt's okay.
You saved him too, right?
l guess that makes him feel kinda weird .
He limps around and l , l guess he don't feel like a
you know, like enough of a man or something .
Hi , Ed .
What do you say?
Good afternoon , Esther.
Hi , Jimmy.
Quiet all day?
So far.
Ha, how's he doing?
One more, it's a knock.
What you drinking , Esther?
Nothing .
What was in that glass?
Hmmm . . . let's see.
No--that
one.
Uh , excuse me, Jimmy. l'm lookin' for Melanie.
Maybe you seen her?
No.
Nothing?
Look, l just got on .
All right. Thanks.
l understand , you got things you gotta do.
l'm just scared is all .
l guess that's my problem , though , right?
You probably won't even hear from the guy.
All that junk was a long time ago.
But what if l do hear from him?
All right, if you hear from him , call me.
Thanks.
Listen , uh , l'm probably only gonna be around
a couple more days
and then you're strictly on your own .
He probably won't bother you .
[laughs nervously]
All right, take it easy.
(Brita) She left the bag open for like two hours.
The glue was like a frigging' rock.
(Willie) What a shame.
Okay.
Okay what?
Whatnot Willie?
Whatnot.
This is a whatnot.
What's it for?
Watch . We're on the tenth floor, right?
Right.
So l push nine and--
can you hold this?
This?
Yeah
. And--
l put this here.
Come on . This is the ride l promised you .
This one is for us.
Oh there?
Come on . lt's a goof.
After you .
(Willie) Come on . Don't be afraid.
Oh .
Sit down .
So, what do we do now?
Now we wait.
Oh . They're gone.
They'll be back.
Melanie, dig this. lt's like outer space!
Yeah , it's like that down here too.
Ha!
Oh !
Hi !
Bye!
[unintelligible] .
[unintelligible]
[murmuring]
What you want, dear?
He don't want nothin', Nancy.
He's just crazy, right?
l'm meeting a couple friends.
Shoot. Ain't nobody got no friends in here, Sonny.
Hey, gimme
a dollar--
l may be able to get you outta here alive.
[laughter]
Hello, Arthur.
Hello, Brother Harold .
Sit down .
We haven't met,
have we, uh--?
You're not sure?
Um , l'm Harry Fitzgerald .
This is Brother Samuel Kemp.
He's been down in Mississippi
for us for a long time now.
He's been working with Brother Stokely Carmichael.
(waitress) Can l get you something?
Yeah , l'll have coffee, too. Black.
The purpose of the M ississippi Project is to, uh
get rich white kids working down there
beside those of us Negroes who've been beaten up enough
to satisfy a lifetime in the cause of The Movement
without the population up North getting upset about it.
Now, we figure if we can get these rich white kids
to get beat up in the cause of The Movement
that'll get the TV cameras rolling real good .
Here you go.
Thank you .
l , uh , l want you to like me, M r. Kemp.
l don't like you .
l don't like the idea of you .
What l mean is l want you to,
uh , approve me for this project.
l want to be
on that bus--
the day after tomorrow.
Why should l approve you?
Why should Brother Arthur here approve you?
Look at you .
You look to me like you're made out of sweet butter
and when that Mississippi sun lands on you
you're gonna melt down to nothing but grease.
They got State Troopers down there waiting for you , uh
Harvard types with a knife and fork.
Now, why don't you go home?
Um . . . huh . . .
l can understand if you don't like me, M r. Kemp.
l can . l , uh
l might not like you .
l don't know. Yet.
But lemme set you straight on a couple things.
l'm not rich .
l didn't go to Harvard.
l went to Fordham, which ain't Harvard.
And l come from a place in
the Bronx called Five Corners.
Now, The Movement has, has not been to this place.
lf a Negro, if you , for instance
were to walk through Five Corners
before you'd gone one block
people would come outta their houses
and stomp your ass into the ground .
Now, two years ago, l woulda been one of those people
but something
happened--
And. . l . . l had a change of heart.
You see,
my, uh--
[sigh]
my father was killed , my father was shot.
He was, he was a cop and he was shot by some kid
some crazy kid, and, uh
when l was sitting home with my mother
watching the news about it on TV
the next thing they showed after that
was Dr. Martin Luther King speaking .
And he was talking about the power of love
in the face of senseless cruelty and violence.
l heard him, Mr. Kemp.
l guess something knocked the wax outta my ears
'cause l heard him loud and clear.
And that's why l am sitting here now.
Was
this, uh--
kid who killed your father black?
You know, l don't remember.
(Melanie) Hey!
(Willie) Hey, you two!
What's up?
Hey. Come over on this one. We'll all be on one.
Yeah !
All right.
Come on , Melanie.
(Melanie) Oh , no.
l ain't walkin' around in here.
Don't be a chicken-ass,
Melanie. lt's like the sidewalk.
Come on .
(Castro) Come on .
[gasps]
Oh , shit.
Uh , hurry up. Come down now. Come down .
just step down . Go on hurry. Quickly. Go on .
Come on, Melanie, just jump down . come on .
Come on now--you just
step down . Come on .
All right. All right. All right. All right. Jesus.
That's it.
All right.
That's it.
All right, Melanie.
Come on .
Come on . That's it.
just a little more.
Oh my God!
Oh my God .
What a disaster. . .
Oh , man .
Shit.
l think l'm gonna throw up.
No! Don't, don't throw up!
Help me down !
Oh , my God .
Oh .
Oh my God , l am horribly
sorry for having offended Thee
and l detest all my sins because l dread
the loss of heaven and the pain of hell .
Let go.
l ain't lettin' go.
Hurry up before it moves!
Hey, Melanie, just jump, man . Fuck it!
Why don't you jump off something
if you're so freakin' hot to jump ?
Melanie, l'll give you five dollars if you jump.
l know where you got that five dollars!
So l'm offering it to you .
You can take it and shove it up the guy's nose.
Hmm .
Well , are you just gonna stand there
or are you gonna help me down?
l got you .
[groan]
l'm saved .
Wonderful .
lt's moving .
Oh , l think l broke a nail .

No, l don't meet nobody at midnight nowhere.
You'll meet me.

You'll meet me

[breathing]
l don't know, something might happen .
How's your friend, uh, what's his name?
l ain't even going out with him anymore. We broke up.
Oh , yeah? Well, maybe you

All right. l'll meet you .
Don't be late.
Yeah , l'll be there.
Goodbye, Linda.
. . .last few weeks of uncertainty
has ended in the knowledge of the murder of our son
Andrew Goodman . . .

Hope, slim though it was, has passed away
and a painful certainty has come.

Our grief, though personal
Hello, Harry?
Um , oh , l guess Harry's not there then , huh?
Who is this?
lt's Linda. Do you know when Harry'll be home?
l don't know when he'll be back.
Well , could you just tell him that l gotta meet Heinz
at the Oval by the fountain at 1 2 o'clock?
And l'd--l'd feel a
heck of a lot better
if Harry was there too.
Will you tell him that?
All right, l'll tell him .
Okay. Um , goodnight.
. . .people who might go to Mississippi
they will go because many believe
and l have received hundreds
of letters from young people
all over the country expressing this belief.
And if they go, if they choose
to fight for equality along
with the other young people there
they have my heart
and they have
my strength--
Trick or treat.
Harry? Where you been?
Been out walking .
You want a drink?
Come on .
All right.
Guess it didn't go so well, huh?
Why you say that?
'Cause you haven't said yes
to a drink in about a century.
Well , you're right.
lt didn't go great. Went okay.
Where's the Buddha?
l got him locked in the kitchen .
Ma, why'd you lock him in the kitchen?
You're lucky l didn't send him out after you.
l told you not to lock him in the kitchen .
Harry, you've been gone eight hours.
l've been gone six and a half hours.
All right, six and a half hours.
Six and a half hours is a very long time in Harlem .
[sigh]
Mother, you worry too much .
You know what happened today?
No, what happened?
You know those three kids in M ississippi?
Yeah , Goodman , Chaney and Schwerner, what about 'em?
They're dead .
l know they're dead , Ma.

Their parents just found out.
Everybody knows they've been dead for weeks.
What do you mean , everybody?

Oh , boy. Your mother is like insane.
She don't know where you are.
She's sittin' by the phone, staring at the phone
like it was a crystal ball or some shit, Melanie
but it don't ring , 'cause you don't call .
Shut up about my mother!
Don't you mention my frigging' mother to me.

Hell of a dog. St. Bernard, right?
Yeah .
He acts like a friggin' bloodhound .
Yeah , well , they're rescue dogs, you know.
They use 'em for findin' people
that get lost in the Alps.
[police radio, inaudible]
Okay, we'll be right in !
Hey. They just brought in a guy we should see.
(Mazola) Did you see where he went?

Somebody check on Heinz's mother?
We sent a patrolman over there
but the mother said she ain't seen him .
Did the patrolman stay?
No, but l sent over a plainclothes.
Good .
Then let's go. l think we
both had the same stupid idea.

unless you start bustin' my hump. All right?
So give the stupid dog the stupid sweater to smell
and let's see what happens!
[sniffing]
He's smellin' it.
