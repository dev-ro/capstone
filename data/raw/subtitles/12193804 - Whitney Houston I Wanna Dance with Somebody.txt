Okay.
Alone would be great.
It's what I was trying to...
Okay.yeah.
Clive: So, do you write songs?
No.
Have you ever tried? Mm-mm.
Is that okay? Yeah.
We'll just get people
to write them for you.
Now, what kind of songs
do you like?
[Breathing deeply] Hm.
Great big songs.
"Great big songs"?
[Both chuckle]
Yeah. All right, great big songs.
Yeah, that you almost
can't wrap your arms around.
Songs that are like
climbing a mountain,
that'll stretch me
vocally, that...
I really gotta sing
my raggedy ass off to sell.
Gospel? Country? Black? White?
All the above.
All the above? Mm-hm.
All of them.
A great song is a great song.
And you are 100% correct
on that.
Okay. So, then,
what we're gonna do
is we're gonna hire the finest
songwriters in america...
In the world,
to write a great big
vocally-ambitious song
for a great new
vocally-ambitious star.
What do you think?
Believe they'd do that for me? No.
But they'll do it for us.
[Chuckles]
Okay, so... can I...
Can I ask you something?
Yeah, you can ask me anything.
I'm an open book, Whitney,
just so you know.
Even though people say
that the text size is so small
that you need
very strong glasses.
[Laughs]What do you wanna know?
You went to Harvard?
Law, yeah.
What was that like?
Well, stressful.
Actually, anxiety attacks.
I had...
Right here, darling.Sure.
Thank you so much.
Thank you. You're welcome.
But, you know, you work through
it. I worked through it.
How? Uh, how?
Exercises. Breathing exercises.
[Breathes deeply]
[Laughs] I do that too.
Yeah, but I did it, of course,
you know, away from
everyone because...
You know, you have to remember
that in those days,
and this was a long time ago...
In those days,
you couldn't admit
that there was ever
anything wrong with you.
And can you now?
I want to tell you one thing,
dear Whitney, before we begin.
I never get involved in the
personal lives of my artists.
I am not a babysitter,
I'm not a camp counselor,
I'm not a rabbi.
I know music.
I have an ear,
and I have an instinct.
And in this respect,
I can serve you.
And I will be there for you
at any hour.
Okay? Okay.
To you. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Mm.
Okay. Let's test that ear.
He said he can get me on TV,
and we drank champagne.
And, mommy, he called me
"vocally ambitious."
You let her come out
looking like this?
She ain't got a dress?
She needs to start
wearing a dress.
I told her to dress up. Why?
These are my nice jeans.
[In unison] Nice jeans?
Yeah, well, it's just me.
Yeah, well,
they don't wanna see "just you,"
and being nippy
ain't gonna get it.
And you need to take her
wig shopping.
If she's gonna go all the way,
hair short as mine
is not going to get it done.
You're a Princess.
With that voice and the looks,
you could be america's Princess.
Start looking like one.
Tough business, baby, I know.
I'm just gonna sing.
My next guest
has nurtured such superstars
as Barry manilow,
Melissa Manchester,
Chicago, Simon and Garfunkel,
Janis joplin...
And the list is endless.
Today, he's brought
his latest discovery with him,
and she is, in two words,
simply breathtaking.
Oh, god, I think
I'm gonna throw up.
No, no, no, no.
You got this in the bag,
Princess.
Come on now. Come on. Stand up.
Baby, get her something
to drink.
Some ginger ale, some soda pop...
Something like that. All right.
Hey. Hey.Mommy.
You're gonna be fine.
Just pretend you're singing
in the shower.
[Exhales sharply] You want me
to imagine I'm singing butt naked
in front of merv Griffin?[Laughs]
Come on. It's not helping.
Remember...
Head, heart, gut. Right?
Yeah.
You're my Princess.
All right? All right. Come
on. Clive: You know.
You just know
that you're in the presence...
You know what to do... of somebody special.

Thank you much!
And good night!
Dj: Well, it's a criticism I
increasingly hear from callers.
Whitney:
That I'm not black enough?
No, your music.
Your music isn't black enough.
What would you like me to say?
The truth.
Aren't you selling out?
Whew.
Whitney: You've got a
lot of nerve asking me that.
That's what my mother tells me.
It's a valid question.
A common criticism of you
and your music.
That you're a sellout.
That you're not
a real black artist.
You're about to walk
out, aren't you? No.
You'll be walking out
before I will.
How do you respond?
If I'm not a black artist,
what am I?
You tell me.
Look, I don't know
how to sing black,
and I don't know how
to sing white either.
I know how to sing.
Music is not a color to me.
It has no boundaries.
Why somebody gotta say
something dumbass like that?
I mean, who said that?
That's just bull.
And it makes me angry, actually.
It's hateful and uninformed.
Why I gotta be what someone
wants me to be anyway?
Sing what I want to sing.
Be how I want to be.
Reach as big an audience
as I can.
Isn't that what art's
meant to do?
My whole life,
"she ain't black enough.
She ain't white enough."
Well, how about,
"she's not obedient enough"?
How about,
"she ain't fearful enough"?
Hm.
Hm.
Well, you heard it from Whitney
herself, ladies and gentlemen.
Was that too much? Hell no.
All right.
[♪♪♪]
[Movers chattering indistinctly]
Morning, Max.
Mr. Houston.
[Chuckles]
Look at this.
Here you are. Good morning.
Thank you.
Use it wisely.
Anna.
Interviewer:
Are you a businesswoman?
Yes, I think so.
What does a businesswoman do?
Well, what does
a businesswoman do?
She says what she doesn't want.
Good morning. Whitney: And she knows,
primarily, what she wants.
That's a pretty tough thing
to have to determine sometimes,
you know?
Most of the people
that work with me,
the people I have known
for many years,
you know, they're people,
competent people
I can trust to look out for me
and to do their job well.
But it's hard sometimes
to make the transition
from being the friend
to the boss
or from the boss to the friend.
Or from the daughter to the boss
or the boss to the daughter.
You know, you have to wear
different hats at times.
So, you are a tough cookie?
Sometimes.
Always? Not always, no. Sometimes.
That means sometimes.
Daddy, what is it?
I want you to fire her.
Robyn is a nobody.
The Bible tells us,
"do not be misled.
Bad company corrupts
good character.
Walk with god, not the devil."
Daddy... I need her gone.
Daddy, there is nothing
going on.
She is a bad influence.
And the press
is talking too much trash.
It's damaging the brand.
Do you understand?
Since when...
[Door closes]Since
when did your little girl
become "the brand"?
I missed that.
Your mama would have killed
to become a brand.
We just couldn't get her there.
I'm not firing Robyn.
I need her. I need somebody
I can trust 100%.
You can trust me 100%.
Or you better damn do.
Now you go do as I tell you.
I'm the manager here.
I know you are. You work for me.
You don't say.
Daddy...
I do.
How is that, to become the boss
of your own family?
Of your brothers
and their wives?
Of your own father and mother?
Or are you still
the "little girl" sometimes?
Sometimes.
Martin: Now, look here,
you stupid, little broad.
Don't you talk to me like that.
I'll talk to you any way I like.
You know who I am?
You think I let dames
get away with anything?
Clive [over phone]:
Yes? Clive, I wanna do a movie.
What?
A movie.
Why?
We'll find you a movie. Sure.
Okay. Night.
Martin: You didn't ask but you
wanted. I did my share. What about you?
Who do you think you are,
you can be so particular?
You're nothing.
You get funny with me,
and I'll throw you right back
to that crummy dance joint
where I found you.
[Camera shutters clicking]
How are you feeling? Here she comes.
Whitney!
There she is.
Whitney "whitey" Houston!
Whitney "whitey" Houston!
Pay no attention. Come on.
Shame on you! Shame on you!
Whitney "whitey" Houston!
Whitney "whitey" Houston!
Who was that? I don't know. Come on.
No, I don't wanna talk
to nobody.
Mrs. Houston! Just stay focused.
Keep it together. What's going on?

Bobby: ♪ yeah, do it like this ♪

Whitney: Girl, I swear to god.

And I'MMA do it again.
Oh.
Hey!

What are you doing?
Yo, I'm not even

Hey, hey, hey. What's up?[Laughs]
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I'm really sorry.
You're Bobby brown, right?
Yeah. Yeah. What about it?
I got a question for you.
And what's that?
How old are you?
Old enough.
He's old enough.
He's old enough, you know.
He's old enough.
Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen,

She looks so good. So good.

[Janet speaking indistinctly]
John: You got to be prepared.
You know, the kind of success
that you're enjoying,
that the black stations
ain't got no control over
and they don't own,
it drives 'em crazy.
Oreo. They calling me an oreo.
If they wanna see black,
I'll show 'em black.
No, you don't.
Don't you go changing nothing.
You keep on doing

And you are the first, Princess.

Whitney: I've been thinking
we should get new writers.
A new sound.
R & b.
Yeah.
You know,
L.A. Reid and babyface
are doing some really
interesting stuff right now.
And they might be right
to produce your next album.
We can look into that.
You want to?
Okay.
Don't be sad. Come on.
That's better.
Now get out of my chair.
Reporter: And here they are,
Whitney Houston and Bobby brown.
They're just arriving here
at the billboard music awards.
She's nominated
for four awards tonight,
including top r & b album
and top r & b artist.
Do you want a hug?
It's okay, baby. It's okay.
Thank you so much.
Hi, Whitney. You and Bobby are

How does that feel?
It feels very good.

Y'all wanna see a kiss?
Baby, you look so good.

Hey, whit.
[Softly] Get ready.
[Normally] How's the voice?
Fine, rickey. How's yours?
I've been working on something
new to finish your show.
But it's big.
I got a show
full of big already.
Mm-mm. Not big like this. What is it?
It's a three-song medley
sung straight through.
Starting with
"I loves you, porgy."
Moving on to
"and I am telling you."
No, don't do that.
Don't do that.
And finishing with
"I have nothing."
[Sighs] Rickey... yeah?
What goes through
your thick head
when you're bringing me
this shit?
What?
Those three songs together,
they're almost unsingable
on their own.
Together that's like
climbing mount Everest.
Without oxygen.
And you're the only singer
on the planet
that could pull this off.
That's why I'm suggesting it.
This could be very special.
But, you know,
if it's too hard, I mean...
Let me see.
Come on. You know this stuff.
It's about heartbreak
and the people we need.
Fighting to hold onto them.
What's that? The key change?
It's just a key change.
It's just a key change?
For your big finish.

Mrs. Brown, right? Don't touch my face.
You wanna mess with me,
Mrs. Brown?
Don't touch me like that.
Get off me.
Hey. Don't you ever,

Get out.
Don't you dare. Don't you dare.
Get out of my house, Bobby.
Oh, man.
Hey, all right. All right, baby.
But check this.
You crazy!
You wanna see crazy? Yeah, yeah, you crazy.
You wanna see crazy?
There's something wrong
up there.
Get out of my house, Bobby!
Get out of my house![Baby crying]
We don't want you here!
I ain't going nowhere!
Get out of my house!
Give me my baby. This is my house too!
Give me my baby. Yes, ma'am.
I'm not going nowhere.

No. No, daddy.
You put me

A huge-ass world tour.
Your voice can handle it.
I'll cut this deal,

So you just keep singing,

Maybe you wanna apply for that.

Reporter 1:
Bobby brown arrested yesterday.
Reporter 2: On the heels
of winning her sixth grammy,
Whitney Houston stood by her
husband in court today,
who was arrested
for violating probation.
Despite all the problems
Houston and brown
have encountered,
his stint at a rehab clinic
and rumors of his
entertaining other women,
the couple insists they are
still very much in love.
Well, this is cissy Houston.
Tell nippy, Whitney,
Ms. Houston to call her mother.
Behind her closely
guarded facade,
the wholesome singer's life
is in turmoil.
Assistant: Hey, Robyn.
Whitney's a little tied up right now,
but she says she'll see you
when she comes back
from the tour.

Why'd you cancel the show,
Whitney?
Are you high right now?
Have you lost your voice?
What happened to your voice?
Hey, Whitney. Are you high?
Hello.
Come on.
Hey.hello.
Hi.hi.
Hi.hello. How you doing?
I'm okay.
I'm okay. Nice to see you.
Hello, sweetheart.
How are you? Come on in.Good.
Come on in.
How was the trip? It was good.
Was it? Good.Yeah.
Where's the dog?
What dog? The dog.
She's been talking about
your dog for the longest time.
I don't have a dog.
You don't?[Laughs]
Hey, marble. Look what he's got.
Come on, marble.
Go get the dog, marble.

Bobbi:
Marble, come back! Come back!
Cute guy.
Who is he?
I'm an open book, Whitney.
Yeah. Mm-hm.
Yeah, that you need
damn strong glasses to read.
Boy. I did not see that coming.
Well, that makes two of us.
Come here and sit with me.
And I want you to be happy too,
my dear friend.
Okay? Yes.
So the real reason that
I asked you to come up here.
Dear Whitney, the time has come
for me to tell you... mm-hm.
That you need rehab.
Okay?
The number of problems
that are arising
indicate that you're not
gonna win this battle.
And that you're underestimating
the lethal power of drugs.
[Sniffles]
Do you hear me?
I thought you didn't meddle
in the personal lives
of your artists.
Before you, in entertainment,
whether you're a Judy garland
or you're a Janis...
They end up losing.
You can't do it yourself.
You can't.
And how sad, I mean...
For you to affect your voice...
To affect everything.
It's criminal. I'm fine.
Really, I am. You know, I
got it under control. Mm-hm.
I just need to let my hair down
sometimes. Can't I do that?
You see these?
You're on the cover
of every one of them.
And no longer for your
music. I beat the Beatles.
I beat Elvis.
I was the first black,
all-American,
white-friendly girl.
But that ain't me.
Clive, I gave up a lot.
I know. I know.
But... I can't leave it
this way.
This is a matter
of life and death.
You need to let me help you.
Meddling.
Deal with it. Now.
You know...
Some of your favorite
performances of mine...
I needed help.
To sing with the gods,
sometimes you need a ladder.
No, Whitney.
From the first time
that I saw you...
I knew you didn't need a ladder.
The gods were already there.
Mommy. I want a dog, mommy.
Hey. You want a dog?
You want a dog? You can have
anything you want, baby.

And you better pay me

Daddy, what money?
My piece
from that new record deal
that I negotiated for you
with arista.
I negotiated that.
I took care of it.
Okay, like you're taking care

One hundred million dollars.
There's no one hundred million.
They pay by the album, and I
haven't done any new albums yet.
As of right now,
it's almost all gone.

Reporter:
Whitney Houston's comeback tour
is not faring well
for the iconic singer.
Her latest show in Denmark left
hundreds of fans walking out
and asking for their money back.
Woman: It was obvious.
It was quickly obvious that
there was a major problem.
Her vocal range
was seriously diminished.
She was fine
within a certain limit.
But when she ventured
from that safety zone,
she was in trouble.
And Whitney has always been
distinguished
by her range of notes.
Reporter: Houston is one
of the top-selling artists
of all time, with six grammys
and a mezzo-soprano that earned
her the nickname "the voice."
Whitney now needs
more than her...
Go for a shot.
Okay.
Reporter: And Whitney Houston
just arrived at the Beverly Hilton.
Lots of speculation
that she will also perform
at clive Davis's grammy party
later this evening.
Paparazzo:
Ms. Houston, this way!
Are you going back to rehab?
Whitney: Hey, get
them ready to do "home."
Rickey: Does clive know?
Whitney:
Yeah, I'm singing tonight.
I don't think
that's a good idea.
It's not what clive wants,
and it's not
what I want for you.
Did you see me sing on Oprah?
Yeah, I saw you on Oprah.Okay.
I saw you in Copenhagen too.
People wanna see
Whitney Houston.
You set that standard.
I know.
I know I'm not
where I used to be.
But I know how to get there.
I'm not going away.
I can't lose this.
This? This one night?
Yes, yes. This one night.
Me singing for them.
I can't live without it.
I'm gonna be ready.
You need to be.
If you're ready,
I'm there for you, whit.
I always am, but...
If you're not ready though...
Rickey?
Just get ready to do "home."
I'm gonna sing it...
And you're gonna like it.
[Humming]
Do you think this carpet
needs a vacuum?
[Phone buzzing]
Mom, are you nervous? No.
No. No, I'm excited.
I'm so excited.
You know what?
I gotta go downstairs
and get some more honey.
Why don't you go to your room?
I'm gonna get ready
for tonight, okay?
I'm gonna make you so proud.
I love you in perpetuity.
Both: Throughout the universe.
Yeah, that's it.
You got it, baby.
Okay.
Whitney, can we get
a picture, please?
Miss Houston!
Can we take a picture with you? Sure.
All right.
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much! Okay. Sure.
Whitney.
Do you think I could have
your autograph?
Yeah.
Thank you, Whitney.
Thank you.

Can I get a tea, please?
Thank you.
With pleasure.
Would you?
Super, massive fan.
Sure. Ahem.
Oh. Don't worry, I got one.
Spencer.spencer.
So it's true?
You're performing tonight
at that pre-grammy party?
You heard that?
It's out there. Everybody knows.
There's gonna be
a whole lineup of huge stars,
but you're gonna outshine them
all. You always do.
Thank you. Thank you.
Girl, can I tell you something?
Yeah.
I saw you live once, in '94.
The American music awards.Yeah.
I was a seat filler.
Girl, you did
that medley of songs.
Yeah.goddamn.
[Laughs]
You liked it?
That's the greatest performance
I've ever seen.
Thank you. As far as I'm concerned,
you're the greatest of all time.
I really appreciate that.
I do. Thank you.
[Inaudible]
But it was...
It was 18 years ago.
So...
